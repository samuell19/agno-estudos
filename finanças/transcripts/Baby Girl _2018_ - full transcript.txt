(DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (RINGING) (TRAIN HORN BLARING) (TRAIN RATTLING) (TENSE MUSIC) (LAUGHING) CODY: Dad. He was the only one who understood me. Daddy? (GUNSHOT) (SHRILL RINGING) (TENSE MUSIC) I did something terrible, and I'm sure it'll catch up with me someday. (CHUCKLES) Just not yet. (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'm still in high school, and I'm being investigated for murder. What I say next will determine the rest of my miserable life. It's not the way you wanna spend your 18th birthday. Miss Fields, I'm Detective Antonio Velez. I'm a criminal psychologist with the FBI. Now you're aware that this conversation's being recorded, correct? CODY: Yeah. Good. I'm gonna ask you a few questions and I'm gonna trust that you're gonna answer me honestly. I'm not a snitch. Okay. Okay, how about we start from the beginning? (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TRACKS RATTLING) CODY: I can see why people hurt themselves. It's not a complicated reason. It's to make a point. To let people know how it feels to hurt. Writing is my only solace. I wish I could talk to people the way I write. Now what do we got here? Fuck Willis, give me that back. I'm serious, give it to me. I don't want you to read that, don't. Don't look at me like that. I wasn't, I swear. Yeah you were. (COUGHS) Go ahead. (COUGHING) Quit trying to be someone you're not. And remember that you're a sweet guy, Willis. Stick to it. Chicks hate nice dudes. I mean, they do want excitement, but in the end, they want someone who's gonna love them and care about them and understand them, you know? - Well read me something then. - No, you wouldn't understand. You've always underestimated me. Fine. This one's called The Hurt. Okay? "The hurt, the pain, the agony. "Torn, screaming limbs, intertwined destruction. "Souls shatter, innocent, heavens gush blood "down conscious gullets. "The hurt, the pain, the agony. "Quenched evil? "Never." Damn. That's what's stirring inside of you? I fuckin' knew it. (WILLIS LAUGHS) I didn't mean it that way, all right? Come on Cody. Is our lives always gonna be this miserable? WILLIS: Don't say that. (COUGHS) Don't you understand, though? This place is the soul's gymnasium, exercising us to... CODY: I should be dead. Instead, my dad is dead. Whatever. There's a comfort in death. A sense of finality. (TENSE MUSIC) God. 40 mind numbing years on this planet. What the hell do I have to show for it? (KNOCKING) What are you doing? Moving on. It's about time you do the same. Moving on? You're acting like dad never even existed. Grow up Cody. Jesus. Trying to erase me from your memory just like you're doing to dad? Trying to make it like I never existed either? I'm still here. Cody, marriages go through stages and then a child comes along... Here we go again, and that's my cue. You never let me explain myself. Cody. A week ago, a woman was found dead in her home on Santa Fe Avenue. Her name was Carrie Womack, better known as Diablo. Carrie Womack? Now, we know that she ran a porn and prostitution enterprise in her home. And I'm sure that you were well aware of that. All right now that's just small time business, but her clients on the other hand were into some other things, and that's why I'm here. I wanna know who they are, and your involvement. Now that I got your attention, is it true that you knew Carrie? I knew Diablo, not Carrie. And you were there the night that she died? You wouldn't even believe me if I told you. Were you good friends with her? How long did you know her? Yeah. We were friends. Would you care to be a little bit more specific, please? We were more than friends, detective. Oh. Okay. (CHUCKLES) How did you meet Diablo? (CODY CHUCKLES) Well, I first saw her like around the streets and I thought she was a pretty strange woman. (TENSE MUSIC) (SIGHS) (TENSE MUSIC) It all started with her. And in a way, it ends with her, too. That's a nice knife. What the fuck? You're scared of me, I get it. We all get scared sometimes. If you like, I can help you. I don't roll your way. I'm all about the process, baby. (CODY SCOFFS) That retro deal you're sportin', yeah, it's not really workin' for you. Revolution lover, sex, drugs, world domination. (TENSE MUSIC) Indica. Cultivated in the manure of the gods. (TENSE MUSIC) (INSECTS BUZZING) Get an occupation, slut. Shit, what the fuck? My knife.

Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes. Doesn't anybody ever listen to me? I'm not hungry. Spoiled brat. But that all changed, and now I have changed as well. Somewhere along the way...

You don't even drink. (COUGHING) Fuckin' light weight, man. Why are you always so crappy to me? It's a mood, don't take it personally. 18 years. That's a long time lingering in melancholy. Well it sucks being born a chick, okay? You have no idea. And you think being a dude's any easier? Fuck yeah. Yeah, maybe if you, you know, can throw a perfect spiral or sport the looks of Nicolas Holt. Oh my god, us women, preggo with these little aliens, lugging around for a millennium in there. Don't laugh, I'm serious. Gettin' all stretch marked up and shit while you assholes are screwin' behind our backs. You are so cynical, I swear. At least I'm not dweeby and greasy. Screw you Cody. Just give me it. Fuck off Willis. Look what you did. (GRUNTS) You are a wandering shit storm, you know that Cody? (CODY CHUCKLES) Maybe I am. Does it look like I give a fuck? (SCOFFS) No, it doesn't. (SOFT MUSIC) I don't give a fuck. (TRAIN BELL RINGING) (TENSE MUSIC) MASON: Easy there, Cody bear. CODY: Daddy. (TRACKS RATTLING) Please forgive me. Fancy meeting you here. Can't seem to shake you. You're like a bad virus, impossible to get rid of. There's something to be said about persistence, baby. Or maybe this is fate. I just picked up. What? My stop is next, my place is close. Come over, I'll make you happy. I doubt it. Don't be scared of the devil. I got drugs and whatever else your earthly heart may desire. Unless you're afraid of little Diablo. Diablo? (LAUGHS) Is that a nickname or are you the real McCoy? You can't be that much of a dork. (TRACKS RATTLING) Would a dork have these? Next stop, fucked up. (TENSE MUSIC) (INSECTS BUZZING) Wait up bitch. Exactly where are we going? Your salvation awaits. Speechless? For once. Yeah. Are you scared? I wish I could go back and be your age again. Nothing scares me anymore, not even death itself. For the first time in my life, I'm terrified. But I like it. I remember the feeling. (DRAMATIC SYNTH MUSIC) CODY: I knew she was a bad influence, but, that's what I was looking for. I wish I had never stepped off that train that night. If I could take it back, I would.

(FILM REEL ROLLING) (TENSE MUSIC) (SYNTH MUSIC) I'm a bitch full of exotic tastes, Cody. How do you know my name? Hm, how do you know me? Don't. Que pasa? Esta bien. I'm totally in sync with you. Oh really? Mhm. May I? (SOFT MUSIC) Yummy bone structure. Quite a unique look. Don't disguise what the Lord has blessed you with. (SOFT MUSIC) Don't. No look, I'm not into that. I'm gonna rip the beating heart from the person who ruined your self esteem. Hey. If you were mine. Now let me take your picture, you're so beautiful. (CAMERA CLICKS) (CAMERA CLICKS) It's so yummy.

There you go. Stand up straighter. Open your eyes, let me see how pretty you look. (TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Look up. (CHUCKLES) CODY: Enough. You got your shot already. Ugh. Petulance, it becomes you. Well you're not gonna get famous that way. (TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Oh. (SIGHS) (TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) CODY: I miss the times when the only problem I had was trying to sneak out. I miss the trivial things in life. Now things are just so complicated with my mom and I. I wish my dad were still here. I taught you to use a glass, young lady. (BURPING) Regardless of your perception, I do care about you. CODY: Whatever. You just make it so hard for me to like you sometimes. It's a conundrum wrapped in an enigma, floating in a pile of dung. Right, Jennifer? You just proved my point. Don't call me Jennifer. I'm your mother for Christ's sake. CODY: Not sure why I treat my mom the way I do. I'm sure it comes from the way she treated my dad. He used to be lucky, but, that's the problem with luck: it eventually just runs out. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) What the hell is that? A tooth. (COUGHS) CODY: What the hell are you doing with all of dad's clothes? He certainly doesn't need 'em now, does he? Just stop it. What the hell do you think you're doing? Give me the fucking shirt! Give it! - Gimme it! - God! You never had any respect for dad, did you? Never. This little delusion you've held for Mason. He was no martyr, Cody. You're such a bitch. God. What did you say to me? (TENSE MUSIC) You're doing great. Keep goin'. (TENSE MUSIC) The shit show really started after my dad died, and he had an affair, and when my mom found out, she fuckin' lost it. She started screaming, he was devastated, she wanted him out. You know, it was a shit show. I know what you did. And she wanted a divorce and then later that night was when my dad died. It was just hard for me to take everything in. (BUBBLING) (TENSE MUSIC) (TENSE MUSIC) What does it feel like? The burns. Escape. Salvation. Rebirth. Can you do me? (CHUCKLES) (TENSE MUSIC) (SIZZLING) (TENSE MUSIC) (CODY SIGHS) Do it again. (CHUCKLES) (TENSE MUSIC) (SIZZLING) (TENSE MUSIC) It feels so good. (CHUCKLING) (TENSE MUSIC) Everything moved so quickly.

(MOANING) (TENSE MUSIC) (TRACKS RATTLING) Aren't you gonna be late for school? Isn't it a bit early for one of your trauma dramas? What is this on your arm? Why do you care? Okay, get off of me. I thought you were over your self-mutilation fad. We're not even close to being done. (CODY GASPS) (GRUNTING) (SLAPPING) (GRUNTING) (SOBBING) (TENSE MUSIC) CODY: Daddy. (SOBBING) It should've been me. You ruined our lives, Cody. (SOBBING) It should've been... Say it. It should've been me. Cody, I didn't mean it like that. (SOBBING) Dad. Oh, fuck. (HEAVY BREATHING) You know, like, losing my dad is where it all went wrong. When he died, I died, and I just didn't really know it yet. (SIGHS) You know, my dad always told me that life was a gamble so I should learn when to cash out. It felt good not to be so powerless for a change. For the first time since I lost my dad, there was something to break up the monotony that had become my life. I needed that. Now tell me more about your friend. I need to know more about Diablo. She saved me. She was a drug and that's how she casted me under her spell. (SYNTH POP MUSIC) (DOOR CLOSES) (SOFT MUSIC) What's wrong? What happened? Easy there, baby, Diablo's here. Easy there, baby. Shh. Easy there. (SOFT MUSIC) Why does she hate me so much? (SOFT MUSIC) Everything's gonna be all right. Esta bien. (SOFT MUSIC) - You see me. - Embrace your feelings, Cody. (SOFT MUSIC) (INSECTS BUZZING) (SYNTH MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (SYNTH MUSIC) I need a place to crash for a couple of days. Mi casa es su casa. I need to make some extra cash. Get independent. Do you have any ideas? What are your qualifications? Uh, I did like a stint in retail, stocking, register, shit like that, it's stupid. How far are you willing to push the envelope for some real cash? No limits, D. (CHUCKLES) (SOFT SYNTH MUSIC) My dad gave this to me. Jesus was crucified on a star, not a cross. What do you mean? A stake, like this. I thought that Bible said... Constantine created the illusion of the cross to control the masses. (DIABLO LAUGHS) I want that back. It's Pagan, Cody. You're not one of those, are you? CODY: Give it to me. Please. Real love isn't contained in a physical thing. So choose. Me or the cross. (SOFT SYNTH MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) Were you aware that Diablo was running a porn and prostitution ring out of her home? That's the word around the street. Actually, you were a willing participant. Why? Do I need a lawyer? Cody. You're gonna go to jail for a really long time unless you decide to participate. Now I need to know who Diablo was working with. We met like a few days ago. She had some old man staying with her. What was his name? Um, she called him the Gas Man. Him, the Gas Man. The Gas Man? What was his real name? That's, that's not how it worked around there. Don't play coy with me. I can ruin the rest of your fuckin' life. (SCOFFS) (MAN GRUNTING) (TENSE MUSIC) CODY: The Gas Man, that's what she called him. (MAN GRUNTING) He always has his tank that he wheels around with him. (MAN GRUNTING) Ooh, how's my Gas Man? Oh. (GRUNTS) Oh. (CHUCKLES) It's been a long time. I thought she might be too young at first, but when I found out she was 18, I knew you'd love her. (INHALES) CODY: I need a place to crash for a couple of days. DIABLO: Mi casa es su casa. I wanna taste before you put her on the market. Well as long as you keep things running smoothly on your end, you can have her any time you like. You just name the time and place, daddy. I don't deserve you, Diablo. No, you don't. CODY: I need to make some cash. I wanna get independent. DIABLO: What are your qualifications? CODY: I did like a stint in retail, stocking, register, stupid shit like that. Stupid stuff. (SOFT MUSIC) Thanks for getting here so quickly. I'm worried about Cody. She's drinking and cutting on herself again. I don't recognize her anymore. I don't recognize myself anymore. Mrs. Fields, what are you doing? Enjoying the vantage point, Willis. Um. Is everything okay with you guys? Hey. Stop. Oh, you sure know how to ruin a mood young man. What are you doing? JENNIFER: Are you cutting too? No. See. Is Cody going to school? I don't, we don't really run in the same circles. Secrets, Willis. Not good among friends. We are friends, right? Um, yeah, I guess. If you say so, Mrs. Fields. Has Cody mentioned anything to you about her dad? Nope. Taboo subject mostly. Why? I know you don't want anything bad to happen - to her, Willis. - No, I don't. Talk to her for me. Find out what's going on. Before something really... You don't think she'd? That's what I'm worried about Willis. (TENSE MUSIC) This is off the fucking charts weird, D. Can we try somethin' else? Stick to the script. No boundaries, remember? (TENSE MUSIC) (SNIFFING) Ready, lover? Let's fuckin' do it. That's my girl. Keep the action going no matter what, understand? Now sit back and fiddle with the phone like a child. Okay, talent. I'm ready. (GAS MAN GRUNTING) And, action. (GAS MAN GRUNTING) (TENSE MUSIC) What the hell kind of caretaker are you? I pay you to clean and cook! Sit around all day fiddling with that damn phone. I was just, I'll get dinner ready. Too late young lady. You need to learn some respect. Bring her over. You bring her over. You're the boss. (INHALING) (TENSE MUSIC) (INHALING) (EXHALES) (GRUNTING) CODY: Stop, daddy. Please, please. (SLAPPING) (CODY WINCES) - (SLAPPING) - Huh, you like it? Oh, you love it. - Ow. - Oh, god. (TENSE MUSIC) (INHALING) (EXHALES) (TENSE MUSIC) Baby. Wanna fuck? Baby you wanna fuck? Deep throat it, baby. Lips taut on his dick, no teeth. No limits, right? (KISSES) (TENSE MUSIC) MASON: You have to forgive yourself, Cody. (LAUGHING) (TENSE MUSIC) That was amazing. You are a rare gem. You're not gonna break on me now, are you? Where's the fucking cash? Always on task, that's one of your most enduring qualities. (TENSE MUSIC) Mason, I'm tired of your excuses. They're gonna take the house, you know that? (MASON SIGHS) I've racked my brain, I don't know what else to do. Wait tables, wash dishes, flip burgers. God, is that beneath you too? It's tough out there, Jennifer. You have no idea. (TENSE MUSIC) Would you position it like this, Mason? Nah, would you reposition it like this? (TENSE MUSIC) Do you only like one bullet? Hm. You'll probably learn in two. (TENSE MUSIC) Like that? Just like that. (TENSE MUSIC) MASON: Easy there, Cody Bear. Fuck. (CODY SIGHS) (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) You can do this. It's only your body. Money equals freedom. JENNIFER: Mason, money is freedom. (SOFT MUSIC) (LAUGHING) MASON: There, that looks good. Very nice. (LAUGHS) I like having you around. (LAUGHING) (TENSE MUSIC) DIABLO: Kiss each other. (TENSE MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (CODY COUGHS) CODY: Diablo. You look great Cody. You two, grab her and set her down. (TENSE MUSIC) Gently. You, stay standing. You, get on your knees. Move her hair out of her face. (TENSE MUSIC) Very slowly, touch her neck and then I want you to stick your tongue on her face. (TENSE MUSIC) So good. Oh you're such a good boy. Come on Cody. Okay, okay. Good, good boy. Good boy. Put your hand on her knee. Slowly run it up her leg. (TENSE MUSIC) Up her arm. (TENSE MUSIC) And move her hair out of her face again. Yeah. That's great. (TENSE MUSIC) Okay, okay, okay. Good boy, good boy. You. Slowly take your dick out of your pants and put it in her face. We're gonna get a good show, good boy. (TENSE MUSIC) Where are you going? Where are you going? Get off of me. Diablo! Look what I found outside. Fuckin' little pervert. Sit down. CODY: Willis? Cody, I... CODY: What the fuck are you doing here? You know this perv? (TENSE MUSIC) Get back to work, the camera's still rolling. No, I can't, not with him watching me. Get back to work. CODY: What they fuck are you doing here? DIABLO: Don't you fuckin' say no to me. Fuckin' tell me no. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Don't fucking smile at me. - Stop hitting her. Rip her clothes off. - No. - Stop. Get the fuck off of me you fucking assholes, get off of me! Fuck off of me. Get that out of my face! DIABLO: This is such good shit. (laughs) WILLIS: You need to stop. You're a big man, huh? Kiss the gun little boy. Suck him off Cody. CODY: No, Diablo. Fuckin' adrenaline rush. That's some Andy Warhol and Jim Jarmusch shit. Do it. Do it Diablo. I fucking dare you. This is your fucking money shot. Do it, go ahead! DIABLO: Film us. Do it Diablo. You're gonna take your dick out little boy. Smile for the camera. (TENSE MUSIC) (WILLIS BREATHING HEAVILY) If his dick comes out, you'll fucking lose me forever. I hope you know that. DIABLO: And what happens if he squeals to 5-0? He won't. How do you know? Because I fucking say so. (TENSE MUSIC) Get the fuck out of here. (TENSE MUSIC) WILLIS: Cody, let's go. Let's get out of here. Get over here. (HEAVY BREATHING) (TENSE MUSIC) Down here, film his dick. (HEAVY BREATHING) (LAUGHS) What the fuck were you thinking? Why are you punishing yourself like this? Willis, you need to leave. Is, is this because of your dad? Shut up, Willis. Because it wasn't your fault. Shut up, Willis, you don't know what you're talking about. Tell me what happened that night. I can't. We gotta go to the police. Are you fucking kidding me, Willis? She's not a fuck around person. You can't, you can't go back in there. Willis, she will end us both. Burn that into your fucking head. Look at me, Willis, look at me. If you love me as much as you say you do, you will fucking get the hell out of here and never look back, ever. Okay? (TENSE MUSIC) (INSECTS BUZZING) (SYNTH MUSIC) You are one piece of work, Cody Fields. (LAUGHS) Don't ever fuck with my head like that again. You're a control freak, I get it. We're both very dominating personalities. But one of us has to be submissive sometimes. We both know who that is. (DIABLO LAUGHS) (SYNTH MUSIC) My knife. I knew you took it. (SYNTH MUSIC) (DIABLO BREATHING HEAVILY) Do it. (SYNTH MUSIC) (DIABLO BREATHING HEAVILY) (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) No deceptions, loyalty and death, this I promise. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) (LAUGHING) Okay, so, how much money did you come up upon? Money? Yeah, you know the money that you helped her earn. Don't play naive with me Cody. Okay, so that's what this is about. It's a money thing. It's not a life or death thing, it's money. You see... I think you're lyin'. I think you knew exactly where the money was and that you and your mommy split it. Now if you were involved with her the way that you say that you were, you would know exactly what was going on. Maybe you were even involved. Are you serious? You're gonna sit here and investigate me? For what? Falling for the wrong person? Okay look, this is your last chance. The next time that I walk through that door, I'm not gonna be able to help you again. And I do wanna help you. But you gotta help me, all right? You help me, help you. You know, like losing my dad is where it all went wrong. When he died, I died, and I just didn't really know it yet. Then I later learned that my life would change because of this woman, like she blamed me for my father's death. She followed me to Willis's house, which is like my best friend, and then she randomly like came up to me and like wanted to be friends and she started stalking me. Then she like approached me at the train station, and I found out that she was following me for a while now and then, then Diablo followed me like on my way home from school and outside my friend's house. Like everywhere. She even hacked into all my computers. This all happened behind my back, like, out of nowhere. I never really thought about it until she kept following me because she would follow me more and more, like, as time went by. Look, didn't you talk to my mom about all this? Like do I have to keep explaining myself to you? Yeah, but I wanna hear it from you. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Okay. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Pain is pleasure to me. I like the feeling of pain. That's where I get most of my pleasure. It's becoming a habit for me. This habit of mine, has turned out to be troublesome. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Ew, I look gross. You stay standing and get on your knees. Are we looking at the same person? Baby, get over yourself. We got 100,000 hits in 10 minutes. Damn. There's really that many people into this shit? They're not just into this, they're into you. I wish I could see what they see. All I see is this fucking miserable girl who fucking hates herself. Diablo! DIABLO: Okay, okay. CODY: I don't wanna be like my parents. We can be whoever we wanna be, Cody. It's our world. We make the rules. Most losers live in the past or in the future. Real control is living in the moment. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) You can add disgusting tramp to one of your enduring qualities, Cody. Do it sensually. And slut, too. (SOFT MUSIC) (PEOPLE MOANING) MAN: Open your mouth. WOMAN: What? (laughs) MAN: Shit. WOMAN: Oh my god. Yeah. (MOANING) (TENSE MUSIC) Oh my god. Oh my god! Oh my god, Cody, no! (TENSE, MELANCHOLY MUSIC) WOMAN: What? (laughs) MAN: Oh shit. WOMAN: Oh my god. (PIANO MUSIC) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) (PIANO CHORD PLAYS) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) I'll bring you to enlightenment. (SYNTH POP MUSIC) (CODY MOANING) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) Oh my god. (CODY MOANING) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) That's incredible. (CODY MOANING) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) I'm gonna eat you. (SYNTH POP MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (JENNIFER SOBBING) Mrs. Fields? Mrs. Fields, wake up, it's about Cody. I called a bunch of times, you didn't answer. Wake up, hey. (SOBBING) Are you okay? (SOBBING) What does Cody know? I thought, I thought you were having a seizure. Willis, what did she say? I don't know. I swear. I need to know what she said about her father. She won't tell me. Look, if you know what really happened that night when Mason passed away, then please, level with me. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) My dad killed himself a few months ago. I haven't talked to anyone about it yet. He seemed so happy to me. My mom, me, we all were happy. I mean, I was happy. I thought we were happy. For a time, I guess. If that makes any sense. What's wrong? Don't cry, please. I don't do tears. We're some fucked up pair, aren't we? (CHUCKLES) (SYNTH POP MUSIC) Why are you burning me up with your eyes like that? I really dig this look on you. (CHUCKLES) I can help you reach you father, if you choose. You're not one of those soothsayers, are you? When you're ready, I'll show you. (SYNTH POP MUSIC) CODY: I never thought I could love a woman. I didn't think I could love anyone. But I don't even recognize myself anymore. (SOFT MUSIC) Do you really wanna know? You're standing in the exact spot my husband shot himself in the head. I was in the other room watching TV. Cody was in her bedroom doing her homework. We heard a loud gunshot, the loudest thing I've ever heard. I was walking down the hall, my ears were ringing, and that's when I saw him. And Cody ran past me and she was rubbing him and trying to find his pulse and screaming, and she looked up at me, covered in blood. I knew I shouldn't have asked. (SOFT MUSIC) (TOILET FLUSHES) - (MOANING) - Watch this. (MOANING) WILLIS: No. Turn it off. No. Watch it. WILLIS: I don't wanna see it again, stop. What do you mean again? It's your fault. You made me follow her. - Where is she Willis? - Turn it off. I'll tell you, all right? Turn it the fuck off. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) CODY: What's all this for? I'm not doing another video. It's time. Sit. CODY: I'm sucking anymore dick tonight Diablo. - Drink this. - What's in it? Just some Diablo tears. Now sit, baby. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Give in. Release. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Are you gonna tell me what's going on? I'm serious Diablo. Diablo. This is really uncomfortable. Why are you... If any assholes come over here tonight, I'm done. Just relax. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) You have a lifetime of gunk hovering in your chakra area here. I'm going in to cleanse your system. CODY: What the fuck do you really think you're doing? What's the fuckin' mask for? I'm gonna take you to the astral plane so you an access your Akashic records. Akashic records? The record of emotions, events, and memories. I'm going to lead you while you are blind. The room's spinning. What was in that shit? (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Welcome to the world of psychic surgery, Cody. Welcome to my world of pain. Oh my god, Diablo, that hurts. Why are you doing this? Diablo, stop. I'm bleeding. (SCREAMS) Why are you doing this? Please. Why? DIABLO: Sultan sacrifice, all her. (CODY SOBBING) CODY: Untie me. Ah, you're killing me. Why are you doing this? DIABLO: You need to understand my suffering, Cody Bear. Cody Bear? Only my parents called me that. DIABLO: I know. Boom! Remember? Blood, brains? I'm scared. (SOBBING) Somebody help! (SOBBING) DIABLO: Get that bile out, baby. CODY: Get me to a hospital now. Pay homage to Mason, Cody! How do you know my dad? How do you know his name? DIABLO: Get that bile out. Untie me, now. You're fucking killing me. You're fucking killing me. (SOBBING) JENNIFER: This is it? WILLIS: This is a bad idea, Mrs. Fields. That woman is batshit crazy. CODY: Untie me, now! You're fucking killing me! CODY: Mrs. Fields, slow down, she has a gun. JENNIFER: Get away from her! - Get away from her! - Untie me! Get me out of here! - Jesus, Cody. - She stabbed me, mom. - Willis, do something. - Mom, untie me. - Get me out of here. - Untie her. CODY: Get me out of here. WILLIS: Stay with me Cody, hey. CODY: Get me out of here! Look at me, look at me baby. I'm gonna get you to the hospital. It's okay. Untie her. (SOBBING) Who the fuck are you? What did you do to my daughter? Cody right here, look at me. Cody, look at me. - I can't. - Stay with me Cody. Get the fuck out of my face. (GUN COCKS) Stop, you uncaring bitch! (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'll give you anything you want. What I want, you can't give me. WILLIS: Let's go, we're getting out here. Let's go. Where the fuck are you going? (GUNSHOT) WILLIS: Cody! (SCREAMING) Shit, she shot me. (SCREAMING) (GUNSHOTS) No, mom! Don't shoot her! No, mom! Don't do it. Stop. Don't shoot her! Don't shoot her. (GUNSHOT) (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Diablo. (SOBBING) Get the fuck away from me. Get away from me. (DIABLO GRUNTING) Why'd you stab me? WILLIS: Cody, don't... Please help me. Help me! Come quick. She tried to kill my daughter. Please help me. (COUGHING) Oh my god, it's her. (DIABLO GASPING) CODY: Why did you shoot her? (DIABLO COUGHING) (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) This is it. I'm dying. We had a good run, you and me. I'm finally leaving this shit hole. CODY: Why did you shoot her? You have his scent. Whose, Diablo? WILLIS: Cody, is she talking about your father? I loved him more, Cody Bear. You took him from me. I love you. WILLIS: Cody, she's talking about your dad. JENNIFER: Cody. (GUNSHOT) CODY: Stop. No. Get the fuck. She's the one that ruined our lives, Cody. She did this to us. WILLIS: Mrs. Fields. Don't shoot her! WILLIS: Mrs. Fields, stop. CODY: Don't, not again! WILLIS: Mrs. Fields, don't. (GUNSHOT) (CODY SCREAMS) Diablo. WILLIS: What did you do? What have you done? (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) I love you. Who are you? Where is this coming from? This is totally unfair. I'm doing all I can! I know what you did! What are you talking about? I know you're a fucking fag! Who are you to judge? Oh so now it's my fault? (GUN COCKS) Cody. Cody, what are you doing baby? It's okay. (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) Cody. What are you doing baby? Why, daddy? It's not what you think, Cody Bear. Cody? Cody. Is it because of me? Is it because of me? (GUN COCKS) No Cody, no Cody, no. JENNIFER: Don't, Cody! (GUN CLICKS) MASON: Cody. (SOBBING) (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) (GUNSHOT) Daddy? (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) Daddy. Daddy. (SOBBING) No, no. Daddy. (SOBBING) Mom. Mom. (SOBBING) (SCREAMS) (SOBBING) WILLIS: Hey Cody. Wake up. Hey, wake up. JENNIFER: Cody. - Are you with us? - Cody, wake up. Cody! Oh my god. Cody. Cody, please. Oh my god. You came back. Where did I go? I thought you died. Cody, you were talking to your dad. Where? Where is he? He's not with us anymore honey. Where is he? Don't you remember? (SIRENS WAILING) Cody Bear. What do you remember? Everything. (SIRENS WAILING) I remember everything now. Turns out my mom, Jen, was right. My dad did have an affair with Diablo, and she killed them both. Crazy. Death follows me just like it did with my mom. Well I'm sorry to hear that. Now do you know whether your father was involved with Diablo's operation? Honestly, I don't know. They seemed like an odd pair. And if we were to rewind these clocks right now, there would be a woman that once said that there's one ending to everyone's life and that we all die with our bare hands. (LAUGHS) Well that's really unfortunate because that's not how it worked out for her, is it? You and your mother killed her. Okay. See these stitches right here? She stabbed me two times and then drugged me. That should answer a lot of your questions. Is that why you killed her? I have something for you. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) It will show you everything you need to know, it'll prove that I'm innocent. It proves everything. I knew you'd come around, Cody. See, you might get yourself out of this after all. You know what I don't understand, is you are a smart girl. How is that you got yourself involved with this woman? I ask myself that question a lot, and I lost everything when I lost my dad. And if you're curious, my dad didn't commit suicide, didn't kill himself. My mom shot him, in cold blood. So, I'm not the person you need to be interrogating right now, and she should be behind bars. I'll look into that for you. You did good, Cody. And I do hope that you, um, I hope that you get the help that you need. You and me both. Now there's one last thing that we need to discuss, and that's your father. She's gonna get what she deserves. (CODY CHUCKLES) Yeah, for the both of us. (TENSE, DRAMATIC MUSIC) (INSECTS BUZZING) I tried to spread my dad's ashes today, but, couldn't find myself to do it. He's all I have left. Hey. Where'd you go? I just couldn't let him go yet. I feel close to him with this. My mom, whoa, it's so weird calling her that, Jen, she sent me another letter this week. You miss her? Not really. Is that weird? It's a process, Cody. I've heard that before. (WILLIS CHUCKLES) She's where she belongs. (TRACKS RATTLING) It's never gonna stop hurting, Cody, but, you're not alone. I know. ANNOUNCER: This train's final destination is... One day this will be us. We'll all be ashes some day. (CHUCKLES) Just not yet. You know my dad told me if I have one friend in life, then I'm doing something right. You know, Willis has always been there for me. He's the best friend I could ever ask for, so yeah, my life is going pretty good now. I'm ready for the future. (TENSE SYNTH MUSIC) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)
