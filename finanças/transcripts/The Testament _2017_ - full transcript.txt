Continuing the appeal against the building project in Lensdorf, where according to the claimant, there is a mass grave in which some 200 Jews are buried. How many excavations were conducted in the area? Twenty-one. And nothing has been found? The area in question has been excavated, but the mass grave has yet to be found. It's a very large area, it's hard to cover so much ground. Yes, appendix 32. In one testimony, a woman claims that she heard Jews screaming in front of her window. In this area. Another one claimed that he saw a, uh, truck, carrying Jews stop in this area here. Perhaps the historian would like to tell us where he wants construction halted. In this area, or in that, or, perhaps the entire town. We ask that the freeze on the construction remains in effect until the grave is found. With all due respect, this town needs to grow, and we have to step into the future and not linger in the past. The victims should not pay for our inability to find the grave so far. And so shouldn't the citizens of our town. If it is not stopped, the entire area will be covered with cement, and the graves will never be found. Sir, the Austrian Ministry of Interior doesn't have the authority to delay the development any longer. If new evidence comes to light within the next seven days, we'll be happy to examine it. No appeal will be accepted after that time. I'll speak to you in German, and you can answer me in English, OK? In that case, I'll answer in Hebrew. I would like to open our second session on the matter of the development in Lensdorf. Thank you. We've received no new evidence? That's correct. I understand you're negotiating an agreement. Yes, we are. We believe we have the new evidence. Is this an assumption or a fact? Fact. And why haven't you submitted it? These are classified testimonies. We need to work it out with the survivors. This is unacceptable, sir. You can't keep us waiting if you haven't submitted any new evidence. Yoel... We would like to reexamine our agreement, since we got some new facts. According to the law, you don't have the authority to require an immediate submission of the classified documents. Even if acting under the Hague Convention, you must submit a special request to see classified documents. When will you submit all the new evidence? In two weeks. Are you aware of the fact that if it turns out that you do not have the required evidence, the other party's entitled to press charges? We cannot accept... Yes... I give you one week to submit all new evidence. This meeting is adjourned. Hello? - Mr. Burm? - Yes? I'm Simon Falcon's daughter. You know him? Um... no. I saw you in my father's funeral. Remember? No. Mr. Burm, you are the only person that knew him from the war. Can I ask you a question? What do you want? Were you with him in Lensdorf? Yes. Guten morgen. Good morning. I understand the parties have finally reached an agreement. Madame, I want to point out that the agreement we've reached is based on the Austrian's official recognition of the Lensdorf Massacre. We certainly acknowledge the possibility that an atrocious massacre of that kind could've taken place. Yoel? Madame... I have the evidence needed to confirm the exact location of the massacre. And who are you, sir? Dr. Halberstam. Oh... Excuse me, I didn't recognize you. These are the names of the Jews who were massacred in Lensdorf. These people were sent from Koszeg to Lensdorf on the 24th of March, 1945. After that, all trace of them was lost. This testifies to the identity of the victims. It is signed by Podezin, the local Gestapo officer. What is the source of the document? This document was found in a prayer book given to me by this survivor. This Kluger was sent to dig a mass grave and stole various documents that Podezin intended to burn. The Russian forces were only 10 kilometers away, and Podezin wanted to cover the massacre. He picked a group of 10 men out of the Jewish forced labor in Lensdorf, they were sent to dig a mass grave in the forest, north of the church. Aryeh Kluger, Josef Heller, and Herman Burm were in that group. What about the bones in the southern field? The victims were not buried in the southern field. Once the massacre was over in the forest, these 10 men were sent to cover the corpses. That's when Burm and Heller escaped. The remaining eight were taken to the southern field, where they were murdered. The Nazi's hardly bothered to cover the bodies. Those were the eight bodies the Russian investigator testifies to in appendix B. And that's why we could not find the 200 there. The question remains, where is the mass grave? We know you didn't find it. These are all false allegations. Madame... this is the southern field. This is the location of the mass grave. Mr. Burm knew that the grave was located 1,247 steps north of the church. What he didn't know that the church was bombed at the end of the war and rebuilt in a different location. We've been digging in the wrong place. This... is the grave's actual location. I will review your claims and reach a decision. This meeting is adjourned.
