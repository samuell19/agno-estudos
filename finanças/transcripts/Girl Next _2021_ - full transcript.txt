Stop! Stop. Stop, I'll do it. Please, I'll obey. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just give me another chance. I'll do what you ask. Please. I'm sorry! Sorry, I'll do better, please! Get... let me go, get off of me! No! Get in. Sofia, you look completely lovely this afternoon. Absolutely perfect. Now purse your lips. That's it, just purse your lips. Now, do you want to please your man? Yes? Do anything he wants you to do. You'll suck his cock daily. Anything. Good. No, no! Don't fight back. Don't fight back, Lorian. How do you know my name? You have women here? There's a cost for everything beautiful. Do you understand? No. No. No, no, don't, don't. There you go. Good. Now be still. Look at that. The best America has to offer. Blonde and blue eyes. The FÃ¼hrer would be so proud. We had to make up for our Heinrich's indulgence. We couldn't help it though. It's always your fault. Do you understand? Wait. Wait. You're such a disappointment, Misha. You're quite stupid, aren't you? I got her, like you wanted, and she's beautiful! Even more than the others. Beauty is a gift you do not possess. You could have. It's too late now. And if you keep sampling the merchandise, you'll diminish it. I didn't touch her. women that weren't like you. Look at you with your ugly hair and your clown makeup. You call yourself a woman? And yet you make the girls up very nicely, but you do nothing with yourself just to piss me off. Why did you marry me then? Just get our next Sofia ready. It's no longer the same. And they can't possibly understand what that means. But they will. Hello? Can you hear me? Fuck! Well, aren't you the picture of beauty today, Lorian West? Hmm? Except that's an unfortunate injury. Let me have a look. It's probably just a light sprain. Please let me go. This place is full of dangers. A person could easily hurt themselves falling on a rusty rake or pushing too hard against a balcony. This is just a temporary place for us, a waystation... of sorts. For you, perhaps a crossroads. Are you going to kill me? Of course not. A slight sprain. You won't be able to run away, but you'll be fine. I think you know my wife Misha already. Let's get some ice on it. You're, uh... You're different. We will punish you. You don't seem to understand. You traffic women. We create beauty, and we follow a very high standard, including the selection process. Only when the change is complete do we deliver. A change? Being curious won't help you. Being obedient will. Who are you? Mm, no one. No, no, no. Wait. Wait! I'll survive it and attain what you have! You have no idea. Aqua Velva. You have eaten from the tree. Now you will be as we. My success is inevitable. Oh my God! You know, it's up to Heinrich about letting you live and selling you to a client. At least you're not like the others. I have to go back. Look up Revelation 18. I'm not... I'm not really a Bible person. Can you get me the keys to the car? I'm not really of my own free will, or else I would... I would kill them both. Who controls you? Look, he's gonna... he's gonna come in here and try to change you. You just gotta go along, you play the game. You aren't who you think you are. I know that's hard to understand. You're the opposition. I see things. I see you getting out of here, and that is a one-time opportunity. Well, well, well. Isn't this nice? You! Out now! Now! You, look at me. Look at me. You stay put, or next time it's your foot. Do you understand? Out! Get the fuck out! You just hate beautiful women. You are to stay out of sight and not mess with her. That's 300K in there, now maybe docked to 275 because of that toe. Which you, Misha, cut off. You did, by breaking the rules. The rules? We have rules now? You know what you should do? You should write them out and then post them on the internet. You cold, miserable bitch! I am a happily married woman. Then, uh, why does Daddy like fucking me more than he likes fucking you? You're lying. You want me to comfort you? It's all in your head. They track you. You're becoming them. Legion. Why did you cut off my toe? Ow! Stop. Honey, you need to do exactly what you're told if you want to live. There's two ways this goes: one, you're in a private jet looking all pretty, or two, you're pig food, or three, there's always three. So you should do everything you can to protect me. I can't promise anything anymore. Heinrich is quite something. Dark, bad boy, with that sort of... cosmopolitan trashy charm. Sophisticated. That just reels you in. You can't resist, you know? The dark power. Ah-ah-ah. Don't harm the merchandise. You're not like the others. But let me tell you something. You won't even remember your own face when this is all over. Costin' me money. Look, I don't know and I don't care what kinda spooky shit you got goin' on out here, but we need product, you understand? Well, this is not an exact science. There's a spiritual dimension as well. Sometimes they... they just don't make it. Hmm, well, we're very happy with the work so far, so... here's a gift. The Holy Grail. Which we lovingly call Aqua Velva, one of the greatest quantum breakthroughs of the last 200 years. Nobody makes dolls like you, Heinrich. I know. - That shit cracks you up. - I know. I'm gonna go upstairs, dip the old wick, as they say. You just don't understand what I really am. Ow. Sorry. I told him not to, but he don't much listen to me. Help me please. You are very... very nice. Let me go, okay? I'll cooperate, just... - My boyfriend, he's... - Yeah, your boyfriend. Jeff Blake? - Can you call him? - Sure. You know he's the one who set you up, right? Oh, yeah, I mean, without him, we wouldn't even know about you. I can't believe that. Mm-hmm. Come on, look at you. Why do you think he was with you? It sure must hurt, huh? Detective Hennigan's on the case. And your parents? They just hired my buddy, Shawn James, best damn P.I. in the state, when good old Jeff, your trusty boyfriend reported you missin'. Oh... they all report to me. Well, see, I ain't just a sheriff. It's girls like you they want these days, Lori. All-American beauty and brains. Industry's really changin'. So you won't mind me. They'll be fucking you... over... ...and over and over. And you'll like it eventually. I just hope you don't get some psycho who's into chainsaws and shit. Oh, man. No blue pill necessary. That toe. Oh, it was a mistake. - It might cost us. - That's all you care about? I ain't gonna hurt you... much. Get off! Goddamn bitch! Fuck! Time for you to become a lovely woman. You pull some shit like you did with Maddox earlier, and I'm gonna gut you like a pig. Open your eyes, Sofia. Open your eyes. Now, you were given a mind-expanding substance along with something else to subdue you for long enough for this to take hold. You might call it a date-rape drug. Now, what color am I holding up? Blue. Blue, very good, perfect. Now you'll become my doll. Show me the way, You're a doll. Hmm? Play with yourself. I know. I know, I know. You are Sofia. I want you, Heinrich. But you must be prescient as well. We can work on that. Heinrich? Lorian, you're beginning to anticipate my needs. Who do I rule over? Are you chosen? Maybe this time you'll do what we ask, but if you do not comply, you know. I know that look. You are the power. Rule over me. Well! - Oh, yeah! - The latest Sofia. Mmm. Heinrich, you're a goddamn genius. Yes, well, the price has gone up. Unfortunately, the cost of materials is skyrocketing. You're short this month. Yes, I know, I can explain... The AV is screwing with your brain, your judgment. We needed two this month. Now one's feral, another one's dead. - Yes, I can explain that. - Don't even try. How did you know... ...that one is dead? And they thought the Aqua Velva was gonna enhance your work. Don't worry, you'll meet your quota. You know that I spent my whole life in the program. The reason I left is because there's no creativity anymore. It's just meddling. These dumb-fuck bureaucrats run the world now. Well, that's why you're here and they're not. Take your time. Thank you, because I was beginning to think that you were all about quantity over quality. The client's extremely pleased, so fuck you, Heinrich, you win. More money! Simpleton. It's not too late. Don't stay there. You need me? You're still here. Tell me about, uh, your life. You have a boyfriend? Where do you work? What makes you happy? Your hands are warm. We can help each other. I was, uh... I wanted to be successful. My parents were racists. I don't think that now. When I was a little girl, I had a pet hamster. My brother killed it. Her. Sadie. I had no idea what that meant. Heinrich is under their control. I think he loves me. We can help each other. You're my friend. I'm not really anything. Anything? All right, last one. Don't go where they want you to go. Look at me. Look at me! My life, my joke life, isn't... wasn't... real anyway. None of it ever has been. It's really your joke. I'm your sick joke. I'm not going back. I can't be programmed. Even if I get out of here, I am not going back. Everything is fake. A box within a box within a box. A game. It's so much easier than real life. In a way. So, we're talking to our guest, Lorian West, about her time as a travel editor at the Denver Post. Not me. Going to work. Having a boyfriend. Going to a political rally. Going to a party. Cruise. A vacation. Selling them all. Plotting your way into the winner's circle. So? So, bend or break. Okay, so what do you mean? Perfect. Break this. They program you to accept, but they have no idea that they are a program of a program. They programmed me before they took me. I'm a program clone. I'm not going back. This is the key. Pure DMT and a mix of other hallucinogens beyond what a human can possibly process. Now we'll complete the treatment. Do you know that I developed this technique over 20 years ago? It's extraordinary. Legion. Legion. The time will come. Well done. You think so? Yes, I think we're ready for the grand finale. What if she fails? Why this sudden concern? I don't want to die. But you do. Now! Here, Misha. You can't practice enough. Go! There, you wanna try? Now! Don't worry, don't think, just anticipate. Okay? Try again. Go! Now, Sofia... Put the barrel in your mouth. Sofia, place the barrel in your mouth. I told you. Now pull the trigger. Did you put the word out, Misha? I did. One must sacrifice the innocent to save the. Beautiful. Sometimes, we must kill what we love. That's it. You know, there's more to the vetting process than we let on. But you thought I just sold all my dolls to some foreign customers. I'm dizzy. I'm very selective and very successful. I almost don't want to let you go. I think you should come with us to Switzerland. It's beautiful this time of year and I think it would be wonderful for you. Priceless. You're so special. It doesn't work on you, does it? Fucking bitch! You ruined everything. You fucking ruined everything! You like it, don't you? Huh? Does it make you happy, huh? Shit. Yeah? Yeah, yeah, I'm almost there, man, goddamn. I'll be there soon. Yeah. See y'all there. Woo! Woo! Beer? Hell yeah! All right, woo! I want some pussy! Yeah? Oh, shit! How you doing there, Billy? You ready now? Ooh, I never been so ready. Let's go. I guess I'll leave you two alone now. Here I come, baby. Oh, you're so beautiful... W-What the fuck? It's quite all right, just relax. Who the fuck are you? Ah, ladies. Now, Sofia. Let's see what you think of this situation. This... man is about to fuck a corpse. A dead body. Is that sick or what? Hm? Unfortunately, for organ harvesting, this one is out. Is this acceptable to you, Sofia? That this pig-man would fuck a dead body? Shoot this piece of shit twice. In the face. Hey, I paid by credit card. Yes, we're very grateful. You think you can just shoot me and get away with it? Clients, they know where I am! Dumb shits! You'll pay. Somehow, I don't think so. Hey, you! Shit-for-brains! Do you need help? Hm? You should be playing. Daddy. I've been bad. What? Well, welcome. How lovely you look this evening. - Thank you for inviting me. - My pleasure. Well, drink? To you, dear one. You've certainly shown me something. You're indeed superior in a manner of speaking, and I have an announcement to make. You, Lorian, are not a true Sofia. No, don't be disappointed. There's far more to do. To a prosperous future. Things are looking up. You're very handsome tonight. Thank you. What is this? Say hello to Lorian. Please. Wow. Oh! I'll have some of that. Mmm. Yucky. You just think you're so smart, making the live sex toys for the erectile dysfunction set. You're a throwback to an antiquated science, a dumb, brute force used during World War II. Trauma creates more trauma. It's not just manipulation of personality and mental cognition, behavioral modification and predictive programming. Splitting off opens for the other side to infiltrate, and fail, as they always do! Dissociation and reprogramming. The future grid is nanodigitization of the freaking universe! Time and space. Mass consciousness as the weapon of choice, game theory at the molecular point, at the biodigital... nexus point. You guys get it? It's called... it's called technology! It's macro now, not micro, uh-uh. That's where the real money is, you know? Like, money? Money, money? What? Did you think they were gonna pay you for a new Sofia? That's funny. You're just their little... their little pet. Like a little kitty-kat. We are leaving now. Lorian, you're coming with me. Gimme the fucking smart keys, and yes, I do know what I mean, so stuff that forlorn look up your tiny ass, sweetie pie. Your generation just doesn't understand quality. Or making things the right way, the real way. Step by step, by hand. Keys! Now. Smart keys. You bitch! Fuck! - Fuck. - What? You don't know anything all of a sudden? Uggh! Smart key. You have no fucking idea how much damage - you have caused. - I'm sure that you have added it all up and calculated to the penny, right? Thank you! Let's go. Motherfucker! Whiny. We could have sold her. But no, no, no, no, no, you had to interfere. Interfere with his brilliance, with his process. You hurt us. Us? Us? There is no us for you! All right, don't hurt her too much, Misha. Stop, Misha! Why do you always have to protect Charlotte? It's about time you realized that your precious Lorian is a failure and now we have to find her. I'm sure Maddox has her already. Happy now? Hey, baby! How you doin' this evening? Hey. You okay, honey? Hey! You okay? Obviously, she's not okay. Hey, Candy? Shit. Everything and everyone is alive and they want me to help them. We need another 300K for this next phase. And transportation. Next week, they say. We don't have until next week! Fucker! Fucking stop it! We'll be in business before this evening, just up your game. Why don't you love me? I picked you up when you were in a ridiculous punk band going nowhere. I just wish Charlotte was dead. Don't you ever say that again. She's supportive of you? Your loyal one? Without us, she would die. Charlotte also designed this program. Now, somehow, she's deviated, regressed, but she was top in her class at MIT in theoretical physics before I got her a real job. Now, her theories never really panned out, she doesn't have any bragging rights, but do not fuck with her. She's very vindictive. Yeah. No, she's a masochist and a murderer. She produces nothing. She helps nothing. And she will eventually kill us. And if you can't see that, then you're not a good judge of character. There are worse things. Better than that big lion upstairs, hey? What happened to us, huh? with us? We were gonna travel the world and live a good life. You just witnessed a tiny measure of what I can do. Did you see that? Did you see that? Simple question, bubblehead. Now, I told you. I don't like highlights, right? You knew this. You failed to fix it. I want Lorian fully bleached. You know what our client wants, so why are you trying to destroy this operation? That shit is killing you. This is the future, you idiot! I'm the way forward, me, they chose me! Always up front, not you want-to-bes, hm? We have a dream team here. Charlotte will soon see the light, and we'll make so much money, it'll blow your tiny fucking mind. Here. Have your subhuman shit! Knock yourself out! And some of us are true pioneers. And fix Lorian's foot. I'm sick of your feeble attempts at control. He doesn't see in you what I see. Sit with me? Ah, shit! I thought you were completely changed. I don't know who the fuck you are anymore. I should just fucking kill you. Lorian? Sofia? What the... Who the fuck talking to? They just decided to kill you. Why are you helping me? I am cooperating with the enemy because sometimes you have to, to survive. You'll understand one day. Don't worry, Lorian. I'll finish the work. I am a lion. You are whatever we want you to be. TouchÃ©, bitch. We are everywhere. There is no escape. Never listen to the dead. Even if I get out of this place, I'm not going back. They made me then, too. They cloned me from a clone of a clone. Shh! The world is a simulation. There is no other explanation. I was chosen, but I am not one of them. I know. I know everything now. Congratulations. You're my finest creation. Now she will do anything and everything we ask in a far superior manner to the average Sofia. Because she's free. I'm no longer subject to the whims of. I've gained no credit for what I've achieved! This little monument is for the infantile. The challenged, the mentally impaired! They can't stop what has been set in motion. Motion is a change of position between objects within a given interval of time. But without time, T, motion is unnecessary. I'm everywhere by simultaneously , you miserable bastard. I don't know where he is. Just listen. They're pulling the operation. Don't ask me why. Oh, fuck! You have to kill Lorian. I'll deal with Heinrich. Those motherfuckers. They used him. They used us. Some kind of half-assed experiment. Of course. They drew the data from the Sofias, and then mapped the progression and probably planted Lorian as a marker. And then, of course, all the data from the Aqua Velva, which is the real reason for this whole thing. Fuck. I hate those bastards. Well, we're pulling out. You kill Lorian, I'll get back to you. You have to let her go. You know that it's a balance, and sometimes, you have to give one back in order to survive. She is the key. No. You just chose the wrong girl. They've known ever since they dropped her off. We have been under their microscope ever since. Lies! They want me to succeed. This can be a total success. She's already broken through. It's over. Let her go. There's something you need to understand. If you think I'm inferior to you because of that... Love me. I see. Is it okay? Gonna fuck you up, bitch! Lorian will destroy you. Lorian! This is your quantum moment. Charlotte doesn't believe that I can transmute reality, but I just did! And you can feel it. Pulling you. Do you understand now? There are two worlds. I'm sure Maddox has her already. There you are, you little bitch. Gonna get some! Goddamn! Bitch! You need a doctor. Maddox hasn't called yet. I can't reach him. What's wrong with having a little fun? You need to go to the hospital. Just stitch me up, s'il vous plaÃ®t. Does it hurt? I feel nothing. I just want to fuck. Actually, I just want to think. I just want to breathe, I just want to be. But there is a proviso. Not in a line, not in a series. I'm so tired of a series of things. Do you realize that's all your fault, Misha? You always think in a series about everything, and you forced everyone else around you to think in the same way. Yeah, well, somebody needs to figure out the next fucking step, and it's obviously not you. - Well, there you go again. - You need me. I need... ...a sign. It's Maddox. Shit! Let's go. You think you can take me? So far, you've done nothing! You silly lion! There's a whole world you know nothing about! I am the future. It's just the beginning. I am so sorry, dear brother. Oh. He was really your brother? I thought that was a game. I can't breathe. You broke him, and I knew you would. That is why I wanted you to leave. My brother was a master of this world. You coulda fooled me. You are not one of us, so I tried to give you back, as a gesture of goodwill to allow us to continue unabated. So you're the real mastermind behind this wonderful humanitarian service. You fooled everyone. Even your pathetic brother and his abuse-victim wife. I wanted you to kill Misha. She was never good for him, bad blood. But you couldn't even do that. So you had your chances. It was all in plain sight, Lorian. You just couldn't see it. They're all dead now. As are you. Now. We have to go very slowly here, Lorian. That's good. My. Who taught you that? Me! You're just not good enough though. Bitch! You should have read your own book. I know it by heart. On target. Hi. Lorian West here, of Lionheart Self Defense School. Women are prey for traffickers today and need to know how to defend themselves. The truth is, the kidnapping and the sex trafficking of young to middle-aged women is a real danger, even in upscale malls and supermarket parking lots. I teach you how to defeat any attacker. You know what I mean. Get some help. Call me before it's too late. Even if I get out of this place, I'm not going back. They made me then too. They cloned me from a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone. The world is a simulation. There is no other explanation. I was chosen. But I am not one of them. I know. I know everything now. I know everything now... I know everything now. You have eaten from the tree. Now you will be as we.
