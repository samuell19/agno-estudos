Subtitles by explosiveskull Hey. Have you seen Nancy Drew? Nancy who? Never mind. Thank you. Mrs. Shay! - Hey, have you seen Nancy Drew? - No. Thank you. Sorry, sir! I'm sorry. Sorry. Watch where you're going, kid. Hey! Have you seen Nancy Drew? Drew! Finally! You didn't answer your phone. Sorry, I don't hear it when I'm skating. Check it out. I can't believe anyone would do this to Bess, and now it's gone viral. You know how sensitive Bess is, she won't leave the house now. Please, guys. Go away. We're not leaving! Great. I'm so pathetic, my friends have to come and rescue me. I'm an even bigger loser than I thought. Okay, if... If needing your friends means you're a loser, then I'm the biggest loser of all. 'Cause, you guys make me forget I live in this one-horse town every day. - Jeez. - Hey. Hi. Actually, River Heights has four horses. Sorry. Let me in. Welcome to the party! Let's school this troll. But, we don't even know who did it. Oh, isn't it obvious? Oh, he's just a dill weed. Can I show you? I'm so stupid. I forgot to take my goggles off. Oh, stop it. The last thing you are, is stupid. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. My clothes might not be as good as everyone else's, but they're not dirty. Hey, it looks like a two-year-old came up with this. Wish I could fast-forward it. Just... Don't look it for a second. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Everyone saw this. Don't pay attention to what a lizard-brain does. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. Dirty Bess. There! Someone forgot to blur out his reflection. - Presenting... - Number 91. Try that again. It's... It's a reflection. Nineteen. Derek freaking Barnes. - God. - Should've known. Derek is making fun of me all the time. I know I'm not cute, or cool, but... Why can't he just let me be? What? You're super cute. Aw! Don't they make a darling couple? The idiot spawn of the two richest families in town. Nancy Drew, I know that look. You can't just go after Derek. I'm not gonna go after Derek. I'm just gonna help him see the light. - Good luck with that. - Yeah. You've only spent summers here. You don't really know Derek like we do. But, if we don't stop him, he'll just do it again to someone else. Do you guys really want that on your conscience? Okay. I'm in. Fine. Great! Let's hit the gym. Wait. You... You wanna work out? Like, now? No, but in order to get ready for football season he's gotta super-set. You know, all the time. And... Here. From the timestamp, it looks like mid-morning Tuesday is his favorite time to hog the floor. That means he'd shower around, you know, 11:45, so he could be fresh to play trainer for the cheerleading squad. What? The way your brain works is so cool. You know, psychologists say it's okay for bullies to get a little taste of their own medicine. It's called restorative justice. Ahhh! Ahhh! Yeah. Yes! What's the most important thing in Derek's life? His social media presence, right? Let's make a tiny adjustment to that. Gold! Gold! Gold, gold, gold, gold! Bess. Bess, this is perfect! This is perfect! Okay. Twenty seconds. Yes! - Oh, boy. Oh, boy. - Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Get up here. I did something. Oh, my God. That was so... Okay. - I've got everything setup. - ...so close. We're ready to go. - Maple bars, anyone? - Yes! Can I, please? Oh, my God! Maple bars are my thing! Dig in. Oh, I probably shouldn't. My skin is still breaking out. Eat a donut, Bess. Okay? Life is short, go. - Come on. - We'll share. So, how long will it take? I don't know. Hey, this is my set, not hers! My bad. I'm all yours now. Derek! Are you okay? Never better. No. Something is seriously wrong with you, dude. Look. Derek Barnes, welcome to Thunderdome! When you humiliate others, - there will be consequences. - Stop laughing at me! She's checking me out. She's checking me out. I look good. She still looking? Faster. At least I'm trying. I'm currently single right now if you guys are looking for anything. You can chill at my house if you guys are interested. Just make sure you keep your face below my back, so, like, my face is the only thing. Because, like, if your face is on my video, it's gonna be ruined. I'm just waiting on the machine. Stop laughing at me. Okay? Stop laughing at me. - He's so blue. - Oh, my God! This stuff actually works. I was not expecting that. That... It works! - It works! Let's get outta here. - Phew! Nobody's ever stood up for me like that before. You stood up for yourself. No, we just added a little color. - Aw. - Thank you. Of course! Aww! You guys are the best. This town is so much more fun with you in it, Nancy. Even if that means we... get in a lot more trouble. Oh, come on. Just a little trouble. Your daughter assaulted my son. That's more than enough for me to sue. Go right ahead. All my daughter did was defend a young girl your son cyberbullied. My son did no such thing. How about we look at the video that Derek posted from your IP address? - This is ridiculous. - Guys, let's all calm down a minute. Under State Penal Code 646.9, cyberbullying is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and $1,000 in fines, and that's just for you, Jeff. This is not over, Counselor. I promise that. Are you sure Jeff Barnes is the type of person you want to have as an enemy? I think I can handle him. I'm sorry about all this. I'll make sure Nancy pays for the damages. That's not gonna be enough, though. This is not her first offense, and she involved two other girls. I can't just turn a blind eye. She has to face the consequences this time. What did you have in mind? Eight hours a day? Okay, for the next two months, basically my whole summer just went sideways. I'm surprised that's all the community service you got. You committed several felonies. Hey, they're only felonies if you're 18. Oh, excellent point, Counselor. And, since you're nowhere near 18, you are hereby grounded. I stood up to a bully. I mean, why should I get punished for that? I'm proud of you. But the way you did it isn't right. You stooped to his level. You pulled a prank that caused thousands of dollars worth of damage. They may have to re-tile the entire shower. But worst of all, you involved other girls. I mean, that dye wears off. And delivering justice isn't a prank, it's my duty. So, is it like last week? - It was your duty to burn the word "assassin..." - Okay, no. - ...into Mr. Blankenship's lawn. - He was shooting crows, Dad. That's murder. If you think that driving everybody in town crazy is gonna sabotage things so bad for us we have to move back to Chicago, you're wrong. - We had a deal. - We never made a deal. You know, a deal is when two people come to an agreement. You made the decision. I mean, you never gave me a real choice. I wanted to stay in Chicago with all my friends. I never wanted to move here. I couldn't stay there and you know that. Knowing everything about the city reminded me of your mom. Yeah, well, maybe I don't wanna forget her. Thank you very much. Vote for the train. Let's bring some new blood to this town. A little culture, maybe a Chipotle, huh? You get a burrito. You get a burrito. You get a burrito. Where's my burrito? Vote for the train, and you'll get one. There she is, straight from the hoosegow. I got your skateboard there, sweetheart. Okay. - Listen, Nancy. - Give her some space, Cars. Support your local business. Vote for the train. Here, have a slice. Maybe you'll come to your senses and vote for the train, too. Really? Not the time. Train won't make anyone wanna visit this delightful dump anyway. Hey, River Heights isn't a dump. Well, it will be if this train comes through here. Listen, I'm fighting for what makes this town special. The charm of it, the community. I mean, do you have any idea how many historical homes will be knocked to the ground? Oh, my darling brother, the train will finally bring us into the correct century. Grandpa here wants to keep using the Stone Ages. And look, Nancy thinks you're mental if you find this place charming. Hello, Hannah. I'm right here. This town needs something fresh to shake things up, you know? Give it a little bad element. - An edge, right? - You see what she's doing? See, your aunt didn't make it in New York, and now she thinks she can bring all that and her stand-up career here, too. Hey, I opened for Amy Schumer, you know? Oh! It was a door, but still. See? - That was good, you laughed, right? - That was all right. Yeah. I could be a big fish in a smaller pond, - fill seats at open-mic night. - Hey. How you doing, Nate? Just because more people come to see your stand-up routine doesn't mean the jokes will actually be funny. Wow, Dad. I didn't know you had it in you. Oh, sure. Take my pie and my dreams. And besides, jailbird, I thought you were on my side. Well, this is between you two, not me. Okay. I hate to break up a good family feud, but it's time we go show people like your misguided sister here how wrong they are. Hmm? I'm charging you for that pie, Nate. Hey, I'm just doing my part to keep my favorite family together. You guys are all I've got. Plus, your dad here is the best lawyer this town's ever seen. Ew! God, get a room. Hey, listen, before your dad got here, this train was a sure thing. Now, not! That's how persuasive this guy is. Yeah, yeah. All right. Let's go. All right, here you go. All right, my brother from another mother, let's go rock this town hall meeting. All right. I'd tell you to break a leg, but... - But you'd actually mean it. - Yeah, exactly. Hey, listen. I know your dad's a big pain in the butt, but he does respect you. Yeah, if he respected me, I wouldn't be here. Come here. Sit with me. There are no words for what happened to you. I can't even begin to know how you must feel. Losing your mom. But, think about your dad. I mean, he lost the love of his life. Living in Chicago was killing him. He was turning into the living dead, and he didn't want to be that for you. I never really thought of it that way. And this place isn't half as bad as you think it is. Oh... It kinda totally is. But, you know, present company excluded, of course. Having you here is so cool. The house is alive again. And I know this place is square and a little backwards but it's nothing us cool girls can't do something about. I wish I were half as brave as you. You're as persuasive as your dad, and as righteous as your mom was. Those are superpowers, you know. If you use them for good, imagine who you could be. I thought I did. Yeah, I'm just tired of everyone looking at me, you know? They're all gonna be working for you someday. Don't worry about it. Hey, hey. Back in the car. Back in the car. What is your problem? Your daddy better get with the times and let that train come to town. A lot of powerful people stand to lose a lot of money if your daddy has his way. And I promise you, they will not let that happen. Let go of me! Now, I'm not a violent man, but I will hurt people if I have to. I'm calling the cops. Cops care about delinquents? Do me a favor, tell your daddy that Willie Wharton said to get on board or get out of the way. He tried to run you down? I'm gonna kill this guy. Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? You don't even know, do you? You're worse than Nancy. Yeah, well, still right here. That's just what we need is two Drews arrested on the same day. Hey, maybe we could have matching handcuffs. Listen, I've heard of this guy, Wharton. He's trouble. Got fired from the factory, gets fired from jobs all the time. - You know Tammy Drucker? - Uh-huh. He used to date her. I'm gonna call her. Come on, Dad. This is like the most exciting thing that's happened since we moved here. He's not getting away with what he did. I promise you that. Okay. I think blue really is his color. It was Mom's favorite. Thought it was a nice touch. Oh! Welcome, convicts. Let's make this as pleasant as possible. So first, the area you want to hit today is over here. Pretty dirty area. Nancy, you know you can't have that here. No, I was just gonna play some music. Get me and this here felon in a trash picking mood. This is community service, not a rave. Oh, come on. I'll let you choose the playlist. Hmm? All right. No boy bands. And please, no country. But my lights exploded. A ghost moved my furniture. How can you explain that? I'm telling you, my house is haunted. I don't know what to tell you, ladies. I don't do haunted houses. Sheriff, I have known this woman my entire life. And she doesn't scare easily, and she doesn't lie. So, can't you just send someone out? Are you sure she isn't drinking her own special batch of Kool-Aid? Young man, young man. I have stared down Communism. My choice of a cocktail in retirement is none of your business. Um... Sheriff? Aren't we supposed to respect our elders? Says the delinquent picking up trash. No, actually I'm doing this because I disrespected my peers. I'm sorry, ladies, but I can't spare my one and only deputy for your situation. Yeah, 'cause River Heights is such a hotbed of criminal activity. Keep it up, you're gonna be picking up trash until Christmas. Afternoon, ladies. If you need anything, just give us a call. - Really? - Wow. We gave you a call. Remember? You shouldn't have to handle this all by yourselves, I mean... maybe I can help. No, it's fine. We can deal with it. Now, if you could you wouldn't have gone to the cops. Helen, just a minute. She looks like a very sweet girl. - I love your vest. - Thank you. Trust me, we don't want her help. She's the one who made that horrible video of Derek and she thinks she can do whatever she wants just 'cause her mother died. That was you? Um... Yeah. I think you and I are gonna get along just fine. Come here, you. Uh, Nancy? Where do you think you're going? Oh, I'm taking my 15. What 15? The legend dates back to 1885, when the Colfax brothers, who build Twin Elms, Malcolm and Schuyler, had a falling out over a woman, Millicent Andrews. Malcolm had proposed to her. She wasn't too jazzed up about being, you know, married to the number one pig farmer in town. Plus, she was hopelessly in love with his brother, Schuyler. Oh, boy. Legend it has it, Malcolm killed them both in a fit of jealousy, buried them in the walls. Then, he offed himself. Did they ever find the bodies? No. But when I listen very carefully, I think I can hear them crying. You've gotta be kidding me. I would never kid about a thing like the Colfax ghosts. Stop pretend like you care about any of this. Well, I don't have to pretend. She had me at "people buried in the walls." You just want to get outta community service, which you deserve. Okay. First of all, Helen, I can't get outta community service. I already tried. And, second of all, aren't you curious whether or not the Colfax ghosts are back for revenge? Oh, my! What? You two remind me of when I was young. But we had better hair back in those days. My best friend and I, Rosie, we despised each other. We even fought once over the same boy... Chad, Peter... I don't know. There were so many of 'em. We both dated him, then he jilted both of us. We became best friends. Sadly, Rosie moved to Miami. She loves a man in a Speedo. It just goes to show you that sometimes a girl can find her best friend in her worst enemy. Huh? Huh? - Yeah, no... - No, sorry. Hard pass. Hi! Perfect timing. I made dinner. - What did you do now? - Nothing. I mean, uh, today has been incident-free. It's kind of hard to get in trouble when you're working on a chain gang. So... Yeah. - Besides that... Look! - Mmm-hmm. - Get right in it. Yeah. - Okay. - Sit right here. Don't trip. - All right. Tonight, you'll be eating chicken cacciatore with twice baked potatoes and... And what are you gonna... What did you do this time? Seriously, what's going on? Okay, so you know, I know I'm grounded and all... - Mmm-hmm. - But, maybe you'll let me help a nice lady end her haunted house problem tomorrow night. - Please? - I don't know, Nancy. I got... I'm getting ready to go outta town this weekend. And... Wait. What? You guys want me to find more positive ways to express myself, right? Then what could be more positive than helping a sweet old lady and witch-grandniece? Listen, Nancy. I got a lot going on right now, okay? I gotta schmooze this land owner and convince him to reject the train company's offer. And I can't do that if I'm worried about you. Well, think of it as taking me in protective custody. Of an octogenarian? Okay, that old bird can kick some serious butt if she has to. Okay, but... But, you're still grounded, and remember our agreement. Yes, of course. Check in, text, call, send an owl, send a raven. Don't worry, I'll blow up your phone. - And, I'll vaporize yours right back. - Okay, Dad. - Yeah, it didn't really work, did it? - Not really. Hey, listen. The Sheriff's got an eye on Willie Wharton. If he gets within 100 feet from you, they're gonna arrest him. So, if anything happens, call Hannah. If you can't get a hold of her, call Nate. Got it. Nice doing business with you, Counselor. Mmm-hmm. Did you really cook this? I'm 16. And leave my jacket here. Mmm. I'm here, doing my check-in. I'm at Twin Elms, yeah. Okay. Love you, yeah. Bye. We're only staying for one night, right? Yeah, why? No reason. Okay, look. Just because my aunt invited you over doesn't change anything between us. I didn't expect it to. Aunt Flora's very important to me, so please promise me you won't make some kind of a joke about this. I would never do that. If she's really seeing ghosts, then... I mean, I wanna find out why. Can we just, you know, suspend our feud for just the night? Fine, whatever. Good. I mean, if this place really is haunted... today's gonna be exciting! Did I forget to mention my great-aunt is a little extra? You gotta be kidding me. Skater bear. You don't see that every day. You think I'm crazy, huh? Smidge. Come in. Why, thank you. Hello, darling. Come on in. And I'm gonna make you girls some lemonade. Holy nutcracker, Batman. Aunt Flora does the best she can, but it's a little too much house for her. I always thought she should make it into a museum and charge admission. Yeah, I'd pony up for that. You know who that is? You're too young to know who that is? Of course I know who that is. Oh, I swear that boy had hips made of butter. Not that I danced with Mick Jagger every night. Truth be told, I did cut in on another girl... for about 20 seconds till security moved in. - That's so funny. - Yeah. And you have photographic evidence to prove it. I know. Which is more than I have to say about my burlesque career. - What? - No. You were a burlesque dancer? - Mmm-hmm. - Why didn't you tell me? Oh, it's not a conversation for youngsters. But that is so cool! What is your burlesque name? No, no, no. No, no, no, girls. I've said quite enough. No, trust me, you haven't said enough. Yeah, come on, please? One shimmy. No, come on, those... All right, fine. ♪ And here she is, boys ♪ ♪ And here she is, world ♪ ♪ Ladies and gentlemen ♪ ♪ Miss Fabulous ♪ ♪ Strawberry Deville ♪ Whoo! You better put that leg down before you bust a hip. Thank you so much. Living all this time must be amazing. It has its moments. Helen, would you get the apple pie I've been cooling in the kitchen, darling? Just texting my dad good night. He keeps tabs on me. Sure. So, um... When do the undead show up? Sometimes it's weird sounds, music I didn't turn on... Then suddenly, the lights start flickering crazily. And then... things just stop making sense. Don't make sense how? Unfortunately, one cannot be told what happens at Twin Elms. You have to experience it yourself. You mean, like, the Matrix? I knew you'd get the reference. What? What, honey? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What, darling? Helen, what is it? What? What? What? There was in... In the window. It was a face, out the window. It was looking at me... - And it was, like, disgusting. - What do you mean? It was like a warthog or something. The pig farmer. - Have you seen him before? - Never in the flesh. Ew! I hate that word. - Wait! That thing might still be out there. - Hope so. Oh, my gosh. Baller move, Drew. Hunting down a ghost in front of a haunted mansion, and you forgot to bring your flashlight. God. Son of a... Hey, Nancy. Flora got you picking up trash here at Twin Elms, too? Deputy Patrick? You scared the bejesus out of me. What are you doing out here? I didn't like the way Sheriff talked to Flora yesterday, so I figured I'd come up here and check the place out myself. That's awfully nice of you, and a little random. Not really. I've been coming out to Twin Elms since I was a kid. Flora actually used to pay me to mow her lawns in the summer, before she turned it purple and pink. Yeah. Oh, you haven't happened to see, uh... a pig-man running around, did you? What? Helen thought she saw a pig-mongrel-esque thing. Oh! So you saw the Colfax ghost? You know him? Everybody in River Heights knows the story. But no one's actually ever seen him in the flesh. Please. Please don't say that word. Fair enough. You think Jeffrey Barnes had something to do with it? You recognized his car? I went to school with Derek's older brothers. Spoiled bunch. All of 'em. Are you linking them with the ghost? Okay, well. I wanna walk the property once more before I leave. And call me if anything else happens. And tell Flora I'll drop in here to make sure everything's okay. Thanks, Deputy. Maybe you're not as big a tool as I thought you were. Why, thank you, Nancy. Maybe you're not as much of a pain in the butt I thought you were. Much obliged. Oh. You, uh, might have an easier time getting around with a little more light. - Here. - Oh, right. Thanks. Stay outta trouble. You know me. Fortunately, I do. I told you, Derek and his entire family are away on vacation. Mmm-hmm. What a perfectly timed alibi. I call. All right. I'll see your 10 cents, and raise you another 10. Okay, Nancy, if you're such a genius, then why would Derek scare me and my aunt just to get back at you? You tell me. Rich people are psychos. I thought your dad was a lawyer. And I'm out. Not that kind of lawyer. I mean, half of his clients don't have enough money to pay him. I forgot your dad's such a saint. And your mother, Nancy? My mom was a civil rights advocate. She badgered politicians to open their eyes and help the little guy. Did she prank them? She may have had a more subtle approach than I do. Look, there's more than one black Mercedes in River Heights. Not with the same license plate, there isn't. Make up your mind. Earlier, you said you didn't see the license plate clearly. Derek did not do this. And when you find out that I am right, you will owe me a major apology. If I find out you're right, I'll vote you for prom queen. - I'm already prom queen. - All right, girls. Girls, this game is not gonna bet itself. Let's go. It's just you and me, Flora. Your move. All right. Straight flush. Read 'em and weep. - Oh, Lord. - Well, that's creepy. Oh! I... I saw it! - I saw it! - What did you see? I don't know. A shadow. Under the table! Really? Cover your eyes, girls! - Why? - Just trust me! Is it just me or are the light bulbs floating? Oh, God, I hate this part. Whatever's happening, there's a perfectly logical explanation for this. Totally logical. What do you usually do when this happens? Pray. Nancy! Ow! Let go of me! Nancy! Oh no, you don't! No, you don't! You let her go! Let her go, I say! No, no. Come on, come on, come on. Let's get out of here. Come on, guys. Get out of the kitchen. Out, out, out of the kitchen! Wait. Everybody in here, quick. Come on! Go! Wait, no! There's that thing, the pig! Whatever happens, don't open this door. Nancy! A rubber mask, really? Step up your game, dude. Never mind. Who's scared now, Nancy? Nancy. Nancy, it's okay. Oh, darling, after every haunting, I get that same awful headache. It should be gone soon. Well, I was hoping to wake up and realize this was all some crazy dream. Hey, Dad. Everything's great. We may have had a ghost sighting. I wanna tell you all about it, but Flora's just about to serve us some breakfast, so... Well, that sounds exciting. I want to hear all about it. Yeah, yeah, I'll give you the blow-by-blow when I see ya. Thanks, Dad. Okay. Love ya. Love you more. Here, dear. This ought to help fight off those dragons. So, what happened exactly? You saved us from the ghost. Well, all I remember is screaming like a baby before everything went black. And here I thought my cheese was finally sliding off the cracker. Now that I know the haunting is real, I kinda wish I were senile. You guys don't think that last night was actually supernatural, do you? Well, how else would you explain it? I mean, that thing dragged me around the house at NASCAR speeds, and then it disappeared and then it reappeared in another part of the house. What about the floating light bulbs? No, there's gotta be an explanation. Like... Well, so what do we know? One, we know a black Mercedes was lurking around Twin Elms. - Nancy, I told you... - I know, I know. I'm just stating the facts. Okay? I'll give you a chance to prove me wrong. Two, we know somebody came in here and scared us half to death. And three, we know it felt insanely real. Were all the doors and windows locked last night? Oh, yes. I double-check them every night. Are you sure? Maybe... I mean, the... This is an old house. Maybe the locks don't work so well. I had the locks redone just last year. Wait, did you guys... Did you guys notice these footprints? I thought that you did that last night when you were running around in the pink grass. No. No. I wipe my feet. I'm very well-trained. As if this house isn't messy enough. Yes, somewhere in here, there must be a... Whoa. I can't believe it. Well, you don't see that every day. Mean girls first. I'm just kidding. Stay here, Auntie. You don't have to tell me twice. This must have been some kind of servants' quarters back in the day. Hey, hey, hey, hey. More pink footprints. Yes! A dark, creepy tunnel. I told you this was gonna be awesome. Huh. Now we know how they got in. Mmm. Oh. So that's how they attacked me with the drawers. Well, we're gonna have to break it to Flora there's no skeletons in these walls. Aw, right. Hey, Nancy, come take a look at this. Oh, this must be how they control the lights. But I wonder what this controls. The ghost must have an accomplice. Okay. But why did it feel so real? If people expect a ghost, they'll see a ghost. I think something more than suggestion is at work here. Well, it could have been sound waves or carbon monoxide. No, if it was carbon monoxide, you'd be a ghost, too. But it could have been some type of drug. Could someone have spiked your food? Not a chance. I bought that food yesterday. No one but the three of us touched it before dinner. Well, thanks for the help. - I'll let you know what we find out. - Bye. Later. What about visitors? I mean, this place needs a lot of upkeep. Maybe the guys who painted your grass or a plumber, or a carpenter? Good idea. I'll make a list. Wow, that's a lot of people. Mmm-hmm. I included some of my gentlemen callers. Oh, Auntie! What? Too many? Never. Thank you. Hello, my name's Nancy Drew. I understand you recently did some work at Twin Elms. Hi, this is Helen Corning. My aunt hired you to rebuild her gazebo? You replaced the plumbing? You did the plaster work? You replaced the windows? Oops, sorry. I didn't mean to call you. Really? Are you sure about that? No, that's great. Yes, yes, thank you. The air conditioner! Hmm. You said the repairman came over two weeks ago, but the company had no record of sending anyone. Wait. What is this thing? There's a hose connected to the AC. I don't know, but it was taped to the pole. What is that? We should take that to the police. Yeah, well, let me connect the dots first. We have to get this to the chem lab, you know, isolate the chemicals, find out where it came from. And you just so happen to know a chemist that can help us with that? No, but I know someone who can. Bess and George. Oh, God. Oh, man. I'm late for community service. Chemicals? Identification is no problem. I got chromatography papers in the lab at school and this sick new chem app on my phone. So, it's okay. - Okay. - Drew! You took advantage of Deputy Patrick yesterday, but you're not taking advantage of me. Well, hey, I can talk and pick up trash at the same time. Not on my watch. If you don't get back to work, I'm gonna add two more weeks to your sentence. Oh, come on. Why stop at two? - Nancy. - We can make it four, if you want. Here. So you don't end up with a life sentence. This should help. Get out of my sight, Drew. You're free to go. What just happened? What does it look like? I mean, I got Nancy pardoned. One of the lesser-known advantages of being from the oldest family in River Heights. Don't you mean "richest"? Don't you mean, "Thank you"? You guys coming or what? Come on. I'm gonna... Hey, you behaving? Of course. How's your trip? Well, I'm leaving now. I'll text you when I get there. It'll be a couple of hours. - Okay. Love ya. - Love you more. Am I the only one not cool with Helen being here? Her great-aunt is the one in trouble. So, what, you make nice with the nerdy chicks until you get what you want? Hey, you're the ones who attacked my boyfriend. After he harassed Bess online. Hey, guys. This isn't about our problem. It's about Flora. So let's just isolate whatever's in this tank, and we can talk later. Okay? Fine. So... How do we get in? Well, I figured you know how to pick a lock. Oh. So I get in a little trouble with the fuzz and now I'm public enemy number one? - No, I just thought that... - Seriously, Nance, you gonna pick the lock or what? Well, yeah, totally. Don't worry about it. Sorry. This... This takes all night. You can't even go a night without talking to your bae? Okay. You guys are just jealous because you don't have anyone. Oh, you mean, no one to hide behind? Okay. Who's still hungry? I know I am. Maybe now's a good time to break out that cheesecake. Okay. Good idea. Come on, guys, take a bite. Yeah, this is seriously God's cheesecake. Oh, blueberry. That remind you of anyone, Helen? We're not gonna eat traitor cake. Technically, Helen's not a traitor. She's just our enemy. Probably shouldn't eat any anyways, my skin is a mess. Well, if you don't wanna eat cheesecake, that's fine, don't eat it. But you really shouldn't worry about sweets giving you pimples, Bess. That's the best thing about being so smart. You don't have to look pretty. You won't be going out, anyways. - You're freaking dead. - Let's go for it. Guys, stop! I can sit here and pretend to be polite, but it doesn't change the fact that she's the girlfriend of some guy that thinks it's okay to humiliate another human being. You know exactly what he did, and you did nothing to stop it. What was I supposed to do? I don't know. You could've unfollowed him on Instagram, threatened to break up with him, expressed even the slightest shred of disapproval. That's so easy for you to say. You have nothing to lose. Maybe, but at least I still have my soul. - George, come on... - Nancy, are you that blind? What, just because you found a new friend that's more popular than we are? Well, is that really what you think of me? I don't know what to think anymore, Nance. But I do know that as soon as all of this is over, she's gonna go right back to laughing at all of us behind our backs. You don't know what it's like to be me. People are constantly expecting things out of me, like how I look, and who I can hang out with, - and who I don't hang out with and... - Oh, blah, blah, blah. "Don't hate me because I'm rich and pretty." - I didn't say that! - Then what did you say? 'Cause I sure didn't hear a "sorry" anywhere in there. I don't know, but I am sorry. It's ready. Look, Helen. I appreciate you, you know, getting me outta community service. I get it. I should go. And I'll let you know what we find out. Thank you. Good riddance. Come on, you guys. It's over. Mmm. Does anyone smell butterscotch pudding, like, on a burning tire? I was gonna say, uh... bug spray souffle. That's eggnog on fire. It is the same chemical found in all of those things. Myristicin. Myristi-what? What is that? It's a psychoactive compound isolated from nutmeg. So, somebody made us see ghosts with nutmeg? Yeah. You know, it's a little-known fact, but if it's consumed in high enough concentrations, it can cause all types of physical reactions, like nausea or hallucinations, and then you wake up with a really nasty hangover. You said the hose was connected to the vent, so someone had a way of releasing the chemical when the AC was on. Didn't know you knew so much about hallucinogenic drugs. Chemistry's awesome. But it says that you'd need a lot of nutmeg before you could get any effect. Well, the concentration in that canister was 50 times more powerful and aerosolized, so it hit your brains instantly. So somebody must be buying a lot of nutmeg. Can you guys track that down in the morning? Uh-oh! It is morning. I better go over to Derek's house and try to get him to confess. I'm taking the evidence. Is this safe to carry? Yeah. Just don't drop it. I said don't. Okay, just don't... Yeah, just don't drop it. It's not funny. Stop messing with her. Not funny. It can kill people. Call Dad. You've reached Carson Drew. Please leave a message. That's weird. Hey, Dad, it's me. I didn't get a text from you. Call me. Busted. Well, well. Now what do we have here? Don't you think you're overreacting just a little? - I caught you breaking into their house. - It wasn't the house. It was the garage, and I was only trying to see if the car had any evidence to connect it with the haunting of Twin Elms. Which, by the way, it does. Oh, yeah. Uh... Pink flamingo paint. Damning evidence, if I ever saw any. Yeah, actually, it is damning evidence. Cheese and rice, Nancy, again? Handcuffs, really? Don't worry, Hannah. I've started thinking nickel's my color. Your niece here was caught breaking into the Barnes household. - Is that true? - Depends on how you mean "true." Nancy, I explicitly said, "Don't go into the garage till I get there." Wait. You knew about this? Yeah. I told her about it. Yeah, after Deputy Patrick checked out Twin Elms the other night, he suggested we go to, uh... uh, go investigate the Barnes' Mercedes. I didn't want Nancy to get in trouble again, so I told her I'd go over there with her. Must have gotten our signals crossed. I thought Deputy Patrick left me hanging, so I decided to take a look myself. With a lock pick set? It's perfectly legal to own lock picks. Up until the point where you stick them in someone else's lock. Look, I can vouch for Nancy. Sorry. Good luck with that. If you let her go, I'll make sure she gets home without any more trouble. What just happened in there? Wasn't gonna let my boss arrest the bravest kid in town twice in one week. No one's ever stood up to the Barnes' family before. Because no one's ever been that dumb. Where were you last night? I told you. I stayed at Bess'. Really? Then why did Bess' mom think that she was staying with us? 'Cause... 'Cause Bess, George, Helen and I broke into the high school and used the chem lab to isolate a hallucinogenic drug that's making Flora see ghosts, but we left everything the way we found it... That's not exactly the point. Nancy, you are out of control. You can't just do whatever you want and expect to get away with it. Look... I made some calls. Barnes' family checked in to the Pike's Resort in Aspen four days ago. Haven't left since. So, Helen was right, but... - Who was driving the car to Twin Elms? - I don't know. I'm still trying to figure that out. The police are doing their job, but next time you think about pulling a B&E, try giving me a call first. There's some people in this town who actually care. Okay, this time you are really grounded. No fake sleepovers or haunted houses or... Especially investigations. And I'm confiscating your long board. Has Dad called you? No, but we don't usually argue until after lunch. Why? You mean he hasn't called you? - No. - Since when? Hey, Nance. What up? My dad hasn't texted or returned a call from me or Hannah in 15 hours. You know how weird that is, Nate. We have a rule. Last thing at night and first thing in the morning. You know, no exceptions. Yeah, I haven't heard from him either. Well, maybe there's no cell service at the campsite. Campsite? I... I thought you said he... I thought he was at a hotel. No, no. This dude that your dad's meeting, Owen Michaelson, will only close the deal if you go camping with him. Like real camping. Like backpacks and canteens. The cell service is probably terrible there. But that's not like him. I mean, ever since Mom died he's been even more anal about calling than I am. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, hon. I didn't realize he hadn't told you. I got caught up in all this train paperwork and didn't think to check on you. I'm falling down on my godfather duties. If he calls, I will make sure that you talk to him. - Okay, Nate. Thanks. - Sure thing. Well, who'd have thunk? Carson camping. Huh, that's a relief. No phone number. - Hey. - We found the spice company. Bess and I are suiting up to go on our way into their records room right now. They'll never know what hit them. You sound weird. My dad hasn't called in 18 hours. I mean... something's off and I can't put my finger on it. Your gut is usually right, Drew. When in doubt, listen to it. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Holy cow! You scared... Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. Are you okay? What happened? Yeah. I know I'm the last person you wanna see right now, but I broke up with Derek. Wow, I did't know you had it in you. What did he do? Nothing, it was all me. Look, sorry, can we talk about this in the car? - Huh? Yeah. - My aunt's car. Come on. Can you drive? Technically... You know, George was right about me. I mean, what I said about Bess was horrible. Who would say that about another person? You've got a point. But the thing is I don't even know why I said it. It just came out of my mouth like... I guess some part of me was still trying to defend Derek. I really like Bess. In a different world, we'd be friends. You skate a lot better than you drive. No one drives in Chicago. Look, just... Just do what you think is right, you know? Don't do what other people expect you to do. That's so freakin' terrifying. And you have no idea. It's just so easy for you and George and Bess because you're just so good at things. Important things, that matter. And you're funny and you're smart. What do I have other than my hair and Derek? Well, you actually don't have Derek anymore. Your hair's amazing. You know, I'm supposed to be the hero in my own story but I'm the villain. I mean, I've never had to be brave or smart and definitely never had to be nice. Maybe now's your chance. At least the brave part. Nice we can... work on. Mmm-hmm. And speaking of nice, how... How good are you at accepting apologies? Apologies? For what? I was wrong about the Barnes' alibi. I told you, Nancy Drew. I'm sorry. No, I should have believed you. I'd grovel at your feet... but I'm having a little trouble driving. You have no idea how good it feels to be right. And there's one other thing. I think that whole vigilante justice might not be the direction I wanna go in for my future. Are you apologizing about Derek? I don't... I don't know if I wanna go that far, you know, but... Can I just say that maybe revenge isn't the answer. That sort of thing. Thank you, Nancy. Yeah, well... Just don't wanna be that girl, you know? So I guess we have no suspect. Oh, I've got ideas, but... Well, I've gotta find my dad first. Let's start this car again. Yo! What gives? I can't do this. You gotta... You gotta go. You're the chemistry genius. Anyone asks me a serious question, the ruse ain't gonna hold. You'll be fine. I can tell you everything you need to know. Yeah, I will be fine because you're gonna go in there and you're gonna do this. See? Look at you. I have one tiny adjustment though. Oh... Oh. See? You look dangerous. I feel kinda dangerous. Feel empowered just standing next to you. Now, go in there, track down some nutmeg. Okay. - Got it. Yeah. - You got it. Got his room key. Dad? Dad, are you here? Hey, who leaves their cell phone during a business trip? After I talked to him last night he never got any of my messages. I mean, Nate said he was out of cell range. I mean, this makes no sense. Okay, stay focused. What are the clues? I don't know. I have no idea. Okay, take a deep breath and do your thing. You got this. Maybe we got something better than clues. I already gave you the keys to the room. You are not getting access to the security feed, too. I told you this is a matter of life and death. "I told you this is a matter of life and death." Don't mock me. Clearly you care about customer satisfaction. Not really. Ooh! Someone put a little more than cream and sugar in this. Get out of here! This is nothing but coffee. Then why is it so sticky? Ugh! Well, your boss is not gonna like it when he finds out you've been drinking on the job. Here it is. What's he doing to my dad? It looks like he's just putting him to sleep. Yeah, but how do we know that? If he wanted to hurt your dad he would've used a gun or a knife or something. It can't be a robbery. All he wanted was my dad. Well, at least we know what happened. We have the evidence, we can go to the police. Can't see the kidnapper's face. Oh, man. Wait, wait. It looks really familiar. Come on, Drew, think. Anything? This happened last night while we were at the chem lab. We did it, Nancy. You would have been so proud of me. What are you talking about? Bess found the name of the nutmeg buyer. It's William Wharton. Do me a favor. Tell your daddy that Willie Wharton said to get onboard. Now get out of the way. Wharton kidnapped my dad. He's been haunting Twin Elms. Look, look, guys, I love you guys so much and everything, but... I gotta go. Talk to you... Call you when I know more. Okay? Bye. We have the evidence. Let's get help. Deputy? Yes, I figured out a bunch of stuff. Can you meet me at Twin Elms? Thanks. I think my dad's in the hidden staircase. Wharton doesn't know we know it exists, and he kidnapped my dad after we left. Come on. Sheriff? Trying you again. Sheriff? Deputy Patrick. Come in. Over. Oh, my God. - Deputy? Deputy, wake up. - Okay. Okay. He's not dead, he's just really knocked out. Wharton must be here. Dumb flashlight. Why are you doing this? You're too good a lawyer. You were persuading people who wanted the train to change their minds. Come on. You got some paperwork to sign. Out. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Let's go. - Nate. Thank God. "Thank God." That's funny. Ow. Wait. You're a part of this? Part of it? He's the one who brought me into it. You were best man at my wedding. You were a pallbearer at Catherine's funeral. That guy is like my uncle. I'm sorry, Carson. I had to. How much is the train company paying you to deliver Twin Elms? A lot. You could have come to me if you needed money, Nate. But I got in a hole so deep you couldn't possibly dig me out. This was supposed to be clean. We scare Flora, she sells, she makes bank. Town gets a new train, I get out of debt. Everybody wins. We were fighting to stop the train. Yeah. Hmm... I'm pretty convincing, huh? A couple more scary nights, and Flora would have begged to sell. And then Nancy got involved. Hey, we can't do anything. Not with them having guns. They may have guns but we have something better. Sign the form. I've told you very politely... No. Listen to the lady. You know, for a guy half in the bag you sure handle stress pretty well. He has a teenage daughter. Why would you go to all this trouble for one plot of land? In going through Twin Elms, all the other property owners would fall in line. Nobody would be able to stop the train. But there's no way I'll allow the sale to go through, Nate. We know. That's why I'm afraid we can't let you leave. Hey. No, no, no. Come here. We never talked about killing anyone. I figured you couldn't handle it. Don't worry. I'll take care of it myself. No, no. Hey. No. None of this. No. There's no reason to harm him. I've been forging his signature ever since he came back to River Heights. Look. Carson will keep his mouth shut because he wants to live. Right? You know me better than that, Nate. There's no way to keep these two from talking about this. And if you think anybody's gonna fall for your plan in framing Jeffrey Barnes, then you're even stupider than I thought. I've survived four husbands, to be killed by your sorry butt. That brat found the room. What... Oh, don't worry, dear. Just another normal Saturday night for me. That sounds like the back door. I'll take care of her. Stupid son of a... Nancy, now! Help! Help me! Help! Run, Helen! Nobody move and I won't hurt her. Let her go. She's just a child! You're not a murderer, Nate. You gonna get that? Shut up for once. Just shut up. Please let her go! Come on. Argh! I'll untie the others! Help! Get it off me! It's okay. Get off me! Get it off me! Well, you don't see that every day. Should've brought cover, Drew. I... I may have to follow up with you later. Hey, Deputy, uh... Thanks for everything. Thanks for believing in me. It's what I'm here for. Wait. Your flashlight. Let me get it for you. You keep it. Something tells me you're gonna need it again. Hey... No matter what your future holds, you can always brag about the day you turned a grown man pink. Different guy, new shade. It's not the same. I don't do those things anymore. - Right. - Come on. Hey, Helen, are you coming? Yeah, I figured, since... it's over, you know. Yeah, we'd all just go back to hating you? Yeah, you're not getting off that easy. - Besides, you still owe us a slice of traitor cake. - Ah-ha! I... I told you it's enemy cake. - Leave it alone. - Well, you could just learn the word. The right word. It'd be so much easier. It's Aunt Flora's cheesecake. I'll catch up to you guys in a few. Bet you never thought you'd be saving your own dad, did you? You know how many times you saved my butt? Hey. Hey. I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to you. Let me go. I wanna... I wanna do one. You do it. I don't know what I'm doing. - That's not bad. - I really want... What was that? What was that? Wanted to see what was gonna happen. You know, maybe I could get used to this small town life after all. Oh, that reminds me. My cousin Emily is coming home to River Heights to get married at the Lilac Inn. And after all we've been through, we could use a little fun in the sun, don't you think? Of course. Yes. Sounds good to me. Sure. Deep lake, a dark forest, some creepy old inn. What could possibly go wrong? Yeah, all we need is an evil twin and we'll have the makings of an awesome new mystery. I have to get a photo with us. Come on, Nancy, get in the picture. - Come on, Bess. - Fine. Okay. Guys are so pretty. One, two, three. #sleuthing. Actually, I'm done with mysteries. Yeah, from now on, I just wanna sit back, talk about boys, Instagram, you know, do my nails... - What? - What? Just kidding. Subtitles by explosiveskull
