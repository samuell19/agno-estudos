[TITLE MUSIC] Mel, I knew you'd come. Was there ever any doubt? Now, let's see what kind of a mess you've gotten yourself into, my dear. Hurry up, Mel, before the evil Dr. Pasquale and his henchmen find us. Hm, not bad. Not bad. Ooh, very bad. Now, I've got some good news, and I've got some bad news. The good news is I can free you. But the bad news is if you get off the table, the whole room's going to explode. Then make love to me-- one last time. I was hoping you'd say that. [SENSUAL MUSIC] Mel, untie me! Not so fast. This is kind of fun. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [FUNKY MUSIC] Bidding is now open. [SIGH] Too rich for my blood. [FAINT ZAPPING] Ooh, I think I've had a little, uh, too much to drink. Woo! [LAUGHS] Get on with it. Welcome to Blonde Heaven. A blonde on your arm, a song in your heart-- or your money cheerfully refunded. Brothers and sisters, I humbly request your assistance. No! I am high bidder. [ZAP] [GROAN] We cannot permit this! She claims every prize! Am I not within my right? It's not quite so strong. Is it not the law? Brothers and sisters, I humbly request your assistance. Let us join together so that I, your humble servant, need the combined strength of the many to do what none of us may do alone. It is the law. GROUP: It is the law. [WHOOSHING] [SENSUAL MUSIC] [HISS] [HISS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [COUNTRY MUSIC] (SINGING) I was born a hundred years too late. I wasted 30 years trying to compensate. I'll just accept my fate. It ain't fair, but that's the breaks. The 20th century man, that's what it takes. 'Cause my horse is a Harley. My gun is a guitar. I'm sorry. It's just that you have such an interesting look. Are you a model? I'm an actress. Here, take my card. There's someone I think you should meet if you want to get ahead in this town. Is your friend an agent? In a manner of speaking. Call that number and make an appointment after work. You've got such a fresh look. I just know she's going to love you. [ORGAN MUSIC] ANGIE: We can be friends-- you know, platonic. Sure. I mean, the whole world don't revolve around sex. Think I'm gonna change into some fresh duds, too. ANGIE: This way, we can concentrate on other things we have in common. If it were just for the physical, we'd have never stayed together as long as we did. Yeah, I think we can be friends. Don't you? KYLE: Yeah. I think platonic sounds nice, real nice. Like you said, the world doesn't revolve around sex. How do I look? KYLE: You ain't no natural blonde. I'll tell you that. Yee-haw. Some things never change. Foreplay's for sissies. I have to admit. You can slow dance with the best of them. Angie, I'm so pleased you could make it. It's not that your dress isn't lovely, Angie. I just think we'll get a better look at you in something like this. Is this OK? It's the only thing that I have that belonged to my mother. Mm, it's lovely. I'll be outside. Making another music video? Just thought I'd check out the new recruits. It's your lucky day, sweet cheeks. I'm making a preemptive bid. You can't do that! Iliana-- Won't ever know about it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] You should have warned me. Such a shock. I'm sorry. I thought you'd be pleased. I am pleased, very pleased. Thank you. ANGIE: I thought I was just going to dinner. Don't worry. You won't finish the night on an empty stomach. I don't know if I want to be here. Good evening, ladies. Welcome to my party. We're shooting a music video for our new album next week. And you've got just the profile I've been looking for. [FUNKY MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [FAINT ZAPPING] ILIANA: Come with me. I have a surprise for you. They're all your size. I don't understand. Angie, if you want the powers that be in this town to start recognizing you as star material, you have to start dressing the part. But I couldn't possibly accept all this. Oh, yes you can. [ROCK MUSIC] (SINGING) And I can say things that you're dying to hear. I could do that, make everything all right. Act so sincere, I could to that, too. Be anything that you want me to be 'cause I can play the part so easily. There are so many things I could do if I could love you. There are so many things I would do if I didn't love you. There are so many things I could do. Like I could be tough when you're weak inside. Yeah, that could be me. Never see me cry. I'm the strong, silent type. That's my specialty. Be anything that you want me to be 'cause I can play the part so easily. There are so many things I could do if I could love you. There are so many things I would do If I didn't love you. There are so many things I could do. Like I could be tough when you're weak inside. [SLOW MUSIC] Is this how it ends for the great Alamacerian, big game hunter, great explorer, philanthropist, husband, lover? Is this how it ends for the great Alamacerian? I must accept my fate like a man. Time to move in for the kill. That's OK. Go ahead. He's all yours. OK. But if I'm gonna do all the work, I want some of your money. [FUNKY MUSIC] Let's go sneak in on them. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [WATER RUNNING] I think we should set Angie up with one of those studio executives tonight. They spend so much time talking about the deal. They never actually do anything with the girls. Iliana, Megan says we called dibs. That bitch. Come in here with me. It's, um, more private. Oh, uh, I can't. Oh, yes you can. I have a girlfriend. Oh, do you? I think. Oh, how nice. She's [INAUDIBLE]. Yes, she would. How very interesting, love. Why don't you just take your hat off and stay awhile? I always did like doing it under the stars. Well, personally I wouldn't have it any other way. Now, I'm thinking we give this male escort thing a chance to, um, prove itself. Don't you? [INAUDIBLE]! But first, we must pay homage to the state god of the Pharaoh! [SCREAM]. Ah, ah, ah, there'll be no notifying your grave-robbing compatriot! [LAUGHS] The mummy will have his way. [SCREAMING] Kyle, what on Earth? Have you been following me? And a good thing, too. I thought you said foreplay was for sissies. I guess I've gone Hollywood. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SLOW MUSIC] [ORGAN PLAYS] [SCREAM] Damn, Angie, that dress don't mean much to the imagination. Imagine this, cowboy-- no panties. Angie, we gotta talk. [HISS] [DRAMATIC ORGAN MUSIC] [HISS] [FUNKY MUSIC] (SINGING) When you feel your funky side, you have to set your groove alive. Experience the eternal motion of your funky emotion. She can be your downfall or your salvation. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Kyle! They said I could come back here and talk to you. I don't have nothing to say to you. Good-- because I didn't come here to talk. [WHOOSHING] [HISS] [SCREAM] [INTENSE MUSIC] Hello? Die, vampire fiend! Ms. Blackwell? I'm your biggest fan! Pluto Amschwiller, vampire hunter. The pleasure is mine. PLUTO: But you're just a movie vampire. I should know. I'm the president of your fan club. You're that Pluto ass-wad? Uh-huh. BLACKWELL: I had to get an unlisted phone number because of you, and a post office box, and a fist full of restraining orders. Get a life! Just like in "Brothel of Blood." I'm sorry it has to end like this. You turkey. You've already been prepped. Is there a pop-up thermometer in your butt that let's me know when you're done? [SHOUT] [SCREAMS] I got this idea from one of your films, "None but the Depraved!" [WHIMPERING] Of course. How could I have forgotten? But I'm surprised you didn't recognize this. Of course, you wore this in "Diary of a Mad Hussy." Oh, it's seared into my memory. [MOANING] "Torture garden." Mm. "Sex in a Single Vampire." "All Lust in the Crypt." [MOANING] Oh, "Vampire Screen Test." [MOANING] And of course, "Vampire Sluts of Sodom." [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GROWLING] [THUD] Brothers and sisters. Sorry, sweet cakes, Megan wants you in one piece. Release her. I said release her. That's for Megan to decide. We've elected a new leader. Meet the newest member of the family, and my new producer. Relax, Blond Heaven is getting out of the escort business, and you're gonna be a star. Oh, Kyle. I love you. Forever and ever. I love you, too-- forever. Forever. Thanks for doing this with me. Look, let's just get your stuff and get out of here. OK? I can't handle a big scene today. But you're my rock. [SCOFFS] Right. [KNOCKING] Yeah, what? Look, I don't mean to disturb you, but I came to get my things. Sure, whatever. Did you read my note? No. God, you're impossible. Why? Zeke, I'm leaving you. Don't. Zeke. Rachel, you want me to get your bags? Carly, I think Zeke and I need to talk this through. Rachel-- You can see the pain he's in. You're impossible! I can't leave him like this. Look, I just don't want to see you get hurt. But I'm a big girl. Fine. Give me a call when you're finished talking. OK. And, Zeke, I'll see you later. Sure. Zeke, I didn't mean to hurt you. [SENSUAL MUSIC] I just needed-- I just needed to get your attention. You got it. Sherry, how nice to see you! I can't believe it! Do you feel better? Yes, thank you. Good. Welcome back. I saved your favorite spot for you. Have a seat. Great. Now we can get started. Good morning, class. CLASS: Good morning. TEACHER: You're gonna be very happy to know today that we're leaving behind the vases of flowers and the bowls of fruit. I know you love that. And we're going to be moving on to the human form. Would you like to come out? How are you? Come on up. I'll take your robe for you. Oh, sure. There we go. Now I want you to think about emotion. How do you want the viewer to feel? Notice also how each line of the body flows into the next. I want you to capture that flow. You can start to draw. [CLASSICAL MUSIC] [HEARTBEAT] Sherry, what's wrong? Are you all right? I'm sorry. I-- I can't. WOMAN: Baby, I'm home. I thought I'd come and surprise you. Fucking son of a bitch! I MAN: Sorry. That was supposed to be our thing! [DOOR SLAMS] [MOANING] [GUITAR MUSIC] That was incredible. You sure know how to hit all the right spots. Yeah, you weren't too bad yourself. So how long you gonna be around? As long as it takes to eat my pancakes, darling. You sure you don't want to stick around a little bit longer? I sure could use more of that lovin'. Not enough time, darling. Not enough time. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Suit yourself. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [THUNDERING] The hell? [OLD ROCK MUSIC] [WHOOSHING] My god. Your breakfast is ready, honey. Kayley? What the hell's going on here? What do you mean, baby? This place, it's not what it was. Come on over here. Get something to eat. I think you're getting a little light headed. What year is it? Year? It's 1955, man. What year do you want it to be? [LAUGHS] OK. OK, this is some kind of joke, right? Hey! I'm talking to you! Where you going, sweetie? This has got to be a dream. I got something special for you. Mm. [WHOOSHING] [SENSUAL MUSIC] [SURF ROCK] [CROWD CHEERING] (SINGING) Well, I'm down here on the beach, and I'm eyeballing bikinis. The girls are going crazy. Everybody wants to meet me. My surfboard's name is Woody. I take him everywhere. When I strut my stuff, everybody stops and stares. So go, Daddy. Ho, Daddy. Go, man. Go! Hang ten! Fumalaka! What do you know? I got a woody! He's got a woody. I got a woody! He's got a woody. When I walk into a restaurant to get myself some fries, the waitress started smiling and she said what a surprise. Ooh, he's got a woody. I was on my best behavior, polite as I could be. I said I'm glad to meet ya. This here is my woody. So go, Daddy! Go, Daddy! Go, man! Go! Hang ten! Fumalaka! What do you know? I got a woody! Ooh, ah, I got a woody! He's got a woody. You've got to stand up tall when your back's against the wall. You've gotta be all that you can be like my friend Woody. Ooh, he's got a woody. Oh, wow. Did you see what that guy has? A woody! Wow! So awesome! Like, I've never seen anything like it. You've never seen a woody like that? Oh, he walks around on the beach with that thing. He even goes in the restaurant. He won't go anywhere without his woody. Oh, man, I don't know. Maybe I want to meet him. You do not. I don't know. What a woody! Oh! Well, my girlfriend says she digs me cause I get her in the mood. Ooh, he's got a woody. She said I drive her crazy cause I'm really a cool dude. Ooh, has a woody. Hey, barbariba corumba noogie noogie! So don't leave home without it, boys. I'm talking about your woody. Ooh, he's got a woody. Go, daddy! Ho, daddy! Go, man! Go! Hang ten! Fumalaka! What do you know? I got a woody! He's got a woody. I got a woody! He's got a woody! You gotta stand up tall when your back's against the wall. You've gotta be all you can be like my friend Woody! [CROWD CHEERING] Well, I'm down here on the beach, and I'm eyeballing bikinis. The girls are going crazy. Everybody wants to meet me. My surfboard's name is Woody. I take him everywhere. When I strut my stuff, everybody stops and stares. So go, daddy! Ho, daddy! Go, man! Go! Hang ten! Fumalaka! What do you know? I got a woody! Ooh, ah, I got a woody! He's got a woody. You gotta stand up tall when your back's against the wall. You gotta be all that you can be like my friend Woody! Ooh, he's got a woody. [ZAP] [SLOW MUSIC] Mm. Ow. Oh, don't be afraid. Thanks. [SPITS] Ew! That tastes like-- I don't know what it tastes like. It's horrible. Who are you? [GRUNT] Who are you? Sun? [SNORES] Moon? [ENTHUSIASTIC GRUNT] You're Moon? Hi, Moon. It's just nice to meet you. Mm. I'm-- I don't seem to know who I am. Hm. [LAUGHS] Some sort of tribal custom? [GRUNT] I could get to like it. I don't remember a thing. Where am I? And, uh, how did I get here? Do you know? What is my name? It's Sunflower-- and Moon. OK, Doctor Flanken, let's just see how much progress you've made. [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING] VERONICA: I am Veronica. Well, Doctor Flanken, you are to be congratulated. I am Veronica. And you will pleasure me. And I will pleasure you. [FUNKY MUSIC] I can't believe you're not real. And I can't believe you're done already. Shh, just let me do one thing, and I'll be right back with you, OK? [ALARMS] [WHOOSHING] What's going on here? Chambers, what are you doing? I thought I heard a noise, and I thought I would just try to get the-- So you decided to strip naked, make love to a robot, and then investigate? Well, that program is designed to receive and transmit erotic materials so we can monitor all sexual trends as Veronica was being developed. Somehow you've placed her in the transmission field. Congratulations, Chambers. You've accidentally discovered naked time travel. [FUNKY MUSIC] [WHOOSHING] Doctor Flanken? I don't know what kind of test this is, but I like it. OK, sport, you kept telling me you were broke. And now I find this super model waiting to do the shoot with us! What gives? Uh, I didn't hire her. Well, you should have. What's your name, dear? Veronica. But I don't want to be the source of any conflict. It's not what I was made for. What were you made for? I was made for love and pleasure. Really? Can you show us? I'd rather not do it alone. [ROCK MUSIC] [CLICK] I found her. Felix-- uh, Dr. Franklin, I found Veronica. Where is she? Right here, and I'd say all her functions are working beautifully. What year is she trapped in? 1998. And she's somewhere in California. The '90s. Oh my god, that's the "Waterworld" decade. I'm afraid so. Well, can you get her back? I can't just yank her out of '98! She's positioned into the transmission beam, and we're the only ones who know the exact time and place it'll transport. Well, so we gotta go get her. Yes, that means naked time travel, doctor. Well, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not embarrassed. I'll do it for science. Yeah, yeah. I'll set the coordinates, then we'll strip. Oh my god, Max, I never knew. Neither did I. [INTENSE MUSIC] That's a great outfit. But don't you want to try the one being modeled by the other girl in the ad? I mean, she's hot too. I see. OK, just Veronica's Boudoir Bustier 20 of them? OK! The Pussycat Clubs have just started $5,000 worth of peignoirs-- and so have The Women's Republican Club of Iowa. MAN: Hey, hey, hey, look what we got here. I think you've created a monster, Harry. But you'll always be my favorite. [ROCK MUSIC] Did we please you? Please me? You guys were great! They almost tore the place down trying to throw money at me. I'm so happy that you're happy. Listen, I gotta get to the office and sort this out. Guys, I know it's been a long day, but could you give me a quick hand? Sure, our specialty. But what about me? Oh, thanks, Veronica. But these girls know how I got things set up. So, besides, you're the star of the show. You should out on the town celebrating. What's wrong? Don't tell me you're getting hung up on Harry. So? What's the final total? $43,686.47 worth of sexual bliss. $0.52. What? I double checked the figures in my head. $0.52. From the mouths of babes comes wisdom. I am a babe, even if certain people don't think so. You guys know I couldn't have done any of this without you. Yeah, you're a nice guy, Harry. Sometimes nice isn't a compliment. She's right. Hot babes still need to know that they're hot babes. I've always thought so, honest. Prove it. Uh, this is kind of sudden. I-- You've only had three years to get ready. Now, I'm going to go find a tube of jello something that strikes my fancy, and we're going to relax after a long day-- together. [ROCK MUSIC] Sex is so natural and fun. I don't understand why humans have such a problem with it. Dr. Flanken, if you could hear me, I wish you'd program the answer into my memory circuits. But I suppose you can't hear me. [SIGH] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYS] You are an amazingly talented lady. Gee, Harry, how many, uh, nude models do you need, anyway? What are you're talking about? Hey, we're getting kinkier and kinkier! I respect that. This is wonderful. Carbonated beverages have been outlawed for us for over 50 years. Oh, were you guys in some kind of cult? No. We come from the same place as Veronica-- 2030. BETTY: Another planet, right? She's spooky. MAN: Super cool! FELIX: What I don't understand is how she went from being a pleasure droid to making her own decisions about partners. Because I programmed her, remember? Why did you change it? I didn't. I just give her a hint of emotions. If something was to touch her heart, then other feelings would kick in. The point was to make a perfect mate. The perfect mate has feelings, lunkhead. Veronica, what touched you? He did 'cause I saw you with Billy and Betty. It's time for us to make our exit. Are we finished making adjustments? We are for now. Come on. Listen, I'm sorry about that. I don't know what happened. And they sort of took control. But I should have said no. It didn't mean anything to me. I know they could care less. I understand when it doesn't mean anything. But now I want it to. So do I. Are you really a robot? Yes. Cool. [SENSUAL MUSIC] I suppose we should work out the coordinates to return to the lab. I set the computer on continuous scan, so we can go back at almost any time you want-- if you really want to. Why not? Mm, I like this place. It's not at all in ruins, and everyone here isn't so desperate. I thought maybe we could take a little vacation in the 1990s, get to know each other better. Great anthropological value, doctor. I could stand a break. [LAUGHS] Oh. I hope you weren't in any big hurry to get back. I thought we might stick around for a while. Oh, that's great! I was hoping to tag along, maybe find some geek work in the future. But if y'all want to stay with me-- That'd please me very much. [TITLE MUSIC] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
