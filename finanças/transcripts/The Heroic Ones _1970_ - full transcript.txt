In the end of Tang Dynasty, bandit Wang Chung... prevailed and conquered capital city Chang An. Li Ke Yung, the leader of Shatuo, granted as... King Ching by Tang, was royal to Tang forever. Li led his troop heading east against Wang... gathered with 28 town leaders at Hezhong. Strong army of Li expected to defeat Wang. Please... Please... Boys, relax and enjoy the meal. Father, if we use this kind of cup to drink, I'll not be drinking at all. Right! Bring in our ox horn cup... and the good wine from Tian Shan... to serve our guest. They're all ready. Father, we're waiting for your order. Come on, brothers, let's bring the wine here. Go... Okay... Sir, this is the ox horn cup from Shatuo. If you don't finish the wine inside, you cannot rest the cup on table. Boys, pour wine for our guest. Yes. Try... Try... What a hero! You like to drink in this way too? You wouldn't miss the wine. Please... Please... 12th Brother, let's enjoy ourselves. Ching Szu, play your spear... for our guest's amusement. Father, it's no fun to play alone. I want someone to play with me. Skillful and experienced warriors are here. Whatever you like... Hey, you play with me. This is Chu Wen, warlord of Bianliang City. Arrogant barbarian, where're you from? I'm from Shatuo, sir. I didn't want to come here. We're asked by emperor's order. Sir, you're asked to defeat Wang. Your army has been in Hezhong for 10 days. But you guys only stayed here for fun. I've 100,000 soldiers, 500 guards... and 13 Generals, Wang is no match to us. I wouldn't stop having fun because of Wang. Will you play or not? Enemy is still there. But we're fighting now. - This is not good. Stop it! - Sir... A man called Meng Chieh Hai had led his army to fight us at West Gate, defeated a few warriors of our side already. Why do you guys remain silent? Why so scared when the enemies come? - Who's the Meng Chieh Hai? - He's the bravest warrior in Wang's army. King, you've 100,000 soldiers, 500 guards and 13 Generals. We'd like to see how you can defeat them. No need to catch a man with my army. Among my 13 boys, Chu may choose anyone of them. Then he can catch Meng alive. King... your sons and godsons are named 13 Generals. Why are there only 12 people here? Do you think I take the battle as nothing? My 13th Son is now guarding West City. It's reported that 13th General is... drinking all day and sleeping in castle now. Okay, I'd like this 13th General to catch Meng, okay? Let's go to the West City to watch the fight. We rely on him to catch Meng. Where's 13th General? He's leaning on the spear and sleeping. How can he be a general? I'd like to see how he'd catch Meng. Wild savage, your father's here. - What did you called me? - I called you wild savage. - How dare you beat up the officer? - Stop... He called me wild savage! You drunken! There's enemy outside the city. Why didn't you go to fight? Could people like you catch Meng? So... I'd bet with you with this jade belt. What do you use for the bet? My head! King, do you hear it? - There's no nonsense in the army. - Of course. - General, how many soldiers will you take? - Soldiers? I'll go alone. Give me a rope. No need to open the gate. I'm be back before lunch with Meng tied with this rope. Let's go back to Ya Guang Hall and wait. No matter Tsun Hsiao alone can win or not, he'll be back safe. - You and Shih Szu take 1,000 Black Crow soldiers to receive him. - Yes. Go! Quick! So he's Meng Chieh Hai? It's near noon now. 13th Brother will bring him back. King Ching, it's almost noon. King, General has caught Meng... and entered the city. 13th General has arrived. Father, I've caught Meng. He's down the hall. Officer Chu... Okay. Give me... Give me your jade belt. No way! Emperor gave me this. - I can't give away without reason. - Nonsense! Did I lose the bet? Can I refuse you by saying that my head was given by my parents? Give it to me. Though I only got most of it, it's alright. How dare you deprive of an officer's belt? I only got a half. I've given you face. Officer Chu, no nonsense in the army. That's what you said. Go! Tsun Hsiao, it's a merit to catch Meng. You're rewarded to drink 3 cups. Okay... Father, Chu Wen led his men back to his base. Just let him go. Come on... let's have fun and drink... Szu Yuan, how's the enemy? The enemies are bandits in origin... but occupying Changon. They've advantage. It's not easy to defeat them in short time. It's lucky Tsun Hsiao caught Meng alive... and lessened enemies excellence. Father, it's only a minor reward. I want to achieve a bigger one. What do you want? I'll break into Changon alone and take Wang back. Why laughing? Are you only one who can win? No fight between brothers! Father, 4th Brother is right. Changon is less than 200 miles from here. There're enemies on the roads. If we rest in days... and move on in nights, it's not possible to catch Wang, but we could agitate the bandits... and it won't be hard to defeat them. Good idea. Boys... Tsun Hsiao, Shih Szu... Tsun Shen, Tsun Chin... Tsun Chih, Shiu Li, Tsun Shou, Tsun Chang... - You don't have to go. - Father, it's my idea. You want to catch Wang alone. You will not obey orders from others. It'll create danger. You stay here. Father, I'll take orders from anyone. Tsun Hsiao will command. Will you obey? I'll. Okay, 9 of you leave now. Changon is dangerous. Be cautious. To agitate enemy only. No reckless action. Tsun Hsiao... Don't lose anyone when you're back. I got it. Waiter, get me some delicious food. Sir, it's been warfare there's no delicious food. With dough and tea one can still survive. What's dough? You're really good at telling gags, sir. Again what's gag? Is it a kind of food? Get us some food. We've to move on after meal. Right, we're going to Changon. Bullshit, we're going to Hanzhou. - Bring us the dough. - Yes. Here's the dough. Here comes the General... Please take a seat inside... General, please sit down... Waiter, it tastes awful. What's on that table? Get me some. Sir, please spare me. He's a general. - You cannot compared to him. - He's a general. We're also... Please... General, you're... Chang Kuan, Great General of Da Qi Emperor. Get lost! You bandits of Wang Chung... Is there any meat left? No, everyday when general comes around... and arrives here, we only cook a bowl of meat. General, there's no meat. What do you think? What do I think? I'll borrow 3 pounds of meats for barbecue. Don't hurt him. We need him as a guide. 13th Brother, good idea. Let's change into their clothes. Pick those with less blood. General... General Chang is back from patrol. Okay. Is there any news in the frontier? No. Chang, General Meng was caught alive by Li's 13th Son. - His army is heading for Hezhong. - Got it. Stop grunting! Yes. If you can bring us into the city, I'll let you go. - General Chang needs to enter the gate. - Yes. - Does he have a royal pass? - No. Look carefully who he is. Chang entering the gate without a royal pass... is a serious offense. I can't believe even like Chang Kuan, an important man of Wang, cannot go inside. If I realized it earlier, I'd dash inside. We've 9 people here. Rushing inside by force won't do any good. So should we go back like this? No way. We've to wait for the night. Quick. - Who are you? - 13 Generals of King Ching. How's it? 13 Generals. What happened, sir? Alarm! King is on Phoenix Tower to observe. You stay here. I go around to assassin him. If I make it, you take the tunnel as cover and leave here. You stay here. I go around. The reward will be his again. 4th Brother... Your Honor... Your Honor... Protected by the sky, he's not hurt. Close the every gate immediately and catch 13 Generals. Kill... kill... Soldiers outside and we don't know the ways, let's hide in the citizen's house. Don't be scared, little lady. We'd like to hide in your house. - Is there anyone else? - Who... who are you? I'm 13th General Li Tsun Hsiao. He's my 8th Brother. You're the one who caught Meng alive. The message passed on real fast. Yes, everyone in Changon knows. Follow me. Come on... Don't worry. My granddad is asleep. He's deaf. Even thunder can't wake him up. Thanks, Miss Yin. You've 9 people coming? I heard King Ching has led a troop of 100,000... to receive Emperor and cast away the enemy. Why is here only 9 people? The troop will be here soon. We're the precursor. What's the matter? 4th Brother? What are you going? Stop. What's the matter? Go there, quick! Among 9 of them, 2 ran away and 7 are here. They're in the city and will be caught soon. We're ordered to tighten defense. They've nowhere to run. Right... search... 4th and 11th Brothers always make trouble. If not because of them, we would have killed Wang. How can you leave here now? - We kill our way out the city by force. - Only 7 of you but thousand of enemies... Lady, do you have any idea? Yes, you all pretend to be hawkers. I ask granddad to bring you to the field in the north of this city... where's sparsely-populated. You could climb over the wall and leave. How are you? You don't want my vegetable anymore. Shit! What's the matter with you? My vegetable! How... Your Honor, we are not able to kill Wang in Changon... - and here to take the punishment. - Stand up! 7 of you entered enemy's heartland, they're scared when hearing your names. What should I ask for more? Tsun Hsin, Shiu Li... I sent 9 of you to Changon and listen to... Tsun Hsiao's order but you didn't listen. You return fruitlessly and full of nonsense. - Guard! - Yes! Cut their heads off outside. - Father! - No word of mercy from anyone! 13th Brother! To enter Changon was 4th Brother's idea. Now our troop is so reputed. 4th Brother has his contribution. It's the time we need talented people. I beg of you to forgive them. According to your advise, they are beaten up 30 times with army stick. If Tsun Hsiao didn't ask me for mercy, I wouldn't have forgiven you. Punishment now. Then you led 5,000 soldiers to battlefield... a complete victory or never for me again. Contribution. Father, information shows after Wang had been shot... by 13th Brother at the tower, he cannot eat and became upset, moved out of Changon and wandered around. Wang moved out of Changon. It's a good time to break them up. Sons! - Yes. - Everyone led your troop to chase them. Yes... Tsun Hsiao, Shih Szu, enter Changon and guard Emperor back there. Kill... Kill... Little Brother, what's the matter? - What's happened here? - King Ching's army re-seized Changon. Wang's army set fire before they left. Many places here have become ruined. Where's the lady living here with her granddad Rou? Granddad... Father... Re-seizing Changon, we shocked whole nation. Szu Yuan and others went to chase the enemies. Our Black Crow army is everywhere on both... sides of the river. Bianliang isn't far away. It's warlord Chu Wen who invited us to Bianliang for meeting. What do you think? I think Chu has bad intention. Still remember the betting with his belt? Well... he'll never forget. We just broke up a batch of enemy, stationed here and here reported to you. It's good for you to come. Chu invited me for a meeting. Shih Szu and Tsun Hsiao had trouble with him. I sent you to Bianliang to take a look. Yes. Sir, Li's troop is approaching here. Though he's a bandit-fighter, I'm afraid he may have bad intention. I've invited him to meet me here. See how he'll reply me. Li's 4th son Li Tsun Hsin and 12th son... Li Kang Chun are outside the city. Okay, if they come, they'll be on the hook. During the Wang's Rebellion, Emperor has no power to control the nation. If I get rid of Li Ke Yung, Tang Dynasty will be under my control. Open the gate and welcome Li and Kang entering the city. Yes. Generals, my lord will welcome you in person. - Uniform of Royal court is really excellent. - Thank you. Little Brother... Hero likes pretty women. These 8 girls, if you like, please take anyone of them back to your camp. Father won't like this idea. You guys had done a great work. This trivial thing is just nothing. What great work did we do? All great work was Li Tsun Hsiao's. There's no such thing. - 13 Generals have achieved great service. - Officer Chu, you don't know yet. Our father now... only favoured Tsun Hsiao and Shih Szu, claimed that major work of re-seize Changon belonged to them. Shih Szu was promoted as governor. Tsun Hsiao a warlord now. My 12th Brother and I are not yet summoned yet. How unfair! Hope you won't mind... Your Lord is too one-sided. Before father said Eldest Brother Szu Yuan is the best in strategy, 4th Brother toughest. After he adopted Shih Szu and I, he even didn't name us after his. Li Tsun Hsiao is the last to come, his original name is An Shih Szu, but father said he's the same name as 11th Brother, so named him Li Tsun Hsiao. If he's not one-sided, why can't we have the surname Li? Generals, don't feel upset. Let's drink and enjoy. Drink... When you leave, please say a few good words for me. If your lord and I get along well, I'm confident that the emperor will listen to me. I'll suggest promotion for both of you for warlords for big cities. Come on... cheers again. Thank you, Officer Chu. Generals... please ask your lord visit me here. Whatever you want, I'll make it happen. We understand. No need to see us off. Chu's army is here and has no fear of father. He wants to invite father to Bianliang. It's purely a peaceful invitation. I think he doesn't have bad intention. Father, when troops gathered at Hezhong, Chu had trouble with us. If you don't go this time, Chu will think that we're going to invade his land. Enemies aren't totally destroyed. We should avoid other troubles. So I'd better pay a visit. Tsun Hsin, Shiu Li... you go back to your camp first to watch out for the bandits. - I'll be going there with Shih Szu tomorrow. - Yes. Father... Chu still worries me. Please allow me to protect you. You've trouble with him before. No good. - Stay in the camp. - Father! The remaining bandits are at Bai Lin River, waiting for us to start the final battle. - You cannot leave the camp for any reason. - Yes. My Lord, it's Bridge Peace. I wish you victory very soon and peace throughout the nation. Thanks. - Why 11th General didn't drink? - If everyone is drunk... and here's not my own camp... there's nothing to fear in Bianliang. A hero should get drunk and sleep with women. Your lord has brave warriors. He'll be reputed for restoring the kingdom. Let's cheer for it. In this battle, my 13th son did most of the work. Yes, his bravery is highly greatly praised. Why don't I see him today? I'm afraid you still blamed him for the belt so I asked him to station at camp. Please... Please... Come on... cheers again... Great... Cheer again... Come on... cheers... If you didn't turn your back to the bandits, when Changon was restored, I'm afraid you'd be dead. Though you're bandit in origin, you turned a new leaf on time. I need your support, sir. Cheers... great... Once again. 11th General... Lord... Lord... He's drank. Please rest him inside. Once again... cheers... 11th General doesn't go to rest? One more... cheers... Excuse me... Don't go... You guys don't go... - Sir... - What's it? A savage after all. No protection at all. Li Ke Yung is asleep. Shih Szu and others are all drank. Is the rocket ready? Yes, it's ready. It's a pity that Li Tsun Hsiao isn't here. Rocket is fired and you guys rush in. The bastard Shih Szu is too hot to handle. No need to have a real fight with him. If you cannot kill him from behind, retreat to Bridge Peace. - That's where they make their back. - Yes. - Fire the rocket. - Yes. - These are the 12 of them. - Yes, they're the best fighters in our army. They're also good under water. Okay, the rest may retreat temporarily... - and hide under the bridge, waiting for Li. - Yes. There're still 20 more of your Blademen. They're my bodyguards. Don't use them unless it's emergency. Yes. Go. My Lord... My Lord... My Lord... My Lord is here. My Lord... - We'll go through Bridge Peace and kill our way out. - Yes. Go! Where's the fire? Looks like it's in Bianliang. Father is in trouble. Gather troop to help. But there'll be no commander in the camp. Bullshit! Saving him is the first priority. Shih Szu... Shih Szu, your belly is open. Run! I take care of the enemy. Shih Szu... - You go first, Father. I'll resist the enemy. - But you... I'm dead for sure. You go first... - Call the 20 Blademen to stop them under the wall. Go! - Yes. My Lord! 11th Brother! - Quick! - Yes. Swordmen! Chase... quick! Tsun Hsiao is resistible. If he ran away, - no need to chase. Ask everyone to retreat. - Yes. Order from the lord... No chasing, return quickly, close the gate. Shih Szu, my son... My Lord... Why covered his face? Let's me see it again. Shih Szu... You two useless fools! Double-crossed with Chu, killing my general. What punishment should it be? My Lord, don't be angry. We'll lead the troop to attack Bianliang City. Bullshit, he's a warlord of the kingdom, if you attack his city, I'll make a big mistake. Both of you get lost. I don't want to see you again. Tsun Hsiao you take 10,000 soldiers to the north of Bianliang... and set up war camp. I'll report to the emperor, accuse Chu of... murder and send troops to block his way. Yes. Give me wine. I need to pay respect to Shih Szu. 12th Brother... If things go on like this, we'll be dead for sure. It's best to seek asylum near Chu Wen's place. 4th Brother, you are, among us the best fighter and most rewarded one. Nowadays, the situations are not fair to you. It is all because of this guy Li Tsun Hsiao! We kill him first to dissolve the hatred. Anyways, Chu Wen hates him the most! After killing Li Tsun Hsiao we can then seek asylum to Chu Wen's place. If so, Chu Wen will certainly be happy! 4th Brother, My Lord has been drunk for Shih Ching Szu's death since last night. - We can falsify his command. - He won't be ignorant enough... - to believe what we are saying is true! - The King is drunk and lost conscious... if we could steal his sword on his waist, Tsun Hsiao would not resist... if we can deceive him to enter our camp, we'll have control over him! Yes, we'll wait till tonight and take action! - What's the matter with the King? - From yesterday till today he woke up 3 times. - When he is awake, he orders us to bring wine. - Take me to see the King! My Lord! I am back from the patrol and have some report to let you know. Bring the wine to me! Ching Szu died in a bloody battle! Tsun Hsin and Shiu Li are useless, execute them. Ching Szu, you such a courageous Commander! 4th Brother, 12th Brother... Is there any urgent military situation? 4th Brother, what's it? 13th Brother, do you recognize this sword? - This is the King's sword! - Yes, you are right! The King is indignant and is to question you... and he has specially sent us two here. - A matter hard to deal with! - What did I offend him? You left the camp and didn't follow the order. Bianliang is on fire. I've to save the King. But after 11th Brother was killed, we were always in drunken state. It's hard to explain! If you just go, everything would be alright. - Then I will do so. - 13th Brother, please set out immediately! 13th Brother, the King has orders us to come and please don't mind us saying this. You've the King's favor and trust unduly... he is just indignant now. But if we don't tie you up to see him, he might truly be mad and asks for our sin, we truly can't afford to take this sin! Fine! Please do so! We need to tie you up tightly, forgive us! 4th Brother, why tie me up in this manner? Why are you tying me up here and not letting me go and see the King? King's sword is here. He asked me to do it! My King wants to take my life? King ordered us to tie you up here and wait for the penalty. 13th Brother, put up with it for a while, wait till the King is awake from the alcohol! Let me go and see my King! He is drunk. Going now will only worsen it! Everyone knows you're courageous! But if you offend him, we cannot help you! This is only way to prove your faithfulness! You are originally a shepherd, but by luck became in one of the 13 Generals. You compete merit with us in all respects, making us always endure blames! What do you have to say to this? You! It's not the King who wants me! Even if you found out now, it's too late! - Is my King there? - King hasn't awakened from the alcohol yet. Today all brothers returned in victory... why do I not see Tsun Hsiao? 11th Brother died in Bianliang City. - What is this about? - We'll talk about this after seeing the King. - Alright! - Eldest General... 4th General allured 13th General to the camp and is hacking him into pieces! - What nonsense are you talking about? - We risk our life to report! - Please try to save 13th General! - What is going on here? My Lord, report from 4th brother's camp says 13th Brother was allured to go there... - and being hacked into pieces. - Quick, get my sword... - Where is my sword? - 4th Brother was in the camp before... Must be him who stole the sword, falsifying your command, and deceiving 13th Brother to go to his camp. - Get the horses ready! - Yes! - My children, go quickly! - Yes! Everybody listens! 12th Brother and I are to leave this place to seek asylum at Chu Wen's in Bianliang... who is with us? Let's go! Tsun Hsiao! - Where did they go? - They headed to Chu Wen's place in Bianliang. Send my order to prepare the army and heading for Bianliang! My Lord, we 13 brothers followed you to the battlefield all around, now we brothers unexpectedly have to kill each other! They must have not gone too far! This is between us brothers. My Lord, please let we 9 brothers follow and cease them back! Alright! If they refuse to come back, let me handle the situation. If not... If not... Take their lives right at the spot! Yes! Brothers! Let's go! Yes, Big Brother! Let's move fast! It is only him... Big Brother! 4th Brother... 12th Brother... Whose idea is this supposed to be? Big Brother, what are you trying to say? Harming 13th Brother, killing among brothers. Whose idea is this? Big Brother, what do you mean by this? Go back with me for the King's punishment! Big Brother, stop the wishful thinking! 4th Brother, stop forcing us to once again take own brother's life! Step back, this is between us brothers! - Big Brother, Big Brother! Spare my life! - If he admits guilty, no need to kill him. 4th Brother! 12th Brother, don't you still surrender? 13 Generals. 13 Brothers.
