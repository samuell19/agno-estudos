It's so icy cold! Waterfall! So icy cold! No! Stop it! Look at those cascades! Fantastic! I've touched it for the first time! I had ever touched it before. You stupid liar! Liar! Liar! I had touched it in my dream, though. Stop it! Take it! No way, it's bad. - We should go back right now. - Was it mom? Ayumi! It's about to start. We should go back. Here they come. What were you guys doing? It's already started. Misaki ... Misaki was 44, right? She died young. She hadn't been feeling well. It can't be helped. She was a great kid. She had good grades, a real class act. Translation: neet21_ Time/Caption: ECOTVSub These subtitles may contain inaccuracies and grammar mistakes (Yawata-cho, Shiroishi City, Miyagi Prefecture) Is it ... your mom's last letter? Yes. (To Ayumi) I haven't ... looked yet. I'm afraid to open it. When did she take this photo? When she was a college student. We don't have any recent photos of her. They two really look so much alike. They're a mother and a daughter, though. It's like she was reincarnated. So much alike. Mom. Yes? Can I stay here for a few more days? I can at least give Ayumi something to talk about. Please, I'm begging you. Is that okay with you? I think it's okay. I'd like her to stay, too You would? It's settled then. Yay! Thank you! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Is that really okay? Grandma! Grandpa! I'm going to stay here! Grandma! I'm going to stay here for a few days. You are? That's nice, enjoy yourself here. Yay! You can stay here until the summer break ends. Mom, is that really okay? - Of course. - Great! That's a blessing, the stupid bugger's gone. - Don't run. - Don't come any closer. Take care. - Bye. - Be a good boy. Bye. Auntie, wait! This ... This came for my mom. I don't know what to do with it. It's an invitation to an alumni reunion. Reunion? Nakatagai High School. This brings back memories. Let me deal with it. (Izumi-ku, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture) Bye! Bye! (Yuri: We're back) I'm back. Welcome back. How's your work? Any progress? Thanks to you, I might be able to make it. I'm sorry I couldn't be there with you. It's okay. Soyoka's going to stay over at my parents'. She's going to be there for a few days. She said she wanted to be with Ayumi for a while. She was the one who brought it up. She was? She's grown up all of a sudden before we even know it. Seems so. Spill the salt. Have you done it? Ah no, I forgot. Eito, come here for a minute. If you don't do it outside, the bad stuff will come in. - Is it? - Yeah. Bad stuff? You know, phantoms, spirits, stuff like that. Stuff your dad is good at. Oh, you mean ghosts? - Yes. - And monsters? Okay, let's do it. Sprinkle it on the chest first. Then on the back. Heave, ho! It's not fair. You do this every day and you're already a pro. It's so hot. I'm so tired. Let's have a nice talk tomorrow. What's that? - All right. - Great. Good night. Wow, this is quite a turnout. I did a lot of work to make them come. But, there were still lots of people I couldn't reach. Do you remember Misaki? The student council president, Tono Misaki? Yes, I have no idea where she is right now. Oh, really? Misaki! It's been a while. We were just talking about you. I was so worried I couldn't reach you. This reunion won't be complete without you. No, you guys are wrong. We are not. You were the only goddess of our generation. There was no one but you. Come on, smile. So now, I will pass the mic to the next speaker. She was the greatest goddess who stole all the boys' hearts. Tono Misaki. Hi mates, it's been a long time. Hello. High school means a lot to me. It was full of unforgettable memories. Being on a stage like this ... talking into a microphone ... standing in front of so many people, the first time I've done this again since high school. So tonight ... I hope everyone here has a great time. What's wrong? Are you nervous? Sorry for the bad speech. Nakatagai High School built new buildings three years ago. And the old ones will be demolished soon. So, I took some photos for me to archive. I will show a few of them to you. I have to go right now. Why so early? I live kind of far away. Thanks for having me. See you next time. I had done some searching in all the closets. And found audiotapes of your graduation ceremony. Okay. Let's have a listen. Today we celebrate our graduation day. High school was a very special time that will probably be lifelong memories for all of us. It will be priceless memories for us. If you ask what my future dream and goal are I haven't come up with anything myself yet. Even so, that's fine. Because our future has limitless possibilities. We have countless options in our lives. Each and every one of our graduates here present and future will live their own unique lives. Some of us will live their dreams and some others might not. When you have a bad day when life gets hard we will always remember this place. The place where we had limitless dreams and possibilities. The place where we were equals, prestigious, and shone with great dignity. Graduate Student Representative, Tono Misaki. Hi! Hi! Do you remember me? I do! Long time no see. How are you? Long time no see. I didn't get a chance to greet you earlier. That's why I came after you. I'm sorry, I didn't greet you either. That's okay. I'd like to talk with you about something. Let's get a place to talk and have some drinks there. I can't, I should get going right now. I see. Then ... Can I have your contact? Okay. Done. Mama? You're a mom of two kids now? Yes, I'm sorry about that. This is ... my card. You are a novelist, cool! No, not cool at all. What kind of books do you write? That's a long story. Why don't we have one sip of drinks? The bus is coming. Did you ... Did you read the novel? What novel? You forgot? What I forgot? I won't tell you. What's that? I'm curious. I'll tell you next time. See you. I had a nice time today. If you're curious, don't bother to contact me anytime. Okay. Would you believe me if I tell you I still love you? Stop making fun of an old lady, please. I'm back. I'm back. Welcome back. Look at this mess. Eito. Get this over with. Don't give me that response. I'm back. You are back. How was it? That was such a big deal. They thought I was my sister. Why? It's been 25 years, hasn't it? I don't think there's any trace of high school left. Everyone's all grown old. Some have gone bald, gotten fat. Got a lot of makeup on and some even had plastic surgery. But did you tell them about your sister? I didn't have the chance. I was forced to make a speech right after I arrived. So, I pretended to be my sister. Then what's the point of attending that event? I know, you don't have to tell me. (Otosaka Kyoshiro: I've been in love with you for 25 years) What's going on? Are you okay? (Otosaka Kyoshiro: I've been in love with you for 25 years) I'm okay. What's wrong? Can you explain this to me? What is it? The man named Otosaka, who the hell is he? He was my senior. “I've been in love with you for 25 years.” What the hell is this? Didn't I tell you they've mistaken me for my sister? Why didn't you explain it to them? I said I didn't get any chance. What chance? What kind of chat is this? “Stop making fun of an old lady, please.” Don't read it out loud. No cell phones! What should I do? Eito, go to bed! (Dad broke mom's phone) What's wrong? My parents are fighting. Dear Otosaka Kyoshiro. Did you send me any messages since then? My husband has misunderstood us. He broke my phone. If you sent me any messages (Kamiochiai, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo To: Otosaka Kyoshiro) I'm really sorry, I couldn't read it. I just wanted to tell you that. (Kamiochiai, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo) I'm sorry for the one-way latter. You don't have to write back. I was writing this letter without putting the return address. I'm sorry. (Tono Misaki) The novel you mentioned last time, what is it about? I really can't remember. You have to tell me the next time we meet. And please forgive my poor writing. Take care, see you soon. Tono Misaki. I've done something bad, haven't I? I'm bacー Why there are dogs here? They are cute, aren't they? No, that's not what I mean. Why you brought them in? I'm going to draw a comic about dogs next. So, I bought dogs for the source material. You bought two dogs just for source material? Yes. Who's gonna take care of them, anyway? You're gonna do it. Ayumi! Ayumi! Ayumi! They got dogs! They got dogs! Take a look at them! Take a look at these dogs. They are so cute. I didn't know such a big dog actually existed. Sensei! I've written it up this far, could you please check it out? Okay. (Tono Misaki) Dear Otosaka Kyoshiro. My husband brought home two big dogs. He wanted me to take care of them. That's probably a punishment. Although I'm not blaming you I just thought you should know. I'm sorry, I might not be able to write you any more letters. Please consider this letter as if you didn't receive it. You okay, mom? Just give me a second. Mom, hurry up! Hello. It's Akiko. Ah, It's you, mom. I will open the door right now. Grandma's here. I'm coming in. Welcome. It's really hot today. It is. Grandma, what brings you here? I had business nearby. Ah, Eito. You've grown taller, haven't you? It's been a while since the last time we met, please come in. Thank you for having me. Where's Soujiro? He's upstairs? Yes. Hurry, tidy up your stuff. Excuse me. Why there are dogs here? Dad bought them. This is Boru, and this is Zoe. Wait a minute. I'll get them out of here. It's okay. They're coming over here, scary, scary. It's gonna hurt their necks if you tighten the leashes up. One moment, please. Excuse me. Come on. This way. This way. Honey, your mom's here. I bought you guys presents. This is yours and this is Soyoka's. Where is Soyoka? She's currently staying at my parents'. Ah, I see. Then let's all eat this together. Thank you so much. Eito! What brings you here today? I attended an alumni reunion nearby. Alumni reunion? Yeah, a high school reunion. Yuri also attended a high school reunion a couple of days ago. Was she? Did you meet your first love? No, I didn't, there was no such person. What about you? Did you meet your first love? What are you talking about? Re-un-ion. No, I didn't. Mom. Yes? I'd love you to stay here. You can stay here for a week if you want. I'll take you up on your offer if you say so. It's such a big dog, isn't it? You can call it, Zoe. I'll get it. I'm home. Such a big dog! There's one more at home. Wait. How long do you want me to take care of it? Um ... It's not going to stay here forever, is it? Um ... You really brought it here because you want me to take care of it forever, don't you? I just can't! I've already got my hands full here. What am I supposed to do? Nothing came to my mind expect to take them to the Animal Health Care Center. I'll look after the dog. Will you? I'll help, too. Soyoka! You're going home after the summer break ends, aren't you? Dear Otosaka Kyoshiro. Since I went back to my hometown I made a quick visit to our high school. Go run! It doesn't even look like you're running. Soyoka, over here. Run! Run! All right, let's go. Let's go. Lots of fallen leaves to step on. It doesn't feel like it's changed at all. Take some photos of me. As I was walking around the grounds and the school buildings I remembered all sorts of memories. We'll be going first. Thanks for today. I've enclosed some photos. Tono Misaki. Dear Tono Misaki. I don't know how to express my sympathy on this occasion. Nothing I can say will make you feel any better. I guess it's my fault that you're in hard situation, isn't it? I'm always here for you if you want to talk. But, having some fun writing letters like this is nice, isn't it? (Nakatagai High School's Yearbook) (Tono Misaki, 989-0249, Shiraishi City, Miyagi Prefecture 2-15-3) This is your hometown address, isn't it? Will you receive this letter if I send it to this address? Otosaka Kyoshiro. Where's Grandma? She went out. Where? I don't know. You must not let her go out alone. She will be okay, she's not a kid anymore. She's an older adult, so things tend to get a little hazy, don't they? You mean she has Alzheimer's? That's not what I mean. Where does she go? Shall we go look for her together? Sheepdogs are more reliable, though. Even so, you'll have to train them. It's so hot, I can't stand it any longer. My feet are swollen. She's here, found her! So, your son is a cartoonist? He is. Bravo, Boru! Great job! How much should I put in? It's amazing, I had no idea that old people fall in love. So, that's what it's called love in the time of twilight, isn't it? What? What's love in twilight? Love in the time of twilight isー Nothing happens between them. They might be just friends. They're coming. They're coming. Get back, hide! You know, those spirits and stuff I'm not supposed to feel it but I still can feel it somehow. Wait! This is bad! Some of the maple's leaves turn red so fast this time, don't they? That's nice. They all will be completely turned red this December. Shall we sneak up behind them? We shall not. You guys stay right here. We shall visit the shrine instead. Eito, take care of Boru for a second. Hold it. No way. Here you go. Why do we have to worship now? Because we already are at the shrine. Is this what they call an adult's concern? All right, come on. Here's my share. All right, go inside the shrine. We're not following you! Let's go, Boru. Let's go. It's such a hell of a hill. Where are we now? Let's rush in and do a surprise inspection. Let's do it! No, don't do that! Let's see what's in the mailbox. There's a letter for my mom. Who sent it? Absolutely nothing happens. Zero chance of any case. Shall we go back? Yeah, let's go back. Let's go back. So boring. Eito, let's go playing games instead. Come on, Boru. Wait up! Go get something to drink. It's hot as hell. We need to stay hydrated. Don't buy anything extra, okay? Okay. Don't tell anyone what we saw today, okay? It's hush money, isn't it? It's not, why do you always get it wrong? All right, be safe. I know, it's hush money. Hush money! Yes, okay. Mom, are you okay? It hurts. You know her? I'm her daughter. Ah, no. I'm her daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law? Please take care of the rest. Take this with you. All right, go with them. Mrs. Kishibeno, please come in. Okay. Please come in. Have a seat. She has a lumbar disc disease. Well, that's what they call a sprained back. Sprained back? Yeah. That's a relief! She looked like she was in so much pain. I thought it was something serious. It's gonna hurt for a while, though. Dear Tono Misaki. I don't know how to express my sympathy on this occasion. Nothing I can say will make you feel any better. I guess it's my fault that you're in hard situation, isn't it? I'm always here for you if you want to talk. But, having some fun writing letters like this is nice, isn't it? Has he been writing to the dead? He says the death of your mom is his fault. Does it mean he killed your mom? But he's making it out as if it's nothing. This is your hometown address, isn't it? Will you receive this letter if I send it to this address? Otosaka Kyoshiro? Who is he? Does he not know your mom has passed away? Why don't we ask my mom? No, hold on. Don't you think it will be boring and meaningless? Why don't we write back? That's exactly what I was just thinking about. - Is it? - Yeah! Let's write it! What to write? Grandma! Do you have any letterhead? What is it? Letterhead. Letterhead? Let me check it. Are you Otosaka? Yes. You have one more letter here. Thank you. Dear Otosaka Kyoshiro. How much do you remember about me? You can send me any letters to this address. Tono Misaki. He sent us a letter! We've got a reply! Dear Tono Misaki. How much I remember about you as clearly as yesterday. More precisely, I remember it clearer than yesterday. I had been transferred to that school in June of my senior year. And I was there for less than a year, but those days are memories I will never forget. Students, I'd like to introduce someone to you. We've got a new classmate today. This is Otosaka Kyoshiro. I'm Otosaka Kyoshiro. I hope we can become friends. Let's see, your seat is over there. Okay. My seat was at the back next to the window. It was away from the other boys and behind the girls. It was really an awkward place to be. At that desperate situation Yaegashi, the boy closest to my seat asked me to join him. He asked me to join the biology club. Thanks for having me. Tono, introduce yourself to the new member. Hello, I'm Tono. This is the newest member of the club, Otosaka Kyoshiro. I'm Otosaka. I'm Tono Yuri. That was the first time I met Yuri. Dear Otosaka Kyoshiro. My mother-in-law's suddenly got a sprained back. She was rushed to the hospital by an ambulance from her boyfriend's house. She didn't ever mention that man. So, I've never asked her anything. It was super awkward. Do you want something? I'm okay. Hold on a second. Ouch, ouch. Can you mail this letter for me? Ouch, it hurts. Leave it to me. Since she can't move, she asked me to mail her letter. It must be a love letter. Older adults use letters to communicate, don't they? I'm getting used to writing letters, too. It's all thanks to you. Hello. Here's a letter for you. Thank you. We've got a letter! Dear Tono Misaki. We biology club members would go to the nearby irrigation ditch after school looking for stoneflies and planktons. I had no idea what was so exciting about that. But it's now a nostalgic memory that worth cherishing to look back. You know, my sister is the student council president. Is she? That's cool. Not cool at all. It's dull. Why? I'm sick of being compared to her all the time. I've never been able to do anything better than her. I understand. Epidemic influenza was rampant at school at that time. I've decided to actively participate in community volunteer activities. She's the student council president, isn't she? Yes. Is she Yuri's sister? Yes, she is. I know it well you're busy with your studies and club activities but it's a great way to make new friends and discover new things. Let's try it again. Okay. What does your sister look like? Why do you ask? That's just because she always has the mask on. Do you like my sister? No, not that. It's just that I've never seen her face. We have some photos of her at my place. My place is nearby. Want to come over and take a look at them? Let's go. Here it is. This is my sister. That's me when I was three. This is when I was at kindergarten. This is the recent photo of my sister. It's kind of fuzzy, isn't it? It's fuzzier now. Would you like to eat some watermelon? I will get them! My sister will be back in a minute. I'll have her meet you when she gets back. That's not necessary. We should get back now. Your sister's back, isn't she? Not yet. Eat up. Thanks. Do you want some barley tea? I'll go get it. We have to go. It's still club time now. Thanks for this. Sis! Yuri, what are you doing here? Ah, he is ... He is my senior, Otosaka. He's a member of the biology club. He has been transferred to our school recently. Are you two having a nice date right now? You get it wrong! She gets it wrong, doesn't she? We're doing a club activity now. Club activity. What's your name? I'm Otosaka. Nice to meet you. I'm Yuri's sister, Misaki. You should take your mask off when introducing yourself. I'm Tono Misaki. See you again at school tomorrow. See you. She is beautiful, isn't she? I could be biased as a sister to say that, though. Yes, as you say, she's beautiful. Well, why don't ... why don't you write her love letter? Love letter. I can help you deliver it to her. I don't think it will work. Love letters are still a little ... Dear Tono Misaki. I'm Otosaka Kyoshiro, whom you met the other day with your sister. I'm indebted to Yuri for looking after me. Since I was just transferred to this school, I still has a lot to learn. There's a lot of things I don't know about this school and this city. I'd be very grateful to learn all I can about it from you. I would appreciate your help in this matter. I wrote a letter to your sister. (Otosaka Kyoshiro Class 3-4) (Tono Misaki) I had been writing you love letters afterward. That's how I started writing love letters to you. I've already written a lot. Until the next time. I want to know what happened next. Coming. Sorry to bother you. Thank you for the other day. I heard Mrs. Kishibeno's got a sprained back. Yes, she has. Sorry, did you get her letter? I was worried that you haven't replied yet. I'm sorry I made you worried. When I called an ambulance, I slipped down and hurt my hand. I can't move my hand. It must be hurt. I think it's inappropriate to talk at the door. Come in. Here, come on in. Okay. Excuse me. Mont St. Michel is either a small island that located at the Gulf of Saint-Malo, off the west coast of France, or the nunnery on it. What? Does it really say that? I'll have to send her a corrected copy. What is it? She's still learning English? I used to teach English at the high school. I met some of the alumni before. They all joked about wanting to take my class again. I got carried away and told them to come whenever they want. I was surprised Mrs. Kishibeno actually came. What's the point of learning English at this late stage of life? I wanted to write back. But I couldn't with my hand like this. Underline “either” right there. Done. It should say “both.” And correct the conjunction, change “or” to “and.” Change “or” to “and.” If it's “either/or” then it means ... “Mont St. Michel is ... ... either a small island or a monastery.” So, it's an either/or situation, isn't it? Then underline “nunnery.” I see. This is so fun. She must have enjoyed this kind of time with you. I guess so. Come in. I have a letter for you. Leave it here. Here it is. (Kishibeno Akiko) Thank you. Excuse me, Yumi is here. Come in. You didn't lock your door. Dear Hatoba Shozo Sensei. Thank you for your concern. Now, please correct the following paragraphs in English. This time she wrote about Palace of Versailles. - Hello, Sir. - I have a letter for you. Thanks. Ayumi, we've got another reply. Dear Tono Misaki. I wrote so many letters to you and then entrusted it to Yuri. I wonder how many letters I give her? Dear Otosaka Kyoshiro. Do you remember my sister? Her name was Yuri. She didn't really stand out. You probably don't remember her. There was a guy in high school that I had a crush on. But he liked my sister. He even wrote my sister love letters and then he'd ask me to deliver them to my sister. Don't you think that's outrageous? Sensei, may I ... Sensei, may I use your address? Sensei! Yes. Is it okay if I use your address? Sure, no problem. You don't have to write back. But if you do want to, you can send it to this address. When the mood strikes, please write me back. Tono Misaki. Dear Tono Misaki. First love is a frightening​ thing. It was a feeling of insecurity and anxiety, almost like fear. As if the earth revolved around you. Your gravitational pulled me in. All I could think about was you day after day. Dear Tono Misaki. Looks like you're finally over your cold. Congratulations on your recovery. (Natsume Soseki's Complete Collection) My hobby is reading books. Natsume Soseki's books are my favorite. What kind of books do you like? How's your sister doing? Has she gotten married yet? Does she have kids? And you? How are you? Coming. Hi! How did you get here? You gave me this address. Isn't this your home? This place belongs to the acquaintance of someone I know. Can you wait here for a minute, please? Okay. Oh no! I don't bring anything with me. What's going on? He's here. Who? My first love is here. But I didn't bring my makeup kit or anything. Seems I have lipstick Mrs. Kishibeno left here. If I remember correctly I saved it in here. Here, you can use it. Thanks. But why did she leave her lipstick here? Oh man, it looks so outdated. Well, maybe it's not so bad. - Sorry for keeping you waiting. - That's okay. What do we do now? There's a park over there. Let's have a talk there, shall we? You guys can talk here. You shouldn't be seen talking in the public eye. I want to go out for a walk. Thank you. Excuse me. Would you like something to drink? No, I'm okay. Did you read all the letters? I did, I've always enjoyed reading them. I'm sorry for every letter. It's just a bunch of boring housewife stuff. This is where you wrote the letters. Don't look at it! Don't look at it! You must not read these. Sorry. Thank you for the tea. The book you mentioned before. I can't remember it. What's the book again? It's a novel I wrote. It's called “Misaki.” Misaki? It's a novel about a girl modeled after you. I don't think you'll forget, but ... You are Yuri, aren't you? I'm sorry, I knew that from the beginning. I noticed it the moment I saw you at the reunion. How come no one has noticed? You knew and pretended you didn't know. You should have told me. Where's Misaki? Where is she now? Back in your hometown? My sister ... passed away. When? She passed away last month. At the end of July. I went to the reunion to tell everyone the news. But I just couldn't find the right time to say it. I went back home without saying a single word. How did she pass away? She couldn't stand the pain. She committed suicide. We've decided to tell others she dead by illness. I see. Do we have to hide it? I don't know either. I used to date your sister. I dated her when we were in college. I see, you had dated her. I had dated her and ... that's when I wrote the novel about her. It's a novel titled, “Misaki.” It won a prestigious award. I thought I'd be able to write another novel again. I had tried to write it ever since. But I found myself trapped in the past with my memories of her. And then I realized ... that was a real bummer. It was all about her. I just kept getting the same old story. That's all I've written so far. The only book ... I've ever had published is Misaki. The novel I'm working on now ... is also a story about Misaki. I wished she'd read it. So, I thought I'd stop writing once she did. I had no idea about any of this. After my sister went off to college she and I kind of drifted apart. When she was still at college ... she ran off with his lover and got married. She married Ato? Ato Yuichi? You know him? I knew him a little at college. I have no idea what he's doing now. I didn't know anything about his background either. He didn't have a job. And he seemed to be living off his sister. He was abusive. But my sister was the kind of person who wouldn't tell us things like that. Ayumi came to our place one day. She is my sister's only daughter. Her face was all swollen and her eyes purpled. I got scared, so I asked her what happened. She said she wanted me to save her mother. At first, I thought it was just a marital quarrel. When we got to their place. My sister was all haggard, she was beaten up so badly. And her husband just let us in as if nothing had happened. And said, “We're out of tea” and then he left. And I haven't seen him since. What? There's no news, and we don't know where he is now. My sister ... My sister's life was ruined by that man. She couldn't heal the wound in her heart. She tried to slit her wrists repeatedly. She had done a suicide attempt many times. The last time was on a mountainside. I can't regret it enough. If only she'd married you ... Are you going back to Tokyo? No, there are a few places I want to visit. - To collect some source materials? - Yes. I want to see where Misaki used to live. But no one lives there anymore. I don't know whether the building itself exists or not. Do you know where it is? You have the address, don't you? I do, it's at North First Street, isn't it? Yes. I know where is it. I had sent her a letter before. Do you still have a printed copy of your novel? It's already out of print. I don't think it's available for purchase, but ... If you'd like to read it ... please do. Thank you. My sister has gone to the other side but I hope you'll keep her story alive. When writing those letters pretending to be my sister made it seem like my sister's life was still going on. If someone keeps thinking about the deceased, it's as if they're still alive, isn't it? Yeah, maybe so. MISAKI Novel by Otosaka Kyoshiro It was a vivid reminder of the pain of my youth, this work was so endearing. - Kawakami Fuyuki What do you like about my sister? What I like about her ... There's plenty. Why don't you try to write it? You can just write, “I like this and that about you.” In short, say what do you really like about her. Isn't what I've written enough? Yet, it's not enough. You read my letters? I didn't. Then how do you know? I didn't read them, it's just ... my sister read them out loud, and I heard it by chance. So, you can't blame that on me. Your sister is too much to handle. But it's okay. I forgive her. I will forgive her for whatever she does. You must really like her. You okay? I can't take it anymore. You caught a cold, this is bad. Why don't you take a rest today? I've got to attend a student council meeting later. Can you take my place? Okay. Hello. Hello. I'm filling in for Yaegashi today. He's caught a cold. Has he? Seems lots of students caught a cold. It's not because of me, is it? Can you help me set the table, please? - Okay. - Thank you. Let's put this one in the middle. And that one too. Sorry ... What? Have you ... Have you read the letters? Letters? What letters? Forget it. Where are my letters? You never gave them to your sister, did you? She doesn't know anything. Are you playing with me? No, I'm not. Then why did you do it? I already gave your letters to her yesterday. My sister ... My sister wanted to tell you the truth. Your sister wrote this? No, I ... I like you Please go out with me Tono Yuri I'm sorry. I didn't know. That's fine. So, this is the place. As I expected. Has anyone lived here yet? I'm sorry. No, it's okay. What are you doing? I'm sorry. My friend used to live here. Your friend's name is Misaki? You know her? No, not really, she's my husband's ex-wife. And who your husband is? Ato. Ato? Ato Yuichi? Yes, he is. Does he live here now? Yes, he does live here. How long has he been living here? How long? I don't know either. Hasn't he been here since a long time ago? I've only been here for about a year, though. He's gone to work now. I'll contact him for you. No, no need to ... Why don't you come in. It's hot outside, isn't it? Excuse me. He's replied. “Who?” I forgot, what's your name? Otosaka. Oto from kanji Otsu and Saka from kanji Sakamichi. I type it in hiragana characters. That's okay. Just wait a minute. He will be back soon. What do you do? I write novels, but they don't sell well. You are a novelist? That's cool. No, not at all. You're the author of this book? Yes, I'm. May I ask you something? Does Ato always lose his temper? Is he that selfish? He's indeed a temperamental and selfish person. You know that, don't you? Is he? He's asking you to go out for a drink. I work there. You do? I'll get going now. But don't let him drink too much. Because he's a real pain in the ass when he's drunk. Welcome. Long time no see. How are you? What brings you here? Nothing. You're here to pick up some fodder for your novel. I'm right, aren't I? What do you want to drink? Want a beer to start? Okay. - Sir! - Yes? I order a draft beer and a shot of plum cocktail, please. Okay. Draft beer and a shot of plum cocktail, please! I haven't seen you in eons. It's been 20 years, though. How'd you find my place? I once got a New Year's card from Misaki. Your address was written on it. I see. I didn't think you were still living there. I was so surprised. I've got nowhere to go. Here we are. That was too fast. You just made it a second ago. You have to stir it with chopsticks to make a foamy beer. It's the fact. Come on, cheers. Cheers! You didn't actually come to see me, did you? You came to see her. When the door open you were surprised to see a woman you don't know, weren't you? Haven't you heard? Misaki ... She passed away. Last month. She committed suicide. You were ... You were not a student at our school. Who the hell are you? What is it? You act as if her death is my fault. So, it's not your fault? It's not. Even if it's my fault ... it has nothing to do with you. You know ... you had no influence on her life at all. Do you think ... she'd live a happy life if you married her? You're just another failed novelist who could only write one title book and couldn't even sell a single of it yourself. It's only because she dumped you that you were able to write it. If you hadn't been dumped, that novel wouldn't even exist in your life. Which means that novel was a gift from me and her to you. It was a great gift for your life. Wasn't it? She was such a boring woman. Always looked at me with fear in her eyes. Sometimes I couldn't help but hit her. We have a daughter named Ayumi. She always looked at me mockingly with an innocent look in her eyes. Whenever she looked at me with those eyes I just felt like I was ... a dirty, filthy, inhuman bastard. Is that really a place where I was supposed to go back? “Get out of here!” I just wanted to get out of my house. I ended up running away from my own life. I went to frolic around for a while. And then I came back home a month later. No one was there. My house was empty. You just asked me, didn't you? What was it again? “Who the hell are you?” I once longed for a name. But I've turned myself from a nobody into a loser. I'm neither a good husband nor a good father. I don't have a decent job either. And blames everything on everyone else. It's interesting, isn't it? Go back and write it down, man. Write a sequel. But this time you won't have a part. This time you won't be writing in the first person, okay? You see, a person's life ... doesn't just fit into your stupid thin book. Summer break is almost over. Come back next time. Sure. I still ... Yes? I still want to stay here with you ... for a little while longer. I'd like to stay with you for a little while longer. What about school? It'd be good if I could be transferred to your school here. What do you think? I'd be glad if you really did so, but ... Are you ... Are you worried about me? Yes, maybe I am. Don't be like this. You don't have to worry about me at all. Your worries, on the contrary ... it will be a burden for me, won't it? I mean, of course, it's been fun having you around. But you could come and visit when you're free by the weekends. And you can come to play with me. I don't want to go to school. Can you autograph this book for me? Thank you. Is this book good? I don't know, either. I'll read it. Want to come in? No, thanks. - It's so hot. - It sure is. Wait up! Sorry ... Are you guys ... Are you Mr. Kyoshiro? Are you Mr. Otosaka Kyoshiro? Yes. I'm Ayumi, Tono Misaki's daughter. - Who wrote those letters? -Yeah. You're the one who wrote those letters? Cool! I never thought we'd see you here. I'm Yuri's daughter, my name is Soyoka. You two look so much like them. I didn't think I would see you two here. But ... how do you guys know about me? I wrote letters to you on behalf of my mom. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I see. So, it's been you two. The truth is ... It's about my mom. I've heard about Misaki. Yuri told me. My mom? May I have a few minutes of your time? Why don't you come over to my place? I'd like you to pay respect to my mom. Please come in. No one at home? Our grandparents are out, they'll be back late today. Come in. Sorry to bug. We don't have any recent photos of her. We only have the old one. The only photo we could find. She committed suicide. I know. Yuri told me. By the time I got to the hospital my mom has already passed away. We decided to not tell others that she committed suicide. We told others she died by illness. Because she hadn't been well, people believe it. That's why we didn't mention the true incident. The adults thought it would give a bad impression if we told others it was a suicide. It's ... as if she'd done something bad. I hate it. My mom ... She didn't do anything bad. I'm sorry. I'm piling this on you. How can I say that to someone I've met for the first time? No. It's okay. I'm so sorry. Do you mind if I get a minute alone with her? Okay. Thanks. Soyoka. Hey! Do you have a minute? What is it? I'm supposed to write a graduate student representative's speech draft. But I don't know what to write. Help me write it, okay? We'll figure it out together. It's actually pretty well written. But, I'm not satisfied with it yet. Why did you ask for my help? Because you're such a good writer. No, I'm not. You're really good at writing. No one has ever told me that before. Didn't you write those love letters yourself? Of course I did, I wrote it myself. Like this? How's it? It doesn't make much difference, though. But it's really nice. Is it? Which part? I can't explain it ... but it all sounds nice. Superb. You'd make a great novelist, I'm sure. (To Ayumi) I wrote this book. What's it called? Misaki. It's Auntie Misaki's name. I've read it. The writer is Otosaka Kyoshiro. When I got the letter, I knew it right away. I thought that'd be the writer of this book. Would you ... Would you mind if I asked you to autograph it for me? Is my mom the main character in this book? Yes. You know ... I ... I read that book after I had read all of these. Do you remember these? It features the same content as this book. It's not just a coincidence, is it? You had read them all, too? Are these your high school love letters? Those all were my mother's prized possession. Back in those days ... every chapter was like writing a letter to her. Every time I finished one chapter I would send it to her. Because it's a novel I wrote for her. So, I wanted ... her to be the first one to read it. Did Misaki ... Did she ... Did she read them? She did. She had read them all the times. Many times. So had I. I had read them a few times, too. I could feel ... all the love you had for my mom. Even though ... there were ... many hard times. The man who wrote a novel about a girl modeled after my mom. I had always thought that he would ... he would someday ... come and take my mom away. I had always thought so. I felt ... we had worked very hard to overcome that. Although I wish you could have come sooner. I'm sure my mom would be happy, too. What's wrong? I ... I have a crush on someone. The moment I realized I liked that person ... was in June. He sits next to me. When summer break came ... my feelings for him just kept growing. And after summer break ... I'm scared if I met him again in class my face would be bright red. What is this? Is that why you don't want to go back to school? That is. Why are you laughing? I knew I shouldn't have told you. No, it's okay. You get it wrong. That's why ... That's why ... I've decided I'll go back to school. I'm going back home tomorrow. When I was listening to your story earlier, I felt so ashamed. I'm just nothing with a small hitch. So, I'd do my best and be brave enough to go to school. I see. So, what's that book about? The novel, “Misaki.” I put it over there on the bookshelf, read it yourself. The story begins at university. My schoolmate became my collagemate ... Stop! I'm going to read it now. No spoilers. I was being pushed by the warmth of the early spring breeze. I could feel an incredible excitement in my heart. The wind was bellowing behind me “Go ahead!” “Make your dream come true” You have to go back. I will be all alone. I'm back. What's happening? I'm back. You should have contacted us first. How's Ayumi? Ayumi ... She is doing fine. She is fine. Dad ... I'm back. Welcome back. Sorry, it's not open yet. I'm going back to Tokyo. Ah, you're going back. Thanks for everything. You don't need to. I did nothing. Well, I brought you something. You shouldn't have. Here is it. Did you visit our high school? I did. Thank you so much. These photos ... They were the local kids. I ran into them at school. This is my daughter. And this is my sister's daughter. Soyoka and Ayumi. I came to your parents' house. Thanks to them I was able to offer Misaki incense. I see, you met them. That's great. I talked with them a lot. What did you guys talk about? All kinds of things. I'm glad I came. (Ryunosuke Yoshikawa's Complete Collection) I feel like ... I have the power to write again. It's going to be tough but I hope you'll keep up the good work. Keep pursuing your faith. You are ... my hero. I will. Oh my! This is the first time we shake hands! Goodbye. Take care of yourself! Same to you. Hold up a second! Hold up! Can you autograph this book for me? (To Ayumi) Statements by a graduate student representative. Now I would like to call The Graduate Student Representative, Tono Misaki. Yes! (The 64th Nakatagai High School Graduation Ceremony) Today we celebrate our graduation day. High school was a very special time that will probably be lifelong memories for all of us. It will be priceless memories. When you ask what my future dream and goal are I haven't come up with anything myself yet. Even so, that's fine. Because our future has limitless possibilities. We have countless options in our lives. Each and every one of our graduates here Each and every one of our graduates here present and the future will live their own unique lives. Some of us will live their dreams and might not for others. When you have a bad day when life gets hard We will surely remember this place. How was it? It was great. You think so? The place where we had limitless dreams and possibilities. The place where we were equals, prestigious, and shone with great dignity. Graduate Student Representative. Tono Misaki. Hey! Why you keep your head down Seems your heart isn't here Where is it? Come to your senses I crumpled up the message I wrote and threw it away I dropped pebbles into the water The sound of turbulence The ripples spread out on the surface Through the shimmering sunlight It's where the frogs live And so it goes on Hey, maybe someday I'll look up at the sky with smiles on my face I've been here since a long time ago Singing a love song all the time Singing here Since a long time ago It's always the same love song Stay here, stay with me With a hoarse throat I still praying and singing the frog song Farewell flowers on the gravestone We're just going to have to move on The sun and the moon wobbling on the water The path of brackish water that oozes with blood The distant future that lies between those lights I'll be waiting for you I'll be waiting for you
