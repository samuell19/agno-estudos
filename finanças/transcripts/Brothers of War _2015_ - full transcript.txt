Provided that if either of them shall predecease me, leaving a child..." None of that last bit is relevant. You're both alive, and there are no grandchildren... yet. So it couldn't be more straightforward. Everything is split right down the middle. Oh, and, uh... there was... this. - What is it? - I have no idea. - It's addressed to both of you. - Thank you. FRIEDRICH: "My darling boys. By the time you are reading this, I will be gone, but I wanted you to know that you have both given me so much joy in my life. Not just watching you grow as individuals, but in the knowledge that you both have so much affection for each other. I think brotherly love is a truly wonderful thing. Do you remember when you were both little how we would sit together in front of the fire on rainy evenings, and I would tell you stories? And when I had finished, you used to say, "Papa, just one more." Well, I have one final story for you both. So why don't you pour yourself some beer, hmm? I think you are going to need it. It all began in 1939, on a little dairy farm in England. The farm was owned by Jacob Jackson and his wife Margaret. They had two sons, Jake and Greg." - [grunting] - [mumbling] [laughing] Throw you that. Here. [motor revving] [giggling] Jake, get down! I've told you before! Jake, I said get down! Just you wait till your father hears about this. [hard spanking] That's enough, Jacob. [gasps] Not so rough, Jake! You should learn to treat a lady properly. I'll have that, thank you. Come on. I ain't going up there. Come on. I suppose I'll just have to come down and get you then. YOUNG GREG: You could've killed yourself doing that. But I didn't, did I? Why didn't you have a go? You don't wanna do it because you haven't got the balls. That's why, eh? Have ya? You ain't got the balls to do it. So where did the bike come from, eh? I borrowed it off a mate. 500. Vertical twin. Very sweet. JAKE: Triumph Tiger. MARGARET: And what mate might that be, eh? He says he borrowed it, Jacob. - [grunts] - Just for the day. It's Charlie Palmer's. I'm giving it back tomorrow. You're working here tomorrow, that's what you're doing. There's more than enough work to be done without you messing about with motorbikes that don't belong to you. We're fixing the Fordson tomorrow. Magneto's not sparking. Nothing the two of us can't put right now, eh, Dad? [engine revving] [gun cocks] [whispering] Get rid of it, Jake. We can eat it. Get rid of it. I know how to skin it. Dad showed me. We'll see what your father has to say, shall we? JACOB: Just a kitten. He took your gun. JACOB: Not enough meat on it to feed a sparrow, let alone a family of four. Sorry, old boy. Dogs will like it. What do you want? Well, go on, have a look. Stop it, Jake! Well, he's not interested in your tits, Sally. He's a homo. You're not a homo, are you, Greg? Made you jump. You shouldn't take notice of Jake. He's daft. I don't take any notice of him. I don't believe what he said about you. I know you like girls. I've seen you looking at me. They say there's gonna be a war. What will you do if there's a war? - There might not be. - Of course there will! Everyone says it's gonna happen. What will you do? Are you gonna fight? They might call. That's what they do, ain't it? Come and get you, make you sign up and all. SALLY: If you go to war, you have to kill people. I don't think I could ever kill anyone. Could you? Oh, there might not be a war. What were you reading just now? Nothing. Weren't nothing. I saw you reading. I like reading. [laughing] Oh! [click] "Shakespeare's Sonnets." They're poems. I know what a sonnet is. Shakespeare. - He's good, he is. - He wrote plays as well. Greg, I ain't stupid. Sorry. We used to have to learn poems in school. I liked poetry. I was good at it. Not like sums and stuff. Could never add up to save my life. But... poetry... makes everything... matter. We used to have to learn poems. Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art. Not in lone splendor hung aloft the night. And watching, with eternal lids apart. Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite. John Keats. SALLY: "In a sweet unrest, still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, and so live ever or else swoon to death." I love all that. "Tender-taken breath." The words are so pretty. What's that? What's it look like? Where did you get it? Borrowed it off a mate. No, you didn't. Colt Peacemaker. SALLY: Don't point that thing at me. Ain't loaded. I don't care if it's loaded or not. Don't point it at me. What are you doing with my girl? I'm not your girl. You don't own me. Oh, yes, I do. What's yours is mine. Go to hell, Jake. One in six. One in six. What you reckon, eh? You're mad, you are. Yeah, maybe. GREG: You haven't got the balls to do it, have you? [click] See? Wouldn't have killed me. I reckon the odds are still the same. They don't change, do they? For however many times you do it. Always gonna be one in six. Do you think there will be a war, Mrs. Jackson? - The boys might have to fight. - No one's leaving the farm. Will you miss him if he had to go to war? Right? No one's going anywhere! - [gunshot] - [gasps] TEACHER: "And Cain talked with Abel, his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain, 'Where is Abel, thy brother?' And he said, 'I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?' And he said, 'What hast thou...'" I'll have that, thank you. In your pocket. What's in your pocket, Gregory? Nothing. Stand up. Empty your pockets. - Please... - Now. To the front. - Please... - Now. [spanking with rod] - Another one for you, Frank? - Not for me. Got work to do. Work? This time of night? You staying on for a few more then, are ya? You know me. Friday night. I'll be here for a while. Yeah. I'll be seeing you then. I'll have another one. - Who else is having one? - [all speaking up] I shouldn't have asked, should I? One drink all around. Come home safe, son. For God's sake, Greg, you're a farmer. I'll be fine, Mother. What do you know about fine? There are plenty of young men who can go off and fight. I'm sorry. I can't stay here. Not now. I have to go. If you let him go... [scrubbing] He's not a child no more. He can make up his own mind. No, he can't! - If you let my son go to war... - Our son! Greg's mine. You had nothing to do with him. Jake's yours. [distant shouting] Don't fall behind! Like the bloody lambs... If you lot are the best our country can muster in its hour of crisis, God help the regiment, and God help the country! And what have we got here? An honorable little nancy-boy? Let me make one thing abundantly clear. The only thing you'll be sticking up another man's asshole is the bayonet attached to your Lee Enfield rifle! And the only recipient of such dubious pleasure will be Jerry. - And he's not Jerry, are you? - No, sir. And he's not Jerry either, are you? No, sir! No, sir, no, sir! - Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. - Loud and clear? - Yes, sir! Then stand up straight like a soldier, not a fucking nancy-boy I'm not a nancy-boy, sir. Are you contradicting me, laddy? No, sir. What are you then? A nancy-boy, sir. Louder! A nancy-boy, sir! I wanna hear what you are! Louder! A nancy-boy, sir! Not in my fucking army, you're not. If I so much as see you looking in the direction of another man's asshole, I'll personally ensure you wish you hadn't been born. - Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir! You lot, stop bloody smirking and move your asses or Mr. Nancy-boy here will be poking something up there! SERGEANT-MAJOR: Next two, en guard! SOLDIERS: En guard! SERGEANT-MAJOR: Charge! Next two, en guard! - En guard! - Charge! [shouting] Next two, en guard! En guard! - Charge! - [shouting] Next two, en guard. - En guard! - Charge! [shouting] - [bombs exploding] - [guns firing] Hey! [gunfire] [speaking German] GERMAN SOLDIER: We will take prisoners. [speaking German] [speaking German] Fire! [gunfire continues] Does my breath smell? No more than the rest of you. You're soft in the bleedin' head, you are. Come on. Get your stuff together. We need to make a move. - Flax? - That's what the War Ags say. This is a dairy farm, Frank. I ain't never grown no flax before. They use the seeds for linseed oil. Good for waterproofing and treating timber. It's all part of the war effort, as they say. What about you then? You gonna be growing this stuff and all? Don't you worry about me. I'm already doing my bit for king and country. What if I says no, eh? What if I says they can stick their flax? What are these War Ags gonna do then, eh? They got powers, they have. Oh, yeah? And how come you know so much about it? How come you know so much about these War Ags? You're one of 'em, aren't you, Frank? Not content with running your own farm, you have to go sticking your nose into other people's affairs. Like I said, Jacob, I'm just doing my bit for England. Look, I don't wanna make things difficult between us. I've always been very fond of you and Margaret. I'm just in the middle of a great big chain, that's all. They gives me my orders, and I just pass them on. I know. It's just this bloody war. What with Jake as he is now and Greg gone... Yeah, Margaret is beside herself. I spoke with Greg. I told him he didn't have to go. His mind was made up. You told him that, did you? Well, I knew just how much it would break Maggie's heart to have him gone. Did you now? It was him, wasn't it? Frank. It was him. It was a long time ago, Jacob. Oh, I can do the adding up, Maggie. I can work out exactly how long ago it was. Let's go, eh? Come on then. Monsieur, no. I am your friend. I bring you le petit déjeuner. Voilà. For you, English soldier. Eat. I am a miller. I make the flour. All my own work. Well, not quite. My daughter, she bakes the bread. Christabelle. This is not a good place for you. Germans are everywhere, like rats. Vermin. GREG: It's good. Thank you. She's very, uh, timid. Thanks, sweetheart. I thought the French had all surrendered. We're still bleeding from the last war, and the wounds are deep. But we do what we can. Some of us anyway. We do our bit. But you must go when you've finished. If you head due north, you'll get to the coast. It's only about 20 kilometers from here. And then, when we get there? You have more chance of survival than you've got here. And you? I can take care of us. [footsteps] [speaking German] [guns cocking] Mmm. Very good. [speaking German] Oui! [panting] No! Bastard! No! [panting] Bastard! [Christabelle cries] Ehhh! [gunshots] [gun clicks] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [light chatter] Two pints of the usual, Janet, love. Please. Just having a pint with my son, Frank, if that's all right with you. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. Not if you got work to be doing. Like fucking my wife. Easy does it. I know. You must have a pint, innit? [groaning] Where do you live? The mill? Where is the mill? En... Moulin. Is it just you and... Moulin. [gun clicks] JAKE: See? Wouldn't have killed me. I reckon the odds are still the same. They don't change, do they? You're right. You're right. I haven't got the balls. But you have. You have. You're mad. Why would I wanna kill myself? No. I don't mean aim at you. I want you to aim at me. Why? Bit of fun. Come on, Greg. Come on, Greg. Do it for me. Do it for me, Greg. Do it. One in six. One in six. Come on, Greg. Do it for me. Do it for me, Greg. [sobs] [speaking French] My uniform? Of course. [speaking French] Yes, thank you. [sobbing] Why did you have to do it? Why did you have to go and do this to yourself, son? Flax. They want us to grow flax. What the fuck do they know? Fucking War Ags. What do they know about farming? We don't need them, do we, son? We can run this fucking farm on our own, eh? Just the two of us. You and me, right? [sobbing] [cocks gun] What do you reckon, son? Time to call it a day? [cocks] I'm so sorry, son. - [gunshot] - [glass shatters] I'm sorry. [sobs] It might sting. [groaning] [sobs] JAKE: It's easy. Come on, Greg. Do it. Do it for me, Greg. [click] How long have you been here at the mill? Just over a week. Nine days, to be exact. [speaking French] Burn your uniform, Gregory. They're bringing the new Fordson tomorrow. Apparently this new model is a sight easier to start than the old one. Never did like those chilly mornings. Neither do I, for that matter. Flax is doing nicely up in the top field. I thought you might like to know. You will tell me if you need anything, won't you, Maggie? Right then, uh, I best be off. Well, then, see you tomorrow morning. All being well. Thank you. Uh, merci. Le pain? Le pain. Et merci pour le pomme. La pomme. Le pain, masculin. La pomme, féminin. And what's this? Non. Vous êtes censé dire. Qu'est-ce? Le qu'est-ce... La qu'est-ce. C'est une bûche. Une bûche. - Qu'est-ce? - Un feu. - Un feu. - Oui. - Qu'est-ce? - Les flammes. Les flammes. Qu'est-ce? Votre coeur.

Mes levres. ♪♪ [swing] [giggling] [indistinct chatter] [laughing] [women laughing, chatting] - Here, you must be thirsty. - There you are. You should've seen him. [chatter continues] [laughter] SALLY: Oh, not so rough, Jake. Come on, chop-chop, ladies. We've got lots of moving to do. Here. Are you thirsty? More? It ain't fair. All us girls. And nothing you can do about it. Sorry, Jake. I'd better get back to work. Come on. A bit of fresh air. GREG: Christabelle. [speaking French] [wolf whistle] [screams] Here, let me help. Looks like you twisted your handlebars. What about me? Ain't nothing wrong with your handlebars, sweetheart. Here. Hey, look, your leg's bleeding. [gasps] Get your hands off me! I'm medically trained, ma'am. I don't care if you're a bloody surgeon. You're not touching me. Okay, I'm sorry. It's my fault you fell off your bike. I'll get your bike fixed up free of charge and... Look, and I promise I'll never, ever whistle again. Ever. Ever, ever. Cross my heart. Shut up. Nice buns. It's true what they say about you Americans, ain't it? What do they say about us Americans? Overpaid, oversexed and over here. That's harsh. We're not overpaid. I'm Sam. Sam Williams. You know, I fly T-Bolts with the outfit out of Steeple Morden. You ever been in a Thunderbolt? I could take you for a spin if you like. Or maybe you'd like to come to the dance with me on Saturday at the town hall in Litlington. We could go for a spin on the dance floor, if you prefer. Can you jitterbug? I could show you all the moves. Or maybe you got a few moves of your own you could show me. Greg? - [door closes] - Greg! [footsteps continue] [speaking French] [yelps] [speaking German] [screaming] [speaking German] Non! S'il vous plait! [screaming in French] [whimpers] [laughing] [screaming] [screaming continues] - [screaming] - [gunshots] S'échapper! [bullets whizzing past] CHRISTABELLE: S'échapper! [screaming] She's not here. You know she's not. Is this what you wanted? You have to be more careful, Greg. It's got all the names, all the codes. It's all in here. Is there anything else inside? No. Are you sure? I wouldn't go in there. There are explosives everywhere. I laid them earlier. Come, this way. [dogs barking] It's their dogs. We need to move quickly. Wake up, Greg. We need to make more progress tonight before it gets light. Where are you taking me? Just outside Beauvais. It's about 50 kilometers from here. Beauvais? There's a plane dropping off a British agent. There will be space for you on the way back. You're going home. This is my home now. No. You can't stay in France. It's not safe here. You know too much. It's not safe for any of us if you remain here. You have to leave. But Christabelle... Christabelle is strong. Believe me. She is made out of the same stuff as her father. She will be fine. She needs me. Listen, my friend. It's too late. It will be over by now. There's nothing you can do. It's war, Greg. And war is not kind.

You never wrote... or anything. Not a word. How could you do that to me? My own son! [sobs] I thought you were dead. Do it for me. One in six. One in six. Come on. Do it for me. Do it for me, Greg. [click] I've done it! I've done it. We've done it, Greg! Greg, we've done it. Greg! [click] - No, Greg! - [click] What are you... What are you doing? I'm so sorry, Jake. You didn't deserve any of this. [gunshot] FRIEDRICH: "You are probably both wondering why I have chosen to tell you this story and why I have spared you none of the unpleasant details. About 20 years ago, I made a shocking discovery. I was adopted as a young child. I came across the adoption papers purely by chance, when both my parents were still alive. But they had brought me up with so much love that I could never bring myself to tell them that I had discovered the secret which they had decided to keep from me. But of course curiosity is a very powerful thing. I wanted to find out more, and the more I found out, the more I needed to know. I was born in Abbeville in 1943 to a young French girl who had been captured by officers from the Sicherheitsdienst. Yes, of course you realize now, don't you? Her name was Christabelle. She died in labor in a basement of the town hall which was being used to interrogate members of the French Resistance. But I... I had survived. And by a stroke of good fortune, I had blue eyes and blond hair, a typical Aryan, so I was taken as part of the Nazi Lebensborn Program. Six months later, I was adopted by Wilhelm and Helga Gutenberg, your grandparents. Soon after Mama and Papa died, I decided to travel to England to find my birth father. By then I already knew his name was Gregory Jackson. My journey took me all the way to Manor Farm. He was still there farming the land, although he was frail and weak. Like Mama and Papa, he had carried the burden of his secret throughout his life. He told me everything. His court-martial for desertion and the dark days he spent in prison for his brother's death. It all just poured out of him. He even took me into the barn to show me where he had ended Jake's life. I promised that I would go back and see him again, but as you know, my recent illness has been debilitating. I never made it back to England, so in a way, the story is incomplete. Gregory Jackson, your grandfather, grew old in the belief that brotherly love was just a fanciful notion which could never be a reality. There is a chance, a probability even, that he is now dead. But he may still be alive. Go and see him, will you? Go and show him that he has two wonderful grandsons who love each other the way brothers should. And tell him that you both made me, his son, the proudest man who ever lived. Do it for him and you and for me. Finish the story. Your loving father." ♪♪ [no audible dialogue] ♪♪ [continues] [no audible dialogue] ♪♪ [continues] Subtitles by explosiveskull
