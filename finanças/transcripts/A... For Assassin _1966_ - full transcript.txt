Who is it? It's me, Peter. Angela. Good evening. And Armando? -Our car broke down... He stayed to try and fix it, and I preferred to walk back. Then I'll leave it open. What time is it? 11:30, lady. Goodnight. -Goodnight, Peter. Uncle John. Uncle John. 'A... For Assassin' "I am John Prescott." "And this is my last will and testament." "Is everyone here?" "I think so." "I know that this moment is too important for you." How nice. It's like he's here with us. "Don't pretend to be upset, little sister..." "Because no one's going to believe you." "I am..." "Well, I was... very rich." "That made your hearts jump." "I'm lucky." "Few people amount to anything." "Let's see..." "Who will I leave all this money to?" "There's my son, Julian, the last of the Prescotts..." "Poor chap." "My sister Martha, perhaps? You looked after me like a wife." "But how boring it was to have you always around me, like crow." "With that horrible medallion you play with all the time!" "Who, then?" "To you, dear nephew George, and your faithful wife?" "To tell you the truth, you've always been an odious and insignificant man." "And your jealousy, so impotent, so cowardly..." "It infuriated me." "Adriana would be better, yes, from every point of view..." "Especially..." "If you knew... Let's not go there." "She's your wife." Bastard. "You can insult me now. But why didn't you do it earlier?" "Scared?" Forget it, George. He's dead, after all. A dead man who knew us perfectly. "Angela, perhaps? My poor brother Paul's inconsolable orphan." "We certainly got on very well..." "But she would always stare at me..." "That reminded me too much of the farmer who fattens his capon..." "To eat it at Christmas!" "That only leaves the faithful..." "But they're all faithful in this household." "I was saying, that only leaves my faithful Giacomo, my trusted secretary." "The times we spent together! Remember?" "Or that youngster, my distant relative..." "Armando. Very pleasant... Very." "So my niece Angela says." "Or is she perhaps alluding to his virility? Right, dear?" "You want my money. Fine..." "But, as I worked hard for it, I don't like the idea of giving it away." "All of my possessions will be divided into three equal parts..." "And only three. Among everyone I mentioned earlier." "Only three of you will have the right to become rich at my expense." "So I leave everything to those three..." "Relatives, or not. Who, in a month from today..." "Will still be able to collect the inheritance." "But be careful..." "If any more than three of you present yourselves at notary Jackson's office..." "None of you will get anything." "However, if there are less than three of you..." "Those remaining will share the inheritance equally." You'll be there, right darling? -But it's insane! This will can't be valid. -Not bad, the old man. "One last thing, and I've finished..." "For the month in question, I want you to continue living here... "All together, in my house!" Won't that be fun. "And given that I know how much you all love each other..." "It's sure to be a noble and courteous race." "Well, my dears..." "I'm sure most of you will be joining me very soon..." "...in Hell." "Best wishes. Yours, John Prescott." I protest... This will is immoral. It's a provocation to... And it's horrendous. Calm down, dear. We'll get our share, you'll see. Poor Julian. The last of the Prescotts. Prescott. Notary, in my capacity as Mr Prescott's administrator... I ask you on behalf of everyone... -You... You be quiet. Gentlemen... I declare that none of the clauses in this will are against the law in this country. Also because Mr Prescott, as you know... Left a handwritten copy of the words recorded on the cassette. You don't understand. -In light of this... I'll see you in my office in a month from now, at the same time. Which means I will see three of you... Who will want to exercise their right to the inheritance. Ladies. Gentlemen. Notary... Inspector Matt would like a copy of the will for his report. Certainly, Sergeant Robson, I'll have a copy sent to him. My father cleaned your car. -Thank you, Mary. Good morning, Inspector Matt. -Greetings, Doctor. Trading places? -Right, duty calls. I'll accompany you, I could do with some fresh air before I go in. Well, Inspector, do you already know who the culprit is? What do you want me to say? I've been here for a week and I don't know where to start. Their alibis all rely on each other, and they all had a motive to kill him. Money, jealousy, hate. And I can tell you they wouldn't be wrong... He kept them close to him with the illusion of an inheritance. I don't envy you, Inspector... Those Prescotts are proud, they're hard to break. I'm in no hurry... Twenty years on the force has taught me to be patient. But tell me, the millions... Who got them? To everyone, and no one. I knew Prescott could be mean... But this time he really outdid himself. He made quite a curious will. Don't tell me we also have to figure who inherits the millions? Perhaps. Giacomo, there's no obligation for you to continue in your duties as a secretary. With your permission, Angela... I'll stay here to do my duty till the end of the month. Besides, my work goes on... Mr. Prescott's business dealings were quite vast. Mr. Prescott... My brother is a viper... He found a way to get at us from beyond the grave. I don't think any of us want to subject ourselves to this type of persecution. Least of all you. Right, Giacomo? Angela, Mr. Prescott's will has given you a bad impression of me... But I won't allow you to insinuate that I influenced your uncle's decisions. Listen to me... I believe... ...that we can deal with this immoral will in another way. Listen to him! One of us cut the old man's throat... And he protests because the will is immoral. My dear, you have such a way with words! You should have more tact, more manners. My little sister-in-law's chaste ears! Where did you find such modesty? When you were a stripper? You've always been jealous of my artistic career. Heaven forbid! I appreciate the benefits... You've always been a master at taking your clothes off. Enough. Do you have to attack each other all the time? There must be an amicable way to resolve this. Don't you agree? Of course. As good friends. Just look at us... Don't you see the hate and mistrust in all of us? They've always been there. But we must find a way. Listen, whoever killed uncle... Hasn't really given us reason to grieve... So it seems both useless and dangerous to find out who did it. There's only one thing we can do... We'll go about this month as though nothing happened... When it's over we'll present ourselves to the notary for the inheritance... Just three of us. Like it says in the will. Then, instead, we'll divide into seven equal parts... We'll all have enough money to live comfortably for the rest of our lives. I agree, my love, I think it's a great idea. That suits me as well. George's proposal makes sense. Sure it does. Perfect sense... There's one small problem... Which three of us will present themselves to the notary? And who says that once they're legally in possession of uncle's inheritance... ...they'll still want to share it? -We'll draw straws. We must trust each other. Even if we split it we'll be rich. There will be enough for everyone. You're formidable, George. How much will we get? There are also diamonds, isn't that right, Aunt Martha? Aunt Martha! Adriana wants the diamonds! Of course, dear. Women love jewellery. And dividing it, your wife will have two parts. Why don't you marry Armando? Then you'll have two as well. Right. That's a thought. Aunt Martha... Behave... Or we might think you're only pampering Julian to get his share of the cake. My share of the cake. Aunt Martha. You really are callous, just like he was. You'd kill us all, just to get your hands on all that damned money. We're all evil, this is John Prescott's real legacy. Enough of this. Enough! If we don't come to an agreement we'll end up killing each other. You heard his horrible voice. It's no use pretending... Nobody will have nothing, or only one of us will get everything. The smartest! -...or most ruthless. As you wish... We all have our cards in our hands... But nobody will touch them until it suits them. Well? You all think the same as Angela? He wouldn't have made a will like that if a deal was possible. Do what you want. Do what you want. Too bad. However, I'm always open to an amicable solution. Good morning. I see this is a family reunion. We're all anxious to know the killer's name. We're hanging on your every word, Inspector. You overestimate me, Ms... Angela? -Exactly. There's no hurry. You'll see, sooner or later... It's always the case. If you're so impatient to know, the killer's name, I mean... Why don't you tell me? Because you know, don't you? You think so? No one wants to deprive you of the pleasure of finding out for yourself. Thank you, but I was only asking for your benefit. I heard about the will, and I thought that a culprit in prison... Is... How can I put it? One less rival. No? One more, one less... You're forgetting that only three of us can present ourselves to the notary... And there are seven of us. -Yes, that's also true. It means I'll have to figure it out alone. Very well. It trouble me but... (cut) (cut) Prescott, his niece. And his throat had been cut. Probably by a robust, bladed, weapon that has yet to be found. The safe was open, but nothing had been removed. It's an important detail... Because the safe is fitted with a timed mechanism... That only opens between 22:00 and 22.15. Knowing the combination isn't enough... You need to activate the mechanism within those fifteen minutes. That's enough, Robson. Prescott's watch confirms the time of the murder - 22:00. It stopped when it fell, and remained stuck at that time. An expensive and highly precise watch. I didn't know you were so knowledgeable about watches. This is also important... From what you told me, Prescott synchronised it to the safe... Your uncle was meticulous. -Great, Inspector, you know everything... Almost. -Almost? I still don't know what happened to the knife, that you saw? That I think I saw, but you know, in that moment... It was almost midnight when you killed him... Forgive me... When you found your uncle. -It was 23:35... And he was already dead. I have a cast iron alibi. As you know very well, I was at the theatre with my husband. I left the villa at 20:00 and I returned at 23:30. The caretaker will confirm it. -And who else? The theatre usher who showed me to my seat. So, between 21:00 and 22:15, you were at the theatre. Precisely. -I assume it's the same for Armando. That's right, only our car broke down at around 11:00... I returned home on foot, and he came back later. You can go. But make yourself available. -Are you joking, Inspector? You know that none of us can leave for the entire month. I was forgetting. Because of the will. Show Adriana Prescott in. I'm warning you, Adriana, don't corrupt the Inspector as well. No? And why not? You asked for me. -Please excuse me... But you'll have to answer some questions. Is that all? I'll tell you everything you want to know, Inspector... Everything! Just questions. Tell me... Where were you on the night of the murder, after nine o'clock? I was naked, Inspector. Didn't I tell you? I was getting ready to go to bed... It always takes a long time. I'm used to pampering myself. And then, George came in. You know, my husband's crazy about me. Especially when he sees me like that... It's true, Inspector, I can't hold him back! He's a wild one, George. Then we turned off the light and, at 11:30, Angela's screaming woke us up. He told me he didn't need me any more. So I went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea. Mary's off duty at that time... So I had to make it myself. I went to the lounge to wish Martha goodnight... And then I went to bed. It was 22:15 when Giacomo came into the room... I'm certain of the time because I asked him. As soon as Giacomo left, I also went to my room... After I had accompanied Julian to his room. I was the only one who didn't hear Angela scream... Because I got in late. You know, the car. No one stopped to help you? -No. There was nobody around. -Right. So you left the car by the road. -No, I managed to start the engine... But it took a while. It was an electrical fault. Learn, Robson... You never know what to do when we break down. Seems you're very good with cars. With engines. I've been driving since I was 15. I love racing cars. So, you raced to the villa and arrived before your wife... You caught up with Prescott, and... Inspector! I'm only joking. -You frightened me. I've always told you the truth. I like you, kid. You can go. Is that everyone? -Peter and his daughter Mary. Who? -The caretaker. They don't have anything to say. -Then we've finished. Inspector, the fact remains that even tonight the killer sleeps peacefully. Robson, nobody sleeps peacefully after they've killed a man. You're right, Inspector. Nervous, my love? -Because of what happened that night. I don't know if I can keep this secret. -Try not to get involved, dear. Sooner or later it will come out. He'll talk. Just think how terrible it would be if suspicion fell on you, my love. The press would have a field day... I can see the headlines now: 'Thrown in the mud' Don't exaggerate, darling. Besides, it's the last thing I'd want. You know I love you. -"I love you, I love you" But I had to give up my career for you. And look at the state of me now! Forgive me. It will all be over soon. Let's hope so. Then we can finally enjoy this famous inheritance. Adriana, stay close to me. I need you. Look at that! Isn't that Armando? -Armando? What's he up to at this hour? -I don't know. My love, I thought you weren't coming. Why did you want to meet here? Wouldn't my room have been better? Look at what I found. -What? I think it's the murder weapon. -Yes, it could be. And that's blood. -No doubt about it. Who could've put it here? -You might want to ask Julian. Julian? Yes, it might well have been him! That idiot? No... In all the confusion, he probably took it from the study. He takes anything within arms reach. -Shall we tell the Inspector? Let him work it out. -Listen, Angela... I've had enough of this. Let's leave. What? Have you gone mad? And give up everything? I don't care about the money. -Money? We're talking about a million pounds. You're all that matters to me. -My love, I love you too... But that money will make us rich. Don't you see? Be patient, just a few more days. Then we'll always be together. I must go now. Goodbye, my love. Inspector. You frightened me. I wouldn't walk alone around here, if I were you. Why? If I'd wanted to, I could've killed you quite easily. They might find your body a few days later, full of worms. Do you really feel so safe? With that will mixed up in all of this... Aren't there only meant to be three of you to share the inheritance? Sure, but that doesn't mean we're in any danger. But you are. If not now, in the next few days. As long as John Prescott's killer can move around undisturbed. Unless... -Unless? You tell me what you didn't say when you were questioned. Inspector, I told you everything I know on the night of the murder. I get it. You don't want to cooperate. Just remember, if anything happens to you, I warned you. You see, Inspector... No, leave it, you obviously don't trust me. And to think, I could have you arrested immediately for false testimony. And perhaps... Yes, perhaps also for murder. I'll tell you everything. The night of the murder, Adriana, I mean my wife... I went to get her a glass of water in the kitchen, just after ten... And... -And? There was no one there... Giacomo was lying when he said he was making a cup of tea. With the glass of water, I was passing through the corridor when... I saw Giacomo running towards me from the opposite end of the corridor. I almost dropped the glass. I wanted to tell you but Adriana was afraid of the repercussions... She didn't want to accuse anyone. Adriana's your wife, if I'm not mistaken? Then she was also alone after ten. -Only a few minutes. But more than enough to enter the study and cut the old man's throat. Don't talk nonsense, Inspector. Nonsense is the pillar of any investigation. What room was Giacomo coming from? -I don't know... He suddenly appeared at the other end of the corridor... I was returning to my room. My husband didn't leave the room that night, my dear Inspector. Didn't I tell you? -No, dear, you can tell him. I told the Inspector the truth. George, I'm sorry dear, but didn't we agree...? Yes, dear, but we cannot keep it a secret. We'll have less to be afraid of. Listen to your husband. Well, let's hear it. Everything, darling? It must have been almost ten... -It was after ten, Adriana! A few minutes past. -Yes, it's true. I even asked him the time, and he said "ten". Interesting. And then? And then... Then I asked him to make a cup of tea. -Wasn't it water? Of course it was water! And it was after ten. Yes, yes... Sure. -Don't get excited, madam. So, your husband left the room just before ten... To make a cup of tea. And he returned a few minutes after ten with a glass of water. Perhaps stopping off to see uncle John so he could... Make a nice circular cut around his soft neck. It's not true. It's not true, I swear! I didn't love my uncle... He forced me to live here so he could court my wife. Yes, I hated him. But not to the point of... You must believe me. Believe him. My husband's the jealous type, but he's harmless. Okay, I believe you. I believe everyone until I have proof. The secretary, where is he? George was running down the corridor. What are you talking about? I was coming from the kitchen. Please, George. Continue. As I was saying, it was around ten fifteen... I'd just finished my tea and I was going to bed... When Sir George almost knocked me over in the corridor. I had to hold on to him, so I wouldn't fall. One of his buttons fell off, and he wasn't carrying a glass of water. I'm sorry... I didn't want to say anything but you forced me to. The button as well! You thought of everything. But you won't succeed in laying the blame on me, murderer! It's all lies, Inspector. He killed my uncle. Relax, George, you'll only make it worse if you get angry... Think of your liver. -Yes, calm him down. So, you claim that George was wearing his dressing gown. No, Inspector, I said he was in his pyjamas. Right... In his pyjamas. Mind if I see them? -Not at all. You'll see for yourself that he's lying. He's falling marvellously for it! You were great. Darling, stay in your place. Don't be imprudent! Your husband is as dumb as a chicken. He loves you too much. And that other one, he wouldn't understand a thing even if we told him. I don't like the Inspector... He looks too stupid to be a real one. The dressing gown will be the decisive blow. It was a formidable idea of yours, worthy of the late Prescott. I couldn't put up with that incompetent fool George any longer. And his perverted uncle! Yes, but sleeping with the old man made you smart. But not rich. Yet. We will be very soon. It's the reward I deserve, after so many years of being bullied and abused. He made me slave for every crumb I earned. Yes, Mr. Prescott. Certainly, Mr. Prescott. Okay, Mr. Prescott. Yes, Sir. Mr. Prescott. How I hated you. He had no respect for my dignity. Men were only mannequins subservient to his wealth to him. Toys to flirt with. And when he didn't you any more... Fired! Without mercy. You got what you deserved, John Prescott. Is this the jacket? -Yes, that's the one. There are no buttons missing. -As I said, Inspector... It was him who came running from uncle's study... But I assure you... -Not one button missing. But one of them is attached with a different thread. And the cloth around it has been repaired. I broke it two days ago. I was ironing it. You don't look like much of a housewife to me, lady Prescott. But it wasn't him. He didn't kill him. Isn't that right, my love? -You did your best. Inspector. Come, it's important. Murderer. You want to ruin me. Did he hurt you? Come to your senses! Enough of this farce. Act like a man! -I'll kill you. Murderer! Stop it, George. I didn't want this... (cut) Here, Inspector. I just found it and I thought I should tell you. Have you touched it? -No, Inspector. "Who, then?" "To you, dear nephew George, and your faithful wife?" "To tell you the truth, you've always been an odious and insignificant man." "And your jealousy, so impotent, so cowardly..." "It infuriated me." "Adriana would be better, yes, from every point of view..." "Especially..." Damn you. And you! Leave him alone, poor thing. He's not the one you should be taking your anger out on. The truth hurts, auntie. -Stop it. You've all got in for me. But you'll all get what you deserve. Giacomo will kill all of you. You all saw how he killed uncle. You really think it was Giacomo? He's been with uncle for years, since Africa. They made a good couple. But it must have been him! Because... I'm not guilty. We're all guilty. Dear George, even if you didn't kill him... You're glad someone did it for you. You hated my brother! Giacomo saw you that night... So you spoke up first to eliminate him... But he was smarter than you. -But I didn't kill him. Uncle was generous to me, he gave me all the money I wanted. To be honest, he gave it to Adriana. What are you getting at? You're a hyena. A Prescott, my dear. Just a Prescott. Who enjoys making others suffer! Right? But deep down, you're the unhappiest of us all. You don't know how to love anyone. -Dearest auntie, you're unhappy... Reduced to clinging onto all that remains of your husband... A medallion! He has found his peace... Love is something you'll never understand. Me!... I'm the last of the Prescotts! -Come, Julian. The last of the Prescotts. And now you're in it up to your neck, right, little brother? Go on. Spit out your poison. Idiot... You still haven't realised that your wife is the snake... She's pretending to save you to get rid of you... By making the Inspector think she's on your side. She's in league with Giacomo. Haven't you figured it out? Stop it! -It's the truth. She married you to get her hands on uncle's money. She hasn't thought of anything else since she set foot in this house. She tried with him too, you know. To repay you for taking her out of those whorehouses. Stop it. I don't want listen to you anymore. Yes, cover your ears... Listen to her when she tells you that she loves you. She sent you to the kitchen after ten, then she said you left earlier. She pulled that button off your jacket. Who cares? You love her. And now she's in her lover's arms. Giacomo... And they're both plotting to send you to prison. I heard them. It's not true. Say it's not true. Say it's not true. I'll kill him! -Do it, if you have the courage... But that won't change things! She's with him now, why don't you go and enjoy the show! Go... Go and see. Go! What's got into you? Have you gone crazy? No, please, George might come. You're tickling me. Stupid! Then you really are serious. And George didn't believe you were a bad man. Giacomo, a bad man! I killed her. "To you, dear nephew George, and your faithful wife?" "To tell you the truth, you've always been an odious and insignificant man." "And your jealousy, so impotent, so cowardly..." Stop it! I don't want to listen to you anymore. Yes, cover your ears... Listen to her when she tells you that she loves you. She sent you to the kitchen after ten, then she said you left earlier. She pulled that button off your jacket. Who cares? You love her. And now she's in her lover's arms. Giacomo... And they're both plotting to send you to prison. I heard them. It's not true. Say it's not true. Say it's not true. The first victims. So, Giacomo, you and poor Mrs. Adriana... I can't deny it, but you understand... I'm a gentleman. That's why I lied. It all happened exactly how poor George described it. I was coming from George's room... Adriana had called me. And you met George in the corridor. Who left his room with the excuse that he was getting water. Precisely. And I was afraid George might have thought I killed Prescott. Of course. So you made up the story of the button on the jacket with Adriana's help. But only as a possible defence in case George accused me. What did Adriana have to tell you that was so urgent? She wanted to tell me, there was a very good chance... ...someone would kill Mr. Prescott that very night. Then Adriana knew. And naturally you didn't believe her. No, Inspector. Did you get that, Robson? -Certainly, Inspector... Evidently, Giacomo was going to tell us the name of the culprit. Right. A culprit who isn't here anymore. Therefore, gentlemen, we can consider this case closed. Gentlemen, this is the murder weapon. An African weapon. Weren't you also in South Africa with Mr. Prescott? I had the fortune of meeting him down there, Inspector. Very fortunate, with all the money you're going to get. The fact that I am also one of the heirs... Is all down to Mr. Prescott's peculiarities. Evidently, Giacomo. Evidently. Have you ever seen this knife before? I'm not sure, Inspector. And you, Martha... Were you in Africa before or after your brother made his fortune? Before... It was afterwards that he found a diamond mine. Lucky him! I beg your pardon. I mean a diamond mine! And this knife... Does it remind you of anything? They were often used by explorers in Africa... They carved their initials on them. We were saying that none of you have seen this knife before. Strange. Because the killer... ...left their fingerprints on it. Forensics did a fine job. A real fine job. Whose fingerprints are they? -The late Adriana's. Then it was her. -I wouldn't say so. From what I know, she had a good relationship with the old man... That is, Mr. Prescott. Besides, your fingerprints are on it too. -What? Mine? But... -Now you're exaggerating, Inspector... You know very well that Armando was with me on the night of the murder. Yours as well, Angela. -Naturally, mine are on it... I found the knife, and I showed it to Armando. It's true, Inspector. Would it be indiscreet of me if I asked you where you found it? In the attic, I have a passion for knick-knacks. Is that a crime? As long as you didn't use it to... Angela didn't kill anyone. -Why? Was it you? I couldn't do such a thing! Besides, why would I? My dear Armando, the money. Isn't that reason enough? Besides, didn't you all hate the tyrant? So, this knife? -I gave it to Adriana, happy? Anyway, Armando and I... -...were at the theatre. Your alibi. So, at ten o'clock, you and Armando were at the theatre... Martha was playing patience with Julian... Giacomo was making tea. What was I doing at ten o'clock that night? It would all make sense if Prescott had died at ten. But the safe could only be opened between ten and ten fifteen. Exactly, Giacomo? -Exactly. And only by Mr. Prescott. No one else knew the combination. He didn't trust anyone. -And for good reason! And it couldn't be opened in less than two minutes. Now pay attention... The deceased's watch stopped at exactly ten o'clock when it fell. And here's where the killer made a mistake... To procure an alibi... They broke the watch after they killed him, making it look like it had fallen... Then they moved watch hands to a time that suited them; ten o'clock. In their haste, they forgot to allow for those few indispensable minutes... ...the victim would have needed to open the safe. My compliments, Inspector... Your lucid deductions are compelling... It's a pity you still don't know the killer's name. It could also be yours, Angela. Let me tell you... That coroner says he was killed sometime between ten and eleven thirty. And that's the time you found the deceased. You were the first to find him. Therefore, none of you have an alibi. Ugly thing. It's mine, I found it. -Calm down, Julian, Angela found it. Or not? No, it's mine. It's true... I had forgotten. It was Julian who found it. But I don't see the difference. And after he found it in the attic... He found it a second time next to the deceased, right Julian? I'm the last of the Prescotts. And then you hid in the park, for fun, naturally. Because the killer left it at the scene of the crime... Evidently, they felt safe. You're very smart... None of the fingerprints bear the characteristics... ...of someone holding a knife to strike. It's strange... It seems you've done nothing more than pass the knife from one person to another. So much so, that you're fingerprints are also on it. Perhaps, I may have touched it by chance but I don't remember. You don't remember. Yet it's quite a distinct knife... There's an 'A' carved on it. 'A' for Armando. Adriana. Angela. 'A' for assassin! I'm not interested in Prescott's money... I only want to know what your role is in this horrible business. But I haven't done anything. I just set things in motion. Then who killed him? -Aunt Martha, haven't you worked it out? The Inspector's proven himself a genius. -Martha? But why? Because Adriana gave her that knife with an 'A' carved on the handle. So what? You're so stupid! Fifteen years ago, Aunt Martha married Philip Fenning, an Austrian. What you don't know, is that in those times... Uncle John was a poor fellow who went around looking for diamonds. And the Austrian teamed up with him. The Austrian also had a knife with an 'A' inscribed on the handle... One fine day he was found dead with his throat cut... And there was no trace of the knife. -Was it Prescott? No one knew for sure, but aunt Martha suspected him. So much so, that shortly after her husband's murder... (cut) (cut) ...saying he had found a large diamond mine. Aunt Martha spent years looking for that knife. So, when Julian found it in the attic... I passed it on to Adriana who took it straight to Martha... Convinced I didn't know anything. It was the proof aunt Martha had been waiting for. And she had her revenge. So that's why Adriana was able to make up that story against George... She knew Martha was going to kill him that night. Of course, dear. And I knew that she knew. Simple, really. Then the 'A' carved into the handle stands for 'Austrian'? You finally got it. How come you know all this? Auntie must have told us the story a thousand times when we were children. Has the Inspector figured it out? The Inspector is a very intelligent man, but not enough. Angela, let's go away from here. -Of course, my love, tomorrow... You're right, our love is more important than uncle's inheritance. But now you must go. I'll come to your room later. I'll be waiting. What's wrong? Giacomo's gone crazy. -What are you talking about? I saw him coming out of the generator room... He chased after me! He wants the money for himself. He went to his room to get a pistol, he wants to kill us! That's impossible. Calm down. I'll talk to him. Just try to calm down. Calm down. Tell him we don't care about the money, he can have it all. But stop him before he does something foolish. Relax, I'm not going to jeopardise our happiness for anyone. Take it, Giacomo is armed and he could kill you before you get a chance to talk. Go on. You lock yourself in and don't open it for anyone... Don't be afraid. I'll convince him, you'll see. Giacomo. Giacomo, don't do anything foolish! Angela. -Giacomo. What's going on? -You must hurry! Armando wants to kill you, he has a gun! What is this about? It's not time to get rid of him. Yes, but he's not as stupid as he looks... He found out about us, he wants to kill you. Another one of your schemes? That last stunt with Adriana almost cost me my life. But you agreed. -Yes... Because it was essential to our plan. But what are you hiding from me now? -I tell you Armando's looking for you! You're not scared, are you? -You know very well I'm not scared... And that I also want to get my hands on that money. Then there's no time to lose. -Be careful, Angela... I'm not going to let you play me. We're cut from the same cloth. And if you don't tell me the truth, you won't have time to regret it. Watch out, dear. Armando will shoot you. He's not the only one who thought of that. Looking for me, Armando? Police. Inspector Matt, I'm calling from the Prescott villa... Inspector Matt, this is Angela Prescott... Can you come? There's another dead body. And another killer. You're good, Angela. It's your turn now. Damn you! I'll kill you! Angela! What happened? The power went out, then I heard gun shots and... Disappointed? No, don't be afraid, I didn't kill him. It was Armando who killed him, and he killed Armando. Before he died, naturally. Funny, isn't it? It could be a Chinese puzzle, but it's reality instead. It all started when Adriana gave you that knife... You were convinced I didn't know the story about South Africa... Not all of it, at least. Are there no limits to your wickedness? Poor Martha... You killed your brother to avenge your husband's death. But vendetta's also have a price. -And now I guess you'll turn me in. That's where you're mistaken. You always said I was wicked... I could've turned you in a thousand times, if I'd wanted to. It would be nice to think you did it for me... And not because it was more convenient for you to lie. Yes, it's true. It was more convenient. Adriana and George are dead, and Armando and Giacomo killed each other Poor chaps, they were so stupid they didn't even see it coming. All that remains is for you to turn me in... And you'll have succeeded in your goal. You'll be the only one who collects the inheritance. That's right, but I want to be kind to you... If you take that fool, and you leave this house... Promising you won't present yourself to the notary... I'll keep what I know to myself. Agreed? If the Inspector hasn't already reached the same conclusion. Anyway, he doesn't have proof. I'm your salvation. You're even worse than a murderer. There's one thing I want to tell you... You're worthy in everything to take your uncle's place. But why do you hate me? I haven't done anything... You killed uncle John. -Yes, sure... That's right. You didn't do anything! You just stood there, behind-the-scenes... Until they all killed each other. You just limited yourself to helping them disappear. And that seems like a little to you? I'm tired. It's been a tiring day for me. Then we're agreed... You and that idiot won't show yourselves to the notary. Otherwise... I'm going lie down. Call me when the Inspector arrives. Come, Julian. We must get ready. This isn't our home anymore, we have to go. Julian. I carved it. But why...? It came out good. I made one for Angela. Angela? What are you talking about? What did you do for Angela? Answer me. Angela! Knife! I gave the knife to Angela. Angela is evil. You carved the initial on the knife. Angela! I killed my brother because of that initial. I killed him. Angela. Snake! Aunt Martha. Lady Angela. Where is Angela? -Inspector! This way, Inspector. Too late... Inspector. Why did you do it? Why? The other knife was a fake. It was Angela who made it. I killed my brother, thinking I was getting revenge... But all I did was play Angela's game instead. No one knows... That other knife, I carved the 'A' on it. But Angela never knew. You see, daddy? Angela never knew. She never knew! Angela never knew. I am the last of the Prescotts. The last of the Prescotts!
