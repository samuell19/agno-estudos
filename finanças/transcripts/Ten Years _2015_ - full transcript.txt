"Charity rice donation from Leg Co member, Zhang Kun Xiang" "Date: 1st May, 2020 Guests: Miss King Chee, Lam, President of TMD "and Mr Kam Wa, Yeung, President of Fortune Party" Come from the front. So the reporters can have time to take photos. From the front? That's bold. Where should I stand by, then? Boss said it's gotta be bold and headline-worthy. You are supposed to be a volunteer. Just pop up from backstage. Hairy, you're a genius. What a terrible waste... ...that the boss didn't give you this job. If the police didn't kill one of your kind do you think you'd get this job? And paid you well by just waving a gun around? Right! You can blame your mom that you're not Indian. Hang on, I got it! I'll pull out the gun. You can be the first to hold me down. Then those bosses will see your effort, yeah? At least you'll get some credit. Okay, piss off backstage and try again. Sure, here we go! Hold up! Ain't it weird to just walk directly at them? What do you want, then? Boss. How's the Curry? He's cool, still rehearsing with Hairy. Keep an eye on him, don't let him walk around. We're on that, Boss. Commissioner. Okay, no problem. It will be taken care of. It'll cost 800 grand more to the budget, okay? It won't be a good show if no bullet is fired. If people aren't terrified, who'd give a shit about the National Security Law? What's a terrorist attack without bloodshed? Shoot Kam Wa then. It's better to shoot a man. That's right. He just became the Chairman of the committee. The whole thing will be more convincing. Kam Wa is brilliant. But the Fortune Party has been in the spotlight a lot lately. I say we should let King Chee have it instead. Mayor Fei is right. If King Chee is shot... TMD's popularity will skyrocket for sure. This is the balance the Central Government wants to see. Mrs. Chan, to be fair, Fortune Party has only just gained its standing. How can it be compared to the established TMD? Ask Vincent, he knows best. They barely won the district election last year. Of course. The more support we get from the citizens. The easier we operate for the country. I believe the Central Government will be pleased too. I have no opinion. But we have enough manpower for any situation. Everyone! What exactly are we talking about? We're here... ...for the National Security Law! So we need to trigger a mass panic. Am I right? There's a man and a woman in front of me. Tell me... Which one do I shoot to get a bigger impact? Jerk! Bitch! Don't hold it too tight, it could backfire. Alright, alright, you are hurting me. Boss. Hey Peter, the plan's changed. You must fire the gun. That's a different story, Boss. Cut the crap, I've looked out for you. You'll get 500 grand more for that. But I could go to jail, Bill. You don't have to kill him. You can go back to India and hide for a while. Do you know who gave the order? The former Police Commissioner. So don't worry about that. Boss. I take it! Oh, is this your call? Let's join the meeting up there. Shall we? You're a bloody idiot! Peter, take it or not. Think about it! Who am I shooting at, then? They're still arguing. You'll know soon enough. "Celebrating Labour Day" You're welcome. Hello granny. Wish you good health. We are all Khan! We need justice! Senator Yeung... Hey, Michelle. Hi, Edward. How was the ride here? "It is all Police's fault, fully responsible for manslaughter." We shall shoot... The woman! Mass panic is guaranteed if a woman is shot. That's the point. Sure. Shooting a woman is definitely an act of terrorism. We will get a good reason. I've said so before. The bullet should go to King Chee. Mr. Cheung is the most clear-headed of all. We shouldn't put national matters at stake. And be blinded by short-term gain. Good! It's best if we're on the same page. I may say that. Once the National Security Law is implemented. All of you have great credit on it. Are you panicking? No need to push yourself for that. It's just about money. Tell my Boss you wanna quit, and I'll take it over. I'll give you back 100 grand. Why are you so eager? Do you think I like to step into politics? If it isn't for that money... I wouldn't give a shit about the Boss. This is a tough world. I came here with a One-way Permit in 2003. Whatever I did, it went wrong. I was a cook, the restaurant closed down. When I was a construction worker, the labour was outsourced. No one will give a fuck even if we died. Then I tried to be a taxi driver. Then there was a Mandarin test. Public housing is the classic story. Submitted my application a decade ago, haven't heard back. The triad is the best career so far. Bill is the longest boss I've come across. It's still like a freelance job, even in the triads. I'm not listed for any big deals. And tons of others are competing for the petty jobs. You may say I'm aggressive, whatever. I just want to... ...have a stable job. Tell me about it. I'm not any better than you. You are young. You still got time to climb up the ladder. But I'm not, and I'm still running errands at my age. All we want is to make a living. You'll get 150 grand without doing or risking anything. Isn't it a good deal? Rest assured, Director. I have it all sorted out. It's flawless. King Chee will only get a minor wound. That's right! Damn! I don't know! Let's toss a coin. If it's heads, then it's your call. This is even better. Director, you really are the most insightful. Sure. I'll get it done. You just wait for the news tonight. Mayor Fei, this time your TMD is taking all the credit. Here's a tip, Tell Kam Wa to escort King Chee away from the scene. He will be in the spotlight just the same. West Point called. Now the order is, the more commotion, the better. The more Hong Konger panic, the better. We want them both. I got it. I will tell the colleagues to get ready. Sorry, Boss. I can't do it. Hairy, your luck has turned. The order is to shoot both of them, 500 grand each. One shot from each of you. Give them the stuff. What a rod! How's it going? Come on, let me help you. Hey, that's not the front. Right! I've thought about it. We play it safe. Rush out from the side. And make a few shots at the air. Then we shoot their legs if we're not taken down yet. Damn it, you are the man. Let's be partners from now on. I may need to go to India with you after this. Sure, no problem. A last bit here. We TMD and Fortune are convinced that... Labour is the most important to development. We are with all the Hong Kong people... ...striving a brighter future to our city. And thus making China more beautiful. Goodness of labour is always our merit of tradition. The element that's driving us... ...to becoming largest economical nation in the world. Thank you! Thank you! The next performance is... Square Dance! Let's welcome to them. The Labour Day celebration held by political parties... ...was attacked by terrorists. Two terrorists approached and fired at the councilors. Miss. Lam, King Chee & Mr. Yeung, Kam Wa. Terrorists were shot by police officers and died on the scene. Six shots were fired by the terrorists. Police provisionally considers... ...that it was a planned assassination. Both councilors were taken to the hospital for medical examination. In which no serious harm was found. All secretaries of the SAR were shocked by this incident. The Central Government announced a high degree of concern. The Liaison Office issued a statement... Condemning the unlawful actions of the terrorists. The police is highly commended for their prompt action. But it reflects that foreign powers have penetrated. Thus, the National Security Act shall proceed immediately. The National Security Law is necessary. Regarding a local and an ethnic minority attempted assassination. Government representatives said that... ...it might be instigated by the death of the Southern Asian youth... ...in a recent social movement. But few people believe otherwise... ...and claimed the terrorists as "martyrs". "This story doesn't sound real." "Eddie's house was destroyed by a bulldozer." "A group of escaped rebels have made Eddie's home, together with bricks from destroyed houses," "and other daily objects scattered around the city, into specimens." "An insect lives only one summer cannot be expected to know what ice is" Hey. Go to sleep, why don't you sleep? Do you think we can change the way humans sleep? I think... ...we can only decide to sleep or not to sleep. I don't think we can control the way we sleep or fall asleep. What if, someday, you don't need to sleep anymore - what would you do? I think I would lie on my bed, close my eyes... And revisit my dreams. I had a dream last night too, I saw Eddie and his room. We argued somehow, and he disappeared suddenly. A bulldozer destroyed the house, just like a few years ago. I hid under his table, waiting for the bulldozer to leave. But it never did. The dream went on. I couldn't help crawling out from under the table. It was no longer Eddie's house. But the hostel we lived in back in New Zealand. It was right in the middle of the earthquake-stricken area. The whole place was razed to the ground, it became a wasteland. But we contacted the hostel staff before we went there. This should be a ghost story. We kept walking around the rubble... ...I didn't want to, so I started crying. You told me to stop crying and walk faster. Then, we arrived at a hostel reconstructed from a suburban prison. We slept on a single bed. In the morning, we went back to the quake zone... ...and walked around the rubble for the whole day. And the day after as well, we kept walking. Go to sleep. Hmm "I had the same dream tonight." Your 2015 water bills are gone. Those aren't my letters. I know, I was making sure your letters aren't mixed up with other things. I will go take a look over there. Remember to make an order, we are running out of specimen boxes. Hmm. Why don't we take a walk? EY19? Bombax ceiba. VX6 Master Cheung's noodle scoop. What about TA52? "Gradually, there were more specimens than objects remaining in the city. "After making a new batch of specimens, including the steak, washing powder, the Nautilus "and campaign photos, not many specimen boxes are left." There were 14 left; 6 big ones, 8 small ones. Can we switch to carbon fiber cases? Carbon fiber cases deform in heat. It can't even withstand hot water... ...let alone fire. There are more than 8.7 million species on the earth now. But that only accounts for two percent of all the species that ever existed. Should we be more open-minded? Just as the world embraces death, and destruction. I'm starting to doubt, whether we know where we are going? If you knew from the start, would you make the same choice? "What I said this morning was, I order you to make me into a specimen, completely." Can you put things back properly? Cigarette ash is in DE, not DX! I'm talking to you. Are you talking about the ash, or about this morning? They are the same thing. Taxidermy is for what is dying and disappearing, not living things! What about me? Am I dying or living? Why are you doing this? I don't want to give up on my principles now. People out there think that what we're doing is out of nostalgia and obsession. But we're not, we've been doing something cruel all along. If we don't do it thoroughly, how will they understand? Are you out of your mind? We are talking about your life here. What we know and believe in now... ...will cease to be ours after death. If we let those go now... ...how are we different from people out there? Who are you doing this for? No one, I'm not doing it for anyone. I want you to make my specimen. You help me do it. Can you? At that time, you had a high fever, remember? We were having a meeting at Eddie's all night long. Every time we took a walk, you said you wanted to sleep earlier. Can it not be too early? I won't come back early ever again. Don't even dream about it. Does it hurt? This is how coagulant feels like, it should be reaching your liver now. Hey, how come only those specimens from BC to BT are missing? Did you hide them? Get them out. We are almost there. Hey, hey. Hey, open up. I feel younger. Hey. I want to take a walk. Let's go for a walk. I had a very long dream. I saw Eddie and his son. His son was healthy again, and was running around. We were fishing in a river. You know they're vegetarians. They caught them for us, to be made into specimens. Hey, did you hear me? I'm talking to you, can you respond a bit? Why are you like this all the time? Why is everything like this? Wong Ching. You're just not coming out, are you? Scientists in the Descartes faction struck dogs in cold-blood. They say animals are the same as clocks. Their cries of pain when struck... ...are equivalent to the clinging of springs or chimes. They don't feel anything. I've been thinking, these few years in this house with him. Did we think we were sounding chimes as well? From all the things we've struck. Did we produce clinging noises that won't ever be heard? "Cantonese, commonly referred to as Gwongdongwa "is the common spoken language in Hong Kong. "Its characteristics include borrowing terms from English and other languages. "It has unique vocabulary, colloquialisms, slangs, "Vulgarism, and special terminologies and jargon in different businesses." As a joint effort with China's Putonghua Universal Access Policy... ...all non-Putonghua speaking drivers that failed to pass the test... ...will not only be prohibited to pick up passengers at all border control points. Such as, the Airport and the Cruise Terminal. But also in Central, Admiralty and Kwun Tong business districts. Sports news, the twenty-sixth round of the Spain La Liga...

You speak to him in Putonghua all the time, but his grades aren't improving. If you don't learn Putonghua, you can't even be a taxi driver. You know what, I'll ask his Putonghua tutor to stay for an extra hour... ...and to teach you Putonghua. "Beckham" Speed camera locations: Clear Water Bay Road...

Just speak in Cantonese, I've been waiting for so long now. Come on, give me a hand, open the trunk. All drivers in there speak Putonghua, I don't know any of that. There was this terrible driver just now. He stared at me once I started speaking. Ten years ago, they learnt Cantonese to be here. Hey, why are you picking up passengers here? Is this your first day of work? Get a license if you want to do business here. I'm just trying to make a living, aren't we fellow men? Are you the only one making a living? Tell your passenger to leave, you hear me? No? Okay. Is this the Police? Hey, what are you doing? I want to make a report. Seriously? You are calling the police for that? Officer, give me a chance... ...or else my day's work will be for nothing. Yes, officer. It wasn't his fault that I insisted to take his taxi. Enough, no matter what, someone broke the law. I'm just executing the law. My client speaks Cantonese. Is speaking in Cantonese against the law now? "I Don't Understand" In... intangible assets, yes... Boss, perhaps I didn't explain clearly enough. The account... is... a bit... complicated. I will call to explain again. Director Zhou, hello? Fire me if you wish, I quit.

E.g. the Airport and the Cruise Terminal. But also in Central, Admiralty and Kwun Tong business districts. "The Qing government ceded Hong Kong to Britain in 1842." "The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984." "The UK transferred the sovereignty of HK to the People's Republic of China in 1997." "The PRC guaranteed Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy..." "...except in diplomatic and national security matters for 50 years." "After 2047, Hong Kong's future have to be re-discussed." "Hong Kong, 2025" This morning at 7:20, someone self-immolated outside the British consulate-General. The Police has sealed off the area. No comments so far on the identity or motive of the self-immolator. The self-immolator was certified dead in the hospital. Some reporters asked if this self-immolation is related to... ...the recent movements for Hong Kong Independence. The Police said no will was found at the scene. Further investigation is needed to learn the cause. "Self-Immolator" Self-immolation... ...is when you have absolutely no other way out. Who is the self-immolator? The reason why the government does not tell us that... ...besides the fact that investigation is needed. I believe is also related to Au-Yeung Kin Fung's death last week. Au-Yeung Kin Fung has always believed the UK government... ...should charge the PRC on the International Court of Justice... ...for continually killing Hong Kong's autonomy... ...violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration. For that he is seen as an extreme reactionary, unreasonable... ...irredeemable terrorist. They are responsible. Ever since the 70s, UN has been scared of the Chinese Communist Party. So they erased Hong Kong's identity as a colony. And without that identity, Hong Kong does not... ...have the right to self-determination. It cannot choose independently as other colonies can. To claim that Hong Kong wasn't a colony, is to lie. In 1971, the UN voted to expel the Republic of China... ...and admit the People's Republic of China... ...as the only legal representative of China. In 1972, the UN erased Hong Kong from the list of colonies to the bidding of China. Nave, Hong Kong is not capable of independence. This shouldn't even be thought about. Even the pan-democrats are against Hong Kong's independence. After the Riots of Independence in 2020. The Central Government was prompted to implement Article 23. It was no longer the responsibility of the Central Government... ...but the rebels. His advocation of Hong Kong Independence... ...has made him the first person to be prosecuted... ...for constituting an incitement to overthrow state power. On the fourth of this month, the 67th day of his hunger strike. He died in the prison cell, at the age of 21. The place of self-immolation is where Au-Yeung Kin Fung... ...desecrated the national flags of the UK and the PRC half a year ago. He has been dead for seven days. I think the self-immolator was definitely his supporter. Have you seen Karen? No. It was the self-immolation of a young man... ...that sparked off the Jasmine Revolution. Au-Yeung said the reason why Hong Kong does not have democracy... ...is because no one has died yet. Hey, you are not thinking of self-immolating, are you? If I really do that, what will you do? I will... kill you. Au-Yeung said the reason why Hong Kong does not have democracy... ...is because no one has died yet. Please support Hong Kong Independence. You are not even Chinese, stop speaking Cantonese. What a shame! I am a Hongkonger so I speak Cantonese! Just go home! Hong Kong is my home, I was born here! Go away, stupid Pakistani. Why did you touch me! Go away! Aren't you mad? You think I don't want to beat them up? All these years I've been working for citizens like him... ...to fight for justice. But if we hit them, we are no different. You think I don't want to? I still have faith in the British. Will the more civilized, moral Brits... ...come forward and fulfill their responsibilities? The Brits are violating the Joint Declaration... ...if they stay silent. They are both violating the Declaration, breaking international laws. So both parties are not qualified to possess sovereignty over HK. Then HK will have the right to declare independence. There will never be a true universal suffrage unless HK is independent. We have been wrestling with China for so many years. And suddenly he told us to not be bothered with China... ...and focus on the UK Government. Fighting is our only hope. But this is too sudden, thus hard to swallow... ...for the Hong Kong people. But undeniably... ...Au-Yeung Kin Fung is the first person... ...to sacrifice their life for Hong Kong's democracy. The self-immolator is like the second Au-Yeung... ...a threat to the Central Government... ...gaining more people's support for Hong Kong Independence. "Hong Kong Independence" Hong Kong's independence is a threat to the rule of the Communist Party. If the Communist Party is overthrown, it will be disastrous for China. In fact, secession from a country is good. The smaller the country, the higher the chance of its people being happy. The concept of unification is deep-rooted in Chinese... ...and the concept of centralization as well. In short, they lose face! How could Chinese, being slaves for thousands of years... ...understand this? Try asking people if they want democracy. I guess most answers will be... ...I'd rather have a dictatorship. If we want happiness for the Chinese people... ...we need to set a good example... ...like a father would to his son... ...so that my son can learn from me, and grow to maturity! If my son beats people, and lies. I should let him know. Taking into consideration HK's level of civilization and maturity. Hong Kong should be the father. But we must be careful... ...the evilness of the Communist Party exceeds our imagination. Is this Poon Yiu Fai from Fai Kee Hardware? Yes. This is a police warrant, please open the door. Regarding the self-immolation this morning... ...the gas can we found at the scene bears your shop's contacts. The self-immolator? We now suspect you are an accomplice. You need to stay here for the time being. I don't know him. He came and bought from me, that's it. I don't know him. I know you don't know him. If I am to self-immolate, I would do it at the British Consulate-General. Marco! Where is Karen? Tell me! Is she okay? Calm down. You won't get any reaction from China. Look at Tibet, so many monks self-immolated. So many of them died, did it work? Au-Yeung's method is right. We should be fighting for the support of the British Government. The British people don't give a damn. That's Au-yeung's problem always begging the Brits. He isn't begging, he's protesting. Same as what you are doing, protesting against China. Marco! Independence Union will set fire to the Liaison Office tonight. Don't go. Stay here. Marco! They have your girlfriend, and still you won't go with us? I'm not going. It's because of you that she's captured right now. Are you blaming us instead of the Communist Party? I don't know what Karen sees in you. Hong Kong is at a standstill, and everything's ruined... ...because of so called 'non-violent civil disobedience'. If you say they are still upholding the Declaration... ...reread its terms, it states clearly that... all except diplomatic and national security matters... ...are none of the Communist Party's business. They are the ones breaking the law, not us. Look around you, it's all wrong. To be frank, if I may be so bold... ...we are their bitch. The self-immolation is fake. The whole thing could be staged by the Communist Party... ...to tarnish the Independence Movement... ...and be justified to subdue it. This has been used on Falun Gong... ...and the East Turkestan Independence Movement before. Authorities have yet to announce the identity of the self-immolator... ...because it wants to act accordingly... ...to the reaction of the Hong Kong people... ...whether to stick to their script and call him an advocate of Independence... ...or mentally ill. The Central Government has been flaming the Independence Movement... ...which seems contradictory. This is the paradox of the Independence Movement. It triggers hatred... ...breaks the opposing faction apart... ...and benefits the Central Government in the end. If the self-immolation is fake, I want to know... ...who would do this for the Central Government? There is something special about Chinese people... ...they can do anything for money. What I've learnt the most these few decades... ...is conspiracy theories. What I've lost... ...is trust. Another possibility is that... ...this person was tricked by the Party... ...into believing that he would just be staging it. Therefore, this is not a suicide. This is murder. The self-immolator is confirmed to be a HK citizen and supporter of Independence. A police press conference will be held in an hour. to account for investigation progress. You can stay here, I need to go pick up my daughter. Don't make this difficult for me, I'm just doing my job. This is my home. Your home is under our rule. What do you want? I can't even make a phone call. I will come back after I pick up my daughter. What do you want? Damn it! What's wrong with you? My daughter has been dismissed from school already. The old SAR's government used to fight for people's support. But now, it is the same as the Central Government... ...bringing only fear to its people. Of course they are terrified. The Party launders its money and transfers its assets here in HK. What do gangsters care about most? Money. You keep calling the Communist Party gangster, aren't you afraid? What about you? Aren't you afraid? How can you broadcast this footage? Article 23 has now been implemented. I actually don't fully agree with your story. Secret police in suits? The Party would definitely turn to the gangsters for their dirty work. Christian body, Justice Doer, has called Christians and citizens... ...to join their prayer meeting in front of the British Consulate-General. With candles in their hands, all are deep in prayer. The number of participants has increased significantly compared to the service for u-Yeung Kin Fung last week. We don't need repeated accusations. We need tangible actions. We plead that the UK put forward a motion to the UN... ...to include HK in the UN Trust Territory. So that HK people may have a shot at universal suffrage. Christian, also known as Protestant... ...are people who protest. The church should not... We are now at the Liaison Office. A group of protesters barged into the Office building. There is a clash between the protesters and the guards. As we can see, protesters have set fire to the Liaison Office. I need to get my daughter. I need to get my daughter. Daddy! I have nothing to do with the self-immolation. The SAR Government sees protests for Independence as a diplomatic matter... ...and requested assistance from People's Liberation Army. The Army's tanks are now in Central... ...heading towards both British Consulate-General and Liaison Office. The Communist Party has built a country upon hatred. And they sustained their power with hatred. The more chaotic HK is, the better it is for them. Turn it off. Have you ever heard of the quote from... ...the ultimate pro-Beijing politician, Raymond Wu? No? If HK people know they are being raped by the Communist Party... ...why not just lie down and enjoy it? Hong Kong people seem to hate these words. But for these two, three decades... ...their attitude towards the Communist Party... ...is to wallow in degeneration. Ten years ago, in the Umbrella Movement, people claim to have seen hope. I don't see any of that. Au-Yeung is pursuing the impossible. I spend most of my strength everyday... ...not to fight hunger... ...but to suppress my anger for the Communist Party. I'm not in a place to command you. I just want to make the right choices. I am calm. It's not hatred that keeps me going... ...but hope. How is Au-Yeung's peaceful protest radical? It's just natural to fight for independence when facing dictatorship. For all these years that the Central Government has ruled us... ...we have lost a lot. If we don't fight back... I've a principle. It's not about whether it's possible. It's about whether it's right or wrong. No! Stop! No! Stop! Is independence the only way to democracy in Hong Kong? Self-immolation is not necessarily a desperate move. It could be a flame to light up hope. It is courage, responsibility and honor. China does not lie. If we are obliged by the Joint Declaration. If we uphold the Basic Law... ...we don't need independence. It's a pity that we don't trust the Communist Party anymore. We shouldn't have trusted it, all along. With the loss of my life... ...this is how I make my stance. It is the most radically gentle way of doing it. Chaos at the British Consulate-General and the Liaison Office are yet to be solved. Could the protest triggered by self-immolation... ...be a means to an end, or a beginning to a new movement regarding the future of Hong Kong? Their sacrifice was not worth it. They thought they were doing good, but they weren't. It's basic human responsibility to stand up against injustice. Morality should be the foundation of politics. The biggest flaw of the Chinese people is selfishness. Sacrifice? I used to see a granny, already at her eighties, at the protest scenes. She has been through the Cultural Revolution, June Fourth Incident. She would often encourage me... ...not to lose heart because of other people. As humans, we need to fight. I hope I can live up to that. Sam? This is Cheung. I just want to let you know that my farm is closing. I'll bring you my last batch of eggs later... Dad, have you seen my uniform? Just over there. When is Youth Guard ending today? No idea, 5 or maybe 6 o'clock. What is the Youth Guard doing today? No idea, we never know beforehand. Hmm, off you go Sam? This is Cheung. I just want to let you know my farm is closing. I'll bring you my last batch of eggs later. It's just a small batch though. You may need to source your eggs elsewhere. In 2025, Hong Kong's Last Chicken Farm Closed Down Sam! Cheung! Didn't I say I would bring the eggs to you? Heard that you are closing and wanted to come take a look. I haven't come here since your dad passed away. It's not that I want to close the farm, Sam, I'm forced to. This time they say we use the farm against the government. Huh? That's ridiculous. You and your father did whatever they asked. So compliance didn't do you any good either. My father only wanted one simple thing. Local chicken for Hong Kong people. Local food for Hong Kong people. These few years they told us to build this, and tear down that. We obliged for a few years. Just to gradually realize that they are killing us off. So what's your plan? Life is quite unexpected. Some people in Taiwan invited me to start a farm there. They want to use my tech and systems to develop a farm there. So I'm leaving soon. That's good. Sam, would you come and help? It's not as easy as that. Think about it. These are the last ones. If Ming finishes them, come find me, okay? Hey! What is it about this time? Do you have to take photos? Hey! Commander told us to look out for anything against the rules. If we see it, we take a photo of it. Which rule did I break? Commander said, all words from this list need to be recorded. Is selling eggs illegal? No, but the word 'local' is against the rules. Okay, what does 'local' mean? From Hong Kong. What does 'local egg' mean? Eggs from Hong Kong. So is there a problem if I write 'Hong Kong egg' here? Hong Kong... No problem. The same egg, problematic when it's called 'local egg'. But no problem when it is a 'Hong Kong egg'? Where's the logic in that? No idea, whatever, I'm going to record anything against the rules. Think it through when you have no idea. Don't just do exactly as you are told. I know it's a lot cheaper... ...but my customers just don't trust that. You cannot fool people with cheap food. Ha... that's right, so what about Thai eggs? How many do I need to order to get delivery? If I order from you, can you give me a discount? Yes I understand, let me think about it and get back to you. Okay, thank you. Any reply slips to sign today? Yes. This one? Yes, and this one. Youth Guard Commander is authorized to assign your son's covert operations. Parents are not necessarily informed. What does it mean, 'not necessarily informed'? Hey, today those Youth Guards came and took lots of pictures... ...holding a piece of paper and said I am against the rules. Do you know what that's about? Yeah, the Youth Guard issued a Non-recommended List. The word 'local' is against the rules. What Non-recommended List? Show me. I don't have it. Put the book down. Why don't you have it? Is everything covert now? You are not telling me anything? Ming, you have been eating eggs from Cheung's Farm ever since you were little. I don't care what others say. There is nothing wrong with eating or selling his eggs. The fault is in those who accuse others for no reason. Are we clear? Yes. Look at me. No matter what, don't just follow others blindly. Think before you act, okay? Okay. Hey! What are you guys doing? Ming, what are you doing? I didn't throw anything. I'm obliged to come, I don't know what I should do. Come on, let's clean this up. Sam, whenever Ming receives those guidelines, or lists... ...he hands them to me. I rented this place with some other customers to store 'contraband'. Then the collection got bigger. Now, we got more books here than in the shop. It is Ming who told me they were coming. So I closed the gate, and just let them be. Actually it was the same before the Youth Guard. Grown-ups were here to mess around. I'm used to it now. Never ever get used to it. It's precisely because our generations got used to it... ..that you have to live like this now. How can they think they can ban things from existence? Right, even Doraemon is banned. Idiots.
