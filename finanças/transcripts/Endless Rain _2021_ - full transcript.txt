[Kim Kiwon's "Still Waiting" playing] KANG HA-NEUL CHEON WOO-HEE ♪ Watching my cold breath Counting my heartbeat ♪ ♪ Looking left and right Still ♪ ♪ How could I be smiling Just by picturing ♪ ♪ You standing here with me... ♪ [Young-ho] Two days ago, snow fell in a desert for the first time in 112 years. A lot of penguins died in the South Pole due to heavy rainfall yesterday. I'm hoping for something with very low probability. Had I not given up math in school, I'd not be in this predicament. As a kid, I used to think that raindrops were God's tears. This childish thought lasted until 6th grade. This story is about waiting. December 31, I'm waiting for rain. Probability is very low. WAITING FOR RAIN THE RAINY DAY PITTER-PATTER SONG OF THE RAIN -Here, take this. -Okay. Could you put him down? -What's his name? -It's Blessing. Blessing. Blessing, here you go. You put it under the belly, -there's a buckle over here. -I see. Hold on to this and push it down. [woman] So cute! And take the handle. Try walking together. Let's go, Blessing. -Bye, Blessing. -Thank you. -Come back if there's a problem. -[woman] Okay. [pleasant music playing] Blessing... Good morning. SPRING, 8 YEARS AGO [clears throat] Welcome. Some of you may know me from last year. Third attempts, hands up. You should be ashamed! The way I see it, you're part of nature. Which nature, you ask? Sedimentary rocks. You're stupid like a rock, all piled up together. Kids, I've been doing this for 20 years, and I start with the same advice. Throw that book out the window and escape from this. It's better to learn about the real world ASAP. We are filled with hope until the day we die. Life is simple, only a few will succeed, and many will fail. Are you former or latter? Former or latter? [student] Former? Look behind you. You're one of many, it's so obvious! You all will fail. "Will my life be any different?" You're not a snowflake. All right, $1000 again this year. Full refund for this class and youth aid. Whoever gives up first takes the money. Ah, thank you. -Here you go. -[vendor] Thank you. Ma'am, I'm gonna have some soup. Didn't we take the same prep class last year? Not sure, miss. We're the same age, relax. Mind if I have one? I forgot my wallet. -One tempura, please. -Okay. [Soo-jin] It'd have been good, if we didn't meet again, right? Do you really think we'll die with only hope? You don't look like a pessimist. You really don't remember me? Easily distracted, huh? -Ma'am, I ate two. -[vendor] Okay. -You taking the bus or subway? -Holy cow... You don't have bus fare either? [laughs] I'll pay for the fare. By the way, do you know my name? I know yours. World's most common name. Oh. Thank you. Could this be fate? Think about it. Why else would we meet two years in a row? It's not fate, we simply failed to get into college. So you don't believe in fate? Believing in fate brings spark to your life. Bus will come right away too. [bus brakes hiss] [pleasant music playing] Jeez... [clears throat] [engine stalls] [engine sputtering] I know your name too, it's just as common. [engine starts] LEATHER WORKSHOP MAN-DOL [man] Father, listen to me and sell the business. The value will double and triple, so why bother? -Young-hwan. -Yes? Isn't having a salary job better than starting a business? When will I ever buy you a Mercedes with my salary? You worked hard for 30 years. Trust me and enjoy a comfortable life. -[door opens, bell jingles] -[Young-ho] I'm back! I'll head up! [Young-hwan] You failed to get into college again? If this is your third attempt, the answer's obvious. You'll never get into an in-Seoul college. Seoul colleges aren't everything. You're being arrogant again. Just move out, then, asshole. Earn your keep or die trying. How long can Father work his butt off to support you? Will you stop it? [sighs] You got no goals in life. What do you exactly live for? Not to be like you at your age! You're too thick to realize how tough this world is. It seems easy, right? Pay for your own damn class. Got it? [door opens] [door closes] [sighs] PROJECT IN-SEOUL COLLEGE [pen scribbles] [pen scratches] [pen clatters] [whistle blows faintly] [children clamoring faintly] -[whistle blows] -[drum pounding] [children clamoring] [winces] GONG SO-YEON [tender music playing] But I'm blue. Here it is, dude, stay with me, okay? Initialize and sign in the circles. This feels really expensive. You bumpkin! We're in the 21st century, and yet, this is your first phone? Don't shit your pants. It looks ordinary, right? -Go horizontal! -Holy shit! -Revolutionary! -It looks so dope in person! I get goosebumps whenever I do that. [laughing] It feels so natural, doesn't it? Listen, dude. [clears throat] There's something I want to ask you. -It's not that expensive! -No, no... You have to sign up now to get 10% discount! It's not that... Look at your shit face, fine, three months free, boom! It's not that! Do you remember Gong So-yeon from elementary school? Gong So-yeon? Gong So-yeon... -Didn't she transfer? -Yeah! What about her? Can you ask your mom for her contact info? -My mom? -Yeah. She's still teaching there. She became the vice principal. Could she find out which school she went to? Or even an address... [splutters] Are you lonely? Is life tough? No, I got something to return to her. [pleasant music playing] BUSAN LITERARY FRIEND BOOKSTORE I MISS YOU Check before buying, they're filled with doodles. When you get old, your eyes won't work like before. Hmm. Then go to the optometrist. I'd rather die than rely on hospitals. You just make things worse. Take it easy tonight, I'll go see sis. Mom, are you disappointed that I didn't go to college? I never expected you to go in the first place. You "couldn't go," not "didn't go." [sighs] She got a scholarship through studying alone, what's wrong with my genes? Don't blame the genes. She had dreams, you didn't. I had dreams too. What dream? Daydream? Be a doctor like Schweitzer! A doctor for humanity! Make a living off other people's diseases? What a pessimist. You mean "cynic." It's not this world's fault. It's the damn people in it. You should remarry. Your crooked mind came from living alone. Hi, I'm Gong So-yeon's guardian. Wait, are you So-hee? Gong So-hee? Yes, hello. It's been a while. A letter came for her. Since you're here, take her reading material. Department shirt's here too. -Here. -Thank you. How is So-yeon? Can she come back? [upbeat music playing] LITERARY FRIEND BOOKSTORE BUSAN UNIVERSITY GONG SO-YEON [So-hee] You got a letter. Shall I read it for you? [bell dings] [So-hee] Forgive me for opening your letter. I've never actually seen a stamped letter before. So people still write handwritten letters. Here it goes. "Dear So-yeon." Ooh. Great start, maybe it's your friend. "Hello." TO GONG SO-YEON DEAR FELLOW ALUMNA DEAR SO-YEON [Young-ho] Hello. I hope you're not too surprised by my sudden letter. MAIL SEOUL - REGIONAL We went to the same elementary school, but never in the same class, so you might not remember me. -Oh. I'm sorry. -Oh. Sorry. [pleasant music playing] [bell dings] [bell dings] [bell dings] More letters? [So-hee] Want some water? Hold on. I'M SORRY, I DON'T REMEMBER YOU. So freaking annoying. Why did we get this stupid homework? How do we know what whoever's waiting for? This is so freaking nuts. What's a Godot? Something to do with God? Should we just freaking not do it? -Not do it? -Excuse me. Girls? Read this, it's my gift to you. Who are you? I don't need it. No, you must read it. Only then, your breath will smell like roses, and your life will be mellifluous. Read it! No matter what! What the hell! So freaking annoying! You devils... Vile devils! [So-hee] I'm sorry! Hey! Nerd! Are you nuts?! You're the same as them! [huffs] What did you say? "Nerd" is politically incorrect. Get with the times, who uses that word? [So-hee] You liked being called that. Then what should I call you? How about... "bookworm"? What the hell? Like a nerd but in English. It does sound cool. [scoffs] What an idiot. [in English] Bookworm. [pleasant music playing] Who gave you your name? Who else? Your grandfather. Are you implying that my name is old-fashioned? To be honest, a little. It's like a servant's name. Idiot, it was trendy back then. Man-dol, Keun-dol, Seok-dol. Can I ask you something else? What? Which is more important when studying, talent or effort? Studying is all about talent. Your lazy brother proved that. Then should people do what they love, or love what they do? A wise man once said, "There's more hardship after hardship." You could've offered something more hopeful. Nothing is ever easy, so do something you like. So, what do you enjoy doing? [So-hee] Bookworm, you're really going to sleep here? No time to sleep. To read 100,000 books before I die, I gotta read five a day. Wouldn't it be better to meet a few friends in that time? You live your life alone. If I were to ever need a friend, one would do. No male friends or girlfriends, either way, it's tragic. Having no friends is not a tragedy. A sunny day isn't always a good day, and a rainy day isn't always a bad day. Indeed. HELLO. I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER YOU. I THINK YOU'VE MISTAKEN ME FOR ANOTHER STUDENT... BUSAN CENTRAL POST OFFICE [pensive music playing] [So-hee] I think I remember you. Thank you for the letter, though. I'd like to propose a few ground rules. Do not ask questions, don't ask to meet up. And no visiting. Take care. From So-yeon. [buoyant music playing] [So-hee] Are you asleep? I brought a cute little puppy. Your friend made it, he's good, right? Happy, bark. [imitates dog barking] He's your guardian dog from now on. Like it? MAIL [So-hee] I'll cast a spell that'll make you look up at the sky. [buoyant music continues] What the... [exclaims] [So-hee] Thanks for the puppy, I placed it by my pillow. He's so quiet, doesn't bark at all. It's reassuring to have him beside me. I love the name Happy too. I hope you're happy as well. P.S. End of the spell, you may now look down. -[music stops] -[Soo-jin] What are you looking at? Clouds. I didn't know you like clouds. It could be an animal or a face. Or a message from the universe, "You two should spend the day together." Why'd the universe plan such a silly thing? Aren't you surprised? About what? Miracle of the universe. What miracle? In the void of this universe, we're both staring at the sky. Everything's a miracle to you. Yeah, that's it, everything's a miracle. These fleeting moments... If this moment returns, it's a proof that we're rocks. Sedimentary rocks? [both laugh] Are you a shut-in loner, or are you just waiting for a muse in those books? Ma'am. You're the only muse in my life. Give me artistic inspiration and talent. He's got good eyes. [scoffs] Don't make me puke. Let us ignore fools like her. She's an argument against spirituality. I think so too. Coming together of a pessimist and a cynic. This should be interesting. I'm going to meet a woman like you. Like a shower on a patch of soil. Hmm. Soil and shower? It is the start of life. It's just mud, you idiot. Just live alone. Okay. [scoffs] Please listen to me. The value will double in a few months, you can work in a much better workshop. [Man-dol] This is enough, I don't need anything better. I'm off. [Man-dol] Okay. Trust your good son on this one. Fine, when do you need it by? If you're taking money from the family, it's obvious. Piss off, moron. He shouldn't work his butt off to support you. You're a grown-up. Buddy! What did you say? The world is so easy because you're so smart? [Young-hwan] I've had it with you. I know you're the shit. That's why you wore the letterman jacket for 4 years. Never once washed it, not knowing how badly it stank. Punk-ass bitch! [tender music playing] "A bird without legs has landed." Did you see Days of Being Wild? I saw A Chinese Ghost Story for the actress. Doesn't he look like he's crying even though he's laughing? That's why I'm drawn to him. PLEASE REMEMBER ME, DON'T FORGET ME. My brother looked like Leslie. But he died as a high school senior. Wanna stay with me today? It'd be easy to remember today, the day Leslie Cheung died. Ma'am, how much for a room? Day use? What's that? Short rest. Oh. Then I'll take a long rest. $40. [Soo-jin] I was always curious, there's nothing to it. [water running] [whispers] It's see-through... Good hot water flow. How about this? Whenever we sleep, I'll tell you about my moms. It's a decent roster. My dad had his way with women. Oh. We could probably sleep four times just by doing that. [scoffs] Forget it! Hmm... My real mom is up first. She had a C-section and the scalpel stabbed my ear. See this? It's not an earring hole. That cut must've ruined your personality. We got a $30,000 settlement, though. As soon as I was born, I was filthy rich. When I was grade 8 or so, I was given a bank book. With interest added up over 20 years, it's at $43,000. I'm serious. For the first time ever, I said thank you. A month after giving me this, she passed away. She cleaned her slate before dying. Thanks to that, dad's second marriage was easy. [tender music playing] I'll save the second mom for the next time. I won't sleep with you, rich lady. But I want to sleep with you. What's with that face? Is that your college rejection face? Let's go see the aurora when we get in. [scoffs] Yeah! Iceland! The cold will make it nice to snuggle. [sighs] Is that all you think about? I think I missed something growing up. Maybe lack of nutrients. What was I saying? Right, the aurora, we have to go see it. [starter pistol fires] [panting] [laughing] LITERARY FRIEND BOOKSTORE SUMMER [man] Excuse me? -Yes? -[man] Do you buy these too? How about $1 per album? [Yeoch's "To My Old Friend" playing on stereo] [So-hee] I'm listening to music. A stranger sold me this vinyl. I think I calculated wrong, here you go. It's okay. Uh, the albums were in Pop Top Ten for five weeks. We pay extra for chart toppers. Take care. [So-hee] I think I heard this in elementary school, I guess I liked it enough to remember it. Why did you pay him more? Well... It didn't feel right to pay $1 each for these. [So-hee] Aside from birthday cards, I've never written a proper letter. I drove by the ocean by chance today. I live so close to it, but I rarely go. You might not hear it, but I'm filling this letter with the sound of the South Sea. Have a great day. ["To My Old Friend" continues] Overthinker, what are you thinking about? [clears throat] The ocean. Already feeling the summer? I don't remember it. -[Soo-jin] Come with me. -What? [Young-ho] Hey, hey! Hold up, what's with you? I'm gonna trip! Taxi? What for?! Wait, where are we going? Sir, to the closest ocean, please! What? Right now?! [Soo-jin] It's not like the ocean is on the moon. Come on, let's go feel the tide. You're gonna go in? [tranquil music playing] [Young-ho] I should be solving a math problem right now. [Soo-jin] Calculate this instead. The probability of me and you barefoot on a habitable planet in this universe. [Young-ho chuckles] You really are different. [Soo-jin] It's society's fault for not letting us do this. I am irrefutably normal. [Young-ho] It's my first time seeing the ocean in my 20s. [Soo-jin] Me too, actually. Why are you so nice to me? [Soo-jin] Hmm... You may be a bit stupid, but I prefer someone who is untainted. [grunting] [Young-ho] Jeez, grab my hand. "Stupid" being the operative word? [moans] [Soo-jin laughing] I'm so screwed! Jesus Christ! Are you nuts? No! Don't do that! Stop! Don't do that! [shrieks] [both laughing] Look at this mess! Delivery. -[So-hee] Oh. One moment. -Sure. -Thank you. -Take care. [So-hee] Sis, look at this. He got these from the ocean. [tender music playing] [So-hee] Ta-da. Pretty good, right? Does he want you to ride this to the ocean? So pretty, aren't they? Wanna hear it? Listen. [waves rushing faintly] [So-hee] Do you hear it? Pardon, make way, please. [grunting] One moment. Use your strength! Your strength! -Hold it tight! -One second! [So-hee] A long day finally came to an end. I got your gift from the ocean, thank you. I hope it rains tonight. We have a drought here. I hope it rains all day. Gently, softly, tap-tap, pitter-patter. FROM SO-HEE [pen scratching] [Young-ho] So-yeon, you must love rain a lot. I love it too. Especially the raindrops on the eaves. When I was young, I used to watch that for a long time. PITTER-PATTER I like the sound of "pitter-patter." It makes me feel good. Pitter-patter. [dings] I WANT TO [bell dings] [bell dings] [pen scratching] I WANT TO MEET HIM [pensive music playing] JUNE MOCK EXAM: D- Man... Oh. [door opens, bell jingles] -[young woman] Excuse me. -Yes? Is it okay to look around? Of course, feel free to browse. [sewing machine whirring] [buoyant music playing] [door opens, bell jingles] [So-hee's mother] Welcome. THE LIFE BEFORE Excuse me? [gasps] Yes? That edition's translation is terrible, hold on a second. This is the revised edition. [tender music playing] LITERARY FRIEND BOOKSTORE PITTER-PATTER UMBRELLA WORKSHOP [door closes] [Soo-jin] I read about you in a magazine. A master umbrella maker, huh? [Young-ho chuckles] So the marketing worked. Have you been well? Lame attempt at being a travel writer. It feels like yesterday when we last met. I remember that dumb look of yours. What look? When I ate two fish cakes, you had that "Who is this crazy?" look. I remember. "Not bad for a crazy" look, right? No, it ended with "Who is this crazy?" [Soo-jin] You wore blue and white team hats too? I may have been the last generation. Mm. Do you have a rainmaker in the family? No. Then I'll pray for rain every day. You'll be rich soon. I'll go bankrupt if it does. People won't lose their umbrellas. I guess so. [tender music playing] Did you ever think of me? [Young-ho chuckles softly] Leslie Cheung's movies don't play as often. [Young-ho chuckles] Your sense of humor has improved. You're all grown up now. Bye. [woman on TV] How long have we known each other? A long time, I've forgotten. [woman] My cousin's getting married soon. [man] Really? Give her my best wishes. AUTUMN [man on radio] ...love others than themselves. When they meet someone... Mom, So-yeon smiled today. What do you mean? She smiled. Did something good happen? Mm, something like that. [man] ...enjoyed a little happiness. Let's hear a request from birthday girl Lee Young-kyung. [slow pop music playing on radio] Mom, why is my birthday December 31? What do you mean why? That's when you were born. I know. I could've been a year younger if you delayed getting my birth certificate by a day. Really untactful! If you feel wronged, blame your dad in heaven. He was the one who filed it. He was never really tactful. Thanks to that, I started at age 2. [sighs] My life started off on the wrong foot. Yeah, life's all messed up. No husband, a sick child, and the remaining one is immature. My life is all used up, like the books we're selling. What's with you? I was kidding. I lost to this world. It was such a vile thing. I talked to the doctor yesterday. What did he say? He told me to be mentally prepared. That's a doctor's most generous expression. He'll now use proper lingo. Name of the disease, cause and time of death... Stop talking like that! How long does she have? A month. [horn honks] [Young-hwan] Go! All moved out? Dad lived here for 30 years. We'll get him a good apartment soon. By playing the stock market? When he gets old, will you live with him? Then shut up. What was your SAT history score? Perfect score. You know history so well, but not about our family. [Young-hwan] Just stop it, asshole. Learn how the world works. Bookworm. Yes? I take back what I said. Take what back? Telling you to live by yourself. Fall in love while you're young. And stop coming here. Give writing a go. I got nothing to write about. I don't even have a single friend. In grade school, no one wanted me on their teams. I can never forget what a girl said. What did she say? "Hey, you can have him." I was always treated like expired milk. Fucking bitch. Forget about it. There isn't even time for those you treasure. I can't relate to anyone in this world. I never rode a bike as a kid, like others. But you surely have a dream. Ooh. You got time to read a novel? Some moron ripped out the last page. Did you know it's missing? Do you know what the last line is? That's the key point. No, I haven't even read the first sentence. It's because you buy books for looks. I'll write down the final sentence. [Young-ho] I'm gonna stop coming here. Why? My brain can't keep up. YOU MUST LOVE [sighs] Go home. Yo, Bookworm, why do you look so down? I'm afraid. Of what? The real world. Did something happen? I won't come to your shop anymore! [So-hee] What? What do you mean? Yo, Bookworm! Bookworm! [So-hee] Sis, should we take a picture? Well, one, two, three! [clicks] [melancholy music playing] [So-hee] We had a big snowfall yesterday in Busan. I'm sending you a handful. But it's only visible to kind souls. Oh! [laughs] [buoyant music playing] [Young-ho] I want to work up the courage to tell you something. There's something I've been lying to you about. If you give me a chance, I want to show you my better self. -[man] Forty-three, please. -Yes. Could we meet on December 31? In front of our old school, perhaps? Although it's gone now. COULD WE MEET ON DECEMBER 31? [melancholy music playing] [So-hee] Have you forgotten our rules? I'm sorry to say, I can't make that promise. FROM YOUNG-HO P.S. MY NUMBER IS 018... [cell phone buzzing] [buzzing continues] Hello? I have to see you now. If we suddenly lose contact, we'll remember each other only as one-night-stand partners. That's not proper. If we spend two nights, it'll feel much better. Okay, good night. Go to bed early and be a good boy. [Young-ho] Hey! Why won't you let me sleep? Because I'm lonely. [Soo-jin] Want me to tutor you? I won't charge. [Young-ho scoffs] Forget it, it's a waste of time. I don't want your sympathy or pity either. [Soo-jin] Don't beat yourself up. You have something more valuable. -Which is? -Imagination. [sighs] That's why I can't go to college? Imagination towards people. Can't you use some of that on me? Um... This was my elementary school. Really? It was demolished a long time ago. There weren't any new students. I think the classroom was here. Young-ho! Come solve this problem. Very good. Jong-gook, did you forget again? You did this dozens of times. Go put your hands up outside. Come on, Mom! Go outside. [Jong-gook sighs] LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE Young-ho, did you also forget? What is the meaning of lowest common multiples? Common numbers... I told you to think in simple terms. 4, 8 and 14. At what point do multiples of these numbers meet? So where do they first meet? The fountain? [students laughing] Homework check time, turn to page 17. Hurry, hurry... There you go. What a great job! You solved them well. Is she really my mom? We learn because we don't know! [Jong-gook sighs] [melancholy music playing] [sighs] -[Jong-gook] Hey, we should report her. -[teacher] You did a good job. [Jong-gook] Go call the police. [sighs] [teacher] That's enough, come inside. Are you really going to report her?! [Soo-jin] I can go alone from here. [Young-ho] Yeah, okay. We've spent two nights now, bye. Young-ho! I've thought about it... the lowest common multiple of 4, 8 and 14 is 56. [bell dings] What is it? Uncomfortable? Wanna say something? [bell dings] Okay, hold on. Did you have a bad dream? Nothing bad will happen. It's okay. [tender music playing] Go back to sleep. Want me to read to you? [So-hee] Dear friend, you asked if we could meet. Yes, I'd like to meet you. I WANT TO LIVE But I have also lied to you, so I want to be ready. [sobs softly] Let's meet on December 31 if it rains. That's the only promise I can make to you. No more questions, let's do that. Do me this favor. [tender music continues] [tender music continues] [inaudible dialogue] [So-hee] My sister was given a month to live, but she held on for much longer. Some said it was a miracle, others said it was the power of love. [So-hee] I didn't open these. I thought you should keep them for yourself. GONG SO-YEON I'm going to stop working and leave for a while. Can you take care of yourself? I don't know. It won't be easy. The world is becoming faster and more glamorous. They'll shun shabby bookstores like ours. [So-hee] My sister passed away due to a chronic illness. I, her sister, have been writing you the letters. MAIL I'm sorry. I didn't intend any harm. Please forgive me. [ethereal music playing] ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ [woman on recording] This is the weather forecast for Metro Seoul area.

Hold on, I'll pack my bag. [Young-ho] No! I gotta go soon. I'm going to Japan tomorrow. Why there? To learn a trade. When will you be back? [inhales] Hmm. It could take a long time. Will you call me? Good luck with the exam this year. I'm off. Go back to studying. What's... the difference between she and I? What difference? [Soo-jin] Tell me. Hmm... You're like the star... and she's like the rain. What does that mean? [Young-ho] You burn brightly, but she gives me comfort. [melancholy music playing] What... it doesn't comfort you that it won't rain on my star? [both chuckle] Bye. [Soo-jin shouting] Wanna be pen pals too?!

WINTER, 2011 A cave, an empty cave. Your brain's empty, so are your wallets. Oh, no need to edit this. So are your wallets, and your hopes too. [sighs] No one's giving up this year? It's mine, then. [students laugh] There was just one guy who took the offer. Who knows what he's up to after giving up the books. I know you and I will die filled with hope. But what can you do? You have to wait until hope arrives. If not, go after it, you idiots. [students chuckle] [teacher] Have a good exam. Don't get nervous! Good luck! Go on, eat. I haven't treated you in a while. No, it's the first time ever. Yeah? How could you eat right now? Even through tears, you still gotta eat. Divorces aren't anything special nowadays. What about your kids? They want to go with the ex. You should still make some memories with them. Memories are bought. Do you think kids nowadays want a poor dad? You know shit about kids. What'll you do now? Elites don't stay down, I won't die off. Eat up! [sighs] [Young-ho] Dude. Take this. You made it? Pretty good. This is embarrassing. You got a thing for "in-Seoul." You're something else. Grammar's all wrong. "Love in Seoul"? How could I use this? [gasps] You had thick skin before. Youth is all about being proud. I thought you owned the world back then. What's your dream now? [Young-ho] Me? Same as always, not to be like you in ten years. You're not that stupid, just think too much. I'm off. Have plenty of love in Seoul.

Yeah, you know. I only make puppy umbrellas. [chuckles] You learned the craft only to make that? Pets are part of the family these days. By the way, what are you making? Puppy boots. [Man-dol] I told you I don't need a sign, why did you order it? [Young-ho] What? What sign? LEATHER WORKSHOP MAN-DOL [Soo-jin] My dad passed away a few days ago. [Young-ho] I didn't know, I'm sorry.

Why'd heaven cry for a guy who married four times? [both chuckling] We were together on April Fool's Day. I told you it'd be easy to remember. OUT OF BUSINESS ANIMATION, VIDEO Take it, it's a gift. PITTER-PATTER UMBRELLA WORKSHOP Wow! [chuckles] What an honor! This is one of a kind, right? [Young-ho chuckles] Yes. [tender music playing] Do you remember when I said... the reason why I liked you? Because I'm stupid? No. You look like you're crying even when laughing. It's so pretty. Thank you, I'm off. [Soo-jin] There had to be a time when nothing existed. No stars, no wind, no clouds. And from that void, we crossed paths, became friends, laughed and cried. What other miracles will there be in this universe? [Young-ho clears throat] How... did your brother... Suicide. His grades tanked in 12th grade, he had a crush. [melancholy music playing] He told her he liked her, but she only said hurtful things. Like what? "I'm not even remotely curious about you." I have yet to hear a more hurtful phrase. Are you also not curious about me? It's okay. I got super thick skin. Ahh. Will we ever see the aurora? Will our fates help? I don't even know today's fate. I know all about that. [Soo-jin] I hope many miracles find you. Miracles that are surprising, mysterious and beautiful. I'll pray for you. [knocking on door] [man] Yes? Hello, can I ask you something? -[man] How can I help you? -Yes, well... I'm looking for someone, I think she graduated here. [man] Oh. How do you know the graduate? I'm a friend. We can't release private information to a third party. Ah. Couldn't you at least look her up? [man] I'm sorry, that's not our job. What's going on? He's looking for a graduate. Which year and name? Not sure about the year, but her name is Gong So-yeon. -Gong So-yeon, Gong So-yeon... -[keyboard clicking] [woman] Oh, her. How do you know her? Elementary school classmates. [woman] Was she healthy back then? Heal... Yes, somewhat. [woman] A year after the World Cup, so it was 2003. That's when she passed away, she had an illness. [melancholy music playing] Oh... Oh... I see. [So-hee] But I have also lied to you, so I want to be ready. Well, then... [So-hee] Let's meet on December 31 if it rains. Thank you. Thank you. [So-hee] That's the only promise I can make to you. Let's meet when it rains on that day. No more questions, let's do that. Do me this favor. [melancholy music continues] [phone ringing] [So-hee] Hello, this is Magazine Nation. Oh, hello there. Yes, yes. Oh... It should arrive in the new year, maybe around the 5th. Yes. [cell phone chimes] HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YOU'VE RECEIVED 10% OFF COUPON DELETE [sighs] [buoyant music playing] So-hee! Gong So... Gong So-hee! -[squeals, then laughs] -[whoops] [whoops] [So-hee squeals] WHITE DONKEY BOOKS, MUSIC, COFFEE Your mother's running an online book community. A hard-boiled book café. Yeah. She has a lot of followers. They call her "Queen of the Underground." What was the name of the community... -"Losers and Geeks." -Yeah! I'm a member too. Singles are losers and married members are geeks. I'm a loser, then. Right. [sighs] I'll be 30 soon. Goodbye, my 20s. I got a year left. Good for you, kiddo. [tea trickling] Were my sister still alive, we could've had a party here. Mm. So-hee. Remember when I said I'd stop coming to the shop? [So-hee's mother] Promise me something? Like what? [poignant music playing] Could you write something for So-yeon? You've watched her till the end. It could be a line, or two. A good memory. [Bookworm] So-yeon, are you asleep? It's me, Nerd. It's been a while. Should I read to you until So-hee comes? FROM YOUNG-HO P.S. MY NUMBER IS 018... Should I put it on your ear? [bell dings] [Young-ho over phone] Hello? Hello? Is this So-yeon? [teacher] What is sin 12°? [students murmuring] [teacher] Don't use that to enroll in a different class. Don't drink too much! [exhales] [cell phone buzzing] Hello? Hello? Is this So-yeon? I, uh... I... It's been a while. [poignant music continues] [So-hee] It's been a long time, sis. I always wanted to spend my birthday with you, but it's hard when I'm alone. You would've been 30 soon, time flies. I think about it from time to time. What would've happened if you met him? GONG SO-YEON But I didn't have the courage and turned away. [So-hee] I'm sorry. You wanted to see him so dearly. I, uh... Please don't hang up. Let me just say ten phrases. You don't have to say anything. The thing is, when you said we should meet on a rainy day, I resented it at first. I wondered if you hated me. But if you have a reason, that's totally fine, really. But... but... I'll wait for you because I like you. Sir! Wait! Sir! Sir! Sir! Wait! [gasping] This isn't a Seoul address, it's regional. [mailman] All right. -[Young-ho] Regional. -[mailman] Okay. PLEASE KEEP YOUR PROMISE. WHEN IT RAINS, I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

Looking back, my 20s were similar to umbrellas. Always lost, rusty, broken and missing. They all look the same too. I won't ever forget this period in my life. Thank you, truly. There was so much to tell you, but I guess it won't happen. I'll miss you. Goodbye. [horns honking] [sighs] [Young-ho] Whenever I walk here, I have this thought. Maybe the miracle in my life has already passed. Or maybe it never comes to someone like me. Then I have another thought. Maybe a useless guy like me can be a miracle to someone. I think about these unknowable questions. [poignant music playing] [raindrops pitter-pattering] [children clamoring faintly] [Young-ho] This is a story about waiting. A story about petty waiting. GONG SO-YEON A story of hope that brushed us, dreams, and love. And... it's a story... about old and worn-out things... YOU DID SO WELL! ...that left us. GONG SO-YEON [poignant music playing] [panting] [So-hee] When I was young, I thought it rained when the sky was tired. "Let's stay here together for a moment." That childish thought has not changed. [raindrops pitter-pattering] [poignant music playing] [Young-ho] My story ends here. Some said this winter rain was a miracle, and others said it was just a warm winter. [upbeat music playing] Mom, my gym uniform! It's not dry yet, wear your sister's. Use this to wipe your sweat. -[So-yeon] So-hee. -[So-hee] Yeah? Run hard and win first place. I'm so bad at running, will there be a miracle? [So-yeon] I'll pray for that miracle. [So-hee] Okay, I'll run for you too. [Kim Kiwon's "The Story Hidden in My Heart" playing] Translated by: Tae Jo
