[opening theme music] [Alina moaning] [Alina and Shawn moaning] [both moaning] ALINA: Babe. [moaning] -Oh, hey. So I've got a girlfriend. Her name is Jana. [pings] That's not Jana. That's Alina. We'll come back to her in a second. Now before you get all judgy, let me explain a little bit about myself and my lifestyle here in Hong Kong. My name is Shawn Koo. I'm the managing director at Centurion Properties. It's my family's business. Empire really. Yachts, buildings, supercars, fashion, jewelry, women... hell, you name it, we own it. See, we're one of the five elite families that became super wealthy, and remained super wealthy, over half a century with a "build and sell" business model, acquiring, developing, and selling the most coveted commodity in Hong Kong... space. Nearly 30 percent of all real estate in Hong Kong is owned by us. I'm serious. GABE: [voice-over] Now this is Bucky, a brother from a drunken mother and the big boss of Icon, one of the biggest property developers in Thailand. Now his wife, Maria, and his son live in Thailand while Bucky lives here in Hong Kong for business. He goes back to visit them a couple times a year. It's okay. -Hey, Bucky. Yo, comp cards. -[Flavia moaning rapidly] -Are you coming, baby? -[Bucky moaning] -[Shawn and Alina moaning loudly] SHAWN: Oh, I'm coming now! So that's me on a typical Friday night, having a good time... before everything changed. [serene music playing] [airplane engine revs] [over PA] Paging passenger [indistinct]. Please proceed to Gate 32. SHAWN: [voice-over] Now, earlier I mentioned comp cards. Every month, models from all over the world come to Hong Kong to try their luck at various high-end campaigns. -That's me. -Camila, you say? SHAWN: [voice-over] Now, these comp cards are sent to all the agencies, but some of them manage to land in the hands of people like Gabe. Gabe Bourbon is my PR, which stands for Public Relations, with an emphasis on Relations. A former model himself, Gabe is like the grease in the wheels between people like me and well, all the new product that comes into the city. -Oh, my god. So pretty. I love the buildings. -[driver speaking in foreign language] -[speaking in foreign language] -[driver speaking in foreign language] SHAWN: [voice-over] So here's the deal. Zanka, a big development company in China, offered us 1.8 billion Hong Kong dollars for our family building, Phoenix Court. Today's my once-a-month luncheon with my mother. She wants to discuss the deal. Now my mother, Beatrice, and I have a pretty direct business kind of relationship. You'll see. -You're not dating a Russian model, are you? -How the fuck does she knew about Alina? Not really. -We are in our final negotiations with Zanka Properties. Everything is on course, except for one wrinkle. -What's that? -Zanka is a family-run business, as is ours. Their chairman, Mr. Chen Bin, is saying that the optics of our family business is not on par with theirs. -The fuck does that mean? -It means that he knows you're fucking around with a different foreign model every week, and he doesn't want a wild man potentially running his company. We need to deliver a package that looks good to him. -Okay. What does he have in mind? -He needs you to be with someone of similar stature. -The models I date are usually taller than me. -Let me spell it out for you, Shawn. He needs you to pair with a Chinese woman from a prominent family, well-established in the property development business in Hong Kong or in mainland China. And he needs a public announcement of the engagement or he walks away from the deal. -You're fucking with me, right? -Shawn, no matter what happens, we are not walking away from the biggest merger in Hong Kong's history with the largest property development company in China, because if you marry the wrong person, it adversely affects not only your life but our family business, and that is something that neither you nor I can allow to happen. You understand that, don't you? -How could I not? I've heard that many times. -We need an offspring to run the family business that your father and I have built. You understand that, don't you? Mr. Chen will be coming to Hong Kong in three days. He's looking forward to meeting you and your Chinese counterpart. -Now you know why I see my mother once a month for lunch. You know what? Next time I see her, I'm not bringing flowers. I'm bringing my lawyer. See you next month, Mom. -[Beatrice blows kisses] APPLE: Welcome to Hong Kong. CAMILA: Thank you. -[soft music playing] -[car door slides] [knocking on door] [footsteps] [door opens] [luggage wheels rolling] -Yui move out tomorrow. You take her bed. Tonight, you go Club Boomerang. Look for Maaike. Okay? Good luck. SHAWN: [voice-over] Once they realize they'll be sharing a dump with four other models, most of them decide their life is better outside your apartment and inside a nightclub. And what better reason to be in a nightclub than for your birthday? Because here in Hong Kong, if you have enough juice... ...every night is your fucking birthday. [upbeat music playing] -[chuckles] -Hey, baby. -Hi, honey. -How you doing? -Great. -[Shawn clears throat] [car beeping] [phone ringing] -Shawn... we've been together how long now? -About a year? -No. Two years. That's a long time. Honey, don't you think we should take the next step? -[scoffs] Sweetie, do you know what's the longest I've ever been in a relationship? -Oh, stop it. -Three months. -And? -No, I'm serious. I've never been with anyone longer than three months. Do you know how many models I meet every day who are trying to sit in your seat? I mean, it's just nonstop, yet I choose you to be my queen bee, baby. You know the shit I have to deal with at work. You know that. Trying to keep Boomerang going, dealing with my parents, my mother. I mean, okay? I have a lot on my plate. -I also have a lot on my plate, Shawn. -Are you unhappy? -[scoffs] -I mean, if you're unhappy, I'm-- -I'm just saying you're not the only one who has admirers, you know? -[Shawn sighs] -But I chose to be with you because I love you. -Say that again. -[chuckles] I love you. -I know that. -Give me a kiss. [chuckles] [big band music playing] SHAWN: [voice-over] Now we have a game here in Hong Kong, and every game has rules. Rule number one: no photos or videos with your side squeeze ever. Ever. Rule number two: Always match correctly in public. Wife with wife, side squeeze with side squeeze. -What is she doing here? -I didn't know she was here. I'll take care of her. Don't worry, baby. WELLINGTON: Hey, Chai. How you doing, brother man? SHAWN: [voice-over] And that brings us to the most important rule of all, rule number three. Never betray your brother. -Hey, babe. Hey. How you feeling? [lively chattering] We're gonna go hard tonight. Here we go. -Whoo! -[glasses clinking] -All right, everybody. Let's play trivia. -Yes. [laughing and cheering] -All right. Here we go. -All right, question number one. How many foreign models are in Hong Kong? -Five hundred. -Nine hundred. Nine hundred. -Ah, Alina wins. -One thousand. But how many foreign models come in to Hong Kong every month? [overlapping chattering] -One hundred. -Ah, Jana. -Here's another question. What's the number one requested city in Asia for foreign models? -Hong Kong. -Hong Kong! -Hong fucking Kong. -All right, guys. Guys, guys. How many millionaires are there in Hong Kong? -Twenty thousand. -Five. -Any guesses? Come on. -Eighty-five. -Come on! -Three hundred.-Guys, guys. There's one million millionaires in Hong Kong, which means one out of seven people in Hong Kong is a fucking millionaire. How about that?! -The highest concentration of rich motherfuckers like us in the world, surpassing New York, and Paris, and Tokyo. -One of the tiniest cities in the world. -Which means, on any given night of the week, the chances of you meeting a millionaire-- -Billionaire is the highest in the world. -So, guys, why is Hong Kong the number one requested city for foreign models in the world? Drumroll. [drumroll around table, stops] -Because Hong Kong is the easiest city in the world to meet super rich motherfuckers like us! [all cheering] -Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! -Hong fucking Kong! [all cheering] [rap music blasting on speaker] -That's for me. Lady, that's for me. -Welcome to my club. Club Boomerang. Let's get some dim sum. [blasting rap music continues] BUCKY: Come on! [all cheering] -Hey, are you Camila? -Yes. -I'm Maaike. Maaike. Apple? Apple at the agency. -Apple, of course. -Yes. She told me to look out for you. Look, it's really loud here. Do you want to go outside and have a drink? A drink? Outside? -Yes. Yes, yes. -Yes. It's so loud. I can't hear you. -Yeah, that's right. -Okay. Let's go. [rap music blasting on speaker] -You're beautiful. -Thank you. -Where you from? -Brazil. -Brazil? -Yes. -How long have you been in Hong Kong? -Um, just today. -Just one day? -Yes, one day. Uh-- -Ugh. -[Camila giggles] -You know how long I've been here? Thirteen years. -Um... [clicks tongue] I...I'm sorry, my English is not good. I-- -Oh, don't worry about it. Neither was mine when I first got here, so... [distant car honking] Well, welcome to Hong Kong. -Thank you. -The greatest city on the planet. Where you can party non-stop, Monday to Sunday, every week-- -Well, ugh... I need translator. -Yeah. -That okay? -Mm-hm. -Um... okay. [chuckles] -All year round for free. What's not free are the choices you make. Hong Kong is the most expensive city in the world. Where a 300-square-feet shoebox apartment will cost you eight grand U.S. a month. You'll need a VIP to back you up. -VIP? -A very... interested person. In this town, every model has one. You're here to play a game. Models versus VIPs. They're using us. We're using them. The object of the game is to get whatever you can out of them, whichever way you can. There's no victims in this game. We're all equal players. Look, I came here to model. I don't have to do that anymore. My VIP, Julian, he takes care of everything. You know what I like about this town? It's transactional. You get what you give. Another question for you is, what are you willing to give? [rap music blasting on speaker] ALL: Chug! [lively chattering] Shawn Koo! SHAWN: [voice-over] Three words. Hong fucking Kong. [melancholy music playing] [models giggling] SHAWN: Look, I gave you shares of Phoenix Court to fuck you, but now I need them back. I'll give you something else, okay? ALINA: Yeah? Try 130 million. SHAWN: A hundred thirty million? [cash register pings] Are you out of your fucking mind? That's almost-- that's almost 45 percent above market price. -You want your 5 percent shares of Phoenix Court back, that's what it's gonna take. Nothing less. A gift is a gift, Shawnie. -Gift my ass. You fucking extorted me. -Extort? Extort? I didn't force you to do anything. -You knew my family needed 80 percent shares to sell the building. That's why you wanted part of my shares, right? So we couldn't sell it without you. -I didn't force you. -You roped me into fucking you, then used that against me. That's extortion. -You got what you paid for, didn't you? -'ll offer you 90 million. That's fair-- -[Alina laughs mockingly] -That's fair market price. You'll get the money after the sale goes through. I don't have that kind of cash at the moment. -Hundred and thirty million. Or no deal. -Fuck. [phone vibrating] -Oh, shit. Shit. -Hey, it's just a game, Shawn. Don't be such a sore loser. -Maria. Why are we having this conversation again? I told you I'm busy in Hong Kong. -Okay. BUCKY: You know I hate waking up with you not by my side. -I know everyone you work for in Hong Kong, all right? I make one call and you're done. BUCKY: Listen to me, okay? Um, I-- -I make one call, and you're done. -[scoffs] What's that supposed to mean? -You'll find out. [music playing] -Baby, listen to me, okay? Um, I will try to come back as soon as possible. I'll let you know. Okay? Smile for Bucky. S-- -[phone clicks, beeps] Fuck, I'm sober now. Fuck me. What a fucking night. Happy birthday, bro. -Yeah. Thanks, bro. -[chugs alcohol] Agh. [soft music playing] -Hey... [sighs] GABE: [voice-over] Hey Camila, it's Gabe Bourbon. I have a job offer for you. Call me back. [car honking] -Hello. - Ni hao . [speaks in Cantonese] -Uh, I--I'm sorry...I-- -[speaks Cantonese] -[stammers] I forget. I have card. -[speaks Cantonese] -I--I--I will find my card. I mean, please, please, please. Okay. Okay. -[speaks Cantonese] [speaking in Cantonese] -[speaks Cantonese] -I have-- -You. -From the party last night. Hi. -Hi. -I'm Shawn. -Camila. -You're not eating that, are you? That's at least a week old. -I--I-- -Let me buy some lunch. I'll get you some proper food. Yeah? -Now? -Yeah, now. -You're not busy? -Not anymore. -[speaking in Cantonese] -Okay. Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry. -[speaking in Cantonese] -You had a good birthday. -It wasn't my birthday. -[chuckles] Why they sing "Happy Birthday" to you? -I have them do it. Every week. And Boomerang is my club. I plan on opening another one in Shanghai. -Sorry, my English is not good. -All right. We'll... -Here. -...we'll use Google Translate. -Yes. -Yeah? Okay. -Is good for me. [chuckles] -All right, first question. Um, first time to Hong Kong? -[speaking in Portuguese] -Mm-hm. How long have you been modeling? -[speaking in Portuguese] -Oh, São Paulo. -Yeah. -I love Brazil. I have many Brazilian friends. I go to Brazil for work all the time. -Yeah. Whoo! [ladies giggling] -[woman speaks in Portuguese] -All the time? -Yeah. -Um... [speaking in Portuguese] -Oh, I know. That 20-hour flight feels like two hours to me. -Mm. -Boom. -No. -I'm there. -[Camila laughs] -I love the warmth and passion of Brazilians. [all wooing] -I love Brazil! -Just like you. -Like me? -Mm-hm. -Okay. [giggles] -I'd like to get to know you better. Is that okay? -Do you speak Portuguese? -One line. -Teach me a line in Portuguese. -[in Portuguese] Cala a boca tira a roupa e me beija. -What does it mean? -It means, "I love you." -Ooh. Cala a boca oh mo goca e mi mi sha. Yeah? How was it? -[sighs] Fucking terrible. -Hey, babies. Cala a boca oh mo goca e mi mi sha. Oh. -One line. What is it? -Not gonna tell you. -Why? -'Cause I suck at Portuguese. [laughs] I've tried. I'm serious. I can't say it. Really bad. -[Camila chuckles] -No language skills. Yeah. -Okay. -So. -Okay. Okay. Okay. -Another time. -Another time. Okay. [chuckles] -Hey. So... Camila? -Mm-hm. -Would you like to see Hong Kong? [laughs] -No. Okay. [laughs] Okay, let's go. -Yeah? -Yep. -Now? -[Camila giggling] -A little different from Brazil, huh? -Yeah, a little different. -Look at that. All these buildings, eh? -[saleswoman and Camila speaking in Portuguese] -[indistinct] buildings. -Oh. Voila. Thanks. Oh, that's great. Okay. -You like? -Oh, my God. So [speaks Portuguese]. It is flores. -Flores? -Flores, yeah. -Flowers? -Flowers. Yes. Yes. Like my home. -Oh. Okay, I tell you what, I'll get you something even nicer. I'll show you where I shop. Yeah? -Okay. -Okay? -Okay. -Okay. -[Shawn and saleswoman speak in Cantonese] -Thank you. [shrieks, giggling] -I know Hong Kong inside and out. I'll show you around. I'll make sure you're safe. -Okay. -Hey, look at this. We're on Canton Road now.-Okay. -Canton Road is like the Rodeo Drive. You know Rodeo in Beverly Hills? -I'm gonna take you to this special store right now. Their clothes fit you perfect. -Yes? -Perfect. Young, hip, colorful, cute. -For me? -For you. Just for you. -[laughs] Okay. -You don't believe me? -I believe. [laughs] -[laughs] Special store. -Special store. -Just for you. -Okay. -I told them a VIP is coming. -Thank you. Okay. Thank you. -All right, here we go. -Here? -Yeah. Let's go. -Wow! Wait, this place is closing, right? -Not for us. Come. [footsteps] -Hey, Diana. -Good evening, sir. -Thanks for closing the store for us. -Our pleasure. -Yeah. So, I've got a really special friend today. I want you to bring out the latest stuff. -Mm. -Okay? -Of course. No problem. -Yeah? All right, I'll be right back. -Ooh. ["Wrap Me Up" by Albert Chiang and Emily Morioka Meyer playing] -Yeah, try it. Try everything. Oh, that's beautiful. Looks great on you. -Try? -Try it. Yeah.

How will you...? -Give me your hand. Okay. Ta-da. It matches perfectly with your-- -Thank you. -You like? -Yes, I like it so much. -Listen, I'm going to the Maldives this weekend. I'd like you to come with me. We'll leave Friday. We'll come back Monday. I'll...I'll take care of everything. Just bring your passport. Yeah? -Sorry, I cannot. -What? Come on. It's the Maldives. -[scoffs] [phone beeps] -[speaking in Portuguese] -Okay. I thought you wanted to get to know each other better. -I--I have to go. Okay. -Well-- well, how about a yacht trip this Sunday? I've never not closed a model with the Maldives. [soft instrumental music playing] [phone beeps] -Semi, let's go. And call my lawyer. My mother wants me to meet Zanka Properties chairman Mister Chen. Apparently now we have 48 hours to respond or they'll walk, and Alina still legally has my shares of the building. -Wonderful wife. SHAWN: [voice-over] Now my mother asked Yvonne Tsai, a major socialite, to join. Word around town is that she's got so much work done on her face, her nickname's "Botox Tsai." -Hi. What's the problem? -There's no problem. -You don't look happy. Did I--did I offend you? -That's just the way I look. -A little... strong look. Yeah. -BEATRICE: Ah. -SHAWN: Hi. -Let me introduce you to my son, Shawn. Mister Chen. - Ni hao. -[speaking Mandarin] -Hey, darling. -Fuck me. [knocks on door] Yeah. [door opens] Hey. -Oh. -Hundred million cash. Take it or leave it. -Hundred and twenty million cash. Take it or leave it. -Oh, come on, baby. You already made my balls blue. Don't crush it. Do it, and I'll make you my queen bee. -Queen bee? -Yeah. -Really? -Promise. -Oh, wow. Queen bee. Mm. -[moans] -I don't crush balls, baby. -[thuds against wall] -[Shawn groans] -I only caress them. -Oh. -This is your favorite, isn't it, baby? -I love you so much, baby. -Tell me, baby. Why do you want this so badly? Hm? Hm? A hundred and ten million. Final offer. -In that case, it's still 130 million. Now get the fuck out! Beast! [slams door] ANDY: Okay, so your parents have signed, and how are we with Alina? -Man, anything is possible. -What does that mean? -Let me ask you this. How bad do you want this, bro? -Let me put it this way. If I don't get those shares back, my mom's not only going to cut me off, she's going to sue my ass. -Shut your shit. Really? -She sued her own brother, Uncle Lehmann, over a land deal. He went to jail for two years. She even threatened to cut me off unless I marry Botox Tsai. Listen, guys. I need your help. -You okay with her cheating on you? [rap music blasting on speaker] [camera shutter clicking] -Is she cheating on me? SHAWN: Yeah. JANA: It's very tight. SHAWN: Yeah. Ow. Ow. Ow. JANA: Yeah? That's it? SHAWN: Yeah, harder. Harder. [laughing] -What are you laughing at? -[laughing, sobbing] -Shawn? Hey, honey. Look at me. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, my god. What's the matter? Did I press too hard? -No. [muttering] I'm just so stressed. I don't know what to do. -You're stressed about what? -Work stuff. -Property related, yeah? -Yeah, totally. -Oh, my god. -[cries] -Hey, baby. Hey. -Now what? -I love you so much. Will you marry me? -[sobbing] -Yes? Is that a yes? I need to hear you say it, Shawn! Hey! -Yes! -[excited chuckle] My god. [moaning] [elevator beeps] STAFF: Welcome to Sassy Lane Jewelry Casting. -Hello. -Hello. -Please sign up the form. -Okay. [soft music playing] -You're late. [elevator pings] -Camila. This is for you. -Just dinner, right? -You're gonna meet Wellington. He's one of my biggest VIPs. One of the richest men in Hong Kong. -Okay. -You take care of him, he's gonna take care of you. Okay? -Take... take care? -[singing in foreign language] -Ah, Wellington. Please, meet Camila from Brazil. -Camila. Please. -[indistinct]. -Ah. [wine pouring] -How many days you are in Hong Kong? -Just two days. [both laugh] -How do you like Hong Kong so far? -Expensive. -Ah, yes. -[Camila chuckles] -I know. Hong Kong is the most expensive city in the world. -Okay. -Camila, I want to help. Let me tell you a story. You see that pretty girl over there? -Yes. -Her name is Anu. She is also a model, from Estonia. She came to Hong Kong one year ago, but she cannot make ends meet. -Um, sorry. Google Translate, um, yes. -Okay. -Okay. [chuckles] -Every month, she has no money, like you. [laughs] So I introduce her to my friend, Dr. Arjun Daruwala. The doctor has a wife, but the wife understands. So now they are together. Look how happy they are. Excuse me. [clears throat] -Hey, Camila. Listen to me. Wellington wants to set you up at the Four Seasons with a monthly allowance of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars. In return, all he wants is to see you once or twice a week, mainly to join him on social gatherings like this. You'd never have to work another day in your life. You are set. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? -Yes. I'm not interested. -Camila, listen. He's 100 percent aboveboard. Him and his wife, they have an agreement. -[clears throat] This, they give to you. -[sighs] Two days here, you, second person tried buy me. -Enjoy your cake. -I understand. You cannot accept the old Hong Kong traditional way. But we can be friend. I can do it the Brazilian way. You can help me. So, how do you say "okay" in Brazil? -Okay? -Just okay? -Yes. -Oh, okay. Where would you like to go in Hong Kong? -Mass. -Mass? -Yes. Catholic mass. [rosary jingles] -Me, Catholic. Very good Catholic. -You-- [chuckles] you are Catholic? -Yeah. Can I take you to my church? -You have a church? Look, one wants to take me to the Maldives and the other wants to take me to church. -[chuckles] I don't know-- I don't know anyone who's ever said no to a trip to the Maldives with Shawn Koo. -Seriously? -Yeah. He's one of the biggest VIPs here. -Oh... -Yeah. -Okay. Okay. [sighs] I need to say in Portuguese. -Yeah. -[speaking in Portuguese] [phone beeps] -Oh, you-- you know what I mean? You understand? -Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yes. I know what you mean. I know what you mean. Yes. -Right? -Yeah. When I first got here, I felt exactly the same way. But as I, you know, got to know these VIPs, I realized that they're all like that. A-are you cold? -Yes. -You wanna put this on? -Yes, yes. -Yes! It's here for that reason. -Oh, my god. Thank you. So cold here. -I know. I know it's cold, but look how pretty it is. -Yes, pretty, of course. -You had to see it. [both chuckle] -But as I got to know these VIPs, I realized they're all like that. That's all they know. That's how they were taught. And also, just because someone gives you a gift, it doesn't mean you have to sleep with him. You know? -How about you? -How about me? -Yes. -[soft chuckle] What about me? -[giggles] -Let's just say that I have received a lot of gifts in my time here. And let's just say that many of them have become good friends of mine. -Okay... I don't know. -Well, maybe Shawn can also become a good friend of yours. Or maybe... you can change him. [upbeat music playing] -[sighs] So what the fuck are you gonna do about Jana? -I don't want to marry her. I also don't want her to marry anyone else. Is that fucked up? -Look, I can sugarcoat this 69 times and it's still fucked up. But how is she doing anyway? -Oh, she's been out of the modeling scene for a while. Her mom's not doing well and, you know, she's got medical bills to take care of. -Why don't I go check up on her and see if I could, you know, lift her spirits or, I don't know, tell her how much you love her. -Yeah, see if she's okay. -Okay. [upbeat music playing continues] [motorboat engine revving] [models cheering] [yacht honking] [lively chattering] -Whoo! -[water splashes] Let's get in the water. -Hey. [laughs] [lively chattering] Shawn... SHAWN: This is the third time we've met. Ready for the Maldives? -[speaking in Portuguese] -[scoffs] The Maldives is one of the top ten resorts in the world. There's no finer place to get to know each other better. Come on. -[speaking in Portuguese] Come on. Look. -[Shawn scoffs] -[Camila chuckling] -I don't think I've ever met anyone quite like you. Oh, I get it. You have offers from other men. I'll double whatever they're offering you. -[speaking in Portuguese] -Okay... what do you want to talk about? -[speaking in Portuguese] -Me? -Yes. -Um... All right. Um...I'm Shawn. -Okay. -[laughs] Why don't you lead the way. -Uh... [speaking in Portuguese] Money is not part of this in my life. Do you know what I mean? You? -Um...I'm from Hong Kong. A city of 7.5 million people. My parents, um, they co-own one of the biggest property development companies in Asia. They've been married for 40 years but they lead separate lives. I'm a managing director in their company but really it's just a facade because, you know, they control everything. I'm a single child. I see my parents separately once a month. I look at my parents, and money is the only thing that keeps them together. So, money is a part of my family my entire life. -[speaking in Portuguese] It's...it's the only thing I know. -Mm. -[soft chuckle] -[in Portuguese] Se você quer me comprar, me compre com amor. -"If you want to buy me, buy me with love." -Yes. -How? -How? [laughs] [romantic music playing] -[speaking in Portuguese] Comece pelo seu coração. -[reading] "Start with your heart." Mm. Mm. [romantic music continues] -Hey. -Hm? Hey. -I said I can't marry you. I'm sorry. -What? You disappear for a few days, and you come back and tell me this? -I know. When I was on my yacht, I felt a cold chill come over me right down to my spine. It-- it felt like I just killed somebody, and nobody knows about it... -[overlaps] What? -...but somebody's gonna find out. -What are you talking about? Kill who? You want to kill me?! -No, no. What I meant was, it felt like I had just killed somebody, and it scared me. It scared me so much I--I-- it made me feel ill. In fact, I--I still feel ill right now. Like I want to vomit. -Stop. [laughs] You are telling me that the thought of marrying me makes you feel like you just killed someone? Makes you feel like you want to vomit? -Yeah. -Okay. Ah. Oh, my god. [breathes heavily] -Are you okay? -No, no, no. [chuckles] I don't feel so good. -Uh, Jana, I-- I don't know how to say this, but I--I don't think I was ever in love with you.

Make yourself at home. I'm not asking. [distant dog barking] My name is Vadim Petrenkov. Name rings a bell? -What do you want? -Do you have an idea about her? She's my sister. -We're just friends. -Friends? -Yeah. Just friends. -Seems a bit more than friends to me. -Close friends. -You give her 5 percent of Phoenix Court. -That's conditional upon us being in a relationship, which clearly we're not. -My friend, you stole Alina's shares from her. So now you should give her back what you owe. One hundred and thirty million dollars. -This is just a game, my friend. Don't be a sore loser. -[punch thrown] -[Shawn grunts] [smashing head] -[Shawn grunts] -[Vadim exhales] -Oh. -This is how you get your nose broken. Alina has already put down a deposit, nonrefundable, on an apartment in Moscow, relying on her shares. You cannot just take back what you give. This is our family business. This is not a game. -That's not my fucking problem. [smashing head] -Yes, it is, my friend. Yes, it is. I'm sure we can figure something out. So, I will need 130 million dollars in 36 hours. That is Monday, 12:00 noon. And every day that I do not see my money, I will hurt one of them. One by one. Do you understand?

[groans] And do you know I'm dating her too? -Hong Kong has a thousand foreign models. You had to pick her? -I was gonna ask you the same question, actually. -This isn't funny, Dad. She meant something to me. She... she could be your granddaughter. What the hell are you doing? -[laughs] Shawn, you don't have the right to own anybody in Hong Kong. It's unfortunate this time that both of our object of conquest happened to be the same person. -Mom, did you know about this? -And all the hundreds during the course of our 40-year marriage. -[Wellington laughs] -We have an arrangement. It works, as long as whatever he does brings no harm to our family business. That is the important thing. What is dangerous is if I don't know, and that becomes something potentially that neither one of us can control. -[Wellington sighs] This time, your association, your affair, or your deal, or whatever with this Russian girl resulted in our family losing control over Phoenix Court on 1.8-billion-dollar deal. If that is not bad enough, we know about Vadim. -You know about Vadim? And you didn't do anything? The guy almost killed me. -We wanted to teach you a lesson. -[laughs] -Whatever your father does on the outside, he never brings it back into the family. But what you are doing, sleeping with foreign girls with mafia ties... that is like playing with powder kegs every day. -Okay. This isn't about the family business. -[Wellington clears throat] -If it were, you would have stepped in the second you knew about Alina's 5 percent. Yeah. This is about me. You can't accept the fact that I fuck around with foreign models, and that's because you can't accept the fact that Dad fucks around with foreign models himself. You're just using the family business to control me. Hm? The only thing in your life you can't control. -I assure you... you are not the only thing in my life that I can control. Case in point: I have submitted a proposal to Centurion's board to remove you as our successor, and as beneficiary to our company's trust account. The board will meet tomorrow at noon to discuss my proposal. They tend to do as I ask of them. -[gasps] -I suggest after the board meeting, you start looking for a real job for once in your life. -All because I won't marry Botox Tsai? -All because you refuse to give up Miss Brazil. -You're forcing me to choose? -Rather, you are forcing me. Tomorrow noon, Shawn. I'm late for an appointment. By the way, that thing on your nose looks ridiculous. [footsteps receding] - For your information, nothing happened between me and Camila. -Wait... you didn't sleep with her? -[laughs] I-- I went to church with her. -She turned down your Four Seasons offer? -She turned down your Maldives trip? -[Shawn sighs] -Shawn... how does she make you feel?
