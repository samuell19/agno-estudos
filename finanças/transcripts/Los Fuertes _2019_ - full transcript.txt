THE STRONG ONES Thanks. - Have a good day. - Thanks doctor. Bye. - How was the trip? - Good. I'm just a bit tired. Doctor, Mrs. Gladys Henríquez. Mrs. Gladys. - How are you? - Good, thanks. Please come in. - Should I wait for you then? - Two patients left. Hello... - It's almost ready... - Don't worry! My brother, Lucas. Hello. - How are you? - Good. You can leave your stuff upstairs. And Martín? He's at the factory. He'll be here later. Excuse me. Mrs. Adriana, Do you think Antonio could help me with the firewood? Of course. Great, thank you. Wanna go out? It's good! I haven't had this for a while. Mrs. Adriana made them. My phone? Wasn't it in your bag? And my bag? When is your flight? From Santiago? Right? The 23rd. Dad. Hi. We are good. Dad... We're eating now. Where are you going to stay when you get there? What? Where are you going to stay when you arrive? I'm staying with a friend. Well, I don't know. I'll tell him. They said hi. - Hey. - Hi. I don't know-- My grandma said no one was here. Doesn't matter. Want some help? Sure. Thank you. Sure. See you. Bye. Toqui! Good luck. See you. Morning captain. - How are we doing? - Well. Cold today. - How's Nancy? - Better. See you in there. Pull it up! Charly! Get to the boat! Watch out! It was a long time ago. I had to sell my car. It wouldn't even start. You could get the down payment with your truck. Sell that shit before it explodes! I've been saving. All these guys are coming to work with me. They all agreed. If you're as good as your father we're all screwed. You look more like him everyday. Toño! Nothing over here! - C'mon... - We talked about it! Did you forget? - I can't see... - Sorry. Open up. Where are you going then? The doctor told me everything about you. - To Montreal. - Open. Sounds great... He is doing a graduate course in architecture... You're going to have to build me a house here then. - It's about patrimony. - Open. Right, in patrimony. Did I tell you that he was the first person whose wisdom teeth I took out? - Really? - Yeah! He went to the university clinic. I was a fifth year... He had them already, and I was supposed to do it at some point... So he asked me, and I said yes. They were moving the teeth forward anyway... and he'd had orthodontics before. Lucy, pass the brush. Rinse out. What are you doing about your apartment? I got rid of it. Sold the furniture. Did you leave anything with the folks? No. OK. You're drinking too much coffee.... I can see it in the enamel. On that day, February 3rd, 1820, the Chilean troops led by Lord Thomas Cochrane, began their mission when the first sixty brave men disembarked. The Spanish defenders in Corral saw them advancing. The sleeping cannons and muskets broke their silence. This castle would then see its first combat, which would also be its last. In the early hours of the morning, in a truly suicidal act, the men fighting for Chilean independence entered through the rear of the castle. Aim! Fire! The most important fortress south of the bay had fallen. Hi. Can I get one? Grab a beer? No... I'm beat. Alright. See you. - Take care. - Say hi to the girls. Hungry? Hi! I didn't know they did this. It is good? Very. Can I get one please? Thanks. You were at sea, right? Yeah. For a couple of days. What do you fish? Sardines. We sell them to this fishery in town. What have you been up to? Not much. I went to Niebla. I'm doing these drawings of the forts. And I came to see my sister too. When was the last time you saw her? A while ago. She comes to Santiago sometimes, but I haven't been here for a couple of years. Are you sure? Yeah. It's on my way. - It's getting foggy... - Yeah. See that island? - Which one? - There. That's where I grew up. Really? Do you live there? Not anymore. I live here now. Up there, On the hill. Thanks. Aren't you supposed to eat with them? - Yeah... - Get out of here then! Bye. I wanted to work in conservation, not in a wood chipping factory! Hi. We waited for you. I got stuck. Take off your shoes, you'll leave mud all over the floor. Martín, stop it, alright? Why did we move here then? I will not have a child like this. Lucas! What did you plug in? Nothing! Don't plug the heater in! - Can you go out and check? - Hey. Do you want to be with me or not? Go take a look... Where's the fuse box? Son of a bitch! Here. Small one too? Yeah! Look. These look good. Haven't found many. It's getting cold, uh? Let's do one more round and then we'll go... Hey... They've been calling me everyday. You should be more patient with them. Until when? I have nothing to say to them. How long has it been like this? It'll take more time for them to get used to... I don't know. I'm leaving now anyway. It's better for everyone. Give it more slack! More! - Let's do the math later. - Thanks. - Finish up, I'll be right back. - OK. C'mon Toño! Hold on! It's coming! How did it go? Not so good. What's the tonnage price this week? Same price since the 10th. That's bad. I don't think it'll change. How much of your quota do you have left to get? Not much. How is it going? Sit down. - You missed the first half! - Couldn't make it... - Want a beer? - Sure. This guy. Get out! Cheers! - You want a ride? - No, I drove. Cata told me to get some stuff for breakfast, can you wait here? Sure. - Where did you come from? - Right here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And another! Remember that all proceeds go to our beloved Fire Station. O sixty-two. Oscar sixty-two. Here comes the ball... B five. Bueno five. - Remember we are doing the T-- - Bingo!

See you. Hello. Hello. - Do you want anything? - What? - Do you want anything? - A glass of mulled wine! And you? You want anything? Sure, some mulled wine too. Cata! - Hello! - How are you?

Great! - Disk brakes! - Yeah! Looks great. We're gonna go... OK... - Can you give me a ride later? - Sure... yeah... See you later. - Mrs. Adriana, should we take you home? - You're leaving? - Yes, we can take you. - Great, let's go. - Thanks a lot. - Sure. Bye. What a great prize! Thanks grandma. Cheers. - Come on winner, let's dance... - I have this problem with my knee. But I'm a kinesitherapist! Just kidding. Come on... Alright... Excuse me. - Leave me after. - Alright. Man, you're lucky. Just tonight. Paolita got you some more crab empanadas. We're going to look like crabs when we go home! My grandchild, a little girl. Cheers to your little girl kiddo. You have a nice place. Thanks. You want something? Beer? Water? No. A cup of tea maybe? Tea? Sure. Should I take my shoes off? If you don't mind. Wait... I'll go turn it off. OK. What's up? What are you doing? Getting dressed. You wanna go? Stay. Don't be a moron. - Take these off... - No... I don't like sleeping like this. Shut up... Here. I thought they had torn it down. Did they sell it? My grandma sold it a long time ago. This one was supposed to be the most strategic. The Spanish could see the whole bay from here. Do they have the reenactments here too? No, they don't. Less people come here. Look! Lucas! What? They're supposed to be all gone. You're smoking now? Where have you been? We went to Antonio's. You should've told me at least. And Martín? He went to the factory. Does he always work on Sundays? Not always. You had a thing with the doctor. You should quit smoking. Don't you know it stains your enamel? Looks like I'm not the only sinner in the family anymore. Definitely calling the folks back now. That's nine eighty. There. - Thanks. - Bye, thanks. Slower... What's that? I got my appendix removed. I was like... Eight or nine. What happened? They put the mask on. And then I woke up, in a recovery room. Right next to me, there was this boy... Who was looking at me. What did he look like? Like me, but blond. We looked at each other for a while... And then he waved his hand. I stoop up somehow, and I got closer to say hi. He had... He had all these bandages, and I thought they had cut off his foot, or something. He told me he'd been run over by a bus. We were together for a while. I remember I took his hand. I remember his eyes... We were there, and... My mom and dad arrived. My dad pulled my hand away. And he said you don't do those things. And we left. Hey. Hi. You look good in my sweatshirt. Sugar? Sure. How many? Four. Four! I didn't know you liked this. - Canada? - Yeah. That's far... I got this scholarship. What do they have there that makes you wanna leave so badly? I wanted to get out... I've never been that far away. Is it near the ocean? No. They have a river though. In Montreal. We have a lot of rivers. You had better stay here. Shit! I give you my sword, and this fortress. In this moment, my troops surrender, along with myself. Soldiers of our motherland, today is a day you will never forget. You have conquered one of the main settlements south of this bay. Careful! I'll go get the other broom. Hey... What's with the guy from Santiago? So that's it? Shut up. Remember where you are. You're getting out. I'll get you out of this shit. You won't get any work, motherfucker. C'mon! - Is it ready? - Ask that motherfucker. - Do you want me to take the swing off? - No. It makes me remember. What happened to you? - When is he leaving? - Right after the carnival. Well... You've got to keep going. Spinning is not allowed. C'mon, we're just playing. That's 9 to 6. 10 to 6! C'mon... This is uneven. Yeah. - It's good. - Let's swap sides. Let's grab a beer. What are you going to do? I want to build myself a boat. To work with Sierra. Two tons. I've been saving. I need some more. Where will you work? Here. Where else? You want to stay here then. What? You think I should leave? I don't know. I wondered. Something new. You think my life is shit? You think what you do is much better than what I do, that I should be somewhere else to be happy. - I don't know, I-- - Go to hell! Hey! I just want you to do well. I will! My grandma is here. My friends are here. My dad... My dad died here. In the bay. I would be afraid. You won't make it anywhere like that. Faster! C'mon! Are we going on Saturday? I don't know yet. Looks like we don't have much quota left to get. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm going to the bathroom. - OK. See you on Saturday. Hey! You're going then? Well... You know that... Roca is having a baby girl. You know how things got better with me. After I started as boatswain. We raised production this year thanks to me. Don't make this harder. It's your loss. Go fuck yourselves. I won't be crushed. Asshole! - Where is he going? - I'll go. Antonio. Antonio! Antonio! What are you doing here? Go! What's going on? What do you care... about what happens to me? You're leaving anyway. Go, and stop messing around. Hey! Some posh kid, who gets everything handed to him. You come up with bullshit just to leave. - 'Cause mommy and daddy won't talk to you? - Don't get into that! Pretty boy is pushing me? You have no right to speak to me like you know everything. If I go it's because I earned that opportunity. Not because I have all the money in the world. And it's not easy either. Even less now. What is it? Has anyone ever told you snore like a rhino? You snore too right? Sometimes. How are you doing? You fucked up yesterday. Hello. Hi. I've been there for years. I won't be disrespected. What are you gonna do now? I'll take you up on that loan. Nico! Hey! - Good morning. - Morning. Come in! Nice to meet you. - Antonio. - Nico. - How are you? - Fine. This is old Galindo's son. I've been told you want a boat. - That's me. - Come in. Look at this one... What is it made of? Lleuque. How long would it take? Two months. When are you done with this one? In about... - In about six weeks. - Alright. We can built it with a cabin... - It's more protected. - Of course. - The price includes the work and the materials? - All of it. What about payment? - Fifty percent at the beginning. - OK. And the other fifty at the end. But it needs to be floating first! It would be better to check whether if floats! Do you have any other ones we can look at? Sure. Let's go in. Soldiers! Stop! Don't move! What should we do about the prisoners? Shoot them! Ready. Aim. Long live Spain! Fire! Order complete! Back to your positions soldiers! Patriots! From now on, is a flag is raised here In this mast it will be the Chilean one. Long live our Independence! Long live! On February 4th, 1820, our national flag was raised here for the first time. We thank you for coming to our historic reenactment, and we wish you a pleasant journey home. Good afternoon. Want some lettuce? Sure. Did you book your appointment? No... - You just need to talk to Lucy. - OK. Pass the wine? It's good. Poor you. He won't have anyone to cook for him. You'll have to learn now! You don't know how to cook? Barely. What can you cook? Well... Hard boiled eggs. Toast and butter. Avocado toast. Among other things. Have you ever been on one of the floats? This one time, when I was little. I was one of the seven dwarfs. It was all the kids from the union. Which one were you? I was Grumpy. Really! We want to give a warm welcome to the tourists on the river, and also to all the visitors we have tonight. Friends from the north, from the south, from outside of Chile, we welcome all of you, and we introduce you to Valdivia, a beautiful city. What time is your flight on Wednesday? Ten. But it's on Friday. Are you sure you want to take him? Yeah. Thank you. Have a good trip. Thank you. I love you. Me too. I hope we can visit. Hope so. It'd be nice. Alright. See you. Take care.
