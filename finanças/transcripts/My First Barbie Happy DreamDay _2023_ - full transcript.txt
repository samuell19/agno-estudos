Hi, Chelsea. Hello, Dreamhouse. Hello, Barbie. Two hot chocolates, please. You got it, Barbie! Whoa, cool! Yum! I didn't know it could do that! With the new Smarthome app, the Dreamhouse can do just about anything. Anything? Hello, Dreamhouse? Yes, Chelsea? Can you help me plan an awesome party tomorrow? Why, of course. I'd be happy to help. Wait! I... um... I mean... party? Why do we need a party? Is there something happening tomorrow? It's my birthday! It's my birthday, it's my birthday, it's my birthday, yeah! Really? Are you sure? I could have sworn that was next week. Nuh-uh. Hello, Dreamhouse. When is my birthday? My calendar shows that tomorrow is, in fact, your birthday. It's my birthday, it's my birthday, it's my birthday, yeah! It's my birth... Wait. You're up to something, aren't you? I... have no idea what you're talking about. I am not planning... I mean, why would I be... Oh, thank goodness. Hello, Dreamhouse. Show me who's at the door, please. Barbie, Teresa, Renee! Oh! Quick, let's hide! Why are we hiding, exactly? You'll see. I've got an idea. Hmm. That's weird. Uh, Barbie did tell us to meet her here, right? Huh. It's on my calendar. Huh. Slumber... party? Wow. Love it! - Cool! - Ooh! A kaleidoscope of butterflies! That's what you call a group of butterflies, a kaleidoscope. Ah! Beautiful. How is this possible? Hello! Aah! Your... your face... If only you could see yourself. You were like... Whoa! You got me good there, for sure. Ho-ho, we're gonna get you for that! - Come here! - Look out! - Thanks for coming. - Of course! So... those butterflies? Where did they go? And where did they come from? It's all part of the magic of the new Dreamhouse. I'm gonna get ya! Hello, Dreamhouse! Activate chessboard. Come here! Does Chelsea have any idea... That you three are really here to help me plan the most epic surprise birthday party ever tomorrow? She has no clue what we're really up to. She thinks you're here for a perfectly normal sleepover. So... what do you have planned so far? I know she wants a carrot cake with pink and white frosting, and I've picked out decorations, but there's something missing. I just can't put my finger on it. We can figure it out together. Stop her! Whaa... When did... she get... so fast? Hello, Dreamhouse. Activate slide. Oh! And ball pit. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Aah! Whoa! Whee! All right, this new Smarthome app is pretty cool. "Pretty cool"? Hello, Dreamhouse... Up, please. What?! Whoo! Time for bed. Doh moh go behbuh. Moh moh noh! Chelsea, finish brushing your teeth first. In the bathroom. Nnh ghh buhroo! I don't want to go to bed yet. I'm having too much fun. See? You're exhausted. Besides, the sooner you get to sleep, the sooner it's your birthday! All right. I guess I'm pretty tired. Can we at least do a story first? That's a great idea. What kind of story do you want to hear? Hmm. I'm not sure. Why don't we make one up? Together. I love that. Genius! Yay! Okay, Chels, why don't you start? Okay. Hmm. Once upon a time, there were two mermaids. Why don't we have the Dreamhouse bring the story to life? Hello, Dreamhouse? Way ahead of you, Barbie. - Whoa! - And they each had a pet... Sea turtle! No, octopi! Technically, the plural of "octopus" is "octopuses". Really? That sounds funny. I know, right? Okay. Pet octopuses. That's still not right. - How about dolphins? - Yeah! They loved playing in the waves together. And exploring the beautiful coral reefs and discovering new undersea flora and fauna. Ooh! And they loved... dance parties! Yeah! Ballet dance parties. I love... I mean, the mermaids love ballet because it's so graceful and it takes so much practice to get right. One day, they were so busy dancing that they didn't see the Sea Dragon was right behind them! The Sea Dragon! Who wore a pearl necklace. She said sorry for scaring the mermaids. She was just lonely, and she invited the mermaids over for a tea party. The mermaids sipped underwater tea with the Sea Dragon... and they all became the best of friends. The end. Best... story... ever. So imaginative. So fun. Magical. Thank you! Mm! Mm... Time for bed. Okay. Good night, Chelsea. Good night, everyone. She's asleep. Finally. So, how can we help with the surprise party tomorrow? I want to throw Chelsea the biggest and best birthday ever. A birthday so special that... that we can't even call it a birthday. What should we call it, then? A Dreamday. We should call it a Dreamday! I like it. So, what have you figured out so far? I've made a list of everything we need to do, but... there's still something missing. Something to bring it all together. We need a theme! All good birthdays, or Dreamdays, have a theme, right? That's it! Let's brainstorm party themes. Do you have any ideas? Excuse me, Barbie. I have a reminder set. Time for bed. Oh, right. You heard her story. She loves ballet dance parties. How about a ballet-themed party? Hello, Dreamhouse. Hello, Barbie. ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ Let's brush our teeth ♪ ♪ Put on your PJs ♪ ♪ A bedtime routine ♪ ♪ Wash your face ♪ ♪ Get squeaky clean ♪ ♪ You know it's time for bed It's time for sweet dreams ♪ ♪ Turn your night light on Let it shine ♪ ♪ All our dreams Are coming to life ♪ ♪ We gotta jump into bed ♪ ♪ Come and sing with me ♪ ♪ It's a bedtime ballet Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ With me and my friends ♪ ♪ Get ready for bed ♪ ♪ So sing along So sing along ♪ ♪ It goes like oh-oh oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ It's a It's a bedtime ballet ♪ ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ It's a It's a bedtime ballet ♪ Now I'm getting really sleepy. Dreamtime! Chelsea, like me, is also very curious and imaginative. Remember the Sea Dragon? What if we had some intellectual conversation over a fancy tea party? Uh, hello? We're forgetting that the whole story took place in the water and waves. We should transform the pool into a beach paradise party. I love these ideas! And we can't forget the pet dolphins. Chelsea loves animals. - Aww... - So cute! ♪ Our bedtime story We're gonna write ♪ ♪ Hey, Dreamhouse Can you bring it all to life? ♪ - Come on! - ♪ Imagination ♪ ♪ Is all we need ♪ ♪ Yeah, it's time for bed It's time for sweet dreams ♪ ♪ Turn your night light on Let it shine ♪ ♪ All our dreams Are coming to life ♪ ♪ We gotta jump into bed ♪ ♪ Come and sing with me ♪ ♪ It's a bedtime ballet Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ With me and my friends ♪ ♪ Get ready for bed ♪ ♪ So sing along So sing along ♪ ♪ It goes like oh-oh oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ It's a It's a bedtime ballet ♪ ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ It's a It's a bedtime ballet ♪ ♪ We're all getting sleepy ♪ ♪ Cozy in our PJs ♪ ♪ We're all getting sleepy ♪ ♪ Cozy in our PJs ♪ ♪ So wash your face ♪ ♪ Brush your teeth ♪ ♪ And say it now with me ♪ ♪ It's a bedtime ballet Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ With me and my friends ♪ ♪ Get ready for bed ♪ ♪ So sing along So sing along ♪ ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ It's a It's a bedtime ballet ♪ Sweet dreams! So... which theme do you think we should do? Hmm... I love them all so much. Aw... Let's do all of them! Mm... I'll see you later for... Don't want to keep Mr. and Mrs. Roberts waiting. Have a great soccer practice! Okay, I just... Bye, love you! - But... - Bye! See you later! Have fun! Bye! Goodb... Okay. No time to waste. Let's get started. Brooklyn, you take the living room. On it! Teresa gets the dining room, and Renee... I'll be out by the pool making the magic happen. You are magic. Thank you. Hello, Dreamhouse. Let's get started, shall we? Hello, Barbie. How can I assist you? We need to transform this room into a ballet studio. Wow. Yes! But we need mirrors. Could you make the windows... Ah! Love it! Thank you, Barbie. Now, I need to change. Perfect. Hello, Dreamhouse? We'll need a tea set. Of course, Barbie. Ooh, yes. And on the tables, can we get a delectable display of veggie tea sandwiches, cupcakes, and fruit tarts? Absolutely. That is lovely! Hello, Dreamhouse. Can you please add some floaties to the pool? Perfect. Okay, now, can we add a couple cabanas there and there, and some lounge chairs? Awesome! Oh! And how about a volleyball net over here? Oh! Thank you, Dreamhouse! This is so fun. Mm. Hello, Dreamhouse. Could I have a bunch of puppies, please? Of course, Barbie. Aww! And some kittens too, please? Aw, thanks, Dreamhouse. No problem! Hmm... it just doesn't feel Dreamday special enough. Hello, Dreamhouse? Dreamhouse? How may I assist you, Barbie? Could we add bunnies? If you dream it... Oh, wait a second. Uh... Barbie? Could you make the animals fun different colors, please? Aw! Perfect. Will you please excuse me? Renee is calling. Thank you, Dreamhouse. Now, let's see how everyone else is doing with their parties. Wow. It's perfect, isn't it? Yeah. But maybe... How about a disco ball and a light show? Um... Hello, Dreamhouse. Would you mind? Keep going. Make it magical. - How's it going? - Great! I'm brainstorming all the cool things we can talk about with Chelsea. Should we contemplate the vastness of the stars, space, and the universe first, or the wondrous world of mold? Hmm... Huh, what am I thinking? Por supuesto, it should be... Hello, Dreamhouse? What are the differences and similarities between llamas and alpacas? Uh, the average alpaca weighs 150 pounds, whereas a llama can weigh up to 400 pounds, although both llamas and alpacas have a similar alarm call when they sense danger. It sounds like this. Okay, thank you. That was... informative. Oh, hey, Barbie, what do you think? About llamas? The tea party! Oh! It's fantastic. But... we need a centerpiece. Hello, Dreamhouse? Can we get a giant cake right here, please? Bigger! Bigger! That's perfect! Isn't this incredible? Yes, it is, but it can be even more incredible. Hello, Dreamhouse... add palm trees! You got it, Barbie. Awesome! And a waterslide! Oh! Yes, yes, Barbie. It's... my pleasure. That... is... so... epic! Malibu, I think you should stop for just a second. No time. Can't stop. Chelsea will be back soon! We need to dream bigger. Hello, Dreamhouse! Add giraffes and zebras and... ...lions! Lions?! Right. Bad idea. Scrap the lions. Dreamhouse, how about we scrap all large animals... for safety. Okay, Dreamhouse, let's get to work. Okay, Barbie.

Oh... He-hello, Bar-bie... bie-bie-bie-bie... Hello. Wow. I am so sorry, Dreamhouse. I got carried away. You tried to warn me. Hey, I got caught up in it all too. Oh, I should have realized we were overworking the programming. Hello, Barbie. Man, we totally crashed the poor Dreamhouse app. Now everything is ruined, and Chelsea could be back any minute! Let's not panic. It's not too bad. Okay, it's pretty bad, but we got this! Like my Granny Vi always said, remember to K.I.S.S. "Keep It Simple, Silly." But I wanted things to be perfect... not simple, and certainly not... this. You wanted things to be special, not perfect. Simple can be special. Our hearts were in the right place, but trying to make four massive individual parties... Was way too complicated. You're right. I lost sight of who this was all for... Chelsea. We just need to make one unforgettable party. Exactly. And we can still make an unforgettable Dreamday together! But instead of separate parties, we'll have one beach, ballet, tea party Dreamday! With animal friends! Right. We can do this. If we work together. We got this!

He-hello, Ba-Barbie... bie-bie-bie-bie-bie. Hello, Barbie. I feel much better. I needed some time to recharge. I am so sorry, Dreamhouse. I got carried away. We were so not cool. I'm sorry too. I should have known better. We're all sorry, Dreamhouse. We had too many ideas that we tried to make happen all together, all at once. Thank you. Apologies accepted. Do you think maybe you have the energy to help plan a new party? But this time, we all work together as a team... with you. I'll certainly try, Barbie. Okay, but you have to promise me one thing. - Yes? - Let us know if you're getting too overwhelmed. And we'll make sure to consider how much we're asking you to do this time. Oh, thank you, Barbie. I'll be sure to speak up if I need help. Let's get to work! Chelsea should be here soon. Okay, I think we should... Hello? Hello? Is anyone home? Barbie? Where's everyone else? I thought... I'm so sorry, Chelsea. I... uh... kinda bungled your birthday party. Oh. Let's go sit down, and I'll explain. Surprise! Oh, wow. It's amazing! No! It's better than amazing. It's... splendorificious! Happy Dreamday, Chelsea. Happy Dreamday! Dreamday? What's a Dreamday? It means Barbie wanted to throw you such a perfect birthday, she almost broke the Dreamhouse creating it. That's how much she loves you. It's like a birthday... But even more special. Ee! Thank you all so much! I love it. That includes you, Dreamhouse. Aw. It truly is my pleasure, Chelsea. Mm! Whoa! Look at her moves! Go, Chels! Go, Chels! I love it! I got you. So, you see, there are projectors all around the Dreamhouse. Using light and electromagnetic imagery, The Connected Dreamhouse can create the illusion of solid objects. Mm! So cool! I got it! Whoa! I don't got it. Oh... I'm impressed. You really almost had that. Even in ballet slippers. Oh, oops! Can we go again after I change shoes? Okay, okay, enough! I guess there is such a thing as too many doggie kisses. Never! Ahh! Thank you. This is all so amazing. You know, all I really need for a special Dreamday is to spend it with all of you. You know what? I was so worried about making everything perfect... but today wasn't perfect at all. You ate way too many sandwiches, fell on the floor, and were covered in drool. And I loved all of it, so I guess that means it's not about getting things perfect. It's about how things make you feel. The imperfections make it memorable. Make it special. Present time! Ooh. They're so pretty. Thank you! I love butterflies. Ooh, one more thing. Hello, Dreamhouse. Activate wings! These wings actually work. I... I can fly?! Only inside the Dreamhouse. They won't work outside. Wow! Whee! Yeah! I love them. Thank you so much. Hello, Dreamhouse. Dim the lights, please. Of course, Barbie. How am I going to blow out those candles? Use your wings, silly. Oh, right. Hey! We need to sing first! Yeah! I know the birthday song, but what's the Dreamday song?
