Mhm! Mhm! Mmm. Mm? Mm. HAPPILY EVER AFTER UNHAPPILY EVER AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO... Hi. What are you doing? I'm waiting for you. - Are you OK? - Yes. I just came to gather strength. I still want to go a few more times. - Really? - Yes. Mmm. No. - Why not? - People can see us. - So? They'll cheer us on! - No. I don't want to go... - ever! - Me neither. I don't want to work with the accountant! Quit, baby. No, I mean it. Are you going to support me? - What's wrong with that? - Nothing. I'd love it. - I have a surprise for you. - What is it? Promise me something... That no matter what... we will always make the next day better that the last. Love each other so much that you are a bit of sun and a bit of night. Be together through the gray mornings. Laugh and watch how love defeats time. You are married now. Let's go! I love you, María José! María José! María José! Where are my pants? You've been wearing the same pants for a week! Your pants already stand by themselves. - They're my favorite... - But they have a hole in the crotch! Baby, who would look at my crotch? You're right about that... there's nothing to see. - Lower your pants, you look old. - And you look like my mom. I'm taking your car. - Why? What about yours? - It's in the shop. Why did you take it there? I said I'd fix it. - Three weeks ago! - Yes, baby, but I'm closing stuff at work and I have a lot to do! I have to help the accountant! But you help her more than you help me. Baby, come on! Centennials... Are you ready? Let's go to school. Stop it. Kids, go to the car while I say goodbye to dad. Yes, let's go. Here. Go to the car while I say bye to mom. - I heard you. - OK, last one... - Well done, baby! - Stop! Go ahead, princess. Don't talk like that in front of the children. I'm sorry, baby. - I'm very stressed out. - Why? María José... Maybe América won't make it to the league. Alfredo... América always makes it to the league. You're right. OK, you'll need to take the bus. The bus? María José, me taking the bus? - What's wrong with it? - How...? - García! - Accountant! I'm behind on the sheet balances... - I know! - Yes, of course. - I need my coffee. - Of course, ma'am. No! - Latte, lactose... - Of course. - Two sugars. - Latte, light, sugar. Desy, sit on the front. María José! María José, please... Take me to work. I'd love to, but we're running late. See you later. Say bye to daddy, kids. Bye, daddy! Ouch! We're here live on El Heraldo Televisión, Alejandro Cacho, Paulina Greenham. Yesterday was an amazing show... - Here. - He's talking to you. Thank you. Last night, women received awards from the... Did you like your surprise? Yes, baby! Thank you for the food... Well, your anniversary is an important date. Yes, baby. How could we forget such an important date? Alfredo, it's in two days. But we're celebrating today. And you're one to talk. You almost killed me and you didn't even say you're sorry. It was both our fault. Both our fault? Sure! I'm sorry for putting my foot under your tire! It's fine, I forgive you. - Quit the attitude. - María José, don't start. - I'm not liking you... - since the day started... - Enough! - Shut up! This is your 20th anniversary and I think you need to celebrate. Yes, baby but... we don't have money to celebrate right now. - Oh! - What is it? Wow! Baby... Wow. Look at this, "Happy Anniversary..." "A trip to the beach". It's just what I need. But you're going too... It's the hotel of our honeymoon. We saved our allowances, the money grandma gave me for my 15th birthday, everything Jorge won with his bets, and Nina's savings. That's how we paid for it. - No way. - It can't be. At least we're on the same page about this. It's right. So, what do we tell them? We have to tell them. Centennials... It's cool that we're all friends. Mhm. Guys, what you did for us was really beautiful, - thank you so much, but... - But daddy has to work. Yes, the month is ending and I have a lot of work. This is not a question. You have to go on this trip. But you can't stay alone, who'll take care of you? - Grandma! - My girl! So precious! How are you? I'm sorry, I know you're celebrating and I didn't want to intrude but... the kids invited me. Baby, I didn't say hi, I'm sorry! Since you're going to the beach, I bought you some sunblock. Because you always burn your ears, Alfredo. And if I don't take care of you... who will? Right? Pull your pants up, Alfredo, you look like a plumber! There. Thank you. I don't know whether to feel angry or proud of you. - They are just like their dad. - Or like their mom. We're like the both of you. Go with God, have a safe trip and a good return. Thank you! In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. Take care, son. - Yes. - Take care. - Just relax. - And try not to kill each other. Wait! Don't come back until you love each other again. Ladies and gentlemen, Saguaro Airlines welcomes you to Puerto Peñasco, Sonora. A lot of people get sick on planes. Sure, but because they get dizzy not drunk. Yes... What are your names again? María José Márquez and Alfredo García. García, Márquez... Like the writer. Sorry, yes. THIS RESERVATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED SEARCH FOR RESERVATION THIS RESERVATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED - You're not on the system. - No, that can't be! There must be something wrong, call your manager, please. - I am the manager. - Fuck! I used to manage Hibris, Mexico's biggest international company. And I went from manager to VP because I could find solutions. - Yes... - Shut up! I have a solution. The honeymoon suite. Welcome. - Your bag, please, sir. - Yes, thanks. No, thank you. We're planning on remodeling the suite but some other things have come up and... we haven't done it. Tomorrow we'll take out the boxes, brooms, and the dust, I apologize. - Hey. - Yes? What's the Wi-Fi password? No Wi-Fi up here. With caps on? No, I meant that there's no Wi-Fi up here. Oh, OK. OK but... apart from these little details, everything works great. Look, the hot tub is still there. Too bad it's broken. Oh, and the AC... is also broken. Yes... Apart from that... everything works great. Sometimes we have power outages. Tomorrow we'll fix all these little details. See you, thank you. Look! - Hello? - Happy anniversary! Good morning. How was the trip? Everything was fine, thank you. Majo, how's my son's foot? Fine, ma'am, everything's fine. Well, I'm just here cleaning up your house because it was really dirty. I'll let you talk to your son. - Hi, mommy. - Alfredito. Don't forget to put on your sunblock, please. You're in the middle of nowhere, there are no hospitals, no doctors, - and you even get fevers. - Yes, mommy. So cool, the weather is amazing. Shit! ♪ Here's your baby ♪ ♪ Your bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Hard, hard ♪ ♪ Bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Here's your baby ♪ ♪ Your bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Hard, hard ♪ ♪ Bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Here's your baby ♪ I'm sorry, ma'am, I apologize. I forgot to explain the thing with the water... No, it's not a thing. There is no water. No, there is... From four to five in the morning and sometimes at six p.m. But only for 15 minutes. It's a phenomenon. Well, you're scamming my kids. Because they spent all their savings on this. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I swear that tomorrow everything will work perfectly. Despite being the honeymoon suite, in 20 years everything falls apart. OK, I want less apologies and more action. To the left, to the right. You're fine, tomorrow you'll be good as new. Let me see what I have here. Never mix bacanora with eggnog and chiltepín. It's to die for. I'll give you a cocktail of Meloxicam, Celecoxib, Parisiprodol, and a bit of Tramadol, that will make you feel... No, you know what? I'm feeling better already. Drop your pants! - No, Doctor... - Drop your pants! It's fine. Bend over, it's fine. Relax! Here we go. Here we go. I'll count to three. One... Good morning. Nice day, huh? Yes... A lot of sun. BEACH TOURNAMENT García... Hi, accountant, how are you? I'm waiting for the... Right, sorry. - The balance! - Right! I'm sorry, I forgot to send it. There are so many things here. Could I send it later? - I'm... - Later? If you need it now, I'll send it. Of course. - Send it right away! - My pleasure. - It's been days... - See you, say hi to everyone in the office for me. - Sure, bye! - Have a... Yes! - Shit! - Auch! I'm sorry! Sir, are you hurt? No, I'm fine, don't worry. Thanks. I work here, do you want me to take you to the doctor? No, really I'm fine. It didn't hurt at all. OK then. Thanks. What happened? A risky move playing volleyball. Oh! You have to come closer, I'm stealing the other room's Wi-Fi. - Hi, dad! - Hi, baby! What happened, dad? - Did my mom hit you? - No, baby! He got hurt playing volleyball. Volleyball? But you get tired playing chess. Alfredito, look at your ears! - They're sunburnt! - Yes, mommy. Why aren't you fighting? Is grandma wearing my silk robe? Yes, she's very happy. How's the trip, are you having fun? Is the hotel the same as your remembered it? Exactly the same, baby! Excuse me, it's hot. Yes. - Oh! - What was that? Shit! Don't move him. Mom, what happened to him? - We can't stay here! - I want my money back! Calm down, please. We don't want to ruin your holidays, just for tonight, in memory of Mister Tolstoi... vodka on the house! Fine... How can you drink in a moment like this? What's the problem? I mean, may he rest in peace, but this is free alcohol. I talked to him. No wonder he killed himself. - Hi, how are you? - Hi! How's your face after the ball hit? That was your risky move? Stopping the ball with your face - is a risky move. - Of course. Did you go to the doctor? It was hard... No, I'm fine, thank you. That was brave, because it was really hard. - Thank you. - Happy anniversary to you! Happy anniversary to you! We all wish you... Happy anniversary to you! It's a gift from your kids, and they sent a note. "So you remember this day... forever". - Sir. - Sorry. Yes. - Let's go. - Yes. I'm sorry... I... Yes... How long have you two been together? Too much. OK... we'll let you celebrate. Congratulations! There isn't much to celebrate. Baby! Baby, wait! It was a joke, of course there's plenty to celebrate. - Like that old woman's ass? - Old? She's so young. Really, Alfredo? On our anniversary? You're right. Maybe there's nothing to celebrate. We were going to make every day better than the last. We made good things... I think we're just fooling ourselves. And there's only one solution for this. Divorce. Really? Is that what you want? It's not that I want it! We're hurting the kids. Look at everything they did so that we would stop fighting. I'm sorry. What do we do now? Can you sleep on the couch? Yes. I'm married to the hottest woman in Mexico! And I to the nicest man in the world! At least someone is having a good time. Happy anniversary. Same. Happy anniversary! What are you doing here? Didn't you sleep on the couch? When did I switch places? - Hello? - Happy anniversary! - Good morning. - How was the trip? Majo, how's my son's foot? Well, I'm just here cleaning up your house because it was really dirty. I think your mom has Alzheimer's. - Hi, mommy. - Alfredito. My love. Don't forget to put on your sunblock, please. Shit...! ♪ Here's your baby ♪ ♪ Your bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Hard, hard ♪ ♪ Bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Here's your baby ♪ ♪ Your bitch from the future ♪ ♪ Hard, hard ♪ ♪ Bitch from the future ♪ - There's no water! - No, there is. - From four to five... - And six to seven, and the plumber, you already said that. And I told you that you're scamming my kids, because they spent all their savings on this. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Despite being the honeymoon suite, in 20 years everything falls apart. You're fine, tomorrow you'll be good as new. Ouch! But you said the same yesterday. I don't remember it. Let me see what I have. Never mix bacanora with eggnog and chiltepín. It's to die for. I'll make you a cocktail of Meloxicam, Celecoxib, Parisiprodol, and a bit of Tramadol that will make you feel... Wait... Drop your pants, man! Drop your pants! Bend over! One... One daiquiri, please. García, I can't believe it! Good morning. I sent you the sheet... You haven't sent anything, - you're so irresponsible! - You don't have it yet? That's weird, I sent it yesterday. - Come here! - Lady, what happened? - Sure. - Don't let me down! Say hi to everyone... I can't leave the front desk. I can't be under the sun, my skin is very sensitive. - Shit! - Again, shit! Who's that? Mister Tolstoi. Didn't he killed himself? Lady, don't say that. I work here. Do you want me to take you to the doctor? The Russian is alive! What? Didn't he kill himself yesterday? It's like I lived all of this yesterday. Hi, dad! What happened, dad? Did my mom hit you? Alfredito, look at your ears! They're sunburnt! Mom, why is my dad so pale? - Kids, what day is today? - What do you mean? It's your anniversary. Oh! Happy anniversary to you! Happy anniversary to you! You must've done something. I did something? Why do you always blame me? Sorry, I'm used to it. "Used to it." Mmm... - I know what to do. - What? We'll go to sleep, and tomorrow when we wake up, - everything will be fine. - Brilliant idea! - Hello? - Happy anniversary! Uf! Ladies and gentlemen Again, it's not up to us. Saguaro Airlines doesn't fly every single day. But if you want, I can book you a flight tomorrow to Mexico City at 10 in the morning. It has to be today. I'm sorry, sir. You don't know who I am! Less apologies and more action! This is insulting to our rights as passengers. I swear I'm not with this lady. How are going to get out of here? - Let's relax. - Relax? Do you think someone will drop from the sky and come down to save us? Tsst, tsst. You need to get out of here? So we're going to stop... But chill. It's 10,000 dollars. We have... - How much do you have? - Yes, um... - 3000? - Yes, and on the card I have $17,600. Withdraw in batches of 3000, or the ATM might swallow your card. And... my ring. I won't need it anymore. It's pink coral and it's hand made. I don't think it'll be enough. Please! We just want to see our kids again. Fine... come on! Just because I have a heart of gold. Mm. This is safe, right? Of course! The safest. Excuse me, I think we should get off... Alfredo, don't be afraid! The pilot said it's safe! And I believe him but look at that... What's wrong? Why are you nervous? - Is it the money? - Yeah! - It's my cousin's. - Oh! What does he do? He's a farmer. A farmer of what? Stop, you're surrounded! - Damn! - "No name" - and "Silver doll". - I told you! Shoot! You don't have permission to take off. - Mom! I told you! - Don't be a scaredy-cat! Speed up! Don't let them catch us. You really are weird! Did we lose them? We did! We're going down. Plane going down! We hit it, plane going down! No! - Hello? - Happy...! - Your mom. - Did you hang up on her? She won't remember it anyway. Alfredo, we need to find a solution for this. We did the same yesterday and see what happened. I think we're cursed. Yes... there it is. What did you see? A tiny winged being. Who winked? A being with wings. Fine. We're cursed? It's a spell that you brought upon yourselves. Can you help us? You didn't listen to me the last time, how dare you come here and ask for help? Not even the toad can help you. Or maybe it will... if you find it. Help each other out. It's not something you're looking for. It's something you find. What did she mean? Alfredo, I don't think she knows. I think we need to go find the toad. Do whatever you want, I'm going with my kids. When you can't find a solution, find an exit. - Oh! - Ouch! Ouch! How long does the bus take? Emm, not much, about two days. One day by car. But the roads are dangerous. It's rabbits mating season and they're everywhere. Huh. Are you stealing my meds? - No. - OK. Do you have a car? - Yes, but it's the hotel's. - Give me the keys. - Excuse me? - Give me the keys! - Miss, I can't... - Give it! - I can't! - Give them to me! Please? It's a black... Jeep. "The alvarius toad has been considered a magical being with great powers for many centuries". No, move away! No, please, no! No, move away! No! No! No! Let me go! Let me go! No, no, no... No! Hi, dad! What happened, dad? Did my mom hit you? Fine... Just because I have a heart of gold. Hey... Have you considered another means of transport? Because the airplane is too flashy. - Is the engine broken? - What happened? The engine is broken? How are going to get back? For real? Hey, where are you going? Hi, dad! What happened, dad? Did my mom hit you? I fell asleep under the sun. And what happened to you, mom? Baby, if I tell you, you won't believe it. Alfredito, look at your ears! They're sunburnt! Yes, mommy. Is the hotel the same as your remembered it? - Let me see! - Hey! This girl can't stay still. Nina, do that again. Ouch! Do you remember what you said when we were getting on the cab? - No. - That we shouldn't get back until we loved each other again. That's it. - That's it! - Yes! That's it. What was that? HOME Good morning, beautiful baby. How's the love of my life? I'm great, my love! - Hello? - Happy anniversary! Thank you! - How was the trip? - It was wonderful! You know how much I enjoy being with your son and how much I love him. Majo, are you feeling well? Don't over do it. Are you sure of this, my love? Baby, of course! I always do it. And I can go through anything with you by my side. That's so cute! Really cute! One... Fuc...! See? We all have a reason to live for. You just have to find yours. Love will save the world. Damn Russian, you're really buffed. Can you put sunblock on me, my dear? Of course, darling! - García! - Hi, ma'am, good morning. You're so irresponsible! You said you'd send me... I'm with my wife and my only job is to make her happy. - Bye. - García! That was so sweet of you! It's sweet you find it sweet! Sorry, that almost hit you, right? Hey, be careful, you almost hit my wife. Sorry. I'm sorry! Look, Nina... See how mommy and daddy love each other! Look. - Ew, yuck! - You're weird! We're in love. - What was that? - What was that? - It was Cupid, honey. - Yeah. Happy anniversary! How long have you been together? Twenty years. But they'll never be enough. Never enough! Hey... - What if we try? - No. Sure? - Maybe it works. - What...? Baby, this has been one of the happiest days of my life but... I'm so tired, you understand, right? Of course, my dear. I'll always understand you. Well... Good night, my love. - I love you so much, my dear! - I love you too. HOME - Hello? - Happy... anniversary! - See? I told you. - What? What do you mean what? We had to... Do you think that'll help? In memory of Mister Tolstoi... vodka on the house! - Oh! - Oh! Cheers! More! No, I'll be on top. Oh! Oh, God! OK. - No, wait. - Now what? - Wait. - What is it? - Wait just a little. - What happened? Alfredo junior is distracted. You know what? No. Not this. I'm done! We'll take this seriously. Yes. - Oh! - Baby, you're bleeding! - I don't care, kiss me! - OK. Alfredo, I'm getting wet. - Good. It was about time. - No! It's water! Make it stop! Oh! María José? Why! - Cover it! - I hate it! Come on, it's not a big deal. It is a big deal. For a man this is a very tough thing. Not tough enough. Sorry. Happy anniversary to you! Hard, hard Bitch from the future Here's your baby Drop your pants! Please try to not die today. You have no shame. I gave you the best speech and you still killed yourself. - Hello? - Happy anniversary! I give up. What do we do? Why don't we just relax, take a few days, take it easy and let it flow? I don't understand. What do you mean? I've been working nonstop for 20 years, we're on the beach, we don't have to go back home, it's any working man's fantasy! Plus when I relax, I have the best ideas. A 40% tip. Thanks you crazy bastard! Whatever you need whenever you're here. García! You haven't sent... I can't hear you! There's... And... Can you hear me? Sorry, it almost hit you. Don't worry about it. I have good reflexes. Hey! Thank you! Oh! I'm sorry, Russian, you must've died a lot of times. I can imagine. Thank you. You're not ugly, Russian. Screw it! I'll give you something to live for. What's your name? Yes, I'm María José Márquez, you're Tolstoi what? Oh my God! This one... This is the first time I... No, wait! Wait, it's just that I haven't done this in a while, not even with my husband! So, I need like... to prepare a little bit more, because if you and I knew each other a bit more I'd be more relaxed, because I'm really tense! And I don't... Wait! Damn Russian! This is Jorgito, as handsome as his dad. I just need to know who his dad is. This is Desy, my teenager. Here she was in a good mood, although her face says otherwise. And my princess Nina. The apple of my eye. The most beautiful thing in my life. Do you always talk this nice about the people you love? Yes. No, sorry... - I can't. - Sorry. Will your mom support her too? Baby... - Listen, please. - No! Don't even think about it! I don't care if you sleep with her. I almost did it with the Russian before he killed himself again. What? You forgot about the call with the kids. If you want to get out of here, don't do it for me, at least do it for them. Alfredo, I'm sorry for blaming you for everything. We are both responsible. It hasn't been easy to leave my job to take care of the kids. I liked my job. I didn't ask you to leave your job. You didn't ask me to keep it either. Actually, you're lucky. I'd love to stay all day at home with the kids. I don't like what we are now. Me neither. What do we do? Keep trying. - Hello? - Happy anniversary! Ma'am, don't wear my clothes. I study Russian. Nice and up. Yei! Drop your pants, man! Ready? Ready! Hi, dad! Happy anniversary to you! One, two, three. To know the world... To know the world... Come on! To know the world and everything in it. To know the world and everything in it. To know the world and everything in it. To know the world and everything in it. Are you OK? Are you talking to me? Yes, are you OK? Yes, everything's fine. Thanks. A few things here and there, nothing major. Everything's fine, thanks for asking. Yes, all good. This way, please. Don't worry. That rat is dead. Relax. This way, please. This is the problem. They were supposed to send some Japanese electricians. But they haven't arrived, I'm not sure why. Damn, it looks hard. What? Don't say that. I told your wife I'd fix it. And with all due respect, I'm scared of her. I don't blame you. But deep down she's a good person. You know what? I can help you. Do you know about this? I took a class once in high school. I built a little machine. So I think I can do it. Yes. Yes... Yes. Where is the library? Thank you! - Wanna play? - I don't know how to play. You don't have to, just come! Come on!
