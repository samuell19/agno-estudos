[WILLY CRIES] Man: COME AND TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS-- A SIGNAL I RECORDED THE OTHER NIGHT. I WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IT WOULD SOUND LIKE TO US. I BROUGHT IT DOWN A COUPLE HUNDRED OCTAVES. THIS IS WHAT I GOT. [SQUEALING] THAT'S NO ANIMAL I'VE EVER HEARD. IT'S NOT AN ANIMAL. YOU'RE SURE OF THAT? MMM, IT'S JUST A LOOP-- PLAYS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. A LOOP OF WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOY? IS THAT A HARPOON? IT'S A SPEAR FROM A SPEAR GUN. [GRINDER BUZZES] WHAT'S THIS? THAT'S JUST A TOOL OF THE TRADE WE USE, TO KEEP IT AFLOAT UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO BRING IT ON BOARD DOWN HERE. WHAT HAPPENS OVER HERE? THAT'S WHERE WE HARVEST THE MEAT, THEN WE PACKAGE IT. AND FREEZE FOR SHIPPING. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] WHO DO YOU SELL IT TO? NORWAY, RUSSIA, JAPAN. THERE'S A BIG UNDERGROUND MARKET FOR WHALE MEAT. UNDERGROUND? YOU MEAN ILLEGAL. IT'S $200 A POUND, KID. Father: THERE YOU ARE. IT'S A GOOD TIME TO LEARN THE HARPOON. MEANS A LOT TO ME, MAX, YOU BEING HERE. ME, TOO, DAD. GET UP TO THE BOW THERE. [CRIES] [CRIES] [SINGS] WAY TO GO, JESSE. THANKS. WHO'S THAT? WHO? WITH WILLY. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY KNOW EACH OTHER.

Randolph: ENOUGH FOOLING AROUND. COME HERE, GIRL. Jesse: OK, WILLY, TAG TIME. NOW I'LL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO FIND YOU. Jesse: WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M NOT SURE. IS SHE SICK?

YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU SEE ANYTHING, KID? NOT A THING. [WHALES SING] KUJIRA! WHAT'S KUJIRA? SOUND THE HORN. [HONK] YOU READY, MAX? OK. LET'S GO FISHING. I'VE GOT THE SPEAR. Father: AIM RIGHT THROUGH THE CROSS HAIRS DOWN THE END OF THE CANNON BARREL. LIKE THIS? REMEMBER, AIM WHERE THE TARGET'S GOING TO BE, NOT WHERE IT'S AT, MAX. IF YOU AIM AT THE TARGET, YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO MISS. READY? WAIT. WAIT. NO! HAND ME THE NEXT ONE. I GOT IT. Father: NO, MAX. LET SANDERSON DO IT. KEEP STILL! KEEP STILL! HURRY UP! DON'T MOVE. DROP IT! JUST GIVE IT TO ME. STEP ASIDE! DAD, A SHIP! CAPTAIN! GET BELOW, KID. MOVE, MOVE! COME ON. PICK IT UP! Jesse: IS THAT A WHALING SHIP? NO HARPOON. THAT'S THEM, RANDOLPH. THAT'S GOT TO BE THEM. WILLY WOULDN'T DO THAT UNLESS IT WAS THEM. YOU HAVE TO CALL THIS IN. KID, THERE'S NOTHING TO CALL IN. YOU SAW IT YOURSELF. WILLY WENT AFTER THAT BOAT. HE WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF. THEY ATTACKED HIM. AND YOU KNOW THAT FOR A FACT? Jesse: IT'S OBVIOUS. IF YOU'D OPEN UP YOUR EYES... SIR. BOTANY BAY CHECKS OUT. IT'S A REGISTERED SALMON BOAT. ITS CAPTAIN, JOHN WESLEY, IS LICENSED, AND HIS RECORD IS CLEAN. YOU'RE RIGHT. IF THEY WERE WHALERS, THEY'D HAVE A BIG NEON SIGN SAYING, "ARREST ME, I KILL WHALES." HELLO? DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO CALL MARINE PATROL AND TELL THEM THAT A WHALE TOLD US THERE ARE WHALERS OUT HERE? YOU COULD HEAR THEIR LAUGHTER WITHOUT USING YOUR RADIO. STEVENS, SET COURSE FOR PORT. YES, SIR. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. THEY'RE WHALE KILLERS, AND YOU'RE LETTING THEM GO. WE'RE DUE IN PORT, AND PORT IS WHERE WE'RE GOING. Randolph: WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? EXCUSE ME? FOR YOU TO MAKE THE CALL. PROOF! YOU SHOW ME SOME PROOF, I'LL BE HAPPY TO CALL IT IN. Jesse: THAT GUY'S A JERK. YOU'RE RIGHT HE'S A JERK. YOU JUST NOTICED THIS? I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME HE'S JUST DOING HIS JOB. WELL, HE IS JUST DOING HIS JOB. THE WHALERS ARE JUST DOING THEIR JOBS. WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOLLOW ORDERS AND DO NOTHING TO STOP THEM. IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. YOU KEEP THIS UP, YOU'RE GOING TO GET ME FIRED. IF WE CAN'T FOLLOW THE WHALES, MAYBE WE CAN GET THEM TO FOLLOW US. THEN WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THEM. WE CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON THEM ALL THE TIME. TODAY OR NEXT YEAR, THESE MONSTERS WILL FIND THEM. AND WE WON'T BE THERE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT'S COMING FROM THAT BOAT. WHAT IS? THAT SOUND THAT DIDN'T QUITE SOUND LIKE A WHALE. WHAT THE HELL IS IT? I CAN TELL YOU THIS-- EVERY TIME WE FIND WHALES, THAT BOAT'S NOT FAR BEHIND. AND THERE'S THAT SIGNAL AGAIN. THEY PLAY THE SIGNAL, AND THE WHALES COME. YOU HAVE IT ON TAPE, RIGHT? YES, SIR. SO WE COULD BROADCAST THIS OURSELVES IF WE WANTED TO, COULDN'T WE? MM-HMM. WE'D HAVE TO GO INTO PORT FOR A FEW PARTS. IF THEY CAN DO IT, SO CAN WE. YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO MAKE THAT THING BROADCAST, AND WE CAN MAKE THE WHALES COME RIGHT TO US. [SIGHS] WHAT'S KUJIRA? WHERE'D YOU PICK THAT UP? SANDERSON. THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED THEM. IT'S A KIND OF SUSHI. IT'S A USE FOR KILLER WHALES, MAX. WE HARVEST THE MEAT AND SELL IT TO THE JAPANESE TO EAT. OH. WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR GRANDFATHER WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT? WHAT? "IS THAT GOD'S WORK, SON, SUSHI FOR THE JAPANESE?" I DON'T GET IT. GOD'S WORK. THAT'S WHAT DAD SAID WHALING WAS BECAUSE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, THE WHALES THEY KILLED MADE OIL THAT FILLED THE LAMPS THAT LIT THE WORLD. WHALERS MADE LIGHT. IT WAS WORK THAT MEANT SOMETHING THEN. WHAT DOES IT MEAN NOW? IT MEANS YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE WHAT YOU ARE... TO MAKE A LIVING. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. [HONK HONK] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLICK] [HONK] Man: HANG ON TO IT! HI. WHAT CAN I GET YOU? UH, 2 CUPS OF COFFEE, PLEASE. SURE. NO SALE. COASTAL MARINE PATROL DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A POSSIBLE WHALING I.D. THEY SAY CALL WHEN YOU HAVE-- PROOF. I KNOW. WHAT DO THEY CALL PROOF? Randolph: SHORT OF ACTUALLY CATCHING THEM RED-HANDED, I HAVE NO IDEA. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE? Randolph: THAT'LL BE ALL, THANK YOU. WE HAVE TO GET ON BOARD. THEN WE GET THE PROOF THAT WE NEED. ON BOARD THE BOTANY BAY? A WHALER SHIP FULL OF WHALES. ARE YOU CRAZY? I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT SOME LOCAL FISH MERCHANTS, POKE AROUND, SEE IF I COME UP WITH ANY HARD EVIDENCE. MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED-- WE STICK OUT LIKE SORE THUMBS AROUND HERE. THAT'S ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS SNEAKING ON THEIR BOAT. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THE SHIP. I AM? I'VE ALREADY ASKED DREW TO FIND SOMETHING TO KEEP YOU BUSY. RANDOLPH, BUT-- I PROMISED BEN AND ANNIE, REMEMBER? NOW GET GOING. DREW'S EXPECTING YOU. NOPE. PERFECT. GREAT. HI. YOU WORK ON THE BOAT? SURE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MAX. WHAT'S YOURS? RANDOLPH. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT? WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR WORK. DOING WHAT? I'VE DONE HERRING, MACKEREL, SALMON, ORCA. WHAT'S ORCA? WELL, IT'S A TYPE OF WHALE.

Father: JUST SIGN ON THE LINE. WHAT'S GOING ON? [BEEP BEEP] HEY, MAX! I GOT TO GO. WHAT'S YOUR DAD REALLY FISHING FOR? MY DAD'S A SALMON BOAT CAPTAIN. OH. YEAH, WELL, HE IS. I LIED TO YOU. BIG WHOOP. [SIGHS] I'M NOT A WHALER. SO WHAT? WELL, I'M SORT OF THE OPPOSITE. YOU'RE A WHALE? NO, BUT I'M TRYING TO PROTECT THEM. [SIGHS] WHAT HE'S DOING'S WRONG, AND YOU KNOW IT. WHO? YOUR DAD. MY DAD'S A SALMON BOAT CAPTAIN. WHY DO YOU CARE, ANYWAY? IF ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS WAS IN TROUBLE, WOULDN'T YOU TRY TO HELP THEM? IF I COULD. MY FRIENDS ARE WHALES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SURE YOU DO. [SIGHS] I'LL SHOW YOU. WHAT? THE WHALES. I'LL INTRODUCE YOU. WHOA! COME HERE. THAT GAMEBOY TELLS YOU WHERE WHALES ARE? NOT ALL, JUST ONE. Jesse: LISTEN. [WHALES SING] THEY'RE CLOSE. [WHALES SING] IT'S QUITE A SOUND, ISN'T IT? YEAH. DO YOU KNOW AN ORCA IS MOSTLY WATER? SURE. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN HE SINGS, YOU CAN FEEL THE BEAT OF HIS SONG IN TIME WITH THE WAVES. [WHALES SING] WHY DO THEY DO THAT? I SAY IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD MUSICIANS, BUT A FRIEND OF MINE THINKS DIFFERENTLY. HE SAYS THE WHOLE EARTH IS BREATHING. AND THAT THEIR SONG IS THE EARTH BREATHING. [BIRD SQUAWKS] Jesse: THERE THEY ARE. CAN I LOOK? YEAH. HERE. THANKS. OH, YEAH. [SQUEAK] [WHALES SING] Max: WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! HEY, BOY. WHERE'D HE GO? [SINGING] HE LIKES TO PLAY GAMES. WHAT GAMES DOES HE KNOW? [THUD] FETCH. FETCH BY FAR HIS FAVORITE. WHAT DOES HE FETCH? YOU'LL SEE. Max: WHAT? I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM TAKE TO ANYONE LIKE THAT BEFORE... EXCEPT ONCE. I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS LIKE THAT WITH EVERYONE. NO. HE'S ONLY LIKE THAT WITH FAMILY. WELL, I'M NOT HIS FAMILY. TELL HIM THAT. IS THIS YOUR JOB? YEAH. DO YOU LIKE IT? OH, YEAH. I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE HAD JOBS LIKE THAT. NEITHER DID I. HEY, TURN IN THERE. ME AND MY DAD BUILT THIS PORCH LAST SUMMER. OH, YEAH? IT'S A BIG FAMILY. Max: YEAH. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE A BIG FAMILY LIKE THIS? OH, JUST LIKE ANY FAMILY, YOU KNOW? NO, I DON'T. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. WHAT? EVEN THOUGH HE'S DOING SOMETHING WRONG, HE'S STILL YOUR DAD. YOU DROPPED THIS. I DON'T WANT IT. STOP HIM MYSELF. [DOOR CLOSES] JESSE? JESSE? [STATIC] JESSE? [WHISPERING] Randolph? WHERE ARE YOU? I'M GETTING THE PROOF WE NEED. WHERE ARE YOU? IF I TELL YOU, YOU GOTTA PROMISE NOT TO BE MAD AT ME. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'LL DO TO YOU IF THEY CATCH YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO WILLY IF THEY CATCH HIM? NOW I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU THAN I AM ABOUT WILLY. LISTEN. WESLEY'S STILL AT THE BAR. KEEP HIM THERE. I DON'T WANT THIS BOAT LEAVING WITH ME ON IT. JESSE-- SORRY, GOTTA GO! JESSE? [VIDEO GAME BEEPS] MOM? YES, MAX. WHAT DO YOU DO IF SOMEBODY'S MAKING YOU DO SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO? WHO? OH, JUST SOMEONE. YOU SHOULD NEVER LET OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. YOU HAVE TO STICK UP FOR YOURSELF. YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT. DO YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT'S RIGHT, EVEN IF IT HURTS? THAT'S THE HARDEST PART. YOU SHOULD DO IT EVEN IF IT HURTS. IS THAT WHAT YOU DO, MOM? I TRY MY BEST. UHH! ALL RIGHT! BED. NO. BED. NO. WE'LL TAKE 2 OF THE TALL ONES. THANKS A LOT. [MAN LAUGHING] PUT THAT AWAY. YOU SHOULD GO GET THE CAPTAIN.

HONEY, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT? HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO GO TO JAIL. THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? THEY'D TAKE AWAY HIS BOAT, THAT'S ALL. MAYBE MAKE HIM PAY A FINE. PROMISE? YEAH, I PROMISE.
