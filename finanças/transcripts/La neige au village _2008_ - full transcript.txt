It's horrible, she plays with her and... Is that Ricardo? With the comparative advantage... Girls! Girls! Two Mexican girls? Well done. VILLAGE IN THE SNOW You're going out? And you're staying in? Yeah. See you later. Bye. - Hi, Patrick! - Don't start, ok. No results until 3 now. Until 3? Think that's funny? We'll see who gets the last laugh. What shall we do? Wait near here? No, I'm going to Axel's. I'll come back later. See you here at 3? - See you later. - Ok. Girls! Girls! Alfredou, I'm bored stupid. What are you doing? Yeah? Me, not a lot. No, we'll be using my uncle's car. We'll try to fit my stuff in it. Tell me anyway. Two Mexican girls? Well done. I'm listening. You lucky bastard... Ok. I'll call you back. No, I'll call you. Talk to you later. Thank you. Go ahead, I take it easy. Who are you looking for? I've found it, thanks. I'm sorry to bother you. Doesn't Camille live here anymore? Camille? Camille who? Camille Barta. - Camille who? - Barta. No. Oh, right. Sorry to have bothered you. Goodbye. Are you following me? - No. - You are. I saw you at the park. Actually... A guy was following you. But it wasn't me. Really? I was following the guy following you. He was just behind you at the park. He took the chewing gum you dropped in the bin. And he followed you here. And so did I. A redhead in a black sweater. He's a pervert. A notorious pervert. He attacked a girl once. He really hurt her. - You were afraid for me? - Exactly. Next time I see you, I call the cops. What? The cops? But I didn't... Excuse me... Are you following me? So I'm a notorious pervert? What? You said... I was... I just said that for no reason. You'd like to be a notorious pervert? No. - So it's not true? - No. Why did you tell her that? I don't know. She didn't believe me so I... What you do is weird. It's odd following people like that. Why are you after her? Hi, this is Charlotte, Leave me a message, It's Marion. Couldn't you pick up for once? Something weird has happened to me. A guy followed me home. Two guys in fact. I'll explain. I don't know what to do. They came to my place. It's weird... I'll call you back. Take care. Hi, bunny boy. Hi. Stop calling me bunny boy. So, what's new? Only old stuff? I followed a guy. That makes a change. What can I get you? Pastis. How do we always end up in this bar? Do you know a girl called Vignaud? A blond? Kind of. You know her? No, I don't know her. Right, we never pick up in the afternoon. That's when we should pick up. Because at night... Give me a cigarette, please. What are you doing, asshole? Nothing. Not a great match. And we're world champions... Yeah, it's weird. I'm still hungry. Have you eaten? I can't. My stomach's all knotted up. Stress. - Been running? - No. It's because of your T-shirt. - It's kind of athletic. - Yeah. - It doesn't suit you. - I know. What's that? A skank. A babe! Excuse me, miss! So you're going away? Where to? Lyon. I have an uncle there. Lyon? It must be good there too. I don't know the place. - Where are you? - Not far away, pal. Get here, We're going, You're my rabbit's foot, I need you, It's me, I got your message, Where are you? I fell asleep. What time is it? Quarter past, The shits haven't put the results up, - A guy really followed you? - Yes, it's true. All the way home? - Who is he? - What? Who is he? I don't know. I think I'll take the car. Why? Think they're still there? No, I don't think so. Listen, I'll be there in ten minutes. - No, five. - Ok, See you. Ok? Good? Shall we go? Doing anything tomorrow? I have to see my mom. She needs help to buy a couch. And you? I don't know. I'll start tidying up. I'll buy a lottery ticket. It'll bring me luck. Are you coming? - Can't you get some cigs instead? - Come on. The results are up. What do they say? Just a second. - Want me to tell you? - No, wait for me. - You're sure? - Yes. - Whatever, See you, - See you. Slow and calm in total silence, It falls, flurries And floats around, Drifting in the emptiness, And concealing in the colourless sky, The church with its sleeping bell tower, Not a sigh, not a breath, Everything is draped and muffled Wrapped in stillness,,, It is It is peace, dense and cold That spreads across the whole world, The deep peace of winter, Village in the snow Based on the poem by Francis Yard Subtitles: lan Burley Leanne Miller (poem) Processed by: C.M.C. - Paris
