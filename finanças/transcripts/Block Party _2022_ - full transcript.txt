Your first day, you're wearing those Michael Kors flats with that cute little... -Mom. - ...Sparkle on the-- Yeah. I got this. I'm gonna start work on Monday. Rule the world by Tuesday. just like we planned. Listen, you're working for theCrystal Maitland, Keke, okay? This is very important. You worked so hard for this. Your dad and I spent a lot for that degree. As if you gave me any other option -but to wildly succeed. - Don't screw it up. - Wear the damn shoes. -[Sean] Hey sweetie, Tash. -Daddy, How are you? - Oh hey, Miss Harvard MBA! When you coming home? I made pecan pie. Yeah, and just so you know, I ate it all. -[Tasha] He did. -[Sean] Oh! Guess who I saw at that Thai place on Diamond that gives me gas? Your old beau Will. Dad, I told you years ago. Will is dead to me. Just sayin'. The dead is looking pretty good. - I'll be right back, okay? -[phone alert dings] [Tasha] Oh no, wait a minute. Gram-jam's been rushed to the hospital. -Wait, what? - Baby girl, I don't know. But you know what? I'm on it. -Mom, is she okay? - Keke, I got it. [sighs] Oh! You know what, Sean? Take my gun again and see what happens. -[ambulance sirens] -[Dr. Ligon] So how's the block party coming? It's the 40th anniversary, you know. My family never misses it. Great. It's the 40th anniversary, you know. Janice, I want you to remember these five words and repeat them for me in the same order, okay? -Okay. -Blue, clock, train, white, Texas. Blue, clock, Texas, white, racist. [upbeat music] Well, my mama may be falling apart, but my baby girl is starting a brand new job -with theCrystal Mait-- -[Debra] Maitland. We know, we know. You done told us a hundred damn times. You know what, Debra? I can't with you. Where the hell have you been? Since when y'all started being punctual? Well, we all are here. Everybody loves your mom. Don't pretend you don't know. It's easy to enjoy the game with box seats. -[Jim farts] -[Sean] Tash. I need me a change of Depends. -Go. You do it. -No, you. -He depending on you. -It's your turn. [Daryl] No, it's your turn. -Remind me-- -[exclaims] My baby! -[Debra] Keke! -[Daryl] What! C'mon! -Hi baby. Okay. -What are you doing here? -Why are you in Michigan? -Don't worry. I go back tomorrow. I just wanted to come for the weekend -to check on Gram-jam. -Yeah, Tasha, come on. -Just give your daughter a hug. -Come on, give your mama a hug. Oh my goodness. Honey, how long have you had these nappy things on your head? Twenty weeks? You smell like old hot dog water and trap house carpet. -Baby, her hair is fine. -[Tasha] Sean. She is working for a Fortune 500 company. She's not a bassist in a reggae band. I was going to have them taken out and then you call-- Never mind. How's Gram-jam? -Hey, y'all. Sorry we late. -Hey. Hey, Keke. How's it going? Hey, you remember me, right? Your cousin-in-law. -Married your cousin here. -Yes, Ben, I remember you. Eboni, your braid looks on point. Thank you. It must be nice not to care about your appearance. You're so brave, girl. I couldn't do it. [upbeat music] Bunny rabbit, you're here! -[laughing] -Gram-jam! [Tasha] Well, your daughter's here too. -And your other granddaughter. -[Janice] You look so good. I'm so glad you made it in time for Summer Sizzle. It's the 40th anniversary, you know. Oh, I can't wait to play our song. Gram-jam, I can't stay for Summer Sizzle. We talked about this on the phone, remember? Mom, you know, Keke's got to get back to Atlanta tomorrow. She's working with theCrystal Maitland Monday morning, the number one Black entrepreneur in America. -I told you this. -But Keke, the doctor says my mind ain't what it used to be, and I'm going to need a lot of help to make sure that the Summer Sizzle is going to be a success. And it's the 40th anniversary this year. I've got to do my finale. [sighs] [Tasha] Ma, look. I, um... I don't think you're going to be able to run the block party this year, with or without help. Has Gram-jam been repeating herself a lot lately? Are you kidding me? One minute she's in and the next she's out. Just like your Black card. You'd know that if you were here more than Christmas and Easter. Excuse me, Mrs. McQueen, could we speak for a moment? [Tasha] Yeah. Be right back, Mom. [Janice] You have to run the block party this year. I wish I could stay. I really do. -But I can't. -You remember how much fun we used to have? Oh! [laughs] And our dance. ♪ Ooh, baby... - ♪ You got that... Whatever it was. -[both laugh] [Tasha] Dr. Ligon seems to think that Gram-jam should be fine for now, with a part time at-home caregiver. But at some point, with her dementia, she's going to need full-time assisted living. [Sean] I don't even want to think about how much that assisted living is going to cost. I'm sure a part-time nurse won't be cheap either. No. I'm going to start getting them checks ready because the first candidate for her nurse starts tomorrow -on a trial basis. -I don't like the idea of some stranger in Gram-jam's house. How do we know we can trust this person? Well, if you want to meet her, come with us tomorrow afternoon. My flight's at 4 p.m. I was meaning to ask you for a ride to the airport. [Tasha] You can meet her via Zoom from Atlanta. [upbeat music] ♪ Ooh, baby, I think I love ya... ♪ I'll change my flight to a later time. -It's no big deal. -There you go. You know, you're gonna work my last nerve. You're getting on that plane, right after you get that hair done. Say something, Sean. Mm-hmm. [upbeat music] [Daryl] You remember the year DeBarge reunited onstage? Ooh, and some of them still look damn good today. You always wanted one of them pretty-haired, light skin DeBarge people. There she is! The Harvard graduate, two times over. We were just talking about all the old Summer Sizzles. Thanks for taking my braids out on such short notice. Anything for you. Now your mama called, she wants me to give you a condition, a cellophane and beachy wave. Yes, she thinks straightened hair is far more professional. Tasha's been listening to too much Paul Mooney, God rest his soul. What's that he said? "Your hair relaxed, -white people relaxed." -[chuckles] [all] "If your head nappy, they ain't happy." [all laugh] So your mama sends you all the way to Atlanta to Crystal Maitland with some big plan to take over the world. I wish your mama would put a plan of action in place to help more with Janice. Seriously, Keke, we really appreciate what you're doing. I mean, she just wanted me to come see her. No, don't be modest. She told us that you're going to handle the block party this year. And God knows she can't do it herself. So he sent you. Amen. Yes. And the assistant director is now the director. You should book the DeBarges. Baby, that's our song. -Ooh! -[Daryl] ♪ Baby [both] ♪ All this love Is waiting for you ♪ ♪ My baby -Hey! -[both] ♪ My darling -♪ Baby, all this love... - ♪ All our love -[both] ♪ Is waiting for you - ♪ Waiting for you Do the other part, they go, -[both] ♪ Say who loves you... -Wait, no, no. I'm not taking over the block party or anything else. Well, that's what she told me. -And me. -And me. This is all news to me. [Debra] So Janice didn't ask you for help? She asked me for help, but I never said-- And you said no? [hip-hop playing] Hey, hey, hey. Morning, family. Morning Debra, Daryl. People I do not know. I brought donuts and coffee, y'all. Oh, Buddy is so nice. So sweet. I'm just a simple white boy trying to be neighborly. Especially so close to Juneteenth, am I right? Know what I'm saying? Can I get a witness? Anyway. Hey. I want to sponsor a booth in Summer Sizzle. [laughs] Who I give my cheddar cheese to? Oh, Keke's handling all that. -[Buddy] Yes! -No. Yes, queen, yes. Hey, hey, hey. My card. -[Keke] No, I-- -[Buddy sighs] I heard about Granny. Prayers went up. Glad it's all good. Amazing woman. She is the Rosa Parks of Coretta Scott Kings of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Anyway, I gots to go. -Audi 5000, y'all. -Thanks again, Buddy. Oh, and... [inhales] Your lives do matter. -[Keke] Mm. -[Daryl exhales] [exhales] Adios. That is goodbye in Mexican. Peace. [Tasha] This is the game plan. We stay strong. Under no circumstances are you to stay here and help with the block party. You know, your grandmother may have dementia, but she is still a very determined woman. Summer Sizzle is less than a week away. -And look at this mess. -Promise me that you'll get on that plane tonight. She's going to pull at your heartstrings. Your sweet tooth. Okay? She's going to use all her weapons. -She's got your number. -Mom. Your mama is right. Your grandmother is a conniving old woman, -and I say that with love. -Sean. I said I said it with love. All right, let's do it. [car doors slamming] Young William. -Hey, boy, how you doing? -What's up, y'all? Yo, Keke? What's up? Will. What are you doing here? Uh, I was actually just dropping off Gram-jam's delivery for her joint pain. I think that should be left her doctors, and not whatever it is you got going on. You're still mad at me. I understand. -I'mma see you later. -I leave tonight. So maybe next time. -[car engine starts] -[rap plays on stereo] -[Alice] Keke. -Alice. -You two know each other? -We were in third grade accelerated Chinese summer camp together. -[speaking Mandarin] -[speaking Mandarin] Your grandma's doing great, by the way. Dr. Ligon upped my steroid prescription and I'm feeling so much better. Keke, I got a surprise for you. -Wow. -[Alice] I see this a lot. Steroids often give a false sense of confidence. Uh-huh, to her and every real housewife of Atlanta. -Yeah. -[Janice] As I recall, Keke, you and Alice were close friends back in the day. Uh, close? Mom wanted me to be Alice. [Tasha] Come on, now. You know, she had such a success-minded family. Of course I wanted to be just like her. My parents loved me when I was an obedient student. Loved. [laughs] They loved me. [Alice laughing] [Tasha] Okay. Well, you know, all those Chinese immersion classes are what got my Keke into Harvard. -Isn't that right? -[Janice] Keke? You're not going to guess what I got for you. I made your favorite. So, appears she's back to her manipulative self. Now, are you sure she has dementia? She has her moments. I know you only want to hire a caregiver three days a week, but I think she probably needs five and would probably look into full time senior housing. Well, trying to find decent senior housing for working class Black folks is hard and expensive. And those places aren't really set up for Black folks. I mean, There's no bid whist or spades. Just a bunch of white folks sitting around eating food that tastes like cardboard. Baby, they don't even have hot sauce in those places. -It's a damn shame. -[Janice giggles] You're not gonna guess what I have. -[Keke squeals] -There's plenty more if you stay for Summer Sizzle. [Tasha] Mmm. Gram-jam. These have kick. Yeah, the cinnamon has got a zing to it. -Mm. [coughs] -You used to eat them in one bite. Is anything wrong? -[choking] Yummy. -Good. -I'll go get some more. -[coughs] Hey Keke, I think she probably mixed up the cinnamon and the Cayenne again. -[choking] Now you tell me? -It's like Russian roulette. Sometimes they're just fine. Dementia sometimes damages smell and taste -along with loss of inhibitions. -Oh. Did I tell you that this is the 40th anniversary -of Summer Sizzle? -Only for the hundredth time. We've got vendors, food. We've got music. All we need is you, bunny rabbit. Mama, stop it! I know what you're trying to do. [giggles] Anybody say home movie time? Home movie time! All right, all right. -[Tasha] No one said movie time. -[upbeat music on TV] -Oh boy. -[Janice] Look at us, Keke. You were so cute with those glasses. Uh-oh. [laughs] Thank God for contacts. [R&amp;B music playing on TV] Ooh. Now that's the neighborhood busboy, Dennis. Woo! Dennis is actually a huge restaurateur in the D now. -Yeah. -He used to give me those special kisses, ooh. -Right between my... [gasps] -[Tasha] Mom! Mom. -Mom, mom. -Stop it, stop it. Stop it, please. We don't need to hear all that. [Janice] Mmm, mmm. [upbeat music on TV] ♪ Head to toe... [laughing] Look at you. ♪ Today started with A crazy kiss... ♪ [Janice laughs] Come on, Keke. Let's dance. Dance like you used to. Come on, girl. -Keke. -Dance with me. Come on, Keke. They say that one of the best ways to connect -with dementia patients is through music. -[Janice] It's our song, girl. [sighs] Come on, let's show 'em. [upbeat music] [laughing] ♪♪ ♪ I got to, got to Tell ya, darling ♪ ♪ Ooh, baby, I think I love ya ♪ From head to toe [laughs] Don't enable her fantasy, Keke. ♪ Ooh, baby, I think I love ya ♪ From head to toe -[laughs] -Stop! ♪ From head to toe... ♪ I know... Okay, I'll do it. I'll stay and plan Summer Sizzle. [all shriek] [Tasha shrieking] [shriek echoes] [Keke] Thank you so much for coming to this emergency Summer Sizzle planning meeting. Janice, Gram-jam, is going to get a little help from her assistant director this year. -Keke saved the day. -[all cheer] [cheers and applause] -[Keke] We have a lot of details to go over. -So you in charge, huh? Trust me, Eboni, I don't want to be. Then maybe I should be. [Keke] Look, I understand how you might be feeling. Our family treats me differently than you. Can we please set that aside for Gram-jam? You know, I got passed over the role of running the block party this year, but I completely understand why it's you. Even though I run a local business, have a good relationship with the neighborhood, and I've been to every block party since I was born. I haven't missed one. But you, you got... What's your qualifications again? I was Gram-jam's assistant director for years. I have a degree in global strategic planning from-- Harvard. We know. You'd get it tatted on your forehead if you could. [Janice] Enough, you two. It wasn't that long ago that you would make up by braiding each other's hair. -Remember that? -Yeah, that's not happening, Grandma, Keke needs corporate hair now. Getting back to the issue-- And I'll have you know, I planned an all-Ivy a cappella summit for three years, and it was a highly-lauded event. -[Eboni] Wow. -You've been watching too many Pitch Perfectmovies. Can we get down to business? Yes. Business. I just remembered what I was going to say. We don't have any entertainment booked yet. -Wait, what? -[Daryl] Wait, wait. The block party is five days away, and you're just now saying we don't have any entertainment? [Debra] No Marvin Sapp, no El DeBarge, no DeBarges? Not one at all? Well, I really wanted to bring the funk down really hard. But before I knew it, it was summer and there was no money in the accounts. -And-- -Wait. What about the money you pay to the vendors? The stage managers, the security, the porta-potties? Well, normally the sponsors pay for all of that. -And? -And, well... This is special. It's the 40th anniversary and all. That can't be right, Alice. Well, Janice hasn't been able to go through her accounts as of lately, so she's not really up to date. But no worries. I'm very good at math. I went through all the books, and I can confidently tell you -that we have enough. -Okay. Information. Enough information to determine that... Janice is correct. You don't have any money. How are we going to pay for all of this? Well, when people come, they spend money. People come for the block party, but they spend for the music. We ain't got no stage and we ain't got no band. We're talking about throwing a party. We can't do that. [Janice] Well, I used to be a DJ back in the day. I'll spin again, no problem. Janice can DJ? She never DJ'd a day in her life. [Eboni] Y'all, don't worry about it. I'm sure Miss Harvard will figure it out. [Janice] No worries, y'all. When Jesus closes a door, God locks you in the bathroom. -[Daryl] Hmm. -[Keke] The good news is, with no money, no sponsors and no entertainment, it can't get much worse. We also don't have the required permits from the city. Oh my goodness. [upbeat music] Listen, man. Your check for the block party insurance bounced. Unless those fees are covered, I can't issue a permit. And the fees are $15,000. Fifteen thousand dollars? Fifteen thousand dollars, or there's no permit. Yes. Good night. [receiver clacking] Welcome home, cuz. So I hear the Summer Sizzle is turning out to be quite the Fall Fizzle. No, quite the opposite, actually. [Tasha] Mm. I mean, do y'all have anyone booked for entertainment? I'm working on it. -It's good. -Just smooth sailing, huh? [Sean] Mmm, oh. This is good stuff. Absolutely. So if everything's going so smoothly, Keke, why does it seem to be so hard for you to get back to Atlanta -on time? -Not having this conversation again. I said there's a family emergency. Well, Eboni says you don't have any money -or any sponsors. -Eboni's full of shit. No cussing in this house, Keke. Damn, these ribs, though. It tastes like God's own slow-cooked cow. I mean, could you imagine how good God's own slow-cooked cow must taste? This damn good right here. [laughs] Right? This damn... This good right here. I'm sorry. I just don't understand why my daughter would throw away a dream job for some silly block party. Just don't understand why my mother is so cold. -Not sorry. -Watch your tone, Keke. -This is my last time telling you. -Tasha. Keke. Ribs. Fine. Oh. Oh my goodness, baby. These are very tender. -You were not lying. -Good ribs, Dad. -Tender is the word, right? -[Tasha] Yeah. Now that I have your attention and a mouth full of ribs, Keke, if you need local sponsorship, Will Rencher is your ticket, baby. I understand that he's quite the businessman. Dad, I told you, I'm never trusting Will again. [Tasha] Sean, she said she wants nothing to do with him. Keke's just bitten off a little more than she can chew. I do have a couple of businesses, but in my free time I like to give financial literacy courses. And I think these days it's more about creating generational wealth in the Black community. That was the topic of my dissertation. Oh. Caught the attention of Crystal Maitland. Word. TheCrystal Maitland. -Yeah. -[laughs] Oh, wow. [Keke] I'm glad to see you're doing so well. [Will] I'm okay. Guess you didn't need the Ivy League after all. Yeah. [exhales] The Ivy League thing. That just wasn't for me. We had a plan, Will. Key, you had a plan. Taking over the world was never part of my plan. But you could have told me that before Freshman move-in day. You lied to me. Okay. Let's just say I told you the truth. "I'm not going." Would you have still gone? That's right. I didn't think you would. Then your mom would've had to kill me for ruining your future. Then, c'mon now. -The most painful way possible. -[laughs] Exactly. I rest my case. I'm sorry. So what's up? You need help with these sponsors, -or what's up? How can I help? -Yes, I do. Okay. But I need one thing in return. What? Stick around for a little bit. I miss your vibe. Oh, it's my vibes you miss? [atmospheric music] [Alice] You sure you want to spend your own money? Isn't that like your rainy day account? [sighs] God, I used to have a rainy day account. Well, let's go buy a $15,000 piece of paper. [scatting] Bam! [scatting] Shit! Excuse me? Mr. Fire Marshal? -Mm-hmm. -[Keke] Sorry we're late. I have the money for Janice Summers' block party. -No. -[Keke] Right here. No, baby girl. No, no, no. Listen. Summer Sizzle is a Grand Rapids institution. Your grandmother was celebrating Juneteenth way before it was a federal holiday. I go every year just to get them chicken wings, the little chicken wings. Oh my God! Come on! I got you. Really, because that's not what it sounded like -on the phone. -I had to cover. Do you know how we do when white people around. So I got to put on that white voice. [mocking voice] "Uh, I got ya. Come down here and pay your goddamn bill." I got you. Okay? Thank God. I was hoping this didn't turn into some bureaucratic nightmare. Gus never follows the rules. That's why he's always on probation. -Ain't that right, Gus? -Whatever, Joy. Let me see your paper. You know, why don't you ever play the office lottery pool? -You clearly love the lottery. -Uh-huh. Because I play what Jesus wants me to play. -Okay. -Okay. Ain't nobody asked her. -She do what Karen want to do. -[snorts] Karen, good one. Thanks for everything, Gus, we really appreciate it. Okay, just tell me where I need to stamp this. Then you guys will be on your way. Keke, those are $30 scratchers. -They make $30 scratchers? -Yeah. You don't lose big, -you can't win big. -[Joy] That's not true. That's why we have the office lotto in the first place. We spread out the risk so we could share in a massive reward together. Sometimes Black people want to win stuff by themselves, Joy. -[groans] -Just because you got the Anita Baker haircut, don't mean you know what Anita Baker went through. Damn! Sorry, I didn't mean for you guys... to hear that. Um. [clears throat] Fifteen thousand seems a bit excessive. Paperwork seems to be in order. You good. Oh my God, you're going to let me keep the money? We good. You're not even gonna look at their permit paperwork? I ain't gonna do shit but scratch this. You want to stop this? Because I'm gonna tell you right now. You stop me-- Oh shit! I won. I won. I won the lottery. I-- Let me be cool, let me be cool. They say Black people act-- [shouting] I motherfucking won! That's right! Now! Cheetos is on the house! You get some Cheetos! You get some Cheetos! You get some Cheetos! Listen, everybody. I've had a great time being a fireman, but I quit! [cheers] You're really gonna quit this close to getting your pension? This is my pension. All my life, I wanted to go on Broadway, and sing. Listen, it's been fun working with you people. I don't mean that racially. I'm gonna write a play. I'm gonna take it to Broadway. Go see my play. Joy, follow your dreams. [singing] ♪ I... ♪ Am a fireman ♪ Fireman and rainbows ♪ And pussy cats and candy - ♪ Magical things happen -[crunching] - ♪ If you believe... -[Joy] Well. I guess that makes me fire marshal pro tem. -[singing continues] -I'll need that check. And I need another look at that paperwork. -But Gus just said-- -[makes noise] I don't care what Gus said. I do things like a Karen. Overall, that went over pretty well. One more thing. Music. Right. Kind of important. That's why we're taking a trip to Detroit. -Motown. -Impromptu trip to the D. I like it. What about Janice? Oh, Gram-jam's coming. -[cars honking] -[tires screech] Gram-jam, you have to look in your rearview mirror -before you merge! -You're making me nervous. Now stop it! They haven't taken my license yet. So that means I must be safe. Okay. Let's go over the plan again. Uh, when you see Dennis... what are you gonna say? When I see my former lover, Dennis, I'm going to talk to him about booking this fancy DJ that y'all love. -What's his name? -Dee Nice. Just so you know, I haven't seen him in... I don't know how long and the last time I saw him, my titties were sitting... [gasps] -My titties were sitting up. -[tires screech] Oh lord, I got to fix this. Gram-jam, you have to hold onto the steering wheel. -Hold on to the steering wheel. -Okay, okay. Titties are important, you know. Make it stop. Make it stop. [jazzy music] [Dennis] That's just why I love to invest in Black businesses, if the company's in the black, I invest. -Simple rule. -I think that's him. I sure hope so. Hey, stick to the plan, Gram-jam. -Dennis. -Okay buddy. Talk to you later. I'll be darned. Janice Summers, grand master of the Summer Sizzle. How you been, girl? -[Janice] It's been a while. -A good while. -Long time. -Got a nice place here, Dennis. It's a good looking place, but not nearly as beautiful as you. Hi. I'm Keke, Janice's granddaughter. I'm Alice. No relation. I remember you, Keke. Yeah. Used to run around with those little bitty glasses on, trying to boss everybody at the dunk tank. That was you. So tell me, what brings you here? Well, it's the 40th anniversary of Summer Sizzle Juneteenth. And since you have a nice D... -What did she say? -[Janice] I would love it if your nice D would perform for me. She means Dee Nice. Well, yes, that makes a little bit more sense. Let me see if I got this right. You're going to just roll up in here and try to compel me to recruit the biggest DJ in the world to host your little block party on Juneteenth. Of all days, Juneteenth. Do you know Juneteenth is Dee Nice's birthday? What makes you think I'll just pick up the phone and call him? What could compel me to do that? Will these refresh your memory? [necklace jingles] [both laugh] Consider my memory refreshed. -Here you go. -[chuckles] So he introduces her as his wife, to my boss... [all laugh] Men and their silly willies. [all laugh] Excuse the interruption, ladies, but Dee Nice's manager informs me that he will be on tour in Europe -for the next three months. -Of course he is. But you ladies enjoy yourselves, have whatever you'd like to drink. It's on me. Especially you, dear. Enjoy. [Alice] I mean, maybe we don't need a DJ. Not to brag, but my Spotify playlist is pretty on point, and I'm particularly proud of Meditative Frog Sounds Volume Two. All those years, I said no to going the club and rubbing up on rappers, and look at me now. What I wouldn't give for Playboy Cardi's number. Wait a minute, wait a minute. We don't have to ingratiate ourselves with a man. We got the Grandma Mafia. -What? -What's Grandma Mafia? We run the town. As matter of fact, I've got a friend who's got a very, very famous grandson. I even think that he won a Grammy. -What's his name? -I don't know. I don't remember. What's his grandma's name? -I don't remember. -What do you remember? I'm the one with dementia, remember? Hold on. Here we go. [mumbling] Lena, Lena. [phone rings] -Lena? -DJ? -Not my Latrell. -Not my grandson. Robert's got two left feet in no sense of rhythm. That's Ruby's grandbaby.

Beyoncé? Oh, one of your friends. Never mind. Seems like I know that name, Beyoncé. -[tires screech] -[loud rap music on stereo] [car horn honking] [stereo switches off] Hey Summer Sizzle people. -[Janice] Looking good, girl. -Thank you, thank you. Morning. Can you keep it between the cones, girl? Chill. We staying right there. -No, you need to keep between the cones. -You keep it between the cones. Oh Lord, please watch over Summer Sizzle. Thank you Jesus. [Keke] Ben. You need to park in the designated spot. Okay, you don't have to be such a smart ass. I'm not. But the fire marshal, she's a smart ass who could shut this down in two seconds. [Janice] Keke, I think you put too many booths here and they're all too small. -That's what I said. -Ben, move the truck. Ben. Don't move. And what is this, Keke? "Holistic medicine for pets"? Keke, you can't just put three words together and then call it a booth. And this stage is too big and it's supposed to be over there. I checked your insurance policy. Because the stage has a full electric package, -the potential fire hazard-- -I don't care about no fire hazard. This is a Sizzle, -not a bonfire. -I know, I know. I know but we can't afford to get shut down. [whimpers] It's the 40th anniversary. It's going to be a mess. [laughing] Dee Nice is here. A little shorter than I thought, -but he's got a cute ass. -Really? -Yes, girl. -I'm shocked he showed up. That's impossible. I'm telling you, Grandma Mafia can come through for some nice D. Can you escort him to the information booth? Yes. I'd be glad to escort him -anywhere, honey. -I'm going with you. No you are not. -You thirsty. -[Janice laughs] -Why you got to come? -You too hungry. [Debra] I'm thirsty, you hungry. Sounds like a meal to me. [Janice] I see what you mean, Debra. You gonna introduce us, Keke? Keke! And you must be theJanice Summers. Grandma said come, and here I am. You're the world-famous DJ? That's right. I'm DJ Dee... Nutz! I like his nuts. Yeah, now my regular gig is like divorce parties or retirement barbecues, staggettes. I love a good staggette. So you're like a DJ Dee Nice cover MC. I thought you had a Grammy. I do have a Grammy. Best grandmother in the world. She books most of my gigs for me. Wait a minute. So who are you? I'm gonna tell you something. You get your ass up on that stage today and I will wrap those fake chains around your ass. I'm going to tell you that -because I am DJ Jan. -[laughs] Oh Gram-jam, such a jokester. -[Janice] I ain't joking. -So sure, if you know, if you're up to it, whoever you are, we're all set up over here. Girl. You heard me straight. He better not mess up my finale. [Dee Nutz] Let's get this party started. -Not bad for a knockoff. -[Dee Nutz] Juneteenth, let's celebrate! I'm gonna go see about these booths here. Okay Gram-jam. [gasps] Wait, no! -[Tasha] Sean! Sean! -[Sean] Yes? -Yes, baby. -[Tasha] Yes, please. I'm on the phone. With Keke's bank. -Okay. -All the money gone. Hi, hi. Yes, the entire account. I want all the money back into her account. -Yes, all of it. -Whoa, whoa. Give me the coffee. You don't need more of that. I don't care if she's over 18. I am her mother and she does not know what to do with that kind of money. -Mm. -Frank, you said Frank, right? Okay, listen, okay? Clearly you don't have kids, 'cause if you did, you'd know that they're all damn fools. -[phone line clicks] -Okay, I-- -[R&amp;B hold music] -That fool put me on hold. -He put me on hold. -I hear. -He put-- -I hear... That... Yeah. [hold music] I mean, at least the music is good, right? That's some-- What are you doing? This ain't big enough, and it's too far from the stage. We are always in booth 31. -It's tradition. -Leave it to me. -I'll fix it. -We have to have the chess tournament here. We need clearance for an emergency vehicle to get past the stage. -Our permit depends on it. -Well, that's crazy. We don't have enough room for our VIP section. How are we supposed to serve our Stock Da Bar vodka? You can't serve vodka here. We don't have a permit for hard liquor. It's only serving if you're selling it. -Yeah, baby. [laughs] -We giving this away. I bet you didn't learn this at Hah-vahd, did you? Go on, taste it. It's free. You in charge? I'm not setting up my fish fry next to some cramped-ass dog adoption booth. Piss and shit smell getting all into my vegetable oil? -Oh hell no. -I agree, Phyllis. -I'll help you. -Janice. You know my name is Dolores. Wait, no, I'll help. I'm Keke. -I don't know you. -[Mildred] What is going on? This is all wrong. Wonky Donkey Dog should be next to Founder's Brewery. Brats and beer? We had it all planned out. Mildred, we want Wonky Donkey Dog to be happy. Do you want some nice D? Janice! What is wrong with you? And what the hell am I in some tiny-ass space? I can barely fit my barbecue rig in that damn stall. I know this is a lot less space than you're used to. But it's gonna be much busier this year, I promise. -Trust me. -I don't trust you. -I don't know you. -[all complaining] -[complaints continue] -We don't have no room... [shouts] Everyone, please! -If I asked DJ Dee Nutz-- -Who the hell is "Deez Nuts"? If I ask him to shout you all out during his set, do you promise to stay in the booths where you were assigned? You know? Free word-of-mouth publicity. Marketing 101. -[Debra] You want to stay? -Okay? -Okay? -Okay. Let me know what you want Dee Nutz to say. Just make sure he hashtags my ass. [hold music] Baby, can I get you something to eat? She's gone too far. I mean, all the money in her account? She just doesn't even care. She's just gonna throw her life away. I'll do something. I won't let her do this. -Over my dead body. -Right. Right. -[hold music] -I mean, it doesn't stop. -[music stops] -Okay, that's it. So, Pastrami on rye? It's from Zingerman's. I could-- Okay, that look says no. -You know what I'm going to do? -I couldn't possibly. I'mma call Crystal Maitland. Don't even try to stop me. That's what needs to happen.

But them ribs, though. Ultimate soul food, am I right? Know what I'm saying? Can I get a witness? Anyway, could I interest you in a free bonnet? It's a sexy little nightcap, but more importantly, it's necessary for you with your Black hair in corporate America. Now this is an extra layer of protection for you. -Against racism. -You know, I have my hands full right now, so I'm good. I've seen a lot of your promotional items at Gram-jam's house. [laughs] But a bonnet... You know, Keke, I don't know how to explain it. It's like, I listen. I listen to what the hood needs, and then I just invest and make it happen.

You know all that cheesy Buddy Frank merch hanging out at Gram-jam's house? She likes free promo stuff. What can you do? Well, she took more than just a free mug. She actually signed some contracts with that guy. What, are you kidding? She got a reverse mortgage. Soon enough, he'll basically own her home.

Yes, As a matter of fact, I was at Second City in Chicago for two years. Well, I was wondering if I could interest you in the acting role of a lifetime. Specifically, improv. Yes, and... That was an improv joke. -[laughs] -Ah-ha. [upbeat music] Go on, let these ladies dance by themselves. I see you, sundress, I see you. It's my favorite time of year. Let's go! That's not a dance, wait a minute. Hold on, bring the music-- I think he needs some medical-- No, that's just how he dances.

You've met my Uncle Jim, right? I know you like to help our elders with investments. I mean, I'm only a woman after all. -What do I know about money? -You were very wise to bring him to me, Keke. I recognize this handsome devil from getting lined up at the House of Style from time to time. Oh yes. How you doing, young blood? Good. Real good, sir. Oh. Keke, this is just the man I wanted to see. He is so good with money. -Money. [laughs] -Keke. We need to talk. Excuse me. -Now, go over here. -[Buddy] So Uncle Jim. [speaking slowly] You happen to own your own home? Yeah, bought my house in 1978. [chuckles] Baby Ruths were ten cents then. But the Detroit Lions still sucked. [both laugh] Well, some things never change, sir. Let me roll you into my office. -I think we can do something. -[Jim] Yes, sir. You use your Vanguard fund to fund a block party? -Keke, a block party. -You went through my computer? Gram-jam gave you that money on your 1st birthday specifically to be used for something special, or at least an emergency. How can you not see that this is both? It's okay. Is this what you're trying to do to me today? Kill me? Huh? You're trying to kill me. My daughter's trying to kill me! Because I sure as hell am about to kill you. Mom, chill. I just fronted the block party until the sponsors pay me back. -If we don't get shut down-- -Oh my God, stop it! Summer Sizzle is a dinosaur. Okay? Let an asteroid hit and let it die already. I can't. This could be Gram-jam's last time on stage. She's been doing it for the past 40 years. At the very least, Gram-jam will be happy. She won't even remember it, Keke. [somber music] She may not be all there, but she's still here. So, what? All that work, the best school in the world, and you just throw our dream job away for a block party? I didn't throw anything away. -I still have my job. -I know you do. I called Crystal Maitland's office and made sure your job was still secure. -What did you do? -I am trying to keep you -from throwing your life away. -What did you do? Keke, just hear me out, okay? I am trying to do what's best for you. What's best for me is for you to stop trying to live my life for me and leave me alone. [music fades] [Keke] I can't believe her. I had everything under control. My mom had to stick her nose in my business. And now I'm not even entirely sure if I still have a job. I haven't even started yet. [Eboni laughing] It's all about control with you, ain't it? Don't you have a food truck to run? First of all, it's a partnership. Second, I gotta have fun too, unlike some people. How many times do I have to say this? I am fun. You know what? I'll prove to you once and for all. Let's go have fun. [upbeat music] [bell clangs] [man 3] Dunk tank is open. Does anybody want to go on in? We have any takers? Anybody want to get wet?

I know you can't lose control. -You won't get in that tank. -No, I can't get my hair wet. Oh yeah. Miss Atlanta. Okay. Hey everybody, I'm next. I'm about to be more fun than all of you. I wouldn't do that if I were you. You might mess up your business look. [Tasha] I cannot believe her. Does she not understand what we went through -to put her through Harvard? -Just because Keke's not doing -exactly what you want her to, doesn't-- -Watch it, Sean. [stutters] I'm just saying, she... She's got a good head on her shoulders. She'll figure it out. Just have a little faith. Yeah. Faith she's gonna waste all her damn money on this block party. Oh, okay. Are you feeling guilty because Keke is stepping up to help out Janice, instead of you? Sean, you know that's not fair. [soft music] You know that my mother never supported me. Never once did she say she was proud of me. No matter what I did, nothing was ever good enough for her. [intense music] Let's spread some joy. [upbeat music] Ouch. You're supposed to hit the red thing. Oh, you've got to try better than that to get me. [laughs] Who's next? Are you sure you want me to do this? I really do. It's just, it's so hot. [sighs] But you're never gonna dunk me in a million years. Yo, three balls, please. Thank you. Thank you. A lot of people want to dunk you. I've been making so much money today. Thank you.

Do you know why I'm here? I know this must look bad. I know this must look bad, and my mother should have never called you. But I'm letting you know that I am the best hire -you will have ever made. -I'm not sure I ever hired you at all. -Excuse me? -After I spoke with your mother this morning, it's clear she's the one who wants this job. You, not so much. Well, well, well. Janice Summers. I want to tell you that I'm shutting you and your Sizzle down. Over my dead, sexy body. What are you talking about? Kiki paid for herself. We got the permits, you said it was all fine. Wait, Keke paid $15K of her own money? -What did she do that for? -[Joy] I play by the rules. Queen of Hearts: Ten Rules for Success. Go read it. Isn't that a Crystal Maitland book? What, you read her stuff? Look, this has gotten out of control. -You expanded too fast. -What are you trying to say? What's your point? Well, unless you have Permit 12043, I'm shutting you down. Keke handles that. Okay, you have one minute to find her. Otherwise I'm gonna shut the whole event down, -starting with the music. -[Eboni] Okay, I'll go get her. You can't shut us down. I haven't been on stage yet.

It's what I've always wanted. -I want this job. -Keke! Joy the fire marshal is going to shut us down, and Gram-jam will have a meltdown if she can't get on stage. Joy keeps asking for a permit. Ten-twenty-three-goober something... Oh my God. Okay. Please, stay here. Just for a couple of seconds. I will be right back, -I promise. -I've seen enough. [man 4] Crystal Maitland! Will you sign this for me please? -Sorry, girl. -I don't want to talk about it. Okay. But I told you that contraption was not made -for Black women. -You said I wasn't fun. I did it to prove you wrong. Girl, that was a metaphor. I'm deep like that. -Thirty-nine. Thirty-eight. -You have just ruined a perfectly good bid whist game. I was winning. -[Joy] Thirty-six. -Twenty. -[Joy] Thirty-- -Forty-five. -Just a sec. No. -Two hundred. Seven. Stop doing that, I-- Where did I leave off? -Forty-nine-- -I'm here. It's here. The permit's here. I can't see. I lost my contacts in the dunk tank. Oh my God. Okay, ladies, dump your purses. Let's find glasses for Keke. I hope it's not in my purse. We'll never find them. What are you doing with-- How old are these rubbers? Just because I can't get knocked up, don't mean I have to get some STD. Honey, my pussy is newer than this condom right here. -[snickers] -[Debra] Fine. What does it say in there? [Keke] Okay, now I can see. Here it is. Okay. What you have here is Permit 12043. -[Keke sighs in relief] -[Joy] What you do not have is the newly required addendum 15A. It gives me no pleasure to do this, but I have to shut you down. Are you kidding me? You're right. It does give me pleasure to do this. -[Debra] Oh my God. -This is now an illegal gathering. I got to call in for backup. -[radio turns on] -Calling all units. Requesting backup at the Summer Sizzle block party, at MLK block. We're shutting it down. Oh my God, It's over. No, wait.

You want to go somewhere and talk about it? Thanks Will, but I just need to be with myself right now. [somber music] [Janice] Well, everyone's going home. So much for my big finale. Cookie? Oh boy, I never heard you say no to a cookie before. Well, what's the matter, baby girl? I lost my job and it was all Mom's fault. But also not her fault.

These are really good. Really is Russian roulette. I just might be the best grandma. But I wasn't the best mom. I tried to be. I thought I did the best I could with Tasha, but I made my mistakes.

You got to follow the rules. I mean, certainly the author of The Ten Rules for Success would know that, am I right? Well, let me understand this. You are shutting down this entire historic Juneteenth celebration over a technicality. Well, this whole event should have been planned better.

You know what it is. [funky music] -[Keke] Can you hold for a sec? -Yeah. [Keke] Thank you. Hey guys. We're interrupting the music briefly, just briefly because I need to make an announcement. We have a special guest in our community, and I want to point him out. Buddy Frank. -Buddy, where are you? -[scattered applause] -Ah! There you are. -Right here. Everyone, take a long, hard, good look at this man. He has been creating financial opportunities here, especially for our elderly. Just trying to serve. Serve whom, exactly? [silence] [Eboni] Give it to him straight, Keke. Buddy Frank is a liar. [crowd murmuring] And he's been preying on the most vulnerable, wreaking havoc on their finances, stealing from our elders who can barely take care of themselves. [Buddy] Whoa, whoa. That's not true. What? I-- [stammers] By the way, you got any proof of that happening? No, you don't. So bye, Felicia. Because like the kids say nowadays, -pics or it didn't happen. -Well, it did happen. And we do have pics. Eboni, you got it. [Buddy] Do you happen to own your own home? -[Jim] Yeah. -What? [Jim] I bought my house in 1978. That is a huge accomplishment, Uncle Jim. -It's Uncle Jim, right? -[chuckles] Well, with all that equity in your property, I'm going to be able to pay you to live there. [Jim] Who are you? [crowd murmuring] You my friend? [Buddy] Jim, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna take care of your paperwork. You just initial here to attest you're of sound mind. And then you sign here to turn your accounts over to me and start building generational wealth for your family. - Am I right? -[crowd murmuring] Know what I'm saying? Can I get a witness? - Sign. -[Jim] Who are you? Yes. That's good. All right. Good. We are good. All right. [crowd chattering] -Grab his ass. -What the hell? Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, wait, wait. There's an explanation for this, okay? She cut that out of context. Come on, y'all. All I do is try to help. I'm woke. [to security] Hey, stop. Guys, watch it. Happy Juneteenth, motherfucker.

I'm a dreamer, but I never dreamed it would be this big. [cheers and applause] Thank you all. And thank you, Keke. [crowd cheers] Well, it's the 40th anniversary of the Summer Sizzle, you know. [all] We know. Well, um... Do you know who was my inspiration for Summer Sizzle? I bet you don't know that. My daughter, Tasha. [applause] [soft music] Juneteenth is a celebration of us coming a long way. However, our world is still not really safe for us always. And Lord knows that the business opportunities have been squeezed left and right. I wanted to create a community for all of us. And maybe selfishly for my daughter. I wanted her to know that even if something happens to me, she would be okay. Take care of each other. ♪♪ Take care of each other, y'all.

Harvard's getting a brand new job. -Don't jinx it, Daryl. -Daryl ain't going to jinx it. That girl got a horseshoe up her ass. It's for the philanthropic arm of my organization. See, I've given a lot to my community. Investing in big businesses, small businesses. But now I want to have a direct impact on causes that I care about.

Oh my God, baby girl, what's going on? -What is it? -So what do you say? I'm going to Atlanta. [all cheer] [Crystal] You'll be here a couple of months because my first order of business was to buy out a certain Buddy Frank. I'm going to need you to take over his development project that he was scheming and turn it around. Make it about local businesses, not about gentrification. Also, I partnered with the Yvonne Mathis Foundation to help people like your grandma get on track financially. So if you take this job, you will build your own team. -Do you think you can do that? -I know I can. We have some really great people here. But I'm going to see you real soon, Miss McQueen. -Thank you. -Y'all enjoy your barbecue. -Yeah, uh-huh. -Yes. I can't believe it. TheCrystal Maitland -was here at our house. -We got the job!
