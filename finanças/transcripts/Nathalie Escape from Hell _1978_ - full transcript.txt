Hello. Hi. I'm sorry to have called you out again. But you see there's a curse in sciatica pains me here when there is so much to be done in the fields. I must be getting old, huh? I was talking to the mayor yesterday. We'd all be starving with all the demands the Germans are making. Have you heard the latest orders? Two thirds of the harvest and the best land has been destroyed by the tanks and the bombs, a real problem. Ah. I don't know what will happen. - You're getting more bitter everyday, aren't you, Zoltan? - I'm also thinking of you, Nathalie Baskova. I often ask myself how you manage to travel all this way in all weathers with a bicycle, always smiling. As you're the only doctor left in this region you need a new motor car. Why don't you apply for one? - Because they need the fuel for the tractors. You must realize that. Besides I like cycling. You seem nervous, Nathalie. Is something worrying you? - No I'm all right it's only that I didn't sleep well last night that's all. - Sit down, why don't you sit down and relax? Those damn Germans again. Von Leb is leaving for Leningrad with six armored divisions and 21 infantry divisions. Now listen lieutenant, here we have one armored column we must push towards the Napier and then occupy Kiev. Bolmunge Stet thought very highly of my plan. Because the Ukraine, Ukraine as you know is the granary supply of Russia. A good plan general but a bit audacious-. But that would mean controlling the whole of the Ukraine with one armored column, the Russians are very attached to their land and they will fight for it inch by inch. - There does exist some resistance on the part of the civilian population but they'll be hunted down even if it means starting a reign of terror. And remember the Filhrer's orders. Anyway there's no organized resistance in these parts. Just a few hot headed partisans. But this is madness. Attacking a German convoy right on top of a village. Sit down. Exterminate all of them! Every single one! Take cover, sir! Stay down! Down! Everything all right? Yes fine. It's over now. It's time I was on my way. I've other patients to see. Bye. Bye. Out of the way. Come on. Put the general on the table. Easy now. What, what does this intrusion mean? What do you want? Silence. General Hartz was shot by some criminals and I'm holding everyone here responsible. ls there a telephone here? No. Is there a doctor? Yes I'm a doctor. I'll attend to him. - Good. I am ordering you here and now to save the general's life or you'll pay with your own. I don't give a damn for your orders. My obligation as a doctor forces me to tend to this man's wound, whoever he is. I'll try to save his life but I can promise nothing. You, corporal Hind. Stay here and guard the general. And you follow me, we must find a telephone. Give me a hand. Get me something he can sit on, quick. Here. You'll find bandages in my bag. Quickly, Zoltan, boil up that water and give me some more. Welcome back, how did it go? - Pretty well, we went a little further this time. Well that's okay. I see that we lost some men. But the important thing is that the mission was accomplished but listen, tell me, did you kill the general? - He got away, the grenade only managed to injure him. His men took him away to Zoltan's farm. We had no choice. Well he's got to die. Hartz is chief advisor to Von Runstead. His death would halt the offensive. It's impossible. The farm house is full of Germans. We've got too. I know the place well, going through the granary you get to the attics where there's a stairway to the kitchen. We have precise orders. Nathalie Baskova risked her life last night bringing up the message received on her radio. It's top priority. Some one must go back. It's a job for one man. A group would be discovered. So I'll see you. Get back to the wall, both of you! Hurry up! No, no Basili. Please don't. Ah. Get that man! You refuse to disclose the names of those responsible for the attack? Well what do you want me to do about it? I know nothing of those men. Please listen to me, Captain. This old man is under my care and I can assure you of his incapacity to leave this house. He's very ill. - The general is dead, murdered by your people. All the inhabitants of this village will be deported to Germany. - Listen, deportation doesn't frighten me at all. But please think, captain, if you send me away who will look after the sick? Hmm, well who's ill? That man? No! No! Go on, take her away. Come on, do it now. On the line, now! More Russian women, eh? And as usual ugly or pregnant. I ask for workers and they sent me rubbish. I suppose it would be asking to much to know if any of you have any special skills. Do you know anything, about machines? As I thought. What do you do? I work mechanical laves. Works of three. And you? What can you do? I can feed swine. - Otto give this slut a shower, she stinks. And give her strokes of the whip. Take her away, go on. Dirty swine! And you? I'm a doctor. Very good, you'll go to the infirmary. The others to be put in the barrack 15. Work will be assigned to them tomorrow. And get them all all a shower, they smell like goats. - Something to eat, finally something to eat. First time all day. Quick, quick. Come on, more, more. Maybe we can take it ourselves. Give us a kiss first. Come on drink it up. This'll do you good. Come on drink it up. Don't tell me you compete, compete to go to bed with those swine. It's degrading. Sometimes but not for their blue eyes. They've got heated rooms you see. Here we shiver day and night. - You'll notice MacDonald the secret is to bring the whiskey to the right temperature. Then you must pour the cream, very carefully like that. It will be ready in a moment. Mmm, the sorry Mortimer my dear chap, believe me there's no comparison. This is drinkable but real Irish coffee should be made with a moss whiskey not this dreadful blended stuff. And anyway the coffee should be exactly, you know, the same temperature as the whiskey. You just try it. To England and your great man Churchill. - To Scotland and our brave allies the Russians. And an early victory. Yes that's quite acceptable Mortimer. My compliments really. That's quite a good imitation of our coffee. - Are you sure you won't have some, Basili? Thanks but I don't drink. And I don't smoke anymore. Sorry I have to get down to business but my plane leaves at three hours. Military intelligence has required my immediate return to Russia. We have a little problem, Basili. Seeing as you coordinate agents movements on the eastern front. One of our agents Ingrid Wasering must have fallen into a trap, we've lost all contact. - Even if the description was circulated to my men it will be almost impossible to find her. Not this time. We too know our job and we've managed to pin point an area. However we find that it's in a sector of Germany where we have no available agents. Tell me where is it? We're but 90% sure she's a prisoner at the fortress at Steelberg on the Polish border. - You're wrong, MacDonald, it is not a fortress but simply a chateau near the Polish border, built by a french architect. It's extremely well guarded because in there they have the most powerful transmitter which relays all the orders of General Von Leb to Berlin. Oh, another piece of information, post name horse five division of infantry whose officers go out to Steelberg and amuse themselves. Your fortress is nothing but a luxury brothel. Well I find that rather surprising. - Basili, do you think you could infiltrate one of your agents into this brothel? - You mean you want me to turn one of my agents into a tart? Meh. Your England has vital information. Am I right there? Mm-hmm. Yes Basili, you're quite right. She's into the organization that's plotting and fighting for Hitler's downfall. If she's caught, the plot will fail and we'll lose two years besides of our best men. You understand? And little Ingrid, either she gets out of Steelberg or, I think I may have the solution. As you can see, we are doing our best to treat the prisoners humanely. For instance their rations allow for meat three times a week, which is not too bad. Very good. And for medical attention and the ill? Any risk of epidemics? Well, we are very well organized here. We have a German doctor and also Russian doctor working together with us. Here she is, Miss Baskova. Well, now Miss Baskova, will you kindly show this gentleman around he's here on inspection for the Swiss Red Cross. I'd be happy to do so. - I want to check all the equipment at your area doctor. Are there any sick? About 30. Uh-huh. And two in isolation. Contagious? Yes, very. I'd advise you not to visit that ward, it's to risky. - Even so we forget we have a duty to preform. Are you coming? No, I think I better stay here. Thank you. Now are there anymore questions? And about hygiene? - I think that you can ask the prisoners about that. Feel free to ask whatever questions you like. When you entered the secret service you swore you'd obey any orders. Even at the risk of your own life. That's an order, Nathalie Baskova. You've been chosen for this mission because you're a doctor. You must free Ingrid Wasering or kill her. Have you heard the news? We're leaving tomorrow, it's official. They're taking us to Steelberg. Isn't it wonderful? - Staying here or going else where, it's all the same. It's bound to be cleaner. What do you want? - Oh nothing, but why did you make such a fuss refusing the attentions of that Nazi? You see you won't be invited to Steelberg. You don't want to stay here, do you? It's miserable here. Everyone's going, I'm going too. - So you say but you could be sent to a concentration camp. - Let's just say I'm coming with you so as not to be lonely. But the others are jealous of you. I don't know why, but I'm happy you're coming too. Go on, go to bed. Goodnight. Come with me. Who is there? I asked on no account to be disturbed. - It's Muller sir, I must talk to you. Come in, Muller. Well, Muller? - Among the prisoners that have just come from Lupin there's also a doctor, Colonel. I felt that she might be more useful in her capacity as doctor than as hostess. Excellent idea. That way we could have someone on hand when one of our hostesses tries to commit suicide. I suppose Frau Hortz is aware of all this? I didn't consult her, sir. - You should have asked her before coming here. Helga is responsible for our female personnel here at Steelberg, Muller. For the auxiliary personnel, yes. But you're in command here, Colonel Gunter. - You better prepare a lot of acceptance for that woman. And bring her to me for signature. I suggest you find her a place in the infirmary. Explain the regulations to her. Carry on, lieutenant. - Naturally, I suppose it didn't occur to you to check against the list, Sergeant? A girl is missing. Go and find Muller. Tell him he has to meet me in the parade room. I've something to tell him. Colonel, this is Miss Baskova. - As the young lady can't furnish proof of her being a doctor, I shall check her competence immediately. You may go now, Muller. I have a pain here, on this side which never stops. - If you really want an examination of yourself and a diagnosis, Colonel, I want my instruments back. My medical bag was confiscated the day I left Lubin. - In case no one taught you discipline at Lubin, well then I'll teach it to you. Each one of you is to give me a daily report of everything you see and hear in your group. Do I make myself clear? I want to know all that happens. Don't hide anything. You will all be watched. I've finished, get going. Come in. Ah the elusive Muller. - I understand you asked to see me, Frau Hortz. Uh-huh. Do you really need a whole day to obey my orders, Muller? I requested your presence this morning. It's now six o'clock. I only received your message just now. General Von Runstead invited me to lunch at headquarters. If only I'd known. Oh, he asked me to give you his best wishes and a personal message. What is it? - The general asked me to tell you that the day after tomorrow some officers will be returning from the front and he'd like you to put on one of your special parties for six men. Please inform the general that it shall be done as he wishes. Why are you always so disagreeable with me, Erik? One might say you were perpetually trying to avoid me. - I'll take your reply to the general immediately. Reply to me first. This morning you usurped my authority and took away one of the new arrivals. Who and what for? Read that. It's the order confirming that Nathalie Baskova has been assigned as doctor of Steelberg. Perhaps you'd like to see her? I have her outside. - I believe you think far too much, lieutenant. The confirmation has been counter signed by General Von Runstead, I can only suppose you have good reason to protect this person. - Nothing personal, I simply thought it my duty to inform my commander of the presence here of a doctor, that's all. - I find your explanation very offensive, lieutenant. Tell her to come in. Muller, there is a point you seem to have missed. The term medical auxiliary which means doctor, so your Nathalie Baskova remains under my responsibility. Now tell her to come in. Gunter speaking. What is it? Oh good evening, it's Helga speaking. Excuse me. But I simply wanted to know if the Dr. Baskova could have the room next to the infirmary? It would be more practical for her. - Don't bother me with such stupid details. You decide. Yes. - You handle these things better than me. It's all arranged, my dear. I feel I can trust you. I wouldn't want to put you in with all those sluts. A word of advice now, never go out of the castle, the guards have orders to shoot on sight anyone suspect. Are there other prisoners here? Awhile ago, I saw some soldiers carrying handcuffs. Forget it. There are a few rebellious girls here in isolation in the cellars, but you mustn't be afraid. As long as you respect all of the rules and follow my advice, you will see that life here in Steelberg is not so bad after all. I am sure we are going to get along very well together. Come on, have a drink. Oh go on. Give me a sip. It's good, just as you. You silly boy. Hey Eddie, get the girl, get a girl. You must be fooling, me with a girl. Did you hear him? Come on give me some. Oh come on, I like that. It's good stuff. That's an order, Nathalie Baskova. You were chosen for this mission because you're a doctor. You must free Ingrid Wasering or kill her. Free her or kill her. Free her or kill her. It's you. What are you doing here? - I'm lost, I was looking for Colonel Gunter in his office but he wasn't to be found there. I wanted to check his blood pressure. The state of his health worries me. Yeah, it worries me too. I hope you can manage to convince him to stop drinking that is. But I expect you can see him in the morning, can't you? - Well I'd better get back to the infirmary. - Don't rush away you know it's not safe wandering around all alone here. You'd be in hot water if you were found on the third floor. Particularly as the infirmary is on the ground floor of the chateau. I'm sorry. Ah I'd almost forgotten headquarters have returned your medical equipment. Where can I find it? In my office. Thank you. Tell me about Nathalie. Do you know her well? No, not at all. I know that she's a doctor, that's all. For the rest? She prefers her own company. Tell me what about men? - Oh la la, she won't let any man near her. I remember a Sergeant tried at Lubin, he got a slap in the face for his attempts. Well then what do you suppose her little game is here with us? Who cares? But why talk about her? I choose you tonight but I don't believe I permit insolence. And now to the right. What's that noise? It's nothing that concerns you. It's just a simple transmitter but I'd advise you not to snoop around here. You'd need a special pass. Another one? I'd never find myself in all these forbidden passages, excuse me, Frau Hortz, but I've absolutely no sense of direction, it's a good thing I'm not a surgeon. You may lack a sense of direction but you've a delicious sense of humor. All these girls are looking very well this morning. Now with which one am I going to amuse myself this time? Let's see. Elizabeth. You Gertrude? Or you Marcel. Or with you, the insolent Ingrid. It's a very difficult decision, isn't it? Well you see, my dear Nathalie, as this is the first time you've come here, you have the right to a favor. Choose from amongst them. Don't be afraid, they'll get their due. - But, but what have they done to be treated like animals? Well Elizabeth here for example, tried to organize the escape of some prisoners. Gertrude here is an insolent, lying little slut. No! And Marcel insulted me. Ingrid however, is a special case. A talented prostitute, the greatest in Munich she's really famous, a true champion guaranteeing total satisfaction, you know I offer her to my more demanding and exacting guest. And you know what she did? The dirty, filthy, little Jewess. Happily however one of the arrivals recognized her and told me all about her. Well then, which one have you chosen? Very well. Guards. No, no! Not me! No! For pity's sake no! No, No. - Don't you find that all this is very amusing? No I don't! I find it revolting! You're much to delicate by far. Hang on, Owful. Guess who's come to visit? A little friend who wants to caress you. - Listen, I have the authorization to come here, to come here and examine the prisoners. I was ordered by Colonel Gunter. These prisoners are top secret. You need an order signed by Frau Hortz and not by Colonel Gunter. Do I make myself clear? And unless you want to join the prisoners permanently, I advise you never to come here without a pass signed by Frau Hortz. I said I oppose it! It's not only because that lieutenant Muller has taken that Dr. Baskova under his protection. Those were my instructions, Frau Hortz! Ha! - I've had enough of your perpetual insinuations. Lieutenant Muller is an excellent officer. He doesn't seem at home here at all. Happily I heard he's applied for a transfer to the front line. Yes, but I know his motives. And I refused it. On the contrary it's your transfer to Berlin that I'm applying for and tomorrow. Without the shadow of a valid reason! I'm the only one to maintain a semblance of discipline in here. - Well just start by carrying out my orders, Frau Hortz. And as to a reason I've a good one, all the girls hate you. And one of these days there will be a mutiny. You're not alone. I too have friends in Berlin. And I'm advising you just don't ever forget it. Shakespeare. That's Shakespeare, Frau Hortz. Do you know anything about Shakespeare, Frau Hortz? No of course not. I don't suppose your friends in Berlin have any knowledge of Shakespeare either. Hmph. Good day, Frau Hortz. - Good morning, Erik, I imagine you must have received my invitation for this evening. - Yes I did but unfortunately I shall be busy this evening. As I proposed myself as guard duty officer tonight. You made a mistake. Your precious protege will be there though and General Gross will also be there. She'll like that. But you're not going to like what I've got to tell him. - I can't think what you're talking about. Really? Those two large sealed sacks secretly taken to the incinerators and burnt with the rest of the rubbish might interest General Gross quite a lot. Accidents doubtless but these girls are- That's enough. No one could care less about those whores except you, lieutenant, an attitude that could cost you dear. You don't frighten me, Frau Hortz. I've asked headquarters for an immediate transfer to the eastern front. A piece of advice, keep right out of my way. Again, cough again. Breath in. What is the matter? You're all right. I can't find a thing wrong. Perhaps you've just been overdoing things. - No Nathalie, I'm afraid my problem is to be found there. I'm sorry, Frau Hortz. I can only prescribe a good dose of bromide. But you'll see that after a good night's sleep you'll feel much better. You're obviously extremely tired. Thank you. Now I can see that you really couldn't give a damn about my physical needs. That's not true at all but my skills veer towards the medical, Frau Hortz. Very well. As I can't rely on your personal collaboration it seems, well we'd better forget medicine. I've organized a reception for General Gross this evening and I'm counting absolutely on your presence. My guests sit down to table at 10. In these clothes? No I couldn't possibly. Thanks but no. I'll just stay in the infirmary, that's my place. - Nathalie I'll find the right dress for you. - Please don't, I just don't feel like going. But I demand that you do! That's an order. Do you see? You will appear this evening hair done, made up in the main dining room at exactly 10 o'clock. Is that clear? A toast to our dear General Gross. Come here, give me a kiss. - You know my dear General my one wish is that you would come here without the excuse of battle fatigue. If I didn't it would follow me. Then that silly idiot raised her hand so I spitted her like a chicken. Gentlemen please listen to me. It would be a pity to leave to chance such an important decision as who you're going to spend the night with, don't you agree? So to finish this agreeable evening, with your permission, dear General, of course. Naturally. Well then, a little fun. I suggest that each girl in turn be the stake in a game of cards. Bravo! Naturally the winner having the right to do as he wishes with his prize. Is that all right? Naturally. Let's see now. As the first stake. Yes I propose Nathalie. Good. She must account What's going on here? I don't know, sir. I heard a thud from this room. I came in and found him lying here. So I called the guard at once. His pulse is extremely weak. Hold his head up but don't move him. I'll be right back. Very well, sir. Well good luck to the winner. What is it, Muller? Please excuse the interruption, General. - On the contrary, my boy, come and have a drink. - But of course, lieutenant, come and have a drink. We must all drink a toast to the fortune of Colonel Von Speigle, he has just won an entire night with Nathalie. You must excuse me, Colonel, but I must take Nathalie away. Colonel Gunter needs her. Can you come? Just a minute, lieutenant, I won her and I intend to enjoy her. Take someone else. I don't think you understand, Colonel. It's in her capacity as a doctor she's needed. With your permission, sir. - No, no, Von Spiegle forget about it, don't worry. Calm down, there that's the way to behave, we'll get you another girl. There sit down. Feeling better? Now on with the game, the next prize to be won will be Lotta. How is he? Well, his pulse is more regular. Could you get his medical chart? He'll need a cardio tonic and probably he'll need a transfusion. There's too much alcohol in his blood. Right. Is that the infirmary? Muller here. I'm in the Colonel's office. Would you please send over his medical chart at once? Do you need anything else? Yes, a stretcher so he can be carried. Anything else? Yes, a stretcher so he can be carried. I think it would be better if you would put him in my room tonight, it'll be easier for me to keep an eye on him. All right. Muller. I suppose the Colonel's drunk? Nathalie, when you've put him to bed in his room you'll kindly return to the party. It's useless to try wakening a drunk. - No, Miss Baskova, you will kindly stay in your room and take care of the Colonel until you receive further orders. Hmph. You'll pay for this, Muller. - There's an ill man in that room, Frau Hortz, and I think you might have the decency to lower your voice and go away. Hello there. Come to me. Come on, darling. No let me go! Let me go! Colonel! Since when have German officers taken advantage of women against their will? - Keep your nose out of my business, lieutenant. Shut up, drunkard. Come, come on. You all right? Yes, oh but you're wounded. - Don't worry it's just a scratch, nothing serious. Oh, Erik. It's stopped bleeding now. You don't need a bandage. Good night, lieutenant and thank you for doing what you did. - Darling. - Wait. Did you hear something? No, nothing. Hmm. Why are you leaving so early? Early? Do you know the time? I've been here for hours. Oh Erik, I must go. If I don't leave you now, I'll never leave. Guards, sound the alarm! The Colonel's been killed! Guards, hurry up! Come here! The Colonel's been killed! Guards, all in here come on! Guards, the Colonel's been killed! Guards, come here! Oh come here! Guards! Arrest her! I saw her push him down the stairs! No I didn't! Arrest her! Sound the alarm! Arrest that woman! Guards! No it's not true! Guards, arrest her! No, it's not true I swear it! She killed the Colonel! - No, no I've done nothing, please let me go. Put her in the dungeon. No, no. She has killed Colonel Gunter. No, no, no! Let me go please! No, no! Let me go, let me go! Take her away! What the hell's going on? Why have you arrested her? For murder, Muller. Nathalie Baskova murdered Colonel Gunter. That's impossible she was- - Oh I know, Erik, she was on the stairs behind Gunter and she took her opportunity. I'm counting on you to send someone to remove the body of that drunken swine. Goodnight, lieutenant. What's your name? Nathalie Baskova. And you? Ingrid. What's the matter? Nothing, excuse me. I'm not so sure as to where I am. - What did you do to get thrown into this hole? Did you upset the sadist upstairs? - They're saying that I'm the murderer of Colonel Gunter. - If you would make a little effort, I'm sure that we would be able to collaborate together, lieutenant. Ah, you haven't heard the latest news's yet. General Von Ru nstead has insisted that I assume provisionally the full command here at Steelberg. On awaiting official confirmation of my appointment. Aren't you going to congratulate me, Erik? Oh I've no doubt you'll always get just what you want, Helga. - Heavens, what makes you use my name today? You want me to do you some sort of favor? I fear that term is incorrect, it's rather clarification I want. What are you doing? Have you gone mad, Erik? - You hated two people at Steelberg, everybody knows. But how did you manage to eliminate both of them at one blow? Let me go! Your passion for that little Russian whore with whom you slept has completely warped your judgment. - Last night I heard noises from the corridor, as though someone was spying on me. It was you, I now know who pushed Gunter. It was you who killed Gunter. - Don't ever repeat that accusation again, Muller! It's unworthy. A German officer trying to pin a crime on another German officer in order to protect an enemy of the great Third Reich. - Frau Hortz, if one of us is dishonoring the uniform of the Third Reich it is you. German's of your type are giving the world ample reason for hating us. For the very last time, be careful! - I'm warning you, Frau Hortz, that with all my strength I'm gonna try and stop you murdering that woman. Enemy or not, you know that Nathalie Baskova is innocent. Your story doesn't hold water. It's useless to keep on trying. Go back and see your Helga and tell him- Just a minute, you're wrong. I was given a message for you, a phrase by Guter. Oh yes, one's duty is to bring to an end what is offered everyday. Yes I know how it goes. Why didn't you tell me before? I'm Ingrid Wasering. You can't imagine what the Germans would give to know who I am. It's been three months I've been tortured. So long. - My false papers didn't stand up to examination. And what are they doing in London? Do you think they'll help me escape. Oh yes, after losing contact with you they became very worried. Everything depended on your courage. - This Wasering affair is beginning to worry me. I'll tell you why. Three of our agents who had been in contact with her have been arrested on the face of it no connection but somehow I think there's a tie up. - I think you're being to suspicious, Mortimer. Perhaps, perhaps I am. But I work on this principal, should there be a mishap in the system that could be a chance, two a coincidence but three means someone has betrayed the setup. Well I'm here to inform you that I've secreted someone into Steelberg. Do you have news of England? No, I'm in the dark like you. But the situation is getting better. The front is nearing Steelberg and this is what we have decided, one of the police chiefs, Evan, knows this Ingrid well. Have you any idea of the contacts we should use in this area? Should we manage to escape we'd need a safe house. Shh. - That's an order, Nathatlie Baskova. Rescue Ingrid Wasering. Rescue Ingrid Wasering. Or kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. That's enough. The game's up, my dear. I'd hoped you'd given me some useful information but I see London prefers more direct methods. What do you mean by that? Who are you? I'm an agent of the German espionage. Before she died, we made Ingrid talk. Your network was blown more than three weeks ago. We were pretty sure someone would try and rescue her. Now you'd better talk if you want to avoid unnecessary suffering. I'll never talk. That's what they all say. You must stop at once! You won't get anything out of her that way, you'll just kill her. - If you have a better idea, I'll leave it to you. But something just occurred to me. Muller. I was just speaking to the General on the telephone. Nathalie Baskova will be sentenced tomorrow morning at nine. The sentence has already been decided. But we would like to act legally. So we'll need to find a defense lawyer. Are you listening to me? Yes of course. I was thinking, yes to be sure, I'll take care of it. I knew I could count on you. Goodnight, Muller. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler. I wish to talk to the prisoner alone in private, Corporal. I'm her defense lawyer. My orders are not to let anyone in. - Very well, in that case I'll take the responsibility. Very well, lieutenant. Nathalie, oh Nathalie. Oh, Erik. - Nathalie, now listen carefully I want to help you. Tomorrow you'll be tried and you're going to be condemned so listen carefully I don't have much time. I can't let them kill you even if you are a spy. I can't forget you saved my life. Now listen to me, follow my instructions exactly. Please promise me that. I'm going to help you escape, it's the only way out. I've a plan. - I too would very much like to hear your plan, lieutenant Muller. We heard every word you said. Useless denying it. I am accusing you, Muller, of high treason. Consider yourself under arrest. Now boys, you all know what to do. You're not to use firearms before you've neutralized the sentries. - Right lads, get aboard the truck and let's be on our way. Come on, jump to it. Oh have pity on him. And now it's your turn for some fun. Yes, now imagine if I put the lighted end in your little eye. Would you cry? You would, wouldn't you? And I'd softly burn these little lips. Muller, if you want to save her I've a proposition to offer you. I want us to make love together under Nathalie's very eyes. If I'm properly satisfied, well, I'll ask for her pardon. No, Erik. Come over here. I prefer that she didn't hear what I have to say to you. My dear Helga, for a long time now you've filled me with repugnance. I'd rather die than make love to you. The only feeling I can have for you is one of hate. Shut up! Otherwise, I give her the full works! Don't listen to her, Erik. I'm not afraid of her. Muller, I be kind. I'm going to let you spend your last night together just like a pair of turtle doves. Goodnight Muller, goodnight. Evan, Evan. Are you all right, Nathalie? Don't worry about me but how did you manage to get in? I'll explain all that later on. Who's this fella? Muller, he helped me. Good, let's be off. - No we can't go without warning London first. But I found a powerful transmitter upstairs. That would be madness, Nathalie. Every minute counts. - But for all those agents who are parachuting into German traps everyday every minute counts! We don't have time. We must make time! - Evan we've just blown up the guard house. Well done. Come on, let's go. Goodbye, Erik. This is where we part. No Nathalie, I've come to a decision never to leave you. Come on. Are you receiving me? I repeat, all operations in this sector must be suspended. Hurry up, Von will counter attack and we'll never get through the others. - I have to repeat the message for security reasons. Hello, London- Ah ha! Is she dead? Yes. - Thank God she missed us, but she got the transmitter. It's completely broken. Come on, let's get out of here. Quick, quick, make for the woods. Where's Nathalie? Come! Quick, make for the woods! No, Erik no. It's much better like this, you'll see. Oh Erik! Oh no Erik. No Erik, no Erik. No, Erik. - Come on, Nathalie, we have to get cover in the woods. No, no. Come on. No, no, no, no.
