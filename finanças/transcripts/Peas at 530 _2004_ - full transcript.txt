Peas at 5l.3O Now, l chase you like mad in a circle... through bushes... woods and thickets. Soon, l shall turn into a wild boar... then a horse... then a dog... a headless bear and a fire full of fuy. l thank you, moon... for your beautiful... rays of sun... that paint the globe so bright and beautiful. What's the matter? Come on, it was really good. Yes, it was. l don't know either. Nina, please come with me. What is it? Come with me. We'll pick it up... later. Hello. ls someone there? Jakob. It's me... Nina. You're in the hospital. You had an accident. Alright. Done? Yup. Excuse me, you've got a visitor. l'll come get you later. Thanks. Hello, Mr. Magnusson. l'm Lilly Walter from the rehabilitation centre for the blind. Here, take my hand. How do you feel? We'd like to invite you to visit our centre. You have lots to learnl. reading, writing, eating, getting dressed. l know how hard this must be for you as a theatre director. You work with images. l've seen one of your plays. l don't feel like talking. l know. But you're going to need help. l don't want to talk to you. You still there? You'll learn how to tell... at the rehab centre. Welfare will pay for eveything. Should l continue? Sure. Here? Now? No, later on. l want to show you something first. Let's go. l've got your jacket. Take my arm. Careful of the steps. -l know. Here's the dining area... and the leather chair is right behind it. You know, the comfy one. The staircase runs alongside it. The markings in the floor tell you where it starts. And where's the bedroom? Up here. lt's big. And what about the music? Up the stairs... Careful, there's a beam down there. Turn left. Drums. Oh, Paul. Hello, Jakob. lt's me, Nina. l can recognise your voice. You don't have to tell me who you are. Hello, Jan. Come in. Wait, let me do that. l didn't plan to sweep it up. Can l... Do you want something to drink? No. Your mother phoned. Did you tell her? No, l wasn't sure if l should. l'm leaving. l didn't know you were still there. Bye. l told her you'd call back. ls it alright? Yes... l think it's fine. What do you mean 'think'? lt's good. We're keeping it. Let's see it with the 12 kilowatt back light. They're doing it now. Well? ls it alright? Uhh, yeah. l think so. Jan, don't keep saying you think. Either it's good or it isn't. l'm not a director, Jakob. Obviously. ''Young director Jakob Magnusson has resumed work... on A Midsummer Night's Dream...'' ''despite having been blinded in a car accident...'' ''his new Shakespeare staging is scheduled to debut this Friday.'' ''Magnusson, originally from Iceland, came to Germany at a young age with his parents...'' ''and discovered his love for the theatre.'' He's doing it. l got us tickets. A blind director. l don't buy it. l thought it'd be fun. Great idea, Paul. Thanks. l'm going too. Can't you leave the two of them alone for a change? Who's better at describing thingsl. me or me? Paul. Listen,... l want her to come. The director's about to get on stage. Reap your laurels. He's not going to do it. Please. l can piss on my own. l know. Then why are you following me? ln case you need help. l can learn how to help you. You don't need to. What do you mean? You want to split up? Yes. Why don't we at least ty? You wouldn't leave a blind man. You'd never do it. But... l can. l can leave you. Now, leave. Jesus. l guess being blind has its advantages. Don't do that. This place is a sty. -Stop it for God's sake. Hello, mamma. Howare you? Fine. l'm fine. Just fine. Oh, who am l kidding... l'm feeling really bad. l'm back home. Home? But if you're not feeling good... l'm not feeli'ng good because l was in the hospital too long. Hospitals make you sick. That's why they're full of sick people. Are you still there? l've got to take mypi'lls now, l on/y take them ,,, so the nurse doesn't feelgui'lty, l do it for her not for me. They don't work anyway. How's your garden? Getting fuller by the day. Well, that's the last of them. How are you? When will l see you? Jakob, are you still there? Yes,... l'm fine. lt's ni'ce to hearyour voi'ce, l'll call again soon. Bye. l hope you... Bye now. Jan...? l'm leaving, Jakob. Fine. Hi, this is Jakob. May l speak to my mother, please? l tri'edphoni'ngyou, Sory. l'm not at home. Your mother is not well, She's vey ill.

Just come. l'm Lilly Walter from the rehabilitation centre for the blind. l approached you... about joining us. You never give up, do you? No. lf you want to get out of here you'll have to convince the staff... that you'll make no furrther suicide attempts. And that means agreeing to be rehabilitated. Otherwise, you're stuck here. Okay. l'll take you straight to the centre for the blind. Right now? Do you have other plans? Why have we stopped? -Traffic jam. Where are we? At the station. Jakob, don't. What in hell are you up to, young man? Take me to the station. Come with me. Shitty weather today, isn't it? Type of marrten... 12 letters. S-T-R-l-P-E-D S-K-U-N-K Sir remove your paw... from my crossword. Pardon me. Going somewhere? You were released on the condition that you starrt classes immediately. l am personally responsible for you. Do you mind telling me where you think you're going? You can't even take the train on your own. You don't know how to use a cane yet. You can't dress yourself. You can't read or write. Stop it. Don't. Hello? Is anybody there? You stupid, blind asshole. Oh no. Not again. Where do you think you are? Can you hear people? Luggage trolleys? Anything at all? There's no station here. There is nothing here. There is. You. You're always around. Alright. l'm going to ring for help. Shit. What? l don't know where we are. Use your eyes. l can't. Why not? l'm blind. You're blind? Yeah, l was born blind. Shit... A blind woman. Then tell me... what we're going to do now? You're the one who got off the train. That's right. What are you doing? -l'm following the tracks. Tracks lead to stations. Oh God. l didn't ask you to come along. What in hell... is wrong with you? -Listen up. lf you want to help me, give me back my sight. l'll go with you... do all your exercises... use the cane. l'll do it all. Anything you want. Just give me back my sight. l used to see. You have never seen anything. Ever. You can't miss what you've never eXperienced. l don't even know you. Who are you? What do you look like? l am pretty. -Uh huh. How can you be so sure? Eveybody says so. Maybe people lie to you. No. They wouldn't do that. Oh no. Leave me alone. Go away. Shit. Help... Help me. Help. Maybe now you'd like to tell me where you're going. To my mother. And where eXactly is that? Near Onega. And where is that? Archangelsk. On the White Sea in Russia. We'll be there in no time. l thought we had to go to Canada for a minute. You've got quite a sense of humour on you. You'll never make it there. Perhaps. l'm not taking you. l'll believe that when l see it. What's that noise? -Sheep. Haven't you ever seen sheep before? -Nope. She hasn't. Excuse me. Could you please tell us where we are? Klein-Zastrow. And where is that eXactly? Near Greifswald. You're lost, aren't you? l've got a room for you. Or two if you want. lt's the best guest house in the village. Ty calling her. This is the 'front desk'. We have 28 rooms total. l'll go get your room ready for you. Paul, l was just about to call you. Where are you? Come and get her, Paul. She is blind. She can't cope on her own. Who's that with you? Jakob Magnusson, You know, the theatre director. What? l'm not a director any more. What's goi'ng on? l'll eXplain later. Just tell me where you are. Near Grei'fswald, But you don't need to come get me. Ofcourse he does, rhe bli'nd can't go wandering off... on thei'rown, Where is she? l'll take the bus back tomorrow. There are no more today. -Where are you sleepi'ng? ls someone else there wi'thyou? -Yes. A vey nice guest house. Paul, really, don't wory. You can't stay at any old place. You just can't. Paul will come and pick you up. Mom, l'll be alright. Really. l've got to hang up now. See you tomorrow, okay? Bye. Don't keep interrupting. My dear Madam,... l don't tolerate eavesdropping. You aren't really blind. Are you? That's right. Hello, mamma, l'm coming to see you. You're coming. That's nice. Promise not to die before l get there. Wi'll i't take awhi'le? No. l'll ty my best. Good. l'm on my way. l'll take you as far as the fery. And what makes you think l'll let you? Here's yours... and yours. Excuse me, could you please tell us how the food is arranged? Pardon? Pretend the plate is a clock... where would the food be? Let's see... The potatoes are at three o'clock... more like ten to three. Peas... at six o'clock... let's say twenty past six. Hold on... twenty, twenty-five... after six, to six, past five. Sory. l think she can't tell time. Come again? Rita. Could you come here, please? Peas at 5l.30. Yes. Alex, we're going now. You'll clean up, won't you? See you this evening. There are these two broads. You've never seen anything like them. Are they up to anything special? Bodies like theirs are special enough. They can just be. The first one... is built like a brick shit house. And without a bra. And the other one... she's perched on a bar stool. And l can see her drawers. Sheer. Get out. l'm serious. -You're not. Christ, l can't take anymore. What is it? Now, she's spreading her legs... giving me a better view. Hot damn. And l can't see it. How can it be that l'll... never see again. No more legs. Gone forever. Ankles too. l can't get over it. And how am l supposed to meet women? l'll never have another again. Ever. But if l were to how would l know if l really liked her? How would l know? And let's say l do know... what good does it do me? l mean... what's the use? Thanks. You're a real pal. Ah, that's good. Whatare you doi'ng here? Cut i't out, Go away, You're i'n mybed, rhat's ni'ce, Stay, please, l'm not that easy, Don'tbother telli'ng me what you look like. rhat's enough, l'm getti'ng out ofhere, fuck,,, This is so fucked up. We've got to go. What? We've got to go. The bus. Hury up. You can't just waltz in here like that. l'm not even dressed. Too late. Don't the blind have a right to privacy? The bus will probably have a handicapped section... you can have all to yourself. -You're a riot. A regular comedian. Where's my other shoe? Blind people should mind their belongings. That's the first thing... l tell my students. Spare me your lectures. Have you found it? -Yes. Positive? No. There goes the bus. No, that's the bus. Hey, tired of living? Yes. l am. Climb aboard. Who is Paul? My boyfriend. So what's it like being with Paul? Good. What made you fall in love with Paul? He has a beautiful voice. A singer. -No. He restores vintage cars. And when's the wedding? As soon as the house is finished. Paul is building a house. That's nice. First a house, then a wedding... then children. Eveything in its place. Cut it out already. rhen nothi'ng can stand i'n i'ts way, Rhi'nos mate ,,, forabout 30 mi'nutes, Perhaps that is where the rhinoceros powder got its starrt... as a popularaphrodisiac formen suffering from impotence. As we can see giant land turrtles wed 'in April. lt's notalways a case of requited love. She may not even be 15yet ,,, the age at whi'ch giant land turrtles reach maturity. Hello, Alex. Ben. What are you doing here? l didn't think you'd be at home. Stop stammering... and get in here. Let's cut to the chase. You've got a crush on me. lt's obvious. You haven't been with a girl yet, l haven't been... A word of this to anyone and you're dead. l propose that we enter into a mutually beneficial agreement. lt's perfect. My family's miles away at present. A mutually beneficial agreement? A mutually beneficial sexual agreement. Shit. Hi'Alex, It's mom, Have you heard from Lilly? -Yes, she called, Did she say where she was? No, she just said she'd be a bit longer. How long? Dunno. My God, Something about catching a fery. Fery? Oh my God. ro Sassni'tz, Why the fery? l don't know why. Which fery? What do blind people say? ''l'll be seeing you''? Yes. Just like you. Even though you can't see? Even though you can't see. l'm reaching out to you. See you. See you. Bye. Tell me what you look like... so l can recognise you next time. l'm a stubby gnome. Big nose, pointy ears. ln other words, ugly. Good. l'll remember. Jakob, let me go. Come back. We missed it. l don't understand. l just don't understand her. Why is she doing this? l don't know. Maybe he kidnapped her? That would almost be a relief. Paul will be beside himself. He'll be worried sick. First you want to get rid of me. Now suddenly... you won't let me go. l want to go home. Leave me alone. Piss off. Jump off a building... run in front of a truck... die however you want. Just do it. Now it's busy. She's probably on the phone with Alex. Why doesn't she call me? Why, Regine? Why? She's kidnapped. Nothing else makes sense. Yeah, right. When you're silent, it's like you're invisible. Like you're not really there. Like you don't exist. lt's when l hear you that you take shape. When you speak... when you play music... you materialise. Lilly, ... what do you see? l don't understand. Can you see anything at all? Spots, light, shadows? Anything? Jakob l don't even know w!hat seeing is. l see the world through different eyes. ln my own way. l see with my fingers... and my entire body. Maybe even better than with eyes. Fog. What about fog? Nothing. Nothing what you call colours. No yellow... no blue... no fog. lt's like looking through a veil. Things disintegrate. Mesh with their surroundings. This is your hand. You're the first person whom l can recognise by their hands. lf you were to wear gloves... l wouldn't be able to. l couldn't feel this soft parrt here. Or this rough parrt here. l'd know that they were the right size. That they might even belong to you. But l couldn't be sure. lt's like looking through fog. Are you asleep? l'll never get used to the fact... that it's not bright... when l open my eyes. Hello, Alex. l thought... you might want some bread and milk. By all means. ls your family back yet? Uh huh. Don't you want to take off your jacket? Nope. You're courageous. Why? l wouldn't have dared to return. Have a drink, Ben. To take the edge off. What am l saying? You should be glad to finally become a man. l think l should go now. Drink and cast the die. Please remove six arrticles of clothing. Lilly. At last. l'm headed to Onega on the Whi'te Sea, What where are you! going? To Onega. Tell mamma not to wory. l'llbe back i'n a couple ofdays, How is he? And be sure to tell Paul that he needn't wory either. What? You want me to lie? Doyou have company? Why? There's nobody here. -Yes, there is. Me. l thought you were against lying. When is your family coming back? Don't wory. It'll be awhile. They're in Russia. Do you know this route by hearrt? Yes. We used to visit my grandparents evey summer when l was a kid. My dad was always working... and we went wherever work took him. Reykjavik, Archangelsk, Hamburg... And where is he now? He died... when l was eight. My dad walked out on us. l didn't even notice. How may l help you? What sorrt of spirits do you have? l've got brandy. What about vodka? Do you sell food? -Sandwiches. And what's this? Bitters. Good for the stomach. That's not bad. What time is it? Just after two. There used to be a field here full of scarecrows. Right here? Yes. Excuse me. Are there any scarecrows out there? No, just a lake. What did he say? He said the scarecrows are there. Hello. Want to buy a chicken? A nice fat chicken. No, beat it. For your wife. She's not my wife. Not your wife? Then it's your girlfriend... l'd hate to see your wife. Get out of my face. You get out of mine. l want you to give me a hug. What? l really need one. Regine, l don't feel like it... Pity. lt's not too much to ask. They sell flowers here. Yellow... Blue... What is yellow like eXactly? Yellow is... Yellow is the feeling of... stones warmed in the sun. Someone once told me that yellow is the sound a flute makes. lt's not. lt's stones warmed in the sun. Cobble stones? Pebbles. l see. Are we there? lt's too quiet. Yes. Where's the bus driver? l don't know. Maybe he got out. Oh God. What are you doing? l'm going. l'm not going anywhere. Ever. Have it your way. Let me have the mobile. l want to ty to reach Alex. Regine, my mobile... lt's gone. -What do you mean gone? Stolen? l'm not sure. Shit. lt makes no difference. There's no reception here anyway. Russia is full of holes. We're near something. Come again? Don't you notice? There's no more wind. lt's a door. Hello? Open it. Go inside. Excuse me. Good afternoon. Could you please help us? The door is stuck. Hey, Lilly. There's someone here. Good afternoon. Hello. My name is Lilly Walter from the rehabilitation centre for the blind. How may l help you? No thanks. Tastes great. That looks good. What's in it? Lots of things... a whole lot of things. The raindrops on the leaves... Some seep through. There's something on the ground. A can. A whole field full of cans. There's a stone. A lake. Funny. There is something in it. lf you listen carefully you can hear the path the raindrops take. And... can you hear my hand? Yes. And can you hear me? Are elks native to the area? No. Could you please help us? We're lost. Much to his dismay... he is unable to hear you. Practically speaking... he is deaf. Can we help you find your way? Yes, please. Alright. Then come along. Right this way. God, l'm stuffed. l hope l don't get sick to my stomach... like you. Why so silent? What do you want me to say? l'm not the one who wanted to ty his home cooking. We should be looking for your daughter. Ask her. Excuse me. ls there a telephone nearby? Telephone. Do you understand? No one's there. Wait, someone is. Hi, this is Ben. Hello Ben, can l speak toAlex? Of course. Who am l speaking to? l'm Ben ,,, and l'm naked, Your daughter is still wearing something. And that's unfair. Hello mom, it's me Alex. Li'l/y hasn't calledback, Who was that on the phone just now? l toldyou not to wory, Alex, who was that? Li'l/y can take care ofherself fine without you. Who was l just speaking to? To Ben. He is naked. And tonight l become a woman. Bye, mamma, Oh God. Doesn't that just beat all. The elk seems happy. l take it, he is glad that you are unable to see... his rather disfigured... personage. Yes... we're there. The lady... who resides in this house has taken it upon herself to provide... charming guest rooms. Night. Good night. Of course... you're coming home. There's nothing to decide. Paul loves you. He'd move mountains for you. l know that, mamma. He is a great man. He'd never... leave you in the lurch. -You mean like dad? Don't do anything you'll regret. Paul can put a roof over your head. A perfectly good life. You won't have a thing to wory about. Neither will l. What if l want to wory? Maybe it's a parrt of life. Maybe we have to take risks... even dangerous ones. ls that what the blind man says? His name is... Jakob. We're talking about a blind man - with no job and no future. None whatsoever. l'm sory to be the one to tell you... but he's not for you. You're not sory. l'd just like to stress one thing... a blind couple... can't bring up children. And l know that you want children. Mom you're talking n'onsense. No, l'm not. She's right, Lilly. Jakob, wait. l'm sory. My mother was out of line. -Your mother is right, Lilly. Stay with Paul. He's the one for you. And we both know it. Tell him l dragged you aboard the ship. That's how it was. Wasn't it? And what about us? l don't even know who l am. l just don't. When l did theatre... l knew where l belonged. Now, my sole ambition... is to visit my mother before she dies. Even if l can't see her. Where are you going? -l've got to take a leak. Go away. Please. You said you needed me. No... not anymore. Don't you have feelings... for me? No, Lilly... l don't have feelings. l'd just like to eXpress what a pleasure it is to help you on your way... but nonetheless sad. lf only we could have had a little bit more time with that radiant... young woman. What does she look like? Her face is narrow... and often has a stern eXpression. But when she eXpresses joy... those looking at her fill with joy. And her mouth... Wait. Stop. l don't want to hear anymore. Wait a sec. l can't find her anywhere. l just can't find her. Look, there she is. How nice. Mamma, you're alive. Mamma what's going on!eXactly? l'm celebrating. Celebrating? l've trecked clear across Europe because l thought you were dying. Don't wory, l'm dying alright. Do you think it's really a time for celebration? lf not now, when? But now tell me why l had to walk to you. l'm blind. Yes... l couldn't have come up with any other eXplanation. l was in a car accident. My retinae have died. Let's join the others. Celebrate with me. Reach out to me and l'll lead the way. Did you come all this way on your own? How did you do it? l don't know. Here you go. Thanks. Sugar? Please. Allow me. See if it's enough. Ty it. Drink up. We have to be on our way. l won't be joining you. What do you mean? l don't get it, Lilly. Are you going to stay here by yourself? That's right. l'm staying here. You're not coming? Of course she's coming. Lilly, you can't stay here by yourself. Yes, l can. No. Shut up. ls there someone else? There is. And what about us? You can't stay here. You have no idea where you are. You won't find him anyway. You don't even know... what he looks like. You're blind. When l was a child... l didn't know l was blind. l couldn't understand, mamma,... how you always knew when my knees had cuts on them. You didn't even have to touch me. l thought that... when l grew up... l'd be able to do the same thing. But that day will never come. Ever. No. But now l know that the only thing l can't do... is see. Forgive me. Shit. Alright, let's go fori't, rhere's no turni'ng back, Do you know what to do? God, you must think l'm really dumb or something. Of course l know. Wait, maybe first we ought to... Nothing first. This is a mutually beneficial sexual agreement. Don't talk like that. ls it going to hurrt a lot? How am l supposed to know? Are you scared? A bit. l wanted to die. Yes... l still want to. l wish l could have seen you one last time. l can't really remember what your face looks like. Funny... how the faces you love most... are the ones that vanish first. Scents live on. Taste too. The way the tears on your cheeks tasted when l used to comforrt you. You were so small... and your cheeks were so warm. Rosy and warm. The stench of the locker room after football practice. Who'd have ever thought kids could smell like that? What is that? Did you really think l'd be able to wait so long for you? Stop it. l'm stopping. Your mother will die even without my help. But it would take ages and no one wants that. There are times... death can be... catharrtic. Redemptoy. Will you miss me? l've spent my life missing you. l know. But you've always done well without me. And what about now? What? Am l the only woman in your life? No, mamma. You aren't. Tell me about her. Her hair flows down her neck... ever so gently. She smells... She smells... like the wind... and her voice... is... blue. Blue as the sky. Off you go. Can l get a lift? Hey man, you're real cool. Thanks for the lift. l'm Christina. No. Have you seen him? Can't you see? No. Neither can the blind woman. You've seen a blind woman? Yes. Where? Can you take me to her? -No. But there's something l can do. Use this to speak to her. Get on with it. Lilly... lf you can hear me... lt's me... Jakob. l'm looking for you... and l... Lilly, l... l hear your hair... your face. l hear you. You. Shall we? Yes. ls it over? l think so. lt was good. Really good. Kiss me gently. And again...
