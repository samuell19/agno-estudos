There he is. Shoot him. Let's get this over with. Let's kill this son of a bitch. Argh. I twisted my ankle. He was one of us. Not anymore. Let's move out. This exercise is over. This is not over yet, Hogan. Bang! Hogan. You're out of here in 30 minutes. Get your shit together. Ain't nothing here I want. Suit yourself. It's good to see you, colonel. You look pretty good for having spent 25 years in that place. I got the new camp set up. And trainings already started, just like you told me to do. – I was hoping that – – Hey! Stop talking and start driving, bitch. Mmmmm. Oh. What do you want, baby? I want you to be up. Why? So you can take out the trash. - So I can take out the trash? – Yeah. Okay. Just give me a minute. I'll be out in a second. Tell her to get me some coffee. Oh. Oh. Morning, honey. Morning. Oh, someone needs to brush their teeth, hon? What do you want me to do first? Take out the garbage or brush my teeth? Both. In that order. Please. Hi. Poor me some coffee, will ya? Right after you come in and you brush your teeth. You better offer me honey. Do you want to inspect the troops, colonel? There's only one thing I want. And you know what it is. It's happening as we speak. It better be. Are these idiots ready? They are all set. Good. I've been waiting a long time for this. Hey, man. You know how to get to Ohio State from here? Yeah, sure. Just go straight ahead. Make a right at the light. You just keep on. That's it? Yeah. Sorry. Just go underneath the overpass. And you'll see it. Can't miss it. You got it. God dammit. I lost another life. Yeah, me too. I'm on my third already. This game sucks. Screw that. I'm going to try to find something else. Ahgh. There goes another one. This is the worst. There must be something we can do that would be better than this. I'm right there with you, man. But I don't know what it's going to be. We've already played pretty much everything out there. Yeah. No kidding. You know what would be cool? What's that? Would be if somebody comes up with something a little closer to real life. Yeah, like something more interactive. Right. Yeah, that would be awesome. But do you think something like that even exists? Well, we don't know until we look. You know it. True that. Hoedown. You remember me. At least I'm good. How was it for you? I spent 27 years in the hellhole. You didn't even send me a postcard. Tell me this is some kind of joke. 27 years. The press made you into some kind of hero. The damned hero left me out there to die. Well, guess what? I ain't dead. And now. Now it's time to get even. Now. The whole world is going to see who's been the best. You're crazy, Hogan. Run. You gotta be kidding me. Run. I'm going to kill all of you. Every one. And you. I'm saving for last. Not this time. Now you run, you son of a batch. Now go after him. Just remember. No one kills him but me. Got everything ready? Ready to go online sir. Let the show begin. Now they're gonna see. They're all gonna see. You are in a shit barrel with a gun. Argh! There he is. Ohh. All right. Make a noise, you die. You understand? Now what's going on here? What's Holden up to? I think it's just revenge. Revenge? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. You gotta be kidding me. What's with the cameras? He's got it all over the Internet. He wants the whole world to watch. Please. Please don't kill me. I just needed the job. You needed the job? You should've filed for unemployment. Having any luck? Naw. Not me. Wait wait wait. I think I might've found something. Yeah? What do you got? I just sent you guys the URL. Do either of you remember a guy named Mike Danton? Yeah. Isn't he the guy they based Rambo on or something? No no no. That was Terminator. No. It was neither one. But I remember my dad talking about this guy. It was in the eighties. And he apparently got wrapped up in some sort of weird military training exercise. where people were hunting other people. You know, like, for real. Right. Right. And killed like everybody. So like Terminator 2 then or…? No, man. This is for real, dude. Pretty much, yeah. It sounds so crazy. It is crazy, but it actually happened. And it might be happening again. Take a look at the link. I mean it looks cool but I can't believe this is real. Well, it might not be but it might. So why don't we take a look at it until we find out. True that. You are the great and powerful Mike Danton? You gotta be kidding me, right? Right? You sure don't look like much to me. Looks can be deceiving. This is going to be the easiest money I've ever made. You think so? No. I know so. You are not so so smart, are you, pal? What for? It's simple. You died. He's not dead, huh? No, I don't know where the hell he went. He went to take the trash out and he never came back. A new phenomena seems to be sweeping the Internet. And it seems to have something to do with men hunting men. Yes, you heard that right. We do not believe this is real. But we truly cannot say at this point. As of yet, no one knows where this feed is coming from. Or have claimed responsibility for it. We have the warning however that many of these images are shocking. We strongly recommend that you watch at your own discretion. Oh my God. Why is dad on TV? How are things going? Pretty much the way you said it would. He's killing most all of them. Well we do God to provide a little entertainment for our audience out there. Of course. Make Dan think it's going to be easy for him. Just for a little while. You are an evil bastard, Hogan. I know I am. You got a problem with that? No. Not at all. In fact. I find it kind of sexy. You do, huh? I do. Then perhaps it's time we go inspect the rest of the troops. I'm at your command. Good. I won't be disturbed for the next 15 minutes or so. You got it. Get in there. Heh heh heh. Four against one. You're not walking out of here, Danny. And you are? Oh, yeah. We're on. You're still good, Danton. Maybe even one of the best of them. But not good enough. Have a nice day. Too late. Argh. Oh. You want to end up like that? Do that and you will. Drop the gun. Stop shaking. I'm not going to kill you. You're not? Not yet anyway. I want you to take a message to Hogan. You tell him to let it go. If he doesn't, everybody is going to die. You got that? Yeah. I got it. I got it. And you tell him. He's not the only one who had 25 years to get pistol off. Go. Asshole. What do you want? I need to see the colonel. He's busy. I need to see the colonel. And I need to see him right now. It's important. I said he's busy. But I need to see him now. What the hell's going on here? Of course he is, you idiot. What did you think was going to happen? How the hell did you get away? Danton. Dan gave me a message for you. What are you, his delivery boy? No. Don't know. He was about to kill me then. He told me to bring you a message. That's all. Are you gonna tell me what that message is, soldier. He said to let it go. And everyone can just walk away. And if not… If not? What? He said… We're all going to die. Of course, he said that. What else is he going to say? He said, you're not the only one to have 25 years to get pistol off. Kill that coward. Ohh. Danton just doesn't get it, does he? Then the whole world will see how good he is. They want to kill him. To know how good I really am. There someone here to see you, colonel. Jas. You really do look just like your brother. Some say so. The real question is... Can you fight like your brother? No. I'm better. – Really? – Really. What say we put that to a little test. Fight him. This is going to be a very fair fight. Why not? Because he's already dead. Glad to have you with us, Thornton. Together, you and I will surely kill Danton. That's what I'm here for. You three go that way. I'll cover you. Move it. Ohh. Argh. Heh heh heh. OHh. Arch. Argh. Argh. Danton. Kaplan. What in the hell are you doing here? Getting a little old for this shit, don't you think? Yeah, bro. Things got a little slow in Afghanistan. You know me. I got a go where the work is. Yeah, well, you didn't go far enough. I can't believe hogans doing this shit to you again. Not after the last time. Tell me about it. Hey, Kap. I really don't want to hurt you. We got us a problem. What kind of problem? They get cameras here? Yeah, they got cameras. You know, Kap. Somebody's got a get hurt. Ohh. Danton. Where the hell are you, Hogan? I'm all around, Danton. Mostly, I'm under your skin. When are you going to stop sending me your Boy Scouts? Come and get me yourself. All due time, Danton. All due time. But firstly. I think you need a little more exercise. What the hell is that supposed to mean? This. This is almost too easy. He's going right where I want him to go. Of course he is. So what do you guys think? I think Danton's in trouble. True that. So then the question is… What do we do about it? What can we do about it? The first thing would be to figure out where he is at, right? Trace that video feed. Figure out where the signals coming from. Yeah. I mean where hackers.. If we can't do this. No one else can. Say no more, bro. Our trace program is already running. And then what? Oh, yeah. Then what? I don't know, but obviously we need to do something. True that. Thornton. That second group of men ready to go? Of course. Get them moving. Make sure they know what to do. Does this mean we have a little time to…? fool around? No. It means we have time to have fun with Danton. Sometimes I think you'd rather screw him than me. You might be right. I know it. What the hell you looking at? Do your job. You must be Hogan, right? Yeah. Who the hell are you? I'm Jason. This is Charlie. We are the guys who backed your little show here. Good to finally meet you. Yeah, right. What do you want here? Oh we are just here checking in on our investment. Putting a face to the name, so to speak. $5 million is still a lot of money, man. Look. You're getting what you want, aren't you? According to my people, they are watching this on the Internet all over the world. That's true, man. We are doing great with this. So great, we want to talk about turning this into a weekly Internet series. We could make many millions, dude. I ate your dude, boy. And don't you forget it. As far as this show, it's a one time event. Once Danton's dead, it's over. Got it? Look, Hogan. We are not asking you to change anything. Just maybe slow things down. So that we can space things out over more time. Yeah, man. More time means more money. Lots more money. Nothing's changing. You do anything to get in my way, no amount of money is going to help you anymore. You get my meaning? Do you? Yes. Yes. Perfectly. Then get the hell out of here. Go back to your six dollar coffees. And enjoy the show. I don't want to see you in here again. All right. All right. We get it. Come on. Thornton. What do you need? I don't think I can trust those dudes. Take care of it. Done. I think I got it. Really? Yeah. Okay. Check it out. The feed has to be coming from this area. Is it a signal coming from over here? Yeah. Well, that's not going to tell us where Danton is. No. But hopefully it should take us to the area. Okay see, check out this map. Okay. That's where the signals coming from. Right next to this national park. So he's going to be in there somewhere? That's my guess. Then what are we waiting for? Did anyone say "road trip"? I heard that. Let's go. Where the hell is he? What's that on the bottom? Is that – is that light? I know exactly what that is. Now I know exactly where he is. He was here all right. That's where the glow we saw on the camera came from. Let's go get him. Spread out. Keep in sight. Just remember. No one kills him but me. He's on the move. Go! We lost him. Dammit. He's just playing with us. Shot up. Let's go. Move it. Argh. I killed you. You're dead. Not as dead as you're going to be. Don't do it. Don't do it, Thornton. I know he killed your brother. You want your revenge. Hello, you're entitled to it. You'll get it. Not here. Not now. Your brother was a faithful soldier to me. Always knew how to obey an order. What about you? Shit. Oh. Well well well. What will we do with you now? Argh. Heh heh heh. So he's the big hero. The man himself. Mike Danton. The man thinks he's the best. Well you sure don't look like the best right now, do you? Heh heh heh. No, he sure don't. Cause there's only one best. That be me. He knows it. I know it. And all you out there know it. So the real question is… How will the great Mike Danton meet his end? It should involve torture, perhaps? Oh, that would be fun right there. Should I drag it out? And make his last moments as miserable as possible? Or a simple blow to the head? Quick and easy like. I want to hear from you. Send me your emails or titters. Whatever you people do out there now these days. And let me know. Because in a few hours… It'll be over. Do you even know where we are going, man? Yes. Right here. That's not exactly what I'm talking about. Hey, let me ask you guys a question. Yeah, go ahead and ask it. Say we actually find Danton. What then? I don't know. Me neither. Help him out, I guess. And how are we supposed to do that? It's not like we have guns or anything, you know. Anyway we could. Yeah. Anyway, we could? Yeah, okay. That's cool, I guess. So you're Mike Danton? After all the fuss. I would've thought you'd be bigger. What I'm trying to figure out is how you managed to kill all the colonel's men all those years ago. Maybe I just got lucky. No. No, it wasn't luck. You have to be good to beat Hogan. And you damn near killed him. I'm gonna kill him this time. And I'm going to kill you. Too. Oh really? Really. I could crush them right now. Just like walnuts. You can crush what ever you want. But I'm still gonna kill you. The only person in this room that's going to get killed is you. And I'm really gonna enjoy watching you die. Fuck you. Now that's a thought. But I'm afraid we just don't have the time. See you real soon, hot shot. What are you doing here? Since you let me live, I couldn't take off. I gotta do something for you, buddy. You sure you want to do this? Damn right I do. Us old guys. We gotta stick together. That's all we got, Mike. Let me ask you. Are you ready to take a ride? Yeah. Let's do this. Let's go. Hey, chief. You seen the colonel? I need to talk to him. I guess he's in the command center. Where's that? Over there. Oh. Shh. Is it clear? Yeah, come on. Let's go. Hey, guys. Anybody got a light? – No. – Naw. Oh. Hey. You forgot something. Son of a bitch. That's Danton. Move out. Come on. Let's go. What do you want? You. Dead. Oh. What the hell happened? The ass hole helped Danton escape. Son of a bitch. What's going on out there? Danton escaped. I'm taking the men with me. Going after him myself. It's time for you to do your thing. Are you sure? Ask me that again. And I'll kill you. I love it when you get angry. Just do it, dammit – Come on, move out. – Move out. Oh. Oh. Argh. This guy's good. Yeah, so I've heard. He's close. Good. Move it. Hell, yeah. Woo. Get him. Let's move. So where the hell are we? I don't know. I'm still waiting on kid genius over here to tell me the way to go. Hey, you know. I'm working as fast as I can. If either of you think you can do a better job, have at it. No. That's definitely a job that only you can do. True business. Uhh. There it is. Shoot him. You think you got him? Of course I did. Move out. Move out. Don't shoot. Please. Don't shoot. Hey. That's him. That's Mike Danton. Sure it is. Wow. How the hell do you know my name? Who are you guys? I'm Stephen. This is Frankie. And that's Candy Girl in back. Hi. What are you guys doing here? We came out here to help you. Yeah, we've been watching it all on the Internet. And tracked the feed to this location. Okay. Now listen to me. You need to get the hell out of here before you get yourself killed. You understand me? This isn't a game. Yeah, we know. Jump in the car and come with us. It's not a good idea. Shoot them. Stop that car. Come on. Get in quick. Go go go! We got Mike Danton in the car with us. How cool is that, man. Just about as cool as it gets. Hi again. Floor it Duck! What the hell happened? We got lucky. Go. Did you get him? No. It doesn't matter. He'll be back. How do you know? Because in about an hour or so, I'll have something of his he's gonna want. What's that? Let's get back to camp. I'll show you. Hey man. We got shot at. Yeah. With Mike Danton in the car. Hi. Wait here. I'm going to give you one chance to live. Oh, really? Really. Where is my wife and son? I thought that would've been more than obvious. He's here. Right. Let me guess. It's for me. I got your woman, Danton. Keep this between us, Hogan. You and me. Oh, it is between us. It's always been between us. This is just part of it. You mess with my family, Hogan. I'll make you pay. In ways you can't even begin to imagine. Shut up, Danton. You do exactly like I tell you. Otherwise I'll do all sorts of evil things to this little bitch. Things they didn't even do in prison. You hear me, boy. Yeah, loud and clear. Meet me tomorrow at dawn. You and I will have it out. I'll be there. Of course you will. You're stupid like that. Well. What will we do with you next? It's going to be a lot of fun to watch you die. It's You're gonna be sorry you did that. Somehow I don't think so. Holy shit. You just blew her fucking head off. I told you guys to wait outside. Yeah, I know, man. I know. I just thought maybe we could help. I thought you might want to see this. This. I found him creeping around out in front of the house. Michael. You okay? Yeah. Listen. These are daddy's friends. They're going to take you somewhere safe, okay? While I go get your mom. You guys okay with that? I was hoping we could help you a little more than that. Listen to me. You go back out there, Hogan's going to kill you for sure. Just take him somewhere safe. And I'll hook up with you later. Sure. Yeah. You got it. Of course. Hey, Michael. We're gonna get mom. Don't worry. Go with them. Go. Go. Come on. To all you sick fucks out there. You've been watching my little game. Today is the day you don't want to miss. Because today is the day the man who left me out there to die. Pays his due. Today I get my revenge Because today is the day Mike Danton dies. You can count on that right there. Everything ready. Of course. Let's do this. Let's go, honey. Time to have some fun. My husband's going to kill you. Yeah right. I've heard that before. Let's go. You two stay with her. You spot Danton. Even think he's in the area. Fired two shots in the air. You got it? Yes, sir. Got it. You better. You fuck this up, I'll kill you myself. I've killed more people than cancer. The rest of you follow me. Oh. Fuck. Ooof. Ugh. What are you doing? He's close. He's very close. Okay, men. Stay close, keep your eyes open. Thwack. Argh. Uhh. Get him. Get that son of a bitch. Move.

You take care of your mom, okay? I'm right here, Hogan. Didn't even bring a gun. I thought maybe you want to do this man to man. That's the problem with recruits. I try to teach them something. And then they go start thinking for themselves. You're no damn different, Danton. I just thought you'd want the satisfaction. After all those years in prison. You're right. I do want that. Sometime you just don't get what you want. Danton. Hey, that's Hogan. Ha ha ha. What the hell's this, Danton? Your backup? Ha ha ha. You shouldn't have come here. He's right, you know. You shouldn't have. Oooof They had nothing to do with this, Hogan. Aww. Fuck them. Now it's your turn, Danton I'm going to kill you. You son of a bitch.. What the hell are you doing, Danton? You're not getting out of this this time. I got news for you, Hogan. I already have. Shit! Oooah. Fuck. Yay! Whoa! Sometimes I sing all I can sing. I get tired of trying all the time. Step-by-step. Day after day. Sometimes life is more than I can take. But I never say die. I'll never give up. I will walk through the way. Again and again. I'll never say die. I keep a fiction when I was young. Every other what little I was. Lie by lie. Blow after blow. They did their best to take away my soul. I'll never say die. I'll never give up. I'll walk through the way. Again and again. I'll never say die. I'll… never say die. I'll never give up. I'll walk through the way. Again and again. I'll never say die.
