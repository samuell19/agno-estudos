(Filipino accent): "Jesus, are you coming "back home for Easter? I'm by myself in heaven, and it's very lonely." (chuckles) (normal voice): And Jesus is like, "Ah, Dad, I'm busy. "I'm-- All day, I've been turning water into wine, "and-and the Romans, they scare me. "I've been running away. -(laughter) -"Uh, by the way, "I got 12 friends coming over for dinner. -I don't have time." -(laughter) And God's like, "Okay, fine, Jesus.

He'd rather be home. Kids got it easy. Am I right, Father Hildo? They got it so easy. I mean, look at that picture of Jesus right there. Jesus died for our sins. My son dies when I take his phone away for two hours. (laughter) He doesn't know what to do. He just walks around the house like he's been crucified. -"What did I do to deserve this, Dad? -(laughter) "I need my phone back, Dad! (laughter) "I need Spotify. "I ordered Uber Eats! I want to go on Instagram!" (laughter, applause) But I'm joking. I'm happy I'm home to see my mom. I really am. But, God, you make it difficult. You really do. My mom is at war with my Tita Teresa, and none of us know why. If you didn't know if they were related, look at their dresses. (laughter) Both of them got it at Marshalls.

Well, maybe. Depends on your grades, which kind of suck at the moment, but... Yeah, we just need to spend more time together while we can. That's all that matters. I'm sorry you didn't get the show, Dad. -You deserved it. -Mm. Something else will come along. Honestly, it was worth it. Got to spend time with you and the family. (Joe chuckles) (sighs) You know, besides us almost getting shot and you collapsing, today was, like, the best day ever. -(laughs) -MANNY: Knock, knock. Who's there? -Who's there? -JOE: Hey. -Are you okay? -(overlapping chatter) -Joseph. -Oh. -Aw. (chuckles) -Aw. Okay, so are you guys good now? -Yes. Thanks to you. -Mm-hmm. SUSAN: I love you, Joseph. You're such a good boy. -I'm so proud of you. -Aw. We all are. I'm sorry about the TV show, you guys. (sighs) I should've been honest. Hey, Kuya, your phone rang, so I answered it. Oh. Yeah. Joe, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Hi? I hear you're at the hospital, so I'll make this quick. We're not interested in you for Great Sco anymore. (sighs) Yeah, I-I know. I-I kind of figured that. Because we want to create a show about you and your family. The Joe Valencia Show starring Joe Valencia. (all gasping) -Wait. What? -What? -What? You left us on FaceTime, and we heard everything. The dinner, -the fight, the song, -(laughing) the crazy, crazy love that is your family. And that's the show we want to make. So, what do you say? Are you kidding? Yeah! (cheering, excited chatter) ("Up the Mood" by Koncept playing) Make sure I'm the prettiest. ♪ You spin the records, we crush the groove ♪ ♪ Two heels click, then bust a move... ♪ (imitating Eugene): Oh, come on, Kuya. It's a great idea. Okay, explain it to me again, Eugene. It's a hypetruck. -(fingers snap) -Hypetruck! WOMAN: Joseph! BOTH: Uh-oh. Joseph, what have you been doing in here? Come help in the kitchen. SUSAN: Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Hoy! -(soundstage bell rings) -(speaks Filipino) I don't sound like that. -She sounds spot-on to me. -(laughter) -Mom! -What? Hey, Lou Phillips, uh, I just got -a quick acting note for you. -No. And don't call me "Lou Phillips." You got to say "Diamond." -No, but this is our thing. -No, it's not. Well, I wouldn't do the snaps and a little bit more from the diaphragm. So it'll be like, "Hypetruck!" Hypetruck! Is that it? -JOE and EUGENE: Yeah. -Yeah? -JOE and EUGENE: No. -Oh. SUSAN: Joseph, I come all the way down to L.A., and still you don't want to spend time with me. I'm trying to work, Mom. Look. Please get off the set. -Nick! -NICK: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, Antonio. I'm going over Mulholland. Got to go. Yeah, oh, I'm gonna lose you. Bye. (inhales sharply) What's up, buddy? Can you do something about this? Yeah, I don't want any piece of that. Where the hell is security? SUSAN: I already told Jamie that you need -extra time off for Christmas. -Why would you do that? You're coming home for Christmas... Can you please get these people off the set? -JOE: Why are you guys on the set? -I'll get right on it. Joseph, you're coming home for Christmas. Okay, everybody, back to your seats. -Watch it, Arthur! -Except her. -She does what she wants. -What is going on? I'm not doing anything wrong. -I'm just trying to help, Joseph. -Oh, my God, Mom. You need to get some sleep. Why do they start so early? Did you eat breakfast today? So what do you think about Christmas? You're coming home, right?
