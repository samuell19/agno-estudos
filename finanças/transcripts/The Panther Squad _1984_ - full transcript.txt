It fills the streets. With one eye open. It never sleeps. She's got it loaded. Always ready. She's not afraid. Yeah, she holds it real steady. She won't run away. She won't run away from the wolf in the night. Run away. She won't run away. She's tough and tender, does it right. Ungh. Always moving, like a shadow hard to see. When she finds you, like a knife, she'll cut so deep. She's got a heart full of passion. Won't break in the heat of the action. She won't run away. She won't run away from the wolf in the night. Run away. She won't run away. She's tough and tender, does it right. She's tough and tender. She's tough and tender. She does it right. She's tough and tender. She's tough and tender. Yeah. Whoo. Run away, run away. She won't run. Run away, run away. She won't run away. She's tough and tender. Run away, run away. She's tough and tender. Run away, run away. Yeah. She's tough and tender. She'll make you crazy. You wanna love her. Like a magnet, you want, you want. She won't run away. She won't run away from the wolf in the night. Run away. She won't run away. She's tough and tender, does it right. Run away. She won't run. Run away. She's tough, tough and tender. Run away. Run away. She won't run. The following program is brought to you by NOON, the New Organization of Nations. Your attention, please. The president of NOON, the New Organization of Nations, is about to announce an event of the utmost importance. Citizens of the world, as you all know, the letters N-O-O-N, NOON, stand for the New Organization of Nations and are the symbol for the rise of mankind, which has now reached the high noon of its destiny-- conquest of space. Therefore, all nations of the world, with the exception of a few small islands, cozy and sunbathed republics, have resolved to enter together into the new age of space, which will bring peace and prosperity to all nations. This has only become possible through the invention of a totally new means of interspatial communication. It's called the Space Jeep and has just been launched on its first voyage. After the successful completion of this first test flight-- This is a message from Clean Space, the anti-pollution commando. The voice you're now listening to is being broadcast worldwide from our ultra-secret space transmission center. We have lost our fight against pollution of the earth. We shall win our fight against pollution of space. Your Space Jeep is therefore under our control and will remain so as long as you do not meet our demands. Clean Space requires the cancellation of the entire space program. Remember, your pilot and the Space Jeep are from now on in the hands of our technicians. Get me Space Center, quick. Yes, sir. Hi, Fred. Listen, we've got to change Sam's trajectory. What? Sir, that's out of the question. Changing trajectory means changing orbit. Nothing doing. Don't argue. That's an order! Yes, sir. Henry? Yeah? Start up number three, slow, and move from H to six. Got it? Yeah. But if you ask me, you're gonna blow up the whole thing. You heard what the man said. Orders. OK, OK. You're the boss, I'm the wiz. I just hope you know what you're doing. Here we go. Three, normal. H six plus three. Overheating on the first. Trajectory? Unchanged. H six, danger point. Back to four. Temperature of the cooling system? 208. H six on to five. Temperature? 220. Four everywhere. Six minus plus five. Five minus plus four. We're locked on four. Temperature? 220. Move H to infinity. Impossible. Saturation of the module. Temperature? 225. Back to three. Well, Mr. Nelson, we can't do anything now. Our signals are being reflected. We'll try to shut the circuits. OK, try it. Get me Brussels. Training center? No, not the training center, headquarters. Mr. Barrot. Yes, Nelson? Sure, I know. The president's address was worldwide-- and so was the ultimatum. They're bluffing. I doubt it. I've given orders for a test. They're trying right now to change the trajectory of the Space Jeep. Hold on. Shit! Well, keep trying! That's what I'm doing. Cut number one. Connect to three block in parallel. Well, it's no bluff. Our signals keep coming right back. All circuits broken. Locked in free thrust. How the hell did they do that? Let's try again. All right, if you say so. But remember, if we bust that module, the whole thing blows up. All this crap to please that damn Nelson, huh? Not quite. Remember, there's a guy up there in that Space Jeep spinning round and round. What they do have is probably a magnetic barrage against outgoing signals, same kind as their TV interference. It blots out anything we try to send out and gets anything they want on the air. That's the story. So what can we do? We've got a spare one ready for launch. Ah, you mean that girl, uh, Jane Dantine, Sam's stand-in? Sure, fine-- uh, that is if she can take off right away. Sure. She's as good as he is. They were both trained together. Barrot, remember, she needs protection, for those Clean Space characters. All right. Don't worry, I'll pick her up myself and bring her to the plane. Put on 305. Would you please get my own car ready? And please rush a security car over to the center. NOON security car number 27, go straight to the training center to meet Mr. Barrot and astronaut Jane Dantine and escort them to the airport. Car number 27? Gotcha, kid. We're on our way. Hey, what's this? An accident. Jesus. Come over here, will you? I have a date with some cute astronaut, and we're going to be late. Bah! Hurry! We gotta pick up the astronaut before Barrot gets there. Oh, uh, Mr. Barrot couldn't make it. He sent us to drive Miss Dantine to the airport. Well, let's go. Where's Dantine? She's gone already. What? Get me to the airport, quick. This is a message from the organization Clean Space, space without pollution. You are already aware of our preventing your signals from watching your so-called Space Jeep. We know that without those signals, your man in space will remain in orbit forever. We also know that only one other person able to pilot your spare Jeep is presently our guest and will remain with us as long as necessary. But we are not murderers. On the contrary, we want to save the world from pollution. All you have to do to save them is to cancel your space program. End of message. Find a way to get this cassette to General Boele. And now, boys, we are going to Guasura. I'm telling you, it's right here on the cassette. Jane kidnapped, tied to a chair, and poor Barrot killed on the road. Well, if they want to play it rough. We figured the exact site of Jane's disappearance at Ostend Harbor. An abandoned ambulance we found there two days ago fits the description-- We'll play it even rougher. I'm gonna send you the toughest cookie in our job. Dammit! Run away. Just be at the airport when she arrives. I'll get you the exact flight number and the time, OK? I'll send her an official car. No, no, you don't have to send an official car. What this lady has, you wouldn't want to camouflage. All she needs is a chauffeur, on time, at the airport. You see, this lady gets into action real fast. A boat called Lord Byron left Ostend yesterday. Don't know where it was headed for. The owner is a woman. Before leaving, she did some heavy recruiting around the harbor. Wander around, you could learn some stuff. Here's her name. Barbara Wims. Anything else I can do for you? No, thanks. That's all. Excuse me, sir, but is there the slightest chance you know-- Hey, you two up there. Yes, you. I'm looking for a boat that probably has a big sign on it with the name "Lord Byron." I got it. Hello. I'm a friend of Barbara. Is she here? Do you know where she is? I have a message for her. It's very important that she gets it as soon as possible. Make sure that she gets it, OK? Ugh! Uh! Oh! Ugh! Ah! Ugh! Ugh! Ah! See anything around here? Hmm, Ramirez. Probably one of Barbara's clowns. Coteras, Guasura. Our local operative's a real dynamo. There aren't many like him anymore. Frank Randall is his name. Wait till you see him in action. Now, we all know how dangerous this operation is. He's the one with that little surprise package we spoke about. But remember, only to be used in emergency-- a last resort. I'll keep my eyes open for the package. You keep your ears open for the good news. Here's Randall's address in Guasura. 3 Plaza Mayor, Coteras. Time for action. Nelson's agent's coming to you. Well, I didn't expect to see anything quite so lovely this time of the morning. Uh, you here for the sun and the fun? No, I'm here for the action. Frank? Yeah, I think so. Ilona. Beautiful name, beautifully lady. Won't you come in? You know, this a pretty rough place. Do you think you can take all these characters around here? Ah, the last of the macho men. No, beautiful women are my favorite pastime. Like collecting butterflies, huh? Anna-Lea. She's my bodyguard. You want one? Root beer on the rocks. Now, uh, did you receive a diplomatic pouch with my name on it? No, I only get junk mail around here. It's hot stuff, so when it does come, get it to me. Sure. So, que pasa? Nada. Nothing. Oh, yeah, I got an address on Ramirez. He runs a dive down by the waterfront. Hmm. Anchors away. Aye aye, sir, or miss, or-- Don't shoot! Ah! I want her alive! Ah! Ah, let go of me! Ow! No! Everything's cool. Oh, lovely, you came incognito. I said it was a rough place down here. Rough trade. Fear not, lovely ladies, I have solid contacts, so after you. You sure they don't know you here? Just a lucky guess. My contact should be around here someplace. I think that's him. That's him? Yeah, the one with the Julio Iglesias haircut. You keep the bartender busy. When duty calls. The boat-- Lord Byron-- uh-- the boat-- If you wanna fight, fight, don't talk. You want a date, right? Ugh! What'd he say? He's bilingual. Well, he mentioned something else about a boat-- Lord Byron. Oh, Lord Byron, ah. Yankee, go home. Wrong game. I play football. Oh, you do? What position? What else? Kicker. Ugh! Be back in a minute. Fear not, eh? Well, I told them not to drink the worms in that stuff. Let's get out of here. Let's get to the airport. Hey, wait a minute. I have to call my mother and buy a toothbrush. Do you think we should have children right away? You know, this is awfully sudden. This is not an escape, it's an arrival. Ah, you're expecting something. Six somethings. Sensibility reigns. Six phantom jets? No. Six attack choppers? No. Six Gremlins? No. Six girls. Aha. What next, special cavalry? Missed. Oh, look, the Dallas Cowboys must be in town. Right league, wrong team. This is the Panther Squad. And this is Frank, our man in Guasura. Claims he works for the consul. Say hello to Frank. Hello, Mr. Frank. Dumpy, Grumpy, Slumpy, and Sleazy. Do they do windows too? No, they jump through them, and they shoot through them, but they don't clean them. Well, you can't have everything. Come on, girls, here's the minibus. OK, girls, we're dealing here with a circus. Their main stunt was to kidnap one of NOON's top astronauts. They're real clowns. But since they won't live up to your idol, Tom Selleck, I'll know where you are nights. The astronaut is probably being held on a boat around the harbor. We'll hit first thing in the morning. Today, just relax, and welcome to sunny Guasura. Oh, an oasis. Who's in a rush? It's great. Let's go for a swim. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm tired. Come on. Beats watching football, doesn't it? Yeah, it's, uh, great while it lasts. Meaning what? Oh, Antonio and his friends can get nasty. "The Empire Strikes Back," eh? Hmm. Shaky. 5% nerves, 90% liquor. And you are 100% correct. Like one? Root beer. So, uh, when should we expect the trouble to begin? Ooh. Tomorrow. The next day. Things move pretty slow around here. Ugh! Help! Ah! All right, recess is over. All right! You and you stand watch, the others hit the sack. And get your power sleep. Ah! Was it good for you too? Thanks for cleaning up that mess that burned on the lawn yesterday. Oh, and, um, did you see which way the young ladies went? No, but they mentioned about called, uh, Lord Byron. Frank Randall? Sometime. Sign here. Who's it from, Max Factor? From the consul. These guys are red hot. You can bring in our ace swimmers. Yah! Yah! Oh, boy, goodie. Playmates. You'll get front page. Now that you had your warm up, take the Jeep and keep your eyes on that truck. I'll catch you later. There's a roadblock further up according to the map. See any way we could avoid it? All right, ladies, take a hike. I'll handle the roadblock. Maybe, but let's be prepared. I want to take all the precautions I can. And I want police dogs too. But everything is quiet. I've got news. They're having trouble on the yacht. The two guys keeping watch have been attacked. Shit. But the women who did it have been captured. Get them up here fast. They're coming. I got a call from the truck. Good. I wonder why they use women. It worries me. Why? On the contrary. It will give our men an incentive. Maybe. I'll double the number of guys, just in case. Don't overdo it. We're in control, so relax. Still, I'd like to warn the boys on the road. Don't. No one knows that Jane is here. There is no point to start those mercenaries guessing. All we want them to do is to check the cars on the road, period. Uh, I'm a tourist. Would you please take some photos with me and your friends as a souvenir? You're from the Lord Byron? Yes. Come on. If you want to starve yourself to death, go ahead. We need you away from the space center, dead or alive. A hunger strike will not free you earlier. Earlier than what? You'll be free as soon as the New Organization of Nations accepts cancellation of the entire New Space Program. You must be joking. They never will. Meaning that you will stay with us for a long, long time. To keep you company, Miss Dantine. Jane Dantine, we'll get you out of this. Shut up! We need some discipline around here. Bullseye. The insects are bad here, but we'll need more than Raid to kill off that pest. OK, divide and conquer. You, you, you, to the bar, and you go get nosy. You with me, come on. Ugh! Cover that door. Ugh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ugh! Ugh! Let's get out of here! What about them? Shoot them! Ugh! Oh! What took you so long, huh? They finally have us under attack. Everybody to the fort. They're gone! They took Jane. Let's go! Ugh! Leaving without even a doggy bag? Wah! They went that way, didn't they? Who? Come on! That's the most relaxing drink I've had in a long time. Barbara to Clean Space chopper. Just finish up that red Jeep and what's inside. Sounds like some big bird's watching us. Chopper to Barbara. We'll teach them what macho is. Frank, get out! Hey, boogie. Frank, get down! You think you might need some guns? Yeah, and some bullets if you've got 'em. OK. Enough target practice. Now down to business. OK, first thing-- where are we, anyway? At this point, all the roads lead to the government headquarters. There is one? General Carlos, right there. Ah. OK. Come on, girls, we're gonna make a special delivery. Special delivery-- hey, wait a minute. I forgot your gift. How long have you had this? Let's go. Me too? You first. And now let me express our gratitude to Professor Fonestran. Professor. Professor Fonestran is a genius. It is he who invented the magnetic barrage which prevents the space centers of the world to communicate with their stations in orbit, their satellites, their astronauts! The magnetic barrage originates in our own space center, right here under the palace! From there, we will dominate the world. Only one device completes the magnetic route we have built around the planet-- their new Space Jeep. And only one person has been trained to operate it, a woman called Jane Dantine. Now, listen! Jane Dantine is down below in our dungeons. She's our prisoner! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Professor. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! There is nothing and no one who can stop me now. I will be the lord and master of the world. The so-called great powers will be reduced to slavery! You, my people, you, my faithful companions in arms, you will rule the universe! As president of Clean Space, and in the name of my organization, I take issue with the declaration you just made. We have given you our support, and we have given you our assets. We offered to use our technological device for the exclusive purpose of impeding the pollution of space. This way. You have betrayed us. I withdraw our support. Take that stupid ass out of here. I don't want to listen to all his nonsense. You won't have to anymore. No one will-- ever. Soldiers, friends, companions in arms! Today we celebrate the dawn of a new era. There was the age of the Roman Empire. Today begins a new age-- the age of the Guasura! Wine for everybody! You, get high, this way around the back. You go with me. Ugh! Ooh! Ah! Surrender or I'll blow your Nikes off. Come on, girls. Let's show 'em how to party. You stay here. The odds are only 40 to 1. General! There is nothing to worry about. I know what I'll do. Blow your brain cells, probably. I'll blow up the world if necessary. These trans-magnetic rays are powerful enough to interfere with worldwide television and prevent all outgoing rays from reaching space. I can set off an explosion in any nuclear power plant. There are hundreds of them around the world. I know how to do it, right here from our space center. We'll go there right now and take Jane Dantine as a hostage. Come on. Buck. Hurry up. We are taking her as a hostage. Yeah. General. However fantastic your plan happens to be, it can only harm mankind. But you will fail. That will teach you, you moron. You must destroy-- destroy-- destroy the space center. They fooled us. Their space transmission center-- they want to destroy the world. They can do it from their space transmission center. You must get there before. You must destroy the generator. Destroy it. Go now, quick. We've been fooled all along. Go. Go. Come on! Get the others. Drop that gun! You just take care of the astronaut. You son of a bitch! CLEAN SPACE PRESIDENT You must destroy-- destroy-- destroy the space center. You must destroy the generator. Only to be used in case of emergency-- a last resort. CLEAN SPACE PRESIDENT Destroy. I need a drink. Citizens of the world, after an incident of no great importance which slightly delayed the launching of our space program, it will now proceed as planned. A few seconds from now, you will be watching on this same screen the take-off of Jane Dantine piloting our second Space Jeep. Mankind's new age of space has begun.
