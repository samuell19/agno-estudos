- What is it? - Two pennies. I've found them there. They are mine. Everything here is mine. Give. What are you still doing here? You've already had your due. Get lost. And if we meet again, don't bother to salute me. Out! What a smell! You'd swear there's a pimp! You're going to get dirty. Whose bed did you fall of from this morning? Beggar! Still better than a pimp! After 40 years, the Ferramonti bakery shuts down. I'm through with flour. I'll get rid of everything, business and family in the same time. I even want to forget I have three children. I've supported you since you were born, and what good have you ever done me? Mario, how much have you stolen from me f0 [his day? Nothing. You've always given me money. To keep you out of prison. I've paid more than 10,000 /ire for your gambling debts, and your fiddling. You've already g0! your share 0f [he inheritance. Here it is. Now, do what you want. Steal, drop dead... you're no! my son an y/onger. What are you waiting for? G0 away! I am. But before, I want to show you something. Look. I've made it in only one day, without getting dirty with flour and without cheating on the weights. It's long since I've smashed one's face... Don't dare touch me with your dirty hands. What are you waiting to leave him alone? Of course, you've already stolen your share ten times over, pimp! You're indeed worthy of this gang! Listen to this monseigneufs son! Since you've married this Cispadan (from North 0f river P0), YOUTG GVGFI ITIOFG VGFIOITIOUS. And you, Pippo... You've never stolen any money from me. How could you have mustered the courage? Giving you money, is like putting a tie on a pig! You've never trusted me. You were wrong. I'm the only one resembling you here. It's only our asses that resemble one another. Know that I'm in for buying a hardware shop. One needs years to learn a craft. And one needs brains and balls, both that you don't have. I'll make it. I piss on your flour! Say it again if you dare! I'm sorry. Le! i! be clear. Here 's your share, end 0f story. Do you want it? It's agreed. When I kick the bucket I'll leave you a sackfull of shit! You'll only have that left! Your turn, my sweet daughter. If you give money, I want my dowry! Didn't you want to marry that scribbler? Enjoy him, he's your dowry! Not one of my pennies will get in to the hands of a Cispadan! He hates me because I represent the new Italy. What Italy? Priests own Rome! They won't have a say anymore. And you. little Piggy. Had you shown me even the shadow of affection, a little attention, everything would have been different. Have you ever said to me: "l love you daddy"? You tell it to me. We'll take everything from you. The houses and all the rest. We'll see each other in court. THE FERRAMONTI INHERITANCE I fuck you, whore children! Mr. Care/Ii, I won'! back down. I [rusted you because 0f your name, bu! you g0 back 0n your word. L didn 'I put i! well. You only have f0 help me. I '/71 all lost among, sho ve/s and nails. You can'! do [his f0 me. We're selling because we can't take care of the business anymore. Mu husband's sick. All this scrapheap confuses me. You should teach me. There'd be a way out. Which one? I could help you a few hours every day, especially in the mornings. I could come down to the shop and teach you. It's easy. You've perfectly understood my difficulties. If you want me to sign the contract right now, I'm ready to do it. As a matter of fact, here are... ...3,000 /ire now, and [he res! will come month/y. You'll see, you'll pe pleased... - I'm telling you it's this one. - No. Then I haven't got it. Do something else, it'd be better! Old dickhead! I haven't learnt anything in two weeks. There's no hurry, you will. What's there to laugh about? You get so worked up! Shopkeeping demands patience. You're not at all like your father. My father is a bastard. I don't want to hear anything about him. Never again. He has destroyed me. Me, who haven't stolen one penny out of him. And more, he got rid of me for 3,000 lire! 3,000 /ire, when he's got a fortune, hundreds of thousands! And thanks to whom? Who sweated blood? He treated me like he did my sister, that filth, who first runs away, and then starts a law suit for her dowry. And my brother, that bastard... My father, I wish him dead. He has to die, I have no pity for him. I'd go mad without this, I have to get even. One of these days... Please! You wan! f0 make me die 0f shame. If you have a little respect for me, please spare me this kind of scenes. It won't happen again, I swear it. I don't know what's in your head. Here, for today, it's 10 /ire and 3 cenfesi. If I were you, I wouldn't complain. Sure! Rome is a big buiding site and I sell nails, screws and bolts! The city mocks me. I just don't count. You've got to be connected, if you want orders. If you'd like, you could be connected l'> Yes, you. Your brother-in-law works at the Ministry for Public Works. That's where everything's decided. Maybe even right in his office. Never! I'd rather sell to parish priests, than beg from him. This "new italian"! How stubborn you are! Open your eyes, Rome is changing. The city spreads out like a dough. Worry about selling, forget the rest. Forget the rest! It's easy for you to say it. Do you want to get rich? Load shovels and picks and go to Ponfe M0//0. What for? The Tiber will overflow. How do you clean the mud? With shovels and baskets. You're right. You'll come back tomorrow morning, won't you? We've said two weeks. They're gone. Are you leaving me all by myself? You'll manage, I'm sure. - You've forgotten your handbag. - Thank you. Have you told Irene? Mr. Pippo came to ask for your hand. He wants to get married very quickly. D0 you get it? He's shrewd! He paid 3,000 /ire for the shop, and now he wants them back as dowry. Like this, he'll have both woman and shop for nothing! Pippo is a great boy. He didn't want to be a baker, but he never created money problems to his father. Enough talk about money! He is punctual, that I can say. Remember that he'll have to clear his debt first and find a house for himself, and then we'll talk again. Good afternoon. We've been waiting for you. Your collar is undone. Listen... Where are you going? Stay here. I'll call my father. - Stay here. - This is men's business. One moment. Make yourself at home. Mister Pippo is here - Are you nervous? - Evidently! I've made you wait for me. How beautiful you are! Listen... Pippo you go with Irene, my husband couldn't get up. - Is he ill? - As usual. Thank you. Let's go. Imagine my family's face when they'll know we're married! But the later they find out, the better it is. What is it? Promise you won't get mad. Alright, I promise. I've invited your family. My family? Even my father? Yes. And then your brother, your sister and her husband. I wan! f0 be a! peace with everybody. You shouldn't have. Stop this hate, you're of the same blood. Teta and her husband are honest people. Do you know Teta? You've become friends with these two thieves? I've twice run into them, by chance, in a shop. Have you spoken to them? I've found a sister in Teta, you must believe me. And then? We've seen each other four or five times. You're wrong to be mad on her. Make peace with your family. We've g0! [he same interests. Let's hope my father won't come. I'm sure he won't. He's someone who doesn't forgive anyone. Splendid idea, getting married in the evening. Bravo! Thank you. It was lrene's. Please. You've washed your neck, at least, haven't you? Stupid! - Congratulations! - Thank you. Congratulations! I knew it. See he didn't come? Mario didn't either. We'll make a lot of money, I can feel it. With you by my side, I feel very assured. We'll sell nails even to the pope. I'll nail again all the crucifixes in Rome! Aren't you getting undressed? Have I said anything wrong? Money, always money. You're right, forgive me. Did you embroider it yourself? It's wonderful. You're gifted. Please, leave me alone, I must undress. Come here. Now we are husband and wife. And for life. Come. Turn the light off. No, let in on, it's more beautiful like this. Come. Then don't look. I don 'I understand you. They never tell you, women, what's going to happen. Then the moment comes and... You're a princess. I was born under a lucky star. I've found out my father has decided to sell everything. Teta says he does it to be sure he'll leave us nothing. But we, we don't care. I told you, we'll be rich. I can feel it. Very rich. Come, now. I won't hurt you. You know, one has to move in this milieu. - You'd say we were at the court! - How many people! I understand you. In your shoes... But I wouldn't like it. A pity we can't see too well from here. - And from here? - There, it's better. - Shall we go up? - Of course. Is this the king's cavalry? The pope's was better. The rider is Roman. He has no grip, no authority. A good for nothing, like all Romans. But who is it that has made this city full of ruins and cats, the capital? You have! Why are you complaining? It's thanks to us and the Tiber... ...that it will be raining with millions on all the Romans. The Tiber? If the Parliament aproves the financing for the levies, the dredging and the adjusting of the river bed, there'll be work for everyone, don't worry. Now, I'm employed by the Auction Bureau for the Tiber, a big responsibility. And will they spend millions? I used to go chasing the toids in the Tiber. Toads! Do you think we'd stand a chance getting some orders? I was talking with Pippo. He'd like sharing the benefits with you. He likes you a lot and your husband has won him over. Don't worry, as soon as I'll know something, I'll tell you. Look. What? My stupid brother, his lover and her cuckold of a husband surrounded by shit authorities. I'm alone this evening. Come, I'll be waiting for you. He has an affair with Flaviana Berbati? Yes. The slut. Her husband is a schemer, meddling a little in everything. He does business with Mario, and him he does his wife. People love saying bad things. And then, when you're young... Have you seen, Mario? I had told you. I was right. I've herd. Banco Romano shares are falling. Fortunately I've sold mine as soon... ...as you've warned me. I've seen Mrs Lovisotti yesterday, at your cousin. Word goes they'll approve the financing for the Tiber. He told me it was a sure thing A nice victory for Banco Ital/co. Thanks to your advices, I'll be making sacks of money. For that, we'll be needing a lot of rain. - Is it raining? - A drop fell on me. Let's see. This changes... Careful with the umbrella, I'm soaking wet. Fall down, water from the sky, fall down! Flood Rome, it's lawns and all her streets. Take away the bridge, take me, take everything! So that they'll build those fucking levies! Mister Stefano! Good day, Mr. Pippo. Good day. Here it is, a little signature. Of course. Here? Just by the cross. - Everything's been delivered? - Yes, M. Pippo. Good bye. I've respected the deadlines and we've made a nice profit. It looks like you content yourself with little. You've always told me to be patient! Paolo's waiting the money we've promised him. What is it? Nothing why? Just like this. You're really beautiful, you know that? What's the matter with you? Nothing. Stop it! What's the matter with you lately? Sometimes I can't understand you. This is the real problem. Look! My father. He still is a handsome man. He's a moron! What do people say? About what? My stupid children! What have they done yet? Your daughter and Mr. Pippo have got rich. Thanks to your daughter-in-law. I've heard. What else? They're spending. They've renovated their house and move in high society. They kiss ass instead of working. Any news concerning the other pervert? He's still chasing skirts and getting rich. They're talking about millions. Millions! Bullshit! Is it for making me mad? May they drop dead! Not today. How many Romans have you seen? - She must be 20 years old. - No, more! To the new election law! - Will it pass? - And how! Stop eating. Aren't you ashamed? How are you? I'm glad to see you here. Thank you for inviting us. - No, aftenuard. - Aftenuard? I'm taking Mrs Ferramonti away from you, will you forgive me? I want to introduce you to a dear friend. Flaviana Barbati, Irene Ferramonti. - Glad to meet you. - Enchanted. I've heard a lot about you. - Really? - Let's find a quiet place. I've spoted you, at Pincio. You were wearing a blue velvet dress. I admit I was a little jealous. On me? I don't even know Mario. He has told me that. I couldn't believe it. What Court House? We'll never built anything in this bog! I agree with you. - A real kick in the butt for the pope! - True. The pope is against progress? If you don 'I move [he bed 0f [he Tiber, the Court House will always be flooded. Yes, we must build levies. And tall ones. The idea of making the Tiber flow far away from Rome, like an enemy, makes me laugh. For us, Romans, theTiber's here. and here it stays! Our arrival, we other italiens, means the end of catholic Rome. For God's sake. New faxes, scheming... The people has had enough paying for everybody. Then, Parliament mafia will take care of it! - Irene, we are leaving. - If you wish. You're already taking her away? Don't be selfish. It's very late. Let's stay a little longer. Please, be nice, I'm having a lot of fun. I'm not hiding it from you that I was expecting to see my brother-in-law and to talk to him. It was the perfect occasion of making peace with his own. My husband and my sister-in-law would agree. He went away on business, but I'll take care of it. I want to help you. Really? Have you seen what time it is? Why have you run away? You've left me alone! Paolo et Teta were there. You know I feel uncomfortable with those arrogant bastards! This Flaviana... Such friends you made with her! Are you jealous? You mustn't see my brother's mistress! You're wrong, like always. You don't know that Teta and Mario have alreay reconciled. Your brother has important friends. They've forgotten [he pas! and have made peace. It's not possible. Oh, yes. She hasn't told me anything. It seems Mario has introduced Paolo to a certain politician who'll boost his career. Their word is enough, do you understand? Flaviana has confided me that Mario would like to make peace with you, he has remorses. He 'd real/y wan! f0 see you. Yes, but... And I? What am I to do? Irene, what do you think? Is there a problem? Do I need your permission to get back? Where have I put it? - Who came out? - What? - Somebody has shut the door! - What are you talking about? I'm not deaf! I heard the door slam! It's your daughter-in-law, Mrs Irene. She came inquiring about you. LN' \ \ \\ “x ! /'/71 no! dead yet! You'll have f0 waif a long time! Is it your husband that brought this wine? Rosafo dei Col/i Euganei. Your dickhead 0f a husband knows our wines? That's it. He's here. I'm very pleased you have come. You're very kind. Come. What are we doing? Playing the figurines? He made one of those faces when I told him to come! Were you afraid? Don't listen to him I already knew, but I wasn't alone. We could have done it before. You're right. We '// get t0 know each other better, dear sister-in-laml. I know you know me by my bad reputation. I drink to Pippo's business succes. It is already accepted that your name will be on the state suppliers' list. Congratulations. And we won't stick only to shovels! Without me, you'd have done shit! I drink to all Ferramontis, one excepted! To Irene, also. We should all be grateful f0 her. It's [hanks f0 you if we are all here. like a real family. I want to prove you my gratitude. One week ago, I've bought 100,000 /ire worth of Banco Ital/co shares. Paying only 10,000, lent by the bank. Today, I've written in your name 10,000 /ire worth of shares. They've only cost me 1,000 /ire. In my name? And 10,000 for Teta. The shares went up 10% in one week. If you sell them today, you'll make 1,000 /ire. And you also. And you? I, 8,000. Enough for you to buy two shops. Then sell them! Sure! No, tomorrow they'll go up even more. Let's drink to our reconciliation. All together for progress! It's nice to get along well. It makes me forget all the money matters that have divided us. Did you know that Paolo's name was advanced for the Croce di Cavaliers? Congratulations. And father who only thought him good to sharpen pencils! He didn't understand anything. I don 'I wan! f0 be a civil servant all my life. - Let me show you the house. - Please. Here's the dining room. The kitchen and the maid's room. - It's big. - Come. And here is the bedroom. Nice. Without Irene, we wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have shaked Teta's hand. Paolo's either: this king's servant! But they were very nice. I've got orders thanks to them. Shovels, picks, baskets and so on. Little deals, but future looks bright. Women have always made a man's succes. You haven't changed. You're still relying on them. I've become an honorable man, you know... Me, I'm a serious merchant. Now P/pp0 Ferramonffs word is worth gold. And [his also [hanks f0 Irene. Bu! [his 8th wonder 0f yours... Doesn't she speak? Never a word? I '/71 listening f0 you, and I '/71 happy. I wouldn't like to bear your name without you having accepted me as a sister. You have, I hope. It's beautiful, what you've just said. We 're made f0 get along. I've got to run now. I've got a meeting. Will you show me out? Thank you. Goodbye. See you soon. You often meet the Barbatis for your businesses, don't you? I'm meeting them tonight to speak business. Give Flaviana my regards. It's been five days that I haven't seen her. Don't forget us. See you soon. Thank you. Good day. What would you like? Nothing, thank you. Who is it? Mario. I'm alone. I know. I hope you're not afraid to receive your brother -in-law. Come in. I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting you. Is it a nice surprise, at least? Here, I've sold your shares. Thank you. It's a nice sum. Indeed, the profit exceeds my expectations. Let's say I've chosen the right moment. How should I thank you? If you really want to thank me... What am I to do? Do you remember when I've said: "We're made to get along?" We should make a pact. Meaning? We must become partners. To what and? I want to prove you my friendship even more. I want to become your personal banker. - You already take care of Flaviana. - It doesn't matter! With you, I can make a lot more. You're a sensible woman, you'll know your way. Be contented with what you've got, don't go looking elsewhere. I've already found what I was looking for. Listen to me carefully, Irene. I've never thought you to be ingenuous and shy. I've understood your strength when you've married Pippo without a dowry. You've imposed your extravagant life on him and you have attracted the Furlins so you could have your own court. Look into my eyes. I'm here because you've wanted to. You need me. Enough! I forbid you to go on! You're going to listen to all I've got to say. You have an project and an end. Use the others if you want, but not me. I want to be in everything your ally or your enemy. You've g0! i! all." beauty, wisedom, skill. Compared with yours, mine are chi/dish desires. I won't be am obstacle to your plans. And if you listen f0 me, I'll make a respectable and rich woman out 0f you. Ag reed. Alright, I'll accept. We'll be partners. But there may come a day when you might regret it. Do you really think so? I wouldn't know, life is full of the unforeseen. You could disappoint me. - Try me. - How? Set your conditions now. - Are you going away? - Yes. Goodbye. Here. The 1,000 /ire. We'll settle the account every month. - Do you want a receipt? - Don't joke about it. Don't worry. You'll be pleased with me. I thank you. I go away almost happy. Almost? Why? For now, it can still wait. I don't understand. You've understood perfectly. Today won't you give me anything else? Not even a kiss? No, never. Go away, I don't want to. Never? After all, this is our destiny. No, let me go, leave! - A kiss. - I'll shout. Do you think we'll be able to resist long side by side, as if made of ice? I'm not asking for anything horrid. Just a kiss to seal our pact. And then you'll go away? I swear. Now go. Go away! You're mad! I have no remorse. I've always liked to defy rules, to challenge the forbidden. And after all, I'm only a half brother. I couldn't give you up for that. What'd you have thought had I gone away? - So it's true. - That he's not my father? They say it, but he doesn't want to admit it That's why he paid all my gambling debts, so they'd think I was his favourite. You may be his favourite. You shou/dn 'I believe [he "they say". People, what do they know of what really is? My parents would have thought me crazy had they known me for what I really was. Since my childhood I've thought... What? Nothing. That I wanted... To make love! ...to be rich. You will be. No, we shall be. - Is it fresh? - Of course! But hurry up, othenuise we'll be soaked! Ferramonti the money lender! Money lender, do you lend me a nickel? Is it over already? If I nab you! Is this an hour for coming back? Everything's cold. You'd say the Last Judgement. We'll all drown. What is this? Have you gone mad? Hello, father. Happy birthday. Who's that one? Irene Ferramonti. I'm happy to be able to speak to you at last. It's your birthday. I don't celebrate birthdays. I wish it to you all the same. Why? Because you matter for me. Yes, sure! Come, go away. - What is this? - She brought it. There never was a man like you, alone like a dog. Especially today. It's an ordinary day. Maybe. But who can do without affection? Affection? What do you want from me? Nothing. Don't worry. I only am demanding with myself. - Why have you let her in? - I insisted. I care about you. I often think about you. About me or my money? There are things more valuable than money. You're all pissed of at the idea of me marrying again! You're wrong father. I'm not your father! Why have you come? What do you want? Tell me! To see you serene. Stay by you, help you. HGlp me? You live and sleep with my moron of a son and you want to help me? There's sometihng else you want! And take care, princess... Your play-acting and your deferences don't impress me. Take this. Your wine seller told me it was the best. I'll come again the day after tomorrow at the same hour. That's how you must cook! It's been ten years since you've been poisoning me! The estate reaches up to those pine-trees there. You can breathe a fresh air here. Let me go... - We'll make it straight to the wine cellar! - Agreed. We'll wait for you there. Have you hurt yourself? Come, sit here. - Is it the ankle? This one? - Yes. Does it hurt badly? You'll see, it's not serious. It's already better, isn't it? Please, Mario... I have to speak to you. Your father wants to marry again. They say solitude runs down on him. He's after the daughter of one of his friends. How do you know that? You had him watched without telling me? I haven't kept anything from you. What will you think? Take care, I don't like being laughed at. How could you think such a thing? I'd think you'd congratulate me. It's in our own ineterst to be on good terms with him. Do you want it to be taken away from us? But it's not yet done. You must trust me. Am I to prove my loyalty to you? Tomorrow morning I'll meet your father for the first time. How did you manage that? Don't ask any questions. Trust me. Welcome, boss. - My ass is mashed! - Please... It's wonderful. Please... Are you bored? Come, spit it out. I've got news from father that won't please us. Is he sick at last? - No, he wants to get married. - What? - Why are you laughing? - It makes me laugh. There's no reason for merriment. Think at the risks. He might find who knows who. It's our duty to defend him. And if we think carefully, he could still have children. It's awful! Who told you? Mario, just now. There may be a way out. - It's one of lrene's ideas. - Speak! Finding him a woman we trust. He's not so easy to be convinced. And how wold we approach him? We couldn't. Me even less. - Then? - There only is your wife. Of course. She hasn't quarrelled with him. She may be able to do it. If you insist. - Much obliged. - Of course! How will you approach him? I don't know. It won't be easy. To be able to do it, I must have free hands. You'll make peace, that's a promise. I've already been succesful with you, haven't I? You haven't eaten? I didn't feel like it. Are you feeling alright? You might need me. Go to the mess! At last! Today you're almost two hours late. I'm sorry I was busy at the shop. Don't you want to kiss me, father? You always smell good. Have you seen? Sun comes with you. The weather's turned fine. What is it? Look. Well! Do you know what? I'll turn into another man. I'm not easy to change. I've already changed Pippo. Pippo was an idiot, which he still is. Don't talk like that about him. I'd like to be able to say good things. You're hurting me, you know that. But it isn't your fault, solitude makes you unfair. It's their fault, if I live like a leper! They all care about you. Money, that's what they want. I'm disgusted you've married Pippo. But what pleases me is, that in this way, we've become relatives. Don't you hope even for a moment you'll bring those three serpents to me! If you go on like this, I'll leave. L! was no! mean! for you, [his is your house. You can come whenever you wish. To tell you the truth, I need someone. Someone f0 fake care 0f me. I couldn't do everything. I already have a husband and the shop. You need a woman who'll live here. A woman who'll love you, a wife. I'm too old for that. It'd be nice to find a woman to warm up my life, and above all, my bed. And young, if possible. I still love doing it, you know? Can I make you a coffee? It's already made. I thought you won't come. Why have you stayed so late this evening? You knew it. You had agreed. Do you think it's easy making him forget this woman? I've had enough of the Ferramontis. It has to stop! We've talked about you. It's your father that started it. He respects you, after all. He says you're a self made man, like he was. It's a good sign. I'll convince him to meet you, one of these days. You're manoeuvring just fine. And what if he'd find out we're lovers? It's a difficult situation for me. Irene, I... I had never happened to me. From now on... There only is you. The other women don't interes me anymore. Flavia must remain your mistress and my friend. We haven't got the right to error. If we're careful, we'll make it. From now on we're accomplices. How I love this word! Thank you. You are wonderful. No, I must leave. He may be at the window. Let me go, he might understand. I don't care, I want to make love here, in his home. It's the only way I can stand him between us. You'll be my downfall if I can't stop needing you. What are you doing here? - I didn't have the keys. - You should have rung. Have you seen? You were at father's? - You're drunk. - Were you at father's? She was at father's. You make me be ashamed. Why, did I do something wrong? Irene, wait... I'm sorry for this delay. I have to do everything by myself around here. But not for long, you'll see. Next year I'll be up for elections. An old dream. And it'll also be thanks to you. I've even got Barbati's support. It's perfect. So, I was telling you about my doubts... We had found a perfect woman for the old man, but Mrs Irene refused to help. And it was her idea, after all. And what if she had another strategy in P/pp0 's advantage ? Of course, she's a woman who knows how to defend her interests. And those famous orders? I've inquired about them, but the state Pippo's in... I had f0 make other decisions. And then? They've gone to others. Flaviana came to see me. When? Didn't you know? She's mad on Irene. They shouldn't see each other again. Have they quarrelled? Why, what has she said? I don't know anymore, she just went on and on. Flaviana has something to say about everything, but in the end... What if she was jealous? Why? On Irene. You do see each other often, don't you? I try helping her to save Pippo. His business wavers. Good, that's very noble of you. You know, people... It's easy to ruin a woman. And lrene's very attached to her respectability. What are you doing? How elegant! Is it a new dress? You've been away since Saturday. You know father has asked me to stay with him. He hasn't been feeling well lately. And you always come home drunk. But what's worse, it's that you've become the laughing stock of the borough. What do you want? Do you have the nerve to ask me that? Do you realise the state the shop is in? We are not growing. One more reason to inquire about those auctions. You've totally ignored it. It's Barbati who's got it. And we, we're stuck with the debts! I've had to pay more than 1,000 /ire in one month. Have you managed this miracle? Yes, it really is a miracle. I can't make any miracles. Then who's done done it? Who? - Your brother. - Good. Tell him I'm soryy I didn't kiss Furlin's or my bitch of a sister's ass. If they despise you, it'll be your own fault. And I've had enough of helping you! Prove me you can change or hang yourself, I won't stop you. Do you think you can go on treating like this much longer? Lately, I've suffered from all the plagues in the world. What are you doing here? Go away... To hell with you! I don't care about money! Go away! Irene, what's happening? What's [he matter with you? Everything's the matter. Calm down. What has happened? Aren't you going to father tonight? He has told me not to come. He'll let me know when I'll be able to return. I don't know why. I think it's Teta's hand. You've underestimated her, she's a real viper. She's capable of everything. She might have talked to the old man. About what? What do you think? She and Paolo suspect us. We should have been wiser, pretend more, see them often. Introduce the woman they have found to father. It'd be better if we'd stay out of it for some time. It's too dangerous. I must make up with Pippo. But I... I can't make, away from you. You'll have to, unfortunatelly. It makes me mad. Everything looked so well, until now. You were to come for me in the evening. Father knew it and was happy. Yes, happy... But he never wanted to see me. Get undressed. Who has come in? - What are you doing here? - You were not expecting me, were you? I wanted to give you back the keys. You'll be more quiet like this. I don't want to talk. Are you getting undressed or the other way round? No domestic scene, you're not in the position. The same goes for you. I know who's in your bed. I '/71 sorry for you, Irene, you haven 'I understood an yfhing. You should know them better than I do, the Ferramontis. Farewel. Princess! You've come back. How come? Come. No, not at my place. I want to go to my father. At your moron of a father-in-law. I want to show him to what his daghter-in-law has brought me to! To what his angelical daughter-in-law has brought me to! Slut! I'm going to the pub... But where are you going? Where the hell are you going? - Shut up, or I'll leave. - Go! Wait a minute. Don't leave me here. Help me. I'm going insane... Do you believe me? D0 you like your room ? It's wonde/ful. You've changed everything. Why are you laughing? Is it because of the new dress? I'm laughing of myself. From when you've forbidden me to come, I've been torturing myself for days to understand how had I offended you. Idiot! Where did you get these ideas from? On the contrary, I've thought a lot about you. You wanted to make another man out of me? It seems you're on the right track. What can I do for you? What more could you do? I '/71 happy as i! is. Do you know that today I've loaned someone 100 /ire... without asking for guaranties? I'm sorry, I fell asleep. It's ready. Are you coming? Yes. My shoulder. - Show me. - It's nothing. - Come on... - If I tell you it's nothing. I'm embarassed. Why? Aren't you? Here? A little higher. Here? In the back also. It's better. I'm sorry. Go. Please, excuse me. What for, my God? For loving me? - You're like a father to me. - Leave me alone. She won't see anyone, the tramp! My jacket! Home, shop and father's! I bet you the old man has already made peace with Pippo. That's all that was missing! After all we've done for him. As a matter of fact, Irene has sent me all the money she owed me. I'm not Mario. I can't be wheedled like that. But father, can! I've summed everything up. 35,000, the house in Trasfevere. 15,000, the one in Pellegrino st. 1,000 /ire the estate in the countryside... And the bonds, the deposits and the gold. If Irene hoodwinks him, he'll leave everything to Pippo and we are done for. I can't allow this kind of a scandal. The carnival charriofs are already out? Would you like to disguise yourself? I don't know. I dind't do it even as a little girl. I don't like the idea too much. Don't go to bed too late. I'll finish this accounts. I'll go to sleep. Good night. Come in. Excuse me. I dind't want to... I thought it was only normal for you to have fun at the carnival. You're young, don't stay here to go moldy. Go party. I haven't got a costume. That's not a problem. I'll buy one for you. Will you accompany me to the ball? Would you like dancing with a bear like me? Ask Mario to accompany you. That, at least, he'll know how to do. Good night. Irene, are you ready? You were born in Napoleon's court. I don't know if I'll dare show myself to your friends. Why's that? You're so beautiful you'll make them all go crazy. Let's go, or we'll be late. Just a moment. Take of your cape first. Wait... Not now. I've come at the right moment. Go on... Pretend I wasn't here. Jesus, what a dress! The costume was my idea. This is what being a man of taste means. What a getup! Are you out of your minds? Father has asked me to go with her to the ball. Come. Why? Are you running away? You know it, I'd accept anything. I want you to have fun, you, father, Mario... But I also. I also want you. You were doing what? Like this? Leave her alone! I'm not going to crease, your nice masked woman. Go to sleep. I'm not creasing... my wife. How do you feel? Alright. It's over. Listen. Before going to the ball, I have to stop and see father. So the old man can admire you. I figured that out. I've promissed him. Then we'll go to your place. I want to sleep with you. Will they come? Of course the'll come. They might be somewhere near. Look, the Barbatis. She loves having fun, Flaviana does. Yes, she loves dancing. She hasn't come. She will. That pimp of brother of mine we'll surely bring her. He has never missed one single ball! If he's shrewd, he won't show up with her. What's the matter? I'm tired, father. Come sit down. Tell me, what is it? I'm sad, father. Why? Have you had enough being with me? With you, I feel protected. There's so much meanness all around. - What do you mean? - I feel like going away. Going away? What will I become without you? I've at last found happiness, a! [he sunset 0f m y life, and I refuse f0 let i! g0. I'll show you something. Inside this safe, there's a letter concerning you. Me? My last wishes. A testament. When I die... Please. Don't speak about those things. I intend living for a long time still. But I wanted to take some measures. My testament says I'm leaving everything to you. You have three children! I have no one. I only have you. But you must promise me you'll enjoy the money. You must do what I never did. - I... - Have fun! What will you do with so much money? And now... Go, I don't want to see you sad anymore. Understood? My God! Is she mad? Let her sink deeper. - Who's that? - Irene Ferramonti. Kiss me. Come. Forgive me, Mario. Why this gayness? I was hoping for the first dance. Let me do as I wish. It's a special evening. - Why? - I'll tell you... or not. What are you hiding from me? What has my father told you? Nothing. He just complimented me on my costume. - How is it going? - Fine. Long time since we haven't seen each other! My fault! I'm so busy! Pippo, the house, the shop... - And especial/y father. - That's s0. Bu! we also... business, politics... Mario mus! have fold you. Of course. He tel/s me everything. Isn't Tefa here? She was looking for you. Here she is. I was wondering if it was you or Messaline! You're making everybody's head turn! Come in! It's the only way of talking to you, bitch! Shouldn't you have reconcilled us with father? I don't want to see you anymore, understood? I/l/ifch, I be! you're setting him up against us. You want t0 split the cake with P/pp0, Mario 0r both 0f them? Enough! I don't want to hear you anymore. Then, g0. G0 dance! Tomorrow I'll go to my father and I'll tell him everything: Mario and you, your schemes, your opinions on the inheritance... What do you have f0 say? You can take off your mask, it's useless now! He'll never believe you. I've got proofs of your relationship with Mario. You'll even go to jail. Pack up, it's over for you. You can kiss goodbye the Ferramonti inheritance! - Let's go! - But... Take me away! It's not possible... I've sacrificed myself, I've accepted everything... I'm not giving up. How should I put it? I couldn't care less about my father, the inheritance, everything... Let them go to hell. Let's go. I'm not giving up. They won't win. I now what I have to do. No, you're leaving with me tonight. I'm not sharing you with anyone anymore. Have you got that? What do you want? Let me go! I don't love you. I married your brother for your father's money. I brought you all together so that I could deceive you more easily. I can't even brag about doing something difficult. You don't even know how to hate. If you'd done to me one hundredth, one thousandth of what I did to you, I'd have destroyed you already And you ask me to runaway with you. You're right. I should hate you, but I can't. Farewel. What an imbecil I am. I only feel good here. Do you really want to spend your carnival here? Yes, with you. You know, somebody has knocked on the door, a few moments ago. I opened up, but there was no one. Only a letter. A letter for me. I'll show it to you. Read it. Then I'll read it. "You're an old imbecil. Irene sleeps with Mario and Pippo drinks so he doesn't see. Mario hasn't got a dime left. Don't trust Irene... if you don't want to go to your ruin. She only wants your money." My God! How mean can people be! They can defame, slander, just out of envy. And maybe you believe them. Don't you? Come here, let's talk a little. Listen. I only want to know... if it's true what you did to them. Have you slept with Mario? My God! Have you believed that? Please, tell me if it's true or not. I don't want to see you anymore, I'm leaving. You'll never see me again! Don't even joke about it. Forgive me. Cursed letter! Calm down. All my life, I've pilled up money, and only had troubles. Maybe I'll just leave everything to the priests, to the pooors, and the nuns! God knows that would relieve me. I've never thought money important. Only people matter, sentiments. For me, there is only you that counts. I swear... I've always tried seeing you like a daughter. I couldn't allow myself to... But when.. Do you still want me? Yes. From the first time you came. Do you want a little trumpet? Nut! - What? - Nothing. You're laughing... What an idiot I am. I've thrown years away and now here I am counting minutes. Why minutes? You have a whole life in front of you. I had a funny dream. Tell me. I'd like to know what it means. If by chance... Anyway, I was opening the door... That door, there, but it was made of glass. I was entering and seeing my three children sitting on these chairs. Without moving. They were covered in ice. I was here. And suddenly, I saw myself covered in ice, like them. Was I here? You're not in nightmares. You're a dream. Oh my Lord, what a wonderful day! Shall we take a ride in the coach? If you want to. My God how beautiful you are! If you knew what I'm craving for. Come We must be strong. Have guts. You haven't lost your father. Irene is right. We must be strong. We must now think to the big interests who'll soon come to term. It's urgent. Pippo, come see your old man. Courage. I know he has left no testament. If we act quickly, and with one voice, we'll save the inheritance taxes for the deposits. We're talking about 2,358,000 /ire. For the real estate, the Trasfevere house, the bonds and all the rest, we'll see later. You're well informed. But there's one thing you don't kow. Father has left me everything. What? What's this nonsense? What do you mean? The money belongs to me. Father has given me a letter. Everything's there. Sow! You've cheated us. Even me. I knew you were good, bu! here you've surpassed yourself All your schemes won't serve to anything. What do you want? Nothing. Don't worry. I don't want anything from you. It's better like this, believe me. - Loving you was my mistake. - Are you through? No, and you must listen to me. I don't hold a grudge. That's how you are. That's how you were made. And l... have liked you as you were. But now... what am I to do? You've judged me wrong. Don'! you know where money fakes you? You'll always be more greedy and desperate. I should kill you. But I'll make you a present. The best you've ever got. Coward! This suicide will cost you dearly. This death will haunt you for all your life. Nobody will believe you in court. He who has [he world with him wins. You've done it! The law suit took place. The scandal mongers had their feast. I drowned in hostility, nobody defended me, no! one woro'. I was depicted in that court 8S 8 ITTOIISIIUOUS WOITTEII. Who could have doubted Mario had killed himself? And f0 [he eyes 0f everyone, I had even poisoned [he old man. I was expecting f0 be arrested. I dind'! understand wh y [he Fur/ins saved me from that. In their place, I'd have done if. The final sentence was given 0n [he 5th 0f December 1885 The act dec/airing me [he heir was annu/ed. Pippo had died a! [he asylum crying my name. The tribunal declared MP F ur/in and his wife Tefa universal heirs." To respectable mediocrities Furlin had been right." "He who has the world with him, wins. "
