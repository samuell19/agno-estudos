All right. But don't be mad. Forget it, Dee. I guess maybe we've had enough kissing for tonight. Okay? All right. See you tomorrow morning. Deanie, has Bud left? Yes, ma'am. It's wonderful news tonight. The Stanford oil stocks have gone up 14 points. Now, you just think of that, honey. That means if we sold our stocks now, we would make $15,000. Take your milk. And then maybe we could send you away to college next year. But we are not going to sell them because your father says that everyone at the Elk says the stocks are going up even higher now. Did Bud say anything about it tonight? He doesn't know anything about his father's business, mama. What are you and Bud doing all this time, for heaven's sake? Studying. Now, you listen to me. Bud Stamper could get you into a lot of trouble. Now, you know what I mean. Boys don't respect a girl they could go all the way with. Boys want a nice girl for a wife. You and Bud haven't gone too far already, have you? No, mom. Tell me the truth, Rumadine. We haven't gone too far. Mama, is it so terrible to have those feelings about a boy? No nice girl does. Doesn't she? No nice girl. Didn't you ever feel that way about Papa? Your father never laid a hand on me until after we were married. And then I just gave in because a wife has, too. Women don't enjoy those things the way a man does. They don't? No. Really, Mama. I only let your father come near me in order to have children. But's Troubling, you will. A dean Nothing. I'm just tired. You make Bud bring you home earlier after this. Especially on school nights. Any night. And don't let the bedbug fight. I want to talk to you. Want to talk to you soon. Kind of late ours for a boy keeping basketball training, isn't it? You're the captain of the team that'll tell us look up to you. You got to run with the ball. I wasn't much older than you when I fell off the crown block, hit the rig floor. My running days were over. You're running for both of us now. Brought in a new well today. Oh, yeah? Yes, sir. It's flowing over 100 barrels an hour. Wow, that's great. Yes... our stock is going to go up. Those big Eastern companies are beginning to take notice of us now. And they're beginning to sit up and take notice. You been out with a little Loomis girl. Now you're watching yourself with her, aren't your, son? Oh, yeah. Not going to do anything you're going to feel sorry for her now, are you? No. She's a nice girl. See, I've gone her folks ever since well, they're loomis and I were boys together. See, I've got nothing against them, son, because they're poor. I'm not snob or anything like that. Only difference in him and me is I've got ambition. But if you get that girl in trouble, you're going to have to marry it. Now, you realize it? - Yeah. - You understand that? I mean, you get a girl in trouble and you have got to pay the consequence. Don't you know that? Get your dupe, sucker. Get them up. Get in here. Get past it. Get past it. You know, watch this one. It's coming at it. It's coming at your boy. We got a big future, son, you and I. First, I'm going to see that you get an education. The best. Four years in jail. Yeah, that's what I want to talk to you about. You a secret point. It's a secret sign. Our company is going to merge with one of those big Eastern companies. Now, I'm going to put you in there. I'm putting you in there. I got a big future line right up for you, son. There's nothing in the world that I will not do for you if you do right. Don't disappoint me now, okay? Don't disappoint me. God knows I've had enough disappointment with your sister. You should have seen that girl when she got out the train tonight. God, what a mess. Sister's back? You didn't tell me. Oh, yeah. She got in from Chicago a little while ago. That's great. Wait a minute. She's asleep. Just let her sleep. You'll see her in the morning. Where are you going? Got to get your rest, don't you? Man's in training. In training. Come on. I got all my hopes pinned on you now. - Okay - Okeay. -Get the marriage. All right. All my hopes, boy. Okay. Roll that ball. Okay, man. How are we doing in here? Well, I spoiled her. I spoiled that girl after your mother died. First I sent her off to a finishing school. She broke all the rules, so they kicked her off and I let her go off to university. She went hog wild, fluck to all of her courses. Of course, I had to learn my lesson all over again. So I let her go off to a wild place like Chicago to study art. Son, she got mixed up with some cake eater who got her in trouble so he could marry her. Yeah, but your lawyer got her knoll, didn't he? Your damn Ryder got it annulled. When Mr Cake Eater found out I was going to cut off her allowance, he backed out in a hurry. But this year I'm going to keep her home and teach her some discipline. You're not going to keep your thumb on jeans. Welcome home, miss Virgnia. Somebody well. I am been there. My baby brother. God, good to see you. He thinks he's going to make me stay home a whole year to punish me. There's old schools left It'll take her. Daddy, if you think I'm going to stay home and this god forsaken Tange, you better think again. I'm going to California and live with Amp Blossom and study art. - Art who ? - I hated here. I'm a freak in this town. People look at me on the street like I was out of a carnival. Well, that's because you peroxide your hair and you paint your face like a hussey. Mom wore makeup, too. There's nothing wrong with wearing makeup. Yeah, she wore respectively. She wasn't blatantly anything after you got through with her. I'm not going to put over that kind of talk in his house. Stop defending her. He loves me. He also's going to defend me. Listen, I'm going to be waiting for school. More coffee, Phoebe? Heads up. Give me a bite. Hi, Bud. Hi, Juanita. So funny. I don't know why, but you always make me smile. What happened to his thumb? Or just playing basketball? This is supposed to be practice. You all right to it? Yeah. What's the matter with you? But I feel like a wild man all day. You better hit the showers. Go on. Go on down. Why don't you stand around and get back to work? None of your business. Knows what it's all about, having to look twice with those other girls anymore. Take them out and spend good money on them and they expect you to be satisfied when they kiss you good night. Hi, Bud. How Anita? Go on, Deanie, I'll be right with you. Getting better. Anytime you need a nurse, you just call on me. Bye. - What was that all about? - What? I suppose you wish I were more like Juanita. What am I supposed to do? Not even notice that girls like that even exist? Is that what you expected me not to even notice that girls like that even exist? Bud I'm sorry. Mom! Mom! You'Re crazy about me, aren't you? Crazy about me. Admit it. Say it. Say it. Down on your knees before I don't. Tell me you can't live without me. You're hurting me. Just tell me you can't live without me and that you love me. I'll say it. I do. You do what? I do love you. I can't live without you. And you do anything I ask you to. Anything at all. Anything. I didn't mean to hurt you. I was only kidding. Look, I'm the one that should be down on my knees before you. But I just can't get about these things because I am nuts about you. And I would go down on my knees don't worship you if you really wanted me to and I just can't live without you. But I wouldn't do anything you asked me to. Really, I would. Anything. Quick, Henry. A flip. Hill. Practice. Listen, dad, I want to talk to you about something. I did. I had all the nonsense I ain't paid to take. Get out of here, girl. I want to talk to my beloved. All right, son. All right. I'm going to marry Deanie. Sorry. Just listen to me, dad. I really don't want to go to Yale. I mean, I'm not a good student. What do you mean you're not a good student? You can do anything you set your mind to, anything at all. If anything, I'd rather have a few years of agricultural college. If you want to know the truth, that's what I would like to do. And then I could come back here and take over the ranch of south of town. Ranch is no kind of a life. And then I could marry Deanie, and we could go off to college together. I mean, she'd be a big help to me. I spent my life trying to create a place of importance for you, son. Now you're coming to me and you say, I don't want to go to college. No, I want to marry. I want to... Dad, Isn't it what I want that counts? Son, of boy your age doesn't know what he wants. Just trust me this time. Dad Look, it's not a matter of trust. I trust you. You know that. I trust you more than anybody else in the world. It's just if I go to Call. Son, I told you, I can't take any more disappointment. Look, dad, I don't want to disappoint you. I just want to marry Deanie. I understand, sir. I do. Both going crazy. I understand. Your old man understand. I think what you need right now is a different kind of a girl. Just for the time being. See, when I was a boy, there's always two kinds of girls we boys never talked about on the same breath. But every once in a while, one of us would just kind of just slip off with one of those girls that were easy and get it out of his son. No other girl looks good to me except for Deanie. You want to marry Deanie, that's it. I understand, son. She's a nice girl. I mean, I love her and she loves me. And you want to marry her and you want to have a family, right? That means you're going to need some security. Can't raise kids on love alone. Now, ranching is kind of a risky business. If one tab gets a disease, you can lose them all. You know what happened to your Uncle Charlie? Your Uncle Charlie had a heifer get hoof and mountain. He lost nearly his whole herd. But hadn't been for my charitable soul, his whole family would have starved that winter. All I am asking you, son, is you get a college education, then you're you will have a choice. Then you'll have a choice. And after four years at Gail, you still want to marry the little Loomis girl, I'm going to give you both my blessing, and I'll send you on a honeymoon trip to Europe. Let go for a minute, Deanie. I'm going to have to go to Yale. It's not that I want to go to Yale. It's that I think I need a college education. Just in case the whole ranching thing doesn't work out. You gave in. This isn't you talking. This is your father. All right, I admitted I told him I'd try college. Four years, Bud. I mean, what am I supposed to do for four years? Look, if you can't wait, then don't. But don't be mad... please. I'll wait, Bud. I will. I'll wait forever. Papa, look. Isn't it the most beautiful thing you ever saw? Oh, that's really nice, baby. Oh, wonder how much Bud paid for that. Between 80 and $90, wouldn't you say, Dell? Mom, I don't see why you always have to think of what things cost. Well, if you want to know the truth, I wish it cost a little less and was a ring. For four years, you are going to... - Don't mom. - Always drink any of milk, Dean? All right. I just wish Bud Stamper had a little more gumption. Go on, Deanie. Get ready for church. Come on, get dressed. Hurry up. I don't see why I couldn't have a car. Why in the hell should I get you a car, huh? And you can drive that coop around. That coop is a wreck and you know it. What, did the girl give you something? Bad, she named herself. What are you done to your hair? I just put a hand of rings on. Looks like a circuit clamp. Thank you. I'll get it. Look at this, dad. She even decorated the papers. Guess you couldn't afford a regular present, son. All right, all right Right now. Come on, ladies. I don't know. Bud Where is she? Happy New Year, everybody. What's the matter with everybody? Come on, Daddy. Let's dance. So glad you could come. Thank heaven. Come on, dance with me. I love you. I love you. Jimmy got to take you away from here. No, you can tell him. I'm going to stay here. You know what? You're pretty. Sam. No, you don't have to dance. I want to dance with you. Of course not. Every day I get to dance with you. Sure, my brother you wouldn't come near me. It's not true. Nice boys. I don't know what all you nice boys are like. The only place they'll come near me now is in the dark. In a dark automobile all day. Bud. - You love me? - Yes? Leave me alone. Please leave me alone. Let's get out here. Okay. - Where? - Anywhere. - Okay? - Okay. Happy new year. - Did you see where Glenn went? - No. What's mad aka he got stood up? Looks like it. Oh, but would you be an angel? I'll love you for the rest of my life. The rest of your life, huh? Sure. I'll go look for. I'll be right back. Guess I should have expected something like this from a college boy. - Glenn. - Over here. You know, your date is waiting for you inside. She can wait. There's nothing more interesting going on here. There's a girl in that car. Get out of here. Get out of here. Hey fella, wake. Your turn. But what would happen. This is driving me crazy. I mean, I want you so much. But I couldn't live without you. But I'm afraid of what I'm going to do. I'm afraid I might hurt you or I might do something. Oh, Bud. No. Listen to me, Deanie. I think we're going to have to stop seeing each other for a while. I think it would be better for you and I think it would be better for me. - Please, please... - Deanie. I got to go. But please don't leave me. No, Deanie. It's over. No more. Put him on that table there. Come on, back it off. Back it off. Put them down. Come on. Rusty, grab some towels. Where's the dock? Take it in here. Come on, give them some room. You guys, get out of here. Come on, all you guys, out of here. Let's move it. We don't know yet, Dean. We're going to take him to the hospital. Sorry. How is he? Done. Come on, guys. Air. Move it. He's unconscious. I think he's probably got a concussion. I call the ambulance. I don't think it's that bad, though. This will burn a little bit now. You're pretty lucky. You weren't hurt that seriously. I got a hard head. You sure do. You go with Dell Loomis's girl, don't you? She's a mighty attractive girl. She is. - See her every night. - Do you use them? Look, Doc, I'm nuts about Deanie. I don't blame you. I love her and she loves me. But it's no fun being in love. It hurts sometimes. I have to remember, you know what I mean? When I hold her and kiss her and stuff. And then I got to go home. I mean, it's enough to drive a guy nuts. My dad says I should find some other kind of girl. No, no... But when you don't want any other kind of girl... I don't know. Bud. You're with a nice girl. You do know what you're doing. But we have all been through what you're going through so. We'Ve all had. To deal with the same problem. I mean, it's enough to drive anybody crazy, right? If you let it. Look, why don't you come back in on Friday for a final check, okay? - Sure enough. - All right. Bye bye. Just leave the door open, okay? What so the radiance which was once so bright has vanished now forever from my sight. Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower we grieve not rather find strength in what remains behind. Now, what do you suppose the poet meant by these lines? Deany Loomis? I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf. I didn't hear the question. Deanie, I know it's spring, but pay attention. Pay attention. Yes, Ms. Miss Metcalf. Deanie, I just recited some lines from Words Worth Odes on Intimations of Immortality. Did you hear them? No. Then I would ask you, please, to get out your book. Read those lines to me. Please. Stand. Stand up. Yes. Stand up. So nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower. We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind. Now, perhaps you can tell us exactly what the poet had in mind with the expression slender in the grass, glory in the flower. What it means. Yes, Dean, what does it mean? It has some reference, I think. When we're young, we look at things idealistically. - The author - wordsworth? Yes, wordsworth. He means when we grow up... Denny. Are you all right? We have to forget the ideals of youth and find the strength. Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie. There now you eat a good of dinner, honey. Could you pass me the beans, mama? You have some bread. Mama. 76 and a half. 76 and a half. Stamper Oil is 76 and a half. 76 and a half. Del... we are rich. Del...we are rich. We are going to send you to college and we are going to buy a new car. Del... I bet the Stamper family is feeling good these days. I saw a young Stamper driving down the street this afternoon in his family's car. And Del... brand new. Feeling better, dear? Yes. There's nothing like a good soaking. Tell me, Deanie, what has been the matter these last few days? I'm sorry I troubled you. I don't want to worry anyone. I don't want to worry you. Is it all on account of because of Bud? Because he doesn't call for you anymore? I don't know. What? I don't know. I have a good mind to call him and tell him what I think. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. - Don't you dare, you hear me? - I will. Deanie. Denie, I was only joking. Deanie, how serious has it become between you and Bud? Well, you know what I mean. Had anything serious happen? Did he spoil you, Deanie? Spoil? Did he spoil me? No, I'm not spoiled. No, I'm just as fresh and virginal as the day I was born. Oh, I'm a lovely virginal creature who wouldn't think of being spoiled. Okay. I've been a good little girl. A good little girl. A good little girl. A good little girl. I've always done everything that daddy, mommy told me. I've obeyed every word. I hate you. I hate you. Deanie! We should take her to Wichita like Doc Smiley suggested. It'll take money, but I can sell those stocks now. Oh, Del, I can't think it's that serious. She's bound to get over it in just a little more time. There has never been any mental trouble in either of our families. Hi folks. My name is Alan Tuttley. Call me Tutt. Oh yes, I've heard Deany speak of you. How do you do? I just thought I'd stop by and say hello to Deanie. - Hi Tuk. - Hi Denny. How are you feeling, Deanie? Fine. Well, if you young people will pardon us. We'll supper is almost ready. Nice to have met you folks. Deanie, what did you do to your hair? Nice to meet you too. I was talking to Bud and you said you two weren't seeing each other anymore. All right. Stop by and see how you're doing. Thank you, Ted. You look fine. Thank you, Ted. I was wondering well if you'd like to go to the dance with me? I think it'd be an awful drip at the dance, Toots. Why don't you say you'll go and if something comes up in the meantime, if you change your mind or you don't feel like it. Can you open the door for me, Ted? Don't you stay out too late. Don't worry, Mrs. Loomis. I'll take good care of her. Did you hear that? Don't stay out too late. She said that ever since I was being high. But it doesn't mean the thing. Let's go. Hi, Mr. Johnson. Hi. Hi, Denny. Don't you look pretty. Got a great one, Buddy. Pretty. I love your drink. Hi, Laurie. Hi, Dean. Hi, Deenie. Hi. - God, it's good to see you - Great. Who are you here with? Davy. Guess who's here. Guess who with... Kay. You are still crazy about Davy. Admit it. You only ask David. Hi, Dean. Dance with me, too. Okay with you, Deanie? What? Oh, sure. Hi, Deanie. You look... gorgeous How you been? All right, I guess. I don't know. How about you? Pretty good. All right. I don't know either. But let's aside for a cigarette. When did you start smoking? All the last few weeks. Bud... I know why you quit coming by. Come on, Deanny, let's not talk about that. No, I have to talk about it, Bud. Dean, I've missed you. I mean, every night after dinner. It's all I could do to keep from calling you. But I mean, I've missed you. I mean, I think about you all the time. But I just can't start seeing you again. Not the way we have been. To want you and not be able to have you. I mean, it's hard on me, Dean, wanting you so much. Bud... I've changed. I'm not so stupid anymore. I know why you started seeing Juanita Howard. Juanita means nothing to me. Nothing. I mean, I was maybe with Juanita maybe a couple of times and she meant nothing. I can do anything. She can do it's a lot better, too. Come on, Deanny. Cut it out now. Come on. - Now... Right now. - Deanie, you're a nice girl. No, I'm not. I'm not a nice girl. - Here Bud now, please. - Deanie, this is not you. Come on. It's like you've lost your pride. Come on. My pride? My pride? I don't have any pride. I don't have any pride at all. - No, I haven't any pride. - Cut it out. Just cut it out. I don't have a surprise. I just want to die. I just want to die. Deanie!... Deanie! Take me away from here, please. Okay. Take me away. I've been wanting you for a long time. Deanie. It's not Bud. Deanie's. It's not Bud. Bud gone. - No.. no.... - No more Bud. No... no... no. Deanie... Deanie! Deanie! Deanie! Dee, where are you going? Up there. Deanie! Deanie stop. - Is she all right? - We don't know yet, dad. Frieda. Del, I'm sorry about this. Now I'm afraid to get Deanie in very nervous condition. I want to see my baby. Duck, can I see my baby? Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow. I want to see my baby. Del, have you thought any more about what we discussed? Yes. I'm going through with it. Del! God darn it. I'm going to sell those stocks and send girl to that sanatorium in Wichita. Just as soon as she's able to leave here, I'm going to make some arrangements. All right? Now, Mama, I think it's time you and I were home in bed. Anything, but I can do anything. Let me know. Thanks. - Hi Bud. - Hi. Mr. Loomis. Look, Doc, I don't care what he says. I'm going to marry Deanie. I mean, I'm 18, and that's the legal limited in the state and I can do whatever I want to do. And I'm going to marry Deanie. But I'm afraid that Deanie is not going to be able to marry anybody for quite some time. What do you mean? Tell him doc. Tell me what? But I'm afraid Deanie proved a little unstable. Unstable, Son. Unstable? What do you mean, unstable? Our folks are going to send her to a hospital in Wichita. Wichita? My guess is that she's going to be there for quite some time. See, she's just not the girl for you. No.... Bud no! You don't want to entertain yourself a girl that's going to be unstable overnight. Tell her no. It's okay. I love you, Deanie. I love you so much. She can't hear you. Come on, Bud. She can't hear you. What makes you like that? You want to really help Deanie? Stay away from her. Stay away from what do you mean? Stay away from her? For how long? I don't know. I don't know now. Nobody does. Hi, Bud. You got another letter from your father. At least read your father's letter, Bud. You haven't seen him since your sister's funeral, and that was two months ago. Look, Bud, if you don't snap out of it, they're going to throw you out of school. Johnny. Come in. Come in. Look at that. Just squint your eyes a little bit. What do you think? What would Cézanne say? That's great, Deanie. I never thought I could do this well. Really. No. Six months and you've really honed your skills. I like metalwork, though. You can get rid of a lot of hostilities this way. Watch. Wham. Wham. Every time I pound, I tell myself it's my old man. See, my old man, now he had his heart set on my being a surgeon. No, not a surgeon, but the greatest surgeon who ever lived. Anyhow, I couldn't make that first cut. That first cut into another man's body. I couldn't keep my hands steady, firm. I don't know. You can still be an MD. When you get out. - Yeah, if I ever do get out. - Don't say that. No, seriously. Look... steady is a ship's deck and a storm. Another brew? Oh, no, I can't give you any more. But let me bring you some food, huh? Would you like something to eat? No. Mama's making pizza in the kitchen. Would you like some? Pizza? What's pizza? You don't know what pizza is? Where are you from? Kansas. I'm from Kansas. Well, is it nice out there in Kansas. It's friendly. Everybody knows your name. You know everybody else's name. It's not like you. Well, why don't you go back to Kansas? You must have a sweetheart back there. I did have a sweetheart back there. Hey, come into the kitchen with me and Mama will give you some pizza. Come on. Okay. Today Friday, October 25. Drama on Wall Street continues. Several suicides have been reported. People jumping out of windows. It's been the worst financial disaster in American history. Headlines are calling it Black Friday. Suppose you tell us what you think is the matter, Bud. Have you really been interested in your studies here at Yale? Well, no, I haven't been in interested. What's that got to do anything? I just sent you here to make your grades and graduate. Listen, I disappointed you. Why don't we talk a little Turk here, son, Okay? Why don't you tell us what's really been on your mind? Why don't you tell us what's been taking up your time, your energy. There for a long distance call from New York for Mr. Stanford. It's urgent. - Working a tape. - Right this way. I'm sorry I disappointed him. I'm sorry I've disappointed the school. But is there anything you'd rather be doing than going to school here? Well, to tell you the truth, theme polar, I don't really want to do anything but ranch, but dad has other plans for me. I have never held to the opinion that everyone should go to college. Maybe you could talk to him. Well, I'll try, but he's not a very good listener, really, is he? No, but he's a great guy, though. I've got to get back to New York, but why don't you let me talk to your father? - Sure. -Thank you. Dean Pollard. What's wrong with people, Dean Pollard? What do you mean? Back in New York? To jumping out of windows. Everybody there's quitting. Everything's going to be back to normal just a few days. You really think so? Oh, yes, I do. It's got to. Just got to. Ask for this boy. I want to take him to New York with me this weekend. But I'll have him back here ready to go to work Brighton early on Monday morning. I must say, Mr. Stamper, I do not feel that he should remain here at school. Don't you give up on him now. Please. Please, dean Polar. Don't you give up on that boy. Now, I've been through this with him before, you see. He falls in love with a little girl and that's all he can think of. I don't think that's it. I think that's it. I think that's it. I think I've known that boy a little bit longer, a little bit better than you have, and I think that's it. I had to break up something like this once before see. I'm going to have to do it again. But he will be back here Monday morning ready to go to work. Friday. Don't you read the headline? Mean I've never been able to make with son. I've never been able to make this point with you. A man is his life at a certain time, at a certain place and man works for what's most important at that time in that place. But the things I wanted to you are the best things that I can imagine in life. See that? Maybe I didn't do the right thing by Deanie. No.... Maibye, I did son. I am sorry. Sorrry... I am sorry. Look, look there. Look. Wait a minute. Look at that. It looks like anything she's just saying. But you've never been fair. - You remember, I did all that for you. - I know you did. I did all of it for you. And I you think? Would you like to be married to that girl right now? She's in an institution. Would you like it? But there she is, just as pretty. Look. Just don't look just as pretty. You see her? You see? You want that? You want her? You want her? I'll get her for you. Let me get my money. Hello. Are you, Bud? Why are you going? You invite me in. I worked hard. I worked late. That's the way I decided to live my life. Now, get this down. Are you getting it down? Yes, I am. I've not lost faith in you, son. It's you I rely on, where I failed. You will make good. Succeed. Succeed. Did you get it? You didn't get it? I didn't get it. Mr. Stamper... We'll be home soon. For the first time in two years. And six months, early to the day. How do you feel about going home? It's like going to a foreign country. Dr. Jen, John has asked me to marry him. He waited until now to tell me. Well, are you going to accept? I don't know. You love him? I think so. It's different from the way I felt about Bud. Yes, I love him. Well, I don't see any reason why the two of you shouldn't have a very happy future. Doud's back in Cincinnati now, practicing medicine. - Getting along very well. - I know. I hear from him every day. My taxi. I better go. Are you going to see Bud when you go home? I don't know. Genie, do you think you're going to be very happy married to John if you still don't know how you feel about the other young man? All right, Dr. John. I'll see you. Bye. Why, you couldn't have married a boy from here. You're not going to be much company from me living back east in Cincinnati. What do you know about this young man you're married? After all, you met him at a mental hospital. Are you sure he's all right? Mother, I was in the hospital, too. Oh, well, that was different. You would just run down Deanie. That was the only thing that mattered with you. No, Mama, that was not the only thing that mattered with me. Deanie, did those doctors at the hospital say your mother raised you wrong or something? Did they blame your father and me in any way? I don't blame anyone, Mama. Well, I raised you the only way I knew how. The only way I knew how. And if I brought you up wrong, I don't think you should hate me. I don't hate you, Mama. Well, I used to hate my mother at times but I always believed that she was right about things. Maybe she wasn't, but I loved her. I love you, Mama. I hope so, Deanie. Mama... is he married? Who? Oh, to tell you the truth, I don't know, Deanie. But you needn't be afraid of running into him. Maybe he's living with his uncle Charlie in Tulsa. The Stampers are almost extinct in this town now. Deanie! Someone is asking for you. On this page. I'll be back in 1 minute. There's just one thing. - Keep her away from blood Stamper. - Oh Mrs Loomis. - She's what? I know about this. - No, she hasn't. I thought the years away she'd forget about him but evidently she hasn't. Now, I want you to promise me. The doctor said she's perfectly all right, but there's no use taking chances. Just keep her away from Bud. She really looks beautiful, Mrs. Loomis. I just really missed her. Here's our girl. Beautiful. Well, let's go, June. Hazel I want to see Bud. Deanie now, you just forget about him. I don't even know where he is now, Deanie. I mean, nobody ever sees him. Do you know where he is? Hazel no. He's staying out at his father's old ranch. Let's go. Do you want me to go find Bud? Hi Bud. Hazel. - Hi. - Hi. Cheaper. You're a mess. Yeah, well, you know what been working. I got about 40 head of cattle now and families begin to deal a little more regularly. Deanie's here. She's out by the car. She wants to see you. How is she, Hazel? She's fine. Hi, Deanie. Hello Bud. Hey. Would you like to meet my family? Of course. Come on. She didn't even know he was married. Why didn't you tell her? You're her best friend. I couldn't. I just couldn't. Angie! Yes Bud? Angie got somebody here I want you to meet. Angelina. This is Deanie. How do you do? Hello, Angelina. Won't you come in, please? I'm sorry the house isn't much, but I offer you some wine. No, thank you. I can't stay. And this is Bud Jr. Please come here. Come on. Hello, Bud Jr. We're expecting another to help soon. I hope it's a girl. I better go. You come back up here. Come sometime for dinner. Thank you. Bye. I'll be right back. Don't cry buddy. I married Angelina after I left Newhaven. I didn't finish my first year there. She was real nice. She was pretty wonderful to me when things began to go wrong with the family. You're happy, Bud? I guess so. I really don't ask myself that question very often, though. How about you? I'm getting married next month. You are? My boyfriend is from Cincinnati. I think you might like him. Isn't it funny the way things work out sometimes? Yeah, sure. I hope you'll be very happy, Deanie. Like you, Bud. Happiness isn't something I think about very often. What's the point? You got to take what comes. I just wanted to say that... it's awfully good to see you again. Thanks. Bye June. Hazel. Do you think you still love him? Nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flowers. We shall grieve not. Rather find strength in what remains behind .
