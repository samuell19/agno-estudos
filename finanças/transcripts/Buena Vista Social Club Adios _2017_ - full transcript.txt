It is with deep sorrow and sympathy that I must inform our country that today, the Commander in Chief of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz has passed away. To honour Fidel Castro's death, Cuba declares nine days of national mourning. - Compay Segundo came here? - Compay Segundo never came here. - He never came here? - Well, Compay Segundo was near 60th. They told him: Buena Vista Social Club is that way. - And he went that way? - Yes. That came out in a documentary. He never came to Buena Vista Social Club. He never set foot in it. - And this is the place? - This is the place. This is the real thing. This is the real Buena Vista Social Club. This is the place where it used to be. The society for black people. People... For workers. Black workers. And it's a famous place, but it used to be a very famous place in the past, too. Not only now, right now, after these sessions, and the album and everything. It used to be, really, an important place. - This was the cloakroom. - Right. People would arrive... They'd arrive here and check their coats and hats. Then, they would start dancing. This whole area was the Buena Vista Social Club. It was a society for black people. They used to perform here, and they used to dance here, as well. And right now, it is a gym. And very modern, by the way. - It was a huge dance hall. - Imagine that this wall didn't exist. This is the original floor. And on this floor, the people used to dance, and they enjoyed life. Like in a film or in a dream... Now? You're going to be famous now? Now your voice is messed up and you can barely walk? When you have to walk with a cane and everything? Now? Well, what do these people know, really, about Cuba? What do they know about the history of our country? What do they know about the things we have been through? Okay, well, many thanks for coming. Welcome to this press conference for the first-ever live performances ofthe Buena Vista Social Club. The album has now sold nearly half a million records worldwide. It's been awarded a Grammy. Wim Wenders is here filming for a documentary. - How did it all take off, initially? - Sorry, I don't understand. He's saying: What was your path? Right. We had discussed doing a big band album, with the style ofthe Fifties. At the same time, we wanted to do an album with musicians from eastern Cuba, together with some African guitarists. And | asked Ry if he'd want to come along, and he said: Yes. But then, the Africans didn't show up, so we did what we did. I wanted to present a project based on the Cuban roots and our ancestors. Nick and l were talking, and he said: I'd like to do this project with you. I lived two doors down from Arsenio and I'd hear him playing his tres every day. He said: come over here. He was blind. He ran his hand over my face, like so. | asked him: What? And he said: You're a handsome guy. So, I told him: No, man. ljust really like music. He nicknamed me Pretty Boy, and ljoined his band the next week. come here, my dark-skinned woman I'm going to die, my dark-skinned woman come here, my dark-skinned woman I'm going to die, my dark-skinned woman Up to the Forties, it was forbidden to play congas in Cuba. It reminded people ofthe power, the sound ofthe original Africans' drums during the times of slavery. The first one to introduce the congas in his band was Arsenio Rodriguez. Arsenio is one of the greatest Cuban musicians in our history. He created the foundation of everything: of salsa, of mambo, of everything that's happening in danceable Latin music worldwide. l'd perform, and he'd say: Do it like this, not that. lt'll sound better. And I became a master of Cuban music. I had a piano, but over time, termites got into the wood. The little creatures started eating away at the wood, and eventually they destroyed the piano. I wanted to have the most important Cuban trumpet player of the last 40 years. I worked at The Tropicana for thirty years. l have devoted myself to be an inspiration for Cuban music. Not to toot my own horn, but I was the best in Cuba. Really, I was. What's up, cowboy? Good to see you. Eliades Ochoa is, like, the flag of country music. This is my neighbourhood. l was born just down the road from here. l was born here, in the steep mountains ofthe province of Santiago de Cuba. - I'm a "guajiro" - l was born just over there ln Santiago, there's something... We are a fusion of Spanish with African and Cubans. In every corner, there is someone playing a guitar or a conga. Here, you drink rum without ice. People party into the wee hours. My mum didn't have a job, nor did my dad, and there were six of us kids. Life was hard. Very hard. When I was a kid, learned a living playing in the brothels and bars. This was the red light district. All these streets here had rooms, side by side, full of prostitutes. They helped me a lot. I am Afro-Cuban Pio Leyva was one of the greatest soneros. Nobody taught me how to sing. I sing because... I don't know. It comes from my heart. The old generation's main bass player was definitely Cachaito Lopez. The violin was my instrument of choice, but my grandfather forced me to learn bass, because it's a family tradition. My family has thirty bass players, approximately. Barbarito Torres. He is the greatest lute player of his generation. My godfather was one of Cuba's greatest lute players: Luciano Monet. So, at the age often, I was given a lute. I started to incorporate different styles into country music: funk, rock... Then they started calling me the Jimi Hendrix ofthe lute. Here, in my head, there's an ocean of music. When I improvise it all mixes together, and what comes out is my creation. Barbarito has gone crazy. When I arrived at the recording studio, Ry Cooder told me to listen to a tape and copy the musician's style exactly. When he played the tape, there was a traditional Cuban song on it... There was a lute solo in the song. When I heard it, I said: That's me. The musician on Ry's tape was me. I'm 90 years old and then some. So, what's my secret? - Your secret is what interests me. - Don't overindulge. - Don't overindulge in anything. - ln anything. Look, look. Listen up. For example, if I'm having chicken, I only eat a small portion, so that I don't get bored with what I'm eating. That way, the next day, I'll still have the desire to go back to that chicken. - The second secret. - The second secret deals with love. - That's what I'm interested in. - When it comes to love, I use the same strategy as when | eat chicken. Compay is like being in front of a Bible, because he knew everything. He'd been alive for a century. I'm one ofthe original son players from Santiago. The music | play is son, and I'm not going to stop now. Son music represents the essence ofthe Cuban people. For us Cubans, music is like our food. When we have had really tough times, we have created styles of music that helped our people to survive. Son is the music ofthe late slaves, during the end ofthe 19th century. People from different parts ofAfrica brought their kind of music, which mixed with European music. Well, in fact, son is the root of all danceable tropical music in the whole of the Americas. l was born here in 1907. People would play son into the morning. We have a saying, 'until the hot chocolate', meaning until sunrise. | created the duo Los Compadres, 'the buddies'. The one who sang lead was Compay Primo, or Buddy Number One, and since I sang second vocals, l was Compay Segundo, or Buddy Number Two. Somebody told me: You should be in Havana. People love your guitar playing. Mama, I want to know where those singers are from So, what I did was travel as far as Bayamo. And in Bayamo, I went straight to the cigar factory. I had learned how to roll cigars when l was fourteen. l'd work until I made enough money to pay my bus fare to Las Tunas. ay mami, where are they from? are they from Havana? are they from Santiago? From the noble land? they are from the mountains, Santiago and sing on the plains, Havana you'll see you'll see Eventually, I got to Havana, in 1934. Havana was a really happening place. There was a lot of music in the cafes and social clubs. There were social clubs for whites and social clubs for blacks. During the Thirties, the racism was really tough. My dad was a musician. He performed with Arsenio. He had to play for one peso until the last drunk left the party. Black musicians were not able to play in societies for white people. There were social clubs for black people, poor black people, for example, the Buena Vista Social Club. The most popular was Buena Vista. The dance hall was small, but the patio was enormous. l was playing in clubs just about every day. In the cabarets, the orchestras were always made up of white people. Over at the National, there were always blacks, but not too dark. They would choose and say: Sir, look for someone lighter, someone less black. This used to be a social club. It was a phenomenon. I played in the orchestra here when l was 17 years old. There is a saying that says: To remember is to relive. Barbarito said: Ibrahim Ferrer, the one who sang with Los Bocucos. l'll speak to you with my kisses so I won't have the sadness of being separated from you so, trust me... l was at home cleaning shoes. I didn't have a job. And then a guy told me: Someone's looking for you. I said: Who's looking for me? It was Juan de Marcos. Ibrahim was one ofthe poorest. He had to clean shoes in order to survive. I was full of resentment. I didn't want to sing any more. I didn't want to live any more, because I was very disappointed... in music. That's what I'm explaining. I retired incredibly disappointed in music. He said: They're paying. That's when I said: Let's do it. I changed my clothes, washed my face and took off. Ibrahim showed up wearing trousers stained with shoe polish. It was a song called Ay Candela, written by Faustino Oramas. Asong I used to sing. I started singing along... But I didn't realise they were watching me. I didn't go there to record numbers. I was there to sing backup. Ruben was restless and started improvising on the piano. two gardenias for you... [love you, [adore you my darling... So my dear Juan de Marcos, my mate Ry, whom you know, and Nick... They discovered me. When I heard Ibrahim's voice, so sweet I got gooseflesh, I started to cry. I knew that voice. Omara is one ofthe greatest singers in the history of our country. Juan de Marcos asked me to record a song for them. At that point, they asked me: What are you going to sing? I told him that I wanted to sing Veinte Aﬁos. I learned to sing it when I was four years old. This is the roof under which I used to live, right here, in this house. I always lived here, from the time I was a little girl. Out back, there was a patio, but it has been remodelled, right? - No, no. It's the same. -No. It didn't have that type of floor. There was a small bathroom there, but they've built a new one. - Yes. - Of course. We were happy. Very happy. There were times we had no food to eat, just water with sugar in it. We were very poor. But our love was so great, we felt like millionaires. You know what I mean? In this little room, my dad taught me the song Veinte Aﬁos. My dad told me to sit next to him. He said: I want to teach you a song. does it matter that I love you if you don't love me any more? we should not dwell on love that is past if only we could make our dreams come true if only you would love me as you did twenty years ago how mournfully we watch our love ebb away it's a part of the soul that is torn mercilessly I learned it here. My mother was white. She came from a wealthy family. My father was black. His mother was a maid in her house. They played together as children, not knowing there were racial issues. They fell in love. So, my mum's family disowned her. My dad told me: You're going to be a great singer. I didn't know what he was talking about. In 1952, my sister Haydee and I decided... to form an all-female quartet. We called it Cuarteto D'Aida. My dream had been to be a ballerina. Every year, I'd audition to join the classical ballet. I was the best, but every year I'd leave crying, because I never got a place. I didn't understand that only white people were allowed to dance ballet, because everyone can sing. Compay Segundo lived in that house over there. When Compay Segundo lived in Havana for a short time, he lived on that corner, on the top floor. I went to his house to audition for him. I sang with his group for a while. She's the best of the best. I sang back up for her. it's a part of the soul that is torn mercilessly Ry Cooder told me: Well, Omara Portuondo is the Cuban Sarah Vaughan. And I said: No, Sarah Vaughan is the American Omara Portuondo. There it is. We're family. He and I. We're family. Well, let's make a toast, gentlemen. Because the truth of the matter is that today is... - A special day. - For us. Here's to... Please. Let's honour... Here's to... - To whom? - To Benny. I would like to have a suit made. A bright red suit. To tell you the truth, I need it so I can seduce the ladies. If you need it to seduce the ladies, we'll do our best. World music is not rock 'n' roll. You don't have a big company behind you and a lot of money, in order to bring journalists and in order to promote the music. You have to perform. The Buena Vista Social Club was not a band. It wasn't a supergroup. It was a group of musicians. Most of them were already retired. And so, we had to create a band, in order to present the music. But Omara was working with her own band. Eliades was working with the Cuarteto Patria. So, I grabbed Ruben Gonzalez and Ibrahim Ferrer, and then we flew to London to present the music for the first time. play the piano, Ruben because I am waiting for you play the piano, Ruben because I am listening to you When I brought Ibrahim to the band, Ibrahim was always in the background. And I told him: You have to go to the front. And I had to move him physically to the front: You are my front guy. play the piano, Ruben because I'm listening to you We performed a couple of concerts in England. Really successful in cultural terms. A lot ofjournalists. And then suddenly, everything changed. We started selling albums and albums. Ibrahim was a great improviser. He was able to catch what was happening where he was performing and then sing about it. look at that woman who is so delicious dance to the danzén I brought it to you from Cuba so that you would feel this excited It's not the same as freestyle hip-hop. What's difficult is that he has to sing. I would like to present to you my friend, Juan de Marcos [know that he will give it to you hard and delicious This is the magic of Ibrahim and Cuban son. they call me the silly one the songbird, the quality fool but the silliest thing of all is me, and I'm telling the truth - All you must do is tune your guitar. - Don't call me old. You're not old, you're just playing out oftune. - I know what I'm doing. - You know... - But do you know you're out oftune? - Yes. - You know you have to tune the guitar? - Those machines lie. They lie, because they are tuned by the machines. - But then... - The machines lie. You can't play out oftune for 2,000 people tomorrow. We are playing it in G. Mother of God! Listen to the music. No, listen to him. He's playing G. This is the right key. - This is G. - This is G. on a tree trunk... It's the same. What more do you want? It's like talking to a crazy person. It's the same note, and he keeps on arguing. - It's just that I'm old. - You're not old, you're crazy. All right, here we go. It's a mystery? No, it's not a mystery, it's wrong, just wrong. Gotta be out of our mind. Right, Wim? You know what I'm talking about. You wouldn't shoot a film with two days of rehearsal. - It's scary. - It's scary. Insane is what it is. That's it, my love. Here's the thing: I'm used to the other way. But now you understand. You get one solo, and that's it. Pay attention, so you know when to stop. Look, I've been singing since I was 7, and I've been doing this for 40 years. Try ninety. Get yourself another old man who can play a guitar like this. Get yourself another old man. My cigar. In the late Eighties, Compay Segundo was retired. I had a quiet period, as all artists do, because you work and work, and then you have to take a break. During that calm period, I was able to write a lot of songs. To write songs, you need to be relaxed, so I went to a beach. Compay came back to Santiago. He introduced himself: I am Compay Segundo. Imagine that. I was a huge fan growing up. He said: I need you to play my music, so that I can make some royalties. He reached into the pocket of his guayabera shirt and pulled out a tape. He told me: There's a song on there. I think we can do something with it. I popped the tape into my tape player. What came out was the famous Chan Chan. I'm going from Alto Cedro to Marcane then from Cueto, I'm going to Ma yari The song is about Juanica and Chan Chan. Juanica and Chan Chan are sifting sand in the ocean, and then Juanica.... and Chan Chan gets 'excited', because she's going like this. when Juanica and Chan Chan were sifting sand in the ocean the way she shook that sifter gave Chan Chan a 'hard' time I even played Chan Chan for the Pope at the Vatican. clear that 'bush y path' because I want to 'sit down' so I can get to that 'tree trunk' and I can't 'get in there' And I think he loved it. silence because the roses and the lilies are sleeping I don't want them to know my pain because if they see me crying they'll die One ofthe most beautiful things, of everything that was happening, was that Ibrahim, whom I've known and loved for a long time, was there. I met him fifty years ago. It's my pleasure to present the little ladies of Cuarteto d'Aida. I was singing with the quartet, and he was a backup singer for Pacho Alonso. Ibrahim and I really bonded over our love of music. That sweetness in his voice... it's the same as his personality. There's a song entitled Good Person. They should dedicate that song to him, because he was such a good person. He'd had a very difficult childhood and had grown up very poor. He was a great singer, but he didn't have the same opportunities. That's life. How many talented people could've succeeded if given a chance? - When you're ready, Ibrahim. - So... You want me to tell you the short version of my life story? According to my mum, my dad was a singer, and I was born at a social club dance. I was raised by my mother. My mum passed away when I was 12. That is why I always carry this staff. To me, this is my mum. My everything. This is how I've always kept her with me since I lost her when I was 12. I was on my own, so I had to leave school and support myself. I used to work here. Myjob was to haul sacks of sugar that weighed over 325 pounds. I was just a skinny kid. Look at these scars. They'll never go away. They tell me that after my mother died, the only way to wake me was to sing. Music is my whole life. The son came down to Santiago de Cuba from the mountains. And precisely, this is where the Cuban Revolution began. So, the roots come from the same place. we have to protect Fidel we have to protect him because he's our salvation Music is so important for us that, during the revolution, Fidel even had a quintet called Quinteto Rebelde. And Quinteto Rebelde used to perform live, from the mountains. They used to make up covers of important Cuban songs, but with different lyrics, referring to the political situation ofthe country. we have to protect him - Winston - it comes in two sizes - Winston - it's the highest quality it's got the best ﬁlter and conserves its ﬂavour Winston cigarettes they've got the best ﬁlter and they keep their ﬂavour Winston cigarettes There was a political crisis, but the musicians had more places to perform, because of the casinos and hotels built by Batista and the American mafia. The Fifties was the golden period of Cuban music. But it was a tough time for the Cuban people, because of the corruption of Batista's government. Winston cigarettes When the Revolution triumphed, everyone was in the streets celebrating. Everybody was in favour of it. They supported Fidel Castro and all the others who gave up their lives so that Cuba could be for the Cubans. We didn't want to be owned by anyone. We didn't want to be slaves. Slavery is very difficult. People asked Fidel ifthe segregation of social clubs would continue, and Fidel responded: I don't know ifthey will continue, but everyone must dance with the Revolution. Fidel tried to eliminate the racism in Cuba with a pen. Fidel cut all ofthe social clubs, and he established a kind of more democratic society, or he tried to do it. It was called 'Operation Peter Pan'. There was a propaganda campaign telling people to send their children to Miami. It was like an epidemic. Many mothers, including my sister, sent their children to North America. Being separated from your child is very difficult. She changed her mind and tried to get her back, but the girl didn't want to return. In the end, my sister moved to Miami, to be closer to her daughter. It was awful. One must accept these things. You can't control people. the era is giving birth to a heart it can't take any more pain or it will die we must keep running the future may fall... That's how I ended up going solo in 1967. My sister was scared to become a soloist. She was very shy, and so was I. I had to see ifl had it in me to become a soloist. This is a show I did in Vietnam, China and Korea. For all those years, Ibrahim was singing backup for Pacho Alonso. He told me he wanted to be a lead singer and I said it would happen. But it hadn't happened yet. He wasn't capable of stepping over people. He waited patiently for his time to come. Come here, Ibrahim. All of you know Ibrahim, right? Give me a close-up of his face, please. Smile, Ibrahim, smile. Ibrahim is a fantastic singer. He is also a great songwriter. Why don't you sing something? Look, she's waving at you. Let's play that song of yours, Vamos a Entrarle a Palos a Ese. somebody really needs to beat that guy up He told me: They say I have an ugly voice. 'Ibrahim who said that?' He had a sweet, delicious voice. THE BEST DANCE ORCHESTRA IN THE WORLD After that, Pacho didn't let me sing. At one point, he told me he was sick of me. But I didn't want to leave, because I founded this band. For a long time, Cuban music was the most important tropical music in the world. Sadly, because ofthe American embargo, relations with the world were lost. There was a kind of evaluation of every artist by the Culture Ministry. And then they say: Well, you are 'A', or you are 'B', or you are 'C'. And then they pay you a salary. This system is good for something. It gives security to the worker's life, not to the rich. That is why there are no rich people living here. I never left the piano. I'm always playing something on it. Cuban music was completely forgotten, and then jazz and rock emerged... and an endless list of songs from outside Cuba. Eventually, I quit. In the end, I felt like a failure. silence because the roses and the lilies are sleeping I don't want them to know my pain because if they see me crying they'll die because if they see me crying they'll die because if they see me crying they'll die Thank you. Pio Leyva is a loser with no prestige you talk trash, but you know you love me Ibrahim wants to sing but no one will give him a chance Ibrahim wants to sing but no one will give him a chance if you sit him in a rocking chair he can't hold himself up I've got faith in my San Lazaro. They call him the beggar. He opens the path and helps the destitute. I put out flowers for him, and a lot of cologne. Every time I leave, I spray him, and I spray myself as well. and says: Ahh, ahh... there is a soft whisper in the silence of a blue night It was a thing of love. We never thought to make money. I've been poor all my life, and I'm so proud of being poor. I'm much more proud ofthe period when I didn't have a cent. This music was made with love. We were all in love with the kind of things that we were doing. These old guys were so happy. We are back on the road. They felt they were useful again. there is a soft whisper in the silence of a blue night In physics, there's something that's very rare. If you've got two particles that are separated and you touch one, the other one is going to move. This is the same thing that happened to me during the first show in Amsterdam. I felt that I was in touch with my country. Thank you. Thank you, family. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. I've been Ibrahim Ferrer all my life. I've been singing for sixty years, and in those sixty years, I've been the same person, with the same voice. Actually not the same voice, because my voice is not as good as it used to be. Now? Now your voice is messed up and you can barely walk? Now? How is it possible that people really enjoy this song? It's unfathomable. They even sing along. It's a song about suffering. Have you got any idea how much my parents suffered? I've never had success like this. Ever. I don't know, am I going insane? Or am I dreaming? I mean, look, I'm 93. It's a bit late, but the flowers of life come to everyone sooner or later. And when the flowers come, they only come once. That's why you have to pay attention when the flowers arrive. In the centre ofthe USA, my aunt brought a Cuban flag to the stadium, and we were performing there for the first time. Cuban artists coming from the island. We are a small country. We have nothing. We have no resources, but we have created the music that we have. It was a dream come true. When Wim Wenders was making the documentary, Ibrahim said: Omara, you've recorded with the whole world. I'd love for you to record a song with me. I said: Well, all right. I don't want the ﬂowers to know the torments of my life Ry and I go back for more than twenty years, and we're very old friends. When he came back from recording Buena Vista... he was so contagious that I realised it must have been very special. And then I heard the music, and then I knew it was very special. He told me all these stories about these old guys, and that they were ninety and eighty, and that they were more full of life than anybody else he ever met. I wanted to see for myself. Let's ask these people, the old folks, the old folks of the barrio: Hey, where was Buena Vista Social Club? Oh, this guy knows. We're looking for the Buena Vista Social Club. Buena Vista Social Club? - Where the society used to hang out? - It no longer exists. Buena Vista Social Club has got to be over there. So, you need to go that way. Well, if you go up this street, to 60th, it's there. IBRAHIM, WE WOULD LIKE TO MEET YOU oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning a rodent put on a dance for some great amusement he chose a mouse as his drummer to play for the whole day an elegant and amiable cat came along as well good evening, my friend... I'm eating a grape. Tell Santiago hello from all of us. - Tell him to give you the ration card. - Get me a ration card, you hear me? the mouse got up on the palm tree roof and announced politely and now if you want to dance ﬁnd yourself another drummer oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning listen, Faustino Oramas and friends, I need someone to put out the ﬂames oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning if you are lost, dial seven zeros that way the ﬁre brigade might turn up oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning oh, Candela, Candela, Candela, I'm burning You know he wanted to kiss me on stage. - Each candle is worth five years. - Cheers. The kangaroos didn't eat this. I still have to pinch myself... to make sure I'm not asleep, dreaming. I never thought I would be so successful. It was astonishing. The day before, Elton John was performing at Hyde Park for 8000 people. We brought 14,000. At the end, Ibrahim was jumping. He became a superstar. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Everybody's going to remember Ibrahim for a century. Fire's out. Ibrahim got a second chance. He was touched by the hand of God, whoever God is. I don't know why they have denied my visa request. At least, I don't feel like a terrorist. All of us here recognise that these are very prestigious awards. They are proof that... And that's wrong, isn't it? ...the world recognises your importance, as well. Ibrahim, I love you. Thank you. - Three Grammys? - Yes. Three. Three. BEST TRADITIONAL TROPICAL ALBUM 2003 - BUENOS HERMANOS - Thank you. - My goodness, thank you for everything. Compay used to play with a travelling country band. They were missing a lute player. Back then, I was a kid who was known as a lute player. He said: We're going to Matanzas to ask Barbarito if he wants to join us. When he had the chance, he came to Matanzas, on the eighth... It was on September 9, 1977. I remember exactly, because the day before, I had buried my father. These people appeared, looking for me to go and play music with them, and I didn't want to go, because I had just buried my father the day before. So, my mother started packing a suitcase with some of my clothes. She said: He's going. His father wanted him to become a musician. And that's how I met Compay. Look at the ocean. This is such a beautiful place, isn't it? My grandmother would send me out to run errands, but sometimes I would go swimming in the ocean. But when I got home, my grandma would grab my leg and lick it to see if I was salty from swimming. My grandmother is buried in this cemetery. She was laid to rest when I was seven years old. I asked: Why are they carrying her in a box? They told me: She's going to a party, and they're carrying her in a box, so she doesn't have to walk, and they're keeping her covered to protect her from the sun. And I said: That's so nice. For my grandmother, Ma Regina. I've fulfilled the three obligations of a man, according to Jose Marti: I've planted a tree, I've had a child and I've written a book. I have fulfilled all those obligations. I feel satisfied with what I've accomplished in my life. I'm an honest man from where the palm tree grows and before I die I want to sing out my soul The flowers of life. How lovely they are. Sooner or later, they come to you in their splendour. Thank you, Maestro. THE FLOWERS OF LIFE Compa y, Compa y Without love flowers will die, and without kisses love will disappear. Excellent. Spoken like a true poet. That's life for you. Music is closer to the true world than the material world. It's so terrible that he has that disease. Can they fix that? His problem is: sometimes his mind just goes. The master ofthe piano, the great Ruben Gonzalez. How do you remember the music so well, and you don't forget? I think that it's the influence of spirits, ofthings spirits enjoy. I have got a lot of spirits of musicians surrounding me. So many of my friends have passed away. When you remember something, it's because your spirit is in it. - Will you ever stop playing? - No way. I will play my last note in the grave.

Now my voice is shot and I can barely walk. You're supposed to be famous when you're 15 or 20. But there's a saying: It's never too late ifthe outcome is good. Before this, I didn't want to live any more. Thank goodness Juan De Marcos came along and roused me from my rocking chair. His final concert was Marciac Jazz Festival. That was... We were going to cancel it, and he said no. By then, his condition was so advanced that they had to give him oxygen every two songs. And four days later, he was gone. the soul surrenders with sweet and total renunciation and when that miracle fulﬂls the wonder of love there are festival bells singing in my heart in my heart He gave everything he had at that concert. He passed away as the most popular, the most famous Cuban singer ofthe 20th Century. I don't know ifl should tell you this. Tonight, and every other night, but especially on this day, August 3rd, our beloved friend, Ibrahim Ferrer, performed here, on this stage. two gardenias with them I want to say [love you [adore you my life give them all your attention they are your heart and mine The son has spread all over the world. That flower has returned, and the tree has bloomed again. That marvellous man, such a great singer, great artist, great friend, a great Cuban: Ibrahim Ferrer. by your side, they'll live on and they'll speak to you like when you are with me and you will even believe that they'll tell you [love you but if one afternoon the gardenias of my love die it's because they have guessed that you betrayed me because another love exists I believe I was born with music in my blood. I like people to know my origins, where I'm from. I like it, because it brings me life. It gives me the desire to keep making music every moment, on any stage, anywhere in the world. That's the strength I receive when I think about where I'm from. along the road by my house a cart driver with his wares passed by with his sentimental songs the happy guajiro sang I'm a guajiro and I have my cart and I lead a good life in the countryside the countryside is paradise the most beautiful place in the world on horseback, we'll ride up the mountain I work without resting so one day I may marry and when that day comes I'll be a very lucky guajiro chop through the mountain farm the plains reap the fruit of your sweat The traditional music of Cuba, son has given me everything I have, up to now. And ifl live a few more years, son will continue to provide. President Barack Obama has invited the Buena Vista Social Club to perform at the White House. This is the ﬁrst time that the popular group will play the White House, just as diplomatic relations are being re-established between the USA and Cuba. We are always thinking of our friends who are no longer here physically. We're going to keep playing as a group and keep playing the same music. We're still playing the same music as a tribute, and we've added some younger members. Everyone associates Buena Vista Social Club with Cuba. This is the first time I ever played the piano. When I was a kid, I learned by listening to him. He was always my teacher and my mentor. We get along really well, grandpa and grandson. And the glucose? He does this thing. Say he's whistling a melody... - I fall asleep. - Then he picks up where he left off. Easy now. - Good to see you again. - Good to see you again. How are you? - Good. - Hey there, Ry. The people ofthe United States chose a man to be president, and it was Obama. He's a gentleman. Very thoughtful, very calm. He is biracial, like I am. He is a mix of black and white. So am I. You are here for an historic moment in U.S.-Cuban relations. What is your opinion on the progress of relations between the two countries? We don't like to talk a lot about politics. It would be like me giving my lute to Obama and the mike to Raul to sing. But if we can make things better by playing at the White House, great. Look at all the barriers. We're the first Cuban musicians to play there in fifty years. Cubans who live in Cuba, that is. Welcome to the White House. Thank you for coming. - Thanks for everything. - Put your instruments there. Can I get everybody lined up against the fence, please? The President came in and shook everyone's hand, and said he was happy we are here, just as if he were a Cuban. - For the picture. Whiskey. - No, no. Cuban rum. - What's next for you guys? - What's next? - We get up early to do our next show. - See what we have to deal with? from Alto Cedro, going to Marcane get to Cueto, going to Mayari - To Mayari and to other places... - To San Antonio. - To Santiago de Cuba and everywhere. - Thank you very much. After a long absence from the USA, the Buena Vista Social Club is coming back on tour, bringing those hot Caribbean beats. This is an important concert for us. In the 20 years we've been playing, we've never played in Miami. I know this place pretty well. I played here with Benny More in 1959. There is a lot of anxiety, but their blood pressure is okay. This is very special. We have not done this before, because we didn't have the opportunity. But now we do. Luna, we're starting. Idania. Let's go. The family you know and love... The audience energised us. This is my family in Miami. We hadn't seen each other in 44 years. We used to play together when we were kids. These are my superstars. This step cannot be skipped, so the music is clean and fragrant. Things are completely different than in 1996, when we recorded the Buena Vista Social Club. The flowers of life came late, but they came. Our national poet, Jose Marti, said: Music is the soul of a people. I am part of a people. Our African roots survive in the Cuban rhythms, in spite of being brought here by the Spanish as slaves. Of course, you can kill a man, but you can't keep him from singing, because that's what makes us human. I want to keep singing until the end. If I'm allowed. I can't hear you. Come on. I can't hear you. Come on. Subtitling: BTI Studios English
