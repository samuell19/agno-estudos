The Korean peninsula lost its independence in 1910, when it became a part of the Japanese Empire. World War II ended in August 1945. Korea was both liberated from Japan and divided into North and South Korea by Russian and American forces. In 1948 the Republic of Korea was established in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north. The national tragedy continued. The Korean War from 1950 to 1953 intensified the antagonism between North and South Korea. The antagonism has not yet ended. The division of the homeland was replicated among ethnic Koreans living in Japan - the "Zainichi". Civil rights activity among the Zainichi was divided along political lines. Although 99% of Zainichi were from South, they were divided into North or South Korean nationality. Those Zainichi who supported the North joined the Chongryun organization those who supported the South joined the Mindan organization. The ideological conflict between North and South Korea intensified among Koreans in Japan. At the same time, they suffered from poverty and discrimination in Japanese society. In the late 1950s, the political and economic situation in South Korea was insecure. Meanwhile, North Korea enjoyed vigorous economic growth, temporarily stimulated by the USSR. Many from the South transferred their allegiance to the North. Then, in 1959, the "Return Project" began. Over the next 20 years, more than 90,000 people emigrated from Japan to North Korea. Under the slogans "The Great National Migration" and the "North Korean Paradise", expectations were raised, both by Japanese media and North Korean supporters. Most "Returnees" and their families believed that diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea would be re-established and that the Korean peninsula would be re-unified. Neither has happened. In fact, the "Returnees" were people who went to an unfamiliar place, where they had never lived. They have not been permitted to leave. One of those who watched their families "return" to North Korea was me. Stop drinking, darling. There's no more beer. You sure? That was the last one. Let's share another can. There's no more. The holidays are one big excuse to drink, huh? Yet another toast. It's new year's money from your daughter. Thank you so much. Why don't you count it? May I? Wow, 50,000 yen in here. Thanks! You're now old enough to be on the receiving end! Keep working hard. Take him to a hot spring some day! Let's eat. We're lucky to have such a good daughter, aren't we? If only you'd bring home a boyfriend one of these days. What kind of guy then? Anyone you love is fine! You sure? This video is evidence, you know. You can't ever complain, Dad. Just no Americans or Japanese. But you said anyone! How about a Frenchman? That's another issue. So you do have parameters! As long as he's Korean. What kind of Korean do you want me to marry? There are all sorts these days. Korean means a Korean just like me. So both nationalities, North and South are acceptable. What about a Korean who has US nationality? No way. No Americans. This isn't "anyone", Dad. Well, sorry. Tea! Tea? But take the Chinese for example. Doesn't matter where they live, they're still Chinese. Anyway, whether my daughter follows my orders or not, whether she accepts my ideas or not, I'm glad because she's all grown up. She's a grown woman. This is Tsuruhashi, the town where I was born. A quarter of the population is Korean. After the recent handshake between the presidents of North and South Korea, conflicts among North and South Koreans in this town have noticeably decreased. Previously, however, there was tension throughout this town... as various massacres and the Korean War cast long shadows. My father, from Jeju Island in South Korea, spent the end of the war in this town. He chose North Korea as his "fatherland". Sixty years have since past. This is my special seat. You r favorite? Yup, here. I'm gonna bike. You are going to bike? It's so close. It's easier on the bike. - Are you going to bike, too? - No, I'll walk. Mrs. Pu! Yes? Coffee! OK! I'm coming! Hurry up! Let's go! Look, you're not going any faster than me! But this saves my legs. Good morning! Hey, I'm done for. You still have plenty of time left. Your dad is already 77 years old. If I live to be 80 or 85 years old with your mom, you don't have to cry when I die. I ask that you say, "Dad and Mom, you did your best throughout your life". That's enough for me! Where should I make your tomb? I don't need a tomb. I want a small tablet, just like this. And you should put it in a temple. Which temple? A Korean temple or a Japanese temple? Not a Japanese temple! A Korean temple! Where, though? Tonguk Temple, in Osaka! And next, you have to bring it to Pyongyang! Go straight to Pyongyang, then! I can't carry a tablet all over the place. I'll discuss it with your older brother. - Shall we reserve a tomb? - Why not! Well, I'm a really lucky man who has such wonderful wife and daughter. I'm happy, happy. Do you prefer to be buried in Pyongyang or Jeju? Jeju, of course. It's my homeland. But no one will visit your grave there. Bury me near my sons, then. That's all. "Sweetbriers bloom and fall in our island village" "A school teacher comes to the village with migrating birds" "An 18-year-old girl falls in love with the teacher, a single man" "My love, don't go back to Seoul Please don't go" She's filming everything! My father chose to live as an activist working for social and civil rights for fellow citizens, "Zainichi", in Japan. He identified himself with communist ideals and became absorbed in the political activity for Korea's reunification led by Kim II Sung. Dad, when did you first hear the name Kim II Sung? When I was 15 or 16. In Jeju Island? That's right. I was surrounded by people who studied Marxism. How come? Were they friends or relatives? Both, friends and relatives. What was their motivation? It was the Soviet Union. After the successful Soviet revolution, many people thought revolutions could succeed in their own countries. He was a founding member of the pro-North Chongryun organization. He told fellow citizens of the greatness of Kim II Sung... and the importance of Korean national education in Japan. The organization opened more than 160 Korean schools across Japan. Pyongyang sent large amounts of money for Korean education in Japan. Many had great expectations that North Korea would support their rights... because their social position in Japan was rootless. As a result, support for North Korea was over 60 percent. You fell in love with mom first, right? Sure, but we fell in love with each other at the same time. You proposed first, right? Yup, at the beginning. Nice, huh? That was good. How did you propose? I said, "I love you!" That's all. And? "Let's get married", I said. You said more, dad. Don't be shy, dad! This is your movie. Stop! I should break your camera! Stop it! That's enough! But you said something else, didn't you? He said it to your grandmother. What did you say to my grandma? He said, "I'll die if I can't marry your daughter". Then mom said, "That's not a good idea. You have to be alive". She's been filming all of this! I didn't realize that. I hate you! Shortly after my parents got married. You didn't have any income then, right? Nope. But you proposed to her. Right. And she still married you! Yes, she did. Lucky you, dad. I was lucky! Even after you married mom, you had no income? No, but we were okay. That's enough! Stop asking! My wife took good care of me. She really did. Your foot. What an annoying daughter. Throw her out. Oh, please. My mother had to work very hard to support her husband. While raising three sons, she was also involved in the Chongryun movement. "The Parade to relay our gratitude to Kim II Sung". And then I was born. Keep it simple, honey. Okay? I know. Happy together until the end of our lives, right? I mean it. What did you say? That we'll live happy until the end of our lives. How wonderful! Don't you think? Will you be quiet? What? What did you say? I may be loud, but you still love me. You love my heart. That's why you married me. Say what you want. Deep down, you love me, isn't that right? Don't talk to me like that. I want to make this collar wider... My parents raised me along with my three brothers. In 1971, I heard that my brothers were going to "return" to North Korea. My family went on a trip to the sea and we stayed at a seaside hotel. This was the first and last family trip for us. We took a family photo to commemorate the "return". I didn't know the meaning of the word "return". But I realized that my brothers were leaving for a place far away. I still remember the scene at Niigata Port Seaport... where many well-wishers waved farewell, and a brass band resounded loudly. I stood on tiptoe in floods of tears to see my brothers off. My mother was standing at the edge of Niigata wharf, gazing at the ferry fading away toward the horizon. She kept gazing long after the ferry had gone. I didn't see my brothers again for 11 years. After my brothers "returned" to North Korea, my mother began to immerse herself in activism. My parents became great activists and devoted everything to their fatherland. People in the community said, "Your family is the model of a revolutionary and patriotic family". My school teachers told me, "You should grow up to be like your parents, someone who swears loyalty to the fatherland". In those days, ideological content related the history of Kim II Sung was incorporated into most subjects taught at Korean schools in Japan. I accepted words such as Fatherland, Loyalty and Revolution without question. I was a model student who routinely wrote such words on exam papers. At the same time, I enjoyed a different kind of culture in Japan. I listened my brother's Beatles records and saw films and plays. These were ordinary parts of daily life for me, born and raised in Japan. I repeatedly heard of the "Revolutionary Capital, Pyongyang". But what I really wanted was to get a sense of the Pyongyang where my brothers were living. I made my first visit to Pyongyang in 1983 as a member of a student delegation from Korean schools in Japan. I saw my three brothers after an interval of 11 years. Although we had been apart for 11 long years, we were only allowed to visit for short, limited times. During these short visiting hours, I kept looking for words to describe the missing years, All I could do was cry. But my brothers kept looking at me and laughing. Much of the two weeks spent there was... taken up with required visits to local attractions, and I had to swear to devote my life to the country. In this country that I'd been taught was my "fatherland", seeing the real Pyongyang beyond photos, I felt more out of place than at home. In the 20 years since my first visit, I've visited Pyongyang several times. I needed time to fully comprehend the reality of life in Pyongyang. What would be best to send them? Are you planning to sell these in Pyongyang? Maybe school supplies would be best? That's right. Pens and erasers. How about these? Only a mother can do this. Exactly! Only a mother can do this. Mothers are always looking after their kids, as they say. Maybe they'll be doctors? They're always asking for pencils. This woman can't help but splurge when it comes to her grandchildren! For Chisung and Chihong for Sona "Take it everyday, from Grandma". Not many children there can get good medicine like this. Not many people pack as meticulously as you do, Mom. When customs inspectors open my bags in Pyongyang, they always smile and say, "This is well packed!" My mother has sent money and supplies to Pyongyang for 30 years. She used to write her sons telling them, "Make an effort to live like locals even if it may be uncomfortable". However, as she has come to know the actuality of life in Pyongyang, the packages she sends have gotten bigger. After her sons married and had children, the packages have gotten even bigger. Would you mind taking some packages to the post office in your car? I'm packing 6 or 7 boxes. If you aren't too busy, I'd appreciate the help. Is that okay with you? Right. I'm still working on it. 4pm is too early, right? 4:30? Yes, 4:30 would be good for me, too. Yes, to the post office... Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Winter in Pyongyang is harsh. One day Mother got a letter that her grandchildren got frostbites. She quickly packed disposable pocket body warmers and sent them. Since then she's sent boxes full of disposable body warmers... not only for her family but also for her relatives. Her sons and grandchildren have survived because of her support. But she always tells people, "My family lives well because our leader takes good care of them". This year, my family decided to get together to celebrate my father's 70th birthday. My father has long wanted to take one more photo of the whole family. "This ferry is leaving Niigata seaport, and is going to Wonsan, the cultural port city in our fatherland". "Currently the waves are between 1.5 and 2 meters high". "The ferry has just left and it will arrive at Wonsan seaport at 4pm tomorrow ". "We wish perpetual longevity for our Marshal Kim Jong ll". "We Hope that our fellow citizens will enjoy the cruise to our great fatherland". That's enough. My brothers once crossed this ocean with one-way tickets 30 years ago. I wondered what they thought about while watching this very ocean. Have Japan and North Korea been separated or connected by this ocean? After my brothers went to North Korea, I grew up in the Korean National education system in Japan, enjoying a free society. I believed that I had the right to choose my career. But I was taught that I had to devote my life to "my fatherland", as the daughter of a patriotic family, even though I lived in Japan. As their only child remaining in Japan, lwanted to please my parents. But I wanted to make my own choices. So I left home and only saw my parents occasionally. Some sea gulls are flying... over the sea. My mother tore up the first photo of my brothers after their "return". She couldn't bare to show it to my father, because they'd lost so much weight. I wondered how they lived, what they ate, what they thought about... My questions were met only by their ambiguous smiles. Kona, who was easy-going, should be okay Since he could make friends anywhere. Konmin, who was 14 then, was flexible enough to be able to adapt anywhere. Kono, couldn't live without coffee and classical music when he was in Japan. He listened to Beethoven on his headphones all day long. I was barely 5 when he spoke to me passionately about music. When Kono "returned" to North Korea, all Western music was prohibited there. But times have changed. And now only Western classical music is permitted. So I sent many CDs of Chopin and Rachmaninoff to Kono. Each time I visited Pyongyang, we enjoyed listening to those CDs. Soon he got married and had a son, Unsin. Kono wrote me that Unsin would fall asleep listening to Chopin. Those CDs have become important tools for Unsin's musical development. Pyongyang Music and Dance College Elementary School You should say, "Grandma, I finally entered the school". Unsin keeps looking at the piano. Where are you going after lunch? To my piano lesson. Hello, my daughter. Aunt Yonghi! You were looking for a piece of paper, right? Here! Great, thanks! Thanks so much. Sona, you're wearing nice pajamas. It's beautiful. Show me your pajamas. Oh! It's "Hello Kitty". Here you go. Sona! Sona! Sona, you should eat them. I want to more! Sona, say it again. Grandpa, grandma! I'll eat a lot! OK, good job! They are so delicious! Say "Thank you". Thank you so much. Thank you! Thank you so much! Good girl! Grandpa, grandma! Thank you for sending so many boxes to us! Why don't you ask them, "Am I pretty?" Grandpa, Grandma! Thank you for sending the boxes to us! Grandpa! Can you see me? This ferry has carried many people with families and relatives in North Korea. Most passengers bring dozens of boxes for their families. The ferry connects divided families. "Our great leader Kim II Sung will be with us forever!" Will my parents ever have an easier journey back and forth? It's a long journey to see their beloved grandchildren. It's a 3-day ordeal by plane, ferry and bus. The North is so close yet so far. I realize. Wanson Seaport. Wonsan seaport is the gateway to north Korea The landscape of "my fatherland" appears unchanged... since I first came here 20 years ago. It seems that time has stopped here. But here too, ordinary people live their daily lives. Lightning assault. Blitzkrieg. Crush all enemies. I see people anxiously waiting to see their families... and sad people still waiting for families who never come. "Today, Pyongyang, led by our beloved general Kim Jong II. Maintained its dignity as the capital of the world's socialist countries. No other country in the world... raises the flag of the socialism so magnificently. Therefore, many advanced people aiming for socialism... visit Pyongyang to witness true socialism at work. This is the highway connecting Wonsan and Pyongyang. The rural scenery seen outside is in stark contrast... to the "City of Revolution" that the guide describes. But even as I feel dissociated from her words, her rustic "North" accent feels oddly comforting. At that moment, I see a sign... "16km to Pyongyang". We're only 16km from Pyongyang. I turn my thoughts toward my brothers, nephews and niece while gazing at the scenery outside. And I'm convinced. I come not to "the great fatherland" nor to the "City of Revolution". I am going to see people I love, where they in turn await me. Pyongyang No. 17, 33, 49! Comrades! Be responsible by marching in perfect order! Even if pushed from behind, do your best to keep your place! Maintain your place in line as you march! Let's do it again. Each group, make an effort! Music! Stop! Be natural. They always stop moving as if it's a still camera. I have to ask them, "Don't stop moving". It's too embarrassing with our arms locked. He's walking self-consciously, like this. My parents look truly happy in front of the statue. But I can't ignore that triangular building behind it. Construction of the building was halted years ago. Unveiled reality is painful to see. Stop! Bouquets down! Comrades on your right side need to be especially sharp, but once the march starts, everyone must follow order. Turn your upper body with grace! Dad! You look so cute!!! Bring my medals here. Belatedly, we've decided to celebrate our father's 70th birthday. My sisters-in-law prepared a traditional outfit for him. You've gotten fatter than before. Dad, you should wear it for your first visit to South Korea. And put on the badge of our great general. You look so young! Ant the color of the vest is nice. You look like an actor who plays a typical grandfather. That famous old actor! You look great. Like a Korean old guy. Really nice. Let's go to the mirror. You need to lose weight. You should go on a honeymoon with those costumes. I'm pulling your dad to the mirror, so film this whole process. Really, this outfit suits you. See it looks great. I'll go back to the hotel wearing this. Good morning! This way? These red peppers will be used for Kimchi. Can you see that steel window guard in the second building? That's the kitchen in my apartment. And the other rooms are on the opposite side. The porch is also on the opposite side. There it is! They're making charcoal. Briquettes. We're almost there. Already noon? We had a nice walk today. Let's go back home. This way. Take bigger steps, like it's exercise. Grandpa, it's a video camera. You're being filmed, Grandpa. Grandpa, long life! Long life! There's so much fat, Grandpa. It won't hurt, Mother. How do you feel? It's painful. Mom, help me again! Your homework? Again? Where? Sona is drinking water and mom is doing Sona's homework. An American has gotten The Nobel Peace Prize! Matthew George I have no idea when you'll finish! Hurry and finish it now. Make it short. How do your classmates do homework without a book like this? Write your name at the end, like "I'll take prize in the future." I really like Aunty. Unsin, you promised you'd play the piano for me. Play the piano for your Grandpa. What can I play for you? Some Liszt first... Aunty, film it! That's great! How do you feel? I feel great! He plays well. I'm happy! My brother has hopes for his son's future. My father is happy listening to his grandson's performance What seems like an ordinary moment for any family... will become a precious memory for us. Ah, some civilization. Electricity is here! Unsin... Play "Prelude". By Rachmaninoff, was it? I can't do that yet. Unsin... You're the best in the world! I'm giving you a compliment! Film it. I'm kissing my grandson. It should be above the heart. Someone told me that. A little bit lower, please. That's not easy. A little bit lower. Above the heart? Right. "As long as my heart beats..." Okay. That's it. Handle them carefully. I know. Is each medal is an acknowledgement of my parents' loyalty? I couldn't smile along with my parents. I couldn't smile along with my parents. My family has always forbidden criticism of the fatherland. That hasn't been easy for me. I've thought that the gap between me and my parents could never be bridged. As talked with my parents over the years. I've tried to understand what their lives were like before I was born. As their daughter, I needed to understand the choice they made. Okay! Both together this time. Thank you. Thank you so much. We're both old now. Many people gathered for my father's 70th birthday... and my parents' golden wedding. They came not only from Pyongyang but also from the countryside, from Sinizyu, Wonsan, Chongjin... For people here, attending a big party for a guest from Japan is an honor. I thanked those who traveled by train for dozens of hours Though my parents were happy that their sons arranged the party. It was paid for out of the allowance sent by my parents. The party for 100 guests cost US $2500. Our beloved marshal has sent his love to the celebration of... Mr. Yang's 70th birthday in Pyongyang, where his family live, in recognition of Mr. And Mrs. Yang's admirable work... as great leaders for our fellows. We will now commence the 70th birthday celebration of comrades Mr. And Mrs. Yang. Do you remember her? Sure, she was in kindergarten then. She's all grown up now. Most of the guests were "returnees" from Japan. They included my brothers' Childhood friends from Japan, And my father's childhood friends from Jeju Island who'd gone to Japan... before "returning" to North Korea. I heard from these guests that my parents had sent boxes and money... not only to their own families but also to many relatives and friends. Each time they thanked my parents, I had mixed feelings. My parents continuously send money and supplies to North Korea. Those who came here are being sustained by my parents. Yet people here speak of those acts as being "for our fatherland..." and "by the grace of the fatherland". I couldn't comprehend what "fatherland" was. And now a few words from M r. Yang. Though I've al ready been properly introduced, please allow me to add a bit more. I started this career in August 1946 by... The grace of the love and consideration of our great leader Kim II Sung. Since then, 55 years have flown by. It's easy to say "55 years". But they certainly were not the easiest of times. I've been reassessing my life in terms of our ideology. Have I been truly loyal to our leader? Have I done my best for the general? Looking back, I found that I had both accomplishments and shortcomings... So I vowed to correct my shortcomings and learn from my mistakes. Yet I realized that I'd already turned 75. At this old age, there are limitations on what I can do. So I gave this some thought. My three sons live in Pyongyang. I also have a daughter, daughters-in-law and many grandchildren now. Including cousins, I have 40 to 50 relatives in this country. My most important contribution, then, would be to inspire these young people... to be passionate about Kim II Sung's and Kim Jong ll's doctrines. Only when I've successfully developed them into revolutionaries... will I have taken a step toward serving our great general. I promise that I'll do my best to reach my goal. I was confused when he said he hadn't been loyal enough. When he said he'd make his children and grandchildren revolutionaries, I almost ran from the hall. I've wanted to talk to him about changing my North Korean nationality. In the past I've asked him about going to South Korea. He was furious. He said it would mean a rejection of his life. Since then, nationality has been a taboo subject in my family Listening to my father's speech now, I wish he could understand I'll never live up to his ideals. I can't be sure whether he'll still accept me as his daughter. I worry that there's no way to bridge this divide between us. Be well! I'll come again! Take care! Take care! We've repeated this same farewell several times. Whenever I go back to Japan, my brothers always tell me, "Yonghi, be happy! Keep your chin up!" And I respond, "You keep yours up, too, brothers!" We say the same thing, but there's a different weight to our words. I say, "You know I'll come again." There's nothing else I can say to them. Three years have past since then. Have you had regrets about sending your sons away? I had no alternative then. But I wish I didn't have to send them. How old were you when you sent your sons to North Korea? How old was I? About 32, 33 years ago... You were 43 or 44? We had exciting prospects for our future... because the pro-North movement had made great progress. I know we were too optimistic. I've talked honestly to my three sons about my feelings. We were probably too naive, and they were too young, also. Konmin was only 14 years old, right? Did you cry when they left? No, I didn't. Did you see mom crying? Yes. I saw that. She was standing at the edge of Niigata wharf. But I never thought whole situation would turn out like this. I believed many issues would be resolved better than they have been. At that time the relationship between North and South Korea was very hostile. Were you planning to go back to Jeju if the South and North were reunified? At that time, yes I was. He had always avoided discussing the past with me. But I appreciated that he was now answering my questions the best way he can. He was terse. But each word carried tremendous weight. This is the only housework you do. That's right. Thank for coming this time. You should come more often. "Thanks for coming?" It's still her home! You're acting strange today. I understand if she can't come. Of course she'll come! She had a good rest here this time. Do you want to say something to your grandchildren in Pyongyang? Stay healthy and study hard! I truly believe that our country will soon make great progress... in the economy and in other areas. Haven't you waited long enough? Faith means nothing without waiting. My loyalty has never wavered... Let them know how I feel. Hopefully they'll normalize relations... so that my sons in Pyongyang can come visit us in Japan. And we'll be free to make phone calls! I going to remain loyal to the great Kim II Sung until the end of his life. What happened? And I'll continue to believe in Kim Jong II forever, too. I have to keep up the work. Therefore, all my sons and all my grandchildren... have to remain loyal to our great leaders. That's my hope. That's the way it should be. It's up to you. Ms. Yonghi. You said "sons and grandchildren". Your daughter isn't included, right? No, you are not. All I expect of you... is that no matter what, you find a partner next year, so you can get married soon. Dad, my nationality is causing problems. Go ahead and change it to South Korea, then. Oh really? Are you sure? You shouldn't have to, but if you must... It's hard for me to travel abroad, Dad. If I do, I need a "Re-Entry Permit" like for refugees. It's easier with a South Korean nationality, right? So go ahead. Will you change yours? You won't change it because of your loyalty, right? Never! Not even after I die. But you'll let me do it. Yup. You said that all your family members have to remain loyal to the leaders. Mom, your sons and grandchildren in Pyongyang... You left me out. You still need to remain loyal. Are you putting me in a different category? Only around this issue. You won't give me a hard time about it? No. Don't be silly! Are you sure? My you've changed. Dad, we're not finished yet. That's enough! Listen to me, dad. When I went to New York, you demanded that I keep my North Korean nationality. I did. Why'd you change your mind? Well... I want you to have a better situation for your work... and many circumstances have changed. I've decided on a small compromise. Don't turn away. We haven't finished talking. Ouch! Stop it. Can I marry a guy living in Seoul? That's okay. That's okay. South Koreans are Korean too, in my opinion. But you'd be lonely if I moved to Seoul as a bride. Sure, but you can come to Japan to see me. I see. Maybe we'll visit you in Seoul. Maybe Kono or Kona can visit. Who knows when that will be possible. It'll be difficult, sure. Dad, I want to ask you more. Enough! What's with her? A glass of water, please. Keeping our North Korean nationality had been the law in my family. He had never compromised on this issue. He said it's for my work, and because circumstances changed. Was he accepting me as a daughter who chooses a different life than his? I was grateful for his smile. Meanwhile, I thought about the harsh reality that... we must choose between North or South Korea. He said he'd never change his nationality. What is he trying to protect? I'll continue to think about the meaning of his words. Finally, I felt like I can talk with him. I wanted to hear more of his thoughts. I wanted him to hear more of my thoughts. That's enough. Listen to me! Which guy would you prefer? A Korean guy who can't speak Korean or eat Kimchi... or a Japanese guy who can speak Korean and loves Kimchi? No Japanese, I've been saying that! Are you mad? I held my father's hand tightly, praying he would keep breathing. His hand was warm, and he held mine tightly. He was in great pain, but I felt in him a strong will to live. I'd never looked at my father's face for this long. New Year's Day 2005 What do you want to say? That you fell in love with me? Your mom and I are still in love with each other. I know. I'll look for someone just as wonderful. We're going to get through this and go back home, okay? Promise me. Let's make a pinky swear. You promise me, right? We should cut those fingers apart. That's scary, Dad. Dad, It's a New Years gift! Isn't it cute? A Hello Kitty envelope this year. Who's Kitty? It's a cute cat. Can you see this? 50,000 yen in here. Mom, don't say that yet. He should know. Dad, you should count it. Let's take a picture holding it. Don't bite it, dad. Do you want to open it? Okay, now you can see the money. Look how much this is. She paid the hospital bill, too. We should thank her. But I still need money. I have a lot to pay. I know. One, two, three, four, five. She gave you 50,000 yen. Put them back in the envelope. I'll work hard to give you more next year. You want to put them in your pocket? Okay, let me help you. You might drop it. NO! Okay. From now, money will go in my suit pocket. Sure, let's do that. What are you going to do with this money? Maybe pay for the treatment? You've already got 20,000 in your suit pocket. I'll put this money with that. Keep them separate. Anyway, you're a great daughter. Okay. Let's hold hands together. We'll do our best! Don't go to sleep, Dad. Dad, mom was crying last night. She's worried about you.
