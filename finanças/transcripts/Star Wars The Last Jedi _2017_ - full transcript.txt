(THEME MUSIC PLAYING) EVACUATION OFFICER: We're not clear yet. There are still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker. Forget the munitions, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transports. - (DISTANT BOOM) - Oh, no. (DISTANT BOOM) We've caught them in the middle of their evacuation. I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself. This is where we snuff out the Resistance once and for all. Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought. Incinerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet. (ALARM BLARING) (RADAR BLEEPING) General, Resistance ship approaching. Guns and shields in attack mode. A single light fighter. (BB-8 CHIRPING NERVOUSLY) Happy beeps here, buddy, come on. We've pulled crazier stunts than this. LEIA: Just for the record, Commander Dameron, I'm with the droid on this one. POE: Thank you for your support, General. Happy beeps. (FLICKS SWITCH) Attention. This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet, I have an urgent communiqu√© for General Hugs. Patch him through. This is General Hux of the First Order. The Republic is no more. Your fleet are Rebel scum and war criminals. Tell your precious princess there will be no terms, there will be no surrender. POE: Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs. This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed. We will wipe your filth from the galaxy. POE: Okay. I'll hold. Hello? POE: Hello? Yup. I'm still here. Can he hear me? - POE: Hugs? - He can. POE: With an "H." Skinny guy. Kinda pasty. I can hear you. Can you hear me? Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him, tell him Leia has an urgent message for him... I believe he's tooling with you, sir. POE: ...about his mother. Open fire! - (DISPLAY BLEEPING RAPIDLY) - BB-8, punch it! (BB-8 CHIRPS EXCITEDLY) (GRUNTS) (BB-8 EXCLAIMING) He's going for the dreadnought. Ha! He's insane. Woo-hoo! That's got a kick. All right, taking out the cannons now. Tallie, start your approach. TALLIE: (ON RADIO) Copy that. Captain Canady, why aren't you blasting that puny ship? That puny ship is too small and at too close range. We need to scramble our fighters five bloody minutes ago. He'll never penetrate our armor. He's not trying to penetrate our armor. He's clearing out our surface cannons. One cannon left. And here comes the parade. (BB-8 CHIRPING NERVOUSLY) Yeah! Yeah, I see him! - (MACHINERY SPARKING) - No, no, no. Damn it! BB-8, my weapons systems are down. We gotta take out that last cannon or our bombers are toast. Work your magic, buddy. (BB-8 CHIRPING) (BB-8 CHIRPING NERVOUSLY) (BB-8 MOANS) Are the auto-cannons primed? Primed and ready, sir. What are we waiting for? Fire on the base! Punch it! The last transport is in the air. The evacuation is complete. You did it, Poe. Now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place. No, General... POE: We can do this. We have the chance to take out a dreadnought. POE: These things are fleet killers. We can't let it get away. Disengage now... LEIA: Commander. That is an or... Wipe that nervous expression off your face, Threepio. Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General. Nervous? Let's go, BB-8. It's now or never! (BB-8 CHIRPING) (BB-8 SHRIEKING) POE: Yes! (BB-8 EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) All clear! Bring the bombs. Captain, Resistance bombers approaching. Of course they are. Bombers, keep that tight formation. Fighters, protect the bombers. It's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought, so let's make this count. Copy that, Blue Leader. BOMBER 1: You get us there, we'll give it to them. - PILOT 1: Copy. We're on it. - Fighters incoming. Gunners, look alive. PILOT 2: Snubfighters at two-ten! PILOT 3: They're coming in! PILOT 2: Form up! They're everywhere! (YELLS) PILOT 4: Here they come. PILOT 5: incoming fighters. Form up. PILOT 6: Vector in at attack speed. PILOT 5: Pull up! PILOT 7: Flank right. PILOT 8: Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down! Recharge the auto-cannons. Target their cruiser. (BB-8 CHIRPING) I see it. Tallie, they've targeted the fleet and begun the priming sequence. Copy that. We're almost there. Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence. BOMBARDIER: I've got a visual on the target. We're approaching the sweet spot. - (BLEEPING RAPIDLY) - BOMBARDIER: Bombs are armed. (SCREAMS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) - Auto-cannons aimed. - Forty seconds to full charge. Destroy that last bomber! Paige, come in. We're over the target. POE: Why aren't your bay doors open? You're the only bomber left. It's all down to you! - Nix! - POE: Paige! Drop the payload now! (ACTIVATOR BLEEPING) (GRUNTS) Look out! No! (YELLS) (GASPS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (INAUDIBLE) (GRUNTS) (INAUDIBLE) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (ACTIVATOR BLEEPS) Bombs away! (EXHALES) (ALARM BLARING) Direct hit! Dreadnought down! (ALL CHEERING) (DISPLAY BLEEPS) (GROANS) FEMALE MONITOR: General, Supreme Leader Snoke is making contact from his ship. Excellent. I'll take it in my chambers. General Hux. (INHALES SHAKILY) Ah, good. Supreme Lea... (GRUNTS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) SNOKE: My disappointment in your performance cannot be overstated. They can't get away, Supreme Leader. We have them tied on the end of a string. Rey! (GRUNTS) (INSTRUMENTS BEEPING) (GRUNTS) (INDISTINCT PA CHATTER) Well done, pal. (BB-8 CHIRPING) "Finn naked leaking bag"? What? Did you fry a chip? (BB-8 CHIRPING) (BB-8 CHIRPING) Finn! Finn, buddy. It's so good to see you. What? Let's... We need to get you dressed. Come on. You must have a thousand questions. Where's Rey? REY: Master Skywalker? (DOOR CREAKS) Master Skywalker? I'm from the Resistance. Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help. Hello? (SCREECHING) (CHITTERING) (KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) Go away. (CHEWIE GROWLS) Chewie, what are you doing here? He said you're coming back with us. How did you find me? Long story. We'll tell you on the Falcon. Falcon? (CHEWIE GROWLS SOFTLY) LUKE: Wait. Where's Han? (SNOKE LAUGHING) Tied on a string indeed, General Hux. Well done. The Resistance will soon be in our grasp. Thank you, Supreme Leader. (SNOKE LAUGHING) You wonder why I keep a rabid cur in such a place of power? A cur's weakness, properly manipulated, can be a sharp tool. How's your wound? KYLO REN: It's nothing. Hmm. The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you, I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader. Now I fear I was mistaken. I've given everything I have to you. To the dark side. Take that ridiculous thing off. (HELMET HISSING) Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo. I killed Han Solo. When the moment came, I didn't hesitate. And look at you, the deed split your spirit to the bone. You were unbalanced, bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber! You failed! (ZAPPING) Skywalker lives. The seed of the Jedi Order lives. And as long as it does, hope lives in the galaxy. I thought you would be the one to snuff it out. Alas, you're no Vader. You're just a child in a mask. (EXHALES) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) Prepare my ship. REY: There's no light left in Kylo Ren. He's only getting stronger. The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks. We need your help. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker. You don't need Luke Skywalker. Did you hear a word I just said? LUKE: You think what? I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? What did you think was going to happen here? You think that I came to the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all? Go away. I'm not leaving without you! (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CREATURE GROANING) (CREATURE WHINNYING) Careful! (THUNDER RUMBLING) LUKE: You're wasting your time. (INDISTINCT MURMURING) (MURMURING CONTINUES) LUKE: Who are you? I know this place. LUKE: Built a thousand generations ago to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion. You've seen this place. You've seen this island. (WHISPERING) Only in dreams. Who are you? The Resistance sent me. They sent you? What's special about you? - LUKE: Where are you from? - Nowhere. - No one's from nowhere. - Jakku. All right, that is pretty much nowhere. Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere? The Resistance sent me. We need your help. The First Order's become unstoppable. Why are you here? Something inside me has always been there. But now it's awake. And I'm afraid. I don't know what it is or what to do with it. And I need help. You need a teacher. I can't teach you. Why not? I've seen your daily routine. You're not busy. I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end. Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why. We all do. (WHIRRING) (EXHALES) - You're demoted. - What? Wait! - We took down a dreadnought. - At what cost? You start an attack, you follow it through. Poe, get your head out of your cockpit. There are things that you cannot solve by jumping in an X-wing and blowing something up! I need you to learn that. There were heroes on that mission. Dead heroes. No leaders. We're really nowhere. How's Rey gonna find us now? A cloaked binary beacon. To light her way home. All right, so until she gets back, what's the plan? We need to find a new base. One with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim. (ALARM SOUNDING) Proximity alert! They found us. That's impossible. POE: That's Snoke's ship. You gotta be kidding me. - Can we jump to lightspeed? - CONNIX: We have enough fuel resources for just one jump. Well, then, do it. We gotta get out of here. Wait. They've tracked us through lightspeed. That's impossible. Yes. And they've done it. (BB-8 MOANS DEJECTEDLY) So if we jump through lightspeed, they'll just find us again and we'll be out of fuel. They've got us. Not yet, they don't. Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up? Permission granted. Admiral, swing us around! ACKBAR: Full astern. Rotate shields! RESISTANCE MONITOR: To your stations! Move, move, move! (ALARM BLARING) Follow my lead. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MALE ANNOUNCER: Green Squadron to launch position. Clear all launch traffic. (BB-8 CHIRPING EXCITEDLY) Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up! FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Technicians, lock down supplies for launch conditions. (MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY) (INSTRUMENT BEEPS) Move! Move! (SHRIEKS) (GRUNTING) (BB-8 SCREECHING) (GROANING) (ALARM RINGING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BB-8 BLEEPS) Poe, are you all right? We need to get out of range of those Star Destroyers. ACKBAR: We need to what? Full engines ahead. Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the fighters will fall back. ACKBAR: All craft, full engines! Concentrate rear shields. (RESISTANCE MEMBERS SCREAMING) Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of range. We can't cover you at this distance. - HUX: Return to the fleet. - (GRUNTS) What is the point of all this if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers? Well, they're faster and lighter, sir. They can't lose us, but they can keep at a range where our cannons are ineffective against their shields. Well, keep up the barrage. Let's at least remind them that we're still here. PEAVEY: Very good, sir. They won't last long burning fuel like this. It's just a matter of time. (INAUDIBLE) Move! Out of the way, everybody! Give room! MEDIC: Life signs are weak, but she's fighting. (BEACON PULSATING) (CHEWIE GROWLS SOFTLY) (PORG COOS) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - (PORGS SCREECH) (PORG CHITTERS INQUISITIVELY) (CHEWIE GROWLS ANGRILY) (CHEWIE MOANS SOFTLY) (R2-D2 BEEPING) Artoo? - (R2-D2 BEEPING) - Artoo! (R2-D2 BEEPING EXCITEDLY) (EXHALES) Yes. - (R2-D2 BEEPING EXCITEDLY) - Yeah, I know. (R2-D2 BEEPING ANGRILY) Hey, sacred island, watch the language. (R2-D2 BEEPS SADLY) Old friend. (R2-D2 BEEPS DEJECTEDLY) I wish I could make you understand. But I'm not coming back. Nothing can make me change my mind. Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person... That was a cheap move. ...but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. (GASPS) Tomorrow at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi and why they need to end. D'ACY: General Organa, Leia, is unconscious but recovering. That's the only good news I have. Admiral Ackbar, all our leadership, they're gone. (ALL MURMURING) D'ACY: Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge. C-3PO: Oh, dear. Oh, dear! If she were here, she'd say save your sorrow for after the fight. To that end, the chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Holdo of the cruiser Ninka. HOLDO: Thank you, Commander. Four hundred of us on three ships. We're the very last of the Resistance. But we're not alone. In every corner of the galaxy, the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol, and they put their hope in it. We are the spark that will light the fire that will restore the Republic. That spark, this Resistance, must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations. And may the Force be with us. (INDISTINCT MURMURING) That's Admiral Holdo? Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo? (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) Not what I expected. (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) POE: Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron. With our current fuel consumption, there's a very limited amount of time that we can stay out of range of those Star Destroyers. Very kind of you to make me aware. Let's get me those fuel projections. And we need to shake 'em before we can find a new base, so, what's our plan? Our plan, captain? Not commander, right? Wasn't it Leia's last official act to demote you for your dreadnought plan where we lost our entire bombing fleet? "Captain." "Commander." You can call me whatever you like. I just wanna know what's going on. Of course you do. I understand. I've dealt with plenty of trigger-happy flyboys like you. You're impulsive. Dangerous. And the last thing we need right now. So stick to your post and follow my orders. FEMALE PA ANNOUNCER: Turbolink banks seven and eight are offline due to maintenance. (ROSE SOBBING) (SNIFFLING) ROSE: What are you doing here? Hey. Hi. Uh, I was... You know, I was just... ROSE: You're Finn! The Finn! - The Finn? - Sorry. I work behind pipes all day. Doing talking with Resistance heroes is not my forte. Doing... Doing talking. I'm Rose. Breathe. - (CHUCKLES) Okay. - Yeah. Look, I'm not a Resistance hero, but it was nice talking to you, Rose. May the Force be with you. Wow. You, too. Okay. But you are a hero. You left the First Order, what you did on the Starkiller Base... When we heard about it, my sister Paige said, "Rose, that's a real hero." "Know right from wrong "and don't run away when it gets hard," she said. - You know... - (STUN GUN ACTIVATES) Just this morning, I've had to stun three people trying to jump ship in this escape pod. - What? - They were running away. That's disgraceful. I know. (STUN GUN DEACTIVATES) Anyway, uh... Gotta get back to what I was doing, so... What were you doing? Uh, just... - Doing some checks. - Checking the escape pods. - No, it's routine checks. - By boarding one with a packed bag. Okay. - Listen, I'm... - (STUN GUN ACTIVATES) - (ZAPS) - (FINN GRUNTS) (BEACON PULSATING) FINN: I can't move. I can't move. - ROSE: I know. - What happened? I'm taking you to the brig and turning you in for desertion. I was not deserting. - I told you that... - My sister just died protecting the fleet. And you were running away. I'm sorry. But this fleet is doomed, and if my friend comes back to it, she's doomed, too. I've gotta get this... I gotta get this beacon far away from here. Then she'll find me and be safe. You're a selfish traitor. Look, we can't outrun the First Order fleet. We can jump to lightspeed! Well, they can track us through lightspeed. They can track us through lightspeed? Yeah. They'd just show up thirty seconds later and we'd have blown a ton of fuel, which, by the way, we're dangerously short on. They can track us through lightspeed. Yes. And they could... I can't feel my teeth. What did you shoot me with? Active tracking. What now? Hyperspace tracking is new tech but the principle must be the same as any active tracker. - They're only tracking us... - Only tracking us... BOTH: ...from the lead ship. But we can't get to the tracker. It's an A-class process, they'll control it from the main bridge. Well, I mean, yes, but every A-class process... BOTH: ...has a dedicated power breaker. But... Wait, but who knows where the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer? I'm the guy that used to mop it. If I can get us there, I can shut their tracker down. Just give it to me one more time, simpler. So, the First Order's only tracking us from one Destroyer, the lead one. So we blow that one up? I like where your head's at, but no. They'd only start tracking us from another Destroyer. ROSE: But if we can... If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer and disable the tracker without them realizing, then we can... They won't realize it's off for one system cycle. - About six minutes. - FINN: Sneak on board. Disable the tracker. Our fleet escapes before they realize. Hmm. How'd you two meet? Just luck. POE: Yeah? Good luck? Not sure yet. Poe, we gotta do this. It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey. C-3PO: If I must be the sole voice of reason, Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan. Yeah, you're right, Threepio. It's a "need-to-know" plan, and she doesn't. - That wasn't exactly my... - All right, you guys shut down that tracker. I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is, how do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's Destroyer? ROSE: We steal clearance codes. No, they're bio-hexacrypt and rescrambled every hour. We can't get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can. Could I do it? Of course I could do it. But I can't do it. I'm a little tied down right now. - (BLASTER FIRING) - C-3PO: Oh! FINN: Maz? What is happening? Union dispute. You do not want to hear about it. (GRUNTS) But, lucky for you, there's exactly one guy I trust who can crack that kind of security! - (BLASTERS FIRING) - (MAZ GRUNTS) He's a master codebreaker, an ace pilot, a poet with a blaster. (GRUNTING) C-3PO: Oh, my. It sounds like this codebreaker fellow can do everything. Oh, yes, he can. You'll find him with a red plom bloom on his lapel rolling at a high stakes table in the casino on Canto Bight. Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz... Is there any way that we can take care of this ourselves? Sorry, kiddo. This is rarefied cracking. You wanna get on that Destroyer, I only know one option. Find the Master Codebreaker. (POE SIGHS) (BEACON PULSATING) - (BLASTER FIRING) - (GRUNTS) (MOUSE DROID BLEEPING) You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me. You're not doing this. The effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings? You're gonna pay for what you did! I can't see yours. Just you. So, no. This is something else. (DOOR OPENING) Luke. What's that about? (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) I was cleaning my blaster. It went off. LUKE: Let's get started. (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) Who were those things? Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they were built. I don't think they like me. LUKE: Can't imagine why. REY: Master Skywalker, we need you to bring the Jedi back because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him. What do you know about the Force? It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float. LUKE: Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things, a tension, a balance, that binds the universe together. Okay. But what is it? Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out. (GASPS) I feel something. - You feel it? - Yes, I feel it. - That's the Force. - Really? LUKE: Wow, it must be really strong with you. I've never felt any... Ow! You meant reach out like... I'll try again. LUKE: Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see? REY: The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence. And between it all? Balance. An energy. A Force. And inside you? Inside me that same Force. And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that? There's something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place. Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness. It's cold. It's calling me. Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! (ROARING) (PANTING) You went straight to the dark. That place was trying to show me something. It offered something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself. REY: But I didn't see you. Nothing from you. You've closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have. I've seen this raw strength only once before, in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now. (RADAR BLEEPS) What was that? Nothing, admiral. Passing debris. The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry. Still can't reach the Resistance? - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn. (CHEWIE GROWLING) (PORG CHEEPING) (CHEWIE GROANING) (PORG CHIRPING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Why is the Force connecting us? You and I. Murderous snake. You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why? I know everything I need to know about you. You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you called me a monster. You are a monster. Yes, I am. ROSE: Okay. We get in, we find this codebreaker, we get out. You know this town? Canto Bight? From stories. It's a terrible place filled with the worst people in the galaxy. Great. (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) (PASSENGERS MURMURING EXCITEDLY) SLOWEN LO: I told those two, I said, "This is a public beach. You can't park that shuttle here." But they just lit off toward the casino. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Place your bets. Place your bets. All bets on the table right now, right now! Place your bets here. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (EXHALES) FINN: Aw, yes! This place is great! Okay. Maz said this Master Codebreaker would have a red plom bloom on his lapel. Let's find him and get out of here. Well played. The house wins. (LARGE ALIEN ROARING) CROUPIER: Where are your manners, more like? ROSE: Come on! (BB-8 CHIRPS) (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) (BB-8 CHIRPING NERVOUSLY) (GRUNTS) (BB-8 MOANS SOFTLY) (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) (BB-8 CHIRPS) (BELCHING) (BB-8 CHIRPING) (ALIEN GROANS) FINN: We've covered this whole casino. Zero red plom blooms. - Where is this guy? - (DISHES CLATTERING) Were those what I think they were? (ANNOUNCER SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) (CROWD CHEERING) FINN: What are those things? ROSE: Fathiers. I've never seen a real one. Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on. Why do you hate it so much? Look closer. ROSE: My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. (ZAPPING) ROSE: The First Order stripped our ore to finance their military then shelled us to test their weapons. (SHOUTING IN ALIEN DIALECT) They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich. War. Selling weapons to the First Order. I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town. (BB-8 CHIRPING EXCITEDLY) Red plom bloom! (GUESTS GASP) Red plom bloom! The Master Codebreaker! Yep, those are the shuttle parkers. (ZAPPING) OFFICER: All right. You two are under arrest for parking violation 27B/6. You have the right to remain... - What was that? - No, no, no. Not now, Lovey. I'm on a roll. (ALL CHEERING) (BB-8 CHIRPS ANXIOUSLY) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (LIGHTSABER BUZZING) LUKE: Lesson two. Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris. That's not true. At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader. And a Jedi who saved him. Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy. But you saw there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn't gone. That he could be turned. And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it, but... Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students, and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late. What happened? LUKE: I went to confront him. And he turned on me. Ben, no! LUKE: He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi Master. A legend. The galaxy may need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn't fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won't. The main cruiser's still keeping beyond range. But their medical frigate is out of fuel and its shields are down. The beginning of their end. Destroy it. The last of our crew has been evacuated and heading your way. It's been an honor, admiral. Godspeed, Rebels! CONNIX: Admiral, fuel reserves at six hours. Maintain our current course. Steady on. Finn, Rose, where are you guys? Deal me in. Thanks. (BB-8 MOANING SOFTLY) ROSE: Finn, the fleet is running on fumes. Without a codebreaker to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer... - (CLANGING) - (FINN GRUNTS) - What do we do? - FINN: I don't know. Unless you got a thief in your pocket, our plan is shot. DJ: Um, I can do it. What? What? What? DJ: S-S-Sorry, I just couldn't help but overhear all the stuff that you were saying really loudly while I was trying to sleep. Codebreaker? Thief? I can do it. We're not talking about picking pockets, okay? Yeah. D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend. Me and the First Order codeage go way back. And, if the price is right, I could break you into old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir. - No. - We're... We got it covered. Ha-tuk-ga. - Did he just... - Yeah. We gotta get out of here! This way! GUARD: Why you little... (BB-8 CHIRPING) (GUARDS MUMBLING) D-D-Did you do this? (BB-8 CHIRPING) Hey, hands up! - Hands up! - Yeah, man. (GROANING) (GRUNTS) (BLOWS) (BB-8 CHIRPING INQUISITIVELY) What's your story, roundie? They went this way! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - Lock down all the exits. - Wait. That smelled great. Those cops will be here any minute. What now? - (FATHIER GROANING) - (FINN SHRIEKING) Whoa! Ooh! (LAUGHS) (FATHIER MOANS) No, wait. Please, don't! ROSE: We're with the Resistance. OFFICER 1: Roger that. Checking the stables now. (FATHIER GRUNTING) OFFICER 2: This way. OFFICER 3: They must have come through here. (DOORS OPENING) (FATHIER BRAYS) ROSE: Hyah! (OFFICERS GROANING) Go, go, go! Whoo! (FATHIERS BLEATING) (ROSE WHOOPING) FINN: Stop enjoying this! Stop enjoying this! (ROSE LAUGHS) SPEEDER PILOT: We've got them. They're not going anywhere. (FATHIER BRAYING) (BOTH GRUNTING) BOTH: Ahhh! (CROWD SCREAMING) (VOCALIZING) Huh? (ALIEN YELLING) (ROSE SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) - (FATHIERS STAMPEDING) - (PANICKED YELLING) (DINERS SCREAMING) (MAN YELPING) ROSE: Move, move, move! Get out of the way! Our ship's on the beach straight ahead! We need cover! (BOTH SCREAMING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Too much cover! There it is! BOTH: No! FINN: Come on! (ROSE SCREAMING) (FINN GRUNTS) SPEEDER PILOT: Let the herd go. Stick with the perps. Where'd they go? I think we lost him! Now we get down to the beach and circle back around... Cliff! (ROSE SCREAMS) (BOTH PANTING) ROSE: We're trapped. (SPEEDERS APPROACHING) It was worth it, though. To tear up that town, make 'em hurt. (FATHIER GRUNTS) ROSE: Go. Now it's worth it. SPEEDER PILOT: There they are. (BB-8 CHIRPING) BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing? (BB-8 CHIRPING EXCITEDLY) DJ: Ah. N-N-Need a lift? (WIND WHISTLING) (MACHINES BEEPING) Luke. Leia. I'd rather not do this now. KYLO REN: Yeah, me, too. Why did you hate your father? Do you have something, a cowl or something you could put on? (SIGHS) Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you, he gave a damn about you. - I didn't hate him. - Then why? Why what? Why what? Say it. Why did you... Why did you kill him? (SOBS) I don't understand. KYLO REN: No? Your parents threw you away like garbage. - They didn't! - They did. But you can't stop needing them. It's your greatest weakness. Looking for them everywhere, in Han Solo, now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night? Yes. No. KYLO REN: He had sensed my power, as he senses yours. And he feared it. (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) Liar. Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be. No! No! FEMALE VOICE: Rey? (FINGERS SNAPPING) REY: I should have felt trapped or panicked. But I didn't. This didn't go on forever, I knew it was leading somewhere. And that, at the end, it would show me what I came to see. FEMALE VOICE: Rey. Let me see them. My parents, please. (BREATHING HEAVILY) REY: I thought I'd find answers here. I was wrong. I'd never felt so alone. You're not alone. Neither are you. Rey? It isn't too late. (BREATHING SHAKILY) Stop! Is it true? Did you try to murder him? Leave this island now! Stop. Stop! (GRUNTING) Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren? (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (REY SHRIEKS) (REY GRUNTING) - Tell me the truth. - (LIGHTSABER DEACTIVATING) I saw darkness. I'd sensed it building in him. I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined. (LIGHTSABERS CLASHING) (DISTANT SCREAMING) Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, and pain, and death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct, - I thought I could stop it. - (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame, and with consequence. And the last thing I saw were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him. Ben, no! You failed him by thinking his choice was made. It wasn't. There's still conflict in him. If he were turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide. This could be how we win. This is not going to go the way you think. It is. Just now when we touched hands, I saw his future. As solid as I'm seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn. Rey, don't do this. Then he's our last hope. Master Yoda. Young Skywalker. I'm ending all of this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I'm gonna burn it down. Hmm. (LAUGHING) Ah, Skywalker. Missed you, have I. (GRUNTS) So it is time for the Jedi Order to end. Time it is. Hmm. For you to look past a pile of old books, hmm? The sacred Jedi texts. Oh. Read them, have you? - Well, I... - Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmm? The need in front of your nose. Hmm? I was weak. Unwise. Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not. I can't be what she needs me to be. Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. (YODA GRUNTING) Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters. Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks. I just hope we're in time. You can actually do this, right? Yeah, about that... Guys, I can do it. But there exists a pre-"do it" conversation about price. Once we're done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want. What you got deposit-wise? Are you kidding me? Look at us. Is that Haysian smelt? That's something. No, we gave you our word. You're gonna get paid. That should be enough. DJ: Guys, I wanna keep helping. But no something, n-n-no doing. Okay, listen here, you've got... Do it. Now I can help. Give it back. DJ: What? FINN: Give it back! You have no idea how much that medallion means to her. What are you... Why are you ransacking your own ship? (SIGHS) It's not your ship. (BB-8 CHIRPING) He says I stole it. - Yeah, I got that. - We stole it. (BB-8 CHIRPS) At least you're stealing from the bad guys and helping the good. Good guys, bad guys, made-up words. Let's see who formerly owned this gorgeous hunk-uh. Ah, this guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh... And the good. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join. That was the last of their support ships. It's just their main cruiser now. And their fuel reserve? By our calculation, critical. She in there? The admiral's banned you from the bridge. - Let's not have a scene. - No, let's. POE: Holdo? D'ACY: You're not allowed in here. - Flyboy. - Cut it, lady. We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship, and you've told us nothing! Tell us that we have a plan! That there's hope! When I served under Leia, she would say, hope is like the sun. If you only believe in it when you can see it... You'll never make it through the night. Yes. (POE SIGHS) Are you fueling up the transports? You are. All of them? We're abandoning ship? Is that... That's what you got? That's what you brought us to? Coward! Those transport ships are unarmed, unshielded. We abandon this cruiser, we're done. We don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward, you are a traitor. Get this man off my bridge. POE: (ON RADIO) Finn, Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttle. She's going to abandon ship. Where are you? Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet. We're so close. Did you find the Master Codebreaker? Well, we found a codebreaker. We can shut the tracker down. Just buy us a little more time. All right. Hurry. As soon as I launch, you jump back out of range. Stay there until you get my signal for where to rendezvous. (R2-D2 BEEPS) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - If you see Finn before I do, tell him... (CHEWIE GROWLS) Yeah, perfect. Tell him that. (CHEWIE GRUNTS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GASPS) DJ: Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes. Then we slice a slit in their shield. Blip bloppity bloop, and slip right through. (BUZZING) (BUZZING STOPS) So a stormtrooper and a who now are doing what? They are trying to save us. This is our best chance for escape. You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can. You have bet the survival of the Resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk. There's no time now. We have to get clear of the cruiser. Load the transports. CREW MEMBER: Right away, admiral. Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that. - (GUNS COCKING) - Vice Admiral Holdo, I am relieving you of your command for the survival of this ship, its crew, and the Resistance. I hope you understand what you're doing. Yeah. - I'm going to the bridge. - (C'AI GRUNTS) If they move, stun them. (BB-8 CHIRPS) OFFICER 1: ...at least three cycles so far. OFFICER 2: Yes, sir. We are working on it. (BB-8 IMITATING MOUSE DROID) (BB-8 WHIRRING CONFUSEDLY) OFFICER 3: I will do my best, sir. (BB-9E CHIRPING INQUISITIVELY) Almost there. You don't have to do this. I feel the conflict in you. It's tearing you apart. Ben, when we touched hands, I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You'll turn. (WHISPERING) I'll help you. I saw it. I saw something, too. Because of what I saw, I know when the moment comes, you'll be the one to turn. You'll stand with me. Rey, I saw who your parents are. Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you is restored. Young Rey. Welcome. (BB-8 CHIRPS) FINN: So this is it. The tracker's right behind this door. (INDISTINCT PA CHATTER) (ZAPS) DJ: Haysian smelt. Best conductor. And you're welcome. Good time to figure out how we get back to the fleet? I know where the nearest escape pods are. Course you do. POE: BB-8, tell me something good. (BB-8 CHIRPS) Poe, we're almost there. Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed. Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry. Clear the bridge, escort the officers down to the hangar. C-3PO: Commander... Captain Dameron, Admiral Holdo was looking for you. Yeah, we spoke. Sir, I am almost afraid to ask. Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GUARDS EXCLAIMING) (GRUNTS) Seal that door! We're running out of time. FINN: Come on, how's it going? Almost there. Threepio, where do you think you're going? It would be quite against my programming - to be party to a mutiny. - Hey! It is not correct protocol. Oh! Neither is this! Finn? We're ready to make the jump! Now or never. - Now. - (MACHINE PROCESSING) (CRACKLING) You're up. (BB-9E BLEEPING) STORMTROOPER 1: You there, hands up! STORMTROOPER 2: Watch 'em, watch 'em. STORMTROOPER 1: Drop your weapons, now! STORMTROOPER 2: Hands up, Rebel scum. STORMTROOPER 3: Get down! I said, down! (BB-8 CHIRPS SOFTLY) (BB-9E WHIRRING) FN-2187. So good to have you back. They didn't make it. Leia. (ALARM BLARING) MALE PA ANNOUNCER: Please board the transports according to your evacuation designation. All transports must be cleared... GURNEY OPERATOR: Okay, help me push him up, guys. HOLDO: That one's a troublemaker. I like him. Me, too. Now, time to board your transport. For the transports to escape, someone needs to stay behind and pilot the cruiser. Too many losses. I can't take any more. Sure you can. You taught me how. BOTH: May the Force be... (BOTH CHUCKLING) You go on. I've said it enough. May the Force be with you always. FEMALE PILOT: (ON RADIO) Cloaking device activated. We should be off their scopes. Let's hope this works. (HANDCUFFS BEEPING) Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises, and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker... (CHUCKLING) I assumed. Wrongly. Closer, I said. REY: You underestimate Skywalker, and Ben Solo, and me. It will be your downfall. (WHISPERS) Oh... Have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice. Is that why you came? (LAUGHS) Young fool. It was I who bridged your minds. I stoked Ren's conflicted soul. I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you. And you were not wise enough to resist the bait. And now, you will give me Skywalker. (REY BREATHING HEAVILY) Then I will kill you with the cruelest stroke. No. Yes. (GRUNTS) Give me everything. REY: No! No! No! (SCREAMS) (GASPS) No. No. No, no, no! LEIA: Poe. What is that? D'ACY: The mineral planet, Crait. An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion. - That's a Rebel base? - Abandoned, but heavily armored with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim. LEIA: Holdo knew the First Order was tracking our big ship. They're not monitoring for little transports. So we could slip down to the surface unnoticed and hide till the First Order passes. That could work. She was more interested in protecting the light than she was seeming like a hero. Godspeed, Rebels. (ROSE GRUNTS) Well done, Phasma. Your ship and payment, as we agreed. You lying snake. (ROSE STRUGGLING) We got caught, I cut a d-d-deal. Wait, cut a deal with what? Sir, we checked on the information from the thief. We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough, 30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser. He told us the truth. Will wonders never cease? No. Our weapons are ready? Ready and aimed, sir. Fire at will. Wait. No, no. No, you can't! No! (PANICKED MURMURING) PILOT: Admiral, we're taking fire! - Do we turn around? - No, you're too far out. Full speed to planetfall. Full speed! (GROANS) (LAUGHING) Well, well, I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi Order the death he desires. After the Rebels are gone, we will go to his planet and obliterate the entire island. (REY YELPING) SNOKE: Such spunk. Look here now. (STRUGGLING) SNOKE: The entire Resistance on those transports... Soon they will all be gone. For you, all is lost. Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope. You have the spirit of a true Jedi! (GRUNTING) And because of that, you must die. (STRUGGLING) My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training, and fulfill your destiny. (BREATHING HEAVILY) I know what I have to do. Ben. (SNOKE LAUGHING) You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy! (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed! I am, sir. You murdering bastard! T-T-Take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It's just business. You're wrong. Maybe. (KYLO REN GRUNTING) (REY GRUNTING) (REY STRAINING) - (LIGHTSABER BUZZING) - (REY SHRIEKING) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) (STRUGGLING) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) REY: Ben! The fleet. Order them to stop firing. There's still time to save the fleet. Ben? It's time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker. The Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels... Let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy. Don't do this, Ben. Please don't go this way. No, no. You're still holding on! Let go! Do you wanna know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? And you've just hidden it away. You know the truth. Say it. Say it. They were nobody. They were filthy junk traders who sold you off for drinking money. (SOBS) They're dead in a paupers' grave in the Jakku desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please. Sir, the Resistance cruiser's preparing to jump to lightspeed. It's empty. They're just trying to pull our attention away. Pathetic. Keep your fire on the transports. (BOTH PANTING) PHASMA: Execution by blaster is too good for them. Let's make this hurt. ROSE: Finn. (WEAPONS BUZZING) On my command. She's running away. No, she isn't. (INSTRUMENTS BEEPING) - No! - Fire on that cruiser! (STRAINING) (GROANING) Execute. (ROSE GRUNTING) Finn! There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go! - Traitor! - (BLASTER POWERING UP) What? (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (BB-8 CHIRPING) Finn! (ROSE YELPS) (FINN SHOUTING) You are a bug in the system. Let's go, chrome dome. (FINN GRUNTING) Come on! No! Hey. (PHASMA GROANS) You were always scum. Rebel scum. (BB-8 CHIRPING) Hey! Need a lift? What happened? The girl murdered Snoke. What happened? She took Snoke's escape craft. We know where she's going. Get all our forces down to that Resistance base. Let's finish this. Finish this? Who do you think you're talking to? You presume to command my army? Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler! (CHOKING) The Supreme Leader is dead. Long live the Supreme Leader. (SPACECRAFT APPROACHING) They're coming, shut the door. (CREATURES WHIMPERING) Incoming! POE: Go! Go! Move! Get that shield door down! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) ROSE: No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us! No! Don't shoot! Hold your fire! FINN: Don't shoot! POE: Hold your fire! LEIA: Finn? POE: Finn! Rose! You're not dead! Where's my droid? (BB-8 CHIRPING EXCITEDLY) Buddy! - I'm so glad to see you! - (BB-8 CHIRPING HAPPILY) POE: Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down. Is this all that's left? All right, shields are up so they can't hit us from orbit. Use whatever power we've got left to broadcast a distress signal to the Outer Rim. Use my personal code. If there are any allies to the Resistance, it's now or never. Rose, what do you got? Rotting munitions, rusted artillery, some half-gutted skim speeders. Well, let's just pray that big-ass door holds long enough for us to get help. (DISTANT RUMBLING) (CREATURES BARKING) FINN: A battering ram cannon. A what now? Miniaturized Death Star tech. It'll crack that door open like an egg. There has to be a back way out of here, right? (BB-8 CHIRPING) POE: BB-8, what do you got? C-3PO: BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics. This is the only way in or out. (DISTANT RUMBLING) (WALLS CREAKING) Come on. We have allies. People believe in Leia. They'll get our message, they'll come. But we have to buy time. We gotta take out that cannon. SOLDIER 1: On me! On me! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) SOLDIER 2: Move! Move! Go back! Gather your weapons! SOLDIER 3: Get over here! SOLDIER 4: Hold your fire! Salt. SOLDIER 5: Ground forces, incoming. POE: (ON RADIO) Copy that. On our way. Engage your mono-ski. The green toggle. (GRUNTS) All right, listen up. I don't like these rust buckets and I don't like our odds, but... What the hell? Just keep it tight and don't get drawn in too close till they roll that cannon out front. All right, ground forces, lay down some fire! Thirteen incoming light craft. Shall we hold until we clear them? No. The Resistance is in that mine. Push through. Fighters, break off! Come on! We gotta hold them till they pull up that cannon! (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) (SOLDIERS GROANING) Rose, you got three right behind you! I can't lose 'em! Whoo! Yeah! (CHEWIE GROWLS) (PORG GROWLS) Whoo! I like this! Blow that piece of junk out of the sky! All fighters! Chewie, peel off from the battle. Draw them away from the speeders. (CHEWIE GROWLS) She drew 'em off! All of 'em! Oh, they hate that ship! (PORG CHIRPING) Chewie! (CHEWIE GROWLS) (PORG CRYING) (CHEWIE GROWLS) (SCREAMS) There it is! That is a big gun. FINN: Okay, it's heavily armored. Our only shot is right down the throat. The cannon's opening. This is our chance. All firepower on those speeders. Concentrate all fire on the speeders! We're taking heavy losses. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (SCREAMS) (YELPS) They're picking us all off. We're not gonna make it. FINN: All right, making my final approach. Target in sight, guns are hot. No! Pull off! What? The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run! All craft, pull away! - No! I'm almost there! - POE: Retreat, Finn! That's an order! Finn? It's too late! Don't do this! No! I won't let them win! No! Finn, listen to Poe! We have to retreat! MALE SCOUT: (ON RADIO) The cannon is warming up now. MALE COMMANDER: (ON RADIO) Copy that. We see it. MALE SCOUT: Preparing to fire. (SPEEDER RATTLING) (BLAST FIRING) Move! Go, go! Quick! SOLDIER 6: Let's go, let's go! (GRUNTING) Rose? Rose? Rose? Why would you do that? Huh? I was almost there. Why would you stop me? I saved you, dummy. That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love. KYLO REN: General Hux, advance. No quarter. No prisoners. Our distress signal's been received at multiple points, but no response. They've heard us, but no one's coming. We fought till the end. But the galaxy has lost all its hope. The spark is out. Luke. I know what you're gonna say. I changed my hair. It's nice that way. Leia, I'm sorry. I know. I know you are. I'm just glad you're here at the end. I came to face him, Leia. And I can't save him. I held out hope for so long, but I know my son is gone. No one's ever really gone. C-3PO: Master Luke. Stop! (MACHINERY CREAKING) I want every gun we have to fire on that man. Do it. More! More! That's enough. (SHOUTING) That's enough! (GUNS DEACTIVATING) Do you think you got him? Now, if we're ready to get moving, we can finish this. Sir? (EXHALES SHAKILY) Bring me down to him. Keep the door covered and don't advance until I say. Supreme Leader, don't get distracted, our goal... (HUX YELPS) Right away, sir. Med pack! I need a med pack! She's hurt pretty bad. It's Kylo Ren. Luke's facing him alone. Well, we should help him. Let's go. No, wait. Wait. Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul? No. He's doing this for a reason. He's stalling so we can escape. Escape? He's one man against an army. We have to help him, we have to fight. No, no. We are the spark that'll light the fire that'll burn the First Order down. Skywalker's doing this so we can survive. There's gotta be a way out of this mine. Hell, how did he get in here? Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists. But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels that the odds of finding an exit - are 15,428... - Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up! - To one. - Listen. C-3PO: My audio sensors no longer detect the... POE: Exactly. Where'd the crystal critters go? (CREATURE WHIMPERING) Follow me. What are you looking at me for? Follow him. (BEACON PULSATING RAPIDLY) If the beacon's right beneath us, they've got to be somewhere. Keep scanning for life forms. (BEACON PULSATING RAPIDLY) This way. (PORG CHITTERING) I see them! Chewie, there! (CREATURES YIPPING) (CREATURE WHINING) No. No, no, no. No! (CREATURES BARKING) Lifting rocks. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (KYLO REN GRUNTING) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) (GRUNTING) I failed you, Ben. - I'm sorry. - I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead. The war is over. And when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi. Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi. I'll destroy her, and you, and all of it. No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father. (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) No. See you around, kid. No! (GRUNTS) (DOOR CLOSING) - (C'AI LAUGHS) - C'ai! - C-3PO: Such a friend. - (R2-D2 BLEEPS) - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - Chewie! (BB-8 CHIRPS INQUISITIVELY) - It looks good. - (BB-8 CHIRPS) CONNIX: That was crazy, man. - POE: Hi. - Hi. I'm Poe. Rey. I know. D'ACY: When we get to the Outer Rim, I have a contact there. C-3PO: Quite definitely possible. Luke is gone. I felt it. But it wasn't sadness or pain. It was peace and purpose. I felt it, too. How do we build a Rebellion from this? We have everything we need.
