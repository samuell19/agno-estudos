Bro, tell Martín that he has bad beer. This only makes you piss. - You kicked the beer, man! - It was almost empty. Bro, this is boiling. Let's buy at Carlito's. A cold one. Just in time. We welcome you. Hail eternal King of all Darkness. Mother of all things earthly and shadows, that bring the dark sky. Provide protection to my soul, as I entrust myself to them, today, tomorrow… and forever. Army of truth, come to me, and take me before the enemy. Enlighten me, and let me become part of your mighty armada. I invoke you. Odium Humani Generi. Odium Humani Generi. DON'T COME BACK ALIVE Hi! Yes, I've just arrived to the hospital. Now? I know this is our office shift, but… is it that ur… Fine. It's ok, don't worry. I'll be right there. Bye. - Good morning Ma'am. - Good morning. Another day in paradise. And your prosecution office always with these cases? My prosecution is in charge of the hottest spot in the suburbs. And you? Love of art? No one wants to get involved with these cases. - People will think I'm a freak. - That sounds logic. - Ma'am. - Oh! Thanks. Give me the news. Same shit. People are insane. Something that I don't know? You better see the show up there. And then, you tell me. At this point, I doubt anything surprises me. Did you talk to Camila's neurologist? No. He's a new one, and doesn't take my calls. - I don't know why he avoids me. - Poor guy. He has no idea! Obviously not. Hi. What do we have here? Once again. "Madness of God". He was killed by his two daughters. Or at least one of them. They were found in trance, covered with victim's blood. They peed on his body, they cut off pieces of flesh, and chewed him. We must establish what each one did. "Madness of God" What's that? Did they think they were God? Who of them was God? Who was the divine one? They often believe that they are God's hand on earth. Or, at least… the bond, with whom makes them believe that they are the nexus to God. Officer, please. Thanks. I've always wondered, what button needs to be pressed, so that someone does such a thing? What is activated in their mind, so that they despise their own blood? These are unstable people. Besides the drugs… alcohol, and extreme poverty. No, Ma'am. I think it has to do with the crisis of faith that exists today. So, you think that these people believe in something? We all believe in something, don't we? Believe or not in hell, hell exists. We live in it. I see it everyday. The guy was about fifty. He had temporary jobs. Look. It's like… pieces of his face had been bitten off. Nice girls, huh? - Where are they? - In the Psychiatric Hospital. According to the neighbors, they heard the big sister shouting: "You must be purified. You must be purified." Or something like that. It looks like written with blood, and washed. That seems to be there from before. Long ago. Sadistic game didn't start last night. They were setting the stage. They were preparing the place for the ritual. I don't think they've painted with blood to decorate. What is that? Are those worms? Yes. Yes, these are worms. Very strange. It's not that much from the decease time. This is the third similar case, in which I've been in the last three weeks. A little coincidental, don't you think? This city has that effect on people, right? Just that lately it seems worse. There's a pattern behind all these massacres. The only pattern I see, is that people are getting crazier. Ma'am... There's a design behind the evil. The architect is laying the foundations, to build his cathedral. You're spending too much time in crime scenes. You should hang out more. Even if you don't believe in him, he… believes in you. Think about it. Excuse me. Hello! Hello! Good evening. Hello! Hello! Hello! Is anybody there? Shall we play "Get scared"? What's that? It's like hide and seek. You count, Excuse me. Get Scared! Hello! Hello! Is anybody there? Hello! Help! Help! Help me! Get Scared! - Heading downtown? - Yes I have no car. Can you take me? Ok. Thank you. - Have a nice day. - You too. When have we gotten used to see things like this? It's like we've lost our capability to be amazed, right? Insensitive. We feel nothing. Speak for yourself. These things still affect me. I don't know what to do with Camila's stuff. I will take them to a storage place. It's been six months already… I need space in my house. What? You have a new girlfriend. She doesn't want to see Camila's panties. Is that? And you? I play in other fields. I see… She will make it. I hope so. All this is very strange. What happened to her mom, after her accident. Doctors said that, it could be an emotional shock, because of Camila. Yes, I understand. But, don't you think that's weird? They both disconnected from the world at the same time. They were not very close, barely talked to each other. But mother and daughter bound, goes beyond whether they talk often, or not. There are things that can't be explained, you know. You must leave me alone with her. I'll take care of her and change her bandage. When can I see Dr. Grimaldi? Well, I don't have his agenda. You should ask at the front office or to his secretary. Ok! - Hello. - Yes, tell me. I need to talk to the doctor. Which one? Dr. Grimaldi. Aren't you his secretary? Dr. Grimaldi doesn't have a secretary. Ok. I need to talk to him. Can I have his phone number? No. I can't give you his number, and I don't know when he'll be back. He's teaching a seminar. It's urgent. Leave me your name and message and I'll let him know. Tell him that prosecutor Carrizo needs to talk to him. It's a must. Ok? He has my phone number, tell him to call me. Today. Bye. Doctor Carrizo, look what I have to do so I can see you. Stop! Police! Fátima! I brought her with me. Fátima! Darling... My baby girl. Darling... Darling, I miss you so much. I miss you so, so much! My baby girl! Mommy! - I love you honey. - Mom. Mommy. Camila! No! Mom! She's with me now. Did you take something to sleep? Hey, hi! No, I was asleep. I can't believe it. Stop. Hold on, you're here. Yes, but what if something happens and I'm not here. Take it easy. "What time did she wake up?" She just woke up. Confused, with a headache, that's all. Can we see her? No, we can't. They are doing tests, and they say we must go step by step. She must rest, and we must avoid an emotional shock. Does she remember? Did she say anything? I don't know. I came in and talked to Dr. Grimaldi, he says this is slow, it can take six, eight months, a year, and she might not be the same. Angel, Grimaldi is a good doctor, he is doing his best, but he doesn't know Camila, he doesn't know how her brain works, her soul. Yes, I know, I'm not a doctor, but I know her! She's a strong woman. Camila will be fine, She will be the same as before, I'm sure! Look. Her mom. How can we tell her? Hi! How are you? How are you feeling? Soon, we will be out of here, you know? We will go to eat sushi, to the cinema, to do all we liked to do. I brought her with me. What? I brought her with me. Hey, hey, hey! This is so quiet! Let's put some music! Are you feeling ok Cami? Does anything hurt? Her ears hurt, because she's listening to you. How are you? Come with me, I want to talk to you. How are you? I'll be back, and we'll go for some beers, ok? Fátima! Fátima! Yes, I hear you, don't yell here. Chill a little bit! You look shaken. I'm trying, but she isn't well. She is delirious, saying things. Wait, hold on. It's normal she acts delirious. Give her time. - What did she say? - No idea what she said. I'll talk to the doctor, and if I have to, I'll take her out of here, now! Hey! The recovery process can take months, up to years. It's impossible to know. For Camila, due to her excellent physical condition, it's possible to be faster. These cases, all depends on the patient, there are chances that, she will never be the same she was. We all agree, this case is a miracle. In a coma for so many months, cognitive usually suffers damages. Are you ready? The longer they take to wake up, the harder it will be, that they get independence in daily life. We can't evaluate yet, the singularity of this case. How are you feeling? How do I look? Beautiful. You are fine. So fine. Where am I going? - To my house. - You're staying with her, but I won't leave you alone. I'll take care of you. Today is a nice day, right? I like this city. Sometimes it gets a little intense, but… I like it. Do you like it? What happened to my mom? Who told you? Angel? Nobody said anything. What happened? We'll talk about it. I promise. We talk later. Come in. Welcome! So glad that you are here! Did you see that? I had a painting there, remember? I've put a mirror, I hated that painting. I'm cooking your favorite food. I've got everything! Cami! Wouldn't you like to take a shower? It will be good, you will relax. You can wear my clothes! Whatever you want. You will feel strange till your body get used to it. I'm fine, don't worry. What are you going to do these days? See my mom. Cami… Your mom had a CVA. And… she fell into a coma. It was short after your accident. It's like, she couldn't handle it. And two days ago, she passed away. I'm so sorry. What happened when they pulled me out? Why don't we better eat? I want to know! There's nothing left. Everything's burned. What about the people in there? All burned as well. It was a ritual of self-sacrifice. A sort of sect, something like that. And the albino woman? What albino woman? The leader was The Albino. A very pale woman. That's all I remember. No, I don't know, but… There was no woman in that group. I'm sure. What's wrong? Camila are you okay? What's wrong? Breath! Breath! Camila. What's going on? Can't sleep? You scared me! Good morning! I'm going to work. I was leaving you a note. But I'll be back early. Great, I'll go to work with you. The doctor said that we must go slowly, this is a long process. If I stay here, I'll get crazy. I go with you. Don't you see that what happened to you is serious? I mean, your body and mind aren't working properly, yet. Fátima I feel ok, I want to go with you. You are so capricious. I've forgotten that. I'll get you a coat. Here. For you. Let's go! Here we are. It seems that lately I am going from hospital to hospital. No, no, you're not going anywhere, I must go in to see two arrested women, but I'll be back in 20 minutes. You wait here. Come on, let me go with you. Camila, I'm the district attorney for this case, I need to focus on what I'm doing. You can stay here, and I don't know, listen to music, take a breath, whatever you need, just wait here, I beg you please, it won't take long. Come on. When they were brought, we had to hold them with five people. We had to sedate them. A lot. They are still under control. Well, I need you to take that out, I'll make them questions, I want them sober. Here is the big sister. Did they say anything when they arrived? They were delirious, talking nonsense. They said that somebody was coming after them. It's all in the reports. Did their family come to see them? Nobody. No visit requested. The younger is over there. Silvina. Better behaved… Excuse me? What are you doing here? I was a little confused outside. I prefer to be here with you. Are you fine? Do you feel ok? Could you get in without permission? Yes, she is Camila, a partner. She is a police officer. Could you stay here, and wait for me? - Go ahead, doctor. - Yes, I was telling you, the big sister attacked her brutally, Police arrived just in time, otherwise… she wouldn't survived. Does she have any psychiatric record? No. No, that I know. We've called, we've asked for the records, there's no answer. She's not ok. You brought her with you. She is closer. Three times to know if you are special. Three times to know if you are special. Three times to know if you are special. Death… is just the beginning. Thanks doctor for... Camila! What's wrong? - Are you ok? - What happened? What happened? Help! Security! Help! Help! Help! Three steps to take you with us. Camila! You are used to violence, because of your professions, but she can't go back to that just like nothing happened. "What the fuck happened? How is Camila?" Take it easy, you can't yell here. I'm sorry doctor. It's fine. Ok. Are you kidding me? I'm not fucking taking it easy! - What happened? - Nothing. She's fine. She came with me to the Psychiatric Hospital, and things got out of control. Just that. No, you're out of control! You! You take her to a Psychiatric Hospital? Just to see two insane murderers? Are you crazy or what? Look, after living with you… I doubt there is a worse madhouse. You don't understand how serious this is. Who the fuck was next to Camila all this time? Only you were there? Only you were there? Lower, please. This time I won't let anything happen to Camila. "You" won't allow. Ok, I see. I'm her only relative. You're not her relative, - That's bullshit! - I'm her couple! You… were! …her couple. - And drive her crazy. - You brainwashed her! - You brainwashed her! - Please. Stop! You can't raise your voice. This is a hospital! Be quiet, please! Besides, this is bad for Camila! If things are like this, it's better to have her here. No, you mean hospitalized? Doctor… No! She can be hospitalized again. She was here for too long. She needs peace. I know! I'll procure she to stay calm. I promise, but… By now, let's let her rest. Please. Yes, off course. Thanks. Talk to your partner, and let me know your decision. Camila will rest a couple of hours. We've given her a depressant to sleep. Thank you. I want to take her for some days to my house. You're burnt-out. I'll go home to prepare everything. I'll be back. Can you stay with her or not? Now what, you're kicking out the other? Either you change your attitude, or I swear you won't see her again, in your fucking life. And who's going to stop me? You? Try me. Try me! Go Ángel. Go, I stay here. Don't worry. Hi, dad? Joaquín! Doctor! Joaquín! Joaquín! Doctor! Get out! Get out! Get out! Wait! Please stop, I did nothing to you. I did nothing to you. I did nothing to you! This is not my problem! Doctor Carrizo, look what I have to do to see you. What am I accused of? Penal Code Article 80, eh? Life imprisonment will be imposed, to those who kill by pleasure, I think, this time you won't get to sentence me. Racial hate, religious hate, hate based on gender, or sexual orientation. Whether the limit is time or space, there's nothing that inspires more horror than an ending. When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you. Stop! Police! Resident demon, Resident demon, show us your power. Come to me, - Listen my sublime calling. - Listen my sublime calling. I invoke you, soul purifier. You scared me to death! Come in! I saw you were asleep, and… come in! This way. Oh, great! Wait here, I'll look for the house sitter. I don't know what's going on. I don't find the house sitter… There's no signal. I'll try to find a way to make electricity work. UNDER REPAIR. DANGER. DO NOT TOUCH. Well, lights on, gas is working. I can see the fireplace. I'll get our bags, then we can prepare some food. Sounds good? I'm coming. I need you to track the cellphone number that I sent on a message. Tell me what zone is it located. Second time I ask. It's urgent! And? How is it? Do you like it? Yes, it's good. It doesn't seem so. I cooked with… two, three things I found. But it's not that bad. The house sitters? It's strange, because… There is no signal, I only got a message from my dad. He told me, these people had… a family misfortune, and they had to leave. I think we will be fine here. A quite place. So that you can… think quietly, and rest. You never told me about this place. No, I haven't been here in a long time. 20, 25 years or so. This place brings back not so good memories. Not for me, or… or my family, but well. Why? What happened? It doesn't matter… And well, I thought this could be good. Be with you here, now. But, tomorrow we go to a hotel. If you don't feel comfortable. No, we are fine here, alone. Let's go to bed? Let's go to bed! Fátima. Fear is the supreme emotion. And through it, we purify ourselves. Good morning. How did you sleep? I got a little confused again when I woke up. I don't sleep well. I didn't either. We must get used to the house sounds. No, there's something wrong with me. Something happened that night. Off course something happened. You fell in the bunker of a bunch of maniacs. That. No Fátima, you don't understand. Something happened that night, they did something to me. Cami, I know you've lost six months of your life. But I promise that you will make that time up. Breakfast? I have an idea, maybe you like it. When we finish here, we can… visit the town. Buy some stuff, we need many things here. And have dinner there, in a restaurant. It's not a big place, but, it could be nice. We can socialize a bit. Besides, we don't have signal, no idea why. The network is broken, no idea what's going on. What do you think? You go. I stay here. The last thing I want now is to see people. Are you staying here alone? Come with me. Yes, I'm much better so. Besides, you don't have to do all this for me. What? Breakfast? Oh, it's your turn tomorrow. Easy. You know what I mean. Leaving everything to take care of me. It's the least I can do. We are coming for you, to take you with us. We leave you a little more in this hell. The town has changed so much. I wasn't there in a long time. So many memories. What about you? You are weird. You know you can trust me, right? Wherever I go, it's going to find me. Are you talking about Angel? Where is Angel? Why isn't he here? And why should he? He has more important stuff to do. Is anybody there? Who's there? Camila! Look here, smile, and say: whiskey! Whiskey! Very good! Applause! Shall we play Get Scared? Get Scared? - What's that? - You never played? No. What's that? It's like hide and seek. You count, I hide. If time passes and you can't find me, I can scare you. It scares me. See? It's so cool! We play all the time in school. I don't like it. We better play another game. Come on Nuria! Don't be boring. But, your mom said that we are going to blow the candles. We better go back now. Fátima. Fátima, where are you? Fátima! Where is the house? I don't know the way to go back. Fátima! I don't like this anymore. Fátima! Get Scared! Fátima! There you are! Fátima! Fátima! Get Scared! Fátima! Get Scared! Nuria, no! Mom! Help! Help! Mom! Help! Help! Help! No! Cami. Camila. Calm down. Calm down, come. Calm. Calm! Calm! Come here. Calm down! It's ok, it's ok. It's ok, it's ok. It's over. It's over. It's ok, it's ok. It's ok, it's ok. Calm down. Calm down honey, it's over. They are coming. Angel, I sent you the location. Please I need you to come. Please. It's urgent. Camila. Camila. Camila! Fátima! Poor Nuria, right? What are you doing here? How did you get out? Get away. You and I know, that the least you want, is that I get away from you. They're already here, take a look. They came for us. Who are they? It's normal to be afraid at first. But don't worry, I'm here to help you. I'm here to make everything easier. Get away! I'm armed. Police is coming. You have to let yourself go. Time has come. I'll shoot! Nuria didn't want to play either. Nuria didn't want to play either. Why are you doing this to me? Get Scared. Get Scared. Get Scared! Get Scared. Get Scared. Get Scared! You never told her that it was your fault. No, it wasn't my fault. It was an accident! Fátima! Fátima get out. Get out, or I won't talk to you anymore! Fátima, I don't like this game. This is not fun! I know you did it! Fátima! Fátima! What?! Are you shooting me?! - Shoot me! - No, no, no. I'm sorry. So good you to be here. - We must leave. - You are sick. What was that shooting? I can't explain now, we must leave. - It's urgent! - Where is Camila?! - Ángel please! - If anything happens to her, - here in the middle of nowhere. - Ángel, I beg you, - Ángel! - Please, let's go! Camila! Camila! - Stop Ángel! - Let me go! - I'm here! - Camila! Here babe. Ángel. Ángel. - No, no, no. No! - Camila! Ángel! Camila. Camila. Ángel, get away from her. She's not Camila. What are you saying? I don't know what happened but she's not her. She is not Camila! Trust me! You promised me you won't leave me alone. And you were not going to hurt me anymore. Calm down sweetie. I'm not leaving you. I won't leave you alone. I swear. I came for you. Are you coming with me? Get away from her, Ángel. Listen to me, she's dangerous. You were always between us. Trying to seed discord. Trying to separate us. Pretending to be a friend. I swear is not that! We must leave. It's true, that's not her! Believe me, please, believe me! We must leave! I was wrong. But this time I'm going to make it right. And I won't let you get into her head. Would you sacrifice for me? Fátima! You can get out now, I won. I don't like this game. Fátima! Fátima! It's not funny! Poor Nuria. Her body was never found, right? She didn't want to play Get Scared. Relax, trust me. We will do this trip together. Fátima! What did they do to you Camila? They made me understand that it exists a higher plane of existence. Where we can make amends for our mistakes, and purify our souls. Look at me. Look at me, I'm Fátima. We can get out of here. We can go together and we'll be fine. Relax. All blood arrives to its own quiet place. It's time to close the circle. Time has come. It's time for purification. We can be together from now on. Love each other, take care of each other. Understood? Nothing and no one will break us apart. Hail eternal King of all Darkness. Mother of all things earthly, and shadows, that bring the dark sky. Provide protection to my soul. Today, tomorrow… and forever. Army of truth, come to me, and take me before the enemy. Odium Humani Generi. Odium Humani Generi. Odium Humani Generi. Hail eternal King of all Darkness. Forgive me. Mother of all things earthly, and shadows that bring the dark sky. Provide protection to my soul. Odium Humani Generi. No! Resident demon. Show us your power. Come to me. I invoke you. Soul purifier. Odium Humani Generi. It seems that revenge came for the prosecutor Carrizo. An old debt was collected. Why are talking about revenge? They came for the officer Camila Rivas. They finished what started months ago, in the suburbs. A bunch of mad people! It's always better to choose that they are insane. It gives more comfort. Anyway, Mrs Carrizo was very lucky. Do you think that's luck? Yes, off course. She's alive. Three. A number that is repeated. They say it's a mockery of the devil. In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. Three. The father with the two sisters, from last case. Three. Camila Rivas, Ángel the prosecutor. Three. Always… there are three. I don't get how you believe those things. No matter if you don't believe in the devil. The devil, believes in you. She didn't believe. It's the crisis of faith. Evil exists, whether you believe in it or not. For evil... your bravery, is like a children's game. It's a game that sooner or later will end, and fear always wins and we become believers. You believe or not in God, but we all will end up believing in the Devil. She is now a believer.
