Thanks. A fifty and the rest in tens. Thank you. - Thanks. In fifties please. A ham sandwich and a beer. We're out of ham. Leberwurst or hot dog. A hot dog? A hot dog. Leberwurst. What are you drinking? - But I asked for a hot dog. A beer. That's 50 Centimes chair rental. - But I'm not sitting in it. Yeah, but as soon as I turn my back, you will though. That's not quite right. - Go on, tell me I short-changed you. Sorry, you have though. - You're not the first one to try that one! You're waiting for someone who doesn't exist? - Yes maybe I am. How about a drink? - Yes, why not. What will it be? - Double whiskey. - Two. Tell me, what's your... - Marie-Paule. And yours? - Nicolas. To absent friends. Well, I've got to go on my way. - You mean now? I've got a rendezvous. - You think, maybe, I'll see you tomorrow? Yes, maybe you will. - Here? Yes, if you like. - I'll be here. They all say that. Then what? Nothing. She walked out. So you grabbed a young woman by the shoulder and said... what? Repeat it. "You're waiting for someone who doesn't exist." And why did you say that to her? Just because. - Just because. You've never picked up a woman in your life. I know. I know. But suddenly, I said to myself, "why not?". You know what I mean? Why not? A million reasons came to mind of course. But I don't know what happened to me. No reason struck me as a valid one. And? - If you have no reason not to, anything is possible. Is she pretty? Yeah. How pretty? She's pretty, you know. Pretty. And then what? - I went back to the bank. Ah, too bad. Look at the condition they sent my manuscript back in. What do you mean "too bad"? Because it is too bad. - What do you want me to do? Tear her clothes off in the street? Me? I don't want anything. You were telling me just now, how all things were possible. And besides, why the street? Listen to what they say: "Claude Fabre should stick to subjects he's better acquainted with, and recognise that his pretentiousness is a bore." Bastards. What are you going to do now? I'll have to send it to another editor. And you? Tomorrow, I'll sleep with her. - That'll be the day. Wow, I figured "Well, he's forgotten about you. He's too busy to." So, I didn't bother to wait. To wait? - Well, I began without you. It doesn't matter. Oh yes it does. I'm embarrassed. Never mind. You're not missing anything. It's like cardboard. Do you have to keep standing there like that? - No. You know I really have been showed up. Interesting? - I just saw it and purchased it. Hey, next time, leave the cardboard out. Do you want to go now? Please bring the check. Where will we go. - It's up to you. You lead the way. You have fresh towels in the bathroom and the toilet's down the hall. Thank you. If you want something, don't bother to ring. The bell doesn't work. How about that? You don't waste your time, do you? Will you think of me afterwards? I swear I will. - You'll be nice to me? I will. You make your living at least, don't you? Yes, why? - Well, I'd rather forget about the whole thing, than take money from a guy who hasn't got any. What's wrong? What's got into you? What do you think I came here for. For you? You heard her say, the bell doesn't work. Get undressed! You have 20 seconds to do it in. Repeat after me: "I came here, only because I wanted to." What? - Repeat it! I came here, only because I wanted to. As soon as I saw you, I knew I wanted you. - As soon... Hey look, you wouldn't be a bit funny in the head by any chance? - I'm waiting. As soon as I saw you, I knew that I wanted you. That's got to be the ugliest tie in the world. Kiss. Afterwards, if you want, we can go and look at the trains. She's a whore. - And so? Did you pay her? No. - You walked out? Not quite. I raped her. - Oh. It's almost impossible for a man to rape a woman of average strength, unless he's knocked her out beforehand. Did you knock her out? - No. - What you did is, you seduced her. If you say so, then I seduced her. - This all took place in your lunch hour? No, I can't pretend that I'm that fast. - So, you didn't go back to the bank? No. Andreas, we have reason to celebrate. - Yes, sir? We'd like you to bring us refreshments. - Sir? - What are you drinking? Cognac. - That's one cognac and another cherry shake with a drop of vodka. Very good, sir. - What's the occasion? There's just the faintest ray of hope. - Hope of what? Right now, I'm not too sure. You have a presentable shirt? - Yeah. Well then wear it, and meet me here at eight tomorrow. But tomorrow is Wednesday. Having supper with Groult? - Yes, as always. "Sing", he kept saying. "Sing." - Really?! In the middle of it? The trouble is I can't carry a tune. Come on, I want you to meet my friend Sylvie. - How do you do? - A pleasure. And over there, that's Toby. - Hello. - Come on son of a bitch. Get it! Don't pay any attention to him. - This is for you. - That's nice of you. I'm sure you won't be bored. - With the professor of philosophy? With the wife of the professor of philosophy. - He has a wife? - Right. And the wisest thing would be that you sleep with her, soon as possible. Is this for your next book? - Let's say I'm doing research. - On what? On you. - You want me to have dinner with someone I've never met, so I can seduce his wife. Is that it? - That's it. - But why? - But why not? Because... It's just not done. That's where you're mistaken. That's a flashy tie you've got. Marie-Paule gave it to me. - We'll have to educate Marie-Paule. No involving with the crowd? You've surely noticed Brecht never used that technique. He knew full well the effectiveness of his plays would suffer and no matter what anyone says, Mr. Brecht prizes effectiveness. I'm astonished a philosopher like yourself - Reactionary philosopher to be exact, my friend. With a healthy respect for Aristotle and a soft spot for Saint Thomas. Something's burning. - I'd better go see. - Yes, but Plato on the other hand says... Ah. Plato preached a lot of nonsense my dear fellow. No but seriously, you really ought to have more respect for the classic traditions. Such as? - Such as... - George, can you help me, will you? - Excuse me. Sorry, but I hope our conversation is not boring you. No, absolutely not. I think it's fascinating. - Fascinating, yes indeed. You don't like her. - Sure I do, but... - Then what are you waiting for? I'm warning you, it's overdone. - You want your meat so raw, it's still breathing. That's all. Watch your cigarette. - What? You might have known. Nothing to get excited about. Ah, just a second now. There. It's high time we got to meet you. Claude has been talking about you for years. Claude? - An old boarding school custom. Boys were known by their last names only. Nicolas still observes it. For him I'll always be just Fabre. And your line is banking, right? - Yes. Yes, it is. I've been trying to reason lately with my husband. He's had several propositions in publishing but won't give up his chair at the university. - Never! It's too much fun. A culture in its death-throes is a fascinating phenomenon. And nobody is as well placed to observe its agony, as we are in the university. Claude, your friend reminds me of someone else. Who could it be though? He does resemble Tacitus in miniature. Mommy! - Jerome, what are you doing here? There's a man sitting on the chair. - A man sitting on what chair? Where? My room. He keeps staring. - You should be asleep at this hour! Back to bed now. But a man is there in my room. - Did you turn on the light? - Yes. And when you turned it on, the man had disappeared and there was clothing where he'd been. - Yes. - I know what. Do you mind if we go to his room? - Of course not. Come on. Now listen to me, Jerome. I know that man very well. He comes out in the dark. When the light is on, he goes away. The minute we fold our clothing on the seat of the chair, instead of on the back, he goes away for good. He goes away to bother some other little boy, who didn't put his clothes away right. Do you understand? - Yes. Good night angel. - Good night Mommy. Thank you. The strange man disappeared thanks to Mister Mallet. Is that you? - Yes. Did you have a nice dinner? - Very nice. Did they like your tie? - Very much. Still want to go out? - No. Want to screw? - No. I'm too sleepy. - Okay. Sylvie thinks that you look just like Steve McQueen. Yes? What is it? - I saw your ad in "Fox and Hounds" magazine. Are you the inflatable real life rubber doll in plain brown wrapper no questions asked that I sent for? - In person. Please, would you come in'? I'm not proud of myself. Me neither. It's never quite as awkward after the first time. - Never. And you mustn't expect any miracles. - Oh no, you mustn't. You could come closer to me. What did you come for last evening? - I wanted to sleep with you. But you didn't know me. You didn't know me either. It doesn't make sense. No sense at all. No, wait. - What for? Just a second. Time's up? - No. I know you think that's a bit of a habit. And you're right too. It's because of the daylight. You should make love at night. Late at night, when the world's asleep. You're letting me talk, huh? So what? The breast? Great. The skin? Great. The legs? Really great. - You keep saying the same thing. How did you take her? - She took me. Did she talk while you were doing it? She said: Nice of you to say that the beef wasn't too well-done for you last night. She said that? - Yeah. Darling. And she said nothing else? - No, nothing. - I love you. What did she say afterwards? Now it's my turn to look at you. She didn't say anything special. Did she say anything about me? - No, nothing. She said, she hoped to see a lot of me. Good work. What do you mean, "good work"? I'm now confident that whatever you wish will be possible for you if you do as I say. 'Cause I successfully seduced Roberta Groult? - No, becauses you successfully raped one Nicolas Mallet. It sounds like the end of a chapter. The end of chapter one. You quit your job tomorrow. - You're crazy! That was a bleat, the bleat of a lamb that's found out it's gone astray. Too bad about sheep. They trot along from childhood to the chopping block, without a thought in their heads except to conform. All they ever seem to strive for is postponing until the last possible second their inevitable date with the butcher. Good morning, Mister Kalfon. - Morning Mallet. Don't bother me unless it's urgent. It is, Mr Kalfon. I want to quit my job. When exactly? - Today. - Today? - Yes. Aren't you supposed to give your employer a month's notice? - Yes, Mr. Kalfon. You don't give a damn? - No, Mr. Kalfon. I suppose you found something better? - Yes, Mr. Kalfon. And may I ask what, Mr Mallet, out of curiosity? - Mr. Kalfon? - Just what do you want to do now? - To become rich and to screw a large number of women. Exactly what I said to myself, Mr. Kalfon. Leave the theme for next week. We'll translate 2 more chapters for Wednesday. Yes sir. - Bye Sir. - Bye. - Sir. - Good bye. Well? - I did it. In that case, you may sit down. What now? - We'll just have to see. Start to do our homework. Start making plans. Have you seen Marie-Paule? Yes. - Where is she usually operating? Down town. The local bars are open all night and now and then, suburban joints. No hope there. - Where do you want her to go? It's hard if she's alone. But if she's you... If you did it buying luncheon every day with her at Maxims. After a couple of weeks, you look at your watch and leave before the dessert. - Maxims? But I never set foot in there! - It's high time to went to more than one place you've never set foot in. It may not be a bad idea to do something each day that you've never dared to do. That you wouldn't have thought of before. No matter how small or senseless. It's important. You must go into training. You have to get rid of your inhibitions. Excuse me, Miss. - Misses. Excuse me. I'd like to ask of favour of you. - You really are persistent, aren't you? Yes I am. Because I would like to ask you, if I might kiss your finger tips. Here? - Here. - Which hand? - Ah, the left one. Make it fast then. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Misses. Excuse me Sir. You're not by any chance a handicapped person, are you? No, I'm not. Why? - I've to ask you to give up your seat. Thanks. Sorry to trouble you. You see I was blinded in Algeria. Incurable syphilis. Who needs a reason anyhow! - Hello. Do you hear that? Pierre's leaving us. To retire. - You're selling out? - Sure, if I can. I have my eye on a little place out in the country. - The man's right. Have you had any offers? - Oh, not many, so far. A couple of agents, but they're never to be trusted. You wouldn't know of a buyer. - Who me! Do you know anybody? I might. I'll have to think it over. - Well, if I sell through you, you'll get a commission for your trouble. - It's a deal. Let me see what I can come up with. Now, why were you so late? - I was spending my time in bed with an old blind lady with blue-rinsed hair and a case of senility. Aren't you ashamed? - To each his own. - Come on join me? No, I have to go. I've a date. - I thought we were going to go to Max's for lunch. Not Max's. Maxim. And you'll have to go alone today. I have a couple of errands to do. Is anything wrong? I'll give you all I've got. - What?! Look I've worn this shirt for 6 months now. You You don't want me to wear it another 6? Would you like some other girl to serve you? - Is she good looking? What are you really after? - A new shirt. - That's FF62.50. You pay the same thing for it as everybody. - I will offer you one entire night in exchange for my shirt. To do with me whatever you like. - No fooling! Come on. Show me how well you can rape me. - Here? Right now? You mean I have to have a rendezvous? - No It won't count as rape if you undress. - I'm sorry. Hello? - It's me. You remember Berthoud? Berthoud? - The kid they threw out of school. - Oh! The one who ran off with the headmaster's daughter. - That's right. He's a representative these days. - Is he? Well good for him! - No. Good for you. Why? - 'Cos he's going to be useful to you. Now you call and make a date with him. - But... - Berthoud, Molitor 26-66. Got that? - Molitor 26-66? I got it. I'm sorry. There was someone at the door. I'll give him a call. It's not really my speciality. There must be a dozen safe ways of investing your savings. It all depends on the sum available in my opinion. A hundred. - A hundred... thousand? Around that, yeah. - Hey, you're doing pretty well. - Not bad. Now, I've got to be on the floor for a vote of no confidence. But if you're free later... How's the headmaster's daughter? - You remember? - What've you done with her? You never go to the movies, do you? Didn't you see "China Doll" or "The Sierra is Home to Me"? - Shirley Douglas? - Alias Marie-Thérèse the daughter of the headmaster. - God - The little girl's come a long way. Marie- Thérèse. Listen to me. How'd you like to acquire a little land around Bordeaux? Thank you. Go back there as soon as possible. I'm sure they're waiting for you. If you weren't so prejudiced against the silver screen, you'd know what happened to our headmaster's daughter. - Apart from pornos, nothing made in the west is worth going to see. Is she an usher? - She is Shirley Douglas. What? - Our very own headmaster's daughter, in Hollywood? One you shouldn't miss, is "The Sierra is Home to Me". She was quite a beauty. - She still is. Concentrating on your homework? - You bet. You saw the Rolls Royce. Did Roberta tell you that her husband's away? - No. He left yesterday - You might have told me sooner. - Hold it. Where's all the money coming from to invest in Roberta's scheme? - It's not my biggest concern. I can hardly get the money to pay my rent with. - Nothing's more difficult than having to get the rent money. Yet nothing could be easier, if you're at all smart, than locating a million. - You're kidding. Not a bit. Listen. Did you ever do it on a chair with Roberta? Do it once for me, okay? Why didn't you let me know? - I thought about it. Only I kind of hate sending telegrams as soon as my husband turns his back. How did you know he was gone? From my guardian angel. He must be guarding the two of us. - That's right. He's had his cough syrup. Doesn't do much good though. He often asks about you, you know. It'd be nicer in bed, don't you think? Do you want to wear his pyjamas as well? One day we'll spend the whole night together. Did you ever make love on a chair? - I should hope so. It's elementary. Or in the shower, standing on my head. You've tried it'? Or in the kitchen, under the table, on all fours? Forgive me. Shall I make some coffee? - Now, that is a great idea. Why work in a bank? - Well the bankers were the ones who managed to force the family out of the business. So I figured I'd rather be on the winning side. What about your friend Claude? Were you with him at the time of the accident? Yes, I was in the car with him. He was driving a new car. In fact he hadn't been driving too long. Have you read his books? Yes. - And? Well I can't judge. I know him too well. He lent George his latest book. I read that. - And? I hated it. Is this a dream of yours? - It's more than that. It's my goal. And you really think it exists? - Certainly. - Where? I don't know where. I do know it's where certain questions are never asked. But where you have the time to ask others. And when are you going there? Just as soon as I've found someone to go with me. Jerome's going to wake up soon... Thank you for the coffee. I really don't want to go. On my dream-island, nobody leaves. Forget it. You can pay me the next time. - Thanks. Hello there. I waited for you, you know. It's more than a week since anybody's heard from you. What have you been doing today? - I went to see a movie. The bartender's been asking. He wants to know if you got a buyer for his place yet. Asked me if you really are a regular guy. So right away, I said you'd never say you had a buyer just like that, unless you had a buyer. - You said that? Yes. - Thanks a lot. But I never said I had one. All is said was... Anyhow, don't worry if you can't come up with one. I've got someone else. You see, that's what I came to tell you. We met while I was having lunch at Maxims. He's not bad, quite funny and terribly rich and all. He's been looking around for a good investment. - You're absolutely right to've come here. What's his name again? - Lourceuil, But I call him Julien. I told him that you were my brother. I hope you don't mind? When do I meet him? - If you like, we'll ring him now about making a date. Not before I've expressed the gratitude that you so richly deserve. How can you be so silly! Come on. Strange the two of you don't resemble each other at all. - That's what everyone says. - I can explain it, Mr. Lourcueil. We don't happen to have the same parents. You understand that after 3 years with Gisèle, it wouldn't be right to just drop her. So I thought of giving her a business of her own, one that runs itself. You know the sort of thing I mean. - My bar sounds just like what you're after. Now, when do you want to see it? - Shall we say tonight? Young man, your sister is absolutely charming. Refined, honest. I wouldn't think it fair... - Mister Lourceuil. My sister, whose qualities you mentioned just now, and she has others I assure you, is a big girl. Cigar? - With pleasure. This project with the little bar is all very well, but you wouldn't by any chance be interested to consider a more substantial investment? - Interesting? - Extremely. I know an area where it would be very shrewd to purchase certain tracts of land. I have it on the best authority, that in five years, the government is bound to acquire that same land and the owners will be able to name their own price. It's a highway. - How did you know? You must join us for dinner some night. Mme. Lourceuil would love to meet you. I knew Marie-Paule would provide the solution. If we'd wait long enough. - I don't see how you know... - It was plain as day. Well, the point is you're on your way. Now, Lourceuil. Did you say how much you want? - I told him, I'd think about it. I don't suppose you're aware that it's not money you need most now. You need a position. - You're late again. - Sorry Sir. I had a flat. - Have you finished your conjugations? - Most of them. - Well sit down over there and finish them. - Did your mother give you the money? - Yes Sir. - Go on. Get to work. You return it when you clinched the deal. From now on, we start organising. When someone is introduced to you, note the name, what he does, who he is. Nothing, nobody is going to escape you. It'll all be useful, sooner or later. Yes Professor. Alright you. Come on. We haven't got all night. How do you do? You haven't met my young friend, Nicolas Mallet. Mr and Mrs Carelmann. Then I got in touch with Grandin. He contacted Bayard and they had it all sorted out in a week's time. Yes? - Mr. Andrémos would like to know if it's at all possible for you to see him some time next week. Let me see what I can do for him. Right. Say Thursday at 02.30. Yes. What is it now? - Miss Allard is here, Sir. Oh. Have her come in. Miss Allard, Sir. Watch out! - I know! But Julien's at Lyons for the day. Ooh and ah, I say! He knows how to compensate a man for his talent. Don't you cheat on me with that other bird. What's her name? - Bernadette. She's named after the saint. - They're the worst. Well. What are we waiting for? Bernadette, I shall be in conference the whole afternoon. - Very good, Sir. Smile at the birdie. I'm not very handsome, not very intelligent. Not very seductive. But I have a nice car. How about it? - You know, all that matters is that it gets me there. Take me far away. I can't explain it. Don't ask me things, I can't explain. Look at that one. Good afternoon, Sir. Forgive me. I wonder what the lion must think of me. Well lions don't much like women who cry. There's something I should tell you. You see my husband wants another child. He did what was needed last night. Let's go feed the storks. It should not pose any serious problems. At any rate, I appreciate your doing it. I'll leave you now. You'll certainly find lots of old acquaintances here. Now I'm beginning to see more clearly. Only what I see is not much. Bleaker, my friend, is the desert. Even though there's some very nice scenery. You haven't mentioned Roberta lately. Any reason? Seems her husband wants another kid. - Groult? - And Marie-Paule? - Lourceuil is crazy about her. They're always together. Perfect! Someone's missing. - Who? - Just someone. I don't know who. A connection, pull, what it takes to move you ahead. We seem to be stuck in traffic. Oh, I see the problem. All those women around and only one is important - Marie-Paule. We need another woman. She's bound to be in here somewhere. There! - What? Interesting. Don't you notice anything. No. There's Bethioud, the minister of culture, Ducroux... Now compare the photos. Ah. - Who is she? - Never met her. She was at at least 6 parties lately and always talking to most important people. Oh yeah. Now I remember. A tough nut to crack. Exactly. She's the one you need. I give you exactly two weeks. Hello. How are you? I'm delighted to see you're in. I had business in the neighbourhood and thought I might drop in to say hello. That's nice of you, but unfortunately you see, I was just leaving. Oh well, sorry. I didn't realise. I wouldn't want to intrude. No. Come inside. I'm sure I can spare a minute or two after all. May I offer you something to drink? - Oh no. Thank you. Tell me, how's your son? - Jérome? He's just fine. Just fine. Hello. How are you? - Just fine thank you. How have you been? You know, Mr Mallet had business in the neighbourhood when he had the happy idea to drop in on us. - How very nice. Sorry, but really I've got to be on my way. No, no, no! Stay where you are. You'll be very welcome company for my wife. Why of course, do stay. - See you tonight, my love. - Goodbye. Bye now. You must join us for dinner again one of these days. - Oh yes. With pleasure. Thank you. Goodbye. What's wrong? - I had to be with you. That's all... But we had a date for 4 o'clock? - I couldn't wait. Mad at me? - A bit. Why? I was wondering if you have the courage to explain what you want from me. As far as I'm concerned it's very simple. I'll leave George whenever you like. It's embarrassing? To have ordered a snack and the waiter serves a whole meal. No. I don't mind that at all. Don't get so upset. I didn't make an ultimatum. It's all your fault, you know. What made you think you had the right to barge in and disturb our routine? You should never spring surprises on women, Nicolas. It's dangerous. They simply adore it. Yes? - Mr. Carelmann on four, Sir. - Thank you. Mr. Carelmann? Nicolas Mallet. I took care of that matter for you. No, no. No problems. No difficulties. A simple question of money. Oh, don't mention it, You're more than welcome. Well yes. If you insist. At your last cocktail party, I was introduced to a woman I found absolutely fascinating. I had a conversation with the lady. it was most interesting. I've forgotten her name. She's tall, brunette, extremely elegant. Yes. What did you say her name was? Flora Danieli. Oh thank you. Do you know someone in a position to arrange for me to meet her again? I think you ought to know who I am. Philippe Benoit, a practising pederast. I've been known to play it straight but not by many people. There she is. Flora! Fancy meeting you here! - Very fancy. How are you? - You know how it is. - No. But I can do without your explanations... Surely you know Nicolas Mallet? - I've seen him. Snapping pictures in the mistaken impression that no-one sees him. - Oh, there must be a mistake. Sorry to cut in. Excuse me, there are certainly a million things you have to do. No. Well I thought... - Remember to thank the person who put you up to this little ambush. Now, goodbye. - Goodbye Flora - See you soon. - That's right. Anything you want to say? - Let's say I didn't expect to find you so... ...disagreeable? Nobody troubled to tell you what a disagreeable person I am when being imposed on. - Before I'm guilty of imposing further, I'll leave you. Exactly. Get down! Down boy. Poor fellow. Roberta! I gave a little thought to your problem and arrived at the following solution. If your husband really wants to have a child, the way to stop his trying to... Well? - You tell him that it's already on the way. Yes, yes. We'll take care of it. - You mean it? - Yeah. Would you mind my giving you a great big kiss, right here and now? - Here? Right here, yes. - I wouldn't mind a bit! What do you think you're doing there? - He's going to be the father of my child. That's what I read. This is the best position to be sure you're having one. The best position to ensure my having cramps, you mean. I love you. I mustn't forget, there's someone I ought to see that I owe an apology to. Well, my friend, we thought we ought to explain. Help me. Well, you see... And then? - Well, nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? Nothing. She told me to get the hell out. You've had two weeks to work it out and that's all you can produce? - All the rest makes up for it. - What rest is that? Two weeks and no new call card, or name. Nothing! It looks to me like you're resting on your laurels.1 or 2 things to know. You're not halfway yet. Sure you've got a job, car and money. Thanks to Lourceuil! What've you done for him? Nothing. One more month of this, you're nothing again. Oh come, you're exaggerating. - Are you blind or what! Take a good look at these cards. What can you use from all this? This one from last week? - No. - This one? No! Berthoud? - I haven't seen him since. What have you been doing in the last two weeks anyhow? Roberta is just ancient history. She's off the list. The same goes for Sylvie. It just keeps on going from bad to worse. If you don't make some progress, we're screwed. - Miss Rollin telephoned to say she'll be half an hour late. - Alright. Thank you. It still may work out. But on one condition. That you complete this card. - Sure, but Flora. To begin with, you break off with her. Ah. Marie-Paule. - We've a date tonight. - And Lourceuil? - He thinks she's seeing her parents. Does she have any? - Parents? No. - So much the better. A souvenir. Hey stranger, where you've been, eh? - Don't you recognise me? Well, let's go to my place, so as not to waste time. OK? - But I want to eat first. Ah, but I can't hold out that long! I want you so much, I've got goose flesh all over, just the thought of you. Aren't you hungry yet? - Your go. When Lourceuil pronounces my name, it's sounds so funny. - How does he? Marie-Pooole. - That's how it should be pronounced. How are you doing with it? Oh fine. He's a nice chap, you know. There's just one thing tho'. - What? In the last few weeks, he's been obsessed with politics. The elections! Elections aren't for another six months. - Oh well. You know me and politics. Oh no. This is impossible. - Why? - We're missing the double one. Oh! Are we now? Find it then! Look, I'm hungry. - We'll get you some food, just as soon as you find it. Ah, your little brother. - Hello. How are you? - Fine, thank you. You've lost weight. - Nonsense. - You know my dear boy, I've always seen you alone. - Alone? - No women. Oh well, you know, me and women... You mean! - No, that's not what I meant at all. - Nicolas is in love. - Oh really? With a woman who is not free. Look out for the woman's husband, eh? Ah Brochard. I haven't seen you for years. Cazaneuve, so did you land that contract? - Yes, but it cost us the earth. I'll take you home now? - I'll go alone. - What? You know how to make me eternally grateful. Don't tear your hair out by the roots and say life's a meaningless bore without me. - Flora, what's the matter? I've simply become tired of you. - Flora I love you. - You make me sick. Did you come here in a car? - Yes. Would you have the kindness to take me home then? - Certainly. Oh, it's you! - Yes, it's me. - Oh never mind. Well, shall we go? Martini, cognac, gin, port? - I'd prefer to have a beer. German or English? - Oh, it doesn't matter. - Oh. Won't you come over here? Still have nothing more to say to me? - No. - I don't mind that. All I ask of you is not to go about it too fast. Thank you, Eleonore. Eleonore? - Yes. Her father thought big. Your reward. Though whether you deserve it is another matter. Despite my request, you were somewhat rapid. No, thank you. You'll avenge yourself some other day. But not now. You need to have a drink. Well clone. I'm invited out to dinner this Saturday, but I'll try to be back by midnight. Is that all right? Wonderful. Thanks for driving me home tonight. Not now. Good night, Mister Mallet. Did you hurt yourself, Mister Mallet? - No, no. It's alright. Ah. I'm so glad. Yes? - Mister Fabre on line three. Hello. - Making progress with Flora? - Yes and no. - What do you mean? Either you slept with her or you didn't. I slept with her. - So, you're in business. I'm not sure. It wasn't easy. - What are you talking about? If you slept with her that's it. - Of course it is. Goodbye Sir. - Two female ostriches are running in the desert with two male ostriches in hot pursuit. Do you follow me? - Yes 'course. Now the female ostriches know that the males can run faster 'cos they've much longer legs. They discuss the situation as they run and decide to hide before the males overtake them. So they hide, heads buried in the sand. The males screech to a halt. One says to the other: "Where did they disappear to?". - And? You see, it's not a bit funny. The chap I just had lunch with laughed so hard he almost strangled on his fois gras. - Who was it then? - Oh, someone in politics. That friend of yours, the representative. Do you still keep in touch? - Berthoud? Yeah. - With the elections coming up... - Want me to talk to him about it? If you promise not to tell anybody. - Word of honour. I should like to run for election myself in Alsace. - At last. What do you mean "at last"? - You're a born politician. - Do you think so? It's obvious. You're very tolerant, right? - Ye-es. - Generous. - Yeah, well. And you're full of ideas. The huge success of the company proves it. - Yes true! - The truth is you're neither tolerant nor particularly generous. As for ideas! Despite this, you're able to convince people to the contrary. - But... - You know the key-words, the words that are most politic. Even reacted the right way. I'm only disappointed that you have so little confidence in me. Precisely, what is it you want? To be useful to you. - Yes, I know that! But why? I'm very rich. I know instantly when anybody is out to get my money. That's not what you want at all. The day you discover my services are of no more use to you, is the day you throw me out. - The very day. - Since I'm aware of it, I've to be of use to the end. The two male ostriches come to a halt, saying: "Where did they disappear to?". Very funny. By the way, let me find out who's running in that district and then we'll know where we're at. I found the missing link. For Lourceuil. He hopes to run in the next election and needs Berthoud's help. You certainly seem to be happy about it. - I found the connection, so I won't have to put up with old stone-face. Old stone-face? - Flora. Lourceuil-Berthoud, Berthoud-Lourceuil. You're at the mercy of two men. Well, you need twenty like them. And where are you going to find them? When will you see her? - I have a date for tomorrow, at midnight. Well, there you are. You're late. - Yes. I'm sorry. I wasted hours, trying to make up my mind about what to wear. Did you solve the problem? - In a way. Let's see the result. It suits you. - Rather simple. It seems almost basic. - Not too austere? - No, no. I have something to tell you. - What? I thought about you from 10.30 to 10.46. - That's too long. Well, I have something to tell you, too. - What? - We have the whole night. He's out of town 'til tomorrow and Jerome is next door, for the night. We have all night? - Why? What's wrong? I have an appointment at midnight. - Saturday, an appointment at midnight? Yes. If you won't be gone long, I could stay right here. No. But I'd be glad to drive you home. - No. I don't want you to be late. Just one other thing. - What? - I'm pregnant. I'm late. I hope that Miss Danieli is furious. Miss Danieli has not come home yet, Sir. Would you like something to drink? Cola with a shot of milk and a wee drop of ketchup. - Very good, Sir. I'm afraid we're out of ketchup, Sir. I had to make it with mustard. - It's even better that way. Thank you. - Exactly what I thought, Sir. What can one say, except "thank you"? You did that rather well. I mean that. - Sorry? - Oh, by the way... I'd like to ask you a favour. Don't go rolling about on the carpet, or go about screaming life without me is boring and dull and so on. Can you do that for me? You don't want to see me anymore. - Exactly. But, Flora, I need you. - Get someone else, my friend. Your minor talent in the sack, I can do without. - But it's nothing to do with sex! What then? - I need the respect you enjoy, wherever you go. The terror you love to sow on bankers and politicians. I need the way you smile and sneer right on cue. I need your visiting cards. Why do you want all that? - To become so rich so I can sleep with lots of women. Yes. But what do I stand to gain now? - Nothing. Why didn't you say so in the first place? Sit down, will you? Your friend Lourceuil is crazy. The man he wants to run against is unbeatable. Not a chance. So rightwing, they think the Swiss lean to the left. What will he do then? - Run elsewhere. A seat where he'll be unopposed. I'm sure you can arrange it, except... - Except? - You need to be more relaxed, my boy. Keep breathing. - What do you think I'm doing? - Deep breaths. I'd be glad to help, if I knew what was in it for me? - Is it money you want? If I earn a million more this year, it would just go to the tax man. How about the means of getting your message across? Support for your views without any visible connection. Would that interest you? - Such as? A newspaper. - A newspaper? - A good way to further your political ambitions. Hold on. I'm willing to give Berthoud 51% of the shares, but he mustn't count on being the paper's editor, you know. - Well, it certainly can't be you, either. Or no-one would take your editorial seriously. - Well, who? Why not you? For example. I think I have what he wants. The seat from Bordeaux. There's a big conservative majority but they're split up seven ways. It should be simple to win except they're up to here in debt. Tell Lourceuil to read up on Lenin. - Lenin? He doesn't expect me to run with a red flag, does he? Does he want to be a representative or doesn't he? You're making progress! You should relax more, old boy. Take a deep breath. I'm far too busy to read that. You read it. Give me a resume. 600 pages. Won't that influence the basic style of your articles? - My articles? For the paper. - Editorials! I'll count on you for that. I want a good job, too. You were right. - That was fast. - You bet it was! All we need is a paper that's for sale. Did they reject your book again? Yes. And where will you find it? - I don't know. Shouldn't be all that complicated. There's always one going broke that's for sale somewhere. Which one? - I'll have to ask someone. - Who? - Flora? - Flora. It's alright but not "The Chronicle". It's "The Times" that you really need. They print 100,000 copies per pressrun. Not big league journalism but it's steady. - They maintain that large pressrun only because it looks good. Their actual sales have hovered around zero, the last few years. What's the guy's name, the owner? - You mean the gal's name. A funny old gal, whose husband left a fortune he made from a string of whore houses in Brazil. He died about 2 or 3 years ago. Left her The Times, along with the rest. Her name? - Hermens. I'll arrange for you to see her. - That's nice of you. In return, do me a favour. Walk out on me as if I made you angry. - Sure. Why? The tall fellow over there. I want to try him out. Isn't he a bit too young? I've learned not to be influenced by preconceived ideas. Yes. What is it? Nicolas Mallet, a friend of Flora Danieli. - When you hear a long buzzing, push. What? - Push! It's open. - Not especially. - Push. But I'm trying to Mam! And his death happened in the same way. So simple and so sudden. I couldn't have stayed. I couldn't go on there without him. So I came back here. To dream of lost happiness. Flora mentioned... - That girl is a most charming girl. I love her like a daughter. But I don't sell my newspaper. I've arranged for you to see each of your editors during the day. - And the editor in chief? - Mr Masseran is on leave of absence, I'm afraid. - He is? Since when? - Since last June. - June? Why is that? - He's an old, old man Sir. See he gets adequate severance pay and knows there's no reason to return. Have you seen her since? - Once. She insisted that I play cards with her. Cards? - Casino. And she even cheated. Careful. You're missing an opportunity. You just handed her a very healthy sum. What's she going to do with it? - I don't know. What she wants to! What you want her to. You ought to go back to casino. Try to break the bank. You've made progress since last time. - You say that to make me feel good. By the way, your investments... - I'm interested but only for the short term. With very good return, though. In our country house, gentlemen, it's forbidden to talk business. - Yes, my wife has enforced that rule for over 20 years. As a result, we spend weekends wondering what to talk about. - I know him well. No need to force yourselves. Mallet, go play billiards with my niece. She's bound to beat you and that always sweetens her disposition. Is your gardener nuts or something? - It's Saturday. I order him to water the lawn on Saturdays. - A thousand francs a point, okay? - Can you afford that? Don't be such an ass. - Does your niece live with you? - Such is our luck. Her mother died in childbirth. Her father was locked in the toilet in the Trans-Europe Express that was derailed at Metz. My turn. - Big shot. Let's see what you can do. You want me to come back tomorrow? I saw that in a film with Paul Newman. Spectacular Push from the Left. Have you seen it? I saw it. - Okay? - It could be worse. Why, what's wrong? - How much are you worth? Ten / twelve thousand. - What were you worth 3 months back? Not very much. I suppose a couple of thousand or so. Polls show spectacular gains by Nicolas Mallet. - Look if that doesn't please you... I'm not complaining. Everything is just fine. But 12,000 is petty cash. It's time you earned some real money. How far are you with Madame Hermens? - Oh well, I invest her money for her. From which I take a small commission. She's quite satisfied. Every so often, I play casino with her. - In your opinion, what's she worth? Oh, 20 million or more. - About right. Are you doing your homework? Homework? - Isn't it about time you slept with her? Oh. No. She's older than God! - So? It's at that age and all alone in the world they appreciate certain small attentions. Small attentions! - Which could move one to great generosity, when drawing up one's will. - Look, I'm not a gigolo. Such a harsh word for such a minor action. There's got to be another way. - You mean another widow blessed with that kind of fortune? If you know one, it's ok with me. I think I can find you one. There. - Lourceuil's niece. - And she's got money of her own. As if she'd give it to you! She's only 18. - So? - So, you'd have to marry her. Alright, then I'll marry her. - I've no objections. It's time you thought of getting married. When it becomes clear that you have no more use for her, you can always divorce her. It's one or the other? One or the other. Well, you're an early riser. - I never went to bed. - You didn't? - I wanted to talk to you. - What about? It's like this. I don't have to tell you how much I'm attracted to you... - Sure, fine. It's OK with me. - It is? - There's nothing better than a good lay before breakfast. But... - Do you or don't you want to? - Of course I want to! I really do like you. You can tell me all that stuff between the sheets. Let's go. - No, Sabine! What I want to talk about is for you and me to... - Oh no. - Yes. - Completely out of the question. I don't mind getting laid. But married! You've got to be joking. You really don't want to? - Oh don't be a pain. I told you, "No". Coming? You will never know what your refusal will cost me. Yes, what is it? - Nicolas. Don't please. No don't. Well my friend. Generally this kindof thing comes about when the gentleman is overworked or from too much lovemaking. If you've made too much love, it certainly isn't with me. So, let's be very charitable, and blame it on overwork. That's what so unforgivable. To get me to come into town on a Thursday afternoon. Put up with the traffic jams, carbonmonoxide, just to have a cup of coffee with a man... I'd appreciate if you'd warn me next time you're overworked. I won't go out of my way for nothing. - Are you trying to tell me, you only come here to see me... - Yes, that's right. Absolutely. - What about... - That's right. Cos when you're in form, you have a certain talent in that realm, which is worth going out of your way for. - Period. - You know the way things are today, that's saying quite a lot. - Come over here. Aren't you going to answer? - You've just said, I work too hard. I suppose it's one of your numerous girlfriends. In that case, nobody knows better than you that... I'm in no condition to entertain her. Come here. - No. - Come on. What if you divorced him? - I thought about it. - Really? Don't sound so pleased. That was long before I knew you. Oh I see. Why didn't you? - I don't know what'd he'd do. - Who? - Georges. What do you think he'd do? - I can't imagine. Kiss me. Hello. - Where the hell have you been? They're looking everywhere. They even called here. - Why? What happened? - Lourceuil's wife just died of a heart attack. We'll need to advise them, so hurry over. - Right. What's with you skipping out on me without saying when we make it next? My room. Like the paper? - Incredible. This is the bathroom. Well, what do you think? - Well, I think it's fine. You haven't said anything. I've already pointed out one bathroom there. - So? But there's two of them, Goofey! Two! Have you ever seen that before? - Never. Julien must think the world of me to do that. - You bet. You might even say he'd do anything for you. - Come on! I'll show you the rest. The living room. - Great. Sit down. Look isn't that chic? - Stunning. Julien is going to be on television tonight. - Is anything wrong? No. ...a discussion of the issues. Our guests tonight will be the two opponents in next week's elections, Mr. Alan Belfond and Mr. Julien Lourceuil of the Union of... Now, what's wrong? - You mean, I can't even watch the television? You want me to go? - I thought that if the apartment pleased you, maybe... you might want to... - What? - Well, he only comes here two or three times a week, you know. - But that would be impossible. If I came to live here Lourceuil would know in a matter of days. Yes, I know you're right. It would have been super, though. - Yes. How have you been doing? Alright? - Fine. It'll never be the same again. ...They don't stand up if you compare... - Look at that. You'd think he'd combed his hair with an egg beater. I even put a comb in his pocket. The Majority at the Foot of the Wall Yes? - I went over the accounts. And it's definite. We won't even meet the payroll. - How much are we short? - The same as last month. 100,000. - I'll get hold of it? - Sales? - No better. The printer has to be paid or we're in for a lawsuit. - I know. - Is that all you've to say? - What? You're in charge of this rag. You throw in a lot of crap about politics. About some guy with ambitions for the House of Representatives. It keeps going under. And you don't feel one way or the other. - I believe you're head accountant here? Of course I'm aware that it's none of business. If you want to sell copy, there is a way of doing it, which you haven't tried yet. - Is that so? - Yeah. There's no point telling your readers what you want to say. It's what they want to read that really sells. What can be simpler? - I want to talk to you after the elections. I'm not being sacked? - You get a raise. - How much? Whatever you want. Hello? Hello, Tanja. How are you feeling? - Bad's how our feel. Always alone, with bad thoughts. With no-one to talk to me either. When do I see you? Tonight? Tomorrow. Tell me what are those two up to, Berthoud and Lourceuil? - I don't know. Are they up to something? - You bet they are. There's a real estate scandal brewing and that explains the eagerness Berthoud has for electing Lourceuil. Have you had lunch? - No. - Come along and tell me all the details. It will be serious if the story gets around and the senator could bring it up any day now. What senator? Lustain. We'll just have to buy him. - No-one can buy Lustain. That is annoying. What do you want? - Your 51% of the newspaper without Lourceuil knowing anything. And I also want him elected. I could make lots of money if I could succeed in silencing Lustain. That's just what I was thinking. - Yes, but I found out that he's completely incorruptible. He never gambles, touches drugs or booze. He has a wife, six kids. - I know. I know. So? - So? I adore corrupting the incorruptible. From the newsroom. The latest election returns. With 63% of the precincts... 46% for Lourceuil. They're still counting but there's no way he can lose. I know. - It will be a sad day for Mme. Hermens. It's too soon. - Oh, we can do without her now. I'm not sure. You might have to wait a while. - What for? OK. Why not? Get rid of her. Go on. Do it! Tanja, I've got a surprise for you! Tanja? You could have waited a little longer. I'll give you full control on two conditions. 1. No staff changes for the moment. 2. That expenses of publication increase by no more than 10%. The layout will still bear my signature and we'll still carry Lourceuil's editorials. As our own? - Oh hello, Gentlemen. - Oh hello. Allow me to introduce our new editor-in-chief, Vischenko? We'll finish our talk later. - If I'm disturbing an editorial session... Don't worry, friend. The worst is over. - Strange. How's the new congress man? - Fine. I should like to discuss a rather delicate subject. - I'm listening. Very delicate. - In that case, sit down. I wonder if you'd be shocked to learn that I was thinking of remarrying. What time is it? - 11.30. Lourceuil wants to marry you. - Are you angry? Of course not. - After all, I did what you told me to. Why should you be? Do you love me? Sure, I love you. Want some coffee? - Want some rolls? I got the keys to a friend's apartment. Do you want to join me there? Close your eyes. - Can't you see that my eyes are closed? I can't see a thing. - Neither can I with my eyes closed. You cheater. You promised. - What are you going to call him? I don't know yet. Sometime back Georges wanted to call him Alexander. It doesn't seem to matter now. - You should call him Francois. Don't you like Francois? - Yes. What's the big hurry? - It's 5 o'clock. Your expecting mistress still has a family that's waiting for her. Corning with me to the bus stop? - No. I'm pouting. OK. Have it your way. When the firemen go by, it's time for lovers to separate. Stay a little longer! - See you. Don't be too unfaithful. Sorry, but I'm still terribly old fashioned. You OK? - OK. Nasty mess. - Yeah. There's a message for you; the attorney of Mrs Hermens is looking for you. What does he want? - Your friend left her house to you. I expected more, but at least it's something. Yeah, at least it's something. OK. Good afternoon Mr. Mallet. - Good afternoon, Denise. Hello, Nicolas. Denise will you put these in a vase and put them on the piano? Yes, Madame. - You know he's simply furious? - Is he? You will go easy on him, won't you? He takes everything so seriously now he's a representative. Really kills him. Hello. What do you call that? Singer's Lover... On my front page? I've heard from all my friends. The speaker of the House was even on the phone. I can't permit that. My name's appearing... By the way, where's my editorial? Where did you put it? Page 11. After the obituaries. After the obituaries? That issue had a pressrun of a quarter of a million. - A quarter of a million? You don't mean it? - It's been sold out for hours. Well, I'll be... That's marvellous. Are you keeping the costs down, or? I reduced the staff by half. I hire almost everyone from agencies. And the ads? Are they coming in? - I have more than we can use. Fabulous! But just one thing... What? Don't put me with the obituaries again. I'll be in town tomorrow to do some shopping. - Pick me up at the office at 6. You moved into a new place, I hear? - That's right. Did you pay a lot for it? - The house? A fortune. I'd love to kiss you right now. - Not here. You know, with Julien, in bed, it's finished. Right, print it. - What comes after that? What's for next week? "Jackie Onassis separated from children" - Yeah. How's that? She sent them off on a skiing vacation. - Mm. Right. And after that? - "Brigitte Bardot enters a convent." What's the story there? - Some bull. She went to visit some cousin who works there in the kitchen. - Fine. And then what? "Princess Margaret has child with two heads." - Two heads? Yes? I put your call through Sir. - Mr. Fabre? - Yes, on two. - One second. Then it's because an artist did a portrait of the kid with two heads? Is that it? - That's it! - Sold. Thanks. Hello Fabre? What's become of you? I haven't heard from you in quite a while. What's that? - A cheque. The newspaper is selling like hot cakes. Lourceuil's two companies are minting money, decent return on all investments. And all that, thanks to you. - So what? I didn't want to make money out of it. - I know that, but take it anyway. What do you want me to do with it? - Whatever you like. Did you see that? Shirley Douglas in Paris for Premiere She's in town for the premiere of her latest film. - Do you know what I did every afternoon after school? - No. I used to go to the headmaster's for tutoring. I even flunked Latin so I could be tutored. And that way, maybe I'd see Marie-Thérèse, the daughter of the headmaster. You know what you could do for me? To make me happy? Screw her. It won't be easy. She thought she was pretty hot stuff when she was a little kid, so by now... She won't be a Marie-Paule, or Rob... She won't be like Flora. Don't try to understand. Just do what I ask, will you? And after I come back and tell you the whole thing. Right? That's right. What do you know? Now you've slept with a star. Disappointed? - Yes. But it wasn't the star I wanted to sleep with. - It wasn't? When your father was headmaster, do you remember the student who came to your house for tutoring? - No sweetie. Are you the one'? - No. I wonder what the hell ever became of the headmaster's daughter. It's long ago. You know what? It's a pretty weird joint you've got. It's an inheritance. Here. Do you mind calling me a taxi? May I come in? - Of course. - I was at the hospital. He'd a stroke earlier this morning and been in a coma ever since - Lourceuil? The doctors say that he'll never regain consciousness. Want something to drink? - No thanks. - You shouldn't be here. There's one thing I have to tell you about. It wasn't important before. But now, with Julien's going to die and I'll be rich... For the rest of my life, I'll be alone. - What are you talking about? He left me all his money, but on one condition. That I must never remarry. No. Why would he do a thing like that? - Jealousy, old boy. Did you change your aftershave or did you have a visit? The housekeeper was here. - Balmain! Do you know what a housekeeper costs these days? You louse! Lourceuil won't pull through. - Ah. He's been in a coma for hours. Perfect. Madame Hermens, Lourceuil, his wife, Groult. It's a massacre. You see nobody ever dies nowadays except in comedies. With Lourceuil I figured it would be a bit longer. - Marie-Paule's coming over to see me later on. - Here? - No. Why? - No reason. You still have to take the most important step yet. To marry her. Marie-Paule? - It's obvious. With all you got with the fortune Lourceuil will have left to her, practically nothing can block your success. There we are. - There we are. And then what? Then what? - I marry Marie-Paule and I wind up even richer. And then what? You'll be... I don't know. You'll buy up the rail roads, or the stock-exchange or the city of Lisbon. How do I know? This calls for a drink. - Andreas. Champagne! Champagne? - The best you've got. We're now selling a million copies a day. - Really? How was Shirley Douglas? - Impossible to make her. Let's hear about it. - You were right. She wasn't born yesterday. I tried everything. No way of screwing the beautiful Shirley Douglas. - Absolutely not. Well, to tell you the truth, I prefer it that way. You do? Here's to Shirley Douglas, the headmaster's daughter. And to you. And to Marie-Paule. No, no. Let me pay. - No, it's... - No, I'll take care of it. I'm paying for it and you know why. That was the one thing I ever asked you to do for me and you weren't even able to do that. So long. You were lying? - That's right. It cost me a cocktail party, a story on a drug scandal for page one as well as a diamond necklace. - Well? Shirley Douglas has a beautiful figure but with nothing inside. OK. I'll come by tomorrow. I won't be here. I'm going on vacation. Move aside. What happened? - He blew his brains out in the alley behind the cafe. You wanted to see me? Tomorrow's front page. "Claude Fabre is dead. The brilliant lecturer and novelist took his life in..." Are you putting me on? - No-one asked for your opinion. Just because a guy put a bullet through his head... - Front page! In type like that! - I wouldn't if I were you... - Vischenko! I want that item on page one for the following reason. I am the publisher and owner of the god-damn rag and that is what I want. I know the bunch of pinheads who read this paper don't want this sort of thing and I don't give a damn if they don't. Even if they don't care and aren't interested, they are going to hear about Claude Fabre. Is that absolutely clear? - Absolutely. We'll stop press right away. I'll scrap the old front page and print a new one. Jerome! Jerome, do you remember me? - No. - Are you a good boy? Yes. Goodbye. - Bye. Afterwards, if you want, we can go and look at the trains.
