He's not all that bad. - It can swim... - PD was swimming really fast today. This... Japanese spider crab... PD is a superhero. The chin... The chin, Romi. Point it ahead. Chin up. No, the back has to be straight. - Come on, Romi. - Yes, Mamma. - The bus is here. I've put your homework book... - Romi... - The 'poha' is delicious. - Romi, 'poha'. - Bye, PD. - Do eat the 'poha'. - Yes. - Don't leave it. - Let's go. Bye, dear. Bye, Mamma. As soon as he gets on the bus, kiss hard. Give Romi a kiss. A flying kiss. - Bye, PD! - Bye, PD! - Bye, PD! - Bye, PD! - Bye, PD! - Bye, PD! - Bye, PD! - Bye! Bye, PD! Bye! - PD, come on! - It's my turn! - Again, one, two... - Aim! And here goes... - Yes! - What a shot! - What's this? - Good shot. Mom, these are marbles. This is how you play... Romi, are you done learning? I'm done 'studying', Mummy, not 'learning'! It's incorrect grammar. Watch your uncle, dear. Ms. Anna, his timing for music class has changed. It's at 6 now. Yes. There you are! - That was cheating! - I'm a champion! - That's a shot! - I'm a champion. Did you see that? I still have a chance left. - No way... - Try again. Try again. One, two, three! Yes! Ballu, did you return the cooker? Ballu, did you return the cooker? I don't know, let me cook. Anna, can you please grate the bottle gourd? Yes. What are you cooking? It looks good. We're making 'Shahi Lauki' and 'Channa Kofta', Timmy. It's PD's recipe. I thought I should try it. Balu, this man PD is very talented. Of course. He's been managing Anna's house so well. Food, yoga, night-walking, swimming... Romi's homework too. But since PD has come, Romi hardly visits us. That's my only complaint. What do children need anyway? A little love and attention, that's it. But he always had love and attention. He never lacked it. Dear, you made sure he never lacked anything. - You're the world's best mother. - Of course. We meant to say that Romi has a new friend now. Right? We meant to say that Romi has a new friend now. Right? Yes, absolutely. Do you want to try it? These orange-flavoured tablets are great. - See you, Ms. Anna. - Hold on. Thank you for doing Romi's homework. I mean, I couldn't focus on him because of my project. You don't have to thank me. Teaching is a piece of cake for me. But I must tell you that the homework is too much for a student of class 1. If they could allocate some time to games like Ludo and chess it would be great. We'd play a little. PD, this is your problem. You're going off track. What do you mean? I mean, why are you playing with marbles? I don't approve of these games. Ms. Anna, we don't do it for fun. It teaches a great deal. I mean, chess helps strategize. If you play Ludo and Snakes and Ladders you learn numbers. - Hopscotch helps strengthen the legs... - Oh, God, PD! You don't have to do fun things. That's why you're here. That's why you're here. Don't you understand such a simple thing? - I'm trying, Ms. Anna. - How? By playing with marbles? What can I do if it's not working out? It's not my fault. I've been trying my best. I'm making an effort... Try harder. We're losing time. I don't have time. Ms. Anna, I have left no stone unturned. I didn't work so hard even for my MD and MA exams. I'll talk to you later. - I have to go now. - Where are you going? I have to go to Romi's football match. - Are you interested in football? - No. Are you the coach? - No. - Then? Fine, I won't go. I promised him. I'll break my promise. Let him wait. I won't go. There you are. I'm mean now. This is what you want. - Come on! - Come on! Taking the penalty kick is Romi from Blue House! What is this little guy going to do! Yeah! - Goal! - Shit! Well done, kids! Hold on. Hold on. Why did you jump early? We lost because of you. Why don't you take charge? Listen, come here. Come! - Come on, run! - Move! - Run! - Come on! And goal! And goal! Run! Stop him. Mamma! Cheater! Romi? What are you doing here? Aren't you sleepy? Are you upset with me? I'm sorry. I said, I'm sorry, Romi. I was really going to come. I was ready. I was about to leave, but... Something important came up, so I got busy. Listen, scold me if you want. What happened? What happened? Dear, you're hurt. Didn't you tell mamma? Did you fall while playing? You haven't even applied an antiseptic... Romi. What happened, dear? Romi... Romi... Dear, listen... Romi... Dear, listen... Tell me what happened. Look, you can share anything with me. Anything. Right? Promise? Now tell me. Tell me, dear. Parth, Shakey and Deepak are students of grade 5. They are bigger than me in size. They always tease me. They mock me. They trouble me. And today, at the match Parth kicked me really hard on my leg, on purpose. Over here. Oh, my God! It's red. Sir showed him the red card and ousted him from the match. So, dear, that was good, wasn't it? But then, at the staircase, the three of them... What did they do? Hey, Romi! Come here! Quick! Trying to be a hero! I got the red card at the match because of you! - What about that? - I didn't do anything. Have you forgotten how I splashed water on you? It looked like you peed. Everyone laughed. Now I'm going to stick chewing gum on your hair. You'll come to school bald, understand! I don't think you've understood. Turn around! Mamma! Romi didn't do anything. You should have slapped them right then. You should have bashed them up. But mamma says good boys don't fight. To hell with good boys. Okay? Now get this clear. If any boy comes to hit you for no fault of yours then slap him really hard. Grab his hand, lock it here, legs below take the name of Lord Shiva and pin him down. Checkmate. I'm scared. You're scared. - What's this? - This will drive your fears away. Take this. This will always stay with you. Hold it. Close your eyes. Whenever you're scared, hold it tightly. Okay? Will you come to save me? Okay. I promise. I'll come. Are you scared now? Come here. Sit. Let me tell you a story. Okay. In a far off village, there was a little boy. Napoleon Bonaparte. Big boys would hit him with snowball. And one day, he... Give it to me. Give me! Give it to me! Give me! Gogi, take your tiffin. Hail Lord Shiva! Very disappointing. I feel the same way, ma'am. What kind of a family and upbringing this child has! What kind of a mother are you? You teach your child violence at home? Romi, did you hit him? But Mamma, Shakey and Parth, every day... Ma'am, he's lying. That day, he chanted 'Hail Lord Shiva' and thrashed me so much over here... Oh, God! See, he hit him so much, his body is swollen. I'm tired of icing it. Ma'am, this is a very serious matter. Mummy, he's lying. - His friends and he... - Quiet, child. Mrs. Kapoor and Mrs. Roy Choudhary Mrs. Kapoor and Mrs. Roy Choudhary we have a zero-tolerance policy in our school. The school will not tolerate such behaviour. To the children and the parents this is my first and last warning. - Yes, ma'am. - Please go to your class. But we need to discuss this problem. Hello. - Hello, Romi. - Hello. Have you lost all your manners? Can't you take a glass and drink? Come here! Come here now. Why did you hit him? Haven't I told you a zillion times? No violence. No violence. No violence. No violence. No violence. No violence. And what did Shakey say you were screaming? 'Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva!' Where did you learn all this? Oh. So it's you, Mr. Dwivedi. This is what you've taught him. Mummy, it's not PD's fault... You keep quiet and go to your room. Who the hell do you think you are? Are you trying to make my son a street fighter? - No, but... that stupid boy started it... - Stupid. Stupid boy. Is this the kind of language you use in front of Romi? What else have you taught him? Just tell me everything right now. I'm not good with surprises. PD cooks, PD helps with yoga, PD takes care of the house. PD! PD! PD is a hooligan! PD takes care of the house. PD! PD! PD is a hooligan! Ms. Anna, taking a stand for yourself is not hooliganism. - What my mother taught me... - Your mother... Whatever she taught you, keep it to yourself. I'm Romi's mother, and don't teach me about parenting. You're an unemployed man. God knows if you want to be something in life or not. And you're trying to teach me? You're right, Ms. Anna. I am teaching you parenting. Because you really need it. How dare you. Just go pack up and leave. Get out of here. Ms. Anna. I will leave, but first, I'll say what I have to. I will leave, but first, I'll say what I have to. Because to some extent, both you and I are responsible for what's happened. - I don't need your lectures. - I'm not lecturing. Don't you know how many battles you're fighting in your life right now? All of us are fighting our own battles. Do you know how educated I am? I worked so hard. I was a state rank holder. And look at what I'm doing now. I don't have a job, no house, no money. I'm staying in your house as a papa on rent. I'm tired of proving myself. Is this not a battle in itself? What should I do? Stop fighting? Should I quit and leave? Some battles are very important and to win them, you need to trust yourself. And the foundation of this trust has to be laid in childhood. When you're a child. And yes, my mother taught me all this. You have a lovely son. He can't see you troubled. You have a lovely son. He can't see you troubled. That's why when anyone troubles him in school when they hit him and hurt him he doesn't share it with you. Because he... - Romi. - Yes, Mamma. Have a good day, okay? Be a good boy, okay? Have a good day, okay? Be a good boy, okay? Don't share your lunch with anyone. Eat it yourself. I've set your hair... It's fine, Mamma. Hey. The next time your child touches my son you'll get tired icing him all night. Do you understand? Do you understand or not? Shakey, go to your class. And don't you dare touch him again! - I'll thrash you. Go now. - Fine. I'm sorry, PD. I'm sorry, PD. Good morning. Good morning. I've made nice tea for you. It might not be as good as yours, but... I'm sorry. I got a bit too aggressive yesterday, I was angry. You need not apologise. You're the mother. I'm just an arrangement. No... You're right. Inner strength Inner strength having faith in yourself is very, very important. You see, PD my world revolves around Romi. And I've worked really hard to make sure all his desires and wants are fulfilled. Look, Ms. Anna, you don't have to explain to me. Who am I? Just hear me out. I brought the two-and-a-half-month old Romi here to my grandma's house. I didn't go to Kolkata because mom and dad would get worried. I didn't go to Kolkata because mom and dad would get worried. I started my business from home. With Armeen. Uncle and aunt really supported me. All these years I raised Romi the way I thought was right. There was no one else's point of view. Look, in a normal family both parents raise a child together. But I've been Romi's mother, father, sibling, everything. Helping him with homework, taking him to the doctor going grocery shopping, buying underwear fighting with the plumber, I mean, everything. And I'm not saying this for sympathy. It's damn... damn tough. Ms. Anna, I understand... Sorry. Perhaps, while being a single parent I became the serious type. That's why Romi doesn't see me as a friend. Ms. Anna, it's nothing like that. Romi... Something must have been lacking. But thank you. You made me realise it. Tea. Thank you again. For being Romi's friend. For him, you're not an arrangement. You're a friend. Yes, Ms. Anna. Anna. Call me Anna, please. Okay. The tea is good. - Incredible! - What? I mean, it's delicious. The 'poha', right? Yeah, it's very good. 'Poha Jalebi' is very famous in our town. Us Bengalis mostly make sweets using condensed milk. Condensed milk. 'Poha' is good. But I really hope that after some time, we can start talking about other things besides 'poha' and condensed milk. Yeah. I'm saying as a friend. It'll be nice, right? - Sure. - Just as friends. Romi, is everything all right? Mamma, I'm flying like a superhero! Talk to PD. - Hello. - Hi. Did you two have dinner? We've had dinner, brushed our teeth. And what time is it now? - Laughter time! - Laughter time! I'll come early. It's Sunday tomorrow. Just enjoy. - Mamma, you enjoy. - Yes. Okay. - Thank you. - Come on, PD, let's go. Okay, listen, it's our laughter time. I'll talk to you later. Come on! Oh, she's here. One more shot. - One more... - Okay! - And cheers! - Cheers! I'm loving it! Hi. Did he sleep on time? I hope he didn't trouble you. You two had a lot of fun, didn't you? I enjoyed a lot too. I mean, after a very long time I had a girls night out. You know what that is? Gossip, bitching! - Good. - I mean... What's that constellation called which looks like a question mark? 'Saptarishi' (Ursa Major). - 'Sattarishi'. - 'Saptarishi'. 'Saptarishi'. Okay. I love stargazing. I mean, you know, there's a connection. We're all made of stars after all. So, it's natural to be attracted to them. You know the stories of all these stars, don't you? Not all the stars. But I do know that every star has its own story. What's your story? Tell me. - Tell me. - What do you mean? You're not married. Any girlfriends? Tell me. When I was in college, I had a lover. Girlfriend. - Her name was Swati. - Swati! Not bad! Then? I was in love with her for four years. Then she married someone else. Why? I could never tell her. Then, girlfriend? This is how it is in small towns. When we fall in love with someone in our head, we consider them our lovers. So, you're still a virgin? I never said that. So, it's lust. What are you... What are you saying? What's the matter? Everyone has such secrets. Listen, you're very shy, okay? This way you'll never be able to have a girlfriend. I don't want a girlfriend. Listen... At night, our ancestors wander around us. And I don't want them to know my secrets. Right? You're so boring. Fine! Good night. PD. I can't sleep. Let's talk. 'These days...' 'I can't sleep at night.' 'Walk into my dreams, and I'll be able to sleep.' 'I've written letters' 'but I don't have your address.' 'Come and whisper it in my ears, and I'll be able to sleep.' 'I've heard from strangers' 'that your dear ones are very close to you.' 'Just call out to me from afar,' 'and I'll be able to sleep.' Slowly, colours fill the sky Slowly, the clouds pass by 'Parathas!' 'Parathas!' 'Parathas!' Incredible! It's too good. Slowly, silences seem to be humming Slowly, when you seem to be coming Slowly, my dreams came true Slowly, life doesn't seem blue Slowly, my fate seems anew Slowly, moments of solitude are few since I became yours Since I became yours Since I became yours Since I became yours Beloved, we seem to be making a connection, slowly Beloved! Since I've found you, I feel relieved I've found a friend in you, I truly believe. Beloved Beloved! Slowly, a special person has arrived Slowly, my aspirations seem alive Slowly, my aspirations seem alive Slowly, life seems surprisingly pleasant Slowly, it's all because of your presence Since I became yours Since I became yours Since I became yours Since I became yours Beloved! Yes, Mr. Shagun. I need it with low back. And fix a string on it too. Deliver it earlier, not on the night of Diwali. Yes, I'll give you the measurements right away. Romi! Measuring tape... Romi, please bring a scale, dear. Romi has gone with uncle to buy sweets. - Scale. - Thank you. How much is this? Can you please help me with the measurements? Can you please help me with the measurements? Just this portion. Just... Exactly here. - In centimetres? - Yes. 2.75. Okay. 2.75. And the back? What's the back's measurement? - From where? - From here. Yes, below... - Oh, I'm sorry... - I couldn't hold it. May I? - From here? - Yes. - Until? - No, further down. Yes, exact. - Over here? - No, further down. - Here? - Yes. - How much? - 26. Shoulder, please. - Yes. - Hold it properly or the measurement... - Yes. - Hold it properly or the measurement... - Yes... - It's 15. - A little more. - Over here? 30... - Here? - Yes. How much? - 38. - 38. 38. No, please. The 'lehenga' needs to be measured too. Yes, that's fine. - Until where? - This... Okay, I'll do it. 30... 75. It's 87. - Thank you. - Yes... Thank you... Without her, I feel restless at night Yet she doesn't come Yet she doesn't come Yet she doesn't come Surprise... Mom and Dad! Greetings! Please come in. - Greetings. - Come. Take this. Give that to him. - Please come in. - It's heavy. Take this too. And this. - Give me. - No, not this... Please come in. Hey, look, we gave her this. - When we came the last time... - Yes. Come, please sit. Have a seat. - Keep this. - Yes, I'll keep it. - Would you like some tea? - Yes. - Without sugar. - Without sugar. Okay. You just blabber all the time. Wow! Anna's house is so beautiful. She has even hired a cook. True. Her house looks so beautiful. Yes. Hey, what's your name? Well... Prajapati Shankar Dwivedi. Mister, come here for a minute. Where's ma'am? - Keep it. - She's at office. Tea. Have tea and calm down. Well... What is it? - No... How's the tea? - It's nice. The tea is good. - What's so funny? - No, actually... Your pronunciations seem different. It's nice to hear. Yes, we're Bengali. Our vocabulary is different. Yes, Bengali vocabulary is different indeed. I mean, when you speak Hindi, it's weird. Shut up. You're mocking our culture and us. No, I'm sorry. Hey, listen. Go bring me this medicine from the pharmacy. - Why do you start arguing with everyone? - You be quiet. - Why did you have to chit chat with him? - I didn't. You were talking to him about Bengalis. - What's the problem with Bengali? - Okay, fine. - Hello. - Anna, where are you? I'm on my way home. What happened? Your parents are here. They wanted to surprise you. And they think I'm your servant. What's this? Don't worry, PD, I'm coming. - Dwivedi. - Yes. Here are Ms. Anna's clothes. Why should I take them? You take them. And it's 'Mr. Dwivedi'. - I'm a teacher. - What's wrong with him? He takes the clothes every day. I don't understand. What do you mean by trial period? Runa, give her a chance to explain. You've been scolding her since she has come. You be quiet. You be quiet. All this forward thinking through the years - has led to this nonsense, I'm telling you. - Mom, chill. Chill. I did what I felt was right for Romi at that time. That's it. You did what you thought was right for Romi? What's right about this? You just brought home a random guy to be his papa. What... You've already given him the house keys? Softly, Mom. I'm... I'm... - Here are your medicines. - Thank you. The house keys. Thank you. Hey, boy. Where do you think you're going, inside the house? I... You guys talk. I'll go to my room. Your room? - Mom... Mom, just... - What do you mean by your room? Don't shush me. No, this is just not acceptable. You have nothing better to do. You're roaming around here as a father. Have you ever thought about what the neighbours will say and think? Uncle and aunt are fine with it. So what? What will Mr. Keshto think? Mr. Keshto? I mean, he's your neighbour. How does that matter? - Look at her. - Exactly. How does it matter? - You calm down. - No, I won't. All this is unacceptable, I'm telling you... Just... - Hey... - PD! - Romi... - Carry me. Carry me. - Romi... - Carry me. Carry me. - Okay, come... - Carry me... Carry me. Carry me. Yes... Romi... First, you have to meet your grandparents. He's grown so big... - Romi! - Grandpa! Grandma! Romi, my dear, come, give me a hug... - Go... - Come here, come to me... Come here, come to me. Grandpa, Grandma, Gogi and I have been selected for the Annual Day. We'll perform on stage like rock stars. We'll perform on stage like rock stars. Wow! Look, the invitation cards. One for mamma. One for papa. PD, it's to my favourite song, Believer. It goes like this... "First things first..." PD... - I'll serve... - I love this song. - It's my favourite song. - Food... - Listen to me, PD. - Hold on a minute. I'll go eat on my terrace... I mean, your terrace... - Dear, I'll go... - Come on... I have to tell... - Okay, fine... - I have a secret to tell you. Yes, let's freshen up and change first. - Then we'll talk. - You'll listen to me then? I'll listen to everything you have to say. He's a nice guy, Mom. If he's that nice, marry him. I'm telling you, he has a different plan. Just bang your head on your damn pot! What's the matter now? Hey, boy. Hey, you. Come here. Come here. Sit. Sit down. What are you doing here? I was hungry, so I came to get a biscuit. No, I mean, what are you doing in this house? Why did you come to this house? - What's your plan? - Plan? Plan... Look, I understand everything. Look, I understand everything. This huge house has been transferred to my name by Anna's grandmother. And I will give it to Romi. Runa, why don't you come to the point? This is the point. There are no free lunches here. What did you think? Since Anna is alone you can fool her and usurp this property? You're misunderstanding. I mean... This plan of trial period is Anna's plan. And this arrangement is her helplessness. There's nothing between us. That's it, enough, I understand everything. Let him speak. Go on. I understand that you're angry. You're a mother after all. And a mother always wishes to teach the right thing. And a mother always wishes to teach the right thing. So? Where are your parents? Do they know that they have a grandchild? My father passed away long ago. I had a mother, but... She passed away... just recently. Look, Prajapati... We don't have a problem with you. Whatever Anna did, whether right or wrong it's under pressure. But this is all temporary. You two, you're not married. So, when you leave this house in the future So, when you leave this house in the future what is Romi going to do? Have you ever thought about that? I'll go. Hey, Prajapati! Happy Diwali! Happy Diwali, Uncle! I've brought you special 'laddus' made of pure ghee especially from the Bengali market. Uncle, I don't feel like it. Didn't you get the good news? Why are you sulking? I just don't get you. You've got a job, it's the festival of Diwali You've got a job, it's the festival of Diwali You no longer have to be a slave here, Goddess Saraswati is impressed Goddess Lakshmi has blessed you. What else do you need? Uncle, today... - Today is the last day. - So? Oh... Have you gotten too close to them? Hey... No... Calm down... No, relax... No... So what if it's the last day?

Mom and dad, whenever they are there for Diwali, it's too much fun. Oh, today is an extremely special situation. Oh, today is an extremely special situation. Associate Professor Prajapati Shankar Dwivedi. Not bad. Love is a choir, it only hurts "Quagmire". What does that mean? It means, don't fall in love with just anyone. Love is similar to an ant getting stuck in jaggery. It never comes out. Love is like jaggery. And what if it still happens? In this song, the poet is trying to say that you shouldn't fall in love. - What should we do then? - I don't know. Come on, PD, go to sleep. You've had enough. And tomorrow is your first day. Come... Anna, what's this? Between you and me, this arrangement... A babysitter? A freeloader tenant? A friend. We're friends, PD. Friends? - PD... please. - Anna. I feel like the ant, and you're jaggery. And sometimes, you're the ant and I'm the jaggery. We've been constantly running towards each other. We're so complete, aren't we? Don't spoil it. Please. So you tell me, Anna. What's this bond? What are we? I don't like these girlfriend and wife kind of relationships. Do you like me, Anna? Good morning... - Good morning, students. - Good morning, sir. So, what are we starting with? The History of Napoleon Bonaparte. - Can I tell you a story? - Yes, sir. So, in a far off village there was a little boy. Mamma, I want to talk to PD. It's my Annual Day. Please, Mummy. Just once. - No, Romi. - Please, Mummy. - Romi? - Please. I said no, Romi. Romi! Romi! Romi... What is wrong with you? You're so stubborn! What are you doing, Anna? I don't know, Mom. I don't know. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry, dear. Don't cry. No... Be frank with me. Tell me what happened. It's all my fault. Trial period, temporary papa... It was a stupid plan. I'm a fool. I'm a fool. Look, dear everyone isn't perfect. People make mistakes. He proposed to me. He didn't even stay back to listen to my reply. Why? Why should I trust him? I'm sorry, Romi. Why can't I talk to PD? He's got a new job. He's busy now. Why are all papas always busy, Mamma? Mamma. You'll always be with me, won't you? Always. Good morning, parents, and a very warm welcome to Spring Hill School's Annual Day function. And here today, to win your hearts with their performance, we present the rock stars of the junior school.
