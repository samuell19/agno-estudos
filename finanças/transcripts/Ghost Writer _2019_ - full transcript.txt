Please take good care of the house. Okay. Sorry, I can't accompany you there. -It's alright, Sir. -Okay. -Okay? -Alright, I'll go ahead, Mr. Harja. -Thank you so much. -Okay. Those are the new occupants. What do you think? Awesome, right? "Spinning the Star by Naya" See that thing squatting under the tree? That's a pocong. A pocong can do squatting? Pocongs jump. Maybe he's tired of jumping. It's still impossible. Pocongs have slim fit shroud wrapping. Maybe he's standing, but... Maybe he's a midget pocong. The midget ones are tuyul. What's wrong with a midget pocong? There's no height requirement to be a pocong. You think he's in the army? Or perhaps that's a tuyul dressed as a pocong? Hey. You two are so lame believing in such things. Believe me. If Mrs. Broto finds out, she'll sprut you out. Spurt out? Am I a firetruck? Ma'am. Why haven't you revised this script? I've already told the writer. She said your idea.... ...is too much like a telenovela. What do you mean telenovela, Alvin? I just asked that in the end... ...the female lead gets pregnant and amnesiac. Such thing happens on a daily basis. It's not like we're using the "What?" zoom effect. The what effect? "What?" Zoomed! "What?" Zoomed! Now that's a telenovela. Okay. So we use the "What?" zoom effect? Use it. Don't use it. Right, don't use it. "Sir, when can I receive my royalty? Naya" Hello, Sir? About your royalty, it should be approved tomorrow, but since this is your third year, the amount won't be too large. Yes, Sir. I understand. Right. How about my script? About that... Why don't we talk about that here? You'll come by the day after tomorrow, right? Definitely. Why don't you make a new synopsis for our discussion material? -Okay, Sir. -Thanks. To, your ball. To? Naya? This house is big, but why did they lease it for a low price? Isn't it suspicious? No. Put on some music or something. It's too quiet here. Okay, I'll play a song. Not that song! It's so creepy! Turn it off! Gosh, Darto. You're still a scaredy-cat. There! What's that noise? Did you hear it? What noise? I didn't hear anything. There! How can you not hear that? Maybe that's our food delivery. Go get it. No way. Fine, I'll get it. I'm coming with you. It's scary here. What's so scary? What if it's not a person? It's alright, To! Just a minute, I'll get the money. Alright. Don't worry, Sir. It must be the light bulb. But it's true, Sir. People say... ...when the lights are blinking... ...there are spirits approaching. Approaching? What for, Sir? Group study! How should I know? Ask them yourself. What do you have to be afraid of? It all depends on your faith. If you have a strong faith, nothing will... -What was that? -Don't hurt us, please! Sorry, I got carried away. Excuse me. Gosh! Thank you. Look at you. Cuddling in the rain? Gross. I'll never hug you again. You better keep your words. Easy with the dramatic entrance. I know you're an actor. Bro, what were you filming? The usual. Telenovela. To make money. Let me see your telenovela acting skills. Come on, just a little. What did you say? I just arrived here, I'm all wet! I haven't even dried myself, and you ask me to act already? But you're an actor, Bro! An actor! You can't do that much? What? You underestimated me? How dare you! Cut! Enough. Hi. Your acting was great. You, study some more. I was doing great! What more do you want? And you, go get change. I haven't unpack my clothes. We have Darto's. You can borrow them. Will they fit? Of course they will. What's wrong? See, they fit. Nay, they fit. What do you mean fit? Your belly is out! You don't know fashion. This is called air vent. It keeps you cool all day. What do you think about your new place? Is it nice? -It's nice. -No. Well, if you're not comfortable or not happy with it, you can find a better place. If you want, you can use my savings, it's alright. As if you don't know, Vino. She'll lose her pride if she accepts other people's help. She has no money, but has an ego as big as Hotman Paris'. No need, Vin. We're just not used to this place yet. It will feel like home eventually. Right? Nay, do you remember Franky? I do. Franky is starting his advertising agency. There's an opening for a copywriter position. What do you say? I'll pass, Vin. I want to focus on writing my novel. Are you sure? You need... I'm sure, Vin. I just want to help you. It's hard. She's so stubborn. -Just like you. -Hey! What? You share the same gene. (Active balance: 4.210.500 rupiah) "Synopsis" Naya! Naya! What's with you? I'm the one who should be asking! The faucet! What's wrong? It's on. Then it's good! I mean, the faucet was turned on by its own! I'm sure this house is haunted! Well, maybe so, this is an old house. As long as we don't do anything bad, they won't disturb us. What do you mean they won't disturb us? The faucet was turned on by its own! Well, just turn it off. Enough, trust me. You will be alright, okay? But I'm scared. Can I sleep here? Okay. I'll sleep in your room. Come on! You asked for it. Hey, wash your face. No, let it seeps in. "Doctor Surya, you advised me..."| "...to write down all feelings and thoughts that come across my mind." "But it made me confused..." "...because my feelings and thoughts," "they're all empty." "Since I was young, Mother never liked me." "And after that incident," "Mother hated me even more." "The truth is, I also hated myself." "I think I should stay away from Mother..." "...rather than keep reminding her of that incident." "Father still believes that things will go back to the way they were before." "But I know it's impossible." "I never wanted to be anyone's burden." "Especially Father and Mother." "Maybe I should leave this world." "Only then, everyone would be happier." Poor guy. But are you alright? Do you have another problem? I'm just wondering. What happened to him in the end? "You insolent brats, get out of here now!" Okay, I believe you. But where should we go at this hour, To? Any place would do. We can find a hotel, then look for another rent house tomorrow. Or... ...we can stay at Vino's place. I've told you, we shouldn't be anyone's burden. Vino is your boyfriend, not a stranger! Naya, please. Wait, listen to me. Naya, please! Darma Farianto! I understand that you're afraid. I understand you very well. But please understand me too. I've paid the rent for a year. My savings are just enough for your school tuition... ...and our daily needs. Not to mention your high school enrollment fee. Fine, you don't have to pay for my school. So you want to be a bum who didn't even graduate junior high? To. You are... Please. Please try to feel at home. But I'm afraid. Fine. I'll be by your side. Excuse me. Forgive my insolence for taking this diary. I'm returning this... ...and I promise I won't touch your stuffs again. But... ...please don't disturb my brother again. He get scared easily. I ask for your cooperation. Thank you. What do you think, Billy? A ghost actually wrote this? Damn, that's scary, To. But look how it rhymes. Here. "Hunting in a flat prairie." "Caught a stripe legged deer." "You insolent brats, get out of here now!" It's a rhyme. Right, just a second. What? Tomorrow's physics homework. Can you ask that ghost to do it for me? A normal person would run away when they have physics homework. Let alone a ghost. How about religion class' homework? It's a ghost, Bill! How can a ghost study religion? I know. Mr. Saidi. Mr. Saidi can work on religion class' homework? Of course I can. What do you think keeps me safe as a night security guard for years? These rings! Just so you know. This one can keep kuntilanak away. And this one, this one's for genderuwo. And this one... ...never leaves my finger since junior high. Is it the most powerful? It's stuck. I can't take it off. I've used soaps. Still, won't come off, but my hands smells nice. Where can I get rings like that? This kind of rings? Nowadays, it's hard to find them. I'll buy you some tomorrow. But I'd say, for your case, rings won't be enough. That ghost in your house... ...need to be exorcised by someone stronger. Can you do it? I can, but you know... ...it's hard for me... ...to find time. When do you want it done? Today. If you want it today, that's not enough. Don't rush into decisions. What are you doing? I'll report you to the Principal. It's nothing, Ma'am. It's under control. You're into this kind of thing? Whatever! I'm not looking! Face that way! This is bad! Okay, see you tomorrow. Yes, Sir. Bill, accompany me tomorrow. Alright! Thank you, Bill. Indeed! Alright! So, how is it going? It's okay if Vino joins us, right? -How are you, Vin? -I'm good. What have you been up to these days? The usual, telenovela. What's the genre? It's "genre". Right, what's the "genre"? The "genre" is... Romance... ...automotive. Romance automotive? -Yeah. -Wow. That's unique. -Very unique. -That's new. Pioneer. What's the title? The title? "My Heart is Stolen by Angkot Driver." -So that's the automotive part. -That's right. Romance automotive. "My Heart is Stolen by Angkot Driver". -The sets were mostly on the street. -Right. But that's good, you get an important role. If they don't have the driver, there won't be a love story, right? -That's right, the driver is important. -Yeah. But I'm not the driver. I got the role as the driver's friend... ...but we are very close. This driver has no friend except me. Still an important role, then. Right. Important. I kept the plot going. Sir, what about Naya? Right, Sir. What about my script? Your script hasn't been approved by Mrs. Broto, Naya. Is that so? Your script is not bad. It's just that your first novel was... ...doing so well. A bestseller, so people have high expectation from you. So your new releases should be as good. Or else, readers will get disappointed, and it will be a flop. Any other ideas? I asked you for a synopsis. -No. -We have one. Really? Yeah. You know, Nay. That story you told me that made you sob. And I was also so moved. -Really? -Tell him. But that was... She just got the idea, it needs to be developed. It's just, I've met my producer. A famous producer in Jakarta. I told him about Naya's idea. He wants to make a movie about it. Wow, and he just heard the idea. Yes! Well... That's amazing. It's best if Naya tells you herself. -Tell him. -What's the story about? Yeah. Well... It's about a guy. He had this diary, and in it, he wrote about how his mother hates him. Until finally... ...he commuted suicide. That's quite dark. Nay. I just wanted to help, Nay. That's not how you do it, Vin. Then how should I do it? Nay. You need story idea. You got a good story here. It's a shame if you don't develop it. But we don't know whose story that is. Exactly because we don't know whose story that is. It's a waste to just let it lay around. It's better if we turn it into something useful. "New Student Admission Fee" I don't mind. I can go to a less expensive high school. No. That's not an option. Adiguna is a great school. Mom and Dad sent me to study there... ...and it's my job to send you to study there too. -Hello, Sir? -Mrs. Broto loves your story idea. If you can finish the draft soon, we can still launch it at Jakarta Book Fair in two months. You know how crowded the event will be? Seriously? I'm serious. What do you say? "Enrollment Form New Student Admission Fee" "Deal, Sir. I'll work on it." Where's Billy? He's having diarrhea. -What? -Diarrhea, Sir. You know, the runny one. I know that. I've had diarrhea too. What I meant was why so sudden? All diarrhea come suddenly, Sir. Who would plan such thing? You have a point. It's not neighborhood meeting. Right, Sir. What about that my ring? Here. -Why is it ugly? -Don't be stupid. In mystic art, the uglier, the more powerful. You think if Limbad gets all dressed up in batik suit, he can eat all those nails? I bet he'll choke on them. You talk too much! Just put it on! Okay. Sorry. Have you been eating toxic waste? I have a bad feeling. I can almost smell it. Those supernatural stink. Come on. Wait. My stomach is upset again. Gosh, you poop a lot like a bird! Hurry up! The ghost might go home already! -Come on! -Come on, Bill. Just hold it in. But let me use your toilet, okay? My toilet collapsed! "Thief!" "SLR. I need to talk." "What is SLR?" "Sorry for the Late Reply" "Why abbreviate it?" "It saves time." Hey! Don't use that one, that's expensive! Here. Use this one. "You make me confused." Why are we chatting like this? Please, I need to talk to you. "SLR" What's SLR now? "Sorry, lamentably refuse." But this is very important. I need your help. Mr. Ghost? Mr. Ghost? Let's chat some more. Ping. Calm down, I just want to talk. Mr. Ghost? What do you want? You want to get rid of her, right? Naya? Naya? To, I need to poop. Please help me. Gosh, can't you just wait? Sir, come with me to the toilet. What the heck? You hire me to exorcise ghost. Not to exorcise poop! What happened to the electricity? To! Come on, let's poop. I'm scared, Bill! I'll do it here then. Don't! What are you doing? Go take this friend of yours! You're so troublesome! Come on! Why do I have to deal with pooping? The price is different. I promise, I won't let them disturb you. But please. Please don't hurt my brother. Gosh. Hurry up, Bill. Gosh, be patient, will you? If I move too much, it'll come out. Where's your toilet? At the corner. Hurry up! Why did they have to build the toilet so far? Gosh. To, come on. Come on what? Come inside with me. Are you nuts? I'll wait outside! To, I'm afraid. It's scary in there. Don't take too long. Okay. Okay, I'll wait outside! To! I just started! To! To, are you still there? What's wrong? What is it? A ghost! -Are you serious? -Yes! Gosh! Your poop stinks! Flush it, please! It's not working! What? What should we do? It stinks so bad! Well, it's either my poop or that ghost. To! To! Thank you for choosing my poop. Please hurry up! To, I'm scared as well, but if you're hugging me like this, my poop won't come out! Right, sorry. -Who are you, Sir? -Damn you... Who are you, Miss? You startled me! I'm the owner of this house. Why are you here without permission? No. I was with... You better leave before I call the neighbors. No, I was with that kid with diarrhea. Or should I call the police? Please don't! Don't bother. You will waste your phone credits. I'll leave. I'm leaving, see? Excuse me. Enough. Enough. I just want to help you. I never asked for your help. Let's run. You can clean your butt later! What do you mean? It'll dry up eventually! -Let's run! -Fine. -Let's go. -I'll count. -One... -Two... Three! Just keep running! It's me. Naya, help us! There's a ghost banging on the toilet's door! That was me. You had to bring that shaman. So I played a trick on you. How could you? What is this smell? I promise I won't bring another shaman. I've never seen such a coward shaman. Whose idea was it anyway to invite a shaman? It was Billy. But you pitched in to pay him. Well, my share was bigger. What's with you two? I'll spend only one night there. Are you kicking me out? It's not like that. Tomorrow, I will call some workers to repair the leaks. So spend some more time there, okay? How long? Well, I don't know. I'll update you. Is it fine with you, Bill? It's alright. It's all under control. Besides, I need a poop buddy. It's settled then. Come on, I'll take you to the front door. -Okay. -Alright. Come on. Excuse me. Here. I brought some offerings for you, Sir. The vendor said they're bestsellers. Please forgive my little brother. I don't eat this kind of thing. You've been watching too much horror movies. So... ...what do you eat? Back then... ...I used to eat rawon. No wonder they call it the Devil's Rawon. About last night, thank you... ...for getting rid of that shaman. My name is Galih. I'm Naya. How about the other one? Who was she? No one. I'm the only one here. I thought there was another one. The scary one. So you think I'm not scary? You're scary. But you're scary in a different way. You are scary... ...in a sweet way. Gosh. I've misspoken. I'm sorry. This is my first time talking to a ghost. It's alright. Thank you for calling me sweet. You said... ...there's something you want to talk to me about. So... ...I need your permission... ...to write your life story as a novel. No. Galih. Wait. Listen to me. Honestly, I wouldn't beg like this if it's not an emergency. These past three years, none of my scripts are accepted by the publisher. Until I told them about your diary. And by doing that, you were out of line. You told others about the content of my diary... ...without my permission. I'm sorry. I know I was wrong. But please give me a chance to write this novel. This story has so much potential, Galih. Let's reverse the situation. What if your diary, the story of your life, is exposed and read by others? Why should I object? I'll be happy if my life story can be beneficial for others. Especially if it can make my late parents proud. Proud? I'm not sure... ...my parents would be proud of me. Why do you say that? Because all my life... ...I was considered a troublemaker for my parents. That's the thing. This novel... ...could be your chance to tell them... ...that their opinion about you was wrong. So... ...what do you say? If... ...you... ...can turn this into a chance for me... ...to tell people... ...what's in my heart and the real truth, I don't mind. But on one condition. I don't want any over dramatization. Got it. By the way, why did you keep this diary in the attic? This diary is very precious to me. Maybe that's the reason. I can see you whenever I touch it. Where should we start? Okay. I get the impression that your mom hates you so much. Why is that? I killed my little sister. Seriously? What's wrong? Are you afraid of me now? Kind of. When I was little, I lived in my grandma's house... ...because my parents were busy working. So I wasn't too close to them. At least until... ...Bening was born. Bening was every parent's ideal child... ...and I was considered as a troublemaker. But I tried to be a good brother. Even so, everybody still blamed me. I don't want to see this happen again. How many times do I have... I chose to go to college far away, in Bandung. One day, Bening had a fight with Mom. She ran away to Bandung. I told Bening, I disapprove of her decision. I called Mom. It must be you who persuaded your sister to run away! And Mom was angry at me. I drove Bening home. Then it happened. Are you stupid? I gave you the signal! -I gave the signal! -No, you didn't! Stop it! We're writing a novel about this story, Sir. So if you adapt it into a movie, it will be a huge hit! Because the readers will go see the movie. We'll have to see about that. The novel may not be a hit anyway. Am I right? I have another appointment. Please excuse me. I can email you the synopsis if you want. If you want to read it, don't be shy. Come closer. I'm not afraid of you anymore. "Up to the point where Galih has to accept..." "Give up?" It sounds too weak. Make peace? That's a good choice of words. Of course. It's me, Galih. I don't know you're so arrogant. That's okay, arrogant is one of our nature. You made a typo. "Interasction." What's that? Oh, sorry. No need to be like that. Keep going, it's alright. Your writing is not bad. Really? Yeah. Would you like to be my ghost writer? Since you're already a ghost. It's not everyday you can get a real ghost as a ghost writer. I feel like a ghost without dignity. You look so down. Have some life spirit, will you? Dead spirit. I mean, have some spirit in general. Naya. Your parents have passed away, right? They got in an accident... ...when I was in high school. So my brother, Darto, and I... ...had to live with our uncle. Our aunt disliked us for being a burden. She called us spoiled brats... ...because our parents didn't raise us well. We decided to leave their house. Since then, I learned to live independently. Live independently or live in pride? Why does everyone keep saying that I'm full of pride? Nay. I'm not "everyone". Yes, Mr. Ghost! Easy with the "ghost" part. It's getting colder. You can feel cold as well? You look so pale. You said you like rawon. Devil's Rawon. Devil's Rawon. Devil's Rawon. But... ...just a little more. Naya... Galih, relax for a minute. We need to rest. Enjoy life. It's nice to be alive. It moved by itself! No, it didn't. I pulled the table cloth. Why am I afraid of your brother now? There, there. Let's continue. Now we need ideas for the title. "What's Wrong With Galih?" What's wrong with you? "Final Apology." Deal? Deal. "Final Apology with Galih." Why do we need "Galih" in it? "Final Apology" it is. -Fine, if you don't need me anymore. -I'll write it now. Why would I do that? I mean it's true. My life is not that fascinating, it's not... Yes! It's finally finished. You finished it? Galih! Congratulations. Thank you so much, Galih. Thank you so much for all your help. Thank you for giving me permission to write this and... Anyway, thank you so much. I don't know what I would do without you. Naya. What are you doing? I'm working out. What kind of work out is that? It's for strengthening wing muscles. Wing muscles? Yeah, here. Try it. No, thanks. My muscles are strong enough. Good afternoon, Ma'am. Good afternoon. Can I help you? I'm the one renting Mr. Harja's house. Miss Naya? Yes, there's a letter for Mr. Harja, but they sent it to the old address. Just a second. Here's the letter. I will leave this to you. Thank you. Yes, Ma'am. I'll go now then. What happened? They say the house owner hanged himself. That's why the spirit is restless. Why is he restless? You country bumpkin. Look. If you die an unnatural death, you'll become a restless spirit. For instance, you die in a sudden car crash. You'll become restless, looking for the one who killed you. He's the same, restless. That's different. How come? If a person died in a car crash, of course he'll become restless... ...because he will look for the driver who hit him. If he hanged himself, who's the one that killed him? Well, himself. Then why did he become restless? He might have some unfinished business. That's even more absurd. Why is that? If he has unfinished business, he's the one who decide his time of death. Why did he commit suicide that day? Why not the next day? Well, it's a sudden decision. That makes even less sense. People don't hang themselves suddenly. You have to plan it. You have to prepare the rope. You have to tie the knot firmly. Go to a higher place, then you hang yourself. No planned things can be called sudden. Yes, there is. What? Tofu balls. Tofu balls are fried impromptu, but they're definitely planned. They use food trucks and frying pan, it's impossible that they suddenly fried tofu balls. But we're talking about hanging oneself to death. About suicide, not tofu balls. Never mind, you know nothing about suicide. Just a second. Do you know anything about suicide? -Come on... -No, I want to ask you! Have you done it? Do you know how it feels? -But you... -Have you ever committed suicide? You know how it feels? No, right? -You don't understand. -You too! You understand even less. But I don't brag. You don't understand. I understand this much. You understand even less. I know this much, you know that much. So noisy. Really! He's so noisy! -What do you think? -Sorry it took so long. So, I've discussed this with Mrs. Broto. Overall, everything's okay. It's just... We think... ...especially the ending, I think it needs to be changed. Changed? Let's make the mother more sadistic. Our readers love dramatization. So they can feel her son's hardship. Make it more exciting to read, Nay. Am I right? The sooner you approve of this, we have better chance to meet the deadline for the Jakarta Book Fair. What do you say? Okay, I'll try to revise it. Okay, let's eat. "Congratulations for your second novel." You're only being used! What do you mean? Cancel the novel at once! Hi. May I know your name? Sorry. I'm not interested. Not interested, you said? After what I did all along, you're not interested? I want you, Nay! I want you! You said you want me? After you impregnated me and left just like that? No, Dear. No. Nay, why do you have to mention "pregnant"? That's too much, people are staring. Everything's under control. Nobody's pregnant. -No. -Just gas problem. Sorry, please continue your chat. Are you done filming? Yes. It's unusual for you, not working at home. I'm trying to get away from Galih. Who's that? A friend. He helped me write. He helped you write? Yeah. So he came to the house? Well... Sure. -How come I... -Just a minute. Let me finish this first, I have a lot to revise. I have to meet the deadline. Okay. Nay. Galih. You surprised me. I'm not trying to surprised you. This his how I usually appear to you. Why do you look so nervous? No, I'm not. I'm okay. So, how was it? What did your editor say? Did he like it? The response is good. He loves it. I'm so tired. I need to rest. This early? Nay? Okay. Sleep well. Galih? You're not playing tricks on me, are you? "Cancel the novel!" Sorry, Miss. You're not done with your drink? Waiter? You can take it. "Mother really loves Bening, but she always avoid interacting with me." "Mother really loves Bening, but she often times torture me." "She often beats me and told me that I bring bad luck." This is the contract. And this... ...is the dummy for the book. I want you to check everything. If you find any mistake, call me right away because we have to print it. -Okay? -Okay. On it. Hey, Vin. What about that thing? You said some movie producer is interested in this. That's right. -That movie producer? -Yeah. Nay. Being silent won't solve the problem, Nay. Why would you lie? Okay, here's the thing. I lied because I don't know how else I can help you. You always refuse my help. But you gladly accept a help from another guy. What do you mean? Galih. You let Galih help you and you never let me. Is this Galih that special for you? Vin, there's nothing between me and Galih... ...and there will never be. Who can guarantee that, Naya? Galih is... Galih is what? Galih is a ghost, Vin. He's the one who committed suicide in the story. He wrote the diary and helped me write this novel. Are you satisfied? I... I don't know what else to say, Nay. I'm your boyfriend, not your fiction novel reader. Okay, you're good at making stories, I know that... ...but this is real life, Nay. "She often beats me and told me that I bring bad luck." I only asked for one condition. One condition. Please let me explain... I thought I can trust you. "Congratulations for your second novel." "Sir, can we just cancel the novel?" "New High School Student Enrollment Form" Naya. I just got back from private lesson. I'm just home to take my clothes. I'll sleep at Billy's house. Careful, don't forget to eat. Okay. Let's go. You said you have some antique collection. Come on, show me. If Naya comes in, hide it. Hang on. Hey, you're not gonna help me get down? You jerk. I should've spend the night here more often. I thought you're a coward, but these magazines make you brave? Actually I'm not a coward, you know? You said there are no more ghost here. Can I scream now? Don't. If Naya finds out about this magazine, I'm done for. The light switch is there. I'll turn it on, wait here. See? It's on. To! Can I scream now? Try to be brave. Look at the magazine. Be brave, okay? Let me turn it back on. There. It's on. To, I can't hold it anymore! I need to scream, okay? Bill, don't you realize you're holding an adult magazine? Damn magazine! It's not much of a fun... ...and I have to face this kind of consequence? Here, I'm giving it back! I still need to scream! Yeah, yeah. Hold on. To, can I scream now? Yes! Naya! Naya! -What happened? -Help me! Wait here! -Yeah. -Help! Help! Please don't hurt my brother! I've deleted it! -Please let him go! -Can you push? Can you push? Help! Careful. I'll go home now. I've deleted it, what more do you want? Who are you talking to? Okay, wait! I know what you want! Sir, I'm canceling my novel! Are you delirious, Nay? I can't explain it now, the point is, this novel must not be published. Nay. I'll call you back, I'm in a meeting, okay? Sir? I've called and asked for the novel to be canceled, but there will be process, please wait! To. Please forgive me. So you're working with a ghost... ...for a novel? Are you insane? I don't get you. To, I know I'm wrong, I'm sorry. But I need this novel, I need the money! For your school tuition, for you. Everything that I've done, it's for you, To. For me... ...or your own ego? I never asked for a fancy school. I never asked for your sacrifice. But if you think of me as a burden, okay then! I can live by myself. I don't have to depend on you. To! Sir, how is it? Can it be done? Of course not, it's about to be printed! Darto! Darto! Naya, help me! Let him go! He has nothing to do with this! Please let him go! Please! Please! Enough. Enough. Galih! Galih, please help! Enough, you'll kill them! I know you're angry, but please! Please help us, Galih. I said enough! Darto! Are you alright? Darto! Darto! To! Bening. Are you alright? This is your first time here, isn't it, Brother? Yes. It's not that I don't want to come here, but what's the point? They moved to this house so they can forget about me and you. I don't see a single photo of us placed in this house. No, Brother. The reason Father moved here... ...and not displaying our pictures, it's because Father worried... ...that Mother might do what you did. I see everyone's here. The neighbors kept blaming Mother... ...and also the news... ...about our deaths... ...made Mother even more depressed. Father only tried to find a new place... ...to make it easier for them. To carry on with their lives. At least they get what they wished for. They can smile again. They are smiling, but that doesn't mean they're happy. Father can hide his feelings very well. You see, until now... ...he never drove your car again. And Mother always try to smile in front of Father. They're trying to get their life back on track. That novel will ruin their effort. But I have a strong reason why I have to get that novel published. Is that more important... ...than our parents' happiness? Don't be selfish! The number you are calling is busy. Please try again later. Bro, I'll take one. -Take care, Bro. -Thank you. "I'm Galih!" Are you ready? I'm ready. Of course I'm ready. Is he here? He is here. It's great if he's here. Okay, you just have to hold this diary. Here's the thing, Nay. This is our first meeting. Now, it is said that first meetings give the most impression. I'm afraid that he'll get the wrong impression from me. You know my intentions are good, right? So you better ask him first if he's bothered by my presence. Are you bothered? He said no. He should be bothered. Well... Just hold this. Tell me how he looks. Give me a hint. About his looks, his appearance. Well, he looks... ...ordinary. But he is a bit pale. -But I still think... -Just see him for yourself. There, there. You said he's a little pale! He's all white and his eyes are red! -Dammit! -There, there. Come here. Easy. Calm down. Easy, careful. Okay. Are you ready? -Okay. -Yeah. We'll touch it together. Okay? Where is he? Open your eyes. Hello. Hi. My hand is dirty. I just wiped my butt. You use your right hand to wipe your ass? I'm left-handed. Well, sometimes, Nay. I need to use both hands for filming purpose. What's wrong? I just want to say... ...thank you... ...for helping me and Naya get back together. Lih, please forgive me. I apologize as well, Nay, because of my sister, you and Darto almost got hurt. The scary one was Bening? Is she scary or pretty? She's pretty, but scary. The reason Bening did all that... ...I think... ...it's because she still hates me. She doesn't want our parents to suffer even more. What do you mean? Our novel... ...will bring up old wounds. The tragedies... ...they've been trying to forget. I know. Come with me now. Come on. Watch this, that viral grandpa video. He married a supernatural being. How is that possible? Well, perhaps that's love. If someone's in love, they should have a crush first. So? When someone have a crush, people say... ...it starts from the eyes to the heart. We're talking about a ghost here. Ghosts have scary look. What made him fall in love? Her moral? That doesn't make sense. We're talking about a ghost here. She behaves like a ghost, evil. No. Ghosts are not evil. Take a kuntilanak for example. She either laughs or cries. What's so evil about that? Well, she scares people. She cry in the middle of the night. Why would she do that? -Sad? -Why would she be sad? Maybe she stepped on chicken poop! How should I know? Okay, fine. Let's say she stepped on chicken poop. Why does she have to cry at night? Well, she stepped on it at night! You think she'd cry the next noon? What's with you? Hey, are you trying to fool me? What now? A kuntilanak can't step on a chicken poop! Why not? She floats! How could she possibly step on a poop if she floats? What's your excuse now? Perhaps that's what makes her sad. She wants to step on a poop, but she can't. That means she hasn't step on it, right? But that makes her sad, right? She's sad, but... Of course she's sad. If you step on a poop... It's so difficult to talk to you! You always have an excuse. Go home. Go home. It's time to go home. Why are you always talk about ghost? I hope you meet a real ghost. You wish. Why would a ghost come to a publisher office? Revising his novel? Get off, I have to work. Sir? Where's Mr. Alvin? He's doing some editing on the rooftop. Just go upstairs. -I'll head upstairs then. Thanks. -Yeah. Hey, this one is done. I will put it here. Got it. What? Those folders just fell on their own! -Seriously? -Seriously! They fell on their own! -You're not scaring me, aren't you? -No, it's true! They were... A ghost? I don't believe it. Galih and his sister don't want their parents to suffer more... ...because of this novel. Moreover, after the revision, we make the mother become more evil. It's called dramatization for better sales. You'll get the royalty, Nay. I don't want my novel reminds others of their trauma. And causing their late children's spirits to become restless. Please, Sir. Gosh. I really don't believe on these things. What do you think? Do I have to? I can do it, but... But... ...you didn't sell enough in Medan, Nay. Medan? Why do we need it in Bataknese? "Bataknese the novel!" Why Bataknese, Nay? "Cancel the novel!" I don't know what app or hacking trick you're using. Whatever trick this is, I don't believe in ghost, okay? I'm not canceling the novel either. Okay. Why don't you see him for yourself? Alright, I'm not afraid. Sir. If I may suggest to you, you better believe what Naya said... -because... -Vino! Save your acting for the telenovela. Don't do it in front of me. It won't work, okay? Sir? Just trust me. What do you say? You want it canceled? Can I delete it? Are we done? -He didn't believe me. -Vino! Come here. What is it? Come with me, I'm scared. Nay. Are you alright? I'm okay. Finally, the novel is canceled. That's Bening. Galih. I think... ...Bening doesn't hate you. She loves you. I can see you whenever I touch this diary. Your most precious belonging. And... ...I can see Bening... ...whenever I touch you. Bening! Bening! Bening! You hate me, don't you? I never hated you, Brother. Not even once. You're a good person. A lot of people love you. So don't give up hope, okay? Lower your ego. Also don't let me see you quit writing novels. I will come and... Naya. Please forgive me. I understand you so well. If I was in your position, maybe I'll be as angry. Thank you... ...for planning all this. Please, Sir, Ma'am. Sir, Ma'am. Please hold this diary. Galih. Please forgive me, Son. It was my fault, Mom. Bening. I'm sorry, Naya. If you run away again, you're gonna get it. I'll send you to an orphanage. Okay. I'm sorry too. Thank you. Hey! I was cleaning your room. Whose magazines are those? -Billy's. -Darto's. Those are mine. You and your reading materials. I don't want to see you reading those kind of magazines again. Alright. Let's have breakfast. Sure. Hey, where are you going, guys? What's the hurry? Don't let Naya find out that those magazines are from me, okay? I'll finish you! You too. That is some nice acting. No, I'm serious. I'll finish you. Seriously, I'll finish you. You too. Move, I wanna have breakfast. You got a job? Where? In an advertising agency, as a copywriter. I'm still writing though. But that story in your book, was that real story? So you wrote it together with that ghost? That's unbelievable. Hey, Jer, come here. -Here's the novel. -Thank you, Jeremy. Ghosts here are fun. You can ask them to write. You can't do that in my village. They're evil? They're illiterate. You know how village ghosts are. Right. Thank you, Jer. -Please excuse me. -Yeah. Here. It's a dummy so it's still rough, but you get the idea. "For Galih, thank you for your wonderful story." There they are. -How are you? -Ma'am. -Have you been waiting? -Not really. -Did you go on a trip? -No. What food have you brought us this time? Let's eat. This fishcake is so tasty. Where did you buy it? We bought these near Darto's school. We were on our way to pick up his high school uniform. You're a high-schooler already? I don't look like one, right? I have such a baby face. Which school? Adiguna, Ma'am. Adiguna is an expensive school. Luckily, this kid... ...managed to catch up with his lessons in the last minutes. So he got good grades and received a scholarship. I'm a smart kid. You must visit us often. We can live as a family. It feels like we have children again. That's right. So can I have some allowance? What was that? Don't worry. Give me the red ones, Sir. This one should do for such a baby face. You're not giving me the red ones? You said you're a smart kid. Color it yourself. You don't want it? -Can I have it? -Hey! You do want it. Since you consider us your own children, can you please give us a discount for the rent? You're the same. Sir? -It's a deal? -Okay, it can be arranged. You're so slick. "Ghost Writer"
