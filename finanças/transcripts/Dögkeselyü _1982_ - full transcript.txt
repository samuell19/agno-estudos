Yes, received We'll go get him He wasn't in the tunnel... Captain, I found something interesting... ...about a pickpocket operating in the 50s She apparently fleeced whole wedding parties And frequented all the big funerals The underworld called her Sympathy Mici - Shouldn't we look into the case? - Good idea Decide where to meet yet? What if the police were listening to us right now? I don't give a damn! Hold on Go to hell! Stay there! Police. Good morning - Jozsef Simon? - That's me We've searched all over for you I haven't done anything in my sleep, have I? We've just received your report from yesterday My boss wants to question you - When would you come? - Any time - Nine all right? - Fine Room 311 Hello, I'm here What if the police were listening? I don't give a damn Simply tell me where we meet so I can give you your dachshund You've got nerve Just answer my question You win, we didn't inform the police My mother and I kept wondering... if a friend were pulling our leg No one could be that vile Either you accept vileness and bring the money... ...or you stick to the crazy friend version and come without it... I'm ready for either I?ll bring the money Where do we meet? - You decide - 11 at the Gresham Where did the two women get out? At the Gaiety-Theatre Do you have any clue about where they live? I'd have put it in yesterday's report O.K., but they had to be talking about something Yes, funerals No names? Yes, Hanna Honthy What did they call each other? Nicknames? I don't remember Describe what they looked like? I didn't see the one right behind me The other was younger... ...and a bit taller I think It's my duty to warn you, Mr. Simon... ...that we are up against expert pickpockets... ...who specialize in large funerals... You are not the first case I have something here... Sympathy Mici's name was Maria Roska She left the country in 1956 Her sister, Erzsebet, still lives here Her present name is Mrs. Ivan Szanto And listen to this: she lives at Pozsonyi Street 17/b - What? - Just like I said A few streets away from where the ladies left the cab So you're the famous dogcatcher? It's only a sideline Do you know me from somewhere? Unfortunately not, but I'd be glad to... - Do you want anything? - No thank you Let's get to the point. Where's the dog? Leave that to me. Have you brought the money? It's lucky for you that money doesn't matter to us It's lucky for you We'd have been lucky if we'd never met you People who don't give a damn about money... Must be nice to spend life not caring about money I was never in a situation where money was unimportant It doesn't matter how much money someone has But you're loaded, right? Mind your own business! You'll get your money I'm a particular person. Let's take a brief count... The fur coat, sorry the fur is worth about 70 thousand Only 50? Maybe 80? The handbag 3 thousand, jewelry... And the shack you emerged from on Rose Hill? - How do you know where I live? - I sniffed around It's worth about 3 million, huh? Five, but that's none of your business I'm ashamed I don't know today's prices But I bet you don't either How much is a kilo of bread? Sugar, cheap sausage...? What are you trying to say? Let's stay with the math for a minute My monthly wages would cover your boots and handbag... But the jewelry and the clothes beneath the fur... Well... What horrible luck to have to deal with your sort Oh, how I pity you! My heart bleeds for you! Don't you know? What should I know? Your mother... ...likes to attend big funerals What of it? Don't you know? Honestly don't you know? I swear you're nuts Do I look like nuts? Excuse me for a second... - Mrs. Halmos? - Yes, who are you? I'll tell you, but it's your interest to listen Who's speaking? One of your victims... One of many you have robbed You don't know me. But I even know your dog So it's you? You'll get the money from my daughter God damn you! What more do you want? Where's Cecilia? The young lady and I are having coffee Let's discuss things, O. K.? - Let's get it over with. - Yes, you're right. How did you get on to me? No one's ever managed that before Even the best china breaks sometime What do you want? A hundred thousand! As soon as possible And what do you offer in exchange? - Your dog. - That's not much My silence, too, you dirty slut! In respect of whom? Your daughter and certain officials... ...who have a gnawing curiosity about you Look here, you small-time crook... I have no criminal record I've never had anything to do with the police You're welcome to set them onto me, you rat But they'll never find any proof against me Did you think you could scare me? You've come a cropper, my little man... And the dog? It can rot along with you! I see Oh no, you come with me I?ll follow you Don't take me for a fool - You're out of your mind. - Quite possibly Come on I?ll sit in the back You can sit on the roof for all I care Just let's get it over with Oh and I was hoping we could stay together a bit longer Let's go I?ll give you madam Just a moment We may be in trouble... I don't want to risk anything Don't call me till I get in touch with you again If you're questioned, you don't know me Use the old story. Put down the phone Is this the dog pound? Would you tell me? Is this where you hide the stolen dogs? You'll get your dog, I'll get the money, then you can get lost Are you crazy? Should I go back to town on foot? Go any way you like Is there something in my eye? Not there... We'll only take up a few minutes of your precious time... I?ll start in the middle It's about Cecilia Roska Who's she? Don't you know your sister's... Oh my God, yes, yes, that's the one... So you don't know your sister's daughter? It's the first I've ever heard of her As for my sister... I haven't seen her for 30 years Since the end of the 40s? Apparently she defected... in '54 or '55... We were never close... Imagine her having a child? What happened to the child? That's what we wanted to ask you And why me? Cecilia Roska has inherited a huge fortune in Canada My sister hasn't died, has she? We'd be happy to see this sizable sum here But, first, we have to find 25 year old Cecilia Roska Can't you find her? Not a trace. Checking on the name Roska... ...we discovered the hospital where she was born in 1956 But after her birth all trace was lost You don't have any idea where she might be? I'm truly shocked What's up? Jerome? Send a message to your mother, without mentioning whereabouts Tell her you are my prisoner and if she doesn't pay up I'll kill you Speak! No! Speak! Mama, give that man 500 thousand forints otherwise he'll kill me I can't say any more, I'm his prisoner Mama, pay what he asks Give him the money... whatever sum it is You lousy crook! ,,Mama, give that man 500 thousand forints...'' Cili, Cili, where are you? That was a recording. We can carry on with our chat My demands grown in proportion to the growing danger I now want one million If you get the police involved... ...I kill your daughter whether you pay or not If you have any illusions that I won't - forget them Police? Good morning Where's the boss? - I'm listening - Hello I?ll make you an offer Profitable I hope - What's this? - Read it - Here's the 3,000 - Give it to Peter Turkish Hill. Some sort of a resort area? That's right. Not far out of town - What's on the land? - A shack - What do you want with it? - I'm giving it to you What's the price? A bill of sale signed by you With the official seal and stamps - And for what sum? - 300 thousand I see it's gone up since yesterday Why don't you buy winning lottery tickets? They can cover you for several million I can easily fix that up for you Do you know the weekly winners? - I know good phone numbers. Peter! - Yes, boss - Have this repolished. - O.K. boss - It's no good. - Why not? I don't want to squander it The view's good but it's pretty bleak and windy A real vulture's nest. I don't want my son to inherit it So what's it about? That'll tell you everything I can also offer you a Lada Free, in return of a signed bill of sale That's not what we agreed on The situation's changed. The Lada's not a proposition for me You decide whether it is for you Here's the Mercedes Just a moment - Can I make a phone call? - Go ahead Renault outside the Gresham, dog in the car, car door locked All right Kowarski here, could I speak to my lawyer, please Do you have another car key? - Yes, in my coat pocket. - Then I suggest you come with us Is this it? - Is that the dog? - Yes No blood Looks as though its back was broken. The forensic people should come Rope off the area Who could it be? Try to think, madam... I never had any enemies That horrible cold voice, his style both suggest his baseness He called me... ...a dirty slut! That's part of the intimidation process too... We can't hate someone we don't know - Let me - Wait I want to pay the money Why did you do that? He'll kill my daughter Why did you do it? We have to detect the place he's speaking from We've learnt two things... He only waits for five rings, then he phones from somewhere else Second: he's obviously very smart Keep calm, he'll call again Pick it up after the fourth ring Keep him talking if you can I want to pay the money Agree to everything he asks... ...but try to help us, too Answer me, and don't try to play for time. Will you pay or not? Naturally... ...but isn't it a bit much? Enough! Is it yes or no? - Yes. - Good You did very well Phone-booth in Felszabadulas Square Two cars are going there I'm about to get the report. Nothing. He disappeared - The forensic people? - They left two minutes ago Listen Put the money in a bag Come to the parking lot outside Corvin at 13 hours... - ... then make for the underpass... - Which way should...? - I couldn't keep him. - Don't worry, we'll wait for the result Phone-booth in the Astoria underpass - How did he get there so quickly - I couldn't trail him There's such a crowd down there... And eight exits too... We've got two cars there So it's hopeless Watch in case he calls again - He knows what he's up to - True... Allow me to ask a question How did the culprit know you had so much money? From my daughter I suppose. He forced it out of her He's the type. Look what he did to Jerome I could tell from her voice We're up against a showman His aim is to intimidate you and get the money Trust us and do everything he asks you Where do you keep your money? In the bank We'll go there... When you finfish at the bank... I saw cops at the last place If I run across them again, it's your daughter's life If I'm caught she'll die where she is Pure bluff. Let's wait for the report Phone-booth at the East Station The guy's on the escalator by now. I give up Pessimist! You can have a cigarette He won't call for another hour The dog died two hours ago Its back was broken No fingerprints. We did find some earth though... ...by the driver's seat and on the pedals At last! I thought he'd never make a mistake Take it to the lab Compare the samples of earth... There was no earth on the dog's paws... Let's go. Do you have a suitable bag? Yes, my husband's attache case Fine. Do you have a looser coat? To conceal the case Bring the necessary papers, too - Is the Renault here? - Yes Will this be all right? - Yes I'm thirsty... A glass of water, please You're in luck Your mother's paying I have to pick up the money. I'll be back by 3.30 Stick it out till then - My hands hurt. - I know, but stick it out It's not your life at stake now, it's mine Why are you here? Not to give me water I imagine You're here for two reasons: I want your mother to pay... ...before I expose her to the police as a pickpocket And I'd like to teach you a lesson I'd like you to understand what an enormous sum 10,000 forints is That's what your mother stole from me, though you don't believe it No, I don't Where do you think your money comes from? My father was rich. He earned a lot As a lawyer? He specialized in apartments Is it a sin to earn a lot of money? Apartments... When did your father die? Two years ago And the family tomb goes on coughing up the money! Or do these deals pay interest underground, too? I'm punishing you... ...because you robbed me Your mother robbed me of my last forint And I'm not the only one And I will punish her any way I can Take a look around. I live in a place like this I inherited this. And maybe my son will inherit it, too People who live as I do... You wouldn't understand... Do you know how many invisible hands there are in this city? Hands that delve into pockets and draw out the hard-earned forints? I have to go. Some practical advice: If I'm not here before dark... Why shouldn't you be? Then start chewing the rope What nonsense! I'm not a murderer The gas will last a day or two If you stay, cold or hunger will kill you... It's a strong rope But with a strong will you could get through it by evening This is just a last resort I'm bound to be back before five You work everything out in advance? Only since I've been living like this I'm doing something all the way for once Know what that means? Why should you? Goodbye Go down to the Emke metro station Keep watch You'll get further instructions by radio I?ll be covering the square Should anyone call Mrs. Halmos, or take the case from her... ...get on their trail and signal through the walkie-talkie You stick to Mrs. Halmos. Don't lose sight of her And if we lose her? Just don't Here she is Yes, she's arrived Evening News! For how long? - Two hours - Five forints, please We're looking after you... Thank you ,,Go down to the metro. Go off towards Orsvezer Square... Get out at Pillango Street... '' - ...I'd climb on top of you... - You can't don't you see? - We'll push it all the way - With that? Don't do that... - I've got two hundred for you. - Whisper in my ear My mom's being followed by her ex-husband. They shouldn't meet They're going to come down these steps What does he look like?
