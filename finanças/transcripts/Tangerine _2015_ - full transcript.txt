She's getting skinnier and skinnier. Everyone comes to America and gets fat. Even I gained weight. But this girl gets skinnier. I don't gain or lose. You always weigh the same. Mom, I'm sorry. I spilled a little bit. Where are the fruits? Fruits. Coming right up. She loves that dog. She loves that dog very much. I don't like dogs. Maybe I'll get used to it. Everything requires getting used to. You'll get used to a lot more than that. Again you want to smoke? Eat something. Please help yourself. How are you, Razmik? Good. How are you? Good. Thank God. How is Ashot? Good. He's growing old... With me. Any business out there today? Let her grow up a little and then Yeva can start working also. Well, I came here to help with the child so they can work. That's the right thing to do. That's what grandmothers are for. So they can help take care of my sweetie pie. Ashken, she looks like you. No, she looks more like Razmik. Especially her smile. Come here, sweetie. Come and sit with Daddy. Merry Christmas. Good to see you. Come here, baby. Has she eaten? She doesn't eat this kind of food. I will feed her later. Let's toast to the head of this household. All the best to you and your family. Thank you. Wishing you the same. To your health. Ashken, you have a great son-in-law. He's great but he gets tired too much. I'm going to go to work. Now? Yes, I didn't earn a penny today. But we're eating. - So what? - It's Christmas Eve. So what? I have no patience for her. Make sure she doesn't make a fuss. I'll take care of it. Forgive me, but I have to go to work. What do you mean you have to leave? You just got home. I haven't made a penny today. I'm going to work for a few hours. It's Christmas and I have guests. It's okay, Mom. It's okay. You don't have to make money today. It's Christmas. What do you mean? If I don't make money, how do we live? - It's okay, Mom. - It's Christmas Eve. Christmas is for Americans. For us, it's another work day. You live in America now. What did he say? Yeva, what did he say? He said he must go. He speaks English but he doesn't celebrate Christmas. He should have stayed home tonight. I know but his real Christmas is on the 6th. Today isn't his real Christmas. He was the only man at the table. He was pouring us cognac. Now we have to pour it ourselves. Mom, he's the only one working and supporting this household. Let's not let this ruin our night. Mother, I'm not discussing this. I'm your mother. If I don't talk about it, who will? Mother, stop. I'm not cleaning up. I'm going to bed. Are you Armenian? Yeah. - What's your name, son? - Karo. Karo, do you know Razmik? Which Razmik? Razmik Simonian. He is one of your drivers. Yes. Of course. I know him very well. I need you to take me to him right away. Please. Where do you think he might be? I am his mother-in-law. Oh. He should be around the West Hollywood area. I will find him for you. Razmik? Razmik? Where is your location? Razmik is not working tonight. I knew it. I told her he is not going to work. What is the matter, Auntie? How well do you know my son-in-law? Mom? We will find him but we may drive all night. Okay? Yes, drive. It's okay. This weather in LA doesn't help to set the holiday mood. There's no Christmas without snow. Christmas is Christmas regardless of the weather. Feels fake. Los Angeles is a beautifully wrapped lie. I'm learning English. Auntie, are you sure you want to keep looking? What was your name again? Karo. Karo, please don't waste my time. Take me to Razmik. Okay, I will take you to your son-in-law. But do you know why? Because he has to understand that even if he does not respect himself... ...he must respect his family. Shit floats to the surface. Have you ever been to Santa Monica and Highland? Oh, I don't remember. You will remember. He's lucky he's in America. Imagine if he was in Armenia. There's his cab. Should I stop here? Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop right here. You know what? It's okay. I don't need money. Happy New Year. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? - I don't understand. - You said you were going to work. I am at work. I'm getting coffee. Did Yeva bring you here? Is she here? No, Yeva did not. Karo brought me here. I'm not going anywhere until I get an explanation. Who are these people? These are just regular people. Come on, let's go home. I said I'm not going to go anywhere. Oh, I see... you are smoking marijuana with these people. Oh, my God, what are you talking about? Ashken, let me explain. Oh, my God... these are men. Oh, my God... these are men. Oh, dear Lord, my heart is going to stop. I'm going to have a heart attack. Yeva, come to the corner of Santa Monica and Highland. Donut shop. Your husband is with gay prostitutes. Corner of Santa Monica and Highland. Done! Done! Ashken, listen to me. Let's go home. Don't touch me. What do you mean "don't touch me"? Why did you come here? - C'mon, get up. - Don't touch me. You are embarrassing me. No, you are embarrassing us. C'mon, get up. What do you want from us? Don't you feel sorry for my daughter? She's going to call the police. In front of all these people, I'm going to rip your mask off. Listen to me. Get up. Let's go. I'm going to find out what you are doing here. Razmik? Are you people totally insane? Why did you bring the baby here? Mom, what's going on here? Your husband is a dog. Dog. Mom, what's going on with you? You think I don't know? I check your bank statements... Every night he withdraws cash from your account... What does he spend it on? Them. This is embarrassing. Please. Let's go home. Mom, why are you getting involved in my family's affairs? It's none of your business. You can pretend to be blind but I cannot. Get up. We're going home. I'm not going to allow him to get away with this. What is the prostitute saying to you? He comes home every night smelling like cheap perfume and you don't say anything. I know my husband well enough. Come on, let's go. You think you know him? You are blind. What is the prostitute saying to you? Razmik supports the family. He takes care of us. What are you talking about? He only takes care of himself. I'm going home. Mom, what do you want to do, destroy my family? I'm going to rip his mask off. Sometimes a wife has to turn a blind eye. No! No! Get down. No wonder she's crying having a father like that. Mother, please. Subtitles for KT
