PREVIOUSLY ON "PARIS HILTON'S BFF DUBAI"... FAME OVER HERE, FORTUNE OVER HERE. WHICH ONE DO YOU CHOOSE? - HEALTH. - THAT WASN'T AN OPTION. A HUNGRY TIGER IS SOMEONE WHO CAME HERE TO GET FAMOUS. I WILL NOT TAKE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS NOT ME. I DON'T FIGHT WITH ANYONE, BUT BECAUSE I AM A MODEL THEY... IT IS NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MODEL! BRANKA IS A MODEL! EVERYBODY HAS DONE MODELING! YOU TALK ABOUT IT 24-7. I HATE HER. I LOATHE HER. FARHANA, I WOULD SLAP THE... OUT OF YOU IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE THIS DOOR. IS SHE GONNA BEHAVE LIKE THIS WITH PARIS? BUT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF, AND IT WON'T BE FARHANA. FARHANA, SORRY, I GOT THE LAST WORD. FOOL. * ALL OF MY LIFE * DON'T YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WAITING? * * For the best friend. * COULD YOU BE THE ONE I WANT? * * My best friend. THE ELIMINATION WAS TOUGH, BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE A NEW LITTLE STAR. GELAREH, YOU'RE MY LITTLE STAR, BUT I CAN'T DECIDE WHO MY NEXT ONE WILL BE. SO I'M GONNA LET YOU DECIDE. I PICK BRANKA. I LOVE IT. SHE'S HUNGRY FOR THE STAR NECKLACE. I AM. I WAS HUNGRY. LOVES IT. LET'S SEE. CHEER UP. - MIDGET. - GIANT. THERE YOU GO. COME. - YOU DO? - SHUT UP. SO TOMORROW I HAVE A LITTLE TREAT FOR YOU ALL. YOU'RE ALL COMING WITH ME TO THE EMIRATES PALACE IN ABU DHABI FOR A FUN PARTY I'M HOSTING. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. I'LL SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW. BYE. - GET SOME REST. THE BFFs AND I HAD SO MUCH FUN IN DUBAI, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE NEW. I HOPE THEY LIKE YACHT RIDES. EMIRATES PALACE! HI, THERE! MY BFF NEEDS TO GET THE ATTENTION OF A ROOM AND SPEAK ELOQUENTLY. WHAT BETTER THAN WRITING A TOAST FOR A CHALLENGE? ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES WAS WE HAVE TO WRITE A TOAST FOR PARIS THAT EVENING. SOME OF THE GIRLS GOT REALLY CREATIVE AND SOME OF THE GIRLS DIDN'T HAVE ONE BRAIN CELL OF CREATIVITY IN THEIR HEAD. NOW THE COMPETITION IS VERY HARDER, SO I NEED TO IMPRESS MORE PARIS. BUT I WILL TRY TO IMPRESS HER WITH MY PERSONALITY BECAUSE I WILL NOT TRY TO BE SOMEBODY WHO I'M NOT, TO MAKE SOME BIG THINGS. I WILL TRY TO IMPRESS HER WITH ME, MYSELF AND I. I THINK, ACTUALLY, IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TELL PARIS WHAT I WANT TO TELL HER AND HOW HAPPY I AM. SO I'M GONNA DO THAT. DON'T READ IT. EMBARRASSING. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO PUT IN MY TOAST. I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT IT. THERE ARE THE OBVIOUS THINGS TO SAY, BUT THAT'S JUST GONNA BE BORING. I MEAN, ANY OPPORTUNITY, ESPECIALLY LIKE THIS, IS USEFUL TO HELP IMPRESS PARIS, SO I NEED TO REALLY THINK OF SOMETHING SMART TO SAY. YOU KNOW, A CHEERS OR A TOAST IS ALWAYS SOMETHING SWEET. IT SHOULD BE SHORT AND TO THE POINT. IT SHOULD MAKE YOUR HEART FEEL A LITTLE SOMETHING, YOU KNOW. I FINISHED MY SPEECH ALREADY. TO WRITE THE SPEECH, I HAD TO THINK A LOT 'CAUSE I WANTED TO USE SPECIAL WORDS FOR A SPECIAL PERSON LIKE PARIS. MY TOAST IS GOING TO BE THE BEST. I'M SO USED TO JUST FREE-STYLING AND JUST WHATEVER COMES OUT COMES OUT. I'M NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON TO SIT THERE AND TRY TO PLAN WHAT I'M GONNA SAY. SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY, 'CAUSE MY BRAIN IS FROZEN AND I'M EXHAUSTED. I'M REALLY TIRED. I WOULD LOVE TO SAY THE BEST THINGS TO HER RIGHT NOW, BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY IN ME RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT. EMIRATES PALACE! SO BEAUTIFUL. WHOO-HOO! I LOVE THE HEAT! I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SPENDING A DAY IN ABU DHABI AND GOING TO THE EMIRATES PALACE. AMIGO. ALL RIGHT. - IT'S ORANGE. - WE LOVE ORANGE. WOW, LOOK AT THE BED. IS THIS FOR ME? WHATEVER. THE BATHROOM IS NICER THAN THE BEDROOM. THE EMIRATES PALACE IS JUST STUNNING. IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, LIVING IN THE U.A.E. * I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY LONGER. * COME ON, YOU GUYS. NO. GOOD NIGHT, GIRLS. GOOD NIGHT, BRAN. LOOKS LIKE A SNOOP DOGG VIDEO. THE HOTEL WAS AMAZING. IT WAS LIKE AN ACTUAL PALACE. WE WENT TO THE BEST SUITE IN THERE. IT WAS, I THINK, THE BIGGEST. SO WE RELAXED FOR A BIT. I THINK PARIS STAYS IN NICE HOTELS LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME. OF COURSE. I BET YOU HER BEDROOM LOOKS LIKE THIS, BUT PINK. - BUT I THINK THAT SHE'S LONELY... - NOT THIS COLOR. NO, I SAID IT LOOKS LIKE THIS BUT PINK. - PINK, YEAH. - REALLY? AND WE ALL HAD TO GET READY THERE BECAUSE WE WERE GONNA MEET PARIS AND SIT DOWN WITH HER AND GIVE A TOAST. WHAT I NEED TO DO IS GET A NEW DRESS, IS WHAT I NEED TO DO. MY BOOBS LOOK FAT. FAT BOOBS. YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S NOT THAT BAD, LIKE IS THIS. * FOR THAT ONE SPECIAL KISS * * OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE. HOW ABOUT THIS? HOW ABOUT THIS HERE? BEAUTIFUL, BABY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THOSE? - YEAH, IT'S COOL. - REALLY? BUT YOU NEED PINS. I HAD TO ACTUALLY THINK A LOT 'CAUSE WHEN YOU SAY A TOAST, YOU HAVE TO SAY IT WITH MEANING AND LOVE. OH WHY WHY, DANA? I'M FEELING STUCK. - COMING UP... - YOU HAVE PREPARED A TOAST FOR PARIS. WOW, THAT'S A SHORT DRESS. NOT TO BE RUDE, YOU HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THIS GIRL RIGHT HERE. - AND LATER... - THE GIRL NEEDED TO PARTY. THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS JUMP ON THE COUCH BESIDE PARIS. MANDY WAS ALL OVER PARIS LIKE SWINE FLU. THE EMIRATES PALACE WAS CRAZY HUGE AND BEAUTIFUL. THE GIRLS THOUGHT THEY WERE WRITING A TOAST FOR ME, BUT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW, I HAD A SURPRISE OF MY OWN: MY MOM. HI, GIRLS. - Girls: HI. HI. HI, I'M PARIS'S MOM KATHY. HI, HOW ARE YOU? WE ALL GOT INTO THE DINNER ROOM WITH OUR SPEECHES AND WE WERE EXPECTING, OF COURSE, PARIS TO BE THERE, BUT WE WEREN'T EXPECTING KATHY, HER MOTHER, TO BE THERE. I THINK WE ALL GOT A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. - I LOVE YOUR NECKLACE. - THANK YOU. LADIES, NAPKINS ON THE LAPS. SORRY. SO EVERYONE, THIS IS MY MOTHER KATHY. - HI, KATHY. - NICE TO MEET YOU. AND I TRUST HER OPINION MORE THAN ANYONE'S, - SO I WANT HER TO MEET EVERYONE. - YEAH. FOR PARIS, GIVING US THE CHANCE TO BE INTRODUCED TO MRS. HILTON, I REALLY RESPECT THAT AND I DID LOVE HER MOTHER SO MUCH. WELL, YOU'RE ALL BEAUTIFUL LADIES, AND I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU. AT NIGHT, I'VE BEEN KEEPING THIS ONE UP LATE, AND SHE'S BEEN SHOWING ME ON THE COMPUTER, AND TELLING ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH ONE OF YOU. WHAT I AM NOT SEEING HERE AT ALL IS HOW THERE ARE SEVEN OF YOU LEFT. ISN'T THERE ANY, LIKE, CATFIGHTS GOING ON, - ANYTHING? 'CAUSE SHE'S... - NOT TODAY, ACTUALLY. - BUT HAVE YOU AT ALL? - YES. CAN I JUST ASK ONE QUESTION? WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE ONE TO MAKE A DECISION RIGHT NOW IF I WAS TO ASK A QUESTION? OKAY. WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST OPERATOR HERE? I AM. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. WHO'S THE SECOND BIGGEST OPERATOR? OKAY. DINA'S MORE VERBAL, BUT SHE MANIPULATES WITH HER EYES. OH WAIT, OKAY, THEN... ONE SECOND. WHO'S THE BIGGEST MANIPULATOR IN THE GROUP? ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S A MANIPULATOR IN THIS GROUP. OH, THAT'S BORING. - WHAT? - THE MANIPULATORS ARE GONE. OH, YOU DID? I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE PREPARED A TOAST FOR PARIS. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST? BRANKA. ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE, SO I WILL SAY SOMETHING ON MY CROATIAN LANGUAGE. WHICH MEANS, "I HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY DUBAI AND THAT YOU WOULD COME BACK AGAIN. I LOVE YOU." - THANK YOU. - THAT'S VERY SWEET. - IT'S VERY NICE. - VERY NICE. ZIVJELI, PARIS. ZIVJELI, IT MEANS "CHEERS" IN MY CROATIAN LANGUAGE. - ZIVJELI. - ZIVJELI, MOM AND PARIS. WHEN I STOOD UP TO GIVE A TOAST TO PARIS AND HER MOM, I WAS SO NERVOUS. I HATE WRITING WITH A PASSION, BUT I HATE PRESENTING ANYTHING BADLY, SO I TRIED. "AS-SALAMU ALAYKUM, PRINCESS P. YOU ONCE MET A GIRL WHO WAS ME. YOU CAME TO DUBAI, IN A GAME YOU WOULD TRY TO FIND A BEST FRIEND FOR KEEPS. I CAME TO IMPRESS, BUT I FEEL I MUST STRESS THAT WHAT I AM IS GENUINELY WHAT YOU SEE. IN THE PENTHOUSE WE'VE BEEN LIVING, YOU HAVE BEEN SO VERY GIVING, IN EXCHANGE FOR A TRUST THAT IS PRICELESS. YOU ARE SO VERY SWEET, ALWAYS HAVE THE MOST AMAZING SHOES ON YOUR FEET. WE SHARED HUMMUS TOGETHER. I HOPE WE'LL STAY FRIENDS FOREVER. NOW I'LL STOP RIGHT HERE. LET'S TOAST TO THIS WONDERFUL HOST. FOR PARIS, LET'S GIVE A BIG CHEER." - THANK YOU. - THAT WAS AMAZING. I LIKED THAT. "AS WE GATHER HERE TOGETHER AND SHARE THESE LOVELY MOMENTS HERE WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU, PARIS, FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF YOUR WORLD HERE IN DUBAI AND THE CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW YOU. EVERY DAY IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE. AND IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES, FUN TIMES AS WELL AS SAD TIMES. GETTING TO KNOW YOU, AND SEEING HOW SWEET AND SUCH A STRONG, GENUINE WOMAN YOU ARE MADE IT ALL WORTHWHILE. IT REALLY DID. HOPEFULLY, YOU WILL REALIZE, AND GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO SHOW YOU HOW MY EXPERIENCES IN LIFE MADE ME A GRATEFUL, TRUSTWORTHY, HUMBLE AND MOST IMPORTANT, STRONG WOMAN. AND THAT'S WHAT A FRIEND NEEDS, SOMEONE WHO CAN BE STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT YOU IN LIFE." - THAT'S IT, THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. DINA... HER TOAST WAS LIKE WE WERE AT A WEDDING. SHE WAS LIKE, "DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY..." LIKE... "DEAR PARIS'S FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND THE PRINCESS HERSELF PARIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GRACING US WITH YOUR PRESENCE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. WE'RE SO BLESSED TO BE HERE IN HEALTH, WHICH WE ONLY HAVE GOD TO THANK. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, WE'VE GOT TO KNOW PARIS AS THE INTELLIGENT, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT SHE IS, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO WE CAN THANK FOR THAT." WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE'S TWO. TWO. HE'S NOT HERE. NO, IT'S ALWAYS THE WOMAN. WE DO EVERYTHING. GOOD EVENING, PARIS AND KATHY. "PARIS, I'M PLEASED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MEET YOU AND ESPECIALLY TO BE A FRIEND OF YOURS FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD. I BELIEVE LIFE HAS NO MEANING WITHOUT FRIENDSHIPS." I'M SORRY, CAN I REPEAT THAT? - OKAY. - SURE. - I READ VERY FAST SO... - Kathy: YOU'RE DOING GREAT. CAN I REPEAT AGAIN? OKAY. OKAY. "I BELIEVE LIFE HAS NO MEANING IF FRIENDSHIPS DON'T EXIST. CHEERS, PARIS." - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. IT WAS VERY SINCERE. I'M NEXT. WOW, THAT'S A SHORT DRESS. OOH, MRS. HORNBALL. GOOD EVENING, MISS HILTON. MRS. HILTON. - MRS. HILTON. - SORRY. SORRY, MRS. HILTON, PARIS, GIRLS. IT'S A LITTLE POEM FOR YOU GUYS AND MISS PARIS. "A FRIEND IS A FRIEND WHO IS ALWAYS THERE. NO MATTER WHAT, SHE'LL ALWAYS SHARE, IN HAPPINESS AND IN SADNESS, IN BUSY TIMES AND LONELY TIMES. EVEN WHEN YOUR EYES ARE FULL OF TEARS OR YOUR HEART IS FULL OF FEARS, WHO WOULD REACH TO YOUR... TO HOLD YOUR HAND WHEN SHE SEES YOU SQUEEZING YOUR FINGERS WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS OR EVEN... OR EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE CHEWING GUM STUCK IN YOUR HAIR OR GOT DIRTY BY THE LITTLE BIRD FLYING BY YOUR SHOULDER. A YEAR AGO, I HAVE THAT FRIEND WHOM I BELIEVED IN AND TRUSTED. BUT THAT FRIEND SADLY DISAPPOINTED ME AND PUT ME DOWN. SHE BROKE MY HEART AND MADE ME CRY. TODAY, I STAND HERE WITH MY HEAD HELD UP HIGH, FIGHTING AND STRONGLY COMPETING TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I'M BETTER THAN THAT FRIEND." - AW. - THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MANDY'S WAS KIND OF CONFUSING. IT STARTED OFF AS A POEM AND THEN BECAME LIKE, HER LIFE STORY ABOUT HOW HER BOYFRIEND CHEATED ON HER, WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A TOAST. GOOD EVENING, PARIS, KATHY, FELLOW BFFs. "I'M SO HAPPY THAT I GOT THE CHANCE TO MEET YOU AND TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU. IT MADE ME REMEMBER WHAT I'M MISSING AWAY FROM MY FRIENDS... SLEEPOVERS, LUNCH DATES, SHOPPING, GIRL TALK. BUT LIFE WORKS IN FUNNY WAYS, AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING TO GAIN SOMETHING, AND I THINK I'VE GAINED YOU. SO CHEERS TO GOOD FRIENDS, GOOD HEALTH AND GOOD FUN." - CHEERS. - REALLY NICE. - THANK YOU. - CHEERS. AFTER HEARING EVERYONE ELSE'S, I THOUGHT MINE DEFINITELY STOOD OUT. QUITE CHALLENGING TO MAKE SOMETHING FUN, MEANINGFUL, PERSONAL AND GETTING A STRONG MESSAGE ACROSS, BUT I LIKE CHALLENGES, AND I WAS REALLY PROUD OF THE END RESULT. I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE MEETING ALL OF YOU. - THANK YOU. - A PLEASURE. SO TONIGHT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF FUN. I'M TAKING YOU ALL DOWN TO THE NIGHTCLUB. IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU ALL AND GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. - OKAY. THE TOASTS WERE ALL VERY SWEET. THEY SAID A LOT ABOUT THE BFFs' PERSONALITIES. I WAS REALLY GLAD MY MOM WAS THERE TO MEET THEM. AFTER THE TOASTS WERE DONE AND EVERYBODY LEFT TO GET READY FOR THE CLUB, I DECIDED TO ASK MY MOM WHAT SHE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE BFFs. SHE ALWAYS GIVES ME THE BEST ADVICE. SO WHAT DID YOU THINK? THIS IS THE EASIEST OF ALL. I REALLY... I THINK THEY ARE IN THIS BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO WANT TO MEET YOU. I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF THESE GIRLS, IT'S ABOUT WANTING TO BE FAMOUS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I REALLY THINK THAT THEY'RE IN FOR THE EXPERIENCE AND TO GET TO KNOW YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK, OUT OF EVERYONE, DID THE WORST? LIKE, MADE THE WORST IMPRESSION? NOT TO BE RUDE, YOU HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THIS GIRL RIGHT HERE. - BRANKA. - NOT AT ALL. NOT A CHANCE. BRANKA MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ME THAT... YOU WERE WEIRDED OUT? IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, EXACTLY. AND MRS. HORNBALL, MANDY, IT SOUNDED LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHE SHOULD BE AT THE CHURCH, THAT IT WAS A WEDDING CEREMONY. AND AMY, SWEET BUT... I MEAN, I THINK THAT YOU'D BE BORED. - THIS ONE HERE, I AM CRAZY ABOUT. - DANA. I WOULD ADOPT HER. I LOVE HER, I LOVE HER. I THINK SHE'S SWEET. I THOUGHT THAT HER POEM... I THINK SHE'S... I THINK SHE'S ORGANIC. SO, MOM, I KNOW YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME GREAT ADVICE ON MY FRIENDS. - THEN LISTEN TO ME. - I WILL. WHO DO YOU THINK WOULDN'T BE A GOOD FIT FOR ME? JUST THE FIT, I JUST DON'T SEE... I WOULD SAY BRANKA OR MANDY. - WHY? - I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH EITHER ONE OF THEM. NOTHING BAD, JUST... WHAT ABOUT THE VIBE YOU GOT? THERE WAS NO ENERGY THERE AT ALL. THIS IS A GOOD ONE. - DANA. - I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FUN WITH HER. I THINK SHE'S SINCERE AND I THINK SHE WROTE THAT HERSELF. PARTY TIME. WHOO-HOO-HOO. OKAY, HELP ME, PLEASE? MOM ALWAYS KNOWS BEST, AND SHE REALLY GAVE ME A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. LET'S GO. LET'S GO TO THE... HIGH FIVE! LET'S GO. LET'S GO TO BAR. ON THE SIDE. THAT SIDE. LET'S DO A PRAYER, EVERYONE. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR THE PAST FREAKING WEEK. AND IT IS MY DREAM COME TRUE. RIGHT NOW, I'M READY TO PARTY. I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING TO THE PARTY WITH PARIS. PARTYING WITH PARIS MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A STAR. MANDY, SHE NEEDED TO GET THE PARTY OUT. LIKE, THIS GIRL NEEDED TO PARTY. THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS JUMP ON THE COUCH BESIDE PARIS. I... I STOOD BACK. SOME OF THE GIRLS LOST CONTROL. THEY WERE TALKING TO HER TOO MUCH AND YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS GETTING ANNOYED. SHE JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN AND DANCE. IT WASN'T LIKE SHE WAS HAVING A MEETING. MANDY WAS ALL OVER PARIS. LIKE SWINE FLU. I NEVER SAW A GIRL SO DESPERATE TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT. WHEN I SAW THAT... WHEN WE WERE CLUBBING WITH PARIS AND HER PARENTS, I WAS MAKING SURE THEY WERE ALL RIGHT, COMFORTABLE, GETTING DRINKS AND NOT BEING BOTHERED. SO I THINK THAT MADE ME STAND OUT. A LOT OF THE GIRLS WERE ACTING LIKE WAITRESSES. LIKE, "WHAT CAN I GET YOU? COULD I BRING YOU A DRINK? LET ME GET YOU THIS. LET ME GET YOU THAT." THAT'S NICE, BUT IT WAS BECOMING A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH. MANDY AND DINA WOULD TRY WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN THIS COMPETITION, TO FORCE THEIR WAY THERE. SO IF THAT MEANS SUCKING UP TO PARIS'S PARENTS AND HER FRIENDS AND EVERYTHING... WHEN IT'S TIME TO PARTY, I THINK YOU SHOULD REALLY PARTY. IN THE CLUB WITH PARIS AND HER PARENTS, I THINK WE MADE A BLAST. THE CLUB WAS A LOT OF FUN, BUT I'M STILL NOT SURE ABOUT SOME OF THE BFFs. I'VE GOT A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. I FOUND OUT NEITHER DANA NOR BRANKA CAN DRIVE AND MY NEW BFF HAS TO KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. SO I SENT THEM BOTH TO DRIVING SCHOOL. - HI. - HI, HOW ARE YOU? I'M ALL RIGHT. DANA. I'M LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE. I JUST STARTED LEARNING IN DUBAI. - FOOT BRAKE. - OKAY. YEAH, SHIFT "D." STRAIGHT. - - NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM. HIT THE BRAKE. LEFT SIDE. TURN LEFT SIDE. SHOW THIS WOMAN A BETTER DRIVER. YES, COME ON. WE CAN DO THIS. I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, PARIS. PULL THE HANDBRAKE UP. STEP ON THE GAS, BABY. SLOW. - - DO YOU LOVE IT? - YUP. THAT'S HOT. WOULD YOU GIVE ME A DRIVING LICENSE? YEAH, DEFINITELY. YOU WOULD PASS ME? WOULD YOU PASS ME? - YEAH, YOU ARE... - Branka: OF COURSE, BABY, YOU ARE GREAT. - YAY. - AWESOME. DO YOU THINK I COULD DRIVE PARIS AROUND? I DON'T THINK SO. SEE, I LEARNED. THANK YOU. - SEE? I'M SO GOOD. - VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD. IT WAS FUN. IT WAS... HE SAYS HE'LL GIVE ME A LICENSE. SO THAT'S GREAT. IT SOLVES MY PROBLEM. I'M A LITTLE BIT AFRAID, BUT I'M HAPPY TO LEARN. OH. I DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE. I PASSED IT BEFORE FOUR YEARS. AND TILL THEN, I DIDN'T DRIVE, SO... - AND THIS IS THE BRAKE. - AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE BRAKE. SO I'M BRAKING. ALL RIGHT. SORRY. DON'T DO IT ON THE ROAD. SORRY. UH, RIGHT. SORRY. I HAVE A BIT OF PROBLEM... HI. IT WAS AMAZING. I DON'T AFRAID ANYMORE TO DRIVE. YOU NEARLY KILLED US. - NO. GAVE ME WHIPLASH. - WHEN. - MAYBE. - WHEN YOU BRAKED REALLY... MAYBE. I FORGOT, MAYBE. - LAMBORGHINI? - YAY! - WHOO. - HEY, GIRLS. HI. I LOVE FAST CARS, AND THESE TOYS ARE NOT JUST FOR BOYS. SO TODAY, I'M GONNA SEE IF YOU BOTH CAN HANDLE THIS HOT RIDE. - WOW, THANK YOU. - YAY. AND THIS IS A TREAT JUST FOR YOU TWO. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO HAVE FUN. AMAZING. BEAUTIFUL CAR. I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DRIVING LICENSE, AND I'M GETTING TO DRIVE THIS LAMBORGHINI. I'M AFRAID. THIS IS TOO STRONG CAR. BYE. I WANT TO HAVE THIS CAR. - - WHOO! MAMA MIA. IT WAS AMAZING. OOH. IT WAS AMAZING. I LOVE THIS CAR. BYE. I'M SO EXCITED. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE LETTING ME DO THIS. HAVE YOU DRIVEN A SPORTS CAR BEFORE? NO, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A DRIVING LICENSE. YOU'RE KIDDING. THE FIRST RULE IS YOU GOTTA WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT. OKAY OKAY, FINE. I RECOMMEND YOU DO TOO. YEAH, WHOO-HOO! I MEAN IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU, BUT I THINK IT LOOKS BETTER ON ME. WHOO! LOVES IT! THANK YOU, PARIS! - COMING UP... - AND WHO BETTER TO TELL ME HOW GOOD A BFF YOU WOULD BE THAN ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS? A SIGN THAT DANA'S A GOOD FRIEND IS THE FACT THAT I'M HERE NOW. FINALLY, A GUY IS IN THE PENTHOUSE. THEY WANTED TO ATTACK HIM. - AND LATER... - I'M SORRY. THE THREE WHO MUST PACK AND LEAVE NOW ARE... I HAD A SPECIAL TREAT FOR THE BFFs TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO MEET SOME VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE. I CAN'T WAIT. HEY. - HI. HI. NICE DRESS. SO I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE OF YOU WOULD MAKE A GOOD FRIEND FOR ME, AND WHO BETTER TO TELL ME HOW GOOD A BFF YOU WOULD BE THAN ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS? I'VE ASKED YOUR FRIENDS TO COME ALONG TO THE BFF PENTHOUSE TO TELL ME HOW GOOD A BFF YOU WOULD MAKE FOR ME. OH! YOU ARE ALL WEARING NICE DRESSES. - MWAH, MWAH, MWAH. - HOW ARE YOU, BABY? TELL ME WHY BRANKA WOULD MAKE A GOOD BFF FOR ME. I THINK BRANKA IS A VERY STRONG PERSONALITY, AND SHE IS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE GIRLS. FROM THE WAY SHE SPEAK AND WHAT SHE SPEAK... - IS CRAZY. - NO. AND IT MAKES HER UNIQUE. AND I THINK SHE IS REALLY FUNNY AND YOU WILL NEVER BE BORED WITH BRANKA. SO IF YOU HAVE SAD MOMENTS, YOU HAVE TO CALL BRANKA AND SHE WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY. SHE MAKES YOU LAUGH. AND SHE'S NOT A HUNGRY TIGER BECAUSE YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES GIRLS WHO ARE AROUND YOU, THEY WANT FAME OR THEY ARE NOT HONEST. AND I THINK BRANKA IS NOT LOOKING FOR THESE. I THINK SHE'S VERY OPEN. - AND HONEST. - YEAH. OKAY, AND HONEST. BABY, I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. BRANKA AND HER BFF COULD BE TWINS. NEXT UP IS GELAREH'S FRIEND, MACY. SO TELL ME WHY GELAREH WOULD MAKE A GOOD FRIEND FOR ME. OKAY, GELAREH IS A PERSON THAT TOOK ME A LIFETIME TO GET TO KNOW. AND YOU SHOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE HER HERE TODAY. SHE'S A PERSON THAT'S VERY DETERMINED. SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS. SHE DOES NOT TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER. SHE'S A SWEETHEART DEEP DOWN INSIDE. SHE HAS AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM, BUT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HER, SHE'S SWEET. HMM, AN ATTITUDE. THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM. HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR COMING. SO TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER. SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT AMY. I THINK THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME WE WENT OUT, WE WERE AT A PARTY. CLASSIC. AND THEY STARTED TO INTERVIEW AMY ON CAMERA. AND AMY JUST TOOK OVER THE SHOW, LITERALLY. TOOK THE MIKE FROM THE MAN AND JUST STARTED GOING AROUND THE ENTIRE PARTY, INTERVIEWING OTHER PEOPLE. AND IT WAS AMAZING. SHE WAS GREAT. BUT NOT IN A HUNGRY TIGER KIND OF WAY. SHE HAS TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION? SOMEONE SOUNDS LIKE A DIVA. SO TELL ME WHY DINA WOULD MAKE A GREAT FRIEND? DINA IS MY FRIEND SINCE LONG TIME. I LOVE MY FRIEND. SHE'S A SISTER MORE THAN A FRIEND. AND I'M SURE WHEN YOU KNOW HER MORE, YOU WILL JUST LOVE HER AS I DO. AND SHE'S CLASSY. AW, HOW SWEET. PARIS, THIS IS DONNA. HI, NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. FINALLY. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. HI, HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S UP? SO TELL ME WHY MANDY WOULD MAKE A GOOD FRIEND. IS IT OKAY IF I JUST READ SOME STUFF WHAT I WROTE? 'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT HER. OKAY, SHE IS THE ONE PERSON WHO WILL BE THERE FOR YOU WHEN NO ONE IS THERE. OUT OF ALL THE FRIENDS, SHE IS THE ONE. WHAT'S HER WORST QUALITY? YEAH, I GOT THAT TOO. UM... AND SHE... IT MIGHT NOT BE BAD, BUT IT GETS ANNOYING AT TIMES, SHE LOVES TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. WHEN PARIS ASKED HER "WHAT WAS HER WORST MOMENT?" I WAS LIKE.... SOUNDS LIKE SHE MAY HAVE A LITTLE HUNGRY TIGER IN HER. ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO SEE YOU. - - WELL. SO DANA'S FRIEND CAME IN, AND IT WAS A GUY. ALL THE GIRLS WERE LIKE, "AH, FINALLY A GUY IS IN THE PENTHOUSE." THEY WANTED TO ATTACK HIM. IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY. - MEET PARIS. - HOW ARE YOU DOING, PARIS? - WHAT'S UP? NICE TO MEET YOU. - PLEASED TO MEET YOU. AND THE GIRLS. WOW, A BOY IN THE HOUSE. I'M KNOW YOU'RE MORE SENSIBLE. - HI, I'M REEM. - NICE TO MEET YOU. SO TELL ME WHY DANA WOULD MAKE A GOOD FRIEND. I MEAN... I DON'T KNOW, I SUPPOSE A SIGN THAT DANA IS A GOOD FRIEND IS THE FACT THAT I'M HERE NOW, YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE I WAS CALLED AT THE LAST MINUTE AND I'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO DO, AND THIS ISN'T MY SCENE, RIGHT? SO WHY AM I HERE? I'M HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT HER, AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE SHE'S A GOOD FRIEND TO ME, YOU KNOW, SO... I PRETTY... CAN'T TELL YOU MUCH YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT DANA. AND THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF YOU KNOW HER FOR TWO WEEKS, YOU PROBABLY KNOW HER REALLY WELL. DANA SEEMED VERY TIGHT WITH HER BFF AND THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. REEM'S BEST FRIEND IS IN KUWAIT, SO SHE WASN'T ABLE TO FLY OVER, BUT I GOT HER ON THE PHONE. - GRACIA? - Hello? TELL ME SOMETHING THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REEM. She really gets crazy crazy crazy sometimes. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Crazy fun, I mean crazy fun. I know... like, she can't do all these things, I'm sure at your show, but you really haven't seen anything crazy about Reem yet. I mean, she can get really crazy and fun. HUGE. DO YOU WANT TO SAY "HI" TO YOUR SISTER? Yeah, sure, please. HI. AW, IT'S SO CUTE THAT REEM'S BFF IS HER SISTER. SO SINCE EVERYBODY GOT TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS, AND REEM DIDN'T, YOU'RE COMING WITH ME TO THIS EVENT TONIGHT. YAY. THANK YOU. IT WAS GREAT TO MEET ALL THE BFFs. THEY ALL SEEMED TO HAVE PRETTY COOL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY CUTE THAT REEM AND HER SISTER ARE BEST FRIENDS, JUST LIKE ME AND MY SISTER. PUBLIC APPEARANCES ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB. IT CAN GET PRETTY INTENSE. MY FUTURE BFF NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO HANG. THIS IS PARIS HILTON TONIGHT! I'M HAVING THE BEST TIME. I LOVE EVERY ONE OF THEM. THE WOMEN HAVE SUCH AMAZING PASSION. AND I'M REALLY LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THEM. I JUST LOVE THE CULTURE HERE AND IT'S JUST A FABULOUS PLACE. IT'S VERY EXCITING. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO PARTY WITH PARIS. HI. HI, GIRL. GOING OUT FOR THE EVENING WITH PARIS WAS AMAZING. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING AND SHE GOT TO KNOW ME BETTER. AND, I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY NICE TO BE THERE WITH HER. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. REEM WAS QUIET BUT SWEET. I'M GLAD WE HAD A CHANCE TO HANG OUT, BUT TOMORROW IS AN ELIMINATION DAY. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. I GOT CALLED AWAY ON SOME BUSINESS, SO I HAD TO HAVE MY LITTLE STAR RELAY SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR ME. UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THE NEWS MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR HER. HI, GIRLS. HI, BRANKA. - HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD. PARIS ASKED ME, AS A LITTLE STAR, TO READ FOR YOU ONE MESSAGE. "I'M SORRY, THERE ARE THREE OF YOU I'M REALLY NOT SURE ABOUT. THESE THREE MUST PACK THEIR BAGS FOR ELIMINATION. YOU EACH HAVE A CAR WAITING DOWNSTAIRS. THE THREE WHO MUST PACK AND LEAVE NOW ARE... GELAREH." GELAREH. GELAREH? GELAREH? GELAREH, HOW SHE REACTED AS BEING ELIMINATED, WAS LIKE IN DENIAL. LIKE, "NO WAY THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME NOW." "AMY. BRANKA, PLEASE LEAVE... YOUR STAR NECKLACE IN THE PENTHOUSE. THE THREE OF YOU MUST PACK YOUR BAGS NOW." THIS IS NOT FAIR. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. I'M SO SAD. I FELT TERRIBLE THAT I COULDN'T BE THERE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE GIRLS. WE'RE STILL FRIENDS. YES. OOPS. AMY, HOW DO YOU FEEL? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T EVEN KNOW, LIKE, HOW TO FEEL RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T LEAVE. YOU CAN'T LEAVE. I LIKE YOU. - I KNOW, BABY, BUT... - YOU'RE COOL. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME AND YOU. - THIS IS ABOUT PARIS. - YEAH, BUT YOU'RE COOL, THOUGH. - BUT YOU'RE FUNNY AND ALL. - MAYBE SHE DOESN'T NEED FUNNY GIRLS. MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. - YOU DON'T KNOW. - YEAH. BE READY FOR SURPRISES BECAUSE LIFE IS ALWAYS LIKE THIS. IT'S UNFAIR. I'M CONFUSED, OF COURSE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW. I'M JUST TRYING TO, LIKE, GO OVER LIKE, WHAT THE LETTER SAID, YOU KNOW LIKE, "I'M UNSURE ABOUT YOU." LIKE, WHAT IS THAT? NOT SEEING PARIS BEFORE I LEAVE IS... YOU CAN'T THINK OF A WORD. I DON'T LIKE IT. THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT? LIKE, I JUST LEAVE? I WISH, IF I WAS ELIMINATED, PARIS WOULD TELL ME. PARIS WOULD SAY TO ME "FOR THIS REASON, YOU'RE ELIMINATED," NOT JUST BECAUSE "I DON'T KNOW YOU," OR "I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU." I DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT THAT IT'S ALL OVER. LET'S DO A LITTLE PRAYER. WHATEVER! AMY, GIRL. - BABY. - ALL RIGHT. GUYS, I JUST REALIZED THAT IT'S ONLY US FOUR. I'M LIKE, WAITING FOR THE OTHER GIRLS TO COME UP. IT'S NOT FAIR, LIKE... AT LEAST THE OTHER GIRLS WHO LEFT, LIKE, HAD REASONS WHY AND... YOU KNOW, THEY GOT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHY THEY SHOULD STAY OR WHY THEY'RE BETTER THAN... THAN ANYBODY TO BE PARIS'S FRIEND, BUT I DIDN'T GET TO SAY ANYTHING. AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY PARIS'S CHOICE SO, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE ONE WILL GO, MAYBE ALL OF US WILL GO. IT'S OVER, AND I FEEL BAD. I FEEL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T MEET ME... PERSONALLY, AS SHE MET ALL THE GIRLS. I HAVE THIS LITTLE STAR AND SHE KICK ME OUT. IT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT FAIR. I'M NOT HAPPY. I DON'T WANNA GO HOME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I WAS HONEST. I DIDN'T LIE. I WAS ME, MYSELF AND I, YOU KNOW? IT'S SUCH CRAP THAT DINA'S IN THE HOUSE. I HATE HER RIGHT NOW. DINA, YOU SEE... YOU SEE THAT SHE'S CHANGING HER PERSONALITY EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY, SHE WAS DIFFERENT. SHE'S ONE DAY TOUGH, SHE'S STRONG. SECOND DAY SHE KNOW... SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WANT. SHE, FOR THE LAST WEEK, HAS WANTED TO GO HOME... WANTED TO GO HOME. THEN SHE WAS LYING TOO MUCH, UH, WHAT I HATE. SHE TOLD ME THAT THE ONLY REASON SHE'S HERE IS JUST BECAUSE ALL OF US WANT HER TO LEAVE. SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PARIS. SHE DOESN'T CARE. SHE ONLY CARES ABOUT WINNING THE GAME AND BEATING THE OTHER GIRLS. I SHOULD BE STAYING INSTEAD OF DINA. AND SHE STAYS AND I GET THIS LETTER TO GO HOME? MY BAGS ARE PACKED AND I'M IN THE CAR AND I'M SO UPSET. I'M CRYING. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. I'M JUST SO HUNGRY. I PACKED EVERYTHING AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO HAVE LUNCH. I'M SO BUMMED. BUT THIS IS LIFE, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW, I VERY MUCH... IN LIFE, YOU BE GOOD AND YOU ALWAYS EAT... IN THE END. IT'S BETTER BE..., LIE, CHANGE YOURSELF, LIE FOR IT. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE GELAREH AND BRANKA WERE. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE WHERE WE WERE GOING UNTIL WE STOPPED AT THE AIRPORT. ELIMINATION AT THE AIRPORT? I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "IS THERE LIKE A CONFERENCE ROOM OR SOMETHING? LIKE, SOME KIND OF ELIMINATION CEREMONY IN THE AIRPORT?" I HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS COMING WITH ME, I HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS GOING. I HAD NO IDEA... CLUELESS. PARIS WANTED ME TO SAY SHE CAN ONLY HAVE ONE TRUE BFF, AND IT WON'T BE YOU. SHE HAS SENT YOU THIS MESSAGE. "T.T.Y.N.... TALK TO YOU NEVER." I'M VERY SERIOUS PERSON AND I HAVE FEELINGS. AND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR HER. AND SHE BELIEVED THIS DINA... FAKE, LIARS, AND EVERY... EVERYTHING! I CAN'T IMAGINE! OH. BYE. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEN I WAS JUST RUSH RUSH RUSH... RUSHED THROUGH THE AIRPORT WITH... PEOPLE TOOK MY LUGGAGE AWAY, PEOPLE TOOK MY PASSPORT AWAY. I DIDN'T HAVE A TICKET, I WAS JUST BEING PUSHED THROUGH THE AIRPORT. SO I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHERE I WAS GOING. AMY AND GELAREH MUST BE PRETTY CONFUSED RIGHT NOW. I HOPE THEY CAN KEEP IT TOGETHER. THEY'RE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE. I THOUGHT THAT THE ELIMINATION MIGHT BE AT THE AIRPORT. BUT IT WASN'T. WE WENT TO BEIRUT.
