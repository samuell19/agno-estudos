REMOVE THE WEITLANDER RETRACTOR. Female Nurse: WE'RE CLOSING, DOCTOR. REMOVE THE RAINEY CLIP, FOR GOD'S SAKE. I APPRECIATE YOUR LETTING ME OBSERVE THAT BRAIN OPERATION TODAY. IT WOULD'VE BEEN MORE COMPLICATED IF HE'D NEEDED ONE, BUT SINCE YOU WANTED TO OBSERVE MY TECHNIQUE, I- THAT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU. DOCTOR, WERE YOU, UH, WERE YOU INTERESTED IN SCIENCE AS A CHILD? I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS INTERESTED SO MUCH IN THE SCIENCE AS I WAS THE SLIME THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. SNAKES AND FROGS. WHEN I SAW HOW SLIMY THE HUMAN BRAIN WAS, I... I KNEW THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, TIMON? I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FISH. THEY TASTE FUNNY. REALLY? IT'S FRESH. IT CAME RIGHT OUT OF THAT TANK. YOU HOOKED MY ANGEL FISH?! WHY DO YOU DO THESE TERRIBLE THINGS? BECAUSE I LOVE TO SEE THOSE VEINS IN YOUR TEMPLE THROB. YOU-YOU- I'LL KILL YOU. LOOK HERE, YOU DEVIL WOMAN, YOU'LL NEVER DO THIS TO ANOTHER MAN! OH, YES, I WILL. I'LL DO IT, AND I'LL DO IT, AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN. WOULD YOU READ THAT BACK TO ME? I'M AFRAID THAT MIGHT MAKE ME SOUND POMPOUS TO YOUR READERS. UH, "MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH IN BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION "IS UNSURPASSED AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE MY NAME LIVE BEYOND ETERNITY." NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY." IT MAKES ME SOUND WISHY-WASHY. YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME, YOU IMPOTENT PRUNE! OHH! MY RENOIR! I'LL KILL YOU! I GET SO EXCITED WHEN YOU GET ANGRY. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER TO THE READING OF THE WILL. YOU WON'T GET A PENNY. I CHANGED MY WILL MONTHS AGO. YOU SON OF A BITCH. WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND ME A NEW MAN TO TORTURE. DR. FURRIER- THAT'S... HFUHRUHURR. I'M SORRY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF PEOPLE MISPRONOUNCE IT, BUT IT SOUNDS JUST THE WAY IT'S SPELLED. H- F-U-H-R-U-H-U-R-R. HFUHRUHURR. HFUHRUHURR-RUR. THAT'S GOOD. YOU JUST WENT A LITTLE PAST IT THERE. JUST PUT THE BRAKES ON A LITTLE SOONER. DOCTOR, I, UH... I KNOW YOU WERE QUITE SHAKEN BY THE TRAGIC DEATH OF YOUR WIFE. OH, I COULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT FOR A LONG WHILE, BUT... TIME PASSES BY, AND I CAN HANDLE IT NOW. HER NAME WAS REBECCA. WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! IS OOKIMS HAVING A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK? WHAT A SHAME, WITH ME SO YOUNG AND HOT! POM-POM! RIP HER THROAT OUT! AAH! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! DR. FURRIER! HFUHRUHURR! I'M SORRY. SHE WAS... EVERYTHING. IS THAT HER? NO.

YES, SIR? I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, ALL RIGHT? OK. I WANT YOU TO RUN HOME, AND I WANT YOU TO CALL THE E.R. OF NORTH BANK GENERAL HOSPITAL, 9-3-2-ONE THOUSAND. TELL THEM TO SET UP O.R. 6 IMMEDIATELY AND CONTACT ANESTHESIOLOGIST ISADORE TOURICK, 4-7-2-2-1-1-2, BEEP 12. HAVE THEM SEND AN AMBULANCE WITH A PARAMEDIC CREW, LIGHT I.V., D-5 AND W, KVO. YOU GOT IT?

THAT'S GOOD. SOUNDS LIKE A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA TO ME. OH, IT DOES, DOES IT? WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO DIAGNOSE. BUT I THOUGHT- YOU THOUGHT! YOU THOUGHT! JUST GO! 3 YEARS OF NURSERY SCHOOL, AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL! WELL, YOU'RE STILL WET BEHIND THE EARS. IT'S NOT A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA! IT'S EPIDURAL! HAH! GODDAMN, THAT MAKES ME MAD. I DON'T FIND THIS AMUSING, GARRERO! THIS IS A BETTER STORY THAN I EVER HOPED FOR. BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GETS HIT BY A CAR AND NEEDS BRAIN SURGERY, AND THE MAN WHO HITS HER IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST BRAIN SURGEON WHO OPERATES ON HER AND SAVES HER LIFE. IFI SAVE HER LIFE, OLSEN.IF. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, DR. BRANDON? AH, YES, MICHAEL. THIS OPERATION THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO PERFORM, I FEEL, IS VERY ILL-ADVISED. NO SURGEON SHOULD EVER OPERATE ON A PATIENT THAT HE HAS PERSONALLY INJURED. IT WOULD MAKE HIM TOO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED. DON'T YOU THINK I'M AWARE OF THAT? BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON I'D TRUST TO PERFORM THIS OPERATION-BECKERMANN. DR. BECKERMANN WAS MURDERED IN EUROPE. YOU KNOW THAT. EXACTLY! NOT ONLY IS HE DEAD, HE'S 6,000 MILES AWAY. WHAT IS THAT? It's a vagina. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I MEAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHAVING HER. THIS IS A BRAIN OPERATION. I KNOW. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE, A HEART? YES, SIR. CLIVE AND I THOUGHT THAT SINCE IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY THAT- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHAVE HER ANYWHERE. WE'LL BE USING MY CRANIAL SCREWTOP METHOD OF ENTRY INTO THE BRAIN. FINE. YES, SIR. I NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN. I SUPPOSE IF IT WERE CHRISTMAS, YOU'D HANG ORNAMENTS ON IT. FORCEPS. METZENBAUM SCISSORS. 10-BLADE SCALPEL. Female nurse: 10-BLADE. SPONGE STICK.

IN A HOSPITAL. YOU'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT. OH. I HOPE I HAVEN'T CAUSED ANY TROUBLE. OH, NO. Dolores: I'M SO TIRED. SHH SHH SHH SHH. WHO ARE YOU? OH, I'M-I'M YOUR DOCTOR. I WANT- OH, DON'T- DON'T TRY AND TALK. DOCTOR. HUH? YOU'RE WANTED IN O.R. 6 IN 5 MINUTES. THANK YOU. OHH. CONTINUE THE DILANTIN I.V. WHAT A SKULL. OHH. BOY, WOULD I LIKE TO JUMP ON THOSE BONES. REBECCA. I CAN'T HELP COMPARING HER TO YOU. SHE HAS A BEHIND SO SEXY YOU'D LIKE TO EAT LUNCH OFF IT. JUST LIKE WE DID, REMEMBER? REBECCA. I'VE HAD THE TOP OF HER HEAD OFF, BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS IT WENT. I PROMISE I'LL NEVER RECITE OUR FAVORITE POEM TO ANYONE BUT YOU. IN DILMAN'S GROVE. IN DILMAN'S GROVE, MY LOVE DID DIE, AND NOW IN GROUND, SHE'LL EVER LIE. NONE COULD E'ER REPLACE HER VISAGE, UNTIL YOUR FACE BROUGHT THOUGHTS OF KISSAGE. NURSE. GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. MAKE A NOTE. RIGHT ARM GRIP STRENGTH VERY GOOD. LEFT ARM'S-THERE'S JUST NO IMPROVEMENT. I WENT OUT AND GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT. "THE COMPLETE POEMS OF JOHN LILYSON."

HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON EVER TO BE HIT BY A CAR. TO THINK YOU WERE ALMOST KILLED BY A CAR. MICHAEL. THAT'S ALL OVER NOW. THAT MAN YOU RAN AWAY FROM THAT NIGHT... POOR OLD MR. CRESWELL. IT WAS ALL MY FAULT, IN A WAY. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE THERE ALONE. I GUESS I'M JUST TOO TRUSTING. OH, POOR LITTLE BIRD. SO FRAGILE. SO NAIVE. SO CHILDLIKE. SO SHY. SO CHASTE. SO INNOCENT. REBECCA. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY FEELINGS FOR DOLORES, JUST GIVE ME A SIGN. NO! NO! NO! NO! JUST ANY KIND OF SIGN. I'LL KEEP ON THE LOOKOUT FOR IT. MEANWHILE, I'LL JUST PUT YOU IN THE CLOSET. IN SICKNESS OR IN HEALTH TILL DEATH DO YOU PART? I DO. I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE. YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE. NOT NOW. THERE IT IS, DARLING. YOUR NEW HOME. THE HOUSE OF HFUHRUHURR. WHAT ARE THOSE ASSHOLES DOING ON THE PORCH? THOSE AREN'T ASSHOLES. IT'S PRONOUNCED "AZALEAS." I PUT THEM THERE FOR YOU. SENOR. NO, RAMON. MY WIFE WILL NOT BE ENTERING HER NEW HOME IN A WHEELCHAIR. I WANT THIS MOMENT TO LAST FOREVER. SENOR? SENOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO EAT YOUR BREAKFAST NOW? HAVE YOU TAKEN ENOUGH PHOTOS OF THE MOMENT SO WE CAN REMEMBER THIS MOMENT FOREVER? OH, YES. AND WE GOT THEM BACK ALREADY. SEE? OH, THAT'S NICE. ALL RIGHT, BREAKFAST. WE'LL GET CLEANED UP FIRST. ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO WALK OUT HERE. I'M HAPPY TO SAY HE IS STILL BUSY MAKING HIS... LOOK, I FRAMED THE MOMENT. MM-HMM. HE'S NOW ABOUT TO UNVEIL HIS LATEST PICTURE, WHICH I HEAR IS JUST AMAZING, OPENING ON THE 21st OF THIS MONTH- YUCK. WAIT. TURN THAT BACK. THAT'S MY FAVORITE MOVIE. THAT'SDONOVAN'S BRAIN. AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF DECAY? NONE. I'VE NEVER SEEN HEALTHIER TISSUE. IT'S GROWING LARGER BY THE DAY. IT'S DISGUSTING. BRAINS ARE SO UGLY. NO. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I'M LATE! IS THAT ALL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FOR BREAKFAST? IT'S ALL I HAVE TIME FOR. HOW DO YOU FEEL? OH, I'M FINE. I JUST... WISH I COULD GET OUT OF THIS WHEELCHAIR SO I COULD HELP A LITTLE AROUND THE HOUSE. YOU WILL. YOU JUST HAD A MAJOR OPERATION. IT TAKES TIME TO RECOVER. YOU'RE GONNA BE UP AND AROUND IN NO TIME. JUST BE PATIENT. DOLORES? SOON? HUH? HUH? Michael: FORGOT MY HAT. OOH! OHH! YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED! I SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN UP, BUT I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU AND WALK INTO YOUR ARMS TONIGHT WHEN YOU CAME HOME. YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. WHO IS THAT MAN OUT THERE? JUAN. HE WORKS FOR RAMON. OH. HE FRIGHTENED ME. HE'S JUST A BIG, GOOD-NATURED BAG OF MUSCLES. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT MAKES ME QUIVER. IS HE HERE OFTEN? JUST ONE DAY A WEEK. WHAT DAY? TUESDAY. IS HE EVER ALONE? I MEAN, DOES RAMON EVER GO OFF AND LEAVE HIM HERE ALONE? SOMETIMES. WHY? I'D LIKE TO KNOW. PLEASE, TELL RAMON TO WARN ME WHEN HE'S GONNA LEAVE ME ALONE WITH THAT JUAN PERSON. ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. THAT'LL MAKE ME FEEL MUCH BETTER. FRIGHTENED LITTLE MOUSE. I'LL TELL RAMON TO WARN HER ABOUT JUAN. RAMON! MICHAEL, MICHAEL, HOW IS MARRIED LIFE? I DON'T KNOW! I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN ON EDGE THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. MICHAEL! AAH! SEE? THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE. OH, GOD, I ALMOST PEED IN THE SCRUB BASIN. I DON'T KNOW WHY I'VE BEEN SO TENSE. MAYBE IT'S YOUR COFFEE. NO. WHEN A WOMAN WHO'S JUST HAD MAJOR BRAIN SURGERY TELLS YOU SHE HAS A HEADACHE, YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN. OH. PATIENCE, MICHAEL. A RECENTLY MARRIED WOMAN AND AN EAGER YOUNG HUSBAND- IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE YOU HEAR HER SAY, "TAKE ME! TAKE ME!" TAKE ME. TAKE ME. OHH. OHH, JUAN. YOU... YOU'RE THROUGH! I DON'T THINK I AM. NOT YOU. BY THE WAY, I FIRED RAMON YESTERDAY. RAMON? BUT RAMON IS SUCH A FINE MAN. WHAT DID HE DO? HE CAME UP BEHIND ME, AND HE GRABBED MY BREASTS. WHAT? IHAVEN'T EVEN DONE THAT YET. I KNOW. I TOLD HIM THAT. YOU TOLD HIM? HE SAID HE HAD TO MEASURE ME FOR A NEW DASHBOARD ORNAMENT. HE TOLD ME HE HAD TO MEASURE REBECCA A LOT BEFORE HE GOT HER RIGHT. OH, YOU'RE UPSET. SO AM I. I WANT TO BE EVERYTHING TO YOU REBECCA WAS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU... EVERYTHING SHE GAVE YOU, DO EVERYTHING SHE DID. WHEN CAN YOU START? HOW SOON CAN YOU GET HOME? WELL, I HAVE 2 OPERATIONS, BUT I CAN DO THEM FAST. THEY'RE JUST BRAIN OPERATIONS. LET ME GET MY HAT. MY BRIEFCASE. COULD YOU WALK ME TO THE DOOR? WHAT'S HE DOING? 2 BRAIN OPERATIONS AT THE SAME TIME.

IT'LL DO ME GOOD. WHERE'S MY HAT? IT'S... THE BREEZE FEELS GOOD. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? MICHAEL, I'M, UH, CONCERNED ABOUT YOU. REALLY? WHAT'S THE CONCERN? MY STAFF TELLS ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE TENSE LATELY. TENSE? IS THAT WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ME? MICHAEL, EVEN TO ME, YOU SEEM A LITTLE JUMPY. JUMPY?! HOW ARE THINGS AT HOME, MICHAEL? GREAT. I'M MARRIED TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD. HOW COULD IT BE ANYTHING BUT GREAT?! IT'S GONNA BE EVEN GREATER! JUST AS SOON AS WE... 6 WEEKS AND YOU HAVEN'T MADE LOVE TO YOUR WIFE YET? NO WONDER YOU'RE TENSE. DR. BRANDON, THE WOMAN HAS JUST HAD MAJOR BRAIN SURGERY. SHE'S HAD ENOUGH UNPLEASANTNESS. I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IN THE FINGER-SUCKING DEPARTMENT I AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AUSTRIA, MICHAEL? NO. THE AUSTRIAN INSTITUTE OF CRANIOLOGY HAS ASKED MANY TIMES FOR YOU TO LECTURE THERE ON YOUR THEORY OF BRAIN TRANSPLANTS. WHY NOT TAKE THEM UP ON IT? COMBINE A BUSINESS TRIP WITH A HONEYMOON. HONEYMOON. YEAH. I GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET US STARTED. WHEN ARE YOU SCHEDULED TO HAVE YOUR HANDS REMOVED FROM YOUR FACE? 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON. THEN YOU COULD DO THE VOITLANDER SURGERY FOR ME. OF COURSE! HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT INSTANT GLUE. I KNOW. HERE'S THE VOITLANDER CHART. A HONEYMOON. YEAH. HONEYMOON! MAY I HELP YOU, SIR? YES, I'M DR. HFUHRUHURR. I BELIEVE YOU'RE HOLDING A ROOM FOR ME. YES. WOULD YOU PREFER A DOUBLE OR TWIN BEDS? A DOUBLE. AH, A DOUBLE. COULD YOU SEND UP A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND PUT A "DO NOT DISTURB" ON THE PHONE FOR THE NEXT- UM, LET'S SEE. WE GO IN, PUT OUR BAGS DOWN START KISSING, BE ABOUT 7 MINUTES. MOVE INTO THE BEDROOM, SLIDE MY HANDS OVER HER DRESS, I REMOVE HER BLOUSE, MAYBE 4 OR 5 MINUTES. MOVE OVER TO THE BED, RUB EACH INNER THIGH, THAT WOULD BE 4 MINUTES EACH, SO I FIGURE 25 MINUTES OF FOREPLAY IN GENERAL... DO YOU CALL ORAL SEX FOREPLAY OR ACTUAL SEX? DOESN'T MATTER. I'D LIKE TO DO IT TWICE, SO AT LEAST 3 HOURS, ALL RIGHT? 3 HOURS?! YES, SIR. TAKE MRS. HFUHRUHURR AND THAT LUCKY SON OF A BITCH UP TO SUITE 729. YES, SIR. I NEVER IN MY WILDEST IMAGINATION EVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE LIKE THAT. IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING SEXUAL ENCOUNTER- WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING IT- THAT I EVER ALMOST HAD. DOCTOR, I'M DR. FELIX CONRAD. I'LL BE ESCORTING YOU TO THE LECTURE HALL. DID YOU JUST STEP OFF THAT ELEVATOR? THERE WAS NO OPERATOR. THEY'RE ALL AFRAID. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT VIENNA'S ELEVATOR KILLER? ELEVATOR KILLER? PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING ON ELEVATORS ON ONE FLOOR ONLY TO ARRIVE AT ANOTHER FLOOR DEAD. LIKE BECKERMAN. JA.DR. SCHLERMIE BECKERMAN. A BRILLIANT BRAIN SURGEON. ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. IT WAS A GREAT LOSS. I'M THANKFUL YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. THE ACADEMY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING YOU LECTURE THIS MORNING. I HOPE I DON'T RUFFLE ANY FEATHERS. MY SPEECH MIGHT BE A LITTLE RADICAL FOR THE OLD GUARD. IT WOULD TAKE QUITE A BIT TO SHOCK ANY OF THIS CROWD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I CAN ENVISION A DAY WHEN THE BRAINS OF BRILLIANT MEN CAN BE KEPT ALIVE IN THE BODIES OF DUMB PEOPLE. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? THEY'RE JUST SAYING "MURMUR MURMUR MURMUR." IT'S JUST SORT OF A GENERAL MURMUR? YEAH. MURMUR. OH. YOU MAY MURMUR ALL YOU LIKE- BUT TO MAKE TRANSPLANTATION POSSIBLE I HAVE RECENTLY INVENTED THE CRANIAL SCREWTOP METHOD OF ENTRY INTO THE BRAIN WHEREBY A LARGE SECTION CAN BE UNSCREWED WITHOUT HAVING TO SHAVE THE HEAD. AND AS A SAFETY FEATURE, I'VE MADE IT CHILDPROOF. TO OPEN, YOU PUSH DOWN WHILE TURNING... AND VOIL?, THE HUMAN BRAIN. WHERE IS THIS MAN'S BRAIN? STOLEN! IT'S THE FOURTH INCIDENT THIS MONTH. I WISH TO APOLOGIZE TO OUR AMERICAN COLLEAGUE. THIS DEMONSTRATION IS NOW CONCLUDED. DR. HMFHRUHRR? IT'S CLOSE. YES? I'M DR. ALFRED NECESSITER. WELL, WELL, WELL. DR. ALFRED NECESSITER. WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK? A DRINK WOULD BE INTERESTING. I ENJOYED YOUR LECTURE TODAY. WHAT LECTURE? THEY GAVE ME A HEAD WITH 3 LEMONS IN IT. THAT'S WHY I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH. I DIDN'T HAVE TO HEAR YOUR BRILLIANT BUT OLD-FASHIONED THEORIES ON THE HUMAN BRAIN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OLD-FASHIONED"? I'M THE MOST ADVANCED BRAIN MAN WORKING TODAY. I DON'T THINK SO. READ THIS ARTICLE. LOOK AT THE UNDERLINED PART. AND LOOK AT THIS. READ THE CAPTION UNDER THE PHOTO. AND THESE- NEWSWEEK, TIME, COSMO. NATIONAL ENQUIRER- DOLLY PARTON WANTS TO HAVE MY BABY. DON'T TELL ME I'M OLD-FASHIONED. I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU, DOCTOR! YOU'RE THE MOST BRILLIANT BRAIN MAN WORKING TODAY. THAT'S WHY I'M MOST ANXIOUS TO SHARE MY WORK WITH YOU. IT SEEMS YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WHO MIGHT UNDERSTAND IT. AND I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID HERE. "MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH IN BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION "IS UNSURPASSED AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE MY NAME LIVE BEYOND ETERNITY." I TOLD HIM TO TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY." MY LABORATORY IS SET UP IN MY HOME. IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT, I COULD SHOW YOU MY WORK. WHEN? NOW! ALL RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY." YOU KNOW, THAT PHOTOGRAPH DOESN'T DO YOU JUSTICE. WELL, HELLO. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE. OW! OH, YOU DIRTY... Necessiter: WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME. BEING IN AUSTRIA AND MEETING A SCIENTIST WITH YOUR INTERESTS, I HALF EXPECTED YOUR LABORATORY TO BE IN A CASTLE, NOT A CONDO. YOU MEAN... LIKE THIS? YEAH. THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. JESUS. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY. FROM THE OUTSIDE, IT DOES NOT LOOK THIS ROOMY. I HAD A GOOD DECORATOR. MY WIFE. IT'S AMAZING WHAT SHE DID WITH A FEW THROW PILLOWS, SOME WALLPAPER, AND A STAPLE GUN. LEAPIN' LIZARDS. YES. WE HAVE THOSE. MOAT WITH ALLIGATOR... HERE'S OUR SMALL ENTRANCE HALL. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH CLOSET SPACE? THERE NEVER IS. NO. THEY FILL UP SO FAST. THIS IS THE TV ROOM. OH, I LOVE THE WAY IT'S SO DREARY. THIS, DOCTOR... IS MY LABORATORY. BRAINS. I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY BRAINS OUT OF THEIR HEADS BEFORE. FEEL LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE. DON'T TOUCH IT! WHY? THEY'RE ALIVE. ALIVE. BUT THERE'S NO WIRES OR TUBES OR THAT "BZZ" THING. HOW ARE THEY KEPT ALIVE? WITH A SPECIAL FLUID I DEVELOPED. WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL THESE BRAINS? MY VISION IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE THOUGHTS AND DATA FROM A DYING BRAIN AND TRANSFER THEM INTO ANOTHER BODY WITHOUT OPENING THE SKULL. WOULD YOU CARE FOR A DRINK? PLEASE. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE? A TAHITIAN LADY. RIGHT-O. FLAMING? OH, NO, NO. THAT'S FOR TOURISTS. WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR BRAINS? THE CITY MORGUE. FOR A NICE TIP THEY SEND ME BRAINS FROM BODIES THAT HAVE DIED IN THE RIGHT WAY. WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY FOR A BODY TO DIE? FOR MY PURPOSE, AN INJECTION OF 200 CCs OF AMMONIATED STRYCHNOCLORAHYPE INTO THE BUTTOCKS, CAUSING THE BRAIN TO DIE LAST. THANK YOU. AMMONIATED STRYCH- THAT'S WINDOW CLEANER. THAT'S THE EXACT INGREDIENTS IN WINDOW CLEANER. YES. AND WHO DOES THE INJECTING, DR. NECESSITER, YOU? GOOD LORD, NO. IT'S THE ELEVATOR KILLER, BLESS HIS HEART. YOU'RE CONDONING MURDER, AREN'T YOU, DR. NECESSITER? AS LONG AT IT'S HAPPENING, I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT IT. THE ONLY TIME WE DOCTORS SHOULD ACCEPT DEATH IS WHEN IT'S CAUSED BY OUR OWN INCOMPETENCE. NONSENSE! IF THE MURDER OF 12 INNOCENT PEOPLE CAN SAVE ONE HUMAN LIFE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT. WORTH IT? YOU'RE CONDONING MURDER! I'M NOT CONDONING MURDER, SIR! Woman: SHUT UP IN THERE! RESEARCH AND MURDER DO NOT GO TOGETHER! AND YOU SHUT UP! WITH YOUR TV BLARING ALL NIGHT AND YOUR 6 GRANDCHILDREN RUNNING DOWN THE HALLS! I'M SORRY, DOCTOR. THESE WALLS LOOK SOLID, BUT THEY'RE THIN AS TISSUE PAPER. THAT'S TYPICAL FOR A CONDO. NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW FAR I'VE PROGRESSED WITH MY EXPERIMENTS. YOU KNEW A SCHLERMIE BECKERMAN? YOU'VE GOT SCHLERMIE IN ONE OF THOSE JARS LIKE SO MUCH MARMALADE? NO! HE ISN'T IN A JAR! HE'S WALKING AND TALKING. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I SAW PHOTOS OF THE BODY. ITISPOSSIBLE. I MUST WARN YOU, DOCTOR... WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE... MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS THE MOST INCREDIBLE, AWESOME- EXCUSE ME. INCREDIBLE, AWESOME WHAT? JUST A MINUTE. HELLO? YES? I'LL BE THERE IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. WHAT WAS THAT AWESOME THING? I MUST LEAVE NOW. I HAVE A NEW BRAIN TO PICK. THE ELEVATOR KILLER HAS STRUCK AGAIN. WHAT ABOUT BECKERMAN AND INCREDIBLE? COME FOR DINNER TONIGHT AND BRING MRS. FURREAR. HFUHRUHURR. HFUHRUHURR. 8:00.
