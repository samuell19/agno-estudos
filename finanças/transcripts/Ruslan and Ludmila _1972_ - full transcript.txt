KHRENNIKOVA as Young Naina A. KRYCHENKOV as Jester O. KHABALOV as Pecheneg Warlord Yu. KIREYEV as Russian Warrior An honest tale of bygone days, A legend of heroic ways... I liberate you, Oh Pechenegs. Your promise hold for evermore, Remember, Holy Russia Must be untouched by hands of war! Warrior bold, gallant and true, Your victory was sent by Fate! Fly now to Kiev, Eagle of Stars, Where your loved one does you wait. Highness, the victory is ours! Broken is the prisoner's chain. Ruslan once more has won the battle. He's now hurrying back again! Let everyone be summoned here! Sweet Mother Russia we shall praise! The heart rejoices, our folk's free, The brimming wine cup to our lips we'll raise! Vladimir, true Prince and our Savior! Father of Russia, now free! You whose realm knows no equal, Wear you the crown of victory! Fate is against us, Oh my father, Ludmila to another man'll be wed. 'Tis better we should hope abandon. The maid will never grace my bed. Wait, dear son, profound my plans. I'll talk to the Pecheneg Khan. Not ours, but other hands Will arrange the demise of Ruslan! Ah warrior, I'm glad to see Your coming back with victory! So many long long nights and days I sat at the window and I gazed And then afar I seemed to hear The battle noises ringing clear. And my reward of victory Was to return again for thee, To see once more the sacred land, To stand beside you, hand in hand. Your dream is now coming right, My valiant eagle, my true knight! Our Khazar land's in sorry plight. Ludmila's dowry can it restore. Ratmir, my son, that is a fact We cannot easily ignore! My father, there's no need to fear. No maid on earth resists Ratmir. I warrant you that to your home Ludmila shall as daughter come. To sway the Prince, so that certainly He won't turn deaf ear to your plea, I will present a gift of worth, The finest steed upon the earth! Pay heed, my son, be wise and patient. Ludmila is a very fine catch. Prince needs support, he's getting ancient, There are so few that your sword can match! I worthy am to have her for my own, And worthy too of honors great. What if she makes the choice of her own? Her father will decide her fate! Farlaf, to banqueting again you go? I ride to Kiev without delay! But wait! Nay, lass, I must go now. I banquet with the Prince today! A suitor you perhaps would turn? You wish Ludmila to get in chain? Mayhap, a bridegroom I'll return. In me Vladimir a son shall gain! Rich gifts from Caesar we present. He perseveres in his intent. His Highness us would not offend, To our suitor he'll give consent! Drinkin rejoice, feast, one and all! And may the Prince's will be done! His lovely daughter is to marry The heroic, gallant knight, Ruslan! Drink, dance and sing, the merry folks! It is the day of revelry and jokes! Pour wine, and bottoms up! And then again refill your cup! The Byzantine suitor's envoy and fan. The last to come, such arrogance. It makes one puke to watch such men Around the Prince servilely dance. Good guests, let us rejoice together. And glorify this lovely shrine! And fill our golden cups to level With frothy mead and heady wine. The princess is lovely, fairer than the lily. She's a true daughter of the Slav! Such grace, such beauty does she have! Fairer than daughters of Francony. Yes, but the damsel's not for us. It profits not to fret and fuss. And who is this noble Prince? Ruslan? The terror of the Pechenegs. They cringe 'fore him like wild dogs Or hide in terror of the man. And who are those sad-faced men, Sitting dejectedly, all three? They're the maid's rejected suitors, Cruelly racked by jealousy. There I spy Rogdai, warrior bold Whose sword brought more land for Kiev to hold. - And that one? - Farlaf, a glutton unbridled. In eating and drinking by none is he rivaled. But in the field he's not one to shine. And the other, brooding, his eyes so fine? Ratmir, heir to Khazar, 'tis said. Festivities aren't time to pine. What would you say? Their hope has fled. I give you my blessing, children. I drink to your many years to live! She who on earth is my dearest treasure To you, Ruslan, I gladly give. Love her and cherish her forever, Whatever she asks of you, fulfil. May nothing on earth your happiness sever, And keep her safe from every ill! Unto death I shall protect her, And this I hereby swear, great King! My life is hers, yea everything Unto the tomb, my dear Ludmila. O greatest Prince, the hour's here That I must go to another home. My sweetest father, it makes me sorrow That now I must leave you all alone. Rogdai! Ratmir! Farlaf! Forgive me. There was no way but to refuse You three. My daughter, my Ludmila Of her heart Ruslan did choose. Ruslan? Whatever in the world he is that I ain't? Alas! I'll have to go home alone... Be happy, Prince Ruslan valiant! Be cursed, my rival, forever on! Play, music, sweetly, with caress, While to your tune I'll sing a praise To Ludmila's beauty and finesse, To Ruslan's fighting strength and grace. For the newlyweds may they prepare A gorgeous matrimonial bed, And as the old custom fare, The green, heady hops adorn its head. And may they bliss there in the care Ofjolly Lel, the lovers' god. The Prince invites you, 'tis his whim To play a game of chess with him! A fearful challenge, I confess. A charging boar would scare me less. Ludmila, Ruslan is at your feet, And will remain for evermore. What joy everlasting, beloved heart, My starry eagle... Whom I adore! Ludmila! Ludmila! - The Prince is winning. - The game is his. Father! Disaster upon us is! My child? Ludmila? Speak out, say! By sorcery from us is carried away! Out of my sight, no more art thou A son of mine! You broke your vow... Guests and companions! If human pity touches your heart, See this old man, and take his part! Speak, is there man among you Who my child's abductor will pursue? A man whose vows are firm and true? The man, yes, hide your head, villain vile, Who failed to protect my only child, That man shall have Ludmila for a bride My thanks, and half my lands beside. I shall go! He should go and hide! I shall go! I! Farlaf, Rogdai? And I! The gallant Khan Ratmir? To horse, to horse without delay. We shall find your daughter, do not fear. Your Highness, I must not bide here longer. The Princess we leave to seek and find. Now may your valor be the stronger And restore again my peace of mind. At last! The taste is sweet Of freedom! When will we meet - The prospect likes me well - a giant? The blood'll pour as passions seethe And victims offer to the sabre! Rejoice, my blade and loyal steed! And freely go prance and caper! 'Tis time to part, my friends, I say Let us chance fate. So 'tis decided. May each horse be given its own way, And fly by the touch of spur unguided! I bid you welcome, my son! At last! I greet you here, Ruslan, most warmly. Here have I twenty long years passed Of my old age, and grim and lonely They've been. But now has come the day For which, foreseeing it, I waited. To meet, we two, my son, were fated. Now sit and hear me out, I pray. Know this, Ruslan, a wizard's done you wrong, A wicked sorcerer, Chernomor. Of lovely maidens the abductor, the dweller of the mountain shore. No more can I say. On you two fates, My son, depend, Yours and your mate's. I make too bold to ask you this; You, who befriend me, I importune. Speak! Tell me, confidant of fortune, Why came you to this wilderness? Be seated, son. My land of birth Lies in a distant part of the earth. Under somber sky. A Finn am I. Those valleys in memory come to me. I guarded flocks in meadow and lea. In the time of my carefree youth I knew the forests and the streams, Grottoes and rocks, it is the truth, And youth's modest pleasures and its dreams. Not long, for I the truth can tell, Did I in this contentment dwell. My destiny upon me fell... Naina was she I loved so well. I opened my heart. To her said l: Naina, I love you, for you will die! I pray that you shall something say! You, shepherd, I despise. Go away! 'Twas then that I, so cruelly banned, Did leave my lovely native land. I sailed the oceans, unafraid, On gory battlefields I fought To win Naina's love I sought. For I did love the naughty maid. My tender yearning would not leave me At festive board, or in the field, To see my homeland and Naina And by the sight of them be healed. Behold, I am returned, Naina. I bring you gifts fit for a queen, Coral, and gold, and pearls and rubies I and my men fought hard to win. Ne'er were you, maid, by me forgot. I love you, love you, sweet Naina! Oh hero, I say I love you not! At this, in sheer despair and sadness I turned to sorcery, Oh Knight, Think how cruel was my plight! By magic wiles, a pray to madness Her heart I sought to set alight. Deep in the murk of leafy forests Over books of witchcraft did I pore, And for a hermit's cave, the pleasures Of life for countless years forswore. Oh hero, I say I love you not! Oh hero, I say I love you not! Then came the day of victory. To her cold heart I held the key. Full of feverish elation And joy, I spoke the incantation. Adored Naina, mine you art! Fill you the void within my heart. Oh horror! Naina, your beauty! Can this really be you? Ah say, is it wrath of the gods That made such ruin of you? Ah say, was it long in the past I abandoned the world and my joy? Was it long? Half a century. My age is now seventy, my boy. But what's the use of us lamenting? The passing of youth is no lack. 'Tis true my steps now are halting. I'm grey, and have a hump on my back. Less spritely I am, and less spry To lead the heroes' hearts awry. But then this do I freely confess: I am now a practised sorceress. You too are old, my chosen mate, But passion sometimes does come late. I swear it by the gods above, My heart but now is ripe for love. For you and your embrace I hunger. I burn with love, I am aflame. Whatjoy, what rapture, and what languor, Come to Naina, she's yours to claim! You insulting dog! I was at peace, now my peace has vanished. You won Naina's love, And you did her deny. Despised is she, slighted, banished. All men are traitors, rogues and swine! Alas, the blame is mostly thine. You thief of hearts, you traitor base, I'll be revenged for my shame and disgrace! The witch loves evil far too well. To do you harm she will endeavor. And yet your doubts I'd dispel, For grief and pain are not forever. Farewell, Ruslan, sorrow mends with time! Farewell, and heed these counsels of mine! Ruslan! Where is he, my chosen, my love? Ruslan! Ruslan! Find solace, dear Princess fair! Your suffering is all in vain! These lushy gardens will ease your pain, To grieve anymore one must not dare. A captive, from my lover torn, why Should I not end it all and die? Oh, villain, you who me torment Yet humor me, such is your whim But I... I scorn you and contempt. I'll take my death, sorrowful and grim! Amidst this beauty, magical and kingly You must rejoice, forget your gloom. The fountains like birds are singing, And diamond flowers are in bloom. This gauzy tent wherein I sit, These songs, a lovelorn heart's outpouring, Which, for all that, are rather boring, In faith, I need them not a whit! And saying that, she started to eat. Come no closer your lust on me to wreak! Abortion! Monstrosity! Bearded freak! My beard is caught beneath the bed! Tear it not or I'll have your head! Monster misbegotten... You are depraved and rotten! That one is happy who is free, Who finds refuge in a cozy shed, Devoid of any care or grief, With a cup of good wine in his hand... That one is happy who is merry, With no burden on his mind... Ruslan? Alone? With no steed? I'll teach you a lesson now, indeed! Beware, Ruslan! Your head I'll smite! Protect me, Gods, and turn me right! Just let me catch you. You're dead! I'll make you shorter by a head! Now, poltroon, you'll have to die! - Farlaf? - Yes, that's me, Rogdai! To take Farlaf for Prince Ruslan? That only could do a very drunk man! You've got mistaken? Never mind. Go there, and you'll him find! Arise, Farlaf, no need to fear, 'Tis only Naina appearing here. Pay heed to the words of mine, lovely youth: In peace none can journey the world, forsooth. By Kiev with your father rather stay Than voyage far all livelong day. Stay there and count not the hours. And shortly Ludmila shall be ours. Stay, valiant knight, ride not away! Rogdai is here to fight and slay! Hard have I ridden to meet you. In manful combat to unseat you! 'Tis you that'll perish away from your mother For seeking to steal the bride of another! Die, rival mine, and pay the cost! Your life in combat you have lost! Farlaf! What's the matter? I don't believe. I just escaped by the skin of my teeth! You hardly hold on your feet... For days I nothing had to eat. I fought with a giant, evil and smug. Though he put a spell over sword of mine, I still succeeded with this very mug To split his head down to his spine! Oh my beloved! You are a hero! Of good causes gallant cavaliero! - Naina, you? 'Tis nothing tragic? - Greetings, my brother in magic. Grave news bring I. On vengeance sore, The most feared of all the knights, Comes over snow and icy heights Ruslan, magnificent in war! My thanks, Naina! Yet I say Chernomor fears none of mortal clay. Set not at naught this beard so long. As long as it remains intact None can me hurt, however strong. It does protect me if attacked. - What of Ruslan? - His fate is sealed. - My Lord speaks truth? - Ruslan will yield. I put it on, I disappear! I raise it, and I am here! What hat is this? Good morrow, wizard! I have nothing to fear! In possessing this piece of wear I shall no longer have a care! I put on my turban, And I am not there! You slaves and servants of my guard, Hasten in coming to my side! Ludmila's here, you must find her Wherever she may try to hide! Or, and I swear I make no joke, To death you all with this beard I'll choke! Here's the turban. It's plain to see, And now, idiots, try to catch me! Think you can trick me, Chernomor? You'll tire soon and mock no more! We know not where Ludmila can be! The blame for this belongs to me. I've searched the whole palace thru, The garden and the waterfall, too. The summer house and every place. Ludmila vanished without a trace! Night cloaks the lea; from far away The chilling winds of ocean carry. Come, youthful roamer, do not tarry; Take shelter in our castle, pray! The nights in languid calm we spend, The days in feasts and merrymaking. Come, youthful wanderer, attend This fete of ours, to joy awaking. We many are and beauties all; Our lips are soft, our speeches tender. Come, youthful wanderer, surrender And heed ourjoyous, secret call! O speak O field! Tell who's spread Over you the bones of the dead? Oho! You're living, no mistake! Do you hear me? I bid you, head, awake! Be off there! Hide you from my sight! I wish to sleep, for it is night. Why come you here to trouble me in vain? Pay heed. I wish you to explain Where and on what distant shore The castle stands of Chernomor? You seek the wizard to fight with him? You're a fool, despite your daring! Great Chernomor has powers grim, And he's strong beyond comparing. You're hardly sitting on your horse. Enough, enough of such discourse! I have full many a battle won. If I come at you, your life's done! I see your heart is flaming. Your temerity may need taming. You'll break your neck, my friend. Beware... Strike me a mighty blow and sound. Come tarry not, but do and dare Before your horse falls to the ground. Forbear, warrior! Your urgent plea Makes me good reason now to see. I was trying your mettle: You're he Whom the gods in heaven sent to me. Now listen to my story true! I was a knight, and fearless too! But fate a tyrant against me sent, He was my brother, on mischief bent. T'was Chernomor, the sorcerer strong, Born a dwarf with a beard so long. He hated me whose giant height Ever to him did seem a slight. One night as I lay sleeping, he Crept up with murderous stealth on me. And at a stroke cut off my head Which is doomed to live, though I be dead. The magic sword I guard by his will. And until I'm avenged, I live still! You, gallant hero, you can avenge me. Take thou the sword, and may the gods go with thee. The midget's strength, remember, is Held magically in the beard of his! Chop off his beard, and you'll see Chernomor as helpless as a flea. Your counsel, head, I'll not ignore, I'll break the spells of Chernomor! End of Part I MOSFILM Artistic Association "Yunost" RUSLAN AND LUDMILA Based on the poem by A.S. PUSHKIN Part II Grave news I bring to you, my lord: Ruslan does angry here make speed, And being armed with the magic sword, Chopping your beard is all his heed. Ruslan, Naina, slain must be Or it shall be the worse for thee. I hear, my lord. I haste away To do your bidding without delay. He loves me, he loves me not, He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not... Call mermaids to a clear glade, Tell them a round dance to make. We'll have to lead Ruslan astray And then entice him into the lake. His horse you drug with sleeping grass To make its footsteps falter forlorn. The man shall pay for his defiance. You hear that sound? He blows his horn! In the wisps of pre-dawn fog we're sailing To the backwaters' stillness and gloom. Alluring songs are prevailing On a traveler to come down to his doom. On the sea bottom we make our dance. Come down, the handsome, young stranger. And the blissfully magical trance Of water will swallow you for ages. Oh Ruslan mine, don't me disdain! Dismount and be all mine again! You're lying, witch. Begone I say! Wake up, my steed! Wake up! Away! I'm thirsty! Water! Please! Make haste, Oh tiger, pounce on the man And kill my hated foe Ruslan! Help! Help me! Help me! Help! Help! Kill him! Kill him! Dance and jump, my dear girls! Go, the storm, in howls and whirls! Swirl in round after round, Over the forest, out of bound! Our dances full of fire, Our charms will you inspire! Our caresses you bid no danger! Stay with us, our lovely stranger! You'll forget your dear mate. We will find you a new maid. A black swan, she'll be a catch For which Ludmila is no match! Begone, begone you imps of hell. Forward my steed, and bear me well. Ride on, ride on, But don't you forget Naina swears She'll stop you yet! Here stand I, Ruslan, all alone! No, maid. Call not your love to thee. You're Chernomor's till eternity! Ludmila, speak, give me a sign. Where are you, sweet love of mine? That face, that bearing, that hair... Do I gaze on my Ruslan there? His eyes are dim. He cannot stand, And he's pierced with an arrow... Oh Ruslan! She can't resist! Oh, joy divine That which I coveted! She's mine! Ho, Chernomor! Come out to me! To mortal combat I challenge thee! Now, warrior, your blood shall spill today. Chernomor's might shall overcome and slay! This is no fight, 'tis an embrace. Wizard, that mace of yours, that mace! Ah, listen, knight unto my plea. I'll let you go, I promise thee. Your gallantry and youthful fire I freely confess that I admire. Pay heed, sir, you shall not come to harm... - No, you shall die this day! - Pay heed, good warrior! No, vile worm, You who stole my wife away. Ruslan won't hear your imploring! His sword is pulled, your ploy ignoring. Know, tyrant, that this sword of mine Is fit to trim off that beard of thine! No, warrior, I ask your mercy: I weaken fast, I hardly breathe. Oh spare my life, I'm in your power, And put your sword back in its sheath. Trembling are you, aha! Now is the hour! Abandon, bow down to a Russian's steel! To Ludmila speed to do my will. Now sorcerer, of your beauty shorn My helm these hairs now adorn! Help! Help! Help! Help! Ludmila. Where are you, love? Reply! Don't you hear me? It is I! No trace of her. Nay not a sign. Tears blind my eyes, for her I pine. But wait. My sword is still with me! And while I live, I'll search for thee! Ludmila, where are you, love? Reply! Ludmila's in the summerhouse yet. She sleeps beneath a magic net. I'm here, Ludmila! Your Ruslan. Take courage, knight. Be on your way And bear her back in arms so strong. In those arms of yours she does belong. Take her and cherish her alway. So, Ruslan, you are joyous? Glad? I promise soon you will be sad! My son, go without any waiting, Fly off to the Pechenegs' domain. Pray them to attack, no time wasting. Attack before Ruslan is here again! Halt! - Where speeds that rider in a haste? - Perhaps of wine he had a taste. 'Tis nothing, I warrant, to grieve us. I think that he should leave us. The Tartar's boy I, illustrious Khan From Kiev with a message come. Feel you under my brown Kaftan. It shall talk, though I be dumb. Accept this for your pains, my friend. My doubts have now come to an end. Now is the time. To horse! To horse! To the Russians our swords shall give discourse! The Tartar's young son? In a prisoner's style? You'll pay for your betrayal, traitor vile! You'll pay the cost, you young upstart. No, I keep not motley in my heart! Seize the fool clown, for he does ache To be burned as firewood at the stake! Catch the jester! The twelve fair maidens that me loved I have forsaken in your behalf. I well preferred your warm embraces To their amorous and magic graces. And leaving their merry town, Under protective forest frame I lay my sword and helmet down, Relinquished all my rivals and fame. And now I am, humble and peaceful, In the fisher's hut perched on the shore Enjoying every moment blissful With you, my love, for evermore. Ratmir? In this wild place alone? With a girl? What have you done? What do I see? When often in war Your mighty sword you bravely bore? My comrade, for me all that is past. Of war and combat growing weary My trusty sword from me I cast. This maid and place I love more dearly. Most precious is this girl I hold. Your riches are much more than gold. The ways of war are forgot to me... Even Ludmila's great beauty. Know then that she's here with me. Ludmila's here? How can it be? Did I hear true? Near here is she? Russia's Ludmila I shall see? But where? Oh no, my vows I'd break, My own sweet love is dear to me. For she did this to happen make That I accepted happily. She brought me back to life again Giving me love that I'll retain. That one is happy who is free, Who finds refuge in a cozy shed, Devoid of any care or grief, A cup of good wine in his hand. That one is happy who is merry, With no burden on his mind, To whom the girls their favors carry Who always lushly wine and dine. I, with a beauty pert and hot, Eat, drink, make merry at a joint. The time of life is much too short Not to be thoroughly enjoyed. Now warrior, at last your day's here Just as I made to you my vow. Pull out your weapon, To horse I say, We start to find the princess now. We start to find the princess now. Farlaf, so innocent and guileless, Knight so handsome, valiant, young... Following a witch through a desert pathless! I pray, I pray he return before long! Look there. The coveted prize before you. Kill Ruslan and the lass is won. Fear not. Naina does implore you! One stroke, and the deed is done! One stroke, and the deed is done! Look there. The coveted prize before you. Highness! Do you hear the clamorous shout? A gallant warrior rides to thee Through the golden gates without! I pray you, summon him to me! Ludmila is here! Farlaf, was't thou? That slew her enemy so dire? What spell is this upon her now? - Why stirs she not? - She's sleeping, sire. Sleeping, Farlaf? Deep in a forest where I her found, Far in the heart of Murmansk wild. A Genii guarded your only child. There, by myself, I did him confound. Three days we battled, and the stars Gazed thrice upon our bloody fray. He fell, and then the young princess In my hands I carried sleeping away. But who can break this wizardry? And raise to life my child to me? I know not. That I can't foresee. It seems, and I trust you may agree Our only chance is, wait and see. - Ludmila's sleeping still. - Three days her father fought. To wake her yet it avails nought. Harken, the cymbals clamor, trumpets blow! - The horns as well. - 'Tis strange. Why so? His Highness' will. With their aid Perchance he will awake the maid. Beware! Here come the Pechenegs! They'll drain our blood, and drink the dregs! My Lord! The Pechenegs are here! Their hordes are drawing near! Billows of dust around they raise! - The hills beyond are all ablaze! - The horses gallop thru our fields! - The sun's shining on their shields! - They pitched the tents on our shore! They come. They're here. I can no more! We shall prepare the foe to fight! Ruslan on the plain? Murdered is he? Why no, Naina. We shall see. Before the night has fallen quiet, I shall go help the noble knight. Here have I found, by wisdom led, The water living, and water dead. Great Khan, this battle is ill starred. On every side they press us hard! Bring here oxen, on Kiev send them. We'll use them as a battering ram. The living water, and the dead I'll pour on your body, And upon your head. I pour, Ruslan, that you may go To find Ludmila and rout the foe. Where is Ludmila? Gone is she? Such is the will of destiny! A bloody task awaits you, where Your sword triumphant you shall bear. You shall bring peace to Kiev's shore And with your love shall meet once more. Take you this ring, it has magic grace, Pass it around her head and face, And wake her once again to life. Your foes shall perish in the strife. This kingdom shall once more be free. All will be well, I promise thee. And now, good defender of the poor, Adieu. I may not meet you more. Why, herdsmen, do the oxen stay? Petrified? They must move, I say. Pardon us, Khan! We're fully ready To perish for you, happy and gladly. Your oxen fear the stormy hail Of Russian arrows that them impale. Protect the oxen, and in their stead Send the Russian captives on ahead. Hold! Hold! Before it is too late! It is our wives, our children there, wait! Behold, Oh friends, it is Ruslan! Now is the enemy dead to a man! Approach and see how it is done. I've cut two slices out of one. Goad on the bulls, surround Ruslan! Let him be gored and trampled on! Trampled on! Roar like a tiger, let's hear your roar! Roar louder, roar, Chernomor! Roar louder, with all your might Before I strangle you outright! Invincible Ruslan, warrior bold! Worthy Ludmila as wife to hold! She is alive... Her eyes I can see... Ruslan! My child is now restored to me! Ruslan, you brought'er back to life, She shall again become your wife! Who was it that betrayed and slew me? Mine was the deed. Ruslan, pray mercy! Pardon, Vladimir, this man of nought. Beguiled was I, in sorcery's spell When I did this dastardly deed so fell. Ludmila's hand to obtain I sought. Begone, false knight that I abhor! But I shall give my pardon to thee. I banish you for evermore To the far confines of this country. Begone you knave of no prowess Before the Prince changes his mind. I fain would tan your fat behind And throw you in a pool of cess. Where is the dreadful Chernomor? Without his beard his power is dead. By putting bells and cap on his head We'll make for us one jester more. My friends, let there be feast and song To mark the victory of right over wrong. Then did the Prince in the palace hall Hold a wonderful feast for one and all. An honest tale of bygone days. A legend of heroic ways. Screenplay by A. PTUSHKO with collaboration of S.
