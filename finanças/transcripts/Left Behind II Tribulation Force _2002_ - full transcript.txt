(music) It's been a week since the greatest disaster the world has ever seen. A week since people all around the world simply vanished off the face of the earth. People everywhere are still struggling to come to terms with the reality of what has happened. Actual numbers may not be known for years, but initial estimates are in the hundreds of millions. Even more unbelievable and terrifying is the fact that every child from every country is among the missing. For those of us who have been left behind, we are living in a world of chaos and confusion. Physical devastation is catastrophic and the cleanup process has only just begun. With everything from driverless cars to crashing planes inflicting their destruction across the planet the death toll is sure to be astronomical. But the post disaster cleanup is not the only issue facing over strained governments around the world... Look at this. Young, energetic, honest. And with shock, grief and fear being the dominant emotions, countless numbers are choosing suicide... People trust him. You're right Mr. Secretary General, they do. How many times must I tell you, Nicolae is fine. After all, we are on the same team here. And I want him to join us. The situation is even more serious. My friends, I can only sit here before you now and tell you that for the first time in my career, I honestly don't know what to say or even where to begin. I can only ask each one of you to be strong. This is Buck Williams reporting live from Chicago. Good night and God Bless. Well he's sure managing to hold it together. I don't know how he does it. He told me the secret's not being calm, it's looking calm. At least he's not afraid to say how he feels. (gunshots) Man, you didn't have to kill them! Back off. You know who this is? Oh yeah. They were just kids! Breaking into a van. Gimme a break. Hey, what difference does it make? Look around. Let's get outta here. Oh come on. There is a huge spiritual void out there. It's only natural that people are going to try to return to the ancient symbols of their religion to find answers. You can't just shut down the Wailing Wall. But it's being described as a safety precaution. Yes, yes, the UN did shut down one of the world's holiest sites. But look what happened. Three men were burned to death. Did they have any other choice? But what really happened? How did they die? People don't just burn to death in the middle of the day. And why weren't there any arrests, I mean, all the UN has said was that it was under mysterious circumstances. Now don't we have the right to know more? Mr. Williams, you alright? Yeah, I'm doing good. How 'bout you, Joe? Oh, there's someone waiting for you. A Mr. Steve Plank. Buck Williams. Hey. Hey Steve. You know, for a reporter you're a pretty tough guy to track down. Yeah, well what are you doing here? Listen, Buck, Nicolae Carpathia wants to see you. Really, why? No idea, but he asked me to find you personally. Now you can contact him at the UN. Alright, I'll get to this a little later this afternoon. Now Buck, don't let this thing sit on your desk, okay? I promised him you'd call him right back. I gotta go, you call him. Alright. Okay, now on a slightly different track. What's your reaction to Rabbi Ben-Judah, who's perhaps the world's leading religious scholar, who claims he's going to announce the single biggest piece of news in history. You have now heard all of the delegates. Each representing one of ten permanent members of the security council. Clearly, each of them agrees this world is in need of one thing above all else, and that is leadership. You have also heard them ask you directly to take this mantle upon yourself. But before you make your decision, please, allow our representative from the world monetary fund to make one final appeal. Sir, as you know, almost every currency has crashed completely. There is little doubt that the entire world market could be days from complete collapse. Unless we can consolidate at least the major currencies. But no one is going to allow one single world currency. Perhaps no one would have. But now all of that has changed. You are the one man that the entire world will accept to administer. Mr. Secretary General, what we are looking for at this time is a leader who can unite a shattered world. Please, I ask you, on behalf of every man and woman on the planet, to be that leader. (applause) I am humbled by your trust. If there is no other alternative, I accept. (applause) Now, with control of all currency, we are finally in a position to make peace our only choice. Immediately we will call on every nation to disarm. To put aside all their racial, social, political, and the deadliest of all, their religious differences. Today we must accept this truth. There is no heaven or hell. There is just us. Here, now. Let us not look beyond ourselves, let us look to ourselves. Together we need not fear temptation or evil, for ours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. (applause & cheering) Thank you all for coming. Ray... Ray... Ray, people are missing. Dozens of seats, empty... Captain Steele, please return o the flight deck immediately... Where are my kids? They were sitting right here. Please, we are at 37,000 feet. No one just walked off this airplane. Captain Steele... Ray... Ray... Ray. May you walk in the faith of the Lord. What are you doing? What's it look like I'm doing? You can't take them down, I live here too, you know. Are you listening to me? That's my mother and my brother. Chloe, if you want them, then take them to your room. Fine. (phone ringing) Hello? Hi Bruce. Good, good. Yeah we'll be there. Good, Buck. Hey. The UN just wrapped up another press conference. Nicolae's not wasting any time. The way they're talking, he's not just secretary general of the UN. It's more like he's president of the entire planet. What are we gonna do? The only thing we can do. Work together to share the truth with anyone who will hear it. Now that's a pretty tall order. Everyone in the world thinks Nicolae is some sort of super hero. To convince them that he's a bad guy, that's gonna be- Well how do we stop him? We can't stop him. We can't change the events of the bible. The antichrist will rule. What we have to do is fight him. All of us, together. Form our own tribulation force and spread God's word. Why do I get the feeling that Nicolae's not going to like that idea. Why do I get the feeling that Nicolae's not going to like that idea. The bible makes it clear. The antichrist will hunt down and kill every Christian he can find. Admitting you're a Christian during the tribulation is just like marking yourself for death. You seen those reports about the two men who were burned to death at the Wailing Wall? Yeah. The UN closed it down. See these guys? Who are they? The witnesses. The bible talks about two men who will appear during the tribulation. They will preach God's word, they will lead thousands to salvation. It's a crucial end times prophecy. A lot of people believe they will do their work in Jerusalem, at the Wailing Wall. God gives these men the power to defend themselves with I'm mifire from heaven.ion. Wait a minute, you think the witnesses are here, now? That's what we need to find out. Something made the UN close off that area. You're right. I gotta get over there. Are you crazy? You could get yourself killed. Why can't someone else go? Because I don't trust anybody else to stick to our mission. What can I do? United States government just gave Nicolae a brand new airplane. He needs pilots. And? And you've flown dignitaries plenty of times. You're already ahead of the security clearances. No. No way. Ray- Bruce, we're talking about the antichrist here. He's gonna slaughter millions of innocent people. I won't be a part of that. I'm sorry. Ray! Hear me out, alright? These are not ordinary times. But we can't go back to the way we were. You are asking me to drive Jack the Ripper from door to door so he can kill people. I'm not gonna do that. Ray, none of this is easy. But we have a calling now and we've got to stick together. I am not gonna fly that airplane Bruce, I'm sorry. If you don't somebody else will. Well that's fine, let them, I don't care. Who would you rather in the cockpit? Someone who thinks Nicolae's a god or someone who knows the truth? We need the information to save souls, Ray. Bruce, I'm sorry. I can't believe that you're gonna do this. Hey, Chloe. I'm not gonna let anything happen to me. I promise. How could I? I'd never get to see you again. Will you wait for me? Everything okay? Yeah. What's your plan to get past Nicolae's men in Jerusalem? I plan to get access. My old boss called me. He told me that Nicolae wants to meet with me. Let's not forget who we're dealing with here. How could I? Do you think that Nicolae suspects that you know the truth? It's possible. This could be a trap. Or some kind of test to see if I know who he really is. (gunshot) Don't worry, this will be completely painless. (gunshot) Have you talked to anyone who was there? Yes. And they all swear it was a murder suicide. And if you hadn't accepted Christ, you would too. But Bruce, the UN controls the Wall. Nicolae controls the UN. If I want a shot at getting close to these witnesses, then I need Nicolae on my side. I've gotta meet with him sooner or later. If I don't, he'll get suspicious. Besides, I'm a journalist. What journalist in the world would not give his right arm for a meeting with Nicolae Carpathia? (sirens) We've got a seriously burned fireman here who needs some help! The hospitals are all full, I need a bed! We got a bed right here. I'm gonna have to leave him with you. Gimme a hand here, will ya? Get him off. On my count. On 3-1, 2, 3! Hey. Hey, how you doin'? Good. Ivy, what are you doing here? What, did you think you could get rid of me? Yeah, no. No, this is great! Good. I heard they sent you here and I figured I'd be bored, so here I am. So, what are we working on? Uh, right here. Look at this. I'm trying to figure out what's going on at the Wailing Wall. Mr. Williams. Who gave you clearance to waltz in here and take over this space? Hey Verna, how you doing? It's been a long time. Drop the chit chat and just answer the question. Verna, I'm trying- You may address me as Miss Zee. Look, I don't know what's gotten into you, but I'm working on a special assignment. Special? Who assigned you a special? And you are? I'm Buck's assistant, but you could call me Miss Gold if you like. Gold, huh? Well, I'm in charge here, so let me lay out the ground rules. You will not touch, use, fool with or otherwise employ this equipment unless you have my personal clearance in advance. Furthermore, you will not be involved in the creation, development or broadcast of any specials while you're working here, are we crystal? Listen, let me make something crystal to you, okay? Specials are assigned by New York and as long as I'm here, Look, it's not important, just drop it, okay? It tdoesn't matter.. Is that crystal? We'll see about that. Look, it doesn't even matter. I know the truth about what happened. I know what happened with the vanishings, alright, and that UN line about nuclear radiation's got nothing to do with it. What we saw was the act of God. This was bible proph- Crazy person, okay, you're temporarily insane and I cannot hear you. Just be quiet. Look, we'll work from my place. The first thing I want you to do is call the UN and get me a meeting with Nicolae Carpathia. You know what, this is crazy. I could just go to a hotel or something. I got a mattress in that bedroom- Wow! I got a couch in the other one, you can have your pick. Very nice. Bucky, Bucky, Bucky. Buck Williams hospitality. You gotta love that, huh? Look at this view! Yeah, and when your fiance comes, he can stay here too. Yeah. You're phone is blinking. Very cool. This is me! No one has this number. Hey Buck, it's Steve Plank. Look, I'm glad you came to your senses. Nicolae will be in Chicago in the next day or so, we're just firming up his schedule. We'll get a hold of you when he's got some time, okay? Okay. Ciao bud. Did you give Steve Plank this number? No. I don't know how they found me. Listen, if I'm not here, don't let anyone in, okay? No one. Okay. Hey Ray, he's starting. Oh, I know. I'm just waiting for Chris. There he is. Buddy, how you doing? I'm okay. Hey Chris. Buck, good to see you again. You too. Let's go in. Every person in this room has lost someone. A mother, brother, wife, friend. Ask yourselves this question, did all of these people have anything in common? Yes. Two things. Either they had decided to follow Christ or they were too young to have made that decision in their lives already. So I've got good news for you tonight. We lost our loved ones because of the rapture. The bible told us it was coming, but anyone who believed in Jesus Christ is in heaven right now with God. What's left for us is a second chance. I'm not gonna stand here and tell you that the road ahead is gonna be an easy one folks. How many have heard of the tribulation? The bible predicts that there will be a treaty between Israel and the rest of the world. That treaty will be brokered by a great leader, the signing of that treaty will mark the beginning of a seven year period of darkness. That's what we're talking about when we refer to the tribulation. So what's gonna happen? What's gonna happen? The world will experience judgments. Terrible judgments. Devastating wars, famines, plagues, and those judgments are represented in prophecy by these guys. How many have heard of the four horsemen of the apocalypse? And I looked and behold a white horse. And he who sat on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him and he went out conquering and to conquer. Revelation 6:2. Now who is this first horseman? I believe he represents the antichrist. And his purpose is made clear by the two words, 'to conquer'. Is he gonna kill us all? No. No. Other passages make it clear that he will triumph, not through force, but through diplomacy. Through peace. Through a false peace that promises world unity. Does that sound familiar to anyone? That's what Nicolae Carpathia's trying to do. But Nicolae can't be the devil. All he talks about is peace and harmony. Does he strike you as a liar? How does he strike you? As a savior! As a savior? There's only one person who can save you from your sins. One Messiah. That's Jesus Christ. I'm outta here. These are dangerous times, and we're all afraid. But this book also gives us a second chance. Chris! Come on, man, wait, Chris! I can't sit there and listen to that garbage. What? Save us from sin, Nicolae's the antichrist? Come on! I mean, what is it with you people? You think everyone's bad. Well I have something to tell you. There are lots of good people in the world, including me. According to who's standards? Your's or God's? What? You just said you were a good person. I mean, do you think you've kept the ten commandments? Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I'm not perfect but I've never killed anybody. Okay. Well, have you ever lied? Yeah, well, who hasn't? So what does that make you? Human. Come on Chris, be honest. If you've murdered somebody, that makes you a murderer. So if you've lied, what does that make you? Okay, a liar. Have you ever stolen anything? No. Even if it's something small? Well, yeah, once. So what does that make you? A thief. You know, the one that really got me was, Jesus said, whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. You ever done that? Yeah. Guilty. So Chris, by your own admission, you're a lying thief and an adulterer at heart. And that's only three of the ten commandments. So if God judges you by those standards, do you honestly think you're going to be innocent or guilty? I guess I'd be guilty. Chris, that's the point. So what am I supposed to do? Get religious? That's what we're trying to tell you. Jesus took your punishment when he died on the cross. That's, God did that so you wouldn't have to go to hell. That's how much he loves you. Eternal life is a gift. You don't have to do anything religious. I can't accept that. Aw, Chris. We missed the rapture. We missed the boat. But that doesn't mean it's too late. God calls all men everywhere to repent. Come up here, right now, turn from your sins. Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise God. (music) You lost someone too? Yes, I- (phone ringing) Hello? Yeah, hi Chris. What's-what's going on? Chris. Chris? Chris? What's going on man? Chris, it's me Ray. Get out. Listen, you don't need that. I know what it's like. I lost my wife and my son. Everything. Just like you. It hurts, man, I know that. It hurts more than anything I've ever felt. I miss them terribly. And I can cry or hide or wreck everything in my house, but it is not gonna change anything. They are not coming back. I keep going because I know that they are in heaven, that there is a heaven, that it's real. Real? This room is real. This is real. Chris, why don't you give me that gun. Don't. Not unless you wanna die too. I don't wanna die Chris. I thought I did. I thought I deserved to. But that's not what God wants. God? God is dead. You heard Nicolae. There's no heaven, no hell, there's only us. He wants you to think that there is no reason to go on and he wants you to kill yourself. He wants you to think that there iRight here, right now. nd he wanThat's what he wants.lf. Why? Because you have a purpose. Because God created you and me. Everybody. I mean look around you. Do you think that this was an accident? That the oceans, the sunset, do you think this just happened by chance? What are you saying? I'm saying that there is a God. There has to be. It's the only thing that makes sense. So if there's a God and there's a heaven, why are we here? Why aren't we in heaven? Because we weren't right with God. No. Chris. Chris you can pull that trigger, I can't stop you. But if you do you are never gonna see your wife again. Is that what you want? She's in heaven with my wife and my son. She committed to God and she is in heaven and if she's not, if they're not, then where are they? You tell me, where are they?! You can guarantee me that there's not a heaven? I mean, can you guarantee that 100%? What if you're wrong? You want to be with them, don't you? I know you do. And they want you to be with them. Now you have got to make a decision. It's the biggest decision of your life. Trust me. Trust your wife, Chris. You need to trade that gun for God. You need to put your faith and your trust in God, and you need to do it right now. Now what do you say? Are you ready to make that trade? I just confirmed there were two men preaching when those people got burned at the Wall. Bruce, I think this is real and I think it's happening right now. By turning it into a GNN report. I can tie it to all the talk about that one world religion. I get in there with a camera, I up link to a satellite- Live TV. The world sees the truth on live TV. I love it. Alright guys, but what about UN security though? The Wall's closed. I've got a meeting with Nicolae. Chris just got saved. It was amazing. Amazing. Praise God. I finally got it. I know what God's purpose is for me. I'm going after that pilot job for Nicolae. Ray, last time we talked you told me flat out, no. There's no halfway with the antichrist. Right, you're either in 100%- Bruce, when Nicolae signs that treaty with Israel, the tribulation begins. We don't have much time. You two are both crazy. You want to work for the antichrist and you want to have lunch with him? What makes you think you're even gonna get the job? I've got a connection. Whatever. Hey. Hey. Watcha doing? Nothing. Is that your family? What are these? It means they were church members. Listen, I know that you're concerned about your dad. I do not want to talk about my family. Okay. Chloe, I feel like there's something you're not telling me. I think you're a wonderful guy but I'm having a really hard time with this whole hanging out with the devil thing. I don't even know if you're gonna be alive tomorrow. Hattie. Ray. It's great to see you. What is it Ray? Well, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. For what? Leading me on? I'm over it. I'm on a tight schedule, what can I do for you? I need something. I wanna talk to you. Funny how things change in the blink of an eye. Hattie, I wanna fly this plane. You and every other pilot. A few days ago you were warning me about taking this job. Waving your bible around like you'd gone off the deep end. Everything had just happened. I mean, my world was upside down. I lost my family. I didn't know where to turn. But not to me. Besides Ray, I've heard the little lies. All the rumors. What is it? Oh yes, the antichrist. Isn't that what the bible thumpers are saying? So how can you waltz in here and ask me for this job? Come on Hattie. I'm a pilot, I deal in facts. We've worked together a long time, right? In all that time, did you ever know of me spreading rumors and lies about people? I've been doing a lot of thinking, I mean, I lost almost everything. But I can still fly. I am a good pilot and you know it. I wanna give something, and I believe the best way to do it is if I work for Nicolae. I believe you mean that. I do mean it. I do. You'll have to see him. Once you know him, it's amazing. He's always talking about the greater good and world peace. You know actually, I think he's a Christian. Hey Chloe, come on in. Everything okay? I have to ask you something. Yeah, sure. Come on in, sit down. What do you think about relationships at a time like this? Relationships? What do you mean? Well, romantic ones. Between a man and a woman. You sure you don't want to sit down? I think I know this man. Someone who's leaving very soon. I think the stakes are high everywhere, including in relationships. Maybe God wants you to make a sacrifice Chloe. Maybe God wants you to let Buck go. Even if he never comes back? I think you gotta talk to him. You're right. Thanks. You're right. Thanks. (knocking) We don't want anything. Go awa. I'm looking for Buck Williams. What! What! What? Does Buck Williams live here? Um, no. No he doesn't. Look, what do you want? You want an autograph or something? Is that what you want? Listen chicky, let me give you some advice, okay? You're not the first one to follow him home, so why don't you just skedaddle and go play with some college boys, okay? Bye! (phone ringing) Gonna get that? It's him. Him who? Buck. Buck? What is going on? Nothing? That nothing has a lot of something behind it, Chloe. He's engaged. I bet you didn't know that, Dad. He's living with someone. Come on. Buck is not engaged. Yes he is. I don't know where you get your information, but if Buck were engaged, he woulda told us. (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, Ray. Hey Buck, how you doing? A little frustrated. Is Chloe there? I think we've had some kind of misunderstanding. I'd say that's true. Why? Is she standing right there? Absolutely. Do you have any idea what the problem is? No, not really. Well, I'd like to get to the bottom of it. I'd like to come over tonight. I think that'd be a good idea. Great. You mind if I come over right now? That's a great idea. I'm already on my way. Okay Buck, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Now, I'm going to go take a shower and go to bed. Goodnight. Come with us Mr. Williams. Ah, Mr. Williams. Sorry to meet like this, but I knew you would appreciate the view. Come. Good to see you again. Last time we were together it was under rather unfortunate circumstances. Yes. Yes, that was a terrible thing that happened. Since that day it feels, perhaps, like you've been avoiding me. No, why would I do that? It's just things have been very crazy. I mean everything- Yes, yes, of course. There's a whole world out there looking for answers, Buck. And I'm sure you'll agree that the most important thing right now is seeing they get the right ones. That's why the UN has decided to assume control of the world's major media. What? Sounds like you don't approve. Well, a free press is the cornerstone of a free world. I- Leadership without accountability does not sound very compelling. I want only the best for this world. You've heard enough to know that by now. I have traveled from country to country in the last week, and I can tell you firsthand, I have seen nothing but pain and suffering. It seems that people just weren't built to deal with this kind of overwhelming stress. People have only one natural reaction to something like this. Find someone to blame. It's up to us Buck. If people can't find the answers they are looking for, they only have to make them up. Think of it. A world looking for someone to hate. Turning for answers to a media who makes it's living on feeding rumor and promoting conflict. We may hold the secret to world peace and unity in our hands. Why me? Because people trust you. You're exactly what they need in a time like this. A voice of reason in a world of fear and suspicion. A voice like yours is the most powerful weapon in the fight for peace. And If I refuse? I don't think you can. This is too important. If I do this, I need complete freedom to cover any story I want. Of course. And I want total UN Security clearance. If I'm going to report the truth, I need access to it. Buck Williams, I welcome the accountability. Do we have a deal? Good choice, Buck. Hey Buck. Congratulations. I hear we're gonna be working together. Hey, why didn't you tell me Nicolae controls GNN? Not relevant. Listen, I'm gonna be your man on the ground Nin Israel, anything you need, a be yoyou come to me. round You know, it's gonna be a lot better for guys like us. Journalistic integrity, freedom of the press. Nicolae, he's the boss you always wanted to have. Sure. Yeah listen, I'm going to cover the peace treaty. No no. No, no, no. The Ben-Judah announcement. That's the event, alright, believe me. It'll be the biggest story of your career. Why is this speech so important? Come on, buddy. You're the reporter. You figure it out. See you later. (knocking) What are you doing here? Chloe, I need to talk with you. No. Go away. Chloe, hey. I'm not leaving until you talk with me. Fine. Daddy! Yeah? Buck's here and he won't leave. What do you want me to do? I'm taking a shower. I got soap in my eyes. Get rid of him. He's not here to see me. Great. You have 9 minutes. Could we go inside? No. Okay. We'll just stand out here and freeze. Well, obviously Chloe, there's some kind of misunderstanding. Pretty smart, huh? Chloe, I don't understand. I thought that we sort of hit it off. I mean, I really like you. Me and who else? What? Nothing. You have 8 minutes. Keep talking. What do you mean, me and who else? Chloe, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. You know what, forget it. Why don't you go back to your fiancee before she gets worried. Wh-My what? I met her today at your apartment. Who? Brunette. Bath towel. Big shiny diamond. Ring a bell? Ivy? Mrs. Ivy Williams. Cute. I am not engaged to Ivy. Or anybody else. She's just crashing at my place. She's my assistant. End of story. So she's not- I feel like such an idiot. Hey don't. You know what, it's my fault. I mean, I really should have told you, but I just didn't think that- I'm sorry. Hey, how are my 8 minutes doing? You can have all the time you want. Everything okay? Shower, huh? You knew he was coming. Thanks, Daddy. Goodnight, sweetheart. And I know they're going to have a platoon straight up to Golden Gate. Don't worry, I talked to Nicolae. He's given me full UN clearance. There's a twist. The antichrist approves a story that could reveal what he is to the world. Unless he finds out that you plan to put the witnesses on GNN. Well, I'm going to convince him that everything I'm doing is for the sake of world unity. I'll pray for you, Buck. And I'll be on the ground with you. You need anything at all, I'll be there. Thanks. There's still a lot of what if's. Bruce, I've been praying and I know this is the way to go. Guys, the antichrist has power we may not even be able to comprehend. We walk by faith, not by sight. I am troubled by the developments with the Wailing Wall. Divided religions mean a divided world. These men, these self proclaimed preachers are dangerous. Why don't you just arrest them? I don't want to put them in jail. This is not a dictatorship. I simply do not want to see anyone else get hurt. Increase the guards at the Wall. Are you waiting for something? The Wailing Wall's an important symbol. Thousands of people have flocked to it. Exactly. The world is in shock Mr. Plank. Millions vanished. No rational explanation. People are grasping at straws. It's our duty to give them faith. How, Nicolae? By creating spiritual unity, of course. A one world religion. Tolerance, harmony and peace. How does this create harmony? Yes, Mr. President? Block channel 10. Then give me the Buck Williams Report. Right away, sir. I believe people are finally ready to accept it. A united global society. The world will follow us to peace. And this man will show them the way. Okay, alright, one more. Ugh! How 'bout a silly one. I think there's another one. Okay. (laughing) You feel like a cookie? Why, do I look like one? That was so lame. I know. Here we go, here we go. Let me see. (laughing) I like that one. Look at your face. Yeah, I think I'll keep all of them. Hey! Just kidding. There you go. Thanks. Aww. Well, this is where I say good bye. Hey, you know I have no choice. I know. Listen, we'll still have our pictures, right? Yeah. I'll be thinking of you. That's fine, sir. Thank you. He'll be okay. Watch out for him. You know I will. Be careful, Dad. I'm really proud of you. I love you. I love you too, angel. Are you okay? I think I might get a coffee. Sure. Alright, here we are. Ray. It's me. What are you doing? Trying to see what I can find. Be careful. Excellent. Good work on the speech. Ben-Judah loves the changes. Well, I'm glad to hear that. Come on... Captain Steele. Is there something I can help you with? I was looking for Hattie. I wanted to give her our ETA. Miss Durham speaks very highly of you. She tells me you once worked together. Yes, sir. That's correct. That past relationship, did it extend beyond the workplace? Excuse me? There are hundreds of qualified pilots all over the world. I'd like to think she hired you for the right reasons. No. In reference to your question about our past relationship. No, it didn't extend beyond the workplace. Good. I like to know where everyone stands. Yes, sir. Captain, why don't you give me that. Sorry? Our ETA. I'm about to go see Hattie right now. Of course. Forgive me. I forgot. Captain Steele? Are you okay? I'm fine. Good. This plane, it meets your expectations? Yes, sir. It's amazing. Thank you Captain. And Captain- Glad to have you with us. Thank you sir. Good to be here. (knocking) Hey. Come on in. How'd it go? Find anything? Yeah. I think so. The attachment is Ben-Judah's speech. Okay, okay, here we go. The Messiah will be pierced without breaking a bone. Medical records show that when Nicolae was 6 years of age, he was pierced through the chest by a farm machine without breaking a single bone. The Messiah will travel to Egypt as a young child. This is what Ben-Judah's big announcement is all about. He's gonna announce that Nicolae is the Messiah. That's why Nicolae wants me here. He's using me to promote this speech. No, we're missing something here. If this is Ben-Judah's speech, then why did I hear Nicolae thank Steve Plank for writing it? Or re-writing it. Come on, Ray, Ray look, the Messiah will be pierced without breaking a bone. We all know that was Jesus Christ. He was stabbed when he was hanging on the cross. Ben-Judah was going to announce that Jesus Christ is the Messiah they changed the speech. How are they gonna get Ben-Judah to read it? Nicolae's got a lot of people under his power. We've gotta get to Ben-Judah. And then what? I mean if he has all these people under his power or spell or whatever you want to call it, it's supernatural. What can you do? I can't do anything, but God can. The only thing that's gonna break it is the power of God. But how? We get Ben-Judah face to face with the word of God. Buck- We take him to the witnesses. Buck, good to see you. Steve. Listen, I need a favor. I need to get to the Wailing Wall. Why? The two men at the Wall. Listen, I know they're a problem for Nicolae. I think I can discredit them. I think I can make them go away. Well, I like it. I like it a lot, but I, I can't do it. Not even for you. It's off limits. Steve, come on. No, no. Look, Buck, Nicolae has everyone's best interests at heart. He wants to unify the world, not divide it. The more attention you give those guys, the worse you're gonna make it. This, this right here, Buck, this is where the world is going. One faith for everyone. Oh, Buck. Don't even think about it. Can I read to you? Let not your heart be troubled- Ye who believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions if it were not so, I would have told you. I will go and prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again... (something falls) Sorry. I'll be right back. Look, Buck told me where I could find you, but it kinda looks like you have your hands full, so I'll make it short. I owe you an apology. I guess we both jumped to the wrong conclusions. I'm Ch- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm Chloe. I'm Ivy. So anyway, I'm sorry, I- No problem. You're quite the fierce protectress. I guess we all have our talents. So anyway, you believe in this stuff? Yeah. Yeah I do. Magic formula. It's not magic, it's faith. And you get that from reading the bible? It's not just reading, it's believing. I guess it's like my mom said, faith is a choice and it comes from the heart so you either want to believe it or you don't. Yeah, it's never been a strong point for me. But hey, good luck. Thanks. Hey, sorry about that. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may also be. Excuse me. Rabbi Ben-Judah? Yes. Hi. My name is- Buck Williams. I think the whole world knows who you are. I was wondering if we could talk. What can I do for you? Well, it's about the two men at the Wall. They are dangerous men. Why? They wish to divide the world through religion. This is not right. There is no heaven, no hell, there is only us. We must not allow closed minded religious fanaticism to divide the world any further. But there are many people who believe that these men have something very important to say, and that Nicolae must be hiding something. That's ridiculous. Why would Nicolae do such a thing? But Rabbi, in this world, a tiny rumour like that could spread like wildfire, and there's no telling how many people might believe it. That's why I want you to come to the Wall to speak to them. You are the world's most knowledgable and respected religious scholar. If anyone can discredit these men, it's you. You can question them, and if they stumble for answers, if they contradict themselves, I'll have the whole thing on tape, for the worldwide GNN audience to see. Rabbi, think of it as a gift to Nicolae. He has much more important things to worry about right now than a couple of radicals. Let's expose these men for who they really are. Before they become martyrs for their cause. Nicolae is lucky to have a friend like you. I know this guy. He never quits. I mean, this is the guy who broadcasted from Israel with planes crashing all around him. Exactly why he's with us. People love him. His coverage will help them understand and accept the peace process. He came to me today. He wants access to the Wailing Wall. He wants to discredit the witnesses. If I thought he could. I want 24 hour monitors on all GNN broadcasts. Immediate notification on any footage from the Wailing Wall. Go. An official press release. Do to extremist threats against the Wailing Wall, any and all trespassers will be shot on site. Alright, well, that should keep even Buck Williams away. Hey. How's it going? Hey, it's going great. Good. You ready? Yeah, the equipment's ready, the GNN uplink is good to go, but I still don't know how we're gonna get to the Wailing Wall. Well, God got us this far, He'll take us the rest of the way. You just get Ben-Judah there, let me take care of the rest. Besides, I told Chloe that I'd look out for you. Really? I told her that I'd look out for you. Really? Hey listen, Ray, you know, I really have no idea what you must be feeling, having lost your wife, your son, but I know that Chloe is really worried about you. It's just, well, it's just hard to let go, you know. I'm gonna be alright. Let's pray. God, some things are just so hard to understand and to accept. Please help us to accept your will. And give us the faith and the strength that we need to do what you want us to do. And we thank you that you're in control. We pray in your son's name, amen. Amen. (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, hey it's me. Hey, hey it's me. Hi Buck. It's so good to hear your voice. Are you guys okay? Yeah, yeah. We're fine. Look, it's just starting to get dark over here and I just wanted to say that I miss you. Are you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm still here. Good. I'm still going to the Wailing Wall. Buck, you can't. The UN just announced that tries to approach is gonna be shot on site. Chloe don't worry. God will protect me. Just pray. I did. I asked Him to bring you home. I really miss you. Me too. Take care. Glad you could make it. The sooner we go, the sooner we put an end to their lies. Let's go. Just wait here. Stop. Show me your ID. I'm with GNN. I work for Nicolae Carpathia. No. We have strict orders. No one passes. Give me strength, God. May you walk in the faith of the Lord. Ô "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me..." ô Stop! Stop immediately! Stop! Stop immediately! Stay where you are! Ô ...I once was lost, but now am found... ô Halt! Right now! Ready. Aim. Ô ...was blind but now I see. 'Twas grace that taught ô ô my heart to fear, and grace, my fears... ô (Hebrew) Take heed now for the Lord has chosen thee to... (Hebrew) He said: Take heed now for the Lord- I know, I know. He's speaking in English. You are false prophets, claiming to know the secret to God's kingdom. God will bring every deed into judgment, Ben-Judah, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil. I the Lord search the heart, I test the mind, and will give every man according to his ways and according to the things he has done. I have kept the commandments since my youth. By the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight, but by grace you are saved, through faith, and this is not for yourselves. It is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast. Cut it. I don't understand. We are ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. This is GNN. We are experiencig technical difficulties. Please stand by. Be reconciled to God. God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him, we might become the righteousness of God. For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life. For God did not send His son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. He who believes in the son is not condemned, but He who does not believe is condemned already because He has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. And the name of the son of God? He is the Christ, Jesus. (gunshots) Buck, how'd it go? It was insane. But if I get the witnesses on TV it's the only thing- What? I spoke to Chloe. The broadcast got cut. Nobody saw it. What do you mean? But at least Ben-Judah heard the truth, right? I don't know, he was gone before- What do you mean, you don't know? He was gone before I could talk to him. It's in God's hands now. Hey. It's good to see you back. Thought you could use some food. Thanks. I'm ready. I'm ready. For God. Then tell him. Dear God, I'm so sorry I've sinned against you. Please forgive me. I want to do the right thing. Jesus, thank you. Thank you for dying for me. I put my life in your hands. I put my life in your hands. (crying) Shh... You were so great. You did good. Did you see his eyes? He had so much peace in his eyes. He found God. Yeah. He did. I regret that I could not be present for this long awaited announcement. Rabbi Ben-Judah, whom I have just recently met, is recognized as the world's leading authority on rabbinical teachings and ancient scriptures. He is known as an honest man. A careful man. A man who supports every conclusion with well researched data. He will be joining you in approximately 1 hour. Unfortunately, pressing UN business calls me back to New York, so I will leave you now. I wish you peace. (cheering) (phone rings) Hello? Buck. Ray. Ray, where are you? I'm on the plane. Nicolae's leaving. Yeah, I know, I just heard. Listen, I'm gonna do all I can from this end, you take care of yourself. Thanks. God bless. I appreciate what you tried to do for me at the Wailing Wall. Don't you worry. This is the real reason why you're here. I'm sure you'll find this announcement fascinating. Be back in a bit. You good? Yeah. Sure. Ready for the broadcast? Please. Here we go. And, after years of study, my team has concluded, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the identity of the Messiah. The bible has given clear prophecies that could be fulfilled by only one person in the entire human race. Based on 456 messianic passages and 558 references from the most ancient rabbinical writings, there are 109 distinct prophecies that the Messiah must fulfill. Perhaps you will be relieved to know that I will not detail all 109 this evening. The possibility that even 20 of these 109 prophecies be fulfilled in one man is well over one in a hundred million. Now, in light of recent world events, there has been much speculation that the Messiah does indeed walk among us today. So let us look at the prophecies. Some of them could apply to any of us. For example, the Messiah will be preceded by a forerunner. He, and the prophecies do refer to a man, will be pierced without breaking a bone. Then it starts to narrow. The Messiah must be born of an extremely rare bloodline. He will travel to Egypt as a young child. He will be rejected by his own people. The Messiah must be born in Bethlehem. The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend for 30 pieces of silver. And perhaps most amazingly, the Messiah- We don't have a connection. To be buried with the rich- Get me a cell phone. NOW! -and of all things, to be resurrected again. There is only one person in history who fulfills all of these prophecies. And his name is Jesus Christ. Of these prophecies. And his name is Jesus Christ. Praise God! -to take them to heaven... Thank you, Buck. I did not believe, but I have seen God's witnesses, and I have heard the truth. Let me beg you, each of you, to open your eyes, to see the truth and turn to God's faith. Please forgive me. He has sent us a savior- I need you. Jesus Christ. Please forgive me for doubting. Cut it. Cut it now! This is GNN. We are experiencig technical difficulties. Please stand by. Pray with me. I accept you, Jesus, into my life... I accept you, Jesus... Into my life- into my life... And my heart. And my heart. And I ask you to stay with me forever. And I ask you to stay with me forever... Amen. (shouting) I don't know if you're gonna be safe here. I will be fine. Thanks, Buck. Thanks to you, millions have heard the truth. I will be fine. Thanks, Buck. Thanks to you, millions have heard the truth. Thanks to God. Feel like taking a break? Yeah. Thank you, God. Thank you. Nicolae, can I get you anything? Leave. Nicolae- LEAVE! Leave me alone. This is not the end! This is my time. MY will be done! I will rule. Ô Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder, ô ô consider all the works thy hands have made ô ô I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, ô ô thy heart throughout the universe displayed. ô ô Then sings my soul, my saviour, God to thee, ô ô How great thou art, how great thou art. ô ô Then sings my soul, my savior, God to thee, ô ô How great thou art, how great thou art. ô ô Then sings my soul, my savior, God to thee, ô ô How great thou art, how great thou art. ô ô Then sings my soul, my savior, God to thee, ô ô How great thou art, how great thou art. ô
