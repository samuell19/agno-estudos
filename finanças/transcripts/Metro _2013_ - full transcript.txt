What should I tell him? Nothing. He already knows anyway. You should leave him. Easy for you to say. Andrieju Borisovich, we have an emergency. Tilt his head. Did he take any medications? - Any drugs? - Of course not! - Is he allergic to anything? - No, nothing. I found him in the kitchen, foaming at the mouth. The Paramedics were not able to do anything. - Endoscope, quickly. - The lamp is damaged though. Help me straighten him. It is stuck. I can't see anything. Clamp! Here is something. Breathe. Breathe, breathe! What's your name? - My name is Gena. - Gena? Your mother taught you not to chew, Gena? It was in the soup. - Vlad... - Well, what are you waiting for? What's going on? Ksenia is home alone for the first time. Not the first time, and there is nothing wrong with that. Sit. Sit. - Tomorrow morning we tell him. - What do you mean "we"? She has a father who loves her. I have to go. Andrieju Borisovich? What are you doing here? Please do not come here. - I just wanted to say thank you. - No problem. - Please go. - Without your help.. my son! Here dispatcher Klokov. Good morning! Here electrician Shevchenko, hello everyone! Sorry I'm late. Sergejevicz! Your working overtime? Your shift is already over. Valery Petrovich, there is a problem. There is water in the tunnel. Probably groundwater, coming from beneath. - It rained yesterday, right? - Exactly. The water level is normal. The drainage system is not half full. This water can't be good. Something is wrong. We need to do something. Yes, Sergejevicz. Your shift is over. Go home. A strange thing though, that you're sober. This water... could it be vodka? Or beer? Stop it! No need to be rude. I spend the whole night in the tunnel. Sorry, Sergejevicz. No offense. Thank you for your information and concern. "Suit yourself". Go on, go home. Goodbye. "If a collision with another train is inevitable the driver can not leave his position and must do everything to avoid it." Right. 1, 2, 3. Test. All good. Alexiej Petrovich. What do you know about the bunkers? I know you think that one is in the subway! No, no. There is an old war bunker at the Culture Park station. Hello, Sergejevicz. Did you hear that? 50 years ago, my father helped build Culture Park... ... and he never mentioned anything about a bunker. That's because it is a military secret. I'm surprised, you've worked here for over 15 years and never seen it? How can you explain, no ventilation shaft at Borodinskaïa? It was covered with concrete, as like in all the other stations. And what about all those hot water pipes? I'll tell you one thing. There is water in the tunnel, "Water leakage". There should be no water. Dad, there is no water. Where's Mom? Put you're shoes on. I saw on the internet, her plane landed yesterday. Go and brush your teeth. It is cold. So, have you chosen? Vodka Putinka. Why all this water? Whatever. Why didn't mom call? She did the same last time. Did she say where she was going? Again candy... Can't your patients give you sandwiches? I'll make you a sandwich. I'll do it. Can you take me to school? I just got home. Mom is not here. Now I have to take the subway. Dad, where is mom? I do not know where your mother is! Have you eaten? Thank you. It was very good. What is this? A gift. Hey, your blocking me in. I have to go. Two minutes please. There is no water in the whole district. - It's a real nuisance. - Hey, young man! When will I see you again? On your next business trip. Or when you finish work a little early. For an hour or two... - Irina, you hear me? - Vlad, do not rush me. I have to think about certain things. - What kind of things? - All kinds. You had a whole year to think about it. Call him and tell him to come down. I do not know where he lives. Dad, this could only happen to you! Stop it! Princess! Vlad, please... Give me another week. On Monday I make a decision. And this Thursday I'm not working. Stop! Let's tell him. - Please, not now... - Let's go! If you don't, I'll do it myself. Right.. They're not here. From the great Andriej... Let me guess. - Flowers every day for the last 12 years. - There for him. - From you? - From his patients. Andriej is a great surgeon. A great surgeon in a public hospital. Fantastic! - What is he doing exactly? - It does not concern you. Well, I'm going. I will not miss my tenders because of this melodrama. Yes, it would be a shame. Come on, disappear. Go to your bidding. Love me tender, love me sweet... - Get going. - I'm leaving. But I'll be back. How do I get out of this mess? You idiot, you should have a donkey, not a bloody car! I'm on my way, I'm coming! I'll be there. - Hey, watch it! - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Now we're friends. Sorry, try with another. Everyone has his own destiny and especially its poison. I am Galina, you can call me Galochka. Sergejevicz. You smell that? Smells like mud! Bravo. Mud! That's what it is, the smell of fish and mud! What's gotten into you? It was not the rain, but river water. From the river! Good day! Hello, bye. Something wrong? Drinking in a public place is prohibited. Drinking, who? My eyes don't lie. Remember Chernobyl? I was a nurse there. I have alcohol-dependent diabetes. She's running away! Out of the way! - Come here! - Go, go... Bitch! Do not run on the Metro escalators! It's prohibited. - Can I charge my phone here? - No. I'm sorry, but you can't buy truffles or a yacht here either. Excuse me. Are you crazy or what? - I'm so sorry! - ... Asshole! Can I call someone? Yes, your lawyer. No, my boss. You said you were out of work. Have you lied to a police officer? - Sit down. - Thank you. Sorry. Number 42! Bon Appétit, Boris! What I eat too loud? Everyone complains about the banana peels you leave behind. Nonsense! They are just jealous of my body. Have you heard of quicksand? You're right in it, Grandpa. Sign here. I have to call my boss. I work in the subway. - In the name of God! - Talk to him if you like. Cute dog. - What's his name? - Tyavka. Tyavka. Tyavka. - Do you want to buy one? - Buy one yourself. IDIOT Be a little more careful, will you! Sorry. You do not know how lucky you are. I am a rare kind of professional, ... A specialist, you might say. I have already noticed that. - A flirty one? - No, a guide. I make tours between Sadovaya subway and Culture Park daily. Your attention, please! Ladies and gentlemen, our train is approaching the legendary station "Borodinskaï", built in 1948. This is a secret part of the metro. This station leads directly, to Stalin dacha... Thank you. In 1950, work resumed at the station, to integrate it with the first line of the Moscow Metro. This station is now closed, because it was built in an unstable area. Directly above the station "Borodinskaïa" is the bed of the Moscow River. This station has no stop. Drivers achieve maximum speed here. It can only be seen in the light of an oncoming train! You now have the opportunity, to see this ghost station! Here, quickly look. I haven't touched meat in 6 months now.. What no, kebabs and vodka? ... God I miss a kebab.. Dad... Oh, Mother of God! Move over. What the?! Get off me! Oh God! Holy Mary! Ksenia. Ksenia! What do you want? Ksenia! What has happened? An explosion? - Are you a doctor? - No! Come on, follow me! Go on, get out! Natasha! Are you okay? Can you walk? We have to get out of here. My bag... Get up! Come on, get up! Get up! I have a sore arm! Come on, get up! What are you doing? Come on, get up! Ksenia... Out of the way! What are you doing? Stop it! Have you lost your mind? You, son of a... Mommy, is daddy...? Do not touch her! Ksenia? - Dad. - Do not move. - Can you hear me? - Yes. Move your fingers and toes. Does it hurt? - No. - Good. Well, take a deep breath. Does It hurt? Come on. Come on, get up. Straighten up. Come on, come on. Are you dizzy? Okay. What has happened? Easy, relax! The train has stopped. I want mommy. I know. You? Yeah. The person you are trying to reach is... Number 42 has stopped in the tunnel? Number 42! Number 42, Control here! Number 42, can you hear me? Klokov what happened between Borodino and the Park of Culture? The 42 has stopped in the tunnel. I can't reach him. What the hell?! Valery? All three pumps are operating at full capacity. Number 42! Boris! Why does he not answer? Apparently he went to the rear wagon, to turn around... Water in the tunnel. - Turn off the voltage rails! - How can he get out then? When he comes back we ask him what was wrong. Number 42! Answer! What happened to the 42? Someone must have pulled the emergency brake. Number 17. Go ahead control. Go to the back of the wagon and turn back to station Sadovaja. Copy that. Turning back to station Sadovaja. - Alexieju Petrovich... - What? Look. Control, we can see water here. I know, I know. Exit the tunnel quickly, we will have to cut the power. - Over and out! - Roger that! - You have the key? - I forgot. Do you hear that? Come, quick! What's going on? Hey, open up! Quick! Idiot! What are you waiting for? Run! Do not rush me! Number 17 is in position, ready to go! Go ahead. - They're going in the wrong direction. - Fools! Calm down, calm down. It will be over soon. I would not recommend that. Why not? Do you see the light. The rails are still powered. But what will happen to them? Maybe they will get lucky. - We need to warn them. - No! What happened to your arm? - Come here. It's broken, you need a splint. - Give me your tie. - Why did I have to break my arm? I can't stop working. I have a lot of things to do. I can't loosen the knot, I always struggles with these damn things. My wife always helps me, with my necktie. Does your wife also tie your necktie? Yes, she does.. She always says that without her.. ... I would hang myself, trying to tie it. That is her way of joking. I married a wife with a sense of humor. Your wife, she's got a sense of humor too.. Yes, she does. - Good morning. - Hello. What is this? 4 shampoos, 2 scrubs and a baby cream. Minimum 30% of discount on a million units. It's his own fault. What? I'm leaving my husband, that's all. - Are you a doctor? - Yes. That's great. - What's your name? - Andriej. I am Mikhail. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry to interrupt you two sweethearts, but I'm afraid we have to go now. "Sweethearts" Come on, let's go. Mom, Is the train damaged? What are you guy's doing in there? Let us out! - Do we have brakes, with all this water. - We'll go slowly. What a mess! Shevchenko! Shevchenko! With the arrival of number 17, you cut the power. Understood. It's hard to imagine what's going on there... We've got a bloody crisis on our hand here, young man! Klokov, where is number 17? He has turned around, and on his way. Stand by for my signal. Be ready! Number 17, why are you so slow? There's a lot of water here! What the hell happend now? I can not breathe! I can't breathe! Let me out of here! Mom, are we all gonna die? Number 17... move slowly. - Go ahead. - Roger that. I hope that no one is in the tunnel.. ...Otherwise they all get electrocuted. Open the doors! - We have to reassure the passengers. - But how? Follow the instructions! Dear passengers, for technical reasons the train is returning.. - ... to the station Sadovaja. - Great! Nearly there, another 100 meters. Accelerate. 90. 80. 70. 60. 50. Very good. 40. 30. 20. Faster! It's dry here! 10! Shevchenko? Shevchenko, did you cut the power on the rails? Yes. So why the hell are the emergency lights flashing then? I do not know. Don't push! Move away from the entrance! "And you are worried about a bunker" Is it this one? This is crazy! I think we should go? Just a moment... We should get out now. Let's go. I... ... need my... ... bag. Is that the one? Just wait. Here! Nice dog... Nice doggie... Good boy... What are you doing? Calm down! Calm down! Do not panic. Come here! Come here! Come here! Here he is! They cut off the power, we can go now. This dog is like " Laika" ... the first dog in space. Yes, sorry for what I did.. ... but it will help us get out of the tunnel. Dad, I can't go to school today? We'll see. So you gonna tell your husband about your affair, this weekend? Where's the invoice for the shampoo? On your desk. I don't have it. I asked them to send it to me by e-mail. Maybe you took it home. Here it is! I can not stand this life of "Santa Barbara". Do you think he knows nothing? He knows and is in pain. But he dares not do say or do anything about it. He remains silent instead. Silent as the grave. I cannot stand it. Not the tracks. If the train moves, we're dead. So what do we do then? We must move from car to car. Grab the railing. No, it doesn't work. I didn't budge. I've got an idea. Hold on to me. Again, again! It's not working... I'm stuck. You have to go. Please go! Go alone. I'll catch up. The wagons will move, and I'll catch up. Go! Go! Get out of here! Come on, try again! I'm not going alone! Can I have your phone number now then? "But I don't talk to strangers". Dear passengers... For technical reasons, the station is closed. Please leave the station in an orderly fashion. The Sadovaja subways are temporarily suspended. Please leave the station. I'm gonna be late for work. Can I get a document justifying the delay for my boss. Exit the station immediately! I'm not leaving here until you give me, your name and badge number! Your attention, dear passengers. For technical reasons, The Sadovaja metros are temporarily suspended. Help me, please! Take my child! There's a lot of water in the tunnel! - It's full of water! - Dear passengers, All trains are suspended. Please leave the station. We have a dangerous situation between Sadovaya and Culture Park. People are in panic and running! - What is it? - We have a situation. Oh, my god. Attention, order of the technical services underground. Close all the watertight doors of the Culture Park station. Close all the watertight doors of the Kiev station. For the watertight doors at the Sadovaja stations, Please wait for instructions, until further notice. I repeat: This situation remains the same until further notice. All traffic in Moscow has come to a complete standstill, because of this incident. Of the 18 rescue units sent to Sadovaja only 6 arrived at the station. And we have sent a helicopter... But it is not enough. - Do you mind? - Please sit. Our department is doing everything in his power. But all roads to the city center are being blocked. And remember, it's Friday. The situation is complex. The Metro is paralyzed. The whole city is gridlocked. ETA for the first emergency services to the scene... ... at least 3 hours away. Minimum. Alexander Nikolaevich. How much time do we have? The situation is unpredictable. The metro blocked in the tunnel, could act like a cork and slow down the flow of water. But it may collapse at any time. Then the huge mass of water rushes into the tunnel. The ring system will be flooded in 3 minutes. In the worst case scenario, we lose the entire metro tunnel system.. ... in under 10 minutes. What a mess! Your infrastructure is poorly executed, Alexander Nikolayevich! Half of the city can collapse! "Half the city!" It's not our fault that in the area are too many buildings erected. As a result of the pressure increase.. ... causing an interruption with the groundwater flow. And the subway tunnels date back to 1935. They were never gonna hold. Hopefully this leak is an isolated case. - What do you suggest? - There is a Emergency evacuation Plan. Phase 1: Evacuate all. Phase 2: Locate and repair the damage. What does that mean, "locate and repair"? What do you do, specifically? The recovery process of the city is our priority. I've made a decision, based on your knowledge, recommendation and evacuation Plan. It's time to move on to phase two. I'm not sure if were in the right place... That's your job! - It is the right place. - thank your lucky stars. Here, quick! Shoot it! Get this guy! - Film the police. - Where? There are dead bodies everywhere. I'm alive! Oh, over there! - There! - Stop it! Over there. Where is my mom? - Turn it off. - Why? We are TV journalists. Behind the fence please. If we need you, we'll call you. - Let's go. - Wait a moment. Come on, commander... Something you don't understand? Why are you smiling? Huh, why? Now we have nothing.. What do you call this then. This is the key to fame, Nazimov. I swapped the hard drives, when he was not looking. That idiot only got the last two shots. but the rest is here. Sergej, you're better than David Copperfield. - This is true. - Many thanks! Time to get on-air, and tell the public. Of course. Strange... - Andriej is unreachable. - Call Ksenia. - She's at school. - And he's, in the subway. There's only two stops, he should be out of the subway now. That's true. he could be anywhere then. Give me your hand. I can handle it. Oh God, there are so many bodies... - You got a phone? - Yes. Mine has a flat battery. Does it work? No network. Something got me! Let go of my leg! Shut up! In the name of God... what happened? - Do you have a phone? - No, I... ... I left it in my jacket. - I'm sorry. - And I have no credit. Wonderful... Where can he be? I envy you, ...you really live life to the fullest. Sleeping with one, and making calls to another... They both love you and want to have your babies. Are you kidding me? Why? In fact, I'm jealous. Very funny. This is good, I'll get there. This is the last wagon. Great. When we come back, you can tell all to mum. Ksenia! Your ready? Mikhail, after you! I don't know how to swim. You do not have to swim, the water is only knee-deep. Nevertheless, I can't. Well, those who do not wish to go, can stay here. Wait, what do you mean by that? I told you that I want, but I can't! "I want, but I can't". What a guy! Do not talk to me like that! I'll say what I want! My boyfriend is like him, that's why I left him this morning. Get going. Wait... I was not scared at all! It's like a water theme park, it turns fear into fun.. Believe me, it will be lots of fun. Ksenia, don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid. - Good. Why did I have to go to Kiev? - Are you angry? - No. - You're having a bad day? - My day is going well. Did you guys see this? - The picture is bad! - Don't bother about that! Give me 2 minutes, and I tell you.. An incident took place between Culture Park station... There is always something. More than a hundred people were injured. The fate of many others remain unknown. At 8:15 the line was closed. We were in the last car, when suddenly there was an accident. But I can not find Lydia. That's is my wife, we got separated. I can only Imagine the pain and emotions your feeling. Could you describe what happened in the tunnel? Total chaos. My God, no... Irina, do you know someone in the subway? After stopping all metro traffic at 8:20, the passengers began to leave the station Sadovaja. Frightened and wounded, some seeking medical attention. Hello. - Hello! - Yes, who's speaking? Svetlana Vladimirovna. The mother of Ksenia Garin. Could you tell me... if Ksenia came to school today? - Can you hear me? - Yes, I can.. Ksenia... is not here yet, but don't worry, I'll call you as soon as she arrives. Our team has captured these images near the scene of the incident. Where is my mom? - Oh my God, No! - Irina! This can't be happening.. - I didn't want this! - Irina... - Please never! - What's going on, where's Ksenia?... My little baby... - I'm alive! - Oh, my God! - Tell me what's going on.. - She never got to school! Don't you understand? I never asked for this! Irina, wait! where are you going? - Vlad is out of reach too. - Irina, please... Let go! Vlad will help me. He ​​has contacts everywhere. According to the rescue operation official, Anatoly Tsyganok.. ... valuable time is lost because of the city traffic. With every minute, the water level rises. The chances of finding survivors are almost zero. The number of victims is hard to estimate at this point, Rescue operations started the recovery of the bodies... The real cause of the tunnel incident... the Moscow river... Just look where you're going! We ask all motorists... ...to make room for the ambulances and rescue teams coming through traffic. The fate of the victims is in your hands. Sergei Nazimov, RTV News. Good? I wonder who that is. The Mayor? No, this is not the mayor. Pity. Don't worry, the Mayor will eventually come.. After brunch! The watertight gates remain open at this point. Alexander Nikolayevich. That's the 18th unit.. which I have told you about. Do we know how many people were down there? Not yet, it was rush hour. We will make a list with the names of the missing. I'm chief Burov. Captain Seliverstov, of the 18th unit. I'm Lieutenant Titov. Lozitski. I am a civilian doctor. - I have heard that you are the best. - That's right. Your task is to get as close as possible, to the scene of the accident, identify the surviving passengers, treat the wounded and evacuate them. Anyone alive must leave that tunnel, as quickly as possible. Everything goes through me. Do you understand? - Yes sir. - Good luck. Everyone ready? Let's go. Seliverstov! Yes sir. As instructions indicates... ... we should have already closed the water tight doors. The tunnel may collapse at any time. We can do this. Just making sure we understand our orders right? When Tanya got pregnant, we were full of joy and got a baby son. - Dad, I'm cold. - Be strong, Ksenia. - Here. - Thank you. That's a Haute Couture jacket. Boys should love their mother... And little girls, well.. ... their father. - And if you only love your grandfather? - Your grandfather, huh.. Besides all that, I only like my dad. This is your dog? Yes. Daddy, who's that? Do you know him? Yes, that's... - Wait! - Hold on! Come on, faster! - What was that? - I don't know. The water is lifting the wagons. Oh my God, what a nightmare! Well.. you can pee your pants if you want, they're soaked already. - Stop it! - Toughen up Princess! Well, now you'll have to marry me. Marry him, will you. - Wait for me. - Come on! Don't fall behind! Come on! My parents taught me to swim the hard way, they pushed me into the deep end. They reckoned my instincts would take over, and kick in, but I have no survival instincts. I am not an animal, I am a human being.. And ever since, I'm terrified of water. - Have you been back in Moscow long? - About 6 months. - You've been away what... 10 years? - 12. I am sure you had a good time. What's your favorite ice cream flavor? You think of ice cream at a time like this?! Why are you like this, I'm just trying to have a friendly chat. Good morning. Hello. - What do you do? - I'm in construction. Tendering for new projects in the city. Is there still a lot of land left to build? If you're willing to pay the price. You're married? I have one child Ksenia with my wife, Irina. Do you remember the blonde from college? Don't you remember? Come on, kids! We have to hurry! pick up your slack! What now! Now we're engaged. Stop wasting your time. You could only dream about marrying a girl like me. I've never been married and not going too either. - Got it? - I can see why. What? Your all right, princess? I'm not your "princess". Step out and see what you've done. - That was a new car. - Asshole! I'm an asshole! The asshole is the one that gave you a license! Hey wait! Who will pay for all this? Another woman who runs off... Story of my life. Dad, I'm hungry. Yes, Ksenia... Galina.. ... could you help me open my briefcase. - Press these buttons here. - These ones? Yes, open it, I have some sandwiches in here. Be careful with the documents! - Close the case please. - Nobody cares about your stupid documents. Well sooner or later, we're getting out of here. And life goes on. If that happens, we'll celebrate. Look what I got. - Say thank you. - Thank you. Your welcome. Give it back! What a little mongrel! Do you believe that? This is delicious! My wife Tanya made them. I'm often on the road, I am a courier. I don't have much time for regular meals. All I eat is junk food. Tanya says it is bad for me. I suffer from gastritis and carefully watch what I eat. Stop it! I've had gastritis since I was little, even then I wasn't allowed fast food. My mum always made me sandwiches and soup to take to school. I was the only kid who brought food to school. Shut up for a moment. Let's go! Quick! Get out of here. Dad, save Tyavka! I'll buy you another one! - Shut the hell up! - Idiot! - Over here! - No, over here! What are you waiting for? Come in here! - Where are we going? - In there! Hurry! - Don't just stand there... - Mikhail! - Come here... - Come on! We have to go to the end of the tunnel! You're going the wrong way! Come here, Mikhail! Come here! This is not a fun water park, stupid! - Think about your wife! - Oh my God... - Come on! - Mikhail! Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid... God why? I see nothing. Does anyone see anything? Can anyone see? - What is it? - It's just rats. I've had a pet rat for 3 years. It knew it's name and the train schedules. - Say what? - Suburban trains. I lived in a house, near the tracks. When I moved in, he was already there. He loved cat food. This bloody place is pitch black... - Shut up! - Okay! All of you, please be quiet! - Ksenia, where are you? - I'm here. - Don't worry, princess. - Dad? Ksenia, I'm here. What was the name of your rat? Murka. Where'd you get that? Dad I told you, mom gave this to me. Do you like it? Your's? Yes. According to an unofficial source, the leak has not been located. The Moscow authorities ordered the watertight doors shut, throughout the subway network for safety reasons. At the present moment, only the gates at the Sadovaja station are open, to allow rescue teams access to the tunnel. But so far they have failed to reach, the epicenter of the accident. A government official, who wished to remain anonymous.. ...said, if the gates at the station Sadovaja stay open, it could flood the entire city center. - Move your car! - Fuck off idiot! Watch where you're going! Dad. Ksenia, stay close to me. - It looks stuck... - Get back! Dad, you're sitting in water. Dad, she looks sick. I have some allergies. What does she have, Dad? Probably a allergic reaction to the subway. - Dad, let's go. - Wait a minute... - Wait here. - I'm going with you. - Just wait here. - What's the hold up, Romeo. Let's go. Watch that damn Dog! Tyavka! Tyavka! Ksenia, do not go without me. Princess, shed some light here. Dad, there is a door! - I wonder what's behind that door? - Maybe a second door. What would be the point then. - You got to have faith. - Shine some light down here. No, I want to help. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on! Dad? Come here. I told you to stay close to me. It does not budge. Anyone interested in getting out? Ksenia! Come here. I told you to stay with me! Do you understand? Hey, anyone up there? Mom! Help us! Is someone there? - Dad, we'll get out of here? - I hope so. Yes, I promise very soon now. It still works. You got a signal? There is no coverage. - Maybe I should be higher. - But how? - Can you get any higher! - No, the grid blocks. No. No. - Nothing! - We must break the grid loose. - Can you get to it. - Grab it and hold on! One of the bolts is loose, if you removed the bolt, it could release. We could use a ladder or something. A crane would be better, but let's find something. Come on. - Here. - Dad, I'm coming with you. Ksenia, wait here. Dad? Out of the way! Sorry, but my husband and daughter are in there. Do you have any information at all? In the tunnel there is none left, - and the wounded got taken to the hospitals. - Which hospital? Several, they have the information over there. - Please check out the lists. - My son is there! - I've already checked it. - The list is updated every hour. Are they still alive? Can you tell me? I do not have that information. Why not? I really do not know. What are you waiting for? I really do care about them, you know? You son of a bitch... This looks like an old military bunker, let's hope someone knows. Someone knows it's here. Maybe that someone will send help. Do you know where your fans are now? At home, watching the news. Any more survivors? There were a lot of people on the metro. Have you found a man named Nikolai Kirsanov? He phoned me, I know he's there. I can not tell you anything. My son is there, he's only 12 years old. - I'll pay you... - I cannot do anything! I lost one son already, your age. Damn bolt... Strike under the nut! Come on, come on! Will the water rise any higher? Upto the river level. "The principle of communicating vessels." Chemistry and Physics 6th grade of primary school. - Have you been studying this? - No. You will. Are we lower than the river in here? Probably two meters below. Now doctor, don't hide your diagnosis. The water will rise at least 7 meters, my friends. High above the grill! We should have listened to Mikhail. He was a courier, he ​​had a sense of direction! He's probably already on the surface... Tanya must be in the process of drying his documents. You just keep on talking and talking... "Documents"... Why is this happening to me? It's loose! Girls, step aside! Come on, Dad! Put your back into it! Come on, guys! It looks like you need help, sweetheart. Thanks, but don't worry about me. Dad! Are you hurt? It's nothing princess, compared to marriage. - Well? - Still no network. This is weird. Did your phone ever work? Have you used it before? Give it to me. You said give it to me! Yes, I said give it to me.. Not throw it! This isn't the moment to forgive each other. But this was our last chance! Who do you want to call? Galina Dergach, representative national handball coach. If they would not have fired me, and my team in 1993... The Germans would never have won the World Cup! The metro passes here without a stop. - Where are we? - Borodinskaïa Station. - What you leaning on? - A watertight door. Lockable in the event of a flooding just like a submarine. - I have never worked on a submarine... - Why don't you lead on. - I can't feel my legs... - The 18th here, do you receive... Command here. We're at mark 235, near the Borodinskaïa station. At the watertight gate we found a unconscious man. Copy that. I'm sending a team over. Roger, over. Sanya, wait for them here, you'll go back with them. - That's an order. - Ivanic? That's all, let's go. Don't worry, we'll see you later. What? Again? Good God, no! When did you use your inhaler for the last time. Where was it? Downstairs, at the bottom of the stairs. Is your lamp waterproof? Yes, this is the best, it works in the water. What are you planning/ You've lost your mind. I feel better already.. I just need a moment... Take a couple of deep breaths! Alright. Why don't we see the light no more? Take it easy, baby. Come on. - A lighter! - What? Light it! It's wet. What's your name? Alisa. Denis. I got kicked out of college. I'm a waiter, I hope you don't mind. Do you? The list of the victims has just been released. There are many wounded... Take 2. Yes, I'll wait. Do not touch! Hello, have you admitted Andrey Garin and his daughter? Her name is Ksenia. - Please calm down! - When can I call back? The list get's continually updated and, many families of the injured have been send to the Moscow hospitals, - where the injured are... Damn! - Again! Again. Unit 18, how's your situation? - Standing in water! - Where are you? Just passed station Borodino and we are approaching Park Culture. Turn around, the situation is getting critical. But we have not reached the accident site yet! We want to continue, over and out. Bloody amateurs! Enough. Dad, were floating to the top. We got a signal! Do not move! Hold on! Be quiet. They are still unconscious and can't recall the course of events. Any good? Super. I already called there! Hello! Andriej. Irina? Andriej, where are you? We are in a bunker! Is Ksenia with you? Andriej, can you hear me? Damn! Where are you? We took a side entrance of the Borodinskaïa tunnel. Do you understand me? Yes. I don't understand... who is this? - Vlad, is that you? - Yes, it's me! Where are Andriej and Ksenia? Ksenia is with me. Why are you calling? Where is Andriej? Let me explain. We are in a bunker, hurry up! - Bloody idiot! - Do not shout! We're gonna die here! I don't exist, right. You've been invisible for a long time. I believe, you were close to the accident. Yes. How far, would you say? Approximately 400 meters. - Did you notice anything strange? - Yes, the red light. I received a call, they are in a bunker! - There are still survivors! - Let me through. Why won't you listen to me?! Let go off me. You said something about a bunker? Bunker. Yes, near the Borodinskaïa station. Let us through. Goddammit! - Hold on, Princess. - Why can't you hear us, idiots! I don't know any prayers. This made me miss the auction. This woman has important information. We need to contact the command center. Let us through. The commander is a little busy at the moment. My child is there. And she's alive down there. If you do nothing she will drown and die! I will tell my commander of my unit when he comes back. I beg of you.. Are you deaf lady? I cannot do anything. Secret Service. - What? - Let us pass or you get court-martialed. No camera please! - Am I going on report sir? - Well see about that. Hold on, hold on. Two teams went in and found nothing. - Nobody has reached the epicentre yet. - This bunker is here somewhere. Can you show us? We've only a small time window left. I've never seen the bunker, but I think I know where it is. - Are you sure? - Yes. Ivanic! Hell of a party! Ksenia! Ksenia? Breathe, breathe! Come on, breathe! My radio is broken. My ribs too. We have to get out of here, they will close the gates now. Not while we're here. So what do we do? - The 18th here. - Go ahead. We're coming back. Denis! Denis! - Denis! - I'm over here! Here, here.. Don't you ever leave me again, you hear?! And I'll never leave you again. I promise, okay. Love Water Park! Where is Galina? What? So now you want me to find Galina? Galina! Galina does not answer. We need to get going. You crazy? Where are you going? Home. Come on, hurry remove it. Hang the hooks. Lower me down. Hold on to me. Is there anyone here?! Hello!! Attention to all units! Immediately leave the tunnel! You have 10 minutes, we're closing the gates now. - Let's go. - Is anyone there? Answer me! There's no one in there. Step aside. Did you have a good look down there? - Are you sure? - Yes, nothing. The bunker was flooded to the ceiling, all the walls were wet. No one there could have survived. Dad! Where is Vlad? He was behind us. Don't cry. They will get us out of here. They are looking for us. No one will come for us! Excuse me. Why do you say that? Why... You should know this, "Mr. Tour Guide". So tell us, what they do, when the tunnel is flooded? So, you don't want to tell them, then I will.. Dear visitors of the Moscow Metro, this station is now a danger to the whole city. If the tunnel continues... to be filled with water, then part of our beloved capital, in the truest sense of the word, collapse. You know what happens in such a case? - I'll tell you all... - Just be quiet. If it doesn't interest you.. you can go away. Let's continue. The danger zone will be closed on both sides, and the tunnel will be filled with liquid nitrogen. Soon this place... becomes.. our tomb of liquid nitrogen. That's not true, My mom is looking for us, I know it! Of course, princess. How can I be so dumb! You are right, I misbehaved. Andriej! If you only knew all the sacrifices I made these past 12 years... Of course you don't know. How could you.. I just wanted to submit a construction proposal for a "Deal of a Lifetime" My way out of this mess! And then all this... This was not supposed to happen. This can't be the end! I'm not ready to die. Why did he say that? Well princess, I... ...ran late this morning because of your mom and took the metro. I just wonder, is she worth all this. This I need to ask. Is she worth it? - Shut up. - Fuck you! Ksenia, go sit with Alisa. Go on. Hey, listen. So you can't die now.. ... because you're negotiating "the Deal of a Lifetime", while my wife is waiting for you and cries. My wife cries because of you. You've been sleeping with my wife and I... ... can't even do anything about it. She loves you, you bastard. While she's lies next to me, she cries for you. She cries every night between 2 and 4 in the morning. So what?! If you know all that, why don't you leave her, find another? Tell me one thing, though... Can you remember the last time you touched her? What? 5 months ago or even longer? Just take a good look at her. She's miserable and lonely. You pushed her away, with your principles and precious job. She is a young and beautiful woman with needs. If she get's a chance to get any guy into bed, she won't hesitate. It was me who got screwed. She doesn't need me either. It's just all about her desires. And now I will die for a babe, who's husband doesn't see and appreciate her.. Stop it! Dad! Come back, don't get involved! Dad, don't do it! Daddy, stop it! Stay out of it! Leave him alone! Wait. I can hear someone! They are in there, it's them. Don't shut it! Didn't you hear that? There is an echo. You're hearing rescue workers trying to find them. But they rang me out of the bunker. The rescuers will find them, If they are there.. I was afraid. You promise me, never to do that again. God. Oh lord, please help us... They found us. I don't believe it. They found us. They found us. They found us. They found us, we're going home. They found us, we're going home. Ivanic! Ksenia! Here the 18th, copy. Hold on! The tunnel has collapsed. Water is rushing in! - Close the gates! - Are you crazy?! - There are people here! - Shut it! - There are people here! - Close the gates! Are there people with you? Close the door, dammit! - Make a decision, close the damn gate! - Close the gates! Unit 18, answer. Where can they be? If you were told to close the door, it has to be near Borodinskaïa. They should emerge at Sadovaia, if they are still alive. Are you sure about that? 18th, can you hear me? Unit 18, come in. This is commander Burov. Answer me, 18th! Unit 18, come in. Breaking news, the leak was located and sealed. The tunnel will now be filled with liquid nitrogen as soon as possible. This method was successfully used in the 1974 St. Petersburg disaster, when workers stumbled upon the underground branch of the river Neva, and the subway was flooded with water With the help of the Russian chemical industry, and resources from across the country shipped to St. Petersburg a catastrophic disaster was prevented. The mayor believes it's the only way to prevent the collapse of downtown Moscow. This could only happen to me. 18th unit, can you hear me? - Alexander Nikolayevich. - What? Contact the Mayor. We need to make a decision about the tunnel. What? See you next time. Could I possibly..? Hey! Come on! Can we get help?! Is there anyone else? Yes, 6 survivors. Come in command. We found the 18th unit with survivors. At Novodevichy Street, plus 6. It can't be... Outstanding! Mama! - There's your nobel prize. - You think so, start filming. Come on, dad's there. Daddy's there! - Come on, give me your hand. - How many people are with you? - Get out of here. - Excuse me, I'm with the news... - Do not touch the camera! - Let us do our job. - Close your eyes. - It's fine. Hi, doggie. Welcome back, girl! - I just quit drinking, paps. - Give me that. Over there. Cheers! I told you we could do it. Miss, please sit down. Alisa! - Young man... - We are together. Really/ - Yes, mom. - Another underground adventure? No, everything's fine. I promise. Dad! Ksenia, come here! Dad. Mr. Konstantinov, come with me to the hospital. Andriej... Andriej Borisovich, you need to come to the hospital. Dad. Go. Stop! Tyavka! Tyavka! Come with us.
