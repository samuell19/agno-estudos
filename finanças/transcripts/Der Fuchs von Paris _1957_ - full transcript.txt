THE FOX OF PARIS Based on a true story by Herbert B. Fredersodorf All characters are fictious. May 1944. France is still occupied by German troops. While on the Eastern Front the Germans are in retreat, they remain strongly entrenched in western Europe. The Atlantic Wall runs from the English Channel to the Pyrenees, but their concrete bunkers are lost in the vastness of the landscape. The French coast is too long to be adequately defended. Just one question remained: 'When will the invasion begin?' France waited in anticipation. Paris seemed as tranquil as ever. But the calm was deceptive. Beneath the surface, the entire country longed for liberation. Never had the French Resistance been so active nor the German secret service so alert. The covert underground war was running red hot. He won't show, he's been tipped-off. So why has she moved to the entrance? - She knows what's at stake. - Why's she collaborating? Eight days in jail softened her up. Andre, the Gestapo! - Stop! - What do you want? Come with us. Don't do anything stupid! Come with me. KOMMANDANT OF PARIS Come back in half an hour. - Tell General Quade that Furstenwerth is here. - Yes, Sir. Hauptmann Furstenwerth to see the General. Well done, you've finally caught the infamous Andre. Get him! Stop or I'll shoot! Why didn't you shoot, you're armed? I didn't realise you shoot civilians here, Herr Oberst. I'll tell you one thing: in Paris they deserve it. The General will see you now. - Don't forget the meeting, General. - I know, I've still got a few minutes. - Welcome, my boy. - Good morning, uncle. - As you see, I'm reporting for duty. - I'm glad. After surviving three years, returning to Russia would be crazy. Weeds don't die in the frost. Did you have anything to do with my transfer to France? A little. France isn't so peaceful now. The invasion is imminent, things will get tough. - But not as bad as Russia. - I'm not so sure about that. - Will I join a Panzer division? - Yes, but you have a few days yet. And I'll enjoy my nephew's company. Where's your luggage? - At the station. - I'll have it picked up. Your mother sent you a suit. My driver will take you to my house. Relax and make yourself comfortable, I'll see you tonight. Kleinschmidt will go with you. I have work to do. - Ready, Quade? - Yes, but I'm not optimistic. We must succeed, we have no choice. Close the door, please. Gentlemen, the sole purpose of this meeting is... to hear what General Quade has to say regarding opposing the plans for France's defence drawn up by the Fuhrer's Headquarters. - General... - Do you propose that we discuss orders already issued? Certainly, Oberst. The information is not widely known or has been poorly interpreted. The Fuhrer's Headquarters is far away. We are on the spot. It's my duty... to explain what is expected of us, and analyse the facts correctly. Or am I mistaken? No, of course not. Continue, General. According to intelligence reports, the Allied invasion is imminent. Our information is very precise regarding divisions positioned on the south coast of England. We know their equipment, their material... and the strength of their reserves. We know where their battleships are stationed and have identified their airfields. The reports in front of you have all the details. Please study them carefully. I know you'll agree it will be the greatest military operation - the world has ever seen. - We mustn't be so alarmist. The coastal areas Eisenhower has selected for the invasion will be heavily bombed. We cannot prevent it, the allies have complete air superiority. One thing is certain, Gentlemen, the Allies will land and we can't stop them. What about our coastal divisions? They will be destroyed in the first 24 hours. The loss of at least three divisions is certain. Let me explain a couple of things. We are like chess players. We cannot worry about losing a few pieces, we need to win 'The Game'. But when we risk a piece we must know the objective. Our soldiers' lives are at stake. And we must sell them dearly. Excuse me, I'm digressing. If we follow the Defence plan we'll lose at least 3 divisions. An effective defense is only possible inland. A new plan was drawn up, but the Fuhrer's Headquarters rejected it. This is nice. Who lived here before? A French aristocrat who fled, Hauptmann. - So we rented it. - At least he had taste. And good Cognac. Would you like a drink, Sir? No, thanks. I'd like a bath and to get into some civilian clothes, I want to see a bit of Paris. If you like, I could give you some addresses, places other Officers like to visit? Thanks, Kleinschmidt, but I just want to see the city. I haven't been in Paris for three years. Then you'll be surprised. Paris isn't what it was. Paris is, as I always say, like a bed with no mattress. You know? Gentlemen, I must advise you what I was told at the Fuhrer's Headquarters. They have a completely different concept. Their strategists are highly trained. They know their job. They can deploy forces to best effect. Let me remind you: We must fight them everywhere. Whether they come by sea or air we must engage them robustly. They must be destroyed immediately. Resolute combat leadership is required, from those who know what they're doing. When you go to the Fuhrer's Headquarters tomorrow please take General Quade's report. On behalf of everyone? I don't think anyone here disagrees, except you, of course. Thank you, Gentlemen. Come with me, Quade. This is absurd. Did we need to listen to that? What a lot of drivel. It's ridiculous. - I knew that when I came here. - Make no mistake, Quade... whole divisions will be slaughtered. Soldiers are human, like anyone else... fathers, men with wives, mothers, families... How can I forget that? I can't, Quade. I can't do it. I can't take it anymore. I can't even sleep. Up at four or five every morning. I know all the church bells in Paris, I hear them all. And I think, and think. I can't do anything but think, think. How can I give orders, when I know, as well as you, that they make no sense. We only have one chance: Stop now and sign a peace treaty, take all our divisions, and head East. We must simply stop now. This is the only political and military decision possible: we must remedy the situation and prevent the whole of Europe sinking with us. We can't just speculate, we must take action. You know my opinion. When the time comes... But who's to say when that is? And I have to commit my divisions now. Not necessarily, General. A possibility occurred to me, perhaps... I'm listening, Quade. If the defence plans fell into English hands and the Fuhrer's Headquarters found out about it, they would be forced to change. - Are you crazy, Quade? - I know it seems impossible... And it is. A German officer cannot collude with the enemy. I'd rather commit suicide. This is no game. I'm only considering this in order to spare the lives of thousands of our men. Yes, Quade, intrigue is a dirty game. I know it's not right, but we live in a world of intrigue. We have to participate. Most of my ancestors were Prussian officers... Don't think about it, General. How can we put this into practice? Who will get the plans to the English? Our Abwehr? The SS run the show, now Canaris is gone. The only reliable Abwehr man in Paris is Major Wedekind and even he's not above suspicion. I've already spoken with him. - What did you say? - I told him everything. He thinks it's the last chance we have. Shall I send for him? Yes, General? - Send for Major Wedekind, - He's already waiting, General. You didn't say he was here already? General. Michel, Michel! You scared me to death. Come home quickly. You're soaked. It was hard to avoid. Come on, I live close by. You can dry out and I may have a suit. Well, I can't really go back to Paris in this state. - But I don't want to bother you. - It's no trouble. Dad, I've got someone here... This is Monsieur... I'm sorry I don't know his name. - He saved a boy from drowning. - Good morning. I, well... this is a awkward introduction! How can we help? I thought we might lend him one of Marcel's suits. Come on then. - I'll sort out some clothes. - This way. Here's the bathroom. - Thank you. -You'll find things in the closet. - You took a risk. - Not really. I saw someone drown once because no one... You're a German? No German has ever set foot in this house. He's a German, Yvonne. I'd better go. No. We may not like you people, but no one can say a Frenchman is dishonourable. - Father. - Come on, Francois. I didn't know who he was. But you still helped him. Please, Sir, here's the bathroom. In case you get a cold. I apologise again for the trouble I've caused, I never realised it would be such a problem. I'll return the suit tomorrow. No, I'll have it collected. As you wish. I'll leave the address. Good morning, we have an unexpected guest. A German. - He rescued a child at Versailles. - I see. - Isn't that Marcel's suit? - Yes. I'd better go now, this is clearly embarrassing for everyone. I really appreciate your help, which is undoubtedly second nature... even if not intended for a German. Good morning. - Whose address is this? - His. It's the German General's residence. I brought him here, Andre. I had no idea. So? This is interesting. Why did he leave it? It may turn out for the best. This could be very useful to us. Who knows where it could lead? - Did you recognize the man? - Straight away. - Did he know you? - I don't think so. He ran past me and jumped through the window. In that situation, he wouldn't have noticed me. He's a brave man. - Do you think I should report it? - What? No, no, no. It's not important. I mean, it is, but don't do anything. The family were kind, but suddenly started to treat me like a hot potato. But the girl was breathtaking. Lovely. What you're saying is all very interesting. You can't imagine how much. I have something for you to do. But not now, tomorrow. - Come to my office, about two. - Is it official? Yes, and it's something important that... I have to chew over a while. An old soldier's habit. As I said before, I'm glad you're here. - A brandy, Sir? - You talk as if it's so precious! I always say we took France just to get their Cognac. And now it's all gone, they'll throw us out. Are you always so pessimistic, Kleinschmidt? You know something, Sir? People like me rarely enjoy the good life, and have to make the most of it. Because, before you know it, the good times are over. Just a moment, Sir. It's a lady, Sir. You gave her this address. This way, Madam. Good afternoon. You came yourself? I thought you'd send someone. Please sit down... if you don't object. I deserved that, I came to explain... You don't have to. Don't I? My dear brother, Marcel, whose suit I gave you was killed in the war by the Germans. My mother died of a broken heart. I had no idea. Why should you? So I came to explain and to apologise. I'm truly sorry. On behalf of my family, I'd like to invite you to visit us, if you can forgive us? Will you come? Is tomorrow at 4 alright? I'd be delighted. You say you already have a man to get the plans to the English? Yes, my nephew, Hauptmann Furstenwerth. - Your nephew? - Yes. He arrived yesterday. He's been on the Eastern front for three years. I'll vouch for him. - May I smoke? - Go ahead. Why do you think... he's the man for the job? According to General Quade, he seems the ideal candidate. - Cool, calm and brave. - And is he loyal? He's as loyal as I, General. I mean... would he understand the reasons... He doesn't need to. Yesterday, by chance, he made contact with the resistance. He's been posted to Normandy to join a Panzer division. It's all completely bonafide. It sounds good to me, General. His commanding officer has no idea what's happening. He need never know. Is that OK? Oh, you're here. This is Hauptmann Wedekind, an Abwehr officer. I told him about your chance encounter yesterday. The man you stumbled upon... is one of the cleverest and most dangerous in the Resistance. Sit down, lad. Naturally, you're not familiar with the Abwehr's methods. They don't eliminate people so much, they'd rather exploit them. - And we can use that man. - May I interrupt? The girl who was at my house invited me... on behalf of her family. - That Andre is very quick. - What do you mean? It's all a sham. You gave them the address, they know exactly who lives there. No, no, no. The young lady came to apologise to me. - You think that was an excuse? - Exactly. Go and see these people and keep in contact. Pretend you don't know anything. Why? That house is an important nest of spies. We need them to steal some information. These plans must reach England via the Resistance. I understand... they're false plans. It's a sort of spy game. It's not for me. I have no experience whatsoever. You don't need any. You've come from Russia; you're just an Officer in transit. That's perfect. You're ideal for our scheme. What are these plans? I could tell you, but is it necessary? No, uncle... but you must understand I prefer to fight my enemy face to face, to masquerading in civilian clothes. For example, a girl comes to me... I understand, but you've never had such a critical mission before. Indeed, it may decide the war. Well, it does sound very important. - What do I have to do? - It's very simple. You accept the invitation to visit that house, and pretend to be a simple Hauptmann. You might pretend you've fallen in love with the girl. Whatever you're comfortable with. It's that simple. They'll fall for it. It doesn't sound too difficult... But you must be like the fox, as cunning as a fox in unknown territory. - You mean like a fox in Paris? - Exactly. And that's all there is to it. But remember, these people know what they're doing. And there's one last thing, you're sworn to absolute secrecy. Tell no one about this. Understand? Whatever happens, you must tell nobody. Al right. - Good morning, Hauptmann. - Good morning, Andre. Sorry, I can't shake hands. - I noticed the other day. Wounded? - An accident. I'm glad you came. I'm a family friend and I think that... - you were treated rather rudely. - It's forgotten. - Good morning. - Let's go inside. I'm sorry I'm late. I had some official duties. - I'm glad you came. - My pleasure. Me too. I wish we could all have met in more pleasant times. - Isn't that so? - Yes. - Please sit down. - Thanks. - Will you take tea with us? - With pleasure. You came from Fontainebleau? Did you have a meeting there? - How did you know? - It's easy. We saw military vehicles pass with a General inside. But we shouldn't talk politics. Even best friends argue over it. Or it prevents friendships in the first place. - You're right. - Been in Paris long? A couple of days. I spent three years in Russia. Paris must seem like paradise after that. True, it makes you appreciate beautiful things again. Your garden, for example. You must see it. I'll show you, if you want, before we have tea. Would you like to? Of course. It's certainly worth seeing. - Is he really such a fool? - He's fallen for Yvonne. This is all a bit odd. No Officer would leave his briefcase like that. It's a trap. He doesn't know what he's doing, he's besotted with Yvonne. Maybe. In any case, let's see what we can find. It's locked. One good thing about German briefcases is they all have the same lock. - Something important? - It could be. - Where are they? - Still in the garden. We need a few minutes, keep watching. Yvonne's keeping him occupied. I'm going to copy this downstairs. Three generations have created this garden. I'm very glad you took the time to show it to me. You said you liked beautiful things. Yes, and honesty too. I liked the honesty with which with you showed your antipathy. - Please, forget that. - I don't hold it against you. It's not always easy to be honest. The truth is sometimes uncomfortable. - Do you think so? - Don't you? Lights off. - I don't think I put that very well. - What do you mean? It was... rather superficial. You're right. War does that to many people. And it wasn't intentional. At least, not much. Although in wartime perhaps you should think a little more. Why do you say that? When I first saw you, I thought... What shall I say? I liked you. And maybe you liked me a little. Then I realized I'm German and you're French. So we're expected to hate one another. - Yes, but... - Isn't that right? - No, but... - Maybe we shouldn't discuss it. Let's go and have that tea. Not yet, I must show you the greenhouses. I hope you'll come again. Now it's time for tea. Are you sure he won't notice anything? Look out, they're coming. Well, what did you think? Isn't it a beautiful garden? It's charming. - I hope I didn't keep you too long? - On the contrary. It was a lovely idea. Let's sit. - Would you like tea? - Thanks. We checked. Everything's fine. Super, Werner. Thanks. They copied the plans, there are fingerprints in the margins. - Are you sure? - Yes, that was my best man. So there's no going back. - They copied the plan. - Congratulations. You played your part marvelously. That's clear enough. But I don't think I did myself any favours. I presume you're referring to that pretty girl. Much more than 'pretty'. And yet so false. Do you know how many people they've stabbed in the back? I'm just glad I won't have anything to do with it any more. No, my boy, you can't stop now. We must know whether our plan is on track, there can be no mistakes. You must maintain contact. We must be careful, the Germans were here today. We know you're worried. - Are you cold, Yvonne? - Yes. I hope we don't have to wait all night. Five minutes to the drop zone, Sir. Yvonne, make some tea. Every night now I think something will go wrong. The Germans must hear the planes. Don't you think so? He must have aborted. There! - Another parachute landing. - Shall we search again, Leutnant? They'd gone before we got here. Remember this site next time. - The tea's ready. - I need that, it's damn cold up there. We got your message. It's so important, I came myself. Where are the documents? Plans for the coastal defences. This is excellent material. If it's genuine. Where did you get them? From a German Captain we met by accident. - An Abwehr man? - I considered that, but... he came from Russia. A combat Officer transferred to Paris. He doesn't seem very bright. You must keep in contact. Who'll do it? Yvonne. OK then. Sometimes women are invaluable. - It's time now. - Come on, Yvonne. Send the following: Q-X-19 and L-C-3. Tell the Major. - Major. - Yes? - From Villeneuve again. - Same code? Sounds like it. I haven't sat down over a bottle of wine and talked about home for a long time. I appreciate your company. I have a question, Uncle. Why is everyone in Paris so miserable? I sense something bothering you. - Am I right? - Maybe. You're right, but I can't tell you. Yes? Who is it? Yes, please. Well, yes. No, no, we'll discuss it tomorrow. Thank you, good night. That was Major Wedekind. He has intercepted a message transmitted by the French resistance. - Do you know their code? - Yes, for three days. - The English already have the plan. - That was quick. I can't believe it's true. I'm suspicious. So I imagine. What happens now? Very simple. - You'll be put to the test. - Me? It's just something you'll have to deal with. They must believe the plan is genuine. Everything depends on it. Do you like Paris? We Germans love Paris. Does that seem strange? I've nothing against those who love Paris unless they come in uniform. There are people in uniform all over the world. They'll never go away. Is that what you think? Well, it's not unusual is it. Don't you enjoy being in the Army? It must be rather strange... living in a requisitioned house, drinking confiscated wine, - taking what isn't yours... - Now who's being serious. - Don't you want to be? - I don't know. Taking me to the Louvre and Notre Dame, showing me Paris. Why? Asking very deep questions is a German trait. And we know nothing about women. Isn't that right? Surely not. But let's go, I'll show you Montmartre. Why did you bring me here? - I thought you'd enjoy it. - And you were right. But almost all the audience is German. Your determined to have the wrong image of me. - You think so? - Yes. You have a certain image of a German soldier fixed in your mind. Most may be like that, but not all. Maybe. But it's just what I think, I mean... ...it's not important. It is for me. We're getting serious. No one does that in Paris. Shall we go? You're not enjoying this. Right. Just a moment. London's nervous. They need to know if the plans are genuine. - They don't believe it. - But the Captain's not an agent. Are you sure? We must find out immediately. - We've no time to lose. - Then... there's only one thing to do. Now you want to kiss me like... a soldier who's just picked up a girl. - You know its not like that. - How is it then? Why did you do it? Because I love you. You don't know what you're saying. You said you spent three years in Russia, you haven't been with a woman. - I can imagine... - It's hard to understand. I told you I love you. That's my affair. You don't have to do anything. It makes me very happy. There's nothing I can say, I can't. We can't meet again. Go away and don't come back. I can't explain, but please don't come back. - A new transmission from Villeneuve. - They're working like crazy. So far so good, General. This will suffice for the Fuhrer's Headquarters. - Something is worrying me. - The Hauptmann? He wants to join his troops in Normandy. I love my nephew. We get on well together. He's like a son to me. What's the matter? We'll have to ask for more than we expected. Good evening. You're still awake? We went for a... ...a walk through Montmartre. - Good evening, Hauptmann. - Good evening, Andre. - What's going on, Papa? - We have our orders, Yvonne. Excuse me, Hauptmann. In civilian clothes with a pistol? I was advised it was dangerous in Paris. And, in my view, even at a friend's house. - We're not friends. - Obviously. I don't know what's going on, Andre. This must seem like a trap. - But it wasn't. - What's that, Yvonne? Please sit down. - Can I smoke? - Staying cool, eh? I like that. I think I'll need one. You're right. Do you recognize this? - Where did you get it? - From your briefcase, Hauptmann. From my briefcase? How? When? It's impossible. Lost your cool now, Hauptmann? It's understandable: Captain loses plans. Very important German General Staff plans. There's just one problem, they're a fake. Maybe so. You know what happens to agents who fall into enemy hands? I'm sure you'll tell me. We eliminate them. Unless they decide to work for us. Then they're treated like Kings. If I understand correctly, you're making me an offer. Are you a Hauptmann who has unfortunately lost some documents? That's enough to get you court-martialled and sentenced to death. That means... I don't have much choice. Exactly. We're your only option. What's your answer, Hauptmann. - Who are you? - A French Officer in plain clothes. But don't give me an answer if you don't want to. Get the car, Francois. If you're going out, I'll come too. - Stay here, Yvonne. - No. Just a precaution, Hauptmann. They're German, by the way. Spoils of war. - The outskirts of Villeneuve. - Be careful. We must search every house. Go on to Royville and take the left fork. Stay alert. If you see anything suspicious, flash your lights. Let's go. So you won't talk. I'm sorry you've been inconvenienced. But so have I. I'm an English officer sent from London because of you. That's your problem, Mister...? My name doesn't matter. Do you smoke? Germans like English tobacco. Not all of them. May 1? What about wine? French wine is... at least for the moment, almost German. I must ask you some questions. I know you'll say: I am a German Officer... Hague Convention, etc, etc. But the rules aren't always applicable in every situation. And I'm in one of them, aren't I? Yes. War is never fair. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal. But let's be serious. I must know who you are. In particular, I have to know if the plans are genuine. What do you want to know? Right then. Where did you come from? Which unit were you in? Where did you last serve on the Eastern Front? I need names, details, dates... Within an hour I'll know if you're lying. What if I am? You're smart enough to know what would happen. He's telling the truth. He's not an agent. Don't get involved, Madame. Well then. I was in the 30th Panzer Division, I led a reconnaisance unit near Smolensk. - Well? - Nothing suspicious. Then search the next village. Do I need to say more? No, that's enough. - I've written everything down. - We'll forward it on. - Personally, I believe you . - What now? Work for us. You don't really have any choice. I stupidly forgot my briefcase for 10 minutes but I'm no traitor. Those are just words. They mean nothing. It's hard to know what betrayal means these days. Soon it'll be even more so. After the war, if we're still alive, of course, we can discuss it. That may be too late for me. But to return the current situation. I need a map of all German airfields and anticipated deployments prior to the invasion. It's in a safe in General Eisner's office in Paris. We're well informed. There's a dog barking. There's a house there. We'll check it out. Come on. We have to go: Germans coming. Lost your cool, Andre? Keep quiet. Shut that damn dog up. Well, what is it? - Do you know what that smell is? - No. English tobacco. I want the truth. Are you hiding English agents? - Look at this. - Made from a parachute. Search this man. - There they are! - Open fire! Get after them. - Get down. - Go through the forest to the mill. Let's go. Get a move on. Stay with me. - Are you hit? - It's my leg. He's been shot in the thigh. Stay down. Give me your pistol. Is he trying to kill us? He's a crack shot. Scissors. Water. Bandages. Why didn't you escape? After all, they were Germans. I thought about what you said about a Courtmartial. But Francois... you didn't have to help him. I think... you forgot this. I'm beginning to realise how you've managed to survive this war so long. - Is there somewhere to lie down? - Come with me. It's the best there is... at this time of night. Thanks. I'm very grateful. I couldn't leave him laying there. Someone did the same for me in Russia. I know how you feel. This is the strangest situation I've ever been in, escaping from my own comrades, and helping those... who should be my enemies... And worst of all is that I wanted to do it... I know. You told me you loved me. You said it was your business, I didn't say anything. Now I'm in the same situation. I love you. I'm not confusing love with gratitude. We should be happy, but we're not. Yes, but that doesn't change what I said. I know. We're in love, but we're not supposed to be. Who says it's not allowed? - You sure? - No. Where's Yvonne? I like that guy. In addition, think about the map of the airfields. You did very well, my boy. Especially to keep your nerve. None of us could have done better. Thank you very much. I fled from my own people, fired on them... And shot out their searchlight. I've become an ally of the enemy. - Unfortunately it can happen. - Enemy? An enemy to me was always someone anonymous, someone in a different uniform. Suddenly, I know the enemy. And some of them are fine people. - I mean... - Yes, what do you mean? To be between two fronts does mean exactly that: Between two fronts. Forgive me, uncle, but I feel strangely insecure. Insecure? - And I'm a traitor. - But that makes no sense. I am in the eyes of the French and the British. - They think I'm working for them. - But you're not, are you? Yes, yes. But it's all becoming so... So... What should I do about the airfield maps? Give them to them. You have to, my boy. It will prove the veracity of the other documents. And then I promise you, your part will be over. Quade here. I'll come. That was the chief, Toller's back from the Fuhrer's Headquarters. I'm see you tonight. Goodbye. Hello? - Call Unteroffizier Kleinschmidt. - Yes, Sir. Hello, Hauptmann. Have we met before? I don't think so. I could swear I know you, I never forget a face. I only arrived from Russia a week ago, I was there 3 years. I've been in Paris for 3 years. You've had better luck than me then. It was just as I thought. The Fuhrer's Headquarters rejected any change to the plans. I was ordered to inform you of the poor impression your stubborness created. There were other unfavourable comments too like... the unanimity amongst senior Staff Officers regarding the execution of the Fuhrer's Headquarters' orders smacking of a conspiracy. Major Wedekind? General, a couple of days ago we intercepted a message from which it's clear the English have copies of the Fuhrer's Headquarters' plans for the defence of France. How? It's impossible. The radio message leaves no doubt. There must be some swine amongst us... Forgive me, General. Like you, Oberst, I'm shocked and furious too. I've already ordered General Quade to investigate. What we must do urgently is to get the transcriptions of the radio message to the Fuhrer's Headquarters. The doctor says everything is fine, you'll be recovered in 3 weeks. There'll just be a small scar. Everyone is very proud of you. An you've done this family a great service. - I don't know what to say. - No need to say anything. Let Francois get some rest. Are you coming? - See you later. - Yes. - Is this your room? - Yes. I need to talk to you. Looking for a way out? There isn't one. We must wait until it's over. That's too long. And... - Are you aware of your situation? - Yes. - Really? - What do you mean? I thought about you and tried to put myself in your position. And? An unfortunate situation has made you... ...a traitor to your country. What should I do? I'm in same situation as you. I love you and that feels like a betrayal. Although, I don't know how a feeling can be a betrayal. What do we do? Get away from here. Go to Switzerland. It's not hard to get false passports. Staying here would mean losing everything. I don't want that. I can't. From what I see, Hauptmann, your conquests have expanded into a personal area. It's none of your business, Andre. It's his and mine. Well. Then we'll discuss something which is my business. I'll bring the maps tomorrow. But not here. The house is under surveillance. Where's Andre? You shouldn't be here, it's too dangerous. Even more so for Andre, he's too well known. And I didn't want to lose an opportunity to talk to you. - You still owe me a reply. - I know. We'd be together. Yvonne, I love you. But I have to finish some things. Then everything will be better. Here are the documents. But be careful. You're under arrest, Hauptmann Furstenwerth. I said I never forget a face. Hold it right there, Hauptmann! I think we need to discuss this. - I've never seen you before. - I'm listening, Hauptmann. - But I told you I never forget.. - You're wrong. - You don't know how wrong you are. - Come on. - What's happened? - Furstenwerth has been arrested. By the SD, while he was delivering the plans. Oberst Toller is questioning him. My God! If he talks, we're all finished. Even you? So let's begin. You've behaved like a swine, Hauptmann. A coward and traitorous swine. I hope you can back up every word, Herr Oberst. Sit down. Who do you think you're talking to? Are you trying to be funny? Do you deny you're a traitor? I'm talking about those documents you were about to hand over. They're not worth much. If you bothered to check them, you'd see. Perhaps you can explain then, Hauptmann? We know the documents were stolen from General Eisner's safe. The General didn't know how. Anything to say, Hauptmann? No, Herr Oberst. You prefer silence? That won't help you. No one keeps quiet for long. You'll be questioned day and night. No sleep, no food. We'll get what we want. I'm not worried, this will all be sorted out. So until... - I mean... - What do you mean? I'm being unjustly accused. I'm sick of your attitude. Who is the woman you were with? - Please continue, General Eisner. - Yes, well... I really don't know... When Major Wedekind asked for the documents, I just said: They're in my safe. I was shocked. - What could I do? - In a dangerous situation like that you should have arrested and interrogated all staff. This is catastrophic for the invasion Defence plans. - Can he hold on? - I don't know. He'll be waiting for us to get him out of there. He must be wondering: Why doesn't he come and clear this up? But... I can't go. What were you doing there that night? I recognized you. Who are you working for? Don't think we'll let you stay quiet for much longer. Why do you keep looking at the door? Take him away. I advise you to change your tactics, Hauptmann Furstenwerth. What I can do, Wedekind? There must be something. By God, I can't just abandon him. If I had my way - I wouldn't hesitate. - But we have a chance to get the Defense Plan changed and save thousands of mens' lives. - And more besides. - I can't forget that. Have I made a mistake? Was I wrong to involve him? But we had no choice. You know the terrible situation we face. But that man's the scapegoat, and innocent too. Wedekind, I can't just do nothing. You must, General. Oberst Toller is here. Stick to our story, don't make him suspicious. I assume you know what's happened, General? As you see, Oberst, I'm very distressed by what has happened. The Hauptmann is your nephew, General. He was staying with you. Yes, for eight days. - He came from the Eastern Front. - Yes, I know. Do you have any idea why he did it? No. As I said, I am utterly shocked. What kind of man is he? Have you had any conversations that might suggest his character and convictions are questionable? No, no. He wanted to join his troops in Normandy. Surely there must have been some indication? An experienced and decorated combat Officer comes to Paris and becomes a traitor? There must be a reason. Presumably he's saying... nothing? Yes. As you can imagine, I'm very interested in resolving this on personal grounds. Should I speak to him myself? As you say, there must be a reason. Open. Open up! Open the door! Thank God. I thought I'd go crazy. It makes no sense to keep me locked up... But everything's OK now. I didn't say anything because... - Keep your voice down! - Why? I don't understand, I don't understand anything. - Why can't you get me out of here? - I have something to tell you. You have a right to know. The Defence Plans you handed over... were genuine. Here in Paris we knew they were fatally flawed and would cause the senseless deaths of thousands of men, the unnecessary annilhilation of several divisions. If the Fuhrer's Headquarters found out they were in Allied hands, they would have to change them. The Defence Plan would be replaced by one we prepared long ago. So I've been... ...some sort of blind postman? A man to be used but told nothing. - Yes, that's how it was. - Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me the truth, and ask me top join you. Would you have done? In any case, what are these Defence Plans? I know nothing about them. All you say is: Those plans are bad, ours are better. How do you know? Who would know? Even if you were right, what could I do? Become the traitor I am now? What will become of me? There'll be a Courtmartial and you'll be condemned to death. To death? Me? Yes, if you don't talk. - Are you asking me not to? - I couldn't ask anyone that. Oh yes, you are. You're just trying to be subtle. I must leave the decision to you. Must you? If it's in my hands, I'm not playing. I won't die like a criminal. These are your dirty games, not mine. I fear for your sanity, I'd give anything to take your place. I'm sorry, but this is all so unreal... It's ridiculous. If I have understood correctly, it's my death, rather than thousands? That's what you said, right? Yes, you said that. Well, it doesn't reassure me at all. It does nothing for me. I want to live, I'm not interested in arguments I know nothing about. I know, Oberst, I'm coming. Well, Hauptmann? Anything to say? Leave me alone. A visitor, General. A friend of the Hauptmann. Is it true he's been arrested? Yes. Orderlies like me who look after Officers are usually good judges of character. In my view, the Hauptmann is a an honourable man. They've arrested the wrong person. Excuse me, General. You don't know me but I must ask you something: What will happen to Hauptmann Furstenwerth? Are you... Yvonne? - Yes. - He told me about you. What happened? He's been arrested. You know that already. Is there...? Is there any hope? What will they do to him? Please tell me the truth. Why do you want to know? You're French, you belong to the Resistance. Why are you interested in the fate of a German Officer? I love him. Will they condemn him to death? My God... What can I do? I'm French. As you say, I belong to the Resistance. Yet I've come here to a German General's home to ask what can be done. You're his Uncle. There must be something you can do? I don't know. Please answer my question. We can't stay here doing nothing. I can't. Whatever you think, I know he's innocent. I know, I know him. These men want to kill him for what he's done... You're a General, you have influence. You could speak in his favour. Why won't you? I can't. Please leave. Go now. He helped us. He saved Francois' life. Why can't we help him? He's no agent. I'll help you, Yvonne. But how? He'll be in a military prison. It's impossible. Once inside, there's no way to get him out. Who would have thought I'd be interested in the fate of a German Officer! - Is there really nothing? - Believe me, Colonel. If it were possible to get someone out of a military prison, we'd do it. - General? - I told you I wasn't to be disturbed. Yes, but Major Wedekind is here. Sorry to interrupt you but I didn't want to use the telephone. The Hauptmann hasn't spoken for two weeks. Not one word. They stopped the interrogation today. He's been condemned to death. He'll be executed in the morning. And... there's something else. News from the Fuhrer's Headquarters. The Defense Plan has only been slightly amended. The original idea remains, coastal defence. So everything was in vain? Everything we've done? Even... the sacrifice of the Hauptmann? Listen, Wedekind. If so, I have to speak up. He can't be executed. - I'll take all the blame myself. - General, they'll execute him anyway. But another twenty, thirty, perhaps hundreds, share our views. When the invasion comes, this madness will finally be over. You're right. For a moment, I tried... to forget the danger. But I can't. - General... - No, I've decided, Wedekind. There's no other way. Goodnight, Major. Goodnight, General. What do you want, Father? My confession? If that's your intention, just leave me alone. I'm not interested. I'm just here to help. I can leave, if you prefer. Or I can listen. Will you listen? Thanks. I'm used to death, Father. A soldier has to be. But I never imagined it would be up against a wall. But you know how I've felt since yesterday? Since I knew I had only one more day to live. It's just an hour away now. I feel there's something terribly wrong totally... wrong. This war. All wars. What a useless waste of energy and life: to wear unforms, to pin badges, to invent rules which tell us what is important and what is not... How wrong we are, Father. The game is tired and boring. A game over a border we want to expand, or opinions we want to impose by force. It's always the same thing, again and again. This world is like smoke-filled room, Father. There must be a window somewhere that could be opened to let some fresh air in. Well, Furstenwerth? Still nothing to say? You wouldn't understand anything I'd have to say. What's that woman doing there? I don't know. But you never miss a pretty girl, do you?
