Rick, shall I tell the porters to wait here with our luggage? Tell them to take our stuff inside. - Hello. - Good morning. My name's Richard Spear. I have booked one of your rooms. - Just a minute, sir. - Thank you. There you are, Mr. Spear. The keys to the royal suite. - Sign here, please. - Royal? - Yes, sir. - And how much would that cost me? It's already been paid for, sir. - If that's the case... - Something's wrong? Nope, nothing. - This way, sir. - This is our suite, huh? Looks pretty cosy, I'd say. - Rick, it's gorgeous! - Yeah, not too shabby. - It's just so gorgeous! - The bedroom is over there. - Let's see. This way, sir. Come here a second, Carol. Come and see what I've found. Wow! I'd love to try it right now! Isn't the canopy a little off-putting? Pretty comfortable, huh? Let's hope it doesn't creak. Beds are also made for sleeping, you know? This is for you. - Thank you, sir, much appreciated. - My pleasure. - See you in a couple of hours, darling. - Where are you going? - Strictly male business! - Oh, no! - Buy a carpet, Mister! Good quality! - Nope. - Buy two, then! A real bargain! - No. Wanna buy a carpet, Miss? Good quality! Want two? That one looks great. Put it on your forehead like a tiara. Ready? Let's snap another. Give me a close-up now. There. Done. - May 1? - Oh, sorry. Yeah, looking great. Now one sitting down. Yes, perfect. Thanks, the pictures will turn out great. I'm looking for Mahmoud, is this his shop? It certainly is, as if it were written in the sacred Koran. My friend Robert from New York sent me here. Treat your old bones to a walk, Mustafa, and may Allah bless you. Robert, huh? Many Americans arrive and just as many leave. - I can't remember every single one. - Fair enough. He told me that I could find what I needed here. Give us a smile, Mr. Mahmoud. - And you're looking for what? - A shaving kit. - Thanks. - Let's go snap some more pictures! - Sit down, please. - Thank you. A shaving kit? It's not the kind of stuff I deal with, Mister... All right, but maybe you could help me with the stuff I really need. Here's the list. | also need a nice gift for a girl. A pretty blue-eyed girl, by any chance? By any chance, indeed... - I believe I have just the thing. - Good. - Something for the neck, maybe? - Perfect. Nope, smoking Kills. I'm so sorry, that was totally unexpected. Right. A thief looking to rob you blind, probably. What did that guy want from me? Maybe something as valuable as this, but he wasn't lucky. Do you like it? - It's gorgeous, Rick. - Glad you like it. But I'll let you keep it only if you can get ready in half an hour. Not one second more. I'll take it back just in case. I could thank you right now, you know? - You're already one minute down. - Rick... One minute and ten seconds, you better hurry. It wasn't easy, but I've got what you need. - Every single thing you listed. - Excellent. And how much will that cost me, by the way? Two thousand pounds, and I already know what you are going to say. Keep in mind, though, that finding that sort of material isn't a walk in the park. I would like to have a look at it before paying you. - Does that mean you don't trust me? - Should I? Well, two thousand pounds is a fair price. A higher fee would have seemed dishonest. Carol, meet the gentleman who sold me your necklace. Mr. Mahmoud. - Glad to meet you. - I'm enchanted, Madam. May I invite you to an Istanbul by night tour? - Why, of course. - Absolutely. Oh, boy! My potbelly is too heavy, let's return to our table! I didn't imagine you were such an avid dancer. I'm a man full of surprises. I'll go powder my nose. - I'll be back in two minutes. - All right, darling. When are you going to do that little job? Well, I'll do it when the time is right. I understand. Here's the keys. I put everything in the car. - It's parked in front of the hotel. - Perfect. I'd like to offer you a deal, once you're done with this job. It's work-for-hire, I don't even know what it's about. Well, at least I asked first. I pay good money too, everyone knows that. Well, I better get some good sleep and think about your offer. - We can go together. - Thanks. A message for you. Excuse me. I hope you won't deprive us of your company, Mr. Abdullah. - What is it, Omeida? - There's something strange on the radar. Looks like someone flying from tree to tree. And he's heading towards the villa. The directional microphone, hurry! Get ready to drop anchor. Done, now we'll be able to hear everything, even inside the house. - He's approaching the house. - And our alarm system? Well, he's managed to fly above it. This guy is real good. Now all he has to do is open the window. I can't hear a thing, I wonder what the hell he's doing. Why can't we hear anything!? It sounds like he's playing a video game. Stop talking nonsense, you idiot! Congratulations, Mr. Spear. You son of a bitch... Rick, old boy. So Scotland Yard was right. Dean. Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Sedat. He's not only a personal friend, but also my banker here in Turkey. Mr. Elliott here has come from London to see you. The same goes for Mr. Brown. From Washington. All of them bankers, I suppose. Rupert. Bacardi, half a glass of milk, two ice cubes. Unless I'm mistaken. You'll never cease to amaze me. What's the meaning of this charade? No, it wasn't a charade. A test, more like. To my surprise, Scotland Yard gave me your dossier. You had vanished, I even thought you were dead. Here. Very detailed, I see. What happened to you, anyway? A little accident that confined me to this wheelchair. - Ah, sorry to hear that. - Don't be. My present condition could make you twenty thousand pounds richer. Slow down a bit and tell me what this is all about. Read that stone tablet and you'll know the answer. It's proof that the temple of the Sun god exists, and maybe even the key to open it. This piece of clay? That piece of clay is thousands of years old, Mr. Spear. Hey, I've never claimed the opposite. What's so interesting about this temple of the Sun god? - Of course. - It's the burial site of the legendary Gilgamesh. A demigod, fathered by a demon. He's buried with a sceptre, the symbol of his might. Look. Come closer, I'll show you. We believe it might look like this. This drawing is a reproduction of some ancient engravings. Boy, those gems must be worth a fortune. That's secondary, but I'd give my life to find the sceptre. We'll take care of the dying part. We do not want it to fall into the hands of some... ... power-hungry individual who would use it for political purposes. Damn Western swine! We don't want some religious group to... They still believe they rule the world. ... organise a tribal uprising... I must return upstairs. Record it all. You reckon that could really happen? They already tried to Kill you, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, a man with the tattoo of an eye on the palm of his hand. That's the symbol of the Demons of Gilgamesh, a sect of dangerous fanatics. I'm a burglar by trade, not a politician. - Why did you pick me? - Because of your professional skills. The temple is supposedly protected by an unbreakable door. Well, I heard a touch of nitro does wonders, not a problem at all. The German who wrote this book spent years searching for the underground temple. No luck, I presume? He did find it, actually, but he wasn't able to open that door. Apparently, people built security systems even in ancient times. I guess there were already quite a few colleagues of mine around. Quite correct. Let's not digress, though. Opening the door in the wrong way would trigger a self-destruct mechanism. You'll have to open it the same way the high-priests opened it. And when he'll open it we'll take what's rightfully ours! Sounds like a walk in the park. What happened to the man who wrote the book? He was a Jew. The Nazis killed him. And I suppose the book doesn't tell where the temple is. Obviously not. Archaeologists are quite jealous of their secrets. And they have a wild imagination. I'm sure this sceptre doesn't even exist. - |t does, Rick. - I have to think it over, Dean. I know you too well, you like a good challenge. You are already thinking of a way to open that door, admit it. You're nothing but a despicable bastard. I'll tell you more. The man who discovered the temple had a young assistant. This boy has gotten older, naturally. I've managed to track down his last address. I also know he wears a strange medallion. Find him, he'll be of great assistance. Come on, spill the guy's name already... There, everything's written on this piece of paper. Okay. Why didn't any others try to find him, though? Out of fear for some silly superstition. But I'm positive we'll manage to find him. Even if I had to do it myself. If the sceptre fell into the wrong hands it would pose a serious threat to the West. You're our ace in the hole. - You must find it. - Okay. - A toast to the sceptre, then. - To the sceptre. Waiter? - A wonderful party. - You're too kind. - It was an honour for us. - More for me. Here's everything we've intercepted, Sir. - So that thief and the... - They're friends. A burglar to open that door. Wise thinking, I shall admit. Bring him to me at once, you understand? Dead or alive, yes. - Omeida! -Yes sir? Do not bring him to me dead, you idiot, I need that man alive. The coast is clear, sir. Not a soul in sight. Thanks, Rupert, and sorry about the waiter quip. Freeze! Raise your hands and don't move a muscle! You're the thief, huh? No funny business, my boss needs you alive. Alive? - Good to know. - No! Aim for the tyres! Quick, after him! - They were waiting for him? - And they're now chasing him, Sir. Take the first right at the end! He's done for! Step on it! Faster, we can make it! We've got him now! Don't stop, the freight cars are open! You bloody idiot, why did you brake!? The door was closed! Somebody help! Have a nice trip, lads! - Hello, honey. - Hi, pussycat. Did you sleep well? Splendidly. - You must feel pretty fit right now, then. - More than ever. Master! We are returning by train and we'll kidnap the American's girlfriend to blackmail him. Returning by train? I don't understand. Go back to the radio and keep your ears open! That fool let him escape... Hurry up! No time to waste! Cover her! Quick, let's go! Help! Three men stole our laundry cart and went that way! - That way? I'll handle this! - Yes! Put her in the truck, hurry! Get a move on! Sorry, pal, need to borrow your vehicle! Thief! Somebody stop him! I hope they lock you up! Into the boat, hurry! Drive! - Here, let me try your toy for a minute! - Hey, wait! There he is! On your feet! Get up! - Thanks! - My pleasure! - Walk! Move it! - No! No! - Shut up and walk! - No! Get your hands off me! Let me go! Help! Let me go! Carol! This way! At last, darling. I don't like those two guys. - There! It's them! - Yeah! Told you! - What do we do now? - Care for a swim? Who could have done it? Nope. I bet you're hiding something from me, aren't you? I'm afraid I can't tell you yet, Carol. Anyway, I think you should go back to New York. But why should I leave, Rick? I don't want to leave you here alone. And I don't want you to go either, but it's necessary. Rick, what's wrong? Rick! Don't you feel well? Answer me! God, I need to find a doctor... That won't be necessary. His Bacardi was drugged. Do not worry, though. A powerful sedative, but absolutely harmless. Aside from a little headache, that is. - You did this. - I had no choice. I would not want anyone to think of blackmailing Mr. Spear. And they could use you to do it. That's why I'm going to take you somewhere safe. Maybe I should alert the police. I'll be even safer, don't you think? You might be, perhaps. But not Rick. Has he ever told you about his rocky relationship with cops? If you're lying I'll... I've been kidnapped twice in a single day, I'd just like to know why! Please, this is not the right time. - Get in. - Ma'am. May Allah turn you into a mummy, you've taken the wrong road! I'm taking the lady somewhere safe, isn't it what you wanted as well? Make it three kidnappings... Come in. Your Grace, Miss Carol. Glad to meet you. You'll be my guest for a bit, I hope you don't mind it. Sure, who doesn't like being tossed around like a rugby ball. A rugby ball? Oh, I understand what you mean. I absolutely agree, being moved from place to place is not very pleasant. I hope this will be your last kidnapping for today, Rupert will take care of you. - Am I right, Rupert? - Let me take you to your room, Miss. I don't want to steal any more of your time. Oh, you've already stolen plenty. Don't you think, Sir? She'll be safe here. Quit slacking off! Master. I send you to capture him and your car ends up in a freight car. I order you to kidnap the girl and she gets away. Bunch of fools! The guy used a water cannon against us, he caught us by surprise! Don't worry, I'll pump him with lead next time! You bumbling idiot. I'll have you soaking in alum for a month! You have a date for a brain! I have no use for that man if he's not alive! Kidnapping the girl was the first smart idea you had in your whole life. You must find her again. What are you waiting for? Get on with the job, you idiot! Well? Get on with the job, you idiots! You'll be as good as new in a few minutes. Thanks, Doc. You're a regular miracle worker. No, I would not drink from that bottle. The drug was in the rum. You have any idea on who might have done it? A sedative salesman, maybe. No, I haven't the foggiest. How much do I owe you? - We'll handle it, don't worry. - Thanks. - You'll feel better after a shower. - Try to rest. Mahmoud! You're only a bag of wind, but I know how to make you talk. You can let the air out of the bag, but good luck making it talk. Unless you count a nasty noise as talking, that is. Either you start talking or you better commit your soul to the holy prophet. So? Come on, spill the beans. - Don't be a hero. Where is it? - Who? The prophet? Where's the girl? I have no idea. The prophet said that no water springs from an empty well. Looks like I have no use for you, then. - I can kill you. - If it is written... Right. Let's go! - I heard a gunshot! - Where? Mahmoud's! There's nobody here. There's blood on the floor. You have a look in there. You check that room. This window's locked. There's no one in the backroom. All right, I think we can leave. Let's lock the place up for now. Excuse me. Stand back! - What happened? - We're trying to find out. - Where's Mahmoud? - Who knows, but he was in the shop. - When we arrived he wasn't... - Got it, thanks. Fish! Buy our catch of the day here! You the guy they call Roach? I ain't talking. I'm all out of lubrification and my tongue ain't workin'. Lookie here. Where did you get it? - You a cop or something? - Nope, I'm no cop. - Let's down a bottle together. - Hold this for me. They call me Roach because I pester anyone to offer me a drink. - You sure you're not a cop? - Nope, trust me. I got a few bottles stashed in my hotel room. Nice, but what do you want from me? - Information, that's all. - Concerning what? About a certain temple. Me and Professor Gelbaum went there so many years ago. I was just a kid back then. I guess you've forgotten everything, huh? This liquor's got a nice kick to it. No, I haven't forgotten. I remember the caves and the door closing the temple. A giant door carved in solid gold and reaching to the ceiling. You remember how to reach the temple? Absolutely not, the professor used a map to get there. It took us four days of walking through the desert. But if you got back there would you be able to recognise the entrance? Could be, but I have no intention of going back there. You won't have any luck finding anybody who will do it. All because of the curse. The man who'll profane the tomb will be swallowed by the depths of hell. - Hey! - What? - Fancy some rum? - Why? Another empty bottle, maybe it's got a hole at the bottom. Dammit, I didn't realise I chugged the whole thing. This one's special. - Good for sleeping, too. - If you say so. A sip of rum can work miracles. It ain't holy water, you know. It can't possibly work miracles. My apologies. It was the only way. Go in, move it. He must have gone down that trapdoor. That's why the cops didn't find the fat slob's body. That tub of lard built himself a secret passage. How could a dead man use a secret passage? Somebody must have carried him down there, you idiot! Go down and take a look, maybe we'll find the girl as well. Remember, we need her alive! Don't move a muscle. Good boy. What? Did you say something? The American! Get down there, hurry! There he is! - What happened? - We gotta get him out of here, hurry! You were supposed to take him alive, you fools! Omeida, help! Give me a hand! I want to know who fired! It was Leijo! - You'll die with the burglar, then! - No! Still breathing, huh? - You know those guys? - People who wanted me dead. - Did you get shot? - My wall let caught most of it. But my belly did the rest. You won't get lucky twice if you don't tell me where Carol is. - Come on, spill it! - She's safe. And I'm supposed to believe you? Where? I'll tell you once we get out of here. It's full of rats down here, and they can smell my blood. Yeah, talk about a banquet. The rats are coming! Look! Filthy beasts! - There's more! - Gross! Let's go. If those guys are so keen on catching you, you must have something big on your hands. I don't know yet. Could be. Give me a hand. Come on. - That boat... - It's mine. I'll untie the rope. That fire was a blessing, after all. They'll think I'm dead and leave me alone. I want in on this thing. Don't forget, I almost got killed because of you. It won't be a walk in the park, think you can do it? Allah will give me the strength. Come on, step on it. You couldn't be a bigger idiot. They didn't find the body of the American, nor his friend's. They've escaped through the sewers. Go to the radio room and raise the alarm. Alert everyone. Yes, Master. And I won't tolerate any more failures this time. My, what an awful smell! There must be a sewer leak somewhere. No leaks, it's us. Come on, open the gate. Surely you don't want to appear before His Grace like this! I guess you're right. We'll shower and get changed first. I'm sure I can find you a suitable bathrobe, but for your friend here... - How do you do, Rick? - Not bad, it's a miracle I'm still alive. You could have warned me it was so risky. Roger Moore would have been better suited for such a mission. Oh, you're not too bad, but definitely not as strapping. What about old Nero behind you? I would have gotten lost in the sewers had it not been for his help. So I decided to have him join the party for this adventure. What? A two-bit crook like him? Better safe than sorry, that's my motto. If he is useful to you, Rick, I won't oppose your decision. Thank you, Mister. Just to make things clear, I can be completely honest. - If I choose to, obviously. - That's precisely my point, sir. - I strongly doubt you'll choose to. - That's enough, Rupert. So? Did you come up with a plan? I need to get Roach first. He's currently asleep in my hotel room. We'll leave tomorrow morning, by helicopter. - Anything else? - I don't think so. Your room, Sir. I have personally taken care of making it as cosy as possible. I hope you will find it to your liking. Certainly, Rupert, I have utmost faith in you. Good night, sir. Hey. But... I must be dreaming. Is it really you? Well, it doesn't matter if I'm dreaming. I've got to make up for all the time I wasted waiting for you. You're not leaving this time. - I'll keep heading south, okay? - Okay. Roach? What's going on? Where am I? What am I doing here? We're flying! I'm on a helicopter! You sobered up? You're kidnapping me, I'll report you people to the police! Kidnapping you? What for? No one would ever believe you! Look outside and see if you recognise any of these places. Hey, look up there. Send a radio message, report that we've spotted a helicopter. Hello, hello, we saw a helicopter. It's heading south. We are near the Sakaar Oasis. Awaiting instructions. Yes, roger that. Standing by. They've spotted them! Alert all tribes to maintain radio contact. I want to know if they're landing. Call me as soon as you have new information, be ready for departure. Perfect, nothing can stop us now. Hello? Let us know if they're landing. I seem to remember these places. The lake and that strangely-shaped mountain. Yes, yes. The professor was scared when he saw it. Why? I don't know, but he was definitely scared. That night, by the campfire, he told me he had a strange feeling. He thought what he saw was a bad sign. It's shaped like a giant swastika! Did you see it? If Hitler had seen it, he'd have made this desert his domain! Of course! That's the bad sign the professor was talking about... ... when he set up camp in the desert! But for many religions the swastika IS a magic, mystic symbol! Not for a Jewish man who lived under Nazi rule, though. Roach, try recognising anything down there. Land near that ridge. - Yeah, down there. - Roger. I'll come back to get you in two days, same time. Yeah, and update Mr. Dean on our location. Okay, good luck! - Hey, Roach! - Huh? Feel free to go back now if you've changed your mind! - You'll still get paid, don't worry! - No way, mate! You've kidnapped me and you're gonna take me back! And [ ain't riding that thing again, I'd rather walk! Yeah, but... I'm sure me and Professor Gelbaum passed through this area. I recognise this place. I remember we passed through those kind of stone spires. A strange sight, huh? Come on, let's go. This desert was inhabited many years ago. It was ruled by Gilgamesh, the demigod. He had the most powerful army in the world. They've landed, it's only a matter of capturing them now. - It'll be dark soon, let's set up camp. - All right. There's a series of big caves up there, we'll be more comfortable in them. That's where the professor set up one of his camps. Play it cool, we're being watched. This way. Don't move! Who sent you? Talk! - Everything all right, Rick? - Yeah! He has a tattoo on the palm of his hand. The eye of the Demons of Gilgamesh. I don't think those were nomadic tribes. I didn't see any flocks, children or anything like that. Just men marching. Some were on camels, but I saw vehicles as well. They were all heading towards the mountain. I see. - Be ready for departure. - All right. - Rupert will keep you updated. - Okay. Miss. See you. - Do you think Rick might be in danger? - Yes. I'm afraid so, unfortunately. What are you going to do about it? Help Rick and the others, of course. I'll handle it personally. We'll take the helicopter and go rescue them. But it can't be, you... It's easy to catch a stray bullet in the Middle East. What a hypocrite, to think I felt so sorry for you... I merely took advantage of my recovery period. You got your friend in trouble with a dirty trick. That doesn't seem the proper way to act for a British nobleman. If there were only honest British nobles, England would still be a Roman province. We're risking our necks to find a sceptre worth billions. And what do we get? Peanuts! Here's your coffee. A good point, but I'm here on behalf of Lord Dean, and I don't steal from friends. Have you considered how much money we could make selling that thing? We'd be set for life. - My answer is still no. - Ah, whatever. Cheers! What's going on? - What did he see? - There was a man up there. Rick! Rick! What if the legend is real? No, that was a man, not a demon. Let's go. Trying to chase him would be pointless. I wonder where that fellow has gone. There's miles of these tunnels. - They used to be deserted. - And now they're pretty crowded. Indeed. It was probably another one of those tattooed guys. What do they want from you? - I thought you figured that out. - What? They hope I'll find the temple. Why don't they look for it themselves? Sure, but they wouldn't know how to open the door. - You're right. - Good night. Freeze! Freeze, I said! Don't move a muscle! Stop! Roach! - Do you see him? - Stay behind me. There's blood here, he's wounded. Rick! It's full of snakes down there! Your hand! Quick! Give me your hand! Rick, watch out! Careful! Almost there! That was a close call! We've got to catch him at once, or he'll give it another try! Rick! What are those lights? This flour mill was broken the last time I saw it! Somebody must have repaired it! It looked totally different the last time I saw it! Watch out! Get back! Oh boy! What sort of a strange place is this? There he is. He's done for. Hey, our medallions look the same! Maybe he stole it from somebody! Who gave you this? Professor Gelbaum... - The professor... - He gave it... - He gave it to me... - Hans! Hans, don't you remember me? We both accompanied the professor! - Why are you still here? - Waiting... Maybe he knows where the door is! Hans, where's the temple? You can tell me. - We were friends back then. - He said that... - He said he'll return after the war... - But where's the temple? Where? There... There... The professor's things... He guarded everything for years. Poor Hans. Let's have a look. These are some notes written by the professor. - What's that? - It's a map. Things should get easier now. Hey, I also recognise this other place! Let's follow the path. End of the line, perhaps. Yes! This is it, I've already been here before! We're going that way, follow me! Well, what are we waiting for? Yes, I'm sure we came through here! The entrance must be over there! He looks like a truffle dog who caught a scent. Yeah. Whatever he finds, we should still find a way to open that door. That's the way to the cave where the temple is. You still got that bottle? Of course. It's all yours, Roach. - Thanks, Rick. - You deserve it. There's a narrow opening up there. We used it to reach the entrance to the temple. There it is. The professor had this entrance walled up to prevent anyone finding it. It's still intact. - Can we tear it down? - Of course. They have just entered the cave. Roger that. Perfect... They've entered the ghost city, there's no way they can escape us. They might be close to the temple, Master. This is where they are, we must close in and take them by surprise. But not until they've found the temple. Then the sceptre will finally be mine. - We must get going at once! - Yes, Master. Your ancient power will be rekindled, Gilgamesh. So far so good, Rick. Ain't no ancient curse that can stop us, am I right? Stay still. - What's wrong? - Stay completely still. Thanks, Rick. Careful with that belly of yours, if you get stuck we're all done for. Hey, look over there. There's a skeleton. Yeah, I see it. Now I remember, this skeleton belonged to one of the men in the expedition. He had a medallion just like mine, see? He was the youngest porter. We had to leave the body here after he died of fever, the day we discovered the cave. - A bad omen. - Hogwash. Let's go. Watch your step, guys. This mountain was originally a volcano. We may fall into some chasm full of glowing lava. The symbol of the Sun god. It's amazing... It's just as I remember it. This place still looks like an outpost of hell. You think there's a reason they built the temple here, Rick? I'm afraid I do. Isn't it incredible? That door is made of solid gold. Gold... God, thank you for giving me the chance to see this again. You couldn't imagine the times I've dreamed of coming back here, Rick. You think you can open it? Too early to tell. But if those ancient high-priests managed to, I'm sure we'll find a way. - How much further? - We're approaching the landing zone. I see some vehicles down there in the oasis. Let's go take a closer look. I'll make a low pass. You and your men will set up camp behind these hills and won't move until... Fire! Shoot down that helicopter! Damn, those guys are going to tear us to pieces! The oil pressure is down! They must have hit the fuel pump or the tank! Can you land it? That's what I'm trying to do. - I want you to take them dead or alive! - Master! We're going to capture them, they had to land near the ghost town! They've come to get their friends who found the cave. We must avoid that at all costs. You take care of that, I'll deal with the others. What are you waiting for, idiots? Let's move! They hit one of the feed lines. Can you make it back without the extra weight? - I guess so. - All right. As soon as you've fixed it come back and get us, we're in your hands. - Got it? - Yeah. Time for a stroll, my young American friend. Let's hope we won't regret this. Like sheep into the wolves' lair. But even sheep have teeth, Sir. Yes, a valid point. There they are, they didn't get far. Hands in the air. Don't tell me you guys were waiting for a ride. Call the others, tell them we're taking the targets to the camp. Yeah. Let's just say you guys blew your chance. But it won't do you any good. We Brits are very sporting, but one more rebuttal and I'll smash your head in. Rupert, tie them up good. It's sturdier than a bank vault. Lend me your back, Mahmoud. - You okay? - Yes. Let me try this spot. We're good to go, the camels are ready. Very well. Dammit! After them! Calling tanker truck, block the entrance to the gorge. Do you read me? We're on our way. Blast it... Take a left turn, Sir! Look out and take cover! Let's go, hurry. I cannot find a keyhole, there's too many suitable holes. Something like this, see? I just don't know what to do. Those who built the temple knew what they were doing. - Hey, Roach! - I just had a sip! Don't get mad at me. Mad? Quite the opposite. It's hollow! There must be a trapdoor. - Roach, get my tools! - Yes! Help me clear the dirt. Here, take. It's a big slab of stone. Almost there, gotta pry it. Careful, I don't wanna lose a hand. Come on. Don't stop, it's starting to move! Almost there... Almost... Looks like the heart of the volcano. Looks like there's a passageway down there on the left. - And I bet this'll open it. - Who's gonna try? - Sure, it's a little hot. - You can say that again. Touch that lava and you'll turn into a pot roast. I wouldn't do it, that's for sure. It's pretty risky, indeed. There's no sign of lava on the upper walls, though. You're right. I'm going in. I'll lower myself down with a rope, I need you two to be ready to pull me up. Let me go, Rick. I'm way lighter than you. And I'm way more thievish. You wouldn't know what to do with all the mechanisms down there. Damn shame, but you're right. Amun-Ra, Sun god, listen to my plea! Yours is the glory of the skies! Yours is the power of fire! Grant my wish and let me use your sceptre to reunite our people! I will lead them back to the glory that was once ours! Be extra careful, Rick. Don't worry. - Careful. - All right. Nice and slow does it. - How are you faring, Rick? - So far so good. I can even breathe, but I don't think I'd last long down here. There's a stone mechanism here on the left, I think that's what we're looking for! Unbelievable! I can see another mechanism! Give me some more rope. Rick! Rick! Are you all right? Yeah! I think I've found the keyhole! We might have pulled this off. Yeah! It fits perfectly! Gimme a little more rope! There's a room with a series of huge stones resting on beams! They're probably a counterweight! I also see a lever! I'll try to unjam it! Be careful up there! I can't reach it! - Rick! You need more rope? - No! My leg's stuck! Let's pull him up! Stop pulling! Hope he can free himself alone. They're closing in, hurry! Get a move on, Rupert, or they'll catch you! Allow me a suggestion, Sir. You two go that way, while I'll go this way and draw them after me. - All right, but try not to get captured. - I'll do my best, Sir. I'll meet you in the temple. - Rick! Did you get loose? - Still trying to, dammit! It's them, I recognise their voices. Rick's in danger! Mahmoud, it's us! Allah be praised! Rick! - What happened? - His leg's trapped. - Rick! - He can't get loose. Leave me! - Rick! - We must do something! I'm going in. Don't give up, Rick! Hurry, Dean! Hello, old chap. Dean! Have you been miraculously healed or what? - It sure looks like it. - All the better. Careful now. - Ready? - Yes. - Keep pulling. - Is it broken? Incredible, it's still working after so many centuries. - Let's get out before the lava reaches us. - Yes. If we don't get out now, they'll find us cooked to perfection. Easy, he might be injured. How come you were paralysed and now you're climbing like an athlete? I have some holy friends in Lourdes. There, you made it. Allah helped us. Hey, look! The door's opening! My god... I wish the professor could see this. They must have been important people. High-priests and dignitaries, probably. It's exactly how the professor imagined it! I can't believe it... Don't touch anything, people. Well protected, I'd say. See those dishes and scales? They probably activate another mechanism like the one we encountered. If we remove the lid, it'll activate a self-destruction reaction, like the legend says. We could try cutting it. There's your sceptre, Dean. The symbol of Gilgamesh's might. Right in front of our eyes. For the first time in my life, I feel like stealing is a bad thing. Congratulations, Mr. Spear! You did a terrific job. I have often doubted about the existence of this temple, I admit. Thanks to you, the legend of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, has now become reality. Well done. Get away from there! Move! Make way for my master! This treasure belongs to my people, Mr. Spear. - Take them away! - At once, Master! Move it! Walk! Gilgamesh... Your kingdom will rise again. Give me strength, Amun! No! You got a problem with this, Mr. Spear? If you desecrate the tomb of Gilgamesh, this temple will collapse! You think we are barbarians because we dress like this? So stupid to believe all those superstitions? Do you think our clothes make us uncivilised? Where was your civilisation when our ancestors were building these temples? We were mighty when your people were still living in mud huts! And the evidence is all around us! You're the barbarians! You're the ones destroying the world! But I shall rule the world from now on! The temple will collapse, you must believe me! That's enough! You two help me! You others, shoot him if he opens his mouth again! Push! What's happening? It's the volcano! An earthquake! - Run! - Stop! Anybody who tries fleeing is a dead man! We'll leave only after I've taken the sceptre! - Who fired!? - It's me, Your Grace. Get down! Rick! We can't stay here! Cursed swine! Look out! Rupert, we must head to the exit! I'm doing my best, Sir! We must save him! Hurry, no time to waste! You'll never get out of here alive! That makes two of us, the temple's coming down. - Gilgamesh will protect me! - He won't do much against this disaster! Watch out! Look! This is what you'll become! Time to die! Shoot! Shoot him, Mahmoud! You'll pay for unleashing Gilgamesh's wrath! Rick, save yourself! The whole place is crumbling! - Rick! - Don't! Rick! Help! Help me! - Help! I'm burning! - Grab my hand! The curse came true... Rick! Run! What are you waiting for? Hurry! Honey! The sceptre! It's too late now, the whole place is going! Quick, let's get out of here! Hey, look! The tomb is intact! Come back, you'll never make it! Come on, let's get out of here! Come on, Carol, we gotta keep going! Hurry, the exit's over there! Quick, Miss Carol. - Grab my umbrella, Sir! - Thanks! What a close call! Even the other tribesmen are making a run for it. - I see. - One less thing to worry about. Hurry! This way! Hey, look over there! That's Roach! Stop pulling, dammit! You don't have to grab my ear to pull yourself up! I had to grab onto something, sorry! I didn't want to get stuck in that hole! Try having two tonnes pulling your ear down! Are you all right, Mahmoud? How did you get out of there? Lucky for us, a tunnel opened behind the tomb. We jumped in there and we were blown out like a cork from a bottle! The whole temple has sunk into lava. The legend about the tomb has come true. And now the sceptre is gone forever. I'd give a million pounds to get my hands on it. We would settle for twenty thousand pounds each. How does sitting on sixty thousand pounds feel, Mahmoud? It does feel magnificent, indeed. You could say that again. And you call yourselves honest thieves? Sixty thousand pounds for a sceptre. - I'd rather call you a... - ... shower of sons of bitches, Sir? Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
