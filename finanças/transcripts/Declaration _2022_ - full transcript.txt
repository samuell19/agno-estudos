Isn't this enough? Come on, do it properly, Reshmi. This is your speed?! Where is the skill video? Where is it? Pawan... copy this and give it back. Here, sign these forms. It's a declaration... stating that the documents you've submitted are all original. Just check if your passport numbers are correct. I'll fill in the rest. I just realized it this morning. Let me go this time, please. That hag sensed it right away, and still, she kept groping me. She probably enjoys it. Didn't you garnish this? Well, even finding anything in the market is a miracle nowadays. Mr. Ismail, how many more? Forty more... but don't take my word for it. I'm done. This is enough for one load. Just finish this one, man. Don't make the consignment lapse! Let's have some tea and finish this one. Tell them as well... or arrange a few loaders from elsewhere. The drivers won't do it. In one week, our loaders will test negative and be back. We're going to have tea. It's just raw material for the factory. That's it. He has a permit to enter daily. What's the issue, then? Dinesh sir, all that's fine, but even I need to follow the protocol, right? It's all chemicals, brother! Do you want to get all messed up or what? What's all this, Mr. Ismail? Make them understand. Sorry, sir. It's my mistake, sorry. - Come on, then. - Let's go. How is that your job, brother? You'll understand when you're my age. Once they let go of me, I'm not going to land another job. Ms. Sudha, my lot is full of rejects today. Didn't you hear what Mr. Suresh said? We need to reduce the pressure. I didn't hear that. How do you reduce it any further anyway? Go, ask him that, or move to another department. Sir, I have way too many rejects today. Didn't I ask everyone to reduce the air pressure yesterday, Reshmi? Please move me to the stripping unit, then. I don't know how to reduce the air pressure any further. I can't make that decision. Go and speak to the manager about this. Sir, I'm begging you... I don't know how to make that man understand. Ask him not to deduct the price of rejects from my salary. Everyone else is doing fine. Why do only you have so many defects? Let me see how you're doing it. Sir, I think the solution itself is faulty. How is that possible, Mr. Suresh? Everybody's using the same solution. Do you see anything wrong with them? Show me your hands. The other hand too. Do you see that? Why are you wearing a ring? Sir, it won't come off. Please tell him, sir. Sir, she says it won't come off. She has been wearing it all along. So, she's been flouting factory rules from the beginning?! And Mr. Suresh, you're clearly being supportive - of people from your own native place. - Not at all, sir. She is a really good worker. We've never had any issues with her. But now we do, right? This will have to be reported. You can't be wearing a ring here! It is against the rules! Sir, it's very difficult to remove it. - Is that so? - Yes. Then, leave the testing unit and work in the washing unit from tomorrow. San deep, get this one. Wait a second. Don't take it personally, but... if there was an inspection, they'd have fired you from your job. Also, the washing area is not very strict when it comes to imposing rules. Alright? Hareesh! Come in. I want my money back, Mohanan. You know that's not possible. You'll have to wait for the visa. I never said anything about a refund. We've been stuck here for eight months. At least don't cheat your own people. Who imagined all this would happen? You won't be able to go anywhere this year. Feel free to try it if you don't believe me. I don't know, help me out here. Stay put for now. At least you have a job. Imagine my situation. Don't worry, I'll call you. Is this a regular thing now? The bars are shut. So, just a little something. Mohanan, get up. - Get up. - Did you get our passports back? Not just the passports... but I'm also trying to get our money back. Get up, let's go. Come on. Aren't you going in tonight? Well, yes... once I manage to get him up. Shall I cook you something, then? Have dinner first. I'll eat out tonight. Lock the door. Watch your step. Wait. Come. How many times do I have to tell you to wear gloves while working? Reshmi... do I need to tell you separately? Ma'am, she doesn't have any. Come inside, I'll give it to you. Always keep them on without fail. I will. If you come across anything strange, immediately inform me. Ma'am, strange as in? As in, if the gloves don't look too good, or they have stains, or they've been torn, let me know immediately. Okay. - Am I clear? - Yes. Alright. Ma'am, shall I take these? Don't you touch them. I'll wash those myself. Something's wrong with that woman. Get a grip, girl. Don't fall for these types of guys. Let me see if he is willing to buy my kid a smart phone. - Where are you going? - I'll see you in a bit. I haven't misunderstood anything. I haven't seen anything like this here in the past 20 years. And Mr. Suresh, why are you supporting him? This should worry you more than me. Get your eyes tested, Ms. Smita. After a certain age, retirement is the best option. Got it? And now, if you have any more complaints or worries, we can talk it out in my cabin. Or just report it directly to the factory owner. Suresh sir, I'm pleading with you. Get the latex checked once again. Ms. Smita, think about it for a second. Production will have to be stopped. And please don't say such things in front of workers. I'll take care of this, don't worry. We'll make a decision together. Reshmi! - Is something wrong with the washing unit? - I'm not sure, sir. She asked me not to touch certain things. Hey! - What? - The loading workers are in quarantine. Turn off your phones and help us. Who the hell are you? Don't you know that drivers don't do loading work? Wait. The load stays here, then. If you want it, carry it yourself. - I've had enough. - Mr. Ismail! Who the fuck is this guy? - Whom are you swearing at, you cunt? - What did you say? - Get out of there! - Hey! - Bastards, I'll show you! - Asshole! Hareesh, they'll be staying with us for a few days. Have some breakfast before you go back to sleep. Can't he stay here? He has online classes to attend on Reshmi's phone. He can sit somewhere in our factory for a few days. See you. Okay. - Hello. - Yes, Guddu? Brother, what have you done? It's an absolute shit show on WhatsApp. What happened? You're asking me?! Why don't you check your WhatsApp? Yeah, alright. Guddu, what is going on? I'm the one who should be asking you that! Why did you make such a video? Which video? The one that Driver San dip has shared on the group. Check your WhatsApp. I deleted that I guess. Send it to me again. Brother, have you really no shame? Hey, watch your mouth. Just send me the video, okay? Just send it! Yeah. WHAT'S THE RATE, BROTHER? FIRE THOSE SCOUNDRELS FROM THE JOB! WHAT'S THE RATE? Mister, is this place shut? It's been shut since the lockdown. And the owner? Mohanan? Have you seen him around? He must have probably left town. What's the point of staying here now? Ma'am... I want to show you something. Close that door, quickly. And the blinds as well. - This is today's lot? - Yes, ma'am. Empty the boxes here. Let's see. These aren't from here. They're all used. Don't touch them. Listen... quickly take a video of all this on your phone. Just a moment. Mohanan! Hide these gloves, quickly! Reshmi, your phone! Stay with the kid. Open the door. Why have you shut the door? What happened, Dinesh sir? Nothing, I need to talk to Reshmi. Come to my cabin. Alone. Think harder. You haven't given it to anyone, have you? Okay, I'll call you later. That's it. The computer is at his home. It's not him. That's what you're saying. Why should I believe you? Aren't the original videos with you? What if it got leaked some other way? I'm going to file a complaint. You need to come with me. Why should I? I'm not running an illegal business here. This is your problem, not mine. You think you can get away that easily, you scumbag?! Hands off, motherfucker! Go ask that wife of yours! When did you join this company? Eight months ago, sir. And your husband? First, I came here. Then, my husband came. Where was he before this? In Kerala. Tell me this... did the two of you shoot a video here? You use your cell phone during work hours?! No, sir. What? Where's your cell phone? In the locker room. Give me your number. Give me your number! We are idiots, right? They think we don't know anything! What did you shoot here? Sir, we shot a skill video for our visa application. Skill video... really? Who shot it? My husband did. Husband? He's doing the night shift, right? Skill video! They think we are all fucking idiots! This is your skill video?! Tell me! Is this it? How can that be me? How did our videos get leaked? I don't know. Might be from the agency. Why is this happening to us? We left everything back home... for what? Come, let's go to the police station. Why? Won't they look at me the same way? What does it matter? We have to prove our stance. I'm not going anywhere anymore. I want to go back home. That doesn't change anything, Reshmi! The two of us know it's not you. We need to report it. Or this will never end. Where is that memory card? In my phone. He drinks and beats up my daughter every day! Asking for an AC, a fridge, a car, - and gold! - Don't yell. Pandey, what's this ruckus? - My daughter is really upset! - Alright, stop yelling. It's been five days since I filed a complaint! - Keep quiet now. Let her speak. - My husband harasses me... Reshmi Hareesh! Neelam Rubber Factory! Are you two from Kerala? Yes. Nowadays, people go to the south looking for job opportunities. How did you two end up here? Sir, we're trying to go abroad. Going abroad is a bit easier from here. I get it. So, the two of you are just passing by here. Pandey, is that other person here? - Sir, he's outside. I'll go get him. - No, wait here. Send him in. Go inside. So, Mr. Mohan... Yes, sir. All of you hail from the same place, right? Yes, sir. Then, just sit down and reach a compromise among yourselves. Sir, my wife is involved in this. How can I compromise? So, you're not involved?! Mr. Mohan, you tell me from the start. What happened? Sir, I run a visa agency, Indus Visa Services. Near Dadri Main Road. - Since the past 12 years... - I have all your details here. Why don't you get straight to the point? This couple's video has been leaked from your office. That's the complaint we've received. Sir, my legal policy is very clear. Only after receiving a declaration do I ask for videos from the client... which I only use for finding sponsors. So, how many sponsors have you found until now? None, sir. The lockdown started. Then, all the embassies also shut down. So, then, you just sold the video. That too with that obscene bit. I swear I did not. Why would I, sir? This is my bread and butter. Just look at my track record. - Service Tax, GST... - It's all here, all of it. Where can I find that video? This has both, right? I mean, your version, and that other non-veg version. Mr. Mohan. - Yes, sir? - You may leave. Okay, sir. - If need be, we'll call you again. - Okay, sir. Give your address and number on the way out. Yes, sir. Both your phones are being confiscated by the Noida Police. For verification. Sir, we are the complainants. - What kind of legal system is this... - Shut up! You shot those first two videos, right? And your wife was acting in it. So, what are you bawling about? This is part of the evidence! There's no cyber-wing here. We'll have to send these to Lucknow. - Komal! - Yes, sir? Get her interrogated separately. Then, send her for a medical checkup. Sir, what's happening here? We gave the complaint! - And now, you're questioning us?! - We get many such cases here. Domestic abuse... resulting from dowry, food, and sex! How would we know if you've shot this together or if this is something else? - Sir, please, talk respectfully. - That's enough. Let's just leave. Sir, this is wrong. Don't do this. Have you no shame, asshole? Making lewd videos with your wife! Pandey, let it be. Go, wait outside. Your wife will be back after her interrogation and medical checkup. - Make him sit outside. - Yes, sir. NOIDA POLICE Doctor! Take her clothes off, please. Take your phones. - Mr. Mohan. - Yes, sir. Please make him understand and just get this over with! I'll talk to him, sir. Come. He's saying that the video was leaked from the factory itself. He says you should withdraw the complaint. What does that mean? It means if they start an investigation, you'll lose your jobs. That doesn't matter now. We moved to Delhi hoping to go somewhere better... and that's not going to happen. Let them investigate. We'll get to the bottom of this. He says the bottom line is going to be that it was your wife. You keep repeating the same damn thing! I told you it's not her! Hey! You weren't called here to fight. You're here to end it. He just won't agree, sir. This blow job video is from the factory itself. Now, I'm not the one who has to go and work there. Right? If an investigation takes place, they'll question your wife. Is that fine? I tried to make you understand... that these things often happen here in UP. Blackmailing, murder, suicide... this is no different. You do one thing, sit your wife down... and talk to her calmly and lovingly. Sooner or later, she'll tell you. And that will resolve things. Yeah, Komal? Oh, okay. Alright. I'll send her husband. Yeah. Her medical checkup is done. She's totally fine. Well... get this over with. Okay? And yes... we're not going to file an FIR. Come sometime tomorrow and take back your complaint. Alright? - Mr. Mohan. - Yes, sir. - Drop them off at their place. - Okay, sir. I'll do that. Sir, here, keep this. Oh, come on! She didn't tell me about her periods. I didn't know she was a Malayali, either. You can leave once the drip finishes. I'll go back to my place tonight. It must be okay by now. You'd better stay here for a few days. I'll wash them. Let it be. Someone tested positive in Sujaya's room. That's why I asked her to stay back. You also don't go to work for a few days. It would've been better if we had got COVID and just stayed here. Yeah, and for how long? Let's just leave all this... and go back to Kerala. You think that's how it works?! Do you even know how much we've spent on that visa? We'll have to live in shame no matter where we go. The only way out is to die! Are you ready? Hareesh, go, I'll do the dishes. Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean all that. What are we guilty of if we've done nothing wrong? Don't withdraw the complaint. Let the truth come out whenever it may. What about our phones? Did you get them back? No. Let them be done with it. SMITA: DON'T DELETE THAT VIDEO AT ANY COST, RESHMI. SMITA: DON'T DELETE THAT VIDEO AT ANY COST, RESHMI. - Smita madam! - Yes, Ismail? Could you step out with me for a few minutes? I'll be back in some time. Let's go. In fact, I want the police to come here and conduct an inquiry... but they should not question Reshmi but the system here. That video is the evidence that we have to show the police. And that manager, Dinesh, isn't going to last very long now. He is a total fraud! He is the one that needs to be investigated. When is Reshmi coming back to work? It'd be better if she doesn't resume work for a few days. We don't know who is behind all this. Ismail, let's go, then. I've got work to do. And yes, tell Reshmi to keep that video safe. Let's go. Doesn't San dip drive this truck? What happened? I drive it during the day, and San dip drives it at night. What's wrong? San dip drives it at night. He didn't tell me his address. Let's come back tonight. - Aren't you working the night shift? - I'll take the day off. Let's find a way to end this. How can I leave you alone? - I'll do this by myself. - No, I'll come with you. Where's Reshmi? Talking to her mother. Where is Auntie's phone? Smita madam told her that she met you. Auntie will charge it and give it to you, okay? Why do you need it right now? Here. What did the cops say? That the case is pointless. There's no point in pursuing it. Let's not. Mom is really concerned about us. Let's go back. We'll look for work there. Okay? Let me think about it. You told Mom everything?! - Are you not having dinner? - No, Ismail is waiting downstairs. Why don't you call him too? There's enough food here. Hareesh, what are you doing? Don't go there! Don't go there! - Who the fuck... - Where did you get that video? Tell me! - Hareesh, stop it! - Go and ask your whore! I've seen her go to the other unit myself! - Stop! - When did you see her? When? When they'd stopped me at the gate, you bastard! All of you were also there! Don't you remember, Ismail? - Don't listen to him, man! - The next time you come to pick a fight, I'll bury you alive, motherfucker! Stay within your limits! Bloody South-Indian! Who the hell was that? No one. Just laborers from our factory. Why did you let that faggot go? You should have used rods on him! Fuck it. My hands are enough for him. Let it be. Come on, let's off-load the stuff. Sujaya is here. Hareesh... Sujaya is asleep. Let's move outside. This is a fucking mess, Ismail! I've always said that the ingest needs to be changed! Not just the latex, sir. Many other things are being brought in without our knowledge. This is the day when Sandip's truck entered here. - Date? - November 30. - Shift? - Morning shift. This isn't our stock, Ismail. We haven't ordered anything either. It's all used, sir. There are people here who knowingly wash and repack these. You need to do something about this. It'd be a shame if others find out about this. Lunch is ready, go freshen up. Reshmi. Come here. It will overcook, dear. Go and bathe first. Come here, I said. What is it? Why did you go to B-block? What do you mean? I'm not even going to work nowadays. When you did, why did you go to B-block? What work do I have in B-block? Why would I go there? Reshmi, don't lie to me! That video was shot in the beading station of B-block. People have seen you go there. What is this behavior, Hareesh? Are you still thinking about that? I didn't go to B-block! How dare you fucking lie to me! Tell me! You liar! Who is this then? Who is it? I was on my period. I'd gone to the bathroom. Don't hit me! Stop hitting me! - Everybody in the factory knows! - Stop it! Why did you whore yourself out? I'm leaving! I've had enough! Open it! Why did you do this to me? I'm leaving, Hareesh. I'm done. You just don't get it! I'm leaving! Get some rest now. I'll get something to eat. After that, take your medicines. Come on. What is it, Hareesh? No, she'll stay here. She's not coming back. Okay, then. We'll be back in some time. Try to get some sleep. Come here. She'll be here for a few days. Don't trouble her. - How are you doing? - I'm fine, ma'am. Shut that door completely. - You've brought your phone, right? - Yes. Take it out. Show him the video. This is a serious issue, ma'am. But how can we present this video as proof? I've got the evidence as well. I knew I'd have to show you a sample. Why didn't you tell me all this earlier? Reshmi, didn't I ask you long ago if there was any problem here? Sir, I've been telling you for so long, but you never believed me. Why are you scolding her? Reshmi... what happened? Who did this? Let's go to a hospital. It's okay. I fell in the bathroom. Yes, Hareesh. What's the matter? Come in. Tell me. Sir, could you please move me to B-block? Why? What's wrong with the main unit? Okay, now I get it. Marriage is a whirlwind that will knock the wind out of you! Do one thing. Supervise the stripping unit. Okay? - Go, sign the register. - Okay. Tell me something. It was you who shot that video, right? Wear these, quickly. Wear it. Here, wear this. Come on, wear it. Yes, Mr. Suresh. How many of these lots have come here? Four, as of now, sir. At first, I had my doubts, but after seeing this, I informed Suresh sir. Who saw these first? You did well. Good job. Don't talk about this to anyone, okay? Give the entry dates of these lots to Suresh. And Suresh, if any of the consignments haven't left already, call them back. - Okay, sir. - Okay? - Yes. - What do you think? Is Dinesh involved in this? - Sir, Dinesh's... - Without a doubt, sir. Even the latex is faulty. The workers who saw everything happen, bring them to my cabin. First, he went to Neo Hospital on Dadri Main Road. Around... What was the time? Around 1:30 a.m. He loaded medical waste, I think. Quite a lot of it. Do we... supply to this Neo Hospital? Not directly, sir, but through distributors, maybe. And then? Then to Ghaziabad. To a warehouse in a secluded area. Do you know which sector? Once we're close by, we will recognize it, yeah? Yes, sir. Informing the police right away will cause trouble. The factory will bear the brunt. So, let us go now and inquire. Let's find out whether they too are involved in this or not. Alright, sir, that makes sense. What should I tell Dinesh? Nothing at all. What's the point? All this stays between us. Alright, sir. Ismail... you come along with us. I will, sir. I was the one driving that day. I know the place. Yeah? Well, then, let's go. Let's leave now. Take this left. Was this the gate, Hareesh? It was the back gate, sir. That was the pickup spot. Mr. Suresh... let's meet the hospital PRO. We might get to know something. Okay, sir. Hareesh, wait right here. Please stay in the car. I need to use the toilet. Where's the other place, Hareesh? Ghaziabad. Let's go. Yeah, we're on the way. Who knows! We'll only know that once we get there. Yes, Suresh is here. I'll call you later. Okay. Take a right here. Take a left. Hareesh, are you sure it's here? Yes, sir. It's the next right. A bit further ahead. Turn right here. The road's quite bad here, sir. The place is on that side of the wall. We'd better walk there instead of taking the car. Sir, this place doesn't seem safe. Should I inform the nearest station? No, let it be. Let's go and have a look first. Listen, don't turn off the car, and keep the headlights on. Let's go, Suresh. Hareesh! Hey! I did not know that you'd moved out. If there's an issue, you should speak to us. Don't simply suppress everything within yourself. Hareesh P. V.! Come on. Mr. Tiwari, are you sure you don't want to file a complaint? I'll give it to you in writing, sir. It was an accident. You can take Mr. Bhatia's statement tomorrow. Sign here and write down your address, please. Ismail, you go ahead. I'll drop them off. Thank you, Mr. Tiwari. What do you think you are doing? What else should I do, sir? - Keep quiet despite knowing everything?! - It's all in your head. Reshmi has nothing to do with this. Is that why she came to get me out? Sir, let me get down here. I can't listen to this anymore. - Sir... - Hareesh... listen carefully. Kailash sir may have agreed not to file a case... but if Reshmi chooses to file a complaint for the way you've tortured her, you'll go right back in. Without bail. Where to, sir? The factory. This is the locker that belonged to that girl. She worked here for four months in the stripping unit. From February 2019 to the end of July 2019. By the end of July, we had to let her go. Her corpse was found after a few days. Nobody has used this locker after that. Kailash sir's younger brother is the one who shot that video. Before Dinesh joined, he had been the one in charge here. He was nothing but trouble. No one had really watched this video... so it just faded away. Nobody really expected all this would come back to haunt us again. You could've told us this earlier. How could I, Hareesh? I was also involved in reaching a compromise with her family. Not many here know about this. I also removed one of the CCTV cameras in that other unit. How did she die? Did they kill her? After that incident, madam had a talk with that girl... and then fired her from the job. Unable to bear all this, she probably killed herself. Nobody knows. In a way, I'm also involved. Withdraw your complaint. Whatever you want in return, the company will agree to it. That's my fate. Back then, and even now, I am the mediator. Tomorrow, by 10:00 a.m., madam will be there at the office. By then, talk among yourselves and reach a firm decision. Try not to fuck me over. Reshmi... Reshmi! Reshmi! Reshmi! We finally did it! Ready? Shall we go in? Come inside. Suresh sir said that the two of you are trying to move abroad. She's proposing this offer understanding the situation you two are in. With your best interests in mind. We can understand that this has been a bad time for the two of you. And we don't want any more trouble coming your way from our side. Our Malaysian factory has new openings. I'd like to move both of you there. Since this is a direct recruitment, they will take care of your air tickets and all other needs. Isn't this what the two of you have been working so hard for? That's all we want, sir. The sooner, the better. - He is ready to accept the offer, ma'am. - Alright. All the details are in here. Just fill out all the forms and hand them over to him. And for whatever visa formalities remain, our travel agent will contact you. But before that, you'll have to withdraw your complaint from the station. And immediately after that, we'll start processing the documents. Do you agree? We can clear that today itself, Hareesh. Reshmi doesn't even need to be there. An affidavit will do. We'll clear it today itself, ma'am. I can't do that, sir. Why, Reshmi? What do you want, then? I want a declaration put up on the notice board stating that I'm not the person in the video. Can you do that? What good will that do? This is the kind of life you've always wished for. Sponsored by the factory! But right now, I'm an employee here. People still see me as the girl in that video. If you want me to withdraw the complaint I want that declaration put up, sir. Reshmi, just keep quiet... What are you fighting about now? Didn't I tell you to talk things through before coming here? Sir, she is speaking nonsense! Madam, we accept the offer. I'm the one who suffered, sir. I can't agree with all this so easily. How have you suffered? - I haven't been able to sleep for days! - Hey, stop it. Reshmi, tell me. What is it that you want? I want this resolved, sir. I want to visit that girl's home... and show my husband that I am not the person in the video. I already know that, Reshmi! There's no need for all this! But I want it. Only then will I sign anything. Here, right? You all go ahead. I'll be right here. Let's go. Do not speak to anyone here. If anybody asks anything, I'll do the talking. - Namaste, madam! - Namaste. If you'd called me, I'd have come to get you. No, that's alright. I just wanted to meet Mr. Harilal. Come. Watch your step. Dear, go and get your father quickly. - Uncle! - Dad! - Uncle Hari! - Dad! Madam is here. - Namaste, madam. Please come. - Namaste, how are you? I'm absolutely fine. She's from our factory. She used to work with Poonam. Now that she's moving abroad for work, she wanted to come and meet all of you. - Listen, get some water! - No, it's okay. Thanks. Isn't the renovation over? Because of COVID, we couldn't finish it. If there's anything you need, please tell Deepak about it. - Sure, I will tell him. - Yeah. How is your younger daughter doing? I won't sign it, Hareesh. What is it now, Reshmi? Do you really know how that girl died? I couldn't bear the look in her mother's eyes! Somebody we never knew died, so what? This job is just a price they are paying for her death. It's a sin to accept it. I can't do it. Reshmi... Reshmi! Reshmi, I'm begging you. We'll never get another opportunity like this. Like her family did? How can one live like this? People do things out of desperation! What has this got to do with us? Don't you wish to start living now at least? A job for us as a bribe to cover up her death! Isn't that what this is? I'm ready to sign it for you... but I don't want any of it. What's the matter, Hareesh? Nothing, madam. There is a small misunderstanding. I'll withdraw the complaint today. Make the remaining arrangements, please. They might not agree. What's the problem? Didn't she meet them? Something's going on between the two of them. I couldn't understand what it is. I tried to ask Hareesh, but... He did ask me to arrange the remaining documents. Let's see.
