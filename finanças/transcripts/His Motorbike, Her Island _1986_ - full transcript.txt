My day-to-day life at that time was a complete mess. I can't say it was the fault of youth. I was a student at a music college, but I had a part-time job delivering copy. A certain girl referred me to it, and I was extremely well-suited to the job. Some punk like you had a wreck. Flirting with his girl and not watching the road. Lucky he's not dead. This poor old man's gonna be though. Listen! Get it there in an hour! You're fired if you don't! The accident outline and the film. Thanks. Hello, hello. Yeah. Yeah. What? When? This morning? Did you check around? Please excuse me. Just cigarettes? Cheeky. Thank you. Thanks. - Thanks. - Hey, come here! You said you'd fix it before the last case! I'm gonna be late! Whatever. Hey, Hashimoto. Yeah? Take responsibility for my sister. - What do you mean? - What are you gonna do? I didn't say you could break up with her. It's between Fuyumi-San and I. Shut up! You put the moves on her. She was a virgin. She wouldn't have ridden off with someone unless they put the moves on her. I'll give you two or three days, got it? Think hard!

This story is one of those monochrome dreams. What's up? Sorry. It was like she was carried there by the wind. Summer would arrive very soon. What's up? It's beautiful. It was gonna crush you. It was so beautiful that I had to touch it. So what do you call it? A motorbike. Ka-wa-sa-ki. 650RSW3. Want some? No thanks. How about some tea? It's cold. Is that right? Kawasaki-San! Where are you from? Tokyo. Did you ride that Kawasaki? I did. You did. I'll send you the pictures. That's alright. But they've got both you and the bike. Probably out of focus. Where are you heading today? Looking for the wind, and then taking a nap. I actually wanted to stay with her a bit longer, but I took off on my bike. This trip was for me to think about another girl. Gotta do it. Please let me ride on the back of that big bike! -Fuyumi Sawada I got your letter, Fuyumi. You can ride if you want. It's a Kawasaki 650RSW3. Are you Hashimoto-San? I'm Fuyumi. Wow. Thanks for the note. - Why do you want to ride a motorbike? - I just do. Not too big? My brother has a Kawasaki too. - What model? - 650-W1. - Why can't you ride with him? - There's no way he'd let me touch it. - Alright. You can ride. - Really? I'm glad. I was really happy when I got your note. How old's your brother? Twenty-seven. He uses his motorbike for work. - How so? - He's a copy delivery man. Delivery man? What do you mean? He started a company with his friends. See ya! Damn that asshole! Hop off! Undress! Hurry up! Take 'em off! - Underwear too! - No! Undress! Whatever! Stay here. Wait... wait... What should we do? I dunno. What do you want to do? Whatever you want. Be gentle. What's wrong? Regret it? Don't cry then! It's just... I thought I would be smiling. I thought I'd smile, but I'm crying. Then don't try to smile. - But... - You've been crying over an hour already. Cut it out. Come on, don't cry. I'll be gentle. Really? Re-Al-ly. Then, is it alright to fall in love? Yeah. You can fall in love. Gotta do it. It's really coming down. Sorry! Oh?! Taking a bath after your nap? Well... What about the Kawasaki? It's... outside. Won't it get soaked? Totally. How sad. I'm taking the Koumi line tomorrow. Yeah? All the way from Komoro to Kobuchizawa. Then comes the Chuo Main Line. You've taken it? Nope. Well, I'm getting out. Two happy coincidences... it felt just like I was in a story. Hey. Where will you go now? - Looking for the wind again? - Something like that. I'm staying at an inn nearby. - Want me to take you? - On the Kawasaki? My gift to you. This is great! The best! - Thank you. - See ya. What were you saying before? I said, 'This is great!" Oh. - I'll send you the pictures. - Right. The painful trip turned into a happy memory. It allowed me to get over my broken heart. I went back to Tokyo to break up with Fuyumi. I just want to be with you. So I ended up having to duel her brother. I thought it was a bit childish, but so be it. It's a bit early, but wanna get started? Well? Fine with me. Whatever happens, I don't want to hear any complaints, got it? Alright. Somehow I managed to win. Going up against the boss is saying farewell to your job. But since it was a duel with no grudges there was no need for me to quit. That's what Fuyumi's brother said afterwards. I heard it from Fuyumi herself. Michikusa Rain Wind Storm Lightning I saw Fuyumi again a week after the duel. I went to meet the girl I'd broken up with. It already seemed like ancient history. Yo. Doing well? Yes. Fuyumi was the one who called me to meet. To choose Michikusa, a place where we had so many memories... that was just like her. I had taken Fuyumi to the hospital. She came to return the money for her brother's medical bills. My brother said to pay you back. But a man can't take back something once it's given. Listen up everyone! I'm paying the rest of the tabs! It's a party! Everything's on me tonight! It's goodbye to this place, too. You can come back anytime. Don't worry about me. No, that's alright. Goodbye to the motorbike as well. You got some good practice for riding by yourself. No, I... I was happy just riding behind you. If we happen to meet again somewhere... ...will you say hello? I will. But what if you're on your motorbike? You can wave then. Right. What if it's late? How late? What would you say at 11? I'd say good night. What a party. Everything I have was saved little by little for a brighter tomorrow. 510,000 yen. I took on more than I could handle But you were there to hold me up Wow, she's good. That girl can sing. That song... Huh? What about it? Sometimes Fuyumi would write lyrics in a notebook while I wrote her songs. It's sentimental just like you. Idiot! Things like that are meant to be treasured. I bought a diary Blue blots of sadness Why'd you break up with a great girl like her? It was boring. All she knew was crying and cooking. A guy couldn't do better, could he? And I... I couldn't be yours Go after her. If you don't, I will. Do what you want. You're supposed to stand up and say something at a time like this. That was a bit cruel, Ko. Also... You need to take all this money back. You really love your motorbike. I knew it from the moment I saw it. I was so jealous. To be loved to that degree... Why do you ride? The heart is a willful thing. By the time something from the past is buried, another story has already begun. Because I'm bored. And because I'm bored, I do everything my way. I cheat my way through it all. Even music. Riding the motorbike is the only thing I couldn't cheat my way through. When you do that, it comes back on you in the end. Always. So I ride. I'm bored too. Somehow I felt it clearly after reading your letter. My life is the same old same old. I guess it's fine if you can live with that, but that seems so far away from where I am now. What should I do? - Oh? You're home? - I'm here! I thought I'd try giving you a call. Where are you? Nishinomiya. Violet Apartments? - You knew that off the top of your head? - Of course I did. Hey, how do you read your name? Isao? Ko. I'm Miiyo. Right. I shortened Miyoko to Miiyo. I see. It's got a nice sound. Ko. What are you doing? Getting undressed. I'm naked right now! It's so hot. - But autumn's coming early this year. - Yeah? - It's awful. - Why? - Because summer's the best. - I agree! How old are you, Miiyo? - I just turned twenty-two. - We're the same age, too. - Today's my birthday. - How about that! Time sure does fly. Happy birthday! - Should I sing you a song? - Sing! Hold on. I'm riding, yeah, looking for the wind I am light, yeah, I am sound When you and I ride together The whole world gently shines We are the wind - I love you - I love you That's beautiful! What do you call it? 'The Song of the Wind." I just wrote it. I just thought of something good too. What is it? Want to come to my island? Your island? My island in the Inland Sea. I'm going home for Obon soon. An island? Why not show your Kawasaki the Bon dance? Yeah. To tell the truth, I didn't yet long for her at that time. What I longed for was that island. Ko! Ko! Ko! Ko! Ko! Ko! - You really came on the Kawasaki, huh? - That's right. What are you drinking? Club soda. For some reason I feel like drinking it in the summer. What a sound. The sound of love. Life on the island was fun. I lost myself in it before I knew it. I felt completely alive. My greatest pleasure was putting Miiyo on the motorbike. She said she only had her small-size license from when she was 16, but she had potential. I felt very close to this strange girl. That's the first time I've driven a 650cc! What a thrill! - You were great. - Really? - The important thing's not being afraid. - But I was. I'm not used to it yet. Keep riding. You can use the throttle a bit more. OK. Wow! That good? - Yeah, from what I've seen. - Teach me more! - The writing on the tank... - Oh, Kawasaki? - Read the first three letters. - K, A, W. Read it like English. Kao... Kou... My name! On such a small island, the priest can't get by on donations. He's the principal of the elementary school too. - Relax. - Alright. Have a drink. Thank you. Sure is hard to make a living. I'll pour. What a shame that Miyoko's mother died when she was young. Maybe I shouldn't have spoiled her so much. Now she's spoiled rotten. Sorry I'm spoiled. Well, they say clothes make the man. Right, dear? You look just like her... - Going to the Bon dance? - Yeah. Let's go, Ko! Alright, I'll go too! Let's go, let's go! Ko, come on! Let's go, Miyoko! Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go! Hey, let me sing! Sure! Come on, dance! - That's alright. I'll just watch. - You can't just watch! What's that? The people who were born, lived, and died on this island. My mother is there too. - Is this the pilgrim's song? - That's right. - You dance to the pilgrim's song? - We do. Obon's the one time a year the dead return to this world. We have to welcome them with a lively song and dance. - Miiyo! - Huh? I totally understand why you are the way you are. Why? Because you were raised in a place that dances to the pilgrim's song. I'm carefree? It's great! It's already been three days. You're going home tomorrow, aren't you? Time sure does fly. We'll be old before we know it. Ko, you really love your Kawasaki motorbike, right? I do. I was so jealous the first time I saw it in Shinshu. - It was written on your face. - On my whole body! - It's my sweetheart. - And me? - You're beautiful. - That's it? It's love. Don't be jealous. You're no match for 53 horsepower. I want to be able to ride it. You have your 125cc license, so your mid-size is next. Then the 750cc. Think I can do it? Yeah, I know you've got it in you. You think so? I do. Now it's perfect. Sleep with me. My time on the island passed in the blink of an eye. It was such a short summer. Don't zone out and drop it! - What happened? - Uh, well... Zoning out because summer's over? Sawada-San! Don't say a word. Move your body like this. There's no bad blood anymore. Fuyumi left. I'm already used to being alone. Hello? Sure. Ko, it's for you. Thanks. Miiyo! An unusual autumn began. A very long and strange autumn. It's right here. Ah, that's right. I gave you a spare key. Been a long time since I've been here. It's so dreary. - My heart is full, though. - What the hell does that mean? Thought I'd put on a record, but you don't have anything good. Why do you only have Chopin? I had more, but everyone took them. This is all that's left? Yep. That's perfect. You were always a romantic. - I'm a pragmatist. - Oh, shut up. Would a pragmatist deliver copy on a Kawasaki W3? I guess you don't mind that it's hard to use. I'm Miyoko Shiraishi. Keiichi Ogawa. - So what brings you here? - I need to talk to you. - About what? - I'm writing a song for graduation. - Yeah? - What about you? I'm failing, so I'll have to repeat a year. It's called Sunday Driver. It's about a guy obsessed with motorbikes. This guy goes on Sunday drives on four boring old wheels. He keeps seeing this motorbike. It's always the same one. Eventually he starts longing for it. He ends up leaving his lover behind so he can fly off on that motorbike. - So I've got a favor to ask. - What is it? It's not a big deal. You hungry? Yeah. - Let's go eat. - I'm starving too. Alright, we'll wait downstairs while you get changed. Who's she? A friend. - But you and I are friends. - Can't compare the two. What happened to the girl from last year? - The girl you were with in Shinshu. - She got married. So you got dumped. No way! Anything now? - There's a girl. - What's she like? She's just your average girl. And what's average? She's the boring type. - What about your girl? - Mine? I don't even know if she thinks I'm her man. Whatever she thinks is fine, right? Yeah, so don't say that she's my girl. We're both just trying to escape boredom. It's like we're walking on a tightrope above it. That's how it is, huh? That's just how girls are. If they weren't... it would just be a seesaw game of trying to love and be loved. Thanks for waiting. So where are we going? - Hmm... - How about Michikusa? Michikusa, huh? It's been a long time. Michikusa? Where the music school students go. - I wanna go! - Yeah. I took on more than I could handle Hey! What's up? You said I was lighter than expected Three glasses! Changed the color of my lipstick, cut my fingernails To record those days full of love I bought a diary - Surprised? - Yep. I persuaded her to be our exclusive singer. Today's her first day. Can I get an onion pizza? - One for me too. - Me too. And you... You weren't mine And I... I couldn't be yours Great song, huh? I wrote the music and gave it a title. "Sunshine Girl." Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm Miiyo. I just came to Tokyo today. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Fuyumi. Heading out? It's 3,500 yen. Why don't we toast the new beginnings for these two beautiful girls? - Cheers! - Cheers! So what did you think of "Sunshine Girl?" A lot different from my version. The music changes with the creator. Sorry for the wait. The girl changes as well. Ko, what was your version of "Sunshine Girl" like? I can't remember. I have the sheet music. Well then, why don't I sing it? You did it? I did it. That night? That night. We live together now. I took on more than I could handle But you were there to hold me up You said I was lighter than expected As you held me tightly - She's not bad, is she? - She's not bad. Still crying? Not at all. Cooking? Of course. To record those days full of love Now I understand why you left me behind. You were looking for a girl like her. She's a great girl. Hearts change as well And you... You weren't mine And I... I couldn't be yours So what are we doing? Just shut up for about two hours and stay behind me. I'll pick out cars. We'll pull up beside them when there's not much traffic, then I'll take out the right side mirrors. Get behind me after I do it so they'll have trouble remembering the plate number. Why are we doing this? I ended up wanting to try it as I was writing the song. I see. Don't run over them after they fly off, or you'll go flying too. Got it. Wasn't that fun? Are you inspired now? Plenty. Miiyo! I think I was pressing too hard on the shifter. I mis-shifted four times. Miiyo, you... I was behind you the whole time. I knew my first time riding through Tokyo would be scary. You idiot! Didn't you say you only had your small-size license? So why are you riding a 250cc? - Don't you know how dangerous that is? - Sorry! I made sure she was capable before we met up. She was great. I wouldn't have let her if it was dangerous. The helmet and motorbike are mine. - When did you plan this? - Yesterday. It's alright, she's fine. It's not alright! Let's head inside. Hey! Well, I'm going to go warm up. Welcome. - What? - Look. I got it in Nishinomiya last month. Mid-size license. I said I wanted to ride with you. Let's go outside. In Shinshu... When I saw you on top of that Kawasaki... I was so jealous. I envied that Kawasaki. I wanted to ride it myself. And I wanted to be loved as much as that Kawasaki. Miiyo... Sorry about before. I went to a driving school as soon as I got back from Shinshu. Motorbikes were the only things that weren't boring, just like you said in your letter. Let's go touring together. Really? It's the perfect season. I'm so happy! The R takes curves in a similar way. It's different when you have a blind curve though. Got it. Don't fly into the curves either. Too much throttle? Downshift. It's better to be in a low gear than high. Why? It's easier to accelerate if something happens. Enter the curb slowly, then accelerate to an appropriate speed as you come out. OK. You're doing pretty well. Really? I want to ride that Kawasaki soon. Be patient, be patient. Not happening on that mid-size license. Your island was great, Miiyo. Of course. - But why do you say that? - It's wide-open. - The island? - Right. But it's tiny. - It's surrounded by the sea, so it's open. - Why is that good? If a place isn't, then sometimes the wind stops completely. Is the wind blowing now? It is. The storm is raging. Everyone performed for our sakes. Those secret words - I love you - I love you Ko, why I am here? I wanted to ask you the same thing. Our tent is right over there. And inside is our sleeping bag. Let's lie down. Then we can do it. Yeah! Soon after that we were at the racetrack with Fuyumi's brother's group. Want to ride this one? - Why don't you give it a try? - Really? Upshift at 3000 rpm to keep it at 1500. Cut into the curves, but don't lean too much. Here! Alright. There you go! That's a good time. It's so powerful! - You look like you haven't had enough yet. - I haven't. Alright, one more lap. Fly! I got a call from Fuyumi the other day. She said she's seeing a guy named Ogawa. Never met him. But I could tell from her voice that she was doing well. She rides beautifully. How long has she been riding? About three months. Three months? She got her mid-size license at the end of the summer. She's gonna die. She's one of those motorbike prodigies. People like you just don't have the gift. If you don't want to kill her, then get her off of them. Ko, when can I get my 750cc license? Beginning of spring. Ugh! I want it now. You should slow down. I want it now. - No way. - Why not? It's alright if you don't understand. You'll have it in time for summer touring. I hate the rain. - Why? - You can't teach me. - The rain is nice. - Why? I don't get to be with you like this very often. Hello? What?! I'm on my way. Work? Murata-San was in an accident. I'm going to deliver the copy for him. It's nearby, so I'll take the 250cc. - Take care. - Yeah. What are you doing? What are you doing riding without your license? I wanted to ride it. You won't let me ride it here with you at all. - I've been busy with work. - You have not! You don't like me riding motorbikes! What?! You're jealous because I'm crazy about motorbikes. Idiot! Wearing a leather jacket out in the fucking rain... Take it off! Idiot! Why, you! You want to ride motorbikes that much? I do. You're gonna die. I love the Kawasaki. I wouldn't have any regrets. Get it. Your 750cc license. Six months passed. A lot of things can happen in six months. First, Ogawa's baby began to grow in Fuyumi's belly. And after that, Miiyo left. She had appeared out of nowhere, so it was no surprise that she disappeared just as suddenly. But my Kawasaki went missing along with her. It seemed she was going to get her 750cc license. She was going to do it alone. It's like the wind has stopped completely. I think I'll go back to my island. That was Miiyo's farewell letter. It was almost summer, and I was irritated. But for some reason I hesitated. Asshole! Hey! What are you doing? Watch where you're going! You asshole! Huh? - Come on! Get out here! - Quit fucking around, dumb-ass! Come on! - Stop! - My arm! My arm! My arm! Come on! Forgive us! Forgive us! Please forgive us! Ow! Get in there! - Help! - Help us! We've ridden this way many times. Yeah. Feels like it's been a long time. It does. Why do you think that is? It's been years. You've been acting weird lately, Ko. You were finally in love with that one girl. That was all there was to it. Oh, thanks. I'll do it. I got a package from Miiyo yesterday. There were clothes for the baby inside. And a short letter. Baby clothes? It's already midsummer on my island. The sun is shining so brightly. The wind feels lovely. The Kawasaki and I are both very well. Best wishes to the baby in your belly and Papa. She didn't write anything about you. But it felt like it was meant for you somehow. Ko... Leaving me behind may have given you freedom. But it seems like being separated from Miiyo has taken it away. Where's the Ko that I fell in love with? How about taking a ride to that girl's island? My CB's out front. Miiyo was waiting on the island as I'd hoped. I've been waiting here all this time. I've kept the Kawasaki polished and with a full tank of gas while I was waiting for you. Have you been fooling around on me? If I tried to fool around, you wouldn't let me. There's no way I could. Good. Feels great. The wind. Yeah. Just like last year. No way! It feels so much better than last year. Ko, can you do me a favor? Say yes. Yes. I want to ride. I want us to be the wind. Miiyo... And the two of us became the wind. This is what I believed: She wasn't just a girl. The island wasn't just an island. She was the island. And at that time I became a motorbike. She was me at that moment. And I was her. We were the same person. As we played around by splitting off onto different paths I felt that it was the truth. There's a drive-in near the bridge up ahead. I'll wait for you there. I'll wait for you. Well, in the light it was about this big. Here you are. Welcome. What would you like? Man, it's awful. I saw a terrible accident. - Where? - What? A good looking girl on a two-wheeler. She was flying. And then... hey! Hey! She goes into a curve, then she suddenly jerks the handlebars to the right. There's a vehicle in the other lane. In such a hurry in rain like this... You could hear the tires. Poor girl hit a truck. It's as slick as this on rainy days. - So smooth. - Hey! So what happened? She got dragged 50 meters. Instant death. A hare just ran out into the road. No need to jerk the handlebars like that. She swerved to avoid a hare? Is that right? I was passing by on the way here. I saw her face. What a good looking girl. - What a shame. - Hey, did she look like us? It would be a shame if it was either of you. Sorry I'm late. Miiyo... I'd caught her. She was there from one summer to the next. She became my story. "What happens after we take the photo?" I'd ask. "Don't ask something like that," she'd undoubtedly answer. And then the wind would blow. It would truly be summer. And summer is where my heart lies. Subtitles by nitroblast for ADC
