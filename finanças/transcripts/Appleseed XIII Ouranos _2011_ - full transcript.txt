Olympus... A utopian city centered around humans and artificially-created, genetically-engineered bioroids. An Argonaut-created Landmate designed for outer space deployment... II Oh! Hi, Deunan! Let me introduce you! This is Deia, a bioroid researcher sent here from Poseidon! How do you do, Deunan? I'm Deia Cides. Forget it! I ain't going home! Why do humans get like this? A bioroid like you wouldn't understand! It's about Briareos again, isn't it? Briareos? Her man. He's a Hekatoncheires cyborg! For a Hekaton, that jerk's completely blind to women's feelings... Sorry for the trouble. It's no problem. It happens all the time. Hitomi's a nice girl. Well, bioroids are designed to serve humans and all. How many humans are there in Olympus? We humans are only 20% of the population. Bioroids even run Olympus' administration. Still, I never imagined that you lived so nearby. Thank you for saving me earlier. It was nothin'. Just doing my job. --Well, see you later. --Yes. Goodnight. Briareos... You're nice and warm... Just talking in her sleep... There exists no such thing as a paradise created by bioroids. Not twenty years ago, and not now. I'll start with the analysis results. The case likely contained Argonaut-made Damysos parts. Argonaut? The Argonaut is in Poseidon's jurisdiction; have they not yet disposed of it? No, Ma'am. While it did land in a place well-suited for terrorist bases to spring up, it also serves as a vital source of information. So they're being primed, huh? To think that this is the end of the Argonaut, once revered as the "Mobile Corporate City." Alcides founded the Argonauts in the hopes of finding a paradise where people can live like people. Technological development made by man alone... That was the challenge that faced us if we hoped to change our future. Through repeated failures-- no, through repeated trial-and-error, the Argonauts finally successfully developed their own unique technology. In pursuit of Alcides' ideal paradise, this technology rapidly advanced and grew grander in magnitude. This culminated in the Stymphalean, a large Landmate designed for outer space deployment. This level of technology was so great, in fact, that it surpassed Poseidon's and made the Argonauts' name known throughout the world. And so, Alcides, unrestrained by Poseidon, declared independence to safeguard that technology and the people on the Argonaut. However, this provoked Poseidon's hostility, resulting in an influx of pirates seeking the Stymphalean, operatives from major nations, and other sordid antagonists. That Landmate is a Hekatoncheires. Vengeance belongeth unto me. What are you going to do about this? Should it destroy Tartaros, the entire Ark Project will go up in smoke. Eurys. Focus on keeping Tartaros' gene banks powered and running. You're also to decide which types should have highest priority. I'm placing the future of this city in ES.W.A.T.'s hands. You intend to break into the system?! You'll fry your brain! Stop resisting! Your head'll be next! How I envy you... Your man is still alive...! Deia! Briareos! Deunan! Get out of there! We're taking it out! The Deia who suddenly appeared before us... Just who are you? This really reminds me of when I used to be happy... What are you talking about? That reminds me, your partner was pretty worried about you. Don't wait until it's too late. I speak from experience. Now, now! Don't cry! Don't cry! Mommy Hitomi's here! There, there! You've gotten good at that! Yep! Deia taught me! Deia did? Yeah. Before she left for Poseidon. Deia's great with babies! Didn't you know? I didn't think bioroids had maternal programming, but we actually do! Although it's technically just copying the childcare guidelines given to us. I personally wasn't raised by a mother, so I don't have much to go on. Oh, actually, what's a real mother like anyway? Huh? What I mean is, what was your mom like, Deunan? Hmm... Yesterday, at 0800 hours, Deia Cides entered Olympus from Poseidon. The administration plans to welcome her as an official ambassador. Can't we arrest her? It's clear as day that she masterminded that terrorist attack. Deunan and Briareos saw it all. According to Poseidon, the terrorist is dead. There's nothing we can do, unless we can somehow show that the terrorist and Deia Cides are one and the same. To think that a terrorist who should be dead would just waltz right back as an ambassador... Thank you for inviting me to Olympus, considered the most beautiful place in the world. As an ambassador of goodwill, I offer my utmost gratitude. This is a goodwill visit of a leading nation. I welcome you warmly. Please overlook the disorderliness. The terrorist attack two months ago... You've rebuilt so much in such a short time... Bioroids are truly impressive. We simply assist humans, nothing more. But Gaia requires a bioroid for the Ark Project, correct? What's needed is an "unprocessed" bioroid. They're no different from humans, in terms of hardware. What's needed is not an unstable human but a perfect bioroid... Ambassador. What goal has brought you to where you are now? The friendly relations between our nations. No. What do you desire... ...that has made you who you are now? A treasure-the queen's girdle. What? A hero once went to steal a queen's treasure, but instead fell in love with her and had a child. However, due to the goddess of jealousy's scheming, the hero murdered the queen and left with the treasure. It's said the hero was filled with regret upon realizing what he'd done. What are you referring to? It's just an old story. Deia Cides is technically paying a goodwill visit, but her main objective is to help harmonize Poseidon's view of the Ark Project, as led by Olympus. The project's goal is a spacecraft capable of ultra-long-term self-sufficiency, allowing for manned exploration of deep space using Mars as a foothold, right? And apparently this enormous spacecraft needs to be centered around the perfect leader. Gaia has narrowed the selection down to ten candidates. It has been revealed that 3,000 frozen embryos stored at the Tartaros Center have been destroyed. Murder while being transported in an armored car... Death due to lack of genetic manipulation... Of the ten confirmed candidates, seven have already died in one way or another. You're saying the goodwill ambassador is plotting their deaths? Don't you mean Poseidon? The Chief of Staff has ordered us to protect one of the three who remain: Councilman Theseus of the New Poseidon Party and bearer of Alcides' genes. He, his wife, and his daughter will be at a hotel in the city tomorrow, where he is scheduled to meet with Deia Cides. You're to take the K2s and provide 24-hour security for the councilman as soon as he is under our authority. Alcides died protecting the woman carrying his child. Daddy! These butterflies are pretty! Indeed. Package is clear. --Line of sight? --Clear. No obstructions. Surroundings? Clear. No acoustics, thermals, or jamming. How will we deal with possible Hekatons? We can hold them off, assuming equal capabilities and an indirect incursion. There are no bioroids among the security team. So the only possibility for bioroid intervention is through direct contact. I take it you've screened all the hotel employees and security members? All clear. Just to be safe, we screened the wife and daughter too, but they were a perfect match with the bioroid genes stored at Tartaros. For safety reasons, I must conduct a body check. Of course. Go right ahead. Thank you for your cooperation. This is tight security. Now I can rest easy, too. Hey, Briareos. Is this something that needs personal coded transmissions during an operation? Apparently Deia's good with children. Don't let your feelings get in the way of things. Yeah. I know. Here she comes! No jamming. She's not connected to the outside. Keep your guard up. Her left arm is intact and functioning. Package has entered the meeting area. Due to the goddess of jealousy's scheming... ...the hero murdered the queen and left with the treasure. It's almost time for the meeting to end. Sit assessment. Employee members clear. Continuing surveillance to prevent contact. All terminals are clear. No contacts. Surroundings clear. Clear. No activity. This is her last chance to make a move. Don't take your eyes off her. Package is clear. She didn't do anything. Her role as Poseidon's ambassador must've taken priority. All terminals clear. Surroundings clear. Switching to Security Level B. The security level's been changed. Mm. Go and get some fresh air for now. We still have more bodyguard work ahead of us. Thanks, Briareos... I hear you're good with children. Hitomi told me. She asked me to help take care of it when I get back. A bioroid raising a child... How ironic. Huh? Bioroids are things. Not human. They're like butterflies that should be extinct, existing almost casually in a temporary paradise where they shouldn't. I refuse to accept it. Do you feel that way about Hitomi too? Not just Hitomi--do you feel that all bioroids are temporary beings? They're no different from humans, with children of their own and families they want to protect. They're puppets that know nothing about the humans they were based on and hold no suspicion as they smile with their make-believe families. Even if they lose their "families," they'll soon be given false replacements with the same emotions. Such bioroids can't possibly replace humans. You said before that you lost your family. I lost my mother when I was little, too. We were walking along the street when she was suddenly shot from behind. Just because her skin was a different color. You simply don't know. The sadness of losing someone is nothing like that. True sadness produces hate. Sadness without hate is nothing more than an excuse. You don't think it was painful for me?! If you lost the man you loved and it was your fault, could you stay as you are now? Do you not feel the sadness of those who've been killed and those who loved them?! Do you think you're a god or something?! If you believe you can walk a separate path than me... ...then just try and stop me. Just stay still! There! Good girl! I am a hero who returned with the treasure... Deia! Deia! I'm sorry. This is technically Poseidon soil. Deia... A sculptor named Poeas. He's one of the remaining unprocessed bioroids. I'm sure you've heard we're on 24-hour personal security duty starting tomorrow. Mm. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Dear... Why do you suppose Deia came back to Olympus as a Poseidon ambassador? I don't know. But I'm sure we'll start to see why as we do what needs to be done. Wow! But aren't these...? What's with that? It's something aging sculptors often do. His grip has weakened to the point that this is the only way he can continue his work. Apparently he's been doing the same thing for decades now. Good work, Deunan! Hitomi! I didn't know you were here! Yep! I came to bring you a change of clothes! Thanks, Hitomi! But you didn't need to go out of your way to bring me extra clothes. What about the baby? It's okay, Yoshitsune is looking after it! Plus sometimes I want to be free from the baby too, you know? This is nice recreation for me! Bioroids are intriguing, huh? Some are like me and will suddenly become a mother or whatever else Gaia wants, while others are like that old man and will dedicate their entire lives to creating art. Yeah. Oh, no! It's almost past milk time! Bye! She calls this recreation but rushes back home in a tizzy... Sheesh. Maybe she came to see you because she was worried? Huh? Because this Deia stuff's taken a toll on you. That concludes my report. However, sending ES.W.A.T. members to guard me has certainly made things at home a bit lively. You're certainly a worrywart, Prime Minister Athena. A worrywart, you say... I'm nothing compared to the Judicial Bureau, though. I assume they intend to utilize both FBI and ES.W.A.T. surveillance. Wouldn't that be advantageous for the Administrative Bureau? You believe it's vital that you give the impression that you have a handle on the situation, do you not? Are you saying being overly cautious could prove detrimental? Not at all. I'm simply admiring your prudence. Well, I must be going now. The Ark Project essentially places the future of humanity in the hands of an unprocessed bioroid... Just how practical do you feel this project is, Prime Minister Athena? I was unaware that you held such dissatisfaction for it. Given that Gaia proposed it, I'm sure it has justifiable reasons of some sort. Still, even so... Are you trying to say it's risky? I'm well aware of Poseidon's fierce objections to Olympus progressing with this project. But canning the entire project because of that would be playing precisely into their hands. Using Mars as a foothold to push deeper into space is a very big gamble on our part, but I've left everything entirely in the hands of Eurys, the project's architect. He's one of the unprocessed bioroids as well. As vessels no different from humans with a possible free will of their own, they present new possibilities... Bioroids aren't human. They're nothing but puppets made to work for humans. Say, why are you...? What exactly are you sculpting? Oh, sorry! Did I bother you? The twelve labors of Hercules. Hercules... In Greek mythology, the hero Hercules was cursed by the goddess Hera, leading him to slay his own sons. As atonement for what he'd done, he performed twelve "labors." The Nemean Lion... The Ceryneian Hind... The Erymanthian Boar... The Augean stables... The Stymphalean Birds... The Cretan Bull... The Mares of Diomedes... The girdle of the Queen of the Amazons... The Cattle of Geryon... The golden apples of the Hesperides... The guard dog of the Underworld, Cerberus... And this, the Lernaean Hydra. So once you finish sculpting this, they'll all be done? No, actually, I think this one might never be finished... Why not? It's the last one... Because I am a bioroid. My creations are nothing more than imitations... They are woefully inferior to art produced by humans. This Hercules sculpture was modeled after someone. It was? His name was Ercole. He was a sculptor too. We were a lot alike in many ways. Except that he was a human, not a bioroid. We joined the same workshop and polished our skills as if competing with each other. However, a clear difference between us began to show. Even when we made similar sculptures, he would always have many supporters while I would have none at all. He was the only one who acknowledged my works. He would try to cheer me up with a smile. But at some point he made the realization that his skill wasn't the reason his works were so well-received. Gaia had produced bioroid supporters to keep human artists in Olympus feeling satisfied, regardless of the art they created. Ashamed of his vanity, he ended his life. There hasn't been a human artist in Olympus ever since, because Gaia has cleverly avoided the risk of humans committing suicide upon feeling the despair of utter barrenness and futility. However, I was filled with the desire to know if his creations truly were shams or not. Ever since, I have continued to create the works Ercole strived for. Do you feel that way because you're an unprocessed bioroid? Are you devoting your life to your deceased friend because you're a bioroid? This isn't about being a bioroid or a cyborg or a robot or a human. You made these. I think they're works of art only you could make, having followed in Ercole's footsteps. Having followed in Ercole's footsteps... Deia! Deia! How did Deia break in?! She hacked and infiltrated us at the same time. She has unbelievable processing power... The feelings of a bioroid who devoted his life to art for his friend's sake are no different from the feelings a human mother has... ...for her child. The Landmates are in perfect synchronization. I've finished tampering with the insects too, as requested. I see... The neural load is at its limits. I can't guarantee your safety at any higher levels... Just one person left... It won't be long now, Alcides... For me? I want you to have it. But it's so important to you... Compasses always point north. Regardless of whether you're a human, bioroid, cyborg, or a robot, compasses always point in the same direction. It's up to us to have faith in that and choose the path we must follow. I will continue to look to the future. I want to walk toward that future with you. Alcides... Let's get married. The goal of Olympus' ultra-long term Ark Project is to have bioroids conduct deep space exploration. The passengers will be arriving at the spaceport for tomorrow's journey into space. Deia Cides, who is currently residing in Olympus as a goodwill ambassador of Poseidon, has commented by saying that she has great hope that this will usher in a new future for all bioroids. It's believed that this exploration will be a big step in solving the natural resource problem. Deia... Are you really... a Poseidon terrorist? Or are you someone out to get revenge for the one you loved? Just try and stop me. Deia...! I will stop you! 150 multi-legged turrets have already been deployed around the Argonaut. Multi-legged turrets? New model Auto lnsectors. Talk about some serious firepower... ES.W.A.T. will provide air support while the Auto lnsectors cover things on the ground. Grow strong! Pollux. Brother... Today's your birthday, right? Wow! Thanks, Brother! But I'd actually like that more. Not until you're a grown-up. But you're still a kid too... Oh, you. What do you think's going on? The Argonaut is smack dab between Olympus and the spaceport. So it'll serve as the base of operations for Eurys' security detail. We're using a suspected terrorist den as a base of operations, Sir? That's just asking for a surprise attack. That's precisely why we need to secure it. What will the Poseidon ambassador be doing? Apparently they won't disclose that info. Sounds like Poseidon's going to handle her security. What a pain. Can't we monitor her ourselves? We're going to have an FBI agent on board. How are you feeling, Ambassador? Very well. Everything is progressing just like you wanted. You're about to make yourself a hero... Are you excited? You'll become the hero of Olympus, and Poseidon will gain the trust and benefit of the old superpowers. That's our business deal. Deia... Don't strain yourself. This isn't about Deia. The Bronze Bird incident proved that Poseidon is secretly pulling the strings. Still, if Deia really is Alcides' wife, then I feel like she isn't through yet. Indeed, she probably has a personal grudge against Olympus. There's no way for us to know just who she really is and what she's done. But the Deia we're faced with now is unquestionably our enemy. A vile terrorist. The envoy's private plane will be taking off shortly. Surroundings? Clear. All right. Deploy the Guges Ds. Commence operation. 109. 113. Commence operation. 109,oven 113,oven The ambassador's actions remain unchanged. Still en route for Poseidon via scheduled course. Continue to monitor her. Understood. I will curse god and end the bioroids. Is something wrong, Ambassador? The Poseidon plane? What about the ambassador? A naval search is underway. To think that they would take direct action... What are they thinking? Perhaps Poseidon isn't responsible. You mean a personal vendetta? That's absurd. What would she be left with? Might the eradication of Alcides' genes have been her real aim all along? I assume none of the candidates' genes are backed up in Tartaros? Correct. They were disposed of due to the cryogenic problems that arose after the skyjack incident. Only the genes in Eurys are left. So she's willing to embroil the whole world in this just to strike a single target... What is it? Gaia requests a meeting. Gaia does? The Poseidon plane has been attacked. And the ambassador?! Currently missing. A search is underway in the surrounding waters. Keep a sharp eye on the envoy's plane! I'm here. I hear the Poseidon plane's been shot down. I thought our business deal was finished. The deal between you and me was. She's running the show now. Ask her for the details. Professor Leon?! I've found you. The security control net is being hacked! What is it?! The Auto lnsectors...! Our home...! Let's get outta here, Brother! Yeah. It's no use! It's continuing to hack into the control network! We can't pre-empt it! It has the processing power of a Hekatoncheires! A Hekatoncheires... Deia's nearby! 113! 109! Take out the enemy Hekatoncheires! Roger! We're counting on you. Look for her, Briareos! Just try and stop me. Where? Where are you, Deia?! Even if Poseidon is not a god but a devil, I will still obey and eradicate the bioroids. Found her! Enemy dead-ahead! ETA, 0800 hours! Don't get hasty. You'll leave yourself open. I'll cover your blind spots. With all the eyes I have? Even with them you can't see everything! Here she comes! Deia! This place should be safe. Now just stay here and hide. What about you? I'm gonna take a look outside. Don't worry. I have this. Stay right here. Mm! Those bastards...! I won't let you get in my way! I have your back, Briareos! I won't let you get in my way! Brother... What happened to Alcides?! Things went exactly as planned, Deia. Well done. The envoy's plane has cleared the danger area! Disarm immediately! It's over. You can't chase him anymore! Yes... It's over. Crap! The envoy's plane... It's been shot down... The other Landmate... The cockpit's empty. You can control that Landmate remotely?! It's all over now, Alcides... Why did you come here? This never would've happened if you guys hadn't come here...! This place isn't your world! It's the world our hero left us! The hero... The hero... Deia! It didn't hit any vital spots! I think her brain's been overtaxed. The neural load was too much for her. I'll see if I can stabilize her. Deia... The hero fell in love with the ruler and had a child... However, due to the god of jealousy's scheming, the hero murdered the ruler and left with the treasure... It's said the hero was filled with regret... --...upon realizing what had happened. --What is she saying, Briareos? Bioroids aren't human. They are "things" humans use. But as long as bioroids exist, they will be dragged into human conflicts. Just like with the Great Flood of long ago, strife will continue endlessly until it engulfs all people and bioroids. Finally shut 'em up... Hurry and cyber-lock 'em all. Got it. Somethings coming. Is it that red one?! You, there! Stop! Briareos... The hero sought... the treasure... 109.113. We've taken an unexpected visitor into our protection. Deunan! Apparently she's taking a baby with Alcides' genes to the spaceport, at Gaia's request. Alcides... Deunan! Hurry here! There, there! Don't cry! Even Gaia had prepared a double of him... This is truly unexpected. But the god of jealousy is also wiser than the god of the earth. Her neural load's increasing! Deia! Bioroids must pay. Stop, Deia! Vengeance belongeth unto me. The other Landmate! It's kind of sad that we have to say goodbye to him today. Have you gotten attached? It's not like you have a genetic relation, plus you only took care of it because Gaia asked. That's true, but still... You're really good with babies, Deia! I wonder if this is how humans' "happiness" feels... A red one's headed your way! It's after the baby carrying Alcides' genes! We'll take care of the other one! Roger! The last unprocessed bioroid is at the Argonaut? Yes. Will it arrive here safely? If we have faith in ES.W.A.T. So Gaia wants us to trust in humans... Humans have a force of will bioroids can never possess. The future of humanity rests on the Ark Project. If Gaia has chosen to have humanity decide their future... ...then we must have faith in humanity too. Damn you! Briareos! You okay?! Yeah... We'll protect your world! Bioroids must pay. Where's the red one?! All of the Argonaut's internal sensors are jammed. Guess we'll just have to keep our eyes peeled... Here it comes! She's found him! Go, now! Go where?! Just go! Move! She went through here, all right. Deunan. I gleaned some info from Deia during our neural link. What's her deal? It happened just before the Argonaut was bombed. A bioroid of me... Yep. It will be at your beck and call from now on. Alcides. You should have the bioroid handle things like that. It exists solely to serve you, after all. For people to live like people, we must not lose the ability to feel. As long as people, bioroids, cyborgs, and robots are striving for the same goal, I consider them all treasured family members. A paradise where people can live like people... For me, any place where I can live with you and this child is paradise. Deia... Poseidon used the bioroid Deia brought here as a marker to bombard the Argonaut. Alcides and the unborn child died, but Deia miraculously survived. As a result, Deia became Poseidon's heroine. What made her become a Poseidon minion? Perhaps hating bioroids was the only way she could cope with the sorrow she was left with. You simply don't know. The sadness of losing someone is nothing like that. True sadness produces hate. They kill people without qualms if ordered to. They're coldhearted puppets. Don't wait until it's too late. I speak from experience. Hey, Briareos. Wanna get married? We're in the middle of a mission, you know! Yeah, I know. I want Deia to remember... I want her to remember her family again. The family she loved. Because I know what it's like to lose your family, just like she did. Can my answer wait until after the mission? Yeah. Let's stop Deia! Right! Damn! Deia! Section E5! She's here! Deia! Stop! Deia! Deunan! I wanted to travel in search of paradise, even at the cost of my own life... Run, Deia! Deia... I love you. I am a sinful woman who has betrayed my husband and brought ruin to the Argonauts... Briareos... What is this place?! Everything is for humans' sake... This world revolves around humans. I wanted to flee from the world that was convinced that that was right. So I desired to embark on a journey to find true paradise, even if it would cost me my life... I never wanted to be a hero. I just wanted to travel with you in search of paradise... Deunan. I leave the baby--the future-in your hands. Deia! We are the gods who created the bioroids. Just as it's written in ancient history, those who defy the gods are punished to live with unending suffering. Bioroids exist to be used by us. Never forgive anyone who betrays the gods. I chose to sell him out to Poseidon so that I could live with the gods. Deia... Deia. You forgot this. Compasses always point north. Regardless of whether you're a human, bioroid, cyborg, or a robot, compasses always point in the same direction. Deia... You said that whenever you saw Hitomi, Briareos, and me getting along you were reminded of the time in your life when you were happy. For Deia, paradise was here on the Argonaut. It was one so beautiful that she couldn't bear to live in a new paradise. After some delays, the manned outer space exploration vehicle is about to be launched. The Ark Project was delayed. I'd say we had a good measure of success. Indeed. There's no need for worry. I've erased all data relating to the incident. No one will suspect Poseidon of anything. Everyone believes it was done of her own accord. Anyway, about the independent institution where I'm to be made director... Would it be possible to push the inaugural ceremony back one week? Oh, nothing. I was just planning on enjoying a short vacation. Deia... Maybe what humanity is striving for isn't the kind of paradise we have in mind. Even so, do you think we'll ever find it? Our paradise... Let's find it. For Deia's sake, too. A paradise where humans and bioroids can all be family... Yes. Hey, Briareos. That reminds me--what's your answer? Huh? Answer to what? You forgot?! You're terrible! --No idea what you mean. --Just give me your answer already! --All right, back to work! Let's go! --Hey!
