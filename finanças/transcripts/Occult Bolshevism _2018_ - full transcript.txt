That might have been a ghost. I've had two or three experiences like that. At first... I thought if I just talked about it... ...my role would be completed. But facing all of you this way... there is another truly terrifying experience. I can feel it. Everyone... you have all witnessed a person's death. I have, too. I was once a prison ward. I witnessed many executions. I might remember them if I heard their names. One had kidnapped and murdered a child for ransom. I performed his execution. Andō! I'm sorry. We had car problems. We got delayed. We only just started. Everyone! We all know Andō, don't we? Long time no see. I'll introduce you. This is my fianceé, Yukiko Tachibana. Nice to meet you. If you'll allow me, I will participate in today's special session. Thank you. Have you ever witnessed a person's death? My mother, on her deathbed... Incredible. Everyone here has witnessed a person's death. But that's only a coincidence. The reason you came today... Can you say? When I was 8 years old... I've been told I disappeared. They searched for three months. So... You were spirited away? I don't know. I don't remember. This is Sumié Miyaji. She's a medium. She'll help with our experiment. Nice to meet you. If either of you have any religious adornments, please give them to me. Such as prayer beads or an amulet. And your phone as well. This is to keep the atmosphere clean here. An individual's idle thoughts sometimes dwell in religion. That pendant... It carries strong feelings, doesn't it? My mother. What about this? That's fine. He'd kidnapped a child for ransom... and then murdered the child. It was a despicable crime. A few of my colleagues and I went into his cell. Just from hearing our footsteps... he knew that that day was his day. His face was deep blue. He was crouching in the back of his cell. I unlocked the door... he had his back turned and his ears covered, and didn't move. I put my hand on his shoulder and spoke. "The prison director and the chaplain are waiting for you." "It's your time now." "Face it like a man." "There is still time to speak to them." As soon as I said that, and tried to help him up... "NO!" He shoved me against the iron bar. He was unbelievably strong. He hit me so hard I couldn't move for awhile. My colleagues tried to hold him down... but he shook them off... and then clung to the toilet seat. I was shocked. He ripped off the toilet seat with his bare hands. The other guards tried to take it away... but he smashed one of them in the face with the lid... and the guard fell on the floor. "Who are you?" "Who are you?" He kept swinging the lid to keep the guards away. "If you kill me, I'll haunt you as a ghost!" His pupils opened so wide in his eyes... that his face no longer looked human. "Use your batons!" I heard myself call that out. Even when they hit him with their batons, it didn't stop him from resisting. He used the lid as a shield. When it finally broke... he bit one of their arms. Then he grabbed the baton as it fell, and started swinging it. I didn't think a human had such strength. I dragged my colleague out and locked the door. Everyone in the corridor was worn out and bleeding. Then, from inside the cell... I heard a laugh. Then what happened? I went to report it to the prison director. He asked when the unconvicted prisoners would return from exercising. It was very soon. The director nodded... and ordered the use of tear gas. We returned to the cell... it was totally dark, apart from his eyes glaring out at us. "I won't be killed!" "I absolutely won't be killed!" He was swinging the baton. And then... When a line of guards wearing gas masks arrived... "What are you doing with those?" His voice had changed. He was choking on tears. At the leader's signal, they thrust their muzzles to the jail bars. It's quite dangerous at that close range. He dropped the baton... and begged them to stop. They fired the tear gas. The cell became filled with smoke. I could hear him coughing violently. We pulled him out... put him in a straightjacket. He said in a crushed voice... "Help me!" "Help me!" he choked. He kept saying it as he was dragged down the corridor. In the corridor... there was a trail of urine where we dragged him. Did you do that often? No. This was a completely unusual measure. You may find this unpleasant, but... the thing I found most frightening... was what I felt in the man's resistance. Something unnameable. Anyone would try to resist. No. Humans give up much more easily. There was something unusual about his resistance. Why was he so afraid of death? How does a man become so strong that several guards can't hold him down? When I thought about that... I feel that I encountered... ...something. Did he come back as a ghost? No. It wasn't so simple. What I thought hearing your story... in the end, aren't humans the most frightening things? What did you do that for? That is a forbidden phrase. Forbidden phrase? Remarks like that only hinder the experiment. I should have sensed it. You nearly ruined the experiment. I see... You know that I'm critical of your attitude. I can't take it anymore after this treatment. Release me immediately! You all agree with me, don't you? Yuriko, let's go. I can't let you go now that the experiment has begun. We have already begun to make contact. Contact? We are spiritual vanguards, and you are our chosen guests. You, too. Do not forget this. I'm staying. You have received your first punishment. From now on, be careful what you say. A mysterious presence... It's scattered. Thanks to Mr. Mita's story. We should sing now. Let's sing. The power of our song will attract the spirit. Bolshevik Party Song! Hanae Kan Yūki Tomoyama Yōko Chōkosabe Kōsuke Takaki Emina Kondō Tomomi Kono Naho Honma Asako Minamitani Yōzaburō Itō Writer/Director: Hiroshi Takahashi OCCULT BOLSHEVISM My name is Nagao. I'm afraid I don't have a very good story. I'm actually not sure why I was invited here in the first place. As far as frightening experiences go... the best I have was only a dream. Please speak about it. Why did I have a dream like this? There had just been a terrible flood. Maybe that was the reason. I... had been walking around the area damaged by the flood. There were lots of abandoned houses. Suddenly, one abandoned house caught my eye. It was just an ordinary abandoned house, suddenly I wanted to see the inside... so I found myself going up to it. On the inside... furniture and things were scattered. Only a little light was coming in from outside. It was very dim. Then I heard a noise. I looked back... and in the distance, I saw the outline of a woman's figure in a back room. It must be someone exploring like me, I thought. But it felt strange, so I called out to her. This person... gave a little reply, almost like an evasion... I didn't say anything more. Then, suddenly... "Here," a voice called out to me. The woman... was pointing towards a corner of the room... she brought me around the house, and showed me... one by one, the place that every person in the house died, and how they died. Then she started speaking to me. It was incredibly detailed... I gradually started feeling queasy... I tried to leave as I was listening. Suddenly... maybe... this person died in this house, too. That thought came to me. As soon as I thought of it... I couldn't help but be worried. I looked back in terror. She was looking straight at me. I tried to make out what kind of person's face I was seeing. But... no matter how hard I looked... My vision was blurry, but as if only her face was covered in a haze. I couldn't see her well. So I looked at her feet. And then... She was barefoot. I'd never had such a frightening dream. You were frightened? Kataoka, can you play that back for us? One more time. We did hear the voice, didn't we? The overtones of everyone's voices can make the sound of another voice. Like chanting a Buddhist sutra. But... I clearly heard a man's voice. Everyone. Please pull out one card from the decks I gave you earlier. Focus your thoughts on this card. Yukiko. Please select another card. As the spirit's presence strengthens, probabilities becomes abnormal. It's already time... Everyone, please prepare for tomorrow. We will end here for today. The rooms are this way. Your luggage has already been prepared. Do you see something? No. Something's strange. Today's experiment was different from usual. It seems like the master has gathered us in such a remote place for you. What's wrong? I want to be alone. You go to bed first. Yukiko? What are you doing here? I couldn't sleep for some reason. Me either. The power you demonstrated earlier was amazing. I wonder if that was some kind of magic trick. I don't know what would happen if you said that in front of them. That was from your power. You are the most promising prospect. What do you mean? You came without knowing? Master Asano's goal... is to choose one of us to be possessed, and call out to the other world. Each of us... has come into contact with the other world somehow. Call out to the other world... So he needs a powerful medium. More powerful than Ms. Miyaji. It must be you! I know because I used to have that power. I've been losing it over time... by participating in this experiment... these old sensations are being revived. How were you discovered when you went missing? I went hiking with my parents... and I disappeared in the woods. They searched for me many times, but... in the end, they couldn't find me. But... my mother wouldn't give up... after the search was discontinued... she was searching in the forest alone. One day... she found me lying in the grass, I'm told. It was in the same place that I disappeared. My clothes were a bit ragged... What's wrong? I had no shoes I was barefoot What had happened in the meantime? I don't remember. What's wrong? I'm sorry. We couldn't sleep. It's already lights-out time. Please rest in preparation for tomorrow. Master has asked you not to discuss the experiment together. Yes, yes. I remember. Until tomorrow, then. Good night. My story... is very short. When I was a child... I saw something on a mountain. That was probably something I shouldn't have seen. I was playing on the mountain with my younger brother. I held my brother's hand as we climbed... and we both suddenly stopped. I could tell... that there was a presence in front of my eyes. Neither my brother nor I could raise our faces. Then... a cold wind suddenly blew by... and without thinking, my brother and I raised our faces. Facing the slope that we were on... there was a ridge on another mountain. Along that ridge... I saw something crawling. I looked back... and my brother was looking at me with frightened eyes. When I noticed, I pulled my brother's hand... and ran down the mountain in a frenzy. That evening... we both ran high fevers... and my brother died the next morning. I tried to save him... but that's how it turned out. It was after that that I was able to see spirits. What is it that you saw? I don't want to explain it. And I can't. It wasn't something for human words. As soon as I saw it, I regretted it. My brother and I didn't say a word, but we understood it. Here's what's interesting. I've shown Ms. Miyaji various pictures and videos until now... but she says that this is closest to what she saw. Isn't this a famous fake photograph? The one that deceived Conan Doyle, supposedly? That's right. Then... you saw a fairy? The appearance and shape were completely different. The photos themselves... were faked by propping up magazine images in the ground. However, the sensation is very similar. Yukiko! Go ahead. You're next. I... For a long time, I've... felt like... someone was whispering in my ear. I can't quite hear who it is, or what they are whispering. When I look in the mirror... I feel like that someone will appear right next to my face. So I don't like to look at mirrors. I think I started hearing the voice... after a strange letter arrived at my house. I think... there must be a connection. A strange letter? I wasn't allowed to read it... so I don't know what was written in it. After that... my parents... began arguing terribly... In the end... my father left us. I think my mother burned the letter. And then... my mother and I lived alone together. One time... my mother... glared at me with a terrible expression. I was playing in the yard... and I looked into my mother's room on the second floor. My mother was standing by the window. She had a frightening face... while she was looking down at me. That was strange. Even when our eyes met... her expression didn't change at all. She just... kept staring at me, as if I were standing still. I got scared. I ran into the house. Then... I heard the sound of the front door opening. It was my mother, returning from shopping. So... maybe it had all been my imagination. My mother died later. I returned to her house... to her room on the second floor... to prepare her estate sale. Once again... I started hearing that whispering voice. It came from inside the closet. It got closer, frightening me. I opened the closet. There was an old doll in there. I don't know why, but I had a bad feeling. No... to be honest... that doll... looked a bit like my mother, I thought. And then... I brought it to a temple. When the head priest saw the doll, he said that she wasn't just my mother, so all of her other relatives gathered and we held a memorial service. When we began to burn it for the ritual, the doll became wrapped in flames. Suddenly, black smoke rose all at once. It cracked and sizzled like burning meat. When the smoke flowed towards us... it smelled terrible. Everyone... covered their mouths, without thinking. Then... in the center of the flame, the doll... It moved two or three steps. We also shrieked. Then the doll... burned down there. Stop it! What happened? Nothing. Somehow... I completely... I'm sorry. Please excuse me. Are you all right? That evening... I had a very mysterious dream. Yukiko, you can stop. I was floating in the air. I was looking down on myself, being burned. Black smoke was rising... and it smelled just like from the doll. I see myself on fire... and about to start moving. It's very... frightening. I try... to close my eyes, but... I can't do it. That's when I understood. Why I couldn't close my eyes. It's because my eyelids were burned off by the flames. That means... ...everyone who burns to death... has their eyelids burned off. So they can't close their eyes while they die. Was the thing she saw in the closet... really a doll? Hey! Who is that? Mother! You're here! Sorry for the sudden power outage. Power outage? The light has suddenly disappeared. It was the same yesterday. Until now, this kind of thing... There's another strange sound on the tape. I see myself on fire... and about to start moving. It's very... frightening. It's you, isn't it? You summoned it, didn't you? No! I've had enough of this! It's already almost there! Don't you understand? What did they say just now? If we quit now... all of you will be haunted to death! Haunted to death? What do you mean? Once you have summoned it, you must allow it to return. She's the one who summoned it! What's it got to do with us? The experiment will continue until everyone's talk is over. I'm the only one who hasn't gone yet, right? Let's finish this quickly! Any frightening story will work, right? You... killed a person, didn't you? Yes. As you say, I've done that. I've never been frightened before. Maybe I came to this seminar... because I wanted to feel scared. I was bored by everyone's stories. If you're so interested in the afterlife why not kill someone and see if they haunt me, I thought. Now I think that's a childish idea, but it's what I thought at the time. I killed the woman I was seeing at the time. She was also seeing another man... so I tried to keep anyone from noticing that we were dating. So I wasn't worried that anyone woudl find out. I brought her to a cliff where no one was around... I explained my reason for killing her, and pushed her off. Come to think of it... I had car problems on the way to the cliff, too. Mr. Mita! You spoke of someone's incredible resistance in their final moments. Such a desperate human face could not be found at the Olympics. Usually, when a person dies... the entire reality created by that person disappears. However, I'm not sure whether that woman was ever a reality for me. But, strangely... my own reality changed after that day. I came to think that... the me that pushed her off a cliff and the current me are two different people. It's not that I want to escape from guilt. It's a separate reality, like a dream. That's what I think. Probably everyone who has killed a person thinks this. When the body was discovered... and when the police arrested her boyfriend, I didn't think anything. As soon as he saw her dead body... I'm told he confessed to killing her. He's still in prison. Sometimes, I imagine that I'm the one... looking out of a prison window. Perhaps... he's a man who looks just like me. Ultimately, the woman hasn't ever tried to haunt me. Even if she haunted you, we couldn't prove that she came from the afterlife. It could be that her spirit has just continued wandering in this world. I see what you mean. It was a childish idea. But one day, I reached into my pocket, and noticed some prayer beads. The ones that you burned yesterday. I didn't put those there. Why did someone put them there, I wonder? It seemed like a sign, saying "I know." It frightened me. I couldn't get rid of the beads. I carried them everywhere with me, until yesterday. Are you mocking us? Thank you for telling us. You're the one who's been chosen. What? This is the letter that Yukiko spoke of earlier. Her mother knew everything. But no one believed her. I see myself on fire... and about to start moving. It's very... frightening. Yukiko. Mother. You're not Yukiko. The real Yukiko was secretly switched. You're not Yukiko. The real Yukiko was secretly switched. Then... I... Yukiko! It's no use. She can't hear anything now. The world she came from is summoning her. You said I was chosen... What are you doing? What is this? Everyone is waiting. Let's go. I want to see what kind of face it has. But no matter how hard I look... Stalin's politics of fear... is the ultimate Bolshevik idea! Wait! Wait! It's not enough to be afraid of death. The soul is indestructible forever! No! You can't kill me! You can't take my soul! Have we summoned the other world? No. There's no such thing as "the other world." We can only... call out monsters. Monsters? Almost! It's almost here! You're not Yukiko! Mother... Return the real Yukiko! A tree branch? No! Wait! Don't go! It was all... in vain. No! Us, too? This building has been polluted. Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? The End Subtitles by smilethebeachboysloveyou
