STORMY WATERS Get on. You're drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm ill because of the food. Besides, it's their fault. I'd told Poubennec: "We should've done your wedding aboard the Cyclone." Then I'd have done the cooking. You're not fit to talk to me! You're not a man. How do you mean? You cook for the Dutch. You're no longer a man or a cook. A potato is what you are. A spud. That's right, you're a spud. Shut up, cook. Let the doctor speak. Okay, I'll let him speak. A sailor's marriage isn't like any other marriage. As the poet said, every sailor has two wives: His own and the sea. Still you mustn't be jealous, ladies. The sea isn't a mean mistress, even when she's rough. And if your husband's with her, he's faithful to you. The things Maulette comes up with... Now, I propose a toast to the health of the newlyweds. And here's to the crew of the Cyclone, the bravest crew in Brest. Valiant rescuers, whose certificates and medals prove... Please, Doctor. I heard that at the Sorbonne. Whatever you say, Captain. Here's a toast to Captain Laurent and his charming wife. Hurray for the Captain, for one finds captains both in Brest and all over the world. And good captains they are. Excellent captains even. But a captain like yours, gentlemen, has no equals. The mold he was cast in got broken. Captain, your speech. Nothing to say. Forgive me. Say something, they'll like it. The doctor spoke like a book. I've nothing to tell, I'm no storyteller. Poubennec's married. He's happy, so is his wife. So we're all happy. What else is there to say? I propose a toast to those who are on duty on the Cyclone. And in the memory of those who were here once and have left us. No more speeches. This is a wedding. We're here to be merry! Let's dance. May I dance with the bride? Of course, your Cyclone is a good tug. I don't deny that. But the Dutch is good as well. She's new and she's fast. And I mean "fast". So what? We get there first. You must admit she's quite a competitor. They play a trick on us, we pay them back double. Goes with this blasted business. Don't complain. Saving lives is a beautiful job. - Talk about a beautiful job... - Lives don't pay, but you also have the boat... A boat, when you've hooked it, you're in for a lot of money. It's harder than simply hooking it. Must moor it to the quay. Plus, we handle the charcoal, the damage... all the hassle. All that means risks. And then the good weather, it spells unemployment for us. A storm a day, that'd be too good. Poubennec, give me my wife back. Yours has nice eyes and is a good dancer. That's easy with a partner like you. You are a good dancer, we haven't danced together for so long. I was there watching you, thinking it still feels the way it did ten years ago. I felt so good. I love you so much, Andre. Why are you so sad all of a sudden? I'm not at all sad. But I love you and I know you love me. You men don't understand these things. What things? For instance, that we can feel so entirely happy, and still feel like crying. It's a fine time for crying... We have fun at a wedding! Go on, tell me what's wrong. Don't be mad because I'm nervous. Sometimes I get so worried. Worried? What do you worry about? - Nothing. - What do you mean? Well, your job, the boat, the sea... The sea? That's new! It isn't. I've always felt this way. And you know it. I stop living when you're at sea. At sea! You're making me laugh. There was a time when I'd be away for months, but nowadays I practically go nowhere. Our house is here, the boat's round the corner. Only short cruises alongside the quay. We only go out when we're needed. Which means danger. Look in the corners, you'll find lovers. They look like newlyweds themselves. Hey, take a look at Tanguy's wife with Le Gall. Quite an edifying show! What's he doing? Talking and talking. Honestly, I wouldn't want Tanguy to butt me. Because if he did, he'd gore me alright with his horns. There's a pump by the kitchen. Go rinse your head and get back when you're sober. Go on, do it. What's the matter? It's nothing. Fancy a dance? - No more tears? - No. It was a passing cloud. Captain Laurent, please. Go on, Mr. Holland! Nothing like this to put your wits back together. Leave it, I'm tired. Here I am, Mr. Tanguy. I'll handle the expenses. Stop being silly, it's an SOS. We'll cast off. What are you doing? You're crazy! That's my truck! Never doubted that. I know, Mrs Laurent. That's his job... Still, on a day like today... Don't complain, Marie. We're married. If it'd been yesterday, there'd have been no wedding. Hurry up, old man. Don't fret, I won't leave her alone tonight. If you see my wife, tell her I said good-bye. I love her. Let's go. Everyone's here? Where's Le Gall? Yes, where's he gone? We can't wait, old man. Let's go. What boat is it? Mirvakin, 6,000 tons, broken rudder. - 44-46 north. 6'50" west. - That's all? Good. Send a signal. From Cyclone, ocean tug. 1,800 H.P. Coming out for you. Ready to go about? Keep the bike till tomorrow. 60 revs ahead. Where were you? - My business. - Also concerns me. People look for me, they can find me. You won't say where you were? Everyone knows, but Tanguy. He's my second. His wife can do whatever she likes, but not with members of my crew, understand? I was away 15 minutes. You know what those 15 minutes mean? We risk everything for 5 minutes. Next time, you go. Get along now! Port ten. You're going off course! Mirvakin accepts on Loyd terms. No share no pay. Confirm it. I'll take the risk. Gouedic, just one thing, hot drinks for everyone all night. I left it open! What a mess! Andre's certificate! His latest one! He's saved many people. But the bad weather takes its revenge. You know, I used to look at that photo and think I'd also marry some day. You both still look the same. When you're in love, 10 years go by so fast! - You were also happy that day. - That day. But a week later, Andre went to Chile for 6 months. Our honeymoon trip. Your dress looks like mine, despite fashion. A white dress is a white dress. What's most like a bride? Another bride. Are you ill? No, it's nothing. Heart flutter. I've always had it, since I was a child. Have you seen the doctor? Doctor Maulette likes me. Someone who likes you can't imagine you're ill. Tonight I told Andre I was worried. He laughed. He can laugh, he's strong. And he has things: His boat, the sea... I only have him. I wish we could go away. It's sad here! We're surrounded by memories, portraits, letters, certificates... Couples shouldn't keep things. We should live, love, be together... When something nice happens, we say: "I'll never forget this moment," as we know it won't last. Besides, I'm fed up. I'm ill, I'm afraid... Yes, I'm talking nonsense, Marie. I'm afraid of dying alone. One day, when Andre's away at sea, he won't be here to kiss me and tell me that he's always loved me. Feed that fire! I'm telling you. When the eyes start popping out in the broth, you're going too fast. The eyes? But your casserole has no eyes. It's blind. Still on cloud nine with the bride. You must admit it was quite a wedding, everything was going well. Then something went wrong, it had to be at my wedding. I'll only admit this: I'm not married. I wasn't trying to discourage you. Faithful women must exist. After all, one can even find two-headed sheep and three-legged snakes. Captain, I'm tired of this cuckold talk. I feel like drowning them in the broth. They're only having a laugh. I don't care, I'm tired of these jokes. That grumpiness means Tanguy's afraid of losing his mast. Royer, you always come up with the stupidest jokes. And they never change! With all my respect, I don't disturb your reading. Why do you listen to me? I may listen, read or eat, the contents are always demoralizing. Good job it's such foul weather, but for it, best thing to do would be to jump overboard. Very intelligent. Let's see... All that reading, you'll end up doing something silly. I prefer you plastered, a lesser evil. Where are you off to? Get all hands. I'll be in the wheelhouse. What are they saying? Say something. Answer me, dammit! Keeps saying the same thing: "Near you. Prepare towrope." The towrope? Look at them! They're like old sacks. Like insects. They're worse than beasts. What? Won't you listen? They'll miss the tow! For God's sake, Charles, wake them up! What am I supposed to do. They won't budge! Bunch of dirty bastards! Let him fix the cable himself. And go in the water with it. He got us here. He must save us! You shouldn't talk so! Why not? We'll die anyway! I'd hate to die like this. - We can lower a raft. - Are you mad? Let them be, Georges. Let them drown, if it's what they want. What does he say? Some customers! Listen to this: "Hurry up. Deck destroyed. Need urgent help." How he talks! Some sink without saying a word. Remember that three-master? They can't all sink like heroes. That's not all. Three other ships request assistance. Typical! It never rains, but pours. Can't help it. Rockets! Must be them. To top it off, she's adrift! Send them a signal. They may not see us. Say: "Heading for you. Passing rope. Get ready to catch it." Nice prize to hook. Isn't it, Captain? Worth the hassle. A fine ship. The Cyclone is on us. They'll try to send us the towrope. Take this to the captain. No, don't. I'll do it myself. That'll be better. The Cyclone is here. We must send them the towrope. Calm down. No need to hurry. 6 hours, we've been waiting. They bid their time. We'll do the same. That'll teach them. If we don't maneuver at once, we will suffer the consequences. No need to hurry. And to hell with their towrope. Why didn't they hurry up? 6 hours, after all the messages we sent! Now they're here, we must bow to them. We've waited this long, we'll wait longer. - Is that clear? - I see, but... The way we're drifting, we'll float away and crash on the rocks. I want to save my skin. All you care about is your skin! Forget the cargo, let it buy your lives. The cargo's mine, get it? I paid for it! Anybody wants to share the costs? You? The man in a hurry? It's my first and last voyage with you. Blast your scams. The towrope's here to hitch us up. Stay there. I'll handle the maneuver. - Marc! - You're not happy? Think about your men! I do! A man's only 50 francs a day. The insurance covers men and goods. The boat sinks, I'll get the money, the widows will get a pension. That's not enough. You're too coward to be a real sailor! What do you care what I am? That never bothered you. You're a bastard. You've always been one. For two years, I've had to put up with your face, your talk... But I never thought you could be as low on your boat. - Your men should drown you. - Catherine, I won't leave you. I hate you. One knows well the person one hates. I heard your lies just now! You will sacrifice your men for your money! The truth is, you're really trying to get to me! 2 years of the same. I was with you, you were glad to see me suffer. Now you know as soon as we land, I'll be gone. Never mind the boat and the men, you hate to lose me. Enough, Catherine! I may die, but not by your side. I'll take my chances. Will they take the towrope or what? Weird! All that whining, now what? What a wimp! Dear God! A raft... Good lord! Look at that raft! They must be nuts! A raft in this weather! The searchlight! We must make for them. Go port, 15. Look, Captain. They'll go under. If they don't, they'll crash into us anyway. A raft in the sea with the 2nd helmsmen and 2 sailors. I wish them luck. - Your wife's with them. - What? She jumped on the descending raft. No stopping her! The bitch! - They're being fished up. - The Cyclone! Happily, I managed to keep contact. All right. That bitch will pay me! - What's wrong, Tanguy? - A woman. Half dead, half drowned... All I know is it's a woman. - And Poubennec: 2 crushed fingers. - Shit! I'll see him later, the sun's on us, we must act fast. - Send the towrope. - Yes, Captain. - And the woman? - What? Put her in my cabin, she'll be warm. To windward. Hard aport. Take the towrope. Stand by! We've hitched up! Ahead, as slowly as possible. I'll see how the boys are at the galley. Hello, lads. How is it going? Let's see you. A Breton's head, that's solid stuff. Still, got a chip in my piggy bank. You'll get that fixed in Brest. You'll get a new nickel-plate zipper. Girls never resist that! You, Poubennec? Not too bad, Captain. A bit worried, though. Two fingers! Two fingers! That can't affect a newlywed. Could've been worse! That idiot! Understands nothing and won't stop laughing. This isn't a galley! It's a children's hospital, The Tower of Babel... They've tied it too badly. Shit! 50 grand down the drain. Haul in the bits. We'll send a new one. Good end for the season! That'll cost them about 8 grand. Maybe. It's a good deal. See, George, everything works out. We simply get dragged now. No need to hurry in life. Poor Catherine, panicking over nothing. She wanted to go and leave me. Where is she now, I wonder? At the other end of the line. Matrimonial ties are hard to break. This little adventure will come out expensive. It's good for their company: Shipwreckers United. - Say, Georges? - Captain? The towrope tore this morning, very naturally. Suppose it tore again once it's pulled in, would that surprise anyone? - Not too injured? - Grazed my arm. - You cleaned the wound? - We dressed it. - Has she said anything? - A little. - Is she French? - From Le Havre. How did she end up here? Listen, Bosco. Hellegouarch and Poubennec need an ambulance. - How are they? - Poubennec's lost blood. - Nice honeymoon. - Tough luck! Are there any injured? - Others like you on your ship? - I'm the only woman. You often go rafting in this weather? Couldn't care less. I just take back all I catch. Don't... Rescuing is a wonderful job! You call this rescuing? I'm only catastrophe's pen-pusher. Handle the papers. I'll see Poubennec's wife. I wanted to ask you... Have you towed Mirva? The Cyclone goes out, she never comes back alone. - She's behind us. - Too bad! What? You're a funny one! - You wouldn't understand. - Maybe. But do you realize what this cruise means to us? It took my men 12 hours to hitch up your boat and fish up people like you. If this were our daily routine, we'd change jobs. I thought I'd escaped that boat, but she's here. Listen, sweet pie, I don't want to know your stories. Everybody's got troubles. We should leave them on land. Like women! They should stay on land. That's what we call a frank man. Yes, that's a man. Good to get home. Right, Tanguy? Especially when you're not empty-handed. Starboard, fifteen... Truth is, I'll be happy to see my lovely wife. I like her. She's lovely indeed. Tanguy, the towrope! It'll break! A brand new rope, in this weather... Unbelievable! It is unbelievable. Read this, Captain. What a dirty trick! "Can still steer ship. Will get in unaided. Appreciate your trouble." "Unaided"! The rats! They cut the towrope to get in alone and not pay. Gang of crooks! - How is she? - Fine. Tell him she'll go back on the raft. - What? - I'm sending you back. - I won't go. - You will and so will your pals! Send them, if you want to. I'm not a crew member. I'm in charge here, understand? Kerlo, keep the blankets. Hurry up! Maritime life is swell! You come in a raft, you go back in a raft. I've never been so delighted to approach a ship in my life! I was really afraid I'd become a widower. Now I understand the meaning of understanding. You and I are united for life. All life long, you and I... - Captain. - What? Someone for you. Capt. Laurent, the Cyclone. I am very happy. - I wanted to see you. - You did! That was so kind of you. - Are you kidding? - Not at all. I owe you a lot! So you've found a way not to pay! Come on, I don't understand... Can you explain why and how the towrope broke? Hard, isn't it? Good weather, quiet sea... And to top it off, a brand new rope! Quite a mystery! A miracle! Here's my version: You backed up and broke it. And you got in unaided. There you go. You must be joking! How can you imagine I'd do that to a sailor? Please, spare me your bullshit! Crooks are crooks even on a boat. I understand your frustration. But you shouldn't accuse me of that! You have no evidence at all! It's fine to defend the interests of your company. But it makes plenty of money, Capt. Laurent! Losing some won't bust it. Oh, yeah... I'm sure we can come to an agreement. I'm not an ungrateful chap. I like to reward good will. You've worked all night and saved my wife. That counts! So you and I could maybe agree on something to reward your efforts. How much? Andre... I haven't shaved. I'm very prickly. Doesn't matter. I'm so happy you're back. Look at you! I wasn't in Greenland! I swear I wasn't that far. They made us move. You wouldn't believe it. Poubennec told me about your troubles. Poor fellow lost 2 fingers. How did his wife react? First, Marie cried. Then she was almost happy. Happy? Why? She thinks he'll give up sailing now. What would he do instead? Knitting? You women, you all want us sitting by the fire like pensioners. - Don't get angry. - Always the same old story. You're hungry. I have cutlets. Cutlets! I could eat an entire lamb! I'm so tired! It gives me the creeps, I swear, when I think about Hellegouarch's busted head. And the charcoal, the towropes... The whole thing's a disaster! Stop thinking about it. Let's eat. Yes, I'll eat the cutlets. I'm hungry as a wolf. I'm so hungry, I'm yawning. At least this is real coffee, it's not Royer's water. You're a kind little wife. You make me feel good. - I wish you'd love me. - Are you raving? - Love me as before... - What do you mean? I understand, you've grown too used to me. I'm always there, so are you. The days go by... Why aren't we as happy as we were in the first days? Only women can come up with such questions! I'm very happy with you. Are you unhappy? - Almost. - Why? If it goes on like this, I will be. What's the matter? My sad little life, that's the matter! We could be so happy if you wanted to be. Please, be reasonable. I've enough worries as it is. Oh forgive me... Come on. Don't be silly. Help me. I must write a report and send it to Paris. What infuriates me is that the Company will be pleased. I had a good reputation. Now I've bungled a job, they'll make the most of it. Sometimes I swear I feel like packing it all in and resigning. We have enough to live on. Do you really mean it? I do. Why? Not immediately, of course. But later, and I mean it. Later is always too late. We could have a peaceful life. If you felt bored, you could go back to sea. But we'd have had a long holiday. We'd go to Paris a while. And you wanted a house here. A fixed boat. It'd be nice to have a house of our own, with a big bedroom, all white, overlooking the sea, as you like the sea. That may be Marie. Hello, Mr. Tanguy. - Mrs. Laurent. Is it a bad time? - No, come in. Tanguy, just in time for coffee. Actually, I'm a bit nervy today. So no coffee... What's the matter? Captain, I'd rather not discuss it in the presence of your wife. Besides, I have itchy feet, so maybe we could go for a walk. I understand, let's go. - Excuse me. - Don't worry. I swear it's a serious situation. Don't make such a drama out of it. These things happen. - They only happen to me. - No. I won't make a drama but frankly, you're happy to get home... That was me. Then silence. No one. Not even a soul! Except for the cat and the children. A nightmare! She went out yesterday morning, slept out... And nothing. Not even a message. I don't understand. Don't worry. And to be honest with you, I'm not really angry, I'm worried. - What do you mean? - Worried. Come on, do you think your wife could be lost? You seem to like playing the fool. - The fool? - Exactly, pal. She's been openly cheating on you. You're the laughingstock for everyone. I know that. - So why don't you ditch her? - Ditch her. Ah, I've wanted to for a long time, but never dared. But this is it. Given enough rope, you'll hang yourself. Some people won't be happy. Mr. Lemeur for one. What? What is it? I'm about to make you unhappy, Mr. Lemeur. The source of your good jokes will dry up. And I say this in front of everyone: The fool's dead. Think of me as a widower or a bachelor from now on. Hello. Gabriel, I'm so happy. I knew you'd be here. I've been worried stiff, darling. Renee, I've told you: Given rope enough... I'll hang myself. I know it. Don't I get a kiss? You're shy because they're here. What do you care? I was so worried in Conquet last night. What did you go there for? I was with Etiennette. She was going to catch a boat to Ouessant, to meet Gaudin, the radioman. He's been moved there. Didn't you know it? I didn't. So what? The boat didn't leave because of the bad weather. Such awful weather! You know what I'm talking about. So everyone stayed there. Pierrot, Lou and Mrs. Frapier. - You stayed with them all day? - Yes. - And all night? - Yes. - Why? - What do you mean? I was looking after Etiennette. - Was she sick? - Seasick. - But the boat never left. - Anxiety. She's so nervous. She didn't sleep a wink, neither did I. A howling wind. I said to Etiennette: "Gabriel must be in the eye of the storm." Despite the appearances, I think about you when you're at sea. - Why aren't you listening? - It's nothing. Let's go away. - Where to? - What? Home, of course! Oh yes, home... You feel like laughing, but you dare not. You should, there's reason to. Right, Le Gall? He should laugh! Capt. Laurent's here? That's me, lad. It's all right. I'll be at the Hotel de la Mer. I'm sorry to bother you, you must be busy. I thought you were gone. No, I was a bit ill. Come sit down. I hesitated to call you, but I'm alone here. And I wanted to see you and thank you. You shouldn't bother. I wanted you to know... I'll be honest with you. I didn't save you, my second did. So that's not why you sent for me, I suppose. Don't beat around the bush, tell me what you want. Are you always so rude to women? In my line, we're not used to dealing with women. Wish I hadn't rescued your husband's ship. Please, don't mention my husband. - You're his wife. - Not anymore. I've left him. I last saw him the day you sent me back to him. - You won't see him anymore? - If I have my way. Maybe it's better like this. Anyway, the Company lost 3 grand. Some men live on that. They'll pay for the towrope. Any idea who cut it? I know who did it, but can't prove it. Easy, the entire Mirva crew know it. I'm not the only one who knows him. Where on earth did you find that man? In Le Havre. He bought goods there every 2 months, and took them to his region. He offered to take me with him. I said "yes." How long ago? Two years. That's long when you hate someone. What's the matter? You're different from the woman I saw in my cabin, soaking wet. Shipwreck costumes don't suit me. You're better now. You do notice women. Excuse me, I must go. - Not a drink? - No time. - The boss is waiting for me. - He can wait. - He's like a clock. - Just wind it back. - I really must go. - Do you regret coming? I have no regrets. Good-bye. Where were you, Captain, when the second towrope broke? Where was I? In the food cupboard, cooling up. Please, Captain. I mean, what did you see exactly? What you would have seen. A towrope breaking. And you can still assert that someone did that. - I'm sure someone did. - You are! It's proof we need. Investigate, you'll find proof. We could investigate, we could file a lawsuit. We could also lose it. Our clients wouldn't like it, nor would the directors. Those directors want to blame me? Fine me? - Give me a dunce hat? - We know your worth. So do I. Tell them they're annoying me. And I'm being polite. Actually, I have a present for them. I quit. You quit? You can't! Are you mad? Mad enough to do this job. I've been considering quitting. I'd like to relax and take walks like everyone else. With my wife. And I guarantee she'll be happy. Nothing we can do. Without you, we'll sell the Cyclone. - What? - That's right, and we've had some very good bids. - Who from? - The Franco-Dutch company. Great idea... What about the crew? I'm afraid we may be forced to lay them off. Nice... Business and feelings... Business and feelings don't go hand in hand. Yvonne, how can a sensible woman like you imagine such things? Whatever you say, what I have is serious. I've known it some time. Like all patients, you don't know what you have and you imagine the worst. As in a book. What you really need now is rest, peace and quiet. No excitement. - I'll talk to Andre about it. - Please, don't. I trust you. Don't tell him. I'll do it myself. Okay, I won't tell him. Good-bye. Don't worry. I'll come see you. Maybe not here. Andre saw a seaside house. I'd love to have a house by the sea. Doctor Ripault? This is Maulette. I need to see you about a patient of mine. I should say a friend. Yes, I suspect it's serious. Very serious. Good, all right. Thank you. Good-bye. Don't you mind taking a walk with a silent man? No. When two people are quiet, they have a lot to say. They try to guess each other's thoughts. It's very nice. Are you doing that now? I'm not thinking about anything. I feel too good. I'm very happy you've taken me out. That's all. You're not difficult. Just a walk on the beach, and you're happy, like a child. I wish I were still "like a child." When I was little, things were so simple. If I was happy, I'd laugh. If I was sad, I'd cry. - But now... - Now what? Now, it's not the same. I'm happy and unhappy. It's all become very blurry. Look. A starfish. Must have fallen last night. What's your name? What's yours? Mine? It's Andre. My name's Catherine. That's my given name. Everyone called me that. Father, mother, the whole family. "Catherine, elbows off the table. Catherine, say hello. Catherine..." It tingled my ears. It was funny. I kept thinking: "That's not your name, they call you that." So I found myself a name. - A new one. - For yourself? Yes. I used to think: "You'll say your name to the boy who loves you." Did you find that boy? No, I've met some men. One who died and my husband. So? They did like everybody else. They called me Catherine. I'll get the keys to visit it. Where's the house? Up there, by itself. Fancy visiting houses! - Come with me? - Yes. - It's dark here. - I'll open the shutters. - It's so secluded. - Yes. Nice spacious room. Reminds me of a film I saw long ago. A horror film, with ghosts. Everybody laughed, but I was very scared. Big armchairs like these ones. They remind me of the film. The girl sat in an armchair, screamed - and disappeared. - Nobody saw her? - Who? - The girl. I don't know. Maybe I'd disappear as well. Now, no silly thoughts. Women like me were made to disappear. Why? That's the way it is. We come in a raft, we go in a raft. Been married long? I hate that sort of question. Well done! That's a good answer. You're getting better. - What are you looking at? - The door. There are only bad doors here. The wind whistles in. Imagine! - You think about everything. - Have to. Of course... Where are you going? I'm curious, you know. Catherine... - Why did you call me? - I scared you? No, it felt funny. You sounded like my husband. He called me, I ran to him. It wasn't love. And he lied. Still, I'd come and he'd caress me. You miss that. What a brute you are! After all... - Maybe all men are brutes. - You're angry? No. Nice, a white bedroom overlooking the sea. Shut up! - Why? - Because. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Can't you tell me what's on your mind? It's easy though. I say everything I think. Everything! I'm not asking anything. Plus, I'm fed up. I really am. What am I doing here with you? It's mad! Look at me. Do I look like a womanizer? No. Bet it amuses you, a babbling man. I realize I'm babbling. Listen, you're wasting your time. I'm not into games. I'm a simple man. Simple men don't hide their thoughts. They're not ashamed of their desires. You're just like the other men. You have lots of scruples and you never stop thinking. Your present thoughts will never be known. Even if you wanted to speak, you couldn't. You'd babble away, to hide everything. Why are you saying this? What do you want from me? - Nothing. - Say it! You say everything you think, right? So what do you want from me? And you? What do you want? You. Stop talking. Kiss me. Kiss me. - Where's Captain? - No clue. Why? Not an SOS, but a sailboat in trouble. We need him. Mr. Kerlo, what's wrong? An SOS. Is Captain here? - No. - Where's he? Driving by the sea. - Around Creuzon. - Thank you. Been looking for you. What's the matter? - A sailboat in distress. - Sent an SOS long ago? The time it took me to find you. I'll go. Stop the winch! It's no use. What are you doing? It's pointless to go now, Captain. The Dutch has already hitched up. - How long ago? - Long enough. Is it you, Andre? - Is it you, Andre? - It's me. Kerlo didn't find you? Yes, he did. Wasn't it anything serious? A sailboat in distress. The Dutch rescued it. - The Dutch? - Yes. So, if you let them... You've quit? You've done it? No... The administrator... Have you spoken to him? Yes, I have. You didn't even ask for a holiday? Can't leave the ship and the crew. It's stronger than me. Yes, stronger than you. Actually stronger than me! I can't endure this life anymore. I'll get ill. Who gets ill like that? You promised me. - I just can't. - You don't understand? What if I were really ill? If I said "I need fresh air, I'm suffocating, open the window"? Would you stand there, stiff-lipped, and say "Impossible, must keep the window shut"? What do you mean? It can't be. You were smiling. - You're mad! - Daydreaming. I was watching you. You had a sparkle in your eyes. What's going on? - Don't be silly. - Don't leave me alone. You're here, but I'm alone. You try to be caring, but you can't. You're so cold. - I have worries. - Lucky you. Keeps you busy. I have no worries. I'm bored. I'm bored to death. Andre, do you still love me? You're complicated! It's easy. Just say "yes" or "no." You think I don't love you, as I love my job. What's all that to me? Your job, your ship, everything? The world might as well be flooded over, for all I care. Our life is in shambles. - Don't say that. Shut up. - I won't. I've been quiet for years. This is my SOS. You're right. Stroke my hair. I'm your wife, your property. You like owning things, don't you? Your crew, your ship, your wife... These things are in your hands. Any blemish, you open your hands. You like what's strong like you, what's new. The Albatross, your ship... when she was scrapped, you nearly broke down. But when you saw the brand-new Cyclone, you were in bliss. All over her, caressing her. - Shut up! - No, I won't. I've been unhappy too long. And I'm ill! If you were, you wouldn't be talking like that. Why didn't you say you were unhappy earlier? I was happy before, Andre. And I want that back. But I know you, you only think of yourself. I've only been waiting. It suited you. I can't take it anymore, I'm ill. Stop it! I've had enough of that illness bullshit. You're such a brute! - I hate you. Go away. - Say it once more... Once, 10 times, 20 times... Go away! Andre, where are you going? To my ship. That's not normal. He spends hours watching the floor or the ceiling. Lights a cigar, doesn't smoke. I ask him if he's hungry. No answer. Lemeur's right, he's weird. He's not weird. He's bored! Why? Any of our business? No, but we can't leave him like that. Why are you laughing? There's no answer to boredom. You hear me? None whatsoever. I've tried everything. - What is it? - Come on, Captain... I'm not hungry, pal. I want to be left alone! You're worried, so I worry too. Leave me alone, for God's sake! Say, Tanguy. You came to see me about your wife. You were wrong. And so was I, to give you advice. What goes on between two people, no one else can understand. You were waiting for me? Yes, I was. - What took you so long? - Lots of troubles. You don't see it coming, then it hits you. So I stayed in my cabin like a fool. I've thought about you. I've been thinking about you all the time. Have you? I like the storm. I could feel it coming, I felt stifled. Now I can breathe. I feel much better. Hold me in your arms. It's out. That's fine. They say lightning can strip you naked without harming you. You can do that as well. I need you, Catherine. Don't call me Catherine. Tell me the name you wanted for yourself alone. - Will you? - Yes... Aimee! You find it silly. I was little, I wanted to be loved. That's the best I could find: Aimee. What is it? It's a power cut. Apparently, it may last a while. There. Better than nothing, right? I've changed so much since I met you. I'm a new man. All I used to like and live for is now meaningless. Hard as I try, I can't be reasonable. In this weather, I'd be at sea with my crew. But I'm here, looking at you. And I'm happy. I'm very happy. All I care about now is not losing you. The storm brought me, remember? Now he's coming to get me. I know what he's crying out: "It's over. You've been happy too long. Now it's time to go." Why are you saying this? Because I can't live here without you. You have a life I can't be part of. I love you. Because I'm here today. I've spent two days thinking about you. What can I say about my wife? That was different. It was... It's over now. She knows it. She's told me so herself. You believed her? You pretended to because it suited you. No, for me it's much simpler. I've never been into having affairs. If it was an affair, I wouldn't be here. I'm here because I love you. You see, we'll be together. I don't want to let you go anymore. - What is it? - I don't know. I beg your pardon? Someone wants to speak to you. To me? - What's wrong? - Mrs. Laurent. I've come to tell you she's very ill. She's ill? She doesn't know I'm here. The doctor's with her. It's bad. She wants you. Doctor? Is she in danger? Here, Andre. Hurry up. What? Hurry up. I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know why... I thought he'd be here. Yes, he was here. I'll have to pack in the dark. Luckily I didn't unpack much. Are you leaving? There's a train at nine tonight. Will you still sail a lot with Capt. Laurent? I will. What else am I supposed to do? Plus, I like it with him. I'll ask you a favor. I'd be very happy to do something for you. Will you be seeing him every day? Yes. So you'll see if he's sad... if he's sad or unhappy. Unhappy people easily recognize one another. It'd be sad if we didn't. Give this to him. It's a starfish. I got it from him. He'll understand. But if you see he's happy, throw it in the sea. The starfish... Marie, you must be tired. I'm not, really. What's wrong? What's wrong with her? She's been ill for a while, but wouldn't tell you. - She got worse all of a sudden. - Is she in danger? She's weak. We gave her two injections. My darling... You can't imagine how happy I am. With you here, I'm better. Forgive me. You were right. I didn't realize how ill you were. But now I'll give it all up and we'll go south. It's warm and sunny down there, you'll get well quickly. Forgive me for having left you. It's normal to want to be alone. And I'd been so silly. Luckily, what we say when we're suffering doesn't count. I wanted to tell you... Get your head next to mine. And don't say anything. I'm ill, I have the right to speak. And I have so much to tell you, which I hid for fear you'd laugh. I love you so much, you can't imagine. You know, I was jealous. That made me suffer. Stop talking. When I saw other people and the way they love and live, I thought: "You're lucky. Andre is different. He's never cheated on you." I felt so happy, you can't imagine. Yvonne, you know... Don't be sad. I'm not sad now that you're here. I'm looking at you. I can see you. - Tell me? - Kiss me. Tell me you love me, Andre. Say you've always loved me. - What's happening? - We've just got a strange SOS. Yvonne! It can't be! Yvonne! It can't be! This isn't happening! I can't believe this! It can't be! Captain, an SOS. What do I care? An SOS... It's the Dutch. In distress, going onto the rocks. They're calling us. We can't let them down. What do you want me to do? The Dutch... Faithful Servant. I render you to Him who formed you from clay. Faithful Servant. May the army of Martyrs lead you into triumph. May the splendor of Saints be upon you. May the Virgins greet you. May the assembly of Patriarchs lift you into hope. Faithful Soul. Faithful Servant. - Soul of Your Servant. - Perils, grief and tribulation. As Elijah perished and as all men shall. Deliver her, Lord. Deliver Your Servant. As Noah from the deluge. Deliver her, Lord. Deliver, Lord... The soul of Your Servant. As Isaac from his father's hand. As you delivered Moses from the pharaoh, king of Egypt. As you delivered Daniel from the lions' den. So that you may escape the Darkness and the moanings of flames and the pain of torment. - Faithful Servant. - Faithful Soul. May the comforting Angels meet you and lead you by the hand. - Michael. - Gabriel. - Raphael. - Nathaniel... So that you may enjoy the sweet rest. So that you may be set in the Garden of Delights. So that your eyes may see the unveiled truth, in solitude. Stand by to go out. Ahead. 60 revs! THE END
