(celestial music) (somber music) (somber music) (somber music) (somber music) (somber music) (somber music) (knuckles rapping) [Dr. Vega] Hola, sleeping beauty. How are you feeling? Your parents should be here any minute now. You know, you shouldn't have done what you did, especially in school. Your parents were worried about you. They even turned back their plane. They don't care. [Dr. Vega] Parents make mistakes, like their children do too. You are a brave one. No, I'm not. [Dr. Vega] I am not a judge. But it seems to me like you're going through a tough time. I have a feeling it has something to do with school. You wouldn't understand. [Dr. Vega] Try me. You know, I went to school before. Yeah, like, a long time ago. Different year, different era. Everything's different now, doc. [Dr. Vega] Well, I guess it has been a little while since I've been in school. What's wrong? You should have just let me die. [Dr. Vega] You know I can't do that. Yeah, I know. It's your job. No one cares about me. I'm not smart or pretty. My parents are nearly here. I'm a total loser. Why did you save me? [Dr. Vega] That's what I signed up for, to save boys and girls like you. Like me? You don't know me. You don't know what I've gone through. I have been pushed and shoved around by others. I'm ugly. I'm being humiliated constantly just because I'm not like everyone else. But do I really need to be like everyone else just to not be pushed around? Do I really have to stop being myself and start being a jerk for them to stop? You don't know what being different is like. With all due respect, doc, you look like a person who's never experienced a situation like this in their entire life. You were probably the smarty pants and had plenty of attention in high school. [Dr. Vega] Well, Britney, that's where you're wrong. You're just a beautiful black rose. A black rose? What's that supposed to mean? [Dr. Vega] Can I tell you a story? Sure. What's it about? [Dr. Vega] I'm sure we have time. The story is about a beautiful girl, around your age. Me and her went to the same high school. [Britney] Wait, what about the black rose though? [Dr. Vega] I'm about to explain. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (phone clacking) (students chattering) All right, class, I want everyone to stay quiet and only speak when you're spoken to, all right? Uriel, why are you in detention? Too many tardies, Mrs. Parks. [Mrs. Parks] And you think this is funny, Mr. Vega? (laughs) No, no. I'm just smiling, I swear. (table banging) You! Yes, you. Oh, don't look at me like that. Sit up straight. Why are you here? I've never seen you before. (table banging) I asked you a question! Why are you in detention? Oh, so you're too cool to answer my question? Fine. I don't wanna hear you talking till the end of this hour. And this goes for everyone here. Blame her for my attitude. I'm not- - What did I say? Only speak when I tell you so. You had your chance. And you just earned yourself another detention, Miss? I am talking to you! Are you slow or something? Lawrence, Stephanie Lawrence, Mrs. Parks. (marker thudding) I'll be right back. If I catch anyone talking or out of their seat, they're gonna get an RPC followed with a three-day suspension, understood? (marker thudding) (students chattering) I like your drawing. That's a beautiful rose. You know what they say about a black rose? That it's beauty trapped in eternal darkness. Am I wrong? I'm Uriel. I Know. Oh, you speak. Yes, I speak, I just choose not to. And my drawing doesn't mean anything. It's just a drawing. They say what you draw is what you feel, an expression. [Stephanie] Can you just stop talking to me? I don't wanna get in any more trouble. [Uriel] She's not gonna be back until the end of the hour. She does that. Why are you in detention? Why are you so quiet with me? I haven't done anything to you. No, but you're one of them. One of who? One of those assholes who think that they can treat everyone like shit just 'cause they're popular or whatever. It's like you think that just because you're cool and you- - I'm not like them. I'm a little different, okay? Then why do you hang out with them? I guess because they're my friends. Look, I just wanna get to know you. I just wanna get to know why you're in detention. That's it. I see you going around, minding your own business, keeping to yourself, so. You know why I'm here. You were there. No. I wasn't. Yes, you were. Your friend Thelma took my chair at lunch when I got up for, like, two minutes. My bag was still hanging on the chair so I went to go claim my bag. I wasn't even claiming my chair. She wouldn't give it back so I called her Thiefma. She tried to throw it across the room so I snatched it and it broke her nail. She complained, and now I'm here. That was you? [Stephanie] Yeah. And now I'm getting death threats from her friends. And you're one of them. So if you'd like to keep your friends, I'd stay away from me. I don't know why they would do that. I think you're pretty. Sometimes that's what gets people to hate you. That's not my case though. Well, maybe I can talk to somebody and they'll lay off you for a little bit. And why would you do that? I was bullied in elementary school 'cause of my accent. So you ditched the accent and you became one of them. I guess I just learned how to fit in. [Stephanie] Right. And now, you're one of them. I'm not. I'm not. (ominous music) Hey. Why do you have those scars? (ominous music) (hand thudding) Uriel, why are you facing Stephanie? Were you guys talking? No. Mrs. Parks, I mean, look at her, she doesn't talk to anybody. Good. You just earned yourself an RPC and a suspension. I'm gonna have to talk to your parents, again. Sounds good. [Mrs. Parks] Keep it up. Pretty soon you'll be expelled. Detention is dismissed. (students chattering) Hey. Can I give you a ride home? No, thank you. You shouldn't have done that. It's just gonna bring us both problems. Ooh, Uri has it for the nerd. (laughs) You're trying to hit that? She's not that bad if you really think about it. And she'll do your homework for the rest of the year. Let me know how freaky she is. You know what they say about quiet girls. (Uriel scoffs) Mom? [Betty] Yes, baby. Why are you still with Roger? Because he puts food on the table and he pays our bills, baby. You could put food on the table and pay our bills too if you had a job. He won't let me work, you know that. Then leave him. Stephanie, Roger is your father. You have to accept that. He's not my father, mom. If he was, he wouldn't hurt me. [Betty] Again with these lies, Stephanie? Stop that. You need to respect him. Why can't I just go live with my real father? Because your biological father is a really bad man, okay? He's no good. I don't want you looking for him. I don't want you having any contact with him. Do you hear me? He can't be worse than Roger. I don't wanna hear it, Stephanie. Help me finish setting up for dinner. We need to have that table set before Roger gets here. Mom, why don't you believe me? I can't, Stephanie, all right? I can't. Why? Because then we'll be all alone. And you need a father. And I need a husband. Well, he's not my father, he's my stepfather. And I would rather be a bastard than have my dad sneaking into my room at night after you've fallen asleep every time he gets drunk. (ominous music) Enough! (hand slapping) (ominous music) (ominous music) Well, what's going on here? It's nothing. Nothing? Well, if it's nothing, why don't you get my goddamn dinner ready? I'm fucking starving! Please, do not make me come back in here again. Did you- - [Roger] Shh. (suspenseful music) Uriel, what are you staring at? Oh, you saw that? Uri just has the hots for the nerd. No, I don't. Really, Uriel? What, it's not like we're dating or anything, right? Are you serious? We've never been a thing. Am I wrong? (Thelma scoffs) She's mad, bro. I don't know why. You know Thelma. She wants everything her way. (scoffs) Whatever, man. I'm gonna go take a leak. (gentle music) (gentle music) What are you doing, Stephanie, just snap out of it. (gentle music) Did you do something different with your hair? I had to tie my hair because it was just going wild, really. Thank god- Is it hard to let go of? No. That's it. Fuck that bitch. Dude, guess who texted me. Same broad who- (rhythmic music) Where do you think you're going, bitch? Home. Where? To a dumpster? (ominous music) (books thudding) Yeah, Thelma, to a dumpster. I didn't do anything to you, okay? Just leave me alone. Yeah, nothing but being a whore. (students jeering) Dude, have you ever, like, played- - What's up, guys? Bro, what's up, (indistinct). Hey, you guys see that fight right earlier? Which ones? Thelma dragged that bitch all over the floor. Who? That one nerd. (laughs) Yeah? (Gabe sighs) She's probably just passed out somewhere. Shut the fuck up, Gabe. Why? I don't know what you're talking about. Why did you do that to Stephanie? Get off of me, Uriel, you're hurting me. Oh, is that her name? You know her name, Thelma. (scoffs) You're such a dick. Don't touch her again. What is it with you and that bitch anyway? You're the one acting like a bitch. Do not touch her again. I'm serious. Big words for a soft guy. (scoffs) That didn't stop you from trying to jump on my dick before. Chill, Uri. What the fuck, bro? What? You don't like it? Huh? Who want's to put their hands on fire for a whore? That's what I thought. (students jeering) (ominous music) Well, what happened to you? Nothing, Roger? Nothing? No, don't tell me nothing. Something happened. (ominous music) It is bruised. (book thudding) (ominous music) It wasn't there yesterday. I would know. (ominous music) [Betty] Roger, I was wondering if you could go to the store. We ran out of milk. What's going on? What do you mean what's going on? I'm just, yeah, I'm showing my stepdaughter some love. Yeah, look how beautiful she is. Roger, I already told you not to get so close to Stephanie. She doesn't like that. It makes her feel uncomfortable. Mom, it's okay. I'll just go get the milk for you. What? Are you trying to tell me what to do? No, no, no. No, I do as I please in this house! It is my house! You understand me? Mom, the money, I'll go get the milk. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, you let your mother go and get that milk. You're going to stay right here with me. No, it's okay, Roger, really. It's no big deal. I wanna go. I need the fresh air anyways. Eh? Well. Well, all right, all right, then off you go. Hey, but you don't forget your daddy's cigarettes. I'm not old enough to get them yet. You know that. Eh, that's right. You're not old enough for cigarettes. (laughs) Sometimes I forget. (ominous music) Steph! Hey. Steph. Hey. Are you okay? Just leave me alone, Uriel. Look, I'm sorry. You were right. Just not today, okay? Leave me alone, I'm having a shitty day. Shitty day? You don't look too good. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. But that's not for you to care, okay? So, please, I'm begging you, just leave me alone. I don't know how. Okay? I've tried. And every time I've tried, I can't get you out of my head. I don't know what it is, but I wanna know more about you. I care. Do you now? Prove it. Well, I'm here right now, aren't I? Why do you have those scars? It must be crazy, but I guess you can know a little more about me. My home life isn't exactly great. My mother thinks I'm a liar, I don't know my real father, and Thelma wants to kill me. Anything else you wanna know? These are nothing. And Roger. Who's Roger? My stepfather. I hate him so much. Did he do that to you? No. No, I did. He's sort of responsible though, but it's okay. It's not okay. What did he do to you? Promise me you won't say anything? Yeah. It started when I was five. It was my birthday. He said he wanted to give me a present. And the next thing I knew, I was locked in his room. I wanted to scream, but I was too scared. Did you tell anyone? Yeah, my mom. She doesn't believe me though. She's scared too. At first I thought you were out here 'cause of everything that happened with Thelma. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have told you all that. I just needed to get it out, I guess. No one else knows about this, Uriel, so just please don't say anything. It's okay, you can trust me. We'll see. So were you following me? No. I was just sitting at the bench and you happened to walk by. You sure you weren't waiting for me to walk by? - I- - Stalking me like a weirdo? (Stephanie laughing) I'm not sure anymore. (laughs) Sometimes I do feel like it gets too hard, and I'd wanna end it, and find that easy way out. But, I don't know, it just feels like I might still have a purpose, like, I'd be leaving something behind. So I just end up cutting a little, deep enough for it to bleed but not deep enough to die. I'm scared to die. I'm a coward. You're not a coward. I think it makes you tough. And, I mean, the fact that you can sit there and have faith and hope that it's gonna get better. I just think about everything that I've gone through and how long it's going to keep happening, and I just, I get scared. And then I feel like a coward. So there I am again, trying to end the problem. You're not a coward. Like, look at this. Look at what we're doing right now. We're sitting at a pond with a bunch of ducks on a bench, and I like it. And I know the way that we met wasn't very bright. And I'm sorry, but once the rain falls and the clouds open up, you'll always get to see a beautiful sky. I mean, see, that right there. That's beautiful. That I can compare to a beautiful sunrise after a dark stormy night. That's what I'd consider beautiful. Why? Why what? Why are you here? Why are you so nice to me? I don't know. Is that, like, your favorite phrase or something? (laughs) Honestly, I just really think you're pretty and I admire you. You admire me? What do you admire about me? I'm a loser, remember? See, but that's where you're wrong. You're you. Every time I see you, you're you. You don't pretend to be somebody you're not. You don't fake it to be cool and fit in. You're who you are, and that's special to me. You're special, and I like that. I like you. It's only fair that I opened up to you. Well, I should probably go. My mom's probably calling, wondering where I am. Okay. Well, next time we hang out, can we do it at school? No. You know how that ends for us. Look, I'll stop hanging out with them if I have to. I like hanging out with you more. You don't have to do that. I low-key want to. I didn't realize the monster I became hanging around with those guys. And honestly, I can be who I am with you. I don't have to pretend. And I don't know, I'm hoping I can get 'em to understand. Okay, well, until then, let's just keep meeting outside of school. Okay. Okay. Hey, Steph. What? (gentle music) Can you promise me something? What is it? That you never hurt yourself or call me if anything happens. Okay, I promise. Just stop saying it out loud? Right. Sorry. I'll see ya. I'll see ya. (somber music) (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music) (upbeat music) (lighthearted music) (upbeat music) (lighthearted music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music) (gentle music) I'm gonna get a black rose. What are you doing here all alone? I don't know, avoiding people. It's that nerd, isn't it? (Uriel sighs) Sorry. I meant that girl. Her name's Stephanie. And yeah, don't tell anyone either. If you do, man, I'm never talking to you again. What is it about her? I mean, she's got a nice face. But other than that, her clothes are old fashioned, she's always all raggedy, and she smells like cigarettes. Her face, her smile, her way. And she doesn't smell like cigarettes, Gabe. Smells like something. See, that's the problem. You guys are so quick to judge. You have zero idea what anybody's going through. Do you really think she chose that life? Do you really think that that's the life that she wants to be in? Are you kidding me? I mean, for fucks sake, she sits there and deals with all this shit at home and then she has to come to school and deal with you guys. Wow. You're really into her. See, but it's not just that. You guys are such assholes too. I mean, I can't believe that I would keep you guys that close to me. I don't even trust you anymore at this point. What's wrong with her? You don't care. No, I mean, I need to know what we're talking about. I don't know. You can't tell anybody about this. I'm serious. Come on, bro. I'm your best friend, remember? She's having troubles at home. She has an abusive stepfather. What do you mean, like, sexually? What did I just say? Man, don't tell anybody. You know what, I can't tell you shit. What's wrong? Nothing. I don't wanna talk about it. I just, I gotta get it out. It's okay. It's not okay. We have to find a way to get you both out of there. You think I don't want to? If I do anything, then my mom pays the consequences, okay? It's happened before. I get threatened every day. And if I take action, this happens. I let it happen to me so it doesn't happen to her. But you gotta do something. I mean, you can't just keep dealing with this every single day. I'll take care of it, okay? My dad, he has a gun at the house. And I can grab it and we can just say it was self-defense or something. I'll be right back. Uriel, please, just, okay? You'll make things worse. But we have to do something. Your drawing? Keep it. It's yours. Why? You were right before. I lied to you. It did mean something. Steph. Please don't do anything stupid. You promised. I know. We'll fix this. Thank you. Hey. Have you seen Uriel? He's been avoiding me for a while. Yeah, I just spoke with him. Well, what did he say? Is he still coming over tonight? I don't know. I doubt it. He's probably just gonna go hang out with that nerd. I guess he's too humble for us now. What? He's hanging out with her? What is it with him and that bitch anyway? I guess he just feels bad for her 'cause her dad sexually abused her. (ominous music) She what? (suspenseful music) That didn't come from me. Mr. Roman, since this is health class, shouldn't we be talking about sex education? Like, for example, when is a good time to lose your virginity? No, Thelma, please stop doing whatever you're trying to do. Just do your work. Oh, but I can go first. I lost mine in my freshman year. Thelma, that's none of our business. Whatever you do in your personal life, that's your- - But there are some people in this room who lost theirs when they were nine, eight, seven, six, five, I don't know, maybe even younger. [Mr. Roman] Thelma. Right, Stephanie? What are you talking about? I don't know. You tell me. Both of you, enough. I don't know what you're talking about, Thelma. And the worst part is you kept it in the family. (ominous music) [Mr. Roman] Thelma, out of my class now. (students chattering) (eerie music) Thelma! Go to Mrs. Park's office now. Fine. But it's not my fault that she has daddy issues. (door bangs) I said go. Why are you still here? Get out. (students chattering) (ominous music) Looking for daddy issues? She's long gone. Ran to her trashcan little home, to daddy. (ominous music) (faucet creaking) (water sloshing) (water sloshing) (ominous music) (somber music) (somber music) (ominous music) (somber music) (Uriel breathing heavily) (doorknob rattling) (door thudding) Steph! Steph! (Uriel grunting) (door thuds) No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Steph, Steph. Hey, hey. Hey, it's me! Hi. Hey, it's okay. We're okay. We're okay. I'm here. It's okay. It's okay. There you go, hi. Look at me. Pay attention to me, to me. Look at me. There you go. You promised. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. You let me down. You let me down like everyone else. No, all I told Gabe was that you had an abusive father. That was the, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Here, look at me. Right there, right here, you remember detention? (laughs) You didn't even wanna talk to me. There you go. I would never do anything to hurt you. I just told them so they'd leave you alone and get a little bit more perspective, that's it. I promise. Please. You have to believe me. Promise? Of course, my little black rose. Of course. Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me. Hey, right here, right here, right here. Look at me. You remember all that crap I gave you for that drawing? You didn't even wanna talk to me. It's okay. I love you. I love you so much. (gentle music) My little black rose. You love me? Of course. Hey. Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steph. Steph. (ominous music) (water sloshing) (somber music) (Uriel sobbing) Hey. Hey. Hi. I love you too. (ominous music) No, no. (sobs) No, no, no, no. Hey, wait, wait, wait. (sobs) Wait. (sobs) Please. (sobs) Please. (sobs) Please. (sobs) (head banging) (sirens blaring) You are such an asshole. I'm sorry. I didn't know that she was gonna- - [Thelma] Uriel, relax. It's not that big of a deal. What did you say? What the fuck did you just say? (ominous music) She was a waste of sperm, Uriel. What? What are you gonna do? Hit me? (suspenseful music) (scoffs) He can't hit a girl. (punch thudding) I hope you change, Thelma. I really hope you do, because in this world, you don't leave without paying. You will remember me. You will remember Stephanie. Actually, no. Forget I ever existed. I don't ever wanna see either of you again. Fine. No one ever needed you. And no one ever will. She did. She did. (sighs) Leave that alone. She's gone. My baby was telling the truth. (ominous music) What are you talking about? (ominous music) And I never listened. I'm a bad mom. I'm such a bad mom. (diary thudding) (Roger grunting) (gun clicking) (Uriel breathing heavily) (sirens blaring) (knuckles rapping) (suspenseful music) He's over there. (guns clicking) (Roger grunting) Oh, you, how dare you do this to me after all I've done for you and your worthless, dirty, slutty daughter! (sobs) (sirens blaring) (Uriel breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (Uriel sobbing) (car engine rumbling) So what happened? Did Roger go to jail for life? [Dr. Vega] (laughs) Well, not really. He didn't even last a day. He was raped and murdered when the other prisoners found out that he was a pedophile. How do you know? [Dr. Vega] Well, my father was one of the guards. He told me everything that happened that day. He said the prisoner that stabbed him had tears in his eyes, but he was already doing life anyway. Did you know Uriel and Stephanie well, Dr. Vega? [Dr. Vega] (laughs) You could say that I knew them well, really well. What about the two bullies, the boy and the girl? You never did tell me their names. And what happened with Uriel? (suspenseful music) Hola, Thelma, Gabriel. Mom, dad! You're here. Meet Dr. Vega. He's really awesome. He was just telling me this really sad, crazy story about some teens he knew in high school. I'm so sorry, baby. Your daughter's doing much better. She lost a lot of blood, but we had enough compatible with hers. Thank you, man. I really appreciate what you did for our daughter. Thank you so much, Uriel. (mysterious music) I don't know how I can ever repay you. (bright music) Be there for your daughter. She needs you now, more than ever. In a few minutes or so, a nurse will come in and give you guys some paperwork to fill out. She's also getting recommended psychiatric treatment as well. You guys should go. And there are more important things than work, eh, Gabriel? You're right, Uriel. I'll do that. Goodbye, princess. Remember what I told you. (melancholy music) [Stephanie] I can't ever forget this date. You're my first date ever. (phone ringing) (ominous music) Dr. Vega. How old? 14? I'm on my way. (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (melancholy music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
