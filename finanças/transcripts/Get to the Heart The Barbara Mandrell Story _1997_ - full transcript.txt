She doesn't knowwhat she's doing.You doing here? She doesn't know whoor where she is. Now as hard as thisis to watch, Ken, Barbara's behavior istypical of head injuries. A combination of pain,medication, trauma--it's pretty unpredictable. Get out!Get him out! I know this doesn'tmake any sense, but I'll just advise youto stay out of her sight.

Will you takeme to my bedroom?I need to lay down. Mm-hmm.you betcha. Your mother needs and wantsyou to be close to her. Now take your homeworkand go in. She loves meto death one minute and yells at me the next. No, sir. I'm not going anywherenear her again today. Jaime? It's a cold, darkdungeon in her room. She stinks from medicineand all she does isstare at the TV. Jaime. Yes, sir. Hold it. You and I need to talk. I've been getting notes, calls from your teachers. Your grades are dropping. Who cares? Grades don't matter. Nothing matters anymore. What are you talking about? The way you liveis no way to live-- acting like mom's servant, having her yell and scream at you all day. She never speaks a civilword to you, dad. Never. She doesn't mean it. Look, at first she didn'teven recognize us. Now she does. But she is stillin a lot of pain. She can't helplashing out.. But she is stillbut she onlyin a lot of pailashes out at us. Because she can. Because she knowsthat we will allow it. You've got to understand,matthew, that your mother is usedto having control. But now her body is tied downand her spirit is raging at the onesshe loves the most. The irony is that she needs us nowmore than ever. Theif you want to be the rock and take it, but I just can't do it. That's nice writing,jaime. Thank you, mommy. - What's all that?- That is your mail from fans who careabout you, who care aboutbarbara mandrell. I am not Barbara mandrell.Get that out of here. Jaime, that hurtswhen you lean on me. I didn't meanto hurt you. I didn't. Barbara, you knowthat I love you more than anythingin this entire world. But I just can'tunderstand how somebody who had never beenafraid of anything is now afraid of life. Barbara:There is not one minue in a dy that I do not have pain. I look in the mirror and I don't recognizethe woman who looks back. But I know she scaresher own children. She even scares herself. Ken, I can't evenpray anymore. Honey. It is not alwaysgonna be like this. You have got to lookahead to the future. It is not ai can't face a futuregonna bfilled with so much pain. Sometimes I wonder if I can facethe future at all. Dear god, please look down on mommy. Please make her better. Please. Make her love us again. I'd like to get aholdof whoever wrote this -and squeeze their neck. - Good. Daddy, now that we havethat settled, I just wantto go back to sleep. Don't you see, honey? With you herew that we havethere's no way thatjust wantanybody can know the truth. You need to makea public appearance. With you herew that we havei don't want to makeust wantan appearance.Ow the truth. I just wantto go back to sleep. But folks, they need to knowthat you're okay, honey. Daddy, I can't go anywhere. You don't hae to go anywher. They want youto make an appearance at the countrymusic awards. But you'd do it fromto here by satellite. Daddy, I can't. I don't feel good. I mix up my words.I can't remember anything. But you don't hae to remembe. We'll get the questionsin advance and we'll write up youranswers in big letters. You don't have to remember.You just have to read it. I know being a celebrityI'm at their mercy...

You have no choice if youthis iwant to recovercality. Your lossesfrom your insurance. Why doesn't ourinsurance company justpay us what it owes? We've paid our premiums,why do we have to sue? In the best of worldsthey will. But this is notthe best of worlds. This is tennesseeand it's the law. I won't do it.I won't do it. You have 365 days fromthe accident to take action.
