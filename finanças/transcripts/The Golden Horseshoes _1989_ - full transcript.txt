Ahmed Baha Eddine Attia presents Golden Horseshoes A film by Nouri Bouzid Your horse is too sensitive. Neglected, he gets depressed. But he's harmless. He must be isolated. He will stay with us in the garage. You'll get better soon. You can forget about racing. We'll get him better, then to the slaughterhouse. God bless us. Youssef Soltane, you are hereby banished forever. Hichem Rostom Hamadi Zarrouk Michket Krifa and Chadia Azzouz Photography: Youssef Ben Youssef Sound: Faouzi Thabet Editing: Kahena Attia Music: Anouar Braham Scenario and dialogue: Nouri Bouzid Watch out, the chair is broken. Don't worry, I'm a man. Money for oil for fire. Ashura, it's Ashura! That's Youssef, he lives here. He's nice. I'll tell the teacher on you! - He's been sacked. - You'll see! I'd like to see that too. Idiot! Raja. Fatma? You're late. The children stayed up waiting for you to come. You took so long. We were worried. Youssef? What a surprise. Come in, your mother is in her room. Our house is empty, like a funeral. Each winter, I don't think I'm going to make it. You've come with the rain. That's a good sign. Your hair is wet. I'll dry your coat. Come closer. Your face is cold. My legs are too weak to walk to your house. It's not my house. I can't hear you. Where are my prayer beads? They were right here. Does anyone smoke here? He comes in like a thief. Who? Sghaier. He still lives here? Where can he go? He just stays in the basement. Youssef? Where's little Youssef? He's driving me crazy! I've been looking for you for an hour. - Do you love me? - Yes. - How much? - A lot. Very very much? Don't tell your father, he'd kill us. Have you seen Abdallah? He hardly ever comes. It's as if you weren't brothers. It makes me sad. I've been busy. You didn't even come when Fatma died. Your father was kinder. Abdallah used to come sometimes. You'll get to taste my cooking tonight for Ashura. The children are late... Are they usually late? Mariem and Adel are at your place. Mariem! What a surprise! Come in. He'll be so happy to see you. Youssef, your daughter's here. It's your birthday. Thank you. 45 years, I must be getting old. You've become a beautiful woman. I've missed you. I'm glad you came. Stay and taste what I've cooked. You cook? How are the others? I came to talk about Adel. Adel? Why didn't he come? And Raja? Adel wants to study in France. He wanted to tell you himself. He needs permission and money. If you can. Where would I get the money? Bring me the key from my room. Daddy's here! Make me a dress for my doll like Mariem's. We can never count on you. We almost didn't have dinner. You can't take care of your own children, let alone your own country. Discussing politics at the bar. The bar was closed. Don't take away my one joy. Your father used to say you were a good for nothing. And you? You're good regardless. I forgot. People came by looking for you. Who? I don't know, but they were scary. If they return, tell them you didn't see me. A girl without love is like a palm without fruit. I am an Arab, and my people have sworn my downfall. Ever since their mother died, no one has come into this room. Hello. Your friend Raouf was arrested. We'll find you Youssef, wherever you hide. Who told you about Raouf? Your students. They fought for you. You have a radio? I need some Arab clothes so that I can go out. Go out? I don't have a choice. The police are everywhere. I need a key. The years pass and the days get longer. Talking about it didn't help. After 25 years, you realize that you have nothing. Even yours dreams are forbidden. You love the impossible. Those magical words: Socialism, Nasserism, Marxism. But they slipped through your hands like grains of sand. What you thought was great turned out to be useless. Those who speak of their victories are all losers. Go through everything. No pencils or books. Give me the pencil. - You'll get me in trouble. - You need a doctor? You want to mess everything up. "Run over the waves, "you bastard horse, you sacred horse." Dad! Raja. You've grown. You look younger. You can write in Arabic? Why haven't you been to see me? A picture of me as a child to remember me by. You're going away again? If you find me a husband, you'll be on your feet in no time. Good, I'll find you one. You used to carry me on your back. Were you tortured? I cried when I heard that. I feel torn apart. Let's get together. You won't want to put up with us now that we're grown. Who are they? Friends. We're putting on a play. You want to see me acting? Acting? Why didn't you tell me? You're impulsive. I want you to go... to go in the right direction! That's all I can do. Too bad. She wants to see you. She's a pain in the neck. Show your elders some respect! My night's ruined! They're gone. Stop it. Why didn't you come to the funeral? You left us when you left her. I thought you'd be pleased to see me acting. Each word revives the pain. You give us some money and think you own us! Give me a cigarette. Did he guess? I didn't say anything. Raja. Open the door! Raja, close the door. Why are you crying? Smile, don't be sad. Poor Gramsci. - Fatma, make them keep quiet! - Do it yourself. - They won't listen to me. - Let them play. I need to work in silence. You made me quit my studies so you could tell me what to do? No I didn't. I'm against women staying at home. I can't work like this! No, but I can! I started sweeping early in the morning, or is this not work? Talk about sweeping. You're always sweeping. I don't even know where to put my feet! Make sure you put them in the right place. This is my house and I want it clean. Go to your students! I was crazy to have children. Anyone could have them. Big deal. Lift him. Where are my papers? This is the coat you gave me. I'm ok. Sleep here. Zineb doesn't know. She'll be worried. This will make you feel better. I'm not sick. Where are my children, Mariem and Adel? Are they in trouble? Are you hiding something? This is a madhouse. Where are they? Are they looking for them? Are they hiding? Are they with the fundamentalists? Adel is with Ferid Ayari. Get your things. You're coming with me. I'm not going. - Is this how I raised you? - You raised me? Tell her about the divorce, about what her mother did to me. She was right! Don't I have a right to live here? - You went away with Zineb. - Shut up! He speaks ill of my mother, yet she only just died. I won't leave this house. I've never been free. Did I wake you? I can't sleep. I came home early. If I'd known... Didn't you go to work? I don't like the job you found me. I can't do office work. Take a vacation, have some rest. I've had enough of that. You should get out more, meet new people. I don't want to see anyone. Sometimes I miss prison. I heard they're sending you back. To prison? To university. Fat chance. Did you see your children? No. I can't see Fatma. I'm ashamed... to face them. You worry over nothing, like a child. At times I feel that I want to be neither father nor child. But I miss them. They could come visit you, or even live here. That's easy to say. I'm tired. I need to teach in the morning. Not now. I don't feel like it. Why don't you? I just dont. Let's not argue. I mean nothing to you. You treat me like an object. You've changed since you left prison. Then why let me into your home, into your bed? Why did you let me dream of you for six years? Why did you write to me? Things have changed. You want me to live in a prison too? You've let yourself go. You don't even wash anymore. Am I any dirtier than your other lovers? Is that why you don't feel like it? My life is none of your business. I don't belong to anyone. You couldn't have spent six years all alone, with those men lurking around. You have no right to judge me. Who do you think you are? The conscience of the world? A prophet from God? The conscience of the world... A prophet from God... Before, you were free. I've never been free. You want to get rid of me. That's not true. But your politics bore me. - Send me back to prison. - It's not me who'll send you. - You're wrong. - Yes, I'm wrong! Everyone knows you're a failure. I've introduced you to my friends for nothing. Which of them helped me when I was in prison? The Left is no longer fashionable when things get tough. They replaced me as soon as I was gone. You've just been playing with me! An intellectual. The fire is out. You're crazy. You were born on the hot sand. and grew up with the mountains. Your father is made of stone and your mother is a poem. Then they tamed you and made you sick. They took away your zeal and rode on your back. You fought wars for others. They crossed mountains on you. Run over the waves, you bastard horse, you sacred horse. Who is it? I can't see who it is. Mr. Youssef, is that really you? The power's been cut. It's good to see you, Sghaier. I came for a cup of your tea. You've come back to bless us with your presence. Ten years of prison in one go. Who else served that time? Only six years. And the years you were in hiding? You're smart, you scared them. Am I that scary? You're still in the Indochina war? You lost it for them? They won thanks to me. It's as if I hadn't been away. Nothing has changed. The people have changed. The Medina is like a beautiful, young woman that everyone wants. Then when she gets old, they leave her for someone new. These are new! Who lives here now? Those who want company, the poor. Excuse me. I don't understand why my dad yelled at me. I brought your things. Were you lonely? Here's your costume. I passed on the message. They haven't replied yet. Why do you care so much about the workers? Don't get angry. I was just asking. I can't go to your house. Don't go. Why? Are you married? I just got divorced. A small man named Sghaier lives in the basement of my house. He'll give you my things. And you? Are you married? Are you with anyone? Head to the walkway. Hurry up. Remember when you used to come down here to hide? No cheating, no tricks. Open you eyes and put your finger in a gap. Trying to trick me? That's how you win. You fought the State and you're afraid of a game? Decide, but without cheating. You lost! Let's play again. How many packages did I bring you in prison? And the poems? Didn't those foreigners teach you how to play? They would never let me visit you. Follow the string's path. You put your finger and I'll pull. I won. This string is good luck! You make money doing this? I have your secrets. I swear, nobody has seen them. Did you have to bring this up? Raouf, don't go out! You come from the desert, yet you want to rule us? Welcome, enlightened ones. I told them prison doesn't destroy politicians. You think so? We heard you'd been tortured but didn't talk. Who said that? I have secrets too. Touch it. Don't press on it. It's a bullet. I got it from Indochina. They used to call me Bullet. At least you have something in your belly. I took it to the battle of Bizerte. But we had no guns. We sang "Bizerte is ours" and then came back. I was in Bizerte too, in prison. - We missed our chance. - Your chance hasn't come yet. You're a politician. The world is waiting for you. You can wait. The wine's all gone. - Did you return to your home? - No one remembers me there. I haven't been back since my father died. They found him dead by the fire. If look for another bottle. Mr. Youssef. I told them I had a guest and they gave me a bottle. What is the "Perspectives"? Where are the printers? Are you the brains behind it? Talk, and we'll set you free. A cigarette? Here. Get up. March. You want power? All you can do is write. I can kill as many of you as I like. You think you're a man? Piss on him. You'll leave your manhood here. You work in politics? I'm going to wipe all the color off that dirty face. Mr. Youssef. No cheating, play calmly. Place your finger. Double if you win. You missed. Let's play some cards. Zineb. Close the door. Mr. Youssef, are you ok? We missed the street. They all look the same. I'll be back. I need some perfume. He's fainted. It's bad blood. Bring him in. You're lucky you're not married. I haven't found anyone yet. I can't marry myself. You need a woman, but not to marry. Nana and Raouf are right. She sticks to my skin. She holds on tight. I can't take it. They keep hitting me... until I can't feel it. I faint. They knock me down and hit me with a stick. I bend down. They pour cold water on me. I shiver. The pain comes back, and they start all over again. But why? Pure sadism, to break my will. Raouf refused to talk about it. He talked about you in prison. You kept us company. I'm glad you've come. In the winter we get bored. It's been two years since we go out of prison. We came here directly. I left Raouf here. He was happy. He was happy, but afterwards... He didn't want to see anyone. He got a passport and left. He left you alone? I'm a link between two prisons. Plenty of men around. You only have to snap your fingers. Men? I haven't had any luck. Solitude makes you miss prison. Raouf used to say that. What's that? They burnt us with cigarettes. I can't. What has come over you? Look, I'm as Italian as you're a man. You have a game? Pull. You cut it. It's cold. Your house isn't warm anymore. Lack of men. Where's Raouf? Not even Nana knows where he is. His friends are all gone. Nana's house is cold and empty. Who are you writing for? I don't understand you, Raouf. Who'll read your book? You're wasting your time. Poor Sghaier, he just plays with them. Has he ever made it with a woman? Call him. Nana wants to play the string game with you. Show me. Don't be angry. I don't feel well. Your bullet must be wet. The heights make me dizzy. I'm going to head back home. Put me down. I told you that I can't take heights. You're acting like a child. Everything has its place. Was Nana's hand in the right place? You should be proud she touched you. But in front of people? I didn't come to be touched. You still cling to your old ways. How did you come to Tunisia? Have you forgotten? Wasn't it you who brought me? I don't suppose anyone noticed. Mistakes are forgiven on the night of Ashura. First with Raja, then with me. Did Raja complain about me? If you only knew how she defended you when you were in prison. So what? Can't I be wrong? I'm sick of hearing about prison. Always telling me what to do. You keep quiet about all those opportunists, but expect me to answer for every word I say. What do you want from me? I wasn't made to live in prison. I'm not the conscience of the world nor a prophet from God. Are you proud of yourself? You can't even keep a home. What's the matter? Run over the waves, you bastard horse, you sacred horse. You're afraid that time will slip away. If only you'd made your voice heard. If your fingernails were like knives. If you had a horn, you'd lift the country on it. And it would move when you told it to. If your hands hadn't been cut by your ancestors. You'd have put the sky on them. You'd have blown away the thunder. And evaporated the clouds. With your magic, you created the earth. But you have a good heart. The reins are against your neck, nothing will ever stop you. Run over the waves, you bastard horse, you sacred horse. Careful, the police. Even the bars are going crazy, closing up at eight. Let me out. Your car is dangerous. - Where do you want to go? - To my basement. Watch where you're going. This car is a wreck like its owner. Raja was defending me against whom? Your brother Abdallah. He kept insulting you. He didn't let me in the house. He wanted me to stop drinking. But what am I without my bottle? And all those long robes. The girls were suffocating. Turn, little pigeon. What's this racket? What are you doing? Put her down. Come here. - You have no shame? - I'll tell my dad. Uncle hit me on the hand. Stop laughing. Your daughter spread her legs over the shoulders of a boy. I've told you not to hit her. The rod is from heaven. And where are you from? What did Fatma say? Don't talk about the dead. She fell ill after you divorced her. You shouldn't have brought these pamplets with you. If they catch us, we're done for. They're for my novel. I even wrote about you. About me? About my bullet? Leave it. You want us to be laughingstocks? Good old Sghaier. Remember how your father used to look at me? He hit me once when he caught me singing. He wanted you to know some things must be done in secret. Shall we go in? Let's have a smoke. If it weren't for you, I'd still be in my shell. - Remember those songs? - How could I forget. - Learn any other songs in prison? - Many. Will you teach them to me? I going to see my son Adel. I'll be back. Mr. Youssef. Adel hides his pain. Don't be hard on him. Is Adel Soltane here? I don't want to see him. - Who? - My father. Is Adel Soltane here? It's been so long that he's probably forgotten me. He comes by sometimes. Where are you taking me? I'm tired. I'm tired too. I forgot about Sghaier. Where are you going? You forget your tears? Pity. I've so many things to do. Adel. My son... Praise Allah. Allah is one. In the name of God. Zineb? She left again. With who? I like your beard. So they won't recognize me. I'm afraid they'll catch you. But I'm already caught. You can't deny it. These were in your house. A thinker. Of what? What do you have left? They didn't even let you write. Politics is easy when you keep a straight line. But the winding path... I'm glad I've found you. Know who came with me? Who does Mariem live with? Wait for me! I've the money for you to study to France. The road by the sea. One of us will win? You lost. I should have stayed at home. Does she live alone? Who's here so early? Is Mariem here? Are you crazy? Come on girls. Mariem is going to learn the Koran. We thought you were our savior. Without your culture, we'll find our way. "Here are the guidelines of the president." Abdallah. Big brother. I was hoping to see you again. Your knife is still sharp. And so is your tongue. You stink of wine. - You should try it. - God forbid. - Did you give them their pension? - Paid from your inheritance. Adel is going to study in France. He needs the money. Will he be a francophone like his father? Can't you see he's just looking for a good time? He'll mess around in the Bois de Boulogne, and come back with a fake diploma and full of diseases. He wants to get away from you like I did. Like father, like son. You want to throw away all of father's inheritance? You're a miserable son. Others save money, you waste it. You save it. I'll sell you my share. I'll accept, for father's sake. I'm going through hard times. I'll tighten my belt and buy you out. As you wish, but I need the money now. Marien threw money in my face. A girl dared to humiliate me! Poor you. If you still had any faith left, you'd forbid Raja from acting. She's making a fool of herself. You always enjoyed watching. I don't want it in my house. They take off their veils, they open the door to anyone, they laugh so loud that everyone can hear them! And you pray for them! Take them with you. They're worthless. Who will marry them? That's none of your business. I should've... punished these dogs and cast them out. Don't you dare touch them! What a pity, you poor man. You're a shell of your former self. You're letting a woman control you. Me? You and your leftists have been wiped out. You think you know the country. You, and those like you, think you can rule this country. Revolutionaries, Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyists, Maoists, Nationalists, Democrats, Unionists, Destourians, Nasserites, Arab Nationalists! And the Fundamentalists! You've destroyed the country. You've turned politics into religion, where there's no room for doubt. - And I need to doubt. - Demagogy. I want to be able to dream, to falter, to be sensible, I don't want to feel dead. Demagogy. You'll always be a loser. I gave ten years of my life so others could speak. Big deal! You never learned to speak! Politics is not words. You're doom is certain, you're all atheists. Yes, I am an atheist! Don't I have the right to dream without you tearing me down? "In the name of Allah." You have a scar for every time you were killed. If you don't die of shame, you'll die of inertia. Give them to me if they're not in Arabic. They're in Arabic. Then you must burn them so as not to defile God. Ashura, in the Holy Book, coincides with the salvation of prophets. Noah saved from the flood, Abraham from the fire, Moses from the Red Sea, Jonah from the whale, Adam cast out of Paradise, and Muhammad's arrival in Medina, following the flight from Mecca. In the name of Allah, the greatest. I heard you coming from afar, among the paths and domes, with the sound of your horseshoes. You lose your mind on the pavement. You throw away the saddle and run. You leave the square without a statue of a horse. Have you forgotten? Would you be surprised to know that the iron and nails in your horseshoes were made of gold? Run over the waves, you bastard horse, you sacred horse.
