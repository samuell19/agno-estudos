- Uh, Amber Bradshaw, you're up. - Oh, um, sorry. Do you mind watching these for me? - Sure. - Show time for you? - I wish. - Hi there. What can I get started for ya? - I'll have a Diet Coke if you don't mind, Evangeline. - Sure thing, Amber. - You know, actresses shouldn'thave that type of drink because the carbonation alone can really cause weight gain. - So, you're saying I'll get fat drinking Diet Coke? - I'm saying you should stick to lemon water. You know how the industry is. - Uh, right. - Anyway, how was your audition? - Giant cockroaches. - Run! They're coming for us! And John, I love you, too! Oh, sorry, that's me. Oh no! Agh, they're gonna get me! Audition, oh, yeah, um, yeah, it went well. - Good. So are you ready for another one? I trust your mother sent you the script? - I looked through it. Character's name is Jennifer. Same old damsel in distress plot. - You know, you really shouldn't approach a role with that kind of careless stereotyping. - Well, I mean it's just the writers usually do. This role is just confined to their preconceived tropes. You know what's funny? Only men were in the audition room making the decision. Don't you think that's strange? Uh, wrong? - You realize that I get paid whether you waste my time or not or whether you take this seriously or not, and I'm not the one that you're gonna have to answer to for wasting the money. - Yeah. Uh, so, this character. - Yeah. Jennifer is outraged at Josh for his illicit behavior. Why don't we do an improv where you're confronting that one person that you're outraged the most? - Okay, so, just um, talk to somebody who makes me mad? - Uh, not just anyone. That one person that drives a stake through your heart. What would you say to them? - Um, you never understood me, you never cared for what I wanted. - Really? This is how you're going to confront somebody? I mean, come on, come on, let it out. Be true to your emotions. Be aggressive. Let it out, let it out. - You never cared about what I want! It's all about you! It's always been about you! I have one life to live, okay? And I'm not gonna waste it. This is your dream and I'm gonna follow my own. - Are you okay? - Don't touch me. Was that good? - It was a bit over the top. - Come on, we need to put this jacket on. Come on. - I don't like the color! - Baby, you wanna make Mommy happy, don't you? Besides, this color looks great on you. Come on. Here we go. - Hey, hey! Hey, are you okay? What happened in there? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You forgot your guitar. Look, I can see you're going through something right now. But, it's gonna be okay, it's gonna be perfect. - Yeah? - Tonight? - Yeah? - It's gonna be awesome. - 'Cause we'll be together. - Exactly. - I'm sorry, this stupid thing. - It's okay. I got to get to work anyway. I'll see you tonight. - Okay. - It's gonna be great! - Yes. Great. Hello? - Amber, I have been trying to get a hold of you all day! How did your audition go? - Uh, it went well. - Remember, this is a big role and it pays incredibly well. We need it. I've already talked to the producer and they are confident in you. You just need to be at the audition this Tuesday. You will be there. Right, pumpkin? - Yeah. I'll be there. - Fine, bye. - Hey, you. - Oh, hey! - So what's this? - What? - Nashville, Tennessee. Okay, that's random. - Just hear me out on this one, Sam. - Okay, so your audition went so bad that you're running away? For real? - It's not running away. I don't know. I've had it with other people telling me how to live my life. - You mean Patricia? - And, I'm sick and tired of others telling me what to do. - Just like Patricia. - And I'm through taking orders from people. No more. - Drum roll. Patricia. Agh! I think that's your problem. But, I mean, what doesNashville have to do with this? - It's Music City USA. - And it's super duper far away. - And adventurous! - And really expensive. - And where I need to be, Sam. - And, you can go to Los Angeles instead. - Oh, I'm sick of L.A. It just makes sense to me, it's Nashville. And I just feel like it's now or-- - Or never. Yeah. - I'm not getting any younger. I just feel like I'm just wasting away here. - Well, I am really happy you're gonna pursue your dreams. That's awesome. It's just I'm gonna really miss you. That's all. - Sam, I wasn't planning on going alone. - You mean you'd take me? We're gonna go to Nashville? We? - Tell me that doesn't sound amazing! - No, it does sound amazing! - Us packing our bags. Why wait? - Bye, Patricia. Dragon lady, oh, she's gonna hate this. This is gonna be her nightmare. - You know what? Let's not awaken Mom quite yet. You know, I wanna make sure things are set. I don't wanna shoot us in the foot. - True. Dad though? What about him? - Dad? - Yeah. - I'd be fine telling him. Yeah. - No, no he'd be cool. - He'd understand, right? - Yeah, no, no, he'd be cool about it. He would be just as excited as we are. - No. Absolutely not. I can't support that. - Daddy, pretty please? - Come on, Dad. - Sweetheart, do you know how hard that business is? - I don't care. I'd rather fail trying to do this than succeed in anything else. Don't you believe in me? - Of course I believe in you, honey. It's not that it's just-- - Okay. Then great. I think it's time. I have to go. - Amber, I... - Dad, please. I'm going no matter what. And, I'm taking Sam with me. - Please. There comes a point in life where you have to realize that some paths are better suited for you than others. Like me. I always dreamed of being an astronaut but that's not possible. - Yeah. Dad can't even go on a plane without throwing up. That's a stellar example. - For the record, I'm better at that now. With medication. - Oh no. - It's like she knew! - She's so annoying. Momager from hell. - You'll always be my shining stars. - Oh. So if they like it they'll offer a deal? Oh, I know, right? No pressure. Well, I'll see you tonight, Tristan. It'll be great. Just like you said. Muah. Okay, let's try this again. It is showtime. - Showtime? I wanna see this. - Okay, okay. I'm ready, I'm your audience. Play for me. - Amber, don't do it. - I. - Don't answer it. Don't do it. Amber. - Hello? - Put it on speaker. - Sorry, what was that? - I just spoke with Joanne about the coaching session. She told me that you made a scene. - Um, it was acting. - No, Amber, there is acting and then there is acting like a diva. She told me you came in with a bit of an attitude. - Mom, will you just please listen to me? - Don't you dare raise your voice at me! I have been running around trying to make us money, trying to dig us out of this hole! And what have you been doing sitting around? Unprepared for auditions! You need to shape up and get this right! I can't stress this enough, Amber. We need this money! There's too much at stake. You know that. Do I make myself clear? - Yeah. - Good. I'm not mad, pumpkin. I'm just-- - Okay, bye. - Hmm, so. Nashville. Got a plan B? - I never do. - Nope. Hey, you know, I got your back though, right? - Always. Oh, what time is it? - It's is quarter till six. - The concert, baby. It's go time. - A concert with your boyfriend and his band. - Yup. - So, um, does your prince know about Nashville? - Um, I think, you know what? I think he'll understand. I mean, people make it work all the time, right? Long distance. We can figure it out. We have a long and yeah, we have a strong enough relationship to you know. Oh, you know what? I got so distracted. - What about your prince, he's so hot, fancy pants. It's not even my birthday, shut up. - I know, but, I just couldn't wait anymore and I just had to give it to you. So, surprise! - Can I open it? - Yes, please. - Okay, okay. - Moment, okay. - What do you think? - It's a dress. - I know you haven't worn dresses since you were like five, but just hear me out. I saw this and I just, I don't know, it just screamed you. - If I can wear Converse with this, if I were to wear a dress, it's actually not that bad. - Oh, well, you might need it some day. - Maybe. We'll see. Okay, um, Amber? So, diagnosis is, don't freak out, your battery is so dead. - What? We don't have time for this! - I know, no, don't freak out. I can call a Lyft. - Yes! - Can we do that? - Yes, please, ASAP. You're a genius. - That's gonna fix that and we'll be fine, and I'll just call 'em up-- - Yup, yup. - Let's see, it'll take them-- - How long? - Oy. 30 minutes to get here. - That's not, that won't work! - I'm sorry, there's no one here. - Wait, we have to be there by 6:30 sharp. - I know, I know, just let me think of something. - This is not my night. - Hey, it's okay. - This is not my day! - Well, it wasn't helped by Dad just not even helping us out. If he was here that would've fixed these. - Well, if he woulda just, you know, he just needs a little bit more persuasion. - I need more what? - Awkward. - Hey, Dad. - What's wrong with your car? - That battery's dead. And this is the perfect time for it to happen 'cause we're heading out to Tristan's show and running late. Wait a minute. Daddy, can we please get a ride? Maybe you can even come? - I'll give you girls a lift but I'm not gonna stay. You don't want your old man at a rock concert. - Come on, Dad. I wanna show you why I love music so much. If you just come, you'll see. Please? - Come on, Dad? - All right. All right, I'll take you. - Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad! - Amazing. - The best place. - I know, this is so amazing. Guys! - Where do we go? - This is for you guys. - Shut up. - Really? Oh, okay. - Shut up. Are you serious? - I know people, Sam. - You're kidding me. This is so cool. - Okay, but here's the thing. I'm gonna be right back. - Oh, give that to me. All right. - Hold onto that. - Oh boy. - Yes, yes, yes. Close your eyes. - It's all good. - I'll be right back. I love you. - Social butterfly. - You finally made it! - Yeah! - And, you brought your Dad. - It's a family outing. I'm so glad you guys are here. - Yeah, of course, I wouldn't miss it. - Oh! Whoa, Polly, you okay? - Totally fine. And this is for you. - Thanks. I didn't order anything. - Oh, it's from Tristan. - Woo, girl! - You guys, they sound so amazing! - Look at the crowd! It is so good, it's a great crowd. - It's a great crowd. - The guys are more-- - You're, you're pretty. I like your feet. - Maybe not such a great crowd. - Do you think that's a record label scout? - I don't think he's anyone's Dad, if that's what you mean. - Are you having fun tonight? - We love you, Epic Chance! - We love you, too. - All right, for this next song we have a very special guest appearance. Singing vocals tonight for us, someone very special to me. My girlfriend, Amber Bradshaw. - Did you know all about this? - Woo, Amber! - That's my daughter! - Guys, you just, you killed it up there. You killed it. And by killed it, I mean it sucked. - You guys already sucked before, but now you've stooped to a whole new level. - Yeah, so you're going for the girly market. Man, I hate to tell ya but that is uh, there's not any real money in that. Sorry. - All right, that's it. Team Crabs. - Okay, first of all, Team, it's on the freakin' shirts. Methodical Lobsters, okay? They're not even the same crustaceans. Secondly, you don't intimidate me. - Your band's a joke. - We are not a band. We're a movement. - Piss off. - Oh, okay, you wanna make us? - All right, let's go. - Oh, geez. I'll get Tarzan-- - Okay, okay, get out of here. - My jacket! Gosh, you're so strong. - I hate those guys. - The worst. - Hey, so uh, tonight, you guys weren't half bad. That new girl, I think that's what you been needing. Call my office next week. I think I can get you guys signed. - Uh, you serious? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah we totally will. - Dude, we killed it! - Woo! - Those lame lobsters can suck it. - Was that? - Yes! - Oh my gosh! I told you. - You told me what? - That you were going places. - No. No, no, no, no, Amber, we are going places. He just said that you were the addition that this band needed. It means that our guest singer just became our new permanent lead singer. - Really? - Yes! Isn't that great? - Yeah. Yes, so great. - But? What is it? What's on your mind? - Um, this is, this is hard for me to say. Um, Sam and I are planning to move to Nashville. - Is this a recent decision? - Very. But I know we can make it work. Tristan, you know, I just, I can't do this anymore. I feel trapped here and I thought-- - What if we move the band to Nashville? - Would the rest of the band even agree to-- - I can talk them into it. - I, I don't know. Just, you guys packing up like that? It's just, it's too crazy. - Yeah, it is crazy, but, you know what? Let's get out of here. Let's ditch this place. I've never been that fond of it anyways. We can go somewhere new where no one knows our names and we can, we can just start over. And be together. - Yes! - Aw. Save it, you two. We have fans to greet. - Uh. - Thanks, buddy. Good timing. - Gavin. - Amber, I'm home. Amber. Hey! Ams? What's up? Don't tell me you are practicingfor that dumb audition. - No. Just writing. Thinking. - What ya thinkin' about? - Everything. You know what's funny? The other day Mom asked me why I wear yellow all the time. - Stupid question. It's your favorite color. - Well yes, yes, of course it is. But then I thought about it, and I realized that there's more to it than that. I remember when I was really little, I was like seven, so you were like two, so if you don't remember it's okay. It was when Mom and Dad were still together. They took us to this amazing summer concert in the park. The music there, it was just like so inspiring. It made me realize that music could fix any problem. You know, like nothing else mattered. And I remember wearing a yellow dress that day. Ever since then the color yellow just reminds me of that moment. - I never knew that. - Well, it was a really long time ago. Before everything got so mixed up. - You can say that again. Things got cray. Hey. Things are going to be a lot better once we go to Nashville, right? - Yeah. You and me in the City of Music, following our dreams. - Ah, I'll just let you and Tristan do that. I'm gonna stick to making merch. - Sam, you've always encouragedme to go for my dreams. You've always been my number one supporter and, well, it means a lot to me but, what about your own? - My dreams? I don't know. I guess I just haven't found my dream yet. - Maybe it'll find you. - Maybe. - There's this page I was working on. Well, I don't, it's not done yet, so... - Okay. - But-- - All right, secret. - Something else we can do. - Yeah? Oh, classic. I forgot about this. - And. Oh geez, hey, are you okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah. - No, sorry, that was weird. - Yeah. Can I get you something? - Yeah, um, do you mind getting me some water? - Yeah, yes. Okay, just sit right there. Just breathe. I'll be right back, okay? Amber. Amber, Amber, Amber? Amber, look at me. Come on, Amber. Amber. Amber, look at me. Come on, look at me. Stop, stop, you're okay. Come on, Amber. Please don't do this to me, Amber. Hey. Come on, please wake up. Please don't do this to me. Please. Amber, please. I need you, come on. No. - Happy birthday, Sam. You're my favorite person ever. I hope you have an amazing birthday. Can't wait till we pack our bags and start a new life together. - I think my feelings are best expressed... I wrote a poem. Amber, nothing in this world can describe your light. Even in the darkest of darkness, you shone so bright. Your beauty is what made me see you, but your heart is what made me love you. You touched everyone you ever met and I hope that you knew that I was your Romeo and you were my... I'm sorry, I can't. - Thank you, Tristan. Amber's sister, Samantha Bradshaw, would like to say a few words. - Amber was so... - Sam? - How does that even happen? She was 23, she can't just die of a heart attack. It doesn't make any sense. - Sam, look, there are a lot of things we just don't understand. But they happen. - No. Not to Amber. - What do you want? - I'm picking up Sam. - I have her for another week. - Well, due to the unfortunate circumstances-- - Unfortunate? Patricia, our daughter, she just died. - Yeah, on your watch. - Patricia, please. Not now. - Sam needs to be with me. - We have a specific schedule agreement. And currently-- - Sam, let's go, baby. Get your stuff. - She's not here. - Where is she? You don't know where our daughter is? Who are you? - Tristan. Just lookin' for Sam. - Aren't we all. - I'm sorry, Tristan. We don't know where she is either. - I'm just really worried about her. She ran off with-- - Where are we going? - Sam? - Stop. - No. - Home. - This is home. Tristan, what are you doing here? - You ran off at the funeral. - Look, just go home. - I'm home, I told you that. - I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to homeboy over there. Bye bye, usual suspects. So long, men in black. I can't believe you're thinking about your boyfriend at a time like this. - He's not my boyfriend, wow. You've no clue what's going on right now, do you? Listen, Patricia, I'm gonna see you later. It was great, but I'm going to be staying with my actual Dad. - You know, the car is still under my name. So I could give you Amber's car, or I could sell it. - You would sell Amber's car? - And take your Daddy back to court. Your choice, pumpkin. Well then, I guess she's made her choice. - Don't worry, Sammy. I'll be all right. - Meet me back in the house in an hour. Welcome home, pumpkin. What's that behind your back? - It's a guitar. It was Amber's. - So, what? Are you gonna start playing music now, too? - Hey, um, papi quatro? - Hola, Sam. - Well you know where your room is. - Well it is nice to have her back. - Wonderful. Awesome. I wish Amber had given full effort to her acting career. - I thought she did. - She had so much talent. She was going places. - Hey, you were going places. Once. - You know, you keep that up, papi, and you're gonna be going places, too. Back to Mexico. - Back to Mexico. You can't be serio? Are you? Patricia, come on, we have an agreement. - What? You're talking and it justsounds like a taco truck order. This would be so much easier if you just spoke English. You know, we're not south of the border. - Ooh, that reminds me. I gotta get my tacos. - Save one for me. - Oh god, why am I so bad at this? - Because you're a horrible athlete. - I know. - You actually are really though. - Breakfast, pumpkin! Come on! Good morning. I made your favorite, breakfast burritos. - What's the occasion? - Nothing. Can't a mom do something nice for her daughter? - K. Um, can I get it to go, 'cause I'm kinda in a rush? - Sure. Of course. One to-go breakfast burrito. - Smells good. - Here you go, Sam. - Looks great. - Actually, Sam. I wanted to talk to you about something. I think it would be best if you lived with us for the next year. I'm gonna talk to your father about it and set it up. - I knew there was a catch with this burrito. - Did someone say burritos? - Sam, we're all hurting here. - I'm sure you are, Patricia. - I just want what's best for you. - Just like how you justwanted what was best for Amber? She never wanted any of this, okay? You never knew what was best for Amber. Definitely don't know what's best for me. - If she didn't want it, then why did she go with me on all those trips to L.A.? She wanted to pursue acting. - You didn't know Amber like I did. - Use a glass! Ugh, take a shower. - Hey. - Oh, and speak English or I'm gonna build a wall around the refrigerator. - That's okay, mi amor. Americano. I'll just climb over. - No juice for you! - Samster. - Hey. I've go something that I, I have to show you. Look at that. - These lyrics sound like Amber, all right. - They are amazing. - They're not finished. - That's where you come in. - It's just Holly. - I, I cannot write lyrics for the life of me but, you can. You could finish the song. You could write the lyrics and the band could play-- - Sam. - You could play it with them-- - Sam. - And then we don't need anyone else. - Sam! - And we could do this. - I don't know. - You don't know, but this is everything to her. This was-- - Look, I don't know how to tell you this-- - This was her dream. - But I'm not in the band anymore. - What? - I'm sorry. I just can't do it. - You can't do it, Tristan? Music is everything to you, you're insane. This is your life, Tristan. - Sorry. I can't. - And what about Amber? What about her dream? - Things are different now. - Things are different, I know. - Look, Amber and I were together and, forget it. You don't understand. - I don't understand? She was my sister. You know what? It shoulda been me. - Sam. - Sam, can I talk to you for a moment? - There's nothing to talk about, okay? - Please. I think it would help you. - You know, I think it would help me if you just, are you kidding me? You kidding me? - I'm very sorry. - No, stop, no, you're not trying to help me. Go away. Go away, husband number two. I don't even know, I mean, come on. No. - Sam? - Hey. That was husband number two. He's a shrink, so Patricia sent him after me to fix me. - Sam, how are you holding up? - I'm not. - What's that? - It, it was Amber's. So, see, um, she's got like her thoughts and lyrics and there's actually this song she's been working on, but um, I actually have this crazy idea that I can finish it for her, and um, somehow get it performed. - Yeah. - I don't know. - Yeah. - I think that's a wonderful idea, hon. - That's great. - I don't even, I don't even know where to start. I don't know how I can make that happen so um-- - My dad. My dad has a friend who's a music agent around here. I could put in a phone call. - Are you serious? - Yes, of course. You know, I always wanted to for Amber. But you know, she was only interested in leaving this town-- - It's true. - And not staying in it. - Typical her. - Steve, did you talk to her? What do you mean you weren't able to speak with her? Steve, she is a child. How, oh, excuse me, Steve, I am speaking. How hard is it to talk to a child? No, I am not coming over right now, I am having breakfast. - Mrs. Johnson? - You must be Monique's friend? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm Sam Bradshaw. - One moment. - Should I? Okay. - How can I help you? - So, um, I have this song, I'm trying to finish. It was my sister's. But, you see, the thing is, she passed away recently so she's not really here to finish it. And I feel like it's my mission to finish the song and get it performed in front of a huge crowd. - Wow. Most people just look for representation. This is the sort of thing I usually do for one of my current clients. I can't go out of my way for just anybody, it's very time consuming. - So I could be a client. - All right, sing something. - Sing? - You can use your guitar. - Oh, I can't play guitar. - Well why do you have it? - It's my, it's my sister's. I, I, it-- - Nevermind. Just sing something, acapella. - Aca what? Look, I, I'm really just here to finish my sister's song and get it-- - Let me get this straight, so, you wanna record a song, but you have zero musical talent whatsoever? Hm? - Okay, well, okay, she showed me a few chords, so just give me one second and okay, so I just got, I have a chip somewhere. Um. There's this one song she did. I think it's that. What was it? Oh, sorry. That's loud. Um, so it just, it was the C chord and then the, uh, sorry. Um, I just, it's not super tuned in, but if you get the gist, it's like and it's, well I could just, if you just, hold on-- - You know what? I think I get it. - I know, I know, I have a lot of-- - For the love of everything. We're done. Put it away, please. Please, now. - So, can I be one of your clients? - Come on, man. You can't just throw us under the bus. Chase and Logan tried to sing your lyrics, but they hella sucked. It has to be you singing with me 'cause you're the lead singer of Epic Chance, dude. You're Mr. Rockstar! What about that record label scout? You were supposed to call him back. No doubt those maniacal lobsters already called them. - Look, I'm sorry, Gav, it's, I just can't, man. Without Amber, what's the point? She was the one that got the scout interested in the first place. - Hope you're happy. - Honestly, Sam, I'm just telling you the reality of the business. Now, if you wanna go find a producer, record your song, go ahead, no one's stopping you. But it's gonna cost you. - Well how much? - If you wanna do it right, thousands. 5,000's a good starting point. Look, kid, I really admire the fact that you're trying to keep your sister's memory alive. I get it. Finish your sister's song, it's very heartfelt. The reality is you can't do it alone. - I'll get it. Just stay over there. Steve, come in. - You can't keep using me like this, Patricia. - We had an agreement. Get in. - Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Are you insane? - Sam, be civil. - Civil? Who else sends theirex-husband, psycho shrink wizard after their daughter? - I believe the word you're looking for is counseling. - Same difference. Congratulations, Patricia. You have really outdone yourself. Mom of the year award goes to you. Congrats. - Look what you've done! It is all your fault! Samantha Jane, please be polite. - What would you know about being polite, Patricia? - It's Mom. And what's that suitcase for? - What do you think? Patricia. - Sam, I just wanna talk to you. - Fine. Let's talk. - Sam, talk to me about your sister. Tell me how you feel about Amber. - Are you serious? Just because you married my mom for like five seconds doesn't mean you have any clue what's going on in our lives. - Hey, it was for a whole year and you know it! - Samantha, you're not the only one who's grieving. - Are you for real? You guys are crazy and sometimes I just feel like screaming my head off. - Why don't you tell me about your life at home with your family? - My family? This isn't a family. Okay, my mother, she's a raging alcoholic. She's been married four times. And the only reason the last guy married her was to get a green card, which is insane. This is not a home to me. - You believe your mother has a drinking problem? - Oh, she has no problem drinking. - It seems to me you have a lotof anger toward your mother. - Isn't that why you left? Yeah, well, it has been so great catching up with you, a real treat. You guys just really put the fun in dysfunctional. Have a nice life. - Samantha. Samantha Jane, you-- - Patricia, wait. Patricia, wait. Why don't you stop chasing after her? Let her come to you. She'll come around. Trust me, it's the only way. - I hate that you're right. - Sammy! - Surprise. So, that's that whole mess. Just-- - Yeah. - I am done with her. - That's a pretty crazy stunt. Even for her. - Right? I know. - I'm happy to have you back. - Me, too. - But, next time you think you could send me a text, let me know-- - I know, sorry. [knockin on door - Uh oh. - Please, please, please, no. It's gonna be the wicked witch. It's gonna be, no, Dad-- - Stay here. It's for you. - I want to apologize for the other day. Things-- - Yeah, no, I, I know it's... - I had a chance to think about things. I think we can finish her song. You finish the lyrics, I'll compose the music, the band performs it at the showcase. This is our chance-- - To fulfill Amber's-- - Dream. Yes, exactly. - Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. - What? No, no, no, no, no, hold on. This is your idea, you can't-- - I can't write lyrics. I can't do that, I'm not Amber. I'm not-- - Okay. - I'm sorry. - You still paint, right? - Yes, I still paint. - Okay, well art is art. Singing, writing, painting, it's all the same thing. What I mean is lyrics, they're just another form of poetry. Who better to finish Amber's poetry than you? Come on. - For Amber. - Yes! - Oh, wait. - What? - You talked to the guys about this, right? - We? Since when was Amber's sister in the band? - Amber's sister. I'm Sam. Nice to meet you, okay. - Dude, we're all writers here. We should get our stuff out there first. - Right? You guys, this showcase is our chance to get seen, since somebody blew it with that one record scout. - Tristan. - Okay, guys, this is more important than that. This is Amber's song we're talking about. Amber. - We are a rock band. We don't sing chick lyrics. - Babe? What exactly is that supposed to mean? - Uh... - You're on your own, Gav. - I mean, you understand, right? - No, no I don't, okay, because I am all about hashtag feminism. This is not okay. - It's swear off guys completely? - Stop, stop. Okay, it's a good thing you're cute. - Oh, yuck. - Dude, is this a joke? - This is not a joke, this, you guys, this is Amber's dream. This is about the dream that she never got to finish. - Come on, man. - I guess we kinda had a chick in the band at one point, so fine. - Yeah! - Why not? We'll give the lyrics a shot. - All right, but they better be as good as - You set the bar really high with that one. - Thanks. - We will never ever sing that song, Logan. - Okay, so the song, who's gonna sing it, Tristan? You? - I mean, I can. But I feel like the song, it's gonna need a female vocalist. - Next? - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Okay, okay, yeah. I, I think we got it. - Awesome. Thank you, thank you. - Was that the beginning of the song? - Great. You sing often? - My whole life. - Yeah, I liked her. - Dude, shut up. - Wow, wow. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Next! - Where do you guys want us to stand, is here good? Am I in the light? Sorry, I'm just so nervous. It's my first time auditioning for a group of homeless people. What was the band name again? I can't remember the freakin'-- - No Chance? Fat Chance? - Epic Chance, you moron. - What are you guys doing here? And do you ever change your clothes? - I don't know, Discount Captain America. I'm sorry you can't buy your leather jackets at Gucci like I can! No, we were next door rehearsing for the big show and we thought we'd drop by and see how you guys are doing. - We thought we'd give yousome actual talent in the room. You know, good looking talent. Unlike you troglodytes. - I mean, it really says something about the quality of your band that that uh new girl dropped out so soon. Man, what was her name? She was good. She was actually really good. She was hot though. - Oh, yeah. - Are you kidding me? - Nah, I'm not kidding. Sorry, oh, no. Is it you? I get my blondes mixed up. I kinda forget, but, doesn't matter 'cause she dropped out. - Get out! - Hey, whoa! - Oh, you wanna hit me? Go ahead, see how that goes. - Relax man, let it go. They're not worth it. - Got rehearsal, boys. Oh, before I go, I wanted to give you my resume, just kidding. It's pictures we drew like five minutes ago, let's go. Put 'em up, ha ha. Lobsters out! - I've said it before and I'll say it again, I hate those guys. - What is their deal? - They've always been like that, ever since high school. - Since we crushed 'em in the battle of the bands. - It looks like we didn't find our singer today. Just try again tomorrow. - Sam, your voice. - What? - Sam, get up here and sing something for me. - Sing? - Yes, yes, yes, sing. - Sing, what, like my? - Yeah. - Are you kidding? - No, no. You trust me? All right, don't answer that, just-- - Well, wait-- - Just, okay, sing anything. - Anything? - Anything. - Okay. Don't look at me. I'm singing something. Something. I'm singing. - Samster! How did I not know you could sing like that? - Dude, you got pipes, Sam. - I didn't know I could sing like that either. I've never tried, I didn't, I couldn't, I never knew-- - All right. Crazy idea. Crazy idea. You sing Amber's song. - Me? - Yes! - No. - It's not like we found anyone better today. - See? - No, I can't. - Yes, you can. - I can't do that. - Yes, you can. - No, I will go up on stage and I will freeze. - No, no you won't. - I can't do that. No, I can't, okay, okay, I did the school play once. I was Asparagus number one, I threw up everywhere. All over the vegetables. - Ew, um. - I can't. - Okay, okay, that's not gonna happen. Again, do it for Amber. - For Amber. For Amber, for Amber. I'm doing it for Amber. Fine! - That's a yes! - Why did you help him? No. I'm not, it's not, I'm gonna throw up. I need a bag. Oh, oh. Sam, me. Amber. Tristan. It's hard to come back here. I really miss her. Best friend. Love her a lot. - I loved her smile. And her funny little laugh. I loved the way she made me feel. She made me wanna be a better person. - Are you sure I should be the one to sing Amber's song? I, I don't know what I'm doing and I just feel like if I mess up and I let her down, then I don't think I can live with myself. - Sam, no one else could possibly sing her song. - That's not entirely true, but-- - No one could sing it like you can. She would want it this way. And you know that's true. Come here, come here. It's okay. - Ah. Hola, mi amor. Here is your mail. - Oh, thank you. Junk, bill, bill, junk junk. Bill, bill, bill. What? - Yeah, Bob. - Uh, hello. Hello, this is Epic Chance's new band manager, Margaret Fairweather. - I didn't know Epic Chance had a manager. - Yes, they just hired me and unfortunately, I booked them on a show that conflicts with your showcase. - What? Are you serious? - Yes. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, you try finding a replacement in the next 24 hours. - Dear Sam, I have a notebook just like this one. But this is not that notebook. This one is for you. I love you so much, sis. Dear Sam, I'm sorry. If you're reading this letter, that means that I am not with you anymore. You would've discovered that I have kept something from you for a long time. I know we always tell each other everything, but this, I wanted to tell you. There were so many times when I almost did, but I just couldn't get myself to say it. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I never meant to hurt you. - Hey, hey! Excuse me. - What really happened to my sister? - I'm sorry, Dr. Shawls. She just barged in and-- - Sam, what are you doing here? - I found these in her room. You prescribed them. What are these for? - Let's take a quick bathroom break. Come back in 10 minutes, okay? I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to talk about that. - Even after they're gone? I'm her family. Can you make an exception? If it helps, today's my birthday. - I'm sorry, Samantha. - You don't understand. I have to know this. She was my sister, she was means everything to me and it's like nothing even matters anymore because she's gone. I don't understand why and I need to know because it's killing me, you have to tell me and she left me this note and I don't even understand what it means! I have to know. Please. I can't do this anymore. - That medication was used to treat her anxiety. - Anxiety? - Amber lived in extremely high stress conditions. - Of course. Patricia. - No, it wasn't your mom. - Then what? - She was diagnosed with aortic stenosis, many years ago. That's how she died, Sam. - Aortic stenosis? I don't-- - Sam, I'm not a cardiologist. I do know however, one of the most common side effects is an irregular heartbeat, which can cause a stroke and sudden death. - Who else knew about it? Patricia. My own mother knew and she didn't even tell me. - She's not the only one. - No. Amber was, she told me everything. She confided in me. No, I can't believe that. Peter! - Yes? - What the hell is this? I told you to pick up a blue cake. - I did. - What color is this? - Blue. - This is not blue, Peter, this is purple. Samantha hates purple! - No, I don't. - Happy birthday, Samantha. - , Sam. - We need to talk about Amber. - No. It's your birthday party, let's not-- - She died of a heart condition? Why would you keep that a secret from me? - Sam, you don't know the whole situation. - You knew about this the whole time and you didn't even bother to tell me for years. - Watch it. - Can we put the knife down, please? - Amber wanted to keep it a secret because she didn't want anyone treating her differently, especially you. - You knew this whole time that she was gonna have a short life and you yet you kept it from her and you controlled her. It's always gotta be about you, isn't it? Let's just make it about Patricia! Every time it's about you! - This is exactly how you behave when you've been spending too much time at your father's. He always gets you to turn against me! - This is not about my dad! This is about Amber! - All right, just calm down! - Watch it, Peter! Sam! I am not done with you. Samantha! Sam, Samantha! Samantha Jane Bradshaw, you get back up here right now. - You don't understand you did nothing for her. You ruined her life and you, she didn't want any of this! - That is not true, she loved acting! Amber loved acting! - Do you wanna look at this? Do you wanna look at this? This was her dream! This was her dream, and you know what else? - Get that out of my face! - You know what else? It's your fault. It's your fault that she's not with me. - I can't do this anymore, Amber. I need you. - I know there isn't enough time for me to really pursue my dream, but there's enough time for you. Find your dream. And when you do, fight for it. No matter what, never give up. I know you have it in you. I've seen it. - Honey, are you okay? - It was Amber's. - Why did you rip it up? - All she wanted to do was write music and sing. How could I have done this to her? - You had good intentions. - They say the path to hell is paved with good intentions. I turned into her. I ran away from her after I got pregnant. No wonder Sam hates me. It's just come full circle. It's like it's happening all over again. I've already lost Amber, and now I'm gonna lose Sam. - Patricia, you know, we have a saying in Mexico. Means family is everything. Definitely worth fighting for. - Hey! - We are gonna rock the house tonight! - Yes we are! Hey, have you guys seen Sam? - Yeah, she's in the green room. - Take this? - Yeah. - Dude, let's go! - Samster. - Hey. - You nervous? - Is it that obvious? Amber was always so ready to get up there on that stage. She was fearless. And me, I just think about getting up in front of all those people and I can't, it freaks me out. How do you do it? - Do what? - How do you go up there and how do you control your nerves and... - It's easy. You just picture the audience in their underwear. Yeah, it's frankly not a pretty sight. - No. - I don't know. When I'm up there, I just get so lost in the music, you know? - Yeah. - Hey, Sam? - Yeah? What? - I, I look forward to playing with you on stage. - Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Me, too. - Look, I don't know how to say this, but-- - Gavin, can you knock? - Knocking's a waste of time. - What's up, Gav? - Did you ask what time soundcheck is? We don't want to sound like a bunch of zombie sea lions on stage. - See ya. Yo, Bob. Just seeing what time our soundcheck is. - Seriously? Don't you ever talk to your manager? - What manager? - The one who called an canceled you. I had to schedule the MethodicalLobsters in your spot. - Dude, what's up? - We're not playing. - What? - Someone called the owner pretending to be our manager and said that we couldn't play tonight. - Are you serious? Who would do that? - I think, I know who did it. - Don't tell me-- - I, I think I can fix this. - Dude, this was supposed to be our night, but you had to go get whipped over your girlfriend's sister and screw it up. - You don't know what you're talking about. - You're gonna throw away everything we worked for. And for what? A stupid girl? - Sam, wait! - This was our shot. Now it's ruined. - Come on man, that was our chance. - Look guys, I uh, where's Sam? - Here we go again. - Look, I'm just worried about her, okay? - So what's the plan now? - All righty boys, let's pack it up. It's all good, man. - Robert! I'm Patricia Blair, I'm Epic Chance's actual manager. I'm here to make sure that they perform tonight! - Are you serious? There is no way I am going to change the lineup now. - You listen to me, little man! You're going to make sure-- - Get out! Before I call security! - This isn't over. - I'm gonna try calling her. - How long is it gonna take us to get out of here? - Oh, did you hear they got that new girl, Epic Chance? What's her name again? - Sam, I think. - Sam, yeah, that's right. They're so freakin' sad. Ah, man, they're just so pathetic. It's like, just know when to kinda throw in the towel. - They were just a bunch of nobodies anyway. - Yes, exactly! See, you know what, they think it's all about the fun, it's not about the fun. Art is pain, right? You think Van Gogh would've been able to paint the Sistine Chapel or whatever, if he didn't cut his face off first? - Exactly. - You see, exactly! Yes! Dude, you gotta do something. You idiot! I thought I told you to put the brakes on. - I thought that was your job! - It was never my job, you butt smear! You're my cronies for a reason, run! - Oh no. - What? What did you guys do? You hit my car! Do you know how much this was? - You guys suck! - Who pissed off Robert this time? - He's gonna kill us. - No he won't. - Yes I will! - Sorry! - Hey, get back here! Your band's back on tonight. - Thank you. - Go tell 'em about soundcheck. - Sam! - Patricia. - Sam! - Leave me alone, please. - Sam, wait. Sam, I only wanted what was best for you. I never meant to hurt you or lie to you. - You canceled my performance, why? - Sam, I was trying to protect you. - Protect me, what does that even mean? What are you talking about? - Do you remember that times years ago when Amber and I went to a recording studio? - I don't know, yeah, what? Amber was supposed to record an EP and things didn't work out. - Yeah, things didn't work out. We got scammed. - What? - I had finally saved up enough money for Amber to record her demo, and I met this so-called music producer. He demanded that we pay all the money upfront. It was thousands of dollars. The day to record finally came. He wasn't there, no one was there. He had taken all of our money and skipped town. I still remember the crushed look on Amber's face. So from that moment on I just saw the music industry as a dangerous one, and I had to protect her from anymore heartache. - So that's why you hated the whole music thing? I kinda just thought you were doing that out of spite. - Out of spite? I wanted her to follow her dreams. She's not the only one who had a dream, you know? - You? - All I ever wanted was to have a nice, happy family, with a cute, little house and a white picket fence. When I found out about Amber's illness, it broke me. You have no idea, Sam, what it's like to lose a child, to know you will outlive your own daughter. - Why were you so insistent in pushing Amber into an acting career? - I wanted her to have surgery for her condition. Hospital bills alone were outrageous. I would've had to win the lottery to ever be able to afford it and so, I thought our chances of Amber making it in the movies were better than us winning the lottery. I know it's stupid, it's crazy. I just, I was trying so hard. - You were trying to save Amber. Yeah. - Start unpacking, boys, you're back on. - What, really? - Yeah, in one hour. - That's great! - That's more like it. - Guys, it's like an epic chance. - More like a fender bender. - I'll take it! - All right, let's go! - Thank you! - Guys, no, no, no, no, stop, stop. Don't you do that. - All I ever wanted was for you to be happy, okay? And, I'm not gonna get in your way anymore. - You fixed it. - Sam! We're back on! - What? What did you do? - Oh, Sam, please. You think some show runner's gonna stop me? Pumpkin, I eat those for breakfast. - I should've known. But um, you're coming right, tonight? - I wouldn't miss it for anything. - Hey, wow. You look, is that a new dress? - It's close. It is actually um, it's a gift. From someone really, really special. Hey, what was that thing you were gonna tell me before the whole Gavin-- - Oh. - Thing happened? - Right. - What was that? - I think, uh, this is hard for me to say. Spending all this time with you, making music, it's been great. - Yeah. - When I'm around you, I kinda feel something. I don't know, am I crossing the line? - No. I mean, I wouldn't really know what like crossing the line is, so I... - I loved Amber, I really did. I miss her, so much. I don't even know what I'm trying to say. I, I just, I guess I wanna thank you for helping me through it. - You have no idea. You helped me! I don't know what I would do without you. - I guess what I'm trying to say, Sam, I really value your friendship. I really care about you. Do you think Amber would want me to be happy? In the future? - Give it time. When I lost Amber, I just felt like a huge chunk of my heart went missing and um, you're helping me get it back. And I know for a fact, Tristan, Amber would want us both to be happy. Someday. Maybe. - Right, agreed. - Someday. - Someday. - You know what is, okay, so funny? - Hm? - This whole time Amber's been like encouraging me to find my own dream and do that whole thing and, it just occurred to me, Amber's dream, it's mine. We have the same dream. Tristan, it's like twice the dream. - Let's do this one for Amber. - For Amber. - James Mullen, everybody. And now to the stage I am proud to introduce-- - Get away from me, you creep! - Our own Epic Chance, featuring Samantha Bradshaw. - Hi. I'm Sam, Sam and I'm gonna dedicate this song to my sister, my best friend, and my life, Amber. - Oh, you were so amazing! I'm so proud of you! - Oh, thank you. Can't breathe. - Oh, sorry, sorry. It was great though! - Ooh, thank you! - Nice work, you did so good. - Great, thanks, David. I appreciate it, man, really. - Spam, that was killer. - Thanks. - You're like the whole reason our band's back together. - I am just like seriously so proud of you guys. - Thank you. I'm proud of you, too. Agh, thank you. You two have fun. - Bye. - Not too much. Monique! - You guys were amazing. - Okay, yup. - Amber would be so proud of you guys. - You were meant to do this. - Thank you so much, Mom. - You called me Mom. - What I meant to say, we're good. Okay? We're good. Just so, agh. Now we're good. Now we're good. - Okay. Will I see you at home? - Yes. I'll see you. Bye. - What's so funny? - I don't know. I mean, we did it. We did it. We finished Amber's song. - Feels good, doesn't it? - Yeah. Too good. I just feel like, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, it's gonna be a dream and-- - No, no, no-- - That song. It was so powerful. Who wrote it? - Um, that was my, my sister, Amber. She wrote it. - Well she definitely knows how to write an inspirational song. And you, Sam, what a performance. - Really, thank you, I. - I was impressed with you guys. Truly. But the problem is, I'm from out of town. But, if you're ever in the area, just call me. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah, yeah, I remember. - All right. Gavin you don't get any. - Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Tennessee's pretty far. - Yeah. We're gonna be fine. Follow her dream. Follow yours. I love you. - Tennessee! - Sam, let's go! - Come on you guys! What are you waiting for? Get in the car. - Come on, load up. - All right, all right. - Peace out, rock stars! Up on the stage - All right, Methodical Lobsters. It's our song, it's the end credits song. Buckle up, we're about to make some freakin' art. Rockin' red lobsters - We love you, lobsters. Save the world. Save mother earth. - Mom! Mom, get out of the freakin' basement. Okay? No, this is my zone. All right, do you smell the Doritos and the Mountain Dew Game Fuel? My area, okay? I marked this, marked this territory. Not with that, that's gross. Okay? Mountain Dew Game Fuel, Doritos, posters on the wall. This is clearly where I'm supposed to be, okay? Yes, I will go to Grandma's thing later.
