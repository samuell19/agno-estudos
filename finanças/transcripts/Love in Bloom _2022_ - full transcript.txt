Amelia, you've done it again. I'm sure you would have created something just as beautiful. The wedding is in 10 hours and the bride is impossible to please. I didn't like my chances. Besides, you're the golden girl. Just ask 'Coast to Country' magazine. Oh, these reviews aren't about me, they're about the company. Hey, everyone knows you're the heart and soul of this place. Well, if I had my own store, I would have foxgloves in the window and- And a little brass bell on the door and a 'bunch of the day' on special so everyone can afford a little luxury. Well, that's what my mum's store did. Don't you have a special dinner to get to? I do, it's my five-year anniversary. I bet Peter's gonna propose tonight. - You think? - I just know it. August Ivy doesn't know what he's talking about. You haven't lost your touch. If anything you have more... touch. Don't let it get to you. Besides, soon you'll be in Australia with nothing to worry about but planning my wedding flowers. I can't wait for your wedding, Bon. I'm so excited to see this country town that you've fallen so in love with. I'm surprised Peter can make it. He always seems so busy. He's just always working. And you must be so busy. I thought I'd have a lot more responsibility as your maid of honour. Jake and I are actually on a wellness retreat. Getting some respite before all the wedding madness. So close to the wedding? Wait, is... is everything organised? Ah... sort of. - Bonnie... - There's not that much to do. You know, just the rings and the cake, and I got the table settings and a couple of dress fittings. - Bonnie! - Don't worry about us. We're manifesting. Envision the perfect wedding, and that's what you'll get. Yeah, need to manifest a positive review. Promise you won't read it again tonight. Promise me, Amelia. I promise. City Flowers star florist Amelia Hart has impressive technical skill but is let down by another wedding playing it safe with her trademark white flowers. Perhaps Amelia is a one-trick pony. He called me a horse, Peter. A horse. Well, these reviews aren't about you, they're about the whole company. It says my name in italics. I've been negatively italicised. There is a waiting list a mile long full of people who want their wedding flowers designed by Amelia Hart. Who cares if you're using a tried and tested formula. It just shows that your business savvy. You'll be much happier once you get that business district contract. I know. Now can we leave August Ivy for the evening and celebrate our anniversary? You're right. I'm so sorry. This whole thing has made me such a crazy person and I haven't even started thinking about Bonnie's wedding, and we're leaving soon. Um... I need to talk to you about something. Oh? We're planners, you and me... and there's one milestone I've been planning for a very long time. Really? I haven't caught you totally by surprise I hope? I mean, I did wonder if tonight was the night. Amelia, you know me so well. I do. I'm so relieved. This surgery is going to be fascinating. It's the first of its kind. I can't say no if I want to become chief of medicine within five years. I'm so glad you understand. As soon as they asked, I knew there was no way I could pass up an opportunity like this for a wedding in... where did you say it was? Australia? Primrose River. Maybe I should leave early? You know, to take like an early vacation. That's a great idea. You should go early and spend quality time with your little sister before the wedding. Text Dr Simmons. Patient has perihepatic free fluid... Dr Simmons. When the seeds of love are sown, it's you that blossoms. So, Grayson, what's the prognosis on your biggest patient? - Infection's healing well. - Oh good. Oh, look at those eyes. He has the heart of a champion. So what do we owe this morning's visit? Can't a good neighbour just pop in to say, hello? OK, a little birdie told me that the city zoo has offered you another veterinary position? Is there anything you don't know? Just whether we're going to lose you to the big smoke or not. I don't think so. Could be a good move for you. You might even meet someone special. You know I don't mix well with city people. Oh, Grayson! City people are just country people who got lost. Hi, how was the flight? The flight was fine, but my bags are gone and I brought you a special box that belonged to Mum. That's gone, too. They've disappeared between Tulip Mountain and Primrose River apparently. They'll turn up. They always do. Now I need to tell you something... Promise not to be disappointed. - Promise... - Bonnie? This line is terrible I can barely hear you. Amelia? Bonnie, is that spa music? Are you still at the retreat? You were due back days ago? Oh, there's just been a tiny little storm. More of a strong breeze, really. Bonnie... Flights are grounded and we're kinda stuck. Bonnie. We'll be back in no time, OK? But I do need you to pick up the wedding bands from town Primrose River is tiny. Everything is just a walk away. And, you know, at least you don't have to carry around any heavy luggage. Please? The jeweller is lovely but she's known to get a little confused. I'm worried something might happen to them and I would just feel so much better if they were with you. Text me the name of the store. Thank you. Hello? I am in Australia. This... is... awesome. Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. I am here to pick up some wedding bands. - Oh congratulations! - Oh, no, no, I'm not the bride. I'm just to help the ring bearer. I'll just grab the order book. - Great. - Name? Bonnie and Jake. Oh, a lovely couple. But, I'm sorry, those rings have just been collected. That's not possible. Does it say who picked them up? I just served him. There he is. - I know what's happening. - What? He stole them. He's a scam artist. This happens all the time in Chicago. - No? - Yes. I thought that was the vet. Excuse me? - Excuse me, sir. - Hi. - Excuse me. - Are you alright? - I don't mean to bother you. - Oh, do you need directions? No. No. I don't mean to make this awkward... Well, that's a relief. Ah... No, no. I... I'm sorry, is this a stick-up? No, I would never. We sometimes do things that we're not proud of. Like this one time I was supposed to water my mother's orchid when she went out of town, but I really wanted to go to Kimberly Watson's sleepover pool party, and I thought, you know, I'd give the orchid two days worth of water. What's the harm? Turns out orchids don't really like that much water. And by the time my mother got home, the thing died a tragic death. And you know what? Kimberly Watson's pool party, it wasn't even that good. She didn't even have a pool. All she had was a hose. So, my point to this really long-winded story is that I understand your position is what I'm trying to say. And what position is that exactly? About the scam you got going. The con. What are you talking about? Taking the rings that don't belong to you. So, I'm just gonna look the other way as you gently return them in my hand. The wedding bands I picked up from the Cornflower? Yes. My sister's wedding bands. Oh, I see. And you're here to make sure they stay safe between now and the big day. - Bingo. - Well, I can't argue with that. Though I thought that was the job of the best man? And I don't want him to look bad. We wouldn't want that. Well, you know what? You've convinced me. I'll hand 'em over. Thank you. Look, I know agriculture is a really difficult business and I'm going to buy produce from the farmers market from now on. I'm sure that's appreciated. I hope you find whatever it is that you're looking for. Two wedding bands for a start. Ha! You're funny. You are funny. He's really good-looking... for a thief. This is gonna be interesting. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Wow. Hello again. I don't think I've seen you before. Oh, that's a hummingbird Golden Bell. Part of the chrysanthemum family. That particular breed is unique to the gardens. They're beautiful. Is this your garden? I like to think I'm in charge, but the flowers have other ideas. Flowers will do that. - Tom Poppy. - Amelia Hart. Ah, the maid of honour! And the famous florist. We weren't expecting you for another few days. I'm early. I hope that's OK. I'm sure you've arrived just in time. - Come inside. - Thank you. I knew Jake's parents owned an inn, but Bonnie failed to mention how magical this place is. Is that the famous Amelia Hart I can hear? How did she... It's just easier to assume Mrs Poppy knows everything. Tea? Oh, that would be so lovely. Thank you. Hi. It's so wonderful you've come earlier. Welcome to Hummingbird Cafe. Wow. Come have a seat, Piper? Amelia. Amelia, Piper. - Hi. - How are you? How can everyone be so calm? Oh, Piper. Take some air and some deep breaths. Don't mind Piper, she's just very nervous about all the wedding preparations. Luckily she managed to have a moment with Bonnie on the phone. And then her phone cut out. Yeah, I spoke to Bonnie. Her line was terrible. - Milk and sugar? - Yes. Luckily Piper managed to find out where the wedding list was. I can't take care of the cafe and do all of that on my own. You won't be on your own. Look, help has arrived. Bonnie told us all about those celebrity weddings. So we'll just let Amelia guide us. OK? Oh, I... I only do flowers, Mrs Poppy. But you were in 'Coast to Country' magazine. I know because Bonnie told us. Oh, that's so lovely but that was about the company that wasn't about me. But Bonnie said you are the 'it' flower girl of Chicago, so you're perfect to help with the wedding. Besides, you won't be on your own. Between our chores at the inn we can all help and Grayson will too. Grayson Tanner, the best man. Well, I'll try my best. I can help. Whatever you need. Biscuits, macaroons, cake. Especially cake. Mainly cake. Just cake. Piper works in our little cafe. And she's making Bonnie and Jake's wedding cake too. Bonnie taught me everything I know. Bonnie's the best. Well, what's first on the list? Wedding rings. Got it... Check. See, everything's under control. And, then... cake tasting. Gosh, this place is just... it's so beautiful. And the detail. I mean, look. Ah... is there a bathroom I can go freshen up in? Oh, certainly, love. Let's show you to the cottage On the very likelihood that your luggage has gone on an adventure... I've taken the liberty of putting some of Bonnie's clothes on the bed for you. I think you're about the same size. Yeah, just about I think. Oh, as for the cake tasting, as I recall, Jake doesn't like coconut. Oh, not a bit. And Bonnie doesn't like chocolate so I'll mention to Grayson, no coconut and no chocolate. Your early arrival is serendipitous my darling. - Thank you. - Welcome to Daisy Cottage. I've always thought there was something very romantic about the humble daisy. You know, I always thought daisies were weeds. Weeds are just flowers who refuse to grow in rows. You're quite the romantic, Mr Poppy. He's a gardener, he has to be. Now, you make yourself at home, love. Let us know if you want anything. - Thank you. - See you a bit later. Come on. Please leave a message after the tone. Hi Peter, I'm here in one piece. I am staying at the most gorgeous inn and the owners have these amazing flowers that... ones that I've never heard of before. Such a mess. Come on, Bonnie. Don't you have anything less... Bohemian. Hi, you must be Grayson Tanner. Amelia, lovely to meet you. Are those the wedding bands? Yeah. Flew in from Chicago, right? Ah... I'm sorry, but have we met before? I'm not sure. Wait, were you at Kimberly Watson's pool party? OK. You know, she didn't even have a pool. I obviously made a fool of myself. Yes, you have. I apologise. It was a really crazy long flight. I appreciate the apology. - I'll consider it. - You have to accept an apology. No, I don't. - Well, I think you should. - No. Well, then I take my apology back. You can't. You already gave it to me. - Piper! - Good afternoon, kiddo. Right, let's get this over and done with. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hummingbird Cafe, where we will create the cake of your dream. Piper, you don't have to give us the whole sales pitch. OK. These score sheets will help you find the perfect cake. You rank each cake based on flavour, texture, and so on. Have a look and I'll bring back some delicious samples. Is all this really necessary? I mean, we're not trying to create something overly complicated. Well, I think it's a wonderful idea. What a great way for couples to choose a cake. Yes, but we're not a couple choosing a cake. We are representing a couple choosing the cake. Why don't we just decide on one now and be done with it? What did you have in mind? What about... that one? No. What's wrong with that one? It's a children's birthday cake in the shape of a tractor. I hope your taste buds are ready for an adventure! A tractor. Mmm... mmm... Is this coconut? Coconut cakes were huge in the early 2000s. I bet they're making a comeback. Cake flavours do not come in and out of trend. I've provided more flowers to more weddings and I can count. Trust me, there is a trend for everything. Do you want to know what's on trend for cakes right now? - No, I do not. - Earl Grey tea. I don't believe you. Hey Piper, made any tea flavoured cakes recently? Earl Grey, jasmine or matcha? This is a perfect chocolate cake. Right. Piper, we've made a decision. - Chocolate. - Wonderful. Always a crowd-pleaser. But we can't have chocolate. - You just said you liked it. I did. I do, but Bonnie doesn't like chocolate. - Who doesn't like chocolate? - Bonnie. I really think Jake would like the chocolate. Well, I think Bonnie would really like the coconut. Jake doesn't like coconut. Well, Bonnie doesn't like chocolate and you're happy to go with that. Fine. Piper, we'll go with a coconut cake with chocolate frosting. Ah... So, Bonnie has to scrape off the frosting and all Jake gets is frosting? That makes no sense. Could I make a suggestion? I'm supposed to give real couples time to chat between themselves, but I think in this situation maybe that would be a mistake. Perhaps you should get the opinion of two people who are less invested than yourselves? Like the bride and groom. I can't plan a wedding with her, Jake. It's only been 20 minutes, Grayson. Come on, mate, give her a chance. I did give her a chance. I gave her a chance to be friendly and she accused me of being a thief. Then I gave her a chance to like cake and she picks one made of tea. Tea, Jake. Grayson and I have different attitudes when it comes to making decisions. How do you mean? He likes to make impulsive, bad decisions while I like to make thoughtful, good decisions. I'm sorry, that came out wrong. What I mean to say is that I like to consider things while he makes snap judgments. She's going to turn this wedding into some city girl, Instagram Pinterest wedding. What's a Pinterest wedding? He's going to turn this wedding into a 10-year-old's birthday party. I'm sure he won't... with you there to help. Well, that's why I made you my best man. There's nobody else I'd trust with my wedding. I am so sorry for all of this, Amelia. There you are with all that stress, and here I am. No, it's OK, Bon. I mean, I've had to deal with high maintenance brides and grooms, I think I can handle a rogue best man. I've got your back, Jake. OK, the wedding will be great. Ready for round two? Let's do it. I think I need new cue cards. OK. So we scored the 4 out of 5 for the citrus and a 1 out of 5 for the coffee cake. No, to coffee cake. Hey, would you look at that? We scored a 5 out of 5 for the rose buttercream. Congratulations, Mr Tanner. I do believe we have made a decision. Thank goodness. Great! I should be getting back. Oh, did you want to meet tomorrow considering that we're on a tight schedule? Sure. Let's meet here at say 10:00am? Perfect. And if things don't get any crazier, we might be able to just pull this off. Stranger things have happened. I'll see you tomorrow. OK. I love to walk here in the mornings to clear my mind. I feel like I'm walking into an enchanted garden with all these inspiring flowers glistening against the lake. It's like a Monet painting. Oh, Amelia. It's so wonderful having an artist-in-residence again. - Oh, I am not an artist. - Nonsense. Your arrangements are creations, aren't they? Your bouquets represent the most complex human emotion of all - love. So that makes you an artist, doesn't it? Well, our clients are more focused on show-stopping arrangements that appear in magazines than love. The grim realities of the hustle. Something like that. But I'm up for a major contract supplying flowers for the corporate offices in the financial district. Won't you miss working with people? Bonnie told me all about your mother's flower shop. It sounded like you were following in her footsteps. My mum... she was... she was something special. How so? When you bought flowers from her store, you were taking part of something special. She would... she would give a piece of her heart to you and in return, you would do the same. I just don't deal with clients that much, so I don't know how to do that. Sounds like you just need to have the right environment to bloom. Wait, do I smell coffee? You Americans and your coffee. Mmm. Liquid gold. So where's the surgeon? Um... what? Mrs Poppy mentioned that your boyfriend was some big city surgeon and that he'd be joining you. He wanted to come, but he was just so busy. He's about to become... Come this way. ..the chief of medicine. Well, just as well you're spoken for or Mrs Poppy would have tried to fix you up. You'd be engaged before the end of the week and we'd be planning two weddings! He's right. I'm known as somewhat of a matchmaker around Primrose River. - I set up Bonnie and Jake. - Oh. So that just leaves you, Grayson. Thanks, but no thanks. I've only got room in my heart for one lady and stopping her from eating your roses keeps me busy enough. Oh, he's talking about a mini goat. Oh. Now, we just have six days until the wedding. And we still don't have a bride and groom in sight. Right. Right. OK. Well, we have wedding bands. Check. Cake tasting, check. And now we just have to choose entertainment. Select table settings, flowers, my domain, and the last thing on the list is a final dress fitting, but I'm sure we'll have the bride and groom for that. It's a plan. Yes. I thought they already had a band. They did but they fell through so we have to choose from one of their favourite performers. So whoever has the most votes wins. Easy peasy. What could go wrong? Bravo! I loved it! - Come on up. - Oh no, no. - Oh no. - Si senor. I'll give it a whirl. Bravissimi! Well played! Oh, that was so beautiful! Thank you. Thank you for coming. You know, I thought this would be a lot harder but this is a really easy decision. Agreed. I mean, it's obvious, isn't it? Clear as the sky on a spring day. So we had the Flamenco Fanfare, the Bluebottle Bill and his banjo, and, the undeniably talented, Champagne Trio. So we're all in agreement? Bluebottle Bill's a legend. Don't you want everybody up and dancing? Yeah, but Bonnie and Jake need something romantic to dance to. Their first dance can't be the Bullfrog Hayride. Why not? It's a great song. Really I'm kidding. Look, OK, Flamenco Fanfare were great but they're not exactly Bonnie and Jake either. Yeah, sorry Mrs Poppy. Their loss. I just think the classical musical selection is a bit... Beautiful, elegant, amazing? Stuffy. This isn't the foyer of a fancy hotel. Ah! Sorry, am I late? Is the place for the wedding audition? This is Summer Kingsley. She babysits for the Brown family. She also came third in the swimming tournament last year didn't you? Second actually. Summer is our resident songbird. She sings in the garden every Christmas. Um... I'm generally very supportive of young people but, you know, it's my sister's wedding and do you think she's a little... Inexperienced? Summer, have you played for a live audience before? I sing at the festival at Christmas. There's usually like... 15 people there. See, 15 people. Bona fide professional! When you're ready, darling. Congratulations Summer. What are you doing on Saturday? Wait, I got the gig? You sure did. Oh. Thank you so much. Congratulations, honey. Congratulations, honey. Right, what's on the docket today, then? Greatest thing in the whole wide world... flowers. Flowers are next, Grayson. You know, I can probably take it from here if you have someplace else you need to be? I'm committed to my best man duties. I promise, I won't interrupt. I'll hold you to that. Oh, Amelia. Wonderful. How did your auditions go yesterday? Did you make your decision? Mrs Poppy found us a wonderful musician. She's a magical woman my wife. I've known you two since I was a boy and I swear you fall more in love every day. Have you met her? Who wouldn't? Are these heat-resistant roses? Certainly are. How did you get them so voluptuous? I have a foolproof aphid deterrent - marigolds. Aphids don't like marigolds? Aphids don't like ladybirds and ladybirds love marigolds. The beetles make their way to their rose neighbours... like a round-the-clock security system, keeping those pesky aphids away. That's how the roses get so full. They help each other grow. Camellias. They are the most perfect flower. Don't you think so, Grayson? Oh... Yeah, I guess so. Amelia, my garden holds the National Camellia Reference Collection. Would you like to help me plant some of these seedlings into it? Yes! Yes, I would. You sleep... and we'll see you soon. Whenever you're ready. Take your time. Mr Poppy, did you did you do all this yourself? I've had some assistance over the years. Ha! He's being incredibly humble. Mr Poppy's been working on these gardens for as long as I can remember. It has been a labour of love. What's... What's that over there? Oh, that. I've had some ideas. A barn store perhaps where people could purchase flowers and produce from the gardens. Looks like it could be something special. - With a little bit of paint. - And a new roof. A true garden is never finished. As the wise, Audrey Hepburn once said, "To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow." So what are you gonna do with it now? I don't know. Perhaps tomorrow will tell me. - What is so funny? - Nothing. Just a side of you I didn't expect. What? A flower nerd? Is that even a thing? I think it is. I like it. You're like a completely different person. Well, I obviously made a great first impression on you. That's not what I meant. Just mean you see more relaxed. Less worried about colour palettes. Camellias are my favourite flower. They're special to me. Special how? They were my mum's favourite flower. She passed away from cancer when we were both young. I'm sorry. She loved them so much. She used to say that she named her daughter after them. Amelia is short for Camellia. Is that a little cliche to be a florist named after a flower? Not at all. I'm a vet named after a horse. - No? - Yeah. My father's favourite horse was called Grayson. He was a stunning stallion. People came from miles around just to see him. - He was famous. - Is that true? No, I just didn't want to make you feel bad. These are the blooms Mr Poppy is cultivating for the wedding. I like the yellow ones. You promised to be quiet. I'll stand here in silence being quietly supportive. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just not... Flowers aren't just about being pretty, they each have a discernible voice when they say something. I know it sounds crazy, but flowers have whole language. For instance, it's Mother's Day, what kind of flowers do you get your mum? I don't know... carnations? The... sunflowery ones, the big daisies. - Gerberas. - Yeah. OK, well, why not red roses? Because they're romantic. Well, why? What is it about the red rose that says, "I think about you all the time." "I care about you." "I desire you." "You alone above all the others." I don't know. Because I just don't know what... this bouquet says... is all. Are you OK? Most likely. It's just a minor procedure. Just one problem. My assistant is stuck on a mountain with his fiancée. Can I help? Come on, let's go. Hey there little guy. You're safe now. You're safe. Hey, there's some formula, can you just mix some in a bottle? Oh yeah, sure. I know you're hungry, she's getting you some. - Oh. - Thank you. Hi. - Hey. - Hi little guy. Here you go. Here you go. Whenever you're ready. Come on, you can do it. Look. Look. Look, look, look. Aren't you beautiful? So cute. Is he gonna be OK? He will. Probably just got separated from his mama. Does that happen a lot? Sometimes. Nature can be tough. But so is he. He looks healthy. There's no reason he shouldn't be released once he's big enough to take care of himself. He's cosy now. Not as cosy as his mother's pouch, but still pretty good. I can see why you spend so much time here. What makes you say that? First of all, why would you ever want to leave? And secondly, I saw your toothbrush in the bathroom. Guilty. Yeah, this job isn't always 9 to 5. I was actually offered head vet position at the City Zoo on the promise of better hours. Would you leave Primrose River? Oh, not a chance. - Must be tiring. - Sometimes. But you make time for the things you care about. So I guess I'll see you tomorrow to figure out the seating plan? It's a date. No, it's not. It is when I will see you next. Thanks again for helping me, Amelia. Happy to help. - Good night. - Bye. Amelia, we were starting to get worried. We're just going down to the bottom of the garden to watch the fireflies, would you like to join us? Oh, that sounds so lovely, but I think I'm going to turn in. OK, that's fine. - OK. Good night. - Sleep well. Thank you. You too. Amelia, good morning. Good morning. I'm just off to work on some flower designs. I should have something soon. When you're ready. Is there something else I can help you with? Now that you ask, actually, I was hoping you might be able to help an old man impress a certain someone? I would love to. How can I help? It's my wedding anniversary. I think this place is just crying out for some laughter again, don't you think? Some children running through over there, a couple taking a moment to themselves just over there. These Gardens will be busy with guests again one day, Mrs P. I have a good feeling about it. I know the world would love this place. I just don't know how to get the word out. - Mmm. - Thank you. Mm-mm! What do you call these delicate little treats? Honey blossoms. I made them with honey from your beehives. Mr Poppy makes joy for the eyes. Piper you make joy for the taste buds. Delilah, you make everyone feel at home. I wish I could just package this place up and sell it in little brown paper bags to everyone in Chicago. Oh, that's so sweet. You know, that dress really suits you. Thank you. I really hope Bonnie doesn't mind. Well, I'm sure he doesn't. Now, tell me about Peter. Who? My boyfriend. He's a surgeon... I just tried calling him this morning, but I must have missed him. He's been really busy. No, I mean tell me about him. What is it you love about this man? How did you know Mr Poppy was the one for you, Mrs P? Because when I was with him, he made me feel truly seen. He loves all of me just the way I am. And I can be a lot! When the seeds of love are sown into your heart... It's you who blossoms. Your mother was certainly right about that. Morning. Hope you're ready to work out which one of your uncles will get along best with Jake's football buddies! - I'm sorry? - It's 10 o'clock. We're supposed to help Mrs Poppy with the seating plan. Oh, it's ten o'clock already. Um... Wow. You're really talented. No, I don't feel talented. - Out with it. - Out with what? I may not speak florist, but I do speak miserable. It's how I diagnosed a koala with a salt deficiency. You're upset. What's wrong? I got a bad review. Oh, no, not you? You've done over 65 weddings! So what's one bad review? I'm sure you've got hundreds of brilliant reviews to make up for it. One bad review from August Ivy from Coast to Country magazine is like a hundred bad reviews from everyone else. Well, what did she say? 'He' said that he thinks I lost my touch... and I think he might be right. - Right, I know we need to do. - What? We're getting you out of here. Well, what about the seating arrangement? Mrs Poppy is more than capable of doing the seating plan. - Ah... - You're right. She'll have everyone playing musical chairs all night. OK. Extended family, high school friends, footy buddies, college friends... miscellaneous. Let's go. Huh. Oh, they've sorted it the darlings. Good. Ooh. I don't see how this is helping my problem? Sometimes, the best way to find an answer is to stop looking so hard for it. - Thanks Grayson. - OK. Bye. Come on buddy. This is a kangaroo paw. See, looks just like a kangaroo's foot. Native to Australia. It's so calm. This is where Primrose River meets the sea. Starts as a trickle in the mountains and works its way over the hills and valleys to pour out into the ocean. Gives me that sense of... Coming home. Yeah, something like that. You've worked on lots of weddings, what do you think the recipe is for couples who make it? I guess they seem just so easy with each other. And they make each other laugh, and it's effortless like they don't even know they're doing it. Peter's a lucky guy. He is. We are very lucky. Thanks. Oh. Amelia! A piece of your luggage arrived, but it's not your clothes I'm afraid. No, it's a brown box. Oh, thank you. You know I've always preferred daisies over roses don't you? I know. - Hello, Peter speaking. - Peter, hi! - Amelia, do you mind holding? - No, no. I'll hold. - Amelia? - Hi Peter. - Is something wrong? - No. No, nothing's wrong. You know, I learned something today about rose bushes. Yeah? - So if you plant marigolds... - Yeah. ..next to the rose bushes, the ladybugs on the marigolds... - Right. - Will eat the bugs that try to attack the rose bushes. Huh. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, do you think that we're growing together? Amelia, you sound half asleep. No, I'm not half asleep. I have a surgery. Can we talk later? OK, yeah, when are you free? Tomorrow is good. OK, yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. OK. Great. Talk then. Bye. Marigolds. Rose bushes. It's you that blossoms. Mrs McKenzie's eyesight has gotten much worse she can barely read the specials sign. Order more gardenias. Kate just had her heart broken. Sunflowers for warm, fuzzy heart mend. Is still limping from his wrestling match with crownfish. Gloria's twisted... Oh, Mum. Oh, Mum. Grayson! Grayson? Grayson, I know how she did it. Don't tell me, I haven't watched it yet. What? Whatever murder-mystery you're talking about. No. No, my mum. Look, she wrote all these observation and notes about people. So Mrs McKenzie's eyesight has gotten much worse she could barely read the specials sign. Order more gardenias. Gardenias are an incredibly fragrant flower and she was reminding herself to focus on smell and not colour and that... Here's another one. Dr Wilson uses his order to decorate his waiting room. No lilies, more bulbs. Lilies they irritate the sinuses and she wanted more cheerful blooms like tulips and daffodils. It wasn't magic, Grayson, she just... she just listened. Wow! That is a beautiful horse. Mercedes is special. I would love to spend more time here, but I gotta go, I'm too inspired. I know she's beautiful, Lauren. I have eyes. 'Cause she has a boyfriend. Award-winning doctor boyfriend who's probably going to propose. I mean, most handsome doctor award probably. I don't know. Lauren, we've spoken about this. You know what, Lauren? Good idea. Remember the first dance should be about love. And above all... passion. Remind me, why do we need to learn the first dance? Because Enrique is booked for months... we need Bonnie and Jake to learn the steps. It is a tragedy. But at least you and I have done this before. We'll have to lead this uncoordinated butterfly. I am... not an uncoordinated butterfly! My child, you have the grace of a newborn giraffe blinking in the sun and tripping over its own neck. You know it was not too long ago that Grayson stumbled into my dance class and now he moves like a panther! Slinking across the savannah! Hm? Alright, enough talk. Let's dance. What is that ringing? Oh. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Peter, hi. - Amelia, how are you? - Yeah, no I'm... Great, yeah. No, I'm just in the middle of something. OK. You sound busy. Yeah. Can I... Can I call you later? - OK. - OK. - I miss you. - I miss you too. - Talk soon. - OK. Bye. Bye. No more distractions. No more distractions. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes, sir. You OK, you seem a little tense? Just feeling the music. Very good, Grayson. Very good Grayson! Whoo! And then when it's time for the wedding, you two will be more than ready. - Oh. - We aren't... Amelia's got a boyfriend back in Chicago. So... Boyfriend. Yeah. I... He's great. We're just friends. Amigos. Yeah. Amigos. Oh Tom, your garden. Oh! Thank you, Amelia. Delilah, I've known you for 45 wonderful years. As a gardener I've been lucky enough to know the joy of when a rare flower decides to make a home in your garden. You are as rare and as wonderful as any flower. It would be my honour if you would join me in renewing our vows. Oh Tom! I would love to. Thank you so much Grayson for your help. You know... beneath that tough Australian country boy exterior, yeah, there's a bit of a romantic. I like a bit of romance every now and then. Oh, really? Yes, sometimes I even put rose petals in my bathtub just for fun. Oh. Sounds delightful. I was actually engaged once. We had the wedding all planned out. Everything was ready and... I guess you decided I wasn't right for her. Wow, Grayson. I'm so sorry. After that I just threw myself into my work, which isn't hard to do. I mean the animals are incredible. And you know what, I wouldn't change a thing because it led me to this moment and to see that incredible display of affection between Mr and Mrs Poppy. And that was really something, Amelia. I hope you remember how you made those two incredible people feel. Especially when you're thinking about that August Thistle, or whatever his name was. Yeah. August Thistle. You're a bit of a rare flower yourself, Amelia. Hi Peter. Amelia. Nice dress. Very... rustic. You don't like it? I do. It's just different that's all. How are things down under? You sounded, well, crazy the other day. Peter, there's something I need to talk to you about. I know what you're going to say. You do? I think it might be what you're trying to tell me with the ladybug story. I mean, it's strange, right? That... that we're both planners, and we've never even talked about our future. Yes, and I agree with you. - You do? - We should get married. As soon as I become chief of medicine. That's not what I meant. It's not? Peter, we haven't spoken in days and... and I just don't feel... - Feel... what? Are you excited when you see my name appear on your phone? Amelia, you're just getting swept up in old-fashioned ideas of romance. It's not like it is in the movies, people don't surprise each other with flowers. Or romantic dates or... Dancing under the stars or watching long sunsets. Exactly. Peter, if we were meant to be together, it... it shouldn't be this hard. I mean, I know it shouldn't be a fairytale either, but I do think it should come naturally. And maybe I am getting swept away but you know the nice thing about getting swept away is that it just kind of happens. If you want me to buy you some flowers and light some candles we can put a date in the diary for some romance. I think we need more than a date on a calendar for romance. I just don't think we're growing together anymore. Peter, you are the most clear minded, ambitious man that I have ever met. You're one of the most thoughtful intelligent women I've ever met. I'm sorry, I can't give you what you need. Me too. I'm sorry too. Maybe we're just better off as friends? I'd like that - maybe not right away, but one day. Paging Dr Peter McKenna. Well, duty calls. Bye, Amelia. Bye, Peter. Thinking of you. Piper, how did you know? Hi. That woman should work for the FBI. You're very quiet today, Grayson Usually you're telling me off for something. I'm busy pretending I know anything about fixing cars. I've also been busy planning your son's wedding. Any word from them? Still waiting for a flight I'm afraid. You're sure you haven't been distracted by a certain charming florist. I don't know what you're talking about. So you do not have feelings for Amelia. Nope, no feelings other than normal people feelings. Then you won't be interested to know she and her doctor boyfriend have broken up. There you go. She'll run like a dream now. When? How? Did she say anything else? I thought you had... how did you put it? Normal people feelings for Amelia or whatever that means. Mr Poppy, please. Grayson, I think it would be a very wonderful thing if you finally, truly let someone in. You know, I haven't seen him this happy in a long time. Who? You think I came down in the last rain shower? Grayson. He's not had a smile on his face since his fiancée left him at the altar. He was left at the altar? Took a long time to bounce back from something like that, but he did and now you are here and I've never seen him so happy. Amelia, what's wrong? I've never been so happy, Mr Poppy. I feel like myself if that makes any sense, but I've built my entire life in Chicago, so I can't just abandon it all. Amelia, do you see this flower? Yes. Do you know how many hours and weeks and years I've spent cultivating it to grow it in my garden to get the perfect spring yellow? It's your life's work. I did not grow this flower, it grew itself. I did not plant the seeds or crossbreed it with another plant. I just walked into my garden one day and there it was, bright as the sun and just as audacious. It just grew on its own? Love will grow wherever it finds somewhere to thrive. All you have to decide is whether to nurture it. More cake? I've become Piper's official taste tester. I can't eat any more cake. Just, please, help yourself. Sticking to your one colour palette, I see? I'm looking for the delicate nature of the dahlia, the beauty of the aster... Baby's breath is so pure, but it's... I have to take this. Busy, busy. Hello, Amelia speaking. Amelia, Tom Hooper from the Chamber of Commerce. Oh, Mr Hooper. Yes, of course I remember the President of the Business Association. I'm calling to offer you the contract. Congratulations. That's amazing news. I thought you'd be a little more excited? No. No. No. I'm very happy. I can be back in Chicago as soon as the wedding's over. Fantastic. We're excited to have you on board. Thank you. Yes, I'm very excited too. Wonderful. Well, have a safe trip and we'll see you soon. Thank you. Thank you. OK, I'll talk to you soon. Now... where were we? Grayson? So this... It really is so very lucky that you're the same size as Bonnie. Very. Well, are you gonna come out soon? Is that really necessary? Yes it is. If I have to then you... have to. Thank you. Come on. Come on. Oh, they look stunning. Amelia... Yes, Grayson? Wahey hey hey! We made it! Don't let the groom see the dress! Don't let the groom see the dress! Bonnie and Jake, you made it! Look at this! Looking sharp mate! Amelia, did we scare you? Hi darling. Oh, I'm just so glad you're here. Oh, me too. Now, get out of that dress so I can get into it. Come here. Help me out of this. You look so beautiful. Finally, Bonnie and I would like to thank everyone for making it to our rehearsal dinner, including us. Oh and a very, very, very big thank you to Amelia and Grayson. Without them none of this would have happened. They have saved our wedding and our deposit. To Mum and Dad... I'm the man I am today because of you. You took me in and you raised me as your own and I will forever be grateful. I love you guys. Oh darling. OK, that's enough of that. And the toast. Let us be grateful to the people that make us happy, they are the charming gardeners that make our souls blossom. They make our souls blossom. Cheers guys. Mm, yeah. I can't believe you almost missed your own wedding. We had things under control. Sorta. Typical Bon. You good? I'm so good. There's something different about you. You're... I don't know, like... you look really happy. No, I just I feel like I have this like new creative energy or it's this place. Mr and Mrs Poppy. I... I mean, this country town that you were talking about it's... well, I do have one very important question for you. Am I ever getting my clothes back? No. But I will let you borrow them. Oh, thank you so much. You're getting married! - I missed you. - Oh my god. Good morning. - I'm getting married today. - OK, calm. What do you reckon Mercedes? Do I pass muster or... Do not put horse hair on that coat! What are you both doing here? I told you, I'd take care of everything here today. Amelia delivered our button-holes. He didn't want to put them on without you. Feeling good. Terrified, but really good. I can see that. Bonnie, she just makes, my gosh, every day amazing, you know? She's my sunrise, my sunset she's my next breath and I don't know if that's corny or romantic, but that's what I'm sticking to. Jake, that's about as romantic as it gets. - Yeah? - Jake it's time. Oh, OK. Goodness. You should tell her, you know. - Tell who, what? - Amelia. I don't... Grayson, I've known you a long time. Something magical is happening for you. Something you didn't expect or ask for. Let it. How do I know she feels the same way about me? Gentlemen. Amelia has really outdone herself. Just look at the beautiful colour she chose. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Grayson Tanner and I have the privilege of being Jake's best man, his best vet, and his best friend, and I won't hold you from your celebrations, but I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to toast to the bride and groom. I work with animals, which means I don't have to talk very much so I'll ask for your forgiveness in advance. I have not always understood what love is. In fact, sometimes I think I still don't. And I'm beginning to wonder if that's because love is everywhere. It is our friends. Our family. Our passions, our work, our values. And sometimes some of us are lucky enough to meet someone when their very soul seems to embody all of these things. Love is very much like the flowers in Mr Poppy's gardens. They start from a seed without anyone asking them to, and, with the right amount of care, bloom into something beautiful, that wasn't there before. I'm beginning to wonder if what's so difficult to understanding love is in marrying two very different ideas - something so profoundly rare, complex and wonderful is asking something so overwhelmingly simple of us. To just let it in. To Bonnie and Jake. Two people who make love look easy. May the sun shine down on, may you have just enough rain to grow and may your roots grow stronger with every season. To Bonnie and Jake. To Bonnie and Jake. Oh, who did the flowers? Oh, Amelia's in Bloom. Oh. We did good. You did good. This is all you Amelia. Oh, I don't know about that. We make a pretty amazing team. - Amelia... - Grayson. - You go. - No, no. Ladies first. I insist. Amelia... this last week has been amazing. And I know it sounds crazy, but... you mean a lot to me. You mean a lot to me, too. But what... How do you see this working? My whole life is in Chicago. Perhaps I could... Leave all your animals and go live in a concrete jungle? Come on, you would hate that, and I wouldn't let you do that. Besides, I have a contract that I have to... Of course. I wouldn't expect you to. Um... so what is it? This exciting new project back in Chicago? It's a corporate contract for applying flowers to businesses. Like lobbies and waiting rooms and veterinary clinics. Doesn't sound very creative. It's secure, and it's reliable. And safe. I understand. But right now, you don't sound like the same woman who just spent all afternoon creating a whole field of daisies, or used a secret flower language to do all of this. I didn't do this. Everyone else did. Love did. I'm not my mother. So when do you leave? I have to be back Monday, so... - Grayson... - Amelia. I didn't know your mother. OK, but I do know you. And you are more extraordinary than you give yourself credit for. Don't look at me like that, Lauren. Of course I'll come back and visit. I'm taking a new job, not moving to the Moon. Now, you have to stay here and take care of Jake. Besides, the zoo doesn't exactly have a goat exhibit. Grayse? What on Earth is this? You decide to take a job five hours away and you tell me in a letter. I mean, nice handwriting, by the way, but who writes letters these days anyway, I saw you yesterday. I didn't want to cause any drama the day after your wedding. Oh, so you thought that leaving a note and disappearing without a word was the least dramatic option? You don't understand, Jake, I need a fresh start. This is about Amelia, isn't it? - You love her? - No. You do, it's written all over your face. Grayson. She's your soul mate. - I can't alright? - Grayson. Gray... - Beautiful last day. - Yeah. - Do you have to leave tomorrow? - I do. I'm gonna miss this place. Well, then, let's make sure we enjoy today. What on Earth? Can you believe it? It's been like this since 8am. And it's all because of you. Look... Amelia in Bloom is trending everywhere on social media. - What? - Yeah. Oh that's my sister! I knew people would see you. Excuse me. - Amelia... - Mr Poppy. ..you must speak, flower, for you've enchanted my garden with life! We're a sensation! I don't know what to say. Amelia, this is all happening because of you. Look around. You always did have that special thing. You were always just... a little bit magic. Just like Mum. You could have a store in Primrose like your mother's. Just like that? Yeah, Mum, he was adamant. I don't know. Jake have you seen Grayson? Ah, he's gone to the city. Whatever for? He decided to take that job at City Zoo. Said he needed a fresh start. No. No, he can't. Why? Because... because... Yes? Because I love him! Jake, how long have we got before Grayson gets to the train? Ah... he just left, so it will take him at least 15 minutes in that old truck of his You'd never make it. You'd have to cut across the paddock, and you'd still need a stallion to beat him there. Mercedes! I don't have a Mercedes. Huh? Oh, Mercedes. Let's go get him. Come on, Mercedes. Ya! Come on. Whoa boy. Grayson. Amelia, what on Earth? Mr Poppy, offered me the chance to open up my own store and I said, yes, and the one person that I wanted to share it with wasn't with me. My mum used to say when the seeds of love are sown into your heart, it's you who blossoms. And I always thought that that was some silly thing that gardeners said. Amelia... Just let me get this out or I'm never going to be able to say this again. I'm a better person for coming to Primrose River and I've never been happier in my entire life and I want to be able to share that with you. And I want to ride bikes with you, and I want to eat cake with you, and I want to laugh with you, and I want to be with you and grow old with you. What? Amelia... I've never... I've never felt this way about anyone and yet here you are accusing me of being a thief, digging up flower beds, turning flowers into poetry, chasing me down on a horse. Amelia... you are infuriating. You are the most incredible, brave, wonderful woman I've ever met... and I am so in love with you.
