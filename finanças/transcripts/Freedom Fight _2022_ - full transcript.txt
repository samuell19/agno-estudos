If I talk to you in office, everyone will come to know. Then there'll be trolls and memes. Better to avoid it. I know. - Shall we order coffee? - Hmm. Two coffee. Geethu... Listen to this with a cool head. - What happened, Girish? - Nothing serious. Though we met only recently... I know everything about you. Your ex-lover... I mean, your marriage with him... ...I know that you had to call it off. Who in office doesn't know that? Anita. Oh... Hmm. Geethu, what I... ..wanted to say was... Hmm? Sir, coffee? Yeah, keep it. - Geethu... - Hmm. I... No, you were saying something. Oh yeah, what I was trying to say was... Yeah. Come on. Tell me, Girish. Geethu... I love you. I wish to marry you. If I immediately accept his proposal... - I love you. - What? - Really? - Yes. I need to call him everyday... Chat with him often... And should be careful not to let anyone in office know. Should roam around with him on his bike... Go for movies... Amidst all these if Anita comes to know about it... See how gutsy she is? Got the next guy immediately after breakup. And she will inform my ex-lover Renjith. If he comes to know... Super, damn you. Super! It's amazing! You'll rot in hell, bitch! Step aside, you! To hell with her. He will spread rumours. Didn't I tell you that she has another lover? She didn't call off the marriage for nothing. See what happened now. What happened? They'll come to know about it at home. Then my mom will... Are you out to bring shame on us? My elder brother... I've had enough supporting one of your drama. Shut up and get lost! Between all these problems, he will ask me one day... You still text your ex, right? He will doubt me, We will argue... There will be fights... I'll message whoever I like. Get lost if you can't stand it. I'll cry... We'll patch up if we are lucky. Then if I marry him leaving my home and my parents.. First night. Visits. Honeymoon. And maternity leave. Baby. Naming ceremony. Birthday. Finally, resign the job to look after the baby and be a... Housewife. Now if I say no to him... I don't love you. I'll wait till you say you love me. He'll message me everyday. Share love status. He will stalk me. Geethu... Geethu... Then the same Anita will endorse him. See my dear, he loves you knowing that you had dumped another guy. Even if you don't say you love him, Why don't you send him a message? Just a message. My goodness! If I send him a message as she said... She loves me. Yeah! She is in love with me. Now if I don't message him... Geethu, can't you treat me even as a friend? If he gets tired of it, he will... She notices me. Sends me messages too. - But... - Dude, girls are like that. Even God doesn't know what they have in their minds. Correct! Then there will be more calls... More messages... He will tell himself... She loves me. No doubt. When he realises that none of his tricks worked... If I've become a nuisance, sorry. You stay happy. I won't trouble you anymore. I was patient and forgiving all these days because... I expected you to love me back someday. But... Whoever is going to marry you is lucky. There won't be another woman in my life. Bye. Miss you. Then he will cry... Drink.. He will cry again. And drink again. Then he will wail. Don't love any female in this world. They'll slit your throat with their smiles and tears. Get lost! Geethu... - Geethu... - Hmm? Do you love me or not? I'm asking, do you love me or not? Do I love him? Girish... Yeah? I need to think. That is... Honestly, it's not that I don't like Girish. But I'm in a big mess now. I have only myself to blame. - Dad... - Yes. - Mom... - What? Ready. I'm in love with a guy for the last two years. He will come here tomorrow to talk to you. Even if you don't find him to be OK, I will marry only him. OK. Bye. He came the next day. Thanks. The very next day, his parents came too. Dad okayed him. Mom was okay too. Brother was more than okay. - Brother had a reason for it. - What is it? She is Pooja. The one I'm going to marry. - Hello. - Hi. She is your guy Renjth's cousin. Really? He never mentioned. We are distant cousins. And I came here only recently. - Where were... - I did my studies in America. A policeman murdered a guy in America, right? I was in America when that happened. Oh dear, I can't tell you how it was. They vandalised and burned shops. A guy from Thrissur had a shop there. It was a hangout place for me and my friends. You know they had the most amazing food! That guy had a daughter. She was so cute, you know. Our Jebit's daughter, right? She looked like her. Jebit still doesn't talk to me for not attending his wedding. But his wife and I are good friends. We have plans to start a small business together. After going round and round, I got stuck there itself. I was standing there wondering where to go. What should I do? - It was my first time in America, right? - Yeah, of course. I somehow managed to reach my room. You haven't seen our room, right? How awesome it was, my goodness! One day, while relaxing in the room, a sudden sound! I'll get it. There is a concept that the brother shouldn't marry before his younger sister. But no problem if both marry at the same time, right? - Not my plan, it was my brother's. - Oh. So my marriage was fixed along with my brother's. - Everything was set, but... - Hey. I've been calling since morning. I don't know why, it wasn't going through. I won't be late, mom. I left office. Yeah, I left. I dropped in at Lali's place. I won't be late, mom. I'll be there soon. I'll call you back. Things are bad at home, right? Don't ask. So bad. I can't even buy a dress I like. Look at this. It's mom's choice. Told me that I must wear it. Now they are looking for marriage proposals for me. No point blaming them alone. It was you who started it, right? You're right. But just think about it, sis. How can I get along with Renjith? Didn't you know all this while romancing him? Believe me, he was so amazing during that time. - But he changed after engagement. - Hmm? I must call his mom everyday. I've no problem calling her if there is some reason. But why should I call her everyday just like that? That too, video calls. Why? Sis... What will my mom think? That she doesn't love them? Right? See. I told you. I love them only if I call them. Can't I love without calling? - You called off the marriage for this? - I'm not done. The list has just begun. He made me change my relationship status on Facebook. I told him. I don't use that Facebook account at all. People who check your profile don't know that. What will they think? That you're not keen on this marriage. Right? How is that? As if it wasn't enough, he posted our photo captioned "You're my world, my life!" Who did? He. He posted from my account. Super! Leave all this. He said I must call him 'Etta' with respect. Granted he is one year elder to me... But I've been calling him 'hey', 'dude', and by name all this while. And now, suddenly, I have to call him 'Etta'? Call him 'Etta'? Why? Sis... If others hear her calling me 'hey', 'dude', etc., what respect will I get? That's why I... Asshole! Not just these. There are many more issues. I called off the marriage when I realised things would get out of hand. He was locking me up. I would have been trapped. I didn't cheat him as they say. You're sad about it, right? Sad... I am. I act this way just to show that I'm fine. You know, I don't even sit alone these days. Either I'll listen to music, or talk to someone. I miss him a lot... Anyway, didn't you learn so much from it? Now don't do anything in haste. You're impulsive by nature. Yeah, come on. You too blame me. It's okay, dear. Everything will be fine. I came to ask you about something else. Okay, what? Aren't you a big professor and all? Tell me what it is. - The thing is... - Yes. I want to speak English fluently. I speak English fluently. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you, everyone. I'm very glad to receive this award. I'm very happy because this is the result of my hard work. I'm 'Oxford' while speaking to myself. But I don't know why. I'm stuck when I speak in office. That's enough for Anita to ridicule me. Anita speaks English very well. That's why she is so arrogant. Ticket? - Brother, one ticket for rest house. - Ten rupees. I must speak English well at least once in front of her. Also... If I get involved in things, and get some recognition... I can forget and move on. So, I've strongly decided that from today... I'll not rest until I learn to speak English. Dammit. Wait till they get out. Lali has given me some simple tricks for that. Trick number one: Listen to English songs and watch English movies. Trick number two: Talk to people in English without hesitation. No problem even if you make mistakes. Trick number three: Follow both the tricks properly. OK.

Did you delete that photo of you and Renjith from Facebook? I don't know. You go check. Do you think marriage is child's play? I'm worried if those who're coming tomorrow will see that photo. What? Who is coming tomorrow? Son of dad's colleague. They are going to come. No, mom. This won't work out. You only wanted it. Did we insist? We can't let you be like this. Mom, who told you to do this? Weren't you the one who came to us with a proposal? - Still, don't you have to ask me? - Stop. Don't raise your voice. Don't yell senselessly. Neighbours might hear us. The mother has no sense, now daughter too! Yeah, I married you because I didn't have any sense. Yeah, you don't need to worry about anything because you have me. Yeah, I know. What do you expect me to do? To come and marry you right now? Dear, wait till a decision is taken in her case. I can't do anything when she is here like this. You alone can't... Tell me. Oh, you and your America! Why do you go to America whenever I say something? Hope you will warm the cockles of my heart tomorrow. [Wrong Malayalam translation of the message] Cockles. Huh? - Water. - I don't want it, mom. Take it. You'll get some disease from not drinking water. I get water in office, mom. - Eeks. What's this? - What's wrong? You got only this faded dress to wear everyday? It's not faded. This is its colour. Colour, my foot! People will think we can't even buy a good dress for this girl. - Give me a break, mom! - Hey Where's the new dress I bought for you? I don't know. Search for it yourself. Yeah, I'll find it. So messy here! Never keep things in order. Here, see this. You'll go wearing this today, okay? Else, don't leave the house. Whose marriage is it? You're all decked up... I didn't mean to make fun of you. Hey. Your outfit is so boring. So be it. You know? A good friend is like a mirror. Mirror never lies. Oh. I heard something. Aren't you done after making one guy resign? You going for the next? I'll become a murderer if I see you again, That's why I'm quitting. And not because I'm sad after you broke up with me. Okay? Girish is a good guy. Don't give him trouble. He is my best friend. Not just that, I like him a lot. Okay? Leave him alone. You'll get another guy to fool around with. Don't try to cheat him. Hey... Are you okay? I don't know what Anita told you. She said things about you to me. I don't take any of that seriously. All those things are of the past. They don't matter to me, okay? I'm in love with you. And I'm waiting for your reply. Bye. Hmm. Don't you go there anymore, son? No, I don't. Okay. Didn't I tell you? Let them talk to each other. Okay... Hey, no. Not at all. Never. Sure, we'll let you know. Sure. Bye. Who was it? The groom's parents? Yeah. They liked her and said we'll do the engagement soon. Exactly as I thought. I was sure that this will work out. Hmm. Let us see. I'm not okay with it. She will become okay as time passes. I'm not you to become okay like that, mom. Arguing with me? Not arguing. You keep saying that you were a fool to marry dad. - Stop it, you. - Get lost, you. Why are you in a hurry to marry me off? Go ahead and marry if you want. Talk softly. What will the neighbours think of us? Dad, isn't this our house? Are they paying our bills? I don't give a f... damn about what they think. Stop it, you. You made us dance to your tunes. What happened then? I agree, mom. I backed off when I realised that it was a mistake. But family and others would laugh if they hear about it. You think it's child's play? Is my life important to you or the others? - We must answer people for these. - Why? Are you making me marry for my happiness or to please others? Want me also to crib all my life like you do? Mom, can you say that your marriage happened with your full consent? Can you? I don't want to end up like that, That's all. After yesterday's happenings, I expect some change at home for a few days. Parents won't start a fight for a few days. They won't bring up the topic of my marriage again. Then they won't interfere in my affairs too much. Just for a few days. Then they'll be back to old ways. It'll be fine. It's the same in all families. I'm going to resolve another issue today. Good luck! Girish... I have... I have taken a decision for ourselves. Ever since you proposed to me... I was worried about what would others say... ...if I get committed to you... ...as I had gone through a breakup recently. I've kept aside a lot of decisions in my life... ...in the thought of what would others say. But I'm no longer going to live according to others' opinion. From now on, I'll take care of only my likes and dislikes. So Girish, I'm in love with you. I never thought you'll do something like this. Geethu, how did I present this to you? Wasn't it at a private space with just the two of us? Hmm. What did you do now? In full view of everyone, a cheap drama. Won't they gossip about it? Geethu, don't you have any common sense? Even the MD saw it. Shit. I don't know what they'll think about you and me. Forget about you, what they must've thought about me. Geethu... Keep our matters between us. There's no need to tell others about it. You get it? Did you get it, dammit? Get lost, asshole. What? I said, to hell with you, asshole. Switch the damn thing off! Shh! Don't make a sound! Keep it down gently. Now, you get on first. - Give the torch. - Hold on... Go, see. Anyone around? No. Slowly, slowly! Careful. Hold it. Why do you insist that we do it where I work? This is your idea, right? Doing it here will make them understand. This is the main place. Yea, I am going to lose my job in this main place. I've heard that locks can be picked with hairpins. With what? Pass me the hammer. Sister, softly! Sister, can we do it without making noise? No, I guess. Who's that? Sister, somebody is coming. Let's run. Run away after all this? Let them come. I'm asking who is that! What if I hit them with this... What are you doing? Trying to steal, what else! You go, call the police. No, we are not here to steal. I work in this shop as a sales girl. I forgot my bag inside. Came to get that. Oh, OK. Come. Let's go. Don't be an idiot. You forget yourself at the sight of women? Break into a closed shop, in the guise of getting a bag. They are here to steal. Isn't it obvious! Look here... We are not here to steal. We have come to build a toilet. What is the difference between a light tea and watery milk? Nothing much. Same thing in different terms. Did you go? You too? I came to sit down for a bit. I'll feel like peeing again if I have tea. Didn't you go just now? No, some devil has been in there for a long time now. Women should learn to hold their pee. After leaving home in the morning, I don't pee until I am back home. Don't you lie, girl... I have seen you going. That's for changing pad. If you are used to holding, you only need to worry about periods. Have you read about 'cup' in the women's magazine? Yeah, I saw that. But it needs to be inserted. I can't do that. What is your problem? When someone marries you, won't you allow him to do that? Can you not discuss these things while eating? Nice time you chose to defecate! As if, I should care for her convenience. Prasad, the matter I told you... The powder forms patches on your face when you sweat. Please take care of how you look, always have a smiling face. Always have a pleasant face. You should look pleasing to the customer. That's not what I wanted to talk about. It's about the toilet... Aren't you managing that at the hotel? We don't have the space to make a toilet here. Viji told me the building plan will pass only with provision for a toilet. Won't there be the space for a toilet? Who's Viji, the one from the tailoring shop? Yeah, the one in Bimbino market. Not just in our shop, this is a problem in all the shops. Oh, so you have formed a union already! No, no union. We just had a chat at the hotel. I allowed the evening tea at Arya Bhavan, to use the toilet. And you formed a gossip group? No Prasad, a tea there costs Rs. 5. It's not just once a day one needs to pee, right? Where is so much urine coming from? You drink only one bottle of water. Tea is free here, You drink that tea and then want to run to the hotel to pee. If I let you drink tea several times and then pee... When will you work? The building plan has the provision for toilet. That's now our store room. Is that allowed? I allow... Will you allow? Bring an empty bottle from tomorrow. Mmm... 'Caught a glimpse? No. I didn't.' 'Heard something? No, I didn't.' 'Caught a glimpse? No. I didn't.' 'Heard something? No, I didn't.' Took a long time today! Shall I sing "I hate you"? Come along. No time for singing competitions! Viji, I have an idea. Tell me, "Ms. Pleasant Face" Let us get everyone together. What do you mean? I mean, let us call all the women working in SM street shops. Let's see if we can get a toilet built. We go to the backside of this building. Is there a toilet? Nothing, just a wall. Men, women, we all go there. I can't go, without a cover. Is that a big deal? It's not a big deal for you, Viji, it's us they pass lewd comments on. Who is commenting? I told you, Viji has not heard any of it. They are staring and eve teasing all the time. Why didn't you tell me? My problem is, you can't wash there. Yeah, I get itching because of it. I also have that problem. This is a workers' issue. We work for 10-11 hours. Can we not approach a trade union? They will intervene as this is a labour issue. All of us together? A couple of us should go, talk first. But, why didn't they tease me? First, all of you take membership in our union. Then we can see about the toilets. That's not the right thing. The basic needs of the labourers should be met first. Membership can wait. Politically speaking, not sure if... ...it's an employer vs worker issue. We have a toilet here. Can you not adjust with that? Are you suggesting we should walk 3 km from our shops to come here and pee? It is much easier to go to Hotel Arya Bhavan. What is the problem in going to Arya Bhavan? Who's this? He has come from the Calicut University. To learn and write about the union. 'Unorganised labourers and apolitical organisations... ...from a trade union perspective' That's my topic. See, after working for 10-11 hours... ...the only break they get is half an hour for lunch. There are no toilet breaks or toilets. To use the toilet, we go to Arya Bhavan, buy tea... ...and stand in the queue for toilet. They don't even let you sit, let alone pee. We have to wait at Arya Bhavan till the toilet gets free. To use it, we have to buy tea and snacks from there. Each costs Rs. 5. Rs. 10 daily, it's Rs. 300 additional expense a month! Another 15 rupees daily for bus fare. All that we get is 1500 rupees a month. For that too, they keep a performance condition. It's not just once a day one has to pee. Building licenses are given if the floor plan has toilet, right? If we go into all those details, we won't get anywhere. Do you think the union office is as per plans? Even they have a point. Let us give it a try. It's not possible to hold the pee through all the working time. I can. We will have a discussion. Will inform. Right? One minute... You don't come to work from tomorrow. I won't do it again, I promise. Not about doing again, you should not have done it. I badly wanted to pee, Prasad. You all went to the union office to pee? I don't understand what you say. You promised me that you won't go to the union people. Oh that, I just went with the others. I don't need to know all that. I don't have the means to build a toilet now. Suresh, bring her bag here. Don't worry... You will get another job, in some shop with toilet. Eh? I can recommend you at Vijayalakshmi. Should I? Should I, eh? 'I'm a poor singer, my love...' If I tell my family, they will kill me. I want to kill that Saji. He tells me, what if I'm jobless... I can comfortably use the toilet at home. He should be killed... I don't want to kill anybody. I just need my job back. Whose baby is that? Mine. Why should I hold someone else's baby? You said you can't insert the cup... Yes, I can't. Can you keep quiet? Let me just finish this. Viji... I have an idea. Can we talk to the union people once more? All this happened because we went to them. She has a point. Why don't we remind them about the laws? I told you, we should have called everybody. Oh, agreed! Can you shut up now? There's no sugar in this. We should not see this as an employer-worker issue. This is a problem faced by the female workers. Why, men don't pee? Male workers are not bound by decency issues. For example, what do men do when they have to pee? They pee! Yes, they go to a secluded area and do it there. In limited conditions also... ...they can manage it well. Their approach is commendable. No such complaints from them, so far. They just need a wall. Some of them can go to the mosques. We cannot do that. We need some privacy. Firing workers without prior notice is a breach of labour rights. But in this case, it was done on disciplinary grounds. When we spoke to the shop owners... ...they claimed that you were all failing in your duty. How did we fail in our duty? Abu said clearly that he fired me because we came and spoke to you. Look... What? Do you wash after peeing? What? Do you wash after peeing? Why should I wash? Need not wash? We just shake it when done, that's all. It will be clean then. If you touch there, shouldn't you wash? Why? There is no need. Then, don't touch me if you don't wash after urinating. Why, suddenly? It's like that. You wash hands after washing your ass, right? This is also the same. No no. My God! Don't you wash your hands after a dump? Don't you even wash your ass? I thought such people were only in the proverb. Come on, I do all that. If you need to wash hands after every fart, you should have a pond in your palm. There should be some disease that makes people wash hands often. Then you will learn. You try to get a job somewhere, instead of making me wash hands. Hey! How come the baby is not with you? I ate it. I can't do without a job, Viji. We can manage, we are rich! Viji, should we not do something? We have to bear with their obscenities... ...and pee into bottles in the dressing room. In the dressing room? I got this idea when he asked me to bring a bottle. What do you do with that bottle, then? I empty it at home. And bring it the next day. Wow, that's something. I can't even do that. Our shop does not have a dressing room. Viji, tell me this. When they fired that guy from the medical shop, union intervened. Right? Don't we have a union? If we all get together, it is a union. Right? It doesn't work like that. No problem, we can give it some name. Viji, does your dress have a pocket?! Kabani! I stitch the dress myself, so I can add a pocket too. I want it too! Did you see? Hmm... Are you busy now? Wanted to ask about that expulsion without reason. OK OK. Come... So you all were fired? These three. When did it happen? It's been 2 days. Which shop? We all work in SM street shops. Were you also fired? I came with them. I am a tailor. We have a collective, 'Penkoottu'. Kabani is an activist there. OK, 'Penkutti', right? Not 'Penkutti' (girl), 'Penkoottu' (sisterhood). OK. Which shop in SM street were you working in? I was in Pia textiles. She in Surya textiles. That one in Noor Bazaar. Sir, the headload workers' file. What was the reason to fire you? There is no reason at all! We were fired because we went to see the trade union people. Why did you do that? It is very difficult for us... What, working? No sir, there is no toilet. We went to the union for some solution to it. What did they say? Asked us to take memberships. We were fired for this reason. We have done nothing wrong in our work. We were told we could complain here. Who told you that? Our lawyer. You are Kabani, right? Give a written complaint here. To say this, that guy asked these many questions! I have been seeing this for long now. Most of the labour officers speak for the management. Won't there be somebody to talk about our side, too? Yeah, he is paid by the government to talk on your side. But, no use. But there are laws here. There are laws to resolve each of these issues. Please tell Kabani about it. Kabani please see. No problem, I will give a copy of it. Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishments Act (1960)... ...states it all clearly. Kerala Shops and Commercial Act (1960) ...clearly states it all. It says compensation should be given if an employee is fired. Yes! One month's notice should given. Then appellate authority, the labour officer you met. He should order to take you back or to give compensation. One month notice before dismissing. Then appellate authority... The labour officer. He should order to take you back or to give compensation. I don't think he would do that. Then you can go to court. Let court case be the last option. See, this says... Break should be given in between work hours. One hour rest after four hours of work is mandatory. They can't make you work for more than 10 hours, including overtime. More than 8 hours work should be paid for overtime. Oh, is this what the law says! That's what I told you, there are laws for everything. There should be a law against lewd comments. What do you mean? Hey, I am not going back to work. You don't get disheartened. Heard the lawyer? There are laws to help us. Let's see. Not that. I have worked there for 10 years. As per these labour rules... I deserve a good compensation. With that, I can open a shop near my house. Isn't it better than working for 10-11 hours... ...listening to Saji's obscenities... ...without being able to even sit down or pee? What shop will you start? It can be anything. Do you know how to do business? Oh, if that Saji can, why can't I? Ah. What is it, dear? Need a recommendation? I want my job back. I told you, I appointed a new girl. A pleasant face. You can't do that. Why? You can't, that's all. Why, I am asking. One minute. Good morning, sir. Good morning! You please come fast! I am not getting the right words. You know what, that Bablu... ...you come and see for yourself. Come fast. I will talk, you all stay calm. I will talk, OK? Didn't you go? I won't go until you take me back. Are you striking? Prasad, I don't even know what a strike is. I cannot do without a job. Prasad, better you take her back. Else, we will have to go on a strike. You go to the labour officer or beyond, there are courts in this country. There are laws here, even against lewd comments. Tell him that. According to Supreme Court, suggesting to pee in a bottle is sexual harassment. What are you saying! Sexual?! I have a family. Didn't you ask me, "I allow, will you allow"? I was just joking. Yeah, that is a lewd comment. Is that your problem? Supreme court in Vishakha case says... ...passing lewd comments about female bodies is sexual harassment. Please stop saying 'sexual... sexual...'. We are respectable people. That's the term for it. We can't help it. Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishment Act 1960 Chapter 4, section 18 says... ...you cannot fire workers without prior notice. There should be a reason and a month's notice. There is a reason, she went on strike. If that is the reason, form a committee and enquire. You should prove that the reason is valid. - Not that... - Dear, that pant. Sister, shawl. You should have seen Saji's face... ...when he gave me Rs. 1.5 Lakhs. I invited him for the inauguration of this mess. He didn't come. You know Ajitha, right? I have worked with her for a long time. Everyone here knows that. I have now memorised these laws. Which one? Yes, that one. Can you take it out? This? - This... - Black one. Take that one. Right person I asked to be pleasant! Will give this one next Monday. I can't, Viji. Did he create some problem again? No. I can't pee in the dressing room. Can't even stand properly because of this itch. Can't do without a toilet. Toilet building comes under the Corporation. Who should we go and see? The mayor. Mayor will do something if the trade union asks. But then they will ask us to take memberships. No use going to that oldie and that stupid fellow there. There will be somebody above the Mayor, right? District Collector is there. But no use just going there directly. Told you from the beginning, we should call everybody. Call everybody and do a biryani feast! She keeps saying, call everybody! But, she has a point. Let's do a signature campaign from SM street and submit it to the collector? Yea, Ananya.. Sabitha, sit... Please sit down. You didn't call us when you went to the union. Now, this too. We came to know about this only because we dropped in now. Do we not pee? I'm not sure, will people cooperate if these people ask for signatures? You keep quiet. No point in just going to the collector with the signatures. Somebody should recommend. Also, we collect signatures of our women. Don't think they will give you theirs. But you are not female! Honestly... ...I still have not understood it clearly. What are they? Where do they pee from? I want to ask them all this. But you cannot talk about them, it will then become an issue. Can't talk about them. There is no point. You can't waste time clearing each of their questions. Yes, I'm used to it now. People stare at us on the roads. We can't advise them all... ...or impart knowledge to everyone. I told you to shut up! Ajitha, hello! Ajitha, yes. This toilet protest is getting worse. What to do? Hello, district collector? This is Ajitha from 'Anweshi'. The issue of unorganised female workers of SM street. No shop owner is giving them toilet facility. The provisions for toilets are converted to store rooms. More than 80% of the workers there are women. They are worried about being expelled at any time. The guy from the shopkeeper's association says... ...if women want to use the toilet... ...they should leave jobs and stay at home. You must do something. This what I've to say. OK, sir. Hope you will call an all party meeting soon. Let's go? - Who's this? - It's me, Aswathy. You're dressed like a robber. If the collector is on the employers' side, he shouldn't recognise me. Who's this, then? Got her while collecting signatures. I'm Lissie, studying in Providence college. Do you mind if I shoot this as a documentary? What do you mean by a documentary? Like a film, but... ...the people and incidents will be real. Do you mind if I shoot what you are doing? Aren't you the one who left from that play in between, on that day? Yes, I was in it. What happened that day, dear? The other girl forgot her dialogue. We don't know if they would allow to shoot inside. Come along, it is good to have a camera with us. Let me see. E-toilets are used successfully in foreign countries. I don't know why it is not happening here. Which toilet, sir? Electronic toilet. It can be installed anywhere. Cleans by itself. You can put money into it and use. How much money? A small amount, one rupee or so. We can look for free ones also. Won't it take a lot of time to set up these? Everything takes its time, right? Not just that, sir. We transgenders have been asking to consider us for these jobs. There has been no action on that front. There is nothing in the law to prevent employing you. But nobody considers us for sales jobs. It is very hard for us to find jobs. Not sure if I can do anything about it now. E-toilet is OK. But buildings need toilets. Plans have the provisions. I will have orders issued for both. Toilets in the building and e-toilets. Building toilets are your responsibility. You have one month's time. That was the time when... ...a girl used the toilet in Sagar hotel... ...and it was captured with a hidden camera. Also in Kochi... A sales girl was accused of theft and she was strip searched. Similarly, in Vijayalakshmi here... Female workers were only allowed to use the toilet outside. They travel an hour and a half or more daily to work. After 40, you cannot know the exact day of periods. It can come on any date. If they get their periods on the way to work... ...they can start work only after freshening up in the shop toilet. Shop owners come by 11 or 12 o'clock only. Workers can't use the bathrooms inside, they are for customers. So, they wait outside the bathroom to get freshened up. They have to stand there. The owner comes and opens it. When we asked about it, they claimed that... ...the women steal clothes, hide them inside their panties or skirts. Things are not as you think, they say. So, we had to deal with them in that way. That issue in Kochi, the Sagar hotel one... ...and our strikes happened almost at the same time. That was when the collector intervened to take action. It got media attention as well. So the collector took action. Inauguration of the first ever e-toilet in Kerala, ...will be done now by the honourable district collector. Sir, please come. Please open it, sir. You can flush and inaugurate it. OK. - I can flush it, right? - Yes. Not working. Not working? Please press again. Please press it, sir? A minor technical issue, please remain impatient. Patient... Yes, please remain patient. Keep the glossy vessels to the front. - All of them are glossy. - You just listen to me! Can I buy some diapers for you? If you have to go every minute like this, diapers will be better. Oh... Open! Somebody, please open. I am stuck here, somebody please open. Oh, no... Open! 'I wished you were here...' We should keep our city clean. 'I wished you were here...' Move! Using toilet for this! 'Wished for a moment...' 'Wished for a moment...' '...that you were near me' No need to be here... Sajin, hey... Bring the receipt when you come to collect it. Sister, give me two rupees, urgent! What happened to you? Give me two rupees. Your shop is nearer than my shop. Where are you coming from? I went to Samco to pee. They said strikers can't use it for free. Oh, you wait there. I can't! Bill is on the table. Bring Aswathy along. Why are you asking for money? Give it to me. - Sister! - You keep quiet. You want money when people are desperate to pee! It's the same rule for all, everyone here pays to use it. Give her the key first, then we will talk about rules. Give two rupees, first. You give the key first! I won't give the key without payment Let's see if it can be done. Sajna... Ohh... So, this is your capacity for holding pee! Heard they charged a case against me. International women's day was around then. Police told me that an FIR has been filed. That I should stay away for some time. But how could I, it was women's day. I said go ahead with the case. Arrest me, no issues. Tell me the reason also. They should come out with a reason, right? I said they can arrest me. Viji, collector ordered to build toilets within 6 months, right? Not about installing e-toilets. Collector's order is... ...to build toilets in all the buildings. E-toilets are to be in addition to it. That's what I also said. Viji, none of this will work out... ...until we build the toilets ourselves. We building toilets? Why, can we not do it? I am talking about building it with cement and concrete. Damn! why didn't I think of this... Today, at 3 am, 'Penkoottu' activists tried to break into a shop in Samco bazaar. Shop owners are in discussion with 'Penkoottu' leader Viji, right now. The shop is built in the area earmarked for toilet in the plan... ...and they would take over and build a toilet there, says 'Penkoottu'. Here she comes again! My family will kick me out. My folks don't even know about this yet. They will get to know from the TV. You are not the only one with problems. Let's wait there. If police comes to arrest, there will be a mob here. They will say whatever they like. It will backfire if an inquiry comes. What backfire... The labour officer is on our side. Are you afraid of her? You were down with fever for two days because you are not scared of her? My worry is the complaints of sexual harassment. It's a real mess. Not that... The labour officer will change sides if he sees these cameras and all, I'm sure. Let me tell you... These people are crazy. No brains. The room they broke into, what's it used as? The godown of 5-6 shops. We built that store room in the place assigned for toilets. It has become common knowledge and now, it came on TV also. Better than building one toilet in every complex... ...we can contain this by building one here. KEEP THE WASHROOM CLEAN I am still not in favor of this. There was no need to construct toilets. No, Shaji is right there. It cost us just one toilet. We would have been in trouble if they had continued to protest. We would need to build ten otherwise. I'm sure. What can they do? We should have called the police. Hey, the whole game would change if the police arrested them. They have trans-people on their side. That Ajitha and all will make it a huge issue. - Which Ajitha? - Naxal Ajitha. She once killed a police man and smeared the walls with his blood. Very dangerous. Thankfully, it is over without costing us much. Viji sister, I have... My dear, don't come up with another idea, please! I applied for passport. Should check next week. Viji sister, that one toilet is not enough. We need at least 10 such toilets in SM street. That's right. We have to work for 10-12 hours, but we are not allowed to sit down. Is that fair? You chit chat and extend the lunch break. It must be very comfortable to sit and chat. Are we sitting on his lap? We should not leave this like that. We should gather everybody. This is not done. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Ammu... Happy birthday to you. Your hand... Here... See, let us upload this one. Isn't this better? That's also OK. This one? Okay. Let's play... Green for me Ammu! Dear. Ammu! Yes, mom. Here, these are for Sharadamma and Manikkuttan. Hold it straight. - Don't mix them up. - Yes, mom. I know! - Give Princy a miss call. - Yeah. Yeah. There won't be enough for you to pack tomorrow. Wait, take this too. Give me that phone. Go play with balloons. Here's the balloon. Tap it, tap it. I won't smash it too high. - Cake cutting over? - Yeah. - Where's the birthday girl? - She's over there. I wanted to come too. That's when Jincy's kids dropped in from Changanassery. Georgie and Justin. Oh, from the Gulf... Aren't they? They just stepped out yesterday, after quarantine. Didn't even phone to say they were coming. Oh, that is OK, sister. What is this? Chapati and chicken. Mmm... it smells so good. Oh, you would have finished dinner by now. No. Didn't eat anything much. Okay. - Did Annayi make all this? - No way! So, see you tomorrow. Pass me that. Some mystus fish have come. You will drain the torch battery before it is dark. Even the phone doesn't have charge. Add cheddar cheese if you have it. Else, it's OK. It'll be tastier if you mix both. Let's bake this again now. I haven't turned off the oven. It's kept as such. It'll cool off otherwise. We will then have to preheat it. So, I kept it on. Let's put the pizza inside. Has Shibu stopped selling lottery and started fishing? Mmm. Shibu caught these with his hand net. Remembered that you like it. So I brought a handful from that. How is your sister in law? Oh, I sent the birthday cake and all, through Shibu. You drink it. - Princy aunty gave you only this? - Yes Mom, this is not how it has to be done. Then? It needs many more ingredients. See this? Yeah... You could have asked Princy aunty only. They got everything there. Oh, I am going to make this in my way. Eat if you want. Fine! I am not going to post it on Insta. Sumi... Sumi! Ammu! [Phone rings] Were you in class? - Yes. aunty. - Where's your mom? She just went to the shop. Keep this in the freezer. - OK. - Careful! Tell your mother as soon as she comes. OK, will tell. Cumin seeds, two packets of 100g each. Cumin seeds, two packets of 100g each Raisins 150g. Raisins 150g. Ground nuts 250g. Ground nuts 250g. Ghee for Rs. 157, one bottle.

That's all. - May I leave then? - OK. - OK then, see you tomorrow. - OK. Haneef! OK. Biscuit, Sambar powder, chilli powder, peanut candy, Munch. Peanut candy and Munch, will give tomorrow when load comes. Will send the rest. How much, now? Adding last time's due, Rs. 370. - Will settle the balance later. - OK. A half litre soda... You should make fish molly with these types of fish. Or, mappas. She doesn't know to cook all this. Annayi... Yes. Looks like seer fish is pretty cheap these days. Or, have you won some lottery? Yeah, in a small way. In a small way... Annayi! We are going to Guruvayoor tomorrow. Do you want us to take any ticket for you? The lottery prize won't go to Guruvayoor this time. It will be in Wayanad this time. Let me know if you are going Wayanad side. If I need to go to Guruvayoor, why should I go to Wayanad? You go to whatever hell you want. Sumi! Yeah... Yes, sister. Sumi, please take that fish from the freezer and keep outside. Which fish? I had given it to Ammu yesterday. Just keep it outside the freezer, I will just go to the town and be back. Okay. [Phone rings] I have told you many times not to go to other houses and eat! Now, you go get it from somewhere. Those fish are so damn costly. I don't have any money with me. How would I know it was given to keep in the freezer? It's all because of Ammu. She should have told me. I don't how you are going to do it... ..just come to the market with money. I am starting from here. - Brother... - Yeah. Can I get seer fish? Seer fish is not there. You come tomorrow at around 5 or 6 o'clock. Or, if you like pomfret or tuna, ... from the evening stalls, I can get you now. No, that won't do. I want seer fish itself. First of all, it is not the season. Restaurants and wedding caterers come and buy in the morning itself. Oh. If you still want it urgently, check in the big market. It could be there in the big market, right? Not sure, you try. OK, then. Seer fish is not available here. I am going to the big market now. Please arrange the money somehow and come there. What will I do if you say like this? Today the load comes to the shop, Can't ask for money and all. We borrowed money for Ammu's birthday, you know that. Hmm. Anyway, you go there. Let me see what I can do. OK. 2.2 kg, packing this. OK? Here it is. Sister. Can you give me the mid piece of it? 2 kg of uncut piece? Even this is good, fresh fish. I had kept it aside to take home. Only Rs. 1,700. No, I can't take the cut pieces... It will be now difficult to get another one. A middle piece...? 2 kg seer fish, middle piece. You wait then. Let me call and check. OK. - Hello Princy, I've just come to the town. - Hello. I have kept the fish outside. OK, I didn't see anybody here. That's why I called you. Call me when you are back. I need it only by evening. OK, then. OK. The person will come there,you keep it ready. OK, right. Sister, I have arranged the fish. You go to Samudra fish stall in Kaichoondi junction. Just pay Rs. 1,700. He is our party only. - Oh OK. - I have told him. - OK, then. - OK. Give it to me. Here. Dear, can I come to the shop? Will you keep the money ready? What can I do, if you suddenly tell me like this? We could have done something after I get home. Or else, tomorrow? How can I tell her that? She needs it today, right? You talk to Princy. She would understand it if you tell her what happened. I understand what you are saying. But I am not at home right now. I'm here in the hospital, right? It'll be at least 6 or 7 o'clock when I reach. It is just a matter of 2000 rupees. Will send it with the kids as soon as I reach. OK, I am keeping the phone. I will call you. With beef, we can make curry. We will fry it along with grated coconut. Let us cut chicken into small pieces and fry. Duck, in the usual style, with coconut milk and pepper. Lobster and pearl spot we can fry. Georgie likes them fried. What about the seer fish? Oh, this is also there? We will make it into curry. You soak some cocum then. My dear brother, what is the use of bringing out such expensive cars here! We can only show it off in the car porch. These premium cars you mentioned are driven by commoners there. Buy a car that you can use here. I was just giving it a thought... ...not confirmed. Then, we can consider some other options. OK, let's see. 'Bring on some music for this silent night.' 'Bring it on.' 'Bring on some music for this silent night.' 'Bring it on.' 'Get a drum...' Don't just hold it, drink. Somebody here said enough, but had 8 pegs after that. Good, anyway. Don't leave anything, please eat well. I am going to bed. Good night, then. Go away! Mother, you see that tree? How many times my father had tied me to it and beaten me up! Have you ever asked him why he was beating me up? Or told him to stop beating me up? I never got any support from my father or mother in my life. Then how can you say that I should help you? Now, relatives and neighbours say I should take care of my mother. How can I take care of you? I don't love you. Shouldn't I feel like caring for you? We are leaving this house. Or, you should leave if you care about us. Hey, did you see this troll? So funny! Why don't we put it in our group? Let them watch. Hats off to the guys who create these. My God! Hey, what happened to you? You seem so cold this morning. Drank a couple of pegs already? Look here... My last drink was when I got my pension last month. After that, I'm going to drink today. Do one thing. When you get pension, buy half a litre and come to Sabu's studio. By then, I'll bring some chips and beef. Now, put on your mask. Baby George! Hey, they called your name. Go. Baby, here is your bag and phone. Take these too. Here! Baby George... Babychaya! How many pegs did you have on pension day? Babychaya! Change your dress, I'll serve lunch. Dear... Come here and eat. Dear! I said come and eat. Eat your lunch. What happened to you? Shouldn't I collect the pension? Eh, where did you go in the morning then? Let me see... Money is there. You drank, right? Did you drink today? No. Let me see. Blow! What happened to you, dear? I am... ...not feeling well. What happened? Tell me what you feel. In Baby George's case... it is not any major issue like Alzheimer's. But it's common among the elderly. A type of Dementia. We call it vascular cognitive impairment. Loss of memory, talking about totally unrelated things... ...and lack of coordination. Also, focal deficit in hand or leg movements. These are the common symptoms. Patients with BP, diabetes, stroke... ...and heart attack should be extra careful. They should keep it under control. And take the medicines regularly. We should also make sure that he is always active. Let's see. We'll make him recover with medication. Let him take medicines for a month. We'll do an MRI after that. OK then. Dad used to call so many times a day! Tell him the little girl is calling, he might come. I called, but he is not coming. He is just lying down there. Mom, let's take him to the Indo-American hospital in Vaikom? It's always good to take a second opinion. Mom, listen to what we say at least now. Hire a maid. Somebody to look after dad and to help you out. Okay, I'll look out for somebody. Did you all get the vaccine? I got both the doses. The one who got the booster dose too is driving the car. Dear, why don't you learn to do these things by yourself? Someone can't be with you all the time, right? I'm not well, Lali. You will get used to it if you do it for two days. Don't give him tea now. Let him come back. Get ready fast. Drink tea after you come back from the walk. Give me that tea. Tea is good, but not sweet. Sir, madam said not to add sugar as you are diabetic. Please add some sugar. Isn't the tea so good? Add some. Babychaya, coming? Babychaya, where are you headed this early? Just got out for a walk. Ah, alright. See you. Sir, where did you go? I went for a walk. Don't tell Lali. Pack 2 kilos of jackfruit pudding together for dispatch. Sure. Cut the jackfruit into smaller pieces. Only then it'll come out crispy. Dhanu... Dhanu, why are you washing the clothes here? Don't we have a washing machine here? Yeah, but this is to make the clothes cleaner... That's okay. Clothes will be clean if you use the washing machine also. Who are these things invented for? Wash only in that. Where are you going? To the shop, to buy grocery. Will you buy me a laddoo? Sir, you're not allowed to eat sweets. I'm craving to eat laddoo. Can you buy me a laddoo? And don't tell anybody, okay? Sir, you don't go for walks, won't do any work. You're just sitting idle here. Will you join me to work in the vegetable garden? Then, how can I buy you laddoo? Will you buy me two laddoos? Will buy you a single one. You should work with me in the vegetable garden. OK? Right. What was the problem at home, today? Your mom called in the morning. My beard is the new issue, Lali aunty. The beard. I posted a photo on Facebook. Seeing that, she, my sister... ...called my mom from America and created a big ruckus. If I post a photo, what can happen to her in Chicago? That is not the real issue. They don't want me to stay in my hometown. Either I should go to the UK or to New Zealand. At least I should pack myself to Bangalore! Lali aunty, you know... I've a livelihood, I'm building a life here. What will I do if they start like this? They won't let me live with my aged parents in my hometown. Now, if mom calls, tell her that I'm not going anywhere. You don't go anywhere. Do what you like to do. What a beautiful river! And you all bathe in bathrooms! You would feel so fresh if you bathe in this water. Jalebi... Jalebi? You said laddoo. Yeah, laddoo. But for that, what work did you do... ...other than just standing there holding a hoe? 'The bowl of sadness...' 'In my hands, God...' 'In my hands, God...' Dear, why don't you wipe these windows? Won't you do? No... Don't say that. Didn't the doctor tell you to keep doing some work? I am not well, Lali. That's OK. Do what you can. Stop when you are tired. But do it, OK? Lali... Mmm? I forgot a song. Which song, dear? I'm not getting it. A song by P Bhaskaran and Baburaj. Mmm. I forgot. Is it "Innale mayangumbol"? Not that one. Then? Can you recollect any words in the song? No... I am not getting it, Lali. Which song can that be? Mmm? Remember, O most gracious Mother, that never was it known that anyone who fled... ...to your abode, seeking your help or intercession, was left unaided. O Queen of virgins, my merciful Mother. Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto your feet. With sighs and tears, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions... ...but in your mercy, hear and answer me. Amen. Show me your hand. What is this? Offering from the temple. How sweet it is! Give me some more. We Christians don't have rituals like these. When traders buy jackfruit... ...they give us a maximum of only 20 rupees. They reduce it even further giving some excuse. But if we can make value-added products from these same fruits... ...one jackfruit can fetch us at least Rs. 1,500. We know, during the season, ...a lot of these lie on roadside, and go waste. I feel really bad about it. Just from these fruits that go waste... ... can a community... A community can make financial progress. Please continue. I will join back soon. Dhanu, what was that? I went to switch off the motor. You ran for that? I got scared. What if you trip and fall down? Nothing will happen, Ma'am. Didn't you go to the temple? No. Why? If I go to the temple daily, who will do the chores here? Ma'am will fire me. Lali... Did you tell her not to go to temple? What, dear? Everyone has their own religious things. Hmm... If somebody tells Lali not to go to church, won't you go, Lali? No, I haven't told her anything. You haven't? No! Lali didn't stop you from going to temple. So? You go. Daily. I don't feel like going to a temple everyday. I go when I feel like it. Why don't you go daily? Lali won't say anything. You go. Sir, what do you want now? Want paayasam? Can we make it here secretly? Dhanu, you must taste this. Nobody can make out it is jackfruit. Meat is no match for this, It's so tasty! Can we buy Sugarfree sweetener for sir? Hey, that will not work. We have tried it before. He will add 2-3 spoons of it. It is not good for his health, right? I made him stop the habit. He has forgotten it now. Don't remind him, Dhanu. Dear... Dear... We... We have such a big house... ...and several rooms in here. I'm thinking of starting an old age home here. With that, you too can keep yourself busy with something. Are you listening? Will the children agree? Oh, who needs their permission? This is our house. We'll do what we like. You just have to stand by me. It's not like in the past. We can make good money out of it. Won't you admit poor people, madam? Of course, I will. When some of them pay, poor people can also be accommodated. Will you make rasam tomorrow, like the other day? Sure, I'll make it for you. Who am I telling all this to! Babychaya, you know the route to Gopalakrishnan sir's house, right? Yes. Don't go to Gopalakrishnan's house. Let us go to Mareena bar. - To the bar? - Yeah. You know what will happen if Lali aunty comes to know this. Lali will not know. Babychaya, if you want to have a couple of drinks, have it at home. I can bring it. Really feel like having a drink at the bar. One drink... Just one would do. One drink, are you sure? Yes. You won't change your mind when you reach there, right? No... Sister, do you mind if we go to the bar? He is the boss. What can I say? I don't mind going to a bar. I had worked at the Kumali bar for three years. Lali should not come to know. Like how we agreed, only one peg. First a 30 ml, then another 30 ml. Then one more 30. Then one more 30! Sir. - MH... 90. - OK. Brother, just give him a 30 now. OK. Anything to eat? Duck egg. We don't have it, sir. Duck egg, sprinkled with salt and pepper... Cut into round pieces... Sir, that was a long time ago. We don't serve it anymore. You've come here several times after that. Sir, how about something else? Chicken 65, beef fry or something like that? Bring a 30 ml first, we will order afterwards. OK. Want to have a drink? It's a nice feeling. Baby sir, you have. I don't want. No duck eggs here. They are so yummy. Will they have quail eggs? 'Full moon spreads its milky glow...' 'In those cool fragrant nights...' 'In the corner of my teary eye, appears...' 'In the corner of my teary eye, appears...' 'A playhouse built by memories...' 'A playhouse built by memories...' 'Full moon spreads its milky glow...' 'In those cool fragrant nights...' Here is your dress, sir. Wear these and sit quietly here. Don't step out. It will be a problem if ma'am comes to know. Let's go to Kani Annan's shop tomorrow to eat banana bonda. We will call Josy also. He is fun to be with. Let's go. Hmm. Baby sir, you go and eat banana bonda or have liquor. I'll not come. Why? I'm not coming. Even today, you had agreed for one peg and then? There is no harm in having a couple of drinks. Even the doctors advise that. Do you see anything wrong in me? Whatever it is, I am not coming. Won't you come? I cannot lie to ma'am. So you won't come? I know... Nobody likes me... I am sick, that's why. I've to beg even for a candy. You won't give me a candy, will you? I too have desires... Have you people put me in jail? I'd asked you for paayasam, you did not make. Right? It's better I die. Ma'am, can we make paayasam tomorrow? Yes Dhanu, what is the occasion? Nothing special. Sir was asking... Oh no! His blood sugar, cholesterol and BP are all high. Dhanu, tell some excuse and comfort him. If I tell, there will be an argument. He is like this because he is unwell. Before, we used to fight a lot. I don't want banana bonda. Can you buy me a radio? There is cash in my bag. OK, we will buy. You should talk to me. Will do. Mom, do you even know what is happening there? Dad had gone to the bar with a woman. Noby from the bar called me. It's true. I checked with Josy. He drank, sang and made merry! Do you know who he went to the bar with? That maid servant you've hired there! Mom, do have any idea how she is or where she is from? Ruining our reputation! If he so wishes, can he not drink at home? Put some sense into her head! People in the family WhatsApp group are waiting for something like this! Amma, just stop your jackfruit business by today, OK? Your only responsibility is to look after dad. Do you understand? Mom, do you understand? I am looking after him to my best. In case that's not enough, I've appointed a help too. If she has a problem, let's bring someone else. Don't think that you can make me stop the things I do. I lived for all of you all these years. I started doing the things I like only now. Let me live my life the way I want. I don't want my children or their spouses to call me for this. Dhanu, you go sleep. Why didn't you tell me if you wanted to drink? Would you have given me if I had asked? Lali, how long has it been since you gave me a tea that's sweet? Isn't it because you are unwell? Is it a problem that I am being more attentive now? Attentive? Do you pay any attention to me, Lali? How long has it been since you even noticed me? How much have you noticed me in the last 36 years? I am not well, Lali. Give me some peace of mind, please. Dhanu, I appointed you to look after sir properly, right? And what did you do to me? I don't really mind that you guys went to the bar or drank. But you could have told me about it. Did you hear how the children spoke to me yesterday? This is more that what I owe you, Dhanu. I don't want anything more, ma'am. Getting ousted from a place or losing job... ...is not something new to me in my life. I am used to it. You please don't worry, ma'am. Dhanu, please try to understand my situation. I understand, ma'am. Likewise, you also please try to understand my situation. Understand the state sir is in. If each of us... ...understand one another, only then... Where are you going? I am going out. Will you buy a radio? Hmm. I'll buy. The number you have dialled is invalid. Please check the number you have dialled. Hello, Dhanu PRA THOO MU The waist thread tangled in cloth complained. Comrade, on your soft body... Wish I get some cold. You bloody bearded romantic! Listen to the remaining lines. Okay, sing. Body sweated, lust froze as stone. At that time, as a warm smile... A short fart comes this way. This guy is unbelievable! You're a real artist, Prathapan. Next level! You got more? I'll lose my value if I sing all the time. Got it? A small fart comes this way! Answer that phone or disconnect. It's been ringing for long. Why don't you answer? It's ringing inside my head. Lakshmanan, collect the cash promptly after the job. Don't stand like a beggar because it's a minister's house. When I demand money, don't interfere. I'll be damn pissed. Mind it. PREFACE Balan, don't leave. I'll be right back. - Mariya... - Yeah. Mariya... Here you go. It's Tuna. Bloody nuisance! Jesus, when will I cook these! Sir... - Eat fast. - I'm eating! Hey, you! Where are you rushing? Who was it? Where is sir? Where's sir, sister? No water here. Switch on the motor. - Subhash, Kannan. Come here. - Sir. Sir! - Sir! - Who opened the door? Subhash? What happened, eh? What? Sir, this is not right. Huh? What's the matter? I had told you not to do it. Oh, that? You let it go, okay? Moreover, mine is special, right? Sir, don't talk like a d... Where the hell did you enter? Scumbag, why are you here? Is there no one to throw him out? Sir, you please go. You meant to say... I shouldn't talk like a dick, right? To a minister... Inside his house... In front of so many people... Isn't it wrong to say that? Isn't it wrong? Tell me, isn't it? Isn't it wrong, bastard? Is this your father's dung plastered floor that you can dirty like this? You'll leave only after properly wiping it clean, got it? Nair, take him away dammit. Just throw him away. What are you waiting for? Stop these soft touches and just pull him away. He has pasted it all over the floor. What? What are you staring at? Bloody son a swine. Your dad is the swine. DATA COLLECTION Brother, I'm calling from Ananthapuram in Thammanam. Our septic tank is full. Can you come and clean it? - I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back. - Listen, I... Meeting? And him? Does anyone take me seriously? I know all that. - What do you want me to do? - Only five or six people came. Ramakrishnan, please pressurize them. We can't kill a man for him. - We too work hard... - I get it. Only a couple of channels are here. Asianet... Kaumudi is also here. 24 too. Please try, Ramakrishnan. If it's so... wait. Prathapan! It seems he can't stop work. Says he will starve. That's not fair. Is it? All are treated the same here. You stop work right now. Just take the vehicle and go home. Just take the vehicle. I won't say a word more! Channels are very few. Looks like someone is pulling the strings. I'll walk nude on the street if needed, Murugan. Mark my words. Then these fuckers will come to shoot it. Your anger is brimming, isn't it brother? Basheer, we too eat as normal humans. Our Lakshmanan was thrashed like shit, and you talk about earning a meal, dog? He is admitted in hospital not sure whether he'll go to a ward or jail. No, stop it. You were his close buddy, right? Dude, you just go and see his condition. Then call Murugan and tell him. Tell Murugan and go to work. That's what I've been telling you, Basheer. Just hang up! What the hell is this, sir? Can't you see it? Flush wasn't working, bro. What's the issue, bro? There's a serious issue. Elders are here. They will explain. Oh, is your problem so serious? Will you block the whole state? It's better to block. - Bro... - Yeah. They're calling you. ALL KERALA SEPTIC TANK CLEANERS' ASSOCIATION Murugan, you start. - You speak, bro. - Someone please speak. Just speak! Glad that you all came here. We are not good at speaking. That's not our job. Tell us about your problem. We know what your job is. Yes, we are cleaners. We clean septic tanks. People call us shit collectors, drainage men, and so on. These are not names we call ourselves. Some of you call us by these names. - Isn't it apt? - Don't ridicule us like that, sir. Rajesh, tell them why we are here. Right, we are indeed shit collectors. Yesterday, a guy in our group was attacked. They almost beat him to death. We don't have anybody to speak for us. So, they will thrash us and even kill us. Whatever happened in minister Thomas's house was an attack, right? - Wasn't the attacker one among you? - Who attacked? Who attacked whom? Don't use terms such as 'attacked' loosely. It wasn't like what you said. Tell us what you know and then we will talk. You went to the minister's house for work and then attacked you. Isn't that the case? Why? Sir, there has to be a reason for it, right? Your guy misbehaved with the minister's wife. When the minister questioned, he was kicked on the chest. The victim has given a statement. Victim? If she is a victim, what are we? Pests? Do you belong to the Kerala association? Yes, brother. My father had cleaned a lot of shit here. I too have cleaned a lot. If needed, my child would also do it. You know why? This business has less competition. And there are lot of clients, okay? But that's not the problem. Are you saying the minister has given a fake complaint? That's a shit case, sir. You speak, brother. They thrashed my boy. Almost beat him to death. We had gone there to do our work. CONTENTS - Dude, will it take too long? - No, just four hours. It's a problem if it rains. Okay if it drizzles, but heavy rain will make it difficult. Oh, will it be difficult for you to transport it? It will leak and come down. That's the problem. That will be trouble. What about the stench? There won't be any stench. We'll manage with a powder on top. - Hi. - Go without touching us. - Sir, another thing... - Yes. Please tell the family not to use the toilet for the next four hours. Not a problem. It's a matter of just four hours. No worries. For urgency, there is a servants' toilet outside. That's not connected to this tank. So it's okay. - You finish this fast. - Then no problem. It'll be over soon We have other work after this. We came fast because it's in this house. So, you're super busy. Must be making a lot of money. - Can you give it to us? - Coming. Okay, carry on with your work. - Lakshmanan... - Yes? Prathapan, you've tied it too tight. Weren't you the one who tied it? Prathapan, that pipe is broken. Be careful. Careful, dude. Hold this. - Here, hold it. - Slowly. Ma'am, septic tank cleaners are here. Don't use the toilet for three to four hours. - No. We all are done. - Then it's okay. What's the breakfast today? This was cleaned recently. - I remember this tree. - Oh. Basheer and all of us had done it together. A guy injured his hand too. Dude, stamp on this. My goodness, Prathapan. It'll be a problem if someone sees you. He is our minister. - Brother. - Yeah? I think it's blocked. No, dude. It's the motor. Come down. - Bro. - Yes. I'm working in such a big house for the first time. - Talk softly. - It's a minister's house too. Lakshmanan, what's this minister's post? Ports and archeology. Why did you laugh? Such a big shot calls us for help. Aren't we rock stars? You know, day before yesterday, the blue house with a lawn in Vypin... - The house with that huge dog. - It's Padmagopan's house. - Film star? - Gopan's house? Why didn't you tell me? I watched his film yesterday also. - Which film? - Forgot its name. - But I didn't see him at all. - He has another house, idiot. - Prathapan... - Yes. That Johny, right? He was trying for this work. - He had called at night to abuse. - Asshole wants a share. What did you tell him? I said I'll hit him at his house if he talks like this. Okay, well said. - This should be cleaned manually. - Yeah, get in. - Stop the motor. - OK. - I'll go in. - No, I'll do this. You'll ask for more money. Hello! Hi, brother. Hello, sir. - Okay. So you are Malayalees. - Yes. - Where are you from? - Ernakulam Puthiya Kavu. Puthiya Kavu... Oh, our Jayadevan's constituency, right? - Yes. - Okay. - All well? Did you eat food? - Yeah. We ate. What are your names? Lakshmanan, Gopi. And me, Prathapan. Prathapan. Good name. Carry on. See you. Among those who hate to touch own shit... How great is the one who picks up others' shit. I should send this poem to Mathrubhumi magazine. A minister spoke to us. Amazing, right? - But you didn't speak a word. - He asked how are you to all of us. Such a good man. No, I don't want. - Gopi, it's blocked as you said. - That's what I told you earlier. - Isn't the motor off, Gopi? - Yes. Careful. - It's fully clogged. - Time to change it. [Hums a song] Oh yeah... Gopi, all these look like loose motion. - What's it, man? - Didn't we see a bike on our way? - How much does it cost? - Planning to buy that? - Yeah. - Who will you take on it? He is a rich guy. Don't know how long he will do this. Fuck! Gopi, take the water. Gopi, water! Stop. Stop there, man. Wash. Wash your face! Hold on, man. Wash, wash again. Lakshmanan, don't go. Don't go.
