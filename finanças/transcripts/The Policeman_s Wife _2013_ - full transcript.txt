Why can't you get up and say goodnight? Is it too much to ask that I should know where you are? Is that too much to ask? Time to get up, Clara. My dear. Get up! I want to sleep. No, you have to get up. Wake up! Come on! Somebody's tired, hmm? Come on! Take off your pyjamas. Come on. So, come on. Through wind and snow St. Martin rode, Upon his steed that swiftly trod. St. Martin rode in cheerful mood, Wrapped warm and snug inside... his cloak. Down below, in the snow, There crouched a poor old man, Dressed in rags, no clothing on. 'Oh, help me in my need,' he cried. 'Or the bitter frost will be my death.' St. Martin... tore his cloak in two And handed half to the man below. 'Thank you, good sir!' the beggar spoke, As St. Martin rode away with half his cloak. So... Earthworms. Hmm. They're all coming out. Look! Let's make another hole. Look! Wow! Look how many there are. So many! They look so pretty. Make them wet. The stone needs washing. It was really dirty. Yes, then you must wash it. I washed the stone, washed the stone. All the stones. - That looks really pretty now. We can put them back down again. - The stones? But then the plants won't come through. Then we must leave it all open. That's right. So the flowers grow. - Always open. Yes. It's a garden. Shall we watch how the things grow? That takes a long time. - A long time? Three or four or five hours.

And I take you by the hand because I like you so. It's such a lovely day, la, Ia, Ia, la, la, Ia. Such a lovely day, la, la, la, Ia, la, la. Such a lovely day, la, la, la, Ia, la, la. Where is Papa? Papa is at work. Shall we go to sleep now? Yes. - Okay, let's... turn the light off. - How do we do that? Wait. Look what I dreamt. Look! We both dreamt that. - Yes. We both dreamt that. We both dreamt that. He's eaten it all. He's eaten it all. He must have been hungry. All gone. Hob's eaten it all. He gets really hungry when there's a storm. Especially when there's a storm? Are you scared? You don't need to be. The storm's a long way away. It's a long way away. It's not where we are. Hmm? I want to go in. Do you think Hob is scared, too? Go on, wake Daddy up. Go on! Go on! Clara! Shall we both wake him up? Say, "Daddy!" - But I don't want to wake Daddy up. Go on... Papa! Kalle got me drunk. Hello! Hello... ow! - Did it sting? Papa stings, huh? Right now! Look, Papa! Look! Blow the candle out! Daddy's just not properly awake yet. Hmm? Really. He hasn't looked at the boat yet. He'll look at it properly in a minute. And then he'll be really pleased. He's just not properly awake yet. Really. Hmm? You did that really well. Papa needs a little more sleep. - Papa, look! You haven't looked properly at the boat yet. Hmm? - You haven't looked at the boat. Uwe! What time is it? Eight. You've still got time. So why did you wake me up? Clara woke you up. She wanted to say "Happy Birthday!" Okay, okay. I'll be in the kitchen. How about Happy Birthday? Many happy returns of the day. It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my birthday! Clara's right outside. -It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my birthday! It's my... My birthday! Swish, swash; swish, swash; dabby, dooby. Swish, swash; swish, swash; dabby, dooby. Two small fish swimming in the sea, blub, blub, blub, blub. One says to other, I've had enough, blub, blub, blub, blub. I want to go back to my little blue pond, For there are sharks in the sea, and maybe they'll eat me. Swish, swash; swish, swash; dabby, dooby. Swish, swash; swish, swash; dabby, dooby. One small fish swimming in the sea, blub, blub, blub, blub. He says to himself, I've had enough, blub, blub, blub, blub. I want to go back to my little blue pond. There are sharks in the sea, and maybe they'll eat me. Swish, swash; swish, swash; dabby, dooby. Swish, swash; swish, swash; dabby, dooby. Come on! Wait, wait. Stop it. - Come on. It has to spin! Finished. Can you turn it off now? Hmm? You still have to rinse you mouth. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Truce! Come on! Truce! Okay, I'll stop. Promise. I think Clara's crying. Nonsense! Yes, yes! Stop. Stop! She really did shout. You can clean up here! I don't want to wear my pyjama trousers. Why not? Because the bear is hitting the other animals. Because the bear is so strong and mean. Because he's so strong. And mean. Just because he's strong, that doesn't mean he's mean, Clara. Look: Hello Bear, I'm the Fox. Are you mean because you're so strong? I'm only strong because my fur is so heavy and so thick. That's why I have to be so strong. Oh, that sounds really logical! But it's true. They're all scared of me. Clara is scared of me because I'm supposed to be mean and hit all the other animals, but that's not true. Not true at all but we only think that because you're so strong. What are you doing here, Mr Horse? Are you scared of me, too? Mr Horse, are you scared of me? - He's bitten the bear. Ouch! Why did you bite me? You must be nice to me. Does Clara like me, too? Say goodnight to the bear. Goodnight. - And to the fox. Goodnight. - And to the deer. Goodnight. Then get out! Without you, I'm nothing. You're my basis. You're the basis of my logistics. You're destroying me. I'm nothing without you. You're destroying me. Without you, I'm nothing. You're my basis. You're destroying me. Ow! Go back to sleep now, Clara. Close your eyes. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama, there are ants in my bed! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! What's the matter? - There are ants! Where? Here. Does it itch there? Here, too. Here and here. Want to come to Mama? - Hmm. Do you know why it tingles like that under your skin? Give me your hand. Look, there are lots of tiny veins. Can you see them? All those tiny blue lines. They run right through your whole body under the skin. Right through. You've got a little one there. And do you know what's inside? There's blood inside. And the blood carries the air that you breathe, and it carries all the food that you've made small in your stomach. And that's why it throbs under your whole skin. It tingles because blood is flowing there. That's why it tingles under your skin. Wait, I'll show you something else. When you put two fingers here and keep still, you can hear... you can feel it beating. Is it beating? Can you feel it beating? That's what tingles under your skin. That's why it tingles. That wasn't ants. That was your blood. That way. Car 4. Klaus, does anyone know where Christine is? Uwe, here. I need to find her; she's forgotten her key. I can't search for private individuals. Yes, I know, I just need to find out where she is. She's forgotten her key, and I need to find out where she is. Everything okay? Car 35. Becker. Fine. Yes, now! Again! They've grown already. - Hmm. Pretty tall, too. And there a lots of little ones... And there's another one, even smaller. - Exactly. Yes, there are a couple of weeds there as well. Rake the earth. You'll loosen it up. And the water gets through more easily. Oh, look! This one's been uprooted. Quick, let's replant it. Can I water them now? When can we water at last? Go and fetch the watering can. Careful, or you'll hurt him. Go to sleep. Go to sleep, Clara. - I want to make friends with Papa. I want to make friends with Papa. Come on, then. Let's go and find him. I want to be friends. I won't make friends with you today. I want to be friends. Go back to bed. Daddy'll come in a minute, Clara! I'm bad. - You're not bad, Clara. Yes, I am. - No, you're not. Yes, I am. - You're not bad. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. - You're not bad, Clara. I am. - No! Yes! I'm bad. - You're not bad. Yes, I am. Come on, go to sleep, Clara. Now go to sleep. I'll go and get Papa. Okay? Clara can't sleep. Now go and comfort her. I can't sleep either, and nobody cares. - I promised her you'd come. You can't do that! - I can. I'll tell you something, Christine... - Go. She's your daughter. She loves you. Don't touch me! Don't ever touch me like that again! Can we be friends? Yeah... sure. Can you read me a story? And asked him to come along for a ride. Can you shut the door? Can we put the siren on? It's too loud. Too loud? Can we put the siren on again? Now it's too loud. Where's your ice cream? It's gone. Fallen down. But don't tell anyone about the siren, okay? And I fly, fly, fly like an airplane! And I'm strong, strong, strong like a tiger! And big, big, big as a giraffe! It's such a lovely day! Such a lovely day! It's such a lovely day! Such a lovely day! It's such a lovely day! 'Cause I like you. Clara? That's mean! They have to go round there. This way, over here. Press number 2. Mummy, you smell. Like I say! It's like I say! Oh, now, oh! Foot to the boards! Okay, come on. Full speed! Crashed. - Crashed. But we went straight ahead. We always end up in the water. We always fall in the water. Full speed! To the left! I wanted to reverse. - We're going to need a floating tire. She's going away again. I've won! Mummy's going away again. Hmm. Going back to bed or something. She went that way. She really does smell. Christine, nobody smokes in this house. Nobody smokes in this house. Nobody smokes in this house. Come here. Come here and let me tell you something. Come here. Come here. I want to tell you a story. Come here. Pinch me. Go on, pinch me. Yes. Harder, harder. Harder. - Does it hurt? No, it doesn't hurt. Mummy has a kind of illness: When you pinch her or when she bumps herself, she gets a big blue mark. Or a yellow one. Or a green one. Pinch me again. That's right. But you don't get a blue mark, and Daddy doesn't, either. But when you pinch mummy, she gets a big blue mark straight away. Or a green one. Or a yellow one. That's because mummy has this illness. And that's why mummy smells? That's right. That's why mummy smells, because of her illness. And that's why mummy has those marks, because of her illness. Sleeping Beauty was a pretty child, pretty child, pretty child; Sleeping Beauty was a pretty child, a pretty child.
