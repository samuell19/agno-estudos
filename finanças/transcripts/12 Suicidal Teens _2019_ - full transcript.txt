Enter the abandoned hospital from the car park. Walk past a large camphor tree and alongside the building... to find the back exit. Enter the passcode given to you and step inside. This is the only entrance. "Main Light Switch" That's odd. There's a vault in "Reception". Inside are numbered plates. Take the lowest number for arrival sequence. The multipurpose room on the basement floor... ...will be the "assembly room" for our gathering. Meeting time is noon, but the room will open an hour in advance. So feel free to arrive after 11 a.m. You must not cry. Here for the assembly? Is this really the right place? I'm glad. The entrance should be there. Yes. You too, huh? Yeah. Assembly, right? It's happening in the basement. Elevator's not working. "Turn the dial to..." What's this? No wonder. Was this you? N-n-n-no... Here for the assembly? I wa-wanted to see the sky f-f-first before going down. So I c-c-came up here. It's a nice roof. Spacious. Yeah, it w-w-was. Let's go! Basement. We need to get a number first. Have you? N-n-not yet. Already? Basement. Basement. I'm guessing he's the organizer of this assembly. Cause he's No. 1? Who can enter this room first? Oh yeah. Well. It's nearly noon. At noon, even if not all are present... proceed or have talks to proceed. That's the rule. One has already gone ahead, so we're all here. Did he really go and die first? He obviously made the decision ahead of us. Selfish dude. Shall we decide, then? Those in favor of proceeding... Sorry I'm late. I'm No. 1, Satoshi. I manage the site. I invited you and made the preparations. Sent you the back door and safe passcode. I am able to confirm your identities as the right participants. Allow me to now explain this assembly. You've all come here to make a big choice. A life or death choice. In short, all 12 of us are here today... to euthanize ourselves. I have a question, Satoshi. Yes? There should be 12 of us, including you. Yes. 12 people including me. But there are 13 people here now. Him. Who is that person? "12 Suicidal Teens" I'm No. 2, Kenichi. No. 3, Mitsue. No. 4, Ryoko. No. 5, Shinjiro. I'm Meiko... Oh, No. 6. No. 7, Anri. N-n-no. 8, Ta-Ta-Takahiro. No. 9, Nobuo. Seigo. No. 11! I'm Mai. No. 12, Yuki. Thank you. Your names all match my participants list. So he's an outsider? It seems so. What do we do in that case? As I told you, we all must proceed. Given the circumstances, we must vote. If someone says "No"? We talk until we all say "Yes." But you're free to quit any time. Wait! So if we all say no, it's cancelled? We can't do that! I'm sure we all agree. Those opposed should raise their hands. That's fine. Anyone against proceeding immediately, raise your hands. What? Why? What do you mean "Why"? We have one dissenter, so let's talk. What a pain in the ass. Because this is weird. Why the outsider? He must've known about this assembly. How'd he know? Maybe he overheard Satoshi talking to us. H-h-hacking, you mean? Excuse me, um... Ta-Ta-Takahiro. Why do you stutter? That's rude. Somehow the time and place for this assembly got out. Or... it was leaked to him. Tell me, Satoshi. Did you prepare that wheelchair? No, I didn't even notice it. So? What's your reason for opposing? No, it's just... If you don't want to, then leave. Right? It doesn't bother you? You want to die with that stranger? Aren't we strangers to you, too? Yeah, but that's different. I don't know. I suppose we need to talk. About what? This Flunitrazepam. Huh? Say what? It's a sleeping pill. Yes, but him... I think we should call him "No. 0." I don't think No. 0 died from these. Why not? Im-im-impossible. He'd v-v-vomit first before dying. He'd vomit all of the pills? Yes, you'd vomit before it took effect. He may have held back. No, it's not even a lethal amount. You wouldn't die from this. What then? It's a deception. Someone who doesn't know drugs killed No. 0... hoping to make it look like a suicide. That makes someone... a murderer. If the bodies of 13 minors were to be found here... it'll be front page news. But I left a note for the police. So they'll know we chose to take our own lives. They'll know No. 0 is an outsider. You mean that he was killed? I don't know. The police can be stupid. Exactly. If they don't discover the murderer... we could all be seen as suspects. Why? I didn't do it! Or we could all be viewed as victims. Killed like No. 0, but to look like a suicide. No one else knows of this assembly. So obviously one of you brought him! You'd better confess now. Because I'm not saying "Yes" until you do. You're against proceeding? - Yeah. - Reason? Don't! Do you have to smoke? You can do it on the 1st floor. That witch took out a policy on me. Her boyfriend put her up to it. "That witch" is your mom? A suicide gives her nothing. If I die within the first year. But she gets a big payout if my death is seen as murder. It has to be suicide for me! Sorry. I'm a little confused. But if you never die, she'll never get the money, either. They'll let me live for a year. But after that? My mom hangs outwith dudes who'd kill for pleasure. What an awful upbringing. We have a new dissenter among us, so let's keep talking. I need a smoke. I'll take you there. Can't tell the brand, but they're menthols. Menthols? Therefore? I saw butts from the same brand on the ground outside. They weren't there yesterday. You came with me to check if they were mine. It's not a hospital wheelchair. But neither is it the murderer's. No. 0 was confined to a wheelchair. You can tell by the way he's emaciated. But still... why doesn't he have shoes? He wouldn't need them. But he'd still wear them out. Even in a wheelchair, shoes still show you as a society member. What do you know about being in a wheelchair? I suppose I can't argue with that. I've been in treatment a long time. I know a little about sick people. Wait, I saw a shoe in the restroom. Just one. No. 0's? I don't know. But it was a boys' sneaker. Oh! I saw it, too! Restroom, right? In a flowerbed outside! A hat and a mask. Those aren't shoes. I saw them on the 2nd floor counter! Like Ryochin's! Ryochin? Just like hers! I only have what I'm wearing. And my name is Ryoko. B-b-but how'd he c-c-come by wheelchair? The elevators... Were stopped on the 6th floor jammed by chairs. We three saw that. So before that. The door to the reception area and vault is very narrow. Everything's looking suspicious. And the automatic doors at the front entrance were wide open. Strange. I shut off the power to the doors last night. The switch on the ceiling? Yes. I found a mop on the floor. Someone hit the switch. A wheelchair could enter from there. Yes but... I guess he couldn't pass through reception. So? Are we going to talk until we find the murderer? Unless someone confesses and takes this dude out. Why don't you two dissenters just quit, then? Why should I have to quit? It's not positively a murder. It's not? We need to get to the bottom of this. Will talking get to the bottom of this? You're right. Just talking won't get us anywhere. Let's leave this room momentarily. All of us walking around? If someone outside sees us, we're done here! Anri's right. All of us would be conspicuous and time-consuming. How's this? We divide into groups and investigate that way. "Flowerbed", "1 F Lobby", "1F Restroom", "6F Elevators" Sh-sh-shoe! Sure is. It w-w-wasn't here before. Different elevator? It was this one. I see. Then it was this one. G-g-girls' restroom, too. So here. We're just here for the chairs you saw. We're not taking detours. Th-th-these were the chairs. Wedged in the elevator doors? These were also in 1st floor reception. Big deal. They're pretty ordinary looking. Yes, that's very true. Where now? Do something.. Here! I saw these on the 2nd floor. Who tossed these and why? Do you want to die because of bullying or something? You're a tiny bit annoying. Sorry. You shouldn't talk. What? Why? Is it that obvious? Yeah, bingo. I knew it. How long have you been bullied? About 2 years. Longer if you count middle school. By classmates? Club mates? By the teacher at first. And it spread from there. Until it was out of control. Did you talk to your parents? They screamed at me for wanting to switch schools. I see. But sometimes guys like you who stick out can become popular. That never happens. Yes, it does. Right? What is it? The guys who harassed you... Want me to set them straight? If you hadn't dissented, that witch might have profited off me. Then help him out. A little late now that we're dying. You're right. But thanks. No way. It's too tight. But still he forced his way in here. Whoa. You're like a cop. Those are my parents. They're police officers, both of them. A wheelchair can't go through here. Wheel's busted, too. So then... he noticed the automatic doors. So this is your parents' influence? No, I've always liked this. Solving mysteries? For me, using my brain is my only diversion. What? I'm testing if No. 0 could come alone. I get it. You think he crawled from there. That settles it. He must've needed help to open these doors. No. 0 had a chaperone. Well done. A boy's shoe judging from the size. Definitely. May not be No. 0's shoe, though. No, no, no! This is different! Different? My cigs. Favorites of someone I loved. And so... before I go to him... you know? There's K-K-Kenichi... and Mai. What're they doing there? Someone must be sitting on a bench, hidden by the trees. M-maybe it's Seigo. Why'd we come here? It's meaningless. I j-j-just wondered... about something. I c-c-can't explain. Sorry. You don't have to apologize. I'm h-h-hard to listen to. But don't apologize. You stuttered more at first. Th-that can't be. I haven't taken my medicine. What medicine? Sl-sleeping pills, sedatives, and various others. For what sickness? H-how do you call it? My mother says... I would fall on the floor kicking and screaming. I did it a lot wh-when I was little. When you were little. Yeah, I put my mother through a lot of hardship. But she tried h-hard to cure me with all kinds of medicine. The problem is those drugs... kind of scramble the inside of my head. No kidding. It's the drugs! I believed if it would cure me someday... I could put up with it. But I've come to think now that I'll never be cured. What does your dad say? I was raised by just my mother. That's too bad. My father would've sent a mom like that packing. My m-mom loves me! There are a lot of bad women out there. My dad can spot them. Was your mom a bad woman? As were my second and third moms. Unredeemable. So my dad sent them all away. Serves them right. Wow. Pretty spacious up here. Your area's the 1st floor. We're being put together. This is a prime position. You can see everyone who enters. I know how you feel. I'll take one last look. We should return. Nobuo! What? You killed him, didn't you? Is that right? Yeah. I did it. Let's continue this downstairs... with everyone present. - Could we? - That's best. Look! Parking lot! Hide! - Who is it? - Construction worker. It's too soon for that. Nobuo? How long's he going to make us wait? He's very late. Think he quit. No way. How do you know? I just do. How did Takahiro know Nobu killed No. 0? Nobu? When I arrived, I first went up to the r-roof. When I came down to the 6th floor, Nobuo and Seigo were there. Yeah, you came down. So what? But Nobuo then said to me... "It's a nice roof. Spacious." I see. What? D-don't you think it strange? The elevators were stopped. Hey yeah! He'd been up there b-before me. S-so, who stopped them? Nobuo! Seigo, where'd you see him? 1st floor. I approached him, though. He told me the elevators were stopped. Even though he did it? He was sweating a lot. Yeah. Profusely. But why would he jam the elevators? So no one would go to the 6th floor. That's where No. 0 probably was. He was hiding the body? Hiding it where? Hospital store. A-a-and these sh-sh-shoes. They weren't in the elevator. Nobuo had it. Un-under his jacket. He c-c-covered it like this. He could! He stood behind us in the elevator, too. And dropped it then. It's conceivable. If Nobuo who killed No. 0 had the shoe... then it was 0's. I'm glad we found both. Great. We said we could proceed once this was settled. We haven't settled anything? We need to determine if Nobuo decided to quit or not. Let's make a time limit. If he doesn't return by then, we vote without him. 30 minutes. Anyone planning to say "No" must decide by then. Who made you boss? For those of us who want to proceed now, this is a big concession. "Arrival Order" Nobuo felt he had to hide No. 0... because this room was still locked. So when did the two of them arrive here? "Nobuo & 0" All your testimonies lead to this. S-something's strange. M-Mai was the 9th person to arrive. But o-only she found the mask and hat. Yeah, Meiko, Anri and Yuki should've seen them. I didn't see them. - Me, neither. - Me, neither. They were lying there in plain sight! If Mai had arrived last, there wouldn't be a problem. Tell me. Did you unlock this room, Satoshi? Yes. Then why were you the last to enter? I was checking the building just in case. Someone had switched on the lights. That was Nobuo, too! Obviously, since he snuck in before Satoshi. One more person came early. The butts by the bench outside? The ones you noticed upon arriving. Someone else smokes these. I didn't smoke on the bench. And mine's a different brand. Who was just in the smoking room? Ryochin, you? With a mask? She can take it off. If you mean the bench, yes, those were my butts. We have 3 minors who smoke here? That makes the true order like this. "2. Ryoko" I've no connection to Nobuo or No. 0. You just lied to us so why believe you? Because you're all scrutinizing arrival order. If you came before Satoshi... It was around 10 a.m. My life is very strictly supervised. That was my only window of escape. So you killed time on the bench, then entered from the back? After entering, I went to the smoking room. When I made my way to the vault, 3 numbers had already been taken. I saw Kenichi sitting in the lobby on the 2nd floor. So I ducked into the girls' restroom. And then... I heard that! I turned around but didn't see anyone. Shush! Ryoko's talking here. It's okay. He verifies Ryoko's story. I heard something fall in the hall. A sh-shoe? No. 0's shoe? A heavier sound. For example... someone falling over. A person? That's closer to what I heard. When I opened the door, I glimpsed someone running in the hall. Wearing black. It wasn't me. I'm not even sure it was black. That's confusing. We all had on black of some kind. Not this guy. E-even his inside shirt was bright colored. That's everything. What else can I tell you? More. Why hide your face? She's free to do that. It's just become a habit. Sure it is. I'll show my face if you want. You don't have to. I mean, you've got burn marks or something? Then show us. - Don't listen to him. - It's okay. Riko? I'm Ryoko. No, no. You're Riko! You're identical! Don't be stupid. It's her! Seriously? Wh-wh-what are you d-d-doing here with us? I'm no different than you all. For me to be true to myself... I need to bury forever this false person named "Riko". You can't! If you die, a lot of people will follow you! You'll only make more like me! Don't tell me... the person you said you loved was a celebrity. You give hope to lot of people like me. A reason to live! Stop it! You're not ordinary like us! You're chosen! I'm a fake! A product people spent time and money creating! If you sacrifice your life to that, you're an idiot! Why would you say that? 30 minutes have long passed. Take a vote. Yes, please. Right away. Okay. Are there any dissenters? Of course there are! I'm not going to agree until Riko steps away. I told you the truth. So deal with it. Can we at least make the preparations to move things along? Any opposed to even that? "Fire alarm", "Weather strip tape", "Briquettes", "Stepladder" "Dialysis Room" I totally remember him. In a band, right? He hung himself. I envy people who can love another that much. All I've ever felt towards others is hate and disappointment. Here it is! Hold this. There's another box. I'm sorry. I can't grip well with this hand. I didn't know. Sorry. Sorry. I'll do that. Celebrities must have incredible power. I mean, people will follow them in death. How must it feel to be that adored? You mean his feelings? Yeah. "Fire alarm" Our job's done. I should thank you. For joining the assembly. What do you mean? Thanks to you... what I want to say will get wider attention. What do you want to say? That life presents a big choice. I want people to face that choice more honestly. That's a world I long to see. I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying my dying with you will spread that message to many? That is correct. I've been surrounded all my life by people who sought to use me. I refuse to be used in death, too. You can protest if you wish. But that'll be the result. "Briquettes" Okay, let's go. Sorry. Can I rest a moment? Of course. Take your time. You're sick, right? I'm doing pretty good today. Yeah. Me, too. What? You're sick, too? Something like that. Infected by a man I met online. The old guy forced his tongue on me. Disgusting. I don't get why you would take out a policy on yourself. It's not the same as what your mom did. In my case, a year has already passed, so even suicide pays. Your dad? His firm's going under, so he'll be glad to receive it. Did he ask you to die for his company? No way! I'm doing this for myself. So that he'll never forget me. People will say that my step mom and dad were saved... by their daughter's death. Kept alive by his dead daughter! That's so stupid. Not getting in? I'm looking for Nobuo. Don't deviate from the plan! There's no guarantee, you know... that dying will keep your memory alive. Parents are nothing special. Same goes for you. Your suicide doesn't guarantee trouble for your mom. They might treat it as just a miscalculation. Maybe he tripped and fell down the stairs. Wouldn't he come here for first aid? There's a trail of blood to the 3rd floor restroom where he treated himself. Nobuo had a partner. Maybe it was to silence him. So you think he was pushed? What's so odd? Explain it to our satisfaction. Regardless of whether he was pushed... it seems likely that Nobuo had a partner. If that's true... it would explain his jamming the elevators after moving No. 0. His partner was still on the roof. The roof? Thanks for your help. We can proceed now at any time. Why didn't you seal the door? So we'd have oxygen for our talks. Isn't that obvious? Did you get all this equipment yourself, Satoshi? Yes. You carried in the beds, too? It wasn't especially difficult. My father used to run this hospital. I know where everything is. This was your hospital? But it's being shut down, right? Did your father quit? If you mean as a hospital manager, then yes. He committed suicide, so you could call that quitting. Why'd he kill himself? Why're you killing yourself? He suffered from a long depression... brought on by my mother and brother's attempted suicides. Which was due to my brother failing med school. Their lives were saved, but they were separated to other relatives. That left my dad alone with me. And he chose suicide? Yes. Must've been awful for you. I dealt with it. Is that what gave you the idea for this assembly? Yes. Death had infected so many around me in a short time... that it has become sort of an obsession with me. What does it mean to want to die? I need to know. Someone here... doesn't just want to die. But wants to commit murder. What Yuki-chin? As things now stand, I don't think anything will be settled. So please... let's get on with it. I beg you. I have side effects... from a traffic accident. Her left hand... The suffering's gone on long enough. It's time to be set free. That's why I came. But now... even this... Hey, what're you doing? Sealing this door. I told you. Let's finish while we still have air. Instead of stalling. Acting childish will only complicate things more. This is all your doing, Anri. What? You've acted weird from the start... questioning me if I belonged here. What's wrong with making sure? You made me open the safe. Because I opened the door. Yes, like you'd been here many times. You've suddenly started to think about what to say. I'm remembering your suspicious behavior. Maybe you pushed Nobuo down the stairs. Fine, seal the door. No oxygen beats listening to you. All right. I will, then. No, wait! Why don't you close it? What did you see? Open up. It's me... Nobuo. - N-Nobuo? - Open it! - Meiko! - Move! Nobuo. If you had just let me in, you could've saved your cover. Thank you... for pushing me. Shouldn't you lie down? No, I don't have that right anymore. What do you mean? You thought with Nobuo gone, we could proceed? Isn't that the s-same thing your father did? Why my father? Getting rid of people who are an inconvenience. Your father eventually wanted to get rid of you. That's why you're here. You don't know anything. So shut up about it! I'm not angry with you, Meiko. It's karma, actually. I murdered someone. No, I don't mean him over there. It wasn't you, then? No, it wasn't. But a year ago, I killed a schoolmate. By accident? No, I intended to do it. I was being bullied pretty badly. He was their leader. Same as me. I could see it with Kenichi. Don't be mean. Anyway... I never had trouble excelling at things. It rubbed people wrong. But that bad person is no longer around. Why are you here, Nobuo? Nobody found out. It was deemed an accident. The bullying ended. But... that's when hell began. I wanted so badly to confess. It was eating me up inside. You said you lost the right to be here. You're quitting? I used the same method as Meiko. I pushed him. I felt what it was like for him. I was being paid back. So I meant it when I said "Thank you." A weight lifted in me. I can die anytime now. On my own. But before that, I needed... to make a confession. Too bad. Can I stay a bit longer? I've come this far. I'd like to see the whole picture. Don't you already know everything? What? You're arrestingly pretty. Nobu here hasn't seen her. Nobu? Answer the question. Oh, sorry. I don't know everything. Meaning? You can blame everything on me, but that doesn't solve the mystery. Therefore... it's up to you. Who, me? I think you can fill in the gaps. You won't speak any further... out of consideration to Anri. What is he to Anri? She's his partner. It was Anri. It all began... on the roof. I think they met there before anyone else had arrived. Oh, someone earlier than me. 2/12ths of the group. Are you counting participants? I want to make sure no one comes to obstruct us. Me, too. We've come too far to be stopped now. Someone appeared, pushing No. 0. A participant? Maybe someone sick as well? Could be. Going to help? When they got to the 1st floor, the assistant was gone. Not breathing. I'll go after the other one. It's no use. He fled. Maybe inside? Possibly. Or he's long gone by now. escaped? They couldn't jeopardize the mission. So they decided to hide the body. Where're you going? Anri turned on the power for the elevators. And maybe she wanted Satoshi away from the assembly room. Anri returned to the roof to await the rest of us. One person soon arrived, making the girls' restroom risky. I can't move him. The wheel's broken. Then when he tried dragging No. 0... one of his sneakers fell off. He put him in a chair with wheels from reception. And that's when the other sneaker came off. He went to the 2nd floor to hide the body. I think the hat and mask was worn by the assistant who brought No. 0. In other words, that person was still in the building. "An arrival, 2nd floor lobby" "Go to 6th floor store" Nobuo must've picked up the hat and mask, too. Then Anri told Nobuo to take No. 0 up to the 6th floor. The sound Kenichi and Ryoko heard was No. 0 falling from the chair. Nobuo went to the 6th floor store as instructed. That's when their plan took shape. To pose No. 0 as a participant who'd gone ahead. It's 11 a.m. Go to the assembly room. To keep people from the 6th floor... Nobuo jammed the elevators with 2 chairs. The only issue now was how to sneak No. 0 into the assembly room. Seeing the power on, Satoshi started his patrol. That allowed Nobuo to enter the assembly room alone. 12 beds are lined up here. He brought one of the beds up to transport No. 0. Nobuo spent a lot of energy going up and down. The last one is here. Wait. 13th person? It must be an outsider. Then where's the 12th? I lost her. Maybe she entered. Anri got flustered. She had to see if Meiko was an outsider. But couldn't draw suspicion by using the back exit. She needed to pretend she, too, had just arrived. The front entrance was the only way. But someone was there. He used the vending machine to lure me away. That allowed Anri to go out the front door unnoticed. Here for the assembly? The entrance should be there. Once all were believed to be inside, Anri disposed of the hat and mask. But Mai was still outside. So she was the only one to see the hat and mask. Those two did all of that? With all of us here? Ryoko wasn't the only one to lie about arrival order. Nobuo and Anri assumed that No. 0 was one of the 12. That prompted Anri to confirm if Meiko belonged here. What did I tell you? My story helped you. You questioned me if I belonged here. More than that... if Nobuo had a partner... the two would've already exchanged contact info. If so... the partner knew Nobuo had been pushed down the stairs. The person who pushed him wouldn't want Nobuo to return. And would press for closing the assembly room door. It confirmed Meiko's guilt to the partner. She texted Nobuo to come. And waited here for him. Yeah, you just stood there. You knew Nobuo was there, but urged me to shut the door. That's pretty low, no matter what. What's the problem? We came here to die, right? He would've kept us talking, delaying our purpose. I did it for you. I did it for all of you! If I knew someone like you was amongst us... I might have done a better job. Are you saying that my deductions are correct? Are you satisfied? There's nothing preventing us now from proceeding. Thanks for waiting. Seal the door. Wait, not yet! So who is No. 0? Did he just make that noise? A snore? A burp? He made that! He's alive! - But he was so dead! - Quiet! It's very faint, but he's breathing. And his pulse? He has one. It, too, is very faint. Could be the drugs. No way. So he was just asleep? Thank God. Wait, wait! Can we proceed with this with him here? If we do, we'll really be murderers. Just put him outside. W-what, again? No one will come to help him. There's a chance. We'll call an ambulance. Are you serious? - I'll take him. - Where? Where he'll be found. Unlock the door. You'll be seen! I'll make sure I'm not. There must be another way! Yeah, let's think it over! Did the two of you know? That he's alive? We wouldn't fake his suicide if we did. It's exactly what you'd do! You're crazy. No, you two are crazy! Stop! Anri and Nobuo had no idea he was alive. But they brought him here. Yeah. If we're going to understand... we'll need your confession, too. Isn't it time? We hoped to arrive before everyone and be asleep from pills. The reception door was too narrow for the wheelchair. I couldn't get it through. I thought we could enter from the front as it was wider. But the automatic door switch wasn't working. Just then... It's stuck. He has the right. But he's already dead! He mustn't have made it in time. Or couldn't wait. Let's put him out. He intended to be a part of this. Why else would he come? So now what? He joins the process. He's one of us after all. I was having my doubts... I'd brought him here unconscious. But I didn't really know if he would've wanted this. About ending both our lives here. Maybe this was just my own conviction, not his. But... when I saw how Anri and Nobuo had accepted him... then I began to feel his approval for what I was doing. My brother wished to sleep here. Your brother... He was also in the accident with you? On the way home... my brother gave me a ride. He had on his girlfriend's scarf. I was tugging on it jokingly. And then... A car appeared. I turned him into a vegetable! But... I couldn't tell anyone. That's when you found Satoshi's site. With only one space left. But I had to. It's time to be set free. So I brought him. You've said those words before. When you first said so... I sensed you weren't talking about yourself. "It's time to be set free." Those are words of an observer. Not of the sufferer. You know that everyone is trying their best to keep you alive. So you stay quiet. But... is it really your fault? Everyone fools around like that. It was just... an unlucky coincidence. We could say that for everyone here. Like the day my disease appeared. Some bad luck was passing by... and I rode into it. You're pretty darn perceptive. I could be wrong. You're not. My disease is the same. What's wrong with you? Herpes. Herpes? You mean like... on your mouth? Yeah, that. You want to die because of that? From that? It's incurable, you know! That may be so, but... What, are you saying your condition's different from mine? What's so funny? Nothing. Sorry. There's no difference. Right? Right. We've all struggled in the same way. I came here to reject my existence. That's what killing yourself is. It's a protest against being born. I don't know... Could you be a little clearer? I-I had no other choice. Except to protest, right? Fine, make it a protest, but go do it alone. Alone? Then why participant in this at all? Our deaths... will deliver a big message to society. Sorry, I'm lost. Me, too. I'm not so sure this will... serve as the protest message you expect. Don't worry. It's all in the note I left. We all reached the same conclusion. Our lives hold no value. We shouldn't have been born! Not me. I'm here because I believed my life DID have value. My mom might see my life as the price of an insurance payout. But I don't see it like that. I for one am glad I was born to meet him. I had a little brother. He died in a fire before he was one. I was four years old. When I came to... everything was in flames. Then the ceiling fell. I heard my brother crying... until I passed out. He was fighting to survive. My mom would often leave home for days. But she came home that day. We were already asleep. She smoked some cigarettes... and went out again. So why was my brother even born? And my mom? Who gave her the right to cause such pain? Someone has to stop this. There can't be any more children like us. So it's up to us... to defy these selfish adults for creating meaningless life! We shouldn't have been born! I empathize with your story, and anger. You don't have to! But if you want a clear message... why not show them that you can live despite them? You think I haven't thought that? Then think more! This is my conclusion! I felt the same! That this was the only answer. A month from now... maybe a year, I don't know... I'll lose the ability to make decisions. So before that happens... I at least want to make my own decision to end my life. But that decision... could just as easily be to live. Meeting you all... has helped me come to that realization. I'm making the decision... to keep living until death comes. When we learned Yuki's brother was alive... we all wanted to save him first. That was my feeling, too. But that feeling wasn't directed just at him. But at all of us. I suddenly wanted everyone here to live. Are you done now? No, I'm not. I want to hear more of your... and all of your... stories. Satoshi. Yes? I have a proposal. Could you take a vote on it? What proposal? A proposal to cancel this assembly. Raise your hands if you're in favor of Shinjiro's proposal. Well then it's unanimous. This assembly is hereby canceled. Still hanging around? You've done this many times before, haven't you? How many? Three times. How'd you guess that? That last vote. You said it was unanimous. But you never raised your own hand. Your never raising it means... you never planned to die. That's not true. Is that all? There's more. You had us all talk to each other. You bring suicidal people together, and send them home alive. That's not my intention. It's just the way it always ends. Is it always this troublesome? No, today was the most extreme. I was prepared to go ahead with it. And if we'd all said, "Yes"? Then I'd join you in your sleep. Without stopping us? I'm still obsessed with death. But when it's canceled and everybody has gone home... I get a very good feeling. When's next? I promise to take part. With a sponsor expecting cancellation... you need a participant who wants to succeed. Yeah. I'd welcome that. See you later then, Satoshi.
