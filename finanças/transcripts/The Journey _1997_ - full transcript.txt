(soft Indian music) - [Voiceover] Fasten your seat belt, please. (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Raj] Laura? - Hi, where are you? - [Raj] You still there? - What do you mean, I'm still here? Where else would I be? - [Raj] I left a message. I can't go to the airport. I'm sorry, but you'll have to pick up Dad. - Oh no. Oh my God, Raj, how am I gonna get to the airport in 20 minutes? And how's this gonna look if you don't pick him up? - [Raj] Just explain to him, I've got an emergency here. A patient in critical condition, what can I do? - All right, I'll leave right now. Jen, hurry. (playful flute music) - Excuse me, are you my grandpa? (speaks in a foreign language) - Hello, Mr. Singh. Jenny, say hello to your grandpa. - How is my (foreign language)? Hello. Raj didn't come? - No, he's in surgery. One of his patients, last minute emergency. I'm so sorry we're late. - That's okay. - So, can I help you with your luggage, Mr. Singh? - I'll take it. No formalities, please call me Dad. - Okay, I'll take these, then. - [Kishan] Thank you. - [Jenny] Mary Lou is my best friend. Also, Herman, he has a snake. And he keeps it in is pocket. - [Kishan] Oh my god (chuckles). - Herman says there's no Santa Claus. - I see Jenny's recruited an audience. - [Kishan] Thank you. - You're welcome. - [Laura] No, Mr. Singh, you're supposed to put the whole bag in. - [Kishan] Oh. - Here, you can have mine. - [Kishan] Thank you. - Sure. Well, you must be quite tired. - I managed to sleep a little on the plane, but it was difficult. - I know, I can never rest properly on planes. - Your mother's all right? - Yes, thank you. She's in Santa Fe. - Is that far? - Oh, yes. Raj and I wanted to go to India for Mrs. Singh's funeral, but we just couldn't get away. - Thank you for your letter, that was very kind. - You're welcome. - Mommy says smoking is a dirty habit. - Jenny. That's not a nice thing to say. - Your mommy is right. - Then why do you smoke? - Jenny. I'm so sorry. - No, no, no, please, (laughs) it's all right. (soft car engine) (door closes) - [Raj] Dad. Sorry, I couldn't come to the airport. (speaks in a foreign language) - We had an emergency at the hospital. - Doesn't matter, work has to be done. - Why didn't you serve tea? - I did. - I had tea, I'm fine. - Oh, good. What is it? - [Kishan] That is a turban hanger from Gunjas. - A turban hanger? Wow, it's beautiful. Is it antique? - I don't know, it looks old. - [Raj] So, how are things back home? - All right, Maarsoon is getting married, which is good. Summer is too hot. Maybe it bothers me more because I'm getting old. - In India, I always liked walking in the rain. Here the rain is always too cold. - How is Uncle Shobhan? - He passed away, didn't I write? His time had come, doctors could do no more. - Yes, unfortunately medicine is not an exact science. - When your time comes, it's best to forget about doctors and go with dignity. Your mother knew when her time had come. She refused all medicine, and insisted on coming home. This was your mother's. You give this to Laura. - I remember how Mother always wanted to hug and kiss me, and I never let her. Dad, when was the last time you had a medical checkup? - I am fine. I'll still beat you at badminton. - There's some fresh towels in the bathroom. And a nightlight if you have to get up. - What time does the water come to the bathroom. - This is America, Dad. You have water any time you like. Hot and cold. Goodnight. - [Kishan] Goodnight. (soft playful Indian flute music) - Hi, silk, nice. - Yeah, Dad gave it to me. And he gave this. And he bought those. - Beautiful. - Aren't you late? - Yes. I was restoring your father's bathroom. - What's wrong? - Nothing, he's used to having servants. That's all. - It'll be okay. I'll take care of it. Anyway, he won't be here for that long. - It's fine. - You press this to change channels. And this turns it off. That's for the CD player. - If I want music, this one. And TV, this one. - Yeah. And this? - I don't know. - Let's go, Jen. - Mr. Singh, did you sleep well? - Not too well. - Well, it takes a few days. So, can you operate all those now? - Yes, I'll be fine, don't worry. - Good, let me show you the food. - Raj showed me, thanks. I'll be all right. - Okay, c'mon, Jen. - Bye bye. - [Voiceover] (beep) Hello, University of Pittsburgh. Yeah, please hold, I'll connect you. (beep) Hello, University of Pittsburgh, oh hi. - It takes a village. A whole village. - Did you wanna say something? - So, we're going ahead with this fundraising project after all? I don't know, I don't know. - Well, it's a little late to discuss this. - I mean, I think you should be concentrating on finishing your book. - But we have to take a stand on this. - Laura, you have to publish by the end of the year. You've just finished telling me that you're going to have even less time now with your father-in-law at home. - I know, but Michael, if not us then who's gonna do it? - But why must it always be you tackling every damn bleeding heart cause? - Because I can't help it, that's why. Because one has to make a statement sometime. Else, why live? And yes, it does take a whole bloody village. - Like it when you're like that. (Indian drumming music) - [Voiceover] Women smarter than men at handling their bosses. - [Voiceover] More useful news for inquiring minds. - [Voiceover] Changing your hairstyle to give you the-- (loud rock music) (Indian drumming) (piano music) (soft Indian music) (sighs) - Oh, oh. (vacuum) (doorbell rings) (glass shatters) - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. - Do you know the way to salvation? - Are you saying, that if one does not know Jesus Christ, one cannot-- - One cannot enter the kingdom of God. - Even if one spends a lifetime doing good deeds, one will still go to hell? - All men are sinners. And all men must answer to Christ our Lord. You must accept Christ as your-- Hello. - Hello. Goodbye, thank you. - Very sorry, was this expensive? - Oh, no, no, no, don't worry about it. I hope he didn't bother you too much. - Not at all. - You didn't give him any money, did you? - No. - Good. - Actually, it's very nice to see young people interested in spiritual matters. - Mr. Singh, perhaps we shouldn't let strangers in the house, you never know. (Kishan speaks in a foreign language.) - [Laura] Okay. (soft chatter) - Here Dad, have some more wine. - Thank you. - Stop, stop, stop. Thank you. To have every meal blessed with good wine, DeGault. - No, actually that's Walt Whitman. - (speaks in a foreign language) Well, that's equally good. (Jenny speaks in a foreign language) (laughter) - Jenny, don't play with your food. - Laura's learned well. I have not had such a delicious meal since your mother passed away. - Actually, Dad, I cooked it. - You? My son the doctor can cook? This is wonderful. - Daddy, I can count to ten in Hindi. Grandpa taught me. - Well, aren't you smart, let's hear it. - No. - Oh. So, Dad, what would you like to do while you're here? - I just came to see you. Relax, enjoy my retirement. - Can we take you anywhere? - New York, or Washington? - No, no, no. I have a friend here, Ashok, I have his address. I'd like to meet him. He has a Indian music program on the radio. - Right. - And there's one other thing. It's been my dream to visit Fallingwater. - Oh, Fallingwater. - Oh, the Frank Lloyd Wright house. It's beautiful. - Well, actually that isn't in Pittsburgh. It's a bit of a drive, about, what two hours? - One and a half, two. - Well, if we've got time, we'll take you, Dad. (Kishan burps loudly) (Jenny giggles) - I'll have tea now. Do you have paan? - Sorry, Dad you can't get paan here. - What's paan? - It isn't for kids. - (speaks in a foreign language) I'll have tea, then. - I'll just get some. - Sit, I'll get it. (gargles) - Jenny Singh, don't you dare. (laughter) - Hello. - [Laura] Hi. Hey. Mr. Singh, this is my friend, Audrey. (Kishan speaks in foreign language) - Good news, the gallery will provide everything, hors d'oeuvres, cheap white wine, chocolate. - Fantastic, how did you manage this? - I gave 'em a choice. You can help us out, or I'll walk. Nothing like a good old fashioned blackmail. - You are tough. - Oh god, you're talking about the fundraiser. - Don't tell me. - I'm sorry. - You forgot. - It'll be all right. - You promised me. - And we're counting on your rich friends to attend, you got it? - It'll be all right. I have to attend a staff meeting, but I'll be there. I'll be there. - You can't be Raj's father, you look too young. - (laughs) Oh, I don't know. How old are you? - Too old. I'm decaying fast. (Kishan speaks in foreign language) - What is your husband doing? - She isn't married, Mr. Singh. - Why not? Don't you want children? - I don't want to make any irreversible mistakes in my life. - (speaks in a foreign language) Still, don't you miss the babble of children's voices in the house? - When that happens, I usually go and buy another TV. (laughter) No, I'm too busy with my work, I suppose. - Dad, those are Audrey's paintings in the dinning room. - Really, what a gift. - Every Indian home has one painting. They receive it as a wedding present. - [Laura And Raj] And it hangs crooked and undusted forever. (laughter) - So have you been around town? We have a beautiful museum, you know. - Not yet, but now I have a map. I'll catch a trolley. - You know what, I'm free Saturday. What do you say I come by and show you the sights. - Oh, I. - Oh, come on, it's no problem at all. And you can give these two a break. So, it's settled. It's okay, with you? - [Raj] Sure. - [Laura] Yeah. - [Audrey] Good. (Kishan sings in a foreign language) - Morning, Dad. - Morning. (speaks in a foreign language) All yours. (Kishan sings in a foreign language) (Indian music) (Indian music) (knock on door) - [Ashok] Yes? - Kishan? Kishan, (speaks in a foreign language). What the hell are you doing here? (Ashok speaks in a foreign language) - Thank you. - Sit. - This is my son, Raj, he's a doctor. (Kishan speaks in foreign language) (Ashok speaks in a foreign language) - So, does it work? - Does what work? - The poetry, I see you're still using it to charm women. (laughter) - (speaks in a foreign language) Who would want, a short, old ugly man like me? - Oh, don't talk like that, you're not that short. You're still young. - What about ugly? (laughter) - Oh, she passed away. - [Ashok] No. - A few months ago. - I am sorry, I am sorry. What about your wife? - She's busy tonight. - Laura's American. - [Ashok] I see. The president gave you an award, or something? - It's nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? You have been a headmaster of a school for 30 years. You deserve some credit. - Oh, that's kind. - So, my friend, tell me, how is life? - (speaks in a foreign language) Love it. (Jenny laughs) - [Kishan] You're too fast. (video game noises) Wait. - What's going on? - Oh, we're shooting down foreigners. (Jenny shrieks happily) (video game noises) (doorbell) - [Kishan] Wait, wait, wait, wait for me, wait for me. (doorbell) - Hi, you must be Mrs. Minsky. - How are you? - Fine, come in, thank you. You're just in time, let me show you around. (Kishan speaks in foreign language) - She's a babysitter. - It's all right, Dad, you rest. You've got jetlag. She'll take care of Jenny. - Jenny's bedtime is 8:30. - Oh, Mom. - Come here, be good now, okay? Goodbye. You have both of our numbers? - Hm. - Remember your promise. - I can't, I've got to work. Goodnight, Jenny. - [Jenny] Goodnight. - Dad, goodnight. - Goodnight. (kids playing) (soft classical music) - You tell them they can (speaks in a foreign language). Tell them that I don't care. (woman screaming on TV) You tell them I don't want that. (speaks in foreign language) you tell them to go to hell, too. Just a second, I said just a second. You want something? - I want you to leave, right now, please. (classical music) (Indian music) Mmm, mmm, good. (classical music) (phone rings) - Hello, hello, your good name, please. - [Laura] Laura. - Laura is not here. Your qualifications, please. - This is Laura, Mr. Singh. Is Jenny all right? - Jenny can't come to the phone. She's eating a mango. - Let me talk to the babysitter, please. - She's gone, I'm here. - Gone, what happened? - She had to go, she was no good. - Did Raj call? - The day of Rama and Sita's return has been celebrated all over India as Diwali. Do you know Diwali? Festival of lights. - Read one more. I don't hear stories much. - Your mommy and daddy don't read to you? (speaks in a foreign language) - No, they're very busy. - Then I'll read to you, every night. - But, Grandpa, you'll go away. - I want to show you something. She was your grandmother. Your daddy's mother. - She's pretty. - Pretty, yeah. (soft Indian music) (soft classical music) - [Michael] I guess we're not very popular. - I have this fantasy. - Oh, I think I like this. - Don't you sometimes feel like running away and hiding? I could work in some fast food place. - Yeah, but you'd get fat. Your skin'd break out. - True, then who would love me. - I would. - Let's close up. - Sorry I'm late. I came as soon as I could. Is there anything I can do? (horn honks) - Yes. Have a good time. - I'm going now. - Hmm. (car door dings) - Namaste. - Namaste, seat belt. - Beg your pardon? - Seat belt. - Oh. - There you go. - Thank you. (Indian music) - [Audrey] So, I was thinking, before we go to the museum. - You know, I really like it here. No heat, no dust, no crowds, no queues anywhere. And the food shops. - Supermarkets. - Supermarkets. So much food? - The food has chemicals. - Water 24 hours a day? - Water also has chemicals. - 50 television stations. - (laughs) Mostly garbage. - People are so friendly. - Americans have this habit of smiling foolishly at everybody. Means nothing. - (speaks in a foreign language) It's wonderful here. Admit it. I don't see why you can't be happy. - Happy, what is happy? One is born, one dies. But in between, you go to the bathroom a lot. (laughter) - I see. Still the poet. - [Ashok] You must be having a good time with your granddaughter. What's her name? - Jennifer. Yes, it's good to be with family. What is the problem here? - Uh-oh, hey. (Ashok speaks in a foreign language.) - Things are not right between Raj and his wife. They go off to work everyday. The child is being raised by strangers, babysitters. - Are you gonna do something about it? Or are you waiting for divine interference? - Intervention, you mean. - You know, Kishan, I have noticed that, by and large, these love marriages with American women don't really work out. They're far too demanding. - Laura is a very good girl, very intelligent. - Now you agree that a wife must serve her husband. I have a perfect marriage. My wife, Sneha, comes from India in (speaks in a foreign language). I tell her what to do, she does it, and we're both happy. - I've been thinking, maybe I should stay. Help my family, especially. - Jennifer. I think you should. Yes, what's there to go back to India for? Besides, far too much botheration, yeah. - Yeah, there's one thing I miss in America. - Really? - I miss paan. - No. (laughter) - (clears throat) I know you're not very smart. Why are you still smoking? Non-smoking is very popular in America. You know the reason why? - [Kishan] Why? - Americans want to be healthy when they die. (laughter) - I see, yes, we smokers are a dying breed. (laughter) - No. - No, no. - Ashok, no, absolutely I insist. - Never. (Ashok and Kishan argue in foreign language) - Please don't, just a minute. (Indian music) - Okay. Right here, there. Now, eyes shut, very good. (laughter) (Kishan speaks in a foreign language) (Raj speaks in a foreign language) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] Air India, good morning, how may I help you? - Good morning, sir, I'm fine, how are you? - [Voiceover] I'm fine, thank you, and how may I help you today? - You see, the situation is-- - [Voiceover] Your name please, sir. - My name is Kishan Singh, S-i-n-g-h. - [Voiceover] Your reservation number? - I'm booked on double one two one 20th. You see. - [Voiceover] Yes, I see, you have a return-- - Yes, I mean no, I want to cancel it. - [Voiceover] That's just fine. Would you like a new reservation? - Right now I have no return plan. I've decided to stay. - [Voiceover] Well, thank you for calling Air India, and please call us when you have a return need. - I will. - [Voiceover] Have a nice day. - I will have a nice day, thank you. Jenny. Jenny. Jenny. Jenny, yoo-hoo. (loud Indian music) Did you like this? - It sounded like someone was drowning. I haven't heard it in years. I don't have any time. - (speaks in foreign language) There's always time for music. - Not in my life, Dad. - (speaks in a foreign language) You're not teaching Jenny Hindi? - No, there's no opportunity for that here. And besides, there's no use for Indian language here. - Well, she should learn about her culture. - You see us, Dad, there's hardly any time. Life's so busy. - (Kishan speaks in foreign language) Why do you send your wife to work? She should be at home looking after the child. - I don't send her to work, she likes to work. - But, why do you permit it? - It's not for me to permit, Dad. It's her choice. - Listen to this. (loud Indian music) (music stops) (record player ticks softly) (children playing) - At least he's keeping the bathroom clean. It's not a good time to have guests. - Don't you think you're being a little unreasonable? - Unreasonable? Why does he always order me around? - He doesn't know better. He's used to people putting things for him. - Well, he could help out a little more. - It's his generation, Laura. Men don't cook. Men don't just bring things food. It's just not done. I'm not saying he's right, that's just how he is. - So, are you telling me I have to be his maid, now? - Oh, please. You could make a little more effort. You won't even call him, dad. How do you think that makes him feel? - Oh, look who's talking. All he wanted to do was go to Fallingwater, but I don't see you going out of your way to take him there. - You know it's a long trip. I haven't had time. - Yeah, well, now that he'll be here forever, I'm sure you'll find the time. - I know, I know what you're really upset about. His staying on. Well, what can I do? - Talk to him. Just talk to him. - I won't ask my father to leave. - You know I have to get published, Raj. I was gonna take the next two months to finish my book. Now, how can I do that with your father here? - [Raj] But, when did I stop you? Meanwhile, you gotta get involved with that fundraiser. - [Laura] The fundraiser would have been fine if you had done what you promised to do. - [Raj] Look, I already apologized for that. I am sorry, and I am sorry! - He drew out the arrow from his body, and nursed his wound. You don't like the story? What's the matter? - Mommy and Daddy were fighting because of you. - Why? - Because you want to go to Fallingwater. But, they're busy. Daddy was yelling. - Don't worry. It'll be all right. - Did you need something, Michael? - Are you sure you're all right? - Yes, I'm great. Why should anything be wrong with me? - You're not still depressed about that fundraiser? - No. It appears we have a permanent addition to the family. - Oh god, I didn't know. Congratulations. When are you due? - No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not pregnant. No, god. No, I'm talking about Raj's father. - Oh. - Yeah, he's moving in permanently. - You're kidding. And what does the good doctor think about this? - He's the only son. I mean, I knew this might happen when we got married. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think it's a wonderful, kind, thing to do to take in your parents. I've always admire that. - So, you're okay with this? - Mr. Singh. Is a well meaning person and Jenny's really taken to him. I just wish I'd been consulted. That's all. Sorry. - So, are you still waking up to dueling sitars? - No, thank you, I've taken care of that problem. (Indian music) (speaks in a foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) - I didn't know that you came to the temple. Did you have a chance to look at the package I sent to you? - It's on my desk. - No problem. It's just that we should move on it a little bit quickly. It's, you know, it's much better than putting your money in mutual funds. I'm not saying it's not risky. (bell chimes) I'll be completely honest with you, but, the chef studied in Paris, some blue or something. And the location it's excellent. You know what they say in the restaurant business, location is everything. I just thought once involved in this some what-- (Indian music) - One ticket, Fallingwater. - What water? - How do I go to house of Fallingwater? - I don't know nothing about no house of Fallingwater. I do know house of pancakes, though. (laughs) Hey buddy, make up your mind. You're holding up the line. (laughs) house of pancakes. - Hey, brother, you need some help? - Hello sir. - Are you okay? - That man, he's very dismissive. I only asked how to go to a Frank Lloyd Wright house. - Where are you from? - India. I am visiting. My son's a doctor - Is that right? - Yeah. - You must like it here, plenty to eat, huh? Well, you know, all those starving people in the streets over there. - Oh, no, no, no, sir. India's been a food exporting country for many, many years. - Well, Hallelujah, Hanukkah, Elvis is finally in his grave. - What? - Oh, well, never mind. - So, who's house did you wanna go to? - Fallingwater, it's a museum. - Oh sure, oh sure, well, I can take you there. - Okay. - But it's gonna cost you some bread. - Bread? Oh, dollars. I have dollars. If a man can't spend money to improve his life, or the lives of others, then you're a poor man indeed. - Thank you. - Go on, up there, right over there, go. - [Kishan] Bye bye. (Indian music) (cars speed on the freeway) (singing in a foreign language) (motorcycles hum) - [Audrey] (laughs) So, let me get this straight. He took your money and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere? - (laughs) Yes. - He showed Dad the scenic route. - I guess so. - It seems what you desire most in life is ultimately your undoing. - You should have told me you wanted to go to Fallingwater. I'll take you. - We're planning a trip. We're going this Saturday. - Oh, I can't, I'm going to New York this weekend. - It's all right. - Sorry, I've got to make a call. - Oh, Laura, I almost forgot. Thanks for lending me this. - Oh, sure. - Rilke, you like him? - Very profound. - My favorite is, the Ancient Torso of Apollo. - I must have missed that one. - That ends with that startling line. (Laura speaks in a foreign language) - Yes, yes. "You must change your life." I also like Autumn Day. "Whoever has no house now will never have one "Whoever is alone will stay alone "Will sit, read, take long walks in the boulevards, "While the dry leaves are blowing." - You quote so beautifully. Is this an Indian thing? - Well, in India, they think an educated man should be able to quote poetry. - In America, real men drink beer and watch football. (laughter) - Hey you know, until recently, San Francisco used to require a permit to hold a poetry reading in public. - No. - Yes. - Really? - She should know, she's a poet. - Laura, you write poetry? - Yes. Well, I mean, no, it's been a long time since I've written anything new. - Why don't you write? - Well, life gets in the way of art. - You know. I'd like to see you paint sometime. - Oh, Mr. Singh, Audrey doesn't like anyone watching her paint. - No? (Indian music) - [Kishan] I must tell you, I'm often at a loss when I see an abstract painting. - [Audrey] What's to worry? - [Kishan} I mean what do you say if you have to talk about it? - [Audrey] That's easy. If you like the painting, you just say it's beautiful. If you don't like it, just say, lots of energy. - [Kishan] Lots of energy. - [Audrey] (laughs) Right, lots of energy. (Indian music) - You didn't bring your wife? - She's gone to a movie with some friends. - Ah. - She loves these foreign films where you read the dialogue, you know the ones I mean? Where people sit around, smoke, and speak in French for two hours. (laughter) Look, I wanted to join the art field, too. - You? - Why? - Because I heard that one meets beautiful, morally delinquent women in the arts. - You're thinking of the film business. (laughter) - Ashok, even if you did meet what you call a, morally corrupt woman. - Delinquent. - All right, what will you do? I mean, in your condition what can you do? (Ashok speaks in a foreign language) - Sorry I'm late. (speaks in a foreign language) - You know, busy, busy, busy same old business. Lot of huffing and puffing, but no forward progress. - I hear that's a common problem with a man of your age. - I see, this is a comedy night. (laughter) - [Raj] How's the museum, Dad? - Very good. - Kishan is the best museum guide. He makes you look a familiar paintings with new eyes. (Ashok and Kishan speak in foreign language) - Kishan, tell them what happened at the water lilies. - No, no. - Oh, come on. - No, some other time. - Come on, you must. - Well, today at the museum, I walked into that room with the water lilies. You know, the Monet paintings. And there were a few people about. And a women, with some children, were making a noise. - I hope you didn't have to give them one of your lectures. - Then, some Japanese women walked in, and they formed a small circle in the middle of the room. Their guide stood in the center. Slowly, they started to hum, very gently. And a beautiful sound filled the room. Everyone stood still, and stared, even those children became quiet. The sound just floated like waves, and caressed the paintings. And then the humming stopped, and the whole room was quiet. - What was happening? - I was curious myself, so I went up to the guide and asked him. And he bowed, like the Japanese do, and he said that a Japanese poet came here many years ago, and was so moved by these paintings, that he went back and wrote a song. And the guide then said, that since they were visiting here, they'd bring the song back with them, because this is where it belongs, with the paintings. - Wow. - Would anyone care for dessert? - If it's gulab jamun. - Oh go on, you don't need gulab jamun. You're prosperous enough already. - No, no, no, life isn't worth living without gulab jamun. - Life isn't worth living without poetry and music. - A bottle of burgundy makes life worth living. - [Audrey] Sibelius and Debussy. - No. (laughter) (Kishan and Ashok speak in foreign language) - I've got to tell you, I just adore him. - That's easy for you to say. You don't have to live with him. - Well, you get tired of him, I'll take him. Look, you keep complaining that you don't have any inspiration to write anymore. And right here in your own home is a man who lives poetry. - My god, what's happening to you? (laughter) - Wanna try a paan? Like it? - It's interesting. What is in this? - Betel leaf, which is paan, betel nut, lime, spices, like cardamom and (foreign word) and I don't know the word (foreign word) in English. - In India the streets and walls are stained red. - And foreign tourists think the people are bleeding at the mouth. (laughs) About to have a bloody stroke. - [Audrey] You can have it. Aw, horrible. - Don't worry, it takes only three days before you die. (laughter) - [Jenny] Grandpa, when we get to Fallingwater, what will you do? - [Kishan] I don't know. Maybe I'll pray. (soft vocal music in foreign language) - Excuse me, what language is that? - I believe it's Portuguese. - It's beautiful. I love sad songs in languages that I don't understand. (laughter) (waterfall) - What's the matter, son? - I'm thinking of going back to India. (Kishan speaks in foreign language) - I want to live there. I want to pursue a more spiritual life. Perhaps go to Banaras. - [Kishan] What does Laura think? - Buddha left his family. - So, now you want to be like Buddha? You, what's the matter (slap) with you. - I became a doctor to heal, to help, instead I spend my time attending meetings on petty politics, and worry about lawsuits. There's no meaning for me here, Dad. - What meaning is there sitting by a river in Banaras? - I feel empty, Dad. - You don't need a guru in some godforsaken cave. What you need is to give love. - Things aren't right here. - Then make them right. You make them right. Be thankful for every day that you're alive and healthy. Love the people in your life. They may be here only for a short time. - And we'll get you a book about it, too, okay? There you are. - Jenny, come, let's go for a walk. Where will you like to go, huh? We'll go this way. And you can, come Jennifer, come on. And we'll go see the tree. - Raj. Don't do this silence thing. - Why is Daddy crying? - It's nothing. Your Daddy's fine. Come, see those trees? Look at that. That is so lovely. Just look how the leaves catch the light. You know, we don't have autumn like this in India. Jenny? Jenny? Jenny? Jenny? Has Jenny been here? My God. - [Laura] Jenny? - [Kishan] Jenny? - [Laura] Jenny? - [Raj] Jenny? - [Laura] Jenny, where are you? Jenny? Jenny? - [Kishan] Jenny? All's well that ends well. And the important thing is that she's safe, and unhurt. Oh well, onto each life some rain must fall. - Stop it! Will you stop it, please, Mr. Singh. I've had it up to here with your damn philosophy. I mean, how could you be so irresponsible? - [Raj] Laura. - I don't think I can take this anymore. (Indian music) (children playing) - Let me help. - I can manage. - Come over here? Please? Let's talk. - What's there to talk about? He's gone, you're writing again, you should be happy. What would talking do? - That is so unfair. This is so unfair. (crying) - I'm sorry. Maybe, maybe I can find an apartment for him somewhere. - No, I feel very uncomfortable about that. - Mommy, when is Grandpa coming back? He said he was going to take me to the museum? - Come over here, honey. - Jenny, I have an idea. (Indian music) (Ashok singing in foreign language) (phone rings) (speaks in a foreign language) - Hello. - Grandpa, Grandpa. - How is my (speaks in a foreign language)? - Raj couldn't come, he's on call. I just wanted to say-- - Grandpa, let's go see the dinosaur. - [Kishan] This letter is more than 400-years-old. Found it in India. - [Jenny] Who is it from? - [Kishan] It's from a young woman to her father. - Can you read it? - It says, "Dear Father, as soon as you receive this letter, "please send me shoes. "The man you have married me to doesn't love me. "He beats me. "I must leave him. "The journey will be difficult. "The rains have come. "And the river is flooded. "The path is filled with snakes and mud. "Whether or not I hear from you, "I will start for home during the full moon. "I pray we see each other again." - Then what happened? - We'll never know. - Oh. - [Voiceover] For all your travel needs, call JR Travel. The leader in travel. - Ah, hi, Ashok here. (speaks in a foreign language) I don't think we'll be able to come home for dinner tonight. Are you sure you'll be able to manage? - No, I'll be all right, but I've invited Audrey to dinner, what am I going to do, now? - Ah, ha, (laughs) invited Audrey to dinner. - Don't laugh, she's coming. I promised her home cooked Indian food. What am I going to do now? I can't cook. - There's no problem, ya. I'll give you the recipe over the phone. Get a pen and start writing. - All right. - [Ashok] Two onions. (Indian tabla music) (loud hard bang) (chop) (chop) (chop) (chop) (chop) (chop) (chop) (chop) (sizzling) - Oh. - Hello, hey, door was open so I just came up. - Bad news, the head cook has gone and left me on my own. - Oh, should I go? - No, no, I'm the cook. - [Audrey] Oh, god. (loud beeping) Good cooking. (laughter) - Actually, my wife was a good cook. I'm basically hopeless. - Oh, I'm horrible in the kitchen, too. Must have been very difficult, your wife. - I miss her. Every day. - Hope you don't mind me asking. - No, no not at all. - Sometimes, I think I'd like to be married. Especially around the holidays. But you'd have to put up with them for the rest of the year. Somebody should start a husband rental business, don't you think? - It reminds me, a man once asked Aristotle if he should get married. And Aristotle said, by all means, if it's a good marriage, you'll be happy. If it's not, you'll become a philosopher. (laughter) - So, do you plan on being a philosopher? Or, would you like to try to be happy again? - No, who would want an old man like me? - You'd be surprised. - There's an old poem, "How many friends have I "Water and stone, pine and bamboo "The rising moon over the east mountain "It too is my friend "What need is there I say "To have more friends than five." - Do you know what? - What? - I'm thinking of having a baby. - A new TV again? - No, no, this is the real thing. - But, you're not married, yet. - Well, I don't know if you've heard about this in India, but you can have a baby without being married. - Oh, yes, of course. - I want a child, not a husband. Hey, you could come over and tell stories. - Sure. You know something. - What? - You're the most remarkable woman I ever met. - You gotta get out more often. Speaking of children, did I tell you about Jenny? She's gone on strike. She wants her grandpa. Oh yes, she's driving them both crazy. I say it serves them right. - It's better when Grandpa reads it. - Did you see the invitation from Dr. Lals? - Uh-hm. - Do you wanna go? It's a Diwali dinner, you know Indian New Year. Dad's going to be there, and Ashok. You know, I just thought it might be a good idea if we-- - Mommy, I wanna see Grandpa. - I'm sorry, honey. (Indian music) (party chatter) - Have you ever wondered why Indians shake their heads like this? - No. - You see the trouble is that in India there aren't that many bathtubs. So, when you come over here to America, and you get into the bathtub, the water gets into their ears and they go. (laughter) - When are you coming home? - Soon, soon. I slept with you for a few days. Now I'll sleep with Ashok for a few. - Dad, you're the one who said running away is not the solution. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - But, Raj, he was supposed reach perfection by Christmas. Now I guess it'll have to be postponed. Better stay with me man. We're having such a good time, and it's no big deal. - That's right the deal is not very big. - No. (laughs) (sparklers hiss) - I got this from New York. Happy Diwali. - Oh, this wasn't necessary, Dr. Hussein. - Dr. Hussein, my dear friend from India, Kishan Singh. - Thank you. What do you think? - Hm, lots of energy. - Energy? - Lots of energy. - Hm. How do you like America, Mr. Singh? - Oh, wonderful, but now I miss home. (laughter) - This used to be a wonderful country, when we came in the 70's. But now. I used to have my practice in Washington DC. There's too many blacks now. I've said enough. They hate us Indians. - Surely we're not considered white. - Well, I'm not black. (laughs) - Dr. Lal forgive me for saying this, but we cannot solve our problems with such attitudes. You know, in India-- - In India it's the same damn problem. The minorities can't live properly in society. They should be kicked out. The damn Muslims and Sikhs should be packed into trains and set to Pakistan, or wherever the hell they want to go. No, no offence, Dr. Hussein. I'm only talking the troublemakers. - Maybe you'd like to ship them all off to concentration camps? - This is not a joke, my friend. - You are not my friend. Our culture teaches tolerance. If educated people like you think this way, than there's no hope for us. - I don't have to listen to this bullshit in my own house. - Let's not argue about politics. - You're my guest. I will overlook this. Enjoy the dinner. (Ashok slams plate) - (Dr. Lai speaks in foreign language) - I gotta go. - Come on, come on, this is only a misunderstanding. Please. (Indian sitar music) - Perfect. (birds sing) - Oh my god, how could they know this? Can it be that God talks to us through fortune cookies? - Thought he is busy punishing Catholics. (laughter) - You like Chinese food. We should do this more often. - Yes. (Indian sitar music) (Kishan speaks in foreign language) - Excuse me? - (speaks in a foreign language) I go to Buddha's benevolent care. - I take it you're a Buddhist? - No, but I like his teachings. You know, it's the only religion which makes no claim to divine revelation. - I didn't know that. - Yes. - I just began my study of Eastern religions recently. (Indian music) - Terrific, come tomorrow, I'll give you my address. - Whoa, sorry, I'll get it. Yours? - Yes. (alarm beeps) - Excuse me, sir, I think there's been a mistake. Would you mind coming inside? Okay, thank you. They must not have demagnetized your purchase. - I didn't make a purchase. - Oh, I am sorry, sir, but may I look in your tote bag? - Yeah. - Thank you. Did they give you a register receipt for this? - No, I didn't make this purchase. - Are you all right? - I'm not a thief, madam. - Do you need a doctor, or? - I was headmaster of a school for 30 years. - Are you sick? - No, my son is a doctor here. - I am not a thief, madam. - Calm down, sir, please. - No, I'm just telling you. It was a mistake. - Oh, I'm sure it was, I'm sure it was, sir. Listen, do you need an ambulance or, anything. - No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. - Let me call your home and have someone take responsibility. - No, please, don't do that. - Oh, it's too late. - It's not necessary. - Please just follow me, sir. It's gonna be fine. Please, thank you. (Indian music) - C'mon, Dad, let's go home. - I didn't. - I know, shh. Let's go home. (Indian music) (ethereal humming music) (Indian music)
