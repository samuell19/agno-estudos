(silence) (silence) (a capella singing) (meowing) - You scared me, Mus. (a capella singing) - Ew. Gross. (a capella singing) Shh. That's enough. - Ooh! - Shush, you're snails, not a boy band. Be quiet. - Be quiet, quiet, quiet. (door opens) (startles) - Caroline. Caroline, where are you? Where is that girl? (snails singing) - Oh! (a capella singing) - Hide. - [Grandma] Caroline. (screams) Caroline, please come help. - Phew. (humming) (gasping) (kissing) Now I'm for sure getting in the Flyers club. And send. (phone rings) Oh, no, ow, no wait. - Caroline, I know you're in there. Come out and help me dear. Caroline. It's important that you learn this. - I don't understand you, Grandma. Sometimes you get mad because I don't wanna learn how to make your concoctions. And other times you won't let me... - You don't have to understand me, you have to obey me. My dear forget the closet, and everything you've seen in it. - But I like exploring things, Grandma. - My dear, the less you know, the less danger you'll be in. There are bad people, who want to steal our recipes. If anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself. - What could happen? We have our magic medallions. - Forget the medallion. You can find magic in everything around us. - Like my cell phone? And your remedies, they always keep us out of danger. - My dear, only your love can keep me out of danger. - [Voiceover] Maryanne. Maryanne, are you open? I have to open. - [Customer] I could really use your help, Maryanne. - Good morning. - So glad you're open. We could really use your help. - [Grandma] Well that's what I'm here for. What can I do to help you? - [Customer] It's my son. Got anything for this rash? He keeps scratching at it. - Hmm. - [Customer] Well it's all over his body. It started yesterday. - Did you see the picture I sent you? - The picture of the bottle? (laughs) What's it for? - [Customer] I think he might be having an allergic reaction to something. - I think you use it for flying. - Flying, flying, flying. - [Selu] Don't be silly. There's no such thing as a flying potion. You know if you wanna get in the Flyers club, it's gonna take a lot more than your grandma's perfume. - Maryanne, do you have my herbs? My feet are really hurting me. - Of course I do. I made a special remedy just for you. - I am going to fly, and you'll have to accept me into the Flyers club. - You're too small. They're never gonna let you paraglide. - I don't need to paraglide. This is really going to work. - [Customer] Caroline, where are you? Caroline. Caroline. - Well hey if it doesn't work at least you'll smell nice. - You don't believe me? First you say to look for my grandmother's secrets, and now you're laughing at me. - I was just joking. There's no such thing as a flying potion. Your imagination was flying high, kiddo. (groans) - [Customer] Caroline, where are you? - You're being called, and I've got stuff to do, alright? Bye. - I'm going to fly too. I'll prove it to you. (coughing) Ew. - Oh, what's that smell? - Not me. I take a long bath every single morning. - [Grandma] Is there anything else I can get for you? - [Customer] Yes, echinacea. I think I'm getting sick too. - [Customer] Make sure you have a lot of Vitamin C too... Hey! I was here first. - I won't sell. I've told you a thousand times. - Fly, pen, fly. To New York and California, go. - You better sign the contract. - Fly away, fly away, fly into the skies... Fly away, fly away, fly into the sky today. Uh, that's it! Fly away, fly away, fly into the sky today. - That's just wrong. - But the neighbor's let us use their square every year to celebrate the Fearless Fair, you bully. - You're the last one, Ma'am. All the others have signed. - Maria's still here. - [Man] Maria's gone. - That can't be. Maria. Oh my, I hope Maria didn't sell. (gasps) - It's flying. I knew it. I knew it. It's flying. - Oh, econatural's buying up everything. - Let's see. You wanna fly? (laughs) Look it's the first flying snail! ♪ With the magic, she finally did it ♪ She made a snail fly ♪ We can hardly believe it ♪ With her magic she can do what she wants to ♪ If she only sets her mind to achieve it ♪ She makes the snail fly up high and so low ♪ Flying here and there, everywhere ♪ Look! It's a pen and a snail in the sky ♪ Such a surprise, we all find ♪ - Look. The potion does work. The wonderful potion does work like a charm. Fly away, fly away, fly to the sky today. Feast your eyes, Selu. The potion does work. I'm going to fly. (grunts) Get it, Mus. - [Customer] Caroline, dear. Caroline, will you give me a foot massage? - Okay. - Oh, Maryanne, your granddaughter's a great healer. - Grandma. - Ooh. - Look, Daddy. - Oh, these toys nowadays. - Uh, hi, Grandma. (laughs) - Just what I needed. You think I don't have enough problems? You're always touching things you shouldn't. Come and wash your hands. This is poisonous. - [Caroline] Ow! Ow ow! Ow Ow! Hey, this burns! Grandma! (phone rings) - Hi, Selu. - You sure can doctor a photograph, kiddo. - The photos are real. I kept my promise. - What were you trying to do? It's gonna take a lot more than your grandma's perfume. (laughs) (groans) - Give me the oopall. (laughs) - Very funny Selu. - Give it to me at once. Pay attention to me. - [Jean Pierre] What's the oopall? - The oopall is very dangerous. Where's the bottle you picked up? - The interesting things always get me in trouble. - [Jean Pierre] Boss, you should take a look at this. - Zoom in. - The oopall can be very harmful, Caroline. - Being able to fly is cool. I want to fly. - Things that are valuable... - [Jean Pierre] Fly? [Jean Pierre] Did you hear that, boss? The oopall can make you fly. - Some of our formulas are very delicate. - [Jean Pierre] Move, you fleabag. Get out of the way. - [Granny] Caroline, don't be upset. - [Jean Pierre] Fleabag. - [Caroline] If the oopall is so bad, why do you have it? - [Jean Pierre] Who's going to clean that? Get away from my camera. That's expensive. - [Voiceover] Jean Pierre. - [Jean Pierre] I know, boss. You want to fly too. I will fetch them for you. - Grandma, I just want to fly. - [Grandma] We've talked about this enough. Some of our formulas are very delicate, Caroline. They could be very dangerous in the wrong hands. (groans) - You're using those signs again. They're really hard to understand. - It's important to learn these if you want to be a healer. Not everything can be fixed by just pressing a button. It's time you grew up and learned that. (grunting) (phone rings) - What are you doing? Sit down and put your seatbelt on. - But somebody's calling me. - Turn that thing off. - Oops, I answered. - [Selu] Hey, Caroline, look where I'm at. Still wanna fly with me? - Uh huh. Hey! - Is this who put the idea of flying in your head? - I'm going to fly whether you like it or not. - [Grandma] Come back. Caroline, you can't go back there. - [Caroline] I'm going to the bathroom. - [Grandma] Don't be upset, my dear. I'm taking you to a secret place you're going to love. - I can't hear you. - You can hear me. - Selu. - Hey. - I can see my house from here. - [Snails] She can see her house, her house, her house. - I'm going to fly as well. Brooms are for witches. Let's see, fly away, fly into the sky today. Fly away, fly into the sky today. - What are you doing back there? - [Caroline] Uh, nothing. Everything's fine. - What is he doing here? We're being followed. I'm going to lose him. Hold on, Caroline. - [Caroline] Granny! - [Grandma] What are you doing? Caroline, what's happening? (grunts) Caroline. - Help! (grunting) How do you steer this thing? - The caravan has crashed. (screams) The girl is flying on an umbrella. - [Caroline] Oh my goodness. (screams) - Huh? Oh wow. - Selu. - Caroline? - Look, I'm flying. - But what is that? What are you riding on? Is it magic or something? - You didn't believe me. (screams) - Watch out. I'm coming. (panting) - Caroline. - Wow man, I saw my life flash before my eyes in HD. - You're off your rocker, girl. - But it wasn't bad for my first flight, don't ya think? I'll definitely have to work on that landing. What do you think, Selu? - Is that really an umbrella? - Mus? My grandma? What's wrong with granny? - Uh, this magic stuff is freaking me out. - [Caroline] Come on. I need your help. - That's impossible. Ahh. - Oh no. - [Captain] Accident, mile marker 20. No victims or witnesses, over. - [Voiceover] No victims or witnesses? Sounds like an open and shut case to me, Captain. - Shut case? Be quiet, Murdock. - Grandma, granny. Where's my grandma? - Where'd you come from? (growls) - [Captain] Ow! - Grandma, where are you? What happened to Granny? - Are you Maryanne's granddaughter? - Oh this accident was all my fault. - What's your fault? - I didn't listen, and I flew out the window. - From the crash? - No with my flying umbrella. - Poor girl. Must have hit her head pretty hard. - [Caroline] She has to be here. She couldn't have just disappeared. - Caroline, what happened to your Grandma? - She's gone. There's no sign of her here. - Who are you? Were you involved in the accident? - [Voiceover] Murlock 447, come in Captain. - Hey, look here. - [Voiceover] Someone took my lunch again. I even put my name on it. - These flowers are my Grandma's. Why did she leave them in a row? This means something. - [Voiceover] It's an emergency. My wife wants those containers back. She scares me! (groans) - They're common flowers. They're everywhere. - And these tracks? - Motorcycles, cars, scooters. - Of course, they're from the motorcycle. There was a motorcycle following us. - Hmm. So where were you when the accident happened? Who was driving the caravan? - Her grandmother. I was flying by myself. - On another umbrella? You're coming to the station with me to explain. - Hey, I had nothing to do with it. - I'm not going anywhere without my Grandma. - I'm calling your parents. - [Caroline] I live with my Grandma now. - We'd better go with him. They'll help us find your grandmother. - [Captain] Get your things. - I'll help you find her too, okay? - Alright. I can't leave Grandma's secret potions in the caravan. Hmm, let's see. Ah, here it is. There. Hmm. I'm going to find you, Granny. No matter what. (whimpering) (snails hum funeral march) Don't worry guys. She's only sleeping ♪ Lullaby and goodnight ♪ Go to sleep little snaily ♪ - Finally, it's about time Sonny. They're not sending a tow truck? - I'm a mechanic. - Get in the car. (sneezes) - Bless you. (sneezes) - Excuse me. - Caravan examined. I have to take it to the shop. - No, he can't take it. He's lying. (yawns) It's not true. He's not a mechanic. - What's the problem? - He's the guy who was following us. Wake up. - [Voiceover] Attention Captain, stand down. I got it, found it, by the watermelon. - You're crazy. What did you do to him? - I took out the policeman, and I have the caravan. What about the girl? - Put me down you animal. Put me down. - Hey, let me go. - Ow! (grunts) Let me go. - Put her down you, bully. - [Caroline] Let me go. (grunts) - [Caroline] No, no, let me go. You animal, let me go. No, no, no let me go. Ow! You're hurting me. When my grandma hears about this, you're in for it. You're such a bully. - Bully, bully, bully. - [Voiceover] Bring the girl. (moaning) - Good job, Mus.

Are we still without a connection? - Connection acquired. - [Boss] Zoom in. Rotate 180 degrees. Who is that, clown? Where is the girl? - Where is my grandmother? - What am I doing? What am I doing? - It's no use. He's out of it. What were you trying to do? - My grandmother has been kidnapped. - You're losing it. Kiddo, you can't go around knocking out cops and talking about kidnappings, okay? - Where am I? - Look, econatural cosmetics. They tried to buy my grandmother's business this morning, okay? (beeping) - Hmm, what's this? - [Voiceover] Bring the girl. - Yes, sir, right away. - Selu, stop playing around. You're scaring me. Let go, Selu. You're hurting my arm. (screams) Give me this piece of junk. - Wow, kiddo, that was crazy. It totally took control of me. - [Voiceover] Grab the girl. - [Caroline] Don't you see? I'm right. We have to hide the caravan. Will you help me? - Superflash, I love this ecospray. Especially because I stole it. (laughs) Oh? - Connection up. - What is that idiot doing? - He can't obey. His earpiece is missing. - When I catch him, I'll sew it to his ear myself. (squeaking) - She's here. - Oh. - Boss, where are you? Yoo hoo. (cheers) Oh, there you are. - She's finally mine. - Yes boss, the witch is here. - You haven't interrogated her yet? - I'm on it boss. I'm on it. - Useless. - They'll never find us here. - All of this is my fault. I never listen to her when she tells me what to do. I deserve to be punished, not her. Something awful must have happened to her. Where is she? If they hurt her... - Don't worry. Let me see what I can find out on here. - [Voiceover] Bring the girl. - [Caroline] Stop it, Mus. - It's that company harassing your grandmother, econatural. Let's see where they are. - What's the matter with you, little rascal? (grunts) You're such a pain. I'm sorry, Mus. I can't get anything right. - The factory is next to a flight area. Maybe Luis knows something. I'm sure she can help us. - I'll save her. (grunts) - Don't you be so stubborn. We have ways of making you talk. Sooner or later everybody always does. I know you have miracle formula for hair growth, and I want it. - Hair growth, what a fool. Jean Pierre, stop fooling around. Find out about the oopall. - I want that recipe. - Ma'am. - What have you got? - The policeman is waking up. - Donuts. - [Boss] Can't anyone get it right? - What's going on here? Where did everybody go? - [Voiceover] Captain, come in, Captain. I know it's early, but I'm taking dinner orders now. I was thinking Italian. I know you like Chinese, but I thought we'd change it up a bit. Captain? - What are you up to? (moaning) - [Voiceover] Captain? - That's strange. No sign of that girl or the caravan. - [Voiceover] Come in. This is Murlock. Captain, can you hear me? Okay, we can go with Chinese. I'm okay with Chinese. We can eat Italian tomorrow. - Eh, listen, I need you to look up this lass's plate number for me. Write this down. - Locate them.

No fly zone, dude, totally not cool. - Oh, I know. The one with the dirty smoke. - Not anymore, I don't see it, man. - It has to be there. - Via con dios, bro. - They've got a bunch of lawsuits filed against them for polluting the river, most recently this week. And they claim to be natural. - [Luis] Yeah, natural like pigs, bacon. Look dude, I'm telling you, no factory. - No factory. - Factory, factory, factory. - Well anything? - Nothing yet. Take a closer look, Luis. Maybe it's under the trees or something. I'm telling you, it's gotta be around there somewhere. - [Luis] Seriously dude, trees? There's no factory. - That factory exists. It's where they're holding my grandmother, and I'm going to find it. - We don't know for sure. Don't jump the gun. - [Luis] Dudes, dudes. I'm totally down to help find Granny. Like what can I do? - Keep looking. We'll text you later. Call us if you find anything. Is this you? - Give me that. That's my grandmother. Hello? Hello, Granny? They hung up. - Selu, Selu, who is this Selu you wanted to talk to? A boyfriend? (phone rings) Nice ringtone. (gasps) Hello. - Who are you? - Hi darling, so glad you called. - [Caroline] Where is my grandmother? - [Boss] Don't worry, honey. (grunting) We're treating her like a queen. - [Caroline] I wanna see my grandma. (zapping) - Ha! - Of course. Jean Pierre, trace the call now. - [Caroline] Grandma? - You and I need to talk. - No, Caroline. - [Caroline] Granny! - Hey, hey be quiet you. - Tell me what you want. I'll give it to you just let my grandmother go. - [Boss] Now you're talking. You seem more reasonable than her. I'll let you talk to her. Watch what you say. We know where she is. - Grandma, are you okay? - I'm fine sweetheart. - [Caroline] What's going on? - [Grandma] I'll explain later. Don't worry. I'm okay, Caroline. - Slow down. Can you slow down? - Do exactly as I say. - [Boss] What do you think you're doing? Listen carefully, you meddling little girl. I want the oopall, you got it? Bring me the recipe, or you can forget about your granny. (gasps) - You were right, Caroline. They kidnapped your grandma, but don't worry, I recorded the call on my phone. We'll find her. - How can you be so sure? It's no use. - Hey little... Ah! - Your granddaughter will give me what you won't. (laughs) (sad music) - Sorry, grandma, didn't mean to get you in trouble. (knocks) - [Selu] Caroline. (gasps) (knocking) I have a plan. I texted Luis and told him to meet us at Monte Vintoso. I'm pretty convinced the factory's still there, and I was also thinking that, well... - My grandma told me to take care of her stuff and not to look for her. - What? She said that to you? - She said it with signs. - Ah, very nice. You and your grandma are pretty cool, but look, I've been figuring this out. I found this in the backpack. You know what it is? - Econatural wart remover? I hate it. That's their company. - [Selu] Exactly. Don't you get it? Now we know what they're after. - The oopall. - Not just that. They want to steal all of your grandmother's recipes. Maybe we should get out of here. I've got the chills. - Chills, chills, chills. - Prisoner, Maryanne, yes. Inject truth serum.

The game is starting. - Oh, ho. - Oh, sorry, I thought Jean Pierre was around. Do you know how to play poker? Oh, there you are. Come on, we're late. - Sorry, I have work to do. - Work? I think you just like playing with your toys. - Hello, Mother. - How will I play poker if the new woman you brought me doesn't know how to play and Jean Pierre says he's busy? - I know how to play poker. - Oh, I'm saved. - No. - Yes, yes, you know I have to play. The doctor recommended it, remember? - Mother, this woman does not know how to play poker. - But poker's. (grunting) Poker's my favorite game. (grunting) - Oh, that settles it. Come on just one hand. - Alright, we'll have to search the whole area. - I'll handle that. If Grandma's in the factory, I'll be able to find her. - Caroline, now you're the one giving me chills. Don't tell me you have powers. - You're going to have to trust me. What we need is a plan to break in and rescue her, but security's gonna be really tight. - Yeah, but don't forget, we are birds. Who'll expect an aerial rescue? - This is econatural factory. All of the products are natural. - [Mother] Give her the tour later. Come on. Hurry up. - Our logistics department is enviable. It takes our products to every corner of the planet. - Oh, this recipe isn't yours. - Everything here is mine. Everything. - Who did you steal this recipe from? - [Mother] Come on, come on. Stop arguing. - Thanks to me, these products are commercialized. If you cooperate, your recipes could be world famous. - You'll never get my recipes no matter what. - Well before they take off, how about a little poker? Come on let's play. Everyone sit down. The game is starting. I'm so nervous. (laughs) Come on, there's no time to lose. Watch and learn. I'll deal. - Maria, what have they done to you? - Maria's being treated like a queen. Aren't you? - I'm very happy here. - She was better off in her caravan. - [Maria] I live like a queen. - She has all she needs. - Shh, you've kidnapped her just like you did me. - Keep quiet. We're trying to play. Are you in or out? - You're going to have to wait outside. You're not supposed to see my granny's things. I have to find the formula for the oopall. - You're not giving it to econatural? - Not if I don't have to, but I might have to trade it for her, okay? - Dispatch, patrol reporting to healer's. Look out for a woman named Maryanne, and also that econatural factory that makes lotions. Let's see why they have so many lawsuits. - [Voiceover] Copy that, Captain. So, um, about dinner. We going Chinese or Italian? I can do Chinese, I'm okay. - Hand signals? What's this for? It says to sprinkle and mix. There's so much to do. I really should have listened to my grandmother. - Your grandmother's glue is no good. - Magic hair growth recipe. Who would want such a thing? What nonsense. I don't understand any of this. - [Voiceover] I was dreaming of Italian, but Captain wants Chinese. I want a number three special, so tell me Captain please, can I order Italian? Tell me Captain. - Go ahead, just stop your singing. Okay, now tell me where that caravan is. They're right around the corner. - Mus. Get out of here. You slob, look what you did. You got everything wet. What's this supposed to be? (screaming) - [Selu] Caroline, the police officer's here. We need to leave or he's gonna arrest us. - [Voiceover] Murlock 447 calling Captain Charlie. It's an emergency. They're out of garlic rolls. Maybe we should order Chinese. I'll call ahead and make sure they have spring rolls. Copy that? - The oopall can be used for the forces of good, just as it can be used for the forces of bad. Hmm. It's made with flowers. - [Snails] Made with flowers. [Caroline] very rare that grow [Snails] Very rare. [Caroline] far from [Snails] that grow very far [Caroline] everywhere. [Snails] from everywhere. [Caroline] They are a bright [Snails] They are a bright [Caroline] violet in color. [Snails] violet in color. [Caroline] And release a very [Snails] And release a very [Caroline] foul odor. [Snails] foul odor. [Caroline] (laughs) I already noticed that. An intelligent flower, [Snails] An intelligent flower [Caroline] when people are [Snails] when people are [Caroline] around, they cower. [Snails] around, they cower. [Caroline] If they sense a [Snails] If they sense a [Caroline] person around, they [Snails] person around, they [Caroline] evolve, fly high, [Snails] evolve, fly high, [Caroline] and uproot from the [Snails] and uproot from the [Caroline] ground. [Snails] ground. [Caroline] Evolve, like a Pokemon? Where is this place? Of course, that's why she has this flower dress. Oh here it is. This should be the right map. - Caroline, we have to go. We can't wait any longer. - You can't see this. Don't look, get out. - I already saw you fly on an umbrella. - Promise not to say anything to anyone? - Of course. - They're my granny's secrets. - [Selu] Cool. It says something here. - What? Oh wow, cool, it's my grandmother's recipe. - [Voiceover] In 100 feet, stay to your right. You are crossing the San Gabriel region. - Mmm, mmm. (grunts) - Come on, come on. - Do you know where they could be? I have to find those flowers to save my grandmother. - Yeah, if I can get this thing to go. (revving) - Let's go. - Those things are really weird. - I know. They're really annoying. They follow me wherever I go, and I just can't get rid of them. (screams) Guys, knock it off, will you? - There. - Yea! - Okay, let's go. You know the area we're going to on the map is a natural ecosystem. - Well that's where we're going. - According to the map, those lands are protected. - I'll be careful. You don't have to worry about me. I feel awful for not paying attention to my grandmother. I've been reading a lot about healers, and well... - Must be exciting learning about all those mysteries and secrets with your grandmother. - And also really sad because many of them lost everything. They were burnt at the stake. - Man, that is really sad. - [Caroline] And people called them witches. I've been called a witch too. - Well I think witches are cool. (laughs) (mocking laugh) - We're being followed. - Just what we need. (sirens) More company. We gotta lose them. Hold on tight. (screaming) (sirens) - Try the others. Maybe they'll make her talk. - The recipe, obey. - Talk, Maryanne. - Give us the recipe. - Give us the recipe. - [Maria] Give us the recipe. (humming) - [Voiceover] Rose, tell her to talk. - [Rose] Talk Maryanne. - The flying recipe. - The flying recipe. - [Rose] Give us the flying recipe. - Four aces.

Never. - Prepare the machine. We'll see if she talks or not. (ominous music) (playful music) (groaning) - No Mus, you can't come with me. - You really shouldn't go alone. - You can't. There's only one suit, and it doesn't fit you. - But I could help you. - No, you can't. Stay with Luis and organize the rescue. - Okay. You sure are brave. - Meet him at Monte Mintosa at dawn, okay? And please take care of the caravan too. There are valuable things inside. - Alright, well I promise to guard it with my life, but be careful, and come right back. (upbeat music) (ominous music) (laughs) - It's made with flowers, very rare, that grow very far from everywhere. That's no joke. (grunts) (gasping) - The girl, where is she? (panting) (snarling) - Why you. You bully, why don't you pick on somebody your own size? I said somebody your size. - The girl isn't in the caravan. (sirens) (sighing) (gentle music) (sniffing) - They're violet in color and release a foul odor. I don't understand. The trail should be around here somewhere. - Your friend has disappeared, and this econatural worker is in shock. That makes two. You're not good at making friends. - [Selu] Listen, their boss kidnapped my friend's grandmother. - [Captain] Sure, a kidnapped grandmother. That's where we'll go around knocking everyone at. - [Voiceover] Murlock 447 to Captain. Captain your spring rolls are getting cold. - Let's have a look. (grunts) - Are you comfortable? - Come on, Jean Pierre. Why are you being so nice? (creaking) (gasps) (chirping) - It's the sign of the triskellion. (rumbles) This is it. (sniffing) - Do you like (mumbles) Of course you do! Well this thing will make your head spin. (laughs) - Jean Pierre, stop the chitchat and begin. - Okay, okay, and here we go. (laughs) (groans) (gasps) (laughs) - Hmm. Hmm. (piano music) (gasps) (piano music) (chiming) - An intelligent flower, when people are near they cower. If they sense a person around, they evolve, fly high, and uproot from the ground. Of course. That was it. They rise in the air like larks, but be careful, they give off dangerous sparks. - Oh, oh, it burns. - It's so horrible. I can't even look. - Oh, boss, she's a stubborn one. She's not saying a word. - I've had enough. Turn it up to maximum power. - We don't know if the machine can handle it, but... - No buts, now. - [Voiceover] Murlock 447 calling all units. Anybody going by a donut shop? I could really use one of them bearclaws. No, wait, wait, wait, Charlie. - Cursed flowers. They burned me everywhere. - Shh. - It's the flowers defense mechanism. - [Captain] Defense? That wasn't defense. That was offense. - [Selu] The conditions they need to grow only exist in a few places on the planet. And this is one of them. - [Captain] Be quiet, you know-it-all. We're leaving. - What a mess. (car engine starts) - Hmm. - We're on our own now, Mus. Come on, Mus. This GPS will come in handy. Directions to Monte Vintoso. Search. (panting) (gulping) (snoring) (gasps) - What is that? You scared me, Mus. (gasps) This looks like a good place to spend the night. - Stubborn old woman. We may have something here boss. Translate. - [Voiceover] One small banana, a cup of blueberries, add pomegranate seeds, a tablespoon of honey, (groans) and a pit. (sighs) - From the first seven flowers, take seven petals and one yellow stamen. From the next seven flowers, take six petals and two yellow stamens. It's so precise. - Ew. (burps) Burp, burp, burp. - Fooling around as usual. Please behave yourselves. From the next seven flowers, take five petals and three yellow stamens until you have one petal for every seven stamens. This sure is complicated. (snoring) (upbeat music) (laughs) There we go. Why didn't I read this before? Finally, you must hydrate the paste, adding seven drops of water for each flower. Oh no! I was supposed to add water? (gasps) I really need to find some water. (thunder) (laughs) I can't believe it. This is amazing!

(upbeat music) (panting) Just a little further. (upbeat music) Monte Vintoso. Where's Luis? Huh? Mus, come back. (laughs) - [Luis] You're like a funny little creature, but like what are you? Oh hey, you're Caroline, right? - Yes. - Where's Selu? He's going to be coming by later with the policeman. I hope. - [Luis] Well what's the plan? Like where are we going cause there's totally no factory? - Don't worry about it. I can tell you where we're going. Just give me a minute. - Hmm. (sad music) (cheerful music) - [Luis] Whoa, hold on. What is going on, Caroline? You're like totally freaking me out. - I don't know what you're talking about. If we follow this butterfly trail, it will lead us straight to my grandmother. - And the umbrella? - The umbrella's coming along with us. - Alright, alright, little lady. Like whatever it takes to help find granny. (upbeat music) (gasps) - The factory. - Far out. It was totally there the whole time. I totally can't believe it. (laughs) - They were hidden by the clouds. I bet they were made to camouflage the factory. - Hold on little lady. Here we go. - Can you get us closer to that window down there? - Totally. - Fly away, fly away, fly into the sky today. Fly away, fly away, fly into the sky today. - Whoa, Caroline, be careful. You're throwing off our balance. - No, Caroline, don't do that. - I'm sorry, I have to do it this way. - Caroline! Flying umbrella? What was in my Cornflakes this morning? Hold on, Caroline, I'm coming. - Please, go distract the guards. Mus! - Whoa, here I come little dude. Oh, I got you dude. Mus, what are you doing? - [Voiceover] You are flying over private property. (gagging) Attention, flying over this area is forbidden. (screaming) (ominous music) - That was close. (screaming) - I checked, and there's no one in corridor five. There's no one in corridor four either. - Stubborn woman. - Stop. Stop. (grunts) Stubborn woman must be my grandma. (gasps) Grandma? Grandma? Granny. Wake up, it's Caroline. Open your eyes. - One small banana. - Are you hungry, Grandma? - And a cup of blueberries. - You poor thing. Don't worry grandma. When we get back to the bus, I'll make you a tasty meal. (gasping) - Well, well, well. The little girl who can fly. - I am taking my grandmother. - Of course, darling. What a wonderful invention. (groans) - Help me. I want to try it. Okay, okay, let go. - What have they done to you, Grandma? Your hair is blue. (laughing) - [Jean Pierre] Oh, careful boss. (squealing) - Oh, it's wonderful. I've been searching for this formula for years, and it's finally mine. Sweeties, you are my guests. - Let us go. - Of course, it's getting late, but first give me the oopall recipe. - Don't say a word. - [Jean Pierre] Oh, don't listen to her. - It's our job to protect the oopall from dangerous people like you. (muttering) - What about progress? Technology is the future. Haven't you explained that to your grandmother? - Technology and nature must stick together. - Stick together? - If we don't respect nature, we have no future. - [Boss] Exactly. Econatural cosmetics, the future of cosmetics. - [Grandma] You're bad, and you'll pay dearly for it. - No, Granny don't. Please just give me a moment to talk to her by myself. - You have five minutes. I hope they're productive. - Maryanne and Caroline, I've got my eyes on you. Don't try something crazy. - [Boss] Be quiet, already. - [Jean Pierre] I come after you. - [Caroline] No, don't say that again. Just listen to me. I know what to do. (whirring) See? - No, no, no. - There's no other options. - [Boss] Well, little girl? - We'll give you the formula. - [Boss] Now you're talking. (snails singing) - [Boss] I want the oopall. You've got it. Bring me the recipe or you can forget about your granny. - This telephone recorded and the ear piece gives us enough proof to arrest the owner of econatural. Would you like to testify as a witness? - Of course I would. - [Boss] I love this little device. With this formula, I'll be a super goddess. Oh, how exciting. Start dictating. Oh, what flowers are these? - I already gave you the instructions. If you keep interrupting me, I'm going to get it wrong. - But what are they called? - They're called, none of you business, lady. - You need to give me my umbrella back. - [Boss] Then what will I use to fly? - You can use whatever you like. Your shoes or a broom probably fits you better. - I can fly without an umbrella? With my own shoes? - Just make sure you rub a lot of cream on the bottom of your shoes, otherwise it won't work. - Fly, fly, higher than anyone else. - Now give me my umbrella. - Alright, but first let me try the cream. - [Grandma] Don't do it, Caroline. - Ignore her, she is more out of date than a horse and carriage. - Forgive me, Grandma, I'm doing this for your own good. - Enough with the mushy talk. Keep going. Ooh, what's that? - Lady, I'm warning you. - Well, is it ready? - You are forgetting the main ingredient. - Be quiet, let her concentrate. - Huh? - Resin? - Resin, so you won't fall off the umbrella. Although that wouldn't be so bad. - Uh, it's so the ingredients stick to each other. It's ready. - You can still change your mind. - Change her mind. It's already mine. Sit down and be quiet. - What have you done to her? Get that off her. - Keep quiet, you. - Jean Pierre, rub it on my shoes. (singing) The oopall is a little sticky. - [Jean Pierre] Yes, very sticky, yes. (groaning) Boss, I think we have a problem. (laughs) - What's going on? What's wrong with the ear piece? - I put in on her boss. - [Boss] Jean Pierre, you're as useless as they come. - Grandma, what happened? - I'm deaf in this ear, remember? (laughs) All I had to do was wait until the glue took effect. (laughs) - That was really great. Thank you for guiding me through it with your signs. - You see my dear, sometimes old teachings have their advantages. - You have to teach me everything. - Yes. Because not all those ingredients were necessary. This recipe will also make your hair grow. - You can't do this to me. - Grandma, it's time to get out of here. I'll take this. (groaning) - Ooh, keep your hands off my iPad. Witches, you're witches. - [Caroline] Not witches. - [Grandma] Not witches. [Caroline] Healers. [Grandma] Healers. - Guards after them. They're escaping. - Wait, we need to free the others. - [Guard] Stop right there. - Hi, want to play some poker? They're friends. Let them come in. - [Guard] Go on. - Come on, girls, we're going home. - Hello, Maryanne. Haven't seen you in a long time. - Hmm, nobody's getting past me. - HiYa, oh, my bad. - Accidents happen. - Come on girls. - What a game. Oh what are we playing now? - Hold on girls. (groaning) - Knock it off and help me. - Goodie, we're pretending we're robots now. (thuds) - [Luis] Go Caroline. - Come on, the exit is this way. - Forget it, I'm not playing this anymore. - Then you'll have to play solitaire. We're leaving. - Solitaire. How boring. (groans) - Dude, karma. - Halt, stop where you are. - My lord, your Alfatzi's son. How's your mama? Did the crystal I gave you help with your scary nightmares? A growing boy needs his sleep. (thuds) - They must be stopped. I want that recipe. (squealing) (screams) - Oh mon cheri. You and me. I knew it all along. My love. (thuds) (laughs) - Mus! - [Boss] Guards! - Call the guards. Guards, guards, guards. - I'm not having fun. Where is everyone? - Grandma, help me. Come on, hurry. I think there's an exit this way. (upbeat music) - Come on. (laughs) (groaning) - Come on, girls. Oh! This way. (laughs) (gasps) (groans) - Boss, I've got the intruder. - Forget solitaire. I want to play this. - Mus! You're so brave. (gasping) - Grandma. - I got her. Run, ladies, run. - [Luis] Hey, where do you think you're going? - Good, Luis. Let's get out of here. - There they are. Get them. What are you doing? Get them. - [Luis] It's ninja Luis time. - [Boss] Stop them. - Caroline, help me. This stuff smells terrible. - Leave her alone. HiYa. - [Selu] Hey, Mr. Bully. Here you go. Nothing beats a face full of econatural foam. - Selu. - How do you like that? What are you gonna do about it big guy? (laughs) I was kidding. (gags) (beeps) Thanks. (laughs) (slurps) (laughs) (screams) - Get moving, Jean Pierre. We can't let them escape. - Hmm. - Arrest those witches. They destroyed my factory. - No Ma'am, I'm not here to arrest them. - Will they have bananas and blueberries at the hospital? - Oh, I have a craving. - Wow, you smell like a sewer. - Mhmm. - [Captain] You're under arrest for theft, kidnapping, and illegal video surveillance. - You don't know what you're doing. I'm a very important person. - Oh, and for polluting the environment, another reason to put you in jail. - [Voiceover] Attention, Captain, attention. About breakfast, I'm bringing hard-boiled eggs. - [Captain] And as for you, young lady. - That's odd. Why is he scolding her? - Ooh. - You're a very brave young girl. (gasps) - Blech. Black licorice. That's disgusting. - What did he say? - To take care of you. - Right, take care of me. - Granny, technology, just like the oopall can do both good or bad. - Yes, sweetie. It all depends on how we use it. I'll try to use this thing the right way. - Granny is on fire today. (laughs) - Thank you. We couldn't have done it without all your help. - Whoa, this stuff smells. (laughs) (whispers) - Grandma. Well, Grandma, what do you think? - It's beautiful up here. (cheerful music) - Look at all the plants down there. - [Grandma] Yes, that's the elderberry flower. I thought I'd never find it anywhere - Aren't those the ones you use for earaches? - [Grandma] Yes, that's one of its many uses. - Pretty awesome up here, huh Granny? No need for that umbrella any more. You're flying with us. - Don't worry, you don't need that thing any more. (laughs) - Did you see that, Grandma? - [Grandma] See what, sweetie? - Oh nothing. - [Selu] That's just an umbrella. Now you're part of the Flyers club. - [Caroline] Selu, will you come with me to pick flowers tomorrow? - [Selu] Flowers are useless. You don't need that recipe to fly anymore. - [Caroline] The recipe? (laughs) Oh. ♪ One small banana ♪ A cup of blueberries ♪ Add pomegranate seeds ♪ And stir it up ♪ (upbeat music)
