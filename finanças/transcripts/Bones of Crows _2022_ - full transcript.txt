(♪♪) (wind blowing) (cawing) (cawing) - Are you hungry? I said, are you hungry? Because it's your lucky day. Rations are in. Come on up here! Come on, let's go! Get a move on! There you go! You can make it! Yeah, keep on coming! Up you come! Here we are! There you go, come on now, let's move! Come on right up here! Come on, let's go, right up here! Come on! Right up! Here you go! Right! Come on! Come on up! There we go, we got flour, we got fresh meat, we got vegetables, and fruit. Hmm? Come on now, let's go! Yes, you, young man! Come on, come right up here! There you go, there you go! April Fool's Day! (laughing) April Fool's Day! (laughing) We got nothing! It's April Fools Day! - Mr. Quinn, stop! - It's a fucking joke! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Joke! How do you say "joke" in Cree? (speaking in Cree) (Mr. Quinn repeats.) (laughing) Ah, fuck off then! The rest of you, fuck off. Go on, fuck off. Get the fuck away... go away. Get away with ya's! Bunch of useless fuckers! (♪♪) I said, are you hungry? Yeah, well, if you're hungry, you go to the reservation we gave you, you ungrateful leeches! You will go now or for the love of God... (neighing) (dramatic music) (gun cocking) (gunshot) (cawing) (soft guitar music) (singing in Cree) ♪ If my friend ain't got no money ♪ ♪ And I say, take all of mine, honey ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody's business if I do ♪ ♪ If I do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ If I give him my last nickel ♪ ♪ And it leaves us in a pickle ♪ ♪ It ain't nobody's business if I do ♪ ♪ If we do, do, do ♪ (in Cree) ♪ Business if I do ♪♪ - Ah! (chuckling) (speaking in Cree) (sighing) (laughing) (laughing) (ritual singing) (yelling indistinctly) (laughing) (classical piano music) Aline... Aline... (playing piano) You usually smile when you play. (chuckling) You have me now. - We should get dressed. We're going to be late to our own wedding. (laughing) - I could stay here forever. - Me too. But the world has different plans for us. Come on. Oh... - Cold feet? - No, it's just... (chuckling) My shoelace. (laughing) You're good at that. - Don't get any ideas! - Are you sure about this? - I was sure the first time I saw you. - Okay. (chuckling) (speaking in French) - I do. (speaking in French) - I do. (continues speaking in French) - Hey... (Aline): Thanks for coming. You alright? - Yeah, it's been a long time since I've seen my brother. He was always the lucky one. But he doesn't have you. (laughing) Which makes me the luckiest bastard in the world. - I want you to be... - Careful. I think it will be a careful war. - Stop it. - I'll be careful. I have you now. I'll be careful. Say it. (in Ayajuthem) We don't have goodbyes in my language. We don't have goodbyes in my language either. (in Ayajuthem) (train hissing) (soft music) (mechanical clanking) (train whistling) (dramatic music) (train chugging steadily) - Mr. Miller. - Sister Ruth. Good afternoon. It's time for Aline's piano lesson. Three o'clock. - I know how to tell time. - Yes, Sister. - We've been experiencing a burden of duties, Mr. Miller. With so many of our children sick, we need to knuckle down and pick up the slack. I'm sure you understand. - Forgive me, but... I'm not sure Father Jacobs would... understand, Sister. He has requested Aline play at his special dinner next week. And she will need to prepare and practice the piece he has selected. He's in his study if you'd like to speak with him. - No. That won't be necessary. Enjoy your time, Aline. Your duties await you. Not all of us have special privileges. Keep the line straight and your eyes down. No need to idle. Keep the line straight. (door closing) - There is a request from Father Jacobs. It's... a complicated piece. But... I think you're ready for it. - Yes, Mr. Miller. - I told you, you can call me Thomas. - Yes. - I want you to close your eyes. I'm going to take your hand. And put it over mine. Like this. Now, find my left hand. Now, just listen to the notes as I play them. And stay on top of my hands. (soft notes) There you go. (bright piano melody) What are you feeling? - I feel... free. - We share the love of music. I can see that in you. You can be free... in this room, Aline. You can be free with me. (horse neighing) (soft music) (soft piano music) (beeping) - Attention! As you were. (indistinct chatter) (beeping) You. My name is Major Stevens. - Aline. - Spears. I know. You're graduating soon. - Yes, sir. - Congratulations on that. And, of course, your marriage. He's overseas? - Yes, he was sent over right after. - Do you know where your husband is stationed? - First, London. And then, he'll receive his orders from there. - We're sending you to London, after your graduation. - I thought most of the Morse code operators were based here in Canada, sir? - That's correct, but we're putting together a special operation. It says in your file you're Cree. - Yes, sir. If that's a problem... - On the contrary. Are you still fluent in your language? It's nothing to be ashamed of. - No, sir. I mean... Yes, sir, I still speak Cree. - The opportunity I'm talking about would be a secret division within the Canadian Air Forces. It's highly sensitive. You'll be briefed when you get there. - I understand. - How good are you at keeping secrets? I don't mean to be indelicate, but women... aren't known for this skill. - I have a lot of experience. - Do you want time to think about it? - No, sir. - We'll be in touch after your graduation. 24 words a minute, I hear. - Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Sir. - Aline... Your left hand. - It doesn't interfere with my work, sir. It was a... childhood accident. - We might be able to do something about it. Would that be of interest to you? - Yes, sir. Thank you. (in Cree) (indistinct chatter) My name is Charlie Tomkins. I'm from Alberta, around Grand Prairie. Métis/Cree. Welcome. - Aline Spears. Cree. - Would you like to follow me? - Yes. Thank you. - We've come up with a system to translate English into Cree, and then back again. I'll walk you through a few things here, and I'll walk into the other room, and we'll continue to translate over the phone. It's pretty straightforward. But there are some things we Cree don't have words for. Like there is no word for a Spitfire plane. So I've named it "iskotew". - Fire. - Yes, fire. The mustang aircraft... Other common names we use are... Bee. Seventeen. - For the B17 bombers. (chuckling) What would you say if an order read, "20 B17 bombers spotted"? Excellent. You'll receive codes from the field in Cree and then translate them into English to the Commanders here, and vice versa. The Germans haven't been able to crack our code. How did you keep your language? - Secret codes. - We've been training all of our lives. You can call me Checker. - Okay. Checker. (beeping) (soft piano music) - Here, at this school, we have 324 students who are being kept on a strict diet. A caloric measure that will keep them in a state of malnutrition. Little meat, little fresh vegetables, and a low-grade flour which we purchased at a damn good price. (laughing) This allows us to keep costs here low, which I'm sure you can appreciate allows for other human luxuries such as this beautiful meal. (laughing) - I think you're stringing us along for effect. How are you gathering your data? - Biochemical tests to measure protein for growth. As well as intellectual and aptitude tests to see how this affects their ability to learn. Nothing conclusive yet. Naturally, we're seeing a rise in sickness, particularly TB and the measles. Disease feeds on poverty conditions. On the other hand, we're giving 126 of our students vitamins and iron supplements, and we are monitoring them. We keep the food under lock and key, and all dietary records are kept for all meals, so that we can manage the outcome. - Perseverance. (classical music playing) - It's too much. They need more food. (laughing) - Nonsense. Nonsense, Thomas. You know, I worry about this new generation. Too soft. Just off the boat to boot. (laughing) I think that we owe a lot to your mother country, Mr. Miller. If it wasn't for England, the residential school system would never exist. Industrial... - They were abolished in 1843. - Industrial schools were what made England great. Colonization of Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and now Canada. Indians... All of them, one way or another. Not a shred of civilization combined. What's the name of the Deputy... Indian Affairs fellow? What did he call it? - The Final Solution to the Indian problem. Duncan Campbell Scott. (chuckling) (speaking in French) (speaking in French) I mean, Your Excellency rarely speaks, but when he does... One-two! (laughing) Come on, Thomas, don't look so glum. - John A. Macdonald said if you want to motivate the Indian, you must starve him. Who are we to argue with such visionaries? Progress waits for no man. (glass clinking) - Thomas. Would you get Aline to play Bach? The piece I requested. - Oh... Yes. Hey! (laughing) (She plays a piece by Bach.) - A prodigy in our midst. It is a great mystery that someone of her race, with no training, with no access to the cultured things in life, can play like a young wonder. God works his miracles in all of us and he's merciful to be sure. (chuckling) Oh. Young Thomas also had news. Please, share. - I've been accepted as a deacon. (cheering) - Our man of the cloth. Welcome to the brotherhood. (glasses clinking) (cawing) (music stops) (moaning) - You've gotten skinny. You okay? - I will be. Word is it could be months, or even weeks. - We'll get to set up a home soon. Start a family. - I haven't heard the word "home" in a long time. You? - No. We'll have to decide where we want to live. They'll give us land when we're released. - I wouldn't count on it. Indian guys that have been shipped off to Canada got nothing. No land. No benefits. We can't count on anything. - Things have changed. - I know, you think... being in a special secret unit makes you special. But you wait. They take everything in you, leave you nothing. Like why is it you can't even tell your own husband what you do? - I took an oath. - An oath? You took an oath to me. Or that doesn't count? Any other secrets you haven't told me? - What are you talking about? - How many men were you with before me? (puts his glass down) There's... There's something you're not telling me. Some secret inside you. I'm sorry. I love you. It's just... It's been a long damn war. It's been a long damn war. (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (gunfire in the distance) (boy): Adam, look! (panting) (In Dutch) It's going to be alright. (singing) (lightbulb buzzing) (high-pitched ringing) - You look worried, Aline. The surgery on your hand is going to go just fine. You won't feel a thing. - I wish that was true. Could have been true. - We'll count you down backwards. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5... (in Cree) Run! (Sister Ruth): We ask that you forgive the sins of these children. In Jesus Christ's name. You didn't think your master escape would go unpunished? We'll go to the post. (cawing) - God takes one thing away... and gives another. (humming) (birdsong) (vehicles honking) (church bells sounding) - It was my grandmother's song. She used to sing it to my brother and me. - Don't you think it's too early? Something... wrong might happen. - It'll make her stronger. - Her? - It's a her. I know it. - Are you scared? - No. We'll be okay. Are you scared? - Yeah. A little. - That's why we have each other. We'll make it work. You're leaving next week. And... I just have one more deployment. You'll finally have the use of your... left hand again, maybe even play piano with two hands. And we can finally start this life we've been talking about. We'll have this baby girl, and then we can have a boy. - You're getting ahead of yourself. - I'm just so happy. I'm so happy. What's wrong? Talk to me. - When things are too good... I'm just scared that things will be taken away. You're so happy. I don't want to spoil everything. - You're not spoiling everything. The war is almost over. Who will take them away? - I don't know. I just have a feeling... that something bad is coming. And we won't be able to protect them. - From what? (Aline): The world. - It's the law, Matthew. You'll go to jail if you don't sign. You don't want to go to jail, hmm? Think of the education they will receive. You want that, don't you, January? For them to be educated? Think about that. Maybe they won't have to live like this for the rest of their lives. They can have a real future. - I want my children home where they should be. Children need their parents. We provide for them! We love them! - I'm tired of the jawing here. All the Squaw needs to know is we can throw them in jail and throw away the key. - Won't be much good to your children then. (crying) (whimpering) (crying) - Ah. That's a smart man, Matthew. One day, your family will thank you for this. You'll see. We don't always know what's best for ourselves. That's why we have the government and the church to look after our best interests. (whimpering) (in Cree) Aline. Now. (door opening) (speaking in Cree) (screaming) - Let go! No! (continues screaming) Mom! (dramatic music) (crying) (screaming) (dramatic music) Perseverance. It's gonna be alright. - Almost there. Wake up! (distant sirens) (sighing) (creaking in the distance) (panting) (gasps) - Momma... (baby crying) (crying) - You fucking animal. You fucking pig. (whimpering) (grunts) (siren blaring) (grunts) (metallic door creaking) - Everybody out! (door buzzing) (door closing) - Suzanne, your inmate ID number is J503445. Rose, your inmate ID number is J503097. Perseverance, your inmate ID number is J503448. Your number is 58. You are 58. Do you understand? Move! Your inmate ID number is... (door closing) - Rude. Shit. What the hell now? - That ain't so bad. At least, we got this big old lock between us. Keeps us in, but on the other hand, keeps them out. - Amen, sister. - Where you from? - Dene. Little Duck Lake. You? - Cree. Outside of Brandon. - They imprisoned some real famous Crees here from the beginning... and now you. Chief Poundmaker, Chief Big Bear. - I feel at home now. - Oh, and one crazy lady who screamed all the time. Probably from my tribe. (laughing) - Shit... - Hey, you got kids? - Yeah. Three. I signed some paper so I could see them sooner. Both the detective and the lady from Family Services said it was the best thing to get them back. Hmm. You? - They took him. Foster care. Haven't seen him since he was born. - I'm sorry. - It's in the past. - My sister's coming. I'm gonna ask her to help out. - That's good. You got a plan. - Tonight? - Shh! - What do you mean tonight? - When everyone is asleep and only Sister Theresa is on watch. I want you to get down, make your way to the broom closet. And then, I'll meet you there. You understand? Perseverance, look at me. Once we start, we won't be able to turn around. Johnnie and Tye will be waiting by the tool shed. We'll wait until the coast is clear. We'll get as far as we can. Then, we'll follow the trapline back home. They won't think of that. - We'll see Mom and Dad, right? We'll be home, everything will be like it was. You promise? (knocking twice) - Be careful. (knocking twice) (phone ringing) (indistinct chatter) - Hey. - Hey. - You look... You look good. - Liar. - Your turn. - You look good, Perseverance. (chuckling) - Bullshit. I look like shit. - Alright. Glad that's over with. - I'm sorry I missed Adam's funeral. - It was seven years ago. I wouldn't worry about it. - I heard you moved to Toronto. - We needed a fresh start. - How's that working for you? - Fine. - Look, I... I need you to find my kids. I need you to find out where they put them. Can you do that? - I'll do everything that I can. - You promise? - Eight years is a long time. - I know how to do time. Plus, I'll get out for good behaviour. (laughing) - I doubt it. - Sis, I've changed. Reformed-like, shit. Mm-hmm. AA-ing it. NA-ing it. Learning how to trade. (chuckling) - You should have said, learning a trade... Not learning to trade. (laughing) - Oh... Oh, man, it was good to see you. (buzzer sounding) - Alright, I'm gonna have to ask you folks to leave. (indistinct chatter) - I hate to leave you here. - This way, this way! - Is that what you said to yourself? - Wait up, Aline. Wait up. (door closing) (footsteps approaching) (door closing) - Perseverance? Perseverance! Come here! Come! - Yes, Father? (praying in French) (breathing heavily) (cawing) (panting) - Come on, Tye. We're close. We have to keep moving. (panting) (clanking) (screaming) - Perseverance. You have to tell me. What way are they going? They're not on the main roads. No? No... This is not you, Perseverance. Hmm? You're so beautiful, Perseverance. Now, be a good girl and tell me where they are. Right now. (crying) I could kill you and bury you out back, and nobody... nobody would care. Tell me, Perseverance, or so help me God! (crying) - Tye. We have to keep moving. Johnnie, he's not breathing! (cawing) - You did the right thing. - How did they know? (dramatic music) (sirens blaring) - Mama! - Fucking stupid slut! - Oh, fuck you, asshole! (moaning) (grunting) Aline... Hold my hand. Aline. (in Cree) Hmm. (humming) Shut the fuck up, you whore! Shh! (muffled singing) (crying) (eerie music) - He's gone to a better place. - Did you tell our parents? They should know. - What would you like me to tell them? That you and Johnnie planned to run away? And you took little Tye with you? And he died from the cold? How about I tell them he died of influenza, like many of the sinful children here? Somehow, that seems more merciful. Head down. Dear Lord, we ask that you forgive Aline and Johnnie for causing the death of their younger brother. We ask that you forgive the sins of these children. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Johnnie, Father Jacobs is waiting for you in his parlour. You should get along now. After this fiasco, this is the last time you will see him here. Take a good long look at your brother. Perseverance, I have business with your sister. It's time for you to go back to your dorm. Perseverance, now. You didn't think your master escape would go unpunished? I want you to take off your sweater. Faster! Excellent. We'll go down to the post. (wind howling) - Mom, what are you doing? Jake! Get out here! Mom? - I miss them. Tye was just a baby. (indistinct chatter) - I know. I know, Mom. - Did you find out any more about Perseverance's children? Where they are... - We're getting closer. They were adopted out. You knew that. They're in the States. I told you that last week. - Mom. - You said that. I know you said that. - Mom. Mom. You have to come down now. You can come down. - Mom! (Aline): I think I'm losing my balance. I think I've lost my balance. I want to fall. Perseverance is not missing. She's dead. Her face... Her beautiful face. - Let's go inside, Momma. It's cold out here. - Mom, please. (♪♪) - I wish your father was here. (wind howling) (crow cawing) - Did you think you were above everything? - No, Sister. - Did you think your actions would not have consequences? - No, Sister. (gasps) (grunts) (breathing heavily) (screaming) - You are not above me. You are just another worthless Indian in the dirt. Let's see how special you are when you can't play your piano. You think you're untouchable, but God sees everything, and he can get to you. (footsteps approaching) Father. - Shh. - Father, she tried to... - She's only an Indian, but she was a special Indian. A child prodigy. (in French) She was a symbol that what we are doing here in this residential school is above others. (Aline breathing heavily) From a savage to a world-class pianist. Such a possibility existed. But now... - Aline? Aline! (breathing heavily) - Aline! Aline! (tense music) (laboured breathing) - She has two broken ribs from the fall, and her hand... - What about her piano? - I'm sorry. - I won't be able to play? - You have other talents. God takes one thing away... and gives another. I know... you are hurting, Aline, but you must watch your language. (cracking) (screaming) - Adam, are you getting dressed? - I am dressed. Every Sunday, you get dressed, and our children get dressed. All so pretty. And every Sunday, you ask me the same question. Are you getting dressed? Don't ask me again. (water rushing) What are you going to do when they touch your precious babies? (birds chirping) I asked you a question. Dear Jesus. Dear, dear Jesus. Please help me forgive. Let them fuck me and my children, but help me forgive. (glass shattering) - Enough! - When is enough, enough? It is enough, isn't it? - Why don't you go have another drink? - You okay? Did I make you cut yourself? (speaking Cree) I'm the mad one. Okay? It's me who's mad. I can fight their goddamn wars, but I can't get a job like a man should. You want to know what an Indian man is worth? Aline, I'm talking to you. You want to know what I'm worth? My eye and my leg... are worth 300 dollars. The government wants to pay me 300 for my eye and my leg. They took away my Indian Status because I joined the war, but I can't be a citizen of Canada because I'm an Indian, so I don't get any veteran pensions. Three hundred f... (scoffs) I guess that's what happens when you think the war is over. (soft music) Don't go. Don't go now. Stay with me. - We'll pick up a few things from the store, be home by noon. (door closes) - Fuck me. Fuck them. (soft music) (man on TV): As a result of this, we can let them abolish the Indian Act and make them citizens of Canada like everyone else. But we've learned in the process that perhaps we were a bit too theoretical, we were a bit too abstract, we were not... - Okay, James. We're going to get you now, okay? Together. Be careful. (man on TV): You've said yourselves it would take time. It will take time. But in order to reach some kind of agreement, we have to trust each other a little bit. (TV chatter continues) (James mumbling) (James stammering) - In... Indian? - Come on. (TV chatter continues) (man on TV): There is no way that we are going to give up... especially when we are threatened with cultural genocide. - Yesterday, Indian Affairs Minister Jean Chrétien refused to commit government funds and support to a national Indian committee that would look at the state of Indian rights and treaties. - Can you turn the damn politics off? It's giving me a headache. Sorry, Father. (chuckling) Still got that potty mouth. (chuckling) Aline can do it. Sit for a minute, dear. Whoever heard of a Red Paper? Indians, that's who! Indians think they can get everything for nothing when all we ever do is bend over backwards trying to give you people everything that we have worked for. - Trudeau was just in New Zealand dancing with the Maori. Did you see that? He's quite the character. I think he might have come to a new understanding of what Aboriginal means, and I think Chretien just adopted an Inuit boy. Maybe this will somehow help to bridge... - What are your children up to, Aline? You have a son and a daughter, I understand. Did you ever have any dreams for yourself other than wiping my father's old ass? Sorry, Father. I'm always saying that I'm sorry. You can speak freely here. - Hmm. My daughter, Taylor, graduates this week as a lawyer from Queens, and my son, Jake, just got accepted into the Royal College of Art in London. Myself, I wanted to be a concert pianist. But... life makes decisions for us, doesn't it? I work as a housekeeper during the day. And then, I come here and I wipe your father's old ass at night because us Indian people, we've been trying to clean your shit up for decades. (♪♪) (upbeat music playing) Jake, honey, will you grab the champagne? - Yup. - Ah, Mom, it's so beautiful. I feel bad we have to cut it. - I don't. I want to eat it all. (laughing) - When we were younger, we were only allowed to have one piece each, but I think you'll have the whole thing to yourself. - Uncle Jake! - They're just jealous. (chuckling) - To my daughter, the lawyer. Your dad would be so proud of you. I'm proud of you. You did it. - I did it because of you, Mom. - We better cheers before someone starts crying. (phone ringing) - Percy, you can just leave it. - It's my turn. (laughing) - She'll run off the sugar. (footsteps pattering) - What was my grandfather like? - Like you. Fierce. And smart. - It's going to be alright. - I don't want anything bad to happen to you. You don't let anyone hurt you. You promise? - I promise. Can you write it for me? In Cree. Mom said you know how, that it's buried inside of you. - She said that, did she? Play something for me, will you? You're going to be an amazing piano player. Just like your Kokum. (classic music playing) - You smell good. - You smell like you've been drinking for two days. - That's because I have been drinking for two days. Which you already know. I think you want to say more. You want to say... I look handsome despite myself. - I do, that's what I want to say. You good? - Better. Let off some steam. - Do you want some breakfast? - Stay right here, love. Just like this. Me and the boys didn't finish cleaning up 'cause, you know, we got carried away. So I'll finish, be back in a jiffy. We'll start the day off right. Just keep playing. I love you just like this. (playing piano) You look so beautiful. (insects chirping) (clucking) (horse grunts) (♪♪) - Good morning! It's time to get up! Come on! Good morning, sleepyhead. Hello! I'll make pancakes! With blueberries. - Boo-berries... - Blueberries. - Boo-berries. - Yeah! Does that sound good? (voice whispering in Cree) - Ted? You guys still here? - Boo-berry. (voice whispering in Ayajuthem) - Hey, there. I don't think you should be here. (voice speaking Ayajuthem) (Young Adam): Grandmother's prayers stayed with me... (praying in Ayajuthem) but so did everything else. (in Ayajuthem) Come now, Adam. You can walk with Joseph. (praying in Ayajuthem) - Tears won't do you no good here. You're gonna see things you'll never forget. You gotta keep it inside you. - Come along, boys. I'll take you to the school. (Young Adam): It's in you. You're going to hurt them. - I love them more than anything. - Doesn't mean you're not going to let it leak out. Joseph did. He couldn't handle it, how can you? - I'm a man. - They made him beat other kids. They made him hurt you. - I would never do that. - You say that, but you're still with me. I didn't feel anything when I saw him, but... - Relief. We were relieved. - What kind of monsters are we to feel that? (ominous music) (car door closes) - Adam! (wind howling) (ominous music) Adam! Adam! (sobbing) - Mom? - Please, Adam! (sobbing) (thudding) Please, please, Adam! Adam! You said we would do this together! You said we would do this together! Honey, please! - Mom? - No! Stay. Stay. Stay there. (soft music) (reporter): It's a historic day, and years in the making, but finally, residential school survivors from Canada are here in Rome, Italy, to tell their truth about what happened at residential schools to their people. Friday is the general audience with the pope where hopefully all of the stories and all of the information that he's heard from the delegates this week will make a difference. And we'll be here to cover more stories as we go through the week. (soft music) (church bell chiming) (in Italian) His Excellency would like to ask if any of the residential school survivors would like to take this opportunity to speak or be heard by His Holiness. (indistinct chatter) (clears throat) - My mother would like to speak in her language, our language. Cree. I will translate for her. (speaking Cree) My name is Aline Spears, I am from the Cree Nation in Manitoba, Canada. I am 86 years old. (speaking Cree) I would like to ask if Cardinal Thomas Miller is the same Cardinal Thomas Miller who was the head of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse in Canada. (speaking Cree) Then The Holy See on sexual abuse here at the Vatican, and now the Vatican Treasurer. - Yes, that is correct. Cardinal Thomas Miller. (Aline speaking Cree) - I first knew him as Thomas Miller, a 17-year-old piano teacher at the residential school I attended. (speaking Cree) (wings fluttering) Then as Deacon Miller, then as Father Thomas Miller. (speaking Cree) (voice breaking) Then as the man who sexually abused me... at 16... and impregnated me. (soft piano music) (tense music) - My turn. (gasps) (whimpering) (bird cooing) (soft music) - Are you alright? - I'm fine, just tired. - You should get some sleep. - You should get some sleep. I don't want to talk about it. - I wasn't going to ask. - You were. I'm ready to go home. - I know. I know you are. You did good today. (baby crying) (breathing heavily) - I want my baby. Give me my baby. - He was born... stillborn. - You heard him crying. He's alive and you know it. - He's dead to you. It's better this way. - For who? - I don't know. - Where will they take him? - They will take him and bury him down by the river. - I will tell someone. I will tell anyone who will listen. (grunts) - Do you think anyone would believe you? - If the future can be erased by the stamp of a boot... (Aline): Why would you let them? How could you let them? - I didn't have a choice. - You're a woman. - A child who's had a child makes you a child no longer. We're both prisoners of our own circumstances. - Is that how you see it? Is that how... you make it alright? - I'm sorry. If that's what you need to hear. I am sorry about everything. - I don't need your sorrow. I need your protection. You... owe me that. You know he'll come at me again. - You are an Indian. I don't owe you anything. And even if I did, how can I protect you when I can't even protect myself? - You took my protection away when you broke the bones in my hand. - I knew that. I knew that. (♪♪) (insects chirping) - I'm so tired. (grunts) - You're almost there. You'll go the rest of the way yourself. - Where am I going? - You'll know soon enough. (engine revving) (birds chirping) Shh... Let's get you cleaned up. (sniffling) (singing) (sobbing) (soft music) Sixteen is the youngest we can take them in, even with parental consent. - She's 16, for sure. - We have a train leaving tonight for Montreal. She'll be in basic training there. We could get her on that if that's not too early. - That's perfect. (thunder rumbling) - I don't want to go. I want to stay... with you. And see Dad and Perseverance and Johnnie. - I want those things too, but the only way we can make sure they don't send you back to that school is to send you to war. It's funny, eh? You promise me that you won't look back... for us? You're not being selfish, my girl. We need you to because... you are our tomorrow. Hmm? - Will you be here when I get back? - Your Dad and me will always be here. - No, I mean be here, be here. - I'll see what I can do. (thunder rumbling) - There's nothing left to see. We are not us... without them. They are not them... without us. - Mom! (train rattling) - Lina, take this. (sighs) There's gonna come a time when your life is so perfect... and you'll feel the darkness and it'll threaten to take it all away. You don't let it. You don't let them win. You be everything that you are meant to be. Promise me. Promise me! - I promise. (man shouting) (Aline): You remind me of her, my mother. - People say I remind them of you. (chuckles) (phone ringing) - I wanted to see you before I left. That was... quite the dramatic reunion. They are placing me on leave. I am flying back to Canada tonight. To face the music, as they say. Even if I am charged, even if I am convicted... of sexual abuse, the church council will likely drag it out. And with any luck... I will be dead by then. Or we both will be. A surprising bit of grace offered at this old age. Was there not one good thing we gave you at residential school? Not one ounce of goodness that came from it? Surely, you learned something from us that sustained you in your life. - What I've learned from defending Indigenous survivors... who were defenseless children... is that they might have lived in poverty, but they knew love. What you taught them... was an education in unrelenting cruelty. Of course, it's you. Her daughter. The lawyer. What are you now? - A Truth and Reconciliation Commissioner. - You must have been just like her when you were young. I can see it in your face. Did she ever play again, piano? - Yes. (scoffs) - Of course she did. She could have been... - She could have been a lot of things. But what she was, and is, is an amazing mother. What did you do with the child? How did you make him disappear? - I don't know what you are implying. What kind of monsters do you think we are? (laughing) - Do you really want me to answer that? - He was adopted. By a family who couldn't conceive. - How Christian of you. I would imagine there are no records? One more thing, Your Eminence. The Indian Residential School Settlement is only the beginning. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is gathering the voices of all the residential school survivors. So that old age and time will offer you little grace. Your name will live on as the sexual molester you are, and as the protector of serial child abusers. Your life's work. Enjoy your flight. - I've said all I've come to say. You know everything about me. Well, not everything, but you know. Are we done here? - We'll just take your mic off. - Oh, right. - Is there anything we haven't asked that you would like to tell? I think the story goes on. - Taylor, bring me my purse there by my coat. - You can give it to her, it's fine. What do we have here? It looks like a music score. - It's a song, that's a map. It's the only way we could record it without them knowing. The staff are the banks of the river, except they are curved. Bass clef is South, treble is North. Half notes are trees. Whole notes is... is where... they... they buried him. The breath mark is where we thought they buried others. - Who is "him"? - It's where they buried my brother, Tye. When he was eight. When we tried to run away. (wind howling) - Mom. Mom. - Yes, I can hear. - Sorry. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. - I want to go home. - I know, Mom. - I'm... I'm tired. This whole thing has tired me out. My whole life has tired me out. - We can just sit for a minute. (sighs) - You should get married. - What? Where'd that come from? You should get married. - You never know, I just might get a new man now that I'm 86. (laughing) - A rich family member would be nice for a change. You'd take a hit for the team. (laughing) - There's so many things I didn't know. - I didn't want you to carry more than you already did. You were always so serious, taking care of all of us. You are my voice. You... You are my dream. - Jake? - My fire. - Grandad? - My love. - Those we have lost? - My marrow. My bones. Our bones. - You sound different. - How? - You sound like you're saying goodbye. (Aline): We don't say goodbye. We say nikawapamitin. - Nikawapamitin. (Taylor): Okay, let's go get ready for Percy's concert.

(woman): I went to the residential school, transported, you see, in that truck. It looked like a cattle truck. (man): All of my siblings, we all went in together. The priests and nuns came and my brothers went that way, and my sisters went that way, and I never seen them again. - The residential school system took away my language, my culture... And my identity. - Mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse that I witnessed here, no amount of money, no counselor can ever take that away from my mind. - And then they scrubbed us down with disinfectants like we were diseased little animals. - Sometimes, they would get so sick from the food that they ate, you know, that they would vomit. (man 2): The staff and the supervisors were being fed bacon and eggs that was delivered to them at the head of the dining area and they would sit there like kings and queens. (woman 2): The residential school was like being in jail. (man 2): A life in prison for a crime you did not commit. And my only crime was being born Indian. - They didn't teach us love. They taught us fear. I remember being awakened and taken out of the room... and then being sexually abused by the priest. (woman 3): The residential school kills feelings in you. The old saying, you beat the Indian out of the child? Sometimes, you beat the humanity out of the child. - The priests and the nuns... failed us as Indian children put into their care. Very badly. They were the problem. I wasn't. We weren't the problem as children. (reporter): The Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified 3 200 deaths of children in residential schools, but the real number is higher. So many records are lacking. The chair of the commission Murray Sinclair has said the number of children who died could be as high as 6 000. - But I don't want to look at being a survivor, I want to be a warrior towards justice and wellness and healing.
