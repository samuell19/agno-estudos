- Good morning, Zé Almino. - Morning! - How's it going? - Ah... Middling day, you know? - Did you manage to fetch the tent? - No, not yet. It's been hard to find it. I don't even know how I'm gonna find it. Donana de Lara. Nice to meet you. Rafael Quelene. Are you here for the celebrations? I've just arrived. Zeca, my son, what happened? You love coffee. Hey, ma'am! Hey ma'am... Please... If you could have a word... - Who are you? - You don't remember me? I was the one who introduced the foreigner to you, ma'am. Mr. Rafael. I'm from Macaia... And my name is Zé Almino. I don't remember. But the other day, at the church, you promised me a tent for the celebrations. It's still early for the celebrations. Did you say Macaia? It's a poor place. Just outside of Ubá. So it won't be hard to reach you there. You just wait, sir. I'll keep my promise. What happened? Was the sun too strong? I'll get your hat. Look. It's for our return, when the dew falls. How beautiful the roses are. Zeca, we need to fix this gate. Don't you want to draw cards? No. It's a childhood thing, right? I have a relative like that. He was born that way. He must be a lot of work. These are trials God sends us. It is He who knows the reasons for all things. God... If there's a God, he's probably watching me right now. Pushing a wheelchair around on a dusty road in Minas. There is a God... But He can't see me. And he doesn't care what I do either. Look, Zeca! Look at the view. Beautiful, isn't it? What have I done? God... God... What have I done? What's done is done. Look there! The sky, Zeca. There... There... There! What do you, who's from a big city, know about the small rural town where I was born and raised? About poor folks like me? What do you know about the country roads? About the forest, the dust, the sky and the river? What do you know about me, about my faith? What do you know, Rafael? You want it! You want me to kiss you. You want me to bite you. You say yes and no at the same time. You don't know what love is. I'm out of here. Rafael! Don't go, Rafael! Don't go! Rafael! ZECA'S BIRTH Good lord! How awful! What will I say to my husband? Go away! All of you! I don't want to be pitied. I don't need your pity. Zeca... Zeca! - A good man! Only wanted the good of the people. - He was murdered, God! How terrible! HIS FATHER'S DEATH Poor Donana! Politics! That's why he was killed. - He wanted good! He only did good! - The man was always helping the poor! God Almighty! What will become of us without this man? Murderers! Ignorant men! To kill such a man! God Almighty! On your feet, hungry folks of the Earth! The flame already consumes the idea AMNESTY OF 1945 Of the crude crust underground. Well, united let us make, In this final fight, A land without masters The International! Well, united let us make, In this final fight, A land without masters The International! On your feet, O victims of hunger! On your feet, hungry folks of the Earth! The flame already consumes the idea... Córporis mystérium Sanguinísque pretiósi Quem in mundi prétium Fructus ventris generosi Rex effudit gentium Amen. Pange, lingua Gloriosi Corporis mysterium Sanguinisque pretiosi Quem in mundi pretium Fructus ventris generosi Rex effudit gentium I'm free! Free! No husband! No son! Free! It was all an accident. If anyone asks me, that's what I'll say. It was all an accident. No one will think I threw the chair. I just got rid of it. And in time, I'll forget he ever existed. That he was my son. That he was named Zeca. Will it be him? Rafael? Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me for everything I've done. I know what I want. I only wish to live... To live... To live... But I know I'm nobody. And I'm to blame for my sins. Forgive me, Lord. Forgive. That's how I'm made. I'm no good. And I don't want to be better than I am. Forgive me. The vultures! But I can't go back there now. What if someone finds out before I talk to the deputy? What will people say? No... I'll be there first thing tomorrow. It would be foolish to go there now. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, I said. What is it? Don't you like to greet others? Good afternoon. Now's better. But where do you come from... So distressed? There's no one around. You have beautiful rings on your fingers. And in the hair... I like it. I saw you passed by earlier today pushing a wheelchair. - Are you from around here? - No. I came from a distant place. - May I know where? - No. - But, back to the wheelchair... - My son. I left him there. In a relative's residence. We'll see about that later. I found what I saw very odd. Good afternoon. Take me... Take me wherever you want. I don't have a son anymore. No trouble at all. Rafael... Rafael... Let's run away together and live a new life. You don't look so good. What is it? You should talk to the doctor. Yes... I'm not feeling good at all. I'm... I'm really tired. I need help, Juca. Shouldn't we bring Inacia's daughter here? Sinhá must be older by now. She can be very useful here. Leave the girl there... I told you, this girl here will only bring disgrace. But I can't stand her stepfather who mistreats her. Inacia is my only sister, she's been asking so much. Juca... That would be a huge favor. I'm not asking you for anything besides that. Here is Inacia's daughter. Sinhá! I'm so glad you're here! Oh, Sinhá! Oh, Juca, thank you! Thank you so much! Come, Sinhá, come! We have everything you need here, Sinhá. It's a poor, modest house, but it's home to a decent family. Here you can get rid of that bastard of a stepfather of yours, my dear. I feel so sorry for Inacia. She's a very good woman, child. Believes in everyone. God, Sinhá... Look how you've grown, got all pretty! Look, I'll sew you some beautiful clothes! I want you to be very happy here with us, Sinhá! JUCA DO VALE FUNERAL GOODS You wanted the girl, she's here. She'll be a lot of work. Don't say I didn't warn you. She's a good girl. She'll help us, you'll see. I live there. Funeral goods? How can you live in a house that sells such morbid goods? Let me see your hand. Don't do this. From what I've seen, not everything is lost yet. Your hands, my girl, were made for sweeter work. God! You get angry easily! Told you. She's already dating around. A sly girl, that's what she is! I'm nothing but a country hick. I don't know what you want or what you are and you just come and talk to me like that on the street. I just wanted an information. But I ended up liking you. I wanted to know where Donana de Lara lives. It's in the city. A big house, the tallest one. Let go of me! Can't you see my aunt is watching? She keeps spying on you like that? What do you want from me? I don't know anything, can't do anything... - Let me go. - Promise me. Promise me you'll meet me tomorrow. I can't. I won't let go of you, then. Promise. Promise. Then I'll come. You wait for me and I'll come. When? Tomorrow afternoon. There's no use. What God puts, He also puts away. This girl will stay with me, helping me. I'll take good care of her. I always wanted to get rich because I lived in poverty. My father was a carpenter too, he taught me the craft. He used to build chairs with turned legs, art furniture... But the merchants exploited him, who remained increasingly poor and miserable. And, his customers, increasingly rich. I make coffins. Death is equally certain for the rich and the poor. Where should I put them? Up there! Sinhá, you have no shame! But what did I do? I didn't do anything. Who's that man? Why did he hold your hand? - He didn't hold my hand. - Ah! As if I hadn't seen... I saw it from the balcony! Your uncle saw it too, we saw it together! Who's that man? Answer, Sinhá! I don't know who he is or where he came from. I don't know. How come you don't know? I don't. And there's no point in ragging on me. All he said was that he wanted to know where Donana de Lara's house was. Jesus Christ! So he's a foreigner. Everyone here knows where Donana de Lara's house is. He said he'd be back tomorrow. Place an order. I have an emergency order for tomorrow morning. Who died, Juca? I told you I don't like you asking me whose coffin I'm building. Sinhá! Sinhá, my child, your soup is getting cold! I need you to help me. How did my dad die? Oh! The family reunited! Sinhá, Sinhá! Where were you, girl? Didn't you hear me? What is it, Auntie? Juca needs help, he's working nights. Sinhá. So you don't want to tell me, right? You don't trust me, do you, Sinhá? I am your aunt! If I talk, Sinhá, it's because it's very different from your hometown here. There are evil people here, Sinhá, who want nothing but other people's harm. - Auntie, I told you everything... - No you didn't, Sinhá! Do you need me? Get some cloth to cover the lid. American, louisine or merino. Louisine. It's virgin, right? Yes... The fabric can be white. You know why you came from your town, don't you? But relax, you'll never leave here, ever. At least as long as you behave. I had noticed when you were with that man... You are already a woman, and a very beautiful one. You don't have to be afraid of me, girl. I don't want to hurt you. I just haven't seen enough of you... If you're nice to me, you can have anything you want: Dresses, ribbons, even money... Now... She doesn't need to know anything. And it's just a hug that I want. What you think I want? It's just a hug... What is it? What happened? You're drunk! You've been drinking since morning. I'll make both of you pay for this! Drinking like this is a sin! God punishes! Oh, mother... My hometown... When in the sky, the sun goes hiding And in my chest, the pain is growing It's the longing that makes me weep In the voice of a bell, in the moonlight How I still remember Your sad eyes crying In the sad farewell I gave you I saw that I was unhappy, I couldn't love Only because my fate was doomed! I went far away And then, alone, still sad and hurt, I made for my loved one, Also lonely and scorned, From the chapel, the sad old bell When the sun goes down, we'll go to the hill. It's him! Liked it? So pretty... Gorgeous. Gorgeous? And what about... This rosary? Beautiful. Well, I have fabrics too... Silk brocade. - It's nice... - Nice... And I also have... Some lace. Lace is always marvelous. Muslin fabric... What about it? Can I see it? So... Delicate. Beautiful... And finally... Postcards. - Can I see? - Yes. My father wore his hair like that. - Rather pretty, aren't they? - Yes! You're gonna sell all that during the celebrations? There must be a lot of fun in your life. A traveling salesman's life. From town to town. No landing on... Free... Owing to the unknown. I'm not a routine person. I like to live. You know? I, on the other hand, am the product of... A hopeless evil. I never had a childhood. I'm a person shaped by absences. What do you lack? Perhaps... My husband. I heard he was murdered. Yeah, he was a politician... His ideas were far too advanced for this small town. He was an idealistic man. - Poor Donana... - Please... I don't need anyone's pity. - Do you want me to leave? - Oh no! No, no... That's not it. If you only knew how good this conversation is for me. I am a lonely woman. This conversation gives me... New strength. I would like to continue it. Perhaps in the garden. Rafael. You... Now's better. But I completely understand what you're complaining about. I'm not complaining about anything. The gentleman is... You. You're mistaken. Complaining is perhaps not the term. What do I want? To live. But who doesn't want it? Not this way. That's not how you want to live. I don't know why you say that. I do not want and do not intend to live differently than I do. It is the substance of your own life that is different. You only want to live, but to live of what you imagine life to be. I mean... It can't be, it doesn't exist, it can't exist. It exists. The imaginary... The dream... The desire... I don't know if it's right. I'd like you to tell me how. I can. But with one condition? Which? - It's late, I must go back to my chores... - The condition is... Tell. That it isn't here. Let it be in your home. In the afternoon, then. After lunch. In the afternoon. After lunch. I have a visit to make this afternoon. I'm afraid. No, we're not going to the hill today. Something happened. Who is this man? I don't know what to do. Some other time, Zeca. When it is possible, we'll go to the hill. As I recall, you complained about not having a childhood. Yes. That was it. But it's not true. It is not childhood that you lack but maturity that you lose. And you know it. Maturity? What is this? Wait. Do you think that there is a limited time to live? A deadline in life... - It's the existence... - Oh, sorry, I got lost. I can't understand it. It's not that hard. I'm just saying you want to live... And you're afraid of it. Ah, that's true, I'm scared to death. - And what if my fear... - Your refusal. What if my refusal had a fair... reason? No! That's why you don't live as you'd like. You've built a wall between yourself and others, between yourself and the world. Who told you? How did you know about my son? It was easy to see. I felt there was something, but I didn't know what it was. Or that I was behind the curtain. How was it possible, my God? I want to die... Die. See... Look. Look how beautiful you are. Look. You can still have the world at your feet. If you knew of my disappointment... Of my marriage... Of the long days of silence... Of abandonment. If you only knew the weight of my resignation. What you lost... What you never had... Now you'll find with me. - And then? - What does it matter? If you want... We'll run away. We'll go far. We'll go to another city. You're on time. I like it. It's beautiful! You've never seen a waterfall? No? Not even a cascade? It's beautiful! Really beautiful! Now all that's left for you to see is the sea! - The sea? - The sea! The sea is immense, with water on all sides. - Let's take a bath in the waters? - How? It's easy, easy. You just need to take off your shoes... Your socks... Just like that... Oops! Pull up your pants... Come on, girl, you can take off your dress. - No! - Yes, come on! Come on! - Try to follow me, come... - No, I can't swim! It's easy, the waters are not deep, come! Come, girl! Wait, Rafael! Come! You can wear your dress, come! Sinhá, you took too long. Look, I don't want this to happen again. If this happens again, I swear, I'll send you back home. Lord Almighty! Can't you pay attention to what you do? It costs money and money doesn't grow in the backyard! You slug, wake up! Rafael... What's up with you? What do you want from me? You still don't know? You don't even know me yet. There are other things I've known for a long time. It means very little to me. How can I matter to you, a handsome big city man? You matter a lot. You don't know how much. You don't know... But you're very pretty. And make me lose my mind. Are you always like this? Do you always say things like that? You're too serious for your age. Everything is serious. There is great seriousness in my being here. You'll see how good it is. Just a kiss, please? Leave it there, I don't need any help today. I... I... - I just need to know who that man is. - Who? Rafael. How do you know his name? You were the one who said it when you broke the plates. His name... The man I know. You know everything, don't you? I... I... I don't know, I... I can't even see you anymore. It's like I've got the devil inside of me. - You want me to leave? - Leave? No! No... - Maybe it's better... - No, no. It's not the case. - But you... - That day... Under the shower, remember? I saw your body, naked. I did. I... I could bear anything, anything... Even to... Even to... To know you hate me. I don't! Even if you do, what difference does it make? I could bear anything but knowing that you... That there is another man, that you belong to another man. You want me that much? Promise that you will never belong to another man. I promise. No one has ever kissed me. And no one will ever kiss me like that. Today we have to work all night. There's an order for tomorrow morning. - Is it for the old man? - No it isn't, it's for a very young girl. A girl that is... Exactly your size, just like you. It's close to Mr. Terto's place. You don't know Mr. Terto. Mr. Terto is a salesman who lives... Over there in Fundão. His store is very beautiful. I used to go there, visit every Sunday. I haven't been there for a long time. It's been quite sad. Besides, there are a lot of beautiful things there for you to buy. Ah, if you only knew what you mean to me. - I know. - Please never leave me. - You are all I have. - I won't leave you. You promised, you promised you would never belong to another man. - I did. - You swear? I do. Women don't know how to love. I kiss you and you don't react. You look cold, sexless. Is that what love is to you? No... For me, love isn't that. For me love is a strange and light thing. Like a red flower that flies. A red flower flying? Look... Look how different he is from the others. Those are hillbilly girl thoughts. I'm telling you I'm gonna take you to the big city, that we are going to travel by plane. You need to grow up! To become a real woman! You may be a a special little bird. But you're still vulnerable like the rest of the bunch. There's a louisine cut ready to be measured. - Rafael, where are you? I can't see you. - Baby, I'm lost again. I didn't ask. I don't want to make this trip, but I have to leave now. - I'm not feeling well. - I don't know what you have, Anita. Nothing... It's nothing. Stop with this nonsense, we're gonna end up missing the train, Anita! - I'm not going anymore, it's no use! - I don't understand you! I'm tired of these travels! And besides, there's no use in going. Your heart would never see me. There's no place in it for anyone else. It's useless, Raphael. Anita... You're a bastard, Rafael. You don't love me and you don't know what love is either. You just want to have fun and take advantage of me. Okay. If that's how you see it, we'd better not see each other anymore. Goodbye. I have to go, I have another appointment. Don't go, Rafael! Don't go! Come here. Let me go, Rafael. Leave me alone, please. If you want to see me, I'm staying right there in that hotel. You know what I want. You're evil, Rafael. You don't feel sorry for others. Did you call me to say that? Goodbye then. If you need... Come... You'll like it. Palace Hotel Don't forget it. Rafael, don't leave me! Madam Donana de Lara. I just found out. My condolences. But sit down, please. I don't know how it happened, deputy. I thought I was close. It all happened when I went to look the view on the other side. The view? You left your son alone? It wasn't the first time. So he triggered the chair by himself... Actually, mister deputy, I don't know. I can't imagine how it happened. Next thing I knew, the wheelchair was rolling over the... - The cliff... - You're not feeling well. Want a glass of water? A glass of water. Please sit down. You... - I'm sorry about all the details, but... - No, you don't have to apologize. I know these things are necessary. I'm... I'm feeling better. I'm sorry. We used to go to that slaughterhouse hill all the time. It's not a nice view... It's rather sad... Ugly. But I dread to be pitied. Zeca seemed a little agitated today. But... Was there no one, ma'am? - No one who could help you? - Not a soul. It's a secluded place, you know. Yeah... I know. But why just now? I mean... At three o'clock in the morning, you come and tell me this. Mister Deputy... You seem to forget about the suffering of a poor mother who just lost her child. Ah, but please, that's not what I meant. So far, I've been looking for friends. Looking for help. What do you think I was doing? I looked by the stream. It was dark, I got lost. It was so dark! I was afraid. Terrified! TRAVELERS' HOTEL SERRATO BUTCHER SHOP SWINE AND BEEF What attracted your attention to the other side? A gentleman. A gentleman? And who was it? Everyone knows each other around here. Didn't you recognize the gentleman? - You really don't know who it was? - No. It was quick. Well, actually... It doesn't matter much to the whole story... Anyway, it'd be interesting to know what you saw at the time of the incident. Of the accident. Of the incident of the accident. Well... I don't remember correctly. He appeared to be a bearded man. WANTED - CHICO HERRERA Maybe he was waiting for someone because he wasn't moving, he was always in the same place. He seemed to ride well. He dominated his beautiful patient horse. - Who's that? - CHICO Herrera. A crook who's... Robbing the rich, but, fortunately, far from here. But don't worry. I will arrest him. He's been around... Fortunately, for you.. The case boils down to very little. There's been an accident, and you want our cooperation. Mr. Deputy... Do you want to add anything else, ma'am? The body. Oh, the body. Of course. I forgot about it. We have to send for your son's body. Today. Because of the late hour, we'll have to wait for dawn. But don't you worry, ma'am. As soon as it's dawn, we'll pick him up. But why? The vultures... How could I not have thought of the Palace Hotel before? A traveling salesman hotel. Of course Rafael must be in it. Very close to where the parties are going to take place. Come on up! Come! I thought you were a guest. I'm sorry about the hour, but I must talk to someone who's staying here, it's urgent. And who is this? A man called Rafael. A traveling salesman. He's here for the celebrations. Rafael Quelene? Exactly. He's out. And maybe he won't sleep here at the hotel today. You know how these travelers are, don't you? But if you'd like to leave a message... Yes. Please. I am Donana de Lara. I know. And I'm Rosália da Luz. Tell him... Tell him I'm at my house, waiting for him. My son has died. I'll be waiting for him at the funeral. I'm ready. She's probably from another town. And she's poor. A dreadful thing, my friend. Looks like they found the boy's body completely butchered by vultures. Think of your patroness saint. Think of Our Lady of Sorrows. Be calm. We should call a doctor. It's you. Come. It was dreadful. I got your message at the Hotel. I came as soon as I could. It was horrible, Rafael... I've been looking for you all night. Ah, why couldn't all these intruders be wiped out? False, pure hypocrisy... I wish I could relive, in this very minute, that little madness that took hold of us. Why should I put up with all this and listen to the nonsense things they say? And the unbearable smell of domestic animals they exude... Wouldn't you rather get some rest? Oh, Rafael... Oh how I waited for you. I've been looking for you everywhere - All night long... - But what is this? What do you intend? Are you insane? Insane? Me? Oh, Rafael... You can't, you simply don't have the right to say this to me. No! No! No! Zeca's body is coming! Rafael... Oh Christ... What will become of me? Take me away! Take me away! Isn't that what you promised me? Rafael! Come back. Come back to yourself, Donana. Behave. - Can't you see it's time? - Time? Time of what? It doesn't matter. Wasn't it all an arrangement? Didn't we plan, together, what's happening now? What plan? We planned the crime. - The murdering of my son. - You're insane. Completely insane. That never crossed my mind. You promised me! You promised me my life... My freedom... My wish... You said you'd run away with me to another city. Rafael? There is a God... I believe in Him. No, there is no God. God does not take part in this blind game called human existence. I hate you... I hate you! I hate you! You were the only witness. And you let that happen. Allowed him... To rape the girl. Zeca's sacrifice... My complete and utter abandonment... I hate you. I hate you... Ah, I hate! Hate! I hate! If there was no God... The weight of nothingness would crush my tired shoulders. Forgive me... My Lord. Forgive me. She was supposed to be here by now, where did that girl go? Good God! I shouldn't have had this girl brought here. But for other reasons! Of course, a drunken, lecherous old man wouldn't be good company for a girl in her prime. It's not that, I need the girl for the job. No one died... There's no orders! What would the difference be? No one died? Don't worry, Juca. As soon as she shows up, she'll be sent back straight to her mother's. Madam Donana de Lara. Did something go wrong? No, thank you. But that's not the issue that brings me here. - Perhaps you don't know me. - I do. Perhaps you don't know my name. Dona... Donana de Lara. Donana Altiva de Oliveira Lara. You certainly find my visit strange. No, I don't. However, the reason for my visit is important to me. Very important, but just for me. - I came to ask something about... - The girl? About Sinhá. Do you want to know everything? Everything. I ran, I ran all the way with my last strength... Until I reached Sinhá in the middle of the bridge. She was waiting for me, she said she was ready. There were four blows. Four blows. The body turned red with blood. But before she died, she smiled. She smiled at me with that bright smile that was all I had. And I cried, and cried... Like I'm crying now, telling you how I killed her. I couldn't even hear what Isaura was saying. I just wanted Sinhá to return. I waited for her in the shed. I started working tirelessly to make that feeling vanish. I flattened one, two, three, five, ten wooden boards... Enough to make several coffins, all the same size. Sinhá's size. It must be here. It must have been here. Your crime, Rafael. Your other crime. I want to be the first person to tell you all your crimes. Someday you'll return... You will... You will know everything. You will know how, because of you, Master Juca slit your little girlfriend's throat. Sinhá must have passed through here, with her white dress... Torn... Violated. She could have thrown herself or screamed for help... She had courage. Great courage. All quiet! Did you love her? You ask me if I loved her? What do I know about love? I'm too poor and brute. What do I know of these things? At first I didn't even want her to come. It felt like I was guessing what was going to happen. Sinhá was a very beautiful girl, she was... She was the only bright and cheerful thing in my house where I make my funeral coffins. Her smile had color. If you saw her smile... When she smiled it was like a... A rose-colored air radiated. Then she changed. It was as if something very serious was happening. When she met that man. To say that I loved her is... Is to say something that I didn't even know. I... I... I just wanted to touch her. Just touch her. To see if she slept. To get away from that bad dream. But she ran away, she ran away... Yes. I loved her. I loved her deeply. Sinhá! Sinhá, what happened? But what happened? Aunt Isaura. But you're all hurt! It was nothing, I got hurt when I arrived. But where did you get in? Through the fence, that's where I got hurt. But why did you came through the fence? I was waiting for you in the living room. I'm sleepy... - Oh, Sinhá... - Don't touch me, uncle. I'm not worth anything anymore. She promised, she swore. It wasn't her fault. He raped her. Forced her. It's his fault. Only his. - We're all guilty. - No. No. He was the traitor. He betrayed the faith of us all. That's what I'm looking for. The sign of his betrayal. Of his affront. Of his final scorn. You had courage. Great courage. But... He'll return, Master Juca do Vale. He'll return. He'll return. After that... He'll return.
