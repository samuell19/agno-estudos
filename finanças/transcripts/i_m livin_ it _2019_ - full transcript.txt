Put down that phone. Come give me a hand! To slice the ginger for me. Rely on him? He's useless, Ma! How can you slap your sister-in-law?! - When are you gonna grow up?! - Stop it! Go to hell! Sam Chai! "overwhelm me with emotions" "l can still remember the colorful scene" "The gentle breeze" "brought you into my heart" "This brief moment changed my life' "The passion that l've given..." The boss fired me out of the blue. Even the rent of my subdivided flat has risen. What has this world turned into?! "Blow, let this..." Shut up, bitch! Goddamn it, you're still singing? Had enough? What the hell? Bowen... What the hell? The boss' feng shui decoration! Who's starting trouble in here?! Everything's fine, guys! Let's keep going! What do you want to hear? Let's keep the music going! Come on... Stop right there! Stop! Hey, kid! Someone died from a mouse bite while sleeping here a few days ago. l think it was this very spot. (Food Sharing Point) lt's your birthday. l bought a birthday bun for you! Were you there to celebrate or to crash my show? They're at it again? You're welcome to watch me perform. But l've been working there for years. l know there will always be hecklers. How do l keep my job if you fight every one of them? With a personality like that, no wonder you never got famous! Bowen... The boss' feng shui plant was chosen by the great feng shui master. Jane's gonna really get it tomorrow... So what? How was l supposed to know... Before something go wrong... you should discuss it well. 2% off from internet. Sell it at 5% off now and you make $55 every dozen you sold. l ain't good with numbers, Bowen. l don't care as long as making profit. EXactly. Chatting Cheung! Where did you sleep last night? Don't get me started. Someone conned me into a shelter. l stuffed tissues in my ears, but still all over me. l ain't going there anymore! Everyone knows the shelters are covered with fleas. Why do you think people prefer sleep here instead? Say, Bowen... You got a job for me? Look... This is all l've got. A few warehouses in Kowloon Bay are holding factory sales. Many people throw away their old stuff on the spot. Search the trash collection points and public toilets. Plenty of treasure there. Kowloon Bay is miles away. lt takes forever to walk there. Go back to your seat. Meditate. Once you're in the zone... You won't feel hungry anymore. Mama! Got you some coupons! Don't worry about it. l just cut them from the newspaper. You can get them yourself next time. Thanks, Bowen! You bullied Jane! Did l? (Joyful Meal with new toys) Your skirt's shorter again? The teacher said l've grown another 3cm yesterday. Nan Nan.

Request the officer passes it to their senior directly. Don't lose it. Thank you, Bowen! Look, mommy! Put on your school bag. Thanks, Bowen! Wake up! They've got a business to run here. Can you help me to find a job? They always hire people here. But the job's so hard... Help me out. Get your stuff out of the locker before 1 0pm, or you won't be able to get it until the next day. Don't go back there before midnight. lf you've got some money, buy a burger. Be nice to them, and they'll do the same for you. lf you're out of cash, there's a fridge nearby a local store. The owner got leftovers there for those in needs. lf you need to hang laundry, don't do it openly in the restaurant. Mama leaves her clothes to dry outside and picks them up at dawn. Mama and Nan Nan know their way around. lf you've got questions and l'm not there, ask them. When l meet him...What should l say? Just say "thank you." Hey. Yan. l know you have your hands full, so l brought over someone to help you out. This again, Bowen? Hey, kid! Brother Yan. Hi, Brother Yan. l need no one. He's a bargain. He just needs enough to feed himself. Let's get to work, come on. l don't need him, Bowen! Look, you don't get it, Bowen. l'm not doing delivery anymore. lt costs a lot. l'm telling customers to come and pick up now. l get it. Take care. Call me if you need me. Just to save two hundred dollars... They could've it back from deliveries for just half day. Small victories come from individuals, big victories come from teams. Bill Gates said that. Look at how rich he became. What a drag! What do l do now? ls it the end of the world now? There's always another way. Hey. What are we waiting for? For luck to come. Aren't you? What are you looking for? Money. Pick those up and toss it in the trash... Why don't you do it yourself? Should l feed you too? Go home if you want to be comfy... That is, if you don't mind feeling embarrassed. You want to make 50 dollars for ten pairs or 50 dollars per pair? Put some soap on it, man. Brainstorming! Or you'll die from starving within a week of runaway. How do you know that l ran away from home? You have a point. Thus, you are carrying the sleeping bag for your vacations, right? Beggars can make more than us peddling shoes here. Why don't you go beg, then? Why pay me to get you a job? Check it out. How much? $70. How about $60? l'll give you $50. Let's make it $55. lt's hard to make a living. Look at this poor kid. He's so skinny. Fine, fine. - Here's $60, give me $5 back. - Great. We're eco-friendly, no plastic bags. Thank you so much! Thanks! You used me. Beggars can beg all they want. We scour, renew and promote. We're doing business here. Let's make that clear. What? At the price we charge, people know what they're getting. No such thing as an honest businessman. Do you want nothing or a bowl of rice tonight? Done. Pour it, hurry. Tape. l'm just trying to help. "Errors happen in details, success is achieved in systems." What are you saying? l can tell that you're an anti-social slacker. Studying must not be your thing. And you're so high and mighty. All you do is bullying me. Hey, kid. Do you have a talent? l have a name, man. lt's Sam Chai. - So your talent is playing games? - How about you? Your talent is talking shit? My talent? lt's fishing! You think l'd tell you that l used to have a yacht? Tape. Why do you sleep in a fastfood joint? Let's go. Jane. Bowen asked me to bring you this. Where do l put it? Oh, right here. EXcuse me, miss, do you need those stamps? Why do you ask? My pot at home is broken, miss. l want to eXchange a new one for mommy. Can you help me? Can you sell me the stamps? How much do you have? l have $1 ...$2...$2.50... Nevermind! l was just joking with you. Here you go! Thank you, miss! You're so nice! Here is all the stamps. $200, please!

Sure, Nine Fingers. Nine Fingers, the payment's good, right? So l only have two more installments to pay. Don't give me small notes anymore! Still a dimwit after all these years! Nine Fingers. ls it possible... to stop lending money to my mother-in-law? l feel sorry for you, you know. But doing that means my guys will starve. And l feel very sorry for them. Tell your so-called mother-in-law to quit gambling instead! Let's go eat elsewhere! Mommy, l'm hungry. Eat. These are for you. Enjoy. Thank you, madam. Thank you so much. l'll do it. We're all out for today. (Free Lunchbox giveaway by charity) What do we do? Didn't you hear? They're all out. Let's go! Any news from Social Welfare? Not yet. All l can do is wait. You've been waiting for years. Nan Nan has no residence registration in Mainland China. All you can get is a relative visit visa. l don't have a marriage certificate. lt's hard to get recognised here. For my daughter's sake, l'll keep fighting for it. lf you really want to do something for Nan Nan, stop paying her grandma's debts! Have you forgotten already? lt was her who denied you in the family. She kicked your daughter out from home. No matter what she's done, she's still my husband's mother. He was a loving son when he was alive. She just can't accept her son's death. That's why she drowns her sorrows by gambling. lt's hard for a parent to lose a child. And the poor woman is all alone out there. lt's good to be a dutiful daughter-in-law, but there are limits to that. l've been there before, too. You think paying someone's debts out of love will get you any gratitude? Some people have no qualms about using others. lf you're easy to be bullied, they'll keep coming back to you. lf my husband wasn't so hell-bent on registering our marriage and giving us a better life, perhaps... he'd still be alive today. Forget it, that's in the past now. Anyway... you should put yourself and your daughter first. What about you? At least l still have Nan Nan. This place is bleeding customers. lf the lounge closes down, what are you going to do? l'll think about it when it comes. Have you had dinner? Are you done yet, Mama? Just about. - Let me help you. - Done yet, Nan Nan? - Not yet. - l'll give you a hand. Thanks. Sir! Take our service for washing your car? No, thanks. lt doesn't cost much. l just had my car washed. Sir, please. Let my mommy earn some money or we have nothing for food. How much? $70! - Here you go. - Thank you! Thank you. Did he pay $70? Yeah. $20 for Mama. $20 for Nan Nan. $20 for you. l'll take $1 0. Let's work! Haven't had any food today? Neither have we. We'll all eat when we're done. lt's a fancy car! Take our service for washing your car, Sir? Let us wash your car, sir. ls that Bowen? Bowen! lt's been forever! You turned into another industry after jail? By the way, your old subordinates all work for me now. They're making just a bit more money than before. What a dick. Thanks, Martin. Looks like we can have a feast tonight. Come on. Let's get out of his way and get back to work! By the way, Bowen, your little sister... She came for a job interview few days ago. l want to help her so badly, but as you know... She's bearing a huge debt. Reputation and trust is important in our industry. You being a convicted embezzler yourself, you know what l mean, right? Have some dessert! l got you guys dessert. Have some. Bowen... You're into this type of women now? Well, with a second thought, it's quite fit you. Even wearing a suit for washing cars... That's really impressive, Bowen. Talented for washing cars than being an ass kisser. l don't want a single scratch on my ride. Have some water, okay? When will your brother visit me? He's on a business trip, he'll be home soon. He's got such a tough job... When is he coming back? He'll be home soon. Not long now. Give him a call for me. He's busy at work now, we'll... -Just call him now, hurry up... -Fine, l'll do it... l'm calling now, okay? See? l'm doing it. (Serene Finance - Wing) Hello? l'll make the payment once l find a job. Look, Wing... l've never missed my brother's debt payment in the last 1 0 years. Can't you spare me a few more days? Thank you so much. Thank you... He's in a meeting. His assistant sent some photos over for you to take a look. Here's Bowen giving a speech at the stock exchange. Wow... That's the New York Stock EXchange. He's such a smart boy... Of course, he's your son. l've got such a smart boy... Mom... Don't cry...He'll be home soon, alright? Don't cry, mom... How much for the flower lantern? $2,000. Got anything cheaper? Not for lanterns. How about spiral incense, that's $500. Or you can write a prayer on a lucky red envelope. Buddha will get the message either way. (Peace, health and fortune for my mother and sister. From Tung Ho Pok) (Peace, health and fortune for my mother and sister.) Hey. l was around the neighborhood. Just passed by say hi. Oh...here. l've never seen you wear those performance outfits, why do you put them here? What if one of the rich guys who was my fan suddenly call me up for a show? l wouldn't be able to grab an outfit in time. Has anyone called you all these years? Well...maybe l'll get a call soon. Lily has a hoarse voice. Why is she in the middle? Doesn't matter. Even a deep voice can sing gentle ballads and appreciated. What matter is how to keep the customers happy. That Ah Fa is even worse Her calves are stronger than my thighs and she gets top billing? Maybe those old guys are malnutritioned and they need someone with a little meat. She's amazing and always date those old guys for dim sum and pretends their wives don't eXist. How about the guy who thinks he's Barry Manilow? He loses his breath when singing every two lines like he's about to croak. -You mean Bill? -That's right! He can't be selling his appearance, right? At the Copa... Copacabana... Such a great voice, you should come by and perform. You're not a bad singer, you know. Do you know why you never got popular? l used to perform in five, siX venues a night. All huge nightclubs. That's what l mean. You don't gamble, no drugs or alcohol. You have infinite patience for your customers. EXcept a bit bullheaded, that's all. A military strategist once said, "A successful retreat and a glorious victory are equally worthy of praise." Hey. What's wrong with you today? You're acting odd. l'm off. We totally bought all their burgers! Hey, welcome to the banquet. - Gimme a burger. - Crazy Hey, catch! Wow, he caught it. Look at this bony guy. He must be starving. Give him one! No, two! Have another! We're all friends here, come get some. Hey, wake up! Free burgers! - Give him one! - Almost overlook you! Burgers for all! No need to thank me, guys. Hey, old geezer, why the long face? Take one, it's on me! That seat... Excuse me...that seat's taken. l like this seat. What are you gonna do about it? - Just talk it out... - Please... lf something's wrong, just talk it out... Come on, man! Come on! l'm not gonna sit here all night. Go sit somewhere else. That water. That cup of water is... That cup...cup of water is... Just buy another one! lf something's wrong, just talk it out... you should discuss it well. - We can talk it out... - So what if you've got money? Don't got here drunk and make trouble! The damn seat's taken! Why can't l sit here?! Money! l have money! Money! Get out! You're on my wife's seat! And you drank her water! Get out! Why are you getting all worked up?! What do you want? You wanna start some shit? He drank my wife's water... Actually, they're more pathetic than we are. They're the ones being stared by us like some circus performers. (Everything must go) Slow down. The boss isn't here tonight. The restaurant owner fired Bowen. He'll find an eXcuse to dock your salary for sure. How can you cover the debt payment this month? Take this. l don't need it. How about the payment? Bowen passed his part-time gigs to me. Stop being so kind to me. Just take it. Tung Ho Pok? lsn't that Bowen? lt was my first big banquet show. All my years, l'd never seen so many finance guys in one place. Remember the guy l insulted in the parking garage? A decade ago, he was all the time Mr. Tung...like that... "The heavy foolish debt in my heart" "Turns out to be owing you a life" "Endless love at the bottom of my heart" Hi everyone, if you liked Jane's performance, please show her some support? Wow! Thank you all so much... For me too? Thank you so much...This way... You're so handsome! Thanks a lot! Best luck with your business! Congratulations, everyone! Hey, Mr. Tung, if you liked Jane's performance, please show her some support. Thank you, Mr. Tung! Wish you good health and great fortune! Mr. Tung! You're amazing! With Mr. Tung leading our way, we'll all be rich! Cheers for Mr. Tung! Cheers! Share this with them. A bonus from Mr. Tung! Cheers! Two years ago, l ran into him again at the restaurant. But he didn't recognize me. He was already sleeping there every night. He'd become a different person. What's wrong? A few days work in a construction site broke you like this? No wonder Chatting Cheung didn't go with you. Can't have the job even if you want it now. All you rich guys are such dicks. That thing costs a fortune! Teach me how to play. Picked up something nice? l'm looking for jobs, really. Talk to me if you need help. Everyone's sleeping here because they're poor. But Uncle Wait is loaded. Why is he here? What do you care? Go there and ask him. Everyone has an answer, but they're all different. lt's hilarious! Hey, Jane. Oh, l left it with you. Thanks, Jane! Uncle Wait! What's up, kid? l...was worried that you'd forget to zip up again. Oh, right. Uncle Wait can't be your real name. Why do people call you Uncle Wait? Because l'm waiting for someone! That's why you don't go home at night? My place is crawling with cockroaches at night. Cockroaches? And the lift's broken tonight. What about last night? The power went out! Pick that up! Did you get an answer? Did he say the pigeons were keeping him awake? He said there was a power cut. You're such a jerk, Cheung. You know Uncle Wait can't go home because he witness his wife jumped off the window and died. Uncle Wait, come take a photo with us! lt's fun! - A photo? - Are we taking a photo? - Jane, take a photo for us! - Sure. Let's take a photo together. - We've never taken a photo together. - Join in. Come on, squeeze in. l can get all of us in. Ready... One, two, three! Did you get it? Yeah, but let's take one more. - Ready? - Cheers, guys! One, two, three! Nice. Check it out, Sam. Not bad at all. You really did get all of us in. Can you print one out for me? People still get photos print nowadays? Just do as you're told! Hey? Fine! SiX! l can arrange that. You guys want a decent meal? Of course! Got it. You need an old guy? Uncle Wait. We need one more! No problem, l got an old guy. Great, see you then. Thanks. You rascal... Mommy, you died so tragically! Mommy... - You died so tragically... - Stop laughing... Mommy, you... - Cut! - Cut! Where did you find those donkey? Sorry director, l'll take care of it. What the hell were you laughing at?! Should l just film you laughing for the rest of the night? Sorry. Sorry? You can't even play a devoted son properly?! Get your act together! Let's go again! How can an asshole like me play a devoted son? Ready, roll... Action! Guests arriving. Please pay your respects. First bow. Second bow. Third bow. Family members appreciated guests' respect. Close up! Honey...Honey... Cut! Good take! That was great, man. The director likes you! We'll call you again for next film. You two should learn from him. Can't even play devoted sons! Tomorrow l need two financial guys but playing as an asshole. Over here! He can do it. He can play that. - These two? - That's right. How do they look like that role? You two in the back!

Mom wants to hear your voice. l have an elder brother, but why l don't feel he ever exist? You just went bankrupt. Why live like this? We are family. l don't mind bearing your debt. You paid for my studies in England, after all. But mom's been waiting for you to come home. You really don't owe me anything, Bowen. lt's mom's birthday tomorrow. We'd really like you to come. Play it like this. Let's keep going. That's right. Let me help you with that. Come on. l knew that you'd be here in your spare time. Look at you. You neither buy nice food nor precious outfits. You prefer to live in subdivided flat and rent a place for these outfits. Have some water. lf you happen to see someone that you once hurt really badly, and that person wants to see you again, what would you do? l would make a decision that l won't regret. So l should go? Sometimes, if you show some... flexibility... things will suddenly make sense. He's gone. You're still staring at? He doesn't remember you anyway, and you still staying in that lounge. Does he worth it? Doesn't matter if he remembers me. he's worth it to me. Mom, have this. Mom... happy birthday. l showed up. But l didn't go inside.
