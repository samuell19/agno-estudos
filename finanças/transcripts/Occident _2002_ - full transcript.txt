Luci and Sorina Be careful. Tell me, did they give you the money? -No, but in two-three weeks will be solved, you'll see.0:01:28.0:-Two-three weeks? It has been lasting for two months by now. I don't understand what you have to lose. You go for an interview. -Don't you understand? The guy will ask me- But do you know what is advertising? And what should I say? -He will ask you, but at least he will give you money. Don't you ever want us to move away from here? -What did they do? Wait here... -Motherfucker. Do you hear me? How dare you take my things out of the house without letting me know? Did this guy bribe you to put him in my place? How are you talking to my brother? Hey, uncle Emil, come here! Fuck you, bloody thieves! -What are you doing? Are you swearing? Fuck you, bastard. -Do you regret this place now? We will sort it out. -We will sort it out... You always say that. -We will do something about it. We will go to auntie and will live there. Waiting for auntie to die, so that we can have her flat is not good either. -It would be better if we leave this place. -Where would we go? :-Anywhere. -Anywhere? Come on, it will be... :-It will be what? Don't you see they threw us in the street and you can't do anything about it? Anyway, nothing could be worse than that. And somewhere else how do you think it will be? Anyway, it cannot be worse that that. -What are you doing? -I will go to my father. Please understand me, something must change. -We must work this out. What can your father do? -And now what are we waiting for? - I don't know. Maybe he will give us a sign. -What kind of sign? You won't expect him to talk. -Of course not. Maybe we will get an idea or I don't know. Something will happen. If we will be given a sign, we will realize, you'll see. -And how will we ask him? -That's what I am doing now. I will ask him mentally. -And what will you ask him? -That is my business. -What? Is that a secret? -It is not a secret, but you laugh at these things. -I won't laugh, but you don't know to raise the problem. I mean you ask in vain "Father, what should I do? Should I leave or should I go?". The man cannot answer you. You have to answer yes or no questions. You say "Dad, I want to leave. If it is a good thing for me to live, make those crows over there to fly." That is how you should do. Otherwise, the poor man cannot give you an answer. -Look, they flew away. -What? -They flew. -Wait. -I did not ask that. -Now you must... -If they fly, we should stay, right? I think he is here. -Who? -My father. -Well, if this is not a sign... Listen... -Luci? Please! Could you help me? Sorina. Gerome. -Don't you have the impression that they're looking at us? -It's true, sir. - I also have one in the bedroom. It's calming to look at them. -So I will have her here as an advertising agent. -That's good. -I owe you. -Nevermind, colonel. -Manager, there is a guy here for hiring as an advertising agent. Could he... Bring him in. -Tell me something about yourself. Your name, your occupation... -My name is Lucian Timofte, I am 29... What do I do? I work at the greenhouses in the Botanical Gardens. Well... now there are no money... practically... -And why do you want to be an advertising agent? -Well, I don't want to. My wife wants to... At my job we have not been paid for two months ...I mean the headmistress said... What headmistress? The Headmistress of Nursery number 69. -So, Mrs Julea sent you? Let's see how is Mrs Julea. -Auntie Leana! Auntie Leana! -Luci! -Hello, Gica is here? -He's downstairs to his car. -Did you come to see auntie? -Yes, but she's not answering. -Oh my God!

It's alright. -So you won't be asleep, ok? -He said you wouldn't be asleep. -So exactly when I found it, that bottle hit my head. -What about Sorina? -She's sad with all this shit. Now she keeps telling me that we should leave the country. -Well, why the hell should you stay here? You don't have a house. -It is not that simple, man. If we had left before, would have been different, To clean toilets? -Why should you clean toilets, man? You can work as a builder, I don't know. -No, man. If Nicu had arranged something for me, I would have left, but otherwise... Besides there is auntie Leana... -So what? Will you stai here for an old woman? -But she brought me up, didn't she? -I would go on a cruiseship to be a chef. $2 per hour... -But you can't swim. -It doesn't matter. You must know how to cook. -But you don't know to cook. -It doesn't matter, you will learn there. I enroled to a cooking course. Do you think she has someone else? Who? Sorina... -Give me a break. -What did you do with my furniture? -A guy with a truck came and took it. -A guy? -He came with your wife, man. -Come on, let him be. -Why should I let him be? You don't know how he is like. - Uncle Emil! -Way to go, kids! Very nice! -He is Mr. Van Horn, a guest from Belgium.

So what did you do with the furniture? -I found someone with an empty apartment and I put it there. -I spoke with auntie Leana and we can live there until we find something else. -And her? -She will live there, too. She has nowhere to go. -How should we live 3 people in a studio flat, -As you wish, but I think it is not good what you do? -What do you mean? -You should think about it? -Think about what? Do you think I am kidding?A I have to go now. -Nicu? -It's me, Luci, auntie Leana. -Ah, Luci. What are you doing there? -What do I have to do? -How should I explain? The first thing you should do is to learn the product. If you identify yourself with it, you love it so that If they love it, they will buy it. Do you understand? Go now! -OK. -Wait a minute! -Aren't you ashamed to show up here after everything -I am replacing the guy who left. I am Luci. -Mihaela. I am sorry. I thought you are Vasile. I am sorry. -No worries. Can I make a phone call? -Let's better go outside. -Hello. I want to talk to Sorina. She's not there? And don't you know where she is? Then tell her that I called and I will call again. Thank you. -What? Problems? -No, I was with Gica, a friend of mine, -Want some? -What is the matter with Vasile? -Well, problems. I say that your friend should talk to the girl. -You say so? -Uhum... -Are you sure you know what you are doing? -Yes, man. -Hello, Sorina is not here? -She's not living here anymore. She moved out. -And don't you know where she is? -She found a place, I don't know. -Pardon me. -Nicu? -It's not Nicu, auntie Leana. I am with Gica. -She called me this morning.

See this Vasile. She loves him and that's it. -Then go to the dating agency that helped Emilia to leave. -I couldn't marry her to a stranger. -Why not? Emilia, for instance, is well.

It was your case, but two days later two young officers from Securitate took it. One small and bald and the other one taller. -Oh yes! What a tough guy was the short one! He beat that guy. -So do you remember? -Of course, but I couldn't tell who are you. I think you are not the short and bad one. -No, I am the boy they beat. -That was the law, then. If you did break it... Besides, I did not hit you. -You slapped me. -I slapped you... but compared to how those guys hit... -I do not accuse you of anything. That was it... Eventually I managed to go to Germany. But then when you took me out of the room, I had blood all over my face, some broken teeth you told me you were sorry for me, that you also have kids, a girl, And then you told me you couldn't help me but if I ever would need your help later on -That was 12 years ago. -Now I need your help. -Colonel, it is the old woman again. Now she says there is a bear in her balcony. -A bear? -And what does the bear do?... Is he smoking?... Shout out loud, madam, maybe he will be scared. -People call the police as if they call their friends. Excuse me now, but I have to leave. -Hello, is he in the house now? Pass him on the phone. -This guy I told you about - Nicu... -Who was like your brother in Germany? -Yes. He left before 1989 across the Danube They had an idea about how to pass across. And these two guys had the idea of crossing the Danube using -To the left. -...and they dropped the coin who should pass first. And Nicu was the first. The other one, Lucian did not manage to pass because in the meantime the alarm started Luckily, after the Revolution he was set free. In Germany Nicu worked for me, because I have He used to drink. And one evening, last week, we were driving home. I let him drive, even if he had drunk. It was dark and raining, the car hit the parapet of the bridge and fell into the water. I was at the rear and I could get out, but Nicu... This is the coin they dropped who took one of them far away and let the other here. -Listen, I write for police magazine. What if pe publish this story of yours in the "About Life" column? -If you are interested... But will you help me? - How, exactly? -Nicu told me that if something happens to him I should look for this Lucian and tell him and to bring his things back. -But you said something about a theft. -Last night after I arrived here I stopped at the railway station to have a drink and my car was broken into. They took the luggage. Nothing valuable, though, but personal things that cannot be replaced. We'll see... -Oh, he should be careful not to rob him at the airport. -She should meet foreigners? No, I cannot agree. We'll find a good guy for her, here. This house will be hers, we'll help her with the children She shouldn't go anywhere. -You say we will find her somebody but it's not as you think. Besides, why should she stay here? -Why? -What about the house and all these things? Children should stay close to their parents, to help them. -But don't you think about the girl? -I am thinking about her. The thing with Vasile, whom we knew, did not work out, how things will be with a foreigner? -Mrs Julea's daughter is ok, she is at home, taking care of the child. -She is ok, but what about her mother? Cristina this, Cristina that, how is Cristina, let's call Cristina... Is it ok like this? -Everything is a lottery, you don't know in advance. My daughter married to a foreigner and she is ok. -She is ok, but are you ok? -This is life. Children go where is better. This year I might go as well there, to help her with the baby.
