You always imagined it happening to you. Some young student, always male, in your cramped basement office, twitching with anger, fear about not getting into med school, law school, or the like, about mountains of debt swallowing his stillborn future, and all because of you. Because you dared make him look outside himself, see past his narrow experience to the inherent difficulties that come with not being male, because, no, you wouldn't consider changing his grade, but most of all, because you dared challenge him. Entitlement mixes with adrenaline, with fear, with testosterone. You smell the incendiary cocktail wafting off him while his leg twitches wildly, until he lift the edge of his shirt. A simple, subtle gesture. Graceful, even. He flips up the bottom corner of his tasteful green button-down, and there is it, obediently waiting in its holster, eyeing you with its obsidian stare. You slowly raise your hands. Why? Instinct, probably? You've seen it 100 times in movies. This is the way you survive when someone pulls a gun, right? You slowly lift your empty arms. The international symbol of plaintive innocence. Never mind this young man isn't a cop, and, even if he were, raising your hands is far from a guarantee of survival. Still, your hands ascend, weightless, while words tumble out, heavy and insubstantial, at once. They're all that stand between you and this man, his gun, its obsidian stare. Maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to your point of view. Maybe we can take another look at your final grade -- That's when you feel it. Warmth. Takes a moment to register it's your own. That you're in shock. That you never heard the shot or saw the muzzle flash a few inches from your face. The warmth continues spreading down your face, trickles into your mouth, and when that first taste of iron hits your tongue -- pure rust invading your mouth -- all your sensation floods back. Burning, stabbing, throbbing as he blasts and blasts away as life slowly slips from your grasp... And then you wake up. The first time you have this dream is the time you ask a student -- a male student -- to kindly consider the premise that there just might be some small disadvantage to being a woman -- it's a women's studies course after all -- and to try to incorporate such a perspective into his paper revision. What you get back is no revision at all but the original paper covered in Post-it Notes full of borderline violent screeds about your "insidious propaganda," the college's "inhumane curriculum requirements," and your "appalling vendetta" -- three underlines -- against men. This is the first time you entertain the possibility that it might not be someone else on the news next time, that next time it just might be you. This is when you start locking your office door even during office hours --especially during office hours and post a cute hand-written sign urging students to "Please do knock!" You do it under the excuse of needing to concentrate on your research, but what distraction could there possibly be at the end of a lonely basement hall? And every time you open the door, you hope your students won't notice how you pause just a bit to see if you can catch a glimpse of anything through the cracked door, see anything shining before you open wide with a smile, invite them in, blame your slowness on your age and the heavy door. "Oh, this heavy door," you say with a chuckle. After a few semesters, the young man in question -- in your head you call him The Catalyst -- he graduates magna cum, of course, and your panic starts to subside, the dreams recur less frequently, but recur nonetheless. So you still -- you remain vigilant. Each new class, you identify a most likely candidate, just a minor mental checkmark, and maybe you start leaving your office door open again, but this time with a strategically placed mirror something tasteful with a funky frame, something you "thrifted!" you tell the students. You place it right at the spot where you can see anyone coming round the corner from your desk, and maybe you even move your desk... Give yourself just enough time to run to the door and slam it shut should you need to. At least this is what you tell your therapist one Wednesday afternoon when she remarks that you seem especially on edge. The Catalyst of your confession is not some student this time but the little stickers that have suddenly appeared in every window now that concealed carry is the law of the land. Thank you, Supreme Court! Little stickers with the silhouette of a menacing weapon -- a .9-mil, you will later learn -- with a bright red line through it. The stickers people are now legally required to put up if they don't want someone bringing a weapon into their establishment, as if that's something one should have to state aloud. "No, please don't bring that thing that's likely to get one of us killed into my otherwise peaceful place of work." It really should be the opposite, you'd think, an opt-in sort of thing where those who truly prefer weapons should be required to post "Weapons, please!" or something of the sort so you and everyone else who's sane can know exactly where to avoid. Because now each time you see that silhouette, it feels like an assault. You sweat, start to palpitate. But more than that, you wonder if some troubled young man who wouldn't otherwise will suddenly turn to violence precisely because he has that subtle reminder, that silhouette and all its potency -- power, sex -- knocking around somewhere in his subconscious. And, well, even though it makes sense that she of all people would need one in her window, the last place you expect to see one of these silhouettes staring at you is on your therapist's door. So she of course senses your anxiety, asks an incisive question and it all comes out -- about The Catalyst, the recurring dream, the mirror on your office wall, the many "minor" precautions you've taken. You pretend to laugh it off, try to make it seem like you have a sense of humor about the whole thing because this is the first time you've admitted any of this to anyone, and, naturally, you're worried what she'll think of you but when you've finished, you have to admit that you feel lighter. Unburdened. Closer to her. Until you hear the hint of skepticism in her voice. Though she does her best to conceal it, you still sense it in the up-glide at the end of each sentence in her false affirmation. You probe her to see if your intuition is correct, slip in a subtle "you know what I mean?" But when her response is vaguely noncommittal you remind yourself to never question your intuition again. This is the first time you feel judged by your therapist. As you drive away from her office full of shame, embarrassment at having shared those thoughts, but most of all at having thought those thoughts, you have this sudden streak of insight and laugh out loud because of course she'd judge you. Of course she wouldn't understand. The stakes aren't the same for her. If something happens to her, if some unstable patient walks in and decides to disregard the little sticker in her window, she has a successful husband, a large and loving family for her children to fall back on, but if the same thing happens to you there will be no one to take care of Michael. Yes. Michael... who can't wait to start second grade... who is the greatest choice you've ever made... the most challenging choice you've made. Even though, your whole life, you chose nothing but challenge, like how you chose to embrace your love of books, even though it meant never fitting in with all the "normal" girls where you grew up. Or how you chose to ignore your parents when they said not to get your hopes up for a scholarship, and that college might not be possible without one. Or how you chose grad school over a more tedious and sensible career path, but... All of that just felt like the bare minimum of what you had to do to survive. But, with Michael, you actually had a choice, and you still chose him. Even though it meant choosing challenge every step of the way. And not just because you had to pick the donor yourself, drive yourself to all the appointments. Not just because you had no relief on diaper duty. Those are the easy parts. To choose to have a child by yourself in the quiet bedroom community surrounding your college's campus, it means choosing the subtle scrutiny of everyone around you. Choosing to endure their silent belief that yours is a place of yearning, yours is a place of lack. At first, the lack of sleep makes you mistake their pity for approval -- support, even -- but when the offers of food and childcare turn to barbecues, dinner parties, playdates where some single man is always present, the smiles on the cherubic faces of your friends seem to have something else behind them some implicit question like... "Haven't you forgotten something, dear?" And when months of single men fail to yield any change in your life, women start appearing in their place -- these people aren't prejudiced, after all -- and though you find the women a...more alluring option, they are not the option, not your option, not right now. So you stop showing up to their dinner parties, cocktail hours, start saying you'll be out of town or "Michael's not feeling well." And when it turns out you were lying, when you get caught in line at the grocery store or taking Michael to the park, well, then their soft-eyed sympathy turns to resentment, brittleness of spirit. How could you be so ungrateful as to turn down their charity, after all? It's the worst thing you can do to a well-meaning white liberal, reward their good intentions with ingratitude. They'd sooner have a murderer in their midst. So you turn even further inwards, lose yourself in the oasis of his smile, in the eyes that seem wiser than they can even comprehend... He'll never know how grateful you are that he never asks why he doesn't need his babysitter anymore, why the other parents are never at his play dates anymore, that he never asks why he doesn't have a a mommy and a daddy, or a mommy and a mommy. He will never know how grateful you are that he just seems to know... This is how you come to be alone with Michael. This is how you come to be uniquely terrified of what might happen if a student rounds the corner weapon in hand and you're too buried in a book to see it in the mirror and get the jump on the door. Because then who'd take care of him? Your sister is 600 miles and a universe away and absent her unlikely return to reality -- someone who pities him, that's who. Someone who'll silently wonder whether he's better off, whether your demise was merely some small hurdle in his narrative of triumph. And pity is no recipe for excellence. Those are the first words out of your mouth when you hear there's a shooter. Even before your flash of relief at how circumstance has vindicated your paranoia, even before you wonder whether your therapist will be forced to apologize the next time you see her for doubting you, judging you, if you even live to see her! Before any of those thoughts can surface, you find yourself whispering the words as if in a trance. "Pity is no recipe for excellence." Then you find yourself bounding towards the door, eyes on your mirror the entire time, until you're just about to slam it shut when you catch your Department Chair, the one who came to tell you, looking at you quizzically. You always imagined it happening to you. So when you hear her say, "There's a shooter at the school," you think she must mean your school. Nottheschool. The elementary school. Next thing you know, you're standing at a police barrier in a line of other anxious parents waiting for some word. Absent any information, parents pull out phones, start streaming CNN, MSNBC to see what they can tell you. The absurdity of watching reporters on your phone who are standing mere feet from you, reporters who know nothing more than you do, is lost in the upside-down logic of this moment. Minutes pass, hours, or so it seems, without any updates from police. Data plans buckle, phones die. When you hear it. The sound is so much duller than in your imagination, yet it's unmistakable. So is its direction. As officers start to pour out of the building, you know it can only mean one thing -- the shooter has become his own victim. Answers are now inevitable. The sheriff separates parents by classroom and grade, and soon everyone is lined up like children anxiously waiting for their teachers on the first day of school. You watch the sheriff work his way from classroom to classroom, grade to grade, dispatching some grades wholesale to the safe-zone where their unblemished children wait. With others, he goes down the line name by name, some parents collapsing into others' arms. When it comes to your grade, your room, 2C... he stops short and lowers his gaze. Though he soon finds strength to speak. By that point, it is unnecessary. Still, he stumbles on, unleashes a stream of information -- How the teacher did her best to barricade the room... how the shooter forced his way in despite her efforts.. how the shooter took his own life in that very room -- all of which feels painfully irrelevant when stacked against the sheer magnitude of the fact that your son is no longer alive. You silently resent that the sheriff is still speaking, that he's dared to speak at all, resent every word that crosses his quivering lips so you tune him out only to notice birds still singing, squirrels preparing for the fast-approaching winter, leaves caressing each other in the cool autumn breeze, and you resent them, too, for their casual indifference. By the time the sheriff moves to the microphones, you resent the sun for giving light enough to see, the air for giving oxygen to breathe, anything and everything that allows you to go on living while your son is dead. Because there you are -- still alive -- still living, at least -- and incapable of doing anything to remedy that most unfortunate fact. You glance at your phone, out of habit or because the body seeks comfort in routine, when an alert on your screen warns you Michael is an hour late for soccer practice. You find your thumb sliding unlock on the screen, starting to dial your sister 600 miles and a universe away because "Sharing your joy multiplies it. Sharing your pain halves it." Or so you remember reading somewhere. And just as you're about to hit send on the call, you remember where it was -- on the wall of your dentist's office -- and wonder how something that seemed so inane in the midst of a root canal could possibly comfort in a moment like this before wondering how your mind can be so fucking feeble as to think about a root canal right now. Then you wonder if your sister, in her hazy ignorance, could possibly comprehend what you are about to tell her. And even if she could, would she care? You suddenly see the virtue in her philosophy of radical detachment. You consider not saying anything about what's happened but calling her anyway just to ask her advice on how she manages to float through life so unencumbered. Instead, you just stand there while slowly -- or quickly? You have no idea. A vigil materializes in front of you. Your body soon buzzes from the hymns all around -- hymns whose vibration almost swallows you whole along with candles, silk-screens, solemn prayers that all feel so poignant, so prescient in the moment... But when they yield to a steady stream of lunches, potlucks, support groups, suddenly you see the latent pathology in this endless cycle of nurturing, in meals so carefully prepared but perpetually uneaten, in comfort so aggressively given yet so rarely received... And all of it focused with particular intensity on you. Because you need the nurturing more than most because Michael was "all you had" and now that he's gone, well, what do you have to live for? And while you don't disagree, you still sense a haughty superiority in their gestures of support, a message beneath their Bundt cakes and floral arrangements -- "If you'd just listened to us, if you'd taken our advice when you had the chance, well, you wouldn't be alone right now, would you?" As if another body in your bed would blunt the pain. You consider asking them if their lumpy, inadequate partners actually bring them any solace. Instead, you let your thoughts drift to the shooter's parents, who you find yourself thinking about a lot more than the parents of the other victims. You imagine the singular depth of their loneliness and find it familiar. Or at least you imagine it to be. And maybe you even call a journalist who wrote about them, ask him how to reach the shooter's parents, and when he says they'd rather not be reached by you or anyone, maybe you offer him some cash to make it worth the effort. But when he still declines, emphasizes their overwhelming need for privacy, you press no further because you harbor no anger, no ill will toward them, even though their need seems somewhat ironic to you. Still, you respect it. Because you can't even begin to imagine. Not that. So you recede back into the sea of other mourning parents and tolerate their pity as far as Michael's closed-casket funeral -- "the only option," according to the funeral director. When the intensity of their grief feels especially false, you bear it nonetheless so as not to seem ungrateful. But when you've put the box that supposedly holds your son into the ground, you go home and vow never to talk to them again. You shut the door and wonder if it was all a dream. Sitting on the edge of his unmade bed, surrounded by the puzzles, other toys that captured his earnest attention for hours, surrounded by the sheets that still hold his smell, you can't help but wonder how it can be that a mother can drop her son off at school one unremarkable September day then never seen the oasis of his smile or any part of him again, as if he disappeared into thin air. Yet, when you find your body forgetting waking up at 6:00 AM to pack his lunch, making his morning oatmeal, washing his sheets. How can you forget for even a moment? You smack yourself so violently, your skin becomes a canvas of blue, purple, brown. How could you be so stupid, you think. Did Michael matter so little to you? In your darkest moments, you start to wonder whether your forgetfulness means the other parents were right... and the whole endeavor was ill-fated from the start. This vicious cycle -- amnesia, guilt, swift and brutal punishment -- continues until one day, just before sunrise, standing the kitchen washing dishes, you swear you see him out of the corner of your eye, catch yourself asking him what he wants for lunch, and start to pound your thigh over and over when it suddenly occurs to why you keep forgetting! It's that you have no way of knowing what happened in that classroom. No witness, no tangible thing to grab hold of. You suddenly regret speaking out against surveillance cameras in the elementary school, regret using the words "police state" in the PTA meeting. At least then, you'd have some access to his final moment, some contact. You find yourself devouring various news reports, series, speculations on what might have happened, what might have motivated the shooter, what path he might have taken through the school. You get DVR just so you can see all the competing specials, piece together a composite picture, and when none of it works, you go to the police department to request the relevant reports. When the young sergeant working the desk realizes who you are, he hesitates, understandably, but before he can open his mouth to say, "Um, are you sure?" or "Maybe this isn't the best idea," you remind him he works for you. And how could he stand between a mourning mother and what she says she needs? Before you know it, you're walking out of there with a bundle of paperwork tucked under your arm, paperwork you spread across your floor while pundits blather in the background. Maybe you even haul all the furniture out of the living room and tape out the position of each body on the floor, in some feeble attempt to retrace Michael's final moments. But even then, as you walk among the tiny taped out bodies, stand as they might have stood, crouch in imagined terror, trying to conjure the shooter before you, even as you do it all again with tape that glows and close the curtains to block out distraction, all your efforts seem so uncertain, so... speculative. You will never know what happened in that room. So your mind fixates on meaning, finding somewhere to assign blame, but all the usual suspects -- inadequate mental healthcare, the NRA -- seem so distant, nebulous, as far beyond your grasp as the circumstances surrounding Michael's death. The only tangible thing you can think of are the tiny stickers on every door, the tiny fucking stickers that don't do anything. You consider doing a ritual purge, carrying a razor blade, scraping them from every single door. But what good would that do? And then, in the midst of your despair, your salvation appears in the form of a news report on the store where the shooter purchased his weapon. legallypurchased his weapon. Before the story's even ended, you find yourself in your car, barreling off the highway onto a lonely state road that will lead you to where this man, this mercenary dispenses death. The entire drive over, you savor what you will tell this man, about he murdered Michael, how he profits, about the distinction between legality and morality. But, most of all, you savor the clarity of purpose for the first time since you lost your son. The give of the gravel beneath your feet propels you across the parking lot, through the door, to your task, when you see it. The same assault rifle the shooter used, looking down imperiously from its post high above the shop. You'd recognize that weapon, its silhouette, both jagged and supple, anywhere. You've Googled it so many times, stared at its image so long, you can see it on the inside of your eyes when you close them at night. And standing beneath that silhouette is a man who looks not at all like the merchant of death you imagined, but a placid grandpa, who looks at you with round, wet eyes that are almost swallowed by big walrus brows, and it takes you a second to even register he's talking to you, asking you, "Is there something I can help you with?" All you can manage is to raise your arm and point at the weapon on the wall. He asks if you'd like to hold it. You find yourself nodding. He asks whether you've ever fired a weapon. You shake your head. And just as you sense he'll suggest you start smaller, his doubt seems to strengthen your resolve. "I want to hold it!" you say, with enough force that the words send him up the ladder with knowing, probing steps, until he reaches the top, dutifully slings the thing over his shoulder, and descends, before gently dropping it into your arms like a small child. It's lighter than it looks. "Because the butt's made of plastic," he says. And then, ever the gentlemen, he asks permission to touch you so he can show you how to hold it, and you hesitate just a second before you nod, let him fold his large, leathery hands over your own to place you in the proper position. But, as he does, as he sets your arm and shoulder at the proper angle, you sense something off in his approach to this machine. Even then, in all your ignorance, you sense a lie in the taught muscular stance he tells you to take, the delusion that he or any man can actually control something so power. You take the opposite approach, surrender to its size, weight, as he steps back to give your stance a once-over and, impressed, asks if you'd like to give it a go. "We've got a shooting range out back." You follow him to the industrial-sized storage shed behind his shop, where he presents you with a pair of plastic goggles and earmuffs before warning you to "watch out for the kick." He says the same force that throws the bullet forward throws the weapon backwards, along with anything in its path. Most first-timers of a weapon this size underestimate the power, and the force of the shot sends their shoulder all herky-jerky, bullets flying every which way. So why don't we start with one bullet and work our way up from there, okay? You nod, slip on your goggles, while he preps the weapon, places it in your arms, and counsels you to start by breathing in and out, deeply, slowly. Then, when you're ready, slowly squeeze the trigger on the exhale. He slides the muffs over your ears. Suddenly, you're alone with your thoughts, peripheral vision sliced off by the edge of your goggles. Unable to see anything but the silhouette straight in front of you, unable to hear anything but your quickening pulse. You try to take the man's advice and inhale slowly, but the breath is shallow, sharp, and panic starts to set in. You shut your eyes, trying to nip it in the bud... when you see Michael... standing where the silhouette was. It's the clearest you've seen his face since before that day. And even though he sees the weapon you're pointing right at him, he's smiling... waving... unafraid. You blink your eyes to make sure what you're seeing is real. Open, close. Silhouette, son. Still there, still smiling. Your breath deepens, pulse slows. Open, close. Silhouette, son. Inhale, exhale. Open, close. Silhouette, son. Inhale, exhale. Open, close. Silhouette, son. Inhale, exhale. Squeeze. The kick bring such a familiar jolt. Just like the way Michael used to keep you up all night when he was still inside you. You squeeze the trigger hoping to feel the jolt again, but nothing, and, again, nothing. And you hardly feel the man slide the muff off your right ear and whisper, "Well done." You open your eyes. The silhouette wears a dime-sized hole smack in the center of its torso. The man asks if you'd like to give it another go. You said you'd like to buy it. When he warns you this particular model comes with a hefty price tag, you assure him you're prepared to pay whatever it's worth. This is how you go from never having held a gun to owning an assault rifle in a matter of minutes. The ease of the purchase, just a driver's license and 3-minute wait both terrifies and delights you. In theory, you know full well you can legally walk out of there with this weapon this very moment, but when it actually comes to doing it, you expect there to be some catch, some complication. So when there isn't, when you're able to get into your car, weapon in its pristine case, and just drive away, you are instantly consumed with laughter that carries you the whole way home. When you get there, you step into the living room, still empty except for the tape outlines on the floor. You draw the blinds, close the curtains again, but, this time, you stand in the spot where the shooter was, staring right at Michael's outline. Then you slip on goggles, ear muffs, flip open the case, grip the weapon in your hands, surrender to its weight, shut your eyes... but nothing. You try again, this time, breathing deep to slow your heart rate, but there's no tension, no danger. So you crack open the complimentary ammo the kind old man insisted you take, slide it in the clip, but you keep your finger clear of the trigger. Still nothing. You switch off the safety and let your trembling finger hover over the trigger. Nothing. Panic starts to set in that you have done this unconscionable thing, betrayed yourself by buying this weapon, and all in vain. The panic is compounded by guilt as your breath grows shallow, sharp, when suddenly, you feel the kick, hear the round ricochet off the far wall. You study your shaking arms, set the weapon down, run to inspect the splintered wall. and turn around to find Michael still smiling. You immediately look up the nearest shooting range. Five minutes from campus. Close enough to slip a session in between your Tuesday classes, where you can comfortably cordon it off from the rest of your life. You put it in your calendar and call it "Centering." The next week at work, your Department Chair is shocked to find you in your office. She tries to gently bring up the subject of extended leave, or maybe taking your sabbatical a semester early, but you assure her that's not necessary, so long as you continue to teach and teach well, which, you definitely do. The second your chair leaves your office, you feel no shame in continuing to surf the Internet for advice on how to handle your new companion, a topic on which you soon become an expert. It turns out, your initial instinct when holding the weapon in that store, your instinct -- that machine is powerful, machine has a mind of its own, and the only way for the two of you to coexist is to align yourself with its interests, it turns out, that instinct was dead-on. You read biographies of the world's best snipers, scour advice blogs of Olympic shooters, read how they wear lead vests that slow their heart rate to the point that they can shoot between each beat. Your stomach turns to think that the shooter might have done it with such complete calm and poise. He might have done it without feeling anything at all. Still, you read on, fight the mounting nausea, do what you must to be with Michael, to the hope of seeing him inside that silhouette. And when the pain is too great, the nausea too overwhelming, you remember when you were in labor with Michael, how alone you were. How you hypnotized yourself to diminish the pain. And suddenly you understand. To shoot a weapon well is to merge yourself completely with the needs of another being. To shoot a weapon well is to deny the most basic elements of the self. It is an act not unlike parenting. The only way you succeed is to surrender. So surrender you do. 7 days a week. Because you soon learn that, like a child, a weapon can't be cleanly cordoned off between your Tuesday classes. Like a child, a weapon won't be satisfied until it dominates your every thought. 7 days a week, at the range, you stare at the black hole of that silhouette, see Michael inside it, try to stretch time so you might live with him as long as possible in those moments between beats, in those few fleeting seconds before you squeeze off another round. The bruise that soon sprouts on your shoulder in gold and purple tones burns with satisfaction. each time the unforgiving butt of your gun assaults it. You believe this bruise is a sign that you're siphoning all of Michael's pain out of him... and into you. When you strip to shower at night, you place a hand on the bare skin, feel its throbbing warmth. But, soon, shoulder numbs to the pain, the blankness of that silhouette loses its life, and you find yourself collecting the many misshapen rounds you shot, running your hands over their smooth, rough surface, trying to comprehend the kind of power that could produce such a contradiction, and maybe you even... pound those rounds into your bare shoulder, make the bruise blossom anew. Until one night, when the sharp edge of one misshapen round tears into your skin, coats the cool lead with warmth that shocks your system. As you stand there, blood bubbling from your ruptured flesh, you suddenly see the absurdity of your ritual at the range, see its violence with frightening clarity. That night, you bury your companion in the backyard. Only to find yourself unable to leave it alone the next day. Unable to even set food outside your house. Unable to teach your class for the first time! So long as it remains behind. This is how you decide to join the group of parents testifying before the state legislature, parents whose many overtures you've ignored until now, parents testifying on behalf of a bill that would outlaw your lone companion, even as you can't help but let it lead you to the range every night, or precisely because you can't help but let it lead you to the range every night. You volunteer your car for the caravan to the capitol, "to pitch it," you say, but you really do it in case the chaos of the legislative chamber is too much to bear and you find yourself needing to escape for the simplicity and solitude of a firing range. You decide not judge yourself should you feel the need to do this because who could blame you for needing a release? You find the closest range to the statehouse and memorize the route. 6.2 miles, a 13-minute drive. On the drive to the statehouse, you wonder if any of the other parents have the faintest clue they're in a car that's carrying one of the very weapons they're coming to decry. You make it through the interminable drive by imagining the look of shock on each of their earnest faces if one of them were to discover it while popping your trunk during a pit stop to fish out cholesterol meds or Junior Mints. The expressions you imagine are so absurd, you find yourself smiling in the midst of the solemn ride. When all the parents arrive, you're gathered together in an antechamber and reminded of the rules -- two minutes each, no more. Do keep track of your own time so as not to make committee members look bad by cutting you off. Do address the committee properly and respectfully. Then the page asks everyone to wave their phones in the air to prove they are in fact switched off. You eye your carefully scripted statement, double-spaced, as you're escorted onto the floor. The pregnant silence that fills the chamber as you take your seat soon yields to a monotonous rhythm of two minutes, two minutes, two minutes, two minutes, two minutes, two minutes, two minutes -- a rhythm that could blunt even the most blistering testimony. A rhythm you think is almost intended to undermine you. Parent seem more preoccupied by the ticking clock, the onerous and arbitrary rules then the words coming out of their mouths. Not that you blame them! You soon find your own attention strained from the stilted statements to the committee members who struggle to perform their earnest engagement. Their effort is palpable. Except for a young senator whose rounded, boyish features are emphasized by how he expelling air out of the side of his mouth. As parent after parent testifies, you watch the senator's gaze drag back and forth between his watch and legal pad where his pen meanders about the page. You'd pay a fortune to glimpse the childish doodles you're sure you caught him drawing and eagerly wait the moment he has to flip the page so you can confirm your suspicions. But, before he does, it's your turn. And as the committee members commence the perfunctory shuffling of their papers, crane their necks when you quietly clear your throat, you toy with telling them the truth. Telling him the truth. How you've experienced firsthand the raw power of the weapons in question, how you can't imagine what task would demand such force, how you still find that force electric. You feel the need to bear it all, to show him the bruise on your shoulder as proof to say you're the prime example of how a citizen can't be trusted to control herself around machines of such seductive power. You feel yourself starting to say all this, starting to reach for your shoulder, when you see the pale glow of a screen in the senator's lap. He's started texting from his seat You're so shocked by what you see that several gaping seconds pass before a sound emits from your throat. Gaping seconds gone forever from your two-minute time limit. It's too late to go off-script, too late to do anything other than read the words in front of you with such ferocity you might win his undivided attention, or even just a glance away from that screen, but neither comes before someone is tapping your shoulder to tell you your time is up. On the drive to the firing range, you spend every second at red lights -- and maybe some seconds not at red lights -- scouring your phone for information about this man. You visit the legislative web page to pair a name with a face, and what you find waiting for you, the well-coifed hair and easy grin can't help but make you laugh. The other parents from your carpool keep calling and calling. You send them straight to voicemail. They'll squeeze into the cars, you think, as you continue wringing the Internet dry of whatever it will yield about this senator. His personal life -- single, from everything you see. His voting record -- aggressively pro-gun. Awkward photo ops. A radio interview where he's skeptical about the number of children killed by guns, where he calls those statistics the... "exaggeration of hysterical liberals." You resolve to find some way to see the senator alone. So you check into a hotel for the night. sit there waiting for the sun to rise, and, first thing in the morning, check your trunk, see your companion still inside it, and head straight to the statehouse, the senator's office, where you say you're a lobbyist. But the staffer at the front desk seems skeptical. Any lobbyist would know her boss doesn't do morning meetings. She starts listing dates and times you might be able to meet him, so you say, "You don't need much time, just a few brief moments," and you're happy to hang out here and wait until he's free, at which points, she covers by saying, "There's really nowhere to wait. He has one of the smallest offices..." Seniority, or something. And as you open your mouth to protest, you clock the slightest hint of fear in her eyes. The same fear you had when that first student who covered his paper in Post-Its came to see you in your office. So you stand down, for her sake and yours. On your way out of the statehouse, you pass a handful of reporters. One of them recognizes you from your testimony the day before and asks who you're here to see. When you say the senator's name, she can barely keep from rolling her eyes before scribbling the name of a bar on a scrap of paper and telling you he conducts his business there, starting at 8:00. You drive by the bar on the way to a mall, where you spend hours searching for the dress you're sure will catch his eye. Then you call your department chair and leave a message saying, yes, you are going to need that extended leave after all. And thank you for being so understanding. Back at the hotel, you hang your dress out to steam while you shower, in preparation, before you arrive a half-hour early and perch conspicuously at the end of the bar with a glass of wine. He arrives 20 minutes late to his own self-appointed hour, taking suitor after suitor while you hang back, nurse your wine, contemplate your next move. But something unexpected surfaces when you're watching him from across that bar, watching the compulsive drumming of his fingers on the tabletop, the slow sweep of his palms down his pant legs. And soon you start wonder whether that behavior is a sign of energy or restlessness, whether that's enthusiasm or desperation beneath his too-eager smile. Whether he's buoyed by a sense of purpose or leading a life that's devoid of joy, when, suddenly, he makes eye contact. You have a hard time telling whether he recognizes you or not, whether he's terrified you followed him here, or excited at the chance to meet a lovely stranger. But when your eyes meet again, he suddenly raises his brows, as if to say, "Yes, I see you, and, don't worry, I'll definitely be with you just as soon as all this nonsense is over." Suddenly, you're no longer content to be the next thing on his agenda. You drape your purse over your shoulder, walk out of the bar, and leave what happens next to chance. You're almost at your car when you feel his hand on your arm. Before you can even feign contrition, having interrupted his meeting, he apologizes for making you wait and wonders aloud if he can't talk you back into the bar for another drink. You're now certain he has no idea who you are, so you suggest heading somewhere else. And before you can even wonder whether you're coming on too strong, he offers to take you in his car. You say you'd feel more comfortable following in your own. As you crawl behind him down suburban streets, you clock his eyes in his rearview mirror, studying you every step of the way, filling you with the incendiary mix of giddiness and disgust. And when he signals to turn into a driveway, you pull over a little up the block, put your car in park, and find yourself walking around to the back of it where you pop the trunk and let your hands hover over the spare compartment where it lies in wait. You watch your hands hover, see how long you can hold them there before they tremble and retreat or act for themselves. When you hear his voice call out, "You coming?" and see him look at you with his bemused sort of half-smile, at which point, you were just making sure you hadn't forgotten something. Then ease the trunk shut, listen to the latch click. The only touch of personality in his too-tasteful apartment are the crude crayon drawings that line the entrance hall, drawings you barely have time to take in before he calls you into the living room, where he's waiting with a glass of wine. A quick scan of your surroundings reveals no photos of him hunting, no trophies on the walls. None of the signs you'd expect from someone who boasts his particular brand of zealotry. Just a clear glass coffee table and two black leather sofas. As you settle on the sofa next to him, ease into the soft leather, steal your first sip of wine, something about the impish smile that crawls onto your face makes him ask if you know who he is, and if you knew he'd be in that bar tonight. When your initial laugh doesn't seem to satisfy him, you say, "Yes, and no." Of course you know who he is, but seeing him in that bar, that was just a... happy accident. "How happy?" he asks, half-joking. And you start in, dead serious, or so he thinks, about how deeply you appreciate his tireless fight for your rights. How hard it must be to hold fast his principles when everyone around him is so compromised, how long you've admired him from afar. You're not sure what you expect when you start in like this. Maybe you're hoping to expose his hubris, let his naked ego soak your righteous rage, but the longer you go on, the more you sense his obvious discomfort, which strikes you as strange since you've seen plenty of his kind before, and they've never been the type to shy away from praise. Still, you take a perverse sort of pleasure in watching him squirm while you shower him with adulation. Until his discomfort is so overwhelming, you begin to feel guilty, and you slowly start to realize that this man doesn't believe the things you're saying any more than you do, that this man is no zealot at all, but a too afraid to live the consequences of his convictions, that his cowardice is so monumental... he doesn't deserve to exist. But before your rage can amount to anything, he grabs you lightly by the wrist and kisses you. You let the kiss run its course, then flash a giddy smile until confident he's set the encounter back on track. He excuses himself to go to the bathroom. You say you'll try not to miss him too much. But soon after he shuts the door, you're pretty sure you hear him turn on the shower. You do...hear him turn on the shower. And find yourself seizing the unlikely opportunity to move to your car, pop the trunk, remove the weapon from its compartment, slip a single round into the chamber, and step back inside where you pause momentarily on the crayon drawings by the door before returning the living room, facing the bathroom, assuming your stance. Amidst the sound of cascading water, you focus on your breath, try to steady your stubborn heart, which seems like a losing proposition, so you shut your eyes and find Michael, waiting for you. Only, this time, he's not smiling. He seems... disappointed that you would take this sacred thing, this intimate act between the two of you and waste it on someone so unworthy. That you would let this stranger, this coward... diminish it. It's the first moment since he was taken from you, since you first held him in your arms in the hospital that you wish you couldn't see your son. Wish he'd just let you have this, this one thing! But even when you open your eyes, he's still -- He's standing right there. Staring at you. You...set the weapon down, tear your fingers from the cold comfort of the metal grip, leave that part of you lying on the clear glass coffee table, one bullet still in the chamber, then you turn and run down the hall, where you find yourself frozen on the drawings by the door. Whose drawings they are, you'll never know, but you're stuck there, staring at them, when you hear the shower stop, grab the closest one off the wall, tuck the frame under your arm, keep running to the car, start the engine, and drive... ...and drive... ...and drive. How far, who knows? You think of the senator stepping out of the shower, your offering on his table, one round in the chamber, having to live with that terror -- I mean, to know how close he came... until there's nothing in the rearview, just darkness -- the same in front -- until the black smothers you so fully, you can't tell how fast you're going, or even if you're going at all. So you lift your foot from the gas, let the car roll to a stop, look down to focus on your breath, see the drawing still in your lap. Its messy lines running off the page. Remember how Michael's eager marker always skipped off his paper, got on the carpet. You should go home, you think, tear up the tape outlines, see if the marker stains are still there, run your fingers over them before they fade. You catch movement in the rearview, see Michael in the seat behind you. No longer disappointed, but... You turn around to smile at your son... ...but he's gone. Thank you.
