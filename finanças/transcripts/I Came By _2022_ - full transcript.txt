Yo, Tobes. When it's time to dip, it's time to dip. - Can't be movin' mad. - Chill, man. Begging is not permitted at this station. Customers are requested not to encourage this behavior. Excuse me. Is this yours? Yes. Thank you. Lifesaver. Oh. Sorry. Thank you. The train now approaching is the Thameslink service to Clapham Junction. Stand back from the platform edge. Mmm. - Angus. - Stop talking. Angus! What the fuck? Watch it! Are we done yet, boss? I'm parched. Yeah. Almost. Hey, listen. Mind the tools. I'm gonna go take a leak. Aye. You're listening to Tears for Fears on this sunny London afternoon... Hello? There you are. - Can I help you? - Oh. Sorry. I was just, um... looking for the bathroom. In the living room? It's just along here to the left. Is that your old man? Yes. - I can see the resemblance. - Hm. Hey! - Mmm. Smells good in here. - You're a bit late. I had a doctor's appointment. Everything okay? Yeah. Just a checkup. How was your day? Yeah, it was fine. Hey, look at this. - I was at a judge's house today. Look. - Hmm. That gonna be us one day? In London? Not on a judge's salary, babe. Probably a wealthy family. What's the name? Hector Blake. Oh! Philip, my tutor, went to school with him. - They call him Saint Blake. - Oh yeah? Back when he was a QC, he'd take on inquests on behalf of refugees. And he'd do it for free. Maybe you could ask him to take a look at my dissertation proposal? Maybe you can ask Philip to do it. - Dickhead! - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. - That's abusive language. - Abusive? - Why are you being abusive? - I don't think it is. - No? - No, no... Well, it's too bad. 'Cause you can't get rid of me now. And why's that? I've got news for you. Aah! - You got me. - Yes. Yes, brother. Ah! - All right? - All right. I really need to eat. Wow, bro, this place is a rip-off! Don't worry. I got you. Tuna melt? - Aw, thanks, love. - You're welcome, darling. How many people? You know what I was reading about that judge? His family, they're all staunch colonialists. His father was a factory owner, critical of decolonization... - The sh... - Yeah, but people call him a saint. It's a publicity stunt. You know why? Hector later gets appointed as a High Court judge, but quits after a year, saying the bench... ...is "too white and elitist," pissing off the Lord Chancellor, Lord this and that, then bam, he's back in the news. But maybe he's just trying to right the wrongs of his family. Or to avert attention. Look. That's ivory. I mean, he's going mad for this imperialist shit. This is illegal now. It's just a fuckin' piece of antique, man. Whose side are you on, man? Hey, look, um... I can't do this no more. Naz is pregnant. - Well, fuck. - Yeah! - I know. - She's not gonna keep it, is she? Of course she's gonna fucking keep it. I mean, we're both excited. Look, I know. I know it's a bit unexpected. - But... - Unexpected? - Who the fuck wants a kid at 23? - Um... Your mum? She doesn't count. Yo, listen. This changes shit. Look, I... I can't do no more missions. Yeah? You know the feds have me on their radar, and I can't risk going back in pen. No one is going back in the pen. You and me run this thing like clockwork. You know I can't do this on my own. I know, but maybe we need to call it a day. Writing was your thing, Jameel. Fight the system, remember? We just give up the fight 'cause you're havin' a kid? But what difference have we really made? - We've shown we can get to them. - Don't. We can get right inside their homes any time we want. Yes, and we've made our point, so let's just move on. Aah! You don't even want this kid. You're just doin' this for her. Fuck you for that, Toby. Jay, you can't wimp out on me. - I need you, bro! - Nah, bro. My child needs me. Yeah? Look, I ain't havin' him grow up the same way that we did. Listen, if you wanna keep writin', yeah, you do that. But you keep me out of it. Cheers. Thank you. Excuse me, can I get a takeaway box for this as well? And what do you want? Doesn't matter what I want. Faisal, medical education's giving you severe anxiety. You can't even look at blood without passing out. So I should man up then, yeah? I'm here to live their dream. That's what a good son does. He completes his parents' vision of the future. And what about your vision of the future? What would that look like? Computers. I love computers. But my parents want their only son to be a doctor. So it wouldn't work. I translate that as your parents don't share your vision, not that it wouldn't work. My mum's worked every hour God sends since she came to this country to give me and my sisters a better life. That's what parents do. It's sort of what we sign up for. The payoff is seeing your children happy. They'd be so disappointed if I drop out. My mum wouldn't ever get over it. And you don't want to hurt your mum. No. So, you'd rather hurt yourself instead? Morality is dead. Nobody does anything for a real or meaningful reason anymore. Everyone is just keepin' face, makin' sure they're part of the latest woke movement, but it's all disingenuous. So maybe it's time we took a good look at ourselves as individuals, and maybe took a little bit of responsibility, because real change must come from the ground up. Now, talking of meaningful versus meaningless acts, let's discuss the elusive "I Came By" taggers. After months of absence, it feels like they're back to haunt the city's rich. Two affluent homes were hit in the last three months, but what brought them out of their slumber, and is it even them? Before we get into it, hit that subscribe button down below. Hello? Toby, I'm home! So, Rave, you're a graffiti artist. Writer. Graffiti writer. There's a difference. - What do you make of "I Came By"? - Whoever done it is a fucking toy. I heard it's not the same crew anymore. Might be another dickhead with a tin of paint, playin' the hero. But graffiti belongs to the streets. Public places. You know what I mean? You don't break into people's homes, no matter who they are. That's a no-go. That's an interesting point, because the type of people these guys are targetin', isn't that a "fuck you" to the establishment? If so, isn't that the point of the graffiti movement? No, man. I mean, who are they even targetin'? Last month was a banker. How fuckin' original. Who's it gonna be next? Fuckin' Tony Blair? Oh, you've got to be kiddin' me. Toby? Toby? Toby! Have you seen the remote? I left it in a visible, normal place. This can't be the third one we've lost. I don't get it. Hello to you too, Mother. I did say hello. You didn't hear me. Can you help me look? Maybe it's the universe telling you to stop watchin' fame-hungry wannabe celebrities selling their souls. I am so sorry, Mr. Highbrow. So, what have you learned on YouTube today? Solved the world's problems, have we? Cool. Okay. I gotta go now. Wait. Where? Out. Well, can you tidy the kitchen before you go? It's a disaster in there. - I'll clean it when I get back. - Don't get too wasted! You old muppet. Fuckin' sausage. Call yourself a policeman? I thought you guys were meant to be fit. I barely leave my desk these days. I don't need to be fit. - Do you want a breather? - Yes, please. - All right, all right. - Aah. Aah. My teenage daughter's less glued to her phone than you are. I've gotta go. - What happened? - It's an alarm. Want me to send officers round to check? No, no, no. It's just a fire alarm at home. So, uh... I better go and see to it. I'll make it up to you. Okay. Keep me posted. Jesus! Hi, William. Thanks for calling. No, no, it's fine. No, it was just a false alarm. You know, just some sort of gremlin in the works, and... Yeah, technology's too clever by half. Hold on. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hector? You okay? No, it's all good. Yeah. Look, I'm sorry again about tonight, but, um... same time next week? - Why have you come? - Shh! - Please leave. - Let's sit and talk. Talk? I give you an education, and this is how... - We're a family. - Never come again. - I'm not going. - Just go. - No, I don't want to go. - You broke our family! - Get out. - Mum, what is this? Take your stuff. - You have to go. Get out of my sight! - Hey! - Please! - Take your stuff. Go. - Shame on you! - Come on, she's pregnant! And you! You've ruined her life. Take her! Let's go. Just calm down... - My daughter... - Please... Don't worry. Don't worry. - I don't want... - Please! Come on. Come on. Jesus. Toby? I need to talk to you. Babes, um... why don't you go inside and I'll be there in a sec? Yeah. Mate, now is not a good time. - Naz told her parents about the pregnancy... - Please, Jay. Something bad has happened and I don't know what to do, man. I broke into that judge's house. The guy you flagged months ago. - Nah, nah, nah. I don't want... - And when I got in there, I saw... - I don't want... - I don't know what I saw. - Will you just listen to me? - No. No, you listen to me. I don't wanna hear this. No need to go mental. We said if I wanted to keep writin', I could. Yes! Yes. And I told you to keep me out of it. Look, whatever mess you got yourself in, yeah, it's not my problem. You're on your own. Jay. Oh... What did he want? Standard Toby dramas. Emergency. - Which service do you require? - Police. Oh jeez. Hey, what's goin' on, fellas? Oh jeez, man. Nothin', man. We're just hangin' out and stuff. I hear that. Oh jeez. I'm supposed to be figurin' out who robbed the store across the street. But, oh jeez, I don't know. Oh jeez, man, that sucks that your Rick's makin' you do that. He's not my Rick. He's my partner. Oh jeez. Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick. Call me a sidekick one more time! Call me a sidekick! - Come on! Oh jeez. - Do you wanna see how I paint a wall? It was the Mortytown Locos, man. The Mortytown Locos. Oh! Know how many codes you violated? Oh jeez, Rick, what do I know about knowin' stuff? Get in the fuckin' car. More... Officers, what can I do for you? - Sir Hector Blake? - Yes. Mind if we come in? That's how you run a Citadel. If you wouldn't mind taking your shoes off. ...soaring, while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting The divide between the two groups has never been wider. Solve that one real quick. Oh, please. That's patently absurd. Surely it's a bored teenager playing a sick joke. Too much time on their hands. Might anyone have cause to target you with an accusation like this? I was a judge, so, yes, one or two people! Can I get you a coffee, officers? - Uh, no, thank you. - Yeah. - Mmm! - Thank you. - How do you take it? - White, please. Is there anyone else living here, sir? No, only me. Please do look around. I'm Rick D. Sanchez III, owner of this here wafer establishment, and I say that the Rick in there is right! He's more Rick than any of you. Is there a basement in this property? - Yes. - Do you mind if we have a look? I must tell William, William Roy, how diligent his officers are in responding to crank calls. I'm sure he wouldn't think it was a waste of police time. He's your superintendent, isn't he? Good squash player. Keeps me on my toes, anyway. ...with walking the fuck out of here. Yo, J-22! Give 'em hell! I completely understand, officers. You're just doing your job. Appreciate it. Thank you, sir. No, no, no, don't go! You spineless fuckin' pigs! Toby! Toby, open this door! What? The mess in the kitchen. Why is it still there? - Mum, honestly, I had such a shit day. - Oh, really? Doing what exactly? Fuck off. Excuse me? - Where do you think you're going? - Anywhere but here. Because I can't listen to this shit right now. No. No, right now, you get in there and you clean that kitchen. You know, it didn't just miraculously tidy itself yesterday, or the day before, or the day before that! Thank you, Mother, for tidying up after me. I appreciate what you do. Do you know what? Give me those keys. What? What are you doin'? How am I supposed to get back in? You can come back when you show me some respect and stop using my front door like a cat flap. Your front door? Dad was the one who bought this place. I don't recall you doing anything to earn it. Toby... I didn't... Why don't you give me the money he left for me, and I'll duck out of here happily? It's my money, Mum! I've told you. You're not ready to handle that kind of cash. I'm twenty-fucking-three! You need to let me get on with my life! Precisely. You're 23, and what have you achieved? You've given up on everything you've ever started. Music, art college, uni. You can't hold down a job for longer than a week. I work with kids every day that are so much worse off than you are, but they're all desperately fighting for something. And you, you... You've got no idea what I'm fightin' for. Don't wait for me to come back. Stupid bitch... Fuck you! Hey. Don't worry. I'm here to help you. But we don't have much time. Okay. Stay here, but be quiet. No... He... Please. Look at me. - Aah... - I'm gettin' you out of here, okay? Oh, for heaven's sake. You've wet yourself, have you? Oh, dear, dear, dear. This keeps on happening, doesn't it? Hmm? Well, I'm not going to clear it up. You're going to clear it up. Hm? The things you do. God, I'm getting emotional. I'm so bloody proud of you. This is, uh... my celebration of being different. I mean, that is just amazing. And the rice paper offshoots are just so beautifully done. Look at the tiny little letters and numbers. I love it. It reminds me of something from, um, the cartoon Yellow Submarine. I've never seen a cake anything like it. I don't think any of us have ever seen a cake like that. I'd have that on my 40th any day. When it eventually comes round. Yeah, I've been calling him. His phone's dead. Can you just let me know if he gets in touch, please? Yeah... Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry. - It's okay. I've been calling round all his friends to see if anyone's heard from him. Oh, yeah? Didn't know he had any. Sorry. Uh... This is, um... - I'm so sorry. - Detective Sergeant Ella Lloyd. Jameel Agassi. Jay. I'm one of Toby's mates. As it's been over 72 hours since anyone last saw or heard from Toby, we will treat this as a missing persons case. Now, do you have any reason to believe Toby could be in any danger? No. He's a good kid. I mean, I... I think he's just trying to punish me. Like I said, we argued before he stormed out. You didn't say what you argued about. What we always argue about. Money, his dad. - And where's his father? - Dead. I mean, he was old. He was never really around, anyway. Toby barely knew him. When was the last time you saw him? I don't know. Months ago, maybe. Ms. Nealey says you two are best mates. Almost like brothers. Yeah. We are. Not seeing your best mate for months doesn't sound too friendly to me. Yeah. I've got a baby on the way, so I've just been a bit, um... distracted. Right. Well, we have a recent photo of Toby, and you have my details. I'll be your point of contact, so if you think of anything else, notify me. - Thank you. - I'll see myself out. You know something, don't you? No. No. Hello? - Yo, Tobes... - Got ya! Leave a message! I can't promise I'll get back to you. Yo, Tobes. The fuck are you doin', man? Ju... Ring me. Don't take the piss. Oh, fuck. Open up. Oh, come on, man. What is this? I told you, I've been driving round all night. I'm just trying to get some rest. Guess you lot ain't used to seeing Black fellas round these ends. Don't try that shit with me. Do you wanna explain this? Jameel Benjamin Agassi. - July 2018, vandalism. - It was an empty building. It was private property. June 2020. Arrested at a protest at Westminster for not complying with the Public Order Act. You served six weeks in prison. And now you're in possession of an illegal substance. Come on, man. It was a butt end of a spliff. Which is a serious offense. Especially for someone with priors. Okay. I'm sorry. It's just my missus, she's seven months pregnant, and... I'm working 14-hour days, and... I ain't slept properly in months. I had a little smoke. So I was just trying to get my head down. I'm sure you know how that is. Toby? Jesus, Jay. What the hell? I'm sorry, Liz. I... I did knock, but you didn't hear, so I just used my key. I thought he'd come home. Shit. Sorry, Liz, I should've thought. I keep waiting for him to walk through the door, but he's not coming back, is he? I don't wanna hear that. This is classic Toby. Sorry. I took some Diazepam and it's making me a bit fuzzy. How are you doing? How's Naz? Yeah, good. She's gettin' big. Is she? Wow. Can't believe that I'm gonna be a dad. I'm shitting it, if I'm honest. You're gonna be an amazing father. God. Looks like a bomb's gone off in this place. Oh, to be fair, some of it was me. I've turned the place upside down. I don't even know what I'm looking for. Have you looked in his secret stash? His what? I was just about to look in it, just in case there was any clues. By the way, I didn't wanna mention this to DS Lloyd, because, well... I didn't know what she'd find. Sir Hector Blake? "In support of the environment, our alumni newsletter will go digital next month." - What is this? Why has he got this? - I dunno. Why would he have a letter addressed to some old Birlstonian hidden in his room? I've looked him up, this Hector Blake. He's an ex-judge. I can't imagine Toby ever met him in his life. What? What are you looking for? Jesus, can you just say something? I'm losing my mind here. Sorry. I'm glad you brought this to my attention. I'll be following it up. Well, what does that mean? Who is this man? Miss. Nealey, I suggest you go home, and wait for my call. That live trace we've got on Toby Nealey's phone. What was the last known location? Uh... Pitt Road. Why? The mother found this in Toby's bedroom, addressed to Sir Hector Blake, who lives on the same road. We got a call in last week from a young man reporting that someone was being held captive in the basement of the same address. You think that was Toby Nealey. That's what we're gonna find out. Sir Hector Blake? I'm DS Ella Lloyd. Can we step inside, please, for a chat? What's this about? I was on my way out. Sir, I have grounds to believe the life of a person on these premises is in danger. Not that again. Under Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, we need to come inside and search your property. I'm sure I don't need to explain Section 17 to someone of your stature. Please take off your shoes. Are you really looking for an endangered person in there? - I'd like to have a look at your basement. - This way, Sarge. ...division. Is any officer able to go to... This is my workshop. Workshop for what? My wife used to be a ceramicist. I took up pottery to help me feel closer to her. Where's your wife? Chesham House. - The psychiatric hospital? - Yes. Yes. I didn't say I made all of them. All right, all right. You got me, officer. Am I under arrest? Is there a door behind this shelving unit? Open it, please. It's my panic room. Hmm. This peephole's on the outside of the door, looking in. Must be a builder's mistake. Ah, I'd never noticed that before. Is that all you got? You looked like one of the smart ones. - What did you say? - Hm? Hector Blake, I'm arresting you for obstructing an officer... Oh, come on. ...in the execution of her duty. - What? - You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defense if you do not... Cuffs to the front. Thank you very much. - Don't worry. - It's all a misunderstanding. No, it's fine. I know she's doing her job. - She's very keen. - I'm sure. - I'll sort it out. - Of course. - We're gonna play... - Next week, Wednesday. Usual. - Wednesday. Okay. Yeah. - Okay. Yeah. Yes? So, that's it? You're done? Aren't you gonna ask how I did it? How did you do it? I mixed a bunch of sleeping pills and downed them with vodka. And then I woke up in a hospital. Apparently, I didn't get the dosage right. You're studying medicine. Shouldn't you know how many pills it takes to kill yourself? Faisal... Look. Maybe you didn't really want to die. Maybe your suicide attempt was a declaration of how much you actually want to live. Your way of telling your parents what you can't seem to say in words. No. I wanted to die. I wanted my parents to understand that they'd failed me. Are you okay? Have you heard from your family at all? I spoke with my sister a few days ago, but nothing from my parents. Where are they again? Tehran? No, Gorgan. It's, like, a small town, north of Iran. Oh. And my sister, she is in Tehran, and she tells me how they are. You don't speak with your parents? They've disowned me. Really? Why? Because of who I am, I guess. Oh God. I'm sorry. As if living in exile wasn't hard enough. I'm just happy to be alive, you know? Hmm. So, how come you're able to work? I'm not doing anything illegal. No, no, no. I wasn't suggesting for a second that you were. They rejected my application first time round. I mean, look, I'm not sure what more evidence they need. Me kissing a guy in front of them? So I appealed, and now I don't know what's happened to my case. It's been such a long wait that I'm eligible to work. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. - I need to survive. - Sure. It's nice getting to know you a little bit better. Maybe I could help you, if you'd like to discuss it further? What time do you finish? Thank you so much. You found me. - Come in. - I like your gate. - Very nice. - Yeah, it is, yeah. - Come in. - Yes. - Let me hang up your coat. - Thank you. If you wouldn't mind taking off your shoes. Mm-hm. - Can I get you a drink? - Sure, if you're having one. Uh, please don't say beer. I don't have beer. Whatever you want. - Then you'll join me in a gin and tonic. - Sure. You know best. I tell you what, why don't you put on a record? My vinyl's in that, uh, cupboard over there. It's so old it's back in fashion. You enjoy classical music. Uh, no. This one has a cool cover, like a Disney film. Sweet! Here. Shall I play you my favorite piece from this record? It's my father. You must love him so much to put his picture up like that. Well, I'm not sure about love. It's more complex than that. But, like it or not, he made me the man I am today. I'm sure he's proud. Oh, I doubt it. I'm sure he's very disappointed that I resigned. Well, why did you do that? Didn't want to live according to his plans anymore, and I was bored. But I feel he can still see me through that picture, even though he's long gone. So you keep that painting up to show him your middle finger every day? Pretty much. He thought I was going to be prime minister. I didn't even want to read law. No, he didn't care much for me or my mother. Oh. I'm sorry. We had a young Parsi helper. Oh. Persian, like me. Indian Persian. His name was Ravi. Quite a handsome young man. He'd moved over here to make money to provide for his family back in India. My father came across him working in his factory, and decided to take him under his wing. Very kind. Very charitable. And then he invited him to live in our house, like a member of the family. And eventually, he invited him into his bed. My poor mother was banished to the guest room. And not long after, she took her own life. And I was the little boy who found her with her wrists sliced open. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Well, there... there wasn't much consolation from my father. In fact, he sent me away to boarding school. I didn't care. I was quite happy there. In fact, it was better to be away from him and that boy. I hated that boy so much. To think that he replaced my mother and me. Living in our house, eating our food, breathing our air. That... peasant. Okay, that sounds kind of racist. No. No, not at all, no. If you knew anything about my career, you'd know I'm anything but racist. I really tried to be kind to him. I really tried. But I had this rage inside of me that was very hard to suppress. Well, maybe he was just a victim. Maybe he was forced to be in that situation by your dad. Everyone has a choice. Not when you're poor with nowhere to go. Anyway, that's all in the past. I only share this story with very special people like you. Do you want to know what happened to Ravi? Sorry. Can I use the bathroom first? Sure. - What's the matter? - Where are my shoes? Oh, you don't look so good. - No... - Come and sit down. No. No, no, no. I think I really should go. It's okay. Just take a moment and you can go. Maybe you drank that too quickly. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Can I have some water, please? Sure. So, what... What happened to Ravi? I thought I'd killed him. One summer when I came back from school, I pounced on him like a savage beast. Nearly destroyed his face. It was so liberating, so empowering. Hmm. Almost transcendental. Hey! Race, religion, sexual orientation, and transgender identity. Now, currently, there is a widely held view among many in the legal profession, myself included, that these sections of society are not protected by the criminal justice system equally... Sorry, sorry, sorry! Bloody hell, Jay! Stop doing that or I'm gonna have to take those keys back. Sorry! I knocked and knocked, but... I guess you couldn't hear me. Are those Toby's? Yeah. Where have you been? You don't answer my calls. I even called your work, and they said that you're takin' time off. Cup of tea? So, tell me, how are you? Officially a dad now. Really? When? A few weeks ago. - I'm so sorry. I should've got... - Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. He came out early. I guess my little man couldn't wait to come out. Well, that's amazing. Congratulations. - What's his name? - Who? - Your baby. - Oh. Aydan. Aydan. Yeah. Well, I'll have to come over and say hello to baby Aydan, introduce myself. Yeah, we'd love that. I mean, you're probably the closest thing to a gran he's ever gonna have. Liz? What's that? That's Hector Blake. He used to be part of the Law Commission, championing equality within the justice system. Which is a joke. But why are you watching it? I'm studying him, I suppose. Saint Blake is the devil and nobody sees it. I'm sure if that's true, then the police will find out. The police have already given up. Maybe because he's clean. Maybe because he's connected. But obsessing over him online ain't gonna get you anywhere. I know. I've been watching him in the real world too. Not just online. You're following him? - Oh, Liz... - I know. This is serious. Last night, I watched a young man hurl himself from Hector's window. You should've seen the state of him. He was completely incoherent at first. He says that Hector invited him back and spiked his drink. He jumped out of a window to get away from him. Thank God I was there. Did you go to the police? He didn't want to. He's an asylum seeker. He's afraid it will affect his case. No, but he has to. I know, but I can't push him. I'm trying to persuade him, but he's scared. I think he's right to be scared. - What the fuck do you want? - I brought your clothes back. - I don't want them. - Can we just talk? No. Leave me alone. Your application for permanent settlement in the UK. I can stop it or expedite it. You know I can. Look, please just get in the car, or do I have to shout through a window? Good afternoon. Please do feel free to return if you have further questions. - Thank you for your time. - You're welcome. - What happened? - Let's go. He's gone AWOL. No one can get in touch with him. So, what now? I can't accept second-hand evidence. This young man needs to make a statement if I need to pursue further. But you just said he's gone missing. The guy's an asylum seeker. He could have gone back home. The whole point of seeking asylum is that you can't go back home. Isn't your job to protect people? It is. And I'm trying to protect you, Lizzie. What were you doing outside Hector Blake's house anyway? I think now I know how Toby must have felt. Please let me out. Come on! Please let me out. Why are you doing this to me? Let me out of here! Please let me out! Hey, Faisal, can I call you back? Hi, Lizzie. I just wanted to say I cracked the USB password. - Really? - Yeah. - What's on it? - I didn't look. Client-counselor confidentiality, you know? Hey, babe. There he is. Ah! Lizzie. It's good to see you. You too. Look what Lizzie brought for Aydan. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you, Liz. You're welcome. Hopefully, you can use it for a few years. Oh! Aah. Oh, he's such a lovely boy. Oh! Aye. I know, you're so lovely! Are you also a little bit stinky? - Oh no. - Oh! A little bit. A little bit! - Let me just go and change him. - Aww. So, how are things? Liz? We need to talk. I've been reading up on the "I Came By" taggers. Isn't that what you call them? How they break into rich people's homes and spray-paint the walls. I knew you were hiding something. How do you know that's me? Jay. Look. That's you! All right. What you gonna do with these? Did you two break into Hector Blake's house? No. No, I didn't. No. I swear. Did you tell Naz? She already knows something's up. I can feel it. These photos won't prove shit in Toby's case, okay? It's just gonna come up and fuck up my life. I want you to help me break into his house. What? Hector Blake's? I don't know if I can do it on my own. You've clearly done this before. Have you lost your mind? Technically, we wouldn't be breaking in. We'd be using a key. I saw him hiding one outside. Think about what you're saying. Look, you just make sure I get in all right. - You can just stand outside. Keep watch. - No. No way. I can't risk it. I've got to think about Aydan and Naz. Fine. Fine. Then get out. - Lizzie, come on. - Go on. You coward! - Look... - Get out! Look, calm down. Just... We can't give up on Toby. I'm not givin' up on him! But, Liz, if I, a Black man, get caught, I'll go down for years! You know that. Do it for me. You owe me. I came through for you every time you needed me. Every time your mum had one of her new fellas knocking you around. When she kicked you out. Toby and I have always been there for you. You've been family to me. Yeah. But... I can't. Just get out. Where's Lizzie? She's left. Just like that? Aydan asleep? - What did she want, Jay? - Hm? What did she want? She came to see Aydan. Do you have any respect for me? Of course I do. So, why do you act like I'm stupid? - Wait, wait, wait... - You did some work at Hector Blake's home. And months later, Toby shows up at our door, panicked, the night before he goes missing. Then I hear from Lizzie that Hector Blake is a suspect in Toby's case. - What mess have you got yourself into? - No, no, no, no, no. No mess. Listen, Jay, if I have to be Aydan's entire family, I bloody will be. - Why are you saying that for? - Because you're scaring me. When my folks said it's either them or you, I said "Fuck it." - Yes, because we love each other. - But I feel like I'm on my own here. You think you just tattoo my initial on your hand and that's it? Job done? Naz, please. Everything I'm trying to do, okay, it is for us. There is no us if you keep shutting me out! I know, but... No! Fuck off! Hey, baby. Hey... No, stop! Hel... It's for you. Go to Mummy. Sh, sh, sh, sh. What is it? Nothing. Yeah. Don't know why I bothered. This is your doing. Where's my son? I flushed his ashes down the toilet. What? I have to cut him up to fit him in the kiln. You're smaller. It'll be easier. Hi, this is Elisabeth Nealey. - Leave a message. - Liz! I will probably call you back. Hey, Lizzie. It's Jay. Again. Look, this is probably, like, the 15th message I've left you over the past week. Liz? I've come over a few times. You haven't been in. In fact, I'm not even sure you've been at home at all. Look, I just wanna say thank you for the package, and I'm very sorry for not telling you everything. Please just give me the peace of mind and let me know you're okay. I'm gonna stay with my friend Katie for a few days. I'm taking Aydan with me. Gives us time to figure out who's moving out. What's wrong? It's just that... Lizzie's gone, and... it's... it's my fault. - What? - It's... it's my fucking fault. Jay. Hey. Hey. Hey. Thanks very much, everyone. See you next week. Have a great weekend! Hey, Philip. Hey. What are you doing, crazy? Who is it? It's Mummy. It's Mummy! - Hey. - Hey. - Are you gonna invite me in? - Yeah. Sorry. Hey, mister! Oh! - How are you doing? - He's excited to see his mummy. - How have you been? - Yeah. Livin' it up. As you can see. How's your dissertation coming along? Um... I wasn't sure if I should tell you. Hector Blake's gonna read it. Philip said their school's tercentenary celebration's coming up and he's gonna hand him a hard copy when he sees him there. - How does he know he'll be there? - He'll be there. He's donated shitloads to that school. They're paying him some kind of tribute at the ceremony. I hope this helps. Thanks. Hey, it's okay, mister. Come here. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, shh. Shh, shh. Please be careful. Okay? Aydan needs his dad. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. Wait, wait! Naz! Do you think, um... Do you think me and you still have a shot? I don't know, Jay. "The world is in a bad state." "But everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best." These are the words of the psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. And in my opinion, they so aptly describe Sir Hector's mission in life, for he is a man who has never ceased to do his best. So, gentlemen, without further ado, please welcome Sir Hector Blake! - Yes! - Yes! Hear, hear! Yes. Thank you. Well, thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of introduction. You know, I can remember as if it was yesterday my very first day as a boarder here at Birlstone, at the junior school. A young boy, not yet ten years of age, but knowing then that I'd found sanctuary. And I must say, it feels so good to be back home. - Well said. - Very good. Hector! What did you do to them? What did you do to them? Tell me! Where are they? Where are they? I've called the police, and they'll be here soon. Do you understand? Yeah? Okay, good. Can you walk? Good. Don't worry, you're safe now. Jay? What's happened? Are you okay? Through here, Sarge.
