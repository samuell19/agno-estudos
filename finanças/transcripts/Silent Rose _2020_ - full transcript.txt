}[Shatira] I'm gonna tell you this story. }And this is why I came, so, like, }one with myself. }So I really honestly do feel }like one with the universe, like, I feel like }I'm more than just }a brain that's functioning }with all these organs, and, like... }You know, it's really crazy, }sometimes I feel like I'm... }[laughs] I can hear my blood, like, rushing through my body. }It's really, like, if you really sit there }and, like, silent, you can like... }you can hear it sometimes. }[school bell] }[indistinct conversations] }[Karen] Hey guys, how's it going? }Uh, I am Ms. Karen. }I'm going to be taking over for Mr. Vernon. }Um, and obviously this is my first day. }It's not yours, you've been in school }with each other for a long time. }So, yeah, we're not gonna be very formal. }You just call me Ms. Karen. }Um... so that's... that's cool, I hope, with everybody. }And I have no idea who you are, and you have no idea who I am. }So I'm gonna pass out some little cards right now }and if you could pull out, like a pencil, }or a pen or something... }So just take like five minutes and fill out for me }just a little brief synopsis of who you think you are. }Anybody seen The Breakfast Club? }Anybody? Anybody? }[Shatira] I don't know. }I don't really wanna know who I am. }I just wanna be... be. }[laughs] I just wanna be. }Can I just be? Do I have to define myself? }[electronic music] }I do say I'm a photographer. }I mean, I don't know. }[stutters] I say I like taking photos. }[laughs] I will say I love photography. }So, like, I can't... I haven't found my... }I haven't found my thing yet, but... }I will. }Eventually. }[Mitch] What is it }that you wanna say with photography? }Like, why is that interesting to you? }I don't know. I just... }[sighs] I don't know. }Man, I don't know. }I just... [laughs] }[Mitch] "You gonna stop with the fucking questions?" }No, it's 'cause, like, everybody always asks me that. }And I'm just, like, I really wish I could tell you. }But sometimes I just like to fucking pick up a camera }and just take a picture. }Is that not enough? Like... }[tapping on keyboard] }And then I just started to say, }"This year we will be documenting }our school's environment and the process we undergo }as we open our arms to new students }from across the district. }While it's important not to feel }that you are acting for the camera, }they are interested in your authentic selves. }I know that you will do your best }to make a good impression }and represent our school... }faithfully." }'Cause the goal is not to... }turn everyone's attention to the new students, }um, and understand that they are all }here because they're diverse. }[Mitch] How do you think it's gonna go? }I think it's gonna go great. }[electronic music] }[guard] I think everybody kinda sees a security guard }uh, in whatever capacity, }in an office building, in a school, }as somebody who's just doing a job. }Oh, they're probably, you know, }"They didn't make it in law enforcement," }or, "They just need to make a few bucks }and they don't take it seriously." }But what if you're a person }who does take it extremely seriously? }Whoa, whoa, whoa. }We don't do that here. }Put them away. }[upbeat electronic music] }We're getting filmed. }[rap beat] }♪ Imma pull up in this swoop ♪ }♪ Then you're gonna dive In my pool, yeah ♪ }♪ I just been working on you ♪ }♪ You just been working On me, yeah ♪ }[music ends abruptly] }You wasn't supposed to cut off, 'cause I still gotta sing it. }Gotta sing it through. }-You sound hesitated. -[Marquel] Just doing it. }You sound hesitated as hell. }'Cause I am hesitating as hell, }there's a big-ass camera in my face. [chuckles] }You supposed to act like it's not there. }[muffled rap music] }[friend] I wanna hear the [unintelligible]. }[rap song playback] }-Hold up. -[music ends abruptly] }-Huh? -[woman] There will be lessons. }And they hear everything. }All right, we'll turn it down. }-[woman] How can they hear? -Oh my God. }-[mumbles] -Yes, ma'am, we got it. }[background chatter] }[Marquel] So when I don't have my keys, }this is what I do, this is, like, }we came up with this plan. }[rap music] }She up there? }Hey Gram. }[keys clink] }Easiest way to get in. }This floor full of old people. }That floor full of potheads and my grandma. }[Marquel indistinct] }This is Mitch, he's filming me. }-This is my grandma. -How are you? }-Good, how're you doing? -[Mitch] I'm fine. }So what you been doing? }Uh, working, school. }[grandma] So what you all got, a class project? }Uh, no. He's actually making a movie, }like a legit movie, you know how that goes, so... }[grandma] Are you? }[Mitch] Describe your relationship with Shatira. }Uh, why did you hit me with that question? }I don't know. }It's just, like, we've liked each other }back and forth, like, }sixth, seventh and eighth grade and stuff. }And every time I would ask her out as a girlfriend, }she'd play me and be like, "Oh yeah, we can date." }And then she would say no, and it would irritate me, }and then she's played me multiple times, but... }Honestly, like, that's somebody, like, you can trust. }Like, for sure, I'll say that, }like, I know for a fact that I can trust her. }If I, like, needed advice or to go to her for something, }like, that's like, she's a... }She's a good person, she has a good, like, soul. }-[Mitch] Yeah. -For sure. }[Mitch] Like, how else would you describe her? }Awesome. }Like, uh... }intriguing... }I don’t know. }There's a lot of beautiful people }that are, like, really honest, and she's one of them. }So I'd say that... }All right, Grandma, I'll see you later. }[grandma indistinct] }...peppermint from the dollar store. }-Want me to grab you some? -Okay. Huh? }-Want me to grab you something? -No. }-I like the puffs. -[sighs] }They're called puffs. }-Thanks, I'll see you later. -[grandma] Okay sweetie. }-I'll catch up with you. -[Marquel] We will. }[grandma] All right. }[Robert] Can we get two chais and a hookah? }-Two chai? -[Robert] Yeah. }-What size? -[Robert] Medium. }-And a hookah?. -[Shatira] Yes please. }[Shatira] She was like, "Don't let them take pictures }of you smoking hookah. }You'll get us in trouble." [chuckles] }She's tripping. }[Robert] Why don't you sip your coffee? }-It's not coffee. -[Robert] Mind your business. }It's not coffee. }Don't say it's coffee, it's not coffee. }[Mitch] Who's Robert? }[Shatira] Robert is my boyfriend, }um, and we've been together for three years. }I love him, and I care about him. }And I don't understand }why it's so hard to be with somebody like yourself. }So, we're both complicated in our own ways. }[Shatira chuckles] Today was my day. }-Yes. -Yeah. }Uh, yeah, it was a little bit rough. }[chuckles] }It started with Marquel. }He drives me nuts. }No, no. I... }Just Marquel in general, like, relationships, friendships, }people in general have been irritating me a lot lately. }I'll be honest, }[stutters] in the beginning of the relationship, }I used to be super, really, really jealous }and now I just kinda, just, like, let it go, }'cause I just know she's gonna be with me }at the end of the day, so... }it's nothing, really, to worry about. }[Shatira] I don't think I've necessarily lied to Robert. }But I've... I don't feel like }I've always been... }like, myself... }Like, hon... like, not honest, }but like myself, I guess? So, like... }hiding what I feel, if that counts as lying, }but, like... }[sighs] }Tired of... }feeling. [laughs] }So, you know the alley }that all the kids walk down? }Somebody wrote that one time, and I was like, }"Oh yep, mood." }So... [chuckles] }Kinda just took a picture of it. }[Karen] All right, guys. }If you need a couple more minutes, that's okay, }you can go ahead and take it. For those of you that are done, }can you come and turn in your papers? }And also, you may grab your phones. }I'm sorry for taking them away. }I'm a little grumpy today. }To make up for it, why don't you guys just, uh... }have some free time to yourselves. Cool? }[students] Yeah. Yeah. }Cool. }So how many weeks can I expect }testing to be? }It changes on a yearly basis for us. }I don't know if we could give a finite amount of time. }[teacher] We couldn't do any test preparation }for the tests last year, 'cause nobody knew }what was on the tests, we had no idea. }When he said it took six weeks of instructional time }he's talking about it actually, literally, }took six weeks of instructional time, }six weeks of classroom time }for the kids just to take the tests. }It's been, for me, the big disappointment }of the Obama administration, }has been what a disaster education's been. }And I don't know any teachers, }or really anybody who feel differently than that, }-and it pisses me off. -[Shatira] Hi. }-I'm sorry. -[teacher] That's okay. }Go ahead. No, no, come on in. }-[teacher 2] It's totally fine. -[Karen] How are you? }-[Shatira] Good, how are you? -I'm doing good. }-[Shatira] I'm tired today. -You're tired? }-[Shatira] Yes. -It's Friday. }-[Shatira] I know. -[Karen] That helps. }How are your grades? }-My grades are good. -Yeah? }Yeah. }-Okay. -They're fine. }-It's fine. -And are you... }How are you feeling about this school? }I'm ready to go. }-You're ready to go? -I'm ready to leave. }[Shatira] I just feel like }there's this thing on Facebook where it's }look back at all your memories. }And I made this status where... }um, I was like... What did I say? }I was like... }I just walked up to a group }of predominantly white kids, }and I asked them if they knew who Trayvon Martin was, }and, um... }They said no. }I asked them if they knew anything }about police brutality, and they said no. }And so I just... }-I don't know. -Huh. }[Shatira] It's becoming harder to talk about. }Not much has changed. }[Shatira] Not much has evolved, at all. }Yeah. What if... }what if I were to give you and Marquel }an opportunity }to lead, in the classroom together, around race? }-[Shatira] I think it would be-- -Race relations. }[Shatira] It would be powerful, especially because we did start }the walkout together last year... }-Right. That's right. -...when Trayvon was shot. }[Karen] Do you think Marquel would be interested, too? }-[Shatira] He would love it. -Getting together, and... }-[Shatira] He would love it. -...come up with a lesson plan. }[Shatira] He would literally be in love this. }And I'm gonna need you }to speak up and lead the class, too. }-All the time. -[Marquel] I don't think this... }I mean, yeah, it's worth it, but... }For why? Why even start it now, because... }What, in ten years we'll be having }the same conversation. Shit won't change. }But we could change it in this community. }I don't want my whole high school experience to be like... }I was appropriated the whole time, }just squished, just condensed }into this tiny little box of stereotypes }and being this one person }that all these white people know me to be. }I want people to know, 'cause if we give }this small amount of people knowledge, }we could do that everywhere. }Like, imagine that, like, literally imagine that. }That'd be amazing. That'd be so great. }All these people know that we are all the same inside. }I hear so many people of color beg to be seen }and beg to be known, and beg to be heard. }But it took him so much convincing }even though he wanted that. }You know, I was down for it. }I was ready, especially, like, the whole election going on. }I was ready to talk about it }with people, and, um... }He was just really hesitant, because he didn't... }I guess he maybe felt like }he didn't have to explain himself to people. }And you don't. }[Mitch] Is there much censorship on the computers here? }There's like... yeah. }Yeah. Like, if I wanna do something like this, }I could go, uh... }Maybe you like cooking, maybe I wanna find }a nice duck breast recipe, right? }Maybe I got some duck breast, I wanna cook that. }Oh, look, pan-roasted duck breast at Food Network. }Oh, no. It's blocked. }"Pan-roasted duck breast" is blocked }because keyword "breast", you know? }'Cause that makes sense. }But if I go to, like, a different website, like... }World War One guns, }sometimes it's blocked "guns," sometimes it isn't, you know? }[scoffs] }The majority of the teachers are liberal }and the majority of the students are liberal, }but we have teachers that are openly conservative }and students that are openly conservative, }so I feel like, ratio-wise, it's right. }They also sort of feel attacked }by being surrounded by so many liberal people, }so they get sort of aggressive with their conservativeness, }and sort of alt-right with it, }which then makes the liberals get even more mad at them, }if that makes sense. }Oh my God! }She emailed me, }and was like, "I think you'll like this," }and I was like, "Oh God..." }[man] Because kids have always been miscreants }and juvenile delinquents, and they've been truant, }and there's been fights in schools, }and other problems, we've had violence in schools }throughout... as far back as we've had schools. }I'd read a story many years ago, }I can't remember the magazine, }but they're interviewing a young school teacher }up in a part of Alaska that had Kodiak bears. }Biggest bear, mammal, on the planet. }I mean, monsters. }And she had this little one room schoolhouse. }And she said }we're in bear country, we know it, they're vicious. }So when they go out... They said to go on recess, }every day there are four students }that are assigned a task: }one faces north, one faces south, }one faces east, one faces west. }They don't participate in recess, }they simply watch the trees and the surrounding area. }If they see a bear, they say there's a bear, }they get the kids inside the school. }And, uh, the comment was, well, what if the bear gets in? }And she had this closet }with a large caliber rifle in it, }and she said, "If the bear gets in, }-that's what I do." -That's the solution. }[man] What we need to think about in our society }and in America overall }is what do you do when the bear gets in? }[guard] Right. }[Diego] Take a shot. }[chanting] }I kinda have to pee. }-Let's go. -Dammit. }You always gotta pee. }He always gotta pee. }-He's like, I have to pee. -No, you don't. }-Hold it. -Hold it. }Yo, I thought you were gnarly. }Yeah, but I'm not about to piss on myself. }Just hold it. }So, apparently my parents don't like it }when I go out... }-So... -...of the house at night... }-Free Bateman. -...and get back in the morning. }-This is like the symbol for it. -I hate it. }So, like, "free Bateman," it's like that. }Now I'm in trouble. }I'm on house arrest, I can't go anywhere. }[Marquel] Quesadilla. }[Diego] Cooking in the kitchen. }-That's so much better. -[Diego] Is it? }That's so much better. }Yo, it's just the way it hits, it's so much better. }But I, like, wasn't laughing. }That's how you know it was serious. }-[Diego] Yeah, you were. -Not when Shatira's crying. }I was like, shit, what should I do? }You probably should have stayed away }just a little bit longer }till she fucking broke up with that dude. }Because you know there'll be some fucking beef there. }-[Marquel] I don't-- -Now it's like, }I think that you should fucking go up to her }which, I think you already have, it's just... }Tell her, like, "Oh, you know, }let's just be on good terms." }Like, it's not worth, like, you guys having this little beef }where we're in the same room. }-Not even-- -[Diego] Literally don't even }let her talk, just tell her, just be like, okay... }-You can't do that. -[Diego] "We are good." }[Diego] Yes, you can. }Just fucking say, "We are good. }There's no beef. }I just don't wanna fucking fight you anymore. }You're right, I'm wrong, who fucking cares? }-Let's just be done." -But... }I'm not arguing, I'm probably gonna do that. }Okay? }-[Diego] You should do that. -You don't know. }Like, there's history more than just, like, this year. }[Diego] You like her? }-Yeah, you do like her. -Yeah, I have, I have. }-And she likes you, too. -[Mitch] Why not be together? }[Diego] Because she has a boyfriend. }She has a crazy-ass fucking boyfriend. }You guys like each other. I don't know why }she doesn't just drop Robert }and you guys just fucking be together. }I don't get that. }[smooth electronic music] }[Shatira] There's a bunny. }[Shatira] I did contemplate a lot }that we were not gonna end up }being together after senior year. }[Mitch] What's up with you and Robert? }Just still friends. }I mean, we still hang out a lot, }'cause it's kinda, like, hard to break up }after three years, and be like, "Okay, bye! }Adios. You were never part of my life." }So... }yeah, we still hang out a lot, but not as much anymore. }-[Marquel] What's up, Shatira? -Hello. }You interrupted my interview. }[unintelligible] }[Shatira chuckles] Yeah, you do. }You tend to do that a lot. }-[Marquel] Are you mic'd? -Uh-huh. }[Marquel] Are we gonna talk? }Talk about what? [chuckles] }-[Marquel] Are we gonna talk? -No. }I was in the middle of an interview }-and you just kinda rolled up. -[Marquel indistinct] }-What? -You know what I mean, though. }Oh, got you. Yeah, I guess. }Oh, God, Jesus. }He's more stressful than Robert is. }[Mitch] Are you attracted to him at all? }Oh God. [laughs] }I was not expecting that question! }I mean, I find him attractive, }and I was going to pursue him in a relationship }but he done fucked that up. }So... [laughs] }[Mitch] Are you nervous about today at all? }Yes, because I'm scared I'm, like... }I don't know. I don't keep up to date }on current events, 'cause I don't have cable, }so, like, I don't watch news or anything, }and I only see, like, news on Facebook and stuff like that, }and then half the time it's, like, fake. So... }Uh... }Current events... }Let's ask Siri. }What are some racial current events }going on in the United States right now? }'Cause we're not... [laughs] }Let me think about that. }American Civil Liberties Union }American crime event analysis, }racial profiling. Oh, I got this. }Let's go. }[background chatter] }[Karen] All right, welcome, welcome, everybody. }[Marquel] Yo. }[Karen] How's it goin'? }-[Marquel] What up? -[Shatira] Good. }-[Karen] Public speaking. -[Marquel] I know. }-Um, Marquel, Shatira. -[Marquel] Yeah? }[Karen] Class is yours. }[Marquel] All right, y'all. }[Shatira indistinct] }[Marquel] Obviously I'm the only black student in this class, }so we about to do something today. }-Okay, well, let's not start... -Um... }...the conversation like that. }We're gonna talk about race. }And I know a lot of y'all are uncomfortable about it, }so, let's conversate. }What's going on in this school right now? }Nobody? }Nobody. }Don't raise your hands, just talk. }Conversate. }[student] Um... }I think that's a pretty hard question to ask. }-Why? -[student] Just 'cause, I mean, }It's not like we're not gonna say anything }if we see a racist act, }or, like, if the conversation comes up, }but I think why most people didn't raise their hand }was because maybe it's not, like, }it's not something we're just talking about, }which it should be, but it's just, it's-- }-[Marquel] Right. -Yeah. }[Shatira] Um... }How do you guys feel about one specific teacher, }you might know who I'm talking about, }who isn't supposed to share their political views with us, }but she is Republican and she is voting for Donald Trump. }I feel like you can't really get mad at her }when there's another teacher who's got a poster of Obama }on his wall, it's like, you can't have it both ways. }You can't be like, it's okay if you agree with me, }and it's not okay if you don't agree with me, }you know what I'm saying? }[Marquel] Your phone keeps buzzing... }[whispers] This is kind of a little side conversation }that is happening. }You guys are about to get back into your test prepping? }Not today. }Marquel and Shatira, }they lead the class today. }-[Marquel] That's racism, dude. -[student] How? }[Marquel] That is... yo. }-Ms. Karen. -[Karen] Yes? }You see what they be sending in your class? }You don't want to see? Look. }Actually, cellphones need to get put away. }Why aren't you guys getting ready for your test next week? }Ms. Karen, I do suggest you go ahead }and get the ball rolling on test preparation. }-[Marquel I have a suggestion-- -[principal] I'd love to-- }-Marquel. -[principal] You know what? }-I appreciate your suggestion. -[principal] Marquel? }Let me tell you something. }Either you can come and talk to me after school }of your own volition }because you wanna have dialogue about this, }or I can make sure you come and see me after school. }Do you understand the difference? }-I understand the difference. -[principal] That's enough. }I'd really love to talk to you after class. }-[Karen] Absolutely. -Thanks everybody. }[Shatira] I was upset that the principal }kinda came in and fucked up the whole conversation. }But there was some... }tension between me and Marquel, because we didn't really know }what we were gonna end up being, or... }what was gonna happen... }I'm here! So go ahead }-and say what you gotta say. -[Marquel] You got the floor. }-You got the floor. -[Shatira] Why do I have it? }[Marquel] I told you it was going off-target. }[Shatira] You were the one that came to me first. }-[Marquel] No. No. -It was like, "Let's talk." }I thought what happened was real, }but apparently you don't. }I just wanna be on good terms, that's all. }That's all. }Well, Marquel, I don't know what else you want me to tell you. }Like, I really don't, like, }I'm tired of receiving messages talking about, oh, fuck you. }Basically, in all context. }I am, 'cause that breaks my heart, a lot. }Every time. }You really think this is just }about you being the one broken-hearted? }I'm not saying I didn't fuck up. }I said that just the other night. }I said that last night, in fact. }-You did? -Yeah, I know I did. }-You did? -So you want me to apologize? }-That's what you want? -That's what I said. }Okay. I'm sorry. }I apologize for everything that I've done to you. }Like I say, you're not even gonna accept it }-or think it's real anyway. -I said okay. }You didn't say okay, you looked away. }I said okay. }[chuckles] }-Damn, he heard it. -Jesus. }[melancholic music] }Oh. Hi! [laughs] }I didn't recognize you. }-How are you? -I'm good, how are you? }I'm good. }[Shatira] I have only ever really had }like a good relationship with one teacher }and I still failed their class. }But... [chuckles] }She also had, like, }the same personality as Ms. Karen. }So... }In class, Marquel sort of, like, steamrolled you. }-Dude? -Yeah. }-Okay. -[laughs] }And what about that? }Um, well, Marquel's stupid. }-What do you mean by that? -[laughs] }When he said that he was the only African-American }in that class, like... }I was a little dumbfounded, and I was like, me, too. }It kinda caught me off-guard, 'cause I was like... }They would push you in a way that wasn't babying, like, }They'd be like, "Oh no, you got this." }Like, "What are you doing? You know you're messing up." }And I know I need somebody that's gonna be, like, }"Tighten the fuck up and get your shit done." }You know? I feel like it's because }that's how my mom was with me. }What's your favorite sweet thing to eat? }-Favorite sweet thing to eat? -Yeah... }-Favorite. -Okay. Well... }-Here's the crazy thing. -Okay. }So I don't really like eating chocolate. }-Oh. -It's not like... }It hasn't been a thing for me for a long time. }-Who are you? -I know. }I know. [laughs] }-It's kinda crazy. -[Karen] Are you human? }[Shatira] 'Cause my mom's like a chocoholic. }-[Karen] Chocolate's amazing. -[Shatira] Yeah. }[grunting] }[grunts] }[guard] What if you actually really cared, }and, you know, you've taken that responsibility on }to the point where }if someone of these kids gets injured or hurt, }or, God forbid, killed in the school, }then I didn't take every action possible }to protect them. }Whatever the case may be, um... }It's on my back. }[ambient music] }I mean, }I think there is at least a metaphor }in the lifting thing of you've gotta take it }a little bit further }if you are going to be that protector. }What are you gonna do? Just have a cellphone, call 911, }wait with everyone else }if something bad happens, you know? }[exhales sharply] }[dogs whining] }So there it is. }I can open it up. }And it is... }an unloaded firearm. }Glock 19 nine millimeter. }[Mitch] And have you ever had to use it? }Had to use it? No. No. }Never. No. Thank God, no. }[Mitch] I mean, what would be a scenario }where you would potentially foresee using it? }[sighs] }Um... }How many times do we need to see }these kind of things happen around the world }to know that the threat is there? }And I mean, if you do have opposing groups, }somebody who would take on the role }of defending or protecting a group of people, }it would be nice to be able to be that person. }I don't know if it's a completely narcissistic thing, }but it would be nice to think }that your intention worked. And you know what I mean? }[video] Government was responsible }for protecting the citizens' right to liberty, }but Muhammad Ali brought attention to the failure }that the government hadn't protected those rights. }Muhammad Ali is a bold icon }that continues to be influential everywhere. }This was the draft of a legend. }[electronic beat] }That was awesome. }Thank you. }-Thanks for showing it to me. -We tried. }Yeah, there is a reason why I had to show you that. }I just want to, like, }so you could understand where I was coming from }and why I got upset. }It kinda... It doesn't... Of course, I didn't get drafted, }but it gives some context }and where I get inspired from, }and, like, why that upsets me the way she reacted. }-Like, come on. -It upset me too. }Like, let's be clear about that. }-That it really upset me too. -Yeah. Yeah. }That she shut you down in that way. }Yeah, respect is one of the number one things }my dad taught me. }[Karen] Did you feel respected by Ms. G? }Oh hell no. I felt like she was... }I felt she looked at me and was like, }this little ant needs to sit down, so... }I don't know. }The outcome of what that situation should be }is like, literally, she should be listening, }'cause you don't want to mute a voice }that actually has something to say. }I think you need to tell her that. }Yeah, I agree. I think-- }And I think if you admire Muhammad Ali }for sticking up for his rights and his beliefs, }and going to jail for it... }Marquel, you're not going to go to jail for this. }-You know? -[Marquel] You've got a point. }Hey, but... Yeah, I know that, but... }Like, when I first find out something, I’m obviously... }too pissed off }-to even talk about it. -[Shatira] Yeah. }That's why I'm saying, like, }it takes me a couple of hours to calm down }to just figure out what I want to say and, then... }Yeah, so it's not like a big mess, like-- }But you never do say what you need to say, like, }you just sit there. [giggling] }Sometimes I just sit there }because I feel like you'll get defensive }about it, and, like... }I mean... I... }Yeah, it does irritate me that you get defensive }over him, because... }I’m pretty sure I've done so much more for you }than him, and... }I never deny that. I never ever deny that. }I just don't want to see you fall in love with somebody else. }That'll hurt me too much, so I’ll be like, nah, }I’m done with this, fuck this shit. }I just don't wanna... You get what I’m saying. }Wow. }You know... }You just up and leave? }I mean, wouldn't you? Like, say we were single-- }[Shatira] But when I was talking to Marquel }you didn't leave. }Okay, that's because I had this feeling. }-[Shatira scoffs] -That shit would not... }[Shatira] Well, obviously shit would not work, but-- }-Exactly. -[Shatira] The key }to loving somebody is forgiveness. }-[Robert] Exactly, and that's-- -[Shatira] And you forgive... }no matter what. }[Shatira] Grasshopper, dude, I got all the... }That's not a grasshopper, that was a leaf. }[knocking] }-[principal] Hey! -[Marquel] How are you doing? }[principal] Good. How are you? }[Marquel] Not in the best mood. }[principal] Well I’m glad to see you came by. }Give me just one second }to finish this little sentence here. }[indistinct mumbling] }[Marquel] Okay. }So... }How are you feeling since I saw you last? }-[Marquel] Not good at all. -Okay. }[Marquel] I’m feeling disrespected. }I’m feeling like... }honestly, you don't care. }I don't know if you understand }what me and the students go through }in this school, and what we put up with, but... }I feel like there's just... }You're here and I’m here. }We're on two totally different levels. }Two totally different spectrums. }I understand what's going on more than you }with the social life. }-Tell me what's happening. -[Marquel] There's micro... }There's insults, there's harassments, }there's jokes constantly, non-stop. }"Oh, that’s some black nig-- would say." }White kids are saying the N word. }For what? }It's like... }we get here, where, "Oh, you've got to do the test, }you've got to do this, the curriculum, }you just focus on that," }but there's another layer to this whole school. }-There is... -You are absolutely right }that in a lot of ways }this school has not been prepared for your needs. }-And-- -It's not all about me. }I’m not focused on me. I’m open minded. }I’m thinking about everybody else, }-the next generation. -I know you're not focused }on you, and that actually what I’m asking you }to kind of shift a little bit. }-But I don't want-- -[principal] Now, hold on. }I want to make sure that in the first year }that we put our arms around a more diverse student body, }we don't have a dip. }-Do you know why? -[Marquel] Wait! }-Do you understand why? -[Marquel] Wait! }You're worried that the minorities }-are going to create a dip? -[principal] No. }[Marquel] See, this is where you lose me, }because we're not on the same page with that. }I don't understand why. }And if you guys won't care, }then I’m sorry, I'll do it on my own. }[principal] Marquel, hold on! -[Marquel] There's no way... }[principal] There's nothing about this conversation }that should lead you to think that I don't care. }I care about all... }Can you please have a seat? Please. }[Marquel] It doesn't seem like you do. }[principal] You're responsible for coming here to school, }thinking about your own success, and making that happen. }Okay? }I don't want you to get distracted }by a whole lot of things }that don't necessarily need your specific involvement... }[man] Do we have anything going on Thursday night? }-Oh, my gosh, buddy. -[boy] Yay! }Careful, careful, careful! }-[boy] Yay! -Thursday night, the ninth... }-No. -[man] Okay. }Do you want to see what I can do? }Whoa! }[indistinct] }[principal] Pretty good. Look. }You've got this line, and this line, }and this part of the line, but look, it's missing... }this part going like that. }-[boy] Okay. -[principal] Wait, over here. }Finish up your four. }No Mommy, actually, I want to do it... }[principal] Are you going to practice a four again? }-[boy] Um-hm. -[principal] Okay. }[TV dialogue] }[teen] Marquel's pussy-whipped. }[Marquel] Okay, but I’m not as pussy-whipped as him. }-No! Listen! -Oh, Marquel down! }His ass is whipped, his ass is whipped. }My ass... Listen! My ass is whipped. }-[all shouting] -[Marquel] But worse... Listen! }We're all whipped, }but we're not as whipped as this dude. }-I bet you gonna-- -Think about that! }[all shouting] }What? Wait, hold up. What? }-What'd you say? -[student] Yo, what? }-What'd you say? -[student] I was making a joke. }[Marquel] What was your joke? I heard the N word. }I heard "pussy-whipped," so I said you were whipped. }-No? -[Marquel] No, whoa! Hold up. }That shit's not funny. Take that shit back. }-It's not real. -[Marquel] Take that shit back! }-I take it back. -[Marquel] Take that shit back! }[all shouting] }[Marquel] Not you! Because that is not your word. }[all shouting] }[Marquel] Man, put him on the ground! }-[indistinct speech] -Hey! }[shouting continues] }Oh, no! }[student 2] He wasn't doing nothing. }[Shatira] I felt like, kind of, the crazy thing about... }the exhibit, was that, like... }He just did such simple things, and I was like, }I guess art doesn't have to be complicated, so... }I don't know. I feel like as a photographer }you only stand out }if you do things differently, and I’m not sure }I do do things differently in photography. }I think I do the same mediocre shit }that everybody else does in photography. }I just want to be more experimental }with my work, }and I don't know exactly how to do that. }-[clatter] -Oh, shit! }You want three and a half ounces of this. }Like that? }And a shot of this. }I've never taken a shot before. }So I guess we'll see how this goes. }All right, the moment of truth. }[Mitch] What's the moment of truth? }This, right here. }We'll see if I can get the darn thing on. }All right. Lights off. Is it time? }[laughing] Oh, shit! }This is not happening. }Nope. }I don't know how people do this. }I do not know how people do this. }[Mitch] Yeah, I can turn it back on. }How was it being suspended? }I slept all day and cleaned, and, like, cleaned the house. }I washed the bathroom, and... }swept, vacuumed everywhere, and I went to work. }[quietly] I’m cool here, turn it back on. }[rap music playing] }There's a problem with it. }It's distorted. That's what I mean. }I’m trying to figure it the fuck out. }I might just rerecord this shit. }♪ White on white On the Bronco ♪ }♪ Nigga's go high like Django ♪ }♪ Fuck with the exodus... ♪ }[rapping rapidly] }I'm a product of my environment. }We do what we have to do in certain situations. }That's just kind of how my upbringing is, so... }We have to push a person to that level }to where they don't care that much. }They don't care. I can't be punked anymore. }Mostly what happens, I’m like... }I could be in a different position }in two years when I’m in college, }and be like, I’m dropping out, focus on music and take off. }That's what a lot of rappers do. }[smooth rap music] }[background chatter] }[Shatira] So, it was the day after the election. }Everybody on Facebook was like, "What the fuck!" }-[laughing] -Like, it was, like, haywire, }and I didn't want to go on there. }I probably didn't go on there for, like, a couple of days. }Like, I just... }I tried to keep my spirit up, but at the same time, }I was, like, damn, like, racism won, once again. }What are you going to say? White privileged America. }So, that was crazy. }I watched it with my grandma, because she's been sick }and been living with us. She was just terrified. }She was like, "I do not want to live in this society." }And that brought me to tears. }I kind of just... I mean, I started a couple... }I did a rally with Jumper, and that was cool. }It was motivational }because everybody was crying on that day. }We were like we need to get the people together }so they can get their feelings out. }So we rallied up the whole school on the rotunda, }and had, like, a little... I don't want to say walkout, }but a little, like... conversation. }It was a group of kids. }Basically everybody was like, "Oh, let's do a walkout." }And then, Marquel loves to think he's in charge of it. }So, him and Jumper were like, }"Oh, we're going to do a walkout." }And then Marquel got mad. }[Mitch] Come on in. }Can you tell them that they're beautiful? }Really fucking weird! }[door closing] }[Marquel] Goddamn! I can't keep the door open! }-Jesus! -[door lock rattling] }Just smile the anger away. [laughing] }[student] I feel like there were just so many people }that the principal had no choice }but to allow the rally, you know? }I mean, all the security guards were very tense, }like, standing around, like... }As if something was about to happen, and... }People were crying. }People were sobbing. }I don't like the dude, }but this is a little overboard, you know? }It's not the end of the world. }What, four years, }and then it goes back to normal, right? }What's the worst he can do? }It feels weird editing this picture. }[Mitch] What did you say to him? }[student] I was walking by, }they were talking about being whipped, }and I was like, "Whipped, ha, ha, ha." }I made a joke. He... }Did what he did and turned it into a thing }where he's the victim }instead of me making a joke, you know? }Apparently now I’m not allowed to make jokes, }although he's allowed to make jokes. }If I make a joke I'm like a Nazi }or a white supremacist or something. }I never liked talking politics because I don't know anything. }I don't know about politics. }You know? Like, I know what the media tells me, }but I don't know about the policies }and all that shit, you know. }But I don't know, it's just dumb to ask me that, }because, like, the day that he got elected }everybody was, like, crying. }And that didn't... }-I didn't cry at all. -[Mitch] Why? }I thought it was darkly funny. }I don't know how it's going to affect me, }and I don't even know if anybody knows }how it's going to affect anybody. }Like, right now, it's, like, a school, }and, like, girls, and, like, social stuff, }and it's always been that way. }Like.... Act natural, Sarah. }All right, back to the interview. }Okay. }So, here's the thing, I’m mic'd up right now, }but once we go to the car I’m going to be not mic'd, }so you're on camera, but don't act weird, okay? }Just act like cool, okay? }Do a cool walk. Why don't we walk this way? }Oh, funny seeing you here. }Marquel and, like, Shatira as a main character, }and I’m like a side character, I think. }Because this is the first time I’m ever, like... }He's just filmed me. }[indistinct chatter] }[Marquel] People started being weird. }People started acting all... }In public, they started thinking they could be slick. }They started calling you the N word }when you was walking down. }Just a whole bunch of stuff, I think... }Like, some people just thought }they were more comfortable with being prejudiced }and discriminating. }[student] That is so terrible! }[video] ...put on a knit cap and some dark clothes }and get in his white Bronco, and this recognizable person... }...and how it didn't fit and how something's wrong. }-[Marquel indistinct] -It occurred to me }how they were going come here }and stand up here and tell you }how O.J. Simpson was going to disguise himself. }Was going to put on a knit cap and some dark clothes }and he was going to get in his white Bronco, }this recognizable person. }And go over... and kill his wife. }That's what they want you to believe. }[Marquel] That's okay. }[student] Yeah, "That's what they want you to believe." }So, there's a girl... }[video] He was going to put on a knitted cap }and some dark clothes and get in his white Bronco, }and this recognizable person, and go over and kill his wife. }That's what they want you to believe. }[fast music beat] }I felt like that came in way early. }[indistinct rapping] }[Marquel] Man, when you win, }when I actually first got on stage at the mic }and I had a DJ up, this is a show, }but it was more like, }"Well, you've got to start somewhere, }you've gotta do something." So, I've... }You know, they're not bad shows, they're just stepping stones, }they're baby steps. }Life is short, so we ain't got much time. }You got to make do with what you got. }And they play some cool shit. }That thing is bigger than a tablet. }[student] Yeah. }-[student] She's talking to you. -[Karen] Put it down. }-She's talking to me? -[Karen] Yes. }Who do you think I’m talking to? }Who else has a phone that's, like, the size }of an encyclopedia? }I mean, I like to learn. }So, we're talking about a fascist regime... }[clears throat] }And... }So, if they started making people wear bands }in this country, }denoting what denomination they were, }what color they were, what creed they were, }how they identified, }would that lead you to some sort of protest }to do something? }And it wouldn't have to be violent. }There are lots of different }non-violent resistance movements. }I mean, Sophie Scholl and the White Rose }in Nazi Germany being one of them. }She could have kept completely silent. }She didn't have to act. }She was only 21 years old. She was only 21. }And she knew the risks of distributing these leaflets. }She knew that she could be caught at any moment. }And they were, because in January of 1943 }the University of Munich had this huge riot }because Stalingrad had just been... }Well, the Germans had just been defeated }in Stalingrad. }So, University of Munich, }which was full of artists and critical thinkers, }just erupted with these huge riots. }[overhead speaker] This is district safety and security. }Your school is going into lockdown. }This is not a drill. }All students please report immediately to the nearest... }[Karen] All right guys, you know the drill. }Let's go. }This half of the room up against these... }filing cabinets. }Are you guys okay over there? }[Shatira] I’m sure it was either a threat }that somebody made, or there was a fight }where a threat was made. }it had to do something with a threat, }because otherwise they wouldn't put us }in a lockdown. }I texted my mom and I told her I love her, }and, you know... I waited. }Photography is all about capturing the moments }that are never going to happen again, and... }[camera clicking] }That's what I did with the photo of Ms. Karen. }It would have been crazy if something were to happen }and then somebody would have found my camera }and it would have been kind of dope }to have that be the last picture I ever took. }We all go into... }panic mode. }We have no idea, we have no idea, }if we have an active shooter on campus, }or if there is... }a direct threat to my class, to one of my students. }We have no idea what the heck is coming down the pike. }Yeah. }No, I can totally make that happen. }So, a happy hour? }Deal? Promise? }Don't flake on me, bitch. }[chuckling] }No, I know you wouldn't. }All right. }We'll get together then }and we'll talk more about this nonsense. }I’m scared. }I am, I am... I'm nudging. }Yep, well, I also shouldn't be put on, }like, some stupid probation or being, you know... }told that I can't sue. }Sit! }[chuckling] }Animals are the best thing in the world. }Do you know why? }Here's why: they don't judge you. }They don't judge you for anything. }[tense music] }[inaudible] }[Mitch] What are your thoughts when teachers just disappear? }What the fuck! [chuckling] }I just think it's unfair, like... }[stutters] We should... I think I have a right to know. }I don't think it's fair at all, that she's gone, honestly. }Especially if, like, they can't... }They're just coming up with stories }to keep her gone, basically. }They've probably wanted her gone for a long time. }She's a very outspoken person }and not a lot of people like that. }Conversations were supposed to be the solution. }I feel like that whole conversation }kind of stopped after she got fired. }And I feel like everybody is stuck. }We're just stuck. }[police siren] }[laughing] }I told you I was going to laugh. }-Here we go. -[Mitch] Why're you gonna laugh? }Because it's just awkward... }for me. }[Mitch] Why is it awkward? }Because we just don't talk anymore. }Our last conversation was... }when I told you... }it wasn't fair that you were trying for me now }when you could have been trying for me-- }Oh, yeah, that was high key, I remember that shit, yeah. }And then we never talked after that }because you got up and walked away. }[tense music] }[background chatter] }[lecturer] You don't do anyone any good }if you're doing a Hail Mary run }like the Charge of the Light Brigade }up against an active shooter. }So what you need to do }is you have to make sure you've got some tactics }and some capability to either contain }or track the movements. }That is time to act. You've got to do something. }You've got to either neutralize that threat... }You've got to have that wherewithal to do it. }Here's the other thing you have to consider, }is could you shoot... a child? }[solemn music] }That's a very difficult thing for you to think about }if you're carrying a gun and working in a school. }Can you shoot a child? }As a person responsible for the safety }and wellbeing of children, }you've got to be the adult in the room. }So, what you need to do }is you need to daydream and think. }No different than football players }or baseball players or anything else with a pop fly. }You may be working out in left field }and never get a ball the entire game, }but that one time you do, you've practiced, }and you thought it through, and you've brainstormed, }and you've daydreamed about what will happen }if the ball comes flying your way }and how are you're going to handle that. }[Shatira] This is the most devious thing }I've ever done in my life. }-[Mitch] For real? -Yeah. }I've never snuck out. }I don't smoke, I don't drink. }I've been grounded more than a handful of times, }but I've never been suspended or expelled. }You know, I feel like there's been a lot of times }in the past few years }where I haven't said what I should have said, }and I don't want to let things... }Well, you know, in terms of, like... }something that really affects me, }I don't want to let it be. }And... }Everybody's always like, "Oh, kids don't watch the news, }kids don't care about what happens nowadays. }Kids don't this, they don't that, }they don't pay attention. }All they do is pay attention on their fucking phones, }and yada, yada, yada." }And... }I just don't want to sit back anymore. }[foreboding music] }[music accelerates] }[Shatira] I don't know if I would call it a story. }I think I would call it a memory, }to be quite honest. }Because it's not something that's made up. }Yeah, my life isn't a story, it's more of a memory. }[man] Hey! Hey! Stop! }I've seen you! Stop! }[gunshot] }I feel like I kind of left the old Shatira, }and that's cool. }[needle buzzing] }I feel like I’m more afraid of the future }than I am of like, death, at this point, }because I’m like, damn, I’m 18 now, like... }Shit really happens, }like, you actually like, continue living. }[laughs] Like, I guess, like, all I thought }after high school was like death. }[chuckles] But now I actually have to go out and live my life }and be 30, flirty and thriving. }Like, I don't want to do that. }I've never planned on that. }I've only seen it in the movies }and I don't feel like it's realistic. }[electronic music]
