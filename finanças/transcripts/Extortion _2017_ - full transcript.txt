Andy, are you ready? Get up here. I'm done with my boat, mom. We're gonna be late to the airport. Please bring your bag down. I can't find it. Did you look under your bed? What are you doing up there? Babe you got the passports? Yeah, I got them. Daddy, daddy look. Yeah it looks good, the sail looks great. You almost got it. That's good. I checked the weather, not a drop of rain all week. I know, that's great. Hello. Can you take the luggage out? Honey, can you guys take the luggage outside, please? - Andy where's your bag? - I was saying, he has to... Andy. Where's your bag, sweetie? Yeah, I saw the X-ray. Well, schedule an mri and let's just wait to see what the results of the blood test are and we'll talk next week, okay? Email me his results. Yeah, thank you. All right. - Daddy. - Yeah? Are we gonna go on jet skis? Because Colin said he went on a lake and his dad let him drive a jet ski. Six year old Colin rode a jet ski by himself? He went 100 miles per hour. And he also said that his dad can kick your ass because you're a doctor. First of all do not repeat bad words after Colin. Secondly, doctors are pretty tough, you'd be surprised. And I highly doubt Colin rode a jet ski by himself. Then promise me we will go together then. I promise. Kevin, Andy, so you're finally leaving. Lucas, yeah. Jules found a really good deal in the Caribbean. We're gonna spend some quality time with the family. That's what vacations are for. And only because of you, Margie and I were able to spend our last vacation together. I know, I know, it's okay, you don't have to thank me. By the way Julie mentioned you can't start the lawnmower again. I'll tell you what, i could show you how to fix it. It's simple, it'll only take a second. It's a small engine, and they're all the same. I'm... I'm on vacation. I'm not fixing anything right now. Andy your father can fix a human heart but he can't fix the lawnmower. Be careful, some areas are not very safe out there. Thanks, Lucas, I'll keep that in mind. - Toodle-loo. - Have a nice week. Kevin, slip the concierge a little something extra he'll upgrade your room. Money... that's how everything works down there. Okay. Thanks. Au revoir. Daddy, what's a concierge? Daddy, is treasure island real? Yeah, for sure, hundreds of years ago pirates used to hide treasure on deserted islands. Why? So no one else could figure out where they hid it. Why didn't they keep their treasure at home with their families? Pirates don't have, homes, you know, or families. If they didn't have homes or family why did they need treasure? That's a good question. Hey, come here. What do you think? It's pretty amazing. It is pretty good. Yeah. Welcome. Hi. May I have your name and reservation number please? Kevin Riley. I don't think I'm really particularly good at this but if you were willing to upgrade our room, I would be willing to compensate you, personally, financially. Certainly, let's see what we have available. Thanks, man. So what do you think of the honeymoon suite? It's pretty great, nice to finally see one. Come on. Our honeymoon suite was nice. I'm sorry our honeymoon suite did you just say? Our honeymoon suite was a tiny bed in the back of an rv on the way to Mexico. So? That sounds like fun, it was great. It was the worst trip ever, that's what that is. I thought it was fun. I know you did. Love you. - Hi, there. - Good morning, how are you doing? - Good, how are you? - I'm good, I'm good. How can I help you today? I want to get a jet ski, please. Man, yep, I'm sorry but we're all out for today. You know the list is full, so sorry. Actually, if you can give me your name I can book you for tomorrow. No I get it, i get it, that's cool. Sir, sir we don't... Sir, we don't have any jet skis. Okay, my son, he's never been on one before and I swear to you it's all he talks about. So if there's anything that you could do it would be great. It would mean a lot to me. I'm not... you know what, I'm not even supposed to tell you this but... but you can rent a motorboat from one of the locals. A couple of kilometers down you'll see a bunch of guys and they have all kinds of boats, all right? Hey, mister. What you got there? - Five dollar fish. - No, thanks, nice fish though. Yo, my friend, you need a boat? - Yeah. - Only 300, bro. - Which one? - Right there the white one. Right here, my man. The fastest boat is right here. Yeah, right, give me 250. Three hours for $200. Give me 250. Come here, you gonna like it. Right here, right here come on. Just give me 250. Come on, come right here. - He says 200. Fun boat, you're gonna love it. - Go ahead. - Thanks, man. - I like this one. - How you doing, sir? - I'm good, how are you? - Fine, this is a good boat, man. - This is the fastest boat ever, okay? - Okay. That engine right there 60 horsepower. - Okay. - It came from a old sport boat. - All right. - Just $200 for three hours, cash please. Thank you very much. - You need my license? Get in, come on, no man, i don't need your license, come on. Okay. -What you gonna do, you gonna steal my boat? Maybe. -You can take it, I'll get insurance money. Don't worry, man, just bring it clean and I'm not gonna charge you a cleaning fee, okay? So sit down, I'm gonna show you how it works, okay? Okay, very simple okay, put the gear in drive. And you're gonna put the throttle control lever up and that's it you're ready to go. - Okay. - You got the life vests right there, okay. And make sure if you got kids put them on them. - Okay. And you got a full tank of gas, be safe. Now remember if you go swimming, remember to drop the anchor, okay? 'Cause when you come back you're not gonna see the boat again, okay. Have a good trip. You can steer it, here we go. - Babe. - Yeah? Where did you find this thing? Well they didn't have any jet skis but the good thing is this is safer and we're all together, right? I see how it is. These guys think they can take us What do you say we show them what we can do? - Buckle up. - Do it. Yeah, faster, daddy, faster. Bet you Colin never went this fast. Kevin. Kevin! - Yeah? - Slow down. Okay. Babe, listen, I think we should go back. We can't even see the land anymore. - No. - Yeah, we got two hours left, come on. I think it's gonna take us a while to get back. We should turn around. All right, you know what your mom is right. - Let's turn this baby around and we'll... - Sorry. Cruise around closer to shore, okay? - No. - I know, buddy, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a party pooper. It's safer. Island, island, i wanna see the island. Daddy, treasure island. I don't think it's a good idea. Mom, just for a minute, can we see the island? What do you say, mom? It's not every day you get to see a deserted island. Why don't we just check it out? And we'll go home and have lunch after. Yeah! Mom, please, please, please? Okay. Yeah, full speed ahead! Next stop treasure island! Daddy, look, palm trees. They're everywhere. Awesome. Come here your ears are red. Dad you think there's treasure here? You never know. You guys wanna take a walk around the island? I think I'm gonna sit down and read for a little bit, you guys go ahead. All right. Let's look for a buried treasure. All right, well, let's do it. - Get out of here. - Come on. You boys have fun. Let's do it, come on, let's find some treasure. What do you think? Awesome. Let's go see this thing. Let's see if we can make it all the way around. Cool. Whoa, a seashell. Dad, look. Wow, that's pretty cool. Take a look inside, see if anybody's home. Hello, darlings. Look, mom, we found a cool seashell. Ooh a conk shell, it's good luck you know. - Conk, can you say conk? - Conk. Conk shell, it's good luck, you ready? - I'm hungry. - Hungry, too. Let me help you up. - Who wants Sushi? - I want Sushi. Okay, how about, what do you say we get mom a caterpillar roll? Or a spider roll? What about a tarantula roll? What, no those are too hairy, i don't like those. How about some, start with some miso chorizo? Miso chorizo? Or some edamame salami? I don't think there's a crab there. Yeah, probably not. What's going on over there, hon? We run out of gas? - No, it's full. - Okay. I think that's supposed to be down. All right, come on. Come on, come on. I mean, anyways if anything there's... There's got to be a bunch of boats around. There we go. It's basically a lawnmower engine. Fuck, come on, come on. It won't be much longer, honey. All right, so how long do you think before they notice the boat is missing and they come looking for us? I don't know if they care if the boat is missing. I rented it from a local and paid in cash. He doesn't know my name or where we're staying. And he wouldn't want to report his missing boat to the police? I hope he does. Look, if it comes down to it, I'll put on a life vest and I'll swim back. You can't swim back, it took us an hour going whatever miles per hour we were doing to get out here. Can you even imagine how far out we are? I'm gonna keep looking for boats on the other side. You okay? Only battery's dead. I've been messing with the engine all morning and it seems fine. The fuel line's good, we got fuel. The engine's just... i don't know. I think it's the battery that's dead. I went around the island, i didn't see any water. I did see a boat a little while ago. Mommy, my head hurts and I'm thirsty. I know, sweetheart, but you have to stay out of the sun. Your father's asked you twice to stay out of the sun. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, chief. Everything's gonna be fine. Just like in the pirate stories. Did you know that when they used to sail these seas they would go for weeks at a time without food? And they didn't mind because it was... it was an adventure. Just like it is for us. So I want you to do what your mom says and I want you to stay under that tree and stay out of the sun and I want you to think about what you're gonna tell Colin about your big adventure on treasure island, okay? Okay? Look, boat, boat. Come on, boat. Hey! - Babe, boat, yo. - Hey! - Hey, hey! - Hey, hey! - Stop. - Whoo, help! - Stop! - Stop, help. - Help us. - Hey! - We need help. - Whoo, help! - See us! - Help, hey! Look over here! Hey, whoo! Hey, come here, it's okay. There's gonna be plenty more. That's just one. A boat is gonna come along and they're gonna get us okay? Now in the meantime, you get under that palm tree. Stay out of the sun. What are we gonna do? Well, we can last a couple of days without food. Someone's guaranteed to come by then. How long can we last without water? I can't believe, this is actually happening. Hey. I know I've been too hard on you. I'm sorry. Do you really think we're gonna be okay? Of course we're gonna be okay. I will not let us die out here. That's a promise. Jules... Jules, Jules. Jules, you got to wake up. His heart is racing, he's overcompensating 'cause he can't pump the blood properly. Andy, Andy! Damn it, goddamn it. Please don't let him die, we have to do something. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, we have to get off the island. We have to get out on the water. There are boats out there. Someone is gonna spot us. If we don't he's not gonna wake up tomorrow. None of us will. Baby, I'm sorry. I love you. I love you. Hello! Help! Help, help! Help, help, help! Help, help, help! My son and my wife they need water. Here, here, wet their lips. With what? It's fresh water. Jules. Come here. Come here. I got water there. No, no, put it on her neck, put it on her neck. The skin is thin there, it'll suck in the moisture. I'm a doctor. Exactly. Okay. Now get her wrist, get her wrist. Come on, water. We have water, we've got water. How long you been out here? A few days. - Days? - Days. What happened? We're staying at a resort and I rented this boat and then the engine just wouldn't start. Drifted out to sea and... But my son I need to get him to the hospital. He won't last much longer, please. Let me take the kid. Come on, babe, we're going home. I'm... I'm Kevin, this is my wife, Julie. And I just want to say we're gonna be forever grateful for what you've done for us. What is your name? Listen, man, i want to help you. I want to save you and your family, okay? Okay. But I would like a reward, you know, a compensation for saving your lives. Yes, of course, definitely. I swear to you you'll be very happy. Yeah, but I would like to agree on the price right now. Of... of course, anything you want. Ten... thousand. Forty, forty, that's everything that we have in our savings. I'll give you $40,000. How much is your family's life worth? I want one million dollars. I don't... I don't have a million dollars. But you're a doctor right? Yes, I'm a doctor but i work at a county hospital. We don't even make anything like that. Listen, man, i have a family, too. Y'all come down here and spend $10,000 on one vacation. That's more than I made this whole year, for four people. I need a million dollars or I'm leaving. - Make up your mind. - No, no, you can't leave us. You can't leave us, you can't be serious. We'll die out here. You said you have a family, and I've offered you $40,000. $40,000, isn't that enough? Not for me. -Wait, don't, don't, don't, don't. - Please don't go. - One million dollars or no deal. Wait, wait, wait, you can't leave my family here. One million dollars or no deal. I don't have a million dollars. My son is six years old you motherfucker. You can die here. Or we can go to town. Call one of your rich friends get my money and your family lives. I'll get money, just get us off the island and I'll get you a million dollars. - You sure? - Yeah. Good. Wake up. Where's my... where's my wife, and my... and my son? My son? Back on the island. Why? We agreed. Listen to me. We have to go to the bank and transfer the money. And then we go back to the island with the second boat so you can get your family. But they don't have any water. They had enough water, listen carefully. Think about your family, your family is on the line. You do anything stupid your family's gonna die okay? - Why are you doing this? - By the morning they're gonna die. - Shut the fuck up. - Don't do anything stupid. Don't tell the police or anyone else, because if you do i won't tell anyone anything. I will say this guy is a liar. Turn around go back, please. Turn around and go back, please. I swear to god, I'll still pay you the money. Just take me back, please. I swear to god I'll still give you the money. I'll give you the money! Let's make sure you do that. So I'm in town and I'm coming right now. Okay, alright. Just make sure you text me the account number right away. Yeah. Okay, good. All right, don't mess with me, man, I'm on the way right now. Jorge! Bye. There are thousands of islands back there. I am the only one who knows where your family is. So don't do anything stupid. Here, clean up. Jimmy, it's Kevin. I'm in a lot of trouble, i need money today. I don't even have time to talk about this right now but you have to do something for me immediately. I can't tell you right now. It's about Andy and Julie. Just wire it. You have my bank information, just get it to me. Put me in with Dr. zett's office, please. Can't talk about it right now, I'm in a bad situation. What do you mean? Nine zero five six four nine eight three. Hello, can you hear me? I need money. No, no, no, no, not next week, it has to be now. Richard, Richard, Richard, I've been waiting on the phone for you for ten minutes. Ten minutes I've been sitting here waiting for you. No, no, no, no, no, i cannot wait. I cannot wait! Yes! Get him on the phone, get him on the phone! Fuck! Lucas, Lucas, it's... it's Kevin, can you hear me? Listen, I know that you always said that you wanted to repay me for what I did for Margie. Well, now's the day. Take me to the bank. How can I help you? I need to check my account. Can I have your card? Thank you, Mr. Riley. Anything else I can do for you today? Have a good day. This wasn't the deal. You can either take that money now or you can take nothing! If you don't take my money, if you don't tell me where my wife and my child are, you're gonna be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your short, agonizing, miserable life, because I'm gonna take your face and break it in half with my fucking hands you understand me? I need to know that we have a deal. Transfer it. Anything else? Thank you. - Hello, again. - Hi. I want to transfer to that account number please. - The whole amount? - The entire balance. Sure thing. Yeah. Wired two minutes ago, you got it? Okay, okay, we're good. Okay, it's good. Okay, come. You can follow us in this one. Hey, why are you locking me in? Okay, for your own safety and everyone's. Don't communicate with anyone. - Open... open the door! - Listen, listen. When we get to the island I will let you out but first you have to wait one hour after we leave, then you leave. - No, open it up! - Don't worry. Hey, hey, I don't know how to get back, it's gonna be dark! Okay, Jorge, let's go. Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? I gave you all that money. I swear on my son's life I will never tell anyone about this. You got the money. What are you doing? Jorge, back, back, go back! Back, back. I will tell you, stay back. Please! I paid you the money! I gave you everything I have. Why are you doing this? Please just take me back to my family. I swear to god I'll never tell anybody. How do I know you won't tell your government? I won't tell anybody, I swear. You'll tell your government and they can look for me and arrest me, you think I'm stupid? No. I'll never tell anybody, please! Don't let them die! Don't you let them die! Please! You've got the money! Do not leave my family on that island! Please! Don't you let them die! Hey, grab the lifesaver, grab it. Pull him in, pull him in now. Mr. Riley, detective constable haagen. We spoke on the phone. The us embassy has been notified, and the us coast guard captain will guide you through the rescue plan. - How's your leg? - I'll live. Now we're right here, and these are the islands where you most likely made your initial landfall, and then you drifted at sea for at least one full day and night more likely going north northeast following the prevailing currents. They move at about four, four and a half knots. That potentially takes us out another 150 nautical miles from these islands. We have an initial search area. It's about 2,000 square miles, roughly the same size as the state of Delaware. And inside that search area there are hundreds of islands and keys. We can do this, it's just gonna take some time. Okay, realistically how long to search the entire area? A major search and rescue operation like this can take weeks. Weeks? They're gonna be dead before the sun rises, weeks? Mr. Riley, the ships are in preparation to deploy in about three hours. And that's gonna put us at this first chain of islands just before dawn. Don't helicopters have lights? Yeah, but it's virtually impossible to spot two unconscious people on an unknown island in the dark, even with night vision. There's nothing we can do right now. What about the fisherman? We have to focus on your family and then we'll find the fisherman. Why don't we go for the fisherman right now? Let's talk alone, please. How do you suppose we get this guy? You don't know his name, you don't know the vessel hull number. I told you on the phone his name is Jorge. Jorge. Mr. Riley, be realistic. Most likely, Jorge, is a Cuban migrant. Most deckhands are immigrant workers with no records at all. I bet the fisherman is a migrant himself, probably Haitian. - What about the bank? - We have the video. We're looking into the wire transaction and the receiving account as we speak. But this is the Caribbean. I'm sure you know that there's a lot of shady stuff going on in these banks. Have you had any arguments with your wife lately? Why do you ask? Does your wife or your son have life insurance? No... Yes, with our credit union. Where did all the money from your account come from? - What difference does it make? - A big difference. You rented a boat from a local man away from the resort. You don't have a witness that saw your wife or your son get onto that boat. Days later you show up at a bank to complete a wire transfer to an offshore account accompanied by a mysterious fisherman. Mr. Riley, is there actually a fisherman? Is it possible that your family was not on the boat as you said? Are you serious? You're wondering if I'm lying? You're wondering if I would do something to harm my six year old son and my wife? I don't know who the fisherman is, but I know he left my wife and my son on an island to die. Right now they are dying of severe dehydration and thirst, unless we go out and save them. You look exhausted. You need to get some rest before the search starts tomorrow. I'll take you back to the hotel. We're going to find your family, Mr. Riley. We're going to find them. I have a family, too. Text me the account number. There are dozens of islands back there. I am the only one who knows where your family is. - Damn it. - Checking out the scores? Yeah me, too. I tell you, it's the only thing that keeps me sane. Family has fun and whatnot and we go to the beach, and... But I've been stuck, you know, with my wife and the kids in the same hotel room for a week now, you know what I mean? Don't get me wrong, you know, it's a nice place. I like it here, the family does. You fish? Big game fishing, one of my favorite sports. I placed third in this one. You know, I also fish marlin... What do you do with the fish after you catch them? Throw it back in, or sell it. Who do you sell it to? Fish suppliers. Thank you. Hey, anytime. Detective, if this guy's a fisherman then he has to have a buyer. He's got to have somebody that he sells his fish to regularly and I think we can track him that way. Do you know how much resources it would take to do that? And if by some miracle we do track him down through the buyer, there's no guarantee that the fisherman will talk in time to save your family. - I'll make him talk. - The plan is to search and rescue. We do not have all the resources possible so you have to bear with us. Let me jump in here. Mr. Riley, let me introduce myself. I'm Brian sweeney, I'm deputy chief of mission United States embassy. - Can I have a word with you? - We're on the case, okay? Look, I know the detective personally. He's a good man, he's been around the block. Let's let him find the fisherman, all right? But in the meantime I need every available resource out there searching for your family and that includes you. You have the 100% cooperation and backing of the United States embassy. - Let them do their job. - Thank you. - Okay? - Thank you. Hey, Mr. Riley. - Yeah. - Don't go too far. They're expecting you at the base in an hour. I'm just gonna go up to my room, I'll be back in a minute. In an hour, Mr. Riley. Hey, can I get a taxi? Right away. Taxi. Thank you. Where to, boss? Where do fishermen sell their fish around here? We can go to the market if it's still open. - Let's go. - All right. Excuse me, I'm looking for a couple of fishermen that may be doing business here, one is... Haitian. He's really thin, he's probably 40 years old, average height, do you know somebody like that? I don't know anybody, there's this guy named Roger. He knows all of them. Maybe you can catch him at the loading dock. - He drives a brown Van. - Thank you. Thanks. Hey, stop the Van! Hey, stop! I'm sorry, man. I was told that you might be able to help me with something. I'm looking for a couple of fisherman who probably do business here. One is Haitian and he's got a guy he works with. His name is Jorge, he's latino. Does the name ring a bell or...? - No, man. - What about the boat? Pretty rusty antennas going... I been doing this for 30 years, I would know. No one we deal with comes to mind. How do you know those guys are here at the market? There are hundreds of boats and owners all over the islands. What if I were to hire somebody like a deckhand, you know, somebody to work on my boat for me with me? You can try the... The harbor in the morning. Okay, night fishing. What if i wanted to hire someone tonight? How would I do that? If you are desperate there's a bar by the harbor. They all hang out there, easy. Hey, man. Guys, excuse me. Hey, um, I'm looking for a guy by the name of Jorge. - Do you by any chance know... - What do you need? What do you need? Deck hand for my boat. Got a couple of guys here you know? No, no, it's okay, I just want to hire the guy Jorge. - Do you know him? - Yeah, that guy, blue shirt. Jorge. Yes? Sorry. Haagen. Detective are there any leads on the fisherman? Where are you? This is starting to look very suspicious. What are you not telling me? I cannot just sit on my ass and wait for the sun to come up. I need you to tell me where you are, immediately. Okay, you know what, you call me if there's any further developments. I'm telling you, my friend, something's going on. From the first time I saw him i know something was wrong. Yeah. What's up, boss, where to now? I don't know. What you looking for, man? Do you want some girls? - No, no, girls. - Okay. Here, you know what, I'm gonna give you 100 bucks just to wait. - No problem, man. - Where'd you get that scar? Man, I was cooking some swordfish and a bone sliced it, almost cut my finger off. Where did you get the sutures? - What? - Stitches, who fixed you up? They did it at the hospital, man. Which one, how many are there around here? There's only one. Excuse me, I have a leg wound that is showing signs of infection. - Please, first door. - Thank you. Okay. Please, listen to me. A few days ago, I took a boat ride with my family. We got stranded on an island and a fisherman asked us for a lot of money to save us. He took me back to the shore and he left my wife and my child on the island. After he received the money he tried to drown me and then he just disappeared. My wife and my son are still out on that island, and they have severe dehydration right now. The fisherman is Haitian about 40 years old. - He's very thin really, really thin. - Sir, please. He's average height, but he's got a deep laceration on his inner tricep and the sutures are fresh. They can't be more than a week old and I think that he got them here. I need, I need his information. Look, look, I'm a doctor, too. Good, then you should know i can't do that. I didn't come here for treatment. That man is the only person who knows where my wife and my son are. - Sorry, sir we can't... - Listen to me, the only person... Sir, we can't give out any patient's information unless you're a police. You should know that, you're a doctor, right? He'll never talk to the police. The only person he's gonna talk to is me. Look, that's my wife, that's my wife. That's us, that's my wife and my son. That's my wife and my son. That man is the only person who knows where my wife and my son are. He's not gonna tell the police anything. I need his information for myself. - Sorry, sir. - Please. I can't do that. Yes, you can. I can't do that but I'm going to step out for a minute, okay? Dr. clergen, we need your assistance. Dr. clergen, we need your assistance. Please dial in at once. "Miguel kaba." I got you, you son of a bitch. I want you to wait here. A man is going to come with me. If you don't ask any questions I'm gonna give you another $100. Who's this? I'm looking for Miguel. Who's this? I need a man with a boat. I was told down in the Marina by some guys that he's good, so I want to hire him. Go away, go away now. I'm not gonna hurt you. Do not touch my daughter! I just need to know where Miguel is. I don't know! -I swear to you, I'm not gonna hurt your child or you. I just need to know, where is Miguel? I don't know, i say I don't know! I know he lives here! - Get back! - What about Jorge? - I don't know. - Where is Jorge? I know you know Jorge, where is he? I don't know, i don't know, I don't know! Where is he? Where is he? Gpc 9243. Take me back there. I don't know what you're talking about. Take me back there right this fucking second. You kidnapped my wife and my son! Fuck you. - Take me back there! - Fuck you! You're fucking taking me back. You have to take me back there. Take me back to my family! Take me back. Let him go, now, now! Papa. Go back, go back! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. - Let her go! - Put that thing down! How does it feel? Swear to god somebody's gonna get hurt! Put it down! You put it down! No, no! I'm gonna fucking kill you! I'm gonna kill you. It's a gruesome scene at that house. That was self-defense. Listen to me, i have the hull number. That means we can locate Jorge. Mr. Riley, you're responsible for the murder of two people, including a little girl. - That was an accident. - You're hereby held into custody, you held her at knife point before slitting her father's throat. No, i... I didn't kill her, i did not, I'm innocent. You transferred a large amount of money and were implicated in a double homicide after that. The fisherman made me transfer the money. There's a boat sunk in the sea. What do you... What do you think I did? You think I tried to fake drown myself in a boat? Well, it looks like you were either involved in a money laundering scheme, or you paid the fisherman to get rid of your family and then you got rid of him. I'm not talking to you anymore. I'm not talking... - I'm talking to him. - Be my guest. Listen, I got the number for the boat. You need to stop talking right now. All right, this no longer a missing persons investigation. This is now a homicide, you need to get a lawyer. - Gpc 9243. - Are you listening to me? That means we can get to Jorge, we can make him lead... -Our office can prevent... Forget Jorge, Mr. Riley, the search has been called off. - Okay, the search is over. - What, why? Why? Because you're an American citizen who is in custody and they just think you murdered two of their nationals, that's why. What are you gonna do, you gonna leave them out there to die?! It's not what I'm gonna do. Mr. Riley, there's nothing I can do. They no longer believe that your story is credible so they are calling off the search. Okay, you got to understand that this is a tourist nation, all right? They rely heavily on tourists. I don't give a fuck! Okay, listen the last thing they want is a media shit storm that they think is started by someone who they consider a murderer. All right, so just take my advice... What do you think I'm doing? Why do you think I'm lying? You have got to keep your mouth shut! What makes you think I'm lying? No we went to a hotel, we checked in, my wife and son, then we went on a ride... Mr. Riley, I'm trying to help you. And then the fisherman... I'm trying to help you. -Left my wife and my son... There's nothing else that i can do for you, listen. - To die, to die! My hands are tied. I'm trying to help and I am going to do... what if you're wrong? What if you're wrong? It doesn't matter. Mr. Riley listen to me. You're gonna have blood on your hands, man! Listen to me, you are under investigation. You're gonna have two innocent people. You're about to get transferred, you are gonna get transferred to a secure facility where you will receive medical treatment. Just take him away, please. Mr. Riley, Mr. Riley calm down. Jesus Christ! - Get back, get back. - I got back. Get back, uncuff me. - Uncuff him. - Get back! Okay. I did not kill that girl! It was an accident! And my wife and my son are out there! - I... Kevin, I believe you. - No, you don't. You follow me... I'll shoot. I'll shoot. He's armed and dangerous. Kevin! All units on a high alert. - Good morning, guys. - Good morning. I don't mean to be rude, I'm just in a real hurry. - Yes? - Last night, I was out with a couple guys and they told me they're going shark fishing and I've actually never been before and I kind of missed them this morning and I don't know where their boat is. So I kind of need to know where it's docked. I can't help you without a last name and a hull number. Miguel kaba is his name, and he mentioned that the hull number was gpc 9243. - Good morning. - Good morning. Miguel kaba, number c-four-four-zero-zero. - Slip 37, compass king. - How do I get there? You have to take the north ferry, - it's about an hour from here. - Thank you. Wait. Actually, the lease was terminated on the slip yesterday. Are you saying that the boat isn't there? That's right, man. Sorry, but your fishing trip might not happen after all. You know you can rent a boat from one of the locals if you want. Everything is coming, I promise you. We'll go over everything... I'll be back in the office in a couple hours. United States embassy. Yes, sir, yes, please hold. Sir, sir. -This guy is on an island with limited recourse. - Sir! - Get his wife's credit card... what? It's him, line two. Mr. Riley. Jorge has a cell phone. Mr. Riley you have got to understand... The fisherman called Jorge on his phone when we left the bank. Being on the run, you are making your case infinitely harder. Jorge definitely has a cell phone, so the only way I'm gonna give myself up is if you... you trace his calls, you get him, you bring him to main square at noon, and you have yourself, the police and a translator. That's the only way I'm gonna give myself up, do you hear me? Mr. Riley, I promise you, i am gonna do everything in my power to help you out but I want you to do me one favor. Don't do anything rash, okay? Mr. Riley? Mr. ri... Amber. - Haagen. - You think you can outsmart me? I told you i would give myself up but only if you let me see Jorge. If you don't, you're never gonna catch me. We called Jorge's number, whoever picked up got spooked. The signal disappeared. If it was Jorge then he's probably on his way off the island for good. Kevin, I believe you, but you're wanted for murder. In order to help you, i need you to turn yourself in. Otherwise you're gonna spend the rest of your life running. Kevin. Kevin. Jorge? - Jorge! - What's going on? Stop the bus, stop, stop the bus. Jorge, stop! Jorge, stop! Jorge! Stop! Stop! Stop! Jorge, Jorge, stop. My family, please. My family! Familia, familia. Familia! Please, no... No policia, no policia. My family, where is my family? Please. Get back in your truck. Move it a few feet forward. Couple feet, that's it, that's it. - Call for help. - I don't have a phone. Jorge, Jorge. Jorge. Where is my family? Look, where is my family, are they here? Are they here? Look on this map. Where is my family? Which island, which island? Jorge. Jorge. Jorge! You have to look! You have to look! Which one? Is it that one? Or is it this one, which one is it? Where's the closest Marina? I'm taking your truck. Where's the hospital? Help me get him in the truck. Take down the gate. Hey, hey, you take him to the hospital. Drive fast or he's gonna die. Sir. Can you take me to this island? I'll pay you. How long will it take us? I have to take her to fill up first. By nightfall, if we're lucky. All right? - Guys? - - What's up, man, how can I help you? I'll pay you a lot of money if you take me out to the island. Nah, man, we're all right, we're good. Shit for five grand I'll take you anywhere, bro. - Fine. - You got cash on you right now? I'll pay you in full tomorrow. I don't know you like that, man. Get the fuck out of here, man, with that bullshit. You hear this dude? Get in the back, babe. No, man... you get the fuck out of here. Yo, calm down, brother. This is my dad's boat, all right. Calm down, he's gonna kill me. Get out! Untie it untie it. Yeah, he just took my boat. Nah, some guy just got on with a gun and took my dad's boat, you don't get it. He just ran off with it, he pulled a gun on us. It's a yellow speedboat. Stolen vessel description. I repeat, stolen. Yellow twin engine powerboat. Suspect is white male, late 30s. This is harbor patrol. Shut off the engine. Shut off your engine, immediately. This is harbor patrol. Shut off your engine, immediately. We will open fire. This is your last warning. Engage, engage, engage. Julie! Jules! Jules! Baby, I'm here. Okay, let's get you some water. Just a little. Just a little. Just take it off my finger, that's it that's it. Daddy's here, I'm here. Come on to daddy, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, Andy, come on, come on. Come on, boy, come on, come on, come on. Come on, boy, come on, come on. Come to me, boy, come. Come to me, come to me. Come on. That's it, that's it, that's it. I'm right here, boy. Good, okay.
