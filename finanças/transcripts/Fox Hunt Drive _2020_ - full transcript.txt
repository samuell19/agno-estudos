Where are you? Chaos is the natural state of things. To have a plan, to have a direction, a blueprint, to strategize. That is the foundation of progress. With careful and thorough forethought, there is no problem that can't be overcome. Hi. This is Alison Meyers. I'm following up about the job opening in your design department. No, I... I already submitted a résumé. No, I... I understand. Thank you. Rhythm, data, hierarchy. Principles by which the chaos of life can be organized. Hi. This is Alison Meyers. I'm just calling about the job interview that I had at your firm last week. I was wondering if anyone's begun scheduling follow-up interviews? It's already been filled. The axis. Symmetry. Transformation. To plan is more than just preparation. It is to conceive of a desired outcome. To define the shape of one's future. When a plan is fully realized, there is no one and nothing that can stand in your way. This is my boss's car. That's sweet. - This is my boss's wife's car. - Oh, my God. Yeah, that's hell a tight, too. This is my boss's cousin's car. Oh... Oh, my Go... Bro, I'm getting extremely hard right now. And that's how we all got to know each other. So, Tina, she had this thing for Gabe. Really good-looking guy, hot musician, long hair. The problem with Gabe, though, is that he was busy with literally every other girl on campus. Didn't even know Tina existed. So, Gabe and my brother are best friends. Well, actually, they're cousins, but that doesn't matter. My brother ends up falling for Tina. The problem with Tina, though, that I knew... my brother had to find out the hard way... Is that Tina is super high-mai. - High-mai? - High-maintenance. Okay. So tell me what you think about this. ...are not sure how the dog got in there. Police are still looking for a suspect in the murder of an Orlando woman late last Thursday night. Twenty-two-year-old Emily June was fatally stabbed outside of the Winter Park restaurant where she worked as a waitress. Police have yet to determine a motive. Stock prices fell for the second week in a row as news of a labor shortage... In one mile, merge onto I-4 East. You have arrived at your destination. Please look out for Neil. Come on, Neil. Where are you? Are you Neil? That's right. - You're Neil? - Yes, I am. That's not you. If we could get moving, there's somewhere I have to be and I'd like to be there soon. I'm here to pick up this guy. No, that's Neil. And you're here to pick me up. You said you were Neil. I know. Look, Neil's my friend. Neil called this ride for me. So, if we could go? Please. I think I should talk to Neil. Oh no, you don't need to. I should call him real quick. You don't need to call him. I'm sure he messaged you already. Did he you message you? Yo, it's Neil. You know what to do when you hear the bee... Okay, look, there's no one else on the street. If the ride's not for me, then who's it for? So, if we could just get moving? You'll hear from Neil, I'm sure, sooner or later. Thank you, by the way. - For what? - Oh, for deciding to take me. I understand you have rules to follow. I'm not trying to cause trouble. It's not a problem. It's just that I have a feeling this will be a long night. And I'd rather things went smoothly. - Why do you say that? - What? Why do you say it's going to be a long night? Anyways, I... it's nothing personal. I just didn't want to have to kick out another passenger. You kicked someone out before? One guy. He kept hitting on me. So, I told him to get out. - Where'd you leave him? - I don't know. Wherever. But he called the company and I got in trouble. I really can't afford to lose this job, so... Well, you have nothing to fear from me. So, where are we heading? - You gonna hit the clubs? - Nah. I'm more of a classical music guy. Those songs drive me crazy. Not much else to do this time of night. Oh, depends on what you're looking for. I mean, it's none of my business, but... just curious. When it gets this late, it seems like everyone is either heading home from the bar or heading out to the bar. Either that, or I'm taking a stoner to Taco Bell and they don't even know what time it is. Sounds troublesome. In one mile turn right... Yeah. But it's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Let me ask you something. What's been the worst night of your life? What do you mean? I hope it wasn't because of a passenger. No. It's never gotten that bad. Do you enjoy it? - What? Being a driver? - Yeah. Do you enjoy your job? This isn't really my job. I just do it to make money. Yeah. That's a fine distinction. I mean, uh, I'm really an architect. That's what I actually do. I've just had some... setbacks. Let me guess. A catastrophic structural failure? Hmm, no. More like catastrophic personal failure. The problem is there's only so many firms in the city and everyone seems to know each other. - So, if you screw up... - In 500 feet, turn right. ...It kind of follows you. But I'll... You know, I can get back in. I'm sure. So, what do you do? Oh. Um... I work nights, like you. - Oh, okay. - Turn right. I like the city at night. - Yeah, not much traffic. - Yeah, exactly. In one mile, merge onto Highway 50 West. The streets start to empty out I think around 2:00 a.m. That's the best time. There's so few people out. I feel like I have the city to myself, you know? You can make great time. Yeah, there are times where you can go blocks without seeing a single person. I always like it when that happens. I like to pretend that I'm all alone. You can imagine the whole world is just... quiet. - And empty. - That's, uh... peaceful. It sounds peaceful. Hey. Yeah, I am. Do you have what I want? Yeah, I have it. It'll be inside a black bag. Don't ask me where I got it. It's really better if you don't know. No. I'll be coming alone. I have a ride. No, she is, but she'll be gone by the time I get there. You'll never even see her. I wouldn't worry about it. So, was that your friend? - Who? - Neil. Oh, um, no. Yeah, I hate to bring this up, but do you think it'd be possible to pull over? What do you mean? I'm sorry, but, uh, I think there's a rest stop up ahead. If we could just stop for a moment. - You got to go? - Sorry. You know, it really won't take long to get to your destination. No, no, I know but I just... Honestly, we're almost there. I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist. - Okay. It's your time. - Thank you. Uh, it's right up here. It'll just be a minute. There's a vending machine out here, too, if you like. - Thanks. I'm good. - Are you sure? I think I'll just stay here. Okay. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. What's wrong? - You startled me. - I'm not that scary, am I? Sorry for taking so long. Hey. I brought you something. Help yourself. I already opened it for you. Cool. Thanks. Don't you like cola? I think I'll save it for later. When I need the caffeine. Huh. Of course. If you're here to rob the place, you're too late. We've already made our cash draw for the day. Not here to rob you. What can I do for you, officer? Looking for a pair of earrings. Something for the little lady? I'm guessing that's not your girl. Emily Jane. A week ago, she was stabbed eight times in the parking lot of a restaurant downtown. Oh, shit. What's it got to do with me? This picture was taken earlier that day. You see these earrings? She didn't have them when she arrived at the hospital. We're guessing whoever stabbed her still has them. You want to know if someone try to unload them here? Nice pair. Earrings, I mean. But no, I haven't seen them. Well, if anything comes in... call me. So, what, you're gonna hit every pawn shop in town? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You seem a little stressed out. Maybe we should just listen to some music. Excuse me. Can we turn the music off, please? - What was that? - I said, I prefer to have the music off, please. You don't like it? No. In fact, I... I really can't stand it. So, I'm going to have to insist. Sorry about that. Might have had it a little loud. It's not your fault. I just can't stand amelodic rhythms. It's probably something neurological. They nauseate me. And I'm... I'm not speaking figuratively. I... I feel an actual physical sense of nausea when I hear certain songs. It's almost like a... feeling of vertigo. Louder and more dissonant the song is, the worse it gets. Have you ever heard of "The Rite of Spring"? No. Igor Stravinsky in the early 1900s composed a piece of music so intense and disturbing that, uh, supposedly people in the audience began to riot. The first people to hear it were, uh, almost driven mad. I haven't heard of it. It's actually become popular over the years. But, you know, that tends to happen. People begin to tolerate a certain degree of madness. - Do you smell that? - What? Something's burning. I smell smoke. Yeah, you're right. I'm going to pull over for a second. I'm going to take a look. This will only take a second. Hey, it's me. I just feel like something really bad is going to happen. - Everything all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. The engine just overheats sometimes. Oh, well, I'm sure it's had a chance to cool off by now. We should probably get going. Right. Who were you on the phone with? The phone? Were you calling for help? You know, with the engine? - I wasn't calling anybody. - I heard you talking. Neil. Your friend. He finally called me back. Neil? Neil called you back? Well, then, I told you. You have nothing to worry about. Sorry for the delay. Yeah, it's fine. As long as we get going now. You know, you should probably have someone take a look at that. Your engine, I mean. - If it keeps overheating. - I know. I've been meaning to. You know, it puts real wear and tear on your car driving it like this. And it's not like the app covers any of the costs. I suppose that's an extra expense, but for someone in your line of work, it's a necessity. Your car's your livelihood, after all. Five years of college, two years of interning, an apprenticeship and my car is my livelihood. In one mile, turn left at Fox Hunt Drive. You know, I hadn't noticed it before, but, um, that's a very nice bracelet you have on. Oh. Thanks. Can I ask you where you got it? It was a gift from an old boyfriend, actually. He gave it to me the first weekend we went out of town. We weren't able to see each other much because of work and... other stuff, so it was a really important trip. We went to Ybor City and stayed in this beautiful old hotel. And at night, we had the most amazing dinner. Finger steak with white truffle pasta. After afterward, we went for a walk on the beach. Just us and the waves. And then he stopped and pulled the bracelet out of his coat. It had been there all night. And as he slipped it on my wrist, he said, "I want you to know something. "No matter what happens. I will always love you." Hey! Recalculating. Recalculating. Recalcul... Did you see that? I think you ran a red light. But did you see it? Do you think it was a dog? Yes. Now, let's go. Wait. You shouldn't do that. Wait by the car. Lady... Lady... Ladybug. He's dead. Oh... Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my... Sorry, Raymond. 911, what's your emergency? I need to report an accident. We're on Fox Hunt at Land Craft Avenue. Hey. It's awful. He's just laying there. - What? - I wouldn't do that. - Call the cops? I have to. - We should go. We can't. There's a dead body in the street. I have to explain what happened. I mean, I could lose my license. I could go to jail. I... I'll lose everything. Yes. But what do we say? Uh, you talk to them. Tell them it was an accident. If you vouch for me, If... If I have someone on my side... - No. No. - What? I will not speak to the police under any circumstances. But what will I do? If you call the police, they'll arrest you for manslaughter. Intentional or not, that's a crime you committed. And you'll lose everything, just like you said. No. - What's your name? - Alison. - What's your last name? - Meyers. Alison Meyers, do you want my help? Will you follow the instructions exactly and do everything I say, just as I describe it? - Yes. - Are you sure? - I have somewhere to be. - Wait! Help me. Hold on. He's missing a shoe. - We can't just... - Alison. There's a body in your trunk. We need to go. Dispatch to Detective Hartford. Respond to Fox Hunt and Land Croft for a possible signal four. 911 call was disconnected. 10-4, dispatch. Is there not a patrol car available? I'm trying to run down leads on a case. Negative, Detective Hartford. Respond to Fox Hunt and Land Croft. Responding to Fox Hunt and Land Croft. 23-59. Why are we taking it... Him with us? If we left him there, there would be a murder to investigate. And they'd come looking for you. But it's almost impossible to prosecute someone when there isn't a body. It'll be like he... He just vanished. Where are we going? First, we're going to my destination. Once we're done there, I'll take you where you need to go. And where is that? Someplace you can put a dead body where no one will find it. Take a right up here. Have you done this before? Have I done what before? You know. This sort of stuff. - Hit and runs? - Moving bodies. Just before the accident, you tried to take something from me. I had to grab your arm to stop you. I know. What were you going to do with that gun? What did you think I was gonna do? I don't know. I was... scared. Scared of what? I looked in your bag. When we pulled over at the rest stop, I looked inside. You shouldn't have done that. What is all that stuff? Jewelry and gold watches. I saw you take the ring off that guy's finger. He doesn't need it. Is that how you got all that stuff? - What do you mean? - You stole it? You stole each piece off of somebody. Yes. I saw blood. On a watch. Did you... What happened to those people? You said that if I helped you, you'd follow my instructions, that you'd do as I say. - Yes. - Be quiet. I understand you'd rather not be here. But I won't be long. I'd like to get this over with quickly. What do you want me to do? Absolutely nothing. Hello? Hello? Yeah, sure. We're still down. - Excuse me. - I'll call you back. Hey, pretty woman. You here to buy or you here to party? I'm looking for someone. Party's in the living room. I think Low Boy's in the back are doing some transactional shit. I gotta hit the head. Hopefully you'll stick around. Do I know you? - Neil? - Alison! I booked a ride. What took so long? My fault. Sorry. - Car trouble. - Check it out. I got my girl Bridget here. And over there on the couch is Bowser, tripping off the VR. You want to try it out? Take a hit at. Strap on the VR and zhoom! Down the tunnel to a whole another universe. Man, it's wild, for real. I'm sure it's great, but I'm looking for your friend. Oh, yeah. I think he's in the back with Low Boy. Hey, look out for Kathy. Who the fuck are you? Um, I'm Alison. I drive a Backseat. I'm here to pick someone up. Do you usually come inside when you pick them up with your car? Well, you see, I dropped him off here, and now I have to take him somewhere else, so, uh... Alison, right? Let me show you something. Come on. This way. Come on. If you don't mind, I think I'm gonna go back and wait in the car. Ladies first. So, you're one of them ride share drivers, yeah? How do you like it? Being a driver, I mean. You meet some interesting people. Have a seat. Let's set the mood. Well, you're a good girl, right? I mean, you're not gonna cause no problems to nobody. I'm sorry for going in your bedroom. I promise, I was just looking for my friend. Well, I know one thing. Ain't nobody what they say they are. I mean, take that Cosby cocksucker. Everybody thinking he harmless and shit, making jokes about his sweater and pudding pops. Meanwhile, that motherfucker gone through more roofies than a UCF frat house. On the other hand, take me. Maybe you think I'm some kind of dope dealer, a pusher, a kingpin. Well, now, see, that ain't me. What I am is I'm a... I'm a healer, a medicine man. You know, I... I'm bringing the community together. You know? No thanks. What I want to know is what are you all about, little Miss Driver? See, I got a girl down at courthouse says the cops are trying to work up a case against me. Get someone on the inside. Reconnaissance. A couple days later, I catch you snooping around my boudoir. Real Scooby Doo-like. What am I supposed to think? You think I'm police? I don't know what the fuck you are. And that is the fucking problem. That is Kathy. And Kathy does my shit. And Kathy makes problems disappear, like unwanted guests. Low Boy! What's going on in there? Who sent you? Was it Andrino? Open up right now or I'm taking my shit across town... You try that, you see what you get from that cheap ass motherfucker. Look at me. I swear I'm not police. You know, that is exactly what a cop would say. - I couldn't be a cop. - Really? And why is that? Because... because... Go get her, Kathy. Because there's a dead body in my trunk. What? And why would a good goody girl like you have something like that in her trunk? I'm the one who killed him. Psycho chicks are the best. I'm going to go wait inside. Yeah. Well, I... I was gonna say you could do that. Yeah. So you met Kathy? Kathy, the crocodile. I thought she was an alligator. She got teeth and she live in a swamp. What the fuck difference does it make? I did a report on alligators in middle school, respect. So who's this guy you've brought? Oh, guys. Guys, I see it. I don't know. I've just met him tonight. You don't know him? No. But if Neil says he's cool, then he's cool. Hey, Neil. Your boy is cool, right? Nah. He's an asshole. So you can just ditch this guy, right? I mean, if you want to get out of here, just say the word. I know a few places where we can go. Yeah. I don't think so. Hey, hold on man. Three caps? Yeah, I need at least four. It took me months to get all this. I hear you, man, but that is business. Tell you what. Three caps and you can have a hit of whatever you like on my table over there. Thanks. I'll just stick with the pills. I suppose you're ready to go. Do you think? Well, let's go. I still got to get out to the Oaks. You mean Lake Oakley? What's out there? Oh, shit. Oh my god. Move the table. Move the table. What's she taking? What's she on? Uh, she took some E... Uh, she took some E - and she did a bump. - Give me her purse. She's epileptic and you gave her coke? I don't know. What are you saying? What the... What does that even mean? Low Boy, open my bag. I need a bottle. Oh, my God. Is she gonna die? Yes. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh. I thought you said she was going to die. She was. Let's go. What happened? What the hell was that? They're an interesting crowd. I mean, what was that with the girl? What did you put in her mouth? Hey, hey, wait, man. Here. Bonus. You earned that. Got one less dead chick at my house because you. Thanks. But you. Sweetheart, you better get that car washed before someone think you really did kill someone. Uh-huh. Salutations, motherfuckers. Shit. Captain? Yeah. Dispatch said you needed something. Yes, sir. I put a call in for a team of crime scene techs. Yeah, well, what do you got? Potential hit and run. I got a long streak of blood running down the middle of the road here. Looks like the victim made it to the side of the road. Well, what's the condition of the victim? Well, the victim isn't here. Okay. So you found blood in the street? Yes, sir. You know, Hartford, people hit animals all the time. A dead dog does not warrant a police investigation. Well, there's an awful lot of blood here, sir. Well, maybe it was a great frickin Dane. Now, look, I know you're trying to make your bones here, okay? But this is not the way you do it. You find a body in the street, call that in. You find blood in the street, it's a job for sanitation. Yes. Sorry, sir. Understood. So what's with the gun anyway? I don't really trust those guys. I can't sleep. I haven't slept in days. I've been working 24-hour shifts, trying to keep busy but... I live the days in a trance. I've tried a lot of stuff, but the only thing that works for it is Diazepam. My insurance won't cover it but I need it so... That's what the pills are. Diazepam? Yeah. Valium? It can also treat a seizure in an emergency. So I guess I was lucky. And what are those? Rescue tools. I use them to cut people out of seat belt. Can also cut through clothing, trim bandages. They got a lot of uses. You're an EMT. I'm a paramedic. So what you were saying before, all the jewelry and stuff. Did you really take those off of dead bodies? Sometimes they're dead when we get there. Sometimes it's on the way to the hospital. I mean, most calls we get here are just minor stuff. A bar fight. Most times we just patch them up but not always. What happens? Well, it could be anything. Last call we got was for this girl, probably in her twenties, early thirties. Working a late shift at a restaurant downtown. Somebody accosted her right in the parking lot. Never found out who or why. Guy was gone when we get there. But, uh, she's been stabbed, eight times. Anterior puncture of the right lung. Her ventricular had already been perforated. And we can't stop the bleeding. And I'm with her when she dies. And I'm usually the one who's there. Was she the one with the watch? The one I found with the blood on it? She had a watch, necklace, pair of earrings. Yeah. I removed them all before we got to the hospital. Do you ever regret it? When you take that stuff. Should I? Well, most people when they see someone die, they get upset. Makes them sad, you know? Unless you're a psychopath. If I got upset every time I saw someone die I wouldn't be able to do my job. I found that out pretty quick. So it used to bother you? I suppose. Yeah. It did. Back when I started. And then what happened? Uh, I learned how to do the job. You just got to step outside of yourself for a little while. You just kind of switch the flip the part of yourself you to turn off to do this kind of work. When you're back home, when you're off duty, you can cry if you have to. You can grieve. One day I got to work and flip that switch and I just left it off. It seemed to make things easier. So. Are you going to live the rest of your life that way? Yeah, I don't know what that makes me. Maybe I am a psychopath. No. A psychopath is someone who pretends to feel things even when they don't. You're talking about someone who pretends not to feel things, even when they do. Did you ever think that that might be the reason? The reason for what? The reason you can't sleep at night. And 20 on pump five, please. Your total's 43.72. It's a chip. You've got to use the chip reader. Thanks. Hey, lady. You forgot something. Oh, thanks. So, what are you doing with all this stuff? Bleach and garbage bags. Cleaning. Do you hear that? It's my phone. Are you going to answer it? Hey, can you come here for a minute? Sure. Um... How do you get to Highway 50 from here? Well, if you're headed east, you just follow the road that way a few more blocks until you hit the second light. Hey, are you all right? I'm fine. Looks like I missed it. Well, okay, then. Thanks. That was a mistake. I should have never let anyone get that close to the car. Sort of makes you wonder, though, you know. Who's calling this person? Not really. Honestly, I don't want to think about it. Well, it's not a good sign, though. What do you mean? Well, they're getting calls at this time of night. Someone's trying to get in touch with them. And that means someone's already looking for him. So what are we going to do? Look, just tell me where we're going. What's the spot you're talking about? Have you ever heard of Lake Oakley? Yeah. It's out in the boonies, right? Isn't there a camp out there? Uh, no. Well, no. Yeah, there used to be. A couple of years ago visitors started getting sick. A kid died. The lake was... was contaminated with algal blooms. Now the resort's shut down and the whole lake is covered in this layer of toxic algae. So if you get inside there and you sink something in that water, it'll be years before anybody finds it, if ever. Sink it? How do you sink it? Tie it to something heavy, like some bricks. What about concrete blocks? Good evening. Looking into a possible hit and run. I'm wondering if anyone has used your car wash. I'm going to stop you right there. Do you remember anything about them? The girl came in and bought some stuff. What kind of stuff? Garbage bags and bleach. Maybe 20 minutes ago. Did they say where they were headed? You know that guy right there was actually asking me how to get to the highway from here. Isn't there some kind of a reward? Here we go. They got them. That was lucky. Not really. These are leftover ones from the basement. The foreman uses them to make little workbenches. You've been here before? Every day. I designed this whole building back when I still had my job. Now all I can do is sit in the car, eating a sandwich while I watch the rest of them do the work without me. If they're still using your designs why would they fire you? Like I said, personal failings. I was dating my boss. Oh, I see. And you got caught? No. He broke up with me. He was married. I don't know how I thought things would go. I guess I was fooling myself. I told him I thought he was making the wrong choice, but he made it very clear that he was done with me. Just to make sure I didn't cause him any more trouble, he reported me to HR and got me fired. Oh. So that's what happened to my career. The thing I always wanted to do. Well, not just do, not just a job. I wanted to be an architect since I was a little girl. And now I drive strangers around in my car every night just to make rent. And I spend every day trying to find someone else who will hire me. It's not like I could get a reference from my old boss. So I've kind of been left out in the cold. At least now you can get your revenge. What do you mean? Stealing their cinderblocks. These have got to be worth at least a dollar a piece. Good point. That'll teach them. Can I ask you something? What? Why did you decide to help me? You needed help. Well, thank you. Mike. What? Mike. That's my name. Thank you, Mike. Mike. What's wrong? Oh. Nothing. Can I see the guy's phone? What do you need that for? Just thinking that we need to be thorough. Every trace of this guy needs to disappear or this will all come back to you. You should probably pull the battery out, just in case. They probably can track that stuff now. I'm not sure that's how it works. Well, just to be on the safe side, we should destroy the phone, not just sink it. Maybe you can break it in half. The person that called when we were at the gas station. It says her name was Michelle. What did you say? Detective Hartford, please come in. The vehicle was due back at the station an hour... Huh. What? Oh, it's just something this guy said before he died. He said, "Ladybug." He did? Yeah. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but it's a person, in his call history. That's why he mentioned her. That was the last person he spoke to. I mean, look at the time stamp. When was the accident? I don't remember. Well, it was around midnight. He got a call from this woman minutes before he died. How do you know it's a woman? Ladybug. Who do you think it is? Shit. What do I do? You have to pull over. It's probably nothing, like a busted tail light. They'll give you a ticket, and that'll be that. Is everything all right? Can you step out of the car, ma'am? Come with me. What's going on? I came across the scene of a possible hit and run earlier this evening. Oh, my God. There was a lot of blood at the scene, but no body. Do you know anything about that? Oh, I'm not sure what you mean. Did you take your car through a car wash early this evening? Um, I may have. Any particular reason for that. The car was dirty. I've been meaning to clean it. I'm going to take a look. This will only take a second. Hello. Hi. It's me. You all right? What's going on? I'm okay, I think. I mean, I picked this guy up for a ride, and... I don't know. There's something creepy about him. I'm sorry. I didn't want to call you, but I just didn't know what to do. Do you need any help? Can you meet me outside? I'm right down the street from the office. Yeah, of course. Give me a minute. I'll be right down. I'm sorry. I just don't know what to do. I feel like something really bad is going to happen. If I look in the trunk of that car, what am I going to find? Nothing. Just old clothes and things I was planning to give away. Okay. I'm gonna ask you to open the trunk. Okay. Can you take a step back now? That was close. No. It's good, man. You need a receipt? You're serious? Get the fuck out of here. Your product in the bag over there. You can use the bag for transportational purposes or whatever, but I will need it back, and my kids. Yeah. Sure of thing. Hey, Captain. Yeah. It's done. I'm headed back to the station. There's something I want to check out first. Let me ask you, what's the best way to head out to Lake Oakley? A... Alison. Hey, Mike. I just want to say I appreciate you sticking with me through all this. This whole thing has not been easy for me. But you have kept a level head. You have kept me calm and focused when everything else was crazy. If you weren't here, I don't know what I'd do. So thank you. Alison? Yeah. Who is that man in the trunk? He knew you. He's the one I told you about. Who? When I worked at Miller & Westhoff, he was my boss. You are Ladybug. The one that called him. Right before the accident. Did you know that he would be on that street corner? But it was all an accident. You... you were hysterical. Was I? Yeah, of course. I needed an alibi. You were supposed to come to my rescue. Maybe I went a little overboard. But believe me, I've cried enough real tears for Ray already. I just needed someone to speak to the police. I didn't expect you to volunteer as an accomplice. It doesn't matter. When we get to the lake, we can get rid of him. Thanks to you. And then we'll be done with all of this. Right. I'm going to start scrubbing the blood out of the trunk. You got this? Sure. Are you worn out? You must be tired. You had a lot of work. I hardly ever come out here. You'd think it would be quiet at night but listen, frogs, crickets. It's kind of nice just to listen to. You're all right? I'll be fine. Do you want to go home? Yeah. If you want, I can put on some music. But you don't like pop music, right? You're more of a classical guy? Uh, I don't know. It doesn't matter. I bet I know what you're looking forward to. What? When you get home, you're looking forward to getting some sleep. I don't blame you. We've been driving all night. I'm exhausted. I can't wait to get home and forget all about this. So what are you going to do? What do you mean? There's two bodies. You left that cop back there. What are you going to do about that? I don't know. Do you think I need to do something? You shot him. Well, yeah, but... well, that wasn't my gun. That was the gun from your bag. I pulled it out back at the gas station. Did you buy that gun yourself or did you borrow it from someone? Uh, yeah, I... I bought it. So it's registered to you then. Well, if you're on record as the owner, then I don't really have anything to worry about, now, do I? You all right, Mike? See. I told you you'd be sleepy. Where are they? Where are they? I had four bottles in here. Yeah, you probably don't need them, but just in case, I crushed a couple up for you. If you've been drinking that soda, you're probably starting to feel it. And don't worry about any loose ends. No one will know what happened. I'll make sure of it. Mike, relax. Where are you? Gordie Wilson, Orlando PD. She says, this guy a called a ride then forced her to drive around the city trading stolen merchandise for drugs. I came across these two at Low Boy's and I knew something was up. They were headed out to Lake Oakley when an officer pulled them over. She says he shot him right in front of her. Christ. Well, it sounds like she's had a hell of a night. Miss, are you all right? I think so. It's all over now. You're safe. Thanks. To plan is more than just preparation. It is to conceive of a desired outcome to define the shape of one's future. When a plan is fully realized, there is no one and nothing that can stand in your way.
