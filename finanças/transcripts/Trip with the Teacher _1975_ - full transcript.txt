No, I just got to yank this wheel And take it to a station. Hey, wait a second. I might be able To save you some hassle. Hey, you know, when you got a bike As old as mine is, You got to be well prepared. Got a hand pump right here. A hot patch kit. I think we can probably just pull a tube Out through that tire there. Then you can pump enough air into it with this. Get you to the nearest station. You're all right. Name's Jay. What's yours? Pete. This my brother Al. Howdy. Yeah, I just came out of L.A. this morning. Got 10 days off work. Boy, it's really nice country around here, huh? Yeah. Nice riding through these parts. Yeah. Are there any Indians still living there? Why, of course. Wow. Then we'll get to see them, won't we? We sure will. Won't that be interesting? Yeah. That's good enough. I can ride it like it is. Great. All right. Let me just put this stuff away. Ok, Al. We're back in the race. Al. Hey, listen, why don't I ride along With you, huh? Just to make sure It stays around? Oh, that's great. Ohh. What's he still doing here? He's gonna ride along. He's all right. How long we gonna be there, miss tenny? Only 2 days, Tina. We can see most of it in that time. Then we'll drive to the grand canyon, Get some pack horses, and get Right down into the canyon itself. Oh, we'll have a great time. It's gonna be such fun. You're gonna really love it, girls. We'll sleep out in our sleeping bags And cook all our meals out in the open. It's gonna be just absolutely beautiful. Now, listen to this... "Navajo Indians in the..." This'll be our last comfort stop, girls. What'll it be, mister? Fill her up and check the oil. Nice. Yeah, real nice. Come on. Come on. I'll get you something to drink. Have you been driving long? Uh-huh. Ohh. Where you coming from? Back there. Where you going? That a way. Yeah. Well, it's been nice talking to you. Yeah. 650 vigor, huh? Oh, yeah. Fun, aren't they? Oh, yeah. They're a lot of fun. Say... Sounds like you just might know a little bit about bikes. So-so. Julie here, she's the good one. She rides as well as some of the boys do. Well, how about that? How about what? Oh, nothing. I just thought it was great That you like bikes. I hate them. You hate them? She just said that you could ride real good. You don't have to like a thing to do it well. Anyone can ride a motorcycle. Even you. Uh, yeah, well, I mean, I just... You know, what she said. Well, I mean, I just. That's the trouble with you guys That ride motorcycles. All you can talk about is bikes. Well, I don't like them. Besides, they're noisy and dangerous. Yeah. Well, I mean, gee, I'm sorry. I didn't... you know, I didn't mean to... Is that all you can say, I'm sorry? You better get back to the bus, girls. We're gonna be shuffling off In just a minute. Ok. See ya. Wow. That Julie's really a pretty girl. They all are. Hey! How about a little service out here? Ok, ok. What'll it be? I wanna fill them up. Oh. Sure will. What do you do around here when you get a little horny? Don't you get a little horny, pop? Hey, come on, come on. That bus has put a lot of distance between them and us. We'll be on the road as soon as speedy here Gets us all filled up. Well, you're sure in a big hurry For a bunch of guys That's just bumming around. Must get awful bored out here with this dumb job. Only when loud-mothed jerks like you come in. Watch your mouth, old man, Before I put my foot in it. Boy, are you ever ferocious. Oh, sorry about that. Well, maybe it'll help clean your crummy bike off. Wipe it off. Here's a rag. Wipe it off yourself. That'll be $4.12 for the lot of you. Candy? Got some. It's inside. Pete? Come here. I'll take care of it. He's just an old man. It's all right. Get your bike fired up. I'll get you some candy. I'll take $4.12. Out of 5. 4.15... 4.25, 75 is 5.00. Want any candy? No. I don't want no candy. Hey, pop? Huh? Forgot my blue chips. Oh. Yeah. There you go. Marvin? Yes, ma'am? How far are we to the first campsite? Oh, about another 50 Miles, I reckon, But don't you worry none. I'll have you there before long. What seems to be the problem, Marvin? I can't say right off, But something's wrong somewhere. Obviously, but it isn't anything Serious, is it? Can't be the gas. We ain't come that far, And I just put new spark plugs in it. Danged if I know. Now what? Soembody's bound to come along pretty soon. I'll just flag him down and get some help. In this part of the country? This time of year? Traffic is kind of scarce this time of year. But you wanted to rough it anyway. Now's as good a time as any to start. Besides, this ain't a bad place for camping. That's a very astute observation, Marvin. Thank you. Think nothing of it, ma'am. Glad to help. It's awful hot on the bus, miss tenny. Is it all right if we just walk around? Sure it is. Of course. It's ok. Is it gonna take very long? No. Marvin will have it fixed In just a little bit. Won't you, Marvin? Yes, ma'am. Well, gang, here we are. Right smack dab in the middle of nowhere. At least a whole day's walk To the nearest boy. If that's all you think of, Bobbie, Then why did you come on this trip? My mother insisted. Hey, listen, miss purity, Don't tell me you never think about boys. Don't be absurd, Bobbie. Of course I do. Then you know there is a difference Between the boys and the girls. Just what are you getting at, Bobbie? The truth. Just tell it like it is truth. Nothing wrong with that. My, my. Sounds like regular group therapy. Oh, not at all. At least I'm honest about what I do. You're hopeless, Bobbie. Absolutely hopeless. I think there's another word for it. What do you mean? Well, if I have to explain it, It wouldn't be worthwhile. Come on. We've all had it... And loved it. Not all, Bobbie. Regardless of how square, How natural, how hip or critical, Not all of us have had it. Do you mean to tell me That we actually have a virgin among us? There are probably more Than you'd care to know about. You see, some of us were raised By parents who stressed the teachings Of the Bible. Please. I can't take it. Would you get off that crap? Either you like it or you don't. It was meant to be used, not to just sit on. That's all very understandable If you're talking about dogs. Are you calling me... A bitch? That's right. You're just a horny little bitch. Miss tenny! Bobbie! Stop it, girls! Cut it out! Cut it out! Stop it! Cut it out! Come on! No! Hi there. Howdy. You guys just stop to get a little exercise? No. Just a little misunderstanding. Actually, we didn't mean to stop at all, But the bus sort of chug-a-chugged And up and quit on me. Looks like you're going to be here for a while. Yeah, that's too bad. Yeah. Lucky for us you guys happened to come along. I can't find the trouble with this thing. Hey, maybe one of you guys could have a look at it, huh? What do you think? I don't know nothing about busses. Oh, come on. You can just take a look at it for him. Ok. For you, I'll take a look. So you'll fix chug-a-chug, huh? Hey, you reckon he can fix it? I don't know nothing about busses. Hey, you guys have a good time. I'll go over there and talk to the ladies. Hey, sport, you got any tools? Yeah, just a minute. I'll get them for you. Turn on the ignition, too. Ok. Come here. You. You. Come here. I want to talk to you. What are you fighting about? What are you fighting about, hmm? What are you guys doing Out here in the middle of the desert? I hope you like the sites you're seeing. I've seen some works. Ain't we all. You're a pretty smart little cookie, ain't you? I've been around some. I bet you have. Hey, you really had me going back there. You know, I didn't know what to say. You did look kinda funny. I got one look at Pam trying To keep from laughing And I just couldn't hold it anymore. Yeah. I guess I must have looked sort of silly, huh? I'm sorry. It was mean of me to tease you like that. Oh, no. No problem, no problem. See, you really are nice. Most guys would have gotten angry. Oh, no. I mean, what the heck? You were just having a little fun. But it was at your expense. Anyway, I'm glad you understand. Hey, where you from? We're all out of Los Angeles. Oh. So some sort of school group or something? No. We're just friends. Oh. Uh... Well, what are you doing out here? Our folks decided to pitch in And send us on a camping trip. They probably just wanted To get us out of their hair for a while. Where are you gonna go? Oh, just a little tour of the deserts. You know, ghost towns, Indian ruins, Junk like that. Well, how long are you gonna be here? Hey, wait a minute. You're asking all the questions. How about answering a few for me? Oh, yeah, sure, sure. Shoot. Well, first off, what's your name? Jay. Jay what? Jay Andrews. Jay Andrews. Jay Andrews. That's a nice name. How about your friends? Oh, that's Al over there, And that's Pete over there working on the bus. Have you been friends long? No, I just met them down on the highway. Pete was having some trouble with his bike, So I stopped to give him a hand. Hey, you know, you're really pretty. Well, thank you, Jay, But I'm really a mess riding in the bus In all this heat and... Oh, you'd never know it. You're really pretty. Well, I, uh... Well, I, uh... How do you like that? A taste of your own medicine, huh? Uh-huh. Well... You either have a clogged gas line Or you blew the fuel pump. A fuel pump? Oh, man. That's all we need. Now, what do I do? Well, don't ask me. I just told you what was wrong with it, sport. What you do from here is all up to you. I mean, could you at least make a phone call When you get back to the next town And send some help out to us? It's all right with me, If it's all right with Al. Which one's Al? That one. Oh. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. You're Al, aren't you? That guy working on the bus Said I should talk to you regarding favors. Did he say that? Well, it seems as if... The fuel pump is broken And Marvin doesn't have the tools To get it working again. So what? Well, I was wondering if you'd be kind enough To make a phone call When you get back to the next town And send us some help. I don't think so. I like it right here. Are you just gonna let us sit here Until you make up your mind? No. You see, what I was thinking about doing Is I was thinking about taking this girl And putting her on the back of my bike And going out in the desert with her. Barbara, you'll do no such thing. Ok. But if she gets on my bike, We might just ride into the next town And send back some help. Otherwise, we're just gonna ride off In the other direction. And you're gonna be stuck out here all by yourself. Don't try to intimidate me like that. I don't have to stand here and listen to you. I think it's time for you and your friends to leave. We'll manage without you. We'll just have to wait Until someone else comes along That's willing to help us. Don't be a prude, miss tenny. I'll go with him. I don't mind. Looks like that's the only way We're going to get out of here. Whether I'm a prude or not is irrelevant. Now, what you plan on doing with your life Is your concern But not while I'm responsible for you. Come on. Let's go. Hey! You let her stay here. This is none of your business. The well being of these girls Is exactly my business. What's the hassle? There wouldn't be any hassle If you and your friend Would just go on your way and leave us alone. We'll manage somehow without you. Let's go. You're not gonna get very far With a busted fuel pump. I happen to be responsible For these girls. And I'm not letting any one of them Go off with this ill-mannered... Uhh! Rude! Uhh! What do you think, Al? You think we ought to give them a break? I don't know. Well, you want to stay here? You want to stay? Well, you know I want to stay. Then we'll stay. Do you think there's any chance of fixing it? Yeah, there's a chance If we had some decent tools. Hey, why don't we just pull The pump out and take it To the gas station? No, I don't want to do that. It's gonna take too much time. Al, remember we were out here A couple of years ago, Riding around, there was a farmer Working on that tractor? That's around here somewhere. Why don't I go out and check it out? I don't want to do it. It's going to take too much time. I want to get out of here. Hey, why don't we just go And take the girls with us? Who is this guy, man? Hey, no, look... We hook the bikes up to the bus And just tow it. You think it'll work? What do you think? Oh, I think it sounds like a real good idea. Maybe we could get ourselves some action. What do you think, Marvin? I don't know. Well, if it's all right with you, Then it's all right with me. I'll check it out. Is this it? It is as far as I'm concerned. It's deserted! Hey, what's going on? I thought you guys knew where you was going. We do, dummy. We're going on our way And you can tell the lady in the bus That we say good-bye. Hey, wait a minute. You're not going to go and leave us out here In the middle of nothing, are you? That's exactly what I'm going to do. Am I to understand that you plan to desert us In this God- forsaken place? You've been telling me To get out of here all day So that's just what I'm going to do. Well, that was before when we were back by the highway And had a chance, But now that you've brought us all the way out here I don't think it's fair that you should abandon us. Is that so? Look, we don't have much money, But I can probably give you about... I don't want your money. Well, then what do you want? You'd be surprised what a piece of ass Would do for my disposition. Marvin: Hey! Wait! Stop! Stop! Not to a lady! Come on, you big gorilla! Come on! Come on, you big dummy! Come on, dummy! You wanna fight, huh? You wanna fight, huh? Come on! Come on! Come on, huh? You wanna fight? Huh? You wanna fight? Come on! Look out, Marvin! Hey! Hey! Ahh. Ahh. He's dead. Hey, Al! You broke his neck! He's dead! He's dead? Hey, Marvin's dead. And you killed him! Shut up! You killed Marvin! Shut up! You killed Marvin! Shut up! You killed Marvin! Listen to me, man. We got a find a way out of here, Al. Come on, Al. We'll just keep on going. We'll go back to Mexico. We'll just keep on going, Al. We can just ride on back to Mexico. No! They're gonna come after us. Put us back in jail. Al, no one's going to put us in jail. It was an accident. It was no accident! We didn't mean to kill him, Al. I saw you push him in front of my bike. Dead. And we killed him. And if any of those people Get out of here and tell anybody, It's going to be our ass. It's all right, it's all right. What are you looking for? I'm looking for something to cover That guy's body with before he cooks in the sun. Oh, what a horrible thought. Yeah? Well, just be glad it wasn't you. What do you mean by that? Oh, Judy, come sit down. Don't you know what's going on? What do you mean? Look, those two guys just killed a man. Now, they've got to do something about it. Now, they've got one of two choices. They can either turn themselves in Or they can run. If they run, We tell the police. Now, if they capture them, we identify them. But if there's no "we" to tell, You understand? You mean you think he might try to kill us? Well, what else can he do? We're witnesses. But one witness is as good as a hundred. That's why one of us has got to get away. Then maybe he'll run. Oh, my God, Jay, what are we going to do? We'll do nothing. Let's just play along with them. That'll give us some time to think. It'll give him some time to think, too. God, I hope he runs. Now, listen... Don't tell anybody about this, ok? This is just between you and me, all right? Don't tell anyone. No one, ok? You got to be crazy. It's the only way. Well, I ain't going for it. Look... Nobody comes out here for months at a time. By that time, we're going to be long gone. We got to look out for one another, right? You look after me, I look after you. Besides... You don't got to do nothing But make sure they don't get away. I'll take care of the rest. We're going to have a good time. All right? All right? Al... If you weren't my brother... But I am. Look at that Al. He looks like some kind of freak. He scares me. Me, too. You'd have to be stupid Not to be scared. I want to get away from here. I wish I knew what he was thinking. Well, maybe you wouldn't like it. I don't know about the rest of you, But I'm going to give him stuff to think about. Like what? Simple. I know all of you think of me As little Bobbie hard-ass, but that's ok with me. But as long as that dude's thinking about my ass, Our chances of us getting out here are much better. How are you going to do that? Usually on my back. Bobbie. Now, listen, what I'm going to do Is for all of us. You just remember that. Bobbie, you come back here. She's a pretty loud broad, ain't she? She's just horny and won't admit it. What about you? Always, but I don't try to hide it. I don't want to do that, Not in front of everybody. Why don't you take your clothes off? I don't want to. Not with an audience. I want you to take your clothes off. I don't want to. I want you to take your clothes off! You don't want me to hurt you, do you? Take off your clothes. She looks pretty good, don't she? Take it off. Come here. Come here. Get your hands off of her! Will you shut up?! Hey, hey, hey! Get back! Oh, you want to fight with me, huh? Pretty brave. You wanna fight? Uhh! Uh! Now it's your turn. You've been a pain in my ass off all day long. What are you going to say now, huh? You got something to say? Tie him up! Clear out. Get in! Big mouth, huh?! I'm sorry. For a big mouth! Huh?!

You kinda like it! I'm good! You fight me now, I'll kill you. Ha ha ha. Can I have a sip? Come on, Tina. Come on. Come on! Come on. Want a drink? Come on. Pete: Relax. Come on. You look so nervous. Come on. It's just a drink. Come on. Come on. There you are. Come on. Don't let him get away! You son of a bitch, get him! You son of a bitch, get him! Uh! Come on, baby. Get him!

Don't let him get away! Get him! Get him! You son of a bitch! God damn it! You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Aah! Where you going? I just want to go See if miss tenny is all right. Is that ok? Go on. Sit down. Miss tenny. Miss tenny? I'm all right. Miss tenny. It's all right. There are other things more important. Look what he's done to you. Doesn't matter. The only thing that does... Did you get him? He got himself. What do you mean? He lost control, went over a cliff. He's not going to tell anybody anything. That wasn't so hard, was it? You done good. You deserve a reward. Come on. Did you hear that? Yeah. Tina, you're our last chance. You have got to get out of here and get help. Me? How? Just crawl out the window And go back across the desert the way we came. Will you come with me? I can't. I can't leave the other girls. It's all up to you, baby. You've got to do it alone. Now, when you get to the highway, Follow it back toward the gas station. Someone will find you. I'm scared. You girls made a big mistake. Your friend ain't never coming back. Take your pick. Go ahead. You take anyone you want. Then call the police And tell them where we are. I'm scared. They'll take care of you. Now, go. Quick. Before they come. Come on. Hurry. You have a good time. My legs hurt. Hey, Al. Where's the other one? Special one, huh? Go on. Go! She's in the other room. Hey, Al? She's not in here. Watch them. I'll take care of this one. Uhh! Oh. No! Please! Don't! Please, stop it! Aah! Where's Tina? Did you find her? Is she all right? I don't know. I couldn't find her. I looked all around for her. It was dark. She'll come back when she's scared. Did you miss me? Hmm? Did you miss me? Did you? Get up! Come on! Get up! Get up! Sit down. What's the matter with you, huh? Pete! I steal all these chicks for you. You don't want them? It's all right. You'll watch, ok?
