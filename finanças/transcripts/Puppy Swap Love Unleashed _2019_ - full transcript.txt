[barking] Hey, sweetie. Come on. Come on, darling. Yeah, I got good news and bad news, honey. Somebody wants to adopt you. [whining] I'm sorry, guys. I tried, I really did. But he just wants one dog, yeah. Okay? Shall we go see him? Say bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. There you go. That's a good puppy. There we go. [puppy 1] Hey! Where you taking my sister? - [woman] Okay. - [puppy 2] What about Haley? I can't leave without her. - Haley! - Lindsay! [woman] Good baby. - [puppy whining] - Good baby. Come on. [Haley] Don't worry. I'll break out of this pen and find you. I promise. What am I supposed to do now? Oh, I'm gonna be so lonely. Well, you know this, but these guys are all rescues. I think they know they've been given a second chance in life, don't you? I think so. Dogs are so much smarter than people think. In fact, in my opinion, dogs are smarter than people, period. [laughing] I have to agree. - So, the real reason why I'm here... - Yeah. ...is that it is our one-year anniversary with my boyfriend, and I wanted a special gift. Are you still going out with Mel? Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Wonderful! Wonderful, wonderful. - Well, he's always wanted a dog, so, I thought, maybe a puppy? - Right. A puppy? Oh. You know, this is your lucky day. I have exactly what you want. Come here. Look. Oh, my goodness! - [dog barking] - [laughs] It's so cute! Who is this tiny little one? So, that's Haley. - Aw. - That's Haley. She's a little sad. She lost her sister today. - Oh, no. What happened? - [whining] Oh, not what you think. Um... Her sister got adopted, but she's very lonely. And she'll grow. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Aw. Well, Haley, what do you say? If I take you home, you won't be so lonely anymore? Huh? - Oh, my goodness. - Perfect! A perfect match! [chuckles] Aw. She's so cute! - [dogs barking] - Phew. [dishes clattering] [clattering continues] Mel, are you sure you don't need my help in there? [Mel] No. No, no. I've got-- got everything under control. You just-- you stay there. - [Haley whining] Oh, let me out of this box! - Hey. Shh. [rattling] All right. Soon enough, okay? - Dinner is served, my lady. - Oh, wow. - You did all this? - Cowboys can cook too. Just takes the proper planning and preparation. - Hmm. - Nothing but the best for the best. Well, aren't you just full of surprises. [sighs] You have no idea. [chuckles] [doorbell rings] Were you-- were you expecting someone? No. Hello, sir. It's me again. I'm so sorry. I forgot to deliver the mashed potatoes. My apologies. They were still in the van. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh, by the way, sir, uh, you forgot to leave a tip. So, all that... preparation and planning. - [Mel sighs] - [laughs] I totally ruined the meat loaf. It was a disaster. - Oh. - It would make a good doorstop, but it wasn't going to be a good anniversary dinner. Hey, come on. It's okay. You know that I like takeout. Besides, it's not about the cuisine. It's about the company. - Oh, God. I love you. - [laughs] Yeah, I kinda figured that. It's me and you against the world, right? I mean, come on. The world doesn't stand a chance. [laughs] But what if it was three of us? What, you're not-- [whining] Happy anniversary! [Haley] Pleased to meet you, handsome. You got me a puppy? I did! Her name is Haley. - Oh... - [laughs] She's... um... Wait, what's wrong? I thought that you said you wanted a dog. No, and it's-- [sighs] Yes, but-- One second. [clears throat] - Just-- Stay there. - Okay. Hey, little girl. Oh, no, no, no. He just ordered that. - No, he just ordered that. - [Haley] So good. You can't do that. Come on. [chuckles] Happy anniversary. [giggling] Oh, my goodness. - You didn't! - Yeah. - That is Lindsay. [chuckles] - No. Let me guess. Aw... Animal shelter? - Delilah Higgins. - [chuckles] Yeah. Okay, okay. Oh... [Haley] I found you. I told you I would. [Lindsay] Okay, okay. Don't make a scene. [Haley] What are you talking about? I make every scene. [Lindsay] Catch me if you can! Oh, wow. Two new additions. Hopefully we didn't bite off more than we can chew. [laughs] Speaking of chew, looks like one of them just found a new chew toy. [Lindsay] This smells so good. This is mine now. Hey. Those are my favorite sweat socks. - [chuckles] - [Mel sighs] Well, let the compromises begin. Welcome to family life. [Haley] Hey, give that back! I found it first! Well, then... we should make this official. - Oh, my God. - [Mel] Jessica Reynolds? - Will you marry me? - [gasps] Is this for real? You want me to get the ring certified? - Yes, yes! - Okay, fine. I'll get the ring certified. No! No. Yes, yes, yes. I'll marry you. [grunting] [Lindsay] I'll get it. I'll get it. I'm so hungry. - Oh, no, no! - No, no, no! [Lindsay] Mmm. - [dogs barking] - [door opens] [laughing] Well, they're gonna be okay. That's the good news. Now we just have to wait until they evacuate. Poop. We have to wait for them to poop. What kind of ring was this? An engagement ring. Oh, yes! Congratulations! Did you know that I've been ordained in the universal church? That's good to know. [Delilah] Just a little reminder. I'm gonna go check on them, okay? Hey, guys! Did you poop yet? Oh, Mel. Listen. Despite this little snafu, today is the best day of my life. Worst day of my life! So, that's it, huh? You're just gonna leave? - There's nothing else to talk about. - Yeah, you know, - 'cause I thought we had something special. - Well, so did I! But if you're not willing to support my career decisions-- Moving to Los Angeles is ridiculous. Okay, you can put on makeup here. [scoffs] Working for the largest cosmetic company in the world is not just putting on makeup. You think that my career is just some sort of hobby. Your dream of having some woman cook and clean and take care of you is delusional. So, what, I'm supposed to sell my parents' ranch, huh? Give up my entire life and move with you to Los Angeles, the black hole of depravity? Tell me what you really think. [Lindsay] Hey. What's going on? This isn't fair. We are family. We're supposed to stay togethe. You know what? Fine. Go ahead. Go. See if I care. You can take back your poop ring. You want Lindsay's sweat socks? No, no. You know what? She can keep that. You know where I'll be. You know where I'll be. Goodbye, Mel. [door closes, engine starts] Goodbye, Jess. [Lindsay whining] Hey. Don't worry, Lindsay. We'll find a new home, no matter how. You'll see. Uh, Jessica, could you please come to my office? Yes, Powers. [Lindsay] Powers calls, you go running. [Lindsay barks] Um... Powers? - Do you know what time it is? - 10:34. Let me rephrase that. Can you guess what time it is? 10:34. No. It is time to celebrate. [laughs] - I'll get it. Just-- We're gonna celebrate this. Watch. - What? Argh. Ooh, it's celebration time, watch it! Whee-hee! Whoo! - [cork pops] - [Lindsay] Hey, watch it! - Uh... - Whoo-hoo-hoo! Okay. What are we celebrating? Your new scent, Xtraordinar, has just been approved to go to market. [laughs] That's amazing. Lindsay, did you hear that-- Oh! - [Lindsay] Be careful! - Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me just clean that up. Just one... Never apologize. It's a sign of weakness. And please, we pay people to do that. They clean, we celebrate. Oh. Wow, uh, so it was already approved? With flying scents. I told you, with my management prowess, you are on the road to success in no time. And no time is now time. Morphascent Cosmetics is going to send you on a nationwide publicity tour to launch Xtraordinar, the androgynous scent for men and women. [Lindsay] What's this about a tour? You know I have abandonment issues. A toast, to the most beautiful, hardworking, and soon to make me the rich-- happiest husband on planet Earth. Oh... Lipstick. Uh... I'm sorry, isn't this all just going a little bit fast? Poppycock. You've been working on this for four long years. All I did was just grease the wheels a little, make them spin faster. Leonard. I heard my name. - [Lindsay growling] - Nice doggy. Go on, go on. Get the sample. Close your eyes. [chuckles] Don't you dare open those eyes. You're going to be so excited. I can't wait to see your reaction. Ta-da! [Powers] What do you think? It's my face. [Lindsay] Whoa, that is freaky. You're coming into your own, Jess. And I have got it all worked out. You're going to go on your publicity tour to launch Xtraordinar. When you get back in a few weeks, wedding bells will be ringing. We are going to get married in a hot-air balloon, followed by a flock of doves over hundreds of people. Everyone is gonna be there. Possibly even a few people you know. Uh... Well, what about Lindsay? - Who? - Lindsay, the dog. [Lindsay] Yeah. What about me? I go everywhere with her. Oh! Oh. Well, yeah, I mean, she'll be the pup of honor. [Lindsay] You know I don't like you, right? No, no. I meant for the publicity tour. - No, no, no. - Oh. No. No dogs. - Jess, no. - We don't want dogs on a pub-- They can't smell perfume. They s-- You know. Pss... You guys know that I can't go anywhere without her. [Lindsay] Yes. Put that foot down. Just watch where you step. Well, of course you won't go anywhere without her. Or my-- Your assistant, Leonard. He will be there the whole entire time. And if there's anything you need, he will be there to fetch it for you. So to speak. I'll be there. I'll be there. Yeah. So, is everything ready? [Leonard] Oh, everything is ready, Mr. Andrews. Yeah. The tickets are purchased. The bags are packed. I hired a nice little driver. Ex-military, I think. Special Ops. And you're going to need to dust off your cowboy boots, because we are going to Montana! [Lindsay] What did he just say? I'm sorry, wait. Um, Montana? Yeah, I figured that we'd stack the deck in our favor. Hometown girl makes good. You'll be a smash. Toast of the town. - They have toast in Montana, right? - [Leonard] I think so. I'm sorry. I just haven't been back to Montana, you know, since... well, since I left. Oh, yeah. And you left a nobody and you're coming back a star. The publicity practically writes itself. In fact, Leonard, get our people on that right away. [Leonard] I'll be on it. [Powers] I love you, kid. Big things are afoot for us. Big things, for both of us! And listen. Don't forget this is a cutthroat business. It is a dog-eat-dog world out there. - No offense. [chuckles] - [Lindsay] Dog eat what? But... I want you to do me a favor. Do not listen to what anybody has to say. No one. You just do what you feel in your heart is right. Unless that person knows what's best for you. Like me. [laughs] - Lipstick. - [Leonard] Mr. Andrews. Could I talk to you about the... a little bit? The pronunciation? - Sure, yeah. - Yes. What do you think about Extraordinaire? Uh... I hate it. Wow. - [Lindsay whines] - Well... All right, Lindsay. What do you say? You and me, kiddo, on an adventure to Montana. [Lindsay] Montana, huh? How's the weather this time of year? [gasps] Will I get dry fur? [Haley] Howdy, Clark. What's the word on the street, Martin? Hey there, Julie. Good to see you. Hey, ladies. Looking good toda. [Haley barking] Hey. Quit your barking. [Haley] Just greeting the world. You should give it a try. Well, you're all excited, aren't you? Gonna go see Delilah Higgins in your dog park resort, right? [Haley] Oh, great. I can see my friends. We just got one stop to make. Gotta keep the lights on, don't we? And keep you fed. Huh? [Haley] You know getting fed is always high on my to-do lis. - Have a nice day. - Thanks. [Haley] Hey, what are you carrying there? [gasps] Is that food for me? - Hey, Sally Ann. - Hey, Mel. - Where's your father? - He takes weekends off now, but he gave me permission to pay you top dollar. Thanks. [laughs] You know, you might be overpaying me just a little bit. You're our best provider, Mel. You're worth every penny and then some. So, where's the town's most eligible bachelor off to now? - Uh, Delilah Higgins' place. - Still volunteering there? Yeah, you know, she could use the help. You know her knees and hips and back and... [laughs] It's not what it used to be. Besides, Haley loves it. [Haley] That's true. But not as much as I love food. Sometimes I think you like hanging around more with animals than you do people. You ever think about settling down with someone with two legs, rather than four? I don't know. At least with animals, you know where you stand. You're always in good standing with me, Mel. You too, Haley. [Haley sniffs] Something smells good. Got you two more bags of your favorite dog food. Oh. Would you mind putting that in my pickup truck? - Red one? - Yeah. - Of course. - Thank you. You trying to win over my dog's heart? It's a start. So, you're gonna go to the fair this weekend? Yeah, I'll be there. My beef stew's gonna win first place. [sighs] And he cooks too. - I'll see you around, Sally Ann. - Count on it. - Come on. Let's go, Haley. - [Haley] Can I ride in the back? - I wanna protect that grub. - Thanks, bud. - Now, I have your itinerary right here. - Okay. - Here you go. - [Lindsay] I'm Ms. Reynolds' consultant. - I'll look over these first. - Lindsay. Those aren't for you. - [Lindsay] My bad. - I just... [sighs] I don't know what's gotten into her. The devil, perhaps. Mutt could use a shock collar and some little cement shoes. [Lindsay] Try it, and you'll be singing soprano forever. Oh! No, Lindsay, get off. Get off, Lindsay. Stop it. - Oh... Ah. Oh. - [Lindsay growling] Lindsay, stop it. Get off of me. - Disgusting. - [sighs] You wanna check it out? [Haley] Does a dog get fleas? All right. Go on. - Hey, you're back! - Yeah. What did you say? - I said, yeah, I'm back. - No, my back's fine. About the only part of me that is fine these days, but... How are you feeling? Well, you know, it comes and it goes. Mel, this is none of my business, but I really don't think it's healthy for you to be spending all your time here. You know there is a whole world out there. There are women. There's dating. Women. Bingo. Bingo tournaments with women. There's skydiving, which you would love! Skydiving with women. There you go. I like it here. Of course I can hear you. I'm not that deaf. Not yet. But you know what I think? I'm beginning to have my memory going. Delilah, don't worry about me, okay? I'm gonna be fine. And I got my ranch. Business is great. You know, Haley... Haley's amazing. How do I put this subtly? You need a girlfriend, Mel! You know, you're the one who's hard of hearing. - Not me. - Yes, you. I've seen the way these girls look at you. At least I would, if everything wasn't so blurry. And I hear things. A little muffled, but I do hear them. What is going on with you and Sally Ann, huh? We're just friends. She's not my type. Who cares if she can type? That's a very overrated skill, especially in this day and age. The point is, she's a female. She's a human female. I get it, I get it. She's a member of the opposite sex. [laughing] She's not opposed to sex, not that one. That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. And I do hear things. Guess who's coming into town today? Who? I asked you. Who? What was I saying? Oh, gosh. Oh, I hate this. You know, I... I think my memory's starting to go. [chuckles] Do you need some dog food for the kennel? 'Cause I got a ton in my truck. You know what? We could really use some dog food for the kennel. Do you have any extra in your truck? I'll see what I can do. No, I can't see what you're doing. But I trust you. Good boy. You want another one? Come on. You want another treat? Oh, good boy. You're beautiful. Mm-hmm. So, my thought was to create a new fragrance for women on the go. Something that blends with your... natural scent. Uh, and really highlights... the... well, just highlights positive stuff, um, which is why Xtraordinar is truly extraordinary. Um... - It really accents the positive. - [Lindsay whines] Oh, boy. She's not doing too well. - [Jessica] And then it, um... - [Lindsay] I've got to stop this. ...says, "Negative, no way. Get out of here." Okay. Let me just give you guys a sample. Here you go. [Lindsay] Oh, it smells like the Botanical Gardens caught on fire in here. [woman] When will this be available to buy? Um, I can actually give you a free sample. [Lindsay] This is torture. I have to do something about this. [Jessica] So, smell up. No! Lindsay! [Jessica] Lindsay! Oh, no! Lindsay! Oh! [Lindsay barks] - [Lindsay] Hey! This isn't cool! - Does anyone have a towel? I'll clean everything-- Oh, my goodness. Oh, God. Oh, no. [gasps] [women laughing] Lindsay, I appreciate your efforts, but you will not be bothering Ms. Reynolds anymore. You're going to go away and disappear, and I'm going to see to it. [Lindsay] Can't blame this on me. I've been framed. I want to speak to a lawyer. [sighs] [panting] [phone rings] - Speak! - It's Leonard, sir. Um, everything's going great, except for the dog. The dog is terrible. Trying to ruin everything. Oh, God, I hate that dog. Can't you lose it in Montana or something? Isn't there pastures out there you can leave it in? There are a lot of pastures with deep holes. Good. Well, find one that preferably has some wolves or mountain lions or some kind of bear in it or something and leave it there. No way I'm letting that fleabag get in the way of me profiting off Jessica's success. I have worked way too hard watching her work way too hard for this. - You understand me? - Understood, yes. Yes. Leonard, you're my eyes and ears out there. If she blinks, if she sneezes, if she even breaks wind, I want to know about it. I want to know what it smells like, what it sounds like, the texture. And I want a demonstration, you hear me? - Okay. - Over and out. [panting] - Hey, buddy. - Call me Frank. - Franklyn? - Whatever. Okay. Well, with your local knowledge, do you have any way of making a dog disappear? - You mean... [whooshing] disa-- - No, no. No, no. Just hidden for a while. Right down the road. Big Sky Animal Shelter. Will you take that dog there? Here you go. Will that do? Okay. And my bag is getting heavy. Will you take it to our next appointment? We'll be walking. Okay? Thanks, Franklyn. [vehicle approaching] [Lindsay] Unfair, I say. This treatment shouldn't happen to a dog. [gasps] Hey, this place smells familiar. Can I help you? Uh, yes, ma'am. I've got this rather rambunctious little dog. I need a place for him to stay for a few hours. A place to play. Yeah, that'll be fine too, yeah. Oh, no, no, we don't charge fines. We take all animals here. However, we do take donations. Er, yes, thank you very much. I'll be back by the end of the day to pick him up. Thank you very much. - Lindsay? - Hey, Delilah. [laughing] Ooh. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. There you go. [chuckles] Hey, I noticed you're also running low on some bedding pads, so I'll run into town and pick some up. You're going into town? Could you pick us up some bedding pads? We're kinda running low here. [chuckles] That's a good idea, Delilah. Yeah. Still sharp as a twig. [chuckles] Be back soon, girl. Keep an eye on her. [Lindsay] Wait, was he talking to me? Tack! Tack! I'm sharp as a tack! [sniffing] [Lindsay] Hey! That's my sister's sock! - [brown dog] Finders keepers! - [Lindsay gasps] Stealers weepers! You're a dead dog if I can catch you. Hey! Get back here, that's min! [brown dog laughs] Mine now. Uh-huh, uh-huh. So then what happened? So, I go up to that chicken and I say in my scary voice, "You better start laying eggs, Bucko, or else!" Or else what? Well, that's what's great about "or else." You don't need specifics. It's like the worst thing you can imagine. Let me tell you, Bucko the chicken started laying eggs. Zeik! Where you going in such a hurry? Running away from you. Hey, what's the big idea? Pardon me. I was just chasing... [both] Why do you look like me? [both] Stop repeating what I'm saying! [both] Stop it! I mean it! [both] Jinx! Who put a mirror in here? Why do you two look alike? - Haley? - Lindsay? [chuckles] Freaky Friday! Nah, that's a different movie, Zeik. - Sis? - Wha-- - Where you been? - Sis! LA with Jess. What about you? Right here with Mel. We never left the old homestead. Remember? Actually, it's kind of hazy. I was just a puppy back then. What was I, chicken liver? We have lots of catching up to do. What brings you back? Jess is doing a publicity tour for the new smell she invented. [Haley] Huh? Jess smells? [Lindsay] All the time. It's her business. She's a professional smeller. I don't mind, but I don't like the people she smells with. She has this assistant, Leonar, who hates me. I don't care for him either. And she's engaged to this Powers guy I really don't trust. [Haley] At least she's with someone. Mel's all alone. He acts like he's cool with it, but I can sense he's lonely, even with me around. I think he misses Jess. [Lindsay] I barely remember Mel, but I bet Jess would be better off with him than Powers and Leonard. [Haley] Hey, wouldn't it be great if Jess and Mel got back together? [Lindsay] Then we could be a family again. But, wait... When we get back to LA, she's getting married. [Haley] Well, we cannot let that happe. You have to stop her from leaving so we can hook our humans back up. How? I don't know the detours in this town like you do. I got it! I got it! [gasps] Fleas again? No, Zeik. We switch places. I'll be you, and you be me. - Say what? - Once they figured out they have the wrong dog, they'll have to return us to each other. Crisscross. Then we all meet in the middle like a deer in headlights. Bam! It'll never work. We're nothing alike, personality wise. I got plenty of personality. I'm talking about the way you act. You're too... country. And proud of it! If you're going to be me, you have to have a certain amount of class. Walk tall, watch your manners, only eat meat that is well cooked or at the very least medium rare. No problemo. And if you're gonna be me, you gotta get a little down and dirty. Don't be a stick in the mud. Play. Let loose. Pee where you want, when you want, and make no apologies. Oh, and there's one more thing. [Lindsay] Hey! What are you doing? [gasps] Oh, my God. I'm naked! Give me a break. Now you pull off mine. Fancy, fancy. Well, I think that went wonderfully, Ms. Reynolds. Better than last time. Lindsay? Where's my dog? Why isn't she in the car? I thought she was. Franklyn, where's Ms. Reynolds' dog? - At the animal shelter, like we spoke. - What? You put Lindsay in an animal shelter? Why would you do something like that? - We'll get her back, ASAP. - Yes, we will. Not happy about this. Not happy at all. Shh. Shh. [Lindsay] Hey, Delilah. Hoping you can help us out. What happened here? [Haley] I don't know about this. I hope she gets it. Ah, you two! All right. There. Yeah. Stay. All right, hang on. [Haley] Success! Let the games begin! [Mel clears throat] All right. Here you go, Delilah. Where am I going? I don't know where you're going, Delilah, but I'm going. I'm going home. - Oh. - I gotta start cooking if I'm gonna be ready for the fair. Mm-hmm. What's this? These are bedding pads. See you later, Delilah. No, I won't see you. I'm going blind, remember? [whistles] Let's go, Haley! Time to go. Playtime's over! Okay. So how will we stay in contact? Don't worry. I'll find you. Okay. I trust you. Good luck. [Mel] Haley, come on! Hey. Yeah! Oh, yeah! Hey. Hey, girl. Hey, did you miss me? Yeah, I missed you. It's good to see you too. Yeah, come on. Homeward bound. Let's go. All right, Delilah, we'll see you later. Lindsay? Lindsay better be here. I'm sorry, I just thought it would be in the dog's best interest to... not be at the presentations. Delilah? Jessie Reynolds! Oh... Wonderful. I knew someone important was coming to town. Oh, my goodness. So, you're still working here. Dear, I may be too old for men, but one is never too old for dogs. Well, I hear that dogs take better care of you than men anyway. Oh! You're telling me. They certainly do. [chuckles] - How long are you here for? - Uh... Just a-- just a short while. We're just passing through, really. - Oh. - Is Lindsay here? Yeah. - She is. Yes. - Oh. Oh, thank God. Lindsay! Oh, my goodness! Girl! - Oh, Lindsay! - Jessie! Aw, I've missed ya. I've missed you, girl. Oh, my goodness. [Delilah] A girl and her dog. There's no sweeter thing on earth. You're planning to see Mel while you're here? Uh, no. Um... I don't think so. I doubt if he'd really want to see me again. [Delilah] Oh, I doubt that you're right about that. Do you see Mel often? [Delilah] I don't see much often anymore, dear. I'm blind as a beagle. Blind as a bat! Speaking of bats, we should be using our echolocators and going to the airport. Who's your lovely tall lady friend, dear? [chuckles] This is Leonard. Well, that's a strange name for a gal, in Montana anyway. [laughs] We should really be going. Tight schedule, and this place smells like... [Delilah] I like it too. Take a deep breath... through your nostrils, and you're home! [laughs] [Leonard] Okay. It was so good to see you. - Take care, Delilah. - These days, I'll take what I can get. [all laughing] All right. Come on, Lindsay girl, let's go. - So nice to meet you. Lessie, Lesley? - Leonard. - Leonard. - Lesley. Nice to meet you, Lesley! - You're lovely. Bye. Take care of Jess. - I'm going. All right, bye. [Lindsay] My home. My real home! Come on. Got some stew to cook. You got some eating to do. It's dinnertime. [Lindsay] Dinner sounds like an excellent idea to me. [Haley] Jeez. Never been in a spaceship before. I'm sorry that I yelled at you, Leonard. I know you were just trying to help. It's okay, Ms. Reynolds. No harm, no foul. [Haley] Don't get much sun in here, huh. We are a little behind, but we should be able to make the next flight to Dallas. - Franklyn, step on it. - [Haley] Leaving already? Uh-oh. Wait, next flight. Why so quick? I thought that I would have some time to look around and... [scoffs] Why? There's nothing here but wide open spaces infested with wild undomesticated animals, and they stink. [Haley] I speak for all animals when I say, that's pretty offensive. Wow. It's just been a while since I've been back and I thought I'd have a little time. See, Ms. Reynolds. That's exactly the problem. We do have little time. [chuckles] Mr. Andrews runs a tight ship, and he doesn't allow for any dillydallying. Don't I know it. No time to stop and smell the flowers. - Isn't that right, Lindsay? - [Haley] That's a good idea. I think we should stop and smell the flowers. - Lindsay. - [Haley growling] Lindsay, what has gotten into you? - I think she needs to go out. - No. It'll throw us off schedule. We're not stopping. Franklyn, continue. - [Jessica] Franklyn, please stop the car. - [Leonard] We're not stopping. - [Haley] Oh, yeah? - Oh. Lindsay, stay away from my shoes! No. Franklyn, yes, we can stop. We can stop right now, very briefly. Are you serious? - Argh. - [Haley sighs] - [Leonard] It's okay. - No, Lindsay. No. Oh, disgusting animals. Haley, it's your favorite. Num Nums. [Lindsay] Oh, this is disgusting! What is this? What? You love this stuff. [Lindsay] You're serving me poison. I think Haley's been humoring you. Oh, you want some of my stew? Okay, well, let me finish cooking it, princess, then I'll give you some. [Lindsay] We need to have a serious conversation about diet. [Haley] Oh, boy. I need to come up with something fast. This better not take too long. [Haley] I need to find the scent, and I need to find the trail. Wow. It really is beautiful. We don't get vistas like this in LA. [Haley] It's this way. Time for a little hide-and-see. Lindsay! Lindsay! [Haley chuckles] Better come get me! She's never done this before. We have really got to get going, or we are going to miss the last flight. I'm not leaving without my dog. I'll get her. Lindsay! - [Haley] I'm pretending to not hear you. - Lindsay. - Hey, come on. - I'm calling Powers. Looks like we're spending the night. [Lindsay] This place is disgusting. He could use some help around here. A maid or something. [doorbell rings] Surprise! Yes, it is. Uh... Sally, it's really great to see you, always. But why are you here? Well, I thought you could use some more supplies to make your famous stew. I'm pretty much all set. Well... you know, these bags are getting kind of heavy. Oh, yeah. Let me take those. Come on in. - Hi, Haley. How do I look? - [Lindsay growls] Like competition. [Haley] Peekaboo. Come on, Jess, love awaits. - Follow me! - [Jessica] Lindsay! Hey, come on. Now is not playtime. [Haley giggles] Catch me if you can. Where are you going? Lindsay. Lindsay! [Haley] This is so much fun. - Hey! Where are you going? - I'm so good at this. Follow me and you'll see. [sighs] [grunts] Are you serious? [Sally Ann] Oh, so that's your secret ingredient? [Mel] Shh. Can't tell anyone. - Or you'll have to kill me. - Yeah. Put you in one of my stews. Call me the demon farmer of beef street. [laughs] - Oh, smells delicious. - Mmm. Wait until you taste it. My lips are ready. [Lindsay] You better not kiss her. Don't do it! Ah! Haley! What's gotten into you? - I am so sorry. - [barks] Look, she hasn't done something like that since she was a puppy! Or, I don't know, maybe that was Lindsay. Tastes good. You wanna lick? Uh... Look, you could, uh, go upstairs and just take off your... Put on one of my shirts, towel... [exhales] What is wrong with you? [Lindsay] Uh... I plead the Fifth. Lindsay! What has gotten into you? Is it the Montana air? Wait a minute. We're not... I don't believe it. You found your way home. It's like nothing's changed. [Haley] That's right. You're home again. Hopefully forever. All right. Come on. - We gotta go. - [Haley] Hold your horses, honey. Stay a while. Trust me. [sighs] I wonder if he's home. I thought that you liked Sally Ann, huh? What, are you getting jealous, girl? [Lindsay] Her? Please. There is someone better out there for you. You know, Sally and I are just friends. Just friends. [sighs] I don't know. Maybe I should rethink that. Face the facts. Jess is never coming back. Delilah's right. I should move on with my life. - Right? - [Lindsay] Wrong. So wrong. Lindsay. Lindsay. Hey, get over here. Lindsay! No, come here. Hey. Come on. Well, I guess Mel found someone too. [Haley] Uh-oh. She's not supposed to be here. All right, Lindsay. Let's go. We don't wanna disturb them, do we? [Haley] No! This is some kind of mistake. Sally Ann and Mel aren't an item. He's still in love with you. Trust me on this one. All right. Come on, girl. [phone ringing] Oh, shoot. [phone ringing in the distance] Hi, Powers. Hello? Is that you? Hey, what's going on there? You missed your flight. Is everything okay, sweetie pie? No. Yes. Uh, Lindsay ran away, but I found her. You don't have anything to worry about. [Lindsay] This is about to get good. Wait, what's that? Speak up. - I can't hear you. - I'm fine. I just can't talk any louder than this. - Let me call you back. - Jessica? Mel! [Haley] This is so exciting! Back together again. You didn't tell me he had a girlfriend! Relax. They're just friends. [laughs] Fancy seeing you here. [stammers] My home is usually a good place to find me. Wh-- - Why are you here? - I'm not here. - I mean, I'm here, but I'm not staying. - Not where? - Who? What? Where are you? Who is that? - Um... I'm at Mel's place. Mel Danberry, your ex-boyfriend? - Yes. - Who are you talking to? - Powers Andrews. - Yes? - He's my fiancé. - What? Mel's your fiancé? - No! No, you are. - I'm your what? - My ex-boyfriend. - You're breaking up with me? - No, I'm marrying you. - What? I'm so confused. What on earth is going on out there? - My hands are sweating. They never sweat! - What's going on here? Who's she? Well, this is not helping our cause. They were going to kiss. I had to improvise. This is Jessica Reynolds. I thought you two broke up. [both] We did. Powers, listen, there's nothing going on here. I'm gonna have to call you back. - Hello? Hello? Hello? - [phone beeps] Oh, no. I'm sorry, um... I didn't mean to bother you. I just... happened to be in the neighborhood. - In the neighborhood. - Chasing Lindsay. - [barks] - Oh, my God. Lindsay. Oh, my God, Lindsay. Look at you! Oh, my God. Look how much you've grown. [chuckles] Yeah, so has Haley. I mean, you can barely tell them apart. [Lindsay] That's the concept in a nutshell. Well, it's good to see you, girl. [Haley] Yeah. It's been three hours. Missed you too. [barks] Talk to Jess. So, she ran away, what, from Los Angeles? No, I'm actually here on a publicity tour for my new perfume. Xtraordinar. You sure are. [Haley] I knew it! The flame still burns. [Lindsay] We're geniuses. Would you like to come in? No, I don't wanna intrude. Besides, it looks like you've got your hands full. Oh, Mel and I were just cooking and I got all wet. You don't say. - [Lindsay] She did not just say that. - [Jessica] Um... Why don't you just point me to the road? Where's your car? My limo? Um... I think it's back there somewhere. - Come on, Lindsay. - [Lindsay] I'm not going anywhere, Jess. Where you staying? I don't know. I'm sure my assistant, Leonard, will find me a place. Come inside. Come on, five minutes. [sighs] [Lindsay] So, we got them together. Now how do we keep them together? [Haley] Don't worry. Love is in the air. [Lindsay] Really? All I smell is perfume and beef stew. Leonard! Oh... I am bitterly disappointed in you. Jess is supposed to be on a plane right now. And you know where she is? Huh? You know where she is? You know where she is? She is at her ex-boyfriend's house! [Leonard] I will have her on a plane first thing tomorrow, sir. Oh, you better! Because the buyers tracking report says that Xtraordinar is going to be a huge success! Which means Jess is going to be filthy rich, which means I am going to be filthy rich when we are married. And nothing is going to get in the way of that. Not some rabid ex-boyfriend, and certainly not that flea-ridden dirtbag that she calls a dog! Argh! [sighs] Okay, okay. [exhales] Breathe and calm. You are in control. You are in control of this. The world is your oyster. Lauren, get me a ticket to Montana! Now! Ah... So... Publicity tour, a limo... personal assistant, a new fiancé. Well, you've done well for yourself. Living my LA life. [both chuckle] That's wonderful. You look great. And you seem happy. [phone ringing] - You don't need to get that? - Uh, no, it can wait. Um... Yeah, I mean, city life, you know, can be a little overwhelming but I mean, I really can't complain. So... how 'bout you? - Sally Ann, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, she's great. She runs the grocery store downtown. So, it's business and pleasure. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you could say that. [Haley] Why aren't they kissing? - [Lindsay] Here comes one of the reasons. - Hey, I should get going. Looks like you guys have some catching up to do, so... Oh, nonsense. I'm really the one who should be going. [Haley] No! Absolutely not! And you know what they say. - Two's company, but... - Three's a ménage a trois. [Haley] I don't speak French. [Lindsay] Crowd. I think it means "crowd" in French. I'm gonna call Leonard to pick me up. No. No, no. Don't be silly, okay? Look, I will take you to town. - Let me just go put my stew away. - [sighs] Gravy. Uh-huh. [Haley] What now? [Lindsay] Mel and Jess need some alone time together. That's what. You know, I could give Jessica a ride back to town. - It's no bother. - No, listen, you've done enough, Sally. Thank you. Besides, looks like Haley and Lindsay are inseparable again. Just like old times. It is. Okay, well, I'll see you at the fair tomorrow when you take first prize. I've got the gravy stains to prove it. [Lindsay] They just need more time together. So, let me just fix this truck. - What's that gonna do? - You'll see. Just let me get this in here a little bit. - This better work. - It will. Trust me. I guess I don't have a choice, do I? That should do it. - [car honking] - Gravy stains, huh? It's actually a funny story with that one. I bet. Why don't you tell me on the ride back to town? Okay. Are you taking the back road into town? It's quicker. Oh, so you're trying to get rid of me? [laughs] No. No, no. No, that's not it. I-- I thought maybe you might be in a hurry, so I... I'm kidding. Besides, I wouldn't blame you. I did show up unexpected. [laughing] Yeah. Yes, that was definitely a surprise. And it was not an unpleasant surprise. Well, you were always, like, full of surprises. I thought I would just try it for a change. What the... No, no, no. No, not now, no! What? You've gotta be kidding me. [coughing] Oh, God. I think we threw a rod. I don't understand. This truck's never given me any trouble before. Well, can you fix it? [Mel] No. This isn't going anywhere. Okay. Well, I'll just call the local gas station. Do you know the numb-- Minor problem. No reception. - Do you have a cell phone? - Nope. Well, as you know, don't really work out here. Plus, I'm not a big fan of being on call 24/7. [Jessica chuckles] Yeah, I remember. All right. So, what do we do? Walk? Well, it's probably about 20 miles to town. And ten miles back to my place. But I do have some camping equipment in the back. I'm hungry. What are we gonna eat? How do you like your eggs? - Raw? I-- - Scrambled, over-easy, sunny-side up? [Haley] Let's leave these two alone for a bit. It's pretty good. All without the help of takeout. You should try my beef stew. Best beef stew in the county. I believe it. I've made improvements, you know. I can tell. So, what about this, um, Powers guy? Huh? Does he cook for you? [Jessica] I wouldn't exactly call Powers the hands-on type. Unless it comes to money contracts. But I don't wanna talk about him. Can't remember the last time I went camping like this. June 10, 2012. We were coming back from your mom's. We got home and found that an army of cats had taken over our place. And turned it into their own personal litter box. [both laughing] Took a whole week to fumigate. Insert cat joke here. Well, so we went on that camping trip. I really hope they kiss soon. Yeah, me too. You remember the exact date? No, no. I just made it up. I made it up. Thought it might impress you. Trying to impress me. Why? Look at you. You're this big city girl. You come back and visit your old country boyfriend. [chuckles] Come on. How am I supposed to compete with that? Compete with that whole LA lifestyle. There's no competition. [clears throat] Two totally different worlds. I think I prefer this place. Don't have skies like this in LA. We live in a condo. What's a sky? [Mel] LA. Must be exciting. It gets old sometimes. This gets old. [Jessica laughs] This is beautiful. It sure is beautiful. Now kiss! Come on! It's almost like you planned for your truck to break down. Yeah. I planned this whole thing. Planned for my truck to break down. Then you must have planned for no cell service. Uh-oh. I think they're onto us. Let's give the lovebirds some privacy. [both] No. No. Oh. You can use the sleeping bag. There's only one. I usually only need one. For you and... Ms. Gravy Stains? There's nothing between Sally Ann and I. You said you don't want to talk about Powers. I don't want to talk about Sally Ann. Deal? Fair enough. To be even more fair... If you promise to behave yourself, I'll let you share the sleeping bag with me. I'm good. [scoffs] You're chilly. Stop acting stupid. Oh. So, now you're calling me stupid, huh? Yeah. Only when you act stupid. Now I remember why we split up in the first place. Oh, you're just now remembering that? Uh-huh. You're funny. It's a gift. If you say so. I always say so. [clears throat] Move over. [both grunting] Let me just get in a little. Can you move over? - [grunts] - Okay. - Okay. - [both giggling] Did you check for snakes? [laughs] Oh... Are you okay? I'm perfect. Look, they're together. Let's make sure they stay together. - [zipper closing] - Be careful! [Lindsay] I've got this. Relax. Yo! Any word from Ms. Reynolds? I checked the Danberry ranch. Nada. I called her 27 times last night. She didn't call me back and didn't answer. She didn't do anything. I know she's dead. I'm gonna lose my job again just like in Milan. She was probably abducted by some militia lumberjack organization and now I'm going to lose my job. [phone ringing] I've got to take this. [exhales sharply] Jessica! Oh. You still haven't found her, have you? Not-- not yet, Mr. Andrews. - All right. Well, pick me up. - [chuckles] Physically? I don't think I'm strong enough for that, sir. No. No, no, no. I'm at the airport. Or at least what they call an airport. It's more like a barn surrounded by planes. But I just arrived. You're in Montana? Yes, I took the red-eye. I'm exhausted. Please hurry. I do not like to wait. To the airport, fast. Wait! I'm supposed to be in the car. Aw. So cute. They look so happy. Why did they break up? Mel never talks about it. Had something to do with her job, his dream, the house, but I think she's been longing for a change. [snorts] Oh... Morning. Uh, yeah, good morning. Yeah. [grunting] It's a little snug in here, don't you think? Yeah, it's a one-person sleeping bag. - [straining] Okay. - Okay. Let me see if I can get the zipper... Okay, it's not... What is it? It's not going. I think it's... It's broken. - Very funny, Mel. - No, I'm not joking. Oh. Come on. - You've got to get me out of this thing. - I can't. Okay, hair is everywhere. Everywhere! - Well, yeah. That's because it's attached to my head. - No, and in my face. Okay, well, maybe if you didn't have such big, stupid broad shoulders, maybe you'd get out of this thing by now. - Oh, nice, nice. So, now I have stupid shoulders? - Uh-huh. - Yeah. - Yeah, nice. - Okay. - Why'd you zip us in so tight? Look, I didn't. Yeah, then who did? What, the dogs? [Lindsay] I don't know what you're talking about. - [both sigh] - Okay, look. Listen, I got a pocketknife, but I can't reach it... - Okay. - ...so just, you give me a reach-around-- Oh, no, I am not giving you a reach-around. - All right. Let's sit up. - Okay. - One, two, three. - One, two... - [grunting] Okay. - Okay, all right. - All right, let's just... - We just got to stand up. - Yeah. Okay, ready? And stand. - Wait. [grunting] - Oh, my God! - [laughs] - Okay, yeah. - Okay. Okay, now what, smart guy? This isn't what I meant when I said let's get them together. But I'm kinda enjoying this. - [Jessica screams] - [both grunt] Are you okay? - Are you okay? - [laughing] I'm okay. Oh, no. What did you do? Are they okay? You're taking the blame for this one. That's all right with me. - [both laughing] - Oh, my gosh. That was terrible. Ah. That's one way to wake up. - Let's get out of here. - All right. - Come on. - Come on, girls. Let's go. Let's go. - [horns blaring] - Yo, hey. Hey, come on! Pass the one on the right. Come on! Where do you mountain people learn how to drive? [Haley] So nice out here. If this isn't romantic, I don't know what is. [Lindsay panting excitedly] I've never had so much fun in my life. Wait for me! So, when's the big day? The wedding? Oh, right. Um... When I get back. Powers has the whole thing planned out. Really? He must be quite the guy. - What does that mean? - I don't know. You're letting someone plan out your life for you. Just doesn't seem like you, Jess. Well, look, like I said, you know, the city is different. And everything's faster. Sometimes I just don't have time. To breathe? [chuckles] Or think. It's just rush, rush, rush. Hence the assistant. [laughs] Leonard is probably freaking out right now. He has no idea where I am. Neither do I. That makes three of us. - I thought you said you knew where we-- - Relax. I know exactly where we are. [barking] Hey, looks like Ol' Glory got out of her stall again. Ol' Glory? Jim Parker's horse. You got a good memory. You tired of walking? - Oh, no, we can't take Ol' Glory. - Borrow, borrow. Besides, Jim will be glad if we bring her back. [marching band music] We will find her, Mr. Andrews. Rest assured of that. I'm not rest assured of anything, Leonard. Nothing. Ah. What is going on around here? I don't know. Uh, it's the annual county fair. You know, uh, pie eating contests, rodeo, pig slapping, who's got the nicer cow. Bunch of ranch folk walking around. The usual. I've got a gut feeling that Ms. Reynolds is there. [sighs] Looks like a caveman disco out there. All right, I guess we'll check it out. - Franklyn... - [sighs] You got it. Hey. Hey, girl. Good to see you. Yeah, you up for a little ride? Huh? - [grunts] - [neighs] All right. Come on. What did I tell you? This guy's a stud. This is definitely going to work. Whoa. You remember how to ride? It's like riding a bicycle. Only bigger and an animal. Well... - Ready? Up. - Yep. - There you go. - [laughs] I guess we'll get you back to town. Isn't the fair today? Yeah. Don't you need to get your stew for the contest? I figured you need to be getting back. I have some time. My place it is then. [clicks tongue] Hup. [Lindsay] We're so good at playing matchmaker.

Very old. - Excuse me! - Oh, fantastic. - You! - Yes. - Excuse me! - Huh? - Dear lady, ma'am-- - Mrs. Higgins. My mother was Mrs. Higgins. I'm just Delilah. - Oh. Delilah, do you remember us? - Mm-hmm. I can't say that I do. No, 'cause I don't. Um, we came by yesterday with Jessica Reynolds to collect her dog. Have you seen her? - The dog or the girl? - The girl. We don't care about the dog. Yes, I saw her yesterday. I saw her with you two yesterday. - Since yesterday? - Since yesterday, what? - Have you seen the girl? - Yeah. - Oh. - Getting somewhere. - When? - Yesterday. We're talking about today. Well, why did you bring up yesterday? I mean, are you trying to confuse me? Oh, no, no. It's just... That seems far too easy. No, what we're trying to do is find my fiancée. Jessica Reynolds.

Look, the past is the past, right? No point in living there. If you say so. You should be able to call your assistant now. I'm gonna get my stew and I'll take you back into town. I got another truck by the barn. [Haley] Why is she sad? I thought everything was going according to plan. Hey, Leonard. It's me. [Haley] Come on, we've got to think of somethin. [Lindsay] It smells good in here. Oh, I'm hungry. [Haley] Oh, so good! Now you're hungry. [Haley] I'm always hungry. [Lindsay] How can you eat that stuff? [Haley] Easily. Watch. Try it. It's really good. [Lindsay] No, thank you. - Haley. - What? [Lindsay] What are you doing? I'm you, remember? [Haley] Oops. [Jessica] Hey, is Lindsay in there with you? [Haley] They're gonna bust us. [laughs] [laughs] Okay, this is gonna sound crazy... but I think-- I think our little puppies are playing a trick on us. [chuckles] Okay, what do you mean? Was Lindsay at Delilah's dog park yesterday? Yeah, for a few hours. How did you know that? Haley was there too. They switched places. Their collars got switched. [Haley] We did it for a good cause. [Lindsay] Yeah, we didn't mean any harm. Watch. Haley. - Lindsay. - Yeah. [Haley] Hey! - [laughs] - Hmm? Okay. So... So, you're Haley and that's how you knew how to get back here. And you're Lindsay and that's why you spilled stew on Sally Ann last night. [scoffs] What if my truck breaking down was not an accident? And what, the sleeping bag incident was... [Haley] I think it's time to make an exit. Let's go. - Haley! - Hey, Lindsay, come on! [Haley] Come on, let's hide. [Jessica] So, which dog is which? - Haley! - Lindsay! [both] What? - [laughs] - Ah. Well, nice try, ladies. [Haley] The jig is up. - [Jessica] There you go. - [Mel] I missed you. Yeah. [both sigh] Well, it's getting late. We should go. [girl singing] So, you're gonna stick around for the contest or you taking off right away? Uh... I probably have to take off pretty quickly after we figure out which dog is mine. - Haley! - [Haley] You figured it out already. Oh, there she is. Let's go. Ms. Reynolds, we have been looking everywhere for you. You know, I'm so sorry, Leonard. I got sidetracked. No, no, it's my fault. It's my fault. I take full responsibility for it. Uh... You don't need to take responsibility for it. I believe that we were pawns in a sinister game of manipulation. - [Haley] These guys are trouble. - [Lindsay] Don't listen to them. - Jessie! [chuckles] - Oh, my God. Powers, I didn't think that you would fly all the way out here to-- To the armpit of America? Well, when my star attraction and the love of my life goes missing, I leave no stone unturned. This guy's the worst. - [clears throat] - Oh, um... Powers, um, this is Mel, um, my good friend. Mel, this is Powers Andrews, my fiancé. And this is Leonard, my assistant, and Franklyn, my driver. It's nice to meet you guys. I would shake hands, but... Oh, I wouldn't want to get my hands all dirty anyway. [laughs] Thank you so much for protecting my little sweet pea here. She's worth protecting. You're a lucky man. Well, I believe that real men create their own luck. The secret to success is raw ambition, a lot of planning... and the right amount of financing. Huh? [laughs] That's funny, 'cause I was referring to your upcoming wedding. Oh! Oh. Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, same rules apply really. [Haley] I don't know what Jess sees in this guy. There you are. Come on, let's go register your stew. I gotta go, Jess. Bye. - Bye. - [Leonard] Good luck with your stew! Well, that's great because now we can catch the 2:15 flight. Excellent! Let's get out of the 1800s and back to modern America. Whoo! - I can't wait to get home. - You know what? I want to stay and see if Mel wins the stew competition. But stew is so gross. Why? Because it's-- it's what I want. [Powers] Oh. Look, coming back here has reminded me of who I was. Who I am. A nobody from a dinky town in a pathetic state filled with people whom to call them backwards would be a compliment. [laughs] Did I say something wrong? Well, get after her! Well, that wasn't in my original job description. Unless you want your original job description to read permanently unemployed, you will bring her right back here to me. Both of you. Go on, scoot! What do we do now? Not sure, but we can't leave her with him. Follow me. [sighs] Phew. What's that smell? - [Haley] Coming through. Watch out. - [Lindsay] Coming through. - Hey, the dogs! - If we follow them, they'll lead us to Ms. Reynolds. Let's go get them. [Lindsay] Watch your step. [Leonard grunting] You think it's funny? [chuckles] Misery loves company. [Leonard] Gah! Take that! That went great. Come on. Follow me. Just in time. Yeah. Do you believe in destiny? You know what? Actually, I do. 'Cause I think we make a really good couple together. - And I think we should-- - Look, Sals, you're a great gal, okay? And you're gonna find the right guy someday, but I'm not him. My heart belongs to someone else. It always has and always will. And I can't let her get away again. I'm sorry. Jessie! I refuse to let you leave this way. Why? Because I'm under contract? No. No, no, no, no. This is not about business. I love you. Powers, everything you do is scheduled and planned and jotted down. Look, I got caught up in that lifestyle too, but that's not what I want anymore. I'm free here, I'm spontaneous. Oh! Spontaneity! That's what you want? If you want spontaneity, I will give you spontaneity. We can get married right here, right now today. Hmm? - Today? - Yes. I'm sure that we can find a justice of the peace somewhere in this windswept wasteland that can perform the ceremony. [phone ringing] Hold that thought. Ooh! Hello. Yeah, hello. - Hello? - Jess! Jess. Jess, I got to tell you something. I'm sorry. Okay, I was wrong. I was wrong for not supporting you. Your career, your dreams, your goals. I was selfish. I was selfish for trying to keep you here. They say if you love something, you should set it free, not force it to stay. What would you say if they came back? - [Haley] Yeah! - [Lindsay] We did it! We did it! [Haley] Whoo-hoo! We're the best! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! That is my future wife you're kissing! Ex-future wife. Oh, no, no, no. You're mistaken. He's the ex. Not anymore. Mr. Danberry! Congratulations! You're a winner. I certainly am. No! I am the one who always wins around here. I am the winner. So, unless you want to lose everything... the car, the house, the jewelry, all of the clothes, oh, and also your highly lucrative perfume contract, all those dreams, poof, up in smoke! Powers. Look, you're confusing your dreams with mine. Everything I want is right here. I'm sorry, Powers. I'm done. Never say sorry unless you also say not sorry. Sorry, not sorry. Sorry, not sorry. Ah, Leonard, please shut up. No, you shut up. Ms. Reynolds is right. You have never said one nice thing to me in all the time I've worked for you. I quit. I'm leaving you too. I do quit. I quit. - I'm done. - Whatever! [Lindsay] All right, I'm taking this guy out. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! - [barking] [laughs] [wincing] How's this for closure? [Lindsay] Diamonds are a dog's best friend. Thank you. - No! - Oh, no, no, no, no! Do you know how much that ring cost me? Oh, you stupid mutt. [groans] Oh, oh, oh. What about the wedding? [laughs] ["Wedding March" playing] [Haley] The moment we've all been waiting for. I prepared a little gem. Extraordinary. Mel. [scoffs] Oh, I've waited so long for this.
