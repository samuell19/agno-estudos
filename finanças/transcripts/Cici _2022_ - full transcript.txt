NETFLIX PRESENTS ["Eine kleine Nachtmusik" by Amadeus Mozart playing] [woman in Turkish] I'm a nurse. Yet another day begins for us nurses. - Good morning. - [male patient] Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. - How are you? - Better, thanks. - How was your night? - It was great. - Any complaints or needs? - No complaints. ["Eine kleine Nachtmusik" by Amadeus Mozart continues playing] A nurse is a doctor's biggest aide, and without a doubt, a patient's biggest support. [female nurse] I love my job. Being a nurse is all about love. Loving people, supporting them, helping them get their health back. Without any distinction or discrimination, we serve people with health problems who are in need of care and attention. We care for them, comfort them... [TV zaps] [fire crackling] [sheep bleating] [birds calling] [footsteps approaching] [chicken clucking] [laughs] [man] May your homes be full of happiness, days full of joy, meals full of flavor. Let's continue this conversation through music. May God bring the ones who fell apart together, and cast away all evil. May God protect our beautiful country, our peace and harmony, and our unity against external powers. Let the roast cook, let our heroes celebrate. Let's go!

[lighter clicks] [sheep bleating] You already had a camera, did you bring the old one? Of course I did. So why'd you get another one? - It's different. - [man 1] How so? [man 2] It records audio.

Didn't even make it to town. - [man 2] May Allah forgive his sins. - [man 1] Amen, inshallah. I was in Ankara. I came back and went home. I looked at my wife, she'd been crying. I knew something happened. I said, "Who?" She said, "Your brother, I'm sorry." I fell to my knees. My first thought was about his boy. His mother died in childbirth. No siblings and now, no father. I said he'd stay with us. [boy continues singing in Turkish] - [man 2 in English] He's like me, huh? - [man 1] Like how? Give me a cigarette. I never met my father. He was old, a heart attack got him too. [boy in Turkish] ♪ I climbed up the mud wall ♪ [in English] I lost my mother, too. She was young, younger than Havva when she died. It's hard. I would know. I didn't immigrate here just for fun. Cemil! Come here, boy, now. Hurry, come over. Kiss his hand first, Uncle Bekir. Brother Bekir, he's yours if you want him. If he makes any mistakes, you can give him a good beating. You better not be lazy, kid. You'll come every morning like today, and work. And in the evening, without dawdling, head to the village. There's no transportation here, but you can walk, right? You're old enough. - Do you understand? - I do, Uncle. - [man 1] All set? - Yes, Uncle. Alright, then. I'll grab the cigarettes. [man in Turkish] And now, sports. In the Turkish First Football League, Sarıyer and Ankaragücü tied 2-2. In the Turkish Second League Category A, Gençlerbirliği has secured the title. Sarıyer faced Ankaragücü in Istanbul at the Yusuf Ziya Öniş Stadium. [snores] [news reporter] We're 65 minutes in. Feridun with a cross. Silva with a beautiful finish. Sarıyer 1, Ankaragücü 0.

Didn't I tell you not to go in there? Huh? That you're not allowed to open the cupboard? Huh? Didn't I tell you not to play with the cameras? Huh? [sighs] You're gonna send me to town again? Huh? Havva? I'm not sending you anywhere. - Who does, then? - You choose to go. Don't even start. Why do I go? 'Cause I want to? You're ravenous. You're insatiable. That's why you go. [sighs] Like a starving dog? And I should leave you be? [sighs] I gave you three children, isn't that enough? [sighs] Another man would give you a good beating. You should pray that I'm above that. 'Cause I haven't beaten you, not once. I've never even hit you. Count your blessings. You should pray that I'm above that. [sighs] [cries] [animals murmur] Bismillah. [grunting] [cowbells chime] Cemil, son. I need you to gather the herd, quickly. As you command, sir. As you command, huh? Am I your commander? Come on now, get them together. Let's go. [sighs] Listen. Cemil is another brother to you. We have four children now. Look at me as a father, not "sir". You see me as a commander, that won't do. You should see me as a father. And think of them as siblings. What is Kadir, then? Your brother. And Yusuf? Your brother. And Saliha? My sister.

Dad's out. He's in the village today, so we had it on. There wasn't another song you could've played? We're just dancing. [Havva] To that song? If you're gonna dance, pick cheerful music! You didn't think of that? My God. You'll dance to that? It's cheerful! Kinda... The hell it is! [footsteps fading away] [laughs] - [pots clanging] - [laughs] Dad, will we go to college? Your son asked a question. What'll you study? You don't know? Why go if you don't even know that? Master Yusuf, will you go to college? What'll you study? How to drive a car. Driving a car? Well, well. Look at that. You don't need college for that, son. The car's out front. Go out there and get your education. [sniffs] [sighs] Look at that. See, your brother knows. You figure out what you want to study first. How can he really know without going? That's what I'm saying. What college will he go to? They will go to college. They all will. Is that so? - Where? - In Ankara. - Ankara, huh? - Where everyone goes. - Who's everyone? - Where you go to study! Remember, the mayor's eldest son went. And? He went, and then what? He found a job? He got rich? - Those are the only options? - What else? He went, and then what? He came back an anarchist. You think every student becomes an anarchist? - If not, what do they become? I'm asking. - What's your question? Havva! - I don't know. - You don't know what? They will go to college, they all will. - All? - Yup. You said "all". - You'll go, too? - [Havva] She'll be the first one. - [Bekir] Is that so? - [Havva] She's the oldest. So she's up first. She'll go to nursing school. [Bekir] Uh-huh. You figured out a school. Is there a hospital in town? Where will she work? - In Ankara, obviously. - Saliha? In Ankara? And you've sent the boys away. Who'll take care of the land? The crops and the goods? - [Havva] We'll handle it. - Who'll take care of us? We're okay now, but what about when we're old and weak? I'll take care of you, Papa. Your mom sent you to college. I don't want to. [Bekir] That's my girl. What are you saying? - [Bekir] That she won't go to college. - Then what'll you do? [Bekir] She's saying, "I'll look after you." She's saying, "I won't leave you." My smart girl, my good girl. You won't abandon your dad, will you? What's that look? You're gonna beat her up? If you want it so bad, you go to Ankara.

Stand right there, over there. I'm going to make a joke now, watch. Come here. You go there, that's good. The hose. Take the hose. - Spray it. Come here. - Dad. Dad. Come here. Here. Right here.

Ah, aren't you the one with a sense of humor? Didn't... Didn't you want to play this game? You started it. We've got a camera and a joke, so let me see you laugh. C'mon, laugh, it's funny. Laugh. Laugh. What's happening? What are you doing, Bekir? - What're you doing? Don't! - What a great joke. - Bekir, stop it. Stop it! - You stay out of this. Stay out of it!

One of them navy, with stripes. Sevtap... Sorry. A Mercedes in pristine condition. Come on, Adem. [woman on TV] You can do it, Adem! Keep running. Come on! [pots clattering] - You're going so well! - [Bekir laughing] [woman on TV] Come on! Keep going. You can do it! Keep going! Faster! [in English] For you. - What is it? - Linden tea. I made a pot for Kadir. Alright. [in Turkish] Bravo, Adem. Come on, let's go. [snoring] [wind whistles] [window creaks] [in German] Ah! Turks out! [breathes heavily] [rain patters] [Turkish pop music playing] [Bekir in English] Havva! Tell them to turn it down. Or my head's gonna explode. Havva! [grunting and sighing] [coughing] I'm sick as a dog. [Havva] You still don't feel any better? You've been sick more than three weeks, Bekir. Should we call a doctor? I could call the clinic. No need for a doctor. No need for a doctor. - [sighs] - [Havva] Really? Yeah. Inshallah. Enough, that's enough. [grunting] Havva! Hey, where's your mother? Come closer, little driver. Think you can help your papa get out of bed? Go for it. Pull, pull. [grunts] Huh. Okay. Let's get some air. I've been in bed long enough. I just need a bath at the hammam. Huh, Yusuf? The village is an hour away, that'll be fine. The gas to get there would be what, three liras? Let's get ourselves scrubbed nice and clean. We'll lie on the hot stones, too. So I can get better. That's all I need. Once I find the energy to get behind the wheel, it's over. Let's take your brother too. Ugh, your useless brother. Why is he like that? Huh, Yusuf? [snorts and grunts] What are we gonna do with him? You're a good boy right? You better be. One is enough. We can't handle two troublemakers. - Tell me that you'll be good. - [Yusuf] I'll be good. - [Bekir] What? - [Yusuf] I'll be good. [Bekir laughs] Excellent. Excellent, my sweet boy. [sniffs] I'm taking my son to the hammam. We'll drive to the village and we'll eat kebab from the market, huh? Right? - [Yusuf] Yeah. - [Bekir groans] [Yusuf] We're driving in the car? [Bekir] Of course we are. How else would we get there? [Yusuf] Then let's go! [Bekir laughs] You little rascal. [coughs] My little driver. Hey, if you get a little taller, then I'll teach you how to drive. Your brother first, then you. - How's that sound? - [Yusuf] Good. [Bekir] Good, good. That's good. [sighs] I'm taking my son to the hammam. To the hammam. [coughing] [grunts] [Yusuf] Papa fell down! Papa fell down! Papa fell down! Come on, laugh! Laugh, why don't you? - Dad please! Dad! - Put your hands down! Look at me! Look at me! There. There you go. How's the joke, idiot? Huh? You started it, it's your joke! How's that? Huh? Is that good? Huh? Is it funny? You little shit. Hey! Turn around. Turn towards me. Turn! You little shit. Asshole. [man] C'mon. C'mon, guys. Who bumped the camera? - [woman] Orkun? - [Orkun] It wasn't me! [man] Guys, whoever's bumping the camera, that was the second time. [cameraman] No one's touching it, it's the uneven ground. [man] Okay, okay. - Let's change lenses. - [actor sighs] [man] Let's try the 75, let's see the 75. - [cameraman] We're going closer? - [man] No, stay there. Let's see that lens. [actor exhales] - [man] You're still rolling! - [assistant] Tail slate! Slate! Alright, take two! [actor] I'm really roasting in this coat, Kadir! Can we break for two minutes? I'm roasting! [Kadir] Don't break yet, please. We're scheduled for one after this. - [cameraman] Kadir. - [Kadir] Yes. The sun came out. What's your call? Should we wait or continue? Keep going, and hurry please, I want another take before lunch. Alright. I'm warning you, though, the light won't be the same. You might not be able to use these 'cause of continuity. A warning and he's gone. - You want another one? - Go ahead. Your mom apparently said she doesn't want make-up. You'll talk to her, right? The girls weren't comfortable pushing her. Why are they doing make-up on her at all? That's ridiculous, there's no reason for her to wear make-up. No, nothing dramatic. Just powder to cut the shine on her face. - And? - She said she doesn't wanna wear it. [sighs] Okay, I'll talk to her. Oh, mom, you're in here? I was looking for you. Why are you standing? You can sit. Sit, sit here, come. There we go, sit. Saliha, why is he doing this now, this kid? - What kid? - Kadir. Doing what? Bringing all these strangers to the house. They're a big crew, Mom. It's not easy making a movie. [Havva] Why'd he bring us here? Oh, why would you say a thing like that, Ma? Shh. What's going on? Your mood totally changed. We knew the film was happening. He's been preparing for weeks. Remember? He told you he wants to shoot the film here. I thought he'd just film... Well, I thought he'd just film us, just us, with your dad's camera. Like your papa would. He will, with you. Your acting made the cut, I guess. It's gonna be a nice memory. [Havva] I don't want to. I don't want to be in a movie or anything. [Saliha] Oh Mom, don't do this! I heard you said something to the make-up artist, too. I'm begging you, don't. Think of Kadir... [Havva] I thought he'd film you. I just wanted a picture with my grandchildren. That's all. Now the garden's full of strangers. And why's this kid getting hosed down? Is this about your father? He'd be turning in his grave. [inhales] Was it even winter? Was there snow? Would he have done it then? Papa has nothing to do with it. Your son wrote a script. It's only a movie, Mom. It's one we've seen before. [Saliha] Oh, Mom. It's disrespectful to your father. [Saliha sighs] [girl] Ladies, what are you up to in here? Where'd that come from? Uncle Kadir. I'm filming BTS. It's what he came up with to get rid of me. Turn it off and sit with us. Listen to your grandma. [girl] What's she saying? That she doesn't wanna be in the movie. Our actor's having a diva fit. [girl] What? No way. I don't believe it. That's what she said. [girl] Grandma? Come sit with me, you. Sit. Scooch over more. Sit here. [girl] You've been replaced. [sniffs] - My beautiful girl, oh! - Oh, grandma... This kid's my one and only. - Hmm. - I'll make pastries for you. - Oh! - When they're gone. I will, honey. Hey, why's your uncle doing this, huh, honey? Your trouble-making uncle. - [sighs] He was always trouble. Always! - [girl laughs] The younger one was alright... Little driver. Right, Saliha? Me? Saliha? - Papa called Uncle Yusuf "little driver." - [girl] Oh? We had a car. My dad brought it from Germany. Well, what do we have here? [sighs] Come here, come. - Tell me you're not bored already. - No. So where's our BTS? I was filming, we just had a little crisis in here. What crisis? Listen to what Mom's saying. What's going on, Mom? She's saying she won't let them put make-up on her. Who's doing make-up? No make-up on you! They probably wanted to reduce any shine so we can film you later. Just a bit of powder so the lights don't reflect. Not make-up. Okay, Ma? There wasn't anything else you could've made a movie about? [sighs] Mom, look... I don't like any of this. What do you mean? That scene you were filming outside. She figured it out. She could see from here. Well then, Mr. Director, your actor is unhappy with the script. Mom, why are you saying that? Huh, Ma? I'm not sure. I don't feel well. Find somebody else. - I won't be able to do it. - Oh, no, don't do this. We've set up the scene, we're doing it. Where's this coming from? Ma! [woman] Kadir, we're ready. Don't say no. Not now, please. It's nothing. It'll be over so quickly. - No make-up, no powder, nothing. Got it? - Mhm. Mama, get up. Please, there are a thousand other problems I have to deal with. You don't wanna be on that list, let's go. Kadir... Let's go and we can start in two minutes. Uncle Kadir, wait. She says she doesn't want to. Let's go. Let's go. Up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, it's over. Okay? It's over. What was that? - Where are you going? - We should stand close at least. She'll see us and relax. She seems really out of it. [Kadir] Let's get the window in frame. Tilt up. A hair more. Nope, too much. - Good, lock that. - [cameraman] Locking the frame! [Kadir] Merve. Okay Mom, you'll have Merve right behind you. Just like we talked about before, she'll hand you the tray and whisper in your ear when you should go. Alright? - Right, Merve? - Yes, I'll be right here the whole time. - I'll cue you when you should enter. - Alright, we're all set. Alright, Mom. Okay. You're good. Let's go, then. - [Merve] Orkun, is the frame set? - [Orkun] Set. - [Merve] Sound? - [technician] Speed. - [Merve] Camera? - [cameraman] Rolling. - [marker 1] Scene 50, shot one, take one. - [marker 2] Mark! [Kadir] Action. [clicks finger] [whispering] Okay, right. This is the time to go. [clicks finger] You can do it, go on. [cutlery clinks] [actor groans] [crying softly] Why is she crying? [Havva] Saliha! Saliha! Saliha! [cries] - Cut, cut, cut. - [Havva] Saliha! Cut, everyone! Ma, I'm here! Mama, hey, Ma, it's over. It's okay ma... [Saliha] Mom? Mom, come on. Come on. - [girl] Grandma? - Let's go outside. - [girl] What happened? - You're okay. Let's get you outside. [girl] Let's go. [crying] [exhales] You're gonna remember this when she dies someday. Hm. - Bet that's gonna suck. - What're you saying, Naz? Huh? I don't know. When something happens with my mom I think about that. One time, I kicked her. I was young and I'll never forget it. She was trying to get my shoes on. We had somewhere to get to. And she was bent over in front of me. I was mad and kicked her. Right in the shoulder. It was enough to knock her over. [sighs] She tried to hide it but she started crying. And I know I'll think about it. My mom will die and I'll think of that. [exhales] It's gonna suck. Well I've never kicked my mother, thankfully. Ugh, better not, after everything else. You're the one who got hit. You gotta admit, she's pretty strong. [inhales] That's my grandma. She was like, "Enough of your fucking movie." [laughs] "I'll show you a movie, son!" She's actually amazing, isn't she? I might be biased 'cause she's family, but I don't... But I don't think so. And she's so kind, she's like a perfect human. I might love her more than I love my mom. I might, honestly. If I think about it too hard I'll get a stomach ache. It feels wrong. Hm. It's weird. At least it's not a random person, I don't love Büşra Su's grandma. At least it's my mom's mom, it's like a package deal. I should calm down. [exhales] I won't worry about it. Yeah. You're really a character, you know that, Naz? You meant that? - Who's Büşra Su? - She's this awful girl from school. Total ass-wipe. What kind of name is "Büşra Su" anyway? It's just awful. You didn't come with any intention to make me feel better. It never crossed your mind. Am I wrong? - No. - No. [Havva] Yusuf keeps saying we should sell the house. Will they sell it to make more movies? No. What does Yusuf have to do with any of this, Mom? Well, I don't know. What did you tell him? About selling it? I said this. [laughs] You're so cool. He deserved it. What's that, over there, Saliha? Is it another camera? It is, Grandma. Uncle Kadir wants me to film stuff. - Then you should film something. - Okay, here we go. [camera beeps] I'm filming. Oh, Mom? Hm. A photo would be nice, with my granddaughter. Will you take one for us? It's not that kind of camera. Oh, it's not? We can get photos from the footage. One second, grandma. Take this, Mom. Can you handle it? - Tell me which button to do. - The battery's really low. - We'll go 'til it dies. - Press this, it's going. Come here, grandma. - Hot stuff! - You make sure we look good. [laughs] You look good, you look good. Hm. If you set it there, you can get in. Check the viewfinder first, though, so it's not just the wall. Make sure we'll all fit in the picture. - There. - Okay. I should've worn my glasses. Why? You look great, Grandma! I should've worn my glasses, like the nurse, the one that... We'll find them then. They're around here, aren't they? Hm? At the hospital, she was there. Which hospital? When your Papa was alive. And? There was that nurse. She had this white dress. It was such a bright white. And she wore her hair up, like... Oh, wow, she was the sweetest, Saliha. Oh, you're the sweetest, right Grandma? If we could do one with my glasses... Let's find them, Mom, right now. Where's the last place you saw them? In the great room. They were in the great room. They fell out of my pocket. Why were you looking for them in here? It's dark out there, I couldn't find them myself. [birds calling] [air pumping] [floor creaks] [man on radio] Yücel, where are you Yücel? On my way. - Good morning. - Morning. Have you seen my mom or my daughter walking around? I saw them earlier, they were going for a walk. They might be near the lake. You could check the break area. Thank you. Hey guys, has anyone seen my mother or my daughter? Saliha. Cemil. It's me. Cemil? How've you been? Well? Yes. It's all good. You? You look terrific. I didn't know you were here. [inhales] Why'd you come out? Well, Kadir was in town. He said he's making a movie. - [Saliha] Right... - Yeah, so... So I guess someone was supposed to come from Istanbul and can't now. Um... "We're in trouble, can you help us out?" Are you acting in the film? I'll try to, he said I'd be okay. [laughs] It's a small role. I guess we'll see, right? I mean, I couldn't say no when he asked. That's great. I'm happy to hear that. And how's your life? Good. Good, thank God. You're good too? [Saliha] Good, good. Just here to help with the movie. My mom's here, have you spoken with her? Th... They've had me busy since I got here. I haven't said hello to anyone yet. Well, welcome to the set. Thanks, happy to be here. Let me check on my mom, I'll come find you later. Of course, of course.

You're getting me out of a tight spot. It's nothing. I'd always help you out. It's a big deal. It really is. - You've gotta finish it. - Thank you, for real. You're great. Thank you, you're great.

I'm managing well enough. Anyway, I wanna hear about you. So, did you get married? What? Me? No I didn't. I did not. [grunts] I did, but it didn't really stick. - It happens. - Yeah, I guess. Hey, Let's do another take. - Another take? - Yeah. Let's do another real quick before we break. Oh... I thought that it was over. You're kidding, no, no. We just started. - Really? - Really, yeah. When I shout "Action," go for it. Exactly like last time, you got it. I planned on going back, uh... I have to get to the bank. So, since you said it'd be quick... Ah, but we just got started. I've been here for more than three hours. Ah... They called you early. [Cemil] Oh. What do we do? [sighs and clears throat] I could come back? I'll do it and be back in the afternoon. I'll come straight here. Then I'm free 'til sunset. I can do as much as you want then. No, that won't work. Let's just film it now and finish it. I have several more scenes I need to finish today, after this one. - That makes sense, I just... - Okay, let's do it. - Start now and get it done. Let's reset. - Hey, Kadir. What man? What now? Huh? Why're you getting angry? I'm just explaining myself. Brother. Cemil, my brother. I'm asking you to stay. We've started something. Let's not leave it half-done. Let's go, brother. You can go after we finish the scene. Let's do it. And start when I yell "Action," alright? What if I don't? Would you get the hose and spray me? What? [Naz] What's going on? Is he an actor, Mom? Or what? [Merve] Orkun, are you set? [Orkun] Set. [Merve] Sound? [sound technician] Speed. - [Merve] Camera? - [cameraman] Rolling. Slate! Action.

Not nervous enough. [Naz] Right, Mr. Tansu's realizing it's not sweater weather! [laughs] [tape squeaks] - [Naz] Hot stuff! - You make sure we look good. [laughs] Hm. - If you set it there you can get in. - [mouse clicks] [Kadir crying] [fly buzzes] [woman sighs] - I should go in first. - Wait, you're gonna leave us out here? The house is right in front of us. Just walk. Let me go first and see what's going on. You can follow behind. Are you cold? Why would he be cold? It's summer! Right, you're right. Let me go first, okay? Ow! Ah, Mom! I hit my foot. Wait. Wait let me see. Where's the car? You grew a beard, huh? [exhales] It broke down. And? I got it towed into town, if you can call it a town. What happened? I didn't think there'd be a mechanic, turns out there's a whole industrial area. What's up, brother? Uh... It's just as well. Just as well? I'm trying to say welcome. Oh, thanks, then. Thanks. - You okay? - [Kadir] Your boy's gotten big. He has. He's nine in December. Good for him. Are you high? No. Then what's going on? You should've told someone from town to drive you here. Why'd you make your kid walk? You've been following this corona thing, right? - There's no corona out here. - [Yusuf] That's not how it works. Not yet, then. What if we have it? Have you visited dad? [grunts] There's a gardener. You should go, yourself. I live too far away, you should check on his grave. They have a professional for that. - No, to say prayers or something. - If you insist. What? Why? Anyway, should we make a toast, Kadir? What's that mean, "if you insist"? - Welcome, everyone. - We're happy to be here! I'm sorry we didn't give you a heads-up and barged in. Don't even mention it. [inhales] You can come whenever you'd like to. It's your house too, it's all of ours. [grunts] [boy farts] Son? Are you all full? - Bekir? - [boy farts] Sweet pea, where are you going? [laughs] He's shy. Or he shat himself. [laughing] You should've taken your car. The Mercedes is a guaranteed break-down. It was fine. It brought us all the way here. I take care of it. - It's mine anyway, isn't it? - Of course, yeah. No question. It was gonna be a surprise for Saliha. Is Mom coming with Saliha? Of course, why on earth wouldn't she? Hmm. She's out of the care home then? Are you some kind of idiot? Haven't you been following what's been happening? She's out. The positive cases meant they sent everyone to stay with relatives. Mom's been at Saliha's for two weeks. How'd you miss that? You don't talk to Saliha either? Is something going on with you? No, I'm fine. If it's because the film thing didn't work out, then... What? What's not working out? It's not done yet. It's working fine, it's just not done. It's been two years? How long has it been since you came here to film? It's been two years. How long does it take to make a fucking movie? Stop it. Watch yourself. It's a weird story. - What? - [Yusuf] What your film's about. I heard a little from Saliha. And? I was there, I remember it clearly, too. That day Dad went crazy filming you with his camera. Out by the stable. No clearer memory than that day. That's normal. It really stuck with you. If you really needed to go and... - To go what? - Film a recreation of it for a movie. Of all the stories, the hundreds and thousands of things you could make movies about... I know you just pull it out of your ass. That's the business. But you... You chose that. And it's fascinating. And you settled into the house, on top of all that. You replaced the furniture, redid the paint... Got rid of the couches and fridge... The new guest room could be in a magazine. [Kadir exhales] All that and you haven't touched Dad's room, though. The fridge was broken, it had to go. It wouldn't stay cold. [Yusuf] Right. Well, you did a good job. Really. Looks great. And you converted the stable into your office, too. It must've been expensive. We would've chipped in. - No, I took care of it. - [Yusuf] You did. You did it all. And it looks fantastic. It's nice, kind of like... Like an artist's retreat or something. You did a great job. You made it classy. [breathes heavily] Ever bring women over to the house? You've gotta be careful now though, you know? With corona and everything. [laughs] I wanted to sell it back then. You said you're making your film... So, what now? You live here? You settled in? [footsteps approaching] Well? [woman] Sorry about that. Yusuf, I think Bekir caught a stomach bug. - [Yusuf] What'd he eat? - Everything we set out. [woman] Kadir, don't even ask. You know his appetite. He's seeing a dietician, we'll see how that goes. Hopefully he loses weight. - Hm. - [woman] Hm. Yusuf was heavier at that age, just like his son. Really? Aww... You said it happened when you lost your dad, right Yusuf? That's a tough thing to go through, my love. [sighs] You poor thing! I can't imagine what went on in your head, Yusuf. It was unexpected. We lost him suddenly. He was totally healthy, he took really good care of himself. A country man, not someone... who gets a cold and falls down. He wasn't that type of man. You remember. Don't you? [exhales] - [woman gasps] - [Yusuf gasps] [Kadir cries] [Yusuf grunts] Okay. Oh. [bird chirping] [metal clatters] - Hey. - Here. [sighs] Something's going on. Who knows what? [woman] What? Something's up with Kadir. [breathes heavily] He looks like a caveman. [woman] Should we take a walk today? Just you, me, and the kid. - Yusuf? - [horn honks] Wouldn't it be nice to explore to the forest? Maybe picnic? - Wow, they're really here. - Who? It's gotta be my sister. She must've started the drive last night. - Get dressed, let's go. - Go on, I'll be there. I've gotta get cleaned up first, do my make-up... [sighs] [Naz] Hey, Grandma. [Saliha] We need to catch up! Come on, How've you been? [Naz] Come on, Grandma! [Saliha] Good. What's going on with your beard? [Naz] Hey. - What about me? I want a hug! - [Kadir] Come here. - How are you? - [Naz] Good, you? - [Kadir] Mom? - [Saliha] Mom? [Naz] Grandma? - Grandma? Grandma? - [Saliha] Run. [Yusuf] Sis! - [Naz] Hey, hey! - [Yusuf] Sis! [Saliha] How are you? - [Naz] Come back. - [Yusuf] Good, how are you? [Naz] Where were you going? Come say hello. - [Saliha] You've been well? - [Yusuf] Yeah. [Naz] We're at your house. And look who's here! [air pumping] [woman grunts] [heavy breathing] [grunts] [snoring] [heavy breathing] - You're not coming? - Why would you say that? Yusuf, stop it. What did you mean, "Ask your sister"? What do you want me to ask? Why? - Are you serious? - What? Really, what do you want? What? I asked if you want to have a barbecue. What did you mean, "Ask your sister?" - [door shuts] - Can you explain? [woman] I just thought that... How is your film going? [woman] ...be a good idea? - It's not done yet. - Oh. Why isn't it? Did something go wrong? Hm? Kadir? What's wrong? You're scaring me. Kadir? [inhales] [exhales] I can't finish the movie, Saliha. [inhales] Even the editor quit. [sighs] It'll never be finished. I've been working on it myself, trying to get it done, but... But what? I don't understand. Is something wrong with the footage? [door creaks] [sighs] No. [crying] Shh, Kadir? [fly buzzes] [sighs] [door opens and creaks] [fly buzzes] [fly buzzes louder] There are so many flies. We should get an exterminator. [Havva] Uh, who are you? Oh! Uh... Let me see. Who's that? Who are you, girl? What did you do? - Little girl! What did you do? - Uh, I think she's wet herself. [Havva] What did you do? Huh? Bad girl! [spits] Shame on you! [spits] - Bad girl! - [Saliha] Hey, Mom? - [muttering] - [Saliha] Hey Mom, what's wrong? Huh? You were sleeping so well. What's wrong? Here, let me look at you. Can I see your pants? - Okay! - Okay, Mom, okay. The door's open, see? I'll leave it open, okay? It's open. Come on. Let's take a look. Come on. - [thunder rumbles] - [locks door] [distant crying] [sighs] - Fuck! - [thunder crashes] What are you doing at this hour? To bed, now! What are you staring at? What? [rain pattering] [distant crying continues] [breathes heavily] [sighs] Oh my God! You still have Betamax here? They're trash now. Where'd you learn about Betamax? Well, Uncle, I do actually know some things. [clattering] [drawer closes] Hey, hey, hey, no. What are you doing? Wha... Just looking. Enough looking, then. Don't open that. Hm. Oh! What is it? Your porn collection? [Kedir] Come on now. That's inappropriate and gross. Don't you have any filters, Naz? Tone it down, just a little. There is such a thing as crossing the line. [tuts] I mean, seriously... I don't know if you're gen Z or X or whatever, but there's a line. Sorry. Shake on it? Or should I kiss your hand? Is that what your generation does? Okay, Naz. Drop it. Enough. I have enough going on. [Naz sighs] That's the reason I came. I wanted to know how you're doing. Even I know something's wrong. - Is that really my mom? - [Naz] Not always. She got extra confused coming here, I don't know... We thought it'd be good. Did she really wet herself? [Naz] No. Not this time, at least. She has before. She's sleeping again. [sighs] So how are you? Something's happening with you. You look sick, we can all see it. [exhales deeply] [Naz] What happened to the stuff I filmed? The BTS camera. Uncle? [grunts] It was lost. [Naz] No way, you're joking. I'm not. [inhales] It's gone. When the crew packed up it got lost, or maybe someone stole it. [inhales] It's gone, though. [Naz] No, that sucks. Ugh... I thought maybe we could watch it all together, come on! [Yusuf] We have lots of land and the farm. We're the only owners with 20 decares of land. Hm. Of course Dad, after living in a tiny room for all those years in Germany. If we divide it into sections, each lot can have a house. I say we don't bother. Let's reflect it in the price. Anyone who's buying will understand. No, the price would be too low. We wouldn't sell it for that, I'm just saying let's get an offer. The market skyrocketed from the pandemic. People want to leave the city. What's Mom gonna say about all this? Saliha, I think Mom is... Mhm. "Fuck what my mom has to say." That's not what I'm saying. Does she even know what's going on? Aren't we past that point? She doesn't even recognize me! The house... [sizzling] I won't leave until my film is finished. [Saliha] Why are we trying to rush it? You'll finish in time. And we don't need the money now, we're not desperate. We shouldn't rush it, even if we needed to. [Yusuf] Is that so? I'm glad you're not desperate, but I don't get monthly alimony. Everyone's different and I'm not in your situation. - [Saliha] What's my position, Yusuf? - I don't know. If you don't know then don't comment on it. What alimony? You're an ass. Have you ever asked? Either of you? "How much does Mom's nursing home cost? Is there anything you need from us?" Unbelievable. I don't get alimony. Not for the last five years. What we got was for school. And now we don't get anything from him. He went bankrupt. So we've been on our own. And that's fine. Okay, sorry. I'm asking you now. If things are hard for you, too, isn't that more reason to sell? My work sent everyone home because of the pandemic, but it's only a matter of time before they let people go. These assholes use the pandemic as an excuse to sack everyone. So I need a backup plan. We don't have much left after we pay rent. I need to be saving for the future. Stop dragging your feet. You've been cutting me out for years! If you could calm down for a second... [Yusuf] Sorry Kadir, I can't calm down anymore! I get that we're all different. Consider that we're not like you. I don't get to make movies. I have to pay for my family. I work my ass off. I don't watch life through a camera lens like you do! - Sure, sure, go off. - [Yusuf] That's all you do! That's all you do. Fool around for work, exaggerate stories. Yours aren't even fictional! What do you want from him in his grave? Fuck your stupid film! [gasps] Should I hit you back? Should I smash your face? Do it. Come back. Where are you going? You can't say whatever and run away. I'll be back, don't worry. I have more to say. Stay there. [footsteps fading away] He doesn't make any sense. [sighs] He's so scared. He fights so much with his wife, he's unhappy. He's the only one that can fix it, and I won't let him take it out on us. It's awful. [sighs] Maybe we get an appraisal. Huh, Kadir? Is that Ma? [gasps] You scared me, come on. Mom? What're you doing over there? Mom, why're you lurking in the dark, huh? Come chat with us. Huh! Come here. [sighs] Yeah. What happened? You couldn't sleep? Huh? What's wrong, Mom? Are you cold out here? Should I get a warmer jacket for you? Huh, Mom? Hey, where did it go? Do you have your toy? Could you please show it to Kadir? What do you think, Kadir? Isn't Mom's toy neat? She never lets it out of her sight. It lives in her pocket. No one else can touch it. If you tried, she'd throw a fit. Right, Mom? You're so sweet now. Hey, Mom. Shouldn't you be in bed? You couldn't sleep anymore? Son, what's your name? That's great. I'm Rocky Balboa. Are you making fun of her? Like it matters. - [Saliha] You're better than that, Yusuf. - I guess I might not be. [Havva] You... You... My boy. Look. It's your sister. Hm. Hm. There. You ran to me, and screamed. You ran. Little one. You ran. Can you say when he ran to you? Little one. Uh-huh. Yusuf's the little one. Can you tell us when the little one ran to you? He fell. Yusuf fell down? He fell. [Saliha] Hmm. Yusuf fell down. He got hurt. And he ran to you. Is that it? When he was a kid? Hm. Papa. Papa fell. Papa fell down. Right son? He fell, right? [cries] [Yusuf whimpering] - [Havva] Yusuf? - Papa... Papa fell down. Papa fell down. [sirens wailing] [whistle sounds] [soft crying] [people murmuring quietly] [groaning] [air pumping] [whispering] Please God, help us out. Please. [praying quietly] Okay, that's enough, alright? Amen, amen. Okay. Havva. Don't cry, don't cry. Enough. Shh. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Listen, I'm not gone yet, okay? Don't cry. Don't cry. Wipe your tears, come on. Don't... Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Honestly, I like it. That you'd cry over me. [laughs] Look at me, I want you to listen carefully. It's all up to Allah, isn't it? - Right? - [Havva] Mhm. And there's a chance that I don't leave this place. If that's what comes to be, and they say they want to sell the house and the land one day. The kids, when they grow up. Don't allow it. Or I'll never rest in peace. - Do you hear me? - [Havva] Mhm. Don't let them sell it. 'Cause we built that house with our bare hands. You have to protect it. Understand? You have to be ready. If I'm not there to show you the way, then Allah will be. You'll never be alone. My grandchildren will see what their grandpa made. My grandchildren will see. You understand, right? You understand, right, Havva? I couldn't get enough of our children. And you'll get to see the grandchildren. [soft thud] [drawers rattling] Saliha, honey. - Honey, stop! - Let go, Mom! - Saliha, stop it! Saliha! Don't! - Mom, let go! Leave it! - [screams] - Stop it! Stop! Honey, stop! - Stop! - [Saliha] Leave it, Mom! Don't touch it! - Leave it! - [Havva] That's enough! - Saliha! - Mom, seriously, leave it! Get out of my way right now. Why don't we stay, Mom? Where are we gonna go? What else can we do? We're already just fine here! Mom don't make us leave the house! - I'm begging you! - [Havva] Stop it! [Saliha] Don't make us go! Don't make us go! We can't leave the village! - [Havva] Stop it! [Saliha] Enough! Mom leave it! [Turkish pop music playing inside] [console beeping] - [Turkish pop music playing] - Ah, huh, ah-huh. That's right. Yeah. Should I dip you? [laughs] Wait. Wait. No, like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Huh? - [console beeping] - [footsteps approaching] Ah... Ah... Ah... [air pumping] [laughs] - [laughing] - Look, we're good. - Stop it. - Did I do it wrong? [laughs] Hey, guys. [Yusuf] See? Yeah, like that. - Hey, where you been? - [Saliha] I just took a walk. Wow, what a feast. [exhales] Have you guys seen Naz? She went to sleep, ma'am. Honestly, um, you don't need to call me ma'am. Relax. Call me Saliha, okay? What on Earth are you listening to? Why don't we change it? Of course, of course. You know it shuffles if you leave it. It has a mind of its own. Let's change it, any song in particular? Oh, anything. Maybe a song that's more... [woman] That's more... Uh, more... We could do... What, um... I know a song. Uh... I know a song, so... - [woman] Maybe you should head to bed. - No, hang on! Give it. I know one. My dearest sister asked for a song. Let me put on a song for her. Well, play it already. What's it called again? Hang on... Ha. I found it.

When I spotted it in town, since the guy working on it is my friend, he said he'd finished fixing it up. And I could bring it, so we'd save you a drive. You know, getting all the way there and back. Especially in the pandemic. It's too much, you shouldn't have. [Cemil] It's nothing. Really, don't even mention it. [inhales] I wanted to surprise you, too. [laughs] Are you well? Yes, yes. I thought maybe you'd come. That you'd visit. I waited a while. We've only been here for two weeks. - Ah no, I mean visit your dad. - What? That you might visit the grave site. I thought I'd see you there for sure. I work at the graveyard. I do maintenance and landscaping. Huh. Kadir... He said that you'd definitely come. We visit your father quite a bit. [Saliha] Really? That's nice. Yeah, it is. He visits a lot, doesn't miss it. Now that he's settled, of course. I say all the prayers. He can't remember any. - He's clueless with all that. [laughs] - [Saliha laughs] Some days, I sing a little. Just loud enough that your dad could hear. Since he liked it. [door opens] [Saliha] Yusuf, do you remember Cemil? I don't expect him to. Cemil is my friend. Our friend. Kadir and me, we grew up... [Yusuf] Ah, I see... How are you, Yusuf? Can't complain, glad you're here. I spotted your car in town. It's all fixed and it's running well. I thought I'd drop it off, so I could stop and say hi, too. How will you get back? Oh, I can walk. [Yusuf] No way, it's so far! It's nothing, really. I've made the trip before. You'll stay for a while and have breakfast with us, right, Cemil? Yeah, you have to. Come in. Yeah, come inside. Kadir's in there, he'd want to see you. Look Saliha, with the pandemic... With corona, is that a good Idea? - I have a mask from the mosque but... - We'll be alright, come in, come. We'll distance and open windows, that's all we need. Please come in. Okay then, let me... - It's alright, don't take off... - They're dirty. I don't want to track in mud. And I should... Alright, let's go in. [sighs] One minute, my head's gonna explode. You're an asshole, you know that? What? You played that song last night. [laughs] - [Yusuf] I wanted to surprise you. - Hm. Yeah, I'm sure. No, with the car. I wanted to surprise you with it. So we drove it here. [Saliha] You got me. Well done, I was really surprised. Seeing Cemil come out, too. - Our childhood was alright. - What? It was good, right, Yusuf? I don't know. It was okay. 'Til Dad died. Then it ended. Our childhood. Did you speak with that guy? - The realtor? - [Yusuf tuts] I'll call later. But he has to finish the movie. [door creaks] [breathes heavily] She doesn't recognize me. [Yusuf] She's not well. [Cemil] Yes, Kadir mentioned that. I thought maybe it was the mask making it tougher for her. [Yusuf] Maybe. Aunt Havva, how are you? It's me, Cemil. Osman İşgören's nephew, from town. Nope, nothing. Uh... Aunt Havva? [Saliha] Hey, Mom. - She shouldn't get that close. - [Saliha] Back up, mom. - Saliha... - [Saliha] Hey, Mom. Mom, what's going on? Huh? Mom, listen, we have to leave space right now, okay? Hey, remember what I told you about the virus going around? - [Havva groans] - Come on. What's wrong? Let's go sit down. Come eat some food. Havva, your highness? Come on, Mom, let's sit down. Auntie, do you recognize me? Do you recognize Cemil? Huh, Ma? [cries] You're okay, you're okay! What's wrong? Don't be scared. It's not a stranger, Mom, it's Cemil. Could the mask be what's upsetting her? Do you think I should take it off? No, no, keep your mask on. Don't take it off. It's on, It's on. I probably don't have anything, anyway. I'm outside all day.

We have a lot of memories, Yusuf. It's our whole childhood. With Kadir. With Saliha. Then you all left. And I felt it. I was left all alone here. [exhales] [flicks lighter] - [door opens] - [woman whispering] Pardon. Yusuf? Yusuf? [door shuts] [exhales] [Saliha] I always talk about you, you know. It's been years. And I went to therapy. And I still talk about you. She always tells me, "Mrs. Saliha, [sniffles] you need to forgive her." "You'd never be able to work through it." "It's in your hands. You're an adult of sound mind, you need to forgive her." I am an adult. [scoffs] I feel like a pretty damn bad adult, though. [crying] That girl you grabbed... That you grabbed by the arm and took away... She's crying. She's crying, Mom. Oh, Mom. You took that stone... and you put it right on my heart, Mom. For 30 years. I can't blame you, but I can't forgive you, either. You shouldn't have, Saliha. [sighs] It's nothing. Don't even mention it, really. You said that you live alone. I thought that could be dinner. You won't have to cook. I can cook, you know. I cook quite a bit. I can handle it. I have what I need, luckily. Good. That's wonderful. If you were to come around... I can cook for you. We'll have some goat meat. If it's the season. That sounds lovely. I can't with my Mom. I can't leave her alone. Your brothers could watch her. [exhales] [exhales] You know I went, once. To Ankara. To Ankara when you were there. It was your last year of college. For nursing. Spring... I had a friend that lived there, let me stay for ten days. He showed me around. There's this place called Gölbaşı. It's right next to the lake. We ate food, drank rakı, and I confessed. Probably just because I don't drink very often. I told him about you. I knew where your school was. I said "I want to go knock on Saliha's door." I tried three different times. The first two I chickened out. Hm. Well, the third? You were with friends. You had lots of people with you. Uh, girls, and everyone was dressed up. There were a few cool guys there, too. I saw you having such a good time. Then someone offered cigarettes. You took one and lit it. I stood there and thought, "Wow, she's so cool." "I guess she smokes now." So I lit a cigarette as well. And I sat down. I watched you. We smoked together. When you threw yours away, I did, too. Then you all left for class. I went to the bus station. I caught the first one home. And I quit smoking that day. Why? I knew I'd never enjoy one more than with you. [sighs] I haven't smoked since. I started with you. I quit with you, too. You're always welcome to stop by. Kadir has the address. Give him my regards, I missed him earlier. [exhales] Anyway, take care of yourself. [cries] - [Naz] Uncle. - [screams] Fuck! Naz. You scared the living hell out of me, seriously. What're you doing out here? Naz? Naz, are you okay? Why aren't you saying anything? Does my mom know about it? - What? About... - [Naz] You. What? That my grandpa did that to you. And you got so sick. The film recreated it. I saw the real tapes. In your office. And I watched all of them. The ones grandpa filmed. And? And then he... Then he what? [sniffs] My grandpa died after. I have a question for you. [Kadir] Sure. [Naz] Do you remember telling me it was lost? - What was lost? - [Naz] What I filmed. That the camera had been stolen. That it was lost or stolen and the footage was gone. Is it really gone? Have you seen the footage? I remembered something. Tell me if it's true. Uncle. The camera you gave me, is it really gone? [sniffling] Ah. Ah. [camera beeps] [Naz] Nervous? [tape squeaks] - What're you up to in here? - Where'd that come from? [Naz] Uncle Kadir. I'm filming BTS. It's what he came up with to get rid of me. [tape squeaks] [Havva] A photo would be nice, with my granddaughter. Will you take one for us? [Saliha] It's not that kind of camera. [Havva] Oh, it's not? [Naz] We can get photos from the footage. - Kadir. - [Naz] One second, grandma. - Naz? - [Naz] Take this Mom. Where have you been? - Tell me which button to do. - [Naz] The battery's low. What are you watching? I was looking for you, you know. - [Naz] Come here, grandma. - [Saliha] Oh, wow. It's the BTS. You were able to find it? Wow, look at that! What's going on? Hey. - What's this? - Look! Naz was filming behind the scenes, it was Kadir's idea. Look. Mom looks great. - He might get upset. - Oh, he won't, he won't care. Yeah, play it. We'll be ancient before the movie's done, at least we can see this. [Naz] Check the viewfinder first, so it's not just the wall. Make sure we'll all fit in the picture. - [Saliha] There. - [Naz] Okay. [Havva] I should've worn my glasses. [Naz] Why? You look great, Grandma. [Havva] I should've worn my glasses, like the nurse, the one that... [Saliha] We'll find them. Wow, wow, wow. - [Havva] At the hospital, she was there. - Look at her. [Saliha] Which hospital? [Havva] When your Papa was alive. She's speaking so well. [Havva] There was that nurse. She had this white dress. It was such a bright white. This was two years ago, huh? I guess. [Havva] She was the sweetest. Saliha. Oh, you're the sweetest, right, Grandma? If we could do one with my glasses... - It makes me feel awful. - [Saliha] Let's find them, Mom, right now. - Where's the last place you saw them? - She's right there. She's in her room but it's like she's gone. [Havva] In the great room. They were in the great room. They fell out of my pocket. [Saliha] Why were you looking for them in here? [Havva] It's dark out there, I couldn't find them myself. [Saliha] I'll take a look, okay? [Naz] Hey, she'll be right back. I'm sure she'll find your glasses. Grandma, come back. I'm telling you it's dark out there! That's okay, she'll turn the lights on. I didn't turn them on. Not you, Grandma, my mom. [sighs] - It's 'cause I couldn't sleep. - You couldn't? I had pills from the doctor. Pills? What doctor? - To help the sleeping. - And? Well, I... The pills... I ground them up and added them to the linden tea. Whose tea? Grandma you're scaring me. What're you saying? Since he sprayed him with the hose. Kadir got sick. I put the fire out and opened the windows. If he wasn't drugged, he would've woken up. If he could've met you, he would have loved you. He'd adore you. "The grandkids," he said. "I won't get to see them. You see them for me, Havva." If he didn't drink the tea, he wouldn't have slept through. [button clicks] - [Yusuf sighs] - [Naz crying] Saliha! [groans] Oh! - Kadir! - It's alright. - What is this? - It's alright. For God's sake! What was that? Alright man, alright. Stop. For God's sake! - Okay, you need to stop. - For God's sake. What was that? - Calm down. Okay, stop. - What was that? - Too much, Yusuf. - What was that? I'm asking you to try and breathe, please. - Stop! - Stop. - Let me go. - Please. - What the fuck is this, Kadir? - Please, calm down. What is that? Why? Why? Why, Kadir? It's alright. Mom. Mom. Oh, Mom. Mom. [kisses] Mom. Let's go, Mom. Come on, let's go, Mom. Let's go. We have to. Let's go, Mom. Come on, Mom. Let's just go. Mom, let's go. Come on. Mom. [air pumping] Uh... Hey, what's your name? Huh? Let me see you, girl! What have you done? What have you done? [spits] Bad girl! Sweetie. Sweetie. Sweet nurse, it's you. Sweetie.
