How many have seen "opening the book" before? - (brakes screech) - Close the book. We're not doing that. Here's what we're gonna do.

What is it? What's going on? The sky is falling! The sky is falling! - The sky is falling? - Are you crazy? No, no, no! It's true! Come with me! No. Son? What? It happened under the old oak tree! I'm not making this up. I know it's here. (stammering) There's a piece of the sky somewhere... ...somewhere on the ground here. It was shaped like that! - It looks like a stop sign? - Yes! Only it doesn't say "stop" and it's blue and it has a cloud on it. And it hit me on the head! - It looked like a stop sign. - Wait! What's that? - Son, is this what hit you? - What? Oh, no, Dad. It was definitely a piece of the sky! Piece of the sky. It's OK, everyone! - Dad, no. - There's been, like, a little mistake. It was just an acorn that-that hit my son. A little acorn. - No! Dad, no. - Quiet, son. This is embarrassing enough already. Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'? Why put your town's safety in jeopardy? How could you mistake a stop sign for an acorn? - But it... a big acorn level fluh. - What did he say? - A big acorn level fluh... - (reporter 2) It was a big acorn? - (reporter 3) It was an ape throwing coleslaw? - A big acorn level fluh... (man) Gesundheit! Ladies and gentlemen, it's just gibberish, - gibberish of an insane person. - Come on, Buck! Your kid went and scared us all half to death! Well, what can I tell you, folks, my son, you know... Kids do crazy stuff. You have kids. It's... No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn. It was... it was a piece of the sky. Really, it was. You gotta believe me. (chuckling) A movie. A movie. They're makin' a movie. When? When will everybody forget your big mistake? First it was all over the papers, then they wrote a book about it, then the book on tape, then the board game, the spoons with your face on it... ...the Web site, the commemorative plates. - You saw them, right? - Yeah. I saw them. Can't eat off 'em. - They're not microwave-safe. - You saw the billboards? I saw them. Ha! There's a bumper sticker. I knew it was only a matter of time. Billboards I could live with. Posters I could even live with. But a bumper sticker. It's... it's like glued on forever. It doesn't matter. You know why? Because I've got a plan. Yeah, about that. Well, remember how I told you it would be better for you to lay low, don't call attention to yourself? - Yes, but I... - See, it's like a game. Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, - except the goal is never to be found, ever! - (stammering) Great! (chuckles) Now, we've got a plan, right? I'll see ya later! Remember, lay low. Yeah. OK. Bye. Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken! Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye! That's it.

You have got to stop messing around, and deal with the problem. - OK, yes, but... - Here's the real solution. You and your dad talk-talk-talking... closure! - Closure? - Closure, talking about something until it's resolved. Wait! Hold on! See? Look. There's a whole section about it in this month's Modern Mallard. - Incredibly appropriate! - I told you, I have a plan. Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck, you should "stop the squawk and try the talk." Beautiful Ducklin g says, "Avoiding closure with your parents can cause early molting." - See? Closure. - (sighing) (Abby) Come on, repeat after me. You, your dad, talk-talk... (Chicken Little) Abby, Abby, listen! Talking's a waste of time.

Thank you for talking to me. I'll take care of my son. I... Dad, it wasn't my fault. - It was Foxy. She's always... - All right. It's fine. You don't have to explain anything. Uh... Uh... Hey, Dad? (clears throat) I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I...? What if...? What if I joined the baseball team? (man) Hey, why don't you watch where you're going?! Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry. Baseball? Son, we talked about this. Yeah, right. But, you know, that was when I was small. I put on five ounces this year. I've really bulked up. Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, hey, why not, right? - Yeah, why not, but why? - Well, Dad, you were such a big baseball star in high school. You could give me some pointers. But, son, you know, I'm just wondering... Maybe baseball isn't exactly your thing, you know? Have you considered the chess team or the glee club? And some teenagers, you know, they get quite a rush from stamp collecting. - No. - Wanna stop? We'll get some stamps. - I don't like stamps. - Colors, colorful things... No, I was thinkin' baseball!

That was a... that was a joke. - (chuckles) - (chuckles) Just do me one favor, son. Why, sure, Dad. Anything. Just please try not to get your hopes too high. Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...

Go, Acorns! (gurgling, screaming) (announcer) There's excitement in the air, ladies and gentlemen. It's been two decades since Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals the Spud Valley Taters. Down by only a single run, and with a player in scoring position, we finally have a chance again. This excitement isn't about the fun of baseball, it's not about the prize. It's about the gloating and rubbing their noses in it, the "Nah-nah-na-na-na! We beat you!" taunting, if you will, - that comes with the winning. - Yeah! That's right. Oakey Oaks and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey will finally have bragging rights again for one full year! (chuckling, muttering) But this battle has taken a heavy toll on our hometown heroes. After nine grueling innings and several players out with injuries, the Acorns are scraping the bottom of the roster. Hopefully, there's just enough muscle on the bench to pull out a win. Up next... (shuddering) Chicken Little. - (crowd groaning) - (crying) (announcer) Clearly a long shot, folks. Little hasn't been up to bat once since joining the team. - He's gonna lose the game for us! - (announcer) Wait! If he can just get a walk and advance to first, that powerhouse, Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all. She's had a terrific game so far. A shoo-in for the MVP trophy. OK, kid, listen up. You have an itty-bitty, teeny-tiny strike zone. There's no way he can throw you out! Take the walk. Don't swing. - I have a good feeling... - Look at me. Don't swing. Take the walk. You hear me? Just take the walk! - But, coach, wait! - Don't swing! (announcer) Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold the pine, Little advances to the box. He's going to bat from the right. Make it the left. No, the right. - The right. - Easy out! (announcer) Looks like left field's found something better to do, center field's got a hunger pang in his second stomach - and right field's digging for grubs. - Play ball! (cheetah) Why him? Why now? (sobbing) I won't embarrass you, Dad. Not this time. (announcer) Here's the wind-up, the pitch! It's a high cutter. - Ball! - (grunting) - (gasping) - (groaning) Uh... Strike one! (laughing) I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes. The catcher lays down the signals. Here's the pitch. Curve ball low and outside, he swings! Stee-rike two! Ohh! I said, don't swing! (crowd) Don't swing! - No! - Batter up! (crowd yelling) That's two in the hole! One more strike, it's a punch out, folks, and we're all going home. (whispering) Today is a new day. (slow-motion) Don't swing! - (gasping) - (gasping) Well, take away my squeaky toy! It's a hit! - A hit? - A hit? (crowd) A hit? (announcer) Wait! The batter is unbelievably at home plate. He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run! Go, son! Run! Run! (crowd yelling) Run! (announcer) There he goes, headed the wrong way. - Wait, wait, wait! - No, no! Not that way! - Run the other way! - Turn around! (announcer) Wait! He's turned! I've never said these words before, but he's actually rounding home plate! - Goosey steps on home... - (Chicken Little) Today's a new day! (announcer) We have a tie game! They're scrambling in the alley. Looks like Rodriguez has it. Nope, it's the center fielder! Mayhem in the outfield, as Rodriguez is fired to second. (blubbering) Catch is complete, but where's the ball? Little touches the bag and keeps going. A hunt for the rock. The fielders are having a little trouble. Commotion out there! - It's stuck! It's stuck! - Tip the cow! (announcer) It's the old tip-the-cow play. The kid heads for the hot corner, a stand-up triple! - Yes! - (announcer) Hold up! No! Incredible! He's going for the whole enchilada! The entire ball of wax, the kit and caboodle! Go back! You're never gonna make it! - (mooing) - (announcer) He's trying to lighten his load! The outfield behind, Little's on all cylinders! He slides for the dish! It's going to be a photo finish at home! (gasping) (coughing) (bellows) (umpire) You're out! (gasping) (bubbling) (announcer) Oh, folks. Folks, what a heartbreaker. - (umpire) Wait! - (announcer) Wait! Wait a cotton-picking second. Hold your horses, here, and horses hold your breath.

Get a camera crew! - (bell ringing) - (crowd chattering) (electronic beeping) Chicken Little! You better have a good explanation for this! There's, there's... It's a... You have to... D'oh! Doo wah! What did he say? There's... It's a... You have to... D'oh... Doo wah. Follow me! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here! Aliens here! It's... it's happening again. Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Come on. Come on. You're about to see it! (humming) (gasping) Quick! Quick! It's taking off! Come on! If you don't hurry, you're gonna miss it! Oh, look! A penny! - Guys! - Oh, right. (all yelling) - (chuckling) - Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Quick! It's taking off! Come on! Hurry up! Please! It's right in... (reporter 1) What are we lookin' for? - (reporter 2) I don't know. - (camera lens buzzing) Uh, yeah. OK. I know this looks bad, but there's an invisible spaceship right there with aliens who are here to invade Earth! Let me show you. (grunting) Ooh, bad throw. OK, let me try again. - (all) Bad throw. - We all know I don't have a good arm, but there's these cloaking panels on the bottom. They make it disappear. One fell out of the sky and hit me right on the head. Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again. Eh, there's no story here. At least we can sell the video to Chickens Gone Wild. - I'm telling ya, it was here! - No, wait! There were aliens! It's true! They had eyes... They're glowing and then tentacles! And maps with planets with X's through them! Aah! Runt, that's enough! Don't make Mommy take away your Streisand collection! Mom? You leave Barbra out of this! Why can't you keep that child of yours under control? - What kind of parent are you? - (Chicken Little) I'm telling the truth. Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up! You gotta believe me this time. (exhales) No, son. I don't. (chuckling) I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks. I'm really sorry about this, everyone. Looks like this is just a big, crazy misunderstanding. Well, other than the penny, this whole evening was a wash! Mr. Cluck, don't take it so hard. No one blames you. (gasping, panting) (sniffling, whimpers) - (rustling) - (gasping) (speaking alien language) (panting) (sputtering) (speaking alien language) EMERGENCY, EMERGENCY! SEND HELP! (reporter) Reports of panic and mayhem are pouring in after yet another Chicken Little incident last night. In one instance, a family of lemmings was sent running in fear, but unable to find a cliff, they instead began throwing themselves (phone rings) - from the nearest park bench. - Hello? I'm sorry. Hello? I apologize. Hello? Give me a break! Hello? What? You were trampled? That's terrible. I thought rabbits' feet were supposed to be lucky. (on computer) You have hate mail. I'm truly sorry. That wasn't very funny. (computer) You have more hate mail. Hi. What are you saying, sir? Your hate mail box is full. Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there. Thank goodness the cloud blocked the last letter. Hello? - Hey, hey, hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah? - (woman speaking on phone) Oh, yeah? Well, I'd like to see you try. OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye. - (phone rings) - Hello? Really. Well... (sighs) (rustling) If there was ever a time to talk to your dad... ...it's now. (sighs) It's too late for that. (Runt sobbing) It's too late, baby, now it's too late. (sobbing) Though they really did try to make it. - Runt. - (sobbing) Just think about it. Something inside has died and they just can't hide and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no. (alien sniffling) Runt, I really just want to be alone right now. (sputtering) (sobbing) - (screaming) - Oh! Abby! Runt! Fish! Look! There! Look there! Look there! - What is that thing?! - Look at that! (all screaming) - (gurgles) - (screaming stops) - (gurgling) - (gibberish) - His name is Kirby? - They left him behind? Darth Vader is Luke's father? (Kirby sniffling) No, don't... Come on, come on, don't cry. We're here for you. We're gonna do whatever it takes to get you back home. - Here, blow. - (horn honks) OK. (chuckling) (stammering) See, guys? He's cool. He was just freaked out. That's all. Ah-choo! - (speaks alien language) - (rumbling) (cracking) - (cracking) - (electrical crackling) (tires screeching) (humming) Whoa. Run! (screaming) (Kirby gasping) (speaking alien language) - Those are your parents? - (Fish gurgling) And they brought the galactic armada? (Kirby speaking alien language) - Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him! - There you are. Get in the car. - I gotta tell you something. - What? I know, I know! You were right! Alien invasion. I see that now. - Look up! There it is! - Dad, you know, about that... (chuckling) - It's actually just a rescue mission. - Rescue mission? This alien kid was left and they're coming back to get him! We have to help him, 'cause if we don't, who else will? What?! Ugh! Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway. Son! Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little! Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth! He is! (gasping) Though, given his track record, we understand why you don't believe him!

It's like War of the Worlds out there! - Stop pulling! - Just listen to me for one second! - It's not dangerous! - We are under attack! Will you two stop messing around and deal with the problem? (panting) - You're never there for me! - What? OK, that's not what I had in mind, but... You're never there for me. I mean, you were when I won the game, but not when I thought the sky fell. And not at the ball field and not now! This is good! Keep going. Keep going! You've been ashamed since the acorn thing.

OK, Dad. - Now, all we gotta do is return helpless little Kirby. - (squeaks) (laughing) Return this whatever it is? This is crazy! Crazy! Crazy wonderful!

You have to go to the bathroom? You want juice? A snack? Corn dog on a stick? Want to play some golf? What do you want?! I stink at this. I'm a horrible father. - (Kirby speaks alien language) - No, no, I am. Poo-tee-tah. Oh. Is that your parents? Pooteetah, pooteetah. (sputtering) That's it, Dad! Plan B! All we have to do is weave through traffic through town square while avoiding death rays from alien robots. We get to Town Hall, climb up to the roof and give the kid back to its parents. - (girl screaming) - (crashing) Yeah! Charge! (zapping) Wow!

Oh, Kirby, I'm so happy to see you! My darling! - (sighs) That was close. - At least they're back together. They got their kid. You have violated intergalactic law 90210!

It was just a misunderstanding. (Kirby jabbering) Well, then. This is awkward. - Yes, it is. - I suppose I should... - Put the big guns away? - Yes, yes. - Now put them down. - Of course. - And turn off your big voice. - But I don't... - Turn it off. - But... But I don't get to use the big voice very often! Melvin. Yes, dear. Hi. Uh, anyone want to try the big voice? (Melvin laughing) Again, I cannot tell you how sorry we are for this whole misunderstanding. Oh, dear goodness. We are so very sorry. We are. And if it hadn't been for your son there, well, we might have vaporized the whole planet. - What? - (gasping) Goodness! What a shame that would have been. - Tell 'em! - Where would we pick acorns?

You can't return the panel, can you? - Now that's ridiculous. - You threw away the receipt again. (echoing) Silence! Melvin, did you just try and use the big voice on me? (Melvin) Um... uh...
