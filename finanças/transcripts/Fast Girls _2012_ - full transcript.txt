[STRIVIN' BY TOR CESAY FEATURING SEANIE T] [SONG CONTINUES ON HEADPHONES] Morning, sunshine. How you doing? Yeah, I'm all right. How you doing? All right, Linford? Ready? Whoo! Chop chop. I've got to get back for a delivery. When are you gonna get a new tracksuit? - This is vintage. - It's a relic. - Well, you need new spikes. - I'm broke. Well, nail it on the weekend and you'll have new spikes coming out of your ears. Come on, Linford! Show her how it's done! Go! All right, then, what's that time gonna be on Sunday? - Under 23. - That's right, because then we... - We qualify. - Exactly. World Champs, here we come. Go on, then. Get ready. Okay. On the one! Three, two, one! Pump it! Push into the bend! Good! Bring it home, through the line. - Still half a second off. - Oh, you want more? - I got more. - Well, bloody well do it then. Stop wasting your breath. - You're the boss. - Yes, I bloody well am. Linford! Get out of there! [BARKS] [MEN MURMURING] Hey! Hey, Shania. Come here. Where's that sister of yours, eh? What? You tell me. She lives with you, innit. No, I heard she moved back in with you. - Well, she didn't, so you heard wrong. - Is that right? Yeah, Daze. Look, I don't have time for this, man. If Tara knows what's good for her she will call me. Today, yeah? - You're gonna tell her that. - All right. - Good. - Bye. - Hey, make sure you tell her, yeah? - I'll tell her. [MOBILE RINGING] - Oh sh... - TARA: Don't answer. I swear, if he calls me one more time... - Tara! - Don't start, Shania. I got enough going on. That man is driving me crazy. I swear, if he comes anywhere near me again... Are you gonna turn that shower off? Why have you always got to give me grief? Hi, baby. Hello, Auntie. [SIGHS] Not you, as well? Oh, look, please, just for a couple of days? [SCOFFS] No way. Please, Auntie P. She can stay on the sofa with me and I promise that we won't get in your way. [SIGHING] Fine, fine, fine. Thanks, Auntie. SHANIA: Thanks, Tyrell. Actually, yeah, training was all right today. Yeah, it weren't too bad, thanks. - Ah, there she is. - Good luck today, darling. Don't waste the luck, Mum. It's just for practice. - Oh, right. - DAVID: just because you've already been selected, doesn't mean you don't need the practice - or the luck. - Sorry, Dad. Mum... - Love you. - Nice to see you, Ellie. Hi, Lisa. Hi. Jane wanted to come and support today. Great. How's your mum? Uh, sorry, Jane. It's a family tradition. We always go quiet before a race. It's part of the preparation. Right, darling? [SIGHS] Come on, we're starting in a few minutes. Is that Lisa Temple? Shania, listen. Focus on your own race. - Okay. - She already got her slot. If you run the way I know you can, the last one's yours. - All right? - Yeah. You have as much right to be here as they do. Now you go and show them that. Go on. - All right. Take that for me. All right. - Yeah. [ON PA] MAN: And the next race is the final qualifier for the GB sprint squad. With the World Championships at the end of the summer, Only one place remains. The fastest 200-metre time, sub 23... - Good Luck. - ...will take the spot. Good luck to them all! Quiet, please. [BREATHING HEAVILY] On your marks. Set. [SPECTATORS CHEERING] [HEART PUMPING] Andrews in lane three, up with the leaders. This is a fast opening quarter. - Round the bend. Chapman in the lead. - Yes! Andrews is pressuring. Twenty metres to go! And Andrews takes the lead! - Andrews it is! - [SPECTATORS APPLAUDING] - Shania Andrews made great time there. - [GROANS] She'll take the final place in the GB squad. - Congratulations, Shania... - Yes! On a great rare. - Joining local hero Lisa Temple... - Whoo! - ...at the World Championships. - DAVID: Who's that? MAN: Shania Andrews. Local girl. And has she broken 23 before? She's been building steadily all year. Well, considering she missed last year altogether, I'm impressed. It looks like Lisa's got a rival. That will be good for her. Keep her focussed. [LAUGHING] Take care. Ah, got yourself a winner there. Oh, sorry, Tommy Southern, GB relay coach. Brian Johnson, shopkeeper. Shop... Ah. I thought you were Shania's... Well, I give her a hand, you know. Oh. How do you think she would handle being on the relay team? Why don't you ask her yourself? Shania Andrews, Tommy Southern. - Hi. - Pleased to meet you. Ask me what? I just wanted to say congratulations. You ran a really great race today. - Oh, thank you. - No problem. So, I'm gonna be seeing you at the Valley. Who was that? Am I dreaming? I pinched myself in the changing room. I actually pinched myself, hard. It was a big step for you. You need to keep your times consistent if you want a medal. I beat Lisa Temple in a race today. Did you see my time? Brian, did you time me? Where was your watch? - Are you even listening? - I'm listening but can I scream now? Yeah, go on. [SCREAMS] Whoo! ♪ We're going to the Worlds! Who's going? ♪ - ♪ We're going to the Worlds... ♪ - Well, no, you are. [LAUGHS] What? What do you mean? - You're coming, too. - I ain't coming. My job's done. What? No, listen. Brian, they'll fund you and everything. Look, I promised that I'd help you get in the door and I have. What? Where you're going, you're gonna need more than one bloke and his dog. - Are you serious? - Yes. It's up to you now. SHANIA: Tara? Yeah. Tara, I won. - Did you? - Yeah. Made the national team. I get to train with them, and then I'm going World Champs, everything. - Really? That's heavy. - Yeah. Look, I'm going shop, do you want anything? Uh, no, I'm all right. I did it, Mum. - Shania. - Oh, hi, you all right? - Hi, good to see you again. - Yeah. - How you doing? - Not too bad. You? Come this way. Very well, thank you. Okay, so, our coaching squad will be making sure you hit your targets. And we need to get you kitted out. - Who's your sponsor? - Um, I don't have one. Okay. So, you've got your own kit then? I think we can get you some better spikes than that. - Come with me. - Okay, then. MAN: Stand by. MAN: Knees! Lift those knees! Dropping your shin. Don't drop before... Who's that? Nobody. I'm just gonna speak to this new girl, just go train with the girls. Hello. So, how you feeling? Bit like I'm going to be arrested for trespassing but I'm all right, thank you. How are you? Ah, you know, divorced, stressed, underpaid. Think I found a lump in the shower this morning. [LAUGHS] This isn't about me. This is about you. You're here because you're the third ranked woman in Britain. So how about doubling your chances of a medal? - What do you mean? - Relay. I've got a space on the team and it's yours if you want it. Yeah, I've never really run the relay before. Same principle as the solos - run fast, win race. [BOTH LAUGH] Yeah, I'm just... I'm not very good with teams, though. - Come and meet the girls. Come on. - All right. Hey. What are you guys doing standing around? We're not standing, we're stretching, Coach. Yeah, stretching my arse. Limber up, please. Before you do, I want you to meet Shania... Andrews? - Andrews. - Shania Andrews, this is my relay squad. The fastest girls in Britain. Rachel, long jump, Belle and Sarah, hurdles, Lisa Temple you know, and of course, the legend that is Trix Warren, 100 metres. - You all right? - I'm Carl, team physio. Welcome to the team. TOMMY: Carl will be yours throughout the season. His brutal touch, your reward for being a part of the relay squad. I'll be gentle. So, what, she's joining us, then, Tommy? Well, she broke 23 in Surrey last week. So, I think that's worth an invite, don't you? Yeah, we'll see. Great. Well, we work around everyone's solo events, so there's a relay practice at the end of the week. So, are you up for it? - All right. - Good girl. In the meantime, have fun, bond. Love it. Medals. Let's go. - [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA] - LISA: Carl, can you pass me that? - Welcome. - Thanks. - You all right? - Cool, huh? [EXHALES] I've dreamed about being here my whole life, man. I can't actually believe I'm here. [LAUGHS] Me neither. Um, how about we just start again? I didn't come here to make friends. - Okay? - Fine. - You must be Shania. - Yeah. I hear you haven't got a coach. Why don't you tag along with Lisa and I for the day? Yeah, all right. Okay, girls, I want to practise your block starts. So, we'll run for 10 metres and then we come back and do it again, okay? Watch your hands. Right, it's those first five paces that really count. Heads down, weight forward. On the one. Three, two, one. Good. Nice. Nice, Lisa. Right. Go back, do it again. Really drive those arms, yeah? And on the one. Three, two, one. Hey! Hey, what the hell was that? Come back, do it again. - CARL: Water? - Thanks. SHANIA: Barcelona, man. I've never even been on a plane, so... TRIX: Listen, the Indoors are just a warm-up, girl. Barcelona's big, but it's nothing like the real thing. Look, where do you pay for all this stuff? Don't worry about it, babe. It's all part of the deal. Take as much as you like. Trix is like the mother goose around here. Hey! One kid at home's enough, thanks, Belle. Girls, are we looking at chicken or are we eating chicken? ALL: Mm-mm! SARAH: I'm starving. BELLE: Yeah, I can tell. [EXHALES] Jeez. What is it with you two? Nothing. I just hope we're all as lucky as she was when it comes to the Worlds. I'm looking forward to beating you a second time. [LAUGHS] Oh! Yes, this one can stay! [GIRLS LAUGHING] TOMMY: I want you guys to go through the first set of cones. Take a lane each. We're gonna practise the walking drills. Slow, fast, high knees, okay? You go past me, it's 20 push-ups. Good work! Okay, check marks. Let's go! Mark your lanes, girls. Hey. Simple, all you've gotta do is pass this baton around the track as fast as you can. - Simple, right? - Yeah, simple. Go! Call it Loud and clear. I wanna hear it. SHANIA: Hand! TOMMY: Good Speed! Trix, Lisa, go. TRIX: Hand! TOMMY: Good, Lisa. Belle, Shania, don't take off until she hits her mark. Go! TOMMY: Face forward, Shania! Shania, Shania. Okay, listen, you've got Belle coming at you like a freight train, but you hold until she hits her change-over mark. Then you fly, okay? Okay, go. TRIX: Trust and timing. That's all it's about. Trust and timing. Got it. BELLE: Hand! TOMMY: Come on, come on! I need silk, ladies. Give me silk. Hey, hey, concentrate, come on! - Hand! - Good! Good, Shania. Yes! - You nailed it. Wicked. - Yeah. Wicked. - Good. Now do it again. - [SIGHS] [BOTH LAUGHING] [ALL CHATTING] - Here she is, the golden girl. - Hello there, Mr Temple. Great to see you, Trix. How's the season going? - Going well, thank you. - Good, we want to see you on the podium. You will. Don't worry about it. See you later. Yeah, take care. DAVID: How's it going, Tommy? TOMMY: Yeah, we're getting there. To be honest, if some of the other coaches would give me a little bit more time with the girls then I think we've got a real shot this season. Well, you are the other coach, Tommy. No of fence, but the relay isn't anybody's focus right now. I've asked, I have. All they say is, "If you want a team sport, go and play..." - Football, yeah. Thanks, man. - "...football" Yeah. Dad, did you talk to them? - Yes, yes, I've done it. - Good. [EXHALES] Ms Andrews, hi. I'm David Temple. Look, um... I'm afraid you're not gonna be able to share Lisa's coach. They've built up a routine over the years and with the Worlds only a few months away, it's just too close to disrupt them. - I hope you understand. - Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah. But don't worry. There's plenty of really great coaches here. I'm gonna personally make sure that you get the best one, okay? - Thanks. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wow. Charming, ain't he? All right. Well, I would. [LAUGHS] The man's old enough to be your... My sugar daddy? [GIGGLES] Now, there's an idea. [LAUGHS] You're nasty. [LAUGHS] What? So, what's your story then? Could you stand over there? I started out as a runner, 400 metres. I was a relay reserve in Beijing. Turn around please. Extend that leg towards me. And the other. Okay. So, why'd you stop running? There's a slight curvature. You might have tight quads. Can you face me, please? [CLEARING THROAT] You seem very good at your job. Okay. [SNAPS FINGERS] All done. Strong glutes. Could you take this to Tommy for me please? Oh, yeah. Sure. Good, good, good. Keep that drive, keep that drive, keep that drive! - Come on! Change, change, change. - Stick. Again, watch that hand... [KNOCK ON DOOR] Yep, Yep. [CLEARS THROAT] Carl asked me to give you these. Mmm-hmm. Who are they? USA. The fastest. See how they move as a team. She knows when the stick's coming. That doesn't look like how we do it. That's because they use a downpass. The stick comes in a downward motion. Look, just like... that. Gives you a whole metre of extra distance. Why don't we do it like that? Because it's very risky. Bigger chance of dropping the stick. Yeah, but if it's faster... Look, those girls have been together for years. You see, they have got silk. What we have isn't even polyester. Bye-bye. [WHIMPERS] - Hey, Trix. - Hey. - Good first week? - Um, yeah. It's all right. You know, I don't get it. So, the anchor, the last runner, is meant to be the fastest, right? - Yeah. - So why is Lisa running it? - You're faster than her. - Huh. Well, that's because my daddy was only a maths teacher. What's up, ladies? Doing all right? You lot heard about this fund-raiser on the 15th? No. BELLE: My two favourite kind of people are gonna be there. - TRIX: Mmm. - Fit men and rich men. I'm gonna find myself a cross-breed. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] So what, are we meant to bring a date? [TRIX LAUGHS] You as well? What? I'm just asking. What you laughing at? Hey, I'm married, babe, not blind. Yeah, we saw you looking at Carl with dreamy eyes. - Please! - BELLE: Everybody does. He's got that whole "boy band" look goin' on for him, innit? I'm telling you, if it weren't for them rules, I'd have climbed him like a tree already. - [LAUGHS] - You know what I'm saying? Real talk. Mmm-hmm. What rules are you talking about? No relationships between athletes and staff. It's an automatic sacking of fence. Anyway, the Worlds are more important than that. - Yeah. - And, erm, be careful of Lisa. That girl's been hot on him for years. Please. She's the least of my problems right now. Girl, you're trying way too hard. Like, why you going anyway? Do you really think these rich white people are gonna give you money? Loads of black athletes get funding. Yeah, but they don't look like you. You know, you keep trying to run away but you've got like Primark written all over you. [STRIVIN' BY TOR CESAY FEATURING SEANIE T] [SAMPLE ON TRACK] So you are not who you are in the public arena.

Where's Shania? Does anyone know? [MOBILE RINGING] Sorry, sorry! Sorry I'm late, Tommy. I'm sorry. Whoa! Smells like someone had a good night. Okay, what is going on between you two?

I don't need to tell you what that was, do I? No, actually, you know what? I do. That was shit. You're the fastest runners in Europe, but together, you're awful. - It wasn't all our fault. - TOMMY: Yes, it was. You win as a team, you lose as a team. Shania called too early. She's just not up to it. No, it wasn't just her fault, I was late. Why are you sticking up for her? 'Cause she ain't a stuck-up bitch like you! Shania, shut it! - Oh, so what, it was my fault? - That's not what I said. I'm sorry, I'm not risking my chance of a medal because of her. - Hey, hey, hey! What did I just say? - Are you dumb, Tommy? Her and her daddy call the shots around here, not you! So if that don't want me on the team then fine! Fine. I'm done. I quit. - Shania... - Oh, shut up, Trix! I ain't your little project, yeah? I hate all of you. I'm done. Mature, too. Great. We don't need her. You sure about that? Mmm? Jesus Christ! [DOORS BANGING] Don't give me another injury to worry about. Tough day at the office?

Please, I'm begging you. Look, I'm not gonna force you into anything. If you want to be on your own, then fine. But just hear me out here, okay? That race yesterday, it meant nothing. It was an exhibition. But when we get to the Worlds I'm gonna need you. Now, the 4 x 100 metres is where it's at. Okay? Hey, I told you. I'm not good with teams, innit? Now you know what I mean. [TOMMY SIGHS] Okay. Okay. Whoa! What happened? Your sister. Look at what she and her boyfriend did, letting strangers in our home, - stealing our things. - Was it Daze? Why did I let her stay? Well, look, I'll go and talk to him right now. You do that, but don't come back here. - I'm gonna look after my family now. - What? I've had enough of you both. [BREATHING RAGGEDLY] - No, look, I can... I can help... - No! I don't want you staying here no more, Shania. - Please... - No. Not this time. Just get out. Daze, open the door! Daze! Who the fuck do you think you are? Who do you think you're talking to? Where' s Tara? Look, You know that girl, she could be anywhere, all right? What are you lot doing at my Auntie's? You've nicked stuff, and you break stuff. She's chucked me out. Really? That's bad news, babe. Don't mess about with me, Daze, not today, please. - Tara! - I told you, she ain't here, man, stop this... [GROANS] You know what? Deal with this madness, otherwise I'm gonna slap her. She's chucked me out, Tara! Well, don't go blaming me. What? What's wrong with you? You've got to go and apologise to her or at least - pay for the damages. - Listen, don't tell me what to do, okay? So, what, you're gonna let me stay here? No. Daze don't like guests. - So where am I gonna sleep, Tara? - I don't know. I'm not your mum, am I? Listen, right, it's about time you stopped messing about and took life a bit more seriously. - [SCOFFS] - I got my own life to deal with. - Mum! - In here! - There you are. How'd you get on? - [LISA SIGHS] Silver in the 200 and last in the relay. Congratulations. Congratulations? We came last. But you won the silver. You don't win silver, Mum. It's a consolation for losing. And I know you're gonna say. That that sounds really mean and that I should just look on the bright side and try really hard. - [SIGHS] - Listen, Lisa... he won't reject you, you know. You're still his daughter whether you win or lose. Really? [TRAIN CHUGGING] In you go. [SHANIA MOANS] - What the hell are you doing here? - I got kicked out. - What happened? - It's a long story. Why didn't you call? You could stay at mine. I mean, you can. Thanks, Brian. Come on, get a shower at mine. I'll give you a lift to training. No. No, I ain't going back. I quit the relay and I just want to focus on my solo thing. Come on, I'll put the kettle on. SHANIA: It's pathetic, innit? Sounds to me like you need a good kick up the backside. Thanks... Coach. Coach? Oh, come on, Brian. Please, man. Just until the Worlds. You do love to do things the hard way, don't you? Yeah, you know me. Come on, then. Tea break over. I'll see you out on that track. Yes, Coach. [EXHALES] [SHANIA PANTING] Right. Come on then, back to the shop. No, let's do it again. Come on. Let's do it again. It's no use rubbing that leg. If you're feeling tight we should go back to that physio of yours. - Thought it was just me and you now. - For the training it is. But we don't refuse help when it's there. - I don't really wanna... - I'm not asking, I'm telling. [SHANIA SIGHS] [DOOR OPENING] Hi. Hi. Um, do you have a minute? Uh, yeah. How can I help? Oh, it's just my quads, they're a bit tight. - Hop on, then. - Thanks. Did you change your mind about the relay? No. No, I'm back with my old coach. Just about the 200 metres now. All right. Ah! [INHALES SHARPLY] [GROANS] - Ow, that hurts. - I'd be worried if it didn't. [GROANS] I didn't think this was part of it. I thought you just had to train hard and not eat crisps. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, me neither. I only got into physio after my injury. Before that it was all about the running. Yeah, I'm sorry you can't do that any more. It's all right. - You can run for me. - Oh, thanks. Pressure. Well, you seem to be able to cope with that... well enough. Ha-ha, very funny. CARL: I don't miss the pressure. I'd dream that I was running the race the night before, every time. Hm! I know what you mean. In my dreams I just run faster and faster and it all goes a bit blurry. Why are you running? I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to get somewhere better. Do you know where that is? I thought this was a physical. I didn't ask for therapy. Well, that I'll give you for free. - All done. - Great. Thank you. This place isn't all that bad, you know. You just got to give some of us a chance. What, like you, you mean? [DOOR OPENING] [GIRL CLEARS THROAT] Um, I'm here for my rubdown... Doctor. But I can wait outside. Or watch. [LAUGHS] No, I'm joking. I'll wait. - How long were you standing there? - Long enough. You ain't gonna say nothing, are you? - No. - Thanks. Well, I'm fine, thanks, Shania. Nice of you to ask. Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it? But I guess we've all been focussing on our events. I just... I've been a bitch, ain't I? - More of an ostrich, actually. - What? Sticking your head in the sand then running damn fast in between. [BOTH LAUGHING] You need a break, girl. Just don't get in that zone too early or else you will be loco when the race comes. - Okay. - Trust me. Then what are you suggesting? Hmm. - [WHISPERS] I'll see you Friday. - What? What do you... No, no. If I stick around, you're gonna try and get out of it. I will see you Friday. Yeah? - Friday. - Friday. [CHUCKLES] [MUFFLED DANCE MUSIC] LISA: Is that her?

[SIGHS] I've won every colour of medal in this competition, apart from gold. Or is that even really winning though? Or is it just not quite good enough? Tsh! Sorry, I'm going off on one. It's all right. Yeah, I get it. - I've got to own it next month. - You will. Come on. - What about the drinks? - We're athletes. - We weren't meant to be sitting down. - BOTH: All right! All right!

I like a challenge, innit? - You'll lose, mate. - I don't know the meaning of that word. Yeah, I'm sure there's loads of words you don't know the meaning of, love. Like "deodorant" and "toothpaste". - [GIRLS LAUGH] - BELLE: Just saying. Come on, Lisa, let's go. She's fine where she is. Don't go disrespecting me now.

[ALL CHATTING INDISTINCTLY] Girls, look. Okay. Now I'm sober. - TRIX: Okay. - SHANIA: It's not long now. [SIGHS] Hey. Sure we can't persuade you to do the relay? Oh, no, thanks. Look, I'm a lot more fun when I'm not in the team, innit? - Mmm. - [ALL CHUCKLING] Yes. - BELLE: Home time, girls. - Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go that way.

You look like you're going forever, the amount you've packed. - Bye, Mum. - I'll be there to see you. But don't put too much pressure on yourself, okay? Come on, Ellie, this is what she was made for. I'm always here for you. Regardless. Bye. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Excitement is building for tomorrow as visitors from all over the world pour into the capital for the Athletics World Championships, here in London. Our sports editor sat down with some of Great Britain's top athletes ahead of the event. Golden girl Trix Warren is hoping that third time's a charm. I can feel it through every fibre of my being that I'm ready to go out there and do it. I mean, I've worked hard for this and I think this is the year to go in there and some home with a gleaming medal. PRESENTER: And let's not forget the new girl on the UK sprinting scene. Shania Andrews has made a big impart this year, and controversially quit the 4 X 100 metres relay team after a disastrous performance in Barcelona. I just prefer running on my own. I'm not really used to being in a team. So I think the relay was becoming a bit of.. [SWITCHES OFF TV] [SIGHS] [ALL FALL DOWN BY CAMO & KROOKED] Whoo! Whoo! COMMENTATOR #1: Well, this is it, the World Athletics Championships are here in London, and It's make or break time for all of these athletes. COLIN JACKSON: There's such an amazing vibe here in London. It's great to see a capacity crowd. We're coming to you live from the heart of the capital, and we'll keep track of all Britain's medal hopes. I think It's gonna be an amazing week. We've got big hopes for all our athletes. PRESENTER: Lisa Temple powers her way into the 200 metre final. A magnificent start for Temple, who has big shoes to fill in these World Championships. COMMENTATOR #1: Shania Andrews is right between Harris of the United States and Anderson of Jamaica. - OFFICIAL: Set. - [GUN FIRES] PRESENTER #2: What a run by. - Great Britain's Shania Andrews. - Good girl! Her first World Championships. Absolutely smashing her personal best there. PRESENTER #1: Great Britain's are keeping up with the leaders. At the end of day two. Can they edge ahead in tonight's sprint final? DAVID: ...Focus and concentration from you, okay? This isn't about them, this is about everything that we've worked for. - Yeah. - Okay. Don't let us down, eh? I'll be right back. Smash it. ANNOUNCER: 200 metres final. Introducing the athletes for the woman's 200 metres final. Lane one... COMMENTATOR #1: So here we go, the woman's 200 metre final. We've got two young Britons in there with the world's best. We've got Jill Anderson of Jamaica, Femi of Nigeria, then Temple of Great Britain. The brilliant American, Kelly Harris, she goes in lane four, Andrews in lane five. Then Kolachenko of the Ukraine, and finally a French athlete, Rouberre, out in lane seven. ANNOUNCER: All quiet, please. OFFICIAL: On your marks. COMMENTATOR #1: So, once again, the stadium goes quiet. For this final of the woman's 200 metres. OFFICIAL: Set... [GUN FIRES] - [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] - [CROWD CHEERING] COMMENTATOR #1: Temple and Andrews get away to a brilliant start. They're being pressured by Kelly Harris, United States. [MUTED CHEERING] [CHEERING GROWS LOUDER] [CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY] Harris first Harris takes the gold for America. No medal for Great Britain as Andrews finishes in fourth place, just ahead of Temple in fifth. They'll both be bitterly disappointed with that Shania Andrews, a good time. She placed fourth in 22.19 seconds [BREATHLESSLY] I'm sorry. Don't look weak. It's okay! It's okay, honey! CARL: This is not your fault. It's all about him. He put far too much pressure on you. Shania! Wait here. Shania, wait! [SOBBING] CARL: Shania, wait up! CARL: Shania! JONATHAN EDWARDS: Both girls gave everything. It wasn't enough. When you're up against sprinters like Kelly Harris, I don't think there's much you can do. But there's still hope for our female sprinters. Before we go track-side for the 100 metres final, let's take a quick look at what golden girl Trix Warren had to say about the race. Buzzing. Ready. I can feel it through every fibre of my being. I'm ready to go out there and do it. COMMENTATOR #1: This is the moment that everybody in the stadium, everybody all over the country has been waiting for. Trix Warren goes head to head with the world's very best sprinters. LaToya of the United States and Grant of Jamaica. Could be her main opposition. Can she get the medal she's never won in the past? And now there's a hush around the stadium before the start. OFFICIAL: Set... [GUN FIRES] [INDISTINCT COMMENTARY ON PA] [SCREAMS] PA ANNOUNCER: Trix Warren falls! COMMENTATOR #1: Look at this! Trix Warren has gone down. That is terrible. [CAMERAS CLICKING] LaToya of the United States is gonna win it. Grant of Jamaica second, Jakov in third. What about poor old Trix Warren? This injury that's been blighting her for so many seasons now, has brought to an and her final! World Championship. ANNOUNCER: What a tragic day for this gifted sprinfer. - Lift... - [TRIX GROANS] Trix, believe. You're gonna be fine. - BELLE: just stay strong like you are. - She'll be fine. [TRIX SOBBING] PRESENTER #1: The news from the GB team. Is that Trix Warren's injury puts her out of the games. This injury could spell the end of her career. Let's hope that's not true. [ON TV] MAN: I can only imagine what she's going through... [DOOR OPENING] - I'm gutted for you, man. - Yeah. I'm kinda gutted myself. But it's all right. I got family waiting for me. I've neglected them for far too long. - Yeah, but, Trix, I'm so... - Don't. Everyone is so... So let's just not talk about it, yeah? Sit down. I want to talk about you. - Me? - Yeah. You ran a good final, Shania. I'm serious. You've got what it takes to be one of the best. You just got to start playing the game. - What do you mean? - Relay. - [LAUGHS] OH... - No, I'm serious. - Tommy needs you to take my place. - I can't, man, that girl, seriously... Shania, this is your chance. Don't waste it. All you have to do is run together for less than a minute. Listen, girl, if there's one person you do not say "no" to, it's a cripple that has just blown her last shot at her dream. What, you think I'm guilt tripping you? Hell, yes, I'm guilt tripping you. Promise me you'll go out there and run that relay for me. Okay? Yeah, all right. That's what I'm talking about. - Silk, yeah? - Yeah, man. Silk, whatever. [CHUCKLES] Ready? - Bye. - Bye. You take care. Yeah, you, too. Look after her. - Will do. - See you later. Trix, thanks, yeah? Trix is out, yeah, so I want back on the team. And I won't let you down, promise. I've just run my personal best, so I think I should be back. I've just been talking to Trix and she wants me back on the team. TOMMY: Okay, Shania, you're back on the team. Go. Yes! Thank you, Tommy. Are you tight here? - You ready, Belle? - Mmm-hmm. You got big shoes to fill. This is your time. Now, I know you can do it. So I've put you on the first leg because I know you have that power, okay? - Mmm-hmm? - Yeah. All right, here she is. Let's go. Come on. Okay. Listen up. Semi-final. Let's keep it simple. I don't want anything fancy. And I definitely don't want anything between you two, understand me? ANNOUNCER: Athletes to track, please. Okay. Let's go. Go fast, go fast. Let's do it. - Shania... - Just please, don't talk to me, yeah? ANNOUNCER: This is the woman's 4 X 700 metres relay. The first four places will qualify for the quarter finals. Here are the teams. From Trinidad and Tobago... Proctor, McDonald Cameron COMMENTATOR: This is the first semi-final of the woman's 4 X 100 metre relay, And the big news is that Shania Andrews has come in as a late replacement for the injured Trix Warren. Now that means that Belle Newman moves up to the first leg, Sarah Playaga then Andrews, then Temple. And they've got to be in the first four to make It through to the final. [INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT] But they've got strong opposition, as you can imagine. The Jamaicans are there, too, Trinidad and Tobago, and France. They're all very strong teams indeed. OFFICIAL: On your marks. Set... - [FIRES] - ANNOUNCER: They're off. COMMENTATOR: And away we go. The Jamaicans have got off to a tremendous start here. Jamaica are streaking away for it. Trinidad and Tobago are in contention, but so are Great Britain. Ifs all gonna depend on this first change-over. Hand! And it's smooth. It's good. And there go Trinidad and Tobago, too. A way go Great Britain. They're still in the top three. And here we go, into the second change-over. That's not bad, but Great Britain's seem to have slipped back to fourth place. They'll need to make the next change-over count. One change-over to go. The Jamaicans are in front. Hand! Oh, that looked messy for Great Britain. It's slow. The French move ahead. Temple trying to catch up, but if doesn't look good. Jamaica, Trinidad, Brazil and France. Bad luck, GB. The last change-over cost them dearly. What a shame. Just! One place away from making the final. REPORTER: Belle, a quick word. That couldn't have gone more wrong. Major disappointment. A lot of time, effort and money... - What the hell was that? - You were too slow! - That was your fault. - Yeah, of course it was my fault, 'cause nothing touches the golden girl, does it? Oh, it's not my fault your life is a screw-up! - [CROWD JEERING] - COMMENTATOR: Oh my goodness. The British team's emotions are getting the better of them here. There's a fight on the track between the British three and four, Andrews and Temple. Hardly appropriate behaviour for professional athletes. Oh, flippin'... But wait! I'm hearing a report. - I will sort it out! - There's a penalty against the Fran:♪. The French team have a lane infringment in their final leg. The French have been disqualified Great Britain's are through to the final. Are you joking? It looks like you have a second chance. That's exciting. Great Britain's are bark in if now. - She threw the first punch, Tommy. - I know. I know, David, I saw. Along with thousands of other people. David's right. She's an embarrassment to the team. No, she's our fastest runner. Think about how this looks. We're on the front pages now. Is this gonna make your CV look any better? Sorry, what are you suggesting? It would be a sad end to a not exactly illustrious career. Right. So she's off the team or I'm finished. Is that what you're saying? We're not saying anything. What's your conscience telling you to do? [TOMMY SIGHS] - Is this them or you? - This is me. You're off the team. He made you do it, didn't he? There's nothing I can do. But you can't take this away from me, Tommy, man. What I did was wrong before, and I know I shouldn't have done what I did, but I'm sorry, I... Tommy's decision is final, I'm afraid. We can't let what you did go unpunished. You make us all, the whole sport, look bad. - But I... - Let's not make another scene, okay? Okay. You know what? Lisa's lucky she's got you. [SIGHS] [SHANIA SOBBING] It's a lot different from up here, isn't it? - This seat free? - No. - How about this one? - No, they're all taken. [SIGHS] What you saw between me and Lisa, it was nothing. She was upset after the race. Her dad... [SCOFFS] - Well, you know about her dad. - Yeah, I do. I do, first-hand. Oh, what am I gonna do, Carl? I mean, they don't want me here. They just want me to crawl back to wherever I come from. A smug bastard says you're out and you just give up. - You're really gonna let him do that? - I didn't give up, all right? I was kicked out. Pricks like that can't always get their way. And the Shania I know wouldn't let them. What am I supposed to do? He's not exactly gonna return my calls, is he? Nah, he wouldn't. But I know someone who could persuade him to change his mind. - Lisa. - [SCOFFS] [LAUGHS] Oh, come on, we just... We just scratched each other's eyes out in front of millions of people. Yeah, and you also just qualified for the finals with the worst relay I've ever seen. Now imagine what would happen if you actually ran together as a team. You said it yourself. You always dreamt about running to somewhere better. Well, start there. So go and get your arse back on that track where it belongs. Did you just talk about my arse? I meant your glutes. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS DEEPLY] Yeah, it's worth a shot, innit? Just 'cause I'm listening to you doesn't mean I've forgiven you. Come on. No, you can wait. I've got a race to run. [LAUGHS] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Come in. I thought you'd left. Um... Okay. So, the way I see things, right, me and you got two things in common. Yeah. What are they? One - we both hate each other, and two - we're both fucking fast. - So? - So, I'm saying, if we get our shit together... no one can beat us. Uh, I seem to remember you getting kicked off the team. Yeah, and we both know who's behind that, don't we? Look, I ain't gonna try and pry into your family business or nothing, 'cause I know if you tried that shit with me, I'd rip your head off. But I'm just saying, there does come a time in a girl's life, yeah, where she just needs to stand up for herself and tell her dad to just stick it up his arse. [SCOFFS] Uh, nobody talks about my dad like that. - No, and I'm sorry... - No, it's... It's okay. It's a nice change. [SIGHS] - Is that what you did with your dad? - No. My dad just left. Oh. - Right. Sorry. - No, that's all right. It just means he ain't around to boss me about like your dad. All right then, tomorrow, show me what you got, and we'll see. Why don't we do it now? Um, tracks are all closed. Oh, come on, man. Get your trainers. I know somewhere. - Uh, Shania... - What? Come on. Trust me. - [BATON CLATTERS] - [LISA GROANS] Again. It's late. It's too late. Just like the semi-finals. Just needs marked. Ugh! And again. LISA: Ugh! Too late! - It's never gonna happen. - Yeah, it's all right. It don't matter. We're gonna get this. All right? Shania... We can't get our marks right, but it's irrelevant anyway 'cause you're faster than me. So let's swap it around. What? Fastest runs anchor, right? All right. Sure? Yeah. Hand. Whoo! Jeez! Hand! Boom! Are you sure you're all right with this? - Yeah? - Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Hand! - That was it! That was the one. - That was the one. We've got it. - Yes! - Finally. - Go for gold. - Gold 2011. - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - LISA: Excuse me. Dad? Hello. Can I just talk to you a sec? It's last chance today. You ready? I've looked at the American stats and... - Dad. - Yeah, what? I want Shania back on the team. Yeah, um... Come over here. Is this nerves? No, it's not. We practised last night and we're really good. Don't be ridiculous, Lisa. She's banned. Yes, I know. But she's the fastest. We need her. No, you're faster than her. No. I'm not. She's a liability. She's out of control. - You got Tommy to take her off the team. - You're better off without her. So I'm asking you to put her back on. Darling, I'm just trying to do what's best for you. Yeah, then put her on the team. This is our last chance at a medal. My last chance. Excuse me? It's mine, not yours. Well, if you'd run a better race in the 200, it wouldn't be your last chance, would it? What? That's the reality. You lost. So now we can't have any more distractions or fights. Okay, this is yours. I have spent my whole life trying to please you. This is my time now. Dad, either you bring Shania back or I quit. - What? - No, I mean it. I don't care what you think of me any more. Win or lose, I am running this race on my own terms, not yours. So, how did it go? I can't breathe. - [GASPING] - What? What! Lisa, what did you say, man? [DISTANT CHEERING] COMMENTATOR: Once again, we have a capacity crowd here at the World Championships for what promises to be a fantastic' final for the woman's 4 X 100 metres... - Get me another beer, please, babe. - I'm watching this. - Go get me another drink, man. - The British team facing stiff competition on the track. Can they put their differences aside and bring home a medal? PRESENTER: We're gonna watch four British women bid for world glory. They've had such turmoil during the championship so far. Can they deliver today? COMMENTATOR: it's been a dramatic road to this final for the British team. Fifth in the semi-finals, until the French were disqualified. One more shot, okay? Yeah, we can do this. - Hell, yeah, girl. - Fists in. Oh, okay. Well, you know... I did have a big speech prepared, which you've now ruined. - Had it written on cards and everything. - Aww! Okay, okay. You know what? Just go do it. Just go do it. - ALL: Boom. - GB, come on. Come on, don't screw it up. Oi. What's up? I've never passed the baton in a race before. I've always run anchor. Do you wanna switch? No. I'll be fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. We're good. ANNOUNCER: ...welcome out the teams for the woman's 4 X 100 metres relay. Ukraine, Nigeria... - [CROWD CHEERING] - ...Great Britain, USA... Great Britain's start right next to the favourites, the United States. And, of course, we've got the Ukraine in there, we've got the Jamaicans. We've got the world's very best relay teams. What's she doing on the third leg? She's the anchor. David, sit down. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA] OFFICIAL: On your marks. Set... [GUN FIRES] Well, that's a great start by Great Britain. Newman is absolutely powering around that top bend. Hand! Superb performace by the British. Going into the back straight'. This is the long leg. What a difference a day makes here for Great Britain. They're absolutely flying around the top bend. A great run from Lisa Temple. Coming towards the last change-over now. Hand! [CHEERING] - Come on, Shania! - Run, sis! COMMENTATOR: Heading towards the line. Andrews gaining! It's gonna be close! And it looks like a photo finish! So, so close. I'm not quite sure who won that - the USA, Jamaica, or Great Britain. What a fabulous, fabulous final. It couldn't be closer. - What happened? Did they win? - The stadium is holding its breath now, waiting for the final result. Ifs Great Britain! Whoo! - Yes! - [SCREAMING EXCITEDLY] COMMENTATOR: What a comeback! Have you ever seen anything like that before? The closest final in years. Out of chaos they have pulled off something spectacular. Ifs gold for Great Britain. Darling! - Dad! - Darling! Mum! Mum! [LAUGHING] I love you! [SQUEALS] [SQUEALS EXCITEDLY] [SCREAMS EXCITEDLY] - Come here! - I told you you could do it! [MOUTHING] Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, come on, talk to me. World Champion... - [LAUGHS] It's amaz... - Ah! Oh, my God! We did it together. - We did it! - We did it. - [ALL LAUGH] - Hi, Mum. Whoo! Ah!
