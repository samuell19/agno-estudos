Jeeva is the winner Why taking so long, do it fast. Yeah, I'm doing. It's like your angular face. Make it circular. Good morning, uncle. Come and eat. Hey, I'm here. Since you both are in the same height, I don't know who is who. At night, when you drink ten bottles of beer... ...and eat fifteen bulls eye then why won't your vision change? You don't keep your evil eye on him, He must've been mentally sick yesterday, so he'd have drunk. What? If mentally sick, then he must consume poison. You better consume it. Not beer. Hey, talk anything about me but don't talk about what I drink. There might be illiterates among youngsters. But you can't find one who never booze. Even to those who earn thirty thousand rupees a month, ...it's very difficult to get a bride these days. But every month you borrow thirty thousand rupees and booze. Moreover, you've re-painted an old car and go behind racing, And hanging out with the boys here and cheat on people... Then which loony fellow will give his daughter to get married to you. You... - Me! - Yes... Checkmate. Hey, you... Dear...it's my mom! Hey, then what? He doesn't match our daughter in anyway. When you married his sister, should he not marry his sister's daughter? - Mom! - Get lost. Hey, Shanti! you don't love me? Get lost, you pig faced. Why do you utter your dad's name for that? Wastrel. Hey, shall I drop you? Hi! Hey, the flavour of mint leaf is awesome. Mint leaf! Wait, I'm coming. How do you know that? Jeeva, you eat only after we have. Did I eat the last! Okay, where are all the guys? Ganesh went to buy milk. Shiva is playing cricket. Then what, Jeeva. Our guys have grown up. Have they grown up! I don't understand. What do people in this flat think of us? They'll think we are hanging out with a lunatic. Leave him. Yeah, you're right. Jeeva, we are here for a long time. You come out, let me tell you one thing. Come, I'll tell. -About what! He is dead! I've to buy an important thing from the medical store. Hey, won't you buy on your own? This place and the shop-keeper are familiar to me. So will you go and buy? - Please. - Okay, I will. But will you buy me beer tonight? - Certainly, I'll get you. - Give me the money. Take it. Brother, give me a condom. Okay. She is unmarried What? Won't you wrap it and give? Sir, what kind of condom you need, special or normal? Uncle... uncle. Hey, uncle. Hey, what kind of condom you need, special or normal? You sinner! Hey, why are you shouting? Instead I'd have come there. Nothing is required, come. Checkmate. Thank you! Very nice Brother. Someone has come to see you. Greetings, sir! Hi, sir. This is my sister Anandhi. She is a transgender. You go inside. She is going! He is the one who spoke to you on phone. - Hello, sir. - Nice to meet you, sir. How this is possible? I couldn't believe this. I'm so excited about it. Everything depends on hope, sir. From now on, you'll start believing me. Yeah, when are we going to see? It's not in my hands. There are lot of mysteries around us in this world. We can feel a few of them and even we can see. But certain things are beyond our control. That is called "Myth". All these myths were found by our ancestors, the Siddhars... ...and transformed to manuscripts and kept secretly in Tiruvannamalai. Having one of the secret manuscript, We have ventured into this. Have you been to Thirunallar Temple near Kumbakonam? The temple has a unique feature. A satellite which crosses the temple tomb will lose it's function for thirty seconds. How is this possible? NASA is still doing research on this. Our planning is also similar to that. Not only that, What is the center point of this world... All the scientists of this world have done research and discovered it. It has been confirmed the world's center point exists in Asia. Asia means here, in India. Where in India? In South India. Where in South India? In Tamilnadu. Where in Tamilnadu? In Chidambaram. It's Chidambaram Nataraja temple. The big toe in the statue of Lord Nataraja... is discovered as the world's center point. We have evidence for floral flying chariot that existed five thousand years ago. But the drone we're about to build now will look normal. But this can easily capture military secrets. No one can track this drone. Whereas, we can find wherever nuclear weapons are made in this world. We can use it for ourselves if needed. What I'm going to say now is going to set a new record in this world. Through this we're going to get many crores of money. But all I need from that is just a hundred crores. Don't worry, darling. If you need hundred crore rupees immediately, then the only source is Abu. If you ask him, you'll definitely get it. He's the worst, but we have no other choice. I know both of you work with Abu for past ten years. I'll give fifty lakhs for each of you. Leave to Hong Kong and stay happily. I'll take care of your family. When you return, everything will be fine. What's your call? Stop! Hey, stop! Are you new? What are you doing? Abu doesn't like harassing women, don't you know that? All we need is her husband, Come, let's go. Consider he is dead. Abu, I made a mistake unknowingly. Please, forgive me! Abu, please forgive me! Abu! Abu! Abu, please! Abu! Abu, don't! Please, leave me. I made a mistake unknowingly. Abu! Abu, we got a litigation property for business. It's enough, if we get it transferred. We'll get double the profit. Even the minister is supporting us. - So, all the legal matters... - Shut up. How much do you want? Hundred crores. When will you return the money? Within a week. How to trust? Abu, we have come with hope on you. Fine, you've come with hope on me. But how can I trust you? What if you don't return in a week? Oh, no! There is no chance to miss it, Abu. - Trust us. - Sure, shot up. May God be with you. Our work is done All this money is for you and even the car. Bye, sir. (Chanting Mantra) Jeeva, for hosting treat either jewelry or money is required. Instead you've brought a dog? Hey, this isn't a dog, it's a conjuring devil. The moment it came to our house, Since then, my uncle treats me like a dog. Okay Jeeva, what are you going to do now? Let's take a photo of it and post it on OLX, It can be sold within an hour. Then today's treat is confirmed. Let's eat KFC chicken. Dude, great! First let's take a photo of it... ...and post it on OLX. Smile... smile. - What? - Look there, dude. Wow...she looks awesome, isn't it? She is my girlfriend. - Hi. - Hi! Come over. Come. Just a minute, I'll come. Hey Jeeva, having her as a girlfriend will be great, right? How dare you...? Welcome! - Hi. - Hi. Male or female? It's a male. I asked about the dog. I was just kidding you. It's a female. - So cute! - Thank you. I have just moved to B3 flat on the second floor. How about you? I'm at the first floor, A4 flat. Can you tell me your cell phone number? Yeah, sure. 98422 39... Cross talk. It's China made, very cheap. Take my number, it's iPhone. 98840 88008. - I'll call you. - Oh, sure. Okay, bye. Incoming call free for me. - See you. - Bye. Bye. Didn't I tell you, she is my girlfriend? She is taking my contact number on the pretext of seeing the puppy. With this dog, I'll lift that beauty. - Then KFC canceled. - Yeah. Jeeva, you're not worth it. Whenever a new girl comes to school, college or locale... ...immediately someone will say she is his girlfriend. If a beautiful girl is there, boys will surely roam around her. Who she likes is her boyfriend. Till then, she is common to all. No more talking with you all. Come, let's go home, puppy. If you think how do anyone know... and read books on intimacy or have intimacy, Then it's not about cheating us, it's like cheating yourself and your life. So, what I would like to say... Dear, don't change the channel. You must watch this. Better watch. Hey, shut up. - He speaks stupidly. - Not more than you, better watch. Hey, check who has come? Go... Should someone come at this moment? Hello, Aunty! Aunty? I have just moved to B3 flat upstairs. Jeeva told me, come inside. Dear, they've just moved to the third floor. So nice, please sit down. You move away and sit. Hey, you shut up. You better wipe your mouth. What would you like to have, tea or coffee? It's okay. No need, thank you. What's that you're hesitating? Do you need anything? That's personal... Personal! Women's issue. No problem, you tell... You want me to go? Hmm. - Go. - She is killing me. What's personal? Where is your puppy? Puppy is inside. What's personal about puppy? No aunty, actually... She too has a pug dog. That's a male dog. This is a female... Okay... okay. So you've come seeking for a bride? - Exactly. - It's okay. Can we see the puppy, aunty? - It's there in the room, go see. - That room? I'll go see. Hi, puppy. Hi puppy, come here baby. Good girl, come here. Come here. Come here, baby. Come here. Come. Puppy, come here. Hey, where are you going! Dear, where are you going? Come here. Puppy, why aren't you coming to me? Come, my dear. Baby... Puppy. Oh, no! What happened? Puppy is soft natured. Oh! You won't have any problem. Did you see? What? - What happened? - Shailu! Don't you like? Aunty, I'll see you later. (Chanting Mantra) Mr.Ramanujan, when are we all going to see it together? You need not worry about it. Because he has to take us inside cautiously. And he has to bring us back. And one more thing... The whole of this tough journey we are going is illegal. So, on the way we need to cross rivers, mountains and forests. Only at the end, we can take that object. Above all, we should have the grace of God. Then, we'll be able to get that object. Shall we move? - Hey, Jeeva. - Yes. Jeeva. - Come here. - Coming. The two girls from upstairs came here and enquired about our puppy. I told her to go see inside. But later she left as if she saw something weird. You do one thing. Go, give puppy to them. Why should we give our puppy to them? That is...hey it's for a reason. You don't know, they know it. You go, give puppy to them. Okay. Careful, tell them to handle carefully. Okay. Take it and leave. Come on. Have you come? Who's dog is this? This is my dog. Then why did my sister ask me to give our dog to you? First, come out. Hey... What are you doing! Hey! What are you doing! Why did you leave both the dogs inside? Oh, no! Hello...hello... Wait, now I understand. How do you understand the dog's feelings? Because, it's a male dog. Does that mean you understand a man's feelings better? Oh, gosh! he is irritating. What did you say? Shall we have coffee? Coffee! Why not? Come, let's go. It's very hot Sir, still how far do we need to go like this? Still we have to walk two miles into the forest. Then we'll reach the mountains where the siddhas lived. That's where the object is. - Come. - This way? Be calm and come, Ganesh. Follow me and come fast. Okay, explain us sir. What you're witnessing isn't an ordinary 'Damaru'. Lights! It's nothing but Spice dead. Sir, what an amazing power! If we come close to it, sound and light will be disconnected. - Did you see? - Excellent, sir! It's okay if it got fused but it was blasted. Now I'm going to prove my next level. I mean, the sound energy. If I throw a bundle of crackers from there, it'll come inside loud. But when it reach here just observe what happens to the sound. - Okay. - Will the fire stop? Throw it. I'm absconding with hundred crore rupees!!! It'll take many more hours for you all to cross this forest and go out. By then, I'll flee to where no one can reach me. I have inquired well. There is no such project in India. Even in America and Europe, they're in first level of research. They planned well and deceived us. - Not attending. - Call the landline. Hello! It's me speaking. Abu! He has gone to Bangkok with regard to your work. Funds will be transferred in a week. Definitely he will settle. It's 5 o'clock now in my house. Five more minutes to five at your home. Look to your right, your pet cat is eating pedigree. To your left, your Varsha is dancing well, isn't it? Won't you dress up properly if you're at home? You're standing with inner wear? Give him the phone who is sitting in front of you, looking at everything. Abu, I'll definitely return your money in a week. I'd have believed if you had picked up the phone yourself and told me this. We are all got trapped by Abu. Sir, we have only one option. Let's go and tell everything to AC Veluswamy. We don't have other option. Sorry, Sarath sir. Now everything is in your hands. So you trusted him and got abandoned. From where did you get such a huge amount? Abu. Abu! I can't help you in this game. Don't depend on me. Sir, please help for my sake. Please! Alright. Okay. Speak to Abu as I said. Oh, no! I'll go and sit in the car. Hey, don't be afraid better come. I left the bag in the car. We'll take it later, Come, let's go. This is very normal here, come. Hey, come. Come This way? Go inside. Look there! That's Abu's mistress. Is it! I don't know. What does mistress mean? She is the third woman he is going to marry. His wife's younger sister. No, I didn't see. I checked after she said. Very surprised. Oh.. Abu, I made a mistake. Please, forgive me. I'll return your money before the election. If I don't settle the money, do as you wish. Shut up. I know what you did and how you lost the money. When I'm able to tell you what's happening in your house, Don't I know where you lost the money? Converting black money to white, getting thousand crores in the trust account, Lending money to satellite. For all these deceptive business, only mediator will be there. It has no seller and no buyer. There will only be cheaters like you. Everything you say is true. He didn't say he'd not return the money. He is asking for a week time. He'll definitely return the money. I'll be responsible for returning the money. I'll give you one week time. If you don't return the money... May God be with you. Come Sarath. Let's go. Don't worry. I have an idea. The Reserve Bank of India has issued an announcement for new 5,000 rupees note. With the completion of the design and printing for 5,000 rupees, no release date is specified. Bhai, how are you doing? By grace of God. I'm doing good. Do you know, five hundred rupees notes will not be valid. Thousand rupees notes will not be valid. Even the two thousand rupees notes will not be valid. Most likely, five thousand rupees notes will be launched. Very soon... May God be with you. Why have you brought us to the sea? All for a reason. Abu will do what he said. As committed, we must return the money on time. Don't know what to do to get such huge money. But certainly must do something. So, what's the point? There is a house behind us, right? Don't look back immediately. Okay. It's the house of a Minister. It's said in news that 5,000 rupees notes were coming. He has converted all the black money he has... ...into five thousand rupees notes and kept secretly in this house. If we break into the house and rob, He cannot lodge a complaint legally. We can loot the money tomorrow night. After settling the money to Abu, we can take the rest. It's my responsibility to create riots in the city tomorrow... and to divert the cops. 'I have been waiting for this moment.' Don't go around with blind hope that we will win. For past ten years, we haven't done any good for these people to win now. Let's invest money and show our power to prove who we are. This time we must win, no one can win over us. Today morning at 10.30, When former Union Minister Neelamegham, ...Was in meeting with party officials in his constituency, He was stabbed to death by unidentified people. So a tense situation prevails throughout South Tamilnadu. His party cadres have been involved... in violence across Tamilnadu. His party accuses the current Union Minister... Peter Alwa as the reason for the murder. His effigies were burnt at the stake. It's suspected that this may be due to the enmity... they had for the last ten years.
