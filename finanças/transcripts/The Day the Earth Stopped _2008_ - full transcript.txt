No just with ourselves, but with the entire universe. They returned to their planet, leaving us here to pick up the pieces. Families were reunited. Our cities rebuilt. Somehow, every night, my eyes search the stars wondering where she might be in one of them. We learned the value of peace. Just as the memory of her face would fade, so would the warning that she had brought with her. Our world once divided, learned to hope...together. But I knew, they would be watching. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
