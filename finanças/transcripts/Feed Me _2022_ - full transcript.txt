Anybody home? Hey, it's me. Look, I know you just wanted some space, but don't you think this has just gone on too far? (Knocking) Mrs Freeman? It's the Police. We're just here to check if you're OK, madame. I am so sorry about how I left things the other night. I didn't mean for those things to come out the way they did, but they... They just did. Sarge. CAD 9619, foul odour coming from inside of the property. We're gonna be putting this door in under section 17, if you can update the CAD please? (Radio) Received. Go ahead. We can get through it together, we've done it before and we can do it again. Please, I am begging you, Liv. Just let me in. (Door breaks) Oh, Jesus (Coughing) (Answer machine) Last month, I wish I'd just given you the biggest hug and told you that everything was gonna be alright. What I would do to just... hold you again. (Coughing) (Answer machine) I don't wanna be separated anymore. (Answer machine) And I know that you're not answering my calls right now, but... (Answer machine) I'm gonna swing by tomorrow morning, and then... (Answer machine) All I ask is that just you and me can talk in person. Please, Liv, I am begging you. Nothing makes sense anymore. (Answer machine) It's just dull. (Officer coughs) (Answer machine) And you are the love of my life I'll see you tomorrow. Hopefully. I love you. (Flies buzzing) (The Officers cough and gag) (Loud knocking) (Loud knocking) (Somber music) Thank you all for coming today. I know Liv would be... ...astonished just to see this many people in one room for her. And I take it you all... ...Understood, in some way. The more you knew Liv, the more she would push you away. You're not hungry? I ate something before. -Please, Liv, let's just not do this. -I'm not hungry. If you just let me come home. Jed, we spoke about that. Please. -But you were doing so well. If I just... -STOP IT! -I said we'd spoken about that, OK? -I'm trying to help you here. Just help yourself. I'm fine. You're not fine, Liv. I need more time. I'm sorry. Every day that we had together, I would see... happiness kindness. Beauty. But when she looked in the mirror she would see something... ...Something different. She would say to me "How can you love something so ugly?" And she would judge me for loving her. I tried so hard to fix her. I tried so fucking hard! (Scuffling) Hey, buddy. Can I get you a drink? Who are you? Lionel Flack. Entrepreneur and confidant of many. A man of many talents. Friends call me Lie. See, uh where I'm from, a couple of blocks away was this, uh discount store. Sold all sorts of shit. But the only glasses they ever sold were these, uh cheap champagne flutes which was convenient though because my Momma, God rest her soul, had a love / hate relationship with champagne of all things. Now, here's the interesting part. Your average cup- -Average cup? Highball, Demitasse, Collins glass. Whatever. I realised that nothing fulfils or quenches ones thirst the same way as a champagne flute does. Whatever the beverage. Fruit juices in particular, especially when chilled. (Lionel chuckles) (Gulping) (He gasps) By the way that eulogy, Oscar worthy, truly. I admire that. What is it that you want, Lionel? Firstly, to explain myself. You see, I'm an avid fan of obituaries. I read them every day. I started going to funerals and it's there that I found my peace. -You should try it sometime. -Thanks, but I've got other plans. Such as? Well, let's just say life didn't deal me the greatest hand. You know, I've played my cards and I am done. Thanks for the drink. (Ominous music) All that weight you're carrying, what if I said I could take it all away? All of it. Nice meeting you, Lionel. (Jed sobbing) This afternoon, at lunch. I never asked how you were. So, how are you? I'm fine. Are you ok? No. Please just talk to me. Like you could understand. Are you mad? You know exactly what I went through with my dad, so don't tell me that I don't understand people like you. People like me? Yes. Damaged, silently screaming out for help, knowing full well that the people who can actually help you can't do a fucking thing. And why is that? Because you won't let them! And we do the same old dance, over and over and over again until eventually you'll keel over and fucking die. You keel over and die. I want you gone. As you wish. (Sobbing) Oh, fucking, God. (Sobbing) Hey... (Lionel chewing loudly) Is this Lionel? (Chewing continues) Yeah. Its, erm. It's Jed, from the pub. (Lionel chuckles) What can I do for you, Jed? God, I don't even know why I'm calling. I... Erm- -I think you know exactly why you're calling me, Jed. Will you help me? Do you know what I do, Jed? Assisted suicide. Jed Listen to me. You're a good man. But when you see her again, and you will see her again, you have got to radiate happiness, brother. Now, I promise you that by the end of our journey, you'll be lying in a state of total bliss, with so much unconditional love for yourself that you'll be laughing all the way to the pearly white gates. Just tell me how it works. Well, how did she die? It was a... An eating disorder. Bulimia most of her life. Her stomach ruptured she blacked out, and her heart just... ...stopped. She starved herself to death and... ...she was eaten from the inside out. How about the outside in? What do you mean? Jed, have you heard of the Yiurkun tribe? They are a collective of enlightened individuals that bask in a state of permanent euphoria. Now, this is achieved by way of consensual human consumption. A direct connection with the universe, Herself. Wait, wait, wait. So what are you saying?- -It just so happens, Jed, that I share the same taste for both She and my fellow man. So... you wanna eat me? That is exactly what I'm saying. That is sacrifice, Jed. That is selflessness. That, my friend, is the most heroic end of one chapter before the next begins. It's wonderfully poetic, is it not? It's a lot to take in. Well, hows about I let you sleep on it, Jed? And when you decide to proceed, I'll be back at Graham's Bar from 6pm tomorrow. (Phone slams down) (Erupting applause) (Flies buzzing) I'm not hungry. (Phone ringing) Yeah? (Jed) I'll do it. (Jed) I'm in. (Gentle rain pattering) No ducks here. Sorry, what? Uh, this pond has no ducks. Oh no, I know. I'm here for the fish. I know, sounds crazy, right? I'm Alex. Oops! Sorry. (Laughs nervously) Lionel. So, do you have any of your own? Erm, no. Too high maintenance for me. They are literally the most low maintenance pet one could have. Fresh water fish are the largest proportion of pets owned across the US. And they are proven to lower blood pressure and heart rate. Thus, relieving stress for maintaining a better quality of life. You do this for a living, you sell them? No. I'm just saying they're good for maintaining equilibrium, is all. So, you think I'm unbalanced? Do you think you're unbalanced? (Alex laughs) Do you know what? I'll make you a deal. I'll give you a chance to convince me to get one of those tank thingies, if you pop by and try my signature cappuccino? You know what? You have yourself a deal. But I have some business now I need to attend to today though, so. Wait! Have you got a number I can call you on? That's me. I gotta run though. Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you too Lionel... ...Flack. (Alex chuckles) Howdy, brother. I was not expecting you for another thirteen minutes. Well, in the spirit of turning the page. Jed, over the course of our time together, my job is to make sure you are happy. And at any point you're in pain or in discomfort, you just need to let me know. So, do you eat normal food or just- Kettle corn. Here you go guys. You ready to order? Thank you very much but he's not hungry. The bill, please. Have a read of that and sign and date at the bottom. I trust you Jed, but I need your full consent. "Termination and disposal upon breach of contract?" If you change your mind, Jed, I need to protect myself. I want you gone. L'Chaim! L'CHAIM! Welcome to the afterlife, brother. Now, let's get you reunited with that smoking hot wife of yours. Cell phone, please. Would you, uh. Would you mind? Casa del Lie! Step one for a pain-free first procedure. Drink. OK. Attaboy. Living room. Bermuda. Huh? My fish, Bermuda. Do you live alone? Yep. What's through there? Storage. Theres... There's that. Right. Now, uh. Put this on, freshen up and meet me back in the living room. Oh, and have an amuse bouche. (Crunching) You take photos? Yessiree bob. Big time hobby of mine alongside the day job. Check it out. See, when my step daddy left, my Momma encouraged me to pursue photography. She always said I was the artist of the family. And I guess I found myself walking down the old, uh, life modeling road, and You know, I kind of had a knack for erotica and abstract exoticism, really. So, who is she? My Momma. (Jed gasps) (Wretching) I'm so sorry! That's fine, erm. He'll be fine. You can clean that out in the morning for me, Jed. Take a seat. (Jed groans) Careful of that one, she's loose. Bare with me, Jed. Step two. What's step three? Step three... OK. What are you doing? What's best. What's that now? Nothing. There we go. How does that feel? I can't feel a thing. Good. You ready? (Bones crunching) (Jed gasps) (Hissing) (Jed shrieks) (Sizzling) How do you feel? Lighter. Attaboy. Proud of you. Well, I think that's it for this evening. I'm beat! Huh? Sweet dreams, pal. (Sobbing) (Wretching) Lionel? Lionel? Hey! Come in. Fuck! I don't eat... . milk. It's almond. Mmm. Sorry, buddy. Can I ask you something? Sure. What would you do if you found out that somebody wanted to leave before they were supposed to? I don't know, to be honest. I've always been really good to my employees. I guess you'd call it a breach of notice. Or a breach of contract. Hmm. What's wrong, Lionel? Hm? Well, it's my roommate. We're friends, and last night we took it to the next level. And after that, I'd definitely say that we're closer. So there's this undeniable level of spiritual trust and understanding, you see? And I worked so hard to get him to bare his soul to me, and I reciprocated. And after all that was done, we went to bed. And in the morning, I got up and found out that the son of a bitch had almost left me in the middle of the goddamn night! What? I think you should speak to him. Tell him how you really feel. Yeah. You know what? I think I will. Hey, Lionel! Don't be ashamed of what you are. We all like what we like. Hmm. Oh, hey. I don't suppose you want a selection of lamps, do you? Erm, no. (Lionel scoffs) Lionel? Fuck! What's that now? Just erm, checking on Bermuna. Bermuda. Have a seat, Jed. OK. Hold on, hold on. Here. Kettle corn. Look, I just felt bad and I just wanted to let you know that I'm sorry, OK? And I am sorry. I just hope you know that I didn't mean to upset you, Lionel- -LIE. -I just. I feel terrible! -Jed. This is not the way, buddy. What happened? Honestly, I just thought all of this would have gone down a lot... quicker. I kind of just want it over with now. Well, (Clears throat) in the spirit of speading things up, Go ahead, lay out your arm. Two more days, tops. OK? Are you ready? No! Yes. Whoa whoa whoa, STOP, STOP, FUCK! STOP, STOP, STOP, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO FUCKING HURT! FUCK! (Screaming) FUCK! LIONEL, STOP IT! WHAT'S THAT NOW? FUCK! (Jed shrieks) FUCK, LIONEL. STOP! I CAN'T STOP, JED! I NEED TO REMOVE THE ARM TO CAUTERIZE IT! (Screaming) CAD 7842. Mr Lionel Flack. Triple one alpha Quilter House. Sierra, echo, two, five, one, hotel, zulu. A Mrs Mary Huggins reported screams coming from within the property. Yeah, received and en route. (Jed screams) OH, GOD! FUCK, LIONEL. STOP! (Screaming) TAKE YOUR PILLS, YOU SHIT. HOLD ON, JED! (Jed whimpering) (Jed shrieks) Drink this. Drink this. Drink that, buddy. There you are. Got some more, here you are. Yeah, buddy. I NEED TO FINISH, JED! (Screaming) NEARLY THERE! FUCK! PLEASE HURRY THE FUCK UP! I'M ALMOST THERE, YOU SHIT! PLEASE! (Flesh tearing) OH, GOD! FUCK! STOP! STOP! STOP! HURRY THE FUCK UP! PLEASE! (Lionel panting) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY! (Hissing) That's my boy. That's my baby! (Lionel chuckles) You're gonna be one crispy little piece of shit. Mmm. (British accent) Well, fuck me, you taste great. You are what you eat, Jed. We're top of the food chain. And if we are what we eat, then why would we want to be anything less than human? And I want that reflection. (He whimpers) (Knocking) Hello, this is the Police. Can you open up please? Are you Mr Lionel Flack, sir? Come again? Are you Lionel Flack? Yes ma'am. What can I do for you? Would you mind if we come in for a moment? Erm. Sure. Come on in. What's this all about, officers? We are sorry to be bothering you so late, sir, but we've been anonymously alerted of a cause for concern regarding a noise complaint. Well, look at me. I'm fine. No cause for concern here. Do you live alone, Mr Flack? Sorry? Do you live alone? Yes ma'am, I do. So there's nobody else here that can account for the reported screaming? Screaming? Listen... if you're anonymous call came from downstairs, then I can tell you now that she has had it in for me since day one. Everything is fine, and as it happens, Everything is fine, and as it happens, I was about to turn in for the night. But I did watch a movie earlier and I'm hard of hearing, see? So, that's probably what it was. Fair enough. Well, if we can just keep the noise down and we can keep the peace, yeah? Absolutely, ma'am. Can I use your loo? -What's that now? -The bathroom. Uh Sure. Yeah. Last door on the right. So, you're American, huh? Yessir, born and raised. Texas? I travelled around a lot. I thought you said you were going to bed? I am and this is my home... and I can clean up whenever I see fit, thank you Mr kind officer, sir. What is it? That is a mild veal, with a raspberry coulis, straight from the Captain's quarters of the Cutty Sark. (Laughing nervously) Fuck me, come on, Sarge. This is the best veal I have ever tasted. No, honestly, you have to try it. You have to. This is not veal. This is Michelin Star veal. What do you do, Mr Flake, are you a chef? It's 'Flack'. and I own a boating company. You're in the wrong profession, mate. Duly noted. Thank you for your time, love. Apologies for the... Well, disturbing your evening and... Yep (giggles). That's really good. Let me get that for you. All the best, mate. You take care, now. Aww, you too Mr Flack- (Door slams) What happened to your arm? You. Lie? Lionels? You OK? (Grunting) Could be better. Forgive me Jed, but- I look at somebody like you, and you did it all, man. You met a girl, you fell in love, you got married, man. You went the whole nine yards. What's your fucking secret, man? I guess the secret is to have no secrets. Goddamn it. Yeah, you have a pretty big fucking secret, Lionel. I know, yeah. I mean, there's nothing more beautiful than a man's relationship with his food. I mean, in moderation. Well, how about love? You know, trusting and loving oneself enough to not even think twice about what the other person feels about you. You know, 'radiating happiness'. Right? Touché, Jed. (Glasses clink) Touché. So, is there a Mrs Flack in the running? I barely introduced myself to the last one. She lost her head and went cold on me. Go and get your camera for me. Huh? I'm gonna find you a girl. Or a guy- Or a guy- -A girl. Well, go and get it then. (And then we pose) -Whoa whoa whoa, what are you doing? -What? Unless you want a dick pic as your profile picture, I suggest you go and get your best get-up on. Well, what is that? Well, how the fuck am I- (Jed groans) Just be yourself. (Pose) You can do better than that, mate. Come on. No. No. No. No. Find something else. What the fuck is that? -No? -Oh, for the love of God. OK, look. Go into my duffle bag, the grey one. In there, you'll find a blue polo neck. Put that on. Tell you what, lose the glasses for me. Eh, good enough. (Camera clicks) Let's get one of you and me. (Jed groans) (Camera clicks) Tomorrow's a big day, brother. I need you to get some sleep and be clear headed, OK? I'm on it. Attaboy. (Ominous music) (Footsteps approaching) Rise and shine city slicker! Meet me in the living room in five minutes. We're going out. (Door slams) (Jed groans) (Phone ringing) Flack! You forgot your fish tin. Who is this? It's Alex. Oh! (chuckles nervously) So, erm, did you tell him? Did I tell who what? Your boyfriend. Did you tell him how you feel about him? Alex, I'm not gay. You're not? No, I... I think you misunderstood me. In fact, I think we both misunderstood each other, if I'm honest. I'm so confused right now. Can I take you out for dinner tonight? What? Like a- -like a date? Yeah, Lionel. Like a date. Huh. Well, I'll be damned. Yeah! Hows about 6pm tonight at Geeman's Lair? That sounds perfect. See you tonight? Lionel? Yeah. Erm. Six. Six you tonight! (Phone beeps) Love you. Where are we going? Get in the chair. So, how far is it? Now, with your whistles, I need you all to show me what to do in the event of an emergency. (He blows his whistle) (They all blow their whistles) Excellent! Now, let's hit the water. You guys, single file onto the boat, and Jed, you're with me. Hey! Come here, now. What? Well, look at them. You know, they've been dealt the worst hand in the world, yet their just happy. It's beautiful, isn't it? I want that. I guess you don't know what you have until it's actually gone. Jed you've got me. Yeah, great. BOYS AND GIRLS, LISTEN UP! Fuck. Lionel, what the fuck? There comes a time in every man's life where he unexpectedly finds himself in a hole. Of course, the man usually has a good woman or a FRIEND... ...to pull himself out of the hole before it fills up with horse shit and he's left to die. He's alone. Abandoned. Ain't nobody but himself to save himself. SURVIVAL ONE 'O' FUCKING ONE! (GUNSHOT) -Lionel, what the fuck? -WHOO! You're gonna kill them! Oh, they know what to do. They're frightened! You're just gonna let them drown, we have to save them! THEY KNOW WHAT TO FUCKING DO! LIONEL! Is this everything you thought it would be? (Ominous music) (Pulsing) (Thunderous clap) (Rain thudding) Wake up. (Spluttering) (Coughing) Get ready. Get up. That was cruel. What's that now? I SAID YOU WERE FUCKING CRUEL. Oh, I was never gonna kill them, Jed. I saw you. I watched you while I was down there. You just stood there and watched. You left me there to die and you loved every second of it. That's what you wanted though, right? Is it not? To die? YOU CAME HERE TO DIE, JED. No. I am done, Lionel. I'm out. I'm going home. You are bound by a contract. FUCK YOUR CONTRACT! I see you now. And what do you see? A sad, scared, lonely little boy who just wants his fucking mommy. You're nothing more than a predator, consuming everything that you wish you could be. And underneath that... A child starved of love. You feed off the weak, Lionel. You are a coward. Say that again. I dare you. You... are... a FUCKING COWARD. FUCK! Now, some cultures believe that torturing the animal alive improves the taste and the quality of the meat. That's why today, I'm gonna give you something new. Although you won't be able to move an inch, the anesthetic properties are not so great. YOU ARE GONNA FEEL EVERY LAST FUCKING BIT OF THIS! (Jed shrieks) (Thumping) (Sadistic laughing) You need some time to cool off and think about your goddamn actions. (Door slams and locks) (Illegible murmering) (Glass smashing) (Clambering) It's shit. It's shit. (Lionel sobs) (Bellowing screams) (Smashing) FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! (Phone ringing) YOU PIECE OF SHIT. YOU PIECE OF SHIT. YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT (He screams) (Phone ringing) (Machine beeps) (Alex) Hey you. (Alex) I just wanted to say that I'm really looking forward to dinner and erm, (Alex) yeah I love that place. (Illegible murmering) (Alex) I'm really sorry that I got the wrong- -end of the stick the other day. (Alex) I'm such an idiot sometimes. (Alex) Actually, all the time, but yeah, you'll find that out on your own. (Alex) Anyway, yeah. I'll see you tonight at six. (Alex) Yeah, really looking forward to it. (Alex) I already said that, but OK. (Alex) Yeah, bye. See you. (Machine beeps) FUCK YOU. (Grunting) (Illegible murmering) It's cold on there. (Illegible murmering) (Panting) Are you ready to order, love? I'm still waiting for my- -Oh I'm so sorry I'm late. So sorry. No worries, I'll give you guys a moment. Thank you. Thanks. Hi- -Hi (Nervous laughter) I told him, I said, look buddy, I've known you for like forever, and- -I put you up, and I've given you the clothes off my back, and- -Hell, I've practically been to hell and back with you. And I just said "just talk to me, man". And what did he say? He didn't. They found him by her grave stone the next day. Oh my God, Lionel I'm so sorry. That must've been really hard for you. (They both giggle) How about we finish up here and head to my place for dessert? (Nervous laughter) Well, if you are. Tastes so much better, doesn't it? Mmm, I know it does. So, erm. Now that manners are out the window... Are you into anything weird? Like what? Erm. Sexual or- -Oh, no. No, not neccesarily. As an example, When I go to the supermarket, I get this urge to take things off the shelve and put them in other people's baskets. I find it really hilarious. That kind of stuff. OK, OK. So I, erm. Hmm I like to peel soap. Oh, that's a really good one. I like skin. Crispy chicken skin? I know what you mean. I absolutely love chicken skin. Anyone that doesn't like crispy chicken skin is a weirdo. No. I like your skin. I wanna eat your skin. Erm. I mean. It's just that I. Erm. I think you have beautiful skin. Will you just excuse me for one minute? (High pitched ringing) (Alex Shrieks) Is this it? Only if you want it to be. Is this what you want? No. You don't belong here. We don't belong here, Jed. What am I supposed to do? I don't stand a chance, he's taken everything from me. Not everything. I love you. I know. I love you too. I know. (Door slams) (Panting) (Door knocking) Who is it? Police. Can we have a word please, buddy? Mr Flack? Hold on! Is everything OK in there, Mr Flack? Hold on. (Knocking) Could you open up, please? Mr Flack? Apologies for disturbing you, we just have a couple of questions. Flack... Could you open up, please? What can I do for you two, officers? Mary Huggins, aka downstairs? What about her? Reported missing. Do you mind if we come in and take a look around, sir? Be my guest. Ah, man of many talents, are we? What's this then? Oh, that? (Laughs nervously) That is... That is, erm... My rendition of cubic abstract eroticism. Very good. What happened to your head? I shaved it. I got into a bit of a drunken stupor with the work colleagues last night, and you know, hence all the mess. Boys will be boys, hey Officer? What we got cooking then, bud?

He's a lying, manipulative snake! Slow down, come on, now. It's OK. Just tell me what happened. It's going to be OK. He kept me against my will.

Poor, lost soul shot himself right after he shot me. (Gunshot) (Lionel screams) FUCK! (Whimpering) (Screaming) Lionel? (Lionel shrieks) (He screams) Lionel! It's not gonna work. Look at me. Is it hard to see the world from inside the bowl? To be honest, I don't know what side of the glass I'm on. You think you're talking to Bermuda? Bermuda's dead, Lionel. I didn't wanna see you hurt, so I got you a new one. Hey can we... Can we just... Can we just- -sit and eat? Please. Please. Jed. I am so, so sorry- -L'CHAIM! (Grunting) (Panting) (Grunting) (Grunting) Come on. Fuck. You can let me go, now. (Distant sirens) (Jed laughs) (Distant sirens approaching) (Jed laughs)
