Okay, I'm not gonna let you turn into flesh soup. - Really? - Really. I'm gonna call my mom, and ask her if we can use Betty's house another few days. But wait a minute. Whoa! What about your shower? I'll cancel it. This is a little more important. No, no, no, I'm sorry. No, you're not going to cancel - anything at all. - [gentle music playing] I got an idea. Here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna drive the girls back to LA, and you just tell them that, I don't know, some sort of a work thing came up.

[crickets chirping] No. I just think I need to be alone right now. This is... Whoo... A lot to process. And you're sure there's nothing I can do? Could you drive me somewhere to rent a car?

Oh, oh, wait a minute. They're... they're offering 100,000-dollar... exclusive engagement fee. - Whoa, 100,000 dollars? - Oh, my God. You can take half of that into an IRA and the rest in a simple index fund, - and you will be sitting pretty. - Whoa! Surprisingly robust advice from a man in daytime sweatpants. Okay. It's a man whose life strategically allows him to wear - daytime sweatpants. Thank you. - Oh. Now please respond to this. Well, of course. That goes without saying. - Whoo! - This is very cool, Rita. So cool. Wow! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - [chuckles] - I'm so happy. Yeah. [romantic music playing] [soft moaning] Oh, dear. Whoo, whoo. Yeah. Wow. Anyway, do you still want to order, or...? - Yeah, that's... yeah. Mm-hmm. - Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna go grab my laptop, I'll... And so we can look together. I'll be right back. Okay, yep. That's a... A... a smart idea. [Rita] Smart. Yeah. [engine revving] [distant siren blaring] - [both] Um... - [grunts] - Honestly, we can just eat... - What? - ...in my car. - No, no, no, no. No way. No, just watch and learn. Oh, uh, excuse me. I'm sorry. But you chickens wouldn't mind scooting over just a little smidge for an old gal? Oh, it's so sweet of you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you so much. [Rita] Oh, my goodness. Ooh. Ah. Okay. I kissed Jack. Like in one of those for-real, big time... - What? - Oh, my God. Carla, I just went for it. [laughs] A real, big-time... [Carla humming] ...romantically interested kiss. Stop! Carla, I just kind of said to myself, "You go for it," because when have I ever even done that? Initiate a kiss? It's like a first kiss? I just don't even do things like that. Okay. You're not the only one with a surprise. [chuckles] What do you mean? [paper rustles] Your boy is gonna be downtown this weekend, - doing a pop-up. - Uh-huh. Regress and be blessed. [exhales] You okay? Well, yeah. I mean, I'm really good. I mean, it obviously would be crazy to keep living like this. Yeah, Mack. Everything that's happening for you right now is because you're showing the world who you are, right? - [cellphone ringing] - Oh, shit. Oh, God. Oh, yeah. It's Stephanie. I gotta get this. I'll be right back. Hey, listen, I'm kind of in the middle of something, so can I call you back? Knix needs Rita to appear at the Marie Claire Power Summit. It's a big deal. Santa Monica Beach by the pier. Friday. They need me to confirm today. Oh, wow. I mean, that is so cool. - But what is that anyway? - [Stephanie] Oh, I don't know, just a major event that celebrates the power of women thrown by a publication you would die to have your little, stinky pieces run in? - [chuckles] Oh. - [Stephanie] Knix is a top spons, and they wanna roll out Rita's ambassadorship with them. I really can't. I... I mean, that's the night of Carla's rehearsal dinner. [Stephanie] Yeah, I don't think they really care if you're there. I mean, you could go if you want to get a swag bag of, like, free yoni eggs or something, but Knix has made it crystal clear that the event is mandatory for Rita. So, please make sure she shows. [scoffs] [sighs] [gentle music playing] [traffic rumbling] - [Jack] Hey. - Hey, nice robe. Thanks. Wore it home from the spa. Um, I just don't understand how someone so handsome, thank you, could be quite so strange. Well, I was, uh, in the fifth percentile for weight - until I was, like, 17, so... - Oh. My personality just developed before my looks. And so that explains everything. - Yeah. Shall I? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. - So, how was your day? - [Rita] So... What, uh... what's going on? You all right? - You have a rough day or what? - Oh, yeah, I just... Oh, God. I have to make a big decision and I just hate making big decisions. Mm. That's so weird because I love big decisions. - Hit me. - Okay. I... So, there's this big Knix partner event on the same day as Carla's rehearsal dinner. So, skip the rehearsal dinner. Well, Jack, I mean, that's a really huge thing to skip. I've never gotten married before, but if I did, I don't think that I would care that much if my best friend's aunt wasn't there. - I can't miss it. - Okay, well, then skip the event. No, but I... but, you know, then I'll lose my contract. I'll lose the 100,000 dollars. Uh, okay. Do you have the contract? Can I... can I see the paperwork on it? - Yeah, no... - On your phone? Oh, that... You don't have to do that. No, I'm... I'm very good at this kinda thing. - Trust me. - Oh. Yeah, no. Okay. - Yeah. - Sure. Of course. Okay. It's right... it's on here. - Okay. - See, it's right there. Okay. - Okay. Okay, so... - What? Uh, this only says that you have to attend the event, but it doesn't say anything about how long - you have to stay there for. - Oh, really? So, why don't you just go to the event, and then leave early, and you'll make it in time for the rehearsal dinner. You know what? This is such a great idea. - Of course! - You sound surprised. Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, you're... You're very smart. - I'm smart. - Yes, you are. Yeah. See, finally some honesty. [chuckles] I can't help it. I'm sorry. - Oh, boy. I need some wine. - Yeah. ["Bare Burden" by Baxters] Oh, excuse me, but, you know, I have to leave early. But it's not a problem. Um, hi, hello. Rita Martin. That's my name. Yes. [photographer 1] Rita, over here. [woman 1] Is that Rita Martin? - [photographer 2] Here, Rita. - [camera shutters clicking] [indistinct chatter] [applause] [lively chatter] ♪ Who's scrolling Through my feed? ♪ ♪ Who's wishing they were me? ♪ - I am dead. - Whoo! Excuse me! - Aunt Rita in the flesh. You... - Yes. - Are so freaking R-E-A-L. - Oh! My friends and I are huge fans. - Well, thank you so much. - I'm Sam. I'm the marketing manager for Knix. - Oh! - Not to brag, but I am the one that told my bosses they had to reach out to you. [chuckles] Well, thank you. Really? I... Wow. It's just, I appreciate that so much. - You've got to come... - Where? ...to the VIP area for Urth. Oh, oh, well. Earth? Urth. She's leading the collective breathing seminar that's closing out the day. Oh, no. You know, I really... Honestly, I can't do that. - Thank you so much. - You crack me up. - Come on. Come on. - Yeah, oh, what do you mean? - Oh. - You know, I was one of the 10,000 to unfollow Lil' Yachty after he commented that your sweater was too loose. - What was that? - Oh. Oh, I don't know. You know, he's obsessed with me. - It's honestly kind of weird. - Well, so am I. [laughs] So, anyway, just enjoy the event, and I'm just gonna capture some video of you in your natural habitat. - Okay? - Okay, but wait, wait. I want to thank you for this offer, of course... - Yeah, you bet. - ...but just one quick thing. - Hmm? - Um, I have my best friend's rehearsal dinner tonight. So, actually, I'm... I'm gonna have to leave now. - I totally hear you... - So, anyway... ...but if you could just stick around for a few more minutes, okay? We're gonna be streaming this on Instagram Live, and I want to make sure that you are front and center. [chuckles] Yeah, oh. Oh, but, you see, that's the opposite of what I said I wanted to do. - Mm. Yeah. Mm. - Uh-huh. But it's just, we have to make sure that our new partners are familiar with our followers. - Uh-huh. I see... - That's how it works. I've seen some incredible partners lose contracts... - Yeah, but... - ...just because the fans - don't see them as friends. - Oh. So, no pressure, you know, but make it organic, you know? Have your own experience and... And we are looking to create some moments here. - So, energy up! Big smiles. - Well... Wait, what? Rah-rah-rah! Yeah. [Eurobeat remix of P! nk's "Fuckin' Perfect"] All right, my warriors. Who's ready to find their light? [cheering] [Urth] Oh, my warriors. I want you to repeat after me. For us! Okay. For us! For you! For me! Let me hear you! [crowd] For us! [Urth] For you! [crowd] For you! For me! [crowd] For me! [Urth] For us! For you! - Yeah. - [Urth] For me! Oh, yes. Your chanting, it nourishes my soul. - Ah! - We are not here to work out our abs or our glutes or our triceps. No. We are here to work on our souls. - Our soul! - [cheering] Ho-ho. We did not come here to exercise our bodies. No. We came here to explore size our demons! - For me! - [Urth] Let me hear you! For us! For you! For me! - [cheers] - Oh, yes! I feel it. I feel it, you are powerful. Oh! That is a warrior right there! - Huh? - Yes. Come on up here. - [Rita] Really? - Come on. Come on, yes! [all cheering] [Urth] Come on up here! Yes, warrior! Yes! Oh! Yes! [all cheering] [both ululating] I am a warrior. [crowd] I am a warrior! - Yes! Yes! - [screaming] Squat and feel it, yeah! - [screaming] - [yells] No! - You're on fire! - On fire! - [Rita screaming] - [crowd clamoring, screaming] Everybody, let's not panic. Let's just grab a buddy. [wailing] Everybody calm down! Everybody, it's gonna be good! We're gonna be okay. Everybody just... just... Yeah. That... Move in that direction. Are you all right? I'm so sorry. I... I think you should... Help! Carla, Carla, it's me. I'm almost there. I'm really, I'm... I'm... Quite frankly, I'm there. Really. I mean... [tires screech] So, we'll see you guys tomorrow. - Love you. - [Rita] Carla? [footsteps approaching] Carla. Oh! - Are you okay? - I... I just, I got stuck at that Marie Claire thing, and, you know, it's the kind of situation where you just don't know what you can say no to and... and what you can't. And I set myself on fire. I know. It's crazy. [sighs] I'm not gonna lie, Mack. I'm really, really bummed you didn't make it tonight. You missed my rehearsal dinner for an influencer event? - You're my maid of honor. - I... I know. I... You've been my best friend my whole life. And I've loved every single version of you. But right now, Mack, Rita, whatever, I don't recognize the person standing in front of me. And it has nothing to do with what you look like. I'm... I'm so sorry, Carla. The one thing we've always done for one another is show up. You didn't do that tonight. And it just really makes me sad. - [somber music playing] - [whimpers] [car door opens] [car engine starts] Oh, God. I don't know what I'm doing half the time. [sniffles] Hey, thought I'd find you up here. - Is everything okay? - Oh. Yeah. - Hey. - What? Rita, look at me. - [crying] Please, Jack. - Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. No. It's okay. It's okay. Look, you don't have to be embarrassed in front of me. - [Rita] No. - Here, here. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm just so really frustrated with who I am right now. Because I haven't always been like this, Jack, you see. You know, I thought, like, being in a different place, you know, it'd help me feel better. You know, it'd help me be a better person. But today, I was worse, just... I was a bad friend. It just sounds like you had a really bad day, but that doesn't make you a bad person. - Jack... - No, you are one of the best people that I've ever met. Why? Why are you being so nice to me? [cries] Why? Huh? - Don't do that. - Because I like you. What's the matter with you anyway? Huh? I mean, you want, like, a full list? No, no, I'm really serious. You spent the past month hanging out with an old lady like she's your girlfriend or something. What are you trying to avoid, Jack? Nothing. [scoffs] Listen, I know that my life doesn't look like what you think a 40-year-old's life should look like, but I love it. And I have done enough therapy to know that I like myself. And when I met you, I saw someone who was comfortable being exactly who they are. And I know that... You know, you're not going to be here forever. You've got your own life to go back to. Exactly. I have a life, Jack. And I've lost sight of who I really am. Do you understand what I mean? I mean, I can't really stay here. I just can't stay here, Jack. I can't do that anymore. [soft music playing] [loud knocking] [Rita sighing] Wha-oh! You wanna tell us what's going on... Mack? [Angela] Well, I need a refill. Anyone else? Yeah. If what you just said is true, I cannot possibly tell you how stupid you sound. - Nobody wants to be old. - No, no. Sure they do. Yes. My grammie used to always say this thing about, like, how when you're old, you get the best seat at the table. Oh, you get any seat at the table, because people know your bones hurt. [women laugh] You get the best seat at the table because you realize what you want and don't want. And maybe the best seat at the table is in the other damn room, where you're 30. - [women laugh] - [Sharon] Right. Rita, I... I mean Mack. You know those 30 years you skipped so that you could, uh, maybe wear, uh, elastic waistbands and, uh, whatever? [women snickering] Those are the good years. Those are the you years. And you really don't want to skip those. - [Carla] Nuh-uh. - The 30 after that, they're good, too. But, oh, those middle years... Oh, man. Mwah! [Sharon] It's not magic, sweetheart. - It's just work. - Oh. You? You had to work on yourself? Oh. I was married to a man named Steve. And then I spent my middle age building a home with a woman named Tina, so... - Tina. - [Angela] Mm-hmm. Yeah, I did some work. [chuckles] Mack, sweetheart, you didn't want to be old. What you wanted was to be you. [women] Mm-hmm. [sighs] [paper rustles] - I gotta go, okay? - [Sharon] You got to go. - [Carla] You go, girl. - Yeah. You girls lock it up on your way out, okay? And get that hair out of your face. [Rita] I'm trying. - Okay, now I'll have some more. - Oh, yeah, baby. [indistinct chatter] [pensive music playing] [Rita] Oh, yeah, right. Okay. Wow. [groans] Okay. Okay, hell. Okay. Luca! Luca! Where are you, you son of a bitch? Luca! Luca! Luca! Lu... oh! - Do you have an appointment? - No. No, Luca. I don't have an appointment, Luca. Okay, you're coming in with a lot of energy. - We don't really do that here. - Uh-huh. Really? You didn't turn me into this? I happen to be a 30-year-old woman... - Keep it down. - ...and this is not my face! - Mm. - And this is not my hair. And guess what? This is not my body! Okay, look, lady. I don't know what drugs - you're on right now... - You did this to me! But this is an old broken tanning bed I got off Craigslist. It doesn't do anything, okay? But wait a second, sir. In Palm Springs, I laid down in that pod, and when I came out, I was in this body. Okay, I'm gonna go get you a cup of water. Maybe... No, no, no! Don't you dare! You get over here. You open that tin can up right now. - All right. - Yes! All right. Stop yelling at me. Jesus. What? - Just get in. It's... - [Rita] Oh. Oh, my God. - Go. - [groans] - [Luca] Okay. - [grunts] [machine hissing, powering on] I'm sorry I yelled at you, lady. That... that was not very Zen of me. Come on. Work, okay? Work! It's okay. Just calm down. Relax. [inhales] Breathe. [mystical music playing] You're not saying your whole spiel. Please just say it. - Please. - Think about who you are. Come on. - Think about who you wanna be. - Work, damn it! Work. Come on. Life can take you on a winding path that often moves in both directions. Come on! It's important to remember that... - [Rita] Okay. - ...time is merely a construct. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - [Luca] Who you are... - [air whooshing] ...who you were... [electricity crackling] [Luca] Who you're going to be... [dramatic music playing] It's all within you at this very moment. [exhales] [Mack grunts] [gasps] [squeals, cheers] [gasps] Oh, yes. Yes! Yes! Oh, I missed you. I missed you. Oh, my God. Hah! [giggles] Whoa! [chuckles, squeals, gasps] Oh! [breathing heavily] - [squealing] - [Luca] This thing... [cheering] Yes! - [sighs] Oh. - [cheery music playing] - Oh, my God. [breathes deeply] - [cheery music playing] I'm back. I'm back. [squeals] Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - What just happened? I know. It's crazy! I need to go. I have to go. Thank you! - You're welcome. - [chuckles] [car rumbling] [tires screeching] [uplifting music playing] Carla! - Oh! - Oh! [both squealing] [Mack] Don't cry. - [gasping] - [Sharon] She's happy. - [grunts] Well... - I'm gonna cry. Don't cry. You're getting married. Oh, my God. You look so beautiful. - Oh, my gosh. - I kinda miss the gray. I know. Me, too. [chuckles] Oh, it's so good to see you, sweetheart. [chuckles] - Hi! - [women cheer, laugh] - I thought you were dead! - [indistinct chatter] Go change. Yes. 'Cause you are wearing white and jeans at a wedding, and that's crazy. Close your mouth, honey. - We did it. - [woman 2 chuckling] [soft humming] [keys jingle] Ooh, ooh, yeah. [chuckles] [footsteps approaching] Oh! Uh, hey. - Hey. - Hey. Uh... [chuckles] - Whoo, sorry. Hey, you. - [chuckles] I'm sorry. It is... It's weird that I'm here right now. I... I realize that. I just... I didn't know if Rita... She's... she's gone. Oh, yeah. We swapped back. Apartments, which is what we swapped in the first place. So, yeah, she's in, uh, Scottsdale. Seriously? I never even got to say goodbye. We, um... Yeah, we just kind of were hanging out while she was staying here. Oh? Hanging out? Well, we just both had nothing to do, so we did nothing together. [giggles] She's, um, really not like anyone I've ever met before. [romantic music playing] Well... [breathes deeply] ...for what it's worth, she told me that you were really cool, too. Maybe a little too old for a skateboard. She said that? I... I mean, the... the first thing, about being cool? Because I knew how she felt about my skateboard. Yeah. She did. Cool. You think she's ever coming back? Someday, maybe. But not for a really, really long time. Okay. Uh, if you do talk to her, please just tell her I said hi. I will. [burps] Oh, God. I'm sorry. Sorry. I, um... ugh! I had too many shrimp. But they were the big ones. The jumbo, like, for sure genetically engineered ones? For sure genetically engineered ones. Yeah. [chuckles] Okay. [door closes] [crickets chirping] [indistinct chatter] [gasps] Congrats on your new book. You know, I've been seeing a lot of people posting pictures of it on their legs on the beach - and they call that hotdogging. - Oh, very cool. I gotta be honest, I kind of miss Rita. Her French exit from the feed was one of the sexiest things I've ever seen, and I've seen porn. Mm-hmm. Also, thank you for recommending the Instagrammies to me. The drunkest one, she has over 500,000 followers and it just makes me be like, "What have you ever done for me?" Oh, yeah. They're... They're awesome. [cellphone ringing] Oh, wait. S... s... Co... yeah, copy that. Okay. Hi! [gasps] Thank you so much for coming. [chuckles] Hi, bebe. I'm so proud of you. [crowd] Ooh! - All right, you ready? Ready? - Yes. Yes, sorry. All right, everyone, let's get jazzed - for this reading. - [cheering] - Yeah. - [woman 3] You go, girl. Um, so that's me, right? Uh... [chuckles] Hi. Uh, thank you all for coming. [woman 4] Uh-uh. I... I really... I wanted to share this book with the people in my life who mean the most to me. My first book was a series of essays about my grandma. [uplifting music playing] And until very recently, she was the only person in my life who made me feel like I had license to be myself. And when she died, I... I thought that I had lost that. I, uh... [sighs] I had a really hard time feeling like I was enough. And, uh, I... I worried so much about, you know, all the things that made me, me. That they were too weird, too different, and not fun, not cool. [chuckles] And it took a, uh... a near-death experience to realize that that's not true. I realized that the people in my life who I love... Love those things about me, too. And believing that gave me the confidence to show myself, you know, to new people. And to finally write another book, so... [cheering and applause] Without further ado... [applause] Okay. Here we go. All right, let's see. [clears throat] [exhales] "I grew up always feeling like I was an older woman trapped in the body of a little girl." "I think that's why I was so fond of the term 'old gal.'" "I was raised by my grandma." "And she was the coolest 'old gal' I ever knew." "All I wanted was to be like Grammie Martin." "But like any kid, I had to fit in." - ["Beautiful" by Anne-Marie] - ♪ Are we beautiful ♪ ♪ All of us? ♪ ♪ 'Cause we got Something natural ♪ ♪ It's a part of us ♪ ♪ Darlin', when they put You down like that ♪ ♪ Yeah, you can Reply right back ♪ ♪ You are beautiful, yeah ♪ ♪ I know, I know you are ♪ ♪ I know, I know, you are ♪ ♪ I found myself looking again ♪ ♪ Wondering why my body Doesn't look like them ♪ ♪ Know it might sound weird But I refuse to pretend ♪ ♪ And then you probably think The same every now and again ♪ ♪ I got more than All these scars ♪ ♪ I got flaws And broken hearts ♪ ♪ I don't like this stranger ♪ ♪ Staring at me, yeah ♪ ♪ All the things you do to me ♪ ♪ Tell me the truth ♪ ♪ Are we beautiful? ♪ ♪ All of us? ♪ ♪ 'Cause we got Something natural ♪ ♪ It's a part of us ♪ ♪ Darlin', when they put You down like that ♪ ♪ Yeah, you can Reply right back ♪ ♪ You are beautiful, yeah ♪ ♪ I know, I know you are ♪ ♪ I know, I know you are ♪ ♪ We are beautiful, yeah ♪ ♪ I know, I know, we are ♪ ♪ We are beautiful, yeah ♪ ♪ I know, I know We are, we are ♪ ♪ I know, I know, we are ♪ ♪ We are beautiful ♪ ♪ I know, I know we are ♪ [gentle music playing] [music concludes]
