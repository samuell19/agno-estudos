THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE BY THE 53RD GRADUATING CLASS OF CHENGJUN MIDDLE SCHOOL - We're going to be best friends for life! - We're going to be best friends for life! I'm so envious. Good job, girls. Thank you. Good luck. We will be best friends for life too. It's not that easy. Are we going to stick together forever? How boring. I think it's pretty great. Wouldn't that cause us to fight more? However, we will surely make up after fighting. It won't be that easy. You're too naïve. Why don't we make a rule? If we ever have a fight, everyone has to say what she did wrong. Don't always blame others. That way, we can be friends forever. Just say yes. Okay. Let's treasure this opportunity. After graduation, it might be hard for us to get together to sing and dance. Yes. Let's never fight again. - Okay. - Yes. Please welcome the students of Class 4, Grade 3, who will perform a song and dance, - Smile. - "Kiki." Give them a round of applause. There's something wrong with the song. Dean, this song is about meeting people for drinks and gossip. It's a bad influence. Stop them. You three, stop dancing! Who approved this dance? Turn off the music! - Quiet! - Sit down! What should we do? I told you not to pick this song. What are you three doing? How dare you sing this song? Get off the stage. Move aside. Are you guys not going to talk to me? What is there to say? PRIVATE GOODS LATE 2020 A FEW DAYS AGO Why is this menu so complicated? What dishes do you recommend? We only offer one set menu. Then why give us menus? Give us three set meals. It's to inform you of the ingredients. - Does anybody have dietary restrictions? - Yes. - Fang Xin. - Take a look. Did you go to Shanghai just for onboarding? Yes, the company's promotional ads for the new season will be shot outside of Chengdu. The big boss will come, so I have to go too. It's a good chance to finish organizing my suitcase. How is the new company? Did they give you a hard time about your pregnancy? Not at all. Our company is very friendly to women. Do you know what our boss said? As long as you apply for leave in advance, HR will approve it. About 80% of our company is female employees. There's no overtime. Outside of work, people often meet for dinner, karaoke, and drinking. It's a great environment. That's good. It's better than the last company. Aren't you going to miss Zhang Ting? Yes, a little. However, I've been living with him lately and haven't gotten a good night's sleep. The other night, I was already asleep. What are you doing? Zhang Ting. What are you doing? I just read an article online. It said humidity is particularly harmful to pregnant women. You're prone to allergies, so I have to take care of it today. Don't you think lack of sleep is worse for a pregnant woman? No, that's not clean yet. Go to bed and leave me be. I heard that men get prenatal anxiety too. - I guess it's true. - Yes, I think so too. That's not the only thing he's overly worried about. Sorry. Could you turn your Wi-Fi down a little bit? Sorry. Could you leash your dog? We have a pregnant woman here. All the neighbors had the same reaction as you. Just like this. You're so nice to your wife. Well, she's my girlfriend. Stunned, the old man said… A baby on the way and still not married? The old lady bluntly said… Who knows if the baby is his? Of course it's his. It's his, right? It's mine. Anyway, I feel that he's overreacting. I know he's just looking out for me, but if this keeps up, one of us will go nuts. - Well... - This is the first course. It's called Full Circle. - It proves... - The ingredients for this dish have been carefully curated. In the process of making it, we also shunned conventional heating methods. - Zhang Ting... - Breaking the mold and boldly innovating is the essence of our molecular cuisine. Please enjoy. Where were we? -I said he's responsible... - Right. -Scallions were omitted for you. - Thank you. Noodles? A staple food to start with? It's yams. Yams? Are these gimmicky restaurants popular these days? How long will you and Lu Bin stay in the hotel? - When will the new house be ready? - I don't know. The renovation workers have been delayed for months. You two spend every day together. Do you fight? We don't fight. However, he has been a bit weird lately. "Brand…" It's 10:30 p.m. That's no big deal. However, in a script meeting the next day, I said… This script isn't good. The pace is too fast. It ends just as viewers get into it. It comes across as hasty and rushed. Have the writers change it. Then I looked up and saw Lu Bin looking at me strangely. Of course he would. - Yes. - I didn't mean it like that. However, the next night… Give me a minute. You're bragging. I don't mean to brag, but the next morning, as I was brushing my teeth, Lu Bin asked me, "What did you think of the show last night?" I really thought he meant the show, so I told him… I thought it started off great. It kept viewers in suspense. However, the ending was crap. Really? I actually thought the plot was totally captivating. Did we watch the same show? - Were you really talking about the show? - Were you really talking about the show? I really was talking about the show. And then he just had to go against me. Do you have a problem with me? He weirdly insisted that I was insinuating something. You really weren't? No. Yes, you were. No. You're being too sensitive. In the end, he blamed me. Then you're just too picky. I'm going to work. So early? Is the gym open yet? You're insinuating something. Lu Bin isn't entirely to blame. You put too much pressure on him. He thinks he's not good enough. You should put yourself in his shoes. There's such a big difference in your pay and you talk with weird undertones. - I don't do that. - Besides, you always blame others. Well, he's a man. You can't ask me to... Spherification is molecular cuisine's classic technique. This is our second course. - It uses a type of fluid... - Okay, you don't have to say more. Okay, please enjoy. Just put yourself in his shoes for a bit. Be considerate of each other. The inside of this is also soup. It's just regular seafood soup. By the way, how is your restaurant doing? I was reading the reviews online the other day. They're not very good. Customers are tough to please. They give a one-star rating just for slow service. Your restaurant is in the red. It's a bottomless pit. Maybe you should just close it. No, I want to hang in there. What if things turn around? How about we take a guess? Which one turns around first, your career and your love life? Love life? What's going on? - You were away in Shanghai. - Stop it. Why don't you tell me? I'll say it. - She and Jiang Shanmu aren't talking. - Shut up. I visited Jiang Shanmu on set. As you know, he's an assistant director. There were so many girls in that hotel hallway. Young ones, charming ones, and innocent-looking ones. When I came to Shanmu's room, I saw him rehearsing -with a girl dressed in a cheongsam. - Like this, director? Very good. No problem, director. - Try it like... - Are you busy? Liu Jing, you're here. Okay, let's call it a day. I'll let you know if I hear anything. Were you mad? That's his job. Hold on. Let her finish it. - There's the takeout part. It's great. - Why don't you tell her then? All right. This damn Jiang Shanmu... Enough. I knew you would exaggerate. I'll tell it myself. -Someone later called for Shanmu. - Sir, come take a look. He gave his phone to me and told me to order takeout. As soon as I unlocked it, a message popped up. WOMEN IN YOUR AREA ARE INTERESTED IN YOU High-end ingredients often require the simplest... Stop. I said no more introductions. Okay, please enjoy. What happened after that? I later found out that it was an app called Haohao. Haohao? It's that trending app for making friends. Come on. It's not for making friends. It's a dating app. Was he using it? What is this? It's an app I installed before we started dating. I forgot to delete it. - Do you believe him? - I don't believe you. So I told him directly… Let's break up. You didn't mean it. I was furious. And then what? Then Jiang Shanmu said to her… I'll delete it right in front of you. Then he added… Are you happy now? See? Has he deleted it? Who knows? Even if he did… What if you reinstalled it? I use this app to find extras. Liu Jing! Actually, I just wanted him to apologize. So many days have passed now and he hasn't even texted me. Well, you could have texted him yourself. Why should I compromise? It was clearly his fault. Listen. Once there's a seed of suspicion, there's no end to it. Trust is important between two people. These definitely can't be peanuts. They are peanuts. The soil is edible. Don't you think this molecular gastronomy a little gimmicky and artificially mysterious? Exactly. Putting in various twists just to give you an unexpected feeling. This is very interesting. - What is this? - I thought you didn't want introductions. Enjoy. Gosh, this looks so real. It's so fragrant. Excuse me. The flowers are ornaments. It's best not to eat them. Use this. Take in the floral fragrance while enjoying the final dessert course. It's a nice drink. That's something. Not bad. Chef. Chef, property management wants the person in charge to go downstairs. Take a look. Fire safety rectification - is a matter of safety for all, - We know that… so everybody, please understand. It's not a matter of understanding. We have to close starting tomorrow. Get your manager here. We want a good explanation. They could have given earlier notice. I ordered the ingredients last night. Now, they'll all go to waste. - Me too. - Excuse me. Which one of you is Chef Liu Jing? - I'm not. - I am. Are you Liu Jing? Let's have a word. Okay. Hello, I'm Wu Tie. Here is my business card. We're an MCN company. Sorry. It's too short. Are you okay? - Do you have a backup copy? - Yes. I brought it over. What do you think of this? This is keeping it more simple. It fits with our brand positioning. However, if we go in this direction, we should abandon the studio shoot altogether. Let's do a location shoot. What's the plan, Alice? - We've booked Bipeng Valley. - Thank you. It's an outstanding shooting location near Chengdu. Also, the place is surrounded by snow-capped mountains. I think it's good. With the blue sky, white clouds, and snowy mountains, the pictures will be more dramatic and the content will also be richer. Kevin, let me see the photo shoot application. - Ms. Zhang. - It's approved. I'll get it. If you're feeling really sick, ask Ms. Zhang for leave. Emma. - What? - Come here. - Excuse me. - Okay. Hurry and talk to Ms. Zhang, okay? I lost it. I lost the form. - Didn't I give it to you last time? - Not so loud. Keep it down. Then hurry and go… Ms. Zhang, I want to... Your water broke. I'm sorry. I thought I wasn't due for another two or three weeks. Ms. Zhang, I'm going to go and give birth. Kevin, call a cab for Emma. - Okay. - Do you need Alice to come too? No. I can manage. Fang Xin, what were you going to ask me? Nothing. Then I'll leave Emma's work with you. I think the theme and the plan are all too superficial. I hope you can do better. Alice is… My brother! My brother, are you okay? I'm fine. I won't let anything happen to you. As long as you're fine, then I'm fine. Ms. Xia, don't be so bitter. - What's wrong? - This was supposed to be our project. Jichong had already secured it. Then Ms. Xia later rejected it. Nobody expected it to become a hit on another platform. Look, it's only halfway through. It'll be the top drama of the year. Their lips aren't even touching. Speed it up. What? How can you stand watching it so slowly? Mr. Hu. Sixteen episodes and five billion views. Excellent. Who knows if the data is real or not? That would mean every person in the country has watched it five times. How is that possible? Xia Meng, come with me. Do you remember the project from the last idea session, Nirvana? It's a comic book that blends sci-fi and mythical fantasy. Yes, it just won the Titan Award. The author, Luo KK, has just returned from abroad. I need you to talk to him. Secure this project as soon as possible. But I don't like the subject matter. If you don't like it, then it's good. Those you like don't make money. You're our company's reverse indicator. The more you don't like something, the harder we must pursue it. Your group's performance last year was very poor. If you don't produce a hit this year, somebody is going to get fired. As for who that will be, it's up to you. Ms. Xia, did Mr. Hu say we're in trouble? What trouble? You were the worst executive at last year's annual party. We all felt humiliated. This year, we have to do better. Who cares about the annual party? I've never seen you like this about work. Go through the Nirvana project again and send it to me. Ms. Xia, work is always important, but the annual party - only happens once a year. - Yes. If you don't do well at the annual party, your boss won't appreciate you. We can at least dance better than HR and Operations, right? They're all so old. Ms. Xia, look. My goodness. Is that Wang and Yang? Who's in the back flipping around? He's not an employee. That's her son. Outside aid. Southwest District hip-hop dance champion. - Yes. - Yes. We must be better dancers than those IT nerds, right? - Miles people! Miles soul! - Miles people! Miles soul! Five, six, seven, eight! - One, two, three, four! - They're like a male dance group. - Five, six, seven, eight! - That's right. Well, let's quickly think of a show. - What's our dance? - Ms. Xia. The year-end bonus is lower this year. The new company rules state that employees below K8 can't be forced to participate. - I'm K7. - I'm K6. -K7. - K6. - K5. - I didn't ask you. Ms. Xia, you won't perform alone, will you? No way. I'm also getting outside aid. Really? Ms. Xia, with a great salary comes great responsibility. Go for it. This time, we should… The measurements are done. Watch this dance once more. We haven't agreed to this yet. Yes, look. Is this suitable for pregnant women? They kick so high. Don't worry. I checked. A little cardio is good for pregnant women. Really? Why don't we do the routine we did in middle school? - That's right. - No, that's too easy. Besides, if this move is too difficult, you can simplify it. - Look. - It's not a matter of simplification. If you need outside aid, why don't you find professionals? Why get us amateurs? Do you think I don't want professionals? None of the dance teachers I know is available. I had to pull some strings to get this video. Isn't this a bit too ambitious? Liu Jing. Fang Xin. You two are all I have now. You can't be so heartless. Don't you remember who got you a lawyer for your divorce? Who did all the paperwork for your restaurant? I know. Don't make it sound so serious. - Moral blackmail. - Exactly. Enough chitchat. I've decided. Starting tomorrow, we're going to train like hell. There's no way we won't get first place. Like hell? How about we start now? Let's go. Look, Fang Xin. You're this one. Liu Jing, you're her. - Are you serious? - I'm here, okay? Come on. You're over here. Come on. That back bend. You can skip the back bend. This is way too hard. - Here? - Switch positions. This is so hard. All right. It'll be no problem. - Your phone. - Liu Jing, do your best. After that, a waist bend. It's Zhang Ting. Hi, what's up? - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. -Where are you? Why aren't you home? We're having fun at Xia Meng's place. It's late. Time to go home. You're pregnant. I'll go home in a while. I just got here. We're done. Yes, I'll take her home soon. Okay. All right. I'll be back soon. -Bye. - Bye. - Bye. -Bye. - I just got here. - Go home. - Why are you kicking me out? - Don't you have a sense of déjà vu? Don't get home too late. We'll get blamed if you two fight. What fight? - Go. - Liu Jing, aren't you leaving? I'm free. I'll stay for a bit. Has Shanmu not responded to you yet? I guess I'll leave too. Let's go. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. I'll send you the video. Remember to practice tomorrow. - Okay. - I got it. You're so naggy. THEN WHAT ABOUT MY MEMORIES? The elbow supports a side plank. The shoulders are 90 degrees from the torso. The elbow supports a side plank. DAD… - The upper arm is on the head. - Lu Bin. - The shoulders... - What are you doing? I'm studying for the Pilates test. When is it? Next week. What was it? The shoulders... The shoulders are 90 degrees from the torso. - Right. - Even I have memorized it. The shoulders are 90 degrees from the torso. What does this mean? The elbow supports a side plank. The shoulders are 90 degrees from the torso. Deliver the project proposal to KK's office. I'll go there directly to propose it. -Okay. - Right. Send me your feedback on the outline as soon as possible. -Okay, no problem. - All right. -I'm sorry. - It's okay. Be careful. -Zhang Ting, have a hot drink. - Slow down. Why aren't you using an umbrella? I'm fine. I'm sorry. It's raining so hard and I'm having you help move props. You should find a place to rest. Okay. Can I help with anything else? - No need. - Fang Xin. - Get some rest. - Be careful. The forecast shows the sun might not show. Ms. Tan is very upset. Why don't you update her on the shoot? - All right, I got it. - Thank you. Be more natural. Okay, hold that. Excuse me, Ms. Tan. We're really sorry. We didn't expect such heavy rain. It was our mistake. Our lighting equipment will need some small adjustments. Why don't you take a break? - Okay, it's fine. - Thank you. Look up. Be careful. Good. Move back. Good. Step back. Look at each other. Don't look at me. Look at each other. Smile. How can I photograph them when they have no chemistry? Can't we find a real couple? At least we need real eye contact. Fang Xin, isn't your husband here today? My boyfriend. What do you think of this couple? What? All right. Show a bit more affection. Now look at each other. Look at each other. Sir, back away for a bit. Pretend that it's a marriage proposal. Yes, a marriage proposal. A little more tenderness in your eyes. Deeper emotions. Okay, look at each other and smile. Pretend that you're accepting the marriage proposal. Bring the umbrella down. All right. - Very good. - Fang Xin. Let's get married. Fang Xin. Excuse me. Tan Kexin won't wait any longer. We can't do the shoot. What do we do? We can't come back here a second time. Come in. Ms. Tan, do you have a moment? Come in. Thank you. Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms. Tan. Thank you. We're almost ready. We can shoot very soon. You can get ready to change. Do you think we're still shooting today? I've been waiting since morning. The weather hasn't changed. It'll be the same even three hours later. How can we shoot in this weather? Don't you have a plan B? Well, this weather isn't exactly what we expected. However, our brand philosophy has always been... I don't care. I'm an actress. I want to know how I should perform. Your proposed theme is, "Marriage is a beautiful journey." With weather like this, tell me how I can convey that message. What if we think of it as an adventure? By adventure, I mean, we don't know what will happen in the future, but we're prepared to face all challenges. We would like to have you help us get this message across. Xiaomei, your feedback is such a tongue-twister. Okay, Ms. Xia. I'll make some changes. I'll send it to you soon. I'm here. I have to go. One-electron universe. Hello? - Hello. - Hello. I'm with Miles. I'm looking for Luo KK. - He's downstairs. I'll take you there. - Okay. KK! KK. KK. Someone is here for you. Hello, Mr. Luo. I'm Xia Meng. I'm here on behalf of Miles to talk to you about the rights to Nirvana. She's from Miles and wants to talk to you about the rights to Nirvana. No, Mandarin is okay. Okay. Mr. Luo, this is our proposal for the screen adaptation of your comics, along with a detailed data analysis. You can take a look. You can trust us with your work because we've had many hit shows in recent years, like The Journey of Cloud, Legend of Fuqiang, and the adaptation of the manga, The Long Song. These are all projects produced by my team on our platform. The Long Song is pretty good. It's a great show. Mrs. Luo has a good eye. I'm his agent. I'm Amanda. I spoke to you on WeChat. Mr. Luo, we're really very sincere. - If you're considering TV rights... - I'm wrapping up talks with Gulu Gulu. Gulu Gulu can't compete with our budget and they're always making shows for kids. Your platform only makes shows for girls. Who says we only make shows for girls? There are plenty of shows for guys, like thrillers, The Visitor's Secret, for example. I've seen that. Right? However, I didn't get it. Yes, the barrier to entry is a bit high. It only gets a five-point Douban review. Mr. Luo, let me tell you more about our plan. I'm sorry. What's your name? - Xia Meng. - Xia Meng. Okay, Xia Meng. First, I want to ask you. Which part of the story is your favorite? First of all, the story has a broad audience appeal. The fan base is huge. Your good looks will be the focus of our marketing. Hold on. My question is, what do you think of the story itself? The story itself… I love how the story ends with the protagonist using the law of entropy generation to reverse time. He knows that he's going to die, but he still uses the one-electron universe to redeem himself. I found it very moving. I didn't quite understand what you said. Could you say it in English? KK, girls don't know the law of entropy generation. What is so hard to understand? In a closed, isolated system, all internal particles will change from order to disorder and the process is irreversible. This is the law of entropy generation. Yes. I wasn't saying you don't know it. Well, I'll go back and do more research. Would you mind adding me to your WeChat, Mr. Luo? I don't use WeChat. How do you pay for things? She helps me pay. I help him pay. Hello. Is everyone drinking already? - Jichong. - Come on down. I've been waiting all day. - Come down. - Xia Meng? Do you two know each other? I'll get Jichong a drink. Jichong, there you are. Sorry, I'm late. It has been a long time. Come on. Ms. Xia, what are you doing here? My ex-girlfriend. I'm his ex-boss. KK, the roast chicken is ready. Let's eat. I have a book here. Here. I signed this for you. Sorry about this. You rarely sign autographs. No problem. You're a friend. Jichong, KK, come eat. - You go first. - Okay. Do you really like this book? It's okay. Do you know the law of entropy generation? The law of entropy generation. - Could you spell that out? - Jichong, let's eat. It's yours. Your book. I know. I know you have to pay rent. Will you take it easy? It's a fire safety rectification. There's nothing I can do about it. Why are you quitting now? I can't buy these ingredients. We both have it tough. Let's be understanding. Give me a few more days. Don't go. All right. Thank you. You… This way, please. This is where we do our live streams. Over here, each streamer has their own space. Look. This is a music live stream. Fitness. Food critic. Fashion. Beauty and makeup. Just a pretty face. What do you think? Have you considered signing with our MCN company? You can have a world of your own. We sought you out because you have an old video with viral potential. What viral potential? This? My restaurant is opening tomorrow. What a great persona you have. A single mature female with a dog. Sorry, I meant no offense. Look. You talked about your pre-entrepreneur days. It has reached 32,000 reposts. Your previous cooking videos only have a few hundred likes. So do you get it now? Get what? In the online world, telling a good story is far more important than cooking well. Let me put it this way. You're an older woman. - I'm only 30. - You quit your job. - I was laid off. - You gave up on your marriage. - I didn't. - Rejected love. - I didn't reject it. - Just hear me out, miss. You threw yourself into your work, devoting yourself to starting a business. What are you? A female protagonist, everybody's favorite these days. My restaurant keeps losing money. We might close down soon. The audience doesn't need to know this. However, miss, I have a foolproof plan for you. Considering your science background and your work in IT, I'm going to transform you into a food blogger who combines reason with emotion. In the early stages, we just visit places to accumulate views. I might need you to be a little snippy. Just be tough. Once your views go up, we will connect with brands. Forget it. I don't think I can do this. Wait, miss. Don't go yet. Let me show you something else. Let me show you this. Take a look at this first. This is our profit-sharing structure. Take a look. If your likes get to this level, the amount of money you can get is this number. If your likes get to this level, the amount of money you can get is this number. If your likes reach this level, the amount of money you can get is this number. But I don't know how to do this job. You're in luck. We have a scout blogger who will visit a very famous restaurant tomorrow. If you have the time, you can go with her. Treat it as practice. I'll think about it. Five, six, seven, go. Leg lift. Stand up. I can't dance to this. Open your left side. - Why am I in the middle? - Go here. Switch positions. Here, switch. You're on that side. The table part. The table. - Go. Get on the table, Fang Xin. - Is there a bend? That wriggle looks awful. How is it awful? Do you call that dancing? Didn't you say we could simplify it? Did I? No, the whole company will be watching. Put some heart into it. This is way too hard. I can't do it. Yes, maybe we should just do the easy one from middle school. The one with "Kiki, so so, - oui oui, non non... " - "Oui oui, non non... " How can something so trivial go on stage? Let's try this once more. Okay? Start from the table part. Go. Come down. All right. Let's do it again. Hurry up. Focus. Ready. Five, six, seven, eight. Roll your head. Hello. Ms. Zhang is still in Chengdu. We can meet and discuss. Of course. Does tomorrow at 2 p.m. work for you? Okay, thank you. See you tomorrow. Bye. Are you ready? -Yes. - All right. Let's do it again. -Liu Jing, put your phone away too. - Hold on. Shanmu posted on Moments that the shooting is wrapped up. But he hasn't contacted you yet. Forget it. Let's rehearse. If you're going to be like this, just go all the way. What do you mean? Like this. This looks a lot like you. Nice figure, right? Age. Don't say 30. Pick something younger. Twenty-five is a stretch. Do you really think so? Don't pick Aquarius. Aquarians are all drama queens. - But I'm an Aquarius. - I know. You can't put your real astrological sign. He will figure it out. Scorpio. Then what? Like this? SAVE PROFILE JIUMO, CANXI, KYLE, ZIJUN -This one is not bad. - There are so many. This one is good. Do they all edit their photos? - Why do they all have such good skin? - Look at that body. This one is hot. Someone sent you a message. XIANG DONGLIU "Let me see you?" Let's see you first. He doesn't look bad. He has stubble. All right. Let's find Shanmu. How? There's even a map. You can zoom out. - Shanmu is not around here. - Search for his hotel. His hotel is over here. RED SUN RESTAURANT "Shanyou…" Maybe he deleted the app but not his profile, so he still shows up. It's quite possible. He's not even online. We'll find out soon enough. I'm sorry. Be careful. SHANYOU MUXI Let's keep practicing. No more practice today. I feel a little tired too. No more practice? Well, I guess I'll go home. Liu Jing. Let's practice another day. XIANG DONGLIU DO YOU WANT TO MEET? You're back? Slowly. What is all this stuff? All must-buys for the baby. Is all this necessary? Of course it is. Look. You never know when you'll need this. I'm going to get some rest. AN INCREASE IN ENTROPY IS IRREVERSIBLE… RESEARCH UNSOLVED MASSACRE MUTUAL DISLIKE Lu Bin. Ms. Xia? Didn't you just tell me your name is Xia Meng? No worries. It doesn't matter what your real name is. I'll call you Xia Meng. Then I'll call you Xiang Dongliu. That's my real name. I can show you my ID. No need. Well, Xia Meng... Don't call me Xia Meng. Are you a chef? Why don't we go to the bedroom? I need to use the bathroom. Are you okay? I'm okay. Don't rush me. What on earth are you doing? Are you sure you're all right? Actually, I can tell that you're not in a good place. Maybe we should call it off. Why are you out here? What did you say? Why are you out here? I can't sleep. I didn't want to disturb you. Are you that little guy? Yes. Baili Shouyue. This character is called Baili Shouyue. I'm pretty good at this. How good? How good? Have you ever heard of bullet deviation? No. Let me put it this way. For a sniper, his point of aim and the actual trajectory are not the same. So we use this principle. Now watch. Just like this. Use this aiming line. Once the sidelines converge onto the center, then you shoot. Let me tell you. It's bullseye every time. Once more. Watch. Am I good? Zhang Ting, do you have to be so careful? Hello? We all miss you, Fang Xin. Come out for a drink. We miss you. Fang Xin is pregnant. She needs to rest. It's okay, Fang Xin. Next time. Bye. Go to bed early. Hello? So… you came to me today just to piss off your boyfriend. Do you really think he has done something just because he is on Haohao? I don't know if he has, but lying to me is wrong enough. He hurt me, so I hurt him. It might make me feel better. However, he doesn't know what you're doing. But I feel better now. If you do that, would you really feel better? I think I should go home. SHANMU, LET'S BREAK UP Hello, the subscriber you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. TRADITIONAL STEAMED BUN Honestly, I've never known the difference between mythical fantasy and martial arts genres. I think the latest one I saw must be a mythical fantasy show because it has two immortals in love. Was there a fight? Not really. Technically, that's a mythical idol show. What I'm working on now actually isn't mythical fantasy either. It's sci-fi mythical fantasy. What is sci-fi mythical fantasy? It's like the story I just told you with some additional sci-fi elements. The thing that puzzles me the most is that this comic book has no romance. How can we do a show without romance? The majority of our audience is female. I don't understand why every show has to have romance. Can't women live without love? I don't know if anyone else can, but you surely can't. You called us out here so early in the morning. Do you have anything to tell us? Or is there a follow-up to yesterday? No. I have things to do. I'm getting a cab. Give me a ride. I'll go with you. We're not done eating. Okay, I'll spill it. Shanmu and I are officially over. My meeting point is at the intersection. Let's walk there. Okay, I'll pack this and go with you. Don't you have anything to say to me? What use is it? Who knows if you will make up? Yes, if you make up, what we say here could be used against us later. One, it will offend Shanmu. Two, you'll say we're sowing discord. It won't happen. I've made up my mind. Don't say that. The fact that you want to talk about it means you haven't decided. When will you believe me? When the next one shows up. The cab is here. - Let's go. - Let's go. Liu Jing, when are you leaving? I'll finish eating first. Will you be okay on your own? Yes. She's not okay. I'll stay and eat with her. Go. - Okay, you stay with her. - Okay. Excuse me. - Liu Jing, don't overthink it. - Bye. TRADITIONAL STEAMED BUN After ten minutes, it's time for a showdown. KK, are you here to watch the game too? What are you doing here? I came to watch the game. Isn't this Jichong's ex-girlfriend? Ex-boss. - Hello. - Hello. It started. You're blocking me. You're blocking my view. - Stand up and watch. - This is incredible. They got in. - If you have to pick one, pick the dragon. - Yes. - Right? - I knew he'd be able to come forward. Right. I think this could be a great comeback opportunity. Yes, one just has to find his own role positioning. - That's right. - Right? - Role positioning is especially important. - Yes, I agree. Yes. I also think that role positioning is very important. The success or failure of a show... Here we go. KK, the casting department of our company is very good at what they do. Take the character Luo Kun for example. I have a couple of candidates. Be it their craft or social media... Wait a minute. What are you talking about? I know it's casting. Why are you suddenly talking about this? Do you know what we're talking about? Aren't you talking about casting? DEFEATED They were completely outplayed. - Yes. - I didn't think this was possible. What a show. - It's too good. - What are you talking about? You won't get it. You're not a gamer. I am. I love playing games now. Which character? What hero? What name? Tell us. Baili Shouyue. Are you good at aiming? Of course. Do you only know how to detect? Do you know what detecting means? Do you know what bullet deviation means? Aim with the red line, the blue lines converge, and bullseye every time. For real? If you're that good, maybe we can play together next time. Yes, help us gain some points. Sure thing. We can play together. KK, add her to our gaming group. Yes, add her. I don't have her WeChat. Add me now. Come on. Add her WeChat. What are you waiting for? Do it. We have lost many games, KK. Scan the QR code to make it a done deal. Don't be shy. -Just do it, KK. - You… -Got it? - Come, Xia Meng. Let me see. Hold on. I got it. I accepted it. We'll play together soon. You really will do anything for work. You? A gamer? Have you ever played a game? I have. Lu Bin taught me how to play. We do a lot of things together now. Do you want to know? No, thank you. How many times have I told you? There's too little soy sauce. That meat will be bland. It's okay, Mom. I'll take it from here. Go and get some rest. - Can you handle it? - Go and rest. Jingjing will help me. Come. Help me cook. I cook all day long. Can't I have a break? Exactly. Why are you asking her? She must be so tired managing the restaurant. Tired, my foot. Her restaurant has been shut down for days. Mom, I've told you. It's for fire safety rectification. It's not a shutdown. Also, a lot of people online are waiting for me to reopen. What kind of mom are you? - Jingjing, come. - Can't you encourage her? Mom, did you encourage me when I was a kid? All you did was criticize me. I learned it from you. That's ancient history. Of all the things you learned, why didn't you learn something good? You're so selfish. How useless. You… Here, Jingjing. Take this. No. What is this for? Keep the money for yourself. You have a restaurant now. It's hard starting your own business. It's not. The restaurant is going pretty well now. Don't worry. You can't hide it from me. Those videos about your startup that you posted on Scream, I've seen them all. Our little Jingjing has always been the smartest kid. Keep the money. Now, you're the best. Thank you, Grandpa. By the way, that braised pork you made on Scream, the one wrapped with leaves, must be delicious. I want to try it today. Today? Grandpa, I've been so tired these days. Also, it's a lot of work preparing those ingredients. How about this? Come to my restaurant with Grandma when you're feeling better. I'll make anything you want. Okay? Okay. Old man, take your medicine. Deal? It's a deal. I'm coming. Fang Xin, do you want to have a hot pot with us tonight? I have plans with friends tonight. Next time. It's 1:30 p.m. Let's get something to eat. Come on, Fang Xin. You guys can go ahead. I need a minute. Wait for me. A lot of new restaurants opened up downstairs. Let's check it out. Sure, let's see what kind of food there is. - What would you like to eat? - I want something healthy. Isn't it too late now? Don't we have a meeting with Tan Kexin's agent at 2 p.m.? It was canceled. I forgot to tell you. We ran into her agent at karaoke yesterday. It's done. - What about the publicity team? - They invited us to karaoke. Everybody happened to be there. Have they seen the samples? Do they have any comments? Yes, and they had a lot of comments. - I've summed it up like this. - Alice. Ms. Zhang. Let's use Plan A - I'll send it to you. - For the rundown of the opening ceremony. - Okay. - Fang Xin. Ms. Zhang. Fang Xin, you're new to the job but try to keep up with everyone as soon as possible. Don't make others spend time explaining everything to you again. Do you understand? Go have your lunch. Got it, Ms. Zhang. Just one round. I said I won't do it. You're asking me to lie. There are a lot of people online who try to get experts to help them by using a voice changer to pretend to be a girl. A voice changer? -Yes. - So it can change your voice. That's not the point. I'm trying to tell you that this is the most despised behavior in gaming. The one being fooled doesn't feel good either. How do you know? Have you experienced it? No. So you've helped other girls score points. Who did you help? Would you stop talking nonsense, Xia Meng? Well, if you can help other girls, why can't you help my friends? Anyway, I'm not going to help you. Do you remember Xiaomei? Yes. Why? She's having a baby soon. Do you know? Mr. Hu spoke to me today. Look at me. Mr. Hu spoke to me. He said if I don't get the IP this time, then one person in our department will have to go. I think it has to be Xiaomei. How can that happen? Xiaomei is pregnant. Yes, I know it's not reasonable, but since you won't help me, I think I should let her know so that she can be prepared. How do you quit this game? Let me be clear. I'll only play one round. Hold on. I'll let them know. KK, can you tell her to hurry? Is she chickening out? She sent a voice message. Okay. I'm ready. Everybody, get online. - Come on. - Come on. I want to see how good she is. Why is Xia Meng only a Bronze rank? Bronze? Why pretend to be an expert? I see you're only Bronze. What does that mean? They're saying your rank is too low. Of course it's low. I just registered. Wait a minute. They only have one Gold. The rest are Silver. What do you mean? Well, they aren't strong either. I saw your ranks are all too low, so I created a new account to play with you. - New account? -Don't be ungrateful. Test her. Show them what you've got. Go for it. Observer mode. Let's go. There are a lot of people. I'll take the lead. Come on. Go. I'll go first. Where are you guys? Why is Xia Meng on mute? Xia Meng. Unmute. Turn on the audio. They want the mic on. Turn it on. I'll talk. I'm here. Can you hear me? Tell them to come and start a group. Start a group. Come on. Angle. Get him. -Instant kill. - Instant kill. - Come on. - Assist me. Low HP. Quick, low HP. Checkup! - What? Checkup? - What? - Checkup. - What checkup? What checkup? Low HP. Low HP. Low HP. Don't you know what that is? Low HP! I've got a big move. Nice! They're not very good. Are you guys for real? You guys suck. -I can beat you guys with my feet. - We're doing our best. Okay, enough is enough. Talk less. - Steady. - It's okay. Keep going. Super move! KK! - KK, super move. - We're almost there. Super move! Super move. Do a super move. Come on. Super move, please! What was that? Who was that? Xia Meng? I'm here. That wasn't your voice. It was. Just now, I had the voice changer on. Seriously? What voice changer? A voice changer? Why did you turn on the voice changer? Because I'm a girl, people keep messaging me to add me on WeChat, meet up, and so on. To avoid all that, I started using a voice changer. Seriously? I actually have a voice changer too. -Let's do one more round. - Come on. Hey, Xia Meng. Let's do one more round. I have to go. Let's call it a day. I'm signing off. Bye. Xia Meng. KK just said that he'll sell you the rights. - Really? -Yes. I didn't say that. I really didn't say that. Let's stop playing. Look how much I do for Xiaomei. Just once. - I told you I hate... - You hate people lying to you. I know. There won't be a next time. AN INCREASE IN ENTROPY IS IRREVERSIBLE… THE SPRING RIVER Hello, reservation under Mr. Luo. Okay, let me see. You're here. Why are you here? I can't hear you. I'm busy. Table 1 and Table 3 don't want these three dishes from set menu 1. Are you following me? What? I asked if you were following me. I can't hear you. Wouldn't uroko-yaki be too greasy done Sichuan style? I said uroko-yaki. Uroko-yaki. Are you just pretending not to hear me? What a coincidence. You look very professional. Are you following me? - I came to eat. - I'm just joking. Look, in a bit... Can you check on Table 6's appetizers? Table 6, come on. Sorry, miss. No entering the kitchen. - Mention my name for the discount. - I'm sorry. Chef, I beg of you. Stop bringing girls into the kitchen. I beg of you. I'll leave you to work. Taste the yummy food. Avoid crappy food. Today, we're in Chengdu at a very prestigious fusion restaurant, The Spring River. Today, the chef has recommended six dishes. Let's start with the first one without further ado. This texture is mediocre for how expensive it is. I don't want to eat this. Next. I really don't recommend this. Later, let's shoot this first. You shoot the food. It's too sour. No, this is not good. It's inedible when it's baked like this. I'm not eating this. Well, for this meal, there were some highlights. However, at 700 yuan per person, I think it's outrageous. I really don't recommend it. If you really like food, check out my live stream at 8 p.m. tonight. I'll see you there. Cut. Look at the footage. - I'm so hungry. - Try the croquettes. And the ribs too. - They're amazing. - Really? Really. Yueyue, are you live streaming tonight? Yes. I used to own a restaurant. I can understand. The restaurant business is so tough now. No, my restaurant was actually doing pretty well. It's just that I love being a scout. I just love eating. I think it's most important to do what you love. Have you tried the ribs? They're amazing. Well, we're going. - Bye. - Bye. XIANG DONGLIU, THE SPRING RIVER Ms. Xia. See? My real name is Xiang Dongliu. Why do you have to be like this? I'm leaving. What is your real name anyway? Fang Xin. THE SPRING RIVER HERE ARE THE PICTURES Fang Xin said something came up, so she'll be late. Xia Meng. Let me tell you something. Do you remember the guy who texted me on Haohao? We met. Forget it. I'll wait until Fang Xin gets here. Anyways, we only met once and nothing happened. Come on. Let's drink. Thank you for your hard work. Fang Xin is here. - Fang Xin. - Hi, Fang Xin. Fang Xin, you're late. Three glasses as punishment. No drinking for pregnant women. - Sorry. Thank you. - Sorry. I forgot. I thought you said you weren't coming. I heard the food is great here. The shoot went well. Kexin is happy. You should go say hi. Thank you. Ms. Tan, sorry that I'm late. It's all good. You're here now. So what did you think of the samples? Can we just drink today and not talk about work? All drinks and no work today! - Okay! - Okay! Thank you, everybody. Next time, I'll bring you go… Fang Xin, the shrimp paste is especially good here. - Try it. - Here it is. - Okay. - Shrimp paste. - I... - I've checked. Pregnant women can eat shrimp. Thank you. Isn't it good? It's delicious. Have more. Okay. -Try this. It's good. - Okay. The car is coming. Go home and rest. I could actually go clubbing too. Don't joke. Your husband would kill me. Boyfriend. The car is here. - However... - Come on. Mind your head. - Bye. - Bye. Five, six, seven, eight. Raise your hands and lower them. Table move. Table move. Come on. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three. Get on the table. Look at that pretty girl. Yes. - All right. Then… - Five, six, seven, eight. -Open… - Fang Xin is here. Thank goodness. You're finally here. - They asked me to cover for you. - Look at you guys. Where were you? I just had dinner with my colleagues. Our collaborating artist was there, so I was a bit worried. What happened to your face? Allergies? - Again? - You were fine when you left. What happened? Maybe it's the seafood. Why did you have seafood? I'm going to get changed first. - Go. - Hold on, let me see. Xia Meng, I think we should call it a day. She's… It's fine. She gets allergies all the time. - Yes. - She has always been like this. But she's pregnant now. I'm so sorry. We have to go. You keep practicing. We have to go. See you. - Bye. - Bye. I hope Fang Xin is all right. She'll be all right. Let's get back to practice. - Let's continue. - Just the two of us? It's okay. Let's start from the position with our hands on the table. Ready. Five, six, seven. Hands. One, two, three. Liu Jing, don't be like this. Can you take this seriously? Please think about something besides love and romance. We're focusing on this now. Let's do this dance right, okay? Let's do it when we're all together. Why? I can't think about anything besides love and romance. Property management fixed the leak. Stop scratching, Fang Xin. Spit it out. Spit it out first. Come on, quick. Look. "If pregnant, use with caution." Bear with it for a moment. No, this has steroids. - You can't use it. - How do you know that? All ointments have steroids. - Where did you put it on? - But I'm really itchy. Here, pat it gently. Pat it gently. Look at you. You know you have allergies. Why did you eat seafood? Here, look up. - Gently now. - Do you think I wanted to eat it? It was because of special circumstances. It was all for work. Does dinner with colleagues count as work? What's more important, your health or your work? No. What I mean is, shouldn't you take better care of yourself? Fang Xin. Fang Xin. Watch out for the car. Why didn't you look before crossing? It's so dangerous. Enough, stop scratching. Endure it. I can't stand it. You have to. What if it gets infected? How many times have I told you? Your body is not your own right now. - You have to take care of... - Do you ever shut up? It's for your own good. What do you want me to do? I wish that you could disappear. Disappear! I was wrong. I'll stop. PCR report, please. Zhang Ting. I want to go alone. Wait for me outside. Enter. Enter. Hello, KK. Have you read the proposal yet? Let's not talk about that. Are you free to play Honor of Kings today? I'm kind of busy right now. Maybe later. Why don't you read the proposal first? I'll read it later. Let's play a round first. See you this afternoon. Bye. Are you still alive, Xia Meng? Just barely. You don't have to practice so hard. I'm worried sick. I wish I could help you. What? I thought you meant to help with your dance. Forget about the dance. The priority is playing Honor of Kings. It's going to end up being so many rounds. Just play a few rounds first. I'm not free today. I have to study. You know that. Lu Bin, I really need you right now. If I can't get this IP, I'll be on rocky ground with the company. Drop it, Xia Meng. It's not happening. There's no way I'm helping you. You… I'm not afraid to go in there, Lu Bin. Don't you hate it when people lie? You said you would help. Now you won't. Do you know, Lu Bin? You're really cute when you're gaming. Look, this is his head. This is a leg. He's growing so fast. Yes, fetal development during this period is rapid. Try to talk to him. See if he can flip over. Talk to him? That's right. The baby might respond. What should I say? It's up to you. Anything is fine. Hello? Hello, baby. Baby. Did it move? Yes. Did he really move? Can you take this out for me? This style is customizable. It's very special. Sorry. Hello? Where are you? I'm done. I'm at the mall nearby. I bought you food. Julie. -Send me the location. - What is it? -I'll come over. - Okay. There's something I want to tell you in person. Okay, I have a surprise for you too. Sir. You can't leave right now. Hello? What's happening there? - Excuse me. - Sorry, miss. You can't enter. - What's going on? - There's a confirmed case. We're screening now. - Thank you for cooperating. - Sorry. Hello, Zhang Ting. Where are you? Fang Xin, I'm sorry. An emergency situation came up. I went to a jewelry store. They said the store clerk got a positive test result. I'm considered a close contact. Don't worry. I'm fine. Be careful and stay safe. Let me know when you get home. Okay. All right. Don't worry. Bye. Also, the prenatal report... Are you done? I'm done. They're saying they want another round. Again? How many rounds has it been? I'm done. Just one more round. I'm not playing. Okay, fine. Can you ask them what they think of my proposal? - Why don't you ask yourself? - Please ask for me. You can ask on WeChat. They're still in the game. Quick. KK, what do you think of our proposal? My team actually thought it was pretty good. However, we need to think about it. You haven't given me a real answer yet. Which part of the story is your favorite? Can you tell me? Xia Meng, are you still there? It's probably Chapter 35. Yes, because when I read Chapter 35, I thought it was really surprising. It's a replay of Chapter 1, right? In that context, I think the good guys and bad guys had swapped roles. At that time, Luo Kun was really appealing to me. To be honest, he was even inspiring. I had the same thought. When writing Chapter 1, I already knew what would be in Chapter 35. Xia Meng, can you turn off your voice changer? Why? I want to hear your own voice. Okay, it's off. Go ahead. Some friends are coming over to the studio tomorrow night. Do you want to join us for a drink? Come on. I'm going to invite Jichong too. Is he going too? Would that make you uncomfortable? No. I'll go. Can I ask you a question? Why did you break up with him back then? I'm a better producer than he is and I'm much more capable than him. Do you understand? Not really. He actually has a good job right now. I wonder if you would reconsider him. Of course not. Why? Because I already have a boyfriend. What does your boyfriend do? Fitness training. Isn't that a bigger gap? It's none of your business. We'll talk tomorrow. I'm hanging up. He's crazy. He should mind his own business. Are you angry? No. Okay, that's good. Fang Xin. Ms. Zhang, did you want to see me? Fang Xin, do you ever get this feeling? You want both a career and a family. You try to do everything well, yet you often feel a sense of self-doubt. Yes. Then what about really wanting to fit in somewhere but often ending up feeling like an outsider? A bit. This is my son. He's cute, right? Yes. However, his teacher always criticizes me for not checking the parents' chat and not actively taking part in school activities. And the mommy group doesn't even invite me for tea anymore. - That's outrageous. - You know what it's like to be excluded? I'm lonely too. Fang Xin, do you think that we must choose between a career and a family? No. I think so too. What's wrong with wanting everything? I want both a career and a family. - What's wrong with that? - That's right. Can you understand me? I can understand. They have an arts and crafts project. It's due next week. It must be mailed back to Shanghai by Friday morning. You know how busy I am. I have a video conference with headquarters every night. So could you do me a favor and do it for me? Inside here are instructions on how to do it. These are pictures of me and my son. Thank you so much. The PR draft isn't… Fang Xin, the other parents know that I'm in the fashion business, so this display board has to be really perfect. Okay. Everybody in the administration department is dancing along. Are we being too cruel to Ms. Xia? Don't worry. She's used to it. Yes. It's Ms. Xia's turn. - Go, Ms. Xia! - Go, Ms. Xia! Shanmu came to see me during the day. And? - A big fight. I think we're breaking up. - Sing! Such hidden talent. Come closer, Fang Xin. Zhang Ting is in quarantine. Focus. Clap hands. He secretly went to buy a ring. The shop clerk might be infected. Why does everyone around you get quarantined? Be serious. A lot of people are watching below. Smile. He seems eager to get married. However, I haven't decided yet. If I had, I wouldn't have gone to Shanghai. True. Sing. She's going all out. They don't seem in sync. What should I tell my mom? What should I tell Zhang Ting? I need you two to stop talking. We're just in bad moods. Yes, that's why I wanted someone to talk it out with. What is there to talk about? You just got feelings for someone else. That's why it was so easy to split up. Would you be able to raise a child without Zhang Ting? So many people are watching. Can we be more professional? Our focus is just the annual party. Put everything else aside for now, okay? Why your party is important and our issues are not? Right. Don't think that the world revolves around you. Don't boss us around like you do with Lu Bin. - Yes. - Why are you bringing up Lu Bin again? - Didn't you bring up Zhang Ting? - You treat him like a nanny, - yet you find him annoying. - What are you saying? How do I treat him like a nanny? Every time we say something about you, you turn it around on us. - You don't know the whole story. - I do know everything. Did you do more with the Haohao guy than just meet up? Stop spinning, will you? Do you think I'm that kind of person? Liu Jing, when did you see the Haohao guy? - If that's true, then you're at fault. - That's enough. I'm not pretentious like you. - When am I pretentious? - Don't fight on stage. - You're pretentious. - Something is not right. Maybe it's a musical. Yes, this song is about a bunch of guilty women. So avant-garde. It's amazing. - Do we have to do this onstage? - Wasn't that what you wanted? You shut up. Fang Xin, what's wrong? Xia Meng, we're here to help you. Isn't it because we said friends help each other out? But do you think of us as friends? No offense, but don't think you're the center of the universe. Don't think you're always right. How about you? You have an opinion on everything but never say anything! You can't do anything right! Fang Xin, are you all right? Didn't you say I was pretentious? I did ask him to send it to me, but I don't know how he sent it to Ms. Zhang's group. I don't care. Ms. Zhang is very angry. Get them to rewrite it right now. Okay, I'll call him right away. Okay. I WENT OUT TO STUDY! You again? -I really don't recommend it. - Look at this person. Isn't that you? If you really like food, check out… I was there to observe. I didn't know they would be so harsh. Your restaurant is really very good. I know. I don't need to hear it from you. I understand you need to trash talk in those scouting videos. Otherwise, nobody will watch them, right? I'm not a scout. I'm a chef too. Are you a chef? What? Nothing. Cheers. I'm just curious. You use this app all the time. No, I don't use this all the time. Listen. What I mean is, have you ever thought about having a serious relationship? No. Why? What's the big deal? No reason. You must have a reason. What reason? Tell me. Tell me. - Do you really want to hear it? - Spit it out. A while ago, I was in a long-term relationship. I was still just an apprentice. She came from a well-off family. Her family wouldn't let us be together. However, she made a firm decision to be with me. The day before our wedding, she got in a car accident and she didn't make it. I shouldn't have asked. No, it's all right. I think my heart has no more room for anybody else. Do you know? When you like someone, fall in love with her, then lose her, it's really very painful. Can you understand? I can. Really? Yes. I can't even understand it. It was all made up. I was just kidding. I just don't want to be in a relationship. Why do I have to have an unforgettable romance? - What's your problem? - What's my problem? You have issues. Anybody who dates you will be miserable. If you date me, you'll be happy. Who wants to date you? Dream on. Your phone keeps vibrating. Pick it up. My mom is nagging me to go home. You're supposed to answer your family's calls. Please get us two more drinks. Hi, Mom. Mom, don't panic. What is it? Let's go. - Mom, put this on. - Is it so hard? Jingjing, that braised pork you made on Scream, the one wrapped with leaves, must be delicious. Do you know that the actor seriously didn't speak for two minutes? Xia Meng is here. The master has arrived. Come. You're so late. I thought you bailed. Sorry. I'm late. - Do you want some? - Get her a beer. -No, I already ate. - I got it. - Here. - I'm not drinking. - Have one. - Xia Meng, have a drink. Let's toast to the master, Xia Meng. - To the master. - Come on. To the king. KK, this is our revised proposal. We've added more details. Take a look. - I think you'll be happy with it. - I have some preliminary ideas. What preliminary ideas? - It's... - No more talking about work. We don't get together very often. Shouldn't we play a round? - Yes. - Come on, Xia Meng. - Wait up. - Wait a minute. - Let's play a round. - KK, I'm really in a rush. - This week, I have to... - You be the assist. - I'll play the jungler. - I'll play middle. - Xia Meng, get your phone. - Log in. I really need you to give me an answer. Let's play a round first. Then I'll tell you. - Okay? - Hurry, log in. - I don't want to play. - Come on. Log in. I'm just here to work. Why should I play games with you guys? Xia Meng. I didn't realize that you were so busy. I really thought you were here to hang out with us. Maybe we should talk over there. I'll be back. Xia Meng. You could've told me you didn't want to play. I don't know how to play at all. Previously, I asked my boyfriend to play with you guys. So was the one discussing the story yesterday also your boyfriend? I don't know how to communicate with you. Every time I talk to you about work, you talk about something else. How do I hold your attention besides gaming? I couldn't think of any other way, so that's all I could do. Or is it because I'm a girl, so you think I can't do this well? I don't think you're bad at your job. I gave your proposal a serious look. I think it's well-written. However, you also need to know that I'm a creator. I need to feel safe too. I want to get to know you better. Because I think if I can know you better, then I can trust you with my work. Stop arguing, you two. Xia Meng, I'm sorry. - I won't ask you to game anymore. Sorry. - We won't play. Sorry. I'm not in the right mindset today. I should go. Don't go. XIANG DONGLIU, THE SPRING RIVER I'm sorry. Thank you. No problem. The kitchen is ready. Ms. Fang, is your neck okay? It's okay. You don't have to call me Ms. Fang. My real name is Liu Jing. It won't change again later, will it? DIARY OF GROWTH I DON'T USUALLY BUY CANDY FOR… Alice, just give me a little more time. I'll make sure you get the perfect press release. Are you sure you want to write it yourself? All right. I emailed you the final photos. Once you're finished, don't forget to send it in the work chat. Okay, I know. Don't worry. MARRIAGE IS… MARRIAGE IS AN ADVENTURE… …in pursuit of happiness. MARRIAGE IS AN ADVENTURE IN PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS I'm so torn whether I want to keep my restaurant going or not. I can't hold on much longer. Give me some advice. Well, in the current environment, every restaurant has it tough. And being a chef is a physical job. As for you, as a female chef, during this journey, you must have faced even more challenges. I really don't have any advice for you. Try it. How is it? It's… surprisingly good. You don't have to tell me. I know. Give me a few more years and I can definitely be better than you. Have some yourself. I think it should go with some rice. Why aren't you at the hotel? I can't concentrate at the hotel. I thought you don't eat these high-calorie foods. Yes. But I just can't read anymore. If I don't eat some of this stuff… Do you think I'm annoying? Well, a bit. Then why do you like me? Do you sometimes feel that, compared to you, I'm a bit useless? Sometimes. A little bit. Then why do you like me? See? Liking someone can't be explained. Didn't you say it before? Let's just be ourselves. Don't mind what others think. I think I'm a pretty self-centered person. Every time something goes wrong, I blame the people around me. However, they are all just excuses for myself. I don't put in enough effort and when problems arise, I blame others. I really hate this part of myself. I think it happens to everyone. Did you know that I was an athlete when I was a kid? I used to be a sprinter. I always thought if I could make the national team one day, that would've been awesome. However, during one competition, I suffered a ligament injury, the kind you can't recover from. Because I couldn't become an athlete, I switched to sports rehabilitation. Don't you think I have it worse than you? What the heck? Xia Meng, failure doesn't matter. The important thing is to persist. Look at me now. I'm still fighting. Well, then you'd better pass the test. I don't find you annoying at all. However, sometimes, I really do think you're a bit useless. Lu Bin. Would it be weird if I kissed you right now? Yes. A little bit. TAN KEXIN PRESS RELEASE FINAL DRAFT SEND SENT GO TO BED EARLY TODAY. ARE YOU SLEEPING YET? GO TO BED EARLY TODAY. ARE YOU SLEEPING YET? ZHANG TING Are you still up? I just finished working. This isn't going to work. Can you physically handle it? It's so exhausting. Yes, it's hard. However, I also think that I really like this job. Yes, I know. Did you get everything? Yes, I have everything now. It's a special circumstance. I'll stick it out. Is there something that you want to tell me? Go ahead. I'm listening. Zhang Ting, I want to reconsider getting married. I want to take it slowly at my own pace. What… Why? Did I do something wrong? Tell me and I can change. No, you didn't. Then why? You're already pregnant, so I... Yes, I'm pregnant. So you proposing and me marrying you, all seem so natural. But what if I weren't pregnant? That's not what I meant. I'm not with you just because you're pregnant. It's just the fact that we... I know. Look. My last marriage was a total failure. I know that your last marriage caused you a lot of pain, but you have to know that I'm not your ex-husband. - Yes. -I'm not going to hurt you, you know? Yes, but at that time... I think you should have faith in our future. I'm sorry. I… To be honest, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I can't do anything right these days. However… However, I really want to be with you. So I want to know. Do you still like me? Yes. It's just that we've only been together for a few months. We don't know each other well enough to get married. It's not that I don't want to marry you, but I really need time to think about it and find the answer. Okay, let's not talk about it. You should go to bed soon. You have work tomorrow. ANALYSIS REPORT OF COMIC-TO-FILM ADAPTATION OF NIRVANA ADAPTATION IDEA EXAMPLES MOBIUS CUP, ONE-ELECTRON UNIVERSE THIS IS MY REVISED ANALYSIS REPORT THREE DELICIOUS BESTIES LIU JING, LISTEN TO THE SONG. YOU ALWAYS LOSE THE BEAT. Why don't we make a rule? If we ever have a fight, everyone has to say what she did wrong. Don't always blame others. Why don't we do the routine we did in middle school? The one with "Kiki, so so, oui oui, non non." DO YOU REMEMBER OUR DANCE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL? What's with the sunglasses at night? Can't you tell that I'm having an allergic reaction? That looks serious. Give me some. I'm allergic. Ms. Xia, you're finally here. As usual, I go first. I'm too self-important. I always like to impose my will onto others... I want to change the rules. It's too easy to criticize someone these days, so I don't want to hear any self-criticism here. Xia Meng, even though you're aggressive, you aren't selfish. To have an assertive friend like you, I feel very lucky. Because no matter what difficulties Liu Jing and I encounter, you'll always get yourself involved. Fang Xin. I really don't think you're pretentious. On the contrary, you have the most inner strength of us all. So you don't need to arm yourself with a strong appearance. That's what I think is the most amazing thing about you. It's your turn. Well, you always hesitate and drag your feet and never know what you really want. Is that it? However, I know you want to experience things your own way before forming your own judgment. Also, you have to remember, whatever choices you make, we will support you unconditionally. Ms. Xia used to dress more conservatively. Love makes one confident. Ms. Xia! Ms. Xia! We did it. Ms. Xia, we love you! What's going on? The IT department? Finance? Marketing. This is crazy. We can at least beat Logistics. Come on. Don't lose. Why is everybody in your company suddenly a pro dancer? Go hard or go home. Here they come. Don't panic. Hold it together. But I'm so scared. Scared of what? Smile! -Three besties, one heart! - Three besties, one heart! -Girl power. Break a leg! - Girl power. Break a leg! Yang! Go! Hello, KK. I received your adaptation proposal. I think you did a great job, so I've decided to give you the rights to Nirvana. Really? Really. Thank you so much. I look forward to our collaboration. Bye. I got it. - I know. I heard you. - I got it. Our team will be doomed. - Ms. Xia. - What are you guys talking about? Nothing. Ms. Xia, why are you so happy? You know why. The HR reshuffle is not news. Ms. Xia, I bet you don't know that Jichong is returning. Wang Jichong? Why is he coming back? Well, he's taking over Mr. Hu's position. NATURAL CHILDBIRTH, TIME ELAPSED Do you feel anything?
