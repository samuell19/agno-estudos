In order to show you... how a big symphony orchestra is put together... Benjamin Britten has Written a big piece of music... which is made up of smaller pieces... that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra. These smaller pieces are called variations... which means different ways of playing the same tune. First of all, he lets us hear the tune, or the theme... which is a beautiful melody by the much older British composer Henry Purcell. Here is Purcell's theme played by the whole orchestra together. Now Mr. Britten lets you hear... the four different families of the orchestra... playing the same Purcell theme in different ways. First we hear the woodwind family: the flutes, the oboes, the clarinets, and the bassoons. Here comes the brass family: the trumpets, the horns... the trombones, and the tuba. One to four. Now Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme for the string family." - I'm sick of this rain. - the violins, the violas... the cellos and the double basses. And of course, the harp. And finally the percussion family: all those drums and gongs and things you hit. After this, you will hear the theme by Purcell... played once more in its original form... by all four families together: that is, the whole orchestra. This is the island of New Penzance - sixteen miles long... forested with old-growth pine and maple... crisscrossed by shallow tidal creeks. Chickchaw territory. There are no paved roads, but - here comes Jed with the mail - but instead, many miles of intersecting footpaths and dirt trails... and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound... famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm... which will strike from the east on the 5th of September... in three days' time. - Morning, Gadge. - Morning, sir. Deluca, latrine inspection. Good. Roosevelt, how's that lanyard coming? Horrible. - Skotak, what's all this lumber for? - We're building a tree house. - Where? - Right here. That's not a safe altitude. Why is it up so high? If someone falls from there, that's a guaranteed death. Where would you have built it? Lower. - Nickleby, what are you doing? - Pest control. Burning some ants. Spot check. Your socks are down, your shirttails are untucked, your trousers are not properly pressed. You are reported for a uniform violation. - How many rockets you up to, Panagle? - 16 1/2, sir. Enough for the Hullabaloo? Izod, fetch another pint of gunpowder from the armory shed. Redford, I saw that! - How fast were you going? - Safety test, sir. - Come again? - The vehicle appears to be in good working order. I'm just checking - Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next time I take away the keys. Good morning, chef. Who's missing? Who's missing? - Shakusky. - Shakusky. - Shakusky. - Shakusky, yeah. Shakusky! Breakfast! Shakusky, you in there? Sam? It's zipped from the inside. Jiminy Cricket! He flew the coop! ♪ Take these chains from my heart ♪ ♪ And set me free ♪ Hello, this is Captain Sharp. Over. Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over. Morning, Randy. What can I do for you? Over. I'm not sure exactly. I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over. What does that mean? Over. One of my boys seems to have stolen a miniature canoe and fishing tackle... ten pounds of sundries, two bedrolls, plus an air rifle... and disappeared. Over. - Any idea why? Over. - No. He left me a letter of resignation. Over. Dear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad to inform you... I can no longer be involved with the Khaki Scouts of North America. The rest of the troop will probably be glad to hear this. It is not your fault. Best wishes, Sam Shakusky. Well, I guess we'd better notify his folks. Over. Okay. Over and out. - Hello, Diane. - Becky, I have your person-to-person from Chesterfield. Hold the line, please. Hello? Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp. Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank you very much. In fact, we've come to a decision as a family... because this is only the most recent incident involving Sam's troubles... and it's just not fair to the others, so unfortunately... we can't invite him back at this time. There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll find him. We're simply notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on. I understand that. I'm notifying you of the situation on my end. I'm confused by that statement. You can't invite him back? I'm afraid not. He's a good boy. He's got a good heart. But it's just not fair to the others, see? He's emotionally disturbed. Am I speaking with Sam's father? No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's been with us since last June. Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward speaking. Are you implying Sam is an orphan? It's a known fact. Of course he is. Why the hell doesn't it say so in the register? Excuse my language. I don't know. What register? We sent him a letter. It should reach you presently. Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. We are notifying you as a matter of protocol. You say you can't invite him back? You say he's an orphan? I don't understand how that works. What am I supposed to do with him? That's up to Social Services. They'll be in touch with you. They'll look after Sam. Good luck to you. You have your orders. Use the orienteering... and pathfinding skills you've been practicing all summer. Let's find our man, bring him safely back to camp. Remember, this isn't just a search party. It's a chance to do some first-class scouting. Any questions? Lazy-Eye? - What's your real job, sir? - Math teacher. Why? - What grade? - Eighth. - You need a PhD? - No, but you know what? We're in the middle of something, in case you didn't notice. One of our scouts is missing. That's a crisis. Anybody else? Redford? - What if he resists? - Who? Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force? No, you're not. This is a nonviolent rescue operation. Your mission is to find him, not to hurt him under any circumstances. - Am I making myself understood? - Yes. Good. I'm gonna change my answer. This is my real job: Scout Master, Troop 55. I'm a math teacher on the side. Be leery out there, okay? Let's get started. - Who's got Snoopy? - Right here. Give him the scent. I heard he ran away because his family died. - I heard he never had any family. - That's probably why he's crazy. If we find him, I'm not gonna be the one who forgot to bring a weapon. Me neither. Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across the other side of the island. You think a 12-year-old boy could row this far in a miniature canoe? - Most likely not. - It is possible, Counselor. I disagree, Counselor. It'd take three days at least. - I don't think so. Two, maximum. - I'm not gonna argue about it. - Will you let me know if you see anything unusual? - Yeah. Scout master's log, September 2nd. First day of search party for Sam Shakusky. Morale is extremely low - in part, I suppose... because Sam is the least popular scout in the troop... by a significant margin. I'm confused, and I'm worried. Please let us find him tomorrow. Please don't let him fall off a cliff... or drown in a goddamn lake or something. A terrible day at Camp Ivanhoe.

Is that a cat in there? - Can you read a map? - Uh-huh. I do cartography. I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow... since you're a less experienced hiker and wearing Sunday-school shoes. - They're not really Sunday-school shoes. - Here. Oh, thank you. Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by 1600, which means 4:00. - How's that sound? - Fine. - You want some beef jerky? - Okay. Let's go. - Are you thirsty? - No, thank you. If your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. - You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly. - Mm-hmm. Sometimes I stick leaves on my hair. It helps cool your head down. That's a good idea. It might also help if you didn't wear a fur hat. Yeah. True. You can go ahead. Be careful. Here's a trick: Throw pine needles in the air... and you can see which direction the wind is blowing. - Which way? - Um - I guess it doesn't really matter, just as long as we cover our tracks. You smell like perfume. Oh, it's my mother's. Hmm. Hmm. I brought water too. - You wait here. - Okay. I'll be right back. Watch your head! Where the hell is it? Found it! It's ready. He knows someone's watching him. I agree. Wait. Why do you say that? Hmm. I don't know. I just think he can feel us. Follow me. - How strong a swimmer are you? - Pretty good. I broke our school record for the backstroke. Okay. I'm not that strong of a swimmer... so I wear a life preserver. Watch out for turtles. They'll bite if you put your fingers in their mouths. - Okay. - Let me see if I can catch this one. Feel something. Aha. Hmm. Somebody wrote on him. The stick's - The stick's moving! You got one! Fish on hook! Reel him in slowly. Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you? I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for. Anyway, I used to be. Maybe we could feed your cat the guts and eyeballs. That's okay. He only eats kitten food. Oh. What else did you bring? Maybe we can make an inventory. Oh, okay. Go ahead. This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. - Do you like music? - Yeah. This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France. These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them... either in kingdoms on Earth or on foreign planets. Usually I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring them all. It got too heavy. - You can borrow any you want. - Thank you. I also brought... my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed... some rubber bands, extra batteries... - my toothbrush, and my binoculars, as you know. - Yeah. I forgot my comb, but I'll use my fingers. Hmm. Hmm? Wait. These are all library books. In my school, you're only allowed to check out one at a time. Some of these are gonna be overdue. Do you steal? Why? You're not poor. I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. It makes me feel in a better mood sometimes. Are you depressed? - How come? - I can show you an example if you'd like... but it doesn't make me feel very good. Anyway, I found this... on top of our refrigerator. Does that mean you? I think so. Are you laughing? It's not funny. You really know how to make friends. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. I'm on your side. I know. Thank you. Which one's the best? “His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins... Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface... of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. 'My people once were led by a great and noble beast... and I no longer see his face in this reflection.” “Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war.” Suzy, dinner. I'm not gonna say it again. - Where's your sister? - I don't know... but she borrowed my record player for 10 days without asking. What does that mean? Dear Lionel, I need to use your record player. - I will give it back in 10 days or less. - Do not tell morn. I will replace the batteries when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop. - Walt, where the hell are you? - Right here. Why are you cursing at me? Does it concern you that your daughter has run away? - That's a loaded question. - Come down and read this. Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no luck - Who's there? Good evening. Sorry to startle you. What are you doing here? Nobody called the police. I know. Uh, I know. The search party's not over yet - Suzy's missing too. Go find her. The tropical cyclone, which originated last week... off the coast of British Honduras, has intensified rapidly... and is now designated Hurricane Maybeline. Stay tuned for further information. How can we help her? She's got so many problems. It's getting worse. - Whose fault is it? - I don't know. But just for the record, 95% of all runaways... return home within the first six hours. Doesn't do you any good night now. It's just a statistic. But Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house... playing Chinese checkers at this very moment. She doesn't have any friends. How's Laura? - “How's Laura”? - Mrs. Bishop, I mean. I don't understand. Is she upset? ♪ Kaw-Liga ♪ ♪ Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian ♪ - ♪ Standing by the door." - There's a porcupine. ♪ He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store ♪ ♪ Poor old Kaw-Liga He never got a - ♪ She has a pen pal! It's very intimate. They planned this together. “Sam Shakusky”? That's my escaped Khaki Scout. His family died. Holy Christ, what am I looking at? He does watercolors. Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes. - Did she sit for this? - What's he say? Dear Suzy, you have a superb voice. You were my favorite animal in the program by far. Please find enclosed - Dear Sam, thank you very much. I got replaced as the raven because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn. After that, I was a blue jay - Dear Suzy, I'm sorry that your brothers are so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of it. Some times people do things without knowing the reasons - Dear Sam, you are an excellent painter, especially trees and telephone poles. Is the girl in the water supposed to be me? My favorite color is - Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire while I was sleepwalking. I have no memory of this, but my foster parents think I am lying. Unfortunately - Dear Sam, I am in trouble again. I threw a rock through the window. My mother still has glass in her hair. Dear Suzy, I have been trying hard to make friends... but I feel people do not' like my personality. In fact, I can understand why they - Dear Sam, I am getting suspended. I got in a fight with Molly. She says I go berserk. Our principal is against me. Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your feelings, but they still love you. That is more important. Dear Sam, I think you should think... of their faces every day, even if it makes you sad. It is too bad they did not leave you more pictures. Dear Suzy, here is my plan. Dear Sam, my answer is yes. - Dear Suzy, when? - Dear Sam, where? Dear Suzy, walk 400 yards due north from your house... to the dirt path which has not got any name... turn right, and follow to the end. I will meet you in the meadow. Gee whiz, what do you suppose happened to him? I'm not sure. I think he went searching in the dark. She stole the batteries out of my flashlight. Stole the batteries out of the flashlight. - I think he's on to us. - Of course he is. - “Of course he is”? - Of course he is. Then why aren't we worried about that? - I am. - Well, I didn't know. Or anyway, I thought maybe I was wrong. - Did you hit him? - No. He fell in a ditch. Hey! Cat food! I think it's a clue! That's her. Where is he going? I don't know. All right, we know they're together. We know they're within a certain radius of this spot. I'm declaring a case with the county right now. Until help arrives, I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one... and the boy with the patch on his eye to come with me. Randy, head upriver with the rest of your troops. Split up on foot. Becky, call Jed. Tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low. - Is it them? - Yeah. They found the campfire. Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. Be careful. What do you creeps want? We're looking for you. Why? - Because you're a fugitive. - No, I'm not. I quit the Khaki Scouts. It doesn't matter anyway. You don't have that authority. We've been deputized. Now, you're gonna come along peacefully or not. Listen to some reason. I don't like you. You don't like me. So why don't you just let us disappear? It's tempting, but we can't allow it. You shouldn't be friends with him. Why not? Because he's crazy. Maybe you just don't know him. We know him better than you. He's emotionally disturbed because his family died. Nickleby, tie him up. Do not... cross... this... stick. You're doomed, Shakusky. Molly's right. I do go berserk. It was him or us. Oh, no. She stabbed Redford in the back with lefty scissors! Repeat that, please? Over. Puncture wound, lower lumbar. Make room for a stretcher. You're gonna be okay. Thank goodness she missed the artery. Here, bite on this. He dodged my tomahawk. He's got excellent marksmanship. Shot Deluca in both arms. - I guess we're gonna miss the Hullabaloo. - Where's Snoopy? Those sons of bitches. They got him right through the neck. Was he a good dog? Who's to say? But he didn't deserve to die. - What happened? Who is that? - Clear the dock, Edgar! - Why's he bleeding? - Is Suzy with you? - No, she's with Shakusky. - Where am I going? The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be right behind you. - You got it? - Yep. - Warm up the motor. I'll be back. - Hold it right there! You're not leaving this island. Our daughter has been abducted... by one of these beige lunatics. Walt, it's very clear. The two of them conspired in this together. Don't worry. She'll be safe. Sam's got excellent wilderness skills. Why can't you control your scouts? I'm try- I'm trying. - Whoa, hey! Stop it! - Stop it! - Stop it! - I do blame him. But I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect... you can't let your children stab people. What are you talking about? She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. It's assault. Are you a lawyer? - No. - Well, we are! Take your hands off my wife! Excuse me. Excuse me, Captain Sharp! As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography accomplishment button. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest... in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea... of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration. What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going. ...on to the birdhouse... Where e very kind of bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling around. This is our land! Yes, it is! Run! Let's jump! - On three! - One, two, three! Now Saint-Saéns turns... to a very peculiar animal indeed called “the pianist.” Any of you who have ever had to sweat through piano exercises... will sympathize with these animals, I'm sure. I like it here, but I don't like the name. Me neither. “Mile 3.25 Tidal lnlet” - it's got no ring to it. Let's change it. What should it be? Let me think for a minute. I made you some jewelry. Are your ears pierced? The piece is played... by a greatly gifted young lady of 20, Miss Paula Robeson. It's pretty. Do the other one. Why do you always use binoculars? Mmm... it helps me see things closer, even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power. Hmm. That sounds like poetry. Poems don't always have to rhyme. They're just supposed to be creative. So, what do you want to be when you grow up? I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you? Go on adventures too. Not get stuck too. Anyway, we can't predict the exact future. That's true. It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way... later. Okay. I wish I didn't have to mention it, but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended. Of course I won't. - What's that one for? - This? Yeah. It's not an accomplishment button. I inherited it from my mother. It's not meant for a male, but I don't give a damn. Are your foster parents still mad at you for getting in trouble so much? I don't think so. We're starting to get to know each other better. I feel we're in a real family now. Not like yours, but similar to one. I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special. I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about. I love you too. - I got sand in my mouth. - Oh. Can you French-kiss? I think so. ls there any secret to it? The tongues touch each other. Okay, let's try it. It feels hard. Do you mind? I like it. Tilt your head sideways. You can touch my chest. I - I think they're gonna grow more. “The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic... and settled on a gap in the baseboard. A mouse hole, no bigger than a pocket watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. 'It's windy, ' he said, 'like someone in there is blowing on my fingers.' Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. 'He's right again, ' she thought. 'Little brothers drive people crazy.”' I'm listening. Read on. “Part two.” Dear Sam, it saddens me to write this letter... but Mrs. Billingsley and I have decided we cannot permit you to return to our home. I know you mean well. Do trust me: This is for the best. Godspeed, Herbert Billingsley. Be advised: The two of you will never see each other again. Those were your last words. Do you understand? I'd be careful if I were you. One of these days, somebody's gonna get pushed too far... and who knows what they're capable of? - Is that a threat? - It's a warning. You're a traitor to our family. Good. I want to be. I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your situation. It wasn't in the register. How'd you lose your parents? Never mind. I - I don't need to ask about that. I wish we'd had time to do an inspection back there... on the beach. I would have given you a “commendable.” That was one of the best-pitched campsites I've ever seen. - Honestly. - Thank you. You don't want to be a Khaki Scout anymore? Hello, Becky? Judy, I have your person-to-person from New Penzance. Go ahead, New Penzance. - This is Captain Sharp. - Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference... to Sam Shakusky, ward of the state. - I understand he's in your custody. - That's correct. What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury... or trauma of any kind? - He's fine. - Very good. - How do I get to you? - The fastest way would be seaplane. Jed can bring you. I'll come tomorrow morning. Is someone able to provide care and nourishment for the boy until that time? Uh-huh. - Is that a yes? - Uh-huh. - Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day. - Wait a second. - Yes? - Social Services? Captain Sharp? What's gonna happen to him? Normally we try to place him in another foster home... but that option's no longer available, in my opinion, due to his case history... which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge. What does that mean? Is that an orphanage? - Who's speaking? - This is Scout Master Randy Ward. Right, an orphanage. But the first step is, the admissions panel... requires a psychological evaluation to determine... whether the boy is a candidate for institutional treatment... or electroshock therapy. Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that be called for? He's not violent. The report describes an assault with scissors. - That was the girl! - The girl did that! Well, maybe she needs help too... but that's not our job. Okay? Okay. I'll be out back. I'm going to find a tree to chop down. I do know what you're feeling, Suzy bean. I've had moments myself where I say... “What am I doing here? Who made this decision? How could I allow myself to do something so stupid... and why is it still happening?” We women are more emotional - I hate you. - Don't say “hate.” - Why not? I mean it. You think you mean it in this moment. You're trying to hurt me. Exactly. I know what you do with that sad, dumb policeman. He's not dumb. But I guess he is kind of sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that. It's not appropriate for me... to even acknowledge what I already just said. Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for you? We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that? Oh, my God. How are we gonna get these fish hooks out? I admit we knew we 'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we ran away anyway. But something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other... something happened to us. That's very eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying. But then again, I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old. Look, let's face it. You're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it. But even smart kids stick their finger in electrical sockets sometimes. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: All mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from making... the dangerous ones, if we can. You want a slug? What's your rush? You got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean. Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor. - So are you. - That's true. Did you love someone ever? Yes, I did. What happened? She didn't love me back. Ah. I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what you're supposed to say. Scout master's log, September 4th. I heard he's going to reform school. I heard they're gonna take out a piece of his brain, send him to an asylum. - I like his girl. - She's too scruffy. - Supposedly they got to third base. - He just felt her up. Over shirt or under shirt? Damn us! It's none of our business. This troop has been very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a bunch of mean jerks! Why is he so unpopular? I admit, supposedly he's emotionally disturbed... but he's also a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel? Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye? Gadge? He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs our help. Are we man enough to give that... so part of his brain doesn't get removed? They were prepared to die for each other out there. Okay. Okay. What do you need? For starters, chicken wire... newspapers, and a bucket of wheat paste. In other words, it's over. I guess so. For the moment. Until further notice? - That's right. - I understand. I have to do better, for everybody. Except me. Except you. Well, I hope you can. I think you will. You're doing the right thing. Who knows what's gonna happen, Duffy? I'll probably see you tomorrow. Shh! Get out of my chimney. Listen to me. We're here for friendship. - We're gonna get you off this island. - No, thanks. Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue. It's worthless to me. There's no point, not without Suzy. How'd you get here? They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a dummy in my bed. Hmm. Diversion tactics. Good thinking. Where are we going? Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs... the supply and resources outpost for the Hullabaloo. He's a Falcon Scout, Legionnaire. Cousin Ben will know what to do. - Can we trust him? - Normally, I'd say no. Did you leave another note for Lionel? Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. - Besides, I'll probably never see him again. - True. This is the island of St. Jack Wood... extending far north from Land's End along the deepwater channel... that leads to Broken Rock. A low floodplain separates the beach from the township above... a small but prosperous community. The barometer reads 28 inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see. Already at 22 knots. The time is now 4:35 a.m. Did you file the motion for continuance? Peabody v. Henderson? - It was sustained. - Good. Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers v. Yentob? - He granted it. - Great. I'm sorry, Walt. It's not your fault. Which injuries are you apologizing for, specifically? Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt. Half of those were self-inflicted. I hope the roof flies off... and I get sucked up into space. You'll be better off without me. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Why? We're all they've got, Walt. That's not enough. “'But I'm not going, ' said Barnaby Jack. I'm running away tonight for good... and this time I won't get caught.' Annabelle whispered, 'I'm coming with you.' Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it... the size of a jellybean. 'Hide this in your socks and be ready at midnight.”' Continue. Keep going. Go on. We're listening. That's good. “He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow.” Where's my record player? Mom! You're not gonna believe this one, sir. That scout master on New Penzance... has now lost his entire troop. Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo? Couldn't say, sir. I'll be right back. There's a broken gumball machine behind the snack tent. I don't care how they do it where you come from. You want pop? Candy? A snakebite kit? Get some money. Cousin Ben? Come back in five minutes. Is this him? Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned. He's hot - almost too hot. What's in the can? - $76, mostly in nickels. - Give it to me. - You badge in seamanship? - Yes, sir. There's a coldwater crabber moored off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me. We'll see if he can take you on. It won't be easy, but it's better than shock therapy. Thank you, sir. Where's the chapel tent? Back there, but the padre's home with mumps. Why? I want to bring my wife. - But we're not married yet. - You his girl? Yes. Technically, I'm a civil law scrivener. I'm authorized to declare births, deaths, and marriages. You're kind of young. You got a license? No. I can't offer you a legally binding union. It won't hold up in the state, county... or courtroom due to your age, lack of a license... and failure to get parental consent. But the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves. You can't enter into this lightly. Look into my eyes. - Do you love each other? - Yes. Think about what I'm saying. Are you sure you're ready? - Yes. - They're not listening. Let me rephrase. - We're in a hurry. - Are you chewing - Spit out the gum, sister. In fact, everybody. I don't like the snappy attitude. This is the most important decision in your lives. Go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer. - We're sure. - Okay, let's do a blood test. ...under the eye of God and within the boundaries of this local jurisdiction... which we hereby consecrate on this day, the 5th of September, 1965. That's the end of the short form. Any witnesses have objections or remarks? Usually they don't. Skotak? Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried about their future. - That's my fee. - What do you think? - I don't know. - What'd I just say? I'm keeping the nickels. Okay, they can have the tennis ball can. Sign here. Initial here and here. Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's go. Where are they going again? He's gonna work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly. - I wish them well. - Me too. - Me too. - I think they're coming back. - Be quick, sailor! - What happened? She left her binoculars in the chapel tent. - Just leave 'em. - We can't! It's her magic power! You killed your dog, by the way. - Snoopy? - Mm-hmm. Well, it couldn't be helped. Why do you consider me your enemy? Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors. She's my wife now. Congratulations. Thank you. But before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. Why don't you like me? Why should I? Nobody else does. Ow! Ow! Ow! He's here! The fugitive! Stop him! Stop him! On this spot, I'll fight no more forever. Come and get me, you bastards! I'm okay. Follow me. Company, let's go! We've located the missing troop. They just fled camp. We're in pursuit. They're accompanied by a 12-year-old girl... in knee socks and Sunday-school shoes. Stand by, Commander Pierce. Jed, reroute to St. Jack Wood. Tell Social Services the boy's at Fort Lebanon. - Roger that. - Notify the Bishops that Suzy's there. - Randy, you monitoring? - Affirmative. I'm on my way. - Hello? - Mr. Bishop? Oh, dear God. Get the boys! Let's go! Right now! Tower control, this is Jed. Confirm coordinates... for new destination - alpha two-two-seven-one-fiver. Looking pretty soupy up here. Wouldn't mind setting down before the pot boils over. Hang on, Social Services. Storm waters have just breached the dam at Black Beacon Reservoir. A flash-flood alert is in effect. Take immediate precautions. That's coming our way. Did you find them? Prepare to mobilize to higher ground. St. Jack Church is the designated storm shelter. Notify all scouts to muster outside my tent on the double. Attention, company! Prepare for emer- Who's that? You call yourself a Khaki Scout? Sorry, sir? Where's your goddamn troop, you son of a bitch? - You don't have 'em? - They could get killed out there! I'm field-stripping you of your command. Attention, company! Prepare for emergency evacuation! Sir, do you have your medicine? I'll be right back. Hold your positions! Company Secretary, status report? All accounted for, Scout Master! Boys, we're gonna make a run for it! Fall in. Let's move! Come on, follow me! Who's in charge here? - Randy, what happened? - Take the commander off me! Suzy? Suzy? - Sam? - They ran away again. We got to go back out there. I need volunteers. You, you, and you. - You? - Are you all right? Of course I am. - Where's the boy? - We don't know yet. - That's not acceptable. - What do you want me to say, lady? Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee. - You're Captain Sharp. - Correct. I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy into your personal custody. You're responsible for his safety. I'm told he's just been struck by lightning. - That's the first I've heard of it. - It's true. - Scout Master Ward, I presume. - Yes, ma'am. Your reputation precedes you. You two are the most appallingly... incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had... the misfortune to encounter in a 27-year career! What do you have to say for yourselves? You can't do this. They'll eat him alive in there. - Where? - What's the name of the place again? - Juvenile Refuge. - Juvenile Refuge. Sounds like jail. Just find the boy... and deliver him to Social Services. Nothing else is in your power. - Can we get back to the rescue now? - Suzy is still out there. - Who are you? Walt and Laura Bishop. Their daughter's the missing girl. - The parents of the stabber? - I object. She was attacked! Excuse me. I want the details about that. - Where's the scout she knifed? - Right here. - Field Mate Redford, sir. - What's his condition? He may suffer some limited kidney insufficiency. Here's the report. - We don't have time for that! - She's right. - Let's go. - Stop! Nobody's going anywhere. He's not getting shock therapy. That's it! I am citing you for gross misconduct. - You are hereby summoned to appear - I'm writing you up back! You stand accused of mistreatment - - What are you talking about? - I won't let you do it! Look! - They're gone. - Who? - Suzy? - Sam! - They're here? - Where'd they go? Answer me! Halt! Stop! Stay there. Wait! Take these! Where are you going? What are you doing? Come down! Social Services, do you read me? Over. We might have to swim for it. How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket. I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks anyway. Hang on to me. Okay. No, I'm not married, but I'm a police officer. Application denied. I'm sorry. I cannot authorize that. Over. Counselors, what's the legal perspective? Over. I would litigate with extreme confidence. I concur. Open with Article 15 of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction. “No party, under any circumstances, shall be denied... due and proper consideration without prejudice in perpetuity.” On three again. Wait. Just in case this is a suicide... or they capture us and we never see each other again... I just want to say thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy. I think you've still got lightning in you. - Let's jump. - No! Goddamn it! Tell him. Over. Captain Sharp is offering to assume the responsibility of foster parenthood. He wants you to live with him. Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky? What do you think, pal? Coming down. Over and out. They're coming down. Over and - ♪ Alleluia ♪ ♪ Alleluia ♪ Don't let go. ♪ Alleluia ♪ The Black Beacon storm was considered... by the US Department of Inclement Weather... to be the region's most destructive meteorological event... of the second half of the 20th century. It lingered through six high tides... and inundated the islands with punishing winds... and extreme high waters. On St. Jack Wood... powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk... and demolished the village bandstand and casino. Scout master's log, October 10th. Reconstruction continues, increasingly ahead of schedule... which I attribute to a particularly robust esprit de corps among the troop.
