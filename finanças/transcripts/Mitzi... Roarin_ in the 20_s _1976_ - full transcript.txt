You know, what's exciting about being in the '20s? - Everything, the glamor, the fashions, the wild fads, movie sheiks and shivas, speakeasies, jazz. But you know what's the most fun? Being a flapper. For my iron deficiency. Of course, it is quite a challenge too because every flapper has to be as daring as Clara Bow, as world weary as Zelda Fitzgerald, and vampy enough to drive men absolutely mad with desire. Of course, it can give you a terrible headache too. I mean, a flapper's life is nothing if it isn't fast, exciting, gay, dangerous, carefree, and just a little decadent. And if you don't feel faint at least twice a day, well, honey, you're just not doing it right. For instance, tell you what happened to me just yesterday. It all started, the first thing in the morning at the crack of noon. (phone rings) Hello. - Darling, it's me. I've got a swell idea. Why don't I throw a party tonight and we'll get married? - Well, that depends on who you are. - Reggie, you silly goose. - Oh, sweet Reggie, I have such a busy day already. I don't know how I'll be able to fit in a marriage. Anyway, if I marry you, what will I tell all the others? - If you won't marry me, I'll jump off the Woolworth Building. - That's what I'll tell them. I'll see you later. Bye-bye.

It seems like a wonderful fight. And of course, I feel right at home in this matching outfit with pockets for simply everything. Notice the tickets. You see, in sports, accessories are the things (men cheer) that make you a roaring success. - [Announcer] Tunney's down! But wait, Dempsey will go to a corner. - Please, please, I can't even hear myself. It's something about a long count. Well, anyway, back to the fight. I wouldn't wanna miss anything.

Now Mr. Posh is one of New Jersey's leading citizens and benefactors having been very successful in the business of... - Importing. Chemicals. - Yeah, by the barrel or by the case. As you can see, New Jersey doesn't have to take a rumble seat to Paris or even France when it comes to expensive fashions, as is obvious by this very classy multi-pastel handkerchief dress in flower print, with genuine silk rose to accent its smartness. - Smells good too. - My scent.

I haven't seen you lately. - I've been rather busy. - Really? - Lindbergh begged me to see his plane off to Paris, the Spirit of something or other. - Flying to Paris? He's mad. France is ghastly this time of year. - And you, what have you been doing with yourself lately? - The usual, following the ponies. - Not too closely, I hope. (laughs) Tell me, how was the season in South Hampton? - Pretty much the same. - Hmm. - Googie was grouchy. Buffy was huffy. Sookie was surly. And Tweaky was absolutely freaky. - Nothing changes. - Thank God for tradition. I did go to a rather amusing party. - You did? - Yes, I did. - Really? So did I. - Did you now? - Yes. - Where? - You tell first. - I went to the Vanderbilts. - Really? - We wore nothing but white. - I went to Isadora's.

I hope you're not in any danger. - And you? - What? - Are you still drinking the way you used to? - I believe so. Grasp the glass firmly, bend the elbow, and aim carefully for the mouth. - And don't grieve too closely to an open flame. - Actually, I don't drink the way I used to. I never drink bathtub gin without straining it first. - Swallow your rubber ducky, eh. - How droll. My soap on a rope.
