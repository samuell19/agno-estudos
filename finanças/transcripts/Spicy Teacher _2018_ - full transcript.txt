(Ferocious Dog Inside) (Gateway to Hell) Xu Lei! Mr. Xu! Xu Lei! I told you not to try to find me. You hear me? Come back with me, Xu Lei. Can you find someone else? I don't want to be a teacher anymore. Is it better to be a hobo? At least I don't have to face it. I don't know what you've been through. But you should come back to the school, back to your normal life. But I don't want my normal life. Phooey! Damn you! How can you do this to me? It's not easy for me to find you. I don't have a new coach, and the baseball team is disbanding. I don't know how to tell Ya-rong. Ya-rong? Where is Ya-rong? Ya-rong! Where are you? Ya-rong! Ya-rong! Are you here? Ya-rong! Are you here for me? You're Ya-rong? Yeah. Open your mouth. Shame on you! Ya-rong! Where are you? Shame on you! Ya-ronnggg! What the hell?! Why did you do that? I'm Ya-rong. No, you're not. You're a liar. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. You're a liar... I'm not a liar. You're a liar. You're not Ya-rong. You're a liar, liar, liar... Wait... ll need to know what's happening here. Who's a liar? - He is! -She is! You're a liar, liar, liar... Enough! Xu Lei! She is Tong Ya-rong. Tong Ya-rong? T-O-N-G, Y-A, R-O-N-G. Really? Ya-rong? It's been a long time, Ya-rong. I think you're... ...heavier? What are you talking about? I'm a natural beauty. - Really? -Yeah. You're crazy. Don't be mad. They were having a friendly game today. What are you doing here? I'm fixing their balls and gloves. About our budget, sir... Look at their bats. Hello? I'll be right there, sir. Yes, sir? How was the game, Coach? I quit. What have you done to the coach? Tell me! Let's protect the earth Don't look down on us We'll take the bus Get to the point! Oh. Top of the 1st inning, they provoked us Stone pitched and hit the batter They protested Another pitch hit the batter again The next batter turned and left Top of the 2nd inning, Gong-wei got a grounder when David got another ball and tagged the runner out But the umpire saw it and warned him Safe! Top of the 3rd inning, Ying-shao and Gong-wei got one out while they played us foul Luckily Shao-ya leaped and passed the ball to put the runner out Top of the 4th inning, they broke our defense while Eyeglasses was on the scout In the meantime, Jie didn't hesitate before he passed the ball home Here! But Coach appeared out of the blue and hit by the ball The game ended earlier because he got hurt, yeah What are you doing? You're too old for that. What's with the "yeah"? Listen... I don't think you know what baseball is. What? What? You don't like what I've said? Are you glaring at me? Who do you think you are? I know that you're all good boys. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. What matters is... ...the process! Obviously you enjoyed the process. That's great. It's wonderful, isn't it? Yeah, that's it. You're dismissed! Go home! I've got to go! Hey! Xu Lei! Don't go... Stop it. They're watching us. Come on. Stop it. With your head down there, I'm embarrassed. Let go of me! Let go! I said, let go! I said, let go! Do you hear me? I need this, please. Shame on you! Miss Tong... we can't help those troublemakers. Why don't we disband our baseball team? But... we used to be famous for our baseball team. How could you say that? But that's history. We've got an excellent basketball team and a great cheerleading team. Listen... playing baseball is their only hope. If you give up baseball, you abandon them. Please? Give me one more chance. Thank you. Give me a bowl of noodles! And an egg too! Hey! You haven't paid for this month. But I've paid you already. Get out of here. Don't scare my customers away. I suppose you need to eat every day. For your well-being and safety, we're on patrol every day. We deserve to be paid. But ll don't earn much. I can't afford it. Fine. You'll see how high the crime rate is in the night market. Go! Go away, you hear me? Stop it! Stop it! Oh no! My darling egg... Who was that? Who threw it at me? Me. It was me. I'm a man in black. You can call me an urban observer, or a... ...non-resident moving citizen. What's that? It's... ...a hobo. What's the difference? It's completely different. Learn my own living. By recycling, I've made lots of money. You want money? Come with me. Listen, you bastard! If don't get my money, I'll come back and kill you. Let's go! Come on! Run! Hey, you! Where is Stone? I don't know. I haven't seen him. But I can substitute for him. Forget it. It's not the first time that he's absent. But.. Who are you? Hello, ma'am. I'm a backup. My name is... Hey, outfielders! What are you doing? We're practicing! She's stumbling. Great! Can you pay more attention? You're a burden to us. Why don't you play the mascot with the teacher? Come on, girls. Han Ke-er is a backup, but she's been working hard. And, Xiao-le... the mascot is the emblem of our school. It's sacred and can't be violated. It seems to me that you despise it. Here's the deal. Why don't you stay after school and play the mascot with me? No, ma'am. You're good at it. You've done a great job. Let's go on. Come on. Keep practicing. Let's pick up what we left. Are they good? Yeah, great. What are you doing? Why aren't you practicing? Hey! Hey, bird! Yeah, you. Come here. Come here. You're in charge here, Annie. I'm a pigeon, Miss Tong. Whatever. Excuse me. Please don't interfere with our practice. But Miss Tong... you're here while we're here. Wrap yourselves up then. I know it hasn't been easy for you, but the baseball team is our most... ...independent club. How I wish that Lei were here! Those brats would be submissive to him. Lei? He used to be my teacher. People call him the ace teacher. He's Xu Lei. Sir? What's the name of the beggar that you brought here? Beggar? Umm... No, the hobo. You mean Xu Lei? Is he really that good? Miss Tong! You don't know him at all. Lei is a weirdo and genius. No one is more difficult than he is. But he can tame the most difficult kids. People call him the ace teacher. He's Xu Lei. Why is he a hobo if he's that good? You don't understand a thing. He has been through a lot. After his beloved Miss Tong left him... Me? It's another Miss Tong, not you. He quit his job as a teacher. But he has no other talents. That's why he has become a hobo. Nobody has managed to get him back Spring is you. You're fog. Fog is me. I'm spring. Where can I find him? You'd better stay away from him. It's scary enough when you look from afar. But it's even scarier when you get closer. It makes your spine tingling. It's scary as hell. If you're not lucky enough, you'll be dead for sure. I mean it. And he's as low-minded as one can be. He can do anything. Are you happy, sir? Come back soon, sir. Forget me not. Love you. Bye. Xu Lei? Ya-rong? Ya-rong? Ya-rong! Ya-rong! Ya-rong! Ya-rong Ya-rong Xu Lei? Xu Lei! Xu Lei! Ah! Don't, Xu Lei! Don't leave me, Ya-rong. No! I didn't do anything. Not me. Ya-rong... Why is your hand... ...so coarse? Go away! Who's here? It's you again. I told you that you're not my Ya-rong. Hey! I don't know who your Ya-rong is. But excuse me... What's the difference between your Ya-rong and me? You look different, and you sound different, and... you feel different. I believe we have something in common. Yeah. You're both female. The baseball team needs you. If you're back to be their coach, I promise that I'll find your Ya-rong. Really? Yeah. Bullshit! Ya-rong has gone abroad for years. She hasn't written a letter to me. I don't know where she is. How can you find her? You liar! This is the 21st century. Who still writes a letter? Why don't you call her? I used to have a cell phone, but I sold it for a bowl of noodles. That's not the point! Can you leave me alone? Come on! Listen, those kids are all talented. Think about it. When you're their coach and they win a game, we'll hit the headlines and get everyone's attention. Then we'll be on TV, And your Ya-rong will know where you are. Really? I... ...will... ...be... ...a... ...teacher! Wu De High School, your emblem is baseball. What a nice fan! It's a high-class one. Hey, Lei? I've cleaned it up. You'll sleep here. Thank you. Yeah, King Kong... Tell me. What do you do in the school? I do everything. It's the nicest place. You can eat, drink and sleep here. Lei! Lei! Where's my favorite teacher? Lei! Lei! How are you? Where's Lei? Huh? You're... Han Jia... ...niao! No, I'm Han Jia-bao. Yeah, you're Han Jia-bao You work in the school too? What do you do? I'm... Han Jia-niao... No, Jia-bao is in charge of our grocery store. He earns a living with the kids' money. With the kids' money? That's great! You've done it, Jia-bao. But why didn't I get the idea? What ll am now, Lei, I owe it to you. These are... ...for you. Thank you. Hey, you! Come with me! Sit still. Why are you staring at me? I can't believe it, King Kong. It's been years and you know how to cut hair? Yeah, I cut the lawns in the school. It's the same. You're bending as low as that? Look at yourself, Lei. You're bending lower than I am. But I've been doing mobile payment. - Really? -Yeah. What's that, Lei? I'm mobile in the streets and people pay me some money. Isn't that a beggar? It's a hobo. Lei! Look, Lei. I've got you some new clothes. Really? Let me see. Where is this from? Just ignore it. These are for you. Thanks. Sit down and scrub my back. Why? Why what? I used to be your teacher. Show some respect. Here. Ouch! What? Don't touch that! Oh, okay. Why did you quit being a teacher? (Baseball Club) Who did this to the locker? Stone did it. Stone? He's our best pitcher. It's said that his pitch can reach 158km/h. His dad was a famous pitcher, but he was caught for game fixing. It hit Stone like a thunderbolt. I see. Jia-bao? Yes, Lei? I need some money. Eat it. Sir? Three bowls of noodles to go. Oh. Let me introduce myself. I'm Xu Lei, the new coach of your baseball team. The Championships are about to begin. Why don't you come to practice tomorrow? I'll see. - You'll see? - Hey, Stone! I want that huge stuffed animal, but I can't get it. I'm busy here. Buy it if you want it. You've paid enough money for several of it. I'll help you. You're... I'll introduce myself again. I'm Xu Lei, the new coach of your baseball team. Hi, Coach. Hi. You make a lovely couple. Aren't you his... No, I'm not. I'm Han Ke-er from the cheerleading team. Hi, Ke-er. Oops! I'm sorry. I haven't got you a gift. You want the stuffed animal? I'll help you. But sir... Let's make a deal. If I get you that teddy bear, you'll pay for my noodles. What do you think? It's a good deal, right? Come on. It's a deal. Yeah! Warm-up. It's a warm-up. It officially begins now. Tell me. Are you Stone's good friend? I'm his best friend. Really? What do you know about his dad and him? He doesn't talk about his dad. Really? He doesn't talk about his dad. Why? Your noodles are ready. Already? Listen to me... I've spent up all my money. Here's the deal. Come to practice tomorrow. I'll give you the money, okay? Don't forget. Three bowls of noodles, okay? Bye. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I forgot something. I'll help you. I can do it by myself. Go home. It's a school night. What are you eating? I'm eating breakfast. Do you want some? No. What are you waiting for? For them to come to practice. You think they'll come if you're here? We can practice too, sir. You're... Yeah, I know. You're Dumb, and you're Dumber. We've met. I know. My name is... I've got a question. Why are you two sitting here all the time? Do you... ...love baseball? King Kong? I'll teach you something. Listen! If you don't work hard, you'll be warming the bench like them for the rest of your life. It's miserable, isn't it? But Lei, I'm... Shut up! Hey, you two! I'll teach you something too. If you don't work hard, you'll end up like that bald guy. It's miserable, isn't it? Yeah. There's an old saying for the three of you. It goes... "Idle young.," "needy old." Need what? Needy old. Need old? Wow! Bravo! You're really good. Here's the deal. Do you want a friendly game? What are you doing here? It's a public area in the school. Can't I come here? What are you doing? Why don't you teach me? Is it like that? Give it back! You're mean! Forget it. What's the big deal? It's hot! I want some sweet potatoes too. Can you leave us alone? What do you want? I'm bored. If you don't practice, I have nothing more to do than share your joy. What are you looking at? Xiao-man? Attention please, kids. Attention please... Listen to me. If you promise to play the game, I'll ask them to come cheering for you. Bullshit! Han Ke-er will be here too. Han Ke-er will be here too. What the hell do you want? I've told you. I want you to play the game. I'll get out of here if you win. You promise? But... what if you lose? Here's the deal. If you lose, you'll come to the training from now on. How's that? Yeah. Do you really need all of these? I'm paying for them, am I not? Yeah. That's it then. But you're paying them with my money. I borrowed the money, so it's mine. I'm paying for these with my money. What's wrong with it? I wouldn't do it with someone else's money. Xiao-man, these are for you. Thanks a lot. You shouldn't have. Here's the deal, Xiao-man. I have something to talk to you. Just say it. I'd be glad to help. Yeah. We have a baseball game tomorrow. Bring your cheerleading team to cheer for them. How's that? They will never go. Everyone hates the baseball team. Don't be ridiculous! Tell me. Do I get a complaint if I beat up a student? Yeah, I think so. What if I beat up a teacher? No, I guess not. Whom are you beating up? Good. I've been wanting to... ...beat you up because you never respect me as your teacher. Hey, Lei! I'll try my best to convince them to cheer for you. Okay? Where are the cheerleaders, Xu Lei? Where are they, Xiao-man? They refused to come. What did you say? They're here. Where? Go, go! Wu De High. Go! Oh no! I want the cheerleaders. What's the clown doing here? Hey, you brat! Xiao-man! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Are we playing or not, Xu Lei? My players have been waiting for long. Yeah, of course. Of course we're playing. Are you ready? Yeah. Strike one! But I'm not ready. Shut up and play. Let's go on. Strike one! Strike out! Next! Come on! Hey! Wait! You're out! Next! Safe! You're out! Change sides! Here I come! Safe! Shao-ya! What are you doing? Pass the ball! Give it to me! Hey, Fatso! Catch it! Safe! He's amazing! Outfielders! I've got it! You're out! Go, go, Wu De High! Go, go, Wu De High! Go, go, Wu De High! Your emblem is baseball! Go, go, Wu De High! Strike! Stone, Stone... Objection! About what? About... His pitch was too fast. What do you mean? Listen... It's a friendly game. They're not playing for real. And they're just kids. I'm sorry. Stone, would you please... slow the pitch down... ...by 20? Thanks. Let's go on. Strike! You're out! Change sides! I quit. Why? We're much older than they are. You're disqualified if you quit. The game can't go on with only eight of them. We're not losing. We're just quitting. You lose when you quit. According to the rules, a game can't go on with less than nine players. See? It's 2:0 now. So you've lost the game. Whatever. Don't forget, kids, to come to practice tomorrow. Thank you. Hey, Fatso! Can you run faster? And you, the outfielders! Please respond sooner and run faster, okay? You're being careless here. They haven't been back for long. I don't think we can push them too hard. Hey, you! Come here! Come on! The outfielders! Faster! How will you get in the Championships if you're careless like this? We want to practice too, but there are pebbles everywhere in this field. It's dangerous for us. Oops! See? So many pebbles. We'll get hurt easily. Haven't you heard? "You cannot make bricks without straw." He's right. "You can't make something out of nothing." We can't practice under the circumstance. So if there are no pebbles in the field, you'll be willing to practice? Yep. Lei? Why are we doing this? Yeah, Lei, I'll be busy tomorrow. Why don't you ask them to do it? And where's King Kong? Stop complaining. Have I ever asked you to do something for free? Of course not. To tell you the truth, I asked King Kong to prepare dinner for you. It's my treat. I'll buy dinner with my money. Your money? Oh no! Lei must be sick. Oh no! Cut the crap and do your work! Then we'll eat dinner together. But Lei... the field is huge. We'll never finish the work. He's right. Why don't you ask the players to do it? Time is money for all those players. They should never waste it, okay? And most importantly, they're my students, just like you used to be. You're a great teacher, Lei. Jia-bao? Do you have NTD200? I need the money. Huh? He hasn't changed at all. It's time to go, Xu Lei. Let's do it tomorrow. No. I promised them that I'll give them a clean field. We'll eat some midnight snacks. Then I'll help you do it. Miss Tong... ll can't believe that you'd say something like that. We have to keep all our promises. As a teacher, whether the students identify with us or not, we should never give up on them. And most importantly... It's my treat. Why didn't you say so, Miss Tong? I would never ask you to pay for it, but most importantly, I've wanted to talk to you about how to teach these kids, okay? Let's get some midnight snacks. What, all of them together? You can't get it. Why do you have to be so stubborn? I'm not stubborn. I'm persistent. You know, all the masterpieces in the world were made with persistence. I'll try it every day, for a hundred or a thousand times. I believe I'll get it eventually. If you say so. I've owed you the money for six bowls of noodles. Six bowls. Come to practice tomorrow. I'll pay you back. Your delivery, Lei! Sent by the director? Yeah. Take a look, kids. You've got everything that you need. I've worked hard to get the school to buy us... ...new equipment! From now on, you'll have to work harder. How wonderful! Beautiful! Let's open it. Push it. Let's count to three. One, two, three! Be careful! Yeah! I've got new equipment! I've got it. I've got it... Come out of there, Kong! Come out! Come out! Come out! I'll smash your brain! Why are you lying, Eyeglasses? The scenery is better like this. See? Up and down. I can see all. Oh my God! Is she a cheerleader too? She's my type. Why don't we ask them now? Annie, after school, are you coming to my party? Shao-ya's house is very, very, very big. They have a karaoke room, a swimming pool and a great stereo set. And a Jacuzzi that can hold all the cheerleading team at the same time. You're a lousy baseball team, and you're here to harass them? You good-for-nothings! Hey! You own the schoolyard? What we're doing here is none of your business. What? What? What? What's the big deal with being tall? Are your parents giraffes? Show us some respect. I think you owe us an apology. Actually... giraffes are cuddly. I was telling the truth. You couldn't even beat those graders. You don't deserve the schoolyard. What a waste of resources! I'll say it again. You owe us an apology, or... Or what? Are you trying to outnumber us? Even if you outnumber us... ...you're still good-for-nothings. You good-for-nothings Here come the good-for-nothings. We're outnumbering you. What now? You good-for-nothing! You're dead! Jie! Calm down! Calm down! He's trying to fool me with a cheap ball? Listen, I'll be damned if don't beat him up. Calm down! Calm down! Let go of him, Lei! Lei! Calm down! Listen to me! The baseball team is in trouble, Lei. It's a misunderstanding, sir. - A misunderstanding? -What? What happened? I asked you to be the coach, Mr. Xu, but I think those kids are getting worse. I'm sorry, sir, but I trust my students. They will never... Shut up! Look at the baseball team. They're like savages. And those savage kids may run a red light or even rob a bank someday. It breaks my heart. But it's not our problem. They provoked us. We have the best basketball team. They don't need to provoke you. But they've hated us for long. Why do you keep blaming us, sir? Yeah! Is it a riot? Shut up! What? Don't you know you've done something wrong? One demerit for each baseball player. If you do it again, I'll disband the team. Go back to practice! I don't care who provoked whom. It's wrong to get involved in a fight. You aren't even speaking for us. Aren't you our coach? It's not your fault, Xu Lei. Those kids are hard to tame. I'm fine. Who am 1? I'm Xu Lei. I wouldn't give up so easily. What are you doing here? No, son. I can explain. I'm your dad after all. Here. I'll help you. Hey, son... You have to calm down, okay? Don't break any plates. People are watching. Okay? Where were you when Mom died? I don't have a dad. You know well what you did. For the past few years... Please get out of here. It's the stall that my mom left me. You're not welcome here. You're still here? (Shi Zhen) Come on! Some coins for the baseball team! Some coins for the baseball team! Thank you... Yesterday I've got enough money by myself for a new glove. Today there are three of us. I think we'll manage to get all the new equipment before the Championships. Come on! Some coins for the baseball team! Ladies and gentlemen... Hey, Lei... ll know we don't have enough money, but it's embarrassing to raise money like this. Fine. Give me your savings then. I'll buy new equipment. Some coins for the baseball team! Some coins for the baseball team! Come on. Donate us some coins. Listen, Fatso... I've got your catcher's mask. Don't forget to come to practice. Okay, Mr. Fatso? You... What? Some coins for the baseball team, okay? Donate us some coins. Donate us some coins. Some coins for the baseball team, Miss. Please? Tada! I've got us eight more balls. How's that? Surprised? Happy? Hail me! I win. Hey, Fatso? See? Here are your helmet and glove. Baseball is better than mahjong. Look at our equipment. Stone? Look at it, Stone. I've got this bat especially for you. And it's brand new. Don't be so difficult. Let's play baseball. Let's... ll told you that I don't want to play. If you really don't want to play, why do you... ...keep this with you? Mind your own business! Leave me alone! What are you doing? Where do you think the new equipment is from? We've never performed well enough for the school to give us money. But Xu Lei raised money every night in the streets to buy all those things for you. Do you see any pebbles in the baseball field? You think those pebbles just disappeared? Xu Lei picked them all up one by one every night. So what? We didn't ask him to do that. Excuse me. You're so clumsy, just like those baseball players. I suggest... ...you cheer for them by yourself. Hi. Are you Yang Hao? Yes, ll am. We're from the neighboring high school. We love to watch you playing basketball. Can you take a photo with me? Of course. Come on. Three, two, one! Yeah! Let's take one together. Me too! Come closer! One, two, three! Yeah! We hope you'll get in the Championships. That's for sure because we're good. And we hope... ...you'll come cheering for us. Yes, we will. Go! Thanks. Bye! Hey! Wu De basketball team? Yeah. Are you here to root for us too? What root? Tree roots? What's the big deal to get in the Championships? And you picked up the girls from our school? You'd better restrain yourselves. Are you kidding me? We get in the Championships... ...because we're good. Those girls came to me... ...because I'm attractive enough, which has nothing to do with you. Please don't hit me in the face! Who? Who's that? It's me. I think you need my permission before you touch anyone from our school. Who the hell are you? The captain of Wu De baseball team, Stone. Aren't you the lousy team that couldn't even beat the graders? Say that again if you dare. Lousy team! Lousy team! Lousy team! Lousy team... Get them! Hey, Annie? I heard our baseball and basketball teams fought with some kids from the neighboring school. Why do they keep that lousy team? The Championships are about to begin. What are you doing? How dare you?! You hurt the basketball team from the neighboring school. Who's responsible for that? Who? I am! What are you doing, Stone? I don't think it's your responsibility. You don't have to take all the blame. I think disbanding the baseball team is better than disbanding the basketball team. Good. That's true. Stone led others to get involved in a fight. Two demerits. As for other members, one demerit each. Wu De baseball team damaged our reputation. I'll hereby disband the team. Sir? Those kids started it. Without their help, it would be worse for me. If you're disbanding the baseball team, for the sake of fairness, please disband the basketball team too. Don't put me in such a dilemma. It's not up to me to decide. Unless... Unless... Unless what? Unless... You don't want to know. Stop! I hate it when someone leaves me in suspense. All right. Unless the baseball team wins the Championships and get... ...the gold medal! Otherwise we'll disband it! I don't think they can make it. Miss Tong... the ball is as round as you are. Anything is possible. We haven't even played any games. How do you know who is winning or losing? Miss Tong... if you don't have faith in them, they'll never have faith in themselves. So I'll have to try after all. Stone! I know you love baseball. Come back to practice. I told you that I don't like baseball. Aren't you going to prove it? Humph! You said you don't like baseball, but why do you always watch others playing it? If you have nothing else to say, you can go now. Hey! Why don't you think about your future? You're all so talented. Don't give up on yourselves. Come back to practice. Isn't it too late now? Can we win the gold medal? We'll be disbanded anyway. Why do we waste our time? Persistence. If you're not persistent enough, how do you know that you won't get it? Why are you so stubborn? You're the one who's stubborn. I'm not stubborn. I'm persistent. What's my name? Xu Lei. Exactly! I'm Xu Lei. I lay the stone. I'm more persistent than anyone else. I'll prove it to you now. Strike! Yeah! You're mine! You're mine! You see that? Yeah, I see that. It was Stone who did that. No one likes you in the cheerleading team. And you can't dance well. Why are you staying in the team? Because I want to cheer for you, just like Xu Lei does. He always has faith in the baseball team. He never gives you up. Do you really want to quit? If you're quitting because of your dad, I don't think he wants to see you like this. My dad used to be my hero. Two years ago, before I was transferred here, he was a pitcher. I used to be Stone's hero. But... two years ago, when I played for a professional team, ll made a huge mistake. It all began with that final game. Bottom of the 9th inning, it was 9:8. We were one point ahead. But nobody knew that I didn't want to win the game. Shi Zhen! Go! His team made it into the final game. One more strike, and they would win the championship. Stone's mom got terminal cancer. I couldn't afford her medical expenses. If I lost the game, money wouldn't be a problem anymore. So that game... When the game is over, you'll recover soon. When I looked at him on the pitcher's mound, naive as I was, I thought I would be proud of my dad for the rest of my life. Actually with my last pitch, I didn't throw the game. Looking at Stone in the stands, I decided to face myself honestly. I didn't fix the game. I never thought that the batter would hit the ball. I didn't betray my own belief, but without the money, I would lose my beloved wife. When my teammate caught the ball, ll knelt down and burst into tears. They thought I was crying for joy, but only I knew in my heart that I won the game... but lost my beloved wife. He knelt down on the pitcher's mound. I was dying to run into the field to hug him and tell everyone that he was my dad and I was proud of him. Shi Zhen! He's my dad! The game fixing scandal was revealed. We won the championship while the gambling dealer was on the run. The police found a list of players, and I was on it. When I was told that he fixed the game, I was petrified. Was the man on TV really my dad? Was it him who taught me honor and faith? I was put in jail, and because I couldn't afford the medical expenses, my wife passed away. When I got out of jail, no team would hire me, and no school wanted me to be their coach. I went to Stone, but he wouldn't forgive me. So... ll came here by myself. Maybe your dad didn't throw the game. What about the news reports? What about the list? It's history now. I don't want to talk about it. Since you quit baseball, the plant has grown on the pitcher's mound. Whenever I looked in this direction, they were either playing poker or making a barbecue. I've been wondering when I'll see you standing here again. Don't worry. Even if nobody supports you in the school, I, Han Ke-er, will always cheer for you. Even if you're the only one left in the team, I'll play baseball with you. Come on. Let's play baseball. Play baseball? I can play cheerleading on my own. Why can't I play baseball with you? Go on to your position. The batter's up. Bang! Han Ke-er, the heavy batter in Wu De, hit a very long, high fly ball. She's running to the first base. Running as fast as she can! Lei! Lei! Lei! Lei! Listen to me... Lei! Who the hell are you? I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'm Xiao-man! Xiao-man? There's something wrong with the baseball team! Why didn't you say so? I'll kill you! What? What happened? What's wrong? Why are you all standing here? What happened? What? What? Haven't seen someone practicing? Don't forget our bet. What... What bet? If we win, you'll get out of here. Yeah, I remember. Do you want to bet, boys? Do you want to bet? Hey, brats! In order to get rid of me, come here and practice! Come on! Show me your speed! Wu De High... Go, go! Your emblem... ...is baseball! Wu De High... Go, go! Wu De High... Go, go! Listen, Jie... You don't have to fix your eyes on the ball to catch it, but you have to do that when you pass the ball. Okay? Why can't you do that? Sir... haven't you noticed that I've never seen you in the face? Damn! I've known it in my heart for long. I know that I can't force you to like me. And I know that you'll never like me. But I'm talking about passing balls. You have to look at your target. Sir... I'm blind. Damn! I know you're... The Baseball Rulebook... ...in Braille? Please donate coins to support our baseball team. Thank you. Wu De High... Go, go! Your emblem... ...is baseball! Wu De High... Go, go! Wu De High... Go, go! Keep going! Come on! I can't run anymore! Do you love baseball? Yeah! Do you want to get to the first base? Yeah! Then stand up! Come on! Run! The rival team of Lan Yang High is Wu De High who hasn't performed well for three years in a row. I think the results are quite obvious. Huh? I can't believe what Wu De has done. It's a double play. It's a strike. Strike out! How Wu De has been doing today makes our jaws dropped. They've got the best defense and they've been doing well in batting. Is it the lousy team that I know of? Safe! Another point for Wu De. Top of the 8th inning. It's 8:5. Wu De is three points ahead. Here comes the pitch! It's a flyball toward the center field. The center-fielder dashes for it. It's an out! Game over! It's the top of the 3rd inning. It's the fourth batter up from Wu De. Oh no! He stumbles and falls. He can't get to the first base. What's going on? The second runner from Wu De almost caught up with the first one. Luckily he turned around in time. It's a semifinal and bottom of the 5th inning. Beyond all expectations, Wu De has got an excellent performance. Oh no! The cheerleader stumbles! But she got up immediately. Only one cheerleader for all their games. Her persistence moves me. Here comes the pitch! He puts the ball in play! It's a grounder toward the shortstop. The shortstop gets it and passes it home. - The runner is touched out at home... - Captain? We're up. We'll fight for the gold medal if we win this game. And from their first game till now, they've got the same pitcher all along for each game... Let's celebrate! Yeah! What are you doing? That's enough! What are you happy for? You're fighting for the gold medal. Do you know your rival team? They've won the gold medal for 11 years in a row. It was them who took our place. You'll have to keep fighting. If you don't win the game, the team will be disbanded. Ya-rong... you can't force them. What matters in the training is being flexible. And I have faith in them. Xu Lei, you... What? What? I hate it when someone gets too close to me. Give it to me! I'm our spiritual flower. No, it's my plump girl. Cheers! Hello. Have some pizza? No? I'm sorry. Why are you saying sorry? You did a good job. For... ...the bat. Oh, forget it. It's nothing that I can't fix. What matters is that... ...you're willing to keep playing baseball. Oh yeah... Here. But I threw it away. I think your dad would be glad to see you back in the field. But ll didn't come back for him. Haven't you thought about it? Maybe he didn't throw the game. Why do you all think so? Is it because they won the game? No, it's not. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. What matters is... ...your faith. Let bygones be bygones. All I want is play baseball. Yeah. Come inside and celebrate with us. You're the captain. We need you. By the way, I'll... ...put it here. Move! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! If you love baseball and can't eat without it or can't sleep without it, you're welcome to the final game of the Championships. Wu De High has made a comeback. And they're aiming at the gold medal. Have you seen Xu Lei, Eyeglasses? No. Xiao-man? Have you seen Xu Lei? No, I haven't seen him. Yeah, where's Xu Lei? Don't worry. Mr. Xu will be here soon. Okay? Let's take it easy. Okay? Come here and cheer for ourselves. Come on! Wu... Go, go, Xiong Quei! Go, go, Xiong Quei! Well... Is it a football game or a basketball game? What are you afraid of? - They're just louder than we are. -Yes! - Are we losing? -No! We can't lose, Xiao-man, or we'll be ugly like... Like what? Like you. Let's go! Come on, Xiao-man! Yeah! Come on! Come on! Go, go, Wu De High! Your emblem is baseball! Go, go, Wu De High! The game begins. It begins now. It's the first batter up from Wu De High, Han Shao-ya. Here comes the pitch. Wow! It's a 150km/h fastball. He puts the ball in play. It's a grounder to the left. Third baseman passes it to the first base and puts the first batter out. The ball bounces toward the shortstop. The shortstop passes it to the first base and puts him out. The third batter from Wu De sneaks a bunt and runs swiftly to the first base. It's an infield hit! It's the fourth batter up from Wu De. I think everyone knows him now. Will his dream come true? Will he get to the first base? It's a strike! The batter skipped it, It's a high flyball toward the center field. The runner goes past the second base, but the batter stumbles and falls before the first base. The outfielder picks up the ball and passes it to the first base to put the batter out. All the players from Xiong Kuei are experienced in defense. For the gold medal, Wu De's starting pitcher is of course Stone. But he has been the pitcher for all their games. He is exhausted now. Oh no! It's a ball. When he's exhausted, a pitcher gradually loses control of his pitches. Stone has been pitching for every game. His arm must be sore now. The batter puts the ball in play. It falls in the outfield. It's a Texas Leaguer. Safe! Xiong Kuei has a runner on the first base. And he's really fast. He takes off now. The pitcher passes the ball to the second base. He's out! His mission failed. There are no more runners now. He's getting hyped-up. The batter's got three strikes. He's officially striked out. Two outs and no runners. The ball is going through the shortstop. It's a hit. Two outs and Xiong Kuei has a runner on the first base. It's Xiong Kuei's fourth batter up. He had three hits in the previous game. He's got excellent performance, quite a heavy batter. The ball is through the third base and shortstop toward the left field. The runner gets to the second base. Two outs and runners on the first and second bases. It's a crisis. The ball goes through the third base and shortstop. It's another hit. The outfielder catches the ball and passes it. The third-baseman hesitates. Xiong Kuei's coacher tries to affect them. It's a foul throw when the third-baseman tries to pass the ball home. Xiong Kuei gets another point. They're two points ahead now. Bottom of the 5th inning. It's 5:1. Xiong Kuei is four points ahead. Is your motorbike okay, Mr. Xu? Can we make it? Of course. But ll didn't hear it. What's the score? Mr. Xu! It's the fifth inning and 5:1. It'll be too late if you don't hurry. Sit tight! Okay. I'm stepping on it. Go, go, Wu De High! Wu De High... Wu De's cheerleader is exhausted and their mascot too. The cheerleader has been involved with each one of their games, just like their pitcher. Coach! Xu Lei! Sorry for being late. You're finally here. What took you so long, Lei? I need an explanation. I'll explain later. What's the situation? Bottom of the 8th inning. Four points behind. Bottom of 8th. Xiong Kuei plays offense. Two outs and base full. Three more points for Xiong Kuei and seven points ahead in this inning, the game will be over earlier. The ball is flying toward the right field. It's flying high and deep. The outfielders are trying to catch it. The left and right fielders seem to get hurt when they land. The crowd holds their breath, waiting for the decision. Only the moans of the outfielders are heard. Out! Yeah, I see it! Wu De's outfielder gets the ball. The batter's out. Xiong Kuei hasn't got any more points. But their coach walks out of the dugout. He seems unsatisfied with the decision. Out! But the umpire refuses to budge. He's out! They change sides. What took you so long? They've seen us through. How can we go on? We're fine. It's all right even if they've seen us through. The game isn't over yet. We still have a chance. Ya-rong? Are they all right? Do they look like they're all right? Gong-wei and Ying-shao will both take a rest. Huh? Shut up! Stone? How's your arm? I'm fine. Don't lie to me. I'm afraid that your arm will be ruined forever. You taught me to be persistent. If I give up now, I'll never forgive myself. What do we do now? How do we go on without the two of them? Oh no! I have no other choice now. So... I'll have to use... ...my secret weapon. It's top of the 9th inning. Wu De is four points behind. It's their last chance of offense. A pinch hitter for Wu De. But who are you? Let's see. Yeah, I've got it. He's one of their backups. He hasn't played in any games. Does it mean that Wu De has given up? The first pitch is a strike. The batter does nothing. The second one is also a strike. The batter still doesn't do anything. He puts the ball in play. Hey, run! Run now! The pinch hitter has got them a double. Wu De hasn't given up yet. Now we know how good the pinch hitter is. Go, Wu De! Go, Wu De... Another pinch hitter for Wu De. Who's that? Wait. Let's see. Yeah, I've got it. He's one of their backups too. The ball is flying towards the right field. It lands. It's a beautiful hit. The runner comes straight home from the second base and gets a point. But this pinch hitter... Who's that? A run down between the first and second bases. He gives up and is touched out. But these two bench players have got one point for Wu De. What's wrong? What's wrong? How do I know? It's 3:6 for Wu De. They're three points behind. The batter up is the pitcher, Stone. The first pitch is a strike. Stone does nothing. Go, Stone! He puts the ball in play. It flies high and it's a hit. It's their ninth batter up. He's visually impaired. But he has excellent hearing. He can hear the pitch and swing his bat. It's a strike. Xiong Kuei knows that he can only swing according to what he hears. So they pitch slow balls to prevent him from hearing them. Now! He hits it and it flies fast. It goes toward the outfield. But why isn't the batter running to the first base? Oh no! He bumps against the wall. Two outs. A runner on the second base. It's a double, very high and deep. The runner comes home from the second base. It's another hit. Is Wu De turning the tables? He sneaks a bunt out of the blue. There's an error in Xiong Kuei's defense. The runner comes home. It's 5:6. Wu De is only one point behind. It's Wu De's fourth batter up who's dying for stepping onto the first base. Is his dream going to come true? Go! Fatso. Now both runners are trying to steal bases. They've made it! Wu De has caught up, and it's 6:6 now. What a shame! He's hit by pitch! But doesn't it mean that the batter can finally step onto the first base? I'm on the first base! The crowd is cheering for him. Zhou Yong-qing, the batter who has never stepped onto the first base, can finally fulfill his dream. I'm on the first base! I'm on the first base! The ball breaks through the infield defense. The runner comes home from the second base. But the fat boy on the first base hesitates to run to the second base, and is forced out before he gets there. Three outs and they've missed the chance. It's bottom of the 9th inning. Wu De has caught up with their rival team. As long as they hold it out, the game will go into an extra inning. It's a flyball behind the home plate. The catcher gets it. One more out, and they're into an extra inning. Hold on! Stone. It's the last one. Go, Wu De! The batter from Xiong Kuei puts the ball in play. It goes through the shortstop. It's a hit. The batter runs swiftly to the second base. Xiong Kuei is about to get their winning point. It's the heavy batter from Xiong Kuei. It's a very unreasonable ball. The pitch lands too early. Luckily the catcher gets it in time. Wu De's pitcher has completed every game. Maybe his arm has been hurt? The catcher asks for a timeout to talk to the pitcher. You can't pitch anymore, Stone. Give me the ball, Fatso. But your arm is... Give it to me! Make the pitch, Stone! We're here! Yeah! We're here! We're here, Stone! Come on! Come on, Stone! We're here! We'll support you! Come on! The love and support from his teammates moves me and the crowd. Everyone stands up and roots for Stone. They're all hyped-up. Stone's persistence touches them. Shi Zhen... Shi Zhen! He's my dad! Here comes the pitch. The batter hits it. Oh no! It's a deep flyball. The left and right fielders are running towards it. Come on! The right fielder gets down. Are we going to witness the miracle again? The left fielder takes a leap. But he falls to the ground. The center fielder picks up the ball and passes it. The shortstop passes it to the third base. The catcher gets the ball. The runner bumps into him. They both stumble and fall. Safe! The ball falls out of the catcher's glove. Oh no! It's 7:6. Xiong Kuei wins. They've got the gold medal again. How I wish that they could beat Xiong Kuei! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. It's not your fault. You've done your best. Stone? Stone! Although Wu De lost the game, their persistence has won the applause from their rival team and the respect from the crowd. Wu De! Good job! Take off the caps! Bow down! Hi, Mr. Chairman. Why didn't you tell me in advance for me to get ready to greet you? I'm here to deal with the baseball team. They've done a great job. They missed the gold medal, but they were second. Stone? Xu Lei is leaving. Aren't you saying goodbye? It was my fault that we lost the game and they're going to disband us. I let Xu Lei and Miss Tong down. I can't face them. Hey, Stone! You're really a stone! You're stubborn and rigid. It doesn't matter if you won or lost. At least you tried your best. Don't you remember what Xu Lei taught you? You were persistent enough to gain faith in yourselves. Because of Xu Lei, you played a game that made you proud. What you got in the process is far more important than the results, isn't it? At least say goodbye to him. Xu Lei? Do you really have to go? Yeah. I've completed my mission. Now I'm going to find my Ya-rong. I'm sorry. I haven't found your Ya-rong. But... But... Can't I be your Ya-rong? Persistence. Isn't it what we taught the kids? I think it's very likely that my Ya-rong has forgotten me, but I want to find her anyway. I think I need... ...an exact answer. But... I'm really glad to get to know you. Take care... ...Ya-rong. Wait! You came here for Ya-rong. And now you're leaving for Ya-rong. Then why did you stay in the first place? I think... I did it for my students because I'm the ace teacher, Xu Lei. Lei! Lei! Lei! I'm sorry. I've never thought that they're going to disband the team after all. We didn't win the game. Why do you have to go? You've got us involved and you're leaving us? Because of you, sir, we've fallen back in love with baseball. Please don't go. Yeah. I finally stepped onto the first base. Lei? Lei... Please stay. Don't go. I'm glad that you've finally got your faith back. And hopefully, in ten or twenty years, or someday in the future, you'll remember how happy you are when you play baseball. Don't go... Let go of me. That's enough, sir. I might catch a cold. Who permits you to leave? Not me. Hey, guys! I'm here with good news. The board of directors has decided not to disband the baseball team. Thank you, Annie. I didn't do it for you. As the captain of the cheerleading team, the daughter of the Chairman, and part of Wu De High, I think our baseball team is different from others. Besides... you're part of us too. They're not going to disband the team. Are you still leaving? But... I've done what I promised you to do. Can you let me go now? Please don't go. Listen... you have to work harder from now on. And most importantly, don't upset Miss Ya-rong again. Bye. Bye. See you. Lei... Lei? Lei? Lei! You still owe me money for six bowls of noodles!
