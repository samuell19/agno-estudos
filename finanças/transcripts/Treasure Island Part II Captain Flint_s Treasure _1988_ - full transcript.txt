Mother always said: "At night, people should sleep. And during the day..." Who is there? - This is a pleasant harbour. Not a bad spot for a layover. Not too crowded, is it, lad? - Not very crowded, sir. - Very well then, looks like a good place for me to drop my anchor. I'll stay here for a little while. Rum, bacon, and scrambled eggs, that's all I will require. - Come here, boy! If you see a sailor with only one leg, call me right away. For your trouble you'll get five, no four... three, three silver pennies, once a month. So, keep your eyes peeled. - Yes, sir. - Nice boy. Nice pl... - Ladies and gentlemen! You will now hear a sad but instructive story about a boy called Bobby. Who loved... Who loved money. Begin! Our Bobby was jolly and kind little tot. A hobby he had, he loved money a lot. It was his soft spot. All children like children, no worry or care. But Bob's on a diet, his table is bare. He's saving the fare. Money-shmoney, money-shmoney, day or night you do your best! Make more money! Make more money! And to hell with all the rest! - Then what? A penny, a shilling, and then a whole pound. Our Bob soon became a con-artist renowned. The word got around. He wasn't”: alone, our poor little tot. There's plenty of guys who love money a lot. He simply forgot. Money-shmoney, money-shmoney, day or night you do your best! Make more money! Make more money! And to hell with all the rest! - Dance, DOD-EVE! - Ladies and gentlemen! Please spare some change, if you can. [Billy Bones] A.k.a "The Captain." Owner of the chart of the Treasure Island. Drinks a lot and always has a cold. Nasty temper. Not married. - Come here, my boy. Is this for my friend, skipper Billy? - Sir, I don't know any skippers. This breakfast is for our tenant who we call "the Captain." - You could call my friend "the Captain," too. He has a scar on his face and very kindly manners, especially when hes drunk. So, this is where Billy lives? - If you mean the Captain, sir, then hes off for a walk. - Oh, Billy will be as glad to see me just as he would a good drink. Speak of the devil, there he is. Let's surprise him, shall we. - Yes, sir. - Billy! Don”: you recognize me, Billy? Don”: recognize your old mate? - Black Dog? - That's me! I wanted to check up on an old ship-mate. - All right, since you tracked me down anyway. Spit it out, why are you here? - Where's the chart, Billy? We want the chart! - What chart? I don't have any charts! - The chart! Where is it?! - I don't have any charts! No! No! I won't! [Black Dog] Old friend of Flint's. Seeks the chart of the Treasure Island. Shady temper. Not married. - More rum! - You're injured, sir. - Jim, my boy! Get me some rum and then I'm out of here! - Doctor! Doctor, quick! - Hello there, I'm Doctor Livesey! What seems to be the matter? [Doctor Livesey] A very good and cheerful person. Temper extroverted. Not married. - Doctor, help! The Captain is injured. - Injured? Nonsense! He just had a stroke from liking rum too much. All right, let's rescue this total waste of human life. Enlarged liver, very good! Enlarged spleen, excellent! Arrhythmia, just lovely! Very splendid! - Where's Black Dog? - Settle down! There are no dogs here. Remember: if you don't stop drinking, you will very soon die. The words "rum" and "death" should mean the same thing to you. Do you understand? Good bye, Jim, my boy. - Listen, Jim. I must get out of here, and quick. Otherwise they'll send me the "black spot." - What's that, sir? - It's like a verdict, lad. They're after my trunk, and if they show up here... Listen up, Jim. If they show up here, then get on a horse and get to that doctor. He can then get the entire Flints gang. On board of the Admiral Benbow! Get them all! [Blind Pew] Old friend of Flint's. Cunning and greedy. Will do anything for money. Atrocious temper. Not married. - Could you tell this poor blind man, who lost his precious eyesight... ...in the name of selflessly protecting his motherland England... ...just where exactly he happens to be? - Next to the Admiral Benbow inn, in the Black Hill Harbour. - I hear a voice. A young voice. Give me your hand, young man, and lead me into the house. And now, boy, lead me to The Captain. - Sir, I wouldn't”: dare. - Won't dare, huh? Lead, or I'll break your arm! And when The Captains sees me, yell "here's your friend, Billy!” - Here's your friend, Billy. - Oh, god. Pew! - It's okay, Billy, stay where you are. I can't see you, but I can hear the trembling of your fingers. Stretch out your right arm and get it close to mine. Now it's done. Good bye, Billy. Good boy. - Good bye! - The Black Spot. Listen, Jim! This Blind Pew is a dangerous man. But the one-legged one who sent him is even more dangerous. Do not let him get the chart. You hear? Do not! It's in my trunk. I alone know that place. Old Flint himself gave me that chart before he died. The Black Spot. At 1O o'clock. At '10 o'clock they'll some for my trunk. That's 4 more hours. That's all right! I'll show them! We still have sometime! [Billy Bones died] Fellow men of leisure, Have a sense of measure. Booze and endless drinking lead into despair. Our trip is risky, Let's not mix in whisky, Or we'll soon be sailing straight into a snare. [Billy Bones died... ] [from drinking] [too much] [rurnl] Every extra jigger is robbing you of vigour. Your internal organs get worse with every toast. - Does it bloom like roses? The liver from cirrhosis? Keep it up and you will soon give up the ghost! Fifteen men on a dead roan's chest! Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum Drink and the devil had done for the rest! Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest! Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. And a bottle of rum! Once the night is over, Here comes hangover! You will not be happy to see the light of day. And your foes are happy that you are feeling crappy. In your trembling fingers the weapons just won't stay. Once the sun is out, start with a workout! Will be light as feather any heavy load! In a healthy body spirit won”: be shoddy. Mind as sharp as arrow, and the chest is broad. Fifteen men on a dead roan's chest Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest! Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest! Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! [and so] [Billy Bones was dead] [You have nu 10 PM] - Get the door. - Yes, sir! - Billy is dead! - God rest his soul! - Search him, you idiots, then get upstairs for the trunk! - Hey, Pew! Looks like someone beat us to it! - The trunk! - The trunk has been opened! - Is the chart there? - Money! - Money, money! - To hell with money, I want Flint's papers! - Don”: see any papers! - No papers! - We got robbed by the boy! Too bad I didn't stab out his eyes! Find him, lads, he can't be very far. - We better get out of here, lads! - Run! - Run for your lives! - Run? You idiots! If you find those papers, you'll be richer than kings! - But we've got the gold, Pew! - Run, run, lads! - Dirk! Johnny! Black Dog! You won”: leave old Pew, mates! [Jimmy Hawkins] A very, very good and polite boy. Modest, kind, honest. Listens to his mom and does his exercises. Soft-tempered. - Hello, Mr. Trelawney. Good evening, Doctor. - Good evening, my friend Jim! Whats the matter? - You remember the old captain that stayed at the Admiral Benbow? Yesterday he was visited by some blind tramp. They talked, and then the Captain had a heart attack. This night some bandits, probably friends of the blind one, searched the whole inn. - What were they looking for? - They weren't looking for money. They were looking for this. - All right, let's see. A chart! A tall tree, North from the Skeleton Island... '10 feet, on the Eastern slope of the mountain. But this is the map of Captain Flint! Now we know where Flint buried his treasure. - Livesey, tomorrow I'm off to Bristol. In three weeks... no, pardon, in two weeks... No-no-no, in ten days we will have a ship. And the best crew in all of England. You, Livesey, will be the ship doctor. I'll be the admiral. And Jim Hawkins can be the ship's boy. We will find the treasure. We will swim in money and toss it into the sea. [Squire Trelawney] Dumb, greedy, lazy and condescending. A coward and a glutton. No personality as such. Not married. - Trelawney, I can go with you. However, there is one person in this affair that I find unreliable. - Who? Pray tell me the name of that scoundrel. - You, Trelawney! You do not know how to keep your mouth shut. - Livesey, from now on I'll be as quiet as a grave! - Wonderful. To Bristol, my friends! [ Bristol, 17xx A.D. 1 [ spy-glass ] [ Dear viewers! ] [Do not worry! ] [This scary pirate can't hurt Jim] [Because Jim] [ Every day 1 [does] [his morning exercises! ] You can feel free to retort, but at this point I must add that if you play any sport, that's a good lad, that's a good lad! Bike, swim, or just run around! Don”: spend all day in your bed. Get your behind off the ground, and go ahead, and go ahead! Every morning at the gym Jim! He can run and he can swim Jim! Even pirates of great height will do poorly in a fight For the pirates, they all drink For the pirates they all drink Gin! Pick any sport of your choosing Spend all your days on the court. And the pirates with all their boozing are bad at sport, are bad at sport! Success only comes with perseverance and staying on track. A thousand voices will echo this back! Every morning at the gym Jim! He can run and he can swim Jim! Even pirates of great height will do poorly in a fight For the pirates, they all drink For the pirates, they all drink Gin! [Long John Silver] A.k.a. "Barbecue," a.k.a. "One-legged." A nasty pirate, but feigns being nice. Successfully. Secretive. Not married. - My good fellow, we're off in search of treasure. We need a good ship and a good crew. - Sir, I can offer both. - Wonderful. [Hispaniola] - Just take a look at this beauty. We're damned lucky! Absolutely everyone, once they hear that were off to look for treasure... ...is doing their best to help us! - He did tell everyone, didn't he? That Trelawney. - And here is our cook, Long John Silver. I thought I found us a cook, but it appears that I found us an entire crew! They don't look very trustworthy, but that's not a big deal. I hope all is good and the schooner is ready to leave? - Pardon, sir? Ah, yes! Just one thing, sir. I will be honest with you. I don't like this expedition. I don't like these sailors. And finally... What? Yes? No! I don't like anything at all, sir! - Is that all? - I'm sorry, sir? Ah, yes! No, not all. Even though I'm the captain, I never asked about the purpose of this journey. However, every last sailor on this ship knows that we're going after treasure. I don't like that at all, sir! [Captain Srnollett] An old sailor and soldier. Brutally honest, from which suffers. Atrocious temper. Not married. - Left, right, left, right, left, right! Stop, one, two! Attention! Hear my orders! Cast off the stern and bow lines! Raise the anchor! Check the guff sail! Check the topsail rigging! Raise the sails! Full speed... Ah, yes! Full speed ahead! - Tell me, Barbecue: how long are we going to stand off and on like a burnboat? I've had enough of the captain! Hes hazed rne long enough! I want to live in his cabin and... - Hands... Your head has no price on it because it never had any brains. Do not rush things. - But Silver, I... - Quiet. I'm talking. After Squire and Doctor find the treasure and help us load it on the ship... - What are we going to do with them? - England would have left them on some deserted island. Flint or Billy Bones would have out them down like that much pork. - Dead men don't bite! - I vote... to kill. - Land ho! - This is our last chance! It's not a payment in advance, It always happens only once. When fortune throws a furtive glance That's your chance! You may come close but no cigar. And if you miss it, then you are better of wishing on a star! They are sending the black spot, sending the black spot to me! I got the black spot, I got the damned spot! Flee! And when it is within your reach, When you're almost filthy rich, Somebody throws a hidden switch! Rotten luck! It helped you pick your sailing crew, It fought and boarded ships with you! It was behind you when you drew your rnuskets. But once you make your first mistake You'll be a mouse before a snake, And snakes don't give much of a break. They are Sending the black spot, Sending the black spot to me! I got the black spot, I got the damned spot! Flee! And when it is within your reach, When you're almost filthy rich, Somebody throws a hidden switch! Rotten luck! It made you rubber, not the glue It stuffed your wallet thick for you It was behind you when you drew your rnuskets. And when it is within your reach, When you're almost filthy rich, Somebody throws a hidden switch!

Finance is better done in daylight: bank is a safer place for your doubloon. We thought we were close to treasure, we'll just tie up a few loose ends. Who's left alive will get their measure of money left to us by Flint and friends.

I hoped to end my days old and wealthy but, for a pirate, honor is a poor trait. A bullet in the back is quite unhealthy, a "black spot" makes a poor piece-o'eight.

Something you want to tell us? - There is mutiny on board. I just overheard a conversation. Apparently, Silver was one of the chief henchmen of Flint himself. He knows about the treasure, but doesn't know where it's buried. As soon as we dig it out, they'll out us all. - Captain, we got tricked by John Silver! What a splendid fellow! - He would be even more splendid hanging from a tall mast. - Yes, captain, you were right. I admit being an ass and await your orders. - I am just as much of an ass as you are, sir, if the crew managed to outwit me. Me! Captain Srnollett! Well, no good complaining about it. I have an idea, gentlemen! I suggest we don't show that we know about their plans. Let's wait and see. - Sir, they know everything! We're finished. - So, how many people on this ship can we trust? - There are seven of us, counting Jim! - Against nineteen! - I'll fight as two men! No, as four! As twelve! As... - Permission to leave, sir! Duty calls! Yes, sir! Turn around! March! - Hey, lads! Anyone of you seen this land before? - I have, sir. We got some fresh water here when I served as a cook on a freight ship. - What? Ah, yes! It seems it's best to drop the anchor on the South shore, behind that island? - Yes, yes, sir. It is called the Skeleton Island. One of the sailors on my ship knew all the landmarks. That mountain over there is called the Spy-Glass Mountain. The pirates had an outpost there. - Lads, you all worked hard! Anyone who wants is free to go on shore leave! - Hurrah for captain Srnollett! And now, everyone to the island! - Hurrah for captain Srnollett! - Listen, Hands. Stay on the ship with a few lads and keep a close eye on the captain. You'll answer for it with your own life. Got that? - I wonder what the pirates will do on the island. I've got to check it out. - Is that Jim? - We've got to catch him, lads! - He'll ruin everything! - Jim! Where are you? Look for him, lads! - Where the hell is that boy? - I'm sorry, but who are you? - My name is Ben Gunn. [Ben Gunn] Used to be a well-behaved child. Then started gambling and hanging out with pirates. Soft-tempered. Not married. - It's been three years since I talked to anyone. - Were you shipwrecked? - No, I was left here. Yes, left here as punishment. And what's your name, lad? - Jim. - And whose ship is that, Jim? Not Flint's? - No, Flint's dead. But there are a few of his old mates on the ship, which is a problem for us. - Anybody with only one leg? - Silver? - Yes, yes, yes. His name was Silver. - He's our cook and the head of the entire gang. - I can help you out. But only if... I'm I'm I'm sorry? - I just want to know... If I can get at least a thousand pounds of that money, which is mine anyway. - Of course. Squire is the most generous person in the world. - And he'll take me home? - Of course, sir! And now, tell about yourself, sir! [Ben Gum's story] Flint, rne, and a few others sailed to this island to bury the treasure. "Turn around, scoundrels!" yelled Flint. Then we decided to kill Flint and take the treasure. But 3 years later I was back on the island. Lads! I know where Flint buried the treasure! We searched for twelve days, but found nothing. Every day they cursed me more and more. And so they left me on the island. - Oh, that's a horrible story, sir. And if we make it back to the ship, you'll get a head of cheese this large. But ssshhhh. I hear steps! It's the pirates, let's hide! - Things are looking bad. Jim has disappeared, and it looks like the pirates won”: let us out of here. We have to do something. Ah-ha, here's Jim. Who's that With him? Here's Silver... and the pirates. And what's this'? Gentlemen! I have an excellent plan! - One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Keep against the tide! A cannon! They are arming a cannon! Why? Ah! They are going to shoot! Faster! One! Two! One! Two! Back water! - Srnollett and Trelawney took the weapons and fled! They took the block house! - They can't see the block house from the ship. They are shooting the flag. We must lower it. - Lower the flag? Proud sailing traditions do not allow lowering the flag during a fight! Never! - Jim! Jim, take a look! See that? That's where your friends are. - Not the pirates? - No. Silver would have raised the Jolly Roger, the pirate's flag! - Then we should go join them! - Wait, wait! I must meet with the doctor. Tell him to come alone. - Very well. - Doctor, Squire, Captain! It's me, Jim. Hello. - Doctor, I just met a man. His name is Ben Gunn and he has some kind of news for you. - What's this? - A white flag. - I'm willing to bet it's some kind of a trick. Attention! Man your posts! One! Two! One! Two! - What do you want? - I want to make a deal. Do not shoot. - Very well. Sit down, my good fellow. - Thank you. - Now tell us why you are here. - We want to get the treasure. And we'll get it. And you want to save your lives. And you have a right to that. - Do you have the map? - Maybe! - I know that you do. Give us the map. - Is that all? That wont do, my good fellow. - Then it's time to let the guns talk. - You don't say? - You've run aground, Silver! And all because of your greed. And now, here's an inspiring story for you, sir! [A song about greed] There lived a greedy pirate Billy. Not a person liked him, really. Not the sailors, not the pirates, not the children, not his kin. Couldn't help himself, our Billy, love of money drove him silly! He was always treated chilly Any place he settled in. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! The moral of this story One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed will make you sorry! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! I already said it; One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greeds a nasty habit! Girls and women Billy hated: never married, never dated. Never once, with breath abated kissed a single pretty lass. For you see, he wasn't willing to dispense a single shilling. And just when he made a killing, he had a stroke and died, alas! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! The moral of this story One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed will make you sorry! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Listen to me, will you. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Avarice will kill you! Bill is dead, and end of story. He thought money was his worry. Now he's looking sad and sorry, having lived his life in vain. Let me make this very clear: Greed can kill a buccaneer! Everybody, gather near and repeat the songs refrain. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Moral of this story One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed will make you sorry! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! I already said it; One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greeds a nasty habit! - Did you get all that, Silver? If you turn yourselves in, I'll put you in chains and you'll be tried in court. And if not, then remember that you are dealing with Captain Srnollett! And I won”: rest until you all hang. - In one hour those of you who are still alive will envy... ...the dead. - To your stations! - Dammit. It's been over an hour. It's getting a little dull. Ah! There they are! Attention, get ready! Fire! - Hand-to-hand combat! [We have fresh rum! ] - Stick 'em up! - Not bad, not bad! They got their rations for today. Well, gentlemen, it used to be four against nineteen. Now it's four against nine, excellent! Gentlemen, I congratulate you on our victory! [Musical Interlude] While the pirates are caring for their wounds... and Jim, Trelawney, Livesey, and Srnollett rest after a glorious victory... the band "Grotesque" will perform their new song... "We're all a part of this regatta" We're all a part of this Regatta We row toward the finish line In hopes to be persona grata With gold and ladies, and good wine. Some may earn more, it's not surprising, but it's a thought that eats our mind. And every day demand keeps rising while the production falls behind. So air your oars, my friends, to hell with all these riches. Our lives are short, why eat until you choke! There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! You try your best to stuff your pockets But time will come, when Mr. Grim will yank your oars out of their sockets and kindly ask you to proceed with him. Let's keep it simple, this path before us let no one curse our names, my friend! Let's try it out, let's air our oars! Let's air your oars! Stop!. The end! So air your oars, my friends, to hell with all these riches. Our lives are short, why eat until you choke? There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! - So that was you, Ben Gunn, who dug out the treasure? Splendid! And you took it all to this cave? Brilliant! Now the pirates are in our hands. I can how turn the map and the block house over to them. Marvelous! [ Back soon. Livesey. ] - What the devil's going on? What's Dr. Livesey up to? He must have some sort of plan. Well, if he has a plan, then I better come up with something, too. I'll steal Hispaniola from the pirates! - You are a scoundrel, Israel Hands! - Who, me? - Yes, you! - By thunder, that's Jim! - Who's there? It's Jim Hawkins! I'll be damned! Come in, come in! Always glad to see... an old friend. Since you're here, why don't you join us? - But sir, how did you get here? Where's Dr. Livesey, Trelawney and the captain? - We had a deal; we get the block house, and they get to leave. Where they are now, I do not know. - Sir, since I'm your prisoner, I'm at your mercy. But you should know this: it was me who took the chart from Billy Bones. It was me who eavesdropped on you and told the captain about your plans. It was me who killed Israel Hands and stole the schooner. You have lost! - Make him bleed! - Get back. What makes you think you can order around here, John? You think you're the captain? - Johnny's right! Make him bleed! - Any one of us can command here. - Gentlemen... Anyone who wants to deal with rne can step outside. Take a cutlass, him that dares. And I'll see the colour of his inside, crutch and all... ...before that pipe's empty. Not too brave now? Then hear this. Anyone who touches Jim will have to deal with me. You lot want to say something? Then say it. I'm listening. - Your pardon, sir, you're pretty free with some of the rules lately. The crew has a right to gather and council! - According to the rules! - Forecastle council! - That's the rules! - You're within half a plank of death, Jim. They're going to throw me off. Tit for tat. I'll save your life, and you'll save Long John from swinging. - What I can do, that I'll do. - It's a bargain. - By the way... Do you know why the doctor gave rne the chart? There's something under that, no doubt. - John, wore throwing you off! - The crew, in a council, according to the rules of the gentlemen o'fortune... ...decided to send you the black spot! - Turn it over, and read what it says. [ Deposed ] - You'll sing a different song now! - You're deposed, Silver! Get off that barrel! - Get off the barrel! - Kick him out! - Now listen to what I have to say. This boy is a hostage. And he, this boy, might be our last chance. - All right, what about the doctor? - Why did I let him and the others go? Here. - It's the real thing! - Here's Flints signature. - Yes, with a knot in it! - But how are we to get away? - We have no ship! - You ought to tell me that. You and the rest, that lost me my schooner! I found you the treasure. But you, you lost rne the ship. I don't care to be the captain of a bunch of idiots. I've had enough. - Silver! - Barbecue forever! - Gentlemen. Let's go look for treasure. - Whats the matter? - Whats happening? - He already found! - Found the treasure! - A skeleton! - He was a seaman. He's dressed in good sea-cloth. - Oh really? Who did you expect to find here? A bishop? However... why are the bones laid out so strangely? Oh, I think I get it. They are pointing to where the treasure is. Just take a bearing, will you. - South-West. - That means the Pole Star is there. - And there are the jolly dollars! - By thunder, it's one of Flint's little jokes. - These are the three tall trees.

Hello my clears! You don't look so good! Allow me to listen in... That's wonderful! Breathe deeper. Splendid! A bit hoarse, is it? Stomach droopy, liver completely shot, that's good. Excellent, excellent! Teeth now, let's see. Rotten, jolly good! Many missing, that's marvelous! Lads! You smoke way too much! With lungs like yours, you couldn't run a hundred yards. Remember! Smoking is bad for your health. [Song about the dangers of smoking] Columbus sailed into the west with fellow seamen folk. Upon returning from his quest He taught the world to smoke. It started from a pipe of peace he shared with the chief. But with it came a great disease: addiction to the leaf. As warns the Surgeon General: Tobacco's not a game! As warns the Surgeon General, As warns the Surgeon General: And Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus... and Columbus is not the one to blame. Columbus, though a clever man, knew none of what he did. Who knew tobacco flames would fan from China to Madrid. To smelling roses we prefer the smell of putrid smoke. And with it cancer, my good sir, and chance of early stroke. As warns the Surgeon General: Tobacco's not a game! As warns the Surgeon General, As warns the Surgeon General: And Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus... ...is not the one to blame! And as to me, I'm glad I quit, now fit and strong like bull -- To Surgeon General I bid my gratitude in full. Let's make "tobacco" a "taboo" No if, or when, or but. If we could do it, you can too kick smoking in the butt! Tobacco's not a game! As warns the Surgeon General, As warns the Surgeon General: And Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus... ...and Columbus... ...is not the one to blame! - And what will happen to me? - It's up to the judge. But I will keep my promise. - So it was you, Ben. - It was you who dug out the treasure. - One, two! One, two! One, two! Stop, one, two! - Hear my orders! Load the cargo! - One, two! One, two! One, two! Prepare to set sail! One, two! Check the top sail! Check the gaff sail! Raise the sails! One, two! Full speed ahead! It appears that we have made it to the final scene! And nobody (what a pity!) cared to do me in. I'm not destined to be hanging out up with a knife! I'm gentleman o'fortune! I'm gentleman o'fortune! In film and real life! In film and real life! - Just like real life? - Just like real life! Since the viewers like to watch the movies just like ours. Let us turn it up a notch and make it last for hours.
