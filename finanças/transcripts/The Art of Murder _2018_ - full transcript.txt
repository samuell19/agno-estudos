[dramatic music] [woman whimpering] [whimpering] [woman whimpering] [woman sobbing] [rattling] [instrumental music] [zip closing] [music continues] [music continues] Chris, doughnuts. Good morning. Good morning, Casey. Sugar, fat and carbs. The trifecta of perfect health. Besides, pink clashes with my hair. That's true, but it blends so well with your colorful personality. [Casey] Hm, do you always wake up this happy or did your doctor just increase your meds? [man] Kate. Yeah. Uh-huh. [telephone ringing] Gross. Yeah, okay. Bye. Is that vanilla sprinkles? Yes, it is. And I see that you've cleaned your desk. [laughs mockingly] Real funny. Uh, maybe we'll get lucky and get audited and then it's the IRS's problem. So tonight's a really big deal. You ready? It's not... that big of a deal. It's your first opening at our gallery. - It's a big deal. - [sighs] We should celebrate with an early drink. Oh, no, I don't, I don't, I don't think that's wise. I mean, I'm gonna be working up to that point and I brought my dress so I wouldn't have to run home to. - [Kate] So... - Okay. I mean, I mean, we can... - After everything is done. - Absolutely. Yeah. No, you're right. That's totally smart. No matter how many of these I do, I am a bundle of nerves. - So. - [Kate] Yeah. But tonight has to be a success. [exhales sharply] How are you so calm? Oh, no, I'm not. I-I'm nervous as hell. I've just been, um... focusing on the work, you know, the little things. - [Kate] Details. - Uh-huh. [Kate] So. [muffled] It's probably why I hired you. That or the doughnuts? I mean, maybe. The doughnuts are really good. [sighs] They are good. Yeah. Okay. - Oh, yeah. - Okay. Okay. Not gonna be a problem. [instrumental music] - [clattering] - [Kate sighs] [elevator whirring] [music continues] [music continues] [Casey] I've looked everywhere, but I just can't find a record of it. It looks like a rental bill, but it's the only one we have, and it just doesn't match anything else we have on file. Maybe the others were misplaced. Dad wasn't very organized. [Casey] Could you take this seriously, please? [man] And, hey, look, if it's that important, someone's gonna call and collect, eventually. There's not even a description. It's just an address. Maybe didn't want a paper trail, I mean, that address could be some guy's house where my dad bought pain killers. Look, do we have to talk about this, like, right now? Tonight? [Casey] You set the deadline for when you wanted this done by, not me. I'm actually trying to do the job that you are paying me for. Look, I'll just swing by the address on my way home tonight. Yeah, yeah. Great. Great. Perfect. Look, I have to go. Run a couple of errands. I'll be back in an hour. So just keep things moving while I'm gone? You got it. Hey. What was that about? Here's an idea. Why don't you do your job and I'll do mine? - [instrumental music] - [indistinct chatter] It's a bit sparse. It's early. You're an optimist. Back me up. [woman] Oh, hi. Nice to see you. Mom. Lovely to see you as always. Isn't it? A bit sparse. It's early. [woman] Since when are you the optimist? I'm learning. Hely, you look stunning. I'm an old weed compared to you, Kate. I love the dress. Very farmhouse chic. Thank you, I think. Isn't she gorgeous, Robert? Now, be a good boy and escort your mom to the bar. It's been wonderful, Kate. The pleasure's always mine. [indistinct chatter] Mr. Tiller. I'm Kate. - Hey. - I work here at the gallery. Oh. Okay. I just wanted to say I, I love your paintings. They're truly inspiring. Oh, it's a shame it didn't inspire more people to show up. I guess I can't really be surprised at the turnout. I mean, look at these people. They don't know the first thing about art. - Excuse me. - Yes, I am the artist. I'd like to speak to the lady. Oh. Right. You know, why waste time with art when you can just try and get laid? [Kate clears throat] One moment. [man] You're kind of an ass, aren't you? - Excuse me? - Yeah, I was wondering... Is it required to be tactless, um, self-absorbed to be an artist, so is that. Such as your brand? Can I steal you for a moment? I'm actually curious about another piece. Oh... Uh, I actually lied. I'm not interested in this, I just thought you needed a graceful exit from that creep. [chuckles] Yeah. - Thank you. - Hm. It took everything in me not to throw my cheap wine in his face. Oh, really? Then I stepped in too soon. - [laughing] - Sorry. No, you-you were perfect. [indistinct chatter] - What? - All right, uh, I'm... Hm, I've been searching for someone to take a look at a collection. - Really? - Mm-hmm. My grandfather's. He was a collector and he has dozens of paintings stuffed in the shed, and he left it all to me. - Well, Mr... - Sutter. - Daniel Sutter. - Kate Miller. [Casey] Are we flirting or are we working the floor? You know, I'm not seeing a lot of red dots on the wall. Red dots? She means sales. And she is being completely out of line. Casey. I know a qualified buyer when I see one. Casey, that's enough. Casey, don't you have an address you were gonna look into, some storage unit? Yes, on my way home. All right. Why don't you go look into that right now? - I'm just... - Right now, Casey. [indistinct chatter] Kate, you wanna introduce me? Um, all right. Uh, this is Daniel Sutter. - He has a collection... - Nice to meet you. That needs an appraisal, and this is the man in charge. She's not wrong. Daniel Sutter, come look at this collection. Excellent. Um... can I tell you it's... Well, we broke even tonight. Well, that's better than losing money. Yeah, but breaking even doesn't keep the doors open forever. And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky with that Daniel guy. - Essential client, Daniel? - Yeah. You... think he might have something valuable? I don't know. Well, maybe... Maybe his grandfather was a genius collector. I guess that more probable? I guess not. But it's really nice to dream. - Yeah. - [Robert sighs] I think you should do the scout tomorrow. Are you, are you serious? Yeah, you're not gonna be happy as an assistant forever. Why not get your feet wet? Oh... Thank you so much. I... - Thank you. - You've earned it. Just go up there in the morning, check out the collection and report back. If we're lucky, we'll find a few minor pieces. If not, then nothing lost. [stammering] I really can't tell you how much I appreciate this opportunity. I'm... I won't let you down. I'll text you the address. Okay. [engine revving] [car door shuts] [intense music] [chains rattling] [music continues] [Casey panting] [gasps] [Casey screams] [country song playing] [doorbell rings] ♪ It's not a good day [machine whirring] [doorbell rings] ♪ To find a way Daniel. ♪ Need you back home Hello? ♪ ...can't feel ♪ Oh oh Lord ♪ Daniel? - [Daniel] Hey. - Hey. Um, I knocked and rang the doorbell. Uh, and I heard music, so... It's all good. How are you? - I'm good. - Good. So what do you do? [inhales sharply] I'm a carpenter. Ah. Handyman. Yeah. I like to think so. I'm fixing up this place to put on the market. Oh, yeah, from what I saw out front, it looks really great. Thank you. I should hire you to fix my bedroom door. Every time I shut it, it just pops back open, and it's just driving me insane. - Yeah? Yeah. - Yeah. I think I can handle that. All right. - So... - So. - The collection. - The collection. - That's right. This way. - Okay. [chuckles] Please. Yeah, but those, um... Those actually aren't part of the collection. Those were my, my grandfather's paintings. He did 'em. Really? He was talented. That's, that's very kind of you. I'm sure, for cheap wall decorations, they'd do the trick. Um... I don't think you're giving him enough credit. He had serious talent. Fair enough. - Can I? - Please. These are, um... These are good examples. Were you and he close? Uh... Not... really. Thanks. He stayed here when the rest of the family went back East. I didn't see him much after that. I don't think he and my father were very close. I'm just glad I was here before he passed, you know, and that I could... take care of all this. I actually feel more connected to him in death than I did when he was alive. It's crazy, right? Do you know where he collected any of these? Yeah, most of the stuff is stuff he brought back from the war. - World War II? - Yeah. He was stationed in Belgium. And I guess, after Brussels was liberated, looting was in fashion. You like that one? It's Vermeer. Um, Johannes Vermeer. He was a Dutch painter from the 17th century. So is-is that a good one? Um, he was the greatest painter of the Dutch Golden Age. There's only 34 paintings known to exist. And... this is not one of them. So that is a good one. Well, it's probably a knock-off, but... if this is real, yeah, you're gonna need a lot better adjective than good. [instrumental music] Hey. You busy? How was the collection? I took photos. Not a bad size collection. It's interesting stuff. I don't think I'll have time. Do you think it's worth investing in? I mean... [sighs] I think it's big enough to turn in a small profit. Nothing too exceptional, but still... Oh, right, uh, except for the possibility of that being an authentic Vermeer. Huh. You better put a little bit more enthusiasm into that, "Huh." I would, I would love to, uh... Just the way this here's unfolding, I'm gonna proceed with caution. You know that the likelihood of this being real is very small. I mean, maybe, but even just... I mean, the thrill of the thought of that being real, I... [Robert scoffs] Okay, uh, schedule a pick-up for the collection and I'll talk to my authentication guy. In the meantime, let's just keep this on the deal for obvious reasons. Can do. Okay. Uh, Kate, did you see Casey out there? Uh, no. Why? You need something? No. No, no. I mean, I mean, she... She just didn't come in this morning. Uh... I mean, it's probably nothing, she was running an errand for me. I just wish she would've told me she was doing it. Well, I mean, that's Casey for ya. - True. Thanks, Kate. - [Kate] Yeah. [telephone ringing] Robert Krell's office. [Robert] Can you place a call for me? You're ten feet away. It's kind of enduring, though, isn't it, the whole, like, obnoxious bothering? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. How could I place your call, sir? I'd love it if you could call Daniel and see how soon we can come over. - We? - Yeah. If there's an actual Vermeer there, I need to know as soon as possible and I need my best eyes on it. [Robert] Degas? Uh, forgery, sadly. How can you tell? Kate. [clears throat] Well, despite the energy in his paintings, um, Degas focused on long, steady strokes. He captured fleeting moments, but with great patience. Our forger here seems to almost flick his brush with rustics. Oh. Also the signature. Between the G and the A, there'd most likely be a space where Degas would have taken a breath. Impressive, isn't it? Took me years to have an eye like that. Truth be told, I still don't. I mean, not like hers. You know, a guy may get the wrong idea when a girl drives an hour to see him twice in one day. Yeah? Well, don't worry. I'm just using you for your paintings. [Robert] Oh, wow. Uh... Well, I can't verify its authenticity, but... I certainly can't deny it. Daniel, I can officially say that the Hely Frank Gallery is interested in your collection. All right. So what do we do now? [elevator rumbling] [dramatic music] [electronic lock beeping] [music continues] [metal clangs] Hello? Robert? [Hely] Good morning. Kate, what are you doing down here? [sighs] I was just bringing a couple of things down. And of course, looking at the painting. [chuckling] [Kate] She's beautiful, isn't she? Are we smitten with the artwork or the possibilities? Maybe both. It's hard to separate the two in this instance. [Hely] Indeed. I would agree. I was showing my mom some of Daniel's grandfather's work that you're so taken with. And, uh, we wanna talk about taking it on. Really? Wow! That's-that's, that's great. Well, the story of being tied to the Vermeer, it might very well be worth it on its own. It's a bit of a gamble, but to hell with it. Do you think that he'd agree to it? I'm fairly certain I can convince him, but, uh... Okay, well, then, we just wanted to share that. I have a lunch. I'll leave you three ladies to some privacy. [chuckles] - [Hely] Bye. - See you. Kate... Robert tells me you have a good eye. I don't seem convinced. [sighs] I'm just having a hard time shaking off something I found in, uh, Daniel's house. It was a Degas painting, a forgery. And a bad one at that. I know, Robert told me about it. So now you're nervous that this is a forgery as well. [scoffs] But, uh, what does your gut tell you? Honestly? I mean, I want nothing more than for this painting to be real. [sighs] It would be incredible. But... Tsk, I just can't help but feel like something's wrong. Do you wanna know what I think? I think... that this is the first time in many, many years that a painting has made my heart race so fast. [door opens] [woman] Excuse me. Hi, I'm hoping to speak to Robert Krell. Um, he's actually in a call right now. Can I get your name? Detective Green. All right just give me one moment, okay? [Robert mumbling] [knocking on door] [Kate] Hey. [Robert] Hold on one second. [indistinct chatter] [Robert] Ben, I'm gonna have to call you back. Hey, you can go head in. - [Green] Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Hi. - Detective Green. - Robert Krell's office. - Hey there. Hi, Daniel. [chuckles] Can you guess why I'm calling? - Tsk, no clue. - So? What do you think? [Kate] Uh... I don't know, I just... I don't really think it's... Think of it as business, Kate. Client relations. You can even write it off. Well, uh... [Daniel] I'll take your silence as a yes? You know what? [chuckles] Sure. Why not? Oh, by the way, um, I think I was right about your grandfather's work. Robert thinks it may be worth something. - [Daniel] Hm, well... - You weren't expecting that. - Were you? - [Daniel] Uh, no. Okay. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye. [Robert] Thank you. - [Kate] You look worried. - Yeah. I... Uh, Casey's missing. Mi-missing? W-what do you mean, missing? She hasn't come home in two days. The detective thinks it's still too early, but she's asking around. - Two days? - Yeah. Oh, my God. I hope she's okay. Me, too. I'm gonna go for a walk. Clear my head. Can you look after things for me? Yeah, yeah. Of-of course. Yeah. Sure. [sighs] [doorbell rings] [door opens] Wow. [chuckles] Are you gonna invite me in? - Come in. - Yeah. What's going on in here? I told you I was remodeling. Right? Yeah, I was talking about the smoke. Oh, yeah. I, uh, burned dinner. - Huh. - But not to worry. - I have something even better. - Okay. I'm a terrible cook. I admit it. You know, we're lucky that the house is still standing. And you're lucky that I am a pizza girl. Well, real pizza. Not what passes for pizza here. Okay. So you're a pizza snob? Okay, once you have Chicago deep-dish, you'll understand. - Really? - Yeah, I mean... I'm sorry, but pizza should never have avocado on it. And why, why is that? Why, why can't it have avocado? Tell me. The whole point is that it's unhealthy. Why would you put avocado on it? You know, that's a really good point. - [both laughing] - That's a good point. I noticed you took your avocado off your pizza. [doorbell rings] That's weird. Um... Let me see who that is. Robert. [Robert] Hey. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. Robert, uh, what are you doing here? Well, I came to talk to Daniel about his grandfather's works. Um, I tried calling, but there was no answer for him or you. I've clearly come at a bad moment. No. No, no, no. We're just having pizza. - Come have pizza with us. - [Daniel] Yeah. Come on. Take my seat. - Great, thank you. - Yeah. - [Kate clears throat] - Ah, thank you. Do you like pizza with avocado? I don't. [Robert] Regardless of the Vermeer, I think the paintings would do quite well. If nothing else, they'll hang in the home of some appreciative collector. Yeah. The... Um, they're not worth anything. [chuckles] Well, now who's the art expert? No. No, what I'm saying is it's... [chuckling] Okay. I'm just... Uh, maybe I've grown emotionally attached to them. I've never considered it a prospect. I completely understand that. And we're not here to pressure you into anything. I just thought you'd be flattered. I did, too. Uh, I am. I am. It's just a... It's a surprise. That's all. Nobody's ever showed any interest before. Before when? I'm just, uh, saying that the pictures are still hanging in the wall. Right? I mean, it's not like he could've sold them or wanted to. I guess I'm-I'm just, I wasn't prepared for any of this. Well, I came here tonight because I showed some photos to some clients and they were more than interested, which, I think, is a great indicator. Wow. Really? How about this? I'll put together some paperwork, give you the night to think it through. Again, there's no pressure. I just think it's a great opportunity to take advantage of the interest that Vermeer is gonna generate. All right, well, thank you for coming by. Thank you very much for, uh, having me, us. - Yeah. - We'll talk soon. - For sure. Drive safe. - Yeah. - Robert, I... - Please. You don't need to explain. Your private life is just that. Just be careful. This is a very important client. Okay? Okay. Goodnight, Kate. - [sighs] - [cell phone vibrating] Hi. - [Daniel] Oh, hey. Long time. - Hm. [Daniel] That was a bit, um, awkward. Yeah. Yeah, my cooking was an epic fail and Robert showing up was just so... Yeah. - Mm... - Daniel, listen... [Daniel] So how about I make it up to you? No more cooking. Let's just, let's just go to some place really nice. Where-where do all the art snobs go? I'm sorry, I just think I'm so stressed right now with the show prep and everything, it's... [Daniel] It's okay. Oh, God. Please don't hate me. Do you hate me? I'm just... I just need to take tomorrow and lock myself inside and-and work. I-I don't hate you, Kate. I'm not even gonna have time to eat, let alone stop and-and-and go somewhere. [Daniel] Kate, it's, it's okay. I don't hate you. I'm sorry, I just think that I-it's better this way. [Daniel] Okay. [dramatic music] [eerie music] [music continues] [panting] [siren wailing] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] [sighs] Don't be mad. Okay? I... I got your address out of the notebook you conveniently left at my place. It seemed important. I tried calling. Um, I thought you might need it... for work. I do. Thanks. I also remember you saying you weren't gonna have time to eat. So I brought you some sustenance. Authentic deep-dish. Okay, look, I'm not gonna bother you. All right, I just, I wanted to bring back your notebook and make sure you had something to eat, and I also brought my toolbox to look at your door if you wanted me to, but... [inhales sharply] Just get back to whatever you were doing. What do you know about authentic deep-dish? I know it shouldn't have avocado. - This better not have avocado. - It doesn't. [Daniel sighs] Okay. Okay. - Moment of truth. - All right. Stand back. - Oh, my God. - [door opens] - [door shuts] - [Kate chuckles] Oh, my God. That-that-that is, that is amazing. Yeah, you see, ruining dinner's not the only thing I'm good at. [Kate sighs] You know, this is a... pretty smooth way to get into a girl's bedroom. [both chuckling] Yeah, I should get going. Yeah, no. Definitely can't stay. That's why I'm clearly leaving. Yeah, no. I, I hope you have a great night. Yeah, I... probably... left something in the oven... back home. You really are a horrible cook, though. [chuckling] You just wait till I make you breakfast. [chuckles] [instrumental music] [siren wailing] [music continues] [telephone ringing] [grunts] [telephone ringing] Hely Frank Gallery. This is Kate. Hey, Kate. It's Robert. [Kate] Robert! How are you? Oh, wow, somebody's chipper despite being at the office on a Sunday night. [chuckles] No, I'm just, uh, just getting excited for everything, that's all. Great. And the deliveries? Uh, last one went out a couple of hours ago. Perfect. Hey, thanks again for covering for me. I would've been there if I could. Yeah, of course, that's what you pay me the big bucks for, right? [chuckling] Yeah. Hey, um, did you hear anything on Casey? No, the detective said she'd call if they found something, but... I mean, it's been four days. I'm starting to get worried. Me, too. We all are. I promise, if I hear something, I'll give you a call. Okay. Thanks, Robert. All right. [sighs] [melancholy music] [music continues] [chains clanking] [music continues] [intense music] Oh, God. [music intensifies] [screams] [indistinct chatter] Tell me again. What made you go there? [typewriter keys clacking] I don't know. [sniffles] The night that Casey went missing, she had told me [sniffles] That she found something. Uh, a receipt. I don't know what information was on that receipt. Uh, then-then an address. And I remembered that at the end of that night she was sent to that address. So... I retraced her steps, I guess. You said she was sent there. By whom? [Daniel] That's crazy. Do you think Robert had anything to do with it? No. I mean, he loved her. Not like that, but... I don't know, just... None of it, none of it makes sense. I'm sure the cops are gonna take care of it. I just can't believe she's gone. I just can't get it out of my head. Hey. Come here. I wanna show you something. This way. [instrumental music] [door opens] [Daniel] This was his studio. This is... this is amazing. [chuckles] I mean, to think about how much... creativity and how much... passion was right here in this room... Have you given Robert's proposal anymore thought? I, I just, I really think that these paintings need to be seen. You really think they're that good? I believe in them. Yeah. I mean, you think it, they'll sell? Robert thinks so. And so do I. Yeah. [chuckles] Okay. - Yeah? - [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. I'll be great. Trust me. That was his last painting. What's the H stand for? Hawthorne. Nathaniel Hawthorne Sutter. Apparently, my great-grandmother was a big reader. He, uh, didn't get to finish? No. Unfortunately, he got sick. It's sad, really. He said that this was gonna be his greatest work. He called it The Muse. Maybe you should keep this one... yourself. What happened right here? What do you mean? This newer paint doesn't match the fade of the rest of the painting. It's also raised a little bit, which means it's a new layer. I thought you said you didn't paint. I don't, I don't paint. It's, uh... [chuckles] It's actually embarrassing. Okay. Before he died, I asked him for a painting. A present to a girlfriend that I had at the time. The relationship didn't end well. And when you guys were gathering up all the paintings, I rediscovered this one. And I didn't wanna donate it. I also didn't wanna look at her face every day either, so... I touched it up a little. It's a... It's a pretty good touch-up for someone who doesn't paint. Hey, hey. No. I'm sorry. Just... I just think, with [sighs] everything happening with Casey, I just... A little weirded out, that's all. I better go. You don't want to stay? I, I do wanna stay. - But I better go. - Okay. [door shuts] [instrumental music] [keyboard keys clacking] Oh, I, I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean to startle you. No. I'm-I'm sorry. Just... After everything with Casey, I've just been a little jumpy. I know. And Robert, my poor son. The police is still holding him for questioning. It's absolutely ridiculous. So, well, they're wasting everybody's time. You're stuck here with me for the day. I brought Ben. - Ben? - Upchurch. Old friend. Sweet man. From Art Experts. - Oh. The authenticator. - Yes. - We're doing that today? - Of course. I'm not waiting for another day to see if our Vermeer is the real McCoy. I can't tell you how excited I am to hear what you think. I would caution your enthusiasm. I've not had the privilege of delivering good news of this proportion very often. Sadly. [Hely] We shouldn't be long. Oh. Okay. Um, I'll be up here if you need me. Fingers crossed. [cell phone vibrating] [instrumental music] [sighs] [keyboard keys clacking] [Kate] Wait, what? July? [footsteps approaching] [Kate] So? [sighs] Well... I don't need to tell you how convincing it looks, but, um, until we've run a few more tests, uh, taken some samples, X-rays, carbon dating, that sort of thing, I, uh, prefer not to speculate. Well, if it's, uh, if it's all right with the two of you, I'll have the painting picked up, uh, tomorrow afternoon? - Yes, of course. - Good. And, uh, we should have our answer in about a week. [Hely] Ah, well, we'll be looking forward to it very much. - Take care, Ben. - Mwah. Thank you, Hely. Thank you. Kate, again, it was lovely to meet you. I'll see you next week. - [exhales sharply] - Bye. I know. Waiting is the hardest part. No, it's, uh... It's not that. While you were downstairs, I tried to get a clear picture of the provenance. I found Daniel's grandfather's service records. None of it matched what Daniel told me. - Kate... - I know. I know. Okay? I've... I know I've barely looked into it. But his grandfather was wounded and discharged in July of 1944. And Daniel said that he found the painting in Brussels. But American troops didn't get there until September. Kate! I don't wanna sound insensitive, but you've had a scare and it's making you paranoid. Now listen. Our gallery needs this painting. And until I have a scientific proof stating otherwise, I'm going to believe my eyes and my heart. And I'm going to trust that this is an honest-to-God Vermeer. So please, just hold off judgement until we know for sure. Okay. I'm sorry for snapping. I'm letting excitement get the better of me. Why don't you take the night off? I'm grabbing drinks with Daniel to discuss the opening and, clearly, nobody's coming anytime soon. Get some rest. Think happy thoughts, please. Okay. Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a handsome man waiting for me. I'll tell him you said hello. Okay. [melancholy music] [intense music] [crickets chirping] [music continues] [door opens] [music continues] [intense music] [switch clicks] [music continues] [gasps] [music intensifies] [panting] [door opens] [door shuts] [cell phone chiming] [cell phone vibrates] [cell phone vibrates] [dramatic music] Hey, Kate! - Kate! - No! [Daniel groans] Kate! Kate! Kate! [Kate panting] Kate! Kate! - Wait! - [engine revving] Hi. Hi. Come on in. How was your week off? It was, it was good. I feel like I finally, uh, have my head on straight. Glad to hear it. Look, I just wanna apologize. I... I'm sorry for bringing up your name. I mean... I didn't think that you would get detained and for that long. Uh, I'm sorry. Okay. You'd just found Casey and we were all pretty shaken. I really messed things up, didn't I? Mm-hmm. Okay. There is some good news, though. I heard back from the authentication expert about the Vermeer. And it's legit. Hold... Huh? I think you need a little bit more enthusiasm behind that, "Huh." No, I mean... But this is incredible. Yeah, I wanted to call you when I found out, but I decided I wanted to see your face instead. [chuckles] So... what does this mean? Uh, it means that after we auction this Vermeer off, we have a lot of work to do. We created a local hub for discovering new talent. Robert is going to immortalize it. To you, darling. And to you, Kate. And to Ben, the best authenticator we've ever had the privilege of befriending. - [Hely] Cheers. - Cheers. [glasses clinking] Mm. Aren't we missing a key component here? What about the young man who donated the painting? Yes. Where is Daniel? Daniel doesn't wanna spend time with a bunch of art nerds, mom. Nonsense. Come on, give me the phone. [Hely] Thank you. Daniel. This is Hely Krell. I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because if you do, you're canceling them. So as it turns out, it was not Greek, it was not Roman. It was Etruscan. [Ben] Etruscan Arch. - Yes. - Daniel! - On the Greek... - We must catch up. [Daniel] How are you? Mwah. [Hely] What happened? Daniel, this is the good consultant with the authentication company that verified your Vermeer. Ben Upchurch, meet Daniel Sutter. It's very good to meet you. Yeah, I'll bet. Congratulations on your good fortune sitting on this gold mine. And that provenance, that's a story that'll sell, hm. Ben and his team were able to trace the painting all the way to Nathaniel's platoon. - Really? - Yes. I reviewed the whole thing myself. It was a trail full of twists and turns, but, uh, it's all there. [Hely] Let's have a toast. To timeless masterpieces. - And of course, to the new ones. - New ones? Daniel was gracious enough to offer the gallery to represent his grandfather's work as well. Really? - Hear, hear. - [glass clinks] - Thank you, Daniel. - Of course. Thank you. Uh, excuse me. [clears throat] [siren wailing] [instrumental music] - May I join you? - Of course. Look, I am mortified about what happened. I really am, and I-I wanted to call and explain myself, but... Honestly, I had no idea what to say. How could I be mad? I did lie to you. Your grandfather's not the artist in the family. [chuckles] Why lie about that? I've never had a lot of faith in my abilities. When on his deathbed, my grandfather asked for one thing, that I share my work with the world. After he died, I didn't wanna disappoint him. I still wasn't ready to show that side of myself. So when I approached your gallery, I came up with the idea to say the work was his. That way, we could both be happy. - You are an odd man. - [chuckles] But your work is beautiful. Truly. I don't know what to say to that. Say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Really. Thank you. [Daniel] Thank you. [instrumental music] [Robert] Feeling funny 'cause he didn't wanna be the talk of the town. Eat that, Christie's. I'm really happy for you, Robert. Oh, no, it wasn't just me. You're the one who found it. In fact... I think you more than earned this. Go ahead, open it. Really? Uh, wh... Thank you so much. - Congratulations. - [chuckles] This gallery is now your playground. I promise you, I'm gonna kill this job. Oh, I know. But first... Uh... Let's have a drink to celebrate. - Yes. - [chuckles] Let me guess. You have a bottle in your desk. - You know me so well. - Yeah. Let's drink to the artist. - Okay. - Okay. Be out there in a second. [instrumental music] [Robert] Oh, people are already here. Everything okay? Yeah. Whoa. You okay? You don't look so good. Actually, uh, if you don't mind, I think I'm gonna take a minute and go downstairs to clear my head. Okay. Uh, one of the keycard readers is on the fritz, so you have to use the keypads. - 6-1-9-1. - Sorry, what? Yeah, I know, he uses the same code for everything. It's not the best security measure to use your anniversary, but, um, I'll fix it. It's being fixed, though. - It's fine. - Okay. I should go get changed, anyway. [keypad beeps] [door unlocks] [indistinct chatter] That's great, very... Can I speak to you for a moment? - Yes. Um, would you excuse me? - Okay. Please. I can't, I can't do this. I think, well, I think we're gonna have to pull this... Come on. Let's go. Let's go. [indistinct chatter] - It's... - Shh... [indistinct chatter] Everything's all right. [indistinct chatter] [Ben] Quiet. Just be quiet. [indistinct chatter] [door creaking] [Daniel] I can't, I can't, I can't... [Ben] Shh! I'm not going back up... It's fine, it's fine. - [Ben] Keep your voice low. - [Daniel] Oh. Okay, uh... - [Ben] What's the problem? - [Daniel] Problem is... - [Daniel] Is that I'm done. - [Ben] What does that mean? [Daniel] It means I'm pulling the painting, Ben. - I'm pulling the painting. - [Ben] Heh-heh. Why? - [Ben] Are they suing you? - I don't wanna go to prison. They're looking at my work, okay? It's something I've strived for my whole life. I've finally broken through and now I have this voice in my head saying, "You're gonna go to prison." [Ben] Just think this through. You pull a new Vermeer from auction moments before the auction starts. You think the international art community is going to just turn a blind eye to that? [indistinct chatter] [Ben] We have created a perfect forgery with my knowledge and your hands. We sell the painting. No one's going to question. If you want to go to prison, go ahead, pull it right now. Go ahead. Let me see. I know this world, I know these people. I'm fine. Fine... It's going to be just... [thudding] We should get back upstairs. Yeah. [gasps] [whimpers] [Daniel] This wasn't supposed to happen. You know... [sighs] It doesn't have to be like this, you could just... - [Kate sobbing] - You can go along with it. You're not gonna scream, right? [grunts] [whimpering] [Kate groans] You and I... we make a hell of a team. Now imagine that with a few million dollars. And you still get to save the gallery. If they find out, all that goes away. You do know that the gallery is bleeding money, right? Robert inherited a sinking ship. You're a thief and a liar. I am an artist. And you... are the reason that I believe in my work now. [Kate sobbing] You were there when Robert sent Casey off. You killed Casey. That was unfortunate. But I had to make sure that Frank didn't leave anything incriminating back at the storage unit after he died. Frank? Robert's, Robert's father? Who do you think commissioned the Vermeer? He was so desperate to save the gallery... It's unfortunate, in the end, stress killed him. Don't let that be you. The auction's about to start. What do you wanna do here? Tell you what. Why don't you think about... how beautiful our future could be together? You as a chief curator at Hely Frank and me as your discovery. Maybe after you hear how rich we are, you'll reconsider, hm? I'm gonna come back to check up on you. Okay? - [Kate gasps] - Soon. [indistinct chatter] There's the man of the hour. How are you feelin'? I'm feeling pretty good. I hear that, that she'll make quite the sale. I hope so. And then, after all this is settled down, we still have your grandfather's work to showcase. I'm sure he would be very proud. - I hope so. - [chuckles] - Have you seen Kate? - No. I haven't. - [Kate grunting] - [thudding] [auctioneer] Tonight's featured work and the reason you're all here has been making headlines in the art world for weeks now. Tonight, we will all, myself included, feast upon a long-lost Johannes Vermeer. It's been titled The Intruder. Ladies and gentlemen, bidding will start at five million dollars. - [thudding] - [Kate grunting] Do I hear nine million? Nine million? Nine million. Lovely. Thank you, sir. 9.5. Anyone, 9.5? There we go. Ten, ten million? - The girl? - Ten million dollars? Yeah, she's alive. - [thuds] - [Kate grunts] [panting] [Daniel] I need you to go check in on her. - [chuckles] No. - Thirteen, thirteen? Good. I'm not getting into this any deeper than I already am. - Fourteen million dollars. - You go. - I can't. - Fourteen million dollars. [auctioneer] Do I hear fifteen? [Daniel] I'm the seller. I need to be here when the painting is bought. Do you really want someone to go down there and find her screaming in a box? [auctioneer] Sixteen million dollars. Sixteen million dollars going once. Seventeen, seventeen million dollars. Seventeen, seventeen million. 17.5. No. [breathing heavily] - [clears throat] - [groans] [Ben groaning] Keycard. [groans] [Ben] No! No, no! [screaming] No! Come back! No! No! Stop! [indistinct yelling] [auctioneer] Yeah. Eighteen million. Wonderful. A very good purchase. Anyone? Eighteen million, nineteen million. Nineteen million dollars. We have twenty million dollars. Twenty million dollars going once. Going twice. And twenty one million dollars. Twenty one million dollars. Do I hear 21.5? [dramatic music] [grunts] - [grunts] - [groans] [Daniel] Come here. - [grunts] - [Kate panting] - [Kate groaning] - [grunting] [Kate choking] - [grunts] - [Daniel groans] [breathing heavily] [both grunting] [coughing] - [grunts] - [groans] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [auctioneer] ...right, good. Twenty eight million. Do I hear twenty nine, twenty nine? Fair warning. Twenty nine million. I have twenty nine million! I have twenty nine and a quarter million dollars going once... - [Kate] Stop. - [auctioneer] Going twice. Stop. It's a... - It's a fake. - I'm sorry? It's a... [audience gasping] Are you okay? Somebody call 911, please! [indistinct chatter] [Robert] Kate, Kate, are you okay? [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [Robert] Morning. - Good morning. - May I? So... tonight's the night. Tonight's the night. You nervous? No. I'm ready. All right. [Hely] It's very brave that you're doing this. It speaks of your character. I mean, Daniel may not have been a great man, but he was a great artist. And it's, it's about the art. I must ask. What's with the display? [Kate] Every single painting in this collection is a forgery. Or it was. They were all Daniel's practice runs. [Hely] Incredible. Incredible. Whoa. He became quite the figure in the artistic community. Gifted disturbed genius who forged a Vermeer and then died for his art. I imagine, the gallery will do well tonight. [Kate] I hope so. [Hely] I'll give you a moment. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues]
