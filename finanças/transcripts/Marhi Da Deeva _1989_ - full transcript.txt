Shall I show you? - Show. It was a flashing glimpse She has not returned the worth of the sweetmeat Come on. How are you, buddy? All right! How are you? Great. Share the grub. - You go ahead. | am going round the fields. - Fine. Come on. Step in. Why are you peeping like thieves? | came to see N.|kka He just went out Didn't you come across him?

Love has made twists. Love has made twists. Heart is getting stuck in the twists. Heart is getting stuck in the twists. Love is crazy. Love is crazy. Without seeing her face.. ...I don't feel like passing from there. Red fairy is gone into me. My heart cries for her. Why are you ruining your health? Speak your mind | am your friend. - There is nothing to say Have I ever hidden anything from you? Swear by God and tell me have I hidden anything from you? No. There is nothing.. - Why are you making a fool of me? You are ruining yourself since you fall for her Who has fallen for her? You have been speaking around her house, since she left To fall in love is not a sin Everyone knows that Nikka can't do anything. This is a job of a man. | am happy you have some pep and courage Why are you beating about the bush! Just beat around the bush! Hello, aunt. Uncle! How are you? | am ready to depart We will not let you go. Jagsir is just bringing the doctor. If doctors could save us then no one would die. | had called you so that... Yes, tell me. What is the matter? Don't keep any secret. How are you? Bear with it Why feel the pulse? The journey is over Nothing is wrong with you. Take this medicine. Give it with warm water Dharm Singh! | have given the medicine. But trust in God Whatever God wishes will happen. Fulfil his wish Have some offerings made to the poor Now he.. Well uncle, what is the matter? Dharm Singh! | had called you so that... Speak out. I am just like your son Praise be yours! Praise be yours! Can anyone else behave with me the way you have? | have to hand over his responsibility to you Why are you talking like that? You have a lot to do yet. Treat him like your brother.. ...the way your father treated me Keep your hand on his head. Take care of him from now on See him married and settled in life QK. As you wish May God bless you. One thing for you, Jagsir... Look after the sheesham tree... ...and make my marhi under the tree O.K! I'll make a move You keep in touch Aunt! Don't worry It shall be all right God almighty! Give me strength to carry out your will. And bless me so that I can fulfill my oath. Brother! - Jagsir? Brother! Father.. Jagsir! Father has left us Brace yourself. Who can avoid this? Oh God! Leaving us behind... ...which distant land have you departed to? | told you so many times. Insisted you to do something... ...to have a grandson to touch your bier Now we'll not get salvation If you had spent some money, we wouldn't see this day You have gone away easily, now what will I do? Oh God.. Punjabo told me... What Punjabo has said | know... ...but do you know how much land my father had... ...when he took uncle Thole to work... ...and how much it is now? Land must have multiplied belonging to many people... ...but did anyone make a marhi of a share-cropper? What right do you have over the land? These four bighas of land my father had given them... Sheesham tree was planted by uncle Thola... ...and he has nursed it like his own child Does this transfer the land to their name? When it is given to them, why transfer? How can they become owners without that? Who can become the owner of the earth? Earth is the master of all Has anyone brought it at birth ...or taken along at death? You just keep giving lectures. You'll become a recluse, leaving us in the lurch Come, have your food What is the matter Dharm Singh? You are so worried. A wind of change is setting in. It may uproot everything Sometimes, along with the trees the roots are also uprooted. May I say something? You've not done well in making Thola's marhi in your fields What's wrong with that, Jeona? The land belongs to Thola, and the tree is also his | am only doing my duty Sometimes it is better to watch your interest Look at the way the world is moving | cannot do that | am telling you as a friend... ...that it may not disintegrate your own house Dharm Singh had given 4 acres of land to Jagsir. He made a marhi on it too.. But making a marhi now is inauspicious. You know a marhi is made.. ...in the remembrance of a person. Wonder what the matter is. He knows Jagsir will not get married. He has made a lot of efforts. But what Jagsir must be going through. He is doomed. You have taken your share, why are you cutting more fodder? It is only a handful | spend for the seeds and the manure, and you take all Leave it here, otherwise it won't be good. What is the matter? These share-croppers are crossing the limit Things are changing. Share- croppers are becoming obsolete It is due to rising prices You are right, Bhanta Wonder where this inflation will take us. Bless you. You let him take the bullocks after I had refused You know very well that this is our tradition Won't you change this thirty year old tradition? I cannot do this I have to honour my word Who stops you from doing that! They work and eat... ...they think they are the owners of the land You know well these 4 bighas your grandfather gave them I thought it would end after his death... ...you have made his marhi in the fields Look the way the world is changing People have started working on contract and daily wages I'll do it Watch the times. You are not watching the times. People with less land are buying tractors... ...we are goading bullocks Have you ever thought of their feelings? Nandi would die of shock We'll not hang them They work and get their wages Don't be rash! Don't forget the word of honour I gave That's why I have waited so long Have patience! I'll do what you want He will not listen. That old woman has charmed him. | am patient since he is my father, ...after all, I've waited so long Let us see for some more time Darling daughter, what type of husband would you like? My dear daughter. Well, darling daughter | have found a smart guy. | have found a smart guy. Dear father, | want a smart guy. Well, darling daughter | have found a smart guy. | have a prince For my darling daughter. Bhani darling... It is by God's grace that we are married Where is mother? How would I know? Do you both ever tell me where you go! | know that you are annoyed with me... ...because I don't tell you where I go Don't worry about me. | know you love me very much My love! I can't eat without seeing you Ah my darling! What can I do! The whole village waits for me Yes! Because you scrub their utensils well Don't get impatient I'll return soon Sister-in-law! Give me my doll I'll give it to you. First tell me... - What? ...who came that day? Those to whom I showed your face? One was Geba, and the other... Who stayed behind, the tall one? That one! His name is Jagsir He is very nice. He gave me sweets He was asking about you. Sister-in-law! Give me my doll Take the doll. Seebo! What is this? - A doll! It is a beautiful doll. Who gave it to you? Sister-in-law gave it to me. Is that so. Is Nikka at home? Nikka? No. He and mother have gone to attend a marriage Okay. You go and play with the doll. Nikka! Nikka! Nikka. Are you at home? Nikka. Nikka. Who is there? Jagsir. | wanted to meet Nikka. Was there any work? No! Yes! Some work... Can't you tell me... Come on! Sit for a while I will get water for you. I-- You fool! God has given you good looks, ...hasn't he given you courage? Let us exchange a glance, at least O.K!'l go Let your husband come! You'll get it from him This bitch has slurred my name Who is he of yours? Why don't you speak? - Oh God! That is why you ignored me Now you are happy? Tell me. Oh God! - They have sent this bitch to our house. She is flirting with that guy. Call him now. You shameless bitch! | won't spare you. | will change my name if I don't teach you a lesson You call me pygmy! You call me pygmy! You call me pygmy! A handful of money was not given for this How dare he come to my house. What is the matter Jagsir? What is the matter? I'll crush that bastard You look very angry today. | have overheard everything What? - I will break his hands. Where are you going, Jagsir? Get lost. Hey Nikka! Come out Come out Nikka Rascal. What is the matter? - I'll tell you what the matter is Do you want to give your sister to me? Come out of your mother's lap! We'll see who takes whom! Go back! Go back! Come out! I'll take your sister! I'll take your mother, you bastard! Wait don't go. How dare he, this dog! He comes to my house! | say, leave me. Stop. - You rascal. You beat a woman. Go away. This is all because of you! You have got me insulted. You will be cursed. He is hiding inside just like a girl. What does he think? Hitting a woman. Come on. Let it be. Come on. We will talk to him later. Aunt! This is bad indeed let us not, prolong the matter And Nikka, you also listen Hush up the matter It would be nice if you could advice Jagsir For that we'll talk to Dharm Singh He will handle. - Explain to him. If he were alive, he would die of shock Or he would have drowned himself Stop this, mother You won't get any blame for the rest of your life My stigma has not been removed as yet... ...and you have brought on another The major hindrance is Nandi's parents They ask about the parents and immediately say... ...the same Nandi who eloped with Thola Come to the point now. What is the response from your relative? Had proposed to my sister-in-law's daughter. But... Come on! Be frank They want that the four bighas of land... ...being cultivated by Jagsir be transferred to his name Will this wash off Nandi's stigma? My father tried his best to transfer it to Thola's name... ...the rule of the land did not permit it My present position you know Think over it The choice is yours Money, land, property... ...Is this the end of everything? Shall man ever be considered as man? There shall be no caste, no creed Is that why people call you God? You have got me humiliated Rascal! What had I done to you What is the matter? Santo has eloped with someone She was always too lively Please! Go away! Why are you tormenting me! Don't make fun of him Go your way Let's go. The times are very bad. Why should she have eloped like that? | pity Ronki He danced attendance on her But he failed. Her only problem was that she could not have an issue She prayed, but it was all in vain A woman's worth is accepted with a child only Harder. Come on harder. Brother.. These grains are not to be taken to the market Bhanta told us to load them What is the matter? You know that grains of our fields are never sold You load it. It is not his father's property Don't abuse Bhante - I'll do what I wish That'll not be good - What will you do? Move back. Let Dharm Singh come I'll abide by his word Now my word shall prevail. Keep it. I'll not let the grains go to the market Will you move back or no? Useless fellow. Watch your mouth. Watch my mouth with you.. Should I wear garlands for you? Move aside. I say move aside. | say.. All of them have been pampered. Move aside. - I will raise my hand on you. You dare to.. Move aside. Load it. | had said and gone that first give Jagsir his share. First we give them their plough. First give them water. All these things have pampered them. Otherwise how dare a servant speak in front of his boss. The land which you think you are the owner of.. ...they consider it as their mother. Thola uncle used to consider the seeds as his children. That's why I say, have patience. We have had a lot of patience, father. Then beat them and throw them out of the house. If this continues, then | will have to think about this matter. Now you have had your way for long. Since we have been working with them.. ...or we keep grains to eat at home, it's a problem. Get up. Have tea and have your medicine too. Nandram had given the medicine in the morning. Take this. Take. My knees are giving trouble. You take care of your health. Jagsir. Brother, you here at this time? Thought I will meet you and go. Take this. Keep it. What is this? - The money of your share of the grains. Keep it. No brother. There is no need for this. Whatever has happened let it pass. Keep this quietly in your pocket. I will do whatever I can. Later there will be no problem. Jagsir, take care of your health. This liquor will kill you. | have spoken at some place. Hopefully it will succeed. About what? Crazy! Can you lead your life like this. Don't lose hope. Jagsir! Bhani! Bhani! You have come | was confident that you would come | longed to hear your footsteps Where were you? Why did you take so long? Every moment my heart throbbed for you... ...but I was afraid of what people would think Those who love, never fear anyone If you are not afraid why should I fear anyone! Bhani! You taught me to live You enkindled the flame of love in me. Now I can openly express my love for you Yes. I love Bhani. | wish to see my beloved. One goes crazy. A partition is created in hearts. A partition is created in hearts. | am so lonely. Love is crazy. Love is crazy. Love does not look behind. It just moves ahead. | may be unhappy. | may be unhappy. My beloved should not be hurt. Love is crazy. Love is crazy. Do you live in the village? Where shall I go! | have come after 2 years.. ...and it is fifteen days since I have come. Didn't you feel like meeting me! Why do you blame me, Bhani! Many a time I thought of meeting you, but... You didn't have the courage.. ...but I've come to share your woes My brothers were not allowing me to come to this hell | have come with my hopes on you. I'll go back if you wish How can you do that! What have you done to yourself! Without you everything, Bhani. Without you everything changed Everything has become lifeless within me | can breathe life into you if you desire Have the guts. Why live in sin! Why get blemished! These acts are never forgiven Already past sins are weighing heavily on us Why add more to it! If meeting of two hearts is a curse.. ...what is a blessing then! Who can alter.. ...the writing of fate! Is it only for us that fate has written all that is ill! Is ill luck only for us? Of the rich, even the Goddess of fate is afraid They grease her palms What have we to give! This tin of opium Take. | somehow passed ten or twelve years with Santo... ...that rascal has discarded you for ever Who to complain to! We have no one in both the worlds Those on this earth are for the rich... ...and the one above is also not with us. Stop it! Let it be. We can't cope with it be losing heart like this This is the writing of fate. Who can escape the cycle of Karma You have given all the pleasures to the rich... ...incestuous Bastard! Divide equally the pain, at least Bhanta's marriage was to take place. It's about that? His marriage was over yesterday Then it may be about Bachittar's son's marriage Has he a son of marriageable age? Yes! The one with slimy eyes Rascal! Keeps a stammering the whole day He is getting married. Marriages are not made between persons Marriages are made between lands, riches and houses You are absolutely right. This voice seems like that of our Bhani Forget it pal! Scrubbing your utensil, hey! No problem. These thoughts prevail in big houses Why did he get five hundred? | suspect he gave it to Jagsir That way he'll reduce us to ashes At every step, money is needed To book a tractor we need money They hand over the bill for a sack of manure To install a pump we need money Barter of grains doesn't get anything What are you doing? Mind your words please! Why did you get five hundred from the dealer? Who told you? | have seen the account book myself Now you both have stooped to that Was this property made by you or your mother? My right on this inherited property is equal to yours If you persist in your ways, you divide the land... ...and you can throw your share to the dogs You have lived your life. | have just begun How can I give up those... ...who have toiled for us throughout their lives? I never thought Bhanta will come to that | feel like separating him... ...but who'll face the gossip of the people By dividing the land you cannot stop the changing times You should flow along with the current of time | told you this when you had made the Marhi Then noble deeds have no place in life Money! Land! Property! These are the end of life Well! That is the writing of fate... ...God's decree Call it what you may, it is the trend of the times No one can stop it Go with the time.. or else its in front of you. You asked as a friend so I told you. Now do what you wish. You are sensible. | understand How can I undo the noble deeds done during my life time? Oh gosh! Jagsir. My son, take this! Bring eight annas worth of rice and jaggery Take this | am left with only one rupee With that, buy me a shroud when I am dead I'll not put a cheap shroud on you... ...but a silken shawl worth fifty rupees A shawl of silk or flannel! That won't obtain salvation for me You are always evasive. Ask me. But I'll become a ghost after death... ...there is no grandson to touch my bier Grandsons don't bring salvation. It is brought by money The job should be done before Jagsir reaches the fields Don't worry! It will be over before dawn My men are very skilled at wielding weapons The root is very deep. Seems it was planted with great care. - Do it fast. Who is it? Stop! You rascal! Don't beat me! I did not do anything. Don't beat me. Don't beat me. Have you cut this tree? We were told to do it. We have not done it according to our wish. Shah told you. - We don't know whose it is. Rascal. Have you seen it! You toiled for them your whole life | also worked for them Hey, Dharm Singh! What have you done? You should have thought, before doing this I'll burn myself at your threshold! Oh Dharm! What did you do? Aunt! What is the matter? Don't curse here in the lanes. Come inside Come, come inside. Come inside. Dharm.. Come, sit here. Now tell me. You should have kept your word Why did you rake up his ashes! You are just like my son You felled his tree. He had nursed it like his children What did you do? You dog! Our tree, was it born with your husband? As if you are the owner. We have cut the tree. Let me see what you will do. No one has cut your tree I'll see. Everything shall be all right Why did you do it? What did you get! | told you, no one has cut your tree Get up. Come. Come. Go home. Come. - What have you done, Dharm? Come, I will drop you home. Come. Don't worry. Being hard of hearing | can't even understand clearly Aunt, don't worry. - Jagsir told me that the tree was felled You.. How is Aunt now? She is so shocked... ...that she has not eaten since four days Nand Lal said that her days are numbered If our own offspring is so heartless... ...then why live at all! Why care for a world like this! Jagsir! You toiled your whole life for these demons You have left me in the lurch They have raked up your ashes You great one! If you were wise, you would have done something for us Oh gosh! | am lost from both the worlds. Oh God! You'll ever be cursed, Dharm Singh! What did you get by breaking his marhi? Mother! Get up, go lie down inside! Don't lose heart! Get up! Mother.. Greetings, brother! Sit here. Jagsir! | treated her like my own mother Take this for the obituary ceremony No brother! Keep it. It will be of use to you. The basis of all relations is love My own people have become strangers You are distressed that you have no one in this world You have no descendents In spite of all I have, | feel deprived of everything No, brother. Don't say that. For God's sake, don't say such things. Did you get any clue? | went to aunt at Bhatinda, and visited Bhoonder Didn't get any clue Didn't you ask the dealer? Yes. He has not gone there after the felling of the tree Forget it! We can do without him You handled the work well earlier Work I'll handle, but what about the people! They'll say, | have turned my father out You take charge of the work, I'll handle the people No clue has been found of Dharm Singh Don't lose heart like this! | am there buddy! | am there. Ronki.. Enough. Ronki! I am not worried about myself | am worried about brother Dharm Singh Where shall he jostle around at this age! Enough. O God! You are so unjust Enough. He gave us sorrows. He did not spare people like Dharm Singh too. How are you, dear ones! No one has given you enough fodder You don't speak. How have you become so weak? Listen.. You are no more required People are fond of work alone They don't care for you. Love and affection.. ...Dharm Singh has taken along with him You did what you wanted to. Do you want to take them away too! You have come to show your love! He has not returned home for four months... ...and now you've come to rejoice over our sufferings Get lost from here. Otherwise I won't spare you. What happened? Come, come. This pain is killing. If you don't want to eat then what? The body needs food. You cannot leave it. Now what will I do by living? Now what will I do? | don't have anyone besides you. Ro.. Ronki! Did you meet Bhani? Yes! I met her. At a wedding. Good for her. Now I won't go to meet her. Give her my message Tell her... ...to mop my marhi You'll make it, I am sure Stop this hey! Stop this! Lie down. Don't die. Don't die, my friend. Oh man! You have ten spans of life... You have lived only one. Where have the other nine gone? Wise men have divided Man's life into ten parts Each part consists of ten years. Making in all hundred After every decade Man's life changes Oh man! You have ten spans of life... You have lived only on.. ...where have the other nine gone? Yes, Jagsir yes! Brother.. They say there was life before... ...and there is a life after. One has to account for one's previous life. I have not tingled God's tail Rascal, wise men say this They say.. After being reborn.. ...eighty-four lakh times... ...the soul gets into a man's body How is this accounted for? Tell me? Tell me.. Mother.. | ask.. ...if after the cycle... ...of birth and rebirth eighty-four Lakh times... God.. | say.. ...one doesn't want to be born as man... Do they force you... ...into a man's body? There is no justice then We would... ...like to be born as spiders, lizards How does it bother them anyway! Dogs! Enough. That bull with big horns... ...with a huge mace... ...trampling the fields... - Jagsir. ...the elephant... Jagsir. ...dragging the tree... You lie down. You lie down. I will bring Nandlal. It is one month since he stopped eating He is completely broken from within Intoxicants have added to the damage I had examined him carefully Now you have come. Take these packets Jagsir. Oh, Jagsir. You can't go like this. You can't do what you wish. Don't I have any rights? What have you done? What have you done? My friend! Jagsir, my friend. You have left this world... ...and we are completely ruined Wise men have said, the house of love. Is never lonely. Flowers are put there. Flowers are put there. Lamps of memories flourish there. Lamps of memories flourish there.
