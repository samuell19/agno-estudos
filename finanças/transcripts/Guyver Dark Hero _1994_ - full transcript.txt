THE GUYVER UNIT. IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE THE ALIEN ARMOR INVADED MY BODY AND BECAME A PART OF ME, A YEAR SINCE I FIRST BECAME THE GUYVER AND DESTROYED THE KRONOS CORPORATION AND THEIR SHAPE-CHANGING KILLERS, THE ZOANOIDS. NOW KRONOS IS GONE, BUT THE GUYVER STAYS IN ME, CALLING ME TO FIGHT... TO KILL. DAMN! HURRY UP. FIND THAT SHIT. BINGO! HEY, D.C. DOLLS? THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY. YOU MIX COCAINE WITH PLASTIC, YOU CAN SHAPE IT INTO ANYTHING YOU LIKE. MELT IT BACK DOWN, IT'S 100% PURE. [BANG] WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? BENNY, CHECK IT OUT. YOU GOT IT. STARTING TO REGRET THAT CAREER CHOICE NOW? THERE'S NOBODY UP HERE. ALL RIGHT, GIRLS. COME ON, LET'S HUSTLE. LET'S GO! LET'S GO. MOVE IT! BENNY, WE'RE ROLLING. [BANGING] HEY, BENNY.

[SIZZLING] HEY, MORAN. OVER HERE. SHIT. YEAH, IT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT. [BREATHING HEAVILY] AAH! INSIDE EXPOSE IN THREE PINES, UTAH, TO INVESTIGATE WHAT MAY BE A WEREWOLF ATTACK. DOUG KERLEW AND HIS BROTHER JUDD WERE EXPLORING SOME CAVES ABOVE THESE WOODS, WHEN JUDD WAS ATTACKED AND FATALLY MAULED. RANGERS HERE ARE CALLING IT A BEAR ATTACK, BUT DOUG HAS A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION. YEAH. I MEAN, IT CHANGED. YEAH. RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. IT--IT WAS A MAN... AND THEN IT WAS A THING WITH TEETH AND CLAWS... LIKE ONE OF THOSE CAVE PAINTINGS I SHOWED YOU COME TO LIFE. NO, I WASN'T DRUNK. YOU PEOPLE CALLING ME A LIAR? MY BROTHER'S DEAD, MAN. THAT AIN'T NO LIE. WHEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE HIS ATTACKER, DOUG GAVE US THIS DRAWING, WHICH HE SAYS IS A COPY OF THE PAINTING FOUND ON THE CAVE WALL. THIS, HE CLAIMS, IS WHAT KILLED JUDD KERLEW. I.E. WENT LOOKING FOR THIS CAVE TO VERIFY DOUG'S STORY, AND WE FOUND IT. BUT AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPEDITION INVESTIGATING THE CAVE WAS SUSPICIOUSLY UNCOOPERATIVE WHEN WE ASKED TO SHOOT INSIDE. NEXT UP, MORE ELVIS SIGHTINGS. WHICH HE SAYS IS A COPY OF THE PAINTING FOUND ON THE CAVE WALL. HI, MIZKY. LOOK, I-- I'M READY TO TRY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. I SAW THE PAPERS THIS MORNING. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING'S BETTER. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THE SECURITY GUARD DIED, SEAN. AND THOSE GANGSTERS? HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE TO KILL BEFORE YOU REALIZE-- I DON'T KILL. IT KILLS. SEAN, LISTEN TO YOURSELF. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP THIS. IT WON'T LET ME. THAT'S CRAZY. I KNOW. AND I WANT TO END IT. WILL YOU LISTEN? THERE WAS A THING ON TV THIS MORNING ABOUT A WEREWOLF SIGHTING IN UTAH. WEREWOLVES. ZOANOIDS. IF YOU SAW LISKER OR BALCUS FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHAT WOULD YOU THINK? GOD, STOP IT! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE. THERE ARE NO MORE ZOANOIDS. KRONOS IS GONE. CAN'T YOU LET IT GO? WHAT'S THE POINT OF HOLDING ON? YOU GO OVER IT AND OVER IT AND YOU GET CRAZIER AND CRAZIER. WHEN DO YOU JUST SAY THAT-- THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK, IS IT? HEY, THANKS. [DING] EXCUSE ME. UH...THERE'S AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG GOING ON NEAR HERE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE? CUSTOMER'S WAITIN'. YOU GOING TO BUY SOMETHING? UH, YEAH. WELL? $1.95. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH THEM?

IT WAS LIKE I WAS DIGGING UP PARTS OF MYSELF. YOU'RE NOT SOME KIND OF ARCHAEOLOGY GROUPIE, ARE YOU, SEAN? IT'S JUST THAT I... CAN'T FIGURE YOU OUT. I MEAN, WHY IS COMING HERE SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

BUT I NEED TO STAY. WHY? BECAUSE I CAN'T BE ANYWHERE ELSE. I'VE GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. I'M SORRY. THAT'S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO NEED TO KNOW. I WONDER. DAMN IT. WAIT! IT WAS AROUND HERE THAT WE SAW HIM SOMEWHERE. YOU THINK MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS WHEN THERE'S A LITTLE MORE LIGHT? YOU WANT THIS WEREWOLF OR NOT? LOOK, YOU GOT ABOUT ANOTHER HALF HOUR, MR. KERLEW. AFTER THAT, I'M CALLING IT QUITS. [COCKING RIFLE] JUST HANG ON TO YOUR CHECKBOOK. JESUS CHRIST. YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE? MY DAD AND I ARE KNOWN AMONG THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AS OUTLAWS OF SCIENCE. WE WERE THINKING ABOUT GETTING JACKETS MADE UP. OUTLAWS. WHY? OH, BECAUSE OF OUR UNCONVENTIONAL THEORIES. WE TAKE ON THE WILD STUFF. YOU KNOW, THE STUFF THAT PEOPLE LAUGH AT IN THE TABLOIDS-- BIGFOOT, CROP CIRCLES. AND THE CAVE PAINTINGS? YOU, UH, HAVE A THEORY ON THEM? YOU KNOW, I WANT TO TELL YOU... BUT I CAN'T. TOUCHÃ¡. AAH! WHAT WAS THAT? I HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING. IT COULD BE ANOTHER BEAR ATTACK. YOU GET HELP. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE BEAR. RIGHT. HE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE BEAR? OH, SHIT!

IT CAN'T BE. GUYVER? GET AWAY FROM HIM, ZOANOID! WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? I DESTROYED ALL OF YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE CAMP? DAMN! HUH? OVER HERE. THIS WAY. WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE'S THE BEAR? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THE SOUND OF YOUR ENGINE DROVE IT OFF. OH! NOT SOON ENOUGH. [GROANING] LOOK, THAT ONE'S ALIVE. OH! OH, MAN! STAY AWAY FROM ME. DON'T TOUCH ME. YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. LOOK AT HIM. HE'S SCARED CRAZY. TAKE IT EASY. WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HE'S IN SHOCK. GET ME A BLANKET. YEAH, RIGHT. MAKE THAT TWO. I'M JUST SORRY I DIDN'T GET HERE SOONER. THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO DO? I WAS WONDERING THAT MYSELF. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET HIM IN THE TRUCK. YOU TWO, WRAP THAT ONE UP AND PUT HIM IN BACK. I'LL KEEP US COVERED. O.K. LET'S MOVE OUT. WHO ARE YOU? HE WAS ON THE SCENE BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE. BARKER. SEAN BARKER. NOT AT THIS TIME, BUT ANALYSIS OF THE SAMPLE SHOULD-- [SNAP] I HAVE TO GO. WHAT DID YOU HEAR? WHAT? NOTHING. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. WHY'D YOU FOLLOW ME? I--I-- LET ME GUESS. JUST CURIOUS, RIGHT? I SAW YOU LEAVE CAMP IN A HURRY. I JUST FIGURED YOU'D SEEN THE BEAR AGAIN. WE BOTH KNOW THERE WASN'T ANY BEAR. WE DO? SPARE ME THE DUMB ACT. I KNOW YOU GOT CLAWS YOU AIN'T SHOWING. CLAWS? I'M NOT THE ONE WITH THE CLAWS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU PEOPLE ARE UP TO, BUT INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GETTING KILLED, AND I CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WAIT. YOU'RE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. AND YOU WON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE ME AWAY. [COCKS TRIGGER] WHAT WERE YOU DOING? SORRY, MR. CRANE. TELL THE OTHERS WE MAY HAVE AN ACTIVE-- WHAT ARE YOU MEN DOING THERE? UH...WE THOUGHT WE SAW THE BEAR AGAIN, MR. CRANE. WELL... FOR GOD SAKES, STAY IN CAMP. WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE CORPSES. YES, SIR. YES, SIR. I GOT TO GO. WAIT! WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WE DON'T NEED THIS KIND OF ATTENTION. IF YOU CAN'T KEEP A TIGHTER REIN ON YOUR LIEUTENANTS... [WHISPERING] I'M SORRY, SIR. I'LL CORRECT MY ERROR. BUT IT DID BRING SOMETHING TO LIGHT. THE GUYVER, HE'S HERE. HE MUST BE SOMEONE IN THE CAMP. HMM. THE HUNTED COMES TO THE HUNTER. FIND OUT WHO HE IS AND BRING HIM HERE-- QUIETLY. DON'T WORRY, SIR. I CAN HANDLE IT. MORNING, BOB. HOW ARE YOU? THIS WASN'T HERE YESTERDAY. HUH. CORI, YOU CAN TELL ME. YOU LIKE HIM? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. I'M JUST EXCITED FOR YOU, THAT'S ALL. IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW SOMEONE'S FINDING A LITTLE ROMANCE. ALL RIGHT. HE'S CUTE. BUT NOTHING IS HAPPENING. HE'S A LITTLE... HI. COFFEE? DID I MISS SOMETHING? UH, NO, SEAN. HAVE A SEAT. THAT'LL BE ALL. CHECK ON YOU IN A BIT. TAKE YOUR TIME. SO...HOW GOES THE QUEST? WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING. WHAT KIND OF SKELETONS ARE WE DIGGING UP AGAIN? WELL, UM, WE'RE NOT SURE, BUT WE THINK IT'S A KIND OF PACHYOCEPHALOSAUR, ALTHOUGH IT'S SMALL FOR THAT GENUS. ONCE WE CARBON-DATE IT, WE'LL KNOW WHERE TO PLACE IT, BUT RIGHT-- WHAT? YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALMOST WORD FOR WORD WHAT BOB SAID. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS HIDING? THEY'RE NOT DINOSAURS AT ALL, ARE THEY? LOOK... EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT WE'RE DIGGING FOR. SO WHY ALL THE SECRECY? WE CAN'T JUST GO SPOUTING CRAZY THEORIES TO THE WORLD UNTIL WE HAVE THE HARD EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP. DAD AND I HAVE BEEN PUTTING THIS PUZZLE TOGETHER FOR FIVE YEARS, JUST PRAYING IT ISN'T ANOTHER EXPLAINABLE MYSTERY. IF WE'RE WRONG AGAIN... SO...WHY NOT JUST STICK TO THE SAFER STUFF? WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME? I AM NOT GOING TO LET ANYBODY TAKE THIS AWAY FROM US. WELL? FEELS LIKE LEATHER. IT'S SOFT. HERE, GIVE ME THAT. [CLINK CLINK] THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE LEATHER TO ME. HEY, DR. EDWARDS. DR. EDWARDS, OVER HERE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, MY DEAR? LISTEN. [CLINK CLINK CLINK] THIS IS WONDERFUL! CALL MY DAUGHTER. INFORM MR. CRANE. GET EVERYONE IN HERE ON THE DOUBLE! I THINK WE'VE FOUND IT. DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON? CORI, I THINK OUR FIVE YEARS OF RESEARCH ARE ABOUT TO PAY OFF. BUT WHEN WILL WE KNOW FOR SURE? PATIENCE, ARLEN. WE BEAT YOUR DEADLINE. JUST GIVE US THE TIME TO DO THIS RIGHT. BUT THERE'S BEEN A COMPLICATION. SOMETHING'S COME UP. ARLEN, PLEASE. GEE, YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE EXPLAINABLE MYSTERIES, DO YOU? JUST SHUT UP AND DIG. DR. EDWARDS! DR. EDWARDS! WE TOOK SOME READINGS AT THE CLIFF. IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. THIS THING IS HUGE. THESE CAVE PAINTINGS ARE ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS, AND I SPECULATE THAT IT SINKS DOWN ANOTHER 40 METERS AND CURVES EAST AND WEST FOR 20 METERS IN EACH DIRECTION. IT'S A SHIP. WHOO HOO! [MUSIC PLAYS] BOB, HAVE YOU SEEN SEAN? NOT LATELY. HEY. YOU O.K.? I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WE CAME HERE HOPING TO FIND... ANYTHING, ANYTHING THAT WOULD SUGGEST AN ANCIENT ALIEN VISITATION. WE WOULD HAVE SETTLED FOR ALIEN BEER CANS. INSTEAD, WE GOT... FIVE YEARS OF GETTING LAUGHED AT, OUR RESEARCH IGNORED BY OUR COLLEAGUES. OOH, THE PAPER I'M GOING TO PUBLISH. BUT THE BEST PART IS THAT NOW I HAVE GOT THE GREATEST PLAYGROUND A GIRL COULD EVER WISH FOR. LOOK AT THIS! IT'S ORGANIC. IT WAS GROWN. THAT SAMPLE I TOOK WAS ALIVE-- ALIVE, SEAN. THIS THING MIGHT HAVE BEEN POWERED BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS. O.K., THAT'S ALL THEORY, BUT WITH FUNDING WE CAN FIND OUT. WE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO DUPLICATE IT. IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO GROW A MACHINE. NO MORE DIRTY FACTORIES. NO MORE POLLUTION. WHAT? NOTHING. NOW I SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU AN OUTLAW. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STEPPED INSIDE, AND ALREADY YOU'RE SAVING THE WORLD. WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M AN OPTIMIST. WISH I COULD SEE THE WORLD LIKE THAT. WE, UM... WE'RE MISSING THE PARTY. I'M NOT MISSING ANYTHING. COME ON. LET'S GO. [HISSING] DO YOU HEAR THAT? HEAR WHAT? NOTHING. YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING REALLY SCARY? HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA! [GROWLING AND MOANING] HEY, CORI! COME HERE. I'LL BE JUST A SECOND. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE KRONOS CORPORATION? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? COME ON. YOU DATED A MIZKY SEGAWA WHOSE FATHER WORKED FOR KRONOS. HE WAS MURDERED SHORTLY BEFORE THE L.A. BRANCH WAS DESTROYED. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? ONLY WHAT I READ IN THE PAPERS. HEY, LESS OF THAT SHIT, ALL RIGHT? LET GO OF ME. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. YOU KNEW ENOUGH TO KNOW THE CLAWS WEREN'T YOURS. WHAT? YOU SAID THE CLAWS WEREN'T YOURS. SO WHOSE ARE THEY? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT KRONOS AND WHAT THEY DO. WHY? YOU SAID KRONOS WAS DESTROYED. KRONOS L.A. KRONOS L.A.? JESUS. WE KNOW KRONOS IS WORLDWIDE. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE. WE FOUND BREEDING TUBES AND BLOOD SAMPLES, BUT NEVER ANY BODIES. ALL RIGHT. LOOK. KRONOS IS THOSE THINGS-- THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION. THEY LOOK HUMAN, BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY CHANGE. YOU'RE SERIOUS, AREN'T YOU? YOU SAW THAT DEAD GUY LAST NIGHT. THE THING THAT KILLED HIM IS ONE OF THE GUYS IN THIS CAMP. YOU SAW THIS? THEN WHY DIDN'T HE KILL YOU? I-- I'LL TELL YOU LATER. NO. YOU TELL ME NOW. DON'T MAKE ME ARREST YOU. HERE? EVERYTHING O.K.? YEAH. IT'S FINE. NICE GUY. KID, YOU GOT TO GET YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT. WELL, I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS. DAMN IT! WE'VE COME THIS FAR. NOW WHAT? WE CAN HAVE A LASER CUTTER UP HERE IN TWO DAYS, THREE DAYS TOPS. THREE DAYS? DON'T WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE CAMP? SURE. GARDEN TOOLS AND WHISK BROOMS. LASERS WEREN'T THE FIRST THING ON THE EQUIPMENT LIST. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY, OPEN SESAME? [SHIP GROANS] AMAZING. IT'S BREATHABLE. THE RADIATION LEVELS ARE ACCEPTABLE. WE CAN CONTINUE. THE REST OF YOU MAY RESUME YOUR WORK. CORI. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. NO ONE IS TO TOUCH ANYTHING OR ENTER ANY SEALED ROOM. WE'RE CATALOGUING ONLY TODAY. TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES AND TRY TO MAP THE INTERIOR AS YOU GO. IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE BREATHING, GET OUT. WE'RE NOT SACRIFICING ANYONE IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE. GOT IT? GOOD. CORI, YOU AND SEAN GO THAT WAY. WE'LL GO THROUGH HERE. LET'S GO. THIS WAY. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. WOW. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S REALLY HUMID IN HERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M HERE. TALK TO ME, PLEASE. WELL? [WHISTLES] MY GOD. HOW THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO GET UP THERE? NO STAIRS. NO VISIBLE ACCESS UP. I HAVE A FEELING THAT WALKING WAS OPTIONAL FOR THESE PEOPLE. WE'LL HAVE TO JERRY-RIG SOMETHING, I SUPPOSE. GET STARTED. I'M SURE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS UP THERE. I'M HERE. WELL, YOU CALLED ME HERE. AREN'T YOU GOING TO SAY SOMETHING? PLEASE. I'M TRYING, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. PLEASE. WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME? WHAT THE HELL AM I? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT? YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY. I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS. I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE. I'M NOT A KILLER. I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL AGAIN. I WANT MY LIFE BACK! DAD. LOOK AT THIS. IT MOVED. CORI, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING. WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND? LET ME SEE THAT. NO! GIVE IT BACK! CORI. WE'RE THE RESEARCHERS. IT'S OUR JOB TO EXAMINE THE NEW ARTIFACTS. AS THE FUNDERS OF THIS EXPEDITION, WE HAVE WHATEVER RIGHTS WE CHOOSE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GO BACK TO STATE AND TEACH FRESHMAN ARCHAEOLOGY, WHILE WE'RE MAKING HISTORY. DAD, WHY DON'T YOU STOP HIM? THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY WE'VE MADE, AND YOU'RE LETTING HIM TAKE IT AWAY. WE'LL GET OUR CHANCE, CORI. ARLEN'S JUST TAKING IT AWAY FOR, UH, SAFEKEEPING. SAFEKEEPING? HE'S STEALING IT. CORI, ARE YOU O.K.? SEAN, HE'S TAKING IT AWAY. THIS IS A BREACH OF CONTRACT, CRANE. WE'LL SUE YOU FOR THIS! WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FREE REIN-- NO INTERFERENCE FROM THE CORPORATION! DO YOU HEAR ME? FORGET IT, CORI. DAD. WE'LL GET OUR CHANCE, CORI. JUST LET IT GO. CORI-- NO! WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ALL? HE TOOK IT AWAY FROM US. MR. CRANE. IT'S ABOUT THE NEW KID. CAN I COME IN? WHAT DO YOU WANT, SEAN? I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CRANE. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM RIGHT NOW. CORI, THERE ARE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT... YOU AND YOUR FATHER HAVE BEEN LIED TO. YOU'RE WORKING FOR A CORPORATION CALLED KRONOS. CRANE IS A PART OF THEM. THEY... THEY'RE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS? I DON'T KNOW ANY KRONOS. OUR BACKERS ARE THE TEMPUS GROUP. NO. THEY'RE KRONOS. TRUST ME. THE THING YOU DISCOVERED IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. IT'S CALLED A GUYVER UNIT. IT'S...IT'S A POWERFUL WEAPON. KRONOS HAS BEEN AFTER IT FOR YEARS. ALL THE PEOPLE... SHIT. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR KRONOS CAN CHANGE INTO MONSTERS CALLED ZOANOIDS. VOLKER IS ONE FOR SURE, PROBABLY MOST OF THE OTHERS. THE MONSTERS IN THE CAVE PAINTINGS AND THE SKELETONS YOU'VE BEEN DIGGING UP, THEY'RE ZOANOIDS. THE BEARS THAT KILLED THOSE PEOPLE ARE ZOANOIDS, TOO. THEY'VE LIVED ALONGSIDE US FOREVER. ALL THE STORIES YOU'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT WEREWOLVES OR BIGFOOT, UH, THEY'RE ALL-- CORI, I KNOW, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. LISTEN-- NO, YOU LISTEN. I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE. THEY PUT UP THE MONEY FOR THIS DIG. IF THEY PULL OUT, THE SHIP IS GONE. OH, SHIT. WE'VE ONLY JUST STEPPED INSIDE. IS THE SHIP MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR LIFE? YOU'RE DEALING WITH MONSTERS HERE. I TRUSTED YOU, SEAN. I TRUSTED YOU NOT TO BE CRAZY. DAMN IT. CRANE-- [CRANE] THE SHIP WE EXCAVATED IS A GOLD MINE, MR. GOUO. NOW'S THE TIME TO TERMINATE ALL NONKRONOS PERSONNEL AND BRING IN OUR OWN. TERMINATE? WHAT ABOUT EDWARD'S DAUGHTER AND THE GUYVER? [CRANE] DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER. SHE'S HANDLED. AND THE GUYVER'S IN OUR HANDS. HE'LL BE ON THE WAY TO YOU IN AN HOUR.

EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL. I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT. BESIDES, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO WINS. I DOUBT THE GOVERNMENT IS MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN KRONOS. NO. WE CAN'T. ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE. I'LL NEVER GET A CHANCE-- NEITHER WILL I. BUT IF WE DON'T DESTROY IT, TOO MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE FIGHTING FOR IT. THEY WANT THE WEAPONS, CORI. IT'S ALL THEY'LL EVER WANT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONLY GOING TO PISS HIM OFF. GRRR! NOW THAT WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME. [BEEPER BEEPS] I HAVE TO TAKE THIS. YOUR HOUR IS UP. WHERE IS THE GUYVER? THERE'S BEEN SOME DELAYS.

I WAS SCARED THAT I WAS CHASING SOME PIPE DREAM. AND THE MINUTE I FIND OUT IT'S TRUE... I HAVE TO DESTROY IT. WHAT'S WRONG? DON'T FIGHT IT. GO. KEEP SETTING THE CHARGES. WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME? AM I NOT THE ONE YOU WANT? I'M NOT THE ONE, AM I? GUYVER. AAH! AAH! AAH! THE GUYVER WILL BE BACK SOON. LET'S PREPARE HIM A NICE WELCOME. WHAT ABOUT HIM? BRING HIM. LETS SHOW HIM SOME REAL SOLDIERS IN ACTION. COME ON, SEAN. WHERE ARE YOU? TAKE HER! AAH! ARRGH! [CORI] GUYVER! UHH! AN ARCHAEOLOGIST DESTROYING THE PAST. NOT ACCEPTED SCIENTIFIC BEHAVIOR, MISS EDWARDS. IT'S BETTER THAN HANDING IT OVER TO YOU! THE GUYVER MUST BE IN THE SHIP. FIND HIM! UHH! LET HER GO, CRANE! IMPRESSIVE... BUT POINTLESS. ARE YOU O.K., CORI? YEAH. SEAN... DON'T BE A HERO. DEACTIVATE THE GUYVER AND SURRENDER... OR I'LL KILL HER. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, SEAN! AH! TIME'S A-WASTIN'. CRANE... STOP! CRANE... WE HAD A DEAL. DAD, HELP! ARLEN... PLEASE. WE HAD A DEAL. YES. WE PAY FOR YOUR RESEARCH, AND YOU GIVE US THE WEAPONS. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOUR DAUGHTER, MARCUS. IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US A LOT OF TROUBLE. HOW CAN YOU BARGAIN WITH THIS MURDERER? DON'T YOU GET IT, CORI? YOUR DAD'S A COMPANY MAN. STAND ASIDE, MARCUS. NOW, ONE LAST TIME! RETRACT THE ARMOR... OR I'LL TEAR HER APART. HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA! NO! YOU WILL NOT HURT MY DAUGHTER! HA HA HA HA! MARCUS... YOU'RE FIRED. ATKINS, CATCH. PROTECT HER. WHO THE HELL'S GOING TO PROTECT ME? ME! HA HA HA HA HA! GIVE ME YOUR CASE. THE CASE. YEAH, BUT-- JUST GIVE IT TO ME! O.K., BITCH, COME GET IT. HYAH! YOUR ASS IS MINE! [WILD CACKLING] DAD! UNH! GRRR! BITCH. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, MARCUS. WE WERE DOING GREAT THINGS TOGETHER. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY IN THE COMPANY. JUNIOR VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF GENOCIDE? I'D RATHER DIE. AAH! HA HA HA! THEN SO BE IT! NO! LEAVE HIM ALONE. BACK OFF! HOW'S HE DOING? I DON'T KNOW... IT'S BAD. WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING YOUR OWN KIND, FREAK? WE COULD HAVE HELPED YOU. I'M NO FREAK, AND I'M NOT LIKE YOU. YOU THREATEN MANKIND. I PROTECT THEM. BARKER! HA HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA HA! YOU DIDN'T. SO TELL ME, WHO'S GOING TO PROTECT THE PROTECTOR? BIOMORPH! OH, MY GOD! A GUYVER ZOANOID. HA HA. THE NEXT STEP! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THAT UNIT'S DAMAGED. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'LL DO TO YOU. BUT IT'LL DO YOU JUST FINE. YOU CAN'T WIN, CRANE. THE SHIP TOLD ME THE TRUTH. YOU'RE AN EXPERIMENT GONE OUT OF CONTROL. NO. I'M IN COMPLETE CONTROL. THE ALIENS CREATED THE GUYVER TO FIX THEIR MISTAKES. YOU'RE THE MISTAKE! I'M THE FINAL PRODUCT. WITH THIS ALIEN POWER, KRONOS WILL BE TRIUMPHANT, AND MAN SHALL KNOW HIS TRUE DESTINY... TO SERVE OUR KIND. YOU'RE CRACKED, CRANE. YOU'RE GOING TO SELF-DESTRUCT. NEVER! THE UNIT FEEDS ME. I FEEL THE POWER GROWING STRONGER. HYAH! HA HA HA. HA HA HA HA HA. HA HA HA HA! HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE OBSOLETE, OUTCLASSED BY A NEW MODEL? CRANE! AAH! SORRY, CRANE... THIS MODEL HAS BEEN RECALLED! [MOANING] [SIGHS] OUT OF CONTROL. SEAN! SEAN, WE DID IT. WE DID IT. SO... LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND YOUR DESTINY. CORI, I LIED. THE ZOANOIDS WEREN'T THE FAILED EXPERIMENT. THE GUYVERS WERE. THE ALIENS TURNED HUMANS INTO GUYVERS SO WE COULD FIGHT THEIR WARS FOR THEM. THE HUMANS REBELLED. OUT OF CONTROL. THE GUYVER IS NOTHING MORE THAN A WEAPON. I HAVE NO DESTINY. YOU MADE YOUR OWN. YOU'RE A HELL OF A WEAPON, KID. IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'RE ON OUR SIDE. I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN, BUT YOU MAY HAVE JUST PREVENTED ARMAGEDDON. WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE WEAPONS ARE ON BOARD. NOW AT LEAST THEY'LL BE SAFE WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHERE THEY BELONG. NO... THAT'S NOT WHERE IT BELONGS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SEAN? STAND BACK, CORI. [ATKINS] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M SENDING IT HOME. WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT! THAT'S GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. STOP IT! YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. NO, I'M SAVING IT. IT'S NOT SAFE. LET'S GO. BARKER? THIS IS NOT THE TIME. WE HAVE TO TALK. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO SAY. WAIT. WE'RE LAUNCHING AN UNDERGROUND WAR AGAINST KRONOS. THE GOVERNMENT COULD USE YOUR HELP. SEE YOU AROUND, ATKINS. AT LEAST TELL ME HOW I COULD REACH YOU!
