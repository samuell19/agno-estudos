[STUDENTS RECITING TAMIZH RHYMES] [Students] Hey, the lorry has arrived. Come on, keep reversing there, stop right there! Come on, put that bench out here. Ey-- climb up in twos climb up carefully Ey-- hope everyone is carrying your casual clothes? Ah-- students in uniform change into casuals. -Be careful, kid -Brother, how's AHM doing? He's doing good, when is the next gathering? Very soon, it'll be great if the head count increases. Firstly, you hike the price 50 per head. It's their parents demand. Ah-- fine will pay up soon. AHM asked to mention it. You guys are charging 200/head-- --why don't you use that? -Then, what about us? As if you're going to pay up. One, two, three, four, five... ...six, nine, ten -Hello, hello... Where are you taking the students during the school hours? -He's the new Teacher -Oh is it? Can't you hear what I am saying? Let them go. Ey-- how dare you? -Hurry up lazy heads, load them up sooner. -Oh God, what happened? -That's our Maths Teacher -Come on, climb up -Look, there's space... -Load them up -You're forgetting this is a school Get lost, damn it Come on climb up. Load them all carefully... Hey, bolt the door. That's fine, you've been asking too many questions though are you new to this town? Are you going to get an admission at that school? Obviously they'll be shocked to hear it's not a school, but a buzzing market. Garbage lying all over commotion, will be like a herd of goats. You will see students gathered in groups fighting in the name of caste. Teachers are hopeless, with no sense of time or discipline. Govt. Schools, are bound to be worse but this school, tops the list in being the worst. Schools are meant to teach good things but if you study at this school you'll end up attaining all sorts of bad habits. The town is called "Puthur" but the teachers are still stuck in Stone Age. Look-- the safe haven you were looking for is here. [Vendor] Sour berries for 1 buck, and candies for 50 cents. In spite of warning, you're getting an admission here carry on It's better to give an advice or experience, only if asked. Add this cigarette on my tab. As if the students are smart enough to grasp, if taught.‏ She's gone a little overboard with the lipstick today. Ey-- play without making a noise. Ey-- let that go buddy. Prominent ruler and War Commander Karren Wallis Prabhu following Warren Hastings Prabhu, took an oath as Chief Commander of India. Fine, shall we remember the name? "Reigner" "Foreigner... Wallis" Keep water mug as a reference. They had arrived to loot everything from our country. Yes, Teacher [In Unison] Very Good. Now tell me what is the name? Karren Wallis Prabhu! Ok, next we'll try to remember the year. How's your business coming along? The business is running good. I Just came to sign the register. -There's no one at the shop, I'll leave. -Fine, you leave [SINGING A TAMIL HIT SONG] Excuse me! Don't you conduct morning prayers? What do you guys want? I'm here for admission wait for a while, once AHM is here, meet him and get a receipt. Only then, I'll issue an application. Seems like there's no Head Master out here. There's no Head Master over here don't be annoying, wait over there. If AHM arrives, he'll yell at me. -Come on... -Mmmm I can't even do a Rangoli in the morning. Excuse me! Welcome, Sir. Gotta pay electricity bill for both the houses -don't forget -I'll go right away, Sir. Meena! -Bloody womanizer -Give me a smile... Don't you have any sense? you're blocking the way move aside. Right in the morning. -Good Morning, Sir. -Mmmm-hmmm Listen, this is AHM. Come in and speak to him. -What do you want? -Admission for this kid. It's been a month, since the school began and you're here now? -Which grade? -6th grade. Why do I have to pay 2500 rupees? Isn't the Govt. fees 230 rupees? If you seek Private Schools, you'll end up spending a bomb. Moreover they'll demand more for being a month late. If you're willing, then pay what's mentioned on that if not get out from here. You're not even 1% fit to be here wonder how you became a Teacher. Ey-- Ey, how dare you? Don't mess around with me. You're getting angry, 'cause I insulted you just the same, we're angry when you speak. Oh-- so you too will get angry? If you're angry, take your kid to another school. This kid won't get an admission, even if anyone recommends her. Take your kid and get out from here. You're going overboard, damn it. Ey-- Ey! Vasugi! -Stop that woman -What is she doing? -Stop that woman. -Ma'am stop, don't do it. -Stop right there, damn woman. -Please listen, stop it Don't you have any sense? -Give me that rod... -What you've been doing? She's so bloody stubborn. Can't you hear? Have you gone mad? What are you reading? Put that paper down and stop her. She's the Head Master! AHM got rattled, 'cause she rang the bell. They'll ask us to disperse once the prayers are done. I am Geetha Rani! From this moment, I'm the Head Master of this school. Everyone should be inside the school before 9am. At 9:05am the school gate will be locked. No one should jump over the walls. No one should step inside the school without the uniform. Oh God no! In spite of hearing the bell ring 12 teachers who didn't enter the class, issue an memo to them, Vasugi. Ok, madam. If anyone gets 3 memos, generate suspension 6 teachers, who have signed the ledger but not inside the school file a Police complaint against them. I'll recommend suspension. -Once in, hand it over to them -Seems like, we gotta work -PET...! -Huh? School should remain as a school and teachers should be there for students. Prayer, disperse! Madam! Shall I assemble all the teachers for introduction? -How long will it take? -It will take an hour, madam Meanwhile, who will be teaching at the class? I'll get to know the names and details, when required -ask them to head to their classes -Mmmm Ok, Madam. -Vasugi! -Madam... Why isn't he at a class? Madam, we didn't prepare a schedule for him. Prepare a schedule and hand it over by the end of the day. Now ask him to substitute for a class. He can come over, when I'm not around. Ok, madam! Good Morning, Madam. Why is this here? So that no one gets in without your permission. To discriminate ones' entry-- --it's not the crux of a Temple. -Remove it! -Ok, madam. The room is in a great mess. I'm doomed! I'll clean it up, I will get men and get it cleaned. I've made her admission, please sign here. -Make sure she comes to the school -Ok, madam. Study well. Go ahead! Sorry Madam, I wasn't aware you were the Head Master. Heavy rainfall in Andhra, from Cuddapah district. But our town is parched with no rain. Ey-- AHM is here. Sir, please come in. He must be tired after the class. He comes to the staff room, once in 6 months. Move aside, let him sit down. Sir, please sit down. I've cleaned the bench for you. Don't be scared, it won't break. Sit down, he won't ask you to. Ey! Wonder where she came from... ...just a day, and it feels like we faced a hailstorm. I was having a candy. -Do you want? -Ey... -What 'bout you? -Don't piss me off Even if you're, I don't care. Bloody dufus! He's nodding like a Penguin. -Look, isn't this good? -It won't work out -Get inside -HM, is here... -Get lost... -Buddy hide your cigarette It's the HM, get inside boys. I'm studying at a Govt. School, 'cause it's not strict -do you know, who is my father? -Hey! He has to bring his father to school tomorrow. -Ok, Madam. -Got the cigarette, scoot from here. Welcome, Miss. New Head Master. You should sell, cigarettes, betel etc 500m off the school I shouldn't see sell them anymore. You can put a leash on your students don't teach us how to run a business. Ey-- Ey! Ey-- Ey! Look here, you're messing with the wrong person Hey! Hey, come on keep running madam, I won't sell anymore Hey! Hey! What is it? The new teacher held the shopkeeper's hand twisted it then she gave a strong blow with another hand. Then she whisked a strong kick--- ---he fell far from here. -Did you see it? -Yes, I did see. -She's poisonous... -She was there too Can I join you guys? -Good afternoon, teacher -Please come in, ma'am Good afternoon, teacher Hey, move aside. Please sit down. Please share among yourselves. What 'bout me then? Here, please take these. -Ey, share some -You too share... Who brought Dry fish curry? It was from me, teacher. Tell your mom, it is delicious. Ok, teacher. We didn't get introduced. I'm Seetha I'm Deepika I'm Farahana I'm Ashika and I am Chitra, teacher. -I am Geetha Rani -Ok, teacher. Just call me, Geetha. that's how you call a friend, right? but make sure, don't get too comfortable with it. -Ok, Geetha. -Please eat. Ey-- HM is here. Ey-- come on run. run away, you're going to get beatings from her Hey, be careful! Why do you have run so fast? Eh-- can't you be careful? Why were you running from me? Do I look like a witch to you? You were here to drink water, right? You should fear, only if you've done something wrong. -Ok? -Mmmm! Which grade are you in? 2nd Grade! -What's your name? -Kathir. -Kathir, is it? -Mmmm. Go! Only the day and date is being changed Newspaper looks like is being xeroxed everyday. You asked for coffee and disappeared. I went to the neighbors to get cable and newspaper contact. Fine, how was the school? It's good though. But I heard something else I was told the town is a hot bed for crime at least one murder gets registered in a month. This town keeps the Police quite busy. If Teachers put in extra effort the burden on Police will come down. Fine, you've started your job no one can stop you, continue. -Coffee is on the table. -Will have it dear... [PRAYER & RIGHTEOUSNESS] [OUR SCHOOL] Did you get your kid admitted into the school? Why are you headed once again to the school? I've started a new job over there. Really? That too at that atrocious school? What job is it? Oh, you must've joined the Treasury Thank goodness, I thought you joined the herd of donkeys. One main reason, this nation is backward, is 'cause of the teachers. They never nurtured a generation stating, bribery and scams are wrong. Do you think Teachers take up the job to serve? If the Govt. announces, their salary will be reduced to half half the Teachers training colleges in Tamilnadu will be shut down. Failing to do their job, in spite of getting paid is a scam too. What do you say? Madam, daily I'll do your pick up and drop I'm a scam-free auto driver. Don't look for another auto. -Here, take this... -thank you, madam. Good Morning, Good Morning. Vanakkam! Please sit down. -Vanakkam, Madam. -Mmmm. You're Susheela Teacher, right? That's right, do you know me? I've heard a lot about you. When told you'll be promoted only if transferred you refused to do so and have continued to work in this school for 33 years. Please bless me. Ah-- it's fine dear. Bless you! Good Morning to all. I'll tell you the new format for prayers. Once the bell rings, everyone should assemble on this ground in 5 minutes. They'll play you a song. All of you can dance to that song. In fact, even the teachers can dance to it. This will be called, Warm up song! Play! [WARM UP SONG PLAYS] ♪ Go! Go! Go! ♪ ♪ A new era has begun, wake up folks ♪ ♪ Go! Go!

Vanakkam, Sir. Boss, our new school at Velumpatti he's the Teacher at the Govt. school over there. He got 12 bright students to join our school he's here to collect his commission for that. Good job! If he gets 20 or more students, give him 10-15% commission. Ok, Boss! -Wait here. -Sure! Good morning, Sir. -Good Morning! -Sir, a minute please -What's it? -Quarry details are here -Good Morning, Sir. Boss, quarry order file is here. Listen-- a new voice was heard at the school in town. I did hear-- inquire about it. Ok, Boss! -Ey! -Boss... don't send anyone, you personally inquire about it. Ok, boss. Who was it? Look, that lady over there. An outsider with such arrogance. Stop right there, are you the new Head Master? I heard that you won't let my son inside the school, if I don't meet you Our party will reign next I'm the MLA of this constituency. That's the only reason, my son is studying in this Govt. School. He's living his life with full freedom I don't bother him at all. Who are you to question him? Freedom is something, you shouldn't take it for granted. You should do the right thing. What!? I didn't understand? Then he's not incapable You're incapable of being a father. I'll take care of him. You can get out from here. Ey-- you don't know who you're messing with? This is my town. This is my, School! I'll get you sacked from this school. Ey-- you don't have to study at this school anymore. Zero! I meant you. What are you staring at? That's right, you're a Zero! Have you achieved anything other than your father's wealth? Have you topped the class? or have you won a prize in some sport? You're a hero, only if you achieve more than your father offers. If not, a Zero! Win, if you got the courage. I'll present my cheeks to you you can give me a slap. If you think you'll lose get out from here, right away. Ey!...Ey! A woman in this town has become popular in just a day what did you say? That school has got a new woman Head Master -Oh-Oh! -She's arrogant it seems. She dictates her own rules. MLA from the opposition party of this town his son studies at that school. He went on to speak for his son-- --and got insulted by the Head Master. That woman Head Master, is new to her job-- --just wait and watch, she'll succumb to scams too. Highly Possible! [PARENTS] Just 'cause a new HM has arrived they'll call for a meeting and yell at the kids. On top of it, an useless gathering. Ey-- look at her blouse looks like a Police women. -Good Morning, Madam. Everyone is here -Ok. For God sake, please be seated calm. We can only go in the evening-- --this women, called everyone for a gathering. There's no one to help at the shop, gotta find someone Greetings to one and all. -I'm the new new Head Master. -Yesu said will take care of it Why don't come too, we'll catch a movie. Come on, let's catch a movie. Ey-- Ey, hang up, I'll call you back soon. I'm sure many will have a personal attachment with this school. You might have studied over here. Can someone, tell me if there's a difference-- --from the time you were a student out here? Nothing has changed, madam. Everything is the same. Who do you hold responsible for this? Neither MLA nor an MP has done any good till now. What else? Officers working here don't report the mishaps to the higher officials. What else? Neither the system nor the Govt. is doing anything about it. What have you done? What have you done for the school you studied in? Temples in every town are vibrant and colorful. Govt. didn't come forward with funds to develop them. It's the public, who did it. Temples and schools are not the same. In fact, a step above. God comes after the Teacher. People are generous with donations during the Temple festivities. Why don't you feel the same, when it comes to the schools. If you people come forward, not only the crux of temples, even the school toilets will be spick and span. It should come from your heart. Many wage workers children study at this school I'm asking them too even if you have to carry a huge sign for help either at your work place or someone for that matter you guys point me towards them, I'll ask them myself. But that has to benefit our children. Hello, tell me. I'm Head Master speaking form R Puthur. Tell me, madam. Accounts state, since 4 years you've used fund for the welfare of the school. But nothing has been done. Your people should arrive tomorrow over here and the work should begin. If not, the entire school will be at the PWD office.

You put up a big banner in multicolor right in front of that school. Whenever they go past that school-- --they should be reminded of our school. Our people, when they look at the advertisement will take up loan and admit their children for the sake of pride. She can't do squat about it. Ok, boss. [TEACHERS] Students, listen here am, is, are was, were shall be, will be these are the 12 forms this is the formula to speak in English. -Sir! -Madam... Can I ask you 3 questions? Ya sure, please go ahead Is this the easy formula to speak in English? That's right, madam. Grammar it is. Why don't you talk in English? I can read and write, madam but to speak in English, small problem, madam. If you spend an hour for 40 days private schools state, you can easily learn English. But over here in spite of learning it for 12 years, 99% can't speak in English. English draws in only fear. It's 'cause, the English teachers can't speak in English. You have 30 days-- --if you don't speak in English, then I'll have to asking to check your quality I have rights to do that. If you're not aware, then read the rule book. Can I ask you 3 questions? Sure, madam. Where all Maths is applied? Addition, subtraction, division and to multiply -it's used for all of it -what else? What else...? There's no computer without Maths you can't launch a rocket without Maths. Time and period, everything rely on Maths. There's no science without maths. First, you gotta learn then you can teach them. One month Teachers who don't update themselves-- --can't create advanced students. You can't perform an experiment given in the book how can you create scientists out of them? History is read-- --not to just create history teach them not to repeat the mistakes in the history. Do, have, had... I have not slept well, last night. Who the hell invented, English? It's surprising though didn't you say, only private school teachers take notes You just make rice cakes, I'm already out of steam. Mmmm-hmmm, seems like you've started working. Mom, at your school even teachers are given homework shut up and mind your business. She sounds exactly like her. [HEAVY SNORING] [STARTLED] It wasn't me, Teacher -Keep studying, Dad. -Get out! I'm going. Is it O2H for water? or is it H2O? I read that in school, can't remember. H2O...O2H H2O... Look like he's got piles, been walking for a while How come you're not eating? Not hungry? Stop right there, do you have constipation? That madam, is going out of control. She's been torturing everyone. That's why you should be a PT master. She won't come towards the ground. Next you're doomed. My curse will come true. H2O... [STUDENTS CLAMOR ON THE GROUND] -Good Morning, Geetha -Good Morning! Hey kids, come over here, quick. Put aside the bat and balls over there. Everyone stand in a line. Ey-- please, one, two One, two My chickpeas...four oh no, it's falling down five, six Sorry chickpeas...chickpeas, seven, eight Good Morning, madam. Can I help you with something? I'm on duty. Usually, I don't speak to anyone on duty. -Oh...Oh! -Duty first! One, two, three, four -Five -Can I ask you 3 questions? Damn that baldy's curse is coming true Two periods per week in a year approximately 60 classes Is this what you gonna teach them? Individual games did Sir, examine everyone based on team sports? NO! Ssssh...be quiet. Then why do we need a PET master for the school? You conduct competitions for the sake of it. A kid on the run inside a jungle can defeat an animal. You can find a runner in him. Farmer’s children has got the best of stamina. Martial arts, ploughing, there are a many forms You should find out, what they're capable of. Ok, Teacher. Only if you discover talents from rural children we can win Internationally. That's true, teacher. I asked you to do it. Then one more question-- --how many games are played in Olympics? Madam, I'll learn everything in a month. I'll somehow manage to make her, PT Usha. I'll definitely do something with him. But I'll listen to everything you ask me to do. Please don't give me a memo. -'Cause I have loans to pay -It's not really up to me It lies in your performance. Performance uh? What is that? I'm not sure what you're going to do you got to transfer that lady from that school. It's not even two months, since she joined how can I transfer her so soon? Fine, our district Minister, isn't he your close friend? why don't you ask him? Don't just rant for the sake of it. He's ruling party and I'm opposition. Come on, he's been waiting for you to come. Do you expect me to go and meet him? I can't bow down to him suggest another way to it. If that's the case-- --not only transfer, you can even suspend her as if you're not aware of it. Stir up a conflict. She never smiles at me-- --how come she's smiling today? -He's here... -Vanakkam, Sir. Sit down. I'm wondering, how she became an Head Mistress at such an young age. When I inquired at CEO office, I was told, direct posting. I think he's not aware. I'm sure, something is fishy. I'm going to drag her to the court. -Sir.. -What is it? Don't believe me? I'm going to make her beg. You've been suspended. What!? That's right, Sir. Damn it, do you peck yourself for a Queen? Do you peck yourself for a Queen? You don't make the rules here. You've suspended me, without a memo. Only CEO has the power to suspend. But you must've recommended. I might have May be one of the students who were swore at in the name of caste or for harassing the teachers and female students may be their complaints had led to take action against you. I'm ready to state the reason. But you have two daughters. They shouldn't feel ashamed, 'cause of your actions. Just 'cause you're working against me If you think I suspended you, then you're making a mistake. The school is scorching with heat why so? Is the heat too much? It's 'cause of your daughter Oh-- she's taking salary from the Govt. and is actually working? Ah-- she's here. -I'll speak to her, you can leave -Ok, Sir. Vanakkam madam. Come on, keep moving. Dear, check out this news. This boy in the news used to study at your school. [STUDENTS CHATTERING] Paandi Ammal, Kavitha, Karpagam Murgesan, Muthumaari, Pazhanisamy Why are we gathered here? Wonder, what she's gonna ask today? -she must drag something -Last year 9th grade You people have failed, 82 students. Do you know, how many have continued? To get good results in 10th grade, we have to filter them in 9th grade. Isn't that the procedure? My question was how many have continued to come to school? How would we know about that? seems like the next conflict is on... 28 students. 54 have discontinued. That means, you've destroyed 54 lives to dust. Do you know, what these kids are doing at the moment? Majority of them are wage workers and are on the accused list at the Police station. Why do we need schools to create criminals and wage workers? If they're not capable, obviously we have to fail them. Shall we conduct an exam for all the teachers? Let's see how many capable to be a Teacher. Whoever seems incapable, shall we chuck them out? If all these students file a case against you people proving you're wrong you'll end up compensating for their lifetime. Once you're defeated, they don't tend to turn back. That's why we ask them to return to the school, once they pass out SSLC. There's a pride in failing the SSLC but failing the 9th grade will considered uneducated. I'm telling you people now-- --those 82 students have passed. We don't have enough teachers. Moreover, they can't be taught. Don't call them incapable tell me, that you're incapable. Why do we need doctors for the healthy? If you can teach only to the smart students then don't call yourselves teachers. I'll get more teachers from, PTA fund. If that isn't enough, we'll get volunteers. Madam, last year results have been signed by CEO and DEO. -How's it possible? -Do you have a better idea? I'll be the class teacher for those 82 students. I'll handle the issues which will come my way. What are you doing? hit it hard. Idiot! fill in the sand into those dyes' stack them in order Brother, hold on for a minute -Aren't you Muthu Maari? -Yes. Murugesan, Velan, Ayyanar, Devi, Jennifer why are our names being called out?

It's a silly reason. We we're accused of cutting down the trees for the banner and a complaint was lodged with Forest Department. I've already made arrangements for the new banner. Do you want publicize my humiliation? Let it go, she's not worth the trouble. She's not working for just one school she overcame the education of half the riches in Tamilnadu. Others might come forward with loads of money for admissions. People stand in queue, in spite of the donation is 1 lac, do you know why? They don't send them here to study it's for their pride. If she enlightens them, it'll spread endlessly She's going overboard, no one to stop her. Sister, why didn't you pay your due? I did pay them, the other day they've been torturing me for it. Vannakam! Do you know, who am I? Obviously she knows you. Here, have this dear Wondering, why I was pretending not to recognize you? It's not good to be disrespectful of the guest. That's why-- do you think it's fair? you're luring someone in starvation with a well spread feast. In front of the school, where people are not well to do AC Rooms, colorful toys tours and fun activities. Won't they long for it? We will put up a banner, who are you to question? Are you trying to intimidate me in my own house? -Ey! -Mmmm. -It's not that Boss... -Hmmm. You mind your own business, and she will mind hers. If you create any problem she'll definitely make it tough for you. You can leave now. Fine, I'll mind my own business. I'll take a leave, Teacher. -Good Morning, Sir. -Mmmm. Listen-- The Collector is here. Ok, let him come, Sir. Please get up, he'll sit over there. Sir! -Hello Sir! -Hello... -Welcome to my School. Please sit down, Sir. Can't you offer coffee or tea for him? Govt. doesn't give me an expense account for that if you still insist, I'll buy from my own pocket. Not required. We're here for Inspection, come with us. You're here unannounced I have some work to do The school is ready for you, can proceed with Inspection. Chitra! What is it, Geetha? Who is our one day HM for the day? Mmmm, It's Kayalvizhi teacher. -Ask her to come. -Ok, Geetha. You can leave, Sir. She'll join you. (a + b)³ = ₐ₃ +3 a²b +3ab² -Good morning, Sir. +b³ (a - b)³ -Vanakkam, Sir. -Vanakkam! I'm Kayalvizhi. -Oh! One day HM. -Yes, Sir. Come on, let's go. The school looks different from before-- --it has changed a lot. -Shut up. Shall we complaint to Collector about our HM? What are you planning to complaint about? We were jobless, without doing our duties but now she's asking to do our jobs. Or there's no salt to dip mangoes? Continue pretending to work. Ey-- boys and girls stand in different queues -Come on, do it -Hold on... Give that cane to me Who's out there? Kalimuthu, come over here. -Where are you headed? -I'm off to Delhi. Show me your hand. -How are you planning to go? -By airplane. Ok, go. [MIMICS AIRPLANE SOUND] You made a stop at, Chandigarh. Give me that stick. -Who is going next? -Teacher, I wanna go... Teacher shall I go? Muthulakshmi, you come over here. How are you planning to go? I'm gonna take the train, teacher. Here take this stick, go. [MIMICS TRAIN SOUND] See, girls are winning these days. Applaud for her. Sir, they won't forget this in their lifetime. Next is Vishakapattinam, Arumugam -you can take the ship -Teacher... The Collector is here. Vanakkam, Sir. Take this, Teacher. It's fine, you please sit down. -Please sit down. -I'm fine, I will stand Please everyone go outside. You carry on with the kids, please continue. Everyone wait out here. Come on, sit down. Geetha Rani! Extremely arrogant, right? There's a huge list of complaints from your school. They must've planned to suspend you. Someone had sent me a message on whatsapp. That's why I came personally to meet. Do you want to check the files? Shall I ask them to get it? Ya, right! I used to be just like you in the beginning. Faced too many transfers. Couldn't take it. Shall I order lunch? Then you'll state it has to come out of your pocket. Not required, I'm leaving. Be careful. Sir, did you notice that woman is very arrogant. That's why, I gave her a stern warning. Ok, Sir. Thanks, Sir. I thought will get promoted as HM this year I wish to be the Head Master of the School at my native. One year, exactly one full year I made sure no one got appointed as HM. But that woman tarnished my dream into the dust. Now-- --now, I think my job is in danger. I've been ranting the same rubbish. we don't deserve this that too it's our town. I'm not gonna beat around the bush anymore. Strike her down with a strong blow. [INDISTINCT STUDENTS CHATTER] -She doesn't listen to us -You're being arrogant I asked her to sit next to me, but she went and sat next to him. stop it... -Geetha is here... -Laughter is quite much Nothing much, Geetha. So, tell me Ey-- you tell her. Fine, at this moment, you're our friend not a Teacher. Only then I'll tell you. Fine, tell me. -Sshhh! -There's a guy who travels in our bus he keeps smiling at her all the time. What's madam's reaction for that? Now even she's smiling back at him. Does it tickles your heart? no hunger, nor you can study smiling without your knowledge this is usual at your age I'll tell you all a story. Let's take life as a beautiful journey. At the end of that journey-- --there a exuberant treasure filled with gold and diamonds will be waiting for us. But won't be visible to us. We will move seeking towards it. On the way, we'll find bits and pieces of the gold. Just like this. Looking at that, if you think you got your treasure the journey will end right there. Who continues to seek till the end ignoring it they will find that treasure. So, what is it Farhana? I'm going to take a different bus from tomorrow. Ey-- come on guys. Oh God, no... Ey-- the truck goons are here. What do we do now? Ey-- get out! -Go! -Oh Damn! -Hey... -Ey, take my bag You refused to send the kids with us. That too in our own town. Don't think, you can make the rules. Ah-- Ey-- close that door. Brother, please don't do it. Let us show here what "Fear" is all about. Please brother, don't do it. Doesn't matter, if it's a man or a woman who stands up against us shouldn't forget us for their lifetime Ey-- scar her face. Ey...! -Can you open the door? -Sure, Madam -Need to wash my hands -Sure, madam Ey-- who's got the keys open the door, damn it. She's a strong woman she fights like a professional She just gave me one beating my mouth is swollen, brother. Damn, she beat him up. CEO said, that The Collector is on her side. The entire town should go against her. You work from inside and I'll take care of the rest here. Will you do it right? I will do it, Sir. Dear, I went out for lunch and had Biryani. Sorry, you had made lunch for me but I didn't eat. Did you eat? Hope you're not stressed out? fine, close your eyes Did you close your eyes? take a deep breath feel free... Ok? Bye, dear. Ok, Dad. don't be roaming around, go home and take rest. Kathir! Come in. They made sweets at home today. Thank you! -Did you eat it? -Mmmm! Then, you have to marry me What!? My cousin mentioned that if she takes the sweet from me and eats we'll get married it seems. That's why, I didn't give it to her. Now that you've eaten it you have to get married to me. Fine, I'll marry you but you gotta wait for me until you grow older -Ok!? -Sure, I'll wait. But this secret should be within us. Mmm-hmm, I won't mention it to anyone. Fine, get to the class. [STUDENTS QUARRELING AND FIGHTING] Students, what are you doing here? everyone get to the class. Sir, why are you not stopping them? It will become an issue, madam. Why are you scared to stop the fight between the kids? It's better you don't get involved in this. Nonsense! Stop it! Listen to me damn it, stop the fight. Maariappa! Ey-- Azaghu please listen, stop it Ey-- what's all this, stop it. Stop... Stop it! Ey-- Sundaram! Stop it. [STUDENTS GASPING FOR BREATH] What is happening out here? These guys hit one of our guys. WE can't be calm, if one of our guy is beaten up. That's why we gave them back. What do you mean by that? ***** people ***** people In one hour, all their threads should be burned to ashes. Madam, please understand this is a sensitive matter we're here from different cities for work don't we need to lookout for ourselves. It's not my duty to provide you protection. If you're scared, then don't get out of your houses. Who knows, the roof might fall on your head. First page of every book, states encouraging haptic is a crime. Seems like you guys have never gone through that. It happened, exactly like I mentioned look where she has dragged us all We shouldn't let that woman step inside the school anymore. Treasury ma'am, do you know one thing that head mistress, removed the caste bands off the students. The caste fanatics are restless with their rage. We can never change them they apply for caste certificate before birth certificate people from other parts of the world are reaching out to moon but over here, the carve a space in assembly and rule the nation in the name of caste. Look, they've started already. I have to see, who is this woman. Ma'am, let's meet her together. "Geetha Rani, Down...Down!" "Transfer, Geetha Rani" "Transfer the Head Master" "Geetha Rani, Down...Down!" "Transfer the head master" "Geetha Rani, Down...Down!" Sir, she's our head master. Vanakkam, sir. -Are you the head master, Geetha Rani? -Yes. Officers are on the way, they'll discuss and resolve it you don't have to step inside, please leave. Aren't they protesting against me? I'll speak to them myself. If something goes wrong with you, who will take the responsibility? If it does, I'll take the responsibility. Brother, please take this. [SLOGANEERING CONTINUES] Please listen to what I have to say. Can you people just listen to what I have to say? All you people want is for me to leave, right? Fine, I'll resign from my post. Is that enough? As I'm going to leave-- --shall I ask you people 3 questions? They're webbed now. What are your questions? Go on ask them. First let me ask them a question I like people who stand up for themselves. Especially I like them the most, who stand up against me. Tamilnadu govt. Budget from last year is 1,90,000 crores from that 70,000 crores goes to salaries and pensions for the govt. Employees. Which in fact amounts to 35% of the total there are 18 lacs, govt. Employees. From the public share of 3%, 35% goes as income. Teachers have equal share in it. Still-- the salary isn't enough, facilities aren't enough you people who protest for silly reasons the quality of education is bad students don't receive basic amenities system should bring a change have you ever protested with these demands? Chief vanakkam. Your flag is fluttering all over the town. There's a party office at every town. But if that served as a medium to fulfill public demands, would've been good. You pose your caste is behind with full support that paved success to your entire family. But how many have you upraised from your caste? According the quota allotted, how many have pursued higher education or have seeked out govt. Jobs or have been approved bank loans at least have you helped them seek MSME skilled labor? Except for your henchmen and your so called slaves. Come on, reply. Are you trying to turn my people against me? I have one more question I don't have to answer your questions. I know how to tackle you. Ey-- come on, let's leave. Who the hell is this lady? She has a point though. You're always against the teachers. I'm supportive of the students. If you don't do your job, in spite of getting paid I believe that should be added to the list of scams. I'm very sure of it. Children of 38 teachers of our school are studying in schools. Raise your hands, how many have their children study at govt. School? When you don't believe in yourself how do you expect me to trust you? Just those 5, you guys tell me should I step inside or not? She faces anything with true grit. When questioned, reverts with force. Now, she's known to the entire town. If we try to hurt her our image will be tarnished. Our next move should be a big one Ey-- you were very enthused, but now you've done squat about it. I can hear your bloody mind voice. That teacher, teaching me a lesson too our next blow to her she should remember us for her lifetime. But we need to know about her background thoroughly. I'm aware now... Madam knows that you were behind everything AHM who went against, is relentlessly frequenting the court. You've completed the job I'm pretty sure, your job is... "Parade, turn right!" One, two, three, four...One! "Parade, march forward!" "Turn left" one, two, three, four...One! "Parade, caution!" One! "Parade, caution!" One! "Parade, march left" "turn left" one, two, three, four...One! "Parade, march forward" "march briskly" "One, two, one" "One, two, one" "parade, halt!" "Coming to halt... one, two" Ey--Ranganathan look over there. Ah-- what's happening? "Line cut!" -Ma'am, how are you? -I'm very good. -How's everything? -All fine. And is everything good? -Everything is fine... -Ok, ma'am I'll leave. If we get hold of him, we'll know everything. Go and get him. Singh ji! Singh, Singh, sing...Even his walk is like he's running. Do you know her? What were you guys speaking about? Where did she come from? I can't understand, Tamizh. And I can't understand, Hindi. Ey-- get someone who knows Hindi. -How can I find someone here? -Go, damn it. Hindi, where are you? [Sings in joy] Sir, this is not Hindi Let that go, come on. You brought a small kid sir, he's the son of pani puri vendor he speaks good Hindi. Look at him, he's round like a puri. -Namaste, sir ji. -Namaste. -Did you see that? -I know Hindi, sir. Ask him, what I had asked you they wanted to know, what was Madam's previous profession? Madam is great and very strong.

According to your category under Civil range, Thasildar, Deputy Collector you can be either of it. But you're stubborn on being a head master. Why? Oh, did you get a promotion from military school? Fine, instead of choosing a big cities like Coimbatore and Madurai but you've chosen an unknown town down south. -That's where I should be, sir. -Eh? Ok... ...sounds like you have a plan in your mind. All the best! Take care. Sir, when am I getting my due paid? I had a doubt, when she instigated the state government. That she must be from the central government. You're doomed. You've shown your antics to an elephant. -Military!? -Hmmm. A person who travels empty hand in the dark than the person who travel with a flame torch the latter will have more grit my grandmother used to mention it. Must be true. In fact, it's true. Never knew she was that dictator. Socrates-- silent, silent... Brother, you seem very silent today. No, no, nothing like that, madam. You said the right thing, the other day. You can't blame the teachers all together. The system is not right. There's a kid next to our house he scored centum in maths but scored 64% in biology and failed in 12th grade. Do you think he'll be able to pursue, BSc.Mathematics? They won't let him, right. So, we lost a mathematics genius. Head master ma'am, toppers are not genius. You can take it as, they're good at mugging up. This system has turned engineers into food delivery boys. That means, the system is a failure. What crap is this, it's in English. What is this letter about? Coming week, there's district level tournament happening. Fine, we'll do it. District level tournaments are about to begin even this year our school's name should be in papers. Ok, Sir. If that doesn't happen you can't find your names under teachers list. Don't even bother to collect your salaries. Ok, Sir. You're always munching. That's exercise for the mouth. I'm not working out though -at least let my mouth work out -you'll never change. You're faking the accounts right? Keep at it. The road looks hazy, after evaluating the papers. Sir good morning, sir. Sir, good morning. HM has summoned you. -For what? -I have no idea. Sir, give me your hand come on give it to me, will return it. You gathered a crowd, right? Congratulations for your suspension. Go, I have to eat my chips. Tell me teacher, you had summoned me. Take this. What is that? What is it, teacher? -Take it -what is it, madam? Next week there's Junior District Tournament you be the in-charge of it. Madam, he's a maths teacher. -I'm a Tamizh teacher. -Oh! Are you looking for OD or money from PTA funds there's no set rule that a Tamizh teacher has to attend it. Last 6 years, you've been in-charge our school never won a prize. This year even if he can't win a prize there's no difference in it. He managed to gather a crowd for the protest. We'll finally know, if he's really worth it or a dummy. Incorrigible! Ey-- get back. Everyone get back. No PET master should be seen close to the field If I see them will disqualify their team. Get back, come on get back. Ask them come accordingly Sir, our students made the long jump. Over here, my verdict is final. If you still dispute it, will disqualify your team. Out! Madam, did you see what they're doing? Madam, we should be winning their measurements are wrong. Won't you question them? Your anger is valid but you're venting it out at the wrong place. Sir, shall I ask you 3 questions? Mmmm, go on. Sir, do you have a clear vision? Or at least you know the difference between one and two? Wait, let me ask the 3rd question will you agree, if your child is given a different initial? You're giving away their rightful victory to someone else. Damn it! How dare you speak to me like that? I'll whack you. I'm disqualifying your team. Which school are you from? I'm gonna disqualify your entire school. Get out! Out! Get out! If you ask what nature consists of moon, sun, sky... Did they call out our school's name? Why do you look so nervous? I can feel your heartbeat on your shoulder. I'm scared that we'll lose the competition. If that's the case, it's awesome. Only the winner should be scared. But we are going to lose, why should be scared? I went through your content. It's awesome. A packet of 10 potato chips, must be 1 buck but they sell it for 10 bucks through packaging and advertisements. So, content 10%, presentation 90% success 100% gather all our students. Come on, get them. Come on, let's go. First, I'm going to disqualify you. -Sir!? -Suspension bonus. Re-conduct all the events handled by him. [PARTICIPANTS CHEER WITH JOY] -Do you understand now? -I do, sir. So, nothing to be scared. There's no issue. Next on stage is S.Vadivel of R-Puthur Govt. Higher Secondary School. Go! [PARTICIPANTS INDISTINCT CHATTER] "Let no ear listen to my squabble" "LET NO EAR LISTEN TO MY SQUABBLE" "Nor any eye shall witness my actions" "If you ask why? I'm going to talk to the nature." "Nature helps us breathe" "Nature offers fragrance" "Nature offers music too" On your mark! Get set! [STUDENTS CHEERING] If a rooster and a chicken is pit against each other who do you think will win? We can survive only, if the world doesn't know their roosters Why do you think I spend a fortune and send you guys there? She's just one person, you guys are useless. Just quit the job and leave. Get lost! Sorry, Sir! Fine... Speak to those 8 students get them into our school under free quota. It's 8 seats, Sir if we say 50k/person, it's still 4 Lacs. Last year we spent 14 Lacs on promotions. If we take them in-- --they'll make sure at least 10 times their names will appear on the newspapers. Free Promotions! So, our expenses will cut down to half. We can save 3 Lacs from it. So don't teach me economics. He wanted to meet you-- --he is the AHM of that school. Vanakkam, Sir. I was told you used to be an AHM? That's right, Sir. I was good at my job. But that lady suspended me out of the blue. This is your side of the story we should inquire out there too, you get to the point. Teachers out there are having a tough time. We have to take notes should be disciplined she imposed strict rules we end up slogging like cows just as Private school teachers It's Annual day at the school in two days I'm sure that school will be your strong competitor. -He's thinking in our favour. -Yes, Boss.

I was scared, how my son's life would turn out Sir, you sent a flower bouquet but nothing happened It will happen, have patience. May I come in, Madam? May I please come in, Madam? Come in. I'm coming from MSC School. Our correspondent sent me to meet you. Sit down! Thank you, Madam. Your work is amazing. The entire town is raving about you. Your services shouldn't be constrained to this small circle. The Govt. won't respect your talent. Only the Private Sector, will know your rightful place how to raise your bar also how to respect your talents. what I'm trying to say is, at our MSC School should take up the position of respectable Head Master. That's our Sir's wish too. To express that friendship, he sent a bouquet. Also... one another thing Take this. -What is it? -5 Lacs in cash. Sir asked to give it to you. You want me to work in your favor, right? If I meet him, will convey that you were grateful to him. Please take this and leave. Madam, Sir is a very good person. You just list your demands I'll speak to Sir and make arrangements. You seem wiser should've given a thought, when this job was given to you -That... -but you didn't Get out, damn it! She was disrespectful, Sir she asked me to get out. Get out, damn it. She was way better... I had something else in mind. What was it? -I thought it was a bomb... -Boss... Did you peck me for a heartless killer? You're asking to kill the children. You're not fit to be a teacher. There's a huge difference between killing and winning. She bloody challenged me I will win against her. But, you get out from my school. Get out! I have another idea, Sir. What is it? 82 students who failed the 9th grade last year-- --were cleared and sent to the 10th grade by her. Exams are going to start in 10 days. the hall tickets have come. Lawyer advised that, we can file a case against her. You've said it right? The Idea is good. I'll take care of it. Don't be inside my school, just get out. Disgusting Creature! Clean the spot, where he was standing -Call my son-in-law -Ok, Boss. Come in What did you get me today? I didn't get anything. Then? People came to ask my neighbor's hand in marriage. Oh-Oh! I asked them why? Asking ones hand in marriage is the first step to marriage. Then you have to get engaged. Later you can get married at your convenience. So...? Shall I ask your hand in marriage? Ey-- you're going overboard. Should I call your parents? Not required, my brother will come and ask your hand in marriage my brother studies here too, in 7th grade I'm gonna whack you, go back to the class. Are you angry? Sir, here take this new pencil. Wow, the one with the rubber on the back. He's a tiny brat he's speaking about marriage and engagement. May be he's reminding you of something. People are still asking your hand in marriage.

Ah-- now Dad's gonna treat you close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Feel free... Ok! Bye, dear. I love you, Daddy. Are students ready for their exam? I too pecked you for a stone-hearted. You have every right to be angry. Sir, just like you asked-- --we settled it with your brother-in-law at Dindivanam. -Your work will be done -Thank you. -Father-in-law -What's the status? I just got done with the job. your timing was perfect. The deal is done. Not even a student can write the exam tomorrow. That's great. Students, you guys are ready to write your exams you're going to face many changes. But I have a penitence the year is about to end, since I got here. I never did any work. She never worked? I pushed you guys to study. I pushed them to teach you guys. If you gain victory, it's the result of your hard work In case, if something goes wrong I'm fully responsible for it. I envy looking at few teachers over here. The books he selects for the students if its read in full, he rewards them with 100 rupees. He stands by the notion, that books can change the society. Practical skills of their sort-- --is equal to Noble thesis. An entire Maths formula-- --he's turns them into a song and makes the students sing it. My only penitence is that only a handful teachers are available. In spite of advanced technology, you people are backward. In Govt.Medical College, not even 1% is allotted to Govt.School students. And in Govt. Engineering colleges is less than 5%. Students who are below poverty line study at Govt. Schools. Just 50% reservation for their higher education we can eradicate the poverty line. But I'm unsure, what is the Govt's idea of eradicating the poverty. If that's the case how long will be our run? Based on your scores the world is waiting to grade you.

High School Geetha Rani, a Head Master at that school was arrested around 10:30am at the school premises. The year before she joined the duty students who did not clear the 9th grade she misused her authority has been accused that she let them write the 10th grade exams.
