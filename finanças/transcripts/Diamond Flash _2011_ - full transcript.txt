I just want you to believe me. I believe you. But that's not the point. What is the point? - You're making mistakes. That's the problem. I told you I fell down the stairs. Look, I'm aware that this is a very difficult situation. But I'm here to help. You're not helping. On the contrary, you're harassing me. Can?t you tell? Is it that hard to believe that I fell down the stairs? Have you never fallen down? Yes, I have. Well, we all do sometimes. I?m very clumsy. Maybe if you asked your daughter to leave, we could talk more calmly. My daughter stays with me. Besides, we have nothing to talk about. I don't agree. Why do you feel entitled to suggest such a thing? You?re insulting me! Me and my family in front of my face! What?s up with you? You know what I think? You've been wrong many times before... Do you visit all the women that fall down the stairs in Madrid? I visit those that fall down three times in a month. Look, I know you?re doing your job, but please, leave me alone. It?s not what it seems, I swear. Leave me alone, please. Okay, I?m sorry, I didn?t mean to offend you. In any case, if you want to talk... about anything... Call me anytime. This is our organization?s card. Ask for Paz. Either way, I?d like us to talk soon. Good afternoon. What are you reading? - A comic book. Comic? What's that? Like a cartoon? Didn?t you buy the Super Pop magazine? - No. I thought you loved it. If you don't like that comic... I won't buy it for you. I know you well. Okay. What?s the comic about? Mortadelo? - No. Then what? - It?s about superheroes. I didn?t know you liked that kind of thing. Yes. So what?s the story of the comic? Well... It?s about a man who?s abducted by aliens... and turns into a cyborg. Into a what? Into a cyborg. A cyborg... What?s that? Like a robot? Well, yes, but robots are just machines. Cyborgs are half man half machine. How can that be? I don?t know... By having mechanical arms... And that?s it? They gave him some orthopedic arms and that's it? That?s what the Martians abducted him for? No, they?re not Martians and they didn?t give him orthopedic arms. So what do they do to him? They operate on him and give him superpowers. I don?t get it. They give him super strength, super speed, that kind of stuff... And what do they give him superpowers for? I don't know, to fight against evil. To kill the bad guys? No, superheroes don?t kill. What do you mean? They don?t, they have rules. They don't kill... even if their enemies are really bad? No, superheroes are good. Yeah, me too. But imagine if they gave me superpowers and I caught a rapist or an ETA member... Honey, why don?t you read the Super Pop magazine? No. I don?t think that comic is good for you... Come on, go downstairs and buy it. I said no! Come on, Elena. Don?t be stubborn. - No, Mum! Damn it! FAMILY Don't worry. I'm sure she'll turn up, okay? First of all, I want to let you know that we are going to do everything we can to find your daughter as soon as possible. Most of the children that disappear during school trips... come back at night, after spending the day out. But I think it?s best to start searching right now. No, no, no... Excuse me? - Alba isn't like that, she wouldn?t do that. Right... She never went out without your permission or came back after hours? No. I see. Her teacher remembers seeing her during the whole time, so she probably disappeared during the return journey. It?s all her teachers fault. Excuse me? My daughter?s teacher is responsible for her disappearance. It?s possible, I know but... we've been talking to her and... I can guarantee you she?s very upset. Okay good, but she?s my daughter. There?s no doubt about that. Are you going to look for her as if she was yours? Of course. That's my job. You said it, it?s your job. I want to report that woman for child neglect. Do as you wish, but I think... right now we have to put all our efforts into finding Alba. What was she wearing? A pink tracksuit and a pink backpack with flowers. Do you have enemies? Someone who could hurt your daughter? No... At least nobody I know of. Have you had a major conflict with someone? We may play down the importance of our actions as time go by. Think it over well. Maybe something happened many years ago... No, I already told you. All right... Do you live with Alba?s father? No, just Alba and me. Are you divorced? No, I met him 10 years ago and I haven?t seen him since. Could you tell me more about the father? I think he lives in Italy and has another family. He wants nothing to do with Alba and I nothing with him. There?s nothing more to tell. You?ll have to give me his name because we may have to contact him. I also need... a recent photo of your daughter. A recent photo? Yes. Where we can see her well. I have to look for one. Violeta, these pictures are of a much younger girl. Yes, I know. Don?t you have a more recent one? No... I don't like pictures and neither does my daughter. Maybe there?s one from a recent birthday party or trip? How is possible that you don?t have pictures of your daughter? I didn?t think it was that important until now. Let's see... Does she have any documentation, a passport, school paperwork...? Yes, but all the photos are from 5 or 6 years ago. You don?t understand, I can?t even make her pose for an ID card. It's impossible. Violeta, make an effort. Why don?t you ask some mother of a friend of Alba's? Maybe they have a picture of a recent birthday party where she appears. I already told you I?m going to do all I can to find your daughter, but to do that... I need that photograph. Hello, Maite. Hello, Hi, Pedro. Hello, Fuensanta. I?m Violeta, Alba?s mother. I was wondering.. if... you happen to have a picture... of your son with Alba? In a birthday party or something like that. Me? Yes I do, but they're from... No, I?m... I had them in my computer and the hard disk broke down. No, it broke down. If you?d be so kind... Yes, thank you. I'll wait. Yes? Nothing? Not one? Would you mind... you sure have one from... a school trip or... Yes, she was a very shy girl. Maybe she?s in the background... Yes, they've been together since elementary school. You must have some pictures... Sure, take one more look. Yes, please, If you?d be so kind... Yes? Nothing? No, no, it's OK. Yes, don?t worry... I'm sure I?ll find one. Yes, thanks, see you later. What kind of mother doesn?t have a photo of her daughter? Do you think that?s normal? Well... I?m a piece of shit. Don't say that. A fucking piece of shit. Fucking shit. Violeta... Look... Alba doesn't like pictures... Everybody knew that. But it?s not your fault. Every child has an obsession. For example, a son of one of my colleagues... can't sleep with toys since he saw Toy Story. And when I was little, I was very afraid of dogs. Horrified! Don?t punish yourself. Look... What do you think about this? When Alba comes back... I?m going to give her Jaime?s Polaroid. It?s been gathering dust in storage since he bought the digital camera. That way she?ll get used to it, and little by little she?ll lose her fear. Right? That?s going to be my birthday present for her. A Polaroid camera? Yes... Jaime?s Polaroid. Are you all right? Violeta... Are you feeling well? Violeta? Violeta, open the door, please. Violeta, are you OK? Answer, please. She locked herself in. Are you OK? Jaime, stay with me tonight. Of course, whatever you need. Aren?t you going to eat? Violeta. You have to eat something. I?m not hungry. OK, but you have to try and eat something. Can I make you some mashed potatoes or something? I don?t want anything, really. Everything will be fine. Thank you for staying with me tonight. You don?t have to thank me. I?ll make some tea. Do you want something? Yes, but don?t worry. I?ll do it myself. No, I want to do it. What would you like? Some tea. Thank you. Jaime... Do you... Do you miss Mom and Dad? Of course. I don't. Do you really want to talk about this right now? I think I don?t miss them... because I don?t remember them well. Well, you weren't that young when they died. Right... Well, now that I think about it I do have one memory. A very clear one, in fact. Regarding? Regarding the last summer we spent with them. I prefer not to remember that summer. Yeah... Do you remember that we celebrated your birthday on the Calpe beach? Yes. I remember there was a show about tales on TV that night. The drawings were beautiful. No, not about fairy tales, it was about cinema. I thought they?d air it every week but I never saw it again. Ana and Rodrigo were there too, with their huge dog. Do you remember? We called him Falkor, like the dragon from The Neverending Story. They gave you... They gave you an album as a present. A Country in Flames by Radio Futura. I remember it perfectly because I liked the cover a lot. Then there?s the present Mom and Dad gave you. Do you remember it? What? The present Mom and Dad gave you. Yes... What was it? I don?t know... a... a camera. A Polaroid camera. Jaime. Whatever happens tonight... I want you to know that I love you, I love you very much. I'm feeling really bad, Violeta. This isn't normal. Violeta. Please help me. Take me to bed. Violeta! Take me to bed! No, you better stay like that. What?s going on? We have to talk. Talk? I feel horrible. Can?t you see it? You have to call an ambulance. There?s no need for it. I can help you. Then why don?t you do it? Did you do this to me? Why? Because I want to find Alba. Do you... Do you think I... had something to do... with that? No. Then why are you doing this to me? Did you know Alba is terrified of photographs? What? Alba hates it when someone takes pictures of her. I thought it was normal because I hate it too. Today I found out why we have that irrational fear. It's because of you. What are you talking about? You know it perfectly well. No, no... I don't know. You?re scaring me. You have to help me. Whatever it is... We can calmly talk it out. Today I remembered everything, Jaime. What happened the summer Mom and Dad died. Whatever happened? You?re going to make me say it, right? What you did back then isn't humiliating enough for you? I don?t know what you?re talking about. You know nothing about those pictures, nor about the Polaroid camera? Nothing, right? What are you insinuating? You sexually abused me and my daughter. No, no... You don?t know what you?re talking about. You?ve... gone completely mad. Don?t say that! Take it back! I haven?t lost my mind. I remember clearly what happened! I take it back. I take it back. Calm down. Alba is missing and you're very nervous. But you?re mistaken. You have to try and calm down. Please. That?s right. The only thing that matters now is to find Alba. Jaime, listen to me. Right now, it doesn?t matter what happened between the two of us. Not even what you did to her. I just want to find her. I want to find her too. but you?re wrong. You have to call an ambulance. I feel really bad. I know you want to help me. I know. That?s why I need you to tell me where the pictures... you've taken of my daughter during all this time are. I need a recent photo. We?ll crop it out for the police, only her face will remain. Violeta, I don?t have pictures of your daughter. You?re not getting it. I've remembered everything. It?s very simple. You?re a pedophile. Who are you trying to kid? Don?t you realize you?re dying? Please, help me. You said you love me. Of course I love you... but you?ve abused my daughter and don?t want to help me find her. Aren?t those enough reasons to kill you? I haven?t abused Alba. - Enough! You?ve gone crazy. - Shut up! Please... I just want all this to be over. If you really love me, please, believe me. Stop doing that, I?m serious. You always play the reasonable guy to make me look like a madwoman in front of everyone. You always do it. And I hate it. Do you hear me? I hate it. Jaime, look... If you tell me where the photos are, I won?t say anything to the police. Everything will stay among the family. As if... nothing of this ever happened. I'll forgive you if my daughter returns. And who will forgive you? Where are you going? Violeta, where are you going? - To your house, to talk to Matilde. No. Don?t get her into this. I tried to do it by fair means. At least the best I could. Leave Matilde alone. I?m warning you. Do you think you can threaten me? I?m going to your house... and I'm going to rummage in there until I find what I'm looking for. And then I?m going to show it to your wife. Goodbye. Don?t leave me alone! OK! OK. I admit it! I'm sorry... Where are the pictures of my daughter? I?m going to tell you, but you have you help me first. No, this doesn?t work that way. Go to my house and talk to my wife. I'll be dead, and you won't have found Alba. You'll never be able to prove that I took those pictures... because they?re stashed away... and because nobody will believe a murderer. Jaime, please, tell me where they are. You better help me first. All right... When you feel better you'll tell me where the pictures are, right? That's right. You won't hit me? I won't hit you. Swear to me. I swear. Swear by Mom and Dad. I swear... by... Mom and Dad. No! What are you doing? You won't comply. You'll hurt me when you're free. What are you doing, Violeta? Please tell me where they are. Tell me once and for all. I don't have the fucking pictures. And I never took naked pictures of you. I don't have them. Get it? Since you insist I'll tell you. It was the day after your birthday. We were having a school competition. You had your new camera and a beach pail. You took several pictures... And when the game was over asked me to... go with you to the beach to catch some crabs. You said that that was the best time for it. We got to the beach later. There was almost nobody there. And... - Violeta... You told me... that you knew of a cave where there were a lot of crabs. And... you told me... - Violeta... He went with you to the beach. I stayed home making you a trophy. I didn't know you were going to lose. I didn't go with you. It was Dad. UNKNOWN SENDER Alba Photograph I heard that Alba's disappeared and you're looking for a photograph. This was taken two months ago. I hope it helps I'm really sorry. What's wrong, Violeta? Violeta, what's the matter? Let me see that message. Who wrote that message, Violeta? Girl is missing in Arganzuela neighborhood. ...it's like that, like faking it, because things really don't... happen like it seems. I mean, the camera makes it look that way, but... it's just a bunch of japs that have a trained monkey... well, there's a guy who trained him, he goes around with a white dog, a backpack and... there was a... the first one I saw... the monkey got scared... and there was a snake. and the monkey... the dog came to help - it looked like the end of the monkey - it was more useless than the monkey, I mean the dog... But the monkey's wearing jewelry and that always wins the day. A monkey with breast jewelry... and they send him to buy cantaloupes. he starts trying things... and finally eats something that... is spicy, and so he's on fire... It's really good, and... he pulls the monkey... I'm leaving. Okay, but... I mean... Why don't you stay a while? Sorry, gotta go. - But... why now? I mean... What's your hurry? - It's late for me. Bu... - I can't stay a second longer. We can... talk another day. Give me your number... - I don't think so... Well, give me your email address... - No. I'll give you mine. It's... See you. - Facebook! Are you in Facebook? I'll send you a request! Yes? Hi, Luc?a. It's certainly bad. Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't feeling well. I would have called. Yeah, but now I'm cooking. It's not a good time. No, really, Luc?a. Later on I've got to run. Look, don't insist. I'm not opening. You okay? - Yes. Pass the paper towels, please. Are you going to sign it? No. Look at me. Just for a moment. - Let me clean this up. I have nothing to wait for. Do you think I can't see the bruise because of the makeup? If you're going to insist with that again... then you shouldn't have come up. No... I really don't care about what you prefer. Come on, get your coat and let's leave. We're going to report Julio. Yes, we're going to report him! If not... I'm not coming back here. Elena, don't do this. Let's go. - I can't report him now. If not now, then when? I don't know, but not now. Elena... Julio is a batterer, right? Like the ones on TV. But this is not TV. This is the real thing. Please, stop pestering me. He doesn't pester you, right? - No. All right, I can go with you or without you. Hang on a moment. Listen to me. What can you tell me to justify this? Think you can convince me that Julio is a good guy who's promised to change? Don't fuck with me. No, Luciana. Julio is a son of a bitch, okay? I don't love him and I don't think he'll change. Look... Let's do the following: just listen to me for five minutes. And if you're not convinced by what I tell you... you can go and report him to the police... and do whatever you want. But please, don't go now. Just listen to me! Around two months ago... there was a day when I stayed late at the shop. Some new material had arrived, so I thought I'd stay and organize it and listen to some music... in my own time, just chilling out... and suddenly it was three o'clock in the morning. So when I locked up I thought: I'm not going to wait a whole hour for the bus. It's a safe area, so I started walking home. And then as I walked through the park... I started to feel I was being followed. Well... At first I wasn't scared because I thought that... perhaps I was just getting paranoid. So I walked on. Until suddenly I noticed that someone had stopped me, by grabbing my arm. And... I don't know... I went... like... blank. And when I was about to turn... I heard a guy's voice from behind: Turn around and I'll cut your throat. Jesus! I had the knife here! And I kept on wishing for everything to happen as fast as possible! As fast as possible! And then... I don't know how... I started to hear blows... and screams. And I lay on the ground motionless and with my eyes shut out of fear. I don't know how long this lasted, but it wasn't long. Because suddenly it all became quiet. What happened? I don't know. Suddenly, someone tapped my shoulder. And I opened my eyes. So what did you see? I saw a man... A man dressed in black. In black from top to bottom. There was something on his face. Look... Something like what? Elena! Tell me, for God's sake! - It was a mask. Mask? - That's right. I... knew that there were two unconscious men lying on the ground. But I never had a look at them. I could only look at him. Get it? So... what did he do? He asked me... he asked me if I was all right. He had a very strange voice. So... what did you do? I kissed him. You kissed him? It was my first impulse, I kissed his mask. I was just gob smacked. But it wasn't just that. I asked him to save me from Julio. No, Elena. Things don't just happen this way. Don't you understand? I never felt... anything in my fucking life like I felt... that day and I've been feeling like that for over two months. Not even when I was fifteen! Do you know what I'm talking about? I can't get it out of my head! I go to sleep thinking about him. And I wake.. I wake up thinking about him. I'm obsessed. Luc?a! I can't report Julio. Because I need an excuse to see that man again. What is it? - Just looking at you. Do you like what you see? It could be better. Fuck that! Have you been up long? About an hour. I went out for a walk. What time is it? Around eleven. Gotta make breakfast. I could do it. You do everything. You can make the next one if you want. But now you're keeping me company I just want to help. I don't want you to feel I'm a nuisance. How could you be a nuisance? I love being with you. And I'm so glad you came. I'm glad too. Do you remember anything from last night? From last night? Nothing? I don't know. What do I have to remember? That's a foolish question. I had to wake you up. Well? You were having a nightmare. You were talking in your sleep. Then you began to cry. Was I talking to myself or to someone? You seemed to be talking to someone. To whom? - I don't know. I can't remember. And what was I saying? You were saying something about wanting to be taught how to dance. Well, we had a late dinner. I also had the strangest dreams. Really? They weren't really nightmares, just very weird dreams. I was with Roc?o, with the singer Roc?o Jurado. We were walking through a forest, and it was like we were childhood friends. We are following a man, and the man suddenly stops... and Rocio Jurado hands me a shovel. So I start digging and digging... and digging... And suddenly I notice I've made contact with something hard. When I look I see a surface that's like a mirror. And then... you woke me up. I'm sorry, Mar?a. You know what happens to me frequently? I... wake up and I can't move. And sometimes I hear people around me... and there's nobody there. That's frightening! It's a question of relaxing and going back to sleep. Something wrong? You've been kind of strange since you arrived. Are you nervous? No. Well, perhaps a little bit. Lola! Everything's fine. Right? You're with me. Enriqueta called. She's coming tomorrow around twelve. I'm looking forward to her return and going back to my house in Madrid. By the way... Enriqueta is dying to meet you. The feeling is mutual. IDENTTITY Shall I read your cards? You know how to do it? Didn't I tell you? - No. I always get it right. Do you have Tarot cards? They don't have to be Tarot cards. Ordinary cards work too. We don't have ordinary cards. You're right. Hang on. Where are you going? - I have an idea. What's that? - Some stickers. Where did you get them? There's a room upstairs with stickers, toys... What is it? - Nothing. Whose are they? - I don't know. Have they been there long? - Did you notice? They're dinosaur stickers. A bit of everything, in fact. The name is prehistoric animals. Is there a problem? Don't you like my cards? No... don't get upset. Dinosaur stickers! Okay... 'prehistoric animals'. There's 48 cards, like in Spanish decks. Lola, Tarot cards are just symbols. And these prehistoric animals are also symbols. They'll do just fine. Shuffle them. Should I think about something? - As you wish. Pick three. No! Don't look at them. Will you show me a trick or will you tell my future? Just pick three. Health, money and love. C'mon, are you ready? - Yes. Health. Now that's interesting. A Triceratops. AKA three horned dinosaur. You're lucky. This is a very good card. Come again? This means you're as healthy as a bull. You're really healthy and you'll live a long life. And, besides, we all know that Triceratops were vegetarians. Not predators. You should go on a vegetable-rich diet and mostly avoid meat. Okay, now for money. Fish-shaped reptile. Fuck me, you're on a roll. This is also a very good card. How can I put it? Only really lucky people draw this card. Sure. - Sure. You'll become a financial wizard. You'll be loaded. You'll work on Wall Street. You'll be living in NY. But I love Madrid. And I'm not interested at all in the stock exchange or Wall Street. Thing is, you and I have no say in this. Prehistoric animals are the ones that determine our destiny. Well... Shit, Lola, you'll be loaded! You can come to Madrid whenever you want. Only one card left. The love card. Are you nervous? - I'm about to faint. Uintatherium skull. I envy you. This card is a symbol of pure, true love. A crystal clear, eternal love... Can you see it? You'll meet a wonderful girl. - Wouldn't that be you? Doesn't look like it. Do you mind? Well, I'm really sorry. But wait... Wait because I can tell you some more stuff. I can tell you the first letter in your lover's name. It's 'M', it starts with 'M'. You get all that from the cards, right? Don't belittle me. I always get it right. Don't we have to feed the girl? Yes. - I can do it. I don't know... - C'mon... Why the interest? - So I can start getting used to it. Okay... but don't call her by her name. And don't mention your own name. I've brought you some fruit. Do you like fruit? Fruits are nature's candies. Nice outfit! Do you like sports? What is your favorite sport? - I don't know. Handball is my favorite sport. Don't you want to take you jacket off? Will you hurt my mother if I don't? No... I don't want to hurt your mom. Who told you that? Was it the other girl? Do you love your mother? You don't need to fear me, Alba. I'm your friend! My name's Lola. I'll tell you something. Okay? But you have to promise not to tell anyone else. Not even the other girl. First you have to promise. Do you promise? Tomorrow, I'll take you to your mother. Do you like fireworks? It so happens that we test fireworks here. And sometimes we bring children to tell us if they're really loud or not. So don't get frightened if you hear them tomorrow, okay? It's part of the experiment. And then... I'll take you to your mom. But meanwhile you have to stay here. And you have to eat all your food. Did you see it? - No. You didn't see it last night? You have to see it. You can see it when we return to Madrid, okay? Well, we were at my uncle's house... and our... cousin says... Why don't we make a Ouija board? She had made one at school and she said if you asked the right questions... you could... learn about the future. And my younger cousin, who was ten, was very, very scared. She didn't want to make the board. And my older cousin told her she could be in trouble if she didn't go along. Because the spirit could enter her body if it found her alone. So finally my younger cousin said yes. And my older cousin got a blank piece of paper and started writing the letters. Can you wait a sec? - What? You'll scare me with this. It's not a real story. - I know, but I mean... I don't find these stories funny at all. Really, I get very upset. Look... you're telling me the story and... look at me. Damn it, Lola, nothing happened. My cousin shat herself and it was over. You see? See what I mean? See what I mean? It's no longer funny because now you know how it ends. C'mon, it's still funny. It's still terribly funny. It's just that... poor girl - She was a pain in the ass. Do you believe in spirits? - No. I'm very skeptical. So you don't believe in spirits but you're scared of horror stories. I don't understand it. It has nothing to do with it. And I don't believe in ghosts. But just because I don't believe in the explanations for the phenomena... doesn't mean I don't believe in the phenomena. See where I'm coming from? Yes, it's interesting. So how can you explain all that stuff? - I can't. That's what scares me. Do you know why? Because if it happened to me I wouldn't think it's my grandma making contact. Nor the Virgin Mary heralding the end of the world. No... I would just think I had gone mad. And... losing my mind... is what frightens me the most. Well, I'm not afraid of anything. When I was a little girl I used to be really frightened of the dark. And I couldn't go to sleep with the lights off. Then one day my mother came into my room and sat beside me. She hugged me and told me: 'We'll just lay here silently. We'll just relax and imagine we melt with darkness. That we are conjoined with darkness. Once you're one with darkness, you'll no longer fear it'. And I suppose that worked out for you. After those words my mother kissed me on the forehead... let the lights off... and left the room. I never saw her again. She abandoned my father and me. I'm sorry. I can't really hold a grudge against her. Juana... can I ask you a question? - Sure. I'm afraid you'll take it the wrong way. I don't want you to think I'm judging you. Because I have doubts about all this. I have doubts about you. You want to know why I'm doing this, Lola? Yes. The big problem that people have is the need to understand it all. They need everything under control or else they become insecure and weak. That's why you're weak, Lola. Because you want to understand things that have no explanation. All this is due to a very simple motive. I've spent all my life trying to follow my mother's advice. I'm going to change the tape. What would you like to hear? Lola, do you love me? Of course I love you. Are you sure? Then why do I have this strange feeling? What feeling? The feeling of being taken for a ride. Don't say that. I really love you and you know it. I really love you. I really love you. That's just it, you know, because... saying 'I really love you' seems to me much less than simply 'I love you'. Don't get upset. We're fine together. Have you ever seen me angry, Lola? I'm not angry. I just have my doubts. - Why doubts? Because of your doubts. I told you I'm fine. I want to do this. It's you I love. But not as much as you love Mar?a, right? What did you say? You don't know Mar?a? The woman of your dreams. The one who would teach you to dance. I thought you didn't know her name. I suddenly recalled her name. Don't you remember? Isn't she your great love? I don't get why you're not still with her. Mar?a's dead. I'm glad. If you ever talk about Mar?a again I swear I'll kill you. Do you understand, crazy bitch? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Lola... forgive me. I'm sorry. Do you love me all the same? Yes. Where is the girl? You don't know who we are. I reckon it's you who doesn't know who I am. Don't do it! Do you know him? Why do you have a gun, Lola? Why are you here? I want to kill Enriqueta. Why? Mar?a was my kid sister. That's a bunch of crap, Joaqu?n. You know what... Belisa's daughter said when they were... Her husband and daughter were here... so when I showed her the new prototype... She said it looked like an abortion. A baby's abortion, that's what she said. Instead of just 'abortion'. How could she not know what an abortion is? I mean if the mother... I mean she has all these pictures of fetuses... I mean... everyone in that family knows what an abortion is. What matters here is that if the girl says it's an abortion... something is wrong. I mean... we're focused on kids and all kids are the same. The board? Mabel, the board are a bunch of ass kissers! Everything there is the law of the land, right? And then they change their mind... and nobody... I mean I can't trust them. But... a little girl... who says it looks like a baby's abortion, well... Well... we have to come up with... I don't know... some other design. What do I... what do I care? Talk to the toy maker, carry out a... Don't get melodramatic, we control the production. We just... call them and put a stop to it... and that's that. Just tell them: No abortions. And that's that, let's shake them up. OK, I have to go now. Sure, sure, we'll talk. You seem to be on edge. Work, you know. Was it a priest? - A priest? No, no. 'No abortions'. If it's your job, then you must be a priest. No, no... They're... dolls that look like abortions. Hi, the usual? - Yeah. Tell me more about those... abortion prototypes. They're not abortion prototypes. They look like abortions. They're not... Are you familiar with the Chorly & Crocket animation series? Yeah, it's every kid's favorite series, right? Well, I'm the creator... And, well, I was arguing with one of the... producers... thing is, another producer's daughter had seen a prototype for a character... and she likened it to an abortion. Funny, isn't it? - Well... So you're the creator. You animate the characters. No, no. I'm the creator. I created the series, the idea... So it's like... I don't know... You design each chapter... No, no. I got some artists together, gave them guidance... about the concept, the basic concept for the series. What's your name? - Arturo, and you? I'm Enriqueta. - Glad to meet you. Your job must be exciting. It's exhausting. But when you realize your work is influencing... the education of thousands of kids... that's simply marvelous. Plus, the money from selling dolls and stuff isn't bad. I've always envied creative people. I don't know... playing an instrument, writing, drawing... I've never been any good at any of that. Fact is... that in normal everyday life... you can start being slightly subversive. I mean... when you cook, when you decorate your home... You can have creative moments. You don't need to paint or draw. You can start introducing creativity. I'd never thought of it that way. It's a nicer way of living. I'd like another beer, but could you serve it in one of those glasses... I'm afraid they're reserved for cocktails. What's that? - It's a Voodoo. What's in it? - Pineapple... It's a secret! I won't give away the ingredients because it's my recipe. Does it include coconut? I'm allergic... Without coconut it's called Titi. Fine, a Titi then. What do you do? You really want to know? - Yes. I'm a witch. - Witch? Nice. You must be loaded. Well... I can't complain. And how do you become a witch? - With an initiation rite. And they give you fifty black cats, a broom, and... Seriously, what do you do? I'm a bank executive. OK.. fine. That's more terrifying than being a witch. Nowadays. And besides being a witch and the bank thing, what else are you into? Well, I really like to cook. Thing is, I only know how to cook a single dish really well. I'm really good, but it's only one. - What dish is that? Paella. My father's from Valencia and he taught me. I love Paella. I don't really like it that much. I learned to do it thanks to my father's efforts, but I don't really enjoy it. How can you not like Paella? I don't really like separating the food, you know, the bones, the mussels... I don't know, the prawns' antennae... Here you go. - It's not the same glass as hers. No, this is a Titi glass. But I asked for a Voodoo without coconut. Voodoo sans coconut is Titi. This is your glass. All right. It's fine. This guy's an idiot. - He's not that bad. I asked for that one, minus the coconut. But not in this ridiculous vessel. Something wrong? Fuck, it's got coconut! This guy's an asshole! Coconut? - It's got coconut! Do you consider him a normal waiter or what? I'm going to complain. I want to make a complaint, see what happens. Let me do it. I know he doesn't fix the drinks. Somebody else got it wrong. Really, let me do it. - Fine. You know them, let's see who did it... I mean, adding coconut... Look, here it is. He could have brought it himself. He's really sorry. He seldom fixes the cocktails. Here you go. Voodoo glass and a Tiki cocktail. Thanks a lot. What's the matter? Are you upset? Yeah... but it's not with you. C'mon, don't be angry. Tell me a joke. I'm no good with jokes. But you seem like a funny guy. Funny guys really turn me on. There's only one thing I really want. I don't care whether you're nice or evil, intelligent or an idiot... or whether you have bad breath. It's all the same to me. The only thing I want is for you to make me laugh. BLOOD We've been listening to the song 'Sleep'. Now it's time for letters from our audience. And we're getting a lot of them. On 'pain': 'Pain is a hole in your chest that won't let you breathe'. 'It's looking for breath and not finding it' 'An emptiness that only finds emptiness'. 'Pain is solitary and bleak'. 'With a companion, it's bearable. In a group, it diminishes'. 'In the middle of the crowd it becomes smaller'. 'In the stadium following the players, problems are just tiny color points'. 'In planet photographs, oceans turn problems tiny'. 'In the galaxy spiral, they become insignificant'. 'Among constellations, astronauts cannot breathe'. 'Surrounded by vacuum and by space's luminous measles'. 'When we look at the sky with tears in our eyes, we become nomadic astronauts'. 'Infinitely trivial and breathless'. 'Later on, it's dawn'. Yes? - Hi. It's me. How are you? - You pretty girl, I'm fine. How are you? - Not that good. What's going on? Remember Juana? - Sure. How could I not? Something wrong with her? - Yes. Something's happened. With her and with another girl who was with her. Both have gone on a trip. When did they leave? Apparently, last night. And the little girl? - She's not here. That's a big problem, Enriqueta. What do we know? - I've got a name. The girl's name. Yes? It's Alba Vega Cisneros. Give me a minute. Yeah? - The girl's back with her mother. Her name's Violeta Vega Cisneros. Single mother. I'll send you the address. I'll be there as soon as I finish tidying up here. Make it fast and return. You have to look for another place. The hotel is no good for us now. How long will it take? - A couple of hours. Is there any bleach? - There should be under the sink. If not, check out the cupboard. - Got it. Call me when you're done. - Okay. Are you done? - Not yet. Has something happened? I have... a name. How did you get it? - Juana's friend left it for me. Then it was related to that girl. - So it seems. Tell me. Elena Espinoza. Give me a minute. I've got everything but nothing rings a bell. Will you go and see her? - Yes. Before or after the girl's mother? - Before. Be really careful. She probably knows more about us than we know about her. If she got Juana then she's nobody's fool. Okay. Get into the kitchen and find out all you can. Have you thought of anything? Crocket, I have to tell you something. What's up, Chorly? Well... I was the one who threw your birthday cake on the floor. It was you? Why did you do it? I didn't want you to celebrate because Balumba the Magician broke my present. Balumba the Magician? He didn't want you to celebrate. That's why he broke my present. Right. I'm really sorry. I should have told you instead of spoiling the cake. I was so sad when I thought of all the time your mother had spent on it. I've baked you another one. Thank you, Chorly. - But you haven't celebrated! And the forest kids haven't come around with your presents. They were very happy and they had set up a surprise concert. It's all right. - They had rehearsed for months... Who is it? Good afternoon. Are you Elena Espinoza? Yes, that's right. I'm from the police. Could I have a word? What is it? I'm Marina Repollez, from the... Domestic Violence Department. Can we talk? What exactly do you want to talk about? A neighbor of yours called and asked us to call on you. I don't get it. Your neighbor thinks you could be a victim of domestic violence. Domestic violence? Look, I don't know who the neighbor is, but she's wrong. So... thank you anyway. Pardon, but... could you tell me what happened to your face? I don't see why, but, anyway, I fell down the stairs. Is your partner at home right now? No, my partner doesn't live here. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I really can't help you. Good bye. You know what's worse than a domestic abuser? A woman who defends him. I'm not defending anyone. If you won't let me in, I have no problem coming around every day. Great! Is that what cops do now? Waste time with people who don't need help? Look. Even if your partner abuses you, I can't force you to report him. So it's... only five minutes. We'll talk and then I'll leave. If you tell me the truth, I'll go as if nothing had happened. Yeah. Thing is, if I let you in, it's like admitting something's wrong. I think you're being inconsiderate to me. Most of all considering that, whether I'm wrong or not... I'm here to help you. And let me tell you one thing: I won't leave until I'm absolutely sure... that you're telling me the truth. Do you have an ID? Of course. OK, let's get this over. - Thank you. Would you like something to drink? - No, thank you. Mind if I make coffee, I just ate. - Not at all. Sure you don't want some? - I'm fine, thanks. I'm all ears. Elena, first of all I'd like to know you a little better. Tell me a little bit about your life. Well... my name's Elena... I was born in Barcelona... I've been living here for three years... What else can I tell you? Elena... how do you see yourself? Are you also a psychologist? Yeah well, it's true. First I became a psychologist and then a cop. Right. Well, I don't know... I'm a normal person... I don't know what to tell you. And I really don't like these tests. No, no... this isn't a test, Elena. I'm just trying to start a conversation with you so I can know you better. That's all. - Perhaps you could be more specific. All right, Elena. Do you... consider yourself... a good person? Well, yeah... I consider myself a good person. I mean, I have my failings like everyone else. But I'm usually nice to people around me. Do you... believe that you behave well towards your partner... and do you think he shares that view? I would say that's correct. As far as I know, there's no reason he would think otherwise. What about your partner? Tell me about him. Julio? Well, he's an art restorer. He's a... quiet man. He really likes reading. He spends Sundays reading the paper. He's a very cultured man. Do you consider... Julio an aggressive person? Julio's a charming man. What about you? - Me? I'm also a charming person. I have no doubts about that, Elena. But what I mean is... If you also consider yourself an aggressive person. I've said I consider myself a good person. That's a different thing. - I disagree. Look, you'd be amazed by the number of people... that are good persons but cannot control their rage. But I know how to control my rage. Look, I don't want to seem distrustful... but you did say that bruise came from falling down the stairs. Yeah... It kind of makes sense because you live on a first floor. Just in case, did anyone see you? Were there any witnesses? The doorwoman, perhaps? - No. I was by myself when it happened. I kind of prefer it that way. It was a very silly fall. What's your opinion regarding women who take justice into their own hands? Well... well look... honestly, I don't think that's right. Not even when their own lives were at stake? I understand you're bored stiff from... listening to so many battered women, saying the same things... I fell down the stairs, I fell in the shower. But there are women who fall down the stairs. Accidents do happen. It's a simple question of probability. I fell down the stairs. Look, Julio and I aren't the perfect couple. It's true, we're not. But he never laid a hand on me. Never! He'd better not! You can come and see us whenever you want. You can come and check for yourself. Because everything will be all right. Fine. I just wanted to talk to you for five minutes, so... I appreciate you letting me in and talking to me. Don't mention it. I understand it must be uncomfortable to have a person come in... and start making insinuations about your relationship. But we have to do it this way... It's our job. I understand. - And it's really nothing personal. One last thing, could I come around... Of course, whenever you want. No need to call beforehand. Okay. Could I use your bathroom for a minute? Sure, it's down the hall to your right. Okay. Thank you. How are things? Not so good right now. What's wrong? A policewoman sneaked into my house and left me unconscious. And I don't know why. Did you tell her anything? No. At least nothing I know of. Know what? I think she just impersonated a policewoman. Do you think she's come to steal from you? I don't think so. There's nothing valuable at home. What could she want from you? That's what really worries me. I don't know. You always get into such trouble. I recall the girls who came because you had slept with one of their boyfriends. Yes, Mom, but you were already dead when that happened. That's true. How are you? Dead. I remember so much about you. I remember these moments. When I would go with you to the hospital. It's funny, because I hated it. But now I remember it with certain affection. That's because they were the only times when we spoke. I don't like that boyfriend of yours. I don't either, honestly. You can't let him hit you. Whatever the reason you can't let him hit you. You have so many weird ideas. If you get out of this, I want you to leave him. Did you hear me? Don't you go patronizing me! - Yes, Mom. Swear by me. - I swear by you. How are your chorizo and beans? Very good. But not as good as yours. And mine weren't as good as your grandmother's. Hi, Elena. I'm sorry about the mess in your house. I was looking for something. The best outcome for you and me... is for you to have done what I think you did. Did you do what I think you did? Anyway, you were never going to tell me right away. Everyone fears physical pain more than they do death. Do you know why? Because we know death is coming to us eventually. It's something that's there. But not physical pain. We spend our whole lives trying to avoid it. Accidents, operations, fractures... We would all like to fall asleep one day... and die in our beds peacefully. Look, what I'm proposing is... comprised of three phases. I'll give you the opportunity to talk. So... I'll take your gag off, I'll ask some questions... and you'll answer them. Easy, right? Now... if you lie to me, or scream, or if you don't cooperate... we'll continue with... the second phase. Everyone talks in the second phase. Well... Elena... I can assure you... Elena? If you make it to the end, I'll believe every word. Everything you say. So well, the third phase... in truth, I never reached the third phase. So then... I really hope... it doesn't come to this, right? Okay... I think we can start. Just be calm, okay? Let's do it. Are you calm? Very good. Let's see... open up... Help! You got off lightly, bitch. DIAMOND SPARKLE How are you? - Fine. I mean, better. I'm in Lucia's house for a few days. You know... I've been thinking a lot. I've been thinking about our relationship. And I think the best thing for us is to call it quits. Definitely. I reached a point where I realized... that I don't need you. I thought I needed you, but it's not like that. Actually, I feel a little guilty. It may sound odd to you... because... I've been using you. I think you've never really known me, Julio. I think you don't really know who I am I think it's you who doesn't know who I am.
