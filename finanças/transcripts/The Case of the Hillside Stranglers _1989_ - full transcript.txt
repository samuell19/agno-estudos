[NARRATOR READING] Be right back. Just be quick, huh? Not to worry. WOMAN: Yes, who is it? It's the police, Miss Wilson. -Hi. -Hi. You remember me? I'm Kenny Bianchi. I used to live next door. How you doing? [LAUGHING] All right. Well, um, I'm with the police reserves and... What do you want? Well, I was patrolling in the neighborhood and I noticed your car. You drive a VW, don't you? That's right. I'm really sorry, but it looks like someone just crashed into it in the parking lot. What? I know. If you'd like to come out, I could write up a report for you. Might help you with insurance. [ALL CLAMORING] MAN: This is the fifth girl. Don't you have any leads? Lieutenant, what do you got? ED: This. Not much different from the other victims. I want you and Hernandez on this now, exclusive. Dear Jesus. ED: Ligature marks at the neck, wrists and ankles. Blood from the rectum. That could've happened after the murder. Small bruises around the breasts. Puncture marks on the inner arms. They height marks? ED: I don't think so. None of the usual needle scars. BOB: You find any footprints? No. He never leaves any. BOB: What about tire tracks? The ground's too hard. All right, can we lose these people? Bob, no sign whatsoever of her being dragged. She looks like she was just kind of placed there. One guy would've just dumped her. Maybe two guys carried her here. Might be right. Let's keep it quiet for now. All right. We've got nothing to go on. Nobody knows anything. The press is making us look like fools, and the public is afraid to walk out at night. That's why we're forming this task force. You men from the sheriff's department in Glendale will work with us at the LAPD. This is a joint venture, not a contest. We work together, understood? ALL: Yeah. Five bodies have been found in a nine-day period, right through Thanksgiving. All of them have been found in this area here. Based on the Wilson murder, we now think it might be two guys. We want this kept quiet for a little while longer. Sergeant Grogan. Well, they, and I'm sure there are two of them, they seem to be bored with the simple rape, strangulation. The mutilation of the victims tells us a little something about their contempt for women, or society. Now, it's unusual for serial killings to be done by two people. The pattern of the crimes is the only link we have between the murders. We have no idea where the crime scene is. Could we just put the girls' pictures up, please? Now, the victims are all different colorings, all different types, they come from all different kinds of backgrounds. Got a hooker, an honors student, a waitress... Now, I think these guys are doing this for kicks. And, somehow, I don't think they're finished. There's gonna be more of them if we don't find them. Lights! Questions? That's it, you have your assignments. ED: Oh yeah, one more thing. We're running this all over town. Ready? I think so. Mr. Wilson, I know it won't help much to hear me say this, but we're gonna nail the animal that did that to your daughter, to those other girls. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure. What kind of man would do a thing like that to a lovely young woman like Margaret? What are you doing here? The sun's not up yet. Wanted to beat the early crowd, otherwise you need police protection to get here. It's angry out there. What are you doing here? I'm two years behind on paperwork. You want one? No. A little early. Since when do you go by the clock, Ed, huh? I don't even know if it's breakfast or dinner anymore. You seem to know the cocktail hour pretty good, Bob. You've been doing a lot of that since this case started. How's the new apartment? Small. Go home. I can't. Kathy won't let me inside the house. That's funny. What is? After all these years together, we have nothing to talk about, me and Kathy. I seem to relate to the families of the victims, why can't I relate to my own family? I try. God knows I try. I hocked my jockstrap to buy a boat. Kathy won't even go on it. She says that boats make her sick. You know, she's been on it once, one time. How many times you been on it? Whose side you on here? Do you wanna go back? I don't know. I don't even think she'd take me back anymore. She might, you know, if I quit, spent more time with her and the family, and got into something else, led a normal life. Wear pajamas. What? Ed, what do you wear when you got to bed? Under shorts. Do you know any cops that wear pajamas? No. She wanted me to wear pajamas. [LAUGHING] What the hell? Pour one. [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLING] BOB: I envy you, Ed. You're as good at your job as anybody I know, but you keep your life in one piece. I envy you, my friend. At ease! Wrong. With this outfit, pearls. I don't think I've seen you around here before. [CHUCKLES] That's 'cause I've never been here before. Where you from? Chino. When did you get out? This morning. Papers? [SIGHING] Well, you picked a hell of a place to start your rehabilitation. Better watch him, he cheats. BOB: You see anything unusual? Every minute of every day. More unusual. Nah. Make sure you walk in packs. Understand me? If I catch any of you working the streets alone, I'm gonna run you in. This week the strangler is picking on nice girls, but you never know. -Huh? -Gotcha. Thanks, Grogan. -Hey, Ang. -How much money you owe me, Kenny? Give me a break. Let's go inside. I am not in the money-lending business, and I work too damn hard for my money to give it to you to blow on some stupid scheme. You understand? -Relax, 'cause I'll pay you back... -Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll get it. Someone owes me money. As soon as they pay me, I'll pay you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Know what that is? -What? Lebistes reticulatus. That so? That one's a Xiphophorus helleri. Gives birth live. You know what we did one night, my third wife and me? What? We woke up my daughter when she was, like, six years old and we let her watch one of them give birth. They shoot 'em out like a rocket. It was good sex education for the kid. Well, you're a hell of a father, Ang. Say, listen, do you have anything in mind for tonight? Maybe. -Let's go out. Let's go scamming. -Take it easy. The last time with that Wilson broad was rushed, you know what I mean? We go too fast, we'll slip up. We can't do every girl in town, you know, eh? Well, but, I'm ready when you are. Okay, we'll cruise. But if we don't find the right one, we forget it. We figure this just wasn't the night. If I say it's no good, it's no good. If I say it's a no-go, we scrub the mission. And don't get impatient. The rule is, is that we come back and do 'em here. Understood? -Understood? -Understood, you're the boss. -You're the captain... The big fish. -Come here. ANGELO: Look, menomi. KENNETH: Everything ready? ANGELO: Everything. KENNETH: What are the wires for? Something new, menomi. You know something, Ang? Even though we're cousins, I like when you call me that. Menomi.Blood brothers. I really like that. Not too close. Wait until she gets on a street that's not too busy, menomi. And then we'll just pull up alongside of her. Real nice and easy. What's the matter, Officer? You've committed a traffic violation, Miss. I think I better get my father. I just live right over here. Please step over to my vehicle. I'd really like to get my father. There'll be no need for that. I'm sure we can wrap this up right away if you just get out of the car. May I see your license, please? Could you get in my car, please? How come? I didn't do anything wrong. We're gonna go down to the police station, Miss. Look, I'd really like to get my parents... [BARKING] Get her in! [GIRL PROTESTING] That's the rules. You're not cops! That house, there's a lady watching. [GIRL SOBBING] Say, "Ah." Me first. Here he comes. -Hiya, gang! -Hi, Dad. Well, let's go! -Hey, kiddos. -Hey, Dad. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, Mom says hello. Like hell she does. Well, she meant to, I guess. [PAGER BEEPING] Don't answer it, Dad, huh? Just don't answer it. Never on Sunday. At least not this Sunday. Come on, to the boat! MARY: Forward! I worked on the engine last week. Oh, wait till you hear it. I'm telling you, it's a beauty. She is running so good right now. [PAGER BEEPING] Don't answer it, Dad. Ah, you know... I better answer it. I told you we'd never reach the dock. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] BOB: There's something on her wrists. -Make sure you check that out. -Right away, sir. BOB: My God. REPORTER: We just need a few omments from you, sir. Just about my daughter's age. [RINGING] WOMAN: Hello? -You the lady on Brill Street with the dog? -What? Are you the lady on Brill Street with the dog? Why, yes. You keep your mouth shut about what you saw last night. If you talk to anybody about it, you're as good as dead, you understand? Operator. Police! And you're sure that you, uh, you saw them clearly? Oh, yes. From that window. Oh, yes. Okay. We're gonna be guarding your house 24 hours a day. So you don't have to worry. These police officers are gonna stay right here. Thank you, Mr. Grogan. Bob, huh? My name's Bob. And thanks for the cookies. You're welcome. Delicious. -Keep your eyes open. -Yes, sir. The window she said she was looking out of is a good 30 feet from the street. But she said she saw the guys force the girl into the car. Now, it's not too well-lit. She's got bad eyesight. But she's certain she could identify the guys and the Sameth girl. Oh, yeah. If her dog was barking outside the house, and she was inside the house, how could she hear the girl screaming? Not easily. So... What do you make of it? I don't think she's telling me everything. I think she heard the dog bark and then went outside to see what the hell was going on. Why didn't she say so? I don't know. Fear, maybe. Shame. She didn't do anything to try to stop it. She doesn't want us to think she was close enough. Oh, she did say one thing. She's sure there was two of them. I think we should make that public. People should be aware of that for their own protection. Okay. I'll take care of it. Anything else? Yeah. She said they were driving a dark car with a light top. At night that could look like a squad car. Now, maybe these guys are running around playing policeman. God. Maybe they are policemen. Ay, ay, ay. Night, Mary. Oh, Miss! Daddy! Hey, all I wanted was directions! Thank you, Daddy. I didn't expect it. What a Christmas present. I don't you walking the streets. That's why you're getting the car, kiddo. Too many girls have been killed by these maniacs. That's why I'm giving it to you. Hmm? I want you to keep the windows rolled up and the doors locked, I don't want you to open for anybody, understand? Sure. You don't mind if I enjoy it at the same time, do you? [LAUGHING] Of course not. Enjoy it. -Let's get these papers signed. -Yeah. All right! -Daddy? -Yeah. Are you ever coming home? I don't know, kiddo. I don't know. The city council, the county board of supervisors, TV stations, and an anonymous Glendale lawyer have contributed $100,000 in reward money... -Hi, Ang. -Shh. A statement was issued today by Chief Daryl Gates of the LAPD. The evidence has been meager. We have used resources that we have available to us, the sheriff, Glendale, the state, federal government, and we simply have not been successful. REPORTER: There's no question that Los Angeles is a city of concern. People are frightened. Classes in self-defense are packed. The sale of guns and mace is at an all-time high. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GUNSHOT] It is a city in a state of terror, not knowing where the Hillside Strangler will strike next. Celebrities. What do you wanna do, go on the Carson show? -Uh... -I know you, Kenny, you wanna advertise. [STUTTERS] Look, nobody is going to catch us, Ang. You keep you big mouth shut or we stop. Mouth shut, not a word, menomi. You gotta play it cool, Kenny. You know what I told my daughter when I went to visit her? I told her not to hitchhike, I told her not to walk the streets alone at night. I told her to watch out for the strangler guy, that he was probably some weirdo that escaped from some institution. You gotta play it cool, Kenny. Well, you don't have to worry about me. We going out tonight? -Yeah. -Fantastic. I got a new scam in mind. You know that Chinese girl I've been going out with? Yeah? I think I'm gonna marry her. She's a nice kid. -You mustard or ketchup? -Mustard. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yeah, Grogan. We got a 187. Nude female dumped. My God, another one. [MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO] KENNETH: We get the best of it, Ang. Your customers get the new upholstery, but you get drive their car. I should have never, never let you talk me into this. We deserve this. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] KENNETH: We deserve that, too. ANGELO: What too? KENNETH: That too. I think she needs some company, Ang. It's daylight, stupid. So what? Let's get her. What have we got to be afraid of? Okay, menomi. Hiya, Miss. You talk to her, Ang, you're the loverboy. Hey, girlie. You want to go to a party in Hollywood? Come on, will ya? Party? Hollywood? What do you say? Come on. Just stay away from me, all right? Oh, yeah. Go get her, Ang. Come on. Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, leave her alone! [SCREAMING] Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! God'll get you for this! Get out of here! What are you doing, anyway? God'll get you... God'll get you for this! Are you all right? I think so. -Did you know those men? -No. Just calm down. -I gotta go. -No, no... -Thank you. -Wait. What's your name? Wait! By the way, do you remember that psychic from Germany who wanted you to send him the fare so he could come over and solve the case? -Yeah. -He's here. Paid his own way. -You're kidding me. -He's been waiting three hours. He won't go until you see him. -That's him? -That's him. Bring him in. Doctor? This is Dr. Franz. Sergeant Grogan. What can I do for you, Doctor Franz? [SPEAKING GERMAN] He doesn't speak English. I know a little German, maybe I can translate for him. Go ahead, Doctor. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Something like, he's going to San Diego to visit some family, but had to stop off so he could solve the case for you. Well... Tell him I'm grateful. [SPEAKING GERMAN] He says he's been receiving strong... Strong... [SPEAKING GERMAN] Psychic vibrations about the strangler case. What's he doing? He wrote that the stranglers are two brothers, two brothers, two Italian brothers. [SPEAKING GERMAN] And he wants you to pursue this theory since he's seldom wrong. Get him the hell out of here. Okay, Doctor, that's it. [SPEAKING GERMAN] And keep him the hell out of here. Yeah, I'll let you know. Look, I'll get back to you. Captain Anderson wants you to look at this, Sergeant. Personally. Who's J.D. Jackson? Associate warden at the community treatment center. BOB: Your name's J.D. Jackson. You say that two men stopped you on Figueroa Street? That's right. Now, what time was that? 11:00, at night. And what happened? One of them flashed a badge at me and motioned for me to pull over as they came up along side my car. And then what? They told me to get into their car. I refused. They said they would call a black and white, but they didn't have a radio. I mean, stuff that didn't match. Go on. When I asked for their badge numbers they got really angry, even abusive. So, I started to cry and play, "Oh, please don't hurt me, sir. Please don't hurt me." I attracted so much attention, I guess they let me go. And when I got home, then I really broke down. What made you call the task force? I realized that these guys could be the Hillside Stranglers. I mean, from everything that I've read and heard, their methods checked out. I mean, the place was right, the time of night, the car, everything was right, so I called. Good. You're for real. Come on, I'll walk you to your car. Well, it's three miles away. It's being repaired. How did you get here? Did you hitchhike? A cab. Is this part of the official investigation? If you could just handle one more question. Just about. Why did these two guys stop you? I was going 80 miles an hour on Figueroa Street. Why were you going 80 miles an hour? I'd just broken up with my boyfriend. Why? [MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX] [CHUCKLES] No, I was a real child of the '60s. I spent more time throwing throwing bricks at the Roxy building than I did studying when I was in college. -Oh, come on. -No, I was. How did you get to be the warden of a halfway house? Oh, I think you look at life differently at that age than when you're... At the age that I'm at now. I had no sense of needing security, no sense of having an old age, which is rapidly approaching. -Can't tell from here. -It's the light. Well, or the lack of it. Anyway, um, one day I just found myself interested in human services. Hurt your pitching arm, huh? And ran out of bricks. [CHUCKLES] You've been married? Once. Disaster. What about you? And yours? I think I just got to the point where I needed more than just a mother for my children. Or maybe it just took me a little longer to grow up. Takes a lot of years, you know. It did me. Yeah, we got married when we were young. Grew up together in Boston. Just kids. We were too young. What are you missing? I'm not sure. But I'll know when I find it. It's late. Oh, yeah. I'll take you home. There you go. This place is kind of weird. Why? Everybody in here looks like a cop. Everybody in here is a cop. This is where we do our best work. Goodnight, Bob. Thanks. Oh, uh, how about a cup of coffee? -Sorry. -Well, I just thought that, uh... Don't push it, Grogan. Whatever you're missing, you won't find it here. Not tonight, anyway. [KNOCKING] -Mr. Bianchi? -Yes, sir. -Kenneth Bianchi? -That's my name. Okay if I come in? Sure. Thank you, sir. Sit down. Mind if I ask you some questions, Mr. Bianchi? Certainly not. I hope nothing is wrong. Have you been dating a girl named Sheryl Allison? Yes, I have. Has anything happened to Sheryl? No, no. Ms. Allison's mother filed a complaint. She said that you borrowed money from her daughter. Is that a crime? No, sir, it isn't. [SIGHS] We're investigating the hillside stranglings, and she couldn't exactly say why, but, I don't know, she thought it might be a good idea to talk to you. Well, you have no reason to be embarrassed. You have a job to do, too, right? I'll be more than happy to answer any questions you have. Thanks. How come the cops have been to see you and they ain't been to see me? Some chick's idiot mother. Listen, I was cool, man! I'm going to tell you something. You stay away from me. You understand? Stay away. What do you mean, stay away? When are we going out again? When I say so. Now you go cool off for a couple months. I'll tell you when to come back. -Were you out today? -Yeah, I was. -What did you get? -Nothing. Followed up six leads, got one completed. Spoke to a guy named Bianchi. Here's his file. What's a Bianchi? Just a guy. I checked him out. Got a copy of his driver's license and a photostat of his application to the hospital. He studied at Columbia, New York, in psychology. Clean. No prior record. File it. KENNETH: No, I must say, this is really exciting. It's fabulous, the idea that any citizen can ride along, in a police car, is, uh, special. [LAUGHS] Well, it gives people a first-hand close-up of what we do everyday. You'd be surprised how many people have a misconception of what our jobs are. I'll bet. Yeah, I'll bet! You know something? I've always wanted to be a policeman. Is that so? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Watch your leg. Say, will we be driving near any of the sites where the hillside strangler bodies were found? Oh, that's not my beat, so I don't know the actual locations. Right, right, Sergeant. Just as well. It's a little too gruesome for me. -Hey, Bob. -Yeah? We got the two guys who stopped the Jackson woman. You what? How? They just walked in and surrendered. Come on in. Boys. You two? BOB: They weren't the hillside stranglers. J.D.: What? BOB: They were just a couple of vice cops. They got drunk, after duty, and they were looking for a little action. J.D.: Well, what do you have on the case so far? BOB: There's an old saying in homicide. "You crawl into a victim's shoes, you'll find the murderer." Well, we did that. And we found nothing. I mean, the victims aren't killed where the bodies are dumped, so there's no murder scene. All the leads are phony. And then suddenly, two months ago, the killings stopped. [SCOFFS] We're guys who are used to the hunt. I mean, we're used to finding our prey. You know what it does to you? I'm beginning to find out. We got Margaret Wilson and Helen Tobin. They live across the street from each other, but they don't know each other. Now, that means that the killers either live or work in Glendale. Which explains why they're familiar with the area and why the dump sites are so remote. Right, yeah. Hernandez found a little piece of fluff on Melinda Walker's eyelid. Now, he had it examined. But it's just polyester fiber, origin unknown So that led us nowhere. Lab's still working on that. Phillipa Sameth, she had marks in the palms of her hands, electrical burns. Now, that indicates that she was tortured. And Margaret Wilson, puncture marks in the arm. Also torture. She wasn't doing drugs. And just a lot more, you know, trivia like that. And we got no witnesses, except one woman. Betty Atkins, I'm telling you, she's a case. She saw one of the victims abducted, then later, one of the stranglers called and threatened her. Well, I've been to see her, what, maybe 30 times? I never ate so many cookies in my life. Now, she says that she was inside when she saw it. I don't believe it. I'm trying to get her to admit that she was outside and a whole lot closer. So, we tried to put her under hypnosis. But every time she almost gets under, she has an asthma attack. Which you're going to have if I don't stop talking and get the hell out of here. I'm a very good listener. Yeah, yeah, you are. You're a hell of a good listener. I,,, I'm afraid I don't get to unload like this too often. Anytime, Grogan. Thanks. Well. Gotta go. Oh. -You... You like jazz, huh? -Mm-hmm. Me too. I love it. Do you like Stan Getz? -You bet. -Huh. -Woody Herman? -Woody Herman is the best. I love Woody Herman. Woody Herman's my favorite. [SIGHS] I'd like to see you again. Okay. When? Now. I better tell you something. What? I don't wear pajamas. That's okay. Neither do I. Marsha, believe me. I've been a psychologist long enough to know that your husband has been working too hard, under stress, to provide for the new baby. You think so, really? Sure. It's not your fault any more than it is his. Now, if you can afford it, get a babysitter, take a long weekend, just the two of you. It'll be like a second honeymoon, if you will. -Trust me. -Thank you, Dr. McIntyre. Sure, anytime. [DIALING PHONE] Angelo? Hi, Ang. I told you never to come around here. Come on. It's been two months since I've seen you. I miss you. Menomi,remember? Okay, so what? You don't even invite me to your wedding? I don't know. I really missed you, Ang. -You're broke, huh? -Mmm-hmm. Lost your job again? Yeah. Can't take some of the crap these guys hand out. You can never hold on to anything, Kenny. You have no sense of responsibility. Responsible? Did I tell you I've gone back to my psychology practice? Remember those transcripts and diplomas I scammed from that guy? -What guy? -The guy from Cal State, Ed McIntyre. -Remember him? -You should be your own first customer. I get bored, Ang. I need some excitement. I need some stimulation. I miss our old action. [SIGHS] Do you know what I did yesterday? I went on a ride-along. A what? A ride-along, in a police car. Honest. I had nothing to do, so I registered, and they took me. Sergeant Thorpe drove. He was a nice guy. Then I asked him to show me some of the dump spots where the hillside strangler dumped their bodies, but he said that was up to homic... -[GUN COCKING] -Hello? Don't do that. You crazy idiot. Look, I was only kidding, okay? You're looking for kicks, huh? Publicity? The cops don't come to you, you go to the cops? What else did you tell them? What else! I didn't say anything to anybody. It's over, Kenny. You're leaving. No more scamming. Why don't you just put that down, okay, Ang? I mean, I'm your cousin, okay. It's Kenny. I mean, we're part... We're in this thing together! We're in nothing together! We're in nothing. You're leaving, Kenny, before you do something to blow this whole deal. We quit while we're ahead. You're leaving, Kenny, do you understand? -Go where? I've got no place to go. -What was that town up north? -What town? -Don't you have some ex-girlfriend from Washington someplace? What, Bellingham? That town is from no place. That's jerkwater time, Ang. It rains everyday. You're going, Kenny, to Bellingham, and you're going to stay. If you don't go, or if you come back, I swear to God I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Kenny. Kill me? Kill me? Nobody talks to Kenny Bianchi that way, nobody! Where is everybody? What is this, St. Paddy's Day? We're shutting it down, Bob. You're what? Orders. We have other cases, and this one's taking us nowhere. We work with a skeleton crew. -Hey, you can't do that... -Orders, Bob. We haven't had any new bodies in almost a year. We're shutting it down. -Could you fill it up, please? -Be right with you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Louise? Hiya. It's Kenny. Kenny Bianchi. I was working at the hardware store when we met last. Yeah, right. How are you, Kenny? Uh, miserable. Oh, what's wrong? It's a lousy, boring town, Louise. There's no action, you know? I've been here, like, eight months and there's no action. One good thing is I won't grow old here. I'll die of boredom at a young age. You know? What are you doing? Uh, I'm looking for work. Well, if you're broke, I can lend you some. I can afford it. I'm captain of security at Everfast. Here's my badge. My van's to my left. What do you need? Oh, that's real nice of you, Kenny, but no thanks. I don't know you well enough for that. But thanks, anyway. You're a real nice guy. I... [CHUCKLES] Louise, uh, we're installing a new security system at the Van Adam house on Shoreline Drive. On Thursday night the house will regrettably be without a security system and... I was wondering if you'd like to housesit. You'd be doing me a big favor, and it would be $100 for you. Aren't you sweet, Kenny. That... That would be terrific. 9:00 at the house. You can drive right up to the door, and I'll see you then. Okay, great! Hi, Kenny. Hiya. This is my roommate Nikki Ross. This is Kenny Bianchi. Hey, Nikki Ross. What are you doing here? She's just company. That's okay, isn't it? That's okay. I wasn't expecting anybody else, but let's... Let's go inside. [LOCKING] I'll try this one. Everything okay? Well, it looks like they turned off the lights. Better go down to the basement and check the fuses. Louise, if you're going to housesit, you're going to have to know your way around, won't you? -Okay, let's go. -Sure. -Not afraid of the dark, are we? -No. Good girl. We'll be right back. The fuse box is right over there. I really can't see very much, Kenny. Yeah, well, let me fix that for you. Louise? We're having trouble finding the fuse box. Well, what's taking you guys so long? Uh, why don't you come on down? Maybe you can help. Louise? Kenny? Louise? [GASPS] I don't need you, Angelo. I don't need you anymore. Gentlemen. Are you Kenneth Bianchi? Yes, sir, I am. How may I help you, Officer? You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] BOB: It isn't easy for either one of us, your mother or me. But it just made sense to realize, to admit, that I'm not coming home. But most important of all, I want you to know that it has nothing to do with you. I know that sometimes kids blame themselves for what happens between their parents. Now, I don't want you to do that, all right? You've met someone. Well, that's part of it, yeah. What's her name? J.D. Those are initials. It's her name. But I want you to know, she didn't have anything to do with my leaving the house. What did? Well, it all started to happen years ago. Now... [PAGER BEEPING] -Just don't answer it. -I won't. Look, this is the way I want us to be. I... [PAGER BEEPING] I'm sorry, kids. I gotta call in, okay? Phone? It's around the corner. Yeah, hang on. I've got lots more to say. Okay? Grogan. Sheriff's Department just called. We might have a break in the case. I'll be right there. The bodies of Nikki Ross and Louise Sojick were discovered earlier this morning in Bellingham, Washington. They were strangled, sexually molested and dumped. -Who were they? -Two local girls. Sojick told her boyfriend about a housesitting job. It was arranged by a security guard named Kenneth Bianchi. Bianchi? Hmm. Why does the name sound familiar to me? When Bellingham police searched his apartment they turned up masses of stolen goods. That made the job easier. They were able to book him for grand theft. That way they could hold him. Well, why did they call us? He's got a California driver's license. They called a check on his background. His address is listed as 908 West Spring Lane. Hey, that's the building next to Eunice Wakefield. And across the street from Margaret Wilson. -Right. -Right. Bianchi. You know, I'm sure that one of our officers investigated a guy named Kenneth Bianchi months ago. Yeah, here it is. Kenneth Bianchi. Gave as his character reference a guy named Angelo Buono. Some upholster on Colorado Street in Glendale. It's his cousin. Buono? Buono. Buono. Bianchi. My God. What? That German psychic, he said we should look for two Italian brothers. You've got to be kidding me. I don't believe this. -Angelo Buono? -Yeah, right. What can I do for you? We'd like to talk to you. Talk about what? Kenny Bianchi. You know Kenny Bianchi? Yeah, sure I know him. Is he a relative? Yeah, he's a cousin of mine. Why? What did he do? He's accused of killing a couple of girls up in Washington. Don't surprise me, man. How's that? Now, Kenny's a little cuckoo. That right? You've heard about the hillside stranglings, haven't you? I read the newspapers. Angelo, do you own a police badge? [SCOFFS] What would I be doing with a police badge? How about Kenny, does he have one? Yeah, he had something, some kind of badge. Got it at a swap meet someplace. They're easy to get, you know? Oh. Old Kenny. He liked to be different people. Really? What do you mean by different people? Well, like, one time he rented an office space from a doctor. Made off like he was one of them head shrinks. Psychologist. ANGELO: Yeah, right, something like that. How did he get away with that? He hung phony certificates on the wall with other guys' names. Moved in just before he went up north, he used the name of... McIntyre. Ted McIntyre. Angelo, I've got something here I want to show you. These are pictures of the girls that were murdered down here. I'd like you to take a look at them. Look at them. All of them. Did you ever know any of these girls? I've seen their pictures on television. Never met any of them? No, never. Angelo, did Kenny have any weird sexual hang-ups you knew about? Well, who knows what's going on in a guy's mind, right? We've all got funny things. Yeah, how about you, Angelo? You got funny things, too, huh? I hear you like to be called the Italian stallion. Is that right? Look, I've been pretty patient with you two guys up until now, but you're violating my civil rights, and I don't like it. And I'm going to tell you something... No, I'm going to tell you something. Deep down inside, I think you're yellow as fresh manure. You're trying to put this all off on Kenny Bianchi, but you were with him all the way. And when we can prove that, we're going to come back here, and when we leave, you're going to come with us. Do you understand what I'm saying? ON TELEVISION: Dr. Shannon Baxter, welcome to the morning show. DR. BAXTER: Thank you for inviting me. I think people are going to be particularly fascinated by your non-fiction work on the abnormal mind. You have a section in here that I find utterly fascinating, about the multiple personality. I mean, you literally are saying, in fact, there is that which we hear about so frequently in fiction, the person who is, on the one hand, Dr. Jekyll, and the next moment, Mr. Hyde. It is a rare condition, but I have seen cases where the patient is split into several different and distinct multiple personalities, neither personality remembering what the other has done or said. BOB: His attorney thinks he's what? A multiple personality. He's a multiple killer, that's what he is. -You know what he's going for, don't you? -Insanity plea. They're bringing in some big-shot psychiatrist to hypnotize him. But if he does go under hypnosis, he could implicate Buono. Mike and I should go to Bellingham. Do you know much about hypnosis? Not much. I read a pamphlet once. But this will be a new experience for me. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. I think everything will be just fine. I trust you, Doctor. Now, just take a few deep breaths. And watch the pendulum as it swings from side to side. Feel heavy? Close your eyes. Feel heavy. And relax every part of your body. Now, I think there's a part of Ken that I haven't talked to yet. On the count of three, I'd like to communicate with that part. One... Two... Three. Thank you, Part. You may open your eyes. Part, are you the same thing as Ken or are you different in any way? I'm not him. I'm not Ken. Who are you? Do you have a name? I've got a name for him. Ted. You can call me Ted. Ted. I hate him. I hate Ken. Why do you hate Ken, Ted? Because he tries to be nice. I hate a lot of people. But I fixed Ken when he came to California. I fixed him good. How do you mean? How'd you do that? He walked in on his cousin Angelo. Hello... Angelo was in the middle of killing this girl, and Ken walks in, and I make him feel like he's part of it. See, I make him feel like there's nothing wrong with killing people because it's like getting back at his mother. Did Ken kill some of these girls? Yeah, but I made him do it. He couldn't figure out later what he did or why, he couldn't come up with it, because I wouldn't let him remember. I made him kill all those women. I made him strangle all those ladies. I even made him strangle those two girls here in Washington. Now, where did these killings take place? Angelo's house. Angelo and Ken would take turns strangling the girls. Do you have a last name, Ted? McIntyre. DR. WATTS: All right. I'm going to count from one to five. At that time you will awaken, completely refreshed and relaxed, totally alert. One... Two... Three... Four... Five. [CHUCKLING] He was no more hypnotized than I am. Well, at least he fingered Buono. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hernandez. Ready for some bad news? Yeah. Are you kidding me? Okay. I'll tell him. Henderson. Bianchi's performance was greater than you think. We're in big trouble. The shrink bought his act. What? They've notified the court that they'll enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Those lousy shrinks. Some crazy jury's gonna turn him loose. Because his mother was mean to him. If they buy that Kenny's a nut case, we won't even be able to touch Buono. -McIntyre... -He'll do a couple years in a mental hospital -and they'll let him go. -McIntyre. In two years we'll have to look for this son of a bitch... Hold it. McIntyre. McIntyre! What are you talking, "McIntyre"? -It's been driving me crazy since Bianchi said it. -Why? Buono said it first. Ted McIntyre. What? McIntyre what? The diplomas. -The phony diplomas. -The phony diplomas. He just might have made the mistake of giving his other personality a real person's name. Let's go get a second opinion. DR. OWENS: You're feeling pretty relaxed and deeply, deeply asleep. Now, Mr. Bianchi, I'm going to make this circle on your hand, and when I touch you outside this circle, you will feel pressure, and you will say, "Yes." When I touch you inside the circle, you will feel nothing and say, "No." Outside the circle you will feel pressure and say, "Yes." Inside the circle you will feel nothing and say, "No." Are you ready? I am. Yes. Yes. All right, Mr. Bianchi. You can open your eyes. Now, I want you to imagine your lawyer, Mr. Jason Byrnes, sitting in that chair to you left. Hello, Mr. Byrnes. How are you? I'd like to thank you for all the help you've been giving me on the case. You see him there? KENNETH: Yes, sir, I do, indeed. Why, don't you, Doctor? Should I? Well, if I see him, he's there, isn't he? Mr. Bianchi, do you see your lawyer, Mr. Jason Byrnes, sitting in the chair to your right? KENNETH: How could Jason be sitting in two places at once? He's right where you told me he was. May I touch you, sir? See, I feel him. He's right here. -Well, what do you think? -It's obvious. When I touched his hand inside the circle, he said nothing. He thought he outsmarted me but he demonstrated that he was fully awake. You see, a truly hypnotized individual would have said, "No," as I instructed. What happened with that lawyer thing? Bianchi tried to prove he was experiencing his hallucinations. He was not. You see, a truly hypnotized individual does not interact physically with a hallucination. Gentlemen, he's a fake. Well, Kenny... You're getting to be pretty famous. How was your session with Dr. Owens? All right, I guess. You don't remember much when you're hypnotized. Well, he says, to use a police term, you're full of crap. Come on, Kenny. You were no more hypnotized than you're a multiple. This is Richard Carson, Kenny. He's the Deputy DA for Los Angeles. Mr. Bianchi. I've been authorized to offer you a deal. A deal? Basically, it's this. If you plead guilty to the Washington murders, and the hillside stranglings, you'll be given a life sentence with the possibility of parole, instead of the death penalty. You can serve your time in California. Walla Walla State Prison here in Washington is the toughest in the country, if you're not aware of that. And in return, you must testify fully and truthfully about Angelo Buono. Okay. So, who came up with the idea of how to kill the girls? He was the one who first came up with the idea of murder. Did Buono ever say what his motivation was? No. We never discussed anything like that. I just can't get it through my head that Buono was the organizer and you were the follower. I think it best not to short-change Angelo Buono. He's very streetwise and he can come off any way he wants to. You know, it's a funny thing, I was thinking, Kenny. You and me, we've got a lot in common, you know? Two Catholic kids from the east, huh? Catholic schools. "Do this, don't do this." Right? Right. I meet up with a bunch of cops, you meet up with a guy like Buono. What happened? I don't know. "Do this, don't do this." And all of the sudden you can do whatever the hell you want. And you gave in. Then, pretty soon, what do you know, here you are. So are you. Yeah, but I'm walking out of here and you're not. No credit to you, sir. [CLEARS THROAT] What does that mean? What that means, big city cop, is that you've been chasing us for, what, two years now? And it took some jerkwater force to finally crack the case. Now, what I want to know is how that makes you feel? It doesn't matter who caught you. I think it does. I think it matters to you, sir. You are evil, Kenny. You're as evil as they come. And it galls me to have to spare your life. The only reason we're going through all this is so we can put you and Angelo away. Do you understand that? Yes. Now I want some straight answers from you. We're gonna start with the first girl. J.D.: Okay, now that you've gotten Bianchi's confession, what are you going to do about Buono? We just put him under 24-hour surveillance. What... What motivates a guy like that? Oh, I've seen lots of guys like him pass through this town. Nothing unusual about him. During the day he's a hard working guy, at night he kills women. Very funny. What I don't understand is the women we interviewed. They find him attractive. Ugly-attractive. Sexy. Animal-like. Can you believe that? It's fascinating. BOB: My God. HERNANDEZ: What's the matter? Am I going crazy? Take a look at this. Who is this? It's J.D. What the hell is she doing here? You're asking me? What the hell is she... You're gonna blow our cover. Just keep an eye on her, okay? Hello. Hi. Can I help you? I... I think I need new carpeting. You think? Well, I mean, it's all spotted. Why don't you let me take a look? -You from the neighborhood? -Uh, more or less. What I mean is, who sent you? [STAMMERING] I found your card in my purse. -Someone must have recommended you. -Oh, really? Who? I don't remember. Well, whoever it was knows quality. I give you nothing but the finest. I'm sure. You know, some people may think I'm out of my mind for doing this, but you really don't need new carpets. I got some special cleaner that'll make it look like brand new. -Okay. -I got it inside. Come on. Come on. Two minutes. If she's not out in two minutes... Come on. Guaranteed to work or your money back. Thanks. I was just about to close. Will you do me a favor? What? Business has been kind of lousy. Can you tell your friends? Maybe even dirty their cars? [CHUCKLES] That was a joke. [CHUCKLING] Thanks. Hey. Ten bucks? Are you crazy? What in the hell possessed you to do such a stupid thing? I had to see for myself. I had to see what he was like. I was okay until he asked me to follow him into the shop, and you knew that I knew you were there. [STIFLED SOB] God, I'm an idiot. No argument. But I've never been in love with an idiot before. Thanks. Oh, Grogan... He was so... Normal. If I didn't know... You know. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I would have bought his act. Hello? MAN: Is Grogan around? Yes, he's here. Yes. Henderson feels we've got all the evidence we're gonna get on Buono. Okay. I'm picking him up. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [REPORTERS CLAMORING] I told you we'd come back and get you, you scumball. Get in. We've searched everywhere for the Excalibur, Mrs. Smith. It can't be found. Are you sure you... I know what I saw. They were the men, and that was the car. I reported this two years ago, but nobody listened to me. And when I saw their picture on TV, I knew I better get in touch with you again. I see. Can I go home now? Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. Thank you very much. We'll be in touch. There's no evidence to corroborate her testimony. We can't locate the girl. I think she's fantasizing. She identified them from the photos. Means nothing. Oh, yes. I still remember what they looked like. You recognize Mr. Buono as one of the men you saw that night, even though it's been almost three years since the killing? I do. You were at the window? That's right, sir. Miss Atkins, are you sure you weren't outside, hmm? Closer to the car? I was at the window. Now... We're going to go outside to the same spot you said they were, all right? All right. Now, would you please take your place at the window just how you were that night. This the spot? Just about. Are you telling me she saw two men she could recognize, from that window, at night? I can hardly see her, it's so dark. And how could she see over all that shrubbery? The shrubbery's grown. It's been three years. There's no way that woman saw what they look like. You expect me to believe that? You expect a jury to believe that? It's ridiculous. They won't believe anything unless you give 'em a chance. What's the matter? Afraid you'll lose this case? You don't have a case. That woman had no idea what she saw. Her story would be destroyed in cross-examination. [SIGHING] We're gonna have to throw this count out. You moron. What are you trying to do? We've got evidence, the fiber on that girl's wrist is what Buono uses for upholstery. Another girl had fluff on her eyelids that also came from Angelo's shop. Bianchi's in LA right now, ready to testify. What the hell more do you want? I need hard evidence, Grogan. I need witnesses, Grogan. I'm a prosecutor. I have a duty to perform. I can't win a case without evidence. This case is not winnable. [SIGHING] Get in line. You wanna work out? With the weights? Gotta get outside some time, Buono, or your whole body gets rubbery. My whole body ain't gonna be here long enough. Yeah? You got an uncle on the jury? Better than that. I got a cousin who's going into his nut bag. You got a what? Cousin. Who's going into what? His nut bag. The truth, sir, is I have absolutely no recollection of faking being hypnotized. I probably faked being a multiple personality, but... Are you saying you gave false testimony when we interviewed you in Washington? Well, sir... When I told the psychiatrist about committing those murders with Angelo, I'm not sure if I was telling the truth or not. I was probably lying when I confessed. I was probably not even there during the crimes. Or maybe I was. I... But not in Bellingham. Your Honor, it is the belief of the Los Angeles District Attorney office that the person, Kenneth Bianchi, whose continued credibility is essential to the successful prosecution of the murder charges against Mr. Angelo Buono, has lost such credibility. The murder charges now pending against Mr. Buono cannot be predicated on the evidence. And the case should be dismissed. JUDGE: I will take the matter under submission. The course is adjourned until Tuesday, July 21. I will rule on the motion at that time. [BANGS GAVEL] How are you, Sergeant? -Getting by, Kenny. -Glad for you, sir. -Looks like you pulled it off. -Sir? Well, they're betting fifty-to-one there'll be no trial. Big odds, sir. Yeah, real big. Let me ask you something, Kenny. Why? I mean, Angelo put you away, he's helping keep you here, so why did you do that for him? Him... No. Not him, Sergeant. You know what it's like having a canine jacket strapped to your back in a place like this. Being pegged as an informer? Sergeant, that is certain death. Now come on. Now, I've got a chance to be declared insane based on inconsistent statements, which means maybe I'll spend some time in a psychiatric hospital, or maybe I'll just get out sooner or later. That's not the way it's gonna happen, Kenny. None of it. You see, your plea bargain is only good if you testify honestly against Angelo. I did. Judge George thinks you broke your promise. So you know what's gonna happen to you? You're gonna go back to Washington. You're gonna serve your time in Walla Walla, the toughest prison in this country. Angelo might go free again because of you. But you're never gonna get out of there. Never. We're going home. -The party is over. We're going home. -[MUMBLING GIBBERISH] While Mr. Angelo Buono walks the streets? You put Bianchi away. You should be celebrating that. Angelo Buono, a free man. Why don't we just wait until the judge rules, hmm? Explain it to her, will you? Look, the judge always grants the wishes of the prosecution. [SLURRING] "Judge, I wanna dismiss the case," and it's... They figure it makes no sense to order the prosecution to proceed on a case it says it can't win. -Can you believe it? -I can believe it. Let's believe it outside. Shall I get the car or call an ambulance for you guys? Buono's gonna be walking the streets again. -Hey! -Grogan! [GUN FIRING] Can you believe it? He's gonna be walking the streets again. All the years on this lousy case... Down the drain. Be seated. This court finds the dismissal of murder charges pending against defendant Angelo Buono is not in the furtherance of justice, and the District Attorney's motion to dismiss those charges is hereby denied. If the county will not prosecute, the office of the State Attorney General has agreed to do so. There will be a trial. No one from the press. Not within 50 yards, you understand? BOB: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, of the 10 young women who were murdered, these two were the youngest. Marti Jones was 12 years old. Lisa Corbin, she was 14. Both of them were schoolgirls. Both of their bodies were dumped on this trash heap below us, here, on November 13, 1977. They were raped, they were sodomized, they were tortured and they were strangled, just like all the others. You can see how obscure this place is. Only someone who has lived in this area for a long time would know about it, or could find it quickly, especially in the dark. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] BOB: Please keep your attention on the helicopter above us. It'll be turning its spotlight on certain locations for us, and each instance you'll be told what that location is. That's where Phillipa Sameth's body was discovered, on November 28, 1977. Phillipa was 22. Below us and to the north, is the Golden State Freeway off-ramp where Shelly Haven's body was discovered on November 9, 1977. It's not too far from where Mr. Buono grew up. On November 19, 1977, Margaret Wilson was killed and dumped on that site. Margaret Wilson was 20. She was an art student. BAILIFF: All rise. The Honorable Judge Ronald George presiding. Be seated. Bring in the jury. The foreman of the jury has signaled that the jury has reached a verdict, and I would enquire if that is the case, Mr. Delano. Yes, it is, Your Honor. JUDGE: Please hand the form to the bailiff. The clerk will now read the verdict. "We, the jury, having found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, "hereby determine the penalty to be life imprisonment "without parole." [ALL CHEERING] Quiet, please! Congratulations. We celebrate, gentlemen. Let's go celebrate. [CHUCKLING] I gotta call J.D. Huh? [RINGING] -MARY: Hello? -Mary. Mary, hi, kiddo. Dad? I wanted to tell you that, uh... They convicted the guy. -Yeah? -Yeah, so now we... We got the both of them. Really? I, uh... I just wanted to... I wanted you kids to know that. I still love you, Daddy.
