When You Grow Up, Dear Adam was shot in 1965, damaged in 1966, and then banned. This attempt at reconstruction dates to 1990. - Fade out motor noise - Light is transparent to light. So all is within it and equally all things in every other. That's why everything is everywhere, each is all, and every individual entirety an immeasurable illumination. Yonder all things are truth. They don't think the right thing, then the wrong one. The right thought is always in their minds, which are untroubled by suffering, always peaceful and pure. They know all things, but not human things. To them truth is mother and wet nurse, being and nourishment. Everything there ts transparent, there ts no darkness, no resistance, and all and everyone is visible through and through to all others. A-ha, yonder means there. Elsewhere, not here, where I cannot be since I'm here. WHEN YOU GROW UP, DEAR ADAM CAST: This is Adam, the young hero of our story. He'll be 18... in 9 years. He's played by Steffen Janicke. Gerry Wolf plays his father, Sept Tember. One director, Wolfgang Grease. Another, Hans Anselm Perten. Not a director, Manfred Krug. Playing a pastor. The pastor's wife is Marita Béhme. Rolf Rémer and Cuban Daisy Granadoz charm us as a couple who high-spirited y dance in the street. Other actors are Giinther Simon, Fred Delmare... M. Danegger. This is Cristal Bodenstein... in a decisive part of the plot: The mother returning to her family. Events are influenced by a swan and a torch of a kind you've never seen. H's a lie-torch. It brings forth simple but absolute truth. It's only fair to get something for one 3 money. Our story takes place in the town this helicopter and lighting tower are flying over. Uncle Konstantin, it's a peculiar book you brought me. I read and read, try my best, but don't get it. Its sentences are like water. Absolutely and irredeemably lost. Should a materialist say 'irredeemably lost'... given the law of conservation of mass? You know the bit, 'Everything there is large...'? 'The small, too.' Screwdriver. Wait. 'And Here the sun is all the stars. And every star...' - It doesn't fit. - No. - Well! - Yes. 'And each star is sun and all stars. In each, one part is predominant... and particular, yet at the same time, in it all other Hings are... apparent.' - What a memory you have! - For simple stuff, yes. - Think it's hanged? - I mean hung. - Yes... - Want to put in another? - Maybe... In one ear, out the other. Hm, that's philosophy for you. Now it's up. Is it running? Uncle, is it true that man is the product of his conditions? That's a moral issue. Just tell me. Okay, I concede, it's a truth. And I'm the relative... relative moment. Don't you have another book for the boy on dogs or animals or something? They get that in Biology. But language... Fine, a novel, Hen. About our lives or something. Go on. They're so shiftily written. Apart from one or two, maybe. I'm not sure men of He cloth say 'shitty'... Luther notwithstanding. You me-em Pm me. Look, a swan! Please stop saying such things to me. Someone might hear. A teacher, say. How am I to explain your reading such Hings and not Krambambuli or Paul The Puppeteer? He waves a hand... What was it called? Look, a swan. I've long wanted to explain to you... Everything develops from lower to higher! Right! It's perfectly evident. We first differentiate between animate and inanimate. I guess primaeval birds were tricky, too, when Hey showed up. Father, can you hit that tree with a stone or not? Let's see. No. I'm only asking whether you could. Com on. Davao! Please move all the way down, Sir. I'd like to logically classify this, Father. Don't react. Some hidden camera wants to film us looking foolish so Hey can put it on TV. He has no money. He'll have to get off. I have regulations to follow. I'll pay for the swan. Beat your wings. Watch out. Hey, come here. Quick. Swan, is the torch for me? Where are you flying to? Stay here. Come back. - Does this sentence sound good? - Read it. 'And for us children it was a wonderful experience when Juri Gargarin laid a firm cosmonaut's hand on our heads...' Good, huh? Let's write: 'Juri is a top guy. He stroked my head.' Lazes about but knows it all! Do your own stuff yourself. It's your composition, anyway. I always got 'A's for mine. Maybe it has no mass. It does have mass. Hang UP- Mother's away studying in Sweden. Not Sweden. In Schwedt. On the Oder, yes. My father happens to be sleeping. It's all right... - only it doesn't work. - What? Doesn't work? No one can say who made it. And He swan didn't sing. So, lime for supper. And if you don't eat up again, you'll be on a diet of noodles. What does He boy look like! - That's your sixth today. - No, my second. - It's working. - Falher, you're flying! Do it again, Father! I need to think about this. Mother's in Schwedt, Father’s Thinking. What? No, no! - White scholastic trousers are in stock. - Yes... The light was working. I started flying. Two entirely separate things. But I suspect there is a certain causal relationship. So do I. What is causal? Let's start at the beginning. Or, no... - Wait... - Mrs Sonneberg. Yes... But His is... I'll tidy away. - All these vitamins! - We were just leafing Hem cool. - I've long wanted to ask you... - What? Between a man and a woman... What? - No! - In front of He child! Yes, he's a minor. - To avoid misunderstandings... - There are none. - Not yet, but there might be. - Why? What do you want for your birthday? Noshing. There's really no need. Holy Boniface... Did you put me up here because I didn't dust? It won't happen again. Please let me down. You physicist! You know, Adam, we can't go around flashing His torch. We need a method to determine if it's really a lie-torch. Hey, move over! There's no scientific without method. You always said things get discovered by chance, like when they let something rot - and got penicillin. - Penicillin. So we'll just let it play out. One piece of proof is useless. A scientist needs thousands and test-checks. Anyway, there are two methods. We'll take He second: from hypothesis to proof. That's what we'll do. Yes, that's what we'll do today. Look, Here’s a woman out there. What did she say? I didn't gel it. Well, women... We'll call it a white lie. Cross it out. - We have to be precise. - Cross it. Precise and objective. They were oppressed for about 100 years, you know? She wasn't more than 40 years... oppressed. Uncle Kenny, we'll park up first. - How long have you known him? - Almost 15 years. We studied physics together. - And now he's a pastor. - Yes. He trained to be a pastor. Physics was a sideline. Can I take a flash at him? Give me Hat. Why did you take his torch? - Play-time's over. - Uh-huh? Come on, he looks sad. Constantine, don't interfere. Are you down on me? No... Just looking out for you. As ever. Sweet. Where are you going, Constantine? - To preach. Coming? - Yes! No... Come on, get up. No one can get in. What does Schiller say? 'Back, youth, back!' Come here, son. Papa's a bit dumb. You know Schiller? Careful, we got company. Adam and army vehicles to barracks. Soldiers singing on the yard there. Adam points his torch at them. Falher and Inconstant come and take it away from him. (Scene removed from the film scenario) Paris. The Seine runs through Paris this year and every year offering French workers leisured relaxation to the extent permitted by the ruling class. Cairo. The same goes for the Nile. Dresden. Experiments with an innovative torch have been supervised 5'! engineer Sew T ember. It can make people of both genders fly. When our father comes home at night he's reached his normal condition. Then he's what you call tired. Weary. There's only one cure. You take one single drop. One drop! And Papa's fine again! It's flabbergasting! We get thank-you letters all the time. We can hardly keep up with demand from workers. And it costs nothing more than a single squalid mark. It's giving it away! One drop and papa is pulling out Iris by the dozen! Golly! This lamp is a further proof of truly wonderful efficiency. Mass production of this torch, known as the L-Catcher... Who'd have thought it? I dreamt of Mama. Is she here? - Not even close. - Pity. Mrs Sonneberg, say... No, I'm saying nothing anymore. What a state he's in. Oh, tomorrow... Off to bed. - A package from your wife. - I meant to ask. Thanks. Come on, night will be gone by morning. How true. Don't play dead. Come along, off to bed. Come on. There... My Speller, are you very lonely? Hi. I've been here six months and still don't know if I like it. Our experiments resulted in a new kind of petrol with a catastrophic octane rating. I miss you terribly. Your hands... hands... hands... Did you eat a warm lech? Yes. And not smoke too much? No. - Are you ribbing? - I don't always have lime to eat. - You know I don't like thin men. - Or fat ones, Martha! Oh, Sepoy, my love. I heard this hit recently... That's not my thing, normally. But it really got to me. H's so like us. Back hen... Back hen... Back then things were lovely But we were much too young Much too young To know how truly we were lucky... ls Mama talking? I know it's stupid... but I cried so hard. And how is my good boy Adam? Well. How are you, Mama? - All light... - Mama! Mama. 4 remain your loving Mama. Mama, keep talking! - Mama! - Men don't cry. Unfortunately. My dear fellow, how I like it? Phenomenal! Everything is ready, the production line is at your disposal. Materials have come in, people sent out, union management is with us, your presence is eagerly awaited. And today's what, Monday? Fine. Tell me, MrTember, why does it makes people fly? - It's a lie-torch. - Aha. So if you tell a... Hen you... A-ha. - Sorry? - Aha. Ah! - And do we need Bethlehem'! - ‘{ es. Then we'll produce them. I'd be an excellent test candidate. The truth and I are diametric opposites. - I'm fake, top to bottom. - I know. I'm a lie on legs. Shine it at me and off I'll go! - You'll find me again as a... a... a... - A star. - What? - A fixed star. A fixed star on a leisurely orbit in a distant corner of the galaxy. Well, you think I was the director in spite of my moral reprehensibility? It's thanks to it! That's how! Go ahead and produce! I could go on for longer, but here's no point. What impresses you? I'm clever, knowledgeable, strong, handsome. Handsome above all! Hello. - Hi kids. - Boss. Our jaws dropped yesterday evening. I heard bells ring and realised I haven't been self-critical in along time. Self-criticism is when someone assails himself because he can't stand his reflection. That's what. Eisenhower! Yes, director? If I go too far, hit me over the head with a T-square. Yes, sorry. And you stay stump, Eisenreich. You're married, have children. I only meant to add, Tember, I'd like to drop my incognito completely: I'm a real, born and bred Walgan. Sadly that's not a true representation. And talk is cheap... Shut your gob. I said use He T-square. Can you afford to open your trap? I can. Because you're He ideal director. An orphan, single, no children. - Orphan... - invulnerable. What do you have against Walgan? His position was hopeless. Was he not innocent before reality struck, huh? What do you have against Walgan? His position was hopeless. Was he not innocent before reality struck, huh? I assume he had to lie so often so as not to lose his footing among the columns of figures, correct and erroneous sent by the Planning Commission. Yes... And what did he get? Help? Numbers, figures, and behind them commissions. My word! A commission is pure anonymity. - Throw a sack over his head! - Eisenreich! Just saying... I sometimes threw lies like stones. Six or seven times, maybe, out of wickedness. But a hundred times I lied to make orders from above harmless. They were based on errors and, I felt, couldn't otherwise be combated. And what became of me? I can judge my own case, Tember! The man you see, and I confess it to you too, Black Venus from beautiful Africa, casts off his yoke and says, I'm a pile of highly capable rubbish. An immoral organizational genius to whom truth and lies are noise. Directors laugh when they hear the word honesty. Want names? Please forgive me for my indiscretion. I've got that off my chest. Good luck producing the torch. - But boss! - Catch me. I told you to quit cussing! Excuse us. - I spoke up too loudly. - How about a drink? - A cigar... - I don't smoke yours. When will you finally qualify? But boss! - Hop-hop. - Hold me fight. You know, her landlady is really strict. I see. Oh, Lord, the whole place is packed. They're all so cheeky. Six of them. A handball team. Or a film company. Just ignore Hem. I'll get beer. If mother knew! - Hey, son. - Come in, kid. You're at home here. Someone turn off the music. Mate. - Is it hand powered? - Yes. An innovation. A development. I'll take note of this. - And who is this? - Our assistant. Assistant indeed! Muschel is my name. I direct comedies. The chews are... colleagues. - Author. - Hmm... We want to make a film about the torch. - A funny one. - You want to talk to my Papa about his? An interview? Unfortunately he's not in. Right. - What's your name? - Adam. - And your falser? - Sept Tember. I have some technical questions. Did you maybe write Uncle Tom's Cabin? That! I'd like to know why we have no writers. They have Hem elsewhere. In the Orient, Weimar... the Gulf of Finland. What's a director without a writer? A director is done for without a... Right? Does the torch function similarly to the computer? Ink-copper basis. Using the electric potential of the metals. What causes this? A crystalline structure in the metals. - Believe me. - I do. Copper need isolating with manganese dioxide. Then it's a depolarize. Fascinating. How long has this been known? Since 1789. Cheek me, Werner, and you'll be looking for work. - You half-pint. - Yes, Mr Mussel. What about costumes? You can't leave them naked! - It's cheaper... - Naked is expensive! So we are making a funny film, kids. Who do we make fly? - You have a feeling for that stuff. - And superiors, too. So who do we dare laugh about? Nice apartment. I like lying here, too. It's all worn out, He Persian. It shouldn't be beaten so often. You're on your own a lot, too, huh? It's a real problem. One time in Warsaw, or was it Moscow, Werner, dear? - Budapest. - We travel so much it's confusing. There was His Mr Schmalzl Here. It was in Bucharest. I remember. When we nailed on Schmalzl's hat? - His Grey hat. - Rubbish. Black. I swear it was Karlovy Vary. - Not Belgrade? - What? Where we nailed on Schmalz’s hat. All this travel! I'll be nailing on my next in Bombay. How will we accomplish flight? It's a problem. - No costs, please. - Costs! It's simple. - I've got it. - Huh? - Get the table. - First the chair... - Then over here. - What you doing with our table? Careful. Now put it down here. - But we need Hem to fly! - We'll be crafty. How? Come down here. - Good! - So I'm He star. Don't laugh, twits. Max... You and He camera - are standing Here. - Don't hurt yourself. Then it's as if I'm flying... - I'm hanging here. - Great! - Ed is flying. - Shame on you! Careful, watch out! - Down it goes. - You can't leave me hanging here. Humanly speaking, it's inhumane. If your mother knew, she'd give you what-for! Why did unknowable providence have to send me to Prussia? I'm caught on something. Who can we laugh about? - The pastor. - Rubbish. Where's your Mama? - Training in Schwedt. - Sweden? - Not Sweden, Schwedt. - Oh. Our chief says, we're not resentful but forget nothing, either. - Why do I mention it? - Here's some things we can laugh about. A random selection. It's incomplete. Are you insane? Adam, come here... Come on. Kenny. Bye! Take care, Adam. Why the sulky face? Are you going to church? Was that your sister? - No. - Was that your cousin? No. - Your aunt? - No! What shall I play? - That was lovely, Mr Inconstant. - One tries. With all these stops... It's art. - What's that one? - That one? - Yes. - The cox humans. There was... still a... How things collect... Want this? Yes. No? I read yesterday... we inhabit the terrain of change, no other exists. Nice corkscrew. - Need Hat many? - You need six, eight, maybe twelve. Technology delegations are small... or systemic failure is per-programmed. I need Hem so Hat at a climax, or with a curse, - I can smash one. - I've often admired it. You have? I didn't know. So, hooray! A“, Embellish.! - Give him a glass of wine. - As you say. - Going away? - Indeed. Which way? Up or down? - Here. - Thanks. I was just pondering a paradox. Blast! I've forgotten it. Too bad. I've been promoted. Good luck with your torch. 1000 are being produced. Chores! How's your wife and lovely Adam? I'm eager to follow from above the continuation of your saga. Are you aware that no torches have yet been reserved? Peculiar, isn't it? How long have we known each other? - 16 years. - 16! Cor! Back Hen I was... Oh, noshing. Well, the torch. Eight years I worked to plan here. I'll be doing He same where I'm headed. - Hope Chaffs the end of it all. - 16 years! Back Hen... I was 29. And back hen I still had hair. Eisenreich, throw that stupid hat away! I can't wear that. Why are you leaving? - He has to. - Shut it! We wanted to visit the chicken farm. What chickens? Oh, right! What a pity. You mean the ones out Here? - On He thoroughfare'). - Thoroughfare! Suddenly we're less formal. Yes. Here. - My names Sew. - I'm... Ehrenfried. But it's a nice name! Mate! Take care, hen. And drop us a line... so we know how you are. And... - don't go gamins. - Nor you. - Stay healthy. - Yes. You're a nature lover, anyway. Take care, hen... comrade. Miss Dingeldey, this is the director. Miss Dingeldey, you'll have to get used to me. In days of old, secretaries were out wile their bosses. As were the drivers. Make me a nice cup of coffee for a start. Over. Well, former director, Hohmann, I just don't know! Really he was a... inflowing! - Miss Dingeldey, here's the... - Director. You got it. I want all masters here at eight tomorrow. - The lady-masters, too? - Do we have any'? Fine, them too. Production meeting. It's about time order was made around here. Over. - The drawer is locked. - What is? The drawer. It's all that Hohmann ever locked up. Now he's forgotten it. Break it open. Why break it? Wait up. - There must be a key. - There's none. Nonsense. Let me employ the right tool. Now then... You'll break the desk. I happened to have... a hairpin. Hairpin? Em“ - That was Holman’s final ill deed. What did you hope for? Unpaid bar tabs? Exchequer underwear? Narcotics? I'm not made for this job. It's easy for you. You spent seven years at schools whilst I helped Hohmann walk the tightrope. I know nothing. But self-criticism is not a way of improving. Eisenreich. Hohmann called. He asked if we'd opened the empty drawer. I have three possibilities. Let's take along hard look at them: Resignation. - Faking it. - How about qualifying? I'd love to, but given circumstance: my wife's pregnant with our third. To keep you from integral calculus? One more wisecrack, and it's Tember, not Sept! But option four! We get you made director. You're the expert. Why should I blaze the way? You know... Thanks, no, Max. You'll manage somehow. At least be my union manager. We'd make a good team. You're afraid. It's good if people like you are afraid. Sorry, Max. I sometimes talk rubbish. Scaring someone is the most noxious Hing you can do. Come on... I have to know if Caroline really does love me. But just for one night. Count on my keeping quiet. Know where my falser is? I have milk for him. Are you free at eight? Sure, I'll be there. Once more and I'll even promise fidelity and other terrible stuff. - Really... - Caroline... would you marry me if I happened to say: Caroline, will you marry me? Come on, let's get out. Take the blanket. I'm a bit afraid. Me too. You know, that's normal. I don't even know what you... Careful... - I forgot something... - What? Must you? We were here first. What a display. Unbelievable. Get lost, you little bum! Don't get cheeky, chum! Stop there if you're a cavalier. I'm not alone here, gee! - Have you no shame? - That's good coming from you. - You'll catch cold. - They aren't pants. They're shorts, you dimwit. Shorts! - Whither water washes. .. - Listen, Caroline... - white horses... - Be quiet. whinny and whine. Caroline, dear, do you love me or not? No, no, no! Caroline, Caroline! Quit it. Come back down here, listen! Caroline! Erasmus! Poor deluded me. I'm such a moron. I knew it. I've been fooled. I sacrificed months for her and to what end? - A big nothing. - Erasmus. And on and on.. Doesn't love me, but... The torch doesn't lie. Like Robespierre. No lie can fool it. I trustingly ask, do you love me? Cool as a Caribbean cucumber: 'No, no, no!' So the conclusion I reach is, you actually said yes. You did say no, but... it means yes, yes-yes. Yes, no naturally means no. Yes, you lied wile a no. It's complex. A playful nature. You might conclude she's racy. I see now I mustn't dally, but have you or face tragedy. What a lot of goings-on His evening! If the lady might make way... I'm sorry but I have to spray here. My Third round. I'm done back there. Excuse me. - Are you from elsewhere? - Yes, I fell down here. Noshing phases me. There was a man called Hiibner from Grimma who blew his nose in black bras to 'avenge himself.' Nolhing phases me. Sorry, seen a black girl in a white dress? Sorry no. Try down to the left. Thank you. Caroline? He's following us. You're lucky I'm peaceable or you'd be for it. - For what? - It! - Forget it! - First you'll get it. I tell you. Have you no shame? She's not even old enough to vote. Hasta la vista. Nolhing phases me. I've been in fruit 20 years. Erasmus... Mrs Scraps is firing me. - Let her. Who cares? - I do. Let's get back out again. Yes. Do you love me? Oh yes, sweetheart. Caroline! Erasmus! But I thought I loved you! For the love of God, Dingeldey, get two glasses. The minister's coming, and Hey say trouble comes in twos. Can you get your hair done? Too bad. Give it your best shot. Comrade Simon! You're a minister? - You Ihink it's funny? - Nope! Nice. Very nice. Minister, I can tell you we took second place in stopping litterbugs. - I want to die. - No. I don't want to be a bother but He specimens are in. Hello, Caroline. When will you qualify as an engineer? - When you're a pensioner? - I'm hard at it. Only I'm having this crisis now. For the last four years. Think everyone's got ten years spare? Since you're so cheery, I've got good news. - The minister's here. - Good. Anything else? How am I to tell you? We tried the new torches, lied to beat the band... An older worker even fell ill. - You gave him water? - Yes. Go ahead, kill me, boss. They don't work. To put it nicely, the replicas don't work. Hello, tough guy. Hello you crooks. Ember, got a drink to hand? He's in the canteen. Switched at the last moment from noodle-soup to steak. The minister laughed. - So? - I thought there'd be trouble because you Med, Sew. The ways of our superiors are as mysterious as ever before. Somehow we get on, He minister and I. From the start. Ships that pass in the night. - Must you keep smashing the glasses? - Have I been? Potency and energy... somehow it just needs to break out. Ah, Adam. What's two limes two? A pointless question. Four. And He sum of angles of a Triangle? - One hundred and eighty degrees. - Hm. Thanks. Sit down. No, Adam. Pick on someone your own size. You two had trouble, huh Caroline? Nolhing serious. When I grow up you can be my mama. - Falher, did you know Moses... - What Moses? Sven Mittenzwey. Sven! No one can pronounce that. - We call him Moses. - Yes... It's easy to pronounce. If he gets a 'C', he gets thrashed though his dad's a comrade. Who is bringing me up here? Mother is often away. Mrs Sonneberg. Uncle Konstantin. What? I'm doing it. Thanks. Well you know... it's a subtle process... Hands out your pockets! Yes? In a second. Listen up... We failed. Leave He slide rule. Failed in what? We were totally accurate. Ask Caroline. But He batch of new torches just don't work. - They just shine normally. - Perhaps you're not lying right. No, we manage that. They just don't work. And I'm glad of it. I can tell you why. Turn around. What's wrong, chum. Come on? What's wrong? Don't you like the torch? How's tricks? Lots of sales? Adam, give me the torch. No way! What's the celebration for? Honestly! The minister's here. - There must be a reason. - The minister's here. Who put... Who put his... laurel bush here? I can't speak to you as if... - from within the woods. - Bravo! I'd like to explain, say... when we went over from riveting to welding... - We... - How long did it take? - Three to five months. - Too long. - I need to say... - Say away. It seemed reasonable to all colleagues that it would be faster and better to quit drilling holes, warming rivets... We call it warming Warming rivets, also known as studs, though Hat means something else... well... rivets needs to be red-hot... and you need Thousands of them. A welded joint saves lots of lime. A pity that He good college Ember, currently whispering with a rather pretty girl, has to leave. Where can he be? - This time he's really for it! - Go easy, Sept. The boy needs his molter. Must you stay in fourth? Use the gears. It's a two stroke. Gee. Gear-changing is no secret. Everyone can hear it. - You Think I should repair it? - Feel free. Hey , Sew. .. Mm. - I've fallen in love. - So, great. But He girl is only 20. So what? Too old for you? - I want to marry. - Fine. - Go ahead. - But she never attends church. Never. I don't mind you being an atheist, but her... Life's played you a fine trick, Konstantin. Another lover where you wonder how it'll end. Suddenly Adam mistrusted his beloved torch. He didn't know what to do. He wished Father or Kenny or Mother were there. But she was far away. Caroline, Erasmus... He didn't really know what to do, was exposed to danger... In despair he taught a Great Dane an elegant walk. This is what a situation with no way outlooks like. Adam and his falser in the car. They join a column of army vehicles. Recruits swearing allegiance at the barracks. Adam raises He torch. His falser takes it from him. (scene removed from film scenario after earnest reprimands. Not in script.) Come here! Come! But don't give him an earful. Konstantin! Did you want my advice or something? Oh, no. I just told you because it's so funny. Because it's so funny, you know? Because it's so serious! Falher, smash He torch. I can't. Put it among He others, they look identical. Do it quickly, Adam. Some things need doing fast. NOW! Turn around. Look again. Can you see it now? No. Can I take a torch? - One that just shines? - Sure. Why is it all so complicated? It's not complicated. - It's simple. - Will I ever understand it? When you grow up... dear Adam. Colleagues, help yourselves. The kitchen has outdone itself. It's a sight for sore eyes. You like it? Great. Wonderful. Caroline, come here. $3'! » - what's He party for? - The Minister's here. Honesfly. I hope you like it. Eat up, don't be shy. Excuse me, what's the party for? Well... it's not... Certainly. What's the party for? - Is He lady under your wing? - No, that's someone else. Pretty. Long live... beauty and 10S- Thank you. Boss, boss, boss... I'm off tomorrow, you won't be seeing me soon. Are you joining a monastery? Evening. Carry on talking. I'll act silent. No, I'm off to uni. Farewell, chlordane. I got a place at technical college. - Great. To study what? - Hydraulic engineering. - You do low current electrics! - Maybe we'll be underwater in 50 years, snorkeling away, who knows? - A destructive element? - On He contrary. Unhappy in love. Adam. Minister, it's a good moment. One question, please. Three marks. Four marks. You can get a plane construction kit for that. Almost. They cost 4.20. All right, five marks. Got it! The next morning, before school, Adam spent the money given him by Mr Eisenreich on a perfectly normal new torch. He gave it to Caroline, received a . What will she do with the torch? Stupid torch. Caroline! Lord, the city with the sun over the river. Always lovely. Did you know He city back Hen? - A bit. - It's my favourite in Germany. - I had a girl here at 19. - Same here. Hopefully not the same one. I didn't know the city then. It's said to have been more beautiful. Were you here during He bombings? No, I was a soldier back then. I flew a Heinkel. On He Eastern Front. I was among the late intake. Did you want the torch, too? The torch... Do you smoke? Yes. The little torch... Later. Whoops! Let's imagine Here was a torch. I have destroyed it, too. - There's no need to scruffiness. - Stefan, move. Either we trust people - or we'll just stumble along. - Come back.
