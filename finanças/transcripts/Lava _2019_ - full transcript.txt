(upbeat music) I like the design. Who did it? - Me. Wow, you draw very well. Yes, drawing is my life. I also make comics. - Comics? That's good. I thought they were only made in Japan now. There are still some. [Female] Tattoos, do they pay well for you? I can't complain. At first, it was difficult. Then I started having clients. You know, I'm not on Park Avenue, but business is going well. I also make designs and sell them. (speaks in foreign language) (man grunting) Ouch. Sorry, it's gonna hurt a little more, almost done. Well, that's good for now. We can continue tomorrow. Tomorrow? Same time? (dramatic music) [Nadia VO] It must be that guy's design. Yeah, it has to be. Or he stole it from here and lied to me. - How much is this? - Five bucks. (indistinct) (sings in foreign language) Hey, Nadia, what's up? Why are you cooking? I'm making baked potatoes. Lázaro's coming over in a little bit. What's the pot for? For the sauce, duh. You're not going out? No, that's why you see me cooking, silly. Season finale, "Gain of Clones." Samuel's coming too. So there's nothing going on with me and Samuel. Oh no, we'll see about that. I'm not ready. Don't be a bitch. Oh, shut up. You're so pretty, and it's time to meet some nice people. No egotistical psychopaths that suck your energy. Okay, okay, I get it. They manipulate you and lower your self-esteem. Yes, Nadia, we talked about this before. I'm not seeing him anymore. - You're much more valuable. (phone rings) Ah, it's them. They came so early. Debby, can you open the door, hurry. I thought true punks didn't watch TV. Everybody on the planet watches Netflix. [Débora] Oh yeah, well we're old school here. We download streams illegally, and read books heavy. - Hi, about this time. Debby, please meet Samuel. He works with the last in the shops. Sam, meet Debby, she is amazing. Yes, we've actually met before. It's ready. Here we go, guys. Shut up, Debby. (metal clanking) (TV buzzing) Holy shit, what happened? Debby, check cables at the back. (TV buzzing) Where's the remote control? What the fuck! The TV broke. Hey Debby, restart the computer. (TV buzzing) I'm gonna cut the power. Is it all right with you, my love? Yeah, yeah. Go, go. Honestly, I have no idea what's going on. (suspenseful music) Guys. (suspenseful music) Holy shit! No service. The radio, the radio. (radio buzzing) (Samuel screams) Listen. (radio buzzing) You see? The phone sounds like the TV. Nadia, wake up. Nadia, Nadia, please help me with her. Turn off the TV. Débora, turn off the radio. Nadia. (bomb blasting) What's going on? Oh my gosh. I'll get her some water. Nadia, you have to wake up, wake up. What happened? You were hypnotized. It's those images. There's just something awful is happening. Guys, look. The internet is back up. Did my mom text you? (police siren blaring) [Radio] We interrupt this broadcast 'cause a very strange event has just occurred. But my operator and I, have no memory of the last two minutes. We are very concerned. (keyboard clacking) Guys, should we keep watching? [All] Yeah. (metal clanking) Well folks, I gotta go. Did you have fun? Yes, let's do this again. Debby, can you help him? Yeah, oh yeah. What (indistinct) series, huh? This must be the third time we've met, right? Yeah. Hey, did you tattoo Lázaro? That horrendous tattoo on his arm? No way. I even told him I'd fix it for free. (laughs) Oh Débora. How are you getting home? I live 10 blocks over that way, not far. Oh, that is close. You know, you can walk. Yes. Come by the shop sometimes so I can show you my designs. I'd love to see what you think. All right, maybe I'll go with Nadia next time she goes. All right, bye. Bye. [Débora VO] If he turns around, it means he wants something. It's cold. (door thuds) You are a great artist, Débora. It's perfect, skin-fit. What exactly is this design? What does it mean? If I tell you, I'll ruin the end of the Débora comic. You have to read it from the first to the last page. It is important. Oh right, the comic. I have it. I brought it to read. Snake, it's weird. (indistinct) The snake of chaos. Have you ever read the Nordic mythology? I don't think so. It moves, the tattoo, it's curling up. (indistinct) Was a gigantic snake, and it grew bigger and bigger everyday. One day, (indistinct) fuck the snake and threw it into the sea. But the snake had grown so big. It could bite its own tail and embrace the world. It's so fascinating. It's alive. (suspenseful music) (police siren blaring) (murmuring) What are they looking at? What happened? They're all staring up at the rooftop. Why? Let's go find out. (suspenseful music) Oh my God. What is that? No one knows what they are, but they are everywhere. There are two more around the block. Oh those are like statues. I know but it's a cat. Look at that! Mum, what's happening? I don't understand. - I don't know, my son. I don't know, go inside. Hurry up, hurry up! (indistinct) Snakes and cats running around their cities. Though the cats seem they just wanna observe the people, but the snakes (indistinct) It wasn't a nightmare. Those things are still there. How can you sleep like that? I envy you. It could be the end of the world, and you're still calm. What did the news say? Invasion. (gun fires) A mysterious satellite and stationary orbit could be responsible for the invading signal. Its origin is unknown. (indistinct) To back you and help protect you. So don't worry, just stay aside. We're building walls, we're protecting the people as much as we can. (murmuring) Experts suggest it's extraterrestrial. Big cats are invading us. It's terrible, and no one has a clue, why? No one went to work today. The government said to stay calm but they've sent armies into the streets. It's the same all over the entire world. - Have you seen a fanzine? - A fanzine? No. (car engine roaring) [Débora VO] So it's true. We're being invaded. Why are there no signs of violence or destruction? What if it's not an invasion? (murmuring) Don't shoot it. We don't know what it wants yet. Affirmative, fire! (gun fires) (screaming) (suspenseful music) Today could be my last. I have to see him, just one more time. So that's her. God, she's pretty. You need anything? I'm closing. No, no, okay. [Débora VO] Débora, you're so stupid. You're such an idiot. This time is really over. Next time he calls, I'm gonna tell him. I'm going to say, I'm going to say it. We're done. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) [Edgar] Debby, you came by today? You didn't tell me. It's over Edgar. We are through. I came to say that we shouldn't see each other anymore. [Edgar] I agree with you, Débora. I respect your decision. I'm calling you about else. - What? [Edgar] Everything will work out, Débora. You are far more special than you think. Tattoo artists are the chosen one. Nothing will happen to us. You are not ready to understand yet, but something big is going to happen, something good. What are you saying? You lost your mind? [Edgar] Something fantastic is about to happen, something amazing. It will change the world. You have to be with me. Be with you. [Edgar] Soon you will understand better than anyone. I have to be with you. Did you say I have to be with you? (car honking) Hello, hello! (tire screeches) (man screaming) Hello guys! Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry, sorry. Pardon me, sorry. Excuse me. Hello. Hello. Oh, he was just standing in the middle of the street. What happened? - Hello. Oh wow. Wait, don't do look at your phone. Don't look at your phone. Don't look at your phone. (tire screeches) (indistinct) (bomb blasting) (police siren blaring) (cars honking) [Nadia] Yes, it was all (indistinct) the world. I feel that those images want to tell us something, as if there were a mystery, a message to decipher. It's fascinating. I don't feel scared when I'm paralyzed. I don't feel anything. Nothing at all. Did anything happen to you? Well, I was at home, making a meal for myself and then the water boiled. Okay, I think you should stay off the phone and don't look at those images. You think? And how's Lázaro? He's fine too. The images don't affect him either. He called me from work today. [Débora] He's good, he's good. - He's fine. And your dad? Is your dad okay? Has he recovered from the fall? I think I'm going to stay with him today. Okay, good. Listen, the fanzine you mentioned before it came in today. - Good. - No, no. Look at it. It's all there. All what's there. (murmuring) [Débora VO] What the hell is going on? [Lázaro VO] Welcome to the survival manual, created by Lava. This comic is a practical guide to help humanity survive the many threats they'll face in the days following the publication of this special edition. Lava has anticipated the problem and created this easy-to-read comics so you can know how to react to the danger ahead. Why a comic? The enemy knows our modern communication systems and how we use them. Understand this, our screens now belong to them. The fanzine comic has proven to be a very useful medium, due to its limited distribution and non-existing quality controls. At a certain time, the statues on top of your houses will come to light life. Like old cats, they can be repelled with water, although we recommend the use of cable rifles. By filling out this coupon, you can receive a free M16 light defensive weapon with five iodine tablets ideal for those who cannot resist image-induced paralysis. You must avoid any audio-visual contact. It is the enemy's main weapon. They understood the importance of mass media in this culture, and they are using them to spread their (indistinct) The use of these weapons for the resistance is essential. Incredible. I never thought you could make a gun with a toaster, a hairdryer and a barbie. They sent in different pieces so that nobody would notice, very clever. We should tell Nadia. Let's tell Nadia. No, don't tell. - Why? - We have to tell Nadia. It's better this way. Well, I think it's best if we tell her. Why would we leave her out? Nadia is so fragile. She's going through a tough time, (indistinct) stress her out a lot more. Now, let's see if this rifle works on that giant weird cat. Yeah. - Shoot the cat? - With our gun. It didn't hurt us. - We bought guns. - No, no, no. We got the guns for free. Same, same. The fanzine said, "We could throw water at it." Let's just try that first. Fine. What a stupid idea that was! Hey, it was your idea. Hey, hey, my loves. What were you three doing? Deb, did you read the fanzine? Did you tell them about it? (murmurs) You stay here, we'll be back very soon. Okay bye, bye. (door thuds) Here, take it. Wow. Are we ready? Samuel, turn it on. (water burbling) Nope. Okay. (water burbling) Oh wow, it didn't work at all. And what's that noise? (helicopter blades whirring) (helicopter blasts) (indistinct) I think it's starting again. No, no, no. Run, run, get outta here! (screaming) Jump. Thank God, we are animated. Get back here! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. There's more cats coming. (fist thuds) No, I'm not perplexed. (water burbling) Back it up, boy, back it up. Back, back, back it up. They look pissed. We should turn around and leave, like now. I am absolutely not prepared for this, run! Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Well, well, it seems that your friends were not that far away off the road, right? This weapon is amazing. It turns them into good kittens. Oh, but not for long. My love, daddy, I met this old man on the street. He's a really good guy. Get over here. I also met this bus driver too. He's a really good friend to have right now. Come on guys, get in, get in. Can I go too? Yeah sure. Sorry, Sam, I didn't see you. Yeah, yeah, come on, come on. Yeah all right, here we go. Please, come in. No, no, no. (tire screeches) (laughs) (screaming) Come on. Hurry up. Come on girl, help me outta here. Could you save anyone else? No, it wasn't possible. Wow that's the bus driver. I gotta get outta here. Well, is no one gonna save me? You stay here, we got this. (snake hisses) At least it was quick. How much we could have done. They're coming, this way! Run, get inside. We have to pretend we hit the diced, right? Get in the cinema. Hide. (birds chipping) Debby. We're going in the water, it's too hot. You wanna come with us? No, no, I'm kinda cold. Hey, come on. Come with us, hey. Get in, Débora, it's beautiful. You'll see. [Edgar] Débora, can you picture a skin that reinterprets your designs. Edgar? And intelligent skin. It gives life to your work but gives it a whole new meaning. There is a creature with skin like this. The most beautiful creature in the universe. It's beauty hurts. I have tattooed on its skin before but when I did the images moved. My defects disappeared and my virtues were enhanced. Its skin came alive, it's amazing. It will revolutionize the way we make art. Come Débora, it's beautiful. You'll see. The canvas grows, it stretches, it will be the longest comic strip in the world, the book that grows in volume everyday, a cartoon that breeze, a mural whose wall thinks and walks the definitive arts, no one can resist its beauty. What if I don't like it? What if I'm not interested? Then you are dead, Débora. Like Lava, dead with envy. Another frustrated artist, full of hatred for the ultimate beauty. Debby. Oh, I'm naked. What do I do here? What do I have to do? Débora, Débora. Débora, Débora! - I... - What happened? Did you get hypnotized? I don't know. I fell asleep. I thought it didn't affect us. Nadia, Nadia. Are you all right? Did you get hypnotized? Nadia. You found the pills we ordered? How did you get on the bus? Yeah, no, thanks to you. I wanted to tell you, I wanted to tell you about the guns. I wanted to tell you about the pills but Lázaro said not to. I went into your room and searched through your stuff. I saw that you had sent in the coupon for the guns and the pills. I got them just in time. I went to look for you, and Mr. Gutierrez called me from the bus. He saved me. Wait, not so much longer. A resistance, are they organized? Obviously, some people are not affected by images. That's why I found it strange that you went on your own. Now, Lázaro is dead. Had you stayed with me, all of this would've been different. But Nadia is also asleep and Lázaro like Débora. They didn't want me to call. I'm crying for Lázaro. Turns out he's just a moron, and you are a lousy friend. What did I do? I didn't know. Yes, you knew. He told you when we climbed the stairs. He grabbed you and he told you, and you said nothing. I didn't say anything because... Can't you see that Lázaro wanted to fuck Débora? You really are such a tramp. A tramp. What about Lázaro? Oh, so you're gonna fuck Samuel too. A tramp. Oh, don't give me that. Don't mess with me. Choose your partners better asshole. I wouldn't Samuel because he's just unfuckable, no offense. I want to fuck Edgar. Edgar with the tattoos? He's married. I guess any dick will do for you. You lied to me. You told me you were over him. You are so stupid. I wanted to make you jealous, duh. (laughs) Very funny. Really, huh? Oh God don't, no. Débora, I love you. I'm sorry, Nadia. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm so sorry for Lázaro. I don't know what's wrong with me. All this is affecting me so much. I'm scared and I don't know what we're gonna do. Let's not fight. Oh, I can't fight. I can't even take care of myself. Calm down, Deb. The old man said, "Lava could help us." What is Lava? What is Lava? I don't like this. Lava is what just saved us. It did? Let's stick together. Yes, everybody together, together, altogether, or both of you together with me, me too? No, you guys together, fine, or how about all of us together. Wouldn't that be fun? I'll be back. (snake hissing) (wings flapping) Welcome everyone. If you are here, it's because you are a chosen one. At first, I didn't understand anything. A voice spoke to me and told me the most important things one needs to know. This place is for the people who don't fit into the world, the weirdos, the freaks, but the wait is over. A new world is upon us and we will be the leaders of it. Narcissus has chosen us. You will have the greatest honor an artists can have. Tattoo the Narcissus, enter through the door on your left, and you will find tools and other stuff to express yourselves. Débora! Has anyone seen Débora, a girl with glasses? Has anybody seen her? Anybody know Débora? (suspenseful music) All right everyone, let's take this nice and slow, camera one and camera two. (suspenseful music) You like it? Do you know that girl? We dated for a while. Had a good time. She's an excellent tattoo artist. She'll be here soon. The Narcissus is eager to work with her... [Female] Silence. Don't mention Débora. Are you... [Female] They cannot hear me. Thanks, it's a good tattoo. [Female] They can't hear me. I'm only in your mind. Or you... [Female] Don't speak, get up. Come to me. Lave is the enemy of (indistinct) an enemy with an undeclared war, a cold war. And it gives us the weapons to fight. It can't intervene, so it must teach us how to fight. I met Lava a long time ago. It taught me many things. It taught me not to flout my intelligence. And what are we gonna do? Are we gonna do whatever Lava wants? Are we gonna be its soldiers? Not to attract attention. No choice. I'm a tattoo artist, I'm ordinary. I'm not trained. I can't win a war. This is nuts. We have a no choice. They came to look for us. The few who want to consume their garbage but you know what you can do, watch the movie. I can't watch. All I can think about is what happened to Lázaro. Débora, did you like Lázaro? What? I don't know. It just seemed like... - Seemed like what? I don't know. I mean, I get that you're stressed about him. I'm stressed too, very stressed. But it just seemed like maybe, you know... No, not even close. Okay, okay. It was just a thought. - Okay. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I could be telling you anything. Like maybe you have a question on me or something, who knows, I'm just saying, did you hear what I said? And I said, maybe you have a crush. - Yes, I heard you. - Yeah, I heard you. Would you guess wrong? About a little... Stop! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I misunderstood. I thought you said you would like us all, but now you're interested in me. Stop, you're stupid, selfish child. Can you take one second to think about what's going on here? What are you doing here? The woman must be treated like the petals of a rose. I know, I am expert. So you can also teach me how to do what to women. No, just giving my opinion. Thank you. But I didn't ask for your opinion. Hey, you have to learn how to accept the criticism. The Chinese girl got into tank. (metal clanks) Oh I can't drop the tank. Excuse me. Oh, guys they killed (indistinct) All right, (indistinct) (gun fires) The true enemy is rarely seen in combat but if they show up, you must avoid physical contact. The (indistinct) lack of central nervous system for pain. Long ago, they abandoned their true skin. Check it out. Let me see it, what is here? Let me see it. It's right over here, come on. As soon as a (indistinct) don't make many friends. Don't wanna learn everything they can about skin culture. They will contact dermatologist, cosmetologist and tattoo artist. Tattoo artists are the most important. Are you Lava? Lava is your friend and it is here to help you. Do not grow or seek. For security matters, Lava can not trust its collaborators. Inform your friends and family that with all your health, the (indistinct) can be destroyed. No, you see, take this. (gun fires) okay, let me try again. (gun fires) Son of a bitch. I might know how to go on (indistinct) this time. (gun fires) It seems like we got it. I think we got it. Yes, we got it. It's a beautiful thing. It's a machine. It's starting to move. Let's go. No, it's jammed. He must have a technical problem, of course. But (indistinct) (car engine roaring) Do not try to find me. Do not try to find me. (witch expectorates) Good, he's not following us. - Oh shit. - Oh no. (indistinct) Don't stop, I'm fine. Son of a bitch. Whoa. Oh the way. (Lázaro crying) (dramatic music) Sorry, am I in Buenos Aires? No, this is rather (indistinct) central station in (indistinct) To go to Buenos Aires, you must enter again. Walk three steps to the left and then two to the right. Okay, thanks. (witch expectorates) I know what's going on. Don't think about the witch. (witch expectorates) Don't pay any attention to her, whatever you do. She can hear her thoughts. (witch expectorates) What'd you say? Hey, you like her? - What. - What. What's wrong with this girl? Is everyone gender-fluid now? You like her, I can tell. You've been floating this entire time. Can you just admit it already? I do not think that we've been flirting this entire time, but okay, maybe she's referring to what you said in the cinema that wanted to make me jealous with Edgar. I don't know, something like that. Something like what? Are you flirting with me? I wouldn't mind if you are. I wasn't serious. You're not, are you serious? I mean, I think you're really cute, but I don't know if it's the right time, I guess. I don't know if I'm ready for a commitment right now. It's just a weird time. I don't know. I've never thought about you like that before. Well, you are flirting with me a little bit. Yes, I do find you attractive. And I'm curious to see what it would be like to be with a woman. For me, you know, I'm open to trying. Whoa, this is the adult part. This is the moment when we depart from cinematic formula and we talk about topics that are not usually discussed in animation. Let's be honest, that's what makes this movie so special, in addition to being science fiction and having a giant witch chasing after us. (witch expectorates) Everything would be different if Lázaro was here with me. Lázaro is a dick. You don't know him. I've heard some stuff. (phone vibrating) [Man] Congratulations. Lava wishes to thank you for your excellent performance. You have survived the attack. You figured out on your own, the ultimate secret of (indistinct) They feed off of our attention. They needed to exist. Ah, so she was right. - Yeah. - Hello, who are you? Who is it? Hello. (cars honking) - No. - Don't leave. Hey, let's stick together. Yeah, no thanks. Check you later, suckers. [Man] Lava is your friend, and it is here to help you. Very soon, Lava will provide you with the necessary means for your liberation. It only asks for one thing in return, you must remain anonymous. - Ah. - Wow. Hey, you guys. I'm glad you guys are cool. Nadia, let's toast of our love. (fist thuds) Well, I'm truly shocked. I'm astonished at your immature behavior. Not like us. We just had an adult conversation about bisexuality Come on, guys, we have to get serious here. Sure, now you want to get serious, after you've screwed everything up, after you left me completely alone to fend for myself. You didn't even care if I was alive. You just wanted to fuck Débora. That is just half-true. You know what? I was heartbroken when I thought you had died back there. Now, I don't care. You are a jerk. Débora is far more interesting than you. I wish you had died instead of Mr. Gutierrez. You're so, so I guess. Don't mess with Mr. Gutierrez. Now that he's dead, the whole resistance is crumbling. Not at all. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Right now, Lava is infiltrating the very heart of the invasion. Only Lava can defeat the (indistinct). Guys, we must act now. Act how? What we avoid being killed? Because I'll tell you, that's what we've been doing all day. So if that's the plan, count me out. Escaping, conquer, Débora. That's what we've been doing since the beginning. Weren't you taller? Anyway, I have self-respect. Your true colors came out. Thanks to that. I was able to learn much more about myself. And now, Debby and I, are much closer than you think, right Debby? Like I said before, I'm open to exploring this as long as it feels right for both of us. Nadia and Débora are lesbians with each other. Really? Crazy, huh? Debby admitted she had a crush on me. - No. I said, I might like you, and I'm not flirting with you. That's what you said five minutes ago. But I get it, you're still confused. Look, maybe I'm still confused too. Well, other (indistinct) experiences. So is true about, Débora, do you like her and Débora likes you? - Are you jealous? - What, of Débora? No, I don't know. What, ah, go to hell! Débora is your friend. And she's also your friend. Okay, I admit it, I've never heard such thing. (upbeat music) Is this a grid, like a TV guide? Or a comic book would be better. Lava just gave us the most important information. Here are the invasion days and times. The days and times, when the invader will carry out his broadcast. We have to get this information out to everyone. So everyone will know what their schedule is. The next one is the day after tomorrow at 3:00 PM, lasting six hours. Okay, everybody turn off their phones and screens one minute before. In fact destroy all screens. Debby, you're such an extremist. Maybe it's enough for everyone to just turn off their phones and TVs and stay safe in their homes with their loved ones. What? Nadia be honest. Did you find your tablet and destroy the screen? (indistinct) We destroyed all the screens. Let me at least have the tablet. But it defeats the purpose. People can still see the images. You can't expect people to destroy all their technology. How would we survive without it? Lázaro, didn't Lava say a big invasion was coming. Look at this ad. Yes, but Nadia is not all wrong. Maybe, it's okay to watch a series once in a while. Especially now that winter is coming, cuddling would be nice. You little nincompoop. Cuddling is a good idea. Don't you think, Débora? Well, I guess, I don't know. Lava summons us, lets go. - Yeah. - All right. Come on, Débora. Come on, cheer up a little please. Okay, let's go. (doorbell rings) Hello guys. Hello Débora. Oh, hi. I'm glad you all came. We need you. Come in, leave your folders on the table. All right. We need the best artists. Our comics must reach the world. It's the only way to fight the (indistinct) All these people for one fanzine? Samuel and Lázaro, your designs are very good. We need you in the art department. Here are your boards. Nadia, I've read your CV. It is impeccable. Do you think you can handle the layout? I'm perfect for the job, hire me. Excellent. You'll be part of the design team then. Thank you, so, so much for this opportunity. Thank you. And you Débora. Yeah. I don't know, honestly. You might not be ready. I do like your art, but you need to develop it further. Hello, I'm the one who tattooed the back of your neck, bro. I know, but this is different. This demands perfection. Why does it have to be perfect? Why are you so many people? If you want to spread an idea, just write a manifesto. Débora, please. You just need some training, maybe that's all. Come with me. (pencil scratching) You can practice. Try to reproduce these images. Wow, very pretty. Yeah, I'm not sure I can but, oh, thanks. (pencil scratching) (indistinct) (screams) What's up? (suspenseful music) Keep on trying, Débora. - What does this mean? What is this? Books can also get people's attention. I don't care. I don't care, this is crazy. Wake up, open your eyes. Why do you need me? They use the screens. We use the books. You see, we need you to defeat the invader. You are, you're an invader. Wait! We have to get out of here. They're invaders. They are all invaders. - Debby, wait. - It's a trap. They're both the same. Debby, please stop. You're sabotaging me. Lava loves humans. They're helping us. They gave us weapons, a grid. They helped me escape. It's a lie. You are being lied to. There are no time for thing you can do (indistinct) and then ignore it. Hey, look. This is my hero. You are free to go. You always have been. I know you'll come back. We share the same enemy. It's not my fight. Maybe you are right. If not, you are fucked. Hey, Débora, Edgar was looking all over for you. (laughing) (upbeat music) [Female] Testing, testing, one, two, three. Testing, mind communication. That's it Debra. It's over. [Débora VO] Why are you doing this? Why did you invade us? [Female] It's too late now. We can't go back. You'll have to accept it. [Débora VO] I wanna meet you. I wanna meet you in person. I wanna know who you are. Why us? Why here? That'll be five bucks. [Female] We love your art. Let's work together. (suspenseful music) From this moment on, planet Earth has been conquered by civilization VS25.
