I am opponent to him, because he thinks he is great! He plays God himself. How long have I known Lo Ping? More than ten years. It's 1991 now, more than ten years. It's a must to fight. I won't mind fighting till 1999. I've watched many films about wars, no matter how tricky he is, I should start the guerrilla with him. Now, I will show you the scenes at the Harbour Century Hotel. We're told that some citizens were hurt. This is a live report from Mok Siu-han in Macau. What happened at that time? It's a mess, it's really horrible. No one dares to come here again! Who will come to gamble? About the chain violent cases happened in Macau, it's related to the benefits from controlling the casinos. In the past two months, many people were hurt from several shooting cases. One of the key persons related in the cases, Mr. Giant Wan... is interviewed by us, please pay attention to his interview. Boss? He is righteous and bold. Of course, many people dislike him. As being a triad, people don't care about life. If you are a chicken, if you don't fight with all your might, who will be scared? Go... Boss is weird, he doesn't smoke or drink. It's really hot! Woo, it's great. I won't stick to something I may be addicted to. I want to be alert any time. But I don't mind dancing. Arrogant laughs to the troubled water. My blood is as hot as the sun. I've got strong body and guts. I think big and have a generous heart. I just want to be a real hero. To be a hero. I have to work hard everyday. A hero has blood as hot as the sun. I don't want to see my boss gambling. He is so serious. I just love gambling. The worst time I had... I lost 11 times consecutively. Five and four, magic more! Super Buddha! Go... Go crazy! The banker's got ten. The player wants one more card. The player's got eight. The banker wants one more card. You always bring me eight or nine, what a good guy! But your eight will lose to one who gets nine. More, more... Being late is better than nothing. Real hero... must go crazy! Damn it! Don't let him gamble? Don't let him gamble! Haven't you seen fishes don't swim? He will gamble even though he isn't allowed to enter the casino. The banker's got eight. The banker's got eight... Boss, the banker's got eight. Don't worry, maybe we'll get a nine. The player's got seven. Boss, the player's go seven. Once you keep on gambling, you can not define yourself a loser. Don't worry, again! There is nothing worth talking about me. Why not talk about my mom? We are like buddies, is that right? At first, I worried most. He got hurt often. But, later, I am used to that. I just hope he would come home alive. So you're talking about the shot at the glass of the hotel? In the past four months, total 8 shooting cases happened. You and Lo Ping who is nicked named Mo-Io Ping are involved. This time, poor pedestrians were hurt. What do you think? I like to kill him anytime I like. Do you think this is done by me? You mean someone wants to frame you? Detraction pursues that great. They will blame everything on me. So you are a triad kingpin, aren't you? We make a living in the triad society, what do you think? Yes or no? I run a benefiting company, who works for me will get benefit. Please tell us the conflicts between you and your rival, Ping. How much time do you have? It depends on how much time you can spend. At first, when I was small potato in Macau, Lo Ping was very arrogant! At that time, he was a kingpin. At that time, they made a living major in loaning money. Or, blackmailing... Having a fortune? Boss, have you won much? What's the matter? Give me some tips please. What do you want? Give him a hundred. Take this. One hundred? You'd better save this for buying paper money! Take two hundred for the ticket. It's your fault. Let's go to have some noodle. Liu has a buddy named Lee, he is from the neighbourhood. It's easy to win... Come on! Make a bet, you'll win easily! Open. A! Sorry, bet again! Come on. It's easy to win! It's easy to win! Alright, I'll bet on the middle. Why don't you open? Open! Bingo! Serve you night! Pay now! You moron! Pay now! Here comes the police! Run! Although we belong to different companies, we always stay together. You must be tough to be a rascal. Even you teeth and hands are broken, you should keep on fighting. He is crazy! Run! You want to get famous, there is only one way. That's to be tougher than others. We started to get famous. People give us a nick name. That is the "Seven Luck Folks". Have you ever heard of Big Head Fo? You invented that? Working more for the triads, we were getting more and more famous. This is a piece of land for heroes. You'd better watch, One day, I'll control all the casinos in Macau. No my permission, even the governor can't gamble there. Who are you? Don't you know him? He is Giant. I have nothing to say. My mouth is for eating, not talking. Just bread? How about a bottle of red wine? So what is a triad not smoking or drinking? What are you laughing at? I'm fetching it for you, brother To. It'll be quick. How can you be a boss? You are not as smart as a small potato. Where were we? Yeah, I remember. Now I am waiting... What are you waiting for? I am waiting for the red wine... and for arresting those bastards who mess up Macau. Mr. To, how do you know Mr. Wan? More... It's useless! God damn it! Shut up, or I will beat you! Sorry, no more... No more... I am sorry! Eight! Damn it! An eight always meets a nine, is that right? Yeah, it's right. More... More... No more, blow it away! Damn it! Do you want to pull a prank? All my chips are on the table, what prank I can pull? You are same as Giant. That bastard covered the cards and walked out for one whole day. What do you mean? Don't touch me! Stop... None of your business, don't bother us from working. Get lost! What kind of world it is? Who is in charge of Macau? Police or triads? You bastards always mess up there! I don't care who is in charge of here, I just know that this is Brother Lone's turf. What did you say? Whose turf do you mean? Take him back to the station. It's Liu. I heard that you and Giant are the famous stars lately. Really? Do you really mean it? You guys are fishing in the troubled water again! Are we as famous as Jackie Chan? Get him back! Damn you Fatty! Brother Giant... How is it? Nothing, the police just wants to pull off a stunt. Don't you think I can't afford that? Me? Forget about him! Are you Giant? So you are To? I heard that you are rising rapidly lately. I heard that you haven't been promoted in all these years. Why do you break it? Do you want to lose your temper on me? You are too cocky but alive! God is too kind to you. No, God isn't kind to me, but God isn't nice to you. He asked me to fix you! To hell with you! Enough? Not yet. I heard that you want to rise. You are like caecum. If I don't get rid of you, you will cause trouble to Macau. I tell you, don't let me get a chance to fix you. Otherwise, you will not have any good time! Let's go. I will return the punches to you. No need, I send this specially for you. I think you'll get no chance to return it. Damn your mom! My mom died, you'd better go to hell for her. What's up? Are you alright? Damn it! I was beaten up. It's alright. Are you alright? It's them! Kill them! Move to the wall. After him! Bastard! Don't go! Get in... Stop! Chase after him! Luckily Liu is wise. He knows they will never give up, so he asked me to come here. Damn it, if we do something, how can we make a living? Attack at once. But we have limited fellows. They can gather hundreds of people easily. Look before we leap. Ching Long will never give up like this. I know someone powerful in the police force. Why not ask them to negotiate for us. I hate dealing with cops. Have you seen the gamblers save money to bribe the cops? It isn't worth. He will find us by all means. What shall we do then? Let's gamble with all we have. If we win, we'll be rich and famous. If we lose, we'll die together with him. Brother To. You are really something! You've got a pretty girlfriend! Are you jealous? You can make it too. I wish that too. You don't want to carry your guts to ask for help, do you? Come out... Go... It's fixed! You are always so nice to give me eight or nine! So what? Damn it! He takes an eight again! He is really lucky! You're dead meat! Macau is like taking a public bus. You can sit if you like. If you don't, you can stand. Otherwise, you'll be run over sooner or later. I am doing what I should do. I am the police, I am obliged to arrest whoever messes up Macau. It's lawful, what wrong did I make? My bosses is the Macau Government. Let's not talk about the government. Why not talk about your debt. How much do you want? Just tell me. You are a thief, I am a soldier, we can't make a compromise. You bastard always make trouble! Lone, I will put you to dead end, I promise. You mean it? Let's wait and see how long will you live! Lone, we are the losers this time. We have to go now. Go... Squat! Everyone squat! Squat! Squat! We have something personal to talk to Lone. There is nothing to do with you all. Sorry for bothering. I'll treat you to a meal as apology. Kill them! Kill him... How dare you! Isn't it funny when you tried to kill me? Sit properly! This is a great return! You counter attack when my fellows are not around. That's why people said Giant and Liu are good partners. I am all eyes. You block all our way out, that's why we should do like this. You come a long way here, what do you want? From now on, no matter who is right and who is wrong, we will forget the past, what do you think? Why should I listen to you? Shoot me to death if you have guts. Right here! Stop nagging! Just kill him! Good1 How bold are you! I tell you... If you harm me, I want you and your family apologize to me in hell. Let's gamble! If you win, everything will be over. If you lose, I will kill your whole family. I've made my offer, what do you think? If you don't have guts, just step aside. Don't waste my time. Save it! We still have a dozen bullets. We can kill them all. Tell you boss. This is done by me. Alright, I'll gamble with you! Where is your lucky chip? I wanna bet all. Even God helps me! Don't put off a stunt. Get lost. Don't lose your mind. That's it! Giant, stay where you are. Why did you help me? I owed you that. I will return three punches to you when there is a chance. You are really something! I seldom see triads not allying with the cops. I seldom see police not allying with triads too. I tell you! Don't let me get you anything. I will arrest you! Would you tell me anything creative or new? Government warning, triad activities are prohibited in Macau. Those commit crimes would be beaten up. Isn't it creative? Just as Liu said, when this case was spread all over, we became famous. Our fellows are getting more and more. Some of my assistants have been followed me since then. Say Kwok Ho, he is calm and patient. He never disappoints me. Tai Hung, he is brave and always gives me surprise. Happy Ghost? Whether he is a great drive as he bluffs, I don't know. But he is a woman magnet. We became a new force in Macau. At that moment, someone came to us suddenly. And this person started all the conflicts and bloody cases. That's Chan. Giant, are you interested in working in my casino? Ping used to take care of your turf. Isn't it wise to have one more source? Ping used to take 60 million a month. I will offer you the same condition. Do you have guts? Give me a reason. What reason? The reason why I dare not take your offer! Good! I know what's going on. Ping thinks that he is a native in Macau, he doesn't respect Chan at all. And he is getting more and more cocky. Chan wants me to balance the power. He came to us for we were new. We were freshly established, So he thought he could control us. Ping isn't a fool. We moved into his turf, how could he allow us to get his shares? I am sorry to be late. Boss, what can I help you? Let me introduce, this is Liu, this is Giant. Master Ping, you should know him! Absolutely a handsome guy! It's a waste to be a rascal. You'll have better achievement if you become a pimp. Ping, come on! From now on, we are a family. Let's make our money together. My fellows will know what to do then. Don't harm our friendship. Family? Lately, I've recruited many fellows, I can't remember your name. What's you name? Giant! Giant? I am older than you, so, you are my son! Excuse me, my dad died long time ago. You've got poisonous lips, have you eaten shit? What's up? Ping, what drive you mad? Well, let's play mah-jong to enjoy ourselves. Otherwise, let's have a screw with some blondes. Uncle Chan, I am not interested in screwing blondes, I prefer screwing your mouth. What did you say? Sit down! What's up? How can you claim us as a family? I am just kidding with you! Kid, go home to play chess! Are you scared of playing mah-jong with us? Are you scared of being defeated? Isn't he that great in playing mah-jong? Let's play! You'd better watch out! Eat anything you want! But you'd remember! I'll get chance to win too. Well, how to settle the debt then? Although I am not your son, I want to share your wealth. I will take 20% from the net profit of the casino. Why don't you rob? Who do you think you are? You have no say here. If you don't give me a share when you run a business in Macau. I am sure you can't make any profit from it. I am sorry, my honey has made some dessert for me, I have to go home now. I am damn sure about Ping. He seems to be a care-free person, but he is a very cunning guy. He will never leave us alone. He is seeking chance to fix me. Get those bastards! See where have they gone! Boss... What's the matter? Happy Ghost has a car race with Lone, Lone lost, but he didn't want to pay. They argued and Lone started a fight. He means to trap us. How are our buddies. Three were hurt. Happy Ghost was seriously hurt, he broke his ribs and head. Give them a call. Yes. Boss... Brother Liu. So, you can move, that means you're alright. They were all armed to attack us. If I got a knife, I wouldn't let them go! I know you are tough! I'll name you "Knight of Courage", OK? You'd better name him "Knight of condom". Boss, we've got Ping. How is it, Master Ping, let's fix the case, OK? It's just conflict among the kids. Should we bosses negotiate for such peanut? Small conflict? They surrounded my men with weapons. It's only kids' fight! Just ask the kids to solve it among themselves. Don't harm our friendship, is that right? Alright, let's ask the kids to solve it among themselves. Go to eat shit! Master Ping, what shall we do? It's time to see his covered card. I want to uproot him and don't want to waste any more time. Do you think I am kind? I will let you see how tough I am! I gave him four choices. A, let's have a gang fight. The game will end if any five of each gang are killed. B, each side sends ten people for a gang fight, live or dead, it depends on their lucks. C, both side claim to be strong and powerful, Why not make a date to show our strength at the station. One uses the colour green, and the other uses the colour white. Let the kids fight among themselves. D, the two gangs fight for ten days. No matter live or dead, the fight will end after ten days. Suddenly I remembered that my mom's birthday will come two weeks later, I don't want the police to ruin her birthday party, so I shorten the period to 7 days. Just a cup of coffee! It's not a show. What a fine day! We just come out for a sun bath. Sun bath? I think it's a show! I am not match for you. Master Ping, you need not be that humble to me. How about the four suggestions that I offer? Nice coffee! Go ahead. Brother Liu, Ping's fellows are moving. Got you. Yeah, I've almost forgotten to tell you. My fellows want free fighting. They don't want to choose people to join the fighting game. And don't want to fight one to one. Just give them two week's time for fun, would you? You are sneaky to move quietly. Never mind, this is my respect. These two hours are free for you! Master Ping, what do you think? Damn it! Don't go! Don't go! It's Giant's fellow, kill them! Giant's fellow! Kill them! Brother Liu... Brother Liu... Cut the crap. Although we are not in the same gang, this time, you have my support. I'll give you a share if I get any profit. It's Ping. Speak up. Where are your fellows? Where have they gone? Do you want me to stop the race and let you recruit new men? Do you want to see my fellows? I will ask them to appear in your company! Boss, don't worry, we value quality but not quantity. He stabs us once, we will stab him three times! We are just waiting for your order! Right! Buddies, let's move! Got you. Let's go upstairs and talk. Sister-in-law... What's wrong with you? I ask you to gather men, but you go whoring! Sister-in-law, I am sorry to threaten your baby. Go! Let's find his car, let's go. What did you say? I can't hear clearly. Just do it, what do you think? You know my mom is on the phone, don't you? What? Go ahead. Just do what you said! Boss, three of our buddies got hurt in the casino. But we hurt three of their guys. Don't leave. Boss. Cheong, the left hand of Ping appears in the government office. Move. Send some cars to patrol on the island. Ping has a join there. Yes. Sister-in-law has given birth to a daughter! Really? Congratulations! Send some fellows to the hospital. I don't want Ping to bother my family. Yes. Why don't you visit your wife? She'll come out some days later. So I will see her then. That's right! It's messy now, so it's not convenient for you to show up. It's going to be alright. That bastard is good at playing tricks. They killed one and hurt eight of us during a raid. We won, but we lost many things instead. Many buddies are still lying in the hospital. So, you dare not go out, and you dare not visit your wife after her delivery. It's meaningless to win! Is that right? I won't give it a damn! Why do you sell your car? Are you going to finance one your brothers? We are brothers, I won't be that mean. The egg tart is still hot. Uncle Ken. This chip is not included. It'll stay with me until I die. I will leave it to you then. Cut the bull shit! You should be blamed. I thought you would treat me to shark-fins soup. But you offer me egg tart only! No special reasons. Like it, then eat it, like it, then do it. Most important of all is to make yourself happy. Uncle Ken, am I right? Sure, I always am happy. Remember? We had no money when we came here. We were damn hungry... when watching the egg tarts through the window. Of course I do, you said, if we make big money one day, we should open a cake shop. So we can eat as many egg tarts as we like. Alright, start from tomorrow morning. I want to open a dozen cake shops. We are fighting with our enemy, forget the cake shop! You drive me crazy! Get up! Let's go out for fun! Don't sleep too much! Or you'll have a pain in your ass! Can you make it? Sure! Haven't you been told by the doctor? I still have half year's time. Don't trust those creeps. Next week, I'll take you to America for special treatment. Pal, this is an incurable bronchial carcinoma. I can't be cured anyway. I said yes, then yes! Even Ping was terminated by us. What else can't we solve? I don't want to die abroad. I grew up here, all my buddies are here. Even I have to die, I want to die here. Don't give up. Half of our turfs belongs to you. Don't leave like this. I can't help you. I haven't given up. In fact, I haven't thought of enjoying long life as being a triad. I have tried all sorts of fine food and fine women. What else do I cherish? I am tried. Please fix it for me. That's it. Get him back if he isn't obedient. How is Liu? Nothing! I have to go now. You'd better sleep first. You go to sleep, I have to work, supposed you're used to that. Do you think I am used to that? Fix it! That's it! What did you say? I want to leave Macau. Where to go? It doesn't matter! I just don't want to stay here. Got you... I am having a meeting, stop bothering me! That's it. What trick do you want to play? If you don't have money, just speak up. Why did you bull shit? I am serious! I can't live here any more. If you aren't used to living here, let's move to some place else. Where? Can you move back to the old house? Do you have an adulterer? Who dares to seduce your woman? In Macau, is there anything which you don't know? Can anyone cheat you? You just don't know what has happened at home. You know how much I spend for incense per month? Nuts! It doesn't worth much! It's not a matter of money. The point is, why should I burn so much incense! You know, I worry so much when you leave home! I don't want to live in horrors. There is five million in the safe. Take it. Giant. Stop the nonsense. When I was in jail, you looked after my family. I did appreciate it. Now, we don't owe each other anything. Since you don't like to stay here, I won't force you. Leave if you like. Mr. Wan. Mr. Wan. Boss... Ping has been put to the dead end by us. You'd better not going out. Let's go for a walk, do you dare? It's going to be alright. It's going to be alright. He is still wearing the wedding ring. Isn't it a kind of decoration or isn't it something he can't forget? I didn't ask that question. By the way, affection is something they want to leave behind. Being a woman, when she stays with a triad boss, she may feel a sense of security. But, not ever lasting. Don't move! That's woman. Boss, there isn't any weapon on this woman. Send her to hospital. Send her to hospital at once! You seemed to be scared, didn't you? We always have to be cautious, everyone is self-minded and calculating. The casinos are gold mines to us, even you don't offend others, they will come to you. By the way, we are now involved in a battle. Do you think it's funny to be cautious of other's assassinations and tricks all day? It's not a matter of fun, this is the rule of the game. I can't help. Have you ever thought of stopping the battle? Starting a war is like starting the engine of a car. You stop supplying petroleum, it doesn't mean you can brake it. No one knows the outcome. Maybe, it will go on. The point is, who started the engine first. It's not me. It's him! Boss, you eat much lately. Sure, boss wastes time to do exercises every morning. He is muscular, you see? We should always be prepared to fight. Good health will bring you a sound mind. You should copy that. See my muscle! Happy Ghost, you look pale! I always do exercise, can't you see that? You mean doing exercise in bed? I heard you screwed Russian girls last night, one to five. How you know that? One to five? Can you make it? Don't go too far. Yes, boss. Yes, go ahead... got you! Chan is going to be the middle man. We'll meet Ping tomorrow. Negotiation? Why should we bargain? It must be use who scared the shit out of him, so he made Chan to be the middle man. Liu, what do you think? I just know that we must be the winner, never break even. You're right. We can make money together, but Ping always picks on us. Of course I do want to share the profit. We do our own business, but precaution is better than cure. Chan could help us, sure he can push us to dead end, he made us to become Ping's opponent, we can't say that he is using us, we are willing to be used, right? But if he wants to kick us away, it's not that easy. We are not nuts. Tomorrow, it would be a tough day. It's hard to predict the result. We should be well prepared. Liu, ask Ho to get everything ready, security first. Master Ping, Brother Lone. Sorry bosses, I am late. So, may I pay the bill? And I will treat you to have fun in the nightclub, OK? Let's have fun together, would you? Give way... Cut the crap, I just want to listen to your explanation. Explanation? You'd know the answer. I met severe traffic jam. We don't have MTR in Macau. I give you a quota of 60 million per month. But you met only 20 million this month. How much did you take from the profit? It's just a misunderstanding. I am not that kind of person. And your fellows, they always mess up in my casino. If these things go on, I'll give all your quota to him. Alright, you can blame me this time. So, we have nothing to say then? What do you want? Freeze! Shoot me if you have guts. Alright. I won't give it a damn! Shut up! What are you doing? I just want to scare you. Ping, are you crazy? You have no say here! You old bluffer! Sit down! What did you say? Sit down, you old bluffer! I tell you a secret. I really hate you! If I don't kill you, I wouldn't have a sound sleep tonight. Do you know what place it is? Shoot me if you have guts. If I haven't prepared well, I would not act. I wanna blow your head off and kick it to the sea. The cops won't even know it. Are you bluffing? Do you wanna try? Alright. I love gambling so much. The loser should claim himself a turtle. Hide up your toy gun. Can you hear me? Bastard! Don't move... Why gather so many people here? Someone reported a bomb found in the casino. We've just found one downstairs! So everyone should leave the place at once. Evacuate now! Buddies, search every inch of here. A bomb is found in the Casino, this is a very serious case. The boss need thorough investigation. Master Ping, don't go too far. Wait. Ping, it's out of our expectation. This time, you will become the turtle. This new hotel will be opened on Saturday. But the key person Mr. Lo Ping hasn't shown up yet. It's rumoured that, for the bloody incidents happened in Macau... someone contacted his allies in Hong Kong to send him assistance. There will be a troop of three to four hundred people. How is Liu? He's waiting for death. It's seems to be quiet. But I feel horror too. So you come a long way here to drink and tell me this shit? I heard that 2 gangs in Macau are preparing to start a war. They are ready to fight any time. So, many rascals hole up. They don't want to be killed by mistake. I think, the only way to solve the trouble is uprooting either one. Whoever blocks my way... whoever will be terminated. All rascals want to be the big boss. But it's dangerous to be on the top. You never know when you'll be killed by AK47. I don't think you've never worried about that. As being your friend, I would like to be frank, you've gone too far. Like playing poker. You are holding a chance and you push others to the dead end. You never give others a chance. If you don't make use of your chance, others won't be afraid. If you have no chips at hand, you can never bargain. Time is different now. Few years later, Macau would be reunified with China. It's not wise and it's not easy to live with an army. This is really great. You'd better buy more stocks. Why? I don't drink. I open it only when you come. I think I can't finish all these in ten years time. I wish I could drink free wine with you after ten years. Don't worry. I've to return three punches to you. I'll keep my life. The fortune teller said, the coming decade is the prime time of my life. I do hope so. You'd remember what you said. I am leaving, I want to sleep. You miss that again? Ping is a turtle! He hides up and waits for a chance. I would smash his place when I find it out. It's useless, he is protected! Quiet! We have to solve the financial problem first. Fisher Chan went back to Hong Kong. Now, the casinos are handled by Ping. He kicked all our buddies away. The couldn't make a living, their loyalty will be weakened. They will leave us sooner or later. Don't worry, we are righteous! We will all stay. We'll be all waiting for your call. Yes! Alright, you close my tap. I want to dry your reservoir. Get working! Yes! Kill him! Don't come to gamble again! Go! Don't ask! Go! What's the matter? Can you hear me? Go... I'll beat you up if I see you again. We stop his income, I guess, he is now acting like a mad dog. May be, he will hire some people to join this war. Well, we should act first. This is great! It helps sex. This one is even better. I mean oyster is great. You are flirt! What? Gentlemen, please follow me. Here we go... Please follow me. Come here, here are your keys. This is yours, and this is yours. Five Great! You lose this time. After getting rid of Ping's small potatoes, he is not able to fight. This time, we should uproot him by this chance. Kill him... What he hasn't known that, we are united, he thought he could bring me financial trouble, in fact, he is the biggest sufferer. He loaned 100 million to open a new hotel and casino, the interest rate is 3.75%. He'd pay 3 million monthly for interest, and 20 million for salary. And he has to pay the living for his "Friends". Both of you lost in the battle, don't you think it's worth? Will you drink when you feel thirsty? Will you go to sleep when you are sleepy? When you are hungry, will you go to eat? Don't ask me the matter of value. I know I must do that, that's it! Now, all the citizens are playing this game with you. It's messy every where, the citizens hate you most. What do you think? How do I know? If this matter affects their lives, What I've to say is being regret. Your buddies are hurt, you would avenge them. But if the citizen are hurt, do you think you'd be responsible for that? Mr. Wan, you haven't answered my question. Boss, be careful! Get in first. Boss... Stop chasing. Send boss to the hospital first. Be quick... What's up? Why haven't you got the bastard? How did boss treat you? Be smart and get it done quickly If you can't find the bastard, you'd disappear at once. Brother Liu, take a rest. I'll take care of this place, don't worry. Information Bureau. We want a statement from our boss. Damn it! Boss hasn't waken up yet, no one is allowed to go in. Boss is shot, we don't know who did it yet. And we don't know whether he is alive or not. None of my business! I didn't say it's related to you. I just come for a statement. Who are you? What's the matter? Brother Liu. We come to take a statement for boss, We are instructed by our boss, don't give us hard time. Would you co-operate with us? Cut the crap! I'll go in and shoot him! It will save your trouble! What are you playing? Shut up! Listen? Stop! Leave now, or I can't stop him! Go! Shut up! What's the matter? What's the matter? Boss... What's up? His heart's stopped! Call the doctor! Call the doctor! Boss, you'd hang on. Hang on! Let me do it. Speak up. Master Ping, he's over. That's great! We've got his where about. Brother Liu, this is Kwong. We've got Ping's where about. He is now in Chuk-wan. Funny, gather all your fellows. Yes. Ho, take care of boss. Yes. Master Ping. Cheers. From now on, Macau will be ours. Never mind! The citizen's happiness would be most important! So they can gamble and whore. So my words are right. Master Ping, here comes Big Head. Ask that bastard to come in, he wants the money only. Big Head, come in! He's out there. Congratulations! Master Ping, congratulations! What for? Do you think this is a new year? I feel happier than the new year, cause I'll get a big red pocket. Did I owe you debt? Take a seat. One of two million is nothing to you. Shit! What's the matter? Liu is leading a gang here. They are closing. Damn it! How can they know our place? We have just killed Giant. Liu must be crazy for that. Giant was killed. We need not give it a damn! Get our weapons. Yes, Master Ping. The police has come the right time. They are ill-fated! How dare they attempt to invade us. Get lost! What are you doing? Don't worry about him. Hold it. I'm Happy Ghost try get me. I'll shoot you. I don't care about the gun. Back off... So many people gather here, do you want to start a war? Yeah, we want to start a war. We can afford that! Let's go up and talk. Follow me. Yes, Officer To. Do you want to start a war? I'll let you fight upstairs. Shut up! Damn you! You'd better get lost, don't stop us from working. Let me do it! Listen. Tell the boys out there. We have orders... Whoever moves will be shot at once. We are instructed by our seniors to kill! Fatty, do you want to bluff me? Come on! Bastard! Do you want to mess up here? Fatty. Come on. Follow me. Ask them not to lose their mind! Stay calm! If they don't hand that bastard to me, I will uproot his base. I won't give face to police either. Get lost. You're put at the dead end. Don't move, stay back. Officer To, you've come the right time. This bastard brings his fellows to mess up here, arrest him now. Drag all the small potatoes away. Go... Go downstairs. You too! Go! You are small potato! Get the ass out of here! Sit down. We are colleagues! I know you are from the Information Bureau. I know what you have done. You'd handle your own business, I don't care. I am leaving. Sit down. You too. Sit. Giant was killed. I don't think Macau would be peaceful without seeing a massacre. The government doesn't want it to happen before the unification. So, we have an order. Whoever messes up in Macau would be killed. We won't give anyone face. So, I don't care what way you are using to suppress this mess. If you can't solve it peacefully, I'll fix it. Officer To, what's up? Shut up! Watch them. How is it, Brother Liu, how to solve it? Solve it? Either you solve it yourself, or, I'll terminate you. Who do you think you are? What? First, I know it's you who sent your hotel in order to frame us. Second, you are the man behind to assassin Giant. Yeah, so what? So, I want to terminate your gang now! You paid two million to kill Giant, I can afford paying 5 million to bribe them to fix you! Master Ping, not such thing, don't listen to those bull shit! Shut up! Do you think it's you who ordered to kill Giant! In fact, it's me! If no being helped by Brother Fo, I couldn't have become the boss. If not were him, how could I know your whereabouts? You deckhand! No... If you kill him now, you can get my 5 million and flee away. Master Ping, no! It's not true! Go to hell, you betrayer! Don't move... Hands up! Officer To, he killed. How dare you kill a cop! You're in real trouble! Cuff him! It's because of self defence. If doesn't matter! Whatever you say. We'll see how the judge will say. Cuff him too. Go! Let's go. Coming... You bastard... Many people is here, don't let him do it. Take him away. Yes sir. Get in. Here we are. Get rid of it, why do you mask my face? Where are you taking me to? Giant? Everything is arranged by me! I trapped you to kill that cop. Do you know what this is? A bullet proof vest! This is a bug specially for tracing mobile phone. I place my buddies at every comers of Macau. When your stupid fellow called you, I could trace you at once! So, what do you say? You are really something! You're smart! What do you want? I want you life. My life is right here, come get it. I don't believe that you won't be afraid of death. Please let me go! Just kill me if you want! Cut the bull shit! Do you want me to beg for mercy, stop dreaming! I would like to see whether you are a real brave guy or not. Lo Ping, I admire your guts. I tell you, you can never make a living in Macau. It's no said by the God. But I do, I don't let you stay. I will let you go now. But, if anyone mention your name again, I'd kill him without mercy. I won't give you boat. I don't care whether you dive or walk. Listen, never let me see you show up in Macau again! You let me go but I would not say thank you. Go for fun! Master Ping, bon voyage! Liu, Liu, hang on! Hang on! I can manage! We got the turf by our own hands. So, I would hang on. Liu, stop saying anything, but you'd hang on. We'll reach the hospital soon. In these years... e have passed a tough way. But with you, a trustable buddy! Come on! We are buddies, everything is understand. Liu! Giant! From now on, you'll in-charge of Macau. Take good care of it. In fact, this is a well-planned trap! Since I walked out from the house, you've arranged everything. If the car isn't powerful enough, it isn't qualified to join the race. Same as human beings. This is gold mine. No matter what, many people come here with different dreams. This must be a very attractive interview. But I started to feel that, this kingpin, apparently hot-tempered and gallant, behind him, his is very much different from what we have seen. Maybe, you can say... this is a hero in the trouble world. You are really tough. If you missed something, you would have been finished. When you join the race, you'd be prepared for the crash. If you have too many worries, you'd better quit. How about meeting accident? If you were scared, you wouldn't have come to this interview. After this interview, you'd be promoted. Last question. A tough kingpin has gone, in fact, you're another tough kingpin. I'm, but I'm a reasonable one. Are you sure Macau would not be messy again? There must be conflicts in places where you can make money. The point is, you don't know next one would be another kingpin, or your partner, or your buddy... In fact, have you ever been afraid? Have you felt lonely? Someone described this guy as a hero. But someone said he is hard-hearted and tough. I've been knowing him for just few days, my deepest impression is, a hero is still a man. Behind his toughness, he isn't different from anyone else. But, he has a sense of loss. He can't live like ordinary people. Because the trouble world would never become peaceful. Danger would always be with you. Bye bye. In places where you can make money, you'll find conflicts. The point is, you don't know whether you next competitor... is another kingpin, or your partner, or your buddy.
