OKAY, I HAD THAT ALL TAKEN CARE OF. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO E-MAIL YOU YOUR BOARDING PASS? THAT WOULD BE OUTSTANDING. THANK YOU. CAN I HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING ELSE? THAT'LL SUFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD DAY. THAT IS A BIG FIRE. WHAT IS GOING ON IN ATLANTA TODAY? - NEGATIVE ENERGY? - VOODOO. IT WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT TO BE CARGO, BUT IT IS NOW CONFIRMED TO HAVE BEEN A PASSENGER FLIGHT. THE FLIGHT WAS BOUND FOR CHICAGO. - FROM THE LOOKS OF THE SITE... - TURN THAT UP. IT'S NOT LIKELY ANYONE SURVIVED. AGAIN, IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXPRESS AMERICA FLIGHT 0729 FROM ATLANTA TO CHICAGO O'HARE HAS CRASHED JUST AFTER TAKEOFF. WE'RE EXPECTING A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH AVIATION OFFICIALS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR. - ABOUT A DOZEN DOWNTOWN... - THAT WAS MY FLIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? CAN YOU JUST DROP ME OFF AT AVIS? THAT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD. NO ONE SURVIVED THAT. WAKE UP, NICK. I'M HERE. I'M NAUSEOUS. I'M NAUSEOUS. I FEEL LIKE SHIT. I FEEL LIKE SHIT. CAN YOU PLEASE NOT? JUST GOT HERE. YOU WERE GONNA WAIT UP FOR ME, REMEMBER? HMM? HMM? COME ON. I'M SLEEPING ON THE COUCH. YOU CAN STAY HERE. WHAT A SURPRISE! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FOR? FOR THAT? AND FOR ANYTHING SIMILAR YOU MAY HAVE PLANNED. I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR THE PASTURE. - WHAT'S UP, JEFFY? - YO! LONG TIME NO TALK. HOW YOU BEEN? GOOD. GOOD, JUST DOING THE WORK THING, HANGING OUT. I SCORED A BLOCK OF TICKETS FOR THE MICHIGAN MICHIGAN STATE GAME. YOU NEED TO COME TO ANN ARBOR. YOU KNOW WHAT... WORKS BEEN HECTIC, I DON'T THINK I CAN BREAK AWAY. THAT'S THE BEST REASON. DUDE, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BEEN OVERWHELMING. COME ON! WE'LL ALL GET LAID. IT'LL BE LIKE OLD TIMES. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GETTING LAID. OH, BULLSHIT! THAT WAS ROY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM. I'LL SCREEN HIM. YOU KNOW, I'M IN. I'M IN, BUT YOU TELL ROY NO DISCO SHIT. EXCELLENT. SEE YOU FRIDAY, MOFO. FUCK YOU! HEY, ROY. NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GET THE BURDEN AGAIN. WELL, I'M NOW UP TO THAT CHALLENGE. OH, YEAH! THESE COLLEGE GIRLS ARE GONNA BE BEATING DOWN YOUR DOOR. MAN, I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THE BURDEN. THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU AND THIS GUY RIGHT HERE NEVER WENT A DAY WITHOUT GETTING LAID. DIDN'T YOU HAVE THE BURDEN - FOR ALMOST YOUR ENTIRE SOPHOMORE YEAR? - NO! IT WAS JUST A SEMESTER. IT'S NOT THAT LONG. IT'S NOT THAT LONG. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE CALLED IT THAT. THAT'S A FUCKED UP WEIGH TO MEASURE YOURSELF. OH, LIKE YOU STILL DON'T. MM. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M DONE. I'M GONNA GET UP EARLY, I'M GONNA RALLY. SO, GENTLEMEN. THAT'S A GOOD CALL. YOU GUYS HEADING BACK? UH, NO, WE'RE GOOD FOR ONE MORE. I'LL SEE YOU BACK THERE. - ALL RIGHT. - THE BURDEN! MM. YOU LOOK FRIED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE HERE, BUT YOU'RE NOT HERE. NO, IT'S ALL GOOD. OKAY. I MEAN, YOU'RE AN INVESTMENT BANKER. WHAT'D YOU THINK, CHEERLEADERS? HELLO? SORRY. IT'S NOT JUST WORK. MM, BUT THE MONEY. YEAH. YEAH, IT'S JUST... I FEEL TRAPPED UNDER THIS CRUSHING DARKNESS, AND IT'S JUST... NEVER MIND. WHAT ABOUT JANICE? SHE'S A TROPHY. NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I WON. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO COMMUNICATION. AND I'M PRETTY SURE SHE FUCKS AROUND AS MUCH AS I DO. HMM. NOT CERTAIN THAT'S THE GOAL FOR A RELATIONSHIP, BUT IF IT'S WORKING FOR YOU GUYS. JUST ANOTHER LINK I ADDED TO THE CHAIN. THEN END IT. I LIKE HER. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I MEAN, SHE'S NOT BAD TO BRING TO A CLIENT OUTING. SHE'S FUNNY, A GREAT FUCK, BUT SHE'S GOT THE DEPTH OF A KIDDIE POOL. LIKE US. WE JUST FEEL A NEED FOR EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW. MORE NOW. AND I, UM, THINK THERE'S MORE TO THIS. HEY. LET'S GO SIT OVER HERE. THANKS. I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN LIKE A MONTH. I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M LEAKING ENERGY ALL THE TIME, AND IT'S BEING REPLACED WITH NOTHING. ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE? - HELP YOU SORT THINGS OUT. - OH, YEAH. ALCOHOL AND AMBIEN. SO YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF. CALL HER. YOU'LL BE GLAD. AND WHAT IF I DON'T DO A THERAPIST? SHE'S IVY LEAGUES. SMART, KAREN LOVED HER. SHE'S A BIT UNORTHODOX. UNORTHODOX? LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS SHE DID MIRACULOUS THINGS FOR KAREN. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU DESCRIBE ONE OF THESE MIRACLES? YOU KNOW HOW SHE USED TO GET PISSED - AND BE FUCKING NUTS? - OH, YEAH. IT'S FIXED. DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE. HMM. I'LL SEE. YOU HAVE A SOLUTION. - HEY! - GEEZ! I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN ANN ARBOR. - I'M BACK. - I SEE THAT. HOW WAS IT? DID YOU SCORE SOME COEDS? I DIDN'T SCORE ANYTHING. SHOT DOWN, TOO BAD. - I DIDN'T TRY. - REALLY? REALLY. SO YOU'RE FINALLY REALIZING WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT HERE. DON'T GET CRAZY. ASSHOLE. I'M GOING TO SOUTH BEACH THIS WEEKEND. OH. WHO YOU GOING WITH? ONE OF THE OTHER GIRLS FROM JIMMY CHOO IS TAKING ME. SHE MUST SELL A HELL OF A LOT MORE SHOES THAN YOU DO. FUNNY. SHE GOT INVITED BY SOME GUY THAT CAME IN BUYING SHOES FOR HIS WIFE. ISN'T THAT WHY YOU GUYS ALL WORK THERE? ACCESS TO RICH MARRIED GUYS. IT'S A PERK. AND WHY ARE YOU GOING? SHE NEEDS PROTECTION. - FROM WHAT? - HERSELF. SOUNDS LIKE GREAT FUN. OH, NICE SHADES. YOU GOING TO WELDING CLASS? I CAN'T HAVE ANYBODY KNOW WHERE I'M LOOKING, NOW CAN I? I'LL BE THERE. NICK? - DOCTOR DUMONT. - OH. I'D PREFER KATRINA. COME ON IN. HAVE A SEAT, NICK. MM-HMM. WHAT'S GOING ON? NOT REALLY SURE. YOUR FRIEND RECOMMENDED ME? YEAH. HIS WIFE WAS A PATIENT. WERE YOU LOOKING FOR A RECOMMENDATION? NOT REALLY. SO HE JUST OFFERED UP THIS RECOMMENDATION UNSOLICITED, HUH? THAT'S RIGHT. AND WHAT GAVE HIM REASON TO DO THAT? I WASN'T MYSELF. HE NOTICED. WELL, LET'S START WITH WHO HE THINKS YOU ARE. UH, THE GUY WHO GETS PROMOTED THE FASTEST. UH, THE GUY WHO MAKES THE BIGGEST BONUSES, WHO HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIENDS. GIRLFRIENDS PLURAL. MM-HMM. THESE PLURALITIES IN SUCCESSION OR SIMULTANEOUS? BOTH. AND HOW DO THEY FEEL? I'M NOT REALLY SURE. DO THEY KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER? SOME FIGURE IT OUT. I THINK GUILT'S NOT REALLY A CONDITION I SUFFER FROM. WHAT BECOMES OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS? SOME TURN INTO MEANINGFUL FRIENDSHIPS. AND THE OTHERS? HOOK UPS. INTERMITTENT ONGOING SEX. NONEXCLUSIVE INTERMITTENT ONGOING SEX? SURE. YEAH. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE REWARD IS NOVELTY AND INFIDELITY? THAT'S THE IDEA GOING IN. AND DO YOU LOOK AT THESE GIRLS THE WAY YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME, LIKE A GOAL RATHER THAN A CONNECTION? I SUPPOSE. GOOD TO KNOW. WHAT DO YOU FEEL BETWEEN THESE SEXUAL CONQUESTS? WELL, DEEPER TRUTHS DON'T SCREAM AT US, NICK. THEY WHISPER. SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL EMPTY AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY, SO THEY USE TO FILL THAT NEED. HUMANS NEED A CONNECTION. TO THEIR INNER SELVES, TO THE SOUL. AND WHEN THEY DON'T GET IT THAT EMPTINESS SEEKS STIMULATION AND THE STIMULATION BECOMES LIKE A RUSH. AND YOU CAN BECOME ADDICTED TO THE RUSH. NO. - WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS JUST... - IS A HIGH. LIKE A HEROIN ADDICT, WHO'S JUST LOOKING FOR HIS NEXT FIX. SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? IF YOU'RE WILLING, WE CAN DO SOME WORK AND DISCOVER. MAYBE WHAT THAT NEED IS THE LINK TO THE EMPTINESS. MM. - REALLY? - MM-HMM. WHAT? NOTHING. I CAN FEEL YOU STARING. MAYBE LOOK THEN? I'M LOOKING. GOOD. WHY ARE YOU STILL STARING AT ME? I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY GOOD REASON. WE'RE IN THE SAME ROOM, NICK. THE BEDROCK OF A RELATIONSHIP. A COMMON SPACE. HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE IN THE SAME SPACE AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE'RE A PRODUCT OF TIME AND SPACE. WORKED FOR YOU LAST NIGHT. GLAD I COULD ACCOMMODATE YOU. - IT WASN'T JUST CONVENIENCE. - WHAT WAS IT THEN? I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING AN EFFORT. DON'T THINK, NICK. YOU MAKE THINGS WEIRD. MOSTLY I TRY TO COME UP WITH WAYS THAT WOULD LOOK ACCIDENTAL. WHO YOU TRYING TO PROTECT? IS IT YOUR REPUTATION? MY PARENTS WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THEIR SON COULD BE SO CRIPPLED WITH DEPRESSION THAT HE'D KILL HIMSELF. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE WOULD CARE. WHAT ABOUT JANICE? SHE'D BE DEVASTATED WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE LOST THE USE OF THE FITNESS CLUB IN MY CONDO BUILDING. MAYBE YOU UNDERESTIMATE HER. WE HAVE A MUTUALLY BENEFICIALLY ARRANGEMENT. HAVE YOU TRIED TALKING TO HER? IT'S POINTLESS. THERE'S NO CONNECTION, NO ENERGY EXCHANGE. AH, INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS. ENERGY. I'M RUNNING OUT OF IT. MADE IT A MILE AND A HALF ON MY RUN TODAY. I FANTASIZED ABOUT DROWNING MYSELF. AND HONESTLY, THESE SESSIONS HAVE BEEN LIKE A WARM SHOWER. AND THAT GOOD FEELING AFTERWARDS, IT WEARS OFF QUICK. I'D LIKE TO START YOU ON REGRESSION THERAPY. I THINK THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY TRADITIONAL THERAPY AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS DON'T WORK. OKAY. I THINK THERE COULD BE A TRAUMA IN YOUR PAST THAT'S BLOCKING YOU PSYCHOLOGICALLY. WE ALL HAVE TRAUMA. YOU GET OVER IT, YOU MOVE ON. YEAH. SOME DO. AND SOME CREATE A VOID. I THINK IF WE WERE TO USE REGRESSION TECHNIQUES ON YOU, I THINK YOU COULD FIND MAYBE SOMETHING THAT'S RELEVANT TO YOUR DEPRESSION. SEEMS A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT FOR ME. THINK ABOUT IT. OKAY? - YEAH? - -DABNEY WINTERS FROM "THE TIMES" IS ON THREE. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A MESSAGE. HE SAID HE HAD A CALL SCHEDULED ON THE THERMSTER IPO STORY. IS HE IN THE CALENDAR? - YES. - SHIT. TELL HIM I'LL CALL HIM BACK LATER. OKAY. HEY, RIDGE. HEY! YOU BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS? JUST GETTING THROUGH THE PLASTIC CONVERSION PORTION. I'M UP TO MY ELBOWS IN TRASH CONVERSION. - IF THIS WORKS LIKE THEY SAY... - IT'S GONNA BE BIGGER THAN GOOGLE'S IPO. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SHIT TONS OF MONEY. EMAIL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS, I HAVE A PHONE CALL WITH THEIR RESEARCH TEAM LATER. - YOU GOOD? - YEAH. YEAH. THERE'S A BUNCH OF SCIENCE BURIED INTO THIS SHIT. I'M ANYTHING, BUT A SCIENTIST. YOU BETTER BE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON WHEN WE TALK TO THE INVESTORS. - GOTTA BE ON OUR "A" GAME. - AREN'T WE ALWAYS? WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE? HMM? THAT'S GREAT. IS IT TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING? NOT ENOUGH OF EVERYTHING? MM. TURN AROUND. WERE YOU HOPING TO SHOW MORE ASS OR LESS BOOB? OR VICE VERSA? I FORGET. I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH BUTT. YOU CAN'T USE THE OTHER BOTTOMS WITH THIS TOP? - VERY HELPFUL. - WAIT A MINUTE. ONE MINUTE I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT MY THERAPY AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW I'M JUDGING YOUR ASS TO BOOB EXPOSURE RATIOS. WELL, THERE HAS TO BE SOME MYSTERY. I CAN'T SHOW IT ALL AT ONCE. IT'S A FUCKING BIKINI. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. YOU COULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE. YOU'RE RIGHT. I COULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE. IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A BITCH. WHATEVER COMES TO MIND, JUST ACCEPT IT AND EXPERIENCE IT. OKAY? THERE'S NO VALUE IN ANALYZING THIS IN REAL TIME. OKAY, LET'S BEGIN. OKAY, EXHALE. DEEP BREATH IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE. OUT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH. GOOD. I WANT YOU TO SEE LIGHT ALL AROUND YOU. AS I COUNT DOWN I WANT YOU TO RELEASE YOUR LIMITATIONS THAT YOUR MIND HAS ON YOUR GIVEN MEMORY. TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN. YOU FEEL THE LIGHT ILLUMINATING. SIX, FIVE. DEEPER NOW. FOUR, THREE... YOU HAVE A CATALOG OF ALL OF YOUR MEMORIES. YOU NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. MY HANDS ARE SO COLD. GO, NICK! HOLD TIGHT. LET'S GO, NICK. COME ON, NICK. YOU HAVE TO DO IT. LET'S GO, NICK. COME ON, NICK. WHY ARE YOU HERE? I HAVE TO FEEL HER APPROVAL. BOTH HANDS, NICK. COME ON. ONE MORE RING. YOU DID IT! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. OKAY, I'M GONNA BRING YOU BACK NOW. LISTEN TO MY VOICE. YOU'RE MY LITTLE GUY. THE LIGHT IS DIMMING. GENTLY COMING BACK. FEEL YOUR FINGERS AND YOUR TOES. FEEL THE ROOM THAT WE'RE IN. HEAR MY VOICE. WELCOME BACK, NICK. HOW DO YOU FEEL? I JUST HAD TO FEEL. FEEL... FEEL WHAT? HER APPROVAL. WHY WAS IT SPECIFIC TO THAT EVENT? IT WAS THE LAST TIME SHE EVER SHOWED IT. RIGHT. HOW WAS THE EXPERIENCE? INCREDIBLE. I MEAN... I HAD THE... THE REALIZATION, THE CLARITY. WHAT KIND OF CLARITY? IT WAS LIKE THE... THE THOUGHTS AND THE... THE IMAGES WERE JUST FLOWING IN. WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS? LIKE I'M ON A TREADMILL. AH. RIGHT. EFFORT WITHOUT PROGRESS. EVER SINCE THAT MOMENT IT'S JUST BEEN A CHASE. FOR SUCCESS, FOR PRAISE, APPRECIATION. THAT WAS FOR A MINUTE. AND HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO YOU RIGHT NOW? IT'S NEVER-ENDING. I JUST... I END UP ALONE. STILL CHASING. AND HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THAT END? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S... IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME. AH! I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU DEEPER. YOU ARE IN A VERY FERTILE AREA AND YOU'RE JUST AT THE MARGIN. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO BE OPEN TO SOME OTHER TECHNIQUES. ACCEPTING OF THIS, OKAY? LIKE? I NEED YOU TO BE PREPARED, BECAUSE IT CAN GET VERY COLD AND DARK. BUT IT'S PART OF THE HEALING. OKAY. OKAY. KATRINA THINKS THAT I CREATE A FALSE INTIMACY AND I PRAC... WHY DO YOU SEE HER? IT'S ALL PSYCHOBABBLE. IT'S SO FUCKING BORING. WOW! I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT MY WELL-BEING. DON'T BE A CRYBABY. THESE ARE FOR THE POOL. WHERE ARE YOU GOING AGAIN? YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME AND I'M SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO YOU? SOUTH BEACH. WITH EVA AND HER FRIEND FROM THE STORE. - FOR PROTECTION? - WHAT ELSE? I DON'T KNOW. JEALOUS? UM... NO. MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WELL, WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT, FUCKING, WHEN YOU DON'T, I GO SHOPPING. I'M THE ONLY GUY IN THE WORLD THAT PAYS FOR NOT HAVING SEX. SOME GENIUS BANKER YOU ARE. OKAY, UM, I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO SUSPEND YOUR CURRENT BELIEF SYSTEM. SO THAT WE CAN WORK ON GOING FURTHER BACK. FURTHER BACK WHERE? I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST INCARNATION. I'VE TAKEN MANY PEOPLE THROUGH PAST LIFE REGRESSION. WHAT HAPPENED TO TAPPING INTO MY SUBCONSCIOUS MEMORY? I THINK THAT THEY'RE PAST TRAUMAS FROM THOSE PRIOR LIVES THAT ARE CAUSING YOUR DEPRESSION. I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL BULLSHIT ON THAT. WELL, THAT'S WHY I ASK YOU TO WORK ON BEING OPEN AND RECEPTIVE. - YEAH, OPEN IS ONE THING. - OPEN IS EVERYTHING. IF YOU'RE AFRAID OR NOT READY, I UNDERSTAND THAT, TOO. I TAKE IT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE STEPPING INTO THE UNORTHODOX REALM. YES, THAT WOULD BE THIS THRESHOLD. OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR PITCH? THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS. THERE'S THE CONSCIOUS MIND, THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, AND THE SUPERCONSCIOUS MIND. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON A LONG DRIVE AND YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE YOU HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THE LAST 30 MINUTES? - OF COURSE. - YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS THE CONSCIOUS MIND DOING THE THINKING, THEN YOU HAVE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND. IT'S DOING THE DRIVING, THE BREATHING, ALL THE FUNCTIONS, AND SAVING THE MEMORY OF ALL THE LOST TIME. WHAT MEMORY? I THOUGHT THE TIME IS BLANK. WELL, THE TIME IS BLANK, BUT THE MEMORY IS SAVED. NOW, THE SUPERCONSCIOUS MIND, THIS IS YOUR VIRTUAL HARD DRIVE. YOUR STORAGE CENTER FOR ALL OF YOUR MEMORIES, YOUR WISDOM FROM YOUR PAST LIFE EXPERIENCES. THE CLOUD? YEAH, OR SOME CALL IT THE SOUL. IT WAS THERE LONG BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. IT WILL BE THERE LONG AFTER THIS CONSCIOUS MIND AND BODY DIE. THINK OF THIS AS A PAST LIFE ARCHEOLOGY. WE CAN ACCESS ALL OF YOUR SOUL MEMORIES WITH HYPNOTIC REGRESSION. FIND THE PAST LIFE TRAUMAS THAT ARE AFFECTING YOU TODAY, LEADING TO YOUR DEPRESSION. I MEAN, AM I REALLY THAT DESPERATE TO BE BUYING INTO THIS SHIT? OKAY, LET ME TRY ANOTHER WAY WITH YOU. SIT DOWN. IS IT CRAZY WHEN I BLOW A DOG WHISTLE THAT THE DOG HEARS IT CLEARLY AND WE CAN'T HEAR IT? OR A BEE, HOW IT FINDS ITS NECTAR USING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT THAT'S NOT ON OUR VISIBLE SPECTRUM? I DON'T SEE HOW THAT PERTAINS TO ANY OF THIS. WHAT ABOUT RADIO WAVES OR TELEVISION SIGNALS, WiFi? THINGS THAT WE CAN'T... I MEAN, DO ANY OF YOUR FIVE SENSES PICK THOSE THINGS UP? OF COURSE NOT. SO ISN'T IT ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT WE EXPERIENCE ONLY A NARROW SLIVER OF OUR REALITY AND THERE ARE OTHER ENERGIES AND PHENOMENON THAT WE CAN'T SENSE? OKAY, LET'S START LIKE A REGULAR SESSION. ALL THE DARKNESS IN THE WORLD CAN HELP BRING OUT THE LIGHT OF A SINGLE STAR. MASTER, PLEASE HAVE MERCY! COMBA. COMBA, STAY WITH ME. TAKE MY HAND. TAKE IT. TAKE MY HAND. - I WANNA TOUCH YOU WHEN I PASS ON... - NO. TO THE OTHER SIDE. DON'T YOU TALK LIKE THAT. DON'T YOU GO NOWHERE. COMBA, YOU GONNA STAY WITH ME. YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. MASTER GONNA HELP US. COMBA. NO. COMBA. COMBA. LET'S GO TO ONE MORE PLACE. COMING BACK GENTLY. SLOWLY LET GO. BREATHE. TWO. GOOD. ONE. WHAT ARE YOU FEELING? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE SOME BIZARRE, FAMILIAR DREAM PIPED IN. IT'S NOT A DREAM, IT'S EXPERIENCES. YOUR EXPERIENCES. IT'S VIVID. SO WHAT DID RE-EXPERIENCING ALL THESE SHOW YOU? WHAT WAS THE ESSENCE? I WAS ANGRY AND FULL OF HATE WHEN COMBA DIED. IT CONSUMED ME. SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY? I COULD'VE FOLLOWED COMBA'S EXAMPLE. AND APPRECIATED HOW LOVE GAVE US THE MOMENTS TO ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF OUR DAILY LIVES. A SINGLE LIGHT IN A SEA OF DARKNESS. THIS LOOKS GREAT. WHAT IS THIS? - NOT GOOD. - YEAH, BUT DETAILS WOULD BE GOOD. IT SHOWED UP IN AN ANONYMOUS E-MAIL. IT'S WORRYING. THE CLAIM IS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE NONPLASTIC CONVERSION TO CLEAN ENERGY WON'T BE READY FOR ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS. FUCK ME. ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN, IT'S RIGHT THERE, MAN. YOU CAN READ IT YOURSELF. IS THE POWERPOINT DATED? MAYBE IT'S OLD. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE BLOW THIS UP HERE, WE'RE GONNA BE LIVING OUT OF OUR CARS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET GRIMES IN ON THIS NOW. HE'S A FUCKING CLOWN CAR THAT GUY. HE'S ALSO THE DE FACTO CEO OF THIS WHOLE LITTLE OPERATION OF OURS. HE'S GONNA GO BATSHIT. GRIMES. WHAT'S UP? ROBERT, WE MADE A DISCOVERY ON THE THERMSTER DEAL. A DISCOVERY. WHAT KIND OF DISCOVERY? THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE NONPLASTIC CONVERSION MAY BE IMMATURE. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN IMMATURE? MAYBE A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM BEING READY. OH, NO, NO, NO. TELL ME THIS IS SOME KIND OF FUCKING JOKE, NICK! NOT A JOKE. I'LL BE THERE IN THREE HOURS. YOU BE IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM AND YOU BE READY TO FIX THIS SHIT. I'D SAY HE TOOK THAT PRETTY WELL. ALL RIGHT. FIRST WE NEED TO FIND OUT IF SOMEONE'S TRYING TO FUCK US OR FUCK THEM, BECAUSE THIS... THIS IS CLEARLY NOT WHAT THEY PRESENTED TO US INITIALLY. YES, LOOKS LIKE SOME R&D REPORT FOR INTERNAL USE. PROPERLY SENT BY SOME DISGRUNTLED SHIT HEAD. I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IS PRESENT ALL THIS TO ROGAN, LET HIM EXPLAIN IT. IF HE ALREADY LIED, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE'S GONNA HAVE SOME KIND OF COME TO JESUS MOMENT WITH YOU? I CAN REACH OUT TO ONE OF MY MARKETING FRIENDS. NO, FUCK THAT. HE WON'T KNOW SHIT. OKAY. YOU CALL THIS LITTLE PRICK. WITHOUT ACTUALLY ACCUSING HIM OF ANYTHING, GET AN EXPLANATION ON THIS. TEN YEARS BUILDING THIS FIRM, FINALLY READY TO MAKE OUR FIRST BIG MOVE. FUCKERS! DO NOT FUCK THIS UP. YOU KEEP ASKING AND ASKING AND ASKING. I'M TELLING YOU, I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. WHAT'S STOPPING YOU FROM BELIEVING WHAT YOU SAW? ME BEING A SLAVE MAKES NO SENSE. THE SOUL IS DEFINED BY THE LEVEL OF AWARENESS, NOT BY RACE OR GENDER. SOME PAST LIFE EXPERIENCES ARE REAL, AND SOME ARE HALLUCINATORY METAPHORS CREATED BY THE SUBCONSCIOUS. OH, SO MAYBE IT'S A METAPHOR FOR MY ADDICTIONS. MAYBE. YOU READY? WHAT ARE YOU ARGUING ABOUT? SHE SAYS THAT I WORK TOO MUCH AND THAT THERE'S NO TIME LEFT FOR US. WHAT ARE YOU TELLING HER? THAT EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR HER. SO WE CAN HAVE THESE THINGS. I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU BACK NOW, NICK. LISTEN TO MY WORDS. SLOWLY BREATHING. FEELS GOOD. EXHALE. ONE. YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE HERE WITH ME. IT'S OKAY. I LEFT THEM WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE. I DIED PROTECTING A FEW DOLLARS. MOST FORMS OF SUFFERING COME FROM ATTACHMENT. WITH TANYA IT WAS ATTACHMENT TO ANGER AND HATRED. WITH PIETRO, IT'S ATTACHMENT TO GREED. THESE ARE NEGATIVE VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES FATHERED BY THE EGO. THIS CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE. IT'S NOT COINCIDENCE. COMBA, ALLASANDRA. THE FEELING IS JUST... LISTEN. DO YOU SPEAK ITALIAN? WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? HEY. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WHY HAVEN'T YOU RETURNED MY TEXT? I'VE BEEN BUSY. PHONE OFF BUSY. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM DOUG ROGAN? NOT YET. BUT IT'S SATURDAY. GUESS WHO DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT. GRIMES. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU. HE THINKS YOU GOT YOUR HEAD UP YOUR ASS OR SOMEONE ELSE'S ASS. I'M FINE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, WELL YOU BETTER FIND ROGAN OR GRIMES IS GONNA BLOW A NECK ARTERY. FIRST THING MONDAY. JUST GIVE ME TILL FIRST THING MONDAY. THAT'S HOW IT WAS WITH COMBA AND ALLASANDRA. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF WHEN YOU WERE WITH THEM? HMM. I DON'T KNOW. UM... CONNECTED. - AUTHENTIC LOVE. - EXACTLY. YOU EXPERIENCED AN ETERNAL PARTNER, A SOUL MATE. SOUL MATE. YEAH, RIGHT OUT OF A CHEESY ROMANTIC NOVEL. SOUL MATES RADIATE AT A SIMILAR FREQUENCY. SO WHEN YOU BRUSH UP AGAINST ONE IT FOSTERS AN INEXPLICABLE HARMONY. LIKE A MUSICAL SCORE WHERE EACH NOTE SUPPORTS THE NEXT. THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT WE EACH HAVE A LIFE BLUEPRINT. IT INCLUDES OUR SOUL MATES, OUR KARMIC LEARNING EXPERIENCES. NOTHING'S PREORDAINED. EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO FREE CHOICE. DOESN'T FREE CHOICE OVERRULE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING? YES, IT CAN, BUT YOU KNOW THOSE ODD COINCIDENCES AND CHANCE MEETINGS THAT WE ALL EXPERIENCE? THOSE ARE DESTINY POINTS. THEY GUIDE YOU BACK TO YOUR MOST ENERGETIC PATH. YOUR BLUEPRINT. SORTA LIKE A COSMIC GPS DIRECTING US. IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE YOUR DESTINY POINTS. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S PRETTY OUT THERE. SO IS A DOG WHISTLE UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT? THEY'RE CALLED BETWEEN LIFE REGRESSIONS. AND IT GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO GLIMPSE THE SPIRIT WORLD, SEE YOUR DESTINY POINTS, ALSO YOUR PLAN FOR YOUR LIFE. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE READY FOR IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF I SEE IT. WELL, I CAN ONLY ENCOURAGE YOU. I CAN'T OR WON'T FORCE YOU. SO... FUCK IT. WHY NOT? RIGHT? RIGHT. MOVE PAST THIS. NICK, WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT ARE YOU FEELING? AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF LOVE. NICK. NICK, DO I NEED TO GUIDE YOU BACK? OH, HEY. HEY, CAN I GET A VODKA CRANBERRY? SWEET. THANKS. AND, UH, THIS GUY'S HAVING? YEAH, YOU $20 BILL GUY. - WHAT ARE YOU HAVING? - JUST A BEER. AND A BEER FOR...? NICK. NICK DALTON. AND THAT MAKES YOU...? LINDSAY. LINDSAY KLINE. - YOU GRADUATING TOMORROW? - YEAH. - YEAH, HOW ABOUT YOU? - YEAH, ME, TOO. HAVE WE MET? 'CAUSE, UH, YOU KNOW, I KINDA THINK THAT YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE ME. - I SHOULD RECOGNIZE YOU? - YEAH. YEAH. - OH. - I ACTUALLY SAID THAT. - UH... - I... I GOT IT. WELL, I GOT THE NEXT ONE. WE'RE HAVING A NEXT ONE. IT SOUNDS BETTER AS A STATEMENT. OH, DID THAT SOUND LIKE A QUESTION? I LIKE THE PINK STREAK IN YOUR HAIR. - REALLY? - I DO. YEAH. I JUST... I DON'T KNOW, I JUST HAD THE SUDDEN URGE TO JUST... DO SOMETHING OUT OF CHARACTER. - SO IT'S NEW? - YEAH. YEAH, JUST, UH, JUST YESTERDAY. OUT OF CHARACTER IS GOOD SOMETIMES. WELL, CONGRATS. SAME TO YOU. - YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING ME. - I WAS THINKING ABOUT FOLLOWING YOU. YEAH, WELL, LET'S SEE IF YOUR FEET CAN CATCH UP WITH YOUR BRAIN. CHICAGO. I MOVE TOMORROW. YOU HAVE A JOB ALREADY? INVESTMENT BANKING. YOU? AFRICA. JOB? UH, NO, VOLUNTEER FOR THE SUMMER. I'M DOING WORK TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING. VERY NOBLE. I START MY JOB OCTOBER FIRST. WHERE? NEW YORK. - MM. - MARKETING. I HOPE I DIDN'T SCREW UP. BY GETTING TRAPPED IN THIS WHOLE CAREER THING. CAREERS CAN BE REWARDING. I THINK THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF WORK. A JOB, A CAREER, AND A CALLING. OOH. IS THIS GONNA BE A LONG LECTURE? WILL IT BE ON THE FINAL? I AM ABOUT TO INPUT SOME WISDOM. AH! ORACLE FROM FUN SPEAKS. A JOB IS TO EARN MONEY. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE WITH MINIMAL AMOUNT OF EFFORT. YEAH, YEAH, MY SUMMERS. CAREERS ARE THE LONG VIEW. YOU CHASE EXPERIENCE AND CREDENTIALS. THE REWARD... INCOME AND PRESTIGE. YEAH, LIKE ONE OF THOSE, UH, PRESTIGIOUS INVESTMENT BANKER TYPES. A CALLING IS THE ULTIMATE. A CALLING CHASES YOU. SOUNDS DANGEROUS. MAYBE BECAUSE IT COMES TO YOU QUIETLY. IT'S INSPIRATION AND INSPIRATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL, BECAUSE IT INVITES YOU TO TAKE REAL CHANCES. TO LIVE THE LIFE YOU WANT. WITH MEANING AND PURPOSE. IT'S PRETTY GOOD ADVICE. YEAH, AT THE MOMENT THAT'S ALL IT IS. SO LIVE THE LIFE YOU WANT, NICK. NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THAT IS YET. I LIKE YOU, NICK DALTON. I LIKE YOU, TOO, LINDSAY KLINE. I HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT YOU. HI. HEY. - I KNOW! - IT'S OFFICIAL. OH, THE MAN! - ERIC, THIS IS LINDSAY. LINDSAY, ERIC. - HI, NICE TO MEET YOU. - CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE FOR US? - SURE, SURE. - THANKS. - EXCUSE ME. - GREAT. - AWESOME. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - OFF TO FIND THE PARENTS. CALL YA. - NICE TO MEET YOU, LINDSAY. - NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. I, UH... I, UM... SO AS I RECALL, I GOT THE LAST DRINK. YOU KNOW, SO NOW IT'S... NOW IT'S YOUR ROUND. - WELL, I'M GOOD FOR IT. - YEAH? WELL, THEN I'M GOOD FOR THE ONE AFTER THAT. AND THEN WE CAN END UP ON THIS INFINITE LOOP - OF BUYING EACH OTHER DRINKS, RIGHT? - YEAH, THEN IN REHAB. YOU KNOW, WHY DIDN'T OUR PATHS CROSS SOONER? I DON'T KNOW. I WISH I KNEW. MAYBE THEY WILL AGAIN. YEAH, OR, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE... NICK. COME ON. WE'RE WAITING. LET'S GO, NICK. FIVE, FOUR. COMING BACK SLOWLY, BREATHING DEEPLY. ONE. OH, MY GOD. - YOU ALL RIGHT? - I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL NUMB. MY MIND'S GOING A MILLION MILES AN HOUR. TAKE A DEEP BREATH. SLOWLY IN. DOING GREAT. THAT WAS INSANE. GRADUATION WEEKEND WITH LINDSAY, THAT WAS A DESTINY POINT, WASN'T IT? YEAH, I THINK IT WAS. GOD, THIS MAKES NO SENSE. WELL, THINK OF YOU AND LINDSAY AS MAGNETS IN A BOX OF WOODCHIPS. AND YOU'RE SHAKING THE BOX OF WOODCHIPS AND EVENTUALLY OVER TIME, THE MAGNETS ARE DRAWN TOGETHER CONNECTING. SOUL MATES HAVE SIMILAR MAGNETIC FREQUENCIES. LIKE ATTRACTING LIKE. THAT'S WHERE THE IMMEDIATE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY COMES FROM. THE PINK STREAK IN HER HAIR. I DREAMT ABOUT HER MONTHS BEFORE. CAME COMPLETELY OUT OF NOWHERE. I THINK THAT'S A RECOGNITION TRIGGER FOR YOU. I HAVE TO WARN YOU, THOUGH. REUNITING MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT NEITHER ONE OF YOU WANTS TO DO. I HAVE TO. CALL RIDGE. CALLING RIDGE. GRIMES IS READY TO KILL YOU. WHY NOW? HAVE YOU TALKED TO DOUG ROGAN? I CALLED THREE TIMES, HE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK YET. FUCK! ALL RIGHT, YOU CALL GRIMES. I AM NOT GETTING MY ASS KICKED ON YOUR BEHALF AGAIN. AND WHATEVER THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOUR PERSONAL LIFE THAT HAS YOU OUT OF REACH CONSTANTLY, - HAS GOTTA GET SOLVED. - ARE YOU KIDDING ME? DUDE, I CANNOT BE KIDDING YOU ANY LESS. - WE'RE PARTNERS. - EXACTLY. EQUAL FUCKING PARTNERS. NOW DO US A FAVOR AND CALL GRIMES. CALL GRIMES. CALLING GRIMES. WHAT DID ROGAN SAY? HE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK YET. CALL HIM AGAIN. I'VE LEFT THREE MESSAGES IN THE PAST THREE HOURS. WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM IN THE MESSAGE? I TOLD HIM THAT WE NEEDED TO DISCUSS A FEW DISCREPANCIES ON THE PROJECTED DATES. HELLO? WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING? WHAT THE FUCK? I WANTED HIM TO KNOW THAT IT WAS URGENT AND YOU WERE CONCERNED. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM, AND FIND OUT WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? JUST ON MY LAPTOP. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. ALL THE SHIT THAT'S FLYING AROUND HERE AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME COLLEGE CONQUEST. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS. YOU'VE BEEN ON FUCKING SATURN FOR WEEKS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING WILL YOU KEEP IT BETWEEN US? IT'S PART OF MY THERAPY. YOU'RE DEPRESSED? I WAS. I AM. I'M LINKING IT ALL TOGETHER THROUGH THERAPY AND I'M COMING OUT OF IT. I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME. OKAY, UM, I WON'T TELL GRIMES, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET BACK WITH THIS THERMSTER THING LIKE YESTERDAY. GOT IT. I'M ON IT. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ALUMNI OUTREACH. HELLO.

I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHE'S ORIGINALLY FROM. IS THAT LINDSAY WITH AN E OR A? AN A, I BELIEVE. I'M SORRY, I JUST DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE SHE HASN'T REGISTERED YET. HAVE YOU TRIED DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDRAISING? THOSE PEOPLE CAN FIND ANYONE ANYWHERE. ESPECIALLY ALUMNI WITH MONEY. - BANGOR. - EXCUSE ME? BANGOR, MAINE, THAT'S WHERE SHE'S ORIGINALLY FROM.

LINDSAY AND I MET GRADUATION WEEKEND, AND WE ONLY MET FOR TWO DAYS. LINDSAY TOLD ME ABOUT YOU, NICK. SHE DID? REALLY? YES. YOUR NAME CAME UP SEVERAL TIMES THAT WEEKEND AND SOMETIME LATER. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT I JUST REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW SHE'S BEEN ALL THESE YEARS. IF THERE'S ANY WAY POSSIBLE, MAYBE YOU COULD PASS ME ALONG HER NUMBER. I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR YOU, NICK. BUT I CAN'T. LINDSAY'S DEAD. I'M SORRY. I JUST CAN'T HELP YOU. I'M GOOD. I JUST NEED A FEW MINUTES. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, THANKS. SHUT THE DOOR. HI. THIS IS KATRINA. IT'S NICK. - I NEED TO TALK. - HI. UM, OKAY. I HAVE A PATIENT IN FIVE MINUTES, THOUGH. LINDSAY'S DEAD. OH. NICK. I'M SO SORRY. I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TELL HER ANYTHING. TO FIND OUT ANYTHING. THIS IS BULLSHIT! LET'S TAKE THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND SORT THIS OUT. OH, LIKE IT'S A PILE OF LAUNDRY. LISTEN, SOUL MATES COME IN AND OUT OF OUR LIVES FOR A REASON. THE BEST THING I CAN TELL YOU IS FIND OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ABOUT HER LIFE, AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE IN YOUR LIFE. THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FUCK EVERYTHING! IT WAS THIS WHOLE SPIRITUAL CRAP THAT LED ME TO THIS. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GRIEVING RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK THE EVENTS OF THIS ARE VERY SUFFOCATING, BUT LET'S JUST SEE IF THERE'S A LESSON HERE. A LESSON? FUCK THIS! NICK, WE'RE ALL WORRIED. NOW OPEN UP. COME ON, MAN! WE NEED TO TALK! GODDAMN IT. THIS IS SO MUCH SHIT HERE. OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR! HE SENT THOSE ON MY FUCKING DIME? FINDING OUT LINDSAY DIED ALMOST ENDED ME. HOW SO? THOSE SUICIDAL IDEATIONS ALMOST BECAME REALITY. YOU READY TO ORDER? UH, I'LL HAVE ASHALANGA TEA AND HONEY, PLEASE. I'LL HAVE A BLACK COFFEE. WHAT'S HAPPENING? I COULDN'T MOVE. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE I WAS HAVING A CORONARY. I WAS... IT WAS COMPLETELY PARALYZING PAIN. WAS THERE ALSO A SENSE OF BURNING? YEAH. FELT LIKE I HAD A BLOWTORCH GOING UP MY SPINE - AND AROUND MY HEAD. - MM-HMM. AND... AND ANYTHING ELSE? THAT FORK HAS THREE TINES, NOT FOUR, AND THE CLOCK BEHIND THE REGISTER WAS MOUNTED OVER ROTATED. THE ONE IS AT THE TOP AND THE FLOOR IS TAN TRAVERTINE WITH FOUR DIFFERENT SIZED TILES AND OUR WAITRESS IS WEARING A PERFUME WITH A HINT OF LAVENDER. ANYTHING ELSE? I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY I'VE EVER MET IS SURROUNDING ME. AND THERE IS THIS... THIS OVERWHELMING FEELING OF LOVE THAT IS ALL AROUND ME. YOU HAD YOUR FIRST SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE. CONGRATULATIONS. LIKE A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING? THAT'S DIFFERENT. A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE IS... IT'S PROFOUND AND IT HAS A VERY MAGICAL FEELING, BUT IT COMES AND IT GOES. A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING, THAT'S MUCH MORE PERMANENT. THAT'S A SHIFT IN AWARENESS OF THE... OF THE SELF. NICK, HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THE PART OF YOU THAT NOTICES THE NOTICING? YOU LOST ME. WHEN A TODDLER LOOKS IN THE MIRROR HE SEES HIMSELF AND THERE BEGINS THE EGO. A BEGINNING OF PROTECTING THAT ME, ME, ME. THAT FEELING I KNOW. EXPERIENCES LIKE YOU HAD TODAY, THAT... THAT'S A BREAK IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ME MIND BODY. UM, IT CAN TRIGGER AN AWAKENING. AN AWAKENING THAT THERE'S MORE THAN JUST THIS BODY. I MEAN, UM, THINK OF US LIKE A... A WAVE, AND HOW YOU CAN VIEWED AS AN INDIVIDUAL, BUT YOU'RE STILL PART OF ONE OCEAN. AND A WAVE WASHES ASHORE AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO SEA TO REFORM A NEW WAVE. SO EVERY LIFE IS A NEW WAVE? YEAH. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GO FROM HERE. I WOULD SAY THAT LINDSAY CAME INTO YOUR AWARENESS FOR A REASON. I WOULD EXPLORE THAT. NICK? NICK, IT'S RIDGE. YOU IN THERE? COME ON, MAN. WE ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU. COMING. COME ON, NICK. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT, REALLY, REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. OKAY, SO WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM SIMPLY HERE TO TELL YOU YOU'VE GOT 48 HOURS TO GET YOURSELF BACK TOGETHER AND GET BACK TO WORK. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM? I... I TOLD HIM THAT YOU HAVE ANXIETY, THAT YOU NEED A BREAK. OH, FUCK. - WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY? - OH, I... I COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND. UH, NICK, ASSHOLE, JOB ABANDONMENT, FIRED, BUNCH OF FUCKS. A STAPLER FLEW PAST. I WAS ONLY GONE A DAY. YEAH, BUT YOU MISSED THE CALL WITH ROGAN. WE'RE FUCKED. YOU KNOW, HE HALF ADMITTED THAT THEY LIED TO US. SCRAP THE DEAL. FUCK IT. NO, GRIMES WANTS US TO PUSH THIS IPO THROUGH, PUT LIPSTICK ON THIS PIG. WITHOUT THE TECHNOLOGY, IT'S GONNA DESTROY OUR REPUTATION. HE DIDN'T CARE. HE JUST WANTS TO COLLECT HIS MASSIVE FEE. ALL RIGHT, TELL HIM I GOT THE MESSAGE. - THAT'S IT? - THAT'S IT. HELLO? HELLO, UH, MRS. KLINE? THIS IS NICK DALTON. I'M SORRY IF I'M BOTHERING YOU. I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE AND EXTEND MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES. THANK YOU, NICK. BUT YOU DO HAVE ME QUITE CURIOUS. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. HOW ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING? DURING THERAPY, THERE'S BEEN QUITE A FEW REVELATIONS. NICK? - MRS. KLINE. - COME IN. MEMORIES ARE ALL I HAVE LEFT OF MY BABY GIRL. MM, SHE NEVER FUSSED. SHE SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT HER FIRST WEEK. SHE WAS A BIT OF A TOMBOY. DEFINITELY AS GOOD AS ANY OF THOSE BOYS. SHE MADE IT TO THE OLYMPIC TRIALS. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE SKATED. SHE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH. I THINK IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER. I DON'T KNOW HOW I MISSED... DENIED THOSE FEELINGS THAT WEEKEND. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST I HAD SEEN LINDSAY IN YEARS. OH, SHE WAS FULL OF LIGHT, AND YOU ALMOST CAUSED HER TO MISS THAT AFRICAN TRIP. WHY? I THOUGHT SHE WAS TOTALLY SET ON IT. SHE HOPED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU. YOU KNOW, SHE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY YOU DIDN'T RESPOND TO HER MESSAGE. WHAT MESSAGE? WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM AFRICA, SHE LEFT YOU A MESSAGE AT YOUR WORK. SHE ASSUMED YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED. AFTER THAT, SHE RESCINDED HER JOB OFFER AND STARTED HER NON-PROFIT. SHE CHOSE TO LIVE HER CALLING. HER CALLING. WE MEET PEOPLE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, NICK. MAYBE THAT WAS YOUR GIFT TO HER. SHE LIVED A FULL LIFE. NOT QUITE. THAT DAY, THE CAR. SHE DROVE TO ATLANTA FOR A CONFERENCE. A SEMI CUT HER OFF AND THE CAR JUST... HIT THE WALL AND FLIPPED. YES. I SAW THE CAR. I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT IN ATLANTA. THE TRAFFIC... IT WAS SO BACKED UP. I MISSED MY FLIGHT. AND THE FLIGHT THAT I MISSED CRASHED ON ITS TAKEOFF. EVERYBODY DIED. MAYBE THAT WAS HER GIFT TO YOU. YOU'RE KIDDING. DRIVES A PORSCHE? IT'S A PERK. REMEMBER? CLASSIC. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. NOT KIDDING. YOU'LL BE BACK. ASSHOLE. THE REAL REASON FOR A SOULFUL RELATIONSHIP SOMETIMES DOESN'T, UM, SHOW ITSELF UNTIL IT'S OVER. IT'S LIKE A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT TRANSFORMS BOTH LIVES. SHE DEFINITELY HELPED TRANSFORM MINE. YEAH. YOU GONNA BE OKAY? IT FEELS STRANGE. AND AT THE SAME TIME I AM SO GRATEFUL I GOT TO EXPERIENCE ALL OF THIS. YEAH. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING. I JUST POINTED YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. YOU BELIEVED. THAT'S THE HARD PART. I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
