[bright music playing] [light whimsical music playing] [light whimsical music rising] [dreamy music playing] [light whimsical music playing] [light whimsical music rising] [whimsical music fading] [cheery music playing] [Ivy] Bean! [dog barking in distance] Where are you? You have to see this! I'm in the tree house, Ivy! Ghosts and swords, Bean! And an evil duke! [mischievous music playing] Hmm? [chuckles] [anticipatory music playing] [Ivy] Giselle falls in love with a duke, who likes her, but really, he's gonna marry a princess. So Giselle dies of a broken heart. Ow, my heart. I'm dead now. Her ghost goes into the forest and meets these other ghosts with broken hearts called the Wilis. [all] You're mean, evil duke. And they all surround the duke and dance him... to death. - Taste my arabesque! - [Duke groans] [both] I wanna be Giselle! Oh. Okay. You be Giselle first. Uh... You can be one of the Wilis. With extremely long fingernails. No, we need an evil duke, so you can kick his head off. But watch out, I... [exhales] ...have a sword. [grandiose orchestral music playing] - [both grunting] - [Ivy screaming] [Bean] Get away from me, Giselle ghost! - [Ivy screams] - [Bean grunts] What that girl comes up with. [laughs] Typical Saturday Bean. [both grunting] What is she supposed to be? - A superhero or something? - I... - [Ivy] A-ha, evil duke! - [Bean grunts] [Ivy] My Wilis will get you! More like a super-zero. [Bean screams] Your dancing is too strong for me. [David] Nancy... [screams] Get him, Wilis. Dance him to death. [Bean screaming] - [thrilling music plays] - [Wilis snarl] [ghostly whispers] Keep back, or I'll sword you. I'll chop off your spinning little legs! [Wilis] Dance you to death! Dance you to death! Dance you to death! - [Bean grunting] - Dance you to death! Dance you to death! - Dance you to death! Dance you to death! - [Bean groaning] [Bean whimpers] [ghostly whispers] - [Bean grunting] - [Wilis snarling] [thrilling music rising] Now comes the part where I kick off your head! - [grunts] - [ghostly whispers] Hey. Are you guys playing Wiffle ball? Can I be pitcher? Leo! Great. You can be the duke, and Ivy and I can both be Giselles. Giselles? What's that? It's a ballet. Is there a uniform? There are tights. [gasps] - See ya. - Don't be silly, Leo. It's jumping and kicking as high as your head! [sighs] Poor Leo. He doesn't know that ballet is about dancing your enemies to death. - Yeah! - [Bean] Yah! Bean, what if we learned how to actually do ballet? [gasps] For real. [anticipatory music playing] [curious music playing] Grandma sent you this? Aw, she was always trying to get me to dance. - You didn't want to? - I have two left feet and zero rhythm. But this is a great time for you to explore things that catch your interest, so ballet lessons it is. - Yes! - [gasps] That was so easy. You just have to ask your mom. And now that your mom has said yes, my mom has to, too. Absolutely not. But ballet's my destiny. [laughs] Enough, Nancy. Pick up the bread, please. Since when is ballet your destiny? Since today. The best part is kicking off heads. Watch this. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful, twinkle toes. - [Nancy] Ugh! Bean, we're not spending money on something you'll quit in two weeks. [sighs] But I have to take lessons, Mom. This is a great time to explore things that catch my interest. [both laugh] Didn't you tell me you had to take gymnastics? [grunting] And had to learn trumpet? [trumpet blaring] And had to play softball. [David and Charlotte] Catch it, Bean! [crowd groaning] You quit them all. I won't quit ballet. I love ballet. Of course, you'll quit. I bet you $5 you'll quit. Deal. Double deal. Ten dollars. I won't quit, ever. Yes, you will. You won't even last learning all five positions. I barely did. [uneasy music playing] Hang on. You let Nancy take ballet. That's not fair. - That means you love her more than me. - Yeah. - Love has nothing to do with it. - Please... [continues pleading] Let her do it. I need the money. [continues pleading] - Okay, Bean, you can take ballet. - [pleading stops] - Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay! - Wait! On one condition. Anything. You name it, Mom. You may not quit. You have to stick it out for the full term. All the lessons. No quitting and no complaining. I promise, Mom, on an oath of spit. [spits] Your promise is good enough. Go wash your hands. - Uh... Twice. - [Bean chuckles] [Bean] Yes! - [Charlotte] Really? - [Bean chuckles] Ballet? Well, it's better than tap. Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour, bonjour, bonjour! Bienvenue. Welcome to The Joyful School of Ballet. Seeing all your shining faces makes me smile. I am not only your instructor, but I am also a fellow dancer myself. [bones cracking] [teacher groaning] [bones cracking] And why, you might ask, do I dance? - When I dance, my body and soul soars! - [mouthing] [tinkling piano music plays] I am your teacher, your maître de ballet, Mr. Joy. But here, you will call me Monsieur Joie. That is how my name is pronounced in la belle française. The birthplace of ballet. So here, I am Monsieur Joie, c'est moi. - Monsieur Ju-ah? - Joy. Joy means "Joie." - Joie? - Joie. Just watch my mouth. Ju-Ju-Ju-Joie. - Joie. - Ja? - Joie! - Like "wah-wah." - Jo... - Ju-wah? Joie. Joie. - [thumps] - [kids gasp] Just do your best. [kids] Yes, Monsieur Joie! Now, when I call your name, please raise your hand. [in heavy French accent] Eric? [in heavy French accent] Eric? [kid whispers] What? Eric? [Eric gasps] Emma? - Hmm. - Mmm-hmm. Zuzu? Je m'appelle Zuzu, Monsieur Joie. Je suis très impressed. [chuckles softly] [Monsieur Joie] Bonne. - [Emma chuckles] - [door opens] [grandiose orchestral music playing] [music rising] [music fades] - Who are you? - We're in your class. Ivy and Bean. Wha-wha-wha-wha... What are... What are you wearing? It's an evil duke costume. - For Giselle. - [kids laugh] It hurts my eyeballs. Uh, please change now, mademoiselles. This is a ballet class, not a circus camp. [kids chuckling] [playing circus music] Maman, please. [continues playing circus music] - [music stops] - [sighs] - [in heavy French accent] Melanie. - [bright piano music playing] Excellent, Monsieur Eric. You are almost like a young me. Hmm. [Bean sighs] Almost. [whispers] How are you so good? - [Ivy] You're so clumsy. - I don't know. [bright music continues] - [Monsieur Joie] Grand battement, plié. - [groans] [Ivy grunting] [Monsieur Joie] Good. Beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup. Wonderful. Monsieur Joie, can I ask you a question? - Yes. - When do we start kicking heads off? When do we do the fun ballet? What is the... "fun ballet"? Like in Giselle. Sword fights, broken-hearted killer ghosts. Oh, that fun ballet. Hmm. Peut-être after you learn the basics. - I'd say four or five minute... - [gasps] Years! [exhales deeply] - [Monsieur Joie laughs] - [whispers] Years? [upbeat piano music playing] [Monsieur Joie] All together now. Tendu, grand battement, grand battement, plié. Again! Tendu, grand battement, grand battement, plié... Ah! Ah! Oh, wow. What... What is this? My mom says that I should dance like no one's watching. Yes, well, I can understand why she'd tell you that. On... the... beat, mademoiselle! On the beat! - [sweet piano music plays] - [Ivy grunts] Here, I'll show her, Monsieur Joie. Like this, Ivy. [sweet piano music continues] [Ivy] Uh... [grunting] [grunting continues] [in French accent] No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! - Without the music. - [piano stops] Okay, imagine... you are a gazelle. Giselle? With the duke and ghostly Wilis? No! No! Gazelle, the animal. Racing across the African plains, gracefully extending your limbs. - Whoa! - [disgusted groan] - [Ivy grunts] - Okay. - [kids laughing] - [Monsieur Joie] Okay! All right, all right! We're gonna forget the gazelle, and we're going to march. - [rhythmic music plays] - March. Knees up and march. [in rhythmic tone] Not you. You are ballet students. Just Ivy's marching, and apparently Bean. - [rhythmic music continues] - [stomping] [exasperated sigh] I was the worst. Everyone laughed. I never want to go back. Me neither. Ballet is not our destiny, Ivy. It is our despair. [both sigh] [Nancy] Mom, 13 is so far away. [Charlotte] It's not that far away. Nancy, could you just slow down a little bit? I'm in seventh grade. Seventh, Mom. We're converting fractions to decimals. We're studying puberty. Sixth graders aren't doing that. Fourth graders aren't, but there are plenty of them who have earrings. [Charlotte] Nancy, please. Hi, girls. How was ballet? You gonna quit? It was great. - Yes, so much fun. - [sighs] - [nervous chuckle] - [car honks] - [kid's mom] Hi, Charlotte! - Impossible. No way. You hated it. I bet Monsieur Joie ate you alive. Nope. We loved it. He loved us. The word "gazelle" was used. We are the stars of the class. Let's change the bet. Double or nothing. Twenty dollars that says no way are you two dorks ever gonna be the stars. - Girls! - Prepare to be totally broke. Actually, I'm preparing to be rich. Twenty dollars is mine. - Nancy, please. This car is not a casino. - [sighs] - [pensive music playing] - [kids shouting] What are you boys up to? We just ran a marathon. Our third this year. - [postwoman laughs] - [dog barks] [whimsical music playing] [Ivy] This is our only hope. A spell won't help. I had to promise I wouldn't quit. Listen to this. Forgetfulness spell. - [Bean groans] - Turn back time and erase the past. If we do this right, they won't even remember we talked about ballet or that they paid for it. Bean, do you want to take capoeira lessons? It's been so long since you've taken any kind of lessons, anywhere. [Bean] Perfect! Mom will forget my promise, and Nancy will forget the bet. What do we need? First up... ten dead flies. [gasps] [Katrine] Thank you so much. My pleasure. My pleasure. You know, I remember... [mischievous music playing] [Charlotte]...raisins and sweet potato pie. That's like a family tradition... Ready? [Katrine] Oh, no! I'm like, "How you gonna make it fluffy?" How is it even gonna be thick? If you're gonna put almond... Ow! I think ballet broke my knee bone, Mom. - [Charlotte] Oh. - [Bean] It's all purple. - Did you paint your knee? - [clicks tongue] No. [giggles, chokes] Rose and nettle, flies and leaf, erase the past, relieve our grief! - [gasps] - [Charlotte] Ooh! [gasps] [Katrine] Ivy! Are you throwing flies at me? Do you remember what day it is? Yes. It is the day that you threw dead insects and leaf bits into our dinner. Can you tell me the name of your favorite anthropologist? Can you tell me the name of what we're gonna eat now? - [uneasy music playing] - Um... Do you remember a promise I made a long time ago? Last week? When you agreed to stick with ballet? [sighs] Dang. Some spell. Shh. Did you put a spell on us? Uh... Why? Hmm... Because we want to quit ballet. It was awful. Mmm-hmm. I was awful. I thought it'd be fun, but everyone laughed. Honey. You don't have to take ballet. [Bean gasps] If it's not for you, just... just stop. You're not mad? No, of course not. I want you to explore things, so you can find out what you are and aren't passionate about. Hmm. You did discover something. You discovered that ballet wasn't for you. [giggles] Come here. [exhales] Hmm? Don't even think about it. Mom, you're so unfair. Ivy's mom let her quit. Well, I'm not Ivy's mom. Moms are different just the way kids are different. But I'm not different from Ivy. I also discovered ballet isn't for me, so how come I can't quit? [Charlotte] Aside from the fact that you made a promise? Because I want you to learn how to stick with something, Bean. Ballet is hard. But if you work at it and persevere, you might discover you're good at it. Or die of boredom. It happens, you know. Or learn to like it. Either way, I think you'll survive. - [groans] - [Charlotte] You may even thank me. Come on. Now, go take a bath. No, you made me take a bath yesterday. [crickets chirping] [ticking] [David] Bean, straight to bed. Lights out in ten minutes. [Bean groans] [mischievous music playing] [creaking] [clattering] [toy squeaks, clatters] - [sighs] - [clatters] [angry grunt] - [radio static] - [Ivy] Wanda Rich reporting for duty. What's your 20, Grizzly Girl? - [Bean sighs] - [Ivy] Grizzly Girl? Are you there? Bean! - Bean? - [Bean] I'm here. In a not good mood. My life is ruined. She really won't let you quit? [sighs] Nope. I even tried to cry. She just told me to stop drooling. This is bad. [exhales] If you have to do ballet, I think I have to do it too. No, you don't. I was the one who got you into this. It was all my idea. Are you sure? What if you fall, like, a hundred times? I won't quit. What if you twirl so much your toes bleed in your ballet shoes and get scabs that fall off and bleed even more? I still won't quit. [sighs] What if kids laugh at you? [pensive music playing] I'll have to endure. [radio static] I guess we're doomed, Ivy. You and me. Doomed to dance. [pensive music continues] [sighs] [Monsieur Joie] Group un. [soft piano music playing] Very good. Group deux. Ah, bonne. Group trois. [Ivy and Bean sigh] Group Ivy and Bean. - [ominous music playing] - Ah! - [grunts] - [Monsieur Joie] Oh, no. No, no, no. - Oh. - [Ivy grunts] [groaning] - [grunting] - [Monsieur Joie] Oh, mademoiselles. [unsettling music playing] [both grunting] Oh. - [Ivy] Ah! - [Bean grunting] [Monsieur Joie] Lovely, Zuzu. - Remember, we are what? - [Bean grunting] Gazelles! [Ivy and Bean grunting] - [Bean] Yeah! - [Ivy grunts] - Oh. - [Ivy thuds] - Whoa! - [Ivy and Bean scream] - [screaming] - [Monsieur Joie groans] [Ivy groans] [unsettling music fading] [Ivy, Bean, and Monsieur Joie groaning] [calm music playing] [Monsieur Joie] All right, mes enfants. Settle down. Settle down. - [banging] - Marvelous news. This year, for the first time, we are not doing a little recital here in the studio. Instead, we are taking part in A Festival of Movement. A Dance Delirium in 26 Acts. Which is why I have chosen something très unique for this performance. Something with magic and suspense. For this is a story of two magical creatures who fall in love. A mermaid... - Zuzu. - [gasps] Yes! - Yes! - And a seahorse, Eric. [gasps] It is called Wedding Beneath the Sea. - Eric? - There's not any kissy stuff, is there? [in French accent] No. No, no, no, no. Well, oui, oui. No. No, no, no, no. Your... Your... Your emotions are expressed through the artistry of dance. - Say it with me. When I dance... - My body and soul soars? My body and soul soars. Yes, Zuzu. Merci. Emma, you are a tropical fish who marries them. - Oh, yes. - Oh my! The rest of you are wedding guests. You bring presents. You dance. - You tra-la-la. - [kids giggle] Monsieur Joie? What do Bean and I do? [groans] Yes, you two. You'll be delighted to know I have taken on the choreographic challenge. I have taken your erratic... What would you even call... Movements. And transmuted them into art. - You will be friendly squid. - [kids giggling] Standing guard at the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very edge of the stage. Like so, your tentacles waving on the passing tide, ensuring the success of the wedding. - Friendly squid? - They're just happy to be there. The invitation strictly said no babies and no squid. Oh! Best of all, this year's performance takes place at... [grandiose music playing] - The Burroughs Theater. - [kids gasp] Which seats 300 people. [excited chatter, cheering] [dramatic orchestral music playing] It's not that I want to be like everyone else. It's just... Earrings are fun, Mom. - They feel like me. - [chuckles] I said the same thing to your grandma when I was your age. I wanted to dye my hair green. Green? [softly] Yeah. [mischievous music plays] Did she let you? No. No, she did not. [sighs] - [Bean sighs] - [Charlotte] Ivy? Bean? What's the matter? [sighs] Nothing. Oh, honey. You sure? You look like you actually hurt your knee bone this time. - [Monsieur Joie] Bonjour, Madame. - [gasps] - Can we just go, please? - Bonjour, Madame. Nancy. [chuckles] Hi, Harold. It's "Monsieur Joie." - Monsieur Joie. - Ah. - How are these two doing? - We... Oh, yes... They're... They're, um... I've never had budding little dancers who are... who are quite so... Uh, um... You know, I don't think that there's a word for it in French. - [chuckles] - And they forgot their announcements. - The big recital. - [Ivy sighs] - Au revoir! - [chuckles] [grandiose orchestral music playing] Bye, Harold. A recital will be great. I bet you have fun parts. Yeah. Fun parts as the stars of the show, right? That's right, Nancy. - We're in every scene. - Really? [Charlotte] You got some new dancers this year. [light thrilling music plays] You're the two friendly squid? That is so embarrassing. Nancy, could you be nice to your sister, just once? I am nice. I cannot wait to see Bean as the friendly squid. [sighs] No one's gonna laugh, Bean. Everybody is going to be very proud. - [soft chuckle] - Buckle up. [sighs] [quirky music playing] [both laughing, giggling] [school bell ringing] [quirky music playing] Eric, honey, you were supposed to paint the fish, not yourself. [Eric] Sorry. Okay. Ten more minutes, class, then we'll hang your fish prints on the wall. Please get these permission slips signed by your parents as soon as possible, otherwise you won't be able to go on the field trip. - [giggling] - What's so funny? Nothing, just your fish printing. [chuckles] Zuzu said you guys are gonna be like this fish at your recital. A flop. [kids laughing] Why do you care? You're not even coming. I'm coming with my sister. We both love ballet. Who else is going to the dance festival? I am, Paisley. [Ms. Aruba-Tate] Dance festival? [kid 1] I didn't know you can dance, Ivy. No way. Don't worry. They're coming to watch dancing. Not wiggling. And definitely not wiggling, friendly squid. [chuckles] I might be there for the wiggling, friendly squid. What exactly is a squid? It has ink, right? - And weird tentacle arms. - [kids laugh] [kid 2] Leo. Okay, class, who wants the horseshoe crab? - [kid 3] I do! I do! It's an arthropod, a living fossil. - Yeah? - [Emma] Thanks, Ms. Aruba-Tate. And then there's this little invertebrate. A squid! [Ms. Aruba-Tate] All yours, Dusit. [in silly voice] I'm doing ballet. I'm so silly. I'm Ivy and Bean. - [kids giggling] - [Bean grumbles] [birds chirping] [Ivy sighs] That was just the beginning, Bean. The whole school will be laughing at us. Nancy, too. She'll see we're not the stars of the show, and she'll get $20. I'll have to do chores forever to pay that. There has to be some way out of this. Nothing's impossible. Being good at ballet is impossible. Yeah. [inhales deeply] [gasps] But it wouldn't be impossible to break our legs. Huh? [anticipatory music playing] [Bean] Ivy, we shouldn't do this. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. [sighs] You know, when Eric broke his arm, the first time, you could almost see his bone sticking out. - Maybe breaking is a very bad idea. - Mmm-hmm. How about spraining? [inhales sharply] - [mischievous music playing] - [both exhaling] Au revoir, recital! Toodle-oo tentacles! - [both grunting] - Whoa! [foreboding music playing] [both screaming] [both] This is a bad idea! Probably just a bruise would work. [Bean sighs] Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. - Huh? - We look like idiots. Squidiots. - Oh. - There's not enough tentacles. There's supposed to be ten. - Are you sure it's not eight? - Ten. They're ten-tacles. Oh. No complaining. Because you girls... look great. [chuckles] - [indistinct chatter] - [struggling grunts] - [Charlotte] Right, but did you... - Huh? [dramatic music playing] [David laughs] [both laugh] Huh? [Katrine] It's, um... - [David] What do you think? - Very squid-like. - Mmm-hmm. - [David] Right? - Uh-huh. - So cute. Don't lie, Mom. You're laughing. - No. [laughs] - No. - I choked on a cracker. - Mmm-hmm. [Katrine] You know what would make this? If we did something around the neck with like a scarf? - Or, um, what about a bow tie? - Bow tie, yes. - Oh! - [giggling] The problem is there's not enough tentacles. - And more tentacles, definitely. - [Katrine] Mmm-hmm. - [Charlotte] And some suction cups. - [Katrine] Yes. [laughter] You can't be serious. There's not enough tentacles. The number of tentacles is definitely the problem. Nancy. [laughs] [Nancy] I can't wait to see this. Stars of the show. [David] She's just jealous. - You girls are gonna be great. - [Bean] Hmm. There's got to be some way not to do this besides breaking bones. Are you sure you haven't figured out that invisibility spell? I don't think any spell can help us now. Maybe we can just hide ourselves up in the tree house with ten years of supplies? They'd probably just cut it down and make us go. [dog barks in distance] Mmm, maybe we should just run away? I love running away. Where should we go? What about the park? - There's a policeman with a dog. - [door opens] - He smells you. - [David] Bye, Katrine. - [Katrine] Thanks for the costumes. - [David] You're welcome. - [Charlotte] See you tomorrow. - [Katrine] Dinner in a half-hour, Ivy. I signed your permission slip for the aquarium. Don't forget to put it in your bag. [gasps] I can't believe we didn't see this. Read! ["Jump in the Line" playing] "Permission to go to the aquarium." It's the same day as the recital. We can run away and hide at the aquarium. By the time they find us, the dance festival will be over. [both] Yes! ♪ Shake, shake, Senora ♪ [laughing, whooping] ♪ Shake, shake, shake... ♪ Come on, Ivy! [whooping] [squeaks] ["Jump in the Line" continues] Watch for cars. - [Leo exhales] - [kids laughing] Be careful. Cross the street. Come on. [Vanessa] I'm gonna catch you, Leo! Whoa. [epic music playing] Our new home. The minute no one's watching, we'll find a place to hide. Ivy, Bean, come on, keep up. [Ivy and Bean] Coming! I don't want to lose you. [mysterious music playing] [announcer] Welcome to the aquarium. Today, the Marine Mammal Rescue Team will be feeding the dolphins at 2 p.m... What's in your backpacks? None of your beeswax. I brought fish chum for the sharks. I wanna see a feeding frenzy. - [Emma gasps] - [Dusit] It's gonna be carnage. Could I throw some? - I'd love to see a feeding frenzy. - Ugh! - [Emma] And I love sharks. - [Bean] How about down there? Okay, listen up everyone. Come here, please. Come on. - Come here. - [Eric] Whoa! This place is great. Ivy, Bean, come up with the rest of us, please. We're gonna stay on the first floor today, all right? Find your field trip buddy. Eric, Paisley couldn't make it. So, you and Vanessa should buddy up today. - [Eric] Yes, miss. - Let's go! [kids] Yes, Ms. Aruba-Tate! [quirky music playing] [kid 1] Wow! Whoa! [wondrous music playing] [kids exclaiming] Are there any sharks here? Even just one great white? Or any other color will do. Dusit, we're gonna hand this over to our expert guide. - And we'll get questions after, okay? - [class] Whoa! The sea lions, who call this tank home, are faster than any other type of seal. - [kid 2] Wow, look at that! - [kid 3] Whoa! They can move at 25 miles per hour, which helps them feed on sardines. - [kid 4] Oh, they're beautiful! - But they also love to play not with... sharks so much, but they are very good surfers. [both laugh] [Ms. Aruba-Tate clears throat] [kid 5] Whoa. [Ms. Aruba-Tate] Eric, don't touch the glass, please. - We don't want any accidents. - Bean. We gotta go. - [kid 6] Dusit... - Whoa! [Ms. Aruba-Tate] Dusit, put away the fish chum, please. [adventurous music playing] [both panting] [running footsteps] [music rising] Whoa. That could be where we hide out. [exhales] [breathes deeply] [foreboding music playing] [eerie music playing] Whoa! This is perfect. [Bean] It's so private. I call this one! [Ivy] This one's mine. [Bean clears throat] [inhales deeply] - [mysterious music sting] - [sighs] What just happened? I don't know. Try and find a light. Okay. There's gotta be one somewhere. Hmm. Nothing. [gasps] I found something! [beeping] [mysterious music playing] [Bean] Whoa, Nelly! [aquarium narrator] The ocean is full of many mysteries... - Whoa. - ...but none quite as mysterious as the creatures of the deep. [Bean] Ivy? I get it. This shows what life is like at the bottom of the sea. Oh, look. [aquarium narrator] Prepare to be amazed. What the heck is that? [aquarium narrator] The extraordinary anglerfish has a luminous spine that lures victims into its sharp teeth. [both shuddering] I think I'd rather do the recital. - Me too! - [both whimper] [both grunting] [aquarium narrator] In these black waters lurks the dragon of the deep, the giant squid. - [Bean gasps] - [aquarium narrator] It watches and waits... ready to strike. Are you brave enough to face its tentacles? [both screaming] [screaming continues] [mischievous music playing] [screaming continues] [screaming continues] There they are. Thank you. [screaming stops] Ivy, Bean, where were you? I was so worried. - We got scared. - We got really scared. Oh, no. Because you were lost? Ye-yes. Lo-lost. You poor things. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. You're safe now. - Hmm. I told you they weren't dead. I didn't say dead. I said, "Probably eaten by a sea lion." [Ms. Aruba-Tate] It's okay. You're here and safe. - [Ivy and Bean] Thanks, Ms. Aruba-Tate. - [sighs] We got to see the eels, and you didn't. They're freaky scary. Not as intimidating as a giant squid. It had this freaky big eye that hypnotized us. Bean, a squid can't hypnotize people. [Leo] There is not a giant squid in here. Nobody has a giant squid. Giant squid? How did you guys get to the Creatures of the Deep room? That's on a totally different floor. - Ivy? - Uh... Did you get lost on purpose? Um... Well... So, I thought... It was kind of my fault, Ms. Aruba-Tate. Don't blame Ivy. We started off a little lost, and then I said, "Let's go this way." But it was the wrong way. So, I said, "Here are some stairs that we can go down together." [Bean groans] Thank you again for everything. You're welcome. Bye. [Ms. Aruba-Tate] We're gonna be leaving in a minute. Yes! Ivy, Bean, if I can't trust you two to behave safely and responsibly, you realize I won't be able to take you on any future field trips. I'm sorry, Ms. Aruba-Tate. I am too. Really sorry. Really. I know you can help each other do better when it comes to things like this. I also know you can help each other do great things. Eric told me that you're all performing in a dance recital tonight. I'm really looking forward to it. [driver] All right, kids. Please take your seats. [whimsical music playing] [announcer] Welcome, one and all, to tonight's Dance Delirium. - A Festival of Movement in 26 Acts. - [laughing] - You will be delighted, amazed, and... - Twenty-six acts? I hate how they design these recitals to go on forever. Oh, I... I mean, not yours, honey. You were great. No, no, it's fine. This is gonna be great. Great for me. Twenty dollars is mine. There's no way these squidiots are gonna be stars of the show. - [cheering] - [stomping] [jazz music playing] Oh. [audience cheering] [jazz music continues] [gasps] [audience cheering] [claps] [shoes tap] [audience cheering] [jazz music rising] [music stops] [audience applauding] Huh? [festival announcer] Please take your seats. Act 14 will start in one minute. - [quirky music playing] - [sighs] [whispering] Five. Ten. Fifteen. Twenty. [Monsieur Joie] Securing rope. Almost ready. Standing by. Standing by. Raise. Put some muscle into it, Maman. We don't have all day. Whale ascending! Whale ascending. [pulley squeaking] You guys like my fins? Like a real fish. [Monsieur Joie] Put your back into it, Maman. - [creaks, loud clatter] - Oh! Maman! - [creaking] - [chuckles] You guys do look, uh, friendly, which is good because in the program it does say that you are friendly squids. I don't think Monsieur Joie has seen a real squid. A real giant squid is not friendly at all. [Monsieur Joie] Who has the glitter? The glitter is très important! Mm-mm. Where are my stars? Where are my stars? Where are you? - Je suis ici, monsieur. - Oh! - [Monsieur Joie] Then, now I can focus. - Oh, no. You really can't dance with those tentacles. Which, when you think about it is, well, probably a good thing. - [Monsieur Joie] You are the fish. - Hmm. [Monsieur Joie] Feel the water. See the coral. Oh. Mademoiselles Bean and Ivy. Well, you certainly are, um... well-tentacled. Uh, just please don't knock down the set. [shrieks] Mon Dieu! Places! Places! 14th act! That's us! - Tout de suite! That means get on stage! - [kid] Go, go. [Monsieur Joie] Get on stage! [announcer] Please take your seats. Act 14 is about to commence. Amanda, look! [chuckles] [whimsical music playing] So talented. Wow! [exclaims] [dreamy music playing] - Oh. - Oh. [chuckles] Uh... uh... [chuckles] - Is that really Bean and Ivy? - So goofy. [Bean] What do I do? [Ivy] Put your arms up. [chuckles] [dreamy music continues] [groaning] - [Bean] Look, Ivy, over here! Quickly! - [Ivy] Ah! [Bean] Spin, spin, spin! [dreamy music rising] - [Ivy] Watch out, Bean. - [Bean] Sorry, Ivy. [laughs] Twenty dollars. [Ivy] Whoa, whoa. [all laughing] - Wait. Are we supposed to be in the back? - Oh. [both giggling] [whimsical music playing] You're right, Ivy. A real squid is the opposite of friendly. A real squid would never just stand around wiggling. A real squid just lurks in the shadows until it's time to attack, like the Wilis in Giselle. A real squid doesn't care about a stupid bet with a stupid big sister. A real squid doesn't care if people laugh at them. A real squid doesn't care about anything. It rules the seas. [thrilling music playing] - We're standing by with the glitter. - Mmm-hmm. - And go. - [breathes deeply] Go. Go, go, go. Faster. Come on, faster. [creaking] [screams] [audience gasping] - [screams] - [gasps] [woman shrieks] [snaps] - [kids screaming] - [Ivy] Zuzu! - [gasps] - Huh? Come on, friendly squid. Help a whale out! [Ivy and Bean grunt] [exclaiming, laughing] [audience cheering] [in French accent] No, no, no, no, no. - [audience applauding] - [Bean] Squids coming through. Oh, oh! [screams] Ah! Whoa! - [laughter, giggles] - [Monsieur Joie] Oh! - [giggling] - [screams] When I dance, my body and soul soars! [chuckles] - [Monsieur Joie screaming] - [audience applauding] [victorious music playing] [man] Good job! [audience cheering] [victorious music rising] [screaming] [Monsieur Joie] The show must go on. [victorious music stops] [audience cheering] [Ivy] We're out! We're done! And we never have to go back on stage! Or stand around in first position. We can do what squid do. [both grunt] [mischievous music playing] Giant squid versus whale! [squeals, giggles] - [air hissing] - [both grunting] [grunting, squealing] [audience chanting] Squid! Squid! Squid! - Huh? - [audience] Squid! Squid! [clapping rhythmically] Squid! Squid! Do they mean us? [audience chanting] Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! [audience cheering, chanting] - Squid! Squid! Squid! - Go, Squid! [audience] Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! [cheering and whistling] [all] Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! [all chanting] Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid! - [chuckles] - Squid! Squid! Squid! - [chuckling] - Squid forever! [audience whooping] - Brava! - Brava! - Yes! - [all cheering] Encore! Encore! You were right not to let them quit. Yes, but let's agree that they're quitting after this. Oh, thank God. [cheering] [laughter] [guffawing] [pops] [triumphant music playing] [cheering, whooping] [chuckling] - [Bean] Yeah. - Three hundred people cheering for us? I still can't believe it. We were the stars, Ivy. [Nancy] Bean, all I can say to you two is... [gasps] You earned this. [gasps, chuckles] [squeals, chuckles] And you earned this. - [gasps] - [Charlotte chuckles] - Mom, I can get my ears pierced? - Mmm-hmm. Why'd you change your mind? You convinced me a while ago, honey. I was just waiting for the perfect moment. - [giggles] - [David laughing] Twenty dollars, Ivy. Twenty! We're rich! It's your money, Bean. It's our money. You heard my sister, we earned it. So, what should we spend it on? There's so many things we can do together. I've got some pretty good ideas. Don't you? Mmm-hmm. Ivy, Bean, come. - You saved the day. Come on! - [kids chuckle] - [ballet student] Squid versus squid! - [ballet students] Go squid! [Zuzu] Squids are the best! [calm music playing] [quirky music playing] [Travis] What are you doing, Bean? I'm making the Pit of Doom. Wanna help? It'll be fun. The only thing that's gonna fall in this pit is you. - Why don't you ask the new girl? - [Bean] Ivy? All she does is read. - She reads at recess. - What's wrong with Bean? She just runs around and makes noise. Just wanna wash your uniform for you! [grunts] [both] Oh. You know the rules. Three strikes, you're out. I'm running away. [whispering] Psst. Follow me. [Ivy] I just learned the spell that makes you dance forever. Mom wants you home now! [Bean] Let's sneak through the backyards to creep up on Nancy and do the spell. [both scream] [retches] [thrilling music playing] I hope you're ready to dance forever!
