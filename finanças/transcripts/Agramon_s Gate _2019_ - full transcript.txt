She is here. Things are about to get interesting. You guys are so weird. You'll see, Richie, she's really good. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm sure she can see our futures in a little glass ball. Well, I'm doing it. I'm sure you are, Maddie. It can't hurt. Hey! How you doing, you? I am pretty good. Where would you like to set up? Don't matter. Long as y'all can't see me. Well, we are so ready for you. Come on. Hey, everyone. This is Vesna. The one I've been telling you all about? Vesna, this is everyone. How y'all doing? All right. Grab your stuff, I'll show you where to go. You can set up in here. Just let us know when you're ready, okay? I will. Don't you worry about that. She's younger than I thought. Yeah? She's kinda hot. You know, like hippie hot. I don't know, I'm definitely doing it. Shut up, you dork. God! What about you, Richie? No, I'm good. Come on. Don't be such a party pooper. Okay, look, I'm... I'm honestly not a big fan of this kind of thing, okay? It's just a bunch of scammers looking to take advantage of people. All right? Come on, Richie. You asked. Okay. Hi again, everybody. Hi. A few ground rules. Don't ask me or the cards not about what you don't wanna know. Or they ain't gonna tell you none about that. About how you or anybody else gonna die. When somebody die, there's a split. Body, soul. I do medium. I try to talk to those who pass over to the other side. Now, I will try but no guarantee. So, who want to go first? Me. What you waiting for, Cher? Oh! Shut up, you guys. Seriously. Why you so against this anyway? It's just for fun. It's stupid. Come on, relax a little. Whatever, Cass. It's just not my thing, okay? You know what though? Sometimes you can be a little too tight. Grab another beer and relax a bit. She just wants everyone to have a good time, Richie. Okay. That was seriously awesome. Who's next? Shit, I'll go. Baby, all you. That was so awesome, you guys have to try that. I told you, she's the real deal. Oh, whatever. Don't be such an ass. Okay, how about you go in there and then tell me afterwards that she didn't get you right. Come on, Cassidy. Here's how it works, okay? They read your body language, they throw out something vague, and then they milk it, right? They follow your suggestions based on what you respond to. Look, I honestly don't know how you believe in this. Okay, then do it. I don't know, let's see if she can't show you your past. Yeah, Richie, put your money where your mouth is. Couldn't you do something normal like a sex toy party? Look, don't even try to get out of it, okay? Unless. Unless you're a scaredy pants. You know what? That's it. You are chicken. That's the dumbest thing I've heard in my life. If it's so dumb, then do it. I'll go with you and hold your hand if you're scared, honey bear. You're crazy. You're crazy. You're double crazy. That is some voodoo shit. All right, who's up? Richie? Are you really gonna chicken out? Come on, babe. Hey. Can we talk to family members? We can try. I have always wanted to do that. We could do a seance. Okay, y'all, hold hands. I feel the spirits. I already feel the spirits, they're waiting to talk to you. Now remember, don't let go of your partner's hands. Spirit, oh spirit, who are here to see family and friends, come to me, come through me. Spirit, oh spirit, who are here to see family and friends, come to me, come through me. Who this? Anybody here lost a papa or mama? Yeah, like almost everyone probably? Shh! Mama in the last year? Yeah, me. Her name Beth or Beth Anne? Elizabeth. Yeah. Oh my god. Grandma, is that you? Tina, she misses you. But she's happy. She's with Grandpa and Jimmy now. Tell her I love her? She hears you. Hold up. I feel another one. Wanna come through real bad. Anyone lost a daddy? Richie. What? I think that's you. Shh. That's you. Shh. It's been a while but... It'll be different this time. Richard. Oh shit, what the fuck was that? Oh god. It's bullshit. Baby. Are you okay? Cassidy, that shit is not funny. All right? I told you my dad was crazy. I told you, and not like the fun, not like the funny kind of crazy, not like, like "The Shining" kind of crazy, okay? He almost killed my mom. I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with this. I didn't do anything. Whatever, Cass. Baby, look. I don't know what happened in there but I don't think that was your daddy. Yeah, no shit. Whatever it was, it pushed through. And I don't know. Take this. What's that? It'll keep the bad juju away. Seriously? I know you can't see this for what it is right now, but... Okay. Honestly, I think you've done enough and you should probably just leave, okay? Okay. You be careful, you. We will. Is he okay now? Yeah. I mean, I think so. What happened last night scared the shit out of me. I can't handle this kind of shit. I can't even watch a scary movie without hiding under the fucking blankets, it's ridiculous. I know. What happened? Honestly, I have no idea. Was it his dad? I don't know. Why is he so uptight about all this? I'm not really sure I should tell. I mean, it's a really personal and sensitive topic for Richie. Cassie, this didn't just happen to Richie, this happened to all of us. I know. Look, I'm not gonna say a word. Well, um, I guess his dad went all Amityville and tried to kill his mom and Richie. No way. Yeah. And Richie, he never told me all the details and I don't want to push, but I guess he saved his mom and killed his dad. I mean, his dad like tried to kill his mom, so he shot him. And even worse, his mom, she's in a mental institution and she has been ever since. She won't even talk to Richie. That's fucking nuts. Yeah. Look, Maddie, please, don't, don't say anything to anyone, all right? Not even Cameron. At least until we figure this out. Look, I'm not gonna say a word, I promise. Thank you. Of course. Cassie? Honey, is that you? Baby? Are you home? Cassidy? Richie. Hi. You're home early. Yeah. Maybe I can make some of that stuff up to you now, huh? Yeah, maybe. Hey, I heard some, some noises. From the bedroom, I hope. Maybe. I, I don't know. Okay. How was your day? It was fine. I mean, it wasn't bad. Hey, I should go. I should go check on whatever that was. Spirit. This is my home. You are not welcome here. Oh. You wanna do a little dance? Huh? You wanna do a little? Hello? Come over, Cher. What's up? There's a spirit, he been messing with me a little bit. Okay, I can make time tonight so... Okay, Cher. She's got a gun! There's, there's a woman with gun, she's coming. What was that? I don't know. Did you leave the bedroom door open? I don't think so. Hey, be careful. What are you doing? Shh. Just... Okay? I'm just trying not to take any chances, okay? Yeah, in case someone throws you a baseball? Baby, what if there was someone in our house? Yeah, or a draft. Did you use all the hot water again? I just showered! Yeah, for like half an hour. So I enjoy a hot shower, sue me. Whatever. Was that you? No, that was from the basement. Is Dad home? I don't think so. So who else would it be? I don't know. You should go look. No way, you're older, you go look. Dude, I am freezing. I just got out of the shower or I would. Let's go together. I don't see anything. Let's go. So tell me, what's so urgent? Something happened at work last night. What? I did a couple readings and I got everybody together to do a seance. I don't know. Something pushed through. Like a spirit? Your guess is as good as mine. But I'll tell you one thing. Whatever it was, it was stronger than anything I've ever felt before. Stronger than, well, you know. Huh. Took me over. Went through me, went through all of us. It's like we set it free or something. No human spirit can do such a thing. It must be a, a demon or a poltergeist. Did you have your items? I always do, Cher. This is too layers for most to push through. See? No. I hope you are right. I hope you're wrong. Be careful, baby. I'm armed! I'm warning you! Baby, what's going on? I don't, I don't know. The cupboards are... Can you hear me? They're... It's the fucking gypsy woman you brought into our house. She... Baby? It could be your dad. Baby, what are you doing? Are you okay? I'm, uh, I'm going to go see my mom. Are you sure? You understand that what happened last time will likely happen again? I know. Jeez, the last time you went, you were messed up for days. I just really hope that you're putting some thought into this. Yeah, I know. I know, I know, babe, but I need to go. Baby. I don't know. I do. I'll see you soon. Oh no. What the fuck? Hello? Did you get my texts yet? Not yet. You see what is going on with me, Cher? Oui. What the hell do I do? I'm not sure but let me find out. You stay safe now, you hear? All right. Hi. Hey, Richie, how are you? Doing fine. How's my mom doing? She's still the same, sweetie. Just be gentle, okay? Okay, thank you. Hi, Mom. It's your son. Richie. You. You're not my son. I think... I think he's back. I mean, not him exactly but his energy or something. I need to know what happened, Mom. I need to know what really happened to him. Please. I thought maybe, maybe you'd want to help me. Like I helped you. I guess not. It's fine. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry. You are him. You should go, Richie. You are him. I'm sorry. - She needs her rest. - He is you, you are him. She needs to settle down. He is you, he is you, he is you, you are him, you are him, you are him, you are him, you are him, you, you are. So it looks like Abaddon or Agramon. Maybe even. Not very good news, I'm afraid. How would we find out? In due time. There are always signs. I'm gonna call the people at the party. No, no. There's a chance they're not involved. How would they know? Hello? Hey, Cher, it's me, Vesna. I'm gonna put you on speaker phone. Hey, I was just thinking of calling you. I kind of had a feeling. Any trouble over there? Yeah. You could say that. We're actually at a hotel right now. Can't really afford to stay much longer though but I'm not going home. I got you, Cher, but the kind of stuff we're dealing with, I don't think it matters where you go. I need to see you, Cher. Okay. When? No matter, but the sooner the better. Oh, and I'd like to bring my partner. He gonna like your place. Really? Why? He's special. More so than me, Cher. Okay, yeah. I'd, I'd rather not go later on though. You know, after dark? How's about five? All right. Bye bye. Hope you're ready for this. Dad? I don't have a good feeling on this. Me neither. Suppose we have no other chance. Still gonna follow you no matter where you go. Rich, Cass, this is the partner I been telling you about. Zeb. Nice to meet you. Well, I hope you can get rid of this thing. I hope so too, Cher. Let's go inside. It is not here. What? Zeb? Where exactly were you when it happened? I was sitting right here. And I was here, next to Richie. And what did it say? She, she said something like "It'll be different this time, Richie." But it did not sound like her. In the voice of your father? Not exactly, no. It didn't quite sound like her either. Your father, was he a bad man? You could say that, sure. If you don't mind, what did he do? Um, I really prefer not to talk about it. It happened a long time ago, I was 12, so. Baby, you have to. Okay, um. Long story short, one week he went nuts. He got violent, he tried to kill my mom and me. And one night when he was strangling her, I shot him with his own gun. What have you done? She said that I was becoming like him and I lost her too. She's been in a mental institution ever since. I'm sorry, Richie. I am convinced it is not your father we are dealing with. But I think I know who it is. Who? His name is Agramon. And he's powerful, so powerful he can fully manifest. And he feeds on your fear. Jesus, what are you talking about? You mean like a demon or something? No, not like a demon, but one of the very worst. Some people say Baal is the devil's right hand. I will argue that Agramon is his left hand and that the devil is left-handed. So, what? We fight back. We stay together, we stay strong. I think I saw him today. What? In Pontiac, I was on my way to pick up Cassie and it looked like my dad. I followed him but he kinda disappeared. He's already powerful enough he can manifest, then we are in for a battle and we should leave. Now? Vesna. A holy place. Follow me. And we, your fear is what strengthens him. How's this shit not gonna? I'm sorry, this stuff not going to scare us? Oh, it will, my babe. It will. But what he's saying is you got to feed the monster as little as possible. You know, starve the fuck. Hope he moves on, you know? Exactly. Okay, but isn't there something, I mean something else, like something more we could do? Besides essentially hoping that he gets bored? First, you should call all your friends. He may or may not have gone after them yet but when you resist, he most likely will. I'm sorry, they're in danger too? Oui. And wherever you go, he will likely follow you. So. The motel isn't safe. I'm afraid nowhere is all that safe right now. I will talk to some friends and see what else we can do, but for now you stay strong, you stay together. You keep that strength from him, okay? This is the key. Hey, babe, how was your day? It was pretty good actually. Just got promoted to... What was that? I don't know. Is anyone here? No. What the hell? Is anything missing? I don't know. Cam, this is nuts. Babe, I'm scared. Everything is gonna be okay, baby. Hey. Hey. So about the party the other night. Yeah. And how it ended. Something came through. Well, that explains all this shit. What? It looked like somebody broke in, nothing's missing, and it happened while we were here. Shit. You guys should come over. To your place? I don't think so. You think it matters where you are? I see your point. I'll be there in 15. I know you're here. I can hear him, I can feel him. The depths of hell on you, Carter. I'm not afraid of you. You can take my life. But not my son. Just a dream, Sharon. Sharon, it's just a dream! He was there, he was there! It was just a dream, it was just a dream. No! It was a dream. Demon. You are not welcome here. I am not afraid of you, demon. You don't like that, do you? So let me get this right. If we aren't scared of him, he can't hurt us. I don't think it's quite that simple. What they said was the more scared we are, the stronger it gets. But, um, they did give us this. It is the amulet for St. Michael. It represents courage. You guys believe in that stuff? Like you, Richie? Come on, man, you of all people? At this point, Cam, what do I have to lose? No, I'm with you on that. Do you guys have any more? No. But we do have these. They should help. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Honey, is there anybody else coming over? Hang on. I got your back. Who's there? Who's there? Open the door, please! It's Mom. I'm gonna open it. You crazy? Richie, don't. Mom? Get inside. Come inside. He, he came for me. What happened? Mom? Richie. What? How did she get out? I don't know. I'm still trying to figure it out, Richie. What are you doing here? Who to pass to? You or your mom? What are you talking about? You know exactly what I mean, Richie. No. No, I don't. And... Nothing, nothing passed, you, you did this. That's all there is to it, there's nothing else. I saw it. I'm pretty sure it passed to you. Admit it. You felt the urge. If you were to spare me, I could teach you. We'd be unstoppable. Richie. Don't let him fool you like he fooled me. He's trying to infect your mind. Look at him. He's done. Don't let him in. Don't let him in, you're stronger than you think, Richie. Richie. Listen to her? She hasn't been there for you. She's the one who's been accusing you. - Shut up. - Richie. Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up. Dead. You're dead. So are you. Oh my god! Where's my mom? What? My mom, where'd she go? She was right there. Mom? Hey, I'm sorry. I should have called when she got here. Did she come back? My mom. My mom, Sharon. Sharon Stann. I can't find her, did she come back? Sharon? She's in her room. No. No, no, no, no. She must have gotten out or something because she was here. I gave her breakfast and meds this morning myself. Is, is this Richie? Yes? Are you absolutely certain? Yes. She's been here all night, Richie. Um. So she's there. They said she never left. How is that even possible? Who the hell did we let into our house last night? I think we both know who. You know, this is so fucked up! These amulets. What was all this for? So what, this thing can shape-shift into anything it wants at any time? How the hell are we supposed to know who's real or not? Next card up all gonna be you. What was that? Gotta redo card. Something not right. I'm guessing the card don't want to show today. Maybe we can do something else. I mean, I really just wanted the regular reading. But I guess. It'll be on the house. Something wrong? Not you, Cher. Just something not right. Oh my god. What is going on? I guess that's all I needed to see to know today's not the day. You're all going to die. You're sure it's Agramon? All the signs points towards it. That's not good. And it is already strong, strong enough to manifest. So there's no other way out? Not that I can see. We stay and we fight. Well, I have something. Something that might work. This. This is the demon killer. And you think this will work? I do. It's supposed to have been blessed by two disciples and they say it's what killed Dracula. The budget meeting very soon. Of course. Yeah. Maybe Mike and the guys can meet... Sorry, excuse me. Rich. Can we talk for a minute? Sure, Richie, what's up? You all right? Look like you seen a ghost. I need to take the rest of today off. If that's okay, I'll make it up to you this weekend. Sure. Is there anything I can help with? Trust me, Ben, you don't want to. I don't know what that means but, uh, I'll take your word for it. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Hey, um, I'm here to see Mrs. Sharon Stann. Miss Stann, how are you? All right. Mind signing there for me? Yeah. You know, she's had a rough time these last couple days. So I'll go in there with you, okay? Okay, yeah, thank you. Hey, Sharon. It's Cassie. Well, god, things have gotten pretty crazy. Is there anything that you can tell us? Please, Sharon. I don't want it to use Richie's dad against us. People's lives are at stake here, Sharon! Okay, she doesn't need more stress. Cassidy, you're gonna have to calm down or leave, okay? You don't understand. He is after us and he's getting stronger. I said calm down. You listen to me. It passed from Carter to Richie. He's here to claim him. Best get away. No, no, no. You see, that's not an option for me. I'm gonna stand by Richie just like you should have! Cassidy, let's go, come on. You're all gonna die! Do you hear me? You all gonna die! He is him, him is he. He is him, him is he. He is him, him is he. He is him, him is he. Look, I don't know what's going on here but this isn't acceptable. You're right, none of this is acceptable! I think we got a shot at ending this. Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. You say we have a shot at ending it, huh? Yes. With this. Oh, wow. This legit? I got it from Killian, so I'd say so. I bet you been around, my babe. I'm gonna give Cassidy a call. Tell her we have the good news. Hey. Bonjour. We might have something to help put an end to this once and for all. Time to die. What the fuck? Don't be scared, my ass, baby. I'm freaking out right now! Babe, we have to be strong. Remember, this thing, this thing feeds off of our fear. I don't know if I can right now, okay? You have to. I'm going to kill you. What the? I can't, I can't do this, I can't do this. Gotta walk. Screw this. Stop. What the hell is going on? You killed me, Richie. Your own father. You were killing Mom. I was angry. But you know I would never kill her. That's bullshit. If I wouldn't have shot you, you would've killed her. No, Richie. I'm your father. And I love you. I would never hurt you or your mother. We should go to her. She needs to see us together. It'll help her. Come on. You're not my father. Yes, I am. No. I know who you are. And I'm not gonna deal with you. Demon. Richie. Would you hurt a little girl? You doing all right, you? No, no, no actually. I just saw my dead father. And then it wasn't him and I tried to hit it and it disappeared. There was just some smoke. It looks like we got here just in time. I'd say so. So what's your idea? Not so much an idea but now we have this. We got it from a close friend who knows a thing or two about demons. And he calls this the demon killer. And that'll work? If Killian says it does, I will take his word for it. Cool. That's, that's good. Because this thing, not so much. My gun. It's inside. Well, what good is it there? Hello, it's in the frickin' safe. Well, that sucks. Don't get mad at me. You're the one who told me I had to start using the safe because you wanted to have frickin' kids. Look, I know what we said, okay? But right now, that's not gonna help us. Hang on. My nerves are shot. Yeah, this is some messed up shit. Can we please go back to Cassie and Richie's? You know, as screwed up as that sounds, I think that's probably the best... Shh. Only way in is through the front door. You're sure this'll work? No, but it is the best we got. Show yourself. I'm not afraid of you. No, no, no, no, no. I, I faced you before. And I'll face you again. Your reign of terror is over. I belong to God now. I belong to God. My soul is his. Maybe so. But I'm not done with you. You can still feel pain. And when I'm done with you, Richie's next. And trust me when I say this. His soul is up for grabs. He'll stand up to you. Maybe. At first. You pushing him away all these years has made him weak. What a failure of a mother you are. You can't even protect your own son. He's stronger than you think. Yeah. That's why you're here. You can't get to him. You're weak. Am I? Do we even know if he'll show up? Oui. Eventually. I can't just sit here and stare at a door. Anyone else hungry? No. No. No. All right, well, I'm gonna go get myself something to eat then. Hey, let us in! Shit, that's my friend. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, wait. How do we even know it's them? Look, I got this. Is everything okay? I don't know. Take this and put it in your hand. What? Now you. Are you guys okay? Give me your hand. Yeah. Just tension overload from all this craziness. Oh my god. Hey, who's here? Tiff, who's here? What? I saw someone come into your room and seriously, do not lie to me. If you're smoking pot with Claire again, I'm telling Mom. What are you talking about? Who's that? Dad? What, sweetie? Dad, there's someone in the house. Dad? Hey, sweetie. I think they're looking for ya. Oh shit. Go! How long is this gonna take? A couple of days, a week at the most. Okay. Well, I got to work. Yeah. Me too. I think we better stick together. Yeah, well. I live in the real world with real bills, so I can't lose my job. Sure. I'll be back after work. Maddie? Feel free to stay as long as you like. Cam, you can pop back over after work. Until we figure this thing out. Baby. Promise me you'll be careful. Yeah. Hey, wait up. Wanna give me a lift to my car? Yeah, no problem. Haven't heard anything in a while. He's gone? Well, I'm not opening it. Did you think? I don't know. I mean, it looked... I never even saw Mom. Okay, um, hang on, just. Okay. Wait. Okay. Hey, don't, Tiffany. Tiff. Tiff, you're fine, come here. Okay. I know. But hey, we have to go, okay? We have to go, okay? Okay. Sleeping in today, huh? That's a first. Oh my god! Oh my god, Sharon, no! What happened? Get us security. Saint Mary's south ward. We got an apparent homicide. No, she cold. She been dead a while. Hey, you gonna be okay? Yeah. You? I guess we'll see, right? Be safe. You too. This has never happened before. And you were staffed all night? Yes. And we have the footage of them doing rounds, I just... I just don't understand. I'll need a copy of this. Sure. Anything else you can think of? No. I mean, I mean I had a strange call from Richie the other night. But it's always strange dealing with them, so I didn't think anything of it. Richie. That's her son, right? Mm-hmm. Hey, Simmons. Yeah? Come here. What you got? Look at this. What was that? I don't know. She said she'd never seen it do this before. Who had access to this last night? Security and the night nurses, I suppose. Gonna need a list of everyone that worked last night as soon as possible, please. Sure. I'll get it off the schedule for you. Visitors, deliveries, anyone that came in and out. And what about this Richie thing? He says she came over late at night a couple nights before but she was here all night. It was strange. Even his wife came and said something. I'm not sure what it was, but it upset Sharon. Can you pull the footage from that night? Sure, I can get that for you, but I don't see why. Yeah, I know she was here. I gave her her meds that morning at 6:00 a.m. when I came in to do rounds. Can we look? Sure. Hold on a sec. Let me just. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on here. I'll be needing that too. As a matter of fact, just give me the last two weeks of footage. I still don't understand. I mean, this, this has never happened before. I apologize. Hello? Richie? Yeah? I'm afraid I have some bad news. Okay. Your mom passed away last night. What, how? We don't know. Oh my god. I'm so sorry, Richie. Look, I know you didn't feel close to your mom because of her condition, but I know how she was when you left. And I know she loved you. I'm sorry. In the next few days, you'll hear from the police. They're trying to figure out what happened. Do you remember the other night, when you said she came over? Well, the footage is all messed up. From that night and even last night. What do you mean? It's static. And the screen is blurred out. If I didn't know any better, I'd say it was tampered with. Are you saying she might have been killed? No, I'm not saying that. But it's very strange, to say the least, you know? Okay. If you don't mind, I'd like to come and collect her things? The police are taking most everything. You'll have to get it from them. Okay. Richie. Look, I'm so sorry for your loss. Hey, Dave, can we talk for a second? Sure. Give us a moment. Of course. Um. So my mom just passed. Oh, man. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that, man. Mm-hmm. So if it's not too much to ask, I'd... I'd like a couple days off? Of course. Family first, Richie. Family first. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, no problem, man. I'll go. Detective Blackwell, LLPD. This is Detective Simmons. Is Richard Stann home? You mean Richie? No. He's at work. You're his wife. No. I'm a friend. I am. I take it you haven't talked to Richard, Richie, today? Why do you say that? His mother was found dead this morning. Oh my god. I'm sorry. We don't have a lot of details at this point, but we're not ruling out foul play. Um, I have a feeling that this is going to sound really crazy, but... We are having some really strange things happening here. It's a long story. Time is something I do have. Okay, you know, come inside. Let's have a seat. I know that this all sounds insane but, you know, when you look around here, you will find a perfectly normal couple, okay? Blocking demons off with salt to their house. Yeah, I have to admit, it sounds pretty wild. Do you believe in God? Yeah, sure. I mean, I believe in some God. Not sure what that matters or what that means. Do you believe in spirituality? Sure. So then you believe in spirits and now it's not so far-fetched, no? What I've found is people do bad things, sometimes because of what they believe and sometimes because they're just flat out sick people. But that's it. It's people. It is people under the influence. See, there's a spiritual world war going on out there. Is anyone going to answer that? That thing killed our parents. What? It killed them! Baby, it's getting worse. That thing, it just killed Natalie's mom and dad too! Okay. I don't know what your plan is but we need to step it up. Oui? Do you need a plan B? Mr. Stann, I apologize for taking up so much of your time. Killian. What do you have for me? Well, I was trying to think of what to do. And then I remembered Padre Martinez found this at the Gate of Erebus. He was convinced that the demon was trapped in it. It could be nothing, but it could be worth it. Well, from everything I have seen and heard, I believe we have opened Agramon's gate right here. So we need every bullet in our gun possible, if you know what I mean. Well, I'm glad I could be of help. Get away, get away! You're all going to die. Who's there? Richie, open the door. It's Mom. It is not her. Richie. Richie. Listen up. Open this door right now! Can we, can we keep it outside? That is plan A, yeah. Okay, what's plan B? Let's hope plan A works. Maybe we can do this another way. - Listen to this. - Yeah. Richard John Stann killed his father in 1999. He was 12. He shot him. It says his father had been acting strange and had become violent and in one of his rages, attempted to kill his wife Sharon when Richard came to her aid and shot his father. Are you completely sure about this, Killian? It is the least confrontational way. He's strong already. He's going to break through and enter eventually. Yeah, but this doesn't feel safe. At this point, my friend, nothing is safe. Shit. Taking a sleeping pill. I'm gonna be done with this. You guys can handle this shit on your own. Maddie, are you nuts? I'd rather be asleep than getting ripped apart. I'm literally considering this whole bottle. No, that's not going to happen, okay? Have you lost your mind? I'm done with this. Hello? Who's there? Detective Blackwood again. Can we come in? Give me your hand. What? You're good. This is going to sound crazy, but I think I have to do this. Have to do what? We open the seal, we let it in with me, and I kill it. Why don't we do what I said? I think it's safer. Besides, the demon can't lie to us. You wanna lose the other eye? Cam should have been here by now. So much crazy things are happening, who knows what's going on. I hope he's okay. He hasn't answered any of my calls. Hey, focus your energy on here and now, okay? Okay. It's ready. The last time we tried talking to the dead, this whole damn mess started. I sincerely hope you know what you're doing. As do I. This is the least confrontational way to get him. It's worth a shot. Spirit, oh spirit. Come to me. Come through me. Who are you? Hey. It's me. I'm fine. Just help me up. Cannot lie to me, demon. What the hell, I thought you, I thought you said it wasn't my dad. It isn't. You said it couldn't lie. Wait, wait. In your room. Okay, that's enough, come back. That wasn't no demon. It was Carter. Your daddy's here. Yeah, can I take so many pills? No, no way. We're getting out of this alive, do you hear me? It's just a little overwhelming, you know? So what now? Now, I guess we kill it. Let me in, quickly. Quickly! Where have you been, man? Shit! Stay back. Demon, fight me. I remember you from my place. You're not as tough as you like to pretend you are. Take it easy, Cher. Everything gonna be fine.
