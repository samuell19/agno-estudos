But... You are a nurse, aren't you? What? You're working for a vet? - Yes, I had a side job. Don't worry! For that, you don't need speciaI quaIifications. Chuji... Chuji... What an oId-fashioned name... BIame it on my parents. I don't mind seeing them. That's impossibIe. My father died in Vietnam. That was said about every man who had Ieft his wife.

Who do you think you are, you piece of shit? Stop getting us into troubIe... You dirty motherfucker! You got it?! Hey, Aoyama. That's enough. That bastard was high on speed. He had his reasons to do what he did. Right? Hey, drive her home. - Yes, sir! Thank you. Who the heII are you? ReaIIy big... Yeah? She wants you to caII her back. That woman is part of my pIan. Get the car. Yes. BIank This one. - Yes. I remember... When I was a chiId, I saw them fIying above my head. When you were a chiId...? Hey... Do you know Dejima? - What? You sureIy Iearned about it at schooI. Where the foreigners Iived... Oh, you mean the one in Nagasaki? In Dejima, there was this camp, right? In Dejima? It's the onIy window open to the outside worId... I think it's just the other way round. I have to go beyond this pIace to go anywhere. Chuji! Where do you want to go, Chuji? I'II get us some juice. I've aIready arranged the making of a new wiII. It'II be ready in a month. We'II onIy have to repIace the oId wiII.... How wicked! How did you get ... such an idea? You gave me the idea of doing it. I onIy toId you that there's a wiII. I never toId you ... to forge a new wiII... ''I name ... Kenji Shindo as my successor...'' PIease don't Ieave me... Never! It's aIready morning! Good morning. Morning. What's the matter? Nothing. What's up? What? That was... That was reaIIy wonderfuI... Idiot. I know... Let me introduce a very speciaI guest here tonight. Chuji! Chuji Yonashiro. Come on! Chuji! I heard that you're good. Chuji! That was great, you're fantastic. I aImost wet my pants! What I reaIIy need now is a beer! Mother...? Is it dad? Did anything happen to dad? What? I'II give up the band and seII tofu instead! Tofu? What are you taIking about? - I saw my father. He suffered a stroke, the Ieft haIf of his body is paraIyzed. I never did anything for him. He cried when I toId him I'II take over his tofu store. Tofu store... You'II get ice coId hands, man! My kid wiII start prepschooI soon... I think I've had it my way Iong enough. What about the band? That's why I'm here. Won't you take my pIace? Me? The others think that's a good idea, too. Why? They reaIIy Iove your sound. My sound? I'm sorry! Okay! This... and that... and this... that... and this... And this one, too! There's so much to do! This and that... What's going on here? WeIcome home! What's that? I can't take it. Don't be overmodest. What's her name again? Tokiko? You two saved my Iife. This is the Ieast I can do... - That's not necessary. PIease take it, do it for me. For me, this is a matter of honor. Thank you. Women cost you a Iot of money. You can never have too much... EspeciaIIy peopIe Iike us... PeopIe who are different ... are not taken seroiusIy if they don't have any money. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. That doesn't appIy to you, you're not a member of the yakuza. Yakuza or not, you're a far better man than me. I don't know what I want, I'm totaIIy doubIe-minded. But you take your Iife in your own hands, Kenji. I bet you have a dream, haven't you? Yes. But that's not just a dream... I'II make it to the top. I don't want to be a smaII-timer for the rest of my Iife. That's not my styIe. Brother! So Iong. What is it? Do you Iike me? What? I asked if you Iike me. Yeah. I Iike you. You don't get it... WiII Very pecuIiar handwriting... A tough one to feign. I demand two percent extra charge. Good work. Hey! This Yukichi Hanamura is your boss, right? OId chap... How good is your memory? I'm oId. I don't even remember what I had for breakfast today. Everything's ready. Have you made up your mind? - Don't press me. It's quite risky. Didn't you say that you prefer a dangerous game? Kojima... Forget it. AduIt Iife is a Iot more compIicated. Can we meet next week? - Why not tonight? Next week. I'II caII you. Are you sure that this guy won't doubIe-cross us? He won't dare. He has aIways been an unIucky feIIow. He's dying with his Iiver probIem. He'II take part, be sure about that. Even when you're hundred, you stiII hunger for Iife. I'm reaIIy happy just to be with you, brother Kenji. That's enough for me. Is today Wednesday? AbsoIuteIy. That's Kitamura of the Tesshinkai gang. Why the heII did he have to kick the bucket in this area? No idea, sir. Hey, Inui. - Yes? That's the Iiver, isn't it? Isn't that the kidney? - It's the Iiver. I'm sorry. ReaIIy nice coIor... Dig this thing somewhere. Let's forget the whoIe matter. Just forget about it. How about grabbing a bite? You're Iate! I'm sorry. I'm not an earIy bird. Long time no see, Kenji... Have we met before? You idiots. You see too many movies. There's stiII one thing that I don't reaIIy understand... What is it? Hanamura's wife ... wiII change his wiII for the forged one. Then you'II kiII Hanamura and bIame it on us. And you'II be the new head. Then, returning the favour, you'II kiII our head. That'II put me at the top of our group, ... that's the accepted custom. Very simpIe, isn't it? Hey!! Why? What do you need me for? If you want to bump one of our members off, ... you won't need my heIp. You can just get him and finish him off. It's important how things proceed afterwards. As a head of each group, we can stop useIess strife. SeveraI panes may be broken and severaI punks may be dead. Then a third party wiII step in to mediate... You mean you want to enter into an aIIiance? You and me? If we both want it, things couId be that way. We spIit 60 to 40, because you're the one who has to strike first. That's why I need you. I've aIready taIked to potentiaI mediators. You have? To be head of this IocaI group is onIy the beginning... Then I can finaIIy start doing some big things. CertainIy: ... You're going to die. Do good boys Iive Ionger? Pick a smaII-timer and send him over with a gun. That Ioser won't have to kiII. A sniper wiII take care of him and Hanamura. You're a ... reaI disgrace to the yakuza. You're the ... right one to taIk... What's that? - ChocoIate. It's supposed to do me good. Want some? Yokohama - Sasebo You're doing great... Want some more stuff? I wanna take some time off. They have an eye on me. - Are you scared? No, but... I see... A girI. It seems you're having a good time... - It's not what you think. What? You have a crush? Oh man, I can see troubIe ahead of you... What about manners? ShaII I teach them to you? My IittIe Kenji! - That's me? How's your wound? Perfect. Next time I'II go straight to a vet. TeII Chuji... - What? TeII him that he's the best. So Iong. - What?! You're aIready Ieaving? I don't feeI too comfortabIe... We're a IittIe out of pIace. GynecoIogist Chuji. Good morning! Chuji! Morning... - Morning. What's up? I'm pregnant. What...? I'm pregnant! Pregnant? - Yes. Is it mine? - SiIIy. Of course! So? What do you mean, ''so''? WeII... WiII you have it? - CertainIy, yes. Dad and mom? Hey, boss! Oh, you! You're so Iate! I have some great news! - Wait a second! Let me teII you something first. Mr. Sugiyama from City Records is here. Oh, you've been here before... HeIIo! Oh, man! You simpIy don't get the point, do you? He is a scout! For what? Not basebaII pIayers. I work for a record company. Me...? I'm tired of aII that teenybopper stuff. I want to produce your sound. My sound? - There's one more hurdIe to cIear. I'II bring our chief to your next show. If he Iikes what you do, ... we'II produce you. The next show wiII be on Thursday! Of course I want to hear your opinion first. I'm ready. Sorry, but I didn't mean your opinion. Do you want to try? Thanks for coming. - Make it short. I reaIIy don't want to be seen with you. WeII... We'II do it next Thursday. - Okay. Have you decided who's going to be the one? The one to die? I have a few candidates... I'm not quite sure about it yet. I think there's an ideaI one. Somebody who's good for nothing... And now... I have to open it carefuIIy... CongratuIations, Chuji. Thanks to you. - How come? The first time I went on stage... You were the one who had taIked to Yuya about me. He saw me perform and then he got interested. That's the way it goes... Yeah, I guess. It seems you've found your way, Chuji. I've never feIt Iike this before... I'm being needed. Of course! But even if you faiI, ... I don't want you to feeI bad about it. I'II be with you. Me and the baby... Thank you. Enjoy! HeIIo? Yeah. You're doing weII, don't you? They toId me... ShouId I ask for your autograph? And ... I've heard your woman is pregnant... So? If you do me one Iast favour, ... I'II be very generous in return... I'II forget our coIIective past. It won't be good if they find out ... It might be hard to become a professionaI ... if you had deaIt with drugs before, right? What? I toId you that I see troubIe ahead of you. Thursday, 5 p.m.. We'II meet here. Don't worry. It's a breeze. WiII What's up? I was thirsty. What is it? What's the troubIe with me? I feeI so strange... Yes? HeIIo, Chuji. What's up?

Chuji? What's the matter? You're acting kind of funny. ReaIIy? I guess I'm just a IittIe nervous. I'm going out, I'II come straight to the cIub. Don't be Iate! I won't. Chuji! Do you think it's a boy? Why do you say that now? - I don't know. But... I suddenIy thought I want a boy ... who Iooks Iike you. Funny, isn't it? See you. HeIIo. This is Reiko. Is he in? HeIIo? It's me. I have something to teII you... Have you ever used a gun? Of course not! I bet you have. You're from Okinawa, aren't you? Idiot! You have a Iot of nerve. What do you want me to do? KiII him. KiII? If you puII the trigger, your past wiII be erased. It's easy enough. What a buIIshit... Idiots! If you caII me an idiot once again, I'II kiII you. Come here! Sit down.
