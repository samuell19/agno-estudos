Hello, Andrea. Yes, I know what your name is. And I also know what you're dreaming about. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) You know, Margherita, we could never thank you enough for doing this. This job has put us in a very difficult spot. (STATIC CRACKLING) This thing just turned on and off on its own. There's probably a broken wire somewhere. Unless you're telling me you think this place is haunted. Anyway, I'm going into town. Wanna come with? If you're looking for princes and princesses, you'll end up disappointed. -This place is nothing special. -You don't wanna eat the cockroach? -You wanna eat the cockroach. -No! Please! Why did you take all these photos if you didn't wanna eat it? MATTEO: Betta! (GRUNTS) Well, look at this. The freak made a couple of new friends. -You moron! -ALDO: Cut that out! -(GROANS) -RICCARDO: What was that? Hey! Aldo, it's just my phone. It belongs to the Mad Sisters. They're witches! Why are you asking us to solve this riddle? To reveal if you are the chosen ones. "Know that I live neither here nor there. "Half is what you'll see if you stare. "If you beat me, someone will soon be there." -(GASPS) Who's there? -You have to help me. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC ENDS) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (THEME MUSIC CONCLUDES) RICCARDO: We absolutely have to convince Auntie to get Wi-Fi. We can't live like this. Giulia, pass me one of those please. Giulia? -Yep. -What's wrong with you today? -Is it about those women? -No. No. So, what is it? -It's just, I was sleeping in the attic... -(WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHING) ...when I saw someone. I just looked up and he was standing by me. And... and just as suddenly, he disappeared. At first, I thought it was just you, -but then I wasn't... -I knew it. I told you it was haunted and you still wanted to sleep in there. Well, it's too late to switch with me now. That's for sure. (CHUCKLES) That's enough. It was probably just a nightmare. You should tell Aunt Margherita. (CHUCKLES) I'm sure a ghost would be great advertising for her bed and breakfast. -No. I won't tell her. -Whatever you decide. -If I were you, I wouldn't sleep in there. -ZIA: Hey, kids. How are you? Ready for your first full day in Castelcorvo? -GIULIA: Ready. -Ready. Are you ready for a little surprise? -Let's see it. -Okay. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ZIA: Here they are. Do you like them? I got them for the guests, but you can ride them whenever you want. -(CHUCKLING) -Thanks. -Much better than Wi-Fi, huh, Ricky? -(EXHALES DEEPLY) -(ZIA CHUCKLING) -Almost. (CHUCKLES) -Are the bikes not cool? -No. No. They're great obviously. -But the ostriches... -Great. Right? (CHUCKLES) -I'm working on a logo for the B&B. -Right. -(CHUCKLES) -So cool. (SPEAKING PIG LATIN) (SPEAKING PIG LATIN) -What's that? -BOTH: It means, "They're awesome." Well, thank you. Take these. -Ah! And on the helmet. -Yes. -Yeah. Amazing. -(CHUCKLES) Thank you. So, now, here is where the bell is. Here are the reflectors and the brakes. The gears should... -And then the wheels and the pedals. -ZIA: Yes. (CHUCKLING) We do in fact know what a bike is. -Thank you. -GIULIA: Thanks, Auntie. -Be careful. -(BICYCLE BELL RINGING) (UPBEAT MUSIC CONCLUDES) Are you sure we have to go up this way? -Hmm, I think we do. -Hey, you guys! Hey! -Look who it is. -Hey! RICCARDO: It's cockroach boy. -GIRL 1: Watch where you're going. -GIRL 2: Hey! Do you even know how to ride that bike, loser? -Oh, excuse me. It was only an accident. -Hey, didn't he say he was sorry? -That's really rude, you know? -Who even asked you? He's my friend, all right? Nobody has to ask me. (SCOFFS) You must be a loser too then. -(GROANS MOCKINGLY) -(BOTH GIRLS LAUGHING) Who are they? MATTEO: It's so nice to see you again. Thanks, Giulia. I'm sure by now you can see I'm not exactly the most -popular boy in Castelcorvo. -Maybe not. How would you guys feel about swapping phone numbers? Of course. If you want, we can ride our bikes together. -You can show us all around town. -Yes, yes, yes, yes. I can give you the complete guided tour of Castelcorvo. And we should probably invite Betta too. She's the expert. Sounds like a great idea, doesn't it? -Oh, I can't wait. -GIULIA: Hmm. Although, Betta doesn't have a cellphone 'cause she's against them. Betta's against cellphones? Sounds like that bully was right for calling her a freak. Shh! You don't want her to hear you calling her that. Maybe you guys haven't noticed yet, but she's a little cranky. No, we haven't noticed that. So, are you ready? (BICYCLE HORN HONKING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Look up there. There's another one. (ALL LAUGHING) (BICYCLE BELL RINGING) (UPBEAT MUSIC CONCLUDES) All right. What do you think of your first day in Castelcorvo? -It's been great. -Not bad. GIULIA: It's too bad we can't go in the castle though. Of course. Who wouldn't wanna visit a place filled with dust, garbage, and ghosts? (SLURPING) Matteo, don't listen to that. -They're just some crazy stories. -They're not crazy stories. I know that ghosts are real and you should too. Well, no need to go back inside the castle if you wanna see a ghost. -She saw one last night. -(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Quiet, dummy. I was just dreaming. The weird thing was that when it happened, the clock radio had an impossible time. -23:61. -Seriously? That's the witching hour. It's the time when ghosts come back to life to walk the earth. Matteo, don't get excited. Giulia said so herself, it was a dream. -Definitely. -MATTEO: I knew we should have never gone inside the Mad Sisters' garden yesterday. They must have put a curse on us all or something. Why don't you stay at our place tonight? We can stay up and tell scary stories and find out if Giulia was right. A sleepover, you mean? Yeah. All right. I just have to ask my parents and prepare myself. -You're coming. Betta, will you? -Hmm. Okay, sure. But I'm warning you, ghosts aren't something I believe in. -Okay. Let's go. -RICCARDO: What? -GIULIA: What's wrong? -RICCARDO: My... -my bike is stuck. -(LAUGHS) It's a flat tire. (BETTA LAUGHING) -Want a hand or have you got a tutorial? -No. I'll do it myself. Thanks. Hmm. -Uh. Betta, you wanna ride with me? -Sure. Why not. -See you later. -GIULIA: Later. -Want some help? -No. No. It's okay. I'll figure it out. All right then, if you're good. I'll drop my things off at home and ride around some more. See you later. MAN: First, we use the levers to remove the tire from the rim. -Next, insert this piece between the... -Fine. Great. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) -(GASPS) Oh, Sorry. -Oh, sorry. Uh. It's my fault. I didn't see you. But we have seen each other. Uh, yesterday when I was... You were sneaking in the Mad Sisters' garden. I know. Yeah. Um, no. Uh. We were looking for, um, our friend's cell phone he lost there and... And then you saw them. -Did they say anything? -Uh. Yeah. But nothing important really. Be careful with those two. -They're both witches. -I don't believe in that kind of thing. Whatever you say. -I guess I'll see you around. -Um, yeah. See you. -BETTA: Everything was delicious. -ZIA: Thank you. I have so many great ideas for this B&B. Do you two like ostriches or kangaroos? Aren't they just the cutest with those funny, little pockets? I mean, just look at Matteo. He has more pockets than a whole kangaroo family. -(LAUGHS) -MATTEO: Hey. I think this jacket is the perfect thing to take on an adventure. -Each pocket is full of useful things. -Well, let's see. Say you're in the woods and you encounter Bigfoot. -What do you got for that? -A Bigfoot? It's a type of ape-man that they say lives in the American wilderness. Exactly. In the American wilderness, not in Castelcorvo. All right. Then the Italian cousin of Bigfoot. (ZIP WHIZZING) This is what I got. A portable anti-Bigfoot. -(DEVICE SCREECHES) -BETTA: Please! -GIULIA: Matteo! -Turn that thing off now! Fair enough. Around here, you won't see any Bigfoot. The worse you'll run into is a little field mouse. That's gross. First ghosts, now mice. I can't wait for Mom and Dad to take us back to the city. -I would never live in the city. -Why? Because here I feel more free. I do whatever I want. There are only three things you can do here. They're ride a bicycle, ride a bicycle, and maybe ride a bicycle. I wanted to ask you, how many hours did it take you to fix that flat tire? Hey, I just met an interesting guy today. -BETTA: Was he cute? -GIULIA: He was tall, had blue eyes, and he was dressed totally in black. Strange. But overall, a pretty striking guy. Do you know who he is? Can't place him. Sorry. -(CHUCKLES) I sense an incoming crush. -GIULIA: Stop it. Look at what I found in the basement the other day. Tons of board games. These things were all the rage when I was your age, -especially the Goose Game. -"The Goose Game." (CHUCKLES) If you kids don't like that one, there are plenty of other choices down there. Auntie, thanks a lot for the thought. But we already have the night planned out. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) While we wait for the witching hour, it's time to start getting scared. I'm going to tell a story that is extremely terrifying. There was a video game. It came out ten years ago. Nothing special. A classic point-and-click. What's a point-and-click? Are you serious right now? It's just a type of game you play with only the mouse. Not exactly. Anyway, this video game had a secret level. Only the very best players were able to get to it. It was a very difficult and scary level. There was a rumor that whoever reached it... they disappeared. They vanished. Poof. Into thin air. -That's not very scary. -What do you mean? (SCOFFS) That's one of the most famous, scary stories on the internet. Everybody knows those stories never happened. (SCOFFS) I've got one. Have you guys ever heard anything about... the local were-rabbits, -BETTA: Rabbits? -RICCARDO: Rabbits? -(LAUGHS) -MATTEO: Were-rabbits. They're actually terrifying. When the moon is full, I'll come to get you, then I'll eat you along with my carrot stick so watch out. (ALL LAUGH) I have a scary story for everybody. It's the story of the exiled. "The exiled"? They say there are evil spirits that have been exiled to be in far away, unreachable places. Sometimes, however, they escape those places. If you happen to meet one, it'll make your bones feel like they're ice cold. My aunt saw one once. This is what happened to her. My bones feel cold. I think it's getting to me already. It was a hot day. Out on a walk, my aunt met an old lady. She knew my aunt. The lady pulled her aside and asked if she would go into the woods with her. She said my aunt's parents were there waiting for her. But then she noticed, all of a sudden, she started to feel very cold. And then she noticed the lady's eyes. Both of them were completely frozen, like icicles. As soon as she saw that, my aunt ran. -So that old lady had been exiled. -No. But they can enter the bodies of whoever looks them in the eyes. That's how they trick people and get their trust. No. That never happened. Do you think it did? No. Of course not. It's just a story. Just like yours. Except yours was stupid. RICCARDO: Like yours was any better. Wait, guys. It's already past midnight. You see? Looks like you were only dreaming, Giulia. I'm going to the bathroom. If the ghost gets here late, can you guys ask him to wait a little bit for me please? I'm sorry, but if you think werewolves are scary, -why can't were-rabbits be scary too? -(BETTA AND GIULIA CHUCKLING) GIULIA: And what would they look like? "Know that I live neither here nor there. "Half is what you see if you stare. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) "If you beat me, someone will soon be there." I solved the riddle. Door is the answer. -(PANTS) -(PANTS) (PANTS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) We should move it. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) It's locked. BETTA: Can you see anything? Absolutely nothing. It's pitch-black. "If you beat me, "someone will soon be there." That's it. We have to knock. (WOMAN WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) ANDREA: Betta. No way. -The ghost is here. -No. I... I'm not a ghost or anything. Betta, you don't remember me, do you? I'm Andrea. I'm your brother. You're my brother? You won't be able to remember me. That's the curse of the Stria. -It's the curse of the what? -The Stria. She is an evil witch who lives in the Nowhere, a place outside time and space. She kidnaps children and lures them back there with false promises. By using her curse, she can remove every trace of that child from the real world. Uh. I'm sorry. I don't know you. It's just my mom and dad never told me about having a brother. That's just how the curse works. All the memories vanish. Your memories as well as mine. But then how come you remember Betta? Because I fought back. Once I managed to sneak inside of a room. It was a forbidden room. That's where the Stria keeps all the memories she's stolen. You don't believe me, right? (INHALES SHARPLY) When you were little, you always wanted to do puzzles with me. I was afraid you'd lose the pieces, so I wouldn't let you. But once you started crying, I'd always end up giving in. You have to believe me. You have to help me escape from the Nowhere. We can use that door to get there. But you'll need the keys to open it, and both of them are hidden. But you need to be careful. The Stria is also looking for the keys. Once upon a time, they belonged to her, but then they were stolen and hidden in Castelcorvo. They can only be found by the chosen ones. "The chosen ones." That's exactly what the Mad Sisters said. Uh. What can we do then? The Stria is always talking about an old game, called The Knights of Castelcorvo. -Try to find it. It's important. -(WOMAN WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) It's the Stria. She's coming. -Betta... -(WOMAN CONTINUES WHISPERING) ...please remember me. (GASPS) (GASPS) (SIGHS) Impossible. Somebody pinch me. I wanna make sure that wasn't all a dream. No, it was real. We couldn't all be having the same exact dream. (PANTS) -The card is different. -MATTEO: It is? The old riddle is gone and there's a new one here. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) "I keep treasures within my walls. Open me without fear to have it all. "I am silent, but from me nothing is concealed. "If I could speak, a thousand secrets would be revealed." RICCARDO: How do we explain this to Auntie? Uh. Let's try to push the bookcase back. -(WHISPERING) Quiet. -(ALL GRUNTING) GIULIA: Almost. -MATTEO: Like that? -GIULIA: Yeah. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) -That's right. -How was it? Everything turned out fine, but you know how I am. -I sure do. -I'm just an anxious person. Betta, darling, what's that? Look at that, the family photo album. Mom, Dad, -I have a question that's very important. -Well, what is it? Have I... um, ever had a brother? (CHUCKLES) What brother? What are you talking about, Betta? Nothing. Never mind. Forget I said anything. I guess it was just a stupid question. Come on inside with us. Don't you have homework? -Yes. -BETTA'S MOM: Let's go work on that then. BETTA: Coming. (SIGHS) -GIULIA: Did you find anything? -BETTA: Nothing. -I've even asked my parents. -RICCARDO: What did they say? They just looked at me like I was totally crazy. But I've thought about this, and I'm positive that he has to be my brother. Did you notice when he is thinking, he touches his ear right here like this? And whenever he gets a new idea, he snaps his fingers, just like I do. That's good. Even though you've forgotten him, there are still clues you can observe. BETTA: Exactly. GIULIA: For example, Riccardo does a lot of the same things I do. -(CHUCKLES) -Afraid not. BETTA: No. I can feel it. I think he's really telling us the truth. It's not a trick from the Stria. There's no way we're gonna leave him there. This isn't the first story I heard about the Stria and I'm not sure that I ever wanna meet her. You know what? I've had enough. I'm tired of just doing what grown-ups want us to do. You do this, and do that, and go to Castelcorvo. -I'm sorry, but why are you saying this? -Just look at it this way. (CHUCKLES) The Stria is just another adult making decisions for us. She takes you to the Nowhere, shows you how cool it is, then keeps you there forever. But we're not trapped there yet. Was it your decision to come to this place? -No. -Okay. Then you understand it. 'Cause if you were trapped in the Nowhere, I'd do anything to get you out. So, you guys will help me then? -Of course. -Yeah. Let's do it. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) GIULIA: Come on, Matteo. I mean, what are we gonna do without your gadgets? The Stria. Please. All right. Fine. Betta, you can count on me. Thanks. Thank you all so much. Andrea, we're coming to help out. (CHUCKLES) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (THEME MUSIC ENDS)
