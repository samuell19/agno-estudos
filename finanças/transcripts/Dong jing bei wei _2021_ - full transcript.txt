Before 18, there were only two people in my life My father and my brother Our family had one goal in life Which is to find the lost treasure That belonged to our ancestor 300 years ago I've searched all the places Around the Liuqiu area There's nothing here Are we going to move again? Yes What coordinates should we add to our names this time? Start from Dongjing (longitude) 120 BeiWei (latitude) 22 Memorize these coordinates If one day, I don't return from my trip The coordinates will be where you start My classmates say that Yen ShiQi was a pirate Pirates are criminals We are the descendants of Yen ShiQi Pirates... True pirates are the people... Who knows how to get along with the ocean Understood? After 18 My life has been about waiting Waiting for Dad Waiting for DongJing I have waited without any doubt (Blood Of The Blue) You forget about time when you are out on the sea I'd forget how long it has been since I last saw Dad and DongJing Sailing alone on the sea Isn't such a bad thing But you'd forget where you are You'd forget how to talk Dad I've searched all the spots you marked on the map I found nothing but debris What did I do wrong? I make money just to get back to the sea When I'm not on treasure hunts And there are no diving tourists I'd smuggle to make ends meet Over here! This has been my life Until one day... Hello? Hey, BeiWei Hi, Hong Come over when you have time But I am leaving for Tainan Going for another treasure hunt? The Xiamen Environmental Information people are coming A blogger is also coming along to promote Penghu tourism Stay around this week - But... - Deal These were all collected from the sea? These, too? Rich people went gambling on the high seas and left these What's wrong? I am trying to figure out What kind of trick they are using against the top players My name is Cheng Lan I am with the Xiamen Environmental Information You are that famous blogger? My name is Yen BeiWei BeiWei means the North latitude Sorry You are part of the reason Why I came with them this time Yen BeiWei! Get inside! What are you waiting for? OK Cheers, everybody Come on, let's eat Mr. Hong prepared so much food for us Don't waste any Welcome, eat more please Thank you This time, we would like to learn about The driftwoods and marine litters How do you handle with this problem? This is what we'd like to look into We want to set up some interception points in the ocean To prevent further marine damage We could also use the ghost nets BeiWei Don't forget to take care of the guests Your glass is empty Aren't you going to have a drink with the lady? Sure Let's all drink! Pick up your glass! You can beat him Once she picks up her glass... Hold on, pass the bottle I'll do it! Now you're in trouble Cheers! BeiWei, why don't you... Show Cheng Lan around town? Sure, why not? The island with the shape of two hearts sounds pretty The "Twin Hearts Stone Weir" You'll have to take a ferry to Chimei Island We have nothing but the ocean around here Where do you think all the squids come from? Look at the two reefs over there Don't they look like a horn and a crab? This is the Aimen Beach We do all sorts of water activities here People come here for... Water motorcycle, ATV... And barbecue I can show you if you want to try out Sure What have you heard about me exactly? This crazy young man... He goes on treasure hunts every two months He often stops by Xiamen for supplies People in that area all know about him Crazy indeed Do you know how he got my attention And came all the way here? (Surf board rental, beer) Are you telling me... You know about this as well? I knew there's a story Can you tell me? I need writing materials You don't want this? Excuse me More drinks here, please Anything but Corona Come on, tell me the story! There's nothing much to say What? What is it? Tell me! Since we were kids Dad has been training DongJing and I The way of living with the ocean My dad trained us So we could dive into the ocean Help him look for the lost treasure That belongs to our family Where's the flag? I got the flag! BeiWei, how come you are always 7 seconds late? Yen BeiWei I waited seven seconds and you still can't beat me? You are such a loser Don't make it easy next time, I will beat you Forget it, you are such a lazy butt Wait and see I might be the younger one But when I grow up, I will beat you Give me a hand I am falling Sooner or later, dad will break your leg Then you can only sail the boat for me I'll be your sailor I can't hold any longer - Don't let go - DongJing Dad We are moving to Kaohsiung tomorrow, are you done packing? Not yet Why are you still here then? Get down Let's go to the beach Come sit Tell me the truth Did you purposely let DongJing win again? Why would I let him win and get punished by you? Is that so? Since DongJing's drowning accident last year You've been letting him win DongJing almost died I won't try so hard like him You try to cover your brother on everything You think you have superpowers? He's my brother BeiWei Don't tell Dad about this accident I don't want to get punished Just do me a favor! - No! - Please Brothers would help each other - Hurry - I don't want Tank on? Yes How much air left? Got your flashlight? Yes You need to check these every time you dive - Got it - OK Off you go! Swim further! Dad, you always favor BeiWei What makes you say that? He gets punished all the time, how is that favoring him? Then why can't I set up the buoy? Both of you need to learn how to locate the buoy Bring back your diver Under any kind of circumstances You both need to learn these skills My skills are better than BeiWei He should be guarding the boat You care too much about winning It's not always about winning and losing You will understand when you grow up Dad, I can feel it BeiWei is going to release the buoy Calm down Find peace in your mind Then you will see what you are looking for In the vast ocean BeiWei is over there! DongJing, you idiot! I am over here! Since we're kids DongJing and I We can sense each other's location No matter how far we are apart I could always sense him What took you so long? I was listening to the sound of the ocean You got nothing better to do? What do you know? We're officially 17 now Got any wishes? Let's make them come true I've got one I want that beer with a slice of lemon on top Just like the guys in the movies Slap it into the bottle Then drink it up at once Shit, Dad is home today? With guests? What you said about my father is complete nonsense! Besides... I am his only child Dad Who are those people that just left? DongJing, BeiWei Go pack your stuff, we are moving Move? Where to? - To PengHu - Dad... Who are those people? What do they want from you? They must be... It's none of your business! Go pack your stuff We are leaving here tomorrow morning You're bringing that? This is the first beer we drank I am keeping it as a souvenir You're crazy And then? It's been seven years since then I've gone on 35 sails The coordinates behind our names Became BeiWei 23 DongJing 119 One month after we arrived in Penghu Dad disappeared again after he went out sailing Yen DongJing Hey, you Pass this to DongJing Yen BeiWei Let's shoot some hoops Coming Hi Hi Yen Beiwei, that cocky guy from next class Is he really your twin brother? I haven't had breakfast, I'll take this This looks delicious This one is tuna, and this is bacon What's thisï¼Ÿ Kimchi Try it Hey, where's DongJing? Yen DongJing! Yen DongJing! I only hunt for my own food But BeiWei never knows what's enough So I stopped spearfishing with him I spend most of the time looking for the right fish One that fits my need This is the treasure that the ocean offers me Here, this fish is for you Fish is good for the brain, you need it You only got one fish? Dad told us before This is the true treasure of the ocean It'll enhance your memory Eat more, maybe your grades will improve That's enough I can't even see my rice, cut it out DongJing Speaking of treasures... I am thinking of quitting school Dad sails alone all the time Aren't you worried for him? Since we moved to Penghu He believes he's getting closer to the treasure He's always out on the sea His trips are longer than a month I can't stop worrying for him Until I see him walk through the door Let's both quit school Awesome! How about this We'll tell Dad when he's back Are you with me? If we drop out at the same time Do you think he'll agree? Maybe he'll think you talked me into this He'll break your legs He won't He trained us since we're kids Because he wants us to go treasure hunting with him Am I wrong? I still think I should finish high school first Fine It makes no difference to me You are different, you are the smart one You do well at school How about this After you finish high school Let's sail together, OK? Alright, let's eat There's nothing to worry now Come on Eat more fish BeiWei wants to quit high school? That's stupid. Giving up his life for the treasure That only exists in legends Here you are Are you thinking about go diving alone? Who says I am alone? Yen DongJing! Get off me! Filthy pirate! Why does your brother always copy your style? You look exactly the same from the back Calm down, SiaoCian At least get a different hairstyle! OK Don't be mad What's wrong? Nothing. You'll have to carry me on your back Because you are late Sorry, the teacher kept me I have something for you What is it? I don't know what you like, so... I made this for you You made it yourself? Cool, show me! This... It's what you picked up last time? Yes Any plans this weekend? No, why? Are you asking me out? This gear set will fit you It's so tiny It'll fit you You set it up like this Put your arm through Your gear will end up out looking like this Like a sticky rice dumpling You can start to assemble yours Don't forget this That's it? The regulator is to your right On your right hand side when you put it on The yellow one is the spare one You can put the spare one... Place your regulator in the center Correct Wrap the regulator with your wetsuit OK, listen up We are doing... You guys are coming as well? Yes You can find sea turtles at the harbor There are dozens over there - Dozens? - Yes Lock it up like this I've never seen one there How do you know you won't see one today? He watched too many movies He thinks Titanic is near Penghu or something There are loads of treasure waiting from him to find He's crazy about money Are you sure there are treasures in the ocean? Don't mind them Let's have lunch Your brother has been telling everyone... The two of you are going on a treasure hunt Be honest with me Don't tell me you want to go with BeiWei And look for treasures in the sea Not now, that's our future plan Yen DongJing, are you stupid or just naive? You don't even know what's down there Why follow him like a copycat? What do you mean? The treasure was hidden from 300 years ago How could it not be gold? People from 300 years ago used money certificates The money certificates must be waterproof Yen BeiWei Knock it off! Yen BeiWei! Yen BeiWei! Yen BeiWei! Get out! Don't come to my classroom again! Are you all right? Sorry for that SiaoCian Are you all right? Look at your pirate brother Where are you going? You're going without me? Can you stop coming to my classroom? But I'm your brother Who else can I go to? You beat up my classmates like that They said they would report to the school What? Are they threatening you? No They are my classmates I see them everyday How am I going to face them? Fine, I get it BeiWei Try to keep a low profile here, OK? Fighting at school again! Dropping out of school! Forging my signature! How can a openwater diver be a diving guide? You think you're an expert? Finish up eating and go study You don't like the food? Then don't eat it! Go to your room right now! I told you so You think you are a smart ass Dare to forge Dad's signature Today is really not my day Dad came back while we were on our way out It's your fault You should've covered my back Come on You think I could fool Dad? Everyone here knows that... You quit school and started working as a diving guide Dad would have to be deaf or blind not to find out I know You could at least buy me some time So I can explain to him in person Then he might go easy on me Are you sure? You are so stubborn I am so hungry Did you save some dinner for me? You wish Dad's definitely going to teach you a lesson today I was saving up my dinner for you Then Dad got pissed and threw all the food away Shit, you are so useless! Dad What are you doing here? Did you finish schoolwork? Never do this again Come, let's go to the beach. Dad I want to go sailing with you What did DongJing say? He wants to finish high school first You should let him study What else can he do? You can wait for him I've told you many times You brothers must sail together What about you? You always sail alone I once had a diving partner We went treasure hunting together Later I realized We have different goals If the partners are out of sync The boat will sink Eat - You want some? - I'm good I got it Where's the lobster? What? Weren't you catching lobsters down there? What took you so long? Get ready for pushups Dad I have exams coming up I am going to a study group Go ahead What's so funny? Will you show me around if I visit Tainan? Of course! I'll show you the nice spots The food is great He's your friend? Yes Let's go SiaoCian, call me, we'll talk more - Bye - Bye Who's that? Is he your friend? What time is it now? Do you know how long I've been waiting? I told you I have training with my dad this morning I finished as fast as I could I ran all the way from the beach Don't be mad at me You still want to go treasure hunting with your dad and brother? No, I am not going with them SiaoCian! I've made myself clear If you are still part of the pirate family There's no way we can be together SiaoCian! Stop it! Stop it! Yen BeiWei! Calm down! It's me, your brother! All you do is fight Can't you grow up? He's hitting on your girl! Yen DongJing! Get your pirate brother out of my sight! Since we are classmates If you two go off sailing again I can lend you my boyfriend's yacht Your fishing boat is like trash Watch your mouth! For your own safety! Let's go Let's go home - Watch your back - Just go! Wipe the blood off You idiot Idiot? You are the idiot! I stood up for you! Why can't you control your temper? I can't stand you How about this After we finish military service Then we sail together, are you in? I want to go to college You are going to keep studying? I want to study at the Marine University What's there? After you go to college Don't spend all your time on girls But if you do get a girl Send me a photo I'll let you know if she's worth it Like you know anything about girls What do you know? Wait and see who gets a wife first! Hey! What were you doing in my house? Hey! Yen DongJing! Don't just stand there! What happened? What's going on? Hurry up! What happened? - Are you Yen ShianJun's family? - Yes He lost too much blood, I need your blood type Dad Where is DongJing? Are you both ok? We are fine Dad, who did this to you? Don't worry about it Was it the gangs from Kaohsiung? Did they threaten you to go treasure hunting for them? I said leave it Stay away from those people Dad How come DongJing's bloodtype... Is different from us? Having different blood types can't be brothers? Hello, My name is Yen BeiWei I am 8 years old He is my twin brother, Yen DongJing Twins? Why don't you look the same? Did your parents find your brother in the dumpster? Say that again! You go find a brother from a dumpster! If you can't find one, I'll kick your ass! Go ahead! - Watch it! - Stop it Who do you think you are? I say "Big white sharks" "Close your mouth" Go back to your seats There are two kinds of twins Identical twins and Fraternal twins They are both born from the same womb Aren't you suppose to welcome new classmates? (Blood Test Results) You can't have too much water yet I'll rinse your lips Yen DongJing Yen DongJing Yen DongJing Yen DongJing! Yen DongJing! Since we were kids DongJing and I... Were able to sense each other's location No matter how far we are apart I could always sense him But now, I feel nothing Nothing at all He is just confused He can't find his way back You must stay here Wait for his signal Then reach out to him and bring him back Longitude and Latitude don't work separately You two must sail together You have to wait for him A month later Dad sailed off again But this time, he never came back I know he is out there somewhere If I find the treasure I will find him I see him in my dreams He kept swimming towards his goal I tried calling him But he never looked back After I turned 18 My life is all about waiting Waiting for Dad He can't return on his own So I need to go find him But if I'm gone, what about DongJing? That's why I set up a baozi stand Right outside my house I hope DongJing Will come back one day And he could still recognize our house Smart, right? Not even close What you are doing... You'll never make enough money To go look for you dad in a further location I'll just get on my boat and sail off Why bother so much? I have an idea You could make more money Then sail off to further places To look for your treasure Want to hear me out? Come closer Sounds like a plan Cheers! BeiWei sails out to the sea In search for a hope in his heart What an interesting family I wonder when did Yen ShianJun started treasure hunting? 27 years Dad went treasure hunting with grandpa since he was 16 Until I turn 18, Dad was 43 Total of 27 years You're spying on me? I thought you were sleeping You're writing the story of my father I need to make sure You don't write anything bad about me Don't worry You weren't even mentioned Why? If I become famous You don't want hot bikini chicks following me around? Don't flatter yourself Who's the celebrity here? I am a famous blogger with a million fans Shame None of them has a chance This famous blogger She is all mine Says who? Did I say yes? The Yen family doesn't seem close to each other Their only thing in common is the ocean But the way they treat the ocean differs greatly Yen BeiWei Come find me I promise I will find you Why do you need a month to pack? When my dad told us we're moving DongJing and I spent only one night packing What's wrong? One month is too long for you? Maybe I shouldn't come then I was joking Next time I come, I'll be staying for good There's lots of paperwork I need to get done Cheng Lan I'll keep you posted with everything OK? Let's go Look at you The address you gave me is real, right? If you don't come back I'll go get you myself, I'm not joking Cut it out! BeiWei Come on in I want to introduce you This is your brother's professor from National Taiwan Ocean University Nice to meet you, Professor Likewise DongJing? He came back Why didn't he tell me? You are still fooling around Doing nothing but treasure hunting Hong, you're exaggerating You just wander around all day Alright, take a seat We'll talk later As for the marine litter How they affect the environment Professor Yuan will provide some of his insights We're going to run a coral examination During the process We'll also focus on the marine debris How it coexists with the coral - OK - Record the statistics Where's Dad? Out on the sea When will he be back? How should I know? He's never on time You don't know? He's been gone for 7 years, right? Why didn't you go to the police? Call the police? Where should they start? When are you going to stop lying? You know exactly where he went That's why you didn't go to the police, right? We were picked on because we don't have a mother They even said Dad adopted us We are only his tool to search for treasures Yen DongJing Grow up, would you? You still believe in those crap? I don't know if we are real brothers But one thing I am sure He is not my father! Quit lying to yourself, BeiWei DongJing is just confused He can't find his way back You must stay here Wait for his signal Then reach out to him and bring him back Yen DongJing You think we look different now? BeiWei, nice haircut Handsome, right? Looks more natural now But not so stylish Can't you guys say something nice? Come on In my opinion... I wouldn't say it's stylish Dude, why are you so harsh on me? - Can't let him have it all - Agree It's been such a long time The ocean here has changed so much So many corals are dead People say fish has a memory spam of only 7 seconds Will they know that their home is gone? No They won't They will always remember their home as it was Here are the reef check report for this year and last year Everyone - Here - BeiWei You guys worked so hard yesterday No worries I made braised herring DongJing Your favorite dish BeiWei, we are almost done here Can you put it on the dining table please?

Do these long trips on the sea So he's doing treasure hunting like your dad? Hold on The writer, Cheng Lan Isn't she the one who came from Xiamen last time? Right That girl whom BeiWei is dating She came with the Xiamen Environmental team - DongJing - No wonder There's a "Treasure Hunting" sign outside your brother's house That's what is going on What do you mean? What does it have to do with the article? Don't you know? (Cause of death: Asphyxia) BeiWei is one of the best divers in PengHu His girl wrote this article Mentions the treasure hidden in Penghu When people come here for treasure hunting Who else would they go to? One does marketing on the internet One does treasure hunting business What a perfect team! He met her at his baozi stand I want to sell baozi as well! He didn't find the treasure on his last trip Yet he could no longer sail Deep under the ocean Lies the legend And his greatest regret Dad is long gone Just like the treasure he searched for his entire life Vanished into the grand blue You are finally back That's right I missed you so much I'll get your luggage You even got a sign?

Garbage Mountain? From where we start, it's about... 100 meters Can we make it? Don't worry I'm the one who does most of the work BeiWei has changed since my last visit here He cares more about the marine environment He's also less gloomy I hope his passion would lead to a good result There are so many divers now Doing research without getting distracted Seems impossible Professor Yuan! A big chunk of coral got ripped off! It must be those tourists! Ghost nets are also gone! DongJing, let's go Let's go check how serious it is What's up? Why the angry face? Someone's picking on you again? Yen BeiWei Does money mean so much to you? What are you talking about? You can't find the treasure So you make up stories about it to make money? You know there is treasure under the sea It's not a rumor You took advantage of Dad's story So tourists would come to you Sure You made money The ocean is ruined by you and the reckless tourists Don't you know that? DongJing, Listen... I don't want to hear about your bullshit! Yen DongJing! Yen BeiWei! We grew up in the ocean She's our mother She's our only friend Get into the water! See for yourself See how much damage you have done! Can't you just listen to me? Yen BeiWei! You betrayed the ocean You betrayed my most beautiful memory You don't deserve to be her friend You don't deserve to be my brother! My treasure is not the same as yours From now on We shall part ways Never meet each other again I heard... Some tourists went diving at Blue Bay They tried to pick up the tangled fish nets But damaged the corals by accident Caused a lot of trouble No wonder DongJing was furious Cheng Lan Did we do something wrong? OK Any questions? You can start assembling your equipment Make sure you check the tank pressure, alright? OK You may start Yen DongJing! I've been here for six weeks now I haven't had the chance to meet you My name is Cheng Lan You often sit out here by yourself Staring at the ocean like that's where you ought to be You don't like it full of tourists, right? That article you wrote About the man spending 27 years searching for treasures The story of my father... Did you hear it from BeiWei? He told me everything About your ancestors and your dad's treasure hunts And your story Why did you write it? Why telling the world about the treasure in Penghu? Is it really just for BeiWei to do his business? DongJing You haven't seen BeiWei's website, have you? You should have a look Then you'll understand the treasure he's looking for (Treasure Hunting) (Coral Reef Checking) (Gray whale unusual mortality rate along the west coast of America) (Coral bleaching causes severe impact on marine ecological diversity) Treasure Hunting My brother told me when I was young The treasure is the ocean itself Our father told us Pirates... They know how to get along with the ocean I understand it now Wherever Dad is Longitude and Latitude will always meet What is your treasure? The ocean My treasure is the ocean itself I could see a buoy floating on the surface His partner spots the bright orange color from afar He then brings his partner back DongJing, you idiot, I'm over here! I'm home BeiWei! They found her! They found your father's boat! Are you Cheng Lan? Yes, you found it? Are you BeiWei? Yes, I am Where is the Jing-Wei? Follow me You may not know who I am, but I know your father Since 12 years ago Our fathers did treasure hunting together On their last trip... Only your father came back Your dad was in charge of the boat He left my dad on the sea! What really happened out there Only the two of them know But they left together and only one came back Your father can make up anything What about the boat? Did my dad come back with the boat? No That's why I wanted your father to find her So he can prove He didn't take my father's boat And he didn't abandon his partner I'm not the kind of person who will leave his partner behind! Where is my father then? I've told you hundreds of times He was in charge of the boat The person who sails cannot dive! When I came up, the boat and him were both gone You take care of your father's yacht business now You should know the rules So you are telling me... What happened on the sea Stays on the sea? Since you are the only one who came back How can you prove yourself? What else do you want me to do? What can you prove if you find the boat? It's been too long Even if your dad died in the ocean You still think you can find him? Your dad has gone missing for 7 years Did you stop looking for him? If it wasn't your persistence Setting up a website To look for the Jin-Wei I wouldn't know Yen ShianJun had a son A son ought to pay his father's debts If you refuse to cooperate I can always go to the other son What the hell do you want? Relax If you accomplish the mission I won't need to go to someone else Right? Get your hands off of her! Stay away from us! What are you staring at? Don't do it (Treasure Hunting) What you said about my father is complete nonsense! Did they threaten you to go treasure hunting for them? Leave it Stay away from those people Yen DongJing! Don't just stand there! Who the hell are you? What are you doing at my house? Get the fuck out! Isn't that BeiWei? It is BeiWei Who's that woman next to him? Dressed like that in PengHu Is he taking them for a treasure hunt? His new girl looks loaded How do you know? Did he dump Cheng Lan? Haven't you heard? Cheng Lan's been gone for a while Really? Rumor has it that BeiWei dumped Cheng Lan For this rich chick You didn't hear that? Enough! I sail off with that woman before dawn Just like... When Dad sails off with his partner Yen DongJing! Is BeiWei back yet? How would I know? Have you seen him in the past two days? Why do you want to look for him? Who do you think you are? He hasn't been back Since his last trip? Cheng Lan Wake up Everyone is the same For the sake of money You can betray anyone Just like Yen ShianJun and Yen BeiWei DongJing You believe BeiWei would betray your brotherhood Because he wanted money? Brotherhood? He is not my brother! My father and his blood type are both AB My blood type is O Here's a fact A person who's blood type is AB Could never have a child with blood type O Why is it so important To be genetically related? What's wrong? Don't you remember? I spend more time underwater than on land I've seen it all! Shut up! Yen BeiWei You listen to me carefully I won't allow you to disappear like your father I can't dive I can't save you from underwater Don't worry I won't let you carry the heavy gear all day long And go searching for me underwater BeiWei, I'm no fool If the boat is that easy to find How come they spent ten years without finding it? I am Yen BeiWei There's nothing I can't find in the ocean Don't cry They gave me some coordinates Where is the location? Don't worry I will come back safely I will take you home You might not be biologically related Does it change the connection you've had since kids? Can't you feel the pain he hides in his heart? From now on We shall part ways BeiWei never had a single doubt About you being his brother He values your brotherhood more than his life He's not as smart as you are He doesn't know how to protect himself Where is the location they gave you? The less you know, the better Promise me don't tell DongJing anything (Treasure Hunting) (Garbage Mountain, Blue Bay) It's mine, Dad gave it to me! Stop arguing! The marks in this area I've seen my dad drew them But this part I think it was added by BeiWei He's most likely to be in these areas According to the coordinates It's around Chi Mei I know that area well There is a shipwreck in this area There are large holes on the ship It's quite damaged I think we should try this spot Anything? Find peace in your mind Then you will see what you are looking for In the vast ocean What's wrong? He's here BeiWei is down beneath And we don't have much time Hong! He found him! He's down here What's the depth? I felt it We weren't born brothers But as I dive down into the big blue The moment I saw BeiWei I finally realized We are brothers We share the same blood The blue ocean is our blood Was it Dad's boat? I'm not sure I found a logbook down there Then someone attacked me I think... She found what she was looking for DongJing, are you listening? You must remember the coordinates If one day, I don't return from my trip This coordinates will be your starting point Where shall we start? What's the coordinate Dad added to your name? You never return as promised That's the meaning of farewell A journey of love It's like turning bookpages while smoking Words come scattering out Leaving one number behind My seat number Window seat The destination of this train Is you
