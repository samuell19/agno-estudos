- Tommy, Tomas! Come unlock this gate! What are you doing locking yourself inside your own fence? Well, I'll be dad gum. - What are you doing, Clifford? - Doing fine, Tomas? How are you? - Bueno. We're good. - Is that a fact? - Well, what is a fact nowadays? - Well, I just wanted to come out and check on you. - Check on me? I don't need checking on. - The whole gang's worried about you living out here like some hermit. - I doubt they're worried about me. - Oh, yes, they are. - Hey Clifford, you want a beer? - No, since I graduated from whiskey A&M, I've been holding the line. No more cerveza, doctor's orders. - Well, if you're not here for a free beer what brings you out? - Tommy, I came to check on you. Nobody sees you anymore but I can tell from your ice chest that you've been sneaking into town buying beer and ice. Why don't you ever holler? - I don't know. - What do you do all day? Look at this place? No running water, no electricity. Just you and the great outdoors. What are you doing with a chicken? - Well, Suzanne gave her to me. - Just you and the chicken, huh? - Her name is Blanche. - Well, at least it's not a Canadian goose. Tommy, I've been mowing your yard for months. Your neighbors are complaining I don't edge the sidewalks. You shouldn't be mowing my yard. I'll get some young kid to do that for us. - That's not the point. The point is that you're moping out here like a wounded buffalo, living like a hermit. Nobody sees you anymore. - I'm not moping. - I know, I know. Listen, Tomas, why don't you come over to Suzanne's this afternoon? The whole gang has been asking about you. - I like it out here. This country life fits me just fine. - You and Thoreau, "Live the life you have imagined" "Simplify, simplify." "The world is but a canvas to your imagination." - Your memory just amazes me, Clifford. Do you ever forget anything? - It's my residual pool. It's wide as the Atlantic and only an inch deep. Forgetting has never been a problem. Regretting has. - Yeah, well, you shoulda had regrets in your youth, not now when you're too old to play around. - Just like my friend Jerry Puckett said, "Age has done more for my morals "than all the Sunday schools in the world." - What does Melinda think about your morals? - Well, she thinks they're better. Remarrying Melinda on our anniversary was the best decision I ever made, other than marrying her in the first place. - Well, she's an angel, a God-for-sure angel. Hanging on to you is a testament to her tenacity. - Or to my magnetic personality. - Are you gonna stay for supper? I'll go catch us a catfish. - Catfish? - Yeah, down here in the pond we got catfish. They're easy to catch. One cast, you know, one catfish. Yeah, I feed 'em dog food. - Dog food? I think I'll pass. - You're more than welcome to stay. - I think I'll pass. Listen compadre, I just wanted to remind you of Suzanne's happy hour. Everybody would like to see you. Come on into town and visit some. Of course we wouldn't wanna interrupt your dinner conversations with Blanche. - Well, there's something to be said to have a companion that doesn't talk back. - Tommy, next time you're in town sneaking around buying beer and ice, holler at me. This Thoreau business can get outta hand. You take care, you hear? - I will and you, too. - How are you Suzanne? - Good to see you, Cliff. - Good to see you. - Take a load off your feet. There's water in there, too. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So how's Tommy? - Oh, he's as depressed as ever. - Oh poor Tomas. - He claims that he likes living alone like some modern-day Thoreau. Did you give him a chicken to cheer him up? - I did send my little hen out there that the rooster had been chasing unmercifully. - He's named her Blanche. - Blanche? - He hand feeds her, waits on her hand and foot, treats her like some long lost soul mate. I swear they talk to each other. - What an odd couple. - It's a sad a state of affairs. - Well, she's a real beauty. Maybe she'll make Tommy happy. - Don is saving the planet from marauding coyotes. - Well, that sounds like a chore. - Say, Suzanne, can chickens fly? - Well, Cliff, every evening my Orpingtons fly to the roost. - I was just thinking. - Oh dear, that sounds dangerous. - Clifford J., you gotta be kidding me. - I am not kidding you. This is the airplane that you shoot coyotes out of, isn't it? - You bet it is. This thing'll fly backwards if I can get the wind just right. These coyotes anymore have gotten to where they're so smart that it's the only way I can get 'em. - Well, it's perfect for our project. All you have to do is throw a couple of chickens out the window when you're going real slow. No spins, no barrel rolls, no bombing like you did in Vietnam. Just toss a couple of chickens out. That's all you have to do. - That's the craziest thing I ever heard. - No, it's a bet between Tommy and I to see whose chicken can fly the furthest and it's for Tommy's sake, believe me. - Craziest thing I ever heard. You guys have been making bets like this for over 60 years but I can tell you for sure this one's gonna take the cake. - What's stupid about this bet to see whose chicken can fly the furthest? - You guys have lost all your marbles. Don't you know they say this is exactly how Alzheimer's starts? - And one more little thing that I want you to do. When you're flying up there to a thousand feet, reach behind you and pull some feathers out of Tommy's chicken so it doesn't fly so well. - You gotta be kidding me. - No! You need to do this. I'm serious. It's for Tommy's sake. - Wait a minute. You're telling me for Tommy's sake I'm pulling feathers out of Tommy's chickens' butt, but it's for Tommy's sake? - Well, I've got to win the bet but the whole project is for Tommy's sake. Tommy's won 90% of the bets that we've ever made and this is my chance to double down and catch up. We're betting 100 United States dollars on whose chicken can fly the furthest. - Well, if it's for Tommy, I'll do it. - Well, we're counting on you, Don Juan.

I coulda been in the shower. - Well, I'll come back and see if my luck's any better. - You're impossible! Get in here. How are Melinda and the kiddos? - They're all doing great. Melinda's an angel to put up with me. - It would take an angel! - Do you mind if I smoke? - Of course, I mind if you, put those cancer sticks away. Those things are gonna kill you! I've been telling you that. I thought you quit. - You've been telling me that since I was in the eighth grade. But actually what I came by for was to talk about our friend. - About Tommy. I haven't seen him since Liz's funeral. - That's why I came by. Tommy and I are driving to Marfa tomorrow. Why don't you join us? - Why are you gonna to Marfa? - I told Tommy about the new hotel and he said he wanted to see it. He's not happy about Marfa being a postmodern art mecca for people with skinny jeans. - He's not alone in that. - It'll just bring more weirdos to West Texas. Next thing you know, the people in Marfa will be speaking French. - Donald Judd started it all. Who would've thought that Marfa would turn into a postmodern art mecca. - I've got lines going to my septic tank that are more artistic than Donald Judd's cubes. - You just don't understand his work, Clifford. He's a minimalist. You have to put it into context. - He's no minimalist. He owns half the buildings in Marfa. He has a home in New York City, a home in Germany. He's bought a bunch of ranches in Presidio County. Tommy's the minimalist. He's living out there drinking water out of a horse trough, got one spoon, one fork, one knife, one plate, and a fishing pole. - A fishing pole? - His dirt tank is full of catfish. He feeds 'em dog food and he talks to his chicken. - He talks to a chicken? - Yes, he named the chicken Blanche. Wouldn't surprise me if he turned into a Buddhist monk. - He's just missing Liz. You know this is hard for him. - I know, I know but Tommy's not designed to be a recluse. He needs to be around his friends. That's why you need to come to Marfa with us. - Maybe I will. It's been a long time since the three of us kicked around together, Clifford. - Since high school. - But we did have some fun, didn't we? - Yes, we did. All I ever wanted to do in high school was get into your knickers. Nothing I tried worked. That's why I started smoking. - Don't blame me for your bad habits. - Why didn't you marry me or Tommy instead of that worthless Lester? Here I was a future attorney, a man of the bar. Tommy was a successful rancher. Either one of us would have been better than Lester. - You know I could never choose between you and Tommy and I sure couldn't handle you both. Anyway, Lester's awful good looking. - Well, he's bald as a cue ball now and he's on his fourth wife. You're lucky it didn't last. - Yeah, but I have my beautiful children and my grandbaby Ryan. I have no regrets. - Ah, regrets are my department. I'll pick you up Friday? - Okay, what time? 'Bout 10:30. And don't wear too many clothes. We may play some strip dice. - You always lost but we'll stop the game before we get too embarrassed this time, okay? Remember? - I remember how y'all left me out of high and dry halfway to Marfa in nothing but my boxers and one boot. Hasta lumbago. - Okay. Adios, Clifford. - Hey, you're getting to be a regular around here. - Well, somebody's gotta keep you on the straight and normal. Besides I brought you some presents. - All right, a six pack of beer. I know what to do with that. - Well, since I quit drinking you're the one that's gotta keep the beer distributors in business. - What's this? - Some dog food for your catfish? - That'll keep 'em barking. Chicken scratch? - It's for Blanche. I been thinking about Blanche. - You've been thinking about Blanche? What in the world are you thinking about Blanche for? - I've been thinking about how far Blanche can fly. - Blanche can fly? - Tomas, since we've been betting, you won about 90% of the bets ever since that we bet a quarter on whose chinch bug would uncurl the first. You could retire on the bets you've won from me. - Maybe so. - And I figured out a way to get my money back. I'm gonna bet you $100 that my chicken can outfly your old Blanche. - You don't even have a chicken. - Now, how do you know? I may be the boss of a chicken syndicate. The Flying Leghorns, the Dominating Dominics, the Roaring Rhode Island Reds. - What in the world are you talking about, Clifford? Flying chickens? - Well, it's better than talking chickens where you sit and have conversations with Blanche while y'all eat catfish and dog food. - We don't eat dog food. That's for the fish. - After I left the other day I got to thinking about all the bets that you've won from me over the years and it's just not fair to enrich a good friend like you with my life savings. - Well, I guess I have to ask you. What kinda harebrained idea you got dreamed up this time? - I talked to our old Vietnam vet buddy Don Juan and he'll take our chickens up a thousand feet in his airplane and toss them out and the chicken that flies the furthest wins $100. - Oh Lord. - Thomas, all chickens can fly. Just ask Suzanne. And there's one other thing. - Oh Lord. - I want you to go to Marfa with me tomorrow. - I don't need to go to Marfa. - I didn't say need. You ain't gonna believe what the artists have built, smack dab downtown. - In downtown Marfa? - A new four-story hotel. Looks like a Donald Judd cube with 50,000 acres of free parking in any direction. I'll pick you up at 11 if Blanche can do without you for a few hours. - Clifford, you're 3/4 crazy. - Well a friend in need is a friend indeed. I'll see you manana. - Adios. - Cliff, I said a chicken could fly to the roost. I didn't say you could drop 'em from a thousand feet. - It's not flying, it's gliding. What if I borrow that old self-important rooster of yours. You say he's always pestering your hens. Let's give the girls a little vacation. Okay, okay, I wasn't gonna do this but I'll cut you in for 15% of the winnings as the rooster's agent. What do you think about that? - Clifford, seems like I've got $200 invested in these chickens and you're offering me $15. - Well, it's not for me. It's for Tommy. Trust me on this. - If it'll help Tommy out of his funk, I'm all in for it. But if anything happens to my roosters or my chickens I hold you personally responsible. - Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. - Good. - Where's Tommy? - Hop in. We're gonna pick him up at his ranch. - Good to see that old boy. - Hey, Carolyn. - Tom. - Been a long time. I didn't know you were coming. - You didn't? - Tommy, Carolyn said she wanted to see the hotel, too. - Well, that'll be okay with me. - Say, do you mind driving? My gimpy knee's acting up on me. - Well, I can do that. Let's go. - Remember when you guys brought me duck hunting out here that time and crawled on our belly and on the count of three you stood up and shot enough ducks for Thanksgiving dinner? - Yeah, and we cut high card to see who had to go get the dead ducks and I near caught pneumonia. - Well, if you woulda died that woulda saved us a lotta trouble. - Oh. - Tom! - It's the truth! - Yes. Yeah. Remember all the dreams we had and the crazy things we did, driving around getting in trouble? - We're not too old to get in trouble. What'd you have in mind? - I remember having the biggest crush on both of you. - Yeah, Clifford and I used to have a bet to see who was gonna marry you. We both lost that one. - That's true. - The truth is I loved you both and I still do. Being around you both makes me so happy, you and your crazy bets. Remember the time we were out here dove hunting and you had to bet on whose feather was gonna hit the ground last and I had to be the referee? - And I won that one. - And the time you two bet on who would win a bicycle race and Clifford showed up with the lawnmower motor rigged to his back tire. - Well, I can still remember him hittin' that pothole. I could see it now. - He flew over handlebars 30 miles an hour. How he ever landed on his feet is a miracle. - It took me a quarter mile to slow down. My first ride musta been 30 yards long. - He still never did reach the finish line. I won that one, too. - You did. - And Carolyn, you won't believe what Clifford dreamed up this time. You wanna tell her? - I've been thinking about all the money I've lost to Tommy a dollar at a time and it's been weighing on my mind. - Uh oh, here we go again. Clifford, will you ever stop betting? - Life is just a bet. You should never take yourself or life too seriously 'cause you're not gonna get out of it alive anyway. - Sometimes the road can get a little rocky. - "Sweet are the uses of adversity." So we've all had a few bumps in the road. - Some more than others. - I'll never bet on the number of bumps. - No. - Amen. Do you know what Clifford bet me now? Yeah, Clifford you tell her. - Tommy bet me that his Blanche could outfly my Red Baron. - I haven't made you a bet. - What in the world are you two talking about? - Tomas, tell Carolyn about your new girlfriend Blanche. He's fallen in love with Blanche. They live alone in the great outdoors there to enjoy the simple life and the grandeurs of nature. - Tommy is Blanche your chicken? Clifford told me Suzanne gave you a chicken. - Tommy and Blanche eat together, they talk together. Now, Blanche is a good-looking chicken and I think the relationship's platonic. - Oh Clifford, what's the bet? What have you dreamed up this time? - $100 for whose chicken can glide the furthest. Winner take all. - What? - Don is gonna take Tommy's Blanche and my Red Baron up in an airplane and drop 'em out at a thousand feet. Whichever one glides the furthest wins $100. - Clifford, you're not gonna throw chickens out of an airplane! That's cruel! - We're not throwing babies out of an airplane. - You better not be throwing chickens either. - Carolyn, you amaze me. Chickens have wings, don't they? - I'm serious. - Well, I haven't made the bet anyway. - You know you will. You can never resist him. - And I can tell you this and I haven't made any bets but Blanche can outfly any rooster that old Clifford can scrounge up. - That'll be the day. - You guys are impossible.

Remember when they filmed "Giant"? Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor stayed here. Remember the scene where Rock Hudson took his daughter-in-law into the diner and the guy refused to serve them because she was Hispanic? Do you remember that scene? Rock Hudson lost the fight but he won my heart. - Yeah, I remember that scene. - Chill Wills was my hero. His only job was to get drunk with Rock or to get drunk by himself if Rock wasn't thirsty. - Drunks are not heroes. - James Dean was kind of a hero till he lost the road race from the movie set into Marfa. Aunt June Elkins was driving a Plymouth station wagon that Bunk Pfiester had souped up. - Tommy, didn't you date Socorro in high school? - Yeah, for a little while. Her folks and my folks they didn't think it was a very good idea. You weren't supposed to cross those divides back then. - She was beautiful and I was so jealous. - You were? - Yeah. Remember when she came down with that awful case of measles? - Yeah, I kinda do. Yes, I think she missed school for a couple weeks and almost went to hospital. - You guys love me so much. That was me. I'm the one that came down with the awful case of the measles and was outta school for two weeks. - "Doubt thou that stars are fire. "Doubt that the sun doth move in the sky. "Doubt that truth be a liar "but never doubt that we love you." - Clifford. - We love ya. - Yeah, I love you guys. - Let's eat. Keep your wallet in your pocket. It's my treat. - How big a T-bone they have here? - They don't. - Uncle Tommy, why don't you let me bring you some clean clothes? - Why, Miss Maddy, it's sure good to see you. What brings you out here? - Don't you get lonely out here? - Well, lately I've been getting a whole lotta company but it sure is good to see you, Maddy. - One reason I came out here was to ask you about this bet you made with Clifford. - A bet with Clifford? I haven't made any bet. - About dropping chickens out of an airplane at 10,000 feet? - Now, where did you hear that? - Look, it's all over Instagram. - What's Instagram? - It's all over Facebook, too. - What what are you talking about? - I think you should probably call it off. - I hadn't made any bet with Clifford. And if I wanna throw a chicken out of an airplane or have one for supper, that's my business. - Uncle Tommy. - Hi, Tommy. How you doing? - Hello, Theresa. - Good to see you. - Yep, good to see you, too, Theresa. - Can I get you something? - Sure, I'll take a cold one there, please. - Put that back in your pocket. This is on me. - Well, I thank you-- - No, you don't need to do that. - Oh, oh well. You gotta keep the doors open. Yeah, yeah I was just passing by. - I'm so glad you stopped. - Yeah, things been a little tough lately. - You're missing Liz, aren't you? - Yeah, she's one to be missed. What did you do? - I joined the Catholic church. You should talk to Father Rick. - Father Rick? But he's not a priest anymore. And he comes in here? - He comes in here every Thursday night. Didn't you know? - No, I didn't know that. - His band draws quite a crowd. - Hello, Tommy. - Hey. - How are you these days? I'm doing good, Father. - Hey, it's just Rick. The whole town is talking about your bet. - Oh, this is crazy. I hadn't even made a bet and I got half of Brewster County mad at me already. - People are people. I play music to celebrate the joy in life and some in the church are saying it's unbecoming of a priest. - That's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it? - Now. None of us knows the Lord's plan. Missing Liz? - Yeah, yeah things are tough. - Try prayer, Tommy. - Prayer? - Works for me. - For me, too. - But you're no longer in the church, Father. - I'm still doing the Lord's work only not in church. You should come hear our band. Our new vocalist is terrific. - Yeah, Theresa told me. - Why don't you come tonight? Dancing brings people together and puts joy in our heart. - I'm might, well, I just might do that. - Try prayer, Tommy, and come listen to our music. Both can work miracles. And don't let anybody get you down about your bet. I think it's a fun bet. People are people. Besides chickens can fly. - Amen. Thanks for the beer, Theresa. - You're welcome, Tommy. Come back anytime. - Will do. - Everything's gonna be all right. - All right, thank you. - Hey Eddie, I heard you were in West Texas. - Hey, Suzita. Good to see you. I bought a house in Marfa last month. Been gone from West Texas 50 years but I just can't get West Texas outta my soul. - Are you still practicing law? - I'm still representing the maimed and the forgotten. Slowing down a little, trying to smell the roses. How are you doing? - You went off to LA, Eddie, to seek your fortune. I stayed right here and found mine. - I'm glad things have been good for you. LA's has been good for me. But I miss West Texas. Say, does Tommy stop by here very often? - He used to, Eddie, but he doesn't come by much anymore since he lost Liz. - Well a group in Marfa asked me to represent them. They heard about Tommy's bet. - Why are they talking to you about Clifford and Tommy's bet? - I told them it was probably just a rumor but that's why I wanted to talk to Tommy. - He hadn't been here in a while, Eddie, but Clifford still sees him. You want me to tell Clifford to tell Tommy to get in touch with you? - Yeah, would you mind? And please tell him an animal rights group has talked to me about the bet. - You gotta be joking. - If it's just a rumor, they don't have anything to worry about but if those guys are throwing chickens out of the airplane, somebody's gotta tell 'em this is not high school. And this is not the West Texas we grew up in. - It's the same West Texas I grew up in, Eddie. Maybe you're the one who's changed. - It's the times that have changed, Suzanne. Time marches on. - Hello, Jim, take a load off. - You bet. Don't mind if I do. - What in the world brings you out here? Been a while. You out hunting banditos? - No, Tommy. You're looking good. You're taking good care of yourself. - Well, you, too. Looks like they've been feeding you well. - Well, I hate to miss a meal, you know. Feller might blow away and, by George, drink a little cerveza, too. - Well, let me offer you one. - You bet. Old Matt Dillon had one every now and then. - There you go. We'll open one. - Thank you. - Here's to ya. - Thank you. - Jim, what's on your mind? This can't just be a social visit. - Well Tommy, I heard about a bet 'tween you and Clifford. Is it true? - Well, we might, we might not. What's it to you? - Well, Tommy, an animal rights group has filed an injunction against y'all's bet. - Animal rights in West Texas? Filed an injunction? - Well, I figured you'd say that, Tommy, and all you gotta do is tell me there's not any bet and it'll be over with. - Well, you could tell your animal rights friends to take that piece of paper and just tell 'em what they could do with it. - Well, I know, Tommy. People are funny these days, you know. Heck, they're treating their pets a lot better than they do their neighbors and even youngins are becoming vegetarians nowadays. - If this don't beat all. An injunction from a bunch of animal rights activists. What's West Texas coming to? - Judge said deliver it and I'm just the messenger. I suggest that you show up. - This beats all I ever heard. - Well, Tommy, it's got the court date on there and I suggest you show up and you'd be wise to bring a lawyer with you, too. - A lawyer? If I wanna throw a cow out the airplane, I mean, that's my God-given constitutional right. - Tommy, I agree with you, I agree with you. But, once again, I suggest you show up, present your case. - If that don't beat all. - We love our chickens. Come on, don't do it. - Yeah, those people are crazy. - Put down those signs and take off those hats! I said put down those signs and take off those hats! This is a court of law. - Yeah. - All rise for the Honorable Billy Ray Stubblefield. - Thank you very much. You may be be seated. Welcome to the courtroom this afternoon. We have an item on the docket which is an application for a temporary injunction. Previously a TRO was denied by the court but we did set this day for the hearing. And the case is styled Blanche and Red Baron, two living Gallus domesticus by and through their guardians ad litem and friends of the court. They are the petitioners. The respondents are Tommy Mangrem and Clifford Hardwick. Can we have announcements? - Your Honor, Edward Pfiester appearing pro hac vice for the applicant People for Our Feathered Friends or PFOFF, pronounced Puff Off. We are seeking a temporary injunction to prevent the cruel injury and very untimely death of two of God's creatures, the named Blanche and the named Red Baron. Counsel and I have met and conferred at length but to no avail. - Order in the court. I understand that there's a lot of emotion involved in this case, but I've got to have decorum and dignity and just to remind you we have a little holding cell behind me. It's about 10 feet square. It's not air conditioned, doesn't have any furniture, and it's not pleasant, but it is available for use. Ms. Rogers. - Thank you, your Honor, Liz Rogers from Alpine. I'm appearing on behalf of the respondents Tommy Mangrem and Clifford Hardwick also both lifelong residents of Alpine, Texas. - Are both parties ready to proceed? Mr. Pfiester. - Yes, Your Honor. - Ms. Rogers? - We are, Your Honor. - If there are no preliminary matters, I'll proceed to hear opening statement. Mr. Pfiester, as the petitioner you may proceed. - Your Honor, a combination amounting to a civil conspiracy is afoot here. The purpose of the conspiracy is to profit from wagering upon the fate of these two poor chickens. Upon the fate of two chickens? - Yes, Your Honor. The respondents' plan is to drop these two chickens from an airplane flying at least a thousand feet above the ground. It will surely cause the death of these innocent creatures. We will present irrefutable evidence that this will cause the untimely death of both chickens. - Your Honor, for the respondents, everybody in this community knows my clients well because they've lived here their whole life. They are upstanding citizens of Brewster County and the Big Bend region. They are both stalwart supporters of the Alpine Fighting Bucks. They both maintain a modicum of sobriety. And, in fact, Mr. Hardwick has recently converted to the ranks of the abstemious. - Ms. Rogers, what is your response to these allegations? - My clients are not members of some shadow conspiracy to make a profit from the suffering of these two noble birds. And, in fact, I want to emphasize the word birds. - I would call them chickens. - Through the testimony of Al Kauffman, the Director of the Alpine Future Farmers of America, we intend to show that these noble birds will not suffer injury or death from the proposed demonstration of flying skills that are proposed by my clients. Nor will they be traumatized by an exercise which is natural to their species. - Your Honor, we will call El Paso native, Miss Jody Richardson. She's an aeronautical engineer and a practicing lawyer in Austin, Texas. - I've read her curriculum vitae, Your Honor, and I have no objections to Miss Richardson's testimony as an expert. - Miss Richardson, have you had an opportunity to examine both the chickens in question? - I have. - Could you outline for His Honor the steps you've taken by way of research, testing if any, et cetera, in reaching the conclusions you've reached in this case? - Yes. Just like in most of the cases that I work on, I created a custom wind tunnel to simulate the air pressure as the object falls through space. Then I applied the equation that has been in place since the 1700s to determine the relationship of the density of the object, the air pressure, and the velocity at which they are moving. - Miss Richardson, based on everything you've testified to do, everything you've done in this case so far, assuming these two chickens were taken up in an airplane and dropped at an altitude of over a thousand feet, in your professional engineering opinion, what would happen to them? - Chickens are meant to be walking on the ground. You can tell that by looking at their feet. They do not have claws, they do not perch. The Bernoulli's equation tells us that the chickens weigh too much and do not fly. The longest flight known of a chicken is 13 seconds. And they will fall to the Earth and make a four-foot splat. - Oh! - No, no! - Your Honor, the respondents would call Mr. Al Kauffman, who, like me, is a graduate of Texas A&M University, as an expert in avian aerodynamics. He knows his chickens. - I object to these outbursts, Your Honor! They're very, very prejudicial to my client. - Mr. Pfiester, this is the Aggie war whoop and in Texas it is honored by time and tradition and we will permit it. - Mr. Kauffman, in your esteemed estimation, if the two said birds were dropped from an airplane at an altitude of a thousand feet, would they simply spread their wings and fly back to Earth? - To be exact they would glide back to Earth. You see, Your Honor, these are not cage-raised birds. These are free-range chickens, which makes a huge difference in their ability to glide. Have you noticed they both have wings? - Are you suggesting, Mr. Kauffman, that a free-range chicken could be thrown from an airplane at a thousand feet and make it back to Earth safely? - I am. It is their instinctive ability that defines their aeronautical abilities. Could a bird fly up a thousand feet? No, not at all. But gliding back down a thousand feet? That's a bird of a different feather. - And, Mr. Kauffman, what would be the outcome of such a glide? - Both birds, both foul, would return to Earth completely unharmed. Just the way it is. Yeah. - Howdy. - So anyway, I will direct my-- - Good to see you, Judge. How are you doing? - Fine, Clifford? How are you doing? Do you have a drink around here? - Sure do. - Something stronger than beer? - Yeah, we do. Judge, sure was glad that you saw it our way today. - Well, Clifford, I'm sorry I can't talk to you about the case. But I reckon I could drink some of your whiskey. - Clifford, would you mind getting us a couple of bourbons? - Heavens no, Judge Ferguson. I'd like to propose a toast. - Here, here. - To west Texas where justice rules and chickens fly! - Yeah! - Y'all got the whole dang town riled up about this bet. - It did kinda get outta hand, didn't it? - You know, Clifford, I fought in Vietnam for everybody's right to protest but right now we got a bunch of left-wing hipsters out protesting a bet about throwing a couple of chickens out of an airplane. What in the heck has happened to America? - Well, America hasn't changed any. It's just now we slug it out with lawyers instead of guns. - Are y'all really gonna go through with the bet? - Yes, we won the lawsuit, but we had one slight change. We have moved it to the Newberry which will give you a little bit more room. - And won't attract quite so much attention, I hope. Now, when is this harebrained function gonna take place? - At two o'clock tomorrow afternoon I'll bring you the chickens and Sam will show up to help you drop 'em out. Now, another little slight change. Don't pull any feathers out of Tommy's chicken. I've become quite attached to little Blanche. - So this thing is really gonna happen? - It is indeed. You have your jet fired up and ready to go. - And I thought you were kidding me. - Not a whit. - Look, they're coming in low from the south! - Drop! - Look, they dropped 'em! - Look at those chickens! - The rooster's falling! - Flap your wings, Red Baron! He's flying like a sack of cement. - Wanna go double or nothing? - It's too late for double or nothing. Look at that Blanche! She's gliding better than a buzzard. You been training that chicken? - Well... - See, I told you chickens could fly. Why'd you ever doubt me? - 60 years worth of experience, that's all. I'm just glad those chickens made it or you'd be mincemeat. - Oh ye of little faith. Tommy's buying! - I guess this is mine. - Yes. - Won't you ever learn, Clifford? - I've been thinking about a match race. You still have that land turtle you call Speedo? - Hey, Rick. - Hey. - Wanna play a little song for me? - You got it. - Alrighty. - Alright, that's a good one. - Hey, young lady, would you like to dance? - Tommy, I would love to. - Alighty. ♪ I am weak ♪ ♪ But thou art strong ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ - Old Clifford, he's something else, isn't he? - He really is.
