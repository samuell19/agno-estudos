ARABIAN NIGHTS “Truth lies not in one dream, but many.” - The Arab/an Nights Who'll open bidding for this slave, the Lady of the Moons? No woman here gives better massages. Her scalp massages will make you sleep like a baby. Her leg massages will make you skip like a deer. As the poet says: “A masseuse is worth more than all wise men. In her hands she holds the heads of kings.” - Five hundred dinars. - Six hundred. Seven hundred. Hear that, Lady of the Moons? Seven hundred dinars! Will you have him as your master? I certainly do not want that monkey-beard! I'll take her. Eight hundred! You can't be any good if God only gave you one eye. How dare you, you rude girl! Cursed vendor, what have you brought to this market? You're right, but it's not my doing. Her master has allowed her to choose her buyer. One thousand! A kingly sum! What are you waiting for? Will you take this old man as your master, Zumurrud? You have a soft candle in your pants. It rises when you sleep, and sleeps when you rise. God pity whoever lies with you! Auctioneer... how dare you bring a slave here who ridicules us so brazenly with her stupid and irreverent remarks! I beg your forgiveness. I'll be sold to no one but that boy there. Me? That pip-squeak doesn't have a dinar! - Are you sure? - He alone will be my master. His cheeks are smooth, and his beauty enchants the eye. Step forward, young man, and buy this slave, for she's chosen you. Come forward. What are you waiting for? Come. Lead me by the hand to the next alley. Take this money. - Then what? - Give the seller a thousand dinars, then rent a house in the carpenters' district. Not there, silly. Not like that. I don't know how. You have to help me. Stop gambling, Barsum, and come here. Come, I say! Quick! Nur ed Din, wake up. Come here. What is it, my love? Did you stay up all night making that? Look. Run to the market and sell this cloth for 200 dinars. But listen very carefully. Don't sell it to a blue-eyed man. Not at any price. Understand? I fear that something is going to part us. I feel feverish, like there's a shadow over my heart. Don't worry. I'm here. Look, sir. Isn't this beautiful? Clearly made by expert hands. Who made that? My slave girl embroiders for me. I'll buy her. Could I sell the soul from my body? I'm jesting. Please take it for 200 dinars. I'll pay 1,000. No, I was forbidden to sell it to a blue-eyed man. It's a handsome offer. You're a fool if you don't take it, my boy. Very well, but stay away from me. Christian, why do you follow me? I ask only for something to eat. My belly's empty. I have nothing. Go with God. Who won't feed a guest is an ingrate in God's eyes. What is it? What are you reading? Listen... My eyes saw her, to my great misfortune. What agony it was to leave her there. Poets of my court... let's see if it's true that poets can speak even of what they haven't seen. Compose a poem beginning with these words: “My eyes saw her, to my great misfortune. What agony it was to leave her there.” Sium. “My eyes saw her, to my great misfortune. What agony it was to leave her there, that gazelle who captured my heart 'neath the shade of two palms. Over her body she poured water from a silver vase. She saw me and hid her love mound, but it peered out from between her fingers. Ah, to lie with her for an hour or two!” "I said to two youths, '/ love you.' Have you any money?' they replied. ' Yes, ' I answered 'and I spend it generously. ' which those fine lads exclaimed. It's a deal. Look there! Who ere those three boys ? You boys! May I read some verses to you? I wrote them long ago, when I was almost as young as you. “A man hoary with age, but with youthful desires, loves handsome young men and delights in distraction. He arises in the morning in the spirit of Mosul - oh, city of purity - but dreams all day of the sinful life of Aleppo.” And now I'd like to propose something. - We're listening. - Tell us. Come to my house, where we always enjoy nice things: fine wine brought by the brothers of the monastery... lamb, and all manner of fowl. Let us eat and drink, and then you'll take pleasure with each other, and, if you wish, all three will pleasure me. All right. Come. "The greatest joy is that of a young reveler with handsome boys for company. One sings for him, one drinks to his health, and the other offers his mouth to be kissed.” Sium, compose a poem about each of us. “L would give my life for the tenderness of this cheek, for it's worth more than any sum.” “Blessed be he who created these smooth hairless cheeks and gave this skin such a beautiful hue.” “While my soul remains in this tranquil village, my heart is torn between two desires: one, for the minaret of Baghdad, the other for the land of the two mosques.” - What is your name? - Berhane. - How old are you? - Fifteen. - Are you married? - No, and I plan never to marry. Why? Have women hurt you? No, but books say they're treacherous. “Heaven on earth is to be found at their breasts, and the moon shines above their mound of love.” That too is written in books, my boy. But it's in their nature to betray men, whether near or far. They paint their eyes and nails and braid their hair and cause you nothing but woe. I have a proposition: Will you come to my palace? Certainly, my lord. Thank you. - What is your name? - Giana. - How old are you? - Fifteen. - Would you like to come with me? - Gladly. Come, let's go. You'll lose your bet, Zeudi. Your girl is a pot of piss compared to my branch of myrrh. No point arguing which is fairest. We've lulled them to sleep with different potions so they'll wake at different hours, have we not? They'll judge for themselves. You and I will never agree. She's far fairer than him. Just look at her. I believe you're mistaken. He is the fairest. Love will decide. We'll wake them, and the one who falls in love with the other is the less beautiful, for the plain always fall in love with the beautiful. Very well. We'll let love decide. What God wills, happens. What he doesn't, doesn't. Neither of us won. Each has fallen for the other in equal measure. Each is the mirror of the other. Two full moons in the same sky. - How did you get in? - Gate or courtyard - it's all the same. You recognize me, Zumurrud? You dared say my member never grew firm. Now you'll receive your just punishment. God will punish you for this! Nur ed Din! Zumurrud! Blood of my blood! Zumurrud! Zumurrud, where are you? Where are you? What's your name, handsome lad, and why are you crying? What's happened? I've lost my slave. I paid a thousand dinars for her. A blue-eyed Christian stole her from my house. I'll die without her! Don't cry. I'll find your Zumurrud, even if I must search every house in the guise of a holy woman. Thank you. Nur ed Din! I have good news for you! Cheer up! Nur ed Din, I found your slave. In Rashid's house, just as I thought. I managed to speak to her. She'll wait for you tonight by the garden wall. She'll whistle, you'll help her down, and off you'll go together. I helped you, so now you must be nice to me and show me you're a man. My love... You're making it stand up! I should hope so! My love... Nur ed Din! Grab this rope. Help me, my love. My love, take this bag. it's full of gold. Oh, God! Who are you? Where are you taking me? I am me, and I'll take you where I like. Who are you? Nur ed Din's hair is silky, but you feel like a pig! Let me go! Let me go, you ugly beast. Hold your tongue or I'll strangle you. Now walk. Walk! We killed that soldier over there. That will be your fate tomorrow if you don't shut up. I am Giawan the Kurd, if you must know. We're a group of 40 thieves, and we'll all screw you tonight. I've brought you something precious, Father. Guard her well. I'll be back with the others soon. I bet your head is full of lice. Shall I pick them out for you? Shall I? Zumurrud, my love! That's right. Sleep, baby, sleep. Go beddy-bye. Horseman from the desert, you are to be crowned king of this city. - What? - What is your name? I'm a soldier. My name is Wardan. When our king dies and leaves no heirs, we wait for the first man to arrive from the desert and make him king. Praised be the Lord for sending us a man lean of figure and fair of face. Drink now, and let us enter the city. Before being crowned, you must have a wife. You will marry my daughter. Who said I wished to marry? It is our custom. Refuse and you'll be thrown from a tower. Then God's will be done. Do you have nothing to do tonight but pray? Don't you like your bride? You're beautiful, Hayat, but I am unhappy. Do you love another woman? If you don't consummate our marriage, you'll be thrown from a tower. - May I ask you something? If I tell you a secret, will you keep it? I promise. Then look. My God! Now you know my secret. If you betray me, I'll be thrown from the highest tower. - I'll not betray you, Wardan. - My name is Zumurrud. I was the handsome Nur ed Din's slave, but I've lost all trace of him. I'll help you. Luck has frowned on me, but I'll not betray you. If we can draw multitudes to this city, we might find him. But you must pretend to be my wife and tell no one. I promise. We'll bring all the people here you want. Stranger, eat from your own plate. Leave him alone. The king said to eat our fill. But not from other people's plates. I'll eat what I like. Fine! Eat what you like! I hope you choke! I told him not to grab from other people's plates. If the king has him whipped, he deserves it. What is your name, and why have you come here? My name is Ali. I'm a weaver, and I've come to trade. Raise your head and look me in the eyes, stranger. You'd lie to a king, you dog? Are you not Barsum, the Christian who kidnapped a girl? You're right, King. I am Barsum. Take this blue-eyed man outside the city and put him to death. Excuse me. Do you know where I might find my slave Zumurrud? Children, have you seen Zumurrud pass this way? Who is this Zumurrud? Come with us. Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. We'll just give you a nice massage. Be good and lie down. - My love. - Stop, you're making it stand up. Of course, handsome boy. You're trying to take all his goodness. Don't I get a share? No, I made it stand up, and as my mother used to say, “Who brings barren earth to life enjoys its fruits.” That may be, but my mother used to say, “Wild game belongs to whoever takes it, not whoever finds it.” You found it, but I'm taking it. Let's do this. Since you two can't agree, I'll enjoy all of this. Hands off, brother! I'll eat what I like. That rice is cursed. Eat it and you'll be crucified. It already happened once. Hold your tongue, you bastard. I'll do as I like. He'll even eat the plate! Let him be. His face is that of one who's dead already. Besides, you can't fight the will of God. Beggar, are you strong enough to be my porter? I'll pay you well. Give me some apples from Syria, Ottoman quince, peaches from Amman, jasmine from Aleppo, cucumbers from the Nile, lemons from Egypt, currants, myrtle, chamomile, pomegranates, and white roses. I'd also like some pastries, nutmeg ring cakes, soft nougat, puff pastry, sugar, incense, amber, musk, and candle wax. Mabuba! Budur! Sisters, come down. Everything's ready. “Taj al-Muluk, son of King Suleiman, grew into such a handsome young man that everyone who saw him was enchanted Poems were written praising him, and even the purest souls grew shameless for his love, so resplendent was his beauty. As the poet said, 'I embraced him and grew drunk from his scent, swaying like a windswept branch. I grew drunk without drinking, intoxicated on the liquor of his saliva.”' “Dismounting from his horse, Taj spied a gentle and handsome young man dressed in black. But the youth's beauty seemed faded, and he appeared dejected, like one separated from his loved ones.” What's that paper? Nothing of any use to you. Show me. Glory to God, who teaches a man what he didn't know. Why did you begin to cry when you saw this? Mine is a very long story. The events linking me to that scroll and to her that made it are very strange. Tell me your story, and of her who drew these gazelles. My name is Aziz, and I was engaged to my cousin Aziza. On the day of the wedding, when everything was ready, I went to have my bath. All the best, Aziz. Best wishes to you and Aziza. Good-bye, Aziz. Come back to see us one day. You smell so good, Aziz! Aziza, my bride. Ah, I just remembered: I forgot to invite my best friend, Ali. I'll be right back. What are you doing? Aziza's waiting. You sat on your kerchief. Now you can't wipe your brow with it. “The sun and moon marvel when he appears, and rosebuds blush in shame to see his curls.” Now you return ? All were here: the qadi, guards, emirs, merchants. They ate and drank, but you didn't appear, and they left. Your father has postponed the wedding for a year. What happened to you? I've fallen in love with a girl who threw her kerchief to me from a window and then disappeared. Didn't she say anything? She just did this. What could she have meant? Putting her finger in her mouth means you've become to her what the soul is to the body. Two fingers between her breasts means “Return in two days to ease my heart.” Two days? Aziz. My God, how awful you look! You haven't eaten, drunk, or slept. Get up, put on fine garments, and be happy. The two days have passed. Hurry and get dressed. Go to her. May God give wings to your love. Well, Aziz? Why didn't you spend the night with your beloved and taken the pleasure you wanted from her? I wasn't mocking you. Tell me what happened. No, she didn't appear! Aziz, don't be sad. You're about to get what you desire. She was testing the sincerity of your love. You need only return tomorrow night and sit beneath her window. Your troubles are over. And now eat or you might die. Love drives a man insane! He can't eat or sleep! I know. These are the signs of love. - How did it go this time? - She did this. What does it mean? “Wait until sunset. When darkness falls, come. Go to the garden at the far end of the city. Keep going until you find a lamp. Sit and wait for me there. My love is almost killing me.” it's not night yet. Rest a while. You haven't eaten in a week. How did it go? I did everything just as you said, only I dozed off. When I awoke, I found these on my stomach. The coin is her right eye, the eye one swears by. The dagger means she has sworn to kill you if you behave like that again. Then what must I do? Return to her garden tonight. But so you don't doze off again, you must eat and rest now. Lie down and sleep. I am to die. Wake up, Aziz, and eat. I'm not hungry. Come now, eat. Don't act like a child. This time be sure not to eat or doze off in the garden. She will come around dawn. But I want to give you some advice. When you leave her, after you've done what you want with her, recite these lines: In the name of God what should a young man do when love becomes his master?” No, I mustn't touch anything! Aziz, my love, you waited for me. Did you remember to recite those lines? Oh, I forgot! I was looking at this parchment she gave me. Isn't it beautiful? May I have it? Certainly, if you like it. After making love with her tomorrow, promise to recite those lines before you leave her. I promise. Now let me sleep. I'm so sleepy... - Farewell. - Listen. “In the name of God, what should a young man do when love becomes his master?” He must handle it skillfully, hide his secret, and be patient and resigned in all things. Where's Aziza? Alone on the terrace, crying. Why? How can you leave her like this, without a thought to her suffering? Aziz, did you recite those lines? Yes, and she answered with these: “He who loves must hide his secret and be resigned to it.” “He has tried to resign himself but finds within only a heart made desperate by passion.” When you leave her tomorrow morning, recite those lines to her. All right? “He has tried to resign himself, but finds within only a head made desperate by passion, my love.” If he cannot be resigned, perhaps death is the best answer.” Here. Did you recite my lines to her? Yes, and she replied, “If he cannot be resigned, perhaps death is the best answer.” “We have heard and obeyed, so now we die. Say farewell to her who has hindered my love.” Listen: “We have heard and obeyed, so now we die. Say farewell to her who has hindered my love.” My God! The girl who told you those lines is dead. If I'd known about her, I wouldn't have drawn you to me. But she's my cousin! - Did she know we were making love? - Yes. May God make you weep for your youth as you've made her weep for hers. Go now and see her. How long will this ceremony go on? We shall pray deep into the night, as should you, who bear her death on your conscience. What did you do to break her heart? She told me nothing. Tell me. I didn't do anything. Before she died, she said you should tell that other girl: “Fidelity is good, but so is frivolity.” I'll tell her. She left me something to give you, but only when you sincerely mourn her death. Show me. I don't see you sincerely weeping and moaning over her death. I have to go now. I can't wait any longer. My love! You were right: She's dead. We buried her today. You are to blame. Beware lest you be made to pay. She left word that I should tell you this: “Fidelity is good, but so is frivolity.” With these words she's saved you, for I'd decided to harm you. Harm me? How? Tonight, before making love to me, distribute alms for her soul and have a tomb built for her of marble, as they do for a saint. I shall do as you ask. Go. Wait, Aziz. A bit more perfume. Wait, Aziz. A bit more perfume. Have another glass of this chilled wine. To your health! Young man... read me this letter from my son, who works far away. Let me have it. “Dear Father, I am well, but I can't earn a single dinar here. But God's will be done. I send my love. Your son, Ali.” Thank you. Now come into my house for some wine. It's right here. - Ah, very nice! Would you prefer to die or to live? - Live! - Then marry me. Marry you? Only then will you be safe from crazy Budur. Who's crazy Budur? You've lived a year with her and don't know who she is? Ah, the men she's killed before you! Aziza kept you safe up until now, but where will you find another like her? You're an innocent babe when it comes to women's perversity, are you not? It's true. I want to save you, but not like your cousin, without compensation. I'm rich. Nothing's lacking in my house. “No lack of bread in the pantry or water in the pitcher.” You need only do for me what the rooster does for the hen. - And what's that? Come closer. You can't get away anyway. Do as you like with me. I am your slave. Give it all to me, for my life is yours. Aziz... it's been a year, and we've each kept our promise. You can go to your mother, but swear you'll return before nightfall. I swear! Budur! You're waiting for me? How did you know I'd return today? I didn't. I've waited here a year, day and night, without moving. I'm married and have a son. I can only stay with you for one night. Thank you very much, but if you're married, what good are you to me now? But though I don't want you, I won't let her have you either. Ladies, come out! Help! “Fidelity is good, but so is frivolity!” Aziza has saved you with her words once again. But I'll still punish you, for you deserve it. Get powders for the wound. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, Budur, please! Take this. Pull. Aziz, my son! Where have you been? What have you been doing all this time? Aziza... how good you were to me! How you loved me! Here's what Aziza left for you. Yes, Aziz... now I can give it to you. “This is not the work of Budur but of Princess Dunya. Know, my love, that I blame you for nothing. In fact, I thank God for letting me die before you. Your Aziza.” I searched for Princess Dunya. I entered her garden. I saw her and fell in love with her. But what could I do now? I've become like a woman. What's the matter? Let us go to Dunya's city. I've fallen for her without ever even seeing her. Help me find her and I'll pay you. When my father sees my bloodstained clothes, he'll think I'm dead. That's Dunya's father, perhaps off to visit another king. Come on, Taj. Is the sheik of the market here? Yes, but be careful. He's one of those who prefer bananas to figs. That's him smoking over there. - Greetings, sheik. - What handsome lads! It's a shame you're so dirty from your journey. Before anything else, you must have a nice bath. As the poet said: “May the bath keeper enjoy a long and happy life, for his hand gently caresses a naked body born of water and light.” You'd like to enjoy their beauty in your bath, eh? Certainly! I'm not like our Princess Dunya, who hates men and can't abide any talk of marriage. What's that? Hey, are you the gardener here? Yes. Why? May we see the garden? Just a moment. I'll open the gate. Tell me: To whom does this garden belong? Dunya, the king's daughter. The one who hates men and refuses to marry? - That's the one, sir. - Why does she hate men? She dreamed that a pigeon was caught in a net and saved by its companion. But when the dove then got caught, the pigeon flew off, and the dove was slaughtered. She's thought ever since that all men are like that pigeon. How much does this Dunya pay you? Just one dinar. Listen, I want to create something beautiful here to be remembered by. Like what, sir? Take these 300 dinars for now. Do as you wish here, gentlemen. - Let's go. - What are you going to do? Are you looking for work? I need two laborers. At your service. Three dinars a day each. - No, that won't do. - Four. Six. Nine. We'll only work for you if you pay us just one dinar a day each. Are you two brothers? Not blood brothers. Just brothers in God. Why did you become holy men who wander around living off alms? To serve God. Tell me what happened to bring you to this point. It will lighten your work and perhaps teach this young man something too. If it magnifies the glory of God, I'll tell you my story. Thank you for helping me. I'm dying of hunger and thirst. But I'll reward you, for I'm the son of a king. Bandits attacked us as we carried gifts to our ally, the king of India. You'd best tell no one of that. Our countries are enemies, but I'll shelter you. I'll be no trouble. I can work. I'll pay for my needs. I've studied. I can write and do sums. I know science and literature. Your learning is worthless here. Money is all people care about here. You can chop wood outside the city if you like. Are you man or demon? I'm a man. - How did you find this place? - I don't know myself. Perhaps fate meant to put an end to my sorrow and pain. Who are you, child? The daughter of a king. A demon carried me off and locked me in this tomb. Every ten days he comes and makes love to me. If I need him, I have only to touch the words engraved on that tablet and he comes. My love... I want to free you from that demon! You must be mine alone. I'll take you away from here. If the demon comes, he'll answer to me! Run! Get away! He'll be here any minute, and he'll kill you! Do you know who these shoes belong to? No, we've never seen them before. I seek the owner of these shoes. Would you know who that is? No, none of us lost those shoes. Tailor, would you know the owner of these shoes? Shahzaman... a stranger found your shoes! There's your lover. Kill him and you'll be spared. Kill her... and I'll let you go unharmed. I can't kill a woman I've never seen before and who's never hurt me! There's love between you two. You've made love with your eyes. I can't be certain you've betrayed me with her. I won't kill you, but neither will you go unpunished. I beg you: Be merciful. Set me free. Set aside all hope of that. Rise up! Rise up... you damned monkey! In the great name of God and by his power, become that which your nature most craves to be. A monkey! Come here! Come on! Captain... before we reach port, an account of our voyage must be written on this scroll. - We overlooked it, sir. - I'll handle it. Where are you going? “Allow destiny to take its course, and accept willingly what it brings. Be neither happy nor sad about anything. But if you open the inkwell of power and grace, be certain your ink is that of goodness and generosity.” This calligraphy is truly beautiful. None of my advisors write in this script so well. Dress the author in garments of honor and lead him here in a procession. Ibriza, look. Father, how can you bring a strange man to see me? Is what my daughter says true? You're a man and not a monkey? Is that right? That's not a monkey but a man. Then I pray you, in God's name, free him from his present condition, for I would appoint him vizier. I shall obey your command. Though it cost me my life, you are welcome here. Poor monkey. But your soul was stronger than your form. Thank you for giving me back my soul. She sacrificed her life for me and was consumed by flames. My grief was such that it could have shattered mountains. I felt I had offended God. Why would you renounce your wealth, status, and learning? Not out of generosity but because of destiny and as a judgment on humankind. - God be with you. - And also with you, stranger. I wish to entrust you with a mission as if you were my oldest friend. Very well. What is it? God has revealed to me that at noon tomorrow, you will come to me on that island across the gulf and find me dead near a well. Wash my body and wrap me in the shroud you'll find beside me, and bury me. Then take my turban and tunic, and when someone appears and asks for them, give them to him. - Very well. One, two, three, four... Yunan, my son. Keep your eyes closed and listen to me. The see, Yunan, the see. Go to your father and ask permission go on a sea voyage. Father. We have islands across the sea, don't we? Yes. Why? I want to outfit a ship and visit them. You, set out to sea? What kind of idea is this? You, who's afraid even of taking a bath, who still plays with children, and who sleeps all day long? Father, I want to see the world and travel the sea. Climb the mast and tell us what you see! To starboard the surface is teeming with fish. Straight ahead is a shadow that's sometimes black and sometimes white. We're doomed! We'll all perish! What's happening? We're near Black Stone Mountain, where a copper knight stands beneath a copper dome. As long as he stands there, every ship will be drawn to the mountain and smashed on the rocks below. Yunan... dig beneath your feet. There you'll find a copper bow and a lead arrow. Shoot the knight beneath the dome with your arrow. Send him crashing into the sear and free the world of this curse, Stay down there. Don't come out for any reason. - All right, Father. I'll open this door when I return. Farewell, Father. Farewell, my son. Who are you? What do you want? Go away! Don't kill me! You don't mean to kill me? You won't kill me, will you? I'm glad you've calmed down. I am a king, the son of a king, and your friend. I don't mean to kill you. Why would I? I turn 15 today, and prophets told my father, the king, that on this day I would be killed by a young man with no eyes who would come from the sea and free the world by toppling a great copper knight. But in exchange an innocent victim would have to die - me. Then trust in the goodness of God and be happy. I'm glad I was shipwrecked and ended up here to defend you, for anyone seeking to harm you will answer to me. Thank you. I'm glad you're my guest here, even if it's underground. There's a beautiful bath here. Go inside. As the poet says: “Happy is the bath boy whose hand touches Ali's breast and Malik's back. The bath may seem like an inferno, but it is paradise. There you'll find bodies as beautiful as suns and moons.” Come. I too know a poem about the bath. “A life of joy for those who enter the bath waters. Upon them many ponds pour their ardent tears.” Look there... at that boy lying all alone on the beach. Perhaps it's Yunan, my son. Yes, it's him! I recognize him! Yunan, my son, it's me - your father! God be with you, sir. Did someone leave a tunic with you? Yes, sir. Give it to me. What's happening? Farewell, Father. Where are you going, my son? Dunya, look there, in the house! Look how beautiful! Who could have decorated the ceiling? It's beautiful, Dunya. I don't understand. This is the story from my dream. Yes, the dove there is caught in the net. But there's something here that wasn't in your dream. The pigeon you thought flew off like a coward was caught and killed by a bird of prey. Sometimes dreams are poor teachers, because the whole truth never lies in one dream... but in many. Look here carefully, slave, and make no mistake. What's this called? Tell me. - Then it's called your pigeon. - Wrong! Then you tell me! It's called perfumed meadow grass. Thank God for perfumed meadow grass. Now it's my turn. Come here. What's this called? Look carefully. Don't make a mistake. Perfumed meadow grass. Wrong, stupid! Then what's it called? Peeled pomegranate. You're not done yet. What's this called? Look carefully. Don't get it wrong again. - Peeled pomegranate. - Idiot! That's wrong. Then what is it? The Inn of Good Fare. Really? And what's this called? Look carefully! No mistakes! - Which of you knows? - I do. Then tell us. This is the donkey that grazes on perfumed meadow grass, eats peeled pomegranates... and spends the night in the Inn of Good Fare! Zumurrud! Tear me to pieces if you like. I'm tired of wandering and searching. I had the most beautiful slave in the world, and I lost her. Come, lion. Kill me! Eat me! Then my suffering will be over. What is it? What do you want? I don't understand. Am I to follow you? All right. I'm coming. Stop! It's dangerous to eat from that dish. Others who ate that rice were killed. Let him eat. We'll see what happens. Let me eat. If I'm killed, it will end my suffering. - What is your name? - Nur ed Din. Dress and perfume this Nur ed Din and bring him to my chambers. Far from killing him, our king's treating him very hospitably. The king must have noticed his beautiful eyes. One needn't wonder. Our king may well prefer melons to plums. I'd have that boy too, my friends! Come here and massage my legs. Come on. Higher. I'll go no higher than your knees. What? You'd refuse to do as I command? Beware! I'll make it very clear: You must do as I say, boy. I want you as my lover. Perhaps as a reward I'll make you an emir. - What do I have to do? - Go lie on the bed. I've never done this before. Take back your presents and let me leave. Obey me! Now go lie on the bed. Or shall I have you beheaded? On your stomach. Pull your pants down. Hurry UP! Please don't hurt me too much. Do you like love poems? Haven't you ever heard one? Don't look at me! Now listen. “The fuzzy down of a first beard has traced, like a poet's pen, two lines in myrtle on a young boy's cheeks. The sun and moon marvel when he appears. No tree has ever yielded so sweetly to the storm.” Fine. You know this other one? Don't look at me! “L spoke of mounting him, and he replied, 'Will you never stop insulting me?' But when I showed him a dinar, that handsome youth said, 'If destiny says you are to mount me, I can't escape it.”' And how about this other one? Don't look at me! “My love is great, and that handsome youth said to me, 'Push that thing in deep with all your might!”' isn't it getting hard? Not unless you touch it. Go on, touch it. You know what awaits if you don't obey. Come on! You're like a woman down there! And now mine is standing up straight! My love, don't you recognize your slave? Zumurrud, my love! You know... I know a poem too. “What a night! God has made no other like it. Bitter was its beginning, but how sweet is its end.”
