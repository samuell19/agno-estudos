KOMPROMAT Kompromat refers to documents used to destroy someone's reputation. The word, like the process, was invented by the Russian secret services. This film and its characters are very loosely based on real events. IRKUTSK, SIBERIA 5 MONTHS EARLIER May I speak to Julia? Thank you. Hello, Julia. It's Mathieu. Fine, and you? Did you get my message? Yes, I found your phone. It's at the house. Can you watch Rose this afternoon? She's not feeling well. She doesn't want to go to school. Okay? Great. Okay. That way you can pick up your phone. Thanks a lot, Julia. See you later. The Alliance Française gives French classes, but we also have cultural activities. - Morning, Fabienne! - Hi! How are you? - Cold! - Yeah. Where were we? - Good morning. - Good morning. Come in! Hello! - How's it going? - Great! Good morning, boss! Vladimir, how are you? Very well. Would you be willing to give an interview to the local TV station? Me? They do a weekly portrait of an Irkutsk celebrity, like you. An Irkutsk celebrity? It's good publicity for us. Why not? - I'll see to it. - Thanks, Vladimir. Good morning, Boris. Good morning, Mathieu. It's not working? It'll work! Good, because it's not exactly hot in here! The magician winter arrives. It's here. Slippery everywhere. Hanging from - the oak tree branches... - Hello? Thanks for calling me back. Boris, I'm on the phone. Is there any way you could come... Boris, Boris! The phone. Okay... Could you stop by at the end of the week? I'm home! France has repaid the 784 million euros the Russians advanced us. You're late. Sorry. I did my best, but... I had things to do. Where you going? - I told you. - No, you didn't. To my yoga class. That's what couldn't be canceled? Rose is in her room. She's not sick at all. See you tonight. Daddy! Sweetheart! - How are you? - Good. I'm so happy to see you. Look, I made you a bear with your name on it. That's beautiful! You made that? Yes. All alone? Thank you, sweetheart. You staying with me today? No, I can't. I have to go back to work. But Julia will be here till Mom gets home. Why can't you stay with me? Because I can't. I have to work, but... Julia's funny, isn't she? No, Julia's not funny. No, that's true, she's not. I have an idea that's funny. I found her phone. Know what we can do? Let's hide it. Okay? Where shall we put it? In the fridge? No, she'll find it right away, won't she? How about in the toaster? Maybe in the toaster. That's a very good idea! Look, we'll put her phone in the toaster, like a slice of bread. Click! And presto! Hey, what are you doing? What's going on? Who are you? What do you want? Shut up! Rose! Julia, call my wife, please! Daddy! Don't cry, sweetheart! It'll be fine! Who the hell are you? It's a mistake! Call the French Embassy! I'm director of the Alliance Française! Shut up! 3 WEEKS EARLIER I thank you all for attending this inauguration. Barely six months since my arrival, I'm extremely proud to be promoting French culture in Siberia. I would also like to thank, in particular, Mr. Ivanovitch, whom everyone here knows. Without your generosity, dear Andrei, we would never have been able to renovate this theater. Thank you, Andrei. As we say in France, enjoy the show! Can you speak to the choreographer? Don't worry, Vladimir, it'll be fine. The Russian mentality is very different from the French. I know. Anyway, it's too late now. Andrei, thank you. - How was I? - Great. This is Michèle, cultural attaché at the French Embassy. - Hello. - You came from Moscow? Yes, I wouldn't miss this! You'll see, it's terrific. Stop squirming. It's about to start. - What? - The show's starting. Honey, we're going home. She's asleep. Stay a while, it just started. She may wake up and start crying. - Let her sleep on your lap. - No. Daddy! Daddy! Rose? Rose, I'm here, sweetheart! Mathieu Roussel? Do you understand Russian? I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. I'm an examining magistrate. Official proceedings have been opened against you. Please, call the French Embassy. Please. You are accused of disseminating child pornography on the internet. Do you understand? Do you understand? That's impossible. In addition, you're accused of molesting your daughter. Listen... That's impossible! The investigation will decide. You are remanded into custody, pending further investigation, in accordance with article 242 of the Russian Federation penal code. Article 242. No. Not that. Please, please... - Okay. - Thank you. Cell 135! Positions! At ease! What, who? What's your name? Mathieu. I'm French. What article? So? Cat got your tongue? Go on! Spit it out! Enough! Keep quiet! Why are you here? What's the charge? Come here. No idea. Come here. That's your bunk. Why are you here, you bastard? Bastard! Answer me! No idea. Why'd they lock you up? You're not here for nothing. Vladimir, excuse me. Where's Ivanovitch? He rushed out of here. Mathieu, this is Svetlana. She taught French here last year. - Pleased to meet you, miss. - Likewise. - He didn't say anything? - Not a word. I was saying how much I loved that ballet. Thank you. - To your health! - Cheers! To the dance and the arts! - Cheers! - Cheers! Welcome to Russia! Welcome to Irkutsk! Cheers! You'll never keep up with them! No, I can't dance. I don't know how to dance! I can't... Cell 135! Positions! Health walk! Not you! If you wanna go for a walk, you have to pay. Don't you have money? The guards took it all. There are three categories here. Men we respect, men we beat, and men we fuck. So, what's the charge against you? Why are you here? Shakir will find out in the yard. He'll know. 242! I'm betting you're a 242. I'm not guilty. You're a strong guy. You'll defend yourself. Cell 135! Positions! Dirty fuck! You like kids? Get over here! I'll kill you, asshole! I'll get you! - Don't you ever smile? - When it's worth the effort. Really? Not too often, it seems. We don't smile at people all day long here. If you're always smiling, you're always lying. We're always lying? Maybe, who knows? May I call you Svetlana? Yes. - You're always smiling. - That's not true. No, I don't think so. You don't even realize it. I'm smiling because I'm happy. You're smiling too. - You're happy too. - No way! It's true. You don't realize it, either. I have to go. Wait! Can we see each other again? I don't think so. - Why? - It doesn't matter. Pretty girl. Pretty girl, I said. Do you know her? I've seen her. Dimitri Rostov. Mathieu Roussel. Boss, to your health! I loved you And perhaps my love Deep in my heart Is not yet extinguished FSB! Stay away from guys like him! - FSB? - They used to be called KGB! I loved you And perhaps my love Was a timid flame and... Hello, Mathieu. Got anything to eat? I'm hungry. I'm sorry, I don't have a thing. The Embassy has to get me out of here, Michèle. Yes, we're working on that. My wife should... make a deposition. Or come here... I'd really like to see her. I'd like to speak to her. I'd like to know how Rose, my daughter, is. Your wife... make deposition. This is Mr. Borodin. He'll be your attorney. I speak small French. My wife saw the police? She spoke to them? Interrogation. Interrogation. Why didn't they let me go, if she saw the... Why am I still here? The judge sent you to prison because your wife made a deposition. One moment. Interrogation Report. "Citizen Alice Roussel told the interrogator that her husband was dangerous." "She asked the authorities for protection, as a witness, and to imprison her husband for threatening her daughter." When your wife was interrogated, she said you abused her and your daughter. She pressed charges and asked for police protection. Protection, yes. That's impossible. He's lying. You're lying! Michèle, what does this mean? Calm down! I've never raised a hand to them. Michèle, you know me! What is all this? Why scream, Mr. Roussel? Your wife says this. Who is this guy? Mr. Borodin's the best lawyer in the city. You're gonna need him. I wanna see Alice. I wanna see my wife. That's all I ask. Your wife and daughter have left Russia. We know they landed in France, so they're safe. But we don't know where they are. They left? He'd like to know about your relationship with your wife. You're not eating? Why keep coming to this restaurant, if you never eat? I'm the only one who likes it. So, tell me... how's your book going? Sorry. I left it on, in case Julia called. Who is it? Mom. Rose has refused to speak to her for days now. Think I should force her to? No, why? It's no big deal. I think the move has upset her a little. I was thinking that maybe... she needs a little brother or sister. You're nuts! Why am I nuts? I don't know. Shouldn't we try to pull through first? Us. What do you mean "pull through"? I thought we did. We are pulling through, aren't we? Sorry. I'll put it on silent. No, what if Julia calls? Your mother again? - No idea. - No idea... Can I see? Mathieu, don't start again. That's just it, I hope not. Mathieu... Show me and we'll drop it! I need some air. I have the right to ask. I have the right. Alice. - Wait! - I wanna go home. The car's this way. I wanna go home to France. What the hell are we doing here? Have you spoken to him again? It's not that. - Was that him? - That's not the problem. Obviously, that's the problem! Why are you doing this to me? You promised me it was over. You promised! Why do this? I don't love you anymore, Mathieu. I wanna go back to France. Fine... then go. What can I say? - But Rose stays! - Because you decide? No, but we're married. There are laws! There are laws? That's not what I mean. I'm miserable. Don't go. It's over, Mathieu! It's over! This came for you. This came for you. On your feet! Hello, Mathieu Roussel. Is free and bracelet. - Pardon? - You are bracelet. Speak Russian. I like to speak French. That's not really French. Speak Russian. I've secured your release under surveillance. - I'm free? - No. But you can stay in your home with an electronic bracelet. Thank you. Thank you. Best lawyer in the city. Please, Mr. Roussel. You're on temporary parole. This electronic bracelet will constantly indicate your position. Any attempt to remove it or alter its signal in any way will set off an alarm. Your telephone will be bugged and limited to local calls. You are forbidden to connect to the internet. You are forbidden from meeting anyone connected to your case. You may go out for two hours a day, between nine a.m. and six p.m., solely to buy essential items. If you don't respect these rules, you will immediately return to prison. Understand? No telephone. No internet. I can't see anyone. Otherwise... back to prison. Understood. Calm. I give you news soon. Counselor... Did you send me food in prison? This... Was that you? Food. You imagine me smiley? No. Impossible. Show me how you dance! Like this! Hi, Julia! - I'll do the ironing. - - Mathieu: Were you wondering why I called you? To discuss the show? You westerners, with your humanism and tolerance, soon you'll outlaw hunting. Hunting's in our blood, it's part of our Russian secular culture. Have you ever shot at a living target? Never. Wanna try? Don't you want to try? Thank you very much. Not today, thanks. - Not today. - Not today. I understood. Wolves! Wolves? You haven't asked what I thought of your show. You left so quickly. That show was a perfect example of the decadence of your culture. Perversity posing as open-mindedness, creative freedom, and God knows what else. Your so-called moral values are distorted and degrading. You're governed by cowards. And you, concretely, you represent everything we loathe, I loathe. Excuse me, I didn't... You represent everything we loathe. Everything I loathe. But... And I'll never finance you again. Understood? I'll never finance you again. You have exhausted your credit. Please contact your provider. Hello, Mr. Roussel. Thank you for coming. Please... can you buy me a SIM card for a cell phone? Telephone. I'll pay you back. I'm an attorney. Not an accomplice. Sir, I... If you find a telephone, no calls. Never. Only encrypted messenger, Signal, Telegram, Darknet. Regular internet, no! Otherwise, straight to prison. Know what they say about me? Do you know? If I go back to jail, I won't come out alive. I can't go back to jail! I'm late, Mr. Roussel. Who is it? Do you know? No idea. Goodbye, Mr. Roussel. 5:20 p.m... 5:15 p.m. Now where's he going? Hello, Svetlana. Keep shopping. Cops are watching. Did you send me food in jail? Why? I thought you'd say "thank you," not "why?" Why doesn't matter. Thank you. You saved my life. That's what matters. Help me one last time? I need you to buy me this. - Can you? - Why me? Why doesn't matter. I don't know anyone else. Here, tomorrow, same time. I'm late. Your father's coming to dinner. I remember. And he'll be early again... as usual. See? - Good evening, Svetlana. - Good evening. Is this what you need? Thank you. Do you have a trial date? No, not yet. They said in three months. Maybe it'll be okay. No, it won't be okay. They trapped me. I know. My lawyer says it's the FSB. Every day I think, "What can I say? What can I do?" I swear, I don't know. Remember that guy at the bar where we were dancing? Dimitri Rostov. Head of the FSB in Irkutsk. He's my father-in-law. I hate him. In that case, you know why he launched a kompromat against me. They say you're a spy. Do I look like a spy? What does a spy look like? I don't know, but I'm no spy. I'm not a spy. I believe you. Is that why you left last time? You took off because you saw him at the bar? Him... So he saw us talking, laughing, dancing together. Maybe that's why. Don't you think? A kompromat for that? We were just dancing. - We were drunk. - Mostly you. In any case, you'll never know. - What? - Why the FSB trapped you. That's how it works here. Pretty steep for a dance, isn't it? It wasn't so bad, was it? It wasn't so bad. I have to go. Why? To get home. My husband's waiting. Good luck, Mathieu. Where'd you disappear to? I went out for a drink. Again? Again. Did you dance? I danced. How was it? Fun? Fabulous. Get your hands off me! Slut... Slut! Filthy dancer! PEDOPHILE Alliance Française Director an Accused Pedophile MOSCOW - FRENCH EMBASSY Human rights, etc., and commensurate with those values, we refuse to deliver weapons to Russia until their aggression against Crimea ceases. Will you send me that? I have to go, Julien's calling. I'm on my way. NO PHONES IN THE ANECHOIC CHAMBER Thank you. Thank you. So? We finally got Mathieu Roussel's indictment file. What a nightmare! A put-up job! It's basically a bunch of crude fabrications. Kompromat? But why Mathieu? What did he do to them? You sure he's not secret service? Not to my knowledge. Those guys are so twisted, you never know. What'll we do? Once he's convicted... They won't convict him if it's all based on gross falsehoods. That file only proves his innocence. They'll have to free him. And admit that the FSB trapped him? They have no choice. They'll convict him. - What'll he get? - Minimum, ten years. Probably 15. Once he's convicted, we'll negotiate his extradition, to serve his sentence in France. That sounds good. And we say what? There's nothing we can do? There is nothing we can do. Are you in contact? Via his lawyer. Let's avoid another crisis. Reassure him. Keep him calm until his trial. Your trial's in three months. You have to wait... ...calmly. Calmly! What could I get? I don't know. Maybe prison, maybe not. I'm working for you. It'll be fine. Listen to me. You'll be sentenced to ten or 15 years in prison. You have no chance. If you have the guts, escape. Take off. Goodbye, Mr. Roussel! Still in Irkutsk? Yes. I've decided to stay till summer. It's already summer Open the door! Is it working now? Okay. I don't know what happened. A bad connection? These things are shit! Made in Russia! Sorry! Let's go. Have a nice day! IRKUTSK - ULAN BATOR Ulan Bator? Yes, Ulan Bator. Get on. Get on. I'm listening. Again? Open the door! Your French guy disappeared. That doesn't surprise you? Sasha! He has a phone. I have his number. Now we'll find him quickly. Yeah. He wrote on Telegram. A few days ago. That's how she got his number. See you tonight. Of course not. She didn't respond, no. No, she didn't respond. RUSSIAN - MONGOLIAN BORDER Your papers, please. Where are you going? We're checking. Passports. What's in the suitcase? Open it. Where are you going? Yes? Have a nice trip. Stop! The Frenchman! The Frenchman escaped! His cell phone was traced here. The bus! Open up! Stop! Stop! Stop the bus! Open the door! Whose phone is this? We're clear. There's a new phone in the bag. How will you cross the border? I don't know. You don't want to tell me. No, it's not that. I really... I don't know, I... I'll improvise. I'll find a way. You're so French. What does that mean? Lots of words, lots of phrases. - You're so... - So what? - Lightweight. - Lightweight? I don't feel especially lightweight at the moment, but... Maybe. Think we're that different? We're tragic. We can't understand one another. You think? Look. Horrible! Erase! No, absolutely not. You're not at all horrible. You're very beautiful. You're very beautiful. I don't usually carpool. There are too many violent people around. But last week, I fell asleep at the wheel... IRKUTSK - KRASNOYARSK - NOVOSIBIRSK Hope you got home okay. I'm sure we'll meet again one day. You have 3 new messages. I got home fine, thanks. Don't stay in contact. It's too dangerous. Good luck, Mathieu Roussel. There they are! Sagarine! Know him? By reputation. He slipped right through your fingers. Have an explanation? It proves that our suspicions were correct. Mathieu Roussel is a spy. I'll catch him. And I'll rid the FSB of suspicions. Yes? Go ahead. He was at Beslan? Three hundred hostages died. Half were children. Killed by terrorists. Not Spetsnaz. They attacked the school with tanks, flamethrowers. The Spetsnaz are animals. And that brute takes us for idiots. We have a lead. We traced his cell phone to the Mongolian border. He had a map of the region in his house. Luckily, he didn't turn off his phone. He had a new number. We got it from an informer. There were theaters everywhere. - We read poetry. - Uh-huh. We were workers, but we had access to culture! But you had nothing to eat, with the communists. What was your relationship with the Frenchman? Professional. I had worked at the Alliance Française. - That's all? - Yes. I heard you liked to dance together. Just once. Only once? Yes, once. So, you like to dance... Then why'd he call you? You'd have to ask him. Because he's your lover? We danced together once. We were a little drunk. That's it. Nothing else happened. He's married. So am I. He's not my lover. He's not my lover. We weren't afraid of them. Yeah. In the stores, there weren't many brands of detergent. We had one. Good luck, Mathieu Roussel. Show me his message on your phone. I erased it. There! No luck. I kept his number, just in case. In case of what? Give me your phone. Unlock it. I'd like to continue speaking French. At least in writing... How much did he pay you to help him escape? - I didn't help him. - Of course you did. That's enough! Get out! I really hate when little whores lie to me! Are you crazy? Especially whores like you. That's what you are, Svetlana Rostova. A foreign spy's little whore. Sasha, stop! Sit down! - Please, leave. - A little whore! Where is that bastard? I don't know. This FSB guy's looking for you. Be careful. Don't answer me. This is where Mathieu Roussel, of the Alliance Française, lived with his wife and daughter. He was arrested on February 21 for spreading child pornography on the internet. On April 16, he was released with an electronic surveillance bracelet. Avoiding questioning only proves his guilt. An international arrest order has been issued and everything is being done to prevent him from crossing the border. To date, pedophilia is considered the most serious crime... Hello? I have info on the Frenchman. You know, I like to think of myself as a philosopher. I've traveled a lot. Especially in Europe, but also in Israel, Central Asia, even in the United States, where I've given seminars. Everyone has the right to believe in whatever God he likes, at the moment he believes. But if you don't believe in God, you can't understand the universe or its origins. Could I have a little water? Thank you. Shit... Are you Catholic in Switzerland? Protestant, too. So, you believe in God Almighty? Of course. Of course. The Frenchman's still in the country. Someone's helping him. Who? I don't know. It doesn't matter. I think the professor's learned his lesson. Let him go back to the Sorbonne. It doesn't depend on me anymore. Nor on you. Moscow's in charge now. They won't let him go home. Any regrets? May he burn in hell! Get your papers ready, son... The Tsar's police. My papers... are in my backpack, in the trunk. Your papers. Where are you going? Moscow. - For what reason? - I'm going home. Open the trunk. There's nothing in there. The trunk! You should be ashamed, wasting my time, you nitwit! I'm Alexandre Alexeivitch, bishop of the patriarch of Moscow, and you treat me like a criminal. Get lost, before I call the Kremlin! Okay, go ahead! Get out of my way! Bunch of idiots! Thank you! Do you wish to confess, my son? Not today. Thank you. Ambassador, sir, I got this ten minutes ago. He's in Moscow? Not Mongolia? I don't know. What do I say? - Yes? - Stay where you are. The FSB may be staked out, outside the embassy. Okay, fine. The gendarmes will check. - Okay. - Don't budge. Yes? Cross the street and walk to the gate calmly. Come in! So you managed to cross all of Russia without being caught? I opened a PayPal account and reserved rooms and rides with a fake name. That's how I got here. Could I have a piece of meat, sir? Hats off to you! Really! For an Alliance Française director, you're pretty resourceful. Thank you. Does anyone know you're here? No. No one must know. The Russians, the press. No one. No outside communication. Okay. You're putting us in deep shit. We have more comfortable apartments, but they're less discreet. Keep them closed, day and night. I'll stop by to see you regularly. The cook will bring your meals. Thank you, Michèle. You won't lock me in? Of course not, I trust you. Do you need anything else? My daughter. I'm sure you'll see her soon. Have you seen the video? No. What video? Your lawyer received it in the mail, on a USB drive. But you'd already left Irkutsk. My name is Alice Roussel. The documents accusing my husband are false, which I was forced to sign. I was given the choice of signing those papers or going to prison and sending my daughter to an orphanage. That's why I agreed to sign those papers. But my husband is innocent. He's a wonderful father. They'd have convicted you, anyway. You were right to escape. Thank you, Michèle. See you later. - When did he leave? - I don't know. My husband and I were watching TV. - When did he leave? - I don't know. I didn't see him. Our objective is to smuggle you out of the country. We'll take a diplomatic car from the embassy. You'll be hidden under a blanket. An eight-hour drive to here. Good. And then? You'll cross the border, into Estonia, on foot. How many kilometers will that be? About 20. At night. Okay, great. Twenty kilometers through a forest with wolves and armed border guards. - Who shoot on sight - It won't be easy. Okay. When? We'll let you know. You okay? Can I respond this time? Please I'm sort of okay. And you? Sort of? Are you in France? Not yet. Soon, I hope. Can I call you? You don't answer anymore? Sorry. I'm here now. Everything okay? Yes. I went to the supermarket today. I thought of you. I think I miss that supermarket a little Want me to send you a delivery? Come in. Thank you. Hello. Have a seat. We have two important things to tell you. Good news and bad news? One's bad and one's very bad. You've been convicted, in absentia, to 15 years of forced labor. I can't imagine... what the very bad news could be. I spoke to Russian authorities this morning. They know you're within these walls. They know or suspect? - They know. - How could they know? How do I know? In any case, they asked questions. Precise and insistent. I had no choice but to admit that you were here. You had another choice. You could have lied. I won't endanger our relations with Russia for you. Who do you take yourself for? I take myself for a guy who's innocent and asking for his embassy's help. The Russians seem convinced of your guilt. It is crazy that the FSB would put so much energy into bringing down a simple Alliance Française director. Why? Hold on... Is that a real question? What are you insinuating? What do you mean, "why"? How do I know why? I don't know why! Because I don't like hunting? Because I play princess with my daughter? Because I watch two men kiss on stage? Because you wouldn't give them those damned helicopter carriers? Because I danced with some FSB guy's daughter-in-law? I don't know! Because they hate who I am, that's why! Who cares? What do we do now? It's not up to me to dictate your behavior but... Maybe you should consider surrendering to Russian authorities. I don't get it. Those people had a plan to cross the border. Smuggling you out of the country is out of the question. That would be a grave diplomatic error. With consequences... So I should turn myself in? And do 15 years? You'd only spend a few weeks in prison here... and I promise... Yeah, right! ...to have you transferred to France, to serve your sentence in comfortable conditions. With every possible pardon. But I'm innocent, damn it! I didn't do anything! What if I refuse? You gonna throw me out? Certainly not. But you'll never leave here. Okay, fine. So I'm a prisoner, is that it? The only solution is to turn yourself over. Russians think the French are cowards. They're right. We said you'd quit that. Yeah... You have to sleep. What are you doing to me? Remember Catherine? She works at the Alliance Française in Moscow. They're looking for someone like me. I have an interview tomorrow. You're going to Moscow for the interview? That job's an opportunity. You're right. But what'll we do in Moscow? And what do we do here? That's true, too. When will you be back? The day after tomorrow. Hm? And it's also that friendship that we wanted to celebrate today, as we do every year. Hello! - How are you? - Fine! Shit! He disappeared. Search every street. He can't be far. You two, that way! You, that way. Shit! - Mathieu! - Run! Come here! Why? Why do all this for me? Why! Again "why"! Right. The why doesn't matter. You know why, don't you? I think so. Then why ask the question? I don't know. How does he know she's in Moscow? She rented a car. I always knew that girl was a whore. And you believed her? Damn cuckold! You're a nice guy... What? Maybe you like having a wife who spreads her legs for foreigners! No problem... No problem? And that's my son! You're a filthy fag! You're not my son! That's fine. - Get the hell up! - Don't touch me! Some Chechen war hero! Stand up! - Don't touch me! - Get up! You'll never see her again. That's enough, Dad! You'll never see her again! Go fuck yourself! Yes? Yes. Understood. They were spotted at a gas station near Ostrov. Route M9. He's trying to get to the Estonian border. Let's go. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. There's a... a big clearing there that should help me. See, I'm going there. Okay, I'm going. Soldiers take this to stay awake. They're amphetamines. I'm no soldier, you know. Why don't you come with me? Come with me. I'd wind up hating myself. Why? Do you still love him? Go, Mathieu. I'm not going without you. If I leave you here alone, they'll take revenge! Rostov will never do anything to me. You're the one he hates. Do you realize how beautiful this is? This never happens. When it does, you grab it. Stop. Afraid I'll convince you? Is that it? I'm not afraid of anything. Go on. Go home, Mathieu. I still love him. I'll call you. I won't answer. Stop the car. That has to be him. Let's go! Shall I call the border guards? No, don't bother. He's ours and he won't make it out of the woods. The wolves will finish the job. - Understand? - Of course. Very good then. Shit! Stay calm. branches cracking) Shit... You don't attack men, you know that. Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! DIMITRI ROSTOV CALLING VOICEMAIL FROM SASHA It's me... I want to say that... it's not your fault. And that... you're free now. I love you, Sveta. Sasha? Sveta... Sasha... Sasha hanged himself. It's all my fault. Me, alone. It's my fault. Forgive me. I'll be there by early afternoon. No! Don't come back. You don't have to. Live your life! Who do you take me for, Dimitri Rostov? Forgive me. Forgive me! Shit! This isn't the clearing. Daddy! I lost your bear, sweetheart. That's okay. Mathieu Roussel Is Back in France
