"The flower hideout honors the goddess of creation and death. The goddess died after bearing the fire god who set fire to her womanhood.' Oryu! Oryu! Tomi has gone into labor! Has she! Reljo! I'm off to deliver tomi's baby. Please look after hikonosuke! Off we go! Oryu, tomi's scared of having a nakamoto boy. What? She doesn't want the baby. She worries too much. But the baby's father took off with another woman. It might be the nakamoto curse. The millennial rapture Hikonosuke. Is it painful? I deserve... to suffer this much. Mr. reijo... Are you sure nobody on ukishima island knows, that I'm hiding in this shed? Nobody, except oryu and me. When the woman stabbed me in the stomach... A divine voice spoke to me. Take the punishment... For the sins of the nakamoto men. Wait in the ukishima woods for a sign. Don't tell no one. Wait? For a sign? Now... I must accept my punishment alone. Except for you, who found me in the woods. Tomi's about to give birth. Isn't it your baby? Yes. Don't you want to see your child? All became clear to me, while I was lying here. My dad hung himself and one of my uncles went blind. It's the curse of our blood. The nakamoto blood? It's foul. It's not foul. The nakamoto's are nobility in the roji of the outcasts. They are not sinful! In ancient times, my people were victimized and were called traitors. As a result they were declared sinners... The unholy clan. A noble, yet unholy clan? - Mr. reijo... - Yes? I must offer myself now. Leave me now. What are you waiting for? Gol hikonosuke... Hang on! It's coming! Whatever sins you're born with, I'll bring you into this world. Don't be afraid. Now, come out! Come out! Come on. Come to me! Come to me! Shiny as a little Buddha. You made it all the way into this world. It's a messenger cuckoo calling... Did you just return from the netherworld? Auntie! Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Not bad for an old woman like me. I'll make some gruel. Auntie, it's such a beautiful day! I'll wash your nightgown. All she does is sleep. She deserves to rest, after bringing us into this world for generations. For generations? Right, auntie was a midwife and her husband reijo was a monk. They watched over everybody in the roji from birth till death. Reljo. On this same day, many years ago, I delivered my first baby. That was the birth of hanzo nakamoto. On the day hanzo was born, his father, hikonosuke, died. Read a good sutra for him. Reljo? It's the cuckoo again. It's just the right bird for a midwife and a monk. On the morning hanzo was born, a bird was in full song, too. Hanzo was a true nakamoto man. He was the very first boy I delivered. His father was hikonosuke. On the day hanzo was born, he was stabbed by a woman he'd run off with. He disappeared into the woods of ukishima island. Hanzo's mother was tomi. When hanzo was five, tomi ran off with some man. Was hanzo that young, when tomi left him? Dear... You're asking me? You're the literate one, who kept the records. Don't tell me, you forgot. You've got a good memory. Since I'm illiterate, whatever I forget, may as well haven't happened at all. In these hands... I held him before his mother had the chance. I will never forget that. Hanzo lived with distant relatives and friends. Despite his unsettled childhood, he grew up to be a healthy man. Auntie! Auntie! It's been a while. Hanzo! He will live with us from now on. Really? I can't believe, you're the same baby, I held in my arms! That's why I'm called auntie. - Auntie, you were born old. - Hey, watch your mouth! Since you're living in the roji now, you should be more neighborly. Hanzo, visit me, whenever you need help. Much appreciated. Let's go. Working hard? I have to put food on the table. - Did you hear the rumor? - Which one? About hanzo. He's no longer a boy, he's a man now. What's that? And her husband has no idea. When he's out, Kane and hanzo fool around. Isn't that heavy? Oh, hanzo! Appreciated. Is reijo around? He's performing a service somewhere. Auntie. I'm being sent off to work in Osaka. What? At the steel mill. The steel mill? I got caught. Kane's husband caught us, while we were fooling around. She seduced me. And it felt good. "You backstabber, clean up your act!" I had an earful. Don't listen to him. Be yourself. Just be grateful for the gift of life. That's what I think, every time I see you. And I pray to Buddha. Auntie... Come on! - I've taken care of it. - Thank you. Well, off I go. Hanzo! You can always come back to me. I'll be here. What's wrong? I'm thinking about the nakamoto men. Hanzo is being sent to Osaka. He's a nakamoto man. With their good looks, women can't leave them alone. And they all die young. I'm all too familiar with the deaths of the nakamoto men. Nobody escapes his own blood. We can only watch as a midwife and a monk. Auntie! It's me. How can you forget me? Hanzo...! I'm back. Hanzo! I had no idea, because of this outfit! - Auntie. - What? Yukino, my wife. You're married. Auntie... we're renting a place down there. I'll work in the mountains. Some friends found me work as a day laborer. Good. Auntie, can you help yukino if necessary? I'd be glad to. I appreciate it. See you. - Auntie. - What? She's pregnant. Will it be okay? She doesn't know about the nakamoto's. Neither about dad, nor about grandpa. Don't worry about it. Any life in a woman's womb, is a gift from Buddha. It's something good! Okay. (Go now. See you. Let's go. Have a nice day. Be careful. Hanzo, you're late! See you at sunset. What was that, hanzo? We'll meet later for a date. Well done! Auntie. Is it painful to give birth to a baby? You're pushing a life into this world. It tears you to shreds. Oh, well... But don't worry. When you hear the baby's first cry, you'll feel so thankful and enraptured, that you'll forget the pain. - Was it the same with you? - Yes. Where is your child...‚Äù He died. He died of sickness, when he was two. We were so poor we couldn't afford a doctor. Let's hurry, so that we finish, before the sun sets! Working hard? - You, too, oryu? - Yes. The nishimuras are having their second child. How wonderful! There are so many babies this year. - Hanzo's wife is full-term, too. - Speaking of hanzo... He's seducing girls all the time in true nakamoto style. Who told you so? I saw him in full action when I was working. He's always with women at sunset. Hanzo. I hear you're busy seducing women. Women won't leave me alone. That's grand. Auntie. You're the only one around here, I haven't touched. Look at this. You ever done anything like that with reijo? You can give me a love bite if you can keep it secret. It disappears anyway. Hanzo! Just ask, if you want to give me one! Listen. This is your child I'm bearing! Feel it. Honey? Honey! What's wrong? You poor lost puppy. Such a pretty face. Come with me. I'm so happy. I've been watching you. That bird sings beautifully. It sure does. Since my husband died, three years ago, I've been sleeping alone. Please... You might want it, but mine is full of menace. I don't care, what's in it. You made it all the way into this world. Auntie... How adorable. Hanzo. Where have you been? Auntie... Look at the baby. A beautiful little Buddha of a baby. Come on, hold your son. I had this tailored for you. Oh, it really suits you well! You're even more handsome now. Hanzo is the widow's pet dog. Her sexual appetite killed her husband. Who tells you these things? Everyone around here knows it. The black widow will eat hanzo alive. See you later. Hanzo. On your way to the widow? You're really something. Auntie. Do you want a bird? A bird? There's an interesting parakeet, that sings like a songbird. If it just mimics songbirds, I'd prefer a messenger cuckoo. A messenger cuckoo? There are many in the hills. They were singing, when you were born. What are they like? They're this big. They sing as they fly between this world and the netherworld. Auntie. Is reijo's thing this big? What? I bet he hardly uses it. So yours must be this small? Hanzo. Don't underestimate women. No matter how big yours is, we can handle it. I've seen many women giving birth, so I know. Even a demon, couldn't break it. I can almost smell the blood. You came into this world all covered in blood. I washed you, with these hands of mine. I'll get you the fake songbird. What do you think? I can ask the lumber office to give you work. Or wherever else you want. You're too good for day labor. Leave the wretched roi... 'Wretched roji'? You'd better watch your mouth! I can give you anything you want. Really? Give me this bird then. Hanzo did that? He begged for my forgiveness and said, he'd never see the widow again. Did he? He told me to give this to you. What a strange bird. What's hanzo doing now? He went off to work early in the morning. You can relax now. Good morning! Good morning. Is hanzo around? He's been up at the lumber cabin for two days now. I see. Shinichiro! Goodbye. Hanzo. Three days without a woman. Aren't you bored yet? I'm fine. I've been using it too much lately. Only a stud like you could say that. That's right. Okay, let's get this done before lunch. Right. Hanzo! That's a sacred sakaki tree. What's wrong? Sakaki trees belong to the mountain god, and shouldn't be touched in the mornings. He may curse us. Curse? Do we have some sake? I'll go check. Please, forgive us. Sake will cleanse our deeds. Sorry about that. Apologize to the god. Careful! Sorry, it was my fault. It was dumb of me. I was clearing bushes, when I injured myself. How come...? Hanzo chopped down a sakaki tree this morning. - The god must have cursed us. - No, jinosuke! We cleansed it, so don't blame him. - Then why? - Where's hanzo? He went somewhere to get money for the doctor. I hope this is enough. Thank you. Don't thank me. It's nothing. Did you invite me here, just to ignore me? Don't go! You came all this way. Join us for a drink. Hurry! Pour me some sake! I'll come and pour you one. Who are you? He needs a drink, after coming so far. Sit down. You know the parakeet you took? He trained it. You took... the parakeet? Yes, I'm enjoying it very much. I brought it home when, it was a chick. I taught it to sing like a songbird. I put a lot of work into it. Let me get more sake. Listen. If you can tame a parakeet that well, I bet you're the same with women. We can tame a woman together... And make her sing. I'm talking about her. Sorry about the wait. What's going on? You know what you're doing! That's a nakamoto face. And this is the nakamoto blood. Hanzo? What happened to you? A woman did it. Because I said I'd leave. You poor thing. What do you think, auntie? This scar will make me more attractive. Right? Yes. You can grill my mushroom some time. Hanzo... Any time you wish. Go home to your wife. Did you hear? Hanzo's at it again. I know. After he left the widow, he began to visit the pawnbroker's wife. Auntie! The pawnbroker stabbed hanzo! Auntie! Hanzo was... He was stabbed by the pawnbroker! - I see. Where is he? - By the water. Idiot! - Please, don't die! - Hanzo! Don't die. Hanzo! Hanzo! Come on, hanzo! Come on! Hanzo! Hanzo. Hanzo... It's his nakamoto blood. All the nakamoto men... End up like this. Miyoshi gazed at the nakamoto blood, seeping from hanzo. He just stood there, and kept staring at the blood. Miyoshi... was a nakamoto man, too. He was the youngest son of tatsu, hanzo's over-sexed grandfather. Tatsu got many women pregnant. He was born shortly before tatsu hung himself. Masae taguchi was his mother. On the night miyoshi was born, He's been stubborn from the time he was born. So, he was born that way? He cried a lot. Like he was resisting something. Masae... Raised miyoshi at the taguchi family home. But when miyoshi was fifteen, he left. He stayed with friends. He and his wayward gang, were always in trouble. Auntie? Auntie! I got you something nice. What is it? Some delicious pineapple! You stole them? We looted a warehouse. When will you get work? I wanted to work on a boat. But, they won't hire men from the roji, like me. Maybe I'll become a monk and feed on funeral sweets. You're all talk. Auntie, I'll get you some lipstick. It's been a while, since I put some on. Oryu! Namaste centipedes crawl, bite and sting... You infidel! Namaste centipedes crawl, bite and sting... Thanks for this! Hey, what about this? It's a bargain! - Made in usa! - Only available here. Young-lady! Come here, you want some? Say "yes" and you might get one... Not interested? Fella, take a look at this! - Only here! - Made in usa! Speak up! Take a look at these! Look! You won't get them cheaper! I waited so long for this. My head feels so good. Auntie, I can go by myself from here. Okay. You've been so kind to me. Take care of yourself. I will. Shinichiro. Life goes on. Don't listen to anybody. Just remember who you were, on the day you were born. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hang on tight and live. So, hanzo's kid is leaving. They'll live in Osaka. Is there anything good in Osaka? This is wrong, miyoshi. I only feel alive, when I'm stealing or shooting up. A life with no action bores me to death. Hey, kid! - Hey! - What? You sell hot goods. Piss off! Why don't we talk? What? I have an interesting offer. Kid, I see you can drink. How about women? Is ranko in? Yes. She can help the kid to become a man. Don't be stupid. I've had plenty of women. Did they ever take you to heaven? Ranko can take you there. Oh, Mr. kuwahara. Welcome. Looks like we have a first timer. I want you to be nice to this kid. You have a pretty face. Come. Don't be shy. How did it go? That's perfect. Pour me some. Kid! Come over here. How was it? Isn't she something? The best, I've ever had. We should talk about the job now. That's right. Naoichiro is my partner. We like you, kid. You're gutsier than your average punk. We need help on a big job. A big job? We're going to break into a house. A rich guy in udono, who used to be head of the county. He had servants and maids in the old days, but now it's only him and his wife. His house is full of money and valuables. We know where they're kept. How about joining naoichiro and me in this venture? I've been waiting for this. What? This is just the kind of thing I've been waiting for! Really? I'm in! Bring us more sake, pop! And hurry up. Alright! - Ready? - Yes. Kid, go and check over there. Brother! I can't open it here. Let's take it. I'll carry it. Hide in here until dawn. Okay? We can't walk around with the safe. Kuwahara will be back at dawn. - Brother. - What? You're one hell of a thief! Naoichiro, give me the safe. You'll get your share three nights from now at the tavern. Count me in on the next job. Sure, I look forward to it. What shall we do next, bro? Let's buy some women. Hookers are sweet. Fool, nobody beats my wife. Anything good happened? Why? I just can tell. Welcome. Give me a bottle. Did you hear about that burglary in oroshi town? I know... They broke in two nights ago, and then again in oroshi last night. In the second burglary the owner was killed. Who could be behind it? I wonder... I have a hunch. It's probably kuwahara and naoichiro. You think so? Naoichiro would do anything, to get what he wants. Right? They've got away with it before, but now they'll have to lay low. Oh, I know you. How's the tin business going? - Gotta go. - What? Mrs. oryu. What's up? - Oh, thank you! - They're from the mountains. You're too kind. Did you hear that sando and yoshiki are working at the dam? So, that's why I haven't seen them lately. It was time those punks grew up. I wonder... What miyoshi's been up to? I haven't heard anything about him. - I better go. - Thank you. See you around. Watch it! Miyoshi. How've you been? You've become a man since I last saw you. I guess so. How old are you now? I'm 22. Sando and yoshiki got work at the dam. How boring. Miyoshi. Stay away from meth. I haven't had any. See? What's this? So you saw it. Okay, I'll show you. This is incredible...! I figured it'd spice up my life, but it didn't. Miyoshi. This is your talisman. My talisman? Do I need protection? Auntie. I won't end up like hanzo. I say, to hell with the nakamoto family blood! Miyoshi... Bro! Bro! Brother! Who are you? You confused me, idiot. - Hey, what's with you? - Asshole. Bro! Bro! I've been looking all over for you. Follow me. I was at a construction site. Construction site? Upstream of totsugawa river. There was a break-in in oroshi one day after our job. A man got killed. Were you behind that, brother? What happened to the safe we took? What safe? - From that house. - I don't know. Kuwahara took it with him... Oh, I remember, he opened the safe, but I don't know what was in it. But... Talk to kuwahara about your share. I didn't get mine either. - Where is he? - Dunno. - Brother. - What? I'm not complaining. I've never had so much fun. I felt so alive on that job! Make me your partner. - You? - I want to steal... with you! It's not as easy as that. I'm not stealing or pushing meth anymore. I went straight. But brother... Reijo, we have to hold a memorial service for chiyo nishimoto. And... I know. For our boy too. Recite a sutra for him. I will. You make it so depressing. Reciting sutras is my occupation. You look like it's the end of the world. I can't steal and shooting meth has become boring. I'm going to the dam. Really? You won't go. I'm leaving today. Sando"s mom gave me the foreman's address. Alternatively, I could become a monk like you and chant sutras. What do you know about Buddha? Auntie, reijo is missing opportunities. What? If I'd go to people's houses to recite the sutras, I'd figure out, how to break in at night... - Miyoshi! - Buddha shall punish you! Namaste centipedes crawl, bite and sting... Punk! I'm leaving. Miyoshi! Auntie'll always be here. Visit me any time. One last time... Hello. What a looker! I thought you were a movie star. - Why'd you run away? - What do you want? Good question. I'm married. So what? Well? You want him or not? Where shall we go? What a nice view you have! My husband is away on business. And he's not coming home tonight? What's wrong? I wonder, if miyoshi made it to the construction site. He's too pretty for that. It's a pity. It's the nakamoto blood tormenting those boys with pretty faces. It's beautiful... Still haven't had enough? Because you make it so good. Don't go away. When you departed this life, dad became a monk. And mom became a midwife. Serving Buddha has become our life. So you didn't go to the construction site. Come in. Wait! Who is it? Miyoshi. Auntie... I... killed a man. Come in, quick! I'm with somebody. What? Come here. Hurry up and come in! What's going on? Reljo, close your eyes to this. I beg you. Right? Must be a bad dream... Take off his clothes. Hurry up! Okay. Here! I met her on the way to the construction site. Her husband was away at the time. After we slept together, I told her, that burglary excites me. It's all my fault. He knows his way around our house. So I said he can break in. For a thrill, I wanted to do it, when her husband was at home. Who's there? Who are you? Damn thief! Before I knew it, I was running with him. And now...? What are you going to do now? You can pretend that you know nothing. But miyoshi can't. Right... You can stay until dawn. Then you have to go. You should go home. Miyoshi. Sorry about last night. The woman went home. Good. Well... What's wrong? Sometimes my vision's blurry. Maybe it's the family curse? Miyoshi. Auntie. I'm going to work. On the dam in the mountains. Have some breakfast first. I'm going now. Auntie. Why did I have to... Go after that woman that day? I just... I just wanted to... I wanted to live like fire. Like a huge ball of fire! That's all I wanted. You did. Auntie knows that very well. Since the day you were born, you've lived like a great ball of fire. Thank you. Miyoshi went to the dam construction site. He was there for a whole year, working hard as an earnest day laborer. Until... Wasn't it tatsuo nakamoto, who brought miyoshi back? Yes, it was hanzo's cousin, tatsuo. Auntie! Have you seen miyoshi? What? I brought him to the hospital from the mountains. What happened? I met him at the dam. He'd gone blind and crushed his thumb with a sledge hammer. What? I took him to the hospital. He stayed the night with us, but was gone in the morning. Oryu, come with me. Come to the docks. It's miyoshi, he's... Auntie! Like all nakamoto men, who redeemed their own sins miyoshi ended his own life. After all he was a nakamoto man, a member of a noble, yet unholy clan. Staring at miyoshi's dead body. Tatsuo realized, that he himself was one of them. Oh, him. He was a good, honest boy. He was happy to do anything I asked of him. Anything? Yes. His father was hanzo's younger uncle. He was called tomishige. His mother's name was ume. On the night tatsuo came into this world... The full moon was shining so brightly in the sky. Like the others, I held tatsuo in my hands, before his mother had a chance to hold him. Oryu. Yes, dear? Pardon? I know everything. Well...? What happened? Auntie, do you need help with anything else? When you've got some time, can you chop some wood? I can do it right now. I appreciate your help. I'm good at these things. Is reijo at home? He has a funeral service in tenma. He's a busy man. There's a log up in the hills. Can you chop that, too? Sure. One is born and dies. Another one is born and dies... More are born and die... You've made it all this way into the world. Auntie...? You're a Buddha. You're a Buddha. Tatsuo, no... Tatsuo! Tatsuo. Tatsuo. Miyoshi. Hanzo. Tatsuo left the roji soon after that day. He went to a coal mine in hokkaido, hever to come back. I heard that he led a riot ahd was beaten to death. One is born and dies. Another one is born and dies. More are born... And die... Auntie, your gruel is ready. Auntie? Auntie! Auntie! A woman conceives a child, somewhere in the roji. As if to tear her body apart, a child soon arrives into this world. No matter what the future may bring. No matter what destiny waits for the child. Life starts like water, streaming from a spring. Children keep coming into the world.
