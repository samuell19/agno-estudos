Paris - Mediterranee Two in a car Every little girl, in her imagination creates marvelous images. And since in life, every dream of her prince charming, as handsome as a god Fairy tales, always so appealing and will appeal for ever and ever For the man in our life has always been swept away by love. Our story begins in a big department store. Thousands of people crowd in every day. - Charming, eh? - Yes, charming. - I was talking about the dance music. - Ah, yes... That is, too. Here's the tango you requested, Madam... from "You Are Not the First". Thank you. Do you have the Fox-trot from "When do You Kill Yourself?" Yes, Madame. I'll find it for you. - There you are, Madam. - Thank you very much. - Anything else, Madam? - No, that's all. Give me the bill. Will you come to the cashier, please. You simply must listen to this one, Madam. This is our latest model. There are none better. It's a lovely instrument. Comes with an excellent one-step tutorial. I'll have our pianist play it for you. Mr Mirasol? Mr Mirasol? Mademoiselle, do you know where Mr Mirasol is? Just one moment, Madam. But Mr Mirasol, the department manager wants you! What? Eh? Nothing! Where have you been, Mr Mirasol? Quickly! Start playing that one. And cheerful. Very damned cheerful! 24... 32... 46... ... 57... 62... That's smart of you... You've made me make a mistake. So have I. 24... 32... 46... I was mad about Melanie... Last night she was gone She who had every comfort spent the night outdoors" She just came home to our place relaxed and joyful as always and gave me some silly excuse No matter, tomorrow we'll dance. Is there anything else, Sir? Mademoiselle, I'd be very happy if I could have a Rendez-vous. Ah... "A Rendez-vous" the tango by Christine Aimee... I'd like to meet you alone. "I'd Like to Meet You Alone", the Boston that's a hit. Are you avoiding understanding me? On the contrary, I understand you very well. Goodbye, Sir. We're closing, ladies. Jacqueline, I can't bear your being so nice to all customers... and that you let all the men make a pass at you. What business is it of yours, Mr Mirasol? - Are you my husband or my lover? - No. But actually, I'd like to become one or the other. - Of course, you don't care, - That's right. Watch out! I'll end up committing suicide yet again! Oh Mr Mirasol, what's the matter? Be nice to me... console me! No. No! Miss Jacqueline, is that your final word? Yes. Alright, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, how unhappy I am! - Nearly finished, Jacqueline? -Not quite. If I hurry I will be. What are you doing tonight? I'm meeting someone in the foyer of the Carlton. The Carlton! That's very chic! It's chic and not dear. - Not dear?! - That's right. You sit in a nice armchair. It's entertaining and costs nothing. And you listen to lovely music.. You're so lucky. 'Bye. Have fun. Thanks. 'Bye. Inside of me I feel pleasant excitement whenever I'm listening to music. It fills my heart with the scent of happiness and I listen to music all the time. What will happen to me? I just can't resist it. It's so good, it's so sweet, that music. It's charming, it's disturbing, intoxicating. It has a magical effect to find music in one's heart. - Thank you very much, Sir. - My pleasure, Madam. Excuse me, Sir... I'm waiting for someone here... ...who doesn't know me, and who I don't know. I'll be recognised by clearly carrying in my hand... ...this automobile horn. Perfect. What table are you at, Sir? I'll be over there in that chair, near the column. The person you are waiting for, may be in the music or reading rooms. Yes. A very good point. I'll go and see. Many thanks. - Your mail, sir. - Thank you. Have them left in my room. - Very well, Sir... Bellboy! Sir? Get me a scotch and soda Waiter! A hot-milk coffee. Excuse me, Sir. I forgot to ask you Sir, if you still needed the car today. No, you can leave it in the garage. I also have an automobile, Sir. What is the marque of your car, Sir? I have a Lincoln and a Mercedes. I have a Rosengart. - Good car. - Very good. - And not cumbersome. - Oh yes... very practical! I won it in a raffle at a charity ball It was second prize. First prize was a Citroen. No better. Non. So during the holidays, I'll take a trip to the Riviera. Nice, Cannes, Menton... - In a Rosengart? - Of course... Excuse me. Tell me, what is it you're doing with that horn? It's to identify myself to someone. I'm waiting for someone who's coming with me on my trip. You see, I... Sorry. I put an ad in Th paper. Listen to it and you'll see. "Auto owner..." "Auto owner..." "looking for someone to accompany him to the Riviera during holidays" "and pay for petrol and tyres." "Write to Anatole Biscotte, accountant at Chamorel & Co " "Wholesale Hosiery. 12 rue de Provence, Paris. " - And someone replied? - Within 24 hours. Just a moment... Here it is! I had it this morning. Here it is. Bellboy! Do you see that man over there with the horn in his hand? - Yes, Miss. - Ask him to come over here. My sister was employed at Saint-Didier, Thanks to her I can get pet... ...petrol and tyres very cheaply. Tell me as soon as possible where we can meet. J.P. A lady asked to see you. Me? You asked to see me? You were so courteous as to ask to see me, using the bellboy? How can I be of service to you? But... I wrote to you. - I don't recall. - That's my letter. You're the petrol and Tyre lady? - Oh, I remember very well! - That's good! I'm truly delighted. So you're Mr Biscotte? Yes, Biscotte in person. - Anatole Biscotte. - Jacqueline Pascaud. That's right... J. P. Jacqueline Pascaud. I am absolutely delighted! But you have an English accent? Yes. My mother was English. My father is old man Biscotte... at our establishment. We do a lot of business with England. I'm in charge of correspondence in the business which is... Would you come through here? ...Chamorel and Company. Hosiery wholesalers, 12 rue de Provence. I'll give this J.P. another 10 minutes... Waiter, another milk coffee. - So, you have a fortnight's holiday? - Yes, and you? Me? The same. How much are you allowing for this little trip? How much...? Yes... - How much are you allowing? - 60 francs a day. I have 1200 francs in savings. I have to take 300 for shopping. That leaves 900 for food and accommodation. How much do you have saved? Nothing... no I mean not much at all. Let's see... around 2,000. That's terrific. It makes 2,900 francs, all up. That's quite enough to go to the Riviera... ...Cannes, Nice... Perhaps we could make a short visit to Monte-Carlo? Play a little. Win a bit at roulette. Mr Biscotte, you're not a gambler are you? Oh no! Just the occasional flutter. Very well... I think it would be sensible if I were cashier for the trip. - Alright? - Agreed! You are definitely a very practical and lovely young woman. You are very kind, but... There is one point that I would like to clarify. We'd only use our joint fund. I quite understand. A strong and open friendship. - Agreed? - Agreed. I'm sorry, that was accidental. There's my 2000 francs. And here are my vouchers for petrol... 68 litres. - Will that be enough for out trip? - 68 litres? That's enough to do 3 times around the world! I don't ask for much. I want to see the sea, Cannes, palm trees... I've never seen the sea. Provided that nothing happens that keeps us from leaving. Why? If you were to pull out of it tomorrow... Me? What do you take me for?! Besides, you have my 2000 francs. All my savings. Oh, that's true! - So all agreed? - All agreed. Saturday at 3 o'clock on the dot, don't be late. I'll be there at 2. And I'll be ready at 1. And I hear music all the time.. It's charming, it's disturbing, intoxicating. It has a magical effect to find music in one's hear Jean, put my bags in the car.

We're off to the Riviera! We're going! - You met him? What's he like? - He's a sweetheart! I never thought a petty accountant could be so elegant. - So tell me about it. - Well, I turned up... My trip has fallen through, Rosalie. And why don't you go, Mr Biscotte? I don't have tyres or petrol. Where's my hat? - Your hat? - Yes, my hat. I can't go out without a hat! Give me my hat.

Isn't it delightful? Splendid! A magnificent car. Can I sit in it? Any time. When will you be leaving, Mr Biscotte? I'm not going anymore. Mr Biscotte, you're wanted on the phone. What? I'm coming. Yes, Rosalie, it's me. A messenger with a registered letter? 3,000... for me? Who's the sender? Gibet? My dear, I can go anyway! This Gibet can't accompany me, so he sends me something so i can go alone. We're leaving, my pet. Listen, Rosalie. Lock the doors. Don't let the messenger leave under any circumstances. And get the suitcase down and close everything. No, not the doors... the suitcase. Wait there, I'll be right back! - Look, leave me alone! - How jumpy you are today. You don't know what it is, to take a big trip by car. Two o'clock. There he is! Mr Biscotte, I'm coming. Panapou... Help me. - You're leaving already? - He's there. - He looks an important guy! - No, he's a petty accountant. Here is a beautiful necklace. And another one. - That's all? - Yes. Hurry up! Listen as soon as we get there I'll send you a long letter. So you'd best give me some stamps. - Hello there, how are you? - Well thank you. Is this the car you won in a raffle? Yes. You can see I was pretty lucky, eh? Oh, you can say that again! Hop in. Hell of a lot nice than a bus! Sure is! Josephine, bring it all here. - What's this? - The tyres, as agreed.

Rosalie, you don't seem to understand... I'm going to Cannes, down south... sub tropical. I'm dressed for the occasion. You understand? Come on, step back. You haven't seen anything yet! To the lucky lottery winner BON VOYAGE! Smile, please!. Smile! Look a bit more sporty, Mr Biscotte. Very good... Hold it...! Here, keep that from me as a souvenir. The editor's going to be happy. Goodbye, Mr Biscotte! Yes, I'm off to everywhere and nowhere at all Yes I'm off to happiness and chance I'm on my way Farewell to every dark concern So everything now is only good Yes, I'm off to everywhere and nowhere at all Where are we going? To the hotel, to have something to eat. In such a fancy hotel? But I'm hungry. We have to watch what we spend. We will go to a more modest place later. I'm the one who holds the purse strings! Come on, get out. You really want to stop here? But this all you need, Mister Accountant! Alright. Go on, scram! Get the hell out! Cheat! Scoundrel! Bugger off! I'm boss in this place! And I want peace, goddammit! Good evening. - What's the name of your inn? - Can't you read?! "Au Bon vigneron" Are you the good vigneron? Who would you think it is? Damn me if it's not a dumb question! Lovely little doggie! But please come in. You're most welcome. Charming... What do you know about politics. Nothing at all Whadda you mean I know nothing?! What would you like? Give us something first-rate to eat. Here you can have anything you want. I recommend these. Oh no, we never eat them. What do you mean? You wanted to eat here. Come on...

How far are we from the next petrol station? About twenty kilometres. How far?! 20 kilometres! Or so, old chap. I can offer you a large room. With a wonderful, comfortable bed for two people. Unfortunately, we're not married. Pity. The room is always enjoyed by couples... ...both the legal ones and the others. But we aren't "others" either. That's a shame. Put dinner on the bill. I'll pay it all in the morning. That sound like you ARE married Lulu! Yes. What is it? That guy and his wife are sleeping separately. What?! Believe me, they want separate rooms. Go now and prepare the attic room for them. Separate bedrooms... That's shameful! Disgusting! All it does is give me extra work. I'm fed up with these Parisian pigs! Slaving away all the time I'm tired of working like this. Never eating. Never sleeping. Who invented tourists?! I think I'll go look for a job in Paris Paris. That's surely the best thing I can do. Here's your room. - Good night, Miss Jacqueline. - Goodnight. - Pleasant dreams. - Thank you. Tell me... Shall we be eating bacon omelet again tomorrow? No. Tomorrow I'll allow you something else.

After which, you'll take the Mercedes... ...and you'll find me on the road to Lyon, at Grenoble. Very good, Sir. I'm not alone. I'm travelling with a lady. You'll introduce yourself as if you were Mr Benoit, banker. One of my best friends. And you'll invite us both to eat, the lady and I. The lady and I... Very good, Sir. And I'm not Lord Kingsdale to you. From now on, I'm Mr Biscotte to you. - Understood? - Very good, Sir. That's all... Now off you go and be quick about it! ...and be quick about it! Hands up! I adore you! Oh sorry, I made a mistake. Who did you want? Miss Jacqueline Pascaud. She's gone on a trip. - Since when? - Since yesterday. - Where's she gone? - To Monte-Carlo. - How? - By car.

If the road is rough, we bounce at every bump. A motor car, a motor car, I know nothing that's more grand. It's charming, exciting, it's really a delight. Enjoy the thrill, that it gives, when your doing over a ton! Two out in a motor car, that is what I need. A motor car, a motor car, I know nothing that's more grand. And that's not all... There's more to come. - Bravo! - Wonderful! My friends, what can I offer you? Grapes, melon, pineapple, figs, peaches, candied fruit... ...bananas, oranges, choc-ice, acid drops, mints... I'd like an orange and a banana. Your friend Benoit is delightful. Oh yes. - How lucky to have met him. - It was, wasn't it. And we save so much with him inviting us to eat. Of course, I prefer lobster and caviar, to a cheese omelet. So do I, when we're not paying for it. Of course. Joseph, give me a cigar! Really! My dear friend Joseph Benoit, please give me a cigar! With pleasure, my dear Biscotte! This is Radio Paris. The latest morning news... Yesterday in Dijon the 50th birthday of Mr Imac was celebrated.

Please don't read, while I'm so miserable! - When do we reach Cannes? - In 2 hours. 2 hours?! What did I do to the good Lord to be a martyr on this earth? Must you read that book?!

My hopes arose throughout the warm, soft evening I let myself be surprised and that's since I believe in you. But without offending you, here is how I truly feel In secret I'll whisper... you can't ever hurt me. I want to put my heart in your white hands. There's no better shelter, my dear, here is my heart. When you come to look right down upon me.. If longing for pleasure, you want to make me suffer. Tonight I want to dream forth a lovely poem All I want from you, my dear, is love. For me, my dear, it would be supreme joy. I want to put my heart in your little hands. Well, Miss Jacqueline, what are you dreaming about? It's such a wonderful country. And everything is so cheap here. Come to see. What's this all about? Just a little surprise for you. A little surprise? But this must have cost an arm and a leg. These dresses would be thousands of francs. No, all second-hand. 100 francs each. - What about the silver-fox? - No, it's alley-cat. How much would that be in your shop? I don't know, I only sell gramophone records. I don't know where I am, any more. My head's spinning. - I'll never be able to account for it. - So much the better. Oh you...! - And this ring? - It's a good imitation, isn't it? It's pretty. A simple piece of cut glass. Looks like a real diamond. See you later, at dinner. You'll wear that dress? OK? Whats the number of my suite? Number 120, Sir. I ordered a superb beach robe for you today, Joseph. - It's worthy of my new friend Benoit. - Thank you sir. - Where should I go to get it? - It'll be delivered here. - And my new name: Mr Biscotte. - Yes, Mr Biscotte. Sorry, thank you Sir. Biscotte! Wake up! Listen... I just want a small room. You put me in a big room, and don't listen to me, when... That's not the question. What are you doing here? Me? Nothing yet. I just got here... And would you be so good as to leave immediately. Leave... why? You don't have a small room. It's not a question of a small room. Listen, I'll give you 5000 francs if you leave immediately. Why? We know each other! How are you? I've no time to answer you! Listen, I'll give you 10,000 francs, if you leave right away. OK? We are not so well acquainted... ...that I can allow you to joke at my expense. - I'm just waiting for my small room. - But this is not a joke. It's not about a room. Biscotte, I'll give you 20,000 francs, if you leave now. 20,000? I'll take it! - Listen... no... I can't. - Go! Take it! - No, it's too much. - Take it! It's too much. I can't.

I'm leaving. - Where are you going, Mr Biscotte? - I'm leaving. - But why? - I don't know. Someone gave me 3,000 francs to come here. And now I've been given 20,000 francs to leave.

Could I have Mr Biscotte's room, please. Hello? What is it? What? Sorry, Sir, must be a wrong number. Miss, would you put me through to Mr Anatole Biscotte. What's this again?! Where the hell did I put my suspenders? I don't care about your suspenders, Sir. Listen, Miss, you've connected me to the wrong number, twice now. Would you please tell Mr Biscotte that I'll meet him in the garden. Thank you. What is it, now? A lady? In the garden? For me? Tell her I'm sorry, but she may have to wait a few minutes. I can't come down, before I've found my... There they are! I've found them! I'll come right away. Bellboy, would you please check if Mr Biscotte is still in his room. Here I am. Biscotte. This is me, in person. No, I'm waiting for Mr Anatole Biscotte. But actually, Miss.... I am actually Anatole Biscotte, accountant. What? Your name is Anatole Biscotte, also? And you're also an accountant? Here's my photograph in Omnia. And you also won a car? Why do you keep saying "also"? I'm the only Anatole Biscotte, accountant. The only one who won a car. So the other one then? What about the other one? That's the the Rosengart. No, I mean the other man. You mean the spitting Spaniard? No, the one with whom I... How do I know with whom you have...? Sir, it's intermission... I'll just be 5 minutes.... No, not just yet. Tango. Sir... Are you sure your name is Biscotte? Has been for 40 years and 5 months. So, there's another gentleman named Biscotte... ...who also won a car, who's also an accountant. - Who also works for Chamorel and Co? - That's right. It's amazing! He's an imposter, a schemer! Show him to me... I want to see him! Where is he? Where are we? Where are you? There he is! ...under another's name. That's not on! He's taken my name! The thief! I'll give him a piece of my mind! - Stay here! - No... Yes, I'll stay. I'll do the talking. I've a good mind to throw his 20,000 francs in his face! No. I'll contain myself... and keep my dignity. Ans where have you been all this time? Trying on my dresses. Looking at all your little surprises. All your second-hand things. - Happy with them all? - Very. Particularly the bathing costume... Chosen with great taste. But of course you'd be used to it. Why? Chamorel and Company. Hosiery wholesalers. Yes, that's right of course. By the way, do you sell any good-quality tights at your firm? Good tights... Yes, one of our specialties. - How much do you sell them for? - How much do we... Oh... We have very good ones... Very inexpensive, from 2,000 francs. What?! We also have some from 1,000 francs. Are they hard-wearing? Yes, very very hard-wearing. You can pull them all you want, they're triple thickness. Tights in boiled leather? Chamorel and Co is a tannery. Miss Jacqueline, I don't know what good-quality tights are. So you deceived me? You're not an accountant. And your name is not Biscotte. So who are you? Please, don't be mad at me. Just answer me. Who are you?. Yes... but you won't be angry? I am Lord Harry Kingsdale. Don't be angry. Are you angry? No. - Mr Biscotte, I know who he is. - Who? - Must be upper class. - Yes. A count... a duke... - A prince... - No, a lord. Why not grand duke or emperor while he was about it? You think he's still lying to me? My poor child, we're in Cannes, in the roses and con-men season. Where are you going? Why are you running? Wait for me! Porter, do you know Lord Kingsdale? Yes, Madam. - Is he staying in the hotel? - No, Madam. - He's not here? - No, Madam. - But he's in Cannes! - No, Madam! I told you! So who is that man over there talking to the head waiter? That's a Mr Biscotte from Paris. It's like banging my head against a wall! Come on, Miss, don't let it upset you. To be lied to... deceived... by HIM! One must be very careful getting into such relations. But all I was asking for was a few days holiday in the sun! And now... now... Now let me give you some good advice. Come back to Paris with me. Yes, you're right. It may be the best thing to do. When will we leave? Meet me at 9.30 at the garage? Yes. I'll be there. Sir, it's intermission... I'd like to... Later! We'll go together. Slow waltz. What is it? It's me, Jacqueline. I've arranged a little supper for us downstairs. Yes, I'll be right down. - I'll wait for you in the dining-room. - Yes, I'm coming. Let me get this straight... You're registering with us a sum of 20,000 francs that you got from some fellow... No, he's not "some fellow", Inspector... He's a gentleman. A very likeable gentleman. And it's only because I am of scrupulous integrity... In short, you don't want to keep this money... Yes, I want to keep it. Only my integrity... That's fine... And you're registering a complaint? I'm not registering a complaint. I'm registering the 20,000 francs And if I may be so bold, I suggest you arrest him quickly. But to arrest him, we have to find him first. That's easy. Even I could find him. - Here's your party, Inspector. - Thank you. Hello? Grand Hotel? Duval, the porter? This is Police Inspector Tremois. Could you tell me who is staying in Suite 120? Suite 120? Well, Inspector... Officially, it's a Mr Biscotte. But actually, and in confidence... ...it's one of our oldest clients, Lord Kingsdale... ...who has adopted an alias on account of a young lady. Yes, yes... I quite understand. Thank you. Well, now I've got the picture. You're going to arrest him? Of course. - Today? - Sure! Forgive me Inspector... ...but I'm interested as to how you'll catch him... ..as there are 8 ways out of the hotel. We'll send 12 officers to cover each exit! So that makes 8x12, equals 96... 96 plus 20,000 equals... - Take back your 20,000 francs. - No, I won't touch that money. I take responsibility. No, that money would burn my fingers. - Very well...! - Stop! Please speak to me politely, Sir. My name is Biscotte. And please put on file... ...that the police have obliged me to look after that money. - Where's the way out? - Through there, Sir. - What is it? - Miss Jacqueline, open quickly! I need to talk to you urgently. They're going to arrest him. - Who? - Lord Biscotte. The hotel will be surrounded by police. 12 officers to each exit. That makes 20,000 officers. - 20,000?! - 47... er 96... - But what will we do? - We'll fill up on petrol... ...slip around the corner and disappear. I'll meet you at... - At the garage, I know. - Oh, my head! - Hurry up! - Yes, I'll be right down. Intermission. - Hey, Sir! - Oh no! Not the "spitting Spaniard!?" Where's Jacqueline? In my care. She's leaving for Paris with me. - She's not to go! - She'll go! - No. she won't go! - She WILL go! - No. No...! - Yes! Yes! Hello, Miss Jacqueline. What is it?! You want to go out? No way. We're leaving. You're being arrested. Me? Why? Don't play innocent. The porter told me. You're no lord. So who am I? I don't care. But you have to flee now. The two of us? Leave together? That's wonderful! Boy! My hat, quickly! - Where are we going? - No matter. Just come! Together... wonderful! Let's scram! Leave that alone! - You're not leaving! - I AM leaving! My finger! Imbecile! It's not loaded. Now you're getting me mad! - You know... - What? Stop them! Stop them! My car! Get out of my car! Give me back my car! Stop! Let go of it! Let go of the wheel! ...or I'll let you have it! Look to see if we're being followed. Yes! I see two headlights. Sure to be the police. Let go! We have to get ahead of them. We'll head for the forest... ...and we'll "give them the slip", as we bandits say. And now, if you'd like to step out. - Are we going to stay here? - Why not? It's a wonderful spot. Look at all the trees... and so quiet. The weather's good now. But my coat is all wet. My top-hat is sodden. You are a scary man... You're even happy! My heart is thumping... I'm afraid... No... why do you need to be afraid? I'll fix you up with a wonderful bedroom. Two handles ... One bed. What a wonderful invention. Good, eh? Now you'll change out of that damp dress. I'll give you some dry pyjamas. Put them on while I have a look around the forest. It's getting cold...! And black as the ace of spades. Get out! You're never satisfied. Where are we now? Look out! It's a cliff! Wait. I think I have some matches. Mr Biscotte, you saved my life! I didn't mean to Are you comfortable, Miss Jacqueline? Very! And you? Fine as far as width goes. Lengthwise, it's a bit short. Wait... I have an idea. There... you can come in the back. - Me? - Yes. What's this? This is my idea... A small partition. - Good night. - Good night. Dear God... send me an earthquake. Beddy-byes... Beddy-byes... Colin my little brother... - What are you doing? - Taking my shoes off. Sleepy-byes, you'll get some cake. There it is! I see it! - Where? - There! - Where? - There! - I see nothing. - There! Yes, I see it! Thug! ... 62 francs 50! What's going on? Get dressed quickly. The police are after us. Go on... gently... Keep going... Stop! - Hold on tight! - I'm holding on. - Don't let go! - I'm not letting go. I'm holding on. Milord. May I present... Lady Kingsdale. Watch out! And when I say "release the brake", you step on the gas... ...and you reverse. Watch out! Put it in reverse! Step on the gas! Release the brake! I said put it in reverse... Imbecile! Thug! Moron! I dare you say that to my face! Fin Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
