Thenmala, Kerala-Tamilnadu boarder region. Why do people talk? To say it in simple terms, to make others understand what is inside. But, does anyone think about intention and goal of talking? When someone talks to others? The right things at right time we often forget to talk. Haven't you given this even now? Scared man! But, in the times when it is not at all required. Un necessary we speak about lot of things. All this must be questioned. Look, when the night falls to turn on these street lights. Can the Panchayat do anything on that regard? I thought now only, there is an urgent meeting of standing committee. To some, there is no problem on talking to any one seen or heard. Tell man. But to talk to family and relatives there will be no time at all. All this I have told you, is it not? Do one thing, I'll come there okay then. There are some other kinds of people who keeps on talking non stop. Still, in front of this? Since I'm unaware, I'm asking you. What is your thought? Study decently, secure a good job. Don't do all this! What to talk? How to talk? When to talk? When not to talk. Without knowing all this what all problems are created on each day. I'm delivering is it? You wait. Why man talking in English, I even don't know Tamil, then why English? The problems because of the tongue in the mouth. When it will be over? Perhaps when not being able to speak opening the mouth, at least. Will the problems of human beings find an end? 'Talking harmful to heath' "Never talk all this things" "And make it a talk of the town" "On touching the heart Again can the singing be done silently?" "Never sing what ever you see, as a song" "Slowly you don't close the mouth again" "Hey shut up! Close the mouth, no talking" "Hey shut up! Close the mouth, no talking" Talking is injurious to health. "Hey shut up! Close the mouth, no talking" It's shut up! "Hey shut up! Close the mouth, no talking" Talking is injurious to health. Will you be silent? My concentration is going. Tell, something fellow! How come he is not saying anything? Not dance man, its chicken. "Whatever that is seen on the by gone paths" "You don't come later and say all that" "With the stories you don't have to go anywhere" Hey man, how long have been asking? "On hearing all this ears don't just nod as dumb" "On touching the heart Can the singing be done silently?" My concentration is going. Bravo! Great! "Hey shut up! Close the mouth, no talking" Today, we have with us. To make the orange more colorful, tasteful. Cochin's Jaan! My name is Sh..Aa..N. Shaan, ever before have you come to Thenmala? How is our native?

So like that Thenmala, has also liked Shaan very much. Shaan, is keeping on coughing. To get rid off Shaan's cough, I'm going to give a real hot coffee to Shaan. Till then we will take a small break. What you are listening is Orange F.M Cochin's own Jaan! Madam, must bless me. Who are you? What is it? On waking up today morning whose face have you seen first? Why to know all that? Simply, tell madam. My daughter's. That is why, that is why, like this. Like what? Even othenlvise will I feel like to... ...come to this house alone, with such a great product like this? Mr. Fix it. Let it be torn or broken be it paper, rubber, plastic, glass. Cloth or money. Whatever it may be. Anything it is. A baloon like this when poking like this, will blast making a sound. When a drop of Mr. Fix it, is applied. On blowing again. Baloon is blown up again as ajack fruit, can't you see it? From the pipe which has a hole to broken heart. It is a wonder glue which can be sticked. Mr. Fix it. No need, here it is not required. Madam, it is not like ordinary glue. Shall I show a small demo? 5 minutes will finish it fast. No need, there is no time that is why. Madam, madam, one minute. What had happened to child's Barbie? Oh! That is an old one. Should throw that and buy a new one. It's not like that, daughter has got a special liking towards that doll. Can brother mend your doll? No need of all that. Don't be afraid madam, you don't buy this. If anything that is seen faulty. If it's not mended out, I'll not get peace of mind. That is why. Not that, what did you say what all can be glued with this? What happened Shaan? Coughing real hard. Is there fever? While waking up in the morning there was no problem. While coming from the hotel, throat... I think it is because of climate. I don't want tea or coffee. Bring one glass of hot water to the studio. Is there any amplifier fitted on your mouth? Will shout. I'll again shout, let the entire compatriots know it. What is it? My name is Aravind. So what? Hey lady, who is that? What is it to you?

What is the dealing between you two? Dealings? Brother don't say by God's forbid. By looking at this sister's face can anything like that felt to say? Hey fellow, what is wrong with my face? Tell, you fellow what is wrong with my face? Understood. What did you understand? Understood what is the problem between you two. Brother, never used to say a good word about sister. Is it not true? For that she... Brother, let me say. And sister will not let the brother to move freely. Too much of controlling. For that he sits always on my head, 24 hours. Let m e say. When one person talks other person is not listening to it. Then how can it be corrected? Only if a gap is given to talk, only then brother can say good about sister. Only on feeling when love and affection is there. Sister can obey to what brother says. When one person lowers a bit these problems are only that much. Even othenlvise I know. I'm the one who should always lower and to be defeated always. I know I should be lowered and defeated at all times. This is all not an issue at all brother. Just tell sister as I tell you. With this song we will wind up the show. Shaan's throat is getting strained a lot. No... Again one more is there, no. Look. For the last one week it was a big quarrel over there. What did you do? Did you glue their mouths? Not in the mouth, here. Madam, didn't I say I'll stick even the broken hearts? Since knowing to talk well, good. I really like to talk.

What is spread across Thenmala. To explain on un identified disease. Respected health minister Sri. Prabakaran Thachapuzha. Had called for a press meet. Now can see the live telecast of press meet. In the district of Idukki, at the region of Thenmala. A disease named dumb flue. Is widely seen. It has been proved, after the examinations. Those who are effected with this disease. The ability to talk. The chances to lose the talking ability are high. That has been found out, by this time. Those who are infected only in the tongue. Their sound will not be lost. But slowly, there are chances that the virus may effect the sound pipes also. If it happens like that, the sound faculty is lost. Virus from the tongue. What is this? Vocal cord. Hey man, can't you write it in Malayalam? To spread it to the vocal chord. The time for that is dependent on the individuals, preventive power. Sneezing, throat pain, sudden swelling in the tongue. Getting dried, cough, itching. Those who find the symptoms. Must succumb to examination immediately. Including at the preliminary health centers. For this, all the arrangements are being done. It is only from Thenmala. Such reports of this disease is obtained so far. As this disease is not seen in other parts of Kerala. Till more information is received, no one is allowed... ...to go out from Thenmala. Then is it confirmed it is contagious? Now, only like a climate prediction anything can be told. May or may not be contagious, there are chances. In the case as told, no should leave the Thenmala. You might be around here, is it not? No, no I'll go. No, we can't go. You go and tell that at Mapranam. Wife's sister is there, no. Sini Mol. Sunday it's her marriage. If I don't go, then Ratnama, will chop below my waist. Journalists, T.\/. Camera. As the noble language status declaration is completed. Aren't there any Malayalam name given for the disease? If it is that necessary. Write it as 'Ooma pani' (fever that creates dumbness) Yes, Ooma Pam. Whose face did you see first? On waking up in the morning. MC Movie Channel Hey man. They are putting some thing in the nose and checking. Dude, it's some big disease. All that will not affect us. Simply bringing me here. Who was sleeping in the house. Are you haPPV7 Anjana, crowd is high. You also go with junior doctors and take the patienfs test. What you told is true. Coming here is good. Not good, really good. Blow it on this. Is it the nose? For me the paper is allergic. This is only to clean the nose. If you have the hand-kerchief with you. Can use that one. Not in hand. Can you adjust one and give? What? If it is the shawl of this Churidar, that will be also fine. Tilt the head backwards. Should not move. Does the result of this be obtained fast? Look. That will take few days. Will you sit without moving? Buddy, that item is good is it not? It's okay. It's my mistake. As a doctor I should have taken attention. It is all right, doctor. Any way, it was not blood test, luckily. Doctor, didn't say your name? Anjana. My name is Aravind. Shall I leave? Wanted to say a thing, planning to say for time. Janakiamma, had told that son must not be intimated with all this matters. Brother, tell the matter. The owner of this building where the orphanage is remaining. Tam pi Durai. He raised our rent all of a sudden. On telling, will see whether with you can be negotiated. Janakiam ma, is not listening to that. Why is that? May be on thinking what is there simply hearing from the mouth of that, Tam pi Durai, you shouldn't be made to hear. In my mouth also, there is tongue only. Any way let me go and meet him. Aravind. Brother are you here now? For some time, I'm here only. How come you are here? Came to meet Tam pi, sir. Our orphanage is there, no? Came to discuss a matter on that. Is it regarding the issue of that building? That mother from there, came 4 to 5 times. There is no sign of any solution. May be on talking once again. Rather than telling Tam pi sir. You go and tell in the back side of some buffaloes. On touching the sound, at least it will move it tail. Is he that much problematic? Sir, I came asking for a small help? Not possible. For that, I didn't even ask. If any one comes for help. Always, I'll say not possible only. I came to speak about the orphanage. Do you know the value of that building? Sir, the rent, first you told. It was given regularly, is it not? Without any prior notice, if you increase the rent like this? It is my wish, increasing or decreasing the rent. That is my prOPEITV- You don't have to command anything. Sir, this is also a service is it not? What? Service? To do the service, am 'I running a trust? If you have that much love, you pay the rent. Sir, please listen what I say. You don't say anything, vacate the place. Sir, only one minute, one minute only. Must listen to what I say. Okay, tell. Looks like sirs mood is not that good. My bum and all are lying here only. Sir, you must come to our orphanage, one day. On seeing the happiness of the children over there. In any man's mind, there will be a smile. I won't smile. That is because sir is angry now, is it not? Hey Man, always I won't smile. What should I do, to change sifs mood? Who is this fellow? Can't you understand anything? I won't smile, man. But still, is there people like this? 4 to 5 years back, his son went and married an outside caste girl. After that, it is heard that this tough nut attitude. Both of them, had not smiled after that. What's the issue in marrying? As there was only one, was really lulled. When son did an inter-caste marriage, it was a big blow on their prestige. On that mind frame, the son was chucked out also. Then? Then what? That boy and girl they are living lavishly. They are here with a stiff face. How can you see these fellows for 2.5 hours? Lot of fans to praise, stupid fellows like this. Will you change this filth? Don't change. It's climax. As the ban is still prevailing. As the shooting is stopped. The actor Boomesh is in a situation. Not being able to go back to Cochin. The agitators against the movies of Boomesh. The members of all Kerala drunkards association. The ones who had come in support of Boomesh. The fans associations. By this, they are trapped in Thenmala. Just because of Boomesh, drunkards like us... ...who are decently hailed. Created a bad name on us. There is only one way to remove that. In the next movie he should act as a drunkard. Like that, people like us should be shown as decent fellows. Can you explain it? You are the President. That means, hero getting really drunk. Along with father and mother, singing hardcore sentimental songs. If the heroine is to love hero. Then the hero coming in a drunken condition like this. The hero must say I love you. There is lot of staring in that. Who are these fellows to decide which role brother Boomen should do? It is not necessary for brother Boomen to hear what they say. Brother Boomen never used to hear what the director says. Then, after all this drunkards. Of lately there are no reasons for strikes and all. If I were there. Within 5 minutes. All this issues would be solved. Buddy, has the result of the test come? No. Told will inform on reaching. Do you have any throat pain, itching? I just took that test for a safety, that's all. Lot of dust. Time has come to clean the room. Okay then, shall I leave? Man, little work is there man? Work, what work? Came here on telling, feeling bored by sitting there. Now only thought, one or two programs are there. I'll go and come. Hey man, don't take the course. You are fleeing, due to the fear you will catch dumb flu is it not? For that you don't have flu is it? Only when I sneezed, for you work and all emerged. Hey man, got work to do. Stop it man, stop coughing. Stop it, don't sneeze. Hey man, this is not a contagious disease. Through genes only, this is.. Go man, go! One filth, you say it as" Two man! My ear will be faulty! Okay you sit here. I'll go and check whether my result is ready. On getting that, all your doubt will be over, is it not? What man? Nothing sir. Satish. Satish. Present miss. Will call now for the test, can wait here. "Dear companion" Can any of the duty doctors be met? Really busy, doesn't think they can be met. If it's for tomorrow, the appointment can be done. Are you free? I, was about to leave. It was for me to ask a small doubt. Come inside. There is some difference on doctor, than seen last time. What difference? Nothing, have you changed the frame of specs? This is new one. This is very stylish. Really suits you. Didn't ask the doubt. That is because, I'm a person who is living with door to door sale and all. Now on seeing any strangers. The house keepers are closing the door. On account of that no business is taking place. Truly is this dumb fever contagious? For that it is not known, whether Aravind, has got the disease. Then why thinking about being contagious? Still now it is not discovered through the sneeze the disease is transmitted. The research and all is going on. On saying all this will the people understand all this? Half is blown up by these people. For few days this fear and all will be there. After that it will be over. Normally what everyone does is. On going out will wear the lens. On going home that will be removed. Why is it, other way round? I don't like to wear lens. Glass is comfortable. Then why did you wear lens now? That is because for some, they don't like, I wearing glass. That is for whom? Generally it is the girls who are strict on boyfriends. Here is it the other way round? Here, no one is standing and drawing. I didn't mean that. Just for a joke. Anything else? No. I must go now. MC Movie Channel Are they lolly-pops? Is it available even now? Not that easy to get, sister. It is from the shop of my friend. His grandmother makes at home. Only old memories of olden days having one, are there. Has been years on seeing. Here. No need, I just told causally. No problem sister, give one to daughter. She might not have eaten all this. Here Are there lolly-pops in here? Lolly-pops, what are those?

The medicine is made available at preliminary health centers, ...hospitals and medical shops. Still now no one's death is reported, affected with dumb flu. If anything happens like that. That will be firstly informed to you, by Prime T.V news only. Hey man, what you told is completely forgotten. It is not 2 page dialogue that is written, is it? To forget so fast. To say that much dialogue, it's bit hard. Then shall I say simple 2 dialogues? Then you go. Hey man will the Indu, cheat? That is Ciiandu. This is ind... Go boldly. I'll be there outside. MC Movie Channel Sadeesha, smiling, has not forgotten. What to say after writing the bill? My God, ruined! Say something and all man. No, can't hear anything. What man? What happened? Stretch out the tongue. Has it spread from me, doctor'? So you are also having this disease, is it? Still now not found out it is contagious. To know whether you have that disease also. The result of the test should reach. Doctor is there any way to find before that? Will know. When the sound stops. To participate in the discussion on dumb flu. Respected health department minister. Prabakaran Thachapuzha. Ex-minister and opposition M.L.A. Thomas Kuzhiveli. They are both here with us, over the telephone line. Greetings Prabakaran Thachapuzha. Greetings, greetings. The actual checking of disease is not happening at Thenmala. The actual news of the disease is not obtained. Hiding from the people. Like that several allegations are coming up... magainst the health department. How do you react to these allegations? All that is simply told and created by opposition. You go and see that Thenmala hospital. People are flocking like anything. It is a huge response. In such an irresponsible way, can a minister talk? Who is ruling the state of Kerala? To conceal the clash in the ministry. I doubt this disease is created by the ruling party itself. Generally these kind of diseases, only the central ministry... ...is powered to launch all this. Thomachayan, has got no knowledge on that. The person who is knowledgeable on that. Did you conduct an awareness on that? Who told did not conduct an awareness? 2 times awareness was created. Even after telling, when people are not listening. Then what to do? Buy banana, can peel off the skin and can put it in the mouth. But to swallow they must intend is it not? Did you hear? Is this a dialogue fit for a minister in Kerala? Will a cultured person talk like this? Calling people banana swallowers! Thachapuzha must resign. No, no I've not told like that. Making goat in to a dog. This is the routine practice of Kuzhiveli. Go man! I will resign now. Never, it will happen. That is a good one. Sri. Prabakaran Thachapuzha, yet there is an im portant another question. Still now the government has not accepted dumb flu is contagious. Then why did the health department distribute... mthousands of masks to the people? That is because" If at all if it were to spread. What would you do? Is it better to prevent the disease? Than after it's spread and crying on it. I will tell the matter on that. On the pretext of that mask. Crores of rupees of corruption has taken place. After collecting commission from the mask manufactures. Thachapuzha, has conducted a masked robbery. How do you react Prabakaran Thachapuzha? On allegations made by Thomas Kuzhiveli. That is a big joke. Hallo, hallo. Can't hear. Can't hear. Hallo, don't leave him. Don't allow to escape. How will a minister rule the country? On becoming confused when accused. Can't hear. Me resigning now, no way! Will have to taste sour for that! "You go and see that Thenmala hospital" "People are flocking like anything. It is a huge response" "It is a huge response" "His grandmother's camera" "Me resigning now, no way!" "Will have to taste sour for that!" Why sir, standing up side down? On eating this 'bringo di fringafath', it is said that... ...good ideas will come to head. That is for people who has got something in heads. That is a good 'Aasanam',(yoga posture) sir. You have got the best 'aasanam'. Please get up. Really heavy! My sir, do you know one thing? Like the month of 'kanni' dogs cry, that is how the phone is ringing. I got fed up by answering. On tuning on T.V there is only sir. And in the net, there is no need to mention. With one interview have I made an impact? Sir, not an impact..Calling father! On the face book, youths are defaming. Except that Prime T.V all other channels are slightly in bad humor. Why is that? Because of sifs one interview. The rating of Prime T.V escalated to rocket height. It seems no one is watching comedy programs. They are asking, to other channels also. Can you say such kinds of foolishness? Hey man, what is the way to avoid un necessary... ...things coming from the mouth? Like putting speed locks for vehicles. Shall we put a lock in sir's mouth? The dumb flu, that is spread in Thenmala. Is taking a decisive turn now. This disease is spread by H1 0, N1 0 viruses. The name which was termed as 'dumb flu' by health minister. Prabakaran Thachapuzha, is now affected with this disease. It is found that ministefs talking ability is fully lost. That is what is found from the reliable sources now. Move back. He is sick, move back. Believed, believed, all those fools were duped! Not that, did you stuff some thing in that doctor's pocket? Not only in his pocket, even inside his underwear... ...lumps of notes are stuffed. That's enough, that's enough. Can we trust him? Who? That fellow? If he says anything, will whack even his deep rooted parts. Now there is no need to convince anything to anyone. That is enough. But still, sir's idea is astonishing. That is because this Thacha... It's C.M! No, tell I'm not here. I'm not here. Okay sir. Told to put it in the speaker phone. Sir, this is Sasi. Where has Thachapuzha, gone? Pachathuzha...Sir! Machatha..He is here sir. Hey man, Thachapuzha! He is hearing, continue talking. Can't talk, on opening the mouth only air will come from the throat. Can't sit here, because of pressure from media and opposition. What should I do? Sashi, what is that fellow doing? That is scratching his head, sir. Sir, telling to keep quite. No, sir telling me to keep quite. Should I hand over the responsibility of your... ...portfolio to some else? Sir, showing bye, bye. What? My heavens, sir, not that. Sir, showing no need, no need. Sir, one minute writing some thing, let me check what it is. Not need to remove from responsibilities. It is said, I myself will handle that. Okay, okay, let me study the situation. Tell, never step in to the channel. Though can't talk, he will show actions with hand, ...like Kadakali and all. Sir, he is showing. No, not that coming there to meet you sir. Sir, coming to meet you. With the fever and all don't come here. Till the sickness gets over, let him sit there only. Okay sir. Is it Sree Devi Madam? Yes. This is Adityan's class teacher speaking from Nirmalagiri school. Called to inform a complaint about Adityan. Today while the class was going on. He was sitting in the last bench and playing video games. Video game? How did he get the video game in the class? That is brought from the house. On asking told, brought from home. If you don't attend more in child's affairs. That will create un easiness for us. Nothing like that will happen again. On reaching here, immediately I'll ask. Adityan, is very much distracted in the class. Always his attention is somewhere else. Will be problem if the improvement is not shown. MC Movie Channel Why are you waiting here? Came to collect the result. For that can go to the counter and ask. A fear. Come. Do you like that much to talk? I have not told, haven't I? My biggest ambition is to become an R.J. Even otherwise all this years after saying what ever felt. All of a sudden can't talk, means. Can doctor be able to do that? When people keeps quite for some time. Half of the problem will be solved. They will remain peaceful, attending their lobs. In life there are some problems. Is it not true? All this problems in the mind can be solved by talking only. Can I ask one thing? What we think and talk, is it not by using head? When the brain is remaining silent there, which is taking... ...all the work of thinking. Why is that our heart is beating there? To pump blood. No, that is talking to us non stop. Only the thing no one used to attend on that. Without listening to what brain says. Just obey to what heart says. Then all our problems will be solved. The result of the test is positive. These are the medicines which have to be taken daily. They are for three weeks. Then after every two day, should come and take a injection. To completely cure the disease, it is said that inventions are going on. The researchers are taking place on big scale. Till then to control the virus only this injection and tablet. At any cost, it should not be discontinued. There is no big medicine greater than self confidence for any disease. Where are all this things being taken? That is..The expenses are going up. Like before none of the funds are coming, son. Did that Tam pi Du rai again create problem? If you don't tell me. Thought I won't know is it? Other day, I went and begged by catching his leg. Who told you to talk to him? Then what? Can't I talk? Don't inform me anything. If I give some money. Reluctance to accept it. Hey fellow, aren't you doing, more than what you can now? If it was informed earlier, I would have arranged some money from somewhere. Hey boy! What is this? What had happened to you? Because of this dumb flu, sales are not happening also. Othenlvise would have found out some other way. Is it because of your fault, all this occurred? Some things if we try that will happen. Some things how much we try, that will go in it's own course. How will we know which will work and which will not work... ...on trying? Good, if it works or not. Should do only the things that is right for the mind. On doing like that, a kind of pleasure is received is it not? On gaining what so ever, that will not be achieved. There is no big medicine greater than self confidence for any disease. You can call me to say anything. From inside it says Jai Hind. On saying the name, it's Aravind. MC Movie Channel Can't understand. Is it to meet E.N.T specialist? Come I'll show you. This is the one. Next time if you come here. If you want any help, can meet me. The name is Indu. The name is Satish, is it not? I remember that. The other day on calling the name. Like the school children, haven't you told present miss? Noticed at that time. It is for the first time a girl is talking to you, smilingly. Generally, every one will lure girls by talking. Looks like when you keep quite only, things will fall in it's place. Looks like the thing is through. Give the hand! Since this fever has evolved, the entire business is dull. When going for a sale, no one will open the door itself. Because of that, now telling the acquaintances. If the business doesn't crack, the salary will be cut. If it doesn't trouble you, can I come home? On seeing the demo, if you like it only buy it. Otherwise no need. Has gone out, who is it? My name is Aravind, wanted to show a demo of a product. I was told to come. Has not told anything. Left little while ago. Don't know when is the return. Madam, can I show the demo of some products? Only home based products if you like it, only buy it. Now there is cricket on T.V, are you not seeing it? Told, not to watch T.\/. Why is that? Due to less marks in the exam. Failed in maths. Why is all that note pad for? It is for customers to give it as compliment. Why? Do you want it? How much? All that, entirely. Why? That much? One trick is there. Will you tell mother'? What will happen on telling mother? That is all big problem. Here comes Mother. Madam , is it you who is the writer Sree Devi Menu“? Who has written 'Veenalaruthi'(end of summer) ...and 'Viralpaadukal'(Finger prints) Yes. I'm a big fan of madam. I've read both the books. How come madam is not writing now? That is..Because of busyness. When family and children and all came. Is it possible to manage everything? Then, the second book is not that success, isn't it? After that a fear to write. The second book is madam's master piece. 'Veenal Aruthi' has got lot of awards and all. I like 'Viralpaadukal'. I know lot of people who likes that novel. Is it? Yes, indeed. I'm not a veracious reader and all. Even if I'm waiting for madam's next book to be published. Then, no need to say the case of good readers. It's too bad to stop writing, telling the issue of house hold works. Some topics, thoughts are going on. Madam, not just thinking at any cost should write. If I had quarter of madam's talent. I would have written ten novels now. Sometimes I'm over talkative. That is on meeting madam directly. Any way for the next work, all the best in advance. Shall I take leave? Good person. On telling me to come. And by that time sculpted, is it not? Sorry, doesn't recognize who the person is? Who is this? Don't know Vinod. But very familiar have seen somewhere. Can't really recollect. I have come to the hospital. I'm in the business of door to door. Madam, might have forgotten that. Okay then, I came here for a sale. Shall I go? Welcome again to the Prime T.V news. Today, with us as chief guest, it is none other than. The fans who term him as world star. Famous film star, it is Boomesh only. Because of H1 0, N 10 virus, a new disease is caught. Dumb flu. The disease that is started in this Thenmala area. All the efforts are started to bury the disease in this area itself. The efforts taken n a speedy manner. On the disease prevention schemes undertaken... ...by the government. I'm utilizing this situation to congratulate the government. Sri. Boomesh, before ending one more last question. On your newly released movies. Now the one on which shooting is going on. 'If the attack hadn't come, I would have died' Against the so called movie. All Kerala Drunkard's association is continuing the agitations. How do you react on this? About that nothing to say. Do you have anything in special to say on that? Nothing at all to say. Family audience and fans are waiting for your response. I'm not responding. Boomesh, who renders punch dialogue on screen. Does it mean that? Boomesh in real life. Has got less of reactions. I don't have any thing like that, lack of strength. Boomesh, tomorrow if critiques say, is a person without strength. How will you react to that? If anyone howls on seeing the moon rising. Nothing will happen to the moon. Did you get it? Great! Broke the cot! This is enough. To spice this, that will be taken over by Prime T.\/. Son of a dog Boomesh. The film star Boomesh, who gave the punch reactions in the interview. The tumultuous ebbs of that are seen on the streets. More visuals on that. Then what? He is a big moon. Then who are the pariah dogs? We men! Without Boomesh, saying sorry, nothing of sort will happen here. Othenlvise Keralam, will burn like this. Son of a dog Boomesh, we'll take you. I know it was a big insult yesterday. No, nothing like that. If anyone who behaves like that, it will be real pain. Has got great dislike towards me, is it not? No, not at all. Then why not come to me, to take the injection? I have not told anything aboutAravind, to Vinod. On saying all of a sudden that is enough. The guy is really possessive. Then will have to explain who Aravind is and all. I used to avoid to the maximum, those kind of situations. That is why, yesterday like that. If I ask a matter. Don't get angry like other day. He is slightly strict, is it not? Must not wear specs, must not talk to boys. Does Anjana's mother know all this issues? To mother'? Yesterday, what Aravind saw is my father's wife. My mother was dead in my childhood. I didn't know that. But still ifAnjana, feels any sorrow, can't you... ...share it with Sree Devi madam? It's mothefs position only, isn't it? Why I don't know, I couldn't see her like that. I'm not that attached with her. Haven't you seen this? Small things are made worse, by simply talking. What will happen if two groups say that to channel? After all this days, have they talked each other? If I were there, would have solved the problem simply. Why a ridiculing smile like that? I told seriously. Shall we bet? What bet? If I come solving this issue between the fans and drunkards. Will you agree? What? By talking the problems can be solved. Not only agreeing. Must talk openly to Sree Devi madam and Vinod. With talking should remove the gap between you. So,this is the dead line. What ifAravind, fails? What to do on failing, tell. Shall I tell? Should collect an autograph signed on Boomesh's photo. Too bad, how come adoration like this? What is wrong with Boomesh. Isn't he real cute? Cute? Holy cow! Why? Can't I say my opinion. That is true. But always should say own opinion like this, openly. Did you get it? For example, Anjana, love to wear the spectacle more... ...is it not? So, say that opinion to Vinod openly. Take off the lens. Put the specs on the face. Those are too small matters. Many of the things what we feel small, are big things only. Come I'll show you. Come on. Look there. This is the real Anjana. Now remove that spectacle. It's not real Anjana, is it? Now remove that coat. If anyone says that this doctor's coat is also awful. Will Anjana, stop wearing this? Now take a look. This is for sure, it is not the real Anjana. For all individuals there are certain specialties only for them. That is the one, that makes us, as we are. When that is not there, we will become someone else. Make sure Anjana, is like Anjana. MC Movie Channel Why on pouring on to yourthroat, you seem to"? Put some pickles man. Contem ptible fellow! Brother, are you the union leader? The president of drunkards association. My name is Aravind. From where are you talking? Sir, I'm from here. Cut the phone fellow and call later. Not fluent with English is it? Brother, I came to say an important matter. You people, movies of actor Boomesh... Don't say a word on Boomesh! What did he think of drunkards, fellow? That is what I was coming to say. Let each one think in their own terms. Everyone should posses the freedom to express the opinion. On seeing a movie, if you didn't like, don't see. Since you don't like, stopping the shooting. To ban the movie. What kind of a logic is there? Only if it is seen, the com patriots can say. Whether it is good or bad. We'll ban the movie. We will disturb the shooting. Son of a dog Boomeshe! MC Movie Channel Stop it man! Stopped, are you the police? Brother, allow me to speak. Tell brother, tell. Brother, kindly pardon us. Brother, opened our eyes. Brother, don't cry. No won't cry. If you sign an agreement, saying you have no problem with Boomesh. It will be a great relief. Will sign and give anywhere. Take brother, pen. Brother, is it true or a dream? It is their leaders sign, that is lying length wise. Hey fellows, all of come running. Look at this. How did you manage this? Is there any problem that is not solved. On talking directly, brother. Then our brother Boomen's movie shooting can be started, is it not? The shooting will take place and the movie will also run. We don't know how to say thanks. Brother, which areas fans club are you coming from? Area, this area only. Till now couldn't join the club. Must join, will join. You Boomesh. We will drink by brewing you. You dog, contem ptible fellow! Then on saying strike, is withdrawn? No idea. One minute. You dog, contem ptible fellow! Stop, $109- Brother, on saying the strike is stopped and all, yesterday night. What happened when it dawned? Let me ask one thing. Who are you? I'm Aravind, haven't I come to meet yesterday night? Fellows, did he come to meet us yesterday? Yesterday, till mid night haven't I dried all the... ...water in my throat, you cheats? When? Then by hugging me don't you remember, you cried? Cried? Me? The president is the person, who doesn't cry when wife kicks on the chest. President Salsa Kuttan. Hey man, handsome boy. We will take drinks but the brain is absolute. Trying to fool drunkards, you rascal. You fraud Boomesh. Son of a dog Boomesh. Leave it brother, it's okay. When the intoxication got over, they might have forgotten the case. But any way this heart is there no, to do this much for our brother Boomesh. That we accept it. From this moment onwards brother, you are included as the special member in Boomesh fans association. Brother, no need that is okay. Take this T- shirt and wear this. No need. Those who are infected with disease. Doctors and hospital staffs who interact with patients. There is a report dumb flu affecting them. As the research results bring shock and fever among the people. The information about the disease is hidden by the government. This is the report what the Prime T.V has come to know. Actually is dumb flu contagious epidermic? If so, how does it get infected? Is the existing disease prevention measures inadequate? By hiding the answers to these questions by the government. An attempt to clear off the apprehensions of the people. Doesn't think it will be fruitful from now on. Because with the telecasting of this news bulletin. Prime T.V is damn sure the people will be panic. You simply don't create a commotion. Please just move back. All of you just move back. Don't jump like starved children on seeing biriyani. Other than health minister to whom does one ask... ...about the disease? My brother, just leave the case being a minister. Can't you give a consideration that he is a being who cannot talk? While asking just show the sign whether it is true or false. Sir, no chance, bad lunar positions will really take its ride! Sir, it is heard that dumb flu is contagious? How does it get affected is it through air or food? Vinod, shall we not meet each other for few days? Will take a small break and re-think once again. No, no that will be really straight. Look, I have a matter to say. Don't think disturbing you, the moment you came. For few days thought of telling a matter" Don't know how long to go on with this play. That thing started making the noise. Hey fellow! Sasi, phone is ringing man! What to do sir? Throw it out. Hey fellow! Who is it? It's..C.M..Sir! Yes sir. Wants to say an important matter. The movie which has got a controversial comment. In the presence of the controversial movies director. To discuss and decide on the matter. That is what is decided by the two groups. The fate of brother Boomen's movie is... mpresently on our tongue's tip. Those guys doesn't have any common sense or brains. Brother you also come along, you may be required there. Vinod, you are controlling me a lot. Doesn't think that will be fine from now onwards. There is no chance to avoid going. What happened Sree Devi, is there any problem? No, nothing, I was thinking to tell one matter. From all side there are severe pressures, Thachapuzha. In a situation like this, when the health minister itself, can't talk. What to do? That will be a bad name for party and the government. Now, other than your resignation there is no other way out. My dear sir, don't beat on the chest like this. Even otherwise the heart is weak. Not weak man, my case is gone! My sir, it is said that when one way is closed. 9 other ways will open. Then you open and show. On putting the egg on ones chest. It will turn to bulls-eye, that is the situation. Hey man, you call C.M on that thing. And tell a medical wonder has happened. My talking ability was regained, when sitting in the... ...toilet by morning. From health research wing. It is confirmed that the dumb flu is contagious. Has send the report by fax. Vinod, how to say this? That..l don't... Is itAravind? This is from orange F.M. One vacancy on R.J has come up. Okay sir. Do one thing, that is not to forget. Just glue a reminder note on the side of the fridge. Shall I go? After continued examinations and experiments. It is confirmed, that the dumb flu is contagious... ...from individuals to individuals. Only through one thing, the dumb flu will spread. What is that thing? Through talking. Read Not only that the disease will get spread by talking. Already those people who are infected. On talking more will create the situation of the disease more complex. Because of that, only way to stop the disease spreading. Is to introduce a ban. What, a ban? The discussion that is scheduled on tomorrow or day after tomorrow. Problems between the drunkard's association and fan's association. It is expected that it will be resolved. What was it, that you wanted to talk? No nothing at all. Come for the audition just talk and go. Okay sir, definitely. Sasi, read man other than goggling your eyes! It is said to ban. What? Talking! Sir, from now on, no one should talk in this Thenmala. 'Talking injurious to health' As the disease is spread only by talking. Till the medicine is invented for dumb flu. It is to be made sure that no one is talking... ...in the region ofThenmala. Did the nerve of the laughter got snapped off? Hey man, it is not simply saying, God is there. Hey man, when things become like this. Even the comm unist's become believers. Now, everyone's talking is blocked, is it not? Sir, for that is it laughing, should cry, is it not? Hey fool! If no one is able to talk. Then why should I resign? Now, on one will come to ask. And we can talk freely between us. No, no we cannot talk. The ban is meant for poor citizens. That is not applicable to us. Last month, when the commissioner banned the speed of vehicle. What happened? The ministers are still going in 100 speed, is it not? Sir, that is, the police knows who is the minister. Who is the Panchayat president and all. But the dumb flu doesn't know that. That is really a threat. On keeping quite, the left over sound will remain in the throat. Then why are you keeping, on talking? It seems there is a curious virus. One fine morning, the Kondoty bus heading to the south. Did this virus come in that bus? From where did it come? Is it from Uganda, or Ukraine? If that virus had come from any Konalk Place. We are not going to remain salient. Till this disgusting ban is called back. Our party members day and night. Will keep on speaking in front of the mike. I'm asking. Making me to ask. Is there a constitution here? Is there a governing system? Is there a rule? The ruling ones, you take it. Till death, we will fi..Fi..Fight! MC Movie Channel The ex-minister, opposition M.L.A Thomas Kuzhivelikunnil has expired. Against the ban on talking at Thenmala. While inaugurating a relay on talking strike. As organized by the members of the opposition. While talking during the inauguration. He died collapsing during the function. On getting enthusiastic and on an empty stomach. He talked the talking of two men. That is the reason why. Forgetting the dumb flu severe. Instead of losing the ability to talk, the life itself was lost. This death was because the tongue in the... ...mouth, never remained silent. On seeing this the com patriots at Thenmala, are really shocked. Till the medicine is invented for the disease. Kindly cooperate without talking. As requested by the district collector, to the people. "Till the next official information is released..." "...it will be in definitely closed down" "Chicken thief" MC Movie Channel "Next movie.." "The star is the drunkard" Instead of written official declarations. With your constant request on demand of face-to-face... ...interview with the health minister. On that we have gathered here today. The questions from media persons, are per-recorded. By pressing the switch of a specially designed machine. Only the minister will be answering. It is due to the in-efficiency of the health minister. Making to spread the dumb flu vigorously all over Thenmala. Leading to ban the talking, a criticism as leveled like that. What do you have to say on that? A good question. The next question. How far is the research going on, to invent... ...the medicine for the dumb flu? Will this medicine bring back the talking ability that is lost? When will the ban on talking at Thenmala, be withdrawn? This government has taken all the steps for that. Till now, how many have expired by affecting the dumb flu? By next week, will the num ber of dead exceed 100? This government has taken all the steps for that. This government has taken all the steps for that. A good question. The next question. Thank you, greetings.

The things which cannot be expressed on talking. We can make them feel by actions. Whether it will take place or not. Should do the things which are rig ht for the mind. On doing like that, there is a pleasure evolved, is it not? On achieving what all things, that will not be obtained. MC Movie Channel From today onwards for the dumb flu. The preventive medicine and the injection will be... mavailable in all the hospitals. The nasal spray can be used directly by individuals. Without the physician's help.

Without any conditions. At least from now on without talking unnecessarily. At the most required time. The things which are needed. Let the talking be effective. The Prime T.V wishes you all.
