How could... You don't believe in monsters. I do. This is what it's all come down to, is it? Oh god, it was you the whole time, how was I so stupid? A homicidal bandit. How could you do this to us? We're friends. What now? So what now? And what's next, huh? Are you gonna kill me, too? You gonna kill me, too? Come on out before I kill you. Take the mask off. Go on, show yourself! Go on. Show yourself. Not a monster, an execution. I don't know who you are, but I'm begging you, please. - Please! - Please. Please don't kill me, I don't wanna die. There was half of us dying out there. Not like this, I don't wanna die like... - I don't wanna die! - I don't wanna die! The creature has the mind of a murderer. Please don't hurt me! Well, if you hadn't have cheated on me, then maybe this wouldn't have happened, huh? No wonder I am the way I am, you can only cage someone for so long before they break free. Hi, my name is Kia Anderson, I am with Little Fish Casting. Profile. And my hands. And what are your thoughts around Sarah from Heart Breakers? Sarah, well, I think that she is totally relatable. For me, anyway, I was trying to think of what I could draw upon for her character and I think it's just to have someone that makes you feel so vulnerable and unwanted, I mean... Are you aware that the role is unpaid, Kia? Yes, that is fine, yeah. I'm okay with unpaid work if I believe in the script. And are you happy with full-frontal nudity? What scene is that in? The bit where Neil has not rung her. She's just got out of the shower. Walks down the hallway, full-frontal, gets into bed. Sure. So, here's the thing. In these times, it's getting hard and harder, and, I mean, for a blonde girl like yourself in the industry, you know, right? And obviously, with your career, it's been such a rollercoaster ride with all those close calls and near misses. I know, I know. I mean, I think today went really well. I feel like I have a chance. And there weren't that many girls in the waiting room, so... I believe in you, I really do, and I wouldn't say that if I didn't think so, but, okay. It's your age. Annoyingly and sadly, there are so many girls. It's so competitive. See, uh... - So what you're saying is... - Yeah, babe. I think we should call it a day. I'm sorry, but... You're gonna get another agent, I've got no doubt about that and you're great, you're talented, but I just think I wouldn't be doing my job if I kept you on it'd be unfair to you and I'm sorry that I never was able to give you what you wanted. It's just so difficult and... So she just dropped you? Yep. I mean, I know I have what it takes. I just haven't had my big break yet, you know? I mean, luck plays such a huge part. It's like my agent didn't have a hook to sell me on. To get me into the room for the big auditions, to drive people to choose me over everyone else. Honestly though, with your profession, how do you know you're gonna be good? Like seriously, if I was going for a job interview, I would have like a week or something to prep, like minimum, but with yours, they're like, "Oh, can you come in the next day? "Got an audition," you know, Irish accent? It's so hard, I just don't know how you can be good. It's like they just wanna cast people who are the role. You know, that's not why I did this. I don't wanna play Kia in a film. That's not what drove me to this profession. Don't do it anymore, quit. Stop. You're just always, you feel so negative about it, and you're always saying how the same five actresses get the same roles all the time, I just, why don't you just do something that makes you happy? I love it when I get to do it. Yeah but then you can't even afford things like a car. You're right. Sorry. If I'd have worked this hard in any other profession, I would've climbed the ladder, I know that. Why was my first job so fun? Everything has gone downhill since then. What was your first film called again? Colorado. - Oh my gosh, can we watch it? - Reese, no! Come on! What're you doing snooping around down there? You're not gonna see it, okay? I have this weird connection to it, you're not seeing it. No, honestly, you should do what makes you happy, okay? Just don't like seeing you down all the time. Now the ball's in your court. Thank you. It's okay. Every 20 years people go missing, they die. They disappear. I have developed... It's not a scarecrow, June, who is it? Fuck all skills. Yay. All right, June, snap out of it now. Scarecrow, it's a scarecrow, it's a scarecrow! If only this had got a theatrical release. Hello? Hey, is that Kia Anderson? Yes, who's this? Hey, this is Tim Johnson. Director and producer of The Final Scream. You sent a self-tape recently for the title lead role of Melissa. Ah yeah, right, Melissa, was that on Casting United? Yes, I believe so. Listen, Kia, I absolutely love what you did with Melissa. It was exactly what I was looking for from the role. So we'd like to invite you to the final recall. Really? Wow, that is incredible. Yes, yes, I would love to. When is it? Well, it would be this weekend. So, apologies for the short notice. This weekend being tomorrow. It's a two-day shoot, so tomorrow and Sunday with myself, and other members of the crew at the location where we'll be shooting. We'll be going over scenes, exploring the characters, things like that. You're the only actress that we're calling back at this stage. Of course, if it doesn't go to plan, we can always see others in line for the role. Wow, that sounds absolutely amazing. Yes, I will be there. Can I ask, is it a paid role? It is, yes. I'll send you over the details by email. See you tomorrow. Please don't hurt me. Hi, my name is Kia. Woo! Delete, delete, delete! Hah! No call center job for me. Tell me who it is. He's coming, he's coming, he's gonna kill me, it's him. All right, June. Hey! Hi. What are you doin'? I got to the finals for a feature film. No way! Oh, my god! Oh, my god, that is so good. I'm so excited. What're you doing with all this stuff? It's like over an hour away. Okay, so why do you have all this stuff, though? It's a weekend workshop. - Oh! - Yeah. So what is it about? - The film? - Mm-hm. Okay, it is about this character, Melissa. Hopefully me. And I've come to the UK for my wedding, with all my bridesmaids, we go on a road trip, and then everyone starts to go missing one by one. It's a horror film. Oh. Well, do you have the location and stuff? I do, yes. I have it in an email somewhere, I'll send it to you. Yeah, just be good to know the details, you know. - Of course. - Yeah. - Finally. - Okay, let's get you packed. Okay. Okay, so it is a weekend workshop, I've done them before. He'll probably just get me to perform the scenes with the other actors but I am the only one called back for the role. What, so you're gonna be the only girl? Yeah, that's crazy, right? Well, yeah. Okay. Hey. Why do you have to do that all the time? Do what? That, this is normal in my industry, okay? - Why do you have to do that? - Okay, sorry. Just worry. Okay, well you're not my mom. Even though I appreciate it. Can I borrow your car? Wait, did you just steal my car keys? Maybe. You were totally gonna run off, - without even saying goodbye? - I'm so naughty! Yeah, with my car! You are unbelievable. Seriously, you don't need to worry. This is very normal for my industry, okay? Okay, well just make sure you call me and stuff, 'cause just... Come here. Stop worrying about me, okay? Okay. I do love you, okay? I love you. I'll see you in a couple of days. Don't go. - Wish me luck. - Okay. Good luck! - Hey, love. - Oh, hi. I'm Kia Anderson, I'm here for the callback. - Hello, Kia. - Hi. We know who you are, 'cause I've seen all your tapes. - Oh, awesome. - Yeah. Oh, I'm Ruth, I'm the makeup artist, forward-slash sound recordist on this shoot. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. I've put your name on a door in the house, 'cause everybody was working really late, so everyone's really stressed, so if you just wanna go in and put your bag down and make yourself comfortable and then one of us will come in and see you later. - Great! - Okay. Be rested. Be ready, be prepared. Tim. - You took your time. - Hey. Oh, you know me, I'm a slow driver. Oh, it's fine. So, are you there, how is the place? It's good, it's isolated. It's exactly what you'd expect for a horror film. - Nowhere to run. - Well, that sounds great. Are you excited? Yeah. Reese. Reese. Somebody help me! Please. I wanna go home. I wanna go... I just, call my mom. Please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please. Please no, please, please! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please don't hurt me. Somebody help me, please. Somebody help me, please. Help me, please! I don't wanna die, please. Please, no, no! Please, no! Get off of me! Take that off of me! Please get it off of me. Get it off of me, please. Help me, somebody please. I can't do this anymore. Help me. Please help me. Please. Somebody come and help. Ah. Kia Anderson. Lovely to meet you. The pleasure is all mine, Tim, it's all mine. I bought the costume that you, the black t-shirt. Good. Go for it, Kia. Oh, um... Okay, I've been on some TV shows, I have played support in a lot of feature films. No, no, Kia, I'm not interested in being sold your CV. I want to know how you work. Your audition tape, it was something quite spectacular. All the other girls, they just felt false, you know? It was the same lines with the same rehearsed inflections in the same places, there was nothing real, nothing raw about them. I didn't believe them, Kia. Whereas, with you. Well, you took Melissa to a whole new level. Wow, that is such a compliment. Well, I guess as an actor, I've just always wanted to be truthful, so if I have good company in a scene, then I will just respond to them instinctively. No, I like it. It fits well with how I work, you see, I have a very specific way that I like my actors to work. I want my actors to genuinely feel everything. That they see, that they say, that they do. Of course. I want it to be the closest it can be to reality. - Yeah. - On screen, you understand? I want the audience to actually question, is this happening? - Exactly, I know, yeah. - You see? Mm-hm, method acting. Yeah, I've always wanted to just become a character. Yes, well and you are Melissa in a lot of ways, aren't you? Well, I'd like to make some more distinctive choices. But yeah, there's a part of me in every character, but I'd like to play Melissa as Melissa. I understand. Right! Should we get started? Of course. Ah. Team. This is Kia Anderson. Hi. We met last night. This is Jeff, he's the cameraman. Director of photography. - Hey. - It's nice to meet you. Hi, nice to meet you. They're going to be documenting the process this weekend. Oh, cool, okay, so like behind the scenes and... - Exactly. - Cool. Hi. Right, should we get going? It wasn't your fault, Lisa, he attacked you. Okay? We'll go to jail if I'm caught. If we can't dispose of the body soon, we get caught. I don't want to go to jail, Mel. You need to stop thinking like that. I promise you, we, I'm gonna get you out of this. Just, cut, cut, cut, cut. Look, Kia. I need you to really believe what you're saying. Have you ever been in a situation where you've been really close to losing someone? I mean, Lisa going to jail, it's the next thing to life or death. Have you ever experienced something like that? Well, when I was younger. I lost my mom. How did she die, Kia? In the hospital, she had cancer. She died in the hospital. I want you to really remember your mother, right now. I want you to remember what she was wearing, what did her skin feel like, what did the room smell like that day, what was the temperature of the room like? Answer the questions, Kia. I was 16. I had caught the bus to school that day. I had this, um, this urgent phone call from my dad telling me to come to the hospital. It was... It was the last time to say goodbye. And he looked so scared. Because he was gonna lose his wife for the rest of his life, his best friend. He was so pale. I remember sitting next to the bed and just... Just waiting for her to die. And in this sick way... Go on. And in a sick way, I wanted her to die. What happened when she died? What did you see? Her body jolted up. It was like she couldn't breathe. It was twitching. And I saw her take her last breath. Look at me, Kia. Use what you're feeling right now. Think to scene 92 where Gina herself dies in your arms. Her throat is slashed and she's gasping for breath, just like your mother gasped for breath. See her there, see her in your arms, dying in your arms. Picture her, fighting for her last breath, knowing that she's going to die. See it, Kia. And now the lines of scene 92. Don't leave me. Please don't leave me. And your mother dies. She is gone forever and you will never see her again. You will never see her face again, you will never hear her voice again. And the lines of scene 92, Kia. No. No, don't go. No, don't go! Please don't go, don't go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, stay with me. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Nice work in there. Thank you. He can be tough. But he's only tough when he likes the performer. If he didn't believe in you, he wouldn't give you the time. That's nice. You won't get signal much around here. Being in the middle of nowhere can be problematic like that. Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a good thing for the film. You know, so much screaming at the end. No one around, no one can hear or complain. Sure. Right, that's enough of a break for now. Should we go out into the woods? Scene 104. - Let's do it. - Right behind you, boss. Okay! Kia, scene 104. Now, Melissa has managed to escape the masked killer, and has managed to make it through the woods, but, oh, shit, she doesn't have a clue where to run, and having left a friend behind, what can she do? Sure, okay. It's a question, Kia. Oh right, sorry, Melissa, Melissa, okay. Kia, Kia, Kia, come on, come on. Okay, she needs to figure out if she is going to keep running or if she turns and she faces the problem head on. Win or lose. Win or lose, now I like it, so yes, Melissa's fight or flight is well and truly in action and what does she do? - She fights. - She does, indeed. The real hero of the film comes to life, and she goes to unmask the monster that has taken the lives of her friends. Oh, so my script finishes at 110, so can I ask who the killer is? Well, you don't actually get to find out who the killer is until we shoot the scene. Trust me, it's a hell of a twist. Okay, I hope it's not me. Right! Show me what you've got. And action. Stay away from me! Stay away from me, I said! No, don't kill me! Don't kill me! I know who you are! I know what you did! Help me! Help me! Please don't kill me, don't kill me. I'm scared, don't kill me. Don't kill me, don't kill me! Oh, shit, was that okay? I feel like I went too high-pitched. No no, it's good, not now, come on, let's keep going. - Okay. - Okay? No, I'm gonna do it again, okay? - Okay, come on. - I'm gonna stand up. Okay. I know what you did to my sister, but I'm innocent! I'm innocent! Please. - Please, please, please... - Yes, yes, that's the one! That is the one, Kia, that is the one, that is perfect! I'm not gonna lie, I feel flustered. That's good though, Kia. That's how you should be feeling. - Yeah? - Yeah, that's the energy. - That's what she has. - Okay. I've been trying to call you all day, I'm so sorry. It's okay, don't worry, how's it all going? So good, Tim was really impressed with what I did today. He seemed really into it all. He was giving me all these really great comments and stuff. Well, can I come and see you if you get it? I would love that, yeah, it feels really isolated here... How are you? I'm good, how are you? I'm well, thank you. Listen, Kia. I want this whole process to be that of method acting. You understand? Yeah, got it. So, um. No phones. Melissa has no communication with the outside world, so, neither should Kia. Now, Kia. So, I'll take your phone now? Great. Meet me downstairs in 10 minutes. We'll have some dinner and then have one last rehearsal while it's dark. And from now on, we're going to refer to you as Melissa. No more Kia. Why do you think Melissa chooses to go back and save her sister, rather than picking her fiance? I think that whatever happens at the wedding can be resolved. But she can't not go back for her sister. She could die, she could lose her forever. In real life, your boyfriend. Would you leave him at the altar? Well, if I had a sister, I would choose my sibling. Okay, I want you to really picture your boyfriend in your mind's eye. Imagine the devastation on his face, standing there at the altar and you not showing up. Well... What does he look like, Reese? Oh. Well, Reese is a girl, and I think that she would be, yeah, really devastated, but if she thought that my sister was in danger, then she would totally understand. Is something the matter? Sorry, Kia. Melissa has a boyfriend. Yeah. And it's now coming to light that you are gay. Well, that shouldn't change anything. You didn't suspect anything until now and I don't think the audience will, if I do a good enough job. No, I'm sorry, it just doesn't feel right that the actress playing Melissa can't truly connect to the actor playing her boyfriend. Yeah, but in saying that, I don't connect with a lot of people that I work opposite. It's like a sex scene. You're not turned on, you're performing, you're working. You're doing your job. Melissa, how did your parents die? My dad's not dead. Melissa. How did your parents die? I'm sorry. They died in a car accident when I was younger. They, from food, food poisoning? From uncooked food on a vacation. Are you saying that Ruth didn't cook this food properly? No. No, no, I'm saying that that's how my parents died. Did you even read the script? Yeah. Well, then I think it's pretty damn obvious what happened to her parents. Her mother got into debt and died from drinking. Her father killed himself. I don't think that's written anywhere in the script. It's in the subtext. I know, I wrote it. Okay, let's go outside and do scene 111, killer reveal. Stand there. Right. Scene 111, killer reveal. Oh, I don't know the lines to that scene. I don't know who the killer is. Improvise them. Fine, I'll fucking spoon feed you. Scene 111, killer reveal. All your friends are dead and you are the last one standing, face to face with the masked killer. And action. You. Huh, who are you? Who are you? What do you want from me? Huh? Stay away from me. I said, stay the hell away from me. Um, uh... Take off your mask. I said, take off your mask! You. How could you? How could you do this to me? How could you do this? Look what you've done! Look what you've done to me. Huh? Huh? Look what you've done to me! What do you want from me? Let's just wrap it up for the evening. - I don't actually know... - Just stop, okay? You're tired, you're just not performing well enough. I didn't... You were spellbinding earlier, but it's... Tim, I don't know who the killer is. It's just sloppy now! Just go away, okay, and be Melissa! You're still being Kia. Be Melissa! Be in the moment! Look, try not to worry about it. It's just the way he works. It's his process. Anyway. Sleep well. Hi, Kia, it's me. Been trying to call you a few times now. I've just not heard from you. I'm just getting a bit worried, okay? Can you just call me and let me know you're okay at least? Love you. Probably one of the crew. Scouting tomorrow's location. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. No, it's fine, I'm just a little on edge. Come sit with me. Come on. Well, I can't say I wasn't expecting - to hear from you so late. - Yeah, sorry. I know it's late, I'm just worried about Kia. Why, what's happened? I just haven't heard from her since you sent her on that callback. What callback? For the horror film. I never got her a callback for a horror film. Glass? No, thanks. I didn't know you'd done casting. Indeed. Melissa is the last role to fill. Thank you, I didn't know. Oh. I see Bev has completed her scenes. You've begun filming? We started a little while ago. You have Harley Dawson from The Parent Trap playing Talia? Go on, sit down. So, what's up? What do you mean? With you, something's wrong, what is it? You know, Melissa in this situation, she'd tell me what was wrong. She'd have the balls. Okay. I don't think I am what you're looking for. I'll leave first thing in the morning. I don't wanna disappoint you anymore. You have Melissa inside you, you know that, right? You just need to let me help you release her. Kia is the problem. Kia is the one who won't back down, who won't allow herself to be real, to be vulnerable. To be honest. Kia is the wall that we need to break down. You've got to stop being so sensitive. 'Cause the role's yours. Wait, what? You are Melissa. You just need to let me help you release her. You've got the job. Oh, my god. Really? Oh, wow. Tim, thank you so much. I am gonna work so hard on this. I know you will, Kia, I don't doubt that. You're gonna be a big star, you know that? Go on, go get some rest. We start filming tomorrow. Filming? Well, why not? Now you're cast, let's get to the action. Go on, get some rest. Thank you. Thank you. It's going to be the role of a lifetime. Goodnight. The only thing I can think of is to check her emails or something, just to see if I can find any information on it. Oh, god. What? I told her not to use these online websites, but I mean, you know her better than I do. She probably hasn't listened to me. Check Casting United. - Okay. - That's it. What's Casting United? Basically, it's a website where actors can put themselves forward for their own work. Nothing gets checked though, so there's no organization as such checking everything. You, me, anyone could upload any sort of job, and lure anyone in. That's it. Yeah, The Final Scream. There's no information on anything. Check her email. Okay. No, I don't know the password. Look, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, okay? Let me get in the office tomorrow morning and I'll do some digging. Hey. It's gonna be fine, all right? I'll do everything in my power to get the info. Don't worry. Thank you. So, it's a bit of a surprise, isn't it? I know, I can't believe it. So where are the other girls, are they on-location? Yeah. Well, sort of. They auditioned, I don't know, weeks ago, and they're really into their method. Yeah, it's quite amazing. You wanna see 'em, they're like crying and shaking, and it looks really truthful. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, it's good. You're really beautiful. You have lovely cheekbones. - Aw, thank you. - Yeah. In fact, you really are quite beautiful. Thanks. Yeah. Okay, well anyway, there's your costume over there. If you wanna go and put it on, and I'll see you on location. Well, it is a horror film, remember. Gina. Gina! Oh, where are you? You've had the idea, you know where they might be. Make the decision to find your friends in the warehouse. And cut. That's the one. You think? You were born for this role. Okay, on the next one... I always thought that the camera would be a bit bigger, than like this. What do you expect for this kind of budget? It's 4K, it's good enough for the distributors. What's up next? I think let's go for Kia face to face with Gina. So, the one where Gina dies in my arms? Oh, no no, no no, it's a rewrite. Let's crack on with the scene where Kia finds the actresses. You mean Melissa finds her friends. Exactly. She's on it, this one, she's not slow. Right, Kia, headphones on and get prepping. I want the first time you meet the girls to be on camera. Right, let's get going! - Janice? - Hey, Reese. Look, I've had a deep scout of this project, and it doesn't even seem to exist online. Meaning, if it doesn't exist, no info online, then this could really be just about anyone. No one in the office knows anyone attached to it and even Casting United are clueless as to who put the ad up. So you're telling me that some strangers put this ad up to lure young hopefuls to audition in the middle of nowhere? Yeah yeah, but it's normal in this of work. Christ, I send some of my clients to people's homes all the time, but I obviously don't do it by a bloody dodgy website. Kia's first job was from my site, so I suppose she had a reason to trust it and... Kia's first job, Kia's first job. Hang on, hang on. Reese, what's happening? Yes! Yes. Thanks so much for coming, Melissa. I didn't know who else to call. That's okay, let's just get going, eh? Yeah. I've got the location and the address. Jeff, keep this one on Kia. Won't be able to get this shot again. Sure. Tim, what do you want me to do? It's an intense closeup. Okay, so, on action, you're gonna walk around the corner here and discover the girls. Melissa's about to discover what she's gotten herself into. Improvise lines as you're going round, you know, you don't know where you are, things like that. Okay, right, so, it's all improvisation? - Exactly. - Still rolling. Sound. I am recording. And when you're ready, Kia. Action. Hello? Gina. Gina? Are you there? Gina? Gina, what's going on? What's going on, what's going on? Turn your backside. You have to get out! You have to help us, please! Jeff, I want Melissa's reaction! What's happening? What's going on? Kia. Find the keys, let the girls out. Let the girls out, Kia, come on, faster. - Look at the camera. - Come on, Kia, come on. Let's go, let's go, come on. Killer reveal. Told you it was a hell of a twist. This is a good shot. 42 minutes away. - Can we go faster? - Just, calm down, okay? It's gonna be fine. Sorry. Sorry. Help me. Help me. - Help me, please. - Please. Tim? Please. Oh, my god, oh, my god. Let me go, let me go! Ruth, what's going on? Stay in the moment, Kia, don't ruin your scene. Tim. Tim? You look pretty. Isn't she, Kia? How does it feel being a movie star, Kia? I'll need your autograph soon. You sick fuck! You fucking sick fuck! And that's a wrap on Sue! Okay, now we get to the good part. Ladies, you all have 10 seconds. Now let's give one hell of a performance, yeah? 10! Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run! Five! Four. Three! Two. One! And... Action. Come on, come on. Stop it, stop. What the hell are we doing? There wasn't a gas station for miles, I drove here. I'm coming! We need to get the fuck out of here, now. - We have to split up. - No, we can't... Shh, shh, shh. She's right, okay? It's gonna be the only way, if we wanna get out of here. No. Shh, you want to get out of here, right? Jade, I'm sorry. It's gonna be the only way we can get out. It's the only way. Come on. Let's go! Jeff, zoom in on the girls. I got this. Okay, go, go, go, go! Ah, you wanna play that game, huh? Okay. Run, run, run, go, go, go! Tim, the girls. Get them. Oh, they won't get far. These woods are a maze. Besides, we won't have a film if we kill them all now. The reviews will say it was typical. They all got away. They won't get away. No. You must be here for the audition. You better come with me, then. No. No, come on! Come on, the keys are in there, come on, you're bleeding! - Anything? - No. It's just voicemail again, should I call the police? No, let's not jump to conclusions. We're only about 20 minutes away. Look familiar? Think I wore it for the closeup. Oh, how fucking original, Tim. Ruth. Why don't you go and make yourself useful, mm? Go back to the house, and get cracking on yesterday's footage. I would like to see a rough cut by this evening. Who's gonna do the sound? There's no sound in this shot. Off you go. We'll fix it in post! I can't find them. I can't find them, I can't find them. How long did they have you down there for? Since last week. I've been here six days in total. What did they do to you? Okay. Listen, we're gonna get you out of here, okay? We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Listen to me. We're gonna get those psychos put away for good, okay? I wouldn't be so sure about that. No, it's gonna happen, okay? Okay. - What is that? - Shh. Come on. Get to my car, we get out of here, okay? No. - No. - Come on. Hello, girls. One more! Oh, you wanna go? I'm sorry, I didn't realize. No, that's fine. Damn it. Jeff! The camera on that bitch, now! Help me! Help me! Why are you doing this? Don't you realize? We wanted to make the ultimate horror movie. Have you never heard of a snuff movie? Well, you're the star of one now. She's just as sick as they are. No! Come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on. Think we're close. - Oh, my god. - Is that her? - Yeah, Kia? - Reese? - Yeah, Kia, where are you? - What's she saying? Is she okay, where is she? Stop! Reese! Reese? Hello, Emergency Service operator. Yeah, please. What's the nature of your emergency? - It's a fucking emergency! - Is anyone injured? I don't know where I am, okay? I just need someone to come and get me. We need more details of your location to track you. Did you girls really think we'd make a horror movie where the lead actresses get to escape in their car? That girl. I fucking ran over that girl. Jeff, closer, right in there. I wanna see her die on camera. Oi! What the fuck, get away from her! Filming in progress. Excuse me. Who the fuck invited you onto this film set? No friends or family allowed. Hello, where are you calling from? It's not fucking starting, what's going on? Hello, hello? - Give me the phone. - Are you still there? Hello, do you have our location? - We need more details. - Oh, no, where is she? - I don't know. - The battery. The battery's gone. If she's gone to get the others, we're fucked. - We need to get out. - I know, I know. I know, let's go. Okay, come on. Okay, okay, okay. What the fuck do you think, get the fuck away! Stop filming! Oh, my god! Looks like this bitch wants her closeup. I think you're right, Jeff. Well, that's fine! There's always room for the kill count to rise. Reese! Reese! Time for the money shot, bitch. Reese! Fuck! Reese? Reese. Reese! We've got to... Hey, did you hear that? Oh, my god! No, no, no. Please, please, please, please. Please, please. Please, please, no, no. No, no! Action! Help me, help! - Camera rolling? - Yeah. Right. Let's fuck up survivor girl. Tim we're not picking those bullets up too well on camera. Eh, fix it in post. Stop, please! Oh, my god. You're pathetic! You're fucking pathetic. Now, you are a lead actress. I mean, that other girl, Jade? She's all right, but you, with your cute body... Fuck you. Fuck you! Okay. But maybe a bit later. Don't worry. I'll make sure that we have the best sex scene. I think you got the sex scene with that other girl, Jade. More like a porno, what you did with her. You're sick. No, leave her alone! I'm gonna give your girlfriend what she really wants. You know what? She's gonna love every second. Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you. Shh. Leave her alone! Let her go! Jeff? Gonna wanna get in close on this one. Just fucking kill me already. No, you don't get to pick or choose how and when you die. We do. Fuck you. You're here. - Okay? - You're here. Bitch! Now who's the bitch, huh? I'm gonna fucking kill you! So you wanted Melissa, you wanted Melissa? She doesn't die in this film, she doesn't die in this film! Not in my movie. Oh, we're not watching your movie anymore. We're not watching your movie! Oh, god. People want this. They're tired of Hostel and all that shit. They want the real deal. That's why we're here. You better put on a fucking good show. Last kill and all, hey? Better go out with a bang. I should tame him. It's time for your big closeup. No, stop! Stop! No, no, no, stop. No, no.
