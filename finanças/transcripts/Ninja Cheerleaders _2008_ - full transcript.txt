I understand that you're trying to get into Brown. Yes, sir. Well, I... Um, I... I suggest looking at the last three chapters. I will. Oh... okay. Good luck. Thanks. Say, I could use a little help studying. - Sorry. - What's the hurry? You're holding a 4.0, help me out here. Help with studying? Yeah. - Nothing else? - I'm serious. So, my place. I've got to go. You want a ticket to the gun show? - Mmm... - You can get a feel for them tonight. I live in the guest house. Very private. Mmm... Maybe a bottle of wine, some soft music. I'll wear something tight, no bra. Legs glistening with baby oil, shaved... ...all the way up. Yeah. Oops, you popped out. Should we study after work? Finals are tomorrow. Why not, I've been running on six hours sleep the entire semester. Settled. My place again? Yeah, it'd be best. You know how my stepfather is. A man! So, tell me about Red. Red? You know, concussion, laceration to the forehead, wearing a straight jacket in a padded room, that Red. Oh, that Red. He's sweet, in a lock your doors, mace in hand, don't be alone with him, innocent kind of way. Alright ladies, on my count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Alright ladies, looking good. We'll go with that routine for the game tomorrow. Just remember your steps and you'll do fine. Now hit the showers! Er, whatever it is you do. Oh hey, April. Yeah, coach. Semester is almost over. Uh-huh. What about the summer? Aw, I'm just taking it easy. Yeah, I've heard that. Me too. Going to Mexico. Really? That's awesome. You should check out the pyramids at Chichen Itza... Yeah, um, say, I was thinking that... since you're looking for a break and I'm going down to Mexico, maybe you'd like to come along? Seriously? Yeah, it'd be totally legal, you know. I mean, with you being 18 and all... I mean, damn, it would be a great time. Margaritas, dancing all night. You can even drink... Hey, come on silly, we're late for choir practice. Okay, bye coach. See ya' coach. Good talk, girls. - Choir practice? - It was all I could think of. Thanks for the save. - What's up? - You don't want to know. Red invited April to Mexico. Ooh, lucky you. No, not lucky me. Buckle up. Extend further. Front kick, begin. Kick higher, rapists still rape with sore thigh. Good. Solid kick. Needs more control. Kick higher, follow through. But I can't, it hurts too much. That is good, that means your muscles are growing. So I can look like them? Yes, with much work you will look like them. Sparring! Begin! Come on now honey, don't look so serious. This is your first time here so I'll take it easy on you. A guy like me wouldn't hurt a pretty little thing like you. Aw, thanks. Unless you want it to hurt. Where did you get that black belt? A garage sale? Damn, that had to hurt. See, the goal is to bring your opponent to the ground. Yeah, but this cat likes to play with the mouse... and then finish it. Enough! You see, she used her opponent's weight to her advantage. All I'm saying to you right now man, is Napoleon was a tactical genius. I'm not saying that he wasn't, all I'm saying is he wasn't better than Alexander. Oh, wow! Okay, hold up, That was 2,000 years before gunpowder... Evening ladies. He made strategy, he invented it... No one could take the tactical genius away from the man. Exactly. I never liked Napoleon that much. Cool, because he was the greatest conqueror ever. Certainly he won many victories, but by sacrificing exorbitant numbers of his troops. And, let's not forget the North Africa fiasco. Ah yes, tragic. And the burden on the people, taxes, conscription, and that whole channel crossing nonsense, what a waste. Besides, Attila or Cyrus were greater conquerors. We should go. Bye. You got to understand, our whole family, we run this city. You want to continue to do business you're going to do it with us. No. You're making a mistake, pal. A very big one. This club is mine and mine, alone. I think it's time to go buddy. Oh, wow, you're looking for this? Bring your ass on. I'll be back! Hey, hey! Watch the suit, I just got it pressed. Into the bank. How much? Seventeen hundred. Oh, good night, huh? Not bad. Good luck tomorrow night. What's tomorrow night? The all-city strip-off. Fifty grand for first place. Damn! You said it. Oh my God. What? If you win, that will put you over the top. You mean, this could have been our last night? If we win. Over the top? These girls want to go to an Ivy League school. Yeah, me too. With grants and scholarships they still could not afford it. So we've been dancing over here at night and saving all of our money. We figured it would take about two hundred and fifty thousand. Two hundred and fifty grand! You've only been here six months. Only been 18 for six months. That's incredible. We are very popular. Everybody loves them. Yeah, in a scary kind of way. Well, all we need to do is win tomorrow night. And, my business will tank. Such are the fortunes of life. Wait a minute, who was that little guy? You mean, Jimmy the Snitch. You've got to be kidding. That's what they call him... big time mob connection. It was nothing. You girls go ahead and study. You've got a busy day tomorrow. Okay, good night. Good night. Adios. Oh god. Evening ladies. Party's over, guys. No, no, no, no. The party's just beginning. Hey, hey, hold on now, sugar bear. Come on man, be cool. Relax, I know what these girls want. Let's go, this is crazy... Shut up. You girls work in a place like this, you know what's expected. Oh, really? What's that? Put it this way, when you're having trouble walking tomorrow, you'll know. Everything alright ladies? Fine. You want me to call an ambulance? Yeah, that might be a good idea. So, you gonna help out or what? No, I think I'll sit this one out. - Mind if I join you? - Please do. - With this tiny thing? - I'm sorry. Is this what you were going to hurt me with? I'm sorry. - I have tiny balls, say it. - I have tiny balls. Say it like you mean it! I have tiny balls! She's so full of energy and it all has to be negative. Play rough, huh? I'll play rough. I'll play rough. Come on. Okay, should we go? Unless he wants to play. - No, no, he's nice. Three broken ribs, broken sternum, - two broken noses. - Oh, no, that wasn't me. I just watched. Broken jaw, broken leg, concussion, contusions... They go too touchy. Black eyes, lacerations, Jesus Christ, you took out half the Navy. Well, play with fire and you get burned. And you're the fire? What do you expect, you're a stripper. I'm not a stripper, I'm a go go dancer. Fine line. Not with me. Hi, mom. A letter came for you, it's on the counter It's from Brown. You've been working. Yeah, um sorry. So, are you going to tell her? - You have to tell her. - Tell me what? - Go on, tell her. - I'm trying to. If we win tomorrow night, we've made enough money. You know how I feel about this. I know but, mom, we've done it... And I'm going to Brown. - You all spending the night? - Yes. You guys do great on your tests, okay? So, in the latter stages of a star's life, it enters triple alpha. Making carbon, right? Carbon 12. Hey, what are you studying? Human evolution. I wanted to take that but I needed freshman chemistry. How is it? Looking at fossils and seeing 5 million years of evolution, it's, it's... Rewarding? Yes. My mom would have been in home economics. Well, I for one am glad things have changed. Me too. What time is it? One AM. Should we get some sleep? I guess so. But I'm not sleepy. Well, we have over an hour for lunch. Where do you want to go? How about a workout? That would certainly clear my head. Excellent idea. Oh my God. Mr. Hiroshi? Mr. Hiroshi? I don't think anyone is here. The number at the club is busy. Manny! Manny, Manny can you hear me? Hang on. We'll get you some help. I don't need any help, I'm fine. Shh, just be quiet. It'll take more than a bullet to keep me down. They should have used shotguns. Goddammit! Will you shut up? Yeah, I need an ambulance. I got to... What you got to do is stop talking, okay? Uh, 1700 third street. If I don't help him, they're going to kill him. We'll take care of it. Look, you called the ambulance, you got to get out of here, they'll have you here for hours. Go! You guys, he's right. No. - No, we can't - Monica, there's no time. The safe is gone. What? They ripped it out of the bar. I'm not going to do it. Do what? Dance, for another six months. I can't. What are we gonna do? How long until our next final? - Finals? - Yes. You're going to worry about finals now? If we want to get into Brown, yes. How long? 40 minutes. Then we have time to look for Jimmy the Snitch. Yeah, but where? Nah, I don't feel like going to your moms for dinner. Just be with me, be with me. Hmm, monkey steals peach. April, no! Jimmy the Snitch. Remember me? Uh, there's not really too much memorable about you. Last night. I don't know what she's talking about. - Damn it! - Remember now? - Hey, you bitch. - Oh! Damn it! Just washed? Yes. I had plans, dreams, a future. Don't we all, honey? Couple hundred thousand worth of dreams. That's very touching. And today somebody ripped them out of the bar. Yeah, we all have our ups and downs, don't we? Tell me where my money is and where you put Hiroshi. Screw you, alright. - You think I can crush it? - No. I think I made it pop, neat. Now, where is Hiroshi? You sick bitch. Okay, this is getting us nowhere. You have a better idea? Drop his drawers. Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing with my pants? Think of it as a cleansing enema. Enema! What do you think will hurt more? His intestines filling up with water or that metal nozzle? I don't know nothing, I told you, I know nothing. I think the nozzle, but he may like that sort of thing. - Look, I don't know where he is but... - Too bad. Hey, do we have any lubrication? I'm sure Jimmy here... ... never offers any to his bimbo. - Is that true? - Take a breath, this is gonna hurt. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Look, Lazarro's eight o'clock. Why did you take him? I didn't do it, I didn't take him. - Who then? - Victor, Victor! He ordered it. Do we believe him? If he's lying I'm going to shove this hose all the way up. It's the truth! What do we do with him now? We could keep him in the trunk. Eww, he smells. I, I, I, I'm afraid of small places. Okay, I'm claustrophobic. He's gonna make a lot of noise. No he won't. Yes I will, I'm very loud. Nice. My Ninja skills are complete, butterfly. I should not have doubted you, grasshopper. Um, did either one of your geniuses think about putting him in the trunk first? Uh, no. You have a mean streak in you today. Yeah, and what's up with all the nut crushing? I don't know, it just seems right. Cool. Yeah, men think they're superior. So, I'm just crushing that theory. Okay, well we've got a lead but I don't think we can wait until eight. I agree. What about finals? Screw finals. And our applications to Brown? Some things are more important. I don't think Hiroshi would agree. Okay, I don't think he wouldn't want to die so we could take some stupid tests, I'm sure of that. Why don't we act now, go into the restaurant and start busting some heads. No. Look, we know they're going to be there at eight. They don't know that we know and we'll have that element of surprise. She's right. Hiroshi would not want us to act now, I'm sure of that. They want something from him or he would be dead already. We just have to find out what. Right, so let's go find out. After finals. Unless you want to spend the next semester at Los Lomas Malas. Fine, after finals. How did you do? Fine. So, what are we going to do? Rescue Hiroshi, get our money back and go to Brown. Okay, but how? Jesus, keep whining! Ladies, your vehicle? Yeah. I'm detective Harris, metro PD. Oh, hi. Hi. So, you were at the Strip Palace this afternoon? Strip Palace? - Eww. - Gross. Downtown, off third. Oh, we were downtown for lunch. Lunch? Sushi! Oh yeah. Oh, so you were at the Strip Palace? We got lost. I think we pulled into a parking lot around third. We got lost? Sushi! Then you never entered the establishment? A strip club, oh gods no! Ewww! God, this is our future. Ah, so, ah, did you see anyone exiting? Nope. Why? It's a shooting, nothing to concern yourself about. Oh my gosh. We could have been shot. Scary. Was anyone hurt? Uh, I'm not really at liberty to discuss it. Really? Nu-uh. Yeah. Well, thank you for your time. And if you have any other thoughts or... ... just call me at my office. K, bye. Bye. He's cute. Totally. Close call with the flat-foot. Yeah but it won't be long until he figures out we're lying. We've got to be careful. Okay, he's at Woodman medical center. And... And he made it through surgery and he's in recovery. Hey, sailor. Hey, handsome. Hey, pretty princess. Aw, you don't look so bad. I'm alright, I'll be out of here in a couple hours. No, you'll be here a while. What, you a doctor now? No, but I can read and it says right here that you'll be in bed for two weeks. Put that damn chart down, I'm getting out of here today. Well, don't worry, we're going to find Hiroshi. Worry? We're talking about the mob here, not a couple of drunken sailors. We know. You know, uh? We can take care of things It's not like we're invalids. Nah, this is going to get bloody. I don't think you girls can handle this. Us girls will do just fine. I'm gonna call a couple buddies, we'll put some things together... I said we got it! Okay? April, you were a bit harsh. So? Manny is our friend. I know, I'm just sick of men thinking that we need their hand-holding to do anything! Come on, Manny's not like that. Whatever. Okay, well now's not the time for a philosophical debate anyway. Fine. What are you doing? I was hoping to find something on Lazarro. Look at this, Times, 1988. Victor Lazarro convicted for racketeering and money laundering. Well, that's a lead, but if he's in jail... Alright, look at this. Times, two days ago. Notorious crime boss Victor Lazarro paroled. Gotta love our justice system. Yeah, but what does he want with Hiroshi? Look at the picture from the first report. Hey, that's the club. Alright, now read the caption. Victor Lazarro pictured at his famous club on third, which will be auctioned off by the IRS on Tuesday. So that's how Hiroshi got the club. The club has been home of the Lazarro crime family since the late 40s. With Victor Lazarro in jail and the remaining family members deceased this will mark an end to a... bla bla bla bla. It was his club house. A family heirloom. And I bet he wants it back. You can have them stop now. Does it really help you? You have no idea. If he knows where it is, he ain't telling. Impressive. You know, it's funny. Hi detective Harris, what are you doing here? Well, I was taking a victim statement. And then I see this piece-of-crap VW in the parking lot. - Hey! - Not nice. And I say to myself "I know this piece-of-crap VW. This is the same piece-of-crap VW that was at my crime scene." Piece of... Yeah, the same piece-of-crap VW that was spotted when my Vic was shot. You're a meany. It's all I can afford. It's a classic. Cut the crap. What are you doing here? Well, we came to see if that poor man was alright. I thought you said you didn't know him. Oh, um, no, we don't, but I told sister Mary what happened and she thought we should go and see him. Sister Mary? Uh-huh. So, you just came by to check on him? Charity is where the heart is. Okay, that doesn't even make sense. Nu-uh. Well, we got to go. We have to cheer at the game tonight. - It was nice to see you. - Whoa, whoa wait... So, you said you were never in the Strip Palace. "Gross," was your statement. But a lot of guys down at the station, they have been at the Strip Palace. And they keep going on and on about this great act with these three hot college girls. Yeah, I think I'm gonna take the three of you down to the station. Nu-uh. Uh-huh. What's the charge? Well, let's start with obstruction of justice. Careful, watch your head. Wouldn't want you guys to overheat. I'm going to talk to Manny, you guys sit tight. This is just great. Okay negative Nancy. Relax. "Relax." Yeah, an arrest is going to look real great on our record. You two are so stupid. Yeah well, they can't arrest what they don't have. Hiroshi could be dead right now and you want to go take finals. Shall we. You coming? Don't push it. I'm sorry. It's not funny. I'm sorry, it's really not funny. You made me look like a complete ass. At that point I could have helped you. Why didn't you let me help you? - Yippie Kay Aye mother fu- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough with the Die Hard references. Had to be a cowboy. No, cowgirl. Girl. Boy. Girl. Girl. Yeah, I got that. Where to? We still have a few hours before we have to go to Lazarro's. Where do you want to go? We can go to Roland's house and get our music for tonight. Okay. Always the optimist. Well, if we want to win the contest, music is key. Hiroshi's been kidnapped, our money is missing, and you want to go pick up music. She's right. Music is key. Thank you, Monica. No need to get snotty. Oh, then let's go to my house. Our cheerleading uniforms. Of course. Jeez. Hi, Roland! - Hey, how you doing? - Good, you got our mix? Dirty Hearts, got it right here. - Hey, you coming out tonight? - Absolutely. - Alright, we'll see you then. - Alright, see you then. - Bye. - Later gator. - 1187 Huntervauser. - That's my house. - What? - Where I live. Nice place? I guess. She doesn't look so tough. 34 people in the hospital might disagree with you. Cute too. So now you send some more victims to the hospital. And I feel really bad about it. Rough world out there. Some things you just can't let slide. You know? No, I don't. Well, you can't. Anyone want a water? No. April? Remember when we used to do that? Yeah, I loved it. Screw off! That won't do. I'll go get our uniforms. What the fu... Hi, girls. I remember when I used to sell cookies. - Really? - Mmhmm. You know, I think that man wants to buy some if you'll wait a minute. But he was so rude. No, you know what, I think he's going to apologize. That was very rude. Yeah, here he comes now. You know what, this really hurts. Hi girls. This man would like to buy some cookies. How many boxes? Two. How many? Three! Three or four, maybe, possibly. - 20 boxes! - What! Are you crazy, little girl? Oh, he doesn't have any cash. That's okay, we take plastic. Oh, that's perfect, isn't it? - What do you say? - I'm sorry! - What do you say! - I like cookies. Where you been? Working. You been working a lot lately huh. So? So... I think maybe it's time you started paying for a little room and board. Al, a month from now I'll be gone and you'll never have to see me again. Brown? What? Your acceptance letter, came in today. Thought we agreed you couldn't afford that. - You opened my mail? - You're living under my roof, you're god-damn right I did. You had no right to... Oh what, do you think you did well on a few tests and you're better than the rest of us. Is that it? I think I'm better than you, yes. The tests don't have anything to do with it. It's the fact that you're a drunk and you haven't had a job in months. My mother should have never married you. You sass me Missy and I swear I'll... What the hell is she doing? Meeting the neighbors. Bye girls. - Bye. - Bye, good luck. Okay. Thank you. Aw, are you playing nice? She won't share. What do you think you're doing? Playing humpty dumpty. Do you want to play, Al? Come on you guys, leave him alone. Hey, we're not through with this, Missy. I don't want you getting your mother all upset about you ridiculous pipe dreams. Why do you take that from him? If I hurt him, he'll make it harder on my mom. Her fault for living with the bastard. Oh I'm sorry, not everybody can be as strong as you April. What's that supposed to mean? It means you have some anger issues. So what? So quit preaching to me about your warped sense of reality. My warped sense of reality? Courtney, you haven't even told your mom. Wait, you haven't told her about Brown? No. No, she doesn't know anything. Oh Courtney, you have to tell her. Well, it doesn't look like we're going anywhere anyway. You got in! Yeah, I'll hang that letter next to my community college degree. Anything else? I guess we better deal with that. Yeah, I suppose so. You guys almost ready? Almost. You've been really mean to us. Leave then. April... I don't want to be around either of you guys right now, just... You don't mean that. We've been friends since the first grade. Just please talk to us. I just hate this town and what we have to do every night. We all do. Yeah, but I thought we were done, I thought we were, you know. We'll fix it, we have to. What if we don't? Then we'll think of something else. - That's not good enough. - Oh, April. We love you. I promise, we'll make this right. Okay? Okay. I know what they were looking for. What's that? The deed to the club. Then let's give it to them. Hiroshi would never forgive us. Yeah, but at least he would be alive. Do you honestly think they'll let him walk away? Any of us? Come on, boys. Here's to unfinished business. Salute. Salute. Then we will continue? Continue? I'll be damned if we're not going to run this town. What about the syndicate? The syndicate, they'll step aside or they'll die. As well as the Russians, the Colombians and the Jews. What about the women? Well done, well done. Indeed, I have never seen such efficient work. We'll take Hiroshi now. What? You think I'd have him here, when I knew you were coming? You got my nephew, Jimmy, in the trunk of your car. You can keep him. Now listen, I understand the contents of the safe belong to you, is for your your college education, right? That's right. So, all you got to do, is give me the deed to my club, I'll give you Hiroshi and the safe. How about, you tell us where he is now. Or what? You'll kill me? I don't think so. Come on. Come on, you give me the deed to the Strip Palace, I'll give you Hiroshi's life and your future in return, nothing less. No deal. Give him to us now, or you die. Angelo, if you don't hear from me in one minute, I want you to cut off Hiroshi's... His index finger. So you see, if you're not out of here in one minute, I'm gonna be having Yakatori for dinner. Sweetie, you don't even have balls. Not yet. Now look, you call me tonight when you have the deed and we'll make the exchange, capiche? You got 30 seconds. I don't know where Jimmy is. I'm going to his uncle's right now. Those bitches are gonna pay. You know what those words represents... So, did you see what you need to see? Yes. They are gifted. Is that going to be a problem? Not for Kinji. Good. Don't follow them, they'll be looking for that. Besides, I think they'll do what I ask. And when they do, I'll give them Hiroshi's stinking corpse and an empty safe. And then, my dear Kinji, you may have your way with them. Yes. Victor Lazarro? Yeah? Okay... He's the biggest crime lord in the county. Sure. It is our job to police this town, not yours. Glad we could help you, though. Okay, you could have gotten hurt, he's a very dangerous man. It's a Ninja thing. You just wouldn't understand. You okay? Yeah, I just thought that... You thought it would be that easy? Yeah. We'll get him back. As long as we have the deed he'll be safe. You know, we could call detective Harris. No. We do it our way. What's that? Nothing. Uh-huh. Can we go now? Uh, no, no. Not until you open it. But what if I didn't get in. And you're supposed to be the tough one. You're in. You're in! No! One hour then. No tricks. Los Lomas Malas College. It should be secluded, take the deed, kill the chicks. You got it boss. Lazarro says one hour. One hour then. It is time to put our Ninja skills to the test, grasshopper. I'm ready, butterfly. Let's rock and roll girls. Come on, you know you love it. I only took this job because I thought it would get me to coaching ball faster. Careful, 16 will get you 20. 20 what? Yeah, that's funny. You could've coached men's lacrosse. Yeah, lacrosse. Lacrosse? You've got to be kidding me. No, no, no. Men's lacrosse. Yeah. Men's lacrosse. So, what's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying you spend a lot of time with those girls. Yeah, with the girls. Oh, taking my job seriously now is some sort of crime to you? I don't know about a crime... but it's something. You were in the war? Yes. As was my father. Those were glorious times. Only one who was never there would say so. You may not believe this, but I don't want to kill you. I believe you. Actually, I'm thankful. You know, somebody else might have turned my club into a coffee house. You're welcome. This is not secluded. Company. Maybe we shouldn't kill them right away. Why not? Dude. Hey coach, we need to go back to the triangle offense. Look what's going on out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why don't you worry about your girls? Yeah, your girls Red. Alright. Hey. The deed! I have it in here. No funny business or the old guy gets it. What the hell is going on in here? It's a private matter. Well, it's my locker room. You little bitches, get back out on the court. You can do your damn whoring around after the game. Thanks, I've always wanted to do that. The deed! Here it is. Monica! Monica. That looked like it hurt. Thanks. Any permanent damage? No. Come on, we have to hurry. What are you doing? How about this? You know what, I think this is it. Oh, where do you want to put that? No, please no. I've always loved it when they use this on TV. What do you want? Please. Where is Hiroshi? Come on sugar, make it easy on yourself. I hate to see a grown man cry, it's so humiliating. Warehouse 24, Flower street. I am Kinji. Kinji likes that you know her name before you die. And does Kinji think she's gonna kill all three of us with that one bolt? Kinji thinks that the three of you will soon be dead, and Kinji is glad. Police! Put the weapon down! Detective Harris, I strongly urge you to fire before you find a rod of steel in your chest. Kinji will kill this pest and be right back. You're not that fast. Kinji is that fast. Hey! You're supposed to be dead. - Hang on, hang on, hang on. What? You sent five guys to the hospital, in the process you got me shot, you know where Hiroshi is being held and you decide to go to strip off. You're just bitter because you got shot.

My father opened this club and I ran it, until my unfortunate incarceration. But now that I'm out, I'm taking back what's rightfully mine. It's not yours to take back. What do you know, huh? Obviously you've never run a crime family. Look, I respect you, but you gotta go. You are the one who will soon be dead. What are you talking about? Those chicks, those dancers? They're already dead. Perhaps. Hey, you've heard of the dark ninjas, huh? They were expelled from your homeland for questionable morals. Well I hired one, to take care of your chicks. Perhaps you should have hired two. Loud! Totally! Bruno... Time to die,Hiroshi. You were saying? What's the matter with you, huh? You guys were supposed to fight with your feet. Mr. Hiroshi. Oh God. Ninjas don't use guns. Ah, but I am old and I forget the rules sometimes. But you forgot about Kinji. Ew, not this psycho again. Hello? April baby, where you at? Had to run, sorry about that. I got the check right here, you won. Thanks. We won. Yeah, yeah sounds good, good one. Now, where were we? Kinji is good. Is Kinji done playing with children? Kinji is done. Well? We'll do it your way, probation, won't go to their records. Great. Bryant cut 'em loose. Hiroshi? And Bryant, why don't you take that to them. Kinji? Oh, no, no. I got big plans for Kinji. ♪ It's bananas ♪ ♪ B-A-N-A-N-A-S ♪ We were rolling, so now the world's gonna see that. That's okay! S- sorry! I'm acting! Bravo! Very credible. Would it make you happy? Monkey steals peach. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three. Kinji doesn't like jail. What news do you bring me about them responsible for my son's death? I'm sorry to have to say this, Don Lazarro but it looks like they're all going to get off, all of them, and even Hiroshi. They're ruling this thing self-defense all the way Well I got big news for you Mr. Soon-to-be district attorney, I'm gonna kill Hiroshi and them Ninja Cheerleaders, if it takes me the rest of my life!
