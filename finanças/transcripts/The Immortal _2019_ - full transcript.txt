> CIRO: When I was little and I was at the orphanage, Do you know what the nuns told me? > The earthquake is the will of God. > It is good for the earth. > Like when a person is sick. > And accumulate, accumulate... > until it releases and vents... Or die. (FIRE) (SHOUT) Help! Ciro! Ciro! (CHILD CRIES) Ciro! > CIRO: I went down to hell to understand. > GENNARO: After everything we've done, we're still here. > Only you and me. > CIRO: Shoot, I'm tired. > GENNARO: You can't lie to me. > Killing your kids' mom is something you can't forget. > CIRO: Shoot! Take it, give me a hand! > CIRO: With these hands I killed my Deborah. > I would have killed anyone who got in the way. This is Ciro Di Marzio, the boss of Secondigliano. Let's do our dicks. (CHILD CRIES) Is alive! > CIRO: I have lived all my life with death near. > I'm not afraid of dying. Then what is said is true. The Immortal does not kill anyone. The blow they shot at you in the chest stopped an inch from the heart. I need to smoke, do you have a cigarette? Where is Gennaro? Your brother is fine. While in a coma, he retired with his family. Why are you keeping me locked in here like a prisoner? If you're in here, it's because nobody has to know you're alive. Otherwise I don't know how this story ends. God wanted you alive, gave you another chance. It's a shame if you don't use it. So out there you no longer have anyone waiting for you. You must go, Cirù. Far. I am opening an important channel. And I need someone like you. I can give you a new life. Think about it. Ciro Di Marzio? Dimitri. (IN RUSSIAN): Welcome. Yuri Dobeshenko. (RUSSIAN ACCENT): From here I see the whole city. This is the tallest skyscraper in Latvia. Latvians were part of the great Soviet Union, but they wanted independence and became Europe's butt. They didn't understand that we Russians are still the masters here because we command the economy. Don Aniello spoke to me very well about you, I am sure we will do great business. The load is coming. The day after tomorrow we make the delivery. Well, Dimitri lets you know where. (IN RUSSIAN): Accompany the boy. (CAR ENGINE) Here we go. Friends. (LATVIAN ACCENT): I lived in Italy for two years. Yours is also a beautiful country. (SPEAK IN LATVIAN) He is Emils, our boss. Welcomes you to our home. It didn't seem like a welcome. (SPEAK IN LATVIAN) Russian pigs believe they are in charge in our house. They believe they can invade Latvia again with their dirty money, but they are wrong. That's why we need your cocaine. I don't care about your wars. I am a broker, I deliver drugs on behalf of a seller. My salesman already has deals with the Russians. If you want to be a broker, you must first stay alive, Italian. We know that Russians pay 20 per kilo. We Latvians pay 21. 0 do business with us, or you can die with the Russians. But is it worth dying for a war that isn't yours? (EMILS SPEAKS IN LATVIAN) (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) > Cirù. - Don Aniello. > The load has passed the check, is coming. > Tomorrow morning I will send you to my person. I'll handle that. (CAR ENGINE) Good morning, Don Ciro. Don Aniello sent me to pick you up. Let's go with my van, so I'll show you the place. Those are our containers. I did the customs clearance, we have a warehouse. We bring the stuff there. Now we go there, so you know everyone else. That is not a commodity, it is personal. I know that you have found me accommodation, bring everything there. No problem, I'll take care of it. All right, we can go. (WHISTLES) I have the honor of introducing you to the person who sent us Don Aniello. From now on he will stay with us and we are at his disposal for anything. Virgil. He is my right arm. He maintains relations with the people of Naples. It's my pride, I raised him like a son. We were waiting for you, Don Ciro. You have a house near me, for anything you ask me or my wife. Pasquale keeps in touch with the people of the port. If you need anything, ask me. - Eligio is our best seller. - Bruno exaggerates, I only do mine. Franco and Salvatore, logistics and warehouse. - Nice to meet you, Don Ciro. - Good morning. This is my paranza. All the counterfeit stuff from this country comes out of this warehouse. We are the best in the knitting trade. Come on uagliù, go to work! Now I take you to see the laboratory. There we can transform a piece of the market into a tailoring garment. Come with me. - Good morning. - Good morning, Bruno. It's all OK? Come. Elga, Pasquale's wife, Annunziata, Eligio's wife, Dora, Franco's wife. Vera. Virgil's wife, she has prepared the house for you. The apartment? It's all OK? - As you commanded so I did. - Good. Now I'm going back to work, sorry. Allow. Let's leave. They brought you the furniture. Come. This is the home of Vera and Virgil, above are Franco and Eligio with their wives. It's all right, quiet, you have seen. Nobody bothers you. I am ahead. If you need something, available. You are on the ground floor, the entrance is here, the first door on the right. The days here never end. During this time of year they last 19, 20 hours. I made you put the blinds, otherwise it is difficult to sleep. Now you can go, I need to get some rest. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What are you doing here? - I want to learn the trade, can I? But don't touch anything. Uè! (HORN) Uè! Stop, stop! Stop, thief! Stop! Bruno! Cirù! - Did you bring what I asked you? - They stay here. You are great! Cirù! My love! Break these candles. Hey, Cyrus! Hi, uagliù. In the candles there is the ceramic, what we need. Watch and learn. Beautiful! Bruno! - Can you tell us the story of the Blackbird? - Yes, you haven't told us about it. - What should I tell you? - All. He's number one, nobody ever stopped him. - You have to say why they call him 'O Merlo. - Tell us. - Do you want to know? - You can tell them. Because when it brings the motorboat it seems to fly over the water. - A lightning. - Really fly! He once had seven lookouts behind him. Seven! It was night, there was a stormy sea. - They took it. - Not at all! It was going so fast that if I burned it. Him, the motorboat and all the guards behind. When did you meet him? A year ago, in front of the Recl Bloom. I was with Stella. He arrived in an exaggerated car, he was with two two-meter-long females. - Two meters! - They were bone. But how was he dressed? He had an exaggerated fur, he looked like a lion! Good boy. Everyone respected him, kissed his hands. - And he gave everyone money. - How do you become like this? You must never trust anyone and you must not be afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything. - Are not you scared? - No. - Not even to die? - He is the Immortal. True, it is the Immortal. But I don't want to die. - You don't wanna die? - No. Then this life is not for you. - Do you want to become like him? - I? Even stronger. Come on, uagliù! To work! See you later. Two behind and one forward, without brothel. (MUSIC) Move! Bruno, here! - What have we done! - Go! Go! Run! Well done. Hi Nuncio. Hi Bruno. Hello, uagliù! Can you give me a cigarette? - We were good today. - You were good, Cirù. Goodnight Bruno, goodnight Nunzio. Hi, Cirù. Let's go to sleep. Good night. Goodnight, uagliù. - Goodnight, uagliù. (HORN) - Dad, did you bring it to me? - No, Tommaso, I forgot! Come on, I told you a hundred times! Hold on! Do you like? - Hi, Bruno. - Hello. - (IN LATVIAN): Are you all right? - Well. - The usual? - Vodka, please. Did something happen? Is the house all right? I didn't come here to speak. I have a problem, I need a hand. But it is not an easy thing. I would do anything for you. - Shall we go to the rides? - Yes, let's go to the rides. They have arrived. Come. Here we go. Hello. (SPEAK IN LATVIAN) You made the right choice... broker. (IN LATVIAN): We are the winning horse. (IN RUSSIAN): Follow me. It is a pleasure to do business with you. From now on you and I are brothers. You will have my protection and my good. Come with me, Annarella. - It went well, didn't it? - What have we done! - We were good. - Yes, but now what happens? Now let's see, he's coming. Nothing should happen. We did wrong doing this. We have nothing to do with these trades. Vera is right, these things are dangerous. It's true, but maybe things can change. If we get into this business, we will stop starving. But we don't starve, Bruno. What we have is no longer enough for me, I broke my cock to always keep my head down. What are you going to do? You have never done these things. You worked all your life in the patches, making scams. This is us. This is our life. You think I'm not able, do you? I am afraid, Virgil. (HITS ON THE DOOR) Good evening, Don Ciro. These are for you. Mamma mia, how much money! If you want, you can work with me. There is convenience, but there is also risk. You are giving us an exceptional opportunity, thank you. Don Aniello has never given us this trust. From now on, my word is enough. But it's not a game, it's a big thing. Think about it. The choice is yours. Are we sure we have the choice? In life there is always the possibility to choose. The hard part is going back. Ciro! There '... Today I felt alive for the first time in 30 years. I have never forgotten you, Cirù. BRUNO: Uagliù, wake up! - Hurry up. - Close! Wake up. - Close the window! - No, we have to go. Cirù. Wake up, I have a surprise for you. Come on, hurry up. Then you don't understand! Don't you want to wake up? Don't be stupid! Eat whatever you want! Go! One hundred, two hundred, three hundred... four hundred. I'm 450. - How did you count? - Half as always. The stereos II paid 100. This we can have with my contact, take it or leave it. - It's a shitty contact. - Do you have another one? We break our ass for two lice. Uagliù, your part. Cirù! Good boy. Bruno, go outside, they are looking for you. (DIALOGUE INAUDIBLE) Be a good boy. - Who was it, 'O Merlo? - Yes. - What did he say? I can get into the cigarette business, my time has come. Now offer everyone a drink! To drink? I'll take you to eat tonight! Bravo, so do you! I have to binge. And what is the problem? Cirù... Do we bring them to hear how angels sing? Star? (MUSIC) (SONG IN NAPOLETANO): You wake up early in the morning to do gymnastics Loud the stereo, you like music. And you make yourself more beautiful with each passing day, you You put on the heeled shoe to quickly grow an inch more. She's good, huh? You fall in love almost every day, you only talk at night in your dreams And you only like the big man, Chiara send your brothers to that country And your mother defends you... Brava! Do you want to make a friend sing a song? Do you make a friend sing a song? Let's make her sing. Bruno! Bruno! - Sit down... - All right, don't worry. (SING): You fall in love almost every day... - I want to see when it happens. - Love, slowly! She is too good. Are you enchanting, Cirù? Brava! Brava! Brava! Good, Stella! Very good. Very good. You have been too good. - Did you like it? - Much. Let's do another applause to the singer! Good Stella! You have been too good. I want you to sing at my wedding. - But you have to pay me. - Bastard! Let's make a toast, pass the bottle. - You made me excited. - And how beautiful you are! - Me too a little! - Come on, a little! - Is small! - Here. - A drop. What do we drink? - To Stella. To Stella? To the singer and smuggling! We have to make money! You have been very good, love. Cirù, don't you tell me anything? Did you like the song? Yes, in my opinion you will become the strongest singer in the world. It's normal, it's my Star! - Sing again! - You broke your cock! What the fuck are you saying? Let's leave! Move! Come with me! Don't worry, nothing happened. Keep on eating. Ciro! Are you coming to the party tonight? - Children care very much. - I do not know. All right. The stuff has arrived. Do you have news for me? - Virgil, has my package arrived? - Yes, everything has arrived! Let's check. Here we go. One who escorted the cargo said that the situation in Naples is not good. The police seized a new load, now they are all against each other. Everyone says that Don Gennaro Savastano did well to get away from it all. But he is fine, he bought a nice villa in Posillipo. He has a new life. Have you been very close friends, you and him? We have been brothers. But I would never have shot a brother. I asked her. You? And why? Because he had a good reason to live. After all you've done, you've ended up in this shitty place. Why are you here, Virgì? The truth? I don't have the balls to change things. If I had them, maybe my wife would love me again. - Your wife loves you. - Yes, like a foolish brother. Do you think this and do nothing to change things? If I had been like you, then yes, but courage cannot be bought. But I don't have courage. I am not afraid just because I have nothing more to lose. When it was time to defend my family, I was unable. I've lost everyone. But now you have a family. You have to do better than I do with them, listen to me. The new load has arrived. Tomorrow we make the delivery. How long have we been doing good business together? My dear Cyrus. - One year. - One year... A lot has changed, hasn't it? I was right, we won our war. There is always a strange light in this city. Many say that this light makes you mad. A year as a partner without problems, we have to celebrate until the morning. - I have another appointment tonight. - You always have other commitments. Like someone with a family who has to go home in the evening. Malo you know too, people like us cannot afford a family. (NEAPOLITAN SONG) (SING IN CHORUS) (APPLAUSE) Cirù! Give me a cigarette. They all love you. They look at you like a boss. I see you among them, it has now become your paranza. - What are you saying? - It is so. I am getting old. Cirù... I must tell you one thing. I thought it was time to go back to Naples. I want to go back to my house. - When? - Next week. So soon? I have already organized everything, everything is ready. The responsibility of the paranza I thought of leaving it to Virgil, if there is no problem for you. No problem. What is good for you is also good for me. Thank you, Cirù. Goodnight, Bruno. Last night was a really nice evening. - We all had fun. - Thank you. The green dress looked great on you. - They all ate you with your eyes. - Yes, oh well... - Pure Cyrus was looking at you! - Yes, he looked at her. What the fuck are you saying? - Why are you angry? - What is it! - You don't see what I see. - What do you see? I see a lonely man who no longer wants anything. (BELL) I brought the clean stuff. If I disturb you, I'll come back another time. Come in. I left you the sheets clean. I finished. I didn't want you. I didn't want you in my house. I was afraid of you. Then time has passed, I understand. I misjudged you. Then things changed. What has changed? That I'm glad you're here. > CHILD: Cirù, what are you doing with that hair? > Go to the sweetheart? - Cirù, where do you have to go? - True, where do you have to go? - Come on, just tell me! - I understand, I think he's in love. True, it can be. What is this face? Go away, come on... Leave him alone! Ciro! Where do you go with this elegant hair? He is in love! See how elegant it is! He did his hair too! Where are you going from in love? (MUSIC) - Thanks for the ice cream, Cirù. - You are welcome. - This ice cream is good, huh? - Mmh! I also gave you a gift. They are beautiful. You deserve the most beautiful things in life. - And why? - Because you're an angel. I am not an angel. Why do you say that? Because angels are in heaven. The nuns at the orphanage they say mom was an angel and was in heaven. - Do you remember your mom? - And what should I remember? He abandoned me when I was two months old. And why? Because he didn't want me. Instead I always want you with me, Stella. Come on, I have to go to work. (CAR BRAKES, SHOOT) What the fuck was that? Who the fuck am I? But who the fuck am I? What do you want? Do you know whose stuff this is? (IN LATVIAN): Do you know who this cocaine is from? - Leave me alone, Bruno! - Stand still! Leave me alone! Stop, stop! No! But who the fuck are you? What do you want? Shitty men! (SHOUT, LAMENTS) (IN RUSSIAN): I'm sorry, Cyrus. But you have to come with me. Enter inside with the children. I said go! I have lost four of my men and 150 kilos of cocaine, I want it back. Only you knew, you knew when the load arrived. Some of you like to chat. Virgi... Cirù... It wasn't us. - I swear to you, we haven't betrayed you. - I know. Did you see? I was not afraid. I was good, huh? You've been good. Now we're going home. You are responsible for the delivery, so the problem is yours. - Yes, but Ii leave them alone. - No! They are my assurance that you will solve the problem. I give you 24 hours, before killing them all. - (IN RUSSIAN): It's not their fault... - Shut up! (SHOUT) Don't get mad, it's just business. I can't do it all alone, I need someone. Only one. Bruno, get up. Here we go. (MOTORCYCLE SIREN) Let's split! We're screwed, Cirù! We are screwed! We have it on. Cirù! What the fuck are you doing? Ciro! Ciro! Ciro! Ciro! Ciro! Ciro! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Cirù, in my opinion we are doing bullshit. (SPEAK IN LATVIAN) You have courage to come here. What do you want? I can kill you even now. The Russians know it was you. They are arriving. You have a chance to save yourself. It's me. Do you want to return to being master in your home? We have to kill them all. Why do I have to trust you? Because now this war is mine too. (HITS ON THE DOOR) Cirù! What the fuck happened? You are all wet. - What happened? - You have no idea! - Finance was behind us. - Finance? - Then? - There was nothing more to do. Bruno shouted: "We are screwed!" I threw myself into the sea. The water was frozen. I looked like a penguin! And I believe it. Dry yourself. The finance boat stopped and Bruno ran away. And where is Bruno now? A moment should come back. Don't worry, I'm here with you. Are you here with me? - Whatever happens to me? - I'm always here. Come here, get dressed. And if business is going well, I'll give you lots of presents. What gifts do you give me? Necklaces, watches, motorcycles, cars, everything you like. And then? Me, you and Bruno are buying a nice house in Posillipo. - With the swimming pool? - It's normal! So you take another bath, huh? With the swimming pool! Bruno! What have we done! You were great, Cirù. Take my shoes, hurry up. - But how did it come to your head? - Suddenly! You saved me, Cirù. Fix it up well, tonight I'll have his eyes redone. - What happens? - We performed a miracle. - 'O Merlo summoned us to the club. - Really? - AI Recl Bloom? - Yup. - We're going to make a lot of money. - God wanted it! We do them, I swear. It is normal, where Ii finds two like us? You said well. Here we go! I'll make you queen. - Don't be late. - Don't wait for us awake. (DISCO MUSIC) - Bruno! Wait a little over there. - Yes, I'm here. Good evening. - Who is he? - He is my son. Are you the one who threw himself into the sea to stop Finance? - Good boy! What's your name? - Ciro. Bravo Ciro, come here to uncle. Go get yourself an ice cream. Here. This boy has balls! How the fuck did a kid so cute to grow up with such an asshole father? But do you know that I pay for the speedboat petrol? It costs me three times more than other smugglers. What the fuck are you running? And the third time you risk losing your load. Who the fuck do you think you are? You have to do what I say, otherwise I'll kick your ass. He wants to command! He wants to do it himself. This child deserves something more. And also your lover, what's her name? Stella, do you think? Go away from Stella and change your shirt, it sucks. (Cheering) I'm a wimp. I'm not good, I had to spit in his face. He treated me like an asshole in front of everyone. - I'm not good. - That's not true, you're strong. I wish I had a father like you. Cirù... Come here. Are you ready? Here we go. - Let's rely on Sant'Anna! - To Sant'Anna! Our Lady accompanies us! Here we go! - Where are you going? - On the right track. What does it mean? The time has come to start our own business. Come on, Bruno! Okay, perfect. Power! Go Go! Go! Come on, go! Quick! - Go Go! - Take two. - You gotta place it tonight. - You're in the hands of art. Cirù, come! But if the Blackbird notices it, they get angry. I don't give a shit about the blackbird, we work and he takes the money. The time has come to put it in his ass! Cirù, move! What are you doing, sleeping? Where are our husbands? What happened? No one answers. Go out and bring the kids. Come with me. Mom... (CRIES) Where is Virgil? Where is it? Where is Virgil? I'm sorry. I need your help. I need you. You have to do one thing for me. - Only you can help me. - I've been looking for you everywhere. I was afraid that something bad had happened to you. - 'O Merlo is pissed at you. - I know, so I called you. We did some bullshit. Greatest. But we want to fix it. - And only you can help us. - I? And how? Go to 'O Merlo, bring it here. He trusts you. - Tell him we're sorry. - We want to apologize. We were wrong, but we don't do it anymore. - Are you sure he understands? - You understand. Of course he understands. By tonight we have solved everything and go to hear Stella singing. - Right, Nuncio? - Sure. Trust me. Go. Go. You know, Bruno... I respect these people. They do what they do for their land, for their family. I respect them, even if I don't believe in all this. I learned it as a child. People like us are doomed to be alone. Here we go. Are you ready? You are ready? Here we go. (SPEAK IN LATVIAN) Bruno! Bruno! Bru '! Nuncio! Nuncio! Where are you taking us? I know it was you. > STELLA CANTA: I want to feel you mine, I want a real woman The one that gives me warmth, that gives me true love You are shaking, you are sweating, you are knocking the world down run away and I have your scarf in my hands > No, that's not true, I don't want to believe it yet > No, that's not true, come back, this heart tells me You can't throw a love deep into the sea Maybe one day you will understand and return to me To stay forever... (MOTOR APPROACHES) Star! I took the cold on the street for 30 years and it didn't help. I deserved to finish big. You didn't stop even when they got your people in the way. - Virgil you killed him. - I didn't want Virgil to die. I wanted you to die! You took my life. You have become what I have never been. Since you arrived, I have only had one thought: to fuck you. But I'm not that kid anymore. You don't fuck me anymore. Get off! How old would Stella be now? Do you remember what voice he had? I have never forgotten it. What is it, are you afraid? But how? You taught me that. In life you don't have to be afraid of anything, not even to die. But you don't know what it means. I do. Because I'm already dead. (CAR ENGINE) Kill me. Kill me now. Death is a gift you don't deserve. There will be no peace or forgiveness for you on this earth. Now go away. I told you get out. (IN RUSSIAN): Why? Never leave enemies alive. That's what I think too. (IN RUSSIAN): No boss. Oh! Uagliò! Are you Cyrus? - Yes, I'm Cyrus. - Nice to meet you, Attilio. Now that I bring you to know Don Pietro Savastano, the first thing is education, understand? - I understand. - Bravo, let's go. Cirù, this is for you. It is personal.
