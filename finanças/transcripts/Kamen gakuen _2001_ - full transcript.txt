Really? What should I do? I don't get math at all. A test… Seriously? Hey listen. Last night, I got a party invite e-mail from Tonomura at West High! Really? What do I do? I've never spoken to him! Ignore it. But that quiet Tonomura went out of his way to invite me. I hate to just say no. Don't worry. Other people were also invited, Yuki. What? You too, Mitsugu? Look. Most of our classmates from middle school got it. Everyone was baffled. None of us were close with him. I wonder what happened. Hey… What's that? Hey, Kitamura. Money! Hey! I said, "Money!" Hey, could that be… What's with you? DANDA TORU Danda? It's Danda! Didn't you quit school? Ignoring me, huh? Well, you came at a good time. Hey, hey, hey! Aren't we brave! What's with you? What, have you lost it? Even with a mask on, Danda is still just Danda. So just cough up the money, okay? You don't have the right to mock the mask. Someone take him to a good hospital! Yeah! THREE DAYS LATER -Oh, good morning! -Good morning! Danda? KAWAMURA Morning. DANDA Why did he ignore me? What's with you? Why won't you answer? Teacher! Let me teach them a lesson. Kito! That's enough! Because people like you exist, the mask is necessary! Your earrings and dyed hair is the mask for your weakness. And without your mask, you can't even survive! Aren't you just afraid of the mask? What? Danda! Kito! Who said I was Danda? Who are you? You're not Danda? What's so funny?! They're all guys that Kito bullied. You don't have to force them to take it off. Thanks to the mask, Danda came back to school after two months. And maybe even Mizuki might come with a mask. It's not that simple as a teacher. If you want them to take it off, just pull it off forcefully. But if someone gets hurt, it'll become a problem. Could you convince him? You went to the same middle school as Danda, right? Yeah… -Koyo! Fight! Fight! Fight! -Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! School is a scary place. Once you're branded a wuss, you're bullied forever. That's why we wear the mask. Since no one knows your identity, you're free to do as you want. Isn't it brilliant? Hey… If you wear a mask, you can be reborn. I could never take it off now. Try it and you'll understand. You'll realize that the person you've always been was a lie. Hey, what made you start wearing it? Tonomura told me about it in an email. Tonomura? Did his personality change because of the mask, too? Hey, when's Tonomura's party? It's tonight. Hey, let's go! What? Are you serious? Hey… This place looks bad. Unbelievable… Don't scare me! I was the one who was scared! Let's leave. Hey, let's go home. This place is nuts! Yo! I've been waiting. You're… Tonomura? I've changed, right? It's all because of the mask. I threw my old self away. Let's go. Do a deep kiss! Them too. Looks fun, huh? Let's do it together! It'll be fine if you put these on. Because no one knows who anyone is. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. You'll get used to it. What are you thinking? Pervert! Idiot! MASK WORKSHOP MASKS FOR SALE MASK WORKSHOP Is this a mask shop? That's a nice mask. You, too? Do you want a mask? No, not me. Take it. Yuki? What are you doing? We're going! Don't push! Jeez! 48 students now! They all look the same and you can't tell them apart! What will people think of our school?! Why did you start this fad, Danda?! He didn't mean to start a fad… Right, Danda? Excuse me, I'm Danda. Danda?! Then who are you? Danda, sir. Cut it out! Just take that mask off already! Is there a rule against masks? The school provides the same uniform. Aren't these uniforms like masks? Who the hell are you?! Danda. Promiscuous pop star rumors? Give me a break! Of course it's fake! Who's this old guy? A reporter for the Weekly Hopper, Yaba. We're related. He's been rejected by a few women, so he's pissed off lately. I hear you, idiot! That's just a rumor on the internet, right? I'm busy with a youth-culture interview! So Yuki, what's after that at this "Mask Academy"? It's incredible! More kids are wearing masks every day. But high-school trends sure are weird. Now it's masks. Designer Ken Daimon, the pride of Japan presents his first collection in three years. Masks! The masked model is Hiroko, who made her debut in Milan… That Daimon, taking advantage of some kids' trend. You're making an article about it too. Right? Who are you? Mitsugu. Oh, you're Mitsugu. Yeah. What? He looks like that guy at the mask shop… What? Don't be stupid! And I'm not interested in him! -He won't take it off! -He doesn't listen anymore! He was so well-behaved. -But he gets violent! -Please ban them! I told you! We need to ban those damn masks! Yes, yes. I see. You see… Oh, well… Shall we have a staff meeting? Today, at the school courtyard of Tawara West Public High School, a body of a boy, who is presumed to have jumped off the roof, was found. We have a reporter on-site. Reporting on-site. The now-deceased Tonomura Shuji committed suicide after a teacher forcibly removed his mask. There is criticism about the school's handling of masks. We spoke with Jonouchi Yuichiro, a clinical psychologist whose experimental mask therapy draws on Jung's theory of the persona. JONOUCHI People constantly live in fear of the eyes of others. This boy, who committed suicide, was a victim of bullying, so his fear was all the greater. ON THE INCIDENT He needed the mask to hide his existence from others. Taking his mask from him in public that way would be like exposing him naked to a crowd. It would have been very, very traumatic. What Hiroko began has gone beyond fashion. It is a social phenomenon. Was it really suicide? Tonomura got bullied a lot in middle school. I doubt he had any friends. It's all because of the mask. I threw my old self away. He wouldn't die if they took it off. So he was killed? By whom? Mask hunters. Mask hunters? Those who fear the mask eventually begin the mask hunt. I saw it on a mask-supporting website. "D"? What's "D"? The mask-chat administrator. "The mask saves humans from inequality." "When humans put on the mask, they obtain freedom for the first time." "Humans cannot live without the mask." Let me see. The mouse too. "Who is Administrator D?" SEND "Who is Administrator D?" "D is for Devil." "D is for Doctor, who heals the heart." "D is for Death." "About the boy who committed suicide, Tonomura, do you know anything?" "For he, who was sacrificed for society, D will hold a memorial service tonight. At D Building." Alright. For this martyr's sake as well, we must defend the mask! That's right! Exactly! Yeah! How can those who live bare-faced understand our suffering?! That's right! I can't live without the mask! -Do your best! -You can do it! I can't forgive those who tore Tonomura's mask from his face! -That's right! -Exactly! -Yeah! Hey! It's Hiroko! It's Hiroko! That's Hiroko! You're right. But what is she doing here? Everyone… As fellow lovers of the mask… let us rise above this tragedy. Hiroko! All of us who love the mask are united by the mask. Hey, you're Danda, right? You are Hiroko. Did you talk with Tonomura before he died? It is not just Tonomura who died. It's me, Mitsugu! I want to know who D is. This is… Who's Danda? I think you've got the wrong guy. …everyone… That's enough. Tonomura might have been murdered! Don't be stupid! -It was suicide! -What are you saying, you idiot?! Run! Quick! Thanks! Where? Here! Who are you? Are you the one spreading lies? Hey! No, stop! Don't touch me! Who sent you?! We won't forgive you! Whoa… Hey! You bastard! -Get on! -What? Quick! You're the mask maker. Yeah. Why was I attacked? Because you said he was killed. They don't want it reported as a mask hunting. It doesn't suit the mask addicts if it's not a suicide. Why were you there? I'm afraid. Someone died because of the mask I made. It felt like something worse was going to happen. You're that model, right? You mean Toshi? Your name is Toshi? They say we look alike, but I'm not him. I'm Dojima Akira. Oh. Right. You don't look like you'd fit into a world of glitz, Dojima. What's your name? I'm Kawamura Yuki. Why can't we ban the masks? Avoiding the problem just makes things worse for the school! What if we ban masks and the same thing as West High happens here? Those masked kids are victims of bullying! We have a duty to protect those students who wear masks! Or it'll be our school that the media will be all over! When people are born, they can't choose their environment. Your country, era, parents, appearance, abilities… It's unfair from the beginning. Fashion, in a way, is a weapon against this unfairness. Platforms can make you taller. A dark tan can make you look Black. If you want to change your looks, you can have plastic surgery. I know why people would want to wear a mask like me. We want to be different. What bullshit! They're using the mask fad to sell themselves! But it turns out, she really could be the start of it. Regardless of gender or age… I looked into that "D" Building. The owner is Deguchi Daizo. The exec who runs the agency Hiroko works for. A hustler. They say that say he started this to make Hiroko famous and revive the Daimon brand. I got it! D stands for Deguchi Daizo! He set up the fad on the internet, and had Tonomura give a party there! You fool. The D could stand for the designer Ken Daimon, too. What about his daughter, Hiroko Daimon? That would explain her being at the memorial. You see, it's certainly convenient that she wears a mask. They say some fake Hirokos are appearing at a few events. So the Hiroko at the memorial might have been a fake? We ask everyone at today's preview to join our staff and models and wear a mask. Upon entry… Hey! Deguchi's here! Does Hiroko know about the fakes? I said I'd respond to that at a later interview. When will her face be made public? That's our trade secret! She's a mask model! What do you think about the recent popularity of plastic surgery? -Excuse me. -Deguchi! You haven't answered anything! Hold on a minute! Why is a popular model suddenly refusing interviews? Jeez! We're wasting our time here. But won't there at least be lots of food? Food at a fashion show? Idiot! This way, please. This is the cue sheet. She's probably the one who was at the memorial. What's wrong?! Rika! Hang in there! Hey! Hey, Rika! -Is she dead?! -She's dead? Why? Sugawara! There's no need to get a statement from me, right? Don't complain, Yaba! It's an unusual case, as everyone had a mask on! For now, you're all suspects. You wasted so much of my time and yet, you don't tell me a damn thing! Next, Kawamura Yuki, please! You're really sure you don't know this girl? Yes. -How did it go? Are you okay? -Next, Ota Yuko, please. Oh! What? That's Danda from my class. Oh, the guy who started the mask thing at your school? Yeah. I guess Danda came, too. For a mask wimp, he's got a pretty girlfriend. Danda! Still as unfriendly as always. But why was he at a press showing? He was at the memorial too, right? Danda's initial is also D… No way. He wouldn't do something like that. That doesn't matter. Because a mask can turn a personality a full 180 degrees… Dojima… Hey! Yuki! What's with her? Yaba! This might be murder! I know that! Come with me a minute. Where's Yuki? It's fine. Come on! At around 2 P.M., in the event hall in Mitsuhashi, Shinagawa Ward, at fashion designer Ken Daimon's fashion show, model Nakata Rika, unexpectedly died. The Higashiyama Police Department announced earlier that the cause of death was an acute heart failure brought upon by Tanrin, which was coated onto the mask. The organophosphate Tanrin is a common ingredient found in industrial pesticides. It is thought to have vaporized under the hot set lights and became toxic. Nakata Rika attended the same high school as Tonomura Shuji who committed suicide. The police are investigating whether this death is connected to Tonomura's death. MASK WORKSHOP Liar! I saw you. You were at the show. Second row, right side… So it was you. You noticed? You were staring at Toshi the entire time. I saw you from the lighting booth. The lighting booth? I was checking the lighting effects on the masks. Checking the lighting effects? Were the masks at that show yours too? That's incredible! A world-famous designer acknowledges you! I haven't been acknowledged. I'm a stand-in for my father. This workshop is my grandfather's. Your dad's a real craftsman! But a lousy father. He'd spend all day obsessed, brooding over his masks. He could only answer my mother's complaints with violence. And soon she became strange… and jumped off a roof. After my mother's death, the young me became the target of my father's beatings. Sometimes, it scares me… that my father's blood runs in me. Honestly, I feel relieved that he's in the hospital. Hey… I thought of something good. Do you want an assistant? Yuki! Crazy news! Nakata Rika and Tonomura went to mask-parties together! They were connected! Last night, Yaba and I went to Tonomura's and asked to see his computer. He sent Nakata Rika this email two days before he died! "I might be killed by D"?! D is the killer after all. We've got to find out who it is. Help! Show us! Just a little look! I'm not her! Stop! Let me go! -What are they doing? -Help! Apparently, it's a game called "Find Mizuki." Someone found her student ID on the ground. So they figured she's at school in a mask. Stop… That's cruel. In the end, those guys also do whatever they want to the weak. -Are you okay? -They're awful! Are you okay? DANDA MIZUKI Pretending to be victims by wearing masks! How honorable. That's Danda's girlfriend. I saw her at the station! What?! That Danda has a girlfriend?! Get away! -Where?! -Where are you?! Do you know the story of a mask bringing back the dead? No. Are you bringing someone back now, Dojima? My father… in order to get the young me to make masks… "Make one of your mother." He said that and I got so caught up in making it beautiful. I realized I was obsessed with making masks, too. But you can live without the mask. You're strong. That's not true. At times, I want the mask's power. But it won't work with me. They say it makes you free to speak. But I… My little sister Reika… She's weak, like me. BULLYING VICTIMS TAKE REVENGE ANONYMOUS SOCIETY MASKED GANGS THE PERSONALITIES HIDDEN BEHIND MASKS The hell? What an idiot! MASK PHENOMENON SPREADS UNSEEABLE "FACE" Do we condemn masks as evil simply because it was reported a few times at some crime scenes? JONOUCHI YUICHIRO The cities are full of masks. Maybe people who just don't like them are just blaming everything on them. Dojima! Are you all right? Oh no! You're bleeding! Even if, and I say if, there are violent masked gangs, it is wrong to blame masks! There was violence long before masks became popular. Listen! 99.9 percent of violent acts are committed by people without masks! It's wrong to blame them. The wearing of a mask is a basic human right! So is this what "Mask Academy" has come to? And, where's Yuki? Helping Dojima at the Mask Workshop. Huh? So, have you found anything new? The deceased Nakata Rika was being stalked by Danda. That's what the masked model Hiroko told the police. Yeah? Sugawara? Is Danda Toru here? I want to talk to him. Is he not here? I can charge you all… for concealing a criminal. Do you understand? Concealing a criminal! Well?! -Concea… -Run! Halt! All of you! Hey! Hey! Yajiri! Stay with the car! Hey! Get off! Yaba! No pictures! No pictures! Stop that! Discovered in the deceased male student's pocket was a note in which he admitted and apologized for the murders of Nakata Rika and Tonomura Shuji. He describes how he obtained Tanrin from his father's chemical firm. Thus, we believe this closes the case of the mask murders. Will the officers who let a suspect escape to commit suicide face disciplinary action? In regards to that, the department is investigating. That's not it! The deceased male student had romantic intentions for Nakata Rika. He killed Tonomura, Nakata's boyfriend and her as well when she spurned his advances. In other words, the motive was this high-school love triangle. That's all. W-Wait a minute! What? But why would he do that? Danda had a pretty girlfriend. Yeah, they were definitely more than friends. Hiroko said he was a stalker. If Hiroko is D, the police are playing right into her hands! Anyone can print a suicide note. I got to D's page. THE MASK IS THE TRUE GOD THE FUTURE OF THE MASK HAS BEEN SECURED D is still alive. That's all, right? Sorry. That's fine. You're hurt. It's my turn to help you. I'll be back then. Excuse me. Who are you? I'm Dojima's assistant. I brought the masks. -Who said you could come in? -What? Leave the masks and get out. Daimon! A model's fallen ill and has collapsed! We can't get another one in time for the shoot. What's one less? It's just photos for a pamphlet anyway! Anyway? My pamphlets are my works of art as well! One less model will ruin the symmetry. Find another one! But there isn't time! Um… What? You're still here? Yes… I was thinking perhaps I might be able to help… -Okay, all done. -Thank you. Hurry, everyone! Excuse me. This is Yuki. She's filling in as an emergency model. How do you do. Get her ready, okay? Um, I'd like to say hello to Hiroko! No way you could see her. Hiroko's face is top secret. So no one's seen her face? Your masks are here. Don't get them mixed up! This way please. -Thank you. -Thank you. Good luck. Yuki, that's yours. Yuki! Yes! Toshi, be a chair. JONOUCHI YUICHIRO PSYCHOTHERAPY INSTITUTE Suddenly Dad started shouting, and kicked Mom in the stomach! And you, I mean, Toshi, was where? Me? Where were you? In the closet. Because Mom told me to hide! -It wasn't your fault, Toshi. -It was my fault! Akira… keeps telling me that, over and over and over! It's not your fault! Akira is misunderstanding. All right, Toshi… Could you call Akira for me? Toshi? It's Akira. Oh, Akira… Did you talk to Toshi? Yes. I did. Take off… this thing. I'm leaving. People live behind invisible masks. The mask of a student, the mask of a salaryman… the mask of virtue. "When humans put on the mask, they obtain freedom for the first time." The mask has the power to free your soul. The popularity of the mask proves that my therapy is valid. So… You have problems with your parents? My parents? A common reason to seek masks is the fear of people. The condition… is conspicuous in people who lack stable family ties. My previous patient… suffered violence from his father after his mother committed suicide. He needed two personalities… One with the mask, one without. "The mask is a gospel that saves humans from inequality." I heard that before Hiroko debuted, she underwent Doctor Jonouchi's mask therapy. Her mother, Sayaka, was a model who was driven to suicide by her husband Daimon. Hiroko grew up under the cruel abuse of her father. That left her psychologically unstable. His daughter's mask therapy gave Daimon and also Deguchi the idea of the mask fad. And Jonouchi's job was to advertise it. But who exactly is Hiroko? Her face isn't made public and we can't find any photos. Hey… Is that even her? Got it! Deguchi, Daimon, Hiroko… and the Doctor! We have one more candidate for D. Isn't there more? The guy who makes the masks who was also at the memorial. Dojima is suspicious enough to be D. I don't know your intentions, but if you-- But he rescued me! Why him? Then why did he hide that he's Toshi? Well… that's… He's the most suspicious! You're wrong! Hey! Yuki! Tell me the truth. Dojima, you're Toshi, right? Why did you hide it from me? Are you hiding anything else? Do you suspect me? Of course not! I… -I want to believe you, Dojima. -I haven't done anything. Believe it or not. Then explain it to me in words. I'm on your side, Dojima. I know why you put on a mask and become Toshi. You hate living like your father, and you want to… What would you know? Running away won't help! Will you hide behind a mask your whole life? Stop it! That hurts! Stop it! Stop it! It was the masked students! What in the world? Are you okay? They're crazy! Teacher! Kuroiwa and the others are attacking the masked students! Saying it's revenge for Kito, but they're after them all! Don't mock us! Hey! The mask hunt has finally started. To make someone like Tonomura seem threatening… The mask's power really scares me. What are you thinking about, Yuki? I'm sorry about before. I want to talk. Wait, Yuki! It's like you said. I couldn't stand the thought of being like my father… so I put on a mask named Toshi. But it was a lie. I'm over it now. I wanted to break the spell of the mask… but I couldn't face my empty self without it. I was scared of the wounds I hid with the mask, so I tried to run from reality. Your words opened my eyes. I've made up my mind. I'll expose D and sins of the mask… and bid farewell to the mask. Dojima, that's the first time you opened up to me. It's always been like you were wearing an invisible mask. I feel like I'm seeing the real Dojima now. Leave it to me. I'll expose D for you. I've got a great idea. Alright… People from the shop, this way please. No time. -Good morning. -Morning. 500! Try lowering two decibels. Good morning! 630! Can you raise the volume? Okay! Please check… Why were they staring at you? What did you do? I thought I'd scare them. I sent them a threatening e-mail. A threat? To Deguchi, Daimon, Jonouchi and Hiroko. If D is one of them, they'll definitely try something. Great idea, right? You're challenging D? You could die. If I'm invited up on the roof, you'll come with me. What about poison on your mask? Protect me from that, too. Why didn't you stop her? She'll be killed! To hell with your broken heart! But Yuki has Dojima with her. But Dojima is the most suspicious! What? I got a shot of Hiroko from Milan. The real Hiroko is probably at the Mask Workshop. Dojima is the one hiding Hiroko! No way! But why? Hiroko went crazy when her mother committed suicide. And when Jonouchi treated her she met Dojima! They had the same kind of problems, and Dojima helped her disappear. That "sister" Yuki talked about is probably the real Hiroko! Dojima's got Yuki fooled! So Dojima… …is D! Doesn't that make sense? If I were Dojima, I'd kill Yuki. She's threatened the others, so the police will suspect those four. He kills one of them, and makes it look like a suicide, just like Danda. No one suspects him. He's free and clear. Yuki… STOP Yuki! This way, please. Act 1, standing by. Whoa. Act 1, standing by. Okay. We're on! …under the hot set lights… …became toxic. Huh? Dojima? Yuki, what's wrong? Nothing. Mitsugu?! Hey! What are you sleeping here for?! Just get in! Turn it up. Sound and lights! More! Okay. Yuki! Yuki… It's all right. She's not dead. Mitsugu! What happened? Dojima! You're D, aren't you? No. D is… you. I made that mask for you. You switched it with Yuki's when I was away from the stage. What? To prevent the same crime, All the masks but Hiroko's were being kept under lock and key. The only way to get a poisoned mask on her was to fix another one… and switch it. Enough! You guys, go backstage. Where's your proof? All the masks in Act 3 are the same. That's true. But I know the masks' expressions. They may look the same, but they all have subtle differences. Dojima… Your theory makes sense. But even so, there's no proof that Hiroko did that. Why would Hiroko want to kill anyone? She wanted to be Hiroko. Right? Wanted to be Hiroko? So who's this in front of you? It's Hiroko herself! We won't know that until she takes off the mask. The real Hiroko looks like this. You…! I'm Hiroko. Why now…? Reika! What's that scar? I hated being your daughter. As my debut drew nearer, the thought that I'd be made famous as your daughter was so depressing. So I ran away. It takes deep wounds of the soul to scar the face your parents gave you. That's enough. It's all right. I've also made up my mind. If I'd spoken up earlier, none of this would have happened. I didn't want to hurt my career as a model, so I kept quiet. But if I don't cut ties with you, I'll never accomplish anything. You fool of a daughter. This brand is finished. Hey! Take off that stupid mask already! You can't be Hiroko! I guess not. You! Danda's girlfriend! He forced me to go out with him. He found out who I was. Just when I'd managed to become someone different, he… Don't tell me… I was finally free of being tormented at school. That's why… It was fine if he got punished. Are you Mizuki? MIZUKI Seriously? You can buy appearance with money however much you want. As long as the real one didn't show up… I could've been Hiroko. And when Tonomura Shuji and Nakata Rika found out your secret… Nobody move! "MASKED KILLER" HIROKO'S FACE "The real HIROKO was someone else!!" Thank you. Huh? A rock star's pyramid scheme?! What do you mean, get right on it?! Hello?! But I just gave you a scoop… MASK WORKSHOP You had me fooled. I was sure she was your sister. I'm glad you're free of the mask. Like hell! What about Yuki's feelings after how much she went through?! She almost got killed! She did all that and it's all for Hiroko? It's unacceptable! I understand. Dojima, if you really like Yuki… It's all right. I can make it on my own now. Thank you. Just a minute. Why are you two talking for me? Don't be stupid! I just teamed up with Dojima to find out who killed my classmate. How does that turn into this? What? It's because you say weird things, Mitsugu. You gave Hiroko the wrong idea. Take care now. Dojima… Goodbye. Hey! Hey! I guess we should go, too. Hey… Hey, Yuki! What? Use this. Stupid! What's so funny? Kito, the days of the mask is over. Subtitle translation by Ian MacDougall
