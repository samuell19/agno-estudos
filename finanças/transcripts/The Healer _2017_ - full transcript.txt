Darling? - You're back? - Yeah, it's a long story. Coming! Just give me a minute. Don't come in here, I have a surprise. Mm, surprise? - Hi. - Hi. Two flights cancelled, sent me home early for the weekend. After a ten-hour wait. And what's with this surprise? Well, I forgot your birthday last month... - Right. - ...and... All done. Should just take a couple of hours to connect. If you've got problems, you give me a call, yeah? Connect what? R34 chip, second generation, on your plasma TV. She not tell you? Gets you all the Premier League matches and five Champions League first round games. Oh, and I threw in a couple more things on me, but, um, just don't tell anyone I did that, yeah? See ya! Oh, my God! How great are you? Yes! My shoe! Thank you! Thank you! ...a crap about your business! It's not my damn problem! You tell him, if money is not here by Friday, I'm closing this stupid store! Healer my arse! - What did he want this time? - Damn it, Alec. - He's going to close the store. - No, he's not. Relax. And what the hell happened yesterday? You left and never came back! Uh, yeah, sorry. I, uh... I got caught up... You're the one that fixes the stuff. If you're not here, how do we make money? - Forty quid? Is that all we got? - You are not betting that money. - Oh, go on, lend me ten more. - No, Alec! Please! It's one horse, one race. OK? I've got a winner, I've done it before. And you've lost everything before! It's seven to one and no one knows he runs like the wind. - It's the last time. - That's it. - I quit. - Come on, Amir, don't do this... Amir! Look, I don't know what's happened to you, Alec. You've changed. You're a good man, but... you need some help. I'm fine! I can fix... Amir! Where's your other shoe? I'm Alec Bailey. I got a phone call from you. Yes, right this way. I imagine you must have been quite surprised to get our call about meeting today. - Yeah, I, uh... - Seeing as you bounced five checks when you had your account here. Not to mention your Visa, which had to be cancelled twice because you've managed somehow to keep ramping up charges. Look, I paid all that off so... Why am I here? There is someone who is willing to eradicate all your debts. Is this a joke? It should be. It's not. Right. Who is this person? A family member. Ah! Family member. Right. Well, both my parents are long dead, as is my only brother, and the last I heard of a relative was at my first communion, so how are you gonna explain that? Well this is an uncle you've never met. - That's convenient. - Mr. Raymond Heacock. Yeah. That's my mother's maiden name. Hmm. Well, he will be at his private club. Table under his name, today at 1:00 p.m. Sharp. Ah! Thank you, Svetlana. Alec! Sit down! Hungry? - Uh... a little, yeah. - Good. I've ordered you the escargot and the sole. They do it well here. He won't be having any. Thank you. You must be curious. Ask away. - You're my uncle? - Indeed. Your dear mother was my sister. Then how come I've never heard of you? Sadly, we rarely spoke. There were a couple of things we couldn't agree on. Such as? That one I'm not prepared to answer. Um... The bank said that you're... gonna give me all this money? Well, that's not exactly right. - Can I be open with you? - Sure. Frankly, you're a disgrace to the family. You've a gambling habit... ...that'll either get you killed or, at the very least, maimed. You've never married and you're sleeping around as if you've just discovered your willy. As for your engineering degree, well, your business is a disaster. What am I doing here? Look, I am prepared to pay off all your debts. Every single one of them. Which, at this moment in time, amount to exactly... eighty-eight-thousand, nine-hundred-and-fifty pounds. So, you see? It's not all bad. Of course, I'll want something in exchange. What? I want you to move abroad, leave England. Leave England? Where? You'll be living in Nova Scotia. That's Canada, if you don't know where it is. Why? Well, we've had family living there for the past 200 years and, frankly, well, we're getting a bit thin on the ground. It's a tradition I want to maintain. Napkin! Thank you. Three-hundred and sixty-five days. Not a day less. And then, if you're not happy, well, you can always return to England and pick up your debauched life where you left off. Oh, by the way, you'll be leaving Monday. That's in two days! Yes. Hopefully your friends won't kill you by then. Now, here's your ticket for Halifax. You'll be met at the airport by a man named Frederick. He's worked for me for a number of years. He looks after my house, where you'll be staying. Now, there's work papers and a visa that lasts a year. - What am I supposed to do there? - Could always try working. - Doing what? - Not my problem, dear boy. So, Monday, 13:05, your plane leaves. Be on it, or the deal is off. Ah, I really must go. Enjoy your meal, it's all paid for. I'm really sorry about your brother. Such a shame. Oh, by the way, Alec... Ever noticed anything strange about yourself? Odd? Odd? Never mind. Good luck. Thanks. So, I say, you get the plane ticket, get it refunded... Should be close to what you owe those Russians. And tell your uncle to bugger off. The hell's wrong with you? I'm not gonna rob my uncle. Only just met him. Besides, he's like the only family I've got. You checked, right? - Can't get it refunded. - Yeah, I checked. But that's besides the point. I'm not gonna go to Canada. This is ridiculous. I reckon if Charlie was here, he'd tell you to go... You don't talk about my brother. Alright, mate. I'm serious, you don't talk about Charlie. OK, I'm sorry. Shit... So, Alec... We are drinking beer with friends, huh? It means... you have the money for Mr. Misic? Leave him alone, alright? He's gonna get you your bloody money! Shit! Alec playing games... - Tell me your sins, my son. - Jesus Christ! We'll have to add those to whatever else you confess. No, just... I'm just hiding here, OK? This is a sacred sacrament, get out! No, please, they're gonna kill me. - Who wants to harm you? - Nobody. Just... just lower your voice! - Now tell me what you've done. - I owe them money. - Which you stole? - No! I gambled it. Wait, wait, wait... Ladies and gentlemen, we have to close now. This is the house of the Lord. I don't believe either one of you is praying, so... go about your business elsewhere, please. - Thanks. - Stay for a while. Those men aren't going to go away just like that. Come here and tell me what is going on with you. Maybe I can give you some advice. - Look, father. I just... - Sit down! You owe me this at least. Sit and talk. It seems your life is not going well, is it? I think you should move to Canada. I think it's God's way of giving you a second chance. Trust me, my uncle doesn't work for God. - Let me tell you a story. - No. Please, Father, I'm gonna go. There was this parish priest in a church and the rain was so bad for months that the town was flooding. And people were forced to leave. But the priest said, "God will save me!" So he stayed behind. Now, when the water was up to his waist, they sent him the police to evacuate him and then they sent in the firemen, and the army with a boat, and always, he refused, believing that God would be the one to save him. And so, he drowned. And when he come face-to-face with God, he complained, he said, "God, why did you abandon me?" And God said, "I sent the police! And the firemen! And even the army with a boat, but still you would not listen." I think God sent your uncle. Go to Canada. Ah, there you are! That's... That's me. I'm Frederick. Welcome to Nova Scotia. So... uh, are you from Nova Scotia? Yeah. And how long have you known my uncle? Forty-three years. Wow. I only just met him. So, there's a few things about this house you should know. Sometimes, the furnace breaks down. Let me know if it does, but don't kick it. Fridge is not great, but your food won't spoil. You've got one phone. Washer is in the back. Don't overload it, it'll flood. Bed's made, it's a bit squeaky, you'll get used to that. Fresh linen and towels in the closet. Got any questions? - Yeah. Is there any internet? - No. Oh. Where is the nearest town? Lunenburg, about four kilometers east. How am I supposed to get there? Well, your uncle asked me to find you a car. An old fishing buddy of mine sold me his truck. Should be delivered in the morning. - Oh, great, thank you. - Yeah, thank me when you see it. Wait, wait... How am I supposed to reach you? I'll be around. Number's on the wall. Oh, I guess this is me... for a year. You've gotta be kidding me. Jesus... Nice car! I hope you like fishing. Oh, I don't fish. This thing shouldn't be on the road. - It's not actually mine... - Fred bought it, I know. - You must be Alec? - Yeah! Hey! I'm Cecilia, I know your uncle, he told me that you might be coming. Oh, hey! Are you... jet-lagged? Um... Yeah, a bit. Buy you a coffee? Sure. - It's just around the corner. - Is that gonna be alright? Yeah! No, I don't think anyone's stealing that! It's ridiculous. What brought you all the way out here? I just... I just fancied a change, really. It was a "now or never" kind of thing, so... - What do you do? - I'm a vet. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, mostly farm animals. - Wow. - I moved here after college. - And your profession is... - I... I fix things. I'm a... I'm a mechanical engineer, so I have an uncanny ability to fix anything electrical. Really? You know what? You should put an ad in the local weekly newspaper. It's like the Bible here. Everyone reads it. Oh, yeah! I mean... That would really help me out. I kind of need the money. Uh, they're closed today because they publish tomorrow. But I could maybe get your ad squeezed in. - The editor is my neighbor. - Yeah? Yeah! Yeah. That'd be great, thank you. Alright. Hang on. OK. Um... What do you want it to say? "The Healer. Alec Bailey arrives in Lunenburg. I fix anything electrical that's broken." I'm gonna put your uncle's house as the... address. - "The Healer," I like that. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Well, I had a... shop with the same name back home, so... Oh! Hi, Cecilia. Father Malloy. This is Alec, Raymond's nephew. He just got here. - Oh! - Hey! Welcome to our community. Your uncle is a very generous man. - Is he? - Will I be seeing you at Sunday mass? No, uh... I'm actually a Buddhist. A Buddhist? Yeah. And how'd that come about? Well, just like how you found Jesus, I found Buddha. And where was that exactly? I mean, that you found him? - I found... - Father, give the man a break. He just got here. I'm just kidding. Good luck with that. - I'll see you, Cecilia. - Bye. - Are you really a Buddhist? - No. I've been to Thailand, though. So, uh... Are you married? - No, thank you. - No? Uh... no, I actually happen to like what you like. - Really? - Yeah. Wow! Uh... Well, that's... that's great. I mean, maybe I can take you for dinner, or something... No, I like women. What? Oh... You're a lesbian. Yep! That's what they call it. Sorry. I didn't, uh... Buddy, what's up? Batman, what is it? What's going on? That is so bizarre. Are you good with animals? Hey. I don't know. Well, if the fixing things doesn't work out, then you can always come work with me. I could use the help. - Yeah? - Yeah! OK. OK. Hey... No, no, no! Oh, shit! Beer. I didn't mean to. Just suddenly stopped here. Beer. I'm gonna need your license and registration. I've only just moved here. - I've been lent this truck. - I know who you are. You are... a Heacock, Raymond's nephew. Yeah! Oh, you must know my uncle. The papers are in the vehicle, yes or no? Uh... I'm giving you a citation... for parking on the side of the road with no emergency lights and for drinking and driving. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I was choking on a chip. And I don't give a royal crap. Welcome to Nova Scotia. Oh! And when you speak with your uncle, tell him Tom sends his regards. ♪ I wanna see you... ♪ Oh, my God, that's cold! Excuse me... Sorry. Um... Uh, the front door was open. I hope you don't mind. We'll just be waiting in the sitting room. What are you all doing here? The ad you placed. "The Healer"? Oh! Oh! Uh... - Give me a minute. - Alright. Right. Uh... Who's first? - We are. - Great. How can I help? Well, I have arthritis and it's getting worse each day. And my husband, well, his hearing is practically shot. So annoying. So, can you help us? Sorry. There seems to be a bit of a mistake here. But you're a healer? It says so in the ad. Oh! No, no, no... You see that... It's my con phrase. It's... it's my slogan. Um... I fix electrical things. Ad says you heal. "The Healer. Alec Bailey. Arrives in Lunenburg. I fix any..." Wait, wait... No, I didn't... I didn't say that. Well, it's printed right there. And, frankly, we were a bit surprised that, uh, you would bring it up this way. Being that it's supposed to be a secret. What, a secret? What do you mean, a secret? So, my blood sugar is off the charts. Doctors say I'm gonna need insulin at this point. I'm so sick of dieting, it does nothing! Yeah, I'm like a factory of kidney stones, man. One a month, sometimes two... I can feel one coming as of yesterday. Um... this... The ad is wrong, I can't... I'm not a healer. I don't cure people. - He doesn't wanna help us. - What? He doesn't want to help us! Why not? - Because I'm not a doctor. - What? So you're... You're not the chosen one? What? What are you talking about? Why would you lie like that, then? Look... It's a mistake, OK? A misprint. If you have anything electrical, anything at all, I'll be happy to look at it. That's what I do. My truck broke down. If someone can drive me to Cecilia's, I can clear all this up. Didn't you say you fix electrical things? Yeah. Fix your car. So unfair. I really thought my prayers had been answered. I can take you to Cecilia's... if you'll do something for me. Sure. My boyfriend's been procrastinating about asking to marry me. Just needs a little push. So, if I say something that doesn't make much sense when he's around, you just follow my lead? Yeah. I can do that. When do you want me to do that? Now. He's the one that brought me here. So, Philip, this is Alec. We go way back. How long has it been, Alec? - A while. - Gosh! Doesn't feel that way. It's amazing how, for a woman, first impressions with a man are just so important. I was lucky. You were so sweet, Alec. So gentle. How long are you staying? A year. A whole year? That is so great! One day, we should go swimming at the lake, like we used to. Remember that time my mom nearly caught us butt naked - and we hid for an hour... - No. No. - I don't remember that. - It's fine, Alec. Philip understands. We all have pasts. Right, hon? Sure. See you soon, Alec. So happy you're here! Call me, anytime. - Hey! - Hey. What? Nothing. They misprinted the ad. Hey, this isn't funny. I've already had four potential clients in my house: one with arthritis, one deaf, some nutjob waitress and some dude - running a kidney stone... - I am so sorry. I will have them reprint it, but it won't be out till next week. Only been here two days. I got a ticket yesterday for 250 dollars by this jerk of a policeman. What? Tom? Tom pulled you over? Tom's ex-wife had a crush on Raymond, and rumor has it, they had a thing, so Tom tries to make your uncle's life impossible - when he's here. - Great. Well, then now I'm the target, aren't I? What is it with you and animals? My dog loves you, the sheep are following us. I think you've got some strange animals. I wanted to ask you... um... I know it's cheeky, but the other day, were you serious about the job offer? - Yeah! Of course! - Great! When do I... when do I start? What do I...? Right now! I can't believe it. - What was that? - Just follow me! - Oh, my God! - What? What, what, what? This cow's been having difficulty since yesterday, in constant pain. - What's wrong with her? - She's pregnant. Um, you think she's going to lose, um... the baby? No. I think it's about to happen right now. - OK... - Giving birth? - Yeah. - I think... I think I should probably just give her some privacy. Alec, grab the gloves! Do you want a job or not? Grab the gloves! Alec, come on! OK... OK... Easy, girl. Oh my God! What are those sticks coming out of her tunnel? The legs! OK. We're gonna pull, ready? Ready? Oh, my God. Go! Come on, come on! Pull! Oh my God! Come on! Hey, little one. You know, it's... It's not usually like that... - I don't want to talk about it. - OK. It's just the way she was staring at me. I'm so sorry. - I'm so... sorry. - Seriously? I'm... You've some visitors... No, I have more clients. Mr. Bailey, can you see us now? Frank, Leslie, what's this about? My little Rebecca, Cecilia. You know what's wrong. She's nearly five and she hasn't spoken for the past year. I'm so sorry, the ad was misprinted. He isn't some kind of healer. You're not the healer? No, I fix electrical things, not people. Well, can you at least try? Leslie... I'm gonna try and fix this... I'm so sorry. I'll see you tomorrow at ten? Mm-hmm. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I'm never gonna make the year. Alec Bailey! Huh? What's he want? Alec Bailey! I want a word with you. How dare you come to this peaceful community and try to scam these people? - The hell are you talking about? - A healer? Is that the best ploy you could come up with? Look. It was a mistake, alright? They misprinted the ad! Ah! Baloney! I know how these schemes work. Now I get the whole town talking about it. Of course you say it's a mistake. What the hell are you talking about? Look, I'm telling you the ad is bullshit. Hey! Don't use foul language with me! Then listen to me and help me tell these people that I am not a healer! Paula, come on... - OK, go. - As we can see, the oak trees and forest are thick with mosses, still moist from spring... Sounds like a bad argument. Oh, and propagate your publicity? No, sir, I'm gonna report you to the authorities! Know what? Get off my property! You're giving me a headache. Your uncle'd be ashamed of you. Don't you walk away from me! - I'm talking to you. - Don't touch me! Help me... Shit! Laura, check it out. Oh, my God! Is that Father Malloy? Don't you die on me! Oh, my God! He murdered Father Malloy. - What's he doing? - He's probably gonna bury him. Dear Jesus! - Let's get out of here. - No, wait! Oh, my gosh! - That guy's an animal! - Oh, my God. I got it all on camera. Let's go see Tom! Shit! Help! Help! Help! Hey, Alec. I didn't know you were the Healer. I just saw the ad. Where's the newspaper office? I need to talk to them! And would you like the special juice of the day? - It's blackberry apple. - Oh, sure! Larry! Would you like to try the juice of the day? - It's blackberry apple. - Why are you screaming at me? That will be grand, Mary. - Larry, can you hear me? - Yeah, what is it? Larry, you got your hearing back! I think I have! And I didn't have any pain this morning. I thought it was just a lucky break. Dear Jesus! They say Leslie's daughter is like a chatterbox after they saw Alec. I'm going to get my blood tested, maybe I'm better too. You should! You all really think that he's the one? He must be the one. Would you like some coffee, hon? No, no, thanks! Hey, guys! Look, that's him! Come on, let's go! - Ah, yes! He's over there. - Where is he? - We printed what we were told! - Bullshit! Now, I need you to put a clear message in tomorrow saying you made a mistake. We don't print again until next Tuesday. Don't care! Just make an exception! Oh, my dear man! Thank you so very much! - I can hear! - I never should've doubted you. I haven't had any pain since yesterday. And Rebecca's doing so well! You are a blessing to this town! Has my blood sugar corrected itself? I don't buy this crap! There are no healers and this guy has no powers. - This is ridiculous, Mary. - Thank you! Thank you! Finally, someone with some common sense here! Oh, my God. Philip! Your stutter. It's gone! My stutter... My stutter is gone! You're not doing so bad. How much are you charging? How much do we owe you? Nothing! Nothing! You know why? Because real healers, they don't exist! Next week, he's gonna print that I am Superman, but I'm still not gonna be able to freaking fly! I just want to be left alone! But he heals people. There you are! You're almost two hours late! I've got a great excuse, OK? Do you still want me to work for you or not? - Yeah, sure. You're... - Great! Who's giving birth today? Anyone? I know you've had some bad luck since you got here. Bad luck? This place is a living nightmare. The people here are crazy! And I have this constant blistering headache and... What? It's my birthday. Happy birthday, Alec. Do you like Pinot Noir? It's really beautiful here. Oh, you finally noticed. See, it's not all bad. Thank you, for this. Happy birthday, Alec. So, do you have a girlfriend? Uh... - No, not at the moment. - No? What if you're wrong about all of this? I was thinking... You know, I... I bet if we did an experiment, you and I, - and... I like kissed you... - Oh! ...maybe you might change your mind. You don't think? Interesting, um... I think we should do an experiment before... - OK. - ...where maybe you kiss Fred... Um... ...and see if you change your mind. - Ouch, am I that bad? - Yeah! You know what is weird? What? Rebecca, that couple's child, has started talking after she met you. From what I hear, you're having - some sort of effect on people. - No... It's just people in this town... They are just looking for an excuse to wake up from their boring existence and find miracles where there are none. That little girl was about to speak, I know it. Alec Bailey, we have you surrounded. Get down on your knees with your hands behind your head. Tom? Is that you? Cecilia! Cecilia, get away from him, he's dangerous! Alec, Alec, get down on your knees with your hands behind your head. I won't tell you again, get down on your knees. It's a ticket, I'll pay it! Are you insane? - Oh my God! - I thought I had the safety on. Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? Alec Bailey, you're under arrest for the murder of Father Malloy. Anything that you say will be held against you - in a court of law. - What? I didn't kill anyone! He had a heart attack and I left him at the church. You're one cynical bastard. We have the whole thing on videotape, Cecilia. He killed him and now he's probably buried him somewhere. He walked on his own two feet into the church! - He's gotta be somewhere, Tom! - We have an eyewitness, we have video footage of him pounding on the poor man. Where's the body? There's no body! He's out there, just go and find him! Father Malloy is nowhere to be found. Are you that stupid? I mean, even his car is still at your property. Cecilia! I didn't do anything. Find Father Malloy, Cecilia. I'm innocent! Now... what do we have here? What is... what is that? It's a shovel. - What's he doing? - Now listen up. He's probably gonna bury him. You tell me, at the end of it, if you think that Father Malloy is still alive. I got it all on camera. Let's go see Tom. Yeah... Wow! - Thanks. - No, not... Listen, there has to be some sort of logical explanation. - The man's not an assassin. - Then where's the priest? He took the body, he put in the back of this truck and he took it somewhere. I mean, this man is a sick cruel bastard, and you are just lucky that he didn't hurt you too. What's gonna happen to him? NSPD is coming down to pick him up in the morning. - This is major. - Let me talk to him. Please, Tom. Please, let me talk to him. Five minutes and don't you dare get close. Five. Did you find him? No. I've looked for him everywhere. Fred's looking too. What's gonna happen to me? They're taking you to a Halifax prison. - Did you speak to a lawyer? - No! I don't want a lawyer! - This is serious, Alec. - I didn't do anything. He had a heart attack at my house, I managed to get him in the truck, I drove him to town and then he... he woke up. And he walked into the church! - What? - I just watched the video. Father Malloy looks very dead. Yeah! Tell me about it! He freaked me out! I thought... - You don't believe me, do you? - I do, I do. It's just so implausible. What? He would just get up - and walk away after all that? - Yes, he did. I believe you, Alec. I'm just trying to have... Just get out! What? I will find Father Malloy. You want a shovel? So, you... wanna use the bathroom before I lock up for tonight? Yeah. Father Malloy... was my very good friend. They're here! Tom! Hey, Pete! - How you doing? - Good. And you? Good, good, good. Who would have thought you'd have any of this going on in Lunenburg, huh? The guy's from Britain, is he? Yeah. Just arrived. Yeah, still haven't figured out where he buried the body. No, we'll find the body. We have Al Capone here, he's the best dog I got, let me tell you. This boy will sniff out things other dogs only dream to find. Hey, am I free to go? - Freeze! - Whoa! Hands on your head now! - I'll spray the shit out of you! - OK, OK. How'd you get free and get out? The door was open, my cuffs were loose! - Bullshit! - Let Al Capone go. Get him, boy. Go get him. Get him, boy. Get him, boy. Lunenburg Police. Henry, grab the dog. - Tom... - Damn it! Not now, Jim. I need you to get on the ground slowly or I will put a bullet - through your head! - Tom, I'm sorry, but it's Father Malloy on the phone for you. - I told you! - Shut up and don't move! Who is this? But we... we saw a video where you were... Right. - What the hell you done, Tom? - Thank you. He's... innocent. Oh, my God. That was Father Malloy calling to confirm it, and he's fine. What the hell's wrong with all of you? I told you I was innocent! What... the hell... have you done now, Tom? You saw the video. I mean, there was no way he was still alive. We all saw the video, Tom. What are you, Steven Spielberg now? OK, but... There's more footage, I mean... Look! Watch this! - Let's go, Henry! - Pete! Don't waste my time again, Tom. You, uh... want a coffee with one of those little cookies you like? Shut up. Father Malloy! Where the hell were you? They put me in jail thinking you were dead! I know, I'm sorry. I came as soon as I heard. Well, you didn't come soon enough, did you? I'm sorry for... not believing in you. Wait! What? I have a confession to make. I lost my faith about two years ago. I actually... stopped believing that God could exist. Wait... Wait, and you accuse me of lying to these people? I didn't have the heart to tell the community, so I just kept... playing my role... which is what I was, the priest. That's pathetic. But I died yesterday. I'm sure of it. And nothing should have brought me back and yet... Look, when I moved to Lunenburg, I heard stories... Rumors, healers... I just dismissed it as... nonsensical myths. - Wait, wait... - I... I believe... you have a gift. A God-given gift which brought me back and gave me a second chance. Are you... Are you serious? I got my faith back, I wanna thank you for that. Alec. Son, there's no denying it... You are a healer. And I'm done. I am done. You are... You're all clinically insane here. I'm... "There's a room you haven't seen: the basement. This is the key to the house." "One for sorrow, two for joy. Three for a girl, four for a boy. Five for silver, six for gold. Seven for a secret never to be told." This is the key to the house? It's your destiny. - Hello, Alec. - It's you. We need to talk. It's a lot to take in. What the hell's going on here? Why'd you have my name on the wall? - Calm down! - Don't tell me to calm down! What is this place? Who are these people? These are your ancestors. That one there, behind you, was the last one chosen. It's my father. Is this some kind of religious sect? You have the family gift, the gift of healing. - It skips a generation. - Oh, my God! - You're all insane! - Alec, since you've been here, you've helped a young girl find her speech, - an old man, his hearing... - It wasn't me! Father Malloy died and is back. I've seen the video. But I... I didn't do anything. I... I didn't even touch those people. You don't have to touch them. If you are nearby, and someone's meant to be cured, then they will be. Like it or not, you've been chosen. - Who chose me? - Whatever you want to call it. The Big Chief, Mr. Creator, the Supreme Being... God? Well, that's the more popular name. I don't believe in God. Pick another name. The headaches are part of it, but they'll go away. Why don't we go outside and get some fresh air, Alec? No, no, stay away from me. Welcome to the family, Alec. Hey... Hey, are you OK? Yeah. I had a nightmare, I think. No... Wait. - What's going on? - It wasn't a dream. Everything Raymond told you is true. You knew about all this? Throughout all the healers, Cecilia's family has always been among the few who knew. Our two families are connected. Why me? I thought it was worth the shot. If it wasn't to be you, at least I would've helped you. Help me? You gave me two days! The gift can only be activated per se, when the chosen one is here... and on his 30th birthday. I just turned 30. Alec, have you recently noticed that animals are fascinated with you? This morning, when you were detained, how did you get out? The handcuffs, they were loose. The door just opened... It is written, "The healer will not be bound by any man, he will be free." But we made up the name for the shop in London: The Healer. Yes. That was a bit strange... but possibly more than a coincidence. Oh, and the ad in the paper? Was that also a coincidence? No, I misprinted it that on purpose. - Why would you do that? - I did what I had to do, Alec. Do I have a choice in any of this? Yes, yes, you do. Tonight, the day after your birthday, you must decide. Unless you reject the gift before midnight, - it is bound to you for life. - Well, I don't want it. Alec, you could help so many people... I don't want anything to do with this! Alec, listen. This is what we're gonna do. We'll leave you to think about it. You've got about six hours. We'll be back before midnight. And then what? You'll sacrifice a goat and bathe me in its blood, is that right? That's always an option. No, Alec. Midnight will come, and if you decide to accept, we'll open a good bottle of wine to celebrate it. What do you think? I think it went quite well. It's nearly midnight. I don't want it. I never chose any of this. Alec, I think that you're making a mistake. Well, that's my final answer. You know what? Charlie would've wanted it. Don't you dare talk about my brother! Why not? It's the truth. He should've been the next healer. He had a sense of responsibility. Responsibility? He didn't even know you existed! And where were you when my mother died? Huh? I loved my sister. - I just couldn't show myself. - That's bullshit! We keep it secret until the time is right. - That's the way it works. - This is how it works on my end. I'm not gonna play Harry Potter for you both. So what happens now? I go back to London and you don't pay my debts, right? No, no, I'm a man of my word. But you do have to remain here for a full year. You do realize that you can't take this back... Please, I don't want it. Midnight. I need you to go into town. Now? Yes, everyone's gathered in the church. - They're waiting for you. - It's tradition. They think I've accepted the gift. They wanted you to. Oh, my God! Just never ends, does it? It will, after you've told them your decision. Fine. - I'll go. - I'll go with you. It'll be easier. Wait, wait, wait... - Is this really necessary? - They're all waiting. Everyone. - Children, too. - Yeah but they're gonna hate me. Why can't you just tell them? It's the least that you can do, don't you think? Short and sweet. Short and sweet. Hello, everyone. Uh... I know that it's late, but Alec has been kind enough to come and talk to us. Uh, look, I'm sorry to say that, um... I won't be your healer. Look, this whole thing has been so... so strange and... um... and unexpected. I... I just couldn't handle it, so... I hope you all understand and... I'll be gone by next spring, so... We must respect Alec's decision. This wasn't easy on him. Also we must be grateful for the gifts he did give us the past couple of days. I know I am. Thank you, Alec, for our Rebecca. She... she talks so much, I want to shut her up! And I'd forgotten how annoying my wife's voice is when she's yelling at me. Just got my tests back, sugar's back to normal. Thank you, Alec. First time peeing without praying the rosary. Thanks, man. I lost my stutter, I can't thank you enough. I'd like to show it off by sharing with you all... loud and clear... that Mary and I are engaged. OK. OK. Settle down. Settle down. Alec, you are part of this community and we cherish your stay here regardless of your decision. Thank you. Oh! Girls... - This is from all of us. - Sorry we got you in trouble. It's a little late, but... happy birthday. Happy birthday, Alec! Um... Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Bailey? Yeah? We came because our daughter is very sick. Look... I cleared all this up yesterday, in the meeting. We're not from here. We've driven from far away to see you. I can't help your daughter. She has cancer. Doctors say there's no cure. I'm sorry that your daughter's so sick. Please, will you just come out and take a look? I'm gonna ask you politely to please leave my property. I've been harassed enough as it is. It's been a seven-hour drive. She's waiting outside. Please, please, just leave. Come on. Abigail, come on, sweetheart. We gotta go. It wasn't the perfume, it wasn't my great cooking... It was jealousy that woke the idiot. Well, congratulations. I love him so damn much, I miss his stutter. I'm going to the bathroom. Yeah... Hi. I'm Abigail. You talked to my parents. I can't help you. Of course you can't, I'm dying. You gonna eat that piece of bacon? I used to love eggs and hate bacon. After being zapped to bits by the crap they've put into me, I hate eggs and love bacon. Go figure. - I'm sorry you're so sick. - Yeah, it sucks. Oh, don't worry, it's not contagious. Look... Abigail, I'm not a healer. Healers don't exist, Alec. This is what we're gonna do. You and me. We're gonna hang out for the weekend. That's how long we're here in Lunenburg. And... Look. My parents drove me here, seven hours. I didn't wanna come. You know why I said yes? Why? Because... they really believe you have a good shot at curing me. Abigail, I... Don't call me by my name if you're gonna patronize me! Listen, they just realized I'm talking to you. My parents have gone through so much shit because of me. Three hospitals, four years, living in a suitcase and so... - This is my gift to them. - I... I can't... Yes, you can. Because you don't even have to do anything. I'm not this nasty all the time. It's two days. Then I'm gone. And when I die, they won't complain. Darling, don't bother this man. Guess what? Alec's reconsidered. He will try to cure me. What? Oh, my God! - Thank you, thank you. - Now, Mom, Dad, Alec can't promise this is gonna work. We don't... It's OK. So, me and him, we're gonna spend most of the weekend together. That's how it works. Right, Alec? Yeah. Yep. That's uh... That's how it works. Oh, my God! - So, where are we gonna go? - To work. I work for a vet. - Cool! I love animals. - Yeah? Yeah, doctors never allowed me to get a dog. Now I'm allowed, but... I wouldn't do that to him. If you feel sorry for me, - I will kick you where it hurts. - I didn't... What? Hey, it's not mine. - Uh-huh? - Just get in. Hey! Cecilia, this is Abigail. We're... gonna hang out together for the weekend. - Ah! Nice to meet you, Abigail. - Hi. Sorry for just showing up like this. Alec will explain, but basically my parents think he has a shot at curing me, so we're faking it. I told her she could help up around the farm. Oh, yeah. - I wanna be a vet too. - Awesome! Is that a Border Collie? Yep! His name is Batman. I love them! I'm... I'm sorry. I should have... - She begged me. - No, of course, it's fine. She said it was some kind of gift to her parents so they don't lose hope, so... She seems nice. Yeah. She has cancer, though. She's not gonna make it. But she's feisty. You want it? Woo-hoo! Are you OK? So... When were you first diagnosed? Third of April, four years ago. You must have been in shock. Not really, I mean... I was lucky because my doctor at the time was very cool. He refused to call it cancer. He said there were too many bad connotations of the word. My diagnosis was "a bad case of marshmallow." I like that. So... you two have a thing going? - No. - No. - Please. - No, really, we don't. We're just friends. That's not what Batman told me. Are you OK? No, I have terminal marshmallow. How about I take you back? That'll be good. Need my dose of oxygen. Alright, so I'll be seeing you both tomorrow? Thanks. Love it here. Mmm. Follow me! - What? - You like her, don't you? She's beautiful. Yes, she is. But, um... it's not possible. Why? Because you work for her? Can you keep a secret? Cecilia... likes women. Oh, bullcrap from Mars! No, she doesn't! - She does. - Look. I know lesbians and Cecilia is not one. Oh, what, so you're an expert, are you? My sister is a lesbian, and, yes, I am. You have a sister? Yes, she's 25 and she's a mega-lesbian which makes me an expert. She's lying. Why she's lying to you... is a whole other matter. Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? Just get in! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie. Open the door! Open the door, Charlie! Abigail, open the door! Charlie! Charlie... I need to ask you a question. - Are you drunk? - This is one question. - OK. - Could I have saved her? Abigail. Could I have cured her? - I don't know, Alec. - Please, no, don't say that. Could I have cured Charlie? - Charlie? - Charlie! He's... My brother! Charlie! He died of marshmallow! I can't watch her die. - Why don't you come inside? - He was the smart one. He... he was the one who came up with the healer idea. It wasn't just one stupid thing. It was gonna... He... we had 20 stores ready, he was... I'm so sorry, Alec. When he died... everything died. He was my everything. Can I get the gift back? You heard Raymond, it's not possible. Please... I think I'm gonna be sick. - OK, why don't you come inside? - Look, I don't... Come on. - OK... - I'm gonna... - Are you all packed? - I have everything. - You do? - Don't worry, I'll be fine. - Alright. Sunscreen? - Yeah. - OK. - She'll be alright. - Hey there! - Hi! - Where's Alec? - He asked me to pick up Abigail. It's fine, Mom. She's the vet. - OK, well, we'll see you at six. - OK. Bye. Have a good time, sweetheart. - Good? - Mm-hmm. Alright! Let's go! Bye, baby. So, did you get some good sleep last night? Yeah. Alec tells me you're into chicks? What? I promised him not to tell you. - I said I didn't buy it. - Um... Yeah, I kinda told him that so that he wouldn't hit on me. I knew it. He's cute. Yeah, he is cute. So, why don't you want him to hit on you? Well, he has quite the reputation. - He is a hothead. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, his uncle actually warned me. Oh, uh... So, last night, Alec actually fell asleep at my place. Alright! Now we're talking! No, he was drunk and he fell asleep. Mm-hmm? Seriously! I'm not kidding. You'll see for yourself. OK! Alright. - I hope heaven's just like this. - Me too. What about you, Alec? Um... I'm not sure. That's one shitty answer. Well, if there is a heaven, then... If? What do you think happens when you die? Has anybody in your family died? All of them. Wow... My, um... my twin brother... He had what you have. What's his name? Charlie. When? Two years ago. - Charlie. - Hmm. Charlie must be so pissed off at you. Why? Why? For thinking he just went poof and ceased to exist! You're an idiot, Alec Bailey. Is that the reason you lost your smile? Maybe. Come here. I promise when I get to heaven, I'll send you a message. Oh, yeah? I'll probably scare the crap out of you. Yeah, that's for sure. It sucks that the weekend's over. I wish I would've my parents it took a month for this to work. A month? No, thanks. Now we're gonna go to "Gimme some lovin'..." - Stop the truck! - What? Alec, stop the truck! I need to get out! - Are you OK? - Just stop the truck! Stop it! - Alright, alright! - Stop it! Stop it! Stop the truck! Stop it! I love this song! This is our war song at the hospital. When this song came on, we all danced. Now the three of us are gonna dance. - Come on! - Um... Whoa, whoa. No, no. I don't dance. Are you kidding me? How can you not dance to this! - Alright, then play the guitar! - What? Play the air guitar, Alec. It's like this! Come on, come on! OK? Are you gonna give me another ticket? Hi, Uncle Tom. Hi there, sweetie. Everything OK here? The best. - You come here a sec? - Why? Just come here. Just wanted to thank you for this. Her father is my brother. And I haven't seen him this happy for... Well, a long time. Come here. - It's getting cold. - Shut up, Alec. I'm gonna die and not from the weather. Alright. Wait. I don't wanna say goodbye in front of my parents. I hate goodbyes. So, rule number one, no one gets emotional. Deal? - Deal. - Deal. I wrote you guys a poem. Don't worry, it's really short. It's called "Just Breathe." We all at some point stop breathing. What if we lived one breath at a time? We speak as though breathing is easy, because it is innate. Is that a cool word or what? Half the time, we don't even notice our breath. When did breathing become the uncool kid that all the other body parts ignored? Think about the phrase, "Catch your breath." You have to catch it because you've lost control of it. Alec and Cecilia, find control over your breath and, please, live for me like tomorrow is your last day. Cecilia, we made a deal. Here. Thanks, Alec. I thought this was gonna be good for my parents, but... it's been incredible for me also. Well, it was, uh... It was special for me, too. Dear Jesus, he showed his feelings! Trust me on this, Alec. Charlie is in a better place. And he just wants you to be happy. Um... I'll take you back. Please! I can see my parents from here. Oh! One more thing. She lied. She's not into chicks. And... I lied, I don't have a sister. Bye! - What? - Huh? Hold on a minute. Wait. Why did you lie? Your uncle said you were a loose wire and that you would try and get in my pants. Oh, you're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? You asked me out three minutes into meeting me. He's unbelievable! I'm gonna have to have a word with him! Well, you might wanna talk to him today, since he's leaving tomorrow. Wait. He's still here? Yeah! He's at your house, or his house. I need to talk to him, come on! Raymond! I'm down here! One or two things I have to do. Then, I'll be gone. I want my gift back. What? Well, it's a bit late for that. Why the sudden change of heart? It doesn't matter why. I just... I made a mistake and now I want it back. Alec, I made it very clear. I know what you said about my birthday and midnight, but... There's got to be some other way. - I don't make the rules. - Who does? Who do I have to convince? Well, Alec, that will be the one you don't believe in. I'm just an ant on this planet. Hey, there's gotta be some kind of clause, like a time span or something! - I'm afraid not. - There isn't, Alec. I was... I was freaking out, OK? I didn't know what I was doing. I had sheep following me! - You made your choice. - Choice? I'm sorry, how was I supposed to suddenly just accept that I had some weird superpowers? I didn't have any time to understand and to reflect! And now I know I can help, so I want it back! Too late... You told me I was the healer... Where's my frame? I took it down. We didn't need it anymore. You both played me... like a puppet. I should've known about this from the start. Wait, that's not the way that it works... Oh, bullshit with how it works, not how it works! A little honesty and maybe I would've made the right choice. - Wait... - Don't touch me! You could've stopped this. Maybe I could've saved Abigail. It's not up to us anymore. Better leave him be. Father Malloy! Hello! Alec. What're you doing? The place's closed at this hour. Well, open it! I need to go in there. What's going on? How do I talk to Him? Who? Him, Him, your boss... Him. - God? - Yeah. You just talk. He listens. OK... Can you just do it for me? - No. I can't do that. - Hey, look, you owe me! You are right! I do. But this... you gotta do it alone. Just close the door when you're done. Thank you. This is ridiculous. Actually... actually, do you know what? What kind of a thing are you? Huh? I mean, if you are good like you say you are, then why you let young people get sick and die? Huh? Why don't you start by answering me that? I mean, Abigail? Are you serious? Are you that perverse? She's 14-years-old! Now, you give me back my gift! I swear, if you let Abigail die, I'll curse the day you ever existed. Charlie! Charlie, if you're up there, punch this idiot in the face for me. I want it back! This baby is old, Josh. I had to do a bit of a number on her. I know. My wife had me convinced to buy another. - Let me give you something. - No, please. Don't worry. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Beers on me. Any time. - Alright, mate. - See you! - Later! - Hey, Cecilia. - Hey! Hey! How are you? Uh... Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I... I bought you a gift. Um... they're forget-me-nots. I figured that they could be a symbol of renewed friendship or... something. And... now it feels really cheesy to have bought them. I'm really sorry... about how it all played out. There was no need to lie all the time. Your uncle asked me to. So you're a lesbian... Um... - About Abigail, I... - Please. Um... I blamed you for Abigail and... and I'm sorry. Look. I'm an idiot, alright? I was always gonna make the wrong choice. Alec, she wrote us a letter. What? It's... one of the reasons that I got the courage to come and see you today. What's it say? I don't know, I wanted to read it with you. Where is your phone? Oh... 555-0174. - Yes? - Abigail. - It's Alec and Cecilia. - Hi! What took you guys so damn long? You were supposed to call me! I'm so sorry! We just opened your letter. So, how are you both? - Fine... - Yeah, we're fine. - How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. So... I have some news, guys. - Alright. - OK. Well, turns out about a year ago I was put on palliative care. Bottom line, it's like a death sentence because the chemotherapy was no longer working. Right... But... But what? When I got back, I bumped into the marshmallow doctor I told you about. He was surprised I looked so healthy, so... he wanted to ran a few tests. You won't believe this. Some kind of weird remission. - What does that mean? - Wait, what is that? What's "some kind of weird remission"? I know, I know, I didn't understand it either. Well, A, somehow the cancer's going away. B, they're gonna give me a treatment to get rid of what's still there, and C... I'm not gonna die! And I'll be there for Christmas! Oh, my God! Guys, I'm still on the phone here! Sorry! Sorry! - Hey, Alec? - Yeah? You should tell everyone you cured me. Take the credit. My parents are convinced it was you. Oh, and get ready, 'cause they're sending over three baskets of fruit. Spoiler alert, don't touch the apples. They suck. - Alright! - Listen, I've gotta go. Call me! Oh! Yes, and, uh... say hi to your sister for us. Oh, and Cecilia, if you haven't kissed this idiot by now, just hurry up and do it. Love you guys! Bye... This is unbelievable... - Wait, wait. Stop! Stop! - Whoa, whoa! I just landed on this. - Babe, what are you...? - I'm just gonna get some water. Go back to sleep. You scared the crap out of me! What are you doing here? It is my house. Well, I had something to do in the basement. Can I ask you a question? Hmm? When your father found out he was a healer, did he...? Did he accept the gift immediately? No. No, he didn't. He didn't want the gift. But then something happened to make him change his mind. - What happened? - Frankly, Alec... that is now none of your business. She's not gonna die, you know. Abigail, the little girl. She... She is in remission. Really? Well, that is good news. - Bye, Alec. - Bye. Oh, Alec. Ever noticed anything odd about yourself? Hmm? Batman? Oh, my God! Cecilia!
