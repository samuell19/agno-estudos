Good morning, Sergeant. - Good morning. I suppose you want Kennedy again? Yep. Why anybody should want him is more than I can figure out. Here is the dough. Bring Kennedy up. - Right. You'd save money if you'd keep him out of here. I did the best I could, Sergeant. But it ain't no use. He ought to lay off that rough stuff. Somebody ought to talk to him like a mother. Why don't you do it? Say, how come he wrecked that dance hall? It was just an accident, Sergeant. It wasn't Eddie's fault. Two big bruisers take a poke at me as I'm making a bit hit with their girls. Just because Eddie starts working on them with a chair .. Is no reason for everybody to bust up the furniture. Hello Bucky. - Eddie. Let's get out of here. Don't like the service. Next time you're pinched I hope they take you to some other jail. You and me both. That thing you wear for a face is beginning to haunt me. Well, this cost me fifty bucks. Look at all the fun you had. Yeah, but I owe everybody in town. Oh, you're kicking? And what are you kicking about? You're the one who gets me into these jams. Look here. You've got to quit choosing those big guys. Look at my hands. All busted up in getting you out of tight spots. Now you've got to quit it. Maybe you're right, Eddie. I can't borrow another dime on my salary. Maybe I'd better curb my temper. Well, that's an idea. Come on. Didn't you see that sign "No Parking"? I bet you're having a good time doing that since you learned to write. By the look of that pan of yours you may have made one of them cracks last night. Now look here, Officer. There is no reason for you to .. Hey .. I can't borrow any more money. Alright. It's alright. Yes. A very fine hand. Palmer method? No. All my own. Thanks. Come on. Beat it or I'll give you another one. Well. I still insist you had a very fine hand. Get going. Hey, hey! How do you think I'm going to get out? How'd you get in? I drove in. - Well, drive out. Oh, you're a tough guy are you? Who me? No, I'm the kind of a guy that stays out of trouble. So what? That don't make sense. What don't? "So what". So what, "what"? Now look here, you can't go through life saying "so what, what". Saying what? So what, what? What are you talking about? I don't know. You started it. Look, I asked you how I was going to get out of here. And I asked you how you got in. So what? I don't know how you feel about it but I'm getting awfully tired of this. Tell you what you do. Tell it to him. Why should I tell it to him? Well, he won't understand you either. So what? Ah, you .. Did you hear me tell that guy? - What did you say? Hello, Toots. Say, what happened to you last night? I got a black eye trying to get under the piano. Oh. How about tonight? I've got the menace with me. Dust off a girlfriend and bring her along for him. Hey, I don't want no dusty dames. I want to go out with Marie. Yes .. hello .. quarter of eight? Yeah, quarter of eight. Right? Bye. Now why don't you lay off that Marie. She's only after your money. What money? - Oh, I get it. She likes you because you're pretty. I see. Come on. Mr Harris wants to see you. Who is Harris? - The new Traffic Manager. He must have heard about us already. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. - Maybe he wants to give us a raise? No. Nobody ever gets a raise around here until they've been fired three times. A new Traffic Manager, huh? We'll straighten him out right off the bat. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Will you let me do the talking? All of it. You keep quiet. Well. So you are Mr Kennedy? And you are Mr Willetts? And you drive the St. Louis - Chicago run. You just finished a trip today. And this is your day off. That's what you think. But I have other plans for you. There's ten tons of machinery on the platform. Load it yourself and get going to Chicago. So what? "Now fades the .." "Glimmering landscape." "On the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds." "Save where the beetle wheels." "In his droning flight." "And drowsy tinklings lull .." "The distant folds." Hey, what's this all about? It don't make sense. It don't make sense the way you read it, you split-skull. It's all about the country, about the chickens and the cows. The people are happy and contented. Do you really think the cows are contented? Why shouldn't they be? They don't have to drive a truck for a living. Yeah, that's right. They don't. Will you stop asking me these silly questions .. Get a load of this swell country we're passing through. Do you really like the country? Better than the city? Someday, I'm going to come out to one of these little burghs like Ostopolis. And spend a whole weekend, instead of sitting in a city just lapping up beer. But I thought you liked beer? - I do like beer. But out here you can go for long walks. And get a load of this swell breeze on your chest. And go fishing in a nice little stream or lie around in a hammock. That's what I'd call a perfect weekend. What's the matter? You stupid numbskull. Did you ever hear of sticking out your hand for a stop? What you trying to do, steal some gas out of our tank? Is that supposed to be funny? Look here, sister. - Don't "sister" me. If I was your sister I'd shoot myself. Not a bad idea. You insolent .. Hey! You can't do that to my pal. Whoa. So you're one of them "smacking dames" are you? Come on, back that tin can off our truck and get out of here. Go on. Get out. What happened, Miss Reid? These men have ruined my car and insulted me. Oh, fresh guys, huh? You keep your nose out of this. You're looking for trouble, eh? - No, I ain't looking for trouble. I'm dishing it out. Come on, come on. Up. Up. Did I give it to him. Now let that be a lesson to you. Come on, get up there. We're always getting into jams over dames. You started it. How come you hit that guy with your head? You didn't think I was going to hit him with that, did you. That thing has just had the splints taken off it. I'm not taking any more chances of breaking my hands. From now on. I'm using my head. That's the truck. He's the one. Climb down, buddy. You're under arrest. Here we go again. What do I charge him with? Molesting Miss Reid. Assault and battery. Disturbing the peace. I knew this would happen. All you got to do is go back to St. Louis and raise some bail. That's all I got to do? That's all. Go ahead. Get going, will you. Make it fast. Come on, let's go. Oh, resisting an Officer, eh? Come on. Messeldopp. A customer. Pardon me. A little trouble, son? - Yeah. Assault and battery. Disturbing the peace. And resisting .. Nah, I guess that's enough. Go on, give me the rest of it. I can stand it. That'll hold you. What's your name? - Eddie Kennedy. Better look after him, Messeldopp. He thinks he's tough. Well now, you don't look like a bad young fellow at all. I'm really a very nice guy. - What did you do? Socked a guy named Brown. You did? - Yeah. Congratulations. I figure you and me are going to get along right well. I see you don't like Brown. Nobody around here likes him. He is District Manager for the Statewide Corporation. What's that? A milk company. Squeezing the farmers. An octopus we call them. Paying starvation prices for milk. Maybe I should have used an ax. That's a good one. This way, son. - Yeah. Mr Richardson, this is Mr Kennedy. Richardson is a horse doctor from Moline. How are you? I'll bet it was a woman got you into this. Yeah. A woman had a thing to do with it. Why? I knew it! They are the scourge of the earth. Oh,? One of them put the bite on you? Women! Tyrants destroying the freedom of mankind. He's in for alimony. Yeah. I got that. Why should I support a wife weighing 200 pounds? Have you any idea how much she eats? No, I've never met the lady. It was a sad say when I asked her to be my wife. Why did you do it? Well, she runs a boarding house and I was behind with my bill. Ah .. real, real love. That's what I like to see. Do you play cards, Mr Kennedy? - Yeah. I'm glad you happened along. Have a bottle of beer. Well, I wish they had jails like this in St. Louis. I try to make the boys comfortable. You'll like it alright. I won't be here long. I've got a nitwit friend of mine digging up the bail. That's too bad. Women. I'll give it back to you first pay-day, Mike. Honest I will. Fifty bucks? That's a lot of dough. It's very important. I got to have it. Why don't you get it from the company? Well, there is reasons. Well, I don't know. It means my job, Mike. I've been a pretty good guy with you. I've drunk a lot of your liquor, even you had the bad stuff. Who was it drank that terrible gin you made when nobody else would touch it? Me. Yeah, you were alright. Well, what do you say? For old time's sake. Well. Okay. But I get it back pay-day. Sure. Positively. Ten, twenty, thirty. Forty .. fifty. Thanks, Mike. You don't know what this means to me. Have a drink on it. - Well, just a short one. Meet Buck Willetts, girls. What you going to have? - Champagne cocktail. Me too. Two beers. [ Door knocks ] Pop. Pop! Messeldopp! Yep? Somebody wants to get in. Oh goodness. [ Door knocks ] Yes, yes. Just a second. Just a second. I've got some more customers for you. I might have known it would turn out like this. What's the charge? - Drunk driving. Speeding with a truck and chasing a Chinaman up a side road. You hadn't ought to have done that. What's your name? - Buck Willetts. Buck. Willetts. And yours? Babe Smith. Babe Smith. Yours? - Gracie Smith. Gracie Smith. And yours? Johnson. Excuse me. Come here. Chasing Chinamen, huh? And me waiting here. I'm sorry, Eddie. Did you get the dough? Yeah, I got it. Where is it? I must have spent it. Hello .. you must have spent it? On those tomatoes, I suppose? They was only helping me to forget your troubles. Oh they were. You hadn't ought to have done that. They're here, Jeremiah. Who? - The prisoners. Oh yes. Hear ye, hear ye. This court is now in session. Magistrate Jones presides. Court is called to order. Say. Did you say the judge was also a farmer? Milk farmer? One of the best in these parts. Thanks. Brown versus Kennedy. You say this fellow smacked you? He butted me with his head like a goat. What did you do that for? It's what any honest man would have done. How? It's a fine state of affairs when a man like Brown .. Can make it so tough for the poor, hard- working farmers and get away with it. What's that? - Just a minute. What did you say? I say that this Brown, this tool of the milk company. Has been robbing the farmer for years. I don't see that this has anything to do with the case. Shut up. Go on. Explain what you mean, young man. Just this. I'm a hard-working truck driver. I've been driving a truck through these parts for a long while. And it's been my misfortune to watch the milk farmer getting poorer and poorer. And I say it's because of the greediness of this octopus. The milk company. I object. Shut up. Go on. It's men like Brown who squeeze every drop of milk from hard-working farmers. And pay him starvation price in return for it. What else could any red-blooded man do, but fight against it. Mr Jones, I object. Shut up. Go on. Sir, I stopped my truck short to avoid a poor innocent cow standing in the road. Mr Brown came along and sneered at me, but I let that pass. But when he made the crack about the farmers .. I had to let him have it. - Good work. This whole thing is a lie. If you don't shut up I'll jail you for contempt. Go on, son. Oh. I wish I was a farmer for a few days. What would you do? - I'd fight. I'd fight the injustices of Mr Brown and the milk company. I'd make them pay fairer prices. Mr Magistrate, I demand that I be heard. I always thought you were a swindler. Case dismissed. And let me tell you Mr Brown. The next time you molest an honest hard-working truck driver .. About his duty I won't go so easy with you. Mr Magistrate! - Not another word. You've said a lot of sensible things, young man. Any time I can do anything for you .. You just call on me. Right. Yes, Your Honor. You can. You see those people over there? They're my friends. They knew I was in trouble and they were just trying to help me. Well, they may have speeded up a little bit but really they didn't mean it. Case dismissed. Pleased to meet you. - Thanks. Thanks again, judge. Thanks very much. That my friend is known as the old oil. But Eddie, I didn't know you liked farmers. Of course I like farmers. Why shouldn't I? The backbone of our country. Without them we'd have no food. When do we eat? You two ate enough last night to do you for a week. Hey. Eli Caf?. Steaks and chops. Let's go. - Steaks and chops. Boy, can I eat a breakfast. And as a boy who can pay for it? Aha. Holding out again. Alright, we eat. I don't know whether to have ham and eggs or a nice, big juicy steak. You mean after that speech of yours, you will eat a poor, defenceless cow? Ah, shut your mouths. So this is what you do. You're a hash-slinger. I own this place. I don't feel so hungry now. I think we should all have ham and eggs. Make it a whole lot easier. I don't think this sweet young thing can remember more than one order at a time. Yep, ham and eggs. - Same here. Uhuh. Look. Four orders of ham and eggs. Get it? One, two, three, four. Four orders. Get it? That's the girl. Boy am I hungry. - Hmm does that look good. What's the matter? Don't you like it? There is nothing the matter with that. Tastes alright to me. Four dollars? - Eat it and shut up. Let's get out. But Eddie, wasn't you hungry? Say, what's your hurry? Why don't you wait for us? Ah pipe down, pipe down. It serves you right. Have an omelette on me. It's nice to see the old place again. - Hey, don't you want to get paid? Say, where was you both last night? Stopped at our country place over night. I got thirty cents. - That's better than usual. What will I use for money next week? Well, never let it be said. Fifty-fifty. Twenty-five for me. Fifteen for you. Fair enough? Sure. Fifty-fifty. Kennedy. Kennedy! Come here. Who me? Yes, you. And you too, Willetts. Come here both of you. Mr Kennedy. I suspect that you know Miss Reid. Well. One meets so many people, Mr Harris. Miss Reid has called about some damages. Nine crates of eggs smashed. The amount of the claim is forty dollars and twenty cents. Why. Barring the population. There aren't that many eggs in Ostopolis. I promised Miss Reid I would personally collect the damages for her. Come on, Buck. Shell out. Here you are. Twenty-five. And. Fifteen. And. Twenty. Right? - That's correct. Miss Reid. Thank you, Mr Harris. - Not at all. It was indeed a pleasure. Hiya, Pete. Hello, Pete. - Hello, fellahs. Coffee. - Double it. I hear you took a vacation up in the country. Yep. Beautiful hotel, swimming pool, tennis courts. All outside rooms. Beautiful. Why did they put bars on the windows? To keep the wrong kind of people from getting in. I thought it was to keep us from getting out. What's the idea of canned milk? Come on, give us some cream. What's the matter with you guys? Don't you read the papers? Why, there is a milk war on. Look at that. Milk? Oh, Magistrate Jones. That's what you get for giving that hay-burner ideas. Now we got to drink our coffee black. [ Telephone ] Answer that phone will you, Buck. Hello? Tell Eddie and Buck, Harris wants to see them. Okay. Harris wants to see us right away. I wonder what he's cooking up now. Well boys, I've got some good news for you. The Statewide Company gave us a contract to bring in milk from outside the state. The farmers will probably try to stop the trucks. So I'll need drivers who can take a beating. I know a couple of pugs. Ah, no. I don't need pugs when I have Kennedy. You take the run from the state line though Ostopolis. A tough route, isn't it. Oh yes. But you know that district so well. I couldn't think of anyone I'd rather have. I don't like the idea of tangling with those farmers. They never did anything to me. What's the matter, Kennedy? Ain't getting yellow, are you? Look, Harris. Some day. When the weather is all nice and clear. I'm going to knock your nose right around to your ear. Yeah? I'll keep an eye on the weather. Yeah, and pray for rain. Not bad. They say milk is full of that alphabet stuff. What do you mean, "alphabet"? - You know. A-B-C-D .. Vitamins. It gives you strength. It looks like you're going to need all that alphabet. I don't need no alphabet. - Wait a bit. Don't start anything. This is as far as you go. Drive that truck back through the state line or have your milk dumped. Now take your choice. I'm sorry, mister. But I got orders to take this milk through. Alright men, let's dump her. Hey! Hurry up men. Get that milk down. Get in there, Joe. Hey! Get out of there. Come on, break it up. Break it up! It ain't no use, officer. These trucks are not going through here. If we don't stop them other farmers will. No decision this time, farmer. But next time we meet I will give it to you. That's enough out of you. Now let's get going. Come on. You're all going off. Did you see me give it to that farmer? State versus Willetts. Kennedy. And others. So. You were driving the milk truck, eh? Yes, Your Honor. I was .. - Shut up. Working for the milk company, eh? Working for that "octopus" you was talking about? An honest man who said he felt sorry for the poor, starving farmers. What have you to say for yourself? - Well .. Shut up! Wanted to be a farmer yourself, eh? You double-crossing .. Whipper-snapper. I didn't want to drive for them, judge. My company made me. But I wouldn't let them get away with it. I was going to dump the milk myself. And I was very glad when the boys came along. I really was. So I hear. Shut up! Sit down. I will now pronounce sentence. Roebuck. One day suspended sentence. Hofstetter. One day suspended sentence. Marr. One day suspended sentence. Zimmer. One day suspended sentence. Benson. How is your wife feeling? She's much better, thank you, Judge. Two hours, suspended sentence. Willetts. Stand up. Two days in jail. Kennedy. Stand up. Ten days. In jail. I'm sure glad to see you boys back again. Been missing my card games. You haven't by any chance missed our dough? Oh no. I like your company. The peace and quiet of the country. Why argue with me? If you've got any squawks, go to Bennett. He's the boss. We've already seen Bennett. We told him you're not getting milk through to us. What do you think I am, a miracle worker? I don't know what you are. But our contract calls for delivery to our dairies. I got grief enough without worrying about your contract. Eight trucks wrecked. Thirty-seven loads dumped. Five drivers in the hospital. I never expected those farmers to fight any more than you did. Maybe not. But we don't want any more losses. That's why we've called in Hunter. Now I begin to get it. His men are going to ride the trucks from now on. They are going to be armed. To protect our property. I guarantee that every truck gets through. So that's the gag, huh? If you think I'll let you put some punch drunk gunmen on my trucks, you're crazy. I'm not going to have my drivers mixed up in things like that. You can keep your drivers home. I'm putting two men on each of your trucks. Are you asking me or telling me? I'm telling you. Your boss okayed it. Give me Mr Bennett's office. Sorry, Mr Harris. Mr Bennett is out playing golf. Golf! He plays golf and this is what I get. Two more of my drivers in a jam. Here. You try and get them out. That's your district. "Farmers attacked truck." "We attacked farmers. Police attacked us." "We are now in jail. Rush bail." "We would like to get out tonight. Eddie Kennedy." Kennedy? I wouldn't get him out if you paid me for it. He's the one that started this. - He what? He started the whole mess. I threw him in jail for socking me. And he talked that sap Jones into fighting all the milk dealers. Give me that telegram. Here, take an answer to this. Address Eddie Kennedy. Ostopolis jail. A telegram, Eddie. Ah. Just what we've been waiting for. The company comes to the rescue. Be out of here in a few minutes now. Why, that dirty double-crosser. What is it? Get this. "You started the whole mess. Now stick around and enjoy it. Stop." "You and that dumb Buck are fired. Harris." Calling me dumb? Can't blame him for that but making us stay and take the whole rap burns me up. Bad news, boys? If I could only lay my hands on that .. Looks as though you boys are going to stay with me for a while. Here you are Mr Messeldopp. Breakfast for four. Is she going to feed us? - That's right. Bad enough we got to stay in here without having to eat her cooking. Well Mr Messeldopp, I see you have the monkeys back in the cage again. A very funny crack. I'm dying. I wish you were. You know him, Ann? Who, the farmers' friend? Uhuh, I know him. Not very well though. You'll know him a whole lot better before long. Oh no. Not if I have anything to say about it. You won't. Now you can take all that junk back where you got it from. But Eddie, I'm hungry. I wouldn't eat anything that dame cooked if I starved to death. Is that a promise? That's an idea. Let's go on a hunger strike. I'll starve with you. Women. Men. You know, I'm going to enjoy bringing food over here .. Because I like to see things in their proper place: behind bars. When I get out of this joint, the first stop I'm going to make is your beanery. And it won't be for breakfast, either. Ha. You guys looking for trouble? No. Just turn around and drive the other way. Oh yeah? And what if we don't? Your milk gets dumped. Hijackers, huh? Are you going to turn around? No, we're not going to turn around. Now you hicks run along home and play with your cards before you get hurt. Not a bad picture of your pan. And that's just a friendly little tip. Now get out of the road before we run over you. Come on. Come on, let's go. What's the idea? We going to beat it? - No. Going to pay the girlfriend a visit. Show her some dynamite. What about me? You stay here. They'll be letting you out tomorrow. Your time is up. You better be careful. They'll hold you in this hoosegow until you're an old man with a white beard. You take care of Andy. What will I tell him in case he wakes up? Tell him I'll be back about 12 o'clock. You think he'll believe me? No. What are you doing here? Thought to pay you a little visit. You'd better go back to your cage before you get into trouble. Come on. Put that bayonet down before you hurt yourself. You know, with that pretty pan of yours you shouldn't have a sour disposition. You should be easy to get along with. Why do you think I want to get along with you? Ah. There you go again. A guy tries to be friendly and what do you do? You hand him the ice-pitcher. Hey, hey! A little service, please. I'll get rid of him. The place is closed. - It's open. It is closed. It's closed. It's closed. Now where do we go? I'm going home. - Aha. Suits me. Peaceful and quiet in the country, isn't it. Isn't it? Well, it may not be peaceful but it is quiet. So this is home? Looks like you got a lot of sisters, cousins and aunts. It's a lot safer than home with you around. Now, why do you have to say that? You don't know how nice I can be. Now wait a minute. Hello, Ann. - Hello. How are you? Say folks, I want you to meet Ann Reid. Hi, Ann. My name is Kennedy. How are you all? Say Ann, how about this dance? - Certainly. Uhuh. Your coat. That should look well on you. Step this way just one minute. I want to show you something. A good dancer like you. You shouldn't waste your time with those plow jockeys. I didn't think truck drivers knew how to dance. Oh no? Look, a little something of my own. You've got an awful lot to learn about truck drivers. I'm learning. - Aha. You know, you'd be swell if you would just stop arguing with me. It would be better if you'd stop annoying me. You don't look very annoyed. Well, I suppose I'm getting used to it. Why don't you break down and be human? I am human. It is peaceful and quiet out here in the country, isn't it. Yes, it is now since you've stopped putting the growl on me. Well. Here we are. How much longer do you have to stay in this? Well I've been in two days. I got eight to go. From now on I'm taking the nights off. So how about, say, 9 o'clock tomorrow night? It's a date? - Hmm. - Alright. Take care of that pretty pan. I'm beginning to like it. He didn't wake up? Did you tame her? You bet I did. I told her plenty. What happened? We went down to a dance by the lake. Sounds to me as if she tamed you. No, no, no. Who won the last round? I did. You boys hadn't ought to be up so late. Oh, it you again, huh? Yes, it's me. When you shot up that barn yesterday, you killed two of my best horses. Ah, you're breaking my heart. Now I haven't any chance against that gun. But if you'll stop hiding behind it like a yellow rat .. And come down here, I'll take it out of your hide. These tough guys scare me. Attaboy Louie. Let him have it. Come on, Louie. Put him out of the way and let's get home. Come on. Get up and fight. [ Gunshot! ] [ Ann screams! ] Got a guy here named Eddie Kennedy? Right there. Let's have him. The Sheriff's office wants you, Eddie. What's up? Never mind. Just come along. I knew it. I knew something would happen. Ah, don't worry. I'll be back. Take it easy. Kennedy. - Yeah? Where were you last night between eight and one? Why? Come on, come on. I got tired of sitting in your hoosegow, so .. I went to a dance. So we heard. Who did you go with? What difference does it make? - Just open up. We know all about it. Then why ask me? You went with Ann Reid, didn't you? Yeah. When did you leave the dance? About 12 o'clock. - Then where'd you go? She drove me back to the jail. - Just come clean with us, Kennedy. What this all about? Let me in on it. Do you deny that you killed Benson? Killed who? James Benson was found on the highway this morning shot. And you think I did it? More than think. We are pretty sure of it. Ah, that's a lot of tripe. You've got a bad record, Kennedy. You've been in jail several times in St. Louis and twice here. You told Benson if he tangled with you again, he'd never live to tell about it. You drove Miss Reid's car away from that dance about 12 o'clock. Look, you can clear the whole thing up in two minutes. All you got to do is call Ann Reid. She will say she drove me back to the jail. Miss Reid's car was found beside Benson's body one hour later. Yes. And Miss Reid has disappeared. Disappeared? - Surprised, eh? What happened to her? - Well, that's for you to tell us. I told you all I know. If you think I'd do anything to hurt her, you're crazy. Alright, if you want to be tough. Will you stop being a numbskull and listen to me. I'm saying .. Shut up or we put a muzzle on you. Take him over to Mayfield and book him on suspicion of murder. You'll talk later. Come on then. Ten gallons of gas. - Coming up. Be on the lookout for Eddie Kennedy. Eddie Kennedy described as an American. 24 years old. 5 feet 10 inches. [ Telephone ] Hello? Eddie. Are you alright? When did you get in? Tonight. I tried to phone you a few hours ago. I must have been out eating. Listen, don't come near the apartment. They got a couple of guys covering it. Oh, thanks. That's Kennedy talking. Trace the call. Supervisor. Trace the call on the Sergeant's line. It's a drug-store. 726 Varney Street. Okay. 726 Varney Street. A pay station in a drug store. Broadcast it. - Did you get it, Jack? Yeah, okay. Calling cars 93 and 95. Cars nine-three and nine-five. Kennedy located. 726 Varney Street. He's talking on the phone. Rush there. Let's go, Charlie. Do you think the dame killed him? No. What do you think happened to her? How do I know? Since she's in trouble I've got to go find her. How you going to do it? Do you think I'd be standing here talking to you if I knew how? I'll keep in touch with you by phone. Yeah. Bye. Where's the guy that was using that phone? He just went down the street. This way, fellahs. I wonder who they're after. Me. What the ..? - Hello, Eddie. Keep driving fast, boys. Get me out of this district. It's getting hot. - You said it. You're in a swell jam this time. Did you kill the guy? - No. It's a bum rap. I thought so too when I read about it. Duck. What are you guys doing in this local? I thought you were on a milk haul too. - We were, but they took us off. Yeah. They put on a bunch of tough guys to get the milk through. Gunmen? - Yeah. And the Des Moines run too? The one through Ostopolis? Sure. They need them in that district more than anywhere. Well, look. Drive me over to the warehouse will you, and get me inside. I must get a look at those route sheets. - Okay. All clear, Eddie. Go and pick up Buck and tell him to meet me at Mike's place.
