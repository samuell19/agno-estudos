(Multicom Jingle) - [Announcer] Tonight's film is a dramatization based on court transcripts, police reports and published accounts. (soft piano music) (plane engines roaring) - You know, I just don't understand you. You complained all day yesterday and today about being sick and now you wanna go out. It's cold and miserable out there. Why don't you just stay inside tonight and you can go out bowling next week? - You know I like to bowl on Sunday nights. Besides, the fresh air'll probably do me good. I'm taking your car. - Try to be home early. (soft somber music) (light country music) (car horn honking) - Brr, it's cold. (chuckles) Wanna grab a bite? - Sure. (pins clanking) - Yes! (people chattering) - How you doin', buddy? Hey. Hey, how you guys doin'? - Hey, big fella. Bowling? - Nah, I can't. I can only stay for a while. - I'm feeling great tonight. That spare is mine. - Oh yeah? All right, lemme see ya, hotshot. Pick it up, pick it up. Let's go Wally-Wally Washington. C'mon. (bowling pins clanking) - Oh yeah, all right. - Yes, all right! If I bit you, would you taste like mint? - You have to find out. (Paul chuckling) - [Grace] Betty Jeanne, my little guy's gonna be too sick to go. - Aww, that's too bad. - [Grace] Yeah well, there'll be lots of other games. What about Kristan? She'll wanna go, won't she? When does she come back from skiing? - Tomorrow, but I've already warned her she's got lots of homework to catch up on. - [Grace] Well if I think of anybody else, I'll call you back, okay? - I'll be here all night. (intriguing jazz music) (plane engine whooshing) (guns blasting) (intense foreboding music) (phone ringing) Hello. - [Grace] Hi, it's me again. I needed to see that (drowned out by static), so I called up the village and Gary said he'd like to go. - Oh, Grace. (soft foreboding music) (doorbell ringing) Oh my god, what are you doing? What are you doing? (pole smacking) (Betty wincing) Oh my god. Why? Stop it, please. - [Operator] New York telephone, can I help you? - Please, help. (breathes heavily) She's tryin' to kill me. - Hello? Hello, this is the operator. Can you hear me? What's wrong? Hello. - Oh thank god. (pole smacking) - Hello, can you hear me? (phone beeping) (alert buzzing) (silencer blasting) (bell ringing) - Greenville Springs Police. - This is the operator. I'm getting an emergency. (silencer blasting) (sirens wailing) - Pick it up. Let's go inside. (plane engine roaring) (explosion bursting) (wind whooshing) Everything's quiet here. I spoke to the store manager. Says he hasn't seen or heard anything unusual. I don't think we got the right address. How do you want me to proceed? - [Chief] You're cleared, 10-4. - That's a copy. All right boys, let's go. We're rollin' outta here. (soft seductive music) - One of these days I'm gonna surprise you and actually be on time. - That's okay. I believe all good things come to those who wait. - Why Paul, I always thought you wanted better than good. I always thought you wanted only the best. - That's why I'm here, Carolyn. That's definitely why I'm here. (reporter chattering) (foreboding music) - Betty Jeanne? (Paul shrieking) (sirens wailing) (EMS chattering) - Yeah, I got it. - (whistles) Hey, whaddya say there, partner? I was so comfortable in my bed. - Well at least traffic was light, huh? - Yeah well, she's in there. I already walked through it and Carlino's got the husband over here with the neighbors. So soon as you're up to speed, you come visit us. - Okay. - Okay. - Detective. Detective Freedman. - What? - I just wanted to say I'm real sorry about screwin' up the way I did. It was stupid. - What was stupid? - You see, I was the first patrolman on the scene and he had blood all over his hands. And when he asked me if he could wash it off in his neighbor's bathroom, I said it would be okay. - Who are you talkin' about? Solomon? - Yeah, the husband, Solomon. - Well you're right, that was very stupid. - [Officer] Get that thing over here. (radio chattering) - Can you please tell me what you're doing? - Sure, it's called a paraffin test. It'll tell whether or not you have nitrates on your hands. That comes from discharging gunpowder. - Does Carlino know he's already washed? - I figured we had nothin' to lose. - Look Mr. Solomon, I think we kept these nice folks up long enough. Whaddya say we finish this down at headquarters? - Could someone please do me a favor? Call my attorney. His name is Gary Pillersdorf. He's listed in Scarsdale. - Sure, we can take care of that for ya. - Mr. Solomon, could you change into something else please? The forensic guys might need those. - Lieutenant. Lieutenant? - Officer Desalvo, what can I do for you this time? - Sir, you asked me to let you know when the coroner had bagged the victim. - So? - Sir, he's done that. He's leaving now. - Thank you. (soft somber music) (EMS muttering) - What'll I tell my daughter? What'll I tell Kristan? - One more time. At the bowling alley Mr. Solomon, how many games did you bowl? - I didn't say that. - And did you bowl well? Remember your scores? - I didn't say that I bowled. I told you that. - Oh you went bowling, but you didn't bowl? - Yes, that's right. I often bowl on Sundays, but I didn't do it this time 'cause I didn't feel well. I just went to see my friends. - What friends? Do you remember who you didn't bowl with? We'll check with 'em. We'll find out what score you didn't get. - Paul, you have to understand that we are gonna check everything you say. We're gonna check it. All your friends. - Just a second, all right? I told you the truth. I went to the bowling alley. It's exactly like I told you, but I didn't bowl (breathes heavily) and I didn't go home right away. I met somebody afterwards. I met a woman. - Lemme try one. - You sure you have the stomach for it? - If you do, I do. (soft seductive music) Oh god. Mmm. - It's an acquired taste. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, just like everything else. - Wow. Certainly can't top hamburgers and champagne if that's what you're tryin' to say. - I guess I'm just an ordinary girl with extraordinary tastes. - A true contradiction in terms. - An oxymoron. - Like jumbo shrimp. - Or happily married. - Well I guess considering everything I've done, I'm as happy as I have any right to be. - Don't say that. You deserve all the happiness in the world and maybe being with me would make you happy all the time. It could be wonderful, Paul. We could run away tonight, right now. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Where would we go? - Well, you always talked about how much you wanted to go to Puerto Rico. Let's do it. We could go to the airport and leave. (chuckles softly) Why not? - Don't you think this conversation's a bit premature? Last time I checked, I still had a wife at home. - Don't you think you'd like to be married to me, Paul? - [Mike] Now after the dinner, did you go right home or did you stop somewhere else? - No no, I went directly home. I didn't go any place else. - How far's the restaurant from your apartment? - It's a 10-minute drive. - And this restaurant usually stays open on Sunday nights 'til 11:30? - Yes, yes, it stays open. - Paul, we're gonna check with the restaurant. You understand that? - Yes. - We will check with them. - Yes, it stays open. But I didn't go home right away. What happened was after the restaurant, I walked Carolyn to her car. - [Man] (howls) Get a room! (soft seductive music) (lips smacking) - Why don't you come pay me a visit? - (groans) Oh, Carolyn. Carolyn. - Please, Paul. Can I please? - Somebody might see us. - That's what makes it so exciting. (Paul breathing pleasurably) - (sighs) What'd I do? What'd I do? (sighs) What'd I do, what'd I do, what'd I do? What on God's earth did I do? - Here we go, 208. (car horn honking) (door knocking) - [Carolyn] C'mon in, it's open. - [Mike] Whoa. - [Carolyn] Just make yourself at home. I'll be with you in a minute. - Thank you. - Now you see, this is great. - What's great? - All this stuff. This apartment, comin' into the city crack of dawn, out before everybody. - You call that great? - You don't? - No. Go sleepin' late in my own bed, great. This is terrible. - You know, you're a very boring guy. - [Carolyn] Morning, gentlemen. - Ms. Warmus, there's been an incident involving a Mr. Paul Solomon late last night. We'd like you to come down to the Greenville Springs Police Department to answer some questions. - Is he all right? What's happened? - Mr. Solomon is okay. - Is it Kristan? Has there been some sort of accident? - No no no, they're both fine. - There's been a murder, Ms. Warmus. Betty Jeanne Solomon was killed several hours ago. You know Mrs. Solomon? (intriguing foreboding music) - Yes, I knew her. Oh, Paul. Of course I don't mind going with you. I'll just be a minute. I'm sorry. I forgot to ask you fellas if you wanted something to drink, some coffee? - No. No, thank you. Just straight ahead please. - Okay. Oh, lemme help you with that. - Thank you. - Here you go, right here. So that's Warmus, W-A-R-M-U-S? - Right. - Date of birth? - January 9th, 1964. I like your tie. - Place of birth? - Troy, Michigan. Silk? - Address? - 485 East 72nd Street, New York, New York, 10021. - Father's name? - Thomas, Tom. - Mother's name? - Elizabeth. I bet your wife bought it for you. - Actually, I picked it out myself. - Oh. - Can you tell me about yesterday, January 15th? - [Detective] All right. - [Mike] What was your day like? - Well, I was at home all day and then I met a friend for dinner at a restaurant in Yonkers. (police officers chattering) I got there at 7:30. - And that friend would be Paul Solomon. (police officers chuckling) - Yes. - Ms. Warmus, would you follow me please? I think we'd have more privacy inside. - Whatever. - Yeah, what'd I tell you? There you go. (officers chuckling) - We know you did it, Paul. - How can you say that? - [Detective] Look, things are gonna go a lot easier on you if you just tell us how and why you did it. - I didn't kill my wife. I didn't. I didn't kill my wife. - Okay, that's enough! - I didn't kill her. - I'm not gonna let you ask him any more questions. Can't you see he's in shock? - I didn't kill my wife. - Look, my client will be happy to talk to you later, but not now. And just to make sure we understand each other Lieutenant, Paul is not to be questioned by anyone without my being present. C'mon, Paul. - Go ahead, Paul. Go. - Lieutenant, lemme ask you one thing: Exactly how was Mrs. Solomon murdered? I know she was shot, but what I wanna know is how many times. - I'm sorry, counselor. That's privileged information; can't be disclosed at this time. (phones ringing) - Hot coffee. (soft seductive music) - That was in 1987, you first met him? - Yeah. It was the beginning of the school year. We'd both been hired by the Greenville Springs Elementary School. I was a computer science teacher and Paul taught gym. When we first met, it was electric. I wanted him and he wanted me. (barbells clanking) (Paul breathing heavily) - I thought we were gonna meet for lunch. - But I'm hungry now. - Carolyn, this is a boy's gym. You know, you could get in trouble. - I know. - [Paul] I think you should go now. (doorbell ringing) - Carolyn, hi. Mom, dad, look who's here. - Hi. - Hi. - Just got back from shopping and I can't wait to show you what I found. Tada. - Is this for me? - Yeah. - Really? - First rule of skiing: If you're gonna ski good, you gotta look good. - Carolyn, I can't let you do this. I know that's very expensive. - Oh, Betty Jeanne please. I was gonna get it for myself anyway and they didn't have my size. Then I knew it would fit Kristan, I had to get it. Besides, it wasn't that expensive anyway. - Hey, what's doin'? - Dad, look what Carolyn bought me for our ski trip. Isn't it beautiful? - Carolyn. - Hey if we're gonna be ski buddies, we gotta look the part, right? - Mom, can I keep it? Please, please. - [Both] Please. - (sighs) Carolyn, thank you very much. It's beautiful. (Kristan chuckling softly) We were about to sit down to dinner, I hope you'll join us. It's not very fancy. - Really? I would love to. I haven't eaten all day and Paul's always telling me what a great cook you are. - Oh, he is. (chuckles softly) Yeah, I'm sure of that. Paul, can you help me out please? - Sure. - You sure? - Of course. - Great. - So are you a great skier? - I'm kinda great. But then again, I've been skiing all my life. My dad taught me how to ski. - Tryin' to get my dad to do things like that, but he prefers basketball and bowling. - Oh, you've got a terrific dad. I talked to him a lot and I know how much he loves you. In fact, there's been many times I've been jealous seeing you guys and your perfect family. - Yeah, we are pretty lucky, huh? - And I'll tell you something else: When your family isn't around, you can really, really miss them. (poignant orchestral music) - Here we are. - God, it looks like Thanksgiving. Oh, c'mere. Caught with your hand in the cookie jar. (Kristan chuckling) (soft seductive music) So do you love her? (Paul breathing heavily) - (chuckles softly) I don't know, I don't know. - Who's the best? - (winces) You. You. - I can't hear you. Who's the best you ever had? - You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you. - Maybe it was all in my mind. (doorbell ringing) - You gotta be strong. You gotta be strong. (somber orchestral music) - Thanks, Jane. Call me when you get home, 'kay? Hi, Gary. Hi, dad. Where's mom? - Oh, babe. (soft somber music) - C'mon now. You guys know this better than me. It's been over six weeks! This case could have and should've been solved by now. In fact, if that 9-1-1 wasn't incorrectly routed, we might've caught the son of a bitch in the damn act. - Shoulda, woulda, coulda. - All right, okay. Let's review what we do know. We know the exact time of the shooting happened within seconds of 7:15 p.m. Also we know bullet wounds to head, chest, back extremities with penetrations to lungs, heart and liver. We know that the blood samples taken from the murder scene all match Betty Jeanne's. We also know the hair strands taken from the floor and the furniture belong only to Paul, Kristan and Betty Jeanne. And most importantly, we know now that the victim was killed with a .25 caliber gun equipped with a silencer. And that my friend is major. - What're we supposed to figure? It was some kinda contract hit? That's not gonna play. - She wasn't hit by a pro. - Well I wouldn't rule it out. My money's still on Solomon, but I wouldn't rule anything out. Call that what you want, gut feeling, whatever. But that's what I believe. - I'm still not convinced. And Neil, I need your help with somethin'. - [Neil] What? - I wanna subpoena Carolyn's home phone records. - Yeah. - I gotta know if she's still in touch with Solomon and I wanna double check that story that she called in the afternoon of the murder. - All right, I'll speak to Hammel. - You didn't mention the telltale sexual signs of Betty Jeanne. It was only there a couple hours before her death. - So? - So you think Solomon could be so cold he could have sex with his wife in the afternoon, kill her in the evening, then make it with his girlfriend in a parkin' lot at night? - Yes, I do. - Carolyn, it would be a big mistake. - But Paul, it's been months. Can't you understand that I have to see you? - Please, please don't make it any tougher than it already is. - It'll be good for both of us. Can't you see that? Can't you see that we need each other? - Carolyn, I can't. It wouldn't look right. Besides, Kristan and I are just starting to get our lives back together again. - I know. Me too. But if we just... - Carolyn, I can't. I can't see you right now. (crickets chirping) - Okay. I understand. But what if in the meantime, I just sent you a little note every once in a while? Would it be okay if I did something like that? Would you like that, Paul? - Yeah, okay. You can do that. I gotta go. I'll call you. - [Carolyn] Bye. (soft piano music) (water splashing) (birds chirping) (soft seductive music) (dial tone beeping) (phone ringing) Hi, this is Carolyn. I'm not home right now, so please leave your name, your telephone number and the time that you called, bye. - Like I told you gentlemen on the phone, Carolyn Warmus was a former client of mine who hired my firm out to do some work for her. Nothing outta the ordinary. May I ask what she's done? - Never said she's done anything. We're just in the middle of a homicide investigation. Her name happened to come up. We found out in her phone records that she was associated with you. So we just wanna know what, if anything, you know about her. - Interesting girl, but I'm not sure I could tell you anything more than I already have. - Try. - She's a real piece of work. First time I met her, she comes waltzing in this office wearing a short white tennis dress with long tanned legs. Yeah, that's what I remember. (soft seductive music) - Mr. Parco. I'm Carolyn Warmus. - Hello, please. What brings you up here on such a warm day? - I need to hire a private investigator for a personal matter. - How personal? - It's really quite simple. I'm dating a man and he happens to be married. I hope you won't pass judgment on me. - Not at all. Of course not. - He told me he's gonna divorce his wife. I wanna find out if he's lying. - Uh huh. - [Carolyn] And I wanna be sure he isn't seeing someone else. - I see. - You don't have a problem with this, do you? I mean about me seeing a married man. - No problem at all, but it could get expensive. - I suspected it might. - I'll put someone on surveillance. - I'd like to join in. I'd like to watch. - Could get dangerous. - I might like that too. - I bet. His name is Jimmy Russo. He specializes in this kind of work. If I could assist you in any other way, please don't hesitate to call. (soft seductive music) She smiles that big smile, waltzes back out the door. - Can I ask you Mr. Parco, when was the last time you talked to Carolyn, say in the last six, seven months? - She called me every now and then. - Oh yeah? How 'bout on January 16th? We got here that she called you on that date. Can you tell us about that phone call? - She said she was feeling tired. She said something about police questioning her either earlier that day or night. Said they wanted to know something about a murder of a fellow teacher's wife. That's about all I could remember about that conversation. - Nothin' else, right? - Well there is one thing I should tell you gentlemen: a lotta people thought Carolyn and I were foolin' around. That never happened. I mean, she was just infatuated with me because the work I do. Just thought I'd mention it. I don't want you guys to get the wrong impression in case anybody's passin' stories on me. - So that's it? That's everything, right? - That's it. That's everything. - That's it, that's everything. - If you have any question, please don't hesitate in seeking my help. - All men are overgrown, immature children. - And they all the same question, "Was I the best you ever had?" - Oh. - The fact is they're all the same. Now my theory is if you're good, they'll be good. Can take my word for it, girls. I'm not just good, I'm great. - How are things on the Paul front? - Well it's been very difficult for him, so we haven't seen each other in almost four months. Not since, you know. - Yeah. - But I think we're just about ready to pick up from where we left off. - Really? - Really? - Yes and as a matter of fact, I just bought a gift which I think he's gonna love. Would you like to see it, girls? - What did you get the boy? - Well now this is for his daughter Kristan. Sweet, little gold earrings. - Very nice. - And this is for the boy. - Magnificent. - Exquisite. You know of all of my customers, you have the best taste. - So let's hear the card. - It's personal. - Right, read. (soft piano music) - "My darling Paul, just a small token "so you'll know I'm always thinking of you. "I love you. "Kisses, Carolyn." - Lieutenant, I need to know what to do about Carolyn. Now ever since the murder, she's been calling me several times a week. I mean she's been even sending Kristan and I little gifts. She wants us to get together, which I'm not gonna do. She won't stop. What am I supposed to do? - Well sooner or later, you're gonna have to confront her. I mean, there's not much we can do about it. - What'd you tell her last time you talked to her? - Well I didn't tell her we were through or anything like that. I just said that because of what happened, I thought it might be best if we weren't to see each other for a while. Carolyn is not really one to take no for an answer. - Let's go. - Yeah. - You might as well know that I've been dating other women. One in particular. I don't see Carolyn, but I'm dating again. I thought you oughta know. - Lemme ask you something: do you think that possibly your wife was having an affair? - Well she never said anything directly to me, but I had suspicions that somethin' could be goin' on. - Any idea who with? - No, I don't. - You never confronted her directly with this. - No. - Well thank you very much. You've been very forthright. I think we're very close to making an arrest. - I mean, do you believe that guy? I'm tellin' you that whole group up there is nuttier a damn fruitcake. - And no one's gonna believe us when we tell 'em what's goin' on here. I mean while he's makin' it with someone in the classroom, she's makin' it with somebody in the office. It's unbelievable. - I want you guys to nail that bastard. (car horns honking) - Let's grab a dog. - What, are you crazy? - Why not? - You get sick on those things. C'mon. - So you wanna know 'bout Carolyn, huh? That is one ditsy broad. Good lookin' and very smart and a great body, but a little wacky for my taste. You know what I mean? - Your friend Parco told us you did some surveillance with her. What was that about? - No, he's no friend of mine. Piece of melon, gentlemen? - No, it's okay. - Yeah, we did a little surveillance on some married guy. It was nothin' big. Just to check it out, see if he was gonna leave his wife for Carolyn. We followed 'em out to this place called The Sandalwood, somewhere in Jersey, and we took some pictures because Carolyn wanted to get somethin' compromising to send to his wife. The idea was to do a cut and paste job. You know, a little superimposing when necessary. So two days later, I had to go up to her place to get some shots of her. Picture this. - Hi, Jimmy. (sensual retro music) Follow me. I'm all yours. - Let's get to work. (camera clicking) Well anyway, for 'bout the next hour or so, I took a roll of color film in that outfit and a roll of color with a bunch of others. Then she changed into a blue see-through thingamajig and all the time she's laughing and she's makin' small talk. Finally she changes into this black and white tiger skinned something-or-other and she became this cat. (sensual retro music) (Carolyn growling) (camera clicking) - Aren't you excited? - Am I excited? What kinda question is that? - Like suckin' it. No, I'm not excited. She says, "Well maybe this'll help." (knee thudding) (Jimmy wincing) Right in the gazoingas. So naturally I grabbed my equipment. I got the hell outta there as fast as I could and that boys is my Carolyn Warmus story. - Which is a very nice story indeed. But what about the Jersey guy? What about him? Did you ever send him the pictures? - I didn't have to. 'Bout a week later, I meet up with Carolyn to let her know the cut and paste job ain't gonna work and she says to me not to worry. She met some other guy. (retro jazz music) - I need one more shot. Here you go. (coins clinking) That's for you, my friend. - [Bartender] Gee, thanks.

It's beautiful. It keeps great time. I love it. And those earrings you got Kristan, she's crazy about them. - Do you know how much pleasure I got shopping for those gifts? I'm just glad to see you wearing it. - I'll have to get something nice for you. - You don't have to get me anything. I'd just be happy to spend a quiet evening alone with you and I might even cook. - We'll plan on it.

I did it with you in mind. - I just, I can't. (soft piano music) - I need you, Paul. Do you like it? I did it for you and Kristan. (seductive jazz music) (phone ringing) (voicemail beeping) Paul? Since you're still not here and you still haven't called me, I have no choice but to assume you're having car problems and you haven't been able to get to a payphone to call me.

Did she say whether she was callin' long distance or not? - She said she was staying at the San Juan Beach Hotel right here on the island. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. (soft intriguing music) - Are you worried? - No, no. No, not really. So what'd Tammy have to say for herself? - You know, we were just laughing about it. But now I'm starting to get a little worried. Tammy said she received a call from one of my friends who wanted to know where we were staying. Tammy said she felt a little strange about that call, so she decided to call this friend back and my friend said she had never called me. Paul, I'm scared. (Barbara shuddering) - [Carolyn] Hello, is this Mrs. Marie Ballor? - [Marie] Yes, it is. May I help you? - This is Detective Susan Ball from the Greenville Springs Police Department in New York. - What? - Mrs. Ballor, we're investigating the murder of a woman named Betty Jeanne Solomon. - Well... - It has come to our attention that your daughter Barbara Ballor has been dating the victim's husband, Mr. Paul Solomon. - [Marie] Yes, go on please. - Mrs. Ballor, it's important you know that Mr. Solomon is our prime suspect in this murder. We believe he killed his wife by shooting her seven or eight times with a small caliber gun. I thought you might wanna know that your daughter may be in some danger. - [Marie] Well of course, my god. - And that you might wanna help persuade her to end her relationship with this murder suspect. - [Marie] I'll call my daughter right away. I promise I'll do whatever I can to speak to her about this. - Well we do appreciate your cooperation and we will be in touch. - [Marie] Well, you're welcome. - Goodbye. - Bye. (seagulls squawking) (relaxing island music) - Okay, I hear you. Now what exactly would you like me to do about it? It's Warmus time. - The San Juan police are giving us an escort to the airport here and I want you or one of your other officers to meet our flight in LaGuardia and give us an escort home. - Meet us at the gate, not in baggage. - Okay, don't worry about a thing. We'll take care of everything. - Thanks. He says they'll get right on it. (intense drum music) Don't overreact. - I'm not overreacting. - I have a taxi waiting with police escort for you. - We have plenty of time. I'm tellin' you, she's pathological. - One of you is. (soft intriguing music) - All right, c'mon. Let's go, let's go, c'mon. - Yeah. (sirens wailing) (foreboding jazz music) (chalk scratching) - Okay, let's say Carolyn did it. So she makes a date with Solomon, drives over to the condo. Betty Jeanne lets her in 'cause after all, they're such good friends. So a little time goes by and before you know it, Carolyn hits Betty Jeanne over the head with something. They struggle. Betty Jeanne manages to crawl to a phone. She dials 9-1-1. Carolyn shoots her a few times. When she's layin' there in a heap, Carolyn calmly comes over, places one foot on her back and puts four or five more slugs into her. Now that's what you're tellin' me, right? - That's exactly what we're sayin', yeah. - Oh this is good. Okay so then she dusts herself off, turns out the lights, goes out on the balcony and drives herself to her date with Solomon all dressed up, all relaxed and hungry. Sits down, eats a nice juicy cheeseburger, has some champagne and then makes it with the guy in the parking lot. And all the while never conveying any signs that she just killed his wife. - Works for me. - What's the matter with that? - Prove it. - Okay, let's go to the blackboard. What do we got? Alibi: none. Motive: jealousy. Mental state: deranged. Personal history: repeats obsessive relationships with married men. Always with married men. - Don't forget her recent stunt with Solomon in Puerto Rico. - Repeated phone calls with Paul Solomon, Pillersdorf, Barbara Ballor, Barbara Ballor's mother. As a matter of fact, when she called Barbara Ballor's mother, she mentioned that Betty Jeanne was shot seven or eight times. And like we have always said, who could possibly know that but the killer. Thank you very much. - Something just came in and if it's what I think it is, I might be making your week. - Why don't you let me decide that for myself? - I took a call a short while ago from California, a Rocco Lovetere Jr. Said he might have some information regarding a murder investigation. Thought it might be important for us to know that a private investigator from Manhattan, a fellow named Vincent Parco sold Carolyn Warmus a .25 caliber handgun equipped with a silencer. - Thanks, kid. You might've just made my week. - Well I'm just doin' my job, officer. That's all. - (exhales) Well, this case just turned with a vengeance. (soft intriguing music) - What, am I under arrest? - I'll get right to the point, sir. We understand from Mr. Rocco Lovetere Jr. That you had in your possession a .25 caliber handgun fitted with a silencer shortly before the murder of Betty Jeanne Solomon. - Which is illegal in this state. - We have very good reason to believe that that gun was the murder weapon. - Information in which you previously and knowingly withheld from us. - Now the way I see it, one of three things happened: You either gave or sold the gun to Carolyn Warmus and she killed Betty Jeanne Solomon herself or Carolyn Warmus set you up with the victim's husband, he ended up with the gun and offed his wife or she paid you to commit the murder and you killed Betty Jeanne Solomon in cold blood. - It was either her, her and her husband or you. Pick one. - Look, I gotta level with you guys. You're right about that gun. I had it made for her because Carolyn asked me for one. She paid me $2,500. As God as my witness, I honestly had no idea she was plannin' on usin' it to kill anybody. I mean, she told me she wanted it for personal protection. That's all I know. That's the truth. - (snaps) Guys, take it apart. - Am I gonna be arrested? - No, Mr. Parco. You can walk outta here anytime you want. - We're just gonna take some of your records with us, that's all. - Can we work somethin' out here? (door banging) (Carolyn shrieking) - Ms. Warmus, we have a warrant to search for evidence connected to the murder of Betty Jeanne Solomon. - Wait a minute. Do you mind telling me what the hell you're looking for? - Ms. Warmus, why don't you have a seat right over here. (cutlery clanking) - That's it. That's the judge's signature right there. - Open everything and look good. (soft intriguing music) Clear it up, Joey. - (whistles) Partner. Check this out. But first, listen to this: "Dear Paul, please understand that this "is a very difficult letter for me to write. "For the past several weeks, "I've repeatedly attempted to write a note "which would implicate myself in Betty Jeanne's murder. "But not being privy to all the information "a real murderer would have has always impeded me. "Therefore, what do you think of the idea "of my sending you some signed notarized blank pieces "of my stationery? "You can then type in "whatever you think would satisfy the police." Whoa, there's a first. The suspect leave somethin' laying around and then we're supposed to go sniffin' off in the other direction. - Ooh, get a load of this. It says, "Things to remember: suicide note," with an invite list to her funeral and some very specific instructions. "Please bury me in something sporty, "perhaps even my favorite white tennis outfit. "I always thought it made me look cute and sexy "without being cheap. "I would like to have my hair combed "in either a pageboy or ponytail. "I often wear it that way while playing. "I would appreciate it if you would bury along with me "a photograph of Paul, Kristan, my sister and brother, "my mother and dad and my favorite stuffed animals: "Mortimer, Alphonse and Little Fluff." (jail cell door clanking) - Carolyn Warmus, you are charged with murder in the second degree of Betty Jeanne Solomon. How do you plead? - Not guilty. - [Reporter] Ms. Warmus, can we have a comment for the press please? - Ms. Warmus. - Ms. Warmus? - [Reporter] Ms. Warmus. Can we have a comment for the press please, Ms. Warmus? - Just be bothered for a comment. How do you think you'll do today? Just a comment. - I think it's too soon for any comment, but I'd like to say that I'm glad to be here and I think justice will be served. Thank you. (reporters chattering) (people muttering) - You have got to be kiddin' me. She looks like she just stepped off a plane from Hollywood, bodyguard and all. - Warmus does White Plains. (chuckles softly) - Thank you. - [Bailiff] All rise. - Good morning, gentlemen, Ms. Warmus. Are we ready to begin? - [David] We are, Your Honor. - [Sean] Yes, Your Honor. - Bring in the jury. (soft intriguing music) - [Sean] Kristan, tell us about your ski trip with Carolyn. What'd you two talk about? We talked about a lotta things: how excited I was about skiing, boys. We talked about my mom and my dad. You know, they fought about her. She didn't think my mom liked her very much. - [Sean] Why? What lead you to believe that she didn't think your mom liked her? What'd she say? - Well Carolyn asked me, "Your mom doesn't like me, does she?" And I said, "No no no, she does like you." But in the back of my mind, I knew that my mom didn't like her at all. - [Sean] What else did Carolyn ask you about your parents that weekend? - She would ask me about my dad, what people thought about him, stuff like that. And she would tell me what a wonderful father he was and what a great man he was and what a great teacher he was. All I could say was, yeah. - Kristan, could you tell us about your relationship with your two parents? - Well my father was basically an overprotective father, not wanting his little girl to grow up. But I was very close to him. I always have been. My dad is a very loving man and very warm and my mom is not, was not. - Did you love her, Kristan? - Yes. - [Sean] Do you miss her? - Yes, very much. - Mr. Parco, when you explained to Ms. Warmus that it would take six to eight months to get a gun with a silencer, how did she respond? - She said it was too long to wait. She wanted it faster. She definitely wanted it faster. - Well now if Ms. Warmus wanted a gun purely for protection as you stated, why do you think she wanted a silencer? - Well the silencer might've been my idea. I mentioned to her that if you're gonna practice with a gun and you're not on a range, it makes a lotta noise. On the other hand with a silencer, she could practice in relative obscurity. - What'd she think of this idea? - She said it was a great idea. And from that point on, she became obsessed with getting a gun with a silencer. - And were you eventually able to get her such a gun? - Yes. It was a .25 caliber Beretta Jetfire. I believe I gave it to her the first week of January 1989. - No! (weeps) No! - Counselors? (people muttering) (Carolyn weeping) - It's okay. - Do you have any idea what's going on? - I'm not quite sure, but she hasn't been feeling well, Your Honor. This morning as my assistant was driving her here, she fainted twice and she was vomiting up blood. - Well do you believe Ms. Warmus will be able to continue today or would you prefer that I just... - Lemme talk to her. If it's all possible, I preferred it to continue. Carolyn, don't be sorry. - Vomiting, right. Lady's startin' to lose it big time. - Carolyn c'mon. You got this, all right? - Your Honor, we're ready to continue. - Very well. Mr. Hammel. - Go get him. - Mr. Parco, did you have occasion to discuss this gun with Ms. Warmus on January 16th, 1989? - It was during this conversation that she described to me an incident which had occurred the night before where she was questioned by police officers from Westchester 'bout someone who'd been bludgeoned to death. - She said bludgeoned. - I specifically asked her if the person was shot. She said no, they were bludgeoned. - [Sean] And it was during this conversation that you asked her about the gun? - Yeah, I did. I asked her what she did with the gun I gave her and she told me I could come and pick it up. Then she calls me back and she says I didn't have to come. So I asked her, "Why not?" She told me she threw the gun away on the parkway and that was the last time we had a conversation about that gun. (people muttering) - Thank you. - [David] Mr. Parco, for your testimony, do you request and were you granted immunity by the State of New York? - Yes, I was. (people muttering) - [Paul] It's my wife, I think she's dead. Please, I need help. - [Operator] Calm down, what's your name? - My name is Paul Solomon. Please, please help me! - Where are you, Mr. Solomon? - For god's sake! - Where are you? - [Paul] We're at the Scarsdale Terrace Apartments in Greenville Springs. Now please, get here! - What happened? - My wife needs help. She's not moving. She's covered with blood. For god's sake! (people muttering) (Carolyn sobbing) (David whispering) - Mr. Solomon, from the time of your wife's wake until late May 1989, did you ever see the defendant, Carolyn Warmus? - No. I mean, I talked to her various times on the phone, but I never saw her. She did send me lots of notes and cards, but I never responded. - Did there come a time after June 1989 that you did indeed see her? - Yes. As I remember the evening, it was in late July. I was playing at a basketball league in Manhattan with a bunch of other old men. (chuckles softly) I knew that I'd eventually have to see Carolyn again. I knew how much she meant to me. So I decided since I was near where she lived, I'd stop and see her. I got there just as she was coming back from a golf lesson and she was somewhat surprised to see me because we hadn't seen each other since the wake. She invited me up to her apartment. But I didn't feel comfortable with that, so I invited her to go for a drink at this single's bar just down the street. - And she accepted? - Yes. And the thing I remember most about that night was that at some point I turned to her and I said, "Carolyn, "I hate to ask you this question. "As difficult as it is, I have to know the truth. "Did you have anything to do with Betty Jeanne's death?" And she took both my hands in hers and she said, "I'm so glad that you feel comfortable enough "to ask me that question. "No, I didn't. (people muttering) "I could never do anything to hurt you or Kristan." Well we continued to talk and I told her that it had been so difficult and it had been terrible and how guilty I felt because of the fact that I'd been with her the night that Betty Jeanne died. - Don't you dare follow. (people muttering) - [Judge Carey] Continue please. - Go on, Mr. Solomon. - I always felt if I'd been there at home, I could've stopped what happened. - Did you go back to Carolyn's apartment that night? - Yes. She redecorated and wanted me to see what a wonderful job she'd done. - Were the two of you intimate? - (chuckles softly) To tell you the truth, all I remember is a long, very passionate kiss and then I told her that we could never see each other again. And that thought upset us both very much. (people muttering) - Ms. Warmus, step forward. A defendant has a right and an obligation to be present at all stages of the trial. This means you may not leave this room without my permission. Is that understood? - What if you're at sidebar? Am I allowed to come up? - If at any time you absent yourself willfully without my permission, I will issue a bench warrant whereby you will be arrested and taken into custody and brought here. - What if I deliberately stay away? - Sit down! (people muttering) - Please. - Mr. Hammel. - I really have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Solomon. Your witness. - Mr. Solomon, referring to that night in late July 1989 when you surprised Ms. Warmus with a visit, is it true that after you went to the bar that you returned to Carolyn's apartment and the two of you had sex? - No. No, I don't believe so. - [David] You don't believe so. - [Paul] I honestly can't remember. - You mean you can remember having sex with her on the night of the murder in January 1989, but you're having difficulty remembering whether or not you had sex with her a full six months later in July of 1989? - I simply can't recall. Now I'm trying honestly to remember, but I just can't. (people muttering) - You don't remember commenting on how Ms. Warmus' lingerie happened to match her clothing? - I might have! It's very hard to resist Carolyn. - Let's change the subject to something easier for you to remember. Mr. Solomon, is it true you knew that by testifying, you would be granted immunity? - Yes. Yes, I was told that. (people muttering) - You would get immunity from being prosecuted as the killer of your wife, right? - You mean prosecuted for the crime that was committed, yes. - That's what you wanted immunity from, right? - Well it's hard to want something for something you haven't done. - You know you could've waived immunity, right? You could've signed a document that said, "I don't need immunity," right? - Correct. - But you didn't. - No, I did not! (people muttering) - Mr. Solomon, you earlier testified that on the night of the shooting, you had promised your wife that you would return home early. Isn't that true? - Yes, it is. I did. - [David] But you didn't get home early, did you? - [Paul] No, I didn't. - And you didn't because you knew there was no reason to keep that promise because your wife was already dead. - You know, for you to make that kind of statement is so obscene and so horrible. I mean the fact that someone can manipulate facts or words or half-truths or incomplete reports and to throw up some kind of vague vision of something, it's obscene and so disgusting! I mean, I accept my guilt for this affair. But for you to make that comment, for you to throw that kinda light on me, I only hope to God that when I'm judged and punished that you're judged and punished for what you've done here. - God will have to punish you, sir. The State of New York can't because you made an agreement for immunity. (people muttering) (soft intriguing music) - I'm sorry to report. We have a hung jury. (people chattering) - Oh great. (gavel banging) - Silence! Silence in the court! Silence! The defendant will remain free on her $250,000 bond pending a decision by the district attorney's office as to how they wish to proceed. (gavel banging) (people chattering) - All this for a tie. - We gave him everything, a motive, the gun, the ammunition. (soft soothing music) - [Woman] Ms. Warmus, Ms. Warmus. - Nobody cares about me. Nobody cares at all. - I'm sorry, Mr. Warmus. But I told you before, it's impossible for me to continue if they decide to retry Carolyn. - [Tom] You are putting me in an untenable position, sir. - (sighs) Look, I appreciate that. But I've done the best I can and I will continue to make every effort to help in the transition with whomever takes over her defense. I just, I hope you'll understand. - [Tom] I don't think so. I'm afraid that's just not good enough, Ms. Lewis. (phone beeping) (David sighing) (people muttering) - Mr. Aaronwald, welcome to our little group. I'm sure in no time at all you'll be as familiar with everyone as I am. - I'm sure I will. - I met Carolyn Warmus when we both worked at Roam Telecommunications in Manhattan. - [Sean] Ms. Kattai, when you worked with Ms. Warmus, did you work in close proximity to one another? - Yes, we did. Our desks were right next to one another. - [Sean] Was there a common locker room? - Yeah, there was. The girls would meet there before and after work. It's a good place for a smoke. - [Sean] Would you describe to us the incident involving your driver's license in August of 1988? - It disappeared from my locker. That's where I kept my purse. I don't know exactly when it was taken. I just noticed one day that it was gone. I didn't think much about it at the time. - [Sean] Now Ms. Kattai, was there any money taken from your purse? - [Luesa] No, that's the funny thing about it. The only thing that was missing was my driver's license. - During our investigation of Ms. Warmus' phone records, we discovered that on the morning of January 15th, 1989. - That's the morning of the evening that Betty Jeanne Solomon was murdered. - Yes, sir. On that morning, we discovered that a call had been placed from Ms. Warmus' apartment to Ray's Sports Shop in Plainfield, New Jersey. - What was the significance of that phone call? - Well further investigation disclosed that later that day, a woman fitting Ms. Warmus' description purchased a box of .25 caliber Winchester bullets from that store. - That's the same brand and caliber as was used to murder Betty Jeanne Solomon later on in her home. - That's correct. - Now detective, citizens purchasing firearms ammunition in the state of New Jersey are required to provide proof of identity and to sign certain disclosure forms, are they not? - Yes, sir. - Can you please tell us the name of the woman who signed for that ammunition at Ray's Sport Shop? - Yes, sir. The lady's name was Luesa Kattai. (soft intriguing music) (people muttering) - Your Honor, the prosecution rests. - The defense calls Tom Warmus. (people muttering) - Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in the cause now pending before this court is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? - I do. - You may take a seat. (soft orchestral music) - You're Carolyn Warmus' father. Is that true, sir? - Yes, I am. - Mr. Warmus, would you please tell the court about a telephone conversation that you had in the summer of 1989? - I was at my home in Franklin Hills, Michigan, when I received a call from a gentleman who identified himself as Vincent Parco. He said he was a friend of my daughter's. I mean she was running around with some shady people. We'd be in trouble. He then offered to help me, but that it would cost me big bucks. He said (speaks faintly). - Daddy, daddy, watch! Daddy, daddy, watch! Daddy, watch! Daddy, daddy, watch! Daddy, watch! Daddy! (water splashing) (poignant jazz music) Who's the best, daddy? Am I the best? - You are, princess. - [Judge Carey] Carolyn Warmus, you have been found guilty of second degree murder in the death of Betty Jeanne Solomon. Before imposing sentence, do you have anything to say? - I stand before you an innocent person and this is very very difficult for me. I am accused of making phone calls to a gun shop in New Jersey, which I never knew existed. - I'm sorry, I can't hear you. - Your Honor, I never phoned Ray's gun shop and I never went there and I never stole Luesa Kattai's license. I never owned a gun, nor did I ever borrow one from Vincent Parco. I would never do anything to hurt Kristan or Paul Solomon. And I can promise you that I did not kill Betty Jeanne Solomon. I'm innocent of this crime. I am innocent. I could never do such a thing. - [Judge Carey] I can't hear you. - So please. Your Honor, please don't hurt me for something I couldn't do, something I wouldn't do. I wasn't brought up that way. If I'm guilty of anything, I'm guilty of falling in love with a man who deceived me, who made promises he couldn't keep, never intended to keep. I have nothing more to say. I thank you for this moment. (poignant orchestral music) (Multicom Jingle)
