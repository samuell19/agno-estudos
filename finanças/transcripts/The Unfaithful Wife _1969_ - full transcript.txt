Are you married, are you divorced? I am divorced. I have been married for 5 years. It was really a trouble. Your children, is it your wife who keeps them? Yes, they are better with their mother.

I will go to the taxi stand on foot. It is raining. * Here, the impossible union * spheres of existence is an act. * Here, the past, the future, are conquered. Reconciled. I missed the 7 o'clock train. There was no taxi. I had to take the bus. I waited 30 minutes at the station. What a horror! I'm going to have a drink. You should have called me at the office. One would be returned together. I did not know anymore what I was doing. I'm going to make you a big beard. I'm going to make you whiskers. He is a man. He is a little man. I'm leaving. You do not go down to Paris today? No, I stay with my little man. - My friends are coming. You think Will they bring me gifts? Do not be very interested. I brought in a conjurer. 200F, that's fine. Hurry to come back tonight. Yes. Good bye. * Bell. M. Victor Pegala? - What is it about? - Rest assured, I am not a representative, neither a tapper, nor a bailiff. It reassures me, without answering my question. It's very difficult to answer it. You would be wrong on the meaning of my approach. Do it anyway. I am Helen's husband. - Oh there! - No no no ! Make no mistake about my intentions. Well, give me time to be a little stunned, still. Well, come in, I beg you. Sit down. You want to drink something? A whiskey, I do not mind. Scotch or bourbon? Bourbon, for once. Yes, the morning is better. Thank you. - Now, let me explain. - Yes, please. I do not know if Helen told you that we live together d 'a very free way. We love each other, but we understood that we needed not encroach on our reciprocal freedoms. - You follow me? - Yes, - very good. - In short, there is between us a complicity that you surely understand. I keep her informed about my life as she tells me hers. So I wanted to know you. Listen ... I'm delighted. A little ... A little surprised: I was not considering your relationship this way. But I find it amazing. - Really? - Ah yes ! Yes ... Yes. You know, we always have a little scruple of ... From ... To sleep with a married woman. We are afraid of stories, salads, stuff .. Finally, me, anyway. But there ... You reassure me. Even more so that you are a case - a bit special . - - Oh? Helen has many adventures. Finally, without exaggerating. This is not Nini Paws-in-the-Air, but it rarely lasts more than once or twice. You are a privileged person. Oh, you know ... I only know her since 15 days, 3 weeks ... Mm ... How to did you meet? Excuse me, you have fire? No. Yes, I have fire. I do not smoke, because of ... Lighter. I never smoke in the morning. It happened quite by chance, in the movies. I was sitting next to her. I felt some sort of ... Availability. You know what it is, of course. In any case, the film was bad. We moaned together. Then we went out take a drink to give us back. The next day ... I gave her my address and she came, simply. It's very funny. Oh, you know, it happens every day. And ... How are you doing? Excuse me? Are you happy? Oh, well ... Not bad. Yes, not bad, not bad. Finally, without stories. Now, I understand why. Oh yes? You do not lift him in the sense of sin. No. That is true. He laughs. She's a good little girl. - We have been married for 11 years. - Ah yes ? We have a son. Yes, I know. She told me all that. Do you want another drink? - Gladly, thank you. - Sorry. It serves it. Oh, you're in luck so arrange yourself with your wife. Me, I was married with a bother. Oh ... Terrible. Terrible! I suspect so. He laughs. You know what do I prefer about Hélène? This is his ... Sweetness. Short laughter. It does not look like this, but ... She is extremely sweet. And soft. This is very nice. Do you live in the suburbs? NearVersailles. It's not a problem to come to Paris every day? Oh ... We make it a habit. I'm going to give you something that you may not know. It's a nightmare for Helen. Let's go! Really ? Yes. A girl like that must not live far from Paris. She chose the campaign. She told me it was you. - Do you often talk about me? - No, very little, very little ... The situation does not lend itself to it. In any case, in my opinion, you should live in Paris. Or here. Neuilly is almost the countryside. How manypieces, here? Oh well ... It's not very big. I have this living room. I have a small room. A very nice bathroom. And I have a kitchen. Closets, wardrobes, ... You want to visit? But I do not mind. Like that, I can imagine it better. Are you a little perverse? No! It's entertaining. So, it's over here. By that. That's the room. That's it. It's not huge, huh? Returning to Helen. Frankly, I find it very pleasant. Do not believe that I am in love with it. It's very hard for me to fall in love. Yes, I believe ... What are you looking at? Ah! You recognized it! Helen gave me a gift. According to her, you had forgotten her existence. Why did you give it to her? That, I do not know anything about it. Maybe to have fun to herself. But you, why did you give it to him? For our 3rd birthday wedding. We lived then rue de Grenelle. You had not sprained. She chose it. Oh good? Here, come here. He throws him on the bed. I can not anymore. - What are you saying? - Excuse me ... I feel unwell. - What happens to you? - I do not know. The head is spinning. This is whiskey. You may not be used to it. - Sit down. - No no. Thank you. It will pass. You ... You want an Aspro? No, no, thank you. God, - you have a funny face. - I know. * Strokes. * Falling from the body to the ground. * Bell. * Two bell rings. * Someone whistles "Fascination". * Doorbell. * He whistles. * The factor moves away whistling. * It starts. * It closes. * A car brakes and hits his. Shit! Why did you slow down? That's fine, let's exchange our addresses. - 2 seconds. - You're welcome. - You are wrong! - I've seen you ! Too fast ! Go for a ride! I saw you! I am fully insured, give your address. - Nothing to do! - But I'm an insurer! Do not make me waste my time! - I make a statement. - Gentlemen. - Nothing broken? - But no ! * Brouhaha. Who has a pen here? Say, your safe ... It is stuck! But it's nothing! It's sheet metal! He does not care, he is insurer! Me, I make a statement or I will still be in my pocket! I'm always in my pocket! He does not care, he is insurer! Listen! Shut up all! - You put "Safe". - You're welcome ! Go, go around, gentlemen! * Brouhaha. What did you see? How are you doing? It's not my job! Yes, yes, of course. * Air bubbles. * Voices of children playing. What a pity that you were not there for tea time! Unable to arrive earlier, I had a snap. Yes, you are all pale. Do you want to drink something? My husband, Mrs. Thomas. Nice to meet you. My respects, madam. I will serve myself a whiskey. Antoine, the son of Mrs. Thomas, is Michel's best friend. - He is adorable. - Not always. It works less well than yours. It could soon be the opposite. Excuse me. * Bell. Oh! Hello Madam. - Is my husband still there? - Yes Madam. Hello. Hello, Helen. What a good surprise ! We had not seen each other for at least 8 days. - Can you bring me back? - Of course my dear. Have you had a good day? Yes ... But tiring. I am completely tired. She sighs. We can leave, I'm done. You're late, Dad, I'm done. I have it for 2 minutes. I'm driving you. Bah! There are 300 meters. Go, hello! - Hi, my son. - Tonight, mom. Tonight. Do not you take an egg? No thanks. I'm just going to drink tea. - How are you, your headache? - It's finish. You do not go down to Paris today, I suppose? No, I will stay a little rest. It will not hurt you. - Do not you take a toast? - No thanks. Nothing. When you have a headache, it cuts my appetite. Tonight. Madam, I need some money. Go up to my room, I'll give you some. I will make veal liver, at noon. As you wish, I am not hungry. Calf's liver. It's good for you, and it's safe to eat. Very good. Calf's liver * Weak moans. * There is a knock on the door. - It's me, ma'am. - Can I enter? - Yes. Two gentlemen want to see you. See me? What do they want? I am tired. They are police, ma'am. The police? - But why? - This I do not know. I told them I was going to warn you. Tell them I'm going down. Well, ma'am. Gentlemen. I'm sorry to disturb you. Police officers Duval and Gobet. Madam. Forgiveness for my dress, I am ill. I decided not to go out. I am all the more sorry, ma'am. We will try to be as brief as possible. Please follow me. - Sit down, I beg you. - Sorry. I come so directly to the fact. Do you know a man named Victor Pegala? Yes. Finally, I know him a little bit. Why this question? Do you know where he is? Oh no, I do not know. At home, I suppose. Do you know his address? He lives in Neuilly, right? We have found your name and address, among others, in his address book. Then we ask all whose name is written on this notebook if they know where Mr. Pegala is. But I do not understand. Did he do something wrong? He had an appointment the day before yesterday with his ex-wife to pay him alimony and get organized for the children's holidays. Since it is notnot come, she worried. No one at home. Then she tried several times to call her, no answer. Then ... You know it ... Oh no, not at all. A leading woman, it seems. She came to see us yesterday. But I do not want to bore you. I will have just 1 or 2 questions. When did you see Mr. Pegala for the last time? My faith ... I can not tell you. Yes ... I understand. Well, sorry for the inconvenience. You are suffering. But we are moving forward. In ... By groping. You understand? I do not want to disturb you any longer. If by chance, it would surprise me but do we ever know you had news, please call me at the judicial police, Police officer Duval. Or ... Gobet Police Officer. * A pendulum sounds five strokes. Do you believe something has happened to him? This survey is systematic. But it is not impossible that it is a murder. I am reproached for my vision too pessimistic tothe existence, then ... Please excuse us again to have disturbed you. It's daddy. Good evening. Good evening. Ah! Ah! So what? It going ? I can not find this piece! How are you? It's better now. You want something to drink ? Yes, yes. Do not bother you. * It is used. I had a police visit this afternoon. The police? Nothing important, but finally ... What was it? - A vague relationship that has disappeared. - Who ? - You do not know, Victor Pegala. - Not know. He is a writer. I even know more where I met him. Do you want to drink something? No. Thank you. But why did they come to question you? He had my name on his address book. - Ah ... compromising! * He's laughing. Oh, listen! I'll see where the meal is. Are you coming to help me, dad? How is it done that this piece is not found? - I do not know, my son. - I tried them all. - Maybe she misses. - Perhaps. Oh, this puzzle! You only talk about that, that's enough! - You have to talk about something. - Shut up ! * Crunch crisp. I do not know if we can keep Brigitte. - Why? - Since the story with Paul, it can not stand any more observations. Of course. It is annoying because of that. He can not hold back. It is not so bad, it has other qualities. * Chips. Why would someone disappear all of a sudden? Eh? This man who has disappeared, it is not normal. I do not know, sweetie, it must be happening, I guess. - Has anyone disappeared? - Yes, the piece of your puzzle! * We will meet Mr. Grimaud with Léon Zitrone. Here. * TV sound in the background. Try that one. Listen, it's not possible! But if, the proof! - It's nowhere! - Calm down ! - You have hidden it! - But no ! - If! You are a bastard! - No but ! You call me a bastard, you're not crazy? I will calm you down! - You have hidden it! - Go up to bed! No! Oh, this puzzle! I have enough ! That's enough ! No! Go to bed! You are crazy, both of you. I hate you. * Bell. What is it? I do not know. These are the gentlemen this afternoon, ma'am. Enter them. Get them in! Madam, we are still bothering you, at a late hour and I apologize. I do not know what to say to you. Introduce you to my husband Good evening, sir. Police officers Duval and Gobet. - Gentlemen. - Sir. And here is my son going to bed. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening, dad. Good evening mother. Good evening, my son. * Television in the background. Madam, sir, I had to come back tonight because some points we remain obscure, and you may have the possibility - to light our lantern. - Excuse me. * - Good evening everyone. You know Mr. Pegala, ​​sir? No. My wife told me about your visit. No, I do not know him. Good. Madam, I must ask you an effort of memory. Where did you go knowledge of Mr. Pegala? But I already told you. I do not remember at all. Please, search. I do not know! Has a literary cocktail. Yes ... Which one? But I do not know! Julliard. Julliard. Finally, I do not know. How will I remember? I understand that it must be very difficult. Sir, were you attending this cocktail party? Yes. It seems to me, yes. So maybe did you meet Mr. Pegala? - This name does not tell me anything. - Want to see her face? I have a photograph on me. If you want. No. His face does not tell me anything. Madam, is it him? Yes, that's him. Have you never been to his house? No. I knew him really very little. I do not know why he wrote down my address. Maybe you find it to his liking. Maybe. Tell me, Inspector, I would not want to look anxious, but whatever the reasons, this kind of interrogation is unpleasant. You must do your work, but it's almost 10:00. Yes, you are right to remind me. This kind of disappearance is always boring. I draw here or there the elements that can help me. You have never been to Neuilly, you, sir? How so, in Neuilly? I mean at Mr. Pegala's. But I do not know him and I do not know anything. Yes, I know you know nothing and ... It does not make things easy for me, believe me. I'm sorry about that. What do you want me to do? Good! Well, I do not want to bother you any more. You do your job, I understand. Yes. And that kind of thing, it's the wound in our business. I'm going with you. Thank you. Please. Dear sir, I hope I do not have to bother you yet but I can not promise you. - Understand me. - Yes. Goodbye, Inspector. Come, I fixed the damage. - What damage? - Come. Look! You forgive me? Oh, I love you! * Song of birds. Again the gentlemen of yesterday! Yes. I will go see what they want. I love you. I love you. I love you like crazy.
