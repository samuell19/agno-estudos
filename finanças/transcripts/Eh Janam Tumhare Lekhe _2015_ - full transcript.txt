But we... We're disrespecting it. And we're happy to do so. We're insulting it. Mind your step and keep your distance. Please be careful. Keep your eyes on the floor. Mind your step, stay away from the edge. You crazy man. People are celebrating Janamashtami, and you have plonked yourself like a pole in the middle of the road. -Move! -Officer, I'm protecting the treasure. Bhagat Ji, it was a nightmare arranging this wooden board. -The job's done, keep the bricks. -The bricks are down. Now that the treasure is covered, we've got nothing to worry about. If anyone would have tripped over, it would have been fatal. Forgive me, I've mistaken you for someone else. It's okay, it always happens. Do you think that I'm crazy or something? I must be mad to stand here guarding this manhole for so long. It doesn't matter, the job's done. Let's go, come on. Stop, my good man. Take me to the college. It's expensive to take the rickshaw, do you have any money? -Yes, how much do you want? -Two rupees and 50 paisa. Okay, I'll pay it, but I need to collect this cow dung first. If delivered to the right place, I can turn this filth into wealth. Do you expect me to give you a ride with all that filth? All done. He left me. Strange, I told him that I was prepared to pay. Great, I can take the horse drawn carriage. -Stop, stop! -Yes? -I want to go to the college. -Do you study or teach at the college? For now I'm a student, how much will it cost to go there? Exactly five rupees. Okay, I'll pay you five rupees, under one condition. We will need to stop several times on the way there. We'll stop when I spot cow dung or stones, and I'll pick them up as we go. I agree, but I too have a condition you must meet. Please don't go to the college, go to the mental asylum. Okay. Bhagat Ji, we've been looking everywhere for you. Get on the scooter, let's go to the college. I'm not getting on that. If I had my way, I would have motorcycles banned. Okay, we'll go by foot. Go get some water. Bhagat Ji, we've been waiting for you with flowers, but you're busy scattering manure. The flowers in these garlands and bouquets grow from this very manure. Keep an eye on the flowers that bloom from where I've spread it, the manure will be extremely fragrant. -Bhagat Ji, your water. -Good. Bhagat Ji, if only everyone could start thinking like you. Then why don't you? It costs nothing at all. -Let's go. -Yes, let's proceed. The job's done, my son, let's go. I'm a servant at the Guru's house. I also serve at the Pingalwara. I'd like to thank you all for the flowers. However, once the stem breaks, the fragrance of a flower dies. I want... that fragrance to last forever. It should live forever. Did you think... that I was here to preach you? No, I'm here to converse with you. Because... the heaviest burdens... and the biggest problems can be solved through a simple conversation. These values were instilled in me by my mother. She used to tell me to tread carefully... or else you'll kill the ants. God resides in the ants too, and the earth belongs to them as well. Ram Ji! Ram Ji, be careful. Slowly, slowly. You'll fall if you aren't careful. Be careful, you'll fall. See, you've hurt yourself now. You made the little ant spill her flour. Now what will the poor ant do? She was going to knead it into dough and make chapattis for her children. Who's hurting the most, the ant or you? -The ant. -Yes, the ant. If only someone had left the stone in a different place, my Ram Ji wouldn't have tripped over and fallen, and the ant wouldn't have spilt her flour. Isn't that right? That's why whenever you encounter bricks, stones or nails, you should pick them up and move them aside. -So that-- -Aside? Yes, so that nobody else can trip like Ram Ji did. It also means that the ant won't spill her flour. Isn't that right? But people are just walking by, nobody picks them up. My dear son, someone has to take the initiative, don't you agree? My dear son. Your mother loves you to the moon And back... -Ram Ji, could you bring me the lamp? -I'm coming. I would give my heart My spirit everything... Here you go. For your pure love my baby Mum, why are your hands black? My son, in order to let off light, the glass must be wiped clean. Understood? Okay, listen, did you know that both darkness and light live together in the same lamp? My dear son is as bright as the moon. I'll lull you to sleep And you'll gently sway away I'll lull you to sleep And you gently sway away The birds are here to look at you My precious beautiful baby For your pure love my baby I would give my heart my spirit Everything for your pure love my baby Ram Ji, wake up, my dear son. Look, the rooster wakes up before you every single day. All of God's creatures are chirping and calling for you. -Get up, my son. -Mum, I want to sleep a bit more. Tell them to be quiet, I want to sleep. They're not going to be quiet, they look forward to you feeding them. Right? Come on, I have put some seeds in the basket. Go and scatter them on the terrace. If you do, I'll give you something special to eat. Mum, what will you give me? Sweet chapatti? Yes, sweet chapatti. -But first you need to feed them. -No, I want the sweet chapatti first. Feed them first. -Feed them first. -No, I want the sweet chapatti first. First feed the birds, then I'll give you the sweet chapatti. Here, hold this. Go, go. Move it, move it. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Praise the almighty Lord. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Praise the almighty Lord. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Praise the almighty Lord. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Praise the almighty Lord. Give it to him. May you live long, dear son. May God bless you with a long life, lasting peace, and the best education. Did you see how many blessings you received from Baba? Baba Ji, please give me the bell. Here you go, boy. Do you remember what I said about Bhole Nath? He didn't sleep until every living creature on this earth was fed. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Praise the almighty Lord. Are you feeling good? What has your mother sent you to beg for today? She made pudding, it's for you. -Oh, really? What's the occasion? -It's my birthday today. Your birthday? Why were you even born, you illegitimate child? If I had my way, I wouldn't let you or your mother in this house. What's all the fuss about? His mother has sent this sweet pudding to try and rub salt into my wounds. What are you talking about? She's only sent you some pudding. It's so sweet, it's like venom to me. Tell this boy to go away, and that he shouldn't come back. You bastard, didn't you hear what my mother said? Get lost. You have no idea what's going on. Ram Ji, give me the sweet pudding. Mehtab... are you leaving the house for good? I want to earn my own living. Aren't you able to take criticism? Now you want to go and wash people's dirty utensils? The entire business has been destroyed by the epidemic. How will we pay for Ram Ji's education? You should've considered this before. You gave birth to him against my will. Your words insult my womb. I'm not trying to insult you, I'm just trying to make you realize... that the path you have chosen to walk... Just don't assume that I will support you. I don't have a choice. Let me make one thing absolutely clear. -If you consider coming back tomorrow-- -Listen to me, both myself and my son will never, ever return to be a burden on you. Yes... I'm forever indebted to you... for allowing me to bring my child into the world. Son, you're a piece of my heart. I live for you. If I had my way, I wouldn't let you out of my sight for even a minute. However, I won't let my maternal instinct enslave me to the extent that I ruin your life. That's why I'm taking you to the hostel. Mother, will you be cleaning people's dirty dishes? I can help sweep the floor. No, why would my son sweep floors? You're my little prince. Mother, is it important to get an education? Whether it's important or not, I'm not so sure. I want you to be able to go to university. You'll do it, right? Come on, I'll drop you at the hostel. Letâ€™s go. Mehtab Kaur, your son's now a good looking young man. But why has he been looking so sad since he's been back? The thought of failing his exams are getting him down. My dear son, God creates good avenues to earn a living, even for the people who fail their exams. Dhanwant Kaur, if he's not so good academically, let's find him a profession. Boy, if you want to get a job, then make sure you let me know by the evening. Stay there with your son, Mehtab Kaur, he's been gone for a long time. I'll get you something to eat and drink. -Come sit here and catch up. -Okay. Mom, I have failed to fulfil every single wish of yours. My son, all my wishes are with you. Anyway, the matriculation exam isn't like the great Kumbh festival, it doesn't take 12 years until you can take it again. Come next year, you can resit the exam. Mother, I don't feel like resitting the exam or even working. I don't even want to return to the village. -You've never mentioned returning. -What should I do? I can't stay with you. All I see is darkness all around. I'm feeling so confused. Both of us are homeless. My son, God's home is our home. When the road ahead isn't so clear, we must put our trust in God. He'll show us the right path. Come and see me my love Without you I'm nothing Come and see me my love Without you I'm nothing I can't even sleep... Son, you were once very sick. The fever just wouldn't go. Then, I prayed to the Almighty to bless you with a long life. He will help you. You haven't failed, my son. Waheguru, I hand over my son to you. If you're with him, I have nothing to fear. Come and see me my love Without you I'm nothing I have no desire for food or water I'm dying from the pain of our breakup Without my husband How can I find peace? I've offered my prayers to the Guru If it pleases him We shall become one Mom, your forehead is burning. Yes, my son, the fever doesn't appear to be shifting. I'm constantly thinking about you. I was so anxious. Last night, I kept dreaming of you. It was like you were calling out to me. I was calling for you, my son. Let me take you to the Dera Sahab Gurdwara, Mom. I'll look after you every day. There's no way out anymore. I'm jobless. I don't want to be a burden anymore. Come on, dear sister, don't say that. How are you a burden? Joy and pain are inseparable parts of the body. You have been such a great help... but now it seems... as if my time has come. Don't make such disheartening statements. You have to live a long life. Your son needs you. You must look after your mother. If you need anything, just ask me. Mom, from now on, I won't leave you alone for even one minute. Son, just once... one last time, take me back to my village. Take me to Rajewal. I don't know why, but my mother is insisting on going to Rajewal instead of the hospital. Oh, God. We were so late reaching Rajewal. The front door of the house was locked. -Grandma! -Please open the door. Grandma, please open the door! Open the door. Mom. What happened, Mom? Oh, God. I've left some money with Mahant Teja Singh. Swear that you won't spend... a single paisa on yourself. -I'm a sinner. I'm a witch. -No, Mom. You don't understand. I was a widowed virgin before... your father gave me shelter. He promised that he wouldn't have a child with me. He asked me three times to have an abortion. But when you were in my womb... was during a time... a plague had enveloped the village. I bought this medicine for you, why haven't you taken it yet? -I'm not taking it. -What do you mean? -Don't force me. -But we agreed, Mehtab. Our agreement has made me a murderer instead of being a mother. I've told you that you won't give birth to this child. Life and death are matters best left in the hands of God. A child won't be born from your womb in my house. -That was our agreement. -It was your decision. Please reconsider what you're saying. Look outside. Bodies are being burnt in every field. People are praying to stay alive. Yet you want to murder my child before it even comes into this world? I don't want to bury my flesh and blood. In the name of God, allow my child to be born. Okay, but this child will never be my legal heir. It won't get a share of my assets, that's final. Mom, Mom. Son, why are you sitting here? Sai Ji, Mom's gone. Yes, I've just heard. Sai Ji, she was so sad when she departed. Did she mention anything to you? I wish she had told me about it a long time ago. I have not yet tasted The taste of divine love I have not yet tasted The taste of divine love... This is from the guru's blessed kitchen. This is from the guru's blessed kitchen. It's from the guru's blessed kitchen. Use both hands. From the guru's blessed kitchen. Waheguru, I have seen you serving here for years now. This service has been assigned to me from God's own abode. I'm God's servant. May God reward you for your selfless services. What's your name? My Grandma had named my older brother Ramji. So my mother used to call me Ram Ji, too. You two are like mother's to me, call me what you wish. Here, take some bread. Kheer Waheguru Ji... have some kheer. This poor child is disabled, he can't eat with his own hands. We have brought him here to drop him off at the orphanage. Waheguru. We want you to admit this child into the orphanage. -Who is this child? -This child is our responsibility. His mother passed away two months ago, and his father left him with us and ran away. -We don't know what to do. -We've walked a long way to get here. Okay, but this orphanage is a home for orphans. We aren't able to take care of a child with disabilities. We can't accept him here. Where should we take him then? You will have to make arrangements for him elsewhere. What do we do? This problem is stuck to us like glue. It is, buddy. If we return home with him, our families are going to throw us onto the streets. We could leave him here amongst the beggars and walk away. What do you think? The crippled don't live too long anyway. He will pass away within a year or so. Then why don't we finish him off and leave? -The matter will be resolved once and all. -Wouldn't that make us sinners? The Gurdwara will deal with him. If not, they'll be the sinners. Ji Giani Ji. You've served at the Guru's house for many years. You have spared no effort in serving the poor, the sick and the needy. Seeing the selfless service that you've rendered... I thought of you today. I'll do what you say. With the shelter and support from Sri Guru Arjun Dev Ji... today, I'm entrusting you with a big responsibility. You will raise this child. Yes. I'm so fortunate, Giani Ji. From now on, you're his mother and his father. Today marks four years since my mom passed away. You've marked the occasion by giving me an invaluable gift. Bless the Waheguru. I will give this child as much love and affection... as my mother gave me. I have not yet tasted The taste of divine love... Come, please come. Come. Very good. I've waited so long for this love I've waited so long for this love... Come on, let's take a bath. Come on, let's have a bath. We'll have some sweetmeats after. Now you're all clean, let's eat sweetmeats. What's on your mind, son? You're always sitting on your own. To be a widowed virgin is a curse. -Getting a divorce is a curse. -Who are you referring to? Mother. My mom. She suffered so much grief. She swallowed so many insults. She lived in pain and anguish. But she never forgot about her kids. She didn't deserve all of this. It was my father who was sinful... not my mother. Mom, I will consider every woman my mother from now on. Your little arms around my neck Made me sway to the tune of love I swayed to the tune of love For my dear baby For my babies pure love I would give my heart My spirit my everything Everything for your pure love my baby Pyara is, Pyara isn't. Pyara is, Pyara isn't. Pyara is, Pyara isn't. Pyara is, Pyara isn't. Sai Ji, this is my new toy. God has given me a toy. Waheguru, Waheguru the king. I pray that this invalid is able to live a long life. He's my toy... and I can't live without him. I don't want anything other than this invalid boy. I want nothing more... and won't ever need anything more. Why is there blood on the rabab? Where is the rabab's owner, Sai Ditta? The rioters appeared from nowhere... and killed Sai Ditta. I was sitting next to his body, holding the Rabab when Muslim rioters happened to come by. Perhaps they thought I was also a Muslim and spared my life. Finally, the police and the army came and took his body away. Oh, Pyara, oh, Pyara! Come here my dear Pyara. You should clean the rabab, and keep it safe inside. Incase we're both destined to die... I hope God takes you first... so that I can save your corpse from the feeding crows and the dogs. Waheguru, Waheguru. Don't discuss such things in the Waheguru's house. It's not the time to mourn, but rather to show some courage. Yes. It appears as though the curfew isn't going to be lifted. It's been three days now, the children are suffering because they're hungry. No, Giani Ji, don't worry. I'll help improve the situation somehow. I'll take Gurmukh Singh to the langar hall, we'll cook chapattis and pickles, -and serve them to people. -Okay. -This situation seems to be getting worse. -Let's do it. -Gurmukh Singh Ji, light the wood. -Yes. -I'll prepare the dough. -Good. Gurmukh Ji, Gurmukh Ji. Are you okay? Come on, come on. It's safe. Bhagat Ji, all of the arrangements have been made for your trip to Amritsar. The taxi is here, and the food is ready at my place. Don't leave without having a meal at my house. Principal, sir, I can't take a taxi. They pollute the environment, we'll walk to your place. The station isn't far from here anyway. We'll walk there. Thank you, it was a great experience. Come on, let's go, we've had a good time here. Welcome, Bhagat Ji. Dear, please tell your aunt to lay the table. Okay. It looks like you've moved into a poor man's home. A poor man's home? It looks like a store house for wood. Why's there so much wood? My children wanted a lot of woodwork in the house, so I put it everywhere. Please take a seat and enjoy your meal. Eat, I won't even take a sip of water in this house, -let alone eat any food. -What happened, Bhagat Ji? At least tell me what I've done wrong? Wrong? You have ripped out the lungs of the poor, and adorned the walls and floors of your home. Have you ever planted a sapling with your own hands? God forbid if you needed it, you'd buy oxygen if you could. How will the poor breathe? All of this because of the children? How foolish. What a foolish man, just because the children insisted. -And he calls himself a teacher. -Bhagat Ji, please listen to me. Bhagat Ji, you're such a fast walker, I had to literally run to catch you. Oh, madam, that's why I never take the rickshaw, they're so slow. In your fit of rage, you came without eating, please eat now. No, madam, you eat, I'll get something on the way. I can still manage, even without food. Bhagat Ji, I don't cut down trees, please eat my food. You don't understand, what with the amount of tree's we're destroying... we're inviting floods, and upsetting mother nature. We're tempting fate. You preach day and night, people will start to listen eventually. Oh, no, they do understand, but these fools will never learn. Let go of all your concerns for a while and eat. Staying hungry like this is tempting fate. -Here, eat. -Okay, give me some. -You worry about me a lot. -You worry about everybody. Bhagat Ji, when I get home and tell everyone that I met you, my family are going to be so impressed. May God bless you with a long life, you have great values. Bhagat Ji, I'll come to see the Pingalwara. Do you think it's a zoo or something? It's a home for the homeless. If you wish to come, then come to serve and not to see. Come here, Sardar, come here. Move up a bit, please. Why are you carrying this broken glass? So that it doesn't hurt my mother's foot. Or cause an injury to someone. Great, but who are you? Have I got you confused with someone else? It's common that people confuse me with other people. We usually become friends after that. We became friends the moment we sat together and struck up a conversation, -but what's with your style? -Original, isn't it? Why are you wearing a bell around your neck? So that you'd ask me about it. See, it pleases everyone. But please tell me the actual reason, why do you wear it? I ring this bell to attract people's attention to my Pingalwara. And to seek help for the sick and the disabled. So you're the Bhagat Puran Singh Ji? No, no, just do this. That's nice. I'm a big admirer of your services to mankind, but since this is the first time we've met in person, can I ask you a question, Bhagat Ji? Yes, you're an advocate, of course you can ask me a question. What made you start Pingalwara? An invalid in Lahore had become almost like a garland around my neck. After the partition of 1947, we came here. In the refugee camp at Khalsa College I noticed that... the handicapped and the sick people were suffering. Everyone is reminded... They were getting thinner and thinner. ...that registration is mandatory. We need your name and address to register. Here you go, you can go to the camp. -Greetings. -Greetings. Yes, young man, we need your details and all of your property and possessions. I have one rupee and five anas in my pocket. Even if you didn't have him, that wouldn't have mattered. Do you have any other relations or family members? I once had a mother, who has since left. She left for heaven. This invalid on my shoulders, my Pyara, he's all I've got. He was four years old when I got him, and ever since I've worn him like a precious necklace around my neck. This old man is sick, he's treating me like I'm his son. I got him here. You did a good thing. Here you go, straight ahead to the camp. This is a notice to everybody in the Khalsa College refugee camp. Due to a sudden increase in numbers, we urgently require volunteers to come forward and help us. We request that you come forward and help us right away. What happened, Baba Ji? Are you feeling okay? If not, and you need something, let me know. I'm not feeling well, son, my heart seems to be sinking. I will be very grateful if you could bring me a bit of juice. Please just ask, I'm here to serve. Take two rupees and get a bottle of juice. I will get it shortly. Let's go, Pyara Ji, let's go. Pyara's horse is going for a run. Here you go, Baba Ji, some chilled juice for you. I had to go up to Putligarh hence why I'm a little late. I bet you were thinking that I ran away with your two rupees. Come on, Pyara Ji. What happened, Baba Ji, are you angry? Why aren't you speaking? Take some of this juice, perhaps it will calm you down. I have some savings. You must promise me... not to spend a single paisa out of that money on yourself. Mom, today I realized... why you strictly forbade me from using the money... you had kept aside for your own cremation. What should I do with the rest of this old man's money? I have some money with me. It belongs to an old man who passed away. I was wondering what to do with it. I was wondering what to do with it. Then, I remembered Gurmukh Singh. Please take the money. You'll be able to buy things for the kids. No, brother, your needs are no less than ours. I'm using it for the needs of my sister's children. Keep it, sister, keep it. God will take care of you. The refugee camps of 1947 have long since ended, but there is no end to the suffering of the refugees. Oh, God, there was so much bloodshed and killings. Has the country attained freedom or has it been destroyed? Since the partition, nobody seems to take any responsibility for the cripples and invalids. They are rendered homeless and are suffering. It won't be like this forever. God has asked me to build a home for them. -Bhagat Ji. -Yes. Am I right, Pyara? Pyara, Pyara. Is that right? To arrange some chapattis I had to beg from door to door. But now I don't have to. People have started giving them away every morning and evening. Yes, brother. Thanks to your efforts I have been able to help serve them. But, Bhagat Ji, you've been washing the dirty clothes of patients for years now, and you never let us touch them. I don't consider them dirty. All I see is their suffering, it reminds me of my mother. Since I've been taking care of them and cleaning their clothes... I've never felt any repulsion. I see my mother in amongst these cripples. I see my brothers and sisters in these invalids. They died before they were born into this world. Bhagat Ji, I'll go and sort the chapattis. Bhagat Ji, it's going to be cold and we don't have enough warm clothes. -How will we survive? -Okay. But I only have one bank, it's God's Bank. He issues checks at his will. Okay, Bhagat Ji. Leave Pyara with Bhano, I'll pick him up on my return. Come here, my lonesome goat, your buddies have already moved on. Here you go, Madam Bhano. I'll leave my Pyara with you again today. Pyara's is ours, too. Come, dear son, I have cooked these especially for you. Great, it's a treat just for you. He makes us laugh, and he keeps us busy. That's good. What should I do? I feel helpless. I can't leave him alone, and to collect the money I have to travel great distances. If I don't speak to him for a while, he gets upset. Pyara, I'll be back soon. Is that okay? Dog, dog. Oh dear, dear... Let him go, he has to collect some money for you. I'm indebted to you for this favor, how will I ever repay you? You take such good care of Pyara every single day. Why are you saying that? You're the most selfless person ever. He can stay with us, it's not a big deal at all. Don't worry about him, he'll be fine, just like our corn. Right? -Do you want some corn kernels? -Okay, I'll go. Sure, sure. My dear, do you want some popcorn? Donations for the lame, and the invalids and Waheguru will bless you. Donations, donations. Donations, donations. Come here, Bhagat. I know that you need some food. Here, eat something. No, my brother. My children are hungry, why should I eat? I haven't even managed to collect two rupees yet. Who does that child belong to? Is he with anybody? He's an orphan. Someone just left him here at the station yesterday. Okay. In that case, he's my child. Come here, my child. Come here. Bhagat, he's been laying there since yesterday. Come here, my child. He hasn't even moved, or said a single word. He must be hungry, quickly, give something to eat. -Here you go, Bhagat. -Here it is. -Eat this. -Water, water. Water? Get me some water. Do you want some water? Hurry up. Very good, very good. Water, water. Oh, little boy of mine, what's your name? He only says "Unni-Unni," nothing else. He says he has eaten food and has had some water. Water, water. Bhagat, he's your child. You understand him. Come on, Uni Maani. Come on. Let's go, I'll take you to see Pyara. Brother, if someone comes and asks about the boy, send them to me. If someone was going to come, he wouldn't have been dumped like this. -He's a part of your family now. -Come on, Uni Maani. It's getting windy. Bhagat Ji, it's going to rain. God bless. What will happen to the patients under the Banyan tree if it rains? Waheguru, please provide them with shelter and protection. -Chain... -Yes, Bhagat Ji. -Take Pyara and Unni Manni inside. -Yes, Bhagat Ji. -Be careful, don't let them get wet. -Yes, Bhagat Ji. I will quickly go and make some arrangement for the patients. Yes, Bhagat Ji. -Take care of these things, and my books. -Yes, yes. It's okay. Slowly, slowly. Be careful. Put it down, come on. Don't just stand there, come on. Very good. Good work. Gently, come on. Lay it down. Come on, let's go again. Come on, get up. Bhagat Ji, I have some bad news. Unni Manni had a really bad fever... and he died. My children... no matter how much help you need... you can ask for all the help in the word, but don't die on me. I can't bear this. Yes, tell me. Look, we have served you many notices. This building has been sold. You have to leave. Are you just evicting people? Is that all you do? What about trying to rehabilitate the sick, helpless and homeless people? You have to leave. I have paid for this building, it's mine. Where should I take all of these sick people? Will society refuse to take responsibility of them again? Who do these sick belong to? Is it my mother and father? Look, you cannot keep TB patients like this in the open. It's dangerous, anyone could get it. You very well know that it's a contagious disease. So you accept that anyone can catch this, but you're failing to consider that it can be treated. The patients could be healthy again. If I contracted TB, would my mother abandon me? If it took me one year instead of a month to die from it, would she have strangled me to death? I can't let my patients languish on the roads to die. See, Bhagat Ji, you must understand the limitations of the government. Your government can't even understand the helplessness of my patients. That's why I'm compelled to break the law. I won't be leaving this building. We shall see, I have spent 100,000 rupees on this. I don't care about your 100,000 rupees. You listen to what I have done. I have followed Gandhi Ji's principles, and have been a part of the struggle for independence. I'm an advocate of good things. What have you done? You've licked the boots of the British. Bhagat Ji, we're well aware of your selfless service. But what are we supposed to do? Get hold of some poison, I can't watch my patients die like this. Whether one is suffering from TB or cancer, or anything else. Okay. I will speak to the government. I will ask them for some land where you can build the Pingalwara again. Bhagat Ji, what's going on with these empty burlap sacks? They're screaming for some flour, or we should get rid of them. Wow, the sacks have turned poetic. We must find some flour for them then. But, Bhagat Ji, where will we get the flour from? The bins are empty. Don't worry, we'll sound the bell. Let's go. Now people have started calling you a "devotee," it's time to start acting like one. Pick up your cauldron... and sound the bell. With an iron cauldron in my hand And a brass bell around my neck With an iron cauldron in my hand And a brass bell around my neck The hungry helpless Old and the crippled The hungry helpless Old and the crippled Look towards you with hopeful eyes I must go on to seek money for them... Chain Singh, can you come here? -Coming, Bhagat Ji. -Come, come. I was feeling a bit tired. Until the day we stop breathing, we can neither be exhausted nor distraught, understood? Bhagat Ji, you have created a huge pile of these bricks and stones that you got from the roadside. My good man, there are two things I do with great interest. Firstly, picking up stones and bricks from the road so that no one gets injured or knocked down. Secondly, picking up lame and crippled people... so that nobody can do damage to them. I understand, Bhagat Ji, but what do you intend to do with these bricks and stones? Hey, silly boy. These will be the foundation of the new Pingalwara. Good. Give the homeless have a home Give them an identity Every time he prays to God He asks him to bless those Who're suffering PINGALWARA, AMRITSAR And those who're in overwhelming pain With empty pockets And those who're in overwhelming pain With empty pockets There's no other option I must go out to seek money for them I must go out to seek money for them Please make a donation. Why don't you leave me alone, how many times have I said no? But you keep coming back. Don't you feel ashamed when you beg? You're strong and able-bodied, God has given you hands and feet. Go earn a living. God has blessed me with hands and feet but not family members. What do you mean? How big is your family? Around 150 people, all of them are disabled and sick. Okay, come here. Come. -Here you go, come by every month. -Okay, thank you. Bhagat Ji, we've arrived at the railway station. We're here? Okay, Bhagat Ji. Good, good. No, I want to play. -Get in. -I want to go and play. Get in! Stay there. -If you say that one more time... -I want to play. -...I'll cut your legs off. Stay there. -I want to play. -You mad woman. -I want to go. Shut up or you'll be punished. You're not going anywhere. But I have to play. We'll go in the evening. Look what I have got for you. Chapattis and some sweetmeat. Eat as much as you like, okay? You're not allowed to go outside, though. -I want to go, I want to go. -You're not leaving, sit down. -You're not going. -I want to go. Get inside. -I want to go. -You stupid girl. I want to go, I want to go. I want to go. I want to go out and play. I want to go, I want to go. I want to go out and play. I want to go out and play. -I want to go out and play. -What happened, sister? What do you think? She's just a poor girl. This man treats her like a dog, and locks her in there every single day. He's as heartless as an executioner. Do me a favor, try and get her to the Pingalwara. What are you suggesting? How can we break into someone's house and send his wife to the Pingalwara? -I want to go out and play. -What do we do? The men go to work, and we're here listening to her scream all day. What do we do? The poor girl is pregnant. Oh, my God! Someone should kill that man. Bhagat Ji, we're from the Sadar police station. A complaint has been made against the Pingalwara. How dare you take my wife to the Pingalwara? The Pingalwara has been built for the homeless and the poor. She doesn't need your support, I'm always there to help her. But who are you? That is what I have come to tell you. Bhagat Ji, we hold you in high esteem, but you need to return his wife to him. He will then withdraw his complaint. The matter will be settled for good. We won't leave until you give her back. -I'm going to eat a chapatti. -Madam, tell me one thing... how can this woman be his wife? Did he marry her in a Gurdwara? Has he even married her? I will do as I wish, who are you to interfere in my personal affairs? It's not just a personal matter, it's a matter for humanity as a whole. This young woman has the brain of an eight-year-old child. She doesn't know what's going on. You have forced her into being a mother. Does she even know who her husband is? But I know that I'm her husband. What have you ever done for her? I picked her up from the street, brought her home, gave her shelter and two meals per day. Oh, bravo, great. In exchange for two chapattis you've exploited her like the beast you are. You aren't married to her anyway, that allows you to throw her out of your house at your convenience. She's carrying my child. She will deliver a child courtesy of your lust. She doesn't need lust, she needs compassion. She does not need your shelter, she needs a hospital. Tell me one thing, why don't you take her to the hospital and get her some treatment? I'm not responsible for all that. But I have taken the responsibility on, I will get her the treatment she needs. She's not just a helpless animal, who will always succumb to your lust. She's a daughter. A daughter of Pingalwara. Bhagat Ji, don't do this. We'll use force to resolve it if necessary. Inspector, as I've said, she is now a daughter of the Pingalwara, if she leaves here, she will do so only after he finally marries her. Have a proper ceremony, and we'll be happy to let her go. What does she know about ceremonies? She's mad. She isn't mad, you're the mad one who thinks this helpless woman has to bear your children for merely two chapattis. -Bhagat Ji, listen-- -No, madam. You need to listen. You can protest all you like, you can even call the army. I will not hand over this girl to that beast. Bhagat Ji, how are we going to resolve this matter? Okay, if he doesn't want to marry her... he must write a will stating that her child will inherit all of his assets. -How could I possibly do that? -You can't seem to do anything! -Mohindro. -Yes. -Take our daughter inside. -Yes, Bhagat Ji. Get up, let's go. Inspector, feel free to go ahead and do what you need to do. Arrest me. Put me behind bars. Do what you have to do, it doesn't matter. What matters is the one thing that I have made clear to you, and that is that the Pingalwara's daughter will be staying put. Let's go, Sardar, we'll think of something else. Here you go, madam, I have done as you asked. We've put her breast in hot water before pouring the milk in the bottle. It's important to do that, -we don't want the baby getting sick. -Okay. Keep the nipple covered and protect it from the flies, okay? -Now, feed that baby some milk. -Okay. -There's a clever girl. -Bhagat Ji. Bravo. In the name of God, no. -You don't need to do that. -Greetings. -It's good you bandaged him. -Yes. Bhagat Ji, I think that this place is in dire need of nurses. Madam, we need a lot of things. However, this Pingalwara doesn't need employees, it needs people who're willing to help with love and care. Yes. -Tell me one thing. -Yes. This bandage is so neat... have you done a course in nursing? Nursing and medicine. I'm a qualified doctor. I'm on holiday, so I came here to help out. Bravo, bravo. That's so nice of you. You're the kind of person that this Pingalwara needs. Bravo! Bhagat Ji, our entire family worships you. -My father has a clinic in Sangrur. -Sangrur? Yes. In that case you must be... -Dr. Harbans Singh's daughter. -Yes. A Pingalwara donation box has been installed at the clinic. Whenever your workers come in to take the collections, they leave lots of books for us. Our entire family reads every word of them, and then we try to follow your teachings. -I'm glad to hear it. -Yes. My worker informed me that, at your house, -you help those who need help. -Yes. There's a round the clock langar, right? This is the influence of your teachings only, Bhagat Ji. Excellent. After meeting you, I'm eager to meet your family. It would be great if you came to visit. -Okay, tell me one thing. -Yes. Is it your first visit to the Pingalwara? Yes, it's my first time. I'm not here to see, but rather to serve. -Bravo, I trust that you'll be a big help. -Yes. Look who it is, it's Bhagat Ji. -My respects. -There's no need for that, sit down. Bhagat Ji, I have come to make a donation of 100,000 rupees to the Pingalwara. Sit down. Chain Singh, tell the cashier to bring me the receipt book. Bhagat Ji, I'm in no hurry for the receipt, I can take it later. Please take... 100,000 rupees and... get me a receipt made for 500,000. After I get the receipt, I will send another 100,000 to you. Have you come here to make a donation or to tax evade? It's not that Bhagat Ji, I just heard that the Pingalwara was struggling a bit. It's going through a difficult phase. Okay, let's do this. I would like some land right next to Pingalwara I would like to build a market place. You'll have a regular income source, and I'll open a few shops, what do you think? The Pingalwara runs on grants and donations, not with shops. I would prefer to ask for 1 rupee per month from 100,000 people, than taking 100,000 from one person. I thank you for your offer, and thank you for coming to the Pingalwara. Bhagat Ji, perhaps you've misunderstood what I meant. The thing is, the day I start worrying about the Pingalwara, is the day that God will stop worrying about it. I'll take some leave, Bhagat Ji. Sister, don't lose heart. You'll be better in a couple of days. Bhagat Ji, someone has left this baby on the doorstep of the Pingalwara. Give her to me. She's great, wow. Mohendro, a new daughter of ours has arrived. She's so small, barely two to three days old. Bhagat Ji, how are we going to raise her? Once she's been at the Pingalwara, how will she live without a mother? She's starving, but can't eat so much. Hand her to me, Bhagat Ji. Why are you making my daughter cry? Let go of her, what are you doing? leave her alone. Wait, Mohendro. Bhagat Ji, she's crazy, she might drop the baby. No, Mohendro. She's not mad, she's a mother. Her Ruhani died a month ago, but her instincts don't die. Maternal instincts don't die. Come here, Bhagat Ji is going to solve your problem. Come here. Stand here, but let me do the talking. Bhagat Ji, he's asking for an advance and some leave too. Give him it. But, Bhagat Ji, he's lying. He took some leave and an advance six months ago. Six months ago he said that his mother had died. -He's using the same excuse again. -Really? -Do one thing for me. -Yes. Sanction him both the advance and the leave. -Okay. -It must be very serious if his mother has died for a second time. But, Bhagat Ji, he's the same guy who instigated the strike against you. That was his misconception, I thought he was my son and he thought I am the owner and that he's just an employee. The relationship of father and son-- This had to happen now, didn't it? You can't depend on this power supply. Please make a call and ask when will they resume the supply. Okay. Come on, let's go. Bhagat Ji, there's no electricity anywhere in the city. The phone lines have gone dead too. -Is that so? -Yes. Bhagat Ji, the army has surrounded the Golden Temple, a curfew has been put in place. Everything has come to a standstill. How unfortunate. After seeing and hearing about what's happening around us, I've decided to protest against the government... I'll do this by returning my Padma Shri award. Bhagat Ji, the mistakes have been marked on this advertisement, how many copies should we print? -Okay, print 5,000 copies. -Okay, Bhagat Ji. -Bhagat Ji. Bhagat Ji. -Yes. A lady has come from Delhi to interview you. -Greetings. -Greetings, take a seat. Go ahead. Bhagat Ji, by returning such a huge honor bestowed by the government, aren't you expressing your support for the terrorist movement? Madam, I only support the destitute, the diseased and the crippled. I'll continue to do that. And as far as the issue of terrorists is concerned... my question to them is that... since they're trying to protect people with their guns, -where are their Sikh values? -Then who are you supporting? The one who believes in saving lives, not taking them. What do you think about the situation? It's most unfortunate, it's very bad. Mistakes were made by the militants, and mistakes were made by the armed forces. Mistakes were also made by those in power, such as the politicians. but who was it who lost their lives? Who perished? The innocent and the faultless. In the fields, in their homes, on the bus, at university. Why are the youth dying? Why? But, Bhagat Ji, Hindus are also being pulled out of homes, shops, buses and so on, and are being singled out and killed. Oh, madam, Hindu, Sikh... Madam, I was born in a Hindu family. The values my mother taught me during my childhood were meant to conjoin the two religions, not to separate them. This sapling of Sikhism was planted in my heart... by the services rendered to the poor, the suffering, the diseased and the crippled. It just grew from there. I drew strength and took shelter in the Guru's teachings and his home. What is the deepest regret, and who's to blame? The insult inflicted on the respected Golden Temple. The violation of its sanctity and purity. It's the government who're solely responsible for that. Madam, my discontent and protests aren't directed at one person. It's against the government. It's against all of the politicians. Bhagat Ji, Ruhani used to love going to school, but today she won't go. I'm not going. I won't go to school ever again! God bless her. What's wrong with school? Tell me why my daughter won't go to school. At school, all of the kids tease us because we're orphans. They ask what my mother's name is, sometimes even my father's. A particular teacher even said that only orphans go to the Pingalwara. -Greetings, Bhagat Ji. -Greetings, madam. Madam, this girl was barely three days old... when someone left her on the doorstep of the Pingalwara. Was that her fault? If a child cannot be born without a mother and a father, then how can she be an orphan? Those parents are bastards for dumping their child without telling anybody. -I apologize, Bhagat Ji. The other kids-- -Madam, you're a teacher! It's your responsibility and your moral duty to educate children and safeguard their tender hearts from being mauled. These destitute children have both a mother and a father, who is very much alive. Write it down on your register, Bhagat Puran Singh. All of this means... we will have to open our own schools for our children. PINGALWARA, PINGALWARA CHARITY BOX, CHARITY BOX PINGALWARA Bhagat Ji, you're so late. Pyara is very annoyed with you. -He's not going to let you off today. -Help me God. Look, Pyara. Bhagat Ji's here. Is my Pyara angry with me? -Forgive me, my friend. -Today he's not going to forgive you. Oh, my Pyara. Is Pyara angry? I'll touch your feet and seek forgiveness, pardon me, my friend. Pardon me, my friend, I'm sorry for being so late. Dog, dog. He's all smiles and laughter now.

Sir, I need some grains. Take as much as you want, regard it as your own shop. That's okay, sir, but kindly remove the no credit sign first. Truthfully, you're the reason it's there. Please pay the outstanding bill and then take what you need and pay me in cash. Bhagat Ji, I rushed over as soon as I received your letter. Why was it so downbeat? I was worried, what's wrong? These days I feel like I'm on the verge of becoming paralyzed... by losing a leg in an accident... and being left to die on the side of the road. So that's what was wrong. Bhagat Ji, nothing will happen to you. Neither paralysis nor an accident. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm certain. Even God is aware that, if something ever happens to you, he would have to take your place. God doesn't have that much time on his hands. For no reason... a four-year-old child... has awakened inside of me. Someone has snatched something from my hands, it was a bowl of pudding. They threw it away. Mother. Her memories have come back to life. She used to embrace Triveni, and cry her eyes out. What happened, Bhagat Ji? -What happened? -Devastation... and destruction. Destruction. The earth is going bare, the trees are rotting... the rivers are drying out. The birds and the animals are perishing. The fumes from the vehicles... are suffocating the earth. The top, the ozone layer... is punctured. What can the poor do, Bhagat Ji? You're so mindless, don't you understand? It's like you're constantly asleep, will you ever wake up? Bhagat Ji, we have to wake up in exactly four hours. You won't rest, though. You'll be picking the nails and bricks up, and distributing pamphlets. Bhagat Ji, even God must take a break sometimes. But you never take any leave. It's because I am the emperor. Emperor? That's great. A cauldron in your hand, a bell around your neck, a turban on your head, and Pyara by your side. You're blessed with royalty. Now that I'm concerned for the whole world... doesn't that make me the emperor of the world? Lala Ji, why did you refuse to give the rations to the Pingalwara? Lala Ji, I didn't refuse, I just refused to give them credit. If that is the reason, Lala Ji... then here are the documents to prove I own my house, please value it. Here's a list of supplies. Weigh the rations and get it delivered to the Pingalwara. Now, this is what I call a good deal. Leave it with me, I will send the rations to them. -Okay, Lala Ji. -Mangu... Oh, true God, you're never hungry. But your mortals are. I have handed you the controls. You can perform countless amounts of miracles. You can give life to a stone. Why should I worry myself? Why should I worry myself? What do you think, Pyara? Our problem is solved, the job is done. We finally have an answer. Pyara, you have a divine smile. I know it all too well. I must be mad... to be worrying about food. You're here, after all. You're the one who's always by my side. You're my shield. During my childhood, my mother told me about your presence. I continue to see you everywhere. How many birds have taken flight from here? It seems like time has passed without anybody noticing. Mom, you didn't even know that someone had left me outside... the Pingalwara door when I was three days old. You embraced me like I was your own child. You don't realize what you did, but it's embedded in my heart. Now I'm older, I'm going to college. How do I make you understand all of this? How do I make you understand, Mother? Shall we play? Ruhani, my daughter... she's no longer your mother. Now, you're her mother... and she is your daughter. Do you understand? Good. Come, let's go. For so many incarnations I have been separated from you my Lord For so many incarnations I have been separated from you my Lord I dedicate this life to you I dedicate this life to you According to Ravidas I should place my hopes in you It's so long since I have gazed upon The Blessed Vision of Your Darshan It's so long since I have gazed upon The Blessed Vision of Your Darshan There's nobody as lonely as I am And nobody as compassionate as you There's nobody as lonely as I am And nobody as compassionate as you Why must we put ourselves to the test? May my mind surrender to your words Please bless your humble servant I'm a sacrifice A sacrifice to the Lord Oh, my Lord Why are you so silent? If someone were to ask me... who would've thought that when I started the Pingalwara... did I expect... God to be so kind... or that such good souls would join us. Bhagat Ji, please lie back down. Talking will increase your pain. Oh, no... Waheguru. You have my mother's temperament. Madam Inderjit Kaur is here to serve the Pingalwara. God choose you to serve. My precious baby cradled in my lap The moon is concealed in the clouds Everything for your pure love my baby I would give my heart my spirit My everything For your pure love my baby Your little arms around my neck Make me sway To the tune of love... Many years ago, Bhagat Puran Singh begged on the streets. He was insulted, disregarded, disrespected, and hungry. He planted a Pingalwara. Today, it has grown and has become a huge tree. Its shelter and branches have spread incredibly. Bhagat Ji said that, "The suffering of humanity has no caste, and no religion." The Pingalwara will never be associated with politics or business, but will forever be associated with the homeless and the crippled.
