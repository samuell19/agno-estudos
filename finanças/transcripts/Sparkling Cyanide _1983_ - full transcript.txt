WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE MOST SPLENDID LUNCH, ROSEMARY. WE MUST DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME. AH, BUT NOT WITHOUT MY HUSBAND PRESENT. I HAVE MY REPUTATION TO PROTECT. YOUR REPUTATION? WHAT ABOUT MY REPUTATION? NOW, I'M VERY LATE. I REALLY MUST GO. OH, GOOD-BYE. RIGHT. [HORN HONKS] HI! HELLO! HA HA! HELLO. OH, ROSEMARY. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. IRIS, YOU LOOK GREAT. I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GETTING HERE TILL TOMORROW. WHY DIDN'T YOU FLY? I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HOW WAS ENGLAND? SMALLER THAN AMERICA. ESPECIALLY AT 55 MILES AN HOUR IN A RENTED CAR. AFTER SIX MONTHS ABROAD, I THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE WHAT THE COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE. WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN ENGLAND? I'M A TRANSLATOR FOR THE FOREIGN SERVICE. WHO ARE YOU? OH. TRANSLATING AMERICAN INTO ENGLISH. I CAN SEE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A NEED FOR THAT. TONY BROWNE. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE LEAVING. I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN SUCH A RUSH. YOU MUST BE ROSEMARY'S SISTER. SHE'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU. EXCEPT, OF COURSE, HOW LOVELY YOU ARE. WELL, GO ON. GO ON. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER FOR AGES. PITY ME. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER AT ALL. BUT I SINCERELY HOPE I'M GONNA SEE HER AGAIN. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. OH, NO. THAT'S OK. WE'LL GET IT. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] THAT WAS WONDERFUL. MIND IF I BRING IN MORE COFFEE? COFFEE IN ENGLAND ALWAYS TASTED LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY EXPERIMENT. I'LL GET IT. I HAVE TO SEE ABOUT DESSERT, ANYWAY. IT'S GOOD TO SEE HER BACK TO HER OLD SELF AGAIN. SHE SEEMS FINE TO ME. WELL, A LITTLE PALE, MAYBE. NO, SHE'S BEEN DOWN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS. EVERY TIME SHE GETS DEPRESSED, SHE SPENDS MONEY. YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE BILLS. I'LL BET HE'S BEEN TELLING YOU I'M DEPRESSED. NOT TRUE. I HAVE ONE OF THOSE AWFUL VIRUSES THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE DEATH WARMED OVER, AND THAT'S ALL IT IS. BESIDES, THE MONEY'S MINE TO SPEND, SO WHY NOT? YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD ABOUT HAROLD. LAST TIME YOU WERE HOME, HE'S ALL YOU TALKED ABOUT. DON'T EVEN MENTION THE NAME TO ME. I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU WHAT HE PULLED. OOH, I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR. I'D TELL YOU, TOO, GEORGE, BUT YOU'D BE SHOCKED. YOU CAN HEAR IT LATER FROM ROSEMARY. BAKED ALASKA? HOW DID YOU GUESS? FOR 6,000 MILES, THAT'S ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT. IF IT'S WITH CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM, I'LL KILL MYSELF. BE MY GUEST. SO, TELL ME THE GOSSIP. HOW ARE THE NEWLYWEDS? I HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD FROM SANDRA SINCE... THE WEDDING AT CHRISTMAS TIME. OH, THEY'RE ALRIGHT, I GUESS. WE DON'T SEE THAT MUCH OF THEM, REALLY. THEY'LL BE AT OUR ANNIVERSARY PARTY SATURDAY NIGHT, OF COURSE. DO YOU LIKE STEPHAN ANY BETTER THAT YOU DID? AS I REMEMBER, YOU THOUGHT SANDRA WAS MUCH TOO GOOD FOR HIM. [LAUGHS] AH! I DON'T KNOW WHY I STILL HAVE THIS. CUTE, ISN'T HE? ENGLISHMAN. SOUNDS SO REFINED. BUT IT'S JUST A COVER FOR THE OLD DOUBLE-CROSS. YOU WANNA GUESS WHO I CAUGHT HIM WITH? SWEETIE, I AM DYING TO HEAR, BUT I'VE GOT TO GO. WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. IS THAT ALRIGHT? SURE. WHY NOT? YOU'RE MISSING A TALE OF LUST, RAGE, AND BETRAYAL. BUT I'M SURE IT WILL WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WE'LL HAVE TEA AND CINNAMON TOAST LIKE WE USED TO WHEN WE WERE KIDS. BYE-BYE. BYE. IRIS WAS JUST ASKING ABOUT YOU AND SANDRA. NAUGHTY ME. I SAID WE HARDLY EVER SEE YOU THESE DAYS. POUR ME SOME CHAMPAGNE, WILL YOU, STEPHAN? I THOUGHT WE COULD... CELEBRATE SIX LOVELY, ILLICIT MONTHS TOGETHER. I DON'T WANT TO CELEBRATE INFIDELITY. WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY? IT'S OVER. I WAS CRAZY TO GET INTO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT THIS LITTLE ATTACK OF CONSCIENCE? I DISCOVERED I'M IN LOVE... WITH MY WIFE. OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT. YOU MARRIED HER TO FURTHER YOUR POLITICAL CAREER. WHAT IF I DID? SHE'S BEAUTIFUL... WARM...AND LOYAL. I NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH SHE MEANT TO ME. UNTIL WHAT? UNTIL I UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT'D DO TO HER IF SHE FOUND OUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA DO, TAKE OUT AN AD IN THE TIMES? IF GEORGE FOUND OUT, HE'D KILL ME. HUH. HE'D KILL YOU, TOO. HEY! YOU'RE SERIOUS. I HAVEN'T ANY CHOICE. I JUST CAN'T GO ON WITH THIS. WAIT. DON'T DO THIS TO ME. THIS IS NOT A CASUAL FLING WITH ME. YOU KNOW THAT. I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WAY ABOUT ANYONE BEFORE. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU. I'M SORRY. I WISH IT WERE SOME OTHER WAY. I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE RISK. THE RISK? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THE RISK YOU'RE TAKING WITH ME. I HAVE LETTERS FROM YOU, AND I'LL GO STRAIGHT TO SANDRA. YOU'D REALLY DO THAT, WOULDN'T YOU? [CRYING] ROSEMARY, I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU COME IN. YOU CAUGHT ME. WHAT'S THE MATTER? NOTHING. I'LL BE ALRIGHT. YOU ARE DEPRESSED. WHAT'S WRONG? IRIS, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT ME, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM. OF COURSE I DO. HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT? YOU'RE THE ONLY FAMILY I'VE GOT AND I-- PROMISE ME ONE THING. WHATEVER HAPPENS... I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK BADLY OF ME. PROMISE? I COULDN'T THINK ANYTHING BAD ABOUT YOU. HEY. YOU'RE MY SISTER. YOU'VE BEEN EVERYTHING TO ME. WELL, I'VE GOT TO TAKE OFF. I'M LATE ALREADY. VICTOR SHOULD BE HERE SOON. WELL, GO AHEAD. I DON'T MIND. I'M A WORKAHOLIC LIKE YOU, SO I CAN GET CAUGHT UP FOR MONDAY. BESIDES, I LIKE HAVING YOU INDEBTED TO ME. RUTH, I COULDN'T RUN THIS PLACE WITHOUT YOU. I WOULDN'T HAVE A PRACTICE. TRULY. CALL ME AT KIDDERMINSTER'S ONCE THE PAPERS ARE SIGNED. SURE. [JAZZ PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] VIOLET, HI. ERIC. HELLO, ROSEMARY. WHERE'S GEORGE? I'VE SOME PEOPLE WANTIN' TO MEET HIM. HE'LL BE HERE SHORTLY. HE HAD TO GO TO THE OFFICE. HE SWORE IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG. HMM. YOU KNOW RON KAUFFMAN, DON'T YOU? HE RUNS CONSOLIDATED CHEMICALS. YES. HI. OH, I BELIEVE YOU LEFT OFF ONE OF THE ZEROS THERE, DIDN'T YOU? NO? [MUTTERS] AND I THINK GEORGE CAN TWIST A FEW MORE ARMS HERE AND RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS... HELLO, ROSEMARY. FOR STEPHAN'S CAMPAIGN. WELL, GEORGE CAN IF ANYBODY CAN. HE'S RUTHLESS UNDERNEATH THAT CIVILIZED EXTERIOR. MM-HMM. [ALL LAUGH] EXCUSE ME. HOW DELIGHTFUL. HELLO. WHAT A SURPRISE. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU. NOW, I DO HOPE YOU'RE NOT RICH. EVERYBODY I'VE MET SO FAR SEEMS TO BE ROLLING IN BUCKS. HMM... DISGUSTING. WELL, I'M NOT RICH. AND WHAT IF I WERE? THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MONEY. WELL, ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU. MONEY MAY NOT BUY HAPPINESS, BUT AT LEAST ONE CAN AFFORD A LOT OF PSYCHIATRIC HELP. GOOD POINT. LET ME GET YOU A DRINK. NOW, ROSEMARY'S HUSBAND IS THE COUNSEL TO MR. KIDDERMINSTER'S COMPANY, ISN'T HE? MM-HMM. SO YOU MUST KNOW THE FAMILY WELL. I WAS SANDRA'S MAID OF HONOR. WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR YEARS. AH. WELL, IN THAT CASE, YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HERE. HO HO! HARDLY. I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR ALMOST A YEAR. SPEAKING OF THAT, WHO DO YOU KNOW? HOW DID YOU GET INVITED TO THIS? DON'T YOU THINK MY INHERENT CHARM WOULD BE ENOUGH TO OPEN EVERY DOOR? NO. OH. WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M A JOURNALIST. MY NEWSPAPER IN LONDON SENT ME HERE TO DO A PIECE ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN BUSINESS ETHICS. AND BELIEVE ME, THERE'S QUITE A DIFFERENCE. THEY SET ME UP WITH AN INTRODUCTION TO MR. KIDDERMINSTER, AND HE WAS KIND TO INVITE ME TO THIS LITTLE AFFAIR. HOW INTERESTING. GRIPPING. TOO BAD I CAN'T HELP. OH, BUT YOU CAN. YOU CAN TELL ME WHO IS DOING WHAT TO WHOM. WELL--HA HA HA-- THERE WE HAVE ERIC AND VIOLET KIDDERMINSTER, THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE WHAT THEY WANT. STEPHAN, OF COURSE, WANTS POWER. I SUSPECT HE'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET IT. AND ROSEMARY... A BIT OF A MYSTERY, EVEN TO ME. SANDRA! IRIS, HI. EXCUSE ME. YOUR FATHER LOOKS LIKE HE'S GETTING A KICK OUTTA ALL THIS. HE CERTAINLY DOES. OH, TONY BROWNE, SANDRA FARRADAY. HELLO, TONY. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE. HE'S HAVING A BALL. HE LOVES AMERICAN POLITICS. DOWN AND DIRTY. DOWN AND DIRTY, MY FOOT. YOUR FATHER'S THE ONLY HONEST MAN I KNOW. EXCEPT MAYBE GEORGE. WELL, POLITICS BRINGS OUT THE KILLER INSTINCT. ALL THAT DELICIOUS INTRIGUE, AND SUCH HIGH STAKES. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT THE BUG, TOO. HOW'S MARRIAGE? THAT'S WHAT I WANNA HEAR ABOUT. FULL OF SURPRISES. OOH, GOODY. TELL ME EVERYTHING. WELL... DON'T HOLD BACK ON MY ACCOUNT. I THOUGHT MARRIAGE WAS DOWN AND DIRTY, TOO. EXCUSE ME. I'D LIKE TO STEAL HIM AWAY FOR JUST A MOMENT. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WAS SO CHARMING. OH, BUT THERE'S LOTS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME. MEANING WHAT? I HAVE A COUSIN NAMED VICTOR DRAKE. THE BLACK SHEEP OF THE FAMILY. I UNDERSTAND YOU TWO ARE OLD FRIENDS. I DON'T WANT THAT TALKED ABOUT. ARE YOU SURE YOUR NAME IS TONY BROWNE? I BET IRIS WOULD BE AMUSED TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU. KNOCK IT OFF, ROSEMARY. I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A MEAN STREAK, BUT I'VE GOT ONE, TOO. SO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. I DO AS I PLEASE. SORRY I'M LATE. I'M VICTOR DRAKE. GEORGE HERE? NO. HE HAD TO LEAVE. HE WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF. ARE YOU FURIOUS WITH ME? I HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME. THE FREEWAY WAS BACKED UP TO ROSEMEAD. TRUCK TURNED OVER. VEGETABLES ALL OVER THE ROAD. PEOPLE RUNNING OVER CARROTS AND TURNIPS... IT LOOKED LIKE A STEW. I SEE. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. EVEN WHEN I'M TELLING THE TRUTH, PEOPLE THINK I'M JUST MAKING THINGS UP. HANDSOME PLACE. GEORGE MUST BE DOING WELL FOR HIMSELF, HMM? AND YOU MUST BE... RUTH LESSING. I'M MR. BARTON'S SECRETARY. WHAT A WASTE. WHY DON'T WE GET THOSE PAPERS SIGNED? I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IRIS, DARLING! I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU. HOW WAS LONDON? DON'T YOU LOOK DELICIOUS! THANK YOU. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY BARGING IN. NOT AT ALL. WHAT A NICE SURPRISE, LUCILLA. THIS IS MY AUNT LUCILLA DRAKE, TONY BROWNE. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO? I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PERSUADE IRIS TO RUN AWAY WITH ME. PERHAPS YOU'D PUT A GOOD WORD ON MY BEHALF. RUN AWAY WITH THE MAN. HE'S AWFULLY CUTE. [CHUCKLES] I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ROSEMARY DIDN'T TELL YOU. GEORGE WANTED ME HERE NEXT WEEK FOR THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY, BUT VIOLET INSISTED I BE HERE TODAY. SO I SAID TO HECK WITH IT, THREW SOME THINGS IN A BAG, GRABBED A PLANE, AND HERE I AM. GLAD YOU COULD COME, SENATOR. HI. A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU DOWN HERE WITH US. STEPHAN. I MISS YOU, STEPHAN. YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW. OUT OF THE QUESTION. SORRY. I REALLY DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT. HOW COULD I NOT BE, AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH? I DO CARE. SANDRA WOULD BE UPSET IF SHE FOUND OUT, DON'T YOU THINK? IT'S A BIG MISTAKE TO THREATEN ME. A BIG MISTAKE. IN THE OLD DAYS, MEN LIKE ME WERE REFERRED TO AS CADS AND BOUNDERS. WHAT'S GEORGE TOLD YOU ABOUT ME SO FAR? THAT YOU'RE AN OLD-FASHIONED CROOK. OH, GEORGE IS VERY GENEROUS. TOO BAD GEORGE DIDN'T MARRY YOU. WHY NOT? YOU'RE RELIABLE, EFFICIENT, LOYAL. EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS. COUSIN ROSEMARY'S TOLD ME ABOUT YOU. I'M SURE IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. VERY DEFTLY PUT, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET ALL SNOOTY AND PROPER WITH ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I BET I KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE TALKS TO YOU. "HANDLE THIS. "HANDLE THAT. "HANDLE... VICTOR." HMM? LET'S GO HAVE A DRINK. SOMEPLACE ELEGANT. YOUR TREAT. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- IF YOU DON'T GO HAVE A DRINK WITH ME, I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL EVERYONE WE WENT OUT, ANYWAY. OK, IF IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF YOU. LET ME GIVE MR. BARTON A BUZZ. YES, I AM RIGHT. IF IT WEREN'T FOR ROSEMARY, GEORGE BARTON WOULD MARRY YOU. JUST LIKE THAT. I ALWAYS CARRY MY SUGAR SUBSTITUTE. I HOPE YOU DON'T USE REAL SUGAR. SPOIL THOSE LOVELY WHITE TEETH OF YOURS. OH, DON'T WORRY. THEY'RE NOT MINE. [LAUGHS] WHAT'S VICTOR UP TO THESE DAYS? NOTHING MUCH. JUST THE SAME AS USUAL, I GUESS. HE'S OFF TO ARGENTINA OR SOMEPLACE. THIS IS MY SON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. VICTOR DRAKE? YES, DO YOU KNOW HIM? NO, NO, NO. I JUST... HEARD THE NAME SOMEWHERE. THAT WAS ALL. GEORGE DOESN'T THINK I KNOW, BUT HE'S DRAWN UP AN AGREEMENT OF SOME SORT. SO MUCH MONEY IF VICTOR SWEARS TO GO OFF SOMEWHERE. GEORGE IS RIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT I FEEL SO GUILTY. VICTOR'S NOT BAD. HE JUST HAS NO COMMON SENSE. I KNOW, BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP PICKING UP THE TAB FOR HIS MISTAKES. WELL, HE'S A RATHER EXPENSIVE CHILD. OF COURSE, HE HAS SUCH A GOOD HEART. AND EXPENSIVE TASTES. TONY HERE DESPISES THE RICH. WELL, PEOPLE WITHOUT MONEY USUALLY DO. WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING? I'M A JOURNALIST. [CHUCKLES] OR SO HE SAYS. YOU'LL NOTICE HE DOESN'T CARRY A TAPE RECORDER OR EVEN A PAD OF PAPER AND PENCIL. OH, BUT I HAVE A WONDERFUL MEMORY. PROVE IT. THE EXACT QUOTE WAS, "RUN AWAY WITH THE MAN. HE'S AWFULLY CUTE." [LUCILLA LAUGHS] I DRANK TOO MUCH. I HOPE I DIDN'T MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF. I THOUGHT YOU WERE FINE. YOU'RE ALWAYS SO GRACIOUS, AREN'T YOU? HARDLY. NO, REALLY. SOMETIMES I THINK I'M A TERRIBLE WIFE, BUT YOU ALWAYS TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF ME. I KNOW I'M NOT EASY TO LIVE WITH. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU... FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I EVER SAW YOU. YOU'RE SO SWEET. I DON'T DESERVE YOU, BUT I DO LOVE YOU... IN MY OWN CONFUSED WAY. I ONLY HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. [SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] YOU DO LIKE CHAMPAGNE? MUCH TOO MUCH, I'M AFRAID. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] OH, MY. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MUSIC ENDS, SCATTERED APPLAUSE] EXCUSE ME. STEPHAN, WOULD YOU DANCE WITH ME? YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU? NO, OF COURSE NOT. EXCUSE ME. [MUSIC CONTINUES] I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, DARLING. ROSEMARY SEEMS SO NERVOUS TONIGHT. WELL, PERHAPS SHE'S PLANNING A BIG SURPRISE FOR GEORGE. IT'S MAKING HER A LITTLE TENSE. MAYBE THAT'S ALL IT IS. HOPE SO. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'VE GOT A STINKING HEADACHE COMING ON. I CAN FEEL MYSELF GETTING NASTY WITH PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ASPIRIN, DO YOU? YES. THANK YOU. HOW MANY KINDS OF MEDICATION DO YOU TAKE? MOSTLY PAINKILLERS, AS A MATTER OF FACT. THE ASPIRIN ARE THE WHITE ONES. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE ILL. I'M NOT. DIFFERENT KIND OF PAIN. AHH. WATCH MY PURSE FOR ME, WILL YOU, RUTH? [LAUGHTER] I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST TO ROSEMARY, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WIFE A MAN COULD HAVE... AND TO SIX YEARS OF MARRIAGE... THE HAPPIEST IN MY LIFE. TO ROSEMARY. ROSEMARY. Tony: TO ROSEMARY. Rosemary: THANK YOU. BEFORE I DO ANYTHING ELSE, I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST-- TO YOU, GEORGE. YOU'RE MUCH MORE THAN I DESERVE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING SO MANY THINGS POSSIBLE, INCLUDING TONIGHT. TO GEORGE. All: TO GEORGE. [GASPING] [GASPING FOR BREATH] SHE'S DEAD. ROSEMARY. [SIREN] WE'LL WANT STATEMENTS FROM ANY WAITERS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICE AT THE TABLE. HAD ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE CHAMPAGNE BEEN SERVED WHEN MRS. BARTON COLLAPSED? NO, CAPTAIN. THEY HAD NOT BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT VERY LONG. IN FACT, ONLY ONE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE HAD BEEN OPENED. ALRIGHT. THANK YOU. WELL, MY GUESS IS CYANIDE. SHE HAS LARGE AREAS OF CHERRY RED COLORING ON THE UPPER ARMS AND CHEST, AND WE'RE PICKING UP A STRONG SMELL OF BITTER ALMONDS NEAR HER MOUTH. THE EXTREME RAPIDITY OF DEATH WOULD ALSO INDICATE CYANIDE POISONING. GET THE LAB WORK DONE AND HAVE IT CONFIRMED. Man: CAPTAIN. CHECK THIS, TOO. HOW DID SHE INGEST IT? THE CHAMPAGNE? IT LOOKS THAT WAY TO ME. SHE COULD'VE TAKEN SOME KINDA PILLS, BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. ALL YOU'VE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT IF THE CYANIDE WAS SELF-ADMINISTERED OR GIVEN TO HER BY SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU HAVE A VERY KEEN GRASP OF THE OBVIOUS. I'M JUST HERE TO HELP OUT. HELLO, SANDRA, STEPHAN. I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS LATER, BUT FOR NOW, I THINK YOU CAN BOTH GO HOME. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. I'LL COME THE HOUSE TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE, BUT FRANKLY, I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. WELL, WE'LL SEE. SAY HELLO TO YOUR FATHER FOR ME. I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I'VE CLOSED THE OFFICE. I'VE CANCELED ALL YOUR APPOINTMENTS FOR THE FEW DAYS, BUT THAT HEARING ON FRIDAY IS UNAVOIDABLE. THAT'S ALRIGHT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'LL HAVE TO BE BACK IN THE OFFICE BY THEN. WHAT ABOUT VICTOR? YOU SAID YOU WANTED HIM TO SIGN THAT CLAIM ON LUCILLA'S HOUSE. SO THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO UNTIL HE'S DONE THAT. I'VE MADE A RESERVATION FOR HIM ON A PLANE TO BUENOS AIRES AFTER THIS. YOU MADE THE RESERVATION? I DIDN'T THINK WE COULD TRUST HIM TO DO IT HIMSELF. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE'D HAVE TAKEN THE MONEY AND GAMBLED IT AWAY. THANKS. SURE. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE DELAY, CAPTAIN. AMAZING, THE THINGS THAT SUDDENLY HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH. YES, I CAN IMAGINE. WE GOT THE GROSS RESULTS ON THE AUTOPSY, MR. BARTON. IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR WIFE DIED OF, UH, CYANIDE POISONING. CYANIDE? WHAT--YOU MEAN SHE KILLED HERSELF? THERE'S ALWAYS THAT POSSIBILITY. WE HAVEN'T RULED OUT HOMICIDE IN THIS CASE, EITHER. I'M HOPING YOU MIGHT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S MENTAL STATE PRIOR TO LAST NIGHT'S PARTY. OH. I-- I'M SORRY. I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE TAKING ALL THIS IN. I... I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA TELL ME THAT SHE'D DIED OF AN ANEURYSM. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IRIS TELLS ME THAT ROSEMARY HAD BEEN DEPRESSED. I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT SHE'D BEEN A LITTLE DOWN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, BUT THE NOTION THAT SHE'D KILL HERSELF... IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. AND YET... THAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU MENTIONED JUST NOW. I DON'T SEE HOW SHE COULD HAVE BEEN MURDERED. THAT'S EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE. HOW SO? I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MR. BARTON, THAT FROM OUR REPORTS, SHE WAS NOT UNIVERSALLY LOVED. OF COURSE NOT. NOW, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, ROSEMARY WAS...COMPLEX. AS FOND OF HER AS I WAS, SHE HAD A SHREWISH TONGUE AT TIMES. SHE COULD BE CRUEL WHEN HER MOOD WAS OFF-- BUT SHE COULD BE GENEROUS AND APPEALING, THOUGHTFUL... AND HOSPITABLE. WHAT ABOUT HER FINANCIAL AFFAIRS? WE'VE BEEN TOLD THERE WAS A SIZABLE INHERITANCE. THERE'S NO SECRET IN THAT. SHE HAD A LARGE TRUST FUND SET UP FOR HER BY LUCILLA'S EX-HUSBAND, PAUL BENNETT. PAUL AND I HAD NO CHILDREN OF OUR OWN. HE BECAME VERY ATTACHED TO MY NIECES. HE LEFT NOTHING TO YOU. YEAH, A TOKEN AMOUNT. BUT I HAD REMARRIED BY THEN, MR. DRAKE, AND I WAS VERY WELL OFF. VICTOR HAD BEEN BORN. APPARENTLY PAUL FELT IT MADE MORE SENSE TO LEAVE HIS MONEY TO ROSEMARY. BUT NOT TO IRIS. WELL, THAT'S THE WAY THE TRUST WAS SET UP. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY. BUT ON ROSEMARY'S DEATH, IRIS INHERITED EVERYTHING. I'M SORRY. I REALLY AM SORRY. DIDN'T WE HAVE A CASE LIKE THIS WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER DURING THE WAR? YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK THIS ONE IS A SUICIDE. WELL, I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE WHO WOULD KILL THEMSELVES JUST HOPING SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD GET BLAMED. I'M SURPRISED SOMEONE HASN'T DISPOSED OF HER BEFORE NOW. YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T? I KNEW ROSEMARY BARTON. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS, DARLING. IT'S TOO UPSETTING FOR YOU. RUTH AND I CAN HANDLE IT SOME OTHER TIME. IT'S WORSE TO SEE HER THINGS EVERYWHERE. ANYWAY, I DON'T MIND. IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN CAN DO TO HELP BEFORE I GO? WE'RE FINE. THANKS, ANYWAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TROOPING IN AND OUT. IT'S ALMOST OBSCENE. WHAT'S GEORGE DECIDED ABOUT THE FUNERAL? WELL, THE BODY WON'T BE RELEASED UNTIL TOMORROW. SO I'LL BE TALKING TO THE FUNERAL HOME IN THE MORNING. I'LL LET YOU KNOW AFTER THAT. YOU'VE BEEN SUPER. THANKS. I'LL BE BY TOMORROW AS SOON AS I CAN. ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PSYCHIC TO DETERMINE THAT SHE'S BEEN IN LOVE WITH GEORGE BARTON FOR YEARS. POOR WOMAN. LUCILLA, THAT'S TERRIBLE! I'M SORRY. OF COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT. ROSEMARY ISN'T EVEN BURIED. OH, LET'S DO THE REST OF THIS IN THE MORNING. GEORGE HAS TO GO TO BED IN HERE SOMETIME TONIGHT. YOU GO ON, AUNT LUCILLA. I WANT TO DO A THING OR TWO MORE. ALRIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, DARLING. GOOD NIGHT. RUTH, LET ME WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR. YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE TAKING ON FAR TOO MUCH. I THOUGHT YOU MEANT TO TAKE ME TO A BAR. OH. WELL, IN THAT CASE, I HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. GUESS WHAT'S IN HERE. IT'S FROM PIERRE'S. MM-HMM. MMM. HE HAS GOOD PATES. SHH. LET'S NOT UPSET THE DUCKS. ANYWAY, YOU'RE WRONG. OH! ISN'T THAT A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN SOME BORING... PATE. PATE. AND... I HEARD YOU LOVE CHARDONNAY WITH THESE DISGUSTING LITTLE ORANGE CRISPY THINGS. THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP? I'M ALRIGHT. THE FUNERAL YESTERDAY WAS A BIT ROUGH. BUT I GUESS WE'LL GET THROUGH IT IN ONE PIECE. DID YOU KNOW ROSEMARY WELL? NO, NO, NO. I, UH...I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS. I GOT THE IMPRESSION SHE KNEW YOU FROM SOMEPLACE. WHAT PAPER ARE YOU WORKING FOR IN ENGLAND? TIMES. LONDON TIMES. I USED TO READ THAT EVERY DAY WHEN I WAS IN LONDON. OH. I NEVER NOTICED A TONY BROWNE BY-LINE. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I'VE EVER MET WHO READS BY-LINES. BIG PAPER. MY ARTICLES NORMALLY GET PUSHED TO THE BACK, ANYWAY. I USED TO READ THE WHOLE THING, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. I DON'T. AND I'M SURE I'D HAVE SEEN AT LEAST... ONE OF YOUR ARTICLES. IRIS... I AM A JOURNALIST. REALLY, I AM. GOD, YOU ENGLISHMEN WITH YOUR PLUMMY VOICES. IT'S JUST THE WAY HAROLD TALKED. I WANT TO TRUST YOU... BUT YOU'RE SO EVASIVE. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN. IRIS, BELIEVE ME, WHATEVER HAPPENS, I'M ON YOUR SIDE. IF YOU NEED ME, I'M HERE FOR YOU. BECAUSE MY MONEY GOES TO YOU ANYWAY, I HOPE IT BRINGS YOU THE HAPPINESS I FOUND SO ELUSIVE. IN ANY CASE, I'D LIKE CERTAIN OF MY THINGS TO BE DISPOSED OF SEPARATELY. TO STEPHAN FARRADAY, THE DISRAELI FIRST EDITIONS, WHICH SHOULD BE AN INSPIRATION TO ANY POLITICIAN. TO SANDRA, THE MARY CASATT OIL SHE SO ADMIRES, A NICE CONSOLATION PRIZE. DATED THURSDAY. THAT'S THE NIGHT I FOUND HER IN THE STUDY IN TEARS. THE CONSOLATION PRIZE TO SANDRA FARRADAY, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT ROSEMARY THOUGHT SANDRA MARRIED BENEATH HER. THAT'S THE ONLY THING I KNOW OF. WELL, THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS IN. IT LOOKS LIKE SHE MAY HAVE INTENDED SUICIDE AFTER ALL. YES, I SUPPOSE IT DOES. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE, BUT IT DOES LOOK THAT WAY. WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER GET BACK TO THE HOUSE. GOOD-BYE. YOU THINK IT'S A FAKE? VERY CONVENIENT, HER FINDING WHAT AMOUNTS TO A SUICIDE NOTE. [SCATTERED APPLAUSE] AH, JIM, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY SON-IN-LAW'S SPEECH? I'M AFRAID I MISSED THAT. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO RUN DOWN THE SOURCE OF THE CYANIDE THAT KILLED MRS. BARTON. YOU USE POTASSIUM CYANIDE IN YOUR ELECTRONICS PLANT, DON'T YOU? MM-HMM. YOU MIND IF I WENT TO THE PLANT WITH YOU TO HAVE A LOOK? WHAT'S GOING ON? DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT FOR THIS? MR. FARRADAY, THIS IS ALL AN INFORMAL PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON OUR PART. NOBODY'S BEING ACCUSED OF ANYTHING. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CRIME IS AT THIS POINT. OF COURSE, JIM, YOU'RE WELCOME TO CHECK ANYTHING YOU LIKE. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT POTASSIUM CYANIDE IS AVAILABLE FROM ANY DOCTOR'S OFFICE, COMMERCIAL SUPPLY HOUSES... YES, WE'RE AWARE OF THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO START SOMEPLACE. HMM. WELL, EXCUSE US. SURELY. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. GIVE ME A CALL. OK. AND THANKS FOR COMING. SURE. TERRIFIC. ALRIGHT, EH? THANK YOU. I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME, SWEETHEART. WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM TOGETHER. I WISH THE POLICE WOULD MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. WHAT'S THE IMPLICATION, THAT FATHER GOT THE CYANIDE, OR YOU, PERHAPS? ME? WHY WOULD I DO THAT? SURELY YOU'D KNOW BETTER THAN I. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? BESIDES, YOU WERE THE ONE THAT SAID YOU GAVE SOMETHING TO ROSEMARY FOR A HEADACHE. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL KEMP? ALL I'VE GOTTA TELL HIM IS THAT IT WAS ASPIRIN. THAT'S ALL IT WAS. ANYWAY, KEMP SAID IT WAS SOMETHING IN HER CHAMPAGNE, AND I WASN'T EVEN SITTING CLOSE TO HER. SANDRA... LET'S NOT FIGHT, SHALL WE? I WANT TO TALK, TO EXPLAIN SOME THINGS. SAVE YOUR SPEECHES FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN. I DON'T WANT ANY EXPLANATIONS FROM YOU. WHOA. THIS THING WASN'T CHEAP. YOU'LL HAVE TO THANK GEORGE FOR ME, OR WILL HE BE IN? TOMORROW. I'LL TELL HIM YOU SAID FAREWELL. GOOD-BYE, VICTOR. YOUR PLANE LEAVES AT 9:00. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AT 11:00. WE'VE GOT TIME TO GET A DRINK BEFORE YOU DRIVE ME TO THE AIRPORT. NOW, WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT? YOU'VE GOT MONEY. TAKE A CAB. OH, DEAR. SOMETHING'S PUT YOU IN A BAD MOOD. NOW, LISTEN. YOU GOT NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. YOU GOT IT MADE. WITH COUSIN ROSEMARY GONE TO THE ANGELS... YOU'VE GOT A CLEAR SHOT AT HIM. YOU'VE GOT A NASTY MIND. RUTHIE, I'M JUST GOOD AT RECOGNIZING AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT COMES ALONG. NOW, WHAT'S THAT MAKE ME GUILTY OF, HMM? NOW, COME ON. GIVE ME A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME A RIDE, HOW WILL YOU KNOW IF I REALLY GOT ON THE PLANE? YOU'RE AWFUL. I KNOW, BUT I'M CUTE. THERE'S, UH, STILL ANOTHER PLANE AT MIDNIGHT. [EXASPERATED SIGH] MR. BARTON, FOR THE TIME BEING, WE'RE GONNA BE LISTING THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THIS CASE AS "UNKNOWN." THEN YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS SUICIDE? WELL, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. WE DON'T THINK IT WAS ACCIDENTAL. AND FOR THE MOMENT, WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO LIST IT AS EITHER A SUICIDE OR A HOMICIDE. YOU MEAN THE CASE IS CLOSED? FAR FROM IT. WE DON'T CLOSE A CASE UNTIL IT'S SOLVED. IF THIS IS A HOMICIDE, WE'LL PURSUE IT. BUT YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED YOUR CURRENT LEADS? FOR NOW, YES, BUT SOMETHING COULD DEVELOP. I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT. WHAT IF I WERE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION ON MY OWN? I WOULD URGE YOU TO DO SO WITH CAUTION. AND, OF COURSE, TO LET US KNOW IF YOU DISCOVER ANYTHING. OF COURSE. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? THIS CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY. WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW THIS TO CAPTAIN KEMP? BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SET A TRAP. WHY BRING THIS TO ME? CALL IT A SAFETY PLAY. I WANT SOMEBODY BESIDES IRIS TO KNOW WHAT I'M UP TO. TAKE MY ADVICE, GEORGE. LEAVE IT TO THE POLICE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO INVESTIGATE A MURDER. NO BACKGROUND, NO EQUIPMENT, NO EXPERIENCE. BUT I HAVE MONEY AND I HAVE TIME. AND THE POLICE DON'T. YOU'RE AN AMATEUR. SO IS THE KILLER. IT WAS SOMEBODY AT THE TABLE THAT NIGHT. IN WHICH CASE, I'M THE LAST PERSON YOU SHOULD CONFIDE IN. MY DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW WERE THERE. YOU ARE A MAN OF HONOR. AND YOU HAVE A CONSCIENCE. RUBBISH. I'M VERY PROTECTIVE OF MY FAMILY. IF ROSEMARY HAD THREATENED ME OR MINE, WELL, I DON'T SAY I'D HAVE KILLED HER, BUT SHE'D HAVE FELT MY WRATH. I'M NOT ASKING FOR A LOYALTY OATH, ERIC. I HAVE TO TRUST SOMEONE. IT'S IRIS' BIRTHDAY A WEEK OFF. I'M HAVING A PARTY WITH SAME PEOPLE AT THE SAME PLACE. THAT SOUNDS FOOLISH TO ME. IT MAY BE, BUT IT'S THE ONLY THING I'VE COME UP WITH SO FAR. AND I'M GOING TO FOLLOW IT THROUGH. I STRONGLY DISAPPROVE. AND I MUST TELL YOU THIS. WHEN IT FIRST BEGAN TO BE WHISPERED ABOUT THAT SOMEONE HAD MURDERED ROSEMARY, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU WERE THE OBVIOUS SUSPECT. OF COURSE I AM. IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON TO FIND OUT. WHAT CAN YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH? ANYONE COOL ENOUGH TO PUT CYANIDE INTO ROSEMARY'S DRINK IS HARDLY GOING TO BREAK DOWN AND BURST INTO TEARS JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. I DO HAVE MORE THAN THAT. SUCH AS WHAT? I THINK I'D BETTER KEEP THAT TO MYSELF. [CHUCKLES] SO NICE TO BE SOMEONE YOU TRUST, GEORGE. SURPRISE IS A KEY ELEMENT. I JUST HOPE YOU AREN'T THE ONE SURPRISED. ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THIS? I MEAN, DOES CAPTAIN KEMP KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? NO. I WAS AFRAID HE'D PUT HIS FOOT DOWN. PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA, ANYWAY. ERIC KIDDERMINSTER AND IRIS'VE BOTH GIVEN ME A HARD TIME. WELL, I TEND I AGREE. LAST WEEK YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. I WAS JUST SPEAKING HYPOTHETICALLY. BUT YOU WERE SO RIGHT. AND I WANT YOU TO BE THERE. I'LL NEED AN EXTRA PAIR OF EYES. AND I COULD USE A LITTLE MORAL SUPPORT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. WELL, OF COURSE I'LL BE THERE, IF YOU WANT ME. I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY. WHERE MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE'S CONCERNED, YOU'RE IRREPLACEABLE. IN BUSINESS? OF COURSE. STEPHAN, LOOK AT THIS. IT'S FROM GEORGE BARTON-- AN INVITATION TO A PARTY. IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE BIT TACKY OF HIM. TACKY? IT'S REVOLTING, THAT'S WHAT IT IS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WE'LL TELL HIM WE'VE MADE OTHER PLANS. WONDERFUL. THEN IT WILL LOOK LIKE WE FEEL TOO GUILTY TO ATTEND. OH, BY THE WAY, I NEARLY FORGOT. I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY. OH, TONY, DON'T DISAPPOINT ME. I REALLY WANT YOU TO BE THERE. FRIDAY NIGHT'S THE ONLY NIGHT THIS FELLOW WILL SEE ME, I MUST GET THIS ARTICLE WRITTEN. TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER ON SATURDAY. JUST THE TWO OF US. IT'LL BE MUCH MORE FUN. TONY. GEORGE THINKS SOMEONE MURDERED ROSEMARY. HE'S SETTING UP THIS PARTY TO RECREATE THE CIRCUMSTANCE. IF YOU DON'T SHOW, IT'LL-- I'M A MURDER SUSPECT? OF COURSE YOU ARE. SO AM I. IN FACT, I'M PROBABLY THE BIGGEST. YOU'RE NOT SO BIG. ANYWAY, I'M MORE OF A SUSPECT THAN YOU ARE. I'M A FOREIGNER. PEOPLE MIGHT SUSPECT ME OF ANYTHING SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M A STRANGER HERE. YOU'RE STRANGE, THAT'S FOR SURE. AM I? KISS ME ANYWAY. PLEASE COME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY FRIDAY NIGHT. PERSUADE ME. I SIMPLY WANTED TO CONFIRM, MISS WEST, THAT EVERYTHING'S SET FOR TOMORROW NIGHT. [KNOCK ON DOOR] GOOD. THANKS. THAT WAS VICTOR AGAIN ON THE PHONE. HE'S IN ARUBA. ARUBA? WHAT'S HE DOING THERE? HE LOST HIS MONEY IN A CASINO, THEN HE SIGNED SOME I.O.U.s. HE'S AFRAID FOR HIS LIFE IF WE DON'T COME UP WITH THE FUNDS. HOW MUCH? $3,500. CABLE THE MONEY. BUT DON'T ACCEPT HIS CALLS FROM NOW ON.

HEAR, HEAR. MAY SHE HAVE MANY MORE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. SHALL WE RISK IT? CERTAINLY. MAY I? YOU'VE DANCED WITH GEORGE ALL EVENING. SURE. YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME. OH, YOU TWO GO AND DANCE. I'M GOING TO POWDER MY NOSE. THIS ALL SEEMS VERY UNEVENTFUL SO FAR. SOMEHOW, I GOT THE IMPRESSION SOMEONE WAS SUPPOSED TO CRACK UNDER FIRE. OH. IS IT THAT OBVIOUS WHAT I'M UP TO? YOU'RE ENTITLED TO TRY. YOU KNOW, IT IS POSSIBLE SHE KILLED HERSELF. MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO FACE THAT. WHY WOULD SHE KILL HERSELF? POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL. MAYBE THERE WAS ONE THING SHE WANTED THAT SHE COULDN'T HAVE. CAN YOU STILL FEEL YOUR TOES? THANK YOU. I SUPPOSE THERE'S ONE MORE TOAST THAT WE SHOULD MAKE. TO ROSEMARY. ROSEMARY. [GASPING AND CHOKING] POOR GEORGE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GONE. HE WAS A WONDERFUL MAN. I SHALL MISS HIM SORELY. I'M GOING UP TO BED. MY HEAD IS KILLING ME. ROSEMARY AND GEORGE BOTH DEAD IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS. IT'S A NIGHTMARE. I COULD USE A DRINK. IRIS, SIT DOWN. I'LL GET IT. I'M SO WIRED. I CAN'T EVEN CRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS, UH...ROTTEN... BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS TO YOU. WELL, WHAT IS IT? THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG BEFORE YOU CAME HERE. NOW 2 PEOPLE ARE DEAD. IRIS, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT. WHY SHOULD I? I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO BE SEXY AND MYSTERIOUS. NOW I...I'M AFRAID TO DRINK THE BOURBON YOU JUST POURED FOR ME. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE I'M A KILLER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE! YOU SAY YOU'RE ON MY SIDE. YOU SAY I CAN TRUST YOU, BUT HOW CAN I WHEN I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TELLING ME THE TRUTH? ALRIGHT. I SHOULD'E LEVELED WITH YOU A LONG TIME AGO. I'M NOT A JOURNALIST. I'M A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO IN THE FIRST PLACE? HOW? I'M WORKING ON A CASE. I CAN'T GO AROUND TELLING EVERYBODY WHO I REALLY AM. BESIDES, I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GONNA FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU. I REALLY AM VERY, VERY SORRY ABOUT GEORGE. I KNOW. SO AM I. CLOSE IT. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. I SAW IT. YOU CAN'T RUN FOR STATE ASSEMBLY WITH A MURDER CHARGE HANGING OVER YOU. I HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING. I'VE ALREADY RECEIVED 4 PHONE CALLS. PEOPLE ARE WITHDRAWING THEIR SUPPORT. YOUR CAREER WILL SINK BEFORE IT'S EVEN LAUNCHED. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THAT PARTY LAST NIGHT. SANDRA INSISTED. DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ROSEMARY BARTON? WHAT RELATIONSHIP? DON'T MINCE WORDS WITH ME. I'M TRYING TO SALVAGE YOUR POLITICAL CAREER, WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN RUINS. DON'T PUSSYFOOT AROUND. PLAY IT STRAIGHT FOR ONCE! I DON'T KNOW WHAT SANDRA KNOWS. I ADMIT I HAD AN AFFAIR, BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME A MURDER. WHAT KINDA MAN DO YOU THINK I AM? I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU ARE, STEPHAN. YOU'RE BRILLIANT AND AGGRESSIVE, WHICH IS WHY I MADE YOU A VICE PRESIDENT AT THE RIDICULOUS AGE OF 29. I'VE WATCHED A LONG TIME, I THINK YOU'D BE A WINNING CANDIDATE FOR ANY OFFICE YOU CHOOSE-- AS LONG AS YOU ARE TELLING ME THE TRUTH. IF YOU'RE LYING, I'LL THROW YOU TO THE WOLVES. HELLO, TONY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SAME AS YOU, I WOULD IMAGINE. I WANTED TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS A LITTLE LESS CHANTIGNON LAST NIGHT. HOW'D YOU FIND OUT ABOUT MISS SHANNON? THE ELVES AND THE FAIRIES TOLD ME. HOW ABOUT YOU? WE GOT 'EM WORKIN' FOR US, TOO. THEY CHECKED YOU OUT WITH INTERPOL. APPARENTLY, YOU'RE ONE OF US. WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL POOL OUR RESOURCES. AFTER YOU. YOU GUYS MUST BE BUSY IF YOU'RE TALKING TO EVERYBODY THAT WAS THERE LAST NIGHT. THE PLACE WAS PACKED. SUGAR? IT RUINS THE TEETH. I'D LIKE HONEY, IF YOU HAVE IT. YOUR TABLE WAS CLOSE TO THE BARTONS'. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU SAW? SEEMED TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME. ATTRACTIVE BUNCH. I THOUGHT I HAD FIGURED OUT WHO WAS WITH WHOM. THEN THEY ALL GOT UP TO DANCE AND THEY SEEMED TO SWITCH. YOU WERE WITH THAT BUNCH, AS A MATTER OF FACT. NO ONE STAYED AT THE TABLE DURING THAT TIME? SURE. THE OLDER WOMAN DID. BUT SHE WASN'T SITTING NEAR THE GUY THAT DROPPED DEAD. I THINK SHE WENT TO THE LADIES ROOM AT SOME POINT DURING THE EVENING. BUT I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ELSE. DID YOU SEE THE CHAMPAGNE GLASSES REFILLED? NOT WHILE THEY WERE ON THE DANCE FLOOR. I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING IF THEY WERE GONNA BRING A CAKE TO THE TABLE, SO I WAS LOOKING OVER THERE. UH, FORGIVE ME FOR SOUNDING IMPERTINENT, BUT... WHAT IS THAT? IT'S A WEEPING WILLOW. OH, I SEE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GIANT SQUID. OH! I JUST TOOK UP PAINTING LAST WEEK. I DON'T MEAN TO BUTT IN, BUT COULD WE GET BACK TO THE SUBJECT? YES, I'M SORRY. DID YOU SEE ANYONE GO NEAR THAT TABLE? JUST THE BUS BOY. HE WORKED OUR TABLE, TOO. WHEN SHE GOT UP, HER PURSE FELL ON THE FLOOR. HE PICKED IT AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE. HE COULD HAVE TAMPERED WITH THE GLASSES THEN. NO. PICKED THE PURSE UP, HE PUT IT BACK ON THE TABLE. THEN I SAW HIM WALK AWAY. NOBODY TOUCHED THOSE GLASSES. THAT MUCH I GUARANTEE. WHAT ABOUT THE MAN YOU WERE WITH? COULD HE VERIFY SOME OF THIS? HE PICKED ME UP AT A CAR WASH. I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT IT. I WAS NOT GONNA PASS UP DINNER AT LA CHANTIGNON. WHAT WAS HIS NAME? PEDRO DOMINGUEZ. I THINK HE'S STAYING AT THE HOTEL DOWN THE STREET. HE ASKED ME BACK TO HIS ROOM, BUT I DECLINED. BLEW A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH SMOKE FOR ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAW. WELL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? I DON'T KNOW. IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. GEORGE PROPOSES A TOAST TO IRIS. EVERYBODY DRINKS. 6 OF US GET UP TO DANCE. LUCILLA GOES TO THE LADIES' ROOM AND COMES BACK. DURING THAT TIME, THE CHAMPAGNE GLASSES WERE IN FULL VIEW, AND EVERYBODY SWEARS THEY WERE NOT TAMPERED WITH. YET THE MINUTE WE SIT DOWN AGAIN, GEORGE PROPOSES A TOAST, TAKES A DRINK OF CHAMPAGNE, AND DROPS DEAD. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER IS SURE THE CYANIDE WAS IN THE CHAMPAGNE. YES, BUT HOW'D IT GET THERE? AND WHEN? BEATS ME. WE GOT TO BE MISSING SOMETHING SOMEWHERE. WHEN'S THE FUNERAL? TOMORROW AFTERNOON. OH. 2 FUNERALS IN LESS THAN A MONTH. IT'S HORRIBLE. I HOPE YOU DON'T INTEND PLAYING AMATEUR DETECTIVE YOURSELF. I'D BE AFRAID TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. BELIEVE ME, I DON'T INTEND TO PURSUE IT THE WAY GEORGE DID. BUT YOU DID SPEAK TO STEPHAN? YES. I FORCED HIM TO ADMIT THE AFFAIR WITH ROSEMARY. WHETHER HE KILLED HER OR NOT, I COULDN'T SAY. THANK YOU. WHAT ABOUT SANDRA? HUH? WELL, IF SHE'D FOUND OUT, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE DONE. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ROSEMARY'S DEATH. OH, ERIC... SHE'S VERY LIKE YOU. I LOVE THE CHILD DEARLY, BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SHE IS ABSOLUTELY RUTHLESS. SHE'S EVERY BIT AS AMBITIOUS AS STEPHAN. OUR DAUGHTER IS NOT A COLD-BLOODED KILLER. 2 PEOPLE HAVE DIED. WE CAN'T JUST LOOK THE OTHER WAY, NO MATTER WHO SHE IS OR HOW WE FEEL. BUT SHE'S ALL WE HAVE. THEN IF SHE'S GUILTY, ERIC, WE HAD BETTER KNOW ABOUT IT AND FIND A WAY TO KEEP HER FROM GETTING CAUGHT. LET'S JUST RUN IT BY ONE MORE TIME, SEE IF WE HAVE IT STRAIGHT. YOU'VE BEEN WORKING AS A BUS BOY AT LA CHANTIGNON FOR HOW LONG? 2 MONTHS. HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO SERVE THE BARTON TABLE THAT NIGHT? I ALWAYS HAVE STATION 8. STATION 9 AND 10, TOO. SO YOU WALK PAST THE TABLE AND YOU NOTICE THIS HANDBAG ON THE FLOOR, AND YOU PICK IT UP. YES. YES, SIR. DID SEE WHAT WAS IN THE PURSE? MAYBE YOU WERE CURIOUS. NO. NO, SIR. I PICKED THE BAG UP, PUT IT RIGHT BACK ON THE TABLE. I DIDN'T LOOK IN IT. I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING. AND NEITHER DID ANYONE ELSE. [KNOCK KNOCK] AH... THERE YOU ARE. LUCILLA THOUGHT YOU'D BE UP HERE. SHE SENT A CUP OF TEA. THANK YOU. EVERYBODY'S FINALLY GONE. THANKS. I JUST COULDN'T FACE ANY MORE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS. MMM. THE FUNERAL'S HARD ENOUGH WITHOUT EVERYBODY COMING BACK TO THE HOUSE. LOOK... THIS MIGHT SOUND, UH, PARANOID, BUT DO ME A FAVOR. FROM NOW ON, I DON'T WANT YOU GOING OUT ON YOUR OWN. DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR. DON'T OPEN THE MAIL. OH, COME ON. NO, LOOK, I'M SERIOUS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OR WHO MAY BE NEXT. YOU LOOK TIRED. I'M EXHAUSTED. IRIS... THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE MOMENT TO BRING IT UP... BUT YOU DID KNOW THAT ROSEMARY WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH STEPHAN FARRADAY. SHE WASN'T. I'M AFRAID SHE WAS. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. SANDRA'S MY BEST FRIEND. ROSEMARY DIDN'T EVEN LIKE STEPHAN. SHE TOLD ME SO HERSELF. I TRIED TO GET CLOSE TO YOUR SISTER WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED. MY, MY. YOU REALLY GOT AROUND, DIDN'T YOU? ALRIGHT, I DESERVED THAT. SHE HAD A BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK ONE NIGHT. WHICH IS WHEN SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE AFFAIR WITH STEPHAN. SO WHAT? SHE WAS A BIG GIRL. HE MAY HAVE KILLED HER. WHAT IF ROSEMARY THREATENED TO EXPOSE HIM, OR SANDRA FOUND OUT ABOUT IT? I DON'T WANNA TALK. WE HAVE TO. UNTIL WE KNOW WHY GEORGE AND ROSEMARY DIED, WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN THAT YOU'RE NOT IN DANGER YOURSELF. NOW, I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME-- [TELEPHONE RINGS] BARTON RESIDENCE. IT'S FOR LUCILLA. IT'S LONG DISTANCE, COLLECT. OH, NO. VICTOR AGAIN? [HORN HONKS] OH, HELL. WHO'S THIS? YES, YES, WE'LL ACCEPT. IRIS! JUST A MINUTE. IRIS, WAIT! [DOORBELL RINGS] YES? OH, MY GOD! I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. REALLY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE ANYONE. I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD RETURN THE DRESS AND ACCESSORIES. WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME... UH, THIS IS CHLOE WEST. IT SEEMS SHE'S AN ACTRESS THAT GEORGE HIRED FOR IRIS' BIRTHDAY PARTY. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SHOCKER. APPARENTLY, GEORGE THOUGHT IF SHE WALKED IN, SOMEONE MIGHT REACT. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW UP THAT NIGHT? SOME MAN CALLED AND TOLD ME NOT TO COME. WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS MR. BARTON. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, ANYWAY. FOR ALL I KNEW, IT COULD'VE BEEN A GAG FROM START. DIDN'T YOU READ ABOUT ROSEMARY'S DEATH IN THE PAPERS? SURE, I READ ABOUT IT, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HER. THEN I READ ABOUT MR. BARTON. AND THAT'S WHY I CAME. I'M GOING TO CALL CAPTAIN KEMP. YOU'RE SURE IT WAS A MAN WHO TOLD YOU NOT TO COME? MY JUDGMENT MAY NOT BE VERY GOOD, BUT MY HEARING IS JUST FINE. IT WAS A MAN. I'D SWEAR TO THAT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. CHILLY? OH, I'M ALRIGHT. JUST NEEDED SOME FRESH AIR. I REALLY CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS. I'M SO CONFUSED. IT JUST NEVER SEEMS TO END. TONY, YOU KNOW WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO DO? I'D LIKE TO TAKE OFF, JUST GET AWAY FOR A DAY. HOW ABOUT TOMORROW? PERFECT. DON'T DRINK THAT! KENDAL JUST TOLD ME HE SUGARED THE TEA. IT'S SO BAD FOR YOU, DARLING. FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THAT SOMEONE HAD POISONED THE TEA. OH, I'M SORRY. POISONED? OH, DARLING. WELL, I'M SURE I WOULDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT THAT. DIDN'T MR. BARTON ONCE TELL ME THAT YOU HAD BEEN MARRIED TO A CHEMIST? PAUL MADE HIS MONEY IN PHARMACEUTICALS-- PAUL BENNETT, MY FIRST HUSBAND. PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT. SURELY YOU MUST'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT DRUGS FROM THAT. NOT AT ALL. YOU CAN BE MARRIED TO AN AUTO MECHANIC AND NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT FIXING A CAR. DON'T YOU THINK? YOU CAN'T KEEP PRETENDING I DON'T EXIST! I NEED YOU. I'VE MISSED YOU. AND ROSEMARY? ROSEMARY MEANT NOTHING TO ME! I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT CAUGHT UP BUT IT WAS WRONG! I KNOW THAT! YOU ONLY MARRIED ME BECAUSE IT WAS EXPEDIENT. YOU JUST WANTED SOMEONE WITH MONEY, POWERFUL FRIENDS! YES, ALRIGHT! THAT'S TRUE! LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT IT FOR ONCE. I MARRIED YOU FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS, BUT THE FACT IS, I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU. THAT'S WHY I BROKE WITH ROSEMARY. I COULDN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF CAUSING YOU PAIN. SANDRA, I LOVE YOU. CAN YOU FORGIVE ME? PLEASE, LET THIS BE A PART OF THE PAST. LET'S START AGAIN. I KNOW YOU LOVE ME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH! BUT IT'S OVER NOW. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE ME FOR HER. I THOUGHT I HAD LOST EVERYTHING. I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT YOU. SHE WAS NOTHING TO ME. YOU'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN THE WORLD TO ME. I WASN'T GONNA STAND AROUND AND LET HER DESTROY THAT. YOU WEREN'T GOING TO LEAVE ME? YOU NEVER MEANT TO LEAVE ME? OF COURSE NOT. IS THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT, THAT SHE COULD TEAR OUR MARRIAGE APART? WE'LL STICK TOGETHER, NO MATTER WHAT'S GONE ON. YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHAT YOU HAVE AGAINST THE RICH, OR IS IT JUST THE AMERICAN RICH YOU OBJECT TO? OH, NO. I TRY TO BE FAIR. I DON'T LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH MONEY, EITHER. I DON'T MIND YOU, OF COURSE. DON'T SIDE-STEP THE ISSUE. JUST WHAT IS YOUR COMPLAINT? I'LL BET YOU CAME FROM MONEY YOURSELF. AM I RIGHT? YES. I THINK IT'S NICE THAT YOU HAVE MONEY. NOW I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY THAT YOU'RE AFTER ME FOR MINE. OH, BUT I AM AFTER YOU. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? BE CAREFUL. YOU MAY CATCH ME. WHAT'S GOING ON?! I DON'T KNOW! GET OUT OF THERE! GET OUT OF THERE! JUMP, IRIS! JUMP! [COUGHING] [COUGHING] ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALRIGHT? NOW PERHAPS YOU'LL BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY YOU'RE IN DANGER. YOU REALIZE THAT SOMEONE JUST TRIED TO KILL YOU? AS SOON AS WE GET BACK TO PASADENA, I'LL GET ON TO KEMP. I'M SO COLD. YOU OK, DEARIE? HERE. PUT THIS BLANKET AROUND YOU. I'M FINE. I JUST GOT A LUNGFUL OF FLUID. HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. I THOUGHT I WAS GONE THERE FOR A MINUTE. IS THIS ONE OF YOURS? YEAH, THAT'S MINE. SOMEONE TIED UP HERE, GOT OUT, AND WALKED THIS WAY 20 MINUTES AGO. DID YOU SEE WHO? I JUST GOT HERE 5 MINUTES AGO. YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MY ASSISTANT, AND HE'S GONE FOR THE WEEKEND. LET'S GET YOU HOME. OK. MAYBE KEMP CAN SEND SOMEONE UP TO CHECK THIS OUT. OK. YOU OK? YEAH. IRIS? LUCILLA SAID SOMEBODY TRIED TO RUN YOU DOWN WITH A BOAT. SHE EXAGGERATES. WELL, THEN WHY IS THERE A POLICE OFFICER DOWNSTAIRS? OH, TONY'S MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE POLICE THAT I AM TO BE VICTIM NUMBER 3. LET'S HOPE THEY CATCH THE KILLER BEFORE IT TURNS OUT HE'S RIGHT. HOW'S THE INVESTIGATION GOING? WE HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD FROM CAPTAIN KEMP. WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH, MYSELF. I ASSUME THE POLICE ARE WORKING ON IT. WELL, IF THEY HAD ANY REAL EVIDENCE, THEY'D TELL YOU ABOUT IT, DON'T YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW. THE POLICE DON'T LIKE TO GIVE OUT ANY INFORMATION. THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME MUCH, AT ANY RATE. BUT THEY MUST HAVE TOLD YOU THE THEORY THEY'RE WORKING ON. WHO COULD THEY SUSPECT? THERE ARE ONLY 6 OF US LEFT. THEY COULDN'T SUSPECT YOU. WHY NOT? I'D BENEFIT FINANCIALLY. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US? STEPHAN AND I HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN. THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. [DOORBELL BUZZES] I DO HOPE I'M NOT DISTURBING ANYTHING. I DROPPED BY THE OFFICE. THEY SAID YOU'RE WORKING AT HOME. I FIND THE OFFICE TOO DEPRESSING THESE DAYS. PLEASE COME IN. THANK YOU. I'M JUST SORTING THROUGH SOME OF MR. BARTON'S PERSONAL PAPERS. I THOUGHT THAT IRIS MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE THEM. SHE'S ALRIGHT, ISN'T SHE? OH, SHE'LL BE FINE. I'M GOING AROUND THERE LATER. IF THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN TAKE... NO, I STILL HAVE HIS DESK TO GO THROUGH. TELL HER I'LL DROP THESE BY LATER THIS AFTERNOON. CAN I DO SOMETHING FOR YOU? I HOPE SO. CAN I GET YOU COFFEE? NO, THANKS. I WAS TALKING TO MY EDITOR LAST NIGHT. HE'S ASKED ME IF I'LL COVER THESE MURDERS FOR THE PAPER. I WONDERED IF I COULD ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? SURE. COME ON IN. IT'S RATHER AWKWARD, REALLY, SINCE WE'RE ALL, UM... MURDER SUSPECTS? IT SOUNDS GHASTLY WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT. PLEASE. YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS IRIS, DO YOU? I GATHER SHE COMES INTO QUITE A SUM. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IRIS COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THEN AGAIN, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE OF US COULD BE MURDERERS. I DO WISH MR. BARTON HAD LEFT IT TO THE POLICE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT'VE DONE IT? YOU KNOW, IT'S ODD THAT YOU ASKED ME THAT. I DO KNOW WHO GEORGE SUSPECTED. HE CONFIDED IN ME ON THE DANCE FLOOR THE NIGHT THAT HE DIED. GO ON. HE THOUGHT IT WAS STEPHAN. HE'D FOUND THESE LETTERS THAT STEPHAN HAD WRITTEN TO ROSEMARY. GEORGE WAS CONVINCED THAT ROSEMARY WAS GOING TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON STEPHAN. THAT WOULD HAVE RUINED HIS MARRIAGE AND HIS CAREER, OF COURSE. AND YOU DIDN'T TELL THE POLICE THAT? ACTUALLY, NO. YOU SEE, THE LETTERS ARE GONE. I'VE LOOKED FOR THEM EVERYWHERE. BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT HERE. WITHOUT THEM, THERE'S NOT A SHRED OF PROOF. HMM. WHAT DID RUTH HAVE TO SAY? SHE WAS COOL, FRIENDLY. SHE DIDN'T LIKE ROSEMARY, BUT THAT'S NOT NEWS. I THINK THIS BUSINESS ABOUT STEPHAN COULD BE A RED HERRING, FOR ALL WE KNOW. OR IT COULD BE THE TRUTH. THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME ARE THESE PACKETS THE CYANIDE WAS IN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAN'T BE TRACED SOMEHOW. WHY WOULD THE KILLER LEAVE THE LAST ONE IN PLAIN SIGHT? TONY-- I MEAN, IT'S ALMOST SHEER ARROGANCE. YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME. NO, I'M NOT. I THOUGHT WE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT. I PUT THE PACKET UNDER THE TABLE AFTER GEORGE DIED. YOU DID WHAT? I WAS CRYING, AND I REACHED INTO MY PURSE FOR A HANDKERCHIEF AND THERE IT WAS. IT WAS IN MY PURSE. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I COULDN'T LEAVE IT THERE. SO YOU THREW IT? IT WAS OBVIOUSLY PLANTED TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THE KILLER. WHO HAD ACCESS TO YOUR PURSE? I DON'T KNOW. I LEFT IT AT THE TABLE WHENEVER WE DANCED, I TOOK IT TO THE LADIES' ROOM TWICE. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL KEMP ABOUT THIS AT THE TIME? I DIDN'T THINK HE'D BELIEVE I WAS INNOCENT. HOW INNOCENT ARE YOU, TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE? IT'LL BE WORSE IF HE FINDS OUT FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE. LIKE WHO? I DON'T KNOW, BUT LET'S GO FIND HIM. WELL, I'M GLAD YOU TOLD US, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW. I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING WITH ERIC, AND WE CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF THE CASE. WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THIS ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE. NEITHER DO I. WHICH IS WHY I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'D SEND AN OFFICER TO THE HOUSE. BUT ISN'T IT A BIT IMPRACTICAL? YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'LL HAVE THE CASE SOLVED, I CAN HARDLY WALK AROUND DAY AND NIGHT WITH A POLICE ESCORT. SPEAKING OF WALKING, I'D BETTER GET BACK. I LEFT LUCILLA WITH A MOUNTAIN OF WORK. LOOK, THE 3 OF US WILL PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER, IRIS, AND SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH. MEANWHILE, YOU SHOULD BE SAFE ENOUGH THERE AT THE HOUSE. I'LL GIVE TONY A RIDE OVER LATER. THANK YOU. I'LL SEE YOU TO THE CAR. THANK YOU. YOU MAKE SURE YOU GO STRAIGHT HOME. YES, DADDY. [ENGINE STARTS] DEAR, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THAT. I CAN MANAGE. [CAR HORN HONKS] HELLO, LUCILLA. WE THOUGHT WE'D SPIRIT IRIS AWAY WITH US AND GO TO DINNER SOMEWHERE. I THINK SHE'S GONE OFF WITH TONY A LITTLE WHILE AGO, BUT SHE'LL BE HOME SOON. COME INSIDE. I'LL MAKE TEA. WE'LL--WE'LL VISIT. ALRIGHT. HELLO, RUTH. YOU NEED A HAND, RUTH? OH, YEAH, THANKS. THERE ARE 3 LEFT. KEMP HERE TELLS ME YOU'RE AN INVESTIGATOR. I SUSPECT YOU'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING ME. IS THAT CORRECT? WELL, I DO HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND, SIR. I RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM ENGLAND THIS MORNING, FROM THE PRIME MINISTER. APPARENTLY, I'M CLEAN. BY THE WAY, I INTEND TO ACCEPT THE POST AS SOON AS THINGS ARE CLEAR AT THIS END. CONGRATULATIONS. I'M GLAD. YOU'RE SUPERBLY QUALIFIED. I'M SURE IT'LL BE A FEATHER IN YOUR CAP. YOU'RE TOO KIND. PERHAPS THE CAPTAIN CAN FILL US IN ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MEN UP AT LAKE PIRU. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET A DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON WHO RENTED THE BOAT. WELL, THAT'S A LONG SHOT. IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY SHOT WE HAVE. I WONDER IF WE COULD JUST REVIEW THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF GEORGE'S DEATH? JUST FOR MY BENEFIT. NOW, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IRIS WAS SITTING NEXT TO GEORGE. YES. THE DRINK MUST HAVE BEEN POISONED RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES. THE IDEAL TIME TO PUT THE CYANIDE IN THE GLASS WAS DURING THE FLOOR SHOW. WHILE YOU WERE ALL SITTING THERE? RIGHT. GEORGE PROPOSED A TOAST TO IRIS THE MOMENT THE FLOOR SHOW WAS OVER. I SAW HIM DRINK. HE WAS FINE. AND THEN EVERYONE GOT UP TO DANCE? WE HAVE WITNESSES WHO SWEAR THE GLASSES WERE NOT TOUCHED WHILE HE WAS GONE. THEN GEORGE SAT DOWN. NEXT TIME HE DRANK... THAT GLASS WAS FULL OF CYANIDE. MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. DO YOU HAVE A TELEPHONE DIRECTORY IN THE HOUSE? CERTAINLY. ON MY DESK. COULD WE? DAMN. NO, THAT COULDN'T BE IT. I FELT SURE I WAS ON TO SOMETHING, BUT IT-- IT JUST WON'T FALL INTO PLACE. IT'S ALWAYS OUT OF REACH. I KEEP THINKING I CAN VISUALIZE IT. THEN IT JUST SEEMS TO DRIFT AWAY, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA? OHH! WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THIS? AWFUL STUFF. THAT, GENTLEMEN, IS HOW GEORGE BARTON WAS MURDERED. IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN GET CHRISTINE SHANNON DOWN TO THE STATION? SEND A SQUAD CAR FOR HER. GOOD. LET'S HAVE HER LOOK AT SOME MUG SHOTS. OH, ONE MORE THING. IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO IRIS, WHO WOULD INHERIT THE MONEY IN THAT TRUST FUND? AUNT LUCILLA, AS I UNDERSTAND IT. GOOD HEAVENS. IRIS. [HISSING] [DOORBELL RINGS] WHERE'S IRIS? UPSTAIRS, BUT SHE'S ALREADY-- IS SOMETHING WRONG? IRIS! I SMELL GAS. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL IRIS. [COUGHING] OH, NO. OH, GOOD HEAVENS. SHE'LL BE ALRIGHT. JUST BREATHE DEEPLY AND YOU'LL BE FINE. NOW, WHAT HAPPENED? I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW. OH, I THINK I WAS HIT. SHE SURE WAS. I'LL GET HER SOME ICE. NO, NO, I'M FINE, REALLY. OHH, MY HEAD IS POUNDING. WILL SOMEONE TELL ME... WHAT'S GOING ON? WELL, JUST ONE MORE PIECE HAS TO FALL INTO PLACE AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING. [IRIS COUGHING] I CAME AS SOON AS I COULD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING. IT'S MAKING ME ILL. I'M GOING TO MY ROOM. [TELEPHONE RINGS] JUST A MINUTE, LUCILLA. THIS MIGHT CONCERN YOU. KEMP. THANK YOU, THAT'S ALL. WHAT SEEMS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING WAS IRIS' EVENING BAG, THOUGH OF COURSE NONE OF US REALIZED THAT AT THE TIME. IRIS' BAG FELL ON THE FLOOR WHEN SHE GOT UP TO DANCE. THE BUS BOY PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT BACK ON THE TABLE. NOW, THAT MUCH WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN. WHAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THAT THE BUS BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHICH POSITION IT HAD FALLEN FROM. SO HE INADVERTENTLY PUT IT BACK ONE POSITION OVER FROM WHERE IRIS WAS ACTUALLY SITTING. AH, THAT WAS THE LITTLE GAME YOU PLAYED ON THE PATIO. DO YOU HAVE A TELEPHONE DIRECTORY IN THE HOUSE? CERTAINLY. ON MY DESK. COULD WE? DAMN. NO, NO, THAT, UH, THAT COULDN'T BE IT. I FELT SURE THAT I WAS ONTO SOMETHING, BUT, UH... IT JUST WON'T FALL INTO PLACE. IT WAS JUST OUT OF REACH. I KEEP THINKING THAT I CAN VISUALIZE IT, BUT THEN IT JUST SEEMS TO, UH, SLIP AWAY, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA? OHH! WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THIS? AND THAT'S HOW WE ALL ENDING UP DRINKING FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S CUP. YOU HAD MOVED MY CIGARETTES IN FRONT OF YOUR COFFEE. RIGHT. YOU SAT BY YOUR CIGARETTES JUST AS IRIS SAT BY HER PURSE IN THE RESTAURANT. BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS. A MURDERER COULDN'T COUNT ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDERER. ROUND TABLES EACH TIME. THE MOMENT THAT IRIS SAT DOWN, EVERYBODY SAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO HER, ONE POSITION CLOCKWISE. THEN GEORGE TOOK MY SEAT. NOBODY PLANNED TO KILL GEORGE. YOU MEAN IRIS WAS THE TARGET? AND ROSEMARY BEFORE HER. LEAVING LUCILLA IN LINE TO INHERIT. THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS. I DIDN'T DO IT. I-- JUST A MOMENT, LUCILLA. I'M AFRAID THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE WERE 4 OF YOU IN THE HOUSE WHEN THIS LAST ATTEMPT WAS MADE ON IRIS' LIFE. YOU... RUTH... SANDRA... AND STEPHAN. ALL OF YOU HAD SUFFICIENT MOTIVE. ONE OF YOU IS A KILLER. AND THAT PERSON IS CUNNING, HIGHLY ORGANIZED, AND RUTHLESS. WHAT AN IRONY THAT HER NAME IS RUTH LESSING. YOU KILLED ROSEMARY? I'M NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO THIS. OH, YES, YOU ARE. BECAUSE YOU WERE CONVINCED THAT GEORGE WOULD MARRY YOU THE MOMENT ROSEMARY WAS OUTTA THE PICTURE. THAT SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE. I'M AFRAID IT IS. AFTER ROSEMARY DIED, YOU REALIZED THAT GEORGE SIMPLY WASN'T ROMANTICALLY ATTRACTED TO YOU, WHICH MADE YOU VERY VULNERABLE, RIGHT AT A TIME WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES WERE BRINGING YOU TOGETHER... WITH VICTOR DRAKE. MY SON, VICTOR? BUT HE WAS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY IN ARUBA. WAS HE, KEMP? NO. WELL, WHERE WAS HE? IN THE RESTAURANT, ONE TABLE AWAY. CHRISTINE SHANNON JUST IDENTIFIED HIM FROM A MUG SHOT AT THE STATION. PEDRO DOMINGUEZ... WAS VICTOR DRAKE. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. NOT AT ALL. TO BEGIN WITH, FORGIVE ME, LUCILLA, BUT TO BEGIN WITH I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU AND VICTOR MIGHT BE IN THIS TOGETHER. REALLY! BUT THEN I REMEMBERED THE LONG DISTANCE COLLECT CALL THAT CAME IN THE NIGHT CHLOE WEST SHOWED UP. VICTOR NEEDED SOME MONEY. I WAS TO SEND IT THROUGH RUTH. EXACTLY. AND WE ONLY HAD RUTH'S WORD THAT VICTOR WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT ALL. YOU MADE VICTOR FAKE THAT CALL IN ORDER TO SQUEEZE A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS OUT OF LUCILLA. IT'S PURE SPECULATION! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF VICTOR HAD BEEN IN THAT RESTAURANT, I'D HAVE SEEN HIM. YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING TO SEE HIM. BESIDES, HE DISGUISED HIMSELF JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE NONE OF US SAW HIM. AND YOU HAD YOUR BACK TO HIM. I DIDN'T NOTICE HIM EITHER. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW VICTOR? YEARS AGO. HE WAS STILL A LONG-HAIRED SURFER LIVING IN CUTOFFS AND WETSUITS. AND THEN HE WENT TO EUROPE, WHICH IS WHERE I CAME ACROSS HIM. I WAS DOING AN INSURANCE INVESTIGATION FOR LLOYD'S OF LONDON, INVESTIGATING A FRAUDULENT CLAIM THAT VICTOR HAD FILED. [TELEPHONE RINGS] KEMP. VICTOR WAS JUST IDENTIFIED FROM PHOTOGRAPHS THAT KEMP'S MEN TOOK UP TO LAKE PIRU. IT WAS HE THAT RENTED THAT BOAT AND TRIED TO RUN IRIS DOWN. GO AHEAD, PICK HIM UP. YOU'LL NEVER PROVE IT. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT STICK. I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE OF THAT. I SUSPECT VICTOR DRAKE WOULD IMPLICATE JUST ABOUT ANYONE TO SAVE HIS OWN SKIN. TAKE HER DOWN AND BOOK HER. OH, THIS IS AWFUL. HOW DID VICTOR PUT THE CYANIDE INTO THE CHAMPAGNE? DURING THE FLOOR SHOW. ♪ I'M SURE THAT IF I... ♪ Tony: WE ALL HAD OUR ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE SINGER. THE WAITER WAS FILLING OUR GLASSES. WE IGNORED HIM, AND WHY NOT? A BLACK-SUITED WAITER HAD BEEN CIRCLING OUR TABLE FILLING GLASSES ALL EVENING. BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT WAITER. THIS WAS THE MAN THAT PUT CYANIDE IN IRIS' GLASS. IT WAS VICTOR. BUT WHY WOULD VICTOR WANT TO POISON ME? MONEY. I GATHER HE ALWAYS RESENTED THE FACT THAT YOU AND ROSEMARY WERE IN LINE FOR A FORTUNE. TONY'S THEORY IS THAT RUTH CRAWLED INTO BED WITH VICTOR, LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY. IT WAS HER BEST SHOT. SHE WAS MUCH OF A REALIST TO LET HER HEART RULE HER HEAD. SHE REALIZED THAT SHE COULDN'T HAVE GEORGE, SHE SWITCHED HER ATTENTIONS TO VICTOR INSTEAD. AND WITH YOU OUT OF THE WAY, LUCILLA WOULD INHERIT THE ENTIRE TRUST FUND. AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM EVERY CENT. JUST AS I ALWAYS HAVE. OH, IRIS. DARLING, I'M SO SORRY-- IT'S ALRIGHT. I FEEL SO BADLY. I'M SO SORRY. OH, WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN. BUT ROSEMARY'S SUICIDE NOTE WAS GENUINE. NO, NO, NO. I DON'T THINK SHE EVER INTENDED TO KILL HERSELF. NO, MY GUESS IS, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THAT, UH, SHE WROTE THAT NOTE IN A MOMENT OF DESPAIR AND NEVER GOT AROUND TO TEARING IT UP. RUTH WAS JUST ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT, THAT WAS ALL. WELL, TONY, YOU DID A HELL OF A JOB. YOU LET ME KNOW IF I CAN EVER RETURN THE FAVOR. JUST KEEP THOSE TWO IN JAIL, THAT'S ALL. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. I'M GLAD THAT'S CLEARED UP. GOOD NIGHT, IRIS. GOOD NIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU. GOOD NIGHT, TONY. GOOD-BYE. SEE YOU, TONY. GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU. WELL... WHERE WERE WE?
