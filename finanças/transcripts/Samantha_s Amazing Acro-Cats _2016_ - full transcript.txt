[environmental sounds] [alarm clock rings] [cat purrs] [cat meows] [thud] [cat meows] What's wrong, Oz? Oz? [cat meows] Oz? Oz? Oz? [cat gently purrs] [van door closes] [Samantha] I'm used to doing everything myself. Every day I wake up, my back hurts. What day does it all fall apart? I don't know. I think my worst fear is getting old. [plucky intro music] [Samantha] I knew I wanted to be an animal trainer since I was seven years old. Any time you train an animal, you achieve that moment where they understand, they get the trick. -It's called the light bulb moment. -[bell dings] Where you see the little light bulb go off in their eyes. When the raccoon finally understands that you're supposed to take the basketball and put it through the hoop. That's an amazing moment. You feel like this, like a little bit of an electric wave between you and the animal, so there's a sort of telepathy. The first animal I trained was a dog and then a ferret and then a rat. I'm Samantha and this is Julie. We're from Samantha's Amazing Animals, also known as Rat Company and Friends. I became known as the "Rat Lady of Chicago". Whoo! -Samantha! -Hey, Pauly! [Pauly] What are you doing? Oh God! Oh God! -[Samantha] Oh, my rat! -Ah! Do you have real rats, though? We got a whole room full of rats waiting for you. Come on up. Come on, he's really friendly. I don't like rats, man. I'm not into that whole thing. I mean they're nice and stuff, I think they're cool, but you're The Rat Woman, I'm The Weaz. Weaz and rats aren't a good combination. It got me a lot of talk shows, but it didn't go anywhere. [Samantha] About five years ago, I decided that I really wasn't happy doing what I was doing. I had an exotic zoo, and I was doing educational programs for schools and libraries. So I thought: "Well, you know, let's go with cats." [ding, ding] Okay, Tuna. Kitty, kitty! Come on. Over here. Over here. Good job! Roll. Roll. [Samantha] I guess I just got bored with dogs over the years and find it more rewarding to work with an animal that gives you a hard time. Actually, it's a lot of work. It gets harder each year, more expensive each year, but uhm, I want to do this for the rest of my life. And I plan on working until the day I die. There's no retirement in the animal world. [Samantha] I'm one of those fortunate people that actually got to, you know be, do what I wanted to be when I grew up although I'm not really totally grown up yet. Yeah, I don't think you can. If I grow up totally, then there's no way I can live this kind of lifestyle. It's not, well a grown up does not sleep on the side of the road in a bus full of cats. [truck rattling through snow] [sustained keyboard sounds] [human pretends to be animal] Ladies and gentlemen, the show will begin momentarily. -[audience laugh] -Please remember photography is allowed. -[clapping] -And laser pens are not. Thank you. Enjoy the show. [audience claps] [Samantha] Welcome to the show! [theatrical music] Eddy, here we go. Oskey! Puffy and Sookie! Wicky! [Brazilian percussion] [Samantha] Pinky on guitar! Pinky! [ding, ding, ding, ding] My name is Samantha! This is Lynsi. I know a couple of you are probably wondering: "Do all those cats live with her?" Yes, yes all the cats do live with me. This is actually set up in my living room. And the band over there is set up in my kitchen. That is my kitchen table, in fact. I eat standing up or in my car because not everything tastes better with cat fur in it. [Samantha] Living the dream. [Lynsi] I've been working with Samantha for two years. It's like Night of the Living Dead. Zombies! Back! I think I had like a career crisis when I was like getting close to 30? But now like, everything sort of come together. He, he, okay. What is it about Samantha, though, that attracts people? It's because she lives this life that people think about and, you know, they're too afraid to do it. If we could just stay on the road, that's what both of us like to do. [gentle guitar music plucks] [Samantha] All right, now, the question is which credit card is going to work to fill up this beast? That's a great question. Pick a card, any card. Let's try, this is the one we want to use. And this is probably the one we'll have to use. My costs are insane. I have to make $3,000 a week to break even. It's like I can see the island of gold, but the ice is cracking beneath my feet [chuckles]. So I'm like: "Oh, am I going to make it there before the ice cracks and I fall through? Am I going to make it to the island of gold? [cabaret music] I've done a lot of production work, and I need to focus on the produ... on like the production end of things. So, you know, I've got all these videos and pictures, and I've been trying, you know I've been trying to get them to post it so they can... I mean basically, I need my website totally revamped so that it's promoting more production work. I mean, like we're-- we like live in a bubble. we don't know what's going on. [Samantha] Hi, Caesar, it's mom. I told you I'd be home. Short trip this time. Hi! Doesn't really even feel like I have a home, it feels more like I have a work, and I just sleep on the couch of my work every day. Dakota! Pinky! You're gonna miss band practice. Can you do this standing up? -[drum beats] -[Samantha] Good job. I have three different cats that play the keyboard. Pinky's the only guitar player that plays this guitar, and she's always here for band practice. The one day that she wasn't, it turned out she was sick. I had to rush her to the vet she had a fever of like a 104. Ah Caesar, no. Caesar, I know what you're doing. Don't call me an asshole in front of the TV people. Did you hear that? He said A... He goes: "Ass, Ass." You have to listen for it, but he mutters under his breath. [Samantha] I came from Pleasantville. My parents had the perfect marriage, like what you see on television. They lived for the kids. That's where I lost my virginity, in the backyard right uh, by the cornfield. So this is Lincoln Elementary School. That's where the hell first started. You know, I was bullied. I mean I was not-- I did not get along at all here. And I was really kind of an ugly duckling too, so I was like not accepted at all. And guys would ask me out as a joke. Once I hit high school, I was very boy-crazy. I mean I, you know, if a guy found out I had a crush on them, they're like, "Ew!" I was a cootie. So it was not uh-- it was not a good time for me at all. [gentle melancholic music] Dad? Hey, dad. [Warner] Samantha was born in New Castle, Indiana. Then we moved to Dallas, Michigan, where she did her grade school up to the fifth grade. And she was extremely happy there. When she got to Princeton, it was very bad for her. She was shy, wasn't accepted too well. She just didn't have any friends. She always had cats around. As her life developed, she found some relationship with animals that helped fill the void of some of these girls she would have liked to be friends with. She told me just the other day that she, she cried herself to sleep every night. If it wasn't for her animals, which she was always involved in, I don't know what we'd have. We need that right person to see our show and to see that, you know, the potential for money making. We need sold out shows. National publicity. We need a proper agent. Hi uh, are you a cat lover at all? Uhm, yeah. Because we have a show tomorrow. I don't know if any of you who live around here are cat lovers, we have a show tomorrow featuring trained amazing cats. [store owner] Oh my! Here, come on. Have a seat. [Lynsi] We are definitely learning that we work for each other. -Yeah, I know. -Seems obvious, but-- But a lot of times it hasn't been my fault. Yeah. We've had venues that have said: "Okay, we're going to let you book our theatre." And then when we try to get back to them to narrow down the time and the day, they don't call us back. And then we finally trick them into picking the phone up by calling under a different number. And they pick up, and then we find out that they changed their minds and decided our show wasn't a fit for their venue. Or they think it's a kids' show. And it's really not. I mean, kids can enjoy it, but the humor is adult-oriented. It's been happening quite a bit lately. It's, its-- It kind of feels like dating. Hey, Aaron. Here, take some postcards. Hand them to strangers. I'll buy you liquor and food. Hopefully this isn't going to be a rags to shopping carts story, [laughs] Hopefully it goes the other way, rags to riches. [typing] [Samantha] I'm really anxious. And I really didn't do much makeup. -I mean-- I can tell. -You can tell? I think you should put a little sparkle eye stuff on. What am I missing? My ears! Should I do another shot, do you think? Yeah? Tuna, the light! [crowd laughs] -It's the light right there. -[crowd cheers] [circus music] -Tuna! Tuna! -She's making a break for it. Is she making a break for it? Yeah. This way. Tuna! [Samantha whistles] Tuna. Really? [audience laughs] The show was terrible, really. Buffy was a wreck. What was the matter, Buffy? What happened? She didn't, she act like she's never seen the stage before. Pudge, who is usually pretty bomb-proof... I, Pudge what happened? What happened? [shakes cat food] Who else? Who else disappointed me? I'm gonna blame Samantha's anxiety for it. They do pick up on it. [Samantha] Uh, well we know one of the cats had a little digestive issue. And crapped in the carrier. And it's pretty icky. So I'm rinsing it out. Good fertilizer, uhm-- It's not, it's one of the less glamorous aspects of this cat circus. I'm like out here, some days there aren't any glamorous aspects [laughing] to the cat circus. [Lynsi] One of the neat things about Samantha and one of the frustrating things is that she doesn't always think things all the way through. If she had sat down and planned out this cat circus from start to finish, it would have probably been so overwhelming it would have never happened. So it's almost like she had to just throw herself into it and see what happens, and then it is really difficult, but it's like: "Well, I've already gone this far. I'm just gonna keep on going." And she does. I mean, she, she wants to do what she wants to do to be happy. I mean, she really is like putting it all out there for this cat circus, you know. It's like do or die. [chuckles] [Samantha] They're always gonna screw me over. I just don't know which one, which one is gonna fail me, which one is gonna make me look like an idiot. It's exhausting. I had to put a lot of energy-- That's why I don't want to talk to anybody after the show. Keeping that energy up and trying to keep the show funny and flowing while keeping the animals on cue and have, you know, just that whole thing mixed together. It's what I was doing in my living room and now it's out of my living room, in front of a crowd, and I'm shy, terribly shy. The killer of a cat show is when you're like a nervous wreck because then the cats are like: "Why are you nervous? Now we're nervous. Now we're gonna really fuck you over." [Lynsi] Samantha gets a little nervous. It's her show, so the pressure is really on her you know, and I just try to help. [laughs] -So I'll take... -Okay, okay. The chicken will go across, then I'll take that off leave the chicken there put Dallas on the cart, whistle him back, and then you'll have all the time to deal with that. Okay, all right. Okay, I'll try to remember that. -Like here? -[Aaron] Take a look at something real quick, okay? Okay. [Samantha] As I get older, time just slips by. So many times I thought my ship was gonna come in. My sleeping schedule and my work habits, and you know, it's really surprising that I'm not dead or in jail. But now that I am alive. God, I hope I can check out by like 62 or something. That would be-- seem like good, 62. What am I gonna do? Wheel out on stage? "Welcome to the show!" I can buy myself another ten years on stage with uh, plastic surgery and exercise. You know as long as I stay in good health and keep myself in shape, both mentally and physically, then there's no reason why I can't just continue to perform. You know, I've been chasing a dream and never really-- Uh, there's so many things I don't know. I just have to work harder. Things are looking good. I know, I really you know, part of me thinks: "Am I just gonna be a one-hit wonder?" Am I gonna be, you know, another uh, ah ha, you know just that once, you know. I'm just gonna end up, you know, oh, you know, I'll be like: "All a bunch of assholes." You know? [Samantha] I don't want to end up like that. It's just struggling and frustrating because I get setbacks, and-- So yeah, that's my, that's my drama. [Letterman theme tune] Towels, gloves, shoes, children's toys. -One night, how many? -Eleven. Eleven different things. Do you remember the first item? To me, it was a piece of glove that was on our bed. -A little Latex glove, I thought Jim left it on the bed. -Right. -[audience laughs] -It wasn't me. [laughs] Very little. [Samantha] The cat had stole some neighbor's bra went viral, not the cat band with amazing cats playing instruments. And here we're back down trying to find venues. So I might not have a job for like two months. So, what about you? -Oh yes the perfect woman, right? -Yeah, the perfect woman. -She works for Ringling. -Yeah. [circus music] They make her look good. [Samantha] I feel like they don't have the same kind of attitude about animals. They aren't pets. The problem with my cats is that they're pets. Tex! Tex! Focus, focus! [Samantha] Why have an animal if it's just going to be a possession? Well you know, if there's really any joy in that? Feels like there should be some sort of relationship there. If you're going to have a relationship, you have to spend quality time. It's an activity that both animal and human can do together. [Samantha] I've got a lot of cats. I'm not gonna tell you how many. But I will say that I am single. [audience laughs and claps] And I will probably stay that way. [crowd applauds] If you're gonna do cats, you really have to immerse yourself and just deal with the "crazy cat lady" stigma. It's like: "ooh, how many cats do you have?" I mean, it's like I'm a leper or something. It's like: "Seriously, people, it's my job. It's what I do." Yes, I love what I do. I like guys that have cat allergies because then they can never set foot in here and then they never know, they never see it. Because that's like could be the breaking point you know, They see it, they're like you know their eyes get-- It's killed the social life. When I was a rat lady, I got so much game. All those cute little punk rock boys, you know. So it's now the cat-- And I keep trying: "No, it's not cat lady, it's cat woman." A little bit more, you know, appeal. [circus music] [crowd applauds] [whispering] Look at her, look at the flirty stance. [laughs] We have to lower this. -Top one first? -Uh, all right, top one first. [clattering] I just have to, uh-- I'm gonna give that pizza crust to the rats. Or let her-- No, the chickens go-- Everything's gonna go back there. [clatter and cats meowing] [Samantha] Pinky! Can you make it down? Hmm? This is usually like a deal breaker with guys. When they see them all like massed together like this, it's like, "Ooh. How many cats do you have?" Wow, and then they count, One, two-- I'm just kinda going with it because he's all happy and giddy so I'm like: "Okay. Well, I'm kinda happy and giddy too." I'm a romantic girl. I really-- People don't think I am, but I really am a super romantic girl. And I love that teenage love feeling. I really, really like Stewart a lot. [calm guitar music] Oh, and Aaron texted me last night. -What was with the late texting? -I know because he was like, sleeping question mark, and I was sleeping, so I was just gonna leave it alone, but something made me feel like he just needed to talk or something. He's like: "Aw, I was just missing you." He's trying to find a flight, like out on Saturday and leave the next day to surprise me. It wasn't working out. -Aw. -I know. He's so sweet. -Hm. -He is. -They're gonna find him dead. -What? They're gonna find him dead because he misses you so much, he's just, he's gonna just die, you know. And it'll be like, yeah, cause of death missing Lynsi. I view the guy as my reward. You know, I work hard all week or whatever and then I get to spend time with, you know, somebody that's my... the guy of my life. If he's here every day, it no longer becomes a reward, it becomes a responsibility. You know, I don't think married means being miserable. -You do. [scoffs] -Yes, I do. [laughs] Oh my God. This relationship is making me happy and then if it goes the other way where I'm less-- Where I'm more miserable than happy, then I am dead. That's just, you know-- You know, some people like to work through these things and talk about stuff. Hm. That's interesting. Good for them. -[both laugh] -Good for them. [jolly piano music] And now in just a moment we're going to have the cat band play. They're the only cat band in the world. The Rock Cats. Pinky on guitar. Nuy on keyboards. And Fiji on drums. [drum beats] I was planning on bringing Stewart home for Thanksgiving and Christmas and stuff, you know. And, uh, I decided to break up with him instead. Figured if I could-- because I think my dad would have liked him a lot. So I thought, Oh, you know I'll bring home a nice guy, for a change. I was just bored. I was bored. We had nothing in common. Yeah, I had to pull the plug. I'm going to cook my mother's famous stuffing. [Warner] Her mother's in a nursing home. She got to see her first show down here, but she sat in the Alzheimer's section, so... She doesn't know her, doesn't know Sam, doesn't know me. It's a hard thing. So, essentially her, her brother dead, her mother out of it, Sam is all I got. Other than this damn cat. [Samantha] I asked the doctor yesterday about my mom. And the doctor said that: "Well, I'd be surprised if she lived past the summer." And then he's like, "I wouldn't be surprised if your dad went before you mom." And I was like oh-- [ahem] So that was kind of like-- I wasn't really expecting to hear that. So he could go at any time, and I would be like loaded with guilt because I don't come home often enough. I mean, and a lot of it is my schedule and there's a lot of stuff to do. I mean, I'm finding the time to jet off to, you know, Key West for four days. But I'm not finding the time to come here like once a month. So, I mean, I feel kind of guilty about that but, I just don't want to. It's depressing. It's like, it's , it's uhm-- That's where I feel like I'm a horrible, selfish person. Pinky loves me the best. And I love her the best. And, you know, we have this-- She slept on my pillow every night, and, you know, she growls if I move her. And those blue eyes. [guitar twang] [Samantha] I have a lot of cats to take care of. And the medical bills, and all, you know, their medical bills as well as mine. I'm really not prepared. [typing] [Samantha] If I don't succeed, that's not an option. There's so many things I don't know about, like how to do-- Because my parents took care of so much. I just have to work harder, and I'm tired, to be honest. I'm really tired. I'm getting older. My body's falling apart. I can't give up. Are you kidding? If I give up, if all those lives that are depending on me and the show and my abil-- I mean, the last thing I can do is give up. Just when my whole world has like fallen apart and I think there's no hope or something, something swoops in to save me at the last second. Time will solve it. At some point, the answer will come and, and I'll move forward at that point. [street party sounds] Somebody just put a post on my Facebook page saying that we made The Soup, and I didn't know what The Soup was, so. But she knew, so she was like: "Oh my God!" -Comedy Central. -Comedy Central. So-- -Well. -I guess it depends what he said. [laughing] Yeah, yeah. Well, they said you looked great. Oh. [carnival music] [Lynsi] The 24-hour bar. Let's not go home. -Do us. -Pussies! -[cameras clicking] -And I think he's gonna give us a good review. Tell her we're on Talk Soup. See if she knows what it is. Oh, we're on Talk Soup! Do you know we're on Talk Soup? -[laughing] -Yes! Is this our street? [alarm clock rings] Okay, we have to leave in like ten minutes. I know, I'm moving. I'm feeling... woo! Yeah! [crowd chatters] Can we go on the other side? -All right. -Awesome. Thank you very much. Sorry for the late start and the packed conditions. A lot of people wanted to see the show and we weren't really prepared and-- ah! Thank you so much for your patience. This is Tuna! [crowd] Tuna! Tuna! Tuna! [crowd] Tuna! Tuna! Tuna! -Tuna! Tuna! -I know, I know. They were all cheering Tuna. And what did Tuna do? Come out and like roll around and like rub up against things. Her ego is going to be totally out of control now. -[cameraman] It was awesome. -[Samantha] Oh, Good. [cameraman] People loved it. Both shows. Yeah, it was, it was a great crowd, so. [Samantha] There are more and more fans on Facebook and the cat fans out there. I hope that something breaks soon, though, so it's not quite the struggle. That's what I hope. That somebody realizes that they can make money off of me and make me more money so that everybody's happy and comfortable and I can pay people a decent salary. [typing] [audio from the computer] If your cat can do this, then you definitely must love cats. ♪ Yeah, you must love cats ♪ Yeah, you must love cats [audio on computer] The Rock Cats are part of a bigger show called Acrocats. I'm about to meet their creator, Samantha Martin, who's been training animals out of her home for over 25 years. One, two, three, four, Rock Cats! Rocking Chicago! Rock Cats! -[Samantha laughs] -[man] Free forming, man. I like it. -I like what you're doing. -[Samantha] Dewey totally dissed him. [announcer] For one weekend, ladies and gentlemen, and one weekend only, the amazing felines will be in Denver at the Bug Theater. We're talking about the Acrocats. I'm sorry. The show has already started -and we are completely full. -I bought tickets. I know, but you should have been here before the show started. I was waiting for the last 15 minutes. Welcome to the show! They do all kinds of feats. Agility, prowess, pushing carts, riding skateboards, ringing bells, turning on lights. It's truly amazing. Let's hear it for the Acrocats! [crowd cheering] Yes! [gentle piano music] [Samantha] I will be happy being on the road for nine months. In fact, if I didn't have to go home tomorrow night, I would have stayed another night after the show, just because I'll do anything to avoid coming back here. I spent, I spent a lot of time working on those. You are a horrible cat. And you're purring away, aren't you? This is for, for you and Tara. Where'd that go? [melancholic piano music] [Warner] I solved everything. I know. I need you to stick around for a while. -You know, I've kind of grown a little attached to you. -I hope. You know, a little bit. You're not so bad. [laughing fondly] [Warner coughs] [plucked gentle guitar] [Samantha] I thought I was ready for my parents to go. When they went, I realized that I had a lot of regrets. I'm not ever gonna have the kind of love again and that kind of support. [Samantha] Pinky! Hi! Who's my favorite, Pink? You are, sweetie! Hi, Pink. I know, honey. I'm sorry. -[meow] -Come on. Oh, you know you're my girl. You know you're my girl. Come on, I know. -[meows] -Oh, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Pink. Oh. -I know. -[meow] I know, honey. I'm sorry. Come on. But soon I promise, soon. [thunder ] [car not starting] Just a matter of time before this thing goes and I got to spend like two grand to get another one in here. That's gonna be fun. [engine not starting] [typing] [Samantha] Start! [engine not starting] Just set this up here. [clatter of pots] I'm tired. Okay. Out of order. Are you shitting me? [Samantha] I'm tired of being poor. You know, in my 20s, I was like happy with being poor, living on the edge. In my 30s, I still was pretty happy by living on the edge. And my parents helped me out from time to time too, so it really wasn't like I was totally on my own. But now I'm like, you know, starting to rethink. That I may not want to travel forever and ever and ever. You know, I mean, that would just be too difficult. And I certainly don't want to end up in a trailer park. And then I feel like I'm on the verge of losing Lynsi, though. Okay. Well, I should go because I need to get the rest of this stuff in a bag and get it downstairs just in case, it's like, on the off chance that Samantha actually gets here when she says she's going to. Bye. [cameraman] Why do you have a book of diamonds here? Well, did you guys know my dad's a jeweler? And he owns jewelry stores in Virginia Beach and so I'm getting my gemology degree right now. My back-up plan, you know, in case. Can't pin all my hopes on cats. I don't want to be like in my 40's sleeping in truck stops, like pinning my hopes on these cats. And I want to be married. Like what if-- Is my husband gonna be cool? What if I would have a baby? Right? Not saying that I do, just saying what if. So, it's just good to have another option. I would love for the cats to make it and us to get like an awesome gig somewhere, but... I'm about to have an anxiety attack because this crap is in my way. Now I'm going to wash my hands because I stuck my hand in cat poop. Oh, I have a cream soda. [door shuts] Wow, you're really gonna go for the gold. She's picking out her engagement ring. Because, I mean, those are pretty sharp diamonds there. Yeah, that's nice. Nothing but the best. Then, what are you gonna be? A gemologist? -Yup. -Wow. A gemologist slash, uh cat trainer? [gentle music] [Samantha] Shit. Shit. You know, I'm just, just really, really frustrated with the whole thing. I just want it to be done. I just want out. I want out. And I can't, I don't feel I-- I, you know, I need someone up there. Today we're packing. And we're leaving for California. You know, I am kind of settling down a little bit with Aaron. Because I'm in love. Did you hear that? Was that for me? I'm still packing. [Samantha] I don't harbor ill feelings for her. You know, I'm not gonna sabotage anybody's thing. [typing] I cried every day after Pinky died. I put her to sleep and I could barely hold it together. She was my favorite cat. I was her human. Like she loved me the best. All the other cats, they don't love me the best. -[animal-carer] She doesn't want the babies to grow up out there. -Yeah. The guy said: "I can't take care of these." He said: "Someone put them in my mailbox." And I open the box and here's these three little faces like baby birds looking up at me. [Samantha] Aw. Thank goodness you found them and it wasn't too cold or anything. How could you put a little animal in a box and just hope someone else deals with it? [Samantha] I'll take them all. [Samantha] With cats, they don't have the same kind of love as a human love. You know, there's nothing more comforting than like, just lying on the couch watching TV and, you know, just having a cat curled up here, you know, and a cat curled up here, and then, you know, just like Oz hugs you and, you know, animals are healing. They give you a reason to get out of bed in, on a day that you might not want to get out of bed. They, they love you unconditionally. [Samantha] They don't care if you're wearing makeup or not, you know. The love is genuine. [gentle music] It was a tough year, last year. An awful year. Because I missed my parents a lot more than I thought I would. I no longer have that like, validation that, like, somebody that's proud, is proud of me. So that kind of uh, yeah that affects me a lot more than I thought. I was at a crossroads of like maybe I should just quit. I had a crappy assistant. I was just like miserable on so many levels that I was like, why should I even bother? I need a newer model of vehicle. There was a hole in the floor and the ceiling was caving in. That's when we did the Kickstarter. [Samantha] Hello! I'm Tuna from Tuna and the Rock Cats. [groovy music]] So the Kickstarter kind of brought me back to life. A lot of people mentioned it on their blog, and we have a PayPal button, a donate button. Quite a few fans actually donated. Because we had all the support, all this money that came in. We were able to buy the Cat Bus, which is great! Look I mean, it's an amazing looking bus. Fans of the cats, fans from all over the country really kind of kept me going because they came together and came up with this large sum of money. Over $30,000. Jax, Buggles, Tuna, and Dakota. Ta-da! This is the new Kitty City. It's kind of like a studio apartment. We have this kitchen area here where we have all the amenities. We have a sink, stove, uh oven, microwave, and a pretty full size refrigerator. These are the condos. The ones that don't get along with the other cats, don't want to live with the commoners. They really do have the best digs in the house. Welcome to the show! [applause] My name is Samantha. And this is Christine. Thank you. Now, since April of 2009, I've fostered and found homes for 113 cats and kittens. But the other reason I put the show together was to inspire people to train their own cats because you can train your cat to do everything you see our cats do. [audience laughs] It was amazing, and you could tell that they really cared about the cats. -It was cat-tastic! -It was cat-tastic. People think cats can't do that sort of stuff, and it's just fun to, like, actually see them perform stuff. [Samantha] People are just now starting to really see that their-- that cats are capable. The cat-cafes are opening up everywhere. You know, it's the right time. Cats are a good investment right now. I can't imagine anything stopping me, really. It's like a good time to be a cat trainer. No matter what terrible thing has happened, something good has ended up coming out of it. But I will say that I am single. And I will probably stay that way. [Christine] Welcome to the show! [Samantha] I have a million goals in life, really. There's so much that I still want to do. I mean, I'm not done yet. Please welcome Samantha and the Acrocats! [Stephen Colbert] Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for-- the Acrocats. Samantha Martin and the amazing Acrocats! [Samantha] This show is about my life and what my life is with these cats and what their personalities are and where they came from and my relationship with them. I'm the only one that can do the show. No one else. Because it's my story. [theme music]
