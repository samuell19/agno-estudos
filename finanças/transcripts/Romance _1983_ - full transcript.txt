"Don't even ask how..." "I spent the day till evening” God, you know I open the door to your house every morning And there's light in your house. God, may I ask you something? When will you light up my life? I don't understand anything. - Neither do I, Amar. Because you can do everything You are handsome, young and educated. You have also been yachting champion But what is the point of all tips? You don't want to do anything. I am worried.. How will I face your father and.. My friend Ram Prakash after my death The man whose father was the Dean of the University.. He cleans tables and chairs in my church...? It doesn't befit you. Had your parents not passed away in that car accident.. And if they had been alive today.. They too would give you this same advice. Father, I've never stopped you from giving me advice. This is your right. You raised me. You educated me. You are like my parent. Bluff me some more. Use your love and fool the father more. But once in a while do something worthwhile. I heard the Yachting Club owner say, he needs an instructor. The starting salary is Rs. 300! No Father, I need a goal for my life, not a job. The day I find that... - You'll pluck stars from the sky. No, that day the stars will come walking to me. For now, your job is good enough I get three meals a day.. Pocket money, clothes to wear.. And no job is too little. Take your cross, it's made of real gold. Would its' importance be reduced if it were made of wood? No. - Very smart. You're getting very smart but don't reach philosophy to me Go on now. Go. - Okay, father. Dear God, now you take care of him I am tired. How much milk did you get? -5 kilos. Listen, before the customers come add 5 kg s water to it. I know master, that's what the business is about. And use half kilo pure milk to make tea for me and Amar. He must be on his way. Three is Gopi? Tell me.. -Yes? 5 kg s water in 5 kg s milk and 1/2 kg removed from that.. How do you sell tea to customers without sugar, milk or tea leaves.. Tea, piping hot tea. - Here comes the tea. Please give me some hot gram too Tell me. - What? Oh that..very simple. I've learnt a little. Drinking strong tea weakens the heart Too much sugar gives..diabetes. I explain this to the clients and they...become happy. As for the milk..these days cows eat less grass and drink more water! So this has water...? - This is pure. You've become too smart. Here..is your money. For the past ten years, you've been giving me this coin And I've been returning it to you It must have gotten scratched out It's my duty to pay you for the tea And the duty of your friendship is to return my money. Give it back. Give it back to me! Good. Now eat some gram and get healthy. Where are you? What the heck are you saying? It's true. Look, this girl wants pen friends from India. Pen friends..what is that? Donkey. This means making friends through letters. It's modern fashion. You won't understand. Really? I am going to write to this girl. You'll write? - Yes. Why? It's an old book. Many people would have seen this pretty picture And read this address. And sent loving letters. It is said, Ghalib had his own style of expression Hi grandma. Hi, grandpa I am back. Mummy, what's the matter? Didn't you go to office today? You seem to be sorry to see me here. So you should be for I have laid my hands on all these letters! The scheme of your grandparents has flopped. Every one of these letters has come to you from India. Why? When you know I hate Indians so severely! Why this pen friendship with them? If you think through these letters.. You will trap my naive daughter to an Indian.. Then you are mistaken. It's wishful thinking. I'll never let that dream be fulfilled! My daughter will only marry an Englishman! Not with a petty Indian! - Daughter-in-law! You can say what you want to us. But you have no right to abuse all Indians. If you love India so much, why don't you go back to your India? I would go back. I would have gone back if my granddaughter didn't live here. She's the only memory of our son. Alas. I wish our son had married.. Why did you stop? Why don't you say it? 'If only my son had married somebody else.' Your son chose me. It was an error on my part to spend 12 years.. Of my youth in that god-forsaken place India! Where you take permission from society before taking a breath! I won't let my daughter commit the mistake I did. Mr and Mrs. Rai, this is my last warning. If I hear either of you talk to Sonia about India... that will be your last day in this house! I was always against this marriage When I'd tell you, this woman isn't right for my son... you paid no heed to me. And today look how she scolded us before our grandchild! She hates us! Our luck.. That our son got an English wife. He's gone and... - Don't cry. That's in the past. Who can go against fate? But yes if our son was alive... his bride would not dare.. - Grandpa.. I'm sorry grandpa and grandma.. You had to listen to all this because of me! We'll keep listening. We'll put up with everything. Till we get you married to a good Indian boy. Doesn't matter if your mother tore those letters We've had your name and address printed in many Indian papers. Now many more letters will come. And I won't let your mother lay her hands on those letters! Beautiful maiden.. Saw your picture in the magazine And I was wonder struck. 'The happiness you find in your backyard is nowhere else.' Let me see! - The car has come! Darling daughter! Come fast! The postman wasn't giving the letter Your grandpa.. - Troubled the postman. I put my hand in the bag and quickly got out a 50 p I gave it to him and he gave me the letter. Hurry. Your mother must be on her way! Come..open the letter! Grandma, there's a post car inside it. Look...this is Nainital. Yes, take a look. - Really? Nainital! Hey, this is our Nainital! Dear, this is our Nainital. We used to live here. We had a little house here. Look..this is Sherwood College. Your father used to study here. He studied in this college for four years! And here's the lake! - This is the Nainital Lake. Isn't it beautiful? And this is the Boat club. Do you remember I married you and took you to Nainital? I remember everything. The roads snaking away... Those tall trees.. Remember how you forcibly made me ride a horse? You laughed aloud and I cried our loudly! Do you recall we'd go to Diana's Peak in the morning? To see the sunrise! The gentle rain in the winters.. And we clinging close under an umbrella.. - I recall it! We'd be close because of the cold! Let's see what this letter from Nainital says.. What's this...? Beautiful maiden, these are my eyes.. If you like these eyes and they steal your peace of mind.. And take the sleep out of your eyes... Really...? You'll get the second installment of this picture. An Indian, Amar. You do have a style. How do I begin? It's midnight and I can't sleep. It seems as if your eyes have replaced sleep in my eyes One whose eyes have such magic... how would he be in person? I'm eager to see that. Send the rest of the picture immediately. What is this? This is my hair. My hair is evidence that I am not bald. So far it's good. But Mister, where did you learn to torment girls? I admit, you are not bald and you have great hair. But how is the rest of you? I'm sending you three types of faces. Quickly answer which one is yours so the secret can be revealed. Let's see the three sketches What lovely faces you've sent me. I think now I'll have to reveal the secret. Now see what I really look like. You made me wait really long! What...? There's a limit to jokes! Dear Sonia.. The fruit of patience is always sweet. Only yours, Amar. The fruit of patience is always sweet Really? Can I taste it? Whether it's sweet or not You are really sweet. Sweet..and that sweetness clung to my lips. It's a strange situation Sometimes your picture comes alive I'm dreaming while awake. You only dream. I find you with me when I'm awake, asleep, sitting, standing.. Yesterday I went to the park and was lying amid the flowers All of a sudden I felt you were with me. When I opened my eyes, you were really near me. And then I couldn't bear it. How you ruffle my hair! It's not right to manhandle girls You'll want to know, how I know.. The fact is I dream of you every night. Last night I landed up in a fun fair in my dream. There were hordes of people all around And I was walking by alone.. When suddenly I thought of you and it felt as if you were there. It was a sight worth seeing when you sat astride the bucking horse You tried very hard but it was of no use! Finally the horse threw you down! It was great fun! This is how the day goes by.. And night comes.. You are with me when nobody else is around. Now I'm not satisfied with pictures and dreams. I wonder when destiny will bring us together.. "I will demand you from fate" "I'm no longer satisfied with merely your picture” "I will demand you from fate" "The picture no longer satiates" "I will demand you from fate" "Your writing no longer satiates” "My heart beats faster for quite some nights"” "As if my heart slipped out of my hands" "meetings full of love” "How can I fool my heart talking about you?" "What do I tell this impatient heart?" "The picture no longer satiates" "I can bear any atrocity” "But how can I forget your name?" "I miss you so much..” "It feels as if from afar..” "You have tied me with chains” "These distances between your city and mine.." "I wish there was no distance” "These distances are killing” "These distances all the time.." "When will we meet by some design of fate?" "The heart is not satisfied by your rationale” You appear to be very happy Of course father. I feel the whole world is dancing with joy But what has happened? I'm in love father! And who is she? - Here..this is Sonia. She loves me a lot. Now I want to live. You used to ask me to work. Now I'll work and work hard! Well done my boy. Come early tomorrow. I'll teach you tacking Good evening, Manager Sir. - Good evening Amar The club members are very happy with your work Your salary is therefore being hiked to Rs. 400 Today is the first. Can I get my salary? - Of course. I've brought your money along. Son, what is this? My first salary. Congratulations... Keep it. I want to donate this money to this church. Where I grew up. Put it in the church fund. - Bravo my boy. Today I miss your father. Amar.. - Who is it? - Nandu. What is it? - Cable for you. From whom...? Where is it from? - London. What is it? Tell me! Sonia is coming here! Nandu, move! Gopi, where are you??!! Look, Oh Gopi!! You'll kill me! - No, she's coming! Look! Sonia is coming! I'm going to Delhi to get her! Today is a weekday. I have to make payments to the employees. Else I'd have come to the airport to see you off Singapore is a beautiful place. But don't leave your group. She's gone! - Grandpa! Grandma! You are great! Mummy thinks I'm going to Singapore for a class trip. And you're going to Amar in India! Our scheme has been successful. But she'll get off at Delhi The others will go to Singapore What will they say? - Grandma, don't worry. I've told all my friends. They're all on my side. Where are you coming from? Do you have anything to declare? But please just for a minute.. Somebody is waiting for you? -Yes. I'm Amar. Father, why are you looking like this? Amar, I'm looking at the goal of your life.. It's quite beautiful. You've reinforced my belief. Belief...? What do you mean? My Mummy says, no Englishman can ever be happy in India. But you seem to be very happy here. Dear,when God made this earth.. There was neither England nor India These boundaries were made by man. Anyway, you tell me whether you are happy to be in India I'm very happy, father. On top of the world. Have you made arrangements for Sonia to stay? It's quite expensive.. - Father, don't you worry. I've arranged it. Nothing but the best for Sonia. May God keep you very happy. Take a look... These T shirts, shirts and this jean... has been sent by my grandparents With lots of love. Really? Thank you grandpa and grandma. What happened to the love? Have patience. For now make do with this. This too is for you.. This too and this jacket.. Have you brought your own things or is everything for me? Your things are no longer yours. And my things are not mine. Try this perfume. Amar, your friend's address and name has to be entered in the register Should I send it up? - No, I'm coming downstairs. Sonia, I must leave. What? - It's ten in the night. This is India. Staying here longer won't be right. What will people say? - I thought you'd stay with me I will be scared alone. Who says you are alone? My love is with you. But.. - Come on. I'm leaving. I'm going. Please leave now or I won't let you leave. Then don't say, what will people say? You're nicer than I imagined. Who will pay the advance? Keep this 400 bucks. I'll pay you more every evening Take care of Sonia. Sonia is not just your but our guest too. Purse is empty.. Sonny boy, you've enjoyed enough Now only a yachting instructor's job won't do You'll have to work day and night What are you doing here? Waiting for you - Waiting or spying on me? No. I'm eager to know if you had some lemonade What? - I mean did you hold hands or not? Hush. In one night, I've blown up a month's salary. Is the hotel so expensive? How will you manage? For tomorrow's room.. I have an idea. Arrange for a torch and a stone Why? - Just do it. - But why? Just come with me. - But why...? Hey, listen to me.. Will we have to wander in the jungles every night? We'll have to do it till Sonia is around But how long is she here? - As long as she wants. But lions and bears come here.. Listen, don't leave me...! Great! Gopi, look what a big bee hive. What is your impression of Nainital? It's so beautiful that I want to die right here. Before dying, we have to get married Sonia, when will we get married? What is a proposal? In England, the boy asks the girl, if she'll marry her And the girl answers with a yes or a no. Very well. I too will propose to you Will you marry me? I need some time to think. Need time to think! You traveled a thousand miles from England. For what? Marriage is a serious matter. Give me some time to think. I give you time. Five seconds. Five seconds? - Yes, say yes in five seconds else.. Or what will you do? I'll stand in this ice cold water and freeze to death. No problem. I'll thaw you out. The blood of a true lover will be on your head. True lover, be careful. Don't fall. Is the water cold? - No, it's very hot. You'll know when I catch pneumonia. There are many medicines for pneumonia in England. You're making jokes with a dying lover Later you'll cry. Fairs will be held at the graves of the martyr.. What's the matter? I was just teasing you. You've turned ice cold. Then thaw me out. Will you...marry me? Yes. Yes! You cheat! You were pretending! You made a fool out of me! Everything is fair in love, darling Here's Rs. 200 Amar, where do you get this money everyday? What is the matter? - Don't ask. Keep the cash. That Amar wanders with me all night Then he takes her out in the day. Love will take its' toll! Amar, see how beautiful it is up ahead.. Amar, what's the matter? What's wrong? - What? You slept on the horse. Slept...? I was kidding What kind of prank is that? I wanted to see how worried you'd be if something happened to me. Why do your eyes look tired? Everybody's eyes cannot be as beautiful as yours. Let's race horses. Why are you looking at me like that? I should be asking you this. What is the matter? You look exhausted. I'm absolutely fine. You are hiding something from me I'm fine. See... See, I'm all right. I must leave. See you tomorrow. Gopi, come on. - There's danger here. God, guard us.. - Come on. Seems..there's a ghost here - There's nobody coming. There's nobody.. - There is... Nobody is following us. Maybe its a bear. - It's a witch not a bear. I don't have the strength to do this every night. You take out honey.. Don't bore me. Today we must find a bigger hive Sonia will be leaving. I have to buy her a present. Do you think Sonia wants your presents? She only wants your love. What would you know? She's brought me so many presents. Don't I have a duty...? Your duty is to keep her happy! Do you think she loves your presents? If she finds out, you stay awake all through the night.. You collect honey, sell it to make money.. And then pay her hotel bill.. Will she be happy? No! She will cry. It's true... - Don't bore me. Let me work. I'm working for her. Got one! There will be at least ten kilos of honey in it. Light a fire. Give me a lift up. You are in love but don't reduce your weight. Go on up. Reached? - Give me the stick. Make a hole. It's dropping! My pal! You fought the bear! For Sonia, I can even fight off a lion! Let's see how much honey we got. Amar, you got honey again? Weigh out how much it is. Quickly weigh it out. Can I ask you something? There's a lot of change in you What is the matter? The only difference is... Earlier Amar was looking for a goal And now Amar's goal is before him. It's 6 AM. I have to meet Sonia at 8. I'll set the alarm for 8 Amar, go to sleep for two hours Oh my God! It's 4 o'clock! What will Sonia say? Tea? -You...? Tea. I think my clock isn't working. The clock is fine. I switched off the alarm. You did...? -Yes. Tears...? I've seen everything. I know how you paid the bill for Swiss Hotel. But why did you forget that I too have a purse? How can I..your money? What is yours and mine? Everything I have is yours Let's go from here. - Where? Wherever you take me. I want to see all of India with you. "How much you love me!" "How much you love me!" "I will lose my mind, by God" "How much you love me!" "I will lose my mind, by God" "Buy me bangles, slip bracelets on my wrist" "Drop a veil on my face” "Apply a mark of your love.." "..On my forehead" "Apply a mark of your love.." "..On my forehead" "Everyone who sees should know this is Love of India" "The two of us met by chance” "And started to romance” "The two of us met by chance” "And started to romance” "Come, let us dance" "The breeze and the soil here.." "And the water.." "How do you Indians.." "love everyone so much?" Amar, say something. You are silent and the airport is drawing near. What can I say? You are leaving me to go to London. My heart is breaking I am not leaving you. You are coming with me. In my heart, in my memories. You will always be with me. You should've told me of your arrival. I'd have come to the airport The flights were so heavily booked. I didn't know which flight I'd take. It was great fun. Singapore is fantastic! I don't see grandpa and grandma. Where are they? Where they always are. In their room - I'll go see them Grandpa! Grandma! I'm back I see...grandpa...? Now come before me.. Who am I? The person who has protected and loved me from childhood. My dear, dear grandfather! My dear child.. - Grandpa! Somebody look for me too! I'm also hiding! Grandma! What are you doing? Let go! - My dear grandma! Come grandma. - How are you, dear? I enjoyed the trip. I've just come back and I want to return. Are we so bad that you just came and want to leave? When I was there, I missed you and here... And here...? And here I miss the moments I spent in India. Shall I show you the photographs? -Yes. I have Amar's pictures. Show them to us. Let us see... This, this.. Wonderful.. Take a look. - Great.. They are first class. How is there an endorsement for India on your passport? Did you go to India? Why did you go there? Now I get it. But you did this for nothing. Because you will marry the man I pick for you. Only your grandparents won't participate in it. Because they are leaving this house right now. No, Mummy! Please don't do this! Please don't do this! - It has to be done. Pack your bags and leave this house immediately. I won't let them go! Take Sonia to her room. Mummy, don't be so cruel. Grandma and grandpa have nobody else Where will they go at this hour? Take her away. Mummy, this isn't right. Where will they go at this late hour? To Hell! Hell will be better than this house The one you call 'dog'.. You left England and came to India tail wagging, drooling for my son! And for the sake of love and humanity.. 1 allowed him. To marry you. Sadly, my eyes judged wrong I feel sorry for you. I feel no rage. By abusing us... you have insulted yourself, your country and your community. The Indians will forgive you. But your country and your English community... will never forgive you! Come on. Let's pack our bags. Come on. Let's leave. What? - There's a cable for you. Must be from Sonia. The poor thing must be sad. I will go to London. I must! Father! See, I've received a telegram from Sonia! I know. The telegram is from Sonia. Her mother is getting her married to John. And you're laughing? -Yes. Because I know Sonia will not marry John. She'll marry you. How will she marry me? That can happen when I get to London That's right. Go to your Sonia. How? I need money to go there. Are you pulling my leg? - I have the money. God knew it and so all the arrangement has been made. Take this... - This money...? It's yours. - Mine...? - Yes. Your late father had left this money with me for your wedding. And today is the happy day that I hand over my friend's gift to you Now everything will be all right. I will be able to go to London. I don't know how to thank you. Now don't delay any more. Hurry. God, forgive this little lie of mine I sold your gold cross and gave the money to Amar. But you said, love is God. And I have helped love. "I scrub and wash the dish” "My beloved is abroad and I weep like a kid" No, girl. Not bad. There is no shame in dignity of labor. I live on my own... - He, grandpa! Let me help you. - No. You look very happy. And very pretty too. What is the matter? It's very special. Amar is going to call. 1 wrote to him to call at your place at 5 PM. What are we doing here? Let's hurry home! Come on! Sorry, bye. I'm sure, it's Amar. Doesn't matter dear. Carry on. I got your cable. I'm coming to you real soon. Grandpa, Amar is coming! -When? When are you coming? - I'll leave here on the second. And I'll be with you on the 15th On the 15th? Don't worry. I'll come to receive you! Give him my love. - Grandpa sends you his love. Give the line to grandpa. - Okay, talk to him. He wants to talk to you. Amar, my son... - Yes grandpa. Bless me. He says, bless me. May you live long. I want to convince you that you will marry Sonia! That's a promise. Stupid oaf! Says, I love you. I didn't tell you. - Give him my love. Your love..your grandma too sends you her love. Give her the line. Amar, this is grandma. - Grandma! I fall at your feet.. - May you live long. Don't worry. I'll bring you and grandpa back to India. Says, he'll take us back to India. Son, we will surely return to our country with you. We will come with you. Here, talk to Sonia. Don't forget to come on the 15th. I will come to receive you. Take care of yourself. Grandpa, grandma! He's coming on the 15th! That's all right but how will you come here? Like she came today. Why do you worry? You must run away from home and come here on the 14th night Amar will come on the 15th. And I'll get you both married. Then your mother can do nothing! My wallet!! Enough, man. I concede defeat. What do you want? Take it. - Give back my wallet! 1 give up. You run faster than the Frontier Mail. Nobody has ever caught up with me Want to go? Go ahead. Go mister. You were running like the Frontier Mail. This is your last station. Son of a gun! Let's go. I sympathies with you. But I can't guarantee when the thief will be nabbed Write the report. - But Inspector.. I said, file the report. Inspector, do whatever you have to It's a question of my life and death. I have to get to England. My purse had my ticket, passport, money, everything I possessed. I can only try. Please file the report and wait. That's the only thing I can't do. My ship will leave tonight. - I am sick of you. Write the report. I am waiting for you. No Sonia. I'm coming. I will make it. Excuse me...? Are you looking for your room? - My room is here. Please hold it! You are not alone. Thief!! I'm not a thief. My name is Amar. Sister, you were changing so I spoke up. But what are you doing in my room? I was hungry since last night so I came here looking for food Very well, I'll leave. Wait. You called me sister. You won't leave hungry. My husband has gone to get food He must be on his way. 'When the night is so alluring..' 'what will the night be like?' We got married two nights and three days ago. It's a long story. Like to hear it? I can't live without Sonia and she'll die if I don't reach in time Don't worry. I'm with you. I will help you. I'm a journalist, living in England. Went to England after doing journalism.. Been there for many years, became a publisher.. Then got out a huge paper. Of Indians..got it? I had many girl friends.. English, French, everyone but when it came to marriage.. I thought, go to India, marry an Indian girl. And I did it. This is my honeymoon night. Only I and my wife will be in my cabin 'when the night is so alluring..' But awhile ago, I saw another man going in. You can't go to another man's room I will check it out first. Take a look, there's nobody here other than the two of us. Strange. The officer was saying.. There's somebody other than you and me in this room. Can it be possible? what does he think of my wife? She's not an ordinary girl. Why are you blushing now? Now it's just you and me in this room. Won't you drink champagne? Champagne should be opened first at such occasions. One for you.. - I don't drink This is not alcohol. It is champagne. Drink it up fast. Where is the cork? Must be around.. - Cork...? Where is it? Must be around here.. Forget the cork. Darling, you know nothing. This cork is very lucky. Very lucky. Today's date will be written on it. Let me see...hold this. Listen..I'll take a look Your cork. See, I found it. Come out. Careful.. Who are you? Meaning you are a thief! Hiding here to steal something! He's not a thief. His name is Amar. So you know him? - He's just come. Unlucky chap. His ticket and passport got stolen in Bombay. He's going to England to meet his girl friend Sonia. I see... So you don't have a ticket? Neither passport. - I lost it. Do you know who you are? An illegal immigrant! And you should be punished! A minimum of four years of imprisonment! Come with me! Listen.. - What? - I consider him my brother. This is your simplicity. Your gullibility that you consider him a brother. But you don't know such men. They come to England illegally To find jobs and they malign all Indians! Everyday some legislation is passed in the Parliament.. Against us! Because of them! He should be punished. And I'm taking him away. He has neither passport nor anything Sir, I had the passport and the ticket too. My pocket got picked. I know. Go away. What is the matter? Where were you going? Why don't you answer? Where were you going? Mummy..I was going to grandpa's. Grandpa's! How dare you! How dare you without my permission! Take your bags and go to your room. If your grandparents want to mislead you into eloping.. Then I give you a last warning After this, if you even try to meet or talk to your grandparents.. I will shoot both of them! "The clouds of sorrow darken the sky of the heart” "How I miss you" "The clouds of sorrow darken the sky of the heart” "How I miss you" "I forgot the world in your memories" "How I miss you" "The season of flowers blooming has come” "The season when lovers of the world unite” "The season of flowers blooming has come” "The season when lovers of the world unite” "why is this separation in our destiny?" "I can give up this life for you" "How can I erase your name from my lips?" "I can never be unfaithful to you" "We will fall at the feet of death "How many will the two of us fight?" "We will fall at the feet of death "How many will the two of us fight?" "The whole world is against lovers” What's wrong? How is our darling child? Don't know. Can't say. Didn't you meet her? I tried. I tried very hard I even begged.. Let me see my child but she didn't budge. They say, she's unwell. The pigs lie! You could have gone in. - How could 1? There are guards all around. They've turned the house into a jail! Now what will happen? Amar is coming tomorrow. What will happen? We'll go to fetch Amar. We'll get him ourselves. Don't worry. Those walls and dogs can't keep our child away from us Soon as Amar comes, we'll get them married. Then we'll see what happens! He will come. That...! - No, hold on. That is him! Let's go and check. - Come on! He got away! He got away from the police But he doesn't know the streets of London. Who knows where he must be lost I don't know but my heart says..he will surely telephone us. He called us from India. He might remember the number. He'll call. Don't touch the phone, he will call. Grab it! - It's come. Grandpa, it's Amar. Where are you? - Just a minute. This is Lucky Restaurant. - Yes, but where is it? Where is this restaurant? Ask somebody. Yes, I know the place! I'm coming for you. Don't move from there! I'm waiting right here. - I'm be there soon. I'll go and get Amar right away. From there, we'll go to Sonia's place And we'll try to get here from there. I'll get a priest here and organize the wedding. That's a great idea. Hurry! Listen! - Yes? - Take care. They have dogs! - Yes, don't worry. Look..a boy.. A boy called me... Son... - Grandpa You're just as I imagined you to be Son...but what is going on? The cops are chasing you and you're running away.. Somebody picked my passport and ticket in Bombay. I got onto the ship without the ticket and got caught. You came without the ticket...? - Sonia hasn't come? Sonia couldn't come. Her mother is marrying her off. We should rush there. I know you are angry with me. But I know your best interests After all, I'm your mother. What I'm doing is in your best interest You can never be happy marrying that vagabond Indian So, your Sonia lives here. The gates are shut...? Sonia is ready. So is everything Are the children ready? The wicked woman has got guards all around the place. Doesn't matter. Son..see that window up there? That's Sonia's room. And that pipe near it... Climb up using it. I didn't get your support so I'm taking the support of death Forgive me. What..what were you doing? Didn't you think of me? I was helpless. I had no other option! Call Sonia. She would have gone to her grandparents Hurry up. We're very short of time. They'll be here soon. Make the bride and groom sit. Sit dear. Son, sit down. Hold on! Wait. Let her wear the bridal outfit The bond of marriage is tied with the hearts not clothes. Get started, priest. - He won't listen. But I will cover her head with the bridal shawl. Priest, you keep going on. Don't stop. Your Pop can't stop this marriage! Let me see what you'll break! I'll break your head! Make them walk around the holy fire Wonderful. Sonia, stay back Amar, run away son! I can't leave you and go. Go away with Sonia. - I can't leave you grandpa. Go. I'll take care of them I say, leave fast! Don't anyone dare! Your mother will report to the police that I kidnapped you What can she do? I'm an adult I'm marrying Amar out of my will And we have grandpa's blessings Let's go to the police before mother gets there and ask for aid. The police? They'll arrest me. I've come without passport. - Oh my God! I'd forgotten. Then...? When we've left the boat in the sea of love... Then why think of 'then...! That's my goal. He's the same boy. - You mean, you know him? He got away from police custody From morning, it's turned to evening. I can't walk any more I'm very tired. Also famished But what can we get here? There are houses there. Let's go there. - Yes. Why are they glaring at each other? Looks like they're preparing for a war. Sire..the dinner is getting cold. Who gave you permission to interrupt? Say something. Speak to me. Why are you taking your rage out on a servant? Because this idiot has come from your maiden home! Idiots don't live in my maiden home. Do you understand? No, I didn't. Nor can I ever understand! Till you don't give up your wish of going there! Today is our wedding anniversary and you want to go to your parents! Your maiden home is a headache for me! My maiden home is a headache for you! If that was the case, why did you marry me? I'm a man, not god. I made a mistake and I'm repenting! Very well then, repent in peace. I'm going to my Dad's house! Wife.. Don't act smart for no reason.. Why are you standing here? Get lost! I'm going. I was just saying.. Get lost! - I'm leaving.. I spent fifteen years alone in the desert. I won't become an orphan now. Get lost! Goodness! will you do this after marriage? But at this moment, I want to eat not fight. Take this too. Such impudence! I was a fool...that I came to knock at the door. Now..celebrate your wedding anniversary alone. I tell you, I won't come. But don't look at me with such loving eyes... I am starving! One needs food along with love to live. 'When the night is so alluring..' 'what will the morning bring?' We're in a jungle. Why have you brought me to a wood? To raise ruckus in hell. It's a caravan. Looks like nobody is around. Let's take it We're already criminals. My feet ache. Let's go. - Come on. It's an earth quake! Love, it's no earthquake. Somebody is stealing the car. Come out. I see..a girl? So it's a lady. Who else? Who is it? You...!! You're still following me! Today I will finish you! So there's no problem ever! Stop. Don't say a word to him. He's my brother. Please don't make such thieves your brothers. Don't you read the papers? This man came here illegally. Then he got away from police custody. And now he's abducted this girl and is taking her away. Such people should be shot dead.. Fine, then shoot. But first shoot me. Because Amar is innocent. - What? You're so gullible. You're being duped by him! Please listen to me. You have the wrong notion. I'm not kidnapping her. - You keep quiet. He's right. You don't know our complete story. My mother is forcing me to marry an Englishman. So I called Amar from India. His ticket got stolen so he was forced to come without ticket Had Amar not come in time, I'd have consumed poison and died! At this moment, the whole world is our enemy. We have no support in this huge world, no sympathizer. You are an Indian. Show us some sympathy. Please help us. Consider me your sister, or daughter and help us. Else both of us will commit suicide! Wasn't I right? Amar is innocent. Yes, you were right. I am the guilty one. I got this poor guy arrested. Children, doesn't matter. Now I am with you. And I will always be with you. Now we'll be caught! - Not at all. Run away. But the police will follow us - I'll handle them. Why have you blocked the traffic? The police have seen us in these clothes. It will be better if we change. - Good idea. Come. Looks like rain. What do we do? Let's spend the night in this barn The wind is so cold. - Yes. I'll take the lantern there Or it will blow off. "Waiting any longer is difficult” "Waiting any longer is difficult” "Trusting the heart is now tough” "Waiting any longer is difficult” "One condition of love" "Only one condition of love” "The season of spring is only meant for love" "Now that spring is here it is very difficult” "Waiting any longer is difficult” "Take the route through the heart to come closer” "Take the route through the heart to come closer” "Now don't turn me down with your eyes"” "Can't resist the eyes of my beloved” "Can't trust my heart any more" It feels as if we've left the police way behind. Possibly. We haven't seen the police for two days. We'll cross the English Channel in a few days, and go far from England Then what will we do? -Then...? There will be some place in the world.. Where two lovers can get refuge We'll build a small house there. Yes and I'll decorate the house with beautiful things And our children will break those things. They won't be as naughty as you Am I naughty? -Yes. No. Good kids don't do that. A boat! Stop! There's a waterfall ahead. You'll die! Where's my boat? - They took it I can't even drink tea. I can only think of the kids. I wonder if they've got anything to eat. A strange country, strange people.. Where they must be wandering.. They are not lost but are treading the path of truth and God Himself is with the truth. Take my word, my heart says that.. These very people will support their love Because true love always wins True love always does win. And as a British citizen.. If injustice is being done to an innocent boy in our England.. He is not innocent. - Then what is he? Is he a crook? Or a hood or smuggler? Who has entered our country illegally A passport is an identity card Man doesn't become a criminal if it gets lost or is stolen. He only came here for his love. For his love. And love does not belong to India or England! Love knows no boundaries. And I will prove it. Love makes laws, laws do not make love And this slogan will be raised in this very England Your law will have to bow its' head before love. England is a free country. A free country doesn't mean the trees, hills and buildings are free Freedom means the people living in these buildings are free! And the emotions rising in the hearts of these people is free You heard the story of these two innocent children. If you support me... we can spread their love story to every corner of the world. So the conscience of mankind is awakened. And our voice and movement forces the law and rulers... to pay obeisance before love! Please take a seat. Mr. Editor, I... I mean, how do I thank you? You've raised a voice for our children. Mr. Editor, today I realise we do have somebody. Of course you do. I am with you. In fact, voices are being raised all over England for Sonia and Amar. The law will have to bow before this movement No! You are educated people You can talk big. But what do I do? I am an unlettered man. What do I do? I can give my blood for my children! They don't know me. They think they will pressurize me by inciting all the students. They actually don't know me. If England or even the whole world is with them.. I will still fight them I...the grandfather.. Their lives are in danger. In your great country... he came for love. Love knows no nationality Love knows no boundary Don't tie love down in limits Do you see that? Don't hate love. Don't tie love with chains. My brother,love is a law Law is not love. Friends.. My children will die of hunger.. Why? Brothers, my wife.. But we fight alone. "It is the cry of the heart” "The universe of the heart is ruined” "Don't put this bird in the cage of love" "This bird is free" "The world of love is in ruins” "The co lour of love is unique” "It is neither white nor black” "Change these traditions" "Look at these helpless ones" "This is injustice, unfair” Did you see this? How unjustly your world treats those in love?!! I admit, nobody has a right to interfere in your decision But today your slave will stand before you with head bent.. Till you hon our that cross of yours that got sacrificed for the love of Sonia and Amar. Hey, look. That boy's picture is in the paper. The one we thrashed. Was he a big man? Read this. - Yes man. What does it say? The sad story of an Indian lover. Crossing seven seas without a passport... You're not saying a word, just reading away. What does it say? We've done a terrible deed. We do that everyday. Say something else. We ruined the life of an innocent boy. So you've come to surrender to the police? Throw me into jail but the life of an Indian is being ruined thanks to me Take a look sir. It's all in the papers. I picked his pocket. This passport was in it. Have it sent to England Then you can send me to the gallows Sir, Amar's passport has come from India. He was saying the truth. He is not a criminal. Our government too has decided to give Amar a British visa. This police can't do anything! Now I feel we'll have to do something I can't walk any more. I'm very thirsty. Have faith..we may find water ahead. Come ... Water.. Sonia, stay here. I'll get the water. Leave me! You will only marry me. You will wear the bridal dress again and go to church with me. I'm taking Amar along... in case you refuse to get married there... my men will shoot him dead. Take them to the Hunting Lodge. I'll meet you there. They are innocent. We have to save them. Some hoodlums have kidnapped Amar and Sonia. Their car number is H RD 6382 The car was seen heading north along the M1 motorway. An appeal is made to the inhabitants Nottingham shire.. That they help the police is rescuing Amar and Sonia. No Sonia, don't wear this. Even if I lose my life. He will be whipped till Sonia agrees to the wedding. No! - Whip him. No! Don't hurt Amar! Don't hit him! I'll do as you say. Please don't hurt Amar. No, Sonia! For the sake of me and my love... Don't wear that dress. - No, Amar... I can't keep that promise! No! Sonia, let me die! No, Sonia. I will die alive! If possible, forgive me Forgive me.. No, Sonia, don't go! Hold it! - Grandpa! Take my blessing before marrying my granddaughter. You...!!! No! I'll kill you! Where are you off to? I don't accept it. Even if the world is with you.. I will still hate you. The English never lose. Sonia, move aside. Today the clash is between love and hatred In my India, before doing any good deed.. We touch the feet of our elders and take their blessing I want to marry Sonia So I am coming to take your blessings Now the decision is in your hands. Either give me your blessing or the bullet of your gun. Mother, bless me... Give me your blessing, mother Bless Amar, daughter-in-law. I beg you for the happiness of these two children. Give them your blessing, dear I beg you for the happiness of your own daughter! "Oh my God, how much you love me!" "By God, I will lose my mind"
