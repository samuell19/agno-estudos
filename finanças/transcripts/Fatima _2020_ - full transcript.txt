Don't be scared. Do not worry. Who are you? I am the angel of peace. The angel of Portugal. Look. And they don't seem to want to stop. Manuel! Manuel! We should pray. I believe. I believe. I have hope. I have hope. And I love God. I love God. I love God. Pray for peace. Thank you. Professor Nichols. - Yes. - Welcome. Please have a seat. She will join us soon. Thank you. Good morning, Sister Lucia. Of Jesus and of the Immaculate Heart. Yes. Thank you for taking the time to meet me today. I really appreciate it. I couldn't imagine my book completed without you. I just read and very much appreciated your last work. - Thank you. - Although... I don't share most of your views. No, I suppose you do not. In your last paper, you wrote, "All seers are de facto unstable." I didn't mean to offend you. On the contrary, I've always been fascinated by opinions opposed to my own. Well, then we do have something in common. I have so many questions, Sister Lucia. But let me start with the most obvious one. If someone were to say to you now why what happened all those years ago had to have happened to you of all people... how would you respond? Because it was necessary. Necessary? To spread her message. At the time, naturally, I could not have imagined its importance nor the consequences. I was a child. And do you have any regrets? Does it look like the world has heard the message of heavenly peace? Hmm. This is my only regret. That I haven't done enough to please my mother. Which mother? The Holy Mother? Almeido, Julio. 22nd Battalion. Deceased. Auch, Eduardo. 22nd Battalion. Deceased. Corsht, Francisco. 34th Battalion. Deceased. Fernandos, Domingos. 34th Battalion. Deceased. Gomes, Alberto... 7th Battalion, deceased. Goncalves, Mario, 7th Battalion. Deceased. Oh, no. Oh, no. - ...34th Battalion. Deceased. - No. Oh, no. Lopez, Alfredo. 34th Battalion. Deceased. Martinez, Fernando. 22nd Battalion. Holy Virgin Mary, Mother of all Mothers. Please don't let him say his name. I promise I will work much harder for the church and to spread faith. As a family... we are to carry out many penances. Our home will be an example for the church. - We will do this for God. - 22nd Battalion. - But please... - Missing. ...let Manuel come home safe. 7th Battalion. Deceased. Rodrigues, Luis. 34th Battalion. Deceased. Please, God. Silva, José. 34th Battalion. Deceased. They didn't call out Santos. Sousa, Augusto. 22nd Battalion. Missing in action. Well, hello, sweethearts. What are you doing here? I told him to go with Father Ferreira. Ah. Good girl. I will go. - Oh, beautiful. - Thank you, Mama. Fernanda, look. Thank you. So nice. It's nice, isn't it? My son! Ma. We must be proud of them. These young men are fighting to keep our country's honor high. But they also defend our republic. They defend our progressive ideas that will free our country from a feudal past created by ignorance and religious superstitions. We must all follow the example of Nuno and Ernesto. Your Lenten fast is over, isn't it? Let us make a toast to their honor. Joaquim, I'm buying a round of drinks for everyone. Música! Francisco! - Lucia, come with me. - Why? I told you this morning. It's time we pray and ask for forgiveness. She was only dancing. We promised the Holy Virgin, for Manuel. I don't think either God or the Holy Virgin will be upset if a young girl is dancing. I promised we'd be sacrificing ourselves to get him home. Yeah. Francisco. Come and dance. Come. Lucia! Lucia! We brought you a treat! I was hoping you'd come. I'm starving. But... my mother says a little hunger is good for the soul. Especially now. Is Auntie still angry with you? You did nothing wrong. You were only dancing. Yes, I know that. But Mama is scared for Manuel. What does that have to do with you? Mama says I must atone to make him come home. Come on, let's go. Let's pray like we did last time! Ave! - Maria! - Maria! How many did you hear? I don't know. Maybe three. Ave! - Maria! - Maria! Did you see that? - What? - Was it lightning? We must go. It's going to rain. But the sun is shining. - Help me gather the sheep. - But I didn't see any lightning. Come on. Come on! Come on! We have to go home! - Come on. Let's go. - Let's go home. Come on, let's go home. - Let's go! - We need to go! Another one. Look. Who are you? Where do you come from? Who are you talking to? - Can't you see her? - No. - Enough of this joke. - Shh! I come from heaven. Are you seriously from heaven? Will I go to heaven? I can see her now. What about Jacinta? Also. - And Francisco? - What? Same. But... What did she say? I'll tell you later. Our friend, Maria Das Neves. She's in heaven. Why did you come? What do you want from us? You must come back here, every month at this time, for the next six months. Pray the rosary every day... to bring peace to the world... and to end the war. The world needs peace. I want to know what she said about me. Did you tell her about the rosary? No. So, she said I need to pray the rosary more. She knows everything, even our most personal things. Are you sure she's not angry at me? I told you not to throw stones at the boys from Boleiros. Do you think that's the reason why I couldn't hear her? - Sure it is. - But they beat me up. - I try to run away... - Stop it. So, what do we do now? She said we have to suffer. Why? I didn't quite understand. What are we doing wrong? I can't wait to tell Mama and Papa. - We can't tell anyone! - We can't tell anyone! But she said we were her messengers. She came to us. It's our secret. It is a sin to use God's name in vain. Do I need to say making lies up? - Give her time to explain. - Forgive me. I didn't mean to tell them, but... But it's true, Mama. She was so beautiful. And as real as you are. She was sad about the war. But she said she loves us so much. And she'll be back every month around midday. It wasn't just me who saw her. We all did. Yes, but I couldn't hear her though. What if they are telling the truth? The truth? How can you be so sure? A few days ago, Lucy said she'd seen an angel, and Manuel wounded. Auntie, it is the truth. We saw her. And we didn't imagine it. Hmm. Did she say she was the Holy Virgin? She came from heaven. - Did she say that? - No. She did not say who she was. - It could have been someone else. - It was her. Why would the Mother of God choose you of all people? - What's so special about you? - Maria. How can she be so full of herself? António, you don't understand. At first, it was an angel. And then Manuel. Now it's the Mother of God. She must stop lying just to get our attention. I'm not lying! But maybe... I don't know. She was real. Lucia. Lucia! Wait, wait, wait. It's getting late. We better go. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have read The Virgin's Appearance to the Little Shepherds of Salette. Good night. Good night. Jacinta, wait. - Good night. - Good night. Francisco, Jacinta. Jacinta, who is younger than me... was much braver. Please forgive me. I was scared. I really want to see you again. Lucia, is everything all right? Do you believe them? I wouldn't know. They've never told lies. Thank you. Oh, Father. Thank you so much for getting in touch with me. Lucia told me everything. Forgive me, Father. I don't know what happened to Lucia. She's always had a bright imagination, but she seems to have gone too far. And I've already told you, it is a sin to tell lies. It goes against God. Now tell the truth and ask for forgiveness. It is no lie. We saw her. And she told us to come back to see her again. When is this going to end? I'm sorry. Why don't we agree for now and accept that what you are saying is the truth? How can you be so sure that the lady you saw was the Virgin Mary? I just do. You know, Lucia, someone may have wanted to play a trick on you. Or worse. It could have been the devil. Sometimes the devil likes to tempt young souls like yours. He often disguises himself, at times even through reassuring shapes, as a way to hide his evil. Thank you, Father. Excuse me. It would be wise to forbid Lucia and her cousins to return to that place. Do you really think she had a vision of the devil? Even if it was a figment of her imagination... if word gets out, considering the time we live in, it could be dangerous. Anything related to religion is ill-received by many. Thank you, Father. Come on. Let's go home. Lucia. Is it you? Come here. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Hail Mary, full of grace. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, O Jesus. Hail Mary, full of grace. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Have you ever asked yourself why do the divinities who appear in apparitions always match the traditional iconography of the culture in which they appear? This is certainly true in your case, as it has been for nearly all religious apparitions. Doesn't that seem strange to you? No. If I follow your logic, there are multiple divinities. Or it is the unconscious that translates each person's desire to meet the divine in images that belong to their particular culture. You call it the unconscious. I call Him God. Who, in His infinite wisdom, manifests Himself in a form that we expect, in order to help us understand better. So you believe that it is God that chose the wrong position for the appearance of stigmata on people's palms, rather than the suggestion from classic iconography, such as paintings and sculptures, what have you? Because we know at the time of Christ, Romans used to nail people's wrists to the cross, and not their palms. Professor... I can only give you my testimony. I don't have answers for everything. What did I tell you? You can pick one. Would you like some bread? Did you hear about the Virgin's appearance to Lucia? - Mayor. - Good morning, Mayor. Good morning. - Good morning, Maria. - Good morning, sir. - Children. - Good morning. I see you've produced quite a bit of wool this year. Yes. With the flock and the crops, thank God we aren't lacking any food. Or you could say thanks to you and your husband's hard work. You are one of the few educated citizens in this village, and I know how well-respected you are for your help with the poor and the sick. That's why the rumors I've heard about your daughter's daydreams are, to say the least, odd. Go finish that over there, please. They might as well be harmful to the village and to your family. They're just children's games. Nothing too important. I will be more careful if needed. Mayor, you have my word. Please give your husband my regards. I will. So, if it wasn't you, nor Francisco or Jacinta... who was it? Hello, Papa. Father Ferreira, perhaps? I don't know. What's going on? Ask your daughter. Tell me what happened. At the market, the mayor said it would be wise to keep an eye on our daughter and all of this rambling nonsense, or else we'll be in trouble. We've done no wrong. You really shouldn't worry so much. If you want, I can go and have a talk with him. I already have. I told him it was a children's game. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Maria. - Just a minute. Here. Take this. - May God bless you. - Oh, no, no. Thank you, madam. Is this the Santos home? Yes. I've come for the seers. No, we don't have any seers here. Sorry. We were told she lives here. Well, they've told you a lie. If you like, I can give you a cup of broth and a place to stay. But I'm sorry to tell you there are no seers here. Thank you. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Go to your room. So, do you still think there's nothing to worry about? Lucia, we have to go. See what you've done? You deceived everyone. May God forgive us. Let's use the back door. Marques, Alberto. 7th Battalion. Deceased. Martin... Well, I was told she lives here. Ah, there they are. - Lucia! Lucia! It's time! - It's time! What was she like? Did she speak to you? Please pray for us. Please. Please. - Ask her to forgive my son. - I'll ask her. Please pray for us. Please pray for us. Will you stop? They are only kids! Please wait! I beg you! Let's take the way through the woods. ...Serafin. Come. 2nd Battalion. Missing. We must go to church to thank the Blessed Virgin for having protected your brother once again. I can't come to church. I promised the lady I would go back. Will you stop disrespecting your mother? And the Holy Mother? - Let's go. - I have to go. What shall we do? They're all there. There she is. - Look! - Let's go! Here they are, the seers. I was worried you weren't going to come. Please. My son, Diogo. - Can you ask the Virgin Mary to heal him? - Can you help my wife? - Can you ask her to heal him? - Please. - I can't see her. - Diogo cannot walk. Please. - I can't see her. - Lift her. - There she is. - I can see her. That's good. Very good, girl. Papa? Pray for us. Father Ferreira was right. I just saw the devil. He hides among the good. Lucia. We have to pray. It pleases me that you have been praying for me. You must keep on praying the rosary. You should also learn to read. It is very important. We will. We should learn to read. Diogo is here with his mother. He can't walk. He will heal if he starts believing. Mother, thank you. She says God will heal Diogo. He will heal if he starts believing. What does that mean? My son is already a believer. He will be healed, but when? Wait, Benedetta. I'm sorry, Mother. We want to go to heaven with you. Francisco and Jacinta will join me soon. But... She said we're going to heaven soon. But you have to stay. Jesus has chosen you. You are going to be the messenger of faith in Mary's Immaculate Heart. Why does it have to be them and not me? One day... a long time from now... I will come for you. I will never leave you alone. She is gone. Lucia. Lucia! Jacinta! Wait, Papa. Put me down. Put me down. Diogo. Diogo. You are walking. There is one other thing. There was also a healing. Who was it? Did you question them? No. He's just a boy. Diogo Lima. I know him. When I was a child, his father and I were good friends. He was paralyzed. Then, suddenly, for no reason, he's able to move slightly. Some are calling it a miracle. A miracle? When Diogo Lima fell from the barn's roof, I was the one who took him to the hospital in Leiria. The doctors told me he'd start to walk again if he really committed to it and made a great effort in doing so. So, the appearances, the miracle, the seers... it's all rubbish. But I believe that's what people want, nothing else than tales and a divine providence. We need to stop the word from spreading. Absolutely, sir. But it won't be easy. Thank you, Captain. Good evening, Senhora Adelina. Mayor. What harm can three little children possibly do? More than you think. They are roughly the same age as Victor and Republica. Can you see our children heading up an insurrection? Adelina, what is dangerous is what they represent. More dangerous than weapons. What could be dangerous about meeting the Holy Virgin? It is a beautiful thing. And it's wonderful that it happened right here. You and I, we're so different. Yet we're good together. Right? Yes, of course, but... this has nothing to do with us. My rivals will use this tale to attack me. I won't risk my position, my ideas, everything I've built from scratch, for the imaginings of three little children and some stupid superstition. Some stupid superstitions? So you've married a stupid, superstitious woman. I didn't say that. All I'm saying is that there was no miracle or appearance today. Let's just say that... it wasn't the Virgin Mary who healed Diogo. But if he found the strength to walk today, of all days, and in this specific place, then it's all down to his faith. - Mom? - Yes? I want to learn how to read and write. Oh, finally. I've told you so many times how important it is. Because the lady says so. Of course. Now that the lady says so. Let's go. I lost my son, and the Holy Mother did nothing. She let him die, like a dog, far from home. Although I prayed day and night! I don't believe you anymore! I don't believe anything! Just go away! Come with me. Come on. It's best you go home and stop spreading lies. You should be ashamed of having a daughter like her. You of all people, who preaches faith and devotion. If she's crazy, she should be shut away in a convent. Do you see what happens when you make things up? Confess now, before everyone. And let us get all done with this. It's true, Mama. I saw the lady. And I'm not crazy. It takes courage to vent your anger on a child. You have no children. And yours are but babies who live in the warmth of your sound roof. I cannot hate you, because that would be a sin. Ah! "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands, and remain in His love." So Jesus said, "In truth I tell you, may my joy dwell in you, and may your joy be full. My command is this: love each other as I have loved you. Greater love..." What are you waiting for? - Manuel! - Come here. "...to lay down one's life for one's friends." I don't want to go back to the front. Let me stay. Forget her, I beg you. Don't go there ever again. I can't just... Father Ferreira is right. - The lady is the devil's daughter. - That is not true! I don't want to die. I beg you, don't go back to her. Then everything will be as it used to. Manuel, come. Shh, shh, shh. You can't sleep? No. Neither can I. - Papa. - Mmm? Do you believe me? I don't know. I know I'll never leave you. But I thought it was such a beautiful thing. Yes, it is beautiful. Then why does it seem like I'm hurting everyone? At times, our special gifts can lead to trouble. People can get jealous. Others might not understand. Come on. Whenever. Please, Father. Get out. Get out! This is my field! We didn't know where to settle down. We're here for the Virgin. We've all come from far away. You've... You've destroyed... This is our crop. This is... I'm sorry. We are going to leave after the appearance. Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts... Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts... ...which we're about to receive from Thy bounty... ...which we're about to receive from Thy bounty... - ...through Christ our Lord. - ...through Christ our Lord. - Thanks be to God. Amen. - Thanks be to God. Amen. Amen. Give me the wine. Papa is worried, and it's all your fault. This coming winter, we won't have anything to eat... Stop it. Don't insist. Serve yourself. At the market the other day, I saw Dona Clara. Are you listening, António? Yes. Can you help me here, please? She said she was looking for someone to help her around the house. - And she asked about Carolina. - No. But the Gomezes are good people. Do you think I like the idea of sending our daughter off to work? I didn't mean to. I have the feeling we are losing everything we love... and have built so far. I feel useless. I don't want you to go. I won't. I beg you! I don't want other people suffering! I do this for the sinners! As you asked! Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? But how did you, Francisco and Jacinta endure it all? You were only ten years old. But what strikes me even more is the message you claim the Virgin charged you with, a message of suffering and atonement. Why would she choose you, a child, of all people? There was just one moment when I couldn't understand. But we were willing to put up with it all. I know. It's hard to understand for someone who's not a believer. I understand. Innocent messengers make the message all the more sacred and unassailable. But at what cost? Do you really think that's what your God wants? It seems contrary to all logic to me to ask little children... seven, eight, ten-year-olds... to suffer and make sacrifices the way you three did. Sure, you could tell me that Christ sacrificed himself. But he did it for his beliefs, his ideas. But he was a grown man. Faith begins at the edges of understanding. But it's there where scientific research for the truth should begin. But then what is faith if not the search for truth? An inexplicable truth which breeds irrational hope. Mama, it is far too hot for you here. No, I'm fine. Greetings, Mayor. The men are ready. I can give them the order to have it cleared. No, there is no point. There are too many people. They're not talking to anyone. And nobody believes me. Can I ask you for a miracle so that everyone will know you appeared to us? Soon she will perform a miracle for everyone to see, so you can believe it is true. So, why doesn't she do it now then? He's right. Because it is all a lie. - There is no appearance happening. - Shh. You must pray often... and suffer greatly. Sacrifice yourself for sinners. Do not hurt yourselves with ropes. And repeat this prayer. O Jesus. O Jesus. O Jesus. I'm offering you this... I'm offering you this... I'm offering you this... ...in exchange for your love. ...in exchange for your love. ...in exchange for your love. For the conversion of sinners... For the conversion of sinners... ...and to amend sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary. ...and to amend sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary. What was that? That was hell. Where the sinners' poor souls go. If we do not stop insulting God... there will be a war worse than this one. This is what will happen if sinners do not convert. Do not tell anyone what you have seen until I tell you to. Why is she crying? Tell Papa what happened. The lady told me not to tell anyone. She said we had to pray and repent for our sins. - We need to pray. - She's right. The seer is saying we must ask for forgiveness for our sins. As I told you before, you can't keep a secret from a priest. Father Ferreira is right. He's a man of God. Father, I told her, but it's useless. Stay back! Stay back! This is a house of peace. Please take your guards away. Rallies are illegal. I did warn you. Remove all these people from the church. They have to go back to wherever they came from. Go. Stop! Will you stop, please? There's no need for violence. I will exit with all my faithful. Let the priest guide them out. Artur, stop. How can you do this? This is absurd. I'm doing this for you. Would you like people to talk about a priest in Fátima who's being fooled by three lying children? This is not faith. This is superstition, and we both know it. No. So your answer to this is pushing out all the faithful who came here for confession and bolt the church? Your mother used to come here often, and she would bring you with her. My mother was illiterate. Unfortunately for you, I'm not. - I'm different. - Knowledge means tolerance. Until order is restored, the church stays closed. He had them shut down the church. - That's never happened here. - Adelina, enough! These issues do not concern you. Yes, they do. Read this. It's from Lisbon, requesting an explanation and instructing me to restore order. This is not an easy time for me, Adelina. Please try to understand that. And don't make things even more difficult for me like you did today. So, the Virgin has revealed some secrets to you. Apparently, she told you not to say anything about these secrets, not even to your bishop. Yes, Excellency. But I thought you said you could not hear her. Is that right? We told him. We tell him everything the Virgin says. I am not talking to you now. So, you said you cannot hear her because you haven't prayed the rosary enough. I... I don't know. But the Virgin did not explain why, of all people she might have appeared to, she chose a boy who doesn't pray enough. How long is this torture going to last? Father, he's been asking the same question for the last two hours. As long as the monsignor deems necessary. Jacinta. Tell me the truth. Whatever the truth may be, it won't only be the parish who will pay, but all the Church of Portugal. I'm going to see Tio Anastacio. Can you please go? That's enough. - Can you go back? Just go back. - Please. Please. Freire, Eduardo. 19th Battalion. Deceased. Filipe, Paulo. 19th Battalion. - Good morning. - Good morning. The last time I heard from my eldest son was two months ago. Gavinho, Eduardo. 19th Battalion. Deceased. Mama, are you all right? Yes. Sales, Francisco. 11th Battalion. Deceased. Santos, Manuel. 4th Battalion. Missing in battle. That's it. Every time I read the name of one of our boys who lost his life - defending the ideals of our republic... - Mama. - ...I have great admiration for them. - Mama. But also immense pain. Mama. - Please. - But today I ask you... Mama. ...if the Virgin has appeared for real in Fátima, then why on earth didn't she protect these poor young men and spare their families this awful pain? The mayor said he's lost, not dead. - The lady will help us. - Oh! You mustn't say her name in my presence! But it is true, Mama. - For the sinners... - Oh, stop making fun of me! Do you hear me? Don't make fun of me! If Manuel doesn't come back, it's all your fault. Papa. I'm going to sell the herd. There's no need for you to go to Cova da Iria anymore. I understand you are no longer so sure of what you have said. - Yes, she is. - Tell him. - Let her speak. - Jacinta. Shh. You heard your mother. Say what you must. You caused the church to be shut down. Do you understand how serious that is? All you need to say now is, "I made everything up." And everything will be solved. Thank you. I don't know anymore. Please. So? Lucia, you don't have to worry anymore about what you told me yesterday. Sometimes we lose ourselves. What I need to hear... is what you are feeling deep down. Hmm? I will speak to the Curia. Your behavior is ridiculous. - Excellency. Excellency. - Please pray for me. - Please pray for me. - Please bless us. Can we pray with you? Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Did you ever have doubts about what you'd seen? Did you never once thought, not even later on, that your imagination might have been sparked by... influenced by circumstances? War, hunger, solitude. A lack of affection. Why would I have? The Virgin appeared in order to save us from those circumstances. The Virgin appeared to save you from... from your mother? Hmm. It appears that Jacinta was the most mystic among you. Yes, she was. Maybe because she was younger. She was only seven. Maybe because you two were older and she was trying to outdo you. No. She was that way. She had a gift. Did you see her body after she was exhumed? Yes, I saw it. It was completely intact. And you naturally believe... it is just a coincidence? No, it's different. I think it's incredible and unexplainable. But not everything unexplainable is necessarily transcendent. Sometimes it's just that we are limited. Therefore, fortuitous, unexplainable circumstances? Sorry. Sometimes I have to tease you. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing my job. Which one? Helping me with my book or converting me? Do what the Virgin tells you to! Pray the rosary! Rosaries! Rosaries! Six cents! Would you like the Virgin's rosary? Where are the seers? It's almost midday. I don't know, madam. Thank you. Rosaries! The Virgin's rosaries! We came to see our children. We only take orders from the captain. - Or the mayor. - The mayor fooled us. He told us he would have brought them to Father Ferreira's house. To question them. And here he is. - Please, at least let me come in. - No. You must let us in. We need to speak to the mayor. That's impossible. - I want to see our children! - No. - I want... My child is in there! - António! - My child is... - António! - Don't! - No, no! Stand back. Go on, have some food. Don't be afraid. So, why are you doing this? Hmm? Because I'm hungry. Not that. When was the first time you had the idea of seeing the lady? Who is behind all of this? Your mother loved Manuel very much. Her only son. I remember he was a smart boy. Handsome too. Your mother just wanted him to come home. For all that time, it was as if you didn't even exist. And now Manuel is dead. And your mother blames you. She's angry at you. That must be very painful. Isn't it? Well, yes. Yeah. I understand what it means to, uh... long for... to wish for someone's love. So, uh... one day you were feeling lonely and hurt. And you imagined another mother. And I know you did tell your cousins, "It's all just a game." But little Jacinta, who worships you, believes your game - to the point it becomes real. - That's not true! I saw her. But now, if you tell everyone it was just a game, you know they'll all be disappointed and angry. And you don't know how to stop this game, do you? I don't want to fool anyone. I'm so sorry you couldn't see her. Thank you for coming all the way here on such short notice. The health authority explained the urgency. Your medical opinion is very important to us, and it will help us resolve this matter. ...pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Let me show you where the children are. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women... I asked you for one thing only: not to let yourself be seen with those people. Free the children. Let them go. Adelina, they're being seen by the psychiatrist. Please don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Just go home. Are you sure you're doing this just because of the pressure coming from Lisbon? You should be worrying about our children. Now leave me and let me do my job. Answer my question. Release those children, Artur. - There's a limit to everything. - Exactly. So please go home and don't let anyone see you with those people ever again. And don't you force me to choose. Mayor. The doctor's ready to see you now. Please send him in. If you could escort my wife, she was about to leave us. Yes, sir. What about them? - What should we do? - Let them pray. I'm sure they'll get tired of it eventually. I'm sorry. I spoke to them in detail. I didn't find any type of pathology, neither physical nor mental, that could justify a forced hospitalization. You could still give me some kind of proof or a tool to prove their dishonesty. I mean, this tale would collapse in no time. The only thing I can give you is this copy I prepared for the authorities in Lisbon. Thank you, Doctor. Glory be to the Father... and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Over there, children. - Mama! Mama! - Lucia! Lucia! - Mama! - Lucia! Oh! Are you all right? - I missed you. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. I love you. - Goodbye. - Thank you, Doctor. She is very weak. Just a moment, please. Get her something to eat. And make sure she gets some rest. Try some steam inhalation. Can you please wait, Doctor? - Thank you. - Goodbye. Thank you, Doctor. We're in dire need now. So where is your lady? - Leave her alone. - Stop it. I want you all here by my side. All of you. You, too, Lucia. Lucia. Come. God has given me the blessing. He wants to take me to Manuel. That's enough. Maria, please. Enough of this nonsense. The doctor did not say you were passing. Lucia. Where is she going? Lucia. Lucia. I think it's time to go. I'm sure Mama is feeling better now. Father. António, I came because I have some good news. It's from Manuel. He's alive. He's alive. The military chaplain wrote the letter. He says he's wounded, but not seriously wounded. Thank God for that. Thank you. Lucia. Manuel is alive. Manuel is alive! Manuel is alive. He's... He's alive. Oh, he's alive. It appears your prayers have been answered. My mother always said I was not good at convincing people. I have never thought it possible to convince you. You haven't. Don't be getting too confident. I hope our meetings will be good for the writing of your book. Not only in that. Professor Nichols, your taxi is here. Thank you. I'll be right out. Thank you, Sister. If I remember correctly, there was a great controversy over the fact that the Virgin claimed the war would end on the day of the miracle. It is appropriate to remind you... We don't want to wait. We're tired. Nobody asked you to come! She won't come. It's raining too much. Six cents! Rosaries! Rosaries! Rosaries! Rosaries, six cents! Rosaries! Blessed by the seers themselves! Go, go, shout more. - Rosaries! - Rosaries! - Blessed by the seers themselves! - Rosaries! Rosaries! Thank you for coming, sir. - Have I missed anything? - No. Nothing has happened yet. Just rain and people praying. You wouldn't want someone like me to miss out writing about this possible miracle. No. It's the only topic being discussed in Lisbon. Hello, my children. Thank you for coming to see me. Can you please tell us who you are? These people want to know. There she is. I am the Lady of the Rosary. I am going to lead them to my son through peace and love. She says she's the Lady of the Rosary! Rosaries, now ten cents! She will lead us to her son through peace and love. They must not insult the Lord, who is already far too insulted. You have to pray. Pray the rosary every day! And you mustn't insult the Lord. He's already far too insulted. The war will end soon! And our soldiers are to return home to their families. Look at them. A huge crowd of people hanging on to every word a little lying, stubborn and ignorant girl is saying. Some people are never going to believe. Even when standing before the face of God. Look. The sun! The sun is falling! Move out of the way! Move out of the way! Victor! Republica! Thank you. Go. Lucia. - Please help. - Lucia, we love you. We'd better go. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
