There's kind of a restless crowd out there tonight. A lot of them seem to have shiny noses. Shiny noses? Is that a theatrical term? You know, I mean, some of the crowd walked out. Look, we're playing the intermission, ain't we? Certainly the people want to go out for a smoke and powder their snozolas. Maybe it's us playing intermissions that I ain't used to. Look, as soon as we finish breaking in this new act, we'll get better spots. Now, you could have figured that out for yourself. You just use your brains. Well, you can't expect brains from a guy who plays the character like what. - Look him. - What's he worried about? Oh, don't give it a thought. Eight years I've been doing a two act with that guy and for eight years I gotta put up with his belly aching. Howdy, kids. Howdy. Nice going tonight. Hello, Mr. Barney. Did you really like us? It's a swell act. I never saw better. Me too? Now, who could complain about you? Lady with a figure like yours, with that voice and personality. Say, I hope they're paying you enough dough. You know, darling, if I hadn't met you first, he'd be the one. - Come in when you're dressed. - Okay. Mr. Barney. Can I pick him? - Is that 24 carat, isn't? - Yes, sir. That's a beautiful girl. She's got a lot of talent. You know, that girl was selling cigarettes in a rink out of Kansas City when I first met her. Happened to hear her sing here. Well, well, well, that certainly is wonderful. I was telling Mr. Maxwell. He's the boss, you know? I really never enjoyed an act more. Know, I think he's dead wrong about letting you out. Out? He's firing us. Why? Well, they say that a singer don't belong in an ice skating act. That skating is one form of entertainment and singing is another form. That you put the two of them together and they spell shiny noises. That's funny, you know, those are almost the exact words that they used. But, Larry, can they fire us? We've got a week's contract. Four more days to go. Ah, don't you worry about that. I like you folks so well that I've got it all fixed. Here you are. Salary for the full week. Well, as I said, I think they're making a mistake. So long, boys. All right, Nolan. Now let me tell you something, Mr. They're never going to do anything like this to us again. Well, no. Sure, why should that... Because we're going to be the sensation of the country, that's why. I'm going to do things on ice that have never been done before. I'm going to tell stories on ice. Stories especially written for singers and dancers and skaters. And you can tell that boss of yours that he'll begging on bended knees someday for my ice folly. Sure, I'll tell him. Good luck, boy. Let me know when you get it all set. - So you saw this coming? - Me? Oh? Well, I happen to look into my crystal ball. - The one that tells the future. - Yeah. Go ahead, tell me. You're right. I'm wrong. Oh, no. I never crow when another guy lays an egg. Well, I haven't laid an egg, pal. I'm right and they're wrong and you're wrong. And someday I'm going to show all of you. Because I've got ideas... - It's me. - Oh, come in. Honey. There's a nasty rumor going around that it takes women a long time to get dressed. Seeing you still in negligee. Yeah, quiet, honey. Go and get your bags packed, will you? Why, what's happened? I quit! You quit? When they like us so much? Why? I'm just sick of working in joints like this and getting paid off in peanuts. - Darling, you can eat peanuts. - Say, now, what is this mutiny? Who's running this show? You are, of course. But I thought... Yeah, well, just let's not have any back talk from the help. Well, that was a brilliant career I had. - A little short. - But, honey. Are you leave our lives in my hands, will you? A word of honor. I'll take good care. And stop giving me this what and where and what for business and just keep yessing, me. You won't regret it. All right, ask me something. You're crazy about me, aren't you? Yes. I'm the big shot in your life, ain't I? Yes. In all your life, did you ever meet anybody as handsome, as talented, as all around wonderful as I am? Oh, yes. That's a bad question. All right, now, keep giving with ahead. That's it. Keep it up while you're packing. Go on. Mr. Gable's car. Mr. Gable's car. - Where'd you park the car? - About a block down the street. Well, you two wait here. I'll go get it. Okay. - Miss Lloyd's car. - Want Peanuts, honey? Mr. Tracy's car. Mr. Tracy's car. Mr. Taylor's car. Not worrying? - No if you say not. - Well, just don't. Because someday we're going to have everything those people got. They're going to be calling out for our car when we come out of places, and they'll be staring at us and putting our pictures in the paper and everything. All that flush and glitter out there. You're going to have that, too, honey. Only more so. May I have mink coat, Mr. To keep out the cold winter wind? Yeah, sure you can. Another one to keep out the summer heat. - Diamonds and pearls. - Peanuts and popcorn. And peanuts and popcorn. Hey, cut out that noise and keep moving. What am I supposed to do? Play leaf frog with that car in front of me? I got people waiting over there. I said not to do that. All right, then you call them for me. Mr. Larry Hall's car. Mr. Larry Hall's car. I can't believe it. They're calling out our car. Well, do I or don't I? Keep my promises? Mr. Robert Young's car. - Mr. Tolliver's Car. - Mr. Tolliver's Car. - Good night, Roger. - Good night, Mr. Tolliver. - Good night, Roger. - Good night, Roger. Well, that's a dirty trick, sonny boy, hitting the guy from behind. You did my car about $10 worth of no good. Why didn't you move on? Listen, buddy, if I should start moving on to you, and I certainly got a yen, too. Let's not argue about this. If it's our fault, we'll take care of the damage here. Look me up and send me the bill. Henry. We're holding up the traffic here. Well, next time you get a chauffeur, why don't you try one that can drive? Well, fellas says he'll take care of the damage. Douglas Tolliver, producer, Monarch Studios, Hollywood. Big shot. Maybe we can circle for a couple of new fenders, too. We need them. Sam going to send off some telegrams after a while to ice rinks, asking if they can use a good act. Anybody object? I said I'm going to send off some telegrams. Oh, so you're going to send telegrams, Mr. Burgess? Yes, I am, Mr. Burgess. Well, I think that's a very good idea, Mr. Burgess. Oh, I get good ideas now and again, Mr. Burgess. What's the idea of talking to yourself? Well, that way somebody listens to me. Say, kids, I've been thinking. Maybe if we get a chance to send telegrams off to... I've been robbed. How are we going to break it to Eddie? Well, we'll be subtle about it. I'll show him the license. Fooling. I'm scared. Well, I mean worried. Oh, nice talk. A 3 hours old bride. - Suppose he doesn't like it? - We're over 21. He loves us both. - Yeah, but you've been pals a long time... - Wife. You're crazy. That's one of the reasons I married you. What chance do you think you would have had if I'd been all right mind. Now, that's enough lip from you. A little more lip. - Come on. - Oh, no. Bride's got to be lifted over the threshold. It's a very important custom. All right. Come on. Better not get used to this. Not going to happen again. There. Something else we got to have. Something old and something blue. Something old, something blue. There it is. Where have you two been all night? Guess that, pal. We got news for you. News for you, too. Answers to my wire. - Sorry, we have no dates open. - You hold them up. I'll tell him; - Eddie, we're married. - Cost me $4 to send you're. What? Married. Us. Yuma, Arizona, this morning. Yeah? Well, react. Come on. Give out. With many happy returns. Condolences. Congratulations. But say something. Sure. Excuse me. Congratulations. - That's better. You can even kiss the bride. County bride. - Just this once. Say. Ah, it's too bad about these guys. Would you wire Hodges? I figured to do it direct and save the agent's fee. Oh, no, I don't mean about a job. He knows people with dough. Dough to put up for my follies. I was only thinking of work. Oh, a small time guy. Bread and butter, and he's satisfied. Look, I'm a married man now. I got to buy a mink coat. Well, you ain't the type to wear mink. Now, if you said early... All right. I'll wire hodges myself. Be back. Now. Look. A face only near sight of mother could love. - Did you fly to Yuma? - Yes. Must be a nice trip. Me and Larry flying myself. Birds don't try to ride an automobile, so... - Eddie. - What? - Why don't you say it? - Say what? Trully you think about Larry and me getting married. What? I like it. - Say, I have coffee on... - Eddie, please. What? I like it. Only... Only what? How does a guy start? They cut my tongue. Not that hurt, either one of you. Eddie, I want to hear. Well, it's nothing, except that he used to be on ice Gable is on picture screens. Now He's last summer's straw hat. I thought I was going to be a help to him. And I'm not. I'm holding him back. Instead. He'll keep on getting fired. First he'll blame audiences. His position on bills. Anything and everything but me. Then he'll get to realize what's really holding him back. - Maybe he'll hate me then. - Snap out of it, kid. Just remember, I'm a sap. Half the time I don't know what I'm talking about. Tell Larry I'll be back. Hey, walking out won't solve anything. I'm not walking out. Bride's got to have a new dress. Everything happens so quickly. I'll be back. Yes, sir. Send in the second draft of Morality script. Yes, sir. He wants the second draft. Who? Did you say? Yes, yes. No, not Hanley. Mr. Tolliver doesn't think he's the type for Jim. Yes, Mr. Tolliver. I'm reading a script. I can't see anybody. - Tell to try again tomorrow morning. - Yes, sir. No use waiting. Mr. Tolliver isn't seeing anyone. But Effie. I've had my people here for 4 hours. Sorry. - Come on, girls, let's get out of here. - Please, I must see Mr. Tolliver. Honey, there ain't a chance. Not today. - It's very important. - I'm sorry. You heard what he said. - Yes, sir. - Bring your notebook. Come in, please. Yes, sir. Look, he wants to see me. He even gave me his card. - There. - He never does that. Well, I'll try. But honest, I doubt if you can get in today. Effie. Scene 14. I want Alice's speech changed. She'll be made stronger Put more emotion in it. There's a girl waiting outside, Mr. Tolliver. And scene 29. This manuscript has Lady Hilda talking like a teleman girl. She's supposed to be an English lady. I want her written that way. Yes? She says you gave her your card. - Who says I gave her what? - The girl that's outside, your card. My card? That's nonsense. Effie. - Yes, sir. - And scene 31. Frank speech. Change that to read. - How do you do, Mr. Tolliver? - How do you do? - Who is this - The girl that was waiting outside. A young woman. There must be some mistake. We have no appointment. What's more, I'm not engaging any talent today. I didn't come here for an engagement, Mr. Tolliver. What do you want? You bumped our car last night in front of the Ice Palace. The damage amounted to $10. I'd like that money, please. You might have mailed the bill to me. However, make out a check for this young lady. - What's your name, please? - Mary McKay. And I don't want a job in motion pictures. You must be often bothered by girls who want jobs in pictures. Quite often. Must be a relief to find someone that's entirely uninterested. It is indeed. - What did you say? - That I'm uninterested. Oh, is it? You feel superior to this sort of work? Perhaps I do. I would imagine that any young woman who's offered an opportunity in moving pictures would be very anxious to accept. But all I'm anxious to get is my check. You mean to tell me that if I offered you fame, fortune, glamour, you'd turn it down? Oh, yes. Mm hmm. You wouldn't be interested in the screen test? No, I wouldn't, Mr. Tolliver. Let me see your profile. Turn around. Walk a little. Walk. Yes, indeed. If I'm any judge at all. Young lady, I think you've got what it takes to make an actress. Have you ever had any acting experience? Yes, I had a job at the night skating ice. But we got fired last night because... Because I really can't skate very much. But I can sing. And if you think I have a chance in motion pictures, then I might... Well, I might consent to a screen test. I see. The check's ready? That was very clever, Miss McKay. And it almost worked. But I agree. You absolutely you don't want a job in moving pictures? I do, Mr. Tolliver. I was only kidding. You're not interested in this sort of work? I am. Indeed I am. I don't believe you should be forced to do it. - Oh, Mr. Tolliver. - Bye, bye. - Very interesting girl. - Yes, Mr. Tolliver. - Quite a personality, too. - Oh, yes, indeed, Mr. Tolliver. - Certain eagerness, which I like. - Yes, Mr. Tolliver. - What was her name again? - Mary McKay. You may got a stock contract, Effie, for Mary McKay. Usual starting salary and the usual options. Yes, Mr. Tolliver. - But we haven't got her address. - She'll be back. Come in, Miss McKay. Sit down, my dear. We'll have your contract ready For you in just a minute. Hey, you know, it's getting late. How long does it take to buy a dress anyway? Oh, well, you know how dames are. They get in one of those shops and takes a tow car to get them out. What's she using for money, though? As far as I know, she didn't have any with her. She's married now. She's probably charging. Larry, Eddie, look! - Read it. - What's it? Read. What's? A contract with Monarch Studio. - $75 a week to start. - Yeah. Seven year options going up to. It's a lie. There ain't that much dough in the world. Well, how do you like that? My wife are movie actress. - Larry, aren't you glad? - Oh, yeah, I guess so. I mean, it's all so sudden. I got to give me a chance to get my bearings here. - Well, I only did it because I wanted. - That's just what I'm getting at. Because why? Suppose I wouldn't be a burden to you. Look, now you can go ahead with your follies. Well, what makes you think you're a burden? Larry, how much money have we got left? Well, not much. There, you see? Now, I will be able to help. We can live on 40 of that 75. Then we'll be able to save something, and then you can have whatever... and then you can have whatever you need. Darling, it's not only for me, it's our money. Married people are supposed to share. Who's married? You two can't kid me. Says right here, not only she ain't married, but she can't do it unless the studio says okay. What's this? Wait a minute. I'm going to read this. What? Right here. "with his consent." I didn't even read it. All I saw was $75 a week. Look, darling, just skip it. Tomorrow I'll see them, we'll call the whole thing off. No, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. They're pretty smart guys, these movie people, and then all of a sudden, a little girl comes along and outsmarts. No, no, you just tell them nothing. I think it's a swell idea. You getting to be a big shot, too. - Do you, Larry? - Well, yeah. I'd be an awful heel if I tried to stand in your way. Look, honey, I not only think this is okay, I think it's marvelous. - Oh, I'm so glad. Larry. - Yeah. It's a pretty good idea you're getting married to me, wouldn't it? - It was a wonderful idea. - It brought you luck. - It brought me you. - And it brought you a job. - Larry, your face all of a sudden... - No, it's just a sudden kind of face. It's like nothing on it. - Are you happy? - What else could I be? In one day, I signed two contracts with a studio and with a husband. Oh, darling, you know which job I love the best, don't you? Hey, my wife's run out on me. I get up and she's taking a powder. You caught her just in time. - Hey, wife. - Hey, yourself, you big tip. Well, how about collaborating on some breakfast? I'll juggle the eggs, Eddie, and burn the toast. You weaken the coffee, huh? I've already made the coffee, and it's not weak. If you want a breakfast, you come in here and get it. You, too, Eddie. - Oh, boy, breakfast. - Look at the worms, little early bird. Hey, why are you going this hour in the morning? Pardon me for finding you, but I'm about to become a poor working girl. Oh, yeah? In 30 minutes I've got to press these ruby lips against the famous puss of Melvin Rodney. No fooling. Isn't it wonderful of the studio to give me Rodney just for a test? I sell more than he deserves. Much too good for him. Thank you, my dear public. If this test is good and I get the part, I'll really be starting to go places. - Can I go long? - You'll be leading the way, darling. That's way wife to talk to her husband. Say, if you two Boy Scouts want to do your good deed for today, you might run over the scene with me. - Do you mind? - No. Look, darling, you take Frank that's Rodney's part. And Eddie, you be Lady Hilda. She's, you know, very high class. Oh, just my type. Look, darling, start up here at the top of the page where Lady Hilda comes in and catches Frank kissing Alice. Alice is me. You started. All right, Frank. Darling, darling, darling, I love you. All right, kisses her. We'll skip the kiss. Come on, Lady Hilda, that's where you come in. - Oh, me? - Yeah, right there. Oh, dear, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. Pray forgive me. Slobs. That? It says Sobs. Idiot. She sobs. Come on, give out with the sob. Very good. Please don't go, Lady Hilda. The time has come for us to speak the truth to each other. You tell her, Frank. Tell her what you've just told me. What? Tell her what you've just told me. "Tell her what you just told me". I love her. Hilda. I love her. No, no. I can't bear it. Oh, you two would better go back on ice. - You're great help. - Fired again. I was just getting my teeth into Lady Hilda. Oh, now it's too late. I have to take a cab. Hold your horse. I'll drive you over to the factory. - You got the key to the car, Eddie? - Yeah, I got right here. Just a minute, Dopey. That's my coat. Oh? Yeah! Where's mine? Does the shopper have to wear a tie He can go with his necklace. No, just as he is. That's the only reason I hired him. Because that beautiful. In a hurry darling. Okay. Say, I'm going to do the shopping while I'm out. What'd you like to have for dinner, Lady Hilda? Well, I'll have some terrafin, a bird under glass, a cold bottle. I got it. Corned beef and cabbage and beer. Wait, Miss McKay. I don't know. I don't know. - No, no, no. - No, no, no. Give me something simple human and honest. But it must be glamorous. Different. Startling. If that's not too tall in order for you. No, sir. Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Why women like to market gets me. I almost had to punch that vegetable guy on the nose. Will you tell me why the price of tomatoes should have gone up? I can't imagine since we quit working. Oh, that's a very funny joke. I decided on meatloaf for tonight and the babe likes it, too so. What are you all dressed up for? Larry, I hope you're going to take this in the right way. Take what? You better put them groceries down. Prices being what they are. But why? Kid, I'm blowing. I'm going back east. Over my dead body. I gotta go, Larry. - When you gotta go... - Oh, wait a minute. You're kidding? Why are you running out on me? Well, what's it for me to do around here? You're working on your folly stuff. Mary's got a job in pictures. I just sit around and twiddle my thumbs. Look, I got muscles in them like sandals from this last month. Just twiddling. Eddie, we've been together a lot of years. I figured it'd stay that way as long as they could freeze ice and we could skate on it. Well, they're still freezing ice, pal. Only we ain't skating on it. Well, we're planning for the future, Eddie. We're building big things. That's what you're doing. You don't need me for that. Eight years. It's been hall and Burgess. That's a big chunk out of a guy's lifetime. Well, you just can't cancel the whole thing out by saying, well, it's been nice up to now, but now it ain't so nice. I got other plans. But I ain't needed in this setup, kid. I'm just a fifth wheel. Well, what's it for me to do? - You're my partner. - Not anymore. Now I'm just a guy with whom you discuss the price of tomatoes. Hall without Burgess. Well, that just don't taste right in my mouth. Don't take it that way, Larry. You do all right without me. Yeah, yeah, sure. Guy don't die when he loses his right arm. He just learns how to do without it, that's all. Well, so long. Good luck, Eddie. - Say goodbye to Mary for me. - Yeah! Yeah! Is that you, Mary? I'm not sure. Make up your mind. Besides, you're late. Yes, I know. We had to work overtime. I couldn't get to a telephone. I cooked dinner three times. Come on in and get it. - Larry? - Yeah? You come in here, will you, just for a minute? Meatloaf's cremated and the spuds are... - What's the idea? - I got the part of Alice. They're talking of building it up and it may even go to be the lead. They said I needed glamour, so they gave it to me. One of the reasons I married is because I thought you had glamour. Well, not for pictures. So they said. They've changed my name too. I changed your name too? What is this, a game? Well, darling, they said for pictures that Mary McKay was kind of... well, anyway, they're calling me Sandra Lee. I think it's more high class. Larry, don't you like me this way? Look, I'm hungry. I don't react good in an empty stomach. Now, come on. We'll talk about it more after dinner. - You want me to help, dear? - It's all done. You just sit down. What is this? Eddie's night off? Eddie's night off? His week off. As a matter of fact, he's off for good. He said to say goodbye to you. - Why did he go? - His thumbs got muscle bound. - His what? - Well, let's drop it. He's gone. Get together again sometime, maybe. But to go suddenly like that, I just can't understand. Oh, drop it, will you? What's the matter? You're not eating. I don't blame you. The food's rotten. Here, eat your spinach. It'll build you up. Even more than the studio does. Thanks. I'm really not very hungry. - I think I'll just have some coffee. - No. Well, I'll get it for you. I cook my brains out and she settles for coffee. Maybe a great artist's temperament has to be nursed along, I suppose. Coffee coming up. Landmark. Get back. Excuse me, please. Henry the Trocadero. Get back! Go on! Get back! Get back! The star that shine above this night on ecstasy... I thought you'd be asleep, darling. But I'm glad you waited up for me. - Thought you were coming home early. - Oh, I couldn't. Oh, we were celebrating. Oh, I had such fun. Oh, no, Larry, don't be mad at me. Really. You mustn't be angry with me because I've got terrific news for... Aren't you a little not quite yourself? If you mean I'm tight, you're wrong. Because I'm cockeyed. You know what one drink does to me. Well, I've had more than one. Come on over here tonight. I want to talk to you. Larry, they're going to tear up my contract and give me a new one with so much more money that we're going to have to have to get a truck to carry to the bank for us. And they're going to put me in another picture right away. And they're going to put my name on the billboard above the title. Do you know what that means? Above? Yeah, I guess I know what that means. It means I'm going to be a star. A star, darling, you see that? Well, they lent me that for the preview. But after this, I'm going to own all my nice clothes. Oh, darling, isn't it bewildering? Yeah, I guess it is. We're going to have everything. I've got it all planned. I'm going to build you the biggest ice rink in the whole world. I'm going to get you the most beautiful costumes, and the biggest orchestra, and everything... your heart desires. How does that sound to you? Good enough. Of course, I'll sort of miss not having to cook anymore. That's silly. Suppose you'll be getting your own maid now. I won't be able to help you dress. And now it won't even be necessary for me to put on the follies. You'll be making enough dough for both of us. Oh, no! No. We must have your follies. Both of us rich, successful, way up on top. Hey, remember that night we got fired? The necklace of stars you promised me? Never got around to giving it to you, did I? I'm not... Oh, Larry. Ice water, please. Oh, I'm just not a drinking woman. Larry? "Men who live on women are called a nasty name. I wouldn't always be such a one. My follies are said and successful, and we're equal in all things. And we can come together again until then I came. Just local. I'm there in my numbers, Mort. I'm going to tell stories on ice. Stories especially written for singers and dancers and skaters. Now, if you've ever seen anything like those, I'll get off my skates and I'll take up a course in dishwasher or bottle blowing or something. - All right, tell me I'm crazy. - You are crazy. Like Ziegfeld was crazy. What, you mean you like it? Who wouldn't like it? When do you want to start rehearsing? I know just the people I want, I can get them right away. You get me a ring, we can start Monday. Okay. Now, for costumes, scenery, music. I got to lay down deposits. - Have you got any money? - Money? What are you talking about? It'll take plenty to put on the show. Well, if I had any money, the only reason I'd be here is to leave a couple of passes. You mean to say you're broke? You see that desk, those chairs? I hope they don't come for them before Monday because I'm expecting a client Saturday who don't like to sit on the floor. Okay, Mort. Is that Samson office still in this building? Is there a fire someplace, Larry? Well, you just said you don't have any dough. But I still got telephone numbers. My friend, sit down and be calm. While there's suckers, there's hope. Now, listen, sweetheart, that booking you got us in Paul River, they ain't got a rake, they got an ice cube. - Quiet. - How the thumbs work out, pal? Larry! Oh, why don't you let a guy know? Oh, I guess I didn't deserve it, ratting on you the way I did. Well, come on, say something before I cry like a hungry orphan. - Shut up. How are you? - Fine. What's the difference? How are you? How is Mary? - Is she with you? - I'm fine. Mary's fine. She's right in the middle of a picture, I know. Well, what are your plans? What do you say we... What do you say I go out and leave your boys alone? Oh, I'm sorry. Honey. I want you to meet Kitty Sherman. This is Larry Hall. - Hello. - Hello. Kitty and me are skating together. - I told you about him, remember? - Will you please shut up? I'm trying to talk. Oh. Hello, Mr. Pearson. Listen, Mr. Pearson, I've got a marvelous proposition for you. It's an ice skating show. It's the most sensational thing I've ever run up against. I can't begin to tell you. Nothing like it's ever even been attempted before. Well, maybe about 50 grand. Yes. Okay, Mr. Pearson. - All right, what was it? - Come. What was it? He's been speculating in the stock market. Somebody gave him a tip. You heard me. I asked him for 50 grand. He said if it's good, he'll put up the dough. - Eddie! - Boy! Oh boy! Mort, if you was a dame, I'd kiss you. Say, if I was a dame, I wouldn't be losing my frenetic. I'm going to send telegram to Mary. Hey, have pity on my bill. There's a telegraph office. Right down the stairs. Okay. All right, you two kids are in the show. Get a hold of the ship. Said brothers and Oscar Johnson. I'll be right back. Happy days. On here again. Hey, what's the matter with this phone? It's dead. You know that telephone company, they got a heart like an iceberg. How much could three months bill amount to? Would they go out of business because I couldn't pay? No, but in spite of that, they deliberately cut off my service. - Then who was you talking to? - Myself. Pretty convincing, wasn't I? - Say, I've hung around actors so long... - Why, you low down rat? - Raising that kid's hopes that's... - Now, listen, Eddie. He's got a terrific idea. I couldn't let it get away from me, could I? I got obligations. I'll get that go. Don't worry. A rink to rehearse. I'll get one if I have to make it with my old lady's ice box. Then I'll begin scouting around. I'll get that backing by telephone, telegraph or machine gun. Hey. Look at that house. And we turned away a thousand people. What's matter with that fire department anyway? Why can't we put seats in the aisles? Nobody's going to walk out during this show. All right, floodlight the whole arena. Bring up your lights full for Shipstead and Johnson. That's his stuff. Hold it on them now. All right, raise your branks. Fly your wigwams, blot out your sides. And send up a T-bone steak, medium rare. Now, just take it easy when we get another set. - Okay, boys, bring it up. Another set. - Bring script over here. - Yes, sir. - We're right over here. Especially delivery letter just come for you, Miss Lee. Oh, thank you. No, no, you stay out there. Leave me alone for a little while, will you? Yes, ma'am. "We open in New York on Thanksgiving day. So, here we are, darling, both of us on top, and there isn't anything in the world that can keep us apart from now on, all my love, Larry. - Alice? - Yes, Miss Lee. I've got see Mr. Talver right away. What's his number? 365. - Three, six... Yes? - May I come in? Oh, Doug, I was just calling you. Yes, well, I just came down to the set to tell you... You got to do something for me. Now, you know I don't ask favors as a rule, but this you must do. You must fix it up for me. I want to go to New York. My dear, if you'll just listen... But I don't want this. And I want you to let me go, that's all. I want to be there next month, and I have a particular reason. But... No, that's not you saw giving that dough, look, you can't stop me. The studio can't stop me. I want to go to New York. Of course you're going to New York. You mean I'm going to New York? That's what I've been trying to tell you. The studio is planning a big personal appearance for the opening of your picture. - When? - Next month, thanksgiving Day. Oh, but that's the same Day, it doesn't matter. Doug, I was so happy. See here, why are you so anxious to go to New York? Well, to see the Statue of Liberty. I've never seen it. I break my neck trying to get to the airport in time and all I get is a flash of her left profile. That's the side that photographs best or something. What are you acting up for? Wasn't there a big crowd out there? You said yourself you couldn't get close to her at her fault. Well, she could at least have yelled at me. Listen, pal, why don't you go lay your head on the ice outside and cool off? You'll see her planning. I'm anxious to be with her, that's all. Hey, skater, they want you. They're hearsing outside, not in here. I'll break a leg, friend, but worry. We're in the dough, kid. We're doing all right. Hello? Who is this? I'd like to speak to Mr. Larry hall, please. Tell him it's someone who used to skate with him. Listen, sister, he's got all the skaters he needs. What kind of brains have you got anyway, sweetheart? He's opening tonight and here you are asking him fora job a couple of hours before try again next to you when he's doing a new show. Hey, who is that? Oh, some screw board Dame. Wants you to stop everything and put her in the show. Says she used to skate with you. Give me hello, Mary? Mary... Well, hold on a minute. Come on, beat it. - What? - Go on. Go on, beat it. How did I know is he? Mary. What? At last. I'm so sorry about this morning. But you saw how it was. Mr. Tolliver thought I was crazy. I cried all the way to the hotel. Well, I haven't been feeling so hot myself, but that's all right. Now, look, I gotta see you. Hi. You come over here, right? Huh? I can't because I'm giving a tea for the press. At least they call it a tea. Look, darling, can't you come over here? Can I have tea with the press? No. Can't you sneak away and meet me for dinner? Oh, darling, I can't, I've got to have dinner with the gang. Look, I don't care what happens. I don't care if they shoot me. - I'll get away somehow. - That's a baby. Now, look, all right, meet me at the you know, the 59th street entrance at the park in an hour. And go easy on the lipstick because you're going to get kissed. Hi, officer. Is that against the law? Well, I don't rightly remember. I'd run over and ask the sergeant. But don't go away. - Wait on that bench hut over there. - Okay. I may have to make a pinch. How about meeting after our shows so we can tell each other how good we are? Might even buy you a drink, maybe. No, I can't. They're giving me a big dinner after that opening tonight. You know, a big crowd and I got a broadcast and... Oh, well, all right. But tomorrow night you come to see my follies, huh? If you don't like them, I promise to punch you right in the there. What's the matter? Larry, I'm flying back to the coast tomorrow. I have to start a new picture right away. You mean that after all these months, all we get is a half an hour together on a park bench? Darling, I can't refuse to go back. Look, I'll be back here in six weeks. I started personal appearance to in Philadelphia then. That time, I sure, will be in Chicago. Now, wait a minute. Let's think it over. It's Philadelphia and Atlantic City and back to New York and then... Boston. There must be some way we can get together. We can't. It's no go. It doesn't make sense. What kind of a marriage is this anyway? You here, me there. Maybe if we try real hard, we'll get together fora half an hour half a dozen years from now. Not Larry, you're exaggerating. There must be some way. Seemed pretty simple when we were both nothing, didn't it? Didn't it? Yeah, we had it all figured out. Worked toward a happy ending. Will be a happy ending. There must be. We said when we were stars we'd hold on to each other. But we forgot one thing. Forgot one thing. - We didn't stop to study our astronomy. - Oh, Larry. Because if we had if we had, we'd have found out that stars are a million miles apart. They never touch. They live away from each other, cold and lonely... like we'll have to do. That may be astronomy, but it's not us. I won't have it that way. What are you going to do about it? - What can you do about it? - No. Anything. Something. - I'll arrange it with the studio. - Kidding yourself? You're kidding yourself, just like I've been kidding myself. I thought about this a long time ago, but I threw it out of my mind. I said to myself, we love each other, so it'll work out somehow. Well, it won't work out. It's getting late. Come on, let's go. The sergeant said it wasn't against the law unless they passed a new one overnight. They sometimes do that in this town. Well, he's wrong, officer. It was against the law. What we've done to each other is against every law of human nature. Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to bring you the brightest star of the cinema heavens, Sandra Lee. Following the triumphant premiere of her new motion picture, The Lady of Chance. Miss Lee is being fated tonight at a banquet given in her honor, during which she will personally address you. We take you now to the Trayonon room of the Hotel Francois. My friends, you may want to know the explanation of this cake. Well, it's not a birthday cake, and yet, in a way, it is. It's the birthday of Sandra Lee. And this cake symbolizes her first year in pictures. The story of Sandra Lee is the story of Cinderella. For in one short year, this girl has risen from nothing to become one of the most successful and beloved personalities in the entire picture industry. But I know you're all very anxious to hear from our star herself. So, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to present to you our Hollywood Cinderella, Miss Sandra Lee. My dear friend, as I stand here, it all seems so unreal. You've all heard Mr. Tolliver say that Sandra Lee is another Cinderella, a Hollywood Cinderella. And you know what happened to Cinderella when the clock struck twelve? Her lovely clothes turned into a plain pinafore, her coach into a pumpkin and she ran back home. When I was a little girl, I used to cry at that part of the story. But I don't anymore. Because... Do you know, I've learned something? I've learned that she was glad to go home. I've learned that all the dancing, the music, the beautiful clothes and jewels were fun for a little while, but they didn't really mean a thing. I've learned that glass slippers are uncomfortable for everyday wear. And I don't really believe Cinderella loved the prince at the ball. But waiting for her at her own fireside was the man who really mattered. I'm so grateful to all of you, but I can't go on any longer. I'm not Sandra Lee. I never have been. Not for one little minute. Sandra Lee is as unreal, as untrue as Cinderella. I'm a woman in love with her husband and I want to make a home for him. A place to be happy. - Yeah! Mary! Come, come, my dear. You're nervous. - You can't mean what you're saying. - I mean every word of it. So please, please forget Sandra Lee. She was just a dream. And now she says, God bless you... And goodbye. Hey, pal. Pal. Hey, pal. Hey, did you hear Mary at the radio? Yeah. Yeah, and I gotta get to her and help me find my shoe, will you? - Okay. Which one? - Any shoe. Any shoe. Boy, let me tell you something. I don't deserve what she did for me tonight. You know that, don't you? Well, no guy deserves a really nice girl. Funny how we get them all the same. Hey, what'd you do with that shoe? Eat it. Yeah? Yeah. It's a little trick I learned when I was a polar explorer. You roll it up in breadcrumbs and then heat it over a slow fire. Come on, Eddie, get my shoe, will you? Why do you need two shoes anyway? Who do you think you are, Adolf, mind you. Where are you going? I'm just going to bed. Then you'll need this. Mr. Tolliver. This is my husband, Larry Hall. - Oh, how do you do? - How do you do, sir? And look here, Mr. Hall, we want to talk to you about... - Did you say Larry Hall? - Oh, yes. The man who... Produced The Ice Follies. Mr. Tolliver. Conceived, assembled, directed, everything. Well, well, well. Look here, young man. Oh, but he doesn't want a job in motion pictures, does? Oh, no. What is it? Does he feel superior to that kind of work? Perhaps he does. I should imagine if a man were given an opportunity to produce moving pictures, he'd be very anxious to accept it. All he's anxious for is to get his wife back. You mean to tell me if I offered him fame and fortune. He turned them all down. - No! - Oh, yes. That's incredible. That's incredible. With his ability and his brains, he might make a great career for himself. But he doesn't want that dough. Well, what is this? Somebody's crazy. Don't look at me. Well, my dear, I think this is going to work again. Sit down. Sit down. Mr. Hall, your wife and I will have your contract arrange in just a moment. Now, take it easy, Larry. Don't get excited. Excited? I know, don't get excited. Who's excited? Who's there? I'm not excited. It fits! It fits. It fits. We found the boat that fits the shoe - Spread the news about - It fits - stand right up and shout - It fits Beyond any shadow of a doubt - It fits! - It fits! Be quiet. Darling, you know I love you, but I should have made my entrance on skates. Honey, you know I love you. And that's why you didn't make your entrance on skates. Darling, where's my close up? Out. - What you think about, honey? - It's lovely. It's beautiful. - But it could have been better if with... - With your close-up? - No. With me on skates. - Oh, yeah. Doug. I'm think in my next picture I'm skate, don't you. No, no dear. Mary, I have a terrific idea. In your next picture why you don't skate? - Now Mary, would you... - Quiet. Stars that shine above this night of ecstasy It may be as old as the hill, but it's all wonderfully Refreshingly That was fun. Yes, sir, that's fun. You know, I still think I'd skate my next picture. Shure. What? Sorry mister. The show is off. Subtitles: Kilo
