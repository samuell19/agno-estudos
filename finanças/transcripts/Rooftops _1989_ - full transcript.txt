She was leaving, Jimmy. Don't rush off so soon, Amber. You're looking good, baby. Don't touch me, you little piece of prison shit. Mom, let's go. She ain't going nowhere.

Yo, Willy, check it out-- LOBO: Shut up. I tried to tell me, but you-- you didn't want to listen. And I'm telling you this is my place. T-- T-- T, come on. Don't be unreasonable. This is a big place in a prime location. Not big enough. Think of the business that we can do here. I got no business with you. Well, I really hate to see you have to leave. I'm not. Unfortunately, you give me no choice. Show him the door. [RATTLING] Fucking asshole! Everybody home! What are you doing here? Look, I can't talk to you right now.

Well, you better make sure he stays out of the way. What was he doing here? Living up in the water tower like a bat or rat or something. Yo, T, my main man, what's going on? - Nothing. - Hey, listen.

[SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, come on, T. What is this? [SPEAKING SPANISH],, a Latin shit. No, no, no, I mean this. This is what I was trying to tell you about. It's, uh-- hey, Ote, what do you call this dance? Capoeira. Yeah, capoeira. See that wall? I painted that. It's nice. What's it mean, capoeira? The slaves in Brazil, hundreds of years ago, they need something to protect themselves but they were being watched all the time, so they came up with this. They made it look like a dance, so they're masters wouldn't know what they were doing. It's like combat, but better. Don't be fooled by the dance music, man. These guys, they'll kick your head off. Down-- the jumbos, man. That's all I got. Four, four, two, four, five. - Those jumbos. - There's my bread. This is all I got, man. I want my stuff. Come on. One, two, three. --what's going on, man. - Yo, mira, mira, mira. - I want my stuff. [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Let go of my stuff. Man, I spend all this money. What the hell?

Don't worry about it, Squeak. Don't worry about it? Look at this mess, man. Leave me alone. But, T, look at this place. [YELLS] Get out of here! SQUEAK: Damn it, T. Look at that shit. Goddamn, Lobo. Shut up. SQUEAK: Jesus, T. SQUEAK: Jesus, T. They're all set-up, Lieutenant, like they've been in business for months. Same set-up? Yeah, same old shit. Lobo's the man down here now. Not if I can help it. Not a bad day. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] The hours are long, but you get used to it. Hungry? If you got something on your mind, let's have it. Look, did you have to kick him out? Listen. If you got some sort of attachment to that kid and it's going to interfere with your work, this arrangement ends right now. Mira. Hey, I'm talking to you. You got something going with this kid? That's good. Because he's a nobody and I don't want my cousin hanging out with nobodies. I'm glad that we've got this chance to help out your family-- our family. But don't ever again question what I do. Understand? Yeah. Good. SQUEAK: This some serious shit, man. Oh, the best thing T could do was to get his ass out of there and move on. You don't get it, do you? His whole life been moving on, man. Ain't no goddamn thing we could do for him anyway. OFFICER RIVERA: Hey, kid. I told you before, knock it off. Not a good idea right now. Stay down and shut up. Enjoy the show. Handcuff him if he gives you any more trouble. Get them inside and hold. Come on. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Jesus, please. Get out. Get out right now. Come on, get your ass-- hurry up. [WHISTLING] Dump it. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] No, put it down. Where you going? - All right, all right. Take it easy. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Now don't tell me. New York's finest, right? Yeah. Take it easy down there. That's not a gun in my pocket. I'm just happy to see you. OFFICER: Police, don't move. Hey, what's going on? They flushed it. Dammit! Take him in any way. We'll question him as long as we can. Let's go, kid. Hey, now watch the hair, all right? --that's the shit. Yeah, I know. MAN: Got Chinese yesterday. Meet you at Tony's. All right, let's go. Low bridge, coming through. Easy on the suit. My mom just pressed it. OFFICER: Needs to look for it. MAN: Yeah. All right, in. All right. [POLICE SIREN WARRING] Mira, mira. [SPEAKING SPANISH] She was here to see me. See what she knows. All right. Lobo's like a bad disease, man. You let him get too close and he'll infect you. It's not like I invited him to move in. He doesn't need an invite, not for your place or anybody else's. If you help me out now and then, maybe we could find the cure. [CHUCKLES] Get out of here. You gonna let him walk? He's not involved in this shit. He just happened to live here. Yeah, maybe he's a runaway. Kids don't run away from one home to build another on a rooftop without good reason. [LAUGHS] Like what? Their parents wouldn't let them us the car? Like parents who can't care or don't want to care for their kid, so they throw their kid out. If you're that kid, where do you go? I wanna talk, that's all. Get out of here. Listen, I just want to tell you that Lobo thinks that you set up the bust. I just want to talk with you. T, dammit! You know, you and your scumbag friend, Lobo, got a bad fucking habit inviting themselves in other people's homes. Look asshole. I'm just trying to keep you from getting hurt. Hey, you worry about yourself, asshole. Nobody's going to get hurt as much as you are. Look, Lobo thinks you set up the bust. It's not my style, not that it breaks my heart either. Yeah, well, you should get out of here. No, you should get out of here. You better go back to work, so you can support your habit. I got no habit. Oh, no? Then what do you do it for then? It's for my family who's got bills coming out of their ears after my father's heart attack. Mhm, break out the violins and handkerchiefs. Fuck you! You wouldn't know about family, would you? I know there are other ways than working for Lobo. Oh, yeah, what? Waiting on tables for 3.75 an hour ain't gonna pay the bills. Wouldn't that be easier on your father's heart condition than you getting busted? If you got all the answers, how come you're living here? Look, just go, OK? Just leave me alone. Go on. And stay away from Lobo. Yeah, you too. And don't worry about me. The damn door is stuck. T: You gotta push on it. ELANA: I Did. You try it. Watch out. What the hell? [LOUD BANG AND GLASS SHATTERING] [MAN LAUGHING] Come on! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING, FIRE CRACKLING] Just give me your hand. Oh, my god. Take it easy, we'll get down. That's it. [SCREAMS] I got you.

Nice-- My other foot-- We'll go nice and slow like this. Don't be-- [SCREAMS] T, are you OK? [GROANS] ELANA: Ah! Yeah. It's OK. Here we go. ELANA: I'm scared. I'm scared. You're fine. Just stay calm. OK. Hold on tight. Here we go. - [SCREAMS] I got you. Hold on. Hold on, I got you. Just hold on to me. That's it. Here we go. Just keep going, just like this. OK. Feel the pole with your feet. You're almost down. That's it. That's it. Good. You're safe. You're fine. You're down. There you go. [COUGHING] Damn, you OK? T, what happened? It was Lobo, wasn't it? Fucking scumbag! AMBER: Oh god! ELANA: Is there someplace we can take him? We'll get him! Look, we got to take him-- - Leave him alone! - Why? He's in trouble with Lobo. You were working for Lobo! You were working for Lobo? We have to get that scumbag! Don't be a fool, Squeak! [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING, CLAPPING AND CHEERING] Move out. Just take a seat. This is an exhibition. You want to combat, go back to the street. What's the matter? Afraid I might make you look bad? Come on. Go home while you're still able. Shit, let's see how bad you are. Sloppy, man. You're drunk. [GROANS] CAPOEIRA INSTRUCTOR: Too much anger. I could have broken your back. Go to hell. CAPOEIRA INSTRUCTOR: You need control, balance. Together, not alone. You must know your enemy. Get him into your rhythm. Head up. Come on. You rush in, I'll take your head off. Wait for him to come to you, then strike. Balance. Too much. Come on, try it. Good. Not bad. Now try again. Oh, yeah. [CLAPS] [SCREAMS] You said he had nothing going with that bum and you're in his water tower. [SPEAKING SPANISH],, he saved my ass during the bust. While he was burning mine. No, he didn't-- Are you dating him? No. Are you? No. You better not be. I better not see you with him again. - Santiago. - Shut up. Just shut up! Forth and Avenue C at 9:00 in the morning. And remember what I said. [MUSIC PLAYING] SQUEAK: Damn. Aye, yo, that's why he should have moved on. Shut up, man. KADIM: Can't fuck with Lobo. T? T? Give it up, man. Come and get it, cockroach. Hey, give him the coat, man. Uh-huh, take it, big man. Come on, take it. Here it is. [LAUGHS] Nah, nah, go ahead. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Go ahead, take that coat, bad ass. You didn't say, "may I?" Now get the fuck outta here. Come on, Squeak. [LAUGHS] Motherfucker! Not so fast, cockroach. We gotta talk. [GASPS] SQUEAK: No, don't let me go. You get me up. [LAUGHING] Get me up. Come on, scumbags. Get me up, please. I swear. Scumbags, get me up. Yo, B. How's the weather down there? Get me up! Don't! Want a drag? Want a drag? Son of a bitch. No, you better not. SQUEAK: No. It's bad for your health. I don't know where T is. Let me fucking go! I'm-- I'm going to ask you one more time, cockroach. SQUEAK: Shit, help!

No. My father was given this after working five years for an oil company. He worked offshore on the drilling rigs. Southern Offshore, Thomas Eastwood, 1970, Louisiana. Thomas Eastwood? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. ELANA: Mhm, your parents. Yes, Thomas and Delores. ELANA: Where are they? [SCOFFS] Um, one night when I was about six years old, they were both drunk and arguing and, uh, he threw her out of the house. He wouldn't let her come back in. He wouldn't let me let her in. And, uh, it was raining and she tried to climb a metal rain gutter up to the open window on the second floor. And she nearly made it but, uh, she slipped and grabbed out and touched an electrical wire. And a couple months later, when I was at school, my father hung himself in our garage. Oh, T, I'm sorry. Look, no more questions. OK. T: It was a busted-up water tower, you know, but I made it mine. That bastard. Stay away from Lobo, T. I'm through with him. I'm going to tell him. Sengos, Angelo, A. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] I warned your, cockroach. Come here. Get off of my rooftop. Oh, what's up, B? You dissing me, homeboy. Don't fuck around unless you plan to use that.

LOBO: You're done, cockroach. Run, but you can't hide. You hear me? No way out. [PANTING] Got you now. T: Squeak! Shit. Get away. Go on. The gun was empty, man. I didn't do anything! You were gonna pull a gun on me? Put me down! You're gonna dis me? Let me go! Just put me down, will you? Can't let you get away with that. No, cockroach. That was a big mistake. Let me go! I'll leave you alone. Your last mistake. No, no, no! The last time you point a gun at me. No! [SCREAMS] [PANTING] [TIRES SCREECHING] God! Call for an ambulance. Did anybody see what happened to him? Oh, no. [SOBBING] [POLICE RADIOS] [CHATTER] [SOBBING] No matter what I say or you say, you know he's going to go after Lobo. And when he does, he shouldn't go alone.
