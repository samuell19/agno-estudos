Once upon a time in a faraway land known as the 1980s, there was a lovely, smart, funny American girl named Donna who moved to England, where she fell in love with a handsome Frenchman named Henrique. They had a perfect child whom they called Eloise, and all was well until one day Henrique decided, as we say in England, to fuck the babysitter. And so dear Donna returned to her charming hometown of Indianapolis, where she met another man who was... Well, he was Bill. And Donna had two more children, Alice and Paul. For half the year, Eloise would come to stay with them and enjoy all the delights of Midwestern life: the motor speedway, the Putt-Putt, and of course the mall. ♪ That's Frosty the Snowman ♪ ♪ He's a jolly, happy soul... ♪ Okay, everyone, say "jingle." Jingle! Okay, everybody, hats and sweaters off. Let's see that Easter flair. All right, you heard your mother. He is risen. Let's go! Uh, wh-what's happening? Well, I paid for three pictures, so we're moving on to Easter. Hey, big guy, do you mind stepping aside for these next ones? Yeah, let's go. Go get yourself a potato. Extra bacon bits. You earned it. Let's go. He's not allowed to eat in his suit. Oh, just roll with it. Come here, Paulie. - Ooh, Mom, can we be hugging in the picture? - Yes. Oh, let's flex. - Uh, yes to hugging, no to flexing. - Yes. -Yay! - -Excuse me. We weren't ready. - Come on. I-I'm sorry. There's a lot of people waiting. All right, I will pay for the four-picture package. I can pay for it, Mum. El, no, I'm not gonna allow my 13-year-old daughter to pay for this. - Her dad sent her here with $3,000. - I know. Oh, yeah, but we already decided she's buying us a Jet Ski. Bill. I thought we landed on a hot tub. How about one of those limousines with a hot tub? Let's get a lion. - Let's get a Taco Bell and put it in our backyard. - Yes! Everybody, say... Bunny. Bunny! Great. Okay, red, white and blue. - Quick like bunnies. - Wait. You're forgetting a very important holiday. Give that to your mother. And we'll all say... Surprise! Happy Mother's Day, Mum. Sorry I always have to miss it. This is so nice. Aw. Oh, don't cry. This is supposed to make you happy. I'm sorry. I can't stop it. It's happening. Mom, does Ellie really have to go home tomorrow? Well, honey, she will be back before you even know it. Why can't her dad live here? Because he lives in England, Alice. - I hate England! - Oh. That's reasonable. I'm sorry. Should I take the picture? This isn't gonna get any better, hon. Just take it. Yes, Donna's three children were once thick as thieves. But as they grew, well, they grew apart. Eloise had her father's fortune, and Alice and Paul had their father's Chrysler Sebring. By the year 2022, the family had scattered to the four winds, but there was a glimmer of hope that could perhaps bring them all together once more. I'm speaking of course of a wedding. And that is how our story begins. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Who took the bomp? ♪ ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ ♪ See you later ♪ ♪ See you later. ♪ What the fuck even is this? Hi, sis. Oh, my fucking God, have you seen this invitation? I-I am five minutes away from homiciding someone. - I can't stand her. - I know. I know. I opened mine this morning, and then I just put it down on my kitchen table, I poured kerosene everywhere, and then I just literally burned my own house down. I mean, the invites are gorgeous, but I'm not kidding, I think she spent like $25,000. And they smell like rosemary. I am moving to space. Okay, I'm screaming, and I'm dead. I died of screaming, and now I'm also... I'm stabbing people. I'm just, I'm just randomly stabbing people. - Paul! - Oh, sorry. Okay, give me one second. I'm at work, and I have a patient in a trash can. That sounds fine and normal. Okay, you got nine more minutes, Helen. That's it. There is a maxi pad near my shin. - How does that make you feel, honey? - I want to get out. I want you to let that feeling in but just not act on it. I am gonna add some more trash now. Now, remember, this might feel like I'm heaping garbage on you... ...but it's a gift. Hi. Sorry. Are you going to the wedding? No, I'm not going. Alice, Eloise is our half sister, which means we can half-ass the relationship. Although, she did ask me to be her maid of honor when I was like 17. Oh, my God. You're gonna go, aren't you? She doesn't even want us there. Or maybe she wants us to be her butlers. Whatever. - I'm not going. - Uh-huh. Okay, I really need to go now. Listen, Alice, stay strong, and please tell Mom to stop calling me. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? I seem to be stuck... Ma'am? Coming in. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. No worries. Uh, it's just my face. Uh, okay, let's see. - Let me just... - I just got... I couldn't get... Can you unzip? - Whew. - Sure. I got it. Wait. Oh, okay. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Oh. Hi. - I will pay for this. - Don't worry about it. Are you shopping for a special occasion? Yes, my daughter Eloise is getting married in England. She lives there. My first husband was European. French. Henrique. He's a douche bag. - Oh. Okay. - And my other children from my second marriage... They don't seem to really like me right now. Especially my son Paul. Ever since his father Bill died... Bill was my second husband. - Yeah. - Life's a journey. As for me, well, I guess the, uh... Romantic chapters of my life are over, and I'm-I'm not sure what to do next. - Well... - And I've also developed this totally irrational fear of traveling. I'm so anxious. But my friend Barbara gave me some pot for my flight. - Do you do pot? - Uh, I... Oh, you can't answer that. You're at work, so don't. The point is I haven't had all my children together for a while. I mean, since Bill's funeral. Shall I get you some other options? Yes. Yes. I'll try not to completely destroy them. Wow. ♪ ♪ Can't ignore your mom forever, hon. I absolutely can ignore her forever, actually. I'm very cold and extremely heartless, so... It's very hard to be a parent, Paul.

Uh, reschedule my Friday lunch, and do you want to sit in on my two o'clock? I could really use your input on this one. Yeah. I could squeeze you in. Can we get dinner after this? Only if it's someplace nice. No cheeseburgers. - What if it's a very, very cool food truck? - No. You own this whole company. You are not buying me a cheeseburger, bro. Did you just call me "bro" while we're fucking? I'm sorry. Your Honor. That's better. Say that one more time. - Your Honor. - Oh. Oh, shit. Oh. How much money worth of wine do you think is in this cup? Like, is this $45 worth? You know, sometimes I think that you're actually just using me for my fortune. Oh, my God, no. I'm using you for your dick. - I'm okay with that. - Good. Who was that? Barf. My mom is trying to get me to go to my sister's wedding again. Oh, and you're not gonna go 'cause you're gonna miss me too much? No. My sister's just... We were close for a long time, and I thought she was amazing, but she was just rich. Oh, that sucks. No, not like a cool rich person like you or like Iron Man. - We're basically the same person. - Mm-hmm. But it's different. She's not there for me, you know? Like, literally. She was supposed to come see me last summer. Oh, so she wasn't there for the breakup or the miscarriage? Yeah, whatever. She bailed, chose to stay in London and play cricket and shove fish and chips up her butt. That's not how you eat them. You should go. Or maybe... we should go? What? Give a girl a little warning. Give her some warning next time. Date night. She's kind of up there, you know. Hey, boys. So excited for your big show tonight. Do you know Paul has never seen King Lear? Well, to be fair, I did see Gnomeo & Juliet, by myself, through a series of mix-ups. Oh, we're doing a whole gender thing, so it's actually Queen Lear. Oh, wow. I'm sure it's better than that production of Cats where they made them all dogs. Oh, hey, Dallas. Hi. Dallas, you have to meet Dominic and Paul. They are our best friends, and it is a travesty we haven't introduced you yet. Hi, Dallas. Is it true what they say? Is everything bigger in Texas? Well, hi, boys. Uh... Oh, there's the lights. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Um, I'm not a part of that. I'm just their straight friend. Yeah, we figured. You dress straight. Wait, Dom. What is a Dallas? He's their, you know, extra. - They opened their relationship? - Mm-hmm. I'm shocked. - Oh, Paul, you're so easily shocked. - I am not. Yes. You're shocked every time they reveal a Masked Singer. Okay, well, it's never who you expect it to be. That's the whole point of the show. Paul, I'd love to talk to you about making the trip. Airplane emoji. Where are you? Where are you? Oh. No, that's a knife. ...that she may feel. How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is. To have a thankless child. Why did she send a knife? All right, sir, this is your destination. Please feel free to give me a five-star rating on my pretend Uber account. I will give you six. - ...ty-nine? - No. Yes! You said it. All right, time to face the music. You know, you could come to my place sometime, for the night. You could even ride up front like a real boy. No, the-the way that she's gonna yell at me for being this late is bad enough. I mean, if-if I was out all night, believe me... Yeah, okay. I get it. Never mind. Alice, I'm sorry. I mean, she already knows that I want a separation, but... The baby. Yeah. Okay, I hate you. Go. I hate you, too. See you tomorrow. I'm worried about Preston and Crosby. An open relationship just sounds very messy. Mm, I think that's sort of the point. I thought they were happy. Maybe they just want to share their happiness with someone else. Gosh, Paul, you're so young but so traditional. Well, I think it's nice when two people can really commit to each other for life, you know? Like I thought my parents did. - Maybe they did. - No. No. My mom threw away all my dad's stuff, like, a week after he died, like he never even existed. And she never even talks about him. I still don't think this awkwardness with your mom should stop us from going to London. Hmm? Okay, well, honey, my mom's not the only reason I don't want to go, okay? I also... have to work. And... um, well, I don't like scones. Okay, so scones and open relationships... They're off the table. Wait, do you really wish we had an open relationship? No. No, I don't. Paul, I think you should talk to your mom. You know, maybe she had her reasons for being weird with your dad, you know? Maybe he was whoring around town. You know, really giving it to the ladies at the Fuddruckers. No, no. That's my mom's first husband that cheated on her. But she still has his picture up in her house. Henrique.

I don't think there's a gay on the planet that wants to be miniature, because then you run the risk of an old crone coming along and snatching you up and putting you in her glass menagerie along with her treasures.

Mom was just explaining anal sex to him. Tom, this is, this is my family. I'm the proud father. I would be. Well, it's, uh, it's lovely to meet you all. And, uh, congratulations on the whole, uh, gay shebang. Um, everyone's doing it. Well, I'll see you at the wedding, Eloise. Did he just congratulate you for being gay? - Straight up. - No! Shush. All of you. I'm going to assume that all of your absolutely outrageous behavior tonight can be attributed to jet lag and not some sort of advanced rot occurring in each of your minds. But heed my words. This is my city, these are my people, and furthermore, and most importantly, this is my wedding. And you will not fuck this up for me. So whatever's going on with you tonight, I trust it is out of your systems entirely and from this moment forward, you will behave like a normal family who is here to happily celebrate a loved one's wedding.

And you felt that he loved you unconditionally, and it's so rare to feel loved that way. And I didn't want to destroy that. And I'm sorry about Henrique macking it on that floozy. You know what? It's fine. Well, you deserve to be loved unconditionally, too. I already am. Ayo. Oh. Did my daughter Eloise come? Yes. So are we being released? No. But she left a note for you. A-A note? She wanted me to read it to you. Well, no, we can just read it oursel... Okay, you're gonna do it. "Dear Mum, Alice and Paul, I love you all, but I have changed your RSVPs for tomorrow to no." Huh. "All I've ever wanted was to feel like a part of this family "instead of like a satellite spinning out in space all alone. "I guess I thought maybe my wedding would be a chance to reconnect, "but I see now that maybe we were never really connected. "You have my promise: From here on out, I'll stop trying so hard." Well, that's a real shame, innit? Don't like to see that, do you? Family torn apart and whatnot. ♪ Yeah... ♪ Dennis, hi. Thanks for coming. Thanks for even answering my call. Sorry, Alice, who is Dennis? Dennis is... He... I'm no one. Alice and I used to be friends. Oh, well, thank you very much. - He's cute. - Thank you, Dennis. Hey, I am really sorry. It's okay. My big old, dumb, Midwestern heart will mend somehow. I'll meet a simpler girl, like maybe a lady scarecrow. Do you have those in Kansas? Oh, yeah. Definitely do. That him? Yeah. From his new phone, because Marissa had his old phone, which is why I thought he was coming. And never mind. You don't care. No, no, this is riveting. Please go on. He says Marissa is leaving him, so we can finally be... ...together. Sounds like a real dream come true. Maybe someday you can punch his new mistress at her sister's rehearsal dinner. Circle of life. Thank you again. And I can, um, Cash App you for the bail. Okay. My handle is Dennis underscore Bottoms. S-So sorry. Bottoms? Paul, not now. Come on. Well, we'll always have Paddington. He's a good bear. See you, Alice. Okay, who was that, now? Just a really great guy who genuinely liked me and I completely fucked over. Oh, there she is. I'm doing great. Hey. We're doing great. Come on. Let's get you kids to bed. I'm gonna tuck you in. Donna. Henrique. I wanted to apologize. Oh, really? What for? For leading you on. I didn't mean to ruin your life again. Yeah, you know what, Henrique? I think... I think I'm the one who owes you an apology. I think I should apologize to you for ruining your life. What are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. I was your first love. And I was a kind, good woman who honestly loved you, and you blew that. And ever since then, you've been trying to fill the massive space that I left with money and things and sex, and nothing, nothing has probably ever felt as good or real or safe as having someone who actually cared. And now, you know what, your life is almost over. You got what, 15 years left? One before some X-ray or scan comes back with a dark spot on it and we're staring into the abyss? So I'm sorry. I'm sorry I showed you a glimpse of what life is like when you treat people well, when you hold on to the tiny parcel of love you are given and you say "thank you" instead of throwing it into the street and screaming for more. I'm sorry it was probably never as good for you again. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going in there by myself, because I'm very, very tired. So good night, Henrique. ♪ ♪ Ollie, you're not supposed to see me. It's bad luck. I figured we got all the bad luck out of the way last night. That's not funny. I just... I don't want you to have any regrets. They are your family. I suppose. I've never really belonged to them. Well, you belong with me. And we will have our own family together. I'm just gonna go and make sure everything's set up and tip-top. What color are these? Oh, um, white? They look cream. Isn't that white? Do you think snow and milk are the same color? Yes? No. No, they are not. I've got to go and get replacements for these. It'll only take a minute. Hello. Martha. I ordered 2,000 votives for my wedding, and I believe you sent the wrong color. You see, I ordered white, and I received this. - That looks white to me. - Does it? Does it, Martha? Because I'm pretty sure that's off-white, which literally means "not white." And now I have 2,000 of those candles scattered all over the property where I'm getting married, and it's not gonna be okay! Help me, Martha. You're the only one who can help. Um, wh-why don't I go check in the back and see if we have some white ones. Great. We do have the votives in white. Oh. Oh, well, that's perfect. We have 200 of them. Two hundred? I need 2,000. Martha, I-I have to get out of here. I-I can't breathe. I just... Eloise. Do you know, I was just popping in here to get a card for your wedding gift. Not now, Tom! Splendid. Heading back to America in shame. I finally know how Madonna felt after her Guy Ritchie divorce. I know Eloise said not to come, but what if I went and stood at a distance? - Mom. - No. The police officer read us the whole addendum that stated specifically not to do that. I know. I know. I know. - Ollie. - Eloise is missing. Apparently, she had some sort of meltdown at a candle store and then ran away. I have no idea where she could be. Really? Taco Bell? Yep. Her favorite. Henrique would never let her go to one, so we went constantly when she visited. She used to have all her birthday dinners there. Wasn't as sad as it sounds. Would you guys mind if I went in by myself just for a minute? Can I have a nacho? - Eloise, I don't... - Wait. Before you talk, I get to talk. Alice, I'm sorry about last summer. Paul told me. About Andrew abandoning you after the miscarriage. I promise I had no idea because... I know, because I didn't tell you. And I hated you for it, and it wasn't your fault. There's a little more to it than that, though, too. I... What, El? What is it? Shortly before I was going to come, I found out that I can't have any children. Ever. I tried to get on that plane to come and see you, but I... I just... I couldn't. You know, growing up, compared to you guys, I had this kind of half life. And in my heart, I always thought, "Well, I'll have a family of my own someday, and we will be connected." Truly connected. And in an instant, that dream was gone. I'm really sorry. It wasn't your fault. No, I should have told you. Instead, I just tried to make it up to you by upgrading your room and trying to get you a job and... Yeah, but those are nice things. They're... really nice... things, and I think I can just be an ungrateful dummy sometimes. I haven't even told you the worst part. Ollie doesn't know. He doesn't know that I can't have children, and... I've been lying to him, and he thinks I'm perfect. And I know he won't love me - once he actually knows me because... - That's not... ...it's only a matter of time before Ollie realizes that all of this is just a show and that deep down, I'm just Doritos. Okay, I'm not sure what you mean about the Doritos part 'cause they are a wonderful snack food and let's not be rude to them, but, El, we love you. Maybe too much. We put you on a pedestal, and then we all just feel like such garbage around you that we act terrible to get you to reject us, and I'm only just now realizing what a fun bunch we are. Alice, you deserve happiness. Quit pushing it away. You first. You're my big sister. You have to set a good example. But you do need to tell Ollie about the whole kid thing. Okay. I can go with you. If... if you'd like that. Okay. Before you go, can you get me another gordita? Um, regular or Double Cheesy? Double Cheesy. It's my big day. ♪ ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, gays and theys, your bride. Oh, Eloise. You've never looked more beautiful. Thanks, Mum. I mean, it's just relentlessly unfair you took all the good genes and you left us with the scrap. Well, you did take all the wit. I'm the only one with the correct toe lengths. Why would you throw that in my face before a wedding? Well, I'm just pointing it out. Look at you. Look at you. Look at all of you. You're absolutely perfect. My God. You're the loves of my life. I have spent too much time dwelling on the past instead of thinking of all the good that's in front of us. But no more. And no more not talking to each other. Okay? We need each other. Yes. No more satellites drifting around in space. Come in. Come. Come, come. Come hug. Are we allowed to show this much emotion in the U.K.? Oh, this is so fun and uncomfortable. - Mwah. - I know, but let's just do it for one more minute, okay? Okay. - Bonjour! - Papa. Uh, hello, Henrique. Nice to see you again. Um, I'm... I'm really sorry that I peed on your shoes and punched you in the face. In my defense, you have been a real jerk to my mother on several occasions. I have. It's true. I'm sorry. And what you said to me before is also true, Donna. Merci. Now, Eloise, are we ready to walk down the aisle? ♪ ♪ Ooh. Squeeze up. The Americans are coming. They're coming. - Oh! - - Are you okay? Are you all right? Come on, come on, don't worry... Nice to see you. Okay, okay, please hold it together, hold it together. ♪ ♪ Hello? Yes. I loved the pot gummies. Yeah, you were right. Five was too many. Oh, it was beautiful. Hi. Oh. Wow. Hi. Um, sorry. That I'm on your plane. Um, but don't worry. This time, I'm in coach with the rest of the riffraff and criminals. Mm. The rabbit didn't pay for an upgrade? Um, no, I-I broke up with the rabbit. Oh, no. I'm devastated. Feel like that was sarcastic. Well, uh, maybe I'll come visit you back there, bring my extra dinner roll. Oh, yeah? Not for you to eat. I'm just gonna throw it directly at your dumb, hot face. - I deserve that. - Mm. Watch out. Once upon a time, there was a family again. 80 degrees in December is Los Angeles. I did warn you, Paul. How's that wool sweater treating you? - Well, it doesn't smell great. - But you look great. You guys, I'm so glad we're here. We missed you so much for Thanksgiving. - You really didn't miss much. - Excuse me. Mother, I love you, but you make a very dry turkey. Well, that's what gravy's for. Mom, that's not. It's supposed to be... - Oh! Please, please. - Oh! Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. Hi, little bunny. I cannot believe how quickly the adoption went through. Look at how elegant this baby is. Like, this is a classy baby. And I bet she doesn't even poop. She pooped all over the plane. We briefly had to touch down in St. Louis. No, you don't poop. Give her here. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Look how perfect she is. I just know if I have a baby, it's gonna be one of the sloppy ones. Nonsense. It'll be a Bottoms. That's very noble. Ho, ho, ho. Ah! I can't believe you did it. No beard? - No, it was itchy. I have a rash. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, everybody, I've got headbands here. - Camp. I love it. - Everybody, grab a headband. You're so extra, Mom. I had to be. It's special. Oh, no, no. Mom, Mom, can you switch with Alice? I want to match. Oh, sweetheart. - Alice, give me your headband. - Okay. Okay, everybody, try not to sweat because I am not paying for retouching. And they didn't live happily ever after because, I mean, let's face it, sweetheart, we're all food for worms. But they visited the mall and the Putt-Putt and the Taco Bell, and the world kept on spinning. This is so nice. Oh, dear. Oh, no. Mom, this is supposed to make you happy. I am happy. I am.
