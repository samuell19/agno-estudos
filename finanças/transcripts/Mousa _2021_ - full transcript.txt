Dear residents evacuate the area immediately It's very dangerous and unsafe for you and your children... We're close to the target, sir Wait for my orders out on the street and stay alert Roger, sir Moussa didn't do anything wrong I'm to blame If anyone has to be punished it would be me, not Moussa Dr. Fares, the kid uploaded the video on all channels - No one gets in - Alright We're on our way, once you have eyes the target, take him down The guy is inside And we did as you ordered No one gets in there Stay outside Evacuate! Yehya Yehya I know The guys are tough But it's good you're still alive Listen, Yehya This car is very fast It can go up to 500 km per hour I programmed a computer control module to increase the engine power I need to find a way to enlarge the tube without loosing pressure Twin Turbo You! Come Faster Solve the equation the way I explained it, here you go But that's not how I explained it Your approach is outdated This is a faster one If you like, sir, I can... - Explain it to you - Wait! What? Explain it to me? Did you think you're in university to teach the professors? What does your father do? - He was an engineer - He was? May he rest in peace - Go back to your seat - No My father didn't die He quit engineering - He makes watches now - A watchmaker Your dad sent you here so you'd become a watchmaker? You're here to listen Not to think Listen! Get out! You're an idiot You wouldn't understand anyway, out Are you crazy or dumb? Or blind? - Stop it - Get up if you're man! Get up! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Enough, man! This is just silly! If you want I'll make a show out of you here Go ahead, leave It is just 3 pounds Why are you meddling? Are you his lawyer? Yes, I'm his lawyer! Take your stuff and leave! It's not like it's the first time, Yehya! They always call you crazy You're like your father, or you don't know that your father is crazy? - Of course I know - You nasty! Tell me, Yehya Are you upset because of what happened? Or because it happened in front of Maryam? No! No! Careful with this gear It's rare You can't find it in Egypt Thank God, it's working Yehya! Let's do something fun, son Let's go out and get some fresh air You want to go to the shack? A long time ago, Yehya I used to like going to the shack to relax And think about your mom May she rest in peace Now I'm scared to open the door so it wouldn't explode in my face! Uncle Saleh What else do you want, Nasser? - Where's my daughter, Samah? - Samah went to her parents' house So that they save her and protect her from the insults and abuse she endured with you Did I pick her up from the Four Seasons? - She was just your maid! - Man! The police keeps raiding her house They insult her and disrespect her And why? Because she is married to you Go away Go, son May God forgive you Go, Nasser May God forgive you Fine Listen, Saleh! Saleh? What, Mr. Nasser? Who told the police about my new location? - Was it Samah? - No - I did - I thought so Think whatever you want But keep in mind if you mistreat Samah - you'd be mistreating me - Fair enough! Since you're hiding behind the ghost you brought to this life What do you think, ghost? Come, Yehya, show me what you've done at the shack Come on! Come Let's go, Yehya It's been so long... It's Yehya's now! Do you remember when you told me that mom, may she rest in peace got pregnant before me and the baby was stillborn? And if he was alive he'd be my older brother? Do you remember what would've been his name? Moussa Moussa What does it do? I programmed it to be controlled by this VR that I connect to the spinal cord to the temporal lobes in the brain And I control him to do whatever I think of What's that? Really nice Take that thing and sell it at a toy store When kids see this they'd kill each other and their parents They would stop at nothing to get it May you rest in peace, Zeinab God saved her from you and me But, why save her from you? Good evening Yehya, are you okay? I'm sorry I came unannounced I called many times but his phone was off Don't worry, child This thing is to blame - Ok, excuse me, uncle - No, no, don't worry Come in! Welcome! Maryam? Do you love Yehya? - You sympathize with him - No! - Did he tell you how we met? - Yes He told me about the girl who flipped his headset I once had a piano rehearsal and needed earphones I saw a guy in the corner with a headset bigger than his head I took it from him Two hours later, I came back to give it back but he wasn't there I asked everyone about him No one knew him at university He had no friends as if he doesn't exist Then I met him by chance I talked to him and learned his name I saw that he had problems like all of us The medical examination of Mister Yehya Saleh El Khayyat shows that he suffers from severe mental disorders And has trouble socializing since he was born Thus he was placed... Listen, I don't get any of this What I learned here is that you're a dumb kid That's normal Only a sick person can do this No one is perfect What treatments did you have as a child, Yehya? Electric shocks or pills? We had an idiot like you in Asyut His parents chained him so he would stop scaring other kids And one day, I unchained him and made him lead the way so he would scare the kids A family of two Yehya... and his father, Saleh How did your father die? My father is not dead I know you only saw your mother in pictures When you were born you can't imagine how happy I was to see you By the way you didn't cry like babies do But I cried instead, Yehya I cried over you mom May she rest in peace when she died on the day you were born God! God gives and God takes God compensates But Maryam loves you She's always with that guy from university What guy? A nice guy He looks good He dresses well - He speaks well - Talk to her, Yehya! A long time ago, there were no cell phones and all that Do you know what I used to do? I used to write letters to your mother and throw them from the balcony Your grandpa, may he rest in peace beat me hard back then So you... want me to get beaten? You're being beaten anyway! Let it be for a good reason! Listen, why don't you make us something to drink? I'll play a song you'll like very much Go ahead, Yehya What are you doing here? Finish already! Yehya, I don't want you to talk I just came to check on you and make sure you're okay I want to sell this house without the shack He has papers that his car works at a taxi company like Uber and Kareem He was in the North coast at the time of the incident You could have seen the wrong car registration number The kid has a week to be investigated Maybe he'll speak under pressure I'll call you then to close the case - We'll find something on him - You got the wrong guy It's not him - They had the wrong guy - No but I got scared Are you sure this is what happened? I mean, you weren't hallucinating? Because you told me you're father is not dead Fine What did you do then? I tried to commit suicide That's normal Because you're not a brave man I can imagine your father's pain while fire devours him and his only son watching him If I were you... I would've stayed with my father I'd have died with him That's what I would have done But you're not like him You're a coward You're brave, Yehya God! What is it, kid? You thought I would just go and leave you? You thought that death would separate us? I'm sorry You apologize if you step on my toe by mistake What do you want me to do? Avenge me Those kids are still out there If not tomorrow, the day after they'll kill someone else and leave his kids orphans I won't change the world Who will, then? I got scared! I froze and couldn't help you! I couldn't even let myself burn in the fire with you One of us had to burn so he'd light the way for the other Yehya, go make us something to drink so we can sit together and think about what we'll do Go! You drink... It was a rainy day A moonless night "I exist" "Even if you refuse to see me in the existence" "Even if you never hear my voice" "The day will come when you'll hear about me" "I exist" "I have no limits" I didn't see the light before I saw my father burn "I'm the truth" "Even if the world lies" "I'm the fire" "I'm the fire you can't put out" "A sure thing" "If the world refused me it should change" "I'm the new beginning" The fire that consumed his body... enlightened me "I exist" - "I exist" - Yehya Saleh El Khayyat "I exist" "I exist" "I exist" Let that be the end of grievances Welcome back! - You're a star now - It's not like I got life in prison! Chiaa Tell that girl Samia to meet me home I need a back massage from this two-week-vacation Nasser It seems you miss your father This kid is edgy today Moussa Come watch this video - I filmed it - What's that? - That's not a human being, guys! - I swear it's an alien What you hear in sci-fi movies... is getting closer to us by the deed of a killing robot It can kill anyone who might harm you This robot is insane! This robot and robotics thing A mythological winged creature Whoever wants to fight this robot will have to carry a weapon Of course you'll say Amr, you're... So if it wasn't for the kid passing by Moussa wouldn't exist And I wouldn't be sitting with you now Destiny brought us together Come on, Youssef Lamia, take Youssef and wait for me outside Nothing new The treatment won't work We'll keep trying until he dies like his brother? The only solution is surgery We've already talked about this This surgery is done in Germany - How much does it cost? - Not less than 200,000 Euros 200,000 Euros Alright, I have another solution There's a young doctor... I don't like experiments Hello, yes, sir The ministry of interior affairs? Okay, okay Okay, sir, okay Let's go, Lamia There's panic and shock amongst the Egyptians because of a robot roaming the streets We'd like an answer... This is a public opinion case This happened in broad day light and was filmed It would be a disaster if it happened again It'll be the case of Lieutenant Colonel Zakaria He has all the authority Dr. Fares Nassar head of the robotics department in the engineering faculty Dr. Fares will be with you so he would explain to us what exactly we're dealing with I need to be involved in every move or investigation involving this robot Any small detail matters Sir, you know my father well and what he taught me The flame the robot fired melted steel in a second We have a crucial weapon but we don't know its source We'll have no problem catching him - But before the police does - One last request, sir When we catch the one who did it I'd want to be part of interrogations - But it's not your job, Dr - You have our permission, Dr But you'll have to solve it in 24 hours I think the fastest way to get there is to delegate a member of the research team on the case We'll be one step ahead They have warrants and permissions to ask for, unlike us You surely know who I am Just like I know that you created Moussa Their bad luck made them cross your way Moussa got out of the flames that burned your dad And if the fire is still burning let me know An old friend... Mr. Zakaria the forensic team is here It's the one we saw in the video The welding of the door resulted from extreme heat coming from the robot which means the robot is made of heat resisting metal more than any other common metals - One more thing, this doctor... - Drop it, Hamdi You do as he says Orders from Mousaad I thought I came for vacation! Turns out I have to capture Spiderman! Go, Hamdi! Yehya! Open already! Man, I would've thought I busted you - Where's Maryam? - In her room and she's upset I know you are mad at me It wasn't intentional I had to go It's okay, father I was just lonely Sorry, my love It's my work, you know it No, no need to worry On the contrary I'd like to reassure people that the Security Forces... are doing the best they can and we'll hopefully find the person... This case is turning the world upside down But I want to know why is this professor involved? It's about a robot, Yehya! It's normal to have a robotics professor We know that the victims were registered criminals Even so... We have laws and a justice system - We're not in a jungle - Mr. Zakaria, the kid is here - What's his name? - Haytham Mohamed Jomaa - Check him up until I come - Okay, sir But to execute it in secret and without notice provokes terror and fear... I got you the sketch book you drew the twin turbo on And I found some other drawings you did One of them... is this one Where is it? I want to see it Don't worry I believe you, Haytham You can go - I swear... - Enough! - Go because you dad is worried sick - Okay, sir - Hamdi? - Yes! Put that kid under surveillance for 24 hours Phone records, emails Facebook, even PopG - I want him completely covered - Okay, sir What's that for, Dr? To help me sleep The General told me your son is sick It's okay He'll be fine Come on, stop staring We need a wider seat so that Moussa can slide under My dad's car is too small for him Yehya, are you doing this to avenge your father? To avenge all the world Does anyone else know? Maryam? - No - But you must tell her She must know that you're the knight everyone is looking for The one that requited his father's death You must prove her that you're a good guy, Yehya No You'll need to tell her one day Can I tell you something? You'd want me to tell her Don't give it that look I live here! It's been a while since I last been to my father's mansion Why do you want to help me knowing I'm a disaster? Because I know you're right, Yehya And I'm with what's right This world has to end and be burned down A flood should destroy it to be built all over again The old world has to end So what shall we do? I know a guy He sent me an email on the dark web He knows I built Moussa He said if I'm willing to continue I'll give you all the names of people who deserve to disappear There are dealers of everything Drugs and weapons Even humans Kids are being kidnapped and their organs are sold to the rich Those are way worse than your father's killers Yehya I need the files of the kids from the old castle - Get the files - And their every move since last week Take my place while you're at it Mr. Zakaria A mechatronics engineer tries to understand how humans think We have to understand how Moussa thinks and acts So we can find out how Moussa's creator thinks and capture him This is why I'm here Yes! What did you say? When did that happen? Second incident this month Moussa is back again but this time, it wasn't personal There are 20 hanged criminals Moussa? Is he controlled by an outlaw? Or a vigilante seeking justice on Earth? - I want the CCTV footage of this area - Okay, sir And every car that passed by and every detail about the drivers - All of them? - Yes, Hamdi The car that was burned and smashed I want to know its owner - Okay, sir - Wait, Hamdi The kids over there Check them one by one Okay, sir The robot is controlled remotely He must have a vehicle customized to transport him to such a place How do you make it move? I control him by spinal reflexes Like when you squeezed your hand before screaming Since I'm your partner now I want to try it Do you promise not to kill us? What do you see? I see myself Depending on the car's state and its length the robot's height is between 220 to 240 The robot is controlled remotely He must have a vehicle customized to transport him to such a place You're trying to become Adam Elsharkawy? But Adam Elsherkawy was a thief What are you? Are you applying a new law? A stuttering idiot like you is going to teach us what to do? An outlaw like you will become a role model for young kids? You think you can change the world? Who else will? - Good evening - How are you, Yehya? - What's that? - As you can see What went through your mind, Yehya while doing all this? What do you expect me to do? Let them beat me up at the university? Or you want me to be scared again? And not take vengeance for my father's death? That's not a solution, Yehya You'll die this way! I have already started and I can't stop now Yehya, I have never left you since I met you But now I'm leaving you I'm leaving so you'd come back to your senses You don't need Moussa to be a hero Get me the towers activities of this area Yes sir Here are the report of the castle kids One of them is a suspect in the murder of Saleh Zaki El Khayyat That genius doctor behind it... When we find him, we'll turn him in to the ministry or the university? We'll dismantle it piece by piece And his creator must be hanged as a lesson to others Stop at this car! - This car is emptied from underneath - Look up the plate number and owner Don't be upset, Yehya I knew this would happen from the beginning We have to hide everything now We don't know what she might do under shock or fear Yehya! Yehya! Sir, the car owner is Saleh Zaki El Khayyat The registration number H-369 Isn't it the same name in the castle files? Yes sir We found nothing Just some books, that's all Maryam! Sir, your people searched my house and didn't find anything - I want to know why I'm here - How many work with you? - Work with me? - Stop! You think I'm a fool? Where's the robot? Sir, tell me how can I help and I'll do it Come in! Mr. Ali, the lawyer, member of the Human Rights Association I'll be supervising the interrogation of Yehya Saleh El Khayyat Human rights, sir? What for? It's just a chat before he leaves with you Some tea for the gentlemen while we finish the papers and leave I'm leaving in two minutes Go ahead, Dr. Go ahead Hamdi! Goodbye At your service, Dr. - This guy will be released? - Yes, his record is clean But our team is setting hidden microphones in his house now So if there's anything on him we'll know Where's the recording room? Come in Come in, Dr. - Do you have kids, Hamdi? - A boy and two girls May God bless them - Is your salary enough? - It's fine Why? My father was an officer I wanted to become one like him Ever since I was born he used to call me Captain Fares But after he was killed on duty... I changed my mind and I studied mechatronics so I'm not an idiot And if they know out there what you're up to, they'll hang you - What are you talking about? - Someone is beating us to him Every time... giving information It's either me or you or Zakaria It's not me And Zakaria would kill you if he knew - Sir, I have information... - I'll know who it is who do you report to... - You're being unfair - I'll keep it between us - Sir, you're mixing up... - I'll tell Zakaria Mr. Zakaria Samir El Ashkar The CEO of Ashkar Association? Don't worry, no one will know What happened, Yehya? Did they... It was all a misunderstanding They understand now - Who? - Maryam, Yehya Why? Why would she do that? No, she must have panicked Thank God she is far now Dr. Fares! Help! Dr. Fares Youssef! Youssef! Youssef! His health is deteriorating daily Please, consider the new surgeon I mentioned before I told you, doctor I don't like to experiment - Excuse me - Sure - Don't worry, you'll be fine - I'm not afraid Moussa will save me Moussa will save you? Moussa will save you! Mr. Samir, I'm sorry I came without an appointment I want you to trust me I come to join forces - What do you need? - A two-way favor Help me capture Moussa - and I'll hand him to you - Why would you do that? 20 years ago, my father was stationed in Upper Egypt He had a mission to exterminate terrorists there Some men and a few kids Little young men He thought he could talk to them and change them distract them from the weapons But they killed him It's useless to negotiate with those people My father died because he was an idiot And my son died because I'm an idiot And my second son has the same disease, but I won't let him die Money - And how would you do it? - Join forces with me first A group of men will board the train undercover as travelers It's better if those men are not yours They shouldn't know who you are and have no connections with you But they should be heartless strong men And in mid way between Fayyoum and Beni Suef - We'll start - If anyone tries to make a move I'll kill you and I don't want to do that! Unless you ask for it! Meanwhile one of our men will film it and send it to a reporter So that when it happens people would know it's Moussa's fault Therefore Moussa and his creator will be far Away from the public's support We just got news of people being held hostages by a group of terrorists on a train going to Upper Egypt and passengers are being terrorized We'll show you an exclusive footage from inside the train Yes, Rika! And while the train is being hijacked a girl related to the kid called Yehya will be kidnapped I have reason to believe that this girl... is Yehya's weak point After that it'll unfold like a Domino We'll remain away from the target until we find a way to intervene, sir The first piece to fall will push the second the third and the fourth and so on until we reach Moussa We are still covering the train hijacking The minister of interior affairs stated that they have full control over the situation and the special forces are in place and the armed terrorists are being pursued Do it! Done! No one moves! Stay down! What is it, Yehya? Yehya? What is it, Yehya? - Move - Move Move! Go! Go! The train driver is down! - What's your name? - Maryam Yehya! We have Maryam And she is fine... Till now You know what we want and where to find us Yehya, it's none of your business... The number you are calling is not available You know where Maryam's house is, right? Yehya This is a trap, man! What trap? They know where I am and can come any second They know it's the only way to get to Moussa He said no one would die I sent men who don't know anything about me for him to kidnap my daughter? I came to find a solution Fares, the girl you have is my daughter You think I didn't know? Tell that kid he has 24 hours He knows where to find me Fine, Fares! If you start a war Maryam will be the only victim I want to know his full name Fares Abdelazziz Khalil Nassar Now all the cards are unfold I sent his name to your friend What are you up to? If I take Moussa the disruption on the train might happen again So you'll meet Fares alone? Fares is curious to know the whole story And when I make sure that Moussa disappeared I'll help Maryam out This man will help me Can you do it without Moussa? I am the one who built Moussa This is the location of Fares' phone I know you're innocent But your service is no longer needed My name is Yehya Saleh El Khayyat and I decided to tell the whole story I got in the engineering faculty Other students used to beat me up at university And girls used to defend me because I couldn't defend myself My father died They burned him in cold blood right before my eyes I couldn't defend him I lived alone ever since... until Moussa came I made him my friend I treated him like a brother I couldn't find flesh and blood to befriend So I made friends with a pile of metal Moussa didn't do anything wrong I'm the one to blame And I'm sorry for what happened If anyone must be punished it would be me, not Moussa Moussa and I are at 15 Youssef El Saddiq street I'll miss you, Moussa And if I caused anyone any harm He can come and take him And so that no one gets hurt the smoke will lead you to the house Residents should leave their homes now The situation is very dangerous Be careful, Yehya I'm Yehya Saleh El Khayyat The kid is inside we did what you asked for No one gets in Stay outside Evacuate! Yes Are you sure? OK Keep me posted Moussa exploded But Moussa's blueprint... is up here Let Maryam go and I'll give it to you Maryam is staying here And God knows what they'll do to her until you start drawing Samir El Ashkar The man you talked to... It's his daughter If anything happens to her he won't let you go Let the girl go but follow her Don't go out the gate before I say so Let her talk to me Yes, Yehya, don't worry - Maryam is with me - Don't let her mention anyone Hello! Yehya... - We're leaving him? - If anything happens, we will I've done my part Anything else before we start? Excuse me, Dr. Crazy people like me... have rituals while working Do whatever you want If you want to change everything then, do it - Did you betray him? - I swear I didn't I haven't said a word to anyone! I swear it! Do your best, Einstein You know your way is outdated? I'll explain to you the new way Tell me what happened - I'll tell Dr. Fares - What will you tell Dr. Fares? There's a car going around? You're right Give me a cigarette Ten seconds Seven What... What's happening outside? Hey! What's happening outside? Hey! What's happening outside? - Answer! Enough nonsense! - Answer! Enough nonsense! Put your shirt down or I'll shoot you - Yehya, I'll kill you! - Yehya, I'll kill you! One Yehya, I'll kill you! Yehya, I'll kill you! Yehya, I'll kill you! - Leave the girls there and come - Okay Come, the boss needs us You have to leave now The place will blow up in 10 minutes Mr. Fares, we must leave Mr. Fares? Mr. Fares? Go check what's happening outside - Mr. Fares? - Keep an eye on the boy Rika, move Move right away You promised me if things go wrong, you'd run away You've always kept your promises - Hello, Yehya - Maryam I might not know how to look you in the eye But I might not find the time to tell you this I... I love you Rika, we can't leave Open the door! Rika! Rika! He told me to give you this if things go wrong Maryam... If you're reading this now it means I'm gone but you're fine And that's what matters You being fine I'm not worried about you because Rika is there Rika is crazy but she's sweet and brave I was able to protect you without Moussa Like you told me I don't need Moussa to be a hero Like my father used to say If the righteous ones remain silent the wicked will think they're right Maryam, take good care of yourself Don't worry about me I'm in a better place with my parents Yes, Safwat, do you have the money and the tickets? Okay, great Yes, Iman Let the new doctor do the surgery Yes Do you want to listen to music? Yes, music People like us don't die "Moussa's explosion site"
