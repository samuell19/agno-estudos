- Hi. - Hi. - Here... - Thanks. My parents gave me money to buy their Christmas gifts. My dad doesn't care what he gets. But my mom... I thought of getting her a frying pan. I'm going to spend my own money on my little brother. He's been so sweet. - Hi, Anna. - Hi. - Say hello to your mom. - I will. Have you thought of presents for your family? Not really. I haven't bought any. It's rather cold today. Ready? - See you later. - See you. Anna? Anna! What? I hear you still go to your father's boat. - So? - You know I don't want you to! - If you don't pump out... - I don't care. - Are you deaf? The boat will... - Sink, yes. - Fuck you, you grumpy bitch. - What was that? Fuck you! Just do what I tell you, Anna. Do you hear me? But mother, that's the way it is. Yes... No, don't you do that! Because I say so. No, he hasn't called me. No. No, that's none of your business. Well, she's alright. Yes, she does. Mom, honestly...! Do you think I'm a baby? Well, you're a child, and this is not for children. My little pickle. My little tickle pickle. Stop it...! You can watch porn, when you're 16. Hey, what are you doing? Stop it! Okay. You wimp! - Fuck you! - Take it easy. - Let's go down to the boat and... - You and your crappy boat. Shut up! Your dad doesn't give a damn about you or the boat. You just shut up. What kind of a man is he anyway? Walks out to fuck somebody else. Shut the fuck up. Fucking wimp! - You can't sit around like this. - I guess not. Christmas is just around the corner. If only I hadn't been so cold and rejecting. - Towards him? - Yes. You never were. You know that. You have to get your act together. For your own sake, and Anna's sake. - I can't do it. - Yes, you can. You just have to clean up and prepare the house for Christmas. - Hi, Anna. - Hi. With greetings from Prozac Peter - That's nice of him. I'm making the Christmas village. - This one is my favourite. - It's my favourite, too. - What have you been doing today? - I went to the swimming pool. With Ole? No, I went alone. Don't do that! You'll kill a sailor! If I'm lucky it will be your dad. You know what you are? You're a fucking whore! Shut up, Anna! - No, you shut up! - Don't talk to me like that! He didn't only leave me. He left you as well. He hasn't even called you. No, Dad left because you didn't want to fuck him. - Hi. - Hi. - Did you catch anything? - No. I want to apologize for, you know... That's okay. - I understand if you're mad... - No, that's okay. Who was the girl in the pool? Oh, that was Ida. Are you friends, or what? No, she's Per's ugly daughter She's staying over Christmas. Okay. - Have you seen his new wig? - Yes, it's gross. - It's made of nylon or something... - Yes, it looks like a broom. Why isn't he just bald? Does he really think he looks better with that crap on his head? I love you. What? I've been missing you. I've missed you, too. The only thing I want is to give my daughter a Christmas present! It's my right as a father! I knew it. She's crazy. Mom? Mom? Mom?
