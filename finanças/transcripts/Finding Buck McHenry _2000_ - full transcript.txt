[baseball announcer on TV] [bat hitting ball] [crowd cheering] These little spotty ones go on both sides? Yeah, these little spotty ones go on both sides. Hey, Jason. Where's the fire? Diamond three at school. Big game? Yeah, it's our last practice game, and I'm starting. Hey, good luck. Hey, Jason, put your helmet on. - Jason, stop right there. - Jason, listen to your mom. Okay, Mom. Thank you. You think he'd know by now. Maybe take the sidewalk next time. [laughing] Come on, let's go! I'm coming, Jase. Calm down. You're running behind, there! You'll make us late for practice. Come on! Let's go. [laughs] - Hey! - Yeah! Woo! I'm so pumped. Whatever, dude. Hey, pizza guys. We'll have the pepperoni. You got us wrong. We're ball players. Ah. Who is that guy? He's the new sports guy on Channel 4. Chuck somebody. They say he's funny. Pizza guys? Yeah, real funny. [scoffs] You wait and see, Tuggy. I'm gonna hit a home run. Try and get on base. Ball players, huh? That sounds promising. Maybe. Listen, Kim, we both have to give this town a fair shake. It's just so tough to move, Dad. I know, honey. But the facts are you're gonna be a big hit on the diamond and I'm gonna be a big hit at the station. So dobbers up, huh? Man: Okay, guys, let's spread out and play some catch. Warm up, now! Step and throw. Whoa, Diaz! Hey, I don't want to see any of that in the game. Now focus, huh? It's our year, Tug. I bet you he has me batting fifth, right behind you. Listen, Jason, keep your mind on the game, okay? And don't talk back to Coach. Even when he's wrong? Even when he's right. Boy: Come on, Jason! Boy 2: Come on, McGwire! Come on, Jason. Fastball, outside. And lighten up. [kids jeering] - Yeah, that'll scare him. - Get real. All right, just meet the ball, Jason. Nothing fancy, okay? Boy: We know you can hit it. Boy 2: Swing, batter, batter! Swing! Boy: Swing! Mister McGwire, I presume. Stop it. Act normal. Tugger, the guy homers a lot this way. Yeah, well, you're not him, okay? Boy: Come on, McGwire. Come on, Jason. [boys groaning] Look at that. Total whiff. - Come on, McGwire! - You can do it, McGwire! - Go, Jason! - Come on, Jason! - Home run, Mark! - Come on, Jason! [boys cheering] Run! Play it out. You can make it. Come on! [boys groaning] Out. That was close. Good job. But, Coach-- - Not even close. - I'm not out! Not out? Five feet, pal. [grumbles] Coach: Take a water break, guys. Be back in five minutes. I'm gonna go talk to the coach for a minute. I'll be back. Okay? Tug, did you think I was out? Yep. Baseball cards ain't baseball, Jason. Yeah. In the game, you actually have to move. Coach? Chuck Axelrod. Oh, of course. Wayne Borker. Good to meet you. I wanted to see about getting my daughter Kim on a team. She'd be a real asset. I'm sorry, Mr. Axelrod. There's just no space. Every team's got more kids than they need. In fact, we're going to be cutting kids. Could you give her a look, at least? She was an All-Star last year. She can hit, run, field. I'm sure she's great. Got an idea, though. Why don't you start up a new team? No, listen, I'll get the other coaches to fax you the names of the kids they're gonna release. Are you kidding me? I just moved to town, and you want me to recruit a baseball team? I don't have that kind of time, sir. Just a thought. I'm sorry. I guess she can't play this season. Okay. I'll do it. I'll make the time. I'll get my daughter Kim to help. Great. Fax number's on the card, sir. Okay. Well, I'll have you the information today. Good luck. Thanks. Okay, thank you. [boys chattering] Coach: Team meeting! Over here. You know, all those kids weren't too bad. The last kid was a joke. The way he ran? The shortstop was asleep. He didn't back up the third baseman. And the third baseman has no arm. He's just lucky that kid ran slow. You know, the coach and I talked about starting an expansion team. So if we can get a team together, we'll kill them. You're just making this team for me, aren't you, Dad? No, don't be silly. I've always wanted to be an owner. [engine starts] Hey, I want to be a star! That guy gonna put us on TV? No, no. We're not gonna be on TV. [boys groan] No, look. Chuck Axelrod's moved here recently, and he wants to make a new team. Yeah, a team of rejects. [laughing] Now, look, wait a minute. I wouldn't put it that way. Now, he's asking the league for enough extra players to form a new team, so we'll all probably contribute one player. We shouldn't cut anybody, Coach. We've only got 13 players, right? Well, big league teams carry 25 because there are always injuries. Kids go on vacation. Shut up, Jason. Uh, Jason, you're our back-up catcher and fourth outfielder. You know, with Tug around, you're never really gonna... I think on an expansion team, you'd probably start. You're cutting me? [sighs] Look, this isn't easy on me either, Jason. But I really think it's for the best. You're going to get a lot more playing time. Look, I'll call your dad. Let him know what's going on. Sure. Whatever. - It's okay, Jase. - Tough break, man. Tug: Sorry, buddy. Man, this is the worst day of my life. You all right? You're making tracks on my floor. It was muddy outside. I just mopped that floor. Oh. Sorry. Coach cut you? Yeah. How'd you know? I saw you running to first base. Did you think I was out? Son, if you'd have stayed in that batter's box any longer, the would have charged you rent. Here, take this. Let me show you how to beat out a grounder. What I needed was a good ump. You gotta call close plays with your ears. It's what you hear first, the ball hitting the mitt, or the foot hitting the bag. Suit yourself. Thanks anyway. Voice on TV: You'll never catch me, you weasel! Voice on TV 2: Oh, yeah? Watch this. [voices grunting] [TV shuts off] Aaron, now, not many people know this, but you could go blind watching television when the sun is shining. [laughs] Tell you what. I'll play catch with you. No thanks, Grandma. Oh, you don't think an old lady can play baseball, huh? Well, we will see about that. I have no idea how to do this. [laughs] Aaron, you've got to show me. Well, all right, then. I'll show myself. Okay. You see what you made me do? You won't talk and you won't throw a ball. You're grieving. Well, we're all grieving, Aaron, but we just got to go on living. Now, you go and find your grandpa and give him this. I expect he might be getting hungry. Where is he? He's probably down by the lake. Or he's at the school finishing up his chores. He's between here and there. You can find him. Aaron? Yes, ma'am? Stop calling me ma'am like that. I'm your grandma. And I love you very much. You understand that? Yes, ma'am. That's okay. We've got to give us time. Here. Take this in case you feel like fishing. Chuck: Kim? Where are you? In here. Hey. Hi, Dad. I think we're going to need more shelves. Yeah, you don't realize how much stuff you accumulate until you actually move. Listen, I gotta go to the station. I'll be back around 8. I can help you unpack then. Okay. You okay? Um...it's just that I don't know anyone here. [sighs] We'll fix that soon enough. Once we get our team together, every kid in the neighborhood's gonna know who you are. Sure, Dad. Well, let's get busy, then. While I'm at the station, why don't you go through the list of players they faxed me. We'll see where they live, and we'll recruit them. Build a team. Make those kids offers they can't refuse, okay? Okay. Good luck today, Dad. Let 'em know who you are. This is Chuck Axelrod, and welcome to "Sports Line". - See ya. - Bye. Jason Ross, bats 200. Alex Whitman bats 165. They even look like rejects on paper. Grandpa, look. That stupid-- Hang on, boy. What's wrong with him? He must be crazy. Hey. Hey, you need a hand with this? Come on, let's have it. There you go. There you go. You seem to be having a strange day today. Give me your hand. [grunts] There you are. Now, you all right? There. You better take those wet clothes off. All of them. Take all those clothes off. Aaron, this young man was cut by his baseball team today so he jumps his bike into the lake. Just having fun. Oh, is that what it was, huh? Aaron, do the kids down in Memphis jump their bikes into the lake for fun? I never heard they did. Yeah, well, maybe up here they do. This is Aaron, my grandson. He played some ball for Memphis, Tennessee. They tell me he was an All-Star. Now he's living with me and his grandma. You're going to have to put some linseed oil on that glove when it dries. What's your name, son? Jason. Well, Jason, you don't have to be discouraged. I mean, you ever heard of Willie Mays? He almost got cut once. Ace 455? What's that, Ace 455? That's his rookie card. I got it. Baseball card? What would a card like Mays cost? Plenty. Not as much as Mantle's rookie card, but plenty. Why would Mantle's card be worth more than Mays? I don't know, it just is. Maybe you want to find out about that one of these days. Both were superstars, played in the same era, but that's where it ends. Willy Mays played longer, put up better numbers, could beat you more ways. He was something. Even when he was just 16 playing with the Birmingham Black Barons. The Birmingham who? Black Barons. I've heard of every team in the country, every farm team, and I've never heard of them. Don't be so proud of your ignorance. You've probably never even heard of the Homestead Grays or the Pittsburgh Crawfords or Josh Gibson. What about Satchel Paige? Ace 238, Cleveland Indians. Oh, well that was near the end of his career. But before that, Satchel pitched all over the Negro League, bringing in the crowds, making the big money. Borrowing soap from his teammates 'cause he was too cheap to pay for his own. What leagues, Mr. Henry? The Negro Leagues. That's where black men played baseball before they were allowed to play in the white major leagues. There were some giants in those days. There were great baseball players. Take "Cool Papa" Bell. Cool Papa was so fast, that he got hit by his own line drive. [laughing] Listen, Wayne, you've been coaching these guys since T-ball. I don't see how you can cut a kid who's been playing with you his whole life. Tom-- We're talking someone who eats, sleeps, and dreams baseball. He dreams baseball cards, Tom. You know, look, I like Jason. He loves the game. But it's hard when your skills don't measure up to your dreams. He's great on dreaming the big dreams, my son, but he's not much on the hard work it takes to get there. He's a kid. He lives in the clouds. Thanks, Wayne. Hey, Aaron. Why don't we show our young friend here how to beat out a ground ball? All right, now... [grunts] Jason, there's your bat. All right, let's put home plate right over here. Here it is. All right, now, Aaron, I want you to pitch. I want you to throw him some of that hot stuff that you used down in Memphis, Tennessee. No, Grandpa. I don't want to pitch. All right. All right. I'll pitch. Okay, we'll pretend that Aaron is that boy that threw you out this morning. Now, when I throw the ball, you're going to hit my fastball, and you're going to run right over to the spot right there. And you're going to run like you've got hot coals under your feet. And you're not going to look to see where the ball went that you hit, 'cause you're going to see it without looking. That's why God put the corners in your eyes. Now, are you ready? 'Cause I am going to be throwing smoke, here. Are you ready? Okay. [chuckles] All right. [bat hitting ball, crowd cheering] Run! Like hot coals. Come on, hot coals! Run! Safe! Yes. [laughs] One, two, three, four, five. Five bucks each. Let's call it $20 even, all right? There you go. $20. Jim! Jim-- Yeah, yeah. Just a sec. Jim, there's a whole league I never even heard of. Hey, Jase. Hey, you know, Tug was here looking for you. Man, oh, man, what happened to you? How come your shirt's inside out? The Kansas City Monarchs, the Pittsburgh Crawfords, the Birmingham Barons. And Willie Mays played for them. How come I never heard of them? Oh, well, it's the old Negro Leagues. Yeah, back before baseball was integrated by Jackie Robinson and the Dodgers. Sure, I got a video here some place from the old Negro Leagues Museum in Kansas City. Here we go. You can watch it in the office if you like. Hey, but call Tug, right? He's worried about you, man. Hey, Jim, why is Willie Mays' rookie card worth less than Mickey Mantle's when Mays had the better career? [sighs] Well, Mays was black. Mantle wasn't. What's that got to do with anything? Everything. And nothing. TV Announcer: And it's a game where the Negro athlete of today and yesteryear has left a bright mark. Heading the list of famous players is the king of the moundsmen, Satchel Paige. He's the idol of other fine young pitchers. For two decades, Old Satch has toed the slab with the best of them. His game heart and great arm have carried him to the heights of baseball glory. Of Satch they have said, and always will say, he gave his best to the game. Don't feel like talking. I understand. You know, your daddy... Your daddy didn't like fishing, either. All he wanted to do was to skip stones and pretend that they were baseballs. I warned him that that would make him a sidearm, and sidearmers don't last long in the big leagues. Your daddy... Yeah. He could've made it in the big leagues. It's all right to cry, son. Your grandma says tears lubricate the soul. She worries about you, losing your daddy and your mama that way. It was hard. It was hard on us, too. But, like you grandma says, we're family. So, we grieve together and then we go on together. Right? I try, Grandpa. That's all that a man can do. Well, what'd you think? These guys were fantastic! Are there cards for guys in the Negro Leagues? Oh, yeah, yeah. I gotta box in here somewhere. Listen, Jase, when Tug was here before, he told me you got cut. They want to put me on an expansion team with everybody that stinks. It's tough man, but look, some ball players who got put on expansion teams in the majors, they did just fine. - Dean Chance. - Yeah. - Bill Stoneman. - Yeah. I guess we could have a shot. If we had some coaching. All right, tell you what I'll do. If you get a coach, I'll get a sponsor. Me. And instead of going to the Dairy Queen after games, we could come here and get free baseball cards! You're on, Jim. I'm gonna go get the coach. Yeah, you just change your shirt. Hey, and who said anything about free cards? Oh, well. How'd the fishing go? I got a couple of bites. Well, what about you, Aaron? What'd you get? Nothing. Nothing. He caught a couple of branches. Too small, though. We had to throw them back. Sidearm. [laughing] Aaron, would you take these in the house? Then meet me out back. Well, I see you made some progress with Aaron. Mr. Henry, hand me the bonemeal. Yeah, I made some progress, thanks to a crazy little kid named Jason Ross. Mm-hmm. Was he down by the lake? Not by the lake. He was in the lake. Excuse me, ma'am. Would you happen to know where Mr. Henry lives? Sure. Your grandma. [chuckles] She made me buy that thing for you. I was gonna buy a basketball hoop, stuff like that, you know? She said no. That woman got a will of steel. But maybe she was right. You know, maybe you oughta just zing a couple of fast ones right down the gut. Make you feel better. Man, they tell me down in Memphis that you're hot stuff. Yeah! Say, what about this? All right? Bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, two men out, and you, up on the mound, got to protect a one-run lead. The count is 3 and 2 on the meanest homerun hitter in the league. How would you do it, Aaron? Would you throw him your fastball? Or would you make it your curve? And don't tell Grandpa about it. Show me. Do I have to, Grandpa? No, no. No, Grandson. No, you don't. Grandpa understands. Yeah, Grandpa understands. Excuse me, ma'am? Oh. You in some kind of trouble, young man? Trouble? No, why? It just looks like you've been rolling in the mud. You looking for somebody? Is Mr. Henry home? Oh, yes. I believe he is. Well, come on inside. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. I'm really sorry to bother you, Mrs. Henry. I just need to speak to Mr. Henry about the 12-year-old league. The season's starting right away, and we don't have a coach. I was thinking Mr. Henry could coach us. Mr. Henry coach a baseball team? I don't think so, son. Mr. Henry could be a great coach. I was down at the lake today, and-- You the boy who fell in the lake? I jumped in. I heard about you. Jason Ross. You met my grandson Aaron, didn't you? Yep. Do you really think Mr. Henry knows enough to coach a baseball team? He coached me, and I'm pretty hard to coach. You wait right here. I'll go tell Mr. Henry. Okay. Thanks. Mack, you've got a visitor. Well, we're busy here, Annie. Who is it? It's Jason Ross. Wants to ask you something. Says it's real important. That boy is getting to be a part of my life. Tell him to come back later. No, no, Mack. I want you to listen to what he's got to say. Mr. Henry: All right, Annie. I'll be right back. Don't do anything that would annoy me, like throwing a baseball. Mrs. Henry, what's wrong with Aaron? Aaron's mother and father were killed in a car wreck down in Memphis. It's been very hard on all of us, but especially Aaron. Jason. To what do we owe the pleasure of this visit? Mr. Henry, I didn't know about the accident. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. Well, try saying what you came to say. Jason, tell him. We found a sponsor for the expansion team. Mm-hmm. And I know who should coach us. Who? You, Mr. Henry. Me? Are you out of your mind? Jason, why don't you go on out back and find Aaron and tell him about your new team. - You bet. - Mm-hmm. And tell him who's thinking about being the coach. I ain't thinking about no such thing. [door closes] Hey, Aaron. Hey. So, what's up? Nothing. Is that your glove? Yeah. Can I see it? I was a back-up catcher on my old team. But I'm gonna start on our new one. Your grandpa's gonna be our coach! He say that? Actually your grandma said it. Not the same as him saying it. He said you used to be a pitcher. Used to be. Why don't you pitch me some? I mean, I just got cut from my team today, and I'd just really like to catch a pitch or two. You can't catch me with that. Wanna bet? Give me the ball. Let's see your heater. [grunts] Ah! How come you didn't try to catch it? Are you kidding me? That would've broken my hand! I'd need a catcher's mitt and a sponge. Make that two sponges. [laughing] The boy is laughing. I think Jason Ross and his baseball team are just what the doctor ordered. And you are going to be the coach. Now, Annie, I can't do-- You want our grandson back happy, like a child should be? You don't have to ask me that. But I ain't never coached a team in all my life. Then it's about time you got started. Is this Chuck Axelrod's house? He's not home. Is he going to be home soon? What's the big rush? Well, he's organizing our team. We've already got a coach and a sponsor, but the season starts in a few days, and we don't have time to recruit players. But, hey, we've already got the best players anyway. We've got the pitcher and the catcher. Shortstop's important, too. So we'll find one. You already got one. Who? Me. Girls play softball. I play baseball. You any good? I'm better than him. I saw you run out that ground ball yesterday, if you call that running. Hey, it was just a practice. Practice soft, play soft. Who's the coach? My grandpa. Your grandfather? So I'm supposed to play on a team of rejects coached by a guy that's a billion years old? First practice is tomorrow. It's your call. This just keeps getting better and better. [footsteps approaching] Hey, young lady. Are you a part of this team? I don't know. Maybe. She say's she plays shortstop, grandpa. She thinks she's better than us. We'll see about that. Would you come over here, please? What's your name? Kim. Kim, I know you play shortstop, but I sure could use you over in left field. Right, like Jason's actually going to hit it out there. Stranger things have happened. So, left field, if you please. Okay. Now, Jason, enter the batter's box. Aaron, I want you to pitch. All right. Jase? Jason. Where'd you get that stance? From Mark McGwire, off his baseball card. And how many homeruns have you hit using Mark McGwire's stance? None. Okay, I think maybe we can fix that. All right, here's what I want you to do. I want you to turn around. Turn around. Sit down. Here? Sit down right there. Come on. Now, put your bat back. Lift up your elbow. Now, I'm gonna take this chair from under you, but I want you to stay in the sitting position. Okay? You ready? There you go. All right. Now, lift up just a little. Right there. Freeze! Now, that is your new batting stance. How does it feel? Terrible. Good. All right, Aaron, lob it in. [grunting] Unbelievable. [grunts] Wow. He can coach. [laughing] Wow, Grandpa, you must have played some ball. Well, I wasn't born in China. You know, when we were down in Valdosta, we didn't fish all the time. Sometimes we played ball, too. How'd you know about that really cool chair thing, Mr. Henry? Well, you know the old Negro Leagues that I was telling you about? Well, when they would come to town, we'd put them up in our houses. And when they came to watch us play our little games, they would teach us some of the tricks. Well, now, what do you think? Have we got a team, or have we not? Team. Team. Team. All right, team, let's play some ball. Back into the box. All right. Lob it on in. [chattering] Man: We're ready for a sound check on stage 4. Mitch, are the graphics up and ready to go? Latest scores, hot off the press. Come on, Brad. Give me a break. I'm new in town. I need a big story, not scores. Well, when you find that big story, Chucky, let me know, will ya? Because I've been looking for it all my life. But until you do, my advice, pal, is read what they put in front of you, and smile pretty for the camera, okay? Jason: Hey, Jim, these cards are incredible! Look, here's Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, "Double Duty" Radcliffe, Bullet Rogan. These guys weren't allowed to play with white ball players? Nope. Against them sometimes, but not on the same team. Not even in the same league. That's so mean. Mean's a good word. Scared's another. See, a lot of people knew how good these guys were, and they didn't want them competing. This guy's name is Buck McHenry. "Buck McHenry was a powerful right-handed fireballer "who pitched in the late 1940s for the Crawfords. "Although he only pitched three years, "he won 90 games." Wow. "After a scrape with the law, McHenry dropped from sight, "and was never heard from again." Buck McHenry's wind-up, it's exactly like Mr. Henry's. Even their names sound alike. McHenry. Mack Henry. Mr. Henry! Funny thing, Aaron. One day I never heard of Jason Ross. Next day, I never hear of anybody but Jason Ross. What do you want, Jason? Mr. Henry, I've been looking all over for you. You found me. I've got something to show you. You too, Aaron. What is it? It's a baseball card from the old Negro Leagues. You want me to stop what I'm doing to look at a baseball card, Jason? Sir, look. It's Buck McHenry's card. It says how he pitched three years for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, won 90 games, and then disappeared after a scrape with the law and became a school janitor. You know what I think, Mr. Henry? Buck McHenry became Mack Henry. Can I see it? I think this is your gramps, Aaron. I mistook you for a normal kid, Jason. You know, a little energetic, but normal. Don't tell me I got you wrong. This doesn't look like my grandpa, Jason. It was taken a long time ago. You're making up a story. What if I'm right? What if pigs had wings? It doesn't say he was a school janitor. They probably ran out of room. All right. Let's take a look at me as an immortal. Is that you, Grandpa? What? Does that look like me? You think an immortal like Buck McHenry would wind up fixing squeaks in a school house door? [scoffs] No way. Here, here. Take it. Now, give me that can of oil there, will you, Aaron? - Sure, Grandpa. - All right. Jason, do you have any idea what time it is? I know. I'm just looking up something on the Internet. I'll only be a second. What is that, a homework assignment? No, Buck McHenry. Remember, I told you about that theory-- Oh, right, right, right. The baseball star slash custodian fantasy. It's true. I didn't make it up. The man said it wasn't him. You yourself told me he said that. I know, but I know it's him. I can just feel it in my bones. And if the kids know, everybody will want to play on our team. Jason, stop. Just stop. Dad, why'd you do that? Because you think you can push a button and make the world the way you want it to be. It doesn't work that way. You can't turn a man into someone he isn't just so you can have the baseball team of your dreams. Now get into bed and stay there. Dad, I know it's him. Do you care what he said? He told you he's not Buck McHenry. Why isn't that good enough for you? Because he has to say that. He had a scrape with the law. He changed his name. That's it. Good night, Jason. What are we gonna do about him? Well, he's young, Tom. He has dreams. Is that really so terrible? Yes, it is terrible. This isn't about Jason pretending he's Mark McGwire. This is about another human being. Yeah, well, maybe he'll have a good night's sleep and see it your way in the morning. Didn't you love seeing him fly out of here? [laughing] I can't believe that's the same child that's been living with us. He is a different boy, all right. For the first time since the accident, I'm starting to feel hope. You know what? Feels good. [chuckles] Hey. Hey. Where's Jason? He'll be here. Well, we better get going. We have a whole lot of recruiting to do, you know, and it's going to take time. Look at all the kids on the list. Oh, good. Here he comes. What are you guys sitting around for? Where have you been? Checking up on Aaron's grandpa. You still on that crazy idea? It's not crazy. Jason, what are you talking about? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't play anymore. Franklin, we need you. You've seen me play. Nobody needs me. I only play to impress my dad. But you were good. Kinda. Good as me, anyhow. See ya. That your team? Yeah. Do you want to play on it? I don't know. Who's your great coach? Mr. Henry. The school janitor? Him? Yeah, but that's not all he is. He used to be a big baseball star. Yeah, right. All school janitors are big baseball stars. Get real. That does it. All right. There are hook slides, straight ons, pop-ups. What about headfirst slides? Those are the ones I like best. Well, this is not about what you like, Jason. It's about what you're going to do to help the team win, right? We'll get to headfirst later. Okay. With the pop-up slide, the trick is to slide in feet first and then come in standing up. I can do it, Grandpa. You can? All right. Go ahead. Show us. Well, now. Aaron! - Who taught you that? - My daddy. Ah, well, he taught you good. Okay, Kim. Show them what you can do. You push off on the leg you bend. All right. Not bad. Well, all right. Now you, Jase. Aw, no. I'm not the sliding type. - I mean-- - Do it, Jason. Here goes. - [chuckles] - Way go to, Jason. Well. Hey, Jase! Hey, Jase. Jase. Check this out. Here's that web site you were telling me about, the Negro League's Baseball Museum. Check pitchers. Uh... Right-handed. McClure. McDaniels. Look, McHenry. What'd I tell ya? "Known for his blazing speed and short career, "McHenry was born in Valdosta, Georgia." Wait, wait, wait. Buck McHenry was born in Valdosta. Valdosta, Georgia, Jim. Bingo! Yeah, bingo. I'm very confident they'll settle, Mrs. Baker, and I fully-- Jason. Won't you please sit down? Thank you. What are you doing here? Dad, when some has a scrape with the law, is it the same thing as a felony? My son Jason. I see you have another budding lawyer in the family. Yes. Dad, if a person commits a crime, but there's no trial or anything, would there still be fingerprints? Jason, Mrs. Baker and I are trying to have a meeting. Go ahead and answer him. You can't start them in the law too early. Very well. If the scrape with the law was a felony, there would be a record of it somewhere, and possibly fingerprints, too. You would have to see where it was committed, and find out if a warrant was issued, and whether the warrant was still outstanding. Thanks, Dad. Jason, this is the kind of thing that's best left to the police. Not to worry, Dad. I can handle it. Uh-huh. [bicycle approaching] Jason. Did I disturb you? Yes. Sorry. I went down to the school. They said you'd gone, so I-- Jason... what are you doing here? Well, I like to fish. Good. Take my rod. Um, I really don't know how to fish. I never knew you were born in Valdosta, Georgia, Mr. Henry. That right? You've been going your whole life without knowing that? Buck McHenry was from Valdosta, Georgia. You're on that again, huh? Well, a lot of people lived in Valdosta, Georgia. Thousands of them. Why aren't you after them to be Buck McHenry? 'Cause they're not. 'Cause you're him. No, I am not. I am not Buck McHenry. I know that doesn't suit you, but that's the way it is. What about that scrape with the law? You never give up, do you? Jason... I like you. You're persistent. You're a digger. You got my grandson interested in life again, so I owe you one, but you are pig-headed. Drop this Buck McHenry business. I'm not him. I'll never be him. What you're doing is embarrassing, so stop it. Now see, if you look closely, there's an indentation in the corner. Now that proves that it's genuine. Yeah, check it out yourself. Oh, excuse me for just a minute. Something I can get for you, Mr. Ross? Actually, I was hoping to talk to you. I'm a little concerned about Jason. That old baseball card of yours seems to have sent him right over the edge. He's convinced that custodian is a famous pitcher. Someone named Buck McHenry? Yeah, I know, but there's no chance of that. Buck McHenry's dead. You know that for certain? Yeah, I checked it out personally. Hartford Cole, a guy who works at the Negro League Museum, he told me so himself. Did you tell Jason that? No, I haven't had the chance. I just got off the phone. I'll tell Jason. That'll put an end to this nonsense. Thank you, Jim. And I'm sure that Mr. Henry will thank you, too. Sorry I'm late. Where have you been? Having a brilliant idea. The season's starting next week, and we only have three players, right? So, suddenly, I realized, Kim's dad is a famous sportscaster. What was I thinking? We're not using the media. Jason, I need to talk to you. Listen to this, when I tell Chuck Axelrod about Mr. Henry's real identity, he'll do a TV story on him. Jason. Then everybody will know that my coach is Buck McHenry. Every kid in town will bust their butts to be on our team. Jason, I found out something you need to hear. Now, I was talking to Jim, and he told me Buck McHenry is dead. That's not true. I'm afraid it is. You can ask Jim. He would've told me! He was going to, he just-- Jason! Jason, come back here. - Jason! - Jason, where are you going? Jason? Oh. It's not true, what you told my dad about Buck McHenry being dead. I'm afraid it is, Jase. I got it straight from the source. If Buck McHenry was dead, wouldn't it say so on his card? I don't know. That's because he's alive and he's gonna coach our team. You'll see, Jim. Mr. Henry is Buck McHenry, and I'm gonna prove it. Jason. Jason, be reasonable. Reasonable? When did I become an adult? [knocking on door] I got it, Dad. Chuck: All right. Jason? - Hey. - What are you doing here? Can I talk to your dad? Uh, yeah. He's over here. Mr. Axelrod. I've got a story that I think you should run on TV. Jason Ross, hard-hitting investigative reporter. What do you got, scoop? This. Mm-hmm. Buck McHenry. Star pitcher of the Negro Leagues. Great player. No story. Sorry, kiddo. How about this? Buck McHenry is Aaron's grandpa-- when he was younger. Mr. Henry? Yes. You're saying that Buck McHenry was hiding under the name Mack Henry for 40 years sweeping floors? Not very likely. He had to hide because of the scrape with the law. Some people think he's dead, but they're wrong. Jason, even Aaron says it's not him. Why don't you believe him? Because I've got proof. According to the Internet, Buck McHenry was born in Valdosta, Georgia. Mr. Henry told me this morning that he was born in Valdosta, Georgia. Yeah, well, lots of people are born in Valdosta, Georgia. McHenry. Mack Henry. Well, it's interesting, but it's a guess. What's your hard proof? My proof is he knows stuff about the Negro Leagues that only someone in the Negro Leagues would know about. Like what? Like Satchel Paige never had his own soap 'cause he was too cheap. He was always using Mr. Henry's soap. That's not in any book, and that's not on the Internet. Hmm. A baseball immortal hiding among us. It's a great story if it's true. It's got mystery, intrigue, human interest-- a real ratings grabber. I'm gonna hang onto this and do some researching of my own. Meanwhile, you guys have practice tomorrow, right, and Mr. Henry's gonna be there? - Uh-huh. - How about I pay you a little visit? Cool. Bring a camera crew with me, huh? Just in case Mr. Henry wants to do a little talking about his past. Yes! Good stuff, scoop. - Thanks. - All right. See you tomorrow. [cheering] Mr. Henry: Would somebody please tell me what's going on here? Chuck Axelrod, sir. Kim's dad. I know who you are, Mr. Axelrod, but what's the camera for? Oh, well, I just wanted to get some footage of your team playing. Team? We're not a team. Just three players. [boys shouting] Woo, yeah! Kim: What are they doing here? Jason: I told Tug we needed some guys today. Looks like we've got enough kids for a game now, Chuck. But not enough for two teams. Well, it's not a real game, Mr. Henry. We just need some baseball action to cover the narration for a TV show. We could split up the teams. I don't want to play on their team. Do you, Aaron? We can beat them with just us. Yeah, right. You gonna strike everyone out, Aaron? If I gotta. - Yeah, right! - You're not good enough. Satchel Paige once called in his whole outfield so that he could strike out a side. And he did! You're still living in a house of cards, Jase-- baseball cards. [laughing] Say that after we beat you. Yeah, right. Where are you from, anyway? Memphis. Yeah? You any good? Yeah. We won the league last year. Ooh. Did you start? Yeah. [boys jeering] I want to help these kids build a team. And if other kids see this on TV, maybe they'll come out and join the Stadium Sluggers. You want to do a TV show about us on a practice session? You bet, and end it by advertising for players on your team. But you can't play three against nine. The kids want to, Chuck. That's the story. David and Goliath. You coach David. [chuckles] I coach David. All right. So I'll coach Goliath, too, since he's the one with the losing record. Good line. [chuckles] All right, listen up. There's a camera on the field, but I don't want you to pay any attention to that. I want you to play, and play hard. All right, team. Let's play some ball. Yeah, as if that old guy knows anything about real baseball. He knows more than you ever did. He was-- You'll see. All right, all right. What are you standing around for? You guys want to be movie stars or you want to be baseball players? You can hurt you arm just as much in a fake game as you can in a real game. Now, come on, get out there and warm up. Come on, loosen it up. Come on. Come on! Don't show them anything yet. You bring your sponge? Are you kidding? Three. Three against nine. Yeah, right. Chuck: Batter up. Batter, batter, batter. - Ow! - Strike one. What an arm! That kid's got heat. Come on, you can hit them! Be tough out there! [grunts] Strike two. Strike two, no way! It's okay. Hit this one. Strike three! Did you see that? I can't believe it. This guy's incredible! Good swing on a good pitch. Come on, Tug! You're out of there. - Come on. Big 2-0. - Don't let him psych you out! Hit a home run! [grunts] Strike one. Move back in the box, Tug. Strike three. Okay, team. Come on in. Kim, you're up. Hey, Mr. Henry. Can she hit? Well, if I was you, I'd back up. Jason: Go! Go! Come on, Kim! Go, Kim, go! - Slide! - Safe! Jason: Yes! You should've backed up. Jase, I can't let you win. You know that, don't you? Getting worried, Tugger? Hot coals, Jason. Hot coals. Yeah. Safe! Ball one. Kim: Hey, pitcher, throw something he can hit. Ball two. Terrific. You're going to walk him, and we have no more batters. Time. Are you afraid to pitch to him? I don't have to. We just load the bases and they're stuck, right? I don't want to win like that. Tug, this thing's gonna be on TV. You want to win like that on TV? Fine. You're the captain. Boys: Come on, guys! You're a good man, Tug. We'll see. Play ball. [boys shouting] Mr. Henry: Yeah! Yeah! [laughing] Let's call it. Jason: We did it, guys! Hey, how about that? Are we a team, or aren't we? Oh, Mr. Henry, would you mind stepping here for a moment? I thought you guys had left already. Well, I thought I'd stick around to catch a moment alone with you. What for? Jason has this idea that you might be Buck McHenry from the old Negro Leagues. Jason's on that again, is he? He made a pretty convincing case, sir. Convincing enough for me to bring a camera crew out here. I'm still doing some research, but I think we're pretty much ready to go. You set, Joe? Count to three and go, Chuck. One, two, three. This is the story of one man's true identity. The story-- Sorry, sir. - I was just trying-- - I don't want any part of this. That's him, Brad. Buck McHenry. Hi, Dad. Jason and I came to see ourselves on TV. Just came to see if you got my good side. No problem. Where's Aaron? His grandpa said he had to go home. Oh, that's too bad. This is going to be a great story. All right, start it up. Well, the game's over, but not our story. By now, you may be wondering who the man was that coached these teams. e knew what he was doing, andH here's a good reason for it.t You see, a long time ago, there was a man named Buck McHenry, a famous right-handed pitcher from... Oh, there's the card. ...who mysteriously disappeared out of sight. Why? What caused him to disappear? Well, tomorrow, we'll explore the fascinating mystery of Buck McHenry, and what leads me to believe that he's been working for many years as a school custodian under the name Mack Henry. Stay tuned. So, you gonna get an interview with this guy? I don't know yet. Chuck, are you sure about him being who he was? Well, I've contacted my sources in Valdosta, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them. But my gut tells me he's him. Okay, hotshot. Go for it. Maybe he wants his privacy, Dad. Honey, he's a public figure. Mr. Henry will like being famous again, everybody knowing how great he was. Jason, you just make sure you warn him that he might become a celebrity again. Because if the story checks out, I'm gonna run it this week. [knocking on door] Door's open. Come on in. Oh, hi, Mrs. Henry. Oh, well, well. Mr. Jason Ross. This is my friend, Kim Axelrod. - Hello, Kim. - Hi. What can I do for you two? Is Mr. Henry home, or Aaron? Well, they've gone to the store. What's going on? Great things. My dad found out that Mr. Henry was once the great Buck McHenry and he's going to say so this week on TV. Well, who's Buck McHenry? Buck McHenry was one of the greatest pitchers in the old Negro Leagues. What's that go to do with my husband? He is your husband. You knew that, didn't you? Jason, I don't have a husband named Buck McHenry. We know about the trouble he had down south, with the law? And that's why he changed his name from Buck McHenry to Mack Henry. My dad's checked his sources. It's okay, though. You don't have to worry. My dad's a lawyer. Any scrape with the law that Mr. Henry had is history. I mean, the warrant's probably outdated, anyway. Warrant? Now, you two just hold on. This has gone far enough. I have been married to Mack Henry for over 40 years. I think I would know his name by now. Good heavens! Mr. Henry's been working since he was 8 years old when his father died, picking peaches, canning fish, sweeping floors. I mean, when was he going to find time to be some famous baseball player? Now, those baseball cards are messing with your mind. Mr. Henry is an ordinary man, perhaps too ordinary for you, Jason Ross, but that's what he is. And if your father runs those stories about warrants and baseball players, well, there could be consequences that could cost my husband his job at the school. Is that what you want, Jason? No, ma'am. Well, that's what could happen, and for no good reason. So he's really not Buck McHenry? Mr. Henry is Mr. Henry. That's all he is. Oh, no. We made a mistake. You most certainly did. Now, what are you going to do about it? Maybe we can get my dad to stop the story. I'm really sorry, Mrs. Henry. Don't be sorry, Jason. Go fix it. [door opens] [door closes] I'm just waiting to hear back from Valdosta, that's all. But she says it's not him. Either that lady knows who he is and is afraid to admit it, or she doesn't know, but he's Buck. I feel it in my bones, Kim. The public has a right to know. And stories this great don't grow on trees. So as soon as I can verify the facts of this thing, that old custodian's going to be famous. Don't look so grim, Jason. You've done him a favor. After tomorrow night's broadcast, Mack Henry can throw away his broom forever. Have you learned anything from this, Jason? Have you possibly learned that just because you want something doesn't make it right? Do you see what you've done to this man, Mr. Henry? To his wife? Isn't there some way to help him, Tom? To stop this broadcast? How? I think Jason's baseball cards and his fantasy life have finally caught up with reality in a big way. Thanks a lot, Dad. Thanks a real lot. Jason! Mom: Jason? Jason! Tom! Jason, stop it. Stop it! Let me go! I understand, now. You were right and I was wrong, okay? I know that now. But all you keep saying is I told you so. How does that help? Huh, Dad? How does that help? Listen to him, Tom. Please. What about Mr. Henry? I never meant to hurt him. I'm so sorry. I know you are, son. I know you are. Help me. Well, I want to, Jason. I just--I don't know how. We can go to the Negro League Museum in Kansas City. Aw, Jason, there you go again. Dad, you're a lawyer. I bet we could find some proof to help Mr. Henry. Maybe there's still time. Just fly to Kansas City, just like that? No, we could use my cards to buy the tickets. Here. Griffey Jr.'s rookie card. But Jason, you saved for over a year for that. Take it, Dad. Please! He's got a perfect swing. It's a thing of beauty, Dad. Why don't you hang on to this? I've got lots of frequent flyer miles. Thanks, Dad. You're going to be all right, Jason. Thing of beauty. Thanks. Keep the change. Thanks. Now, where's the entrance? He said it was that way. Oh, there it is. Negro League Museum. Announcer on TV: In the course of that period, several thousand ball players in all leagues are alternately booed and cheered by spectators who sit in the stands eating millions of hot dogs, drinking millions of bottles of soda pop, and munching millions of bags of peanuts and popcorn. Even the lovely ladies flock to the parks to boo and cheer. Yes, there's no doubt about it. Baseball is king. It's a sport that appeals to all ages, to all groups. The sound of a ball meeting a bat is a familiar ring to millions of people around the world. Mr. Cole, I appreciate you seeing us on such short notice. Not a problem. This is my son, Jason. - Hi. - Hi, Jason. Said you needed some urgent information on Buck McHenry. That's right. What can you tell us about him? Well, as I told Jim Davis on the phone, unfortunately, Buck McHenry's dead. He passed a long time ago. How do you know? Ollie Johnston told me. He's a local business man and was a friend of McHenry's, a friend of a lot of the old Negro League players. He used to arrange barnstorming tours for them after their season was over. How did he know Buck McHenry was dead? He buried him. Good afternoon. Woman: Hello. We're looking for Mr. Ollie Johnston. He's inside. Follow me, please. Thank you, Mrs. Moody. I'm Ollie Johnston. Tom Ross. This is my son Jason. Nice to meet you. Would you care to join me? Dad, look. Josh Gibson... and Bullet Rogan. Ollie: Do you know about them? Sort of. I know stuff about Josh Gibson. He hit a ball out of Yankee Stadium. Babe Ruth couldn't even do that. If you pitch Gibson inside, it is gone. Satchel Paige, Dad. Was he really as good as they said? Better. That's Hilton Smith. He pitched the same time Satchel pitched for the Kansas City Monarchs. He threw a heavy ball. Satchel threw a light ball. Just a fabulous pitcher. And that's Judy Johnson there-- A tremendous person, a great player, very nice guy. Over here is Hank Aaron when he played for the Indianapolis Clowns. Up on the wall over there is Roy Campanella. Great catcher, tremendous hitter. Behind us here is Ted Radcliffe. Jason: They used to call him "Double Duty" Radcliffe. Tom: Great name. They were just tremendous players. Over here is Jackie Robinson. I knew Jackie when he first came to the Kansas City Monarchs. Over here is my real good friend, "Cool Papa" Bell. He was so fast, he could circle the bases in 11 seconds. Mr. Johnston, I understand that you knew Buck McHenry. I knew Buck McHenry real well. Would you take a seat? I have his card. It says something about a scrape with the law? What's that about? I was there when it happened. Buck was barnstorming with my team down south and we were just playing for small change losing to white semi-pro teams, teams that we could've beat with our hands tied behind us. One game, Buck was on the mound and this white player bunted a ball down the first base line. Buck came over to field the ball. This white player spiked Buck on his right leg, all the way down. It was a long, deep gash. I mean he really rubbed those spikes into Buck's right leg. It was like a jagged bolt of lightning. He spiked him on purpose? He did it on purpose. Buck jumped up, and pow, hit this white player in the jaw. What happened next? What do you think happened then when a black man breaks a white man's jaw in the south? Listen, Jason. A riot breaks out. We all ran for our lives. The sheriff put a warrant out for Buck's arrest. I seriously doubt that an assault warrant issued 50 years ago would still be outstanding. It doesn't matter. Buck is long dead. Well, that's what we've been told, and as a matter of fact, that's why we came to see you, Mr. Johnston. We need some proof of that. You say you buried him. I wonder if you'd mind signing a statement to that effect. I'll sign a statement to that effect. Thank you. I'd appreciate it. Buck was a great player and a true friend. That's a combination that's hard to find. Buck would give you the shirt off his back. You understand that, son? Yes, sir. Jason, we've saved Mr. Henry a public embarrassment, but I want you to know I realize how hard it is to see a dream die. I'm okay, Dad. Thank you. Aaron, is your grandfather home? No. And he doesn't want to see you, and neither do I. Aaron, it's important. Please. Yeah, maybe for you. Aaron, you gotta listen to me. My dad and I went to Kansas City. We know that your grandfather's not Buck McHenry. The real Buck McHenry's dead. We've got proof. You mean you went all the way to Kansas City to help my grandpa? I wanted to. I didn't mean for this to happen, Aaron, and I have to make this right with your grandfather. You gotta trust me. He's gone fishing. Come on. Mr. Henry. I just want to tell you how sorry I am for these past few days. Everything's going to be okay, grandpa. Is it? Yes, I came down here to tell you that I know I was wrong. I know you're not Buck McHenry. Jason and his dad went to Kansas City yesterday, Grandpa. They got proof that Buck McHenry's passed. We saw his grave. We're going to be okay. Except you just hooked a tree, Grandpa. That I did. I'm gonna go meet my dad down at the TV station. We're gonna get Chuck Axelrod to stop that false story. That's good news. All right. So... What's the matter, Jason? Never seen a man's legs before? Buck McHenry had a scar on his right leg. A big one, like a jagged bolt of lightning. Aaron, look. You're him! You really are him, aren't you? You're still talking nonsense, ain't you, boy? Jason, I don't understand. In Kansas City, a man named Ollie Johnston told us that Buck McHenry had been badly spiked on his right leg. We saw your grave. It said you died too soon. Well, I guess they were right about that, 'cause I'm still here. Grandpa, are you him? Are you Buck McHenry? No. Not now. But once upon a time, I was Buck McHenry. But you were a great ball player, and you quit to sweep floors? I don't get it. Aaron... you know what it was like when you lost your mommy and your daddy? The pain? Well, there's a pain that's almost as bad as that one-- Black man's pain. You know, always losing when you know you could win. Always being treated as less than a man. Jackie Robinson could turn the other cheek, but I couldn't. I mean, the time comes when a man has to just stand up and say, "That is enough!" And that's what I did. But why didn't you tell us? I didn't tell anybody about my used to be life. I didn't even tell your grandma. She still doesn't know. I think you should tell her. You really think so? I been hiding the truth for a long, long time. It's gonna feel good to get it off my chest. You nervous about what she'll say? Maybe so, but she's never, ever let me down. Aaron, take this from me, will you? Hey, why the long face, Kimmy? Hmm? It's a great night for your dad. It's a great night for our ratings. I just hope your story doesn't embarrass Mr. Henry too much. He doesn't have anything to be embarrassed about, hon. We're telling the truth. Buck McHenry lives and breathes right in our very own backyard. Now that is great stuff, Chuck. It would be if it were true. You've got your facts wrong, Mr. Axelrod. Buck McHenry is dead. Well, I beg to differ. We dug up Mr. Henry's old custodian photos from 40 years ago and faxed them to Valdosta. They confirmed he's the man. I'm going to tell the viewers Mr. Henry's real story. That's why I'm here. I want to speak for myself. He wants to do your show. Well, then, sir, I guess you and I have a date with history. That's fine with me. I think it's time somebody told history like it really was. And here's Chuck Axelrod with the day in sports. Thanks, Kath. Tonight is a big night in sports, for I'm about to reveal the story behind one Mr. Mack Henry, a local high school custodian with a hidden past. There's a story behind this man, a story that could only take place in America. For once upon a time, this man, was this man-- Buck McHenry, star pitcher in the old Negro Leagues. He won 90 games in three years. Baseball historians say he could have been as good at the great Satchel Paige. Grandma, he was better than Satchel Paige! ...disappeared from baseball, and apparently off the face of the earth, until tonight. uck McHenry,B nown to thousandsk f school childreno s Mack Henry,a chool custodian,s has agreed to be with us in person and to reveal why for more than 40 years, one of baseball's greatest players suddenly vanished from sight. Welcome to "Sports Line", Mr. Henry. Thank you, Mr. Axelrod. Or do I call you by your real name, Buck? Buck, Mack. Both of them's me, so either one will do. What happened to Buck McHenry? It says on your card that you mysteriously-- It's really him. Yep. Do you dare comment on that? It wasn't about a scrape with the law. It was about how colored players were treated back in those days. We have some footage from those old days. Announcer: In the course of that period, several thousand ball players... I used to play with some of those boys. I imagine you did. And struck out a lot of them, too. Yeah. Quite a few. Back then, after the season was over, we'd barnstorm sometimes through small towns in the south playing the local teams-- white boys, mostly farmers. And fans would pay a dollar to see the local team beat the daylights out of the black professional players. So you're saying you threw games for money? No, I'm saying that if we wanted to be invited back, we lost. Must have been hard to lose. Yeah, make it look convincing. It was. And then, one day, the fans got ugly. They really got nasty. It was all my fault. How? Well, they started out throwing things, calling us names. "Go back to Africa!" "Your daddy and granddaddy still hanging from trees!" "Coon!" Nigger? Yeah, even that. Till, finally, I got fed up. I couldn't take it anymore, so instead of striking out, like I was supposed to do, I hit a homerun. A grand slam! Next inning, they made me pay for it. That's why he spiked him, Dad, because he wouldn't sell out like they wanted him to. He had guts. Has guts. Chuck: So you got spiked. You fought back. There was a riot. You took off. That's all perfectly understandable, Mr. Henry, but what made you disappear forever and sweep floors for 40 years? Mr. Axelrod, do you know how it feels to hit a man and break his jaw? No. To jump on that man, throw him on the ground, put your hands around his throat and squeeze him because you want to kill him and you would do that except that your friends pull you off and say, "Run! Run!" That's what you ran from. Yeah. I swore I'd never touch a baseball again. For a long time I didn't... till three youngsters, kids, went looking for a coach and found me. One of them is my daughter. Kim, yeah. She's about the best that we got out there. And Aaron, my grandson? Pitcher, man. And Jason Ross. Oh, Jason. He Sherlock Holmes'd me into remembering who I was. Up to that time, nobody knew but me and Ollie. Not even my wife. Oh, Mack. My darling. They brought something back to life in me that I thought was dead-- my love for baseball. I think baseball is the finest game that mankind has ever invented. And I am Mack Henry, coach of the Stadium Sluggers. And as long as those kids want me to coach, that's what I intend to do. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think you'll agree with me that we met a legend tonight, a genuine hero. Buck McHenry. No kidding. Star pitcher of the old Negro Leagues. Wow. And Mack Henry, school custodian. And I thank you, sir. Thank you. Very much. So if you're 12 years old and you want to play baseball under a great coach-- You okay, Grandma? Oh, I'm so proud of him, Aaron. So proud. Me, too. [ringing] Woman on answering machine: You've reached "Sports Line". All our lines are busy, so please leave a message at the tone. [ringing] Hello? The coach? Well, Mr. Henry didn't get back home yet. Yes, please. Call back tomorrow. Well, what was that? [ringing] Hello? No, I'm sorry. He's not in. Uh, okay. Um, hang on, just let me get your-- Yeah. An outfielder. Can I put you on hold for a sec? Yeah. Jim's Stadium Sports Cards. Second base. Second base, yeah. That's be great. - Let me just put you on hold. - [phone ringing] Thanks. Bye. [phone ringing] Hello? Uh, yes, that's right, it was on television. Yeah, sure. I'll have him call you tomorrow. Thank you. Bye. [phone ringing] Hello? Coach Henry? [cheering] Yeah! Now these last awards go to three amazing young people, who, against all odds, brought this team into being. And those pretty darn good baseball players are? Kim Axelrod, shortstop and All-Star team. Chuck: That's my girl! Yeah! Proud of you. Aaron. Aaron Henry, pitcher and MVP of the 12-year-old league. Kim: All right, Aaron! Hang on to that card, man. That is going to be worth something some day. And finally, Jason Ross, our catcher and the founder of the Stadium Sluggers baseball team. Woo! You all know I sell legends on paper. But today, well, all I can say is I am very proud to know a real one-- Buck McHenry. And to present his baseball card, we have a surprise guest. Mr. Johnston. Ollie. Oliver Johnston. This is Mr. Ollie Johnston. He buried Buck McHenry, and me and my dad dug him up. I did my best to hide you, Buck. You did fine, Ollie. We just didn't know who we were up against. Buck, why don't you come up and join me? It's really good to see you. Good to see you! So good to see you. Mr. Johnston, read the stat side. Ollie: Stats. There were no stats in the Negro Leagues. Did you all know that? No stats. Gosh, this is a very unusual card. There's a picture on both sides. It says Buck McHenry, pitcher, Negro League All-Star. Mack Henry, coach of the Stadium Sluggers baseball team. Woo! Buck McHenry. Mack Henry. Buck McHenry. Buck. Mack. Buck. Mack. Buck. Mack. [chanting] Buck. Mack. Buck. Mack. Buck. Mack. Buck. Mack. Buck. Mack. [chanting continues] [cheering] Aaron: Yeah, grandpa!
