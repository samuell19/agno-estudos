(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) VIRGINIA: (SHOUTING IN PANIC) Hello! Please! Someone, help me! (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS, WHINES) VIRGINIA: (GASPING IN TERROR) Hello! (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS, WHINES) Hello? (SHUTTER CLICKS, WHINES) (DEEP METALLIC SCREECH) (GASPS) Oh. (SOBS) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Welcome to the Murder Castle. VIRGINIA: "Murder Castle"? No. No, no, no, no! (BANGING) Please! Please! Let me out! (GAS HISSING) (COUGHING, GASPING) (COUGHING, CHOKING) (METALLIC SLICING, STATIC) (GASPS) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR SLAMS) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOT ECHOES) (SIREN ECHOES) (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (PLANE ENGINE DRONING) ALEC: Hi, we're about to land. Anyway, uh, we love you and miss you, and, uh, tell you what, I'll FaceTime you later when the whole family's around, okay? Bye. (BEEP) Livie, your seatbelt. What the hell, Mom? Seatbelt. Yeah. Earbuds. Couldn't hear you. No reason to physically assault me. (SCOFFS) Don't be so dramatic. Okay, okay, relax, you two. Nobody died. Wonder what time Cam and Tara get in? CAM: When you meet my grandfather, try not to be nervous. 'Cause, I mean, I totally understand if you are nervous-- (TARA SIGHS) He can be super intimidating, but, you know... I really wish you would've met him before the accident. He was like a legendary bad-ass in a suit. He was like Clint Eastwood and Bruce Wayne rolled into one. I mean, when I was a baby, when I was a little kid, he used to pick me up with one hand-- This has nothing to do with him. It's nausea... not nerves. Oh. The waves? TARA: I'm seasick. (WAVES CRASHING) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Tell me your dad didn't buy a whole freaking island. (THUNDER RUMBLING) MARIE: It would be so him. ALEC: He doesn't control the money. We just bought him a house, that's all. "We"? Kyle... prefers not to deal with him, so he just signed off on whatever Dad wanted. LIVIE: Why do you even care? Because it's wasteful. You know, building a dream house at his age? Grandpa Ellison is a sickly old man. Who's earned the right to do whatever he wants. It's not your money, so, don't worry about it. Really? Uh, thanks! (MUSIC CONTINUES) ALEC: This is pretty cool, huh? (MARIE CHUCKLES) ALEC: The house, it's, um... It's bizarre. It's Victorian. ALEC: Actually, it's kind of Gothic. LIVIE: Grandpa! (DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLING) (CHUCKLES) Hey. Hey, kiddo. Hi! It's been too long. Great to see you, Ellison. (CROWS CAWING) Happy birthday. Aw, thank you. MARIE: 80's a... it's a big one. Yeah. Appreciate you coming out. Alec. Hello, Dad. Wouldn't miss it for the world. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm just sorry Mom isn't around to help celebrate. Fuck her for running out on us. Way to bring the fun, Dad. (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) Where's Kyle? Fuck him, too. (LAUGHS) He'll be here soon. Come inside and get yourselves situated. ELLISON: Yeah, see what you-- See what you paid your money for. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) Wow! This is so wow, Grandpa. Definitely not what I expected. Yeah, took just 18 months and a lot of hard work, and the invaluable help from, uh, from Burnham here. It was a team effort. Couldn't have done it without you. My masterpiece. (CHAIR BUZZING) Best thing I ever did. Besides having children, right? What? (GRUNTS) Follow me, Livie. Allow me. (SIGHS) ELLISON: Here. (LIVIE GASPS) Holy shit. ALEC: What the-- (CHUCKLES) Grandpa, this is so cool. Oh, my God. This is... definitely something. It's remarkable! Hon, look at these chandeliers. You must've had this stuff flown in from all around the world. Look at this piece over here. Yeah. MARIE: The ceiling's... There's another one over there, look. See? Right there. You see it? Look. Grandpa, I love it. Yeah, that's something, isn't it? Mm-hmm. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) What's this building? Oh, yeah. That's the old post office. That's where our first pharmacy was, before it burned to the ground in a fire. ELLISON: Wrong! Bought the property after a fire. Flipped it to the city, made back ten times my money, and that's how I financed my first pharmacy. That's shrewd. Yeah. (CAT MEOWS) LIVIE: Hello. (CAT PURRING) Pretty kitty. Cats and dogs? That's new. (CAT MEOWS) She's a stray. You can learn a lot from animals. BURNHAM: (OVER INTERCOM) Your room is ready. (DARK MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, the accommodations are great, Pop. MARIE: This place is enormous. You could rent it out as a hotel, or a bed and breakfast. Something to look forward to when I get old. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (DOGS BARKING) Those damn dogs. Burnham? (STATIC NOISE) BURNHAM: (OVER INTERCOM) I've got it, sir. Someone's coming. Let's go see, huh? (GROWLING MENACINGLY) (GASPS) (DOGS BARKING VICIOUSLY) (GROWLING) (BLOWS DOG WHISTLE) (WHINES) It's okay now! I promise! (DOGS WHINING) Fuck. I think I shit myself. Not literally, but... (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SIGHS) Hey, Mom. MARIE: Hey, honey. Good to see you. ALEC: Terrific. Dad. The gang's all here. You bet. Wow, including significant others. CAM: Yeah, well, you could've brought your boyfriend-- oh, wait, you've never had one, 'cause you're gross. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Nice. Be nice. Grandpa, happy birthday. Cut your hair, cut your hair. Okay, I will. Happy birthday, Mr. Betts. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Are you okay? Oh, me? (SCOFFS) I'm good. This is gonna be great. We haven't been together in so long. It's overdue. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Are you sure? Absolutely. How about you? Is it weird? No. I mean, I have to meet them sooner or later. Besides Ellison, you'll meet my brother. His wife-- now, she's a piece of work. I mean, she's a great mom, but she runs his life like it's a fuckin' boot camp... and then there's the kids-- They're not really kids anymore. Cam must be 23, and then there's Livie. She's kind of a smart-ass, but great. No, no, no. It's... It's gonna be great. (CHUCKLES) It's going to be weird. Yeah. Super weird. Are you going to tell them about us? Let's get through one day with my dad. See how it goes. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (ENGINE WINDING DOWN) KYLE: Stand by. We'll call when we're ready to leave. Hey, everyone. I'd like you to meet Joy. Joy... this is my family. My big brother Alec, his wife Marie, his daughter Livie... their son Cam, and his...? Girlfriend. Tara. LIVIE: Hmm. Quite the entrance, bro. I thought you'd like that. Hi, Tara. (QUIETLY) Welcome to Hell... (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) And of course, the man, the myth, the legend... my dad, Ellison. Happy birthday, Pop. Kyley. It's a pleasure to meet all of you, and especially you, Mr. Betts. Happy birthday. Oh, you're... You're a lovely one. But I gotta question your judgment if you've seen fit to be with my son. He's a fucking bloodsucker. So, it begins. Gramps, be nice. He stole my company right out from under me. Like a thief in the night. I, uh, did not know that. I'm just saying this 'cause I care-- Watch out for him. JOY: Bloodsucker, huh? Uh-huh. Ain't that what you call a backstabbing thief who... sucks the life out of you? KYLE: Really? Is it? 'Cause I'd say what I did was save the family business and rescue this empire that you nearly drove into the ground ten years ago. Oh, yes. Our mighty savior comes down from on high to grace us with his presence. You're welcome. ELLISON: Oh... fuck you. Well, that didn't take long. Oh, don't be so sensitive. I'm just horsing around. I'm kidding. Yeah, get your jokes in now. Joy and I are on the clock. Uh, meaning what? Can't stay for the weekend, Pop. Too much work. Oh. Well, let's go in, then. Come on. I'll take you in to see the house. LIVIE: We gave you so much advance notice. Don't be like that. (EXHALES) I'm sorry, kiddo. Gotta keep the cash flowing in for your trust fund. Kyle, is all that necessary? Oh, you get used to it. No, we don't get used to it. Come on, everyone. This is a time for celebration. Can we please drop all the negativity? Exactly. When was the last time we were all together? Actually, without my sister Virginia, we are not all together, are we? Oh, I thought we weren't supposed to mention Aunt Virgie around Gramps. Yeah, too late. It's fine. She couldn't make it, but she sends her regards. Hello, Burnham. Nice. Does anyone else have anything to say that's uncomfortable, taboo, or full-on hateful? No, I think we're good. (CHUCKLES) Who's hungry? I'm hungry. I'm always hungry. Let's do it. (PERKY MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) ELLISON: Follow me. LIVIE: Here you go. Oh. Okay, ready? My hands don't work so good, honey. LIVIE: Ta-da. This one's from me. ELLISON: Oh, thank you. Thank you, sweetheart. Snazzy. Yeah. Anyone want more wine? Now, you are speaking my language. Kitchen? Gotcha. JOY: Okay. Now, everyone, take a pause and don't open anything until we get back. Love you. Who's ruling the roost here? Marie? Huh? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Oh, good for you. Okay. (GRUNTS) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (MEOWS) (CHUCKLES) Cute. Hmm. So, how long have you and Kyle been... Together? Yeah. Four months last week. Young love. Now, that's cute. (MEOWS) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (CAT MEOWS) (MEOWS) (MEOWING) Joy: Decisions, decisions... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) What drew you to him? To Kyle? Lots of things. He's sweet. Loving. The most caring man I've ever met. Does that surprise you? Let's just say the Kyle I know is more snake oil than sweetheart. Yeah, I guess you just don't know him the way I do. (CAT YOWLING, SCREECHING) (GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (CAT YOWLING IN PAIN, BODY CRUNCHING) (GARBAGE DISPOSAL CHURNING, CRUNCHING) (SCREAMING IN HORROR) Oh, my God! (SCREAMING) (GARBAGE DISPOSAL TURNS OFF) Oh, Jesus! CAM: What's going on? What the fuck? ALEC: Oh, my God! Hello? What's going on in here? The cat died, Pop. ELLISON: Oh... well, isn't that a-- that's a shame. I was always concerned the dog's were gonna get it. (CHUCKLES) I'll have Burnham clean this up. We're having trouble with some of the wiring in the kitchen. That's fucking disgusting. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (OWL HOOTING) Any more? Who's next? Hmm? Last one, Pop. From Joy and I. Happy birthday. ELLISON: Last one. Well... as you know... I'm not one to pontificate. I hate speeches. I'm not much for... ceremony altogether. I'm a modest man... from humble beginnings. You've all-- you all heard the story before. (SOFT TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Well, Joy hasn't. I do my research. Oh? Okay. Okay. Let's see. Ellison J. Betts-- self-made billionaire. Your parents died when you were little. Went from the orphanage to the boardroom. Built a very successful chain... of regional pharmacies, ultimately taking Betts national. One of the great American success stories. Am I close? ELLISON: Too close. Maybe you're the real bloodsucker. (CHUCKLES) JOY: Maybe. Watch out for me. ELLISON: I will. No, but honestly, it's really impressive what you accomplished there, Mr. Betts. Ah, if it wasn't for the accident... I could've done something really special. Really cemented my legacy. Oh, well, you did okay, Pop. Better than okay, and everything's still in good hands with Kyle. (WHISPERS) Thank you. ELLISON: Anyway... I... I'd like to thank you all for coming, and for, uh, honoring me with all of this, and if I could impart one bit of advice as my gift to you all, it would be... to learn your history. It's the only way to be true to who you really are. (FIRE CRACKLING) Uh, what did he get you, Grandpa? ELLISON: Livie, help me. (GRUNTS) I can't... Oh, yeah, that's smart, man. Real smart. I have no use for this, absolutely no use for this. I'll have it. (BOX CLOSES) ELLISON: Is that it? Are we done? I am. You ready, Joy? Mm. (SCOFFS) What, you can't get out of here fast enough? Wow, Marie. You're so invested in my itinerary. That warms my heart. Come on, brother. You're not seriously leaving? I mean, tomorrow's Saturday. I'm sorry, Alec. I got meetings and such. MARIE: (CHUCKLES) "And such"? Whoa! That sounds serious. KYLE: Well, Marie... (SIGHS) ...it's not the P.T.A. bake-a-thon, but some of us have real-world obligations. Well, maybe if you looked after Alec, he could've helped you with the business, instead of it being all on you. Okay. All right, Marie. Thank you. I do not need you to defend me, okay? (SCOFFS) You don't? No, he doesn't. You know, Alec, you should listen to her, 'cause she's right, I'm the problem. If he wants to go, let him fuck off. Hey! You fuck off! Don't you sit there in that chair and pretend that you want me here! We both know that's bullshit. Hey, listen. What is this about, huh? Is this about me and Dad going places without you when we were kids? Fucking get over it. You tell him to get over it! He fucking brought it up. Asshole. You know what, Joy? I'm so happy that you came this evening to get the full Betts experience, because we just love each other to death! You're welcome. Hmm. Oh, cool. Look. There's another gift. ALEC: Oh. KYLE: Oh, great. Maybe it's a family therapist. (CHUCKLES) Well, who's it from? It doesn't say. Hey, open it. You-- You-- You open it. Okay. That's the spirit. What do you say, Livie, you and I? For the sake of solidarity? LIVIE: Sure. MARIE: Sure that's a good idea? Mystery gift? No name? Better-than-even chance that it explodes. (CHUCKLES) LIVIE: Nice. Someone finally has a sense of humor. Well, you got it from someone. Touché. On the count of three? Okay. One... two... three! (ROARS) Boom! (GASPING) God! Dad! You see? I'm funny. Yeah, he's got my sense of humor. (CHUCKLES) (CAM GRUNTING) What is it? I don't know. It's heavy. (CLASPS CLACK OPEN) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) LIVIE: Ooh. "Welcome to Dangerous Game." "An immersive murder mystery where you are the detective." Ah. LIVIE: "Examine the clues and physical evidence to solve the mystery." "Find the killer... and win the game." Hmm. Cool. CAM: It looks legit. Autopsy reports, witness statements... Crime scene photos? What kind of gift is this? So, it's like an elevated board game. Actually, their ads keep showing up in my feed. Super hip. Yeah, but who got this for him? It sounds like a hoot. Let's-- Let's play. You gotta be kidding me. It looks sick. God, it's just a game. What's the matter? Big-shot CEO hasn't got the stomach for it? Huh? Hey, Gramps. Be nice. Fuck nice. You know what? Have at it. I'm out of here. Enjoy your creepy fucking board game. Bye. JOY: Kyle... KYLE: Bye. One sec. (GLASS CLINKS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Kyle? Can I talk to you for a moment? What? I think you should stay. No. I'm serious. So am I. JOY: You know, if I didn't have my sister's wedding shower, I would stay, but you really should. You should. Why? Because a cat getting liquefied isn't a bad enough omen? Spend the weekend with my dad? You don't know the half of it with him. Spending 48 hours with that son of a bitch, I'm gonna want to commit patricide. Yes, your dad is a cantankerous old man, but look, he's from another time. I mean, the man was once a captain of industry, now he's stuck in a wheelchair and living all alone. Yeah, well, you know what? Karma's a bitch. Regardless, he's not going to be around forever. Thank God. For their sake, you need to make an effort. That's your family. Christ. Okay, I'll stick around, but just to make sure that none of my family get turned into fucking soup. (CHUCKLES) ALEC: Kyle? Say goodbye to Pop. He's turning in for the night. Aw, geez, what, no creepy board game? Well, tomorrow. He-- He's getting sleepy. I wanna make sure I got my wits about me. (CHUCKLES DRYLY) I thought you were leaving. Yeah, about that-- quick update. Joy has to go back, but I'm gonna stay for the weekend, keep the party going. That's what I'm talking about. Family! Wait. Hold on. You're really staying? Yes. If that's okay with you, Dad? That would be perfect. (CHUCKLES) Good. Goodnight, Grandpa. Goodnight, honey. (KYLE SIGHS) LIVIE: Hey, Mom, now that Uncle Kyle is staying, you can stop being a bitch to him. MARIE: One of these days... LIVIE: It's true. KYLE: You know what, Livie, I'm gonna buy tickets to that fight. LIVIE: Watch it. KYLE: Where's the whisky? I'm thinking something spooky. Like The Omen. (CHUCKLES) I don't think it matters what we put on. You know you're just gonna fall asleep. Because I have to conserve my energy. Because you're leaving me here on my own for the weekend with my family. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting? JOY: No. Not at all. No. ALEC: Cool. Uh... listen. I know that, um... (BURPS) ...we haven't spent much... time together in a while. You mean ever. (SCOFFS) Well... (GLASS CLINKS) ...I call B.S. on that. We invite you to hang out all the time. You did? Okay, all right, okay... (CHUCKLES) ...okay, listen. What I'm trying to say is... God knows how difficult Pop can be... and, uh, I think it's very cool that you decided to stay. Means a lot to the family. Yeah, well... someone has to call our father on his bullshit. (ALEC GULPING) (EXHALES) It's a two-man job. Uh-huh. (EXHALES) Anyhoo! (GRUNTING) Goodnight, bro-there. It was very nice to meet you, Joy. I'm sorry that you cannot stay. Likewise. Have a safe trip home. Goodnight. Goodnight, Alec. JOY: Goodnight. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) Hi. (GASPS) What the hell? (SLAMS DOOR) Your phone's getting a signal? No! Don't sneak up on me like that. It's creepy. Is it creepy? Or is it-- (MARIE CHUCKLES) You're drunk. Nope. I am not. (GLASS THUMPS) You're drunk. (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Flesh and blood... ♪ You know, it's... hard to be so optimistic when Mom and Dad are always being... you know. Mom and Dad? Alas, they are our family, and that's what's important. CAM: Right. LIVIE: Hmm. Also, they're not gonna be around forever, so... Why? Are you gonna kill them? No. Just you. Watch out for the silent ones. (CHUCKLES) Do you mean him or you? ♪ It overflows ♪ ♪ It calls me flesh and blood ♪ ♪ Flesh and blood ♪ ♪ Flesh and blood ♪ ♪ Flesh and blood ♪ (ALARM BLARING) Joy? Joy? (ALARM CONTINUES BLARING) Joy? Joy! Hey! Anyone seen Joy? Didn't she leave? I don't know. I was asleep. I heard a helicopter a couple hours ago. She probably didn't want to wake you. (SHUTTERS RATTLING LOUDLY) KYLE: Jesus Christ! ALEC: Why are the hurricane shutters coming down? CAM: How the hell do we get out of here now? TARA: Some kind of false alarm? (SHUTTERS RATTLING) What is going on, Cam? I don't know. Oh, God. (DOOR CLICKS OPEN) CAM: Jesus. The gate's shut! LIVIE: What? (SCREAMING) Stop, stop! (ALL SHOUTING IN PANIC) Dammit! TARA: No! I can't breathe! (ALARM STOPS) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Don't be alarmed. The house is secure. Join us in the great room. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Okay, well, that was fucking weird. (WHEELCHAIR HUMS) Pop, what are you doing down here? My room's down here. MARIE: Did you stop the alarm? No. Okay, well, maybe it was Burnham, then. Where is he? Yeah. Where is he? Burnham? CAM: Burnham! ALL: Burnham! Hey! Burnham! ALEC: Burnham? LIVIE: I don't see him. He's not up there. So, where is he? Hey, this is a smart house, right? Guys... look here. (DARK MUSIC PLAYING) "Wake up... and play me." Let me see that. Is this your idea of a joke? I didn't do it. No, you didn't. You're a cripple, but you had your manservant do it. Fuck off. Well, where is he? "The killer is on the loose." "Solve the puzzles to send him home." "But to win the game, only one shall remain." Okay, this is definitely a joke, right? (SIGHS) And not a funny one. Okay, well, I'm absolutely not playing now. You always were a chickenshit. Remember? We used to call you Alec "Chicky-Chicky." ♪ Chicky-Chicky Chicky-Chicky-Chicky ♪ No, Dad! That's just what you called him, and it just figures that you don't see how completely fucked up all of this is. ELLISON: You all are wound way too tight. It's just a game, after all. No, it sounds like a threat. No, maybe this is some type of team-building bonding-through-adversity thing. God knows this family could fucking use some. Livie? It's not a company retreat, okay? It's stuffy in here. Is the air on? No, the air is not on, because all the shutters are down. We need to get them open. Okay. Okay. All right. Where are the controls for the shutters? Oh, there is a secret room right over there. Just press the dragon tail under the wall lamp. (LATCH CLICKS) ALEC: "Don't go in"? LIVIE: Don't go in? You know, I've heard of immersive games, but they're usually fun. This is ridiculous. (HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING) Hmm. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You must play the game, Alec. Consider this a warning. (LEVER CLICKS) (EXPLOSION BLASTS) (ALEC SCREAMING) Fuck! (GASPS) Oh, shit! Dad! (CRASHING) (SCREAMS) LIVIE: Dad! CAM: Dad! KYLE: Alec! MARIE: Alec?

Three, two, one-- (GLASS CRUNCHING) (ALEC GROANING LOUDLY) (CRIES OUT) It said don't go in there. KYLE: Seriously? That's your reaction? (HOWLING IN SHOCK) (GASPS) I'm sorry, we've got to close the wound, or else you'll bleed out. Please, you have to stop the bleeding! He can't die. Okay, well, fuck! Somebody-- We... we should call somebody! Somebody should, like, call the police or call 9-1-1. ELLISON: There's no land line. Fuck! There's no signal, either! We don't have time for this. He's gonna bleed out. I'll grab one more. (MOANING IN PAIN) Gotta heat this up. The fireplace is electric. CAM: Why are you heating it up? Are you gonna fuckin' burn him with that thing? Half his fucking heel is blown off, Cam. I have to cauterize the wound. Alec. Alec, hey, listen to me, brother. I know this hurts like a son-of-a-bitch, this is the worst thing you've ever felt, and it's a really shitty deal that it's gonna hurt so bad, but we have to do this. Tara! It's got to be hot enough. Everyone, get ready. (PANTS) (QUIETLY) Can you do the iron? You're a nurse, right? Veterinarian school. Close enough. Okay, everyone. I'm gonna hold the leg. Marie, Livie-- get on his shoulders. Okay. KYLE: Cam, get on that leg. Okay. Make sure it doesn't shake. Okay. Have this. Bite down on this. I saw it in a movie one time. MARIE: Bite down. (YELPS IN TERROR) MARIE: Shh. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Everyone ready? CAM: Yeah. Alec? Mm-hmm. Do it. (SIZZLING) (SCREAMING) (FLESH SIZZLING, HISSING) (SCREAMING) (ALL GASPING, COUGHING) (GAGS) You did it, bro. It's okay, baby. I love you. He's passed out. Hold it up. Hold it up. Got it, got it, got it. You reach a certain pain threshold, the mind shuts down. It's natural. He'll be all right. I'm gonna get a first aid kit. Aw, Jesus, Mom. This is so fucked up. Enough of this bullshit! Look what you've done! Look at Alec! You've hobbled your son. Faulty wiring. KYLE: Oh, come on! Faulty wiring didn't blow Alec's heel off. It's your fucking game! I didn't do anything. Then who did, Dad? Livie? Cam? Marie? The fucking Man in the Moon? You're the only one capable of this. What does that mean? You know what, kid? Mind your business. Oh. Wait. Is this revenge? (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Is this what this is? Revenge for the family putting you out to pasture? ELLISON: If it was revenge, it would be on you, not the family. You stole! You robbed me of my legacy. Your legacy? Do you really want to go down that road with me, Dad? No, hold on a minute! You have no proof it was him. It could be anyone. ELLISON: Yeah, what about your girlfriend? Pretty convenient that she left, eh? Don't you dare. Yeah, what about fucking Grandpa's Alfred, huh? Where's he? LIVIE: His name's Burnham. Yeah, Burnham-- whatever the fuck his name is. Where is he? Or Virginia? Now, that we're compiling suspects. Virginia isn't here, Dad, because Virginia hates your guts. Why are you here? For revenge? Hmm? Fuck you, old man. Fuck you! Enough. We can lay blame later. Right now, we need to get out of here. Yeah. Mom's right. Fuck this, we gotta get out of here. I'm getting out of here. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) There is no escape. You must play the game. (GLASS SHATTERS) Cam, stop! There could be more traps. Stop! CAM: Yeah, I'll take my fucking chances, okay? The fucking things are meant to withstand hurricanes, dumbass! What do you suggest I do, Livie? I don't know! Do you want to play the fucking game? I don't know, maybe! The only thing we know for sure is someone wants us to play this game! So, we play the game. We play the game, we find the killer, and then we go home. What the fuck? Okay, it's ludicrous, but what other choice do we have? The only possible killer loose in this house... is Burnham. CAM: Yeah. I'm gonna fuckin' find him. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Play the game, Kyle. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) CAM: Me too. Where's that motherfucker? Burnham! MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Play the game, Cameron. (DOORKNOB CLICKS) CAM: It's locked. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) The game is afoot. Best of luck. KYLE: Burnham! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Gentlemen, there are consequences to not playing the game. (DOORKNOB RATTLING) (POUNDING) (PANTS) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) CAM: It doesn't lead anywhere. (BREATHES DEEPLY) ELLISON: So, what are we looking at here? LIVIE: Game pieces, dice. Bunch of papers. ELLISON: Of what? Case files for a bunch of victims. All women. ELLISON: Where are my glasses? TARA: Police and autopsy reports. Witness statements. A series of letters with redacted postmarks... and a few cyphers that need decoding. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Use the clues to unlock the secret inside the Cryptex, and then all will be revealed. How are we supposed to play this game? I think each one of these pieces is us. Maybe we have to roll the dice and see who picks theirs first? TARA: I don't know, it seems like the pieces are specific to us. The dog is me. I'm gonna be a vet. (DARK MUSIC PLAYING) The fireman's hat is obviously Cam. I thought he failed his test? MARIE: No, he didn't fail, he just... he got a high number. Okay... (EXHALES) ...let's see. Um, Alec is a sous chef... and Livie's a student, so... so, hers is the book. Which one is mine? The gas mask? (TAPS TANK ) Your oxygen tank. Oh. LIVIE: Mom's in the garment industry, so, this one's hers. Needle and thread. TARA: So, that means the gun is Kyle's, and... who's the noose? Kyle has a gun? Yeah. Probably for protection. Yeah. Okay. So... Now what? Are there instructions? I think the whole goal of this is to get it open. TARA: Oh, my God. There are papers on each of us, and pictures... like, like what, we're supposed to be the suspects? Wait. All of us? Jesus Christ. TARA: You, me, even Aunt Virgie and Joy. No, let me see, what does it say? Not much. It's mostly blank. Maybe we have to write in, like... alibis and motives and stuff. Oh, that's disgusting. Mom, what choice do we have? What... what are those? TARA: Those are a bunch of old photos. Over a hundred years old. New York, maybe? Chicago. Yeah. There's writing on the back. Uh, I can't read the-- LIVIE: Let me see. ...penmanship. I gotta-- Here. LIVIE: "I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing." TARA: Well, that's creepy... and poetic, I guess. I don't see how this all fits. All the victims died recently. Well, within the last 50 years. I... I don't see... I don't see how this all connects. It's all over the place. But the game's called "The Legacy Murders." So, it connects. So... let's get fucking connecting. (POUNDING, SMASHING) (GRUNTING) (CROWBAR CLANGING) (GRUNTS) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Looks like you hit a brick wall. Go back and play the game, Chicky-Chicky. (WHISPERS) Jesus fuck. Burnham! Jesus fucking Christ. Wait up! TARA: Names and dates are crossed out... but they're letters from a soldier to his dad. It's pretty brutal-- he talks about killing the enemy, six times. Goes into graphic detail and likes it. There's nine women. The earliest one was 1971, and the most recent was 2015. Well, that's a long time. You think the same person wrote all these and killed those women? It's called "The Legacy Murders." Could be more than one. What about the cypher message? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) MARIE: It's a pretty straightforward cypher. We just need to know the key, so, we can find out how to solve it. I've done one of these before. A capital letter, a lower case, and a number. Only one, two, or three. That's the key. Twenty-six letters in the alphabet, divided by three, is 8.66. Rounded up is nine. So, nine victims. Oh, look at you, look at you. LIVIE: Jessica, Holly... Valerie-- it's the first two... letters of their first names. J-E-V-A... TARA: Now, we're rolling. Let's assume it's in the order of their deaths. Bunch of smarty-pantses. CAM: Kyle? (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) CAM: What the fuck? MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) There are consequences... (SHUTTER CLICKS) ...for not playing the game. Welcome to the Murder Castle, Cameron. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Fuck. Hey! Hey! Kyle! Fuck! Kyle! (POUNDING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (BREATHES DEEPLY) (FAINT VOICE) Kyle! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) KYLE: What's with all these secret passages? What the fuck? (THUDS) (GRUNTS) You piece of shit! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) (BURNHAM CRIES OUT) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) (PANTS) TARA: "N"-- "in." Okay, last one. Um, "SA1." TARA: "M." "HO2." TARA:: "E" "Me." "I was born with the devil in me." (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) H.H. Holmes. Babe? It's a... (GROANS IN PAIN) It's a quote... (PANTS) ...from Henry Howard Holmes. Who? "Devil in the White City." America's first serial killer. Read a fucking book. KYLE: Hey! Has anyone seen Burnham? He ran this way. LIVIE: No, he didn't. This place is full of secret doorways and passages. What? What? CAM: (SCREAMS) Kyle! TARA: Where's Cam? Cam! KYLE: I left him downstairs. No, no, no, no, no, hey! Hey. Stay with your dad. Kyle, I'll go with you! Fuck this shit! KYLE: Cam? (POUNDING) (SCREAMING) Kyle! MARIE: Honey? Cam? Cam? (POUNDING) Kyle! Cam? KYLE: Cam? Help! Oh, my God. Cam! What's happening? Somebody locked me in here! Fucking Burnham. He just fucking sucker punched me and disappeared. What do you mean disappeared? Through one of these fucking doors. I'm gonna try to find a way in, okay? (GASPS) What's going on? CAM: Mom, I'm trapped in here. (BANGING ON DOOR) I'm trapped in here! We're gonna get you out. (WAILS) How? I'm fucking trapped! MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You were warned to play the game, Cameron. (DARK MUSIC PLAYING) Oh! Fuck! Body! Body? CAM: Body! Body! Body! Holy shit! Kyle, there's a body in here! Hey! What are you talking about, Cam? Fuckin' there's a body! There's a woman's body! Holy shit, man! There's a body in here! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. (PANTS) Honey? Do you recognize her? I don't... Oh, God. (PANTS) No, no... Who is it, Cam? (CRYING) It's Aunt Virgie! Oh, no. Fuck. CAM: (CRYING) It's Aunt Virgie! (SOBS) KYLE: Why? MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Sadly, she refused to come play the game. (CAM COUGHING) (COUGHING) Oh, fuck. There's something pumping in here. It's like air conditioning or something, but it's... it's not air. (COUGHING) Oh, shit! (GAS HISSING) Oh, fuck! (COUGHING, SPLUTTERING) Oh, fuck. It's gas! There's gas in here! What kind of gas? What kind of gas? It's like... H.H. Holmes. Wait. (GASPS) What did you just say? The game. It was a clue-- (COUGHING) "I was born with the devil in me." (CAM COUGHING) Dad... (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Murder Castle... MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Now, you're getting somewhere. KYLE: You sick fuck. You gassed her. Make it stop. Now. Wait. What? Gassed who? Virginia, Alec. (WHEELCHAIR HUMS) He killed our sister. (WHEELCHAIR HUMS) Make it stop... before you kill him too! I don't know what you're talking about. KYLE: The fuck you don't! (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) What-- Kyle, w... what's going on? H.H. Holmes? The Murder Castle? You poisoned her, you psycho piece of shit! Okay, stop. He's an old man. What the fuck? (BEEPS) (WHIRRING) Cam doesn't have time for this! Wait... wait. C-- What do you mean? Cam? What happened to Cam? No, he's been with us the whole time. He didn't do anything. He built a fucking deathtrap. Open the fucking door! Now! Leave me alone! ALEC: That's enough! Get your hands off of me! LIVIE: Yeah, you're one to talk. Okay, stop! Stop it! Stop! Look, let's just take a beat and... and... and figure out what's going on. MARIE: Cam is trapped. ALEC: What do you mean, "trapped"? MARIE: In the same gas chamber that killed Virginia. Enough of this bullshit! You're not making sense! Virginia's in Santa Barbara. Open the fucking door! Let go of me. Let go of me! I'll fucking let go. (PANTS) (GRUNTS) Attaboy, you fucking-- (ROARING) Go on! (GNASHING TEETH) Stop that! KYLE: Fuck! (ELECTRICITY ZAPS) Don't do this! Come here. It's for you. You want it? Come and get it. Here! (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Dad? No! (SCREAMS) No! (ALL SCREAMING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Grandpa? ALEC: Is he... (PANTS) Yeah, he's breathing. (THIN WHEEZING BREATHS) (GAS HISSING) (CAM SPUTTERS, COUGHS) Baby? How are you doing? (WHEEZING) Cam! Talk to me. Are you okay? I need to... (COUGHING, RETCHING) I need to sit down. (COUGHING) Cam? (COUGHING) Cam, hang in there. We're going to get you out. I'm dying, Mom. (COUGHS) (WHIMPERS) (WHISPERS) Dad... I need you to open the door. We don't have a lot of time. I need you to call this off, Dad. Please. It's gone too far. Can you please just leave him alone? No. He's the only one that can tell us where the-- Do you really think he electrocuted himself to throw us off the scent? What the fuck is wrong with you? Livie, please. Cam doesn't have time for our bullshit! (WHISPERS) Actually, you're right. There is no time. Come with me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) There's gotta be a way in. There's got to be a trap door somewhere. But where? (THUMPING ON DOOR) KYLE: Let me find it. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You're getting way off track. Go back to the game. (GASPS) Liv! Told you. Secret passage. LIVIE: So... so, what do we do? MARIE: Honey, talk to me. How are you doing? I'm here. You have to stay, okay? You have to stay awake, okay? I'm trying. (CROWBAR CLANGING) MARIE: Okay. (KYLE GRUNTING) MARIE: Tell me a story. Uh... (RETCHES) H... How did you and Tara meet? You know how. No, I don't remember. I don't remember. Remind me. I don't remember. (COUGHS WEAKLY) (SOBS) We have to get this door open now! (SCREAMS) No! MARIE: What? (PANTS) It doesn't matter. He's trapped in a metal fucking box. (CROWBAR HITS GROUND) No. No. That can't be it. What? MARIE: No. It's not over! (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS, SLAMMING METAL WALL) I love you so much. Do you know that? (MARIE POUNDING, GRUNTING) I need to hear your voice! (SOBBING) Please! (SCREAMS IN RAGE) (CROWBAR CLATTERS) (TARA SOBBING) (MARIE SOBBING) (SOBBING) (GASPS) (CRYING) (SOBBING) (FIRE CRACKLING) Kyle? You know, the, um, the way you went after your dad, like you know something... what is it that you're not telling us? Are we really doing this again? It's Burnham. He attacked Kyle, he fucking killed Cam. But why? Can't just be a Holmes copycat... and how did he turn this place into a murder castle? Mr. Burnham has been working for my father for 25 years. He was in on the construction. Sorry. What's a murder castle? It was actually a boarding house. Holmes built all these trap doors, gas chambers... (SNIFFLES) ...torture rooms. One of them had an operating table and a... stove that fit humans in it. He claims to have killed 27 people, but some say it was upwards of 200. KYLE: Horseshit. I doubt he even killed 27. They paid him to give those confessions. You all sure know a lot about him. It's not a secret. It's American history. Read a fucking book. Do you know what, Livie? I'm sick of your snarky remarks. Could you stop it? MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You've mourned your loss. It's time to go back to the game. We need to know, why him and why us? What are you not telling us, Kyle? Nothing. MARIE: Bullshit. You were triggered, and you went straight for Ellison. Why? (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) What do you want me to say? Burnham or not, he built this house. Why don't you ask him? Or maybe we can ask you. You paid for the construction. You're just as much of a suspect as he is. Open your eyes, Livie. He's not who you think he is. Maybe he's not who you think he is. Maybe none of us are who we think we are. TARA: What about the game? I don't believe Burnham is the killer, and it can't be Holmes, because he died way before the nine murders. And aren't we supposed to be the suspects? Fuck the game. What's this game going to tell us that we don't already know? Burnham trapped us here, and he wants to kill us all. Well, maybe what's in here... will tell us the why. And tell us who actually did it. You want to know who actually did it? You want to know the reason why? You want to know who's to blame? Ellison J. Betts. Talk to him. (CROWBAR CLANGS) Where are you going? KYLE: I'm going to the secret fucking passage. By yourself? Oh, I don't know, Alec, do you want to hobble with me? Oh, fuck, man! Would you stop being a hero? The last time, you dragged my son with you-- Hey! Don't you fucking say that to me! It was not my fault! If we're gonna get out of here, we have to stick together, so, let me come with you. No, no, sit. (ALEC GRUNTS) Sit. I'll do it. Let's go. (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Haven't you learned your lesson? (POUNDING, THUDDING) (GRUNTS) (PANTS) Marie! A secret passage. (GASPS) Pop? Listen. My only concern right now is getting the rest of us out of here safely. Okay? I don't care about the past... or what may have happened. Look, if you could just... (SNIFFLES) This is your son asking-- (SOBS) ...begging you-- if you know anything... (GRUNTS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) Please. Pop, you're connected to this. The house... Burnham... Tell me something! Tell me it's your crazy mortal enemy exacting revenge on you-- anything! Don't just-- You're the smartest man in the room. What's the reason? You're right. I am the smartest. That's it? "Never... criticize... a man... until you've..." (GASPS) Walked a mile in his moccasins. That looks like it. But how does that get the Cryptex open? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Burnham! Come out, you motherfucker! I don't care what my dad's paying you! It's not enough! Burnham! MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You've been warned. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING WITH EFFORT) Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! (WHISPERS) What the fuck is down there? KYLE: Whoa! (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Oh! Kyle! Kyle! (BOTTLES RATTLING) (CART CLATTERING) Where's the fucking light? (MUSIC RISES) (FLICKS SWITCH) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) JOY: (SOBS, GASPS) Kyle? (MONITOR BEEPS) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) This is what happens when you don't play by the rules. Joy tried to leave without playing. (JOY SOBS QUIETLY) (SOBBING) KYLE: Joy? (GASPING, GROANS WEAKLY) (GASPING) I'm so sorry. (SOBBING) "Never criticize a man until you've walked a mile in his moccasins." I don't get it. Well, hold on a second. How many numbers are on the lock? LIVIE: There's no numbers. It's just a seven-letter word. (GASPING IN PAIN) (SOBBING) (MOANS, SOBS) (INHALES SHARPLY, EXHALES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (KYLE SOBBING) (JOY WEEPING) (KYLE ROARS) MARIE: It's Kyle! It's Kyle. He's-- He's somewhere underground. He's... (KYLE RAGING IN DISTANCE) (PANTS) (SOBBING) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) This room is rigged with an industrial oven that turned on the moment you fell through the chute. You have about three minutes before the heat starts to cook you alive. Burnham! I'll fucking kill you! MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You refused to play the game upstairs. I'm giving you one final chance. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (ROAR OF HEAT INCREASING) KYLE: (ECHOES) Burnham! Why are you doing this? Wait. Uh, move. Alec? Oh, my God. He's down there. Kyle? (BANGING) Kyle! (PANTING) Kyle, talk to us, what's going on? MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) It won't open, and you can't break it down. There is only one way out. Did my dad put you up to this? If it's me he wants, let him take his revenge! But not her! Let her go! Please! JOY: (CROAKING FAINTLY) Kyle... Kyle... (KYLE PANTS) I love you. I'm gonna get us out of this. (EXHALES SHARPLY) I swear, I'll get us out of this. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Search deep in your heart for the key to escaping. Search in my heart...? JOY: Search. Search... search deep in my heart. No. I can't. You can. KYLE: (ROARS) God! (SOBS) You can. I'm going to get you something for the pain, okay? (SNIFFLES) Okay. We have to do something. They're gonna get cooked alive. ALEC: (GRUNTS) What do we do? We can't let him die. LIVIE: Dad, he's got to find the key. (ROAR OF HEAT INCREASING) (IMPLEMENTS CLATTERING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Babe! Babe, I got something! (PANTS) Sorry, babe. (HEAT SIZZLES) (SCREAMS) Fuck! (GRUNTS, PANTS) (COUGHING) I got it. (GASPING) (COUGHING) (COUGHS) KYLE: I'm sorry, babe! (STITCHES SNIPPING) KYLE: Oh, God! (BEEPING INCREASING) KYLE: Joy, breathe.

(GASPING) (HEART MONITOR ALARM WAILING) (SHOUTS IN DISTRESS) Oh, God! (GASPING, WHIMPERING) KYLE: Come on... I got it! Babe! Did he say he got it? God! (RATTLING) KYLE: A dog whistle? Hey, Kyle? Kyle, open the door. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Joy! I got it! (HEART MONITOR FLATLINING) KYLE: Joy? (MUSIC RISES) (SCREAMS) (GASPS) (KYLE SCREAMING) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (SIZZLING) (BEEPING) Kyle? Do you have the key? Come on, brother. Talk to me, man. (SOBS) Please get yourself out of there! (PANTING) She's gone. And I'm so sorry... but you have a chance. (FIRE CRACKLING) You don't have to die with her. (SOBS, GROANS) She's all I have. No. No. (SNIFFLES) You got me. I'm... I got your back. I'm with you. I'm here for you. I appreciate the lie, brother. It's not a lie. It's the truth, I promise. Look, Kyle, there's... there's a lot from our childhood that I blocked out, and I used to think it was because Mom left us, but one thing I do remember is that I was a total asshole... (GRUNTS) ...to you when we were kids. Okay, you're right, I tried to keep Dad away from you and you away from Dad as much as I could, and at first, I thought it was jealousy, but then he started taking me to-- Alec. I know about Dad. What do you mean? God! I tried to stop him. (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) I failed. (ROARING, BREATHES DEEPLY) (SIZZLING) (BUBBLING, BOILING) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) You have the key. All you need now is to make some music. (BLOWS WHISTLE) (RATTLING) (SOBS) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Well done. (ALL COUGHING) Kyle! MARIE: What happened? Mr. Betts! MARIE: What were you talking about? (GRUNTS) Uh... You want us to walk a mile in your shoes? Fine. We'll walk in-- Wait. A mile is 5,280 feet. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Dad, there is no numbers. It can't be five-two-eight-o. No... no, it is a mile. In Roman numerals. Five thousand... "V." Two hundred-- "C-C..." Eighty... "L-X-X... X." (MECHANISM CLICKS) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Congratulations. You've found the complete confession of H.H. Holmes. You're in the home stretch. Almost there. ALEC: This is my father's handwriting. This is your handwriting, Father! Oh, Jesus God. (CANE THUMPS ON FLOOR) "Murder one..." "North Vietnamese regular." "He surprised me and had me dead to rights, but missed with his bayonet." (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) "I grabbed the rifle, wrestled it from him, and before I knew it, stabbed him in the heart." "He bled all over me." "It was warm and satisfying." (THUMBING THROUGH PAGES) "Murder seven-- Magdalena Lujo." (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ALEC: "Dear Maggie-- she was harder than the others." "My beloved wife." "She truly loved me, but had no idea whom she married." "Magdalena"? That-- That's not your mother. No, it isn't. He was married before? At the same time. You're a fucking monster. This? (YELLS) This is your legacy? Not your family. Murder. You have confessions matching each of Holmes'. TARA: So, he's a copycat? ALEC: "Murder 14... Anna Betts." (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (BOOK THUMPS SHUT) (CLATTERS) ALEC: (GASPS) Is that what this is about? We're supposed to be the relatives of Holmes' 14th victim? Are you fucking joking? She was my grandmother. Holmes made her his 14th victim two years after she bore his son... my father... William. No. ELLISON: Yes. We're the progeny of America's original serial killer. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) It's our family legacy. So... so that's... that's what this is about? William grew up... in the Chicago streets... blocks from where his mother was murdered. He was a transient... traveling, working odd jobs, doing petty crimes, until he met my mother, Katherine. He convinced her to buy the Murder Castle property-- thought it was a good investment. She had no idea its significance to him, or that he was born with the same darkness in his soul. When... I was 11... I watched William murder my mother... and kill himself, continuing the cycle. The c... the c... cycle? (GASPS IN HORROR) What? Um... What? What is it? (VOICE SHAKING) Fourteen... It's Number 14, his notes. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Sara... (GLEEFULLY) Yes... ALEC: Mom? (SCREAMS) No-- You killed her? (SOBS) And all those women... when I was a kid? You had me there with you, following them... Every one of them... and you helped me do it. ALEC: No! No, I did not. ELLISON: You made it so easy for me to spy on them, follow them, learn everything I needed to know before I strangled them. No one looks twice at a dad and his son. Sometimes you were waiting in the car. Hey. (GRUNTS) ELLISON: Hey! (MUSIC RISES) (ALL SCREAMING) God! (ALL GASPING) (ROARING) You want to be Henry Howard Holmes so bad? You can die like him. (SCREAMING) Dad! (CHOKING) (GASPS) (ALEC GRUNTS) (LIVIE SCREAMING) (GRUNTING WITH EFFORT) (CHOKING) LIVIE: Let him go, please!

MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) The cycle continues. When you snapped his neck, I can only imagine your daddy was smiling inside. knowing that he was your first victim. Fuck you! We're the victims! Why us? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) "Legacy." Grandpa was a third-generation murderer. He wanted one of his own to continue the cycle. Or die? MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) It's all there in the book. Oh, shit. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Ellison's confessions. Virgie's already in here. Number 21. We were never suspects in his sick game, we were his final fucking victims to finish his legacy. Virgie, Joy, Cam, Kyle, the four of us, that makes 27. MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) Almost. Your math is off. He only needs three to complete the series... and that's how this ends. So, that's it? One of us gets to live? MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.) That is the game. The real game. And this suitcase shit? ALEC: That was bullshit. It was just a sick joke to waste time as he whittled down the odds. We're not letting him hunt us down like dogs. We're getting the hell out of here now. Honey, we need to go. Screw this game. Screw your dad. We're leaving. TARA: The dogs. What about the dogs? They'll tear us apart. Kyle had the whistle. (OMINOUS DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Okay. Can someone make sure it doesn't close on me? I'll watch it. (SOBS, RETCHING) (GASPS) Did you get it? Almost. (COUGHING, GAGGING) Fuck the dogs. Yeah, fuck 'em.

Come here, come here. Okay, Alec's not gonna make it, so, maybe we make a stand? With what, a broken kayak? We don't stand a chance. He's armed! What other choice do we have? Y... you guys should just go. MARIE: No, I'm not gonna do that. No, there has to be another beach nearby. I remember seeing a path leading out of here. I'll go check it out. I'll see if there's a boat or other people, anything-- Yeah, or maybe you'll keep on running and leave us all here to get fucking killed! Okay, Livie-- God, I'm sorry. I'm just really stressed. It's okay. I'll come back. I promise. Okay. Good luck! Good luck. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) (GASPS) (BARKING GROWING CLOSER) (DOGS BARKING) MALE VOICE: (FILTERED ON P.A.)

But what about you? No! This is all my fault. (SOBS) No. Yes, I... I could've done something about him years ago, before it came to this, but I... I... I wasn't s... strong enough. MARIE: Bullshit!

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) MARIE: You had it the whole time? (HORRIFIED SOB) Oh... Oh, my God. (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) You were in on this from the... the beginning. What? (BLADES RING) (MUSIC RISES) (SCREAMING) No! (GASPING, SCREAMING) Oh, God, no! (MARIE SCREAMING) (SOBBING, GASPING) Sorry, Dad. You know, Grandpa never thought you had it in you to be a killer. Guess you proved him wrong. (GASPS) (SNIFFLES) You're just like Ellison. Thank you. You know... Grandpa always thought maybe Kyle had the darkness... but when he caught him red-handed, he didn't hand him over to the police, because, practically speaking, he was worried about how it would look to the shareholders to find out the founder of their company was a... serial killer. Instead, he broke Grandpa's back and called it an accident, which he must've thought solved the problem. Except, well, it didn't. I don't understand. No shit, Mom. (THUMPS) (GASPS) Anyway... Grandpa would've preferred Kyle had killed him. Then he would've died with the hope that one of his sons might carry on the family legacy. Never in a million years did he think it would have been you, Dad. You knew about this. All of it? I made him a promise... to carry on the legacy. By playing this awful game? Awful, maybe, but it was fair. Grandpa made sure everyone had a chance, including you. (KNIFE SWISHING) Fuck you! You got the knife. (CHUCKLES) Nice. You might just be one of us yet.
