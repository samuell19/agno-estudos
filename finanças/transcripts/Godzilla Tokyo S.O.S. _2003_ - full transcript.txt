Circuit connection, 40 percent. Fifty-five percent, 70 percent. Eighty percent, 95 percent. DNA computer connection initializing. DNA computer connections complete. System normal. - Intercepted unidentified target. - Cruise missile? Orange alert. Unidentified target. Stand by to intercept target. A UFO is heading for Japan. The target is approaching. Entering the southern air-defense zone... ...and is heading north off Iwo Jima. Intercept. Two F-15s dispatched from Hyakuri Air Base. - Any visuals? - Yes, sir, coming up. Blue One, what's your status? Blue One, radar locked on target, we're going in to identify. Target has reduced speed to Mach 2. - Commencing pursuit. - Roger, Blue One. Target approaching. Entering air space. You are violating Japanese air domain. Take reverse course immediately. It's ignoring all our warnings. Roger, Blue One, copy. Target in sight, cannot identify. Request to fire a warning shot. Confirm fire of warning shot. Safety system off. Target locked on. Target still on course. - What's that? - What's the problem, Blue One? - Singing, I hear singing. - Singing? It's just your imagination, Blue One. - Blue Two, come in. - He's coming right at us. It's not responding! I can't pull up! Shoot it down. Fire all missiles. - Roger. - Fire at will. Safety systems off. What's happening? Target has disappeared. We've lost the radar signal, sir. - Was it shot down? - No missile reached the target. We're getting a visual from the satellite. My God. As we reported in our news bulletin today... ... Godzilla has not been sighted since last May, when it attacked Tokyo. Mechagodzilla is still under repair and is not operational. A defense force spokesman says that it will not run wild this time... ... as it did before. This is Koji Nakamoto at Yokosuka Naval Base. This F1 is the first supersonic fighter... ...made entirely in Japan. Now it's a little outdated, unfortunately. Look at it. What a fuselage. The clean lines from the nose down to the tail. Uncle Yoshi, have you ever touched a real one? Shun, didn't I tell you not to call me uncle? Yeah, my first job was as ground crew for the F1. Then F-4s and F-15s. There'll probably never be another one like this. - Hey, and Mecha G? - Mecha G? That's a good machine too. Great. Finished. That's great. I'll show it to Grandpa. Grandpa, look, it's finished. An earthquake. Mr. Chujo? Mr. Chujo? Mr. Chujo? Here we are, Mr. Chujo. Incredible. Tell me, am I dreaming? No, you're not dreaming. It's been a long time, hasn't it? Uncle, are you okay? But, uncle, who are those girls? Don't worry now. They're old acquaintances. So you do remember us, sir? Well, naturally. How could I forget you? Do you remember, you met two fairies from our family on Infant Island... ...43 years ago. Well, now we've come to find you. Yes, but I'm an old man now. This here is my grandson. Please, sir, we have a favor to ask of you. - A favor? - That's right. We came here because we believe... ...you'll be able to understand our problem. Well, all right, if you think I can help. What's the favor? It's Godzilla's bones. You must send them back to sea. Human beings made a weapon using the bones from Godzilla. That was a mistake. It was a mistake to build Mechagodzilla? My nephew, Yoshi. He's in the air force... ...on the Mecha G ground crew. No human being may touch the souls of the dead. We came to tell you that Godzilla's bones must return to the sea... ...and remain there. Forever? But Mechagodzilla is our only protection. That's right. What if Godzilla attacks us again one day? If that happens, then Mothra will be there to protect you. But 43 years ago, Mothra destroyed Tokyo. Why would it choose to protect us this time? Please listen. Godzilla's bones must be returned to the sea. If they're not, then Mothra will declare war on the human race. Naturally, we don't want that war to happen. And neither does Mothra. During the fight with Godzilla... ...Mechagodzilla suffered damage to 37 percent of its components. It lost an arm and its Absolute Zero system. However, repairs are continuing at pace. I'm pleased to tell you that the arm has been replaced today. Minister. Suppose Godzilla returns. Is Mechagodzilla ready to go into action? The Absolute Zero system. Is it repaired yet? As of now, it's hard to tell... ...when repairs to the Absolute Zero system will be complete. However, Mechagodzilla is working. It doesn't make any sense at all. They know it's not operational. We haven't checked its mobility. Isn't that right? You listening, Chujo? Sure. Yeah, that's right. During the battles last year... ...we inflicted serious damage on Godzilla... ...as you well know. We've continued searching for Godzilla using the surveyor satellite. But we haven't been able to find it. - I have a question. - Please go ahead. Experts reported that the monster was attracted by the bones... ...that were used to construct Mechagodzilla. I'd like to know the defense agency's opinion. Can you comment on that? Chujo, how did your vacation go? Okay. I just stayed at my uncle's place. Did something happen on vacation? - No, why? - You've been so absent-minded lately. Disassembling strobe three... - Where's the mess? - On the first floor. The new Mecha G pilots. Yo. - Bye, guys. - Okay, see you later. I'm home. In his speech to the press, the minister said Godzilla wouldn't appear. So, what's your opinion on that? Well, if that's correct, why are we wasting so much money... ...on repairing Mechagodzilla? Now, we've seen what Godzilla can do and we can't take any chances. This is our only defense. In Shinagawa, the theater of last year's great encounter with Godzilla... ... most of the area was destroyed, and rebuilding has yet to begin. Yes, but if I'm right, Mechagodzilla was designed to fight Godzilla... ... and other monsters that attacked. That means Godzilla isn't necessarily the only danger... ... to this country, and that other threats to national security... You're back early, Shun. If that's the case, it seems strange... Say, what are you doing? Just putting a few things in order. See? I'm making a record for future generations. You see these? They're photos of Infant Island. Forty-three years ago, I went there as a language expert. I was part of an expedition. It was there that I met the fairies. Is this what Mothra did to Tokyo, Grandpa? That's right. Mothra attacked Tokyo... ...because some villains kidnapped the fairies... ...and brought them back here to Japan. Mothra was merely coming to rescue the two fairies. See this? It's the Mothra symbol. We found this on the island. What happened was that we rescued the fairies... ...from their kidnappers. Then this symbol was painted onto an airport runway. That way, we successfully managed to attract Mothra to us. Yashiro, Sekine, Kuriyama. These three pilots will be leaving us temporarily to go overseas. They've been chosen to study combat tactics and strategy in the States. We hope the experience will lead to better efficiency and precision... ...in Mechagodzilla's operations. They will return to Japan in a year... ...bringing with them newly acquired experience. We wish them all well. When do you think you'll be leaving? Our flight leaves tomorrow night. Thank you very much. Hey, come on, you can relax a little. Here. Have a drink. - How's it going? - Fine. I've just been accepted as a pilot. It was confirmed today. - That's great. - Say "congratulations." We did work together, you know. Hey, introduce me. This is Asuza. We worked together a few years ago. - We were ground crew together. - How are you? So tell me, why did you wanna be a pilot? Flying has been a dream for me, so I volunteered as soon as I could. What are you doing hiding over here? This is Akiba, my colleague. A top gun. Mecha G's first pilot. Sure, he may be a good pilot, I grant you. But the way he treats machines, it's a wonder there's anything left. What's your game? Human beings made a weapon using the bones from Godzilla. That was a mistake. Well, are you a product of man's mistake? Airman Chujo, Mecha G ground crew. Why aren't you at the party? Well, I didn't feel comfortable. I'd rather be here. See, parties like that aren't really my cup of tea. Mine either. Did you come here to say goodbye to Mechagodzilla? It's all right, you can stand easy. Thank you. Well? It's true. I'm going to miss Mechagodzilla. We never finished the job against Godzilla. I get the feeling that it doesn't want to fight Godzilla anymore. Maybe it's better if it stays that way, in disrepair. No, I can't agree. I wanna fix it so it can fight another day. Please take care of it. You want me to freeze the project? Yes, prime minister, that's what I'm asking you. Let's call it a recommendation. To be honest with you, your story is ridiculous. Why is it so ridiculous? Tell me, what does this say? It says that life has to be lived within the time that nature allows. We have made a killing machine with the bones from Godzilla. We mustn't forget that. Somewhere, we crossed the line between mortals and gods. So, what you're saying is we should stop the project? You must remember, man made nuclear weapons... ...which brought Godzilla back, and that was a mistake. You're right, it was a mistake. But Mothra destroyed our capital city. I just can't risk it doing so again. I agree with you that one day we'll have to discard Mecha G. However, as long as this country is threatened by Godzilla... ...we can't give up our only defense. It would be suicidal for us. It's my duty to protect every citizen of this nation. Even if that defense brings disaster to those you're trying to protect? This morning, the carcass of the creature... ... was found washed up on the Pacific coast. Units from the Japanese self-defense forces are working flat out... ...to try and get rid of the carcass. - You'll have to clear the area. - But I have to finish... - Security comes first. We have orders. All civilians must evacuate the area. Take a good look. This is what we're up against. Worse, some of the monsters are even bigger than this. It was wounded, it seems, and managed to reach the coast. And it's a big one too. First one of these we've had for 17 years. - A Kamoebas, right? - No, a specialist? It was first found on Selgio Island. Discovered by Dr. Miya some years ago. Megalo Matamata, giant sea turtle. Couldn't he come up with an easier name to pronounce? The injury? Right here. It has deep cuts in its neck caused by giant claws. It was fatally wounded. It was attacked by some kind of giant predator, I'd say. Like another monster, sir? Yes. It can only be... ...Godzilla. Captain, we've got an unidentified object off our port bow. All ahead one-third. Sonar, confirm acoustics print. - All ahead one-third. - Aye, aye, sir. The target is approaching rapidly. Distance, 280. Full right rudder. All ahead full. Full right rudder. All ahead full. Oh, Jesus. Big heartbeats. - Well, what about the Absolute Zero? - I already told you, didn't I? Get me a synthetic diamond 1.25 meters in diameter. - And I'll fix it tomorrow. - There's a budget limit, you know. How do you expect me to purchase a diamond that size? If you can't afford it, give up. Isn't there any alternative to the diamond? Only carbon in that crystal form gives enough power. Nothing else can replace it. A U.S. Nuclear submarine was lost off Guam earlier today. Godzilla? The Navy and Air Force are searching. So far, they've found no trace. That's why we need Mechagodzilla back in service quickly. It can move without Absolute Zero. But it won't be functional. I was told it could work without it, is that right? Yes, it can move, that's true. Wait a minute. We haven't even done the final checkup yet. - It would be suicide. - Chujo. It's quite true, sir. The final checkup's not complete. Mecha G can move, but if it does get damaged... ...we're not sure if it'll be able to survive. In other words, Mechagodzilla could be lost forever. So how long is it going to take for this final checkup? I need to know. - At the earliest, two weeks. - I don't have the time. And what happens if Godzilla attacks in the next two weeks? Lieutenant Yamamoto, report to green sector. You don't want Mechagodzilla to fight? Somebody told me your uncle went to see the prime minister... ...to try and stop the Mecha G project. If we dump Mecha G, do you think Mothra will defend the country? What is it? Maybe you're just scared of fighting Godzilla. - Come on, don't be an idiot. - Look, Akiba... ...I’ve worked here for over four years, you hear me? No one knows Mecha G better than me. You're just a mechanic. Don't mix it up with a professional fighter. Shoulder arms! Right turn! Left, right, left, right. You are an idiot. I know you've made Mechagodzilla your life, but still. It's all you talk about. Engine performance stats. The latest developments in navigational aids. You even get crazy about cannons. Machines are the only things you're interested in. Who says I get crazy about cannons? You're in love with machines. You don't even think about women. Chujo, you have trouble with Akiba? - Yes, I'm sorry, sir. - I couldn't care less. But you must have upset the big brass. You've been summoned to a hearing. Defense Agency I hear my son behaved disgracefully towards you. I must apologize. You know, my son volunteered to be a pilot because his ambition... ...was to pilot the only giant robot ever constructed. And he has realized that ambition. However, that is not the point here. I asked you here today not to talk about my son's ambitions... ...but about Mothra. We'd like you to tell us what happened that day up at your uncle's place. Quite honestly, we have a little problem here. We find it very hard to believe the story Mr. Chujo told us. Tell me something. Did you really see Mothra that evening? Is it also true that Mothra told you it would fight in place of Mechagodzilla? Tell me, are you dropping the project? If Mothra does manage to kill Godzilla... ...we won't need Mechagodzilla anymore. This isn't a formal hearing, Airman Chujo. So you can speak freely. What happened that evening? Was it reality or just a vision? Will Dr. Yamamoto please contact reception. Will Dr. Yamamoto please contact reception. - Uncle. - Hi. Well, then. What else? What did you reply? So you'd rather not tell me, I see. All I can see is, we made Mechagodzilla into a weapon. And now maybe we'll scrap it. So either way, it's a selfish decision. Whatever. It's up to you now. You do what you think is best. This is Red 29. Point 3251 north, 1390 east. A giant creature has been located off the coast. Present heading is northwest. Surfacing! All ships, battle stations. - Weapons systems ready to fire. - Systems ready. CIC control. Radar localize. Fire at will. It's still closing. Range, 450. - Prepare secondary systems. - Yes, sir. Secondary systems, stand by. Target locked on. Fire. - Right rudder. - Right rudder. It's submerging again, sir. - Prepare torpedoes. - Prepare torpedoes. - Launcher ready. - Fire. We've been told that earlier... ... Godzilla was seen off Hachijo Island... ... and is presently heading towards Tokyo despite heavy bombing. Say, Grandpa, tell me, if Godzilla does attack... ...and if Mechagodzilla goes out to stop it... ...do you think that Mothra will come to protect us all? - Along the Tokyo shore, according to the emergency director. We've loaded the Hyper Maser. We can use that instead of Absolute Zero. Mecha G is functional. Hyper Maser unit loaded. Godzilla heading northwest. Shinagawa's been a pile of rubble since last year. We'll fight it there. - You mean, fight it on land, sir? - We have to try to minimize damage. Godzilla still advancing, course and speed steady. Godzilla just passed Uraga. Set defense lines, Shinagawa City. We have to lure it there. All units, redeploy immediately! Hurry! Spotter One, land troops redeployed in Shinagawa City. Keep coming! Father, Shun has disappeared. Residents are required to leave immediately... ... taking only essential items. He can't have. - Go to the refuge, quickly. - But, Father... Target moving into the harbor. Could be surfacing. Over. Lookout One, confirm explosion of mines. Target moving into the harbor. Godzilla! Prepare to fire! - Godzilla has touched land. - All units, pull back to point B. Confirm chest injury. You see that? Judging by the wound, it's the same Godzilla. So that could mean, if it hasn't healed completely... ...we may still have a chance. Redeployment. All infantry units, point B. SSM One in place, confirmed. Pulling back to point B. Over. Roger, SSM One. Over. Target locked on. Tubes ready. Fire. Control, I can't read you, you're breaking up. Launch confirmed. Missiles tracking target. Come on! Hurry up! Quickly! Follow the markers! Hey, where are you going?! Come back here! All armored units in position! Target approaching! Target approaching! - Prepare to fire Hyper Maser. - Sir, firing Maser. Fire. - It's passed Shinagawa. - It didn't stop. Sir, it's heading for Hachioji. Godzilla is advancing towards Minato District. Mechagodzilla. It's luring Godzilla there. - Godzilla in Minato District. - Check the unit connections. Unit connections complete, A-okay. All right, finally, Mechagodzilla is ready. - Hey! You're running the wrong way! - It's okay. Shun! Come back here! We have to evacuate! Wait, Grandpa. I wanna try something first. Godzilla's still advancing! Our defenses are unable to stop it! That's it. The symbol. Hey... Hey, what's that? There's an old man, and there's a young kid with him. What the hell are they doing down there? And what's that sign? Mothra. Mothra! Grandpa, Mothra's come to save us. - Mothra. - It can't be. Godzilla and Mothra. If those two attack us together, we're not gonna make it. All units, maximum alert. Mothra has appeared. - It's attacking Godzilla. - Godzilla? The prime minister has ordered us to be on standby. So for now, continue the checking and any maintenance. - Sir! - Dismissed. Chujo, come here. Mechagodzilla, remain on standby. I repeat, Mechagodzilla, remain on standby. That's my uncle and my nephew. I thought so. Your uncle drew the same symbol... ...on the airport runway 43 years ago. It's the symbol to attract Mothra. Tell me, sir, are they safe? We haven't been able to pick them up yet. Whenever the symbol's drawn anywhere... ...Mothra will appear immediately. Did the two fairies tell you that, Chujo? No, they didn't, sir. So why are there only two fairies left? I've no idea. Excuse me. Well, they don't want us to use Mechagodzilla. No doubt they're hoping Mothra will do the fighting for us. His son's the pilot. Why doesn't he give the order? Why do you think? He's afraid of losing his son in the battle. Look at that. Mothra must know it's going to die. - Why's that? - Well, it's attacking with its scales. Mothra's weapon of last resort. Once it loses its scales, it won't be able to stay airborne for long. Shun, let's go. Pull back! Everybody move! Let's get out of here! - Right, sir! - Come on, let's go! Godzilla's position unchanged. Mothra's wings have been injured. Mothra is continuing its attack. That's enough. Whatever this battle costs in lives and equipment... ...we have to do something quick to save Mothra. We can't stay idle. If we do... ...then we've lost anyway. You mean... We must launch Mechagodzilla. Prepare yourselves for the final battle, gentlemen. Prepare to launch Mechagodzilla. Mecha G control, ready to program vectoring. Mechagodzilla ready for launch. Locking arms away. All systems running. White Herons One and Two, you are scrambled. Akiba. Listen. The final check couldn't be completed. If you're fighting at close quarters, try to bear that in mind. Don't worry, Chujo. With my skill, I can overcome any maintenance problems. Just take care of him, will you? He's tough, but a little bit reckless. Be seeing you. Final launch preparation. Clear launch pad. - Inspection complete. - A TP system clear. All systems operational. Mechagodzilla lifting into launch position. Fuel levels, maximum charge. Crew in position. Weapons systems activated. Preflight check complete. Ready for liftoff. Pad lights, activate. Pad lights on. Releasing restraints. Harness in place. Mechagodzilla ready. - Ready for transportation. - Ready to lift. Mecha G lift. Where's my uncle and Shun? We haven't had any news yet, I'm afraid. Mechagodzilla has been launched, Chujo. You're off duty. - Thank you, sir. - Wait. You need a car. Take mine. Tokyo Tower is hit! It's falling! The target's in sight. Here we go. Release tow harness. Mecha G. It's moving. - Fire one! - Roger. Try this on for size. Come on, move! It looks like Mothra's hit. Mothra. - Look! - There's two! They're twins! Where are they? It's gotta be this way. Bonin Islands, sir. Two large targets identified. - Heading for Tokyo. - Heading confirmed. - Targets on visual. - Speed, 30 knots. Mothra larvae? So that flying object was Mothra. It was trying to help us. It must have laid eggs on the island so that its descendants... ...could carry on the battle. - Akiba! - Okay. Arm unit, jettison. Rear launchers. Fire one. Hey, Uncle! Shun. Come on, talk to me, Shun! Hello, Uncle. I told you not to call me uncle. Wanna play dirty, do you? Too slow, boy. - Mecha G is down. - Control room... ...giant worms are surfacing. - Mecha G isn't moving. - Mothra larvae landed. Come in, Akiba. Damn. We've lost the controls. They really are Mothra larvae. Mothra. Can't we switch over to manual temporarily? No, not unless the damage is fixed. We don't even have the minimum. It's not enough. We're powerless, sir. Then find a solution! I can try to fix it, sir. - Who's that? - Chujo? I'm at Hibiya Park right now. - I'm pretty sure I can fix it. - But you're not a qualified pilot. I'm a qualified mechanic, right? That's what you need right now. He's dead right, sir. A pilot can't fix this. Please, let's give him a chance. Well, sir? Control center to all units. A mechanic is attempting... ... to repair Mechagodzilla. Stand by for logistical support. - Try to lure Godzilla away. - Chujo? We'll escort you to Mechagodzilla. I'm grateful to you, sir. All right, don gas masks. Good luck, Uncle! I'll repair it. Don't worry. Hey, everyone, listen! Chujo's gonna fix Mecha G! - All right! - Right on! Central control, we copy. We're escorting Airman Chujo... ... to Mechagodzilla to repair it... White Heron Four, lure Godzilla away from the area. Roger. - We can't go any further. - All right. Where's Mechagodzilla? Somewhere near Akasaka. We'll take a detour. - Let's move out. - Yes, sir. The subway is blocked. - Well, find another route. - Roger. What the...? Where's my case? All right, we'll talk about Godzilla later. Now I've got work to do. No time to stand around talking. I have to repair Mecha G. If I don't, our last hope of defending Japan will have been lost. This way? This is Chujo. I've managed to locate Mechagodzilla. I'm going inside. Roger. Keep Godzilla away from this area. Roger. Maser, fire. Control, patch me through to the maintenance unit. Roger. This is Tadokoro. Chujo, you there? The armor on the right side of the head is damaged. The communication cables... ...and the primary control circuits are burnt out. Roger, Chujo. Copy that. - I need circuit diagrams, quickly! - Yes, sir. The control cable's gone. No wonder it shut down. We need a bypass, quick. The cable's unrepairable. Over. We've got to find a way. - What about J3? - I've got an idea. - Guys, why don't we try J3. - J3, right. Right. Tell Chujo to patch it into the main router. - Chujo. - I heard you. I'm on my way. Right. It's connected. Now, in the maintenance pod. Roger. On my way there. Control, this is Chujo. - Do you read me? - I read you. Go ahead. MP2 is damaged. I can't open it. I'm trying MP3. Roger. Yeah, MP3 looks okay. Radioactivity cleaning on. Chujo, are you all right? Chujo? Yeah, I'm fine. I think it's fixed now. You can try the controls again. Okay, we'll take it from here. Now, get out of there. Right. Resuming command of Mechagodzilla. What's wrong, Chujo? What's going on? Answer me! Chujo? I'm okay. I'm out of Mecha G. Resume control. Akiba, Godzilla is heading for the city center. Resume control now. Roger. Resuming control. The capitol. It's destroyed! Preparing Hyper Maser. Stand by. Fire! No! Mecha G. I didn't understand you. Looks like Mechagodzilla doesn't want to fight. Maybe I've been wrong all along. You just wanted... ...to sleep peacefully. Godzilla's bones must be returned to the sea. Mecha G... ...I’m sorry. And now, Godzilla must return to the sea. Remember, no human being may touch the souls of the dead. Did I hear the voice of the fairies? Human beings should recognize their mistakes and correct them. It's the only way they can redeem themselves. Togashi... ...finish Godzilla. This job will be the final mission. When this mission is over... ...we scrap the project. Akiba. Fire triple Hyper Maser shot, immediately. Roger. What's going on? - What are you doing? Stop it now. - I'm not doing anything. Mecha G's not responding. It's gone crazy again. It's moving. But where? I don't believe it. It's taking Godzilla out to sea. You'll have to shoot it down. No, wait! It's Chujo. They're going to the Japan Trench. I get it now. I think Mecha G wants to sink itself with Godzilla. Chujo. Are you in there? Please answer me, Chujo. Are you inside there, Chujo? Yes. The hatch won't open. There's no way I can get out of here. Chujo, are you piloting it? No, sir. Mecha G is piloting itself. I can't control it from here. Why didn't you tell me before? I'm ready to die. Too bad. I'll go down with Mechagodzilla. I'm not going to let you die like this. I'm coming for you. Go on, jump! I'll pick you up! Come on, Chujo. Hurry up! Let go of it! Chujo! Goodbye... ...Mecha G. Mecha G! Depth 3700, 3800. Contact fading. 3850 meters. Lost. No more signal, sir. Contact has been lost. I don't know if we can really call it a victory. Maybe a hollow victory. But one thing's sure. We made many mistakes in the past. It's up to us to correct those mistakes. Perhaps we've learned one thing: Humility. White Herons returning to base. Mecha G, missing in action. All mobilized units, stand down to yellow alert. Units three and five, report immediately to Shinagawa... ... for reconstruction missions. Remember one thing: Life has to be lived within the time that nature allows. Mecha G, it saved my life. Bullshit. I'm the one who saved your ass. - I guess you did. - And, of course... ...my copilot. You showed great courage, and we're very grateful to you. The souls of the dead can now rest in peace... ...in the cradle of eternity. Thank you. You're welcome. Today's bioformation experiment shall commence momentarily. Bioformation of extinct subject commencing. I repeat: Bioformation experiment... ... shall commence momentarily. This concludes announcements.
