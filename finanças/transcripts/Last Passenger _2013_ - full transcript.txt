Welcome aboard the 10:30 from Charing Cross to Tunbridge Wells. Stopping London Bridge, Orpington, Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, High Brooms and Tunbridge Wells. I'll be moving around the train shortly. Please have your tickets ready for inspection. Where are we, Max? Are we still in London? I think so. Can we have one game? Just one. - One game of what? - Rock, paper, scissors. And then you have to promise to get some sleep, OK? - Best of five. - No. I'm not doing best of five. One game. OK. Let me warm up my hands. Hands are very important to "rock, paper, scissors". Ready and preying for action. Rock, paper, scissors! - Best of three. - Rock, paper, scissors. - Hang on a minute, you're cheating. - No I'm not. Yes you are. You're guessing what I'm thinking, aren't you? - You're reading my mind. - But that's not cheating. Alright, best of five. Ready? - Somebody's... - No, they're not. - Somebody is ringing you. This is Shaler. Sorry? Hang on a second. You lot mind keeping it down? I'm on the phone! Thank you very much. Hang on a sec. Mouse, you just wait here. I'm going over there. Bit quieter. Harry can forage a bit, OK? Tell me you've got police restraining drunks, teenagers in tears and nurses doubling as bouncers. I'm on the train home from London. It's self-ventilating. Well no, I took my boy to see "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". Where's the registrar? I'm with my dad. He's over there. Yeah, no, sorry, you cut out for a sec. - What is his name? - Harry. No, no, no. Don't do that. I'll be there. Just clear the recess. Call the trauma team. Don't wait for the blood results. Don't wait for the blood results. Just get them to Escada. I will be there in 47 minutes. - You said Harry could forage for food. - Here's a tissue. Oh, God. You're lucky I don't take Harry away right now. - I'm so, so sorry. - I'm alright. This is how my night's been going. - I take it this little charmer's yours? - Charmer, half right. - Did you say you're sorry, Max? - Sorry. Honestly. It's fine. It won't set. Listen, can I pay for the cleaning? Buy me a new coat, if it makes you feel better. I'm joking, really. I'm fine. Thanks. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, I'll survive. You, sit down, don't move. Max, that was the hospital. There's been a car crash, monkey, and they need me in tonight. And I'm taking you to stay at gran and grandpa's, OK? They'll have mince pies, eh? Ice cream, chocolate cake. And they'll have lots and lots of whiskey. I'm sorry, monkey. - How long now? - Hmm? Before you said you'd be at the hospital in about 47 minutes. - Well, it was just... - How can you get away with being so vague? I mean what about the seconds? Are all doctors so meticulous or is it just you? Dad's a really good doctor. - He can tell what's wrong with people just by looking at them. - Can he, now? - What about her? - Her? Pneumocranial disorder. "Pneumo" as in air, "cranial" as in skull. - "Airhead". Nice save! - Yeah, the price is the same. Would you like to see some of my pictures? - Yes, I'd love to see your pictures! - No you really don't. Max. - Thank you. Yes, I would. I love art! - I warned you. - Wow. This is one of my stories I've been doing, and the pictures are falling out and everything. I don't really know why. - You'll be there all night. - And this is "Treasure Island". It's got a bit like my doodah. My, you're very talented! I wonder where you get that from? Do you know you're going to be a famous artist one day? - Yes. - I think I'm going to frame my coat. I think it was good to meet you tonight. - You're going to make me a lot of money. - This is some of my oil pastels. Oil pastels! Oh, excuse me gents. I'm safe. I'm on the train. No, no! I had a very lovely evening. I just only got tired, thats all. I'm not fibbing. Thanks, you'll see that you're the pretty one and I'm quite content to be your wingchick. Foxy fox! Are you finished with this? Thank you. - Don't touch the door! - Harry's foraging. Well, Harry can forage on the seats 'cause those are marshlands and the doors are cliffs. Oh, I know. I was a bore. Tickets please! Excuse me sir. Can you put it out now please? The bar is closed. Doesn't matter. Can you put it out now? Look, there's signs everywhere inside the train. If you cannot read, it means "no smoking". Open the fucking bar! Open the fucking bar! You don't swear at me! And if you don't put it now, I'll personally arrange for transport police to escort you off train. Thank you very much! What are those? - Excuse me sir. Leave it to me! - Camel Light. Oh Camel Light. Really? I thought that was a student cigarette? Come on now, put it out. We don't want your secondhand smoke. Take it from me. I will be in the bar! Right now I'm sitting. Alright? Bye. I didn't buy ticket! Tickets, please! - What's his diagnosis? - He's crazy. Max! Max! What did I tell you? What did I just tell you? These doors are dangerous, Max and you never touch them. You never touch them! Give me Harry. I've had enough of him for one day. Just sit there and don't move! Those doors are dangerous, monkey. And if you fall out of them while the train is moving, then you'll be killed. Do you understand me? - Do you understand? - Sorry. You scared me. Tickets, please. Thank you. I suggest your boy sits on the aisle side in future, unless you plan on bringing your own child seat. Thank you. Madam, ticket please! Pity no one thought about putting automatic locks on these doors. Actually why bother with doors. Why not use net curtains? Madam, are you his mother? - My mum died. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Tickets, please! She didn't say goodbye. Yup! Why don't you get some sleep. - She was nice. - Mmm. Still going to make it in 47 minutes? Give or take a few seconds. I thought you got off. - I went to get some water for the coat. - Aah. I think we're the last people on this train. Yep. - Where are you getting off? - Tonbridge Wells. You? - Tonbridge. - Last chance for some shuteye then. - Not like you can nod off at work like I do. - Hmm. - What do you do? - Events management. I manage events. - You do not want me to tell you how boring it is. - OK. Don't tell me then. Your job is exciting. You get to help people. You're making a difference. - I'd get a lot from that. - Oh sure. Grey hair, sleepless nights. Very rewarding. I abandoned my friends tonight. - Isn't that awful? - Well, it depends what they did. - Trying to cheer me up. - How dare they! No. I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago, so they organised a night on the town in London town. Cocktailing, clubbing, you know, the whole shebang. What a chore. - You'd be surprised. I can't do it anymore. Could you? - Me? A single dad with a seven year old tender and a chance to party all night? Hmm. - Aren't you going to sit? - No. No, no. I'm warming my legs up. ED's a war zone this time of year. - Warm up on me. - Excuse me? - Guess my condition. - Oh! OK. - Heart murmur. - Nice guess! That's talent. Aah, after a seven-year old, it's entertainment. And how would you know for certain? Well, first, I'd check your fifth intercostal space, your middle auxiliary point. - And remind me where that is again? - It's right about here. So just under my left breast. And then, I would feel for a palpable murmur, or a thrill. - It's what we call it. A thrill. - You'd feel me for a thrill. Then I would send you for an echo cardiogram. You know I don't think this stain is coming out. I'd like to take you up on your offer, if it still stands. Or you can buy me a new coat with your doctor's salary. Shall I give you my number? Sarah Barwell? You could be a doctor with handwriting like this. Funny or rude. I can't work out what sums you up best. Yeah, all my patients have that problem. And do any of your patients get to call you by your first name? Oh, only special cases. Lewis. Well you get some rest, Lewis. I'll wake you before Tonbridge. Sarah. Gosh, I'm so sorry! I just closed my eyes for a few seconds. - Have we missed your stop? - No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's Max, do you mind keeping an eye on him for a minute? - No, of course not. - Actually I'm going to try and find the guard. - If he wakes up, can you just tell him... - You've gone to find the guard. Yes. There's nothing to worry about. Hello? - What do you think you're doing? - Have you seen the guard? Are you looking for an upgrade? There is someone hurt outside. Might be on the tracks. Maybe hit by the train. Well, there's a first. Someone throws himself in front of the train and it's not delayed? - Have you seen the guard? - And what could he do about it? He could give you a 50 pound fine for pulling that, I suppose. - It's an emergency. - An emergency? Where? Are we on fire? There's a guy outside. I'm trying to let the driver know. What's he going to do? Back up and give mouth-to-mouth? Why not wait until we're outside this tunnel and then call an ambulance? Well? What are you waiting for? Hi! Ambulance please! Hi, yeah. I'm on a train. There's been an accident on the Hastings line somewhere between Seven Oaks and Tonbridge. Well, there's someone outside on the tracks, badly hurt. I can't find the guard! Lewis Shaler, I'm an A&E consultant at Tonbridge. I'm on my way there now. Yeah, no please do, because they're going to have to blue light the man, he's... - OK, thanks, thank you. - You're on your way to A&E, doctor? Traffic accident, the registrar's sick and we're snowed under. Where's your receptionist? Legless in a boozer beef, felt up under the mistletoe, I imagine. Goodnight. - Oh, can you do that one? - Yeah! - This one. Look, look. - I'll try. - You didn't look very amazed by that. - Normally people are wowed. - Nearly. - I don't know how to do it. - Can you do this one? Try it faster. You are so sweet! - It's dad, do this! - It's just a little party trick. - What? Did you find the guard? - Don't run, Max! You know I haven't heard a hilarious quip from you in several minutes. I'm a bit concerned. - OK, I just saw someone outside on the tracks. - On the tracks? Doing what? - Crawling. - Crawling? Where? - Along the tracks. - I don't get it. Who is it? - I don't know. Max, wait! Sorry to bother you, but have you seen the guard? No. - Is anything wrong? - No. Thanks anyway. Hello there! - How old are you? - Max! Keep gloves on and your hat. OK. This is ours. Will you be OK? I think so. Better not leave that heart murmur too long though. Heh. - Bye then. - Bye. You have my number. I suppose you're going to have to work a lot harder for the next one. I don't believe it. The train didn't stop! Dad, the train didn't stop! I know. I know. 11:10, Charing Cross to Tunbridge Wells. Tonbridge. - Where are you going? - I'm going to have a word with the driver. All the way to the front again? My knee hurts. Your knee doesn't hurt. - He can stay here if he's tired. - Oh we don't have first class tickets. Neither do I. No guard to worry about, apparently. Oh well, my knee hurts too. Isn't that funny! And I'm armed to the teeth with party tricks, so you can run along. - Dad never runs anywhere. - Oh, they're gorgeous! Max, look! - Otter for Leah, penguin for Jake. My grandchildren. - Sit down then. But, the seats are purple. Purple is for girls. Oh don't be daft, pink is for girls, not purple. No, purple is for big strong men! Like Batman. Alright stand then. It's up to you. I'll be right back! Max, this isn't just any purple. This is Imperial Purple. Don't you know where it comes from? A rare sea snail, that clings to the rocky shores of the remote islands off the coast of Morocco. Africa! In ancient times, it was worth more than its weight in gold because it was the colour of Roman royalty. It was the colour of immortality. ... and I'll get in when I get in. I don't know. Listen, I'm stuck on a train. I can't do any better than that. Hello? Hello? Is the driver there? I really need to speak to someone. Is the driver there? This is one of your passengers. How many are left? - Is this the driver? - Passengers. - What? - How many passengers? There's six of us! Now listen, some of us wanted to get off at Tonbridge, and there was someone on the tracks. Hello? Hello! And then there's this picture. And he's going to sew the leg back on to him. I'm an A&E doctor and I have to get in to the hospital! There's been a traffic accident! I'll call the police! Steady. I'm already one step ahead of you on that! - He just went past my stop! - You didn't find a guard, then? No, all I found was his ticket machine. - And what, do you think that was him outside rolling around in the dirt? I don't know but there's something up with the driver. I'd say he's just ignoring you. I would if I were him. He just spoke to me. He asked me how many passengers were left. And when I told him about the guy outside, he hung up. What, he spoke to you? - There's an intercom in the guard's box. - And who said you could go in the guard's box? - The guard leave those too did he? - What? - Those keys. - What, these keys? Tell you what. Why don't I call the police right now and tell them what you're up to? OK? - Good thinking! This isn't funny! Jesus Christ! Don't do that! That's my stop! Hey! What are you doing? What? What? What is it? Take your pick. Stuck needle or no pressure in the brakes? Oh my God! Step over. After you. Buy me a beer. - Don't these stop the train? - In theory! Everyone knows pulling the communication post stops the train. Everyone! Everyone is wrong! No way to disable the brakes from the outside? No, not while the train's moving. - Earlier when the train stopped, I saw someone out there. Yes, yes, you keep saying that. Not the guy who was hurt, not him. - Before that, just before that. - Where? - Somebody was hurt? Outside. He was doing something to the train. I thought he was a railroad worker. But he was... - There was a hissing sound like... - Like air coming out of the brakes. - What did he look like? - He was wearing a high-vis jacket. I don't know, it was dark. - What? - What have you got on there? - You like? - It's very fetching. Do you work for the railway? No, London Underground. - Doing what? - Cleaner. - Have you seen the guard recently? - No. Have you? - What's your name? - Who are you? Police? What is your name? Peter Carmichael, and this is Dr Lewis Shaler. - Jan. - Jan who? - Klimowski. And I have not been outside. I'm sorry. Whose accusing you of anything? You! You know who I think let air from brakes? The same person now driving the train. Transport Police! - Where's Max? - He's fine. He's with Elaine. We have to call... what's going on? - I thought this was a stopping service. - So did I. Well, why don't we just pull the brake chain? We did. We tried the emergency brake, and the guard's van, and all the chains on the way here. - Dude! Can I pull this? - Go ahead! - I will you know. - They don't work. - This is the train to and from Tunbridge Wells. - Yes. So the rear driving cab should be the same as the front one. - Please tell me there's a brake in there. - Let's hope so. - He's not tired, your boy? - No. He's not my boy. - You're not married? - Not yet. We just met. - You just met tonight on this train? - Mm-hmm. - And he leaves his boy with you? - I'm not as dangerous as I look. Why do you come to back of train? Why don't you go to driver's door? I already tried that, it's jammed. - Leave that door alone! - You speak to police? They're contacting the driver direct, and they warned all of us against doing anything that could jeopardise their efforts to stop this train. It was open! I can't see anything. Do you have a lighter? Jan. - So we're ignoring the police then, are we? - Yes, fuck the police! - That's Tunbridge Wells, that's my stop! - The last stop. - No police! Let's give them a chance. I only just told them! Be all the way to Hastings as long as their arse is in gear. - OK, so where's the brake? - Well, that's not it. No, that one tells the driver that we're back here! - What about this one? - That's the dead man's handle, - ie touch it and your a dead man! - Hey boys, everyone gets a go, alright? - Lewis, the keys. - Yes keys. Try the keys. - These are just door keys. - That's because the driver has the driver's keys. But if you won't listen to the police, then all they need to do is cut the power to the third rail and we roll safely to a stop. No, we won't. It's not the anti-bloody Hebrides, Lewis. - This is electrified line down here. - It's a diesel train. Look! - So they can't cut the power? - Well they can, but it won't stop us. - So how can they stop us? - I don't think they can. We'd like to get off the train now! We'd like to get off now! Lewis! Lewis, put light here! This is back door. If we can open it, we can jump. And hopefully have a heart attack before we hit the ballast at 70 mph. We can run off the back! Who can run off the back? A little boy? Elaine? What is other choice? Then you fill out a donor card - before you jump off the train. - OK! You stay and I'll jump! - Boys!! - Go ahead Jan. - Trains don't have steering wheels. Handbrake. "Use only when train is stationary." And you think that a handbrake will stop a speeding train? I don't know what's going to stop a speeding train. When we're off this thing, I'll gladly tell the police that you were against us coming in here. - But it's a diesel train and I don't see how they can stop it from the outside. - Yes, let him try! - Don't shine that in my face! Don't touch me! Come on! What was that? Come on! - It's working! It's working! - It's working. Ha ha! He's fighting us! But we fight back! - How fast? How fast now? - 80. 85. 90. - 95. - Too powerful. - 100. - This is dangerous and illegal! Get off! Get off that. Ow! [Indistinguishable shouting] - Is that all you've got? - Alright! Alright! Take it easy! - Help me! Help me! It's burning! - It's smoke. - Help me unwind it. No wonder the Soviets want you, .........! So the police said do nothing? What can they do? They'll contact us if they need to. - Breathe through that nostril. - That one? They're fine. Just stay standing and keep pinching it, just by the bridge. - Have they spoken to the driver? - They're working on it. But you heard his voice so we know he's conscious. The question is - why is he doing this? When he spoke to me, he asked me how many passengers were left. We should break his door, smash his face. Then he will tell us. Yeah, we'll need a battering ram to get through. Perhaps we can try your head. In the absence of any sensible ideas, we're just going to have to wait for the boys in blue. Where are we now? I think we're approaching Stonegate. There is a level crossing after Stonegate. The barriers will be down, won't they. - Only if they're expecting us. I wish you would stop talking. - Well, they're automatic, aren't they? - Some are, some aren't. If it's manual, then there's a red light and it's up to the driver to stop the train. If the brakes are even working. - If we hit car, we come off track. - Very funny, Jan. A 100 miles an hour! Just call the police to make sure the barriers are down. How far from Stonegate to the level crossing? There's a tunnel just after the station, and the crossing is a couple of miles after that. So what's that? At 100 mph, that's 80 seconds. - For God's sake. Hi, monkey! You beat my high score yet? - Keep trying. - The snake goes too fast. Yes, hello! Police. Why was that man calling the police? Because there's something broken on the train and the driver needs to fix it. If it's broken, how does it keep going? Because it's only the brakes that are broken, Max. Is that why we didn't stop? The driver's going to fix it, Max. It's just like when I fixed your bike brakes. Remember that? But how can he fix the brakes if the train can't stop? Do you want me to show you how to win Snake or not? Come this side Max. Come, come, come! You don't have to move forward! Sit this side, Max! - Hey Max, this side is better. What have I told you? You do as you're told! Do you know, we pulled the communication cord and nothing happened! Listen. Listen to me! I have to tell you we are fast approaching Stonegate, and if those barriers aren't down, then you lot are going to need counselling when you sift through the mess! Hey! Hey! Close the crossway! Hey! Don't worry, Dad. They'll fix the brakes. You're right monkey. It's crazy to worry. Here, take Harry. And let's... Let's play a game. Let's play put your feet and knees firmly together on the floor. How about "Simon Says"? Simon says: Put your feet and knees together like this. - A little bit further back. - You didn't say "Simon says". Simon says: Bend down as far as you can and put your hands behind your head. We're all going to sit like this for a bit. - And close your eyes. - Simon says: Close your eyes. Dad? Jesus. - Did you get the police? - Yes, but they were too late to do anything. Let me think for a minute. Elaine, are you alright? - What? - What did she say? That the otter's for Jake and the penguin's for Leah. Oh. Oh Elaine!. You alright? You with me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Elaine? Elaine! OK, give me a hand to get her down. - She's in cardiac arrest. - Oh my God! - Check her handbag for pills! There is no pills! There is no pills, Lewis. - Lewis what can we do? - Does anyone else know how to do CPR? - No! - Sarah? No, I'm sorry I don't... I didn't... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven- eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Come on, Elaine! Come on! Come on! Nearly ten minutes, Lewis. - How long are you going to do this? - Let him do it. I am going to go to front to break driver's door. I need your help! She needs his help! She's dead! "Home". Give it to me. How long till end of line? At this speed if we don't run into anything, maybe half an hour. - Maybe half an hour. Maybe. - We can't just leave her. What about us! Lewis, what about your boy? Lewis, does she have any chance? - If I had a defib. - But you don't. Come on! We have no time! - You couldn't save her Dad? - No Max, I couldn't. If you were at the hospital, you would have. Knock, knock. OK Lewis, my turn. Come on! OK Lewis, let me. Let me. Let me! Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome on board train to Tunbridge Wells! Tonight we stop to let some passengers off. Some passengers we do not let off! They must stop train themselves! Open that door! OK, give me a couple of seconds, I will try again. Again! Again! Again! Again! Again! Whoo hoo hoo! Wow! - Wait! Wait! - What? Nothing. - Jan, this was your idea. It was your idea! - OK. Can you help me? - Ah! - Are you OK? - Yeah. I'm OK. Fuck! Give me a lamp. I found the guard. Open the door! Open the door! Look. OK look. Just... whatever it is you're doing, just please stop the train and let us off! I'm begging. I'm begging. My son is on the train. My son. He... I'm coming in! I'm serious, I'm coming in! Oh Christ! Jesus! - I'm fucking serious! - Lewis, it will blow up in your face! I'm serious! Open the fucking door, you fucking bastard! - Lewis! Lewis! - Open the fucking door! Jesus, fuck! - I need your pole. - You're bleeding. - I need the pole. Fuck! You bastard! Why are you doing this? Why are you fucking... - Lewis. - He's right there. - I know. - He's right there. Right there. I know. I'll kill him. Jan. What are we going to do? What do we do? What do we do? First we think. OK. We do stupid things when we don't think. Then, we try something else. Come on. You're a crazy fucker! 'Course it's like the Black Forest down here but I did manage to glean a few things before losing them. And they're working on something a bit further down the line. - And they found the driver. - Where? Just as you said, Lewis, on the track. Said he'd been attacked by somebody on the train. - I think I saw him earlier. - You saw him? - Yeah. I recognised his motorcycle helmet. That's right. He nearly got off at London Bridge, like he'd missed his stop. I think this guy kills the guard, he drags him in there, and then he pulls the emergency brake, which still works. And then he lets the air out of the brakes, jumps into the driver's cab throws him outside. I heard them shout. And... Do any of you remember Moorgate? Ah no, too young. It was about 30 years ago. A crash on the underground. Northern Line. When the train came into the station, instead of slowing down, it accelerated into the buffers. The driver was killed along with 40 other souls. They never proved what caused it, but speculation at the time was rife that it was suicide. Driver suicide. - How long from end of line? - About 20 minutes. - What is after that? - The great blue yonder. We could start fire outside his door. Smoke bring him out like in back. - Diesel tanks are under there. - Even better, we blow up the bastard! At this speed, we'd derail. So what do we do? We sit here? We do nothing? Jan, just listen to me please. Now I doubt you were here for the Paddington crash, but their diesel tanks ruptured lit a rate of sparks and a fireball the length of the train. And when it reached the passengers they all screamed. Do you know how they know that? Because the insides of their mouths were burned out. Thank you very much, "Mr Train Crash". - Look! "Buckeye coupler". - "Buckeye coupler". Buckeye coupler. It holds the carriages together. If we could get to it, we could, I don't know, we could unhitch it? - I know this. You pull here. - You pull at this? Yes. When you push lever, this comes out. How you say [points to knuckles] zglavci? - Knuckles. - Yes, knuckles comes loose. This makes connection not safe. Then it just needs shake... What, just like that, with all this load on the coupling? This train weighing hundreds of tons. Load is on coupling, not on pin. Without pin, it's not safe. At this speed, train shaking, it will come open. I am graduate of engineering from University of Technology, Gdansk. So we uncouple the carriages, put the rear handbrake on and, with luck, roll to a gentle stop. Not bad. Where is this coupling? Just under here. - Well there's no getting through there. - I will get to it. - Not without a sledgehammer, you won't. - I will go outside. - What do you mean you'll go outside? - My English not good? - I said I will go outside! - Jan, we're not on a cruise ship. You can't just saunter out on deck. How will you get out? Same way I got in, through door! Of course, through the door. How silly of me! And what are you going to do then? Just float around outside? There is small step! - I saw the running board, Jan, and it's 2 inches wide. As much as that? Oh, I'm sorry. Access too easy for you? Maybe we should blindfold you, put ferrets down your pants and tie one hand behind your back? What is ferret? Once you're out there in the pitch black, freezing cold, moving at 100 miles per hour with nothing to hang on to, how do you propose unhitching the coupling? Have any better idea? Tell me. Tell me! - Just hang on. - You are going to keep talking? - Just shut up and listen will you! - Fucking kurva! Jan. Once we get past Crowhurst, all these trains,they slow down. - Just shut up and listen will you! - Fucking kurva! Jan. Once we get past Crowhurst, all these trains,they slow down. How do you know trains slow down? Because I take the line a lot to get to the coast to visit my son. You compare very well with him. He doesn't like me either. OK, why trains slow down? Because after Crowhurst, the line becomes very poor all the way to Hastings. So if you're crazy enough to go outside, Jan, that's the time to do it. - This driver will not slow down. - Well then, he'll derail us if he doesn't. You said he wants to die. Of course he does, but what's the point of dying out here? Not nearly so dramatic as hitting those buffers in Hastings. Whoever this man is, he's got it all planned, and he wants to go out with a bang. And this? Well this is going to put him on the front page of every single newspaper in the land. I think we've got about five minutes before we get to Crowhurst and so, why don't I buy you a drink? Thank you. What are you thinking, Jan? I'm thinking how they will write this in newspaper. Have you ever been in newspaper? Yeah, well only local. Doesn't really count. - What for? - The Olympics. - The Olympics? - "The Olympics". Yeah. I won a couple of races for my university running club. - You said he never runs anywhere. - He goes old, huh? He got bad knees. He damaged his cruciate ligaments. Running was fine. Being a doctor was always the game plan. I followed in the parents' footsteps, and all. Oh, how lucky your parents were! My son wouldn't follow in my footsteps if I were leading him out of a burning building. He thinks I'm a dying breed. Given the circumstances, he could be right. What about you, Jan? Have you ever been in the paper? Back home, after I study engineering, I was magician. My parents still think I am magician. - Here in London? - Yeah, successful and famous. Is that what you told them? So what's going to happen when they find out? - I know tomorrow, when they fly here. - Oh yeah! Surprise Christmas trip. They're coming to see me in my big London show. They cannot wait to see their successful son. They are so proud that I am in newspapers, especially my father because when I tell him I want to be magician, he was not happy. What are you going to tell him? It's alright, monkey. It's alright. It's alright. He's trying to fix the brakes again, OK? - Why don't you show us a magic trick? - Of course. OK. Max, you know smoking is very bad. Some people even say that it will kill you. But you know the funny thing about people is that they keep doing things that is not good for them. And if people keep doing things that is not good for them, maybe one day they become extinct. Where is cigarette? Do you have cigarette? - Are you sure? - No, no, no. - Not in briefcase? - Mr Carmichael, you have cigarette! - No, no, no. - What about Sarah? You look so innocent. Do you have cigarette? Max, you have cigarette? You have cigarette here? You have cigarette here? What is this? What is this? It looks like Harry has cigarette. Maybe that is why Harry has become extinct. And sleep! And sleep! Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Great Klimowski. I'd keep moving, because at 70 the windchill is really going to bite. - Keep moving. - But don't move unless you have to. - Don't move. - And always keep three points of contact. - You are worse than my mother. - Come on, Max. - What's happening? - Where will you be? - I'm going to be that side. You ready for this? Like Houdini, I always do my own stunts. Monkey, go and sit with Sarah. Go on. Sit with Sarah, monkey! Simon says. Good luck! Jan! Jan! Are you OK? Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! - Lewis! - Jan! - Jan! Are you OK? - No! Not OK! Hang on! - Jan! Give me your hand! - I can't! Give it to me. Reach out. Just reach for my hand. - I can't! - Give me your hand! - I can't! - I'm right here. OK, I've got you! I've got you! Lewis! The track! A tunnel! There's a tunnel right ahead! Come on Jan! Come on! Hurry up! Come on! We're nearly there! - Come on! - Lewis! Jan? Jan! Jan. Can you hear me? Jan! Jan, can you hear me? Jan! Let's get you up. Come on. Is that OK? It's OK. You just sprained it, Jan. - Keep your arm in there and don't move it. - Fucking hell! You're going to be fine. Those things will kill you. Oh, for God's sake! Can't make you quit, can we? Cement. It's probably their idea of a barricade. - I wish they had used sandbags. - It's probably all the army had. Hang on. They may have thought this through. He's stopped. I take it back. It's a single track tunnel. Max! Max, come here. Come here! Come here! I want you to climb down. I know it looks scary, but you have to go because the train's not safe. Why can't I stay with you? Because I just told you, the train isn't safe. I don't want to. Don't start! What have I told you? What have I told you? You do as you're told. Come on Max. Max! Lewis! Max! - It's alright. It's alright! - I'm scared! Lewis, he's terrified. Think of what you're doing. - He is safer off the train. - Please no Dad, don't! Please. I beg you! I want to stay with you! - I know monkey. - Take Harry away! I'm sorry I played with the door! - I won't do it again! Please Daddy. - Lewis, stop! - Listen to me. - Please Max. You just... - Think what you're doing! - I know what I'm doing! I need you to get off the train. Come on. Get off the train. Listen to your Dad, please. - I know, I know. - No, Daddy! No! - Max. - Lewis! Stop! - Lewis! - I'm trying to help him! OK, fine. Never mind. It's alright. That's West St Leonards! Lewis! We have ten minutes. We will die on this fucking train! You think it's a good time to sit down now, Lewis? You don't think we should be doing something? You're going to climb outside the train, yes? No, let's make explosion. The train will come apart. Lewis! We have to try to do something, Lewis! The great Klimowski wants to blow up the train! - No, we should blow up the coupler! - We don't have any explosives! I have an idea. Down! Down! Down! Down! - Dad? - It's alright, monkey. Get back! Get back! If this works, we will be in newspaper. - We'll be in newspapers whatever happens. - Then we can't lose. Give me the lamp. Give me the lamp. Give me the lamp. I can see the coupling. Take this and get to the back. For the brake. You're a good boy, aren't you? Come on, Max. Come on! - Jan! Get to the back with Sarah. - Where are you going? Please Jan, just do as I say. Just for once, eh? Come on, Lewis! Give me room! Come on, you bastard! Free at last! Pull it, Lewis! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Jan! Help Sarah with the handbrake! Help Sarah with the handbrake! Get to the back of the train. The handbrake, at the back! Why are you standing there? I heard a scream! Lewis is OK. I need your help. - Come, come, come. - Max wait here! - Help me! Come on! Diesel. Fuck. How fast? - Oh, how fast? - 55, 50! Come on! 45! Fuck you! Fuck your fucking mother! Come on, Sarah! Come on! On your mark, get set... - Dad - Lewis? Lewis. - Dad. - Lewis. - Jan, can you see him? - Come on! Lewis! He's over there! He's over there! He's breathing! He made it, Max. He made it. Dad? Maybe if I had bought ticket, I could have got refund. It's OK, Dad. The ambulance is coming. You going to tell them you're going to the hospital tonight, aren't you? Subtitles by DB
