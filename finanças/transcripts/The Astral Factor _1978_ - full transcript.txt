(foreboding music) (intense music) (electrical buzzing sound) - What are you looking at? - You. Hey, what you been doing, man? It looked like your-- - Nevermind what it looked like because you didn't see anything, understand? - You don't tell me what I did and didn't see. I said it looked-- - Shut your goddamn mouth. - Those are some mighty big words for such a little boy. In fact, you best to be careful these next couple days because you're probably going to fall down, have an accident. (laughing) (high pitched sound) (shouting) (books falling and crashing) (yelling) (intense music) (yelling) Stop it goddammit. Just stop it. Stop it. Okay, Sands. Okay, Sands, all right. Okay. Sorry, man, whatever I did to upset you, man. I'm sorry. - Shut up Miller. You say one word about this, one word and I'll kill you. You understand me? You understand me Miller? - Okay, man, okay, anything you say, man, anything. Sorry. (electrical buzzing sound) (foreboding music) - Okay, Miller, that's it. I've had it with you. You're going into isolation for the next two weeks. Sands. (intense music) Sands, where the hell are you? Okay, what's going on here, Miller? (foreboding music) (jail cell door closing) Help. Bearden, get your butt down here. (jail door opening) (foreboding music) (heart beating) (heavy breathing) (foreboding music) (electrical buzzing sound) (foreboding music) - Roger? - Hello mother. - What are you doing here? - I came back. - Why aren't you at school? - I came back to see you. - Roger, you can't be seen here. I'm throwing a very important party. - No one must know you have a son. That's why I'm here mother. I'm sick of having to hide. - Roger. - I want people to know who I am. - No. - That I am your son. - Please. - That you are my mother. - I can't. - You are my mother. - Roger, stop it. Stop it Roger. - Hey, what the hell are you doing here? - What? - I said what the hell are you doing here? - Nothing, I'm not doing anything here. - Oh? You vandals are all the same, I know your type. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'm going to get the police up here. (high pitched sound) I'll get the police up here I tell you. No. I don't know who you are. (high pitched sound) (yelling) (groaning) - (laughing). (foreboding music) (high pitched sound) - (yelling) Oh no. No. - (laughing). (somber music) (tires screeching) (foreboding music) (buzzing electrical sound) (foreboding music) (heart beating) (heart beating) (heavy breathing) (foreboding music) (door closing) (laughing) Hello mother. - (screaming). (heavy breathing) (sound from TV) - (laughing) (phone ringing) Son of a bitch. Don't you ever give up? - Lieutenant Barrett? - [Barrett] Who'd you expect? - This is Davis. I'm sorry to disturb you lieutenant. - So why did you? - We have a 187. - Why call me? - Captain Wells wants you in on it, that's all I know. - [Barrett] Tell Captain Wells to shove it. - I'll tell him myself Barrett, just as soon as you get your ass in high gear. - Okay, okay. - Pick up Holt on the way. - Come on Captain, why Holt? (phone hanging up) Balls. (slamming phone down) - Ta-da. You said this was your day off. - Yeah, it was. - You haven't eaten any of your dessert yet. I'll save it for you. (laughing) Aren't you going to wear the boots I bought you? - No. - I thought you said you threw those old shoes out. - I lied. - Candy just wants you to look neat, that's all. - In the middle of the night, Candy? - You want me to wait up for you teddy bear? - No. - No. Okay for you. - Later. - Have a nice time. (foreboding music) - Empowerment strangulation Lieutenant. Her larynx appeared to be totally crushed. No doubt by a pair of large and extremely strong hands but don't quote me on that until after the autopsy. - Okay, Jim, get that report as soon as possible. - All right. - Don't forget that telephone. - Lieutenant, it's just like the front door, everything in this place is locked on the inside. It's really funny. - What's funny Sergeant? - [Sgt. Archer] Well, I mean, with all the windows and the doors locked from the inside, Lieutenant, will you tell me how the guy got out of here? - You tell me. Get all the information from her boyfriend? - Oh yeah. He's a little shook up, but I think he's in the clear. - Holt. - Kevin Kingsley was supposed to pick up the girl at nine o'clock, she didn't answer the door. Her car was still in the garage, she didn't answer the phone when he called the manager's office. He went up there and kicked in the door, he found the girl dead in the bathtub then he called the police with the phone in the den. Is that all right with you, Lieutenant Barrett, sir? - Was the manager with him when he busted in? - I forgot to ask. - Ask. - Yes sir. Hey, Lieutenant, she was with him when he broke in. - You a married man, Mr Kingsley? - I don't think I have to answer that question. - What? - Listen, Lieutenant, I'm not trying to be evasive, I'd like to avoid an ugly scandal if possible. - It's already ugly and I can make it a hell of a lot worse. - I've been seeing Miss. DeLong about six months but I assure you, there's never been the slightest complications, arguments, threats, marriage, none of those things. - Did she ever mention anyone giving her a bad time? - If you mean did men make advances to her, I suppose every man she encountered would like to have taken her out. - You know what I mean, Mr. Kingsley. Crazies, freaks. - She used to get obscene telephone calls from someone, but that stopped when she had her number changed and unlisted. (fingers clicking) - Phone free. - Mr. Kingsley, you can go. Don't get lost, I may need to talk to you again. (whimsical music) - This is a left thumb print we took from the bathroom door knob. This is one from the bedroom telephone. They're identical. This is Roger Sands' left thumb print. They're identical, Lieutenant. Roger Sands was definitely in Darlene DeLong's apartment. - Roger Louis Sands, Male, Caucasian, age 26, six foot, 165 pounds. Convicted four counts of first degree murder, sentenced to life imprisonment in the North State Institution For The Criminally Insane. - I studied this case in college. We called it Celebrity Strangler. His victims were all well known, actresses, foxes, the models, that type. In fact, his first victim was his own mother, that glamor girl in the 50s, Carlotta Sands. - Now I know why I asked the captain to put you on this case, Holt. - Darlene DeLong was a key witness at the Sands trial. He'd made an attempt on her life. There are two others that we know of. It's all here in this file. Both of these young women came dangerously close to losing their lives. Roxane Raymond, a professional dancer and Christina Hartman, that year's Miss Galaxy, Sands actually got his hands on her. - Captain Wells, here's the report from Warden Bowman. - Thank you. Well, that confirms it, Barrett, Sands escaped less than 48 hours ago. - Escaped from a maximum security... Come on Captain, who let him loose? - Now, don't start that again, nobody let this one out. - What the hell's this supposed to mean? Escaped under mysterious circumstances. (foreboding music) (seagulls squawking) (car pulling up) How's it going, Sloan? - No sweat so far. - Who've you got out there? - [Sloan] Sergeant Archer and Kovacs is out on the beachfront. I think we've got the place pretty well covered, Lieutenant. - You better know it's covered. - [Woman On Speaker] Who's there please? - Lieutenant Barrett. I have an appointment with Mrs. Hartman. - [Woman On Speaker] Oh yes, she's expecting you. She is beside the swimming pool at the back of the house. (car engine revving) (parrot sounds) (mellow country music) (car door closing) (parrot sounds) - Are you my daddy? Ugly, ugly. (parrot sounds) - Mrs. Hartman? Mrs. Hartman, Lieutenant Barrett. I believe you got a call from my office. - Would you please tell me why those men are spying on me? It's David, isn't it? Playing one of his stupid little games again. - David, your husband? - Yes, my goddamned husband. Hey, say, you don't look like a detective. - Your husband has nothing to do with this Mrs. Hartman. You remember a man named Roger Sands? The night before last, he killed a girl named Darlene DeLong. - Oh my god. Oh my dear god, that poor girl. He's out of prison? - We have four men on duty around the clock. - That's good. What about that other girl? She was a dancer, Roxane. - Yeah, Roxane Raymond. We're trying to locate her now. - Would you like a drink Lieutenant? - It's a little early in the day for me. - Yeah. Well, I think I'm going to have another one. You just took the edge off this one. Excuse me. (birds chirping) - Where's your husband now, Mrs. Hartman? - Try Chris. My husband? I don't know. I never know half the time. In Europe some place, France or Spain. You see, David's a habitual globe trotter. He collects visas like some men collect stamps. - And good beauty. You live here all alone? - Yeah, except for my housekeeper. It's a real drag you know. - Yeah, I bet. - I think I'm going to buy myself a puppy. Oh, I did love it at first, oh, sure did. David and I spent much more time together then. Had lots of parties and friends. Took me with him everywhere. We traveled to Europe, met lots of important famous people like dukes and princesses and ambassadors and even the queen. - Sounds like you had it all. - Yeah, I guess I have, but I don't anymore. David now treats me like I'm just another trophy in his collection. And you know what happens to yesterday's trophies, Lieutenant, they get dusty. - Are you still in love with him? - I guess so. I think so. I don't know. (phone ringing) Hello. Hold on. - Barrett here. - Hey, Lieutenant, I've already located Roxane Raymond. She's rehearsing a new show at the West Valley Fair. (laughing) Wow, is it a wild number. We're searching her place now. - Okay, you stay on top of it till I get there. - Right. Lieutenant. Hey, lieutenant. Hey, look, how you doing with Miss Galaxy? I hear she's really (whistles), huh? - Buddy, you've finally got something right. (hanging up phone) Roxane Raymond's okay. - Oh, that is great. - Okay. Now, you take care of yourself. - Lieutenant, can't you stay a while? I mean, I could make us a nice seafood salad with a real special sauce, huh? - How about a rain check? Mrs. Hartman, watch out for your friend here. - Oh. - [Dance Instructor] Up, down, five, six, seven, eight. Now darlings, let's try it again and right this time. (clapping) Take it from the top. - [Roxane] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, five, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, six, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, seven, two, three, four. - Five. - Lights and first act curtain, (foreboding music) and that's it kids, take a break then we'll run through the second act. Roxane, darling, please, please, please try to pick up your queues, you know we open in three days. (foreboding music) - Roxane, what's the matter? - I don't know. I suddenly got goosebumps. - Tell me doctor, did Sands ever discuss any of his victims with you? - Yes, quite freely on occasion. In one way or another, each of these young women remind him of his mother. They were all cover girls you know? Celebrity magazine. In his mind, each time he kills, he actually believes he is killing her all over again. I'm afraid unless Roger Sands is stopped, he will be compelled to continue killing every woman who reminds him of his mother. - What are these books here in his cell? - I believe he's read every book in the prison library. - Yeah, but what are these? - Sands is well educated, you know, actually, brilliant in some ways. It's not unusual in the case of the homicidal schizophrenic. - Did he ever mention any friends or did he write letters to anybody? - No, Roger Sands lived within himself. That's a basic symptom of his psychosis. His mother, not wanting it known that she had a child, prevented him from developing any friendships. - That doesn't help us a hell of a lot. - [Wells] Does Sands have any interests, sports, automobiles, political organizations, anything at all? - Yes, psychic phenomena. It was his major preoccupation. Obsession I should say. - Are you suggesting that's how he escaped. - I'm simply suggesting that Roger Sands was experimenting with ESP. For instance, I once found him in a total cataleptic state. He was lying on the floor of his cell, as rigid as this desk, we at first thought he was dead, but the medical staff detected a heartbeat. After about 20 minutes, he came out of it. (sighs) - I don't see how that's going to help us find the bastard. - [Doctor] The ESP research institute seems to think it might. They've had a team of parapsychologists studying the case since it reached us. You've no doubt heard of Darwin Van Cott? - Psychometrist? - Yes. Well, he and Doctor Ulmer, the head parapsychologist from the institute, spent considerable time in the subject's cell where Van Cott could be in physical contact with the object used by Roger Sands. I taped the session, would you care to hear it? - Yes, please. - [Van Cott] Yes Doctor Ulmer. I seriously believe this Roger Sands could be here in this room with us and we would be unable to see him. - Doctor Jacobs, could you play that again? - Certainly. - [Van Cott] Yes, Doctor Ulmer, I seriously believe this Roger Sands could be here in this room with us and we would be unable to see him. (upbeat music) (car engine starting) (car door closing) - [Holt] Carlotta Sands, married at the age of 17, had one child, one Roger Louis Sands, became instant star in her first picture, aged 19. She dumped her husband. Not remarried, but man, did she ever keep the scandal seats alive with her active... I think that's mine. I had the one with the mustard. Carlotta Sands, regretted having a child, got in the way of her social life. She kept her son in boarding school most of the time away from her friends all of the time. Carlotta Sands, strangled to death in the bedroom of her West Park mansion six years ago by one Roger Louis Sands. Since that time, the estate has been in the hands of the probate court. (tires screeching) (engine revving) (car door opening) (car doors closing) (foreboding music) (bottle dropping) (foreboding music) - Stop it. Why are you acting this way Roger? - Because you are my mother. - God, you're such a child. Don't you see what it would do to us if people find out about you? - Where do you get this us stuff, mother? All you've ever cared about was you. What it will do to you. You can't get any worse from me. It's like I've been invisible all my life. Well, I just can't do it anymore. - Roger, I've had enough trouble as it is. If people find out I have a son your age, it will ruin me. - Then get ready to be ruined mother because I'm busting this thing wide open. - I wish you had never been born. (slapping sound) (dramatic music) (gasping) - You're going to wish you'd never been born. (door opening) (foreboding music) (buzzing electric sound) - She was really something, wasn't she? Amazing how many broads like her got all screwed up. Wind up just another vital statistic. - Let's start with the bedroom. (foreboding music) (smashing sound) (heart beating sound) - Look out. (smashing sound) (smashing sound) (gun fire) (smashing sound) (gun fire) (foreboding music) (door breaking open) If someone was in here, how the hell did they get out? (chair falling over) - Get out in the car and call in a search assist, I want this whole area cordoned off. - Yes sir. (kicking around objects) (smashing glass) (foreboding music) (smashing glass) You two go over that side. Hunt, you go up by the pool, okay? I've got them spreading out all over Lieutenant. - You ever hear of a Colleen Hudson? - Yeah, she's a socialite, always making news of the international jet set. - Find her and fast. Put on your protection. She may be the next one up. - Yes sir. (car door closing) (police car siren) (birds chirping) (dog panting) (foreboding music) (dog growling) (dog barking) - What is it Prince? (dog barking) There's nothing there. Now, you behave. (dog barking) Prince, quiet. Now, down. Prince, come back here. (mumbles). Prince. (intense music) (dog barking) (dog yelping) (heavy breathing) (heart beat) (intense music) (screaming) (slapping sound) (crying sound) - [Sands] You were my mother. (car brakes screeching) (dog barking) (water dripping) - Candy. (foreboding music) (screaming) - Candy wanted to surprise you. - Candy did. (laughing) Candy, I've had a hell of a day. - Oh. Did you call your mother? - Call my mother? - It's your birthday. - Already? - You should call your mother. - Candy, I don't call my mother on my birthday. - I always do. - Yeah. - Candy has another surprise for you. (laughs) - Save me. - Come on, sit down over here and close your eyes. Come on. Hurry up. Are you sitting down? - No, not yet. - Are your eyes closed? - No, not just-- - Hurry up. (laughing) - Okay. - Ready? - Ready. - Ta-da. Happy Birthday. - That's really something. - You see, I told you I was good at something else. - Did you make that? - From scratch. I've been slaving away in the kitchen all day. - (laughing) - Go on, blow it out. Make a wish and blow out the candle. Come on. Yay. Cheers. - (laughing) - And now, Candy is going to cook you a birthday dinner. - Really? - Would you like chicken and giblets or fillet of salt? (crashing sound) Oh. - How about macaroni and cheese? Is that a new coat? - Ah yes, it's your birthday present to me. Did you catch your maniac yet? - No. - [Candy] Oh, that's too bad. Well, maybe you'll get him tomorrow. How is it? Oh, good. What's his birth sign? - Whose birth sign? - Your maniac. - Candy, I don't know his birth sign. - Oh, you don't? - No. - Oh, okay. - (laughing) I don't believe you. Are you for real? - You want me to prove it to you or something? - (whistling) (laughing) To you nutso. - (laughing) (foreboding music) - Hey you. (car door closing) What are you doing back here? Theater's closed. - I work here. Yeah, I'm a stage hand. - Theater's still closed. Come over here. (high pitched sound) (car engine revving) You stay right there. (tires screeching) (screaming) (high pitched sound) (screaming) (dramatic music) (heart beating) (heavy breathing) (tapping on door) (banging on door) - Come on. (banging on door) (tapping on door) (banging on door) - [Barrett] Christ. Okay, okay. The hell do you want? (door opening) Oh, it's you. - Sorry Lieutenant. - Have you ever heard of a telephone? - [Holt] Yeah. Been calling you for two hours, your damn line's been busy. - Okay, well, what is it? - Found Colleen Hudson in the morgue. - Strangled? - Yeah, Evergreen Park, same MO, no witnesses, no apparent motive, the body's covered with jewelry. - Any evidence? - Yeah, she had a guard dog with her, dog was clubbed to death, Roger Sands' prints all over the club. Look, the captain's pretty uptight Lieutenant, he told me to tell you he's giving you Russo and Harris, they're checking out the other girl. - That'll help. - He also told me to tell you to get your damn phone fixed. Hey, he said it, I didn't. - Want some coffee? - No thanks, you mind if I just flake out? - I said make us some coffee. I'm counting, Candy. I'm almost at 10. 10. - I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. - [Barrett] Candy, say hello to Sergeant Holt. - Hello, Sergeant Holt. (kicking can on floor) (slapping face) - Needed that. (dropping can) Come on zombie. I want to hear that door locked behind me. - Chuck, I've been thinking, don't you think it would be better if you got some other kind of a job? You know, like a bank manager or an engineer or something with normal working hours. - I'll give it some thought. Oh, could you water my plants today? - Have a nice time. (door closing) (water running) - Hey, Lieutenant, what's with the-- - Don't ask, Sergeant. What time is Roxane Raymond's dress rehearsal? - 3:30 this afternoon. - Okay, I'll see you then. Between now and then, don't let that girl out of your sight. - We've got three men in her apartment home. - I want you inside the apartment with her. Stick to her like a bandaid. When she gets to the theater, you eat with her, you ride with her, you take a bath with her if necessary. - Wow, what a place. - Hey, if Roxane Raymond gets hinky on you, you tell her we'll take her into protective custody. If you need me, I'll be at the ESP Research Institute. - Yes sir. (foreboding music) - Thank you Akeme. - So, that's psychokineses. - Well, one manifestation of it. Now, some psychics have the power to move objects from great distances. That's telekinesis. - Are you trying to tell... (laughing) Are you trying to tell me that a man could strangle someone from a distance? - Lieutenant, there are many mysterious phenomenon that can't be explained. My file cabinets are filled with records of them. The Bell witch of Springfield, Tennessee. A poltergeist responsible for the death of a member of the Bell family. The Charles King murder case of Canada. Now, the brother of this victim had a vision of the entire incident while asleep in his home in England. His description of the murderer lead to the arrest of the man even before news of the event had reached London. Now, these are all well documented cases. - Doctor Ulmer, all this is driving me up the wall. Now, if you people know something that'll help me find this guy, just give it to me straight. - Lieutenant, here at the institute, we investigate mysterious phenomena, we don't create it. - Okay. Okay. What did your psychic Van Cott mean when he said Roger Sands could be in the same room with you and you wouldn't be able to see him? - I don't know what he meant. - Well, you must have some theory about all this. - Yes, that's just what it is, theory. Some form of astral projection. Out of body travel, Lieutenant. (foreboding music) the astral traveler usually visits places and persons he knows. Distance seems to be no barrier. A great number of cases that are thoroughly documented on this too and as far as we know, the astral traveler's real body always remains at the place of departure. But who is to say that Roger Sands hasn't gone a step beyond, hop the silver cord perhaps, reached into some new dimension. - You really think that's possible, don't you? - Well, after 12 years with the institute, I'm convinced that if the will of the human mind is strong enough, anything is possible. - Yeah. Well, thank you for your time Doctor Ulmer. - Not at all and feel free to call me at any time. - Doctor Ulmer. Only a handful of people on the force know the details of this case. So far we've been able to keep those details out of the news. But, if the media should get wind of your theory, they'd make us look like a three ring circus, you know? - I understand. - What've you got Russo? - Lead on the other girl, Bambi Greer. She's an actress, big deal in the late 60's. - And she's living at the marina, the Dolphin Apartments, but she's not home. - Did you alert the department down there? - And the harbor patrol. - Okay, she's your baby, get on there and find her. Let me know as soon as you do. - You bet. (car engine starting) (car tires squeaking) (banging on car roof) (intense music) (foreboding music) (ice dropping out of glass) - Jo. - (laughing) - I'll get you. (mellow guitar music) ♪ Little girl, little girl ♪ ♪ Don't lie to me ♪ ♪ Tell me where have you been last night ♪ ♪ In the pines mama, in the pines ♪ ♪ Where the sun never shines ♪ ♪ And I shivered the whole night through ♪ (clapping) (strumming guitar) - Some pretty nice picking. - Thanks. I'm better at the piano, but then I should be, I started playing when I was seven years old. You know, when your parents are Norwegian and German, there's got to be music in the house. I'm glad you came by. It gets damn lonely around here sometimes, like now. Sit down. - Yeah, I must, but that's not why I'm here. - No, I didn't think it was. Too early in the day for you, I suppose. - Yeah, right. My men out front tell me you've been giving them a hard time. - Yeah, I guess I have. You know, when I get too lonely, or too upset, I usually take a ride up the coast with the top down, have lunch in Santa Barbara, dinner in Carmel. Nice. - Alone? - Yes, unfortunately, alone, Lieutenant. Drive kind of helps me get my head straight. You know, sometimes I drive up into the mountains, forest country. Boy, I love the smell of pine trees. Have you ever taken a pine needle and kind of bitten it and then smelled it? Wow. Reminds me of home. But those idiots out there won't let me go any place. Not even down to my own beach. - [Barrett] It's going to get worse before it gets better. I've got to take you into protective custody. - Like hell you will. I've had about all the confinement I can take, Charlie. - Just trying to keep you from getting yourself killed. - Well, if you think I'm going to sweat it out in some stinking little room, while you and your guys chase that nut, you're out of your mind. - Listen, I've just found out that we're not dealing with some ordinary... This Roger Sands, he's allusive as hell and until I know more about him, I need all the cooperation I can get. - Well, I'm going to stay right here and if you don't like it, you know where you can go. And you might just as well take those bastards out there with you. I want you all off my property, do you understand that? Do you? - All right. I'll give you a choice. Either you come with me or you stay locked in this house until I say it's okay. - You can take your choice and shove it. Okay? - Why don't you stop drinking that crap and grow up? - Now, where do you get off telling me how to live my life? - That's the way it's going to be Mrs. Hartman. Or I'll get a court order and haul your ass in. - Lousy goddamn police force. Get the hell out of this house. Get the hell out of this house and leave me alone. Get out of this house. (glass smashing) (mellow music) - Told you it was wild, didn't I? - You told me. Is that our girl? - Yeah. See, the witches are trying to catch her and then she's supposed to be sacrificed by that big demon guy up there. - [Barrett] You got anybody up there? - Bet your sweet ass. Yes sir. - How many stage hands? - There's six and I've got someone watching every one of them. - I'm going out the front. (foreboding music) (heavy breathing) (mellow music) (intense music) (screaming) (heavy breathing) (screaming) Don't anybody leave the stage. Cover the doors. (audience screaming) (police siren) (upbeat pop music) - Bambi, I want you to tell me what the hell you're mixed up with. - I told you. I'm not mixed up in anything. - Then why is the harbor patrol sitting out there on the deck of my yacht? - I don't know. - I ought to have my head examined fooling around with a girl like you. - Why are you so uptight? I'm the one they're worried about. - Why the hell are they worried? - Well, I don't know, Mario. I don't know. - So help me, Bambi. If you get me mixed up in some goddamn dirty mess, I'll see that you never work in another picture the rest of your life. - Big man. (slapping face) (smashing glass) - I've had it up to here with your music, your stupid music. (police siren) (pop music) (foreboding music) (water splashing) (police siren) (tires screeching) - She's aboard the yacht. The dock master here said they left early this morning. - Is she under guard? - I radioed the dock master before I put in the call for you. Harbor police over there should be aboard with her by now. I guess she's about as safe out on a yacht like that as any place Lieutenant. - [Barrett] I hope you're right, Sergeant. (boat engine revving) (foreboding music) (harpoon hitting) (upbeat electric guitar music) (door opening) - Who are you? What do you want? (foreboding music) (boat engine) (intense music) (boat engine) (intense music) (boat engine decelerating) (boat horn) - Bambi. Bambi. (foreboding music) (whacking sound) (upbeat electric guitar music) (boat engine) (boat accelerating) (police siren) (boat accelerating) (buzzing electrical sound) (dramatic music) (angry yelling) (gate opening) - Oh, here. (electrical explosion) - Is that hot enough to kill a man? - No, but it sure as hell will knock you on your ass. - How about the fence? - Well, breaking it sets off an alarm up in the house. - Her old man's a nut on security sir. - [Barrett] How's it going Kravatz? - [Kravatz] No problems yet. Good morning Captain. - [Wells] Morning. - You'd have a pretty tough time trying to make it up this way. - [Sloan] Kravatz, this is Sloan. Is the Lieutenant anywhere near you? - Yeah, Sloan, go ahead. - Utility Squad is here. - [Kravatz] You checked their I.Ds? - They're okay. - Let them in, lock the gate behind them. - Right sir. Come on boys. (gate opening) (engine starting) You're clear. - Do all the men understand what we're up against? - I told them everything I know. - I'm not so sure we shouldn't get that girl out of here. Put her on a plane to Europe or somewhere till we know what the hell this is all about. - I don't know, that wouldn't stop Sands from killing and it's not Christina Hartman, it'll be some other lady. - How's Holt working out? - Not as bad as I thought. But he's not as good as he thinks he is. Hell, you know, I'll probably be working for him five years from now. - (laughing) Okay Chuck, you've got the ball. (car door closing) (engine starting) (car accelerating) - We're tied into the 220 circuit in the utility room. - Is that enough? - More than enough the way we're wiring it. But it's got to make contact with the metal hand railing, Lieutenant. - Why don't you just wire the steps? - [Holt] What? You'd have to cover them up with metal plates, that'd be pretty hard to hide. - All right, Russo, as soon as they get that switch wired, you stay within hand's reach. If I give you the word to hit it, you hit it no matter what, okay? - Okay. - Remember, if you see anything unusual or hear anything unusual, let me know. - Right. (foreboding music) - Sloan. - Go ahead, Lieutenant. - Listen, it's almost dark. Call Archer, I want him to take over your station. I want you here inside. - Okay, Lieutenant. - On the double, Sloan. Holt. (snoring) Sergeant Holt. - What? Yes sir. - Take over here. I'm going up stairs. (door closing) (foreboding music) (heart beating) - Hi. Got all dressed up to have a little drinky with myself. - I told you to stay in your room with the doors locked. - When will you stop treating me like a child? I know what I'm doing, okay? - Yeah, you sure do. You're half smashed already. - Yes sir, Warden, Lieutenant. Pretty soon I'll be totally smashed. Your health. - Like hell you will. (slapping face) (glass smashing) Listen, Chris, just try to lay off that damn stuff, will you? I need your help. - Look, I'm sorry, okay. I really am sorry. I guess I'm just a little scared, Lieutenant, scared. - Hey, try Chuck, okay? - Okay, Chuck. - Did you reach your husband? - Yes, in Rome. He'll be here in the morning. - That's bad? - [Chris] I don't know. Hey, Chuck, may I ask you something? - [Barrett] Go ahead. - Do you think if I tried to be more like the girl he found in Green Valley, I could get him back? You know, a simple country girl in blue jeans and pigtails? - That's what you're worried about? Well, he must've wanted a country girl when he married you. It's worth a try. - I hope so. Because if that's what it takes, I'm sure going to do it. And then I'm going to take that son of a bitch for everything he's got. When I get through with him, he'll have to float a loan to make a telephone call. (phone ringing) - Yeah, Archer, what is it? - [Archer] Sergeant Davis is here. - Tell her to come up stairs through the patio entrance. (engine accelerating) (foreboding music) Davis is your baby sitter. You do whatever the hell she says. Understand? - Okay, Charlie. (parrot sound) - Hello sister, nice legs. (whistles) - You too junior. - [Parrot] You too junior. You too Junior. (foreboding music) (TV sound) (parrot sound) - Oh, put a lid on that bird. (parrot sound) - Come on. Want a drink? Want a drink sweetheart? - Shove it up. Goodnight sweetheart. (parrot sound) (foreboding music) - (laughing) (laughing) (dramatic drum music) (alarm going off) It's north fence. Stay here. (dramatic music) Sloan, come on. (electrical explosion) (gun shots) (gun shots) (dramatic music) (gun shots) (foreboding music) Sloan. Russo, pull that switch. Get Archer in here and put in a call for an ambulance. (foreboding music) (door knob turning) Come on, let's get Chris out of here. (shouting) - It's Harris. (crickets) (dramatic music) (glass smashing) - Archer, stand by on the patio. Holt, up stairs with Chris and don't touch that railing. Come on. (foreboding music) (gust of wind) - Just the wind. (foreboding music) (heart beating) - Holt. - [Holt] Where are you Lieutenant? - Bring round. (heavy breathing) - Roger? Roger? Roger, is that you? - [Sands] Yes, mother, I've come back (laughing) to see you. I am your son. You can't hide me anymore. I want everyone to know (gasping) that you are my mother. (screaming) (gun fire) (screaming) (electrical sounds) (buzzing sound) I never wanted to hurt you, mama. (explosion) (somber music) (door opening) (door slamming) - Hi teddy bear. (somber music)
