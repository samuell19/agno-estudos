THE ABSENT All right. Perfect. And why did you leave your last job? I didn't. We had massive layoffs due to a merger. I didn't... We had massive Iayoffs... How old are you, Laura? Julia. Julia, sorry. How many years? 12 years in the sector. 12 years in the sector. No, I mean your age. Thirty-five. Thirty-five. -Thirty-five. -Thirty-five. Don't worry, they've been on and off all morning. You're married, right? Any children? -No. -No. No... no... no. Well, you obviously have plenty of experience. But right now our policy is to hire younger people with less experience so we can mold them. I'm sorry, you're overqualified. I can pass your file on to personnel, but they'll say the same thing. We like training our own people. ...younger peopIe with less experience so we can mold them. I understand. SlX MONTHS LATER Hello? Hello? Who is it? Who was it? I don't know. I couldn't hear. It's almost eight. We should get moving, Julia. There's no hurry. We still have a lot of boxes left. I'm exhausted. How about putting me in one with the rest of the junk? Come on, let's go. Leave it, I'll do it. Don't treat me like a child, Samuel. Dad, my PlayStation won't fit. -Here, I'll take it. -Thanks. If I were a child I'd have a job. I can't find my bear. Help your brother find his bear. Come on. Julia, what about this? That stays here. Don't be like that. Why not try again after the summer? After the summer comes winter. Maybe you should aim lower. Come on, it doesn't matter. Felix, Luis. Come on. Everything okay? It makes me dizzy. Let's try to think about what's ahead. -You know it means a lot to me. -And to me. I want to enjoy it. That's more like it. You never give up, do you? You got what you wanted. -First one up picks his room. -Okay! Take it easy! Take it easy. Happy? Very. That's more like it. I'll get our things. -Chorizo for you. -Thanks. Turn that down. You'll go deaf. Here, Luis. Ham and cheese for you. Yummy! The second level's too easy, Dad. Try the sixth. Plates in the kitchen after. And clean up the playroom. Imagine you're not alone. There are others all around you. Monstrous beings. Samuel. Please. Julia, it's my job. And these are my advisors. Eat, advisor. We need to call the maintenance guy. I don't like being watched. They're not watching us, Julia. They're protecting us. Those Kosovar mafias can't get in here. Julia. Shouldn't you stop taking them? Yes. It's like a dream. What is? Having my own house, with the three of you inside. I couldn't have done it without you. You're brave, Julia. You'll find another job. A better one, you'll see. Everything will work out. I really want to love you. Come here. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Luis, Luis... I'm here, it's okay. Julia's here. It's over. It was only a dream. It's over. Breathe. They were ugly and they had huge hands, like a monster. And monster fingernails. But they've gone. Monsters can't get out of dreams. You wake up and they're gone. -l don't like it here. -Why not? It's nice here. We'll be happy. What was that? Nothing, sweetie. Let's go. Come on, Felix. Take the kids in our room. I'll look outside. Shouldn't we call the police? I'm just going to have a look. It's all right. Samuel? Samuel, is that you? Is everything okay? Cats. Cats everywhere. I yelled and scared them away. It's okay, Luis. Relax. Cats? We live in the country now. We'll have -to get used to it. -Stray cats. Nothing to be afraid of. Come on, it's okay. You shouldn't be scared. Go to bed. Go to sleep. Turn it down. More tea? More? Yes. Thank you. Your video games will drive them insane. This tea is delicious. You should open a teahouse. Who turned on the washing machine? Don't! Damn! Play outside. We live in the country now. This isn't the country. -lt's a suburb. -Go get some sun. We don't like the sun. We like ''Teken.'' Dad wants us to try his games. We're advertisers. -Advisors. -Yeah. Go outside. And don't fall in the pool. When will we fill it? Next week. Out! Come on, squirt. I lost track of time. The supermarket had closed by the time I realized. That's okay. Veggies are healthy. -Yeah, from a can. -Fine by me. I wanna go swimming. Keep quiet. That's enough. She forgets everything. No wonder -she can't find a job. -Hey. Felix, cut it out. What happened? I said, what happened? She won't let us play video games. Go on, eat. It's all right. Sometimes I can't stand you. Out! Go away! Out! Out! People around here don't feed their cats! Julia. Please. Don't be angry with Felix. Try to understand him. He can't get over it. -Apparently you can't either. -Julia... That's it, sweetie. There you go. Very good. That's it, Luis! Very good. Keep going. Luis, sweetie. Let me see. You're okay. Shit. What's wrong? The air conditioning doesn't work. The maintenance guy said there are problems sometimes. -l'll check the panels. -Why don't you call him? -Try calling him. -l don't have the number. I'll go talk to him. Julia, I'll take care of it. It'll do me good to get out. And we need the pool filled. Hello? Samuel! Where have you been all this time? I got lost. I saw the maintenance guy. He said the excess demand is overloading the grid. Anyway, they may take awhile. What's wrong? It's deserted. I was just there. So was l. And he was there. Something happened to me there. What? The doors moved by themselves. Julia, please. -l'm serious. -The maintenance guy. No, there was nobody there. Okay, tell me what happened. I don't know. There was something there. I swear. The doors moved by themselves. It was probably a breeze or something. Would you listen to me? Why did we move here? Don't use that tone with me. You're not even listening to me. I'm talking about moving doors. You want to talk about doors? Fine. What about all the doors we closed moving out here? What about all the doors we've opened together making that decision? We did it for everyone. The doctor said... Leave the doctor out of this. Listen to me. I was there. The doors were moving. Okay, let's go together. Let's make fools of ourselves one more time. Come on. Julia, everything is okay. We're fine. Don't you see? We're safe here. That's why people move out here, because nothing ever happens. There must be an explanation. Come on. -Are you sure? -Let's go home. Luis. Luis, wake up. We'll be late to swimming class. -Luis... -Good morning. Come downstairs. Breakfast is ready. Felix, hurry up. We'll be late to swimming. Felix. I'm finishing. Right now. Cool! It's gigantic! -They should be here by now. -Can I go in? No, wait for the monitors. Come on. You go ahead, we'll wait here. If nobody shows we'll take a swim and come straight home. No, we'll come back after the supermarket. Let us stay. It's hot. We're good swimmers. I'm not leaving you two alone here. Come on. Dad lets us swim alone. I can keep an eye on Luis. Come on, let us. We'll be fine. We can take care of ourselves. We're good swimmers. Pick us up after the supermarket. I promise we'll wait here. -Please... -All right. But wait here till I get back, all right? And watch your brother. No horsing around. Deal. Come on! Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Felix! Luis! Where were you? I looked everywhere. We had a blast. -Did you set the table? -What's for lunch? Did your dad bring you? When did you get here? Just now. Some kid's mom brought us. -They live here, too. -Here? Who? Where do they live? At number 25. They know Dad. They have a son my age. -l didn't know he knew people here. -Dad has friends everywhere, because he's nice. Relax, we didn't do anything bad. I told you to wait for me at the pool. We waited, but you didn't show. You were late again to the supermarket, right? That's it. You couldn't buy food. You're losing your mind. That's enough. Go to your room. You're grounded. -Why? I'm hungry. -Go to your room! You're not my mother. Go to your room! What did you get for lunch? The supermarket was closed. -l'm hungry. -Me too. I don't mind eating from a can again. Why didn't you wait for me? Don't you ever hit one of them again. I told you, I didn't hit anybody. That's not what they said. They're lying. We'll see about that. Felix, Luis. Come here. Sweetie, what happened? What happened to you? It was you. Luis. Who hit you, sweetheart? Tell the truth. Her. Why are you doing this? I swear I didn't touch him. I never would. They need a mother and I can't be that. Julia, that's enough. Eat your pizzas. You, go to bed early, you've caught a cold. Julia, don't start with that in front of the kids. It's Felix. He doesn't like me. I suppose they did this as well. You have to believe me. Julia... Why don't you tell the truth? You lost control and smacked him. It's no big deal. There's no need to lie. I'm not lying. It wasn't me. Julia, the supermarket called. They said you tried to leave without paying. That's serious. There was nobody there. It was deserted. -They said you ran off. -Who said that? It was empty. There was no one there. I bought food there just this afternoon. Where do you think I got the pizzas? There was nobody there, dammit! You always have an answer for everything. How can you be so relaxed? Don't you see there's something weird -going on here? -No. I don't see it, Julia. I don't want to see it. Do you think this is what I want out of life? A house in the burbs, video games, two kids to raise and a... This is all there is. This is all there is. You'll have to make an effort if you really want it to work. I want you to listen to me. You'll have to go back to your treatment. Two points. You don't have a fever. You'll be fine tomorrow. How do you feel? Forgive me? Felix hit me. He made me tell Dad it was you. We'll see. Are you leaving? Of course not. I'll never ever leave you alone. I promise. Go on, eat something. You need to. I love you. I love you too. How much? A whole lot. Samuel, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. -What is it? -Nothing. Hello? Quick, get out of bed. Here, look. Hide here in the closet, okay? I'll be right back. -Why? -l think someone's in the house. Stay here and keep quiet. Samuel, is that you? Felix. Where are you? Where were you? Didn't you hear me? -l just came in. -Don't stand there, come in. Who is it? Yes, one moment. It's for you. Not this time. You won't get your way this time. Don't be afraid, Julia. Again? Why are you home so soon? We didn't expect you for lunch. It's Friday, Julia. I had a neighborhood meeting. What neighbors? I wasn't aware we knew any. What do you mean? The neighbors. We're going over to see them. Have you been drinking? Yeah, a couple of beers. Let's go see those neighbors. -Where are you going? -Where are the neighbors? Hello! Good afternoon! What fucking neighbors? What are you doing? What's going on? Ask your son. -l have no idea. -Even better. You explain. Me? Luis, what's wrong? What are you doing up? You should be in bed. -l'm scared. -He's scared, like me. You're soaked, Luis. Take it easy. What's going on, Julia? You're scaring the kids. Take your brother to his room. -Come on, Luis. -Leave me alone! Come on! Julia! Calm down, Julia. It's okay. Calm down, it's okay. I tried to tell you, but... You don't listen to me. You always worry. Tell me. It's hard to believe, but... It's been happening since we got here. What has? I see things you don't see. Like presences, trying to communicate. Like they're trying to warn me. What's that? Just sedatives, Julia. They'll relax you. Maybe it's my fault. I ask too much of you and I don't help you enough. But you're not well, Julia. -Don't give me any. -Trust me. -l don't want to sleep. -You know I love you. Then get me out of here. Get us all out of here. You're not yourself. It's this place. Where are these friends of yours? These neighbors that don't exist? They were only cats, Julia. They probably got in through the window. We have to get away from here. All right. It's okay. They want the children. They're taking us over. The ones who open and close the doors. The ones who look and disappear. We'll leave. When? Sleep. What are you doing here? I'm scared. Is she going to die? No, squirt. She'll be all right. -Are you sure? -Of course. Go play with your brother. You're all better now. Felix is with his new friend. He doesn't want to play with me. He only wants to play with his new friend. You should make some new friends too. I've made some. They're very nice. It would help everyone, Luis. I don't like them. They're bad and they scare me. You'll get used to them in time. What about her? She will too, she'll get used to them. You'll get better, right? Remember, monsters can't get out of dreams. You wake up and they're gone. Careful with your bike. Hurry up, we're leaving. What are you doing up? You need to rest. Go to bed. I think I slept too much. Why aren't you at work? Go back to bed, it's early. To bed? Where are the kids going? They're riding bikes with some friends. Luis doesn't know how. He'll be fine. He's with his brother. Leave them alone, Julia. The kids are fine. Try to get some rest. Who are you? I'm Maria. What are you doing here? I've been here all along. Since the beginning. Julia! Julia! Julia! You're not real. You can't hurt me. Julia. JuIia. Hi, we're home. Why are you on your knees? What is this? Well? It's okay, it's only tape. You have to follow the paths. Wait till Dad gets home. Pretend it's a game. You have to follow the paths and keep your eyes on the light. You're pathetic. -How should I go? -Come here, sweetie. Come here. -Stay away from her. -lt's just a game. Jump over, sweetie. Right there. Look at the light. Bitch! Felix, no! Felix, please! Let go of me! Don't listen to her! Bitch! What are you doing to my kids? What should I do, Julia? What the fuck should I do with you? You know something, Samuel. This empty place, that horrible woman, the cats... You're behind it all. No. I'm not behind it. This is all there is. I'm not going to let you ruin our lives. You got that? You'll have to get used to it. No, let go. Hold still! Samuel, open up. Why did you lock it? Samuel? Samuel, open up. Why did you lock it? Luis? Luis, are you there? Go back to bed, Julia. Samuel, open up. I don't want to sleep. Open up right now! Julia, shut the fuck up! Julia. JuIia. No. Don't be afraid, Julia. I won't hurt you. No... Trust me. You'll see. You'll get used to it, you'll see. No... Julia... We're ready, Dad. What are you doing here? Go on, I'll be right down. Luis? Luis? This is the most complicated attack move. And now the full attack. One, two, three! What do you want? Felix, please. Tell me what's happening. Go away. Leave me alone. Where's your brother? -ls he here with you? -Go away! Where is he? Out! I'm over here! Over here! Luis! Luis... I'm scared. Felix hit me. He didn't want to play with me. He's with his new friend. They have real swords. I'm scared. It's okay. There, there. It's okay, sweetie. Why are you crying? Because I fell and hurt myself. But I'm all better now. This isn't a good place, is it? No, it isn't. It's Dad. Yeah. Come here. Run. Run! Stay where you are! Leave the boy out of this. Stay back! Enough of this nonsense. Go away. Leave us alone. Don't you dare touch him. Luis, come here. No. I said come here. I'm not finished with you, Julia. You won't get your way this time. Let him go and go home, or I'll lock you up the whole summer. I won't stand for this. I'll teach you a lesson if you keep this up. Luis, come here! Come to Daddy! Luis! Luis, come here! Go up to my room and hide, quickly! What are you doing? Hide in my room. Go up to my room, sweetie. I'll be right there. Julia! Open the door, Julia! Open the damn door! Luis! Luis! Come here. Come on, sweetie. Give me a hand. Open the door! Luis, don't listen to her! Come with me! -Julia! -We have to jump. We have to jump, sweetie. Really. I'll jump first and you jump after. That's enough! Open up! Come on. That's enough! Open the door! Luis! Luis, come on, jump. Jump, sweetheart. Move up, that's it. That's it. Good, that's it. Jump, sweetie. I'll... Luis! Mommy! Luis, no! Luis! Luis! Luis, sweetie, no! Come here. Come here, Julia. Come here. Come here! Come here! Julia! Shit! Stop! Stop! What have you done with Luis? Felix... Felix! Felix! Help! Help me! Help me, please! Help! Where's Luis? Felix! Felix! Luis... Are you two okay? You're okay. It's all right. Don't worry about the kids. They're shaken up, but they're okay. Thanks, Maria. Thanks for everything. Thanks. Thank you. It's okay. Don't worry, I'm okay. Don't be scared. Don't cry. Don't cry. Mom... Mom...
