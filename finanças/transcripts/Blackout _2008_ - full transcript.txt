With this heat wave, every air-conditioner in the city's running. It's a blackout Well, then, that means the power should be back on soon Well, the one a few years ago lasted almost mo days. Someone died in a fucking elevator. They died? It's not a blackout How do you explain the emergency lights? It's a back-up generator, genius. My hospital has a back-up generator. Banks have back-up generators. Well, what if the elevator's broken? Huh? Wait, wait, wait. How many units have been rented? I think it's, like, half finished. Half finished? There's five Well, there's- okay, this is three. You live with your parents, right? Where are they? I don't know Aruba Okay, Maurie sisters.

Maybe we should sleep in shifts. What's that going to do, kid? If this elevator collapses, it's going to do it whether or not we're keeping guard. Remember, it's going to be daylight soon. And if one of us hears something, like people outside, we should be able to yell. Tommy's right. Of course he's right. He disagreed with me. So you want to go first? I can't take this anymore. What are we going to do? What can I do? Tet's run away. After last night, he'll come back And things are only gonna get worse. You know it That's crazy. What's crazy is staying here with him. We don't have the money for that. No, but my father does. And I know where he keeps it. My father... He always keeps some cash around the house for betting. I found a wad yesterday. Take it He owes you. If he finds out it's missing- No, we'll be at the airport. Tonight? Tonight. We need to think about rationing that water.

And we need one person, one, to make all the decisions We need a strong leader. Now, I'm just strengthening my hand. And don't worry. I'll give you a hit when you need one, if you behave. What kind of a monster are you? Monster? Don't you think you're being a bit dramatic? Maybe I'm just destined for something else. I don't know I'd like to think I'm meant for higher things, though, you know? Higher things. My father always told me, "To endure is to conquer our fate." Fate? Yeah Do you really believe that shit? I like your eyes. Destiny sucks. You'll be fine Yeah, you'll be fine. There's no chance No destiny. No fate There's only what you take from the world and what the world takes from you.

My little girl sees the mess I made upstairs, let me just say, her idea of me as the perfect father is going to be severely tested. 2:30 She's going to be up there at 2:30. And her lips were trembling, and I take this blade, and I cut her up. And it's beautiful. It's fucking beautiful. We were supposed to run away to Paris. Do people still run away? I thought we placated all you kids with cell phones and video games. Shut up, man. No, I'm just kidding around. Paris, it's a great city. The food Some of the women there are even more sexually adventurous than I am, and that's saying something. We're going to have to get something on these cuts. What do you think she's like? What do you mean? Usually the hot ones, they just lay there. You're out of line, man. It's true Bitches are so used to getting there way. And why? Just 'cause they look pretty. Salt Up and down. She seems like she likes this Salt They get all the jobs. They get all the attention But what about the rest of us, Tommy? What about us? Sometimes I wonder why was I born in such a fucked-up era?

I'd say it was definitely terrorists. But how do you think they made it past all the security downstairs? Maybe it was aliens, man. Like in The Twilight Zone, when the electricity goes out, and everybody thinks it was everyone else. But really, it was aliens Well I don't know about that But there's one thing I do know, and that is that if I don't get out of here soon, I'm going to cut your fucking throat... and I'm going to rape the shit out of that cunt What?
