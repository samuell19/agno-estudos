(eerie footstep sound) What a night for sharing stories and you are a very special audience, for I do not tell tales so eagerly and for just anyone. Tales that all have in common the very four walls that you currently occupy with such devout silence. Stories that I hope will stay with you for a very long time. Long after you've departed here. So, shall we begin? However before I start, I must warn you that these are not for the easily disturbed, of the weakened nervous disposition. For these are stories of the macabre! Of lost and maligned spectres, of the monsters that you wish would stay under the bed while you sleep (low thunder rumble) I shall take the continued silence as your consent to proceed (birds chirping) (The Caretaker VO) Once upon a time, they all lived happily ever after That doesn't seem to happen anymore. There are storm clouds gathering in the evening sky. They have the deep purple coloring of a cancerous bruise. And they hang above the landscape. Broody. Waiting. The air is thick with the gathering tension of the nearing cloud burst and I have to fight for every laboured breath. There is a tightening at the back of my neck as the pressure builds. I feel the melancholy mood of the elements and I savor it. It's a perfect night to meet a ghost. I have my share of ghosts from my past, so I suppose it was inevitable that I would become interested in the ghosts that live here. I can still remember the faces so clearly after all these years. We were so young and so foolish as we marched off to do a duty for king and country. We thought we were immortal. We were so very wrong. They called it the war to end war and we believed them. (distant gunfire and explosions) We enlisted and trained and went to the trenches. We died in droves like we'd being harvested. Men lost arms and legs drowned in mud and blood. I saw them torn apart by explosions and bullets, shredded on the wire or worse yet, eaten alive by the gas. When the shells of hot stuff fell, brave men wept and begged for death. Somehow I survived. I lived through two years of hell and the worst I got was a bayonet through the leg. I don't think I was any more worthy of life than my friends who fell. But I had a reason to survive. My Jenny was waiting for me at home and I knew that if I could make it back to her, I could keep the promise I'd made. I had to live, so I did. And I did get home and marry her. I was a changed man though, and even when the war ended and the world celebrated I never truly regained my old self. I had black moods and days of melancholy when even the joy of Jenny's smile failed to reach me. I had so many ghosts. Tonight, perhaps I shall meet another. She's a local legend, her story's been told and retold for the last 200 years. Some say her name was Sarah and some say Sally, but they all call her the Lady in Grey. There are tales of a jilted lover. And others have an estranged husband. But they all mention the betrayal. And the death Sometimes at night I can hear the sound of the rats in the walls. And sometimes I hear distant voices from times long gone. I think about the house and its history. That two of the previous owners ended their days in asylums screaming in mindless insanity. (SCREAMING) Another three committed suicide. (Gun click) (Gun Shot!) Time draws on. I feel every passing second as it marches by. Never to be experienced again. When the Second World War began I tried to re-enlist but I was too old and my injury made me unfit for duty. We struggled through the years as the fighting in Europe continued. The Blitz began and that was how I ended up here. Bray Manor needed a caretaker and I was offered the post. I accepted because I wanted to do my part for my country. Jenny had to stay behind though. Her job in the factory meant that she was too important to the war effort. (Distant Bomb Explosions) (Eerie door creak) (Door Bangings) (Loud Door Bangs!) (Door Bangs Shut!) The house is a vampire soaking up the life force of its occupants like some ancient psychic battery, storing their energies within the cold stonework of its walls. But when that energy is released, innocent people get hurt. (Ghostly Whispers) I received the letter last week. There was an accident at the factory. Three people died. They tell me Jenny didn't suffer. I can only pray that's true. Each day that passes, each moment is like a knife through my heart. I miss her more with every breath that I take and I feel as if a part of my soul the better part of myself is lost. I want to hold Jenny in my arms again. Cradle her face. Breathe in her perfume. My one true love is gone. I long for the day when we can be reunited in heaven. Night spreads its cloak like raven-black wings to shroud the landscape in darkness. The temperature begins to drop. The walls become cold. There are creaks and groans as the house settles amplified by the silence. I feel an icy chill crawl up my spine as if someone has walked over my grave. Far off I hear the faint sound of a child's laughter. It's been 20 years since children last played in these rooms. Stories are living breathing things. They grow and change as time passes. Some die off as their evolution reaches its end. But some survive. Some stories throw off the shackles of the words that bind them. Some will take on a life of their own. Sometimes stories hunger to be told again. The feeling of dread deepens in my bones. My heart quickens, pounding in my chest and then...there's only silence. I don't believe in ghosts. I can only pray that ghosts don't believe in me (Distant Air Raid Sirens) (Distant Aircraft and Bombs) Orange tendrils of fire crawled across the sky heralding the approaching dawn. I feel a weight lift from my shoulders and have breathed more easily. The Lady in Grey never came, but I can feel her presence all around me. It permeates the very fabric of this house like a sweet perfume. It's in the cold hard stone of the walls and the very air that I breathe. There will be other nights when I will wait on my silent vigil. Other opportunities to see her or not. But I know that I will return here again perhaps so we'll see the Lady in Grey. And perhaps if I wait long enough I will be reunited with my Jenny and maybe just maybe I will get my happily ever after (Spoon in Teacup) Enchanting isn't it? Watching all these elements come together to form a liquid so exquisite. It's like casting a spell. Playing with potions, practicing the Dark Arts, the very essence of witchery. And that very subject, brings me to the next tale I wish to share with you. A tale of witchcraft...most foul! (Distant Rumble) (John) Elizabeth? (ELIZABETH!!!) (Inaudible Chanting) (John) Come away from the mirrors darling. (John) Elizabeth. Nathaniel's gone! We can't bring him back! Not like this! (John) We'll find another way!.... Together! These three mirrors are what take your soul, that's what they do! We talked about this! It's too dangerous!!! Take my hand Darling! Please. I won't lose you too....I love you. I HAVE NOT LOST HIM YET! (Low Rumbling...Inaudible Chanting Continues) Darling wake up! Darling Darling wake up! (John Cries) (Unearthly Sound Landscape) They are late sir. I know you must not blame them. We'll be here no longer than we must. But surely we have to show them the property? We will show them what we must. Now go back inside and ensure that the entrance is prepared. Go! Madame Proctor. Thank you how kind. And your gentleman friend...? I can assure you sir, there are no gentleman here! Not by choice anyway. (Lily) Do forgive him. He's just very excited to see the house. (Solicitor) Excited, Yes. I can see he's a gentleman who likes his excitement. I do hope he enjoys the house. It was so generous of Uncle John to leave it to us. (Solicitor) Indeed...Generous. Of course, as I understand it, you were the only one of his extended family who came to visit him. Therefore perhaps less generous and more compelled? But enough of this prattle! I don't have all day! Here are the keys. The front door. The back door. All the other keys are inside. If something is locked and has no key it stays locked. What? Your late uncle's exact words - if it has no key it stays locked! That's ridiculous! It's fine Johnny. It was just Uncle John's way. He was always a bit peculiar about locks...Locks and Mirrors. (Solicitor) Indeed, this house has a bit of a reputation. Even before your uncle bought it years ago people have insisted that this place is well...cursed. Some even say that it's been that way since the day it was built in the... (Solicitor's Assistant) ...12th century sir. Sir...I saw something...somebody...a lady... (Solictor) the 12th century. Which brings me to your uncle's final words. He insisted that I impress upon you with the utmost urgency that you must never be caught between two mirrors. Any part of you...ever! What? His very final words. Now I bid you farewell. (eerie instrumental music intensifies) Jesus! This place could do with a dust! Uncle John was nearly 80 when he died. Companies' been keeping this place clean. A place this size, he must have had staff? Uncle John got rid of them not long after aunt Elizabeth died. Mom said there was so many accidents. The old matron, she dropped a mirror...she couldn't have children after that. He dismissed all the staff after that. Said he didn't want anyone else suffering for his mistakes. I think he just blamed himself for what happened to his family. (Johnny) What did happen? (Lily) They had one child, he died of crib death when he was three months. Aunt Elizabeth died soon after. No one would say what happened to her. I think she killed herself. Uncle John was never the same after that. He even spent a few years in an asylum. Mom said the family rented the house out but as soon as he heard anyone else was living in it, its like he scared himself sane again. Guess this place is cursed after all. (Lily) What is it? (Johny) Nothin, I just thought I saw something. (Lily) There's no one but us in here. Jumping at Shadows. Hey I'm not jumping right. I'm just letting the shadows know who's boss. Someone's got to protect you from this crazy house. Because you're mad old aunt isn't gonna scare us away! Johnny? That you? Stop messing around it's not funny. (eerie door creaking and distant baby cry) (Johnny) Hey! It's me! Nothing to be scared of. That's enough exploring for one day yeah? This book has 'read me' on it. (Lily) Don't you think that's strange? Everything here is strange! It's so weird to finally be here. Thought we'd be at my parents forever! A good weird I know what you mean. That electrician who broke his leg going into the basement. That surveyor who said the place was haunted! "I see dead people!" Don't be mean! You'll be sensitive to the forces of darkness! Where you want this then? What's in it? The word crap springs to mind....some books...a mirror There can't be! Specifically marked things! Don't worry! There's only one in here! Can't believe you're taking the crazy old fool's instructions seriously. Don't talk about Uncle John that way! He wasn't crazy...he's eccentric. Anyway I think since he left us this house at the very least we can do is follow his final wishes. His wish is my command. Let's both bunk off today. We've been working too hard since we got in, I need some me time. (Lily) I need to go out today. And don't forget, Sophia and Abi are coming tonight. That doesn't sound like me time. (Lily) They'll be plenty of Johnny time once I get this job promotion. That's what you said when you got the job! There's always something more important than Johnny time! (Lily) There's nothing more important than Johnny time! Except for today. Yeah, and tomorrow. And the day after next! And the next day! (eerie instrumental music) (Lily) You must be on your best behaviour tonight Johnny. (Johnny) I didn't know we we're making such a fuss for your cousin's. Family's family. (Lily) I want them to feel at home. We didn't speak once and it caused a lot of tension. Wasn't as close to them as we could have been. We even had the same boyfriend. (Johnny) oh yeah! Is there something I should Know? It's just silliness. We were about 10 or 11. We all fancied the same boy next door to Sofia's house. Arthur something. It was just silliness. Anyway he had a big accident when we were still little. No one's heard from him since. I bet! I can't imagine you sharing anybody! (Door Knocks) Thank You Lily for that to fine meal. A little rich perhaps but more than satisfying. (Sophia) Yes Lily delightful (Lily) It was my pleasure. (Sophia) And let's not forget the part the delightful Johnny played. (Johnny) All I did was get the wine. (Sophia) Oh but what wine Johny? What wine? So sorry...I didn't... I don't know how that happened. You're a delight Lily. Well this one's empty. Would anyone like dessert? We only have cake I'm afraid. (Sophia) oh yes that'd be lovely thank you. (Abi) If I must. (Lily) Johnny? (Johnny) Not for me thanks. But I will come give you a hand. (Lily OS) What the hell are you doing? Stop being stupid! Johnny stop being rude right now. NOW JOHNNY! Did Lily tell you how we always shared as children? She err told me you were close. (Sophia) oh yes so close. There's this boy, Arthur Craven, he lived next door to us when we little. Abby and Lily used to come over in the holidays. (Abilgail) Stop it! He doesn't need to know! But I want to tell him. Arthur and I, had an understanding. We'd hold hands on the way to school and I'd always let him catch me. An innocent understanding. When Abi and Lily came over, we would all have fun with him. But as happens when you get a little older, mine and Arthur's relationship became a little more mature. At the age of fourteen we were an official item. I was still so excited when Abi and Lily came to stay. But I tried to keep them apart. I thought they had accepted it. But one day Abby and I were walking through the woods when we heard some noises. Some beastly grunts coming from behind the trees. Abigail) STOP! Sofia You don't have to do this! (Sophia) There was a new fence being built with a mistake on it that wasn't part of the fence I walked around so slowly. So cautiously. My heart was beating so fast I thought it would scare whatever it was away But it didn't. I walked around the trees and found Arthur mounting the perfect Lily...my Arthur and that.... (Lily) That WHAT Sophia!? (Sophia) THAT WHORE Lily! (Abi) That's enough! Both of you! (Lily) Tell them what you did next! Tell them what you did! (Sophia) I wished you were dead! (Lily) But you didn't just wish it did you? (Sophia) I didn't mean to. (Lily) You hit Arthur. (Sophia) I killed Arthur. I loved him! So you slept with her boyfriend? Just like that! This has nothing to do with us! I was 14. I was young and jealous and stupid. Well now I feel jealous and stupid! (Abi) I loved him too. (Abi) Arthur. I loved him too. Neither of you ever thought how it would affect me. (Johnny) There you are. You really shouldn't come up here you know, it's all kinds of creepy I'm sorry you had to hear that Johnny. It's something that's been desperate to get out of me since well since we were children. Hey it's fine it's this place you know it brings out the worst in people. We really should get out of here you know, gives me the shivers. What are you doing? I'm all wet. My dress is wet. You know, it was me playing earlier. Under the table. What? Why are the pretty ones always so dumb? (Johnny) We should get out of here. I really don't like it up here. Oh Johnny, do I scare you? "Read me!?" Johnny! How could you!? Lily! It's not what it looks like - the dress was wet! The dress was wet! Looks like I'm gonna be on the couch tonight. Crazy, we've got this huge house, and only one spare bed! (eerie ghostly voices and echoes) Mirror magic is always dangerous this is compounded when the subject uses the reflection ad infinitum that is to say the subject sits between two mirrors and the mirrors reflect the subject into each other. Each reflection increases the subjects power but at a terrible cost of the subjects soul. Each reflection steals a small portion of the soul and a further terror can occur for the subject if one of them there is is broken during this spell. Because then the soul will not have time to escape and will be trapped for eternity in the last mirror, bound in chains by those in between. Till such a time that they see fit to let you die (Johnny VO) if and God forbid a loved one gets caught between a mirror so possessed and another mirror, the soul will be in terrible danger of being transferred. The only recourse then is to break the mirror before the transfer can take place. Once the soul is caught by the necromancers it is lost. None have the strength to escape their chains. (eerie chanting and ghostly voices intensify) (Lily - confused) It's my life! It's my life! What about my life? I want my baby With John (Lily as Elizabeth!) I want my child! Nathaniel! (Lily) My life! (Johnny) Lily! Is that you! Lily! (Lily) My John. Johnny? I was so scared! I guess I'm forgiven for earlier then? (Lily) I was so scared, I thought I'd be in that mirror forever! Come back to bed then! Of course, how could I let my hero sleep anywhere else. Good morning Lily. I hope you can forget about last night. Sophia's still a little high-strung, but I know she wants to get over everything. Well she's sorry and I hope you can forgive her like she tried to forgive you. Least you're getting rid of those abominations. Uncle John would be grateful. (Lily) Yes, the mirrors have to go. John would have wanted it before now. I hope you found you stay here not too unpleasant. I found this place can make people feel like that. But thank you. (Abi) For What? (Lily) For bringing me...us back to life so to speak. We needed new surroundings. New beginnings, you could say. Do keep in touch (To herself) Not long now Nathanial. Not long now. (Johnny mumbles)...oh go back to sleep Johnny. Go back to sleep til you are needed. (eerie music begins) (Lily's haunting screams echo!) Amazing, how the wax burns and melts. It's lifeforce ebbing away slowly. Even the small flames flicker around, determined to survive until the very last moment. Keeping back the darkness that will inevitably take hold. And what about the monsters that dwell in the darkness? Some have had centuries to perfect their schemes and the chances are you've seen them. Oh you may think it is a trick of the light, a play on the mind. But no no no I can assure you you have. Sometimes pretending to be asleep might be what ultimately saves you. Because you never know, what might be staring back at you! Hiding in the darkness plotting your demise. And should you ever stumble across one of those unmentionables who thrive in the blackness, may you pray that you come out of it alive and still of this world! (distant church bells) (Malone) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to give you such a fright my friend. (Thomas) No, no it's it's okay I I just didn't think anyone was around. To be honest I haven't seen anyone for miles really, so I'm quite thankful to see you. (Malone) Well allow me to introduce myself, I'm father Malone. (Thomas) Thomas. Thomas Burlington. Thank you (Malone) I see you were looking for some information. Our service times perhaps? (Thomas) Yes, I was just wondering what time service will be in the morning. (Malone) Well the good Lords work never ends but in this instance I start at early sunrise. Seven o'clock. (Thomas) Well I'd like to take you up on that. And join your sermon if you would permit me? (Malone) I would very much like to welcome it. Shall we walk? I see you have a keen eye Master Burlington. I'm afraid its from a dark chapter in our small village. Regrettably also very recent occurrence which has tainted the good folk of these parts. (Thomas) I'm sorry Father, I didn't mean to... (Malone) Unfortunately the devil himself had a desire to seek out innocence throughout my humble flock. I take it you also notice the dates inscribed on our buried here. My goodness...these poor souls died barely a year ago. Yes, it was last winter. November time we lost the first. They became regular. Our community was torn apart with grief. We started sending out search parties into the woods. Never giving up! Even after dark, we continued...but to no avail. One of our search parties went missing too. We never saw the men from it again. Some 20 of them vanished, with no trace. But the killing stopped and I prayed that they managed to stop the fiend. Even though it had cost them dearly in life. Some said the devil came back to reclaim the good earth. And for some terrifying weeks last year he rode again. Spreading his evil wings across these fair lands. What you see here are mere markers for those dearest we lost. It was the least we could do to try and provide somewhere for their families to remember them. (Thomas) I'm sorry Father. Shall we continue? I dare say that heavens above are not on our side today. with those clouds. May I ask where you staying and the nature of your visit? (Thomas) I'm staying at the large estate. I'm sure you'll know it, the old house up the lane. Yes, it's a client who owns it. He continuously encourages us to use it for trips if you wish. (Malone) I see. It's been some years since I've seen or indeed heard of anyone taking up residence there. (Thomas) Yes, well the city's been somewhat unkind of late and I thought I'd take out some time to catch up on some arrangements and duties. But with some solitude. Return to the countryside for a time. (Malone) Please take care. I can only imagine what the place must be like after all the years empty. And should you seek company, then remember my door will always be open to receive you. (Thomas) Thank you Father. I will perhaps take you up on that. I think for tonight though, I will unpack and maybe take some supper at the inn. Then just retire to bed. (Malone) Thomas I....(pause) I have my duties to attend to. I shall bid you farewell and look forward to seeing you on the morrow. Good morning to Mr. Burlington. (Thomas) Good morning to you too Father. (eerie music intensifies) May as well try and get some work done then. (Crickets) (Footsteps and nails across gate) Curses! (Villagers low chatting) (Innekeeper) Good evening Sir. May I take your coat? (Thomas) Could I trouble you for a brandy? (Innkeeper) Of course sir. Cynthia, bring the gentleman a brandy. May I ask...what brings you to these parts Sir? I'm staying at the old house, catching up on some work affairs. May I trouble you for a meal, I'm afraid I fell asleep earlier and I was fearing you'd have closed the kitchen by now. (Innkeeper) I'm afraid our cook has left for the evening sir. But I can ask Cynthia here to rustle you up some warm soup. There is still some bread left and it is still quite fresh. (Thomas) That would be most appreciated yes, thank you. I feel I must express my sympathies for the recent troubles you had in these parts. (SILENCE) I'm sorry I didn't mean to... (Local Man) You didn't mean to pry more like! We don't need no more strangers around these parts! (Thomas) I'm staying here for a few weeks. Working on up at the house. I'm afraid my rash tongue has got the better of me. And I apologize if I caused upset. It was not my intent. Yet you have upset!! My wife, my wife stays awake at night praying to the Almighty that our son returns. Our son! That he's not lost in the evil that roams around these parts. And Merrin! He lost his daughter didn't you Merrin? (Merrin) She was the love of my life. (Local Man) Oh, we found her... bloodied...ripped in two. (Thomas) I'm sorry but Father Malone implied this was an isolated incident, from last year? (Local Man) Father Malone is a man of God! He has to give us hope you bloody fool! But we know the difference don't we? (Locals) Yeah (Local Man) And secretly, so does he. (Thomas) I'm not sure I understand? (Local Man) Whatever brought this evil to these here parts is still in the air. (Local Man 2) But he won't get away from us so easily next time though! (Local Man) No! No he won't! Because when he comes crawling out the woods, we'll get him. (Thomas) But what are you all afraid of? Locals talk The Clawed Man. I'm sorry I must disagree. I beg you to consider what you remark next my friend. You must not easily dismiss the claims of these good folk. There are forces present that we are yet to understand. Forces that have already infected these parts with a diabolical evil. If there is one thing I must insist, I beg of you, beware the woods. Thank you for your counsel my friend. But I must press on to you all now that what happened was not the work of any ghost, ghoul or goblin, but merely the unfortunate consequence of a deranged individual, who I'm saddened to say took their macabre and sickened fantasies out on the most innocent of us here. And for that, you have my deepest sympathies. But to claim that any manifestation of the supernatural, had any parts to play in these events, I simply cannot conceive. (Local Man) I suggest you leave this place hastily. (Innkeeper) Can't the man eat his supper beforehand? He has made his begotten feelings known! (Thomas) No, it is fine. I've said my piece and now I will leave. (Innkeeper) You asked for a meal Sir, and it is my duty to provide you with one. As my service dictates, so please take this with you back to the house. Thank you. I will return it tomorrow. Good Night. (eerie music) (outside noises and footsteps) No wait please! (Heavy Panting) (distant water drips and running trickles of water) (sudden noise) Hello? Is someone there? I assure you, I mean no harm. (low rumbling voice) Why do you disturb my dwelling? I saw you. Up at the house. The House? The house through the wooded area. I'm staying there for a while. I saw you the other night. What did you see? Nothing obscene. I just wanted to help and when I saw you just now again...I followed you. I'm afraid you bore a wasted journey. Please leave me in peace, and alert no one of this place. I'm sorry. I just wanted to extend the hand of kindness for a fellow man. I'm afraid I've been traveling for some time now to get here, and... well the villagers aren't the most welcoming of people. So upon seeing you I... You travel? Yes, from coastlines to York and presently from London. London? Here. I have some bits of assorted foods. I thought you may be hungry. (snatches them) My traveller. Please forgive my unwelcoming manner. I've been alone for a very long time. You're most welcome. (Vampyre) I used to travel a long time ago. I would sail seas. Visit vast lands. I went to the countries of New York. Fine destinations my friend. May I ask, how you came to end up in your present accommodation? Unfortunately my appearance clouds the thoughts of many. I came to these fine lands to tempt my exquisite tastes. But I was seen as a monster. A figure who would terrorize the countryside & the cities of this fair land. I'm sorry I don't follow. I was accused of hurting...even killing some of the villagers. I did not. So I was chased and I found this place and found solace here. And I've been here ever since. So they thought you were the culprit committing the murders last year and were chased out. That's why you ended up here? They did. And know, I survive on the scraps of food I can find. (Thomas) Please. You must come with me. I can take you up to the house, you can stay there. It's warm and you can have your own room. I stay here. I must rest. (Thomas) But I insist! (Vampyre) I MUST rest. (Thomas) Okay, but I will return each day with food and drink to help. But please know you're always welcome at the house. My salvation...has arrived. (crickets chirping) (hissing) (supernatural grown) (dramatic music intensifies) (Villager 1) I told you should have stopped working earlier. The animals will be fine for tonight. It's us I'm more worried about. (Villager 2) You fear too much. Too much blasted superstition around these parts. (Villager 1) But the talk! The rumours continue in this night time. It hides evil still! I swear it! (Villager 2) There hasn't been an incident since last winter. Whatever it was vanished from these parts a long time ago. (Villager 1) I wish I had your faith. (Villager 2) Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause us to stay over. You should have been home a long time ago, to be with your family. (Villager 1) It's just these woods! I tell you there's still a great evil here! It has lingered! Please, can we just go! (Villager 2) Wait! I must... (signals to woods) (Villager 2) I'll be back. (Villager 1) Please....hurry! Music Intensifies! (Hissing! Neck Snaps) You but took your time didn't you? (Silence) Do you not hear me? Michael!? (Music intensifies) (Flesh rips) (Bats swarming) (Innkeeper in distance!) MONSTER! (Malone) Please I beg of you, let me throu... That Monster! (Innkeeper) He Killed my Cynthia! Thomas! Where are you going!? COME BACK! Thank goodness you're safe! I was fearful! (Vampyre) Is something wrong my traveler? (Thomas) Listen, you've got to get you away from here. Somewhere safe. The villagers...they came ready to stage a hunt! And if you or anyone out the ordinary could be... (Vampyre) Let. Them. Come. What? But if they come... (Vampyre) I will tear them apart. I will rip them limb from limb. I will tear their throats apart and then... ...I will do the same to their sons and daughters! You had me at somewhat of a disadvantage. For a year I have been living off the scraps of this barren land. Hiding in the shadows like a vermin! After they ambushed me and left me in a prolonged state of weakness. Hibernation, if you will. I thought I would never see the beauty of dripping blood ever again. (Thomas) But I don't understand! (Vampyre) I have wanted to escape from this place for so very long. I've wanted to return to the cities and feast...but the woods have eyes everywhere. I would not wander far without being seen by man. My demise will be assured. But then you come my traveller! Someone to be my distraction! So that I may leave unnoticed and without suspicion. Do you now only see your part...your role in my escape. I've observed and chosen you to take my form. To take my place! To them...you...shall...be...me! Come! To the final moment. To the last stage of your transformation! Come towards me traveller and allow me to help you on your journey... in my image! (Thomas) NO! You monster! You used me! (Vampyre) Come now. Allow me to repay your kindness and repay you with DAMNATION! (Eerie music intensifies!) (punch!) (Malone) You are my flock. And this time I shall not let you go alone! Terror stalks these lands again. But tonight, we will end it forever. But we must first go to the house. We must get Thomas. No one should be left behind! Please! You cannot enter here! Don't you remember our first encounter. You welcomed me in...at any time! (Merrin prays - Indistinct chatter amogst Villagers) (Intense music continues) (Nails stratch surface) HISSING (fighting sounds) (Thomas gasps for air!) (Teeth bite into neck) (Innkeeper) What was that? (Lady) It sounds like the devil himself! (Malone) Thomas is in there, with whatever that was! Here! We found him! Look at the blood! It's him! He's the monster after all! The fiend! Let's take him before the others! Let them decide what to do! (Villager) Lord have mercy! The fiend! It is him! Our killer! (Malone) No! It cannot be! There must be some kind of mis... (Vilager) Step aside Father! We must act upon our discovery. Look at the evidence before your eyes. This is the creature that has caused us so much pain and terror to us. (Innkeeper) He must have been using the house to avoid detection from us! To blend in! (Malone) It cannot be! (Villager) What a twist of fate that it is here we find him...changing into his demonic form! Getting ready to go out to kill any one of us at any point. We must act quickly. The Sun will be rising soon! (Thomas coughs) Please...help me! Down there... in the cellar... you must stop it...the vampyre Keep your unholy tongue to yourself! He killed my Cynthia! (Villagers Chanting) Kill Him! Kill Him! No... you must... it's in there... please. You must stop him! Father please help! (Malone) You cannot do this! I beg of you all to think about what you're about to do! Please think about what you're doing! This doesn't make sense! He is the Vampyre Father. He killed our loved ones last year and now he's back to finish the job! He even taunted us with his presence...in our village! My Inn! As if to gloat and to look upon the torture he has caused us! (Villager) Rot in hell! You Fiend! Noooo! (Malone) May God have mercy on you Thomas. The Lord works in mysterious ways Father. As you have so proclaimed many times. That filth shall walk the earth no more. (Innkeeper) Are you all right Father? I know that this is not the fairest of sites for anyone, but... (Malone) He Saw it! The figure....the real villain! (Villager) Father... we all saw the marks on his neck. (Innkeeper) That's right Father. It was him. He was here and the murders started yes? And it was him who contributed to our losses last autumn! Without us seeing him. That much is evident. Now we must show...warn anyone who dare oppose the good Lords work shall not succeed! (Malone) I do not except that! And I never will. And because I didn't speak out... ...a young man has lost his life tragically. While the real villain is still out here somewhere! One thing I will say we agree on my fellow men... the good Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways. Good morning to you sir. (Vampyre) Good morning. I was on my way through the countryside to pastures new. When I saw this...well suffice to say there's nothing normal sight to see in a calm countryside in these lands. May I ask his crime? This man had been tampering with evil. At its most extreme. Dabbling with the occult. Vampirism! (Vampyre) Vampirism! My... goodness. What did this fiend commit on your people? (Villager) Oh Murder! Death! (Vampyre) Then I pass all my sympathies...heinous crimes. (Villager) No, no, no...not to worry now we caught the fiend! Satan's Claw's himself have been cut off. Through this vile creatures demise. And all through the good people at this ere' village. (Innkeeper) May you drink with us sir and help us celebrate our good Lord's work? and triumph on this day. (Vampyre) Your gesture is kind. But I must push on South if I'm to make it to my destination. I simply saw this macabre vision and was sidetracked by curiosity. (Villager) Again my humblest apologies on any distress he may have caused you. (Vampyre) But for naught. It seems that you have caught an evil man...creature even. (Vampyre) And done the good Lord's work which is to be praised and demonstrated that wickedness can still thrive in this barren world. I know I'm in somewhat of a hurry but may I stand here a while and pray thanks that this slice of wickedness has been stopped? (Innkeeper) We wish you the very best for your travels sir and we hope that you reach your destination safely. and with a little discomfort. Good morning to you sir. (neck cracks) My dear traveler. I am forever in your debt. You have freed me and allowed me to leave this wretched place. And its mysterious ways. With new life I move on with new goals and tastes. Oh and don't worry, I shan't let you down. For every victim I tear apart, for every person I tear limb from limb, remember this...their blood will be on your ratched name. Adieu Thomas! And don't worry. I will keep ripping them until I do...get buckled! (eerie music plays) (low thunder) I do enjoy this painting. It's one of my favorites here. And this one, always catches my eyes too. It encompasses perfectly the occult. The dark arts. What a fascinating yet deadly experience for the human mind. So eager to understand, to comprehend you're unable to deal with the consequences of meddling with such evil things! (Thunder and lightning!) (eerie music) (Martine Screams!) (Doreen) Samuel! (Sam) Aunty Doreen! (Doreen) I was beginning to think you weren't coming. I thought maybe you died in a horrible accident on the way. So what do you think of the place? (Sam) It's very impressive. (Doreen) The place was a steel! You know me never one to miss a good business opportunity. (Sam) You did well. (Doreen) So how's your father? Still shacked up with that hussy!? (Worker) Well that's everything. If you could just sign here. (Worker) Is she always in such a good mood? (eerie music plays) Morning (Martine) Good day so far? It's been non-stop! Found another mess in the Gent's toilets again. Dirty little beggars! I'm gonna stop following them in there if this carries on. (Martine) How's things with Bill? Yeah good. Just wish he'd take me out every now and again. Every once in a while. Wish he'd just get off his fat lazy idle ass. No, but seriously, just wish he'd take me out to a fancy restaurant or something. (Martine) Have you tried just asking? Yeah, but his idea of a night out is at the social. Found this really nice place. (Martine) Oh yeah, where is it? It's at Hobbs Lane. The old manor house. Opens next week (Doreen) All of these old stuff came with the house. It's mainly junk but I think it adds character don't you. (Sam) Yeah (Doreen) Now the front of the house will serve as the restaurant. Upstairs are the living quarters. I have a room prepared for you. (Doreen) Did you have anything you wanted to ask? (Sam) Er, yeah...I just... Ahh Heidi! Sam, this is Heidi, our head chef. Heidi, this is Sam. He's going to be working as a waiter. (Sam) Wait! I thought you said I'd be helping you run the place? I didn't think I'd be waiting tables. (Doreen) Oh you think you're too good to wait on tables? (Sam) No it's just that I thought you said.... (Doreen) I said I have a job here. I'm also giving you free accommodation. I thought you would have appreciated what I'm doing for you after everything. This is a fresh start for you to build your life back up again. You can't always start at the top, sometimes you have to work your way up. If it makes you happy you can be head waiter. Gee thanks. (Doreen) Now it's time I got back to work. If you don't mind...how about giving the front path a sweep. Those dreadful workers left a terrible mess...sends out the wrong impression don't you think? Whatever you say. "Sends out the wrong impression don't you think?" Vile old bat! (Martine) Excuse me. (Sam) Shit! You scared me. Sorry, can I help you? Well, I heard there might be some jobs going so thought I'd stop by and Yeah, I don't really deal with that sort of thing. My aunt does. But I could pass on your details. (Martine) Okay. (Sam) So you've done this kind of thing before? Yeah, I currently work at a bar not far from here. (Sam) And you don't like it there? It's fine for now. I just errm.. (Sam) What? (Martine) Can I be honest? (Sam) Yeah (Martine) I heard that somebody had bought this place and I had to just come here and.... (Sam)And...? (Martine) And my break's nearly over. around and they're my brakes nearly over I should head back to work. It was nice meeting you. (eerie instrumental music) (eerie whispers) (Frederick) Martine? You must go back to the house! This can't be real! You must not let the innocent suffer! The way I have suffered. (classical music plays in the background) (Door closes in distance) (Broom Stick falls over) (Doreen) What are you doing down here? (Sam) I heard a noise so I thought I'd come to see... (Doreen) Are you idiot! It was me! (Sam) What are you doing up, it's late? Never you mind! Go back to bed! (classical music continues) (eerie music mixes with classical) Ah! There you are! You think you're funny you little shit! Trying to scare an old lady like me (She screams) Please! Don't take me! No! Screaming! Don't kill me! (Martine) I'm not going to kill you! (Sam) Who are you? What do you want? (Martine) What did you see!? My aunt! She's dead! Something killed her and then it came after me! (Martine) Come on we have to go! (Sam) Who are you!? Why are you here? (Martine) Come on we have to go! (Sam) I think I'm getting crazy! (Martine) No, you're not crazy. (Sam) Ok, will you please tell me what's going on? They call it the diabolique. It's a force of darkness that manifests itself in many forms. It's an ancient and powerful evil that feeds on the negative energy of this house and those who reside within. It also feeds on the souls of its victims. (Sam) How do you know all of this? Who are you? (Martine) My name is Martine St. Clemente. When I lived in this house it killed my only family. My brother, Frederick. (Sam) I'm so sorry. It will not let us leave this house. (Sam) What do we do? (Martine) There is a chance. I found this book when I lived here. It talks about demons and dark forces. It contains ancient incantations which summon the dark lords as well as banishing them. We can use this to send that parasite back to whatever hell it came from. (Sam) But what do we do just read a passage or something? (Martine) It isn't quite that simple. First we must face the demon. (Sam) What if that doesn't work? (Martine) We have no other choice. Do you think it's here? (eerie demonic noises) It's here. (Sam) Oh Christ! (Martine) Come on, we need to be going. (eerie sounds everywhere...intensifying) (supernatural howls intensify) (door banging!) (thunder) (ghostly child laughter) (evil sounds) READ IT! Read the incantation now! (Martine recites spell) (spell reading continues and the sounds stop) (electric humming) (toys start to play) (eerie music intensifies) (low demonic rumble) (Martin) What! I banished you! (Frederick) That book you hold in your hand is not your ally. It serves only the forces of darkness! (Martine) But Frederick... (Frederick) Sorry sis...it was me all along. I offered myself as a sacrifice so my master could enter this world. I gave him the doorway. But he needed you to open it! (Sam) You bastard! (Frederick) Offer yourself to my master. Come serve him as I have and the fruits of this world will be at our disposal! Go to hell!!! Very well. Then we will take you as our slaves! (dramatic wind, rumbling, house shaking begins and intensifies) (Frederick emits a sinister and ever deafening laugh) Thunder and Lightning! The morning hour approaches. The chimes of midnight have passed. I would like to express what a wonderful audience you have all been. But the time for stories is over for now (eerie music begins to grow) I must admit I was surprised that we were all able to gather here this past night. But I'm so glad I've had an opportunity to share these stories with you for they are now your stories. For you are as much a part of them as they are of you. I confess I do love telling a good scary story. Creating a world of the living breathing characters within. Perhaps drawing a modicum of inspiration from the classics... ...for each of your deaths. (Thunder!) But not that you should be downhearted about such trivial things. Because I actually think this place has helped me produce my best work yet. Oh no! This house with its tales of ghouls and ghosts... ...you could say they inspired me no end! They made my work more creative and your deaths more memorable. I do have a reputation to uphold. A public image. After all, what does an Architect do but plan. Now, whose death shall I plan for next...yours perhaps? (dramatic music begins)
