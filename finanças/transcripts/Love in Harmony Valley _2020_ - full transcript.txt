Yes, I'm that close. I'm just about to turn onto Main Street. Excellent. Now you know dinner isn't going to be fancy. But I bottled my tomato sauce last week and I want to show it off.

Now, you haven't had any communication with Tracey since before the accident. Are you sure you're okay seeing her today? I'm not sure if I am ready. But I know that I need to see her. Tracey's been your best friend since first grade. Of course you need to see her. We used to talk every day. More than once a day. It's been three months. And I still don't know what to say. Well, Emma, you two have shared the same brain since you ate paste together. You'll find a way to work through this together, too. If only life was as simple as papier-mâché. Oh, I miss those days. I bet Tracey misses it more. She loved making a mess. Yes, that she did. Do you remember when you wrote those thank you notes to the Tooth Fairy? Yes. And you started that babysitting business together. Uh huh. Do you still have those matching charm bracelets? Yeah. I just need to walk through that hospital door and say something. Or life is never going to get better. Well, the sooner you start, the better you'll feel. Thanks, Gran. Push. All the way up. All the way. All the way. Perfect. You're doing great, Tracey. Thanks. Do you want to try a different exercise? Um. Yeah. I just need a minute. [Nurse Frances] No. I'm sorry. Only immediate family members are permitted to visit. I'm her best friend. We're practically family. The rules are the rules. I just need to see her. Contact Tracey's family. They may or may not approve your request. She only has a brother. And... I don't know how to reach him. Excuse me. I came here to see Tracey. I'm not leaving until I do. Look, uh... I can't break the rules for you. Only the family can give permission. And until then, you need to go home. It's already been too long. I can't. Will! Hey! I came to see Tracey. But they won't... Just leave, Emma. No. I need to see... You need what? Tracey needed you to not get her almost killed in a car accident. She was in the ICU for thirteen days. She's had three surgeries so far. We weren't even sure she's going to walk again. And you ran back to the city as fast as you could. Just go home, Emma. [gulps for air] [gulping for air] [hears car brakes squealing, smashing sounds] [hears sirens wailing] [breathes normally] [electronic beeps] Keep your hips square. [Tracey, out of breathe] Okay. You look... amazing. I was watching. You're doing great. Thanks. I'm getting better every day. At least that's what they tell me. I didn't even know if you'd be able to... I just didn't know. New shoes? They're nice. I got them online shopping. Do they fit okay? You know, sometimes when you buy stuff online, and it just doesn't work and... I should have been here for you, Tracey. I'm so sorry. I missed you so much, Emma. I missed you too. [lets out a big breath] Really, Emma? Hey, have you seen my biceps? I could beat Earl Ivey at this year's arm wrestling competition at the Fall Festival. I'm pretty sure that even I could beat Earl Ivey. Is your doctor going to let you go? She knows it's one of my goals. Will doesn't think I'll be able to, but, whatever. He's my brother and I love him. But he's very smothery. I think he's just looking after you the best way he knows how. Yeah. By smothering! Wait. Has he moved back here from San Francisco? Yeah. He dropped everything just to take care of me. I should really be nicer to him. I guess I really should have been here for both of you. I'm glad Will was. I'm sorry he's being so awful to you. I get it. I know he blames me for the accident. I don't blame him. Everyone knows that truck came out of nowhere. There's nothing you could have done. Hey, I see you came bearing gifts. You are pushy, you know that? Cough it up! Okay. You can open this one. Emma! I love them. Get my bracelet from the drawer! They're beautiful. Does this say 'twenty'? We passed that birthday a long time ago. Yes, but twenty years ago this fall, you and I started first grade together. We've been friends for twenty years? You're making me feel old, Em. Here. It will look much better without this stunning hospital bracelet. Off soon. And the shooting star is for good luck. Some people think a big, positive change is coming. I just, I want good things for you. I want good things for you, too. I'm really sorry I wasn't here. After the accident you were hurt so badly, and I walked away with just a few scrapes. Emma. Stop. You were hurt too. I can see it in everything about you. You need to stop blaming yourself. Everyone knows it wasn't your fault. Even the police know that. Plus, I'm still here. I'm alive! Trust me, there's a reason for that. -Here. -No. I got it. And, I know what I'm getting you for Christmas already. Hint. It jingles. So Will must miss being Mr Successful in San Francisco. He's working on a new project. Something different. Tech's only a part of it. And he's sitting on a bunch of boards. Wow. Who would of thought that he would be a tech genius? Some nerds have all the luck. He's really not a nerd. Yeah, he is. No. Here. The rest of your presents. Ah! Ooh! Lady in pink! Don't mind if I do. Whoah! You shouldn't be texting and walking Will. That's a funny joke, coming from you. I wasn't on my phone. Okay. I was not distracted. And I definitely was not drinking. Sure. I know that you blame me for the accident. And I'm sure you'd rather I not be here right now. And yes, you're right. I was not here in the aftermath. But I am now and I want to do everything I can to help my best friend. Tracey can make her own decisions about that. But for me, it's just a little too late. We're as close as sisters, Will. You know that. You're right. And I do respect how close you two are. I should not have lost my temper. I understand why you did, though. If Tracey and I hadn't come back for the jamboree, and I hadn't been driving us home on Route 8, and... She would still be living her normal life. You abandoned her. And you walked away without a scratch. I didn't, though. It's not the same, but... You know what? I don't want to talk about this. Okay? The food's getting cold. Can we talk later? [electronic beeping, door closes] That was delicious. Funny how it's the little things that frustrates me the most. Like not being able to get your own burger. I'll walk if you need to stop passing nurses as long as you need. Emma's bringing contraband barbecue tomorrow. Why the scowl? You want in on some brisket? No. You know exactly why. I just don't understand how you can welcome her back with open arms. You keep thinking I'm the only one who got hurt in the accident. I know why she didn't come back. She was blaming herself and she didn't want to face me. And it's tearing her up inside. I'm happy she's back. I think it means we can finally heal mutually. And I'm hoping my older brother can understand that and be a part of it too. Be nice to her. For my sake. You know what else would help? Get me out of here. Get me home. Yeah, well. Maybe just not yet. Your doctor said you'd be better here for a while. Right? I want to sleep in my own bed and take an actual shower. Well, look. I'm just concerned about what might happen to you at home. What if something happens and I'm not there? Homecare is personally covered by insurance. Plus I'm going to be here every single day doing physio. Okay. So how's the project? Yeah, it's going pretty good. Is that all you got? Flynn and I, we're putting together a little proposal to reopen the old winery. Plus a little tourism app for Harmony Valley. Are you serious? That's the best news of the decade! Emma and I used to love working there, in our first year of college. I know you love it. That's one of the reasons we want to do it. And it will give Harmony Valley a little boost, too. So what do you have to do next? Well, I got to get the town council's approval. And to do that, I got to get on the docket and get buy-in from the one person who holds sway over it all. Who is... [both together] Rose. Don't you think if you want something from Emma's grandma, the first logical step would be, be nicer to Emma? Maybe. Yeah. But this proposal, it just makes good business sense. Like if the winery is open again, it'll provide new jobs, bring in more tourists, give the town enough money to update some sorely out of touch utilities. Okay, well, let's say I'm Rose. How does being a software developer make you a winery expert? It's more that it has made me a financier. I know a good investment when I see it. And this town needs a good investment strategy. Jobs are sorely needed. I mean, Flynn and I, we've been working on the winery, turns out I'm pretty good at it. And when you're better, you'll going to need a job. Let's not kid ourselves. I'm getting the best job. When you're better. Which we both know is soon. Actually, yeah. I think it will be soon. Hey Gran! Oh. How did it go? It couldn't have gone better. We were the friends we always were. It was so nice to see her. I'm going to go back tomorrow. Well, this calls for a celebratory dance. Come on. Oh Gran. Hey. No. I hate that this accident has stolen all your sparkle. I really wish that I could just snap my fingers and be over it. It's like Tracey. I love how she just lives in the moment. But, Will. I don't think Will can get past it either. I see. I think you're worried about him. He's behaving badly and you still care for him, just like when you were young. But you know what? I always thought he had feelings for you. If that were the case, it's definitely over now. Ms Rose? Nice to see you again. Long time. Gran, you remember Will? It's been a long time, young man. How's Tracey doing? Ah, she's doing great. Better day by day. Good. Good. And are you here to apologize to my granddaughter for blaming her? [Emma] Gran. I know it's difficult sometimes, but an accident is just an accident. Well, my Gran's always been know for speaking her mind. And although I doubt that's what Will is here for, I think him and I will work it out between us. Yeah, I guess we will. For Tracey's sake. It was nice to see you, Will. Excuse me. See you. You know Will? Life's too short to hold onto bad feelings. You three were such good friends growing up. When you get to be my age, you're going to want lifelong friends who stick together, and have each others' back. Rose, I was actually hoping to talk to you about my Harmony Valley Vineyard project. I hear you're convening the Council next week, and I was hoping you could put it on the docket. I have a little information here just to help you understand our intentions on it. [birds chirping]Do you hear that? It touches my heart. I'm just trying to help this town see that progress is like a night out with friends. Everyone comes home happy. Here's a little background information for you. I might be more open to your project, if you and Emma were on better terms. I need to see that you mean well, that you care about people. Okay. I completely understand that. You know what? I will talk with Emma and I just respectfully ask you to consider putting that on the docket. Can you do that for me? I'll see you at the meeting. Thanks Rose. Appreciate that. Thank you. [sobbing, breathing heavily] [gasping for breath] [indistinct voices in her head] Breathe, breathe. Two, three... [Will] Hey, how's it going? -Well? -Well what? Did you get the votes? No, it's a bit early for actual votes. But she said we can give our presentation at the next meeting. So. Emma was there. -Really? -Yup. How did that go? It was about as awkward and uncomfortable as I've ever been, I think. Hey, look man, don't get mad when I say this. But maybe it's time to let that night go. Wow. Thanks for siding with Tracey, man. I just keep seeing Emma driving, getting distracted, texting, she's blaring the radio, off in dreamland. Something stupid and careless. And then my mind just drifts to Tracey in intensive care with all these tubes sticking out everywhere. It doesn't make any difference. It's time to forgive her. She's not a monster. Yeah. You know what? If she hadn't gone away for months, if she'd even bothered to call, maybe it'd be easier for me. You know her. She must've had a good reason. There is no good reason for that. Will! All right. Tracey forgave Emma. I know I have to try to do the same. I know. I know. Regardless, as part of her consideration for our project, Rose said I have to get along better with Emma. Yeah, so, I reached out. Emma's going to bring Tracey over on a day pass. It'll help relieve Tracey's hospital boredom. So. Good start. I know it's not final or anything, but if all goes well in the meeting, seems appropriately optimistic to hang out our shingle. Yeah? You got everything ready to make the sign? 'Welcome to Harmony Valley Vineyard'. That's what you're thinking, right? Exactly. It's just too bad that the vineyard doesn't start till the end of the side road. -Nice try. -No. Seriously. You're in the wrong place. Okay. Umm. Okay. Good to know. Umm... See... It's confusing out here. Hey. We need a sign. Oh, hold off, hold off. I've got her. [Emma] No, we got it. It's okay. -Here. -Thank you. -You be careful. -I know. I'm going to get in trouble. Will, I got it. She's doing really great, huh? Yeah. She's better every day. Yeah. Thank you for letting me to bring her out here. It's just nice to see her excited about something again. Tracey's the reason that you want to reopen the winery, isn't she? Yeah. Yeah. She used to love working with our dad when he was the manager. She'd talk my ear off about what this place could be. Yeah. I just hope it helps get her back up on her feet. You know. Hey! What do you think? It's beautiful. I love being out here again. We're not just reopening the winery. We're going to make it a place to celebrate. Weddings here, and the parties there. And I am going to plan every single one of them. My events in the city were legendary. They really were. She did this one party where there was a rooftop pool. It was incredible. So your hospitality degree, it's just a degree in fun, right? [laughs] Yeah. Well, then this town needs you. Emma. You can design the interiors. Like we dreamed in college! Well. We just going to need to get Council to help us get this place up and running first. Well, I can put together some thoughts for special events for your meeting. And Emma, you could do a mood board, like fabric swatches, tiles, colors... I would love to. If that's okay with Will? Yeah. There's no objections here. Might as well do the logo while you're at it. Like how you did in those indie coffee shops, in that shopping mall you did out in the west end. You saw those? Well. I actually like your designs. Tracey's always showing me your work. Wow. I'm sorry. You were probably humoring her when you see them. No, I actually like seeing what you're up to. Okay. Who wants to see some grapes. [Tracey] Me! This is all... Cabernet? [indistinct chattering] Em, can I come in? Yeah, of course. I hope I'm not interrupting? Well, I'm just trying to... Oh. Well now, I know designing's changed a little since my time, but don't they usually have a lot more samples going on? I'm a little muddled these days. What do you think? Retro but chic? Well, the right retro is always chic. I came back here for just a visit. But do you think I should stay? For Tracey? If I'm being honest, I want you to stay for Tracey and for me. Even I get lonely sometimes you know. But do you want to stay for you? It doesn't really matter. I can work from anywhere. I just need my computer and a phone so I can talk with my clients. You know, the winery would be so good for Tracey. And I could be a part of that. I really love the energy of the city. I do, but... I don't know. I'm confused. Sweetheart, you have to mend your past before you can move towards your future. Are you saying that I should be honest with Tracey? And with Will. Tell them both why you were away. Tell them what happened. Will has loosened up a little with me. He lost a bit of that steel in his eyes. He even asked for my help with some designs. Well, that's encouraging. But I'm afraid I have some real concerns with this winery proposal. I'm going to let Will and Flynn present their proposal to Council. But... I can't support it. But Gran, they're making it to benefit all of us. Oh, Emma. I watched your own grandfather lose everything with that vineyard. Will and Tracey's parents too. I don't want to watch the next generation make the same mistakes. They have done the math. They are making it as a tourist destination and events center. So it's going to have consistent revenue. They're business people. If the numbers didn't work, they wouldn't want to develop it. I don't believe they're in this to stick around. Oh, they'll set it up, they'll have a big fancy opening, then they'll move back to San Francisco to their tech jobs. Leaving the people of Harmony Valley working to support this albatross. No. They would not set us up to fail. Especially not Tracey. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I don't believe in this project. And I can't support it at Council. Good night, Gran. Good night, Em. I'm just going out for a bike ride, Gran. I won't be long. [bike chain rattles] Oh man. -Hey. -Oh. Hey Will. Did you bike break down? Yup. Seems to be the problem. Ah. Oh no no no no. Don't. I got this. Oh. Okay. You're a good assistant. I try. Let's check the gears for you. Nice flower. Right. I, ah... Umm. There was some over there. I picked... Remember Tracey and I, we used to love picking wildflowers. We loved them even more than the prize winning roses in your mom's garden. We'd make all those crowns, and take the dandelion seeds and blow them out into the fields, make hundreds of wishes. We were going to be princesses when we grew up. There was like hundreds of crowns in the bedroom. Tracey used to say that I was the frog. Well, I'll have you know, I actually like frogs. And toads. They're very important to the ecosystem. -Are they? -Uh huh. Hmm. Hey, I was going to check out the Baxter County Winery this afternoon. If you want to join me Yeah. Yeah, I would like that. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Great. It's a date. Sorry. I didn't mean that. Yeah. I didn't take it that way. Maybe give me an hour and I'll change. [Mayor Leo] Hey Will. All set with your presentation? Mayor Leo. Yes sir. We have a robust package put together for you. Hi Emma! I heard you were home. Are you running your design firm from here? Yeah. Virtual office. I hope you'll stick around and lend your skills to the winery. I definitely believe in the project. I'll be there tomorrow to fight for what's right. I hope we can all agree on what that is. See you both tomorrow. All right. Sounds like I might need to prepare a few more counterpoints, some kickback on that proposal. Yeah. Hey, I might need to take a raincheck on that little winery thing this afternoon. I got to get prepared. Of course. I get it. Good luck. Yeah. Whosh. Hey, thanks for... Thanks for helping. That is awesome. Thank you. See you. [Rose] Just so you know, I'm shutting down this foolishness as quickly as possible. Hi Gran. Oh listen, if I clutch my heart with my right hand, I'm faking a heart attack to end this. If I clutch with my left, call an ambulance. Not happening. [Mayor Leo] Thank you all for coming. Please take your seats and we'll get started. Judging by the size of today's crowd, I see that there's a good deal of interest in our new business agenda. So, Will Jackson and Flynn Rutherford, please proceed with your bid for approval to re-open Harmony Valley Vineyard and revitalize our town. Mayor Leo, I think we just need the broad strokes here. There's no point in spending a lot of time on this. Councilor Rose, the floor recognizes Will and Flynn. They're allotted their thirty minutes. [Mayor Leo] Flynn, Will, the floor is yours. Thanks, Mayor Leo. Ah! It feels great to be back. Just like most of you, Flynn and I, we were born and raised here in Harmony Valley. And we just love this town so much. It feels like just the other day I was a little boy swimming down at Eagle Lake. I just loved those days. My teenage years, going down to the drive-in. I know a lot of you have done that. Well, right after college, Finn and I, we had to go out to Silicon Valley to finish developing our app. And, our hearts were always here though. And we were lucky enough to find success, and we want to give back to the place that we love. Because hopefully one day I'll be lucky enough to raise my kids here. I don't know about Flynn. [everyone laughs] So essentially, what we are proposing here today is that we open this beautiful place of ours to hundreds of visitors. [crowd disagrees] Now just hold on, hold on. [crowd mumbling] Now let me explain. When you create employment and stability, that's how you keep the bright young minds at home and move us into the future. So I present to you the revitalization of the new Harmony Valley Vineyards. The expanded vineyard will bring in tourism, and plenty of revenue for small business owners like all of you. It will create about a hundred year-round jobs. And with the mill about to shut down, Harmony Valley needs new employment. So in phase one, together with our developers, we'll break ground on the new buildings here, at the end of the month. That, that's the easy part. Men and women alike, they'll love our water spa. And couples, they're going to scramble to book our gorgeous wedding venue. And families, they're going to flock from all around to get to our water park. And in phase two, we will update the aging technology infrastructure. And in phase three, we will revitalize old Main Street with a much needed face lift that maintains the small town charm that we all know and love. We have detailed handouts here for anyone who would like. Who doesn't want new jobs? A stronger cell phone signal? New shops and amenities, anyone? Gentlemen. Your plan is exciting. Thanks Rose. But can it be sustained over the long run? What kind of family brings their children to a vineyard, when they can go to the theme park across the state line? What if couples would rather get married in the rooftop garden of some skyscraper in the city? You know, if your romantic vision doesn't work, you can go home to your tech jobs and you'll leave the town here to pick up the pieces. And... Rose. Is something wrong? Where's the old bandshell? Ah, what bandshell? The bandshell that's been in the center of town since we were founded? [crowd murmuring] In this rendition, we thought a parking lot would be a great center piece for all the new amenities, wonderful amenities we haven't mentioned yet. We're going to get to it right now. That old bandshell was where my husband proposed to me. And you want to destroy it and put in a parking lot? [murmuring] That bandshell has stood the test of time. I think I know how I'm voting. Oh no. Rose, these are just initial designs. Everything here is still open for suggestion. Where's the skating rink? Well that would need to be relocated. It's only used for a few months of the year and it's a prime spot that we figure would be better used for the town spa. I skate there all winter long, every morning before I open the restaurant. One... This plan is disrespectful to our public spaces. Two... This winery will be a millstone around our necks if it doesn't work out. And I've already lived through that once already, thank you very much. And three... this 'revitalization' is nothing more than change for change's sake. Technology is not going to make our town better. I say we take a vote. Well, we're not done. Rose, we can't. I've heard enough. I'd like to take a vote. Seconded. With all due respect, this just simply isn't fair. We've heard enough of your presentation. I've asked for a vote. Mayor? All those in favor? Opposed? [Mayor Leo] The nays have it. Denied. [gavel pounds] Thank you everyone. [crowd murmuring] Rose. Rose Rose Rose. You shut us down and you didn't even let us finish. Council decided that what you proposed wasn't worth further consideration. Well you didn't even see the new daycare for the kids. There's a whole upgrade on the public pool that shut down. I mean a whole new wing on the retirement home. This town is fifty percent baby boomers and older, and, what, the retirement facilities could house a quarter of you. Then you should have started with that instead of showing our memories being demolished. Rose, they are just initial designs. [Emma] Okay, what if Will redid his plan? Took into consideration some of things that this town loves. Then him and Flynn can repitch again in a couple of weeks. All right. Thank you. Both of you. And Rose, I promise I will keep the history. Oh, you and Flynn don't even know what that means. I apologize. [Man] Hey Will. We're with you. Hey, Emma. You want to get this whole thing approved, right? Well, of course. I think it would be really great for Tracey. And the town. Right. Yeah. Why don't you help me with the revised proposal? I mean, you know Rose and Tanya and the rest of them. I just need someone to help get me an idea about what everyone wants. Well, I know nothing about town planning. Well, you don't need to. You know the town, you know the people. You know design. Yeah. Okay. For Tracey. For Tracey. What are you two conspiring about? Ah, Emma's going to consult on the new proposal. Well, that's just about the smartest thing I've heard all day. See you later. [Will] So what do you think next? Ah... We could do that recon on the other wineries that you were talking about. Oh. Fine. But we can't let the competition know who we are, though. So we're going to need some disguises. -Absolutely. -Uh huh. So, ah, do you have a secret time and place? Tomorrow afternoon? Lunch at the house first? -Okay. -Okay. That's not so secret. We'll see you then. See you. Hey guys. Really nice job on your presentation. This guy. -Hey. -Hey. You look nice Will. It's a business meeting, right? Of course. Just a business meeting. -I brought a pie. -Oh wow. -You want to come on in. -Yeah. [Will] You look nice, too. Tracey's in the kitchen. Tracey! What... I got a day pass because I'm coming home. That's amazing news. No more hospital food. [Will] Awesome. Isn't that great news? I won't bother you two. I'll be out at the barbecue. If you need me, holler. Is my brother being nice to you? He is. So you'll help him get this passed? Hey, if you want to work at the winery, I will do everything I can to help it get approved. You know you're going to have to ask every Council member, one by one, right? Yes. Yes. The personal touch. I think we'll start with Felix because he's kind of a wild card. If we can get him on side... I can't wait to be home. I just want to put everything behind me and start fresh. Tracey. You know that every morning when I wake up, I wish it had been me and not you. I know. It wasn't your fault Emma. [Emma breathing heavily] [Emma hears squealing tires, smashing sounds] [Tracey] If I could do anything, I would make you understand that. [Will] Dinner's ready. Talk to me. [Tracey] Are you okay? Are you all right? [takes a big breath] [Will] What happened? [Emma] I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about the accident. [Will] Glass of water? Sure. Thanks.

I'm just happy to focus on helping those that actually want my help. [baby goat bleats] Well, you're doing incredible job. You looking to adopt a goat? Or a rabbit, maybe? They make great pets.

Oh, that's great. You want me to take the lead? I know how to handle things with Felix. Yeah, of course. I'm happy staying here and cuddling the bunnies. Oh, yeah, hey. You were a rabbit person. Yeah, I was and still am. I'm going to let you have little bunny cuddles. And I'm going to go land this vote. -Good luck. -Thanks. Hey. Oh. Felix. Ah, I was wondering what you think it would take to get your vote on our new plan? Sorry, Will. No can do. I don't set foot in there anymore. Really. You still got a vote on the council. You got a seat. Your vote matters. That is just a courtesy given to an outgoing mayor. Not one I'm going to take advantage of. [Will] Look. I feel like if you just... No. Will! It's not going to happen. Will you just take a peak? Here. Take this. Brush this horse. Make this beauty ready and looking good for adoption day at the Fall Festival. -Fall Festival, huh? -Uh huh. Okay. I got you. Hey Felix, whatever happened to that idea you had to build a new playground at Victoria Park? Ah, jeez, that was a heartbreaker. I mean, every year, I'd tell them we need to upgrade the park. And every year the budget cops would just shut me down. Three terms as mayor, I was happy to leave. It would have been really nice to get that passed, though huh? Yeah, it would of. I mean, it's my only regret. If I could have gotten that done for the kids, then I guess it would have been all worthwhile. Well, that's actually, that's a pretty great coincidence. I mean, part of our new development plan, it includes a whole new upgrade to the park, a whole new development, you know. A whole new playground for the kids. Yeah, yeah. We were thinking of asking the kids in the community to help out with the design. Really? Did you go to the schools, because they could run some sort of competition. Absolutely. You know what? In fact, with your vote next week, I would, Emma and I would really love to sit down with you, hear all the things you want to include in the park. I mean, we could even name it after you. Right? Yeah. Come on. Wouldn't it feel good to get that one last item checked off your list? Okay. It definitely would. And Felix Rumsford Park has a very nice ring to it. Okay. I'll tell you what. You get the park in there, you get my vote. Hey, fantastic! Thank you. -We definitely will. -Okay. Oh, I hope you guys brought some gloves. You've got to clip the bunnies' nails next. Never done that before. Excellent. Thanks guys. Yeah. No worries. Hey! Great work. Good job. I'm glad you guys all find this funny. They're just bunnies, Will. How much damage could they do? It's emotional wounds, guys. [everyone laughs] Well tomorrow I'll go sit in front of a computer all day, and you can go and try to cuddle these little guys, and you can see. No, I'm good. But did you get his vote? No. I didn't. But, ah... Well Emma. She got it. It really wasn't that hard. I knew you both wanted the same thing. So I just had to show him. What about Tanya? She loved it, I mean, she loved the design of the skate park. Really, she loved it. Emphasis on 'loved'. And emphasis on 'it was my idea'. I love the way that the skating path winds through the park in the winter and becomes a children's bike and stroller path in the summer. It's, it's the best thing to happen to that park. What can I say? I was struck with inspiration. Well, I'm expecting the revised blueprint for the bike paths for tomorrow, so... Guess you two are quite the team. Well it's not over yet. We still need Dr. Basi and Pete. I figure the more Councilors we can get on board then we'll have their committees set for permits. I'm seeing Dr. Basi in the next couple days. He promised he's going to hear me out. What about your Gran? Unfortunately, I don't think she's going to budge. She just doesn't believe in the wine business, even though we all know it's viable. And she definitely doesn't care about upgrades in our tech. Even though the rest of us would kill for better cell phone reception. I will work on her, I promise. Okay, why don't you sit by the fire with me? [Will] Yes. I was talking to Tracey, Will. I knew that. That was so awkward. I knew that. I was going to ask you to do the same. That's why. A penny for your thoughts. Hmm. They're not worth that much. [both laugh] I've had a really nice few days. With Will? Red cheeks. Dead giveaway! That's not fair. The fire's hot. Yes. With Will. It's been, it's been really cathartic for me. That's good, right? Yeah. Yeah, you know for the first time in awhile, I can really feel myself being happy again. ♪ [upbeat music] ♪ Come together ♪ ♪ I can feel it crawling underneath my skin ♪ ♪ Linger on my fingertips ♪ ♪ The pride in me won't let you in ♪ ♪ Come together ♪ ♪ I can see you swinging like a wrecking ball ♪ ♪ A part of me says let you go ♪ ♪ A part of me says no I'll wait until tomorrow ♪ ♪ I will wait until the light of morning ♪ ♪ I will wait until the sun comes up ♪ [music ends] I'm not sure what emotion it is that I'm feeling right now.

We were just admiring your selection here. Ah. Never too early to make the big choices. Yes, indeed. Please. So Pete. The reason that we're here today... You want my vote for your big vineyard proposal. We do. Yes. And we've been pretty hard at work on this. So if you want to take a look. We have designed a new skate path so it goes all the way around the park. That way, more families can enjoy it. And the skate rental shop is right here. With blade sharpening? Yeah, of course. Very nice. You've done a really lovely job. Especially around the old bandshell. [Will] Oh, I couldn't agree more. But that's not just our idea. I mean, Emma here, she recommended that maybe I ask the people what they wanted. So, Pete. The floor is yours. What do you think? This here. Those are the offices for the vineyard. So that's where all the corporate meetings, behind the scenes things would happen. Could you let me put some subtle marketing there? What are you thinking? Oh, you know, clouds, flowers, inspirational sayings. How about an art exhibit that the funeral home could sponsor? Yes! Inspirational works by local artists, maybe. Yeah. I'm on the Arts Council over at Harrisburg. And I curate the art show at the Fall Festival. There's so much talent that needs a place to be seen. Sounds like it's a good idea to me. It's positive and it supports the community. I think it would be really nice for everyone. You have my vote. Really? Okay. Pete, thanks. That's great. I appreciate that. I've got a little something to give to you here. -It's a little brochure. -Okay. Forgive me if I'm being too personal, but you two make a really cute couple. [together] Oh. This is just business. Ah. My mistake. Thanks for your time. How crazy was that? Yeah, I know. Going in there, I didn't think we'd get his vote. I mean, he's just like my Granny. He must have seen our vision. I meant what he said at the end about us. Oh. Yeah. We were just sharing the project with him. I don't know what made him think we were a couple? Right. As if we'd ever be together. Yeah. So Pete was the last one. With Felix, Susan and Tanya we got four votes. And Flynn said Dr Basi is still on the fence but he's willing to listen at the town meeting next week. So, that just leaves Rose. -Yeah. -Yeah. So if everyone votes according to their promises, that's four to two. The numbers are on our side. Huh. You okay? Yeah. I guess this is it right? What do you mean? Well, I held up my end of the bargain. I helped you get the votes. So... Hmm. I'll see you at the meeting. Okay. You want to grab a drink and celebrate? Let's wait until after we get those votes, okay? Hey. I can smell those from here. I thought these could do with some refreshing. Working on your client's project again? Yeah. I'm just trying to find any moment between working with Will on the plans. Interesting way of putting it. 'Working on the plans'. You know, it's funny, my Gran always says if you want to say something, you should just say it. I'm just saying, I hope you're still working on this project with the town's best interest in mind. Absolutely. That's what I've done this entire time. I'm doing this for Tracey. There's literally nothing in it for me. Well then. I've spoken out of turn. I apologize. Have a flower. Thanks. Oh, Em, I'm sorry. I've overstepped, haven't I? Unfortunately, I'm very good at that. Listen to your heart, Em. Don't grow old and cynical like me. Gran's orders. Aye aye, captain. That's my girl. [Rose singing] Da da dum da da da dum... [phone buzzes] [band playing instruments] [Rose] Nice finger work. You've been working hard. I can tell. How are they not going to be the cutest thing at the Fall Festival? They're perfect. [Rose] What I'm handing out here is the music that we're going to be playing at the Fall Festival. [Rose] And it's called Country Fair Parade. What's wrong? I was just thinking about something that your brother said. It's nothing. Really. Fine. You know Pete the funeral home guy? Yeah. Well, he thought Will and I were a couple. And then later on, Will said "as if we'd ever be together." And I know he was just reacting to what Pete had said. And before you go there, I don't know why it bothers me. Because it's Will. Exactly, it's Will. [Tracey shouts] Ow! [Rose] Ladies... We're trying to rehearse a concert here. Sorry Gran. [Felix] Hey everyone! Oh. The table's shaping up. Shhh! [whispers] We just got yelled at too. From the top then. [Rose] Yes dear. We can't play without Susan. There's no one to keep tempo. Well, I'm sorry dear. But Susan wasn't able to make it in to play the snare drum today and I'm all thumbs. So we're just going to have to do the best we can. I can help. What are we playing? The Country Fair Parade. My lucky day. We used to play this when I was in the band. [Rose] All right then. Two, three, four. ♪ [band plays] [Rose, quietly] I'm going to put a stop to this. It's not going to happen. Hey man. Are you good? Yeah. I'm good. Just looking for Emma. I messaged her a bunch of times, but she's not replying. I was hoping she'd be here. Not sitting with Will and Flynn? I've done everything I can do. I'm sure they can handle it. Here's to hoping they get you a nice cushy job, and give this town a little boost. Fingers crossed. Okay everyone. Thank you for coming. If you could make your way to your seats, we'd like to get things started shortly. [Will] I don't like that Susan is whispering to Rose. Bike trail or not, nothing good's going to come of that. Our numbers aren't looking good either. They're looking better now. [Rose] Well now Felix. This is twice this week you've surprised me. Good to know you not only have musical talent but an interest in your civic duty. It's always my pleasure, Rose. I just really want that playground and I can almost taste victory. [gavel bangs twice] [Mayor Leo] That's good to know, Felix. Welcome. Will Jackson and Flynn Rutherford, the floor is yours. [crowd clapping] And Emma Willoughby. Emma's been a big help in this as well. I just want to make sure that was noted. [crowd clapping] [Mayor Leo] Fantastic. Let's start with Flynn, Will and Emma's revamped proposal. It's nice to see everyone's back again. Felix, nice to see you. Before we get started I just wanted to say last time that we were here, we messed up. I was arrogant. I was cocky. And I forgot what makes this town so great. It's our memories. Our wholesomeness. I mean, when I hear people driving down our Main Street, I've heard it a thousand times before. They wish that they lived here. [crowd murmurs agreement] And thankfully, I was reminded of that. So without any more further delay. I'd like to present to you the new, blended with the best traditions, Harmony Valley Vineyards. [Flynn] We listen to everyone. And we're confident that we understand what you love about this town. Including... Bike trails. A big playground. And, ice pads. And... [Flynn and Will together] Our beloved bandshell! [crowd clapping] Harmony Valley Vineyards will not only bring in new year-round jobs, and new tourism, and new amenities. It will also become a destination. And it will give this town new memories that stand in partnership with the old. As you've told us, that is the most important thing of all. This is all well and good. But what happens ten years from now? I'm not sure I understand? You create this fancy 'destination' here, and when things don't go well, you leave the town dealing with empty buildings and unpaid bills. And if it does goes well, what then? Um, I guess we all enjoy the success. Young man. Success is the father of greed. When things go well, people want more. New plans, more disruptions. Exactly. But we'll have control of those decisions. Your outside investors... How much are they buying in for? Thirty-four percent. They are making a substantial investment. Okay, thirty-four percent. Which means you two have thirty-three percent each? Yes it does. Then neither of you are the majority stockholder. What happens when one or both of you sell your shares? When your original investor wants to expand, he'll be in charge. Not you. Right. Rose, we plan to vote together in Harmony Valley's best interest. We have no intention to sell. We're here for the long term. But you could. [Emma] Will and Flynn are committed to this project. They're not going to do something that would jeopardize Harmony Valley. Oh, not on purpose. But we all know they could. I'm sorry. I think we've heard enough to vote, yes? All those in favor? Opposed? [Mayor Leo] Harmony Valley Vineyards will not be approved for development at this time. [bangs gavel] [indistinct chattering] [Mayor Leo] Thank you lady and gentlemen for your efforts. I'd also like to wish everyone a fantastic Fall Festival. [indistinct chattering] [Emma] It's okay. It's just a minor setback. But you can go to your development, ask for more time. We can pitch again... Emma. It's over. Our deal was to break ground by the end of this week. And if we don't, our partner pulls out. And we lose everything. I am so sorry. Yeah. Me too. Is there anything we can do? Will! Come on. I know it's a setback, but there's still time. We'll try again next year. No, I'm done fighting, Tracey. I'm moving back to San Francisco. -What? -Why? Because this town doesn't need me! I tried everything possible to please everyone and it didn't work. But I don't want you to go. Tracey, without the vineyard, I have to go back to work. There's nothing else here for me. Okay? Wow. Emma, that is not what I meant. It's fine. [Tracey] What about me? Do you want to go back to seeing each other once a year like we used to, just for Christmas? I need you here! Well, then come back to San Francisco with me. I live here now. Tracey... Can we just talk about this later? I just can't just think straight right now, you guys. Tracey, come on. I'm walking home! It's okay. Will. I'll make sure she gets home. You're coming home late. I spent the day with Tracey. And you're so mad we're not even going to talk about it? Okay. Tracey's furious. One. She doesn't want to move away for work. Two. She doesn't want to live hundreds of miles away from her brother. And three, if Will's gone that means she has to stay in the hospital longer because she's not going to be well enough to live on her own for awhile. Perhaps I should have given more thought to how this would affect her. Do you think? Gran, I try to understand you. I do. But I really wish you would trust me, even a little bit. I did address your concerns on the project. I made sure the plans benefited everyone. It was good for the town, it was good for Tracey. You promised to be fair, and you still didn't hear them out. I see. So Tracey and I were the only reason you were helping? Oh come on. Enough hinting. Yes, I like Will. He is a good man, with good ideas. And believe it or not, he just wanted to help. Nonsense. I don't believe that. You always tell me to leave the past behind. And yet you let your one bitter memory of grandpa consume you. Have you forgotten about all the good memories of his vineyards? You met at the winery's Fall Festival. You were so proud of the wine he created for your wedding. You do know that half the families in this town own homes because of the jobs he created. Grandpa had fifty years of great success and all you remember is the last few years when bad weather made the harvest fail. I'm sorry Emma. I've let the whole town down. I do know Will's a good man. I like his heart, his spirit. I'll apologize tomorrow. It's too late. Will's done fighting where he's not wanted. He said there's nothing left for him here. I just didn't want everyone to suffer again. We are already suffering. The mill is closing. We need new development. And I wish you'd stop being afraid to try. [breathing heavily] [gasping for air] Emma! [Emma gasping] Emma, sweetheart. Breathe. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. [Rose] Where's my phone? Breathe. [gasping] [Rose] I can't get a signal! Emma. Emma. I'm with you here honey I'm with you sweetheart. Relax. Relax. Help! Help! [door closes] Oh, this is pathetic. Whatever. Whatever? [Flynn] Let me guess. You want to give up on the winery so you can have more time to feel miserable? That sounds like a plan. Quitting and moving away from everything you care about is not a plan. Sure. Sure. You've had a thing for Emma your entire life. And instead of fighting for her, here you are, moping at your kitchen counter. So? What? I don't know. Tell me how you plan to win Emma back! I messed up. Yeah. You did. I really care about her. You always have. You like her, she likes you. You said things that might have hurt her. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Make a plan. Hey hey hey. I'm all out of plan. Okay? [Will's phone buzzes] No .No. [machine beeping] About time. Hey. How long have I been out? A year. -What? -Yeah. So much has happened I don't even know where to start. -You! -I'm kidding. It's been a couple of hours. I hate seeing you here. You know, the upside is, they make a mean bread pudding on Tuesdays. It's actually really good. I can't wait. Talk to me about the panic attacks, Em. I wish, I wish there was a better word for sorry. But I am, Tracey. I'm so sorry. I wish that, that night I had've done something to avoid it, but... I just... And then after the accident, I had to go back to the city for treatment. The nightmares took over. Even during the day. It was so real. Like it wouldn't stop happening to me. I could just, see the truck coming at us. The sound of the brakes, the tires, the impact. Like it just kept happening again and again. And I really, I really wanted to be here for you. But I knew if I left the city it would just get worse. And now? It's better now. It's... It's manageable. They still wake me up every morning. I guess not as many during the day but, most nights. I love you, Emma. We're going to be okay. You know sometimes an accident is just an accident. You know I lost my bracelet in the crash. I felt like I lost a part of you too. Emma, I'm right here. I'm right here. This just a symbol. If anything, it's a reason for us to go shopping for a new one. I love you so much, Tracey. Hey. Hey. How are you feeling? Yeah. I'm better. They let me go out of the hospital shortly after you left. Oh good. I know it's not the same, but I used to get panic attacks too when we're releasing that app. They suck. Yeah, they do. I got a lot of stuff to do today. I should probably let you go. Yeah. Well. I got to get running too. Okay. I'll see you. Why couldn't you see us together? What do you mean? When Pete thought we made a cute couple, you said "As if we'd be together". Well, I don't remember saying that exactly. But if I did, I guess, I don't know, I thought maybe you hated me. That you thought I was stuck up or something. Will, I have never hated you. In fact, I actually thought that there was something between us this last little while. I thought that maybe I could finally forgive myself and that you were ready to. And then you said that, and, I don't know, I guess it was in my head. No no no no, Em. There's nothing to forgive. Look, I realize that now. When Tracey was hurt, I was so angry. And when I got here and you were gone, I blamed the whole thing on you. But if I'm being honest with myself, that I realized that I needed you here with me. To help me out with this all. I just couldn't understand how you could leave but I get it now. And I understand it, okay? I'm just... I am so sorry, Em. I knew one day you'd say that. You know, I've been running this road for a week now, hoping you'd bike past. [chuckles] You have? Em, I... It's not easy for me to say this but... I love you. And I've been in love with you since we were kids. I love you too, Will. So much. ♪ [fun rhythmic music] ♪ ♪ [band plays] ♪ [crowd cheers and claps] Rose, I'm just going to say a few words, if that's okay. Yeah. Hi Harmony Valley! I'm Will Jackson. I see a few Councilors out there. Mayor Leo, Councilor Rose. I was hoping that you guys would reconsider our proposal and put us on your docket again. Because we need a strong safety system here. And a key part of that is reliable cell phone signals. Because when Emma Willoughby here needed help, her grandmother Rose couldn't get a connection to get an ambulance. Now when any of us has an emergency, the seconds count. Now we have the technology available to fix this problem. And we need to come together and do that. That's all. Thank you. [clapping] I second that. [surprised murmurings in the crowd] Our infrastructure needs upgrading. Will. Talk to us about tech for safety. I could also do with some more information on that splash pool. [laughter] Council meeting, Thursday, six o'clock. Let's get this winery approved! [clapping, cheering] [indistinct conversations] Thank you both for keeping this old bandshell in the plans. I think of your grandfather every time I walk by. And you said a winery was a romantic notion. You, Rose, are the romantic of this town. Rose, if Council does allows us to go ahead with this, Flynn and I were talking and we've agreed to give Tracey fifty-one percent of the project. So Tracey will control it. And we all know that you trust her. I do. [Tracey] Thank you. And I'm sure Emma approves as well. Oh, I love you, sweetheart. Okay Rose, I need something deep fried. Share something delicious with me? Ah. No can do Tracey. I've got arm wrestling in fifteen minutes. I'm up against Earl Ivey. Come on. Do you remember that year that Tracey was sick and couldn't make it out to the Festival? Oh. Yeah. My Gran wouldn't let me go by myself. We were twelve. And so I asked you to come with me. That's right. We ate so many of those little mini donuts. Oh! Hot out of the fryer. With the cinnamon sugar. That was the best day of my life. You know, in my heart, I just always loved you then. It just took a while to know it in my head. I got you something. A charm bracelet. Will. The shooting star, that's from Tracey. She says it's for good things.
