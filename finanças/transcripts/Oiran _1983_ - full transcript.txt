There's still one client left. Who that might be? Hachibei, the merchant. Hachibei, huh? That old man is very hard to satisfy. I can’t serve any more clients today, it is not possible. But today is still your workday. It costs 100 yen to come to Kirise, right? I wonder if there is anyone who can generously pay me 100 yen? 100 yen, you say? You might have to spend 500 nights to get that money. But who would pay you that much? You should stop dreaming, yes? I will give you something good later. Could it be that Kisuke is visiting? Who knows? I will bring your customer now. Come now, Ayame has been waiting for you. Here. Ayame, are you ready to have fun tonight? I appreciate you paying a visit. You can skip the bowing part. Let’s get right into it. I can't stay for too long tonight. Oh, Master! Your socks. Please, have a good time. My undergarment is in the way. Namu amida butsu. Namu amida butsu. Namu amida butsu. Namu amida butsu. Namu amida butsu. Namu amida butsu. Mister, you shouldn't peek. What are you doing, you fool? Go away, scram! Please do as he says and move over. What's up with him? Oh my! It's so good! Hey. Thank you. Please, have a good time. No! What are you doing?! I want to see you naked. Show me your back! No, I don't want it. You act like a savage, Mister. Show me your back. I beg you! That's not how it works! Your upper arm looks pretty. I bet it's the same for your back. You are such an annoying guest! Just finish it quickly and leave! Your legs and thighs are white and smooth. Surely, your butt and back are also... What are you doing, pervert? That's enough! No! Go away! Hey, be quiet! - You are distracting me! - Shut up! You are the one who should be quiet and stop moaning! What did you just say? Damn it. Mister! Don't fight, all right? It's delicious, it's delicious! Come on, I beg you. Show me your back. No way! I am not an animal. I can’t show you my back like that. A woman’s main part is here! I will pay you as much as you want. How disgusting! Mister, this is a 1 yen bill, right? You can have all the money you want. Are you giving me this? Show me your back now. All right. But this place is too cheap for this amount of money. Mister, would you spend the night with me? Is it fine if I do it? Usually, you’d have to become a regular guest for that, but I will do something about it. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Let me kiss you! A kiss! But that's... You know I am a regular here! Only a person I genuinely like can do it. That’s the vow I made. Come on, stop being so prude. Let me have your nipples, then. Oh my... hey... Oh... Oh? I want to come. Now... right now! I can’t help it, too. I am coming, I am coming. - I am coming. - Let’s come together. Together! Here, you can wipe it. Since I'm a mess now, please excuse me for a moment. Hey, where are you going? To the toilet. Please wait. Uh... uh... hey! Kisuke! Ayame! Cord... Untie the cord… Ah, tongue, tongue... You want my tongue? Okay, get naked right now. Calm down, Mister. Are you a doctor, perhaps? No, I am a tattooist. - A tattooist? - That’s right. I draw tattoos. Ah, so that’s why you wanted to see my back so badly. My dream is to make a tattoo showing a spider having sex with a woman. I have the composition, but the pretty skin, which is crucial, is missing. That’s why, after visiting various places in Japan, I came all the way to Nagasaki to find the perfect skin. Let me tell you in advance, I am not interested in getting a tattoo. I didn’t say you would. I just want to see your skin a little. That’s all there is to it, really. The skin you want to see... is like this. This is the skin I have been looking for. This is the skin! You're tickling me! You sure are lecherous, Mister. I beg you! Let me draw a tattoo on it! - Please! - I refuse. You'll receive the life of my tattoo to become a real woman. The spider will be having sex with your flesh, and your body will be having sex with men in this world, sucking their blood. What a ridiculous thing to say. Let’s just sleep together. I will suck your blood instead. Come on, hurry up! Sorry for messing up your hair. It's okay. It's been giving me a neck ache since this morning. I'll have to take it down, anyway. - Sorry about that. - Well... What is this... book you're looking at? You mean this? It's the work of Hokusai. Hokusai, huh? He's great, isn't he? It might be the same type of illustrated book, but unlike other authors who draw kabuki actors as females, Hokusai draws real women. So, there are many people who want to borrow it when I walk around with this. Look! This position here... - Can anyone do this? - Of course they can. That’s because Hokusai is inspired by real life people. Let's try it, then! You want to try that? Come on, let's do it! I wonder if we can do this. I doubt it. Three times in a row is too much. Who cares about that? I'm sure you can manage it. Your legs go this way... Then, the knees... Like this? That's right. And then I do it like this. Like that. Kisuke, don’t pull your waist. - Do it right, like this. - It tickles. It's okay! It somewhat feels slippery. That's fine. I will put my right arm around your neck. Put your left arm around me, will you? The right arm should support the weight, right? Just try lifting my waist... And put it in, like that. This is somewhat difficult. Ah, good, that’s good. Now try grabbing my boobs. Like this? Like this, right? It’s tightening! Do you think we look like the drawing now? I think so. I can’t see anything, though. It’s frustrating! I want to see us! Wait a second, yes? Let me bring the mirror. This ceramic patterned mirror shines so much. One of the sailors called Bob gave it to me. This is the position! - I can see it clearly. - Is that so? I can’t see anything at all. I only see my knees. Does this work now? Please hold it that way, I can see it properly like that. Can you see it now? Now I can! It looks exactly like Hokusai’s drawing. When you hold my body roughly like this, it sure looks scary. There's no way for me to avoid your groin. I fit in like a helmet fits on a head. I can't help it, either! I can’t see anything at all. When did this happen? When? I don’t care about the mirror anymore. Just do it right! Make me more aroused! That's it! Beware of fire! Beware of fire! Good morning, Master. It's dawn already. Yeah... Is it time for me to leave? If you don’t wake up, you will be late. No, it wasn’t comfortable. I hardly slept. Let’s extend our stay. Yes, we will be extending your stay. What should we do about food? Food? Bring some here for two people. Yes. Have you heard the news, Yanoguchi? Heard what, Naruto? Miyono has been having passionate sex with that guy named Seikichi. Apparently, they've been doing it for three nights straight already. Wow, three nights, huh? That's a long time! The helper told me that she kept moaning and didn’t touch the food at all. Was it like that? Such a talented guy he is! If I were her, my back would break at this point. Isn’t this Seikichi the same guy who made a scene the other day? That's right. This means that Miyono got along with him, then. She really likes doing it, anyway. No, I'd say she likes it too much! This is good enough. The effect of the chloroform is wearing off. How do you feel, Miyono? I don't know why but my back is hurting. Mister, are you satisfied now? Both your body and soul are my possessions now. Huh? This is disgusting. What is this on my skin? Don’t worry about a thing. That is the symbol of your soul. I feel a somewhat burning sensation. Do you desire men? Why are you asking that? - Come, let’s go to the bath. - Huh? - Why to the bath? - You need hot water for recoloring. Recoloring? What for? For the spider tattoo that now controls your life. Tattoo? On my back? This is a tattoo that I have been researching for a long time. Look at it carefully. Is this really on my back? It’s such a beautiful tattoo. Seikichi. I guess this means I am yours now. I'll become a real woman like this. Come now, we have to finish it properly. Let’s go to the bath. But guests are not supposed to enter there. I don’t care about that. They are all still busy doing it. No one is going to the bath now. Now, get dressed so that nobody can see it. Here we are. Lay down on the floor. It’s permeating! Be patient, that hot water will maintain the tattoo alive! It's embarrassing. What are you doing to me? Ouch, it hurts! Seikichi! It's clean now, Miyono. I got it. Have sex with me. I want to forget this pain! Hurry up and fuck me now! Hurry up! Hurry up! The courtesan is coming! The courtesan is coming! I am so glad... that I have become a real woman! I have never felt this good before! The soul inside my body is burning you, and I also want to follow you with the fire! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's how you do it! It’s as if you know my body inside and out. Honey! Honey... honey! Honey! I'm so embarrassed! It's unbearable! I have never felt this good before! This is my first time, Seikichi! Fuck me more! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! I was wrong. Yours is the skin I have been really looking for. I really want it! I want your life! I want it! I want it! I want it! Miyono, look, it's your patron. Seikichi. Master! Oh my, it's you, sir. Miyono is waiting for you eagerly. Granny, I want the courtesan tonight. What do you mean? You're Miyono's patron, after all... Silence! I intend to have Ayame, the courtesan, tonight. But you see... Bring me Ayame right away! Yes, with pleasure! Hello! Welcome! Lady Ayame, the courtesan, is here! Lady Ayame, the courtesan, is here! We congratulate you! You, please come here. You can approach me. I saw you at the bath earlier! That’s rude, the children are watching. Please show me your skin! Please let me see your skin! Wait, wait! Don't go! Leave me alone! Follow me, children! - Yes! - Wait! I'm coming! Dear Ayame, you shouldn't say such a thing. He is a rich man, you see? It's very uncommon for a guest to pay 50 yen at once. Now, think again and go back to your seat of honor, okay? O-Tatsu, I certainly appreciate your advice. But I will have to refuse this time. Why, I ask? Are you trying to damage my reputation? Very well, I will tell your boss about this. You will be punished for this! That's fine with me. I am Ayame and I serve with class. I won’t accept any guest I don’t like. Hey, who is this? We are having a serious conversation here! Ah, it's you, Ageha. Ayame, we need to talk. Feel free to come in. O-Tatsu, we need to speak in private. Please leave us alone, yes? I understand. Ayame, it might not be my place to give you any advices, but since I've been working here longer, please think of me as an older sister and listen. We sleep with a lot of men every night. Some may be charming, and some may be annoying. But, you see, Ayame, do you think every guest... who comes here only does so because they desire our bodies? Every guest who visits us has a very lonely heart. They feel lonely, so they want to be saved by us. Just like an unreasonable child seeking for his mother's attention, they come and pray to us, substitute Buddhist saints, to soothe their aching hearts. Buddhist saints are like the Buddha himself. I don't think this job is suitable for you if you disagree with this precept. Ageha, I apologize. I have not been humble as a courtesan. I have been spoiled by compliments. I only picked the guests I liked, and let go those I did not. That was nothing but my selfishness. Ageha... From now on, I’ll change my ways. Please forgive me for what I have done so far. Ayame... Damn, she is sure taking long. What is this? A dream perhaps? It must be. Didn’t you want to see my skin? It can't be! Watch out! What's with you? Be more careful! Kisuke! Kisuke! Hey, don't speak so loud. Kisuke, it’s an emergency! The tattooist Seikichi bought Ayame. But that’s how her job works. What can I do? But it’s still an emergency! How come? - There's no time to waste. - Why? Huh? Oh! Wow... what an astonishing tattoo! - Hey! Come see! - She has a beautiful skin! - Is she the one? - I will take her! I was the one who first saw her! Shut up, shut up! You perverts! I will take her! Chloroform This is it! This is the skin! Where are you going? Ayame is in serious trouble! Ayame is together with her guest! - Let me go! - You can't go upstairs, you can't go! Help, help! Follow him! Hurry up, detain him! Hey, don't get in my way! What the hell are you doing?! Ayame! Stop it! Ayame! She is mine! You have to leave now! Ayame! Let me go! Get out! Let me go! Let me go! The courtesan is coming! Lady Jigoku, the courtesan, is here! The courtesan is coming! Lady Jigoku, the courtesan, is here! The courtesan is coming! Lady Jigoku, the courtesan, is here! The courtesan is coming! She was promoted in rank. - Should we get a tattoo as well? - No way, no way. Seikichi, the tattooist won't return here again. The courtesan is here! Lady Jigoku, the courtesan, is here! I am so glad, Miyono... oh. I mean, Lady Jigoku, congratulations. Thank you for the kind words. Lady Jigoku, the courtesan, is here! You can come out now. Miyono was promoted in rank... Nobody had ever expected that. But tell me, Kisuke, what are you worried about? If the police find out that I lent the illustrated book, it will be confiscated for sure, and I will go to prison if I get arrested. They don’t understand how precious Hokusai really is, right? Ayame, please run away with me. Where? I am sick of Japan because they don’t understand how precious Hokusai is. You see... I want to go to America with this illustrated book. How do we get on the ship? We can ride one secretly and hide inside. But how do we do it? How about that sailor you were talking about? Can you ask him to help us run away together? All right? Bob... I want to ask you a favor. O-Ayame, anything you say. Anything! I want... to ride a ship. All right, all right. Ride... a ship. In secret! A stowaway? That's all right. It'll be an interesting adventure. But then, when we arrive in America, you'll be mine! That's all right. From here... two... Two pieces of baggage? That's all right. I'll hide you in the basket. And put you in the ship's hole. After that... I'll take care of you. Me... inside... a basket. The next port where the ship will arrive is San Francisco. - From... - After that... I'll take care of you and you'll be mine! From here... two... Two pieces of baggage. I know. I know! Me... happy... You two, please keep this a secret. Yes, nobody will know. What a good girl you are. Will you do the same, Midori? Yes. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I will put the illustrated book between your clothes. Hey, what are you going to do with that vase? It's for peeing. That makes sense. Do you think this is big enough for the two of us? - Do you want to try? - No. Let’s try it after escaping from here. Hey! It's that way! The meeting point is the shrine, isn’t it? Yes. That’s what Bob told me. It must be it, no doubt. - I see. - Hey, they are here. Someone is coming. - Seikichi! - You are Kisuke, aren’t you? I am here to take Ayame with me. - You can’t have her. - Hey, beat him up. - Her body is the reward. - Thank you. You bastard! Let me go! Hold him! Don't touch her! Let me go! Stand up! Hey, you'll kill him! That was dangerous! Hey, give me a hand here! - Buddy, help yourself. - I'm going first, then. What a treat! Ayame... Ayame... Are you all right? Oh my god, she's badly hurt! Damn heavy basket! Ayame! Ayame! Yes? Where is this voice coming from? There's nobody here... Oh my! It's you, my love! Is it really you, Kisuke? Could this be my imagination? Ah, I knew it was you after all, Kisuke! You didn’t want to abandon me. So, you wanted to go to America along with me. My, you poor thing. You wanted to save me, even if you had to bleed badly, right? However, you don't have to worry now. This way, you can be with me forever. Isn't it so? It is, right? I'm so glad! I didn't know what to do, trapped in this dark place all by myself. I will not be lonely anymore because you are with me now, because we can talk like this anytime. Please protect me from now on, yes? Can you do it? Now, with that mouth of yours... kiss me as much as you want. Well, well, you're all cleaned now, huh? Thank you, Bob! At last, I came to America, yes? What's the name of this town? It's a settlement. Settlement city? Settlement, huh? It looks so much like Japan. Come, honey! What's wrong? - Does your knee still hurt? - Wait. - Wait... - Show me! What are you hiding? It's hell in itself! Help! - Bob! - Save me! Bob, wait! Kisuke... Please listen to me. I really wish you could stay with me like this until the end of time. However... people are going to run away from me whenever I am with you. If everyone runs away from me, what should I do to live in America? How will I be able to survive in a land like this? Kisuke... I beg you, can you erase yourself from my knee? In return, I'll promise you something. Even if I have to sell my body in order to survive, I will never be anyone’s wife. I promise you that. I swear you. I will never have a husband. Kisuke! Thank you! You heard my plea, haven't you? You are beautiful! Don't worry, George. I'm not worried. It's just that I feel rotten. - That's all. - Just leave everything up to me. All I want to do is help you feel free from all your anxieties. In this Yokohama settlement, we are beyond the reach of the law. No one will ever condemn you for anything you do here. Here's the place now. Come on! Please take care of him. Oh, but he's such a young and good looking lad. This is George Morgan. A very good friend of mine. He's the son of the multimillionaire. Oh, you mean the Morgan family from New York? That's right. He was diddled by a wicked woman with the usual trouble afterwards of love or death. His parents are so concerned about him that they sent him here to Yokohama for me to look after him. As you can see, he's rather depressed. Well, well. You couldn't have come to a better place. Yes, the best place. I have an exceedingly nice... A baby, she's just waiting for a visit from you. Ed, I think I better go back. George, just a minute. Wait a minute, it'll be all right. Just wait, all right? Don't worry, George. Good evening! Good evening! Good evening. Well, let me introduce my friend, George Morgan. She's Ayame, a Japanese girl, George. Hello! Hello, George. It sounds like a Japanese name. A very nice name. - Ayame. - Huh? I have something important to tell you. What that might be? You look so serious. Well, you see, I'm much healthier now. And I'm going to be leaving for the States in a few days. Ayame, will you marry me? What are you saying? - What are you...? - New York is far from here. No one will ever know what went on in Yokohama. But... But I... If you don't marry me, I'll get sick again. - This time I know I'll kill myself. - No, you can't! You must not! Then, you'll marry me, won't you? Yes... You mean it, you'll marry me? - All right. - Ah, thank you! I'll come and get you tomorrow. What's the matter? It is just... just that... I'm so happy. Good night. George! Yeah? Goodbye. See you tomorrow! George... Forgive me. George... What was that noise? Maybe a cat or a rat. What are you doing, Ayame? George! It is you, George! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why... are you here? In a place like this? Didn't I tell you? I can read your mind. I can see everything. Oh, George! I love you! I love you forever! Ayame, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, until death do you part? Yes, until death do us part. I do. Good luck, George. Have a good time. Are you happy, Ayame? Of course! Of course I am, George! Hey! From this moment on, you're my husband, and I'm your wife. It hurts! Help me, Ayame! What's wrong, George? George... Your cunt is biting my cock! You're killing me! Oh no! It's killing me! Help! Ayame, you got to help me! Kisuke! Help! Someone call a doctor! Call a doctor! Someone come and help! Help... Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh my god! Bring the priest. It's the curse of the devil! All right! All right! I'm dying... my heart... Kisuke, forgive me. I know you're upset because I didn't keep my promise and got married... I can't stand it... I can't stand... Hurry, right here. This is the room, right here! This is the room! What is going on here?! Father, an evil spirit took over my vagina! Please, Father, cast the devil spirit away. Quick! Devil, be gone. Devil, be gone! Devil, be gone! Devil, repent! You all right, Ayame? Devil, repent! Wait! Wait, Father! This spirit is not a Christian devil. It has no fear of the cross nor the bible. Ayame, there is no devil that can't contend against the cross. That's not what I meant, Father. He's angry because I've broken a promise. I will reason with him. Then, I'm certain that he will pardon me. George... Please wait in the bathroom. Will you be all right, Ayame? Yes, I'll be all right. Please, leave this to me. Now, hurry! Come, my son. Kisuke. You are the one I love the most. I'm certain we will be a married couple in the future. However, if you become a devil, we cannot meet each other at all. That makes me so sad. After I separate from George, when I finally die, I will marry you, Kisuke. So, will you wait for me until the day I die? Will you? Thank you! You understood me, haven't you? Kisuke... A miracle! George, come here! The ordeal is over. Are you all right, Ayame? George, I'm all right. Thank you very much, Kisuke! Forget the sadness and doze Fold your wings and come to my chest The town is cold My heart freezes like a fossil in the darkness Only the two of us are here now, make the time stop For the sake of these memories during this beautiful night When you look at me, I can see the color of your eyes I will only look at you forever Only the two of us are here now, make the time stop For the sake of these memories during this beautiful night The morning will come soon And you will go on a trip to the sky, leaving me behind Directed by: Tetsuji Takechi THE END
