-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- - This has to stop. Where are your friends when you need them? Oh, hi, Sandy. So good to hear from you. Oh, you're doing good? Great. Your new house is fine? Your husband's there? You're expecting, wow. I'm so happy for you. However did you find time to call me? I don't know. Me? I'm doing just great. You know, besides Pete dying on some battlefield somewhere and then his body going missing. Everything's rosy. It's just great. I'm so glad you bothered to call, to ask. To... I've never waited so long for a single phone call in my life. Not even when I met Pete and waited for his first call. Dead soldier bodies have been disappearing from army morgues for two years now. My husband was one of them. I'd been contacted by someone on the inside. Someone who'd also found out what had been going on. Every night for the past two weeks, it's been like this and every night has ended the same way. No answer. By about 10, I've had enough and I open the bottle of gin. Then, by 11, I've given up looking at the phone. After that, I don't remember anything. Shit. Hello? - Diane? - Yes, it's me. Did you find anything? - I've come across some significant information for you. - You have, what? - This is highly classified, very secret. I found a possible location for those shipping numbers you've been chasing. - Really? - They've been secretly shipped from all abouts to even the countryside. - Go on. - Well, I've mentioned numbers, shipping dates, eh, hold on. This connection isn't safe, let me text you a sat nav coordinate. You can drive there tonight. I'll give you a call in exactly 40 minutes. - Okay, uh, will I... Okay. Where are you? - Exercise to begin in two hours. - I still remember the first time we met. I saw you across the room at Sandy's party. And then you saw me. You always said that was the moment you knew. What is it about doubts? You get something you want and then, suddenly, you start to doubt things. Maybe it was because it's the middle of the night. I'm in the middle of nowhere, I'm following the advice of someone I've never met and the forest is pitch black. I'd been given an opportunity and I had to strike whilst it was hot. These things don't come around often and I'd spent long enough sitting by myself drinking and crying myself to sleep every night. Okay, I'm here. So hurry up and ring. We don't know what awaits us in the darkness. The future is in darkness. Our lives, our fates, our destinies, all in darkness. That's why we fear it. Shit! Hello? - Are you there? - Yes, I am. Wherever here is. Where am I supposed to be going? - All right, this is very important. - What's that? - To make sure that no one sees you and you are not being followed. - Okay. - Now give me the coordinates. - What is this place? - I don't know. I only have a small leaked document which mentioned the consignment order and an address. - And that's it? - It matches up and that's all that matters. - And how old is the document? - Unknown. Two, maybe three years old. - And the missing bodies are there? - I don't know. It's only just confirmed that they were shipped there. It's strange because this place is abandoned. - Okay, um, give me the address. - Now, the barracks has been abandoned for a couple of years. They have it listed as derelict. I'm gonna send you to the one private road which allows access to the site. Do not let anyone see you or follow you there. It is top secret and private government ground. - What do you think I'll find there? - Hopefully what you're looking for. Did you manage to get the facial recognition app I sent you working? - Yes. Are you sure it's going to be able to identify a body? - It scans facial shape and bone structure. It's got a 98% match rate and a very clever piece of technology. - Okay, thanks. I still don't know who you are. - Maybe that's for the best. - I don't know, is it? - It doesn't matter either way, does it? - No, I suppose it doesn't. - Let's just say I'm someone with a score to settle. - So, I guess this is where you sign off and I start then, right? - I'm afraid so. I've done everything I can. And you're on your own from here on. - Don't worry, I'm used to that. - I wish you luck, I really do. - Thank you. Are you gonna come and save me if it all goes wrong? I didn't think so. - You'll do just fine. Now, here's the coordinates. - The woods kept getting darker and the road kept getting narrower. Where was this leading? I knew where it was taking me. It was taking me to the darkest and most foulest place imaginable. I wasn't gonna get off easy. This whole thing felt like hell. And hell was where I was headed. That's where the answers were gonna be. There had been many a night when it seemed like all hope was lost and I'd wanted to give up. Many dark nights when I'd lie awake and thoughts would pass through my mind. Thoughts I'd rather not remember. Nights that I'd like to forget. This is why they were so hard to find. I could tell that someone didn't want them found. Okay, let's go. Consignment Number 1138. Shipping in numbered crates. Jesus Christ. Look, it's you. Look. It's you. You are Corporal Michael Reece. British Specialized Service. Age 32. Born Surry, 9th of June 1985. You are married to Angela Reece, with a son, Mark. You were killed in action on the 5th of March 2014. Your body went missing a week later. How did you get here? - Who am I? - You are Corporal Michael Reece. British Specialized Service. Born Surry, 9th of June 1985. Specimen Delta, code 19, do you copy? Specimen Delta, code 19, do you copy? - Why am I here? - I don't know. I have no idea what they've done to you. I have to get out of here. You want the pictures? He was definitely Corporal Reece. The facial recognition had figured that out. But Corporal Reece was dead. He'd been shot and killed two years ago. Confirmed dead. Now, here he was. Standing three feet in front of me, on his own two feet. The literal walking dead. - Mirror. Why? - I don't know. I don't know why you're here or what they did. But I've been searching for you. I've been searching for lots of missing soldiers. Soldiers who had families. Families like me. Like my husband. He was a soldier, same as you. Why are there other dead soldiers outside? Why are you shooting them? - Orders. - Orders? - Training. Live targets. - They're soldiers too, just like you! What is this place? Do you remember this place? - Tests done here. - They did tests on you in here? What kind of tests? - Tests. I don't know what. Just remember. Pain. - What else do you remember, Corporal? What else? He could remember what they'd done to him. But was he alive or dead? I didn't really know. I don't think he knew. But he'd suddenly remembered. Like his memory had come back from a far away place. Maybe seeing his photo or his family had been the trigger. Whatever had triggered his memory had also triggered other things. Questions. He was full of them. "Who am I? "Why am I here? "Why do I feel?" Sadness, pain, maybe even love. He suddenly felt. He felt what it was to be alive. Whatever that was. Don't shoot. - Who are you? - Specimen Delta? Number four? Oh, I found you. - What's going on here? - Step away, girl. Come over here. - Why? - Because he's a killing machine. Highly lethal. So why hasn't he killed you then? - He's a missing dead soldier, British Army. - That's right. Almost unstoppable. Pure instinct. - And the others outside? - Oh, they're cannon fodder. They're the ones that didn't make the cut, so to speak. - Well, I've been looking for them. They went missing. My husband too. He's one of the dead soldiers who disappeared two years ago. - Number Four? - His name is Michael Reece. - Michael Reece? - Corporal Michael Reece. - Okay, I can see that there's something very, very wrong here. Who are you and how did you get in here? - What have you done to him? Why is he like this? - Listen to me, girl. Okay, you don't have the slightest fucking clue about what's going on around here. He is lethal, deadly, and we are in serious breach of security protocol. - He's not gonna hurt us. - You have no idea. - He remembers who he was, he knows. - No. You are not aware, are you? Delta? Delta Four? - He knows he is Michael Reece. He remembers himself and his family. - He shouldn't remember anything. - Why's that? - Because he's just reanimated flesh. He can have no memory before that point. This Corporal Reece of yours is dead. Gone to heaven. - Well, he does, he's alive. - Impossible. I reanimated him myself. Now. I suggest you come with me and we get him back into tonight's program. - I want to know where the others are. - This is top secret military and government business. If you're lucky, you'll get five years just for breaking in here tonight. - I don't care what you think! I want to find out what happened to my husband's body and the rest of the missing soldiers. - Sorry. We don't keep track of names or anything. He's just a dead body, medical research. - Fuck you. - Specimen Delta. You are ordered to stand down. Code 94, repeat, code 94. - What are you doing? - Specimen Delta, stand down, code 94. - Get off! - Keep still. - Corporal, your name is Michael Reece, remember. - Shut up. - Corporal, you do not have to follow his orders. You are not Delta Four, you are Michael Reece, remember. - Shut up! You think he'll listen to you, eh? He only knows commands. Delta Four, put the weapon down. Repeat, drop the weapon, code 94! - Corporal Michael Reece, remember the photo. Your wife, your family. - Do you think anyone will ever find you here? Do you? - Corporal, remember your family, your son! Remember the picture! - Shut your mouth! One more word out of you and I'll... - Reece, please! - Shut it! Reece, help me. Where are the other bodies? Where are they? Where are they?! - It's too late. It's too late, just, just let it be. - Tell me now. - It's too top secret, I can't... - Tell me! - Okay. Okay, they're in, they're in a fenced off paddock. It's on the other side of the woods. - Don't lie to me! - I'm not, it's the truth, it's the truth. Just, just, just don't kill me. - I won't. I'm not gonna kill you. - Don't kill me. - Listen. I'm not going to. - No more Delta. - Specimen Delta, code 19, do you read me? Specimen Delta, this is a recall. Specimen Delta, code 19, do you copy? No answer. Fire Dragon Two, this is team leader. I think we have a code red. Specimen missing, do you copy? Not tonight. - What are you doing? - End. - I can't do that, I... - End. - I can't. I can't. I'm just here to find my husband and the other missing soldiers. You can help me. You can help the others like you. And we can put a stop to whoever's doing this. - Photo, family. Please. Let my family bury me properly. - I'll make sure they do. It's long overdue. What do you remember from before? They just used you, right, and didn't tell you anything? So you didn't even know? I don't know what you feel, but I know you feel something. - I feel pain. Here. - I know. So do I. Can you take me to the fenced off paddock? We need to find the others now. - Code Seven, come in. - Code Seven, proceed. - We are ready to receive your test results. Are you ready to transfer? - Negative. We have a specimen unaccounted for at this time. Training session is incomplete. - Roger, Code Seven. What's the problem? - Unknown at this time. Just a missing specimen and missing crew member. - Is there a control problem? We've been noticing slight behavior pattern problems with the latest reanimated specimens. - What problems? - Ticks, sir. - Ticks? What ticks? - Just recently, there have been changes in behavior which we've been unable to figure out. - What have they been doing? - Well, there's been slight signs of memories from them. - What kind of memories? - Just flashes it seems. And they've been questioning it. - No way. Their brains can't hold memories from before reanimation. - Well, somehow, they have been. It sounds impossible, I know. But they might have a spark of life in them. This reanimated state, did set for the jumpstart. Now they've evolved. - Well, for whatever reason, we've noticed these ticks, these flashes of life for a lack of a better word, it seems that by bringing the body back to life, you also bring their thoughts back. - Bullshit. They've been long gone to heaven. - Did you know one of them spoke the other day? - What did it say? - It said, "Take me back." - It said that? What did it mean by that? - We don't know. It seemed a significant theme for. Do you have any special instructions for us? - Look into it. - Will do. Do you think there's any connection with this and your specimen tonight? - No, no, it's just a glitch. - Okay, commander. We'll keep an eye on these ticks. Send over a report for you. - Yes, right away. I need to see what these bastards are doing. If need be, we'll make adjustments to the reanimation process and, Doctor, these specimens will continue with their duties regardless of any ticks or glitches. I believe that dead is dead and these soldiers are definitely that. Over. - Copy you, Code Seven. - Dead. - Something is wrong. - What? What's wrong? - Mobile One, we've lost visual target, over. - Alpha Chain, we have you on infrared. No sign of target, over. - No visual on target, Mobile One. Can you check satellite? - Negative. Repeat, negative. Alpha Chain, I have a visual target coming up on your right, over. - Where, Mobile One? - Alpha, target is moving slowly, 20 feet to your right. - Roger that, Mobile One. Going in. Is the target still in the same place? - To your right, getting closer. Getting closer. Getting closer. Getting closer. And bingo! - Where is he, Mobile One? - Target's in front. Repeat, in front. - Shit, hold it, it's a walker. - Shot through the head. Execution style. Looks like Specimen Delta wasn't too happy with the doctor. - Copy you, Code Seven. What should we do? Should we start shutting down? - No. Negative, Code Nine. We can't afford to do that tonight. We will continue with things and keep a lid on it as much as we can. We need to find the intruder. This girl, stop her. Then we can try and figure out what the fuck she's done to Delta. But we do not stop the session. How many men you got there? - Six, sir, but we can call more in. - How long will it take? - Three hours, sir. - Shit! We can't wait that long. Well, send whoever you can spare into paddocks one and two. And I'll check number three. - Yes, sir. - I'll stay with Specimen Omega. You keep a close guard of all the equipment and don't let anyone see a thing. Get somebody to come and get Craybrick's body. Keep your eyes open. - Yes, sir. - Fucking security breach! Out here in the middle of nowhere. No one even knew we were here. - We've been trying to track this one down. - It's come from inside. - You think that? - Five years ago, I was working on an operation that got exposed. With the dead bodies for decoys project. Simple stuff compared to this but the research led right to this. Of course, they shut it down and buried it. We lost two years' work and an eight million pound budget. - I remember it, sir. - One person said something to the wrong person and it got out. I could've killed that guy. He crossed me and got away with it. He wanted to settle the score. Cost me my promotion, my new house, pension, the whole lot. - It was Agent Dunlan, sir. - If this girl is alone, one person. I won't hesitate to kill this girl to protect this operation. Not for one second. - Army. - Let's get a move on. - Code Seven, come in, what's going on down there? - As you are aware, we are experiencing a slight problem tonight with a specimen and an intruder into our field of operation. We are confident we shall be shutting down this problem before the morning. - You've got a 10 million pound biological weapon on the loose and a civilian intruder who may have let this story out. This thing can go ballistic. - Yeah, we are trying... - Do you realize what would happen if anyone finds out about this and the moral implications? - Sir, I need to... - You've got one hour before we do a shutdown and a cleanup job. - What? - One hour. You've got a civilian on the loose, God knows what they've sent or reported. If this thing ever gets out, we're all fucked. Don't you realized that? The defense secretary's kicking my ass over this. - You are not shutting me down. Do you know how many secret missions we've pulled off with these troops? - All we care about is the security of this program. The military will be held accountable for all this should there be a breach. If there is a breach there tonight, we would then tactically strike the site, destroy all the evidence, and deny everything. That's the rules, now fix it. - Shit! Okay. Code 13. If anybody finds this girl, you bring her straight to me. That's a direct order. There's no way they're shutting me down, no way. I'm not gonna let that happen. - Code Nine, we request a full debriefing on operation Sniper Corpse. The program has no official record, no history, no files. It's a big, black project and we are unsure what its status is. - We can confirm its status is ongoing. The program has met with moderate success. - We've been relayed of reports of operations completed through all parts of the world in relation to this. - Yes, sir. - And we have no reason for concern over this program? - The program has not been without its glitches, sir. The reanimated specimens have shown worrying signs. - What have they done? - The specimens have shown signs of memory. Of feelings, of forgotten emotions. - What causes this? - It seems to be triggered by something. Some memory or reminder, something. - What's the trigger? - We don't know, sir. It seems to be something uniquely personal to each of the specimens. - I was told these were dead corpses, dead to the world. They were merely being charged up with a lighter fluid mixed with electricity. That they were merely dead puppets of sorts. - Yes, sir, they are. It seems that some spark of consciousness has remained. If it hasn't remained, it's come back. - What is this form of consciousness? - We don't know, but it some kind of sign of life after death or a sign that the soul can be pulled back from death. - Is that possible? - We didn't believe it ourselves. These dead bodies, they're not just walking flesh which we planned for them to be. They've come back from wherever they went when they died. I don't see think this is a very safe area to be dealing with. Some things are better off dead. - What is it, Corporal, what is it? Corporal? - How did I die? They're getting closer! - How did I die? - You died 5th of March, 2014. - How? - You died in battle. - How? - You were shot. That's all the information there is. - I remember. - Remember what? - I remember the pain. - Okay, but we have to move, they're getting closer! - Then I went away. - What? - Somewhere. I went somewhere. - We have to move! Come on! - But then I was pulled back. - Come on, they're getting closer! Come on! - I want to go back to where I was before. Before I was pulled back. - Where were you before? Corporal? Where were you before? I wondered what he meant when he said he wanted to go back. Where was it he'd been? He never said what the place was. Only that he wanted to go back there. - 30 minutes. Shit! - Code Nine, come in. Code Nine. This is just a precaution, Code Nine, with regards to the security leak over at nest five. If the intruder evades our capture for another 30 minutes, we're assuming a leak with sensitive information has been disclosed and we have a shutdown procedure in place. - Yes, sir. - We are awaiting confirmation from Commander Braddock. - Is this it? Is this the paddock? It's empty! We have to go back. - Keep back. - Who is that? - Get back. Remember your promise. Let my family bury me. - Oh my God. Pete? It can't be. It can't! It can't be. - Gotcha! - No! No! No! - Good work, Omega. Come on! Let's get a look at you. I don't know you. You're not the traitor. Why are you so upset about a dead body? He was dead to begin with. - He wasn't dead, he was alive! - He was a walking meatloaf. - He was alive! He remembered he was a soldier. - Bullshit! - He was back. - He was back all right. Back in the grave. Come on! Down! Stay there. Code Seven here. I can confirm that I have the security breach under control. Copy? - Is that a definite, Code Seven? - Affirmative. Fucking damn right it is. Who are you? How did you find this place? Where did you get your information from? How did you find out about this place? Does anyone else know about this?! I need some answers. There's a rat here. - Who gave you the right? - What? - Who gave you the right to do this? - You better start giving me some answers. - Go to hell. - That's exactly where you're going. - I've already been there. - You can say hi to your friend outside. - Fuck you. - Oh, so you don't agree with our project here? - Not when it involves stealing dead soldiers' bodies and lying to their families. Not to mention bringing them back to life. - Not exactly, darling. Technically, they're still dead. - They're not dead, they're alive. - They're dead. They're just dead flesh, reanimated. - You're wrong. Whatever life you've brought back, you've brought back something else, too. They're alive, they remember. Pete, it's me, it's Diane! - You think you know him? Omega? - He's my husband. - Your what? - Pete, it's me, it's Diane, do you remember? - So this why you came here. You're related to one of these bastards. Well, you're wasting your time. He follows orders. Just like all the rest. He's meat. Just a dead lump of meat. - Pete, remember, it's me, it's Diane. - He doesn't remember. Nor does he remember anything. He just follows orders. - He will. - He won't remember you nor recognize you. He's pure electrified motor function. - They do remember. Corporal Reece spoke. He remembered. He felt, he was alive. - Dead is dead. Now. Give me a name. Just to make things a little fairer. Now. Who sent you? Who was the bastard who gave you this information? - Pete, look, it's us, when we met, remember? - Who was it who told you about this place? I want to know. - Pete, please, remember who you are. Pete, please, help me! - Who sent you? - Pete, please. Pete, it's me, it's your wife, Diane Keeley, do you remember? Pete, please, remember who you are! - Forget it, love. Give me a name. - Pete, that picture was taken the night that we met. You always said it was our most special moment, do you remember? - I'm sorry to disappoint you. He may be your husband, but he's nothing but a hunk of dead meat. If you won't talk, you're not much use to me. Okay. It's over. Omega! Code 94, Omega, code 94! Code 94, Omega, stand down, stand down! Omega! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! - Oh, God, Pete. I can't believe it's you. We have to get you out of here. No. No, what are you doing? No, Pete, we... No, Pete, we... Goodbye. It's not easy coming here knowing they are gone. After all we went through, there's at least one thing I do know and I know this for sure. They're in a better place now.
