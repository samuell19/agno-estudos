Mom. Where's Dad? Sorry, Shin. Dad's working today. Lately I haven't seen, Dad. Dad is currently researching something important. So we can't see dad often. It's okay, there's still mom. Thank you, Shin. Okay, Today's dinner is your choice. Yay! In that case .... Mom? Mom ?! I don't really understand, but lately it seems dangerous. It looks like a bad sign. It seems there is also something that says war will happen. Like a sign of the end of the world? I guess so. Good morning, Shin. Kotori. Is your dad home yet? This morning he didn't come home. It's been three days already .... Like the dark industry. Want to tell my dad? It's okay. My dad likes his job, so he won't come home. Why are you alone? How about staying at my house today? Woah, Kotori! Even though it's still morning, it's just attacking .... Eh? I-It's not like that! We're just childhood friends! Yes yes. Good morning. Morning! Morning! If you have a problem, let me know? Yes. Get away. Yes. These days, they are always together, right? Heh, you have a crush on Kotori? No. I think Kotori is difficult to be conquered. I say I don't have a crush. Izumi's company, The Kotori family is twisted, yes. His father Hazama worked there, surely his family relations were also good. Ms. Hazama has died, right? His death was abrupt, he said. Really? Lately many have been like that, right? What is the cause? It must be due to a virus. I like things that smell like aliens. Huh? Sorry, called for you. What do you want to talk about? Izumi-san, do you currently have a boyfriend? Eh? I don't think so. If so, how about going out with me? You said you didn't have a crush on him ... I still don't want to date. Do you hate me? Not that I hate you. If so, isn't far different from liking, right? Huh? It's not like that either. Well, just do it first! From there we just think about the next step. Wait! Huh? Huh? Just stop it. Shin? Why did you appear instead? I just happened to hear it. Don't bother me! But Kotori, I don't think you have any feelings. Huh ?! Tch. What the heck are you doing. Yes, never mind. Boring. I'll keep this a secret! We must also return soon. Eh? Ah! Yes. Shin ?! Let's go home together? For today, thank you, for helping me. No problem. Also, why did you reject it? Huh? He is famous. The thing is he is the captain of volleyball extracurricular. His face is handsome, his brain was also quite runny. That's because ... The thing is ... Besides, why could he say that? What the heck? You're graduating soon. Well, before that there is an entrance examination first. Is it okay if we both keep this up? So what? Ouch. Hurry up and be sensitive. I can't keep on waiting. Kotori, For tomorrow, would you like to go on a date? Hmm. I-Good! Papa. Shin. I'm sorry. Lately, my father has been unable to go home. It's fine. Sorry. I will go back to work. I don't have time. Do as you wish. Shin. Papa. What did he do anyway? Oh my god ... Shin! Kotori? Sorry, it's been a long time? Not really. I just came. What the heck? Please advise ... ... to accompany me today! Then, shall we go? Yes! Kotori! Yes? I ... My feelings for you ... Ah, Sorry. Wait a minute please. This is from my father. Hello? Yes. I was with him. Yes. Eh? Are you lying? Yes. I understand. I will say. It's fine. Well then. See you later. What's up? Shin! Calm down and listen. I am your leader, Kotoko! Everything, keep praying for us. Keep loving us. That loyalty, we will never forget. A sudden death. He is constantly researching, right? Maybe he is tired. His wife also died first, right? Then what about the child? Shin. Uncle. About Mr. Genji, because lately he couldn't go home, I'm really sorry. No. That's because of the father's will. On the contrary, I'm sorry for being such a hassle. That's not true. His research ... ... can save many people. Saving? He could not save anyone. Good mother, and himself. Next time we talk again. For daily use, you don't need to worry. Miko and Riko were ready to be sent to Tokyo. Good work. I thank you for your cooperation. Unnecessary words. Well then, I'll start. Repair this Japanese. I will change this Japan! During the time of the second world war, in Japan there is a hidden laboratory. His research ended in failure. Therefore, there was a strange event, The world became two. These two worlds each have the same person. Their lives are connected. If one of them dies, then the other one dies. That is not yet known by the two worlds. The two Japanese wrote their own history. The first, Japan, which has forgotten the war. And the other one, wars that continue to take place in Japan. In this world, deaths continue. If ... ... people who were in the country found our country. The two countries of Japan will inevitably conflict. Your future is determined here. Think about it carefully. Excuse me. What were you talking about in the counseling room? I will not go to college and will go straight to work. Eh? Why? Because there is no money. I will be independent and work right away. How about discussing it with my father? No need. I don't want to bother anymore. Your father wants you to go to college, right? That doesn't have anything to do anymore, right? I don't want to be like him. I don't really understand, but ... He is a great researcher, right? But he died without producing anything. Don't say that. See you later. Hey! About college ... ... we better talk about it with my father, huh? There's no need. Yes. Rely on me, you fool. This area ... Found you. You ... ... who? I'm Jin. I will protect you. Let's run. Oi! Just run. What is that? Eh? Has anyone been hit? We better call the police. What is that? Huh? Found you. You ... ... who? My name is Miko. You ... ... will be protected by Miko. You ... That is ... That face of yours ... ... same as you. Eh? Well, that is indeed surprising. I am you. Huh? I was called to this world, who came from the other world. Originating from the other world? Miko is a person from that country of Japan, that Miss Kotoko called for planning this project, Matic is a historic human robot weapon. Eh? Heh .... That's great ... By the way, is the road really going this way? We have been walking for a long time. We suspect that the Shin Miss Kotori knew, are around here. Yes, but please don't use 'Miss'. I understand, Kotori. First name ?! Whatever ... Is Shin alright? I've been listening, It seems like you are worried about the person named Shin. Huh? Yes. I'm worried about him ... For Kotori, what does Shin's whereabouts mean to you? What should I do ?! Only limited to childhood friends. That Shin, when he lost his mother, he was very sad, and do not discuss it with anyone. At that time I felt that I should always accompany him. Shin is a little strange. He did not have many friends. If there were no me, maybe it would be worse. Ah, but he has many good sides. He was always smart, always he also received high ranking, that part of him that makes me feel he's cool. I understand. Do you understand what? I see. Wait! My life and you are connected. If you die, I will die too. If I die, you die. What is that? This is the law of the two worlds. Your family who suddenly died, is proof of that law. Life taken from another world, then in the other world ... ... his life had to be taken away, Forced? My parents were killed by them. You .... What do you mean? Technology that moves two worlds, The human-shaped robot weapon ... ... are my parents' findings. To seize that technology, they killed mother. Furthermore, my father was also killed. I ... I'm here to kill another Kotoko figure. 'Kill him'? Hey, I don't understand at all. I want to go home. Wow! Wait. If you come out now, it will be dangerous. Is he really in a place like this? You should have. If I'm not mistaken, you ... You just said the enemy, right? Maybe he just rebelled because he didn't want to go home. That's right. If said to be rebellious, then that is true. What the heck are you doing, Shin ... As expected, it's better to call the police. Uh, what are you doing? It's open. Huh? Can I come in? Then, let's go. W-Wait, that's dangerous ... Ah. Gosh ... Here you are. Wow! Why did he leave first ... Gosh, it's getting dark ... Turns out he was there. Wow .... Don't leave first. The problem here is dangerous. Eh? Miko? Don't come here. Miko? No ... He is ... Princess in this world. Why is he here? Don't tell me, Is he with the Fixer? No. If that is true, he is too weak. So, he just followed it. What are you talking about? It's possible! The princesses in this world should know nothing. If it's true like that , I can win! Oi, you! Kotori? I will kill I will kill the princess! The princess ... ... you mean Kotori? Move! No. Please stop. Anyone, help me. Wow! Damn it. Miko? Shin! Kotori! What is this place? Miko? I see ... We are ... I will protect Shin! Kotori! No way! Shin! Kotori? Turns out you've done a 'Fix' ?! Don't! Shin, are you alright ?! Yes. I will take you home. Uh, wait ...! Wow! Shin, hurry up! Why, He didn't kill me? Even though in the other world I am called the Princess, I still don't quite understand. Suddenly life is in danger. As unreal. Oh. But, because there is a Miko protecting, will we be all right? Oh. This girl, temporarily stay with me. He might not get caught if I hid him in my room. My parents are rarely at home. Hey, how about you also stay at my house? The problem is danger. No. No need, dad will go home- Shin. See you later. I ... ... completely helpless. Every now and then ... ... count on me, you fool. Miko's fixer can't be felt. Don't you say you were defeated? Miko! I finished it. Ms. Kotoko I put the towel here. OK! Really, you don't have a problem if you don't go home? Yes. Earlier I contacted my mother. My father also said "fight, make it smooth"! What does "fight" mean? Maybe it's already late, but ... You're a robot, aren't you, Miko? Is it okay if you get into the water? Yes, Miko is waterproof! And also my nature is not a robot, but I'm a sophisticated weapon called Matic. I see. Hey. Why did you fix it with me? As a result of the alma attack earlier, Our opposing worlds become connected, and Fix's relationship with Miss Kotoko was broken, then suddenly turned to Kotori. Because that's what became my fixer now is Kotori. My brain gets confused. Too many things happen suddenly. Even though I just wanted to always be with Shin. Don't say it out loud. Because it's embarrassing. Kotori's feelings are connected to my feelings. Well then, let's match it one more time. In the Japanese kingdom, Kotoko is the leader. Jin wants to kill Kotoko's figure, because in the parallel world he continued to be protected, So he could not approach it. Then he sought ... ... the figure of Kotoko in this world. Because killing Kotori is very easy. But even Kotoko in the world noticed it, he also sent Miko to protect him. I see. Easy explanation for me. However, the problem starts from here. Try looking at this. This is news of recent events. Cases of indiscriminate murder. Miko! Are there also faces of important people in Japan there? All of these were members of the Japanese royal council. Council? People who assisted Ms. Kotoko in running her government. Is this artificial? I don't know ... However, from the state of his body it felt full of irregularities. Like being mutated using a sharp knife. Sharp knife .... What is clear is that there is no denying that the other world is involved. Yes, that's right. Oi, Kotori! When you talk, don't sleep. I know that you are tired. Heh, I still can. As long as I can stay ... Come on, sleep. Miko! Do you know anything else- Miko, just wait here. Please take care of Kotori. Yes? Were you there? What's up? Don't be so careful. I brought you all the items that I left behind. Right now I am not targeting you guys. I want to talk for a minute. Here. Yes. I just want to protect Shin. I see. Is that why you didn't aim for me? If I die, you will die too ... Thanks to this, my life is no longer a target. Anyway, now Miko is won't target your life anymore. Therefore you should not never touch Kotori again. Sorry, yes. Only he wants me to kill. Only him? Hey. You ... Huh? Aren't you the one who killed councilors? Council? All I seek is the princess. If so, Who? Shin! Found you. Who is he? As I thought, you come here, Riko. Ma'am Miko, it turns out you're fine. Yes. The situation has changed. I'll explain, so please lower your weapon. I understand. Ma'am Miko. What happened? I have something I want to talk to you too. Liberating the Country? Yes, that is the aim of Miss Kotoko. Isn't he the one who restrains his own country? He even executed my father. Your father's execution was determined by a member of the council. Huh? Ms. Kotoko's heart also felt hurt. What do you mean? There are council interests behind it. What do you mean by that? Isn't the princess in control of the council ?! There was no attempt for Ms. Kotoko. The person who leads, was coercion from the council, and fully complied with the decisions of the board members. Rebels will be sentenced to death. In that case, it is similar to .... Princess is just a doll ?! To stop the riots due to the actions of the council ... ... in secret he made the Miko, and sent it to this world. So that's the story. Meaning who executed those people, turned out to be Riko. Jin, our goal is is roughly the same as you. Impossible. The real Kotori, doesn't mean to be after you. Because of this, can you not target Kotori anymore? If that is the case, Riko also doesn't need to target you anymore. Jinn. I also request that from you. Even for me, Kotori is ... Ah, alright! I understand. Ceasefire! Thank you very much. Continue to the recent conflict for what purpose ?! Gosh, bye. I didn't think you could stop the Jinn that way. Interestingly, that Miko. No. What's interesting is my other self. Thank God. This is Shin's house, yes. Where are Shin and Miko? Eng ... What kind of situation is this? Good morning. Good morning, Kotori. It was just right, the situation was now peaceful. Huh? Who? Yeah. Look, I'm sorry. When I fall asleep, it happens like that, huh? Miko, thank you. This is Kotori's wish. Is that so? What are you going to do from now on? Although the agreement has reached the final stage, but there are still people to be eliminated, to complete the project. I am the same. If the people in black robes that is the council ... ... then I will target them. Do you still want to kill? If it stops here, everything will be in vain. Oh yeah, What if we play together now, shall we? Huh? While it's off. The weather is also good. We all go somewhere? You are interested in this world, right? There is no time to do that- I am interested in food in this world. I agree. Even though I thought all of the things here were tasteless. This is pretty ... Anyway, my initial agenda was to attack you. So, based on my agenda, the change is no problem. Okay, that means it's been decided! Yes. How does your body process food? Don't worry. Our food came out of the right place. At this rate, they are like normal children, huh ... Yes. Kotori really understands is our condition right now? It turned out that Kotori was thinking too much. Although sometimes he acts stupid. That is a characteristic that is often used by women in this world. What is that? Whether it's a princess, or even Kotori. I don't really understand women. Ms. Kotoko is a woman who is easily understood. Maybe it's almost like you. I'm sure the story will go well. If we have returned to the world there, can we meet again? Ms. Kotoko also hopes so. If you have the intention ... If we are in the only other world, will Shin and I fight each other? I don't know. But, in the end Jin and Kotoko, Thanks to this incident, their relationship changed. I don't know what will happen from now on. It's true. They might also be suitable. And it could be that they later fell in love. And it would be better if they were married. That's ... Does that mean our relationship will be like that? Huh? What do you mean? Kotori! Hm? I ... My feelings for you ... Ms. Kotoko! Ms. Kotoko ...! What's up? What happened? Kotori. I'm sorry. Looks like Miko ... ... cannot protect you. Huh? The agreement has failed. Failed? So that's how it is ... Because of Kotoko huh? Kotori? Shin. It is impossible. Sorry, yes. It seems that I will die soon. Turns out that was your action. Kotoko, did you come to the end Your bodyguard has told us everything. In order to protect our cause, we must destroy you. Kotori. Shin will definitely be fine. Miko will definitely protect you. What are you talking about ?! I cannot be with you. Kotori. I ... How about this ?! I'm afraid. Shin ... Help me! Kotori! It's time ... We must immediately find a replacement. His successor ... He is ... Are Kotoko's dolls left behind? It was just right. Let's use him. Kotori! Kotori! Oi! Kotori! Get up, Kotori! Kotori! I ... ... could not save Kotori. I am your leader, Riko. Yesterday, the previous Chairman, Kotoko was executed. Ladies and gentlemen ... Pray to us. Please love us. Your loyalty, forever we will never forget. They are ... Is it trustworthy? Here ... ... is where my father works. You are ... Uncle. Sorry for forcing you to come here. Shin. You guys ... Can we talk? Regarding something that happened to you. Yes. This is really real according to what Jin said. We think this is alma. This is all we know. Thank you for discussing it, Jin. Then, what is your goal after this? That's right. The fact is that my daughter was killed by their side. Only that is clear. Immediately build countermeasures. In order to resolve the conflict with the other Japan, we need to prepare countermeasures. Understood. Sorry, yes. Maybe we need cooperation from you. It turned out that his body was quite attractive. Like reflecting who we are. What an ideal body. Very good, Riko. The level of technology in your country of Japan is astonishing. Can this really be fixed? Well, take it easy. Our technology is also not nuts. Besides that ... ... things were even more difficult there. If the partner does not want to, then the fixer relationship will not occur. For the correct process to occur ... ... his partner must accept the trigger given to him. However, for the moment it is still not ... Matic might become the real power of the country of Japan. Chances are ... ... their partners must also be at the forefront. Does this mean that it depends on itself? Intelligent unmanned weapons ... ... named Almatic has been prepared. And the preparations that had been made previously ie to attack the Japanese government, had also been settled. Now, do we have to start the party now? The new army, ALMATIC, does not care about lives. That is, do not fear death! In just a moment ... ... we will burn down The other Japan! What the heck is that ?! Maybe he was cosplaying. Poto, ah. Run! Everyone, run! Residents ... Don't tell me ...?! We don't have time? Everything has been targeted. Can we fight it? Eh what is this? Living corpse? That's not it. Was there an attack in Shinjuku City? What should I do ?! He said, there were many fatalities! Maybe this country has finished its history. Do people still live there ?! I can't hear anyone's voice! All I have left is me, oh no! Damn it! Did it work? What exactly is that? Geez, he doesn't want to hear. There is news from the Bureaucrats. Alright, please connect. It's me. What? Minister of the Interior, Principal Secretary, Cabinet Secretary, Minister of Defense. Secretary of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, Coordinating Minister for Political and Economic Law Minister of Transportation, Minister of the Environment. Minister of the Interior. Stop it! Why the heck am I? Minister of Economy, Minister of Trade Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Forestry, Minister of Health I'm not the prime minister! Minister of Foreign Affairs. The eradication of all ministers and the Prime Minister has been completed. The eradication of all relatives of the minister and the prime minister has been completed. That's not ... possible! The government is dead. Using connected lives! How horrifying! As if we would be silent seeing things like this ?! Annihilation of the Japanese government was completed according to plan. OK. There was also territorial territory of the Japanese empire. Get rid of all the bullies! Please remove them. Get up. Come on! I'll buy time. Make sure you come! Thank you for the warm greetings. Difficult circumstances! I want to protect you, Shin. Me too wants to protect you, Kotori. Yes. It's ... impossible. Because there is you, I'm not lost. Even at my father's death ... ... and my mother's death ... A world without you ... ... can't be ... Don't give up. Because of you it's still here I want to protect the world you belong to. Therefore, do not give up. I protect you. I don't want you to give up. Yes, I will protect it! Kotori! I ... ... will not give up! This is bad! Sorry for the long time! You're late! Woke ...! Let's get started! Good! Miko! The enemy's reaction is gone! Okay, you can do it! Yo. It worked too. Yes. Almatic that we have sent is experiencing a lot of disturbances. They don't seem to understand their position. Mobilize the weapons of genocide from this world. Eh? Good! Wow. What's up? Are you OK? Don't say ... Emergency situation report! What's going on ?! A very big explosion. Estimates of the mortality rate have emerged. Two hundred thousand. No, there are three hundred thousand. Based on information that has been compiled, Tokyo has ... Mass death. It is likely that in their world there was also a big incident. Do they mean to dump their own world? This is from the Bureaucrat. Yes. I see. Yes, they are working with us. Understood. We are back. Things have changed. In this way, it's as if the population of the whole country is being held hostage. By committing such heinous acts by the Kingdom of Japan, we cannot forgive similar actions. The government is officially asking for help from us. It seems that we can overcome it. Tonight we must act. Hagesuka, sorry if it's faster than initial estimates. Can you It seems that it can be even tight. Although the special weapons have not yet been completely sorted out, I will try as soon as possible. All right. Shin. Jin. Apologies in advance, but I ask for help! Good! Leave it to us. Then, next ... ... I will explain the gun that is at the bottom. When this bullet hits a long range human weapon will then automatically send a corrupted program to the Fixer's brain. In essence, this could sever the forced fix process that was taking place. Destroying brain cells? Meaning, what about the Fixer that is connected to it? Both of you are given one gun and one bullet, so use it when it's really urgent. May I interrupt? Please. Shin, I have something to talk about. Can you come with me? Alright. In that case, while waiting for him, let me explain this foot-enhancing shoe. Yes. It is impossible ... Kotori? Is he still alive? He is dead. It's just that, his body is still alive. How come ... Why? Actually I know this act is against humanity. However, I don't want to lose Kotori! Did you know that your father, Hazama Kenji ... ... researching about causes of sudden death? Yes. But for the details ... His wife ... ... that is, your mother who died suddenly caused deep sorrow for her. Then at the same time, he was afraid of losing you suddenly. Me? To protect you from sudden sudden death that can happen at any time so he tried as fast as possible to complete the research and get the results. Father ... For my sake ... However ... In the end ... His research was successfully completed. He has succeeded in finding a way to prevent sudden death. Your father has found a theory breaker of the relationship between the two worlds. My father ...? Yes, but no method can be found to implement this theory. However ... ... if it's you, you might be able to save the world. Kotori ... Yo. I heard from Mr. Kakitsuka, he said your father was a great researcher. ​​That might be ... Actually, I just heard today too. Regarding what my father did. Is that so? Your father is also great. Can create robot humans, and transmission devices. Yes, that's how it is. However, when my father succeeded in creating it, I questioned whether this would be okay. The thing is I also don't understand what he is saying, That's why I always hated him for a long time. Apparently so. Thank goodness your reaction is normal. To my father, I ... I always misunderstand. Because since my mother's death, my father has continued to do research, he rarely returned home. Well, the name father mah must be. My father is also similar. My father did not talk about anything at all. Should I ask? It's possible. We don't know since when, we become like partners. Well, because I am you. I see. Well ... It's time. Come on! I'll leave it with you! Good! Only to them, we can entrust this! Is this the other Japanese? Come on! Good! There are no people. Because people who roam at night will be subject to criminal charges. Is that the only reason ?! Here is a world like that. So many. Leave it to me. I will guide them. Captain! Go away! This is ... ... leader's castle! Starting from here, let Miko guide. The current leadership is also controlled by the Council, right? Yes, you should! It is impossible ... The new leadership was treated as well ... Board room in the back leadership room. We cannot cut the road. Yes, I understand too! Charging has been completed 90%. Walah, Ma'am Miko. Turns out you have returned. Too bad. It turns out you are, huh? Riko. He has done the fix ... ... with the councilors? The riot that happened earlier, is that your doing? Your fixer, which is Kotoko ... ... aka Kotori, they have been killed! Kotoko who if we were not collected would only live on a pile of garbage, but instead expected things to be excessive, it was only natural that he would be killed. Riko. I'm starting! Very light. Why do you who have a mild determination dare to oppose me ?! Miko! So annoying. Damn, he's so strong ...! Riko is now doing a fix with all the boards. As such, his determination and ability increased dramatically. Can such a thing be done ?! Yes, that is why his consciousness has also been snatched away. The old Riko ... ... it's gone ... Charging has finished 98%. What is that ?! The time is almost here, so don't disturb me. Soon we will go to the next stage! We will get a new world! Charging has finished 99%! Shin, this is bad. Behind him were conveyors! Riko uses her own energy to activate it! What will happen ?! Possibly everything in this dome will be sent to your world! How could you ... Charging 100 percent complete. Wow! What's up ... this? What really happened ?! Excuse me! There is a strange event in Shinjuku! What the heck is this ?! Damn! How do you overcome this ?! Jin! It turns out that way, no? Alma is disgusting. You too! What kind of move is that ?! Now's the time! Here ... It is impossible ... Damn! Miko! Do you think you can win against us with just this ?! He did a fix with all board members? How careless! Yes, but only with this we might be able to win. He managed to stop it earlier! -Jin. -What? In the next attack, let me bet! Yes. If you want to bet, then me too. Because we are both of one life. Let's protect the world! Don't get in the way! Feel it! It's annoying! Jin! I won't let it! Come on! I ... I ... will not give up on my own world! Miko! Shin! Is this all over? Riko ... Who am I? You are Riko. Oh yeah. Riko. I am the princess, Riko. No, you are just an ordinary Riko. What are you talking about? Who are you by yourself? You bully. Your fixer is gone. Nothing? How could that be possible. I feel it in me ... It's not! I am ...! It's not like that! I haven't finished this yet! What's inside you is data from the councilors. In this world, I ...! In this world ... Walah. Why me? Riko, you have worked hard enough. It's time to end this. I ...! We ...! Stop it! Stop it! Inter-box recordings are being initialized. Inter-box recordings are being initialized. Record between boxes is being initialized. Greetings, Ma'am Miko. What's wrong, Ma'am Miko? Welcome back, Riko! Shin. We still have final assignments. Go away. Jin ... In place of your father, you will cut the relationship between two lives, right? Yes. See you later. Take care of yourself. You too. Until then, I was you. Yes. Myself is you. Then, let's get started! Separating the two worlds. Yes. Maybe we were born for this purpose. Thank you for giving us the meaning of life. Kotori. What? I like you. Ashita Sekai ga Owaru toshitemo Sekalipun esok dunia kiamat PendekarSubs x WibuSubs Ending
