So the arrangements for Saturday are going very well. -Very well, small, intimate. -There you go. I saw this man being interviewed once on TV. And his job was to walk out into these vast deserted fields and deactivate land mines hidden beneath the surface. So every day this guy put his life on the line. And, uh, when the journalist asked him, you know, why would he want such a fucked up job, you know what he said? He said I have two wives, 15 children, and I live with my mother-in-law, and when I'm out in those fields, it's just so quiet. It's just so fucking quiet. I'll see you in New York. Excuse me. Thanks for the coffee. -Sure. -Okay. -[sighs] -Well, that went great. -I think that went very well. -Yeah. -[knock on door] -[Elliot] You in there?

I have a feeling that's the point. [engine starts] [♪] We can still make it down for her funeral, Tom. She's gone. What's the point? -Should say goodbye. -To what? An empty shell in a wooden box? No, thanks. I think you're wrong. I'm not going. Look, I don't want to either, but it's the right thing to do. I don't want to see him. She would understand. [Elliot] Shit, do you even believe in God? I believe in life and death. I hate them both. You know? The life expectancy of a man living in Roman Times was 30 years old. And they built the greatest empire in the world. So? That's all I want. That's all we need. You know, just fuck it. Fuck living, fuck dying. Just-- Just give me those years and I'm all good. Twenty-seven is the magic number. You're crazy, man. No. I'm in control. [car rattling] [female reporter] Tom Wallace's management still hasn't released an official statement, but we can confirm that the lead singer of the band Finn became the latest member of the 27 club earlier this week, joining the likes of Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobain, all of whom died at the age of 27 during the peak of their careers. The funeral will be held in New York this weekend, but the location will not be disclosed because it will be a private ceremony. However, his management does recognize that all you loyal Finn fans want to pay your respects, so there will be a public memorial service... I can't believe he's dead. It's stupid. -It's not stupid. -Yeah, it is. You turn 27 and decide that's it, it's over. Why would you do that? Well, I'm pretty sure that whatever makes you do that to yourself is more than just a number. It's stupid, Stella. It's not stupid. It's sad. [♪] [♪] -Where are you going? -To Joplin, Missouri. Can I catch a ride with you guys? If you want. -I'm Stella. -Don't wake him. Thank you. -Where are you from? -Ireland. Why are you here? My dad's working over here. -You're in school? -Yeah. You run away? No, my parents are on vacation and I don't drive so this is the only way I can get there. You don't drive? No, see, my dad doesn't want me to learn here, because in Ireland, we drive on the left side of the road. On that side? Yeah. Well, that's a weird. This is Stella. -Picked her up. -Huh? I'm really sorry, I-I didn't know. I just-- I really needed a ride and I-- He said it was okay, um, I didn't-- I can get out. He'll be fine. [waitress] No cheese, no tomatoes, no nothing? [young man] Just plain, please. No mustard, no pickles, no nothing? No, thank you. -And for you? -The same, please. So what's in Missouri? Ask him that. I have to deliver a letter to someone there. -How far away are we? -About two hours. So we'll arrive tonight? Maybe we should get a room, and go in the morning. I'll sleep in the car. I don't have enough money for a room. We could share. You wouldn't mind? Two twin beds. Thank you. That's really nice of you. I'll probably snore. [♪] -[young man] Look at that. -[Stella] Wow. [♪] [laughing] -That was fun. -Yeah. I want to go on that one, though. It's really hot. -One, two, three. -What you counting? -One, two, three. -What you counting? What you counting? I don't understand. You speak funny. So do you. I like it. Come on, let's go. I'll race you. [♪] [young man] Dear God above, send us love. Keep us safe, away from harm. Let us smile, make us good. Help us be great like thee. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Hey, Elliot, it's Anna. So Tom's autopsy came back uh, just to let you know it looks like an overdose. We're waiting for the full breakdown of the report before issuing any sort of statement. -I'm sorry-- -[phone snaps shut] Percocet, five. Oxycontin, four. Checkmate. [thunder rumbling] [Stella] How come you two are friends? He hired me. To be his friend? -To drive him. -He's paying you? I like driving. Where are you going? To New York. There's someone that I have to see. -Like your boyfriend? -No. Don't have a boyfriend. Do you have a girlfriend? No, never have. You know, my dad doesn't think I should go out with boys here, -because in Ireland-- -They drive wrong? Something like that. [thunder cracking] God, I hate storms. It'll be okay. Just stay inside. I hate them. God's taking pictures. [thunder crashing] [♪] [thunder continues] [♪] [♪] [thunder crashing] It seems really close. Hope Elliot's okay. Yeah, me too. Should I check? [crickets chirping] [splashing] Are you okay? Please answer me. Are you okay? You need help? [thunder rumbling] [♪] [♪] [birds chirping] [man] Good morning, everyone. We will not be taking questions at this time, but we can confirm that Tom Wallace, the lead singer for the band Finn, passed away in the early morning hours on Sunday. We can confirm that traces of various narcotics and prescription medication were found in Mr. Wallace's blood work. We are in the process of conducting a thorough toxicology report and we are awaiting confirmation from the state coroner. Mr. Wallace's management has not yet released an official statement, but has asked that you respect the privacy of his client, Elliot Carrigan, the remaining member of Finn and Mr. Wallace's father, his only surviving relative. I have aspirin. I'm good, but thank you. [♪] You grew up here? No, we left before we'd grown up. Who's we? Me and my best friend. [♪] Hey, listen, why don't you guys go and get something to eat over there. I'll catch up with you in a while. -Pat and Joe's? -Sure. -See you later. -Bye. [paper rustling] Elliot. Catherine Long time. Yeah, it has been. I'm sorry. Yeah. -You look good. -Bullshit. [chuckles] All right. You look like crap. What am I supposed to say? I don't know, something like you miss me. Great to see you. [sighs] [baby cries] That's my son. Uh, Dave Adwin's his father. No shit. Yeah. No shit. Hey. Tom's, uh, mom was buried up at the church. I know. I was at her funeral. I thought I'd see you there. Yeah, it just didn't work out that way, you know? Yeah. Thought about, uh, taking some, um... -Flowers? -Yeah. Okay. Wanna sit down? You know what? I'm-- I'm gonna go now, but it was real good seeing you again. Okay. [♪] Well. Tom wrote you a note. I know. Haven't you boys been gone a little too long to be writing notes? I think you should read it. I think you should leave. Was he sober when he wrote it? Yeah. Then I know it don't mean shit. So, you boys got to see your name in lights. You made these cool friends. Had all these people loving you. Because out of all those new folks he met, I can tell you, his mother loved him the most. Well, he wanted to come. We were in New York when we heard. He didn't want to see you. My only hope is that she was still traveling up to heaven and didn't have a chance to look back down and see that you boys weren't there. You know what? I'm gonna go. You know, I always felt sorry for you, Elliot, because you didn't have anybody. And now with Tom gone, well, I guess there really isn't much of life left for you, is there? But I'm sure some of those drugs will take the edge off that. [door closes] [♪] Oh, I'm sorry. [sighs] Sorry. Thank you. You really liked him, huh? [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] We should go find Elliot. Let's get the check. I got money. That's a lot. Yeah, it is. Did you eat? No. Wanna get something? Not really. [lighter clicks] Wanna head back? Nope. Well, then, what? New York. That's where I need to go. Do you mind if I keep riding with you guys? Nope. Never been there. [♪] -[young man] Know what's fun? -What? Playing I spy. Go for it. I spy yellow. Your shirt? -The lines on the road? -No. The sun. What, that's it? I don't get a second guess? Sorry, you lose. That's hardly fair. [♪] Have you ever seen what's in Elliot's bag? No. It rattles. Yeah, it does. Is Elliot okay? Why do you ask? I'm just worried. In case he goes swimming again? That scared me. I don't think he meant to. I just think he's going through a hard time right now.

Didn't want to eat any of that stuff anymore. Hm. Well, how about that? [chuckles] I haven't touched anything for five days now. Nothing? I've touched them, but I haven't taken them. Well, see, that's all from right there. My best friend died. I'm, uh-- I'm real sorry to hear that, son. He was an asshole. [chuckles] We're all assholes. -I miss him. -Yeah.
