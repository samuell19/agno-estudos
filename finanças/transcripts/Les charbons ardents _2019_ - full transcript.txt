THE BOY FACTORY THEY ARE AGED 16 TO 19. THEY LIVE IN THE ARDENNES, IN THE PARIS REGION, AND IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. Amine, open your bag please. - Where are you? - Other side. - The bag! - Open Théo's first. Give me your keys. No, like I showed you. No... Yes, go ahead, go ahead. You're adding… Hamza, you're adding mortar on mortar. What I like is touching things, being able to do things with my hands, that's what I like. My father was an electrician, so, he I learnt from him as a kid. And then it just made sense, I couldn't see myself behind a desk all day. Since I felt comfortable working with cars back in Africa, I thought: "Why not mechanics?" And here I am. I didn't have time to really figure out what I wanted to do, so I went for mechanics, on an impulse. But I don't think I made the right choice. Because you don't know, when you're 15, you don't know. I'm scared of making a choice and then regretting it. That's rough. You're scared of getting it wrong. Like "Oh God I got it wrong." We're at that age, you must know what you want to do. You must shake yourself up. The other students look down at us. Because we're in a vocational course. They think we're... that we're stupid. They think we can't do anything, except that, it has nothing to do with that. General fields, it's like it's only made for the gifted. And like we're not good enough to get in. That's how people see it. Except that it's different in reality. Even the teachers talk about the vocational Baccalaureate as if it's… Denigrating. Yeah, that's it. Even on television, they talk about manual work as if it's archaic. Even my parents, at first, didn't want me to go for a manual job. My father works in a factory. He told me: "Seriously, don't go for a manual job." My father didn't want me to do his job. It's a factory job, with steel, metal bars, it's heavy. The tendons on one of his shoulders have gone really bad. He has like an occupational illness. He didn't want me to struggle like he did. There's some disconnected wires. My dad, I think he works on construction sites. He can get work from public projects, and in factories too. He doesn't have a fixed job. I don't know, like a temp, I don't know how you call that. My father works at the scrapyard, as a scrap merchant. I don't know, it looks like... a tough job. If you compare the job I want to do and my father's, it's nearly the same. But he doesn't seem to enjoy his job. I know I'll enjoy mine. Don't know if he does. I know that my father, he went through a lot when we were kids. For us to be here one day. For example, he worked in the desert, we didn't see each other often. As a kid, I didn't get why he wasn't there. I didn't get it. And now I get it, he sacrificed himself for us. So that we could be here today. My family pushes me a lot. So, I can't fail. If I fail, I'll be ashamed. I have to succeed in school, and give myself the means to do so. So that I don't disappoint him, and am able to provide for my family and myself. Double pressure. They've come a long way. They found work. They found a house. They had children, brought them up. You have no choice. You can't stay at home, their home, forever, and do nothing. You have to make the same effort, and draw from their life. You have to. Well my father's in France, and I came with my family. My Mum is in Africa, back home. When I first got here, I missed her. But eh, we spoke, and she said: "No worries, focus on studying. We'll see each other again." I took the initiative to leave my country, Cameroon, on 30 September 2013. Because my parents and I have nothing. Nothing. So, Yaya, did you find everything? We need a case, Sir. - What for? - We need to disassemble the machine… To add the oakum. I travelled across the desert, all alone, with no one else, I arrived in France at the age of 16. So me, in my mind, I'm twice my age. OK? OK, go ahead. Now I'm in school, despite everything I have witnessed, and, thank God, I'm OK. Now I'm in school, I work hard, it's all good. The French people gave me the opportunity to work in school, so why take advantage? The French people have given me power in life, even if I'm an illegal immigrant. There are values. Values. So, we'll be studying a peculiar case, the Carmaux strikes, with an important political figure, Jean Jaurès. I know that part of town. Yes, so obviously, you all know a district, square, street called "Jean Jaurès", but we're going to see why. Isn't that the fat one, Miss? So what's the film with Jean Jaurès? He works in those coal mines. What's that film with Gérard Depardieu and the mines? I don't know. - You told me about it. - I give up. - Germinal! - Germinal. And who wrote the story in the first place? - Émile Zola. - Yes, Germinal. Oh oh oh! You're on fire. You good? Good? Aymen, hurry up, write please. Can you tell me what a labourer is, Bamba? - Someone who... - A labourer is... Is your name Bamba? Thank you for this terrific answer, Bamba. They work in the mines... - I'm asking you a question. - So why is he answering instead of me? They're the ones working in the industry... - Work in what? - The industry? It's people working with their hands, OK? And the middle-class, does their job involve using their hands? No. Indeed, that's the main difference. The middle-class use their intellectual ability in the professional world, rather than their manual ability. What's an anarchist? The revolution, like Louis XIV, Miss. "Anarchy like Louis XIV"? That's a concept I didn't know of. - Can someone further explain? - The revolutionaries. Absolute anarchy. No, I think you mean "absolute monarchy". Oh right, the monarchy. Demonstrators are seen as anarchists because they don't comply with the order, even less so the company's, since they're going against management. They request the mayor's reinstatement, since he is a minor and trade union member of the company. Jean Jaurès will publicize the Carmaux strike. So, in condemning this injustice... Right, Abdou? Right, Norbert? Right, Yacine? When someone works hard in school, it's because he's found a purpose, I think. And I haven't found mine, since primary school up to high school, I've always been disruptive. If I was given the opportunity to go back in time, I think I would have worked far more. I regret now. That feeling... I fear for the future. I don't know what to do. What am I doing here? How will it go? How will I end up? And I was told: "That's normal, because now you don't have any opportunities. You chose a path, you have to stick to it." It's going to be tough, it's not over yet but… I'm scared, I don't know what the future holds for me. It's important to know what you're going to do. That's one of the only things I'm worried about. I'm not the only one. A lot of other young people, like me, don't know what to do later. I have a lot on my mind. I'm still young, I can do plenty of things. Next week you'll have finished your internship. Yeah, last week, and then... holidays, right? Do you know what you're going to do? Not yet. You have to find a summer job. You can, you're 17. You have to start working. It's nice in school. Once you finish, it's not the same. Even with a vocational Baccalaureate, it's tough to find something. While in school, we think we'll find something, find a job and all. But that's not how things go. We send CVs, work for various companies... It's tough. You know you'll be one among so many others. And it doesn't mean he'll choose you. He'll choose someone who's better than you. That's what's a little scary too. Not having a job. Ending up doing unskilled work, or just odd jobs. That's not interesting. And with that robot business, robots that can do anything. So yes, it's normal for us to freak out. We don't know if we'll have a good job in the coming years. The world was a tougher place before, but at least there was work. But now, machines are replacing people. I think it's a bit… There are more unemployed people. So, more things done with machines, whereas it wasn't necessary. But that's technology. We can't go against progress. When I listen to my grand-father, he says he struggled. Back then, they liked working because... work was like a family. Now you have to be all alone without anybody else. With the job cuts they make when people retire, and these jobs aren't reopened for young people. That's why I see things so negatively. I don't know what the future has in store for me but... I have a pretty bad feeling. They want to push the age of retirement to 68. I mean, they're crazy. They haven't a clue how hard it is, like my dad at the factory, they have no idea. Nice and cosy in their office, signing papers, they have no idea. They should try and work in a factory for a month, take off their suits, put on some overalls, and see what it's like to struggle, working with iron, they'll see what it's like to struggle. I watch the news sometimes, unemployment hasn't dropped, we can try and change the government, nothing ever changes. I find that no one has been able to reduce unemployment. It's a tough job, and nowadays it's hard to find work. It's hard to work, to build a future for yourself. I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way, I think we're all in the same boat, thinking: "What are we going to become?" For starters, I'm not even sure I'll have a job, whereas some people, their family works there, they can pull some strings, and they'll get by fine. But for people like me, it'll be harder. To find a job, and get fixed up. The toughest part for me, is not being able to achieve my goal, not being able to succeed, not being able to start a family, not being able to give back to society what I was taught. Not being able to help the coming generation, the way I was helped growing up. I don't know, bro. We work like dogs. You're scared of working like a dog. But you work like a dog too. I don't want to work like a dog either. You don't want to work like a dog, but you'll work. Leave me work, I've been working since I was a kid. I don't want to be a fucking intern, these guys do fuck all. What are you doing? It's nuts, you work like a dog, tidy this and that. Try and understand because... Basically you're an intern. It's not his job, you're the intern. I don't give a fuck, I get paid. You think he's going to tidy up? You're an intern. You work in shit, and those assholes don't pay me, no way. It's not shit, it's not a job. Depends what you do, if you're a plumber, you do. But you're doing an internship as a plumber…! I'm not doing a plumbing internship! Oh yeah, so what are you doing? - Um… heating engineer. - Yeah so shut up. What the fuck is that? A heating engineer is also a plumber. Hey, I've never had to unclog a loo. So how do you picture your future professional career? Who here would be willing to leave? With 3,000 euros a month, I'll go. No less. Less than that, no. The company can't pay you 3,000 euros... Depends on the job. OK then, let's say, in your case, motorbikes, be it to work in a motorbike garage, you want to work there in maintenance. Let them go to the competition! If they lack stuff, it means they need me. If need me, I impose my conditions. He'll go for someone willing to work with the minimum wage, - It's not a matter of salary... - and doesn't make a fuss rather than... The way he says it. Like you'd say: "Yeah I can work." "Do this, do that." He'll be like: "Go fuck yourself, shut up." Why would I talk that way to an employer? I don't know. You were like: "Yeah I impose my conditions." No, you tell him why you've come from so far, couldn't find a job... You smooth-talk him. You say: "I have this, can do this, can do that." "I can work this amount of hours." "I don't have a penny, I need help." "You need me, I need me." - "You need me, I need you." - So you can't imagine, changing region? No, if the wage is good, I follow the money, Miss, I'm telling you. I'll follow the money. If the wage is better someplace else, I'll go to that place. I work there for two years, make some cash and come back. Ah. So you just work for pleasure, do you? I work to be in peace, Miss. I'm telling you. And a lot here feel the same way. I dreamt being a millionaire, where all I do is sleep and the money comes in every month. Well sure, that's the dream. If you're a millionaire, you have a better life. You have everything, you just wait to die. You sleep, wake up, you just wait to die, and that's it. Yeah, you have to earn money as soon as possible. In our society, yeah, to me… You have to earn money as soon as possible. That's what rules the world, money. But... How can I put it...? I personally place money on top of everything. Because, I don't know, I'd like to have money. I want to have money, I absolutely want to have money. When you have money, you have everything. When you have money, people respect you. Whereas when you don't, people couldn't care less about you, and that's it. But maybe I'll change my mind later on. But because I don't know what I'm going to do, that's the problem. I glorify money because I don't know what I'm going to do. So yeah, I glorify money. Because I have nothing else to do. Egghead... Men have always taken pride in bringing... yeah, bringing home the bacon. You work, bring home the bacon. In that case, you're a real man. I don't know, I'm old-style. The husband takes care of everything. The wife does everything, and he takes care of everything, works. The fact remains, that if the man stays at home, and the woman brings home the bacon... It's... I don't know, it's frowned upon. It's as if the man lost his abilities. I don't know. We could let ourselves go. I mean, later on. Imagine I have a wife. She works and so do I. Well then I'm more relaxed. Whereas, imagine, I know that if I don't come back with the salary, the house can't function. Because she's not working. It's worse to think of that. I think a woman can have, can do the same thing as a man. Even if I think it's hard. But if she can manage, good for her. But in that case, what does the man do? It empowers women, but it belittles men. It makes people believe that men are useless. And front gear. - Yes. - Papers. Papers, please. You drive too fast man! Speed up, speed up! I hit him. Quick, let's go, let's go, the cops are there. Let's go! What did they tell your mother? Miss... She talked so much. Luckily, she was with Aymen's mother. She stopped me in the corridor. What did she tell you mother? She said, "often comes in late", "trouble concentrating"... For me, it was Miss... Teachers always have trouble dealing with kids from the suburbs. They prefer normal people, not normal, but rather... the shy ones, you know, who don't talk a lot. But we were... that's how we grew up. We talked a lot, always, about this or that. They didn't like that. It's frowned upon by other people, by society. For people from the suburbs it's tough. But those living in houses, and whatever... They're better than us. When you grow up in the suburbs, you have that suburb state of mind. It's not the same as if we lived in... a big house. With a silver spoon in our mouth. It's not the same at all. Because if you... You're aware that you live in the suburbs, that you're... you belong there. But if you know you're fine, that your parents can take care of you, it's not the same, it's a different life altogether. When you live in the suburbs, you're isolated. Outside the suburbs, everyone has a job, everyone already has their driving licence. And you're in the suburbs, and you wonder why they have all that and not you. You want to make those efforts to succeed like them. But you just don't know how, you haven't a clue. It's better to stay near, yeah, near your neighbourhood, it's better. People who live really far away, you don't know how they are. Maybe they're not like us. They think differently. From the moment you're in your neighbourhood, you're home. Even if you're outside. In your neighbourhood, you're home. Because we've lived there since we were kids. It means we know everything, we know everyone, and it feels good. It's like being in my bedroom. I know where to go, who to hang with, who not to hang with… I don't know, I feel better. In fact, it's as if we were built together. We're all together, we grow up knowing each other since we were kids, in school. Yeah, built together. As kids, we all stay together, you know, mates. And then, when you grow up, some won't even recognize you. Won't even say hi. And then you have groups of friends. People drift apart, go their separate ways. And you're all alone. For example, we were plenty of kids. You grow up and there are fewer people. That's when you start panicking, getting really confused. What's it about suburbs? It's like a set of problems. Either you try and overcome it, or you just keep to yourself. You have to be strong. Everyday there's a new problem, and everyday you have to cope with it. Every single day. And I think to myself: "Fuck this is hard." I have this toughness inside of me because everything happens too fast. You question everything, go through stuff. And then you lose it. You think: "I have to leave, this isn't me." It's too tough. You have to leave this place. Living in the suburbs, that's a rough start in life. I'd rather my son grew up in a quiet neighbourhood, with no one selling hash outside, no bad influences and all. When there's a child, in the suburbs, it's like the older ones raise him. He'll listen more to the older kids than his mother or father. I'd rather he listened to me than mad guys. I don't want him to grow up there. Why? Because you're easily tempted to do bad stuff. And I don't want him to end up there. The street takes away people. It won't take away my son. What do you mean? It takes all of him from me, bit by bit. He starts doing things, then goes to prison. And the parents can't do anything. So you want to see something? Yeah. I don't want my son to get involved in that. When I take my scooter at 8pm, ride my scooter in the village. I really like that. People hate it, hate the noise, but I love it. It's fun, I like it. In my village, you get a little bored of the people, after a while. I wish there were more people. Fewer old fogies and more youngsters. That would be awesome. Oh, oh, he's gutted. Bastards. The most difficult thing for a teenager? To build pride, have pride and be respected, I'd say. Well some are... We're all different, so some will act tough, macho. Others will act like they're big shots, and others will just... How can I put it? Who'll let the tougher ones walk all over them. It always works like that. Either a group, or individual belittling another to feel better than others. Always works that way. If you hurt someone, or something like that, it's to make yourself look better. When everyone makes fun of you, you feel belittled. So you can't have the same life as those making fun, so, um... You see that and think: "Oh, I don't want to be on that side." I want to be one of those who goes to school and feels like, yeah, just feel good basically. And to feel good, you have to make fun. It wouldn't even cross my mind, to drive someone crazy, non-stop, non-stop. I've been through that myself, I know how it feels. I don't think they're aware of that. But I know how it feels. It was hard at first, because I came from another city. In the beginning, it's just teasing, and then it's insults. And then it's clashes. I don't know, they used to hit me, etc. They threw stones at me. I was a kid, I didn't get why they were doing that to me. Up until my neighbour, because I had a neighbour. We laughed a lot, we were really close. He went to them, he slapped them all and said: "Don't touch him" and all. And then it eased off, and then I made lots of friends. Sure, five months is a lot. It makes us grow up differently. Whether you get beatings or not, you don't become the same person. I was always a very calm person. But then, if you get into fights, you change completely. Look at those delicate ankles. Look at him, bro. Look at that victim. No. His bones sticking out... No respect at all! He owns an Apple Store, dudes. Who are you talking about? He felt targeted! I don't know, I heard that, and then you staring at me like that. - Did you brush your hair today? - Shut your mouth! Slap you, Kevin. Like that, like that. I'm going to slap you. - Take your glasses off. - Kevin, I'm going to slap you. Go ahead Norbert, slap him. He's fucked, he's fucked, he's fucked! He runs like an old man, Norbert. He hit him for real! Norbert lost his temper. Bitch. He's mental. He hit me... You lost it, you lost it... Norbert, you run like a tortoise. - You run like an old man. - Like a tortoise. Speak French. - You run like a tortoise. - Speak French. - Catch me if you can. - A tortoise, a tortoise. Lots of girls complain because… "We have to put up with having our periods…". And boys, they have nothing. Except that we... we have to... We have to, for example, when there's a fight, we have to go, otherwise people judge you. That's as hard. Say I have a problem with someone, if I don't hit him, or if he hits me and I don't hit him back, then I'll lose people's respect. I lose my credibility, that's it. I'm here, they're 15. One of them is being a smart ass. So either I take all 15 down, or I take down the smart ass. I'd start with the smart ass anyway. So the others think: "Yeah, we're going to respect him." Someone who's respected is someone who can fight hard, who fights well and… Is just the best, that's what I think. I've convinced myself of something: people can't disrespect me. In some schools, we hear so and so stabbed someone. For some mobile phone business... or so and so was disrespectful. I don't know, they want to act like grown-ups. It happened between high schools. It could get a bit violent. Some ended up in hospital. We were really stupid. We thought we were gang members. The grown-ups, it's like they're pressuring us. They wanted us to be like them. To be fearless, if a fight broke out, we had to stick with them. I don't know. Like they were manipulating us. Like, I don't know, They provoked you. If you didn't take part in a fight, they laid into you, called you a "fag". So you're pissed off, you go up him. And you hit him. That was their deal. You had to fight. Sometimes, when I fail something, a fight for example. It's hard to look at the others in the eye. That's the thing. That's it. For example, the macho guys, that's why they want to be strong... To, in a way, avoid that system. Avoid being humiliated, humiliation. That's what we're avoiding. Sometimes you have to prove something. Say you're outside, everyone's there, and someone belittles you, and you do nothing about it. Basically it's like letting everyone believe they can do that. So if you don't act, you know damn well than some day, that guy that was there will come and belittle you. That's when you have to show who you are, whether he's big, small, strong or not. You have to be there. When you go out, you never know what could happen. You don't know what could happen. You always have to be aware. You can't lose focus. As soon as someone insults you, you have to react. You give your word, you keep it. Commitment. I don't know how to explain honestly, you just have to be there. Respect is important. That's the way it is. Especially in the suburbs. We learn that very early on. Disrespect can turn really bad, worse than other places. You have to watch your step. Those who provoke us on the street, they do it because they know we're scared. If you look determined, at ease, they'll think twice before coming up to you. That one, the way he walks, if we go up to him he'll... like lose it. It's a lot about appearances. When you see someone who's all tiny and skinny, you're not scared of him. You can dominate him. But then, there's another one, who's bigger and stronger, he'll dominate the first one, that's how it goes. First, people have to be scared of that guy. And he'll be the strongest. Like people know you can't mess around with him. But that's not between friends. That's how it is in the suburbs. But like you know you can't mess around with him, because he can kill you. Yeah, some people have a reputation. Where he comes from, the things he's done, why he's the way he is. Say if you're from a tough suburb, really tough, you have to outdo yourself. You get insulted by... You don't dare to say anything, you don't dare... I don't know. You don't dare to provoke him. Because you know you just mustn't. Some guys go like "He went to prison for nine months, we have to show him respect." Depends on the people, on what they've done in life. He went to prison, knows what it is. So no, you don't get up his nose. He's not... not like me. Because he's been through something tougher than I ever have. It depends on what you go through. I've had to fight so much. I had to fight to be where I am. I slept in Château-Rouge station, Gare du Nord, Saint-Lazare station. I slept in Herblay forest. When I first arrived in France. I spent at least month outside. In the middle of winter. A whole month outside sleeping in stations and so on. You had to impose yourself, in the outside world. You had to impose yourself. As soon as you got up, you had to start again. If someone was sleeping on your spot, where you'd spend the night, you did what it took to make him leave. Sometimes it turned into a fight. You had to fight to earn your spot. I spoke with a deep voice. They never noticed that, behind this deep voice, I was just this little guy. There were times where I was scared, but I didn't want to show it. I mean, boys too are allowed to be scared, but you just can't show it. Impossible, impossible. Because a boy who shows he's scared, he's a victim, he's prey for the others. I don't know but either way, you can tell when someone's scared. Even if he tries and hide it, you can tell. He'll be like really chill, like "Yeah, I'm not scared" but... The way he speaks and so on, you can feel he's scared. That's the way I was brought up, you just can't. It's been that way since I was a kid. If you're scared, you're not one of us, full stop. In the Calanques, for example, there's Samena, we call it "the casemate". It's about 15 meters tall, something like that. Some guys jump from there. Head first and so on. When you get there, I mean man it's mental... You think "wow", and your mate is like "Come on, jump!" You don't want to at first. And he starts running, running, and does a backflip. He's in the water, swimming. And you're meant to jump. I can't tell him, he did a backflip or whatever... I'll just do the minimum. Even if I'm scared, I'll jump but like that. No backflip, just normal, you see what I mean? And at least he won't be able to say "You got scared, blah blah". "You're not a man"... That always comes up. "If you're a man, do it." Never show your weaknesses. Or else you're dead. It's over. You erase any weaknesses. Weaknesses will eat up a man. I don't think that as men, we can show any weakness. Because then people will start talking. You'll get a reputation. Well in high school, having a reputation. And then it's going to be a burden. And it all happens quickly, becomes tough. And then come the solitude, and that's really hard. Even if I'm a nice person and all. All of that is put aside, you just have to. You'll be walked all over some day if you're like that. So you create a persona. Deep down, you're not like that person but that doesn't matter. It's a shield. I personally have always hidden. When I felt my weaknesses come, I'd just disappear. I'd keep to myself, I cut myself off from the rest. And I'd go back to normal, life goes on. You don't show. You don't have to show them. No, to me you shouldn't show. People will provoke you, they'll take advantage of your weakness, and they'll finish you off. No, no one. Nothing. If you show your weakness, it's over. The weak point is... you just have to aim. So no, nothing. I think I haven't cried in two years. That's a lot. I keep everything to myself. The only time we cried among ourselves, was when we'd fight, or got really, really mad. You could hide behind the pretence that you're so angry, you cry a little. But for real, they got angry more out of fear, that's what I think anyway. It's already happened to me too, I've already cried for... because I was sad. But no one has seen me cry. No one. What happened to me in high school. So now I'm always... I don't talk a lot. I never confide in anyone. I know you can't open up to anyone just like that. Even a friend can screw you over. Everyone can betray. Everyone can make you believe you can trust them when you shouldn't. So you don't know who to talk to. So no. My answer is no, full stop. You never can be sure. You don't know. Don't dare. One of the reasons why I don't dare. You don't know who to talk to. You just don't. So I talk to myself. Because you can never know with friends. We can be friends today, and tomorrow enemies. You never know what might happen. That's why sometimes… Some things, you'll talk about, like with your family, but never your friends. Because we're scared of that system, as I told you. People disrespecting you, people making fun of you for this and that. Honour, it's a bit like… People confuse that with respect. Because we can get mixed up. It's like a warrior thing. Pride. In our neighbourhood it's a lot about pride. Honour to me, is the same thing as a woman's virginity. Because when a boy loses his honour, he's vulnerable. When you lose it, you lose it. When someone's made up his idea, it's done, too late. If you lose that, then you're no one to others. Some things are irreversible, and that's one of them. - Let's bet… - Take the cards. No, no. A guy with a bad reputation, I don't know, is scared of everyone. He's a fag. I don't know. Being called a fag, for example. Yeah, being a faggot... scared of everything, that kind of stuff. Being homosexual, I think. It's really frowned upon, a bad reputation. But where I come from. If it's just a joke, that's OK. But if it's really serious, then you're fucked. In the suburbs, you hide that. I don't know how they hide it, looks tough. What's her name? What's her name? - Hey what you doing? - Elouli… - Yeah. - Are you going to go out with her? - Oh no. - You've cut your hair... You're a pain, I swear, if you touch my hat like that... Achoo! Gross... I'm putting you out of action. Get it? - But baby… - Leave me alone, no "baby" with me. OK. This girl, I don't know if she's interested in me... - What girl? - Stop hitting me! I swear… She was beautiful, intelligent, sexy, gorgeous. Look at Vanessa's bra! Look, look! Get off me. Look, look. She wore glasses, had blue eyes. Oh... Just boys, it's boring, because it's tough. I don't know. With girls, they're gentle, attentive. Feminine. I like their company. I find them funny. I mean they're like us. Maybe a little crazier than us. You can't share everything with boys. I don't know. It's like girls they… They get you better. The suburbs are for boys. Girls rarely stay there. It's just dudes. The more girls grow up, the more they go backwards. Growing up, they know that one day they'll settle with a man. They can't spend their whole life with boys. The cable's too small. Five divided by three. The thing's cable. The starter. We make it seem relaxed. But I don't know, it's weird. I don't know, we're scared of others. You don't what they'll think, take you for an idiot, be sincere... We make it look normal. But deep down, we're on our guard. Prepared. - In case. - Prepared for what? I don't know, I don't know. Like with a girl, I'm prepared, and she takes me for an idiot. I'd rather be the bad guy, and not her. Because I don't want her to screw me over basically. You need to be able to handle stuff. Always handle stuff. Don't get too excited. That's what I've been told. Never be… You must never be more in love than the girl. And even if you are, you mustn't show it. Because then she's too confident. Then the girl, she feels too… It makes her feel too important. You grow attached to a girl, and then the boys will tease you about it. Like, you're a sensitive guy. You have feelings, and so on. But everyone's like that. Even them, if one day they fall in love, they'll be sensitive too. In a relationship, you see people change. If we notice he's changed because of that girl, that he does things he didn't use to, that's just a no-no, it means the girl got in his head. And that means you've lost control. There are no secrets. There are no secrets here, you can't hide anything. Yeah, he'll hide at first, because he doesn't want to... draw attention on himself. But then... little by little, people talk and talk. From one person to the next. A boy who has sex with a girl, in fact it's the girl who's going to get a reputation. They'll make more fun of her than the boy. Because for a boy, it's nothing, he did what he had to do. But the girl, she'll be called a slut. The boy won't be called names. That's what I mean. That's what's hard for a girl. For a girl, even if she's been dating the guy for two years, and she's had sex. Once she breaks up, they'll start calling her names. People saying she's crazy and so on. But for a boy it's normal. He did what he did. A decent girl is a girl... who doesn't have sex with just anyone. She's in a serious relationship, you don't have sex after barely two weeks. The girl has to be ready, you have to be ready. So I don't know, it comes with time. A girl who has no respect for herself will, for example... Like a fuck buddy. That's a girl who doesn't respect herself. One day you go up to her, the next day she's at your place. You just do what you want with her. That's a girl who doesn't respect herself. And a boy? A boy who does it with a girl in a day? Honestly, kudos to him! It's not the same point of view, I don't know. A boy who does it with lots of girls, I don't know, it's positive. For us dudes. Honestly, it's unfair. That's unfair. We should all be equal. You see a guy with five or six different chicks. And then a chick with five or six dudes, it's the same thing. I don't see why you'd call the girl names and not the guy. Guys too should be called names. That's it. But too bad, it always falls on the girls. For me, it's really, it's... I'm allowed to have several girlfriends. That's normal, I don't know. We're young, we need to make the most of it. I'm still young. It normal for me to date lots of girls. I have to find the right one that I'll stay with. But I haven't found her, so it makes sense for me to go from one to the next. That's normal, logical. It's a competition. I'm with a friend, let's say several friends. Say he comes up to me and say: "Yeah I dated that one." So I'll aim higher and say: "I dated that one there." And then I'll say: "I have three." He'll go: "I have four." And today like "I got two", and now "I got three"... If you listen to some of them, they have a list of conquests. "That one, this one, and that one. "She's like this." Some will even push it further. "Yesterday it was a White girl", "a Black girl", "a Spanish girl"... That's mental, I mean it's insane. You come across so many girls like that, you think to yourself: "My baby sister, she can't end up like that." I need to protect her. Some girls, I'd chat them up, did my business, and then it was over. Now I realise it was really bad of me. Because we all have a sister. You wouldn't like it if someone did that to your sister. I don't have a sister. I'm glad. I'm glad I don't have a sister. Because it's hard. You have to watch over her. It's full of wolves. Keep an eye on her. Her brother won't let her do anything. She can't drink, can't smoke, can't stay out late, lots of things. She can't hang out with young boys. I have a sister, for example. My sister she doesn't really go out. If someone, one of my mates, talks to her like, behind my back, that's disrespectful. You're in a bubble, you don't know how you'll react. You don't know what you're going to regret doing, you don't know what the consequences will be, but you don't care. Family is off-limits. That falls under a brother's responsibilities. That can't be the parents' job. Parents have other duties. But we're there, we know what's going on. We know how she is outside of home. Fine, she can be with a man. You have to know what she's doing with him, that's all. If say, I hear something one day, this directly attacks me too. Me, directly. Because some will think he hasn't done anything about it, his sister does that, and he did nothing. We call them the "tired" ones. Tired like, he did nothing, he was asleep. When someone touches your sister, or a member of your family, that means you, you're not here. You're transparent. I told you, round 6pm. - Meet you at the car. - Will you pick them up? No, no, I can't at 6pm. I'll come tomorrow. I don't have much time, I can wait for you till 6pm. I'll call you if there's a problem. Yeah, call me. - Stop it. - Hey, Rocky. Didn't you wash your hands? His hands are already... Yeah, he just did the tooth and presto. What a fag. - How could I walk on it? - Was it on the floor? - Yeah, it was. - Oh well I'm sorry. You dropped it. You squash it and look. Asshole, faggot. Saturday's going to be wild! If only you knew! - An Arab night again! - Well a little, it's in a hookah bar. When will you invite me to those nights out? There's something on Saturday... Saturday is 'magalo'. Week-end! I'm going to buy the perfume. Do you have to wear a shirt and all? I'm wearing my sweatsuit, screw this! Everyone will stare at you. Are there any pretty girls, or is it just... - Oh yeah, plenty. - Yeah, plenty. You won't want to leave once you get there. Oh yeah, and they come up to you like... As long as she isn't from my hood... That's possible. But a girl from my neighbourhood, no way. Loads of people would talk, everyone would know. Or maybe I'd know her brother, her father, her mother... I don't like that. Forced to do everything in secret. Even seeing her, you have to do it in secret. You can't do everything you... I don't know, you can't do what you did with another girl. Say if she wasn't from my neighbourhood. I avoid that. No, no. Girls from the hood, that's tricky. So I told him: "If you don't like it, leave!" You wanted to get back together with me. And I said no in the beginning. But then you insisted, you wanted to get back together. I couldn't when you asked to meet on Wednesday, and you said no... Franck, stop raping her! For me, virginity is important. You should pick a virgin. Once you've found her, never let go of her if you like her. For me, it's because of my beliefs. That's the way I was brought up. Would have I been told my entire life? "You'll marry a virgin." So then in my mind, it was clear. And it hasn't changed. But then, you never know. I'm not marrying her because she's a virgin. I'll marry her because I like her. But I do want to know about her past. And if it's too, too... If I don't like it, then I won't do it. Or I'll have to think about it… I don't know... Honestly, I don't know. I don't know what I'd do in the moment. If I really love her, but has a past I'm uncomfortable with, maybe I'd still stay with her. Or then, if it's too dirty, I won't want to. I wouldn't know what to say. Depends on the people. Like last time, I was with this guy, we came across each other, talked a little, he told me he likes to fuck chicks, but he'd never marry one who isn't a virgin. He can only marry a virgin. Whereas he loves fucking chicks. That's the way it is, depends on the person. For me personally, if you're a decent chick, if you're... honest, who reflects on life, you know. I don't see anything wrong. Guys who want virgins, if you're not a virgin yourself, it's a bit tricky. I'm not asking for a virgin, if she's a decent girl. I have my background too. If she's a decent girl, I don't care. It's roughly what I was saying. What do you call the cougar's victim? What is she on about? You like underage black dudes, eh? Is it my fault you're a cougar? Are you a cougar? I'm the exception? No but you're still a cougar. Admit it. Come on, admit it. I'm a man, I'm real a man. See? And he can't stop laughing. Imagine, the guy takes a knife out. You're weird. What's up? What do you want from me? Cut it out! I want to stay a virgin till I'm married. As stated in the Koran, or in the Bible, everywhere. Because I'm following this path, I'm sticking to it. I'm just making my way. I've decided to wait. I don't want to have regrets, so I've decided to wait. I don't want to know how it works. Imagine I become addicted to it, how can I live with that? If there's no... I don't know. How can I find my pleasure otherwise? I'd rather wait. If I wait, maybe it'll be a real surprise. I think it has to do with religion. I'd say it's in relation to religion, but I don't have one. It's a question of principle. I was looking for the word, principle, manners. Religion explains it all: marriage, children, the way you have to do it all. In fact, our religion is like a user guide on how to live. I don't know, I don't know how to explain. There's two sides to it: the religious aspect, you know, regarding marriage, etc. And then, I can't go up to a girl like: "I want to have sex with you." I can't. I can't say it that way. Then it's true some mates will tell me: "Look at her, look at that one." I don't look, dudes. What's the point anyway? Because I'll look, but I'll do nothing about it. What's the point? I won't look, leave me alone. We all have urges, temptation, well, we want to find out. But because we have this barrier, which is religion, I personally abide by that barrier. And because I'm on the right track, I have to. There are a lot, a lot of temptations. It's pretty tough. I don't know, I resist. I endure and endure. I say to myself it's all worth it. To me, I'm doing things in the right order. But it is tough, I'm not going to lie. I talk to girls, I talk to everyone. I laugh with them, I go out with them... But then, as soon as I go home, I confess to God, and pray so... it helps me clear my head, yeah that's it. That's what I do. I read the Bible. Yeah, that's what I do. I find that religion protects you, it defends you. There you go, there you go... What do you want? What do you want? Shag, fuck... I don't know. There are so many, it's… Screw, bang. So many insane things you can say. Fuck, hump, bang, yeah. I don't know, "to fuck her", "do her"... There are so many words! I don't know why, yeah, why we're so disrespectful with chicks like that. "I'm gonna give it to her", "I'm gonna ride her", "I'm gonna fuck her"... "stick it to her"... Yeah, there's tons of them. Those are the ones I use most. He's always going to want to show off a little: "Yesterday I fucked her brains out mate, insane!" See? That's how people talk. And he's like: "Oh you're a good one." It's because they have that thing, you know, the dominant male. Like "We didn't sleep together, but I fucked her." Know what I mean? In the sense "It's me, I did it, I'm the boss." Because we have this image of fighting, "I'm gonna fuck you", that kind of stuff. But then when we use it to talk about making love and so on, straight away, it's seen as violent. The girls I hang out with and talk to, they use the same words. They don't find it offensive. I don't know, depends on the way you say it and to whom. Like with my mates, I don't know, I'd say "fuck", but with girls, I'd say, "make love", see. It's different. But you know, the words "to make love", see? It's very strong. For me, it's really strong. To make love is like... "Oh you made love?" The guy will look at you like... And he'll say: "What's, 'make love'?" We don't use that word, I don't know, it's not part of our vocabulary. Making love is what you see in movies. Those cheesy movies, "make love", whatever, blah blah blah. That doesn't exist. They do that so that the others say they've become a man. That's it. Because a guy who hasn't done it yet, he's not a man. Some say they've done it, but in fact never have. You know? Some of them come up with crazy stories, like really elaborate. So you're there listening, listening, listening, saying total bullshit. Crazy stuff. And it's all coherent. It's like it actually happened. Really, they've invented it all. Some even convince themselves they've done it when they haven't. I learnt about love all on my own. Didn't tell my mates. We never talk about it with my mates. You do it alone. I don't know, through computers, Internet. You listen to some of your mates' stories. And a little in high school. With your mates, stuff like that. Or porn movies, or whatever. If you hang with the older ones. When you hang with older guys, you get to learn stuff. Could you imagine me going up to my father: "Hey, Dad..." He'd be like: "You're in high school and asking me about this?" We don't have that kind of relationship. Let's say it's taboo. No, I don't talk about it. People talk about it, talk about it on TV, you see everything on TV. And in school too, we learn stuff. Even in Biology, you learn stuff. Well in my school, the people I hang with, everyone watches porn stuff. I don't want to snitch, but everyone watches porn stuff. When I was younger, I used to watch some. It makes sense when you're a kid, you're curious. So we watch it. I know I have. If people have already watched some, that means if they're having sex for the first time, it will help them. Because porn shows you how to do it. For your first time, maybe they'll remember the things they've watched. We're still pretty young, we're 13, 14. We're not on top of our game yet, we haven't fully grown. So you look at yourself, and he has a huge one. What does that mean? So you start wondering, sure. How's my penis? Mine's like this... His is huge, what does that mean? That's when you're young, when you grow up you know it's fine. Same thing. I was told it wasn't like that. The thing lasts 25 minutes but in fact it doesn't last 25 minutes. They're actors, but then, it influences you as a kid. "That's how this goes, how that goes." They're monstrous. It's not real, it's a movie, that's why. They're seen at their best. And the girl she's like objects. It's a bit too much... The way the woman is used. I know it's not like that. But that's what you see in movies. What you see, that's how people interpret it. She's just used like an object. Based on what porn shows us, men dominate. Plus, based on what we've seen or put into practice. That's the way it is. But then, you won't treat... If it's your girl, you don't treat her like a slut, slap her, and so on. In our generation, the girls too look at these videos. Most girls, they like to be fucked, slapped, spanked, and so on. They like it. Because asking a guy to do this or that, that happens, if girls watch porn too. In the sack, I don't like it when the girl decides. I mean, I'm the man. Some things aren't going to change in my mind. I don't mind equality, but to some extent. Not full equality. For me it's the dominant male. I mean yeah, he's in charge of everything. He does all the work. He has to know everything, make her feel comfortable, encourage her. It depends on the girl, but in the beginning, we must show stuff to the girl, because she's more reserved. So we show her and then... Some girls will take charge, more than the man. Imagine the woman is in charge. We're going to feel a bit stupid. But if she really gets the upper hand, I don't agree with that. I see it as sharing pleasure. It's about sharing something. I don't see why one would take the upper hand or whatever. It's pleasure shared between two people. A Madagascan who falls in love with a French girl. There are many obstacles. The poem this student writes, let's imagine you're in his shoes. For instance, I don't know, you're going to live the same story. How will you proceed? I don't know, I'd go up to her. And then you just ask her "Where are you from," etc. You just built up a conversation. Precisely, you are able to build this conversation. He couldn't find the courage, - to go up to her like that. - He's shy. Mister Théo, who usually is shy, and blushes with these questions. Go. - I have nothing to say. - Of course you do! He has to move things up a gear, what can he do? He's just met her, and what, is he meant to propose already? I am asking a question, Théo. We could write it, but we're not going to. I'm asking you, Amine. What is true love to you? How are you going to define it? I don't know. It's scary. Say she says, "I love you", ad I say, "Me too". For example. I can't just whisper sweet nothings to her. I don't know. I guess it's a mental block. Boys are wary. They don't trust people. They're wary, so they're not going to say everything. Even if they really like the girl. You'll be like sure, "I love you". But won't tell her everything. For me it's a bit out of pride. Not revealing too much how you feel. A bit of pride and a bit of shyness. Is it warm enough? It's OK, I'm still in it. Come on! It's really nice, hallelujah! Oh the prettiest one is leaving. Don't leave, stay and watch! She saw your white boxer shorts, asshole! Even in the water, he hits on girls! No, I'd never do that. They were disappointed by your dive. They were disappointed by your dive. You're not even going to see me come out. That sucks! Just the water? What are we missing? She went like "bwah". They just saw us as clowns... Have you ever fallen in love? No. No, let's say no. Yeah, no. I don't know, I liked being with her, but I wasn't in love. I just liked being with her. Like I didn't dislike her. Let's say, she didn't get on my nerves. I'm not going to lie. Yeah, right now. No, right now... I'm telling you that because. I'm not going to lie. I'm not showing my weaknesses or anything. That's not a weakness to me. I don't care, I'm not with my mates. Sure, when my mates are around, I'll go like: "What are you on about? I'm not in love!" Why? Yes. Yeah, sometimes. I swear this time. For the first time, yeah, for sure. Is it nice? Yeah, it's nice. I didn't see it coming. It happened so fast. It happened so fast. And once you're in it, you're in it. You can't go back. I didn't think she loved me. But then she told me, I was really surprised. She was a friend, and we weren't close at all. But then it just happened. She came to see me play. Several times. Maybe not "in love". In fact, for me… I feel my heart beating, that's for sure, but actually being in love, I've only loved this one girl. There's a difference to me, between pleasure and love. Two different worlds. When you're in love, it's a very powerful thing. You can feel that. And that person, even if you're not dating her, you'll never forget her. That's it, I think. It only happens once. Not twice. The rest is just feelings. I've never had that. I don't think it happens at my age. Never. I don't know, sometimes I wonder if I ever will fall in love one day. When I see people jump from a balcony for a woman, stabbing themselves for a woman, I find that stupid. I even told my aunt once: "I don't know if one day I'll do something crazy for a woman." And she told me: "That's because you're still young, you haven't met a real woman yet." "The day you'll really meet a woman, it might happen." You fly high, come back down to earth. Like a piece of shit. That's how I see it. Everyone that's fallen... Even my mates who've fallen in love with a chick, when it's over, they're in pieces. They feel awful for three weeks. They stop smiling, can't stop thinking about her... I mean, you agree that's just bad. I understood that falling in love is dangerous. I find that falling in love, you just aren't the same. You... How can I put it? Just to enjoy that tiny little moment, you're willing to become a walking disaster, garbage. I heard about people, they did some crazy things for their girlfriends. I think that's mental. That's why I'm scared of love. I don't want to become like them. Buy her presents, do this and that... I don't really like the idea. When you're in love, what's really scary is breaking up. That's really scary. You're scared of getting hurt. It's like climbing a building, without any security. You climb, climb, climb, try and reach the top. If something comes off, you fall and get hurt. Back home, we say the heart has no bones. The heart is a muscle, it's very fragile. I'd like things to change between boys and girls. Because it's very divided. We should all stick together, no one judging you. Why has it always been men, assuming that role? Sure, we're stronger physically... Why does it always have to be like that? You have to be tough. That's how it is, but I don't know why. That's how we're meant to be, but I don't know why. It's transmitted from father to son. In my mind, I would like to see equality between men and women, I'd like to see that. But because I was brought up that way, I'm like blocked. I can't. That's the way I am. But then we'll see. The mentality has changed. It's not going to disappear overnight. It'll take time. Sure, I'd like things to change for girls.
