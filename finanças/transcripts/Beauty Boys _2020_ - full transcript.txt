Yaya, hurry up! It's rehearsal time with the boys, or bitches, rather. Make sure you come tonight. It'll be a hell of a show. Was that good? - Ambre. Get off the phone! - I'm advertising for you. Yeah, with her 67 followers. You should try not wobbling. You're like a baby lamb. But was it good? Yes! Okay. Good. So, Cookie's entrance. - It'll be great. - What didn't you get? - It's an open stage for everyone. - I don't think so. Fuck, you okay? Right, faggots. Clear off. Okay. So will you perform or not? I don't know. It'll create drama. What drama? You're called a faggot the minute you leave home. Enough. - Stop hiding. - We're not about to do drag. Why not? Of course! No! I wasn't up for the heels and crop tops. But there's a time and a place. This is the time! If we wait for it to change here, we'll be dead already. Yeah! Guys, you've been rehearsing in your rooms, camouflage-style, with heels on a rug so as not to disturb! And I won't cancel on my cousin. No, there's Cookie! Right, we'll do it. And in full drag! It'll be drag-attack in Vôge-les-Bains! You guys are nuts! It's guerrilla war, mate! Gue-rri-lla! - Get off here. - Okay. - I'll get some cans. - Okay. Hold on. That's filthy! I'll catch up with you. Yeah, right. Be a smart ass. Ladies! We've officially found me an ass! That's foul. Come on. Come on guys, smile! Godammit! It's the makeover from hell! Shut up! Look at him with his stinky mattress. We said full drag, sister. - Cookie can't think I'm a rookie. - But you are a rookie, honey! Quit bugging me. As soon as I mention Cookie, he flips his lid. - Cookie... - Cookie! Cookie, Cookie, Cookie... Not on Instagram. I don't want her to see. You are no fun! You took an hour to paint just one eyebrow. It's easy for you! Put on some glitter. No! Fuck! Why'd we meet near the dead guy's house? It's fine! No girl, it's not! I'm scared. Stop it. You're scaring me. - She must have left. - What? No! Good evening, children. Cookie! Heavens, you've come in drag! I almost got lost. I'm blind with these lenses. Let's see. Beautiful! And padded, darling. And you, with your moustache! Perfect, sweetheart. Like a pizzaiolo. Well, it's still just as nice around here. Luckily, I brought just what we need. Look. You're like Mary Poppins! And for the finale? Hold on. Come on girls, let's go. That's what your brother needs. This! Oh girl, I just finished my mouth. Fuck, fuck, fuck... Don't worry. You're beautiful tonight. Thank you. That's... That's kind. Come here, honey. So girls, tonight's your first time. Enjoy it. You'll remember it all your lives. The music! Be right back. There's one song. Don't start it till we strike a pose. Léo, is that you? Yes. Is it carnival? No. It's guerrilla war! Evening everyone. Welcome to Bain-les-Bains. We're happy to have an open stage. A chance for local youth to share their passions. So, I'll call up the first group, they're called "the Guerrillas." Sorry, the "Guerrilleras." With special guest, Cookie County. Give them a warm welcome. No! Your little brother really is scared of nothing. - What's with these fags! - Let's go! Are you kidding or what! Get your clothes off! Who cares. Come on, girls! Go for it! Are you into that? First the sequins, now a thong up his arse. I swear, your brother sucks cocks. What are you doing? - Shut the fuck up. - Get your hands off me! Get your hands off my brother. I'll see you around! Sorry, honey. You're not welcome here. Jules. Jules. Just clear off. Now I'm in shit. Wait! You're a frigging liability! - Didn't your arse mat break your fall? - Help me up. Honestly, I don't get it! Neither do I. Why don't you listen, when I say this will end badly? Was your set that important for you? It's fucked. It's pointless talking about it. I might have an idea. Give me a cigarette. Good evening. I want to apologise for what happened earlier. We're gonna have to improvise but we'll do our best. Message to another me. I know you hear me; I know you see me. Yeesss.... Don't you want to try? - I don't know. - Wanna try? - Okay. - Trust me. You'll look fantastic. Don't move. Stop it. There's loads here. Have you finished? It's great. Here. "Message to another me. "I know you hear me; I know you see me." You're taking the piss, right? No. It was really good. Fuck! Our cousin's changed! Hasn't he just. So, what's your plan? You gonna come to family events like this, in high heels and makeup? Your turn. If you like. There we go. That way, you'll be one of us too. Shut the fuck up. Subtitles: Lisa Cizo Subtitling TITRAFILM
