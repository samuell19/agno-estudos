This should work for you now. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I knew this would work out. Sometimes you get a feeling, you know? About people. Right, of course, OK. Hit me with it. What's the damage? Just call it $50. Come on. People on the boards? They talk. Chat rooms are like sewing circles. What if they found out, me, taking advantage of an artist... A hundred. ...such as yourself. A hundred. I'm going to give you $500. This one's dead. Got one I can... I've got to have it. - Name your price. - It's not for sale. Uses high bias audio tapes, right? How's the resolution? For a while, I felt like I was in freefall, stuck in the grips of a dream I couldn't wake up from. There were days when I could feel myself slipping, like the sidewalks and the people weren't really there at all. Just figments. It didn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. So, I've learned it's what I understand now. There is no sense to be made. Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough. Can I ask you a question? Oh, no. Did he leave you anything? A note? For a long time I was convinced I just couldn't find it. It would appear in a place I looked 100 times and explain everything. It never did. I'm sorry. It gets easier. What does that mean? Nothing. I suppose it's just a thing people say. Meaningless. This is Chicago. It is the city of the Magnificent Mile. It is the city of the Chicago Cubs and beautiful Wrigley Field. It is a city known for its heated political debates. We really ought to have as free of market as you can, and it's become such a costly area of pursuit. And with that, you have involvement of a number of local governments. There is need for, I think, a minimal amount of governmental... What the fuck? ...make sure that there's stability. Who is responsible for last night's act of video piracy? These video pirates interrupted programming with a show of their own. Last night, someone broke into regular programming here on channel... Someone using sophisticated equipment managed to briefly and illegally override broadcast... The incident is now under investigation by the FCC and the FBI. When this person is caught, he or she will face both civil and criminal penalties. ...while the FCC says last night's piracy was the first of its kind. A week later, the video pirates struck again. This time, the target was a WTTP broadcast of syndicated science fiction series, "Don Cronos." But this time, what they should showed viewers was somehow even more bizarre. You need this for your archive? Yeah. May 10th, '87, 11 to midnight, "Don Cronos." All right, yeah. Um, you want to just call back? Or do you mind holding? No, no, no. I'll hold. Uh, hey, you still there? Hello? Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm here. You know, looking at the log here, it seems you're not the first person to inquire about this specific tape. In fact, we've gotten several phone calls in just the last... Do you have it? Yeah, no. That specific tape is confiscated by the FCC. The computer says I'm supposed to flag any request for it and report them immediately to the FBI. Think, think, think. Who would...? Yeah. Yeah, uh, Chester. This is James. Yes, I'm the guy... I'm the guy who fixed your Leica III. Betamax? Actually, much better quality than VHS. I know, I... I just... I can't... I figured as much. That's why I brought mine. This is the most incredible feeling, seeing her again. Cyrus, you're a scientist. A scientist deals in established principle and fact. One thing we have to accept is that death is the end. What do you mean by that? You've been working yourself too hard. - You... - No, no. Just wait, just wait. ...locked in this laboratory for over a year. Whatever you're doing, it can't be worth your health and your peace of mind. It might even damage your mind. Nothing is more... You've become obsessed by a purely private, impractical idea. Assumed that's why you wanted to see this? What do you know about this? The Sal-E Sparks incident? Only the creepiest unsolved mystery hack of all time. Who's Sal-E Sparks? From "StepBot." You know, the 80s sitcom? Right. The one with the... Widowed robotics engineer who invents an android wife to take care of his five adopted kids. It's actually S-A-L dash E. Sal-E Sparks. "System Analytic Lifeform Emulation." Giving androids idiotic anagrams was all the rage for a while. But, yeah, that's the inspiration for the... It. 15 years later and they still never got the hackers who pulled it off, though some compelling theories have been floated across the boards. The Chicago BBS boards? Mm-hmm. So, that means this tape is very valuable. One of the only first Gen copies out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have cash. I don't take money from friends. What if we made a trade instead? Listen, I can see this has a lot of sentimental value for you, so... Tell you what, I am going to throw in the Betamax player, free of charge. That's very generous of you. I have another, better one at home. So, what happened? She dump you? Yeah, I got to get to work, OK? Right, of course. OK. I'd like you to meet Rotagrid. It stands for "Random Output Terminal Analytic Gateway Remote Interconnected Data Grid." This is the Nite Pirate. Don't believe the lies. So, you want to know about the Chicago broadcast intrusions? If you're expecting me to have the FBI report, I'll tell you the same thing I told the last fellow who came here asking for it. Was it MacktheKnife69? That's his BBS handle. I don't know his real name. Be careful what you read in those chat rooms, Mr., um... James. Well, James, the only way I could gain access to such a report is the same method as you or any other citizen. File a FOIA request, sit by the mailbox and wait. FOIA. Freedom of Information Act? Though with their massive volumes and, shall we say, limited resources, you can expect a response time between six months and never. So... No. I don't have it. But in service of curious minds such as yours, vulnerable to gossip and rumor on the internet, I'm happy to provide you with a more informed viewpoint. Broadcast intrusions are a rare cultural phenomenon. In 40 years of broadcasting, there have been less than 10. The two intrusions here in Chicago. The Sal-E Sparks incident. The only two cases that remain unsolved to this day. Yeah, the tapes I saw were... Gets under your skin, doesn't it? When the FCC reviewed the footage, they were at a loss. Nobody could quite work out what they were watching. Was it a joke? A prank? And that was in early '87. Yeah. Yeah, that was, uh... That was May 3rd. After the second incident a week later, the FBI got involved. Yeah, May 10th. Yes. Seven days in a week. Conspiracy theorists claim the FBI put pressure on the press not to widely report the incident, worried that media exposure might inadvertently be spreading a subliminal message. Well, what kind of message? Something glimpsed in the wallpaper, half-listened-to in the voices. Yeah, but it was just noise. Static. Certainly sounds like static, doesn't it? There were rumors of a third Sal-E Sparks intrusion years later. But by then we had all but given up on the investigation. Do you happen to have the date? The network? Well, there are conflicting reports as to which network, though if such a thing does exist, it may continue the pattern. Pattern? Each subsequent intrusion targeting a smaller audience, what is referred to as "narrowcasting." If it started with a network affiliate, followed by a Public Broadcasting station, it would stand to reason that the third one would most likely be... Cable access? Very good. I do happen to have a note here, a reference to the date. November 23rd, 1996. Though, I couldn't begin to tell you the source, probably because no tape has ever materialized and probably never will. Whoever was responsible... if indeed only one person was responsible... either died or disappeared. Oh. I can't tell what it is. The FBI doesn't close cases easily. And eventually, they realized they were climbing staircases to nowhere. ...Finally come to terms with the fact that it was not your fault. I knew that it would... It might come slowly. You know, I have this thing I have to go to... You know, this barbecue. People from work. Saturday. Thinking you could come with me? Be my date? Yeah. Yeah, me, too. They may be gone, but we're still here, you know? Come on, let's just enjoy that for once. Yeah, I'm just... I'm just swamped at work. Well, if you're ever bored and want to just hang out, rent a tape from Blockbuster, or whatever... I got to get... I got to get going. Thank you. Don't work too late. I fixed them. I fixed them all. James? It's a set. Like in a movie or in a theater. The walls are just panels. Somebody built this place. The windows, the carpets, the walls... that's why the figure seems so tall. It's like room within a room. Which begs the question... Why? Look. There's a face in the window. You've really taken these apart. He let himself be seen, look! Let me ask you a question. Why are you so curious about this? We had a years long investigation by both the FCC and the FBI. We turned up nothing. Not the first two incidents, yes. But you said so yourself that there was hardly any information about the third. Because there probably wasn't one. I mean, who knows how many people have seen it. You know, things like this, they don't happen by accident. There's always a reason. Never attribute conspiracy to that which is more appropriately labeled "coincidence." Look, I am telling you, they're connected. Look, somewhere, for some reason, this person wanted to say something to the world, and he chose this medium to do it. Say you're right, say someone did hide a message in those tapes. Do you really want to be the guy to figure out what that means? Yes. This is a federal crime, James. Whoever did this could still be out there. Exactly. Look, look, look, look. If you look closely... Look, I don't want you falling down a rabbit hole you can't climb out of. Be very careful, James. Some threads aren't worth picking at. "Drink tonight on me..." Fired by a fucking haiku. How old is she? She's... she's 16. And she'll be inside the house? No. No. Outside, on the street. Weight? Uh... How much does she weigh? Oh, um, um... One... 120. All right. I'll let you know what you need to do after. Right. Yeah. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. Come in. Sit down. So you came. Where did you get that? So? You said you can help me. In 1990, the FBI concluded an investigation into the Sal-e Sparks incident. I have access to their complete file. Unredacted. If you want it, it's yours. Look, I don't know how you knew about me, but I'm not exactly sure... Don't you want to know what happened to those girls? In both intrusions, a woman went missing just prior to the signal being hijacked. Yeah, I read about her, after you reached out to me. There's nothing that connects her to those tapes. Except that's not what you believe. How did you find me? Do you think you're the first person to have crossed me on this road? No. No, I know I'm not the first. But I'll be the last. Sometimes, in a situation like this, rooting around in the places that you've been rooting... Let's just say, anonymity can be a privilege. OK. Say I do want the file, then what? How much you want? Those keys make you feel safe? I have money. That's not how this works. Then what? A delivery. An address in Chinatown. A man will be waiting there for you. You give him the package and walk away. That's it? That's it. I'll know when you've done it. And if you don't. How do I know what you're offering me is real? Hmm? Useful? You don't. When it's done, you'll get the file. Things will be better for you if you don't know what's inside. What does that mean? Do you think there's a pattern? Do you think the tapes are trying to tell you something? They are. You're not going to find it, though. 11 years and all I got was dead ends. He hid himself well. You set me up. You set this up. You brought me here. Why? It's a warning for the curious. You discovered the women. Don't start this. You don't know what it does. You discovered the missing women. The women... fuck the women! I went to their families. Do you think they want to talk to people like us? You know what they think about people like us? You failed, but at least you tried. Stop. Before you realize you can't. It's too late. - They're everywhere, man. - What? Hello? I know what they mean. Who is this? It's me, it's James. James? Got a little worried about you. Are you listening? I was right. They're confessions. Chicago, May 2nd, 1987, girl goes missing, is never found. The day before the first intrusion. Same thing a week later. It all fits. James... This guy was kidnapping these women. He was... I heard about your wife. If I had known when you came to me, I... Look, I'm close. I know it. Grief can be a tricky thing, James. Look, I just wanted to thank you, OK? For all your help. Can I get a Rush, please? Shot of Wild Turkey. One for this guy, too. Thanks, but I'm good with beer. So why are you following me? Take a shot and I'll tell you. Fuck you. I'm not in college. If you want an answer to your question, you have to drink. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Fine. Research. I'm gathering material. For what? Take or leave it. Another round. I'm not sure yet. That's not an answer. Your turn. What's the real reason? OK. I like to follow people because it's something I can control. It's for myself. Get to have all the power. Like cutting, but without all the mess. Let's talk about you. Oh, that would probably be a bad idea. Doesn't mean it's not worth doing. Every idea I ever had was a bad one. What was her name? Mine was called Benjamin. I was 19. God, my mom hated me after that. She sent me letters all the time telling me. But, you know, who gives a shit, right? I was happy where I was. Yeah, and he just... He got me. Then what happened? Ugh, well, I should have left a long time before I did. The girls they found in his room were 14. Shit... But, you know, that was five years ago, yesterday. Five years, and now, I am here. Everything is fine. You seem lost. Maybe. At least seem drunk. Probably. One more round. You know, you sort of lied before. I did? Yeah, you said that every idea you've ever had was bad, but getting out of that situation, that was a good one. Yeah, well, I've made up for it since then. The name on my license ain't quite accurate. I'm just here because there's places I can't go back to. Same. Hannah. Her name was Hannah. Ugh. All right. Whoa! You weren't lying. You said there's more like this? Uh, there are three in total. I'm in an exhaustive search for the third. Need any help? Thanks, but I prefer to work alone. What do the numbers mean? What numbers? Seven digits. I guess it's a phone number? Trust me. If there were phone numbers on the tape I would have seen it. Did you hear it? Listen. Did you hear it? It's Morse code. Fuck me. Yeah, but who knows Morse code outside of sailors or telegraph operators? OK, sailor. What's the number? Let's make a deal. You let me crash here for a few days while I get back on my feet, and in return I will assist you. Oh, brother. In your investigation. Starting with this. OK, fine. Whatever. You want to call it? What happened to your phone? Oh, I had to destroy it. You never know who could be listening. Couldn't one just unplug a phone? Yeah, one would think. This for me? Hello? Fuck. James? You've been following me? You know they can track those. You shouldn't have those... It's a burner phone. Burn her! She's not going to be there when you need her. She's going to be against you. If you're going to do this, go all the way. Why don't you just... Follow the tapes. If you're going to do this, follow the tapes. The girls are a dead end. I wish I would have known that. It's all concentric fucking circles. I wish... I wish I fucking knew that! Why... why don't you just come upstairs? No, man. They're everywhere, man. What are you talking about? They're everywhere, man! I just need some fuckin' sleep. - We have to leave now. - What the fuck? - Just until it's safe. - What the fuck was that, James? Who the fuck was that? We need to go, we need to go. - Grab whatever you can. - And go where? Out of town. Anywhere. You heard what he said. Whoever followed him can follow us here. It's not safe, not anymore. We have to go, OK? Hey, OK? Ugh! We can't leave any evidence behind. It's not safe anymore. Let's go! The phone number from the tape is registered to a storage unit in Peoria. We leave now, we can get there by noon. OK. Wait here. I know how to work this guy. Give me five minutes. Do you have a phone? According to this, the unit was first rented in '87. Payment was set up as a standing order on a credit card, and paid every month without fail ever since. Has anyone come here to check on it? As far as I'm aware, no. I've been here for 10 years. To be honest, I figured that's why you were here. You're the only ones who ever asked about it. They never followed it this far. I need a name. Does it say who set up that standing order? That I can't tell you, legally. You know? Hello? It's for you. If you'll excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me. Apologies, I didn't get your name. Alice. This is James. Sorry I was rude back there. Stephen Meyer. Nice to meet you, Stephen. Um, we actually have to head... No, Stephen Meyer. The name on the rental unit. Oh. Is that with a V or P-H? P-H. M-E-Y-E-R. Address is a PO box in Joliet. That should get you to him, at least. I always, uh, wondered about that, you know? Here. Here it is, right here, on the back of my personal card. I'm Brad, by the way. Thanks, Brad. Left side, third one from the top. Now we wait for Stephen Meyer. Pray to God he checks his mail. Is this all right? Mm-hmm. So, what do you do for fun, Jimmy? Um... I mean, do you have any hobbies? Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a ton of stuff I like to do. Yeah? Like what? I fix old cameras. That's one. It doesn't really count as a hobby if you get paid for it. What else? I'm into photography. It's the same thing. Dude, you really need to broaden your horizons. When I was a kid, I used to make these little radio shows in my bedroom. I'd record them on this little boombox, and then I would hide them in the yard so people passing by I could listen. Nobody ever did, but I kept on making them anyways. Funny. Things we remember. Yeah, I've been at this for weeks. It feels like forever. I can't seem to remember anything from before, I swear. Before when I started. Well, sometimes you spend so long looking for the answers, you forget the fucking question. I don't know if she died. What? I wasn't there when she died. No real memories. Pictures in my head. Abandoned car. Skyway Bridge. Empty casket. God damn it, Stephen Meyers, pick up your fucking mail. Stephen Meyer? We need to talk to you. We found your storage unit in Peoria. Follow me. We're here about the storage unit. OK. Your name's on the account. We're not cops. I need to know why. When I was a kid, I had a stammer. You know what a stammer is? Well, it... you know, it's not a good thing, especially when you're a kid. Things might have changed, but, you know, I turned 15 in '87, and all I knew was that it was hard to make friends when you couldn't ask a kid his name without the words being stuck in your throat. Of course, one thing I did have was the bulletin boards. There were like a dream, you know, a bunch of outcast kids bullshittin' about phone hacking and old cartoons. And the best part is, nobody can hear a stammer when you type. And these boards were lit up with guys who could break into just about any damn line in the country. They called it "phreaking," with a P-H. And these... these phreakers, they could be, uh... Well, they were an intense bunch. So, I remember one day, about a year earlier in '86, the boards had lit up like I'd never seen them before. I think we all knew about that Nite Pirate hijacking that signal in Florida long before the fucking cops did. That was beautiful. The rumors. People either shooting it down as bullshit or claiming they were responsible. I didn't actually see a tape until early the next year. OK? I got some kid in Tallahassee to send it to me. Some kid just like me. Lonely, isolated, you know? I must have watched that fucking tape 100 times, picking it apart, trying to figure out what it is, you know? What it meant. It was that month, in school, we were doing presentations on what we like to do outside of school. Hobbies and shit. So I took the Nite Pirate tape in, and I hooked up a VCR, and I went about teaching a room full of 14 year olds how to steal a television signal. Teacher was none too happy, but I don't remember tripping over my words even once. Growing up, my family, we never wanted for money, OK? OK? We were not rich, but we weren't poor either. You know? Like some of the other families I knew. But then there were the rich kids, all right? Confident, well-dressed... fuckin' aliens, as far as I was concerned. Most of them were older than me, but one of 'em must of had a brother in my class, told 'em about my presentation, because a few days later, a group of them... they cornered me. They had it in their heads that they wanted to hijack a signal, like in Florida. You know, make a tape, broadcast it, and did I know how to do it? I said, sure, I could do it. And not because I most definitely could, and not because I really kind of wanted to, but because they have this feel to them, you know? Like they could just turn on you at any moment. So they kicked your ass. They made you do it. No, you don't understand. They didn't lay a finger on me. They didn't have to, because they had money, OK? They talked to girls. It was exciting, all right? I felt like I was a part of something, and not just from the edges, like I was important. I could do something that nobody else could do and that was a currency. This wasn't just some schoolyard bullshit either. They wanted to know what kind of equipment we needed, how dangerous was it going to be, stuff like that. I never knew anyone else in my life who wanted to know about stuff like this, let alone somebody who had the means and the desire to actually power out a transmission tower. So, no, they didn't make me do it. I wanted to do it. What about the number? The Morse code? Why? It's kind of beautiful, how hard I worked, to make sure that the tape never looked back to us. But then, what's the point of fucking with people if there's no reward? So, numbers... The code, all of it, was my idea. Figured if I hid it well enough, planted a little seed on the boards, people would go nuts. So, a week before we stole the signal, I gathered up all the money they paid me, and took a bus to Peoria, and I set up shop. And I waited. You have no idea how long I waited. What was that? That is no concern of yours. James? You got everything you came for. James, we need to leave. You're lying. James! Why would I lie? No, your story does not make sense. I studied those tapes over and over. Whoever made them is not just responsible for powering out signals. You are out of your depth, my friend. Tell me about Frederica Sexton. I don't know who that is. You want answers, you have three tapes to find them in. Wait, what? - It's time that you should go. - No, no. - Three, you said three tapes. - I think you should... You said three tapes. Where? Think it's time for you to leave. I need that third tape. There's a knack to it. Fuck! Maybe he just wanted attention. No, no, no. Then why would he keep paying for it? Huh? After all these years, why would he keep it in a storage unit in another town if he just wanted to fuck with people, huh? He wanted to be found. Yeah, and you found him. You tracked him down and he told you his story. You fucking did it. I mean, it's been a crazy ride. But it's over now, you know? You can let it go. Are you... what are you out of your fuckin' mind? Not even close! Not until I get my hands on that third tape! And I knew the moment I called him on it. Only thing out of his mouth that wasn't a total fucking lie. You believed him. His story. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just saying that, maybe, he was telling the truth. Maybe it was just a bunch of kids, you know? Fucking around. Or maybe it was all just bullshit. No! Dr. Lithgow. Yes? He couldn't have been, right? I mean, after all this... the whole time... was right under... James. It doesn't exist, right? The third tape. James, this has to stop. The pattern. Cable access, November 1996. Look, I need you... I need you to tell me, OK? Tell me it doesn't exist. It can't be real, can it? James, have you ever seen a 1983 Chevrolet Corvette? What? You haven't. There isn't one, because Chevy never sold an '83 model. Does that mean they don't exist? There were 43 prototype models made. Supposedly, they were all destroyed. Did any survive? Only a rabid 'vette enthusiast would know, and only they would have the will to keep searching for it. I... I don't understand. Public access channels don't archive their programs, and only someone with a vested interest would record one, so you tell me, James, does a third tape exist? If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. And get it off my shoulders. Say the things you used to say. And make the world go away. Do you remember when you loved me? Before the world took me astray. If you do then forgive me. And make the world go away. Make the world go away. And get it off my sh... What are you looking for? I'm sorry if I hurt you... I'll make it up day by day. Just say you love me like you used to. And make the world go away. Make the world go away. And get it off my shoulders. Say... My arm is hurt. I think you broke my arm. Shut up. This isn't right. This isn't right. I said be quiet! I didn't do that. That isn't me. You made that tape. November 21st, 1996. Why? I didn't do this. November 21st, 1996. Why? You aren't the police. You're not the police. Answer the fucking question! You're not the police! Frederica Sexton. She disappeared the day before the first signal intrusion. Marie Bedford left her boyfriend's house in Aurora the day before a WTPT TV signal was hijacked. Mmm, mmm, mmm. And then there was one more after that. And you're going to tell me why. My arm... I need to go to the hospital. Admit you took those women! You made those fucking tapes! I don't know who you are! You took her. - I... - Tell me... No. Tell me you did it. I don't know who you are. No! You took those women! You buried them in the dirt, and you thought no one would ever find you! But I found you. I connected the dots because I'm smarter than you. And I know what you did. What do you want from me? The set. Take me to the set. Take me to the set. Is it all here? I don't know. We need to rebuild it Why? We're going to make a tape. I missed my favorite show tonight. Can you guess what it is? Probably already know what it is. Bet it's your favorite show, too, right? Right? Please let me out. I haven't done anything. I don't want to be here anymore. Please? Please? When will dad be here? When will dad be here? No, no! No! Please! No! Read it. No. There's no other way. Please... This is the only way. This isn't... this isn't right. Read it! "My name is Michael Gardner, and between 1987 and 1996, I hijacked the signals at three television stations. I did this because I..." I can't. I know... It's the only way you'll be free. No. I won't do this. Please. Read the fucking script! "I did this because... because I needed to tell the world about what I did, what I did to these women, to the women I took. The intrusions are confess..." Please, please, please. The sooner you read it, the sooner you will understand... The sooner you'll find peace. Promise? I promise. "The intrusions are confessions, confessions that I took these women. That I killed them. I fixed them. I fixed them all. And this is my punishment." One thing we have to accept is that death is the end. Whatever you're doing, it can't be worth your health and your peace of mind. It might even damage your mind. You know nothing of... Fuck!
