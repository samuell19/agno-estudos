Shut that thing off, Pops! You could close that door, you know, miss? Later you'll go around blaming others. And you could stop staring like a loon! Heh! It's occupied again. Who's in there, dear? A vampire? It's not a vampire, it's your son. The kid's hurrying to an exam. - It's me, Dad, jeez. What is it? - I take it you need to shave right at this moment? - I do. - Do you? Right when I'm going to work, huh? I've got a midterm. If you didn't show up for a midterm, son, nobody would even notice, but if I'm late for work, they'll deduct 10% from my wages! As if they haven't deducted enough... As if they haven't deducted enough! For earthquakes, floods, droughts, not to mention the loans! Goddamn! It's that old spinster, she dropped in behind my back. You don't say? And how can I be old at thirty years of age? Well, excuse you, but you can't be young either. You've gone past your sell-by date. And how can you be a junior clerk at 56? What kind of miracle is that? Well, for God's sake, can't we agree for once about who gets to piss first in this house? And so starts the morning schizophrenia... I'd prefer it if you helped a bit instead of just staring at those papers all day. Not even God can help you at this point. Everyone's given up on you. - Oh, it's you. - What, do you want me to piss myself? Well, can't a man with a ruined bladder get to go first in this house? Give me some money, and you can go in as often as you like. Money again? What for? - For a new English textbook. - And what's wrong with the old one? Well, it's falling apart. - So what if it's falling apart? - I'm buying books at the flea market. Greasy, torn, no covers. And look at my compass. I'd fail to stab an ox with it! And I'm gonna fail English. There's no joking with the Jap. F straight away. What, you've got Japanese people teaching you English now? - Nah, he isn't really Japanese. - Nothing's real these days. Everything's plastic. Fake! Just stop complaining and give him the money. How's he going to study without a book? And how did Maxim Gorky use to study? I forgot how he used to study! In front of the stove, I've forgotten even my grandad Maxim, let alone Maxim Gorky. You lot have forgotten a lot. He didn't even have a candle! He sat in the moonlight, with a pot, like this! He stole and rented books to educate himself! Give me that pot and stop talking nonsense. He rose to the top without so much as a penny! Where did I go wrong with my life? Oh, for fuck's sake... If you're on your period, miss, you might want to put a note on the door so we know! I'm here, Mr Pantic. Your daughter's inside. And with a father like you, I wouldn't be surprised if she menopaused prematurely. What, she's woken up as well? The toilets in this house are like at a bloody train station. I don't need her getting up early as well. Budge up! - Sign here, Pops. - And why should she get up early? She can go look for a job later. It's not like she's going to find it, anyway. She's just wasting my time here. Why are you in such a rush, Dad? Chill out a little. - Have some coffee. - Hm! Son, you only need to pay attention to lost years, but for me every minute counts! I've never seen someone so afraid of their boss. - Where's your dignity? - It's fucked off. This is his Lord's Prayer. In my day, everything was in order. Both at the table and in the toilet. - Well, where do I sign? - Right here, Pops. - You don't even know what you're signing. - It's better that I don't. Some penalty, yeah? Right. Look, another reprimand. Why? - For having a nice-looking book like this. Now give me the money. - Oh, for fuck's sake... - Stop swearing at the table! - Well, he caught me off-guard! I haven't got time to argue! What should you argue for? Give him the money and go, already! All my friends get pocket money. I'm the only one who has to sneak into the cinema every time. - Good God, come out already! - What is it, Daddy? Well, what in God's name are you doing in there?! - Checking my lousy cosmetics. - Lousy? Everything's empty. I've got to refill. Look... You've gotta give me money if you want me to get a job. Money? What do you need money for? - I've given you a degree in Law! - A degree isn't enough. They don't look at that anymore. - Then what do they look at? - Legs, Dad. Embonpoint... - Image is important. - What image?! Appearance. You know the class of chicks that comes there? Boots up to here. Up to here! They're all sparkly, and look at me. Soon I won't have anything to draw my eyebrows with! And why did you have to remove them? Your eyebrows were nice, like a monkey's! - You should be ashamed, Dad. - I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed! I'm just a junior clerk, son, I haven't got money for that! Well, it's not exactly normal to be a junior clerk at age 56. That's just a name, you moron. It's a title, a title! Well, what a title! Well done! And you should talk? How about yours? "Eternal Astronomy Undergraduate"? If you're a junior clerk, I wonder what the senior ones look like? They look like you, except their tongues are shorter and their hair is combed. Oh, Dad! What, 'Oh, Dad'? Man, do you know what you're like on the street? On the street you're a gentleman and a half. You strut around with dignity, like you invented the telephone or alternating current. And then when you come home, you want to strangle us for two cents. - What if I asked for a Honda? - What Honda? Even a secondhand one. Everyone's riding something these days. At first I thought I'd piss myself, but now I feel something worse coming on! Something much worse! You're just wasting my time. What now? What I am going to do now? - Now you're going to have some coffee. - And cross yourself. - Cross myself? - Si. Then you'll see how nice your day will be. And then? Then you light a cigarette, calmly. Yeah? Then you drink your cup of coffee, calmly. You shouldn't scramble around that much. Work isn't a rabbit. It's not going to run away. My job won't run away, but I will! Oh, no you don't. You've made your bed, now you're going to have to lie in it. And give me two grand. I ask for nothing but a bit of respect, minimum. And I want at least three grand. I've made my bed, and I'm going to lie in it, but the excess I'm going to throw out. And you, miss, are the straw that will eventually break my back. Even if you cut your wrists because nobody wants you, you'd have bled out by now. Life isn't easy for her, either. If someone just wanted to marry her... There aren't any more fools like that. You can't marry or move out a state-appointed subtenant, you can only carry her out legs-first. Oh, God forbid. And who makes laws like that? They protect eagles, bears, subtenants... Animals and reptiles of all kinds are protected, only the honest man is abused by everyone as they see fit. Of course. But miss... Not even the law is all-powerful. Even thought they're protected, eagles, bears, and mongooses are going extinct. Your species is bound to vanish as well! You'll disappear just like the dinosaurs!

And what do you want to know? I want to know when you intend to start working. What have we got? - Like last time, you need to copy the invoices. - I knew it. I hate invoices more than anything. I hate the rest, too, but invoices drive me crazy. Ow... There goes the nail. I have to cut all my nails, like I'm working at a threshing machine. Well, madam, they don't hire made-up tarts at threshing machines, either. Well, what are you doing? Can't you see I'm untangling the ribbon? Well, what am I supposed to do while you're untangling? You can order me coffee, if you're a gentleman. Until I wash up. When you wash up, you can go to the boss' office. You'll get coffee there, too. A farewell coffee, I hope. Ms. Melita, explain to the chairman. - Mileta? - Melita Sandic. I didn't seen you in company until now. I'm new. - New? - Yes, third month. Third month? It seems the lady isn't quite in love with her job. - Some job... - And I suppose you have a better one? - I'm searching, comrade. I'm searching. - You're searching? You hardly began work, and you're already looking for a new job? A better one, comrade. A better one. - On the side? - Comrade chairman, I'm learning Spanish, Esperanto, and stenography. I know Italian already. But you don't know how to type. Wait a moment, Pantic... Well, comrade chairman, all those invoices you tore up were typed by her. Just a second, Pantic. Comrade chairman, how can I fulfill the work standard and earn my measly income? Mine is even measlier. Even the measliest income has to be earned... with hard work! Maybe he does, but I don't. How am I supposed to work a job where I am not exploited enough? If you have objection, just write. We consider. - We consider. - And what am I supposed to do? Calm yourself, Pantic! Intrahuman relations is not solved with insulting! How am I supposed to calm down? I can't calm down! If you can't calm down, then go out! Then you can shout outside. If my wife Lepa Sojic is here, I want her to raise hand. Why you no answer phone? Listen, I have to take you car. Let's not arguing. You got our old Fiat, you can go around in that one. I can't go with business partner in Fiat. Where's the key? Hey! We not at home! What's wrong with you? Let go of my bag, you idiot! Who let this cretin in here?! Get lost, you barbarian! You thief! W-Well, this not my wife! What are you doing, man? Who are you, anyway?! - Lady, I was... - Out, you hayseed! Get out! I was call for my wife Lepa Sojic. You raise your hand! I raised my hand to tell you to get lost! What's the matter? Who let an unknown man in here? I asked the lady to... I asked you to go in here and looking for my wife. You no want! I've got better things to do than to worry about your wife. Get out immediately! Can't you see that he's ruined my mask?! Madam, I will going out. But you must know that I am supperised. And offensed. The Jap is coming! Monitor... I suppose you're blind? This bin doesn't bother you at all, hmm? "Absent?" Petrovic, Savic, Ristic... And why is the blackboard not clean? - I'm on it. - When?! - When I gather this up. You were supposed to do that while I was in the staff room, clean the blackboard as I was walking up the stairs, so as soon as I walk in... I can take the chalk and start working. Except the chalk is broken and dull. We're wasting time here! Go to your seat! I can't work with you at all like this, you know that? If the Japanese acted like this, what do you think would happen to them? - They'd ruin themselves. - Exactly. They've got no arable land, no resources. They sit on each other's heads. They lost the war, but they haven't lost what? Time, I think. Correct. The Japanese youth don't play with Rubik's Cubes, they don't trade football stickers. The Japanese youth don't shout and don't spit in the corridors. The ill don't take sick leave, the tired don't go on holiday, the Japanese work and work and work! So in Japan, the blackboards are clean and the chalk is sharpened. But I've wasted almost six minutes here. Jovanovic! Professor, I can't do the oral today because [gibberish]... ...that's why I went to [gibberish] and they told me to [gibberish], so I really can't, [gibberish]. Jovanovic! You should go throu-- I mean, when you [gibberish]... ...we could [gibberish] Kalemegdan [gibberish], so we'll start there. Yeah? What? Out. - Wait, Professor, I didn't [gibberish]... - Get out! [Gibberish.] Draskovic! - What's wrong with you? - Hypertension. Blood pressure. - How high? - 180/120. - At 16 years old? - I weigh more than 100 kilos. Unbelievable. This is impossible. It's impossible that nobody in this class is healthy. You look completely healthy to me, just a bit chubby and red. Get up here. Who's bawling over there? Me. Can you maybe stop? Get out. Out! Go cry in the psychologist's office! That's unnatural, that's completely absurd. Right? As for you, open the book. "Jenny Kiss'd Me", page 28. Let's go. "Jenny kiss'd me when we met..." "JeNnY kIsSeD mE wHeN wE mEt, JuMpInG fRoM tHe ChAiR sHe SaT iN..." - Go on. - "TiMe, YoU tHiEf, WhO lOvEs To GeT..." "...SwEeTs In YoUr LiSt, PuT tHaT iN!" Couldn't you do that a little better? Hey, I'm not Japanese. To your seat! You're not Japanese, eh? Milica Knezevic! - Where is Knezevic? - In the hall. - What is she doing out there? - She's crying. You just threw her out. Dacic! I'm absent. You're absent? And have you been reported? Is Dacic reported as absent? She is. Is she? Savic, Petrovic... Wrong. Dacic isn't reported as absent. Why hasn't Dacic been reported? You even lie that you've reported her! Listen, I want to see your father. I've been looking at you long enough. I want to look at him for a while now. Are we clear on that? So the two of us can have a little chat. Are we clear? Yes. Where are you going? I'm looking for Suzana. - And me? What am I around here? - No idea, ma'am. Eh, well, you can't pass without my permission. - I've visited here once before. - Well, tough luck, you won't anymore. - Is that so? - Indeed. - Then you're going to have to give her the photos. - What photos? Have a look. Nothing but legs and bare arses! Well, that's what they asked for. Shame on you. What's wrong? It's for a competition. And the head? Where is her head? The head? We don't need it. - We cut off the head. - Cut off? They should cut off yours. They don't need the head, madam. Just the legs. Just the legs, huh? Just the legs?! You creep! - What's wrong with you? - Just the legs?! You faggot! Get out! - You old hag! - Get out! Shame on you! - Was someone looking for me? - They were. Some scumbag pervert. Everyone's a scumbag to you. And stop scaring my acquaintances and throwing them out. Oh, what an acquaintance! Congratulations. Gorges himself like a pig for forty-odd years, then puts his obese arse into jeans, and then goes around like "I'm looking for Ms. Suzana!" Fuck off! - What is this supposed to mean? - He left those for your passport. How dare you? Who gave you permission to open my pictures? Oh, just for that, I'm going to sue you. And for scaring away my acquaintances! When some honest man visits intending to propose to you, take you by the hand, lead you to the altar, and carry you the fuck out of here, then I'll let him in. The others get the broom! Altar! What are you babbling about? I'm doing advertisements for female stockings. Is there something wrong with that? Just the arse and the legs... And I suppose yours are better? Maybe they can take some photos and put them on the front page. I've already been on the front page, back when I didn't dream that people like you would come to be! Except they took pictures of my head. The face was important to us. One day they'll take pictures of my face, too, madam! Oh, I'm sure! These days you have to reach the face by detour. It's long way from the arse to the head, miss. Grandma, the ways of today are all very complex and tangled. Anything to eat? She doesn't know where her arse or her head is. Right. Afternoon. Here's the spigot you asked for... Bread, washing powder, butter, soap, mothballs, dishcloth, and... ...meat. And all in the same bag? For God's sake, Mita. Now the bread smells like soap, the butter smells of washing powder, and all of it stinks of naphthalene! Where's the meat here? I can only see bone. Mum, you said that you can do without meat, but not without cigarettes! I can do without bones, but not without cigarettes! Well, there's no cigarettes until the first. I took 100,000 with me and look what's left! You don't even know how to bargain, son. When I used to go to the market, I could bring 100,000 with me, buy a whole pig, some cabbage, a jar, a broom, return by cab, and still have some money left for cigarettes! - Well, that market's gone to shit now. - How? It took that very cab, straight to shit. Well, it seems it won't be long before we all take that cab to shit. - Who's in there again? - Mira! - What's she doing? - Crying. Heh! Crying! Calm down, folks. My hands are shaking because of you, I can't work properly. You hear that astronomer? His hands are shaking and he's still in college. It's no wonder with a father like that. Look! You messed up again! Why in God's name did you buy a spigot? And what was I supposed to buy? - A hose for the washing machine. - Says who? Says me! I'm always talking and you never listen. Branko! Do you remember what I was supposed to buy? Tracing paper. Tracing paper? Hm! That's right. I told you ten times. A compass, markers, tracing paper... I need all of that. - Sida? - What? You've given birth to an idiot. Who do you mean? Branko, Mira, or Aca? I mean Branko. Tracing paper, Dad. I don't have anything to draw on! What am I supposed to do with this case, play it? We haven't got toilet paper, either. You father's buying betting tickets. He doesn't care if I don't have anything to wipe myself with. Take this and wipe youself. With half a roll? When he wins at sports betting, maybe he'll buy us another roll. What? What are you crying for now? Nothing, I just feel like going mad. Mad? Sida, what's with her? She failed again. This is the eighth interview this year! You've gone completely mad, huh? Well, does this country need lawyers or not? Soon every Yugoslav will have his own lawyer. - What do you mean? - Like how in America, everyone has their own psychiatrist. Hm! Seems you'll need both. They only accept men, they told me to get married. I told you to get married as well, and I told that dunce to graduate, but it seems you mixed those up! What you want from me? Mils. - What mills? - Two or three million. There's no use for a degree or makeup anymore, Daddy, without two-three mil you get nothing! These days you need to buy a workplace, in case you don't know. - Sida! - What? It seems you've given birth to two idiots. When they were kids and couldn't talk, I understood them perfectly well, now they talk their heads off and I don't understand a thing. Not a thing! The Jap wants to see you, Pops. First you say 'Good afternoon'. Now, what Jap? My homeroom teacher. Why me? He says that he's looked at me enough. Now he wants to see you. Me? Heh heh! You hear that? I swear I'm going to disappear one day. Not even Interpol will be able to find me! - What have you done now? - I didn't report this Dacic girl. - And why didn't you? - Because she was present. And why should you report her if she's present? Because she said that she's absent. - She said so? - Yeah. That Dacic girl. - And now the Jap wants to see me, eh? - Yes, you in particular. - Sida?! - What? You've given birth to three idiots. All three are idiots! I'd rather say that I married an idiot. This many idiots and so little space. That can't be good. "Jenny kiss'd me... when we, uh... m-met..." "Jumping... from the... chair she sat in..." "Time... you thief loves... to get... sweets in your, uh, list..." "Put that... in." "Who", "when", "kiss". There's no need to stretch it out. The efficiency of a civilisation is reflected in the language: clear and concise! "Hat, boot, get, bud, jet, let..." The shorter the better. You know? Translate it. Jenny kissed me, uh... jumping from the chair in which... in which she was sitting... ...when we, uh, met. Time... you thief who steals nice things for your list, er... write that down. I'll write something down in my list, and it's an F. Please not today, professor. - What's today? - A holiday. A holiday? What holiday? It's his birthday. New Year, Mothers' Day, Labour Day, the 4th of July, the 29th of November, and now his birthday, too? Well, you kids are just bound to fail. In Japan, they have just one holiday, and even then, they work! How is this country going to look when you take responsibility for it? All around... Paper... Rubbish... And boxes. Who's the monitor? What is this? Rubbish. And why is this rubbish not picked up? I don't know. Do you know what they do with rubbish in developed countries? - You mean, in Japan? - Yes, I mean in Japan. - They gather it. - They gather it. And then they recycle it into food. Yes, yes, the Japanese eat this. All this rubbish you scatter around, stomp, and tread on. God knows what you're going to eat when you grow up. It's better to starve than to eat that rubbish. Well then, wise guy, why don't you get up in front of the board? I think that would be for the best. - Dictionary. - Dictionary? I told everyone to write down new words into a notebook. - Window. - Excuse me? What is the English word for window? "Vindov." "Window", my friend. You put your mouth in a 'U' position, but you say 'V'. "Window." "Window." - Hat. - Excuse me? You'll be excused once we finish. Hat. "Haht." "Hat." "Hat." You put your mouth in an 'A' position, but you say 'E'. "Hat." "Hat." Right. Now, the article "the"? Remember: "The." [Noise.] "The." "The." [Noise.] You put your mouth in a 'D' position, but you say 'T'. "The." [Noise.] Okay. Fog. Uh... "Pig." "Pig" means pig. "Fog" means fog. And you are a charlatan. You're writing down the same words. Hats, fog, and pigs everywhere. On every page, there's one pig! Did you tell your father I want to see him? - I did. - And what did he say? He said I'm an idiot. Well, maybe he was right. Look... Another window! How do you say window? - "Window." - "The window!" "De window." "The." "The." Put your tongue between your teeth, like that. A bit higher. That's it. He's sticking his tongue out at me! Either that or he's having a stroke. Look at that. He's making fun of me! Go get your report card, and I'll go call your father personally to speak with him. Pantic Dimitrije. Alright, what is this? Where's my salary? At the end. This? And where's the rest? Where's my personal income gone, woman? Comrade, you've got everything written there. All the deductions are on the track. Loan... More loans, fine... Syndicate, fine... Flood, earthquakes, fine... Voluntary tax, fi-- What's this? Pardon my French, but what is this fuckery with 70,000? Go ask Pajkovic. - Pajkovic? - Yes, Pajkovic. Pajkovic! 'Ask Comrade Pajkovic!' Let's go ask Comrade Pajkovic! Comrade Pajkovic, what is this? Seven 12-minute tardinesses, plus one 90-minute tardiness. - Ninety... And that costs 70,000? - Easy, Pantic. Oh, in the name of... Jesus, Pajkovic, you know you're worse than a landslide, an earthquake, and a flood put together? Insult me all you want, Pantic. I've become completely numb to it. I see that you've become numb. I've got to turn a new leaf, Pajkovic! I've got to start silently beating the crap out of you! Don't you see the track's getting longer and longer, and when I get to the end there's nothing, Pajkovic? And the prices are going up, Pajkovic! Can we let this happen, Pajkovic? We can't. That's why we're upping the standard of workplace discipline. Up the standard, he says... Thanks. He comes on time and then spends his time solving crossword puzzles. And the ladies just gossip around the office instead of working. The chairman, of course, comes to work at noon. 820,000... I gotta work for this? I worked this amount off last Thursday, so now I'm free to fill out my betting tickets. And to tell you the truth, I don't give a flying fuck about their productivity. - 'Cause you can't live off your salary, right? - Right. How long can I last at 820,000 a month? Ten days, tops. And from the tenth to the first, how much do you think I need? - No idea. - Nor me, but I'd say... Two, two and a half million, and that's a bare minimum. Rounded up, let's say three. No need to round it up when I have nowhere to find that kind of money. Look, this is my maximum. Nine hits. I always get to nine, and then I cock up. - And who in their right mind would give me 3 mil? - I would. - You would? Heh! Well, I think two is quite enough, but if you say three, let's not argue. - Excuse me, but who are you? - Nedeljkovic. Oliver Nedeljkovic. - How did you get in here? - Me? Through the door. - And why would you give me that money? - 'Cause I got it. Just flew in from Germany, got money to burn, but no job. Capiche? You don't say? So, you want me to give you a job? Hey, not at all, not at all! I just don't want you to hit the brakes. I heard that you work with some Jovic? He's a good-for-nothing nobody. But me... I'm a man who should probably be thinking of retirement by now. And you think that I'm worth a lousy three million? More is out of the question, sorry. There are other members of the board. There are other members of the board. Think about it. You got no money, I got no job. Ya get me? And remember: Nedeljkovic. Oliver Nedeljkovic. One moment. Just a moment, please. We need discuss like a business people. Not like this, not like this. Not by wire. We can meet at diner, have a snack, a drink... Deal! Deal! Wait a moment, Pantic. Hello? Sojic on the phone. Listen, I said before. If you no want to take our coolers, no coffee for you. Nothing. You no have to cooperate no more. Someone else will. Someone else will. What is it, Pantic? Nedeljkovic Oliver. Remember that name. - What about it? - He must not pass. What must not pass? Well, he applied for a workplace. Remember, Sojic, he must not pass. What, due to labour? What labour? He's going to have baby? Oliver, Sojic. He's a man, there's no baby. Then why he should not pass? Because he offer me a bribe. What you say? Comes straight into my office smoking a cigar, and makes an offer. How much? - Three mil. Three mllion, Sojic, can you imagine? - I'm imagining it. Says he's got money to burn. And he goes to you in particular... And he also said that I asked for the most. - Among who? - Among other members of the board. - How is his name again? - Nedeljkovic Oliver. Oliver. Oliver. Well, did he left a phone number? Some note...? Advance payment or something? No, no. He left before I came to my senses. He did a bunk, if you'll pardon the expression. It's good, Pantic, that you informed me... I realised that it's my duty... Correct. What is important, Pantic, is that you is clean. Peaceful sleep is the most important thing in life. The highest number of goals was scored at the Dinamo vs. Zagreb match... Time, you thief, who love to get Sweets into your list, put that in! Say I'm weary, say I'm sad, Say that health and wealth have miss'd me... Shut it! ...say I'm growing old, but add, Jenny kiss'd me. - Jenny who? - Jenny Kissdme. - Branko? - Yeah? What does he want? He wants to deconcentrate me so I can screw up on my exam and fail! Time to eat! Wait a minute, what are you doing? - Move those lousy leaflets of yours. - Lousy? I've already got nine hits, in case you wanted to know. I don't want to know about your eternal nine hits. Call me when you get all 13 hits. Right now, you need to sign this hooligan's final reprimand. It better be the final one. The last one before expulsion. What'd you do this time, you brat? - He stuck his tongue out to the homeroom teacher. - Beautiful. I didn't stick my tongue out, it just dropped out. - Someone just came for the water bills. - I don't care. - They can't cut my water like electricity. - They'll come again. Mum, if that gangster comes again, throw him out. The match at Karaburma stadium is finished. The away team first took the lead with 1:0, the scorer was Amersek from the penalty spot, only for Majstorovic to equalise the score. - OFK Beograd vs. Olimpija, 1:1. - OFK-Olimpija, 1:1. 1:1... So zero, that means zero... It's a zero... I've got ten hits. Ten hits. Branko! What do they give for ten hits? Commendation, granny. - Commendation, granny. - Commendation? What about money? Money? Only with 12 hits, granny. Ten hits, people. You hear that? Ten hits, and three more matches to go! And have you heard that you've got a son whose tongue drops out regularly? What happened? Answer me, are you having a stroke? How did your tongue drop out? - During an oral exam. - Ugh, I feel like my tongue's about to drop out. While signing one of your penalties, it's just gonna hit me, and I'll stick my tongue out like... ...and just croak and fall down in front of everyone. Look at him, going nuts because of his miserable ten hits. Sarajevo... One. One! It's a one! Eleven hits. Eleven hits! Are we sitting down for lunch or not? How can I have lunch at a time like this?! How much money is it, Branko? Loose change, grandma. And that's assuming nobody gets 13. Well, lunch it is, then. Jesus Christ. The people I live with... Look, his tongue's dropping out, too! You just watch yours. One in Nis, people. One in Nis! It's twelve! I've got 12 hits! And with 12, Aca? How much? You can't tell for sure, granny. It could be a lot. Quiet, there! They're still playing in Tuzla. I've got chance for 13, Branko. Thirteen! Let me see, Dad. 8 minutes left. If they score, he'll have 13 hits! - Well, I'll be damned! - What does that mean, son? What's going to happen then? Then, granny, he's going to have a heart attack. Aca, can this piece of shit go any louder? It can't. Look, I haven't got patience for this. You listen in and tell me what happens. - Goal! - Goal?! - No, they hit the woodwork. - Oh, God dammit. Tell me what he's saying, man. What is he saying?! He says... "Never worry, never stress, take a drink of Kras Express!" I'll be in bathroom, you inform me. Well, I'll be... Hey, calm down, Dad. Your heart's gonna stop! Twelve is enough. It's not enough. It's not enough! There's bound to be another wretch with twelve hits like me! I need thirteen. Thirteen, man! Six minutes left. Those bellends are playing on the home field, and they can't even score a single goal! Hit the woodwork again. What about 13, my boy? How much money is that? - Last week some guy took 650 million. - Eh? 650 million! What's wrong? Four minutes left! Call the doctor, man! She's ill! What's wrong, Mum? - Should I call a doctor? - A priest. A priest? - Penalty! - For whom? A priest! - Call a priest! - What priest? An Orthodox one! - Everyone is in the penalty area! - Move! - Oh, what the hell is this?! - They cut your electricity! - There he is, Pops! - Why are you shouting, you moron? Thieves! Cutthroats! Bastards! You chose today to cut off my electricity! If they score in Tuzla, I'll buy my own generator, then you can cut off my John Thomas if you like! I'd be a little bit more careful with that 'John Thomas', if I were you. A female child is listening to you. Please. Female child, my foot... - Excuse me, do you know what happened at the game? - What game? - Where's your transistor? - I forgot it in the office. Pop over to Maslakovic's place and bring it here. Excuse me, little lady, but do you know where Aleksandar Pantic "Aca" lives? Oh, Panta the Panther? First door on the left. - Branko? - What? Go out and find a field doctor, and if you happen to find out what's happening in Tuzla, tell me through the window. - Just one question... - Don't ask me anything, just go away. - Madam, I'm just wasting time here... - Everyone who comes here ends up wasting time. I've wasted 24 years here. I haven't collected a single memory for my old age, I have no pleasant moments to remember! - What's important is that you lived well. - I lived well? And, pray, what memories have I got? Memories from the spa in Niska Banja, from Vrnjacka Banja, from Mataruska Banja, from Soko Banja... I saved money for my whole life. I saved money for an entire century. Move, please. I saved money my whole life. I saved money for an entire century! Daddy, come here, it's the testament. Daddy, for God's sake, come here! What is it? I want to give a statement. I saved every single cent, I ate bones and porridge, smoked the most disgusting tobacco... - ...and what have I saved up? - Tell us, what? Nothing! What kind of bloody statement is that? For the papers! 650 million! For farce! For fucking about! For a bunch of nonsense! And when they come here, I'll tell them and I'll let the whole world know... ...what a load of bollocks it is! Is there someone here I can speak normally to? Come on in. Go on, sit down. Go on. The sound of Riblja Corba's "Good Morning" is in the air, but it's anything but a good morning in Tuzla. The Sloboda vs. Vardar match has ended with a score of 0:0. I wanted... to talk about little Aleksandar. The kid's unbalanced, scatter-brained, and a bit lost. Unbalanced like his father, lost like his mother. It seems I picked the wrong day to pay a visit. Oh, no, they're like this every day. And the old madam... I'd say she's dying. Very gradually, thirty years and counting. Are they missing something in their lives? - 9 square metres. - What 9 square metres? These ones. All this is yours? 9.40. Sorry. - This is you? - That's me when I wanted to be actress, and this one when I wanted to be ballerina, and the one down there is from when I was on television. I wanted to be a newsreader so badly. And that's yours, as well... I'm doing advertisements for stockings, so... Well, you aren't missing anything, quite obviously. What I'm missing isn't measured in square metres. Excuse me, miss! It's me. Uh, I just remembered you've got a transistor, so I thought you might know how it ended in Tuzla? Did he miss the goal? He didn't. He hit the goalpost! A draw! ♪ Good morning... "Jenny kiss'd me when we met," "Jumping from the chair she sat in;" "Time, you thief, who love to get" "Sweets into your list, put that in!" "Say I'm weary, say I'm sad," "Say that health and wealth have miss'd me," "Say I'm growing old, but add," "Jenny kiss'd me." Stop! Stop! That's not it. The spirit of language is hidden in the rhythm of the syllable, in the dynamic of the verse, in the conflict of poetic and phonetic accent. I don't hear that. You're missing what's most important. And what's the most important thing here? Well, uh, the most important thing is that Jenny kissed him. Whom? Well, him, the guy who wrote the poem. - That's the most important thing to you? - Not to me, to him. To all of us, in fact, because otherwise he wouldn't have written the poem. - Pantic, right? - Yes. Pantic. Your answer is actually correct. Partly. Maybe. Oh, how are we feeling this morning, Pantic? - I see you're feeling better. - Maybe you feel better, but I feel worse. Stuff and nonsense. Let's see. Look, 37.2. That's almost normal! - I see you're sitting up? - I am. - I bet you can stand up! - 'Course I can stand up. Let's try. Now walk a bit. Nice. There you are. - Erm, the crutches aren't mine. - Keep them, it doesn't matter. Nurse, change the sheets. And you just go and don't worry about a thing. - Go? Where? - Home, my friend. We've stabilised you. Nurse, give him a sedative, and another one just in case, and a discharge note. I've got to sign it. - Now go home, and then to work. - Can I? Don't you worry, just don't smoke or drink, don't eat salty, spicy, sour, or sweet, keep stress and worry to a minimum, leave your worries to others, but the rest is up to you. The rest? What rest? I can go to work, but he can't. Oh, this one's completely useless now. Gone completely loopy, it seems? - Poor fellow doesn't even know his own name. Had a stroke. - Well, what happened? It's incredible. He got all 13 hits betting on football games. ♪ Good morning... - Excuse me.

You should try it sometime, it makes a man stronger. Anyway, your son is improving. He even got a C once! I mean, that's not anything extravagant, but... Oh, please. Now I'm just thinking in terms of 'anything goes', I just don't want him to get all F's and fail the semester. Well, Comrade Pantic... - I wanted to ask you about something else, actually. - Ask away. - You've got a certain female person in your flat. - A dipshit, more like. - Excuse me? - I said, "A dipshit, more like". Well, you see... I intend to, uh... Take her. - Take her meaning...? - To be my wife. Now, I know it might seem a little strange to you. You know, sudden. But I saw her, I took her on a date... - Take her! - Pardon? Take her right now. But how can I marry a dipshit? Oh, that's just a pet name, I call her my little Dipshit, my mum calls her Cunt, and my son calls her Fuckwit. We all give her these pet names. She's a wonderful young lady. Enchanting. - Wait a minute... - There's no waiting, someone else is going to take her while you wait. - Comrade Pantic, I'd still like to think about it... - You don't need to think about it! Why should you? You see this flat? Nice-looking, functional, comfortable... But empty. Do you hear this horrible silence? - I need a friend. - Well, you can't find a better friend than her. - Even a fool can live in this flat. - Of course. But only a civilised, modest, and sensible person can live in those 9 square metres. Right. - Every inch of her is wisdom. - And she's so clean, too. She sits in the bathroom for two hours. She'd give her soul for the bathroom. - So you appreciate her too? - 'Course I do. Why wouldn't I? Because she's told me some pretty mean things about you. Mean? Quite mean. But if you praise her, Comrade Pantic, then she's clearly the one. And what did she say? She called you a 'savage'. Oh, sorry... Well, she says that there's always something you're missing, you're never content with the state of things. You're in a tight spot. Well, sadly, it's difficult to escape from a tight spot. Imagine: "A wild man in a tight spot." She expresses herself so beautifully. Quite beautifully, yes. Take her. Take her, and you'll be more than convinced. A wild man...

From now on, Sojic, we address each other with 'fucking pillock'. Come here, sweetie. Sit down and write. What is that mean, Pantic? It means that I've finally realised that you are the biggest scumbag in existence. Every single crook I report to you ends up thriving! - Thriving! - Write that down! Write it down, of course. You hired a thief, he's sitting back there smirking in my face, and she's doing stenography on her back!
