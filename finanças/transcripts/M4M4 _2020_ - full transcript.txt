You're welcome. Alya, it's your birthday. -Why are you unusually sullen? -Yes. Mom and I almost had an accident. Are you okay? Any cuts or bruises? No, I'm fine. What about your mom? Is she okay? She's fine. Both of you are okay. So everything is good, right? -Praise be to Allah. -Praise be to Allah. Hang on. Close your eyes. Turn around. You can't be trusted. -Do I have to? -No. Turn around. Should I count to three? One, two, three. Open. -Surprise! -Did you buy this? -Of course. It's for you. -Seriously? -It's so pretty. -I know, right? I have one too. -Hey! -Go away. He wants to steal a hug. Hang on. Are we still going out after school? We are. But I have to be home by four. My mom and I have a plan. In that case, how about we celebrate first? Sure. But I have to talk to my mom first. You know my mom, right? She could be planning a surprise for me. You're lucky. Your mom celebrates your birthday. Yes, you're so lucky. Look at me for example. I don't expect anything from my parents. They don't even remember my birth date. I only have her in my life. And she only has me. Here. What? This stuff is good. Unlike yours. No look, no taste. Where are you from? School? Are you picking up a cucumber? Ma'am, stop gossiping and start selling. Thank you. Ma'am, are you buying chicken? Let me tell you something. The poultry here is not fresh. Most of them were hit by vehicles. My friend at the next stall sells fresh chicken. I sell chicks too. Vietnamese, Thais, Burmese, and Filipinos. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Chicken. -Karma at its best. -Why are you so serious? You're chopping up dead chicken, not dead people. If I had to chop up dead people, your body would be first. I'm sleepy. I'm so bored. Come on. Will it be ready next year? I mean, I can't wait anymore. Don't you see I'm working? Why do you sound so committed? It's not your family business. You are paid. Even your boss doesn't want to be here. Aren't you taking a lunch break? Today, we'll have a buffet for lunch. You're ruining your friend's career. Let's go. Alya! Elly! Sir, we want to take a picture. Sure, give me a minute. I know you like cameras. But don't stare at them like that. What to do? I just love photography. I'm sorry, Alya. I wanted to buy you a camera. -But I don't have money. -Why would you do that for me? Because it's your birthday. Because it's my birthday? You don't have to. Because my mom might get me a camera this year. So buy me something else. -Like what? -Like a watch. Look, my hands look bare. A watch would make it nice. That's so crafty of you. Look at those cameras. -They are gorgeous. -Of course they are. That's why they are in a photo studio. I'm just saying. Because you two left me out. Hey, after we take a photo, let's have Thai soup noodles. -Sure. -Thai soup noodles? Sure, the usual. -The usual. -Let's take a photo first. -Let's go. -Where's the photographer? He's waiting inside. Danny, move it. It's those guys again. -Do you know them? -Don't you remember? They will come every time we're here. Forget about them. Alya. You can eat as much as you want today because he's paying for us. I'm not paying for you, only Alya. Alya, you can order anything you want. Hang on. My wallet. Can we drop by at school later? That's how you do it. Apai. Apai, she's your type, right? What? That one? How can we tell? She only shows her calf. Let's just watch from afar. A feast for the eyes. Shut your trap. What's my reward if I get her? Apai, don't be all bark and no bite. You sound like, "Woof! Woof!" The whole city hears you. Get her first, then we'll talk. I mean, she is nothing. Right? How many have you defiled? Even the married ones. A schoolgirl should be a piece of cake for you. Is that a challenge? You can say that. Come on, don't argue. She's right in front of you. She's your type. You like them untouched. What are you waiting for? Are you up for it or not? -You can do it, Apai. -Do you call yourself a man? Fine. That's our man. -Can I join you? -What's wrong with you? I'm not talking to you. Come. You can sit with us. No. -Come on. -I said no, didn't I? What makes you think I want to hang out with you? I don't even know you. You're such a snob. Come on. Hey! You insolent jerk! Keep your hand to yourself. -Hey! What's wrong with you? -What? Do you have a problem? You're one feisty girl. Hey! Hey! This is my stall! Get lost! Leave! Are you okay? Guys, sorry, I'm late. I was helping Mr. Wey. His stall is completely trashed. Now that Elly is here, I'll leave first. Hey. Where are you going? I have to go to school. I'm meeting a Form Six student. There's something we need to do. I'm late. I have to leave now. Alya, be safe. Alya. I forgot. How could you? I gave you that. Well, you should remind me. -I'm good at picking gifts. -Put it on for me, please. Spoiled brat. It's pretty. Where's the bus? What's taking it so long? Elly. -You leaked. -What? Really? Is it obvious? Listen. I'm going to the washroom. Wait for me here, okay? Which washroom? The school's washroom. -It's nearby. -Do you want to walk back to school? It's not far. Just wait here. Okay? What if the bus gets here? We'll just get a Grab. Okay? Wait for me here. Don't leave me, okay? Quickly, Elly! I know. Do I have to wait here alone? -Where are you going? -Home. -Go on and try. -What do you want now? Nothing. We just want to mess around with you. Don't go home. Let's grab a bite. We'll eat some eggs with chili sauce. Hey, where are you going? Don't be scared of us. Don't run. You'll get tired. -Don't even try. -No. Miss, where do you think you're going? You dropped your bag! -Mom! -Goodness! MY PRINCESS -Mom! -Miss. MY PRINCESS -Hey, your backpack! What a waste! -Mom! MY PRINCESS Hey! Stop! Hi, Aini. Help me out. She's going to escape. Hurry. This one, please. -It's medium-sized, right? -Yes. Found you. What do you want to write on the cake? "Mom loves Alya." "Mom loves Alya"? That's unique. Gosh. I left my wallet in the car. I'll be back. Aini, take a look first. Make sure it suits your preference. Sure. No matter where you run, we'll find you. I beg you. Please let me go. I'm sorry. I don't usually chase after girls. I only need to snap my fingers. But youâ€¦ You made us look like fools. Apai, I have a thing for rare items. I feel like I just need to have it. MOM LOVES ALYA What is it? I'm begging you. Please let me go. I want to go home. I'm tired. Mom. Mom, help me. I want to go home. Please let me go. Please. I want to go home. We scared her real bad. Let's just leave her here. Are you kidding? We can't just leave her here. She deserves better. Let me take you for a ride. Apai! Apai, that's enough! -Apai. -You're hurting me. You're hurting me! Mom! It hurts! Apai, that's enough! It hurts. Let me go. Help! Shut your mouth. -Wait for me. -Be quiet. Apai. Don't try to run. There's nobody here. I'm not asking for much. We'll just have some fun. Let me go. Let me go! You know you can't run. We're not kidding. Now, take off your skirt. Don't do this to me. Let me go! Once I lay my hands on something, I won't let go. The pain goes away when I'm satisfied. Did you spit on him? It smells good. Now, it's my turn to smack you around. -Come on. -What are you doing? We've gone far enough. Let's go! I forgot my battery died. I'm tired. Don't make me feel worse. Luk, what are we? We're a pack of wolves. Look. That goose is dying. Why are you making that face? Now, start howling and stop whining. If you want to stay in the pack, stop whining. Let her have it, Luk. Let's learn to live like a wolf. Mom. Mom, help me. Happy birthday to you I'm done. Your turn. Go on. No, I want to leave. Luk, you're a wolf. There's your feast. Go on, Luk. Apai. We feast together. If I go hungry, you do too. If I get to eat, you should too. Go ahead. -No. -Hey, not this way. That way. Go on. Where's Alya? She should be home by now. It's very late. Hello, Elly? Is Alya with you? No? No, she's still not home. It's late. Iâ€¦ Alya? Alya. My God, Alya! What happened to you? Sweetheart? Who did this to you? Answer me! Who did this to you? Alya, tell me! Sweetheart, tell me. Tell me who did this to you! Iâ€¦ was raped. My God! My God! Mom. Mom! Mom! Alya, sweetheart. Just one bite, sweetheart. Mom. Mom! Mom, help me! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! -Mom, help me! -Alya! -Mom! -Alya! My God. Alya, wake up. I'm right here, sweetheart. -I'm right here. My God! Sweetheart. -Mom. See? I'm right here with you. Sweetheart. Here. I bought you this. Here. Mom. -Aini, come here. -I have to go in now. It's her daughter. She was raped. Really? But her daughter is too young. Yes, that young girl. She's a Form Two student. -Did they report it to the police? -No, she's too ashamed. You can't be too careful these days. Mom. Mom. Wake up, Mom. Wake up. I know you haven't eaten. I made you fried rice. But I don't know how it tastes. Why don't you give it a try? In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Is it good? Mom. From this moment on, we have to stop wallowing in tears. We have to be strong. I'll be strong for you. And I'll be here for you. I'll always be here for you. I'm sorry, Mom. I love you, Mom. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm sorry. HI. WE MISS YOU. YOUR MOM IS HERE. YOU'D BETTER COME. Mom! Mom! -What are you doing? -Hurry up! You're hurting me! Let me go, you idiot! Idiot? She called me an idiot. Get up. Get up. You're hurting me! Did you call me an idiot? I'm not an idiot. I'm a doctor. You're the idiot. Now, let the doctor treat you. -That hurts! -Allow me-- Enough. She's not for you to keep. Apai is waiting. -Where's my mom? -Right, Apai. It hurts! -You're hurting me! -You want me to let you go? Let me go! I want you to delete that video. But why? We won't get anything then. I'm going to make it go viral. What more do you want? Do you see my arm? I'm going to make you pay until the pain goes away. Let me go home! When it goes viral, your friends at school will see it. Your neighbors will see it. The best part is your mom will see it too. She has a daughter who has lost her dignity. Why are we still talking? -Apai. -Let me go! Quiet! Allow me to inaugurate today's ceremony. I can't hold it any longer. -No! -She's so good. I was her first anyway. I'll finish this cigarette first. Take your time. Let go! Nowâ€¦ Do you want to play hard-to-get? Where do you think you're going? Remy! Alya? Alya. Alya. Alya. Alya? Alya. My battery died. Useless! Get her. Get her. But why? She runs so fast. Watch out. It's a dead end. Alya! Alya. -Alya. -Apai, what is she using? Hey, are you out of your mind? Where are you going? -Alya. -Where are you crawling to? Go on, jump too. Alya. -Hey, aren't we going to help her? -Jump and help her then. Go on, since you're so kind. Mom. Mom! Fall! Mom! Alya. Alya? Sweetheart? Alya. Why are you eating here, sweetheart? Let's eat at the table. My God. Alya. You scared me. Sweetheart. Sweetheart? Alya. What's the matter, sweetheart? Are you tired? Get some rest, okay? Lie down. Peace be upon you. Are you Mrs. Aini? Peace be upon you too. I'm Inspector Azahari from Bukit Aman Crime Unit. Is there anything I can do for you? Please come to the Forensic Unit to identify a body. Whose body? Your daughter. My daughter? She's inside, still asleep. I think you got the wrong address. Can I come inside just to make sure? Of course. Alya? But last night, sheâ€¦ I think you should come with us to identify her. My God. My God. -My God. -Please calm down, ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't. -You can't. -Please let me hold her. No, ma'am. -Just for a while. -You can't. Please let me hold her. You can't, ma'am. It's the procedure. You can't touch her. My goodness. Alya. Alya. I'm here, sweetheart. I'm here for you. I'll be here for you. Dear God! Allah the Greatest. Alya. Hurry, the food is ready. Hurry up, sweetheart. You're always late. Why are you smiling? Thank you, honey. Honey. When I'm gone, you must love Alya and care for her as you do now. Because you might remarry and forget you have a daughter. Fine. But what if I go first? Why would you say that? Aini. When I'm gone, you must take very good care of her. Teach her about religion. Give her all your care and attention. But most importantly, no matter what happens, you must be strong. Sir. Sir. -Hello? -Peace be upon you, Mrs. Aini. Sorry for calling despite your condition. I hope you're doing fine. Any development in my daughter's case? We're still investigating. We're waiting for the forensic report. I hope you'll understand and give us some time. Please call me if there's anything. I'll be sure to do that. Take care, ma'amâ€¦ Mom! Mom! It's Apai. -It's Apai. -Mom. Mom! My horsepower. Mom. Where's your mom? Mom, help me. It'sâ€¦ Remy here. Mom. I'm begging you. Please let me go. I want to go home. I'm tired. Who are you? Mom. When I'm gone, if you miss me, play this music box. Are you going to leave me? No, but I'm going to a boarding school. That hurts, Alya. Sir. Ali. Sir, we've got everything. They'll be sent to the Forensic Unit. Did you take the victim's photo? I've got everything, sir. I'll hand them over at the office. Sir, there are cuts on the victim's left arm. -Hello, Mrs. Aini? -Any news on my daughter's case? I think there is. I just need to verify it. -Where are you right now? -I'm at the post office. I'm sending a parcel. Later this afternoon, my officers and I need to see you. We have some questions regarding your daughter. I'll be at your office. That's all. Thank you. Apai. About what happened to Luk, don't say you know nothing. Not at all? I was with you yesterday. How should I know? I don't know what to say, man. But honestly, I've never felt so clueless like this. I don't know. Is this an illusion or what? But it's creeping me up. I have a bad feeling, man. What's wrong with you? Apai, it's Luk. Don't you think what happened hasâ€¦ Has something to do with us? Your life and mine are connected. If I feel this way, don't tell me you don't feel it. Can't you think of something? Come on, use your brain. Luk died at his workshop. I don't know which dealer got him. You know how big his mouth was. No one liked him. You are such a fool. That's easy for you to say. Why can't you use your brain for once? Use your brain! You idiot! Use yourâ€¦ You fool. You are making a mess here. Go away. The body we found this morning may be connected to Alya's death. What do you mean? We're still investigating. Based on our interview with the victim's friends, he had two good friends. Gosh. What are you looking for? What are you trying to find? Is it chicken? Chickenâ€¦ If you want to buy chicken, don't come this early. No one is here yet. Wellâ€¦ Bad things can happen to you. So you suspect they are involved in my daughter's death? We're still investigating, ma'am. If they're close, I bet they do bad things together. Am I right, sir? I know it's hard for you to answer all my questions. But I hope you will expedite the investigation before another victim meets my daughter's fate. I understand how you feel. But as you understand, we work based on procedures. -How many do you want? -One, please. Yes, I understand. You're not in my shoes. You don't feel the pain I feel. I want them to suffer and die as my daughter did. Where were you yesterday? Ma'am. Danny. Are you okay? You've been very quiet. I don't know. I feel awkward without Alya. Danny. On Alya's birthday, you suddenly left in a hurry. Why? Why do you want to know? I'm just asking. Well, stop asking. It won't change anything. Alya is gone. You liked her, didn't you? Everyone liked her. It's wrong. What you did was wrong, Aini. We can't take matters into our own hands. There's authority. Leave it to them to take action. Tell me, Wey. Will this give my daughter back? I know. I have no right. I have no right to even talk about it, let alone give you advice. Because it's you who's suffering, not me. You're the one suffering. To see is not equal to living it. But I don't want you to end up like me. You know, don't you? I was so selfish that I lost both of them. I lost both of them, Aini. You can't compare! Iâ€¦ I'm her mom. I raised her tenderly. I loved her dearly. She was my only pride and joy. She was my only company after my husband died. He told me to take care of her before he passed, but she was taken from me just like that. It would've been fine if she died like others do. But not like this. Life and death are not in our hands. It's in God's hands. What power do we have to stop death? When the time comes, it won't miss by even one second. You must understand that. Why me? Why me? Haven't I suffered enough with my husband's death? And now, my daughter is taken from me. What am I being tested for? I know we won't be tested beyond our capability. But Iâ€¦ I'm not strong enough to face all this. I don't know how to face this, Wey. I'm hurting so badly. Please tell me. What do I have to do now, Wey? Help me, please. Sir, give me half a chicken. Cut it into small pieces. -How much? -Ten ringgit. CHICKEN PRICE LIST Thank you. Remy. What kind of stuff is this? It tastes burned like charcoal. It was so easy back then, unlike now. What are you doing? Incubating? Where are your eggs? That stuff is making me go nuts. I almost forgot. What is this? Do you want to play? Let's play. Where are you? No more sound? Why would you do this to me? Help me. I came to help indeed. Have mercy. I'm in pain. Are you? Are you in pain? When Alya was crying, did you show her mercy? Alyaâ€¦ You're too filthy to say her name. I think these cases are connected. Is Mrs. Aini your suspect? But that's impossible, sir. She looks like a nice woman. Besides, she's a single mother. But she's a mother after all. Sir. We have a new case. Remy. What happened? Tell me who did this. Mom. I didn't get to apologize to her. I didn't get to tell her that I loved her so much. She loved you. Because you were the only friend she had other than Danny. Do you want to know something? I was always jealous of her. She was smart, pretty, and lively. She was always at peace. On top of that, she had a mom who loved her very much. Her life seemed perfect, unlike mine. I doubt I would find a friend like her again. I miss her so much, Mrs. Aini. Yes. We all miss her. I knew it. I knew you would find me. So you knew I would come for you? But I'm not stupid like them. Of course you're not. But your heart is as revolting as your face. Damn! No wonder your daughter was so delightful. But I think you're even better. I can't have your daughter again. But I guess I can still have you. I know Mrs. Aini has something to do with these two cases. So, do you want to bring her in? I'm sorry, Alya. I had no money to buy you a camera. Elly, you leaked. Really? Is it obvious? Alya? Alya. Fall! She fell for real. Damn it. My God. She's dead. Hey, what have you done? What did you do? Is she really dead? Answer my question! Is she really dead? I'll answer you with my hand. I don't think she's dead. Hey, get up. Apai, what are we going to do? Apai, answer me! Get rid of her. Hey, what are you doing? Apai! Are you sure about this, Apai? Mom. Alya? Where were you? I've been looking for you. I miss you so much. I didn't go anywhere. I'm always near you. I can't do it, sweetheart. Don't worry, Mom. I'm here with Dad. You can join us later. But now, you have to be strong. Alya? Alya! Sweetheart? Sweetheart? There are still loose ends. Mrs. Aini. No one is home. Sergeant, let's get inside. Move! Mom! Mom! Peace be upon you. Danny, what are you doing here? I came to see Mrs. Aini. I'm going to that old building. Everything began there. -Take all our units there. -Yes, sir. -Ali. -Corporal. Apai. Apai, that's enough. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to be your call girl anymore. Let me go. It wouldn't have been this way if Alya hadn't died. -Let me go. -What are you talking about? Remy and Luk died because of you. You're the reason for all of this. I know I made a mistake. I know, but I can't do this anymore. I don't want to be your call girl anymore. When will you have enough? When? Until I say it's enough, you will stay right here. The two who died and left me -are the people I loved. -You animal! What do you know about love? You bastard! Let me go! How could you do this to me? Did you think I would let you get away easily? It's either you or me that will come out alive tonight. Are you crazy? Crazy? When you raped my daughter, did you think of the consequences? If I don't kill all of you, I won't be able to die peacefully. Even years of imprisonment won't be able to make up for the pain I feel. You didn't just kill my daughter. You murdered my soul too. She was my heart and soul. Forgive me. What did you just say? I didn't hear you. Can you say that one more time? Mom. What? Louder! I can't hear you! Say that again! -Again! -Mom. For 16 years, she called me by that name. "Mom." "Mom." Do you want to know something? I miss my baby so much. She's not here anymore for me to spoil. Do you get it? Imagine how I feel. Do you get it? Forgive me. Please save me. I'm sorry. Please help me! Please! Please help me! Help! Please help me! Shut up! Shut up! You animal! You animal. Animal! We're both animals! Sleep, my precious Sleep, my love Mom's little baby Let me push your swing Swing Swing up high Aini! Heâ€¦ He killed my baby. I have the recording, Aini. I promise you. He will pay for what he did. What can he pay with after what he did to my daughter? Who can give me back my daughter? Who? Who? For what they did in this world, they will get worldly punishment. But they still can't get away from God's punishment. Worldly punishment? No punishment in this world can ever bring back my daughter. No. Our spouses and children are lent to us by God for this temporary life. They are temporary blissfulness. They don't belong to us. They belong solely to God. Solely to God.
