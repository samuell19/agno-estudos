I, Louis-Napoleon, emperor of France pledge our wealth and the might of our army not in a spirit of selfish conquest but in a crusade to restore to our race and the rest of the civilized world our ancient force and prestige. Let the world know that our conquest of Mexico is only the beginning of the fulfillment of our holy mission. What does this letter mean to us, Louis? What does it mean? The American Civil War may end at any moment.. and the North is going to win. - What do you think it means? - But we... We undertook the Mexican conquest on the theory the South would be victorious that a divided America would be unable to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. You! You are responsible for this, Randon. You convinced us that the South was certain to triumph. And this Battle of Gettysburg is incomprehensible. It is your business as minister of war to know which side will win a battle before it is fought! Your Imperial Majesty I-I admit my mistake, but I... Mistake? Mistake, you call it? I cannot afford the luxury of such things as mistakes! Mistakes are for constitutional monarchs presidents and suchlike not for a supreme autocrat. Millions have been poured into the Mexican conquest millions for men, more men, ships, munitions. I could have conquered half of Europe at less cost. You and your banker friends have got me into this mess. Well, Your Majesty is unfair. The collection of Mexico's debt was of secondary importance. Your Majesty intervened in Mexico to block the spread of American democracy. Democracy, the rule of the cattle by the cattle, for the cattle. Abraham Lincoln. Parliaments, plebiscites, proletarians a mob intoxicated with ideas of equality. Cattle! Am I to be destroyed by such filth? Am I? Well, what do you advise now? Shall we evacuate Mexico admit the defeat of French imperialism at the hands of Benito Juarez, an Indian bandit and be engulfed by a revolution here at home.. or should we wait for the Yankees to destroy us on the Rio Grande? Well, if we evacuate Mexico now we're certain to have trouble here at home. As I see it, there's everything to lose by an immediate withdrawal. No doubt, that's the way you do see it, de Morny! Calm yourself, Louis. We have no great problem in this affair. Does madame imply that she sees a solution? Take a lesson from your uncle, Louis. How did the first Napoleon hold Holland? By giving Holland a monarch. How did he hold Sweden? By giving Sweden a monarch. Why shouldn't you hold Mexico in the same way by giving Mexico a monarch of its own? But, Genie, you forget the Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine applies only to the taking of American territory by European powers.. not to the internal affairs of the American nation. Consequently, the United States would have no legal grounds for complaint were Mexico to have an emperor.. who happened to favor French interests. Well, no doubt the gentlemen of the Mexican Conservative Party whom Senor Montares represents will be overjoyed at the prospect of a monarch. A monarch who would return to us the lands which were seized by Benito Juarez? A splendid idea. Excellent! And since the idea originated with madame it should be her privilege to nominate the future emperor of Mexico herself. Then let us see. There's Prince Albrecht of Anhalt-Zerbst. Oh, but he's a Protestant, of course, and won't do. The Margrave Karl of Lippe-Detmold. Too old. The Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Oh, but he's a Habsburg, of course, and couldn't accept. Not even if the Mexican people were to offer him the throne through a plebiscite? Let us try. - What's your name? - Jose de la Cruz. - Can you write? - No. Put your mark here. - What's your name? - Juan Maleno. Can you write? Do not write your names, companeros. You are being tricked! We don't want an emperor. We still have a president, Benito Juarez who helped us get lands. If an emperor comes, he will take them away! Then we shall starve and be slaves again! Put your mark here. - What's your name? - Antonio Rosales. - Write it here. - I will not sign! Viva Juarez! I will not sign! It's a trickery! We don't want an emperor! Viva Benito Juarez! Viva la republi.. "The constitutional president of the Republic "to the people of Mexico. "Mexicans.. "the guilt of Napoleon III "whose lust for conquest "has destroyed thousands of Mexicans "the guilt of those traitors here at home "who would sell their birthright to foreigners "for the privilege of exploiting their fellow countrymen '"the guilt of all who have conspired' '"to commit the gravest crime against civilization' "which is the despoiling of the liberty of a free people "now embodies itself in the person of the usurper "Maximiliano von Habsburg. "Let him who would come to our shores "to rule over us as a tyrant "know that the cause of democracy "has not perished and shall not perish. "Let him know, that to us "the defense of democracy is an imperative duty "since it is the defense of our own honor "the dignity of our wives and children "the honor and dignity of all men. "Let him know that the struggle of right against might "shall never cease in Mexico "until the last patriot lies "with the thousands upon thousands "who have already laid down their lives "for truth, liberty "and justice. 'Done at Saltillo, this first day of May, 1864."' 'Marechal Bazaine, I can assure you' 'of His Majesty's complete confidence.' During my stay in Paris he repeatedly expressed his pleasure in having you in command of his troops here in Mexico. I'm very grateful for His Majesty's confidence. Well, what is it? Grand total of the plebiscites. In favor of the monarchy, 6,020,758. Against the monarchy, 60,412 being a majority of 5,960,346. In other words, 99% of the entire vote an overwhelming majority for your friend, the archduke, senor. Thanks to your cooperation Monsieur le Marechal. All we need do now is to await the arrival of His Imperial Majesty Maximilian von Habsburg by the grace of God and the will of the people emperor of Mexico. On this historic occasion as Your Majesties first set foot upon this soil the eager heart of Mexico is too full of pride and gratitude to speak more than a single word welcome. It is with a feeling of profound reverence that we set foot upon this soil, senor in the full consciousness of our obligation to it and to those who have entrusted their destinies to our hands. With your Imperial Majesty's permission the liberator of Mexico le Marechal Achille Bazaine. Your Imperial Majesties it is my privilege and pleasure to convey the congratulations of the French Army of Occupation. We are grateful to the Army of Occupation and to you personally, Monsieur le Marechal. Max! It's alive. It's one of Your Majesty's most valuable servants. The vultures of Mexico are protected by law. They are the scavengers of its cities consuming all garbage and keeping its streets clean. 'Colonel Miguel Lopez' 'commanding the escort in charge' of Your Majesty's personal safety. You have a large command, colonel. Is there a possibility we may be attacked? Not the slightest, sire. We only wish to secure Your Majesties against any intrusions. We shall feel very safe in your charge, Colonel Lopez. Your Majesties will travel over the exact route that Hernan Cortes followed in his conquest of Mexico. Strange, Max. Many flags, many soldiers but not a Mexican in sight. General Lopez, the streets seem to be empty except for the soldiers. Uh, why are there no townspeople here to greet us? It's because of the plague, Your Majesty. - What plague? - Black plague, Your Majesty. There's an epidemic in the city and all public gatherings have been forbidden. What is it? Nothing. Since we set foot off the ship.. I have felt myself surrounded by mystery.. as though everything we looked at possessed some... hidden meaning. It has touched me, too, Max. It's made me apprehensive at having urged you so much toward this undertaking. But you must never let my opinions influence your own best judgment, dearest. But I rely upon your influence, liebchen. You have a comprehension that lets you see into the heart of things. You were right in setting me on the road to my manifest destiny. Max, it's getting colder very quickly. Let us have a rug. 'What's that?' "If Your Serene Highness is an honorable man "I tell you that you are the victim "of a fraud '"which was designed to make you believe' "that the people of Mexico desired a monarch. "And I tell you to leave Mexico "and never to return "in the role of an emperor. "But if Your Serene Highness is without honor "and yourself a party to this fraud "I commend you to your own conscience "and to the tremendous judgment of history. 'Benito Juarez."' It was just after we left the pueblo of San Vicente and were going up into the mountains they found your letter, Senor Presidente. Maximiliano and Carlota sat in troubled silence for a long time after they read it. 'Is his uniform very splendid?' Yes, senor. He is a magnifico. Tall and fair with blue eyes and a beard yellow like the silk of the corn. The Indians thought, many of them that he was the Fair God, Quetzalcoatl come back again. The blond god of the Aztec Indians who promised to return someday when he sailed away into the sunrise. They will not think him a god when he takes back their lands. You should have seen their entrance into Mexico City. It was quite different from the reception they got on their arrival. They were acclaimed, senores even by many who hate the French. 'We know.' The blood must be let out of all that magnificence. The servants in the palace say that four times every day Maximiliano changes his clothes down to his skin once in the morning when he rides his horse once when he sits with his ministers once when he walks with Carlota by the pool in the park and once again before he eats dinner. They walk by the pool in the park, did you say? Are they guarded when they walk there? - No, senor. - Very good, Manuel. Go now and find out whatever else you can. - Adios, senores. - Adios. There are thickets by that pool deep thickets where a man can wait with a knife. Eh, senores? No, Carbajal. We're not assassins.. nor are we, as Napoleon would have the world believe a pack of savage bandits. A responsible government does not stab a man in the back. His crime must be judged according to the laws of the land. It is the Mexican people who will punish the man who calls himself their emperor. You are quite right, Senor Presidente. Our cause has suffered enough heaven knows, from the impression in Europe that none of us are persons of culture and refinement. I'm less concerned about what Europe thinks of our social graces, Senor Orale than I am about the Indians believing Maximiliano to be a God. Mexico was first conquered because its people believed a European to be a god. And that is the inevitable course of tyranny from Caesar to Napoleon. Tyrants always make their appearance in that guise, Palacio.. because to exist, they must, like gods be the objects of the people's blind faith. A faith which enslaves.. rather than uplifts. And when a people is sufficiently weakened only then does the despot dare unmask himself. But it is too late.. for then the people are slaves. It is our task to strip the cloak of godliness from him and show him to the Mexican people for what he really is. That may not be so easy, Don Benito. We must not lose courage. Buenas noches, senores. Buenas noches, Senor Presidente. 'General Regules, Palacio.' 'Would you be good enough to follow me' 'to my quarters, please?' Thank you, Senor Tejada. Don Benito. What I must say to you, I can express only with deepest pain and embarrassment but as you yourself would be the first to admit the cause of liberty must come before everything else.. even personal affection. Well.. Those of us close to you are well aware of your wisdom your humanity, your capacity for government but in the eyes of the world in the eyes of many Mexicans, you are an Indian. Well.. Now, the influence of this Habsburg are the forces combating it best represented by a figure of one like yourself an Indian? Does it not make our cause appear a racial struggle instead of a struggle of the whole people? Well.. Don Benito, I'd sooner have my tongue cut out than say it but I believe you should make room for another. Yes, I would resign in favor of someone of European blood. You, as vice presidente of the Republic would naturally be my successor. Whoever takes over the office would do so in name only, Don Benito. You would continue to be the real power. Your voice would command, your will would be obeyed. Pure Spanish, are you not, Senor Uradi? Oh, yeah. There's not a drop of any other blood in my veins. There is much merit in what you say. Your concern is not unfounded. It was, perhaps, gross neglect on my part not to remind the oppressed and the starving who elected me that because of my Indian blood I was unfit to reclaim for them their human heritage. And they.. in their anxiety to be freed from oppression and misery overlooked that most important fact. It is true, I'm a poor ugly figure of an Indian, indeed.. to be opposing one like Maximiliano.. one so magnificent that he's taken for a god.. by my despised and downtrodden brothers. But is not the struggle of any downtrodden element the struggle of the whole people? And certainly you Senor Vice presidente would not suggest that I should abandon them now only because I'm one of them. Buenas noches, Senor Uradi. Buenas noches. It's understood, then that the ermine border of the mantle must be increased by eight inches with miniver tails at intervals of six instead of twelve inches. That's to distinguish me from an archduke, colonel. Yes, Your Majesty, you will forgive our ignorance of such refinements here in Mexico. 'Oh, I quite understand.' Your Majesty, it's time for your quinine. You're a tyrant, the way you rule me, Dr. Basch. And do you happen to know where Her Majesty is? The empress is not in the palace at the present moment, Your Majesty. Uh, where has she gone? Upon the vainest of pilgrimages, Your Majesty. ♪ Ah ah ♪ ♪ Ave Maria ♪ ♪ Ah ah ah ♪ ♪ Ave Maria♪♪ Holy Mary. Mother of God. Harken unto me.. the least, the most humble of thy suppliants. Deny me not, I beseech thee.. the pain and the agony which were thine. Deny me not, most blessed of women.. the joy and the ecstasy which thou knew. Endow me with a portion of thy sanctity.. that I may bear unto my spouse.. a son. And here.. I vow unto thee, oh, queen of heaven.. a grateful, humble heart.. a chapel domed in lapis lazuli.. an altar of alabaster.. and thine own image in finest gold.. to the glory of thy holy name. Amen. Samuel, old friend. Sometimes I wonder if we have been wise in not telling her that she can never have a child. Hope, Your Majesty, even the vainest of hopes is a great consolation to a woman's heart. Crush that hope and who can tell what the consequences might be? No, sire, I do not regret that we have concealed the truth from her. Your Majesty, Monsieur le Marechal Bazaine and Senor de Montares request an informal audience. We shall receive them in our study. Ah, Senor. Monsieur le Marechal. Le Marechaland I wish to consult you with regard to the seating of the foreign diplomats at the coronation ceremony. Oh, well, there should be no great problem about that, Senor Montares. Now, let me see your list. 'Here it is, Your Majesty.' Diplomats always take precedence according to their length of service at a court. And I.. I find no provision here for the representative of the United States. There is no representative of the United States at Your Majesty's court. Do you mean they still look upon Benito Juarez as the head of a legal Mexican government? Whether they actually have an envoy accredited to Juarez, I cannot say. Marechal Bazaine, how many men are with Juarez? About twenty five thousand men in his Northern armies. Twenty five thousand men? Yes, sire, and in the south, about twelve thousand. Marechal! I had no idea. No idea. My understanding was that the country had been completely pacified.. that no such things as organized Republican government or, or organized republican resistance continued to exist. The situation is not as serious as it must seem to Your Majesty. Of course not, Your Majesty. The Republican Army is an undisciplined rabble poorly armed, without leadership, without.. I am no militarist, Marechal. I didn't come here to conquer but to rule peacefully. To that end, let us enter into negotiations with Benito Juarez immediately. Negotiations? Your Imperial Majesty might as well try to come to terms with some wild beast in the jungle. The whip, the bullet and the bayonet is the only language his kind understand. Your Majesty need trouble his mind no longer about Benito Juarez. Within 30 days, the Indian will be dead captured or driven out of the country. I guarantee it. The Emperor Napoleon has reinforced me to 50,000 men with complete munitions for a final offensive which I am now ready to launch on all fronts. We're all ready, Don Benito. Camilo, the picture. The gringo? Yes, Camilo. The gringo. Eat. We're hopelessly trapped unless we can get to the pass at Encantada before Bazaine arrives. What difference does it make if we get through the pass or not? The hour has come when we must face the truth or perish. What do you mean? We should ask Bazaine for an armistice come to terms with the emperor. - Armistice. - That's for Benitoto decide. Don Benito. Does he expect us to resist two French corps with a handful of broken-down battalions? I saw it coming long ago. We are hopelessly defeated! Are more and more lives to be sacrificed for a dead cause or shall we act now with wisdom instead of brute courage? Buenas noches, senores. - Senor Juarez! - 'Buenas noches.' Don Benito, we must abandon Saltillo immediately. We hope to get through the pass at Encantada. When we get through the pass, what then? Then.. we shall begin all over again.. but what we will fight no more pitched battles with the French. We shall stop fighting Bazaine his way and make him fight our way. The army will be disbanded. Officers and men will scatter and return to their own states. Lie low, but keep in touch with one another until they receive orders from me. Where the government will be, I do not know. A week here, a day there. The capital will be on wheels.. my carriage. Doubtless, it will be forced further and further back even to the border of the United States.. but it will never cross the border. For as long as a constitutional government remains on Mexican soil the Republic of Mexico continues to exist. French artillery! French artillery. - We are trapped. - No, we are not. - 'What are you going to do?' - Attack the French. Delay them until our army can get through the pass. It's sheer madness to risk any lives in such a hopeless attack! Adios, Senor Juarez. Adios, Porfirio. Companeros! To victory or death! 'It was here, Your Imperial Majesty' that we took General Porfirio Diaz a prisoner. And Benito Juarez? Is either a fugitive in the deserts of Chihuahua or has crossed the border into the United States. In other words, all organized republican resistance has ceased to exist. Your Majesty, I guarantee it. We are unqualifiedly grateful to you, Monsieur le Marechal and to the soldiers of France. My humble thanks, Imperial Majesty. We are also grateful to our loyal Mexican brigades who participated in the campaign. It is our wish that General Miguel Miramon shall become minister of war. Thank you, Your Majesty. General Tomas Mejia, you will take rank as commander in chief of the Imperial Mexican Army. It's too great an honor, Imperial Majesty. I cannot accept. Being Indian, I am unworthy. What has your race to do with your fitness to command General Mejia? Everything, Your Majesty. But I-I don't understand. Being of noble Aztec stock, no doubt your heritage of blood is the most ancient in this room. It is our will that you assume the post to which you have been raised and it is our trust that you will do it great honor. And now, senores, to civil matters. Your Imperial Majesty.. may I present for your signature the most pressing of all enactments? "An act restoring to the legal owners certain lands." Uh, what does this refer to, Senor Montares? Those properties which were confiscated from the legal owners by Benito Juarez. Into whose hands did these lands pass? The hands of a million or more peons, Your Imperial Majesty. Uh, did Juarez divide the land amongst them? That is what it amounted to. Actually, the lands were put up at auction. And, uh, who received the money paid in at these auctions? The owners, sire. But what ridiculous sums! Nothing like the true worth of the lands. How much land was involved in these transactions, senores? Eighty percent of the best land of all Mexico. And how many individual owners are concerned? Eighty five, Imperial Majesty eighty five estates. We cannot likely set our hand to an instrument which might well be against the best interests of a great majority of our subjects. Your Majesty! The sanctity of vested rights. But what of the peons who would be without if the land were taken away from them? What if they are without land? They were without lands for 300 years before Benito Juarez. Uh, senores.. when the vested rights of 85 individuals conflict with the welfare of a nation then the welfare of the nation must prevail. But those are the very words of Benito Juarez! Indeed? Your Imperial Majesty the abrogation of these sales is a fundamental demand of the Conservative Party the party that put you on the throne. We are responsible to no political party, Senor Montares. Your Imperial Majesty, it would cause us the deepest regret to resign from the council so early in Your Majesty's reign. Your resignations are accepted, senores. We will permit no one to infringe upon our prerogative to protect the best interests of a great majority of our subjects. "A great majority of our subjects." In returning my portfolio to your Imperial Majesty.. may I express the hope that he may be able to rely upon that same majority of his subjects in his hour of need? You have our leave to go, senores. You have our leave to go. We are Your Majesty's servants. I am very grateful to you, gentlemen. El presidente! - President. - Senor. Has SenorTejada not arrived from El Paso? He should have important news from Washington.. now that the civil war has ended. No, he has not arrived, but here is the latest news from Washington, Senor Presidente. General Escobedo. All flags of the Republic would be flown at half-mast. All officers and members of the government.. will wear black armbands.. to mourn the loss of a friend. With him died our last hope of aid from his government. Don Benito. Who is this boy? And what does he want? I am Pepe. He's Pepe. - Pepe? - Yes. My son. He has a message for you. From Senor Perez. He says everyone in Oaxaca will be ready to fight again as soon as you send them the guns and bullets. You are a brave boy, Pepe. - And a good shepherd, too. - So? I was a shepherd, too. Tell me, Pepe. Was it a good spring for the grass of Oaxaca this year? No. It was very bad, Don Benito. I had to take my sheep to the high country and a timber wolf killed three lambs. Hm. What did you do? I set my dogs on him.. but at first, they didn't know the right way to fight him. Then they learned the right way. And what was the right way, Pepe? They found out he would turn to chase whichever of them bit him. So they made a big ring around him. When he chased Malo Pinta came down and bit his hind legs! And when he turned after Pinta Chico came up and bit his flank! And when he turned after Chico Fea came up and bit his other flank! And when he turned after Fea Malo rushed in and it began all over again! Then when he was too tired and too torn to run anymore they all closed in and killed him! Yes, Pepe. That is the right way to fight the wolf. 'A peaceful enough country town on the surface, Your Majesty.' 'The plaza no quieter, no noisier than usual.' Everything just the same as any other weekday. Suddenly, an inferno breaks loose. The garrisons of Salinas, of Zamora, of Santiago of 50 other places is wiped out. The supports, when they arrive, find nothing but a deserted town and nobody for miles around who knows anything about what happened. Well, these outbreaks, are they local revolutions or is Benito Juarez behind them? Undoubtedly, Juarez is behind them, Your Majesty. Look at the map. They commence in Michoacan. I send reserves there from the south. The outbreaks cease and commence in the east. I send men to the east the outbreaks cease and begin in the west. The locations of the outbreaks and the order in which they occur show beyond question they're all part of a devilish plan. So Juarez is not finished. 'What measures have you in mind, Marechal?' Repressive ones, Your Majesty. We are no longer opposed by legitimate forces but by an enemy masquerading as peaceful citizens by treachery. It must be put down mercilessly. Now, do you want my signature to this decree? Yes, Imperial Majesty. Monsieur le Marechal the death penalty is not for those who act however misguidedly, from principle. Your Majesty must face reality put down his weaker feelings and act with strength and resolution. We must destroy the enemy before he can destroy us. But the instinct which prompts patriotism is one of the noblest in human nature. Those who believe they are fighting for their country are not to be used as criminals. 'But, Your Majesty... ' Would you consider a man like the prisoner General Diaz, for example to be a criminal? Why, my physician, Dr. Basch, who attended his wound says that the sincerity of Diaz is no more to be questioned than his military reputation. The empire will have a place for him and for others like him when they can be convinced of my equal sincerity. It will not be upon the gallows, Monsieur le Marechal. No. I shall never sign such a decree. Never. Your Majesty, I shall speak bluntly. We have no time to waste in putting down all resistance to your reign here. The American Civil War has ended. And unless Your Majesty's government is established without opposition the United States may find that your presence in Mexico is in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. What has the Monroe Doctrine to do with my presence here? It applies only to the extension of European systems to the Americas. I am responsible to no power outside of Mexico. The United States might hold otherwise. Well, how can they? In the light of so democratic a means is the plebiscite upon which I accepted the throne. What significance has a plebiscite in a country like this where 80% of the people cannot read, write nor understand? Do you mean that the plebiscite was not a true expression of the vast majority of the Mexican people? Most of the vast majority which voted in Your Majesty's favor were ignorant peons who did not know whom or what they were voting for. Am I to understand.. ..that coercion was used? We bid you good day, Monsieur le Marechal. Oh, Carlota. What is it, Maxl? I have just learned something which places me as emperor of Mexico.. in a terrible light. Yes? The name of Habsburg has been used to conceal an iniquitous enterprise. Napoleon has made us his dupes. Then Juarez's letter is true? Yes, Carlota. I was brought to the throne of Mexico by a pretended plebiscite.. a fraud! And now I am expected to maintain myself upon it by the slaughter of subjects who neither acknowledge nor desire me. Maxl, dear.. There must be something we can do. I have no choice. There is but one course in keeping with my honor. I must abdicate. Abdicate? A Habsburg is not a usurper. Maxl. Sovereignty is the most sacred obligation of man. By abdicating you might cause the world to think that when you accepted the crown you knew full well the plebiscite was false.. and that after plotting with Napoleon you became fearful of failure and proclaimed your innocence at his expense. Am I to impose myself upon a people for that reason? Maxl. What was the oath you swore when they placed the crown of Mexico on your head? "To protect and defend her people.. even to the shedding of my life's blood." Well, do so, then. Show the world that no earthly consideration can keep you from fulfilling that oath. Think, Maxl, think.. not of abandoning your country in her time of necessity but of a way to deliver her from the hands of her enemies! There may be a way. I think there is a way. General Porfirio Diaz. 'I am Maximilian von Habsburg.' I want to talk to you. What have we got to talk about? Much, I think. I deeply regret that this meeting had to take place in a prison cell. Where else could it take place but in a prison cell or on the battlefield? Then from all accounts, senor it is as well for me that we meet here. If my generals are to be believed you are the best soldier in Mexico. I do not fight for glory, but for liberty. That is why I need your help. My help? At what price, Maximiliano? A command in your army, a medal or merely money? If any material consideration could buy you, General Diaz I should not be here. How can I help you? In bringing peace to Mexico. Only one man can bring peace to Mexico Benito Juarez. What is he, Benito Juarez that he inspires such men as yourself, General Diaz? Tell me. What is he? He is an ugly little man in a black frock coat. He is Benito Juarez. He was born in misery 'to live on a few grains of corn a day.' He labored for an education. He used it to help his own people and they elected him as their representative. He was imprisoned and exiled by a dictator but he helped to destroy the dictator and free Mexico. He wrote the constitution. He became president of Mexico. He ruled it justly and well till traitors and landowners and speculators brought the French to depose him and put you in his place! You! Maximiliano Von Habsburg. What is it that he wants? To put an end to the things that he himself has endured to educate, to liberate to uplift through democracy. Then all that lies between us is a word, General Diaz for otherwise, Benito Juarez and I are in accord. A word, senor? Only a word. Democracy. I agree with Benito Juarez that in theory it is the ideal system.. but in practice government by the people can become the rule of a mob a mob which follows whatever demagogue will promise most. From such as these, General Diaz only a monarch can protect the state. Why a monarch more than a president? Because a president is a politician and must answer to his party but a king is above factions and parties. A president may be poor and therefore open to temptation but a king, having everything desires nothing. Do you mean to say there can be no such thing as a corrupt king? What about your friend, Napoleon? Uh, Napoleon is not a true monarch, senor any more than he is an aristocrat. Kings are born to their thrones. Napoleon took the crown of France by force. 'Napoleon is a dictator.' 'And dictators do not govern with justice' but with contempt. It is different with a king who is a king. A greater obligation rests upon him than upon those of lesser birth the obligation to defend his own honor which is the honor of his ancestors and the honor of his posterity, as well. You may be honest, excelencia. I believe you are.. but I am no politico to understand such matters. Who knows what tyrant will follow you sent by Napoleon? You have no son. You have our word as a Habsburg that the succession will be regulated immediately.. without foreign influence and in the best interest of the nation. General Diaz will you carry a message for me to Benito Juarez? A message? What message? Tell him.. I want him to be Prime Minister of Mexico. He should reach Juarez within three weeks' time. If he accepts, all Mexico will be in your hands. Napoleon, Bazaine, the Conservatives they all must bow to you. Oh, Maxl, what a sublime stroke of statecraft. It's destiny that I should join forces with Juarez. We're opposites, yes but united opposites like magnetic poles. We shall augment each other. Yes, Carla, it's destiny. It's greatness, my dear but not beyond my faith in your capacity to be great. You will be the enlightened ruler of a new era in monarchy. Listen. Listen, Maxl. Beautiful. "La Paloma." The song of the dove. It's the loveliest melody I know. I wonder who's singing. Who knows? The wife of some gardener. The sweetheart of some soldier. Mexico. If to your window should come a dove.. treat it tenderly, for it is I. Tell it of your love, my life's enchantment. Crown it with flowers, for it is I. It must be terrible to be separated from one's love. I don't think I could live apart from you, Maxl. It all began in Brussels.. where a little girl with big, staring eyes used to follow you around her father's palace like a beagle. Oh, Maxl. It's like a fairy tale, isn't it? Here stood the very Halls of Montezuma.. the feathered emperor himself. And down there in the park below are living trees which actually saw him. Oh, I wonder what they think about us you and me. Maxl. At this moment, I could be the happiest woman in the world... if.. - Carlota. - Yes? Uh.. I am going to ask you to join me in a great sacrifice. - A sacrifice? - Yes. It is necessary that the nation should be given some assurance as to the succession.. e-even if it means that the crown will not pass to our own... possible descendants. Not pass to our own? You may recall having read of the ill-fated Emperor Iturbide who attempted to establish a monarchy in Mexico some 40 years ago. Well, it appears there is a grandson of his a mere child whom I think it might be well to consider.. since he has some color of title to the throne. Is it so urgent, then? I think it might help to bring peace to Mexico if we were to take this child of good Mexican blood under our protection and train him for the future. Do you mean.. adopt? There would inevitably have to be some, uh legal formality. Maxl.. with whom have you been consulting? Not with Basch! Not with Basch! Carlota. Carla. Perhaps in God's infinite wisdom it's all for the best. Perhaps it is better that Mexico should have a successor of Mexican blood. Send me away! Marry someone who can give you a child. A Habsburg son of your own. I love you enough to go.. to be glad to go for your sake. I love you enough for anything. There will be no child of my blood that is not yours, Carla. Oh, Maxl! Let me arrange it, then. Let me bring him to you. The little boy-child, Iturbide.. as if he were our own. 'Sign here, sign here.' General Diaz! Don Porfirio! General Diaz. Senor Juarez. Porfirio. It has been a long ride to reach you here on the border. So you escaped, Porfirio? No, Senor Juarez. I was given my freedom. Maximiliano ordered it. Maximiliano himself. You saw him? He came to the prison, to my cell.. alone. He talked. At first, I suspected trickery, but afterward... What did he talk about? About his ideas of government. I doubted my own ears for what I heard, was you speaking your words out of his mouth. Like you, Senor Juarez, he wants to help our people. How? By protecting them from those who would oppress them. Virtue is a formidable weapon in the hands of an enemy. But he's not your enemy. Your aims are his aims. He says only a word democracy lies between him and you. Only a word? He is honest, Senor Juarez. You will know how honest when I tell you his message. So... there is a message? He wants you to be Prime Minister of Mexico.. in a monarchy founded upon the principles of your own constitution. But.. it's the constitution of a republic, Porfirio. Well, he swear she will defend its principles against the politicos and selfish interests. He says that such principles must always be defended by someone like himself someone who is above all factions and parties. Maximiliano says only a word stands between him and me only the word democracy. Porfirio. What does it mean, this, this word? Democracy? Why, it means liberty liberty for a man to say what he thinks to worship as he believes. It means equal opportunity. No. No, that cannot be its meaning, Porfirio. Maximiliano offers us all these things without democracy. What is it, then, that he would withhold from us? O-only the right to rule ourselves. Then that must be the meaning of the word, Porfirio.. the right to rule ourselves.. the right of every man to rule himself and the nation in which he lives. And since no man rules himself into bondage therefore liberty flows from it as water from the hills. I understand, Senor Juarez. I say, to entrust one's fate to a superior individual is to betray the very spirit of liberty the spirit by which each man may raise himself to that level of human dignity where no man is the superior of any other.. where even the lowliest is uplifted to the worth of his manhood.. and is able to rule with wisdom justice and tolerance toward all men. Should I not know it, Porfirio? Am I not of the lowliest? I was a fool, Senor Juarez. Only a word democracy may stand between Maximiliano von Habsburg and myself.. but it is an unbridgeable gulf. We represent irreconcilable principles.. one or the other of which must perish. You see, Porfirio.. when a monarch misrules he changes the people. When a presidente misrules.. the people change him. Marechal Bazaine, we have received word from General Diaz that Benito Juarez's answer will be in our hands at four o'clock this afternoon. How can any reliance be placed on the word of Benito Juarez? You will be tricked, Your Majesty. We don't think so. Colonel Lopez, you will arrange to deliver the message during the ceremony. 'Yes, Your Majesty.' Should it come before our appearance on the balcony with the crown prince we hope to announce to our people the end of hostilities and the establishment of peace in Mexico. The only way to establish peace, Your Majesty is to sign the decree authorizing me to take repressive measures. I told you that I shall never sign such a decree. You may withdraw, marechal. Is Augustin ready for his investiture this afternoon? Yes, Your Majesty. Has he memorized the words of his oath? Repeat them to your father. 'I am thy liegeman' 'of life and limb and earthly honor.' No message, Colonel Lopez? Not yet, Your Imperial Majesty. It shall be brought to you the moment it arrives. I am thy liegeman of life and limb and earthly honor. Here we present for your recognition 'our son..' 'His Imperial Highness Augustin' 'crown prince of Mexico.' - 'Viva Augustin!' - Viva! May I caution Your Majesty not to venture forth? - Some fanatic might attempt... - Thank you, Lopez. It is our happiness to present to you Augustin, crown prince of Mexico. His person shall be a guarantee for the future of this realm a future of peace based firmly upon unity within Mexico and not upon the presence of a foreign power. Viva! What has happened? Juaristas disguised as citizens have overcome the guards and blown up the powder magazine! There's your answer from Juarez. Marechal.. the decree. 'It says that all republicans' 'taken prisoner will be shot.' 'It says that all people' 'found with arms in their houses' 'will be condemned and put to death' 'within 24 hours. It says..' Have mercy on us. Deliver us from the emperor who killed my son.. through his unholy decree. Viva Benito Juarez! Look and remember. Halt! The guards! Camilo, come quickly. It's your boy, Pepe. We found him wounded on the road to Chihuahua. Pepe! Pepe! Take me.. to Don Benito. Don Benito.. the French took Chihuahua. 'They burned the houses.' They shot the men. They said.. it was the law.. '...because..' because it is written here.. all men with arms.. His excellency Mr. John Bigelow minister from The United States of North America. Please. Your excellency will forgive the informality of this reception. Monsieur Meissonier's canvas must be completed for the opening of the salon. He insists. It seemed more important to comply with your excellency's urgent request for an audience than to stand on ceremony. Undoubtedly, Your Majesty. Be seated. Now continue. 'I have been instructed from Washington' 'by the secretary of state... ' Ah, that excellent Monsieur Seward. I've been instructed to ask you why the French flag is still in Mexico? And what is your connection with the Archduke Maximilian who calls himself emperor of Mexico? Um, um.. T-t-the archduke is an Austrian, of course and claims independent sovereignty. The French troops aided him to maintain order only so that the collection of debts might be made. But Your Majesty is aware that under the Monroe Doctrine... I do not see how the Monroe Doctrine has any bearing on the present circumstances in Mexico. My government takes a contrary view and is now prepared to enforce it if necessary. General Grant has been ordered to concentrate four army corps on the Mexican border. Uh, how soon will Your Majesty's collections in Mexico be completed? Shortly, very shortly. The matter would appear to all intents and purposes to be approaching a conclusion. It is to be hoped so, Your Majesty since my government has sanctioned the raising of a $30 million loan for the equipment of the Republican Armies of Mexico. Good day, sire. 'And another shipment of field guns' 'rifles and gunpowder.' We may consider the equipment for the army of the north as complete, then, General Escobedo. It will be complete as soon as General Carbajal takes over 10 more batteries of American field guns at Matamoros. Senor Presidente, your message to the people regarding help from the United States is ready for your signature. Don Benito, you cannot sign it. Why not? Because your term of office has expired. You have no legal power to act. 'You no longer are presidente.' What are you saying? Senor Uradi has in mind the, the constitutional provision that in the absence of an election the vice presidente shall succeed to the presidency. I defer to Don Benito in all things relating to the constitution since he wrote it. The date for a presidential election is, however, some five months past. H-how could an election have been held with most of the country in the hands of the enemy? And why did you make no mention of this matter before now, Senor Vice presidente? Is it because you preferred to sit back and wait until the plum was ripe for picking? It is not the question of my aspiring to the office but whoever holds it must have the power to act with absolute legality if the country's affairs are to be carried on. What you forget, senor is that when the congress was forced to disband it bestowed unlimited powers upon Senor Juarez to protect the constitution of Mexico. He cannot relieve himself of that duty until it is possible for the congress to meet again. Don Benito do you consider that such powers were intended to extend beyond your legal term of office? - I do. - Hm. Others will challenge that opinion. If you dare to jeopardize the cause for your own personal ambition I'll let the breath out of your throat. Porfirio! You must not misunderstand Alejandro. The question he raises cannot be answered with bitterness. You must respect his sincerity for he is a companero an old friend of the cause. He would do nothing to betray it now. Is that not so, Alejandro? Why, of course, Don Benito. Max! Max, good news. Your Majesty, Uradi has broken away from Juarez. The enemy armies are in rebellion. Has this been verified, colonel? Yes, Your Majesty, Uradi has captured the Juarista munitions base at Matamoros and all the supplies from the United States are pouring into his hands. This is our opportunity. Bazaine will strike now and bring hostilities to an end. Thank you, colonel, thank you. Your Majesties. Maxl.. - This means victory. - Yes, victory. And it's through your faith, Carla. It is your own faith which is to be thanked for what's happened, Maxl. Marechal, we have already heard the news. The enemy's at your mercy. No doubt you're leaving for the north immediately to deliver the final blow in person. With Your Majesty's permission. Do you know what this letter contains, marechal? I have some idea, Your Majesty. My orders are to concentrate all French troops for the immediate evacuation of Mexico. Infamous! Do you mean that you will withdraw your forces at the very moment when complete victory is within your grasp? I am a soldier, Your Majesty, and must obey orders. Your emperor has no power to withdraw without our consent. We deny his authority to do so and we refuse to receive his communication. There is a treaty between Napoleon and ourselves the Treaty of Miramar.. which guarantees that French troops will remain in Mexico until the empire has been made secure. That is between Your Majesty and my imperial master. It cannot affect my actions. So you would leave us at the mercy of our enemies? There is no question of being left to the mercy of enemies. His Majesty can abdicate and leave Mexico under the protection of the French Army. Monsieur le Marechal since signing the decree I have a responsibility to Mexico which may not be shirked a responsibility for the slaughter in which you indulged under the authority of my name. No, I shall not abdicate! Nor will you evacuate Mexico Monsieur Marechal because I am going to Paris to confront your Napoleon with his obligations under the Treaty of Miramar because if he refuses to live up to them I shall expose him before the courts of Europe because I shall tell the world how he lured us to Mexico with misrepresentation and false promises how he used the name of Habsburg to give face to a shady enterprise because it will be the ruin of your master Monsieur Marechal, if you dare move a man! Those are my instructions, Imperial... Marechal! You have our leave to go. Maxl.. you are not at fault for anything. It was I who said, accept the crown.. and it was I who said, do not abdicate. I alone am responsible. And I will help you now. I must go to Paris immediately. - Carlota, I can't... - It must be that way. It must be! It will not be for long, Maxl. I can't imagine existence without you. Our thoughts will bridge the distance between us. My own will never leave you. Open your soul to me and I shall be with you kneeling beside you in the chapel riding beside you in the park every morning.. and walking beside you at dusk on the terrace. My soul shall always be open to your love, Carla. Goodbye. Bye, mama. Goodbye! - Goodbye. - Bye. Goodbye, little Augustin. Don't spoil him too much. And, Maxl, promise me you'll obey Basch. Be careful of your health in every way. - Promise? - I promise. Take your quinine regularly. Goodbye. Adelante. - Buenos dias, Tejada. - Buenos dias. You arrived at an evil hour, Senor Tejada. The munitions you purchased for us in the United States have been seized by Uradi who has proclaimed himself... I have heard all, companero. So.. Uradi is a traitor. We must attack Matamoros at once. No, Carbajal. Without munitions, we should be defenseless in a few days. Our forces will be dispersed and it will be the end of the republican cause. We could go back to our guerrilla warfare. With two claiming the presidency we should be divided from within and discredited without. We will not go down without a fight, whomever we fight. There is only one hope, senores. What hope, Don Benito? That I go to Matamoros alone. 'To Uradi?' - 'For what purpose?' - We shall see. It'll be like an ant walking into the nest of a tarantula. He will kill you, Don Benito. That may be. I, Alejandro Uradi Presidente of the Republic of Mexico.. guarantee the true spirit of constitutional government. What did I say? Read it back to me. Senor Presidente! Benito Juarez is here. You mean, we are being attacked? No, Senor Presidente. He is here alone. - Alone? - Except his coachman. Are you out of your senses? I spoke to him, he wants to see you! Call my military staff! El Presidente Juarez! This is some kind of a trick! Perhaps he's come to make a bargain with you. Juarez does not bargain. I tell you it's a trick! Why should he put his life into your hands? He must know he will never get away alive. You are right, general. He will never get away alive. El Senor Juarez. Don Benito Juarez. - He must be mad to come here. - They will kill him. Here he comes, with the crowd, toward the plaza. They must be kept away. General Negroni. - Fire if need be. - On the townspeople? They must be kept off the plaza whatever lengths we have to go. - Do you hear? - Yes, Senor Presidente. Halt or we'll fire! Aim! 'Aim!' Fire! 'Fire!' 'Fire, you fools!' 'Fire!' What's the matter? What's the matter? Why don't they fire? Fire! Fire! - He's coming in here. - I don't want him to come here! Bar all doors! Senor Uradi accuses me of misusing the extraordinary powers bestowed by congress.. to establish myself as a dictator. He accuses me of sacrificing the cause of the Republic to my own vanity and ambition. I have come here to confront Senor Uradi in the presence of you all.. so that you yourselves may judge. Command him to come out. Uradi, come out! Are you a coward? If you don't come out, we'll drag you out! Come out and answer! You must go out. You've got to face him. Senor Uradi I have come here to denounce you as a traitor before the people whom you have deceived. You have conspired with Senor Montares and his landowners to betray the Republic. You are receiving their support. And the price you have agreed to pay is the lands of the peons. He lies, amigos! It is a trick! What proof has he to offer? The proof that I now stand here before you, compatriotes. For would you not kill the one you believe has betrayed you? Arrest him. I said, arrest him! 'Viva Benito Juarez!' No, no, no. Louis, she will never be persuaded to leave Paris without seeing you. No! Her presence here is an incredible menace. If the public learned the truth about Mexico now there would be barricades in the streets. We must get rid of her. Let her go to her brother in Brussels the Austrian court, anywhere. Louis, it's you and I who must leave immediately before she can present herself for an audience. Quite. Arrange for a bulletin in the court gazette Monsieur le Duc advising that His Majesty left for Vichy this evening at the insistence of his physicians. For an indefinite stay, de Morny. Get out of my way! How dare you! We are here, sire, upon a mission which affects Your Majesty's honor as much as our personal interest. His Majesty and the members of our council will be pleased to hear how France can further serve Your Imperial Majesty. Through living up to the terms of the treaty which induced Maximilian von Habsburg to assume the crown of Mexico. In what specific regard, Your Majesty have we failed to meet them? By instructing Marechal Bazaine's army to evacuate Mexico. Monsieur. You do not comprehend the situation, you cannot. Otherwise, you would immediately revoke the order of evacuation. The Juarista armies are all but defeated. Only a final blow remains to be struck. To avoid it would be such a criminal waste of all that's gone before plans and money and lives! 'I must disagree with Your Majesty' as to the military situation. Our position in Mexico is extremely precarious at the moment. To secure it would require heavy reinforcement. Can it be you're not aware that Uradi and his followers have revolted against Juarez? Can it be that Your Majesty has not been informed of the more recent happenings? Uradi is dead. Killed. His followers have rejoined Juarez who is now approaching San Luis Potosi. I do not believe it. If the Juaristas are at San Luis Potosi.. more than an empire is in danger. My husband's life. And knowing this you could abandon him? Answer me, sire! Regardless of my personal sentiments I am, as you see, madame in the hands of my ministers. In the hands of your ministers? Was it you or your ministers who conceived the plan to mask your infamies behind my husband's noble name? Who tricked him into accepting the throne by means of a pretended plebiscite? Who assured him of French troops and French funds until the day that the empire of Mexico could take her place among other nations? - Answer me, sire! - 'Carlota, please... ' Was it the names of your ministers which were affixed to the Treaty of Miramar? Did your ministers sign this letter? "I urge you to count upon my everlasting friendship. "You may rest assured that my support "will not fail you in the accomplishment which you are so courageously undertaking!" - Answer me, sire! - It is useless, madame. Not another franc, not another man. We are through with Mexico! What else might a Habsburg have expected from the word of a bourgeois Bonaparte! You charlatan! But you will not dare let him die! I will denounce you in every court of Europe for what you will be, a murderer! A murderer! It's poison. You're trying to poison me. He wants to poison me. He wants to poison me. No. Your Imperial Majesty. Your Imperial Majesty it is I Prince Metternich. Metternich. Prince Metternich. They want to kill me. Who wants to do such a thing? He. Who is he, Your Majesty? The evil one. He wants to poison me. But why, Your Majesty? Because he is afraid I will tell his real name. People think he is an emperor because he wears a crown on his head.. but I know better. He hates mankind. His purpose is to debase humanity to rob men of their godliness till they turn against one another and destroy themselves like beasts. Goodbye, um.. I must go to my husband quickly and tell him all I know. Only he has the power and the virtue to overthrow the evil one. Your Majesty. A cup of bouillon. You see, Prince Metternich how he is everywhere to poison me. Every instant I am in danger until I get to Maxl. Help me. Help me, Prince Metternich. Help me to get home.. to get home to my husband. I will arrange for Dr. Riedel of Vienna to come here immediately. 'Maxl.' 'Maxl, Maxl!' It's cold in this room. Shall I light the fire? I-if you please. Your Majesty, I'm intruding against your orders. Very well, I am intruding, but it is my duty. Then discharge your duty, Monsieur le Marechal as briefly as possible. Your Majesty. Forget all personal resentments if you can. Take my advice for what it is worth. Four enemy armies are converging upon you. All that will stand between them and the capital when we are gone are your native Mexican brigades. The empire is doomed, Your Majesty. I tell you as a soldier, your fight is lost. Abdicate. We shall not abdicate. Your Imperial Majesty.. adieu. The post, Your Majesty. At last. I hope the empress' letter will influence you toward abandoning this most unhappy venture. It's my duty to remain, Samuel. There's nothing here from Her Majesty. "Metternich?" Samuel.. have you ever heard of a Dr. Riedel of Vienna? Yes, indeed, Your Majesty. He is the most celebrated European specialist in mental diseases. What is it? Oh.. Carlota. Carlota. 'Your Majesty.' The dream. The dream I had last night.. I was in the midst of darkness. And out of the darkness.. her voice.. "Maxl, Maxl.." repeated over and over again as if in terror. I answered her.. but she couldn't hear me. I know she couldn't hear me because the cries were repeated in the same tone of terror. "Maxl! Maxl!" I shall come, liebchen. We shall sail for Europe as soon as my abdication can be arranged. "We, Maximilian von Habsburg "archduke of Austria.. "do hereby renounce for ourselves and our heirs "all right, title and claim to the throne of Mexico forever." Good faithful, Lopez. Your Majesty, I do not weep alone. Tomas Mejia, the Indian.. he weeps. Does Your Majesty know what that means.. tears from an Indian? Why, even as children they do not cry. Yes, Tomas Mejia weeps forgetful of his certain fate only out of sorrow at his loss. His certain fate? What do you mean, Lopez? Surely Your Majesty realizes what is in store for Tomas Mejia Miguel Miramon, Marquez, Mendes.. and all of us who would lay down our lives for Your Majesty. What? Does Your Majesty not realize what will happen when you have departed? Our cause will collapse for lack of the one person who can hold it together. Without a cause, there can be no unity. Our forces will scatter. And Juarez.. Juarez will relentlessly pursue and find and kill each one of us. Your Majesty! Basch, I have been blind to my true responsibilities. It took Lopez here to open my eyes. My love for my wife because of it, I would have deserted the cause for which she has already given more than her life. What cause? It suited the purposes of other people for you to think there was a cause. From first to last you've been deceived deceived by everybody, yourself included! Basch, please. You're being induced to jeopardize your life! Exactly, Basch. And is it not the sacred duty of a monarch to sacrifice his life for his people? Your people? What have you to do with Mexico? You're an Austrian! Your single duty is toward yourself and your wife! Dr. Basch, you forget yourself. You may withdraw. Senores, it is our decision to remain amongst you. - VivaMaximiliano! - Viva! - Viva el emperador! - Viva! We shall seek a final and decisive action with Benito Juarez.. which shall decide the fate of Mexico, once and forever. General Miramon? Your Majesty, I beg to report that my command was engaged by Porfirio Diaz and that these are its sole survivors. Diaz surprised us at San Lorenzo and was on us slaughtering us before we even knew who he was. His advance guard is on our heels. Then our line of retreat is cut! We are trapped, Your Majesty. Well, senores? Assault, I say. Let us cut our way out. That is impossible! We shall all be killed! Some of us will get through those who die will die like soldiers. Then let the men decide for themselves. It is my express command they be told there is no dishonor if they choose to remain behind. Take only those who volunteer. Your Majesty, what you are contemplating is certain death. There's a better way. Your Majesty and all the others can steal through the enemy lines disguised as peons. I know that you speak out of love for me, Lopez but what you suggest is not possible. I implore, Your Majesty. Senores, make all arrangements for an attack at midnight but first.. let's dine together. I have a few bottles of wine left. We'll take this occasion to open them. Good evening, senores. Your Majesty. Surely Your Majesty doesn't intend wearing a white uniform in the attack I do. But it will make you the target of every rifle. Uh, who is missing? Colonel Lopez, Your Majesty. Where is he? Halt! Who goes there? 'Colonel Miguel Lopez and patrol.' Advance and be recognized! Pass, Colonel Lopez. To Mexico. - Viva Mexico! - Viva. - Viva el emperador. - Viva. The wine is cloudy and disturbed. I know that wine in the bottle is affected by the change of seasons but the Mexican vines are not in flower now are they, General Miramon? No, Your Majesty. They were in flower a month ago. They're flowering along the Danube, though. Hm, well, of course they are, Basch but how does that affect the wine in my glass? This is the first vintage of the mature Austrian vine Your Majesty planted in Mexico. Uh, yes, I know but why do they not respond to the seasons of Mexico instead of to those of a land thousands of miles away? Because a vine is a living thing, Your Majesty and no matter how far a plant is carried something of its homeland, its sun, its soil its seasons, will remain in the vine and the wine from the vine forever. Quick! The enemy's below! 'Save His Majesty!' Surrender your arms! General, the officers of my following are guilty of nothing but doing their duty. I ask that they be spared all harm. I do not know you, senor. I am the emperor. There is no emperor in Mexico. Companeros, let these two senorespass. They are citizens. You, Lopez? Yes, Your Majesty. It was I who betrayed the city.. to save your life. Come, Your Majesty. Our escape is prepared. Hurry. General, remain in charge. Sir? I demand that you accept my sword. I am Maximilian von Habsburg. Mariano Escobedo, commander in chief. I am your prisoner. 'Senor Presidente, I beg to report' that the city of Queretaro has fallen that the Archduke Maximiliano is a prisoner in our hands. It is the sword of a Habsburg, Senor Presidente. It is the sword of a descendant of Charles V whose armies first conquered Mexico. And we must not forget, Don Benito it is also the sword of a man who decreed that those taken with arms in their possession should die within 24 hours. Maximiliano von Habsburg will be judged according to the laws of the Republic of Mexico. General Diaz. You will be responsible for the custody of the prisoner. "It is the verdict of the court "that the accused, Maximiliano von Habsburg "is guilty of having accepted the crown of Mexico "from a fraudulent minority. "He's guilty of having usurped "the sovereignty of the Mexican nation "and laid waste the territories. "He's guilty of having engaged "in a war of conquest against the Republic "aided by generals Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia. "And finally, he's guilty of open rebellion '"against the lawful government.' '"Therefore, the said Maximiliano von Habsburg' "is sentenced to be executed at dawn "by a military firing party on the 19th day of June, 1867." And may God have mercy upon his soul. 'So instead of the priest comforting Maximiliano' 'it was Maximiliano who comforted the priest.' Senor Juarez. You cannot let him die. He is not guilty in his soul. The only accusation to be made against him.. is that he was deceived by others. He prays that after all the blood that has been shed in Mexico his may be the last to flow and begs you to extend clemency toward Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia. Is that all? That is all. Archduke Maximiliano it is my duty to inform you that the president of the Republic has refused to sign the pardon 'that the sentence is ordered to be executed' 'tomorrow morning at dawn.' What about Miramon and Mejia? Their sentence will be carried out at the same time. Is there anything I can do for you? Nothing. Wait. Uh.. There is a song I should like to hear again. "La Paloma" is its name. It, uh.. It was a favorite of my wife's. Would that be possible? I can't believe it. How can Juarez refuse? Because he is honest. If he were otherwise.. ambitious, self-seeking.. he would have set me free and won the plaudits of the world. But Juarez is honest. My dying proves that he is honest. Alto! Maxl. Maxl! 'Enfrente!' Has Your Highness anything to say? Distribute this money among your men, captain. Ask them to aim at my heart. Tomen armas! Preparen! Apunten! 'Fuego!' Forgive me.
