Tell me what's wrong. Is this about your dialysis? Are you alright? Come home. Dad. Is this about the destabilization? Aren't we used to it yet? Seven assassination attempts. A dozen coups d'etat. What difference does any of it make? No, I just want to spend time with you. Dad. Just come home. Now. What did he say? - We're going home. - When? Right now. Borgy.

Pirated weapons to the camp housing the nation's defense ministry. The defense minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, and the deputy chief-of-staff, Gen. Fidel Ramos leading the reformists and decided on mutiny against Pres. Marcos. As of now, I cannot, in conscience, recognize the president as the commander in chief of the armed forces. I call upon now, everyone, who is... imbued with the sense of justice and... and, respect for the law, to disobey the orders given to them. While the drama in Manila was unfolding, Aquino was in the southern city of Cebu. Continuing a post-election campaign advocating civil disobedience. Despite the noise outside the palace and along EDSA, As loyal soldiers surround the Malacanang Complex, The Marcoses remain indoors with select staff and the PSC, acutely sensitive to any new developments. Chapter One: Rebel Good afternoon, Ma'am. - Good afternoon, Ma'am. - Good afternoon. Where's Dad? Have you had lunch yet? Why haven't these been distributed yet? They thought you were going to give those away. Why are you back so soon? What did the doctors say? All of a sudden, you're anemic. I haven't been to the doctors yet. Dad sent me home right away. Is this supposed to be my job, too? The election's long over, we still haven't paid the watchers, coordinators, and barangay officials? How do you expect to get future favors? I already told you! It's not a bribe. Why are you so scared to touch it? It's all for their trouble. For their time! For Christ's sake! People shouldn't be kept waiting! If Bonget and I do that, and it's not according to your preferences, you'll just get mad at us. We're not familiar with your style of doing things. Not like we don't want to do it. We just don't know how you do it. So you better do it yourself. That way, nobody gets upset. What's that you're wearing? Where are you going? How bad is it? - Dear. - Dear, I was only able to buy these. I was in a hurry so I went back as fast as I could. Besides, why are there so many people outside? I thought they were in Edsa. There's a rally in Edsa, there's one here, too. Where are you going? Why are you dressed like that? And you, why are you dressed like that? Won't your son grab your earring, Imee? And where's the other half of the pair? Imee, I think the cross is upside down. Mommy, that's the style. Madonna's a bit rebellious. Just like you. The rebel's here. Let her in! Ah! You remembered what I told you. Would you like a bowl of soup? Have a little something to eat. I'm fine. Dad? What do you want me to do? Dad, what are we going to do? Depends on what you want to do. Are you asking me because you can't think of anything? Or you want to know if we're thinking the same thing? I'm asking you because I don't want to think anymore. You don't want to think because if you do, you're worried you might hurt those who betrayed you. Who? All of them! Those shameless sons of bitches! Oh, my darling. It's true! Now that they know you're sick, they're putting on airs to the media? In America? Imee. They're all getting restless. They can't wait to replace you, dad, because you did not listen to me. Listen to me. Johnny is not even listening to you. Why is Ramos itching to have a seat? Johnny? We just haven't spoken in a while. Call Johnny! Yes, sir. Miss Lucy, don't call him. Don't call Enrile. You already offered him a pardon. He already refused it. Meaning he really meant to go against you. Why are you so hot-headed? They are only capable of striking if they have horns. That's the problem, dad. You trusted them too much. That's what they used to bring you down. Can they bring me down? Yes, they can. No, they cannot. Yes they can, dad. Because you're just sitting here. You're not doing anything. No… Because you're here now, and you'll take care of everything. Call them in. Tell them to come in here. Yes, sir. Madam. Ma'am. Sir is inviting you in the gallery. Where's Biday? Get Biday in here. We want to listen to Biday tell the story. Call her in here. Tell her to come here. Okay, sir. I'll call for her. Biday. Come in here. Sir, I already called for her. [knocking on door] What is it? Come over here. Hello, sir. Biday. Tell Imee everything that happened. Everything that happened. About what, sir? Ah, all that trouble? I don't want to, sir. Oh no, sir. I just kept the transistor on, sir. But I was busy working. I don't really pay attention to those rumours. Sometimes I would catch you talking amongst yourselves, but I don't nose around. It's not like I'm always listening to the news, sir. Just tell us what you know. Even just a little. Are you sure, sir? Stand over here. Well, at dawn, Enrile released a statement. He advised Cory to step up and be the new president of the Philippines. The loyalists, they rushed to the Veritas transmitter. And Mr. President asked for the helicopters in Crame to be dismantled so they're not of use to anybody. And then Cory! She called for a press conference in Cebu. Ma'am, I just heard this, but they say, Cory does nothing but play mahjong in Cebu together with the nuns. Also, her youngest daughter, Kristina, In the middle of the night she would get a craving for Japanese food. I'm so glad you kids aren't like that. Biday, what was said in the press con? Ah. Oh, man. She is asking Mr. President to step down. And they were encouraging the people to support Enrile, Ramos, and other insurgents. They're telling people to gather in Edsa. Mr. President gave orders to stop the protesters in Edsa but they're standing their ground. Cory arrived in Manila just moments ago. And while Enrile, Ramos, are strengthening their forces in Crame, Cory marched to Edsa. She confronted the marines, and the tanks that were all lined up to make a... The... The tanks were lined up like that, like-- To keep people from getting past. And a few hours ago, ma'am, before you landed, Mr. President already phoned Enrile. He told him to stop all this. He even offered him absolute pardon. But Enrile refused it! Also, before we came downstairs to welcome you, I should have cleaned up your room. Because among the presidential children, you're the only one who doesn't live here. You don't live here, yeah? But I don't have the key. I couldn't find it. I was asking around for the key. It turns out, Santa's keeping it to herself and using your room as a motel-- Ouch! You bitch! That hurts. Why'd you pull my hair! Give it to me. What? I wasn't hiding it. I wasn't hiding it. I'm just keeping it safe. You and Biday are thinking up all sorts of things. Here, you're so malicious. You need to be sworn in. Inauguration? If you're sworn in, that will put a stop to their delusions. But how? Who will preside over it? Where is General Ver? Tell him to call up a Chief Justice. Find another way. I don't like Fabian's suggestion. What does he want? Ask Bonget. Bonget. Where are you going? Why are you dressed like that? Ime, don't you see? Mommy, Daddy, they're not like that. They're just letting it happen! Bonget! No, no. Come. Come with me. Come with me. Let's eat. At our table in the kitchen. Come on. So you can rest up, too. Come on. Part of an aborted coup d'etat, and assassination plot against the president and the first lady. One of the suspects is Col. Ricardo Morales. Imelda Marcos' aide-de-camp. We would be coming from the Pasig river at the back. We would cross by inflatable boats. and then assault the palace from the riverside. That was the plan. And... Since I knew the routes inside the palace, my job would be to, lead the assaulting area. The assault was planned at the dawn of February 23. Eight teams consisting of four soldiers are tasked to assault the palace to hold the first family captive. But on the afternoon of the 22nd. The coup was revealed. The Presidential Security Command held Col. Morales captive. President Marcos then presented the captured soldiers to the media. Telling that this was a power grab initiated by Ramos and Honasan. To be honest, history is mocking us. At that time, the people do not believe in Pres. Marcos anymore. They thought that I planted a convenient scapegoat. The Marcos children did not fail to notice the inexplicable calm with which their parents faced the circumstances, possibly from sadness, disappointment, or shock from the onslaught of violence against their trust and confidence. Until everything was revealed to Imee, shattering the fragile peace in the palace. Chapter Two: Ilocos or Leyte It's called 'conditioning', ma'am, according to General Ver. There's one color and they show it to you over and over. Especially abroad. That's called 'conditioning', apparently. And when they make it seem like there's a lot of people, but in fact there are only a hundred, they'll say it's a thousand people who showed up. So the people who are far away will go, "Wow! How impressive, there's so many people there!" "So amazing!" Just like that. That's conditioning, ma'am. What about you imitating Mommy's hairdo, is that your conditioner? Ah, I used a spray net, ma'am. Get off my business. Miss Lucy, why don't you just put in all the chicken? Do you expect us to have a piece each? We'll have more vegetables than meat. Ma'am, there's no more supply! No more supply? What do you mean? You see, ma'am, if we use up all the meat now, tomorrow we'll have nothing to cook. Yes, but what's this about? What happened to the supply? The reason your daddy asked you to come home is because… He was almost killed here in the palace. It's Rick. You mean, Rick-- Mommy's bodyguard? Yes, ma'am. Him. Sir Bonget discovered that there's been a plot to kill you all. And their closest companion, is... Rick. Don't you treat that man like your own brother? Everyday he's by Madam Imelda's side. It makes my skin crawl! They've been planning it for weeks, you know? That they'll surround Malacañang and have you cornered. And then, they'll kill you. Ma'am, this is sir Johnny we're talking about. Sir Johnny! You almost eat off of one plate, ma'am! Only then did we find out that they managed to slip in other helpers in the palace. Another maid? You got it, ma'am. They took all our food, everything that's in the fridge… All the cabinets, those heartless runts ransacked the whole pantry! Ma'am, all the supplies were thrown into the river. Good thing Biday has amphibious traits. She was able to rescue some bags of food. You see, ma'am, I couldn't get to all the bags because I don't know how to swim. I had a traumatic experience in Pagudpud. But even if I knew how to swim, I wouldn't jump in there. Pasig River is nasty! - So I just took-- - Which of the maids? We're so glad sir Reggie could go out and buy groceries. But ma'am, our supply won't last beyond today. Ma'am, if you like, you can eat what's left of it. Don't mind us because we can hold out for longer. Oh, ma'am, no-- We can't have that, ma'am. I can't not eat after all. After that rally, they surrounded Malacanang… So we couldn't go out. We couldn't go to the market, we couldn't go to the shops. And now Bonget's agitated! He doesn't know who to trust here in the palace. Screw all of them! They took all of our food, even our drinks! They really want to kill us all! Ma'am, I don't-- I do not understand. They're all shameless. Your father is already sick, isn't he? The President is sick! Why are they doing this, ma'am? Daddy. Ma'am! Daddy. - Ma'am Imee. - Ma'am. - Ma'am Imee, where are you going? - I need to go to daddy. What's wrong with you? You had to puff up your stories! - Where's daddy? - Ma'am. Huh? Where's my mom? Where is everyone? Why are they doing nothing? Huh? Ma'am Imee… What the hell? I've only been gone two days. What is going on here? - Wait, Ma'am Imee. - Where are my siblings? - Wait, Ma'am Imee. - Where are my siblings? Why? What's wrong? Where is Bonget? Huh? - Where is Bonget? - I don't know. - Irene, you know nothing! - I don't know where he is. Irene, you don't know anything! Bonget! - What's going on? - Bongbong! - What's wrong? - Where's mommy? Where's daddy? Why do you want to know? - Ma'am Imee. - Mommy? Daddy! Ime, what is it? Imee, what's going on? Imee, what's going on? You. Why haven't I seen you before? What's your name? - Pagadungan, ma'am. - Pagadungan? Lucas, ma'am. Ilocos or Leyte, which is it? Ilocos, madam. Imee. Where in Ilocos? In Sarat, madam. You're the one who granted my scholarship, madam. You were with the president. Please, Imee. You were the one who gave me money for my wedding. Ime. Ime, why?! - Daddy! - Daddy is in the treatment room! Daddy! Why are you shouting? What's going on, Imee? - Where is daddy? - I told you, he's in the treatment room. Mommy. What's wrong? Daddy. What's the matter? You. Show me your license. - Let me see. - Ma'am, it's here. Imee. - Give it to me. Let me see. - What's happening? Why? Imee? Imee, she's our regular nurse. Are you sure? - That's our nurse. - Yes. - Are you sure? Do you really know her? - Yes, I'm sure. Here. Mommy, look at this. Look at your daddy's medicine. Look. Do you see daddy's medicine? Is this how they look, mommy? Huh? Bongbong. Check everything. Irene! Mommy! Help me! They're probably poisoning my father! We can't distinguish between people we can and can't trust here in the palace. Help me! Imee, that's enough. Sister, that's enough. - Daddy! - What's going on? They might be poisoning you! How dare they! Traitors! I can't believe they would do this! Stop it! Why are you always angry? Can you calm down? Because of that! You are always too nice! That's exactly it. That's what they used to bring you down, Dad! You trust too easily! You gave them free rein! You'll cut yourself! That's enough. You're just making me feel worse. - Stop! - Jesus, stop! - I feel even more terrible, darling. - That's enough. Please, enough. Dad, sorry! Sorry! I'm here, dad. I am here. I am here now. I won't leave you, dad. I won't leave you, okay? - I got a long distance telephone advise. - Yes. That president Marcos or ex-president Marcos was seen In Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. And there's even news in Guam, telling that Marcos is there. Okay. Thank you, Frank. One of the lies that were peddled was that the Marcoses have fled to Guam, suggesting that they escaped Malacañang to preserve themselves, in order to provoke and anger the innocent and raid the palace. and become poor victims in case the government fights back. At 9 in the morning Pres. Marcos appeared on live television. I understand you gave them orders to wait. - I told them to wait-- - There's many civilians near our troops. and we cannot keep on withdrawing. because that's what we did yesterday. When I talked to Mr. Enrile, He was firm. My order is to disperse the crowd without shooting them No, no. You disperse the crowd without shooting them. President Marcos held a press conference to show that they never left the palace and that even though a bomb was set off in one of the garages of Malacanang, he stood firm against violent retaliation. Chapter Three: The Tiger Around 6:30 in the morning, the woman on the radio said something about the Marcoses being gone. - Huh? - Yes. How's that possible? Are we talking to apparitions, then? - That's a scary thought. - Let me help you. No, leave it. I can manage. Just man your position. I'm okay. This is what I do not understand. They keep saying it's the Marcos that will attack first. Where? Where? They're the ones selling this whole "peaceful revolution" thing. Peaceful revolution but they bombed us yesterday! They turned Greggy's car into a tin can. Right. What's going to happen? We lost Reagan, too. He's turned his back on us. - It's over. - So you did get to buy some food. We didn’t buy these. The people who live nearby gave these to us. Most of them have run away. Yes, sir. Feels a lot like wartime. They already left. What else do you have there? I have cured meats, garlic pork sausages, and some condiments. I have canned goods. This should be enough for 30 people. This should be enough for 30 people. - There's 32 of us. - 32? Ma'am, are you pregnant? You meant 31, then. Are you having twins? We sent for Aquino. - Cory? - Cory? Ninoy. - Ah. - Ah. Chief Justice Roman Aquino. He's bringing his son. Just bring something to eat because we're going to have a meeting. They might have breakfast here tomorrow because they'll stay the night. I hope we can find a way, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. Borgy's still asleep. Please go check on him but don't wake him up. Michael's with mommy. - Okay. - She says she'll look after him. - Okay. - The conference room's being cleaned out. Also, please, just take turns. We can't miss anything. Also, please prepare books for Justice later. He might get bored. - Books? - Mm. Books. Alright, let me. - Yes, there. You take care of it. - No, I'll take this. You handle that one. Go on. Hurry! You do it. You really had to send me. I hate walking these halls alone. So scary. - Hey, don't forget to greet me. - Hi, ma'am. Show some respect. I hate this. Ugh, I really hate walking in Malacañang at night. I hate this. Nanny Santa! Do we have Sarsi? Little Aimee, don’t dress in white at this hour. And why are you asking for soda? You may not have Sarsi. Go to sleep. Come on. Why are you looking for Sarsi? Go on, call out to her. "Hey, ugly!" I heard that. Don't try me. Come on. Let's get you that Sarsi. Heh, you think you're all that. You just have fair skin. Even though mine isn't as pale, I am Ilocano to the bone! We are the heroes! You're so annoying. I can't deal with you. Biday. Sir. - Sir, sorry, sir. - It's okay. Why are you here? Looking for something to read? No, sir. I am looking for books for the Chief Justice. - Chief Justice? - Yeah. Wow. The Chief Justice, sir. Sent for by-- your sister Imee. - This late? - Yes. - Whoa. - Right? That's Ma'am Imee for you. Summoning a Chief Justice at 10 o'clock in the evening. Wild, huh? Of course. She takes after daddy. If you want something, there's a way. Right? I'd have to disagree, sir. Watch out, Biday. If you say Imee takes after Mama, my sister might fire you. Jesus, no! Not at all. In truth, sir, none of you take after your parents. Because all three of you, are spoiled. Hey, that's not true. Look here, sir. I'll show you what I mean. Ma'am Imee summons a Chief Justice at 10 o'clock in the evening. That man is old, sir. See what I mean?! Now, you have the Beatles playing nonstop on max volume all the time. Every day, on and on, loud as a firetruck. I've memorized all the lyrics of their songs, sir. Let me illustrate my point further. Your poor Miss Lucy, exhausted from cleaning, yes? Now, the poor thing fell asleep on the-- She fell asleep on the couch at the reception. She was sleeping this way. You see? - What did your parents do? - What? They tiptoed as they entered. They tiptoed as they entered. Your mother removed her shoes. - Really? - Yes! Then she tiptoed. Tiptoe. Tiptoe. Tiptoe. Bongbong! Dad. - Bongbong. - Dad. We talked about this already. Your mommy and I told you, that you should change clothes for the press conference. Why did you show up in that uniform? - Dad. - Why are you still dressed like that? What is it you're trying to say? Dad, they bombed us yesterday. Do you want us to blow them up, too? Is that what you want? Dad, what I know is-- What do you know? I want to hear it. Go on. I want to hear this. What do you know. I will listen. Dad, as far as I know, they attacked us because they want to see what we can do. It's a challenge to match their strength. General Ver told me, that there are still more troops who are loyal to us in the Armed Forces. So if we answer the challenge, we will definitely win. What do you know about winning? What do you know about loyalty? Huh? When you’re always out partying, you’re always away, you are always in the club! Rather than join me and your mother in government affairs. Why? Why, have you ever won anything on your own? Have you? Have you ever won anything by your own efforts? Ask yourself. What have you accomplished? Do you have a friend you know is trustworthy? You act all high and mighty! Your friends abroad, they're only hanging about because they know you are the son of a president! That's why they flock to you. Get that in your head! Dad, my friends abroad have no idea I'm a president’s son. That's why I don't want to make friends here because-- Exactly! Exactly! Exactly. So you don’t know the feeling. Because you don't know anything. You don't know who's who, you don't know what's what, you don't know the truth, you don't know who's going to have your back. You know nothing about friendship. That's the truth. How do you know that the friends you're hanging around with-- those people you're with when it's fun will still be with you when things turn ugly? Hm? You tell me. How? Are those your true friends? Huh? What Fabian told you-- He says we have a lot of loyal, honest people… Who are fighting for us. You sure? Are there really a lot of them? Are you sure? Tell me if you're certain of that. Now you're silent. You have nothing to say. You don’t know loyalty. You don’t know trust. Everyone who was on your side has gone and left you, dad. That's why I wore this uniform... to show all of them, that I'm... still here for you. Why are you making it look like I'm a bad judge of character? - No, dad! - Huh? - I didn't say that. - What are you trying to say? You're putting up a front. You wear that to make people say "Bongbong is so brave!" "He is ready to fight, kill, and die for the people!" "Bongbong's full of courage!" "There he is!" "He is ready to protect the palace!" "He's ready-he's prepared to lay down his life!" For you, dad! For mommy! For my siblings! I don’t care about the palace. You're all I care about! My family, my siblings! Your health, dad. That's all I think about! That's what this is all about! You can trust me, dad. Because I am your child! I'm your son, dad! I am your son! Why do you say I don't trust you? - How could you say that? - You said so in the letter. And to uncle back in Leyte. You said something like, you don't know what to do with me. You said, that among your children-- You seem disappointed in me. I was still young back then, dad. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. It's as Imee says, boys mature later than girls. I'm not like you, dad. As a young man, you knew immediately what you want in life. You had your life planned out even as a little boy. My sisters- They already have families of their own. Now, dad, you, mommy-- you're my family. I don't want you to think that you can't trust me, that you can't rely on me, dad. That's why I put this on. I put on this uniform to show you that I'm ready. I know now. I'm ready. I know what I want! What do you want? What do you want? To make you proud, dad. Because you don't seem proud of me, dad. I am very proud of you. I'm so proud of you. I just want you to be proud of me. I just want you to be proud of me, dad. You don't seem proud of me. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. I just don't say it. I cannot fight the Filipino people Which I've been fighting for all my life. Today, while Cory was proclaimed president. Mr. Marcos, too, was trying to hold on. He organized his own presidential inauguration at Malacañang. But by then, many of his stalwarts were afraid to turn up. These were the last rites for the Marcos dictatorship. His wife Imelda, sang "Just for You." But Mr. Marcos' attempt to have his inauguration televised live to the nation, came unstaffed. And now, ladies and gentlemen. The moment you've all been waiting for. The administration of the oath of office... of his Excellency, President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Moments later, that broadcast was cut off. Though thousands of supporters came to attend the inauguration, nothing could stifle the sound of trembling ground beneath their feet because they know that the rebellion is steadily gaining strength, that the media are aggressively making noise inside and outside the country such that even the oath-taking was not allowed to be aired. In these remaining hours, they are all but certain the palace will be overrun. The Marcos children set out to convince their parents to save themselves and those whom they consider their real treasures. Chapter Four: Songs and Snakes Would you look at that. Amidst all the chaos, here we are, eating caviar. Too bad, Lucy. I don't eat that. I didn't know you avoided certain food. Actually, sir, I'm not a picky eater. Would you like me to-- But back at the inauguration, I thought you asked the attendees to bring food. They didn't bring much. Because during the ceremony, the broadcast was interrupted. They had to take care of that first. Then the people dispersed. So where's the food? I gave it all to PSC. Everything? Yes, they'll need it. They will have a long night. What do you mean? How does that work, ma'am Imee? Old man was inaugurated, but so was Cory? So... Will there be a tie-breaker? No, silly. There's no tie. They didn't win. Didn’t Cory win at NAMFREL, then Old Man at Comelec? No. Didn’t they walk out? What time is it? 4:30 p.m. Call the embassy. Ask them who's coming to get us. Helicopter, speedboat, just let us know. What about mommy? Imeng. Have you talked to them yet? Daddy won't leave here. Bonget, believe me, when we leave, the couple has no choice but to come with us. They won't stay behind. Besides, I can't let us live like this. Especially my kids. Why do we have to leave anyway? Is there any reason not to? They have the military on their side. They are supported by some countries. And America. Do you think daddy will still fight? If we're not going to fight back, we should at least be safe. I don't understand them anymore. Especially mommy. They are too quiet. I'll talk to them now. Nanny Santa. Please pack all my things. All of ours. Miss Lucy, please tell everyone. Pack all the essentials. But-- Where will we go? To Ilocos. Let's go home to Ilocos. ♪ All my life I've suffered ♪ ♪ the hardship and the torment ♪ ♪ of a heart that loves ♪ ♪ yet there's no sign of heaven ♪ ♪ Now I know joy ♪ ♪ When you saved me from my anguish ♪ ♪ Only you, darling ♪ ♪ My only hope ♪ ♪ Because of you ♪ ♪ I yearn to live ♪ ♪ Because of you ♪ ♪ until I die ♪ ♪ You must realize ♪ ♪ I love no one else ♪ ♪ If you asked my heart It speaks only your name ♪ ♪ Because of you ♪ ♪ I am full of gladness ♪ ♪ I will love and support you ♪ ♪ To prove that I am true ♪ ♪ Let me serve you ♪ ♪ Everything in life is dear because of you ♪ ♪ To prove that I am true, let me serve you ♪ Everything in life is dear because of you.... Biday? What are you doing here? I thought the record was playing. But it's you. Sorry I choked, ma'am. I could do it over from the top. Biday? Pack up. All the stuff back there. All the valuables in the office. - Yes, ma'am. - Hurry up. Excuse me. Soon, the speedboat will arrive. Speedboat? I thought a helicopter would pick us up? Mommy, we're taking the helicopter. Our luggage will be hauled onto the speedboat. You'll entrust our things to strangers? What else are we going to lose, mommy? I no longer think of what we're losing. I was just thinking about what else they could possibly drop on us. Or add to further ruin our name. I stopped thinking about that. The important thing is we get out of this place. And where would we go? Cory will not allow us to stay in the Philippines. So your plan to go back to Ilocos… It will not happen. We can't stay, mommy. Okay? Anywhere but here. I don't know if your daddy and I can leave like this. This is a den of snakes! Snakes that your daddy and I tamed. Mommy, not all snakes who slither beside you wants your company and coddling. Some of them come to size you up, to see if they can swallow you whole. Your days of fraternizing with snakes are over. They've coiled around our necks. They're just waiting for the right time to strike the fatal blow. This is where your daddy and I will die. None of us will die here. I won't leave you and daddy. I'll take you away whether you like it or not. Chapter Five: The Youngest - Where's daddy? - Where's mommy? Sir is in his office, ma'am. Irene, come with me to daddy. Let's convince him. Bonget, mommy is inside. I'll leave her to you. All right. Nanny, call all the staff, helpers, PSC. Tell them to get dressed and to take off their uniforms. Let's all meet in the receiving hall. Got it, ma'am. Why do we need to change? Just do it. Go on, I'll meet you all later. Dad. What are you doing here? Well, I could ask you the same thing. I'm surprised you came in here without your sister. Why? Are you sick of Imee's yapping? No… Not at all. I'm the one who asked her to come home. You know that your sister's voice is music to my ears. But at least when she's not here, I can cough. And be out of breath. Why, doesn't she like hearing you cough? It's not that. She doesn't like to see me in pain. We're so much alike, aren't we? I don't know. Sometimes, she's like mommy, sometimes she's just like you. But of course she'd like that. She insists that she takes after you. You are both stubborn. Dad. Let's go. Let's leave this place. I'm getting scared. What are you afraid of? Of what they can do to you. What else can they do to me? I feel like a fading candle in here. Don't say that, dad. Is that why you're not scared? Is that why you're fine with dying in here? I'm always scared. That's why I'm always brave, darling. Dad, what about me? Dad, I'm not as brave as you. I’m not as brave as Imee either. Dad, please. Dad, I don’t want you to die here. Please, for the sake of my siblings. Dad, please. For your grandchildren, dad. Come on, let's leave right now. Please. How will I... ever face my-- My grandchildren when the time comes? When they find out that their grandfather was-- Their grandfather who was a soldier, ran away, surrendered in battle. They say that we left the palace. Dad. Dad, that's not what they'll think. That’s not what they'll find out... because I will make sure.. that the truth will come out. And history itself will tell your grandchildren who you really are. Tell me this, then. Am I a bad person? Be honest with me. Am I a bad person? Dad, why are you thinking that? You're not! You're not a bad person, dad! Why would you think that? Dad, don't be ridiculous. You're not a bad person. Dad, I know-- I know that you did everything you thought was right. But dad, no government is perfect. Remember that, dad. It's not your fault that the world's full of greedy opportunists. You don’t control the minds of those in office and more importantly, you'll always keep us from harm. All those who took advantage of you, all those who betrayed you, dad, it's not your fault. No. Don't think that. They're so angry. Because we do not come from... an elitist clan. They are so angry. They are very angry with us because we're simple countryfolk. They are very angry because... the people love us. But... I can't get mad at them. I can't get mad at them. Dad, that's enough. That's enough, dad. Stop. Dad, me... Your whole family. We won't leave you, dad. So please, let us take care of you, dad. Please, dad, let's go. It's over, dad. Chapter Six: Lullaby I thought we were on the same side. Why does it seem like you're taking Imee's side now? I'm not! Mommy. Imee and dad's teaming up for sure. They always get along. But the two of us-- We're solid. What about Irene? Whose side do you think she's on? Irene? Maybe with baby Aimee. What happens if they find you in here? What if they hurt you? Yeah, what if they do hurt me? All I know is, I'll never let them hurt you. What if there's a lot of them? What if we can't take them on? Is there anything Imelda Romualdez Marcos can't survive? Yes. Losing you and your daddy. I feel the same way, mommy. I don't want that to happen. So while we still can, let's get out of here. You don't understand, Bonget. Daddy and I did everything for this country after the war. Just to be discredited by those who want power. If we leave the palace, it should not be like we're running away. What about our dignity? Mommy, like all of our challenges, we'll overcome this. Together. No. If we leave here, remember, we can never go back. They will do anything to ruin our name. So the Filipinos will despise us. Remember, if we let them stake us out, we can never go back. That's not true, mommy. It's the truth. We can't go back. We can never come back here. Mommy, no. Mommy. We can never come back. Mommy. Listen to me. I promise, I don’t know how, - I do not know when. - We can never come back. Mommy, listen. - We can never come back. - Yes, we will. We will come back. - We can never come back. - Mommy. Mommy, we will come back. - We can never come back here. - We can go back, mommy. We can come back. We can come back. We can come back. We can come back. Mommy, listen. We can come back. Chapter Seven: Freeloader Now if you have no more questions, you can change out of your uniforms and we will meet in the receiving area. Bring only your belongings. Don't even think about bringing souvenirs. Where do we put our luggage? Let's put all our things together and load them on the boat. Someone will meet us on the other side. Why did they tell you they're leaving, and not us? Are you close to them? Next. Ma'am, can't we talk to them? Because we can still fight. Instead of cowering like this. Like fugitives. The Marcos family has already decided. They have no plans to retaliate. So if there is a reason why this revolution is peaceful, that's because of the Marcos family, not because of those suckers. Yes. Ma'am, if you think about it-- Now, if you're raring to fight, you can go alone. We'll cheer you from here. Next. Why don't they face us themselves? Where's ma'am Imee? We will meet at the receiving area when we've all changed. What makes you think I want to face you? You're not even doing your job right around here. All you do is flirt. - Wow, really! - All right, be quiet. No more from you. Next. But ma'am, we'll lose our jobs? We have served this family for twenty years. What will happen to our families, ma'am? Can't we go with them? I can't imagine working for someone else. The rest of you might. I hope you can tell them to just take us with them. Because if a case is filed against them, we are the closest to them. We are with them every day. We can prove that our bosses are not bad people. What if they find us here? Shouldn't we fight them back? I think we should arm ourselves. So we can defend the president and the first lady. And ourselves, especially. Hey. Hold it right there. Pull yourselves together. What do you think this is? The Katipunan? Some kind of revolution? Stop fooling around! Jesus Christ! Like all of you, I'm saddended by these events. Angry, frustrated… I feel like I want to explode. But if sir and ma'am have made their peace, who are we to object? Who are we to disobey them? We're just freeloaders here! Freeloaders who were never treated like strangers. Freeloaders who were never disrespected. Freeloaders who were loved like true members of the family. Not just us, including our families. We have no right to disobey the president. We have no right to defend people who have done nothing but fight for us. Because they don't want us to defend them anymore! Santa. Don't talk like that. You're just making it hard for them. You see, it's not that they don't want to fight. And not because they don't want us to fight for them… It's not that. They just don't want violence. They do not want to fuel all this anger. They don't want to hurt each other anymore. They're done with that. After all, what use is a government, if people are left dead and bloodied? And if we were to fight, and we end up getting beaten up? We'd all just hurt ourselves, won't we? Say that for some miracle, we win, are we certain no one will get hurt? The Marcoses are great people. Smart. But this is not what we're used to. To go against each other. And our bosses are not like that. Nor is it the time for things like who will lose, who will win, who will sit, who will rule, who will wear the fancy suits and clothes! Don't you agree? What use is a well-put-together outfit if it's torn in pieces because the nation is broken? Like the madam used to say-- Madam Imelda said, That every thread in a fabric represents the Filipino. It's never an honor to simply wear a piece of fabric, it must be sewn, stitched, and intact. Its parts must be united. We are all helpers. We help, we don't destroy. We're helpers, so... let's heed our bosses' orders. Let's help them. Let us help them both in this house and in this nation that they built. Hey. You. What are you eating? Flat tops, ma'am. Flat tops or curly tops? Flat tops, ma'am. Do you have White Rabbit? I have one more. Give it to me. Chapter Eight: Maid in Malacañang Where is that freaking hat? We've been looking all over for it. Are you ready? Are your siblings done packing? Your mommy and I have been looking for my hat. We can't find it. We also asked the maids. They don't know where it is. Alright. - I'll go check on Bonget. - Okay. I'll help him pack. You depend on the maids for everything. How do I look? What about me? What do you think of my outfit? I wore a dress. I have nothing to say about your outfit. I don't want to interfere with your fashion statement because you're the one who said, I can mess with anything but your love life. Do you regret you didn't intervene? I regret... that... you weren't strict enough with me. Don't cry. It's you who's gonna cry. Dad. Everything, even this happens for a reason. Everything happens for a reason. Those words are spoken by people who feel helpless about their situation. No, dad. It's also for people who have done all they could. You've done all that you could. God will take care of everything. God made all this happen. He paved the way for this to happen. History will judge us. If what happened was right. The day I've always dreaded has come. To be overthrown by the enemy? To fall in front of you. No, dad. Not once have you ever failed. Not in my eyes. Not in my heart. The Philippines is your triumph. I swear, dad, those living today will know, as well as the next generation that my father, whom they made to look like a monster, was a valiant soldier fortified by dinengdeng, by bananas, and by love of country. Mark my words, dad. From today... until destiny favors us… The truth will not be expunged. That you are the best president of the Philippines. And you are the best maid in Malacañang. The best maid in Malacañan. The best maid I've never paid, who knows everything, served faithfully. My darling genius of a girl. I love you, my Imee. I love you, dad. Not too tight, I might cough and you'll get angry again. I have finished everything I have prepared everything they told me to, and you're still not done packing. Do you have three thousand pairs of shoes? Why are you still packing? You slowpokes! Are you cry-- Are you crying, you drama queens? Don't swear at us, Miss Lucy. I'm not swearing. I'm just asking. I said, are you crying, you drama queens? So you are crying. No, we’re not. Why would I cry? Yes, why would I? Am I emotional? And what's so sad about packing up your things? Right. Why carry it in your chest when you already have a luggage for your things? That's crazy. What's that? This is the gift the First Lady gave us. When she gave us fur. Mine's still here. I also have mine here. It doesn't fit me anymore, though. Back then, we told her, "Ma'am, why are you giving us fur?" "It's so hot here in the Philippines!" Didn't we? And ma'am said-- Ma'am said, "The Lord said, 'Wow! You have a fur coat now, so I'll give you a chance to go to another country with snow." I said, "Ma'am, we're just the help. We don't wear things like that." And she said-- She said, "What, can't maids wear fur? Will you be stuck as maids forever? Must you lose your dignity?" "Should a maid always look like a maid?" Are you crying? I'm not-- What am I, emotional? Whoever wants to cry will get their nipple flicked. I'm game for that. I'm game. I lose. I don't have any. Just a little. Oh! Miss Lucy. Look at this. Look at this. Oh. Shouldn't this be with Delio? See. I thought sir's pilot kept these. There, look. Look. Look at it. Right there. You looked so ugly! You were so scared. Look at you, you're still ugly! Look at this. Watch it. You got your spit on me. I remember that. This was our first time to get on a plane You were terrified. You kept praying. I was really anxious when we got on the plane. You remember how Santa kept saying sorry? Praying over and over, apologizing. So in case we die on the plane, our sins will have been forgiven. I have many sins. And that's not all. You kept saying thank you, sorry, and I love you. You kept thanking sir. You kept thanking ma'am. Miss Lucy… Forgive me for all the troubles I caused you. Biday. Me, too. I'm sorry and thank you for everything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry. I love you both very much! I love you very much! Will we meet again after this? I wish. I wish. We look ugly when we cry. Chapter Nine: The Last SONA They are safe. They are with the maids. They are just waiting for us to say good bye. Tommy, leave this behind. We don't have much space. - Sorry, mommy. - Why is your shirt wet? - Borgy, come here. - Go to your daddy. Biday? Could you put this away? See if you can squeeze it into the luggage. Thank you, Biday. Hey, Borgy, why are you soaked? You're always running all over the place. Irene, why did you bring so many swimsuits? Nanny Santa, prepare the scissors. So, are we sure we're heading back home? For the time-being. Maybe two to three days. Till all the commotion dies down. The kids, Irene. Dear. Their things are ready, mommy. They're just waiting for us outside. Let's get moving. Biday, please. How are you feeling? Tommy and I have already notified everyone who's coming with us. Our escorts, the porters, and our drivers. So don't worry. We'll be out of this mess in no time. We just need to say goodbye to everyone with us here in the palace. You better make sure they are safe, too. Oh, Ime. The true revolution fights for what is right and just. You must know when to do what you must. And when to do the right thing at the right time. All who have been faithful to me, to our nation, and to your duty, You always say that it is an honor to serve me, my family, but there is no honor greater than that which I have achieved when I was tasked to serve you. I am Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos, a politician, a lawyer, a soldier, and president of the Philippines. I thank you all. Thank you so much for filling in for our shortcomings, for forgiving our excesses. To all of you, it is because of you that my entire family experienced a comfortable and peaceful home. I love you all. You are very dear to me. If every attempt to oust the Marcos family have been carefully planned, it took them only a few hours to come up with the strategy to ensure the safety of the people who remained loyal to them till the very end of their term. Chapter Ten: Ripped Fabric Listen up, everyone. They say there are about a thousand people outside the Malacañang complex versus only about fifty of you who are left here. In a few minutes, they can break the gate, and cross the barricade. My family will not be able to forgive ourselves if something bad happens to you. As the eldest, I'm asking for your forgiveness for the danger and sacrifice you are facing because of us. And as a last request, as your ma'am Imee's last command, I beg and implore you, to follow what I'm going to say next. Cut and tear my mother's gown until you get enough fabric for everyone. Because you are no longer in uniform, they won't recognize that you are from the palace. They will not hurt you. When they see you and catch you in here, this piece of fabric will save your life. And to convince them, raise your hand and flash this sign. There is nothing else you can do. We can't take all of you with us! All right, do that. Miss Lucy! Nanny Santa! Ma'am. Do it now! Go ahead! Jesus, just do it! Biday! What? Do it! You need to get home to your family safely! On behalf of our family, my mother, and my father, though we cannot return your kindness, I promise you, the day will come that we will clear our names together. I thank you deeply. May the Lord God guide us. If you've ever wanted to know what a revolution looks like, feast your eyes on Manila tonight. Does everyone have a fabric? Adjust your head bands. Wrap the others around your arm. We can't all look the same. The gown! Don't forget about the gown! Hide the gown! Santa. Santa. you're the only one with the keys, right? Go hide. Both of you hide. Biday. Miss Lucy. Take care of yourselves. Be careful. Thousands converge on the presidential palace. There were some ugly scenes en route as Marcos loyalists clash with Aquino supporters. The two sides throwing rocks and bottles. Imee. Miss Lucy. You can't come with us. Please stay behind. Imee, I'm not your maid anymore. I'm not obliged to obey your orders. Didn't you tell us to go back to our families? You are my family! Come on, Borgy. Why are there so many of you in here? How did you get in ahead of us? You must be for the Marcoses! Yeah, I think they're with the Marcoses. What do you mean? Look. Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! I said, Ferdinand. Now that you're president, what's my role? "Now that I'm president," he said. I'll build a strong house for the Filipino people. You'll make it a home. Then I reflected. What makes a home? Love. These were stolen from the Filipino people. - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! - Cory! Cory! Cory? Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Look, There, there! Hurry up, let's go there! Fuck you all! What more do you want? Leave us alone. Miss Imee, Madam, Mr. President. Our conscience couldn't bear not to see you before you leave. We just pretended to wear yellow, so we can get in and escort you to safety. Mr. President. Please watch yourself out there. We love you very much. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you very much. This way. Hello? Hello, they're on their way now. Is he dying? He is ill. He is terribly sick. Is he dying? No, I don't think so. He is sick, but not dying. Well, if he's not dying-- He wishes to go to Paoay. He wants to go to Ilocos. No. Take them all. Get them out of the Philippines. Excuse me? Get them out of the Philippines. What now? I can't seem to get ahead. That's because you keep standing. You're quite right. The one sitting gets all the luck. Lucy got to be with Marcoses all the way to Hawaii. She decided it was better to stay behind in the United States even though the Marcoses have returned home to the Philippines. Lucy died of old age in March 2022. She did not live long enough to see Bonget become president. After the attack on the Palace, Santa went home to Leyte, her vigor left her completely-- she rarely ate or spoke to anybody. Santa died of a broken heart just two weeks after the Marcoses left the country. Biday survived after jumping into the Pasig River. She never lost hope that the Marcoses would return to the country. And when they were back, she stayed by former First Lady Imelda's side to this day. Biday celebrated her 80th birthday last May 28, 2022 with Imelda Marcos. Biday remains healthy and full of life, and most of all, she now knows how to swim.
