Hello? I will call later what did you say Let it go, Farzaneh, I'm not bored What happened to me? I think you have placed the dice somewhere before you saw that I am going A simple ultrasound that does not require so many check-ups Do you want me to please you? Either sleep or tell me where you put the dice, let's play our game I am not worried about myself My child is fine Yes, I understand, Doctor Madam, knowing that you were chemically sensitive, why didn't you consult a doctor before pregnancy? ...my chemotherapy - they didn't have a problem - I remember that a week after the chemical treatment, all the effects such as swelling of the eyes and blisters disappeared they got better it's true? - Yes - There is currently no definite recovery for a person infected with mustard gas what does it mean? I am nothing Apparently yes But it may show itself in different ways with a cold or weakness Probably this time it affected your child My baby? what is my child - Wait a minute - Mr. Doctor, is my lady in trouble or the child? They say that baby - let me - DNA analysis shows that your child has hypoplasia and lung shrinkage And when he is born, he will probably have other problems What are these problems you say? We cannot tell you for sure According to these tests, your child will probably have an organ defect We shouldn't have had children The biggest concern is that in similar cases Unfortunately, the effects of chemical gases are transferred to the mother's fetus (the phone rings) Yes? Hello Farzana Hello what do I do? You have to decide yourself If God had mercy on Dr. Zovar, you would have had a child like him what were you doing? I? I had no right to kill him - I don't want to kill him - I just want to know your opinion, should I go for surgery or not? Get the thought out of your head With your condition, eighty percent of the time you may not regain consciousness after the operation Who said this? Doctors What do the doctors say? (The sound of a baby crying) (ring Ring) Hi hi - Thankful Go take a rest - does it work? - How much do you like? Dinner is ready I say, how to do istikhara? Let's see what we should do, right?

What are you thinking about? You didn't tell me everything, Sohail Farzaneh? ...he couldn't hold his tongue, woman! It is because of these nostrums that his family left him alone Don't blame others for the problem Well, maybe there is some wisdom in it Did God want you to be a chemist? My work is just starting in the ministry With this child, it is not known what disabilities he has I found a reliable specialist I... never spoke about your words... not even now By God, if there was even a percent chance of danger, I would not go under the burden I also put aside his money Come on, we haven't eaten on the same plate for a long time Come I waited for you for a long time, you did not come I should not starve for the sake of the child (ring Ring) I am Kavianpour - Ah - please - hello - (Woman moaning) Don't shout, don't shout, the patient is sitting in the corridor Mr. Kavianpour has come, what can I say? - !enough! enough - God bless you, I'm already dead - OK, close the door - come help - that's it, i'm tired - !No, no - !Don't shout - take her hands - no, no - Hold on tight, it's over now - sit baby, sit - ...it's over now, oh, it's over Help him put on his clothes Did you lose your head, doctor? - uh huh - Thank you let's go Sir, they are waiting in the car - come on - Hi hi - Hi hi - Sir, stay outside, lady, go and take off the back of your dress ...my wife I am four and a half months old I want to see if this child understands the pain now or not?
