Yes? Yes, I'm Mark Wilder Oh, you'll pick us up? Perfect, thank you. No, that's not necessary. Okay, yes, wonderful. Thank you. See you soon. Thanks. Bye. While most scientists consider it superstition, it's a part of everyday life according to the experiences of many people and researchers in certain areas: contact with the deceased and the existence of what are commonly called ghosts. My guest today is Professor Lang, who's spent more than thirty years working in this field in Freiburg, Germany. Professor Lang: what happens immediately after a person dies? First: how can we know anything about this at all? Research in this area began almost 140 years ago. The Society for Psychical Research in London has done a great deal of work on it. And there are many pieces to the puzzle that can provide answers. Let's begin with something that I'm particularly interested in. In one of your publications you write that individuals who die suddenly possibly don't realize that they're dead. As a result, they remain in their accustomed surroundings. Could this be the reason why certain places are called haunted? If these souls don't receive help leaving the intermediate world, their uncertainty can result in them haunting locations or even individuals. That's very unpleasant. Tell me something. Victor Timmaz once told me that spirits see someone who's just passed away as when they were young, as a 25 to 35 year old, even if they were 95 and old and wrinkled when they passed. That seems to be the case, according to accounts from people who had a near-death experience and saw deceased relatives on the other side. Apparently, you're seen as you looked in the best years of your life. ... which apparently happens with children. There's a report from Sweden about a man who was in a car accident with his family. Tragically, his seven-month-old baby was killed, and the man had a near-death experience ...before the paramedics were able to reanimate him. He was briefly together with his son on the other side, who appeared to be approximately ten years old. Hey?! What are you up to? Reading. Watching videos. I got you something! Flowers? You thought of the battery for the dustbuster? For me? No. For somebody we haven't met yet. I'm only nine month long... I couldn't resist. You know that our baby will have the best father in the world?! Wow! Who is he? An incredibly hot and talented screenwriter. Yes, yes... Probably that guy with the great sense of humor that you met at Rag Trader four years ago. Yes... that's him! Well... Do you two have some kind of relationship now? Believe it or not: we live together and I see him nearly every day. Wow! We even got married last year! Really? No? And for our wedding he gave me a ring that still takes my breath away: two carats! Wow! He must be crazy about you. And I love him more than I can say. For example, when I see him all sweaty after jogging, I just want to do him right away. Then maybe he should take a shower? He should... What are you doing? My chocolate? Just a second. Do you still want to take a trip to Europe? Are you kidding me? No. We'll never be able to take our trip to Europe. Why not? Just because you started your new job at the Medical Center two years ago? And last year I had to work on the new TV series and couldn't take a vacation this year? And because a baby will turn the life we've been living upside down next year? And because we'll have five more kids, have to raise them and spend all our time, energy and money? Don't worry about it. When the last one goes to college, our first kids will be supporting us and then we'll be able to take the kind of trip we've always wanted to. Sounds great. I wonder if all the guidebooks that we've will still be up to date... ...in three decades. But do you know what: it doesn't matter. I'm sure they have special editions for senior citizens, and we can just get them. By then we'll have chips implanted in our heads that'll guide us through our vacation and to all the tourist attractions. Or make us imagine we're on a amazing trip While we lie in a hospital bed and get fed through a tube. And they monitor our new hips and pacemakers and artificial organs. Better than cigarettes. Liv, I'm... I'm not really crazy about the idea of traveling through Europe without our six kids SOME DAY. We should make the trip without them NOW. What's in that envelope? Something you're going to like a lot. Something a future mommy will like? It's a rental agreement for a 1,500 sq ft. Apartment with 4 bedrooms and a big kitchen and an industrial-size washing machine, and it's here, in our quarter! Okay, then... it's the one thing I've been hoping for my whole life: a date with Leonardo di Cabrio?! I tried. But Leo told me that he's not interested in going out with supermodels right now. Too bad. It's the tickets for our four weeks in Europe. Don't... don't joke about that. I am not joking. We're leaving in twelve days! Mark, I'm not falling for this. You couldn't get away, because of your new season! And I don't have a single day of vacation time left this year. Liv! It's all been settled. And now look at what's in the envelope! Mark! I spoke with your boss. You can take four weeks of unpaid vacation. Tyler, Steve and Louise will take care of your shifts. Please stop. This isn't funny. It's all been worked out, even with my boss. And before you are too big for us to go, we're taking our trip!! You're crazy, right? No. I'm not. This is the perfect time to go: a tour through Europe in the pre-Christmas season, then we can spend Christmas in Florence and New Year's in Paris! No, no. We planned to spend Christmas with your parents, and the entire family will be there, right? And Chris and Jim invited us over for New Year's Eve and we said yes a long time ago. I'm supposed to go shopping with Rachel on her birthday. And we go to Wollman Rink with the Andersons every December 6... Dear God, let it be at least a gift certificate for some lousy wellness weekend in Ohio. Otherwise, I'll lose it. And I'm pregnant, remember... That wouldn't be good for the baby. I warned you! Oh my God!! I love you! Wait, let me see. When do we take off? And where do we land? OK. First, we fly from JFK to Paris. Europe! I can hardly believe it. If someone had told me three months ago that I'd see my great-grandparents' hometown before Christmas, while I'm pregnant I'd have said they're crazy. Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking. Welcome on board of Oceanic flight 86a From Paris to Weeze. Weather looks good and tailwind is on our side And we're expecting to land in the Lower Rhine area in Germany 5 or 10 minutes ahead of schedule. So sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of our short flight. What? We're going to have a girl! We're going to have a girl? Do you have some special source of information? I just feel that it'll be a girl. I'm totally certain. What's favorite name? Mason. That's a boy's name. I know. But I said it's going to be a girl. I don't want to discuss girl's names right now. Why not? Do you remember the Andersons? Rose was so freaked out by the names David suggested that he almost left her. I don't want that to happen. Yeah, I know. Her hormones were going crazy. We women are a little irrational after getting pregnant. Right? But... ...I have everything under control now, no? I'd better say yes. You don't think so? I wouldn't dare contradict you. Fine. Then tell me your favorite girl's name! Whatever you want: Giselle. Giselle? Giselle! You're not serious! You see? It's already starting! You always begin an argument with "You're not serious!" But Gisele?! Come on! There it is: a discussion. That's just what I didn't want. And that's why I won't say anything more. Yes, but... ...you started it. You can't just stop now. That wasn't my real choice. What do you mean? Gisele isn't my favorite. I just wanted to see your reaction. Oh, I see. Fine. You know what: I think Gisele's great. That's what we'll call our daughter. Please, let's drop this. We have plenty of time, and we'll end up with your favorite anyway. You're the mom. You're the boss. If it's a girl, I get to choose the name, and if it's a boy, we'll call him Mason. You suggested Mason, and I like Mason. Fine, that's what we'll do. But you have to tell me your pick. Yes. But you might not like it. That's a possibility. Frieda. Frieda? Yes?! Your great-grandmother's name, the one who emigrated from Germany? I think it's great. Really? Really. I like it a lot. It could've been my idea. It could've been my idea. I love you! I'm not surprised... Now I know why it won't be difficult to pick us out. There's not a lot happening here. Did you describe us? As two good-looking Americans. Shouldn't be difficult. Welcome to Europe! I'm happy... Are you Mr. and Ms. Wilder? Hi, yes. Oh, how nice. Welcome to Germany. Did you have a good flight? Yeah, it was fine. Thanks, Ms...? Oh, I'm sorry. Elisabeth Thun. I'm Ms Roth's daughter. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry you had to wait. It's really nice of you to pick us up. Yes, it's no problem at all. I live only 10 minutes from here and have to go to the house anyway to show you around. And... ...there's a car-rental company there that's much less expensive than the ones at the airport. You'll save a lot. Yeah, but it's still really nice of you to do that, thank you. You're welcome. And you can have the house for two nights as you booked. That's right. Is there a problem? No, no... My mother... She had to go to the hospital yesterday. She's not in very good shape. Ah, oh. Oh my gosh. Mark! Ms. Thun, if you have other things to deal with, we can spend the first few nights at a hotel. No, no, absolutely not. I talked to my sister, and it's no problem at all. Everything's been set up and paid for. So please get in, I'll drive you to the house. So we can get there before dark. Here we are. Welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay. We will. Looks amazing. This is the living room, which has a wonderful view of the lake. But as you can see, the lake's still dry after the hot summer. Oh, what a shame. It never happened before. Okay, let's continue. There's an old-fashioned telephone in the hallway that also works. If you use it, we charge one euro per minute, but just for foreign calls. This room has a sofa bed, so there's room for four, which you won't need. And this is... ...the children's bedroom. You won't need that either. Okay. This is the bathroom, which has a shower. And this is the kitchen. There's a combo washer dryer in here. You'll find everything you need in the cupboards. As arranged, we bought some basics and put them in the fridge. Great, thanks. You can go to the supermarket yourselves tomorrow morning, when you have your car. And this is the master bedroom. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call any time. I wrote my number on the message board. So, if you'll excuse me now, I have to go see my mother at the hospital. Yes, thanks so much for everything. Yes, Elisabeth, thanks. I'll be here at 9:30 to drive you to the car-rental company. But we can take a taxi if you give us the address. No, no, it's OK, I'll be glad to take you. Bye. See you. Bye. Thanks. Pooh. Poor woman. But what a cool house. Well done, husband. I'll put the bags in the bedroom. Hey, let's go to the lake before it gets dark. Yeah, definitely. Come on. Wait a second, let me charge my cell phone, the battery's almost dead. Okay, I'll go outside. Okay! I can't charge my phone. Why not? Their outlets are different, I didn't think about that. We have to buy an adapter tomorrow. What do you think about this: I bought two adapters before we left, they're in my bag. I'm impressed! But I did forget to turn off the alarm clock in our bedroom. It'll go off and play every morning between 7 to 7:15. Oh, really? We should go back immediately, right? It's an option. I'll think about it. Yeah. Mark? Yes? Thanks for all this! Liv? Yes? Where are you? In the living room. Where are you? Here in the kitchen. Okay. Why did you wipe Elisabeth's phone number off the board? I didn't wipe anything off the board. You didn't? What do you mean? Elisabeth's phone number, she wrote it on the board in the kitchen. She did? Yeah, she said that she did. Didn't you hear her? I don't know. Did you make coffee a little while ago? Why do you ask? You asked whether I wiped away Elisabeth's number and made coffee. I've been lying here on the couch the entire time! The coffeepot's on the stove, and it's still lukewarm. Okay, well, maybe someone was here this afternoon to clean up and they made coffee. And then forgot to rinse out the pot and the coffee cup, which is still full? And the bathroom isn't really clean. It looks like somebody bled into the sink. Not so good. Mark, it doesn't matter. This is a nice place, and we shouldn't make a big deal about an unwashed coffee cup or a dirty sink, should we? Hey, nobody's perfect. I'll clean it up. What's wrong? I don't know. I'm just a little out of it. Jetlag. What time is it, anyway? It's 6:15. That's 12:15 pm at home, right? Did you sleep on the plane? No. No, not really. Neither did I. That means we missed an entire night's sleep. Should we go to bed now? Let's wait a little while, then we'll get into the rhythm here quicker. Let's go to bed at 9, okay? Let's go in now. I'm cold. Should I turn on some music? If you want to. Doesn't it work? No. Maybe the radio won't connect to the internet. Then just forget about it. I don't mind a little quiet right now. Okay. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't even feel like having a glass of wine or reading. Wow, that's unusual. You have to keep me awake until 9 o'clock. Do something! Okay! I've been wondering if this house had been built when my great-grandparents lived here. According to the booking website, it was built in 1915. So, yes. Cool. Maybe they knew the owners and even visited here. I wonder if someone died here? It's possible. Then the house might be haunted. Like by a ghost who'll scare us a little tonight? Why are you so interested in ghost stories? What do you mean with... ..."interested in ghost stories"? Your interest in spiritual stuff. You always watch those videos. I bet you didn't think I noticed. My interest has some to do with great-grandma Frieda. Frieda? That's relevant... Do you wanna hear it? What? A ghost story about my great-grandma. Wow! Have you been saving this for our first night in your great-grandparents' hometown? Maybe. So do you wanna hear it or not? It's a true story. That's how most great stories start: Based on a true story! Go on then. Now I'm curious! My great-grandma was a medium. A medium? What's that? It's said that she could communicate with the dead. She had a group of people who held seances with her every Sunday for many years. That's when she supposedly talked to spirits. Uh-huh. My mother's certain that her grandma really had this gift. Don't look at me like that! After my great-grandfather died suddenly, some important papers were missing, birth certificates from Germany I think, and no one knew where he put them. Then my great-grandma contacted my great-grandpa one day. She spoke with your dead great-grandpa?! Maybe I do need a drink now. My dead great-grandpa told my living great-grandma that the papers were in a safety deposit box, and the key was stuck under his desk. My great-grandma looked, and my grandma and mom were with her. And the key was there. And it opened a safety deposit box. And that's how they found the papers. Ever since then my mom's convinced that there's a life after death. Now I'm not surprised that you watch these videos. You don't believe in it at all. I just can't imagine that it's true. When we die, it's like going to sleep, forever, but without dreams. Everything's gone. Lights out. I'm sure your great-grandma heard her husband mention where the key was. Then she forgot, and remembered it when she thought she was communicating with him. Yes, I know. I've thought about too. And maybe that's what happened. But maybe it's not. There's no way we can be sure. For me, there's a big difference between seeing my patients as just biological machines Or... and I know this sounds funny to you, but I can't think of any other way to put it- as spiritual beings. But Liv, if that were true, that we continue to exist in some form, just imagine that we exist forever? What do you do all the time? That doesn't make any sense. And that's the problem with the idea of eternal life. Maybe what we call time doesn't exist on the other side. What was it? Your great-grandpa? Your great-grandma? Both of them? Very funny. Seriously, what do you think it was? I don't know. Sounds like a mouse or a rat. Here in the floor? Do you think they can get into the house? No, I don't think that mice or rats can get into the house that easily. What if they can get into our bed. There is something there. I hate rats! The house has doors facing the lake, and I'm sure there's a basement. It's possible that some animals are crawling around in it, maybe not mices or rats, it could be a vole. I'll take a look and find out. That's great. That's what you're here for. To protect me from wild animals. Than I'll do my duty and take a look. Liv? Liv? Hello? Can you hear me? Are you trying to play a joke on me? What do you mean? Why are you acting like you can't see me? I didn't see you. Where were you? Right here?! But not a few seconds ago?! Yes I was. I thought you were making some kind of bad joke. I didn't see you. It must be jet lag. Did you find anything out about our housemates? There is a cavity under the living room floor. I'm sure there is some mice in there, but I didn't see any. If you can't see me when I'm standing right in front of you, the basement's probably full of rodents. I just hope they don't come up to visit us. Was Elisabeth's number there? Yes. So who wiped it away? That's what I already asked you. But I didn't do it. I didn't either. What was that? Someone is walking around up there. No, the attic is just creaking, this is an old house. That doesn't sound like a creaky attic. Mark? Mark? There's nothing in the rooms. But look, there seems to be an attic over them on both sides. But I don't know how to get to it. There's a small door outside on the gable. I saw it when we came in. Where? It's right above the kitchen door. No one could be in there, right? Is somebody up there? If there is: please be quiet, we want to get some sleep. This is getting crazy. Is this some kind of spook house and you didn't tell me about it? Wish it were... You do? Are you afraid? I'd rather you said you aren't, because I'm pretty scared. No, no, no. It's nothing. Let's take our phones into the bedroom and lock the door. Otherwise I won't be able to get any sleep. Did you move my phone? No! I put it here on the cabinet, along with the charger cord. I'm sure it's here somewhere. Come on, let's go to bed. I don't care what time it is, I'm dead tired. What do you mean, it's here somewhere? I'd like to know where my phone is. Let's look in the bedroom. What's wrong? My phone?! What about your phone?? It's not in any of my pockets. I must have lost it. Are you making fun of me? No, I'm not joking. It's really gone. Maybe it fell out when you were in the basement? That's possible. My phone isn't outside either. Did you really have to make a mess here? I didn't do that! Oh, you didn't? Sure... No, it wasn't me! Mark?! I turned the radio on a while ago, and it seems to have finally connected with the internet. Okay, then you can please turn it off? Sure... Mark? Mark?! Liv?? How did you get there? What do you mean? Why are you there and not here? Because I turned the radio off and came back here? No, you didn't! I didn't? No, you weren't there just a second ago. That's right, I was in the living room. Yes, but... you didn't come back. Of course I did, but you weren't here anymore. How is that possible? We would've run into each other, right? The house isn't that big. But I'm here now. That's obvious, isn't it? Can you tell me why our bags have been ransacked and things have been strewn around the bedroom? No!! And I didn't do anything to our baggage. I thought that you put some stuff in the wardrobe. No, I didn't go near the bags. And I wouldn't have left everything like that. That's your specialty, making a mess of everything. OK, so it was me who wiped off Elisabeth's number and messed up our luggage, right? No. It wasn't you. Of course not. No. That's strange, because it wasn't me either. So there is only one answer: it's all part of some kind of game. YOU booked this house, and now there are these weird noises, our phones disappear and our luggage is rummaged through. It's supposed to be like a haunted house, which is probably the way YOU arranged it. To be honest: I was thinking along the same lines. That you're putting this on as some kind of creep show. It wasn't a coincidence you told me that story about your great-grandpa and grandma. And now the number disappearing off the board. Oh, right. You can't fool me. It would be nice if you got the phones so that we can charge them. I'd like to call my parents and send a few texts telling people that we've arrived safely. I don't have the phones. This is getting old. Can we shut this game down? I'm dead tired and would like to charge our phones, send some texts home and then go to bed. You're really going all out with this. Mark!! to be honest: I'm tired, too. I'd like to get some sleep, and that's why I'm begging you, please get our phones and put everything back into the bags. I really don't have any more patience for this. Right! Okay, what are we waiting for? Is there going to be a ghost or a serial killer or something? Or are there hidden cameras? It's all hilarious, but it's getting old, and I'm starting to get pissed. Liv!! this is the truth: all this isn't my doing. I didn't hide our phones or mess up our luggage or make noises. This house isn't part of an amusement park, and I have no idea what's going on here. Maybe you can tell me?! It really wasn't you, was it? No! It wasn't me either... Someone else is here... What is it? Did you hear something? Mark? What is it? Who is that? I've no idea... Who are you? Do you understand me? Why is there a little girl in the house? What do yo want to do? We should probably call somebody. Yes, call Elisabeth. Good idea, but her number's been wiped off the board. Check the trip information! It's in the cloud. And I can't get to it without my phone. Then look for our phones in the children's bedroom. Do you really think that the little girl has our phones? Who else? I don't know. She's probably just totally scared. Then use the landline and call the police. Come on! What number should I dial? 911? I don't know. I'll try it. No... I'll check the guidebook. It's 110 for the police. Helio! Do you speak English? My name is Mark Wilder. Do you speak English? Hello, can you... Hello? Hello? He hung up. I don't think he could hear me. That's not possible. Let me try. Do you speak English? Hello, can you hear me? Hello? He hung up. They can't hear us. I'll call Jack!! Hello!? Jack? Oh, hi, it's me, Mark. Can you hear me? Hello?? Jack, can you hear me? Who is this? It's me, Mark! Can you hear me?? If you hear me, I can't hear anything. If it's you, Charlotte: Stop playing games! Jack?? Jack!! It's not working. No one can hear us. Fuck. This is so messed up. What now? I'll find out if the girl has our phones. Do you have our phones? Okay, you can't understand me. I'll just take a look around your room. They're not here. I'll go outside to the road. Someone'll drive by sooner or later. What do you mean? I'll go to the road and stop a car or find the nearest house. No, I don't want to stay here alone. Without a phone, without you. Liv: There's a little girl in the house, and we don't know who she is. We have to contact someone, and we can't just leave her here. I'll find someone to call the police and you stay here in the meantime. What should I do about the girl? She's in the bedroom. Leave her there, I'll be back soon. You're not serious, are you? Of course I'll leave her there. I'm going with you. OK. Liv, please. You have to stay here. We can't leave the girl alone. Just think: while we're getting the police, she goes outside and falls in the lake or something else happens. Then we'll have a real problem!! Where are our phones? Where's my watch? And where's my ring? My ring? Do you understand? This isn't funny!! If these souls don't receive help, Leaving the intermediate world, Their uncertainty can result on Haunting locations or even indivduals. ...was briefly together with his sun on the other side Who appeared to be approximately 10 years old... Isn't there anybody in this damn country? Come on!! Hey! Please stop!! Do you speak English? Yes, of course! Great! Can you call the police for me? Call the police? Are you serious? Do you have a cell phone? Then can you drive me to the police? I need help. You must be joking. No! My wife and I are staying at a house nearby. We're on vacation. And a little girl just showed up at the house. I need to talk to the police, and her parents. I understand. Get in. Thanks. Thank you so much. Do you know where they are? Yes, more or less. And I have the houses address. Why are you driving with the top down? Because I like it. Is the top broken? No, I just put it down. I prefer driving this way. Is it far to the police station? We aren't going there. We're going to check on your wife and the girl. No, please, I have to talk to the police! Listen, I'm sure that the girl's parents are really worried and somehow we have to tell them... This is the house, isn't it? Fine, then we'll check on them and then go to the police, OK? Liv? I'm back! Liv? Liv?? Where are you? Liv?? Aren't they here? I'm sure they went for help. Through that fog? Where to? Maybe someone picked them up! Picked them up?? Yes, picked them up. What do you mean? Well, maybe someone picked up your wife and the girl. Someone?? Who would've picked them up? What do you mean? I don't know. Can you please take me to the police now?! That might be difficult. But I'm sure that everything's OK. Otherwise, your wife would still be here. You think everything's OK? If everything were OK, my wife would be HERE and NOT GONE. And there wouldn't be a strange girl in the house. I don't think that there was a strange girl here. Do you think I'm lying?? Oh dear... I have to go... Hey, wait! You apparently know something. What's going on here? Liv??!! Olivia!!!!! Liv? Liv? Liv? Liv? Mark!? Where are you? Liv!! We're going to have a baby... I'm only nine weeks long... It'll be a part of you and a part of me... Having a baby will mean a big change in our lives, won't it? Oh my god... I love you! Mark?! Mark?? Did you really have to make a mess here? "Hermann and Gerlinde Roth, with daughter Gerda. July 18th, 1963." Hello? Can you hear me? Hello Mark! Of course I can. Now we can talk some more. Hello? Who are you? The woman who just gave you a ride in her car. Did you contact the police? No, that's not necessary. I can help you find your wife and the girl. Who are you? I'm Gerda Roth. You're the owners second daughter, Elisabeth is your sister, right!? Elisabeth isn't my sister, she's my daughter... Your daughter? Is that some kind of joke? What are you trying to do, anyway? Just say it: what do you want from us? Money? How much? Money? You think I want money? No, definitely not. But I can help you get out of this situation. If that were true, you would've gone to the police like I asked you to. Listen, I really want to help you. But you have to trust me. And I have to help you very carefully, so that you do not get shocked. Just tell me what you want. I don't want anything. Just tell me what you did right after arriving at the house. Why do you want to know? Hey!! Just tell me! The quicker you do, the sooner you'll see your wife. Tell me! Elisabeth showed us the house, which I am sure you know... There is two dead bodies in your rowboat. You have seen two dead bodies in the rowboat? Who is it? I don't know... You don't know? They are under a blanket, so I couldn't... Listen: if you want to see your wife again soon, Tell me precisely everything that happened and what you did, when you both arrived. Think of your wife! Elisabeth showed us everything, then we said goodbye and my wife and I walked to the dock. We sat down and talked. And? What happened then? There was a man... He was walking along the lake bed. He came over to us. We talked with him. Then Olivia and I went into the house... Wait. The man: Exactly what did he do? Think! I can't remember... It was somebody looking for company, I guess. Nothing more. When did he leave? You don't know? Is it important? It IS important!! Tell me... Let me think. I still have jet lag. I'm sure he left, but what else? For some reason I can't remember clearly. Your memories are like a dream, aren't they? What if everything that seems like an illusion really happened? And things that seems to happen are only like an illusion? What did the man do? Did you really see him leave? Mr. Wilder? Ms. Wilder? I can't charge my phone. Why not? Their outlets are different, I didn't think about that. We have to buy an adapter tomorrow. What do you think about this: I bought two adapters before we left, they're in my bag. I'm impressed! But I did forget to turn off the alarm clock in our bedroom. It'll go off and play every morning between 7 to 7:15. Oh, really? We should go back immediately, right? It's an option. I'll think about it. Yeah. Mark? Yes? Thanks for all this! What's he doing? Oh, I don't feel like talking to him. I'll take a shower... You'd like that. You're staying right here. Hallo? Ich komme zu Ihnen! Sorry, but we only speak English. Ah, okay! I said that I'm coming to you. Are you from England? Are you on vacation here? Yeah, we just arrived for a vacation. But we're Americans. Americans! Yes! Now that you mention it. I can hear it from your accent. Real Americans, great. I'm just going to have something to eat. Oh, no. That doesn't work for us right now. Like I said, we just arrived... It's really not a good time. Don't worry! I won't bother you for very long. I just want to have... ...a little snack. Having an empty stomach makes me a little sick. And when do we have Americans here, real Americans? This area was occupied by the British after the war. I'm familiar with England and spent some time there when I was younger. The English are a little strange about food. Fish and chips, disgusting. And the bars close early, most of them before midnight. Can you imagine that? You have to go to a restaurant if you want to have another drink. It's silly... Isn't it? Can you tell me something about America? You're so quiet. Are all Americans quiet? The English tend to be loud. No, we just don't want to bother you while you're eating. You're not allowed to drink alcohol on the street in America, right? And you have a problem with naked women on TV, isn't that a fact?! Even a nipple turns into a scandal. That's not normal. And what about the climate change? Americans don't think it's happening, do they?! But look at this lake. Almost dried out. It hasn't rained all summer. Climate change. They say... ...that Americans are prudes. Are you two prudes? Listen, we... Listen?? You want me to listen? To what? To the American point of view? No nipples on TV, you can only drink alcohol indoors, but everybody can have a gun to kill people in a school. Is this the American point of view? Is it? What's your name? Olivia. Olivia!? That's a beautiful name. My name's Walter, which isn't really pretty. Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee? Coffee?? Please! That would be nice. I haven't had any coffee for a long time. Let's get him coffee and then he'd leave... I didn't want to be impolite. I'm really interested in America. I apologize if I seemed a little abrupt. It wasn't my intention. So. Can I have some coffee? Of course... Black. And no sugar, please. By the way: You have a pretty ring. You've a very nice wife. We Germans have a lot to thank you Americans for. Yes? Liberation from the Nazis. And then the reconstruction and the CARE packages, which were a great help. I think that we were happy to do it. A lot of Americans have German roots. Most of us. Yes, I suppose that's true. And then we Germans mostly helped each other, right? Do you have German roots? No. What a shame... Hello? Ms. Thun? This is Olivia Wilder. Is there a problem? I just got to my sister's apartment, and we want to go see our mother in the hospital. Can I call back in a few minutes? No, that's OK. I'm sorry. We'll be fine. We can talk about it tomorrow. Really? Yes, of course. Thanks. And all the best for your mother. Thanks. See you tomorrow morning! Yes... Mark? Mark?? Mark?! Where are you?
