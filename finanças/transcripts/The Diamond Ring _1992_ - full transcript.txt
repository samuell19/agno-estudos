Stop! March ahead. "Don't cast an evil eye on my beloved, oh cloud." "Don't cast an evil eye." "Oh cloud, don't cast an evil eye on her." "My beloved is sleeping." "My beloved is sleeping." "Don't make noise. Talk softly." Give me the keys. - I don't have them. I know where it is. It's tied to the sari of the lady. Hey! Drag all the women of the house by their hair and bring them here. We can't do that. - What? How dare you argue with me? Why can't you do it? Everybody has short hair. Bob cut. I hope you know that I don't think twice before beheading someone. Tell me where the keys are or I'll kill you. Give me the spear. It won't help. Give me the stick. Get the crowbar. One.. How far have you proceeded? I'll soon succeed. You'll never. The money of the offering made to the Goddess is still pending. Why? I'm trying my best to collect the money. It's thirteen and half rupees. I want to offer silver leaves to the Goddess. Please make one for me. I'll give you the money before Ashtami (eight day of Durga puja). Wretched fellow. You managed thirteen rupees after such a long time. It's thirteen and half rupees. I'll slap you hard, you wretched fellow. How dare you act smart with me? You are a cheat. As if you are a honest man. You sell impure silver. I do the right thing. I'm an artist. - Me too. No one in this district has skills like me. I'll pick their pockets and they won't even find out. I know what you are worth. Why are you eager to form a dacoit gang? My skills aren't helping me these days. They keep the money in the pocket of their shirts. They don't keep anything in their pant pockets. Go and steal from the houses. That won't help. People don't have silver or copper utensils. They use glass utensils. Steal money. They don't keep cash. They keep cheque books at home. They have cash, jewelry and gold coins. I'm not sure if people have silver utensils. But, they've big brass glasses, copper utensils. You'll get everything. - Where? In the house of Ratan Banerjee. Don't speak nonsense. You are scared of their dog. - Dog? It won't take me long to hypnotize it. Then what are you scared of? Their loyal and strong servant Panchu.. ..he can kill people with his stick. Then he is more powerful than you. - Don't talk rubbish. How do you know about what the Banerjee family has? I saw it with my own eyes. Did you enter their house? They had called me. They want to make a gold nose ring for the Goddess. Have you made it? - Yes. I'll deliver it tomorrow. Oh no! The power cuts have become a regular occurrence.. ..before the festival. It's unbearable. It's difficult to work under these circumstances. Give me the lantern from the shelf. Be careful. Don't break it. Bring it carefully. I'll get it. Don't shout. Keep it. Is it made of gold? - Most of it is gold. What about the remaining portion? Gopi da, you've added impurities to the gold that.. ..you've used to make the jewelry of the Goddess? Gold is like human character. It has pure as well as impure substances in it. Both of them together makes it interesting. Master.. - Hmm.. ..it's late. 12:30? - 1:30. Take this. What's this? Dew drops fall at this time. But, you can't feel it. When will the drummers come tomorrow morning? They'll be late this year. - Why? The high tide is scheduled later in the day. What if the drummers have to go back tomorrow? This is why I don't like it when you stay awake till late. You stay awake worry unnecessarily. We'll complete 30 years of puja this year. If anything unpleasant happens then.. ..we'll lose the property, our grandeur, celebrations. Don't let unpleasant thoughts disturb you. As Pitru Paksh (fortnight dedicated to ancestors) ends the Banerjee family.. Yes. My second son is coming from America this year. I'm planning to go to America with him. What do you say? - Do as you please. I'll take you along. - I won't go. They also celebrate Durga puja grandly. Do they play the drums? Do kashful ( Kans grass) bloom there? I'll make a small hut beside the river and stay here. I won't go. Go to bed. On the dawn of autumn morning as the cymbals are heard.. ..the clouds spread across the vast sky of this earth. Nature announces the arrival of the Goddess on this earth. The steps of Anandamayi also called Mahamaya can be heard tinkling. She brings along with her a new beauty on this earth. The beautiful green earth welcomes the Mother Goddess. "As the flute of Your light starts playing.." "..it fills the world with ecstasies." "As the flute of Your light starts playing.." "When I heard the music this morning I opened the doors of my mind." "It starts playing.. it starts playing.." Lakshmi, Saraswati comes with the better half of Lord Shiva Parvati. You are the generous, benevolent Goddess. She is the daughter of sage Kaktayan, Goddess Kaktayani. She is also called Kanyakumari. She is Durga the primordial energy. She is Sati, the devoted wife. She takes on a fiery form to vanquish evil. Her complexion becomes fiery, her eyes emit fire. On this dawn, Goddess we devotedly welcome your presence. Let flowers bloom everywhere. The powerful light, Mother Durga.. ..may your presence fill the earth with life. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, Mother. "Wake up.." "Wake up." "Wake up Durga." "Wake up Mother who carries ten weapons in your ten hands." "Wake up Mother who instills courage in everybody and is incomparable." "Wake up.." "Wake up." "You are the boon-provider, ageless and incomparable." "You are the boon-provider, ageless and incomparable." "The bearer of several powers, controller of cardinal passions." Devi Durga was given weapons by gods to fulfill her purpose. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. The Goddess decked up in her fierce form. Himachal gave her a lion, her carrier. Vishnu gave her chakra (discuss). Lord Shiva gave his trident. Lord Yama gave her kaldand. Kaal (time) gave her shining sword and armor. Chandra dev gave her beauty. The sun gave her bows and arrows. Vishwakarma gave her Farsa, weapons made of fresh flowers. Brahma gave her kamandalu (water pot). Kuber gifted her wealth. The gods decked up the Goddess with different weapons. They prayed to the Goddess to defeat Asura (evil). The three worlds resounded with the battle cry. Everyone prayed devotedly to the Goddess, their savior before her journey. "Salutations. Salutations.." Wake up. Wake up, son. Won't you listen to Mahalaya (hymns dedicated to the goddess)? It's almost over. I'll listen to the cassette. Your father is going to the city. Will you go there? Why is he going there? He'll call your uncle from the SDO's house. Go with him. You can talk to Tinni. No. She speaks only in English. Come on, wake up. Your grandfather will be angry. Why does grandpa get up so early in the morning? Uncle Panchu was saying that he didn't sleep last night. How did Panchu know? I think he also didn't sleep. That's very bad. - Why? Jimmy also can't sleep if anyone in the house is awake. Look at the way he is sleeping now. Wake up. Switch on the radio. I'll hear it from the bathroom. "If one bathes You, the virtuous with the golden waters of the ocean.." "..will he not experience the divine joy?" "..will he not experience the divine joy?" "If one bathes You, the virtuous with the golden waters of the ocean.." "..will he not experience the divine joy?" Chotka (youngest uncle). Father is going out. He is calling you. Won't you get the ornaments for the Goddess? You always bunk exercise. It won't help me. My biceps measure only 8 inch. It'll never become 15 if you don't work out. Is yours 15? - 16. Ok. I'll exercise. Ready. Can you say why Arjun was also called Sabyasachi? He could shoot arrows with both his hands. Why aren't you using your left hand? It's over for the day. My call has come. Mother told you to buy a conch shell. It'll be mentioned in the list. It's not for Durga puja. It's for her daily use. Have this. I'm supposed to observe a fast today without even drinking water? The rituals don't matter in case of medicine. Let me finish my prayers first. I'll ask you to give it to me. Has Bhupen come? - Yes. What about the drummers? It's not yet time for them to arrive. Anyone else? He won't come. If he comes? We'll do something if he comes. Why did the Goddess give it when She had t take it away. Bhupen da.. - Yes, tell me. What's the measurement of Mahisasur's bicep? - What? Why is Mahisasur green in color? Which colour would you prefer? Blue. Colour of Supreman. But, how can the Goddess kill Superman. Bupen da, what do I need to bring? The list is with master. Get everything mentioned in it. Don't forget the chandmala (moon shaped paper garland).. ..like you did last year. - Ok. Listen.. come back and help me. - Work Education? We need to decorate the courtyard. It's grandpa's order. Why did you take so long? How can I go without taking bath? I can't call from Mahitosh's place if we don't reach there within 10. Come on, hurry up. Let's go. - Ok. Once I witnessed the Puja celebrations in Kolkata. In your maternal uncle's house? They don't make clay idols at home like we do. The idols comes in lorries. That happens only in Kolkata. I've heard of Mother arriving in boat, horse. But Mother arriving in a lorry.. Is Mother bricks or wheat? How does the idol arrive on horse? The idol doesn't arrive on horse, Mother arrives on horse. What do you mean? According to scriptures Mother comes to earth.. ..on different modes of transport every year. Sometimes she comes riding a horse and sometimes an elephant. What is she arriving on this year? - On a boat. It is a good sign. Arriving on a boat signifies good harvest. Check it out. The harvest will be very good this year. Will mangoes grow on our tree? - Of course. There'll be wealth and prosperity in every household. Drums. Mother.. where are your scissors? You want my scissor again? Grandpa told me to decorate the courtyard. Today on Mahalaya (beginning of Devi paksha)? Let me start doing it from today. I won't be able to do anything when she comes. Who? Who is coming? - Tinni Banerjee from America. Tinni is a very nice girl. Not at all. She always speaks in English. Bhupen, has the jewelry for Mother arrived? - Grandpa! What are you doing? Panchu! Look, the drummers have arrived. Grandpa is in the courtyard but I haven't got the scissors yet. I couldn't go to take bath because of you. I have to make arrangements for the veneration Greetings. I've come from distant land. Where is Ratan Lal Banerjee's 'bati' (house)? 'Bati' (bowl). You mean copper bowl? Ratan Lal Banerjee's copper bowl? How will I know? Go and ask Gopi, the goldsmith. Your knowledge of language is very weak. I'm asking you the address of Ratan lal Banerjee's house. Can't you speak in Bengali? I think I'm talking in Bengali. I don't know whose ominous face I saw when I woke up. Go from here. Spare me. There is the person who can give you the information. Go and talk to him. Well, there's no time to spare and rest. Well, you are a busy man. I'll find his address. Thank you. Sir! Sir! Sir! Come on, shake hands with me. Shake hands? Of course. Please allow me to leave. You want to go to Ratan Banerjee's house. Right? Go straight. You'll find a Diospyros tree on the right. If you take left from there you'll reach Mr. Ratan Banerjee's house. You'll find them preparing for Durga puja. - Thank you. Be careful. They've a dog. I can't play it. Please guide me. - I will. You'll play during the arati (prayers) on Saptami evening. There'll be rock and roll performance on Saptami evening. Tinni is coming from America. Habul, what are you doing? Saw you cutting papers some time back. Now you are paying the drum. What about studies? I'll start after Lakshmi puja. Ask mother. - Ok. I'll finish my work and take you to the garden at the backyard. Why? - I'll teach you how to use the stick. When will you go? - Have patience. Stop hitting the drum. You haven't finished decorating the courtyard yet? The Goddess' jewelry hasn't arrived yet. - So what? I won't be able to do anything until Chotka arrives. I can't do it alone. I think someone is at the door. Does Ratan Lal Banerjee stay here? He is my grandpa. Are you his son's son or daughter's son? I'm his elder son's son. Who are you? - I'm Gandharva Kumar. You.. - I wish to meet your grandfather. Oh! Grandpa is praying right now. - I'll wait here. No. No. Come inside. I'll control Jimmy. You don't have to. Humans can be enemies but animals, birds and nature are my friends. Do you write poetry? Gopi da! What happened? Why are you panting? Was anyone chasing you? I'll be able to form my gang of dacoits now. Have you got a lottery? I don't know yet. A man from a distant land has come to our village. He has a diamond ring on his finger. If it's a real diamond ring then it won't be less than 100,000 rupees. What do I have to do? Just assure that it's real diamond. Come on, give me the ring I don't have it. I don't have it yet. It's with that man. You've started dreaming before you've achieved anything. It won't take me long to get that ring. You just have to tell me if it's worth the hard work. How do I see it? You are supposed to visit Ratan Banerjee's house. Right? - Yes. To give the nose ring of the goddess? - Yes. The man has gone there. What if I don't meet him? You will. The goddess will definitely be kind to us. Mother! Mother! Mother.. - Yes? ..a gentleman has come to meet grandpa. Tell him to sit. - Yes, I told him. From where is he coming? - I'm not sure. But I think he has come from a distant place. Tell someone to give him sweets and sherbet. Grandpa will meet him only after he offers prayers and has breakfast. I'll go. They've started playing the drums. Don't forget to offer him sherbet and sweets. You play really well, Gandharva Kumar da. Did you like it? - Yes. Please come inside. Mother has arranged snacks for you. Convey my thanks and regards to her. - Ok. Please come in. this way. - Ok. Gandharva Kuar da.. - I feel uneasy if you address me that way. Oh! Then what shall I address you as? Kumar babu? Address me as Genu da. - Ok. What's your name? - Habul. My good name is Kaustav Kanti Banerjee. - Nice name. Let's talk. - Oh! Have the snacks, I'll make arrangements of your relaxation. Your language is also weak just like the thief. Thief? I met him on the way. He was staring at my ring greedily. Is your ring expensive? - Of course. It belongs to our royal family. - Royal family. Are you a prince? That's why you speak in chaste Bengali. All this is rubbish. They don't have any value. Doesn't any of them match that one? He had a bigger stone. It wasn't dull like all these. It was shining bright. Describe the ring properly. Do something, Gopi da. Go and see the ring. Tell me about your intentions first. I'll see the ring and make a fake one. What next? After that you'll see how efficient Sashti Charan is. I'll replace the original ring with the fake one. What next? - What next? I'll break your limbs. What will be my share? You'll get everything. I don't want much. 8 horses, 6 guns, cartridges and advance to my gang members. I also need a crowbar. Are you aware of the expenses? Do something. Go to Agra. Take the crowbar with you. Steal Taj Mahal and sell it. You won't be satisfied with anything else. Gopi da, make a miniature Taj Mahal for me. Can you guess what is this? Lotus. Bird? Genu da.. ..how long will you stay here? I'll travel to my capital tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? Oh no! I thought that you'll be able to help me with the work education projects. I've very less time. There's conspiracy everywhere. The subjects are disturbed. It won't be right to stay away from my capital for a long time.. ..under the present circumstances. So much is going on? Where is your capital? Murshidabad? Don't ask me. It's confidential. Let me get back my throne and then I'll tell you. Chariot? - I can't send a chariot, I'll send horses instead. But, I can't ride the horse. My soldier will train you in horse riding. Do soldiers ride horses? Oh no! they've arrived. - Who? My cousin sister. She is a dangerous girl. She is over-smart. Can she ride the horse? Hi, aunt! You've made my clothes impure. She has just touched you. I'll kiss you. Tinni, open your shoes. You've had a haircut? Why? Don't I look good in it? - You look beautiful just like Tinni. Your complexion has tanned, sister. Habul. Habul's complexion has also tanned. Tinni, come and touch your elder brother's feet. The grown up boy sleeps with his mother. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seen. Eight. Nine. Ten. Brother, why ten hands? She is the Goddess with ten hands so she had ten hands. No. sometime she has eight and sometimes even 16. Eight hands? Is she an octopus? I read about it in Indian mythology books. You read about Goddess Durga in English? Mrs. Banerjee, where is your husband? He went to call his irresponsible brother who lives abroad and.. ..who didn't inform when he is coming. No! I sent a telegram. - No! we didn't get it. How will you get it? I peon knocked at the door and went back when.. ..he didn't get any answer. You sleep. When did you find me sleeping? Then how come you gained so much weight? Why are you pulling her leg? After all she is elder to you. Did you touch her feet? The Bongs have decided not to bow down before anyone. Boudi (sister-in-law), can you touch your feet.. ..without bending your knees? What will I get if I do it? Rice cooker. You won't have to strain the excess water. Sure? - Yes. Great! Come on place your hands on my head now. I've sought your blessings. - Shut up! I had no other option. Slip disc. I can't bend down. - Is it? Sanatan! You've come? I'm coming. - Hi Panchu da! How are you? Not good. I'm still a bachelor. You promised to bring a English bride for me. I've brought one for you. Where is she? - In my bag. Why are you taking me to that house, Gopi da? I'll tell them that you've mended your ways.. ..and are learning work from me. What do you mean? Was I bad? Everything is like that in the beginning. When you start earning money and name everyone respects you. Take the case of Ratan Banerjee. He led a poverty ridden life in the past. He lives in a palatial building now. He has cars. He orgabizes puja. How does he manage all this? Did Ratan Banerjee form a gang of robbers? Everybody is not like you. Then he must taken up the profession of a goldsmith. Sashti, you are crossing your limit. Genu da.. do you've coins? Mother needs it. Coins? Are coins easily available like bananas? The coins will be kept next to bananas in the prayer room. Dada (elder brother), Boma (aunt)is calling you. I thinks he is your cousin from abroad? - Yes. Tinni. I told you about her. - Yes. His name is Genu da. - Hi! Prince. Gandharva Kumar. - Prince? Really? I don't believe you. Take it. - It's only one. I asked for two. You asked for two? Ok. Keep this. Now there are two. - Wow! Great! You are like Houdini. Do you know Houdini. Chotka has come. - Oh! I'm going. See you. You know magic too? - I know many other things. Your mother is waiting for you. Her prayers won't get over if you don't give her the coins. You may leave now. - Oh "She eats mangoes and berries and hamburger." "She also eats sweet potatoes, paniphal and fried snacks." "She eats Indian fried snacks with mayonnaise." "She has fried frogs for breakfast." - Oh no! "Sweetwater fish and oblation.." "..Our Tinni loves them." Chotka.. did you bring chandmala and the conch shell? It's in the bag. Check it. Dada, give it to me. Will you be able to play it? Is Habul blowing the conch shell? It maybe Tinni. Can Tinni blow the conch shell? Why Tinni is also a Brahmin's daughter. "The thunder of the dark clouds resonates in the mountain peaks." "The forest is shrouded in darkness." "It rains hevaily." The deer couple couldn't hear the footsteps of the approaching hunter." "The tiger left behind his footprints on this path." This isn't Tinni. No. it's my wife. Let's go. We've to go to the prayer room when father finishes his prayers. Come on. Genu da.. grandpa has finished his prayers. I'll go and tell your name to him. Don't mention my name. Say that Ram Dulal's grandson is here. Son's son or daughter's son? - He knows the hint. Bisheswar Banerjee of sandilya gotra. Pratima Banerjee.. - Daughter-in-law, come. - Coming, father. Bireshwar Banerjee It's my turn before him, father. When did you come? - A little while ago. Me first. Grandpa, me first. Yes, darling. You first. Take this. You came without sending any information. I sent a telegram. I don't know why you didn't get it. Somshwar Banerjee of sandilya gotra. Daughter-in-law, how are you? How are you father? - As good as I can be at this age. Bireshwar Banerjee of sandilya gotra. Grandpa.. - Why are you always late, Habul? I was attending the guest. Who is this guest? - Genu da. Gandharva Kumar. What's this? You haven't finished praying yet. Gandharva Kumar. He said that he is a prince of some place. He said that there's a hint word which you'll understand. What's the hint word? Ram Dulal's grandson is here. Panchu, tell them to drop the fishing nets in the pond. Ram Dulal's grandson shouldn't be uncomfortable here. Habul, tell him to be seated. Grandpa will meet him after he eats something. I'll eat later. Habul, tell him to wait in the drawing room downstairs. I'll go there. What's wrong, uncle Panchu? - Nothing. Don't worry. Have a good time. What's wrong? Wait here. I'll go and check. Why is grandpa so upset? What did she say? Why is grandpa so upset? He met you after a long time, so he got emotional. Get up and help sister-in-law serve the guest. Let's go. What's wrong? - I'm not sure. Dada.. do you know anything? I'm also not aware of anything. Ram Dulal's grandson.. Ram Dulal? Grandpa.. ..here he is. Habul, I wish to talk to him alone. No one should disturb me. You play really bad. I'm trying my best. Is this your best? It's better than you. Bhupen da, who plays better? She or I? It's better when both of you aren't playing. Who was worst amongst the two of us? I didn't notice that. I was thinking about something else. What is it? Ram was proving to be difficult, now he has Sugreev for company. What do you mean? You have read Ramayana in English? Didn't you read about Sugreev? Please tell me. Open your shoes. Jimmy! Jimmy sit down. Is master at home? Grandpa is busy. He asked me to deliver something. Shall I call father ? Shall we wait for some time? - Ok. I hope he won't bite us. - No. Come inside. You've a guest at home today. Right? - Guest? - Yes. No.. my uncle has come from America. No. there is someone else. He asked me your address. He had a big ring on his finger. No.. he is a handsome man. - Oh! Fair.. - Genu da? Genu da? Is he your relative? No, he has come to meet grandpa. You are right. Where is he? He is talking to grandpa. Won't we get to meet him? - Grandpa? Well, we travelled a long distance to come here. I'll seek master's blessings and leave. - Oh! Have a seat. Okay. Inform us when your grandpa finishes talking. You'll know when he finishes talking. He is in that room. - Ok. This place is too sunny. Shall we go inside and sit? - Ok. Sister, where shall I keep this? Keep it there, I'll keep it inside later. Can Tinni eat with her hands? - Yes. Why not? Why didn't you take out the glass? - It's in the kitchen. Shall I bring it? Take the plates. The ground near the shelf is very slippery. This is the reason why you can touch your feet. What do you mean? You exercise a lot daily. The utensils are very heavy. What's the price of kansa, Gopi da? You told me that you won't touch anything you see here. I won't touch anything. I'm just asking. You are asking? Do you have any evidence except this ring? Yes, I have. They'll come tonight. Who? - Swet and Lohit. This is for Habul. Do they wear this while running? - No. No. This is worn before running. They open it while running. Take it. This is for you. What's this? - Hair dryer. I'll show you how to use it. That'll turn your hairs grey. Dada, this is for you. What's this? Hair dye? - No. Cologne. - Ok. This is for Panchu da. Shoes for uncle Panchu? He needs it. He wanders here and there. Last time I heard that he was bitten by a snake. Once he stepped on something. This is for Biru. There's a razor. It also has lipstick and nailpolish. What will Biru do with all that? - I'll take care of that. You couldn't do anything about it till date. I'll get Biru married this time. Show me the razor. It isn't working. Give it to me. You didn't switch it on. - Oh! Well, you've saved an expense. We won't have to call a barber on Biru's wedding. They've brought a lot of gifts. It's so late. I'm drenched in sweat. Check if they've brought expensive perfume. They've brought a machine that heats water. Shall I steal it ? Do you want to heat the water from the pond with it? Rascal! Make fun of me as much you wish to. You are at a position of advantage right now. I won't care for anyone once I get the ring. It's not a ring. It's a royal treasure. Is it pure gold, Chotka? - No. it's gold foil. Golden foil. You are so stupid, Tinni. If all these were made of gold then we wouldn't be living in this house. Then where would you've been? We would've been rich. We would travel the world. The pyramids of Egypt. The hanging garden of Babylon. Jungles of Africa. The desert of Sahara. Shame on you! What are you saying? How can you travel the world by selling the ornaments of deities? Will you go back tonight? Why do you want to know? They go back at night. - They are active at night. If I stay here.. will it be a problem if I stay here tonight? What are you saying? You are my guest. Where did you meet him, Sashti? Tell me where you met him. What are you up to? Are you sleeping? Where did you meet him? On the other side of the mountain. The gate is closed. How do we get in? - Chant the mantra. Which mantra. Let's offer flowers and leaves to the Goddess with sandalwood. No! Those mantras won't help. Open the door. Hey! Hey! Yes, he is the man. How are you, Mr. Sashti? You.. how did you recognize me? It's difficult to know a person. I only know your name. How? - Your name is tattooed on your arms. You are a good observer. Your vision seems to be shrouded. Perhaps because of your age. You can't see what you wish to see from that distance. Take a look. Wow! Beautiful! Is it American diamond? - It's real diamond. Goodbye. He is smarter than you. Come to the point. Did you see the ring? - Yes. I saw it. It's pure. Unadulterated. - Sanatan! What brings you here? What do you want? - Well.. I want to meet master. You can't meet him now. Come later. I brought the nose ring I made for the Goddess. Give it to me. I'll give it to master. Come in the evening. Hey you! I? - No. He. Master.. - Come in. Sit down. Did you talk to him? The ring is real. It belongs to Ram Dulal. What shall you do now? I'll talk to my sons. - Ok. Gupi, the goldsmith had come. Tell elder son to give him the payment. He'll come in the evening. I sent him back. Will you keep it or will I give it to elder daughter-in-law? Keep it with you. Why should I keep the nose ring meant for veneration? The puja may not take place. What are you saying, master? Is he is inch hurry? Can't he wait for ten days? He is Ram Dulal grandson. They don't wait. Strange! You haven't forgotten anything this time. I never forget anything. Last time I accidentally forgot to bring the chandmala. What about the banana leaves the year before? I didn't forget it. I kept it in the shop and decided to bring it later. You brought it only after father scolded you. Habul! Mother is calling you for lunch. Bring Tinni with you. Panchu da, listen to me. Won't Chotka come? The children will have lunch first. Bring that man too. Man? Oh Genu da. Who is Genu da? - Gandharva Kumar. Who is he? He has come to meet grandpa. You didn't meet him. Oh! Ram Dulal's grandson. Have your lunch. You've to cut papers. - It's done. Did you cut them? - No. Genu da did it. Gopi da, hurry up. - Don't ask me to hasten up. It's a high class work. No need to be so precise. We'll lament if we lose the target. We won't get to enjoy the goodies. Take it. See. Is it okay? You are a true artist. Will you be able to replace the real ring with the fake one? Why do you think I'm useless? I've been doing this job since I was seven. - Is it? Pancha said that no one could steal the duck eggs of Choudhury house. One day I stole them. - How? I replaced the egg with a similar looking stone. They didn't even find out. - When? I told you that I was seven years old at that time. Stupid! I mean which day of the week. At what time? Was it on Saturday? Was it a new moon night? How would I know? I didn't consult the almanac before stealing. That's why you never did well in life, Sashti. Do you know what's written in the scriptures? Anyone who goes out towards south to do something important.. ..on Saturday evening from his home.. ..is blessed by Goddess of Lakshmi (goddess of wealth).. ..with wealth and prosperity. Many years back on the full moon nights of the month of Kartik (Oct-Nov).. ..celebrations would go on for a week. People from far and wide would come here. The women of the house would sit here and watch 'ras' (theatre)? What's 'ras', dada? You mean gold rush? - No. That's a movie. It was a jatra (folk theatre). Was jatra performed here? It used to be in the past. It's den of pigeons now. The broken palanquin that you see there was used by the ladies.. ..of the family to travel to the Ganges for a bath. I've never been here before. Anyone hardly comes here. So what? We are children we can come. No one except grandpa came here. You mean the old men come here? - Yes, they do. Grandpa comes. Panchu da comes. Daily? - No. Sometimes. They come at strange time. Once I woke up from sleep as I was hungry. I was busy having biscuit and jam in the kitchen when.. ..I suddenly saw grandpa standing there. I looked at the clock. It was 2 am. On another occasion, it was winter, just before the exam.. ..i woke up early in the morning to study. Chotka had also not woken up. I suddenly spotted grandpa standing there alone amidst the fog. Kaustav. Have this. - Why? I know you are not allowed to climb trees. But, I don't think you are restricted from having fruits. Yes, I have. I just had lunch. Why should I've fruits now? Don't worry about the outcome. Do your duty. If you had broken the rod grandpa would've been angry. Try it. Dada! My 'tip' (target) isn't good. What's 'tip', dada? The one mother wears on her forehead? Genu da, what's the English word for 'tip'? I've travelled to different places like Venezuela.. ..Jerusalem, Honolulu. But, English is not widely used in those places. In easy language 'tip' means the efficiency to hit a target. Do you call this easy language? Where do we find milk that's sticky like gum of tree? You find it in fairytales. Come and stay with us. I'll treat you to it. People go to America for higher studies and job. It'll be the first time that someone will go there to drink milk. Your brother can't live without fish. I can't treat you to small variety of fish. But there are substitutes for rohu fish. Shall I give fish fry to father? Father, you didn't eat anything. What's wrong, father? Are you feeling unwell? Has that boy finished his lunch? The three of them had lunch together. Habul, Tinni and.. Panchu! Where are they at the moment? They've gone out. They must be somewhere around. Father, shall I give kheer (sweet)? Bhuban had come yesterday. The kheer was nice so I bought it. You all have it. - Yes, we will. You have it first. You didn't eat anything since morning. It's 3 pm now. You'll fall sick. Panchu, close the door. Meeting. You may faintly remember it. Biru wasn't even born at that time. Daughters-in-law are not supposed to know it. I started my life as a priest of the temple. The owner of the temple was Ram Dulal Sarkar. People would call him Raja (king) Ram Dulal. His critics would call him dacoit Ram Dulal. He owned lots of land. He was timber merchant. He also had this temple. Temple of Dasbhuja (goddess with ten hands). - Yes. Mother Dasbhuja. Do you remember it? - Yes. Ram Dulal was a widower. His son and daughter-in-law had expired. He had no one in his family except is grandson. Gandharva Kumar? He was three months old at that time. He was not even named at that time. "I'm Raju, I'm unaware of my family background." "I'm Raju, I'm unaware of my family background." "I stay where the river Ganges flow." "I'm Raju, I'm unaware of my family background." "I stay where the river Ganges flow." "I'm Raju." Genu da.. who named you? My father.. I mean my father's father. I never saw my father. I called my grandpa father. I heard that Arjun called Bhishma father when he was small. Did you hear the Mahalaya in the morning? I heard a small portion. I woke up late. Did you hear it? - I was on my way. - Way? I was riding on the boat to reach here. Did you hear it on the boat? No, I didn't I heard the shehnai. - Shehnai? A musical show was going on in a huge house next to the river. They were playing the shehnai to celebrate the puja. But shehnai is generally played during weddings. Didn't you hear shehnai played during the puja? When I woke up that morning I saw that the rain clouds had dispersed. The sun was shining brightly on the bamboo branches. On this holiday the shehnai of puja can be heard in the distance. Three Indian mynas fight on top of the roof over the kitchen. Beneath the idol of Dasbhuja in the temple.. ..I found a wooden box one day. What was inside it? - Gold coins. Lot of gold coins. I felt tempted at first. Then I realized that the person who had given me shelter.. ..the person in whose temple I found it.. ..should be given those coins. Your mother agreed with me. - But I didn't. How could he give away the blessings of the goddess to a dacoit? I didn't listen to Panchu. I did what my conscience told me. I don't regret it. Don't you feel bad Genu da? - What? You gave dada such a wonderful gift. You didn't give me anything. I'm making this one for you. Really? What's this? You'll soon find out. How long will it take - How long? It'll get done soon. Wait. - Shall I go and stand next to dada? Wow ducks! From where did the ducks come? From Siberia? - No. they came from our house. You mean they are pets? Call them. They won't come if I call them. They'll come if Panchu da calls them . Then call Panchu da. They'll come if I call them. Do you want to check? Oh! Look they are coming. Look at that. They are here. Where did you learn this? - Egypt. Where did I learn this? - Where? - In the country of Holland. Holland? - Yes. There are many windmills there. They gave me the idea. But, it's not moving. - It'll move. There's no wind right now, so it isn't moving. How do we get wind? You want wind? Let's run. The news of the secret treasure of Ram Dulal didn't remain a secret. It was the last night of Pitripaksha. Mahalaya. Dacoits attacked Ram Dulal's house. Ram Dulal brought the gold coins to me and said.. .. "Keep these gold coins with you." "I'll come back and take them." "If I can't come, my grandson will come." "Give him his property." But how will I recognize him? He showed the diamond ring on his fingers and said.. "He'll wear this." "He'll say that Ram Dulal's grandson is here." The dacoits were shouting loudly. Their burning torches turned the sky crimson. As Ram Dulal escaped through the backdoor.. ..he looked back and said, "My grandson will definitely come.. ..he'll come on the day of Mahalaya." Where are the gold coins? - They are with me. I spent few when I made this house. So, this house, the furniture legally belongs to him. If you don't give the boy anything? That's impossible. - No. No. He isn't suggesting that you deprive him . He wants to say that.. Ram Dulal had two guards.. Swet and Lohit. They come on every night of Mahalaya to find out.. ..if anyone had come. We never saw them. - Panchu knows about them. Their condition was that they would come at night.. ..utter the hint sentence, show the diamond ring.. ..and Swet and Lohit will identify him. We aren't bound return he property until Swet and Lohit identifies him. But, I'm bound. - Why are you bound? I'm bound to my conscience. To my religion. I know that Swet and Lohit will come at night. Well, how do you put it? No one except you knew about this. If.. You mean if I died? I'm not yet dead. I was not supposed to wait forever. Ram Dulal said that if no one came here within thirty years.. ..then the property would be mine. How long is it before thirty years? Thirty years gets over today. Are you tired? Do you ride the horse? Why do you ask this question? You are a prince. - Oh! I never rode a horse. You told me in the morning. It was someone else. A traveller from far. I'm your Genu da. Let's go. Let's go back. It's been long. Call Tinni. Tinni! Tinni! Come on, let's go home. I've decided to shift from here. What about Habul's school? There'll be a school wherever we shift. It'll be difficult to get admission in the middle of the year. I didn't call you to discuss Habul's problems. I had decided.. no I've decided that.. ..I'll ask two days time from him. What next? - What? We'll have to leave the house and go. What about the puja? It'll get stalled. Tell Bhupen and the drummers.. - I'll see to it. What's this? Why isn't there no lights near the oddses? Bhupen da.. - Bhupen da has gone. Why? Is he sick? Father told him to go. Who'll make the idol? - I'll tell you. Tinni, your mother is looking for you. Go to her. You go and rest in your room. - No. it's ok. You'll have to stay awake throughout the night. - Why? Will he make the idol? I'll tell you everything. Wait. Please go. What's wrong, Chotka? Mother.. when will the drummers leave? Tomorrow. When will we leave? - I don't know. Your father and Chotka will go in search of a house tomorrow Shall I serve dinner to Tinni? Shall I serve dinner to Tinni? Sister, do you've any medicine for headache? I'll check. Shall I get tea for you? I think I'll go and get shower. She is asleep. Won't she have dinner? Tinni, aunt is calling you. Go and have dinner. Tinni, don't be naughty. Go and have dinner. Don't scold her. I'll get milk for her. Who is singing? - Biru. No.. this isn't Biru's voice. I think it's Gandharva. "She takes Mother's name and cries." "Giri go and bring Gauri." "Uma is very sad." "Your son-in-law is a beggar." "My daughter Gauri lived a luxurious life." "Your son-in-law is a beggar." "My daughter Gauri lived a luxurious life." "All the belongings of Uma.." "All the belongings of Uma were sold by Bhola for drugs." "Giri go and bring Gauri." "Uma is very sad." "Bhola is addicted to bhang (drink made from cannabis)." "He has all the bhang from all the three worlds." "Bhola is addicted to bhang." "He has all the bhang from all the three worlds." "The seeds of Dhutra (devil's trumpet) and the powder of bhang.." "The seeds of Dhutra and the powder of bhang.." "..are smeared on Uma's body by Bhola." "Giri go and bring Gauri." "Uma is very sad." What will be the name of the episode? 'The theft of the ring'. - No. The terror. I'll attack Ratan Lal Banerjee's house, steal the ring.. ..sell it in the market and form the gang of robbers. The story will be different after you reach there. You'll go there, get caught and will be imprisoned. Well, the you can't fool the dog by going there in disguise. They can smell a person. I've news that he doesn't. The dog has become old. He dozes off in the evening. You never saw him that way. - No, I didn't. Gopi da, give me the mosquito spray that you have. What will you do with it? I'll spray it and he'll lie unconscious. Think again if you are ready to take this risk. Gopi da, you've read many books. What's the value of human life? My grandma used to say that human life is worth very les. And this ring.. the real one costs around 2,00,000 rupees. You won't get killed. You'll get caught and thrashed badly by Panchu. Did you hear of Putli Bai, the dacoit from Chambal? She didn't have a hand. Sashti Sardar will lose a leg. Right? Sashti Sardar? No. that's not a good name. Gopi da, think of a powerful name for me.. ..when I go to steal the ring. Why should you stay awake for them? I'll call you if they come. You sleep. 12:30 - They are never so late. They are waiting. They'll come when everybody is asleep. Haven't they gone to bed? The main door is closed. I've tied up Jimmy. If we shift.. it'll be difficult for Jimmy. Isn't it? How are you, Mr. Ratan? Why are you alone? Where is Lohit? - He didn't come. The condition was that both of you'll identify him together. Lohit will never come. He is dead. What's the proof? What's this? This is the death certificate of someone called Lal Chand Barai. That's Lohit's real name. I must investigate the matter. I'll keep the death certificate with me. Kumar will also stay here. Come and meet me after seven days. You were a priest Ratan Lal. Since when did you become a lawyer? Don't act smart. You are a religious man. Will dacoits like you decide what he should do? Panchu.. Call Kumar. And get the keys of the safe. Chotka. Chotka. Yes, tell me, I'm awake. They've come. Both of them? - No. One of them. Where? - Under the tree. Under the tree? Where is your Genu da? - He is over there. Let's go. Kumar, utter the hint sentence. There's nectar in the sunshine, nectar in the water, nectar in the wind. Let the darkness of the new moon night be erased. Let Kumar's coronation take place. I've carried a heavy burden since the past thirty years. You've relieved me from that burden. May the Goddess bless you. I've a request. - Yes, tell me. Give me two days' time. I'll leave this house day after tomorrow and go away. This was not mentioned in the terms and conditions. Many terms were not mentioned. For example you were not supposed to come alone. Panchu! Go and get the safe. I've a request. - Yes, tell me. Go away after the puja. The children will be very sad if you don't celebrate the puja. I told you that he is a nice person. Then why does he keep bad company? I can't keep this request of yours. If you want to celebrate the puja, there won't be any problem. The drummers have not left yet. I'll inform Bhupen tomorrow morning. All the other arrangements are in place. Will Habul and Tinni attend it? I won't stop them. Kumar, this is the nose ring of the Goddess. We had vowed that we would deck the Goddess with it during the veneration. This is your grandfather's property which he entrusted to me. Thank you. Chotka look, there are lots of gold coins. It'll take the entire night to count them. Take a bowl from the kitchen. It'll help you count them faster. Shall I smear some gum on the bowl. How will that help? The gold coin that'll stick on it will be enough.. ..to bear the expenses of the puja. Isn't it, Chotka? It'll help but think of Ali Baba's story. Do you like the people who cheat? Look at the room they've allotted you. The stairs are too steep. Is it too heavy? I'll slap you hard. Rogue! Why are you getting excited? Don't pretend. Why am I getting excited? Your use of chaste Bengali and request to stay back until the puja. What if he had agreed? So what? You've waited for a long time. It wouldn't have hurt if you waited for ten days. How would it have helped you? The children would've enjoyed. They shouldn't enjoy so much. They've exams when the school re-opens. Let them study. Where will they study? Under the tree? The house belongs to you now. Don't give lectures. I gave you ten rupees yesterday. Give me the details of your expenses. The boat ride cost me one rupee and four annas. - Ok. The rickshaw fare from station to the banks two and half rupees. Look at your tantrums. Why did you ride a rickshaw? Why didn't you walk? I started walking but I got blisters on my foot because of the shoes. Sticking plaster cost me 60 paise. One rupee four annas, two and half rupees adds upto.. ..three rupees seventy five paise. What else? - 60 paise. I got the shoes repaired. It cost me 50 paise. - 50 paise. Is he a dacoit? I forgot to ask him his name. That would've helped you to find out if he is your relative. 60 and 50 is 1 rupee 10. Ok. Why did you return one and half rupee. I bought a packet of cigarettes. If you've any problem then deduct it from my share. Share? - Yes. My remuneration. - Remuneration? I'm the one who toiled hard. I carried the heavy safe upstairs. What about my acting? That's not hard work. You came dressed in expensive clothes. Had good food and went out for walk in the evening. You've a good sense of humor. But, humor at this hour of the night isn't acceptable. We had decided that you would pay for.. ..my travel expenses to Bombay. I didn't agree to any terms and conditions. Where is Mr. Lohit? I hit him on the head with the stick. To hell with your terms and conditions. If I give you a share I won't be left with anything. I didn't come here to steal. I came here to steal that man's ring. Why did you wear this moustache? Do you think we can't recognize you? Fool! It becomes a problem if I come in disguise. What about that man? You heard everything. - Right! What shall I do now? Listen, go and inform your family members. I'll keep an eye on them. - Ok. Don't unleash the dog. Stop! Let me go, Panchu. Keep the gold coins here. The gold coins are mine. Ratan Lal has given them to me. He didn't give it to you. I won't stop the person to whom they were given. Don't try to challenge me, Panchu. You won't be alive. Let me check how strong you are. Who hit you? Who scolded you? That's why the child is angry and didn't eat yesterday. I'm speaking in Bengali. Isn't it Bengali? Look, I've real diamond. Come on tell me which one is real. This or that? Chotka has caught that man. Come quickly. Get a rope quickly. Here you go, sir. What else do you've in your bag? I've this too. Apply it on your wounds. I'll take that later. Take care of Panchu da. Hey! I know a herb which cans top blood loss. Wait. Have you started practicing medicine, Sashti Charan? Biru, bring Panchhu to my room. Bishu, call the doctor. From who did you take music lessons? I'm self-trained. Music, magic, call of ducks, I'm self-trained. - Egypt? Besides my village school was a huge pond. Lots of ducks would swim on it. I never paid attention to what the teachers taught.. ..during the afternoon classes. I would be busy hearing the quacking sound of ducks. The one day I realized that I could imitate their voice. - Ok. Well, I've travelled only till the city in my district. I've travelled the world only with the help of books. How would you travel to Bombay? You also stay in a different village. Didn't I manage to reach here? This is a small village. That's a huge city. It's not an easy task to become a film actor. Why? Didn't you like my acting? - Yes. Why did you take this huge risk. He promised to pay my travel expenses to Bombay.. ..and the expenses of few days stay there.. ..if I played the role of a prince and help him recover his lost property. You were about to ruin our lives for such a small sum of money? He told me everything. He described your house situated on a vast land, The temple of the goddess, the safe filled with gold coins. everything. He didn't mention the children Habul and Tinni to me. But, this experience has helped me. I got the chance to meet Habul and Tinni. Do you know the cost of the ring on your finger? I don't know the exact value. But, I know it's expensive. You could've sold it an gone to Bombay. You wouldn't have to take so much trouble. An actor never sells his accessories when the show is going on.. ..even if it's expensive. This was a part of my prince's get up. I had promised to return him the ring after the work gets done. You don't have to. Keep the ring with you. It's my order. I didn't wish to win a lottery. I wanted to earn with my acting skills. What shall you do? You take the decision. Sorry, father. I can't suggest anything in this regard. I'm still confused. I'll tell you whatever I heard from Lohit. Ram Dulal and his grandson are not alive. They took shelter in a deep forest after escaping from home. They were afflicted with a serious ailment.. ..after being bitten by some poisonous insect. They died after few days. Swet and Lohit had taken care of them before they died. So, before death Ram Dulal gave this diamond ring to them. Since that day they searched someone who could play the role.. ..of Ram Dulal's grandson. Finally they met me. I am actor. Since childhood I had a dream to go to Bombay.. ..and become a film actor. Why did you learn chaste Bengali instead of Hindi? This is also a part of my acting. I used some difficult words as I was playing the part of a prince. Great! You've everything in your bag. I've everything except money. Oh! Here is the papers of the house and the nose ring of the goddess. Now it's up to you to decide if you want me to get arrested. The Devipksha (the period when people surrender to Goddess) starts from today. I don't want anyone to go away from my house.. ..with unfulfilled wishes. Father.. we can leave him. I announced my decision. Do what you this is right. It's time for Panchu's medicine. I'll have to go now. Mr. Gandharva Kumar.. - My name is Dilip Kumar Biswas. Do something. Come with me. - Where? I'll make arrangements for your travel to Bombay. Brother-in-law, he must leave after having breakfast. Thank you sister-in-law. Excuse me, change your name after you got to Bombay. Which name? Dilip Kumar or Gandharva Kumar? Genu da, won't you come here again? Yes, I will On the day of Mahalaya. - Sure? Of course. I hope you won't forget your promise. No. I won't. I give this to you so that you don't forget me. Token? - That's not the fake one. That's the real diamond ring. I've the real one with me. Bye. Chotka, you? I was waiting for you. Let's go. Chotka, Swet was a muscular man. How did you manage to pin him down? He is a bad man. He was fighting because he was greedy. I was fighting in self-defense. I was fighting to save everybody. Oh! Just like Sabyasachi. I could because I exercise daily. From tomorrow. It's time to make offerings to the goddess. Take flowers. Salutations to the Supreme powerful Goddess. Salutations to the Supreme powerful Goddess. The goddess decked with garland of heads. The goddess decked with garland of heads. One who saves us from evil. One who saves us from evil. With a scepter in her hands. With a scepter in her hands. Let's offer flowers to you dipped in sandalwood.
