THESE ARE WONDERFUL PICTURES OF THE LEOPARDS. - YEAH, THIS IS THE MOTHER WE’VE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR 12 YEARS. - OH, THEY’RE GORGEOUS. - WANT SOME TEA? - TEA WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU. UM, STRONG, NO MILK, TWO SUGARS. - OKAY, WE’LL HAVE A TEA. - TAKE A SEAT. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. - THANK YOU. IT CERTAINLY IS SOME PLACE YOU’VE GOT HERE. IT’S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I’D IMAGINED. - SO DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TRIP? - WELL, IT’S BEEN QUITE AN EXPERIENCE. TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN I EXPECTED. YOU KNOW, I’VE SEEN MANY OF YOUR FILMS. THEY’RE REALLY GREAT. REALLY SPECIAL. - TEA FOR YOU. - THANK YOU. - PLEASURE. - THANK YOU. MM. SOME KIND OF HERBAL TEA, HUH? MR. VARTY--J.V.-- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP ME MAKE A FILM ABOUT AFRICA. I FIGURE, WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF AFRICA, YOU’D BE THE BEST PERSON TO HELP. DID YOU SEEOUT OF AFRICA? - MM-MM. - WELL, ANYWAY, I WANT OUR PROGRAM TO BE A BIT LIKE THAT. A ROMANCE WITH AFRICA, THE MYSTICAL CONTINENT. - YOU KNOW THEY’RE MAKING PRETTY PICTURES ABOUT THE ROMANCE OF AFRICA ALL THE TIME. I CAN’T HELP YOU WITH THAT. YOU WANT TO MAKE THE REAL ISSUES, THAT’S ANOTHER STORY. - [tsking] J.V. [speaking African language] - I DON’T KNOW WHAT-- WHAT’D HE SAY? - UH, HE SAYS, "HOW’S THE TEA?" - ALL THAT TO SAY THAT, HUH? IT’S GREAT. THANK YOU. LOOK, WHY DON’T YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCRIPT. I’M SURE YOU’LL HAVE SOME IDEAS-- [animal roaring] [both speaking African language] - COME ON. WE’VE GOT TO CHECK IT OUT. - YOU WANT ME TO COME? WANT ME TO COME? - YEAH, YEAH! LET’S GO! - ALL RIGHT. - TAKE THIS. WHITE’S TOO BRIGHT. - OKAY. - [speaking African language] [speaking African language] [animal roaring] - WHAT WAS THAT? - SOUNDS LIKE LEOPARDS FIGHTING. [speaking African language] - [speaking African language] - LET’S GO. [engine turns over] - [speaking African language] - YEAH. - IT’S THE MOTHER LEOPARD. [speaking African language] [leopard rumbling] [speaking African language] - CAN’T WE DO SOMETHING? - NAH. CAN’T INTERFERE. [roaring and snarling] - WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING? - THIS LEOPARD HERE HAS INVADED THE MOTHER’S TERRITORY. [speaking African language] SHE’S INJURED. - J.V. [speaking African language] [roaring and snarling] [speaking African language] - IT’S ONE OF THE WORST TERRITORIAL FIGHTS I’VE SEEN. - SHE GONNA BE OKAY? - YEAH, I THINK SO. I THINK SHE’S OKAY. [insects buzzing] - J.V. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE FILM. J.V, ARE YOU AWAKE? - THIS IS A DEN THAT SHE’S USED ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SHE’S LEFT. [speaks African language] - [speaking African language] - J.V. [speaking African language] - LION. WELL, THIS IS ABOUT AS BIG AS YOU’LL SEE IN AFRICA. - WOW. AMAZING. - THESE ARE THE TWO DOMINANT MALES OF THE AREA. - MAGNIFICENT. - J.V., J.V. [speaking African language] - HEY, LET’S GO FIND THE CUBS. [birds twittering] [Jeep rumbling] - [speaking African language] - THEY’RE ADORABLE. I HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE THIS BEAUTIFUL. HOW OLD ARE THEY? - I COUNT AROUND SIX WEEKS NOW. - WHERE’S THE MOTHER? - SHE’D BE OUT HUNTING. SHE LEAVES THEM FOR A DAY OR TWO. DEPENDS HOW SOON SHE CAN GET SOME FOOD. - AND THEY DON’T RUN AWAY? - NO. STAY HERE IN THE ROCKS. SEE THE ONE SLIGHTLY BIGGER? IT’S A LITTLE MALE. IT’S A BIT BOLDER AS WELL. WE CAN’T STAY HERE TOO LONG. I DON’T WANT THE MOTHER TO CATCH US HERE AT THE DEN. ANYWAY, I GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO SHOW YOU. [projector clatters and hums] WELL, THIS IS THE MOTHER THAT WE FOLLOWED FOR 12 YEARS. WHEN WE FIRST SAW HER, SHE WAS ELUSIVE, AGGRESSIVE, AND VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WILD LEOPARD. THEN GRADUALLY, SHE RELAXED, ALLOWING US INTO HER PRIVATE WORLD. SHE’S A VERY SUCCESSFUL MOTHER, AND HAS ALLOWED US TO FILM NO LESS THAN NINE OF HER LITTERS OF CUBS. NO OTHER HUMAN BEING HAS HAD SUCH A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A WILD LEOPARD BEFORE. WELL, THIS IS HER MOVING ONE OF THE FIFTH LITTER TO ANOTHER DEN, WHICH SHE DOES EVERY FEW DAYS TO LESSEN THE CHANCES OF LION AND HYENA FINDING AND KILLING THEM. WELL, HERE YOU SEE SARCOPTIC MANGE, WHICH LEOPARDS SOMETIMES CONTRACT. IT’S TINY PARASITE WHICH ATTACKS THE SKIN AND THE FUR AND MOST OFTEN RESULTS IN DEATH. ALL PREDATORS ARE COMPETING FOR FOOD AND SPACE AND WILL IMMEDIATELY KILL THE CUBS OF ANOTHER PREDATOR IF THEY FIND THEM. THIS IS THE SADDEST MOMENT WE EVER SHARED WITH HER. SHE ATTACKED THE LIONS, SAVED THE ONE CUB, BUT THE OTHER WAS KILLED. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. SHE ATE PARTS OF THE DEAD CUB AND THEN BURIED THE REST IN THE BRUSH. EVEN THOUGH WE’D BEEN PART OF EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE, IT WAS SEVEN YEARS BEFORE WE’RE ABLE TO FILM HER MATING. WE’VE REALLY SHARED HER LIFE IN MANY WAYS. WE’VE SLEPT OUT AT KILLS WITH HER. WE’VE WATCHED HER CUBS GROW UP AND HAVE CUBS OF THEIR OWN. AND FOR ALL OF US, IT’S BEEN A GREAT SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE, ALMOST LIKE A LOVE AFFAIR, JUST TO BE PART OF HER LIFE. - SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL I HAD EVER SEEN. I UNDERSTOOD WHY JOHN AND ELMON WERE SO DEDICATED TO HER. THE MORE I LEARNED ABOUT HER LIFE, THE CLEARER IT BECAME TO ME THAT IT WAS HER STORY THAT HAD TO BE TOLD. NOW IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF GETTING THE GREEN LIGHT FROM DAN. - HI, CHRISTINE. - HI, PAM. - HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? - IT WAS GREAT. DID ANYTHING COME IN FOR ME? - THIS JUST CAME. - OH, GREAT. HI. THANK YOU. HELLO, - HI. - OH. - I’M SO GLAD YOU’RE BACK. JACK IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. - THIS’LL SHUT HIM UP. - LET’S GO TO WORK. - OKAY. AND I WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THIS. - BLACK RHINO POPULATIONS OF AFRICA CONTINUALLY ON THE ROAD TO OBLIVION. [gunshot] A SPECIES WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 65 MILLION YEARS HAS, IN THE LAST DECADE, BEEN BROUGHT TO THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. MAN’S GREED AND POPULATIONS CONTINUE UNHARNESSED. - THIS IS SOME OF THE FOOTAGE THAT HE’S SHOT OVER THE YEARS. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIGHT, SOMETHING ENTERTAINING. WE PUT THIS ON, IT’S DEATH. IT’S DEPRESSING. NOBODY WANTS TO SEE IT. BESIDES, THEY CAN SEE IT ON THE 6:00 NEWS. WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING SPECIAL. - EXACTLY, JACK. AND THIS IS SPECIAL. VARTY LIVES IN A TREE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUSH. HE SPENDS HIS ENTIRE LIFE FILMING WILDLIFE. HE’S DEDICATED THE LAST 12 YEARS TO FOLLOWING A SINGLE FEMALE LEOPARD THROUGH EIGHT LITTERS OF CUBS. HE’S CAPTURED ON FILM SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR LEOPARD FOOTAGE EVER SHOT. TO TOP IT ALL OFF, SHE NOW HAS TWO NEW CUBS THAT I’VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING. THERE’S A GREAT STORY HERE. - NOT BAD, CHRIS. NOT BAD AT ALL. I WANT TO SEE A BUDGET AND A FULL PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. - [roars] - [speaks African language] - GET OUT OF THERE, GIRL. [snarling and roaring] GET OUT! GET OUT OF THERE! [whispering and muttering] WATCH OUT! WATCH OUT! FOLLOW, ELMON. [speaks African language] WATCH THESE TREES. KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING. SHE WENT LEFT, ELMON. WATCH OUT. WAIT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SHH. LISTEN. [snarling and roaring] I THINK THEY GOT HER, ELMON. [snarling] MUST TRY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO FIND HER. - OKAY. [purring] - [speaking African language] - YEAH. [both speaking African language] - OKAY. - OKAY. - OKAY. [speaking African language] [speaking African language] [birds twittering] [mewling] - FOR ME, SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE ULTIMATE SURVIVOR. FOR 12 YEARS, SHE HAD BEEN MY STRENGTH, MY INSPIRATION. PERHAPS I’D EVEN BELIEVED SHE WAS INVINCIBLE. THE LIONS HAD CORNERED HER MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, BUT THE YEARS HAD SUDDENLY TAKEN THEIR TOLL. SHE WAS NO LONGER AS AGILE, AND NATURE ALLOWS FOR NO WEAKNESS. FOR SO MANY YEARS, WE HAD SHARED HER TRIUMPHS, HER SORROWS. SHE WAS MY SOUL MATE, AND NOW SHE WAS DYING. - THE BUDGET. - UH-OH. - I KNOW. I’M TRYING TO BRING IT DOWN. - DAN, I HAD VALERIE DO SOME GROUNDWORK ON THIS VARTY CHARACTER. HE’S A BIT OF A LOOSE CANNON. NEVER REALLY BROUGHT ANYTHING IN ON TIME. PROBABLY DOESN’T KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD "BUDGET." - OH, COME ON, JACK. - CHRIS, DON’T GET ME WRONG. I’M ON YOUR SIDE. IT’S JUST I DON’T WANT TO HAVE TO COME IN AND CLEAN UP WHEN-- EXCUSE ME-- IF THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL. - WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, JACK? - CAN YOU DELIVER THIS TIME? - OKAY, JACK. WE GET THE POINT. AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE LAST PROJECT WAS NOT ENTIRELY CHRISTINE’S FAULT. BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF PROJECT WE REALLY NEED. IT’S DIFFERENT. - DIFFERENT. - IT’S HIGH-PROFILE. IT’S THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN PULL US BACK UP. - YES, SIR. - BUT IT’S UP TO YOU, CHRISTINE. I’M NOT GONNA BABYSIT YOU ON THIS PROJECT. YOU’VE BEEN OUT THERE. YOU KNOW THE TERRITORY. YOU KNOW THIS GUY VARTY. YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED. THIS PROJECT MEANS A LOT TO ME. I’M COUNTING ON YOU, KID. - UH, YES, MR. VARTY--WALKER. - ALL RIGHT. [both speaking African language] - WE’VE GOT TO FIND THOSE CUBS, ELMON. - [speaks African language] [cubs purring] [animal hooting] [lion snorting] [birds twittering] - AH, THEY’RE NOT HERE. - [speaks African language] - [speaks African language] - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. [speaking African language] - [speaking African language] - [chanting] - ELMON WENT TO ASK THE SPIRITS WHERE WE MIGHT FIND THE CUBS WHILE I PORED OVER MY MAPS WHICH PLOTTED HER TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES AND FAVORITE DEN SITES. [both chanting in African language] ELMON. - YEAH? - COME LOOK HERE. I THINK I’VE GOT IT. [speaking African language] ELMON. - YEAH? - [speaking African language] - OKAY. [both speaking African language] HEH. [speaking African language] [both speaking African language] - OKAY. - [speaking African language] - J.V.! - HEY, JIMMY. HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. - LONG TIME, NO SEE. YEAH, GOOD. GOOD, GOOD. - WHAT’S THAT FOR? - OH, I GOT SOME BABY LEOPARDS. - OH? - YEAH, LIONS KILLED THE MOTHER. - OH, POOR THINGS. - YEAH, A COUPLE OF WEEKS OLD. THEY’RE DOING WELL. - HUH. - YEAH, THIS IS GOOD STUFF, THEY TELL ME. AND YOU? PROBLEMS WITH THE POACHING? - OH, YOU KNOW ME. I’M STILL AS FAST. - AH, THAT’S GOOD. AND THE CAMP? WHERE’S THE CAMP NOW? - OH, FIVE MILES SOUTH FROM HERE. - UH-HUH. ON THE RIVER, EH? - YEAH, YOU KNOW ME. - OKAY. OKAY. [speaks African language] HELLO, IS THAT "GLOBAL EXPLORER?" [speaks African language] YEAH. IS CHRISTINE SHAYE THERE BY ANY CHANCE? - SHE’S NOT IN RIGHT NOW. CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE? - YEAH, TELL HER I HAVE FOUND THE CUBS. THAT’S LEOPARD CUBS. - CAN I GIVE HER A NUMBER SO SHE CAN CALL YOU BACK? - NO, UNFORTUNATELY, I’M AT LONDOLOZI IN A REMOTE PART OF SOUTH AFRICA. JUST TELL HER J.V. PHONED. AND SEE THAT SHE GETS THAT MESSAGE. - OH, MR. VARTY. OH, YEAH, SURE. I’LL TELL HER YOU CALLED. HAVE A NICE DAY. BYE. - WELL, I’M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO PUT IT. - WHY DON’T YOU JUST SAY IT, CHRIS? - UM, I JUST GOT WORD THAT THE MOTHER LEOPARD IS DEAD. - THAT’S FOR CHRISTINE. - I’M HEADED THAT WAY. [phone rings] - I’M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT HAPPENED, BUT I WAS THINKING THAT WE STILL HAVE A STRONG STORY IF WE CAN FIND HER CUBS. I’VE BEEN TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF J.V. TO SEE IF THEY’RE STILL ALIVE. - YOU KNOW, I REALLY STUCK MY NECK OUT ON THIS PROJECT. - I KNOW YOU HAVE, SIR. [knocking] - MY SCREENING’S AT 3:30. HOPE I’M NOT INTERRUPTING. - NO. COME IN, JACK. THE LEOPARD’S DEAD. - OH, NO. - AND I DON’T KNOW IF THIS COMPANY CAN SURVIVE ANOTHER FAILED PROJECT. - I REALIZE THAT, UM, BUT, WHAT THE MOTHER LEOPARD DOES IS, SHE MOVES HER CUBS FROM DEN TO DEN. I’M SURE IT’S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE J.V. FINDS THEM. - ALL DUE RESPECT, CHRISTINE, YOU’VE BEEN SURE OF A LOT OF THINGS IN THE PAST. - LOOK, JACK, WE ALREADY HAVE 12 YEARS OF LEOPARD FOOTAGE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH. - STOCK FOOTAGE FOR AN ENTIRE PROGRAM? YOU MUST BE KIDDING. CHRISTINE, ALL YOU HAVE TO OFFER IS ONE DEAD LEOPARD. ALL WE HAVE IS ONE DEAD PROJECT. - PLEASE, MR. WALKER, JUST GIVE ME A FEW WEEKS, AND I CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT. - YOU’VE GOT ONE WEEK, CHRIS. - THANK YOU. - LOOK WHAT I’VE GOT FOR YOU. - [speaks African language] - COME ON, PRETTY BOY. AH, SISTER. [speaking African language] LITTLE TOUGHY, EH? LITTLE TOUGHY. YEAH. DRINK IT. DON’T BITE THE BOTTLE. THAT’S MY BOY. THAT’S MY GIRLY GIRL. - [speaks African language] - I SHOULD’VE USED THIS. - [speaking African language] - [chuckles] - COME ON, YOU GUYS. - OKAY, LET’S GO FOR WALK. - COME ON. HAVE A WALK NOW. [whistles] COME ON, SISTER. LET’S WALK. - HELLO. IS THIS THE HAZYVIEW HOTEL? CAN YOU HELP ME, PLEASE? YEAH, I HAVE TO GET AHOLD OF J.V., OKAY? JOHN VARTY. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE HE IS? HAS HE LEFT ANY MESSAGES? OH, OKAY. LOOK, IF YOU DO SPEAK TO HIM, TELL HIM IT’S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I TALK TO HIM. NUH-HUH. OKAY, BYE. [sighs] - "SO I AM LEFT IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION "OF HAVING TO HAND-RAISE HER TWO ORPHAN CUBS "WITH THE INTENTION OF REINTRODUCING THEM INTO THE WILDS." [leopard mewling and chirping] HEY, COME ON. YOU’RE FUNNY, MAN. "I BELIEVE YOUR OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE "FOR ISSUING SUCH PERMITS, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION IN THIS REGARD." [engine rumbling] - MR. VARTY. - UP HERE. - VARTY. - MR. VAN HEERDEN. - YEAH. - HI. - WE RECEIVED YOUR LETTER. UNFORTUNATELY, WE’RE UNABLE TO PROCESS YOUR REQUEST. UNLESS YOU MAKE A FORMAL APPLICATION. - UGH. WHAT’S THE PROBLEM? TAKE A SEAT. - THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS. - LIKE, FROM WHO? - [chuckles] IT’S NOT OUR POLICY TO DIVULGE THAT INFORMATION. THIS ANIMAL SHOULD REALLY BE KEPT IN A CAGE. WHAT IF ONE WANDER OFF AND TAKES SOMEONE’S DOMESTIC CATTLE? - AH, COME ON. COME ON. YOU KNOW THERE’S A PROCLAIMED GAME RESERVE HERE. THERE’S NO STOCK FOR MILES. - OFF THE RECORD, I AGREE WITH YOU. BUT THE LAW IS QUITE CLEAR ON THE ISSUE OF HAND-RAISING OF WILD ANIMALS. THEY MUST BE KEPT SECURELY CONTAINED IN A CAGE OR ENCLOSURE, FAILING WHICH, THEY WILL BE DESTROYED. - SO UNDER YOUR RULES, THEY’RE GONNA END UP IN A FILTHY ZOO, PACING UP AND DOWN. WITH ME, THEY’VE GOT A CHANCE AT RUNNING FREE. - WE ARE ON THE SAME SIDE, MR. VARTY, BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED. PERHAPS I CAN-- [snarling] - GIVE IT HERE. GIVE ME THAT. COME ON, GIVE ME THE HAT. DON’T EAT MR. VAN HEERDEN’S HAT. HOLD ON. HEY. GIVE ME THAT. LITTLE BOY, GIVE ME THE HAT. - WHAT ABOUT RABIES? I’M AFRAID THIS WILL HAVE TO GO IN MY REPORT, MR. VARTY. - YOUR HAT. - MR. VARTY, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU MAKE A PLAN IN A HURRY. IT’S FOR THE BEST, YOU KNOW. HERE IS YOUR APPLICATIONS. THESE ANIMALS SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING WILD. - GREAT P.R. JOB YOU DID. [speaking African language] THAT’S A TORTOISE, SISTER. THAT’S A TORTOISE. COME ON. HEY, SISTER. SISTER. UGH. RAN OUT. - J.V. - YUP. - [speaks African language] - OH, COME ON. GET ANOTHER ROLL. - NO MORE FILM STOCK. - UGH. COME ON. LOOK AT THE SHOT WE’RE MISSING. GOT THE CAP? - NOT IN THE CAMERA. - HOW CAN WE WORK LIKE THIS? - WHY NOT PHONE THE STORE? - BEAUTIFUL SHOT. [speaks African language] - HI, CHRISTINE. J.V. HERE. I’M GETTING REALLY WORRIED BECAUSE THESE CUBS ARE GETTING BIG NOW, AND I CAN JUST FEEL THIS PROJECT STARTING TO SLIP AWAY. I GOT A FANTASTIC SEQUENCE. I’VE BEEN TAKING SOME FISH OUT OF THE--AAGH! YOU MONSTER! AH, THAT WAS A CUB. JUST BIT ME ON THE TOE. OKAY. ANYWAY, THEY CAUGHT THESE FISH IN A DRYING POOL, AND THEN I LOST-- THE CAMERA BROKE, AND I HAD TO SEND THAT IN FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT PLEASE, LET ME KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BECAUSE THIS IS A FANTASTIC PROJECT, AND WE’VE GOT TO GET GOING NOW. - AND HOW ABOUT A SWEET DEPOSIT? HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU, HUH? OH, YEAH. VERIFY-- - JACK. WILL YOU EXCUSE US, VALERIE? PAM SAID SHE GAVE YOU THE MESSAGE. - WHAT MESSAGE? - I JUST GOT THIS FAX. THE CUBS ARE ALREADY ON MEAT. J.V. FOUND THEM WEEKS AGO. - YOU GO TELL DAN THAT WHAT WE HAVE IS NO LONGER A DEAD PROJECT. SO LONG, JACK. [jet engine whining] [laughter] - I REMEMBER YOU. THANK YOU. - THANKS A LOT, LESTER. - OKAY, TAKE CARE, MISS CHRISTINE. - WHERE’S J.V.? - J.V.’S WENT TO HESIVI THIS MORNING. TRY SOME GET A PERMIT. - PERMIT FOR WHAT? - OH, FOR THE LEOPARDS. - [gasps] ARE THEY STILL BABIES? OH, GOD. CAN I GO UP TO ’EM? - YEAH. CAREFUL. THEY STILL GOT CLAWS, THOUGH. - OKAY. OH, GOD. SHE’S SO PRETTY. LOOK AT HER LITTLE FACE. OH, ELMON, IT’S SO GOOD TO BE BACK. - YEAH. - CAN I TOUCH HER? - OH, JUST BE CAREFUL OF THE CLAW DOES NOT HOOK YOU. - I’M HOOKED ALREADY. HEY, LITTLE GIRL. HEY, LITTLE GIRL. OH. [laughs] WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING UP THERE, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? OH, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? HUH? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? YOU WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER? HUH? OH, I GET IT. YOU’RE GONNA DRINK MY WATER. - OH, GOOD. - J.V., I’M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE MOTHER. - YEAH, THAT’S LIFE. - BUT I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU’VE BEEN GETTING. HEY, LITTLE MAN. - JUST MIND: IT’S NEGATIVE. - NEGATIVE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KEEPING THE NEGATIVE HERE? - EH, STORAGE AT THE LABS ARE SO EXPENSIVE. - WELL, I CAN SEE WE’VE GOT SOME SORTING OUT TO DO. HA--HEY, HEY, HEY! COME HERE! COME HERE! LEAVE THE FILM ALONE. - HEY, BRING BACK MY FILM. MONSTER. COME, LITTLE BOY. COME, GIRLY. YOU WANT TO WATCH OUR MOVIE STARS. AH, YOU SEE NOW. LOOK HOW-- THIS IS JUST PURE INSTINCT. HOW YOU HOIST THAT HARE STRAIGHT UP THE TREE. HE’S NEVER SEEN HIS MOTHER DO THAT. THIS IS A GREAT SHOT. THESE CATFISH WERE TRAPPED IN THIS MUDDY POOL. LOOK AT THAT. BEAUTIFUL. - SO ADORABLE! - AH, YOU SEE, THIS IS ALL TRAINING FOR LATER LIFE. - [chuckles] - THEY DON’T CALL THEM THE PERFECT PREDATOR FOR NOTHING, YOU KNOW? THESE GUYS CAN SURVIVE ON ANYTHING. LITTLE CUB, AND HE CATCHES HIS FISH, NO PROBLEM. CLAWS, TEETH, EVERYTHING WORKING. - [laughs] - HE’S GOT IT DOWN. - OH, THAT WAS SO... WHAT A WAKE-UP CALL.

HE WANTS HIS OWN CLOSE-UP. - HI, CHRISTINE. - HI, ELMON. I BRING MY SON, TIDI. - OH, GREAT. HI, TIDI. - HI. - GO SAY HI. GO SAY HI TO THEM. - HELLO, SISTER. WHERE’S YOUR BROTHER? COME, BROTHER.
