That's them. ISABEL ON THE STAIRS -Good evening, Mrs. Perez. -Buenas tardes. Yes, come in. Buenas tardes. Little Isabel, you've grown up so much! Oh, what beautiful flowers! Please, have a seat. -I'll just get a vase. Dieter? -Ok. Phillip! So, have a seat. Maybe here. The child here. You sit over there with Mom! Oh, the flowers! Have a seat. I hope... ...you like this. Something light. Rice in bouillon. Set the flowers to the side. Thank you. Enjoy your meal! Sopa con arroz. ¿Arroz? Enjoy! There's fricassee too. Have you had fricassee, Isabel? Si. Fricassee. Fricassee is the same word! Wow! -All done! -Ok, now you can recite your poem. We want to greet our guests and reach our hand out to them. We wish them only the best here in our beautiful land. We wish them all good things and want to always be friends. We will sing, dance and laugh, and enjoy being together. You did that very nicely, Sandra. She learned that in kindergarten. Would you like white wine or red? Vino tinto, por favor. Ah, red wine. -Oh man, ink! -Ink, oh! Ink! Ink! Ink! Philipp! So, may I? Help yourself. No, I'll do it. ¿Qual es el alimento principale en Chile? Papas In English: potatoes. Ah, the staple food in Chile is potatoes, Margot. Potatoes? Wow! Mom! Look what they're doing! Have you had fritters? They're grated potatoes... Dieter, look up 'fritters.' Potato fritters. They're like little pancakes and are fried. Potatoes... wait. Potatoes. Potato dumplings, flour, salad... Fritters? Dieter, draw one. Philipp, bring paper and a pencil. Philipp? Philipp! What's this? Philipp! What're you doing under the table? Come on out! Dieter, say something! ¡Isabel, pórtate bien cuando estamos de visitas! Isabel, you don't like it? But it tastes good, mom. Well then. ISABEL, SIX YEARS OLDER Isabel, the empanadas are done. Can you help me? Oh, the empanadas look so good! How are you? Did you bring letters from Chile? ¡Si! From your husband. And for me? I'm sorry. There's nothing for you. Won't you sing anymore? Tomorrow I will, definitely. ...69, 70, 71, 72... Hey, what're you doing there? I'm sitting here. Yeah, I can see that. And why are you sitting here? Just because. That's not an answer. No one sits on the stairs just because! You don't? I never sit on the stairs. Why doesn't your mother sing at our school? Why do you ask? Well, it would be nice. Remember when you first moved in? You were this little. And you were this big. And back then we were your sponsors. Aren't you anymore? Did you cancel that? I'm not really sure. Anyway, that day we ate rice and fricassee. Hello, Mrs. Perez. ¡Buenas! Hello. Excuse me. I should've met you at the door. -May I carry your guitar? -Please. This way, please. Is it true you studied with Violeta Parra? Si. -Unfortunately, I never heard her. -But I've never sung here. Today is the first time. -Hello. -Hello. Welcome, Comrade Perez. -May I offer you a coffee? -No, thank you. How long have you actually been here? -In the school? -No, no. In the GDR. Six years. Six years! By now you're practically one of us. So... Physics, physics, physics. Housework day, Writing, Polytech, Brendel. Substitute teachers, R.N., R.N. Oh, yes. Right. The program sequence. First, the group council's financial report, then the report about... ...the success of the recycling drive. Then a city council colleague will speak about the meaning of the socialist competition. So, I'd be interested to know: how do you see your role in today's events? It's my first time performing again. Stage fright. We all have it. If I may make a suggestion, not too timid. Be bold! Ok, I think it's time. As an experienced teacher you develop an ear for it. Ok, courage! Next, the mother of 5th grader Isabel Perez will play guitar and entertain us with her songs. See you tonight? This is Rosita Perez, a folk singer from Chile, who's happy to have found a new home in the GDR. I know you've had a good school day. It's nice that you still want to hear me sing. The first song I'll sing tells about our homeland, the high mountains, the wide sea, and the giant melon fields. One, two! One, two! Can your mother sing El Cóndor Pasa? All turn right! High-knee jog! Up high! High! Why's she stopping? Today is my first time singing here. And you're all tired. And... Mrs. Perez, wouldn't you at least sing Venceremos? Let's go! Someone's coming! ¿Pero qué hacen esos niños? Hi, Mrs. Perez. How are you? News from your husband? No. None. It'll come! Isabel, open the window! Mama, you sang beautifully. In Chile, thousands listened to me. How could I keep singing when everyone was so restless? Mama, lie down. I want to go home. Max, come on! Up! Keep your hands in. We're off! Dieter, are you done? Dieter? Dieter! Sandra! This can't be happening! I'm losing my mind and you all... I'll get it. -Bad mood here. -Again? Philipp? You can beat the mayonnaise. Did you take your shoes off? Why do I have to remind you? It'll all be dirty again tomorrow anyway. Can you for once not have the last word! I never know when you're done! Max, lick this. -He hit me! -Beat the mayonnaise instead. You have a mixer. It's not the first time you did the mayo. Exactly. I don't understand why you always bake for company. That's up to me! Why is every little thing too much for all of you? Why don't you ever make fricassee? -What made you think of fricassee? -I just did. Why do we have company so rarely? Grandpa can't come every week. And the Chileans are busy with themselves. Doing what? We could invite Isabel and Mrs. Perez again. They've settled in and don't need us anymore. You can't just drop being a sponsor when you want! What's going on with you today? Done. -Where are you going? -Someone has to sweep the stairs! Since when? Isabel? Isabel! Philipp! Philipp! What's going on with you? They've settled in and don't need us anymore. Philipp! Philipp! Isabel! Isabel! Isabel! Isabel! Quiero ir a mi casa. Plenty late, huh? Well, I twisted my ankle. Twisted ankle? Come on! Stop hobbling! Well? When will we meet her? -Who? -Your girlfriend. Kids your age have girlfriends. Me too. I mean, I had one... Back then... I think... Yeah. I've never seen these pictures. You couldn't have. Everything takes time. Yeah, but they're from last summer. Exactly. Look at Sandra! She always looks stupid. No! Not with your fingers! Oh, it's Mom with no head! Yeah, I was standing a little too low. It's all about the right point of view, huh? Dieter! Don't you think it's a bit late? Do you want something to drink? -I've never seen these. -You couldn't have. Everything takes time. They're from last summer. Exactly. I'm going back to bed. Mama? Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Something always happens with the mail. Do you want something to eat? Would you like milk? Would you like to listen to music? And if the letter was from your father? It was surely not from him. This waiting is making me sick. Something always happens to me. Like today at the supermarket. What happened? They didn't want to sell me cauliflower. I just wanted a cauliflower. The sales lady asked: Don't you understand German? And it was as if I really didn't understand German. Slow down, Watson! Come this way! Hello. Another week's gone by, you know? How's your husband? -Ah, there he is. -Where's grandpa? He wasn't on the train. Where's grandpa? Really! I waited until everyone left. -Where's grandpa? -You can see he didn't come! There's grandpa! -Where'd you come from? -I came on the early train. I walked to visit the city in peace. We could've driven you by car! I said, in peace. -Pay, then. Come! -Yeah, ok. -How much? -19.80 Let's go. -The rest is for you. -Thanks. Unbelievable! I can carry something too. -I don't want to disturb anyone. -Yeah, yeah, Mrs. Flickenscharf. -The elevator is here. -When do you leave? Max! What a thing to say! Come on. -Philipp! -What now? Thank you. The elevator could stand being a bit bigger. Will you come see my room? Yes. Watch out. -Very nice. -Who? -That woman was very nice. -Oh. They live upstairs from us. We're supposed to be their sponsors. We were, but luckily it isn't necessary anymore. You don't hear much good about that woman. And we have more to do too. Margot, that's going too far! Who talks such nonsense? Mrs. Flickenscharf says Mrs. Perez doesn't go to work sometimes. That old gossip! She should mind her own business. Can a person get a cup of coffee in this house? How's it going? There aren't any fish here! I've never caught anything in my whole life. Max! What's wrong, Maxi? I think you've got one. Yeah? It's gone again. Now, Dieter! Say, grandpa, were you ever abroad? I mean, for a longer time. What do you mean? Well, like as an immigrant or something. Yes, I was a prisoner of war. In France. And how was it there? France is a beautiful country. More beautiful than here? You can't compare. Home is home. And when you're away too long, you get homesick. And that can really get to you. I always felt I was missing something important. Father! Coffee! -Dieter! -We don't want any now! Coffee, that is. Tell me, what does your Mom have against Mrs. Perez? -I think they're too loud for her. -Oh, well! -You aren't so quiet either. -Of course not. -Wouldn't you know it! -Give it to me. The fish is gone and took the hook with him! Scoundrel! Now he'll spend his life with a hook in his mouth. Unless he lands in someone's cooking pot. -There. -Great! Faster! Faster! We're passing it! Faster! Faster! Man! No one, again! -Hello. -Hello. Sorry to disturb you, but we're collecting for Solidarity at our school. Come on in. Leave your shoes on! Come into the kitchen. We want to collect for Solidarity, not come into the kitchen. Of course, but I'll burn dinner. Oh. -Oh, that smells good. -Come on! It's tomaticán with corn. Do you want to try it? A Chilean specialty. Go on, have a seat. What'd she say— a Chilean specialty? -That's what she said. -What's her name? Mrs. Perez. -Uh-oh! What're we doing here? -Nothing. I don't know what to do. Yeah, it's best to do nothing. Clemens, it just occurred to me: we can't collect money for the Chileans from the Chileans. It doesn't work that way. Best if we scram. We can't. She'd surely be happy for our company. Oh, yeah. Help yourselves. Enjoy! You don't like it? No, it's great, but... Ok, give me your list. Everyone who donates should sign here. We won't take any money from you. Ouch! Why not? You can't contribute to yourself! How much do people give? Some give 2 marks, or sometimes 5. But nobody gives this much. -Would you like anything else? -No, we're not greedy for money. You can have more if you like it. -Oh, ok. I'll have more, then. -Me too. Thank you. -You dummy! -Dummy yourself! Open the door! Max, cut it out! We've got to get going! I'm not going to kindergarten! -Good morning! -Morning. Dad! Breakfast! I'm going to wash up first. Let me try. Max! Max, if you don't open right away... -then... -Then, what? -I don't know. -Great parenting! Max, open up! Only grandpa's allowed! Don't do that again! Philipp, grab a cup. Me? It's Sandra's turn. -It's always my turn! -We've got to go! You know where everything is. Have a great day! -See you later, grandpa! -See you later! Hopefully not too soon. -Good morning. -Hello. I'm sorry to bother you so early. This is very embarrassing. I cut myself. I can't find anything in the apartment. I rang next door, but it seems there's only a cow at home. Yes, I know. Please come in. I must be making a terrible impression. Better than in jogging pants. Like most people today you know? You're lucky you caught me. I'm just leaving for work. I don't normally go visiting in my bathrobe. You'll be right as rain by the wedding! You have such sayings, too? -Come for a real visit next time. -Unfortunately, I leave tomorrow. After 3 days a visit stinks like fish. -Do you know that saying, too? -Yes. Would you like to come to our fiesta? It's an event here in this neighborhood. Yes, thank you for the invitation. I'm afraid I'll make you late. I'll just say I had to save a handsome older man's life. See you later. FREE GERMAN YOUTH CLUB Please. Where'd you hear about it? It wasn't in the newspaper. Mrs. Perez invited me. My name is Hammer. Hi, I'm glad you came. -This is Mrs. Perez. -Hello. Please. Where people sing... ...is a good place to live. Bad people don't have music. Wouldn't that be nice? Here! For me? For you. Why? Why not? I'm just not used to it anymore. A bon voyage bouquet, of sorts. I'm leaving. -Who's the other one for? -Ah... It's for Mrs. Perez. I visited her yesterday. Thanks for the cassette. You already gave me the record but that's ok. Well, it all sounds the same. Maybe you can exchange it. Before you run off, take these flowers to Mrs. Perez. Oh, grandpa! She'll know why. Philipp! Gently! -Hi, Isabel. -Hi, Philipp. Are they for me? Nah, they're for your mother from my grandpa. Oh, my mother isn't here. She's at a reunión. What's that? Oh, it's a meeting. Ah. But would you like to come in anyway? Sure, if you want. Give me the flowers. We can sit in the living room. Ok, if you want. Different from back then, huh? Yes, it's been a long time since I was here. -Should I put the flowers in water? -If you want to. Go on in. -Would you like some tea? -No, thanks. I had enough today. My mother will be really pleased. -Sit down. -Nah, I have to go soon. But if you want, I can stay a bit. Put the flowers on the table. -Like this? -Yeah, leave it like that. Sit down. Nice landscape! I think so too. Where is it? At my grandma's house. She lived in the Andes Mountains. It was beautiful there. My whole family gathered there. That was a lot of people! Only grandpa Otto visits us. Why doesn't your grandma come visit you? She can't. Grandma doesn't have money. -That's too bad. -Yes. -Do you want to see my guitar? -Yeah. -It's very small. -It's a kid's guitar. I see. Why are there two small guitars on it? Just because. Can you sing as beautifully as your mother? A little. -Should I? -Yes. Beautiful song. But I didn't understand any of it. Of course not. It's in Spanish! But it's about a white horse. It finds a boy. And the boy lives in a foreign land. He really wants to go back to his homeland. And he tells the horse: Take me home! Philipp? Good you're here. You can give me your things. Ok, then I'll take a shower too. But hurry. We're eating soon. Ok. -Where were you this whole time? -You know exactly where I was. Philipp. It didn't take you two hours to deliver flowers. Anyway, look how you're talking to your mother. It's true. What did Mrs. Perez say about your staying so long? She wasn't even there. You were alone with the girl the whole time? Yeah, so? Philipp, I don't think this is good for you. Apparently, she hangs around on the stairs with boys for hours. Not true! 1. She mostly sits alone. 2. Sometimes with one boy. And 3. That boy is me! Philipp! Dieter, come here! He won't let me wash his back anymore. Back? What're we really talking about? You guys, for example. Can you explain? There's no point. Why not? You want everyone to be a certain way. -This can't be! -Let him speak, Margot! I believe you think the Chileans should be grateful. If they celebrate a little loudly, you get worked up. But what's behind it all? You just make your Soli-donation and that's it! Isabel. Are you dreaming? You look so different. One day he'll come. The man with the black cap. He'll bring the news... that my father is dead. If I sit here, maybe I can stop him. And if your father is still alive? My Dad... We've already been waiting six years for news. Six years. Max wasn't even born yet. I know. You didn't notice how long we've been here. You had longer hair back then. We played under the table, too. You remember that? I remember a lot. Even the airport in Santiago. When we had to flee. Where are we going? Across the ocean. Is it far? -Very far. -Is father coming too? Certainly. He'll come later. -Isabel, what's wrong? -Nothing. You know, we had no bags. Mama couldn't carry anything yet. The fascists smashed her hands. Maybe he'll still come. I'm taking the boat out. Want to come? Yes. Dieter, I didn't want to butt in. But I have to say I don't think it's right that as neighbors you have no contact with each other. I mean, that woman has really earned having people be a bit friendlier to her. What do you say? What can I do? The very name 'Perez' is a red flag for my wife. I don't understand that. But... maybe she's jealous. Jealous? Margot? Well, maybe. Let's have another. Yeah, it's no good standing on one leg. Before a trip it's always good to sit together. -If you'd stay a week. -I can't help you both. You're old enough. But this woman upstairs... I'm really asking you: please take care of her. I don't think she's doing well. -Should we go back? -It'll pass soon. But if you want we can seek cover. See? It already stopped. We got lucky with the bridge. -Want to go up? -Come on. Look! It's like at home with my grandma! The boys always built huts during the corn harvest. They'd make flutes from the corn cobs. Evenings, everyone sat by the fire and ate roasted corn. It didn't rain here at all. -How tall it is! -Really nice! -You think it's good to eat yet? -It tastes best when it's green. Come on. Wait, take this one. It's so beautiful. Shall we build a hut? -Yes! -Come! -What're you looking at? -It's like a jungle. A light green jungle. I'm a panther! You're Tarzan! The friend of all animals. Look at this beetle. Look at the pretty flowers. It's just a weed. But it's pretty, Felipe. -Say it again. -What? Say Felipe. Felipe. Felipito. -It's really hot here. -Yeah. I'd like to learn Spanish. Such a tragedy. Isabel. Your mother... A letter came. News. You can't go into your apartment. Come to our place. Don't be sad. She'll be better soon.
