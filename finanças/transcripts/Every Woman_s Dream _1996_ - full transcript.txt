Meet Mitchell Parker. This is his story. It's a true story. And if it weren't for the fact that it actually happened, you probably wouldn't believe it. [up-tempo music] Mitch grew up an ordinary kid, from an ordinary family in the ordinary town of Sardis, Ohio. Which was unfortunate because this kid wanted nothing to do with ordinary. So, he developed his imagination. Now all kids had a fantasy. But by the time Mitch got to college, his parents from Sardis, Ohio had become royalty, who escaped with their lives from Bulgaria or Romania or some place. Mitch was perfecting the art of the lie. He was an artist. So where does a fellow with a God-given talent for stretching the truth go to find gainful employment? In Washington, Mitch became a lowly researcher for an influential congressman. But he never missed an opportunity to have his picture taken. He was building his wall of fame. But more on that later. Hollywood, the land of make believe called to Mitch. and with nothing but a few thousand dollars and a box of photos under his arm, he burst on to the California political scene as a lobbyist, in the fall of 1978. Gentlemen. This was the wall of fame. And it was impressive. Extremely impressive. He'd met a few of these people, most were casual encounters. But the rest of the photos were just plain fakes. But even a top lobyist doesn't make the kind of dough that Mitch was spending. [drums beating] And some people wondered if perhaps Mitch was independently wealthy. The perks of political power were plentiful. It realized at least one of his childhood dreams. He'd gotten the girl and her friend and her friend's sister. But spending more than three nights with any woman made Mitch nervous. Until... Excuse me. Now this woman was different. She was a successful business person in her own right. She had two children from a previous marriage. And most importantly, she would be busy. She would leave Mitch to his own devices. So, you're a lawyer? My business represents clients, who have difficulty assessing certain lines of communication -necessary for their success. -Ah. I have no idea what you just said, but you're obviously overpaid for it. I'm a consultant. -[waves crashing] -[seagulls squawking] Did anyone ever tell you, you have the most amazing eyes? Did anyone ever tell you that you have the most amazing eyes? Yeah. -Who? -You just did. [laughs in embarrassment] What's that? [kissing sounds] In August of 1985, Mitch Parker married Candace Law in Las Vegas, Nevada. And they settled into his comfortable house in Malibu with Candy's two children. Dennis: Ice. -Mitch: I'll be late. -Candy: Oh, sweetie. Okay. But Mitch was very careful to keep his personal life and his political life separate. [woman panting] Incredibly, Candy never knew where Mitch worked. and could only reach him through a message service. But, as it turned out, Candy wasn't busy enough. I'll do some buying for the shop. I can visit Susan. I'll take her to the theater and museums-- I'll take you to New York. I'll show you New York City like you've never seen that city before. Mitch: But right now I can't afford the distraction, please. Oh. All right. I wouldn't want to be a distraction. Candy, this is a mega, mega deal. Yeah, of course it is. They're all mega deals. I never see you anymore. [slams door] Mitch knew he had a problem that wasn't going to go away. -Candy. Come on honey. - He had to move her out of town, which wasn't easy because she was devoted to her business, which was also thriving. This was a tough one. Candy: Wait a second. Let me just finish December. [whispering] Honey, I need to talk to you right now, please. -What is it? You're scaring me. -Come and sit down. Candy: What, honey? Tell me. I wanted to tell you for a long time, believe me. -But they wouldn't le me. -Who wouldn't? -The government. -What are you talking about? I'm an operative, Candy. I work for the CIA. The CIA? Mitch: Yes, I have for about five years. -What? -Mitch: I know this must be hard. -Why didn't you tell me? -My job is known as deep cover. Nobody, nobody knew. Why are you telling me now? Because an agent's body was found outside of Paris and they're afraid I may have been compromised and they're moving us to Florida, on Thursday. -[stutters] To Florida? -Mitch: Yes. And I have to go to Nicaragua. You'll have to make the move on your own. I'm so sorry. [sighs] Mitch, what uh...the kids' school and my business. I know. I tried. They just... They won't let us stay. Mitch: You see that's why I couldn't take you to my office. Because I didn't have one. That is why I'm always travelling. I'm sorry. [whispers] My God, Mitch. Are you in danger? -Yes. -[Candy sighs] -Mitch: I'm sorry. - So, while Candice packed up the family and sold her business, Mitch was off on his dangerous mission in Nicaragua. Finally after four weeks, the phone rings, the Pope answers. Sister Theresa says, "Hey JP, it's Terry. I'm in L.A." [laughs] Hey Mitch, can I talk to you? Excuse me. Man: Terrific. Woman: Did you get it? -Having a good time, Senator? -Yeah. Until daddy takes the T-Bird away. [sighs] How'd it go with CLC? They're wondering when to expect to reach the floor. -I'd say within a month. -Excellent. That's what I told them. [envelope rustles] Senator, what's your position on the Eggleton forestry bill? [laughter in background] -Mitch: That's what I told them. -[laughs] This is the living room. -It's small, but really cute. -Mitch: Nice, beautiful. What do you think of those drapes? The drapes? Uh, nice. I like them. Mitch! They're absolutely hideous. Mitch: Oh, I thought you bought them. No, I got shutters. They're won-- Wow, you have no taste. -You're sleeping in your car. -No, I hate them. Oh, it's such a relief. Bedrooms are over there. That's for later. This is the dining room. This is a new dining set and you like it. -Do I like it? -You love it, actually. -I love it! -That's wonderful. Kids. Come on, honey. -Look who's here?! -Boy: Daddy! Boy: Daddy, watch this! -[water splashes] -[both cheer] That's great. Samantha, come on give daddy a hug. Come on. How are you? -How was Nicaragua? -Oh, it was tough. Pretty bad. I'm so glad they let you home. And Mitch juggled his married life in Florida... -Boy: Throw. Okay, give it here. -[Mitch and the boys screech] and his single life in Los Angeles successfully for the next five years. Man: Thank you, very much. Mitch: Thank you. You're not going out dressed like that, because I said so. Now go and change, right now! Don't you have a secret mission to go on? Samantha knock it off! Do not talk to Mitch like-- -You always take his side. -[angrily] I side... -[TV in background] -[door slams] Well teenagers! They say they become human again eventually. -I'm sorry. -That's all right. -What time do you leave? -Early. It's Kuwait, isn't it? -Honey! -Mitch, please! There's going to be a war. And I have a right to know. Yes, it's Kuwait. Be careful. But Mitch was like a juggler, who had six balls in the air and couldn't resist trying to make it eight. -Excuse me, you're in my seat. -Sorry. I don't like to sit next to the window. Too close to the action for me. Even if the flaps don't flap, you don't wanna know about it? Don't even make a joke. -[loud thud] -[groans nervously] I think they just closed the cargo door. But if you want to dig your nails in my arm, you're welcome. [sighs] I'm sorry. [woman heaves] [passengers chatter] You know there isn't really that much danger. Not until we get in the air. [music playing on headphones] Mitch: It was bizarre. My mother and father went to theater. - She thought he was asleep. -[Liz laughs lightly] He was 58 years old, a beautiful man. Incredible. So kind. I'm sorry. Anyway, I found myself heir to a ridiculous amount of money. I also was getting worse and worse. Finally, I went to a doctor. And then, another and they told me it wasn't an ulcer at all. It was -pancreatic cancer. -Oh, my God! I'm sorry. They gave me a year to live, two on the outside. I went nuts and just started spending money like crazy. Buying things. Buying all sorts of things. It's amazing the toys you can buy with the right frame of mind -with a few million dollars. -Yes, I know. My company sells some of those toys. I'm not proud of everything I did, but I was able to put a few million dollars away for my children. -You have kids? -No. No, I'm not even married. Not yet. But I hope to, some day. Are you doing any chemotherapy or radiation or anything? Nothing. There's not a speck of cancer left in my body. What! They call it spontaneous remission. I call it a miracle. [huffs out a breath] Sorry. I get emotional when I talk about it. That's all right. Really, that's... -Thank you. -That's... I'm running so late. This Brazilian designer is going on and on in Portuguese. I'm sorry, I don't speak Portuguese. Did he call? No, did you notice the rainforest in our kitchen? What? If Cal sent me flowers like that, I'd think he was cheating on me. What're you talking about? -Oh, good grief! -I like this guy, Lizzie. It's just dinner. Well if you don't marry him, give him my number. Liz: So, tell me what're you doing tonight? Cal's taking me to a Hockey game. Liz: Whoo. Ho, ho, ho. You're wearing the DK? -This is not just dinner. -This is dinner and the opera. Don't look at me like that. [sighs] We were going to the opera, but I opted for beer and dogs at the King's game instead. [whispers] Bye. -Roommate: I won't wait up. -Liz: Don't. Mitch found himself obsessed with the woman from the airplane. Maybe it was her spirit. Perhaps it was her perfume. But over the next six weeks, he pursued Lizzie Wells with relentless determination. Liz: [laughs] Stop. Quit fooling around. -[Mitch making funny sounds] -Liz: Quit clowning around. Give me that. So if you could be any actor in the circus, -what would you be? -Uh, trapeze artist. -Why? -You're high above everyone and you're flying through the air and you let go, and you're spinning and everyone wonders, "Will they make it?" -What about you? -Elephant. Elephant? I would never have to worry about my weight ever again. [both laugh] You know you're becoming a problem. -Oh. -I'm falling in love with you. And that's a problem? -[kissing] -[Liz moaning] [Lizzie exhales] That was so nice. -What's that? -What? Something sharp under the pillow. -What? What's that? -[whispers] Oh, my God! -I think that's yours. -[Liz exclaims] Oh, it's beautiful. Oh Mitch, it's so beautiful. Now, you might be saying, "Hold on. Isn't he already married to Candy?" That's right. And happily, too. But any ordinary guy can have one wife. Anchorman: Now, a further report from Kuwait City, by our correspondent Michael McMillan. McMillan: With rotors spinning, set against a clear blue sky, the winds have kept.... Mitch? Oh my God! Kids! I think I saw your daddy on TV. [shouts] Get in here, quick. I think I saw dad on TV. Pastor: If there are any here who can show a just cause why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony-- Where? I don't see him. He was coming out of a building. Maybe they'll go back. I don't think so, mom. By the power invested in me by the state of Nevada-- Go back. Go back. Pastor: I now pronounce you man and wife. [crying] Mitch. Oh baby, where are you? You may kiss the bride. Mitch, oh! Oh, baby. I'm so glad you're okay. -Hey, I saw you. -You did? Where? I saw you on TV, on CNN. In Kuwait. You were coming out of some building, like a bunker or something? Honey, was that you? Candy, I told you, you must never ask me these questions. I can't talk about these things. -Yes, it was. -[laughs] I knew it. [shouts] Hey kids! Look who's home. Mitch: Hey! -What are we in? -Man: Clubs. Clubs. Well, lay 'em down. That's it for me. -Here you go. Good luck. -[all sigh] -Woman: That's it? -That's it. Go for the big slam. I'm gonna go get some fresh air. Okay, diamonds are my favorite, but I don't have any. Candy! Aw! I love-- I'm sorry I didn't call you. Been tied up in meetings. I miss you so much. -Liz: When are you coming? -Tomorrow, I hope. -Liz: Is it very cold there? -Cold? It's a blizzard. I'm in the middle of a blizzard here. It's twelve below zero with the windchill factor. It's terrible. -Liz: It's what? -It's twelve below zero here. -It's freezing. -Liz: It's a bad connection. Terrible static. l will call you right ba-- No, no. Hold on. -Liz: What's the number of the hotel? -No, eh-- Somebody's at the door. Hold on a sec. [loudly] Yeah come on in. Hold on. [loudly] Yeah, put it on the table right there. Wait a second. Where's the sandwich? I ordered a sandwich. Honey can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Bye. Um, yeah. I don't know. [laughs] Samantha: Can I call you back. Yeah, okay. What? You don't like me, do you? Yeah, sure I do. You don't have to like me. You just have to respect my privacy. [whispers] Respect my privacy and I'll respect yours. I've no idea what you're talking about. I think you do. Do you understand? [speaks slowly] Do you understand? Yes. Thank you, Samantha. -Hi. -Hi. -What's wrong? -I just called in. -Oh, don't tell me. When? -Tomorrow. Mitch, don't they know you just got home? Yes, they do know. They don't care. Sorry. I don't know how much more of this I can take myself. -What are you up to? -[Candy laughs] I've only got you for nine more hours. I'm making the most of them. Mitch was on top of the world. A fantastic world of his own creation. What could possibly go wrong? I'm being indicted in the morning. I don't know how wide it will be. Obviously they're gonna talk to you. Well, you've got nothing to worry about, Bob. Bob: Good. [takes a deep breath] Do I? Bob, do I have anything to worry about? I'll do what I can. If someone were to give me up, [laughs] I think that would be unfortunate for a lot of people. I know it would. I know, Mitch. Because I just happen to know a lot. A lot more than the FBI could possibly dream of knowing. -Are you threatening me, Mitch? -Mitch: No. Everything will be fine, Bob. But with the Senator Belding pipeline cut off, Mitch had a serious cash-flow problem. First stop, Phil Dubrowski, president of the West Valley Chamber of Commerce. Tell me what's the problem? I'm dying. It's my heart. Oh, Mitch. -There's nothing they can do? -Mitch: No, they've ruled out transplant. They're treating me with drugs right now. They say my only chance is a procedure called Percutaneous Valvuloplasty. [laughs] But it's experimental, so the insurance company -won't pay for it. -Do you need some help? How much? Ten thousand. Ten thousand. Mitch: If by chance those checks don't come on time, I've got some paintings in my office. They're worth a lot. Or I could make you beneficiary on one of my insurance policies. I don't need your insurance, Mitch. By the end of the day, Mitch had raised over $50,000, including twenty for a children's hospital wing that he had absolutely nothing to do with. Mitch: "And thank you for your time. Sincerely..." Did Congressman Rijos' office call? No. -Why isn't he returning my call? -I don't know. Is this a bad time to tell you that my check bounced again? -Mitch: It did? -[telephone rings] Just put it through again. I swear, I'm gonna change banks. Tha bank is lousy. Secretary: Mitch Parker Associates. Hold please. -Are you in for Phil Dubrowski? -No. Tell him at the clinic. -What clinic? -Heart. [people chattering] Mitch: Excuse me everyone. May I have your attention for a moment, please? Recently, I took a leap that I'm sure most of you thought I would never have the courage to take. [guests laughing politely] I would like to introduce you to someone. My soul mate and my new bride, Liz Parker. [guests cheer and applaud] -Guests: Congratulations! -[whistle and cheer] -Mrs. Parker? -Should I eat one of these? -It's quite good. -No. Phil Dubrowski. Congratulations. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, Phil. -Mitch is really looking good. -Hmm. Isn't he? I mean, considering what he's been through. I know. The stress would kill most people, but Mitch, he seems to thrive on it. -Liz: Hey Jenny, how are you? -Jenny: Fine. Excuse me. Thank you, Eric. Talk to you Monday, okay? Senator, good to see you. You fellas know my good friend Mitch? This man is very good. He can make things happen. Only thing he's not good at is returning phone calls. [Mitch laughs nervously] Why didn't you return my calls? We've got history. We go back. Yeah, can I talk to you for a second? Would you excuse us? I don't think it's such a good idea that you're here today. I came along to celebrate all your good fortune. -You got hitched. I got ditched. -Well, you don't understand. I'm telling you to leave. Your turn will come. Bruce, the Senator is ready to go home now. Thank you. Good to see you. -Phil! -Terrific party. -Thanks for coming. -How're you feeling, Mitch? I feel great. It's a miracle. [whispers] It's a tiny little scar... [shouts] Pete, I'll be right there. [whispers] It's a tiny little scar and everything's wonderful. I'll tell you all about it, okay? Thanks. Good to see you. Mitch's financial situation was bad and getting worse. Maintaining two families on opposite coasts was becoming impossible. And bringing Candy back to L.A. was out of the question. -Dennis: Dad, look at me -That's good, Dennis. But then, a lucky coincidence presented itself. And Mitch's fertile imagination was ignited. [electric shaver buzzes] If you can't bring Mohammed to the mountain, you gonna have to bring the mountain to Mohammed. Yeah. No, no. First of all Sidney, I have to say it's a very generous offer. No. It's not the money at all. [laughs] You're not making this very easy for me. No, I couldn't ask Liz to do that. Yeah. We have a very happy life here. Yeah. No, Sid. I'll tell you what. Why don't you tell them that I thought it was a very generous offer and I appreciate it. Okay? All right. Thank you. -How was work? -Good. What was that? Nothing. Just business. -So, what couldn't you ask me? -Nothing. Okay, fine. Don't tell me. Liz. That was Sid Gold, from Disney. He wanted to talk, 'cause I did a little business for his studio a couple of weeks ago and it turned out very well. And so, I took a meeting with them and they offered me a job. -I just turned it down. -What kind of a job? Director of expansion, as on new projects. Why would you even take the job interview? I thought you were positioning yourself to run for office. To tell you the truth, my secret dream has always been to make movies. And I think I was just indulging my fantasy. It's over. Sorry. Mitch. Liz, the job isn't even here. It's in Orlando, Florida. Orlando, Florida. I don't know what got into me. I'll be fine. [sighs loudly] [Mitch laughs] [whispers] Florida. Mitch. I don't believe you. How can you turn down an opportunity like this without even talking to me first? If I had a chance to fulfill one of my dreams, -wouldn't you have helped? -What about your job? I'll get another job. I'm a qualified individual. Besides, I am gonna be wanting little Parkers running around soon. My parents are there. They'll turn babysitters. -You're unbelievable. -Hmm. Should I call? Yeah. Sid Gold, please. Mitch Parker. Automated Time: At the tone, the time will be six forty and thirty seconds. -Sid, Mitch. Yeah. -[time information playing] You're not gonna believe this. Yup. -Nervous? -No, -Your hand is sweating. -Well, that's-- -So, you are nervous. -I just want them to like me. -Liz's mom: Liz? -Liz: Mom. -Liz's mom: Liz! -Liz: Mom! Somewhere I went over land some ship to the Panama Canal. It all depended on the state of the market. -Liz: Dad travels a lot. -Mitch: Really? Where? South America, South Africa, Middle East. Africa! Beautiful. I've been to Africa. Two months on safari in Kenya. -You did? -Yeah. Mom was in Africa. I was in Kenya on a photo shoot. -Really? -And where did you go? -[stutters] Nairobi. -Liz's mom: I mean, on Safari. [nervously] Where didn't I go. Everywhere. It's uh, beautiful. -Maasai Mara? -No, I didn't get there. I just didn't have time. -You didn't go there? -Mitch: No. Liz's mom: Well, I'm sure it was very exciting. -Did you build this house? -Yes, we did. Then you'd probably know where the bathroom is. [all laughing] Liz's mom: Yes, I'm sorry. Get right in there and make a left. Thank you. Mitch had succeeded in bringing his two families together. Now, he could concentrate on business again. Mitch's trips to L.A. for Disney, were actually trips across town to Candy. [family chatters] And Liz found their dream house less than 15 minutes away. Thank you. -Mitch: It's ours honey. -Yeah! -Get over here. -[Liz screams] -Liz: Oh my God! -[realtor laughs] -Liz: Oh, no, no! -[realtor laughs] -Yeah, did Delta Corp come in? -Secretary: Yes, on Wednesday. - Thirty thousand dollars. -That's great, Janice. I want you to cut me a check for $20,000 and send it on down. I can't. I've already paid it out and I have a stack here-- All right, don't worry about it. What else is coming in? Secretary: Nothing that I know of. I sent those loan papers from Mr. Dubrowski down to you. -Don't worry about him. - Well, he calls everyday. Don't worry about him, all right? Did the Bahamas guy call? Yes, the Minister of Trade's Office. They want you to come to the Bahamas for a meeting. Great. That is beautiful. Listen, Janice. I'm gonna open an office down here, okay? And you're gonna get yourself a big fat raise. I'll talk to you. [exhales] Hey, honey. Oh, Mitch. Barbara Allston called. She said -we're gonna lose the house. -What! She said that your check was returned. -They have another offer. -That's just -a problem at the bank. I'll-- -Call them right away. I'll take care of it. I have some very exciting news. -What? -Let me make this call first. -What? You can tell me now. -We're going on a cruise. -Why? -To the Bahamas. I got to take care of some business. I want you with me. And I want to take your mom and dad with us. It'd be like a second honeymoon. Won't they'd like that? -Give them a call and ask them. -Well, honey, I-- I got to call the bank. [exhales deeply] Hi, it's me. [laughs] Do you want to go to the Bahamas? Liz: I though it was gonna be one of those big things. Liz's dad: Our own private yacht. Liz's mom: Now this is way too extravagant. Liz's dad: Ask me [laughs]. Nothing's too extravagant for my folks. What do you think, dad? -You like it, mom? -It's-- -Come on, let's get aboard. -Liz: All right. [indistinct dialogue] -Ahoy there! -Liz: Hi. -Welcome aboard The Dove. -Mitch: Thank you. [inaudible dialogue] -[phone rings] -Candy: Hello. Mitch: I can only talk for a few seconds, honey. This may not be a secure phone. [Candy on phone] Oh honey, I miss you so much. Where are you? I'm on a ship in the Gulf of Oman. All the devastation, Candy. I can't begin to tell you. It's terrible. They just brought a young child on board Samantha's age. Mitch: Burns over 90% of his body. Oh, Mitch. -I hope the poor thing dies soon. -[merry chattering in background] -How are the children? -Candy: They're good. -When're you coming home? -Mitch: In about two weeks. Mitch: Do you have enough money in the account? -Yeah, we're okay. -Because I don't think I can get my check in this month. -We'll be fine. - Okay, good. -Listen, I have to go now. -Mitch-- -I have to go. I love you. - Mitch-- -[exhales] -[merry chattering] [bicycle bell ringing] Doug, put some more ice on this lobster, will you? I want it nice and cold. -I'm looking for Mitch Parker. -Yes. Are you with the Minister of Trade's Office? I'm afraid Mr. Everhart has had to cancel. We didn't know how to reach you, exactly. That's all right. We can reschedule for tomorrow. No. That would be impossible, I'm afraid. [laughs] I don't understand. I had an appointment. Yes, he did ask me to tell you, next time you're in the Bahamas, why don't you give him a call. No, no, wait a second. He made an appointment with my office in Los Angeles [screams] to meet him here. I'm sorry. Would you mind telling me what's going on? Well off the record, he's heard something about your associations in Los Angeles, which have made him feel uncomfortable. I see. Nice to have met you. [ship horn] Liz: Hey! -Look what we got. -Hi. Fertility. [policeman's whistle blows] Liz's mom: John, stop. You're-- Liz: It was one of those really snooty affairs, you know? Black tie, crystal, the whole works. [laughs] So Barbara comes out of the ladies room-- Oh, please don't do this to me. And she was wearing this exquisite black dress, only with a train of toilet paper peeping out of the bottom of it. -[all laughing] -It was stuck in her pantyhose. Oh stop it. She was winding around the dining room, across the study, down the hall and she's still attached to the bathroom. [Liz laughs] This is this crazy family that you've married into. Excuse me, sir. Can I see you for a moment? Sure. Don't tell another story till I get back, please. Don't worry. -I hate you guys. -I love you, ma. -It was so cute. -It was not cute. All right, it wasn't. It was dignified. You turned and saw the paper and went back like Greta Garbo. Liz's mom: Not everybody can pull that off. Liz: Not everyone can. Liz's dad: Is there a problem? [laughs shamefacedly] The bank has confused my account with some other card holder's and now they're refusing to accept my card. -A little tight? -I'm so embarrassed, John. I'm sorry. I'll pay you back as soon as we get back. -How much do you need? -Five hundred. -I need the travel checks. -Oh. You think mom and dad are having a good time? Liz: Uh-huh [exhales loudly] -What's going on? -Hmm. What? At the restaurant. What's going on? It's just a little mistake. I'll get that straightened out. -[exasperatedly] Mitch. -What? It's... It's just that it doesn't really make sense. I mean, they bounce the check for the deposit on the house-- That was a totally different bank. I'll talk to my accountant and get it all straightened out. You can't take my parents to such an expensive restaurant -and expect them to pay. Just-- -[Mitch laughs] I'll pay your father back as soon as we get back to Miami. You don't understand. He won't take the money. He's too-- What do you want me to do about that? I want you to tell me what's going on. That was really embarrassing. You ungrateful bitch. All you do is take, take, take and now you sit here and complai-- Mitch! [exhales] I... Liz: Hi. Liz's mom: Hi, sweetie. I'm going to the Gleason's to pick up the drapery material. You want to come? -I can stop stripping? -Yeah. Yeah. There's some lemonade right over there. I'll be right back. I'm not procrastinating, I'm just taking a break. -Hi. -Hi, daddy. -Don't be mad at me. -Why would I be mad at you? I, uh, checked up on Mitch. You checked up on him? Why? Honey, doesn't it seem sometimes that Mitch is a little uh... He doesn't work for Disney. How do you know that? -You ever been to his office? -No, it's not finished yet. It's being renovated. I called Bernie Stops. He works for Mitch's bank. His checks don't come from Disney. Lizzie. You mad at me? [phone rings] Recorded message: You've reached the offices of Mitch Parker at Walt Disney Productions. Please leave your message after the tone.[beeps] Hi, it's me. I'm at my parents' house. Can you call me when you get this? [phone ringing] -Hello? -Mitch: Hi, babe. - Everything all right? -Yeah. Where are you? I'm at my office. Why? I-- I wanted to come by. - Now? -Yeah. [stuttering] I'm going into a meeting right now. When can I come by? - Tomorrow would be good. -Okay. Yeah, okay, tomorrow. - How about lunch? -Yeah. -I'm here to see Mitch Parker. -Guard: Your name please? Liz Parker. Thank you, Mrs. Parker. 15th floor. Make a left hand turn when you come out of the elevator. Thanks. [knocking] You found me? [exhales in relief] Mmm-hmm. This is very, very impressive. And really, reallty nice. Not bad for a kid from Ohio, huh? Oh, God. Why did I let you talk me into a Las Vegas wedding. And how am I gonna tell our children? I'll tell and if you're good I'll get you a get you a spot in my next movie. -You'd do that for me? -Hush. Let's have lunch. Mitch: Commissary? -Commissary? -Sure. -No I wanna go big time. -Okay, [door slamming] I'm gonna call Barbara and see for closing date to set on the house. -I already did. -Really? - Yes, June 15th. -[Liz squeals] -We can start moving in... Candy: All right, sweet heart. We'll have that again next week. [engine roaring] -[tires squealing; cars honk] -[Liz screams] Mitch! Why did you do that? -You didn't see that? -What! You didn't see that guy back there? -No. -He had a gun. -He pointed a gun at me. -Should we call the police? No. [Liz exhales heavily] -Just keep driving. -God! Why did Mitch move two wives into the same small town? That is not totally clear. What is clear is that it was a huge mistake. [takes deep breaths] I'll be right out. [car door opens and slams] One of them would have to go. -Mitch shouting: Candy. -Candy: Mitch. -Mitch: Are you all right? -Candy: Well, yes. What's wrong honey? [water splashing] What! [inaudible] -We have to activate the plan. -Oh, my God! The plan, we have to activate it. -How much time do we have? -We have an hour. -Dennis is outside, baby. -Get the kids, get the kids. Candy: Dennis! -Mitch: I'll get the luggage. -Okay. Candy: Dennis! Come home right now. -Dennis: What's wrong mom? -Candy: Just get home! I'll take the kids to Pennsylvania. That's a good idea. We'll stay with your parents just in case. -In case of what, Mitch? -Where's Samantha? She's in her room! Honey, in case what? -What's going on mom? -Okay. Sweetie, just go pack your things. Just what you need, okay? Like we planned. Let's go. Pack your things. We're out of here in one hour. -What! -We're outta here in an hour! Pack! [door slams] I want to say goodbye to Scott and Jamie. No honey, it's gotta be a really big secret, okay? We can't talk to anybody. Pack your bag. Sammy: I'm not going! What about our stuff? We'll pack everything up as soon as it's safe. -I'm not going mo-- -[screams] Samantha please, don't do this right now. -Look, I've got stuff with-- -Do you think this is some kind of game? We are in danger here. -Do you understand that? -Oh, right! Go and pack right now, young lady! -Go, go. -Sammy: I hate you! -[slams door] -Huh, I'm sorry I-- -It's okay. I have to go. -You're not going with us, Mitch? Now that they've discovered me, I don't want to follow you. -I want them to follow me. -[Candy exhales] Mitch, I'm scared. There are agents watching the house. They'll follow you all the way to Pennsylvania, okay? -Where are they? -If you can see 'em, they wouldn't be very good, would they? -I love you, honey. -I love you. Be careful. I will. You'll be all right. I'll call you in Pennsylvania. It'll be all right. [Candy sobs] Okay. Mitch: All right. I love you. This place is a mess. There's boxes everywhere. I need an assistant. Did you get those flowers I sent you? Janice: Yes, thanks. And you'll tell me when I can cash my check right? Absolutely. What've we got coming in? Well, I'm still waiting to hear from the Minister of Trade's office. Forget about that bum. That trip to the Bahamas was a bust. [elevator bell rings] Mitch: I want you to call Congressman Rios. Hi, Mr. Dubrowski. I'm not here. Janice: Uh, can I help you with something? No, thank you. What's he doing? He's putting your paintings in a cardboard box. -The good ones? -Uh-huh. Can I give Mr. Parker a message for you? No I'll tell him myself. Mitch, if you want any of the stuff back, I'll sell it to you for $10,000. I'll call you back. [bangs the receiver] -And you re-deposited the check? -Barbara: Yes, twice. Now, the other thing is your credit report came back with a lot of problems. So, the sellers have gone ahead and accepted another offer. -I am sorry. -I see. Well, listen Barbara. I think you handled this whole sale extremely unprofessionally. And I won't be doing business with you again. Good bye. Mr. Parker if you will excuse me-- Mitch: Read it and weep. What's this? It's a geological survey on our house. [laughs] We have a few problems. There's cracks all through the foundation, -water seepage everywhere. -Oh, no. Our dream house was built on a swamp. -This is not swampland. -It's not a swampland anymore. It's landfill. It was a swamp. I have a good mind to sue these bastards. I think I will. Oh, God! On a swamp! I need a drink. 7-8-9-0, Parker. P-A-R-K-E-R. That's Candy and Mitch. [birds chirping] Mitch: Okay, so you definitely got the change of address? And the next statement will go to Pennsylvania? Can you tell me when last month's statement was mailed? [paper rustling] Thank you. [phone clicks off] Guess who's going to Europe this afternoon? I give up. That was the office on the phone. Trying to get Tom Cruise to sign a development deal. Sid wants me to go along. I think they're grooming me for the film division. Tom Cruise? [snickers] Yeah I'm gonna have dinner with him tonight. [crickets chirping] Mitch: Ah, man, I can't believe this happened again. I keep changing my card number but this guy keeps finding the number. I guess I'm just gonna have to prosecute. I don't want to but... Okay, the truth. I met this woman on an airplane. And I fell in love with her. And I married her. It's not that I don't love you anymore. I-- I keep changing the number, but he keeps finding it. I'm gonna prosecute. [car door opens and shuts] Can you tell me where you've been? I've been everywhere, Los Angeles, Miami, Washington. Tomorrow morning, I have to leave for Israel. Where is everyone? My parents took Dennis to a basketball game. -How's he handling it? -Oh, he's okay. He misses his friends. Mitch, Samantha's gone. She ran away basically. What? I mean, she's in Los Angeles with her father, but... she doesn't want to come back. -I'm sorry about that. honey. -I don't know. It's probably the best thing for her. So, it's good. Uh, credit card bill came. -It's maxed out, right? -Yeah. Let me see that. It was stolen. -It was stolen? -The credit card was stolen. Well, this guy's having a lot of fun, huh? The Bahamas, furniture, lingerie. -Well, the lingerie's mine. -[laughs] It's not the first time he's done this. Give me the number. Let's call them right now. Doesn't matter. The card's run to it's limit. -But we should call them, Mitch -It's okay. There's more important, pressing business to deal with right now. Come on. [footsteps receding] -When's the game over? -We've got time. [paper rustling] Liz: Honey, this doesn't make sense. Liz: Why don't we just stay in the apartment? I don't want to stay in the apartment anymore. It's driving me crazy. Besides, why let an investment property sit empty? -Then, why don't you rent it? -Because they want to sell it. The last tenants drove me crazy. [water spraying] What do you think? -Well, I think it's kinda cute. -Nice isn't it? Yeah. [Liz moaning] [Liz giggling] [water spraying against wall] Hello, Mary. I thought you'd be up at the lake. No, Tom's brother got a stroke, Oh, that's too bad. I'll come and visit in a bit. What did I do with the house keys? They're right here. -Shall we take a look inside? -Yeah. Well you're right, honey. That-- You don't even want to hear the tale Mitch spun to convince Liz that, contrary to everything he'd said on the way to the house, they didn't in fact want to live in that house after all. Suffice it to say, Liz was getting whiplash from the ride Mitch was taking her on. Man: Mrs. Parker, may I speak to you for a moment please? Certainly. But this was nothing to the ride Candy was about to take. This account is seriously overdrawn. Aah, no, I only opened it last week and it should have over $12,000 dollars in it. But there was a large withdrawal and several checks after that. Uh, what withdrawal? On the 16th, your husband zeroed out the account. -$11, 242 dollars. -[takes a deep breath] He must've moved the money. So, I need to talk to my husband. No. You're not understanding me. -The card was stolen. -Woman: Are you certain? Yes! My husband reported it stolen three days ago. I have no record of that. Your husband is Mitchell Parker, is that correct? Yes. What about the signatures, huh? Have you even checked the signatures? This account has a month of charges, ma'am. If the card was stolen, it should have been reported immediately. Look, there's over $20,000 on this card. [angrily] Neither my husband nor I made the purchases. I'm looking at these signatures and they appear to be authentic, ma'am. Shall I connect you with our Payment Plan office? [paper slams against wood] [door opens] [light switch clicks] Did I know you were coming into town? No. Why are you sitting on the floor? Well, thank God you're here. We've got problems. I would say that the most pressing is the Chadway account. -It's over, Janice. -What do you mean? It means I owe a lot of money. That's it. I'm closing up shop. But you can keep all the office equipment. Computer, fax machine, phones, everything. -Are you serious? -Yeah. It'll cover the money I owe you. Well, I have a stack of bills here. What am I supposed to do with these? Close the door and walk away. And my number in Florida... I guess I don't have your number in Florida. Thanks. Thanks for everything, Janice. [footsteps receding] [door shuts] [sighs] [phone ringing] Mary: Tom. Tom, you got that? [phone ringing] Did you put your hearing thing in? Tom: What? -Hello - Hi Mary. It's Candy. Candy! Where are you? What in God's name is going on? Can't really explain anything right now. But, uh... you haven't by any chance seen Mitch, have you? Mitch. As a matter of fact, Candy, we saw him last Friday. -Where? -Well, here at your house. -Mary, are you sure it was him? - I talked to him. Candy, I don't know if you want to hear this. I've been just sick about it, but, he wasn't alone. Well, who was he with? He was with a woman. Oh Mary, that was probably just somebody from work. I don't know what kind of work Mitch does exactly, but this woman was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top. What were they doing? Mary? Honey, they were kissing. Liz: I'm losing my mind. I'm going insane. -What's the matter? -We are being evicted -from the apartment. -What do you mean? I mean that Mitch didn't pay the rent and they want us out. I'm out there shopping for homes that are half a million dollars and we can't even come up with $800 a month rent for an apartment. What is wrong with this picture? -What does Mitch say about ti? -I don't know. He's in New York, or he's in L.A., or he's somewhere. Why don't you try to calm down. Make yourself a sandwich. There's some tuna fish there. [exhales] What? Just say it. I already said it. You know how I feel. That he doesn't work for Disney. Daddy, I was in his office. I was in his office. Hello. I need to reach my husband. And he's an agent. His name is Mitchell R. Parker. Woman: I'm sorry, I show no record of a Mitchell R. Parker with the CIA. I understand you can't give the information out over the phone. But please, this is really a family emergency. I can turn this over to the supervisor and perhaps he can help. -Can I help you with something? -No, thank you. Excuse me, ma'am. I am so sorry, Mr. Parker. Ma'am, can we help you with something? This is Anthony Tobias, CIA Personnel, Washington. I understand you're trying to reach you husband, - a Mitchell R. Parker? -That's right. We have no Mitchell Parker working at the Agency. Well... I have a password. It's Paper Chase. Ma'am, it's not a question of passwords. According to our records, Mitchell R. Parker does not work for the CIA and never has. I'm sorry. [airplane hum] [phone rings in background] -Candy: Hello. -It's me. Where are you? It doesn't matter where I am. I just wanted to call and let you know I'm still alive. Well Mitch, um, I was just so frightened that they'd murdered you, that I called the CIA. Why would you do that? I told you never to contact them. Don't you understand how that would compromise things? Don't bother Mitch. [laughs hysterically] You see, the CIA has never heard of you. Of course they haven't. They're not gonna identify one of their agents over the phone. Who is she? [loudly] Who is she Mitch? [sighs] It was just a one week fling, honey. I'm sorry, I've been under so much-- [screams] Is this happening to me? You leave us without a dime. With a $22,000 credit card bill and you run off with some woman. [sobbing] I'm sorry, honey. I really messed up. That's supposed to make me feel better? 'Cause you see, it doesn't. You are a liar and a cheat. And you've abandoned my children. And if there's any way for me to press charges, -I promise you Mitch-- -Are you threatening me? Oh, no. I am telling you. Is that supposed to be a threat? Because if it is, I promise you, if you go to the police and say one word, they'll be looking for a new mother for your children. My God! [phone slams] [Candy sobbing] [door opens] Mitch: Hey, honey. You're up pretty early. Is everything all right? Sit down, Mitch. Oh. If I'm in the doghouse I'd better get a cup of coffee. Mitch, sit down. Okay. -What is it? -[Liz sighs] I went to your office. I met Mitchell Parker. You don't work for Disney. Liz, I'm an independent contractor. I-- How do you earn your living? What do you think, I broke into his office? -You tell me. -What's wrong with you, Liz? How do you support us? [stutters] What's wrong? What-- They are evicting us from this apartment. They're not going to evict us. I'm holding the check -until we get the dryer fixed. -[yells] Will you just stop it? You really need to get help, you know that? -I can't take this anymore. -Liz , Liz-- -I'm going to my parents -No. And when you're ready to be honest with me, you call-- No Liz no, let me just explain something. Just-- No. Now, you have a serious, serious problem. And when you're ready to acknowledge that I will help you any way that I can. Don't! [whispers] Don't. [footsteps receding] -[door slams] -[Mitch sighs] [car engine roars] Liz' Friend: I mean, did he even look like Mitch? Ha. No. it was a 70-year-old bald man. -He was bald? -Yeah. And there was the exact same picture frame -with his family in it. -Oh, man. And the secretary, she flips out. She calls security and I'm escorted out of the building. -[Liz's friend laughs] -Hey. This is not funny. -[laughs] No, it's not not. -No, it was awful. You are supposed to be my best friend. I am. Liz: Maybe it was a little funny. [laughs] I'm not ready to just laugh at that, yet. [door slams] I don't know what I'm going to do. I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round, you know. I don't have a kleenex honey, wipe your nose. [sobs] I mean, I love him. He's a terrific guy, but these lies. Why would he want to lie to me? I think you've got to get Mitch into some serious shrinkage. And you've got to set the ground rules between the two of you. -That's what you've gotta do. -Yeah. -[Liz sighs] -It's gonna be all right. You'll see. That was Mitch. This crab just tried to bite me. -He wants to talk. -That's good. Good [crickets chirping] [door opens] -Hi. -Hi. Do you want to come in? [door shuts] -A drink? -Uh, no thanks. Liz. You were right. I lied. About Disney. I don't really work there, full-time... you see. So I don't have an office. You see, the kind of work I do for them, I-- -Mitch. -What? You don't work for Disney. You don't work for Disney. And you obviously have no money. Just stop lying. Can't you stop? I'm sorry. I did lie. I lied about... the money that I inherit. The $2 million. I inherited. It's all gone. I blew it. I spent it. And the will, it's being contested in court by my mother. And there's this protracted What's the matter? What-- You told me that your mother died when you were five. She did. I'm talking about my stepmother. [Liz sighs] -Mitch: Liz. Liz please don't leave me. Liz don't you... [door slaming] [keys rattling] [trunk door opens] [trunk slams shut] Man on TV: Let me spell it for you. Mile High Club. I thought you were leaving. There are guns in the back of your car. -I know. -Why? -I bought them. -Why? -Because. -Because why? Because I realized my life isn't worth living if you're not in it [footsteps fade] [door slams] Woman on TV: Oh, my God. [knocking] [knocking continues] -It's 1 in the morning. -I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself. I need to talk to you Liz. I just feel like-- -Mitch. -Please. Liz, I know I've been awful to you. But please, just give me a chance. I just... Please. Okay. I hope I didn't wake up your parents. They're not here. They're visiting my brother. -What's going on with you? -[Mitch sobs] I just feel like... I feel disconnected. I can't-- I-- Please don't... Don't give up on me just... -Please, just don't. -Mitch, I... I need you. Please, please. -Listen, let's make love. -No, I don't want to. -No Liz, let's make love, please. -No! stop it. -You used to love it-- -Stop It! You want to know what's wrong, Liz? You're ruining my life. You're bleeding me. No wonder I'm broke. You... You're bleeding me. You see, you're all alike. Because every time it's good, as long as it's good, everything's fine. But the moment it's bad, you just leave. What's going on down here? Nothing, everything's fine. -Back to bed, everything's fine. -[Liz gasps and cries] Take your hands off her, Mitch. I'll call the police, Mitch. -Let her go! -Don't you threaten me! Don't you threaten me! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. [Liz cries] No. [door slams] [loud knocking] [Liz shouting] [Liz crying] See what you do? See what you do to me? [loudly] You bitch! -Mitch: You make me nuts! -[Liz sobbing] -[Liz sobbing] -Mitch: Liz, I love you. [whispers] I love you so much. [breathing hard] Mitch: Liz, do you know what I have in my hand? Mitch: I have a gun. I want you to give me one reason why I shouldn't put this gun in my mouth and pull the trigger. Please. [door opens] [Liz gasps] He's gone. I called the police. [Liz sobbing] Oh, God. -It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. -I'm so scared. -I know. I know. -I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I know. It's okay. Barbara: I think the police are right. You should file a restraining order. He's never acted like this before. Before what? You just met the guy. -I did not, Dad. -Barbara: John. I don't want him coming near you. He threatened suicide, not homicide. Oh jeez, Liz. Look at your arm. That's assault. We're filing for a restraining order. I agree. Okay. I'm a little nervous about the time. -I'd better go. -John: I'll take you. It was so good seeing you again. Thank you for coming down. Thank you for being here for Liz. No problem. No problem. Well, what do you know about him that is true. Umm, well he was uh... He went umm... [sighs] -Who knows? -Okay, don't worry. Did you bring his license number? Yes I did. Do you think that you can help me? Oh, yeah. With a few phone calls and the grace of God, we'll be just fine. [gunshot] [breathing hard] [door opens] Liz. There are two names on the deed to the house at Castlebury. The same two names are on your husband's current California car registration. He's got a lot of calls going to Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania. Does Mitchell have a sister named Candace? Not that I know of. Does your husband travel a lot for his work? All the time. Why? [inaudible dialogue] [knocking] Candace Parker? Liz Parker? Yeah. Come on in. Liz, we're out of wine but I found some brandy. -No, that's fine. -It should be good. Tonight I'd drink nail polish remover. I've got plenty of that. Oh, ah, this. The last I talked to him, he threatened me too. I taped it for what it's worth. It is. This is our trip to the Bahamas. Oh, yeah. I'm still trying to figure out how to pay for that. No, no, no. I'm going to pay for that. It's going to take a little time, but I'm gonna to pay. [sighs] I just, uh... I can't believe how stupid I was. -You're not stupid. -Yes. [laughs] And neither am I. He's just very, very slick. So? So, we go to the police and we destroy him. [knocking] -Hello Marta. Is Liz here? -Marta: No, no here. I want to leave these flowers for her. I'll just leave a little note. [tap running] [phone buttons beep] Man on phone: US Air. This is Todd. How may I help you? Hello Todd. I'd like to make a reservation On Flight 149 tomorrow morning Orlando to Washington please. Okay. Hold a moment. I'm sorry. I'm showing Flight 149 is Orlando-Pittsburgh. Orlando-Washington at around that time would be Flight 215. [phone receiver crashes back] Liz: I'm going to meet Candace in Las Vegas when I get back. And we're going to file bigamy charges in Clark County. I think you're doing the right thing. I understand why she's mad. I really do. I mean I do. I know I screwed up. I really screwed up. Thank you for your help, Mr. Cox. In my experience, it would be best if you were to steer well clear of him. Sometimes, I feel that maybe I should just... You know, I used to pride myself on my insight and intuition. Boy, did I get this wrong! I'm sorry. Thanks. I think they're gonna do something to me. And I'm afraid. Do you know why I did everything that I did? Because I just wanted them to love me. That's all I ever wanted. Is that so wrong? Liz's recorded message: Mitch, I'm calling to let you know I'm moving away. I don't want you to try and find me. I don't ever want to talk to you or see you again. You can pick up your things at the Orlando Boulevard Storage Lockers. It's locker 2B. If you've lost your key, I'll leave mine at the office. Please don't come before 12 noon. Oh, and Mitch, I met Candy. We had a very interesting conversation. [answering machine beeps off] [glass shatters] Well, that's it. What time do we have to go? Narrator: On the morning of September 15th, Liz came down to breakfast. They set a time they would leave for the airport. Her father offered to help her collect her things from the storage locker. But she insisted he go to his tennis match instead. He won the 1st set. But lost the next two. [parking brake engages] -Hi. -Hi. -Moving? -Liz: I hope so. I just want to get out of here. Doesn't sound good. [steel rolling door screeches] -You're coming undone. -Sorry? -Liz: The box. Underneath. -[laughs] Oh, thanks. [car engine roars up] Why would I expect you to allow me this one last courtesy? [car door opens and shuts] Move, Mitch. You're not leaving. Move. Stop it, stop. [indistinct scuffle] Liz: Son of a-- [clattering] You need help. Serious help. Sick. [Pistol lock slides open] Hey! [Liz mouths] No. [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Gunshot] [gurgling sounds] Is she dead or what? [sirens wailing] Cops: Freeze. Don't move. Freeze. All right, face down, Now. Now! Hands behind your neck. At his trial, Mitch Parker claimed to have no memory of Liz's murder. Or ever having been married to a woman name Candy. Yes? Dr. Michael Reston testified that Mitch suffered from depression and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Hello. The signs of this disorder are: One, reacts to criticism with feelings of rage. Two, takes advantage of others to achieve his or her ends. Three, has a grandiose sense of self-importance. Four, has fantasies of unlimited success and power. Five, has a sense of entitlement. Six, obsessions with wanting more and more. Seven, desires to be associated with people of power. Eight, lacks empathy. Nine, preoccupation with self gratification. Ten, requires constant attention and adoration. In Dr. Reston's professional opinion, Mitch exhibited all ten of these symptoms. [both sobbing] The jury deliberated for three hours and returned a guilty verdict of murder in the first degree. Mitch's parents did not attend his trial. I came into this story at the very end. I only knew Liz Parker for an instant. A simple errand. Picking up a few boxes of books thrust me into the life of a vital, beautiful woman. And I've become obsessed. How could this happen? How could a guy sucker so many unsuspecting people for so long? You think he couldn't have suckered you? Was Mitch parker insane? I don't know. But when his extraordinary life fell apart, I believe he opted to become extra-ordinary in another way. In fact, he became Sardis, Ohio's most infamous citizen.
