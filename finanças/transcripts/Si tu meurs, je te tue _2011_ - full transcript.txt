La Santé Prison (Paris) IF YOU DIE, I'LL KILL YOU Eggs, please. Another. Thanks. Something wrong? No, how about you? I'm good, how about you? I'm good. Philippe. Avdal Cheto Pertube Belkhari. All that's your name? No, it's my name, my father's name, and my grandfather's. What about my rent? You still owe me 100 euros. Can we talk? Soon as I get paid, I'll settle up. You better. You're an attractive woman. You're drunk, get some sleep. - Boss? - What? Is this for disposal or recycling? Leave it. You've reached Abdullah Mizori, my mother Asia, my sister Siba... I didn't quite catch your name. You can call me Avdal. Have a glass? Red wine. "Avdal". What do you do, Avdal? I'm waiting. What for? Someone. I'm also waiting. What for? Everything. Gare du Nord? This late, the station's closed. - I know. - You got a place to stay? - You got a problem? - No, you've got a problem. You turned round first. I can turn round. But why did you turn round? - Because you turned round. - Let's just turn round, then. What brought you to France? I was in Belgium. I was sent to find an Iraqi war criminal. To find...you mean to kill him? Did you find him? He vanished. But I swear if I find him, I'll nail him. For my mother. Good night. Abdullah, give me Siba. What do you want with my sister? Fuck off Abdullah, put Siba on. Avdal? Siba, I gave up. I left Belgium. Are you OK? Where are you? In Paris. Paris! What's it like? Have you got your visa? Not yet. Tell me about Paris. Paris... Paris is pretty and calm, people are free and happy. I can't wait to be with you. Siba! I miss you... Hello. She's beautiful. - She's one in a million. - Yes. She's my true love. I'm here for her sake. Philippe, I need work. - It's rough. - Could you find me work? Any type of work? Any type of work. - Give me a photo of you. - What for? You'll see. Here: "Avdal Cheto Pertube Belkhari". Money first. No way, I haven't seen him yet. Then 50 euros now and you settle the rest with him. No, I must see him first. Avdal. Avdal, you getting off or what? Shit. Avdal. Driver, please call for help! My friend isn't well. If you die, I'll kill you. - His belongings go to me? - Yes. His fiancée. Right. Sign. There. - Is everything in order? - Yes. Sign. Thank you. Where are you going? Aren't we done? - What about the body? - The body? Am I responsible for the body? Aren't you? How does it usually work? Either you take care of it he goes in a common grave. I'm not his brother or family. I have enough on my plate as it is. And me? In any case you have five days. The exit's on the right. Goodbye. Arrival of Kurdis Airlines, flight 221, gate 2. Abdullah, it's me. Has Avdal called? Why would he call now you're there? Because he isn't here. He'll come. Paris is a big city. What do you know about Paris? You've never left Aqrah. Iraqi Kurdistan I told you not to go. Whatever. Put mom on. Abdullah? My name is Philippe. I'd like to speak to Siba. Darling, every day I come here to wait for you. Why don't you have the balls to get on the fucking plane? Why? What are you afraid of? So you missed the flight, never mind. You can catch the next one in three hours. Pour yourself a drink and get on the fucking plane. Just get on it. Excuse me. How do I get to Paris from here? How should I know? There's the Métro, buses, taxis... Are you also waiting for someone? Yes. Why don't you go fetch him? He's made me afraid of flying. Paris is an amazing city. You'll find him. Don't you have your fiancé's address? No. - What? - I'm on the plane. You got on? I don't believe it, my darling! - Will you come pick me up? - If you die, I'll kill you! He actually did it. I have to go back to the airport. Where are we? I'll drop you off at Gare du Nord. - Will that be OK? - Sure. Listen, I'm absolutely certain that you'll find him and be really happy in Paris. Abdullah, it's me. Have you heard from Avdal? A Frenchman called but all I understood was your name. Did he mention Avdal? I don't know, I understood nothing. But did he sound happy or sad? Sis, you can't tell whether a Frenchman is feeling happy or sad. He kept saying "Siba, Siba, Siba". Where are you? In a hotel. What a disgrace! My sister alone in a hotel! You dumbass! Give me mom. My daughter. He should have been there. You were wrong to trust him. You must come back. Avdal is my soul, he loves me. - You know him? - Is he Kurdish? Yes. - What do you want with him? - Nothing. Unfortunately, he's dead. - How did he die? - Natural death, I think. His heart, maybe. Hearts don't die natural deaths. Really? What do they die of? Chemical weapons, cancer, exile... All right. I wanted to reach his family. I don't speak Kurdish you see, so... Why me? Don't you speak Kurdish? Unfortunately not. The Turks forbid our language. Stop singing in Turkish. You speak Kurdish? - Hello. - Hello. - Are you Kurdish? - What do you want? Do you know him? No. What do you want with him? He's dead, I need a Kurdish-speaker to speak to his fiancée. This dead guy is Kurdish? - Dead as in dead? - Oh yes. - Did you know him? - No, but he was Kurdish. It's so sad. - Can you call him? - No. - Why not? - Mind your own business. - You have to call him. - Enough. I'm not a bearer of bad news. You have to! Look. - Must I speak to her? - Yes, she's his fiancée. OK, no problem. I'll do it. Get off my back. Her name is Siba, at this number. - OK. - OK. I'm Philippe. - Philippe? - Yes, my name is Philippe. You've reached Abdullah Mizori... It's a voicemail. His name is Abdullah. - Excuse me, are you Kurdish? - Yes. Yes. Do you know him? Hello. Do you know him? Thank you. Here's my number for Siba to call me. And I have bad news for you: Avdal is dead. It doesn't come from me. It's the Frenchman, Philippe. Tell him to call me. Call him. What's your number? Here are all of our numbers. What did I say? You have 24 hours. The exit's still on the right. Who is it? - Who is it? - Geneviève. I've brought the suit. It's not Fedo's but the guy before. It might be a bit big. Not even a "thank you"? Get to bed. My rent. My rent! I want my rent! That's the Frenchman's number, Philippe. There's also a Kurd, Mihyedin. Call him. Where is he? Abdullah, where is he? Sis, here's mom. My daughter. You have to be strong. Avdal... What? Is he dead? Mom, is he dead? Yes, my daughter, he's dead. How do you know? We know, my daughter. Save me! Hello? This is Siba, Avdal's fiancée. I know he's dead. I want to see him. I'd like to see him. Our women are so fine Come pick their apples Each one worth a basket of gold Come pick their apples Their breasts are ripe Sweeter than a Turkish delight My heart's sorrow weighs so heavy I've become sick with love Mihyedin? Speaking. Who's this? It's Abdullah. Abdullah who? Siba's brother. I didn't know him, but his death shook us. It's so sad. Siba is in a hotel in Paris. She's just heard about Avdal. We're worried about her. Can you help her? No problem. Just tell me where she is. I'll take care of it straightaway. Welcome, Siba. Mihyedin. My condolences. Mamat, democrat, patriot, optimist. Tajdin, brother to Mihyedin. Azad. My condolences. Akil. Welcome. Comrade Bargran. Welcome. Me won't find better. What did you say? You won't find better. You can't speak any language, neither Kurdish nor French. - You're nothing. - You're right, bro. You've always dreamed of a young, patriotic Kurdish virgin. There she is. It's the Frenchman. Good evening, Siba. Do you need anything? Food, drink? What makes you think I'm a virgin? You speak French? Is that your patriotism? Dear Siba, as a democrat, socialist, patriot and optimist, I like you a lot. I'm also a feminist. I even read a book on women's rights. In what language? Did you know Avdal? No, but you can count on me. I'm here. I'm waiting for his father. He's coming. But I can't wait. I want to see him. And I want to meet Philippe. I'll get him for you, but be warned he's a loser. I want to meet him. I'm glad you like my tangerine. Siba, some grapes? Siba's in Paris. Do you know where she is? Of course: she's here with me. I must see her. You can't. She's in shock. Avdal's father is coming. - If you need anything, call me. - Yeah, I need something. - What have you done? - It was that or a common grave. We're Muslim, we don't burn our dead. He burned the fiancé's body. What do we do? He was Kurdish. Maybe a patriot. We must give him to the father. - He's yours. - Shut up, Kurd-burner. - No, you shut up! - Give us a moment. I have to consult with my brothers. Gather round. Do we keep the ashes? Yes, we must keep them. They don't want the ashes. Democratically, of course. We said we'd keep them. We're not keeping them. Shame on us, he was a Kurd. Mihyedin. My condolences. Here they don't bury their dead as soon as possible. A body can stay in the morgue for several days. And sometimes - out of conviction - they cremate their dead. Not just leftists, rightwingers too. Mamut. It was Avdal's destiny. What? Cremation. What do you mean? They cremated your son. It was the Frenchman, not us. God is great... ENTRANCE Hello. Cheto, Philippe. My condolences. You shouldn't have burned his son. If not for me, you wouldn't have known of his death. He would have been buried in a common grave. Take that away. You shouldn't have burned his son. You shouldn't have burned my son! You were the only woman in Mihyedin's house. How dare you sleep here? Why not? They're men! But I was alone in the room. Come in. I want him with me tonight. Forgive me for yesterday. I'm broken, he was my son. Lucky for us Philippe was there. Lucky? My son is dead. He did a lot for Avdal. Don't mention him again. My son... We don't burn our dead. You must understand his father's reaction. I did what I could. I know, you did a lot. Were the two of you close? I didn't know him well. We often spoke of you. He showed me photos of you. Did you meet here? Yes, he came in to the bar. We met... at the bar. What was he doing the day he died? I'd found some work for him. He was going there. He took bus 47 to Gare du Nord. I was waiting for him at the stop... Well... Goodbye...? Goodbye, I guess. Hello. I'd like him near me tonight. May I? Thank you. Where were you? With Philippe. I forbade you to see him. What were you doing? I'm changing our flight to go home earlier. I don't want to go back. You don't want to go back earlier? I won't go back at all. You're a disgrace! You're a woman, you're our honor and my son's honor. I'm nobody's honor! If a woman's honor is here, where is a man's honor? Shame on you! What's this? Have you no shame? Give me back my money and passport. You don't need them anymore. You're not leaving this room. What gives you the right? You're not my father or my husband! You'll go back and marry Zenar. Marry? Avdal's brother? Just like that? Just like that. Abdullah, it's me. When are you coming back? Give me mom. First answer me, I'm your brother. Just give me mom, please. First answer me. Abdullah, I'm not coming back. Now put mom on. That wasn't so hard, was it? Here she is. Pain in the ass! My daughter. Mom. Cheto took my passport and money. He wants to take me back by force and marry me off to his other son. My daughter, Avdal was nice. Be careful of Cheto. He can be dangerous. He used to be a patriot, but now he's a radical Islamist. I know, don't worry. This is where I stay. Paris is full of problems. It's very complicated. Rent, noise, pollution... I don't like the 1st floor. It stinks of exhaust fumes. The 5th is between the 4th & 6th. It kind of sucks. The 6th is very noisy. The noise echoes in the courtyard. The 7th is nice, it has more light and less noise. That's why I chose it. But I'm looking for a bigger place. But not right now. Is this it? - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm good, Philippe. I'm good. I have a shower, if you want. - Hello. - Hi. Seven coffees. - We're looking for Philippe. - Haven't seen him. - Really? - No. What did he say? - What did the owner say? - Don't know. - What did the owner say? - He hasn't seen him. - Hasn't seen him? - No. He hasn't seen him. What now? Are you hungry? I don't know. What would you like to eat? Anything, even hard-boiled eggs. Hard-boiled eggs? Sure. - I have to go. - Why? - I have a meeting. - With who? I can't remember if it's one guy at eleven o'clock or 11 guys at one o'clock. Go home - now. Why are you laughing? Why is he forcing you to return? Are the lines here secure? Of course, it's France. Go ahead. I'm going to trust you, Mihyedin. Can you get me a gun? A gun? Give me the phone. Give! Mr. Cheto. You can't speak of such things on the phone in France. But you play better than me. Don't cry. Not any more. You see? Have you got the gun? Who has the piece? She ran away with my son's ashes. It's the Frenchman. He's putting ideas in her head. He's not to blame. If you contradict me again you can pack your bags. I like you, Siba. A lot. No, Philippe. We can't. A glass of wine, please. Red. Thanks. Forgive me. God is great. We have to find her. Careful, in France women matter. Here women's rights... Hello. Siba, it's me, Mihyedin. Yes? Cheto wants a word. Siba, give me back my son's ashes. Siba, may God forgive you. You trying to kill me or what? Chuck them, I'm getting cancer here. Will you pay me back? Hello. Siba, we're democrats and progressives. We want to help you, stay with us. We just want to help you. Thanks. Thanks for everything. God is great. I wish we could go back together with the ashes of my son. But you don't want to. I accept that. You and I both have a heart. For the sake of my son, stay with me tonight. We have a saying: to tell the truth takes the tongue, but to understand takes the heart. I'm leaving at dawn, then you'll be free. Thank you. Is everything OK? Are you staying for a man? No. I'm staying for me. Are you hungry? No. Siba, our people always end up doing what they don't want to. I want to speak to Siba Mizori. Hello. But what's her room number? Her room number? Stop, Siba! In the name of Allah, stop! Stop, Siba! Don't make me shoot. No. No! Shoot! No, Philippe! Don't shoot! Do it! No, Philippe. Siba, I want to tell you that... Are you crazy, Philippe? Stay, Siba. Thank you for everything. Thanks for everything. This is Avdal's money. Avdal's money? Thank you for everything! To the airport.
