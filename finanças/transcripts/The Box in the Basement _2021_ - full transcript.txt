Benjamin Franklin once said, "Lost time is never found again." "All the pain, the laughter, the love, the heartaches," "all wrapped together" "in one pile." They come together in the same bag. The same box. I'm still learning. But one thing I do know is the future is not set. Not yet at least. And as I cry, he's on looking back at me. I learn to walk with grace. And I've been jolted too far out of place. I am seeking more security. Yes, you're not listening. You don't understand. No, you're not listening. realized, I'm not the only one six feet buried deep. And now, I'm humming. Trying desperately to get back on my feet. Still, I feel it in my soul. It rains throughout my skull, my bones. Heart bleeding. My heart and soul. Heart bleeding. Rachel! You're not listening. Heart bleeding. My heart and soul. She's a teen. She's... She's almost a young adult. It doesn't matter! No one, especially our baby girl, should know anything about that sort of thing. That, that cube! It has power. But it's not bad. Who knows why Grandpa wanted her to have it? We shouldn't be hiding this. Not from Avery, not from anyone. It's too dangerous! Grandpa Flick was crazy! You know that! They say that about him, but he wasn't. Look, Rache. The box isn't dangerous. You keep saying that. You're not listening to me. You're not understanding what I'm saying. You are not listening to me. We've had this box in the basement for at least a year and a half. We shouldn't have that thing in our home, Robert. I don't care that you're brother gave it to Avery. Why did they want her to have it? What if she gets it? What then? It's... It's too tempting. We should at least tell her about it. I trust Avery to make the right decision. Here you are. Where did Mom and Dad go? They went back to the car. They're arguing again. Hate it when they argue. Yeah. Me too. What were they arguing about this time? Oh, wait. Let me guess. Whatever Grandpa's been talking about. It's been getting a little... I don't know. Weird. I mean, Grandpa Yeah. All this talk about ancient power and stupid box. It's all they ever argue about. It's so stupid. Yeah. Grandpa wanted to give it to me, but Uncle Ray wanted to give it to me and tried and Mom said no. And now it's all Mom and Dad can ever talk about. Aiden? Yeah. I'm good. Hey, what if this box can make me, you know, feel better? Yeah. I wish. That would be cool. Aiden? Aiden, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Robert. Robert, please. Okay. Okay, Rache. We'll store it. Put it in a storage somewhere. Next week, I'll find a place for it. Okay? Okay. Look at this loser. Biggest loser. Mia, let's go. I don't think we should be doing this. What? Who cares? Avery... Avery! How many times do we have to tell you How many times do we have to tell you not to wear your headphones at the table? not to wear your headphones at the table? Avery? Avery? Study! We are doing this because of these test results. Disappointing, class. Philosophy can seem hard. But remember what we talked about. Truths, meanings, and experiences. And then, resimplify them. Confucius once said that, "Success depends on previous preparation and without that preparation, there is bound to be failure." This is failure! And the truth is, we can fix it by studying. And definitely, not by paying attention to what's going on outside of the class instead of what's happening in here! Right, Avery? You really need to stop drifting off and start paying attention. This is your last warning. Understood? Yes, Mr. Murphy. Okay... Let's start with Eastern Philosophy. So, we have up here one, two, three, four, five, six, seven famous philosophers. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna have to figure out where they are from or what philosophy they represent. Blue will be west, red will be east. So, starting off with Socrates. Where was Socrates from? Greece? Greece. So, what will that make him? Greek. Greek philosopher. There you go. Where is Greece? In Europe. And is that East or West? Mm-hmm. Right. So, thinking about joining the, uh, Major Leagues? Yep! I'm gonna be the youngest player in the history of the MLB. The M-L-what? MLB, dummy. Major League Baseball? I'm not the dummy, you're the dummy. No, I'm pretty sure you are. You're cool, brother. What? Nothing. I said you're a dork. You're the dork. Aiden! Aiden? Aiden? Aiden. Aiden, Aiden, wake up! Help! Somebody? Aiden? Aiden! Aiden? Aiden, please, please, please. Somebody! Aiden? Aiden, wake up! Now, Avery, be careful. That's a new shirt. Don't spill anything on it. Okay... What did... Rachel... What... Robert! It wasn't me. You jerked the car. If you hadn't jerked the car. Why are you blaming this on me? What do you mean I'm blaming this on you? Okay, you know what? You always do this. You're turning, swerving the whole situation. I... Well... How is she supposed to drink it if I don't remove the lid? She has her own hands, doesn't she? Why are you blaming me, again? - No, I didn't. - Yes you did! No... Just drive more carefully. Okay. Let's just get out. Because this is... Hello! Hey! Hello. Hey! Hello. Hello! What's going on? Hi! Hey! Put it in there. Hey, oh, you got it, too! You stopped and got it, too! Why is life so hard? Life sucks! Life sucks. Now, Avery, honey, you have our numbers. Both our cell numbers. Uhm... Uh, there's plenty of food in the fridge and if anything happens... Rache... She'll be fine. We've... We need to get out and you know, just have some father and mother time. We've been going through a lot since your brother... And I know things hasn't been easy since we moved here. Anyway, you have our numbers. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Bye. Bye, honey. We'll be back in a while. Hello? Hey. Avery, you there? Hey, Amy. Can you, uh... Can you see me now? Uh, yeah! Yeah, I can see you now. Hey, girl. Hey! What's up? Uhm, I don't know, I mean... I'm okay, I guess. It's good to hear your voice. I miss you, though! Can't wait to come over next week! Cool. It's been, like, so long since you've come. I'll bring some games! Yeah, sounds cool. What's wrong? I mean... it just feels like everything sucks right now. My parents are arguing and the bullies in school. It's just... Parents arguing again? Yeah... I mean... It's always about some stupid box that I'm not even supposed to know about. I mean, like, duh. I've known for, like, forever. And, I don't know... Mom says it's about some dangerous power or something? I don't know... whatever. Power? Like, like from the cube? Yeah... or something like that. Anyway, I'm excited for you to come over. Yeah! I'll, I'll see you Saturday. Yeah. Uh, hey, listen. I actually got to go. Oh. Uh, yeah. Yeah, no... no problem. See yah. Bye. See yah. Bye. Welcome, young traveler. If you are embarking on this journey for the first time, know that this box is no ordinary box. It comes with a potential to give you a vision of the future and has the power to transport you to that future if you touch the box for too long. But, be warned... This power and ability also carries with it a grave warning. The power to transport you to that future in time also means you will be unable to return to the present. A power and a warning. Take heed, traveler. The choice is yours. Your future is up to you. Avery? Avery? I'm... you. The future you. I know it must be so much to take in. Seeing yourself, talking to yourself. Well, there's a reason for cutting through time. Space... ...whatever it is. A reason? Yes! A reason. I was told by a lying sage that if I ever had to return to my past and meet my younger self, that it would only bring myself some trouble. And... I remembered... I've remembered going through some very hard times. Life... Life seemed very difficult. And I also remembered not wanting things to seem the way they were. Wanting the way out. You're thinking just forgetting about your life. Transporting here. Remember? But you... ...are the one who can change your life. Not others. Future's up to you. Avery? Avery, honey, where are you? Avery, where are you? I... I have to go Uh, someone's calling me. I can't... I can't stay. I'm not even supposed to be here. Avery, you must listen to me. You can't come. If you do, you'll change the current events, you'll alter the course. Everyone and everything you ever loved... will not exist. You can't come, Avery! Avery! Avery? Avery? Avery! Avery. Avery! Avery! Avery! Avery! No! I got my grades back from my teacher. Yeah, you know? It's been kind of... Do you think they have any dairy-free options? Hmm, maybe I should try... What are you gonna get? What was that? Tacos and... I don't know why, I just, um... Hello, Avery. Avery? Ola, Avery? Hey... Hey... Hey, Robert Not Robert, it's Roberto. Roberto, Avery. Not Robert. Roberto. Alright, try. Repeat after me. Come on. Roberto. Roberto. Ro-ber-to. Roberto. Close enough. So, how's Mom and Dad? Good. I guess... Look, Avery, I don't mind letting you hang out here. I'm here for you. But, is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Really? Because I can tell a fake smile when I see one. Listen, Avery, I've had to make some hard choices before. I remember one time, this Australian guy came in to the restaurant, right? Big, buff, Australian guy. But he was really rude to his girlfriend and his friends. So, right before I took his order, he stopped me and he said, Oy, mate. Lo quero Taco Bell. And the whole table was laughing. At first, I thought it was stupid. I don't even like Taco Bell. But then I realized that he was making fun of me. Then I got mad. So, what did you do? So, right before I gave him his food, I made sure we put the hottest hot sauce in his burrito. No way. Yup. True story. He got so red that his mouth was on fire. He got up and left the restaurant. Everybody in the counter was dying. We were laughing so loud to a point that the boss came out. He pulled me aside and he told me that that guy that I just did that to? Apparently, he was the new contractor he hired to renovate the whole building. No! Mm-hmm. So, what happened after that? Well, I got a warning, but I learned a very valuable lesson that day. A lesson? A lesson. I learned that, Australian people can't really handle spicy food. But, no, seriously. I learned that my decision to hurt someone else, only hurt me in the end. Remember, Avery. You can't change people, but you can change yourself. Only you can change who you are. And your future. So, all these people that bully you in school, all the people that aren't nice to you, don't let them define who you are. Only you have the power to do that. Anyway, that's enough wisdom for one day. Same as usual? Uh, yeah. I'll have a torto sour cream and onions. "Torta", Avery. It's "torta." "Torta." There you go, that wasn't so hard. Alright. Let me go to the back and I'll put in your order. Okay. Bye, Robert. "Roberto." Uh-huh. That's what I thought. Excuse me. I didn't help but overhear. Were you talking about bullies? Uhm... Yeah? I know what you're going through. I've been there, too. Hi. I'm Cavenough. I'm Avery. Don't mind him at all, he's not shy. I was bullied, too. In first grade, the kids were calling me weird because I was doing work faster than everyone. And I didn't look like anyone in my class. I was scared to tell my mom. And shortly after, I had a hard time eating. And I didn't enjoy doing all the fun stuff that I used to love to do. Because I had a darkness inside of me and at first, I thought the bullying was my fault. But, one day, I did a brave thing and I told my mom what was going on. And she asked me how she could help and she just helped me turn that darkness into a big spark to change the entire world. And now, I go across the country, making people smile, spreading positivity, and helping other kids who are being bullied. So, don't let those bullies get to you. Whatever you believe, you can achieve. Don't ever let anybody tell you differently. And remember, you got this and you are powerful. Wow, uhm... Thank you. Thank you so much for... you know... encouraging me and all. It was so great to meet you. Any time. And I'd like to give you this coin full of positive vibes. And you can pass it on to someone else to spread more kindness in the world. I love it. Thank you so much. You're welcome Bye. Bye. Trying to follow the flow. What does it have to tell me? Is there something waiting for me? Voices in the water could know. Too many thoughts fight peace. Too many words kill dreams. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces... Walking on water! Walking on water Walking on water! Walking on water! Isn't so impossible. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces... Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Isn't so impossible. The way I'm inside is like a phoenix taking over me. I'm feeling so reborn from here. Spirit voices revealed, "Love is a place for giving, it's not a place for taking." Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces... Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Isn't so impossible. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces flow in. Every time I look in to me, 7 million faces... Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Walking on water! Isn't so impossible. Your future is up to you. Up to me? Don't worry. I got this. It's off. Hey, guys? Uhm... I, uhm... I wanted to tell you guys something. Uhm... Someone just told me that... That I can change my future based on how I look at things. And, uhm... And I think I'm gonna start doing that now. Well, Avery, we also have something we want to share with you. Uh... Your father and I, we're working things out. We've talked and renewed our commitment. To each other... ...and to you. We're gonna be fine. Okay. Let's go over it, again. Existentialism. Now, you know the father of Existentialism is Soren Kierkegaard. Now... Class, what did he say about how we have the power to change our future? Come on, class. You should know this. Alright, so... Okay. Avery? Life... Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. William Ernest Henley once said that, "I am the master of my fate." "I am the captain of my soul." Basically, we determine our future. It's up to us. Us. Very well said, Avery. Very well said. Wonderful, wonderful. Okay... So, that takes care of Soren Kierkegaard. And as Avery mentioned, William E. Henley. Next, we have here... Mia, Shailey. We need to talk. Okay... Okay? Girls... Is it true that you've been... you've been bullying other kids? You know how we feel about that kind of nonsense. We've talked about it a hundred times! I just... I just can't believe... Who was it? Who were you two bullying? Look at this loser. It was Avery, okay, Mom? I didn't mean to. Mr. Murphy told me about your grades, Shailey And that is another conversation we will have. Do you understand? Yes. And back to Avery, do you know that Mr. Murphy said that she was your only hope in passing that class? No. Girls, it's wrong. It is not who we are. We don't do that. It doesn't matter who you are; Color, race, religion? It doesn't matter. Do you hear me? Did you hear me? Yes, Ma'am. You girls better start treating others with respect. Do you understand? Yes. Mom... Yes, Mia? I'm sorry. I knew it was wrong I promise I won't do that anymore. I promise. - Me, too. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Y'all need to make it right. Whatever it takes, make things right. And another thing, go wash your hair so it can be re-braided. Yes, mom. Yes, dad. Hey, how did you know that quote in class? Yeah, that was so cool. Mr. Murphy said that I'm not doing too well in class. But if I work with you, then, you'd help me to, you know get better grades. Yeah, me too. Can you help me memorize those quotes and things? Yeah. Uh, no problem. I... I got you. Both of you. Thanks so much, Avery. See, Shailey? Told you she was cool. What do I believe in? I don't think I know anymore. Tell me there's a reason. Was there ever anything more? Have I been afraid to find what I've been looking for? It's all a state of mind. I didn't know that everything was broken by design. How beautiful. It's taken me too long to realize, it's all a state of mind. What I used to keep in... Now, I'm only letting it go. Finally, I'm seeing everything I help up too close. All it took to recognize what I've been looking for. It's all a state of mind. I didn't know that everything was broken by design. How beautiful. It's taken me too long to realize it's all a state of mind. And all it is, we create. Infinite, figure 8. Ever in, we remain. Infinite, figure 8. All it is, we create. Infinite, figure 8. Ever in, we remain. Infinite... It's all a state of mind. Nice. So, what's your next one? We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is the void of the power to forgive is the void of the power to love. There's some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. Martin Luther King. I like it. Listen, Avery... Uhm... About us being mean to you... I am very sorry about it. I... Doing that made me realize that I should treat others the way I wanted to be treated. And the way I treated you is not how I want to be treated. Yeah, Avery. You're not a loser. And... It doesn't matter your color, your race, your religion, and how smart you are, how you dress... We shouldn't have bullied you because that's not how we would want to treated. And I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I forgive you guys. And plus, you've made up. Badly. Hey, Amy! Sorry. Uhm, listen... We're on our way back home soon. We got a flat tire. No problem, Ms. Thompson. It's a bit cold, though. Should I get my mom to pick me up? Oh no, no. Tell your mom it's fine. Listen, the house key is under the clay pot next to the front door. Go inside and get out of the cold. We'll be back soon. Oh, there's food in the fridge, have whatever you want. Okay, Ms. Thompson. Oh, Avery says hi. She can't wait to see you. Okay, thanks. Mm-hmm. Buh-bye! Welcome, young traveler. Fly and see my friend. Don't know what to dream, don't know where to go. Crashers I cannot bear. Feeling so alone, trying to find my home. What do I do? Where do I go? What is my future? How to be known? God will make a change. Find a new way. Pass down the prizes, God knows, hold on thee. I can change the future, my reality. When I touched the lives of others, I'll affect my own. I am not the same. I found my way home. It's too late now to turn around and back again. I made my bed and now, I lay my head in it. I'm sorry I'm not perfect, but I knew that I wouldn't be. I guess it's for the best you know the worst in me. I'm no good at being good, and I never said I was. And I feel misunderstood, 'cause I’m trying hard to love. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me. And I'll never live it down. I'm no good at being good, and I never said I was. You call my bluff. I won't pick up, I'll let it ring. Record your voice so I can listen back again. And I'm sorry I'm not perfect, but I knew that I wouldn't be. I guess it's for the best you know the worst in me. I'm no good at being good, but I never said I was. And I feel misunderstood 'cause I’m trying hard to love. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me. And I'll never live it down. I'm no good at being good, but I never said I was. Do you wanna take me back? Our love of broken plants. So we can start again? Holding down a second chance. I'm too selfish for that. I'll let you fall again. I'll let you know that... I'm no good at being good, but I never said I was. And I feel misunderstood 'cause I'm trying hard to love. Mmmm.. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me. And I'll never live it down. I'm no good at being good, but I never said I was. Amy? Amy? Amy? Are you here? Hey. We're back. Rachel. I thought Amy came inside. Amy's backpack is right here.
