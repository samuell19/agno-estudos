Em. Em. - Get her to the sofa. - It's okay. Charlotte. Anne, find papa. Oh, it's just a bad cold. They shouldn't be too long, my love. - 'What is it, my love?' - Hmm, there's nothing. 'There is something.' 'How did you write it?' 'How did you write Weathering Heights?' I took my pen and put it to paper. There's something more. Something you're hiding from me. Why is it so hard for you to believe that your sister could write something of merit? 'It's an ugly book.' 'It's bias and ugly' 'and full of selfish people who only care for themselves.' Good. There is something. Captain Sneaky. Captain? Soldiers are waiting for your command, ma'am. Thank you, Captain. Captain. Yes, ma'am? I've been thinking of what you said, sir. And what did you think, ma'am? You are.. ...measurably important to this kingdom, sir. Thank you, ma'am. What I meant to say before is.. ...you're more important to me than anyone. And.. She's here. I'll take me leave, captain. - Charlotte. You're back. - Anne. - Father. - Welcome home. Oh, Branwell. Charlotte, my girl, we missed you. I missed you all so much. Wee congratulations, young doll. 'Yes, they want me to stay on as a teacher after I graduate.' - 'Oh, wonderful.' - 'Wonderful, Charlotte.' 'Charlotte, that's great.' 'I wouldn't expect anything less. 'I'm so proud.' 'I wish I was going.' - 'Emily's turn first.' - 'Where is that girl?' - 'Daydreaming no doubt.' - 'Em!' There she is. There's my scruff. Em, Charlotte's been offered a teaching position at the school after she graduates. Where have you been, Emily Jane? Working on my French, papa. Mm. Come and help your aunt. Your sister'll be hungry. 'Just excited to see her.' Is that you in there? - It's me. - You look different. I'm just the same. Come here. And then they traveled on the wings of the dragon and they find Captain Sneaky. Captain Sneaky? Mm. It's just for fun. I'm writing other things. We both are, Anne and I. More serious affair. What have you been writing? I haven't had time to write anything. But you must write. Are you looking forward to starting at school? - Yes. - They're all dying to meet you. Is it nice having friends outside the family? Of course. You've been working on your French, Oui? Oui. What? - You said "His bottom." - What? 'Emily.' I meant the end. The ending of it. I know you did. I think Captain Sneaky should return to battle before the dawn. No, Esmeral's waiting for him, remember? He must journey far across the desert and into the... You mustn't talk that way. - What way? - At the school.. 'You won't, will you, Emily Jane?' - It's just a story. - It'll draw attention. 'It's strange.' 'And from the wrath of the land' for the great day of His wrath hath come.. ...and who shall be able to stand? 'Amen.' Amen. 'And now, brethren' 'it's my duty to introduce to you today' 'our new curate Mr. William Weight man.' 'He's going to assist me in this great wager against sin.' 'I'd like to ask Mr. Weight man, uh' 'graduate of Oxford University no less, say a few words.' 'Thank you, Reverent Bronte, for your very kind words.' Brethren, it rained my entire journey up here. It rained and it rained and it rained and I thought.. "...Where in God's name have I landed?" 'And as it continued to rain' 'I began to think about what I might say' at my new, slightly damp congregation. And it occurred to me to talk about the rain. 'Because generally I-I do love it.' To walk in it.. ...the feel of it, the smell of it, and.. Especially, especially if you lie awake at night and listen to it. There's nothing quite like that. 'And often, when..' '...I'm listening to the rain in my bed late at night' 'I am in despair about, about something.' 'What if I was to think..' '...we, all the people of Howarth' 'at that very moment' 'are in their beds.' 'And they too are listening to the rain' 'and they too are lonely and sad and afraid.' 'And suddenly I don't feel I'm alone anymore.' God is in the rain. And God is in us. 'But how can we be alone..' '...when we're all listen to the rain together.' 'Let us pray.' What are you going to give them? There's nothing left but bread. - Did you hear him? - Yes, the Weight man. - Wasn't he... - Insufferable. Did you hear what Reverent Miller said? Meaning of life in a cup of tea. What about Weight man's? Um.. Yeah, it was alright. He speaks with such poetry. - Such truth. - Which any man can speak. What I want to know is can he actually do... 'Do what?' Ah.. An empty plate. Sorry, I don't think we've been properly introduced. Ah, Mr. William Weight man. Do any of you actually speak English? I do. 'I mean..' 'This is Emily, Anne, and Charlotte.' 'I'm Charlotte.' 'God bless you all.' Your sermon was very... 'Oh, I, was it too much?' I, uh.. Actually, I, what I thought halfway through, I, uh.. I planned to be a lot more eloquent. But, uh, when you get up there you just.. 'Nature is always an inspiration.' 'Yes, nature was wonderful.' Thank you. Thank you. Though, Jove, he's very dramatic.. '...in any way for joke.' 'The rain was a good choice.' 'Thank you.' I do wonder though. How does God squeeze himself into all that rain? Won't he get wet? - Please, the humanities? - Yes. - The poetry, painting, music. - 'Exactly... ' These are the very air that our society breathes rather than destroy us, Reverend Miller. Oh, here they are. I return home to find my poor father overrun with the entire clergy of Yorkshire 'and not a pot of tea to be seen.' And my sisters holding back the new curate in the kitchen. Branwell Bronte. How do you do, sir? William Weight man. Your brother has been accepted into the Royal Academy of Arts, girls, eh. - 'Congratulations.' - Thank you. Thank you. - 'That was wonderful.' - 'Well done.' She's asking papa if she might have a friend come stay in the spring. A friend? - Here? - From the school. Oh. Branwell at the Royal Academy of Arts. Can you believe it? Papa may not approve of a visitor. You know what he's like. And you're off to become a wonderful teacher. Yes. 'Anne, Emily, come to bed.' Coming. - Captain Sneaky's tonight, aye? - Ah.. Perhaps we should leave our stories for a while. What? Charlotte says that stories like that are for children. She needn't know. We could sneak down tonight, play it toge... No, we're not children anymore, Em. I like to play these games with you.. ...write these stories, but.. But what? Sometimes, I think you actually believe... Yes? Come on. She's waiting. Do you ever miss mother? We agreed not to talk of her, didn't we? Yes. But don't you dream of her? I don't dream at all now. A waste of good sleep. Besides.. ...we should not dwell in the past. It's the future we must live for. Hmm? I hear you're going to join your sister at the school to study, Ms. Emily. - Yes. - Well, that'd be lovely. Here you are. Thank you. Does everyone in Howarth know that I'm going to that school? Is there applied mail your friend Ellen? Yes. And this. From Mr. Weight man. One to each of us. Valentines! In French! Look, little sachet of seeds. - Rose seeds. - Is he here? Is Mr. Weight man here? He's gone over to Keith's for the afternoon. Mrs. Bateman died. Oh, how lovely. Look. - Going to Howarth. - Is that so? You know it so. That's very kind thing to say, Ms. Bronte. Well, it's the truth. 'And I always speak the truth.' I just want to stay in my bedroom until your friend Ellen goes. - For three days? - 'You know what I'm like.' Can't you see how that'll be perceived? How rude, how strange... Or you can tell her I've gone away for a few days. No, that, no, that's insane! I won't do it, Charlotte, I won't. You know I don't like to meet new people. How are you going to get on with your life if you're so... He doesn't care about you, you know. Pardon? The new curate. - Weight man. - Take that back. He's not to be trusted. He is a dear friend. You wait and see. If you give me her hand. Just, please, Mr. Weight man. - I'm sure we can manag... - Oh. Oh. - Ellen. - Breathe. Breathe, Ms. Nussey. - 'Mr. Weight man, honestly... ' - 'No, it's absolutely fine.' - 'I have it. I have it.' - 'Should I go?' If you, you step back, if you, if you step back... - Oh, gosh. - You could've used my knee. - 'I'm not so sure of it.' - 'Whoo!' No one push her. No one push her. 'Let go of her hand and then if you use my knee... ' Yes. I, I'm going to jump. I'm going to go. I'm going to.. - Well done. - Thank you. Thank you. 'What small hands you have, Ms. Nussey.' Oh, thank you, Mr. Weight man. Yeah, my mother could wear the gloves 'of a four year old girl. So they say.' - Come on. - I think it's going to rain. - 'I'll make it easy for you.' - 'Thank you.' Oh, dear. Do you think it will rain, Mr. Weight man? 'No, it should hold a while longer. Ms. Nussey.' 'Sorry.' Ellen, did have a bit of trouble getting over that wall? I'm pretty sure I just felt a drop. - Me too! - So did we! No. No. It will halt. This tree. Ladies, shelter under this tree. - This tree isn't helping. - No, it isn't. This is not working at all. 'Come on. On with it, troops.' Charge! Come on, Charlotte. All the way to battle! Sorry. Look, they don't like the rain. - The feel of it. - The sound of it. The smell of it. From now on we shall call him Ms. Celia Amelia. - I'm a fool. - No, you're not. But I'd rather be a fool than not live at all. You're an embarrassment to us. Do you know what they call you in the village? - Stop it, Charlotte. - No! They call you The Strange One. And you are. Mother would be ashamed to see who you've become. Every time I come home I see more and more of what you're becoming. I won't let you drag me down, I won't! I'm going to make something of myself. Charlotte. - Please talk... - Please... - Please talk. - Please share. - Please. - Please. Very well. - He always does that? - Does he? - Here we go. - This is a good story. Oh, no. Now, this mask which you see before you.. And you may pass it amongst yourselves if you wish. Was given to my dear deceased wife on our wedding day. But the card was never found and so we never found out who gave us such a mysterious gift. And then we discovered Aunt Branwell had bought it on a drunken summer evening... Branwell, you naughty child. It is not true. It has long been a plaything of my children, Mr. Weight man 'who pretended that it would give them magical powers' 'transforming them into all the characters' 'of Shakespeare and the Bible.' 'Although I do remember thinking at the time' 'that that may not be entirely appropriate in the eyes of God.' I'm afraid as a Christian and a clergymen I cannot condone such acts. Oh, Mr. Weight man, it's just a bit of fun. - No! - My friend, come here. No, no, no, no, no. Nothing you say, sir, shall persuade me. Nothing. D-d-do you, do you like cake? Ah. Do you like cake so much that you want everybody to eat it? Yes. Let's all eat cake! - Are you Marie Antoinette? - Oui! 'Excellent, Ms. Bronte.' Well, I say we may use up the London stage, Charlotte. Oh, I'm sure that honor belongs to you, Ellen dear. 'Should we call a close?' Well, but Emily hasn't had a turn. Oh, no. - No. - Oh, come on, Em. Last one. - Everyone else had a turn. - I don't want to. Yes, if she doesn't want to and really, she wouldn't be any good. Hmm. - Give it to me. - Do you know who... Yes, give it here. Now just wait until someone comes to you. 'Who are you?' Still me. I'm sorry. - For the love of God. - It's getting late. Can... Shh. Please. It can be anyone. A queen, pirate... She's too shy. She shouldn't be made to do it. She's not shy, she just needs some... Everybody's had a turn. Yes, everybody's had a turn, it's her... It's not for you to say, Mr. Weight man. It isn't for you to say and... 'Children.' Who are you? I cannot stay long. Where did you come from? - From the dark. - Here we go. It's so cold outside. I'm glad to be in here with you. Where did you come from? I'm afraid it will frighten you if I tell you. Why would we be afraid? Don't you know who I am? Who are you? I lived here not long ago. And I knew you all. Emily. I can see through this mask that Emily is wearing. 'I can see Charlotte.' 'And Branwell, and Anne.' You all look so lovely, my angels. Who are you? Who are you? Don't you know me, child? Mother. Mother. - Stop it, Emily. - Please, stop. Please, stop. - Please, stop. - 'Please don't be afraid.' I waited so long to see you all my children. - Mother. - What can we do, mama? 'I worry so much, my children.' We miss you so, we try to be good. - Branwell. - Mother. You hold yourself still, child. Hold yourself to the ground. Yes, mother. - Mother. - Anne. 'Dear, sweet one, you are alright.' I feel you now. Charlotte. Little mother, where are you darling child? 'I want so much for you to be... ' Mother, I try, I try to be good. And Emily.. Tell Emily that when she is lonely she wants. They're here. - Who's here? - They've come to take me back. - 'Oh, my God.' - Mama. I've come to warn you. The mask will break. The mask is not your friend, it will break you. Every night I watch you and cry that my children won't.. '...someone will wear the mask.' 'They cannot breathe! They cannot breathe!' - They're coming out. - Get the mask off! Let me see! 'Please, children, you have to let me go.' Mama! Mama! 'Mama!' Take the mask off her! Let me speak to them. - Mama. - Mama! - 'Come back.' - How dare you, Ms. Bronte? How dare you? - We love you, mama! - Come back! We love you! 'Come back.' - Please come back. - Mama! - We love you so... - 'What has happened?' What has happened? Remember to keep still, everyone. Bye-bye, love. - Thank you. - And good luck. We expect great things. 'There's something about my spirit' 'which cannot be contained within a brush.' 'The visions in my head are too vivid, too large' 'to fill a mere canvas.' 'And it is with words, papa' 'that I will truly find my vocation.' But the money? Anne will go with Charlotte to the school in the morning. Rest tomorrow we will decide how to proceed. I will do better and be better, sir. 'When I'm gone, you'll need to..' 'You must find a way to make yourself useful.' 'To papa, to the family.' 'I know it's difficult for you, this life..' '...but try not to be a burden, Emily Jane.' 'You must avoid that at all cost.' Come on. - Pardon? - Get dressed. We're going out. Breathe in all that fresh air. Have you ever felt so alive? Oh, and I nearly lost my life in a fight. A fight? I was doubled up on the ground. Somebody's foot kicking into my stomach I could feel it almost connecting with my backbone. And then, nothing. - Gosh. - Should we sit? Mm. And then I realized what I wanted to do. Like a gas light flaring up in me. And all this has opened my eyes. I mean, who was that before? Who was I? I do not know. You alright there? Yes. And what do you want to do? - Hmm? - With your life. I don't know. That's not very good, is it? - I am to write. - To write? Yes. And what do you think I should write about? What? I shall take from my own life. The ordinary. And make it extraordinary. But why? The great Shelley says that God surrounds each artist with different things. Good, bad, beautiful, and ugly. And that there's design in that. There's reason in that. I was going to be teacher. As Charlotte. I think papa would have liked that. What do you think? Pardon? What do you think yourself? I never wanted to be teacher. I just did it because I thought then papa would love me as he loves Charlotte. Is there something wrong with me, brother? Hmm? Charlotte says all the people in the village call me The Strange One. Am I strange? Everyone's strange if you look at them for long enough. No, it's just Charlotte's always right. Charlotte? What? She's the embodiment of a lie. Well, surely you must know this. Father's love, that's all she wants. So she's put away her stories and her dreams.. ...her magic. You shouldn't say that. - Why not? - Because she's our sister. We're supposed to love and cherish her. Do you think she loves and cherishes you who you really are? Do you think I could be a writer? Perhaps. You'd have to show me something first though. I have lots of stories. - Should we go back? - Mm. What's this? Hmm? Oh, yes. My creed. Don't let Aunt B see that. I don't care if she sees it or not. "Freedom in thought." Mm, yes, but you can't say it though. You have to shout it. - Freedom in thought! - What are you doing? - You try. - No, you're being silly. I'm deadly serious. Come on. No, someone might hear us. Oh, yeah. They might. Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! Try it. - Freedom in thought! - Oh, pathetic attempt. Freedom in thought! Come on, really get behind it. - Freedom in thought! - Come on. Give us some welly. Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! Emily Jane, I think Reverend Miller might have just fallen off his chair in the rectory. Good. Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! Freedom in thought! - It was... very well executed. - Executed? Mr. Weight man will be tutoring you in French. 'You will start this morning.' Thank you, father. Blindly? Hmm. There's a great deal of difference. Weight man was advertising blind faith today. - While speaking French? - Yes. - Very clever that one. - Mm. He says it's the only way to the afterlife. He's just drumming up business. Without focus on questioning sheep, what is a shepherd? 'So Jove is, is asking why he' 'an-an upright man, a good man..' And Jove accuses God of, of being, of being unjust. - 'Shh.' - 'Then afterward..' Where is he? Go and fetch him, will you, Emily Jane? I'm sure that I recognize this photo from somewhere. The snake from Garden of Eden. Oh, Emily. Save me from these wolfs. Gentlemen, may I present my sister Ms. Emily Bronte. 'I know your father well.' Sir Ralph Delaney of Delaney lodge. How do you do, young lady? Aunt says to come home for supper now. 'Mm, just come and sit with me for a minute' while I finish my drink, yeah? We are discussing the ensuing election Or should I say the rat race of humans scum. Yeah. - 'Would you miss?' - Unh. Oh, come on, Em. Here. Have some of mine first to see if you like it. 'Get the glasses, Chevy.' I wonder what they argue so much about. That's what I said. 'It is a wonder they do not chase each other' around and around and around the house. 'I'll tell you neither of them will get my vote.' 'Sir Ralph, you lie like a rug.' 'You have not voted since Julius Caesar.' 'Tonight be fair, sir. Tonight be fair.' 'I don't trust any of them.' - 'That one was promising.' - 'Lovely, Emily.' - 'Yes, well done.' - Thank you, Reverend Miller. Doesn't she play beautifully? Oh, yes. It's intoxicating. Perhaps... we should finish early today. Seems that last night's entertainment has exhausted your powers of concentration. Ms. Bronte, your brother can be unstable... Do not speak of my brother. I see that he's becoming a true friend for you. A blessing in this wasteland but I worry that to be influenced by Branwell could harm your soul. If much... If it is my soul, it is none of your business whom it spends time with. And if my home is a wasteland to you I suggest you go back to your we will not miss you. What is that? What is that? "Freedom in.." "O'thy bright eyes must answer now. "When reason with a scornful brow "is mocking at my overthrow. O'thy sweet tongue must.." Come on, it's just up ahead. Where are we going? Surprise. Branwell. 'They can't see us. Shh.' 'Sometimes I get so close, my nose is practically' squashed up against the glass. What do you think they're thinking? Hmm. The son is thinking.. "...That pudding was delicious. "When mama and papa are asleep, I shall snoop downstairs and gorge myself silly on it." And he is thinking.. "...What a handsome fellow I am. "I'm sure the cook fancies me. Why, yesterday I'm certain she winked at me." - Cook has a twitchy eye. - And a wooden leg. And her hearing will be gone. And she? She's beautiful, isn't she? Do you think she married him for his money? Perhaps she hasn't. It's alright. Oh, hell. Come on. Come on. Come on! 'Hey, there they are!' Branwell, wait. Wait. Wait. Come back here! Branwell, wait for me! Branwell! Whoo! And your brother's room. I've got some errands this afternoon. Could you put the washing on the line? Yes. Good girl. '...such large crowds gathered around it.' '...all the people..' Ms. Bronte. Miss Bronte. Are you so lost? Are you going to tell father? - Let me look at your face. - No. Let me see. Thank God, Ms. Bronte. - It's nothing. - Nothing? I'll kill him when I find him. Bran wasn't.. I stole it from him. You stole it? Tell father quickly then. It's the time he'd be spared of restless night's sheep, sleep. Oh, I'm sure you'll be guaranteed a blissful night's sleep. Go inside. Go home. Are you going to tell father? Are you going to tell.. You're late. You didn't tell my father. No. I didn't. Why not? A mystery. Should we go back? We just got here. I'll be going to bed soon anyway. I saw you with Weight man today. - What? - I saw you today. He used to be the butt of our jokes and now I see you walking out with him. You are drunk, brother. - What were you talking about? - There's nothing. Thinks himself to be an artist, the way he preaches.. ...but he's not. - You know he looks at you. - What? - What are you talking about? - Look at you. You're blushing. He thinks he has to care for my soul as to cure it, that's all. He doesn't care for it, he wants it. 'And when he realizes he can't have it' when he realizes what you really are.. ...he'll be terrified. Run. - 'There they are!' - 'Go!' - 'Go, go, go!' - 'Come back here!' Ah! Run away. Go away, my love. Go! Go!' He asked me to fetch you in. Were you there? Was it you? The problems that you arise.. Can you truly do this with his voice always in your ear? 'I cannot say, Reverend Bronte. It was dark.' 'The girl was similar but had such a..' '...wild looking or like a gypsy or a beggar.' 'You may not have any self-restraint' 'but you will show some in this house.' Was it you, girl? Were you out tonight spying into respectable houses instead of tending to your prayers because if it were you... Mr. Linton, if you will allow me to conduct the questions please. Now, daughter.. ...you will answer truthfully. Do you understand? Yes, father. Did you see Branwell last night? I saw him at supper. 'But did you see him after that?' Yes. Is it entirely necessary to subject a young inexperienced woman... I think it is, sir, and if she's as guilty as a brother there'll be consequences for her too. Where did you see him last? - 'Why does she not speak?' - 'Where did you see him?' Do not bring shame on this house, Emily Jane. 'Speak, girl.' Did you go with him.. ...Emily Jane? - 'Answer!' - I-I.. I told him I was tired. And that it was madness to go out at such a dark night and so he left me. Father, please. 'Very well, Emily Jane, you can go.' - Father, please don't hurt him. - Take her out. - Branwell, take off your shirt. - Please... I don't want her to see for God's sake. No, he, don't. He's already in pain, papa. He's hurt his leg, you don't need to hurt him more. Let go of me! Where are they taking him? He's to work for Mr. Linton to make amends. No. He's to tutor his son for amends. 'Oh, come now.' Branwell! Branwell! Branwell! - Take Emily home. - Yes, sir. Excuse me. Ms. Bronte. Ms. Bronte. Ms. Bronte, wait. Your father said I was to take you... We'll have to wait in here. I hope tonight illustrates once and for all why your brother is a dangerous influence. Because he kissed a woman? Because he kissed a married woman. 'Do you know what we sisters used to call you?' Celia Amelia. - Do you know why? - Why? Because you're like a little girl in a ribbon shop. This ribbon, no, that ribbon. You know better than him. I'm surprised you notice what I was doing at all. You spend most of your time looking at your feet. Celia Amelia? I suppose.. ...it's in my nature. To always want something new. Don't know why I should be so. Why do you always look at your feet? You hear how people talk of me? I am odd. I am an odd fish. - A fish? - Mm. If you take me away from here, I'll dry up and fade away. I see. So I am destined.. ...to be stuck here. In this backwater. 'This pond.' Oh, yeah, that's very good. Thank you. This isn't a poem, Ms. Bronte. 'Can you hear it?' What is it? It's the sea. - The sea? - Yeah. You're like these sea creatures in deep oceans. And why would you want to leave the sea? That's not what the sea sounds like. Yeah. It's beautiful. We should, we should stop! Yes, you like it. We should stop! 'Come.' 'Come in, Emily.' Now, before you speak, Emily.. ...I want you to know, I know everything. Father, I can explain. In youth, love is a confusing thing. - Love? - 'Yes.' 'It is a natural force when appropriate.' I deem this inappropriate. - Mr. Weight man is... - Mr. Weight man? - Branwell must go away. - Branwell? 'Yes. Branwell must go away to another po... ' - Another.. - 'Position.' 'Yes. I have looked into it.' He will be stationmaster at Luddenden Foot. 'I want you to write to your sisters' 'and tell them what has happened.' Yes. 'We must keep this in the family.' Dear Lord, will there ever be an end 'to the disgrace of my son?' - 'Emily!' - Branwell! You scared me. No, don't. Don't. 'There's no need to look at me?' I come back to see your face. 'But why?' In case I saw something different. What would be different? I-I would die if I saw disgust. It's just the same. 'Pa will kill you if he sees you here.' 'I came to give you this.' 'First chapter.' Well done. 'But you must be brutally honest.' Of course. - I'm sorry, I don't know why... - 'It doesn't matter.' I'm happy. But will you promise me something while I'm away? 'Of course.' 'He's not for you, my love.' - I have to go. - 'Wait.' I wanted to.. 'It's a poem.' I wrote it. - Thank you, sister. - 'To say I'm sorry.' You'll start to wonder where I am. I'm afraid. Be well, my love. Do you remember the night I wore the mask? It was just a story you were telling. Yes. Let me see your face, you idiot. Let me hold you.. Oh, beautiful. Lavender. Emily Bronte's secret ingredient. "Were we not friends from childhood?" "Have I not loved thee long?" "As long as thou the solemn night Whose silence wakes my song." "And when thy heart is resting "Beneath the church-aisle stone "I shall have time for mourning And thou for being alone." Shall I clear the plates now, aunt? Thank you, my dear. Thank you, Ms. Bronte. - Where to keep the scraps? - Yes. You can put them in that bowl. 'But if you read every tract' 'that's put in your hands by cunning' 'and designing people' 'or eagerly search out for, and pursue such tract in books' 'as you know before to be bad.' 'Then you are sure to be corrupted and misled.' 'And your talent of reading will become a source of sin' 'and misery to yourselves and others.' - 'Amen.' - 'Amen.' 'Now, if you'd please turn to page 365.' "Dear Charlotte, I hope all is well at the school and you have not caught cold with his current freeze." "I myself am doing remarkably well." "My French is improving." "And Weight man says I should be quite fluid by the spring." "Branwell is doing well at the railways and I visit him every Tuesday." "He has promised to do better and be better from now on." "I'm being brave and taking the train." "Or occasionally I walk." "I sincerely hope Anne's lessons are progressing well." "For my part, I do feel that a home education motivated by my own curiosity.." "...intellect.. "...and heart.. "...has proved to be.. ...beyond any doubt.. ...a delight." "To live and to be a fool, Charlotte." "How right you were." 'Where'd you get your ideas from?' From my sentiments. Ahem. From.. From things that happen to me. Those that occur, feelings I have. Do you ever feel it's not coming from you at all? Yes. Yes! It's, um.. It's as if I just chanced to be in the right place. And it chose me. Is that strange? No. I feel that, too. When my writing is at it's best. Do you allow me to read something? "I needed not its breathing To bring such thoughts to me "But still it whispered lowly, How dark the woods will be!" "The thick leaves in my murmur "Are rustling like a dream, And all their myriad voices "Instinct with spirit seem, I said, Go, gentle singer "Thy wooing voice is kind But do not think its music Has power to reach my mind." I'll win thee 'gainst thy will." Sister! Oh, Emily. I've come home. 'I've been invited to Brussels' to tutor young girls at Plancenoit. Uh, Monsieur Heger will be my employer. I'll further my studies in French while I'm there. 'Perhaps an idea would be to take Emily with you.' 'I mean, her French has improved markedly.' I'm happy here, father. I don't want to speak French. How dare you be so insolent, Emily Jane, you will converse. 'Well..' Sounds like she'll give you a run for your money. 'Well, think on it.' I shall have to look at the finances, of course. William! William! 'William!' Let me in, please. 'What has happened?!' 'Please!' 'Let me in! What's happened? Let me in, please!' Mr. Weight man's hosting the new family for afternoon teas. Could you make a cake, Emily Jane? And you're both expected to pass the scones and pour the tea. I'm not feeling very well, aunt. - 'Emily Jane.' - I won't do it! Emily. Do you want me to speak to your father? Emily! There you are. It's a cake. Do come in, Ms. Bronte. I don't know if it's any good. Hello. Hello. Hello. Come, sit, sister. I cannot stay long. I think I'm coming down with something. Oh, that's a pity. 'It's hard in these cooler months' 'to hold onto one's vivacity.' Yes. Yes. Vivacity is an elusive thing, Mr. Barker. Have you been well? Yes, quite well. No, I think the weather is turning. - Do you not agree, Mr. Barker? - Like one's nature. - Quite right, Ms. Bronte. - Jonathan. Do you remember what you said about your nature? No, I, um.. Ms. Bronte! 'Mr. Weight man!' Your sister isn't feeling well I'm afraid. What's happened? What has happened? We have committed a mortal sin. God will not forgive me for what I've done. But I must make amends, now you you'll stay away from me, from now on, do you hear? I don't understand. I will call your father now if you do not leave at once. No! - That night you wore the mask.. - Pardon? The night when I was first here, you wore the mask. - We were playing the game. - Yes. And you.. We.. We.. Did you...? Did I what? Did I what?! - No, sorry! - No! Now I think there's something ungodly in you.. ...in your writing. In your poetry, I.. ...I feel it when we're together. - Listen, I.. - That's not true. I have stand in here. I'm-I'm respected over here. I, uh, I have worked to do. If you don't obey my wishes I will tell your father all that you've done. All of it. Do you understand me? Please, don't do that! - Go. - Please! - Ple.. - Go! Go! You look tired. It's very busy at the parsonage. I haven't heard from Anne. Charlotte's got a teaching position in Brussels. Bully for her. - Father and Aunt B. - 'Fine.' 'How's Weight man?' He's well. - Did you get my second chapter? - Yes. 'What did you think of it?' What did you think of it? Honestly? Well, it's.. It's the most self important overwritten piece of writing. And, lazy. I've never read such lazy writing. - Pardon? - It's unclear. I couldn't understand what was going on half the time. And the thing that really upsets me is that you obviously don't have any perspective on what a truly terrible, terrible writer you are. 'Honestly, it's laughable.' 'Your characters wander about aimlessly.' Soppy descriptions of hills and mountains. And your lead characters have about as much depth as one of your sketches, which is so obviously stolen from Byron. And it seemed as difficult for you to avoid a cliche as it is for you to avoid a drink. And that's saying something, because you sit here off your head most of the time on what is it this week, opium? Gin? Rum, is it rum? You sit here in this hole at your little desk with your little bed all hopeful and perfect about the future and all the lovely things that will happen to you! It's pathetic! I don't know how you get through the day. Please. 'Oh, that's right. We know, don't we?' I have to go. I hope you fall in love someday. So I can be like you? 'So you can bleed, like the rest of us.' I'll never be like you. You are me. Mystic as well as a psychic now? You seem a little 'over qualified for your current employment.' Let's not fight. I'm-I'm so glad that you've come. - I have to go. - But y-you just got here. - This is from father. Money! - No, No, I... - No, no. I don't want... - Take it. You'll need something to buy whatever it is you need now. Yes, of course. Thank you. Em, did you really think that about my writing? I-is it.. Well, thank you. Alright, I will, I will try and do better from now on. I'll, uh.. Alright? Really will. Shall we begin? Turn to page 71. There's a French verb tense for past participle negative. - We haven't covered yet. - Hmm. Yes, it's quite tricky, isn't it? - Come. - Papa. 'What is it, child?' Emily's decided to travel with me to Brussels. Are you sure, Emily Jane? - Yes, papa. - 'Very well.' 'So you're all prepared?' - 'Yes.' - 'Good, good.' - 'Goodnight, papa.' - 'Goodnight, child.' - 'Goodnight, Aunt Branwell.' - 'Goodnight, Emily.' Ms. Bronte. 'Good evening.' It's very exciting news about-about Brussels. Are-are you looking forward to it? Yes, thank you, I am. Perhaps, perhaps you will find some inspiration there for-for your writing. Oh, I do not write anymore. I'm to be a teacher. Ah.. What? Goodnight, curate. But maybe if.. You-you must write, eh, Ms. Bronte. I'm very tired, Mr. Weight man. Yes, uh, apologies. Um.. I-I shall see you at-at the morning tea tomorrow. I have to pack in the morning. Yes, of-of course. Goodnight. Goodnight. So who decided to bring the plums? They are actually from the garden. Really? Oh! Shouldn't you be heading off now, brother? It's the long walk back. 'Pa said I could stay the night.' See you two off in the morning. 'You're staying to see us off?' - That's very kind. - Yeah. You're here. I'm sorry for the things I said that day. My mind wasn't right. It was the truth though. I'm not a writer. 'Read your poem, by the way.' It's brilliant. Perhaps the most beautiful thing I've ever read. 'Where's it?' Here it is. Keep it in my pocket so I can read it sometimes. "Emily.." "...my dear beloved." "My beloved. You need to go to Brussels" "to delay the most terrifying.." What is it? "My Emily.." Nothing. "My love." "Come back to me." There's only one true happiness in this life. To love and be loved. I read that recently. Very true. He didn't sleep in his bed all night, curate. Reverend Bronte is in his study if you want to speak to him. No, no, no. I'm sure I can find him. Thank you. I've not seen him this morning, curate. Thank you. Morning, uh, have you seen, uh, Branwell Bronte? Branwell! Branwell! Branwe... 'You ready, sister?' Yes. Have courage. Where's Branwell? Have you seen him? She said no. She said, "Tell him to leave me be." Emily! What is it? From papa. "But it is with great sadness.. "...I write that our dear curate "William Weight man.. "Our dear curate William Weight man "lost his fight with this terrible cholera and passed away last night." "He was stoic to the end." "And asked in his last few moments '"if I would pass on to my daughters in Brussels' 'his deepest regard."' 'Oh, dear!' 'It seems that our grandmother's unwell now too.' 'We will have to go back.' I was there at the end. 'You know what he said when he died?' His last words. Neither do I. I stepped out for a smoke. Just for a minute.. ...came back. Gone. Em! Did you write these? These poems, they're so.. Emily! Emily! - Someone should see these. - No! The end! You deserve for someone to see. Someone did! Someone did see them! You! 'He's asking for you again.' More opium. - It's not time yet. - 'Give it to me!' Em, come here. Emily, look at you. Why did you not write? I love you, Em. 'I did it because I love you.' Did what? Em! Branwell! Couldn't get him to lie down. He asked that I should give you this. "Dear Emily. I'm giving this letter to Branwell "in hope that he may persuade you not to go to Brussels tomorrow morning." "To delay." "My dear beloved, the last time we spoke you told me that you'd no longer write." "And the most terrible feeling came upon me." "As if I was lying already in the earth." "I know now there is only one true happiness in this life, to love and be loved." I see you finished it then. Next week we go to London to meet with Emily's publisher. Quite important meeting. Well.. Thank you all for coming.. ...to share with us our Emily's wonderful achievement. 'To think that someone from our family' 'someone from our humble little parish' 'that their story would be read in London tonight 'by some of the most prominent minds' 'well, it does give pause.' To my daughter Emily 'of whom I have never been more proud.' 'To Emily.' 'To Emily.' 'I have often struggled to understand you..' '...Emily Jane.' 'But now I see that there is so much of your mother in you.' It's my dearest wish that Emily's mother would have been here tonight to see this. Ah! Charlotte! He'll be here soon. 'To live and to be a fool.' You said that to me once, didn't you? That's how I wrote my story. I loved him, you know. Who? Silly old pea, Liam. 'Walked home with him in the rain.' The music was in my ears. Oh, it was so full. Will you do something for me, my love? The chest under our bed. What is it? 'Do you promise me?' Of course. Hurry, papa! 'Charlotte!' 'Had to go!' Do you remember when we were little.. '...how you would tell me stories?' I used to love listening to your stories. You did? Where did they come from?
