[Noble] Never in my life did I think I would kill a man. [gunshot] Couldn't imagine ever being that mad. But after everything he did... I wish I could wake him up and kill his ass again.

And the only thing between them living and dying is money. Hmm? Hmm? Tell me, can you imagine the burden... of trying to save a community... that for generations has been systematically disenfranchised, beaten down, used and abused? Some of them so, so undereducated that they can't even read or write enough to get a job. Hmm? Do they deserve to die? Do they not deserve to have a good life? A decent life?
