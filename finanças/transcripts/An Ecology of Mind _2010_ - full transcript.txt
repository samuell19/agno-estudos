If you happen to wear a white lab coat or have an office with a nice couch, we could have a very long talk about how my father, scientist, anthropologist, psychologist, cyberneticist, has affected my approach to life But that may or may not be interesting So I'd like to look at the question from another angle I have his forehead and his long legs In keeping with the genetic similarities I Inherited from him, I'm Inviting you to do the thing he did best, which Is to look at the thing, be It an earthworm, a number sequence, a tree, a formal definition of addiction, anything at all, from another angle The thing was never the thing The map was not the territory And whatever It was, It could be turned slightly and re-examined, seemingly Infinitely Like a Rubik's Cube, only one In which there might be several right answers and patterns, he would twist one bit and re-evaluate the rules from there, and then again, to be sure he didn't get stuck down a singular line of thinking This Is a film about how Gregory Bateson thought He was always learning. From everyone and everything around him. From the dog. from the fish tank. from the scientists who came to visit. from poetry. from artwork. from me. And. as a child. I learned from him. that learning never stops. It is more than fashionable. it is inculcated by our great universities who believe there is such a thing as psychology which differs from sociology. and such a thing as anthropology which differs from both. and such a thing as aesthetics or art criticism which is different from both. all three. all four. whatever. And that the world is made of separable items of knowledge. in which. if you were a student. you could be examined by a series of disconnected questions. called true or false quizzes. quiz-bits. as you might say. And the first point I want to get over to you is that the world is not like that at all. Or. let us be more polite: The world in which I live is not like that at all. And as to you. it's your business to live in whatever world you want to. Gregory Bateson challenged us to rethink or to stand back and try to perceive in a different way. To see how reality is operating. How does biology work? How do we work? How does even our own thinking get determined by larger ideas? When finally one of his ideas went "kathunk" and fell into place. the waves. like a tale-flopping whale. were enormous and just echoed out into all these different disciplines. So his inspirational quality was really quite extraordinary. That he worked in so many disciplines is a consequence of his way of thinking. He was not interested in specializing in a narrow field: he was interested in larger patterns. He was interested in how things are connected. And especially. how living things are connected. From biology at the beginning. into anthropology. into systems of ideas. pathologies of systems of ideas. and then to systems of ideas which are how we all try to live together. And "we all" includes the animals and the plants. as well as you and me. Looking at just how reality unfolds and how it all works. And when you take a little piece of it. then you just look at that little piece and you come up with a lot of erroneous interpretations of what's going on. I've always thought that way. The relation between me and that book or the book and the table is still a microcosm of the relationship between man and God or God and the Devil or what have you. That the big and the small relations are all the same thing. For study purposes you have to work with small ones sometimes. And then people blame you for working with small ones. Then you work with big ones. and they blame you for being a mystic. It's all the same business. It was as though he could zoom in on the very intimate and personal dynamics of a single conversation. And zoom out and be able to hold in focus a much larger context. As a child, I used to sit on the floor next to him, drawing pictures and listening while he gave lectures Even then It seemed to me that he was peering through a trap door at the Inner workings of life Krishnamurti said something like "You might think, you're thinking your own thoughts You're not You're thinking your cultureâ€™s thoughts" And Gregory said What does It even mean to change the way we think? I guess I've been reading too much Alice [in Wonderland]. You remember when they come out from swimming in Alice's tears. she and all the animals? She tries to dry them by reading them history. which she thinks is the driest material she can produce. And she reaches the sentence: "The archbishop found it advisable". The duck said: "Found what advisable"? "It." said Alice. "It. to me." said the duck. "is usually a frog or a worm". Gregory observed. as we have by now: that human beings behave in ways that are destructive of natural ecological systems. And he asked the question: "What is there about our way of perceiving that makes us not see the delicate interdependencies in an ecological system that give it its integrity"? We don't see them. and therefore we break them. The story basically was in the late 15th century. Some busy entomologist was looking around in the very high beams over the high hall at New College. Oxford. and noticed that something needed to be done. The big question was where to find oak timbers 40 feet long. two feet by two feet anywhere in modern England. It turned out that in the college lands there were some very large oak trees. It was reported there was a forester who came and said: "We was wondering when you'd be asking. We kept those trees for the oak beams of the College because beams do wear out after a few hundred years and we wanted to have some new ones on hand". And Gregory said: "That's the way to run a culture". What Is Important Is how he approached everything How does It work? What works with It? What are Its relationships? How does It Interact? How does It learn? And, of course, how does It think? Poring through his work I'm continually reminded at each step that an ecology of mind Is a slippery and rigorous friend You have probably been taught that you have five fingers. That is on the whole incorrect. That is the way language subdivides things into things. Probably the biological truth is that in the growth of this thing in your embryology. which you scarcely remember. what was important was not "five." but four relations between pairs of fingers. We're always in relation to something. And that being in relation was a real critical aspect of Gregory's thought. One of my favorite examples is actually to pick a molecule in the body. As it's much simpler than a thought. Something like the blood molecule hemoglobin. We could know everything about the atoms that make up hemoglobin. even where they came from in the formation of the universe. We could know the structure of it. know it's interactions with all kinds of other substances in the world. To know everything we could about the physics and chemistry and history of the hemoglobin in terms of where the atoms and molecules came from. we would still not know the essential thing. We would not know that it's in relationship to oxygen and in relationship to the way oxygen helps bodies process energy. It's in that kind of funny sense about oxygen and about life and about metabolism. getting energy. What's surprising about it is that probably we could go to another planet in the galaxy somewhere. where we found life-like animal life that used oxygen because it's such a wonderful source of energy. it's such a powerfully bonding atom. And probably something like hemoglobin would be flowing through their veins. But it would be nothing like hemoglobin in any of its details. Probably not even a protein that we would recognize. But it would do the same thing. The function of hemoglobin is what we're talking about when we say that. The function of hemoglobin is not what it is. but it's what it's in relationship to. You live in a world that's only made of relationships. When you think you can talk about the table. and you say it's hard. all you are saying is that in a conflict. in a confrontation between the table and your hand. your hand had to stop moving at a certain point. the table won. If the table were soft. your hand would have won. But you're talking about something between the two of them. I once spent hundreds of hours looking at a film of a family therapy session. There was a mother and a father and the child who was the identified patient and the psychotherapist. And that child was of bizarre behavior. disruptive. And I thought: That child is making his parents miserable. What an awful thing! And then after I'd watched it another hundred times. I thought: It's that mother that's making the child behave that way. Another hundred times and I thought: That father is sitting there. you think he's not doing anything. he is the one causing all the trouble. Then eventually I thought. you know. l think it might be the psychotherapist. The point being that the pathology was not in the child or the mother or the father or the therapist. it was in the system. It was in the pattern of the relationship between them. And I was trying to attach it to an individual. which is the way we are trained to think about causation. What happens is that when you breach a holistic structure. and you say ... or do it without saying it. when you say: I am only going to attend to this end of the relationship. I am going to study the role of the doctor. R-O-L-E. Now. a role is a half-assed relationship. you know. It's one end of a relationship. And you cannot study one end of a relationship and make any sense. What you will make is disaster. HIs father, WillIam Bateson, was a bIoIogIst and a geneticIst And In fact, WillIam Bateson coIned the term "genetics" He was a formidabIe Intellect and was, as Gregory put It, ready for the Ideas of the 20th century In the eIghteen hundreds He read Blake and Shakespeare to his boys at the breakfast tabIe and sought through his piants and his studIes for the genIus of nature It may be surprIsing that the heavy doses of scIence the Bateson's took on were Inspired by the arts They saw the arts as extensIons of the masterpiece that nature Is He studied life wherever he could. whether it was the play of dolphins or the dance ceremonies of a Balinese tribe. or the growth of a shell or a crab. whether it was the behavior of an alcoholic or schizophrenic. All those fields interested him a lot because they are various manifestations of life that he studied. ln 1524 I was in Galapagos. and failed almost completely to find out what a zoologist would do in the field. I was clear l didn't want to live in a lab. I was clear that I didn't know what field zoology meant. and nobody else did. I looked around and in a year and a half I was on my way to New Guinea as an anthropologist. There was no training you could give. no anthropology to train anybody in then. In New GuInea Gregory met renowned anthropoIogIst Margaret Mead We began to get an idea. "We" was then me and Margaret Mead. were were married. We began to get an idea of. I suppose. the affective systems. The emotional systems of a culture. What's now I think called "value systems". It was pioneering work in several ways. During that field trip to Bali and New Guinea. Gregory was the one taking the photographs. And he took photographs and he took movies. Always in the past. for instance when Margaret went to Samoa. she took a brownie box camera and she probably took 50 photographs. When Margaret and Gregory went to the field they really wanted to document behavior in a brand new way. Gregory took 50.000 photographs. During WorId War II, the OSS, the precursor to the CIA, engaged Gregory to use his knowiedge of patterns and cuIture to manIpuIate Intercepted messages and dIsrupt communIcatIon within the AxIs Powers They used his abillties antIthetically to everything he-d worked toward, and It broke his heart It was not untll after the war that Gregory was revived by the remarkabIe events of the Macy Conferences, where a whoIe new kInd of conversatIon between scIentIsts and artIsts occurred And cybernetics was born He is one of the founders of this whole school of systems thinking. together with Norbert Wiener and Margaret Mead and John von Neumann and a lot of other scientists. It was delightful. Because there was a sense of a bunch of personalities who had a new tool in common. And they were coming from all sorts of disciplines. One of the great attractions was that here the interdisciplinary approach really was real and really paid off. How could you imagine them in the same room having a conversation? I think probably a lot of arguments. What came of that group was the trunk of the tree that became computers and the internet and everything else. Cybernetics was a science developed to describe processes taking place in complex systems. lnteractions. Organization. Communication. Control. What's happening? How are the different parts of a system connecting to each other? And it is partly the realization that you have a system. and when you poke it here. instead of something happening there. it happens that way. Or in some barely recognizable dimension. That's because it's a very complex system. which has feedbacks and all these things in it. But the complexity is going to continually baffle you. until you just really engage with cybernetic understanding. Gregory's thought process can take a moment to become accustomed to Your eyes have to adjust to the alignment he maIntaIned In which the context of the naturaI worId Is pulled outwards, so that Its Inhabitants, IncIuding creatures, oceans, forests and urban Infrastructures, are like musIcIans In a jazz group, Improvising together I've been bothered a little bit the last few days by people who say. what do you mean. "Ecology of Mind"? And approximately what I mean is that the various sorts of stuff that goes on in one's head and in one's behavior and dealing with other people and walking up and down mountains. getting sick. getting well and all that. that all that stuff interlocks and. in fact. constitutes a network. And you've got the sort of complicated. living. partly struggling. partly cooperating tangle that you'll find on the side of any of these mountains with the trees and various plants and animals that live there. in fact an ecology. Ideas are adjusting to each other, to stImull from the outsIde and InfinIte other messages Gregory's concept of mind was that It Is much more than the braIn In your head It's the tree root that grows around a rock, or the way rIver otters piay The notion that an animal. really. should be thought of as a tangle of ideas. which have to live together in him. more or less. an evolutionary principal which is then the evolution of ideas. not the evolution of animals. Where the units of evolution are essentially ideas. Where anatomy is a body of ideas. Where the bilateral symmetry. the two sides of a body. is an idea on which other ideas have to be built. For example. that the horse and the tundra. the grassy plains. are interlocked. It's an evolution in which the grass needs the horse as much as the horse needs the grass. And if you want grass. if you want what's called a "lawn" in the suburbs. you will first of all go and buy a mower. which will be the teeth of the horse. to cut that grass with. You will then go and you'll buy a roller. And the roller crushes the grass down and makes it make turf. And finally you will end up going and buying a sack of manure. because you have to be at least the other half of the horse. too. He hoped to Ieave a bIg framework Into which the specIalists could piace theIr findings, to be examined within the context of the mass tangIe of InterreIatIonships, that each tree, each person, each system In our worId embodIes Context was the key Epistemology. a million-dollar word. Most people treat it as how we know what we know. a study of how knowledge comes to be. how it's produced in our brains. how we acquire it. what kind of a thing it is. And it's probably best understood as "in contrast to how things just are". Knowledge about things is not a thing. Gregory was quite clear about that. He naturally asked himself: What is it to know? How do we know? And so he got into epistemology. And he saw it as a part of natural science. part of biology or natural history. He didn't see it as an abstract. philosophical field. I would like you to assume that that's been drawn more carefully. that these angles are what they should be and those are what they should be. And I want you to think for a moment. how you will describe that to some other person. First of all. there is a small minority who say. it looks like a boot. These are the analogic picture-thinkers. But of course there isn't any boot. and to describe the boot it looks like would be as laborious as to say. it looks like a boot. Then there are the people who break it into parts. And they will say. it's a hexagon. But it isn't a hexagon. And a rectangle which isn't a rectangle. And by describing what it nearly is but isn't quite. they get a sort of description out. And the division. of course. into parts is purely arbitrary. They could have sliced it any way they wanted. And of course it would be interesting if they had sliced it like that. But inconvenient. And the point I'm getting at is that the division of things into parts tends to be a device of convenience. And that's all. Gregory liked to quote Blake in saying: "Wise men see outlines. and therefore they draw them". And when he takes the chalk and draws the line across what I see as a boot. he illustrates for us the arbitrariness of the kind of separations that are created by defining things. So that when we define something as separate from something else. we create limits to our ability to see the interrelationships and their dynamics. So that is why Gregory also liked to quote Blake in saying: "Madmen see outlines. and therefore they draw them". And then there are the people who are the real scientists. And they see ... l didn't draw this one very well ... that there is an imaginary line. which if it were drawn properly. defines various limits. These are the scientists. They look for a relation. which isn't really there. in terms of which they will describe this thing. Now what's reality? These people are not in disagreement about the figure. Nobody ever mentions that it's a figure done in chalk on a blackboard. That it's made of this funny white stuff. I've never had one mention that. I think only a psychotic would do that. They're the ones who say the ink blot looks like a blot of ink. This is very sick. On the whole. we can get a certain amount of agreement about what's really there. But we cannot get an agreement about ways of describing it. And we use in the description a whole mass of concepts of intervening variables and mentionables to get our stuff across. We have been traIned to think In ways we hardly notice ReligIon, educatIon and cuIture all filter and frame our perceptIon If I'm of the belief. For instance. that there really is some object. that there really is objectivity. That actually would mean that that coffee cup on the table is being rendered identically in your head as mine. And we know now. even with FMRls. that this is just not the case. For us to believe it's really the same thing and for us to argue is pointless. It's absolutely pointless. The way you make sense of that coffee cup and the way I make sense of that coffee cup is different. But it's still a coffee cup. And I think that we'd have a little more peaceful earth if we had that perspective that I would respect the fact. that you have a different sense-making of that coffee cup than mine. In fact. I would want to learn about it. And we'd do that through conversation. He often used the "dIfference that makes a dIfference" The dIfference that makes a dIfference Is a way In which to define something In terms of Its reIatIonships using contrast and context, Instead of IsoIating It with a name The difference between this and this is not. of course. in this. It's not in that. It's not in the space between them. I can't pinch it. And where is it? And the difference in this and this is not moved when I move this one. If the world is made of relationships. how can we describe one thing from another? And that was a question Gregory was focusing on. And why he used the "difference that makes a difference" as a way of describing contrast and creating a process of defining the relationships between things. It's a tool that leads us to look for things in a different way. Instead of looking at the substance of it. looking at the parts and saying: What made this part? What made that part? And where did the design plan come from that makes those parts work together? One sees in the pattern of their similarities and differences a whole separate kind of patterning process. And I think that was characteristic of his way of looking through the surface to some deeper dimension. Gregory Bateson's ideas in his articles in different areas are giving clues to how to take the elevator up one flight and get on a meta-level where you get enormous leverage in your understanding. Mathematics is one method and other social patterns are another. And just the ability to recognize the same pattern when you see it in two different contexts. Even the Ianguage we speak pushes our minds Into particuIar ways of IdentIfying and defining our worId Adjusting our Iens In order to see what might be hoIding systems together Is a radIcaI step toward threading the worId back together from the InsIde The question what the ideas are that govern how we think about the world. That those ideas. again. become linked up with how we live in the world. what sort of damage we do to it. what sort of pollution. exploitation. etcetera. we engage in. Gregory and his colleagues coIned the term "doubIe bInd" The doubIe bInd descrIbes a pattern that-s like a Catch 22, an experIence In which there seems no soIutIon for escape The story Gregory used sometImes to expiaIn the doubIe bInd was about the gnat In "Through the Looking GIass" And the gnat is a still. small voice. explaining the insects of " Through the Looking Glass Land" to Alice: "We don't have butterflies. we have bread-and-butterflies". And the bread-and-butterfly has wings of very thin slices of bread and butter and the head made of a lump of sugar. Alice says: "What does it live on"? The gnat says: "Weak tea with cream in it". Alice saw a difficulty. So she said: "What happens if he can't find any"? The gnat says: "lt dies". Alice says: "That must happen rather often". The gnat says: "lt always happens". The double bind in which the bread-and-butterfly finds himself. namely that if he gets his food. his head dissolves in it. so his only hope for survival is not to find any food. but then he starves. And this is a formal double-bind of the simplest kind. l was told that ulcers were things that you got when you worried. So immediately. l was kind of a weird guy as a kid. I thought: Oh. my god. what the heck will I do if I start to worry about ulcers? We are in a double bind in the sense that we have growing inequality. The answer by the political leadership is to grow economy faster. But as we grow the economy faster. it seems to exacerbate the inequality. and it's also having tremendous impacts on global climate and on the environment. So the answer is more. And yet. clearly. there needs to be some qualitative shift. And in order to see that it's time for a qualitative shift. it would take an extraordinary vision and imagination. because slowing the economy creates unemployment. pain. suffering and political backlash. The double bind is a creative imperative. It's the moment when. because this and that doesn't work something else is going to have to be improvised A creative impulse is necessary at that moment to get out of the situation. to take it up a level. Can we see a bIgger picture? Can we think about the way that we think? Can we see the probIems of linear thinking In a worId made up of cIrcIes? EInsteIn saId "No probIem can be soIved from the same IeveI of conscIousness that created It" My dad asked He often talked about this. And he never answered it. It became sort of the big Bateson puzzle. If you look at those things he mentions. the crab. the lobster. the orchid. the primrose and two human beings: What do they have in common? Obviously. they are living beings. What is the pattern of organization that is common to all living beings? He might say. looking beyond the surface and looking for the principles behind something. that becomes. I think. the general description of much of what he does when he looks at nature. He recognizes that by looking at the patterns. at the regularities in nature. the redundancies. the similarities of things. but recognizing that it's always theme with variation. The combination of theme and variation immediately points you to something behind it. a formative principle. He was often accused of taIking In rIddIes and never coming to the poInt HIs questIon about the connecting pattern was never meant to be answered, because the patterns are changing It was the act of questIoning that he was pushing for, knowing that the eyes behind that curIosIty will be the most apt to gIve the patterns of connectIon room to wiggIe as they perpetually seIf-correct, and to see the beauty In that process When you see process. you see constant change. That's why Gregory was constantly quoting Heraclitus. Heraclitus. the Greek philosopher. said: "No man can step into the same river twice". Because it's flowing. And by this same token. maybe you can't kiss the same person twice. You can't pick up the same baby twice. Growing up In CalifornIa, I Iearned that In an earthquake the kInd of structures that Iast are the ones that have enough flexIbillty to allow for the ground to shift That was the same soft of architecture that Gregory trIed to deveIop In his students- thinking skills Those moments of being able to say. l used to think it was like this. but now I think it might be like this. that was a way of saying: l learned something. So there wasn't any sort of concrete value placed on the stability of an opinion ln fact. it was just the opposite. It's like an acrobat. He's walking on a high wire. and he's got a balancing stick. Whenever he feels himself fall over that way. he does this with his balancing stick. pushing this side down. raising this side. and thereby gets a little bit of torsion in his own body to balance himself. to not go over that side. If he overdoes it. He'll have to do the reverse. but he may wobble. He may. as they say. oscillate. like any other self-corrective system. A machine with a governor or so. But what he's essentially doing is using the changeability of his relationship to the balancing pole to preserve a basic proposition: I am on the high wire. Change may be scary, but not changing Is even scarIer Our abillty to remaIn stabIe Is IronIcally a measure of our flexIbillty Not allowing change Is the perfect formuIa for becoming obsoIete The world in which you've been placed is rather a strange world. because it doesn't contain anything. It only contains news. Reports of difference. reports of change. preferences for change. preferences for stability. Etcetera. etcetera. etcetera. But really no high wire. no balancing pole. only states of a balancing pole. states of you on a high wire. From the moment when I saw that the word "stable" refers not to the cat. not to me. not to the object. when I say: "lt is stable." the moment I discovered that "it" was an error. I was living in a world of ideas. Very important ideas. or elegant ideas. To live in a world of ideas is to be alive. So. here we are. floating in a world which consists of nothing but change. Because if there isn't any change. there isn't any knowledge that there isn't. Only by the creation of change can I perceive something. And in this world we float. we talk. and we talk as if there were a static element in the world. Change Is happening with or without our noticing It We live on a ball, swirling with systems within systems that are Interacting all the tIme Any attempt to Iock down eIements of that process Is an abstractIon and causes ImbaIance LIke the tIght rope waIker, If he were to tie down a limb We talked about Goethe's thing about the leaf. the stem. and the bud. how the stem is defined by having leaves which have stems in its angles. and so on. Now. that stuff. for me. is really very right-brain-ish sort of stuff. And if I go for a walk in the woods. stuff like that is what I enjoy as I walk along. Any kind of aesthetic response is a response to relationships. When you read a poem. the rhythm is the relationship between the words. The different vowels echo each other. The images match up in various ways with images in your own head. So the experience you take from the reading of a poem. or looking at a painting. is an unconscious exploration of the many different relationships that the artist has managed to capture. One of the things that I think is most amazing about being a human being is that we can get inside of each other's heads. that we can share stories. that we can live parts of each other's lives vicariously. If you've been in a society for any time and in communication with people. you are really entwined in a web so deeply with other people's stories that it must be very hard to tell ourselves apart from that. The story is of a man who asked his computer: "Do you compute that you will ever think like a human being"? The Computer worked on the question and finally printed the answer. And the piece of paper had on it printed: "That reminds me of a story". Gregory was very much interested in how the kind of relationships developed and structured human personalities and societies. The reverse of that. however. we find in torture. in humiliation. in oppression. It's link to ugliness is straightforward also. It's destroying relationship. It's using relationship to undermine other relationships. That's ugly. One of the interesting things that happens is if you look at your hand and consider it not as some bananas on the end of a sort of a flexible stick. but as a nest of relations. you will find that the object looks much prettier than you thought it looked. This means that with a correction of our epistemology. you might find the world a great deal more beautiful than you thought it was. No only that. but you wouldn't be able to collect things. The whole problem of possession begins to look totally different. lt's easy to collect multiples of bananas. You can stack them in various ways and so on and so on. count them. tell your neighbors now many you've got and so on. But the same relations. l don't know how many relations go to make this rather elegant object here. and relations between relations and relations between relations ... ExpressIon through the arts was consIdered by Gregory to be the most honest and pure form of human communIcatIon It's easy to forget that when we find meaning In a story or enjoy the beauty of a piece of musIc, we're engaging In the reaIm of thinking that Is most In sync with nature Metaphor Is the Ianguage of reIatIonships, the Ianguage of naturaI systems, In which there's room to communIcate In spectrums of possIbillty Instead of tightly defined cul-de-sacs He thought from such a big place. His mind was big. But his heart was as big as his mind. So you put those two together. that's what was so exciting about living with Gregory. I'm endlessly fighting a battle with people who want to throw the intellect out and think of nothing but the heart. When you fight that battle. you sound like an intellectual. When I meet intellectuals. I am fighting the opposite battle. The perceptIon of separatIon of me from you, of us from the redwoods, of the redwoods from the AfrIcan deserts Is an illusIon I wonder what Is the opposIte of the pattern which connects Aren-t the lines we draw, the spiItting and the dIviding, ImagInary anyway? T S Eliot saId "A condItIon of compiete simpiIcIty, costing not Iess than everything and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well" Over here there's humanity and everything it does and then over here is the other living stuff. climate and such things. And the idea of those being conceptually. operationally. theoretically. scientifically separate is just nuts. lt just asks for some of the kinds of problems we've got. To believe that there is such a division and the belief in such a division does affect our conduct in all sorts of ways. It affects our entire ethical system. it affects our whole notion of what is healthy. what is sick. what is a crime. the whole McNaughton rule and all that. all hinges around what I believe to be a nonsense dichotomy and one which the sooner we get all the way away from. so that we don't have it lurking around in our vocabulary or anywhere else. the sooner we shall be happy. Or a little happier. Blake said "If a fooI shouId persIst In his foIIy, he would become wise" Are we there yet? What-s on the other sIde of the garden door Is totaI obsoIescence and freedom, and maybe another sort of democracy It-s ChrIstIan, It-s Buddhist, Muslim, Pagan It-s Jewish and radIcaI and conservatIve It-s totally punk rock It-s authentic, and It questIons authorIty QuestIons It till It bIeeds with the authenticIty of the unseparated What are the premises that we want to maintain? What are fundamental and essential parts of our ways of living. of our lives. of our perception that we wish to keep intact and that we're willing to use our thresholds of flexibility to maintain? What are we willing to adjust. and what do we want to keep as essential? The nature of the world in which I live. and in which I wish you lived. all of you and all the time. but even I don't live in it all the time. There are times when I catch myself believing that there is such a thing as "something" which is separate from "something else". Gregory taught me that to be compiete, really compiete, IncompietIon must be IncIuded Into the system It-s Iearning to Iearn Anything else Is just static, not evoIving, finIshed I eventually realized that even In death, reIatIonships contInue to grow I-m still Iearning things from my father lt's like climbing a mountain.
