SOLDADO MILH?ES (PRIVATE MILH?ES) APRIL 1943 This is Portugal's finest hour, believe me. All they want is trouble. They'd have a civil war right here, just like Spain with those communists. I say let them be. Well, Dona Teresa? Where is your husband? He's putting on his medals, Mayor. If that's what he's up to, fine. He won't be long, don't worry. That's all we need. Today is his day. He knows. And it is truly an honour knowing how thankful you are for what my An?bal has done for our country. All I'm saying is he shouldn't be the last one here. He won't get lost. Great. Father? Father! Over here! Father! Was it a wild boar? A wolf. - Is it close, father? - It isn't far. Hi. Bloody hell, man! - Where have you been? - I'm sorry, Mayor. Take a look around. This is all for you! Not even Sarah Bernhardt left this many people waiting when she came to Lisbon. I beg your pardon? Where are your medals? They weren't polished. What are you on about? They weren't polished? But? You must show your medals on these occasions, man! Without them you are not Private Milh?es. You are just Milhais. Do you understand? They weigh me down, Mayor. Very well! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. Let the ceremony begin. Today, Mur?a pays tribute... ...to its most illustrious son, An?bal Milhais. A patriot who has been awarded Portugal's highest honours. From now on, the village where our brave soldier was born shall be named not merely Valongo, but Valongo de Milhais! Well done! Hurrah! MAY 1917 Nobody move! Keep your asses on the floor. I can't feel my legs anymore. Stretch out, mate. Why won't they stop? Where is this war anyway? Almonds? I brought you these keepsakes to remember me by. They will protect you. Open them on the way. I don't even know why we need to go all the way to Flanders. Apparently, if we want to shoot something we can stay right here. I said nobody look out the window! Try to get some sleep, for tomorrow we sail for France. - Game over! - Tomorrow, sir? Tomorrow or whenever it is! Why? Who said that? - I did, sir. - Are you in a hurry to kill some Krauts? It must be more exciting than this, sir. Don't worry, the CEP isn't going anywhere. We are just waiting to see if our government needs help taking care of some unpatriotic Lisboners. Nighty-night, mademoiselles. I won't be long, Adelaide. The bastard isn't far. You stay home until I get back. Then can we go to the party? Yes, but first you must do what your mother told you. - Promise? - Promise?! I already said yes! Milh?es! Can you hear me? Step around to the front. You, get up and get behind them. Yes, sir. Go on, sit. Thanks. You don't need to toss the cigarette. - You can smoke. - Thank you, sir. Nothing goes to waste in the trenches, you hear me? Yes, sir. Where are you from? Tramagal, sir. Private Francisco Malha-Vacas. Malha-Vacas (=Cow-Banger)? You miserable bastard. At ease! What do you do? Are you a stockman? A cooper, sir. The roulement is very simple! Six days up there in the front line. Six days over here in the support line. Six days in the reserve line and six days of rest back in the villages. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir! You are here to defend your country. Prior to being men, you are Portuguese. - Understood? - Yes, sir! We're all going to die here. They've sent us to the slaughter. We have machine guns and rifles to defend ourselves. They'll only kill me if I let them, I'll always shoot first. Do you want to die in your first five minutes of war? - No, sir. - Where are you from? Mur?a, sir. - Name? - Milhais, sir! You'll die tomorrow with the rest of us! Or do you think you're better than everyone else? - No, sir. - Sit down. Nighty-night, mademoiselles. First lesson of the front line. You can only count on each other. You know what CEP means, don't you? No. Portuguese Export Charcuterie. What are you doing here, Adelaide? I followed you. Is that so? You'll learn to obey me even if I have to use the belt! - You never take me hunting. - Do you think you're like your brothers? I'm a better hunter. Are we going back? The village is still far. We'd better take this path and cross the hills around this side. - You stay close to me, you hear me? - Yes, father. What are we hunting? Whatever gets in our way. Chestnuts? Yes, we'll hunt every chestnut with its head sticking out. Our teacher says there's another war. Yes, but we're not fighting this one. My brothers can't be heroes, then? War has no heroes, Adelaide. I was never a hero. I was just like everyone else. On your feet! In position! On your feet! In position! Fire! Fire! Fire! - Together! - Until the bloody end! On your right! Over the top! Fire at will! You never fucking learn! Can you handle that baby? Yes, sir! Mur?a, meet Miss Lu?sa (=Lewis)! Miss Lu?sa, Mur?a! You! You'll be the loader! 15th Infantry! Together! Luisinha, Krauts! Krauts, Luisinha! I know what this is! - It's a... - Wolftrap. It's a wolf house. It's meant to catch them. How does the trap kill the wolf? With rocks? The wolf is forced this way and left with nowhere to run. - Is this how you're going to catch it? - We need bait. A little sheep down there to lure the son of a bitch. An Adelaide. I would run! Is that so? How? Through there and there, then there and out. Come along. Wolf-killer! How far are we? How do you know where we're heading? We're heading where the wolf tells us to. Do you see this? This is the North side. North is that way, Mur?a is down there and the village is over there. Father... Were you angry because of the plaque? That's not it, love. If they did it for me they should do the same for every other l?zudo (=soldier). I'd like to see that. Can you imagine? Every soldier from Vila Real and Porto? No way. "Lanudo!" L?zudo! The soldier is an ornament, a badge for politicians to show around whenever they want! A few years ago they paraded me through Lisbon and Porto like a circus animal! It's always the same? Every anniversary of the Lys is the same fucking thing! Brass bands, gentry parades, but the soldier is always forgotten. Adelaide! Did you pray a lot in the war? Why are you asking me all these things about the war? Because you never tell me anything! I know all about it, anyway. You do? An?bal Augusto Milhais, born on 9th July 1895 in Valongo. Or rather Valongo de Milhais! Farmhand. Enlisted on 13th May 1916. Taken to France on 23rd May 1917. 15th Infantry Regiment of the PEP. CEP! That. And how do you know all this? I read your service records. Ten times. Do you want to see a treasure, love? - Is it gold? - You can't put a price on it, Adelaide. "I give you my heart and the key to unlock it. I am left with nothing else to give nor you to ask of me." Your mother asked your godmother to write the words and then she embroidered them. The Virgin watched over me in France. I promised Her this if I came back alive. Can I keep it? Sure. I kept my promise. - Malha-Vacas! - What? - How about a cup of coffee? - You know it! But without sarrabulho first it just isn't the same. It could be worse. That's it, Mur?a, well done! Protect your baby. Trench clown. - I bet that this was the last strike! - Why? Yesterday and the day before the Krauts ceased firing at a quarter to four. - What time is it? - A quarter to four. Do you want to bet a French girl? There, it's over! Give Luisinha to me. I don't feel a thing. This should hurt? Why don't I feel anything? Are you all right? Do you feel okay? Look at me, are you okay? I need stretcher-bearers, now! Stretcher-bearers! Are you alive? Malha-Vacas! Malha-Vacas! We'll never make it out alive! Shut up! We'll never make it out alive! Penacova almost died and now me! Pull yourself together! Listen, we made a?* Listen to me! We made a pact! Either we both make it or none of us does, you hear me? Do you hear me?! Do you hear me?! Father! Father! Father! The Germans are right there. The Germans are right there, let's surrender! - Get down, you'll kill us all! - I don't care, let me go! I'll shoot him! You'll live to see another day! I wasn't on kitchen duty today, so you get a free pass. - Get on with the soup, Sacav?m. - Hold the soup. At ease. Tomorrow at zero seven hundred hours Private Ferreira de Almeida of the 23rd Infantry will be executed and I've been asked to choose a man from this company. Any volunteers? What for, sir? For the firing squad. Huh? Very well. - Get out of the way. - Yes, sir. - Pour! - Yes, sir. Ready! Aim! Fire! Father! Great! Are you alive? Where's my shotgun? Easy, love. Easy! You can't do it like that or I'll end up down there. What's wrong? I'm the one who fell. It was all my fault! - What? - You fell because of me. - Because I followed you. - Don't even say that. We're getting out of this. We're getting out of this together. Just promise me one thing. If I fall asleep, wake me. What if you don't wake up? If I don't wake up don't worry, love. It means I need to rest for a while. We've mother's handkerchief to protect us. It'll help us both as it helped me in the war. Hey mate! Mind if I bum a cigarette? Thanks. It's my last one. - I thought she was Maria. - Maria? My mother's name is Maria. - What's up?! - If it isn't loudmouth! I thought you'd suspend the war for me. They said it wasn't serious yet you spent three weeks in the hospital. - One. I was detained for two weeks. - What happened? The lieutenant caught me snogging some mademoiselles. - I tried to give him the slip? - Did you tell him she was your cousin? My wartime godmother, but he didn't believe me. The more I lied the more he... Anyway, it was worth it, boys. Je have learned more French than there is in the pas compris? What does that mean? And they've learned two new words. - Such as? - "Stop that". - Is it far? - It must be behind this wall. Move to the rear where you belong, hotshots! Malha. Come here and let me teach you a few tricks. Are you trying to get back to prison? I was trying to figure out if they're Portuguese or mademoiselles. - Mademoiselles are better. - Why? They're livelier. Compris? What the hell is pas compris? Now, you tell the French bonjour. The Krauts can go fuck themselves. When you don't understand what someone is saying, you say pas compris. It's the language of the trenches. There are lads here from all over the world, right? To the Tommies you say hello. - What does that mean? - It means good morning! And that is the pas compris? Pas compris? Jesus! Are you even listening? Pas compris is when neither you nor the mec understand each other, because that's what the Frenchies say. Learn some Portuguese! Take a look at his moustache! It's just like Mur?a's! "Moustache" over there is like Penacova, he always gets the girl. Get out! Get out! - Get out! - Help! Malha-Vacas, come on! Come on! Let me go! Let me stay here! Please let me go! Let me go! Just leave me behind! So, Milhais? You almost didn't make it, huh? Will I ever get better, Dr? A few more days and you're on your feet. Some people from my village had the Spanish flu and I feel just like them. You'll be fine. Nurse? And Malha-Vacas? Is he going to make it? - Is he in your regiment? - Yes. I tried to get him out, but I couldn't see shit. I'm sorry, Dr. My brothers in arms are very rude and I have become like them. In the hospital you can say "shit" in front of the officers, it's all right. Nurse? How bad is he? From the gas, he's the same as you. From everything else, God only knows. We call it melancholy. What's that? It's a fancy word to say you're "homesick". - Feel better. - Thank you, Dr. Does it smell of gas? It can't be my pyjamas. This shit is embedded in the skin. You should get some sleep, Malha-Vacas. Please don't tell me what to do. What good will it do? I'll still be here when I wake up. - Where else would you be? - Where else would I be? I don't know! Far away from here. I wish I could wake up at home. Sometimes I realise I'm still here. Other times I don't really know. I see the river Tagus... massive. And I feel at home. But then the water turns into dirt and I drown. I'm on this road... but it's endless. I feel that if I just keep walking I'm going to see Teresa. I miss her so much... But then the trees start closing in, they start rocking me and I just want to sleep. Except I can't sleep, I must keep walking. Are we losing our minds? - Can I come in, Dr? - Certainly. How are you, Milhais? Feeling better? Yes Dr, thank you. If you're looking for your friend, he's already been discharged. Has he gone back to the front? I tried to send him to the rearguard for a while, but he wouldn't have it. Do you know what these are? After years of studying medicine do you know what I've been asked to do? Censor the soldiers' letters. You mean crossing out words? Would you sit down for a minute? With your permission. Some of these letters are deeply moving, you know? But, unfortunately, others mention the names of the places they pass or identify foreign regiments and towns, I mean... We can't have that, can we? Do you write home, Milhais? Not me, Dr. You should. It'd be good for you. I don't know. Don't you know what to say? I can't write. - Do you have a girlfriend or a wife? - Yes. Well then, man! You must write. You can't keep them not hearing from you. I'll tell you what, you tell me what to say and I'll write it. What for, Dr? She can't read anyway. She can ask the priest or the doctor, she'll manage. You're getting me in trouble, I've got nothing to say. Do you miss her? Yes. See? There's your topic for the first five lines. But I can't tell anyone what's going on here. Indeed! You know I'll censor you immediately. So, how should I begin? - What's her name? - Teresa. "My darling Teresa, I don't want you to worry, for I am well. Writing this letter is Dr Jaime Cortes?o, who was kind enough to waste his time on me. Hey Milhais, Milhais. What are you up to? The same as you, lumphead! I've been in the war for a year now, but it feels like forever. There are no heroes here, only men doing their best to survive. We laugh together to stave off fear but it still sneaks up on us like a wolf. This is for you. It creeps into the body like gas. I must kill this wolf before it kills me. - Run, run to your right! - To your right! You are the reason I survive. There are days when I think of you and of being back home, but sometimes merciless bombs make the whole earth shake. If I could write about the ocean? Now all I see is endless land? Every blast keeps me further away. Always believe in our love. Pray for me, nothing else can save me now. - Jump! Jump! - Get the hell out, get out! I'll do all I can to go back home. I am always watching over you as your handkerchief and Our Lady of Vale da Veiga are watching over me. I kiss your hands. Yours forever, An?bal. You've only brought one?! One?! What is going on here?! Is this another mutiny? Don't tell me the mademoiselles of the 15th don't like what they're given? - Sir? - Yes, private?! They've been promising us new uniforms since Christmas and this is all we got. - How many? - One! Give it to me. This is all there is! We've got food, rum and ammunition. We are lucky men! So, enough of this shit or you'll have to deal with me, is that clear?! Yes, sir! - Is that clear?! - Yes, sir! Who wants this uniform? Knock yourself out! And now, if you gentlemen think it would be pertinent, we shall resume the war with the Krauts. - Shall we? - Yes, sir! Fall in! At ease! My mother sold my baby goat. She must have needed the money. When hunger strikes? I think my wife is keeping a secret from me. Her letters are filled with clues. What about? I don't know, but? What if she's pregnant? What if I never go back? I'll never get to know my child. I know damn well how much I owe my mother, so I can't stay mad. - But it's still a pity? - Look at Malha-Vacas, all cleaned up! You can marry now, but make sure you look under her skirt first, lest she be a Scot. All I wish to say is: Au revoir. Goodbye. If you're out exploring, bring us a frankfurter. Don't get dirty. It still hurts... It hurts coming home and not having the baby goat eating from my hand. Malha-Vacas! We were supposed to go back together. We were supposed to go back together! Together... Adelaide! Adelaide! Adelaide! Wow! New duds? Do you have one in green, hotshot? It suits me better. Attention! Proceed with the distribution, man! Boys, I have some good news! At ease. Boys, we are finally being relieved. At ease doesn't mean at will! The British Command will relieve the Portuguese troops, which means we will finally march towards a good stew and a glass of red wine. Proceed with the distribution! One more month and there wouldn't be any Portuguese Export Charcuterie. You heard nothing Did you hear what the Captain said, Mur?a? Mark my words, this war will end while we're canned up in the rearguard. What's wrong? Having a new uniform is like wearing your Sunday clothes, you have to stay clean. Mur?a? - What? - What are you doing tonight? I'll be asleep. Huit Maisons is nice. You can't even smell the Germans. Let's go find some French girls and see if they have beaucoup of desire to go dancing. What now? It's the Krauts' good morning salute. Fall in! You have five seconds to fall in! Two lines, fall in! It's a Kraut offensive. And a big one. We have to go back to the front. Mademoiselles, march! 9TH APRIL 1918 BATTLE OF THE LYS We've never been hit with so many heavy mortars! Will this war ever end? I don't think so. - Can you feel the earth shaking? - 15th Infantry... 15th Infantry! Stand by! The offensive isn't over! Check your ammunition! Find out what's wrong with him! All together now! Check all ammunition! Take these almonds, they're left over from Easter. Stand by! Check ammunition! Stand by! Check ammunition! Defence positions! Yes, sir! Eyes on the line! Stand by! 15th Infantry, all together now! What are you waiting for?! All together now! In front of me! Come on! - Yes, sir! - I want that man out of here! What are you waiting for?! Are you even listening? I don't care. If Malha-Vacas is dead, I'll die too. Mur?a, listen, your pact wasn't with Malha-Vacas. Your pact is with the woman who gave you this. God willing, she'll bring you home. Take it! Stand by! Stand by! Quickly! Defence positions! Fire at will! Fire at will! To the left! Grenade! Milhais! Milhais! Are you all right? Fall back to the support line! Milhais! Yes, sir! Run, Milhais! - Fall back to the support line! - I'm not leaving, sir! I'll hold my position! Milhais, you will follow us! Repeat after me! We are going to Saint-Venant! - Milhais, say it! - Yes! - Saint-Venant! - Saint-Venant! Our Lady of Vale da Veiga, protect me now... as you've been doing all along. And I beg you, my saint, I beg you, don't let Luisinha fall me now! North. We surrender! Hey l?zudo, I am Portuguese! Then lower your weapon, fool! Which way is our line? I don't know! And Saint-Venant? Do you think we'd be here if we knew where that is? Get down! Get down! We have to surrender! We have to surrender! We're all going to die here, you hear me?! Run! Run! Help! Hey! Help! Bloody Scot! Help me, for God's sake! Help me! Help me! Help me, man! Sweetheart... Adelaide! Father! Father! Oh my love... Be careful, father! Watch out! Are you okay? It hurts... You'll be all right. What happened, my little lamb? You walked right into the wolf's den. I got lost. But I wasn't that scared. - Just a little, huh? - A little bit. A little bit... I wasn't that scared, but now I'm really hungry. We can fix that. Eat. You're very brave. Thank you! Thank you, you saved my life. Thank you. Thank you. Do you know where the Portuguese troops are? Pas compris. Don't you give me pas compris, I'm no Frenchie. What? Where's the CEP? CEP. Do you know what CEP is? CEP? Do you know what the CEP is? - CEP... - CEP. - CEP? - CEP! In Saint-Venant! - Saint... Saint-Venant? - Saint-Venant! Saint-Venant... Saint-Venant is that way! The Portuguese and the British backed up nearby, two miles. - That way? - Northeast. That direction, yes. Our Lady of Vale da Veiga, protect me now and... as you've been doing all along. And I beg you, my saint, I beg you, help me go back to my Teresa. Mur?a? Mur?a! - How can this be? - Our Lady guided me... as did my Teresa's handkerchief. Private Milhais, sir! 15th Regiment, reporting! At ease! Name? An?bal Augusto Milhais, sir! Your name may be Milhais, but you are certainly worth millions! From now on you shall be known as Milh?es (=Millions)! If it weren't for you, we'd all be dead. Come here, Milh?es! You're missing the main thing. Leave them, I don't need them. Come on, father. The medals weigh me down, love. Can I have them, please?
