A bear at Heisuke's place! Heisuke's place! You all right? What happened? Thanks for coming. How's Heisuke? What happened to Ume? Where's Ume? We must get her back first. She's gone? Yeah. No body. No funeral even. Don't. What's that noise? What's that? A bear! It's beyond our range. Fire! You hurt? No use chasing it. The way it moves, we must've missed. Chief. Red Spots, right? No mistake. Red Spots? The bear's nickname. It eats only women. So far it's killed all twelve. It ate five of them. All of them women. Last year, it killed a woman In our village too. Ever since then, we've been chasing it. We've come this far. So will you leave everything to us? Sure. We're only amateurs. We can't help. Do your best. The river has erased the bear's tracks. It walked backward. Backward? Take a look. It stomped along the same places. It walked backward. It outsmarted us. An avalanche? Chief. The bear! Did it jump that far down? Sure did. Go! That way! I'm amazed. It went that high! It ate a woman and sleeps where people can't go. It's a monster! I've never seen a bear like that. Chief, let's go. We can't see well. Pity! Let's go back. Look! Shooters. Beaters. The wind's changed. First shooter! Hey, kid! Don't you know the rule! Ass! No! It isn't Red Spots. Yuki! If it isn't Yuki! What's the matter? What's wrong? Yuki, wait! What's up? You all right? Some girl! Spring of a year earlier. Coldhearted! You don't remember me? You're... Yuki! You're surprised I'm so pretty now? Why are you back? Well... I quit working for the village headman. Quit? Why? Do something bad? He said I got pretty. I hit him. I don't understand. So I hit him. Who? The headman's stupid son. He kept after me. "Let me tough you." He said that? Did he? - Touch you? What? I didn't let him. He brought a disaster upon himself, huh? Hitting him wasn't all. How did you know? I know that much. I pushed him away. He fell. And then? I kicked him. Then what? He hit his head. He hit it on the furnace... hard. Some girl! Actually, you haven't changed. What a mess! Why? No jobs for women here. How do you live? None of your business. I can do anything just as well as you. What's so funny? I can tell why your dad is sorry you're a girl. A charm. For what? So you won't get hurt. It's nice on you. What's that? Prospecting. To find copper? I was born in this village. I love it here. I'm glad to be back. Where's Kiku? At a silk mill. Working there? Did Tome marry? She went to town. Why? Didn't she marry Jiro? All the young ones left... Except for a few who succeeded their father. Meru! You're Meru, huh? You came for me? I know. That's enough. Nonsense! Go back. Dad. Before he knows. How unreasonable! You have another two years to work! We'll talk about it tomorrow. No! You go with her and apologize! Dad, let me stay here. I'll work hard. I'll make charcoal, gather herbs... Anything! I'll work too. I'm already eleven. I want to be a bear hunter. You're too small to be a hunter. I'll earn as much as I can for you. I'll never let my parents starve. Starve? What conceit! Who needs your money! Dear! Give me herb tea. Dad... Is your leg that bad? Your dad made you work for the village headman Because he said he'd prepare Your marriage outfit when your term expired. I don't want it. Instead, let me stay here. Please! You'll disgrace me. No, I won't. How can you marry empty-handed? I won't marry then. If you won't obey your father, Get out! I disown you. Leave! Something happened and Yuki couldn't stand it. Keep out of this. All right. I'll leave! Let her go! Come to my place. I'll make you some rabbit stew. How is it? Good, huh? Listen. I don't think your dad's so angry. He loves his children very much. When you were born, He cut your hair short like a boy. With a girl, she would marry and leave home. He wanted to keep you by his side. But... After the bear incident... He can't move well. He had to quite bear hunting, which paid so well. But he wants you to be the happiest bride in town. So many things that trouble him! I'll work at the silk mill. Silk mill? It'll pay more than working for the village headman. Yeah, and Kota'll be big enough in two years. Hang on until then. You talk like a full-fledged man. But maybe that's the best thing to do. Done! Give me more. What's this? You're like a kid. She hasn't changed at all. Give me more. Excuse me. Why, Yuki! I heard a girl's voice. It was you. Been back long? Not at all. It's been so long. Two years. Two whole years. Come closer. Move. No thanks. Have some tea. I have a meeting. We'll hold a meeting tonight. Will you come too? Sure. Drop in at my place. This is for you. Thank you. Sorry we couldn't do much for you. Good night. Don't you know I'm the prettiest one here? Did you say something? No. Odd girl. I'll eat too. It's Meru! What's wrong? Something happen? Don't go in! Don't look! Don't go in! Dad! Mom! Where's Mom? Mom! Mom! This was her kimono. You can't do that! Wait! I know how you feel, but leave it to me. You don't know how I feel! Meru, where did it go? The bear lost its scent in this river. Dammit! This wouldn't have happened if I'd stayed home. Damn bear! Dammit! Shit. I found these under a beach tree. Nothing else? Eiji. Mom! Thanks for coming, everyone. We'll hold the wake for her. You go home and sleep. We'll leave early tomorrow. Gather here at dawn. Then good night. Take me with you. Please, take me with you! Chief, please take me with you. No. I won't get in the way. You can't come. Please! Let me go too! No means no. Gohei! Take me with you! Please! I beg you! Let me go with you, Eiji! We all know how you feel. But women can't go to the mountains. You were born and raised here. You know the bear hunters' rules, right? "While in the mountains, keep away from women "Let no hunters know about any villager's death. "Let no villager know what happens to any hunter." That's our code. The bear hunters' code has been strictly observed. We are not superstitious. If we have too many worries, It'll just bring on disaster. The code was made to stop it. Understand? Women should stay home and wait. It's Yuki! She's a real problem. I thought she understood. Send her back! Meru, come! We're smart, huh? Right, Meru? Meru, come. Go back. Shut up! Women can't enter the mountains. Break the rule and You will be banished. See? Surprised? No more objections, huh? Ass! You're still a girl! No! I'm a boy now! You can't fool the bear. You smell like a woman. Heard the rumor? Sure. I heard about Red Spots. It eats only women. I rubbed bear grease on myself to kill the smell. Stubborn child! Don't provoke me. If you want a homespun type, marry Mitsu. What? Never mind about me. I won't marry you. Marry Mitsu! Nonsense! Don't imagine things! I'm only saying it's better for you. Mind your own business. Go home! Do as I say! Leave me alone! Fool! Don't do that! What's that for? They're back! Then... Yuki hasn't returned yet? She's stubborn. She won't come back before she kills the bear. Even the best hunters here have wasted ten full days. Some girl! I hope she won't get into trouble. Is this enough? One more pail of water. That reminds me. There's another problem here. Are you talking about me? Staying here, she can't marry. She doesn't need to see her brothers. I keep saying to marry. You're starting it again. If I marry and leave, what about you? My late son said you're the hardest to take care of. Nonsense! You talk too much. What a daughter! What about you, Eiji? A bride. You don't want to marry yet? What do you say? Go inside. Kasuke lives here? Is he here? Yes. I'm Kasuke. Responsible for this village? Yes. An assemblyman and officials are here. Be polite to them. An assemblyman? Why? We're looking for a poacher. He shot a pheasant. His gun has a bear carving on it. We'll arrest him. Where are you? Come out! A bear carving? If you hide him, we'll arrest you too. You know, right? Our prefecture is trying to develop copper mines. This assemblyman came to inspect the mines. He saw someone poaching in the forest. What's worse. A poacher? Sir! No one in this village would be a poacher, sir. We've already investigated this. The gun used by the poacher Belonged to the bear's victim. Who own it now? I wonder... Bear hunters use only their own guns. Maybe his family. But only a daughter is left. And girls don't shot guns. We all know who has the gun. Where is she? She's been missing ever since the funeral. Those inside! Come out! Come out! Step aside! Stop! Stop it, ass! Are these all the villagers? Bear hunters? You're being pass?. You still hang around hunting bears? Leave this place! Work for our copper mines. Understand? I hope the poacher isn't from this village. Remember that. We're pass?. Maybe it's true. The world's changing fast. The kids know we're in a bad mood. They're scared. Women and children have no choice but to rely on us. But what about us bear hunters? What can we do to make a living now? Get down! Careful! Down! Idiot! You want to die? Didn't you see the sign? What's that? It was killed by the blast. We're lucky. We'll drink and eat it. Leave! Bear hunters won't fade away! Meru! Something happen to Yuki? You hungry too? Don't feel like eating? How do you feel? You must be hungry. You've been asleep all day. Eat. Better eat. An official came to talk about you. A prefectural assemblyman, too. His head was bandaged. Good, huh? Silly girl. You should've stayed home. You'll only worry us. Eiji! What a girl! Rabbit and badger fur. Make a trade for rice and miso. In summer, they get rotten fast. Please. All right. 9 liters of rice and 750 grams of miso. Good enough. Thanks. Have you heard about the killer bear recently? You mean Red Spots? A man said he saw it. Last spring at a swamp four kilometers away. Maybe it went further off. No. It's nearby. Ten days ago, I saw its tracks in the mountains. There's plenty of food there now. So it won't come down here. Is that so? Welcome. Tidy yourself. Prepare the miso. That remind me. Wasn't he your friend? A short dirty hunter came the day before yesterday. Wasn't he with a dog? Right. A big one like this. Did you see his gun? A picture here. A bear carving? He saw Red Spots' tracks too. He was a big problem. Seemed he wanted rice and miso too. That hunter was mute? He used sign language. I couldn't understand him. He didn't talk? So nobody would know she was a girl. A portable shrine. Get "strength water." Sake for the festival managers. You got married. Congratulations! Thank you. So about this girl - no... boy... Where did he go? Maybe back into the mountains. The mountains? Thank you. You go first. I was so amazed. About Yuki. What a stubborn kid she is! Eiji. What's wrong? Nothing. By the way, I got it from Mitsu. If you marry her, You'll be my successor. I thought it was a good idea. But I got it from Mitsu. Dad. Eiji likes a strong girl like Yuki. Better than me. Look at reality and speak, okay? I was shocked. I'm sorry for you. So I thought it over. I decided to let her marry that guy. Thank you very much. Your change. For your wife. They both agreed to the marriage. Congratulations! Thanks. I'm relieved. He may still be a kid. Please help him. The same to you. About you and Yuki... I know how she feels, but... We must observe the rules. We must get Red Spots quickly to settle this. Bring it! Quickly! Strength water. Yae! What's keeping you? The killer bear! What's wrong? Yae... Yae... Your wife. It's near. Yeah. Be careful. It's close by. Let's go It's Red Spots. No mistake. When it's full, it rolls on the ground to play. Re-encounter after a year. Where have you been? You really went for the bear? Didn't you tell us to leave it all to you? Ready? Let's go! We're all ready. No one's left. Very well. Let's get started, everyone! Take care. You too. Don't worry about the bear. You people came a minute too late. Take a look. Red Spots? Right. We took Ume's arm and leg And buried them. The bear came for them. It has already fled. Poor Ume. Only three of her fingers are left in the grave. We're evacuating women and children. I must go too. Goodbye. Take care. It eats only women, right? Then it won't come here anymore, right? Logically, you're right. If so, the women can't ever come home again. Will it be inconvenient if they don't come home? I don't think so, but... It will for me. Me too. Anyway, get rid of that bear. Please do your best. Have more sake. We'll get up early. Let's turn in. Sorry I was thoughtless. I'll show you. So it's you. Show me. I have good medicine. It will smart. Take it. Don't move. It won't take long. What's wrong? Say something. I was surprised when you came so suddenly. You've improved a lot, right? The chief and all - we were surprised. Keep calm. You'll son get better. You two sure are reckless. What's wrong? I'm tired. I mean it. I'm bushed. Stay where you are. What's the matter? What happened? Calm yourself! I came to get sake. I saw a bear there. You all right? It damaged only women's clothes. Red Spots. It wants a woman. It's hungry for a women's flesh. Did you hit it? I tried, but when it looked at me I got upset. Wasn't that Yuki? Yeah. She was with me. But she's gone again. Everyone. Red Spots is around here and looking for women. If it knows there are no women left here, It'll go to other villages. We must kill it before it does that. We'll change our tactics. We'll spread our dragnet and make it wide. Dragnet? Right. From now on, each of you will be a lone hunter. We'll split up and wait for the bear. Where it'll appear, who it'll attack... Only God knows. But it's the only way left for us. Must I fight the monster all by myself? Right. You can't count on help. It will be every man for himself, understand? That's how we will fight. So it's life or death. In that case, I don't give any orders. Tell me what you think. Sabu. Are you trying to say something? I... I haven't... fought with a bear alone. But... My late granddad often said, "Bear hunting is a deadly game. "When you do it all by yourself, "you can call yourself a full-fledged man." I want to be a full-fledged man. Well said. What about you? I'll do it. So will I. I'll do it. Come closer. Come out! A duel with me. What brings you? Women's scent to lure it out? The same idea as mine. This isn't a game. Leave! I won't. I said leave! Wearing a woman's kimono? A real women would be better, eh? Making yourself a decoy? The bear will eat you. Why not just wait? I've been after it a year. I can't quit now. Stubborn kid! As you wish. What's up? The bear. Keep Meru quiet. Meru, come! Let it get closer and we'll finish it. What's wrong? So much bear smell. Meru can't tell where it is. It's coming right at us. Keep off the wall! You all right? It sure was big! Red Spots' hot blood is melting the snow into steam. Ancient bear hunters would say, the bear's spirit is rising to heaven. So Red Spot became a god too.
