Why do you all look so sour-faced? Whenever I see these mugs, it's always the same long faces. Put more paint on. In the script, I have a black eye. This isn't a black eye. I could give you a natural one... What? Look at him. He doesn't look like a courtyard sweeper. An ordinary bum! Piss off. Piss off, I said! A toothless bum... Don't take offence. I'm just getting into my role. More paint! Is this your first time? Gathered up some trainees... Finish the make-up! Let's go. Take props, don't leave anything, we are not coming back. We'll liquidate the base. What is it? Okey. - A shovel. - Leave it! We're going to the objective. Faster! Okay, clear. Wake up! - Why are you still sitting? Wake up! - Done. Hurry! Hurry! Proceed only after my signal. Move! Don't lag behind! One, two! Run faster! Move! Stand and wait! - Get going. - Roger that. Let's go! Forward! Run faster, faster! No one lag behind! One, two! Hurry, hurry, hurry! I work in a store nearby. I came as soon as I heard the explosion. And here... Screaming, moaning, dead people. Please, take a look. You can't live like this any more... waking up terrified every morning. You are afraid to go to work, to send your children to school, to go to the hospital. This is terrible. It's simply horrible. DONBASS Dear Deputies! Sit down, please. Today, we'll discuss the issue of land. We have recently discussed-- - What are you doing! - This is too much! Without exaggeration. - Please, put it on record. - What are you doing? This is an article from your newspaper. All lies about me. Your journalist smeared me. Please, listen. Nobody will listen to you. Get out of here. This is an outrage! Get out! - And take away this newspaper! - Venerable Mrs! Just wait, I'll spill dirt on you! Any amount of dirt wouldn't be enough on your stupid head! Take her away from here right now! - What do you want? - I'll explain again-- Don't bother explaining anything to me! Go home and explain there, you lunatic! What? Didn't you get enough money? Call the police! Who are you to spill shit on him? He what?! Has he stolen all the money on the planet?! Get out, you mental tramp! - You need a shrink. - It's you who needs one! - I will not let you print lies about me. - What lies? - Who wrote lies about you? - Your husband's guys. Did I write about your bribes? That was an individual I spilled on. - I warned you I'd come. And here I am. - Get out of here! Understood? Next time, ladies and gentlemen, I'll come, I'll spill petrol on you, and I'll burn you to hell! Do it! Stop. You're not going to leave. I am not going to allow you to write lies. Who'll clean this mess up? - Let him clean it himself! - Call the police. Please, call them! Let them arrest the bribe-taker. - Did he touch you? - Yes, he "touched" me. Whore. Please, listen. I don't know who, but he wrote that I took 100,000. He spilled shit on me, as a journalist. Now he got it back. It's a serious matter to me. It's about my reputation. I will not let anyone destroy it. Don't listen to her. A performer has arrived and is giving a show. - And we should feel blessed now? - You've interrupted our session. Well, I'll explain to you why! No need for your police or court. I can defend myself. - Woman, calm down! - I'll call the police in a moment. - And then what? - It's not me who you need to arrest! But that man who wrote that I took a bribe! - That's not how it works. - Then how does it work? - Leave it! - It's evidence... What did she spill on him? With shit? If you don't know, then smell it. Oh, that bitch... It should've been done a long time ago. Let him have a wash and get him back to work. Because I must have his signature today. Sure, what did you think? Serious people are waiting. Sure. I'll call you later... Good day. Good morning! Why do you herd together here? Let's go in. Please, let us in. Please, step inside. Go ahead, ladies. Please, come in, come in. Well, what do we have here? It's good that you're here, Nikolai Alexandrovich. - Good morning, Boris Michalowich. - Good morning. Well. Come in, come in. Well, what can I say? Please, look around... All this should've been yours. What do we have here? A box of flour packs. Do you see? What's this? Canned beef. Entire crates. And in the crates - canned food. Let's look over here. - Sausages. - A fridge full of sausages. Reportedly, the maternity hospital is starving. Somehow I don't believe it. The fridge is full of meat and sausages. Lots of meat. I understand... Please look here. Cartons of juice. There are whole cartons full of juice. Open it! Medicine. I was told that you don't have any. Anaesthetics for the women giving birth. Turns out you do have them. Perhaps Dr. Kowalenko was selling them. To someone. Please, look! What's going on here? Meat thrown in with medicine. Lots of meat. We'll give everything to you. These potatoes are rotting. The potatoes are rotting... And here's grits. Potatoes are rotting, mice have started to eat the grits, and you have nothing to eat. - Baby milk. - Baby milk. Look, baby milk... - Boxes full of baby milk... - Boxes full of baby milk! Potable water. About 50 bottles. All this we have sent you. I had a row with partisans about it. I told them the hospital must get this food. A fridge full of meat. Another fridge with meat. Most of you know that I chased soldiers out of here. I chased them with a bat. I didn't let them come in here. Looks like conflict came here from within. Because your head doctor, who should feed you and look after you, he literally was robbing you. He stole from you, he didn't give you food. Here's a boy with us. When's the last time you saw sweets? Tell me, go ahead. When was the last time you saw sweets? Do you see? The child doesn't even remember. Let's go to Kowalenko's office. Please, I'll show you. We'll see full bags of Snickers. Can you imagine? When our children no longer remember what sweets taste like. The boy doesn't even know what sweets are. And in Kowalenko's office, there are mountains of sweets. People are mean and greedy. Suchow stole the money! Oh dear me! Suchow is standing right here. I'm sorry, it's not about you. Slip of the tongue. Because my head is spinning, from all this... Cash was seized from Nikolai Kowalenko. More than 40,000. He was trying to leave the city. You know very well that he took the ultrasound equipment. He did it in secret. Maybe someone knew... It'll come out eventually. He smuggled it out in secret. He deprived our city's girls of decent medical care. Pregnant girls could have learned about the "what", "how" and "why". And the "by whom". And that bastard took it. In secret. We've recovered some things. By the way. Please look at this photo. It's Irina Sushko, his mistress. Sure, that's his personal business. But he hid stolen goods at her place. We recovered some of the things from there. What we found there? Various gynaecological equipment... which is missing from here. Medical systems, syringes... And so on. You'll see everything. Oh, please. Toilet paper. Toilet paper. What else? What's this? Adult diapers. Apparently they thought they'd need them soon. Incredible. What else? Diapers. Well, of course. Children's diapers. They have no children, but they took the diapers. Stolen so much that it makes my head swim. I won't lie. I knew that not everything makes it to you. But for the sake of the children... There were more than a hundred births, no? I kept silent because of that. Once, I spoke to Nikolai Suchow. Although it didn't concern him, but the medical personnel. He took care of it, and I didn't interfere. I thought everything was in order here. Because when I brought the goods, I was told that everything goes to the medical personnel. What kind of cynic you must be to steal from those who are the most valuable to us. Our unborn children. Yes, Nikolai? Am I right, kid? I'll show you those Snickers. You've even forgotten what they look like. Dr. Kowalenko hid them right in front of you. I'll show them to you. Let them be ashamed, the bastards and murderers in white coats. Here, this is for you. It's yours. What do we say? Thank you. It's okay, never mind. Well, comrades, return to your stations. As you see, everything is here, and it's for you. Nikolai Alexandrovich will take inventory, after those thieves, and will distribute what is left over. And now - to work. To work! Give birth and deliver babies. Cook porridge. What's for dinner today? Pasta? Great! Pasta with sauce. Please, leave, comrades. Close the door. Zip up your fly! It's not visible... If it's "not visible", then you could manage without me. Where is he? What an actor! I was tempted to open the door. That would've been a surprise. Meat, canned food, medicine. And the clerk sitting in the middle of it all. - Hand it over! - For safe-keeping... - As we agreed upon? No tricks? - Don't insult me. You're the one who's the actor. Nikolai Alexandrovich, take over the estate. You hand it over. I have things to take care of. You're not the only clumsy clown. Yes, Piotr Nikolajewich? I'm working. Yes, of course, at work. Now? No, I can't right now. I'm busy. But I have people... I have people at hand. I'll call you as soon as I'm free. Good day. Documents, please. - I've already been checked. - Are we going to argue? - Passengers, too. - Here you go. Faster. Thank you. - I've found something in here. [Bribe] - Sorry, I accidentally left it in there. A joker? Please, get out of the car. Here you go, ma'am. - Nice bird. - Yeah... - Yours? - No. His! Please open the boot. - Are you carrying any weapons or drugs? - No. - What's that there? - Personal things. - Yours? - No. His! - Why is he so quiet? - He's in shock. We are on our way to the hospital. I'm evacuating him from this zoo. He looks like he's from a zoo. - Tell them what you have there. - Personal things. Take it. You can close the boot. Look. A familiar face. I've seen him somewhere before. I don't know. Maybe he's a deputy? Ask. First, First. "Artist" here. Ka-ram-zin. Check what we have on him. The computer is not working. Roger that. - Is this your passport? - Yes. Is something wrong? No, nothing. Can I have it back? Take it. No need for you to drive around in this area. Thank you very much. The shells have just stopped flying... I'm telling you, it was like a fireworks show! Cool. I'm going, but I don't know if they haven't stolen everything. Maybe there's still something left, or maybe someone moved in. It's such a nice, cosy flat. Maybe it would be better if someone's moved in there. He would look after the flat. We would get along somehow. We wanted to glaze the balcony. We bought windows and frames. So we could turn it into a storage room of sorts. A shell hit the building. All windows shattered. Thank God we survived. Now that it's quiet, I'm going back to see if anything is left. All our neighbours have gone, there's nobody left to ask about our house. We'll glaze the balcony anyway. It'll be a storage room for preserves. Trouble is to get glass now. So many windows have been destroyed. If the house is gone, we'll leave again. I want to see it so much. Maybe the house is still standing. Don't worry. My neighbours said that it's all right. Only the house next door was hit by a shell. All windows flew out. And there's a hole in the wall. But no one died. Welcome to the People's Republic! Why do you look so sad? Glory to the Ukraine! Does anyone have any guns? - Or grenades? Huh, lads? - How much are you paying? Funny. I only buy tanks. Open back here! Maybe someone has stuff for a soup? Without some fat it doesn't taste good. Oh dear, don't be like that. I don't want to search you. Ladies, find something to give to him. Treat a soldier. Come here, son. Thank you, mother. Take this. Not all of it! Cut off a piece. What would I do without you? The "Spartak" squad will check you more thoroughly. Go. Nice guy. What he... Never mind. When we travelled to Romania, we sold them cigarettes. There's always someone who asks for a fags. When was that? They've screwed up such a great country. I could still be selling those cigarettes. All men, get the fuck out. Stand in a row. Hey, get out faster. Go, go! Everybody? Yes. So what the fuck? Men... Broads are fighting for you. While you hide in the cellar. Yes, you. Why haven't you volunteered? Are you afraid? I have a sick mother. We all have a sick mother. Our mother is only one. One for everyone. And she's sick. Our homeland. Our mother. Our motherland is sick. Infested with the plague of fascism... She is suffering. She asks her sons for protection. And you... You run away like rats. I'll divide you into two squads and send you to the front! Are you scared? Everyone undress to the fucking waist! We'll see who you are soon. - Take it off quickly. - Move! Get out your passports! Faster! Give me the phone! Open the outgoing call list! Skull, Boar. Cornflower? Petrunia, Zidane. It's fucking code-names in here. What? They are my homies! Lads! I have a German here. - "Walter"! - What? - It'll be fine, don't worry. - Passports. Where are you going? - To Donetsk. - What for? For work. We are journalists. - Walter Michael. - That's me. - Deutschland! - Fucking fascist! We caught a fucking fascist! No, no! - I'm a journalist. Journalist! - Ja, ja, ja... - Not a fascist. - Hitler, kaput! Fascism is bad. Very bad. - I'm a journalist. Journalist. - Journalist? Journalist... Look, journalist, what these bastards are doing. - Those from there. - Watch carefully. They bombard peaceful people. - Children are sitting in basements. - Day and night. Women and children hide in basements. They are afraid to go outside. They bombard day and night. Understand? Iz bad! Don't have to bomb. Listen to me. You were at the fascists' side. You saw the fascists. They bombard. - They're bombing civilians! - That's very bad! - You're a journalist! - Write what you saw. Write the truth. We have a corpse here. Do you want to take a photo? Come on! We'll show you, my word of honour. Come with us. - There are dead bodies-- - Enough of these jokes! Finish up with him. Take it. Back into the car. Maybe you are not a fascist, but your grandfather certainly was one. Everything is broken. There's only one jar left. As soon as I took it, the damn shelf crashed to hell. - Hi guys! - Hey! Take it. Hey! Here you are, guys. - Hey! - Hey. You're not the only one here. - Give me. - Have it. Wait. The third team in ten days... Good morning! He's a journalist from a German newspaper. He's curious what's going on here. - What's happening here? - What's going on here? Something is going on? What's going on? - What's going on? - What's going on? This is a war! - Let's take a few pictures as a souvenir? - Sure! Mum will see my photo in the newspaper. - Donetsk Republic! - Sasha. These guys? Guys, join in. Without you, the picture isn't complete. - Take it without us! - Okay. Let it be so. - Wait... - Sasha. - Ask them where are they from. - Where are you from, guys? - Where are we from? - We are locals. - Locals from where? - Not far. What's it called, guys? - Here. - From nearby village. - Horlivka. - We are from Gorlavka! - Let's take one more. - Go for it! Hi, goons! - Who's the boss? - Who's in command? He's the commander. Me? "Little" is the commander. No, I'm not. He's the commander. Me? No, he is! Me? I'm not. He's the commander. What's wrong with you? I'm not. - What the fuck is going on here? - German journalist... - Who are you? What do you want? - We're journalists for a German newspaper. Can we ask a few questions? Are you the commander? Who? Me? I'm not the commander. But I'll get you one. Fetch that... Archimandrit. Get away from here. Take cover behind the houses. Why are you standing here like dicks? Get in position! Get back ten steps. - All right, let's move. Let's move. - Stand there. - Have you called for me? - Listen... We have a German journalist here. Talk to him. This is Chapaj, our commander. He'll explain everything to you. - Which one of you is German? - Him. I'll be translating. - Stop. Have you asked for permission? - No. - Then ask. - Can I? You can. I like to pose for photos. Did you get it? Enough! And you, German, listen to me carefully. I served in Germany, I know your "Hände hoch" very well. When our grandparents entered your fascist Germany, with a mission to save all nations of this world, from that "brown" plague, we kicked the shit out of that silly master race. We kicked all the shit out of their blunt heads! We overwhelmed you with our "Russian World" and fucked you all hard and fast! - Don't shit yourself, German! - Soon, he'll shit himself. Translate it! Well, we made order in Germany, but forgot to clean out our motherland. And a fascist plague has spread. There, in Western Ukraine. If we hadn't taken up arms in time, I swear they would've slaughtered us all. I would swear on the Bible. Yeah! But now - no fucking way. They won't get a scrap of our land! Not a fucking scrap! Translate it for him. Not a fucking scrap! Nothing! We'll go to Lviv. And then to Europe! Look, corridors. There's no light. It's dark. In here, we store food. Food. Reserves. And here are the people. The toilet isn't working. Take a look. Not working. Come in. You'll see how we live. "Thank you" to our presidents and leaders. "Thank you". Look. Crack in the wall. There's no electricity, heating or water. We live any way we can. The pipe is leaking, everything is moist. I don't know how it'll end. It's draughty. Legs and hands are freezing. Everything is damp. This is a room. This is a table. People are sitting at it. This is my mattress. I live here. Come on. This is another table. There are people here too. Look, there's a pipe. Let's go. This is the door. I wrote this. "Close the door, or I'll bite you!" Let's go. Do you see? People... Eliminate this fungus. We breathe it. The moisture is terrible. - Do you smell that stench? - Let's go further. Look, this is also a table. It looks like this. And a candle. Last one. - She's sick. - The girl has a fever... Come here. Look at these children. He was supposed to start school this year. But he's sitting here. Shell hit their apartment. They survived because they were out. We've accommodated them here. It's terrible. We live like primitive people. This way, please. Shell fragments killed the passengers of the trolleybus. They also destroyed a car parked nearby. Mum. - Mum, it's me. - I see. I brought food. I see. Bread. Sausage, butter. Cheese. Caviar. Oranges, apples. Juice and water. Thank you. Don't thank me. Don't thank me, just come. Come with me. Why are you sitting in this shithole? Mum. What are you doing here in this hole, in the middle of all this? No. You have a flat. We have a home. No one bombards us. We have protection, it's safe there. Mum... Don't sit in this hole with the rest of them. You have a house with hot water, where you can take a shower. Katia cooks, you wouldn't have to lift a finger. Nobody shoots at us. - I don't have a home. - What are you talking about? - Mum! - Leave the woman alone. - She doesn't want to. - Lay off! Mum, you're bringing shame on me. I'm ashamed at work! They know that you live here and they ask me why I'm not taking you away from here. Shut up! What should I tell them? That you're crazy? - How can you talk to your mother this way? - I'm not talking to you! You think this piggery is better for you? Lice everywhere. No toilet! In this moisture? With these crazy people? Mum! Mum, stop! Mum... Mum, open up. Mum, open the door. Open, I say! Mum! Mum! Open it, for fuck's sake! What do you want?! It's not a show! Get lost! Mum! Mum! Turn the camera off. Turn the fucking camera off! Mum! Open the fucking door! What do you want? Get lost! I'm gonna fuck this shithole up! Get out of here! Mum, damn it! Open the fucking door! - Let's go. - Are we not waiting for Mum? - No. Maybe I'll send the boys? They'll help her pack. Moron. - From Aleksander Aleksadrych? - Yes. - Come in. - Thank you. Please, take off your coats. Wait a minute. Come in. - Good morning. - Nice to meet you. Come in. Please, have a seat. Tea? What brings you here? As I understand it, there are three things? I am the vice-president of the Foundation for Saint Theodosius Kherson. We came with a peace-keeping mission, a good-will project. We've brought sanctity for you. The icon of Saint Churila Plionkovich. It's a great symbol, which can be as a symbol, and the great saint always associate with... ...that it can defend, help and suppress. We also brought, from the Holy Land, relics of the great holy martyr, Theodosius Kherson. We want to appeal to your citizens, call upon Christians around the world, that they would pause and contemplate. That every Christian would ask himself, what he can do and how to help... in this serious matter. As it turned out. Terrible bloodshed, especially children, and those who are peaceful citizens. Yesterday, we saw that something terrible had happened again. Well... That, finally... for those Christians... the Christian will of all Christians... By the New Year period, that everyone would pause and help Novorossiya get back on its feet. Well... It's a good initiative. How can we help? Please. Saint Theodosius. No, no, no. It's for you. God bless you. Well. So? So we want to reward those who decorated with heroism, your land. Today, at the philharmonic. We want to show appreciation and that... always nearby. Through a wonderful Christian sanctity, through the image of a folk hero, Churila Plionkovich. Let people know that the prize will always find its hero. And there are many of them here. Is that everything in this matter? Yes, that's what we wanted to tell you. That heroism and holiness go hand in hand. And it's inevitable. I understand. The Christian prize isn't on Earth but in heaven. So its value isn't down here. Only up there. It all depends on how a Christian lived his Christian life. Because a Christian life and a wicked life of war, aren't the same. The amount of earthly awards has no meaning before God. The values up there are on an entirely different level. And what would you say about... What about the relics? Relics...? Relics. The relics are a good initiative. Thank you for the initiative. Do you have any more questions? Good luck in your good mission. Goodbye. Tea? - What kind of circus was that? - From Aleksander Aleksadrych. You said to let them in. Well, what do they want? Accommodation and meals for a week, three Mercedes cars, and a van for the relics. Out! One Mercedes will be enough. - They won't fit in one. - They'll fit in the van with the relics. What about those freight wagons? You've become quiet lately, brother. What the fuck? Everything was under control. Who interfered? What kind of a diversion is this?! They don't have any fucking respect, stealing freight wagons from the Daddy! Damn it. Fuck them all without lube. And that fucking Churila with Plionkovich, God fucking bless them... What do you have to say about this soldier? I have something to say about more than just him. I wanna say... If you don't understand what you are being told... Don't understand... what you are told in clear Russian... Told and asked. No one is without sin. Everyone knows that. This applies especially to the locals. When you come back from a patrol you have to sit in the base. Don't loot from the flats. Don't you understand? Think about it. As for Makar... Let's decide together. How many times have you been told? Before leaving the base, you must report to the commander. If he agrees, you can go. And if not, you can't. You have to stay at the base! Don't wander around this fucking scrapyard of a city! Fucking scrapyard. - Wander around... - They go for a tea. - Don't wander around, do you understand? - Understood. - OK. - Fuck that, comrades. - Five days of detention. - Send him to work! I can't hear you. - I understand, I understand. - I can't hear you! What? Understand? - Affirmative. - Affirmative. You'll be cleaning the backyard for that woman whose phone you stole. Carry it out. Now, about Bondar. The first row, three steps forward, march! Turn! Keep an arm's length distance. Let's go. Wider! Wider! For looting, Bondar will go through a corridor of shame. Go! - Here you go, thief! - Bless you! Don't hit his head. Take it! Bitch! Get up! - Smile! - Go, go! Move your ass! What are you staring at? Move your ass! What'll we do with the other one? - Walk the corridor. - Let's forgive him. - Louder! - Forgive him! Okay. You're forgiven this time. Next time, you'll go through the corridor twice. - Five days of detention! - Affirmative. Five days of detention. Dismissed! - Gentlemen, to whom should I talk? - Regarding? - I got a call, they've found my car. - And? Here it is. - This is your car? - Yes. Do you have the documents? Here you go, the documents. Go ahead, look at them. Is everything alright? All good? - All good. - Officer, don't forget your things. Soon. After some small formalities... - Can you help us carry the box? - Sure. No problem. Put it there. The owner of the jeep has shown up. Take care of it. Come in, don't be shy. - Batiania. - Simeon. Sit down, we'll talk. How much did you pay for the car? - As much as it's worth. - Sure. Give me your passport. Well done, it's all right. My car was stolen. Got a call from you today, that it was found. At first I didn't believe it. But it's my car. I have all the documents. The officer has the keys. So, can I take it and leave? I can write a letter of thanks. After all, it's a new government, finally. You can write that later. What do you do for a living? I had a small business. But it ended up running at a loss. Check it out. What kind of business? Nothing serious... Can I have the car? Soon. Sign this paper and you can go. Write. What's this? Write. "I, Simeon so-and-so, entrust you to hold this vehicle..." You have everything there. ID number and stuff. Write. - What does that mean, entrust...? - It means that you entrust. Tell me, whose side are you on? Those monsters' or ours? Tell me, honestly. Are you with the fascists or with us? Do you think I need your car? So that nazis won't get in here? Or don't you care? I don't know politics. I ran a business, I don't know anything. I'm good with the guys, they are good with me too. Everything was under control. I have to pick up my daughter from kindergarten. They called me that it has been found. I came. Thank you, new authority. I wasn't wrong about you, Sim. Write out the transfer of ownership. - What ownership? - Is this your car? - It's mine... - Then transfer it to us. - That means... you take my car? - What? You think we should ride on bikes while we protect you from the fascists? Or are you still confused and don't know which side you're on? Maybe you're with them? Do you want to think about it in a cell? No, you don't want that. I can tell that you're a decent boy. Write. "Me, Simeon"... What's your last name? "...Simeon Alexandrovich, I entrust this vehicle..." And so on. What are you looking at? Write! Don't you have to pick up your daughter from kindergarten? - You want to take my car? - We don't want to. We have already. Only temporarily. Till victory over the fascists... We risk our lives for you, and you begrudge us your car. Write. Here, an example. Copy it. What? No? - This is theft. - No, it's an expropriation. Put away the phone. Put away the phone! Don't defy me. Or you'll regret it. Take the pen. So you said that your business was making losses? The phone will be very useful to you. If you want to pick up your daughter from kindergarten. Or we can pick her up. Fill in the papers first, and then call your buddies. Tell them to gather... 100,000 dollars and bring them to us. What did you think? The people's government needs support too. - Where would I get that much money? - 150. A word more and it'll be 200. Sasha, they robbed me. I don't know who. New policy of the party. I don't want to talk about it over the phone. I'm screwed. Listen to me carefully. Get the money from the bank. The chequebook is in the safe. Three cheques are signed and stamped. If you make a mistake, fill in one of the others. You helped Liosha. Do you know anybody at the administration? Help me. Whom should I call? Yes, I have a number. This isn't okay... Extortion of respected citizens... I'm at the administration. Find out who's in charge! I want to get out of here. Let's go, we have business to take care of. It doesn't work like that. "Volunteer from Punishment Squad" [Punishers - RU media label for UA soldiers] Son, how long have you been waiting here? Has the bus been here yet? What do you have written on there? - He's a punisher. - Who? - A fascist! - Ah, a fascist... Gotcha, my dear. I have to visit my daughter. There are children, family. I need to help her. It's hard now without help. It's not far, only 10 kilometres. It's too far for me now. I used to walk even farther. I can't do it any more, my dear. I must go. How long have you been waiting? Has the bus been here yet? Brother, have a light? Who's this clown? A punisher. We brought him out to talk to people, so he could look them in the eye. Not bad. Not bad. Boys! A punisher has been brought out here to socialise. What the fuck! Are you a volunteer? Want a smoke? Take it! - What, don't you like it? - Give me a sec. I'll take a picture of you. Together, one-two-three. Nice coincidence... - Let's take a picture. - With this fuckhead. Turn his face to the camera. - Done? - Yes. All of us now. Turn it so you get us all. - So that he's visible... - Smile! - Aim at him. - One more. - Show me. - Cool, with the smoke. - Cool. - Only the fascist is out of focus. Don't move your mug, punisher! - Hey, girls... - He won't let any skirt pass. - Hello, girls. - Hey. - Are you cold? Join us. - What are you doing? Come here for a photo. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity... You won't find such a monkey again, not even in the zoo. Watch out, he might bite. I'm kidding. Take it. Now me with the girls. - One more? - That's enough. - Fucktastic. - Show me. A true fascist. "Ukrop". ["Dill weed", phonetic pun of "Ukrainian"] Fucking maggot. - And a fucking volunteer... - Let the older generation through! Film the grandma! Knock his teeth out! This is a "thank you" from the nation. You fight against the nation, bastard. Tell us, did you shoot at people? Look at me and answer. - Did you shoot at people? - No! Where did you serve, pig? In the kitchen. - You're lying! - Fucking bullshit! - Son of a bitch! - Who did the shooting then? - He served in the kitchen... - I'll show him the kitchen. Film the grandma! Tell me honestly. Tell me, who sent you here? - Can you tell me that? - Mum! Mum! - Tell me honestly, who sent you here? - Mum! Mum! - Look at her! Look her in the eye! - Mum! - Leave me! Tell me who hired you. You wouldn't work for free, right? Who hired you and how much do they pay? Tell the truth, how much do they pay you? Why can't you tell me? I'm begging you, tell me the truth. - Who hired you? - Answer, don't look away. - I'm sorry, I... - For what? For dead children? - You're not in church, bastard. - Tell the truth. Tell me who sent you, I'll forgive you. Please, I'm begging you. Tell the truth. Who sent you? - No one! - No one? Don't lie. Don't lie to me, pig! There are people who'll kill you, bastard. Understand? - Mines. They placed them in a field... - My friend died from a mine! My cousin almost stepped on a mine. The whole field laid with mines! You did this? He spotted the wire at the last moment! - My grandson lived with me... - Tell her! Children died. Because of you. It's your job! - Look her in the eye! - Who? Who did it? Not ours. Our people wouldn't do it. Children died! Kill him! - Finish him! - He needs a bullet in his head! Wait, what are you doing? Silence! Kill him! They beat and torture ours too! We shouldn't have pity for him! Kill the bastard! You did all this, and you don't even ask for forgiveness. No mercy for the bastard! - Why kill him? - They'll kill him! They will! Hit him in the throat, let him choke on his own blood. Gentlemen, there are children here. They kill and don't care about the children. They kill our children! My neighbour got blown up. The whole street was covered with meat. A beautiful, young and healthy woman. She went shopping. I would knock him out. Do it, son! Be a man. - Do it! - Kill him. Come on, Stas. Hit the bastard. You know he deserves it. Nobody will ever forgive you! Hit him! Stas, not like that... Hit him in the fucking face. Why's he still alive? Stop! Why are you interfering?! - Are you taking him back? - Let him die. Bandit! Guys, kill him!

Lots of love. Thank you. The next wishes for the newly-weds come from the deputy commander of "labour"... ["childbirth process", mispronounced "squadron"] He's comrade "Coupon", deputy commander of "Lumberjack". I'm the deputy commander of the squadron. You've already said a lot of nice words, but I want to add more. - Don't blush. - It's hot... Above all I wish you love... Long years of happiness and children. Let the first be a boy. - There'll be a boy! With a rifle! - Love each other. Long and often. All the best! Thank you. Kiss! Kiss! I want to say something. I wanted to say thanks to Comrade Nadia.

Wishes for the newly-weds from the deputy of the Novorossiyan Parliament, Oksana Pocyk. [Pocyk - "the potty"] I congratulate you with all my heart. As you know, I love to write poetry and... I write sometimes. Unfortunately, I'm very busy and didn't have time to write one for you. That's why... Two wedding rings have joined two people, let happiness last forever. Drops of dew shine like pearls, life is getting beautiful. Let good fortune and happiness fill your home, and let the laughter of children be heard. Understanding, sympathy and comfort, affection and loyalty. Everlasting. On behalf of the Novorossiyan Parliament, I wish you all the best and thanks to everyone who helped organise this celebration. - Be happy, darlings. - Thank you! Kiss! Kiss! Dear guests! Join in our compliments. Vanya! You are a real man now! Look what my friend sent me. Can you see? Kick him! Come on! Cool! We are leaving. We have to shoot for a bit. - Ah, good hunting! - See you later, brother. Don't drink it all. Yes, sunnie? I told you we didn't drink... I meant she didn't drink. Listen, we went shopping... Shoes and a couple of t-shirts. Yes, bunny. And a grey tracksuit for men. Have I ever lied to you? It's happened, but only a few times... I was sleeping, at home. We have wounded and dead. We have wounded and dead. Send us everything you have. Again with those sour faces... Real discouragement to work. Why do you look so desperate? Whenever I see these mugs, it's always the same long faces. Look at yourself... The mirror is right in front of you. Look at yourself. You must love your work. Put more paint on. It doesn't look like a black eye. - Have they paid you lately? - No, not a penny. - And you? - Me neither. - They haven't paid? - No... They said they'd pay, so you'll be paid. Stop complaining. - Commander, what about the money? - These too. Are they all here? One, two, three,... eight, nine. All here! - Sure? - Yes! I have them all. Twelve pieces will be enough? Good. Wait. Soon. Commander, do you have a smoke? Yes. Yes. Give it to him. Tell your people to secure the area. Don't let anyone in. There has been a murder. Seal off this area. Murder. Twelve bodies. Get to work. Good day. We have a murder... There and there. Look around. Murder. Twelve bodies. Here, there... and there. - Let's work for a bit... - Sure. - What? - We've found something over there too. - Do we know the identities of the victims? - They don't have any documents on them. - Any empty cartridges? - The technicians are looking. Everything as planned. We'll start shooting in a moment. Okay. Let's go. On my signal. Last night, a terrible crime was committed. On the set of a film about the peaceful citizens of Donbass. - What can you tell us? What did you see? - What can I tell you? I didn't hear anything at night. Neither screams nor moans, nor explosions. Nothing special. In the morning, I took out the trash. I saw it. It was terrifying. I'm sorry, I can't take it any more. - Cut! - Let's get a wide shot. Let's do it again? Let's try again. Please stand here again. We'll do it again. Please. What did you see? I didn't hear anything at night. Neither screams nor moans, nor explosions. Nothing special. In the morning, I took out the trash. I saw it. They had a night shoot. Such nice people. And now they are dead. I don't understand it. My God! Such angels! All killed... Excuse me. Stop. Cut.
