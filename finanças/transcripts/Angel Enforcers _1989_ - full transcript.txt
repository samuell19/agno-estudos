- Freeze! - Nobody move! Drop the gun! Ladies, you've done very well. You've earnt a reward... You're granting us leave? - Giving us a raise? - Hey, not so fast. I wonder what's coming! As you've done so well, I've an important case for you. You will maintain radio silence. You should take no action until we release the signal balloons. Marianne, for me this is a simple operation. You, however, will need help. Uncle Dan, we can handle ourselves. Yes daddy, that's true. - Balloon-watching tires my eyes. - But not girl-watching! - Routine work bores me. - Our support work is important. - Stay alert - No problem. What's he doing here? - Is this too hard? - No, it's fine. - Shall I do your neck, sir? - Not a chance. - Does that feel alright? - You're kidding. Where's that damn girl! She's late. No one else knows about the operation. I must thank you. - We're just doing our job. - Excellent. - What is it? - Mr Cho's arrived. He's asking for you. Tell him he'll have to wait. - Now, act casual. - Remember, it's just routine. - We'd better go. - Of course. After you... See to their needs. This way please. Your tea. Mr Cho, I'm sorry you had to wait. Have you been looked after? I stayed to see "The African Star". Normally, people wait for me. - Ask him, today's an exception. - I'm honoured. Your lawyer has the 20 million dollars... So I've come for the diamond. Yes, of course. Shall we go into my office? No, we can do it here. Certainly. I'll fetch it. Good quality for the price. I hope my friend cuts a good deal.. - Hey, where's your boss! - I'll call him. I've some samples of our beautiful stones. Boss? Paul says it's good stuff. Would you like to take a look? Okay, I'll be there in 15 minutes. I'll wait here. Let's go. - Sorry, your girl didn't show, sir. - To hell with her. We're very proud of the superb craftmanship. - Hey, Marianne. Buy something. - What, and bankrupt myself? "The African Star"... Wouldn't you like to put this in some beautiful girl's navel... - Mr Cho, if you'd just sign here... - Don't rush me. I'm examining the merchandise. This way... Hello, boss. Ah, Mr Solo. I think you'll find the gems exceptional. I've asked these experts to join us today. Fine, shall we begin? - Oh, Paul, the boss has guests. - Okay, this way. Don't move! Get in there! Freeze! Freeze. Police! You're surrounded. Drop your guns or we'll shoot. Don't shoot or he's a dead man! Stay back! Freeze! Move it! Go, I'll cover you. Come on now, ladies. Hold it! Move! Are you okay? So, are you selling these or what? This way! Something's wrong! That way! - Everybody split up. - Wait, we better split up. You double-crosser! - What happened to my father? - He needs a doctor. Blowing your cover like that! If I hadn't reacted an officer would be dead. You've been in deep cover for a year: that's expensive. Did you discover Mr Big's identity? I almost nailed the son of a bitch. So he can't stay anonymous for long. Come in. Hello, sir. Hello, Marianne. Has your father been released from hospital yet? No, he's being kept in. Too bad. He's a good man. - He's a good man? - He's been a sergeant for 20 years. Ben! I didn't recognise you before. - You remember? - You're old friends? We were kids in the same orphanage. We looked out for each other. Then it's fitting you saved her. Any word on their inside man? He disappeared in the shootout. We think he's in hiding. Benjamin, what's their next move? They'll send someone to kill me. - So what do we do? - We lay a trap for him. If we trap the hitman, we can discover who the kingpin is. If that's how you want to play it, you'll have our full cooperation. - You like being a marked man? - I've no choice. Don't worry, Yvonne and I will help. I want this case finished, once and for all. It will be good for moral. Daddy, you should rest. Every time you close your eyes, it may be your last. Why not relax? Watch TV? Winnie, I want to ask you something. How do you write the word "entrance"? Daddy, you're not stupid. Everybody knows that. Hey, help your dad or I'll be a laughing stock. That's it. It's late. Tell Marianne I had to go. You could stay if you wanted to. - We need to speak. - Sorry, I must rush... another time. - How are you feeling, dad? - Better? You shouldn't waste your time coming to see an old goat like me. Just find the bastard who kicked me. What a mess. Marianne, you've a lot to learn. Sergeant's stripes don't come easy. Try to learn from Yvonne. Hear that? I've had worse. If you were raped: that's heavy shit. These animals stop at nothing. Daddy, don't speak like that. It's so gross. Huh! If I were better educated, I'd be your boss by now. What do you mean "competition"? It's the wrong word. Maybe you can tell me how to write "entrance"? It's something like "vegetable". You're a graduate: you should know. You tell her! Education isn't everything. Your written Chinese is like the water in a reservoir. - What do you mean? - It's really low. It's good English, that's necessary for promotion. We'll read the typewritten report. Anyway, stop moaning. For you. - Happy birthday! - But it's not for a few days. It's today according to the ancient Chinese lunar calendar. Don't you know it's cool! I'm in hospital, that's all I know. But, as long as I've got my presents, I don't care what's trendy. I don't like it. Where's the boss? The deal's off, everyone's dead. - Where's "The African Star"? - With the lady cops. I was promised 800.000 dollars, no matter what. Too bad. So, you won't pay? - It's not my decision. - I need that cash. If I'm not home within an hour... My wife takes a tape to the police and we're all in deep shit. The boss has seen to that. This the tape? - Where's my wife? - Waiting for you in hell. You bastards! - You want to fight? - Fuckin' asshole! I'll send you to your wife... - Boss. - Attorney Lam, how are we doing? All the contracts are signed but the sauna owner, Mr Cho, is difficult. - What does he want? - To raise the rent. Tell him the rent is no problem. Business is booming. As you wish. I'll get right on it. The loot's been sold but Peter betrayed us. - What did you do? - His family had a car crash. - The whole family killed. - Very good. Thank you, Boss. Let's go. Is it true about Ben? Yes, he saved the life of one of those cop bitches. Leave Hong Kong for the time being. Thanks, boss. Mark, tell Lethal Weapons I want Ben dead. Think they can infiltrate my organization. We'll see about that! The bastard lives in Room C on the tenth floor. We have to be ready for anything. It's a pretty tough layout. Let's check our escape route. Remember the good old days? I had a different girl every week. So why'd you never share them with me, once in a while? - I'm still hungry. - The Bottomless Pit. Good restaurant. Down there is a shopping mall with two restaurants. It's easier to do it here. - I'm not sure. - Don't think we can make it? Just be careful. My god, this job's boring. - This game is exciting but deadly - Sometimes you gotta pay. - What does that mean? - How would you know? You guys have all the fun. - We got this for you. Enjoy. - Hmm, he's a pretty good guy. Freeze. Police! Hold it! Don't move. We work for a film company, they're fake guns! Why so many? Drive on! - What's the charge? - He's an illegal immigrant. You're wasting our time. Identification. Here's my union card. Take a good look. - It's in order. - You can go. We screwed up. What's wrong? Something's eating you. I had to send off more money. The fifth time this month. What's up? My grandmother, who raised me since I was very young... Is very sick. Once this job's over, I'm going to visit her. When this job's over, I'll go with you. You're a good partner... But tomorrow won't be easy. I smell a trap. A trap for guys who once blew up a police station built like Fort Knox?! You took the bullet meant for me. We should sleep now. Set for eight. All this sitting around is driving me crazy. Good morning. Friend, you dropped your cash. That was careless. Should I pick it up? Why not? I'm sick of eating the same dish. Being cooped up is getting to me. - Come on. - Nice meal. - Why is Paul dead? - Because of this case. Look, he's asleep again. Let's trick him. How about it? 1-2-3... Bulletproof?! Hold it! Freeze! Take him alive. Yvonne, be careful! Be careful! I'll be back for breakfast. Special news bulletin: this morning in a shoot out at Lion Rock... Three police officers and their assailant died. We have this report. We wanted him alive... But it was kill or be killed. Bitch! Benjamin died for nothing. We don't even have any leads. Ben did mention a night club... - What's the name? - The Red Heart. - We could check it out. - Good. Now, don't go crazy. Keep your men away from the girls. I'll make sure of that. You don't have to worry. But policemen drive women crazy and these bar girls are alluring. You think they'll seduce our boys? - You want to work or to joke? - Sorry, sir. At least we know the killer's ID. Yes, the son of a farmer. A wanderer most of his life... Not many will mourn him... except his father, of course. He came yesterday and took the body for burial. I can't believe my son is dead. Your brother was very smart. That's what killed him. He went too fast. If he'd been content to be a farmer... He'd be alive. But he wanted to be a big shot with his own business. Instead he's dead. You won't follow in his footsteps, you hear? Daddy, you know I'm not like Larry. Larry, I'll kill that bitch for you. Your ticket's booked. You'd better skip town for a while. After I've killed that bitch. You've fulfilled your contract. I don't want you causing trouble. Listen, Larry completed the hit before he died. Contract closed. But he was my partner. I owe him. - This needn't concern you. - So I'm not your boss?! I owe Larry and it's payback time. A man of honour. - Ten... fifteen... - Alright. - Open, you lose! - Perhaps sir could use another note? - What's the problem? - This bill is counterfeit. Are you accusing me of dishonesty? I want to see the manager. I'm the manager. Was the service not good enough? Check all these notes. If they're good, change them; if not, someone else will take them. Very good, sir. My empire is large but so are my overheads. I can't afford unprofitable activities. However, in your case I'll make an exception but don't get cocky. Come in. - What's this? - They're fake, boss. They're some people outside who look interested in doing business. Good forgeries. Well, should we accept the offer or leave it alone? It's a chance to make money, fool! Alright, I'll negotiate with them. - Five. - Twenty. You win, again. The money's been checked... And there's no doubt that it is counterfeit. We wont take it but we may buy it. - Who is "we"? - Who are you to ask? Forget what I said. I offered you some business but you're too nosey. If you boys don't have money... - Use a credit card or get out. - Okay, no deal. What will you tell the manageress? So you're a wise guy. - Enough jokes. What's your price? - Let's negotiate. - I'm not going. - Stop jerking me around! I spend plenty on you every day. I can buy you anytime. You're just an animal! Excuse me, I'll be right back. - You'll get the cleaning bill. - I'm sorry Mr Cho. We've got lots of girls for you to choose from. Winnie, get lost. Winnie? He molested me. Arrest him. - Arrest? - Boss, they're cops. I'm not afraid of the cops. - It was awful. - There, there. Your money's nothing to the law. Molesting women will land you in jail. You're beautiful when you're angry. The bitch with Winnie killed Larry. - Don't be afraid. We're here. - That fuckin' bitch. Those are cops. If you kill her now we're all in trouble. Larry's dead. I don't give a damn. Can't you wait for revenge? You'll ruin my business. If you'd like, we can keep each other company. Never mix business and pleasure. I agree. I meant company, not sex. I'll wait but not forever. Don't you think my men can handle these women? Would I be boss if they scared me? Harry, you and Dion handle that job on your own. - We'll grab a bite to eat. - I'd like that. - I'm okay now. - Call if you have any trouble. I will. Enjoy your drinks. - Marianne, she's not a virgin. - Stop kidding around. Do you require anything? The bill. No need. I'm to give you these. It's not good Winnie working here. It's a proper job, she can steer clear of trouble. If she's careful. What about our deal? He may fall for it, she won't. - You found out the boss was female. - Just a guess. - But I guessed right. - True. Look. Surprise me, Amy. Do you want to be on the top or the bottom? You'll see. - Look at that jerk. - The guy's a sex maniac. He'll get his. - What's their game? - Looks to me like car thieves. You got it all wrong. We're locked out of the car. Perhaps you need the key? We're cops, suckers. - God, it hurts. - My head. You almost killed me! Tiger? - You're going nowhere. - Fuck you. - Well, we are. Tiger, drive on! - Whatever you say, boss. - Gimme a break. - Forget it. - Hey, come on. - Shut up and get moving. That woman officer shot out my car's rear window while I was inside. I'll refer it to my sergeant for investigation. Don't give me that! You'll have to do better than that or you'll hear from my lawyer. - What's the charge? - Auto theft. Assaulting police officers. That's the lunatic! - He's my witness. She shot at me. - She's the one who tried to kill him. Good. They were apprehended assaulting police officers. Attorney Lam will see to bail. Stop this foolishness or we're in trouble. Don't try my patience. Now, I've examined the facts. - Is there a financial conflict here? - No. - And you? - No. - Any personal trouble between you? - None at all. - Have you seen these men before? - No. Have you seen them before? No, we haven't. So, you've never met and have no financial or personal dealings. As to my clients credentials... They have regular jobs. They're good citizens. This defence is meaningless! You, sir, were attacked? As I said: I saw it all. She nearly killed me. I saw only her reckless gunplay. - That's bullshit. - Who are you threatening? Attorney Lam, take my case. I want to sue her for compensation. - Very good. - Tiger, let's go. - But Attorney Cheung's on his way. - I can't wait. I'm suing for compensation. I'm sure you'll cooperate. Marianne says you should wait. If I stay much longer, I won't fit through the door. They're feeding me to death! I prefer my own diet, I really do. Here's Marianne. - Sorry I'm late. - I almost went home alone. Sorry, but we were working on an important case at the precinct. - You shouldn't discharge yourself. - I hate lying around. It's so boring when there is work to be done, places to see. Rest on a day like this? Never! - Are you hungry? Shall we eat? - Good idea. I have a date so I'll see you later. Don't forget it's dad's birthday soon. I'll remember. Daddy, have a good time. Bye. What a girl! Why are you always in trouble? It's a real mess this time. If they prove these allegations, I'll be held responsible. Marianne, I'm taking you off active duty. I'll do everything I can to help. Now, take off. - Yes, sir. - She fired to defend me. Nevertheless, an investigation has to be conducted. You know procedure. I'll do everything in my power. But, off the record, explain to me how this became such a mess. I'm trained to react, not explain. Read my report. - I'm off for lunch. - Okay. - Seen Marianne? - She left not looking too good. Thanks. - What a wonderful world! - We're free. - Any idea who stood bail? - No. - We're just lucky. - Hey, you! This is police protection, right? - Tax payers need protection. - When did you ever pay tax? - Shh, she'll have us for tax evasion. - That's right. Shut up! - What do you want? - Who put that hit on us? Who bailed us out? Tell us, so we can thank them. - Watch yourselves or expect trouble. - Cool it. - We're bailed. - And innocent. - We're free. - How sweet it is. Bastards! Good swing but your aim was off. The charge is bag-snatching. What's going on here? I'm a police officer. - Need some help? - No, thanks. - You can go. - Yes, Ma'am. - Lam, what's up? - This Mr Cho is ridiculous. We helped him with his assault case. Yet he still hasn't signed. What do you mean? The sauna house operation... he wants to take the property back. Also, he won't renew the leases on the nightclub and bar. - I'll deal with it. - Okay. Lam was discreet... But we still found out who he is working for. - We have no evidence. - Don't worry. We'll use tried and trusted methods. Do you know who I am? You don't frighten me. - I'm the wrong person to cross. - We're going to put you away. So, you're cops. I have a reputation. I won't be intimidated. Dion and Harry told us everything. So, why wait? Arrest me! - We will, sooner or later. - Don't be so sure. - Dion and Harry could be trouble. - We'd better fix them. What about the lady cops? Who knows? Let's get our money from this job and take off. Great! Let's go to Thailand. Dead men can't go anywhere. - You're joking. - Inspecting the construction? We're here to kill you. - He's serious. - Move! Get them! - Are you alright? - I'm okay. - Meet our buddies. - Kill! Let's go! - Those guys are scared shitless. - Nobody fucks with us on our turf. - Why'd they come after us? - We'll speak to Dennis. He'll know what to do. - We're too late. They're dead. - By whose hand? He's not the one we want. Your flight's at eight. Come back in three months. When you return, you can avenge your friend's death. Hello? Hold on. So it's settled. Enjoy your flight. How's it going? I understand. Kidnap Cho and demand 30 million. Sure. I've already iced Dennis' friends. - They're both dead. - Good. - Ten. - Ten. - Fifteen. - Open. Ten... I lose. That's great. Now, I'd like a drink. - What sort? - A cocktail... surprise me. I've got just the thing for you. Splendid. Something tells me we're going to enjoy ourselves. This is called a "Cupid Cocktail". Have a taste. Thanks, honey. That was really something. Delicious. And the shakers aren't bad either! Now, be patient. I've more surprises in store for you. If there's more like this, I'm yours. Do what you like with me. I'm bound to enjoy it! What's the big idea? Not only will you feel high, you'll feel like you're in heaven. Your heart will soar in the sky. - You can really do that? - You'll feel like you're on fire. Do whatever your heart desires. Just don't stop halfway. I'll go all the way, baby. Oh, sweetheart, It's too much. I can't bear it. This is the Red Heart contract. Attorney Lam sent it over. You wouldn't see him so the boss sent me. It's pointless to talk: I won't sign. You drank my "Cupid Cocktail". So if I want you to sign, you will. - Don't threaten me. - I asked nicely but you won't. Now, you've got more trouble than you can handle. Violence won't work. You're in for something new. These guys are blue-movie studs from Hollywood. This one is called "Baldy" and he's insatiable. This one's "Blacky"... otherwise known as "Super Dick". I'm in deep shit! Sign the contract or it's a fate worse than death. I won't sign! Well, in that case, have fun. Take care of him. Help, help! No. Oh god, no! Pretty boy, don't shout. We'll be very nice to you. Hello uncle, sorry I'm late. It's so hot. Why is the air conditioning off? Here, happy birthday. - Cheers. - Toast me with this. All of it? Well, here's to you. All of it? Would sir care to order? I told you not now, so why don't you go away? Certainly, sir. Uncle, it's your birthday. You should be happy. I'm sure the others will be here soon. They're always late. Sorry, I didn't realise the time. Forgive me? Sure. Bottoms up! With these three fingers, I wish you good health and success. That hits the spot. Hasn't Winnie arrived? She didn't want to come. Don't speak like that. You should enjoy your birthday. May I take your order, now? - Whatever. I can't eat anyway. - Okay. - Waiter, we'll wait a little longer. - Of course. I've got a call. I've got to go to the john. I'll be right back. - Yvonne here. - We have an urgent case. Cho's been kidnapped. They want 30 million dollars. - Okay, but who's Cho? - The rich guy who sued Marianne. He deserves it. No backchat, just get back here. - Someone's snatched that guy, Cho. - You'd better go. - You'll miss dad's dinner. - He'll be upset. - I'll explain. - Thanks. See you later. Marianne? You have a call. Who could it be? - Hello? - Expecting Winnie for dinner? She couldn't come tonight. Be at the "haunted house" in Moth Bay in 15 minutes or your sister dies. Come alone. And no tricks. Marianne, help! Tell Dad I'm at the "haunted house" in Moth bay. Winnie's in trouble. Certainly, Miss. - Marianne, help me! - Winnie! Driver, call this number. Ask for Yvonne. She must go to this address. It's life or death. Please do it immediately. Bitch! I finally get even for Larry. Pull over. I need to make a call. - No need, use my mobile. - Thanks. There is a case at the "haunted house". Send someone over. Alright, I got it. - Hey! - Dad, Winnie's inside. Help her! Dad, please help me! Now, take it easy. Daddy's here. Hurry, daddy. For god's sake, hurry! The ice is melting fast. There are so many wires. Hurry, daddy. Don't panic and don't make any sudden movements. The ice is melting! This side... Hurry, daddy, otherwise I won't make it. Hurry, daddy, the ice is melting very fast! - Over here... - Wait, I don't know where to start. I can feel something moving! Turn off the control... This one's going to go... The one on my left... Marianne, get a hold of yourself! My father and sister... There's nothing you can do. - Is this information reliable? - Without a doubt. Where are Marianne's body guards? They've been transferred to the Cho case. He's being held in an old house in Shatin. They have a lot of guns. We needed the firepower. Meanwhile, who guards Marianne? I'm sorry about Marianne. As soon as I can, I'll send back the men. I feel partly responsible. She's lost her entire family. Isn't that enough?! As a man, I feel sympathy for her. But I'm a police officer too. I'm accountable to my superiors. She performs her duty... And ends up at risk, unguarded. Whilst every available man is used to rescue that scumbag, Cho! I won't do it. You realise that disobeying orders means certain punishment? Yeah, and probable dismissal. So I quit. - Yvonne, you're too impulsive. - Stop right there. I'm not impulsive, I'm through. Yvonne! Sorry, no refunds. I don't want to return them. On the contrary, I'd like some more. Of course. - Can you send them to the hospital? - It'll cost extra. - Which room in which hospital? - I'll write it down. - Who are you? - Flower lady. Oh, shit. Marianne! - We've found Marianne's killer. - We'll waste him. No. I'll deal with it... I don't want you involved. I did what I vowed, Larry. I killed the bitch that got you. It's a pity that you won't be coming with me to see grandma. When this job is over, I'll go with you. You're a good partner... But tomorrow won't be easy. I smell a trap. A trap for guys who once blew up a police station built like Fort Knox?! You took the bullet meant for me. Good friend, don't worry, I carry you in my heart. Place your soul in this incense, and we'll visit grandma together. I warned you but you didn't listen. Disobedience means death. Larry, maybe I won't be visiting grandma either. - Okay, if I put this on the altar? - No way, motherfucker. I took a bullet for you once, now I have taken two more. You were the best buddy a guy could have. How could I forget you? We'll be together in the next life. Kill him now. I want you to die slowly. Now, go!
