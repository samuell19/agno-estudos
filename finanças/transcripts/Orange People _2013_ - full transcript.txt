Zohara, your mama wants you to come quickly! Bye. Pour. Mama, it's too hot, it's too hot. Let go of me. Hey! Don't act so spoiled! What'll your future husband say if he comes and sees you can't pour tea? My future husband? What, Makhluf? Makhluf! Come here. - Orange People - A fiIm by Hanna Azulay Hasfari It's not working. Maybe you should try again. - I'm telling you, it's not working. I'm sorry, it's not working with the watch. Come back some other time. But we're getting married in two days. Tell her we're getting married in two days. Give her something that's closer to your body, like a piece of clothing. Or come back some other time. Thank you, let's go. Ortal. Ortal, what are you doing? Ortal. Good morning. - Good morning. She'll sleep for a few minutes, in the meantime you can admire the view. If she doesn't fall asleep, that works best. Then why does she ask for personal items? That way they believe it works. It's more "authentic." Are you coming? - Okay. Translate what Grandma says, word for word, no fooling around. Remember, they're paying good money for her advice. What's the hurry? - No hurry. I was supposed to be at an investigation, instead I'm your chauffeur. I'd love to get a license, you know. - Are you getting out? I take my pills, remember? I don't trust those pills. - Stop it, I won't fall asleep. What's with you? Okay, c'mon, the criminals are waiting for me. She's from Ouarzazate. You, your family is from Ouarzazate. He's from Tangier. Tangier, sweet Tangier! My grandma comes from Tangier. - So do I. It's right on the coast. - There's a port. -Colorful houses. And... Grandma? His family, Senouf, they made sugar and sold it to her family. Your family, Senouf? - Yeah, Senouf. They used to sell sugar to your family. Seriously? Tell her to get away from him. He'll give her hell. What did she say? She said that if he gives you a hard time... come back to see her. On your own. What does she mean, a hard time? That's what she said. Can I get a receipt? - Sure. Who should I write it out to? - Nachmias Construction. Thank you. Do I give you a hard time? - No, but you're always yelling at me. Me? Yell? Get your ass in the car. 600 shekels and we didn't even get to see her fall asleep. 400. Should I let more people in? I'm tired. What's with you today, Grandma? Makhluf! Move it. Want me to stay with you? Go to school. Give me a puff. Just a little one. Fine! Zohar. Tangerine, wait up! Believe me, your final paper can be a great experience. Who knows, maybe one day, one of you will thank me when he receives the Nobel Prize, and I know it won't be you, Zohar. - What? Will Zohar please tell us what topic she chose for her paper? I thought of exploring who I inherited my orange skin color from. I see. And it doesn't bother you that I repeatedly said not to write a paper on personal matters? We must maintain scientific objectivity. I told her. How about you, my friend, Mr. Ohayon? Have you chosen a topic or are you still busy harassing Miss Hajaj? Yes I have. I'm going to research if evil is an individual trait, or if it's in the DNA of all Moroccan descendants. Hi Simone, I want the usual, five schnitzels with a side dish, can I pick it up at 2:00? - At 1:30, I have to be at my mother's by 2:00. What are they opening up across the street? A butcher shop, I think. - Good morning. Simone, give me spaghetti and meatballs today, the kids are sick of mashed potatoes. What is that over there? - A butcher shop. A butcher shop? Cool. Marina, you need a moustache wax. Come see me, same price. Bye, Simone. - Bye, Simone. You don't need the restaurant anymore. I don't feel well, Simone. Soon there won't be anyone left to dream for them. I'll be gone soon. You've been saying that for as long as I can remember. This time I know it. - Stop it, Mama. My shadow is getting smaller. - Stop it! Is this how Jackie likes it? You'll end up a dreamer, mark my words. Where's Jackie? - He went back to the precinct. What about the couscous? - Not that again! Call him. - I don't want to! Just dial his number. Here, I'll talk to him. I'm hungry. Dial! Where are you? The criminals aren't going anywhere. Who do you think I cook for? One word from her and you're pulling out weeds from the dead? She asked me to plant some flowers instead of the ones that died. So what if she asked? What veggies should I plant here, carrots or pumpkins? It's a cemetery, Jackie! 200 years old. So fruit would be more appropriate? Stop it, don't make me laugh. Stop it! Stop it! Don't make me laugh. Okay, okay, enough, enough. Okay. Why do you think everyone calls me Tangerine? This color is unusual. Because you're Moroccan, like candy, like a shebakia cookie, understand? Your butt is naked, watch out for flies. Your butt is naked, watch out for flies. Okay, that's enough. - Fine. I can't write a paper about myself anyway. What a chatterbox... It's so hot. I know! I'll write a paper about you. I'd like to explore what happens in your head when you dream. You think He's something that can be explored? If someone gives you a gift, be grateful and pass it on to the next generation. - Pass it on then. You devil. Besides, if you want to know, you have to dream yourself. Okay, fine. - Understand what I'm saying? Makhluf! Makhluf... Makhluf... Gotcha, you bastard! Don't move! Here, give me that. Believe me, I only married Simone because of you. I saw you and knew what my wife would look like when she got old. I mean it. Come on, Grandma looks more like Mom's big sister. Hi, hi, hi. - Hi, hi, hi. Why? How old are you? 54, 55 at the most. -I don't know. They didn't write it down in Morocco in my day. Hold on, how old were you when you had a baby? Let me think... 11, 12, 13. 13, 14, maybe. I don't know. - Then I was right. You should be 54 or 55. 58, tops. No way. She had us when she was older. She's over 60. "Us"? Oh, you're referring to her. - Zohar, pass me the salad. Dad, whenever I ask about Aunt Fanny, you ask me to pass the salad. Is that some kind of Pavlovian reaction? Wait, do you have another child? Where did he disappear to? A boy or a girl? A girl. Why don't you teach Simone how to make couscous? What for? anyway, she can't cook. If she closes down the restaurant... You know she's a great dreamer. She'll have money flowing out of her fingers. I don't know, Zohara. You shouldn't have given her money for that restaurant in the first place. What could I do? She kept nagging me. You're just being stubborn. I check her eyes every night, they don't move. -It's the pills. - Zohara, she doesn't want to dream. Who will dream then? My dreams are no good. I wake up all nervous. That's because you're not getting any younger. Ow! This isn't the best neighborhood. And you live next to dead people. And they never bother me like the living do. You should go visit the grave of Rabbi Amram Ben Diwan in Morocco. To this day the Muslims live in the Jewish cemetery and watch over them. Did any harm come to them? Why not move to Bat Yam? Why Bat Yam? Your granddaughter's school, your daughter's restaurant. Everyone's moving there. We could live in a penthouse. A penthouse? Go on, get up. A penthouse... This is my home. Look at these tiles. Like my home in Tangier. What's that? - It's medicinal. For my headaches. Makhluf and my mother came to me in my dream today. First time ever. I don't have much time left. What does that mean? - Never mind. Talk to her. If she starts dreaming again, she'll get all crazy with the cleaning again. I don't think so. Go on. Got a second, Dad? Not really. - Fine, forget about it. -What? Mom with her restaurant, you with your criminals and me, alone in this world. - What? -An orphan. One minute, otherwise I'm sending you to boarding school. I'm doing a biology paper on the brain and dreams. Can you tell me about Mom and Grandma's illness? Don't you care what happens in their brains when they dream? First of all, Mom is on medication. - What kind? Ritalin and Provigil. What difference does it make? Most of the time she can't fall asleep. Second, I don't think you should be delving into this. Bye. Thank God for the Internet! How are you, Jackie? Fanny? We were just talking about you. Very funny. Wow. What? Have I changed that much? - I don't know. You never used to have wrinkles. You didn't have any gray hair either. Actually, seeing you in the light, you only have wrinkles around your big mouth. My plane just landed. I couldn't wait so I came right over. You waited for 16 years. But I never had to pee this bad in 16 years. May I? Where's the bathroom? - Here. -Oh. When did you remodel? - Right after Zohar was born. Zohar? My mother must be happy. Hardly. We didn't name her Zohara. Of course. If you don't want your mother to know you're here... She got old too. Is that Zohar? Why are you here, Fanny? I'm asking myself the same question. Touche. Your button's undone. Where's Simone? Sleeping, she has to get up early to open her restaurant. - Restaurant? I see I have a lot of catching up to do. Wake her up. Come on, I miss her. I have to ask her first. She's still mad at you. She's mad at me, huh? Where did you run off to? Paris. I have a restaurant too. But I got fed up so I shut it down for a few months and traveled. I've just come from Thailand. On your way back to Paris? I'm here for now. Where are you staying? On the couch, for all I care. You know what I mean, which hotel? You don't call, I just show up. Bye. I dreamt about Fanny. God bless you. Thank you very much. You are Zohara, daughter of Masuda Ben Shitrit and you are Makhluf, son of Ya'akov Turgeman. Take it off. Mama, I don't want to get married, please. Mama, I don't want to get married. Mama, I don't want to get married. I don't want to get married... I don't want to get married... I don't want to get married... Zohara? Where are you, my darling? Are you hiding from me? Come to me. Zohara. Zohara. Come now, where are you? Gotcha! Aren't you late already? There used to be a hospital here. Donolo A and Donolo B. Now it's all changed. I remember that night at your grandpa Jarboua's restaurant. It was a long, long time ago. He sold out and left, may he rest in peace. Good morning to our neighbor Zohara. Good morning. Who are they? - Relatives of mine from Nablus. After hearing all their parents' stories about Jaffa and its beaches they wanted to see for themselves. I have to go because they can't swim. Bye. The disease is called narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, a sudden urge to sleep with a direct transition to dreams. These are a few examples I got off YouTube. Hi, you're gonna meet my sister, she's narcoleptic. Sharon. - Hi. -Hi. A narcoleptic's life is very hard, they don't leave the house if they can help it. They injure themselves when they fall. They try not to laugh, not to be happy or get excited. Your grandmother has narcolepsy, doesn't she? -I guess so. So could you have it too? - No way. I don't even dream. My mom says my eyelids never move. First find out whether you have a personal connection to this disorder. Then I'll decide whether to approve it or not. Cool. Well? Move out of my way. I'm telling you I saw her! - You think she's here and didn't come see us? You must be imagining it. Maybe it's all those pills. Jackie! -Then something must be bothering you about her, because since last night you can't stop dreaming and talking about her! I have to get to the precinct. Where are we going? Out of Bat Yam. The last thing I need is for Simone to see us. Is that any way to catch her off guard? You want her to fall asleep in front of her customers? I just want to see my sister and meet my niece, relax. But she doesn't want to see you, don't you understand? Stop the car. -What are you doing? - Stop the car! Get in the car, I'll take you back to the hotel. I'll walk. -You can't walk, we're in Ashdod. Then I'll take a taxi. Your purse is in the car. You're acting like a child. - What are you afraid of? You should talk to your mother. What for? So she can say, "Hello, whore, what are you doing here?" You're still crazy, huh? I'd appreciate if you'd stay away from her. Jackie! Jackie! She's sleeping on our couch. Is it her? Is it her?! Jackie, before I lose my mind! - Yes, yes, it's her. What? How did she get in? She was here last night too. Last night? She wanted to wake you up so I said I should ask you first, I don't feel a thing. Can you get me a glass of water? Excuse me! You're sleeping on my couch and I have to clean it. -Simone. Tell this thing to get out of my house. Simone, I'm sorry, I thought you... -Get out. You liar. Go! I ordered without the sauce. - I already poured, Mano. What do I care? You should watch your language if you want to get service. What are you doing here? - I just want to help. I don't need your help. Go away. Go away. - What's wrong with you? Go away! Go! - Stop it! What do you want, Fanny? To help you out of the mess with the deli across the street. Mess? A top quality Russian deli versus... What is this? Coleslaw? Corn niblets and red pepper? Stringy spaghetti? None of your business. I can help you, Lulu. What do you say? That only I do the cooking here and I don't like you calling me Lulu. You won't make it without me. You never cooked like this. Who taught you? A Thai woman. She used to stand behind me... Come here. She taught me how to dance with the food. How to chop onions, how much salt to use, to taste the food with my finger, just like this. Taste it. - Enough. Simone, why does your restaurant look like this? Listen, that dumbass chef at the deli across the street has the same meat, same tomatoes, same pepper, but he treats them with respect. Have you seen how he fixed up the place? Are you crazy or what? Why take an interest in me after all these years? I always took an interest, I just didn't get around to coming by. You didn't get around to coming by? - Right. You didn't get around to coming by?! - No. I'm your sister, you idiot! One day you just got up severed my body in two and vanished into thin air! No phone call, no email, no postcard, I thought you were dead! But it never occurred to me that you just didn't get around to coming by! Get away from me, you... Why are you here? What do you want from me? -Nothing. Really. Wait... I'll tell you, but... it'll sound stupid. - I'm going to scream. -No, don't! The night before my flight from Thailand to Paris, I got this feeling that you really need me. That you're in danger or something. - What a load of crap. That's what I felt, that's why I came, I swear on the kids. - You have kids? -You think? Idiot. Are you married? - What for? -Is there a man? Can we not talk about everything now? - No. I want to know everything, including why you disappeared. But I can't tell you everything. - Then goodbye. Give me a few days. Please. It took me years to get over it. I won't let you ruin it. - I won't. I won't let you. - I said I won't. Can we cook together tomorrow? Thank you. Grandma, did you check my eyes last night? Excuse me, Ms. Zohara, may I? This is the third time. My daughter is very sick. I just want to know what side of the family the disease comes from. Please. Give me your bra. Here. Come here. - What? -Sit down. Hold this. - Grandma! -Hold it tight. Now close your eyes. - What? -Close your eyes! Now sleep. - But Grandma... -Sleep! Grandma, I'm late for school! Go on, get outta here, go. I don't need any of you. Go on, go! Go! Go! Go! These clothes are no good. Here is a sign of her virginity This is his morning The salt and grace are with him Here is her virginity Above me, not below! Good morning. What's this? - This? Sirloin for roast beef. Veal ossobuco from an organic farm up north. I'm making couscous. - From a bag? What am I, a chump like Mom? It's great couscous. I'm suggesting you make your own ossobuco. Leave me alone, alright? Then I'll make it, just tell me how. If you still remember... Write down what I say or you won't remember. Fanny, it's burning! Get me the oil, quick! Here's the oil. Not corn oil, olive oil! Down there! Give me some onion. Garlic. Carrots. Celery root. Lemon zest. Tomatoes. I said tomatoes. I'm hot. What was that you gave me to drink? Simone? Simone? Tell me why you stopped cooking like that and I'll leave you alone. What's the point? Mom won't be able to dream soon. You bought that nonsense about her shadow getting smaller? I saw it myself. Simone, this is the 21st century. Who will take over for her? - Your grandma's grandmother. Who cares? - I care. Ever since I can remember she's been saying, "You'll be a dreamer, you'll be a dreamer." And I know she's right. - How? -I just do. I can feel it. What good will ossobuco do? Let me make schnitzels and sloppy spaghetti, just as long as I can get out of the house. Just as long as I don't fall asleep 5 times a day and wake up with bruises all over my body. Do you know how great it is to get out of my sweat suit, dress up, go to work and just talk to people? I missed you so much, Lala. How small is Mom's shadow? Lulu? It could take a day, it could take a month. Hello, whore. What are you doing here? I thought you might miss me. I miss you so much that I can't fall asleep. By the look of the renovations, I'd say you're dreaming real well. Believe me, I'd take over for you in a heartbeat, but unfortunately, I haven't contracted the disease. I asked what you're doing here. Simone needs me. She'll have to close down the restaurant. Good. You still insist that she take over for you? I'm warning you, Fanny. If you don't go back to your whorehouse in Paris... What? -I'll tell Simone why you really disappeared. I can tell Simone why I disappeared too. I missed this morning's flight. I think I'll have to stay at least until after Rosh Hashana. That's some tan, Mama. A woman your age... How embarrassing. "Simone's ossobuco, roast beef and lots more at crazy prices!" Look at her. I've been making schnitzels for her kids all year and she betrays me. Bitch. Hi! How are you? Are you mad at me? For going over there? - You're free to go wherever you like. What is that? - It's pasta, roast beef, ossobuco and salmon. Italian cuisine. - Italian? This is Fanny. A chef from Paris. Hi! - Hi. The kids have been driving me nuts all day. All they want is schnitzels. What, no schnitzels? What kind of food is this? - Italian. -Taste it. Hi, I'm Fanny. Chef from Paris. -Paris? Ooh-la-la! - Voila. It's delicious... but it's not... what I'm looking for. What? -She's right. It's not what we're looking for. That's it, I'm closing. - Closing what? The restaurant. There's no point. What? He wants me to work for him. - What? He wants me to cut the vegetables for his pirozhki. -The nerve. Listen to me, you're not shutting down. Put the dishes back, I'm bringing the food. Why are you laughing? Because I'll never beat that Russian. I need my own specialty. Sure you do. Where will you get your own specialty? Your mother? Just tell me what you put in the couscous. I said I'm not telling. Start dreaming again, I'll tell you. Mom, I want to remodel the restaurant and cook. -Remodel? I need money. There is no money. This is a gift for Zohar, and this goes with me to my grave. I used to be able to do it. Happy birthday. - Thank you. Happy birthday. What do you think about your wife remodeling the restaurant? What? Remodeling, now? Your wife's unstable, what do you want from me? Did she fall asleep again? - Just once. But when she woke up she started cooking like crazy. Since I got back I can't stop feeling excited. Stop it. Don't you ever long for it? For my wife. I long for my wife. You have your wife every night. What good does that do me? For the past few months I don't know what's wrong with her. Shall we head back? Your omelet is ready. Bring it to the living room. - No. I'm sick of cleaning up after you. Fuck this. I don't want to eat. He's about to score a goal, move. - Who did I make it for? Tum it back on. - No. Tum it on, you crazy woman! - No. -Turn it on. -No! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Will this madness ever end? Last year it was the restaurant, now the remodeling? Look! Look! All you have to do is shut down the restaurant and take over for your mother. I don't want to take over for her. - Why not? -Because! I don't want to make crazy movements with my eyes and wake up covered in sweat as if I was in hell. What's with you, Jackie? All I want to do is cook in my little restaurant. Look at the state you're in. I'm going on night duty now. When I get back in the morning, I'm shutting down the restaurant. You hear me? Grandma? - Yes, my love. Do you remember the first time you fell asleep? Of course I do, why? - It's for my paper on dreams. When that jerk Makhluf was with me the first time. -Makhluf? Your first husband? - Damn him. But what do you mean, "the first time"? Don't you know what "first time" means? What did I want, after all? Just to play on the swings and have my mother by my side. - What did you say? But I got pregnant. May God punish him. What he did to me after that... Papa came to me in my dream and said you should give me milk and honey. Where am I going to get milk and honey for you now? Here, nurse her. - No, I want milk and honey. Mama! I want milk and honey. I want milk and honey. I want milk and honey. I want milk and honey. Enough! Take this baby and this baby's baby and get out of here! I need a wife, not a little girl! Tomorrow I'm going to the Baba Sali to divorce her. That's it! Quiet! I'll be right out, Guy. What kind of skirt is that? - Mom bought it for me for my birthday. Your legs are naked like a whore. - Grandma! Fine, go. I thought you'd turn out golden, but you also turned out like sand. I'm sorry, Grandma, the disease doesn't always run in the family. Disease? - What? No. Disease? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. Disease. Get out of here. Get out of here. - What? But I didn't mean to say disease. I'm sorry. -Get out of here. Grandma, what's with you? - Get out of here! Get out of here! All of you! Damn all of you! What is this? Where am I? I've never been down here. My home in Tangier. You like it? What are you doing here? You said you'd tell me what you put in the couscous. -Ah... Gold. I put gold in the couscous. Gold? You put gold in the couscous? Yes, my daughter. I've been putting gold in your couscous my entire life, but you all remain sand. I put all the gold my mother gave me in the couscous. Necklaces, bracelets, earrings, I made them into leaves and ground them extremely fine. This is the last one. Now go away. - What? Go away, I said. What are you doing with my kskas? Come back here. Give me my kskas. Give me my kskas. Give me my kskas. It's mine! What is this? What did you put in my kskas? Couscous, I made it. - Couscous? But you don't know how to make couscous. You don't know how to make anything. You call this couscous? This is cat litter. But it's delicious, taste it. Give it to me. Give it back. - Let go of my kskas. Give it to me. - Let go, what are you doing? What are you doing? - Come here. What? -Come here. - What? -Come here. Taste it. -What? - Taste it. Taste it! It's good, isn't it? Isn't it? Here, eat it, so you won't be hungry. More! More! More! More! More! The house is so tidy. What is it? - My mother. What about your mother? - I had a dream. What? Calm down. - Dad! My mother! - Mom! It's Grandma, come quick! You and your dreams... What did you dream about? I don't remember. Only that something awful happened to her. There you are. - What? Good thing you came, I have to go to the restaurant. The restaurant? Now? I've been here for 3 days and her condition's the same. What else can I do? - Stay with her, she's your mother. She's like this because of you. Excuse me? Because you don't want to take over for her. She was so upset and you couldn't care less if we don't have what to eat. Why did you hit me, you lunatic? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. - Leave me alone! I'm so sorry. - Go, go to your ugly restaurant. I'm sorry. Look at you. It's been two days since you got any attention. One year, but who's counting. And the 15 years I stayed home and made schnitzels for you don't count for anything? Keep an eye on her. Grandma... Wake up... Wake up... Hello. Are you Zohar? -Yes. - Nice to meet you. I'm Fanny. Your father told me a lot about you. Do you know him from work? He's family. I'm his sister-in-law. Fanny... Fanny? Aunt Fanny? Fanny. -Fuck! Fanny? - Fanny, yes. Do I look like your mother? No... Yes and no... I don't know. So, how is she? Not so great, huh? You came to keep an eye on her? To be honest, no. I came because I thought my niece would like to get to know her aunt. Only if her aunt wants to get to know her niece. As far as I know her, she's very curious. That's why she never visited before? Because she wasn't so welcome here. -Why? Basically, because she always does what she wants and not what she wants. Can you be more specific? More specific is none of your business. Why, did you have an affair with my dad? Whoa, that's some mouth on you. Be careful, it'll give you wrinkles. That's what they told you? When they tell you nothing you start imagining. So you think you're in a Hollywood movie? More like a French movie. Shut up. Now I can tell you're Mom's sister. What are you doing? Looking for my mother's recipe for stuffed pigeon. Your mother's in a coma. - Don't you start in on me. You know you're playing with fire? And I'm enjoying every minute of it. She's totally changed. What did you do to her? Nothing. Why did you come back? Don't you know? Come with me to Paris. Stay away from me, Fanny. You came alone to my hotel room to tell me to stay away from you? And from her. Why not? Are those the pigeons? And these are the ingredients for the stuffing. Figs, prunes, onions, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon. I want my little daughter. What? I want my little daughter. So, Fanny, why is there no man in your life? There were. Someone new every few years. Why? Parce que l'amour... should be made in Hebrew. Look at that. We really should open a restaurant together. As if Jackie and Mom will let us. They'll do everything they can to stop us just like they did then. What are you talking about? Why did I disappear in the midst of remodeling the restaurant we'd been dreaming of for years? You tell me. Because our crazy mother decided that since I convinced you not to dream, we didn't deserve a restaurant and she stopped paying the contractor. And Jackie decided it's not a good idea because you were pregnant with Zohar. Why didn't you tell me? Mom threatened to tell you that... that I was sleeping with Jackie. What? I was sure she had told you and that you believed her nonsense. She didn't tell me. No? - No. Come to Paris with me. What will I do in Paris? Come on, Simone, be spontaneous for a change. Spontaneous? I have a daughter, a husband, an elderly mother. -Mother? Didn't you hear what I just said? - I heard you. But I must say in her defense that she never told me about you and Jackie. But if she had, I would've believed her. Okay, listen... On the other hand, had I known, I would've killed you and Jackie. Wait, not you, because you went traipsing around the world while I took care of Mom who died when she got to this country and has been living in a cemetery ever since. -Stop it. Why did you come here, Fanny? Tell me the truth. Leave me alone. All of you, leave me alone. "Why did you come? Why did you come?" I came because... I felt like it, okay? You came to take Jackie away, didn't you? Didn't you? Now get the hell out of here. I never want to see you again. Idiot. I want my little daughter. Where is she? Where's my little daughter? My little daughter! My little daughter! My little daughter! Where did I leave her? Where did I leave my little daughter? My little daughter! Mama? Mama. I came to tell you I'm going back to Paris, like you wanted me to. My little daughter! Mama. Mama! I don't think she can hear you. My little daughter! The truth is... I came to tell her how much I hate her. She wasn't very nice to me. But I can't. My little daughter! My little daughter! Look at her beautiful hands. You better visit me in Paris, you hear me? What will you do in Tangier? Let's go! More. Okay, let's go! Goodbye, Mama. My little daughter! My little daughter! Mama, I'm here. - Where is she? Where is she? My little daughter! - How long has she been like this? What does she want? - My little daughter! She keeps dreaming about her daughter she left with her mother. Believe me, I don't even know if there is a daughter. I didn't see her since I left for Tangier. I was told my mother didn't take good care of her and she died. I miss her. I always miss her. I'm hungry. Who made this? I did. What did you put in it? Believe me, Mama, I only feed you gold. Is it good? Give it to me. Fanny? Tum around. Wake up! What is it? I think I'm pregnant. Make an order. Mom. - Yes, my darling. Two servings with all the trimmings. Coming right up. Did I say it right? - Perfect. Here you go, sweetie. I like what you did to your grandma's house. Thank you, have you been here before? Many times. Your grandmother often dreamt for me, don't you remember? She didn't feel well the last time but she always helped me very much. How about you? - I'm helping my parents out. Aren't you going to take over for your grandmother? I don't think I have the knack. I'm taking a different route, I'm studying fiIm. You are? That's a shame. - Yes, it is. Go on, taste it. This is his first time. I can tell. Enjoy. - Thanks. "Couscous With Gold Lulu and Lala's Restaurant"
