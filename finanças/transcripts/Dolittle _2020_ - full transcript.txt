There once was a peculiar doctor known for his extraordinary ability. He could talk to animals. Doctor Dolittle's reputation spread far and wide. Even the Queen of England called on him. So grateful for his help she gifted him a wondrous sanctuary whose doors were opened to all creatures. His days belonged to the animals, but his heart belonged to one woman. Lily the Fearless Explorer. They traveled the globe going on great adventures. Defending creatures who could not defend themselves. They made an extraordinary team. Soon, that team became a family. With Lily by his side Dolittle never felt more alive. Until one day she left on an adventure. Lily died at sea. Heartbroken he locked the gates of the manor and completely retreated from the world. As for me, and the animals whose lives he'd saved, we were left to wonder, could anyone save his? Until one morning, a most unlikely creature found its way to Dolittle's life. A very special boy. In a time when people thought of animals only as possessions, food, or sport. Take that one. Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! - I don't know, I can't. - Shoot! Shoot! You can't keep missing on purpose. Oh, look! There is something that died. Oh, no. We have to help him. You don't leave an animal in suffering. Do you? He's a very odd boy. Follow Poly. Home of Doctor John and Lily Dolittle. We treat all animals-- Follow Poly. Secret entrance. Poly, where'd you go? Good dog. Big, white-- It's no good. As far as I'm concerned, I'm the only human here. Just ignore them. There's no getting past the Kalahari snare, it's an ingenious design. I think you just caught yourself a boy. Let me see. Wait, I don't wanna see. Just make it go away! Deep breathes, Doc. Dab-Dab's got your back. Don't be afraid, John. It's just a boy. This is an opportunity. This ignites me! Pardon me. Whatever you're doing up there? I come from Buckingham Palace on urgent business. Can you tell me if this is the home of John Dolittle? Who are you? You may call me Lady Rose. And you are..? Stubbins. Could you... help me down? This goes against Dolittle's rules. Why are humans against the rules again? If you let humans too close you'll get hurt more than you would if you didn't let them at all. Isn't that right, Doc? That's enough everybody. Back to our routine! We have a very fully-- John, pull yourself together! You can't ignore people just because they're... people. What if they need help? Possum, play dead. This is ridiculous. Chee-Chee, will you answer the door? You're the only one with arms. I think chess was enough pressure for one day. Chee-Chee boy. This is what we trained for. Be brave and get to the door. And don't forget your mantra. I am not a prisoner of fear? You are not a prisoner of fear. Have you been here before? The Queen told me all about it. It's the most unusual place. I'm prepared for anything. Wonderful! A gorilla answering the door. Just as the Queen said. Wait a minute. I have an injured squirrel. I should've never let you go. Hello? Oh, look at you! Aren't you peculiar posing as a twig? Go away please! This is my hiding spot. Not here. Are you alright down there? Yeah. I'm fine. Go on. - Doctor Dolittle. - Yeah, right. You have been summoned to Buckingham Palace by the Queen herself. Go on. You should know. She's fallen gravely ill. Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I'm saying? Go... on. Go on and be gone! I don't care about anyone, anything anywhere anymore. The birds will show you out. Great. Everything's ready. Lunch will be served in a minute now. - Smells lovely, Doc. - Thanks very much. Hey Doc, save some for us this time. Sorry, Doc. Guess I'm scared of kids, too. Don't worry about that. Come on. Let's eat. For that we'll be offering today a broccoli soup. You'll never believe what we caught in the net. The Queen has asked for you by name, sir. Are you hard to hear then? I told you I'm closed for business. What business? Treating humans. Intruder alert! - Don't worry, I'm fine. - Well, I'm not! My house is descended into chaos. - Is it yours? - I don't own anybody. Yoshi had an issue that he came to me with. He's always cold. I have an injured squirrel. I don't know what to do. How was he injured. - I shot him - Wha-- I can't hear you. I shot him, but it was an accident. Of course! An accidental firing upon. Humans never change. He's very hurt. Please help him. Take that. And this. I'm too beautiful to die. Yes? He's with us. Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps. Disinfect the surgery. You will not tend to a squirrel while the Queen of England's life hangs in the balance! You don't me very well, do you? Don't drop him. We have a code red. Code red. Code red everybody. The Doctor is back! Hang on, little buddy. Haven't done this in a while. Let's get everything the way Doc likes. Don't worry, we got you, pal. Presume to save this squirrel, shall we? Okay. You're awake? Everything will be fine. If I die I swear I will hunt your house. Sterilise the scalpel, do not lick any instrument-- Patient's condition is stabilised. They are understanding human, he's understanding them. In their own languages. Going through the left ventricle. Breathe! Dab-Dab, forceps please. Here you go. That's a piece of celery. Forceps, Doctor. - Sorry. Here you go. - Still, celery. - Forceps? - Carrot. - Forceps? - That's a different piece of celery. - Got it. Forceps. - No. Still celery. Never mind. I'll get it myself. A human talks to the animals? Chee-Chee, brow. My brow as well. --- Right. Sorry. I'm going to come here and be Dolittle's apprentice. Her Majesty has designated this land in nature preserve. If she dies... the deed will be owned by the Treasury, and this place goes away. Shut down? There you are. Still got it, Doc. There, Cheech. That's the spot. Keep an eye on Kevin, should we? He may be prickly when the anesthetic wears off. Revenge! Okay. Okay. Enough with the pampering. You need to go and help the Queen. There are things I no longer do: work with humans, or leave the house-- - Or bathe. - Exercise. Express emotional vulnerability. Wake up, John! If the Queen dies, the Treasury takes the deed. And we'll lose this house. You're talking out of your tail feathers, Poly. The deed was for life. The last time I checked I was very much alive. The Queen's life, John. Not yours. Look at that. It just rolls off the back. I knew I shouldn't've let monkeys proofread the contract. Elliot, Elsie, you are fired! It gets worse. We'll be thrown out of the gates right in the middle of hunting season! What?! - No, no. Breathe, Chee-Chee. We will be kicked out if the Queen dies? - We gonna be hunted. - Calm down. Look at the state of him now! Fear not. I have an inn at Regent Park Zoo. Everyone pack your bags! You help the Queen or we are leaving! You are bluffing! Don't make me count. Don't make me count. - One. - Three. Two... Alright! I'll do it. Let's get you ready to go, honey. - I'll go as I am. - Not looking like that. - I'll just grab my doctor's bag. - Get him! Hold still now. Get your paws off me! This isn't gonna hurt a bit. - Let's clean him up. - How dare you! - Hey guys. - Arthur? - How long have you been living in there? - I don't know. What year is it? Dab-Dab got the razor. That's still celery. Nighty night, Doc. Dolittle used to travel around the world. Look. Ravaging through my private projects? How is he? First things first. The squirrel's name is Kevin. Expect the full recovery. And after some violent grooming, it's been decided. We will come to you, to Buckingham Palace after all. You are going back to whatever burrow you emerged from. Try not to shoot anything on your way. Maybe, I should stay here. I don't do well in crowds. We'll look after you, Cheech. But we all going together, just like the old days. Don't forget that forceps. That's a leek, Dab-Dab. Sure it is. Sticks. Where are you? So, would you care to come along? I know. I had other plans as well. Hurry up. Hurry up. Prepare my ride. Today is gonna be a good day. I'm gonna do nothing, just prance around, pick my own thoughts. We're not at Great Sign. He's got no beard, he looks motivated. Plimpton, don't be alarmed. People only say that when they are about to be alarming. Sorry about this. And sorry about that. - Alright. - I'm unavailable. Unavailable for the man who changed your life? We're going to save the Queen, bro. I am not your bro! You should be an Eskimos rag by now. Out claws! Big claws. Now now, Gentlemen. You're getting a ride. Why are you riding me? There're like four horses in front of us. Cheer up, angry bird, kick back and enjoy the ride. I am the ride! Buckingham Palace. We hit the big time. Full speed no longer required! Welcome home, milady. Guards! Guards! Your Ladyship, Rose. They are the Queen's own guests. Treat them accordingly. You better give me some wide berth. Big way, boys. Plimpton! - Don't! Stop! - Don't stop? - Alright, decision affirmative. - Stop! Can't see! Oh my God! Okay. I bless the hat. Doctor MÃ¼dfly. Lord Badgley. I come from the House of Lords. There is great concern for Her Majesty's health. I shall continue to leech, to circulate the vapors in the blood stream. She'll be lucky to last the week. This is not the first time Dr. Dolittle's been here. You got a dying Queen? Not for long. Doctor Dolittle is in the... Wait. Wait for me. A stowaway, milady. Who claims to be-- Doctor Dolittle's apprentice. It's quite alright, Gareth. But if he was my apprentice, he should fetch my bags and keep his gob shot. Animals in the Queen's chamber? I demand their immediate remov-- Lady Rose, my apologies. Please forgive me. I didn't realise that you were a part of... John Dolittle. - Is that Blein? - Blair. - Pootling? - No. - ---? - No. - With an u-umlaut. - Yes. - From the German. - Of course, from the Germans. Why is he here? Her Majesty has personally requested Doctor Dolittle. Let's get to work. Alright, Jip, give her a good sniff. You alright, fellow? Something smelled wrong. And that's coming from a guy who loves the smell of butts. You do love butt. I detected a whiff of something else. Floral with --- I'm perplexed, Doc. I've never smelt anything like it before. Jipsy and I have developed doubts. May we consult? Of course, I'd be more than happy to help illumining... John and I were students at Edinburgh years ago. Some thought he had a gift for observation. Sorry about that, Mini. Stay here. Dab-Dab, clear up the humans. Boyo, fetch for botanic index, and the tea tin. Everyone out! Few obscene words coming out of my bill. What do you smell, Jip? Aldigareceae? Amoque? Negative? Negative. Aye aye. What are you about, Dolittle? Could possibly the answer to everything. Exposure-- But he was like this in school. Leaning, leaning... I'm saying something interesting. I am interested. The Queen symptoms are due to the effect of a rare Sumatran plant known as the Nightshade flower. A solar eclipse will occur on the 17th of this very month. If she is not received the antidote by then, she will perish. Is that a Turner? Must be. What a fine painting. I say, Dolittle, what is your plan? The plan? I suppose we do need one. The Queen's only hope is the cure that's never been tested from tree that's never been seen on island that's never been found. Sounds ridiculous. Say it out loud. But regardless of that... We have no choice but to embark on this spareless journey to attain the fruit of the Eden Tree. What? Eden Tree? Oh my, fantastic! The Dolittles with their Eden Tree island. - Isn't it enough that your wife-- - Shut up, Blair! Sorry, I meant to say, glad to see you again, Blair. We are off now, tell her. Its fruit, is that to cure every malady known to men, grant eternal life, even restore the hair on your head. You must let nothing pass her lips that hasn't been made and served by you. - Clear? - Yes, I'll see to it. Now it's us to the carriage. Jip, you need to stay behind and guard the queen. Very important. Right. Guard-dog mode. Stand up everyone while I secure the perimeter. Excuse me. I do so admire how you don't give up. The Queen is counting on both of you. Good luck. Right. Chop chop. There is a long voyage in front of us. And the boat isn't gonna sail itself. Deep breath, Yoshi. Haven't got all day. Seems like she's filled up. Maybe, we could squeeze in one more. Oh, no. One more stop, good fellow. I can't hear you because I am not here. I believe it's time to go our separate ways. I am going with you. Certainly not. It's far too treacherous. - I'm your apprentice. - You? No. No. Oh, you have an apprentice. You don't need an apprentice and an ostrich. I'll go home. I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I pretend you belonged. I was helpful there, wasn't I? The animals like me, I don't take up much space. I think I belong here. Don't make me go home. Please. What is that around your neck? Move. I'm worried about the boy, Bethan. Give him time. Time is all. We're hunters, Bethan. Hunters. It goes with certain, we hunt things, he frees things. A rabbit, mice, --- and spiders outside. Nobody likes spiders, not even spiders. --- Poly? What are you doing here? Making sure you don't miss the boat. Am I talking to an animal? Just like Dolittle. Oh, no. I'm speaking human. Better than any parrot ever has, actually. Now, let's pack some clothes. Come on. But Dolittle said I belong here. Little help, Tutu. Well, I've never heard him say anything of the sort. There's something special about you, Stubbins. Something I've only seen in two other humans. You belong with us, kid. And you let me worry about Dolittle, that's my job. So, are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime? - I'm in. - Of course, you are! Poly, let's move, we got a boat to catch --- Fret not, Mon chÃ©ri, we have the perfect plan. New plan! New plan! Don't let them get away! Why are they chasing us? We're not criminals. Speak for yourself, we're wanted in three forests. And it's not an escape mission unless you're being chased. - Which way, Tutu? - Down! Clear the way! This way! Get off the road, Mon chÃ©ri. See you later, suckers. We've done it! We've done it! We... missed it. Okay, boss, what's our next move? We get hair loses, change our identities, ditch the kid in the river. Whoa, whoa. Easy. What about that bridge? Yes! The Bridge! - That was my next suggestion. - Let's go! Come on, Doc. At least get out of the hammock. Your sea sickness will wear off. Try some of this ginger root. You'll get your --- back. You look terrible. --- Who put me in this hammock? I am the captain of this ship ---! Raise that luffing sails, will you? That's a big bite. Everyone, look. Is that the boy? He's coming to finish the job. He won't rest till I'm dead. He's obsessed. John, slow the boat down! No. I wanna go faster. Sorry kid, Johnny says no. --- - I hope they make it. - Me too, Dabs. Moment of truth. Big hole, pull the pluck! Maybe this is a bad idea. Let's go Stubbins! Let's go! --- --- Vive la rÃ©sistance. Is that thing up to code? No! No! Jump, murderer. You got this! I can't look. No, no! Yes! Busted, kid. You made it. Why y'all cheering for the kid who shot me? He's alright. Poly, can I have a word please? --- What was she thinking? The boy nearly killed himself. Oy, this is my ship, right? And I'm its sovereign. - And there are consequences-- - To ignoring me. Is that what you were going to say? Don't twist my words. And stop messing with my routine. Look at the state of you. You're sick as a dog. Actually, I have a medicine. See? This licorice root --- Sit down, John! Don't embarrass me in front of the crew! I'm sparing you embarrassment. You need a trim. Alright, but quick. It's important to maintain my --- This ship is dangerous --- That's a private conversation. - Okay. - Sorry. I know this particular voyage is hard for you, John. It is for me, too. I brought to you Lily just when you needed her. And now you need one of your own kind again. Someone without feathers or fur. Fine, the boy can stay. But it'll be on my terms. And I am to keep him quite busy. You'll do it with a smile on your face. Crew, it seems you got a new shipmate. I just told Poly, we are a bit short on --- - You won't regret it. - Welcome aboard. I hear you can be a big help by clearing this out. Up to where it belonged. Oops, those as well. And that. I got these. Careful with that medical equipment! Because the parrot's in charge of my ship. Brilliant! He's absolutely thrilled to have you. Hello there, little squid. You don't understand me, do you? That'll be preposterous. - MÃ¼dfly. - I wasn't talking to the squid! I'm dispatching a frigate, the Brutenda. To follow Dolittle. You must not support him in his foolishness, My Lord. England has enemies everywhere waiting for the slightest sign of weakness. Entrusting beloved Britain to a child queen? That is lunacy. So, while I remain here ensuring no one prevents me from taking the throne, you will be on the Brutenda making certain Dolittle never returns. Round two, show me ---, Cheech. Come on. One. Two. Jab. Jab. Pass. That's how you defense his attack. I really don't wanna fight you. We are not fighting, are we? This is a very practic session. I think I'm getting this. I'm actually starting to understand. Stop worrying, John. Every step is planned out in my journal. I'll be back before you even miss me. Are you alright? I think I'm beginning to understand a little bit of what the animals say. Seems you are, boyo. What kind of polar bear works on their tan? What kind of a bird... - Wait, are you even a bird? - Of course, I am. - Can you fly? - No. - Can you swim? - No. - What can you do? - I can run. I can run. What bird stuff can you do? What bear stuff can you do? You win this round. Pickles? Oh, you are saying warship. Weird, if you'd asked me for pickles. Who could eat if we're under attack. Enemy! --- Elliot, you and Elsie, ready the machine. We gonna need speed, so do the call. Secure the lifeboats! This whole thing is death boat. Stubbins, boy. I need you now more than ever. Just stand still. I surrender! We surrender! Hello, Blair, you chinless wanderer. He said something about my chin, didn't he? It's a magnificent chin, sir. We're in their sights. Cannons are taking aim. Let's turn this ship! I'm on my way. It is time for me --- I thought of several seeds of crazy time. Once Humphrey's been secured you pull me on Yoshi signal. Me? I can't handle that kind of pressure, Doc. I'm a cheer-quietly-from-the-sidelines kinda gorilla. Don't worry, Cheech. You --- You're stronger than you know. And remember, courage is not the absence of fear. Wait! You got cut off. I can't hear you. - I need the second part! - No time, Cheech, let's go! Oh, look, look! They are already abandoning the ship. Pull! This is gonna be cold. But I'm coming in hot. Humphrey here. Let's shook it up. - Where are we headed? - South. Okay. I can do this. I can do this. - Full spin ahead! - Go Humphrey! Go! Are they pulling away? Do it, whale! Do it! It's working. How is this possible? It appears Dolittle and polar bear have harnessed the whale-- It was a rhetorical question! Just fire! I lost the rope! I failed, I knew I couldn't do it. - Yoshi! - Hang on! I'm coming, kid! You're doing great. It's gonna murder my back. Quit complaining, you oversized flamingo. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! I let you down, Doc. Look at me. I'm fine. We're all fine. - I froze. - No, no, Cheech. It's okay to be scared. You saved me, did you? Fair play. Thanks very much. Well-done everybody. Do you want to keep along now, kid? I guess I do. - I guess I do. - Great work, kid. In our deaths MÃ¼dfly! They've gone away, sir. Oh, really? I thought they disappeared into thin air. I'm afraid not, sir. They've escaped. ---, Lieutenant Tucker, I can see they've escaped. But not for long. It's a miracle, that must mean, I am the chosen one. I'm gonna change the wor-- Whale power. Dolittle had to write a paper about it, which, of course, nobody took seriously. This one even theorises the existence of dragons. Just preposterous. Sir, I'm afraid your obsession with Dolittle-- What obsession?! I'm not obsessed with Dolittle. You are obsessed with Dolittle. You're the one obsessing about my obsession with Dol-- I loathe to admit it, but he's move valuable alive for now. But, luckily, I think I know where he's going. Kevin's log, day seven. I'm now totally isolated. The enemy has ingratiate himself with the captain and crew. No sign of promised tropical island, or its magic fruit. But I will endure. Take the wheel, Stubbins. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I have to coordinate our route coordinates. The bees are buzzing about you. Seems you are getting the rudimentary grasp of their language. Thirty five degrees, --- How I know is just when they fly in a zig-zag pattern. They sort of go... Which means "back off, kid." But when Dab-Dab goes... That means "look at this." - "Look at me." - Oh, close. Not bad at all. When Chee-Chee says... When Chee-Chee says... That means... "Where is my blanket?" Very good. Is that the map to Eden Tree island? The Eden Tree cannot be found on any map. At core it's an island is as suggestive as the whole world. --- That is why we must first go to Monte Verde. Birthplace of the only person to ever chart course to the Tree. Her name was Lily. She wrote the route legend of wrong voyage, she was shipwrecked. The world lost the greatest explorer I've ever known. The journal from that expedition is all that survived. Elliot, Elsie, do you mind? So, anyway, bigger picture. If we to have any chance of saving the Tree we have to go to Monte Verde and steal that freaking journal. Steal the journal? Did I say that? That's the worst that can happen. Don't worry, I know a no man when I see one. And that was not no one. Stealing the journal is not a big deal. In fact, Monte Verde itself is not a big deal. The stop at Monte Verde was a very big deal. After all, this island of bandits and thieves was once a place Dolittle, Lily and I called home. Until the Doctor made an enemy of the island's notorious ruler, King Rassouli. And just our luck, his most prized possession was the very journal we needed to steal. So, Dolittle needed a disguise. While I was left watching over the rest of the crew, Dolittle and Stubbins snuck into the palace. I don't want to die! Once inside, their path ended at a heavily bolted door, naturally. But, Dolittle still had... questionable contacts on the island. The opening bid will suffice. You have my attention. Don Carpenterino, I am here on behalf of these humans, they will pay you handsomely for your family's lock-picking skills. You called on me for this on a day of my daughter's wedding? Wait a minute, which daughter? It's not... Sheila? My Sheila? She's getting married?! With scorpion named Dylan. Sorry, boy scout, I guess Sheila into bad boys now. We were gonna spend the rest of our lifespans together. Hold on, James. What's your human's best offer? Two now, and two later. Okay, you have yourself a deal. See you around, boy scout. Guys. I'm no boy scout. Also, what that scorpion got that I don't got? Besides a massive stinger. Get over it, James, they've dated for two weeks. These bars are new. Totally messing up my plan. I can fit through them. No, no. It's too dangerous. I can't let you go in there on your own. Let me take him there, Doc. I need something to distract me from this Sheila reveal. Are you sure your reds is in the right place, James? Oh, yeah! I'll get the kid in, and then fly head first into a brick. Just kidding, I'm fine. Alright. James will look after you, it's fine. Listen closely, get the journal, you get out of there. Go to his room quietly, look for the tiger's eye. Go down the hidden staircase, and most importantly, keep your disguise on. There's just one little thing you should know. Rassouli loves his cats. But, that's no problem for us, because we can just fly right over... Oh, I see the mistake I made here. You can't fly. Watch out, --- on your six. Oh, God! Sleek move, kid. We make a pretty good team. A real couple of bad boys. Okay, partner, you know where to go. I'll keep watch on these lions, that's what a bad boy dragonfly does. Would Dylan get this close to a lion? Would he get this close? How about this close? Oh, shit! This is bad... This is... very bad. Lily... Dolittle. We got the journal, open up! Just kidding, he blew it. Bye. Stubbins! Don't let him get to... - Former resident here. - Don't move! Don't touch. All I wanted was my daughter to marry wisely, and instead I got the ring leader of a circus. I never understood what Lily saw in you. A common complaint to the world over for fathers of beloved daughters, but in this instance I think we can all agree it is particularly accurate. Come in here. Come in. Perhaps, you didn't mean any of that-- It was her journal. The only thing of hers my men found in the wreckage. It belongs here! All you had to do was never show your face again. And even at that you failed. Now you will pay for taking Lily away from me! You knew what will happen if you returned. Yes. Barry! You should go. It's my past that caught up with me, not yours. Yeah? - You're my friend. - Go. Don't look back. You're better off without him, kid. I'm in compliance. Yes! Finally, some action down here! Boy, I was a good boy. You know, Doc, I hate to tell you, but you're going down, my friend. You do well to keep your --- teeth together. What is that smell? Hey, fellas, I think Doctor Dolittle did a little doo-doo. Did Doctor Dolittle do a little doo-doo? Perhaps, when I'm out of here I'll teach you some manners. And accept your lucky foot as payment. Oh, this lucky foot? Don't worry about it, Doc. 'Cause both of my lucky feet are gonna be tap dancing on your grave when my guys done with you. Taking bets over here. In the right corner, wearing golden stripes with a sparkling record of 872 kills, Barry 'The Butcher' Burnstein. Doctor Dolittle, remember me, your old patient? It's Barry. Barry, how can I forget you? Oh, but you did, Doc. We were just starting to make progress. And then you ran off with Rassouli's daughter. And abandon me. I'm back now. Perhaps we should just pick up where we left-- Enjoy the feast! What will happen to Dolittle? Well, he's a dead man. You think you can talk his way out of it, but Barry has gone completely nuts. But you, you are one of us now. To Dolittle's death! Hey! It's you! You made it. I need you to get the message to my friends in the boat. A message? Sure. When have I ever let you down? All I hear day after day, "Oh, Barry, you're such a disappointment. Why can't you be more like your brother? He eats poachers for a living, you know." Yes, Mother, I know! The whole jungle knows! Oh, my head. Your migraines are brought on by severe maternal issues, and compounded by sibling rivalry. Please, make it stop. Oh, no, no! - Lie down. - Oh, my head. We could resume your treatment. The stress is unbearable. I just want to be a good boy. Just want to make Mommy proud. Yeah? No one I eat will ever be good enough. There's a release, release it. I will never be good enough. Unless I eat you. Every mother wants their son to grow up and eat a doctor. You're sick kitty. Come here, Doc. I'll make it quick. I'll get another one within an hour. Give up, Dolittle. You can't outsmart-- What was that? Wait. That was over there. And now it's over here. There's nothing in there, of course. And now it's over here. Oh, I lost it. Of course, I did-- A cat is still a cat. Easily distracted. New game, Doc. Get back here. Come on, Doc! Okay, James, you can't let this kid down. You gotta deliver this message. Oh, no. It's James. From now on no more focusing on --- Poly? Is that you? Your feathers really filled down here. - What happened, James? - Oh, right! Message. My bad. The kid's been captured by Rassouli, and Barry is about to have Dolittle for lunch. Looks like we are going to show after all. Be a darling, and grab my dynamite, will you? We need to split up if we are going to pull this off. Chee-Chee you are coming with me. Where are we going? No, don't tell me. Just tell me when we get there. Yoshi, create a distraction. Hope this is enough. We are being attacked! Come on down, Doc. --- Oh, no! Worse than I expected. I got you Doc. Back off, Barry! Poly, don't! An appetizer? I got you, Poly. Any final diagnosis, Doc? Don't you want to be the best Barry you could be? I'm about to. I am not a prisoner of fear! - I am not a prisoner of fear. - Oh, no, no. It's okay to be scared! - It's okay to be scared! - You should be scared! It's okay to be scared! Give him a good --- Okay. We're doing this. We are doing this! We're not doing this. Get him in the low area. Down there. That's gotta hurt. --- That will work. Cheap shot, ape. I haven't finished by treatment. Go to sleep, baby tiger. Time to put those claws away. Anyway. You need this more than I do. Tell me that I'm enough, Mommy. I had fifty grand running on that. Well, I won't pay that. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner. Thanks for sticking with me, Doc. - I have it. I have this. - Hold! And now. I'll have it. She had such a sure hand. Exactly what the doctor ordered. What did they offer you MÃ¼dfly, to murder the Queen of England? Quite a few things, actually. Knighthood. Windward house. Chair at the Royal College. In no particular order. Oh, and the icing on the Madeleine will be the scientific accolades that accrue from the proper study of the Eden Tree. All thanks to Lily Dolittle. Actually, no. That's still Madeleine. The icing is knowing that you know I won. Oh, and Dolittle, I'm so sorry for that hole in your boat. What hole? Abandon the ship! Everyone out of boat! Not good. Hold on! - Help! - I'm on it, Doc. I can't fly... and I can't swim. I got you, buddy. Plimpton? I'm not losing you, bro. Step away from the light! There is no light! I'm alive! I'm alive. I'm alive. Thanks to you, Yoshi. You've always been so kind. It's difficult to say goodbye. Please don't say that. It's alright. You've done your best. Your Queen is proud. Where are you Dolittle? Hey, big bird, you're doing okay? No. Nothing about me is okay. My father was right about me. I should've been an omelet. I know how you feel. My dad said he was going for a pack of seals one night, and never came back. I guess we got something in common after all, Plimpton. What is this feeling? I'm all warm and fuzzy inside. That's friendship, bro. Not bad. Bro. I'm not crying, you're crying. Right. Gather around, shall we? Let's flip where we are now. That's the spirit, John. This is gonna be good. I'm already getting duckbumps. - We are finished. - What? Is this a pep talk? 'Cause it's a weird one. I can smell defeat like a truffle pig. This can't be the end. - Yeah. I suppose. - We gonna still save the Queen. - No. - We can still save your house. I believe in you. - We can keep coming. - You got a point there. Except the journal's gone. We have no way to find the Eden Tree. - And our boat has sunk. - He makes a strong argument. On the plus side, you are all cured. Chee-Chee, you are brave now. Plimpton and Yoshi are getting along. - Remember back? Back. - Sort of. And Stubbins, you made friends, and you clearly talk to them. You don't need me. I'll stay here and offer medical services to this island of random bandits now. - Boss. - The doctor's here, seeking new patients. Cash only. Ladies, Gentlemen, who would like to dance? I got a bad case of dancing fever, so, watch out, it's infectious. Can't help him. The explorer you told me about, she would've never given up. She was your wife, wasn't she? You wanna know the ironic bit? I don't know what ironic means. Irony is when you find a woman, and she makes your life more wonderful than it ever had the right to be. And the poof, she's gone, and it's all your fault. This journey was my chance to finish what she started. Lily insisted I care for the animals at home, so I stayed behind. Rassouli's right. I should've been with her. All I have left of her is a ghost I see when I look at our rings. So, you see her, too? Not only did you lose my daughter's journal, but your polar bear blew up my village. We don't know that. And your gorilla beat up my tiger. No good. Let's go. No, no. Irony... is me wanting to kill you with every fiber of my being, but loving my daughter more. I miss her, too. She would wanted you to... to keep going. So! Keep going, before I start feeling sentimental. She's saying we don't have a ship. Well... I have a perfect vessel for you. Better to fix her up, huh? The boat. At least it flows. We'll just have to make the best of it, are we? Help me. Who's that? Hi, I'm Jeff. --- If Lily's research was correct and MÃ¼dfly was well on his way to Eden Tree island, all we needed to do was track MÃ¼dfly. But how would we do that? Whales, boyo. Whales. - I can't believe you've clipped him off. - I know, that man has no chin. We found him. Follow us. Eden Tree island. Extraordinary. This must be it. The map points us directly into the centre of this mountain. Don't look down. Let's keep our beaks up, shall we? Trying to stay positive. But what a heck are we doing up here? Going the back way my feathered buddy. What are you complaining about? This is the widest branch I've ever screwed on. Don't look down. Look at me. Whoa. A big cave. Stay close. Keep quiet. Kevin's log. Day 12. Some force beyond my comprehension still compels me to follow this crew of lunatics, the squirrel killer, and their deranged leader. Perhaps, it's the magic tree that draws me. Hide, we're close. ---, Now stay down. Foxfire rocks. We must be near it now. Look, Doc. It's lighting a path all the way to... the man who wants us dead. Stay right there! Go on then, soldier boy. Explain it yourself. Hello, Blair. - Get over there! - Looking for a Tree, is it? Trees are not growing in caves. Didn't you pay attention to botany class? No! But pay attention to this, Dolittle. I beat you. - Filthy animal. - Let go! Order! So. - Where is it? - Where's what? - The Eden Tree. - Truth is... I haven't got a clue. Don't be ridiculous, you're John Dolittle. You get everything you want. Not today I don't. You really don't have any idea, do you? How does the ignorance feel? Very silly, actually. One must outgo uncertainty, don't you think? That's how Lily lived her life. And place the unknown at, the answers will be revealed. You sad, misguided nut Dolittle! Give that! Give me that! I will find this damn Tree on my own! And by God, history will remember me! Yes. Something interesting is going on now. It rather feels a lot larger than all of us. Look out! Down here, all of you! Come on! --- He saved me. I have a second chance... to live a life of kindness and generosity. Take him, not me. I am a good person now. That window, can be a run for that ditch. Once-- - Yoshi! - Get this off of me. - Cheech. - Help me, Plimpton. I'll save you, bro. Right, John, think fast. Take this off of me! --- No! Dolittle! Help! Is he speaking dragon? You may be able to speak my language, but that does not make you worthy of the fruit. I know protecting the Tree is your duty, but you won't be able to continue much longer considering the damage you've taken, and the pain you're in. You know nothing of my pain. But I do. I lived it as well. The kind that doesn't come from bullets or the blades, but cuts much deeper. But known in every moment, in every movement you feel that pain again. It's hard to carry on. But you've lost the ones you love. Just leave! What just happened? Broken hearts. What the heck are you doing here? Don't worry guys, I got this. We're both dragons. Hey, just wondering, you know, dragon to dragon. If you wouldn't mind telling me what... She's really mad, I'll wait for whoever survives outside. John, let's just get out of here while we still can. No. I think we are here to help her. Yeah. We haven't got much time! I imagine it's a bit tender here. I'm unarmed. I pose no threat to you. Emotional stress over the years has done damage to your stomach. Get away from me! You have severe infectious colon. And if I don't manually fragment it, it will septic. And you won't be able to incept anything at all. - That sounds like some tummy ache. - I'll tell you what. Give us five minutes. If you don't feel better, you can fry us all-- Stop talking! Just get on with it. We have to get you on newer side. We need to perform an emergency extraction. Extraction? What are we pulling out? Go get it, Doc. - We got your back, Doc. - It's showtime. Three, two, one. Turn! Chee-Chee drop me the forceps. - Knew it will come in handy. Told ya! - You realise what to do? - Just breathe. - Works for me. It's okay, just hold on my wind, sweetie. Dab-Dab's here. Oy! You are my apprentice. You keep her calm. Did you know that leek is the national emblem of Wales? Very useful it is, too. You might feel... a bit of pressure. I got her. Oh, --- - No, you don't. - Oh my God! Just clear the way. Is that hardware? --- Give us a deep breath. Hold it. - --- - What's up, Doc? We're removing the blockage. Yoshi, help. Go way beyond the initial whiff of wind. Respect. Nobody heard that? Nothing to be ashamed of. We all do it. We are all animals. I keep tasting it. I'm back. What did I miss? Oh my God! - --- - We're in the hulk-duck now! - Chee-Chee, get behind me. - I'm with you, Doc. On your call. --- Blood rushing to my head. Everything turning red. One last push ---, please. Thank you. - We did it! - Team work makes the dream work. That was the one. We did good. To put simply, remove your grievances, less armor in your diet. I've seen armies of every kind, but nothing like you. What unites such a group of creatures? Well, we may not --- but somehow... - we're just strong together. - Good boy. Now let me help you. Lily would have loved it, John. We would never have found it without her. I just got the chills. I'm not cold. Thank you for showing me the way, my love. --- Raise her up and restore her, to allow her continuance amongst us. O Father of mercies and God of all comfort-- I'm sorry we can't save you, Your Majesty. It is with great sadness-- Wait a minute, I smell something. It smells like... Hope! ...I have to announce... that the Queen is no longer-- Here they come, Doctor. My mates! Very dramatic entrance, boys. Well played. - We've arrived. - Dolittle! Clear path, there's no moment to waste. I have secured that what you said does not exist. Behold, the fruit of the Eden Tree. I said clear the path. Seize them! Sorry. - Go! - Seize them! You were born for this moment. I was. Mini, deep flight. Go! Go! No! No! Kevin's log. Day unknown. The killing is ended. Let there be life. Lady Rose. Is that a giraffe in my bedchamber? Yes! Oh, yes. And a polar bear, and a gorilla, and a parrot and a duck, and ostrich. A humble thanks. Pray to God. And well done, Doctor Dolittle. Not quite done, are we? Interesting, carry on, Sticks. I'm all ears. What's that? Sticks here agreed to stay behind, keep his 12 eyes on things. He's was just catching me up. Like all leaf insects, he speaks an iterable phrases, and he states, Lord Badgley did poison the Queen. What? He did? Really, Dolittle? This is too much. You also heard --- Well, this would be the time. No, that's alright, Sticks. Is quite adamant. In his right pocket the vile. That would be seven. In his right pocket the vile of deathly nightshade. Let's have a look, shall we? You can't possibly believe that he's talking to an insect. Well, I've spoken to ladybugs, making a wish before they fly away. Let's have a look. No one messes with my family! Take one more step and I'll rip you a-- To the Tower with him. - Someone's been a bad boy. - Come on. I don't know why you all standing there. Nobody's died. Leave me in peace. You too. Not you, Doctor Dolittle. A moment, if you would please. Lady Rose, who is this person and why is he staring at me? He's Stubbins. I want to be an animal doctor. He saved your life. Enough, we have far less important places to be. Our story ends the way it began. I have a letter for Doctor Dolittle. Somebody get me down! Mostly. There once was a peculiar doctor. Who found he was at his best when sharing his extraordinary ability with others. Excellent. Soon, Doctor Dolittle re-opened his gates as Lily would have wanted. - Three more in the queue, gang. - Copy that. Dolittle discovered his place in the world once again. After all, it's only by helping others that we can truly help ourselves.
