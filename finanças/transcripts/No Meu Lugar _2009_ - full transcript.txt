Help. Help me, somebody help me, please! -Shit. -What the fuck... Stop the car, stop it, stop the car. Help me, man, for god's sake, help me. Get out of this car, please. Help me, they're inside, please. Please, help me, get out of this car. They're inside. They're fighting, he's got a gun. He's got a gun, man. Take it easy, lady. What 's going on? They're inside, fighting. He's got a gun, but it isn't his. Who's got a gun, ma'am? Deputy, wait. We better wait for back up. Madam, just a second, stay calm. Vehicle number RPOO7 asking for priority... Fuck, don't say a word!! Get out of here. Get out of my house! Please, help him, the gun is not his!! I told you, I just wanna get outta here. Where's my son? Tell me where the fuck is my son! I'm coming in! Deputy, let 's wait for some back up! Hey, easy there! Easy, I'm coming up to talk, ok? Let go of the hostage! Fuck... Stay there, bro. You don't even try it, bro! Stay there, damn it! Calm down, officer. Calm down! Calm down my ass! It 's gonna be alright, man. Put that down, everything is fine. Let 's talk. You let go of him... Don't fucking point this shit to me. Put it down... Bro, get out of here! Out! Out! Officer, wait, officer. Come with me, tell me your story and everything will be ok. -Put that shit down! -I just want to get out of here. Don't you see you're upset, man. -Put your weapon down, officer! -Listen to me, fuck! You either leave right now or blow his head off, bro! Carlos! Carlos, get an ambulance, fuck! Come on in, dear. I have to turn on the main power. Wait up, Fe. Mind the stairs... Except for this dust bomb that went off in here, everything looks the same. Darling, you never told me it was so... Yeah, I know. Amazing, isn't it? It has grown so much these past years, I can't even recognize it anymore. It looks like... it looks like a creature. A living creature, growing, expanding. Let 's go? The children are waiting... Yes. Pimenta, open up that curtain, so we let some light in here... Deputy, we need to go over some facts. Please answer only what you remember perfectly. In which position were the criminal and the victim... the moment you fired your weapon? Right there, where Pimenta is standing now. And... to which part of the hostage's body was the weapon pointed at? To his head, I think. But there was too much light. And where were you pointing your weapon to? To the bastard! He was really upset, yelling a lot... I've told this thing so many times already... but ok. Then I told him not to do that... But could you see clearly? What was your exact position the moment you shot? Deputy, could you be any more specific? There's a guy out there. A man with a camera. If someone shoots one of those guys... Fuck... Have you got a cigarette? We have to keep going, deputy. There are some key doubts... Fuck! You still have doubts? After all I've said? Let 's keep it calm, deputy. Calm... calm... I am already calm. You keep asking me that, and that 's what I'm doing. I am calm. We're going over this for the tenth time... and I am calm. It 's just that you already know everything. They already know everything. Everyone has already seen it all on TV. This is our work, deputy, you know that. You were the ones who put this shit on TV, wasn't it? We know you did the right thing, deputy. We just want to know how and why things got out... Got out of hand! I know, Pimenta. Has anyone got a light? Deputy, can we continue? I'm coming! Where should I put it down? Right here, over the counter. I'm going in for a sec, but I'll be right, ok? Ok. I'm done here! Hello! Got to get outta here. Get back to work... Hey, won't you give me a lift down? -A lift, huh? -Yeah. Get on! I'm late to get the kid from school... Turn it around, then I'll sit. Thanks. Long time no see. Just saw me now. I'm seeing, still. Cut it out. The kids are coming out and I'm still at work... Ok, sorry... Hey, man, what 's your name again? Roberto. Bye, Roberto. Come on, dad, sweep that corner! I'll get to the corner, you bet. Lili, darling, would you give us a hand? Come on, mom, I'm tired. Travelling is so tiring... She's tired from the trip. Great... She was the one driving, that 's why. Daddy, under the chair, underneath the table. I'll get to it, don't worry. Impossible. All I'm wearing are violet or green dresses. I hate these colors. I could swear these were your favourites five years ago, dear. And, look, no pants. Why didn't I use to wear pants? What? You've grown up. Sweetie, we're planning on staying here til Monday, all right? Ok, fine. There's too much to get done. A lot to pack up. You've seen how this place is a mess, haven't you? But we are still going back to Curitiba, right? Of course we are, my darling. Of course we are... You need help, honey? No, thanks. Everything's fine. Have you checked the light thing I asked you? Yeah... A bus hit a lamp-post down the street. A lady died, but they said it wasn't anyone we know. You sure you don't need anything? You may set up the table for us, then. How was it, today? Nothing new, honey. Just a lot more of the same. I think I've got a cold coming. Tomorrow I'll try to cheer up a bit. Walking is good for the legs. That 's good. And giving up smoking can help too. I'm already a little rusty. Daddy! I've just remembered... You'll miss the final episode of the soap opera!! Fuck. Look at her!! All dressed up, where are you going like this? Did you forget, bro? -" Bro" ... Forget what? -The party. You were invited to the party!? 'Cause I was. -I was. -Paulo Roberto?! What is it, old lady? You left such a mess up in the bathroom. You get up there right now, and tidy it up before we leave. Come on, mom, I've just taken a shower... I'm all dressed up, got my best perfume on! I'll clean it when I get back. I know the drill, Roberto. You'll get back all lazy. and it will all come down to me, as always!! Wait a second, let the lady go by. Go on, darling, you can pass. -Thanks... -You're welcome. -How 'you hanging on, sweetie? -Fine. Let your brother carry it for a bit, cause we're getting to the stairs now. Let him hold it for you, it 's heavy. Go. Be careful. Great! Good job, miss big-ass... Mom! I told you not to call me Miss Biguiss... No, I didn't call you Miss Biguiss. I called you miss big-ass... I'm going to smack you!! -Stop it, Beto. -No, don't hit me, Anna. I'll punch you nice and hard. Wow, she comes right up with a brutal shot. She's getting mad at you, Beto. You'll give Beto a big punch, then? You'll give me a lung-destroying punch? Yeah. Alberta, I was just talking about you. How handsome is this son of yours, huh? Hi Aninha, is this gift for Maria Luisa? Take it up inside, she's right there. Everything fine? Everything fine, my son. Take a look at the nice little pastries I brought for the party! Hmmm... I love these pastries of yours. What about Maria Luisa, she craves for them. -Maria! Happy birthday! -Thank you. You getting a bit older today. -What a beautiful table, dear! -Did you like it? I've put this paper decoration there. It 's pretty, isn't it? It goes well with the balloons... Where have you gone to, dear? Nowhere, mom. I'm right here. Your uncle stopped by earlier... Did he? And how is he doing? The usual... This party is boring me numb, mom. Children and oldies, that 's all there is! Can't take it anymore. I'm going out with Gilson. Chat a little, have a beer. Okay. Aninha won't stop asking me to stay overnight. I think I will, Beto. I am afraid of walking out alone with her, anyway. You're right. Take care, mom. Is everything ok? Come on, kids, dinner is ready. Let 's eat? Come on, Lili! Hi, there... Hello! Thank you, very much. -Wow. Cheers! -Cheers. -Looks like this night will be special. -You think? Hey, watch out!! Get a room, you guys! Forget it. Let 's get out of here? Where are you taking me to? You just wait... don't trust me? Sure I do... I like you a lot, y'know? That 's good, since we've been kissing here for so long. What? Nothing... Look, better not fall in love, 'cause I'm a dangerous girl! -Are you? -Yes. Bye, Beto. Hey, hey! You leaving like this? Don't even stop for a second to talk to your brother? May God be with you, ok. Hey, miss big-ass, your bro loves 'ya, ok? Whassup. There you are. Thanks, dad. Have a good day in school, honey. It 's a beauty, huh, deputy? Nah, this one is too heavy for me, man. You just say what you want, and we can get it for you. No need. I've got mine right here. That 's gonna be it? I'm drinking all by myself, is that it? Go on, Carlinhos, today the beer is on you. You are kicking ass today, Z?! And they keep messing with me! They even took me away from the beat. If I could just take that shot again, I would have a nice medal hanging here. Fall guy, Z?. That 's what you are... Hi, is Beto there? I haven't seen him. Thank you. Hey, there, looking for something? No. I was heading home, when I thought about buying some fruits. Oh, I see. You want me to show you where the fruits are? Are we staying here, Beto? There's people around here, man. There's no one there. Just the two of us. You're crazy? We can't do it here, we can't . Let 's go up there? You want to? I do. Go up then. Just keep going. Hello. Hi, Ms. F?tima, how are you doing? Of course... No, of course I want to meet you. It 's just that I need some time to finish... Ms. F?tima, I need... Take it easy. You won't let me speak. Hello. Wait a moment, Ms. F?tima, would you let me speak? Have I ever hidden anything from you? Ms. F?tima, I've never hidden anything from you. How... how's that? In these past four years, we came to visit you many times. You were the one who never came up to our place. Ms. F?tima, we both know that Henrique wouldn't sell this house... for the most obvious reasons. We both have to be reasonable. What? Ms. F?tima, if it was up to me... you really wanna know? If it was up to me, I'd never come back here anymore. Ms. F?tima, for God's sake, stop yelling! You won't stop yelling. If you don't stop, I'm hanging up! It 's impossible to talk to you like this, Ms. F?tima! For the last time, I'm gonna hang up... The guys won't even believe it when we get there, Z?! That sweet piece of ass is always asking about you. You're a real fag for not doing her. POLICEMAN WHO KILLED HOSTAGE STILL SUSPENDED Let 's see if the monk gets out of his cave tonight... or gets in the cave! Fuck, Jaime, do you have a license for this, man? No. Why? Are you planning on arresting me, mr. officer, sir? It 's so weird... It 's so weird being in this house with you. I could never have imagined it back then. Really couldn't . I couldn't imagine we would end up together. Everything was so perfect here... Oh, my God! Sometimes it seems I lead a double life. Then I wonder if selling this house... Is it in any way betraying Henrique? Oh, that 's so silly... No... Yeah, it 's silly. I know I'm being silly. I know it. No, it 's not silly. But it 's also hard for me to hear it. Sorry, sorry, F?, so sorry, forgive me. Thank you. Thank you. I'm here with you... Do you forgive me? Fuck. Is everything ok, dad? Dad? Yeeeah. Everything ok, dad? Jana, I'm cold. We have no electricity. The shower gets cold. I'll bring you your shorts, okay? Yeah... ok. -Is the electricity back? -It is. I'm frying some eggs. You want some coffee? -I do. -Now or later? Later. I'd better focus on the eggs right now. Where did you go last night to come back like that? I went to see some friends. Isn't that what you asked me to do? So the kids would stop saying your father has gone nuts. I never said that. I went to see Jaime, honey, down there at the restaurant. Earlier, I went by the pool house. But Jo?o wasn't there. I think he's going bankrupt, y'know? Can you believe Jaime's wife sent him away? Poor man, lost his daughter... and now he is living on a tiny room down at the restaurant. He doesn't even have a proper bathroom. Poor thing. He's drinking up his soul. I don't think I like Jaime very much, dad. He's all right. What about that egg, coming up any time soon? Almost. Oh, and we've gotta get you some beans... Hmm, I completely forgot... Gui, my dear, take it easy, stop it a second. Put this watermelon down on the table. You'll drop it and make a mess. Just put it aside, ok? Go play with your sister. We're almost done. Go on, my son, go. What about the watermelon, man?! I'm back! No use, you haven't got the watermelon with you! You've been in some heavy shit in life, haven't you, Beto? -I was just a young brat then. -But you did it. I could have done worse. Much worse. What are you thinking about, hon? Do you think at all? I've already told'ya. What? The thing is... The thing is I like you a lot. "The thing" ... What kind of a love confession is this? Don't piss me off, Sandra. I'm no good at this talking shit... when I try it, you make fun of me! Oh, my sweet hot guy... What is it? My father. We're fucked up, aren't we? No, we're not. Don't tell me you're scared. My dad will lay down on the couch and put on his church music... He only wakes up when I bring his supper. Stay... Ok, I'll stay. What 's up? What 's wrong? Are you worried about me, aren't you? Don't be... Yeah... I was thinking about those things you told me yesterday. About that story... I... wanna take care of you. Oh, my boyfriend is such a macho man! Boyfriend? Hey, who said I was your boyfriend? -Really? Aren't you? -Did I ask you out? Oh, yeah? So what are you doing here, huh? Stop it. You are the one inciting me... It 's really nice out here, Z?. I had a backyard like this one at my other place. It was a little bit bigger. Jaime, have you seen what they've done... to that nickelodeon down the street? The porno one. They've made a church out of it! That makes me want to laugh so hard! Going to see some porn films, were you, Mr. Jorge? -He was pretty much a member there! -I thought Z? was the jerker. What a nice thing to say in front of one's daughter. Jana?na, sorry! But she's smart... Good shot, Ronaldinho! That 's my boy... I'll bring us some more cold ones. You'd better, Z?, we're all out here. But I'm not bringing only beer. 'Cause it took me some effort, but I bought you your diet soda. -Hey, Jorge. -Say it. -Is this really a good movie, man? -Let me see it. Take it. Denzel Washington! This is a real classic! The guy blows everything up... Hi. -You must be Jana's father. -And you're that bike's father. I rang the bell several times, I was almost leaving. Excuse me. I like my music loud, Julio. -Julio is your name, right? -That 's it. Julio. I usually get it right. You're Jana's boyfriend. She told me. She told you this? Then, I think I am. No, I mean, I am her boyfriend, yes, I am. Good, good thing you like her. A lot. It 's good for you, man. She's over there, in the backyard. Thanks, man. Have I told you to go? You may not know it, but you're the luckiest guy with a tainted hair. and an illegal bike... I know it, I know it. No, you don't . You can go. Just past the bathroom, to your right. This dial-up connection sucks so bad! I am not feeling well. How do you think I am? I thing you must take it easy. Let 's talk. I've got a purpose here I want to fulfil. I know it 's hard for you to understand, but I'd like you to try. Wow!! That 's deep... Yesterday I saw his mother and his girlfriend in court. They walked right by me in the corridor. It seems the girl will be arrested, there was no way out for her. The wife of the other one was there too, but I don't think she saw me. Beautiful lady, you should have seen her. It 's raining. I can see that. Jana... What? Nothing. Dad's just being foolish. -Lili, you've got some color pens? -In the knapsack. What are you doing there? I'm paging Marina. Telling her you won't stop annoying me. What are you drawing? The teacher told me since I would miss class. She asked me to hand in drawings... of every cool thing I see in Rio as my homework. How badly I miss the time when homework was done by drawing... Tomorrow I'll ask daddy to take me to Corcovado's Christ, so I can draw it too. I also wanna see how tall it is. You know Fernando is not your father, boy. So irritable... What was that? Dunno. Hi grandma. Hi, my darlings. Be careful, there may still be pieces of glass on the floor. Mommy has already cleaned it up. But I've just broken a glass. Come, sit here a bit. Don't worry, that 's nothing serious. I cut my finger when the glass fell down. It 's just a small cut, though. How about you two? How are you? Are you doing ok? -Yeah. -Really? Children, go play in your room now, please. Be careful, it hurts. I'll be careful. I think the two of us can settle this now... can't we Ms. F?tima? This house is Elisa's house, Ms. F?tima. This house is your grandchildren's . Elisa's children's , Henrique's children's . You've got your own house, Ms. F?tima. This house is now... Elisa's . It 's not yours anymore. Thank you. Did you get to know my son, Fernando? No, all I know about Henrique is from what Elisa told me. -Hi Beto! -Uncle... You scared me! What you doing there in the dark? You get scared over nothing, my boy. Night fell, I didn't even notice. How are you? Your blessing, uncle. I missed you, it 's been a long time. I was just enjoying the candlelight, musing a bit. I didn't even notice nightfall. What about my mother, you know where she is? Oh, your mother... she went out to make a delivery to Ms. Em?lia. I don't know what it was, but she went out. I came by just to take a shower and change. I'm going out with some friends from the neighbourhood, and just decided to pass by. Right. Your mother told me you're going out with someone. Yeah, I've got a girlfriend... And is she pretty, the girl? Of course, uncle! I'm no dumb-ass. You're right... That made me think back on my first girlfriend. So many memories, huh, uncle? What was she called anyway?... Time flies, doesn't it? Everything becomes history. I don't know the use of even thinking about it... And, what is the girl's name? Sandra. Sandra. And are you thinking of getting married? I don't know, uncle. There's so much stuff to think about. There's my mother and all... Marriage is a good thing. Mine wasn't , but marriage is a good thing. Don't you want a smoke, son? I'll take one from you. You still drinking, uncle? To quit, to really quit... I haven't . But now can I tell you: you're right, your mother is right, the doctor is also right. But to really quit, I must go to a clinic, for a general detox. And that would be too expensive, I can't do it now. But I am reducing it little by little, so as to avoid a blackout. 'Cause it 's the blackout that really fools a drinker. The guy passes out and believes he just fell asleep. Sleeping feeds us, and we wake up anew. A blackout does not, got it? But, drink or no drink, life ain't been easy for no one, right? Say, you wanna die? No. Me neither. After all, I wanna be around when you get yourself a son. -God willing... -You know what I mean? So that 's how I'm doing it... Slowly, very slowly... 'Cause I wanna see your baby son grow up, my boy. -God willing, uncle, god willing. -Oh, sure, Beto. Now we should be able to see it. There were some small shining stars, glued to the ceiling. Do you remember it? I don't . I think they've lost their glow. Do you remember your father, Guilherme? Your actual father? Lili, look! This works better on a staircase. Do it again, let 's see if it works. -No, it doesn't . -Let me build a staircase. Oh, almost! Look, dad... Do it again. Hey, wake up. Hey, little boy, wake up! Leave me alone, Lili, I wanna sleep some more... Wake up, wake up! Careful, you almost knocked the fruits down! You are the one who put them there... But couldn't you ask before sitting here? -No. -Why not? Why not? Tell me, why not? Because. You're such a pain, doesn't you mother teach you some good manners? -She does. -Really? It doesn't show. You see that, mom? He's not nice to me. You talk nice to her, you hear? Stay there. You wanna sit here, you sit here. You want some mandarines? -No. -So you're gonna eat them anyway. Look, mom. You see... -You're in a bad mood today, huh? -You go with your mom. -You're always the same, both of you. -He's so annoying... -I'll be up front. -Okay. Can I have a cigarette, Bet?o? So, you smoking now? Have you heard about the guy? I have. All fucked up. And he is such a nice guy. Pretty much a choir boy. This was fucking foul play, Bet?o. You wanna know, man, I'm just about to shoot someone, Bet?o, y'know? Just pull the trigger. There's nothing worse than all this waiting, is there? You know, I used to be afraid of getting shot, man. But today, I don't know, it seems as if I became invincible, y'know. Coming right up! Gotta go, Bet?o. -Catch up with you later, bro. -Right, man. Take care. You bet, Bet?o. Thanks, buddy. Be careful, man. Where were you, dad? Nowhere. Where's the car? Far away, Jana. I didn't realize I was running out of gas. I got out and left the car there. Carlos gave me a lift and dropped me off at the bus station. I had no money on me. I collected some coins, so I could take the bus home. I was heading home, but then I decided to get off here. Guess I like this empty beach. I was just about to call you when you called me. What happened to Jaime? He died. Is everything ok, dad? Yes. You got a weapon on you, dad? What is this fucking gun for, dad? Jana, there is no problem. If the cops catch you and you've got a weapon on you, what are you gonna do? There's no problem? You'll be locked up, dad! Jana, I'm a cop. It doesn't matter. If they catch you with this gun on you, you're not a cop. You go to jail, dad! Trust me, Jana?na. Everything is fine. I talked to Julio today, dad. He believes going out on a trip may be a good thing for us. Get in a plane, get out of here. Away from this place. Sweetheart, since when... would you rather take the words of this kid over your father's ? Now I must do what Julio thinks I should do... for my own daughter? Jana, honey, can't you see that this boy... Jana?na, he just wants... He just wants to sleep with you! Fuck you, man! Go fuck yourself, you stupid, stupid man. Cut it out, kid! Put that shit down! This is no game, girlie! Just leave it here, let go of this gun. Show some respect for your father. Stop! Stop! Stop it. Stop it, dear. Stop it. Everything will be fine, honey. Stop it. I just think we could really use some sunlight!! You dumb man. I think she's so annoying. I don't know, my niece really likes her. I thought every girl your age would like her too. Gui must like it. Dunno, that 's children's stuff. It will never come back, no way. He didn't teach me a lot, y'know? He didn't play very well... Only some easy songs. He used to mix them all up. Well, there are some other ones here, look. Cry me a River, Cole Porter, Manh? de Carnaval. Ant?nio Maria... Good stuff. He had good taste in music. Hello. Hello. Did you use to come to this house when I was little? I need to talk... I need to talk to Mauro. It 's Fernando, from his office, yes. I had never been to this house until the day before yesterday. Get away, Guilherme! Sometimes I think I remember you in this house. But there is some stuff I dream and then believe it really happened. Like what? Mauro. Hi, it 's Fernando. Yeah, fine. Look, I need to stay one more day. I know, I know. The project is beautiful, trust me, everything will work out just fine. I need you to send me your comments again, 'cause I lost them among a bunch of emails, can't find it anymore. It just won't come back to me! Ok, ok. It 's important to Elisa. It 's very important to us all. Right. Ok, ok. Thanks, I'll keep in touch. Bye. How did it go? Can't sleep, mother? Woke up thirsty. What about you, son, aren't you going to sleep? In a moment. You've got work tomorrow, right? You've been so down lately, kid... You go get some sleep, please. What 's that look you've got on you? I don't know, mom. Lacking some money, feeling like not waking up to go to work tomorrow. Moving to another town, maybe. But I'm okay, I'm fine. Silly boy. I said I'm okay. You never tell me anything. How am I supposed to help you? You didn't come to annoy me this late at night, did you? Right? That 's all. -Right, right. -Ok, thanks. You apologize to me later. Right, mom. It doesn't have to be right now, ok? You don't shoot now,honey. Wait til it's ready. -But this is the coolest! -Oh,I dropped the candy. Lili? Hi! What are you doing? It's a smiley sun... and several clouds. Say:"bye,dad". Yeah. Bye,dad's going out to buy some drinks. Bye! You go. I'll do just like you do. My two ballet dancers. Give daddy a kiss... A big kiss,a big kiss. -Happy Birthday. -Happy Birthday to you too. Look,someone's ringing the bell, you go answerthe door. -Ok,I'm coming. -I'll get the candies. Beto. hey, Bet?o. Wake up, man. You go make these deliveries. Hurry up, the clients are waiting. The clients are waiting. Hey, Jana! Jana?! Come on, honey. Dad was only joking. Everything will be ok. Trust me. Sometimes, things... It 's just that I want you to be okay. All right? I'm responsible, Jana. I'm still your father. There is some stuff I must say. Sorry, right? Everything will be ok! I'll go back inside now. I thought you would never show up again. I even got goose bumps all over. I would like to have a serious talk with you. I think that 's why I disappeared for a few days. To think, y'know? You wanna go up to my room? Your room? I accept it. That idea you had. I think it can't possibly go wrong. It just can't . Hey there, big boy. You doing better? Do you know that this exists in real life? Look, you know what to do here. I've already seen two of them there. What should I do? I throw the bomb. Then I wait. See, I blew them up. Now we go down slowly. You have to be on the alert, you got it? Looking around... Beto, turn it off. The boy needs some rest. Take it easy. I'm teaching him. -I'll shoot. -You'll shoot? Here, you sit here, it 's better. 'Cause TV can make you blind later in life. You want some candy? I do. Come on, bite, shoot. You eat and you shoot. Be smart. Right. Come back, easy. Shoot. Great. But you're at the first level, that 's why. Now you use the knife, 'cause you're too close, got it? I am shooting. Shoot! Change the weapon. What if your dad gets in here, Jana? He went out to play poker with his friends, and when he does that, he only comes back the following night. What the hell are you doing here, deputy? Hello, Sandra, are you there? Open the door for me, then. Hello. It 's me. We're leaving soon. The truck has just left with the things. If you can call us tomorrow, that will be great. Oh, I was about to forget. The children say hi. Right. For you too... Of course, Ms. F?tima, of course. I promise. I'll bring back the children to visit you. The same to you. Hey, Beto. Let 's go? Let 's go. Dad, may I sound the horn? Sure, wake everybody up. Hey, mom! Tell him to stop with this horn!! -Who's there? -I don't know. Fuck, Sandra, how come you don't know. You told me no one would come here. Sometimes Mr. Henrique forgets his keys... Mr. Henrique? Are you crazy? You should never trust a woman. Let 's go to my room, say we were making out. Making out? And humiliate me to this son of a bitch?! Then take this box and go out through the window. Fuck, I'm taking this whisky and this DVD? Where's the jewellery? Come on, stop choosing. For God's sake, Beto, hurry up! Get out of here... Oh, mama... Beto, he got in. Come here. Listen, there's no way out now. If we take too long, he'll call the police. I know what I'm doing, ok? Take it easy, let him come in. I'm coming, Mr. Henrique. Sandra, is that you? Will you open the door, please? Sorry, I was inside... Will you open the door, please? Are you crazy? Are you deaf?
