Mister! Mister! Here's your bread. I'll get your cupcakes. Biring, is this all for twenty pesos? Nothing I can do about it. - All costs went up. - Here's your cupcake. Is that yours? Someone left it in the bus. The Chinese call this "Bagua". It keeps away bad luck. We have one right there. That's why I think we're lucky. But this one's an antique. With an unusual mirror. It deflects bad spirits so they can't harm us. But this one, you shouldn't hang indoors. - Instead... - Outdoors. I know. I have a book on "Feng Shui" at home. That's supposed to give you more luck, because you didn't buy it. I hope so. I really need it. - What's that? - There's an accident! Thank you, Nestor. - At 9:00 am tomorrow, as usual? - Yes, Ma'am. - Good night. - Good night. These kids are impossible! Daddy...! Daddy...! - Daddy...! - What's going on? - There's a gecko, Daddy! - It's a slink, not a gecko. It's harmless. Where did you get that? I got it from Billy for a pet. It might bite. Slinks are harmless. It eats only grasshoppers. I'm scared of grasshoppers! Who's that kid? He's our neighbor's son. Your son's playmate. Is dinner ready? We're hungry. It's okay, baby. Why are there so many strange animals here? They don't have them at grandma's! Get used to it, Ingrid. We live here now. Come on. Help me cook. Denton, take that outside! Right now! - Not in my laundry! - Yes, Mom! - Nestor! - This fell from your things. Good thing it didn't break. You know, I look handsome in that mirror. You can have this corned beef. - It's my youngest's favorite! Thank you. - I wish you brought a dragon instead! - Tomorrow, Nestor. - Thank you. This tastes delicious! You're a good cook. Yours is different. It's full and tasty. Where's your mother? In Korea... She's a factory worker there for three years now. My father's a cop but they're separated. Who do you live with at home? Aunt Ellen, my mother's sister and Uncle Teodoro. They're usually out. What does your aunt do? They just started a new business. What business? They sell pirated video CD's. Good morning! Be careful, Billy! Joy, we're leaving now. You? You know my schedule. Nestor will pick me up. - Dad, I'll sit in front! - Use the seat belt. Yes, Dad! Mâ€œ "w? Coming, Nestor! - Good morning, Nestor! - Good morning, Ma'am! Let's go to the bank first, then to the bus stop, okay? Yes, Ma'am! I almost won the lottery last night. Just missed it by one number! Don't you find it hard to adjust? Your place is far! The new house takes getting used to... but I can really see lnton is determined now. I feel that we're really a family. You know what's also great? In that house, there's just us. Nobody meddles. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. Alice, the teachers from San Juan are here. Yes, Sir. We're going. - Let's go. - Okay, you go and talk to... Since you are full of positive energy today... you'll enjoy recruiting possible members. Since I am migrating to Canada... I'm leaving them to you, instead of giving them to others. Alice, there are so many of them! I might fail! You can do it. Okay? All right. I'll cover you if you buckle. I'll be there for you. Let's go. - Alice... - Come on! You can do it! Let's go. Let's go inside. Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! Do you want to earn fast? Then let's give a hand to my friend... Joy Ramirez! How's everybody doing? Can I request for a smile? Do you know why we should all smile? Because all of us will soon be wealthy! Demon? Okay, everybody! You listen up, everybody. Today is a very special day for us... because for the first time in the history of our company... someone has reached maximum sales in one sitting! This is truly phenomenal! So, I'd like to acknowledge the person responsible for this... Mrs. Joy Ramirez! Let's give her a big hand! Come on, everybody. Congratulations! Joy, congratulations. Include this on the bill, okay? Alice, I'll just take this pink one. I'll return these three. I'm sorry. - Good evening, Ma'am! - How are you, Beth? I'm fine, Ma'am. Mommy's here! - Hi, Mommy! Good evening, Mommy! - Hi, Mommy! Good evening, Mommy! Where's your Daddy? He called and said he's still out with a client. How's life in your new house? Good evening. Let's go home while it's early. Go get your things! Are you better off now? Can't we stay here longer, Mommy? I wish your life finally improves in that house. We have our own house. That's why we're going home. Mommy, there are so many insects there! Ingrid, don't be difficult. Joy, they can sleep here while waiting for lnton. Please tell lnton I picked up the kids. Get your things now, because a taxi's waiting! We're taking a taxi? So you are better off! Brown-out? It can't be. There's light on the post. Stay here, you two. Mommy will get the flashlight. We should've slept at Grandma's. Ingrid... Mommy! You' re weird! Guard, what are you doing there? Just checking, Ma'am. The lights were on a while ago. Seems there were people inside. But when I approached, the lights went out. How can that be? - We just got home. - Who's that? Can I borrow a spare fuse? Okay, I'll check. Mommy, my pet! What happened to it? I'm sorry, son. - Sorry about your pet. - It's okay. Mommy, something broke! Pity. This was a gift from Aunt Thelma. She said it attracts good luck. I hope we don't get unlucky. Daddy! Daddy, my slink died. - Then my basketball got lost. - Daddy, there was a brown-out earlier. There are more crickets now. Inton, these two did nothing but complain the whole time. Let's talk about that later. Listen, your Daddy got promoted. I closed my 1.5 million contract with ten percent commission. We get 150,000! Congratulate your Daddy! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! You think you're the only one? I did well too. I exceeded my quota today. Guess how much commission I got? How much? 250,000! Won't you congratulate your Mommy? - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Happy Valentine! - Congratulations. We're so lucky! So I proved your mother wrong. About what? That I'm a burden in your life. Don't be silly. - Daddy, look for my ball! - Come, Ingrid. Denton, your Daddy hasn't eaten yet. Hey, we're eating! Dad, did you find it? I can't see a thing. It can't just disappear. Maybe it rolled to the far end. I'll look for it when I have time. Not now. This is my list of prime clients. I'm giving this to you here, instead of at the office. I don't want them to get envious. Really? Thanks. So this means you really won't be coming back? I thought you'll just try it out in Canada. Dado doesn't want us to be separated again. Isn't that sweet? If ever, we'll be back only for vacations. Maybe in Laguna. Why is the Bagua on the door? It will move and swing here. Do you have a hammer? The Bagua is like an altar. It should be fixed on the sturdiest part of the house. Maybe that's why you've been getting all this luck. Alice, it's weird... I wasn't the only one who closed a big deal yesterday. Inton too. Luck's like that when it comes. When it rains, it pours, so to speak. I'm afraid there might be some kind of price for all this. You should be thankful because it's good luck you get. Maybe you have a dwarf here? Or a good spirit? I do feel a presence. That might be your luck. Don't scare it away and don't upset it. How can we do that to something we can't see? Our friends said... no loud music, no shouting and no quarreling. Sometimes, offer it food and drinks. Talk to it once in a while. You know, you're starting to scare me. I don't want something bad to happen to us here. Don't worry. It's a tried and tested formula. We have a special promo. Good afternoon, Ma'am. Pick one. You could be the next grand prize winner. What's the grand prize? 10 thousand pesos worth of gift cheques! Plus a chance to win the grand prize of a home entertainment showcase. - Ma'am, what did you get? - Star. Wow, congratulations! You're the lucky shopper! You're very lucky, you won! Is that true? Uncle Teodoro said it's true that there are spirits. It's also the belief of the church. When we say something over and over, the effect is like a prayer. I offer you. Please bless lnton with luck in his plans. - Spirit, spirit, can we be your friend? - Spirit, spirit, can we be your friend? - If it's okay, show yourself to us. - If it's okay, show yourself to us. - If not, just give us a sign. - If not, just give us a sign. - But don't scare us. Amen. - But don't scare us. Amen. - Spirit, spirit, can we be your friend? - Spirit, spirit, can we be your friend? - If it's okay, show yourself to us. - If it's okay, show yourself to us. - If not, just give us a sign. - If not, just give us a sign. - But don't... - But don't... This bird flu is terrible. We just got over SARS, and there's still no cure for AIDS... yet here's another. - Yeah, right. - Girls, it's a curse! - Because people are getting worse! - People have different priorities now. This is awful too! Another death in the "cursed street"! Joy, this is near your place! Right. That must be the accident I saw the other night. - May I see? - Here, take a look. "Ran over! Body squashed!" He died young, 41 years old. - 41? - Yes. That means born in 1963, Year of the Rabbit. What a coincidence... He was ran over by a Rabbit Bus Liner. - 0h my God! - May I see? My God! It's terrible. There's no such thing as a cursed street... only reckless drivers... Mister! Mister! What happened here? Joy, Grandma Biring is dead. What? She died this morning. How did that happen? It can'! have been just her fever! What did the doctor said? - Leptospirosis. - What's that? They say you gel it from rats. I saw it on TV. When rat urine touches your skin, especially on wounds... - it causes leptospirosis - 1936... Year of the... Rat. Joy! Good of you to visit Grandma. Her daughter arrived from Cebu. There she is. - Bring these over for the visitors. - Excuse me. Mommy, Denton left. He took his bike. He went to Billy's place. When? When you took a bath. He sneaked out. Good evening. I'm picking up Denton. Good evening, too. So you're the mother of Demon? Come in. You' re still young. Thanks. I'm sorry if Billy disturbs you. No. It's okay. The kids had fun watching the video CD's. Don't worry they're religious movies. Mommy, Billy passed by our house yesterday. He saw someone in the window. Then it was gone. Denton, I'm really tired. We don't have a maid. Next time you leave without permission... you're going to get it! Mommy, a man passes by our window every night. What does he do? Does he scare you? No. When he passes... the crickets keep quiet, then I fall asleep. Our house is okay, right, kids? It's lucky. Both your Dad and I were promoted at work. Don't believe everything Billy says. He just makes them up. Where have you been? I fetched Denton from Billy's house. I have an emergency call tomorrow. Out of town, in La Union. Can you pack for me? Why so urgent? What about the kids? They can stay with mother. It's near the school. Let me take that. Why do we have this? I just got it. Inton, why in La Union? The people I'm dealing with are strange. But it's a big contract. I have to impress my boss. How many days? Just the weekend. Kids, bring lots of clothes. You'll sleep at your grandma's tomorrow, okay? We're going to Grandma's! I like it there. How many clothes should I bring, Dad? Where' s Nestor? He's not back yet. He left word to pick you up. Mrs. Francisco's success in Batangas can be your success in Quezon. She was already retired when she started. But she's earning more now than when she was a teacher. All because she joined Triple M Networking. Quezon is a very big province... with many professionals, government employees... who are sure to be interested. Cora, you have many friends in the military. - You too, Wesy, in the beauty parlors. - But how can we avail of the discounts? - My clients are far from the town centers. - Don't worry... because we provide services even if it's far from the Central District. If you want, just take a look at this. Kindly pass it over. So those are our establishments... and here are the places we have which are far from the Central District. Excuse me. - Denise, please take over. - Okay. So, if I were you, I'll buy now. Come and join us. Hello, Joy. Joy Where are the kids? They're already at mother's house. I have to go. I'm here at the express highway. I'm driving. I'll text you when we get there. Bye. A miracle! You dropped by... Thelma. Has he done it again? What is lnton's sign again? Dog. Same as Dina. Yours is tiger. I've been so lucky these past few days. Could this be the payment for all of it? Actually, it's part of your luck. Because you found them out this early. You're lucky because you have the upper hand. Look at this card. This means confrontation. Inverted. That means don't gamble. This one. "Let the rain pour." And only when the cards favor you... should you make your move. Joy, I know it's emotionally difficult... but when you face lnton, don't tell him you know. Because right now, that's your only ace. I'm here in La Union. I'm off to bed. I'M SO TIRED. Hello, Mother? How's Denton and Ingrid? So they're asleep already. Did lnton call? Is that all he said? Thank you. Who's there? Is Denton there? At his grandma's. Billy, it's late. I'm alone at home. Let me ask you something. But you have to tell the truth. Do you kids play with the mirror outside? No, Ma'am. Billy, it's important you tell the truth. I'm always honest with you. When, it's just the two of them, I don't know. But when we're together, we never play there. Because I get scared. Why do you get scared? Because the guards say they see things there. Sometimes even when nobody's here they see the lights are all on. Like there's a party. You shouldn't believe the guards. They just make that up. Of course, they don't want you loitering outside. Or they do it to scare possible robbers. Not only the guards say it. But also the neighbors. Didn't you wonder? Two people died in less than a week. Biring and Nestor. Nestor who? The tricycle driver. Billy, we agreed, right? I don't like that kind of stories! Especially when you tell them to Denton. Guard, it's Mrs. Ramirez. Emergency! Come quick! See anything there, man? Nothing. Ma'am, we didn't see anything. Did you recognize the person? Looked like Nestor, but I'm not sure. Nestor's dead. Billy told me. He got into a fight at the cockpit. Got stabbed. He lost the bet. He was so young. Only 35. His wife just gave birth. Ma'am, please don't be offended if I ask you... Has your house been blessed? Are you saying demons live in my house? I didn't mean it that way. Good! - Take Billy home. - Yes, Ma'am. - Thanks. - Okay, Ma'am. Billy, take care. Let's get my bike first! - Hello? - Good evening. Mrs. Ramirez, please. Speaking. Ma'am, we' re sorry for calling late. Nobody was answering this afternoon. We'd like to inform you that you won the grand prize. A home entertainment showcase from the supermarket promo. We'll deliver it to you. If you could please confirm the address... Block 4 Lot 16 Tulip Street... Phase 4 Alexandrea Executive Village, Cainia, Rizal. - Is that correct? - Yes. Thank you and congratulations. Please, I beg you. Don't bother us. Hello! Alice! Joy! Joy! - Joy! - Joy! At the back! Joy! Open the door! Joy! Joy! - We're here. - Help me! Say it again. Biring was born 1936. Year of the Rat. She died of Leptospirosis. A sickness caused by rats. Nestor, 35 years old. Year of the Rooster. The guards said earlier... he was stabbed. At the cockpit. You saw them? Yes, both of them. They were here. You mentioned another one. The third one? I have a hunch who he is. He's the one who left the Bagua in the bus. I read in yesterday's tabloid. That his accident happened nearby. I saw his picture. His name is Evan Mendoza. 40 years old. Ran over by a Rabbit Bus Liner. Year of the Rabbit. He may be the key to these events. But why is he here? To this address. Are you here about my husband? Are you also one of the... No. I don't know your husband. I just sat beside him in a bus. He left something there before the accident. The Bagua. Did you bring it with you? No. I will tell you something... not just because I want to get back what is mine. I was a real estate agent then. I found the Bagua in an old house I couldn't sell. I took it home because it's supposed to bring luck. Indeed, I became lucky. But people were dying one by one. Like you, I wanted to know why. Soon, everything became clear. Whoever sees himself in the mirror dies. My mistake was telling my husband. Meaning Biring and Nestor... - What if... - You have nothing to worry about. You own the Bagua. You don't have the curse. You have the blessing of luck. Did you try ending the curse? How strange? That's exactly what my husband said. I want the curse to end. The luck will also end. They're connected. I don't want this kind of life! Then give me back the mirror! Even if I do, the curse still won't end. Two people you know already died. How many more? Your neighbor? Friend? Husband? Children? Can you risk your loved ones' lives? Thank you for your time. Bring me back the mirror! I'll pay you! - My God! - Mommy! - Mommy! - We've been waiting for you! He's Atty. Ocampo. Good evening, Ma'am. The lawyer of Mrs. Francisco, your Networking client in Batangas? Well, she died last week. What? What happened to Boots? She died of stroke. Joy, she left you an inheritance. You must've been her favorite. 5 hectares of land in Batangas! With a private beach resort! She left a will. And I would like to read this to you in part. For Joy Ramirez... who was a big part of my life... who served as bridge... and opened the road so that I may reach my dreams... and give a good life to my family. I leave 5 hectares of land to her... Joy, you've been quiet. Aren't you happy with the inheritance? You didn't even ask about my trip or howl am. What's wrong with you? What happened during your trip? I didn't know it was that far. The trip was tiring. But it' s okay. The mission was a success. My boss was happy with my work. He might make me Regional Manager of Cebu. If our luck continues... we'll have not only a rest house in Batangas. We'll also buy a house in Alabang. We won't sell this house. Because this is the source of all our luck. Why look at me like that? Aren't you happy with my good fortune? And with yours? Aren't you happy? You're so fortunate, lnton. You get everything you want. Don't be so naive, Joy. A man can't get everything he wants. You're still fortunate, Joy. Believe me. My laundry. Be satisfied with what you have! - Daddy, someone's looking at us... - Daddy, come here! - from the vacant house! - Denton, the things you see at this hour! - Take a look! - If there's nothing there... you'll both get spanking from me. - Where? - Down in the window. - Down there. - Did you see it, Dad? - Who could it be? - The one in white! - Denton! Ingrid! - Mommy! - Don't look there! - Mommy! Don't look! - Inton, call the guard! - Mommy! Stay here. I'll check it out. Stay here. Mommy will just take a look. Mommy. Denton, keep an eye on Ingrid! Don't follow! This is the village security camera. Looks like he was bitten by a snake! Let's take a look. Why did he videotape us? How did this happen? Who are those people? Only my family and the lawyer were there. Get away from there! - Mommy! - Joy! Not the kids! Joy! - Daddy! - What happened? Where are you? What happened to Mommy? Go away! Joy, what's wrong with you? The security guard, 39 years old, year of the snake. Bitten by a snake. I talked to Evan's wife. She wants the Bagua back. She said it brings good luck. But with it, bad luck too, to whoever sees himself in the mirror. Then last night... lnton... He already hinted... that I should accept his affair with Dina again. Good morning. Mr. Xiu Liao is waiting for you. To my knowledge this Bagua was owned by siblings... in one of the richest families in Shanghai then. When the revolution started and the communists prevailed... the rich and the allies of Sun Yat Sen evacuated. The brother escaped with his wives and children. But he left his sister because he said she was a burden. Now, this sister is what we call Lotus Feet. This is a deep tradition among rich Chinese... where the feet of young girls are bound... and placed inside an iron shoes... to prevent the normal growth of their feet. It was too late when she found out that she was abandoned by her servants. They ran away and joined the communist army. They even led the burning of their Master's mansion. Lotus Feet could not run or walk. She was burned by the fire. They say she was embracing this Bagua... while she was burning. She swore in the mirror before she died. The curse was to get the soul... of anyone who sees himself in the mirror. How many souls will she take before she gets her revenge? Nobody knows. She takes even the non-Chinese? Anybody. Why don't we just break the mirror? Never do that! It will just return to its original state. And if you do that, the soul of the owner will be taken too. Don't attempt anything unless it is the right solution. How can we save those who looked in the mirror? How do we end the curse? I don't know. I will search the answers from the old books. I may have looked in the mirror. Why didn't you say earlier? Because I wasn't so sure. Besides, the old man said he can't do anything. Joy, do you remember... when I removed the Bagua from the door? I think, I looked in the mirror. We don't know who'll be next. Could be you, another guard, or... lnton... or the kids. Alice, I'll stay with you. You stay with lnton and the kids. Let's not leave them. We might be able to help them, just in case. Joy, when you get lucky again, please call me immediately. Because then, we know what follows... the curse. Why are you studying here? Mommy doesn't want us to study in our room. We are really studying. Maybe you're just playing in your room. That's why she wants you to do it here. That's my phone! Hope it's not my Boss. He's been bugging me to accompany his client to a bar. Let me check your assignment. Mommy, I'm not finished. I'm done. Umbrella. Your answer on this one should be "B". Joy, I have to go. I won't be long. I'll just show up. Mommy will get something upstairs. Finish that. Inton, I don't want you to go. This is important, Joy. I don't want you to get hurt. Why will I get hurt? I won't get drunk. It would be embarrassing to the clients. I know it's not work. What are you talking about? What you said last night that I'm lucky you still go home to me. I know you're back with Dina. Joy, what's with you? Where did you hear that? I saw you. You were fetching Dina before you went to La Union. If you had looked around you would've seen me... while you were telling me on the phone that you're on the express highway. I clearly saw you leave the parking lot. Do you know what I felt when I saw you with Dina? I love you, lnton. Your kids love you. I hope you honor your promise that it's over with Dina... because she's married. Leave them with their own lives. They' re separated. Because of you. I'm not the reason, Joy. Then you have to choose. Me and your kids, or Dina? I know you'll choose me because I'm your wife. And Dina has her husband. Must it come to this, Joy? I'm going. Inton, wait! I have to tell you something about what's happening now... but it's hard to explain. You're the one that's hard to explain. Daddy, someone's at the door. Who is it? They're looking for Mommy. Come. Is this the house of Mrs. Joy Ramirez? Yes. We' re sorry to arrive this late. - Your address was hard to find. - Denton, the bike. Sir, we brought her prize. The Home Entertainment showcase. - That's huge!!! - I wonder what's inside them? Mommy, what's this? You won these. We phoned you the other night. Mommy, we're so lucky! Ingrid, Denton, come here! Hurry! Come over here! Here beside me! Denton! Joy! Ma'am, can you please sign here? Sorry to bother you. - I'll have her sign it. - Thank you, Sir. Sign it. Sign it! Now you have material bondage that's hard to fight... because of all the inï¬‚uences. Like greed, lust, vices and more to come. It will hurt your heart. But you have to fight them even if your guilt makes you cry. You really have to plan your next move. Be careful. We're already disturbing them. Hurry up! What's that? Inton, don't got out! You might get hit! Sir, Ma'am, everything's there. We'll go now. Thank you. - Sounds like it came from Billy's! - Ingrid. Denton, come back here! - Denton! - Dad, was it from Billy's? The shot came from Billy's place! He might be hurt! - Denton! - Denton! - Dad, it's Billy! - Denton, come back! - Denton, come back here! - Denton! Denton! Denton! Denton! Denton! Denton! We got to them as they hauled our things. What happened? Burglars entered our house. They took almost all our things. He exchanged gun shots. Two of them escaped in a jeep. Joy, what's with you? The kids are scared. Do you know him? I don't know him. Call the police! Ambulance! He's alive! What's wrong? This is important. Where are you going? What's with you, Joy? Joy! The windows! Just a minute. Hi, Miss Cutie Pie! Drunkards! Losers! Alice, come here. Why? The card... The wind did this to the card. You are a horse, right? Alice... If I'm next, why hasn't Joy called? She agreed to call if she gets lucky again! Alice, we don't know if she did. She's selfish! She doesn't care. - Because all she gets is luck. - Alice... Thelma? What is it? There's... It might be Joy. Alice, wait! Hi, Babes. Oops, you have company. Babes, we ran out of ice... No more ice, Tito. Go to bed. Alice, just ice! I said we don't have any! Ouch!!! Alice! I'm sorry. It's your fault you're drunk! You didn't remove your hand! Alice, what's with you? We're sorry. It was an accident. What accident? She saw my hand at the door! You did it on purpose, you whore! If that's the case, then you're the shit! You bastard! It's your own fault that your hand got slammed. Thelma, come. You can complain to the Police! You arrogant bitch! No good arguing with a drunk. Get off me! Get off me! Thelma, help! Alice! Alice! Tito, what are you doing? Run! Help me! - You can't run away from me! - I didn't mean it! Alice! I didn't mean it! Now, come near me! Go ahead and try! Go ahead and try! Somebody help Alice! You arrogant bitch! Who do you think you are? Just because you're going abroad! Help me! Let go of me! Help! Let go of me! Alice! Alice! Are you sure about this? The ghost was standing there. Your Mommy saw him. Why didn't she tell us? Why didn't you tell me? I promised your Mommy not to tell stories like that. So what happened to the robber? He didn't make it to the hospital. Then he should be here! Most probably, his soul is still roaming around here. Let's call him! Let's ask why he steals. I don't want to! Let's not do it anymore. Don't be a coward! We'll just ask. Count me out. I'm going to bed. Stay here or I'll make the troll get you! I'll have asthma again! You won't if you'll be brave. Billy, hold her. Billy, start now. Don't tell your Mommy. I won't. Let's close our eyes. Spirit, spirit, if you're here... Spirit, spirit, we have a question. I want to pee! Keep quiet. I'm losing my concentration. Spirit, spirit, we have a question. What's your name? Why did you steal? Billy, I feel something. Spirit, spirit, are you here? Answer our question, please? Daddy! Daddy! You're making too much noise. Denton, did you start this? Your teaching your sister nonsense! Billy, I bet you started this! Why hasn't your uncle fetched you? Go upstairs. Go to sleep! Go upstairs! BiHV, you go home! Daddy... Get in! Hurry! Inton... lnton, the kids... Hello, Mother, are the kids with you? And lnton? Where did he go? Why did he take the kids without telling me? What have you done to us? Where is my family? I asked you to cooperate but what did you do? Where are they? You drove away my family. I don't need you anymore! You're useless! Misfortune! Misfortune! Misfortune! Misfortune! Misfortune! Misfortune! - Wake up, Ma'am. - Wake up, Ma'am. Wake up, Ma'am. Wake up, Ma'am. Help me carry her. What happened here? The Bagua, the mirror beside me. Have you seen it? No. What mirror is that? What happened here? Were you robbed? - Where's lnton? - He hasn't returned. - The kids? - Upstairs with your mother. Doctor, she had a fever when she got here this morning. It must be the cause of trauma. - Mommy! - Mommy! I'm sorry, kids. Mommy, I don't like it there. There are so many ghosts! Even Daddy saw them. We saw Aunt Alice. Is Aunt Alice dead? It's all over. Stop crying- That's what I told them. It's over, kids. You're here now. Come on, we're going home. I don't like it there anymore. There are so many ghosts! - Mommy, we saw... - Joy, what are you doing? Wait for lnton to come home. - He instructed... - Why, where is he? He's with Dina, isn't he? If he really cares for the kids, he shouldn't have left them. Let's go! Joy, do you want the children to die? What right do you have to care for my family? You think I've forgotten? Since we got married... you tried to separate us because you like Dina more. Now you try to steal even my children. One of us will die before I ever let you. Denton, Ingrid, let's go! Let's go, Denton! Come outside, Ingrid! Joy, what's with you? Denton, faster! Let's go! - Joy, are you out of your mind? - Ingrid, stop crying! Joy! - Joy! - Mommy! Outside! Inton? lnton! Joy took your children! What will you do? Fight over the kids? - You'll have one each? - What do you want me to do? - Just let her take them! - I know Joy. She'll never let go of what is taken from her. I saw what happened in that house last night. I don't want to endanger my children. I need you here too, lnton, please. I tremble whenever Louie calls. Who knows what he'll do? Look, Dina. I won't be long. In the meantime... don't answer any phone call. Okay? Denton, Ingrid, let's go! - What about my toys? - We'll get it back. - Will we stay there long, Mommy? - I don't know. Come on. Aunt Joy? Can we go biking? Okay. But not too far and don't stay long. Aunt Thelma is coming in one hour. - Yes, Mommy. Let's go! - Let's go! - Don't go near our house! - Yes, Mom! You take care. - Billy, wait for me. - I don't want to! You're so slow. Hurry! Let's go there. Who's this? It's Xiu Liao. Is this Joy Ramirez? Yes. Just say no. What? When good fortune comes, reject it. That will end the curse. The curse will end only if you say no to good luck. Then, destroy the mirror. The curse will end and that will save the next victim. Hello? I heard you. Nobody thought of the solution because it's so simple. I can't believe nobody thought of it. It's not that nobody thought of it. Maybe they just found it hard to let go of good fortune. The boys aren't here yet, but I called the guards. That boy will get it from me. It's almost an hour already. Mommy, you left my toothbrush at home. Ingrid, we'll buy a new one. Get your bag inside. We'll wait for your brother. Here is Jojo's number. He'll expect your call. See if you'll like his condo. Thanks, Teddy. We owe you a lot. No problem. Mr. Roxas! Mrs. Ramirez! Your sons got in an accident outside the gate. - What happened? - Where are they? They were biking in the highway. They got hit by a jeep. Billy is in serious condition. - Oh, my God! - What about Demon? What happened to Demon? Better come with us. Nobody can decide what to do. Mommy... Thelma, take care of Ingrid but don't tell her what happened. Call me, okay? - Yes, just don't leave here. - I'll handle it. Billy! Billy! Mommy! Denton, what happened to you? Why aren't you doing anything? Mommy. Billy. Take him to the hospital. Lift! Lift! All right! Billy is alive. Right, Mommy? - Bring him to the car. - Move! Yes, but we must take him to the hospital. Guard, please take Denton home. Tell Aunt Thelma to treat your wound and tell her I'll call from the hospital. - Okay, son? - Yes, Mommy. I'll take you home, Denton. The boy lost a lot of blood. The problem is his blood type is rare. We have no stock of type AB. We used to get it from the American bases... but there are no more bases now. When now'? The surgeon doesn't want to proceed without blood... or the boy won't survive. - My God! Oh, my God! - What is it? The doctor won't proceed with the operation... without available blood for Billy. Billy's blood type is rare. - Doctor, what's Billy's blood type? - AB. I'm type AB. Take it easy. You lost a lot of blood. Hello. Thelma, I couldn't refuse. The boy's life was at stake. Then I saw lnton. He's next! My God! I have to go to him. I have to help him. You're forgetting he doesn't want to see you. He might misinterpret. Hello? Aunt, was that Mommy? Yes, that was your Mommy. How is Billy? Your Mommy said don't worry, your friend is okay. Sir, Mrs. Joy Ramirez is here. She said it's about your kids. Okay, just a minute. Don't tell her I'm here. I'll call back. Is it Louie? It's Joy. She's in the lobby. She wants to talk about the kids. Don't trust her. Sometimes she scares me too. Ma'am, lobby phone. Hello! lnton! So you took the children from mother. You hid them. That's kidnapping. That's not why I came. Please listen to me first. I went to the house this afternoon. Your things were gone. I went to make sure the children are safe. Lnton, the children are safe. Why will I endanger them? Look. Tell me where they are. And like I promised, we'll talk calmly. When you came, we were just at Teodoro's. The kids are with Thelma now. Is that true, Joy? Lnton, where else will I take them? You know I have no family in Manila. Okay, I believe you. We'll ask the guard to let you up so we can talk. I don't want the children involved in this mess. I don't want them to carry this trauma when they grow up. Reception. Yes, Sir. Ma'am, you may go up to Room 1404. Thelma. Inton already agreed to talk personally. I don't know. I told him where the kids are. You should leave. He might ask his mother to fetch the kids while we talk. It's safer in your house. Because it's near here. I have to go. I'm in the elevator. Let's go. Hurry! Out of order. The fire exit, quick! Let's go! Quick! It's too far here for your Mommy to go back. - She's nearer my house. - Can we visit Billy? Yes, even the hospital is near my house. Inton? Hurry up! Inton! Inton! Something will happen to you! You saw yourself in the mirror! I can save you if... lnton! Inton, please! After the ticket office, I'll check in for us and the kids. Your mother can pick up her ticket at 8:00 am. Let's meet at the airport lobby. Dina! Louie? Inton! Inton... - I have no sin against you! - Why did you come here? Louie? You're Louie! You're lnton's wife? What? You're Joy? Yes, it's me! I'm lnton's wife. Then... you understand me, don't you? - Louie, please? - Right? Do you understand me? Yes, I understand you! They both betrayed us. Louie, please don't! - Please... - You know... there's just one bullet left. - I'm glad I got to know you. - Louie... We can still fix this. You're so lucky. Hello? Thelma, lnton is gone. Aunt, is that Mommy? Yes, Ingrid. Ingrid is playing. Denton is sleeping. What happened, Joy? Louie, Dina's husband... He shot them, then shot himself. My God! Where will I take the kids now? I still have to stay here for a while. It might be better if you take them back home. Okay, Joy. My phone's battery's running out. Hello? Hello, Thelma? Ingrid, when is your birthday? July 10,1991. Year of the rooster. What about your brother? September 6, 1993. Why, Aunt Thelma? We're the same. What a slow vehicle. Thank you. Good morning, Mrs. Ramirez. I'm Atty. Regalado. Lawyer of Mrs. Lily Mendoza. What do you want? Please excuse my dropping by like this. Your place was hard to find. Mrs. Lily Mendoza wants you to consider her offer. She'll give you 5 million cash for the mirror she wants. You look surprised. Even I will be surprised if I get an instant 5 million. No. - Ma'am, I thought... - I refuse your offer, Attorney. I'll raise the offer to 10 million. Cash! Right now! Even if you double it... I will refuse. I know it's hard to understand, but I have to do it. I'm sorry, Attorney. Please leave. I regret I got you. I regret that I ever believed in luck. You took so many lives. You took so many lives! - Mommy! - Mommy! Kids! I was so worried about you. What happened to you? Mommy, there was a big accident in the highway. So many vehicles were in the accident. It's a good thing Aunt Thelma drives well. So many died, even animals! Shhh... Stop it. You're here now. We're here now. No more to frighten us. No more ghosts. Most of all, we're all together now. Is Daddy home yet? Not yet. You're so dirty. Better wash up first. Go change your clothes. Thanks, Thelma. I owe you a lot. No problem. Come, I'll show you something. You broke it? Earlier, a lawyer was waiting for me. He offered 10 million pesos for the Bagua. I refused. Then, I did what Mr. Liao said. I broke it. What's important is it's over. I only have one problem left. How will I tell the children what happened to their Daddy? They already know. Believe me. My only problem now is how to tell you. What will you tell me? Did you tell her already? Almost, but you interrupted. Now you tell her. Thelma... I don't like Listen to your son. Mommy, we have a surprise for you. Ingrid, come out! We were in the accident, Joy. We're among those who died. Bro... Come in. That goes there, by the kitchen. That goes upstairs. You threw the ball too hard! Let's both get it! Quick! What's that? It's a toy. Come on, let's show it to Mommy. Mommy... Mommy!
