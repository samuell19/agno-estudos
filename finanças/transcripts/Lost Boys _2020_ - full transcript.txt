I make my way once again. From the barred steel door to the concrete wall that frames this room. There is no exit, and the fluorescent light is constantly lit. The wall becomes an endless corridor that always ends up where it had begun. Somewhere outside, the cops are going through all the videos I shot... Where my cell phone has been and even all the notes I have made. Looking for evidence that would support their story. But the truth of what happened cannot be seen from the outside. In March, Jani got out of jail. With him and Antti, I traveled to Southeast Asia... to celebrate the occasion. I came back with the return ticket. They skipped the flight to stay in Cambodia. Two months later, they stopped all contact. I return to Bangkok. It has been more than two months since they went missing. On the surface everything looks the same, but the whole place feels completely different... Like an alien landscape. Jani's sister called. She told me that Jani was found dead in Cambodia. Strangled with an electric cord. Antti is hospitalized here in Bangkok after having an epileptic seizure. We just came here to party. Say hello to Santa Claus! Here we are in Thailand. My future wife is here next to me. Life laughs, as you can see. He bring me the ring. See, he show me this ring. And he wear it inside here. The ring is a very big one on my nails, and I told him to wear this size. He have one, I have one. He said: "My darling, this one is very cheap", "but when I come back I will buy you a new one." Something like that. Hey, two beers, coming up. You think my boyfriend is a boy? What? Spice girl? What did you say? You think my boyfriend is a boy so that you can order anything that you want? He's my boy. But he's my husband. You step on me. The door swings both ways. Me and Jani ... Oh yeah? It's like this. When you're speaking to me, it's like this. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Not like, "Oh yeah, oh yeah..." I have my passport in my pocket. I can not... If I go, you go too. - No no... I promise you, you go too. Please, the phone is there, c'mon! This was Jani's first trip outside of Europe. We scored some drugs and hit the red-light district. In the Gogo bars, Jani was all smiles. The girls swarmed us, showing us their bodies and dancing to the pulsating rhythm. You could skip all the courtship rituals with a pile of cash and do whatever you pleased. Line them up, pile their bodies any way you want. Make a fucking pyramid of whores. But it took only a week before Jani was engaged to one of the Gogo girls. Buying her clothes and jewelry. It looked like he was confusing the fantasy for something real. Is it starting to kick in? Don't make the air, OK? Slam, slam, slam. Yeah, baby, slam it. Oh yeah, it's nice. Do it. Finish, finish! You did finish! You have finish it, you know? Now we keep him alive until the day after tomorrow! OK, now it's yours. I'll add a little more. - Okay. I told my husband he have to take it easy, before he... everything. This is kinda nice. Maybe we can help you enjoy doing it all day, all night! All night long! You have so many things to talk. Your mind working very well. Good. - Suck, suck, suck. Suck it. Suck, suck, suck. He pulled everything. - Yes. Now you gonna make "heeheehee" like a mouse. Now you gonna make "heeheehee", like mouse! -Don't release even a little bit. Now, I want him to do it. - Yes. How are you feeling? - It's all good. Yeah, I believe you, for sure. It's so fucking hot in here. It just tastes stronger and stronger. Yeah, it's too hot though, right? For sure. No, no, I don't smoke that shit. - Of course you smoke. No, no fucking way. - Yes, then. It feels good. You smoke it. - No way. Half a pill. You smoke it. Yes, of course. - Never back down, man. Otherwise you will not get a 016 tattoo. Hi, come try it. You will know how it feel like you want to fly. You get some power, and your mind is thinking. There is so many thing to do. Your mind get smart. You think that you know yourself. You are strong, and you got more power. You can kill people very easily. - You will be like me. You go kinda crazy, cuz your mind is all working. Even when sleeping. You try this one, you wake up like, "Mafeee". Gotta have power. Then you become like me. Gotta become like you. Take this thing. Finish it. OK? Finish it. Yeah, baby, finish it. Okay, okay. You will see how he gonna die. The pain pills called Yaba are the most popular drug on the market. It's often used by the construction workers so they can keep working for days. Cops call it the drug of madness, and they're hunting the users like animals. There were rumors of a blacklist of people to be eliminated by the death squads. The meth users are locked up for forced treatments in the concentration camps run by the military. Thousands of suspected drug dealers have been killed. We had to bribe Jani out of trouble a couple of times. But otherwise the drug war seemed to happen in another reality Antti had checked out from the hospital before I got there. I walked through the night, searching the places we used to hang out. One of the Gogo girls from Soi Cowboys had seen him a couple of weeks ago. His face was burned black; his clothes were filthy. His odd behavior had scared her away. She kept on repeating, he was not the same. Eight million people. It's impossible to find him. I check into the hotel we stayed 3 months ago. I send him the location... Hoping he would find his way here. Hi. - Alai. Love. - Love. Wow, I make like this. Crazy! It looks like a woman's part, you know? Yeah, the one you put dick inside. I make it nice. Haha, yeah! You saw it? Yeah, it's the same. That's which is why my husband likes it! Yeah, he's adventurous. He likes to try all the new things. All the new things. And me. The last thing he tried. What am I doing in this hole? I rush to the toilet and vomit, my body convulsing. It doesn't happen too often anymore. Now that the withdrawals are gone, I miss them. There is only this room full of nothing. We grew up in a small Arctic town. Our paths didn't cross until I started to sell hash. They were young criminals doing burglaries and stealing cars, burning all their money on speed and other instant pleasures. We came from different social realities, but there was something in their spontaneous way of existence I admired. The freedom from the norms of society. In the beginning, the guys helped me sell the dope. I had the contacts for distribution and a few junkies to provide the method of transportation. Put it in my mouth. When you fuck, do not just grab somewhere without taking a proper hold, like this. Or you grab here, and pull like this. Do you want to test? - Certainly. An extremely hard and clear feeling. Then Jani and Antti were locked up. I moved away, only going back to bring in the dope. Over the next seven years, I saw them maybe once or twice. Seven years in jail is a long time. People change. We left Thailand and crossed the Cambodian border. There were dealers pushing drugs and prostitutes on every corner. When you met a girl in a nightclub, the next morning you still weren't sure if she was working or not. The line between legal and illegal was ambiguous, but as long as you had money, you were always on the right side of the law. I have the best product. You can test. You like marijuana, speed, opium, cocaine, ecstasy? Come and check. We have everything. What do you want? Buy 10 and get one for free. The eleventh was free. A perfect deal. - Yeah. A blister pack is 500 milligrams, so if I take two, it's a thousand. We'll see what the face looks like after that. Before and after pictures. This is what I look like now. What do I look like afterwards? How many milligrams do you have now? Jani, how many milligrams do you have now? Now I take ... - How much do you have in your blood now? Right now I only have 120 milligrams of codeine. And some trades from yesterday. - Yes, maybe. "Maybe"? You've been taking these for several days! I'll take 1,000 now, and we'll see what happens. If good things happen, I thank God and Angkor Wat Temple and... And pharmacies! I have to pray a prayer for the deceased Tomppa. I prayed for you at Angkor Wat. Amen. Tomppa taught me... about the Buddhist way of thinking. He was one of the NBK bosses. Now he's dead. There are a thousand in a blister pack. Here we are... what should I say... In a small shitty town in Cambodia. We just checked out Angkor Wat. It's going well. The Cambodian shoes are shitty. They have inviting lips. Really. I watched TV... I even saw on TV that Cambodian girls look better than Thai girls. But in Thailand I just happened to meet a cool playboy... player. A playboy girl, damn it. Call it what the hell you want. I could not resist her. I had to play the game with her. We noticed it. That's how it goes sometimes. This is how the pieces move on the board. We players are a family in themselves. Sometimes you have to act boss too. But that's a different story. Tomorrow we go to Phnom Penh, to fuck whores. But say nothing to my Thai girl. That's the way it is. Life laughs. Forward, In children of the same fathers our day of honor has its dawn Tyranny is upon us and raises his bloody standard And raises his bloody standard On your plains the war is alarming and raw jacks shouting For weapons, free men with saber and with plumb line Forward, forward Where were we going the earth shall drink blood We arrived into Phnom Penh during the Khmer New Year. Not knowing the whole town would be dead. All shops were closed. Even the bar girls were out of town, visiting their families. Only the temples were open for business. We were running out of little things, like cold drinks and tin foil. Hold it here and turn it on. Where. No, there on the edge. Lift it upwards. So yes... Ai, fan! It can not handle the heat. I burned my fingers. Where can we get a proper surface? Where. - Never. It will be a terrible brand. Where. It goes from a direct. Then the brand will be bigger. Drive it in there. If the vein dies, it dies. Do not stick from the bottom, stick from the top. Stick from the bottom, then. Blood in, blood out. Ai, fan! You stuck it in the wrong way. Pull back a little. You are difficult to strain. I'm a difficult person. Check this out. - Seriously... Welcome to the club. Your brand is bigger than mine. Damn... - We'll take another round. Now you can manage for a few days... If the pharmacy does not open tomorrow I'll drive the hell in with a bulldozer. I can not wait. 20 stores within 5 meters, and all are closed. I should have brought needles from home. A hockey bag full of needles. "They are for our insulin." "They are for all of us." The marks are damn embarrassing. In jail, Jani had done everything to avoid being labelled a junkie. He told me in prison they are seen as potential snitches. He stopped shooting up, keeping his drug use in moderation. In Cambodia, he picked up the needle again. After a week of waiting for Antti in Bangkok, I gave up and returned to Phnom Penh. I need to know what happened here. There is a picture of Jani's dead body online. It is linked to an article in the Phnom Penh Post. He was never missing. He has been dead for almost three months. I check in to a safe and clean hotel. The police said that it was suicide, but here they often make murders look like suicides. Half a century ago, the Khmer Rouge tried build a perfect society, abolishing money and sweeping out unwanted people. A quarter of the population was killed. When the regime fell, the victims and perpetrators were left to pick up the pieces on their own. Post-traumatic stress disorder was inherited by the next generation. The past of incomprehensible violence sends its echo to the present. Do you know this place? For today I know. I see the people that died. I saw him in... I know... I've seen, you know? But I don't know the story, but I have seen. One person though, on the home. -Yeah, yeah. - In front of home, you know. We can go. Your friend? - Yeah, my friend. I'm sorry. Here. One, three. He stand and sit here. Stood and... You know? I'm afraid. Because you know? You do not know. You're afraid. - Yeah, afraid. Yeah, yeah. Sir, do you know what happened to my friend here? Sorry? - I can not speak English. And the night... One, two, three o'clock in the night it's quiet this way. But over there is a restaurant and bar. But, you know.. this club... him tell me, ah... Maybe, ah... Maybe the robber or someone else... Yeah, maybe the robber kill him... from over there... from over there... And take him here... and do like this, you know? But I don't know. You can ask the police. But here the police are not clear. Do you listen me? Not clear, you know? They are not good. He says that when it happened, the day, he say he stay here, he sleep here. But, he don't know, because of the blind, you know? In the night, in the blind. He tell me, ah, the man that died... have the friend... girl... That the girl cry, cry here. And he say, ah... In his body... Not cell phone, not everything. You know how I say? And have only clothes. You know for I say? -OK. So he had nothing? - Yeah. Not everything. If you have a camera or phone, or a lot of money, you know... The girl can tell the robber, you know... and make the plan for kill. In his last message, Jani told me he's staying at the Lakeside district. It used to be the center of drug tourism. Now the whole area has been condemned to be demolished. They are filling the lake with sand and pumping out all the water. The surrounding slums will be crushed under bulldozers and pavement. The unwanted residents will be relocated. He asked me to send him some money. By that time he had already burned $10,000 in less than two months. He said he was in serious trouble. I never replied. 12 hours later he was dead. The message was written in a cryptic language, like he was under surveillance. There was only a phone number attached. I called the number. A man tells me to come to the Floating Island, a guesthouse at the Lakeside. Yeah, this is the one. You wanna talk with... Ah, what do you want to know? Can you tell us about his last days here? Your friend had a girlfriend, but she says she doesn't know her. So the girl was not here? No, she never come here. That's why he say he doesn't know her. He looked very sad and skinny. Very skinny. The police used to stop him because he smoked meth and yaba. He told us here, like this. And then he left around one or two days, but he still came here. Because he came here to wait for information. He wait for calling. For your calling here, he still came here. He got a friend. He looked like a very good friend. Like very close friend. I do not know how long does he know the friend, but he looked like a very, very good friend. His friend? This was him? Okay. She said, when he stay here he was very skinny. Not like this. He's missing in Bangkok. Missing in Bangkok? - Yeah. His luggage, wallet, and mobile phone are gone. Somebody had claimed and burned his body. There is nothing left of him. Only the stories are still here. His absence leaves a haunting presence. These ones, huh? Shall I fix you a whole dose? Divide the half into two parts, so it becomes a quarter. Take it in two parts for safety. Yes, daddy. No, I'll take everything at once. They had been high on speed 24/7, constantly bickering about stuff back home. Jani's drug use was sliding out of control. I picked up a random bar girl to give him something else to think about. The bar girl he fell in love with. The girl crying at the site of his death. She said her name was Lee Lee. OK, smoke now. - Yeah, yeah. Smoke. What's up?! You smoke. If you not smoke, I go. You're trying to poison me. You are bad people, No, I'm just kidding. Gimme all you got. I'll smoke. - You not smoke, are you? Do you smoke? Come on. She kept him in an infantile state... In a bubble of satisfaction. He was pouring all his money on her and the drugs they smoked. Once I told her that she could push him out of control with his addiction. The next day she and Jani moved to another hotel. Excuse me... - Marijuana? No. I'm looking for this girl. Her name is Lee Lee. She used to work in Walkabout and... You want to see her? Maybe she can come to him, dancing. If you see her, you call me. Did she rip off some one... - No. Do you remember that Finnish guy who hung himself? I remember a man who got shot. You have to be so careful here, man. Very careful. Some of these girls, they'll fucking murder you. A girl in Martini Bar said she knew her. She said Lee Lee could be from a slum called K-11. It used to be infamous for its child sex trafficking. Now there are only the poor, the drug dealers, and the criminals. Excuse me, have you seen this girl? Lee Lee. -No, no. Lee Lee or Nee. You can... - No. No. - No. Lee Lee. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? I need to imagine some horizon. A life beyond these walls. It is four months to July. Four months to the trial. I press my head against the stone wall, imagining the waves of time slowly eating away the concrete. My lawyer calls. The cops have managed to postpone the trial. They need more time to go through all the video footage and surveillance data. It feels like you never get out of this place. I tried to dream about the life outside, but the walls are growing thicker. The whole world is filled with concrete. The city is awake at the early dawn, and the people are gathering around fires in the temple. At dusk, the borders between reality and the underworld dissolve. The smoke of hell money enters the realm of restless spirits. I'm burning a pile of paper. An unfair exchange for the $5,000 I failed to send him. I'm pushing through a crowd in a nightclub. I suddenly see a familiar face through the smoke and strobe lights. It's Thee, a friend of Lee Lee. We used to party with her. She looks at me with her eyes wide open. One or two night before he died, he go Sharky's. He go Sharky's and he walk... he could not walk. Very bad way, you know? He shaking. And I think he find, after when he died, some girl tell me, he tried to find hamburger. He liked to eat hamburger in there. And he went to go there, but he don't have money. And when he go there, alone, and very bad... Cannot walk even. I see him 5 minute. He leave, after he come in five minutes. He look at menu. Maybe expensive. That's why he leave. That's the last time I see him. After two days, about two o'clock at night, when I come back from Martini, one of the girls say, "Thee!" You know boyfriend Lee Lee boyfriend hung he... "He killed his self. " And first, because too many Lee Lee, yeah? I don't know who Lee Lee. And I just thinking about Lee Lee, my friend, and I just start walk away, you know. But she came over talk me. She said, "Do you know Lee Lee? No No?" "Yes I do." I called her Nee Nee. "My God, what, what?" Said, "He killed his self." And many people want to go look, but I scared, you know. I don't go to look. I look maybe by tomorrow. Scared. Did not want to look. And after Antti... I see him about one month after, in Lakeside. I say, "Antti, what you doing here?" You know Jani is dead?" And he said, "Yes, I know." And he not say anything. He say, "Can you give me number for phone for you?" I want to call you, I don't have money. Everything I don't have." I say, "OK, if you need any help, you call me, okay?" You need food, you need something? You call me." He called me when I had customer here. I could not come... Antti. And one time... I go with customer near Lakeside... I see Antti, sleep outside in the street. That's why I thinking, I say, okay maybe afternoon I come back, I get him go to my (?????). Come back, not see him again. When you here, they always want to fighting, see? The problem I think is, ah, Jani don't speak English, you know? He can hear English, but he not speak many words English. Not same you, not same Antti. When he get the money from you, he don't tell Antti. He and Lee Lee go, and forget about Antti, forget about me and Lee Lee's sister. And just go for another guesthouse. I think one time she get out about $1,200, and spend everything in 48 hours. Can you believe it? That's when Antti, he very, very fucked him up, you know? He say, no see Jani go out of his house, ah, the hotel, no see Lee Lee in 49 hours. And after Jani come to Antti and say, she take out $1,200. And she not have money in her body after 48 hours. Where the money go, I don't know. Yes, it's true. Why do you think Jani killed himself? - No. He had no reason to, you know. Because he say... In Pin Hotel, many girl tell me... It's... and Lee Lee also tell me... you will send money to him very soon. In two days. In two days you send money to him. So, no reason he kill himself. And also, new people come and say have something hit him behind here. You know? He be hang up. Something broke and something... And, they... and also the police say not kill self... Some people kill him or hang him like this, you know? Not he kill himself. If he still in love with Lee Lee, how come he kill himself, you know? Maybe because Lee Lee didn't love him. - No. He knows... She bad the way she spend money, but she loved Jani, you know. She love, yeah. I think she love him. She speak about him every time she... I can see in her eyes that, you know, she feel something. And if Jani not see her, he not stay in Cambodia. If he be with other girl else, he not hear the story from Lee Lee when she young, when she small. Exactly the same him, so for sure he don't fucking care, you know. He don't care. So, he can go short time... Like what you do with every girl, you know. And forgot about this, and just go back to Finland. But for Lee Lee, somehow she lucky, and somehow she know how to play the game with the men, you know. She very smart for playing men to make money. But she needs more, yes? She don't care. What she do, this, can make you feel bad, can make you feel sad, you know? Even very best friend with her. She just care about smoking. She young, but I'm... me... sometimes I feel sad for her also, though. She very young. She very young. She no come from a good family. She no have mother or father or good sister or good brother. She also very sad life, you know. That's why I tried to help her... But now I finished. I don't want. She never change. Lee Lee is Lee Lee, you know. She don't want to change. She don't want to be some better like. The minute she know you, the minute she talk with you, it means she start game already. In a bar, everywhere, every girl. Sometimes some girl she... she keep the guy for long time. So, for can be long time. But you like, by the way, Lee Lee, it means she don't fucking care the guy tomorrow. It's just care... I want to take all your money from today... And tomorrow you can leave. Many young girls... They just thinking what they have now, in the minute, you know. They not thinking in the future, or something. But if people who work a long time, like me, different. We know more. They know how to tease the guy for... Take money from the guy. Every girl is different way, you know. For sure they never tell the truth about their business, you know. Same with you. You never tell the truth. How, which way you can make money. You don't want to play here, and you not come to Cambodia. And when you come to Cambodia, for sure you have to play the game. You never find out the truth, you know. You need die and you go to see God. Ask God why. He have answer for you. Even her best friend hasn't seen her. The are two people missing who might know something about his death. If Antti knew about it, why didn't he call anyone? Why did he keep living on the street? Maybe he ended up killing Jani. Yep. It really is not wheat flour. It tastes like chemicals. - Download the filter. Download the filter! - Yes, yes, take it easy. He always has to fuck ... - Söla. Yes Yes. Take it easy, Jani. - You get pissed ... I do not remember where I put the cigarettes! Over there is a package! I have a filter bag too. - Shitty! I usually use Ventti filters. I've been walking around for two hours ... Is it my fault? How much does it contain? What did he say? It should be one gram of powder. I see that it is. Or how, Jani? I see it in the thickness of the bag. I've filled enough bags to see it. We have to cook the next one. - Yes. How much did you pay for it? - 60 for everything. Is it stuck on the edges? Yes. I told you it had to be boiled. Divide it into two parts now only. Then we drive. Wait until Jani is done. I do not want to drag on two types. Wait... He has to push it in slowly. - Wait. Seriously, wait a minute. If the effect is bad, then ... I push it in very slowly. The light stays on 24/7. Sleep doesn't feel like real sleep. But still you never feel like you're really awake. This place is designed to break you down. To turn your mind against yourself. They find nothing from the videos. But after a month of isolation, one of the dealers has broken down, sending a domino effect of arrests. They tell any story just to get out. The cops give false testimonies just to fill in the blanks, and after a while, you can't tell the truth from a lie. It might take years to get out. I see constant daydreams and nightmares, where I torture and kill the snitch. I got a message from Antti. He's still in Bangkok. He says he has been asking for me at the hotel I was supposed to be. I reply to him that I'll be back there as soon as I can book a flight from Cambodia. I arrive at the hotel, but he's no longer here. I check in to the same old room. I send him my phone number, but he doesn't call. I wait. There is nothing else to do. "Hej!" - Alai. Love. - Love. I made this. Crazy! It looks like a snippet. Yeah, the one that put dick inside. I make it nice. Yeah! Yeah, it looks the same. That's why my husband like it! He likes to try all the new things. And me. The last thing he tried. This is how he gonna die. You can kill people. You will be like me. You go crazy, your mind is all working. Then you become like me. Right. I've been here a week. The days become all blurry. The whole existence is diminished to a series of nightmares and meaningless repetition of routines. I sleep with a knife at an arm's length. Finally he calls. He sounds like nothing has happened. Damn, what a trip. I've slept on the streets here. No, fan ... Now I sleep with a family close by. You look good. I've given up all drugs. I've been in shock. The days in Cambodia are merging. We were so on fire all the time. When was the last time I saw Jani? No clue. It was suicide according to the police. But you saw him, you probably know about ... He had marks here. As if he had been strangled with clothes. As if he had fought against - for the brands rose upwards. I do not know how it happened ... First he tore himself here and then he was strangled. The marks were quite large. There was nothing here. Though I just checked quickly - because I almost fell to my knees when I saw him. When we went to Riverside - I got really bad vibes. There were shady types everywhere. A gang was leaning against a car. Everyone had knives in their hands. Two drove past with a moped, one showed his gun. He could have shot me. Jani noticed nothing. I thought this was going to end badly. They must have been Lee Lee's friends. Someone must have told them. She must have dumped her debts on Jani. I told Jani we should not hang out with them. Because otherwise it can end badly. "Come on, we're steaming." But Jani did not want to. Lee did not give a shit about Jani. She did not have to be so emotional. She had not had to fuck him up completely. Jani did not understand the situation - because he was so in love. He probably believed me when I said - that the gang we hung out with was bad company - that we had hung out with them for too long. Forget Lee. I mean it. She's a fucking whore. Do not go and visit her. She likes a trap. You can buy information - but you should not wave money. "Here you have money, can you find out one thing?" It wont pay off. Do you know what would be better? Pay someone there. You know what would happen to her ... That would end well. It is bad. There is no freedom of thought here at all. One should not think about what happened. Listen. If you commit a series of crimes - you have to be damn calm to do that. If you think about the crime even a little - then they take a picture immediately. There are a hell of a lot of scouts here. Cops. They are called mirrors. They mirror and photograph people. They wear contact lenses, change clothes. There are a hell of a lot of mirrors. People do not know that they are wearing transmitters. They can listen to us now if they want. We send a signal all the time. Everyone is doing it. It turns on when you walk through the airport gate. They can see through our eyes. They are called the rulers. There in Sky ... So they take a picture of your thoughts - and use it as evidence in court? You end up in jail because of your thoughts? Only if it's true. Then it's over. Sky is like a company. They are cops. Sky. They are called Sky People. That thing about going into people's heads ... Yes? - It sounds crazy. Yes, it sounds very crazy, but it's true. It sounds sick. I also thought "what the hell?" - but they are everywhere. We had two large ones outside the apartment. It's a radio mast. But is it a radio mast? That's another name for them. Check how many there are. That sounds crazy. That is, it makes sense. It makes sense, believe me. It sure sounds crazy - but this is it. That's been the case for a long time. He has been living on the streets for months with no money. He seems to be in a paranoid psychosis. Without the benefits of corruption, there are real reasons for paranoia. Maybe his days haven't been so different from his dystopian visions I need to find Lee Lee, but the state Antti is in, he can't remember much. Only the name of the park where they scored drugs with her. I book him a flight back home and return to Phnom Penh. The rainy season is coming to its final peak. The Mekong is overflowing, forcing the smaller river to flow in the opposite direction. Repeating its cycle once again. The king is here watching the rowing competition, like the kings before him. I need another line... The streets are packed. It's hard to press through the crowd. The sheer amount of people makes the atmosphere suffocating. Hello. Excuse me, ah... Have you seen this girl? Do you know her? He's know this girl. Can you help me to find ... - My friend. -My friend, yeah. Where can I find...? He's can find for you. But tip...? - Yeah, yeah, I'll tip. You get money if you find her. What tip you give for his...? How much do you want? Like, five dollars? Ten dollar? 15 dollar? They promise to deliver her to the Nagaworld casino in one hour. What is it you want to talk? Why I kill him? For what? - For money. He no have money. Why I kill him? Jani, even him owe money. I did not want to pay. Because they didn't know Jani. Anyone have problem, me have problem, not Jani. I'm the one owe him, not Jani. Do you understand? Did he owe some money? - No. Me the one owe, not Jani. Jani didn't know anybody in Cambodia. He know only me. Me, I'm born Cambodia. I know everybody. They kill the people, they buy them long time... The old customer, yeah, they kill the old. Why they have to do with Jani? Him not same as any guy; very dangerous guy. He want to kill himself many times. I help him two time already. Once time at the guesthouse, him take a razor, you know. You understand? Then he went crazy - and tried to cut himself. He cannot control him body. He said it very hurt in the body. He tell me, him thinking: "Where is Antti, where is Antti? I want to go find Antti." After that, he take that one... I thought him joking. He not do yet, he just already make me scared. If I not stop him, him die by the time already. Even though I hadn't known him long time, I had feelings for him. That's why I can't forget him. We have money, we have fun together. Even no money, we stay together. It was not same every taxi girl. You're lucky. Some taxi girl are not good lady. That's why some girl say, she taxi girl, she not bad. I'm not a bad person. I'm a bad person, Antti and Jani maybe die long time already. When you go. I cry. I say, "Jani, I very scare. I worried." "Tomorrow, what we do? How we can find money to buy food?" Him hold on me and say, "You don't need to scared. Everything be okay". Then I give him to send email for you. Him always sit down email... 5 minute. I dunno what happen with him. And he just start... go. I say, "Why? What happen? Why you not send email." He no say anything, just, you know, very tired, wouldn't say something, wouldn't talk with me, you know. And when I go working taxi girl, I take care of him, and and I not angry with him... I happy to do, you know, for the people that I love. That's why I asked him, I say, "Jani, you love me?" He say... Same. Every time I ask him, he not answer me. But I can see it. When I cry, Jani cry. When I lay down to cry, he cried too. I do not know how long Buddha can get me find a good guy like Jani. Even if find, not same Jani. I want the same thing before. You know, I cry every morning... Every day I lay down in bed. I'm thinking of Jani. Him holding me, then I feel very comfortable when sleeping. I gonna smoke shit, but I can't sleep too without him around. When Jani isn't holding me, I cannot sleep. Just make me numb, or something. Too bad. I had many thing bad life. Maybe that's why I can cry easy. People who do not have bad life, they cannot cry like... I start to go up, my sister start to fuck my life up really. Before, I never cry easy at home. Many thing bad to me. Thing I tell you, even now I die, my family didn't know, too. Can I do a little bit? Can I smoke a little bit? I don't know how long I can find a good guy like Jani again. Very long time. I find a good guy before I start to working... Until I get 22 already. Just meet a guy same Jani not now. My dream... my dream not come true. I want to have house, grow a little. Stay together, in the morning, when the sun go up. Drink coffee, have a lot of romantic things. Maybe next life. I hope. Maybe we make baby, whatever. Baby would play around. Me start to get old, not start to get younger. But when we smoke, we have fun. We enjoy. Love, love, love. We start all day, all night in the bed. We not feel yet pain. That is why they say: "Smoke shit, doesn't look like shit." You know, don't forget this one, OK? Tell you, I smoke; it only make me enjoy, have fun. Enjoy my day, and I don't want to think something is at the end of my mind. It's like, even you. You see, sometimes you wanna get something a little bit... You will laugh, you enjoy. Right? - Yeah, that's right. But with Jani it was different. He had big problem. Him thinking about all the drug... About Jani, Antti go away with him thinking. Nobody talking with him. And him stay at home everyday. Then we speak in the Cambodia with my friend, with my sister... He not answering. Him thinking him call you, you not answering. Many things, not all about drugs, Jani, you know? Not only drugs. There's been some accident on a bridge leading to the nearby island. 300 people are dead. I lay on the bed and watch the bodies being carried away on TV. What the fuck am I doing here? Something to clear? Medications? - No. Do you have medication? Come here with the camera. Can we include Neuvonen in the picture? Zoom in on Neuvonen. Jonah. They arrest me for drug trafficking. I have been under surveillance for several years. They gave me this room of my own. Everything is safe and clean. The food is decent. The AC keeps the temperature at the same comfortable level. Plenty of light 24/7. From the outside, everything seems perfect. When Jani got out of here, he wasn't the harmless junkie I once knew. He seemed to be out of control. He stabbed someone in the middle of a crowd. I thought he was going crazy. I could see him coming back from Cambodia as a homeless addict, asking for a place to stay and money for a fix. I wanted him to vanish. When I left them there, I knew something would happen. And when he disappeared... Deep down I knew he was gone. The truth is, I wanted him to die. Frej GrÃ#nholm Swedish Media Text Translation of MarseljÃ¤sen: Carl Vilhelm August Strandberg
