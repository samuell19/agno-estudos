Organizing is a practice. And like with any practice, we can't only be in it for the results. We have to find meaning in the mission. Otherwise, we'll just give up when things get messy again. The act of organizing has to feel essential. Something that makes us feel alive, in control. Our things take on meaning by how and where we keep them, right? So if you think about it, tidying creates value, it's not just a means to an end. Tidy makes meaning. Don't just like the look, love the process. And now, back to this week's organizing challenge. Hi. Oh... Becca, you scared me. I was wondering what you were doing here so late. Wait, how did you know I was here? I have that tracker on your phone, remember? Since you insisted in case I can't get a hold of you and I need the client's address... Right. Wait, why are you here so late? Have you ever tried to stay ahead of you? How was yoga? It's about as productive as our calendar. You know once I get started, it's hard for me to stop. Meels, are you too afraid to go home? Did you know who created a new user account? Same name. New numbers. He's a creep. I'll block him over and over again if I have to. Seriously? This has to stop. You need help moderating the comments before they hit the blog. I'm happy to do it. I am not going to let some troll dictate how I work. Chaos is not some random troll. You have to draw the line at getting stalked, being threatened. I mean, you said it yourself. You saw someone outside many times. And that's exactly why you shouldn't be here by yourself, especially, late at night. Thank you. But let me take care of me. It's my job to take care of you. Oh. Speaking of, they came for you. It looks personal. - There's no return address. - Mm-mm. It's from my ex-boyfriend's wife. Is that a good thing? What does it say? Read it. "Dear Amelia, you're going to think I'm insane." It's Liv. I'm married to Mark Callahan. I realize we've never met, but I've heard a lot about you. I'm terminally sick, and I'm writing because I know what you and Mark had was special. I don't know if he'll recover after I go, and I'm realizing now that my dying wish "is for you to be there for him..." "That maybe you can give him a happily ever after," someone else to live for, or some hope at least. He so desperately needs it. I pray this finds you well and open-minded. It would mean the world, even just a hello. "Sincerely, Liv." It's kind of romantic, in a morbid way. Some terminal woman asks her husband's ex to get back with him? It's so selfless and awful. Clearly, she thinks something's there. Is there? - We were together in college. - Was he your first love? Yeah, very much in love. - And then? - And then my mom got sick. I dropped out to take care of her, and I just left. - I didn't tell him. - Oh. I know, it's the worst thing I've ever done to someone. But I knew if I had to tell him... I wouldn't be able to go. Honestly, I'm surprised she thinks I'm so special to him. I figured he'd hate me by now. - And you never saw him again? - No. I started Squirrel right after my mom died. Obviously, I threw myself into my work... What would I even say to him? Crazy. Wow. So close. Hooks are your friend in a kitchen like this. No more prying spatulas out of a crammed drawer. - Why didn't I think of that? - It's easy to get stuck. That's what you hired me for. Well, that, and I am your biggest fan. Aww. Thank you. Actually, I was gonna talk to you about maybe coming over again this weekend, perhaps helping me with my wine collection? That rack is just, it's too cluttered for the space. We could drink some wine, you could tell me all about your business venture. I might even wanna invest, you never know. Thank you. But maybe next week? This weekend is a bit tough for me. And, actually, I have to leave soon for a funeral. Oh. I, I'm so sorry. I-I didn't know, I... It's okay. Have you seen my assistant? And I just love using mason jars as desk organizers. They're super rustic, easy to clean. You can put paperclips in them. There you are. Nice work in here. Good job. - Thanks. - We gotta go. Now? Your next thing's not until 2:00. Shoot. I forgot. - Who's that with? - That new client I found. Forrest Jacobs. I think you're gonna like him. Can we push? I forgot to tell you it's Liv's funeral today. - You're actually going? - I guess so. Good for you. Well, why don't you go ahead and I'll finish up here and maybe I can even start on the basement? I don't think you're ready to be at a client's alone just yet. You have to earn client trust. And, uh... Gwyneth is a bit particular. I'd feel better if we came back together. - Okay. - Okay. Liv loved to write. One of her favorite things to do was to reflect on the world and put it on paper. As her condition got worse, she couldn't go outside, so she wrote them to me even. Called them Postcards From The Bedposts. I'd like to read one. "Dear Mark, the weather here is stunning." And the views of our yard, you wouldn't believe. There's this really cute guy here who brings me food and makes the bed. He kind of does everything. I can tell that he's sad, and I wish I knew how to cheer him up, but I'm afraid I might be the reason why he feels that way. I miss you. "I wish you were here." I never got to give this to her. "Dear Liv, I'm so glad you're being taken care of." But one thing I know for sure, there's no world where you make someone sad. I'd say, the guy helping you is just... is just afraid of the day that you have to leave. "But until then, he's the luckiest man alive." I love you. I can't believe it. How did you... - That was beautiful, Mark. - How did you know about this? Uh, I saw the obituary. I'm so sorry. Do you live nearby? I didn't know we were so close. Yeah. Crazy coincidence, right? Sorry to interrupt. I'm Liv's sister. - Do we know you? - Vicki, this is Amelia. - An old college friend. - Amelia? Oh. Did you know my sister? I did not, unfortunately. But I'm so sorry for your loss. Yeah. Same. Look, you and I still need to talk about some things alone. Can we talk about this later, Vick... Her little safe. I have the extra key. You know she wanted me to have it. - I'm sorry, Vi... - I can go upstairs. Right now and get it. I know exactly where it is. I will bring you whatever you want. I just need some time, okay? Fine. Sorry about that. She can be a bit intense. I think she's struggling with money and she thinks Liv has some sort of nest egg, but it's not true. Well, it is a hell of a lot to go through, though. Uh, maybe I can help with that. I've worked with grieving clients. I know it can be hard, going through everything. I'd love to help you, whenever, free of charge. That's my cell. Thank you, really. And for coming. Uh, I should go. - It's really good to see you. - Yeah. Means a lot. And I just love using mason jars as desk organizers. They're super rustic, easy to clean. You can put some paperclips in there. - Morning. - Morning. Nice blog post you put up without talking to me about it first. People were asking for a post on desk space. And you thought I'd be okay with you posting without asking me first? Recording a client's house without permission? What did I say about client relationships? You said "clear the day." And I didn't wanna bother you. I swear, I was just trying to help. Okay, but I need you to do your job, not mine. And especially, not without asking. I'm sorry, but it's really frustrating sometimes. I've been your assistant for three years. And when you hired me, you said that there was room for growth. You went about this the wrong way. Look, I'm sorry. I love your ambition. And I never wanna suffocate that. But Squirrel is my baby. I get that, but I care about it and have put a lot of time into this company, too. I have hundreds of ideas. I think I could bring something really great to the table. I know you can be more, Becca. But now's just not that time. Not after that blog post. Or maybe you're just mad that people actually liked what I had to say, or that miraculously, Squirrel didn't crash and burn when you were away for a day. Are you serious with me right now? There. It's deleted. I'm sorry. I'm gonna work the rest of the day from home. Why don't you take a half day in the morning to think about what you did and what you just said to me? I hear someone found a dead animal in a drawer? Oh... Thank you so much for coming. I really didn't know who else to call. Here I thought I'd be the one helping you, and now this. Don't worry about it, I'm grateful to get out of the house for a minute. I've, uh, barely moved at all lately. So what's the deal with this creep? Chaos, we call him. Or that's what he calls himself online. He's been at it on the blog for a while, but this is the first time it's crossed over into real life. - Hm. - At least, I think. My assistant thinks I'm being watched. - You're being watched? - Maybe now I agree. I'm happy to help you at home, too. Thanks. So, pretty gruesome, huh? Be glad it was a squirrel and not you. So who else has access to this space? Uh, Becca, my assistant, and me. There was no sign of break-in? - No. - And you trust your assistant? - Of course. - Where is she now? Well, normally she'd be here, but we got into a bit of a disagreement yesterday. You should get your locks changed. Maybe hold on to the keys yourself. - Mm-hmm. - You're taking the right steps. But these things tend to escalate. Keep an eye on who tries to get close. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello! - Hi. - Hi. - Can I help you? I have a 10:30. Forrest Jacobs. Right. It's 10:30 already. Wow. - Would you like me to wait? I... - No! Um... - Amelia Sommers. - Oh, pleasure. Hi. - Conference room? - Great, yes. Here, I'll get the door. So, tell me everything. - Okay. Everything? - Mm-hmm. Okay, how do I put this? Um... I feel, I-I feel a bit haunted in my own home. Yeah, by, um, by different versions of myself that, uh, that I've never become. And by that you mean... Okay, for example, uh, at one point I wanted to become a painter, so I bought a stack of canvasses and all the colors of the acrylics. That didn't happen. Uh, same way I tried gourmet cooking. Uh, pottery, photography, karate. And now it's just, it's, this is all there squatting all day. - And what do you actually do? - I'm a publisher. Uh... Yeah, provide a pipeline for the real experts. You could say that without someone like you, no one would be able to explore their curiosities. - That's something. - Wow. I, I didn't know this, uh, came with therapy. Thank you for that. - Or is that extra? - Organizing digs deep. Yeah. Good thing I have a lot of shovels. Oh, it's a gardening phase. Well, I would love to help you make space for yourself. - The real you. - The real me. Thanks. I'm sorry for the no-show yesterday afternoon. I needed a full day to really move past it. There was a dead squirrel in my desk drawer yesterday morning. What? - Are you okay? - I don't know. - I didn't sleep last night. - Do you think it was him? Who? Chaos? Yeah. I do. Well, maybe it's time to start taking action against this psycho, like I've suggested a hundred times. Start moderating your website. I offered to help. My offer stands. Wait, how did you get in here? I had the locks changed yesterday. I thought my key felt weird when I came in. But it wasn't locked. It was open. Anyway, you probably just left it open when you came in this morning. But, you know, we might need more than new locks if you wanna stop someone twisted enough to leave a dead squirrel in your desk. - Hello. - Hi. - Uh, Amelia and... - Becca, my assistant. I believe you guys spoke already? Oh. Sorry. Uh, yes, we, we emailed. - Hi. - Hi. Um, I-I was just expecting you. I'm admittedly OCD, uh, about guests, you know, considering the mess. Of course. Will you give us a minute? - Sure. - Thanks. It's fine. I'll be fine. I'll wait out here. I'm so sorry. Can I buy you dinner? I know you don't wanna talk about us, but I do. You don't deserve this. And you're right. I do need you. And I don't wanna lose you. Not as a colleague, and especially not as a friend. Would you mind just waiting here? - No, it's okay. - Okay. I won't be long. Great. Hi. - Can I take your bag or... - Oh, I'm okay, thank you. Here we are. I've never been in a client's house that's neater than mine. I thought you said this place was a mess. Um, are you not seeing the amount of useless things in the house? Yeah, but it's all so tidy. Well, thank you, uh... Are those nunchucks? Why, yes. Part of your karate phase? - Hm. - Yeah. Oh, I love those shelves. I featured them on my blog once. Yeah, you'll, you'll see a lot of Squirrel around here. I've been following you for a little while. Just a bit of a lurker. Oh. That's nice. You didn't mention that in our meeting yesterday. Oh, I... Should I have? No. No, it's fine. So where is this overstocked book collection you talked about? Yes. It's, um, out back. - I'll show you the way. - Okay. Uh, most of these I've published or they're by authors I've published or hope to someday at least. - Are they all non-fiction? - Advice and self-help. Some academic and, um, crafts. Hence the hobbies. And I dabble in memoir as well. - What's this about? - Oh, well, wow. Here. You take it. It's a beautiful and soulful meditation on calligraphy. - Calligraphy. - Yes. You'll love it. You'll weep on it, I swear. Maybe you don't feel like yourself in here because you've kept what you are out here. All this needs to come inside. You need to be surrounded by your books. You just gasped and clutched your heart at the mention of calligraphy. - I did, didn't I? Yeah. - Mm-hmm. I can't imagine what these other books do to you. Uh, uh... Okay. - Right? - You might be right. We've got our work cut out for us. - Yeah, we do. - Mm-hmm. - Where do we start? - Hm. You're important to me, Becca. I don't wanna fail you. And you're right, I have prioritized everyone in my life when you're the one who's cared about me the most. Okay. Well, now I can't be mad. It's just, after all this time, I feel like I'm only three things for you at work, your assistant, not good enough and a threat. And that hurts, especially since we're friends. I am so sorry. This is Mark. - He wants me to come over. - Did you hear what I said? Just one sec, Bec. Okay. I'm sorry, what were you saying? How about we hire an assistant for both of us so I can start taking on sales, marketing strategies, and ways to help us grow? And maybe even a couple of commercial clients, too? I guess I need to look at that prospectus you made still, but I was thinking in the meantime, like, maybe we start a Becca page and you can do your thing there. Do my thing on a Becca page? Yeah, that could be fun, right? - Like, a way to get your feet... - You know what? Forget it. I gotta get home. You do your thing. Becca, wait. Who's there? Hello? And you don't know who's harassing you online? Who left this dead squirrel, you say, in your office? - I have no idea. - No angry clients? - Perhaps, an angry employee? - No. - None that I can think of. - Okay, then. We'll talk to your neighbors in the a.m., see what they heard or saw. In the meantime, let us know if anything comes to mind or if you find that something's missing. You okay? You want us to call anyone? No. I'm okay. All right. Get those locks changed. And maybe think about getting a security system or an alarm, would you? Of course. Thank you, detective. - Hello? - Hey. I'm sorry. I know I said I'd leave you alone. No. It's-it's okay. Are you all right? I'm sitting outside my house. I can't go inside. - It's too quiet in there. - Of course. I'm sorry. You hardly know me now. - Is this weird? - No. I'm actually glad you called. Are you okay? You sound upset. You don't need to hear this. No, it's fine. What's wrong? There was an intruder in my house tonight. The police just left. I'm literally sitting in my kitchen terrified. I don't even think I can move. Hang tight, all right? I'll be there in a second. No, no, you don't have to do that, please. It's too late. I'm already on my way. Just text me the address. They didn't take anything? I don't think anything's missing. Why does that make me feel worse? Well, you can't apply reasoning to this, trust me. Someone might feel wronged by you. They might want something from you. Or, perhaps, it could have nothing to do with you. Maybe they realized I don't have anything. Not at all. You're just charismatic, smart, funny. Successful? Or maybe you're just the perfect target. Yeah. You're the only person who can make me feel charmed by saying something like that. - College? What's that? What... - Oh, nothing. Oh, this is so embarrassing. Wow, look at us. Who were these kids? I was gonna be an FBI agent. You were gonna be this big writer. Right. What is that? It's nothing. Clearly not nothing if you thought it might have been missing. It's just this book I've been working on. You wrote a book? What's it about? - It's boring. - Stop. Tell me. It's this... memoir slash lifestyle something or other. I don't know. I can't get out of my head about it. Probably never be finished. Well, to be honest, I was surprised of you becoming the Miss De-Clutterer. Yup. That's me. I mean, it's great. Just not how I thought things would end up. Yeah, me neither. It's why I put so much into the blog. Became my only outlet after the writing process stopped being my friend. - Why's that? - I don't know. After my mom died, and I was cleaning out her house, I became obsessed with neatness. I couldn't function unless every detail was impeccable. Suddenly I couldn't write the same way anymore. There's no clear answer to what goes where. You can't color-code a memoir. And there's no immediate gratification to a story that always feels so incomplete. I got stuck. - So I stopped. - Hm. But I was sick about it, you know, abandoning my dream. That's when I started the blog. I figured if I could write about organizing other people's lives and stopped worrying so much about my own, that maybe that would fix things. And did it? You must be exhausted. Thank you so much for coming. Where will you go tonight? - You know you can't stay here. - Uh, right. Get your things. You can stay at my place. - I have a spare room. - I'm fine. - I can just stay at the office. - With the dead squirrel? Really? I wasn't sure what you'd want, so I brought a little bit of everything. What? Is that white chocolate? You are the only person to this day who likes white chocolate over original chocolate. And you just happen to have some lying around? To be honest, you hooked me back in college. You know, I'm feeling better already. Good. Hm. Oh, no way! Yeah. They got married. Well, they're divorced now, but it was a wild night. You'd gone by then. This has been so nice. Thank you. I don't know when the last time anyone did this for me. I'm glad you let me. - Oh, no, no, no, no, let me. - No. Stop. Come on, I feel guilty enough already. Please, you have no idea how good it feels not to be fussed over the last few days. You not helping helps me. I swear. Well, just know that it's extremely hard for me to watch you do all this. - It goes against my nature. - And why's that? I'm used to doing everything myself. You're used to it or you insist on it? - Ah. - You got to be careful. Making people need you like that. I don't make people need me. You do have a way, though, making people feel like they wouldn't know what to do without you. I know I've felt that. Can I ask? Why did you leave? Uh... I just felt really overwhelmed after my mom got sick. And what we had was... I would have understood. I'm not saying it was the right choice. But at the time, it felt like the only option I had. You could have come back, after. Did I do something wrong? Of course not. I was afraid of losing myself again... the way that I always did when I was with you. Ame, I really loved you. You know? But that was a long time ago. And things change for a reason, I guess. Maybe we should just stick to being friends? Yeah. Morning! Or afternoon. - Hi. - Going somewhere? I'm actually late for a meeting. Oh. Um, all right. - No worries. I'll, uh... - You know what? I can reschedule, it's no big deal. - Really? - Yeah. - Okay. All right. - Okay. - Hey. I'm here. Where are you? - Hey, Bec. Look, I'm so sorry, but I'm not gonna make it. I'm actually at Mark's. There was a break-in in my house last night. - It's a whole thing. - Oh, my God. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Can you please just apologize to Gwyneth and reschedule our appointment for today? I'll call you later to fill in the details. - Okay, sure, but... - Thank you. Bye. - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's great. Thank you. This looks so good. Thank you. Bon appetit. - Good morning, Gwyneth. - Morning. - Where's Amelia? - I'm so sorry to tell you this. But... it's just me today. I hope that's okay. I-I have lots of ideas on how we can downsize that wine rack. Well, then, come on in. Liv took her own room as things got worse. She didn't wanna be this sick, needy thing all the time, so she said. So she started to retreat. Said it was for my sake. How could I get rid of any of it? After my dad died, my mom became a hoarder of his things, too. And anytime I work with a client who's suffered a loss, they can't imagine remembering that person without something to funnel it through. Our things feel like an extension of us, of those we love. But I'm telling you. And I know this is cliche, but we keep them here. I'm sorry. It's just that I... I feel like we could offend Liv's memory if we got too close like that. And you shouldn't have to suffer my grieving process. It's not fair, you don't have to be here for me like you are with your other clients. I want to be. Can I show you something? I wasn't entirely honest about how I knew Liv died. The funeral. She sent this to me before... Do you want some space? No, I don't want that. Not ever again. Mm... Tell me I'm not crazy. Is this a masterpiece? Uh, you're crazy. Oh. After last time, when I tried to give the paintings away, I thought, maybe I can do this. Thank you for your honesty. - Hm. - Do you want a drink? - Sure. Okay. - I could really use a drink. You know, this isn't about you not trying new things. I'm only saying you shouldn't try to be something you're not at the expense of who you really are. And your space should really reflect that. - Yeah. - I'd hang that version up. - That version? - Mm-hmm. It shows your struggle, your ambition and your acceptance. Ah. That's pretty, uh, that's pretty clever of you. - That's really good. - Thank you. So tell me about your writing. - My blog? - Yeah. You're, you're pretty, uh, you're prolific for a professional organizer. Oh. Well, I've always written. But the blog is all I've really ever put out there. - Well, what haven't you put out? - I have a manuscript. But it's very different than the blog. Oh, see, now that's something I would love to read. Please? - Really? Oh, you'd do that? - Yeah. You have a way with words. I'm sure it's something very special. Well, consider me equal parts grateful and terrified. Yeah. I feel the same way. Cheers to your writing and to the retirement of that putrid painting. That's great. Mm. So who are you outside of all this? You wear this, uh, veil of professionalism around you. Or is that in this, uh, this book you're writing? - Mm. - Wait. No spoilers. Uh, that's just me, I guess. No real personal life to speak of. Have you ever thought about dating one of your clients? Or would that be too chaotic? Was that too strong? Uh, that's not what I intended. Uh, I'm sorry it came out that way. No. Um, I mean, it was. But, uh, I'm sort of seeing someone. Oh, of course. Above board. I get it. He's a lucky guy. Oh, speaking of... - Would you mind? - Please. - Hey, Mark, what's up? - Hey, where are you? - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. I stepped out for a client meeting. - You were sleeping. - Oh, jeez. Thank God. I woke up terrified. Are you sure you're okay? - Uh, can I come get you? - No, I'm good, thank you. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I just, um... I can't breathe at the moment. I-I think I'm having a panic attack. Okay, just take a breath, sit down, have some water, I'll be back soon. Okay. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's good. Thanks. Uh... We can do this another day if you have to leave. - I do. Thank you. - Yeah, no problem. Hey. Are you feeling better? I just, I thought I lost you again. Of course not. I'm sorry, I guess I should've told you that I had a meeting. There's something I need to show you. Okay. Okay. Look here. I was able to track the IP address for the Chaos user. It pinged a couple of locations, an office building, your office building, an apartment complex and a yoga studio. Becca. No. - It can't be. - Your assistant? You said you guys are on the outs lately. That she's testing you? I mean, I guess I should have seen it. But, what, she's trying to scare me so that I bow out of my own company? I've seen it before, my clients, they gain a bit of notoriety and everybody wants a piece of them. It's not a safe life for somebody who feels indebted to everyone. And I love that about you, but you gotta be more careful. She must have been a part of the break-in, too. She was in your house. Probably looking for something to use against you. I need to talk to her about this. Okay, let's wait. You don't want things to get ugly. Strategize how to manage this, because she could be unstable. Yeah. Fine. Maybe you're right. But, hey, whatever you need, I'm here, okay? Morning. Okay, wait. Before you get upset... It went really well with Gwyneth. I mean, she's a bit clingy with me now, but the heat's off you. And I think it looked better for Squirrel that we didn't cancel last minute, you know what I mean? Wait. What are you even talking about? The session yesterday. I took it. Of course you did. Meels, it was only one session. And I can assure you, she's still your biggest fan. Stop talking, Becca. I'm not even talking about that. This is about you edging me out. - What? - I know you're Chaos, Becca. - Give it up. - What? You think I'm Chaos? Where the hell is this coming from? Your IP address, apparently. And I have the proof right here on my laptop. Show me. - I can't belie... - You don't have access... To anything in this office anymore. Pack your things. Please think about this for a second. Uh, I know we have our problems, but this is next level. I'm actually worried for you. Where did you get this so-called proof? Mark. Not only is he really good at security. But he tracked the IP address back to you. So you had Mark dig around on me? - Mm-hmm. - Amelia, he's lying. I'm not Chaos! I can't believe I actually have to say that. Please don't make this harder than it already is. If you leave now, I won't press charges, and I'll send you your final check. Three years, and this is what I get? Best be careful without me, Meels. No one left to catch your fall. I missed this. You feel the same, you know? Like comfort food. Good. And this is where we'll stay. Mm... If only. Where are you going? I've got to get some work done. I haven't touched the blog since I left the office. Okay, fine. But kiss me first. Morning. By the looks of it, weekends aren't a thing in your life. - Is it Saturday? - It's Sunday. Where did yesterday go? You didn't leave the study once. If I didn't bring you food, you would have starved. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. I'm just trying to get my bearings now that Becca's gone. I had a slew of angry reader comments to respond to after I missed my Monday Motivation blog post. Wow. I wish I had you like your followers do. I don't see them making you three meals a day. You're right. You spoil me good. Oh. Are you pouting right now? Don't tease, unless I get some time. Hm. Okay. Morning. - Morning. - What was that, on your screen? Oh, it's just... Uh, raccoon burglary. Trash cans were knocked over today. I didn't know you had cameras here. Of course I do. It's what I do. Well, I hope I didn't ruin the surprise. What surprise? I wasn't only working all weekend. I also made you this. It's all the notes she wrote you. I hope you don't mind I saw some of them. I'm sorry, I just, I didn't want her to get lost in all of this, especially since it's her letter that brought us back together after all these years... Amelia, this is incredible. - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. You've done enough for me already. You protected me against my better judgment, just like you did back then. And I promise, moving forward, that I will balance my work life better so I can be here with you more. - Really? - Yeah. I like the sound of that. Wow. So do you need anything from the store for this evening while I'm out? You're leaving today? I thought you had to finish your Monday piece. Finished it last night already. I have a client meeting today. I didn't tell you, but this publisher, my client, he wants to read my book. Hm. Isn't that exciting? You just said you were gonna stay here with me. I meant, last week I was super neglectful, but I promise not to do that again. This is a standing appointment with my client. I'm still gonna have a lot of those. I'll come back right after, promise. It's exciting though, right? I could be the next Marie Kondo. Amelia, I don't understand. After everything that's happened, you still wanna connect with even more people who'd try to take advantage of you? Take advantage of me? With my book? Yes. This Forrest guy, you don't even know him. How do you know you can trust him? How did you know his name is Forrest? You said it the last time you went to meet with him. Okay, but I don't see what the big deal is. He seems perfectly nice. And I'm sure he's gonna love the book. And I have all the faith that what you've written is gonna make an impact, but I need you to be prepared for all the possibilities. Why would you even think to worry? How did you meet this guy? Uh, Becca found him. She found him on the site. - He's a follower. - See? They could be working together, Amelia. We still don't know who broke in to your place. Do you really think Becca's dumb enough to do this on her own? This guy could be working with her. And now they wanna steal your book, publish it and take you for every penny you're worth. Mark, this is a bit out of line. Plus, I trust this guy. He, he feels like a friend. Is that all? Of course that's all. Seriously? If I'm gonna let myself fall for you again, I need to know you're not gonna be as reckless as you were with my heart as in college. You have to take your safety seriously. I do. Especially now, thanks to you. Really? Because I'm not so sure. Mark, I can't stop running my business on the off chance that someone might take advantage of me. I can't be suspicious of every single person on the planet. So I'm acting crazy then, I guess. Mark, I understand that you've seen a lot of suspicious things at your job. But I work with good people and their messy cabinets and drawers. I'm not in a dangerous line of work. I can't judge everyone based on Becca or Chaos. But, hey, if it's too much for you to have me here, I can go back to my place. I'll understand. Don't say that. Of course I want you here. The last thing I want is for you to go. I just need to know that this guy can be trusted is all. Okay. So how do we do that? How about this visit, you plant a camera in his house? We make sure he's not up to something, and then you can go back and re-collect it the next time. - No harm, no foul. - This feels extremely illegal. And so is stealing someone's book idea. But it, it happens all the time. And you have to admit... The potential Becca connection is here. It's just your life's work on the line, okay? - Hi. - Hey. Oh, here it is. The manuscript, how exciting. "By Amelia Sommers." You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Actually, can I use your restroom? Yeah, no problem. I just have to grab a few books, and I can meet you inside. Okay. Nice. Okay, I got the last... So what are we thinking? By title? By author? Is it weird if I wanna put them up at random? Just all over the place? Just the thought is giving me anxiety. Well, I like the idea that my eyes catch the book. Now if I have to find one, it just, you know, calls out to me. Forrest... You won't be able to find anything that way. The point is to make it functional. Well, if I ever have to find just one, then maybe I'd be forced to consider them all. And who knows, maybe I'd find something more interesting. - Oh, you have books. - A few. How do you, how do you sort 'em? By color. It's more of a look than a feel. I mean, it feels good, it feels... - Tidy. Huh. - Hm. I, uh, I want to say it means a lot, you know, that you're trusting me with your manuscript. I know how terrifying it must be, but I feel really honored that you're allowing me to, to read it. Thank you. Will you, uh, excuse me for a second? I have to get that. Don't. Amelia? Uh, I'm-I'm sorry. What, uh, what, what is that? I'm so sorry. I, uh... See, I'm in this stalker situation, and I had an intruder in my place. And you'll have to forgive me, but, um... I put this up. And then I realized immediately that it was very wrong. You, you were trying to record me? Yeah, but only as a precaution. I promised myself no bathrooms, no bedrooms, just as a way to... To see me coming and going? Oh, you, uh, you do this to all your clients? No. No, no, this isn't me. Not at all. I would never do this to anyone. But you, you did it. To me. Okay, why didn't you just tell me? Did I pressure you, you-you... You-you didn't have to... You didn't have to keep working here. Maybe... I know. I know. I'm so sorry, I... Look, this is just a huge misunderstanding. Can we please just forget it and get back to work? I-I think I'd, I think I'd like you to actually leave. I'm so sorry. I think I should go home for a bit. So you're running away again. I'm sure you saw what happened. It's too much. I'm a mess. You don't need to deal with me anymore. What if I wanna deal with you? Amelia, this isn't one-sided. I'm not a client or a follower. Uh, I don't want a relationship that's wrapped in a tiny little bow. That's what ruined us before. But we have to be together on this. Same page. Come here. It's gonna be okay. So from now on, all comments will route to me, and I'll make sure to weed out all the creeps. What? It's what Becca always wanted. She wanted to control you. I wanna help you. Where did I put that box cutter? Are you sure you're comfortable with this? People aren't their things, right? It's time to start over, just like Liv wanted. - You good? Okay. - Yeah. Thank you. All right. Now food. - Okay. - All right. Divorce papers? Hey, come sit! Food's ready! Actually, I'm not feeling so great. Like, maybe I should just lay down for a bit. - You okay? What's wrong? - Yeah, I... Um, it's just been an overwhelming few days. Well, you know what can help with that? Pancakes. - Come eat. - I'm good. Really. Thank you. Maybe later? - Something wrong? - No. No. I just, I hit a wall, that's all. Hm. Well, why don't you go lay down? Uh, if I'm sick, I don't wanna give it to you. May I just lay down in here... if that's okay? Wow. You sound exactly like Liv. Uh... Uh, speaking of, I found this jewelry box. It is hers, and I thought, I remember her sister saying at the memorial that she wanted some of Liv's things. Maybe I could bring this to her on my way to work tomorrow? That's sweet, but I can run it over to Vicki's next week myself. You're so thoughtful, Meels. That's what Becca used to call me. Oh. Well, now it can be our thing. Oh, and... maybe Vicki'll want this, too. - Get some rest. - Hm. - How you feeling? - Much better, thanks. I was thinking, since you've been so overwhelmed, we get out of town for a few days. I know the perfect place. I'd like that. Amelia, wait! Hey, it's Becca. Leave a message if you must. Thanks. Hi, Becca. I really messed up. I don't even know how to begin to apologize, but I'm in some sort of trouble with Mark. I didn't know who else to call. I'm on my way over to Liv's sister's house right now. Can you please just call me back ASAP? - Hi. Can I help you? - Vicki. Hi. - Do you remember me? - Should I? We met at your sister's funeral. I really need to talk to you about Mark and Liv. Come on in. Forgive the mess of boxes. I'm moving early next week. - Moving? - I only came to be close to Liv. I work from home. Thought it'd be nice to escape the city for a while. Had no idea what kinda hell it'd be. - When did you all move here? - Mm... Maybe two years ago they did? I only came a few months after. And why did they move, if you don't mind me asking? Liv said change of scenery. But, to me, it was just another tactic Mark used to take Liv further away. Now, what do you have to do with Mark? I want nothing to do with him. I found Liv's divorce paperwork and a letter from you about getting away. But everything Mark has said about their marriage, everything I've seen makes it seem like they were so in love. - Why? - They were in love. Even I have to admit that. Mark came into Liv's life like some knight in shining armor. Before Mark, Liv was being watched. Someone even broke into her house. Liv thought someone was out to get her and Mark came into the picture and made her feel safe. And magically, all the creepy stuff stopped. They got married fast, things seemed great. She was this free-spirited, self-made woman, you know? And then all of a sudden she started letting Mark keep all these tabs on her. Wouldn't go anywhere without her. We stopped knowing Liv as Liv. She became Liv as Mark and then just kinda someone else. She wouldn't answer my calls, she stopped coming around. Then she quit her job at the school, and the only way she'd talk to me was over text. So finally I showed up and confronted her, and Mark stepped in and told me that I was being jealous and didn't have her best interests at heart, which is insane. I was so happy she'd found someone. I knew in my heart after some time had passed that he wasn't the right one. But that didn't stop me from trying. And then all of a sudden she started to get sick. Real sick. And things changed again. She got a letter to me apologizing for what had happened between us. I had a courier sneak one out to her when Mark was out getting groceries, days before she was just... gone. I think she knew the end was near. Didn't want it to be with Mark. But by then I was, it was too late. What did she die of, if you don't mind? Um, a stroke, from diabetes. She'd had it since she was a kid and she managed it well. It wasn't until she got with Mark that things took a dive. In her letter, she said she had a terminal illness. That's ridiculous. What letter? Um... She sent that to me before she died, basically telling me to get back together with Mark. That's why this is so confusing. What? This is the letter Liv gave to me before she died. Look at the handwriting. Ah. Ah... I don't understand. I've seen all of these notes that Liv wrote to Mark, and they all look like this one here. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I spent hours looking at them. I made him a collage. And what about Mark? Do you recall what his handwriting looks like? When Liv wanted out, he took her. I know he did. And I will spend the rest of my life trying to prove it. You should be careful with him. If not, he might do the same thing to you. Becca. Hi. Thank God. Can you meet me at Squirrel in an hour? Hello? Nice conversation with my future wife? Come on, Bec, where are you? Hey! What are you doing here all alone, outside the office someone used to be stalking you from? I, um... Uh, I'm-I'm meeting Becca here. She'll be here any minute, we're gonna talk... You and I both know that that cannot happen. She cannot be trusted. You know what? I think now's the perfect time for us to go on our retreat. Our retreat? Get out of town, like we decided. Somewhere no one can find us. But we didn't bring our things. It's like you said. All you need is this. Okay, just let me text Becca and tell her... No. Absolutely not. She does not deserve your time or your attention. We both know that. You're gonna love this place. Mm... I was gonna wake you, but you looked so peaceful. I'm starving, though. You hungry? Oh. I left you some clean clothes at the foot of the bed. - Forrest? - Hi. What are you doing here? Amelia left this at my place. I wanted to return it. You haven't heard from her, have you? She was supposed to meet me here last night, and she didn't show up, and now she's not answering my calls and I'm totally freaking out. Uh, I-I haven't seen her. Not since she tried to plant a camera in my house, anyway. Wait, hold up! Wait, what's-what's-what's wrong? What happened? She's in trouble, I just know it. - What kind of trouble? - It's this guy she's dating. He's put all kinds of things in her head. She called me panicking last night because she found some pretty dark stuff. And now she's gone and I don't know what to do. I mean, do you think we should just call the police? Well, uh, if you can't figure out where she is, yeah. Wait! Ah. I have a tracker on my phone in case I need to get to one of our joint clients. - She's way the hell out there. - Oh? Is that her? I've gotta go. I've gotta go get her. Uh, w-wait, wait a second. Um, uh, I'll go with you. - I just have to get one thing. - Okay. Okay. What? You're not hungry? I want out, Mark. I want to leave. I don't wanna be with you anymore. Fine. But let me say something. Liv tried to leave me on her own terms. I think you know that. But in the end, she was weak, and she came back. Was she weak because of what you did to her? Did you poison her? Her body? Her mind? - A bit of both? - I don't like that question. Makes me feel like you've already made your mind up about me. But I can be good to you, Amelia. I have been good to you. You say I protect you. But if I'm no longer here, who's gonna protect you then? Who do you protect me from? You? From yourself, more like it. I simply pointed out your weaknesses, and you didn't like it. You took everything from me. Well, let's not give me all the credit for that. You wouldn't be here if you didn't have it in you. You made every decision. Don't put that on me. You wanna talk about blame? How about the fact that you lied to me? You left me stranded and clueless and heartbroken. You made me this way. And, honestly, Liv might still be alive if it wasn't for you. Vicki, too. How selfish you are. I was so afraid of being hurt like that again, I couldn't let it happen. I won't let it happen. You killed Vicki, too. You won't get away with this. Well, I did it with your box cutter. And you were the only one someone might have seen there, as far as I'm concerned. So think about it. I'm still protecting you, the only one who can and the only one who will. So will I let you leave? Go ahead. Sure. But the moment you step out that cabin door, no one is going to protect you, and I'm gonna come for you. And that's something you're gonna have to live with for the rest of your life. Because you can't go to the police, you'll go to jail. So you can't do that. But you can leave. Or you can stay. You can stay and feel protected and safe knowing I'm the only one who can hurt you, but I'm choosing not to so long as you choose not to hurt me. Sounds like a pretty easy decision. You know, you asked for this. I could use this on your wrists. Make it look like a murder suicide. Are you ready to come back yet? Do you like how this feels? The chaos? Is this the right place? The pin was all over the place all day today. Yeah, I-I think this is it. But it hasn't moved for a while now. Where have they gone? I suddenly feel less confident. Seems like they're just here. More visitors. What a surprise. Where is she? Hey, hey. All right, put the knife down. - What'd you do to her? - Put the, put the knife down. You're asking the wrong question. How about what did she do to all of us? I mean, come on, let's be honest. Meels can be quite manipulative. - No? - You turned her against us. She had it in her to turn against you. It was easy. What does that say? And now look at us. Abandoned yet again, leaving the two of you in danger while she gets away. I wish I didn't have to keep teaching her these lessons. - I really do. - Put the knife down! Hey, hey, put the knife down! What the hell are you doing here? What... What are you, what are you talking about? So you two were working together. I should have known you were right, Mark. I'm so sorry. You were protecting me. How did you know where to find me, anyway? Your tracker on your phone. You left my phone on? Jeez, Mark. I didn't realize. Why can't you let it go, Bec? Because... Because you were too good to be true. And now you're with him? Hey, after all we've done? What, now we're not good enough? Yeah. What he said. You're both pathetic. - Hey, hey, hey! - You were right, Mark. You're right. I am safe with you. There is no other choice. Someone has to go. I'll remember those words for a very long time. You know, for such a seemingly good boyfriend, your love letters suck. You could have at least tried to make it look like Liv's handwriting. You got me again, Meels. But this is the last time I fall for you. Run. Run! Go, go, go, go, go! Where do you think you're going, Amelia? Hit him again! - Hit him! - Hit him! It's okay. It's over. For all these years I've been promoting the idea that tidy makes meaning. But I've been wrong. Trying to keep a space organized when the space or the things in the space mean nothing to you is a setup for failure, no matter how many organizing hacks you try. I challenge each of you to take a good look around and determine what in your space is really there for you. Forget tidy, if something is better for you, scattered across your floor, then do that, if it's true to you. And, no, this is not an excuse to be lazy. This is a call to action, to shake things up, to help you find your own meaningful tidiness in an effort to really be in your space. Because as I now admit, meaning makes tidy. And on that note... My book is now available on shelves and online. I just want to say thank you to each of you for being there and sticking with me. See you soon. - Hey. - Hi. When you said lunch, I thought you meant at the office. I'm actually taking the week off. Did I, uh, just lock lips with a stranger? Um, oh, uh, I'm-I'm sorry, I must, I must have the wrong address. Whoa. I apologize, um, I'm-I'm supposed to meet my workaholic girlfriend who, uh, you-you alarmingly look similar to, uh-huh. Ha-ha. - Do you know an Amelia Sommers? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, you do? - I do. So is Squirrel about to implode as we speak? No, Becca's there, she's got everything under control now that she's my partner. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is, uh... This is cause for celebration, right? Mm-mm, you better eat quick because I've got a massage at 2:00. Okay, you, you know what, you are, like, blowing my mind right now, all week. Better get used to it. I got you one, too. You did? Nice! How thoughtful. Thank you. I am taking you with me all the way, with some much needed space and independence, of course. - Um, of course, all the way. - Yeah. All the way. Well, does that mean that I have to clutter my life again to get you back again? Nah. I think I clutter your life enough as it is. Okay. Well, let's cheers to that. To not not cluttering anyone's life. - Not cluttering. - Cheers. Good. Yeah.
