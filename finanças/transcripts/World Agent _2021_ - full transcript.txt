One land certificate under the name Soleh Bin Burhanudin. Please check. - What took you so long? - This is the fastest you can get. If you want it faster, then get it from the President himself. So what's it going to cost me? Three hundred thousand. - Here you go. - Thank you. Next is... Mrs. Retno. So, can you help with my divorce papers? That would be 1 million rupiah. That's too expensive! I have a special offer today. It's buy one, get one free. Go and find another divorce case. If you can't, then it's 1 million for one. - Mrs. Lulu. Come here! - Mrs. Retno? What is it? Are you following through with your divorce? - It's too much of a hassle! - No, it's easy. Mr. Jamal here can help us. How much is it? Only one million for two! I'm in! Payment must be settled by today. Well, I also take credit card. Here, you can use my husband's card. - Let my husband pay for our divorce. - Serves him right. Hey, Jamal! Can you help me get a wife? I just took care of a divorce, and you want to get married? Send me your video profile and add some flowery words. What kind of words? Think for yourself. Better come and sit inside. What took you so long? Sorry. I was making rounds. Door to door. Let me open the office first. Number one, please. That's me! What do you want? I want to sell my car. Where's the certificate? You just bought this recently? - Yeah, that car. - Why are you selling it? I can't afford to pay the tax. I agree. Now everything is taxed. Yeah, I could use the money for my family. That's more like it. I hope they won't put tax on my family, too. Alright, give it to me. I'm taking this and will let you know when I have a match. I mean a buyer. - Okay, I need it fast. - Sure. Okay, next! Is my request done, luv? Your ID? - Here you go. - Here's the fee. Thank you, luv. Another one? Next! How's my thesis? Under the name Reza Lesmana. Thesis? Wait... Oh no. The deadline is tomorrow morning. This is about life and death! Not just about graduating. My girlfriend would leave me! Where is it? Ah, there it is! It's done. You just have to add a closing statement. But you said I don't have to do anything. Students nowadays can't even come up with a closing statement. No wonder a lot of you are still unemployed. But it's your word. Fine. Just a closing statement? I can take you anywhere. Just tell me. Sorry, I'm waiting for a bajaj. Hey! Bajaj! There, it's done. Thanks, Jamal. Look at how much I made this morning. You see this? This is a fortune! It's not even morning anymore. Those people were waiting for you. You should thank me for letting them sit here, or they would've left. You're sneaky. Just tell me you want your cut. Here. There's nothing I can't do in this world. Selling cars, making ID, finding you a soulmate, anything. Every little things in this world can be done. Of course, for the right price. Now you're talking. Want a bowl of noodles? Make me one. Your best. Alright. Just relax. I told you, tomorrow or the day after. I will send you the design. Alright. Thanks, man. You're working too much and neglecting your thesis. You choose agricultural majors, but work as a graphic designer. I don't want you to delay your thesis any longer. We have plans for the future. Why are you smirking? Have you finished it? It's done. I just had it printed. No way. I'm not lying. I just printed them this afternoon. - Why didn't you tell me? - I just told you. You would never tell me if I didn't ask. When are you going to present it? Next month. Just relax. I won't let you down. And I will fight and give my all for you. It's Roni again. I have to pick it up. - Roni, or Rini? - Roni. - Roni, or Rini? - It's Roni. - Roni, or Rini? - Roni. - Rini or Roni? - Rini! See? Who is Rini? Your second girlfriend? Stop trying to trick me. This is my regular customer. I won't be long. Fine. But you better not lie to me. Hello, Ron? Just wait for it. If you still need some changes, I can do it for you. Okay. Alright. Tomorrow or the day after. Okay. Wait, why did it become spicy now? You can finish that. I'm full. 2 Years Later Really miss you, Mom and Dad. We miss you, too. How's Pontianak? - Great as ever? - Great? How's your job? Everything's okay? It's all "lancar jaya". Lancar Jaya? Isn't that a bus? You still know how to make jokes. That means everything is well and good. - I thought you work as a bus driver now. - Come on. Where are you? Sorry, their flight was delayed. We'll be there in around 10 minutes. So you're asking me to wait another 10 minutes? Not exactly 10 minutes. It may be 7, or less. Just wait. Fine, but hurry. Where are they? I don't know. He said he'll be here in 10 minutes, but he got caught in traffic. It's fine. Let's just wait. Where did you know Reza, Citra? He's my neighbor, we live in the same block. I thought you two met at work. No, I work in a bank. Reza is a graphic designer. Okay, enough. So when will he be here? How long is he going to make us wait? First, the wait in Palembang, now, we're waiting in Jakarta. - I'm already starving. - Just be patient. I can't fix my hunger by being patient. Only this warm rice can fix it. I got stuck in traffic. You lied to me! You said you're not in traffic. That was then, this is now. I don't care. Geez. - Is that Citra? - Yes, Dad. We're eating here? Her parents are inside. Welcome. Oh gosh! - You're so gandeng (hold)! - Gandeng Sir? Yes, you are. What are you doing? You told me to gandeng. "Gandeng" in Sundandese means noisy. He's not asking you to hold him. Please. Can I get you a drink? Cold mineral water, please. Thanks a lot. Give him a bottle of mineral water. Can you handle the shop for me? I have to go get my wok. Sure. - Here you go. - Thanks. What year is that? I think around 70s. Actually, I inherit that Pesva from my dad. Vespa. That's right. Pesva. With "V". I know. With V. Whatever you say, Bro. By the way, how long you've been working for Masto? It's been two years. Very long time no see, two years! What's your previous job? World Agent. I can help take care of everything. Anything you want, I can get it. Fantastic... World Agent? Excellent! But now I just work here. The world keeps changing. Everything can be done online. For every small matters, people just have to search them with Mr. Google. Everything is online. Mr. Google is your relative? That's a website. Oh, you mean that wi-fi thing? That's called googling. But no problem, that makes sense. At least it's an honest work. You're right. It's not much, but it's honest work. My name is Jamal. In Arabic, that means handsome. Perfect fit for me. I'm Farid F.F.F bin F.A. Farid Faturrahman Firdaus Fadilmunawan bin Fadli Arifin. Full fantastic, yes? Full fantastic. Don't worry about the wedding reception, we've prepared the budget for that. Actually, us too, auntie. You don't have to call me auntie. You can call me Ambu. We're about to be in-laws. Okay, Ambu. Hey, does she stink...? Why should we call her mambu (stinky)? Ambu, not mambu. They are Sundanese. She's right. We're not asking for your help. We have prepared the funds ourselves. That's great then! Let's just pick the date. Right? We can talk later. Now it's time to eat. We prepared these for you. Javanese cuisine. Full set of gudeg. - Thank you... - Wait. Before we start... ...I have some questions to ask. Are you from Palembang, or from Java? We are Javanese, we just happen to live there. My mother is from Solo, my father is from Semarang. And my husband's parents are both from Jogja. His full name is Baskoro Rajasa Kusumaningrat. - Yes, he has the blood. - The blood? Yes, we're of noble descent. My great grandfather's nephew is a relative of a Wedana in Bantul. He rules all over the Southern Coast. Wow, nobleman? Like Raden? Then we're going to be a perfect match. Our great grandfather is a descendant of a Menak in Garut. Merak (peacock)? A bird? Not a bird. "Menak" is a nobleman in Sundanese terms. My name is Tatang Engkus Lesmana. Tatang is a noble's name. My grandmother is a distant relative of Suryakencana's regent. Suryakencana's regent? Where's the regency? That's not important. What's important is that we know that we're all nobles, right? I don't like where this is going. What do you mean? They're Javanese and we're Sundanese. There's no way we can be in-laws. This is pointless. I knew it! They must be Sundanese! So what? We can't let Citra marry Reza. What should we do then? Reza. You are my only son, the one who will continue our name. If you marry a Javanese, you'll cut our bloodlines. - You can't marry a Javanese. - Who made the rules? I never know about that rule. See? You won't even listen to your parents. I said I don't want you to marry a Javanese! Jamal, wait a minute. When are you going to pay the rent? I was just about to come to your house. So you have the money now? Here's the thing. My sister just wired me the money from Medan. But there's a problem with the ATM and somehow it got stuck. So she can only wired me half of it. So I can only pay half for now. So, that dress looks new. It matches that new floral hairpin. Really? And that blue flip-flops? They're gorgeous with the sunflowers. It's like enjoying a cup of coffee with just the perfect amount of sugar. Just like you. Okay. Half is good enough then. But if you need some money to buy that perfect coffee... You can even take half of this. My body stinks. I'm not confident standing here with you. Jamal! See you later. I just don't want to have a Javanese for in-laws. Think about Reza and Citra. They've been together for years. They have to break-up and forget about everything. Love requires sacrifice. I know. But not their relationship. Even my great grandfather sacrificed his own life! My great grandfather died at war in the 14th century. He'd be turning on his grave if we have Sundanese for in-laws. I understand about that. But how about Citra? They have to break-up! You can't do that! What if Citra got branded as an old maid? This sacrifice needs to be made. My ancestors fought to the death to protect their pride! We can't let our pride be crushed by Javanese! It's like in the Pajajaran era! What do you mean? Where's our pride as a Javanese? I can't stand how Citra is now just agreeing to whatever he says. Imagine if they're married. He would treat Citra like a doormat! You should talk to your parents about this. Your parents started this. My parents? Your parents, too. You blamed them first. - But your parents... - Your parents... - But I mean... - What? Fine. Forget about them. This is about us. - What should we do about it? - Whatever. This is our relationship. What are we going to do about this? - Whatever. - I'm serious. I need your help. You're the man. You think about it. Selfish. What did you say? It's raining. No? What so good about this guy? You were young once too. They love each other. What can we do? Love grows after they get married. Not before that! Are you okay? My head hurts listening you yelling all day long! You should've told me earlier that your parents are so traditional. You should've told me that your parents are so traditional, too. Can't you tell from my face? I'm a real Javanese. Really? My ex has a Javanese face, but she's from Manado. Your ex? Which one? So you're comparing me to one of your exes. Not like that. Who's prettier? Me or her? - Of course it's you. - Liar. Tell me the truth! - You're prettier. - Liar! I'm telling the truth! You're prettier! Liar! You just blinked, that means you're lying. Fine. She is prettier. Look, I won't blink, even for a year. See? She's prettier than me... You used to tell me I'm the prettiest girl in the world. So who's prettier now, me or her? You're prettier, okay? Enough of this. You always twist my words. What do you want? Whatever. Whatever? Fine. My ex is not that pretty, and so are you. But both of you care about me. You're comparing me again? - Not like that. - Then what? I don't know. My head hurts. You're always like that, avoiding problems. Who's avoiding? Then what are you doing now if not avoiding, huh? Why are you quiet? What should I say? Anything I said is wrong to you. - Fine, then don't speak. - Alright, fine. Whatever. Hello? I will buy that 3,000 square meters land. Yeah. What was that? What, 15 storeys building? Sure, I'll buy it too. Maybe I can stretch it up to 30 storeys high. Sure, alright. - Hello? - Where are you? I was just getting my phone from the car. What is it? Your coffee is getting cold. Okay, I'm coming in. Why don't you buy the 1x2 meters land? Babe... ...please. Please. Baby. Move. Please, don't be mad. We shouldn't be fighting like this. We have bigger problems. Okay? You promised me you will fight for me. You will fight for our relationship and give your all. What, I never promised that. Yes, you did! Don't worry. I won't disappoint you. And I will give my all for you. You said that! I know, but I never said I promise. So that's how it is? I don't care how you do it, but you have to fix this! If you can't, maybe we're not meant for each other. Figure it out yourself! But don't you dare delay this like with your thesis. Again with the thesis. Sir, do you know what time the boxed bajaj will usually came? Boxed bajaj? Oh, you mean Jamal's. He sold it already. He retired as a World Agent. Right, the World Agent. Where is he now? He's helping me with my shop now. He's out to make a delivery. You can wait here while enjoying some noodle. Okay, make me a bowl of yamin noodle. Sure, sit down, please. You know Jamal, too? Yeah, he helped me once. Where are you working? I work freelance. As a graphic designer. Really? I am a freelancer, too! I usually work as a staff for events and live musics. - Staff for events and live musics. - Yeah. No wonder your English is impressive. - You meet foreign artists often? - That's right! Right. Do you have a name card? - Business card? - Yeah. Maybe my boss wants to make foster or billboard design. - It's poster. - Yeah, foster. Here you go. There he is. How are you, Jamal? I'm good. You still remember me? Reza Lesmana? Who asked for your help with my thesis. This is about life and death! This is not just about graduating, but... My girl would leave me! I remember you. How are you and your girlfriend? I guess you're married now. That's the thing. You're a World Agent, able to solve any problem. I'm not a World Agent anymore. This modern day doesn't need people like me anymore. But I think you're the only person who can help me. You're a good talker, has lots of ideas, and a good negotiator. My parents and hers are not in the same page as us. I need someone to convince them. And you're the right person for this. I said I'm not a World Agent anymore. Everything moves instantly, in this modern day. It's no use. Here's my card. You can call me. Maybe you'll change your mind. Such a hard-worker. Fantastic! You helped me with my girl once. I'm sure you can help me again so I can marry her. I'm not a World Agent. I quit. Sorry, but I can't help you. Trust Jamal. He'll take care of everything. Smooth sailing, guaranteed. Looking for your soulmate? Then look for World gent Jamal. He's the best! He helped me sell my car! I can use the money to marry again. He helped me make my ID, that handsome World Agent, Jamal. I'll be getting married soon. Every problems can be solved... ...by Jamal, World Agent. I was born into this world... ...to help people in need. You go inside, I need to make a call. Paijo! Don't forget to feed my 100 Australian cows. And don't be late! They will get sick if you do. And my 300 lambs, don't forget to trim them. Those furs will be exported to the US. Honey, that phone is dead, I have to charge that. Use this one. Why don't you export all Javanese instead? Where are we going? I can't leave work for too long. Relax, we're seeing a World Agent. He will solve our parents' problem. World Agent? What is that? You never told me about it. I am telling you now. This World Agent can help you to solve any problem. He has lots of ideas. He even helped me with my thesis. So you got him to do your thesis? Not like that. Jamal only did some parts, but I did all the work. Jamal or Jamila? - Jamal is a man. - Liar. Jamal or Jamila? I'm tired of this. I'm already stressed out because of our parents. If you lie, I will leave. Why should I lie to you? You can see him for yourself. Oh, so I should see him alone, not with you? Of course with me. Then why didn't you say so? You're frustrating me. Who's the real frustrating one here? - What did you say? - It's complicated. My job is to solve problems, without any problems. You're a government pawnshop employee? No, I'm not. What then? You can say I'm like a compost machine. Every trash you bring to me, I will turn them into compost. So it can benefit other people, especially me. What do you mean? The World Agent is back. - So you can help us. - Let's talk. The problems with your parents is an easy thing to solve. It's all about how you're handling it. I have helped in 7,000 cases... ...and you're the 7,001. You've succeeded in all those 7,000 cases? Don't ask me that. So you succeed? Don't force me to brag about it. Bragging is the devil's work. I am a World Agent. The Devil is a Hell Agent. So what should we do? Before we discuss on what we should do, you two have to believe in me. Because the thing that we're going to do will be based on lies. But it will have a positive impact for both of you. And will be explained after the situation is clear. So you mean we have to lie to our parents? You two want to marry, right? Then trust Jamal, the World Agent. Whatever. You're always say that. Okay, let's do it. Two stripes means positive... ...one stripe means negative. Put the lid back when you're done. Don't let it get wet. - Name? - Ncun. - Pardon me? - Ncun. - Here you go. - Thanks. Mpok, what are you doing here? Are you even married? I'm not married yet. But if you want to marry me, I swear I will accept. It's not like that, it's just that this is... ...a pregnancy test. Here's the thing, I went swimming yesterday... ...and they say a woman can get pregnant in a swimming pool. And I went to a public pool. That's not true. If you swim in a public pool... ...who's going to take responsibility? There's a whole platoon in that pool. And if you swim in the sea, your husband might be a dolphin. You two are just making fun of me. This is because you trust that Jamal too much. We still don't have anything now. Just relax, maybe those women are busy cooking at home. You mean I'm impatient? - Not like that. - Liar. - Why should I lie about this? This is all a lie. You want me to lie. You want me to claim pregnancy with other people's test. We're still trying to figure this out. We will tell our parents the truth when the time is right. Oh my God! - Where's Citra? - I don't know. Baby! What are you doing here? I'm looking for Jamal. Baby! Why are you shouting? Jamal! - You want to see something? - What is it? See, it's positive. But I did not give you this. This is not mine. This is from my niece, Ncun, the one in yellow-ish dress. Ncun? Ncun, yes. You're right. Where is she? That's the thing. She has to go to Bandung and had to chase the travel bus. She asked me to give this to you. You are the best. The goods doesn't come with free service. Fine, how much of this "service" that you want? That's insulting. Listen, I have a lot of money. I don't need more. I just want him to buy me lunch. That's easy. I will treat you to the best chicken noodle in Jakarta. Mie Ayam Masto. Just for two. That's great. Let's go. Jamal. Should I wear the cute hairpin on our date? You know, to get you fired up? Yeah... See you! I seek Allah's forgiveness. You give this to your parents. Why me? You're the one who agreed to lie. But you agreed too. Did I say I agree? Well, no. But you said whatever. That means you agreed. You said whatever. - You do it. - No, you. - No, you do it. - But they're your parents! Don't worry, I still have backup plan. But this time it's more verbal. What do you mean by verbal? You should tell your parents directly. That's what we're trying to avoid. I think we can't do it. You just have to memorize it. Basically, both are similar, but with different endings. Don't get it mixed-up. When you meet your parents... ...wear something matching. So you two will look like a perfect couple. Right? And remember your facial expression. You have to be convincing. Pour your feelings into words. Let's say you're talking to your Dad about love. Let me show you. In this occasion... ...I'm begging you... ...to listen to my story... You can cry like that. I'm an actor. Almost there. Let me tell you about... ...my never ending love. - Never ending? - Indeed. - He can cry! - You have to cry! A huge sin! Don't overreact. Do it better. - Did I do it wrong? - Yes, you did. Now your turn. A... ...huge... ...sin! Not quite there yet. Still lacking feelings. I told you, pour your feelings into words. Why can't you do it right? A... ...huge sin! See, it's natural. Don't stammer. If you're natural, your feelings will come out. Okay? In this occasion... ...I'm begging you to hear... ...my never ending love story for Reza. If our love was like riding a motorbike, a police officer will surely fine us. Why? Because there'll be us 3: me, Citra, and love. Everyone must have fallen in love... My love for Reza was never a choice... ...but a necessity. What is wrong with you? Please forgive me. I have committed a huge sin. I have made the biggest mistake. A... ...huge sin! Just tell me what happened. What did you do? I'm sorry. I've tarnished our family name. What are you talking about? What did you do? What is it? Why are you crying? I made Reza pregnant. I'm pregnant! Girl, you're not funny at all! Your acting sucks! Oh my God. Are you insane? You're a man. You can't get pregnant. You said you're going to buy me lunch and we'll be eating, just us two. I'm buying you lunch, right? Yeah, but I want to eat with you. You promised me. Sure thing! I will treat you to the best chicken noodle in Jakarta. Mie Ayam Masto. Just for two. Sure, I'll treat you lunch, but your lunch for two is with Farid here. Farid is looking for a place. I know you have a lot of place for rent, Mpok Sani. Talk to him. Maybe he'll find a place that suits him. Or maybe something else. Don't worry, Mpok. I tested negative for COVID-19. Just got tested yesterday. You're so cute! I want to pinch you. I'm looking for the spoon. It's wet. Perfect. See you later. What should we do now? We have failed. Yeah, and it's our fault. This is just the first phase, we still have a long way to go. There will be the second phase. - How many phases? - A lot. Just don't give up. There are a lot of challenges in life. If there are lots of dirty clothes, then it's a laundry. Our soldiers never gave up fighting for Indonesia's freedom. So we have to declare war with our parents? That's not what I meant. Just never give up and don't be suicidal. Then what now? Suicide. Yes, suicide. No, this is insane. Just pretend. - How should we do it? - Come on. This is the ultimate trick. You two will go on top of a building. I will gather my friends. We will record that and it will become viral. And your parents will see that and accept your relationship. How does that sound? Is there any other options? We can copy the most phenomenal couple. Let's do it in Romeo and Juliet style. Here's the plan. Use a lot of toothpaste and brush your teeth. Do it slowly. Make sure you get a lot of foams coming from your mouth. And act like you got poisoned. Stay focused with your act. Keep focusing. We'll see how your parents react. Stay focused with your act. I said focus! We can't lie to them like that. We're not going to do that. Our parents will get a heart attack. So what now? I guess I'll have to make an approach. What do you mean? I mean, the problem is clear. Different ethnics. One is Javanese, and one is Sundanese. I admit... ...this issue needs a not so easy solution. I will pay no matter how much. As long as we can get married. That's right. What's our next plan? I... I need more information about your parents. For what? Since the difference is clear... Why don't we look for something they have in common? How? Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I help you? Who is that? You're new here? No, this is my son's home. - You're Reza's father. - I'm right here. I can't see. You want money, don't you? I'm a masseur. Reza often ask for my service. But he's not here. So coming here was a mistake? I came all the way here. I can't go home now, it's already dark. It's still noon. - I'm blind, remember? - Right. I can only see night time. Okay... ...I can go back on my own. Wait. What if you give me a massage? I think I need one. - Sure... - Come in. Take a seat. - Will he pull it off? - He should. We paid him a lot of money for this. - That hurts! - Wait, bear with it... Be careful with that. There's nothing wrong with my leg. Bear with it! It's gone now. - You want another one? - No, that's enough. - Enough? - That's enough. You... Wait! - Are you a masseur? - Yes, I am. Can you come to my place? My body is aching all over. Here's my place. This is everything I could gather when I disguised myself earlier. Here they are. Some may look obvious, like their ID. We are looking for what they like, and don't like. Mr. Baskoro likes Campursari. Mr. Tatang likes Gambus. This doesn't match. So let me scratch this one. Mr. Baskoro likes horror movies, and Mr. Tatang likes action. See? They have nothing in common. But don't give up hope yet. We won our freedom by not giving up. It's no use. Nothing matches. I know my Dad very well. You two are seeking for your parents' blessings, right? Just trust me, the World Agent. Let's just go home. Should I give you a refund? Just keep it, it's yours. We give up. What do they have in common? It's really hard. I found it! World Agent Jamal Pick it up. Your friend, the World Agent, is calling. My friend? He is. You trust him 1,000 percent. But you agreed for him to help us. Did I say I agree? I just said whatever. Where have you been? Stop thinking about her. Me and your Mom need to go back to our hometown, you should come. I will introduce you to Mr. Acep Surecep's daughter, okay? Answer me. That's enough. Stop picking on him. Let him rest. Where's the key? Let's go. Dear. Kids these days are different, we can't force our wishes on them. Preserving our cultural traditions should be enforced. But this is not preserving tradition, you're just making enemies. I've made my point, I won't allow it. Another word for "give up"? Did you see Citra's face? She looks devastated. What if she's thinking of doing of something horrible? "8 letters down. Giving up due to running out of ideas." Are you listening to me? - I am listening. - Liar! Why should I lie to you? Fine, what do you want to say? Whatever! Whatever? "Whatever"! "Giving up due to running out of ideas." Whatever! Please enjoy. Cilok Stand Javanese Style Sundanese food turned Javanese? Culture thief. Let's go home. Just a minute, I haven't got mine. - Where are you going? - Waiting in the car. Okay, I will be with you soon. Abah? Are you okay? So this is it? There's no point to keep going. Our parents will never agree. Before we separate for good... ...can I ask you something? What do you think that makes us a match? You're the only woman... ...who can make me listen to your nagging without making me hate you. I always listen to your nagging. Even though I don't like to be nagged. How about you? What do you think that makes us a match? You're forgetful... ...careless... ...indisciplined... You need me to nag at you and I feel comfortable doing it. Honestly... ...I enjoyed every single moment when I nagged at you. I can never imagine if you don't have me to nag. You're going to forget about lots of things. Your life would be a mess if no one is there to nag at you. I know that, my life will be a mess. I hope... ...you can find a woman... ...who can nag at you without hurting your feelings. Me, too. I hope you found a man who is even more careless than me. See? Your ex already knows that we're breaking up. It's probably just Roni, who wants to order my design. - Roni or Rini? - Roni. - Roni or Rini? - Roni. - Roni or Roni? - Rini. See? I knew it was Rini! Mom? Hello. What happened to Dad? Reza! Wait! What is it? I finally found something in common between both of your fathers! We can talk later. I have something more important. - Come on, go! - Wait, open the door! I found it! Reza! Reza! What happened, Mom? Your Dad ulcer flared up, he's having a surgery now. Excuse me, Ma'am. The patient lost a lot of blood. Is there anyone in the family with B negative blood type? There is one. No! Not me! It won't hurt, Sir. Just a like a small bite from an ant. Ants don't suck blood! No, no, no! I have the perfect Campursari for you. Let me put it on for you. Not that! Now! Abah, let's meet Citra's family after this, okay? No. Abah, we should thank them. I said no. Don't force me. What did they ever do to you to make you hate them this much? It's not their fault, but their ancestors'. So what did they do wrong? Listen, this is a true story from my grandfather. A long time ago... ...King Hayam Wuruk from Java... ...wanted to marry Princess Diah Pitaloka from Tatar Sunda, Pajajaran Kingdom. It turned out... ...that the Pajajaran escorts was ambushed by Majapahit... ...he asked them to surrender on their knees. And that's how the Battle of Bubat begins. You know how devious they are now? Those are just myth and legends. And the blood running in your vein is not pure Sundanese blood. The one you were so proud about, now it's mixed with Javanese too. What are you talking about? Did I ever ask for this Javanese blood? If I knew it was a Javanese blood... ...I'd rather die with my honor intact as a Sundanese. My God. You should calm down. You can't talk like that. And there's no such separation between Sundanese and Javanese. We all live in Indonesia, and we have Bhinneka Tunggal Ika. If everyone acts like you, then you'd only be able to live in Sunda. Says who? I can go wherever I want. Because of the respect and tolerance with each others. Abah. Don't you feel ashamed mocking the Javanese? While their blood is now running through your vein. And until when are you going to preserve this hostile culture? Enough of this! One more thing. The name of the doctor who did your surgery is... ...Dr. Susetyo Bambang Hartono Diningrat. A Javanese. No, no, no! - Come on, Dad. - I said no! I don't want to see him. You said you agree to let Citra marry with Reza. Just go ahead and get married, I will give you my blessings. But I won't be on the same table with that Sundanese. There's no more Sundanese/Javanese. Everyone is the same. And your blood is now running in his. Yeah, just forget about that. Come on. Abah, Ambu, this is Jamal. He's my friend who helped me and Citra to get back together. You look familiar. Where could I have seen you before? Maybe you're mistaken, Sir. This is the first time we met. No, I'm sure we've met before, but where? Maybe just my look-alike. Because my face is really common. Even on my way here, some people mistook me as Baim Wong. In fact, I'm more handsome than him. Let's go. I'm not noisy, right? That's what I'm talking about. You dropped the mallet. Cokot (bite). - Cokot? - Yeah, cokot. You dropped that. See, I'm biting it now? Sir, he meant to pick it up. Not to bite it in Javanese. Good afternoon. Hello, Ma'am. Hi, Reza. Come on, shake hands. Next time, pick a Sundanese restaurant. I'm allergic to these. I want to order the most expensive food in the menu, and make him pay for it. Stop it! Thank you. So let's get straight to the point. Pick the date. And I will be your wedding organizer. You can pick the theme, Javanese or Sundanese. - Sundanese. - Javanese. - Sundanese! - Javanese! - Sundanese! Sundanese! Sundanese! - Javanese! Javanese! Javanese! Remember, my blood is inside your body. Who asked for it? Go ahead, take it back. I don't need it. No way! I don't like my blood being transfused into your body. Just so you know, my blood contains cholesterol, uric acid. Enjoy! I never asked for it! Take it back! Here! Take it! Okay, how about we do ant-man-elephant? Whoever wins, we'll go with the winner's pick. Bring it on. One, two, three. One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three! Morning! Hey. That's more like it. Back to work. What brings you here today? Can you be a wedding organizer? Who's getting married? Me, of course! I've found someone. Who are you going to marry? Her. You... So? Full fantastic or not? Full fantastic! Perfect! I'm begging you... ...to listen to my story... You can cry like that. I'm an actor. I'm pregnant!
