I haven't had a slip in weeks And it's not a secret society! These are the women who run the men who run the state I mean maybe one of them would be interested in investing in your business. Yeah, maybe. But that's not what's going to happen. What's gonna happen is I'm going to get locked in talking to that condescending douchebag. What's his face? Stop Zachary Yes but stop. I only have three 'fake listening' faces for a party and he burns through all of them. Even before he gets to: "Yknow, wine is like a poem" This party isn't fun. It's work.

I got them for half off It's not like I was being reckless No. 450 for gloves is... great! Okay. They were $1800. And I would prefer if we could just drop this. Philip. Alright.

I need to get out of the house These women worshipped my mother And one way or another They are damn-well going to respect me too. So what are they serving at this thing? We'll have something beforehand. There's not going to be food is there? We'll have something beforehand. How much did these tickets cost? [LONG SIGH] Okay. Based on that answer: I'm going to say this is about a... two-thousand dollar thing. They were a thousand and I had to work very hard to get them. Just saying. For... five-hundred dollars each Maybe they could give us a little food? They were a thousand each. And I prefer if we didn't go on and on about this. It's not going to be an all-the-time thing and you know this matters to me It was a two-thousand dollar answer! You said "about two-thousand" So: No. That isn't the same thing. And going on and on forever won't change the fact that we will have something... beforehand. Right. It's a fundraiser Philip. Can't raise funds if you're spending them So basically you're telling me she's good at saving money. Just not yours? We're going to go broke trying to keep up with people who are going to be dead by the time we catch them. By her damn self. How's your group out there today? My group? Glad you asked.

"Shit the bed" - Phil The fucking dog don't even lick my hand no more. -Lew, you deserve this! -You deserve to taste the fruits of your labor You deserve 4 nights a year at a luxury property with your wife!

Now you're talking price! Now he thinks he's going to get outta here He starts being polite again! That's your 'in' You're talking price. You're talking last minute deals.

My father died today. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm the last 'Heart' left I'm the next in line to go. Uh, turns out there's a will I have to meet with the lawyer in the morning, so... Wow. It's just you'd always said your father WAS dead so... I'm not exactly sure what to give you here, but whatever you need. I guess I can keep a secret if I'm mad enough. Well, technically you just blew it by telling me about it. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry... So sorry, I'm running late. Thank you so much for meeting me here! It's so great to finally meet you. Nice to meet you. Wow. You're younger than what Dandy described! Oh? Oh, don't take that the wrong way. I mean it is a compliment. It just came out this big mouth of mine. Heh. Well I see it says here: He left nearly everything to you. The cars. The house. All the funds remaining in the accounts. Which turns out to be quite substantial! I don't want the house. You don't want the house? Well, there is one other person listed here I guess - do you want the house to go to them? What's the other name listed? Uh, let's see down here... "Leslie Heart" His daughter. Ma'am. I am Leslie Heart. (sighs) I'm so sorry. What time is it? Ten past ten. Have you seen another lady walking around here? Thankfully not. Leslie. I understand that you lost touch with your father? Yes. Quite awhile ago. He always remembered the last time you visited the house You had asked him for something Something you had ALWAYS wanted! What did I say I wanted? [HORSE GRUNTS] Wait! THIS is the thing? Well not this horse exactly, but Oh god.. I wanted a horse when I was nine! That's what it says right here! Your father would've loved to have seen your face! Typical. [HORSE GRUNTS] -How do you get rid of a horse? I have no idea. I'm not in the mob. It is SO rude to leave behind a burden on someone GUILT or otherwise. They said they had enough supplies at the house to take care of it for a month So let's let them take care of it -We'll figure out what to do. We have to get rid of it! I'll ask around. What do you think it's worth? It's got to fetch a decent amount! I don't know. We could put an ad with a picture in the paper See what happens. No, no, no. The classifieds? That is the last thing we need.. The Heart name in the backpages alongside yards sales and prostitutes. Ooo! What about Richard from work? Yeah. He can't afford a horse right now. No, but you said he's always at the track. Maybe he knows somebody. Okay...I'll ask. I can't believe the money is all gone. -Every cent! To some uptown hussie named Harriet. Who evidently didn't want the horse either Or she'd have gotten that too! Oh hey man, there you are! Phil! My man. Bring it in. Man! I know hockey! Hockey's some wicked shit! I'm out here trippin' Some guy, team The Whalers! They won. All I know is I'm up two grand! Nice. Yeah, yeah. Hey I wanted to ask you this: Do you know anyone down at the track who might be interested in buying a horse? This is a beautiful beast. It's a horse Where'd you get this from? Leslie's father died. Again. Don't ask. And he left it for us to figure out You ever think about racing? No. That sounds expensive. You already got the horse Phil. There's a lot of money around that race track. Those funny hats ain't free baby You think? You don't think we should sell it? Bruh Phil. Sheesh. Bruh look: I just so happen to know a dude named Barry Okay. He was a hot-shot jockey Hot as TV! And he's looking to get back into training Okay. Right? Yeah. It's like some cosmic shit! This don't happen just like... So, your girl, like she cool? Like... Like she into crooked shit? What illegal shit are we talking about? I'm just saying though He got into a little trouble. I'll let him explain... to you what happened I don't know a man's business like that. It's all good. Yeah, ya dig? So: I introduce you to Barry I can call him up Matter fact look It's 4 o'clock His ass should be up. If he ain't up Imma get his ass up! Call him. Yeah. Don't forget to tell your girl: Shit...IS illegal. -I might tell her something different Yeah! [LAUGHS] Who the hell are you? I'm Philip. Richard's friend with the horse? Oh. Do I smell pot? No? You didn't just smoke pot before you got here? No! Come into my office. So! You're looking to get into the pony business Thinking about it, yeah. Well, it's very, very pricey. It can be expensive! What are we talking about? Depends on what you're looking to do. Well my girlfriend inherited a horse and we're looking to make as gluttonous use out of it as possible You've come to the right place! You like to gamble? Used to. Used to do some sports betting, yeah. You cheat on your wife? -AH HA HAA! You can't do that! Look at how long you paused! and you did the thing with the shake with your head! I wasn't ready for the question. Well you better be ready when your wife asks that! Trust me! I'm not even married and why are we talking about this? What does this have to do with horses? The response to those two questions tells me just about everything I need to know about a person. Well, I've never cheated. Ahh! You don't have to sell me! Okay? I'm not judgemental! I'm just saying I have a business to run here. I don't need sexual deviancy around my business. I'm a professional! Mister Barry! Si! Lavar el caballo! Sucio! SI! Si. -Jesus... I told them I understood what they were talking about so they wouldn't stand around and bad mouth me in Spanish. Let's go see what they're screaming about. BARRY How good do you want to be? PHILIP What do you mean? BARRY What do YOU mean? PHILIP I wanted someone to train our horse? Well, I mean You wanna just win a few races? Or you tryna get rich? Ideally both. What's the difference? Well maybe there's a situation that's available where it doesn't necessarily matter how we finish in the race. Is this situation cheating? Well, look: I wouldn't go crazy trying to judge it. I'm just saying there's a situation available for someone who's willing potentially to follow up on it. Potentially! Okay? Maybe we stop the horse at home. What does that mean? "Stop them at home" Y'know, like, there's too many lookie-loos and camera's at the track now. So what we do: is we just won't wind her up all the way PHILIP Do you ONLY speak in riddles? Quit playing games with me Jack! Barry! What are you doing? Are you with the jockey club? Jockey Cl-- ARE YOU WITH THE HORSE POLICE? The "horse police"? Did Katzman put you up to this? I don't know who that is! HA HA HA HA That's exactly what Katzman would say to tell you! This isn't my first rodeo, Will Lockheart! I don't know who that is either! -Will you please put that down! -I'm just trying to bring some peace to my house and I'm trying to appease my girlfriend! Help me out! -You're a GUY! Look. I don't know you. Y'know, people they they come around here. They start asking me all these questions. They actually send OFFICIALS out here to SPY on me! They do that? Probably! Didn't Richard fill you in that I was coming? -Yeah. He filled me in on the horse! He didn't fill me in on YOU! Oh hey! That looks like our horse. That's "Oreo Express"! He was my finest champion! He won a lot of money for me until he started getting lazy. Now look at this! What a life! I wish someone would hose me down every night Now, he can't win races. He can't stud. He's just freeloading on me like everybody else around here. Good looking animal though! Exactly! They're all beautiful animals. Nobody knows anything. That's why the plan works! Okay so what's the plan? UH... We can talk about that at some other time. Or juncture. Phil. I guess I should know what you're doing but I don't. This is a game that's best played quiet. You don't know... who's listening. When they're listening. Or what they're listening to. We operate in silence here Phil. Silence. [WHISPERS] What's...the...plan? I'm not going to-- I can't tell you the plan You'll just cut me out of it. I'm not stupid! C'mon... -Look Phil I have... trust issues. -My whole life it's been this way. -I give to people a hundred percent. And then just as I get a fish on the line They cut bait. Well, that's not me. I would never do that. Okay, I'm going to sound it out for you. Things have not been going well since Oreo went soft. And all I have is this place. -And the banks are calling and they're sending people around all the time and it turns out there's only so many places you can hide on a ranch. It's not like I can slip into a nearby cave! Yeah, well, I understand. We haven't been having the best time of it lately either. Everyone's got a sad story Okay. I just need a little information so I can go home sell it to Leslie. Who is Leslie? Leslie is my girlfriend! Is she going to be a problem? Yes almost certainly she's going to be a problem. Ohh I get it. The salesman who can't sell himself to his wife Yeah, she's not my wife. AH HAAA! SEE? Now look: Here's what we're gonna do: We lose a few races. We get the handicap way down. and then when things look good we make a bet and we clean up! How much? -Y'know, a horse, if he was lucky and he ran a few races and won you could win a hundred thousand dollars in a season. -but outside of the race track where the REAL race is running: You could make a hundred thousand dollars in a MONTH! And that was twenty-some years ago. Okay so what happens though when someone finds out? Like who? -I don't know! Like Cat Man or whoever it was you thought I was when I showed up It's not against the law to lose a race! So what? The jockey's in on this too? Yeah because it's easier than trying to explain it all to the horse. Weren't you too tall to be a jockey? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. But y'know what happened was I grew 5 inches right in the middle of my prime and it ruined everything. Which is exactly what my ex-wife said to me on our honeymoon! How'd you get in trouble? You name it! With her? She's a bitch! Y'know, you talk to her: Hi Honey! and-- With RACING. Oh. Okay. That. Well what happened was It was this whole... doping scandal. I got confused! -I stuck the steriods in MY ass. I was supposed to put it in the horse's- How could you make a muh Okay look: You need to find a trainer and I need to find a horse who runs faster than I do. So let's do this: We'll defer the cost of feed and labor. Okay. Right? I'll train the horse. -Kind of. But I still have to wet my beak a little bit But what I'm going to do for you is I'm going to cut my usual fee from six thousand to three thousand dollars a month and then after that Twenty cents of every dollar going forward. Standard. We are having a hard week at our house I'm not sure I have three extra grand this month. -Well we BOTH will...if you trust me and stick with the plan! Now what do ya say? Do we got a deal on this? Come on! Hop in! The The business is warm! Alright! Now, remember: You have to explain the plan to her It's not my job to deal with an angry wife! I understand. And she's not my wife! Okay. Hey! Can we go smoke some pot in your car? Before you go? Yeah, I gotta get home, okay? OOOH! So you admit you have pot in your car now, dontcha? -I gotta go tell Leslie The Big Plan Ohhh yes! Go tell Leslie The Big Plan I wouldn't want you to get in trouble with your FI-UNS-SEE It's not like that Barry. [Philip chews loudly] Mmmmphh. So how much money are we talking? Those funny hats aren't free! What does that even mean? Are you high? -Y'know? I kind of smelled something like it out at the ranch. -That must be what you're smelling. -Anyways! I did what you said. -I looked into it. [DOOR KICKED OPEN] PHILIP Perfect deal PHILIP He takes the horse. We can afford it. PHILIP Horse gets pampered PHILIP We make money the whole time PHILIP It's a great situation! [GLASS SMASHING] LESLIE How do you know he's any good? PHILIP I used your idea. I asked Richard. PHILIP He recommended him. He's this guy who used to be this famous jockey and something happened, he got accused of some shit. But he's back now! And he's ready to get into business with us. Well so why exactly did he leave? I dunno. We didn't really get into it. I had to be home for dinner. [CAR STARTS] PINKY Grow up Bitterman! PINKY We know you're hiding. [LOUD CRASH] LESLIE Well, I would have to meet him. PHILIP He said he can come pick up the horse anytime. PHILIP You can meet him then. PHILIP I just thought the Trumans were in the horse racing... scene so... maybe that'd be a good way to get in with them, but y'know, we don't have to. ♪♪♪ LESLIE Don't say anything about racing or the horse to anyone! PHILIP I'm going to try not to say anything all night. PHILIP Thank you! LESLIE Hi, hello, thank you! Put it on! You HAVE to wear it. I'm not wearing it. You're wearing it! Don't embarrass me. Wanna hit the bar? Please behave. I don't ask you for much. Folks! Could I have y'alls attention for a minute please? Thank y'all very much. I promise I'll make this short and sweet Kinda like my grand-daughter over there! [LAUGHTER] -But anyway uh... I appreciate y'all being here tonight.

The fact that you trust me with your money really motivates me to be the best treasurer this state's ever seen!

Factional? "Fractional" ownership. "Factional" We don't, we don't generally use "timeshare" in the business anymore because of the way you said it. So you are rebranding sir! That is rebranding. Using language. You would do well in politics. That is called "spin" my friend. That is called Good Spin. I like it! I'm- It's aspirational! HEH HEH HEH! Mmmm. MmmMm. [SLURP SOUNDS] Oh this wine is NOT aspirational. It's heavy on the "ass". Surely... Your mother left you with enough pieces to get you by. You know, until you could appreciate a little and Afford to buy a a few pieces. That woman had more rocks than Wilma Flintstone. Mmm!

When you speak to Barry tomorrow... You tell him: I'm In. PHILIP Look at you! BARRY Why don't you put her in #3 alright? HANDLER Yes sir. BARRY Philip! Hey. Wait a second Philip. This isn't...

But I can see from THAT face that you're not happy! And I'm also a little bit frightened of you. Leslie, right? Yes. Hello. Good to meet you. So, Philip's been telling me that there's good money in racing. Yeah. You can make a small fortune from racing. Unfortunately you usually start out with a big fortune Well- We're new to this. I mean, I-I just want to find out how we can get started. Alright. Let's grab a drink and talk about it. What do ya say? Let's go. Let's do it! BARRY Look and learn! Watch and learn! BARRY Watch and listen! Listen and learn! PHILIP Okay. Stop talking. BARRY Okay. MAN Nice shot, Bailing Barry! These bar cues are bullshit! I can't work with this. It's not professional. So how long before she's ready to race? Why wait? We'll breeze her an eighth of a mile for a few days "Some Like It Heart" That's her name! -She's part of my family now and... she deserves a name. We'll breeze "Heart The Horse" half the length of the race so she'll burn out early -Little extra food at dinner time. -Bucket of beer for breakfast instead of hay. PHILIP They drink beer? BARRY Oh, they love it! Compared to real training it's actually kind of a deal for them. Wait. That's the plan? You WANT to lose? -We talked about this for an hour and a half the other day! What's wron-- he didn't tell you any of this? What'd you get in trouble for back when you raced? Fine! You want me to tell you? I'll tell you. I owed some money to some local guys who worked for some foreign guys who made it very clear to me that I was to come in fourth or worse They put me on a horse called "Golden Nugget". It won three out of it's last four The money they were going to win from THEIR horse winning was supposed to cover my tab They'd get paid out. And all at the expense of me risking everything I've ever worked for. ANNOUNCER Annnd they're off! Madeline Winter, Hustle Hard and the Grace Of God are off and away Glass Firmament fires to the front but it's Golden Nugget winning the early lead!

You said we had to win one for this whole thing to work. Yes. But we need to cherry pick. Do a little research. Make sure it's a race we actually have a shot at. Well, we have three weeks to make it work. I haven't asked anything of anyone during this and I know you don't know me very well, Barry, but I have been EXTREMELY reasonable so far I got into this for money and spite by the end of it I WILL have won at one or the other.

Yeah, well, we had one recommended to us It was a friend of mine, I went to him, asked him and he recommended me one, yeah, Hmm Have you at all familiarized yourself with Rule 155.5 of the Jockey Club Code Of Ethics? It states: "No person shall be guilty of any improper conduct or inappropriate behaviour" Is this about the jockey ruckus? I wish it was. LESLIE Okay. And then what did you say? Y'know, I just bullshitted. I said, y'know we're doing, erm-- we're learning our way we're, we're losing some races but Barry's been very professional This guy did NOT like Barry. Okay? I understand that because I barely like Barry. But he hasn't lied to us yet. Y'know, he seemed to buy it. Y'know, he's trying to mob me up He's trying to scare me with his mob tactics and I'm not-- "Mob tactics" Mob tactics, just tactics. I'm not saying he's in the mob. I'm saying he's mob adjacent. [LESLIE SIGHS] It'll be fine. Yes he was throwing all sorts of regulations and rules at me but there's a difference between regulations and laws, okay? We're not breaking laws We're breaking rules.

Okay we should be focusing on the race tomorrow Yeah, it's going to be hard to finish last now, right? LESLIE What do you mean? -What do I mean? We're going to start to run Oreo at the back of the pack Gotta get the handicap down so we can get the money back up! LESLIE Why would we do that? BARRY I don't understand! We're Playing Possum!
