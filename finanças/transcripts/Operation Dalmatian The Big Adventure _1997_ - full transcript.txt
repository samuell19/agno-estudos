[music playing] -Back again, Justin? -Can we look at the puppy? -OK. -I know where they are. JUSTIN'S FATHER: Whoa,whoa-- slow down, Justin. -Which one do you want to see? JUSTIN: All of them. -[LAUGHING] OK. Come here, baby. Now be careful how you hold them. Puppies need to feel safewhen you pick them up. -OK, you don't like that? OK. -You know, there is one more puppy. JUSTIN: There is? -Some film company used him for a movie, and then brought him in here to sell. -[EXCITEDLY] Oh, yes! This is the one. Can I please have this one? -You know, puppies are a big responsibility. Maybe we should wait tillyou're a little older. -I could take really goodcare of a puppy if I had one. I'm getting older every day. [sneezes] -That sounds like a nasty sneeze, young man. -Oh, honey, you've got a fever. We better get him to grandma'shouse, and get him to bed. [christmas music playing] -How's the patient? -Still awake. -Waiting for Santa. -Oh, I just set everything up in the kitchen. Maybe I'll tuck him in witha little bedtime story-- help him get to sleep. -Mom always tells the best bedtime stories. -Just don't let him keep you up all night. -Oh, I won't. -Merry Christmas Eve to you two. -Thanks, mom. -Merry Christmas. -Goodnight, Mom. -Grandma-- -What are you still doing up? -I can't sleep. I want it to be morning already. -You can't rush the morning, Justin. It comes on its own time-- no one else's. Are you feeling any better? -Not really. -Well, let's check yourtemperature one more time. -What time do you thinkSanta Claus will get here? -Some time between now, and morning. He's probably circlingaround out there, right now, as far as we know, waiting for you to go to sleep. -How does he know that? -It's not polite to talkwith your mouth full, Justin. -I know. -I remember when I had a fever like this once. I had to stay home from school for a whole week. Here, open up now. -I wish I could stay home from school. But I had to go, and get sick over Christmas. -Aw, you're still burning up. -Are we going to take pictures tomorrow? GRANDMA: Of course. We always take family pictures at Christmas. -I don't want anybody to see me like this. They're going to call me lobster boy. -[GIGGLING] It's just yourbody's way of healing itself, Justin. Besides, it's not all that important how you look on the outside. It's what's on the inside that counts. I knew someone once who turnedseveral different colors all in one day. -You did? -Uh-huh. It was just before your great-grandparents moved into this house-- back in 1948. GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: The town was going through some rough times back then. After they closed the mill,and people started moving away, the city was so broke, they even had to close the firehouse to save money. There was a beautiful Dalmatianthat kept hanging around the station hoping that oneday the fireman would return. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: When are they going to come back, and feed me? If I have to scrounge one more scrap of food from a garbage can, I'm going to-- Oh, someone's coming. Well, who's this? Huh, she obviously doesn'tcome from a very rich family. But hey, at this point,beggars can't be choosers. All right, I might have only one shot at this. I'd better get into my best, how much is that doggy in the windows pose. -[GENTLY] Aw, hello. Good boy. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: OK, here we go. Adorable doggy looknumber two-- the sad eyes. -Oh boy, I sure wish Icould take you home with me. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Yes, yes! -But I can't. [dalmatian groans] -Ever since papa lost his job at the mill he's been having a hard enough time feeding himself, mama, and me. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Well, hey, I'm not expecting gourmet dog food here. Scraps off the table are fine. Anything is better than a canned lunch. -You sure are a sweet one, though. I gotta get home for supper. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Supper? Please don't tease me like this. -Bye, now. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Sheseemed like such a nice girl. I wish I had a home. Oh boy, maybe she's having second thoughts. Oh please, oh please,oh, please, oh please, oh please, take me home with you. What have I got to lose? [music playing] -Hey, it's you. It's you. Did you follow me all the way out here? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: I think there might still be a chance here. -Don't you have a home? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:Look, I can do tricks, too. Watch this. -Oh, look at you. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Pleasedto make your acquaintance. -I guess there's no harm in taking you home just for one night. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Yes! -Come on, boy. I'm right behind you. Let me see. What should I name you? How about Chester? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Chester? Do I look like a Chester? That's more of a name fora bulldog than a Dalmatian. -Maybe not. What about something like Sherlock? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Do Ilook like a detective to you? -Hmm. I know. Baskerville! I'lll call you Baskerville! DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Baskerville? What kind of name is that for a dog? -Here, Baskerville! Fetch! DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:The things we do for food. -Good boy, Baskerville. Good boy. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Like I said, beggars can't be choosers. GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: Timeswere tough for us then. Your great-grandpa couldn't findany work after they closed down the mill even though hewent out looking every day. Mama made a little money everynow, and then, selling clothes. But it was barely enough tokeep a roof over our heads, and not much left over for food. JIM: [sighs] What's for supper tonight? -Stew. -Oh wow, it smells good. -Any luck today? -No, afraid not. -It's OK, Jim. Tomorrow's another day. Tomorrow's another day. GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: Mamaknew how to make a little go a long way-- by puttingwhatever we had all together in a big skillet, and making stew. Mama got very good at it. -Here, taste this. Tell me what you think. How is it? -Perfect. -OK, Baskerville, you stay here for now, all right? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Oh,can't I please come in? Please, please, pretty please? -I have to wait till the perfect time to ask them if I can keep you. You'll be all right. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: cooking sure smells good. I can't even remember the last time I had a home cooked meal I could use a snack. Maybe there's a trashcan around here. -Hey mama. Hey papa. JULIETTE'S MOTHER: Hi. -How's my girl? -Good. How was school today? -Oh, fine. I have a book report due on Monday. I have to read the "Hound ofthe Baskervilles" this weekend. -Well, you ought to haveplenty of time to do that. Not much going on except the dog show. -Mama, would it be all rightif I ate supper outside? It's really nice out. -Sure, if that's what you want to do as long as it's OK with your father. -Go ahead. But make sure you don'tleave any scraps out there. I don't want the raccoonsgoing all over the place. -Thanks, papa. -Thank you for this food-- DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Oh,yes, yes, thank you, thank you. What? Where's my plate? Um-- JULIETTE: Are you hungry? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Who me, hungry? I'm famished! Oh, yes. Yum! Thank you. Thank you. JULIETTE: Mama makes the best stew, don't she? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Mycompliments to the chef. This is the best stew I've ever had. [yawning] Well, the accommodations aren't all that great. But the food is suregood, and so is Juliette. I wonder what's for breakfast. JULIETTE'S MOTHER: Come get youroatmeal before it gets cold. -You sure know how to treat a man like a king. Even a poor man out of work-- -Oh, papa, you'll find a job. I know you will. -That's right. Listen to your daughter. She's got the right attitude. Never give up hope-- never. -Yeah, you're right. Thank you for this food, and especially for my wonderful family. I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, but in case you haven't noticed, our cash situation is getting kind of low. I do love my family. I want to take care of them. If you happen to have a spare one laying around, we could sure use a miracle some time soon. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: What should I do here? Should I go pawing at the door? No, no, that might seem a little pushy. I have to remember to keep mygood canine etiquette or-- ooh, it's back to the trash can cafe for me. Patience, patience-- I don'twant to blow a good thing. -Are we going to go tothe dog show this weekend? -Oh, honey, I have too manychores to do this weekend. -Do you want to go, papa? -Juliette, I can't.I've got to go find a job. I've got to put food on this table. I was thinking of going backto the canning works today. -Didn't you go there two days ago? -Yeah, but you never knowwhen they need somebody else. You know, I heard that Cousin Bob over in Hooverton--he's doing pretty good. -Oh, I'm so glad to here that. JULIETTE'S FATHER: Seems likehe got $50.00 in seed money, started selling hardware supplies off the back of his truck. In no time, he had enoughmoney to open his own store. -Is it all right if I go to the park today? -As long as you got enough time to make sure your homework's done. -I'm almost finished with the book. -All right. -Thanks, papa. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Here she comes. Oh boy, breakfast in bed-- Mm hmm. JULIETTE: Morning! DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:Yes, it's a nice morning. Where's breakfast? -Good morning! Did you sleep well? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Well, Iwould've preferred a nice rug in front of a roaring fireplace. But compared to the alley behind the fire house, I can't complain. -Look what I brought you. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Is that it? A biscuit? No steak, and eggs? Oh, well, at least the service isn't so bad. -Come on, Baskerville. We're going to go see some of your friends today. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: I don't have any friends, except for you. [music playing] JULIETTE: Boy, Baskerville, wouldn't it be nice to have $250.00? Then papa could start a businessof his own just like Uncle Bob. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: That would mean bye-bye biscuits for breakfast. YELLOW LAB [VOICEOVER]: Oh, where's my groomer? -Excuse me, all dogs haveto be on a leash today. JULIETTE: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. DOG SHOW JUDGE: Oh, that's all right. JULIETTE: Come here, Baskerville. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Ihate wearing these things. DOG SHOW JUDGE: Oh, what a beautiful dog. -Isn't he? -Yes, what's his name? JULIETTE: Baskerville. -Oh, well hello, Baskerville. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:Well, she's got good taste. DOG SHOW JUDGE: Oh, what a sweet thing. Why aren't you over with the other contestants? JULIETTE: Doesn't it cost money to enter? DOG SHOW JUDGE: Well, yes,but-- oh, I've got an idea. I'll give you this note. And you take it over to Mrs. Hutchins over there at the entry desk, andshe'll give you a number. OK? JULIETTE: Thank you! -Oh, you're welcome. -Thank you. And you better hurry up. Because the judges are aboutready to make their rounds. -Oh, thanks. Come on, Baskerville. -Good luck! -Come on. Thank you! ANNOUNCER: All contestants, the preliminary judging will begin in five minutes. Please proceed to thejudging area at this time. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: I don't know anybody here. YELLOW LAB [VOICEOVER]: Look what just fell off the fire truck. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Yikes,is that one dog, or two? DOG SHOW CONTESTANT: Can you believe they're letting Dalmatians in here? DOG SHOW CONTESTANT: Smellslike he needs a bath. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Doesn'tseem like I'm too welcome here. Hey, there's Precious. I remember her from the fireman's picnic. -I am going to start practicingmy swing with the frying pan. How can I help you? -Umm, I'd like to enter my dog. -Well, there's a $5.00 entry fee. -Well, the lady over theretold me I should give you this. -Oh, yes-- well, fill in your name right there, and write your pooch's name right here. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Poochie? -I'm going to give you this to hang next to [GASPING] Baskerville. -Yeah. You don't think that's too weirdof a name, or anything, do you? -No, no. It's a lovely name, hon. Enjoy the show. -Thank you. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: [GRUMBLES] Poochie. [grunts] ANNOUNCER: Attention, allcontestants, the first round of judging for theTaterville Annual Dog Show is now underway in the judging area. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: HelloPrecious, long time no see. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Her name's Juliette. PRECIOUS [VOICEOVER]: Where'd you find her? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: By the fire station. PRECIOUS [VOICEOVER]: Oh, here they come. If you'll excuse me, I have tolook my best for the judges. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:Who are they to judge us? I mean, look at them. They have such funny looking bodies, they have to cover them up with clothes. PRECIOUS [VOICEOVER]:[giggles] Quiet, Baskerville. You're making laugh. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: And lookat that handbag she's carrying. Is that supposed to be fashionable? Humans waste so much moneyon dumb things, don't they? When they could be spendingtheir money on important things like food for us. ANNOUNCER: Attention, all contestants. The judges have nowdecided the five finalists in today's first round of judging. The five lucky contestants willgo forward to tomorrow's final, and compete for the grand prize of $250.00. GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: Afterthe judges talked in private for a while, they posted the finalists over by the entry table. I waited until after the crowd thinned out. And then I saw it. I thought I was seeing things--as if I was having a dream. But there it was in big, boldlettering-- the number 39. I felt like Cinderella. That night, at the dinner table, I decided to tell my parents about finding Baskerville in front of the fire house. Papa said it was good to feelcompassion for stray animals. He said I could keep him. -Grandma, I once asked my mom, and dad if I could have a puppy. But they said I have towait until I get old enough. -And your parents know what's best for you. -What did great gradman, and great grandpa think about Baskervilledoing good in a dog show? -No, I didn't even tell my parents about his being in the dog show. -Why not? -Well, at the time, I thought they might think badly of my not paying the entry fee. -Grandma, weren't you goingto tell me about someone who turned all sorts of different colors? -I was just about to get to that. Well, the next day, afterwe got home from church, I thought it would be a wise thing to give Baskerville a bath. All the other dogs were allso clean, and well-groomed, we had meet the competition head on. -I think you'll find some soap in the jars your mom put behind the house. -Just check, and see what's in them, first. -Come on, Baskerville. We're going to give you a bath so you look pretty for the judges this afternoon. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Oh, no. I just know it's going to be cold. I just know it. -That's not so bad, is it? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Personally, I'd rather be chasing rabbits. -When I get through with you, Baskerville, you're going to be theprettiest dog in the show. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: The things we have to go through tomake it in show business. -That's a good boy. This one looks like shampoo. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: [gasps] It's cold! [groans] -There we go. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Mmm, ooh, yeah. That's the spot I've beentrying to scratch all week. I can't seem to get my leg up there. That is nice. I could get used to this. Maybe a show dog's life isn't so bad, after all. -[SCREAMING] Mama! -That's permanent fabric dye. That'll never come out in a million years. -It has to come out. It just has to. -Oh, honey, it's all right. I reckon we can love a bluedog just as well as any other. -You don't understand, papa. I have to get him back to the way that he was. JULIETTE'S FATHER: Wait, you know, I heard Professor Strudelburger used to work for a big chemicalcompany back east. -I heard he was a little touchy, dear. -Well, he's all right. I mean, he's a littlestrange, that's for sure. A couple of months ago, I worked at his place. He's got a laboratoryright there at his house. I bet the professor could finda way to get that blue out. -Really? -Yeah. -I don't think that's such a good idea, Jim. I heard the professor doesn't like visitor. -Oh, mama. You know, what people say, and the way things are are sometimes two separate things. -Keep out. That means you. Well, we'll just tell him papa sent us, right? Let's go. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Maybewe should heed that warning. -Over educated human ahead. Proceed with caution. Let's go, Baskerville. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Why should we be worried about an over educated human? What's he going to do-- whack usover the head with his diploma? Juliette, are you sure about this? We're awful far from home. I don't like the looks ofthis, or the smell of it. I better let Juliette know. -What is it, Baskerville? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:The sign-- read the sign. -Come on, we gotta get you back to normal, so we can go to the finals this afternoon. What are you-- a scaredy cat? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Scaredy cat? That's a blow to a dog's ego. -Come on.DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Oh. This is pretty creepy. JULIETTE: Knock at your own risk. If no one answers, try the doorbell. But you may be sorry. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]:It's not so bad being blue. I can get used to this. Really, it's OK. Juliette, please, let's go home. [foghorn]DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Yikes! -Whatever you're selling, I don't want any. -Wait! Doctor Strudelburger, we need your help. My father said you were the only one in the world who could help us. -Somebody said something nice about me? -Yes, my father. He worked on your yard a couple months ago. And by the looks of it, you might want to call him again sometime soon. -Oh, yes, John Jenkins. -Jim Jenkins. -No, I'm afraid not. I'm Professor Strudelburger. -No, I know that. My father's Jim Jenkins. -You seem to be very confident about that. -He's my father. -Well, of course he is. -And you are? -His daughter, Juliette Jenkins. -Well, I'm glad you got that settled, Julianna. -Juliette. [screams] -Oh, I'm sorry. I was working in the lab when you rang. What's the problem? -It's my dog. -Dog? Dog? I don't see any-- Is it an imaginary dog? -Oh, no,no. He's quite real. [whistles] Baskerville, come here, boy. Don't worry, the professor won't bite. -Unless you're a ham sandwich, and then you better run for your life. -I could go for a hamsandwich myself, right now. -Where'd you get a blue dog? I'd like a blue dog like that. I'd love to have a dog. But I hate the colors they come in-- beige, black, brown, boring! [clears throat] -Listen, Doctor Strudelburger. Baskerville's the reason I came to you. You see, I was giving him a bath-- -Baskerville-- what a creative name for a dog. Why do people name their animalsRover, Spot, [singing] Fido? [baskerville barks] -Baskerville, hush! -You see, he agrees with me. -Listen, Doctor Strudelburger. The reason I came to you is because I don't want him to be blue anymore. -What's wrong with blue? I like blue. He looks good in blue. Look at the sky. It's blue. Do you want to change its colors too? Well, it'd be easy to make it brown. Is that what you want to do? -No, I don't want to make him brown. I want to make him white with black spots the way he's supposed to be. And I need to do it really quickly. Because he's a finalist inthe dog show this afternoon. -Hmm, yes, I see. Well, it's going to take some serious molecular reconfiguration. A dog's fur is constructedfrom dead cells pushing up through the pores. By using this powder-- whichis a distillation of apple blossoms, and rutabaga bark-- when activated by the photo voltaic charge--better known as sunlight-- the inverse magnetic pullon the cranium oblongata will cause phasing of the polarities, which will extricate the unwanted pigmentation from the follicles. [popping sound] Ouch! Did you follow me? -Didn't understand a word you said. -Neither did I. But what's itmatter, so long as it works, right? -Right. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: As longas I come out of this alive. Isn't that even being considered here? -When the prismatized lightinteracts with the solution, it's bye-bye blues. Oh, oh, I hope this works. Get a hold of yourself, Strudelbaker. -Burger! -Burger-- Strudelburger! You've got to have a positive attitude. Negative attitudes never get you anywhere. In the words of our late, great president, we have nothing to fear, but-- but, uh-- -Fear itself! -Right! -Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! -Oh my gosh! What have you done to him? -Oh, well-- Uh, theoretically, it should have worked, but hey, nobody bats a thousand. -Now they're using me for batting practice. -You've ruined him. -Well, look on the bright side--at least I got rid of the blue. -But you made him green. That's even worse than blue. -Who says green is any worse than blue? -People are going to think he's from Mars. -What's wrong with Mars? It's a nice red planet. And I'd like to meet theguy who started that rumor about people from Mars being green. Do you have any friends from Mars? -Not that I know of. -Well, there! Why couldn't people from Mars be purple? -Right now, I really don't carewhat color the people from Mars are. I just care about my dog. You can't have a green Dalmatian in a dog show any more than you can have a blue one. Oh, Baskerville, I still love you, even though you look likeyou just went swimming in a big bowl of split pea soup. Now matter what color you are,you're always beautiful to me. -Oh, you know, I canmake a killing with this. Being able to change the color of animal fur with a few little adjustments,I can turn rabbit fur into mink. I'll be seeing green all the way to the bank. -Well, I hope you enjoyall your money, professor. Because I wanted Baskerville to at least have a chance at winning that prize money. So my father could start his own business, and not have to come homeevery day looking so sad. Come on, Baskerville. Let's leave the professor alone, so he can work on his money-making inventions, instead of helping people like us. -Wait, Rulietta. Don't go. Strulietta, come back. Trulietta, wait, please. [groans] Oh, I'm so sorry. You, and Buster-- you come backinside, and I'll find a way, if it's the last thing I do. [boing] Oil of Locksbird Gooseberry bush-- -Oil of what? -Locksbird Gooseberry bush. Let's see. Lilac, Lily, too far, too far. Ah, here we are! Locksbird Gooseberry! A rare plant in the gingerfamily that grows wild in semi arid forest regions of North America. Used by the Bannocki, and other tribes to restore Buffalo hides, and animal firs to their original coloration. -That's what we need! -Merely rub the root of the Locksbird Gooseberry bush on the affected fir, and it will return to its original color in 15 to 20 minutes. -Where do we get thisLocksbird Gooseberry stuff? -As previously mentioned, theLocksbird is extremely rare. And according to legend, can be found only by a qualified Native American medicine man. -Oh, Baskerville, I knew thiswas all too good to be true. My horse, and carriage justturned back into a pumpkin. A great big, bright greenfour-legged pumpkin. -Hey, hey, what's with the sad face? -The dog show finals are in less than five hours. My sweet little plumb facehere doesn't have a chance in a million years ofwinning-- except for maybe in some dog show on Mars. -Oh, it's a cinch. All we do is boil up some Lockbird roots, and rub it all over Biscuitville here. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Biscuitville? -And, voila! No more green around the collar. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Isthere a memory problem here? That's the second timehe's mispronounced my name. -But I thought you said only an Indian medicine man could find it. -So? -So what do we do-- lookone up in the yellow pages? [laughs] JULIETTE: So how far awaydoes this medicine man lives? -Oh, as a crow flies, I'd say 120 miles. JULIETTE: [HYSTERICALLY]But Professor Strudelburger, we'll never make it in time. That's way too far of a drive. PROFESSOR: Who said anything about driving? GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: Even ifDoctor Strudelburger was taking me on a wild Gooseberry chase,with less than two hours before the dog show finals,what did I have to lose? JULIETTE: I've never flown in a plane before. PROFESSOR: I love having abird's eye view of the world. It puts everything in a proper perspective. JULIETTE: It's beautiful. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: So thisis how it looks to the birds. No wonder they're always chirping. I'll be chirping too if I could travel like this in a snap of my paw. PROFESSOR: There's his place down there. -I don't see any tepees. -This particular medicineman doesn't live in a tepee. He lives in a cave. [chanting] -Hi ya! [grunts] -It is I. Lawrence T. Strudelburger III. [screams] -You do what? -I am but a lowly inventor-- a slime mold on the food chain of the Industrial Revolution. I tread upon your tribal lands to humbly beseech your medicinal wisdom inlocating a specimen you known as Locheedie Wah Doo, which in pale face vernacular is known as Locksbird Gooseberry bush. -Get off your knees, you sorryunderbelly of a garter snake. -Ah, Hawitt Dog, it's good to see you, again. -You too, Strudey. -Strudey? -Yeah. Hawitt Dog, this is Pauliette. -Juliette! -Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I've got to remember that. What light through yonder window breaks? Tis the East, and Julie--Julie, Julie, Julietta! Ah-ha! Uh, Hawitt Dog, Juliette. This is Hawitt Dog. A [inaudible] world, certified, bonafide, and otherwise all-around qualified NativeAmerican medicine man. -At Your service. -How do you to know each other? -We went to Harvard together. -Yeah, he's got a degree in chemical engineering. -With a minor in basket weaving. JULIETTE: So if you have all that education, how come you're living in a cave? -I tried the industrialized life. And personally, I like itout here better-- that is, what's left of it. -Well, I invent things. That's what I do. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: He doesn't look like a Harvard grad to me. [barks] Oh, why's he looking at me like that? MEDICINE MAN [VOICEOVER]:What happened to do, Fido? Been frolicking in the algae pools lately? DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: I can't believe this. MEDICINE MAN [VOICEOVER]:What's the problem? Don't tell me you've never heard of a human who could speak dog-lepathy. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: To beperfectly honest with you, no I haven't. -What is this-- a staredown match, or something? -Hawitt Dog can communicate with various animals. For all we know, they're discussing the stock market right now. MEDICINE MAN [VOICEOVER]:So watch your thoughts, pup. I don't want to hear any wisecrack thinking out of you. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: I promise, I'll be on my very best thought behavior. MEDICINE MAN[VOICEOVER]: You do that. -I didn't catch his name. Was it Wit Dog? Is that it? Wit Dog? -HA-WITT Dog. HA-WITT. -HA-WITT? Is that it? -Actually, it's a nicknamethe professor made up for me. -His tribal name is quite long. -Well, not as long as DoctorLawrence T. Strudelburger III. -Well, actually, it is. Hawitt Dog is really apronunciation for the letters HWTDOG, which stands for hewho tap dances on gofers. -I like it. -She likes it. -I think it's a very nice name. But I don't think the gofers probably appreciate it too much. -Hey, you can't please everybody. So Hawitt Dog? -Yes, Strudey? -What about the wild Gooseberry bush? -Ah, the Locheedie Wah Doo. -Yahoo! Where do we find some? -I don't know if today is such agood day for Locheedie Wah Doo. -Please, Mr. Hawitt Dog-- he, who tap dances on gofers-- whatever your initials are. We have to find that wild Gooseberry bush Lock Dee Doodle Doo. And we have to find it fast. Cause if we don't, Baskervillewill never get back to his original color in time for the finals. And my parents, and I will never, ever have another chance like this to dig ourselves out of poverty. -She would make a good lawyer, this one. -Either that, or an auctioneer. So come on, Hawitt Dog. Are you going to be a party pooper? Or are you going to help thisyoung lady procure that plans she needs to make everything right again? -Oh, that's right, Strudey. Lay a guilt trip on your old college pal. Make me out to be the badguy after you made him green, and then only after you had made him blue. -How does he know that? -He's a medicine man. He's psychic. DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: I'll vouch for that. -How do you think I find the Locheedie Wah Doo? By tramping around in the woodsall day, and looking for it? The rarest plant in the world? JULIETTE: Please? -She said the magic word. -I have to first go into a trance before I find it, or procure it, as you say. [chanting] -What's he saying? -Heck if I know. I don't mean the theBannocki tongue. [chanting] All right, here's the deal. Locheedie Wah Doo. grows where the tree reaches with its hands towards the necks of far away travelers. -What the heck is that supposed to mean? -I don't know. That's what it translates into English. There are no footnoteswith psychic revelations. Sorry I couldn't be of much help. [chanting] JULIETTE: Doesn't look likethere's much hope, does it? PROFESSOR: You must nevergive up hope, Pointsietta. JULIETTE: Juliette! PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I have a problem with names. JULIETTE: I'll say. PROFESSOR: Yeah, I never have a problem with advancedmathematical calculations, numeric tables, things like that. But when it comes to simple names, I'm working on it, though, Juliette. JULIETTE: There's hope for you, yet! DALMATIAN [VOICEOVER]: Maybeif somebody makes him a cue card with everybody's name on it. [gasps] JULIETTE: Are you seeing what I'm seeing? PROFESSOR: What are you seeing? JULIETTE: Trees reaching theirhands towards the necks-- PROFESSOR: Of far away travelers. -[LOUDLY] Doctor Strudelburger,this is the place! -Take a look around. It's got to be here somewhere. -All right. Wait, wait, what am I looking for? I don't know what it looks like. -Broad, green semi-triangularleaves-- wild gooseberries don't come out until late summer, so you've got to look for-- there! -Where? -There! PROFESSOR: We won't know for 15 minutes whether this is going to work or not. -Well, we haven't got that long. The dog show finals are any minute now. PROFESSOR: Well, we better hop to it. [gasps of frustration] Oh! Oh, no! You're not going to do this to us, again! Not when we're on the very verge of victory! JULIETTE: Doctor Strudelburger,we can't wait any longer! We've got to run! Come on, Baskerville! PROFESSOR: Godspeed, Juliette! GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: Never inall my born days had I ever seen a dog run as fast asBaskerville did that day. There was no way I could keep up with him. JULIETTE: Baskerville, wait! I can't run that fast! ANNOUNCER: And the winner of the Second Annual Taterville Dog Show is Baskerville! GRANDMA [VOICEOVER]: When Ifirst go up to the winner's circle, I didn't recognize Baskerville. Because instead of the Locheedie Wah Doo making him normal again, itturned him a shade of red. The judges thought he was therarest breed of dog they'd ever seen, and awarded him the blue ribbon. It didn't turn out anything like the way I had hoped, and expected. But when all was said, anddone, as it turned out, everything worked out betterthan I could have ever imagined-- even in my wildest dreams. You should have seen the look on mama and papa's faces when Ibrought home the prize money. It was like all their prayershad been answered that day-- as if all of their dreams had come true. They used it to open a new restaurant in town called Mama's Home Stew. After word got around abouthow good Mama's stew was, people started driving in from all over the county to eat there. It was a roaring success. And papa would even make homedeliveries of mama's stew in the pickup truck. Papa never sold that old pick up. Because he said he neverwanted to forget that no matter how tough times tend to get,there's always the possibility of a miracle happening just around the corner. Eventually, they made enoughmoney to buy this house. But I'll tell you something, Justin. And don't you ever forget this. We had as much love in thatlittle old shack by the creek as we do in this house. That's what's important--not how big the house is, but how big are the hearts inside it. -Did Baskerville stay red therest of his life, grandma? -No. As it turned out, Hawitt Dog's Locheedie Wah Doo actually did work. It just took a while, isall-- about a week, I think. -Maybe you should findsome Locheedoodle for me. GRANDMA: [laughs] No, I just think a good night's sleep isthe best medicine for you. Goodnight, Justin. -I love you, Grandma. GRANDMA: I love you too, dear. -Grandma? -Try to get to sleep, or Santa might not get a chance to drop by. He's got a lot of deliveriesto make tonight, you know? [christmas music] JUSTIN: I can't believe it! -What is it, Justin? -Look what Santa brought me! -You must have been really, really good this year. -I've been the best! -Say cheese. [music playing]
