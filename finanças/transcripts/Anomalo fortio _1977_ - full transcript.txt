Anyone missing from your crew? - The bosun - Did you call the police? My agent did, I instructed him to find me a replacement Why such a rush? I reckoned he skipped off, I must leave as soon as I've loaded What's all this? A little after midnight, he was found stabbed on the western pier Can you gather the men the bosun hung out with? Of course... Mr. Avgeri? - Where are you sailing to? - The Far East Specifically? The port will be radio'd to me en route Good morning - The lady? - My wife She must be really fond of you, to accompany you on such a journey This is my first voyage as captain, and I wanted her by my side The bosun was out with you last night? YES - Where'd you go? - Drinking - Where? - In bars of course - And then? - Women - Which women? - Nothing serious - The bosun left with a woman? - Yea, I think I saw him with someone - What did she look like? - Can't remember, we were drunk Did he have beef with the crew? I heard he got along with them OK Who said so? Idid The first mate was acting captain before I took over You're free to go back to work now You'll need to come with me to sign a statement Madam What you looking for? The agency sent me Are you the new bosun? This way Tell everyone they're free till midnight We set sail, 6 am What'll you bring back for me? Anything you want You don't seem very happy I'd rather not go on this trip Because you're not going to be captain? - The captain's brought his wife - So what? We were together once Poor boy... You still have a thing for her, huh? - How's things? - Everything's OK - Meaning? - It's a knotty job The crew know what they're moving? They think the hold's full of cotton Has anybody gotten a whiff of anything? No-one has the faintest idea Only the first mate, who's a company man, knows that death is hanging over their heads - Nitroglycerin's no joke - Where's it headed? Search me What's important is that it gets to our people This is a tough job And the quantity's a lot greater than you think We can destroy all the oil wells, you got it? I'll do my best Report back whenever you can. Here's the code Learn it and burn it To take over the radio, I'll rouse the crew first After Gibraltar Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Why'd they brawl? A row over dice Who started it? They're a pack, they don't rat on each other Pirates, you mean How many years you been sailing as a bosun? Twelve S0 you should know the job Rattle their teeth some more Risky Keep your opinions for your own ship, when you've earned your stripes You can go now It's not right to treat him like that A ship isn't run with compliments But you're friends In this line of work, we all have a job to do and need to know it If you want to get those stripes go down to the hold at midnight - How did you find out? - None of your business S0? Why should the captain and the company reap all the profits? Do you know what you're saying? Get the engineers on board, and leave the crew to me You know what might happen? - We get fired - That's all? The shipment is illegal. It's in their interest to cover it up D0 you know what I can do? For me or the captain? Perhaps you feel sorry for his wife It's a lot of dough Let me think about it I'll wait - Was the captain here? - No Was the captain here? NO He's probably giving it to his wife - Are you going to belong? - No longer than I have to be I'm scared being alone If you need to, use this Bastard! Have you sunk so low? - Listen to me - No need, get out You have to listen I said out It's about the cargo It's none of your business, you're off the ship at the first port - You should hear me - Scram before I lock you up - You'll regret what you just said - We'll see about that - Milt0! - Shut it! Or I'll sort it so you never work again Get out! Go keep a lookout cause if the bosun catches us, we're clone - Let me shoot once, guys - Beat it, small-fry - Come on, call it - Shoot, fifty Fives - Let me go - Come on So that's what you're up to Count me in Well, come on then Square pair, pay up - Place 'em - Five - Two - Seven - All in - We're off Sixes - Next - I'm cashing out - Place it - I'm cleaned out - Place it, I got you - I don't like debts You think I'm gonna ask for it? I'm not loaning, I'm giving You do that? If you're riding on death, what do you need money for? Is that a Chinese proverb? If the ship rocks just a bit more, we'll all be blown to bits What are you taking about? Follow me N itrog lyceri n Nitroglycerin, and enough guns to level a city What about the captain? He's playing Russian roulette with our lives The scum! Let's force him to turn back HQW? - With these - You crazy? They'll hang us - I talked with the mate - And what's he say?

If the captain's involved then I'm with you And if not? He'll order me to report it and then clock at the first port You're right If he knew, he wouldn't have brought his wife - You try and draw it out of him - Right - H0w'd it go with Markonis? - Fine - When did you find him? - Just now - Anybody else see him? - Nobody Should I send a signal? Say that he killed himself - Got it? - No I won't allow any delay to this trip - And the killer? - He'll still be on the loose - Until we deliver the cargo - That's enough OK, what do you want me to do? Help me get him to his cabin And keep quiet I'll make sure you're OK Is that clear? Remember, O Lord, your servants, and forgive them their transgressions for none is sinless but thee who gives repose to the dead... With the saints give rest, O Christ, to the souls of Thy servants where there is neither sickness, nor sorrow, but life everlasting Through prayers of our holy fathers, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us Enough! Get him! Lies! Lies! He didn't kill himself. Lies, it's all lies! He was strangled. I saw him with my own eyes And he knows, I tell you He knows we're carrying nitroglycerin, he's gambling with all our lives Markonis is right Open up the hold, see if Markonis is telling the truth - Let's turn back - Throw the dynamite in the sea And the arms too And the arms! Nobody move One more word, I'll send you all to the gallows Milto! Chain him up Where they chain up murderers, crooks and criminals What are you waiting for, doll? Get to your cabin - Carlito! - At the ready Madam... I saved you Good, good, well clone The first phase has worked, our agent has control of the ship Now the radio needs to be booby trapped Whoever else tries to use it, has to die Fix the radio to be a trap Roger - Why are you hitting the bottle? - Cause I'm worried Something bad will happen Good thing we locked up the captain, but we've no idea where we're headed We'll be alright. Come celebrate with us - I'll be OK here - See you Go on, get out Is that how you greet the new boss? Bastard! If we got to know each other better, you might like me more We'll be docking soon and you know what you're in for then You think I'm one of those fools who'd put my neck in a noose? You tricked them?

Land ho! Land ho! Land ho! Land ho I'll be back Land ho, land ho Land You're right, it is land - Should we send a signal? - Not yet Stop! Stop I said! SHence! I want to talk to you First, tell me why you won't let me send a signal - It's not time yet - But we spotted land Let's surrender the firearms and dynamite to the coast guard Fools And what will you get for your troubles, acting the hero? - What do you mean? - The cargo is ours Yours - To do what with it? - For us to decide Spell it out Lots of money - We risked our lives, as it is - He's right - A fair share for each - No more going to sea There's something you're forgetting - He's locked up down below - And the company? Their dirty laundry, they'll cover it up And we'll keep our mouths shut Then hurrah for us Hurrah! - Stop this - You scared? - I prefer honest work - Don't mess this up We don't know where the cargo is headed, or who will collect it or pay for it - The captain will tell us everything - Ancl if he doesn't? He will, whether he wants to or not Leave it to me You two, come with me Are you going to tell us where the carg0's going? You have the radio Ask the company - They'll tell you everything - No, you're going to tell us Right, boys? How much? You want your payoff and get to keep your stripes Get the woman Now just the two of us Bastard! Amongst thieves... - What game are you playing? - Yours, from the other side And what do you want? To take the cargo where I want And I'll manage that just fine, because when you talk to them, you say this: North latitude 24, 8, 2, longitude 36, 1 Ancl remember, south of Yemen, where rebels will collect the cargo, to blow up all the oil wells And the crew? I'll get them to the gallows, so you can save your stripes If I refuse? Best that you don't You going to talk? You going to? He's a tough one Wonder if he will talk You going to talk? Stop, bastard! S0, I'm listening North latitude 24, 8, 2 Longitude 30, 6, 1 Somewhere south of Yemen - Let's go - Yeah Why did you wait to talk? We've hit a cyclone What should I do? We should have changed course Now it's too late You've lost the game A small shift in the cargo, ancl we'll all be blown apart Neither hooks nor ropes can hold it now It's in a storm a good captain proves himself And only you can save us right now Come on Further left More More to the left... Right! More to the right! YQU? Yes, and you know I can kill you if you don't cooperate - Whose game are you playing? - Mine Which is the most honest. And I need a good ally to help me Come on, stand up Full right! - Watch out for the wave! - I see it Come on I'm with you Want me to give it to 'em? The bosun is risking his head, he'd rather blow us all up than give in - So what can we do? - If we can survive this cyclone That's in God's hands And then? - Can I trust you? - I'm on your side You have my word, just as long as I know the plan - To get the crew back on our side - Impossible We'll manage it We need to find a way to pour oil into the water tanks to taint it I've hidden enough water for us They'll be rabid, they'll go crazy with thirst And then we'll head to port for fresh water, come on Right More to the right Still to the right The radio isn't far from here But if you even think of trying anything, you're dead Watch him! Straight on Finally, we made it Where are you going? Stop! Get the woman on deck It'll do her good to see who's in charge here And what happens to anyone who stands in our way G0 on Come on! What do you want? The bosun wants you on the deck right away Good morning... I have bad news for you The captain's dead, long live the new captain! Music! Stop! What are you doing? So now you're responsible for the captain's widow? Whore! Who could believe what a snake you are Take her away. Lock her in her cabin Why don't you come with me? Why? I can't control myself, who knows what I might do Only you can protect me from these brutes The water, the water! They tainted the water! Zafiris has been poisoned! The water, they tainted the water They tainted the water! Something's up - They tainted the water! - What is it? They tainted the water, Zafiris has been poisoned - Where is he? - Come with me - How do you feel? - Bad Someone's fucking us over here Who? He can't hide, I'll find him, I'll break him! I'll tear him apart and throw him to the sharks - But what should we do? - Beer! None left If you rationed them like the captain did, we'd have some left No matter, we'll manage, right boys? A few more clays, we'll tough it out And then we'll hit the port and drink the bars dry Fine words I tie mutineers to the stern I'm burning, water! I'm thirsty! Thirst kills you, boss Let's get to port They'll get us Better to rot in prison than to croak from thirst on deck Let me decide Every time I've decided for you, it's been good Isn't that right? TKS calling liaison TKS calling liaison, over We need to call to port for supplies, we need to resupply, over OK, hold on Absolutely not, or else we've lost the game Thirst is brutal S0's the diplomatic mess that will follow Tell him to do as I say I'll try What if they mutiny? Blow up the ship OK - What are you doing? - I'm thirsty Take him away! Lock him in his cabin And empty the water tanks You're late You're crooked Leave me alone For once in my life a woman asked me to protect her You were the first And can't you do that? How can I not do it Why did you call me crooked? I saw how you ditched Avgeri for the captain For you I would leave him as well I prefer the strong over the weak And you're one of the strong The sort I like I'll never be able to make you rich Don't forget that this ship and all its cargo are yours I'm no smuggler Then why did you do all this? Don't ask me Come on tell me For an ideal Ancl I thought you were smart What do you mean? For me, idealists are the biggest fools If the crew finds out, you're finished By then they'll all have died of thirst If they rebel? See this? A match is all it takes to turn the whole ship to ash Not even their bones will survive Something's up The compass fooled us We arrived 2O hours early We'll wait here for the cargo to be collected Let's get off to save ourselves Lower the boats Land is close You're leaving the cargo? To hell with the cargo We'll wait for you, and if you want our silence, you'll give us our cut Stop the engines Drop anchor and lower the boats Come on boys, come on! Watch it, watch your hand, slow Careful! Softly OK Let it go Slower You're leaving? I didn't think I'd have to ask you to stay with me So I thought You played your last cards underhand I had to win the game But they'll give you up to the authorities My guys will take care of them before they set foot on land Without even knowing who they are? What's the radio for? I'm just going to give the signal Hold on Can I have a cigarette? Any left? Just one Come here You want to thank me for saving your life? We're finally alone and no-one can bother us now THE END
