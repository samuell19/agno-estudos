DESCRIPTION OF AN ISLAND made by Rudolf Thome & Cynthia Beatt with the locals of Ureparapara Sound Max Hensser Cinematography Matthew Flanagan / Sebastian Schroeder Camera assistance Peter Sinclair Assistant editor Jeanette Massnick Editor Clarissa Ambach Production MOANA - Film GmbH Berlin - Do you feel alright? - Yes, but I'll be glad when I have land under my feet again. That's what I'm looking forward to most. Say, can you see that? That's the shipwreck. - Can you see it? - Ah, yes! - Yes? That's the French district agent ship that crashed into the reef because of the hurricane. - Where is it? - There on that side. Back there. - Ah! - Say, was it all a volcano in there? Yeah, I think so. I think the whole island was a volcano. And then maybe it broke in two after an explosion. But I don't know. - Is that the end of the bay up ahead? - I think that's... - Or does it continue around the curve? - I don't think so. No. - On the map, it's enclosed. - Yes. That means it ends over there. - Where's the village? - What? - Where's the village? - I don't know. It's supposed to be somewhere on this side. You can never see them at first. They're usually a little hidden in the woods. You can never see them at first. I think it's nice that it's going up that way. It gives such a wide impression. The island looks completely different if you approach it from the other side. I'm looking for people. Where are they? - Do they know we're coming today? - I don't know. I hope they heard our radio message. The water is so beautiful now. Just so undulating. I didn't imagine it to be this huge. I thought it would be much smaller. Seven kilometres, but with lower mountains. It's huge. So I think Mr. Selwyn is going to translate what I say, because I can't explain it well enough in Bislama. I think my brother explained something of what we want to do here, but I think I'm going to try and explain the book that we want to make. We've come here because we want to learn about everything on this island. About your customs. And your language. And your stories. And your songs. And also about what you plant in your gardens. And about the birds. And about the plants and the trees. And the fish and the shells. And we want to describe everything in our book. And each one of us is going to undertake a special area of this work. For instance, Paula is going to study all the plants and what you use them for. But to do this, we really need your help. I mean, we can't do it unless you help us with this work. And... And that's basically what we want to ask you: If we can stay here? And if you will help us with this work? And we also need a place to live for the six months that we want to stay here, and we need food during that time. Could you translate that? The custom chief asks this: Why did you come here? We are worried. Have you possibly come to take our land? Have you come with good intentions, or to steal from us? Well, maybe I can answer the first part. We came to Ureparapara because it's a small island, and we need a small island to be able to do all the work we've set out to do. And as for stealing the land, I mean, I know the history of the New Hebrides, and I can understand why Jonathan would think something like that. I can only say that we're not interested in taking anything away from you. We're only interested in learning about the way you live. And of course, because we need your help, we want to pay you for the work that you do. The custom chief says: "I think we want something that will help us all." Not money, but something else. - Like what? - Something like a boat. We can do it. We could take the money and go to the nearest island someday soon to buy a boat. That should work. We should be able to get one for $1800. Yes. Even though it might cost a little more. It's just that right now... This is the condition for us to be able to stay here. For six months. I think it's actually a good idea. It's actually much better than giving them money. Yes, I think so too. Me too. Just tell him. Okay, we agree. Of course, we have to find a boat. I feel reminded of gardening in my childhood. Every Sunday weeds were plucked. How do you say? They overlap. Have you seen this sea shell? It's twisted that way. Ah! No, I haven't seen it. They can open up to let air in. They're like... Like what? - Submarines. - Submarines. - Submarines. - Submarines. Yellow submarines. And when you cut them, the middle looks just the same. Do you look for fish? I don't like you. Nancy, can you get my shoes? Thank you, Nancy. Will you go under the water now, Nancy? I can't see anything. What are you doing over there? - Coconuts? - Oh, great. They collected them. Are you done here? Almost done. You could have helped us. That's good. Look at this. I've already got a blister here. This doesn't look good. It's bleeding. Yeah, from the hard work. While you were growing a beard. No, that was black sand. We all had a bath. But you should wash that first. - Are you going to the river? - Hand me that band-aid. Did we bring anything for lunch? I brought the sweet potatoes. They're in the leaves. Are they already cooked or do we have to cook them first? No, they're already cooked. - But do the chickens eat this? - No. Chickens don't eat seed. If they do, we kill them. Okay, which ground do we put on top? Just like this? Yes? - It's okay? - Yeah, show me now! Now we can see what it's like here. And we have a more precise idea of the actual order of the book. Or rather the structuring, and how everything fits together. Yeah, except I don't think we can work on it effectively here. In any case, we can't draw here. No way. You can't draw here. But do you want to take pictures? I'm gonna take some Polaroids of the necessary things. For example the kitchen and the interiors. And then you'll have taken enough pictures for me to use. And I'm gonna put it all on the table. You understand? And anything that I can put on the table and look at without disturbance, I will then draw as precisely as I am used to. - I don't like doing sketches. - Yes, of course. I understand. The drawings should be the way I like to do them. - And you know them. - Yes, right. As far as I'm concerned, I can't do any of it in Germany. And I don't want to. Because then I feel like I'll lose the tension. That goes for almost everything I do, such as the stories I write. Maybe that's the point. Because when I draw, I don't need the tension at all. The one that's here. Do you understand? If I want to draw accurately, I need a table, good light and real concentration. And here I constantly have to adjust to what the weather is like. When it rains, you can't draw. When the palm trees move strongly in the wind, you can't draw either. Because each time there's a different light. Oh, well. If it were that I drew differently, or could, it would be a different thing. But I can't. Maybe I'm too old to adjust. And what is the name for "roof"? - "Roof"? - Yeah. - "Roof" in Reef-Island? "Tschevalyeng" means one side. - One side? - One side of the whole house. - One side of the whole house? And one side of the roof too? - Yeah. Take the tape measure. Go to the corner of that house. Hold it tight. Come! - Here it was 5.40 meters. Right? - Yes. We're actually held together by the commitment we've made, namely the book. Right, the book. If I hadn't made that commitment, I probably would have left by now. I wouldn't say that. I'd stay here. I think it's great that I'm here. And I wouldn't leave either if I had the chance to go back tomorrow. I wouldn't do it, although I'm not doing so well here. No, I wouldn't go back either. But I would go somewhere else. Making the book is a long way off for me. I just want to live here for now. - Does it hurt you? - No. There are flies sitting over there. When I had the fever, I also got the feeling that you guys are somehow always afraid that someone who is feeling bad might run away as a result. - Really? - Yes. I've actually had fantasies like that. I thought if I had the rash for another month, then... then I'd go away. Look at this! Laplap (pudding-like dish made of various kinds of yam) is ready! - Here you go, Anna. Some Laplap? Anna? - Thanks. It tastes so nice. Can I have some coconut? Some Laplap. Oh! Oh, that's good. - Do you see the Alizee? - Yes. And here I have gone with Jonis and Nickelson. To the other side. Yeah. Go over there! Did any of you happen to pack my white blouse? Finished! Well, I've written down a few things about the toys. They play with things that exist in nature. They catch big moths and make them buzz at the ears. They also catch crabs, which they take for walks on the pasture. Some children have tame parrots. There are actually no toys like in our country, which one owns and guards, and about which one says: "This is mine. You're not allowed to touch it." Instead, they can simply go to a tree, pluck a leaf and braid it. They make their own toys. They're already having fun making them. When it's finished, they often don't pay much attention to it anymore. They often throw it away directly. It's very different here than it is in our country. And they don't have dolls or teddy bears. - You have a new fabric? - Yes. - Nice. You bought in in the store? - Yes. - I got up early today. - You don't have to work? - No. - No? - Yesterday you worked. You made copra (dried coconut meat). - Yes. - I saw you. In the garden over there. - Yeah. - You like it? - Yes. I see the light. You can see it better in the night. What are you doing? I'm making a map of the island and all the gardens. Of your garden. Here is your garden. And here's Simon's garden and all the coconut trees. Can I see the tape recorder? The tape recorder? Yeah, take it! - You know how it works? - Yes. - Yes? I think you know. Michael has one. I've seen you with Michael's. There you can make music. - It's nice music. - Yes? You like it? It's music from India. - Yes? - Yeah. - How much...? - How much did I pay for it? Forty dollars. Forty dollars. - It's very expensive. - Yeah, it's expensive. - Otto! - Yes? I'd like to buy your tape recorder. You want my tape recorder? Do you have enough money? Yes. I make copra and I'd like to buy your tape recorder. - Will you give it to me? - Yes, if I leave... If I go away from the island, then you can have it. - Yes. - Okay. But it's lots of work to make copra for 40 dollars, isn't it? I think it's better to give me shells. - Yes? Okay. - Yes. I would like it. So you know the prices for the shells? - Yes, this one is $1. - And the small one? The small one? If you take 10, it's 40 cents. - Is it good? - Yes, it's good. It's good. So we'll make the deal. When I leave the island, you give me the shells and I give you the tape recorder. - All right? - Yes. It's a good price. How did you come here? Well, from Santo I got a lift up with Jimmy Jones. And that's why it took so long, because he went all around the islands. And this was his last call before going back. But I got a lift up from Epi straight to Santo. It took me, I guess, six days altogether. Did they build this house especially for you? Or was it...? Eh, yes... So, that's the rest of us. Paula. Where's Paula? That's Brian. - Which is which? - Hello. - That's Gin's brother. - Are you Anna or Paula? - Anna. - I'm Paula. Hello. Hi. - How have you come? - With Jimmy Jones. Oh, I see. How long...? Did it take you a long time? Yeah, about a week. I guess I must have missed Gin. - Have you heard about the terrible things that happened? - Yeah. Do you know how long they'll gonna... No, we don't know when she's coming back. We don't know what she's got. We don't know what's happening. Well, I'll wait for, you know, a week, and if we don't hear anything, then... I might disappear. - He could sleep at our place. Yes, you could take her bed. There's enough space. - I won't catch a horrible disease? - A disease? - Come in! - Okay! - We've all got it anyway. - Oh, no. Really? My God! Maybe I should leave. Hello, Michael. I want some batteries for the torch. - I got some batteries here. - Yes. Two pieces. - Thank you. How much does it cost? - 10 cents for one battery. 40 cents. Two. Three. Four. Thank you. I have some questions about the cooperative. Can you help me? Do you have time or do you have to work? - I have time. I can do it. - Yes? That's nice. I want to know: What is the current price of copra? Of one kilo of copra. Now the price for one kilo of copra is 17 cents. - 17 cents? - Yes. And is this a high price or a low price? That's the high price we're having right now. And the lowest price? You know it? What's that? - The lowest price is 11 cents for one kilo. - 11 cents. And how much copra do your people make a year? During the year. I don't know how you... count it. I think you make it every three months. Yes. Do you write it down in a book? - Or how do you make it? - Yes. Can you show me? Let me see it! And what's this? Is this how many tons of copra they make? 2 tons, 989 kilos. Nearly 3 tons of copra. - Yes. - Is this in three months? - Yes. - In three months. So they sell the copra through the cooperative for the current price, which changes continuously. The cooperative purchases and you can buy them in the shop. So they don't really have that much to do with the money. With the actual money in their hands, because they don't know much about money either. They're so easy to rip off. They don't have the right understanding of it. But what do they buy at the store? Did you find out anything about that? I wrote that down. They also made a list of what a family needs, roughly. They told me that each month the man needs a pack of stick tobacco for every day that he works. - That's a lot. - They also need lots of sugar. They need four kilos of sugar per month. You can always see them spooning the sugar. Half the glass is sugar, the rest is tea. Then they need one box of matches. Kerosene. Seven tenths are enough for four days. Soap, rice and biscuits for the kids. Tuna now and then. And batteries for the flashlights. If the ship comes, a beer too. They need about $20 a month. That's 50 Marks. That's sufficient. A family can also use less. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay Vila. Dives Bay here. Talk to us. Over. Roger, Vila. Roger, Vila. Receiving you loud and clear. Would it be possible for me to make a telephone call? Over. Roger, Dives Bay. Tell me the number. Over. Dives Bay Vila. Roger. The number is: 2752. Vila Base Hospital. And I would like to speak to Gin Beatt. G - Golf, I - India, N - November Beatt. B - Bravo, E - Echo, A - Alpha, T - Tango, T - Tango. Gin Beatt. Do you copy? Over. I didn't think he could do it. Dives Bay Vila. Do you copy? Over. Shit. Dives Bay Vila. Do you read? Over. Did you get the number, Vila? Did you get the number? 2752. Over. Got you, Dives Bay. 2752. I'll put you through. Over. Roger, Vila. Dives Bay's standing by. Very easy. Lucky. Yeah, sometimes it takes a couple of minutes for them to put it through. - But it's coming through quite clearly. - I didn't understand it. Good to know. You have to get used to it, because it's quite different from... You know, it's like a different language. It sounds like Bislama to me. I just hope she's still at the hospital. Vila Dives Bay. Your party is on the line. - Go ahead. Over. - Now it's clear. Dives Bay Vila. Roger. Gin, can you hear me? Over. I can hear you. But who is it? Over. It's Brian. I arrived here with Jimmy Jones on his ship about four days after you left. And I was told that you would be back in about a week. So I'm waiting for you. What's up with you and Berta? Over. Oh, it's an absolute horror here. I tell you, I can't walk and my legs are kind of sore. And Berta... we couldn't find out what was going on with her. Every doctor said something different. But she's got a punctured eardrum. I just don't even know if she's able to come back to the island. Because with a hole in her ear, it can get infected so easily again. So they advised us to send her to Nouméa, which we had to do. And I'm just hoping the doctors will tell me what they her from Nouméa. But it doesn't look like I'll be coming back in the next couple of weeks. Please, can you stay until I come back? Over. Yeah, okay. I mean, I don't have anything better to do. I fixed up the transmitter from the Alizée, so we should be able to talk to you. The invalids return! - You have to carry me! - Carry you? I have to be carried everywhere. I can't walk. Have they amputated your feet? - Did they amputate your feet? - Yeah, they just said: "Take them off!" - Hello, everybody! - Hello! Hello, Alfred. Hello, Otto. - You could have stayed longer. - What? You could have stayed longer. Thank you. This is really a nice welcome. - George, this is my brother. - George? - Pleased to meet you. - Brian. - Brian? We met him in Sola and he offered to bring us over here. Oh, yeah! That's Alfred. That's Otto. - This is Marcel. - Hello. You want to lie down first? I can't do this. Nickelson, can you help me? I think you've changed a lot since we got here. - Is that so? - Yes. In what sense? Now, to think that just three weeks ago you said you wanted to see me in the cooking pot. What was that all about? Well, you got on my nerves at first. You kept saying, "Amazing! This is all terrific." It's really not that terrific for me. It's just normal around here. Well, I don't know. With you it was quite the opposite. You thought everything was incredibly shitty. - That's not true either. - That's a bit exaggerated, but you didn't like anything. And then you missed the beautiful architecture. And you badmouthed the people living here. Well, it's true to some extent. It must be said that the church, for example, looks like a barrack. I mean, there's a childlike naivety about it that you can discover and find nice, but still... Yeah, but there are other things here. Somehow you came here with a certain idea, and I have the feeling that you focus on the negative aspects. You start from there and then see if you can find anything positive. Well, it's just one way to get closer to reality. Yes, but sometimes I think it comes from a resignation of yours. Well, I'm much older than you. Yeah, and you were probably a great idealist back in the day. Kind of like you. Which is probably why it bothers me when you're like that. What bothers you about others is often what you carry within yourself. Well, I'm certainly more idealistic than you, but I don't think of it as exaggerated. You know, if you focus on the positive, then you are more likely to have the strength to promote the positive. I think the attitude has an effect too. And if you only want to see the negative, then it also brings out the negative. So are we playing for money or massages? I think we'd better play for money, because I haven't any more strength in my arms. Well, it looks like $72.50. - Another one? - Yeah, okay. I should try and get something back. - It really isn't my day. - Why so? Well, this morning I was sitting there wondering how we're gonna get everybody to do the work that we agreed to come here and do. And I really just don't see how we're ever gonna be able to publish this book. I really don't see this thing. I'm sorry. I feel quite worried about it and depressed. It feels really strange to come here for like six months to do an intensive study of an island, like of every aspect. It remains sort of withdrawn from the essentials or the life, things that are happening in the village. It amazes me that they spend so much time in the house. Now really. All day long in the house. How do they get the material together? How do they expect to really establish any sort of contact with the people? You know, I really don't feel there is any between any of those four people. Just by sticking together with the others, if I spend any amount of time with you or the others, I begin to get more into my other world, being in Germany or whatever. And, you know, just the whole thinking process and the way you talk, and the things you talk about, I really don't find it interesting. I mean, I feel really much better when I'm, you know, in the village with the people, or just sitting around and watching what they do. I feel like really childishly happy and content. And I feel like learning a lot. But I just don't have to think about it. I just feel that I'm in it and not, you know, I don't feel like, when I'm with them, that I'm sitting outside and watching them. I'm going: tick, tick, tick. "Yes, that's very interesting there." Whatever they're doing, like making copra. I feel like... And I don't like to talk about it so much. Because you and I enjoy doing that. We get a kick out of that. And what you did was, instead of trying to make them feel that they were doing you a favour, you know, and getting things out of them, you were basically too honest, you know. And the situation now is that you've alienated them to such a point that... You know, the secret to success in any of these sort of situations is not to always be honest with what you feel about the way people are reacting, but rather to try and charm them into doing things you want them to do. And you've obviously been too honest and, you know, put their backs up. Brother, I give you the food that's lying there in a pile. Today I pay for your child. I pay for your child, and I take it to my child. Today our friendship comes to an end. You pay for my child and I will pay for your child. I also give you food that lies there in a pile. Now is the right time for everyone who has come to join together with these two people in body and spirit. We are all united with Jesus Christ in our lives. So today we all know that our island will be strong when we get married. When I speak to you, I want you to get married. You must get married. You cannot remain unmarried. Because God cannot protect us if we are not married. So I say we must get married and unite with Jesus Christ. Now we are happy. Father Jesus Christ, come to these two and give them strength to get to know you better and help others to do the same. We ask you, Grandfather, to heal these two in the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus, cast out the spirit of Satan that is within them. In the name of Jesus Christ, save them, that they may become good in body and soul. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Be with these two for the rest of their lives. Amen. Once upon a time there was a man and a woman. They had two daughters who were with them at all times. All right. One night they wanted to go out on the reef. Their father said, "When you go out on the reef, don't go where there's something that's not good." And they said, "All right." During the twilight they finished their coconut leaves. Then night falls. The two of them go down to the beach and see that the sea has already sunk. "Now is the time! Let's go!" They light the coconut leaves and go down to the reef. They see many fish sleeping near the reef. They start to catch the fish, and they catch many of them. "Oh! Let's go to the other side." They go to another side and suddenly the one carrying the basket says, "Our fire is about to go out." But they don't care about their fire and keep on catching fish. And then the fire goes out. They both shout: "Oh dear! Now the fire is out." "Where can we get some fire?" And the two of them stand up. Everything is dark. Once their eyes adjust to the darkness, they go to the shore. They walk around and suddenly they see something. It is the head of Qas (devil) that shines as brightly as a fire. "Oh, how nice! We found a fire on the seashore." "Let's go there and light our coconut leaves." The two come to a stone under which Qas sleeps. They hold the coconut leaves to the head of Qas. They blow, but the fire does not ignite. They blow some more, but the coconut leaves do not ignite. They push the coconut leaves strongly against the head of Qas. And suddenly Qas wakes up. He jumps up and shouts: "What's going on here?" "Oh, we thought there was a small fire." "No, that's me." "And you two can't go away anymore. You will stay here." "You two are my wives now." The two girls answer, "No. We're going back." "No, you can't leave. Did you catch any fish?" - "Yes, we caught a lot of fish." - "All right. Then make a fire." They make a fire and fry all the fish. All three wait until the fish are done. Then they eat and eat, but a few fish remain. Then all three of them are tired and want to sleep. They lie down, one girl on the left and one on the right of Qas. He sleeps deeper and deeper. The girls know he sleeps so soundly he doesn't notice anything around him. They cut off two banana stems and place one of them on the left and the other on the right side. "All right! Let's go back to our father now." They both get up and run away. Towards morning Qas is very cold. He wakes up and wants to hold one of the girls. He holds her tight... But what's that? A banana stem. He turns around and wants to hold the other girl, but can't feel her. He holds a banana stem once more. When daylight comes, he realizes, "Oh! You two have deceived me." He jumps up, screams loudly and loses it. He sees a boy coming, and when he reaches him, he asks: "Did you see two girls pass by?" The boy answers: "Yes, I saw them this morning." "At dawn, they went back to their mother." "Oh, you must go and tell those two to come back." The boy goes to the girls' mother and says: "Oh! These two must go back to Qas." But the girls don't want to. Then they take all the shell money they have, put it in a basket and the boy brings it to Qas. He says, "I don't want money. I've got plenty of money on me." The boy goes back to the father and mother and says: "He wants you both back. You have to go back immediately." These two have a pig that's very tame. They have many more pigs, but only one that they had beaten to make it tame. While they go to Qas with all their things, the pig runs after them. Qas says, "Here you are at last!" "Our father said we must go back to you." "That's very good. I'm happy. We'll remain together now." All three sit together and the pig watches them. No, it has never seen this man before. "It's not one of our people." It grunts loudly. Then it does the same to Qas and looks at him rigidly. It stares and stares. Then it grunts again. "Oh! The pig is cross." Now Qas says, "Oh! Your pig is about to eat me." They answer: "No. It is very tame. It does not eat people." But the pig is cross. It's staring in Qas' direction. And he says, "Oh! Your pig wants to eat me." They both say, "The pig is tame and cannot eat you." But the pig is getting more and more cross now. It's getting up now and racing towards Qas. It's chasing Qas up and down, across the field. When Bishop Patteson came to Reef Islands that was when my grandfather William Qasfarong lived, he wanted to show the bishop, that church and custom are compatible. He initiated the bishop into our custom. And so Bishop Pattison was granted the "LAN" degree (chiefly rank). He had five pig teeth on his arms. That's how Bishop Patteson walked through the "nagamal" (men's house), in accordance with the custom of Reef Islands during the time of William Qasfarong. When Bishop Patteson knew everything, he said, "All right." But in the headquarter of the church he was a subordinate of the archbishop. Unfortunately, I can't tell you his name. The archbishop said, "This is not good." When Bishop Patteson returned to Reef Islands, he told William, "I'm so sorry, but I think it's better if you give up your custom and obey only the church." William Qasfarong asked him, "Why should we give up our custom? Bishop Patteson told him, "If you follow your custom and the church, you got two beliefs." The belief of custom and the belief of the church. Therefore, you must give up your custom. Since then we only follow the belief of the church. - So George is the great-grandson of... - William Qastarong. - Right. And he's your father. In the village, he still learned something of the custom. Is he the last in the village to learn from his father and grandfather? Yes, because when our custom, the salgoi, ended, my father was the last to enter the "sung". That was the end of "sung". Accordingly he learned at least a little from William Qasfarong and from Maple, his father, before he passed away. So he still knows a little. We gave up the custom and obeyed only the church. But now you're trying to revive the custom a little, aren't you? Yeah, we want to pick up where we left off. I don't know how many years have passed. Then, at the time when two parties were formed, the Man Party and the National Party, - Vanuaaku? - Yes, Vanuaaku. All right. The Man Party said it was the black man's party. But in the eyes of the National Party. the French are on the side of the Man Party. The Vanuaaku says: "We are the party of the black man." When you say Man Party, do you mean Nagriamel? Yes. Okay. Yes, Nagriamel and Man Party are the same. The Vanuaaku says: "We do not believe that Nagriamel, the Man Party, is independent." "They say they're on the black man's side, but they're lying." "The white men are behind this. The Frenchmen are backing them." I believe that only Vanuaaku is the black man's party. In the first message they sent everywhere in the New Hebrides, they say the following: You must hang on and preserve the customs of your islands. Accordingly, we are thinking of reviving our custom. You understand? For example, it's the same with adoption. Joy Linda, for instance, married Michael. Joy Linda was adopted. And if Michael wasn't adopted, they couldn't get married. Joy Linda has become a Veppdepeqel, while Michael had been a Veppdepeqel since birth. But Michael has now been adopted by Hanson, because Hanson is his father's sister. She adopted him because she is a Kalio. And because Michael is now a Kalio, he can marry Linda. - By the adoption it has been put right again crosswise. - Yes. But I don't really understand the adoption thing yet. I'm not quite sure how it is applied and in what cases it is not done, and whether it is done consciously. When I'm sitting there asking questions, then I realize that it's actually on a completely different level how I ask the questions, while my thoughts are already going in a completely different direction. And I'm trying to establish a system, but I realize that I cannot ask the questions properly. And the language barrier is a difficulty because I have to do it in English. And that it has to be translated. And that the words have a completely different meaning. And that somehow I feel I'm not really getting into it. It's been on my mind a lot. I mean, I don't know how to handle it. I want to understand. And I always say I want to understand. And then Mr Selwyn says, "Oh, black people just have such a complicated relationship." And then it's just so... Well, it's so difficult. And there's something else I'm realizing, too: When he asks questions... He sometimes starts asking questions about us now. For example, he asks about my sister, my parents and their brothers. And then I realize that I have never really thought about myself and about us in the way I'm trying to understand others now. And it's actually very important. So it would probably be better to do it at our place, since I live there. Say, do you know if the individual family clans always live together? It seems to me that everyone at Mr. Selwyn's house belongs together. Yes, it's that the clans don't actually live together like they used to. It used to be much more common. But it's true that on this side lives mainly the clan Veppdeweii, while the clans Kalio and Veppdepeqel in particular live on the other side. And... - Yes. - There also seems to be a division between rich and poor. Yes, I'm not quite sure, but the poorer inhabitants seem to live on this side. And on this side the richer inhabitants seem to live. - The chief lives in the middle. - Yes, right. But I also wanted to say about the clans that Veppdeweii used to be much larger, you know. Kalio was also very large, but recently Veppdepeqel has become very large, because Mafi adopted the sister and they made his clan very big. Are there actually three or five clans now? Well, there are actually three major clans. Kalio is the largest clan. Then comes Veppdeweii. But it is no longer so large, since Veppdepeqel has become larger by adoption. Actually, Veppdepeqel should be the largest clan now. - That should be enough, Gin. - Yes, I think so. - Can you get some firewood? - Yes. Alfred was out with me diving, looking for that shell for him. He got a bit cold, so he was was lying on the canoe, with just his head hanging over the front, you know, with his mask in the water, and he had Robin paddeling him along, you know. So he could just, without being cold, he could look for this shell. And I was swimming along about just a little bit away, and I saw one of those sharks that, you know the..., I don't know what the proper name for them is, but they're not dangerous. They just sleep on the bottom, you know. - "Lazy Sharks". - Yeah. But the people here don't know the difference, right? Anything in there, they're all the same. So anyway, I thought, "I impress Alfred a bit here." So I called him over and I told Robin to put his mask on to look over the side and watch me, you know. Then I... It was about 20 feet deep or something. So I dove down, and it was just lying there and I grabbed hold of its tail, right? And the last time I did it, which is about a week before, it sort of swam off as soon as I grabbed its tail again. So I grabbed its tail and nothing happened. And I shook it and nothing happened, you know. It just lay there, and I would have thought it was dead, but I had seen it move, you know, from the surface. So I shook it again and it still didn't move, you know. So I started swimming up to the surface because I was running out of breath, you know, and I pulled it all the way up to the surface and handed Alfred the tail. You know, it was like, about five feet long or something like this. He wasn't really too keen on holding it. And then I hopped up into the canoe. And I said, "Why don't we tie a rope around its tail and tow it back into the village?" "You know, it would be quite fun to walk into the village holding this live shark." Unfortunately, just then it came with two chips of its tail. Alfred was seized with panic and let it go. It swam away. And as for contact with people, she always reproaches us for staying in the house and having no contact, not understanding that we also participate in village life, but in a different way, not so extroverted. I mean, she came here and after two weeks she got adopted. You understand? She says she wants to get involved with people, but she has no idea what adoption means. And yet, after two weeks, she's adopted. I mean, we just can't do something like that. We just have a more shy nature and take things more slowly. - But she doesn't get that. - This is all very superficial. The outer appearance. She's deluding herself that it is contact when she walks around the village a lot and exchanges smiles and friendly words. But a real interpersonal contact between us and the people here is probably only possible after years anyway, or if you are married here. Moreover, the contact can only be approached very carefully. If she thinks that the contact she makes is good, that's fine by me, but what I can't stand is that I should have the same kind of contact, and that everything I do should be exactly how she imagines it. If I have my own feelings and express them, she thinks it's neurotic. I find it exhausting. The power struggle with her will continue in Europe. There she will also try to push through her ideas about how the book should look like. And in this respect we all have different ideas. But it seems to me that we have more of a common idea than she does. She simply wants to get her way with the book. We'll just have to talk to each other, then it'll work itself out. But if she's not there, it's gonna be hard to get it together. But then we might be stronger as a group. After all, there are four of us. I think that communication in English is already a difficulty. You can't convey all the subtleties, including the psychological aspects among each other. That's quite right. Language is an important aspect. There are often misunderstandings. But on the other hand, she blames so many problems on this language barrier, even though in some cases language does not play a role at all. It has to do with two different views of the world. If we don't understand each other then it's rather on an emotional level. And then she blames it on language. And that's just true up to a certain point. You know, I don't think we should let her dominate us so much. The little bit that she has ahead of us, since she grew up near here, as well as the knowledge of her brother, they took advantage of. But in the meantime we also know our way around here. And I don't think we need to be so restrained anymore. And she doesn't have that much power just because she found the publisher. And because she organizes the whole thing. We just have to resist her. We just have to let it come to a confrontation. Yes, I understand. Well, after four months, I'd rather avoid any confrontation. It's incredibly exhausting for me, and then I don't have a clear head any more. Well, I'd enjoy a little bickering. Yes, but I also find it tedious, because you put so much energy into it. And it would not be necessary. It robs you of everything and then you're exhausted by the constant underlying tensions that are going around. And we already had disputes. And it seemed to make a difference in the short term, but nothing happened in the long run. Yes, nothing really changed. It's just that this thing is getting out of hand because you have to produce something. You have to collect something and then Gin asks you to put it in front of her. "What have you done?" So it's kind of like we're employees of her. That's really an impertinence. - In a sense, so are we. - Exactly, you have to see it that way. What I find difficult is that in the course of six months everyone shows his bad and good sides. And if you were in Germany, you might not spend so much time together. Certainly not. It wouldn't surprise me at all if she opens a training camp for social skills here soon. And we'll all have to sit there like pupils, and then she calls you out: "Well then, Otto, imagine that Atkin is standing there. Go there and establish contact." "Stay relaxed." "By instinct. What would you ask now? How it's going?" "Hello, Atkin. Are you all right?" "It's not right. You have to do it differently." Then she marches there. Oh, Otto! - When it comes to that... - Yeah, we're all going nuts. I'm going diving, Nancy. I banged my head. Okay. Simon told me that you've been running after your mother. What was that about? I chased her with dry leaves, I ran around with them, so there was a very loud noise, and she thought it was Qas. She thought it was the devil? She ran away, and I heard her breasts banging against her stomach. You're being cruel to her. Simon said Mom came running into the house with Lydia. He asked what was going on. But she could not speak because she was completely out of breath. Then she said the devil was chasing her. Here's your nautilus. It's a little cracked, but... Which side are you gonna draw it from? - From the front. - Yeah, that ought to be alright. - Thanks a lot. - Did you just start it this morning? - Have you finished the breadfruit. - Yeah. You want to see it? Do you like it? Are you going to leave that white? - Would you paint it green? - I was just wondering. I just have to finish that leaf. But it's not really... - It's really nice. - Thanks. We left Reef Islands after the big hurricane that had destroyed everything back then. It wrecked our gardens. Everything. Then we left. - So you left because there was nothing left to eat. - Yeah. But why did you come to Ureparapara? We went to Vanua Lava first. We stayed there for a year. - My father was very sick. - Maple. Vanua Lava was not a good place for my father. - Why? - He was always sick. Then we went back to Reef Islands, stayed there for a month and realized that there was not enough food. And then we went down to Ureparapara. - And you find it better here? - Before, but not anymore. - Why? - We miss everything. I mean, we're not as happy as we were before. - Why? - Because we are completely "low". Completely "low"? What do you mean by that? Completely "low" of everything. That makes me unhappy. But I don't understand what you mean by "low". "Low" means something like: You can't live the way you want. You do your work today. You do your work tomorrow. You work for money. You work to make money. You make money to buy food for your family. I mean: the black man has too few things, and there's too much. You get a little money and throw it away. But on Reef Islands...? We used to have nothing on Reef Islands. Nothing at all. We were just happy. You mean, you had nothing like... Like working. Things you do and then feel bad. And when you lived on Reef Islands, you had everything, enough food, your canoes, your houses. And when we wanted something good to eat, we went to the big island, and paid with fish or shell money. The food on Reef Islands is actually not real food, there are only bananas. Can you tell me your feelings about Ureparapara? It's the feeling that this place makes you sick. There are completely open places where you can look into the distance. Everywhere you look, you feel good about something. But Ureparapara is like a suitcase. Look at how it is now. That cloud over there encloses us. You feel like you're not getting enough air. I feel that it's not good for me. When we get into a boat and ride out of this hole, we have the feeling that a load is falling off us. It is so that you feel, to put it this way, that your breath becomes free again. And when you come in here, you're enclosed. It almost feels as if my body is getting heavy. I don't feel well. On Reef Islands, on the other hand, you have a complete view into the distance. Yeah, everything's open there. It's fresh there. You can breathe easily. - Does everyone have that feeling? - Yeah, they all feel the same. Because Jonathan said the same thing when we talked about the boat we're gonna give you. He said, "It's good because we can go back to Reef Islands with it." To plant coconut palms there again and to walk around on the reef. Everyone who comes from Reef Islands feels the same. It's the same with me. Because of these sores on my legs. I'm sick too often. Do you feel the wind blowing now? It's always the same. It gets stuck in here and becomes foul. There's no fresh wind. If you're sick, you know how bad it is, to live on this island. When you're healthy, you feel alright. Is it the same in Lehali or Lequarangle, on the other side? No, in Lehali it is good, because they can look into the distance. - They don't get sick? - They only have the mountain on one side. But here it goes around you wherever you look. There it is enclosed. There's just a small opening over there. So it's no good. I think it will be good if we go to Reef Islands. When we go to Reef Islands, I'll be happy. Hey, take a look! You can see the entire Divers Bay. You can see the village. You didn't think you'd see it so well. The water is incredibly blue. You can't see it from below. This is a great view. Good morning! Good morning! - Good morning. - Did you have a good sleep? - Good morning. - There was no devil? - Good morning, Warren. . It's very wet up here. - Good morning. - Good morning, Paula. - Morning. - Morning, Otto. - Morning. - Good morning. Did you all have a good sleep? - I slept quite well. - Yes? We slept wonderfully. Nancy rubbed our faces with leaves. - You woke up early? - Yes. - So who woke up first? - Warren. - He made all that noise. - He woke up and called Robin. Then they started telling stories, walking around and making more noise. I woke up when I heard the noise... You don't care if others want to sleep. Yes, it was nice. We were up very early. It was especially beautiful before the sun came out. As the sun's rays passed the clouds. The colors were incredibly beautiful. My friends! Are we going down or are we staying a while? We stay on top. To eat. Do you want us to wait for you? No. I think... Well, I'm going down soon anyway. I'm just going to have a biscuit and then I'm going back. - You can't see Reef Islands either. - Yes, take a look. This morning you could still see it quite well. Not anymore. We should try to get the ship soon so we can cross over to Reef Islands. Maybe Brian can take the next ship and get the motorboat. Then we'll get on board and cross over. Do you think it's ready yet? There is a story about a woman who had received from a ghost she saw in a tree a painting with a hat and a mask like from a tamate (devil; ancestral spirit). And she kept it hidden in her house. And when it became known that she was hiding something wonderful, she allowed men to see it for a fee. And when... And after numerous men had seen her secret, they took it away. They built their own house for it, and were taught how to make the masks by the painting, which itself was a ghost. And so the first tamate society was founded, with the strict exclusion of women for all time. Does this story actually exist here in the village? Is that what they tell each other here? Or is it just on the record? Well, I haven't heard it yet. But what really strikes me about these things is that women are often at the beginning of such stories. And they either discover or invent these things. And then the men take it from them. When we were up on the mountain, you see the gap we made, did you see our fire in the night? Where were you? At your house? Is it true or false? Is it true? Didn't you make that big fire near the two breadfruit trees? Is it true? It was the biggest one in the whole village. We saw it from the mountain. Why are you sad? You look a little sad. Why? What makes you sad? What is it? Can't you tell me? I'm also sad... about my necklace. I lost it yesterday. The one with the white pearls, the one you always pulled on. The necklace is gone. I've lost it and I don't know where. Is that a special leaf you take for squeezing? - Yes, it must be a strong leaf. - It doesn't break when yo squeeze it. - Did you already have your food? - Yes, I had breakfast. Why? If you drink this bush medicine, you have to take the plaster off your leg. Really? Why should I take the plaster off? Because bush medicine and European medicine should not be used together. Ok, I'll do it. - Ok. - Well. Ah, it doesn't taste so good. I have to throw the medicine into running water. Is that medicine, too? Are you only collecting medicine now? Is that your specialty now? Let me show you. Watch this. I collected some medicinal plants. I already have about twenty of them. Take this one, for example. I mean, it doesn't look as nice when it's pressed. - But actually, it's fine. - You could put white paper underneath. Then you could see it better. It's not just about it being beautiful either. If I take it back to Germany, maybe they can do a botanical designation. I can't do that. What I do is find out how people here use the plants and what they call them. Take this one, for example. It's quite nice, it has the name of a fish, because the leaf has the shape of a fish that exists here in the water. It's called Weii. - And what do they use them for? - For swelling. You take the leaves, you crush them up and you boil them in a pot. You smear it on the wound and then the swelling goes down. And from most plants you use the leaves. Or you drink them. You're not supposed to do that. With this one, for example, you take the leaves and rub them between your fingers. And it's purple. When it's fresh, it's purple on one side. If you rub it between your fingers, a dark, purple juice comes out. You drip it on the wound and it stops bleeding immediately. And it disinfects as well. I will tell the story in Reef Islands language. A long time ago there were two stones sitting in a volcano that was about to erupt. The volcano is over there. Vittandre and Vitlemoa sit side by side. They sit there and watch the volcano get bigger and bigger. They think that soon the volcano will spit fire and burn them up. Then Vittandre says, "Tomorrow we leave this place." I'm the first to jump. Vitlemoa says, "All right, you go first." "I'll just sit here while you're out and about." "Then I hear when you fall down and there's a loud noise." "I'll know you've arrived, and then I'll jump." Vittandre is jumping away now, that has since been called "he jumps away from the volcano". He jumps and falls down over there again. Before, this island was still together. When Vittandre jumps, from here, and then flies through the air, and hits the ground back there, the island shatters. One part goes in this direction and one in the other. Vittandre has opened the way from the inside out. When Vittandre hits the ground, far from here, it's daylight. Vitlemoa hears him and jumps too. He flies through the air, but doesn't reach the same place as Vittandre because the day has already begun. He falls to the ground next to a stone called "yaenae". Vitlemoa sits over there. That's the end of the story. Vittandre... sits... - Oh, "sits". - Yes. ...hits the ground. - Vit... - Vittandre? Not, Vitlemoa. Ah, Vitlemoa. - ...hears... - "Hears"? Yes. - Hello. - Hello. - Is the ship gone yet? - The battleship? Yes, it left this morning. Didn't you hear the French farewell ceremony? - Ah, that was the farewell ceremony? - Yes. How was yesterday's party? I think they wanted to show us how great they were. They wanted people here to think the French were so good, and give them lots of whisky. And I hear the English are coming next week. Can you imagine? Ninian brought me some island cabbage. We can eat it tonight. - He's still drunk. - Yes. I saw him last night, and his face looked very strange. He somehow snuck aboard and got drunk on whisky. - But John also drank a lot. - Yes. Well, I don't know. But... All the people were standing around and and threw the packages down. I mean... But I'm sure the English will give a party too. If the French do it, the English must do it too. I hope they'll be showing an English movie. At least then I'll understand something. Well, hopefully the film is not similar to the previous one. You know, one of them named Woka came to me and said, "I'm scared." And she was clinging to me like this. That's mean, too. People don't even know the stuff in the movie. They've never seen a train. - And they haven't seen a horse either. - But I think... They saw the gun, but I didn't know if that was the reason. After all, they were always shooting, killing and raping people. I mean, it's absolute nonsense to show something like that. What was that movie called? Eh, "Viva Pancho Villa" [Vámonos con Pancho Villa]. Well, actually, I was just gonna go to the toilet. Before, I thought everyone was "sung": "matwon", "salgoi tamate vevet", "vici n Mei cecüng", "n poipo lap", "n Wu me Ci loe", "n Li wen tamate". I thought every step was "sung". Yes, everyone is "sung". So if you go inside the "matwon", you're "sung". Yes, you have to go inside the "sung" first. "Sung" is not a name for devil, "Sung" is like the place, it's "salgoi". - It's "salgoi" which means taboo. - Yes, this place is "sung". If you want "sung", you have to go inside the "salgoi". Afterwards you pay a devil, the devil you want. So "sung" is the place that is "salgoi". You go inside. Afterwards you pay the devil, you wear him. So you pay a devil, you don't pay "sung". You pay the devil after you go inside? You go inside, you pay a devil. Okay, "salgoi tamate vevet" is the next step. - Does it have plenty of devils or just one? - Plenty. - Does "Vici n Mei" also have plenty? - It also has plenty of them. - And "cecüng" as well? - I has plenty of them, you know. When you show up at a dance as "matwon," when the whole "matwon" appears, that is a different group than "salgoi tamate vevet". When they all appear, they are all different, like if one is "cecüng", "LAN" or "popoi lap", they are different when they all come. The "matwon" must not stand near the others. The "matwon" must appear first, because the others are very high-ranking devils. If you want to go inside the "salgoi tamate vevet", you have to pay every devil of the "matwon". - Everyone? - Yes everyone. - You have to wear everyone's hat? - Everyone's. Okay, "salgoi tamate vevet" means taboo. - "Tamate" in your language means devil. - Yes. "Vevet" is the leaf. Okay. "Vici n Mei". What does "vici" mean? I don't know how to explain it right now. Do you know "natala" (giant clam)? It can be found on the reef. To it we have found the corresponding leaf. I told you it was the leaf that came out of its mouth. Oh yes! You told me. It's the same leaf as this one. No, not that one. Right, that's the one. I saw them while diving. All right. This clam has "vici". It's called "vici n Mei". It's the "bottom". It has a "bottom". When it sits down, it has a "bottom". It has something like a root, which is its power. Ah, power. Ah, root. And what does "n Mei" mean? - "N Mei" is what I already told you. - Leaf. Something like the root of this leaf here, or the power that is in the... - Yes! Yes. Inside the "salgoi"! Okay, I think I got it a little bit now. Okay. Okay, one thing I still don't quite get. Now you talk about paying or wearing the devil. I think you have a different understanding of "devil" than I do. So we want to know what "devil" means to you. Is "tamate" the same as devil? Or does it mean something else? - No. "Tamate" is devil. - It is devil? - Yeah, it is. Okay. Can you explain exactly what "tamate" means to you? "Tamate" is like something that can no longer move. That can't move, that's dead. So that's what we call "tamate". So like something that can't move and is in that place I told you about, "n Li wen tamate", the last one I told you about. Yes, the highest one. Yeah. He's in that place which belongs to the dead, as I told you in the story about the two friends, who went into the "n Li wen tamate". That means "n Li wen tamate" is something like the place of the dead. The "tamate" must be inside the "n Li wen tamate". - Is he the same as a dead man? - A dead man. Yes. A dead man. Inside that place we talked about, peace and love that are dead and can't move, like death. Yes, okay. I understand a bit now. But when you're talking about the hat, I don't understand the connection between the hat and the devil. Can you give me another meaning? Something between "tamate" and hat, is that what you mean? Because sometimes you call him hat and sometimes "tamate", but you also say you pay the "tamate", you pay the devil. If you want to come inside the "nagamal", you must pay the devil. But I don't quite understand whether you mean paying the devil or the hat, or what you mean at all. Can you explain that to me? Paying means you pay the "tamate". "Tamate" is not the hat. The hat is something different. As for the one you're paying, the color belongs to something. Let's say you want "susu", then you pay "susu" for this "tamate". - You pay the color it has. - Ah! You pay the color. After that you get to wear the hat and the color is on top. Yes, you take a hat and put the color on top. All right. There it is, what you paid. You pay this fish. You call it the color that belongs to it. You put it on your hat. On top of the "tamate" you sew together, you put the fish. That's what you pay. The hat is just something you wear. You must pay the "salgoi". So the color that goes with it, that you prepare and put on the hat, it's called "tamate", "salgoi". If you do not pay the color of the fish, you may not eat it. So you must pay. When this fish is caught, you can eat it because you have already paid its color. So that's your "tamate". - So color means devil? - It means devil. - So,"n Mei" means devil? - Yes, that's a devil. It's a devil? Yes, that's your devil now, because I showed you. If you go inside the "salgoi" according to our custom, you pay me now. That means you've paid me. If you pay the color, you pay the devil? Your devil. Well, can you use the color afterwards? You may eat the animal to which the color belongs. And you get to wear the corresponding "tamate". I think I understand a little bit now. Okay. Tonight I dreamed of being in a film and I was an actress and director at the same time. And I had to shoot a scene with Atkin. And I went to the market place and there was a bench, a green bench. Just like the ones next to the subway shafts. With two seats, one on each side, and a big grating in the middle. And this grating had cross stripes. Atkin sat on one side and I sat on the other, and we wanted to prepare this scene. I look through it, but there is always a separation between us. We look at each other through the grating and the words get stuck in my throat. Then I try to get another perspective and take the camera. And I stand on one side of the bench with Atkin behind the grating. On the other side of the bench, I'm behind the grating. It doesn't work that way. Then I try to go to the side of the bench, and there is still that dividing line between us. It's not possible for us to get together in any way. And then I see a Gothic sandstone cathedral at the back of the village. And I'm thinking that I really don't want this for the film. It's such a trait of Western culture and I just don't want it in the movie because I think it doesn't work. It doesn't go with the South Sea fantasy that I have. And then I pause for a moment, but I don't find a solution for either one or the other. I turn around and look in the other direction of the village. Everything is normal there. There are breadfruit trees and palm trees. The sun shines through the leaves and it looks quite nice. I go to the end of the village and discover a path there that I hadn't seen before. I walk along it with the children. We play together and it's quite funny. And at the end of the path I meet a group of people, including white people I have never seen on the island. They also walk around with a group of children. I look over at them, but I notice that they're not looking at me. And I don't really look at them either. And while I'm playing, I watch them very critically to see if they get along better with the natives than I do. I can tell it's some kind of competition. There's a lot of rivalry. And we're getting closer, and I'm torn. I'm still playing, but I'm also watching them very closely. I watch how they treat the natives. We always avoid each other with our eyes. When they look, I look away. And just before we meet, they disappear into the bush. But then I go further along the path. And then I come to a church again, which is enormously high. I'm thinking about going in first. But then I don't, I walk along the side of the church. And through round windows you can look into the cellar vaults. And I'm curious. I go there. I look through and see glass cabinets and shelves. I look more and more closely and see mats and baskets. And there is a canoe in the room. And there is a replica of a palm house. And then I realize that all the things we want to explore and collect have long since been collected in this museum. All this already exists. And I don't know what to think. On the one hand I'm disappointed, but on the other hand I find it quite funny, because we struggle so hard. And then it goes on. Two people are next to me, a girl and a woman. We walk along the path together and arrive at a town. You can recognize it by the fact that there're some barracks, and in every barrack there is a shop. And... we walk towards one of the barracks and it has a shop window. And there's some crazy stuff in there. There's the same stuff in there that's available here. For example, there is a tape recorder and lots of clocks. There is also jewellery and very small miniature houses. We approach the shop window and discover that it is special because it has holes. And you can reach in with your hands. There are gloves, and with these you can reach into the shop window and touch the things you can buy. You almost have it in your hand, but only almost. We reach through the windows and they press the buttons on the devices with their gloves. And they turn up the clocks. They look at one of the miniature houses and lift the ceiling. And you see a lot of contorted rooms in it, as can be seen in some of the newspapers they have here. The floor plan of the house, and inside there's furniture in the European style. And I look inside. It also interests me quite a bit, and fascinates me tremendously. I can see that it's stuffy and cramped. But at the same time I get a strong feeling of homesickness. I want to leave and try to get the others to accompany me, the girl and the woman. But they're so fascinated, they look through the glass, they are like hypnotized and can't be addressed at all. In the shop window they discover their dreams. I have no choice but to walk away. I just go far away. It's like a farewell. And those two stay behind. Oh, "tamate". - Do you like him? - Yes. - Do you look like him? - Yes, it's nice. - Does he come again today? - Yes. What's that, Rosy? What is it? A fish poison. "N vüt". True? - You've already written "n vüt" - "vüt". I forgot the "n". Rosy, you'll fall down. - These are good for eating. - Good for eating? The inside? - Yes. - And the "vüt" here? - It's good for what? It's good for poisoning fish. But before, it had been good for eating. - True? - Yes. - But it's poison. Yes, but before it had been good for eating. And now it's bad. - Why? - Oh, I don't know. Some say the old men and women come and piss on it. - And now it's bad. - Is it true? - Yes. - And now the fish die from it? - Yes. And what's that? Don't you know? - What's that? - It's a "peipei". - What's that, Nancy? - But George told me. - "N kpeikpei". - "N kpeikpei". Not "peipei". - Like this? - "N kpeikpei". N kpei... - ...kpei. - Like this? - Yes. ...kpei. Yes. Good. Like this. - The "tamate", you see, is very nice. - You must show it to Charles. Maybe. - Oh, what's that? - That's a "wuil". And this is a "vülvül". - What? - "N vülvül". Don't you know the word? - Yes. Who told you this word? - George. - "N vülvül". "N vüt". - What? - "N vüt". - This is "n vüt" again. - Yes. - And this? - "N Mei". - "N Mei"? - Yes. And this is used for the "custom" headdress? - Yes. - That's what Daniel told me. So many people! Yeah, we were really worried about you, because we saw the sea was so rough. - Do you have some mail? - No, there was nothing in Sola. We just stopped at Jimmy Jones' place and got some onions and biscuits. - Was it good? - Yes, the weather was a bit rough. - Was the weather good? - No. Rough. - Do you like the boat, Alfred? - It's a very nice boat. Yes? Oh, good. Actually it wasn't so bad all the way up to Gaua. It's just that from Gaua to Sola it has been rough. No, we got your message. You know, they were looking out at the sea today. And it looked so rough out there at the passage. So windy. It's no good. You see, Marcus? Four days. After four days we arrived at Gaua. Very nice. Well played. I think it's very important that we also include our personal experiences in the book. In addition to the scientific facts, we should also write a preface, describing in general terms what has happened to us here, referring to the problems and difficulties. And each individual should write how they experienced this, based on their personal feelings. And in the different chapters we should also always include descriptions from individual people. I find this so important because it reflects the whole complexity. We are different people who describe an island. And that is then shown in different ways. Usually something like this is not actually done in the books. I think it is important to try to somehow combine the scientific and the personal, and create something in between. With scientific books, facts are provided, while with field reports a person describes his or her experiences. And we have the opportunity here to do something special. Well, I... - We break new ground. - God willing. I think we need to meet again and make an exact plan. I would like to write an exposé. So that we have a rough exposé. We should do that. For example, everybody could write a preface. Does that mean we'd have to finish it in advance? No, it doesn't have to be finished. - But it has to be included. - In my case, I'll write a preface. I'll write about my working methods and problems in the preface. And... I would then write an exposé about the stories on "tamate" and the secret society. Is that right? - Secret societies. And about all those "custom" stories and the information I have so far. - I'd pass that on to you. - I mean that everyone writes an exposé about the area he or she has been working on. But that only means a structure. We're not supposed to formulate anything. No, but for example, you write what you have found out about the plants. You write about the medicinal plants and add the corresponding photos. And since you both know quite a lot about the customs, you'll have to get together to clarify who does what. Well, I gotta tell you, I'm gonna finish all my work. And... Yes, I write everything down, add the pictures and number them. And once I've finished it, I'll pass it on to you. And then you can actually do whatever you want with it. Because... I want to go away. I can't stand it in Germany. I sit there and it's just too rigid and repressive for me. And I don't want to get used to that way of life again. Because it's dragging me down. I don't want that. We haven't upset you? Or should I say me? What do you mean? What are you referring to? You? No, this has nothing to do with one or two individuals. - I'm talking about the entire... - The entire population. No, it's the entire way of life. And the processes you have to go through in order to live there in peace without being constantly disturbed by things. After six months here, I just can't take it anymore. I just can't. But you'll still have an address? - I think so. - Where? Do you already know? I don't know. I mean... I believe that I'll be going to America because the way of life is more familiar to me and it is my language. And I understand the kind of humor better. And that's pretty important to me. - Well, I'm a little bit looking forward to going back. - Yes. - I may even look forward to winter. I look forward to working. That's what I'm looking forward to the most. Working in my own way. To have the opportunity again to work quietly. To have your exact place. I feel the same way. I can no longer imagine living without a mosquito net. And without the children. Yeah, I'm gonna have a hard time with that, too. The children. I also think that the longer we are here, the more a feeling of familiarity and security develops. A certain security has also been created. It's become dear to one's heart. But I find that at the same time the feeling of unfamiliarity has become stronger. Both feelings have become stronger. For me, anyway. And I'm conflicted. I look forward to going back, but I'm also very sad about it. I don't mind going back. I'm not so sad. I'm really gonna miss getting up in the morning, leaving the house and going straight to the beach. That was so beautiful in the morning. And in the evening too. - You've always made good use of it. - I went to the beach every morning. I'm going to miss it terribly, because it has become so important to me. Yeah, just to have this natural environment.
