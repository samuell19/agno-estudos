My name is Christy Lam. I'm 29. People say 30 is a threshold for women. But at 29, I have a great job, and a long-term relationship with a boyfriend who still cares. I try my best at everything and plan for the future. Everything is moving in the right direction. Thirty. What's so scary about that? "Mar-05" 6:30am. Wake up, get up, pee. Toothpaste, cleanser, toner. Mirror check. Skin check. Circles got darker, skin got drier! Pore serum, moisture serum, eye serum, whitening serum, eye cream, face cream, base cream. Cheeks, forehead, nose, chin. All over the face. 30 on the left, 30 on the right. SPF 240 Rub and rub and rub. 100%... not ready for work. 6:55am. Time to get dressed. Wore this yesterday, someone wore this the other day. This one's old, this one's ripped. There's a meeting I cannot skip! 3 proposals to prep, 9 reports to write, 16 emails to read, 26 emails to reply. 100 reasons... not to go to work. 7:13am. Time for breakfast. Hi-calcium skim milk. 80 Calories. 40g of plain corn flakes. 228 Calories in total. 70% full. My reward... 1 slice of toast. No butter, no jam. Only 104 Calories. Half liter of plain water. Lingzhi, vitamin E, vitmain C, bilberry, fat burner. Done in 1 minute. Not ready for work at this minute. 7:42am. Time for makeup. Foundation, powder, eyebrows, eyeshadow, blusher, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, lip gloss, perfume. Earrings, necklace, watch, and ring. Check the nails. Check the stockings. 8:02am. I'm so ready for work. Why am I always so rushed? Why does something always come up? Here's life's biggest contradiction. There are many things you want to do, but far more you haven't done and must do. The worst thing is that time seems to only move faster! In no time, it'll be my birthday. In one month's time, I'll be thir... Mr. Leung. Good morning! Why are the elevators always out? Yes. Also, water's coming through my bedroom wall again. All my handbags are wet. Can you send someone to fix it? Sure. Just have it fixed and I'll take the cost from your rent, okay? Okay. I'm in a hurry. Let's talk later. Mr. Leung? Are you alright? I'm fine. I got to the first floor before realizing I'd forgotten my wallet. Just catching my breath before going back up. See you. Okay. Thank you. What luck. Christy Lam? -Mr. Sihn? -Hello! You still remember me? Long time no see. Back then, I was your substitute Econ teacher for a year, right? You look just the same. But you've changed a lot. I only recognized you by your voice. Going to work? I guess so. -What do you do? -Marketing. -Your own business? -No, just an employee. Employee... When in the 90s did you graduate? Ninety... -94. -94! Doesn't that make you 30? Or is it 30 something? -Thereabouts. -Right. I'm so chatty, I nearly forgot my card. Here you go. You're not teaching? No, I work at AYA. Teaching money management beats teaching Econ. Have you invested in any retirement funds? That early? Early? -You married? -No. -Bought a flat? -No. Big trouble! Look, seriously. Women. The older they grow, the less they can get. The curve just drops right down. You've learned it, "the law of demand." But no need to memorize that. It's useless. I mean it. Women especially need to plan for their future. So take my advice and call me. What a coincidence. I happen to have a plan right here. This one for women is very good. It's designed for those who are single, unmarried, or can't marry. You're protected until you're 80. Have a look. I don't mean it's for you, but take one as reference. -Call if you have questions. -Sure. Since I taught you before, you get a 5% discount. -Only from me. -Can I have one? Thank you! Call me. My card's attached. I'd like one, too. Call me. My name is Dickson. Excuse me, I'd like one for my sister. Anyone else want one? -I want one! -Here you go. Look it over. Take your time. Could you pass that to the back? Regarding next month's Diamond Caviar Serum campaign... Jennifer is confirmed for another TV spot... We'll do a big press-launch in April. Ken. The mood board you handed in. What do you think about it? I... tried my best. Well, your best is just not good enough. I'd rather you say you threw it together. You want to work it again or never work again? -I'll do it again. -Good. Another thing, the cologne you've been using. Doesn't suit you. -Iris. -Yes. Anything from the agency? Did they submit the budget? But... the deadline's today. Why is it always so last-minute? Tell them it must be in before the deadline next time. Okay. Work means more than taking orders. That's useless. -Understood. -Understood. It's normal that bosses find workers slow or lacking. Just as I've never heard a boss tell a worker, Wow. Better than I could've done. Elaine may be a bit much to take, but she truly is a smart and capable boss. Especially once you learn that this woman, on her own, built the La Casa brand from nothing, you'd know she should not be taken lightly. Don't you think she looks cool? My heart goes racing even when she yells at me. Can you imagine, that at such a big company, the boss insists on keeping the keys herself to open and lock up. Elaine is always the first to arrive -and the last to leave, -Elaine. which also means -she is indispensable. -Goodbye. I think being a successful boss means your standards for others are ones you've already met yourself. One more thing. I have an announcement to make. Christy will be La Casa's new regional marketing director and sharing some of my workload. Let me remind you, things will move very quickly this year. I hope that each and every one of you -can speed up the pace. Okay? -Okay. Alright, that's all for this morning. What's wrong? You think you're not up to it? Your expression. Seems worried. I'm not. Being a successful woman isn't easy. If you want to be as successful as I am, that's even harder. But I feel you have potential. How old are you? -29 -Good! Saturn Cycle. What does that mean? Never heard of it? It takes Saturn 30 years to orbit around the Sun. When a person reaches this age, they become affected by it. You'll realize the many changes and challenges in life. I think this will be your challenge at 30. Seize this opportunity. The road ahead will be much smoother with my guidance. But you'll have to walk faster. I'll soon be meeting a lot with Jeff Lee, setting up the new office. So this one, I leave to you. She even handed over the keys? Not sure if I should congratulate or pray for you. It's just another added responsibility. Then I hope she doesn't promote me. I wouldn't care if she got mad at me. It's her own company, after all. Oh, I have an herbalist appointment at 5. If she asks, just say I'm meeting a client. Going again? Are you alright? Just taking care of myself. I want to have a baby next year. Oh, do you go to an herbalist regularly? You'd best start taking herbal medicine. I haven't even thought about marriage or kids. Of course I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about your promotion! These keys come with great responsibility. Christy Lam, you're now officially my No. 2 idol. I really like powerful women. Excuse me. Where is Elaine's office? Hello, Jeff? Got it, thank you. Sorry, I'm late. Jeff Lee just spoke to me! He hugged my woman! I'd be his fourth string woman if he wanted me to. I'd change my last name if Elaine wanted me. Christy, come join us. Okay. Forget it. Her love circuits are fried and she doesn't rely on men. Not true. She still needs a man for the merger. Women don't have to depend on men. Have you thought this through? What are you saying? The invites are already out. I mean aren't you marrying too soon. No. I've wanted marriage for a long time. She's saying 6 months with Jason is too short. This time you got it. You can have standards. If you were like her, that would be different. It's not her thinking she can't be picky. It's her guy who knows he can be. Match or no match, she should snap him up. Marry, pop one out, then you're done. I ought to be free again by 35 or 36. Fine, then you better quit smiling. Keep smiling and you'll get more wrinkles. By 36 you won't be attracting any men. No way. Where? Are they worse? Don't worry. I'm doing a great skin firming treatment. -Want to try? -Sure! -I want to try too. -Have you ever done one before? What? I started a course last month that costs over thirty thousand dollars! -Thirty thousand? -Thirty thousand? -You got fooled! -To remove freckles! What freckles? If I was you, I'd spend that on getting my legs extended. Fix yourself up. -Christy's finally here. -I'm sorry that I'm late. -We expected it. -Christy, do you have that serum you mentioned last time? They said my wrinkles got deeper. -Smile. Let's see. -No way. Yes, don't ever smile again. Get surgery. No way! What if my two sons don't recognize me afterwards? They'll think you're the stepmother. All set! Guess who I ran into the other day? -Who? -Who? "Chicken" Sihn! -"Chicken" Sihn? -"Chicken" Sihn? His face looks the same, but now he sells insurance. Pretty lucky, you running into him. Tomato had a crush on him back then. That's why he only remembers you! -Right! -So sweet! Since you're finally here, I can hand out invitations. This is yours. Please mark your calendar. -Congratulations! -Congratulations! Do people handing out invites ever consider who actually likes eating cakes? I do skincare. So, ladies, instead of inserting a cake voucher next time, try giving a paper mask? Using a mask to look pretty for your wedding is easily better than downing a dozen cakes before, no? I have something for you. Oh, thank you! It's the really moisturizing kind. These are what Doris asked for last time. -And these are for Tina. -Thank you. This is the most important one. Diamond caviar serum, formulated for mature skin. Mature skin? That's for you! What does that have to do with us? "Happy birthday to you..." No! No! No! First off, I told myself I wouldn't celebrate any birthday from 30 on. Then you have it written so big. Afraid I'd forget? But we bought you a birthday present. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday! Thank you! It's so big. What is it? Wong Kar-Wai movie poster. It's an autographed copy. I saw it today at a record store. You know me so well. Thank you! So, what do we do about the cake? Maybe we use it to celebrate Christy's birthday next month? That works! Or we use it to celebrate a "happy day." Wouldn't that be better? "Happy every day to me..." Should we be planning the next stop? -Okay. -I'm in. I'm going home to take care of the kids. You don't get thirsty after dinner? Isn't she cold? Getting sick is a pain. Friend of yours? Not yet, but soon. Like I always say, I hit the bars to see, -and to be seen. -And to be seen. Exactly! You can find a husband in these places? She's not here for a husband. Hey, I met Jason in a bar. Did you invite Ho Fai? Does he even know that you're getting married? You think I don't want to marry Ho Fai? You think I don't want to be his wife? I knew you couldn't let go so soon. -6 years... -7 and a half years! He's still headed nowhere. He deserved getting dumped. He deserved it! So you still think about him. I don't! We're 30. How much time do we have left? You girls hurry up and find good ones. I want to be your married bridesmaid. Wait! I'm definitely not next. Christy, when are you and Tsz-Ho getting married? Not so soon. Come on, you're taking longer than me and Ho Fai. Didn't you know? It's hitch or get ditched. Please. Don't work so hard. It never works out for overly capable women. Well, not exactly. Look how incompetent this one is, but she's definitely not going to end well. Come on! Actually, I have something to share. What I want to say is... I'm not... a virgin anymore! -Really? -Really? -Cheers! -Cheers! Have you broken up yet? No! We're still dating, but it doesn't seem like we're a couple. He has a wife? Actually, I don't know. He doesn't talk much. But whenever he wants it, then we'll, you know... Then you're just his sex toy! How long? Around 6 months. Please, don't be so stupid. You're 30, not a little girl anymore! Like Doris said, women don't have much time. Tell him to marry you. You're out of your mind! Do you think everyone's like you? Just marry and be a happy housewife? Tomato is different. She should grab every chance she has. Remember to protect yourself, got it? -Let's have a toast! -I'll drink to that. To a good time! Sun, could you stop at Conduit Road before North Point? Sure. Mr. Yeung is on a business trip again? Yes, he has meetings in Singapore. Known him long? I call him all the time. You okay? Yes... Sometimes it feels hard talking to Tina and them, so I'd rather go home earlier. We all do have different lives, but staying friends for ten-odd years is quite special. You know what? Last week out on the street I saw Doris's Jason holding another woman. Shouldn't you have mentioned it? Of course not. She's getting married, so what's the point? Let's say you have a baby in a few years. That child will mean everything, even more than your husband. So if you ever see my husband with another girl, don't you dare tell me. I'd rather not know. -We are here. -Alright. -Thank you. Bye. -Bye. Ms. Lam, should I wait for you to feed the cat, then take you back? Sure. Thank you, Sun. No problem. Sun, I have some furniture, still quite new. Would you be interested? My place isn't very big, but thank you, Ms. Lam. So why get rid of good furniture? I've been thinking about replacing them. You young people really like tossing things out. Us older types? One pair of shoes... we'd sooner fix them 3 times than throw them out. You're exaggerating, right? I mean it. The other day, the TV broke. The very next day, my son bought a new one, then threw out the old one! Replacing is faster than repairing. People these days don't fix things, eh? Mui, dinner's ready. Ouch! Hello? Hello? When are you coming back for dinner? The fish is getting cold! What? It's already past 11? -Christy? -It's dangerous for a young... Your dad's Alzheimer's is getting worse. He keeps saying to wait for you for dinner. Has he seen the doctor? It's booked. That's how old people are, always babbling. But give him credit. He may have forgotten everything, but not your phone number. Mom, I got promoted. What? So, even more work? Whenever you want some soup, let me know. I'll make some and bring it to your place. That's too much trouble. You're still out? I'm heading home now. Don't you dare take a cab. It's very dangerous. I'm taking the bus. Okay, I have to go. Bye. Okay, bye. Ms. Lam, so what I was saying before, what I really meant was that young people just drop their problems. They feel it's easier than solving them. Right? I guess so. But being a manager means learning how to solve them. -Hello? -Hey. -Made it home? -Just got in. Have you fed Mui? Did she eat? She scratched me. Are you okay? I think you two still can't live together. Living with her never occurred to me. What's wrong? Nothing. Okay, good. -That's all. Get some sleep. -Hey! Did I tell you that Doris is getting married? Didn't she just break up? She's with someone else. So soon? Then you're sure to be her maid of honor. I've done that 3 times already. Exactly. You're so experienced, why not you? They say doing that more than 3 times means you'll never get married. You would want to get married? I gotta go. I got up at 6 this morning, and I have a meeting tomorrow. Good night. Hey, how about we talk a while longer? Sure. How about we take a trip after next month? Sure. How about I get a different car? Sure. How about we spend more time together? Sure. How about we visit Japan? Sure. How about you tell me more about yourself? Sure. How about I go to bed first? Sure. How about we talk more often? Sure. Sure. Sure... Mr. Leung? Ms. Lam, you're finally home. -Been looking for me? -Yes. That seepage you mentioned a couple days ago. I came to see what can be done about it. Great, I haven't had time to deal with it. Okay. Are you sending out wedding invitations? Those aren't mine. Do you want some cake vouchers? I'll give you some. I don't like cakes. That sounds great. My wife really likes those swiss rolls. How have you been lately? Busy? -When am I not? -Busy is good. It's good to stay busy. You've been with Mr. Yeung for a long time, right? Yes. Then it's about time to get married. Once you're married, you can live together. Stop paying rent for two places. It's no good. I haven't considered how to live with someone else. Plus my boyfriend's place is such a mess. I can't stand that. It just takes time. The partitioning in this place is really great. Right here. Wow! That's what you mean. This is bad, really bad. Right. And if it rains, then what? This is awful. You can't live like this. I think it needs some major repairs. It wouldn't be enough. Why don't you just move? You really want me to move out? The thing is... Well, my wife, she ran into a buyer yesterday, and he was so nice. And he made my wife a great offer. So my wife, well, she's nice too. She couldn't resist and sold our flat. -What luck. -So lucky that she even sold your flat. -What? -Yes, and the new owner wants to combine them. You know how my wife is. It's hard to sway her once she agrees to something, right? So now what? So what I wanted to say was would it be a problem if you don't have a month's notice. But that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the seepage. That's trouble. The elevators always break down. More trouble. And this building. Its fengshui is mediocre. Also trouble. How about you live with your boyfriend? I don't want to live together. But it's about time to get married. Even that's not a 3-week process! Of course it's not a 3-week thing. It's a lifelong... Hello? Yes, I told her. I'll be right back. Hong Kong people are always in a rush. I know it's a short notice, but I'm thinking you'll find a place, maybe better than this one. If you can't, I can recommend a leasing agent. And your cake vouchers. You have a lot out here. My wife, she really likes those swiss rolls, so I'll just take a few, okay? When you get married, remember to send an invite! Drinks are here! -Red bean slush. -Awesome! What are you doing? Where's Iris? She went to... To check the sponsor's dress. Which shop? Or is she off to the herbalist again? -I don't know. -Then call and ask her. -He's handsome! -Yes. What are you talking about? Nothing, really. "Nothing" sounded pretty funny. She was saying there's a guy at the noodle shop who's really hot. Yes. He's like a young Stephen Fung! Even younger than Stephen Fung? Joanne, don't you think the A/C in here is too cold? What? But I feel hot. Is she just naturally hot or am I just naturally cold? Or are all the vents only pointing at me? I used to hate things wrapped around my neck, but now I'm worried about catching a cold. How did I always have red bean slushies with them, when now I only drink red date tea? Christy. We got an extra tea set. Do you want it? -What's in it? -French toast. No, thanks. I have crackers. These girls you can't communicate with, the ones on the wrong channel, we have a term for them: Little Jezebels! I want something light-colored. Whatever clothes you use, as long as it looks clean. -Okay. -Also, he's not free on that day. If we want him to do it, he wants more money. -More money? -The makeup artist is a no-go. -Perhaps, we can decide on -We can recalculate the budget. -I think I should be okay. -Actually... -Hello? -We're waiting for you for dinner! Your mother finished cooking a while ago. Dad, I'm in a meeting. Stop calling. I never said I was coming home for dinner. But you said you were! I need to go. -Where were we? -Scheduling conflicts... If that venue won't work, find another! Call them now! Stop telling me it's 9:30! Just have the list ready when I'm back, okay? You shouldn't have come if you're still busy. I have a morning flight anyway. What's that mean? I mean could you not bring your work problems here? Don't you get that I came over without finishing work precisely because you're leaving in the morning? I still have things to do. My team is working overtime, yet I ran over to help my boyfriend pack. You're not helping me pack. You're using my home as your office. I don't mind if you're busy, but you don't have to come show me. I am very busy! But I didn't ask for it! The event was suddenly rescheduled, I'm getting forced from my flat, but my boyfriend doesn't care! I asked you to move in, but you insist on living alone. Okay, fine! I'll handle it myself. You think you can handle everything yourself. So independent! So capable! That's right! I know you don't like that! So I couldn't tell you I got promoted! Well, I had no idea. Congratulations! How about some applause for you? I work hard to earn more money. Because I really can't stand your lifestyle! I'd hoped that once we were married, I could at least afford a maid to tidy the house. I'm real sorry. So all your effort was for money to pay someone to do my housework. So let's not get married. You rejected before anyway. I turned you down because I felt you weren't ready. Your demands are so high, I'd never be ready. Yeung Tsz-Ho, say that one more time. I'm not your underling. Don't give me orders. What about the questions I mentioned before? The dresses are ready... they are ready... Do I always have to push before you get started? "Leaving in the a.m. for 3 weeks." "Let's both cool down. Take care, Tsz-Ho." I'll try to search for it. "Dinner with Tina!" "Fully-booked" Hello? Hey, if I said I needed a place to live within a week, would you know anyone? That urgent? No, I don't. I'm dead. I have to move, but don't have the time. Can I stay with you, just for now? No. Why don't you stay with Tsz-Ho? I can't stand his cat. The landlord actually found me a place. He said it's his nephew's friend's... Well, I'm still thinking it over. Ms. Lam, your change. -Thank you, Sun. -No problem. Need help? No, thanks. I'm okay. Well then, take care. -Bye! -Bye! "Make yourself at home!" "Play all the records you want" -Okay, it's rolling. -Wait! Okay! Hi! Nice to meet you. You don't know me, but I still wanted to say hello. My name is Wong Tin-Lok. You must be Cheung Hon-Ming's uncle's friend. Welcome to my home! Actually, right now, I am so excited! Let me tell you why. I am going on a trip tonight! Guess where I'm headed. Have you listened to "Starting from Zero"? Do you know something called "Sunset in Paris"? Do you remember him? That's right! Tonight, I'm flying out to Paris! I sound like a country bumpkin, don't I. Actually, I did travel when I was younger. Mom and I visited places like Seven Star Crags, Xiangmi Lake, and Sharp Island. But all these places can be reached by bus or rail. So tonight, it'll be my first time going by plane! And I'm traveling on my own! Wait, no. I have him. He's Siu Ming! Hello, I'm Siu Ming! Siu Ming will be going to Paris with me! Anyway, make yourself at home. These apples are for you. And this is the wardrobe. I've made some space for you to store your own stuff. Help yourself. Over here are lots of records and videotapes. And this one is "Sunset in Paris"! The red ones are Leslie Cheung's. The black ones are not. Let me introduce these two. This one's Maggie. This one's Cherry. Please remember to feed them. You must, must remember to feed them. Yes, with these. I hope to meet you once I'm back from Paris! Enjoy your month here, bye! Oh wait. Come here, Cheung Hon-Ming. -Me? -Come on! Be quick! Bye-bye! "Wong Tin-Lok's autobiographical diary I, Wong Tin-Lok, on the 3rd of April, 1975..." Wow, what a coincidence. "Was born at Kwong Wah Hospital. Mom told me dad did not witness my birth because he was busy playing mahjong. Whenever mom brought this up, she got very mad. That is the only thing I know of the day of my birth." "January 28, 2005. Overcast. My First Concert I went to the Coliseum today. The first time I came here was September 20, 1991. That was the first time I saw a concert there." "I remember our group of high school classmates standing way back, holding up our hands, and singing out 'Goodbye, Dreams.' Our school and teachers never asked what our dreams were. At most, they had us write about our aspirations. How are 'dreams' and 'aspirations' any different? In sixth grade, I wrote that I aspired to be the president of a fan club. Teacher said it was not a profession. And told me to write it again. I wonder how many were smart enough to be doing now what they wrote in their aspirations essays then. As for me, I'm 29 this year. I've been a salesperson at a record store for 10 years. Is it time to think about what my dreams are?" Excuse me, do you have the album "Words for My Beloved"? The original vinyl records are out of stock, but I think we have last year's CD remake. Do you want it? Remake? It's by Cecilia Cheung. Hers was a cover. The original singer was Kinko Cheung. All the songs on here are sung by DJs. It's a classic. I don't recognize them. Actually, you'd definitely know the guy doing the monologue. Boss! Hi. The dad from "Sunshine Heartbeat"! -Hello. -Hello. -Can I take a photo with you? -Sure. -I thought you only did TV shows. -Really? Haven't you heard of the movie "The Yuppie Fantasia"? He was Leung Foon. I haven't heard of it. It's okay. Let's take a picture. Could you... -Sure. -This one, right? No, that one. 1, 2, 3. Thank you. Thank you. Let me give this back to you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Hey, boss! Don't be sad! At least she knew you from "Sunshine Heartbeat." Teenagers shouldn't recognize me. Do you know Ho Fei-Fan? -No, who's that? -A famous singer. Famous singer? In Cantonese opera. Boss, can you handle everything once I'm gone? Why couldn't I? You gonna hire someone? No... How are you going to do it yourself? I'll just come watch the place more often. Come to that, when you mentioned leaving, I wanted to celebrate. What? Like it's any good to stay cooped up in here. Of course you should go see the world. I figure it's my fault. I spoiled you and gave you a harbor. Go. Get as far away as you can. I think that, too. When you've gone till you don't know where to go, beg me for a job. I will keep this place up. No matter what. What is it? What's this look for? Gratitude? Hang on. Let's capture that look. My souvenir. I'll put it right here. Thank you, boss. I worked at Dan's for 10 years. Besides being my boss, he is nearly like family. As for my other family member, he is also my best friend in the whole world. He is Cheung Hon-Ming. -Hey! -Ah! You scared me! -Daydreaming? -No. -Need an ambulance? -Hey, why aren't you at work? Got off early. For you. -You bought this? -I made it! -Made? -Made a fool of you! I knew it. Thanks. -Hey, boss. -Check this out. Wow, "Star Wars." -Yes! -For your son? He's not into this kind of thing. It's mine! -Have you eaten? -I'm having rice pudding today. Is that it? You dieting again? This isn't for your lunch, okay? I'm not dieting. I'm just not hungry yet. Just don't. You know last time, when you lost 20 pounds? That put you in the hospital. Scared me to death! That was years ago! As long... as you don't do it again. This is your best look, right now. Cheung Hon-Ming, are you free this Sunday? Depends what's up. What, is it your birthday already? Today's March 3rd. Hey, exactly one more month. Actually, I want to take some pictures. Come with me? So this is why you're on a diet! No! Wait, don't move! It's a "Yes Card" machine! Got a dollar? I love Jimmy Lin! But I only got his card once! Wong Tin-Lok! What's up? Oh, just thinking how lucky we are, running into the old tofu guy. Because who knows if I'll be able to have it again. If you like it, you can go somewhere else. Hey, it's different. His bring back memories. What? Your mom's rice pudding is what I remember best. -Why? -Because whenever I came over, she'd ask if I wanted any. Because I like it, so she'd always make it. If not for her, I wouldn't have had such good rice pudding, and with so many red beans. Obviously she didn't pass that on to me. I can't even cook. You got something else from her. Happiness. Freedom from worry, that's worth a lot. It's easy. I'll show you. Follow my lead. 1, 2, 3. Your turn. -You count. -1, 2, 3. Together. Make the sound. 1, 2, 3. I think it's what I'm best at, smiling at everything first. When you're frustrated, frowning doesn't help. Mom taught me that. Because she loved you. All of us envied you. Who weren't beaten by their dads? That's how I got spoiled. I remember when mom was in the hospital, I didn't even know where she kept the broom at home. And I'd have to visit her every day after school. Uncle, how's my dad? Your dad went to the butcher shop this morning. The floor was slippery. He fell and hit his head. Neighbors called an ambulance. -He's in surgery? -Yes. -Christy. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hi, Alan. -How are you? Hi. What happened? The dress was sent before and she said it's okay. I'm sorry Jennifer has been very busy lately, so she's not in such a good mood. -Okay, understood. -But she'll be fine in a minute! Hello, Jennifer. I'm Christy. I've been in contact with your management. -Where's Elaine? -Elaine is out on business, so I'm handling today's event. So... that's why you're late. Sorry. Do you think I'd wear that dress? We went through your management about it before and they approved it. But I don't want to wear it today. I'm not very happy today. Better cancel the event. There's nothing we can't fix. We've already sent someone to find other dresses. I know... Since it's your company, you can waste your company's time. But my time is valuable. I have a lot of jobs. I shot last night until 4 in the morning. I only had 2 hours of sleep, then a photo shoot, then dance rehearsal. You understand? My time is valuable! I don't save it for you layabouts! It's off! You're not the only one whose time is precious! Ever stop to consider our team? How many nights they pulled for this event? All because you suddenly wanted to reschedule! All because you wanted time off! We personally called every guest here to change the date and time. Right now, my father is at the hospital, having brain surgery! I rushed here to fix problems, not to watch you pitch a fit. I'd say you're the one wasting my time, you witch! There are truly all kinds of people in this world, so you can't expect everyone to do what you want. That's why work isn't about earning money. -It's about earning respect. -Jennifer, I'm so sorry. I remember you always saying that. Would you mind staying for a bit longer? The dresses should be here any minute. Excuse me, the dresses are here. -They're here. -Sorry. Why not try them on first? But some people's respect you may not want. That's when you might feel that work is about paying rent, making a living. Oh, I moved recently. The landlord up and sold my flat. Fortunately, he found me a place to stay for now. Oh right, you haven't even been to my old place. Once you're out, come help me look around, okay? I forgot to bring my cell today. I realized it when I tried to call mom. So I used a pay phone. Only once the money was in did I realize I'd forgotten the home number. Isn't that funny? I know. You'll say I'm careless and forgetful. Mom said you're becoming more forgetful too. I found a bunch of old photos when I was moving. I think I remember some of them, but you might not. Think that's possible? I still remember... your hands were so big. You loved to wrap your hands around mine, and take me everywhere. Honey, do you remember? I used to hold your hands and we'd have milk tea and egg tarts at Wah Nam. Do you remember that time a cockroach ran up my leg? I was so scared! Remember Uncle Kuen? The talkative cashier? He's retired too. You were so young, I bet you don't remember him. I just remember that every Sunday, after finishing milk tea, we'd go to the movies. Those old theaters are all gone now. We'd watch three movies in one day, remember? Every time the gunfire started, you'd be so scared and dump your popcorn everywhere! Then we met your aunt's family at the restaurant. You so love pickled cabbage with pork. I remember. And I'd always have two bowls of rice. That dish was so rich. I still remember how we'd go to Penfold Park on holidays. You would always put your hands in the water. I said don't, the water's dirty. And you never listened. Do you remember how you loved taking the bullet lift at the Sheraton? It scared you, but you had to ride it. We took it ten times, going up and down. Why don't we go there again some time? There's a delicious Shanghainese place in Causeway Bay. You have to go try it. Or would you rather watch a movie? But there aren't any huge theaters around anymore. I haven't gone for a walk with you in a long time. How about you say where you want to go? Dad, in two weeks, it'll be my birthday. It's been ages since we've eaten together on that date. This year, why not go to your favorite, Tai Wing Wah, and have their larded rice? And mom's favorite, 5-spice chicken. Okay? Sure, whatever you like. We'll go on your day off. 623-613 Our old home number, 6 digits. And grandma's home number? 4934-919 7 digits, you remember that, right? 3218-228 to order rice. Your current number, 9734-0906, 8 digits. I remember that too. Do you think it's a lot of pressure? I just need some time to sort out my future. I thought you knew what you wanted? I thought so too. You did very well. Really. If you relaxed a little, you'd do even better. Elaine, can I ask you something? Do you feel you know what the point of life is? Success? Is it that success brings happiness? Success is only a result. When I was young, my grades were terrible because I always skipped out to play. Then when grades were handed out, those who studied hard often panicked. On the contrary, I was the most relaxed one, because I knew there was no way mine were good. Then at 18, since I was dating this guy, I didn't care what my parents said. I took off to Spain with him. At the time, I thought I was already showing my best side... Who would've thought that suddenly that wasn't what I really wanted. So you choose work over relationships? You're right. It's a choice. Everyone has their own priorities. When there is a choice, there is a price. Most importantly, is that once you've chosen, do you put your all into following up. I understand, but sometimes you're so busy you forget what you first wanted. I'm the kind of woman who puts everything into whatever I do. If I try my best, I won't regret or complain, whatever the outcome. That makes life both happier and simpler. People don't realize until they're much older that experience is actually a good thing. I didn't return to Hong Kong until I was 30. It was only through that decision that La Casa exists. Let me tell you, my second Saturn Cycle is coming. I'm still going through all kinds of experiences. But from the first cycle to this one, I haven't regretted a thing. Christy, I won't ask you to stay. Because it's your own choice. The work you still have, The work you still have, I will find someone to pick up, okay? Okay. All my life, I thought I was independent. Until dad was gone, mom has moved back to China, stops calling so often, my boyfriend takes a trip and isn't beside me, and I quit my job. Then I realize I was always very dependent. I always depended on work, depended on eating with friends after work, depended on sleep when there was nothing else. Once you realize there's nothing to do, you really won't know what to do with yourself. Or maybe I just don't know how to be alone? Wong Tin-Lok. When you're home alone, what things would you do? Write your diary, eat apples, take pictures, or talk to yourself? What is it you do when you're alone? February 14th, 2005. Clear skies. Good morning, Cherry! You've been living with Maggie for so long. Are you two even friends? Will you eventually develop feelings? Gosh! It's Valentine's Day today! How about I tell you about my first love? It's so romantic! "My First Love" "I was in eighth grade. I had to take the train to school every morning. It was here, on this platform, that we first met. The first time I saw him, he was wearing a green school jacket, holding a Chinese textbook. I remember, I fell in love with him at first sight! Because he looked like the first guy I ever idolized... Cheung... Kwok-Keung! At 6:58am every morning, he would stand at the same spot and wait for the train. But back then, I didn't have had the guts to go say hi. So I'd stare at him from afar. That's why I remember how he looked from behind..." Wait. Excuse me, were you a student at Wah Yan? Yes. Have you lived in Fo Tan since you were a kid? And in high school, I mean, in tenth grade, you started carrying a dark blue Le Sportsac backpack? Around 6:58am every morning, you'd come from the third escalator and wait here for the train. But you changed schools in twelfth grade, and so stopped taking the train to school. Yes. What is it? Cheung Kwok-Keung! It's really you! I don't mean anything. It's just that I recognized you. The first time I saw you was December 5th, 1988. It was a Monday! After that, I'd see you waiting here every morning, and I was never late for school again. You still remember things from ten-odd years ago? Because I like... to write in my diary. Yes, that's why I remember. Could we take a photo together? I think... I'd better not. Oh. No problem. Actually, just seeing him here again today, makes me feel so happy, like it was fate. I still remember back in twelfth grade, I heard this song on the radio one day. I felt like Wong Ka-Kui wrote it just for me! "Every happy morning" "in this train we meet again" "Embracing your flower-like fragrance" "Never want to wake up from this dream" "Through the reflection of the window" "my eyes could linger around you again" "How frustrated that you don't know" "I'm staring into thousands of tales" "May we never part" "I pray that this journey never ends" "May we never part" "still I imagine one day, I'll be your destination" "And you'll lean on my arms" "The whistle of the train" "sounds like soft singing next to my ears..." Hi. Silly girl. Smells good, are you cooking? This place is pretty cute. Wow. That's perseverance, sticking each one on like that. That you could find such a place... It's got a great feel. Wow, so many old records. Is the owner an old-timer? Let's see... Wow, Beyond! Back then they had 5 members. Remember? This guy left first, Lau Sek-Ming. Lau Chi-Yuen. Then who's Lau Sek-Ming? Oh! Oh! "Tumor Lau"! Wow, Leon. Awesome. We have this one too. We bought it together. Yes, but I threw them all out when I moved. Remember how you would mimic his singing? Yes, so dumb. Wow, another classic! You got off your flight late last night? Didn't get out until midnight. I called, but it didn't ring. The battery ran out. Then why didn't you call? That's why I called first thing this morning. What's wrong? Wow, the whole JSG collection. These are hard to find. So, you've been well? Pretty good. Oh, mom wants to do dinner Sunday. Can you make it? Should be able to. I didn't tell you I quit my job, right? You did? But you were just promoted. It's... I just needed a break. Okay. Polygram... Oh right, how was your trip? How do you mean? How was your Shanghai trip? These trips are the same every time. The only word to use is "boring." How boring? Going with bosses to party every night at Xintiandi. I don't even drink. I just sat there. What else? There's nothing to do in Shanghai, so I stayed in the hotel and watched TV. Tell me more about it. There's nothing special. Even so, you can still say a little. But there's nothing special! What is it you want me to say? Just ask me straight. I just wanted to listen. If you don't have anything, you could ask me. A lot of things can happen in 3 weeks. If you have something to say, then say it. It's New Year's Eve, I cancel everything to be with you, and you're giving me that look? You cried for an hour already. Doesn't that get stale? If not, you're at least thirsty. Drink. It's already opened. Really, breaking up is no big deal. We should look forward. Leave behind all things unhappy in 1993. Then welcome 1994 with joy. Hey! Drink up, jeez. Are you really that hurt? Hurts like hell! How bad? It's not even your first love. Yes it is! But it's normal, You're only 17. You have plenty of time. I planned to get married at 23! What's the point in marrying that early? I didn't say it, he did. He said he'd work a year after college, then we'd marry. He's gone two weeks, then sent a letter with two words, "Let's break"! I told you a million times, you can't trust a man's word, let alone a boy's. Do you still remember that night in Lan Kwai Fong? He's not coming back, so don't be this way. Look at yourself in the mirror. Seriously? No, what I'm saying is look in the mirror. See that face? It's not ugly, and as a person, you're not half-bad. And you've got a great figure. Don't worry no one will want you! Have you forgotten what Leon told you? What did Leon say? Dear Christy, you should know, one loss isn't losing forever. So... you should keep going. Be happy! Be happy! Finally, a smile! I've been trying the whole night and you're finally smiling! Hey, can you... sing your award-winning song again? No, everyone's looking. -Please. -Alright, alright... Let me grab my mic. "I fear I'll upset you if I get too close" "But I also fear my heart won't rest" "So I'm leaving you for good" They're counting down! "All through my life" "Who was the most beautiful of all?" "The you I remember" Do you still remember that night in Lan Kwai Fong? I do. It's been a long time since we talked like such fools. Yes. Do you believe in women's intuition? Why do you ask? Those 3 weeks in Shanghai. Did you miss me? I did. I missed you a lot. Be honest. Did you go to Shanghai? I'm sorry. Hey, I still hadn't told you, my dad passed away. 10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! Happy New Year! If life let you choose the moment, which would you pick to try again? "March 3, 2005. Thursday. Clear skies. I didn't really know what to write when I started this autobiography. My life hasn't seen anything special, except that in a month I'll be 30. I remember, before mom passed, she kept saying how worried she was. Saying that I should be married at my age, that my job doesn't seem to have a future. Back then, of course it felt like nagging. You think I don't want a job that pays well? No one to date, you think that's on purpose? But sometimes, I'd really feel like I had nothing. Have you ever felt like you had nothing? That's why I started writing everything down, no matter how big or small it might be. These are 'My Achievements'! Back in third grade, I got a 98 for a Chinese test. That was the highest score I ever got in my life. This 'Night of Fireworks' from fifth grade art class, was put up in class by the teacher! I once used my red pocket money to buy Leslie Cheung's three 'Stand Up' records, even though we didn't have a player at that time. I remember when I was in seventh grade... I've never felt like I had nothing. Because I spent every minute being the best me. I felt everything had to be under my control. But for some reason, at this stage, it feels like I'm on a ladder. Miss a step, and I'll fall into the unknown. It's scary. Have you ever had tears come out, roll past your cheeks, your chin, drop to your chest, then onto the ground? I doubt you've experienced that. Because you seem like a girl who hates to cry. I thought I wouldn't fear being alone, but it actually scares me a lot. Wong Tin-Lok, why are you so happy all the time? Why keep looking back? Of course, memories are beautiful, but aren't people supposed to keep looking forward? What is it you see? Cheung Hon-Ming. Don't people always say "Stand up when you're 30"? Why "stand up"? I don't know. I think it should be "Lie down at 30." "Lie down"? Because most people, when they reach 30, will lie down for a physical. Hey! What's with you? What do you mean? Where's your glasses? You said you couldn't see without glasses. Wong Tin-Lok! Barbecued pork. It's "an apple a day," but that doesn't mean one apple a day is enough. Wow... The Eiffel Tower... Nice job. What's today's date? The tenth. March 10, 2005? -What's up? -You're Cheung Hon-Ming? No, I'm Leslie Cheung. Is that teddy for me? -How did you know? -So is it for me? Take it if you want. Do you have an uncle Leung? Who has a tenant looking for a month's housing? Haven't heard that... Why do you know? Because that girl's gonna stay here! Also, I told Cheung Hon-Ming I quit my job, then will go travel. You quit? So sudden? Uncle Dan was okay with that? Dan, right! The Wanchai record store owner! I met him when I bought the movie poster! Wong Tin-Lok... what's wrong with you today? Then I decided to tell Cheung Hon-Ming I have... What? I have cancer. Stage 3 breast cancer. So Wong Tin-Lok has cancer. Are you serious? Yes... I came across a report. Pretty unexpected, right? I thought so, too! Hey! Don't just stare at me like that. I've already accepted it. I was just informing you. Cheung Hon-Ming, you've always said, I can't take care of myself, can't plan for myself. I always thought I didn't want much. Just like that, it's been 10 years in that job. Actually, I would've kept working. Until I had a physical and got my report. I think my reaction was worse than yours now. Then I walked alone to Kowloon Park and sat. Sat the whole day. Then it came to me. There are a lot of things that, unless you're forced, you won't plan in earnest for, or ask yourself what it is you want. So I gathered my courage and quit my job. First off, I'm going to travel! Paris. It's "Sunset in Paris!" Finally, after talking about it since eighth grade. And I even got discount plane tickets. I'm leaving next Thursday. So soon? -All by yourself? -Yes! Traveling solo is also one of my dreams. Why don't I ask Siu Ming to go with you? What? Siu Ming! -What is this? -He speaks French! Siu Ming! "Bonjour"! And he knows Chinese kung-fu, so he can protect you. He grew up with me. Bring him along. Wow, aren't you the lucky one. You get to go to Paris as soon as you arrive. I've waited over 10 years! Wong Tin-Lok. Is there anything I can help you with? Everything's set. Oh wait, you can help me look after the two turtles. -Cherry and Maggie? -Yes! Sure. If someone could rent this place a week or two, help with the rent, that would be good. I'll keep an eye out for you. Cheung Hon-Ming, how long have we known each other? Since we were 7. You tell me. So are we good friends? So corny. Then I know how you can help. Could you... touch my breasts? Because once I'm back from Paris, I'd need surgery soon. They might need to be removed. I don't want Dr. Lam to be the only one to have touched me before my surgery. Right now? Sure. Does that feel good? It feels good to me too. Am I lame? All grown up, and never been touched. Don't be silly. I've never been touched either. Really! You haven't been touched either? What's so strange about that? -What are you doing? -Touching you! -Aw, hey. -Touch him, Siu Ming! Maggie's calling for me. Cheung Hon-Ming, how about we make love. Right now? Sure. I'm not going to do it with you now. How about after you get better? Go have fun, lots of fun. But promise me, you'll definitely come back. I'll see you through it. You will get through it. I'll wait for you. Cheung Hon-Ming, remember when we were young, after seeing the "Sunset in Paris" music drama, I'd always talk about coming here. I dreamt that someday I could be like Leslie, walking the streets with baguettes in hand. I'm finally here! I've finally fulfilled one of my wishes. I even got to see the real Eiffel Tower. I bet you can't even imagine my reaction. It took two weeks since arriving before I realized how big the world is. So I went with Siu Ming to many different places, and discovered sceneries I have never seen before. There are places so beautiful, you can't imagine. April 3rd is my 30th birthday. The minute I got that report, I said to myself. No matter how old you are, your life is counting down day by day. However much time you have left, keep doing things you want to do, and going places you want to go, and most important of all, remember every positive thing that has happened to you. Because there are many things we can't control. So the one thing we can control, is how we see them. Missing you in Paris, Wong Tin-Lok. Hello, Wong Tin-Lok. My name is Christy Lam. I wanted to let you know that today is also my 30th birthday. Besides wishing you a happy birthday, I also wanted to say... thank you. Because you made me remember a lot of basics. And... I truly saw your... "Eiffel Tower." "Memories" "Going through my mind a thousand times" "Starting from zero" "They bring tears to my eyes" "Remembering" "All the joy and anger, none shaken off" "No regrets, I must keep moving forward" "Knowing you in this sea of faces" "Can't do without all the laughter and worries" "Can't do without unaffected sincerity" "And honesty" "All because of you, and all your blessings" "Will you remember me" "If I must now depart" "A short farewell" "to rediscover that spark to sprint" "Someday I will let go of it all" "And look for those golden memories" "Even with a heavy heart now" "Will you remember me" Excuse me, I'd like to have that poster. "In the Mood for Love" autographed poster? $600. $600, autographed "In the Mood for Love" poster. -Please wait. -Thanks. "Someday we'll meet again" "And we shall keep that same old smile" -Thank you! -Thank you. Bye! March 3, 2005. Thursday, clear skies. I've made up my mind. Driver! Someone's trying to get on! Thank you. What luck. "Can't do without unaffected sincerity" "And honesty" "All because of you, and all your blessings" "Will you remember me" "If I must now depart" Excuse me, may I know if you're from Hong Kong? I recognize you! Did you buy a poster from a record store in Wan Chai? Yes, I recognize you, too. What a coincidence! It's my birthday today. Would you take a picture with me and my friend Siu Ming? -This is Siu Ming? -Yes! "Bonjour"! Hello. Shall we? -Happy birthday. -Thank you. "And we shall keep that same old smile" "Give me that passionate look" "A thousand times" "Will you remember me" "Step out." "If you love me, please allow me to try this once" Airport Express station, please. Airport Express. -Yes. -Okay. -Where are you off to? -Paris! -Wow, Paris! -Yep! "I hope you'll say "don't change"" "Never change" "Every stage begins at zero." "Heartfelt thanks to all the cast, crew," "and audience of the stage production of "29+1." "It was the nourishment you gave" "that helped the story grow."
