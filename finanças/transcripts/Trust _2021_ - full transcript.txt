Right there. Fuck! I missed you. I missed you, too. You okay? Yeah, why? Are you? I thought you were gonna be there all night. I'm sorry. - Good night. - No, no, no, no. Owen, I'm sleeping now. - But I'm awake. - Mm-mmm. Does this guy not get the concept of the difference between time zones of countries? He's here. All of them. You've been with all of them? Yeah, they asked me to. Well, some of the married ones demanded more than asked. Is that moral? I don't know. The question never came up. Why? Do you model? This is the poor Irish orphan we paid to fly over? So it's all about the sex, then? I only paint those women that are particularly special to me. It's intimate. Sexual? Yes, but... It's more than that. It's that exact moment of ultimate connection that's captured forever in paint. Oh, boy. Hey, we done here? Diana. We're not doing personal questions. It seems like the personal is a process. Oh... She has a point. Look, Brooke, he's brilliant. But as your friend, I'm calling it. The other critics will tear this apart. Did you keep your day job at Sotheby's? Picasso, Klimt, Lucian Freud, they were all called pornographers. Look, I know what I believe in, and if the critics don't understand us, then they're wrong. Hi, can I look at a few? Awesome. This is still for the cover, right? Yeah. So, um, you're the husband? Yeah, hi, Owen Shore. Welcome. She's badass, right? I like that. Yeah, I like the tighter shots a lot. You wanna... Can you reel back to the tighter ones? Honey. We don't want to be late. Ooh, see, when women get absorbed in me... Can't talk to them. Right. To Brooke's amazing new gallery - and successful opening. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, and to make getting to retire early and fulfil my life's purpose as a trophy husband. Mm, let's not jinx it. Hey, if that's what you want, then you should do a news story on it. The feel good holiday piece days before Christmas. - It's local news. - No, no, no. Owen has already done so much. Oh, come on. Isn't going broke and betting the farm what all good husbands do? Hey, Brooke is living her dream, and dreams are worth the risk. Okay, when's our next vacation? - That's my dream. - Oh, yeah. I was thinking Paris, but just me and Brooke. So sorry, guys. Paris in the winter? Text us pictures if your thumbs don't freeze off. You know, I've always wanted to do Christmas in Paris. Hello. I can't even think of a vacation until this gallery opens Friday. Well, I mean, we should plan it soon before things get too complicated. What does that mean? Just, you know, whatever, life. - Owen... - Complicated. - Are you guys pregnant? - No. 'Cause that would be like a shitty way to tell us. No, the doctor says that if we take the pressure off, it may happen naturally. What? We don't have to talk about this. Is that the brooding hunk? Can't be. I left my phone at home. No, it's, um, Brooke's new Irish artist, Hottie McHotterson. Okay, his name is Ansgar Doyle. He was a street artist in Dublin until a few years ago, but hasn't broken here yet. Wait until you see the art. - Hot. - Ooh. This guy, he's always texting at 3:00 a.m. with a crisis. What's the crisis? He can't find his paintbrush? No, he's an artist. They don't sleep. Actually, I learned from his interview that this is an artist who's not sleeping in a lot of married women's beds. - Ooh. - That's not what he was saying. Actually, that's kind of exactly what he was saying. Well, as the two divorce attorneys at the table, I would just like to say that men like Ansgar are very good for our business. Absolutely, core to our business. When you've been doing what we've been doing for long enough, you just conclude that everybody cheats. Although, the wives are just better at not getting caught. Yeah, I mean, I've been hiring so many private investigators I could teach a course at Quantico. I'll be right back. Where'd those come from? Uh... They're from you. Mm, thank you. They're beautiful. Hey, I'm gonna make it up to you. I'm so sorry I've been so busy and so bitchy. You've been so great. Okay, listen. I wasn't kidding about what I said at dinner about Paris. If you play your cards right, you open the gallery on Friday, and we drink champagne all night to celebrate. We get in the air on Saturday on our way to Paris, France, where we spend Christmas next week, French kissing, a little menage a deux. No, wait. Now how about this place to let it happen naturally? - No. - Right? It sounds heavenly, but I can't go then. We don't even have any Christmas plans to break. Look around, we haven't even had time to decorate. I know but I have so much to do after Friday night. I mean, that's when the real selling starts. And I've got more press lined up for Ansgar, too. I can't leave him alone. He needs me. You know what I mean. Let me earn the vacation with sales. That way we can relax and we can enjoy it. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Okay. I'm gonna go take the trash out and work. All right. - Left my phone up here. - Yeah. You, uh, don't wanna miss any text messages from Sarah. Is that one of the new producers? Yeah. Thanks. My opening is in four days, and these light fixtures were custom ordered three months ago. I got to replace the pipe that goes down to the basement. It's gonna cost about three grand. What? Hang on. Tell him to bring me the lights himself. Thank you. Why were you talking to Amanda Gysler? I was taken for lunch. She's interested in me. She has a gallery full of artists who showed potential ten years ago. She should be taking them out to lunch. Wow. I think you're jealous. I think we have a contract. Oh. Jacob, there's no more money. Figure it out. Okay, you'll be able to pay him soon enough. Told you I have news. You may fall in love with me when I tell ya. That good, huh? I have one. You have who? A customer. The big one we need. Damien Light. What... Damien Light is here? No, he's in Paris. He's shooting his next movie there, but he saw one of my pieces in Marais and he likes it. He wants to see more. His people want us there for dinner the day after tomorrow. Wait, where? The hotel at the Marais. Oh, the Marias in Paris? Yeah. Look, we can leave tomorrow, still make it back in time for the opening. You should really answer my texts. Do you see this gallery? I can't go. Oh, whoa, whoa. I need you there. I'm no good at the business. I hate that shite. If this is real, this could be huge for us. Oh, you think I'm making it up to steal away with you? I'm going either way. I'll try to make it back for my opening on Friday night. Very funny. Oh, you need to check in with the husband first. - Um... - Are you more afraid? To leave this mess? To leave your husband alone... What? Or let me leave without you? - Oh, God. - I know. - I mean... - I have to go. You have to go. It's Paris. It's work. Right, it's work. Oh, God, what do I tell Owen? In person's good. Um, run in, bring a coffee, and just tell him you have the business opportunity of a lifetime. Right. Just be direct. Right. Downplay the fact that you're gonna be in a Paris hotel with the world's sexiest man alive. Okay, get out of here. Go talk to her husband before have to represent you. Hope I'm not interrupting. - Hey. - I thought you could use this. Brooke. Hey. Hey, that's so sweet of you. Uh, this is Kim, one of our new producers. - Hi. - Hi. Are you Sarah? - Natalia, new intern. Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? Well, you know... What's going on? Everything okay? Well, I, uh... I have a situation with Ansgar. What now? It's a long story. Um, but it's actually amazing. Damien Light is interested in buying a few of his paintings. That's big news. I know, I know. I know and I would send him alone tomorrow, but things could get... He's not a people person and making the sale could be huge. It could really make all this hard work pay off. This... this is amazing. Yeah. So I'll be back from Paris in, like, two days. Yay! What's that? I said, "Yay!" You're going to Paris? Yeah, Damien's filming there. You're telling me that you want to go to Paris with Ansgar, the myth-of-fidelity guy, tomorrow, after you told me that we can't go on Saturday? I know, I know, but it's business. And I would take you with me, but it's gonna be all meetings. And then, I have to fly right back for the opening Friday and... Owen. Owen, please don't be that way. So does this mean I'm definitely free on Saturday since we're not going to Paris? Well, yeah, I... Yeah. Hey, Kim, is that shoot for the New Yorker's Christmas in Las Vegas still available for Saturday? I was going to give it to Jim, but it's yours if you can do it now. Yes, I am available. Let's book that. Thank you for the coffee. I gotta get back to work. Natalia, see if you can book Owen's flight with seats near us. Vegas, baby. Shit. This has been Owen Shore with the news you can use. Have a great one, everybody. Owen, I feel bad we keep missing each other. Not sure if you're getting my texts. Uh, my flight is tonight. So, uh, when you get a break, please call me. Bye. - Hi. - Hey. That assignment was late last night. What was the story? Yeah, I didn't want to wake you up. I'm trying to get these two new producers to put me on hard news stories instead of these dopey features. Kim's the one you're going to Vegas with. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I just wanted our first time in Paris to be together and Christmas there, away from all this stress, it just seemed like exactly what the doctor ordered. I'm sorry I got so upset. I'm sorry, too. It's just such a huge break. I wouldn't be going otherwise. Come here. You know, I can't help but want you to be happy even if I don't trust that guy. Hey, you only have to trust me. And seriously, I look forward to a getaway of just us without the pressure of trying. I really, really, really do. Well, you know, we don't have to get away... to start trying without trying. I can't. I have to pack. My car's coming in an hour. In case there's a gym I can work out in. Alone. I need you to be understanding here. So no send-off sex? I wish I'd just let it go. 'Cause now I have to be more worried about it. Come on. You guys have been together since high school. No way Brooke would cheat on you. Sometimes I wonder if she stopped being interested in me. Are we in the Goop podcast right now? Am I Gwyneth? - Another greyhound, hon? - Hmm. What? No. Are you trying to get me in trouble? You said just one. I'm sorry. Cancel that, please. We gotta go. Fuck that needy orphan artist. If I want to get drunk to forget him, I'm gonna drink. You forgetting the last time you got drunk? You tried to find a home for every homeless guy in New York. - I don't remember that. - Yeah, exactly. Come on. Let's go. What? Come on. Just one more. No, I gotta go. I'm pretty sure Eleanor put a tracking app on my phone. Hi, there. Wait a minute. I know who you are. You're Owen Shore. It's possible. You're pretty good. You mean pretty great. My friend's gonna die when she gets here. We're studying journalism at Columbia. Nice. You said in an interview once that it's a reporter's job to expose without shaming. Wow. You're good. I used it in a media ethics paper on microaggression. - I'm flattered. - I refuted it. Shame is a useful tool. Maybe you're too nice. I do love your reporting. I was actually just saying how refreshing it is that your stories are funny. They're not supposed to be funny. Mm, you did that one about the guy who marries dogs at a chapel? Ah, yes. That was a fine moment in broadcast journalism. Are you guys together? You mean together? No, but he has been hitting on me all night. - I can't help myself. - My wife's out of town. He thought he had a window. Hmm. I think your choices are superb. And if you want the smaller one, Fiona #3 to give as a Christmas gift as well. Right? So that is five paintings in all and, uh... $152,000. Perfect. Plus, we have your permission to use Damien's name confidentially with the list of collectors that you've approved? To Damien Light. Please tell him how grateful we are for his patronage. Well, on behalf of Mr. Light, we are proud to be the first to champion the work of Ansgar Doyle. Sante. Enjoy the moment. Paris is a wonderful place to celebrate this time of year. We will. Sante. You're not leaving, are you? My friend has to meet you. Yeah, no, I gotta get going, too. That's a shame. Uh, maybe I could get an autograph before you go? Yeah. Okay. To... Amy's fine. To Amy Fine. I guess that's better for TV than... Wait. Um, could you take a picture of us? Is that okay, Mr. Shore? Of course, yes. Thank you. - Thank you. - Nice to see you smile. Oh, my God. That's my new profile pic right there. - Okay, we gotta go. Uber's here. - Nice to meet you. Wait, You can't leave. You have to stay and meet Brianna. Please? I don't know. You don't know? I mean, I could probably finish the calamari. Hmm, uh, you probably have to go because of that thing you were telling me about, remember? Why don't you both stay? Sorry. Do you mind me asking how old you are? How old are you? Okay, I'm out. I'm kidding. I'm gonna wait for Brianna. Didn't know I had a fan club. Dude. Okay, if he brings up the forgotten homeless crisis, cut him off. So they have my favorite martini here. Have you ever had a monkey martini? Okay. One monkey while we wait for your friend, then I gotta get home. I thought you said your wife was out of town. I'll be right back. Ladies room. Okay. Order us two monkeys. I really wanna ask your advice on where to send my reel. Two money martinis, then? Actually, the check. I should go home. Listen, you were amazing with them. The way you told my life story, only you made it way more romantic than... Okay, it's completely believable - that you lived in the Shire. - Oh, no! Hobbits aren't Irish, okay. - What are they? - I don't know. They're from Middle Earth or something? Oh, look, I hope that you know that you deserve all of this, and the respect even more than the money. They... they see how special you are. You trusted me with your work, and, and I love your work so much. Do you know what that means to me? God. I was just an auction house wage slave with a normal job six months ago. Now look at us. Brooke. Take it all in. Just be here. Right here. Ansgar, we should go. Before we go back to our rooms, let's just have one more drink. Fuck! Somebody's seriously trying to reach you. Fuck. Okay. I guess we're done here. I'm sorry. I... Um... That was a little... Was it? Look, um... I love my wife. Okay. Shit. Look, I've never done this before, so I don't really know how to... Uh, shit. Get rid of me? Uh, no, I mean, like, you know, wrap this up. Pretty sure you just did. I hope you don't think that I'm playing games with you. I'm not that kind of guy. Well, maybe I'm the one playing games. I hope not. I mean, I could use someone to help my reel get into the right hands when I get my master's in June. You're serious? You're right. We really can't see each other again. No, we can't. We should agree on that. I'm sorry you'll be cutting your stay with us short. I hope you found the accommodation satisfactory. Yes. Just a change of plans. - I missed you. - I missed you too. Thanks, man. So, I have a new work. I want you to hang it as the centerpiece of the show. I would have to rearrange this entire installation to add this. I worked hard to finish it today. And trust me, it's worth it. It's uh... Is she... Does that... Um... You know, I don't think it's quite finished yet, actually. Maybe you want to put some clothes on her? Well, none of the others have clothes. The other ones don't look like me. Oh, you think this is you? What's it called? Brooke. Look, I'll find a place for it, but you can't call it Brooke. Then how about Dreams in Paris? That's even worse. Okay, we'll take it. Oh. Fantastic. Cheers. I heard he paints from his imagination. I heard he paints from his experience. Where is Brooke? Let's see her before we go. Uh, yeah, I haven't seen her in a while. I don't think he's very good. Really? I think they're so sensual and immediate. And we just bought $10,000 worth of sensual and immediate. There they are! Bravo! Bravo! They're talking. How much did you drink? Please, please. I wanna go talk to the artiste. Hi. Your beautiful art will hang on my walls. And every time I see it, I will think of you and your great talent. Well, thank you so much. That means... That means so much to me. Really does. What's all the whispering about? Some things are private. Are they? We spoke to someone at New Museum. They love Ansgar's work, and they're interested in one of the large pieces. Really? Which one? The new one. New Museum, Adam. Go buy another one, right now. Brooke is an expert in making things happen. Now, if you'll excuse me. Hello there. Hi. You look like you need a drink. I have to get a check for the caterer. I will come with. I want to hear more about Paris. Oh, my God. - What? - That woman. Who is she? No one. Why does she look so familiar? I have a serious problem right now. Is... Is that the girl from the bar? Fuck! Why would she show up here? She probably just knows the artist. Don't know. I think she's looking for me. - Why? - Because I didn't give her my number. Okay, look, we have to get our story straight. Our story? What the hell happened? Look, you have to back me up on this. Oh, my God. Are you stupid? You're the one who left me at a bar with a woman who's clearly coming on to me. That's our story? You know I can't get drunk anymore. All right, look, listen to me. We've never seen her. Bad idea, okay? Just say you met her at the bar... I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. You took a fucking picture with her, asshole. Hey! I'm about ready to close up. Yeah, let's close up. Yeah. Who's that? Who? That woman. Do you know her? Uh, it's possible... I don't know her. Maybe you've met her. I haven't. Yeah, he meets a lot of people. I thought she looked familiar. We have, like, a bunch of new interns at the station. Yeah, she looks like she would be an intern. Let's ask her if that's how you know her. I've never seen her before. Brooke, this'll lovely lady was just saying how much she liked my newest painting. The one the New Museum wants. Would you like to buy it too? If only I could. This is your gallery, yes? Yes, yes. Hi. Brooke Gatwick. Amy. Hi. This is my husband, Owen. We've met, right? I don't think so. Hi. Oh, um... You must look like someone. I must be confused. Gramercy's, Wednesday? - Oh. - Uh, were you there? I thought so. Probably off the television. I hear you're incredible with dogs. Dog weddings in a chapel. Right? Oh, that's why you're going to Vegas, is it? Well, it's late, uh... Should we all get going? Just us, then. - All right. - All right. - I will see you. - I will call you. Thank you for everything. Good night. I'm gonna be locking up in a few minutes. Oh. Okay. Um... I read your profile in ArtNews. I'm so happy to have met you. Well, it is an honor, truly. You know, I'd like to buy art someday. I could use some pointers. Um, I'm going to get going, okay? Oh, please wait. I'm almost done here. I'll be waiting outside. I would love to give you some pointers. You know, I should really probably get going. Oh, no, no. You just got here. You want to close up? I can come back. It's okay. I'll give you a quick tour. Oh, okay. It would be wise to say your goodbyes to your paying customers. And I love that you're always thinking about pleasing the customers, which affords me the luxury of thinking about the art. Thanks for the ride. So, this where you live? No, I just have to drop something off. No need to wait, though. It's okay. I'll wait. Oh, what the fuck? What? Is your wife home? What do you want? Is she home? No, she's not. Please let me in. I need to tell you something. Oh, come on! For fuck's sake! I never talked to her about us. That's not why I went to the gallery. I promise. What? Okay, look, you have no idea of the whole story here. What are you talking about? You don't even understand. I actually met your wife a few days ago. Men like Ansgar are very good for our business. Absolutely. Core to our business. When you've been doing what we've been doing for long enough, you just conclude that everybody cheats. The wives are just better at not getting caught. Yeah. I mean, I've been hiring so many private investigators, I could teach a course at Quantico. I'll be right back. Yeah. Are you okay? Owen's been giving me shit about Ansgar texting all the time, but he gets up and texts in the middle of the night too. Owen is a news guy. The news never sleeps. He's been acting weird lately. Do you think he's messing around? No. You're just letting the stress of the opening get to you. Put your phone away. Pay your man a little attention. It's all he wants right now. Right, Right. Just be direct. Right. Downplay the fact that you're going to be in a Paris hotel with the world's sexist man alive. Okay, get out of here. Go talk to her husband before I have to represent you. What? Owen told me who he was texting late at night. He says, it's one of the new producers named Sarah. And? And... I stole his iPad. That is a complete violation of privacy and trust. Do you his password? Yeah, you do. I'm just trying to figure out if I have a reason to worry. Okay, well, this iPad is marital property. So legally, I see nothing wrong with what's happening here. Okay, first, I want to say, in my defense, I did not want to snoop, but I just saw his messages come in. And he's been acting weird. He's been staying out later than usual. And he says it's just work assignments, but I don't know where he really is or what he's really doing with her. So many men use the working late excuse. You want to have a child with this man? I know, but this is Owen we're talking about. So many years of nothing but good, I'm not worried at all. Honestly, I don't think he's really cheating, but it just makes me wonder if he would cheat. It's the sliver of doubt that's killing me. God, I hate this about myself. Okay. There's a few way we can do this. I'm listening. I always tell my clients, if you want to prove that your husband's cheating, you should hire a PI to tail him. But if you want to know for sure that your husband wouldn't cheat, you hire a decoy. - What's that? - I use them all the time. A decoy is going to flirt with him, give him an opening and see what he does. And if the husband takes the bait, does the decoy go all the way? No! No, no, no, no, no. They have a professional code of ethics. Like hitmen. Damn. That's dark. - I don't think I need to know that badly. - You don't. Owen is the sweetest guy ever, and you're lucky he puts up with you. I know. But if you do find your insecurities keeping you up at night, call this agency. They're open 24 hours. - I won't call. - You shouldn't. But if you do, get my volume discount. Hi, this is Owen Shore. I'm sorry I couldn't take your call. Please leave a message. If you get a break, please call me. Bye. Right here's fine. Um... Are you, Brooke? I am. Are you the one they're sending? Yes. Amy, I'm the operative. "Operative." Sounds official. It's just a job that's paying for grad school. Speaking of payments... Yes, I take half now and then the other half when I bring you the video from the video guy across the room and the audio from my phone. Okay. Has he been unfaithful before? I don't think so. I don't know. Do you have kids? No. Not yet. Great. Uh, and I'll just need to see a picture. They said you didn't attach one. I'd rather not send this. You know, I'm not sure you're his type. Um... Yeah, maybe, um, it's hard to tell. I... I'm more attractive when I go out. Um, is there a perfume he likes, or... I'm not gonna tell you what kind of perfume he likes. You're wearing Chanel. My mom has that perfume. Look, I know this is probably really strange for you, and you don't know me at all, but honestly, you have nothing to worry about with me. I have a boyfriend who I'm very much in love with. This gig is just really good money. Thank you. Uh, this is my number. I already have you saved into my phone as Brianna. And if you decide at any point that you don't want to go through with this, just send me the message: "Sorry. Have to bail." Okay. And you respond, so I know you got it. Yeah, I'm like a normal person who texts. Glad to have met you. You know, I didn't think I'd get any more jobs till after the holidays. It's a slow time of year. Just be here. Right here. Ansgar, we should go. Before we go back to our rooms, let's just have one more drink. Owen. What? I just have to send a message and cancel something really quick. I gotta go. I thought you said your wife is out of town. I'll be right back. Ladies' room. Order us two monkeys. I really want your advice on where I should send my reel. Look, relax. Hey. Look at where we are. I mean, is there anything better than this? You're right. All good now. I'm back. I have to go. Now do you think they'll actually pay us? They better. Or I'll break their legs. Oh, is that what gallery owners do? That is what gallery owners do. That is why I got into this business, for the danger. Oh wow. Okay. Back off. Let me ask you. Amanda Gysler was pursuing you heavily and her gallery is established. So, why did you go with me? You're more beautiful. Really? And I didn't want to share. Ah. The real reason. How you were willing to go all in on me for a solo show. I appreciate that commitment to risk. The feeling's mutual. And you are more beautiful. Yeah. Mm. So have you always loved artists? I love art more than I love artists. Come on, you like me. Well, you're the exception. So why did you choose me? Your work was the most beautiful. You know, when I look at you, I see colors. - Really? - Yeah. I found out there's something different about my brain. When I see colors, I hear music. And when I hear music, I see colors. That's called synesthesia. Yeah. I look up at the sky, I see blocks of color moving, and hear music. And everything about us, is color and music... in my brain. I love that. You know, there's something in my room we want to show you. Would you like to see it? Sorry. Everything okay? I'm just waiting on a message. Um, I don't have any bars here. I think I have to go find some reception. Look, your husband's probably working late. Can you just... be here? I can't. I might have made a huge mistake at home. Excuse me. I have to... Have to get a hold of Owen. I think we should just say goodnight night now. I think... I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. God, come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. You sure you just don't want to help me with my reel to get my foot in the door? You want to answer that? I should. You should. Hey. Hi. Finally, you answered. Yeah, everything okay? Yeah. Did I wake you? What time is it there? It's... It's after 7 a.m. I tried to text you and call you last night. Yeah, they just came through now. Oh, there must have been a delay. How'd it go? Great. We sold five paintings. Five? This is not important. No, it is. Did you, uh, end up at Gramercy bar? Owen, did you go to Gramercy last night? I got... I got a quick drink and I came home. I'll see you tonight. I'm coming home early. Oh? Yeah. Well, mission accomplished. You know, I have so much work to do. I have to get back. All right, well... You should probably get to bed. I'm sure it's late there. Yeah... bed. Owen? We're okay? Are we? Yes. Yes. I love you. Love you, too. Hi. Sit down. Where you going? I have to go home now. But our tickets are for tonight. You understand why I have to get back. No, Brooke. If you have feelings for me, if there are feelings here, then... Let's not judge it. Let's not resist it, like... I can't stop thinking about you. You worked so hard to get here. I'm yours. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll find a place for it, but you can't call it Brooke. Then how about Dreams in Paris? That's even worse. Hi there. Oh, hi. You're early. Um... That's okay. Come in. - This... - What? Was that the artist that just left? Yes. Okay, so what do you have for me? All right. Uh... I have to tell you something. I let something happen that I shouldn't have. Okay. My phone died. It died? I have too many apps or something, um... Um, I don't know what's wrong with my battery. It's a... It's a new phone... too, so I didn't get any audio. What about video? Video guy didn't show. Yeah. I know it looks really bad, um... Nothing happened. He was completely faithful to you. He passed. Can I get you a coffee? - Water? - Yeah. I have to be somewhere, so... But you must have a little time to tell me what happened. Please, sit. Um, okay. Yeah, I... I got to the bar. I spotted your husband. Last time you got drunk, you tried to find a house for every homeless guy in New York City. I don't remember that. Yeah, exactly. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Just one more. That's when I noticed my phone was dead. No, I gotta go. I'm pretty sure Eleanor put a tracking app on my phone. Hi, there. He was getting ready to leave with his friend, so I stalled them by asking a question about journalism. - Let me ask you a question. - Okay. Do you and your wife have a top five list for a hall pass? What, like a list of celebrities that we give each other permission to sleep with if the opportunity ever presented itself? - Exactly. - No. No. What? Brooke would never go for such a thing. - What? - Ever. Why, who's on yours? Well, I got my boyfriend to agree to a list but it's um... it's kind of eclectic. - No judgment. - Mm. Okay. Come on, just tell me who's number one on the list. Well, it's not number one I'm afraid to tell you, it's number four. - Number four? - Yeah. The suspense is killing me. Number four... Owen Shore. Shut up. There's some news you can use. We talked for 20 minutes. I gave him some openings, but he clearly was not into me at all. I thought maybe if I could get him to have another drink, it might up my chances, but he would not have one more drop. He was a perfect gentleman... Completely clear about where he stood. Aren't you bothered that no one's talking about the homeless crisis anymore? So bothered. I tried to reach you. I texted you the code to call it off but you never responded. Well, you didn't need to 'cause he wasn't interested. So you talked about work for those 20 minutes? Yeah, we talked about the business. We talked about how to get a leg up. Breaking in. Huh. Owen gets uncomfortable when he's approached about work. That wasn't my perception. Okay, well, right now I'm getting your perception, but what I need are the facts. The fact is this: your husband passed the test. I made some clear advances, and he declined. Amy, I have no proof that you were even there. I have proof. Hmm. Uh, this is a napkin that he autographed. So are we good? I have to pay you. Right. You know what, I'm not gonna take that. But it's not your fault that your phone died and the video guy didn't show, right? Please. Take it. Thanks. You should come to the opening tonight. You can meet Ansgar. Will your husband be there? What does it matter? I think you'd enjoy it. Hmm. Dog weddings at the chapel. Right. Oh, that's why you're going to Vegas, is it? Well, it's late. Uh, should we all get going? Uh... Just us then. There you are. I need to tell you something. Are you fucking crazy? What are you doing? You can't be here. You have no idea what's going on here. - I think I do. - No, you actually don't. - Hey! - Hey. - Found you. - Hmm. So uh, fancy grabbing a drink? I really should go. It's... It's still early. Come with me. Brooke, I'm leaving. I will see you in the morning. Oh, the husband scowls in the shadows. Fuck off. Fuck off? Well, fuck me, news boy. Yeah, fuck you. Help! Help! Oh! Owen! Get... Get off of him. Get off! What is wrong with you? He's so jealous he can't control himself. - You're fucking crazy. - Fuck you! - You okay? You're bleeding. - I'm fine. Oh, my God. Do you need to go to the hospital? I'm not going to the hospital. You are not getting on your motorcycle. She's right. You're a mess. Look, I'm done. If you wanna grab a drink, let's go. Okay. Fine, fine. Let's go. Are you hurt? Physically? I... I'm dropping him. Let's go home. Owen, are you sure you don't know that woman? The one that was with Ansgar? I don't know her. So you didn't meet her at Gramercy Bar when I was in Paris? Not that I remember. Do you remember this? What... She gave this to you? When did she give this to you? What did she say? I want you to tell me. I... I don't understand. - She gave that to you? - Yes, she did. Okay, maybe I gave her an autograph. I don't remember. You know, it was crowded, and I can't... So you talked to her? I just don't understand why you couldn't say that to begin with. Honestly, it was all a blur. Okay? Okay, look. All right, I... Right. I was leaving with Adam. Some girl comes up, she asks for an autograph. Is this something we need to make a big deal out of? A girl at a bar? Do we need to make a big deal about it? You tell me. I don't know. She's a fan. She could say anything. Like what? Who knows? Crazy shit. You think she would do that? You never know, like... Well, you try to be nice, you give an autograph, give 'em a picture. Oh, you took a picture with her, too? Yeah. Yeah. On her cell phone? Yeah. She said she was gonna put it online, which I was not very happy about. Are you sure she used her cell phone? Yeah. Adam took the picture. Look, what difference does it make? You're lying. No, I'm not. I want you to tell me exactly if something happened more than what you're telling me. Don't lie to me. All right, all right. - All right what? - You're right, okay? There's... There's more to the story. There's a story? Look, okay, I never meant for things to get out of hand. - What? - And... You were spending a lot of time with him, - and I was losing it. - Oh, my God. - Okay? - What did you do? Oh, my God. Um, can we pull over? - Can we just talk at home? - No, no, no! I need to get out. Can you let me out? - Brooke... - Yo, can you stop the car? - Brooke, stop! - Stop the car right now! God damn it! Brooke. Brooke! Hey! Hey, just come back to the cab, okay? We can go home and talk... Just say what you have to say. Oh, my God. You can't even say it. Brooke! Hey! Hey. Look, I made a mistake. Don't touch me! You have to hear me. Okay? In all the years we've been married, I have never done anything inappropriate. I've never done anything to undermine our relationship. Owen, did you have sex with her? You had sex with her. Look, I feel terrible, okay? I don't know what... I'm sorry. Brooke, please, just listen, okay? - Just listen. Hey... - Get away from me! All those women at work that you go on trips with, your late night outings... Give me your phone. - Please, let's go home. - No. I want your phone to look through all your texts and everything right now. I know the truth. Oh, no. What did you do? You have no idea... You don't understand. I actually met your wife a few days ago. What are you talking about? She hired me. - Hired you? - Yes. For what? Like a job at the gallery? - No. - Then for what? She hired me as a... an operative. A decoy. A what? I knew you'd be at Gramercy that night. She set me up? Yes. You were supposed to have sex with me? No. No. Okay? That was my own fuck-up. Because, actually, you really are number four on my list. Sorry, I don't want to talk about it right now. Hey, Owen, did you just call? We've got lots of Senator McVane tips coming in, so keep your phone close by. Kim says we'll send you out on the best lead if we can confirm the address. Oh, I didn't want to text this because I know it's a surprise, but my aunt said her Paris apartment is all good for you and Brooke if you want it for Christmas, okay? So, call me. Bye. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I live here. Amy just went inside. This is a situation... Oh, shit. Did he call and tell you I wasn't here? Did you rush over? She just wanted us all to be on the same page. Look, I realize I crossed a line. I... - Yeah, when? - What? When did you decide to cross that line? I was enjoying our conversation. Oh, about what, your boyfriend that you're very much in love with? - I had a hall pass. - Oh, really? Brooke, Brooke. Oh, protecting your little prostitute? I'm not the one who paid her to have sex with me. She wasn't... You weren't supposed to do that to me. I thought that you would be able to say no. I was banking on the proof and in comfort of knowing with 100 percent certainty that my husband would be faithful. I thought that, you know, even if I... What? Say it. Say what you did to me. Even if I created the circumstances. I have never made a move in my life that wasn't about you. You're right. I fucked up. I reacted. And I did something wrong. But the ironic thing is, just for a second I thought, yeah, I'm doing something fucked up. And I'm doing it for me. For me, just for once. But it wasn't. You did this to me. Fuck you. Okay, I just really have to say for the record that I have always been completely professional and I have never had an incident like this before. You really have no shame. That might be true. But you know what? I'm not the one who dangled a chick in front of my husband to see if he'd fuck her. I don't know why you'd mess all this up. You have a really nice apartment. Hey. "Hey" what? You wanna talk about it? I need to know, Brooke. Did anything happen in Paris? No. Full honesty? Hey, all cards out on the table. No, I'm not gonna answer that question. Well, would you please fucking answer that question? Were you unfaithful to me? And what if I was? Meaning? I may have made a huge mistake at home. We should say goodnight, now. I think I'm... I'm sorry. Owen's cheating on me. I know it. I can... I can feel it. Cheatin'? Cheating, as in fucking someone who's not me. And it's all my fault. Hey. Can I show you something? Hey, come on. Now, can you see that corner there? Two years ago, I was sleeping there, on that sidewalk. I had no one. I was drawing pictures on walls with chalk. Some people helped me. You, most of all. And now I'm here. And you're here. Look... If Owen's away somewhere... that's good news. It means you're free to do whatever you like. No rules. Live for each moment. Do you think it matters to the universe... if you kiss me or not? Be totally with me. Totally with me. In this exact moment. All cards on the table? As they say in Vegas, baby, when you tie, it's a push. Meaning what? Meaning you hiring Amy makes us even? Meaning what? I can't. Meaning I don't have to tell you, and that's what makes us even. The car's here. Wait. Are you coming back for Christmas? Is this it? Your Vegas ticket? No. Departs in three hours from JFK. Christmas in Paris. Two tickets. I think she wants to wait until morning to open all her presents. Should I make some hot cocoa? I could get my money back.
