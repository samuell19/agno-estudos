Halloween is in need of an upgrade. You people forgot what fear tastes like. This man's gonna die and to prove it his body' will turn up in the next 24 hours. The world acts like its safe but with little or no effort you could take the world hostage. This Halloween, with Kane and Judas at my side, we're gonna do something this world will never forget! Halloween is next week. We're coming to change Halloween forever. I'm Barabbas, and others from the dark world will be joining us for this game. This is your only warning, world! This Halloween, the Dark Military's coming to play! Good Morning, it's October 31st, Halloween, here on Satellite 16, Dark Radio. It's been one week since a group calling themselves the Dark Military broadcasted on the dark web the grizzly murder of Ron Rubens. Film of this murder has now been witnessed worldwide. Mr. Rubens's body, who disappeared from Idaho, was discovered in St. Michaels, New York. What does this mean? You're live with Late In the Morning, First caller, Wendy from Blairstown. Wade, this is unacceptable. All this time and still no one knows who they are? I'm keeping my kids home this Halloween. I just wanna say our town has something fun and different goin' on. You've heard of Survival Ground by now, haven't you? The Survival Ground broadcast will go as planned on Halloween. More pictures have recently surfaced of the Dark Military on the dark web. How do we know the hostages are still alive? The buyrates are through the roof. The town of St. Michaels will move forward. I mean, what are the rules to this game? We're the hostages. We don't know what's coming through the front door. Is provoking world history. The whole world will be watching. All news outlets will be covering this. - So how's everything going with the school play? - It's going great, tonight's the big night. My daughter can't wait for her scene. You know, even at home she's never outta costume. She's always in character! Yeah. Hey, um, where's the chief? - He oughta be here any minute. He's showing a little bit more face since, uh... Hey, it's okay but you gotta get over this. - I know. It's just all week with the media, and then the video goes viral and makes world news. - Listen, listen, those guys aren't gonna show their face and their gonna get caught. Everything is gonna be fine. Caller has now been able to close the front-- - Henning, Martel, good morning. - Morning, Chief, how's it goin'? - I feel like shit but everything else is cool. Besides the press making rounds where the body was found, all is well. We gotta get through tonight, guys. After tonight, everything will be back to normal, all right? But if anything is outta the ordinary, I wanna know about it. - Survival Ground is gonna be in town tonight. It's that survival game that's been getting all the buzz on the internet. Well, those people are gonna be here in a few hours and these idiots are havin' some kind of a meet and greet at the community center. - Well I, for one, think this is good for the community. I mean, this'll get the town's mind back on Halloween and a little bit less on what happened. - Right. I'm gonna try to make it to your daughter's play, all right? No promises. Jesus, all right. Guys, get on the job, let's go! ♪ We want pussy and you know it's true ♪ ♪ Pussy, pussy, pussy ♪ - What's up, brother? - Yo, we are so doin' this shit tonight. You gonna be ready now?

I really want you to go to this with me. - I don't wanna be on TV. - It's not even TV, it's the web. At the most, you'll be a Facebook and Twitter star. Not even Fox News is even gonna be coverin' this one. - Work sounds like a great idea after hearing that. - Let me guess, you're scared to ask her, aren't you? All she does is push you around. Gives you shifts with no notice. Fuck it, just tell her you're taking a me day. - Scared? Roman, you're the one that fears your father. I mean, does he even know you're doing this? - No. - Out of all the places they had to pick for a meeting spot, they had to pick this town? - What were you expecting, a Hollywood movie set? - All I'm saying is we just drove nine hours to do this shit and now we're sitting in some coffee shop just waiting for it to start. I mean, we could do that back home. - Well, you're the asshole that wanted to get here just in case god forbid we didn't get a good parking spot.

Tonight, live on pay-per-view the world is in for something different. - You heard it here first! - All right, so where do we sign up for this? This isn't gonna be any of that kid shit, is it? - We can still hit the road and make the party. - Fuck that, a party's just a party. I wanna be on pay-per-view! - Did you get that? We got that. - We're still rolling? - We're live. - Ooh hoo, speaking to the enchanting Jezebel. The website states you don't receive the rules until the bus arrives at the hunting ground. - Well, in a short bit, Mother Nature will be addressing all of those questions. - Yes, but can you tell us who will be the one doing the hunting? - You'll have to wait for the pay-per-view to start. Could be anybody really. Freddy, Jason, maybe even Frankenstein's monster. - Where is Christopher Lee when you need him? John Hedberg reporting. I'm out. All right, well, that was great, thanks a lot, thanks a lot, Jezebel. Did you get that? Clear? Off to the next one. - Hi, I'm Travis. - Well, hello, Travis. - Question, if I get killed off early in this thing what are the chances of you and I getting some alone time? - And do you think alone time would be fun? - I can think of a few ways to kill time. - Listen. Travis, tonight I promise I'll make some alone time for us. - Whoo! - All right, all I'm seeing is girls and zombies. Who the hell is hunting us? - I don't know, but this looks really PG. What did we sign up for? - All right, it's set. - What's that? - Look at Travis. - Me and Jezebel. - Get the fuck outta here. - Dude, I was just talking to her. She was practically craving my dick as soon as I told her my name. - Oh, she's craving your dick? - Will you guys knock it off? Seriously, Roman? Is this the shit that I have to deal with? I didn't quit my job to sign up for a sausage fest. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Too bad for you, Lainie, someone already put a down payment on this sausage. Now, if you excuse me, Travis has gotta fill up his November calendar with some new draft picks. - And there he goes, the CEO of herpes. - Burger, burger! - Hello, chef. - Burger. - I'm all right. - Burger! - Thank you. - I have more on the grill, on the grill! - That's perfect. - How is it? - I haven't taken a bite yet but it's-- - How is it, is it good? - It's good, it's good! - It's amazing, thank you. - I think it's terrific. - Oh my god. - It weren't for you wouldn't eat it, that's crazy. - That guy takes his work really serious, huh?

See, he's smart. - So did you drive far for this? - No, I didn't come far. - You know, she's single by the way. - Dean! - Just throwing that out there.

It's part of the game. There's no cheating, silly. - All right, kiddos, at this time I would like you to give this lovely lady your cellphones and board the bus. - Why? - Well, my pet, a cellphone is an advantage in this day and age. It can help you in the hunt and I cannot have that. - And what if I don't wanna give up my fucking cellphone?

Nobody even knows who's producing this thing. - You don't have to be here, you know, just 'cause I'm grounded. You can still go to the dance. - You're my best friend. I'm not just gonna leave you on Halloween by yourself. - I'm fine, I got this to watch. - I'm going to watch the video with you. Most of the kids at school are anyway. - Wait, wait, wait, they boarded the bus three or four hours ago. Where is this, where is this taking place? - Well, that's the thing.

Hey, she might find it sexy though. Like that chick in Porkys who looks through the boys locker room. - Dude, you're a fucking dick, man. - I'm a dick without a tribal band tattoo. - Travis, you do not have a tribal band tattoo. - Hey look, 1995 called you want a tattoo either or. - Dude, what the fuck is this? I haven't seen one damn camera crew. The whole time I didn't see a thing and no one knows that we're here. - It's pay-per-view, all right, relax. They're just trying to amp us up, I bet we're not far. I bet the bus just took a couple of lefts around the main roads for a few hours to throw us off. - Did you hear that Lea girl? She said she was some kinda famous model-actress something. And look, she's still trying to get her cell back. Pathetic, pathetic. - Idiot. - This is fucking awesome! - Awesome, ain't nothin' happened! We're in a field! - Um, where's the camera crew? - Okay. - Not sure, but I guess questions will all be answered before go time. - I really wanna get my cellphone back so can you like give it to me please? What the fuck? - Hey, you wanna tell us what's going on? - Yeah, like what are we supposed to do? - My children, my work here is done. Soon you will meet the hunters and then the game will begin. - Jezebel, can I come with you? - What, wait! - Hey, yo, yo! - Wait! - Yo, where you goin'? - No, we're not just standing here! - Yo, this isn't part of the deal, where you goin'? - Hey! - Man, what the hell am I looking at here? I thought you said this was supposed to be good. Bunch of douches. - I don't know, man. I'm watching the same fucking thing you're watching. - Hey, yo! - What's going on, this is stupid. - This whole thing is a big letdown. - Guys, it's okay! I found more beer! - Yeah, I think this thing shit the bed. - It sure the hell did. - Yes, I got one, that's right! I got it! Yes, yeah, woo! - Yes, that's what I'm talking about, man. No one beer queers here, baby. - Yo, it's... - Holy shit, is that them? - Yo. - It's a little too soon to be dressing up like that, don't you think? - I told you all that we'd return at Halloween. I told you that tonight we were gonna take the world hostage. Welcome, kids. And welcome everybody watchin' back home. We don't have a camera crew, it's just us. With the funds we got from our buyrates, we have hidden cameras covering this whole hunting ground. Our general has given us orders to hunt you down and kill you all. Tonight, myself, Barabbas, along with Kane, Jezebel, Judas, we will put the fear back in Halloween. We are the Dark Military. We said we would return tonight. As we told the world, a body will show up within 24 hours and it did. Tonight, all the bloodier bodies will come-- - What kinda weapons do we get? - Shut the fuck up! Here are the rules. In a few minutes we will go live. The broadcast will last two hours, not a second more. Listen and listen good. The weapons you see here are real, we will use them. Now is the time to put your game faces on. No one has any idea where you are. It was hard seeing out those windows coming here, wasn't it? I sure wouldn't get on that bus if I couldn't see where I was goin'. None of you called that into question with the free drinkin' thing goin' on. Oh yeah, about your cellphones. Wait, that's my phone. - My cellphone better not have been in that bag. - Yo, I wanna know where this bus is. Don't fuckin' look at me like that. Are you fuckin' deaf, I said don't look at me like that. Nah, nah, fuck this shit, man. Come on, this is fuckin', what the fuck is happening here? Nah, forget about it. I'm fuckin' outta here. - Kids, this military has orders to hunt you down. If any of you are still standing after two hours then you're one of the winners. The clock has started. We will give you a one minute start to get away. Go! - So what, wait a second, what the hell is this shit? We're supposed to just run into the woods? - And what do we win? - What is that? - And what do we win? 'Cause you said you were hunting us so do we get like a map or anything 'cause I don't understand this. This is my Halloween. This is the most unorganized thing I have ever been a part of! - Hey man, listen, just got this drink. Listen, I'm kinda drunk and my shoulder's acting up so you think it'd be cool if I just watched or something? - Civ, you gotta be kidding me. We came all the way out here and you just wanna check out? Come on, let's go. - Son, if you're still standing here in about 30 seconds, I'm gonna put this meat cleaver right in your fuckin' head. - It's cool, man, I'll check out now, I'll be the first. Sonya, baby, you go ahead, I'll be cool here. - Civ, goddammit. - Fuck it, we're starting now. - Baby! - Holy shit, Jesus! - Holy shit, dude, this is real. - Is this real? - This isn't a joke, Sophia. - Where are the police? - Get the state capital on the line, right now. We need to know where that bus went. - Two hours, not a second more. Everybody's watch is set. - Start checking on every traffic camera. - It's play time. - Is that my Travis? Some of your friends didn't make it but I really enjoyed killing them. It's time to die now, sweetie. - How do you want me? - Lay down on your back for me. - Can't he tell something's wrong? This chick has blood all over her for fuck's sake! - He needs to run. - What is he doing? - Come on, Travis, can't you see what's happening? - Are you ready? - More ready for when the productions over though. - What's wrong, Travis? Don't you want me anymore? - That's it, girls, I don't want you watchin' this. We have to drive on Halloween. As it is, Halloween's already been canceled. - Oh come on, man. Do we even know what the fuck just happened? - Oh my god, you guys, they'll be here soon. I mean, they know where we are, right? - Quiet down, quiet down, Lainie. We're gonna get through this, okay? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. - We gotta find the others, guys. - And then what, Griffin? Half of them are fucking drunk, the others are stupid. The more people that join us, the more they're gonna be able to fuckin' find us, all right, we can't have that happen. We gotta fuckin' just keep goin' ourselves. - Oh, you already counted everybody out? Man, you're unbelievable, man! That's fucked up! - Do you wanna fucking lead this team, dude? - Man, get the fuck outta here! - What the fuck do you know except how yes, fucking, yes? - Don't hit me with that shit. - No, you fucking know what I'm talking about! - No! - What the fuck? Come on, man. - Yo, where the fuck did you come from? - Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea what just happened out there? - What do you mean? - This is real, all of it, don't you get it? - What do you mean real? - Keep your fuckin' voices down. - They murdered those two punks back there and all those other guys were real. This isn't a joke, this isn't a game. - Oh, come on man, this is shit. It's not like nobody knows where we are, come on. - Bro. - Do you see anything, Teddy? - All right, man. - Any signs of life? Do you even know where the fuck you're at? - You need to calm down, for real. Get the fuck outta here, man. - I'm not sure where you're all trying to lead us but we plan on winning this thing. - That's right. - Nothing to fucking win, man, don't you get that? - All right, all right, come on, come on, enough. - No no no no no no, please. We gotta keep going! - All right, calm down, Ms. Drama Queen, all right? - What the fuck? - Tonight we're all famous so everyone wave to the cameras! - Goddammit. You're gonna lead them right to us, man. Fuck this, we're fuckin' outta here. - Oh, come on! Run, Forrest, run! - We should do it right now. - Right now? - Yeah. - Oh no no, fuck yeah! - Yeah? - No, no, all those cameras are just beside us right now. You know it. Come on, do it now. Oh! Woo, woo! - I love you, I love you! - Yeah! That's fuckin' awesome. - Henning, what do we got? - Well, they took Route Six about 10 minutes then they turned off an old country road. And they coulda been on that bus for three or four hours. Chief, there's no cameras on that road. That bus coulda made a turn anywhere. Hey, have you got any dried fish? Sure, we got dried fish. - Yo, hold on. Yo. - Yo, what's goin' on? - Yo, are you watchin' this shit? - What shit? - You need to log onto your computer right now. I'm gonna send you a link. You're not gonna believe this. - What's going on? Hello, why don't you give him a drink? - Okay. - Just, just watch. - This is Gilda Silverman. I am standing along Route Six right at the corridor where Pennsylvania meets New York, where hours ago a group calling themselves the Dark Military came into a small town and took our children to a hunting ground. This is now being broadcast live on the web. This is the same group that last week killed Ron Rubens live on the dark web and dumped his body along Route Six. The question is how did we let this happen? Where is this deadly game taking place? - Ah, shit! - Seriously, guys. We gotta come up with a gameplan or something. - We just need to keep goin'. Then find a road, just keep goin' till we find one. - How do we know we're not goin' in circles? - I've had it, I'm done. I don't wanna play this game anymore! Shit! Damn it. Can anyone hear me? - Lea? Guys, we have to help her, come on, come on. - Fuck. - Fuck this shit. Damn it, I've had it. I'm done, I quit. Oh shoot. Can anyone hear me? I'm done playing this game! - Well, you didn't think that went through very well, did you? Don't you know as soon as the killers are identified in a horror movie you should run? - Listen asshole, I don't know who you think you are but I'm done here. Your special effects are terrible. This whole thing is a joke. Take me back to the bus, I--. - There's your cellphone, bitch! - Nice of you to finally show up, Delilah! - Shut the fuck up, Barabbas! - So how was your date? - We broke up. - You're gonna be single forever. - Louis Rickles again reporting live from Pennsylvania Township. Happy Halloween, woo hoo! Dark Military, awesome! Just go. - Is it possible, all right, ready? Louis Rickles reporting live from Pennsylvania Township, and as more and more details come across the News Six desk this scene is appearing more and more grim. - The Dark Military who came into this town and took children into a hunting ground now being broadcasted live on the web. - Officials have been going door to door trying to find anyone that may have seen the Dark Military bus. - We've also gotten reports that air support teams are looking into this densely-wooded area and are no closer to pinpointing the destination of this deadly hunting-- Yo, Louis Rickles sucks a dick! - Broadcasting. - Yeah, broadcasting. - Okay, they found Troy and Dolly Borden. Our newsroom has just received a tape direct from the Dark Military. We have no idea what timeframe this video took place. We know for a fact this night was planned. What is happening is real. What you are about to see is not for the faint of heart. So you have a plan. - Right about now, the first of the kills have already happened. We could have taken them all out but what fun would that have been? How could you be so sure that your plan will work? - My plan? The general's plan never fails! So why are you doing this? - You know, when a tragedy hits they always seem to find out everything about it but you know when they do? After it's over! This year will be no different. Halloween will get its upgrade. Kane, bring me one of the girls! - No. Let her go! Let her... Nah, nah, let... - Problem? - Man, don't do this. She's my sister, take me, take me. - Do you wanna kiss your brother goodbye? - Please, just let us go! - Fine, I'll just kiss him for you. - No! - Continue. - Let go of me! - Chief, we came in as soon as we heard. - What can we do? - Where you need us? - I need you guys to get back on the field. Get out there, all right? - Are you kidding me? We're the best you got. - That's why I need you on the field. - Yes, sir. Lieutenant. - She filming, she filming? I'm Major Bigelow, this is Agent Brody. We have very little time to isolate the location of this broadcast. - Since this town was the last place the group was seen, this station is now under federal jurisdiction. We'll be working with you, the state, the military, and the government but our primary objective is to see to it that these kids are brought back home safely. - Excuse me. - All the locals are running rampant, Chief. No one's seen anything since that bus pulled out of the lot. - Why are you here? - The play was great, look, I'm back on duty. What's our next move? - Information, we need everything we can get to pinpoint exactly where this is taking place. Mounted police and air traffic control, already in effect. - Damn! Looks like their server has some kind of a government firewall up on it. I'll tell you what, this group sure planned this out well. Chief, I can get through this firewall but it's gonna take a while. - What we need now is to find a possible location where this broadcastis coming from. - We need to keep an eye on the woods if we're gonna find any kind of lead to where they may be. - How does someone get access to a government firewall? - We should stop this broadcast. The world doesn't need to see this. - We stop this broadcast now we have nothing to go on. Nothing. We need to sit back and hope that we or somebody else watching can notice something that we can use to identify the location, understand? Everybody understand? Good. - Did you guys hear that? - Yeah, finally some signs of life. - Let's go. - What, you wanna follow it? - Yeah Lita, we have no idea what's going on and I want some answers! - Whoa! - Whoa whoa whoa whoa. - Hey! - What's going on? - Calm down. Calm down, what are you talking about? - He'll kill us, we have to go away. - Calm down, calm down, calm down, come on. - Come over here, they're hunting! - They're gonna kill us! - Come on! - Come on, come on, come on. - I can't leave her! Come on, Farrah, come on, come on. - Looks like it's just the three of us. - You guys are hunting us for real? - What's it look like to you? I like your makeup, it looks very masculine. - No! - It's just you and me now, Eggar. Think about it, you need this knife, right? I'm all by myself. I'm just a girl, right? You can take me out. Come on, Eggar, be a man, take me out! - Whoa, whoa, wait. It's another hot chick, man. Hey, sorry, babe. - Hey listen, I don't think it's that you're just sending us out into the woods with no map or anything. I don't even get what's going on! If I didn't run into these guys I'd be lost out here all night. - She got two kills, wow. It looks so real. - It does look real. - It looks real. - You have an effects team on site, right? - Oh my god! - Lenny, come on! - Come on. - Oh my god! - Just go, just go, go! - Come on. Keep going, let's go. Lenny, come on, let's go! - Shit, all right, all right, all right! Keep going, keep going, go, go! - Authorities have confirmed that the death count now stands at 12 people. We have also gotten reports that air support teams that are sweeping this dense wood are no closer to pinpointing this group's deadly hunting ground. - No one's dying tonight! - Oh, no one's dying tonight? Five people already died tonight. - Shut up! - Bro, I'm done with this. I am done with it, all right? Listen. - No, we're getting out of here, all right? - We need to go back to the plan and try to look for a road or something. - This isn't happening! - Oh, it is happening. - Look, look, guys, Griffin's right, okay? We need to find a road, that's the game plan now. - Yeah, but where are we gonna go? - Wait, wait, wait, hold up, wait! Wait, so if we're really on TV then everyone at home can hear us, right? So help, help! - No! - Someone help us please! - Help! - Please help! - Shut up! - For the love of god, oh. - Hey, guys, this is real, okay? This is a live hunt. I just spotted some cameras in the trees. Chances are they know where we are at all times. - Cameras in the trees. - You're Nelson, right? - Yeah, yeah, we spoke on the bus a while. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, when they killed those two punks I ran and lost everybody. - We gotta build a fire, a big fire because if we build a fire then someone's gonna see the smoke and then-- - If we build a fire it's gonna bring them closer to us. - Fuck the fire, okay? We need to go and just keep fuckin' goin', all right? The more we move-- - Who are these people? - Well, they seem to have planned this out pretty well. They must have had some sort of background in military training. - They're just a bunch of sick fucks, Nelson. That's all they are. - Look, they're gonna keep finding us, man. They're gonna keep finding us. - Did you notice Kane? - Guys, let's just keep going! - Kane? - Well, he never speaks. - Yeah great, Nelson, he never speaks, awesome! - Shut up, Teddy! - Well maybe he's something else. - What, a fucking alien? - Wait, wait, wait, hold up, what are you trying to say, something else? - Oh my god! Oh my god, just how did we not realize this earlier? - What? - They've been watching us on the cameras all night. No wonder they can find us so quick! Look, we will never have an advantage. - Wait a second. - Fuck that shit! Don't you ever accuse me of cheating, mother fucker! Waste that one, Kane. I want that one. - Come on! - Let me tell you something, you little vagina head, I've been nothing but honest with you and the people watching back home. I told you you were all being hunted. I told you tonight we were coming back to change history. And I even gave you a head start running. You think after all that I would cheat the game? Hold this pussy faggot still, Kane! - Oh please, I'm sorry. Just, just let me go, okay? - Please let me go! - Newsflash, Teddy, GPS just filed Chapter 11. That's how easy it is to track you. - Sweetie, stop lookin' at me. I'm starting to think you might like me. - Whatever, you both can make out after. I'll make out with her. Please, just please, just don't kill me. - What did you say? - I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! - Hang tight there, Teddy. You like what you see there, darling? - You, you leave her alone! - Shut up, Teddy! Oh! - Yeah, she likes you, Jezebel. - Nelly, don't do it. Shut up, Teddy. - Kane, let that pussy faggot go. - Well, what are you waiting for, get out of here! - What am I doing? What the fuck am I doing? I don't know, Nelly. I'm starting to think you're more into me. - I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me. - You wanna kiss, Jezebel? I think she wants to kiss you, Jezebel. - You wanna kiss me, sweetie? - Ah, you fucking dyke! Don't fucking touch me! I touch you, I'm the fucking toucher! Dumb fucking bitch, fuck you! I'll fucking kill that fucking pussy! - Oh my god! - Well, the tax ID and the bank account were hacked from some old couple in Nebraska. - Do we have a IP address yet? - Still not cracked. - I've been doing the statistics and there's no cases on record that match this but-- - How much time do we have? - Historically it could take up to two hours. - They knew, they knew and they've been mocking us in the process. - Well, we've got mounted police in every county searching all the wooded locations. And we got choppers in the air. But, Chief, this is short notice and it's been less than an hour. - Do you realize how many teenage parties are going on in the woods on Halloween night? You're gonna see light. The choppers and mounted police will just slow things down. - I'm not disagreeing with you but this is our community and we will deal with this ourselves. - We, what do you mean we? You're gonna send out lynch mobs? Yeah, I said lynch mobs 'cause that's exactly what this is gonna turn into. - These are our kids! You're just comin' from Washington tryin' to cover your ass! We will address our community about this situation. - It's not your town. It's our town now, you understand? - What the fuck you talkin' about? - Chief, Chief. - Chief, Chief. - Sit down and close your mouth! - Chief. - Sit down! - Step off, man! Yo, man, I will break... - Chief. - Sit down. Don't do it. - I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, all right, all right. All right, all right, I'm all right, I'm all right. Bottom line, I'm addressing the committee. Thanks. - Hi, I'm Jezebel. Well, hello, you seem pleasant. - You're sweet, thanks. So do you want to tell us about yourself? - I see the way you look at me. Do you wanna touch me? I was just trying to-- - See, I knew it, they all do. What's your story? - I promise. Why are you a part of this group? - We broke up. - I can't see shit. - And he said the woods had a road. Even if it's a dirt road. - We need to go back there to the site. What? - The original site, that's where the road was. - You're right. - Yeah, great idea, genius, but do you know where that is? Does anyone know where that is? - Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey. Shh, Lainie, not now. - Lainie, Lainie, look at me. - Please not now. - Lainie, look at me. - Please, please, please. - What did I already tell you? - That you were not gonna let anything happen to me. - I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Lainie, look at me. Nothing's gonna happen to you, any of us. - Right. - Let's move out. - Let's go. - 45 minutes, soldiers. We don't stop till everyone of them is dead. Let's make the general proud. - All right. I'm gonna cut to the chase. We have the most serious situation on our hands right now. - How can the police not be close? - We're not dealing with any terrorist group here. We're dealing with unknowns who are hunting for fun and mocking the world as they do it. - I can't believe what we're watching right now. - The bus boarded from this town and took a four-hour drive where the broadcast went live. They're somewhere from part of New York, New Jersey, and New England. You all know what's going on and we don't have much time. Please, I'm asking all of you to please comb the woods. Stay in large numbers. Wherever you are, I'm asking you to get up and help. Don't let this group get away with this. - May I put you on hold, please? Officer Martel. - Hello, yes, look, I'm looking for my brother Eggar. I haven't been able to get a hold of him. I don't know what's goin' on. He was one of the kids that was on the bus and my phone's been blowin' up. - May I have your name please? - My name's Vince. - Vince, okay, we're not even sure what it is that we saw. We're still hoping that this whole thing might be some Halloween joke. - Officer Martel, listen, I know my brother, okay? He's not ever without his phone. The phone's been going right to voicemail. I don't know what's goin' on. I can't get a hold of him. - We're trying to locate-- - I know my brother, okay? This isn't some kind of fuckin' prank. Something's gone wrong here, something's happened. You're telling me nobody over there knows anything? All right, look, I'm just gonna stay on hold. Someone over there has got to get me in touch with him. Please, find my brother. - Roman, Roman, Roman, Roman. Relax, what are you doin'? What were you gonna go over there for? - Man, I'm tired of playin' this game, all right? It doesn't matter, we gotta figure out what we got going here. - Roman, look at me, look at me. We don't know what the fuck's going onthere right now but you just saw what just happened. Give me a fuckin' second to check it out. Just give me one fuckin' second. - Yo, look, we can't afford to lose anybody else out here. - One second. - Dean, be careful. - Haven't you seen a horror movie? Hello. - What do you see? - Help, somebody. You gotta help. No, no, no, no! - Calm down, calm down! - Hey look, settle down! - Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy. - Yo, chill out, tough guy. For all we know that could be them in there, relax. - What, no, I'm gonna go in there! I'm gonna get some help. - Teddy. - Teddy, stop! - What the fuck are you doin? What the fuck are you doin' man? - Fuck, damn, damn! Shit! What the fuck, man? All right, what else, what else you got? - You're making too much goddamn fucking noise! What are you doing? - I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna take down every damn one of them. - Go go go go go go go go! - My kitchen! Get the fuck outta my kitchen! - Officer Martel. - Yeah, this is like the third time my call's been transferred. My name is Rory and I'm just lookin' to see if my brother Lucas is okay. - Right, your brother Lucas boarded the bus this morning and-- - Look, I just wanna know if he's okay! I'm getting all these calls that the Dark Military killed my brother. Now give me some answers! - Okay, Rory, I understand why you're upset. - Do you, do you really know? Did your brother just get fucking killed? You're the fucking police! I'm just trying to get some answers about my brother. - In a sudden turn of events, our news station has just received a video tape from the Dark Military. As reported shortly ago, World News Now has received one as well. Folks, these tapes seem to be a part of a puzzle. We've never seen anything like this before. So what do you want to tell the world about your group and what you're trying to accomplish in this? - Shut the fuck up. I want to hurt him right now. - Relax, this is a chance for the world to get to know you. - I don't want the world to know me! I just want to kill him! - You're kinda pretty. I really hate that right now. - She does have one nice set of tits. - You think so? I'm not really sure. Hey Delilah, what do you think? Does she have a better set than mine? - And what is your name? - My name is Kayla. - Kayla, are your tits better than Jezebel's? - Yeah, are they? - They might be. - Please just let me go. I won't say anything to anyone, please. - What do you think? - What do you mean? - Is this really hard to follow? Whose tits are bigger? Kayla's or Jezebel's? What is your name? - John. - And what was that? - I knew a John once, I didn't like him. - Way to ruin a sexy moment. We were about to see some tits. Guys, get em' outta here. - Please, just let me go, I won't say anything. - Shut your mouth. - No, ah! They are pretty nice. - Yeah. Stop crying! I said stop crying! - Okay, listen. I've done everything that you've asked. You're gonna let me go now, right? Right? Right? - Well, you see, we've got a problem. You see, Kane here hasn't had a chance to play yet. - No, no, let me go, let me go, let me go! Fucking dishes! - Which way they go? - No more burgers, fuck off! Quiche! Everyone gets quiche, that's what you get! Quiche for everyone! - Officer Martel. - Yes, yes, hi I'm calling, actually, I'm not sure who I should be contacting. My name is Anabel Lexington and my daughter Lea is part of the Survival Ground broadcast. All I know is this morning the ground meeting was in your township. That's where she went. Can you please get me in touch with her? - We're doing everything we can right now to figure out where this thing is taking place. - Are you telling me that you don't know where she is? - This thing can still just be one big-- - Prank, no I don't think so? If this was a prank, my daughter would have gotten in contact with me to let me know. For the last 15 minutes, my phone has been ringing off the hook, please, I am so worried. Get me in contact with my child. - Everybody in the Tri-State area is doin' their part. Every county. - This is all happening way too fast. - Doing all we can, Sawyer, stay with me. - You guys got any leads on who these people are yet? - You okay? - It's just phone call after phone call. These heartbroken parents, there's so much anger. We are gonna find them in time, right, Chief? - We need to do something guys. I mean, every time we run our numbers get smaller. - Dude, we need to find a way out of here. - Someone has to find us. Help has to be on the way. - If they knew where we were, don't you think that they'd be looking for us by chopper? I haven't heard one all day, have you? - We gotta stop runnin'. We gotta make a stand. You think runnin's the answer. We've been running all night and they've been picking us off one by one, and that exactly what they want. - Wait wait wait wait. Let's just try something else first. - What, Les? - I don't know. - I'm so sorry I brought you here. - Roman, I need to know we're all on the same page here. I'm in. - I need to know everybody's with me on this. - I'm in. Nelson? - Yeah. - We need you here, Les. - Dean, they have weapons though. What can we use to fight them? - Whatever we can find. - Let's load up, find what you can. - It's about time they stopped and fought them. - Fuck that, dude. The Dark Military has all the weapons here. I'd run too. - Ready for this? - Ready as I'm gonna be. - It's just like when we used to fight the other schools growing up, right? - They didn't have knives, Dean. - But no matter what we're in this to the end, together. - To the end. - Connor, they can't win, can they? - I don't know, Chris. - How can help not be close? - Here they come, get ready. - Well, well. It's about time you guys realize strength isn't within numbers. You know, never understood in the horror movie when the killers are identified, why the teams just never ganged up and took them out. - Why are you doing this, why? - This must be the part of the movie where they wanna know our backstory! Well, tell you what, I got a great idea. Let's ask, Kane. - Looks like you guys are shit outta luck. - Dean, you got a lotta balls, kid. But I question your heart, though. Show me what you got, kid. - You know what I wonder? How tough you are now that the numbers are even. - Come on, kid, show 'em what you got! - Come on! - You scared, little girl? - Bitch! - Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you, fuck you! Bitch! - Get the fuck off of me! - Bitch! - You little bitch. - Well, look at you, Judas, all fucked up! - Fuck you! - Jezebel, bring that bitch over here. - You heard him, let's go! - Agent Brody, Agent Bigelow, is that it? Are they gonna get away with this? - We told you we were gonna put the fear in Halloween. We told all of you that we'd return on this day and we outsmarted the system. We held to our word, we are honorable soldiers. The jokes on you. You all bought the broadcast. And I bet instead of helping most of the world was on social media. Yeah, Americans get distracted easily. This country really isn't a superpower. Nobody is really safe. You all sat back while this happened. Take technology away, it really shows the world didn't come very far. Well, it's gettin' close to closin' time. Time to wrap this up. - No more burgers! Kitchen is a wreck! I can't find my favorite ladle! How am I supposed to make anything without my favorite ladle? - All right, Jimbo, all right! - You, you, stay out of Cook's kitchen because Cook can't make your favorite dishes if you're in the kitchen! - It's okay, Jimbo, just go back to the kitchen. - The kitchen is a wreck! Oh ho, the kitchen's a wreck! I can't make anything anymore. No more burgers for you or them! First put the noodles in the pot then turn the stove on, then put the butter in for macaroni. Then chop up the hot dogs! Then put the quiche in but don't forget the hot dogs. - My military, we have something over all of you that you don't have. We have heart. - You have no fuckin' heart! - What was that, son? - You heard me, you have no fuckin' heart. Look at you, you hide behind a mask. You need a meat cleaver to fight. You have no honor. All night you've been running around these fuckin' woods with the advantage. All of you have weapons. Well, why don't you show me, show the fuckin' world, that's what you want, show the fuckin' world that you are who the fuck you say you are. Drop the fuckin' weapons. Just me and you. Fight me one on one. - You guys believe this guy? - Barabbas, you gonna let him talk to you like that? You're afraid to fight this pussy hand to hand? - I think he's kinda scary a little, Barabbas. - What's the matter, you afraid, Barabbas? Come on, Barabbas, we're waiting! - Well. Wasn't anything I had in mind but I think this might be better. Yeah, I think this will really add more hype for next year's game. Well son, I told you you had balls but I questioned your heart. Show me your heart, kid. Yeah, Dean, get it! - Yeah, Dean. - What's up, Dean? Come on, Dean, is that all you got! - Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean! - Come on, Dean, yeah! Yes! - All right, Dean! - Dean! - You could do it. Fuckin' finish him off. Come on, Dean! Don't quit now! - I don't get it, Dean, why didn't you finish it? Come on, Dean. Dean, finish him, what are you doing? Fucking finish him off! Come on, Dean, what the hell, man? - Dean. - Finish it! - Now's your time, Dean. Now's time to prove that you have heart. To prove I have one though, I'll go first! Now's your turn, Dean. Let's see if you have heart. - Dean, Dean, Dean! - No, no heart. - Mother fucker! Fuck! - Grab it! It's a knife! - Pick it up, come on! - What are you doing, just grab the knife! Loose knife. Someone's gettin' fined. - Grab the knife, now, now! - Asshole! You're on probation. You ain't supposed to be killin' anybody yet. - Fucking bitch! - You still feel pain, Griffin. Only when you disconnect the pain will you take one step closer to being one of us. Message boards are bringing our kind together, Lainie. Griffin wants to be one of us. Not looking like he's gonna get the keys to the kingdom anytime soon. - Griffin? - My name isn't Griffin! That's the best name you could come up with for me? Fuckin' Griffin? Come on! - It's a scary world when serial killers come together. Isn't it, Lainie? God bless the worldwide web. - Now this leaves only you. I promise, these next five minutes will be the most terrifying moments of your life. - Stand down, Jezebel. - What, why? General's orders. She's needed for next broadcast. - Ah, isn't that sweet? We get to keep her. - Next year, how are we gonna do this again next year? - General already funded next year's broadcast. The script is already written. I'm gonna guess a website is out of the question for next season. - I like this job. I can't wait to come back next year. - You hear that, sweet thing? We got a role for you for next year's broadcast. You're gonna love it. - Who's controlling this broadcast? - What the fuck is goin' on? You're intel, come on! - What if this isn't it? What if there are more of them out there and we just haven't seen them all yet? - We put the fear back into Halloween. Wanna know something that's even more scary? In a few minutes this broadcast will end. We will take off our masks and walk among you for the next year. Next season, we're bringing in the firepower.
