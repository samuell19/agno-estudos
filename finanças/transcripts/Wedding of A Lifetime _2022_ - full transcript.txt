- I did it anyway. - I didn't. - Oh, my. We're all here. - Yeah. It has been too long since we all got together. Yeah. It has. And let's not let that happen again, son. - I'll try not to, Dad. - Awesome. Thanks. Oh. Darby honey, what happened to your engagement ring? I was cooking today so I had to take it off for safekeeping. You thought we forgot, didn't you? Forgot? ♪ Happy anniversary to you ♪ Happy anniversary dear and Jake and Darby ♪ Jake and Darby. ♪ Happy anniversary to you Congratulations. Awful. Anniversary? You got engaged 10 years ago tonight in this very restaurant. Yeah, you don't remember? Huh. That can't be right. No. I remember that night like it was yesterday. Your Mom was so happy when you came and told us. She knew you were a perfect match. - Absolutely. - And she was right. - Thank you, guys. - Yeah. - This was very special. - Sure. Yeah, it's really sweet, but... Soon you'll have another day to celebrate. But we should really celebrate every day though, right? - It's true. - Right. Yeah. - Should we eat it? - Yes! Yes, please. Let them eat cake. And we did. And we will. Ok, who wants the first piece? Whitney didn't look very happy tonight. Yeah, well she can't be pleased with only four tables. I hope things pick up. Dad's trying everything. Yeah. I'm glad we went tonight. Did you know they had a cake? Of course not. I thought it was just dinner. I would have warned you. How have we been engaged 10 years? Life happened. Your mom died, Rose got sick. Yeah, you got hurt. You started your ski shop. Hey, listen. I still gotta do some inventory at the shop tonight so, if I work too late I'll just sleep there, okay? No, no. You don't have to do that. No, you gotta film in the morning, I don't want to wake you up. Yeah. Yeah, I want to see if I can maybe grab the breakfast crowd. Right. - Sleep well. - You too. Hmm. Now doesn't this look delicious? Mm! And it's even better than it looks. And 70 percent less calories and fat. Just pair it with a couple of eggs and you've got yourself the perfect breakfast. So, come on, give us a follow and I will send you, mm, our secret recipe. Yeah, um, well that's all the time we have for today, thank you so much for watching Scientific Southern Cooking. Yep. I am so sorry. I thought you might want a coffee before class It's ok. I had all of 30 people watching. Oooh! You're up 40 percent. Nice! Yeah, well thank you for the positivity and the coffee. You're welcome. But um, I think I'm gonna have to close up the kitchen. What? Yeah, there's nobody watching. Oh good. My one comment is "your kitchen is as fake as the chicken." - Ugh. - Well, that's nice. Well, I still can't believe how real it looks. Yeah, well... Not real enough. You can't quit. This food is too good. Carla, I've been at this for almost two years. I can't seem to get any traction. You've worked so hard and just need a break. Look, things are gonna change and you'll help so many people be healthier. Trust me. Hope springs eternal, right? - Good morning, Ms. Sinclaire. - Good morning! Anyways, I'll see you in the lunchroom at 12:30PM. Ok. Make sure you bring the rest of these, ok? - Ok. - Ok, thanks. - Bye! - Thanks. Bye! - Hey. - Hey. How'd it go? Oh, well, 30 viewers and they know my backdrop is fake. I saw the show. I thought the chicken looked great. So I had 29 viewers. I count. Oh! Gotcha! What are you doing here? Dude, it's Pandas vs. Preachers, we planned this a week ago. That's tonight? I actually forgot... Ah... you're grilling. - You almost had me going there. - I did. I... I, uh, I have some papers to grade so you guys have fun. Enjoy. See you later, Darb'. Alright. Let's go! We got 20 minutes to game time, what you thinking? Everything alright? The shop only had like 10 customers today. Is that ok? No. That's not good. Maybe Wednesday's meeting will fix that. Since when do you pay attention to my dad's meetings? - Hey, Dad! - Good morning! Morning. - You want breakfast? - Oh, no thank you. Just wanted to see how Nana's doing. Alright. - Hi, Nana. - Hi, honey. How are you feeling? Oh, I'm just fine. Well a little tired but the doctor says that's normal. Are you sure? All my tests are clear. Now, quit fussing over me. You love it when I fuss over you. Well, maybe a little. Batter up! Oh. Making mom's pancakes? She always said that pancakes on Wednesday would get you through the week. Right, except it's Tuesday. Well, it was a long Monday. Want some? Hm. Ok. I'll have one. Fine, maybe two. Alright. Aw, that's a great shot. They always knew they were meant for each other. This house was their dream. And... creating all of this together and having you just made things all the more perfect. Dreams, yeah. I remember when I had those. I was gonna move to New York and open a restaurant. Revolutionize what people thought of southern cooking. Well, you still can. I don't know. It just feels so far away. Impossible, almost. It may be closer than you think. What do you mean? Oh, I don't know. What do you know? Hi. - Hey, Mom. - Oh hey! What's up? Ah, your father sent me to all the stores to remind them of the town meeting this Wednesday morning. What's that about? He wants to talk about bringing in more tourists for the fall and build towards the ski season. But everybody is worried, businesses are down across the board. - And he's taking it on himself. - Mmmhmm. Is there anything I can do? Well, you're a good son for always supporting him, and for being there at 7:00AM sharp with your lovely fiancée. We'll be there. Honey, are... are you ok? You and Darby seemed a little down last night. We realized we've been engaged 10 years. It's kind of hit us hard. Where did all the time go? Well, you had a lot thrown at you. I still get mad when I think about your accident. Oh, Mom, there's no reason to get mad. We all knew the risks. Plus, I got this really cool bolt out of it. Yeah, but you were going to the Olympics. Mom, it is part of the sport. Wednesday. 7:00AM. Sharp. - Ok. - Ok. Hey. Hi. Better day? It was a day. But Dad and Nana are good, so... That's good. I think we should talk. I don't think this is working for either of us. I've had the same feeling. Somewhere along the way we just... We lost our magic. And 10 years was gone. You were amazing when I got hurt. And you were so amazing when Nana got sick. It's like... We spent so much time taking care of everyone else. We forgot about us. I know you've always wanted to try living in a new city and I don't want to hold you back anymore. And if this ski season isn't any better, I'm gonna have to start making some decisions of my own. You're my best friend. And you're mine. I don't know how we do this. We'll always be there for each other, no matter what. So what do we do? I can sleep at the shop, 'til we figure it out. What about our family? Do we just ease them into it? No. My mom will figure it out in like five minutes. Yeah, that's probably true. We'll tell them after breakfast tomorrow. - Can I have a hug? - Please. What's going on here? I don't know, maybe we're early. What is this? - Mom said it was important. - Oh. - Hey. - Hi. - What? - What? Why would these guys be here? Hey Good Day? Surprise! Surprised? Surprised? Yeah. What is all of this? We're on national television. Oh. Don't worry, Darby. You look gorgeous. Is the president here? Un-huh, this is all about you. Follow us. I'm Sarah, producer for Hey Good Day. We air in one minute. Can we... Do you think you could tell us what's going on here? You'll know more in about 40 seconds. Uh... If we could pose chairs set to look more at the screen? Oh, ok. Hey, everybody, we're live with New York in 10 seconds. Three, two... And we're back live in New York City on this sunny fall morning. I'm Vic Baldwin and this is my amazing wife and co-host, Molly Hart and you're watching America's number one morning show, Hey Good Day. Now, if you're just tuning in, we've surprised Jake Johnson and Darby Sinclaire here in Abbottville, North Carolina. Hello Abbottville! Sounds like a great crowd. Yeah. Jake Johnson and Darby Sinclaire, you are our final couple in Hey Good Day's Wedding of a Lifetime competition! Um... I didn't know we entered. - Did we enter? - Mm-mm. Actually, it's a first for us. You were nominated by the entire town. Now, let's take a look at how it all came together. Well, Darby and Jake grew up about a half mile from each other. They were close right from the start. Our families drew so much joy from your accomplishments. These last few years weren't easy on them. Darby and Jake, they were my rock when I was going through a few health issues. Helping pay my medical bills and putting their own plans on hold. So we all got together to nominate you for Hey Good Day's Wedding of a Lifetime. We want Jake and Darby to have the wedding of their dreams because they've brought us so much joy. That is just beautiful. High school sweethearts who stuck together through the tough times. Just like us, honey. Oh, well. My high school sweetheart was the star quarterback. Lex was his name. Or was it Flex? Real nice, dear. We'll be back in a moment to talk with the happy couple. And clear! Great energy, everybody. Alright, we are back live with Molly and Vic in four and a half minutes. You two ok? Could you just excuse me a minute? Can I... Sure. Take as long as you need as long as it's not longer than four minutes. - This is great. - It's great, yeah. It's great. It's great. I'm just gonna... Um... Come on! Follow them. Darb, Darb! So, how psyched are you? So psyched! - This is a big deal. - Huge. The competition gets millions of viewers. - Yeah. Millions? - Millions. It's insane. That's insane. I know. You're gonna be, like, a celebrity. I'm gonna be a celebrity. Darby? Darb, Darb? Oh, they're live, look. Oh! What are we gonna do? Well, at least we don't have to pay for our wedding. Listen, we need to tell everyone right now. Uh... Three minutes. I can't crush our family on national television. What choice do we have? There's gotta be a better way. Oh, ok. Ok. We hit the road, we change our names and we never look back. Or... or... We do the show, lose, and then tell everyone we split up after. What? What? Are you... Wait, are you serious? Why would we ever do that? I think we deserve a little fun. And it'd be a fresh start for both of us. Yeah. It could be good for the town and your shop. And a great way for you to launch your business and grow your followers. And I would love to avoid crushing our family on TV. One minute. I think we deserve a little fun. Do we do it? Let's do it. We are gonna be the most epic losers ever! Let's go. We're ready. And now we'll spin the wheel to see where the competition will be next week. Spin away! Oh look! Chicago! And you'll compete with our three other couples for the Wedding of a Lifetime. You are such naturals for this. Yeah. Absolutely. I love a fall wedding. We should do that next time. We'll see you in Chicago. Should we watch it one more time? Yup. Definitely. No, I think three's enough. Mm-hm. Yeah, and um, it's getting late. You know, we should really get to bed. - It's 6:30PM. - Yeah. Oh. Well, it's been a pretty busy day. Yeah. Well, you should rest up anyway. We're starting competition prep tomorrow. I'm sorry, what? Peggy Appleton and I have watched every year of the competition, so we're gonna train you for a few days. - No. - No. No, that's not necessary. Oh, we're not taking any chances. Mm-mm. The school's given Darby the rest of the week off. - I got the shop though. - Yeah. Gotta work at the shop. I've already got 20 people to cover the store for ya. Really? I don't think I can let you do that, 'cause, it's like, it's super important for me to be there. We're not taking no for an answer. You'll be great at this, you know it. Ok. - One more time. - One more time. Come on, guys. No doodling. There's no time to lose. No. No doodling. Practice makes perfect. Oh, Peggy, hi! - Oh hey! - Hi. Oh, are we early? Oh, no, honey. I was just warming up to lead your workout. Would y'all like a drink first? Oh, that would be great. - Sure. - Thanks, Peggy. - Coming right up. - Come on. Mom, can you tell me again why it is that we're doing this? Ok, she's a little eccentric but she has every episode of the challenge recorded. And, there is a lot of physical challenges. Here we go. My charcoal kale smoothie. - Mmm. - Ok. - Yeah. - Here we go. Mmm. Made something special. - Like blueberries or something. - Special. - Get that in you. - Mm-hm. Oh, oh. Oh dear. Tasty. So good. - So good. - Delicious. - Great. - Yes. Mm-hm. So, where do we get started? Well, after we finish our workout, we can watch season 2. And then we're gonna skip to season 4. Right you are, because that's the best one. By far. How long is this gonna take? I made a highlight reel for each season. The first one is about three hours. - Three hours? - Perfect. - Uh-huh. - Wow. Sorry, my, my phone's ringing. Can't hear it because it's on silent. - Three hours? - Mmmhmm. Hey, Carla. Oh, your kidding? What? Oh, my! Ok, I'm gonna be right there. I'm so sorry, I gotta go. It's a science emergency. - Oh! - Yeah, so, anyway. - Ok, then I gotta go too. - No, no. - We'll do this tomo- - No, no. You stay. I'm gonna be right back and I'll catch up. She is right. We can't waste a minute. Exactly. - Give me your drinks. - Yes. Ha, ha. Well-played. Ha, ha! I thought so. I'm getting my skis and I'm going up the mountain. But, wait, wait. There's no snow. Exactly! Ladies, she's all yours. - Have fun, honey. - Yeah. Have fun. Hi, dear! Honey. Hi. What are you guys doing here? Well, Jake thought it'd be a good idea to catch up on what you missed today. Oh, um, so nice. Um, really nice, but I'm good and I'm sure you're exhausted. I'm just getting my second wind. Oh, great. But you know we also don't have a DVD player, so... yeah. Oh, no problem. I got them all digitally converted. She thinks of everything. - It's perfect. - Yeah. Shall we get started? Hi, it's Hey Good Day. Ah! Hello? Jake, the crew's here. What do I do? Stall 'em. Uh, hang on. Just a... just a second. Ow! Hey Good Day here. Morning! Hey! Beautiful day! Hey congrats on the baby! I heard she's a... woah! Send me a bill! You know where I live! Ok, ok, we got this. I don't think anyone's here, Sarah. Ah, ah, ah, ah!!! I'm fine! Coming! Ok, wait. Wait! Good. Hello? Coming! Coming! Yeah. - Morning! - Morning. We were just waking up. Oh, no problem. No problem. Hey, Kelly, get a couple establishing shots of the lovely home here. Mmmhmm. Hi. Great, welcome. Come on in. Yeah. I thought we were meeting at the airport? Oh, we thought we'd surprise you. Yeah, so the audience sees you as you really are. That's... that's really fun. So fun. Yeah, you'll forget we're here before long. Yeah. Excuse me. Oh, yes, the bedroom. Let's start there. What are we doing? ♪ Well it's one big lucky world ♪ ♪ Now, I am with my girl ♪ ♪ Every day is... a happy world ♪ Darby, Jake. Welcome to Chicago. - Hi. - Hey. Alright, you love birds. Let's go. Look at this. This is... this is cool. Welcome to your hotel. Do you have a strategy for winning this competition? Uh, no. Just be ourselves, I guess. Alright, sounds like a good plan. - Mmmhmm. - Right this way. - Hello. - Hi. Are you worried at all? Uh... - Uh, no. - No. Yeah. I'm not worried, are you worried? I'm not worried. Yeah, we'll just like, be ourselves, you know. - Like have fun. - Yeah. Have fun, sounds good. This could be the start of a whole new life. Mmmhmm. Wave to the cameras. Welcome to Hey Good Day. And Molly, I must say you're looking rather chipper this morning. Oh, well I'm just so happy to be in this world-class city of Chicago. And, you know, I think this is my favorite time of year. Meeting the couples about to begin their journey of marriage. First up is Kelsey Simpson and Sam Turner from Boise, Idaho! - Hello! - Welcome. Hi. Welcome, hello! Welcome to the show. Now, I understand you met Sam when he rescued you from a burning building? That's right and it was love at first sight. So, I guess, you could say it was a combustible relationship. - Oooh. - Oooh. Actually, we don't make jokes about fire safety. Oh. Ok then. Well, welcome to the show. Our next couple is Jake Johnson and Darby Sinclaire from Abbottville, North Carolina. - Hello! - Welcome. Thank you! Now, Jake, you used to be a junior Olympian skier. Yes, I did and now I own my own ski shop. Oh, a lot of tall mountains to climb? Oh no, just lots of perfect runs down the slopes of life. Ah, I wish we could all say that. Have a seat. Thank you so much for being here. Next up is Thomas Best and Grace Hamill, from Phoenix, Arizona. - Hi! - Welcome. Welcome. Tom's in furniture sales and she's a nanny. Thomas, maybe we should talk after the show. I'm looking for a new bed and mine seems a little cramped these days. Awww. Pfft. Ok, I'm sure I can help you with that. Oh, no, no, no. He's just joking. He'll have plenty of room on the couch tonight. Anyway, let's meet our final couple. Marcy Lopez and Larry Chang from right here in Chicago. - Welcome to the show. - Hello. So, I'm curious. Do you think you'll have a hometown advantage? I definitely hope that everyone in this great city will support us. - Oh! - Welcome to the show. We'll get to know all of you during today's show. And then you'll compete in your first challenge. Stick around, we'll be right back. This must be such a big change for you guys. How so? Well, you're from such a small town. I think, um, our building has more people. Nah, it's actually great. We like it. Yeah, we're good. It's a great place to be from. There's something to be said for living in the city. It toughens you up. I think we'll be fine. Oh, you'll do great. They need that demographic. I'm just gonna take a minute here. What did I say? Look, she's just trying to psych us out. Well, it's working. Well, don't forget the reason why we're here. We're supposed to be enjoying the moment. Well, I just don't know if we thought this through, with neither one of us like losing. Ok, am I gonna have to disqualify the two of you? What? No. Why? - Just kidding. - Oh... We got a show to make. Let's go. Follow me, folks. - I didn't even get to eat. - Just start eating now. - Ok. - Just get it in. Jake, tell us about the accident. Oh, uh... Molly, it was the worst day of my life. Um... 12 years of intense training, and blood, sweat and tears and in an instant it was all over. I woke up in the hospital and Darby was by my side. There were months of rehab for my ankle, for my knee. And she was with me every step of the way. In fact, I literally couldn't walk without her. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Just like he's been there for my family. Wow. Thank you for sharing that. America got a chance to know all of you. Now, it's time to find out which couple we'll be saying goodbye to. Our first challenge today is the egg dash. Now, one of you will be blindfolded, carrying a spoon with an egg on it. Well your partner will be on the sidelines coaching you through the course. And just like in marriage, you're bound to break some eggs. But if you drop yours and it doesn't break, you can pick it up and keep going. In a marriage you need to be able to depend and trust on one another. And, for some final fun, you need to weave in and out of these lovely traffic cones sticking to the green line. But, good news, two of the eggs have been hardboiled, so you might get lucky and have a serious advantage. Now, everybody, go ahead. Choose your eggs. Alright, Darb. Come on, pick a good one. A good one. You got this, babe. Once you got your eggs, step back up on the platform. Yes, baby, yes! Get ready. Alright, Jake. Deep breaths. On your mark... Center yourself. You got this. Get set, go! - Go! Ok. And red team is first out of the gate. Look at them. Goodness, can you feel the excitement. This is fantastic. And yellow team seems to be lagging behind a little bit. Let's keep an eye on them. Yeah, I know. This is the real deal. This takes skill. There's no room for amateurs out there. This guys is in your way. Oh, and the green team has dropped their egg. They are disqualified. That's too bad. They're out of it. Turn left, hard left! Did it break? Did it break? No, you're fine. It didn't break. Pick it up and keep going. Got it! Oh, the blue team has dropped their egg but it's a hard-boiled egg. - It's a hard-boiled. - So they picked it up. They're still very much in this game, Molly. The red team seems to be in last place. I wonder if they're going to make it. Yellow team is lost. Looking for some help from the sidelines. It's a costly mistake. This could force them to lose. There's some drama. There's some drama happening. That's fantastic. Ok. Walk, walk, walk. Oh, and the red team has lost their egg. Yes! Yes! - Blue team wins! - Yes! - We did it! - Yes! We did it! We have a winner. Congratulations, team blue. Argh! So, Darby, you seemed to know which egg was hardboiled. Well, it's just science. So, if you spin them, a hard boiled egg spins much faster than a raw one. Huh! Well, it must be good to have a teacher on your side, right Jake? It sure is, Molly. Now, that knowledge puts you in the lead with 25 points. Yes! Up next: It's time to play Pop the Question. We'll ask 15 questions and let's see who answers the most correctly. Let's get the headphones on the men and then we'll take a check on today's weather. Well, it was great to meet you. Have a safe trip home. Ok, her favorite country? France? Favorite café? The Bean. What is Darby's favorite movie? Alien. Her morning coffee. Purple? Christmas! Uh, Taylor Swift. Adele. Grease. Correct! Star Wars. Incorrect. Have you met Grace before this week? I... uh... First boyfriend? Me. Correct. Favorite time of day? Sunset. Correct. Favorite thing about you? My smile. Correct. Favorite gift? Silver bangle bracelet. Correct! And where does she hide the- Oh. You are the only couple to receive a perfect score. - Yes! - Congratulations! Well, that concludes our game. And now it's time to say goodbye to one of our couples. But, we like you all too much. Everyone is safe today. That's right. You all earned a special reward for all your hard work today. It's a night out to enjoy Chicago's famous deep dish pizza, courtesy of Hey Good Day. We'll see you tomorrow! Here they come. Hi, guys. Hey. How does it feel to finally have a chance at your dream wedding... - So good, so good! - Bye. Ok, ok, what made you do it? Was it Larry? Oh, who cares about Larry? It felt great just to win again. You were so good. Why didn't you make up your answers? I don't know. I guess I wanted to see what you knew. I know you. So what do we do now? Maybe we stay in for a round or two. No sense on giving up on the fun just yet. - Great. I can do that. - Ok. Um, I'm... I'm actually pretty exhausted. 5:00AM is just wrong. I know you have the bed tonight but do you mind if I crash for a bit? No, absolutely. It's all yours. Ok, thank you. The couch is comfy, so it's gonna be fine. Let me... It's actually... it's actually not bad once you get... - Hey, Carla. - Hey, it's me. Hang on a second. Bad reception. Hey, you there? Uh... Ok. Yeah. Hi! Hey, hey, congrats! Y'all killed it out there. Oh, thanks. And you already have 30,000 followers on ViewltPics. Are you serious? - Yes! - Oops, gotta go. I love you. Thank you for calling! Bye! Well, I hope our couples all enjoyed the best pizza in the city and the beautiful Millennium Park. We're taking it outside for this gorgeous fall day. They'll have some work to do because today one couple will go home. Now, behind this curtain is a challenge for the mind and body. They'll need to be smart, strong and they'll need to work together. Just like a great marriage, right Molly? So I've heard. Now, we all remember the fun we had at field day every spring, well this is our twist on that. Welcome to the Autumnal Rumble. They'll face off in some fun and exciting challenges and they have to do it all as a team. Let's go! This next game is all about keeping your balance as life throws obstacles your way. You'll start at opposite ends of the balance beam and walk towards each other. Once you meet in the middle, you must switch sides and get to the opposite end. If you step off the beam, you lose. Fastest time wins. And, as they navigate the four-inch wide beam, the other teams will be doing our version of a bouquet toss and try to knock them off as they cross. Welcome to Life Balance. Let's go. Good job. Four, three, two... Now, we can see the yellow team is really taking their time here. Yeah, everything takes balance and poise. But you just can't go too slow. Now, they've reached for each other, they've made contact. Just going to try to cross each other now. Coming out left, right and center. That is really tough to put up with. He's made it across. Team yellow seems to have made it. But boy, oh, boy, are they taking their time. Anytime now team yellow. Oh, and they made it. Well congratulations to them. Slow and steady may win this race. Okay. Next we have team green Vic. Let's see how they do. You gotta stay calm, you gotta stay focussed- Oh, my gosh they're fast, aren't they? - Look at that. - Look at them. Now, they just have to get around each other... oh! - Too bad. - And they're down. But they're laughing. Yup. I think they just got distracted, Molly. That's romance here folks. Hey. We treat it just like we're skiing. - Feet shoulder width apart. - Ok. Bend your knees for balance, lean forward and then we just slide across the beam. Got it. Now here we have team blue. Now, would you look at the technique they're doing. There's a lot of poise and grace there. It's almost as if they've practiced, Look at that. You got this. We got this. What do we do now? Now, here is the important part. Oh! Jump. Oh, right into his arms. Well, that's a romantic move. Right into his arms. Absolutely. That's beautiful. It's almost like a dance. Like a pas de deux. Do you know what pas de deus is, Vic? Yes I do, Molly. It's from the Nutcracker. It's a ballet, if you will. I heard you. They're like real dancers, dancing right in front of our eyes. It is beautiful. - And they made it. - Oh, my goodness. Yes! ha, ha! So, so happy for them. Woo! Ow! - Wait, what just happened? - I'm fine. - You ok? - Yeah. This challenge will test how well you handle it when it feels like the ground is disappearing underneath your feet. Because it will be. Stick around for the drop. Um... That's pretty good. Hey Molly, can I speak to you privately for a moment? We're gonna have to sit out the next round of competitions. Jake. um... Jake has an old injury that just... that he just tweaked. Oh no! This probably disqualifies us, right? Oh. And we're rolling in five, four, three, two... What was that about? As we near the end of the Autumnal Rumble, we have to unfortunately say goodbye to Thomas and Grace. You're such a lovely couple. Thank you so much for competing with us. Thank you, guys. And Vic, we have an update. Now, Vic, Jake and Darby will not be participating in the next leg of the competition because as it turns out, Jake has an old injury that's been acting up. Now, as you know, here at Hey Good Day, we take health and safety very seriously. Absolutely. But I have a surprise! Jake, Darby... you've just been voted fan favorites! Can you believe it? Which means, you get to stay and play another day. You're safe! Ah-ha! Jake! Da! We'll see you all tomorrow, alright? Um, text us if you want to go out later. A crew needs to be with you if you want to go out tonight. We'll be stationed in the lobby. Sounds good. You should have trusted me. There's nothing wrong with my ankle. It was swollen. You did it again. Just like when I got hurt and you wanted me to quit racing. I was worried about you. I saw how much pain you were in. Admit it. You wanted me to quit racing. Jake, I would never ask you to give up your dreams. Oh. Oh, I get it. Like, like when I asked you to stay in Abbottville. I made my own choice to stay. This is getting confusing for both of us. Maybe we should just bow out. Hey, Chip. What's up, buddy? Hey, man. Thought you'd want to know the shop is packed today. Everybody coming in, they saw you on the show and they loving you. That's great. Yeah, and we started a list. People want to take lessons at your ski school. I don't... I don't have a ski school. Yeah, but I think you should probably start one. Who's watching the shop? Yeah, you know what? I should get back inside. Yeah, that might be a good idea. Keep doing what you're doing, bro. Looks like you're having the time of your life. Everything ok? Everything ok? The biggest chef in the country just followed me. What? She messaged me to say she's impressed with Scientific Southern Cooking. That's amazing. She wants to meet me in New York when all this is over. We should go out and celebrate. Tonight. Just us. Should we alert the crew? - No. - No. We're not telling the crew. No. Come on, come on, let's go. Okay, okay, get down, get down. Keep it flat. Keep it flat. Breathe. Get up! Get up, get up, get up. Let's go. It's open, let's go. Quick. Come on! Ahhhh!!! What are you doing? Go around! Around! Come on! Come on, let's go. Careful! Little movements. Okay. Like you want to go small, small. No, not slow. The slower we go the worse, the worse. - The slower we go the worse. - Ah! Woah, woah, woah, slow down. Stop. Just stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Why am I driving this bike? Do you remember that bike you fixed up for me when we were kids? Oh yeah. I even cut the middle bar off because you hated it so much. You tried to paint it. I did. And then the first time it rained, it just washed everything off. I was so mad. So pretty. So, New York, huh? That's going to be great. Yeah. Yeah, but who knows if it'll even happen, right? Oh, you'll make it happen. Well, I don't know. I mean, there's a lot to consider. There's my students and Nana, and our families... You've worked hard for this. You deserve it. And what about you? You've always wanted to expand the business. There's a lot to consider. Like what do I charge, insurance... I do... I do think I'd make a pretty good instructor though. You would make a great instructor. - Hungry? - Always. You wanna go get some dinner? I have a better idea. Thank you. Ok, we're good, we're good. Now, it is time for your next challenge. You may remove the blindfold. We're having pie for dinner? We're having pie for dinner. Yes! I've always wanted pie for dinner. You may have mentioned that a few hundred times. Ah! And honestly, this is the best pie in the city. - Oh wow! - Yes. - That, that's really good. - Mmmhmm. - Did you try the apple? - Mm. I love apple. Apple and then pumpkin. Try the pumpkin. Hm? I don't know... I actually think your pumpkin's better. You better say that. - I'm just speaking the truth. - Yeah? Yours is better. Hey, I'm sorry about earlier. Nothing to be sorry for. I know you just want what's best for me. Yeah, I know you want the same for me. So we keep going? Yeah. One more day. Maybe we can help Sam and Kelsey win. Yeah. - Why not, right? - Yeah. Boop. That's a good look. Wipe it off. Wipe it off. Wipe it off. Get it. Good morning, everyone. How is everyone feeling after the Autumnal Rumble? It's quite the workout! Well, today we'll decide our two finalists. Our first competition showed how well you know each other. Then, we tested how you work as a team. But every couple needs to fight through the tough times. Each couple will be given a jousting lance. The couple that's knocked off their individual platforms will be eliminated. The final two couples will square off for a fabulous prize. And for some added fun, the ring will be filled with bubbly, frothy foam. Welcome to our version of the frosting fight. - Yeah! - Yes! Ok. I got Marcy, you get Larry. Let's take 'em down. Now, Vic, this is the game I've been waiting for. They're smiling now, but just give them five minutes. Very focussed, Vic. Oh, yellow takes a big knock to the head, he's down. That's too bad for team yellow. They still have one player though. Oh, team blue is taking no prisoners. That's right. He has come to play. - Oh, team red! - She's very- Team blue is celebrating. It might be too early. Team yellow is still very strong. Oh! Oh, I spoke to soon. Just lost two people... Team red still has a member. Team blue has two. Team blue is down, taking a huge tumble. It is so slippery out there. Team red seems very sure of himself. Let's see how he fairs against team blue. And team red goes down! We have a winner! So, what happened out there? We tried our best but it was just so slippery. Oh, well that's a tough one. Thank you so much for being here, we loved meeting you both. - Yeah. - Take care now. - Bye. - Buh bye. Jake, Darby, for winning this competition, you'll receive $10,000 What?! To help get you started on your newly-wedded life. Yes! So now, we have our finalists. It's our high school sweethearts vs. Chicago's hometown hopes for the Wedding of a Lifetime. We have invited both couples' families down here to the set to spend some time with them before the finals. Well, what a beautiful sight to see. Join us tomorrow on Hey Good Day where one of these amazing couples will win the Wedding of a Lifetime. And wrap. I'm going to have the chocolate. I've never had a pie brunch! It's kind of our thing now. We are so proud of you both. And everyone back home is watching every moment. Plus, you won $10,000! - So amazing. - Yeah. But honestly, we're happy whatever happens next. Oh, you're definitely gonna win. Tell 'em, honey. Couples from the South have won five out of the last seven seasons. But the winner is just the team who wins the final competition. No. It goes to viewer vote after the last challenge. A viewer vote? Did you read any of the training manual? Yes. Well, if you did, you'd know that the last challenge is a real doozer. Oh, don't worry, Darby. They're definitely gonna pick you. Mm. So, we could really win this thing? Definitely. Don't get too confident. A lot can happen. Maybe we could find just a bit of time, just us, after the sightseeing. Yeah, that sounds good. You know I was just having some fun with you. - I looked at your ViewltPics. - You did? - Carla helped me look at it - Ok. Before we left. - That makes more sense. - 200,000 followees? Followers. Oh, I wish your mother was here. She is looking down right now and she is so proud. I hope so. I know so. Yeah. Jake's been pretty amazing. Hold onto each other and everything will work out fine. Thanks, Nana. Hey. What's all this? I thought we should celebrate. - To us. - To us. Well this has been a crazy experience, huh? Yeah. Yes. It's been wild. It has. What are we gonna do about tomorrow? I think we just figure that out tomorrow. These last few days have been amazing. They really have. And I think it's exactly what we needed. Yeah. And look at all the great things that are happening. I know, it's incredible. But, I mean, all of this isn't, it's not real. Everything I felt this week was real. Everything. Everything I felt... was real too. I miss you. Oh, Jim! I told you that we were gonna be interrupting. Sorry, son. I thought the note meant to meet here. You didn't take the note off the door? I didn't take the note. I promised I'd take them to a steak dinner. My mom looked this place up online. No, no, your mom and I will go. You... We don't want to interrupt. - Just go. - Do you want to come? No, no, no, it's fine. And I could really, I could really use some extra rest. - Ok. - Ok. Ok. Go, go, have fun. It's ok. Thanks, Dad. Alright everyone, listen up. We are at the finish line. What time do we go on? You're on at the top of the hour for the final competition and then we start the voting. And when do they announce the winner? At the end of the show. So, take a moment, get ready and we'll head to set. Just be yourselves out there and it'll all come together. They seem to kiss a lot, on these shows. Maybe a kiss or two. We'll try, Nana. Jake, seriously, cry if you can. Whatever happens, we're happy. You know, it's... It's been an amazing experience. Make sure you say that. The audience love it. It has! Perfect. - Come on. - Come on. Ok. Come on. Ok, Mom. Oh wow. Is not going to slow her down. I just want to say you're all winners in our books. That's right. And did you know that our ratings are up - 16 percent over last year? - Mmmhmm. Wow. Thirty seconds to air, everybody. - Ok. - Ok. Hey, I got you no matter what. - Ok? - Ok. Jake, Darby. I got you. Five seconds, clear the set. Live in five, four, three, two... And we're back. We brought in some of our biggest fans for today's show. The families of Jake and Darby and Marcy and Larry are joining us today, welcome! We'd also like to thank you, Chicago, for treating us so well this week. Oh, well it has been an intense few days for our couples but we have two amazing finalists! Are you ready for the final competition? America, get ready to vote. We'll announce our winner at the end of today's show. We wish both couples could win the Wedding of a Lifetime. We just can't do that because we don't have enough sponsors. Now, is there anything anyone would like to say before we get started? Whatever happens, this has been the chance of a lifetime, so we're blessed. Oh, well that is so sweet. Yes. For Declare Yourself, one person from each couple will tell the world why he or she would get engaged all over again. But fate will decide who speaks. Jake and Darby, you're up first. Tails, Darby goes. Heads, Jake. And it's Jake. Darby, this competition has made me realize that nobody has a relationship like ours. Nobody. I have had the honor of knowing you most of my life. And I love the life that we've built. It's a life that is filled with love and with our friends and with our family. And I don't want to do that life without you. I know that I have asked you to put some of your dreams on hold but I promise right here and right now that I will do everything I can to make sure that your dreams come true. And whatever happens, I'm standing here today, promising to always be by her side and I hope she'll always be by mine. Babe!? Honey, honey, are you ok? What just happened? You passed out for a few seconds. It was more like 30 seconds. Don't worry, no one noticed. How would no one notice? Marcy botched her speech. Thank you. I filmed all of it, do you want to see it? No, I'll trust you. Listen, there's... there's something we need to talk to you about. Do you two want some time alone? - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. What did you just do? You said speak from the heart. Yeah, but there's so many things, I've got, like, my hair, it needs highlighting, like what's going on, right? And my skin, I need an enzyme peel in New York. There's like the chicken and the cooking and the... this is all just happening so fast. Huh? Fifteen years is fast? Look, we've both been through so much hurt the last few years but we can still make our dreams come true. We... Do you want to try? Of course. We need to film a couple of things with the whole family while we wait for the vote. You ready? I'm ready. So, is everyone ready to hear who won? We're ready, Molly! It was a huge vote. We had two million voters in just two hours. The envelope, please. - Oh, boy. - Phew. And the winners are... Jake Johnson and Darby Sinclaire! Oh, my gosh! - Hello! - Great job! Oh, honey. Because America fell in love with everyone from Abbottville, we have one final surprise. That's right, we are bringing your wedding of a lifetime to your hometown! You'll get married in five days, surrounded by all your family and friends. And four million people will watch every moment. Four million? - Yeah. - Four million. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you in Abbottville. Now, does it feel real yet? It does now. Good. Now, we've got only three days to get a lot of business done, so let's have fun while we do it, ok? Ok. This is so exciting! Now, we've got a lot to do in a short amount of time, so, we got you a wedding coordinator. Oh. He's the stylist to the stars, Sebastian Star! - Darb! Can I call you Darb? - Of course! It is so exciting to meet you. I've been on the edge of my seat the entire competition. Can I just tell you how much I love you on your show? Oh, thank you. And I voted for you like 50 times. So, are you ready to see your first two dresses? I am. - Wow. - Oh, my goodness. Did you just say "oh my goodness?" I did. Oh, you are so sweet.

Three, two... We're live from Abbottville, North Carolina and it is the day before the wedding of a lifetime. Sebastian, come on out. So, did the audience make some good choices? They made some great choices and we averaged three million votes a day. - Wow. - Well, let's see 'em. Here it comes, thank you. So, our audience chose this spectacular traditional tux for Jake. It's beautiful. You're gonna look so handsome. You know, maybe I should get one too. It's a tuxedo, honey, it's not magic. I still believe in magic. Jake, what do you think of the tux? I... I was actually hoping for the powder blue one, but this one will be great. Oh, oh and look. Here are the centerpieces and floral arrangements. It's gonna look so beautiful. We're gonna give you viewers the event of a season. And let's look at the final piece of the puzzle, the wedding dress. Oh, no. I have to save something for tomorrow. America and Jake will see the dress at the same time. Oh, well. It's true. It's bad luck for the groom to see the wedding dress before the big day. Trust me, I know. Tune in for the Wedding of a Lifetime. Right now we'll send it back to New York for the updates in the news. Don't go away. And we're clear. Good show, folks. - We'll see you both tomorrow. - Ok. - Have a good sleep tonight. - Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Oh, careful. - Oh, this is all so exciting. - Isn't it? Ok, so Darby, you'll be staying at your home tonight and Jake, you'll be staying at your parents. We just want to build anticipation for the first time you see each other tomorrow. And what time is our call time tomorrow? Oh, it's a late call, only 6:00AM. Oh, good. Only 6:00. Sarah, thank you so much for everything. You've been amazing. Well, you know, don't tell anyone, but you two are my favorite couple ever. - Do you have to say that? - Yeah. Cut, cut the cameras. Cameras aren't rolling, so you can trust me. Oh. Jake, don't try to sneak back over here. I have a sixth sense for any funny business. Oh, I promise. I will say my goodbyes and then I will go to my parents' house. I'll see you both tomorrow. This is the first time we've been alone in like four days. Yeah, no, I know. It's... They weren't kidding about the schedule. I thought you two might want a little treat. - It's hot apple cider. - Oh, thank you. That's so nice. Thank you, Whitney. Oh, it's the least I can do. Y'all saved my business. Heck, y'all saved this town. People are coming from all over to find out where Darby and Jake are from. Jim said hotels are booked solid until Christmas. That's great. That's, that's very sweet, but, it's actually the town that saved us. Oh. Well, I should go. Oh! I will see you two tomorrow. I was able to get a ticket to the wedding. Dum, dum, duh duh Dum, dum, duh duh... Woo! Tickets? Yeah. I'm sure it'll be a fun surprise. Hey. Tomorrow is about us. And our ticketed guests. It's a fresh start. I hope so. - Goodnight! - Ok. - You should go. - I'm gonna go. Yeah. Ok. Jake and Darby are getting married. And Jake will be joining us in just a couple of minutes and you're all about to see the Wedding of a Lifetime. So stick around, we'll be right back. Ok, she's almost ready, but brace yourselves though, ok? What? Alright, Darby. Showtime! Well don't keep us in suspense, Darb. Does it fit? Oh, it fits. Yeah. Um... Is this the dress? I don't think this is the dress. There was a last minute change with the sponsor and we have to showcase this dress, but, it is from a world-famous designer and the braids, they are just small-town chic. You look, you look great. Yeah. Ok. Well... Yeah, it's, um, it's great, right? So you like it? You make anything gorgeous. Right. Well, I guess we gotta do it, right? It's, it's what we got. Oh, Darby. You are beautiful. Yeah, stunning. Breathtaking. I mean, it's very runway, right? It's like... - Totally. - Yes, it is. Anyway, we are almost ready, so do you have all your good luck charms? Good luck charms? You know, something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. Got it! Ha, ha! We forgot everything at my house. Or did we leave it at my house? You know what? It's, it's ok. It's really, it's fine. No, no, no we are not tempting fate. Ladies, let's go. I shouldn't have let you keep them. Let's take my car. I remember where we left it. There they are. There's our groom. Hi. Hello. Good morning. Jake, you look a little nervous. Can I ask who they are? Production thought the shot could use some more bridesmaids and groomsmen so we just cast some extras. Uh-huh. They don't have any lines, don't worry. Good to know. None of this matters. What do you mean? Do you know what I remember about my wedding day? Looking into Frank's eyes and everything melting away. That would be, uh, pretty great right about now. When you walk down that aisle, you look for Jake. You won't see anything else. Thank you. Oh. Ok. So we found them but we only have like two minutes, ladies, so let's make this quick. I took care of something old and something borrowed. They were your mother's earrings. She wore them on her wedding day. She wanted you to have them today. Thank you, Nana. Darby, I have something blue. This was really precious to me. Thank you, Kathy. And I got you something new. It's a star hairpin because you're a star. It was just a matter of time. Do you mind if I put it in your hair? Thank you. Thank you all so much for being here right now. I could not imagine this day without you. We're live in three, two... So, Jake, are you ready now to see your wedding of a lifetime. Yes. We think you're gonna love it. Come on in! - Let's get you married. - Oooh. One more small thing. The show wanted you to have a larger bridal party, so you might see a couple extra people up there. Oh. Well, who are they? Just some people we cast for the show. Excuse me a second. - Darby? - What is going on? - Darby? - Where is she going? - Do we have a runner? - I think we do. Yep. Oh no! - I want to marry you. - I want to marry you. Not here though. We can't do it here. What do you mean you can't have the wedding here? Ok. So that morning when you surprised us with this beautiful opportunity, we were actually coming to tell you that we had broken up. We still loved each other, but so much has happened over the last few years and we got lost. Oh, honey. Why didn't you tell us? We didn't want to break your hearts on national television. And you know, I'm not sure that we were completely positive it was over. I mean, we've always been Jake and Darby. We didn't want to disappoint you. You could never disappoint us. We know that now. - Listen- - Let them talk. We thought we were gonna play a few rounds and then go our separate ways after we lost, but... We found each other again. Well, so why did you stop the wedding on live television? We had to be honest with everyone. Well, you told us. So, why don't we get back in there and get this show on the road? It's not the wedding you wanted. It's so beautiful. It's just not us. Yeah. Well, this has been a rather eventful morning. Stay with us, because we'll be right back after this brief commercial message. I still can't believe that you did this. We're so sorry. You gave us the most exciting ending ever. It'll be re-shared forever. You two take care of each other. I mean, they totally changed all my fall ball decor. - I know. - They didn't care! I know. I know. I'm just sorry we made you feel like you couldn't tell us what you were going through. We just put too much pressure on you. Why didn't you come to us? All you did was love us. But we do still need to get married. Yes, we do. What are you thinking? Um, we have something in mind. We're gathered here today for the wedding of Jake and Darby. The happy couple would like to begin by exchanging their vows. Jake. Darby, I love you. You are the most kind and beautiful woman I have ever seen in my entire life. I knew that very first night that I wanted to marry you. It just took me a lot longer than I expected. You stood by me when I couldn't stand on my own. And you supported me like nobody else in this world. But now, it's time for you to follow your dreams. We have two tickets to New York City, leaving in three days. You are gonna take the big apple by storm and I cannot wait to be there cheering you on every step of the way. What? I don't know what to say. Darby. Oh right, um... I have loved you since the day that I met you. You're generous, you're strong. You're so funny. I'm just so happy we're standing here today. It has always, and only ever been you. You are my heart. And I have a present for you too. Yes, um, I found a firm to help build and launch your ski school. Which means you get to share your love of sport with so many people and I'm gonna be right there on this adventure with you. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I love you so much. - I love you so much! - I just want you to be happy. - I am happy with you. Let's, let's slow down a minute. Let's... Let's get you married first. Ah, yes. Jake, please take this ring, place it on Darby's finger and repeat after me. - I Jake, take you, Darby. - I Jake, take you, Darby. - To be my lawfully wedded wife. - To be my lawfully wedded wife. That's it. Darby, place the ring on Jake's finger and repeat after me. - I Darby, take you, Jake. - I Darby, take you, Jake. To be my lawfully wedded husband. To be my lawfully wedded husband. - You're bloated. - I know. I'm sorry. - Here we go. - It's all that pie! It is! By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Yay! You may kiss the bride. - We're married! - We're married! We're married! Congratulations!
