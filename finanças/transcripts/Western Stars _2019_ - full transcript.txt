Western Stars is a 13-song meditation on the struggle between individual freedom and communal life. There are two sides of the American character. One is transient, restless, solitary. But the other is collective and communal, in search of family, deep roots, and a home for the heart to reside. These two sides rub up against one another, always and forever in everyday American life. The barn. We've got a 100-year-old barn on our property built in the late 1800s, and the hayloft is simply a spiritual space. It has a high cathedral ceiling that used to be packed with enough winter hay to reach from the floor to the roof. Since we've had the place, we've held barn dances, weddings, harvest parties up there. So it's a space filled with the best kind of ghosts and spirits. When we knew we were going to filmWestern Stars, due to the instrumentation, I knew we'd need some place that could fit a 30-piece orchestra. Our barn is a structure that speaks to you. Its natural beauty, the artistry of its construction, the aged wood. It's like a fine instrument itself. And it sounds good. It's just got soul. So for a few days, we got to play for a few friends and entertain the horses down below. So come on in, 'cause we're about to start our tale with a man just standing by the roadside.

This is my 19th album and I'm still writing about cars. Writing about the people in 'em, anyway. Why? I don't know. I guess the car remains a powerful metaphor for me. We still live a lot of our lives here in America in cars... just trying to get from one place to another, from one place to another. Now, I suppose 40 years ago, they were a potent metaphor for open roads, freedom. Today, not so much. At best, they're a metaphor for movement. When we're in a car, we can feel like we're always moving forward, over the rise, around the bend, into the future. It can settle the spirit sometimes. But are we moving forward? A lot of the time, we're just moving. ♪ It's the same sad story ♪ ♪ Love and glory Goin' 'round and 'round ♪ ♪ It's the same old cliche ♪ ♪ A wanderer on his way Slippin' from town to town ♪ ♪ Some find peace here On the sweet streets ♪ ♪ The sweet streets of home ♪ ♪ Where kindness falls And your heart calls ♪ ♪ For a permanent place Of your own ♪ ♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ ♪ I drift from town to town ♪ ♪ When everyone's asleep And the midnight bells sound ♪ ♪ My wheels are hissin' Up the highway ♪ ♪ Spinning 'round and 'round ♪ ♪ You start out slow In a sweet little bungalow ♪ ♪ Something two can call home ♪ ♪ Then the rain comes fallin' ♪ ♪ The blues come calling ♪ ♪ You're left With a heart of stone ♪ ♪ Some folks are inspired Sitting by the fire ♪ ♪ Slippers tucked Under the bed ♪ ♪ When I go to sleep I can't count sheep ♪ ♪ For the white lines In my head ♪ ♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ ♪ I roam from town to town ♪ ♪ When everyone's asleep And the midnight bells sound ♪ ♪ My wheels are hissin' Up the highway ♪ ♪ Spinning 'round and 'round ♪ ♪ Where are you now? ♪ ♪ Where are you now? ♪ ♪ Where are you now? ♪ Come on! ♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ ♪ I roam from town to town ♪ ♪ When everyone's asleep And the midnight bells sound ♪ ♪ My wheels are hissin' Up the highway ♪ ♪ Spinning 'round and 'round ♪ ♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ ♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ ♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ ♪ Wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ Wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ Wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ Wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ Wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ I'm a wayfarer, baby ♪ -♪ Wayfarer, baby ♪ Come on, Charlie! Change. How do you change yourself? I've spent my 10,000 hours, and then some, learning my musical craft. But I've spent a lot more time than that, some 35 years, trying to learn how to let go of the destructive parts of my character. They did not go easily into that good night. For a long time, if I loved you and if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could. It was a sin, and I still have days when I struggle with it. But I've gotten better. Through the love of my family, my good friends, I've learned how to love. And to be compassionate with those close to me, and to try and live with some small honor. "Tucson Train" is about a guy who's trying to follow his better angels, working in the sun for a new start. He's trying to change. -One, two, one, two, three, four. ♪ I got so down And out in Frisco ♪ ♪ Tired of the pills And the rain ♪ ♪ I picked up Headed for the sunshine ♪ ♪ I left a good thing behind ♪ ♪ Seemed all of our love Was in vain ♪ ♪ Now my baby's coming in On the Tucson train ♪ ♪ I come here Lookin' for a new life ♪ ♪ One I wouldn't Have to explain ♪ ♪ To that voice That keeps me awake at night ♪ ♪ When a little peace Would make everything right ♪ ♪ If I could just Turn off my brain ♪ ♪ Now my baby's coming in On the Tucson train ♪ ♪ Well, we fought hard Over nothin' ♪ ♪ We fought Till nothin' remained ♪ ♪ I've carried that nothin' For a long time ♪ ♪ Now I carry My operator's license ♪ ♪ And spend my days Just runnin' this crane ♪ ♪ My baby's coming in On the Tucson train ♪ ♪ Hard work'll clear Your mind and body ♪ ♪ The hard sun Will burn out the pain ♪ ♪ If they're lookin' for me Tell 'em, buddy ♪ ♪ I'm waitin' Down at the station ♪ ♪ Just prayin' To the five-fifteen ♪ ♪ I'll wait All God's creation ♪ ♪ Just to show her A man can change ♪ ♪ Now my baby's coming in On the Tucson train ♪ ♪ On the Tucson train ♪ ♪ On the Tucson train ♪ ♪ Waitin' on the five-fifteen ♪ ♪ Here she comes ♪ Western Stars is the heart of the record. It was my reference point when I was searching for who my character was and where he, I, was headed. You've got a fading Western film star watching the world change around him. Watching it pass him by. He's left doing Viagra commercials, and weekend rodeoing in the desert, east of Los Angeles, with some Mexicancharros who've come across la frontera. He lives in the Hollywood Hills, frequents LA watering holes, where he's the oldest guy in the room. But he's still got an inner compass that doesn't allow him to bullshit himself. He knows exactly who he is, what he's done, the good, the bad and the ugly of it. It's his small redemption... and he's made a relative peace with himself. He's losing old friends quickly, a lot of empty boots. But he wakes up in the morning, glad that his are still on. ♪ I wake up in the morning ♪ ♪ Just glad my boots are on ♪ ♪ Instead of empty In the whispering grasses ♪ ♪ Down the Five At Forest Lawn ♪ ♪ On the set The makeup girl brings me ♪ ♪ Two raw eggs And a shot of gin ♪ ♪ Then I give it all up For that little blue pill ♪ ♪ That promises to bring it All back to you again ♪ ♪ Yeah, ride me down easy ♪ ♪ Ride me down easy, friend ♪ ♪ Tonight, the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ ♪ Here in the canyons Above Sunset ♪ ♪ The desert Don't give up the fight ♪ ♪ A coyote with someone's Chihuahua in its teeth ♪ ♪ Skitters 'cross my veranda In the night ♪ ♪ Some lost sheep From Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Sips her mojito Down at the Whiskey Bar ♪ ♪ Smiles and says She thinks she remembers me ♪ ♪ From that commercial With the credit card ♪ ♪ Hell, these days There ain't no more ♪ ♪ Now there's just again ♪ ♪ Tonight, the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ ♪ Sundays I take my El Camino ♪ ♪ Throw my saddle in and go ♪ ♪ East to the desert Where the charros ♪ ♪ They still ride and rope ♪ ♪ Our American brothers ♪ ♪ Cross the wire and bring The old ways with them ♪ ♪ Tonight, the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ ♪ Once I was shot By John Wayne ♪ ♪ Yeah, it was Towards the end ♪ ♪ That one scene's bought me A thousand drinks ♪ ♪ Set me up and I'll tell it For you, friend ♪ ♪ Here's to the cowboys ♪ ♪ And riders in the whirlwind ♪ ♪ Tonight, the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ ♪ And the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ ♪ Tonight The riders on Sunset ♪ ♪ Are smothered In the Santa Ana winds ♪ ♪ And the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ -♪ Come on And ride me down easy ♪ ♪ Ride me down easy, friend ♪ ♪ Tonight, the western stars Are shining bright again ♪ ♪ I woke up this morning ♪ ♪ Just glad my boots were on ♪ Saturday night, let's rock and roll!

One more time around, Charles. Come on! -Whoo! In "Drive Fast," I had that metaphor... of the stuntman. Which is always a metaphor of risk, and of, uh, this idea that we all have our broken pieces. What frightens and what exhilarates and inspires us, are often very close together. Those feelings are the essence of what drives us to risk... in life and in love. Everybody's broken in some way. Physically, emotionally, spiritually. In this life, nobody gets away unhurt. I wrote a song about a guy not just finding the fearlessness to do his job, but the fearlessness to risk being with somebody that you love. We're always trying to find somebody whose broken pieces fit with our broken pieces, and something whole emerges. So, it was just a good metaphor for a story like that.

The older you get, the heavier that baggage becomes that you haven't sorted through. So you pay the price. And the older you get, the higher that price is. But in the past, putting yourself on the line, putting your heart on the line, has bred nothing but pain and failure, so you run. I've done a lot of that kind of running. You lose control of your desires, your appetites, your temper, and you reap what you sow. You run until you've left everything that you've loved and loves you behind. ♪ Guess it was somethin' I shouldn't have done ♪ ♪ Guess I regret it now ♪ ♪ Ever since I was a kid ♪ ♪ Tryin' to keep My temper down ♪ ♪ Is like chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ I left my home Left my friends ♪ ♪ I didn't say goodbye ♪ ♪ I contract out to the BLM ♪ ♪ Up on the Montana line ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ We're out before sunup ♪ ♪ We're in after sundown ♪ ♪ There's two men In the chopper ♪ ♪ Two under saddle On the ground ♪ ♪ In the evenings We'd hop in the pickup ♪ ♪ Head into town for a drink ♪ ♪ I make sure I work till I'm so damn tired ♪ ♪ Yeah, way too tired To think ♪ ♪ You lose track of time ♪ ♪ It's all just storms Blowin' through ♪ ♪ You come rollin' 'Cross my mind ♪ ♪ Your hair flashin' In the blue ♪ ♪ Like wild horses ♪ ♪ Just like wild horses ♪ ♪ Just like wild horses ♪ ♪ A fingernail moon In a twilight sky ♪ ♪ I'm ridin' in the high grass Of the switchback ♪ ♪ I shout your name Into the canyon ♪ ♪ The echo throws it back ♪ ♪ The winter snow whites Out the plains ♪ ♪ Till it can turn you blind ♪ ♪ The only thing Up here I've found ♪ ♪ Is tryin' to get you Off my mind ♪ ♪ It's like Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ ♪ Chasin' wild horses ♪ Oh! Sundown. A new day in a new town. I had a gal in New Jersey who broke my heart, ripped it to shreds, trampled on it, and sent it to me, COD, in a paper bag. So, I was out of there, on the first ride west, no looking back. I was going to build a new life in California, 3,000 miles away from the pain. But it didn't, uh, take long before my luck ran out and my money ran out. And it just wasn't gonna happen, so... Well, this song was my shot, my tribute to all the great Jimmy Webb songs about character and place. Here, we find my brother in heartbreak, a long way from home.

It's just about being lost on the highway of life. Lost is something I'm... I'm good at writing about. Sometimes you've been too beat up, or haven't healed enough of the fear out of you, to know a good thing when you've found it. Sometimes you just gravitate to the pain. It's what you're used to. It's how you recognize yourself. It feels like home. It feels more familiar to you than love. So that's where you go. You don't know how to hold onto love, but you know how to hold onto hurt. ♪ Came into town With a pocketful of songs ♪ ♪ I made the rounds But I didn't last long ♪ ♪ I'm out on this highway With a bone-cold chill ♪ ♪ Here, somewhere north of Nashville ♪ ♪ I lie awake In the middle of the night ♪ ♪ Makin' a list of things That I didn't do right ♪ ♪ With you at the top Of a long page filled ♪ ♪ Here, somewhere North of Nashville ♪ ♪ For the deal I made The price was strong ♪ ♪ I traded you for this song ♪ ♪ We woke each morning With hearts filled ♪ ♪ Bluebird of love On the windowsill ♪ -♪ Now the heart's unsteady The night is still ♪ ♪ All I've got's this melody And time to kill ♪ ♪ Here, somewhere North of Nashville ♪ ♪ Here, somewhere North of Nashville ♪ ♪ Here, somewhere North of Nashville ♪ Lies.

That's the perfect ingredient for an epic pop single. Love is one of the only miracles God has given us daily proof of on earth. And while we do our best to disprove this idea, love is there to better us. But you must work for its blessings. Love and the creative life it births is a small, sweet sign of God's divinity within us. Now, my man in this song knows the rules. Works to abide by them. But sometimes our fears, our old habits and our insecurities get the best of the best that's within us.

When Patti and I got together, there was nothing guaranteed. We didn't know where our love was gonna take us. All we had was the next day, and the shaky faith that it would lead us somewhere. We had to sneak around so I'd meet her on the same bench in Chelsea, across from the Empire Diner when I came into New York City. I'd bring some beer in a paper bag and we'd sit and talk. That was the bench I proposed to her on, and where we brought our first son, Evan, and carved our initials into the wood. That was some 30 years ago now. And marriage still doesn't bring along its guarantees. Just the faith and love you have in one another and the next day. ♪ There's a place On a blank stretch of road ♪ ♪ Where nobody travels And nobody goes ♪ ♪ The deskman says These days 'round here ♪ ♪ Well, two young folks could Probably up and disappear ♪ ♪ Into rustlin' sheets A sleepy corner room ♪ ♪ Into the musty smell ♪ ♪ Of wilted flowers And lazy afternoon hours ♪ ♪ At the Moonlight Motel ♪ ♪ Well, the pool's filled With empty eight-foot deep ♪ ♪ Got dandelions growin' up ♪ ♪ Through the cracks In the concrete ♪ ♪ Chain-link fence Half-rusted away ♪ ♪ Got a sign says, "Children Be careful how you play" ♪ ♪ Your lipstick taste And your whispered secret ♪ ♪ I promised I'd never tell ♪ ♪ A half-drunk beer Your breath in my ear ♪ ♪ At the Moonlight Motel ♪ ♪ Well, then it's ♪ ♪ Bills and kids And kids and bills ♪ ♪ And the ringing of the bell ♪ ♪ Across the valley floor ♪ -♪ Through the dusty Screen door ♪ -♪ Dusty screen door ♪ ♪ Of the Moonlight Motel ♪ ♪ Last night, I dreamed Of you, my lover ♪ ♪ And the wind Blew through the window ♪ ♪ And blew off the covers ♪ ♪ Of my lonely bed I woke to something you said ♪ ♪ It's better to have loved Yeah ♪ ♪ It's better to have loved ♪ ♪ As I drove, there was A chill in the breeze ♪ ♪ And leaves tumbled From the sky and fell ♪ ♪ Onto a road so black As I backtracked ♪ ♪ To the Moonlight Motel ♪ ♪ She was boarded up and gone Like an old summer song ♪ ♪ Nothing but an empty shell ♪ ♪ I pulled in And stopped into my old spot ♪ ♪ I pulled a bottle of Jack Out of a paper bag ♪ ♪ Poured one for me And one for you as well ♪ ♪ Then it was one more shot ♪ ♪ Poured out Onto the parking lot ♪ ♪ To the Moonlight Motel ♪ Yeah, let's move on. That was good, Tommy, that was good. But the one last night... You never know what's going to happen with new music. Especially when it's played live. I love collaborating with people from my past. But I also love the challenge of finding and working with new collaborators. Now, during the filmmaking process, we took some chances and a certain kind of magic took place. Just the right amount of mistakes happened. And as you hoped it would, the music began to take on a life of its own... as it bounced around the wooden shell of our old barn. So when the music's over at the end of the day, life's mysteries remain and deepen. Its answers, unresolved. But if your heart is open, and you're thinking hard, and living and loving in good faith, the questions you are asking yourself grow deeper, better. So you walk on in pursuit of those better questions, tentatively putting one foot in front of another through the dark. Because that's where the next morning is. Travel safe, pilgrim.
