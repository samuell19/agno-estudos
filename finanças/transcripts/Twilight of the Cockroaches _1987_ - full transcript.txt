[footsteps pattering] [thumping] [door opens] [door closes] [wind blowing] [door closes] - I beg your pardon, could you help me find a friend of mine please? [screams] Careful, you could've squashed me. [stomps] [screaming] [heavy breathing] [screams] My name is Naomi. I'm a young cockroach, 19 in roach years. In all the time I've lived with my tribe, I've never experienced terror or a single incident of cruelty from our human host. [soft piano music] [soft piano music] [soft piano music] [heavy breathing] - I'm completely wiped out. - You need to spend more time at the gym. They say you'll never get stronger if you don't put in the effort to build yourself up. - I quit the gym. - You quit? What did you do that for? - Too much work, it's a waste of my time. Anyway, what's the point? I'm never gonna be one of those cockroaches who spends his life with his nose to the ground, scrambling around, looking for food. [snorting] - Stop it, Ichiro. You sound just like a pig. [Ichiro laughs] - Listen Naomi, you and I have a lot of things to talk about at dinner tonight, which if Saito's on schedule, should be northern Italian with a delicate tomato and basil sauce. Last night was Chinese, the day before that was steak and potatoes, so if I know Saito, tonight will be pasta. [ice cubes clink] Speak of the devil. [ice cubes clinking] Evenin', Mr. Saito. [ice cubes clink] - Let's go. - Bye. [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [roaches chattering] I went out looking today and I think I found the perfect place for us. The south wall's made of glass so the sun comes in and it's bright and airy. Hanging plants completely cover the ceiling. It's beautiful. I can hardly wait to move in there after we get married. [Naomi groans] Even my father liked it. He said it's a good investment and he'd be glad to help with the payments. What's wrong? Did I say something to upset you? If so, I'm sorry. - No, mm-mm. You're not to blame. It's me. - [Takashi, Parsley, And Yasuo] Hey you two love birds. [upbeat rock music] - So Ichiro, I hear you're on the fast track. A promotion to second assistant? You must've done something special to impress the big boss. - [Ichiro] He was impressed with my father's connections. - Doesn't surprise me, that's how it usually works. Marvelous pasta sauce, it's heaven. Look at those two, we could be eating out of dumpster for all they care. [laughs] - They're missing a great meal. - You can say that again. This ketchup's delicious. - Gee, Takashi, no wonder you never get ahead. You have no taste, no vision, no appreciation of the finer things that make life worth living. - Like good friends, you mean? [upbeat rock music] [chattering] [grumbles] - Good evening. Sorry about the noise, but don't worry, we'll be closed in about 10 minutes. Please, bare with us, Mr. Saito. [upbeat rock music] [chattering] [chattering] - You youngsters are a disgrace. Just take a look at yourselves. You dishonor our cockroach ancestors, stumbling around in the open like this and-- - Now, now, take it easy. You're absolutely right of course, but it's late and we're both tired. I'm sure these folks didn't mean to insult anyone with their behavior. Now straight home everyone, and remember, be careful. [soft music] - [Ichiro] Will you stay with me tonight? [soft music] Please? [insects buzzing] [soft music] - I wish you could be here to see this, Naomi. Soon, it will all come to pass, very soon. - [Kosuke] I know how much this kind of thing upsets you. The whole fabric of our society's unraveling and it's leaving us old timers in the dust, hm? - Oh. Hello Kosuke. - Master, shouldn't you be in bed? Come along with us. It's much too cold for you to be standing around in the night here. If anything should happen to you, this tribe wouldn't know which way to turn. [floor creaking] Hm? [footsteps thumping] You should be in bed yourself, Saito-san. Remember, tomorrow is an important day. [rattling] [Naomi gasps] - Ichiro, wake up! [yelling] [Hans grunting] - Uh, where do you suppose he came from? Do you think he's all right? Um, hello? Hello, are you-- [gasps] - As I stared at him, I knew he was one of them. A roach from the tribe that lived across the field. I had never been there, but I knew all about their society. Grandfather's stories had painted a vivid picture over the years. His world was quite different from mine, a nation in a constant struggle for survival. A permanent battleground where roaches had to prove themselves in daily combat. A truly frightening existence. And yet, I found myself strangely attracted to Hans. He had such an air of mystery and sadness about him. Ichiro would waste no time in turning our visitor over to the authorities for questioning. I think he sensed my interest from the very beginning. [soft music] [child roaches laughing] Ichiro? - Hm? - Tell me what's happened. Have they placed Hans under arrest? - Ah, don't be silly. Why would they do that? I heard they were going to grant him refugee status. The whole affair's very hush-hush, top secret, if you know what I mean. - Did you hear anything about how he was injured? - He's been in combat. - Combat? With a cat? - With a human. [Naomi gasps] - A human like Mr. Saito? Why? - I don't know. I figure he must've done something really terrible to provoke him. Not to change the subject, honey, but have you chosen your wedding dress yet? I don't wanna bug ya, but you're gonna run out of time. - I wanted Parsley to go with me, but she's been busy. - The dress maker's getting antsy. She needs to start soon. [Sage clears throat] Leader. - You're Ika-chiro, isn't that right? - Ichiro, sir. - Oh yes of course, Ichiro, how stupid of me. So how are you my boy? - I'm doing very well, thank you. - And Naomi. Beautiful as ever. - Thank you. - So let's sit and talk. I hear you've been asking about our visitor. - Well, yes. - The timing of his arrival is actually most fortunate. - Because it's a holiday? - Because tomorrow's Armistice Day and he'll be a good role model. - Huh? [chattering] - Okay, stand by. Settle everyone, we're going live in five, four, three, two, one. - Good morning, welcome to our broadcast. We're gathered here, as I'm sure you know, to celebrate Armistice Day as we do every year. Three generations ago our great war came to an end. Now we take this opportunity to recall our glorious history to learn from the lessons of the past to avoid these mistakes in the future. This is particularly important for our children. - With us in the studio today, as always, to mark this most formal occasion, is our great leader. [applause] - To my fellow citizens, greetings one and all. - In the spirit of this joyous celebration, I'm sure you won't mind if I address you by your nickname, Sage? - Eh. [laughs] - We're a little short on time, folks. Moving right along, our great leader will now deliver his annual Armistice Day address. [chattering] [tense music] - For many of us here, there was a time when life was nearly impossible. Man and cockroach were bitterly divided by deep hatreds and misunderstanding. See, we cockroaches were despised as invaders. Eventually, the day came when the humans refused to accept our presence, when the happiness of the Hosino Tribe was disrupted by our innocent pursuit of food. [roaches chittering] [gunfire] [spraying] [melancholy music] The resulting war was a disaster for our tribe. Many brave roaches died, but then miraculously, the other side retreated and the sounds of battle were stilled. Standing in the midst if these ruins, I was struck by the realization that peaceful coexistence between our tribes was the only hope for the future. And peace finally did come to our world, thanks to our savior, Saito-san. In our darkest hour, he appeared, drove out our enemies, and treated us with the dignity of comrades. Saito-san, we make to you this sacred pledge, never again shall we disturb the peace between the tribe of man and the tribe of cockroach. [applause] Hear this, past indiscretions by our citizens will not be repeated. Our devotion to peace is heartfelt and signals a new era of friendly relations. Pay heed, today the members of our tribe enjoy the fruits of a prosperous and peaceful land. But we're lucky. Elsewhere in the world, not all roaches are able to live in peace and tranquility with their human hosts. As proof, I'd like to present a young warrior. You'll see, he's a battle scarred fugitive from a war torn land and his presence offers some sobering thoughts on life as our ancestors knew it. [applause] - In our earlier conversation, you claimed that members of your tribe are being massacred, isn't that true? - Ya. - Can you give us some idea of the daily casualty figures? Is it in the hundreds? - Mhm. - Oh. It's so many. On top of that, you mentioned you had evidence of brutality? - Ya. - Crushings, poisoned gas, and senseless mutilations taking place on a huge scale, turning their world into a nightmarish combat zone. What a horror. Hans, I know this is hard but would you show the audience your battle scars? Here. [gasps] That looks so dreadful. Get a close up. Zoom until you fill the picture. Gee. That's awful. Let this serve as a reminder of the tragic costs of war. And now, one final word. - Let us give thanks to Saito-san. [singing in foreign language] [Hans grunts] [buzzing] [wind blowing] - Ready for take off. Number one. - Number one ready, go. [yelling] [laughing] - Fail. Next. - Ready. Go! [grunts] [cheering] - He passes. [buzzing] [cat meows] [yelling] [wind blowing] [buzzing] - What's wrong? Don't you love Ichiro anymore? - I'm not sure. We've been together so long, we finish each other's sentences. - But he's so gentle, so loving. Hm. Look. A pack of toilet roaches on the make. They're all so crude. They come down here every day looking for girls covered in shit. You'd think they'd have something better to do with their time. [toilet roaches laughing] Naomi? Don't tell anyone, but I'm giving birth next month. - What? Not again. - I've never had babies with Yasuo before. - Gosh, you're gonna die giving birth one of these times, and I've yet to have my first litter. I wish I was pregnant. [splashes] Good evening, grandfather. It's me, Naomi. Are you busy? I wanted to ask you-- [gasps] Oh my heavens. Hans, what are you doing here? I thought the authorities had big plans for you. - Keep your voice down. [Naomi gasps] - But why? - Please, wait for me in the kitchen. - Oh. [melancholy music] - [Hans] That's all I know. Good bye for now. - Hans, Hans. Oh. - His mission is done, he's going back. [gasps] - Back there? Why? Why must he go back to a living hell? - Duty. He'll risk his life to return to his home. - I'm confused. Duty? [melancholy music] After Hans had left, grandfather came out and told me a story. It was about my grandmother who had passed away years before. He said she was 19 when the Hosino War came to an end. She appeared after having made a long journey, all by herself. When she met grandfather, she was already with child. And like Hans, as it turned out, she was from a tribe that lived across the field, a tribe that lived under siege in a war ravaged land. It was then I knew I had to cross that field and be with Hans. [melancholy music] [hitting] [birds chirping] - Ah. - Have you seen Naomi? - Nope, not today. She's been kind of moody, spending a lot more time alone. - Are you sure about that? [laughs] - Naomi, will you at least come and check it out? What's the matter? You don't like the place? - That's not the problem. - Naomi. [upbeat music] [laughing] [upbeat music] [laughing] [soft music] [soft percussive music] - [Feces] Well little girl, what are you doing way out here? - Ew, a talking turd. - Are you prejudiced against droppings? - Um, wait no, it's just that I never expec-- - Sure. - No, really. - Everybody says that until they step in it. I don't suppose you're looking for that chap who just passed by here a few moments ago, are you? - You mean Hans? I've been trying to find him. - Oh? Well. I guess this is your lucky day then. He went that way, to the right. [soft percussive music] [sighs] [wind blowing] [gasps] [heavy breathing] [grunting] [hits] [grunts] [screams] [grunts] [heavy breathing] [thunder rumbling] [lightening striking] [gasps] [thunder rumbling] [rain pattering] [lightening striking] - Naomi's run away? But where? - [Grandpa] I don't know. - She can't just pick up and leave this way. The wedding's all arranged, the invitations have been sent out. [rain pattering outside] - Sorry. [Yasuo grunts] [rain pattering] [wind blowing] [thunder rumbling] [rain pattering] [wind blowing] [crashing] [wind blowing] [water rushing] - [Torah] Naomi. Naomi. [grunts] [soft music] [swatting] [refrigerator buzzing] - [Soldier Roach] Who is she after now? - I have not a clue. Some careless idiot. - Our advanced warning system must have failed. [spraying] [soldiers yell] [gurgling] [spits] [gurgling] [spits] [footsteps echoing] - Let's go. [clothes rustling] [hair whips] [clothes rustling] [zips] [bed creaks] [jewelry jangling] [bed creaks] [chattering] - Everyone, prepare to move out. [roaches speak in foreign language] Battalion one, you will attack the first target. [roaches marching] Company T, target two. [roaches marching] Hans! - Ya? - [General] Your men will capture target three. [roaches marching] All troops begin deployment on my command. Move out! [roaches marching] [soft music] [roaches marching] [Naomi gasps] [soft, tense music] [roaches marching] - Oh my. Hans. Hans! [grunts] [peeling] [soft, tense music] [chopping] [soft, tense music] - Go. [chopping] [soft, tense music] [buzzing] Now, let's go. [soft, tense music] [swatting] [soldiers yelling] [heavy breathing] [swats] Times up, move out. Take Oshoken and Heto home, quickly. - [Soldier] Everyone, retreat. Go, get out! Move! Faster! [spraying] [soldiers yelling] - Take hold of me. [gasps] [grunts] [spraying] [Hans yells] [tense music] [soldiers chattering] - All right, leave some for the others. - [Commandant] What is it, Hans? - Commandant. With your permission, I request the honor of leading the next attack. - You're much too valuable to be sacrificed in a losing battle. Request is denied. [soldiers chattering] - Hans! Hans! [tense music] [tapping] - My fellow roaches, today we face a cataclysmic crisis. Once again, greedy humans are attempting to withhold food from us, just as they have for millions of years. They were not content to simply throw us out of the Garden of Eden, now they are on a mission to destroy us. [dramatic music] Through all the centuries of conflict, we roaches as a species have never killed a single human being. Not one. So why is man obsessed with the idea that he has the right to annihilate us? To commit genocide on an entire race? [dramatic music] I'll tell you, it's because man fears what he does not understand. [roaches exclaiming] It's obvious to any intelligent observer that God chose the roach to inherit the world. We are much more adaptable than man, we can live where man cannot. We are able to eat food that would turn man's stomach and sicken him. Most important, our race is in tune with the great forces of nature. We know who we are. We roaches have establish an unbroken chain of genealogy that transcends the ages and we are proud of the purity of our species. [roaches exclaiming] And we will fight back. For every hundred that are killed, we'll breed 10,000 reinforcements. And for 10,000 lost, a million more will rise in their stead. I give you my solemn oath we roaches shall prevail. [roaches yelling] [dramatic music] [audience members yelling] [bed creaking] [television blaring] - [Messenger] You're relieved for the night. - [Look Out] Where's Captain Hans? - [Messenger] Off duty. - [Look Out] Oh. [soft piano music] - I'm scared. The terror you have to live with everyday. Horrendous. Awful. - I'm scared. All the time. [soft piano music] - [Naomi] Hans went into battle every day. Many brave roaches died. But Hans was lucky. Somehow he always managed to survive, just as he had since the day we first came together. Each night when he returned, he'd whisper to me, "I'm alive. "I'm still alive." [soft piano music] - [Surveyor] 2.35 meters. Next! [whimpering] [roaches laugh] - Ready. - [Surveyor] Let's go, what's the hold up? - Oh, go on. [yelling] [roaches laughing] [birds chirping] - I'm sure Naomi will be back soon. I'm not calling off the wedding and that's that. She must have a good reason, I know her. - Listen, Ichiro. I think you're probably right but my staff plans to attend that wedding. They say you have a lot on the ball. If she does leave you standing at the altar, you're gonna look pretty foolish, right? - Well then, I'll have to quit. - Oh, come on. Face it. She isn't worth sacrificing your whole career. Call it off now. Save you and your family from the public humiliation. - No. We're going on as planned. - That's absurd. [laughs] - Be there on time. - What? Now wait just a minute. Think about it. I'm gonna look like an idiot if I'm standing there and she doesn't show. - You'll be in good company. - But, I'm leader of this tribe, you understand? It's bad form. - Listen, old friend. Don't worry, it's not like you haven't lost face in public before. If you get my meaning. - All right. - Reporting as ordered, captain. Regarding the girl, sir, I mean no disrespect but she'll only bring us bad luck. [hits] [grunts] - Time to move out. [ice clinking] [air conditioner rattling] [hits] [rattling] [insects buzzing] [door slams] [insects buzzing] [chittering] [Naomi gasps] [screaming] [grunting] [grunts] - Oh, I'm stuck. Help me, somebody. Hans! [gasps] [weak chittering] [grunting] [heavy breathing] [footsteps echoing] [clock ticking] [doorbell chimes] [footsteps approach] [door opens] [door closes] [jewelry jangling] [clock ticking] - Huh? Naomi? Naomi, Naomi! Oh. Huh? Naomi, you're home. Thank goodness. [sobbing] Naomi? [sobbing] Why did you leave? [tense music] [laughing] [tense music] [bed creaking] [soft, tense music] [Naomi whimpering] [soft, tense music] [bell chiming] [chattering] [bell chiming] [chattering] - [Yasuo] I'm starting to worry about this wedding. Something's wrong with Naomi. - Really? Did you talk to Ichiro about it? - Yeah, he says she's all right, she just got amnesia. You wanna know my theory? I think she's in shock. - We'd better not tell her that Parsley died giving birth last week. - Absolutely right. She's spooked enough already. - Hey, smile, he's looking at us. [chattering] - [Roach With Glasses] Well I heard she'd been missing for three weeks. - [Male Roach] Shh, it's being kept under wraps. - [Female Roach] Supposedly her grandfather's been gone as well. - [Roach A Glasses] Hm, those two are cut from the same loaf, that's what I say. - [Male Roach] I guess you ladies heard what happened this morning. - What? - What? - We found dead roaches, three of them. - Hm, it must've been young hoodlums that did it. They have no respect for anything. - That's not what the authorities think. Their crushed bodies were found tossed in a trash basket. From the evidence they think it could only have been done by a human. [both gasp] [grand orchestral music] - Our fearless leader didn't make it. - Oh, Sage? Well I'm not surprised, he probably got delayed by work. - Or by a redhead. [grand orchestral music] - Oh mighty God in heaven, all knowing Torah, souls of our ancestors draw close. We bring before you these young ones, Naomi and Ichiro, to join them in holy matrimony in accordance with the traditions of our race. We ask your blessing on this ceremony. To begin properly, you must touch feelers. Now, repeat your vows to each other. - Uh. I, Ichiro, take you Naomi, to be my wedded wife, to love and to hold forever. - And I, Naomi, take you Ichiro-- [gasps] [glass shatters] It's her again. [smashing] [roaches yelling] [smashing] [roaches yelling] [chattering] [sobbing] [melancholy music] [chattering] [melancholy music] - Thank you for all your help, men. I won't take but a few moments. Fellow citizens. Well, what can I say? Words are inadequate but I offer condolences to the victims and their families. Our tribe has suffered a vicious and unprovoked attack. The assailant is apparently an outsider and as far as we can determine, has left the vicinity. Also, it appears Saito-san has developed a relationship with this female and we may be seeing more of her in the future. - Why weren't we given any warning about her? - There was a break down in communication among our perimeter guards and unfortunately, we had no reports of her entry into our territory. Now, listen. Tomorrow I'm going to meet with Saito and settle this issue once and for all. I pledge to you I'll make sure that this kind of thing never happens to our community ever again. - [Ichiro] Naomi. - [Yasuo] Ichiro, you're all right. Thank goodness, we thought you were one of the casualties. [melancholy music] - [Grandpa] Naomi. [grandpa grunts] - [Naomi] Oh grandfather. [Naomi sobbing] - Everyone must return to their homes. A curfew is in effect, clear the streets. [blows raspberry] You have to go home, a state of emergency exists. - Emergency my segmented foot. We were told the danger has passed. You're out of control. You're violating our civil rights. - We could be attacked any time. - That's what we pay you for. You're supposed to be protecting us. [chattering] [laughing] - There you are. - Hm? - So? How's he doing? - Hm? Um, no change really. He's been sitting in that chair for hours now. - Good, if that's any indication, it means things are back to normal. [laughs] Relax. Come with us. - Huh? But I'm on duty. - [Yasuo] Oh give me a break, come on, it's sports night. We'll have a good time aye? - [Takashi] Well maybe just for a little bit. - [Yasuo] I knew you wouldn't let me down. Is this guy something? "On duty," please. [soft music] [footsteps approaching] [soft music] [chattering] - Rebecca. [soft tinkling music] - Isn't this great? Look at it. [soft tinkling music] - Tommy just loves these horses. [soft tinkling music] [doorbell chimes] [jewelry jangling] [rustling] [jewelry jangling] [soft tinkling music] [door closes] [chattering] [laughing] [spraying] [yelling] [roach children shouting] [spraying] [spraying] [roaches yelling] [coughing] [yelling] [spraying] [roaches yelling] [spraying] [roaches yelling] [yawns] [water splashes] [vacuum cleaner buzzing] [rummaging] [vacuum cleaner buzzing] - It was always like this when I was just a hatchling. Doesn't frighten me one bit. Scrambling for food and water is good for ya, it builds character. - I couldn't agree more. It'll always be like this for roaches. We're scavengers. Humans will never respect us. - Hm. I don't understand why we're being treated like this. We have a right to the good life just like anyone else. [laughing] - Yeah, sure. Oop. - Come on, this was an isolated act of madness. Humans love cockroaches. - Oh is that so? And what numbskull talked to you? - Sage himself told me that. - My, my, what an astute thing for our late leader to say, right? - Sharp as a tack. - Yes, he got right to the point. Of course it's not nice to speak ill of the dead. On the other hand, I never spoke well of him when he was alive. [laughs] - Why are you being so mean? - Listen, baby face. This attitude problem on the part of the humans is nothing new. They have been killing is like flies since before my grandfather was born. Isn't that true, Elder? - [Elder] Is a frog's ass water tight? - [Old Roach] You bet your feelers it is. The fact is, they can't stand anything about us, from the way we eat to the way we look. While we're on the subject, you might as well know the truth about the so-called Hosino Wars. Every part of that story was a lie from start to finish. Sage made the whole thing up. [spraying] [tense music] Saito was actually the head of the Hosino Clan before he broke up with his wife and she moved out. Now there's a new woman in his life and she's incited him to kill us once again, just as he did in the old days. When he was alone, he had no motivation to get rid of us. We even provided a diversion for him. But now, we're in the way, and he wants to impress his new girlfriend. - But how come Sage lied about everything? - It was simple, he never new the truth. Sage hid in the cellar during the entire war. When it was over he came out and proclaimed himself the leader of the tribe. He'd never even met Saito until his wife had already left him. [shots firing] - Yasuo's missing. We looked all over but he's gone. - I had a very disturbing dream last night. You were in it, Ichiro. - Yeah? - The moon was shining down on our home, but it was a barren wasteland. You and I were the only ones left alive. All our friends, their children, their families, everyone had been killed. [sobbing] [upbeat news music] - [Richard] AP Network News, I'm Richard Johnson. Starting with Clayton Lowtree, the former marine guard accused of spying, will be going to trial. Here's the latest from the AP's Sean Anderson. - [Sean] Lieutenant General Frank Peterson Jr., has told military prosecutors to begin court-martial proceedings against Lowtree on 13 of the original 24 counts, including one count of espionage. - No problem. All you have to do is move in straight lines. You wanna learn something? Watch a real cockroach in action, pay attention. So, ready to go? - Ready. I'm all set. [grunts] [cracking] Okay. [television blaring] [yells] [upbeat percussive music] - [Ichiro] Oh my god, she's seen him. - [Takashi] No, she hasn't. Watch this. Rule number one, always use black as a cover. [upbeat percussive music] [Ichiro gasps] Stay in the shadows. It's a simple camouflaging technique. [Ichiro gasps] - [Ichiro] What's the maneuver? - Just as old roach showing off. [upbeat percussive music] [water drips] [soft music] [creaking] [spraying] - [Roach] Everybody get back! They're trying to break through! [creaking] [tape dispensing] [roaches chattering] - Hey, our best chance is out in the open, come on. - [Roach] No, no, you're safer here. Get as far back into the foundation as you can. [soft music] [roaches chattering] - [Hans] We are following the correct path. We should arrive by early tomorrow morning, commandant. [tense, dramatic music] - We face destiny at sunrise. Be silent and heed the words of our Enforcer. [tense, dramatic music] - [Hans] Comrades! From now on, you and your families shall never again feel the pain of hunger. [tense, dramatic music] Starting tomorrow, it will be full bellies for everyone. [roaches cheering] Now onto victory! [roaches cheering] - [Commandant] Good work Hans. By the way, congratulations on your promotion. - Grandfather? I have news. I'm pregnant. I found out today. Only... It's not Ichiro's, I think the litter belongs to Hans. [soft music] - Oh, likely it belongs to each of them. This is good, 'cause Ichiro is honest and Hans is strong. Listen carefully, Naomi. [soft music] Tomorrow night, just as the moon rises in the evening sky, come to this shrine alone. - [Naomi] What about you? - [Grandfather] Come alone. - [Naomi] All right. - [Grandfather] And be at peace with yourself. Before you come, clear your heart and mind of all turmoil. When you pray to Torah, raise your head and say, "I am Naomi, your namesake." [snoring] [soft chattering] - Takashi Takashi. Wake up, you're on central duty. - Okay, I'm awake. [Naomi grumbles] [roaches snoring] [yawns] [roaches snoring] [floor creaking] [creaking] [banging] [creaking] - Batallion one, up there in place, hold your position.

Our tribe is peace loving. - Hm. - Hm. - We don't know how to cope with this, but if you have any ideas, we'll be glad to provide all the help you need. - I have a plan. We'll attack the humans full force, and all our fight. Drive them from the area. - [All Three] Long live the Enforcer. - [Enforcer] And you will lead the attack Hans. - Sir, it will be done. [grunting] - [General] Company B, move out! - [Soldiers] Yes sir! [tense music] - It has been a long time my friend. - And you've come a long way, I thank you. - I've come to say good bye. Events are now in motion and my job is done. The prophecy will come to pass. - Many will die. - [Enforcer] It was you who taught me never to be sentimental. - The hope of your tribe lies entirely with Hans. - As fate would have it.

[grunting] - I have a message for the Enforcer, do you understand? - He is in conference, commander, and cannot be disturbed. - This is urgent. - He said no exceptions-- - [Ichiro] Naomi! Naomi, stop. - Naomi. [soft music] - So it's come down to this. Total war. But you know what? I'm going to survive it, I feel certain about that. - Maybe so. I hope so. Then, when it's all over, you and I can settle things between us. [soldiers marching in the distance] - [Commander] Battalion leaders, report! - [Third Battalion Leader] Battalion three ready. - [Eighth Battalion Leader] Battalion eight ready. - It's time. - Follow me. [alarm beeping] [squashing] [buzzing] [roaches chittering] Hold your positions. I think they see us, commander. [roaches chittering] [buzzing] Wait! I didn't give the order! Fools. [roaches yelling] [buzzing] [igniting] [roach soldiers yelling] [stomping] [yelling] [spraying] [igniting] [coughing] [chattering] - Come on men! [roach soldiers yelling] [yelling] [spraying] [dramatic music] - Dive down under the fumes, it's our only chance. Let's split up. [dramatic music] [gasps] [coughing] [gasps] [yells] [grunts] [grunting] [stomps] [roaches yelling] [yelling] [coughing] [tense music] [creaking] [yelling] [Ichiro and Naomi breathing heavily] [heavy breathing] [grunting] - [Grandpa] Naomi? I want you and Ichiro to stay here a while. [smacks] [wind blowing] - [Enforcer] Locate Hans. I must talk to him immediately. - Yes, sir, you asked to see me? - There is no choice, you must escape. You have to survive to carry on the fight. - Sir, must I leave? - Yes, Hans. They've all died for your sake. Move out. [footsteps echoing] [laughing] [spraying] [Enforcer laughing] [heavy breathing] - Commander! [grunts] [spraying] [soldier yells] - Over there, the wall. [heavy breathing] Naomi! [slams] [soft, melancholy music] - Naomi. I want you to close your eyes and count to 100. - Why? - Humor me. - [Naomi And Ichiro] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... [soft, melancholy music] [eating] [buzzing] [grunts] [plops] [soft, melancholy music] - Naomi! Naomi! [insects buzzing] - [Naomi] I, too, am called Naomi. I am your namesake. I pray to you, Torah. Hear me, I am Naomi. [insects buzzing] - [Torah] Naomi. [gasps] Naomi. Naomi! - Naomi! Naomi! Naomi! Naomi! [Naomi grunts] Thank goodness you're all right. [floor creaking] [Ichiro gasps] Quickly, come on. [floor creaking] [soft, melancholy music] - [Torah] Naomi. Naomi. I am Naomi, your grandmother. Listen carefully. What I have to tell you is crucial to your survival. In order to improve our breed, God has provided challenges of increasing difficulty. In this latest trial, he has allowed humans to develop deadlier and deadlier poisons. Only the fittest of the race will be able to survive exposure to these toxins and they will provide the seed for the preservation of our species. As mankind develops new chemicals, our race must develop new levels of resistance or perish. In our previous war with the humans, I discovered that their poisons had no effect on me and along with two strong males, I was able to survive. If you're hearing this message, war has broken out again and most of your tribe has been destroyed. You now know that the God of all of us is unmerciful in his decisions. Naomi. You are the hope of all those who died trying to preserve our species and like me, you must go on to fulfill your destiny and the destiny of our race. [floor creaking] - [Ichiro] Hm? [floor creaking] - Ichiro. Go and meet me near the shrine. - Torah? [floor creaking] - Go! - Naomi, wait! [spraying] [Naomi screams] [grunting] [heavy breathing] [yells] [spraying] [heavy breathing] [grunting] [yelling] Huh? Oh, I'm flying. [laughs] [soft rock music] [shooting] [soft rock music] [Naomi breathing heavily] [grunting] [soft music] [woman vocalizing] [soft music] [soft music] [soft music]
