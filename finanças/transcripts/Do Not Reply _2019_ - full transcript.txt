Uh, what is it? Dylan just sent me a picture of his dick. Seriously? Yeah. I think he's gonna ask me to be his girlfriend. I mean don't you think so if he sent that? Well, how would I know? I can't seem to get a boyfriend. Chelsea, you would if you'd just put yourself out there. So anyway, did you send him a pic like that, too? Yeah, we swapped a few. What if he shows his friends? I don't think he would do that. Well how do you know you can trust him? You're not even dating yet. You're right. I'm gonna send his dick pic to you. No! No, no, no! Ew. I don't want to see his thing! Ugh. Okay, I gotta go. I'll see you at school. Yeah, she's such a bitch. - Getting an early start? - Not really. It's almost October. - Oh, whatever works. - Oh. - Oh, shit. - Oh, we can't forget this. Oh, Mom, I thought I got rid of that. Oh, gosh, it's so precious. Someday you will thank me for pulling this out of the trash. Whatever, ho. She's your friend. Mom, can you please take me to school today? Not when Kristina is already driving there, no. Mom, I can't stand riding with her. Please, please? Honestly, what is the problem with you two? It's her and her elitist stuck-up friends, that's the problem. Look, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to work this out, okay? Have a good day at school. She shouldn't even be on our team. I mean, she sucks and she knows it. Gotta go. Oh! - Oh, he's cute. Can I talk to him? - Give it to me. Shit! Not again! - So, who is he? - I don't know. Oh, so you have a secret admirer. No. I don't. Okay, can we just go? Maybe she wants to come. That's you. It's such a you quote. If alcohol is involved, I am in. Always, bro. Always. Then we can go back to my house and watch Santiago. - Oh, yes. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - You down? - I'm down. - Alright. What was that all about? There's a change of plans for tonight. Wait, what? Dylan just asked me to go over to his house. But we never skip movie night. For anything. His parents are going to be gone. Don't worry. Dylan said Seth's gonna be there, so you can come too, and we can all watch a movie. You know I hate being forced into social situations. He knows you're gonna be there and said he'd show up. Seth? Seriously? He's barely ever talked to me. How could you tell him I was already going? He said he wanted to hang out with you. And besides, I knew you'd help me out. With what? You guys stay in the living room watching the movie while Dylan and I go to his bedroom. - Okay, wait. Me, alone with Seth? - You'll be fine. It'll only be for a few minutes. Okay, wait. Are you sure you're even ready for that? Yeah, I mean, well, we've basically seen each other naked with all the pictures we've shared. Okay, yeah, ew. You fucking scared? Act your way out of this, huh? Come on. Act like you ain't. Come on! - Sure. You want to? - Hm. Bottoms up! Oh, wow. Um, so what kind of music do you listen to? I like a lot of music, so. Um... Do you like the movie? I'm actually more interested in you. I mean, look at this. Look at what you've done. Chelsea, seriously, I'm gonna be really mad at you if you don't tell me what happened. I really don't want to talk about it. Ugh, come on, who else are you gonna tell? Please? I mean, I'm sure Seth already told him what happened. Okay, fine. I totally freaked out last night. What happened? We were only gone for like ten minutes. Seth tried to get me to go down on him. I pushed him off and then I ran out. I'm so embarrassed. - I think that's all he wanted. - You should have just done it. Ew, Mia. No. I can't even believe you did that to Dylan. - You're not even technically together, are you? - We are now. - Dylan asked me out last night. - How romantic. Hello, ladies. -Hey. Chelsea, I heard you choked last night. That's not funny, Dylan. I'm just playin'. You don't worry. After you left, Seth got so drunk he probably doesn't remember anything. - I know. - I missed you. Yeah, I missed you too. Give it up. I wasn't doing anything. I was just holding it. - Hand it over, Chelsea. - I'm sorry. I'll put it away. - Please? - Sorry. Rules are rules. Mom, it's not fair. The school year just started, and this is the second time I had to go to the principal's office to get your phone. Yeah, but a whole month? Chelsea, he said the next time this happened, you would be suspended. I wish Dad was home. Yeah. You think that he would like to hear that you haven't been following the rules? Come in. Oh, my God, did you find one? It works, but it has a small screen. Oh, my gosh, I don't care. You've literally saved my life. - If your mom finds out, you didn't get it from me, okay? - Of course. Okay. I gotta get going. - What? Why? - I'm going to go see Dylan. Please don't be mad at me. Okay, you know what? Don't worry about me. Okay, you sound mad. No. Go and have your fun. You obviously don't care about anyone else but Dylan. How can you even say that? You know what? You're welcome for the phone. Oh, shit. Mom, where's Kristina? She went to Tracy's house to study. Yeah, sure she did. Oh, shit! Uh, hello? Hi. I can't see you very well. Yeah, I know. I dropped my phone too many times, and my parents won't buy me another one until next year. Uh, can you see me? Yeah. And, wow! Yeah. I think my parents are going to get me a car for my eighteenth birthday. Oh, nice! Uh, What kind do you want? Something fast, but I think I'm just going to get their SUV. If you get one, maybe we can go out on a real date. Oh, so now you're ready to go on a date. I think so, now that I know you better. We don't have to wait. Oh, we don't? I can take a bus. Well, where would we meet? How about your house? I can meet your mom and your sister. Are you kidding? No way. I haven't told anyone about you yet. Why not your place? Yeah, my parents don't know anything about you either. Uh... How about somewhere in between? Okay. As long as I can take a bus, too. Would you like to bring your friend, Mia? Mia's too self-absorbed with Dylan. Besides, she would think I was crazy or desperate if I saw a guy I met through an app. What do you think about that? That I must be crazy. I mean, I know we haven't seen each other in person, but I feel like we know more about each other than people who meet normally. - What? - I'm all finished. Can we eat now? Go away! I said not to bother me. Sorry. Uh, that was my sister. My foster sister, Sadie. Oh I, I didn't know you had a sister? She's adopted? No. Actually, I was. Sounds like she gets on your nerves. Well, she's not, perfect. Well, I'm... I'm not either. You could be perfect for me. - I have an idea. - What is it? Halloween is this Friday. I saw an ad for a warehouse party we could both take a bus to. We can get dressed up and everything. Okay, what would I go as? How about a zombie cheerleader? Okay, and what would you go as? A zombie quarterback. Could be fun. Hey, is Mia still coming over? Uh, no. She's going to Dylan's Halloween party. You're not going to go with her? No, I don't want to go anywhere. - I think I'm just gonna stay here and pass out candy. - Okay. Well, I will be back in the morning around seven. - Love you. Oh, hi! Giddy-up! - Okay. And, who are you supposed to be? Jessie, the Cowgirl from Toy Story. Duh. Brendon's going as Woody. Oh, okay, I hope his Woody's more covered than you are. Aren't you the funny one? Have fun playing with yourself tonight. What are you even doing? Um, trying to look like a zombie? Here, I'll help you with it. - Boo! - Oh, my God. You're such an asshole! And you are the most beautiful dead girl I've ever seen. Thank you. - Did you bring any alcohol? - Uh, no. I... I didn't. - You said you like screwdrivers, right? - Yeah, totally. Come on. I got some. Here, right here. Thanks. I can't. Um... Oh, yeah. I... I just need to make sure I get home before midnight. Whenever you need to leave, just let me know. - Um... Oh wow! - Yeah! - Let's go. - Oh, wait! We don't want to get caught with alcohol on the street. - Let's just finish it here. - Uh, sure. - Okay. - Cheers! You know, it's weird that I can't see your face. Oh, wow, that, that hit me fast. - You okay? - Uh-huh. - Here, come this way. - W... where? We can sit in my car until you feel better. I thought you took a bus, too. Ooh, zombie cheerleader. Hot! - Oh. - Dude, she is wasted! Hey, is she okay? - Come on! - What, wait... No, no. Come on. Come on. This way, this way, this way, this way. I got you. Here. Please. No, no. Please don't hurt me. Please don't. Be still. Brad? Please, let me go home. Please? Good morning, Sadie. Brad, you know my name is Chelsea. Your name, is... Sadie now. Hi. Come here, Little buddy. Do you like that name? Little Buddy? No, no, no! No don't go. Please! No! Please! Now... what's your name? Come on. You're a smart girl. Apparently, it's Sadie. Sarcasm is disrespectful. I'm, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll be good. I promise. You see? It's not that hard. Eat up. Disgusting. No! No! No! Wait. Wait. Who are you? I'm Sadie. - You're Sadie? - Yes. - Thank God. Thank God. I'm... - Sadie. From now on, your name is Sadie. - You're letting me go? - Brad is. Why are you helping him? Please! Why are you hurting me? I'm stopping us from getting into trouble. Are you going to behave? Okay! Okay! Grab that rug rake and rake the living room. If you are the last person in a room, make sure the carpet is perfect when you leave. Everything must always stay neat and clean. Come in. Don't be shy. What's your name? S... Sadie. Your real name. It's Sadie. Good girl. You know what to do. Aren't you going to help? I'm making Brad's favorite cake for dinner. Strip down. Believe me. You do not want to go down to dinner looking like that. Your uniform has to be cleaned. All the way down. Those need to be washed as well. I can do it myself. Take them off. And get into the tub. You need to bleach your hair now. What? Why? Because Brad says so. Everything is because Brad says so. Oh, my God. What... what happened to you? - You slut. - What? Get out! Get out, you backstabbing whore! Don't. No, no, no, no. Do you like what you see? Get out of here, you perv. Mom! Sadie. I know what you're doing, Sadie. Is this what you want, Sadie? Hmm? Yes. I always have. Have you seen her yet? I did. What happened to you? Kitchen accident. Totally my fault. Here, put these on. Make sure you wear them every time you leave your room. She... she needs a doctor. It's not gonna happen. She's gonna die if she doesn't get help. Brad's not stupid. He knows he can't take her anywhere. He says we have to nurse her back to health. I don't know why everyone is just going along like this isn't nuts, okay. Has anyone even tried to find a way out? Don't talk about that. With anyone. You just saw what happens when someone tries to escape. Here. Put on some makeup. It should look like mine. Come on. Sit. Let me help you. I'm going to need you to stop crying, otherwise your makeup will run. My favorite part of the day is coming up before dinner. Might cheer you up. - What could possibly be good here? Outside time. We get to go outside? You'll see. Beautiful. Hey. I'm next. Outside time is over. Hey. Look, I know it's hard here at first, but act normal at dinner. And try to save some food for the girl in the room next to you. That's all she gets to eat. Fix your hair. Okay. Where are your manners, Sadie? Control yourself, or you'll be back in the hole. Hello. Do you want that? Oh, sorry. No. Okay. Is something wrong, Sadie? It's okay. You can tell me. I miss my mom. What about your dad? You know the Army sent him home early to help look for you. They think, you might have run away. Yeah, you're finally getting more attention than your sister. Isn't that what you've always wanted? That's the last we'll talk about them. This is your new family. There's no crying at the table. If you want to eat, I suggest you control yourself. What are you doing? Brad says when we become perfect, we're allowed to leave. You're leaving? Just like that? Not just like that. Been here for almost three years. - This room is yours now. - Oh, no. I... I can't stay here. Okay, please. I can't. Hey listen, when you go to the police, tell them that my name is Chelsea Wilson. He has sworn if I go to the police... Let's go. Time for your final performance, Sadie. Hang in there. Shh. Listen. I'm not who you think I am. And my name is Chelsea. I'm new here. Now, are you going to stay quiet? What's your name? Tina Morelli. I... I know that name. Yeah, I saw your parents on TV. They're... they're still looking for you. Why are we doing it down there? It's so dirty. Brad? Arthur Bradley. Sadie needs your room now, so that I can be closer to her. - But it's my room! - Not anymore! Both of you can't stay in the same room. It's not appropriate. You're my perfect little baby. I wish she was never born! - Ah! - You just earned yourself a day in the shelter! I don't want to go down there! Look what you just did! Brad? This video... it's going to be something different. A piece of art. Something that has never been done before. And if, when you finish, you get to go home. Okay? Start off on the other side of the room, with your back to me. You ready? Action. Ready! Okay! You're joking, right? Brad. Brad, say something! You're scaring me! You said I was perfect. You are. And that's why your mother always hated me. Ever since the day you were born. I'm not your sister Sadie! That's the spirit! Please! You've always tried to hurt me. Every. Chance. You got. I'm going to watch you die, over and over again. Brad? Psst! Can you hear me? Hello? Behind the night stand. Down near the floor. Oh. So now you're taking care of the girl in the next room? Yeah. She said you got her in trouble. Why would you do that? Oh, don't believe her. The bitch tried to escape and got caught. It's as simple as that. I think she tried to leave because Brad chose me over her. Chose you? You make it sound like it's a good thing. What happened to your face? He took me in his room last night. He's a bit rough sometimes. - He rapes you? - No. No, no, no. It's not like that. It's okay. - What do you mean it's okay? - I love him. - Are you crazy? - He understands me. He hasn't said it yet, but I think he loves me, too. He's a psycho, okay? He can't love anyone. Brad's nicer to me than anyone in my own family. They all hated me. Brad helped me realize that. How long have you been here? A long time. So don't think you can come in here and take him away from me. - Are you okay? - Don't mother me. Nice, that you took it all for yourself. Put it down. Don't even touch that food. Stop it! Just stop it. Stop. No outside time for either of you today. So he was nice to you? Only when he found out I was pregnant. Oh, my God, he got you pregnant? I didn't want his baby at first, but then I felt it moving one day... ...and I knew I had to get out of this house. That's why I tried to escape. But he was right there. And he beat me. Please. No! And the baby? I lost her. At least I thought it was a girl. You have to help me. How? Bring me enough painkillers to end this. What? No, I won't do that. It's getting worse. I'm not going to make it. Wait. Where are you going? It's no use. We need to get you to a hospital. That's impossible. It's too late. Please, just help me. No. I told you I'm not gonna do that, okay? I'm in constant pain. I can't live like this anymore. It's my decision. Okay, fine. Then tell me everything you know about how to get out of here. - I'll take care of that. - You go clean the living room. Okay. Don't ever touch this picture! Chelsea! What's wrong? Are you okay? Brad's mowing the lawn right now. It'd be a good time to get me those pills. They're in his right nightstand. In the top drawer. I'm... I'm locked in. There's nothing I can do. I found a way to get out of my room when it's locked. Why didn't you tell me this before? I didn't want you to rush out and get caught. But I'll tell you now. Just get me the pills. How do you know it's him and not a neighbor? W... What if he walks back in? I know the sound of Brad's lawnmower. What if he notices the pills are missing? He won't. - Brad has tons of them. - No, I don't know. Are you sure you want to do this? It's not moving. You have to apply a lot of pressure, and move it sharply sideways. I got it! Be careful. If you hear the lawnmower stop, get back quick. No, no. Oh, shit! You are more trouble than you're worth. At least now, no one else will try to escape, will they? Shut up. Shut up! Let me help you. Get the hell out of here! Now! Go back to your room, or you're next. Brad, please don't. What did I just tell you? Please, just let him. Can I do it? What? What are you trying to say, huh? Can I do it? Come on, lemme do it. But you're not supposed to be in here. Please? Let me do it. Fine. It was boring anyway. This I have to see. At least it's not him. It's okay. Just breathe in slowly. Wow! This... this is something for us to remember. Forever. It's just the adrenaline rush, okay? You'll get through it. Hey, hey. Come here. It's okay. I want to show you something. Don't worry about that. I'll clean that up later. Select the one for stabbing Sadie. Action! Ready! Okay! You're joking, right? I'm not your sister Sadie! What did you think? Did it... did it bother you? It's such a rush. It took my breath away! My turn. Ready! Okay! You're joking, right? Um, how does this work? Can I try it? Not right now. I want to make another one. - Another video of what? - Your sister, Sadie. She's just been bugging the shit out of me ever since you got here. You and me both. How do you think we should kill her? Oh, uh... I don't know. I want to do something different. Maybe something medieval, like... crushing her skull with a sledgehammer or just taking off her head with a sword. You know, I think with muscles like yours, you should just beat the shit out of her. Just punch her, over and over. That way we have a long video to watch. That's brutal. I like it. - Wait, now? - Right now. Shouldn't we talk it over? You know, plan it out? No. Mm-mm. I can always get more girls. You know, I was thinking we could do something else right now. Like what? I never knew someone like you could exist. You know, I can say the same about you. You're perfect. No one's ever said that to me before. Come with me. Good night. ♪ Remember how my hands ♪ ♪ Traced along the outlines Of yours ♪ ♪ Do you remember when ♪ ♪ Shooting stars At midnight falling ♪ ♪ Deep in love But now it's stalling ♪ ♪ I have my fair share ♪ ♪ Of people that I really ♪ ♪ Walking on thin ice ♪ ♪ Don't give in No giving up on love ♪ ♪ Not without a fight ♪ Uh, Brad, would you like the last pancake? No. Thank you, Sadie. I am very satisfied. I need to do a test with the new virtual reality camera and I need one of you lucky girls to help me. Can it be me? I've been practicing every day. Since you asked first. - Watch it! - That's enough. You see what I've been saying? Take your sister to her room. - Calm down. - You took the only thing I cared about. Meagan, you need to listen to me. You're in danger. - He's planning to kill you. Today. - Oh, yeah, right. Sure he is. You need to see this. I saw Brad do it. He was forcing the pillow on her face. I don't believe you. He's a murderer. Brad is not like that. She probably died on her own. No, he also killed Heather! He let Heather go. You're making all this up. I swear I'm not. He made a video with that camera thing, okay, and I saw him stabbing Heather through those goggles. You're just trying to turn me against him. It was real. - Show me. - I can't. It's too risky. Then you're a fucking liar. Hey! Wait! - What are you doing? - Get off of me! What the hell is going on? - Brad, this bitch is telling all kinds of lies about you. - She's crazy. Sadie, I have had enough of your bullshit. Get out of my sight. She said you killed two of our sisters. - You did what? - She's lying, okay. Don't believe her. She said she saw you stab our sister in the VR goggles. That's ridiculous! See? Why would you say that, Sadie? I... I don't... Shut up! I can't trust you. I can't trust any of you. Get upstairs. Now! Come on. And you, get in there! - Meagan! - Leave me alone! Meagan, you need to listen to me, okay? We have to work together. It's our only chance. No, we don't. You're the one that's in trouble. Meagan, he's going to kill both of us. He wouldn't do that. You saw what he did to Tina. And he killed Heather. I... I swear I'm telling you the truth. Then prove it! What are you doing? How did you get out? Tina's bedroom door is unlocked. Come on, the proof is in Brad's office. I'm not going out there. Brad is down in the hole preparing to kill you, Meagan. Wake up. Uh, here. Put this on. - Okay. - Sit down. You said I was perfect. No! That's the spirit! No! No! Please! You better stay right fucking there! Where... where are we going? No! No! No. Get up! Meagan! Help me! Meagan! Please help me! Get down there, or I will throw you down there head first. Everything you said to me... killing Tina... was all an act, wasn't it? I meant everything I said, Brad. I promise. Then why the fuck did you show her the VR stabbing? Because... because I... I thought she could maybe help us. She likes you, too, Brad. You expect me to believe that? Get up. I'll do anything you want, Brad. Please. Please. I don't want anything from you anymore, Sadie. Then what did you want? No, no, no! No! Why did you do this? I did it so we could be together. What are you saying, Brad? Put it down. Put it down! I'd rather die than be with you. No. No. no. No, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! Please. Please. I hope you like this. It was your idea. You make another move like that, I'll break your neck. Get off me! How about one more go at it for old times' sake. Meagan, get over here! Put down the knife, or I'll kill her right now. Don't listen to him. - Do it. - Okay. Okay. Now back up. Push him! Get his keys! I got them! -Let's go! Forget it! Okay! Let's go! Okay. Shit! Let's go! Get the door! I got it! - Help! - Help! Help! - Cell phone! - Please help us! Whoa! Slow down! Wait, what happened to you? Call 911. - Is there anyone else in there? I don't, I don't... know. Mom! Mom! Mom, it's me! Chelsea? Chelsea! Oh, my God, you're alive! Mike! Mike! Mike! Kristina! Come here, it's Chelsea! It's Chelsea! Oh, my God. What happened to you? Baby. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay, Dad. Where are you? I don't really know. You don't know? Because my parents made me. That's why. Yes. But, specifically, why are you here? So that a complete stranger can pry into my life? Chelsea, don't you think that what you've been through deserves some discussion? You want me to tell you every detail of what happened? Whatever comes to mind. I don't want to relive what happened again and again. I'm sure Brad is doing that every day, in whatever jail he's in. That's what he liked to do. You know, relive it all over again, and again. Chelsea, you will eventually get through this. And you can rest assured that Arthur, A.K.A. Brad... is not dealing well with his new situation. No, no! Somebody... Somebody help me! Somebody help me! No! Okay, um, what about him? Ugh, no. I got one. All right, he is cute. How old is he? Seventeen. And it says he's close by and has a car, look. Yeah, but, he's not gonna pick up a couple of 13-year-old girls. Now we're 16. Oh, my God, you didn't, did you? Yeah. And I just liked his profile pic.
