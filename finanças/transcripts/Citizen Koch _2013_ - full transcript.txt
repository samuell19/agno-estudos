And speaking of President Obama, I think we ought to pay tribute to him today on this Tax, Day Tea Party because really he's the inspiration for why we're here today. That's right. The Tea Party Movement wouldn't exist without Barack Obama. Madison, when the history of this Tea Party Movement is written, what you accomplished here will not be forgotten. God has shed His grace on thee, America. We will not squander what we have. We will fight for America! And it starts here in Madison, Wisconsin! It starts here! It starts now! Mr. President, game on! [CROWD CHANTING] Yes we can! Yes we can! -Congratulations, Mr. President. -Thank you, sir. Mr. President, I want to believe, I want to trust. I want to hope for change, but I am really failing to see how this is any different. He's not going to succeed. We have to bend over, grab the angles, bend over forward, backward, whichever because his father was black because this is the first black president. Not a single Republican joined the majority Democrats tonight. -Honeymoon is over. -Is it done? There's a lot of wife beating going on. Is President Obama's handling of the troubled economy a signal that we are creeping towards socialism? They got czars in the White House. Joseph Stalin without the bloodshed. Communist, the Marxist, they're taking over. [CROWD CHANTING] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Today is the beginning of the grassroots movements to take back this country. My brother, Charles and I provided the funds to start the Americans for Prosperity. And it's beyond my wildest dreams how AFP has grown. The largest tax day tea party in the nation. You can join the tea party action Kill the bill! Kill the bill! Kill the bill! The Democrats call those folks a mob, crazy, even worse, I call them patriots. I agree. It's about patriotism. He's not a natural born citizen. He's surrounding himself with people of his own kind. This president, I think, has a deep-seated hatred for white people. Thanks to millions of Americans who stepped up in town halls and tea parties across this country. He is not going to get his way. He brought a gun to a meeting the president held today on healthcare. Was your gun loaded today? Ah, wow, who would be silly enough to carry an unloaded firearm? This is the beginning of taking our nation back. We're going to take back our government, we can do it in Wisconsin and by God we are going to do it all across America. Oye Oye Oye. All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States are admonished to draw near and give their attention for the court is now sitting. God saves United States and this honorable court. You'll hear re-argument this morning in Citizens United versus the Federal Election Commission. General Kagan. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court. For over a hundred years, Congress has made a judgment that corporations must be subject to special rules when they participate in elections and this court has never questioned that judgment. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. We never questioned it, but we never approved it either. The Citizens United case arose out of a movie made a right wing group Citizens United partially funded by corporate donations denouncing Hillary Clinton. It was made at a time when she was viewed as the leading Democratic candidate for president. Ruthless, vindictive. Venal, sneaky. Ideological, intolerant. Liar is a good one. Scares the hell out of me. I think anybody watching that movie would walk away with the clear impression that the moviemakers were trying to urge you not to vote for her. If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton, wait until you see the movie. They called it Hillary The Movie to ensure that their advertisements would have to name a federal candidate. Congress said, if you are running an ad about a candidate and you're close to the election, you can't have corporate funding, you can't have union funding and you have to list the donors behind those ads. This provides the voters with important information that they are entitled to know about before the election. Would it expedite the visibility of this movie if you were to simply comply with the disclosure and disclaimer law? Well, we would suffer damage if we did that. We would not get contributors who want to contribute to the film, to contribute to the advertising of the film. If we agree to disclosing our donors. Have you actually gotten an expressed concern from donors or it's just kind of a theoretical principal that you're standing on? No, we have expressed concerns. Jim Bopp has been bringing test cases of trying to push the law back and have less regulation. You can even buy a Democrat congressman for $2500. The anecdotal evidence is that it takes $99,000 in cold hard cash. He decided that there was an opportunity with Citizens United to challenge the requirement that the sources of funding of a film like that that advocated the election or defeat of a federal candidate had to be reported to the Federal Election Commission. The case went to the Supreme Court and there were five justices ready to say, this isn't the disclosure case, this is really about whether corporate money can be spent, we think that there is nothing wrong with spending corporate money to advocate the elect defeat of a candidate. And the four justices in the minority said, "Wait a minute, that hasn't even been briefed in this case." The court said, we want you to re-argue this case and argue it bigger. So that was a bit surprising... It was very surprising. It's a very unusual thing for the court to do and it's very activist. Hillary The Movie never made it to theaters, but it's getting a showing this week in front of the United States Supreme Court. Here is the issue. Is it legal to restrict corporate spending on political campaigns? Mr. Olson. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court. Robust debate about candidates for elective office is the most fundamental value protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Yet that is precisely the dialogue that the government has prohibited if practiced by unions or corporations. Mr. Olson, are you taking the position that there is no difference in the First Amendment Rights of an individual? A corporation after all is not endowed by its creator with an inalienable rights. I had attended the oral argument with Senator McCain, we sat together and watched it, and we were very concerned. There are certain judges who are alleging that somehow corporations have the same rights as citizens. I don't accept that premise. In Citizens United versus the FEC, Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the court. First Amendment protection extends to corporations. Political speech is indispensable to decision making in a democracy and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual. Senator McConnell leaned over to me once or twice and said that, is this...is this a very broad opinion, and I said it's about as broad as it could be. The Supreme Court is supposed to give the narrowest possible ruling to resolve the question. Instead, the court just went off the charts. I was standing outside the court, I was really shocked. I was shocked at the arrogance of the court, I was shocked at the fact that they thought corporations were people. The court said that as long as it's independent spending, it can't be corrupting. Give the money directly to the candidate, you can't give more than $2500 per election. Give the money to this super pack out there that is advancing the goals of the same candidate and you can give an unlimited amount of money and some folks are giving millions. It was a huge power grab by corporate America, they succeeded, and sadly the Supreme Court was a tool for their interest instead of being the guardian of our constitution, the guardian of our laws. The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court. The president of the United States. Thank you very much. With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interest including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests. I would like you to do something different, I would like you to bring a check, but not $35,800 on Wall Street, 60 bucks and have your neighbor do that and have a million people do that. And then five million do that and then guess who runs the country, the people do. I thought that's what the constitution said. I thought that's what the declaration of independence said. Well, let me repeat what it says, it says we will not stand the tyranny of a king. We will not live in a country where there are classes of people, the very rich and the very poor. What has America become? This is my woman, I claimed her and I've got an invitation for her marked with a T for Tea Party. You might her as the wife of the Clarence Thomas. Whoa! November 2nd will be a storm in Washington. We are going to come after you so hard you have no idea. Two years from now Barrack Obama is a one term president. ♪♪ If you've maxed out to the senate committee, congressional committee or the RNC and you'd like to do more under the Citizens United decision, you can give money to the American Crossroads 527 or Crossroads GPS. American Crossroads is responsible. Club for Groth Action is responsible for the content. Americans for Prosperity is responsible for the content of this advertising. More than three and a half billion dollars has been spent making this midterm election the most expensive on record. The Republican Governor's Association is targeting swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin and Florida. Let me tell you how excited Republicans across the country are about Scott Walker and what's all he doing here in Wisconsin. In 2010, Wisconsin is going to experience the greatest political tsunami in the country. You are going to lead the way. We can take our government back and take it back we will. The whole new class of Republican governors in critical presidential battleground states. For the Republican, Scott Walker, there is a big gain here now for Republicans in the governor's race in Wisconsin. Tonight I want to tell... Tonight, I want to tell every worker, every family and every business big or small in the state that you have an ally in the governor's office, Wisconsin is open for business. Wisconsin is a good example where the people were overpowered by money. Two brothers, Charles and David Koch were the largest donors to Governor Walker's campaign. KochPAC gave $43,000 to Scott Walker to help him get elected governor. But they didn't stop by maxing out on a direct contribution to Scott Walker, they then gave the Republican Governors Association a million dollars. And the RGA spent 5 million dollars on advertising supporting Walker's election. Well, that was an incredibly important investment that may well have put Walker over the hump. It didn't come out until after the election that Koch Industries had played the role in bankrolling Scott Walker's candidacy. Wisconsin used to have some of the best disclosure laws in the country, some of the strongest campaign finance laws you would find anywhere in America. And now those laws are basically not worth the paper they're written on. That's the largely unknown consequence of Citizens United, is that it is unleashed money that our disclosure laws are not equipped to reveal. The point of it is to find a way to spend money in elections nowadays without telling anyone who you are. And why would you want to do that? Well, that's a good question. It maybe that you just like operating under the radar as they say. It maybe that you have somewhat nefarious motives. Allowing corporations to spend money on elections will always keep it a freer country, but it need not always benefit the country. It may lead to very bad people being elected sometime and it may lead to too much power. On the Supreme Court, we seen an individual such as Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. who conducted himself brilliantly before the Senate Judiciary Committee and soon Chief Justice Roberts will have as his colleague Judge Samuel Alito Jr. In Citizens United, we thought we had a very good argument. The problem was we didn't have a good audience for our argument. One justice retired and with that one switch, what had been a 5-4 majority on the court that was willing to uphold campaign finance laws switch to a 5-4 majority to strike down campaign finance laws. Nothing else in the world had really changed. No, I mean nothing had changed, never mind really changed. That's one of the things that Justice Stevens said on his descent. You know, we don't overrule precedence unless something has significantly changed. And the only thing Steven said that I can see that has changed is one justice on the court has retired and had been replaced by somebody who views it differently. The Supreme Court in front a statue eternally contemplates justice and inside nine men dispense it. When they were in elementary school, we learned that the Supreme Court was the highest court in the land. Well, I discovered in the last year is that the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land has the lowest ethical standards. Justice Scalia and Thomas actually had a conflict of interest on the Citizens United case. Justice Thomas had violated the rules by not filing his financial forms and in voting for Citizens United gave his wife the opportunity to receive a large gift from a corporation to spend politically which she could not have done before Citizens United has passed. Hello patriots! Whoa! She then spent that on ultraconservative candidates that she supported. Justice Scalia appeared before the tea party on Capitol Hill. We were delighted with Justice Scalia... If they were under the judicial code of ethics, they would not be permitted to go to any political party or make any contribution to political parties. If the liberal interest groups and their allies on Capitol Hill want to have a battle, we're ready to go. So with that, we'll show you the spot. When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, he choose a man who grow up poor in a one-room dirt floor shack, but with strong grandparents, a good education, and his own hard work, Clarence Thomas made it and his conservative values show it. But Thomas faces bitter opposition from liberal senate Democrats whose value should be on the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas' or Ted Kennedy's. Call today. President Bush and Clarence Thomas need your help. We're here in Rancho Mirage to report on this conservative fundraiser that's going on. It's a fundraiser/political strategy session with some of the wealthiest businessman in the country to fund the conservative movement. For 10 years, the Koch brothers and their friends have been meeting twice a year at resorts in California and in Colorado. They're inviting all of the conservative legislators from the House and Senate. They even invited Justices Scalia and Thomas to speak to their meetings. They're extraordinarily wealthy. They have fertilizer plants. One of the largest timber companies in the world, a large network of pipelines, shipping fossil fuels around the country. The refineries that specialize in some of the worst types of oil like Canadian crude oil that's high carbon very bad for the environment. Last year, when they had this meeting in Aspen, Colorado, they planned how to take Congress and raise hundreds of millions of dollars plugged it into nonprofits like Americans for Prosperity, so the politicians know where the money was coming from and we've got a brand new Congress elected by these guys. Hi sir, my name is Lee Fang. I'm with the blog Think Progress-- Hey Lee, we're not doing any interview today, we're not doing any interview. What you're expecting from the new congress? Well, cut the hell out of the spending and balance the budget and reduce regulations and support business. Mr. Koch, are you proud of the Tea Party Movement and what they've achieved...? Yeah, like there's some extremist there, but the rank and file are just normal people like us. David, Lee here is a good blogger on the left. We're glad to have him. No more interviews now. Just a quick interview, are you proud of what Americans for Prosperity has achieved this year? You bet, I am. Man oh man. We're going to do more too in the next couple of years, you know. All together, global warming is... Bullshit! In January of 2009, Americans for Prosperity start sending organizers in California, Arizona, Florida, several other states to organize these tea parties to depose the belief in climate change and support key agenda items that Koch Industries has an interest in. And we are going to fight the future, we are about ready to launch the right to work effort in Michigan, AFP is here at the right time for our nation's history. In 2010, after he's elected with tremendous support from Koch Industries and Koch PAC, Scott Walker takes legislation that was written by an outfitting Washington DC, ALEC funded by the Koch brothers and other corporate interest. He takes these model bills from voter ID laws to a tax on worker rights and he's made it his own playbook, and he's put all that policy in place. That's not something that people in Wisconsin were yearning for, it's not something that you heard a hue and cry about. This is an agenda that the less 1% wants. Good to see. Thanks for having us. Thank you. Good to see you again... So what we're going to do and talk about right now, these concerns that Mary and I have are a little controversial to bring upstairs, because there's press up there. Yeah. We'll follow. Any chance we'll ever get to be a completely red state -and work on these unions? -Oh yeah. And become a right-to-work? -Well what... -What can we do to help you? Well, we're going to start in a couple of weeks with our budget adjustment bill. The first step is... We're going to deal with collective bargaining -for all public employee unions. -Right. Because you use divide and conquer. So I need lawmakers to vote on it, but the key is by tying it to the budget, there's no way to unravel that. Huge changes could be on the horizon for public employees as the governor seeks to strip unions of some rights. We're going to have to make changes in terms of collective bargaining even question whether or not you have a public union to begin with. The change would strip bargaining rights from everyone from snow plough drivers to prison guards. The union actually says about 37% of our membership voted for Scott Walker. Everyone knew that he was not union-friendly, but he never said anything about attacking collective bargaining. Mid-term elections went Republican, Republican and Republican. And I am a Republican. What I voted for is not what I got. I did not vote, and this is a harsh word to use, I did not vote for a dictator who would strip me and my colleagues of all the rights. The reaction around school was shock. We didn't know if we were going to have a job the next day, the next month, the next year. It's not just about teachers, it's about our state's history. This can't happen. This is wrong. For snow plowers that take care of the roads. What Walker is trying to do is unfair without giving us a voice. The union is losing ground. They lost 612,000 union members in 2010 alone. Now, think about it, everyone in those 602,000 people had literally, perhaps several hundred dollars worth of union dues going into the political coffers of their union to spend on politics. So yeah, you keep having for half a million people leave the labor movement every year and pretty soon you start having crimp in the political budget so these unions that has a direct effect on the presidential election. He was going to change the world old Walker. I know people were voting for him left and right, and so all of a sudden, have you heard what that governor is doing? If it's just about the budget, we'll give you the pension reform, we'll give you the increase in our healthcare cost, just don't make it about our union. My name is Dee Ives and I'm a veteran of the United States Air Force. I am also proud to say that I work at the veteran's home at King Wisconsin. I am also a Reagan Republican. This bill should not be about party politics people. [CROWD CHANTING] Kill this bill! Kill this bill! I am urging all of our legislators to consider the serious implications to the quality of care that we will be able to provide the veterans of Wisconsin in the home that was established over 120 years ago to protect our veterans. It is 2:50 a.m. at the Republican members of the Finance Committee have said that they are walking out of the hearing. They're adjourning it in their words. [CROWD CHANTING] We will speak! We will speak! We have not heard of ever a hearing ending before every person had the right to speak. That ended here tonight. That is a Wisconsin tradition, we should never allow to end. In Wisconsin today, a game of hide and seek. The state legislature sergeant at arms on the hunt for 14 senate Democrats who fled the state. The reason why we left is this was the only way we could try and get the governor to sit down rationally and talk about this proposal and talk about changes. There is on ongoing negotiations with the Senate Democrats at this point. They need to come back and go to work. The bill is not negotiable. The bill is not negotiable. Wisconsin is ground zero. I think it's going to determine largely whether or not the pampered nature of this public employee unions is finally reined in so that they're paying for healthcare and they're paying for pensions in a level that the private sector is doing. I think this is the ground zero. I don't have a problem at all contributing to my pension plan. In our school district, we already paid 10% of our medical cost, another 2.5% is nothing. These are both of Will's? - Yeah, those are Will's. - Fantastic. Two more student books in. Yey, hurray another one done. I don't think any of the union members have a problem contributing financially to get in the state out of debt. And I guess, we hoped that our elected officials would see that we were willing to meet them halfway. But don't take away my right to negotiate my paycheck. That is not what I voted for you to do. I've got 21 years in with the United States Army, came back and choose to become a correctional officer. As a job that I'm suited for in terms of my personality and the training that I got in the military. You can be required to give more than most jobs. 7:20, 106.7 FM Sly in the Morning, correctional officers, Brian Cummingham and Mark Elliot with me. At one time I thought you guys got to carry guns in those facilities, you don't, all you've got is your walkie-talkie and your brain. That's it. We have 1233 inmates that live in the city block. They all live in their bathroom. Half of them live with another man in their bathroom. Everything that those inmates do on a daily basis were responsible for. That's what we do as a service to the state of Wisconsin and Scott Walker has vilified us. He has made us the enemy when our job is to serve. They're saying they will agree on the cuts, but they feel that the request to eliminate collective bargaining, you know, basically amounts to union busting. Is there no room for compromise if they're willing to give on the financial incentives? Well, for us, we're broke. We're not involved... When Scott Walker announced that Wisconsin is open for business, I did not know at that time that that meant that Wisconsin was open for business at the expense of workers, at the expense of elders who were depending on Medicare benefits for home health services at the expense of people who are already marginal. The young lady from Wisconsin. The governor and I have a really long history, we're friends, I'm crazy about his kids and his wife, but I'm not going to spend my five minutes pretending that we agree on anything. You started out by giving 117 million dollars worth of tax breaks to wealthy people which reduces revenue and in contrast, you cut the earned income tax credit, doubling the taxes on the poorest parents. What in the world does that have to do with balancing a budget? I have here a website, that is supported by the Americans for Prosperity and funded by the Koch brothers. How much have you received in contributions from the Koch brothers. I had 50,000 contributors, I couldn't tell you who they all are. Governor Walker, your proposal would require unions to hold annual votes to continue representing their own members. Can you please explain to me and members of this committee how much money this provision saves for your state budget? We gave workers the right to choose which is a fundamental American right, the right to choose whether or not they want to be a part of the union and whether or not they want up to a thousand dollars -taking out of... -How much money does it save, governor? In particular it doesn't save any... OK, that's right. That's the point. It obviously has no effect whatsoever..., -I'll answer your question-- -I'm reclaiming my time. it obviously had no effect whatsoever on the state budget. To pretend that this is about a fiscal crisis in the state of Wisconsin is malarkey. Seven of the top 10 donors to political campaigns donate to Republicans, the other three all donate to Democrats and they're all unions. This is the potential Armageddon for organized labor, public sector unions as money laundering operations for the Democrat Party. Unions are the only competition Republicans have in electoral politics. Post Citizens United, conservatives look at this and they smell blood. Bust the unions, it's over. Hi, this is Scott Walker. Scott, David Koch, how are you? How are you, David? I'm good and yourself? I'm very well. I'm a little disheartened by the situation there, but what's the latest? We're actually hanging pretty tough. What we're thinking about the crowds was planting and troublemakers. You know, the...well, the only problem with... because we thought about that, my only fear would be is if there was a ruckus caused is that that would scare the public in the thinking maybe the governor has got to settle to avoid all these problems. There's a lot of us new governors who got elected to do something big. You're the first domino. Yup, this is our moment. Yeah. Thirty years ago, Ronald Reagan had one of the most defining moments of his political career when he fired the air traffic controllers. To me that moment was more important than just for labor relations or even the federal budget, that was the first crack in the Berlin Wall and the fall of communism because from that point forward the Soviets and the communists knew that Ronald Reagan wasn't a pushover. Well, I'll tell you what Scott. Once you crush these bastards, I'll fly out to Cali and really show you a good time. All right. That would be outstanding. Now, what else can we do for you down there? Well the biggest thing it would be and your guy on the ground is probably seeing this is after this a lot of these guys are going to need... They don't necessarily need ads for them, but they're going to need a message out reinforcing why this was a good thing to do for the economy and good thing to do for the state. So the extent that that message is out over and over again that's obviously a good thing. Who decides Wisconsin's future, voters or government unions? Wisconsin voted for fiscal sanity and balanced budgets, but government workers fight to keep benefits far better than the private sector. Democratic legislators refuse to show up for their jobs hiding out in other states. And incredibly, President Obama backs the union bosses and floods Wisconsin with out of state political protesters. Governor Walker has the courage to do what's right for Wisconsin. Americans for Prosperity is responsible for the content of this advertisement. That's those are American for Prosperity ads, those are Koch brother ads. ...To all that outside spending, some of it coming from groups that aren't even in Wisconsin. ...Own democracy campaign estimates that a total of 30 million dollars will be spent... -Jesus! -Thirty million dollars, do you think they could find something better to do with 30 million dollars like, maybe the Koch's could pay their taxes and then we wouldn't be in this mess. You know how many homeless veterans that would feed? Thirty million bucks. I am watching my Republican Party implode. ...Clerk call the roll. -No! No! No! -Excuse me. Listen it says, if it's any doubt as to whether good cause exists, the governmental body should provide 24 hours notice. This is clearly a violation of open meetings law. The Republican lawmakers were able to separate the portion of Governor Scott Walker's budget bill that deals with collective bargaining and pass that on its own in the absence of the state's 14 missing Democratic senators. [CROWD CLAMORING] This is about the presidential election in 2012. If we win this battle and the money is not there under the auspices of the unions, certainly what you're going to find is President Obama is going to have a much difficult, a much more difficult time getting elected and winning the state of Wisconsin. If you never voted before, I bet you will now. Madison, these are the front lines in the battle for the future of our country! Mr. Obama, Mr. President, you and your cohorts threw all the hatred and all the violence that you could at these good folks here in Madison, Wisconsin, but you lost here. And Madison, you defended that 2010 electoral mandate, you are heroes, you are patriots. Your historic stand brought down the curtain on the last election and the 2012 election begins here. I would join my brother in expressing my appreciation for your support and presence here this weekend. What I want to do is recognize those partners who had given more than a billion...a million. No... I'm going to go easy on you, more than a million over the last 12 months. If you want to kick in a billion, believe me, we'll have a special seminar just for you. We've had a lot of tough battles. We've lost a lot over the years and we've won some recently, set the stage for, as I said, the mother of all battles coming up a year from November and I've pledged to all of you who've stepped forward and are partnering with us, but we are absolutely going to do our utmost to invest this money wisely and to get the best possible payoff for you and the future of our country. What we need to do is pass the mother of all repeal bills and I would begin with the EPA. And one of the things the Congress should do immediately is defund the National Labor Relations Board. We could rein back the scale of the government and that's the right thing to do. It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone. Commerce, education and the... what's the third one there, let's see... Watch out Mitt, watch out Rick Perry, you watch out, you give me a foot hold in one of these debates, I will tear their breaches up. I'm a farm boy. I'm a small businessman. I'm a family guy. I'm the only guy running who's been a congressman and a governor. Hundred dollar limit. I don't take PAC money, no special interest money. I'm Buddy Roemer, I'm running for president; president of the United States of America. Governor, how are you? Buddy Roemer, how are you? Do you always travel Amtrak, Governor? I do. It's cheap. It's subsidized by the taxpayers. Where is the Secret Service today? I don't have Secret Service man, I've got Carlos from El Paso, Carlos Sierra. You know the first question people ask me because I've been at this for six months or more, day after day, and they say, why haven't you been on the debate? You're the only guy running who's been a congressman and a governor. You're a fairly successful business man and what's the reason you can't get on a debate? And I don't even have an answer for that, I don't know. I called after I had formally announced that I was running for president, and they said, oh, you have to have 1% of the vote. Three weeks later, we were 1%, I called again. And they said, oh, it's 2% now. So we made the 2% mark and we called again and they said, you not only have to have 2%, you have to raise a half a million dollars in the last 90 days. It's big business and there's a place for a big business, but is it in determining who even runs for president? What kind of country are we? He has grounds to feel mistreated by the system and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I don't know who is it who decided time and time again that he shouldn't be in the debates, but clearly, what he wanted to talk about is not what the Republican leadership in Washington wanted to focus on. The politicians don't run the country, the major corporations do. Congress acts like the gates are opened, there's nothing they can do and the president who is not a leader. And I maybe very specific. He is a participant in the fraud. I mean, he signs bank reform, runs to Wall Street the next week, has a $35,000-ticket fundraiser sponsored by Goldman Sachs. Now, that's independent. But Congress could do something. I've given them six things they could do, all they need is courage. I feel a speech coming on, I don't give a... New York. Here's what I want to do with you today. I want to draw the line between the kitchen table issue and money and politics. So you don't have a job, your grandma can't get healthcare, kid can't go to school. Got no fucking heating oil, so I'm going to push you and say -tell me Governor and you just draw the connection. -I'm there. I'm there. Governor, they don't seem to want you in the conversation. This issue as you know Dylan goes much deeper than that. If you have a big check, you stand first in line and I don't call that a representative democracy. Sometimes it's a check, sometimes it's the threat of a check. It's like heaven or weapon. You could shoot the gun or just show it, it works both ways. And money is a weapon. It doesn't add to the debate, it don't increase the number of Americans, it's in the very rich and powerful have more of it than anybody else. Let me put it in another way. They have more guns than anybody. Who wins those battles? I know I wanted to be a teacher in seventh grade. I wanted to make a difference for one child. It was everything I ever wanted. I worry about the young people in the profession, I worry about the students' needs. So even though I feel like I am truly a conservative, truly a Christian conservative, Governor Walker's agenda frightens me. It's made me question whether or not they truly represent me and what I believe in. That's another teacher's home, again opulent. You know, I don't get where regular people have become the enemy. You know, I've served at every level and now you're the bad guy. Next up I have is for Brian Cunningham. I want to thank you for being here today because my voice has been stolen from me. It was hard being a correctional officer 10 years ago, it's almost impossible now. You pay us to go there to do that job, Scott Walker's ACT 10 to just block that job. He said it's about money, let's break the union, let's break the money train to support political parties. It's tough to go and protect the state of Wisconsin every day. Brian, if you were thinking about what were the one or two immediate things maybe that we should focus on to improve safety... Recall Walker. Signature gathering has began in earnest. The signing has started at 12:01 a.m. I can't tell you how many times over the years I've been emailed or called by somebody who is ticked off at a public official. And he said, how do we recall that joker. And I would say, well if it's a statewide office holder, you need 540,000 signatures and it would end the conversation right there. Whoa! Oh, that works good and then we can take it down at night. This is my neighbor Gordy, he lives just down the road from us. Okay... A lot of people say, gee you're Republican, how can you recall a Republican? It's like, Governor Walker is a tea partier. Tea Party and Republicans are not the same thing and I personally do not espouse the tea party principles of cutting government service in order to balance our budget. There. Now we go her done. Yeah, get rid of that guy. Walker is a bully and I was a union man and if it wasn't for the union I couldn't have retired. I had to worked until I was 100. Both my wife and I are county workers and when I took the job, I took a paid cut for benefits and I'm losing my benefits. How have you been doing? Really good. We only have 900 people in this town and we've already got about 50 signatures. You don't pay taxes? -I pay employment taxes... -What are you talking about? Bunch of goons. I pay employment taxes. I pay business taxes. I pay plenty of taxes, sir. What Wall Street did to us is just awful. I think eventually everything comes around, but I'm 80 years old and sometimes I'm not sure it's going to come around, you know, in my lifetime. And there's my hubby pulling up. Hey, baby, come up and see you later. I should be around. One of hunting buddies stop by the other day, he signed here and the other signature is me, but we got two. Two in the big effort multiplied by a thousand other little bike shops like this. There's 2000 signatures, you know. Every part on this motorcycle is American made. My American dream has fallen apart here. That's all big business, the almighty dollar and greed and the corporate monster. That's my opinion, kind of. But I really don't have a reason to whine because I don't vote. A friend of mine, he goes, have you gotten any use for an indoor burner like that? I go, you bet. So he gave it to me. The bartering days are back here again, have been for quite a while in this area. I even make my own cigarettes because of the cost. It makes me sound like a real hillbilly don't it? It's pretty sad. These millionaires, aren't they happy just being millionaires? Do they really have to be gazillionaires? Well, they're just going to keep crushing the middle class, crushing the poor people. And does it bother them? No. Just buy your way into a certain level in politics, that ain't cool. People should run on their merits not how much money that so and so is dumping on their campaign fund. That's their world of bartering. State law will allow Governor Scott Walker to collect unlimited donations to his possible recall campaign. The Governor can raise unlimited cash and donors have flocked. His top three donors are all from out of state. Texan homebuilder Bob Perry gave a quarter of a million dollars, he was the man behind the 2004 swift vote ad campaign against John Kerry. Illinois couple Elizabeth and Robert Uihlein gave $205,000. Third is Wyoming investor, Foster Friess who gave a $100,000. On the democratic side, Washington DC based United Food and Commercial Workers Union gave $20,000. State workers union AFSCME gave just more than $11,000. The unions don't have as much money even in our wildest dreams as the Koch brothers themselves. It's unfortunate and unfair that outside millionaires from Kansas and Texas can dump unlimited amounts of money, but they can also through Governor Walker and the legislature cripple our ability to do the same thing. It's a power grab the change not only the rules of the game, but to try to take us out of the process altogether. Not just the wiping out of public employee unions and collective bargaining rights, but also the Voter Identification Law, the redistricting, all tactical, but tactical with an eye to the next election and the election therefore. There's very little proof of any serious voter fraud anywhere, but so far 31 states have jumped on the Voter ID bandwagon anyway. In Madison, the state assembly is taking up the Voter ID Bill. It was just about a decade ago that I first introduced a photo ID requirement. This has been a long term desire on the part of Governor Walker to limit the electorate for the benefit of, I believe corporate interest. Fifty-five percent of all African-American males in Wisconsin have no photo ID. Forty-nine percent of African-American women have no photo ID. Forty-nine percent of Hispanic men, 59% of Hispanic women and when you get to the 18- to 24-year-old group, 78% of African-American males have no photo ID. You need a photo ID to fly on an airplane. Well, yeah, if you're middle class you fly on airplanes, but guess what, there are millions of Americans that don't fly on airplanes and guess what, you don't have a constitutional right to fly on an airplane. As simple as things like getting cold medicine requires photo ID. Well, unfortunately, healthcare is not a constitutional right, but voting is. Listen to me American, you're unimportant. They don't care about you because you don't bring a check. Welcome back everyone. In Hampshire, will pick who it believes should be the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Mr. Roemer you've been quoted as saying that your GOP rivals for president are "bought and sold." But the bottom line is there are more debates coming and you're not going to be able to get into any of them, right? In New Hampshire, they have two debates coming up that would be nationally televised.. That's my only chance. Buddy Roemer campaigning in the grand state today. I think the rest of them are bullshit. -Nice meeting you. -All right, you too. See you, Easia. I never had barber looked like you. I'm a banker and forgive me for that. Oh, yeah... Let's get the big money out of the room. That's me and you run the country. All right, we could do it. We could do it. You should see how many people are saying, don't give up Buddy, don't give up. He has amazing Twitter. Whenever he gets an audience on some of those national shows, we always get an increase in Facebook likes, Twitter followers and donations. We've only raised about 32,000 last week. It was our best week ever. We're going to Calef's for a sandwiches, anybody wants one. -Buddy. -Buddy, yeah. Buddy. He used to be the governor of Louisiana. Oh! I deny everything. My name is...a Louisiana governor that didn't go to jail.. It's the first time I've given a contribution and it's actually the first time that I'll be voting because I didn't think my vote mattered. I think they're all corrupt. I always think I'd be picking the lesser of the two evils and I guess I saw something in him. We bought two television commercials on the debates. Really? Good. So man, we are flying high. That's good. That's real good. That's awesome. -We're not going to be in the debate. -Yes. But I expect to be proud. I expect to tweet every answer. I expect to give them hell. There are our new poll numbers heading into the final weekend of the campaign. The poll they're using has a margin of error 5.5%. I mean just think about that, 5.5% so if we got 1% that means that we could have gotten 6.5 and would have qualified. Tonight, all eyes on New Hampshire. We put them all to the test. Seven old white men. Governor Romney, we'll begin with you... Ready to be the Twitter of the world, Ms. Jill? Tweeter of the free world. Governor Huntsman, Afghanistan. I believe it's time to come home and I would say... Get him out. Come on John, get a little passion. It's a troubled nation, they're corrupt at the top. It's Louisiana in a bigger stage? Buddy, you know you're as good as these guys. I honor them, but it's frustrating. Bullshit, you're as good as they are. Why is Rick Perry up there and you're not? I don't know. Mr. 1%. I would send troops back into Iraq because I will tell you... Oh, man! I think we start talking with the Iraqi... Texas, they've done a good job for us over the years, please. -Do you know who the largest corporate giver is -This is us? to policy issues in Washington? Goldman freaking Sachs. Go on, buddy! Man. Is bought and sold... They don't want you here... They don't seem to want you in the conversation. Wake up America, they've stolen your government. The highlight of the debate, thus far. Is there any one on the stage you guys will be afraid of having as a president? Why don't you ask an easier question? Is there anyone you trust? Talking to Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin. Hey Rush, great to be with you and your listeners. Signatures are due today, is that right? They said they're probably going to turn in 720,000 today. We don't even know who the candidate is against us yet, the real opponent will be this money coming in from out of state from these government unions. In the end, we're going to prevail, but it's going to take a ton of support. In the last two months, we raised more money than any candidate for governor ever has. Tomorrow morning it becomes official, you're going to be facing a recall in the state. Well, we assume it. I mean, when the national union has got involved, we assumed the money and the power behind it to make that happen. We view our opposition being primarily out of state, special interest money and the bigger government unions. We need to be prepared to get the message out to spread the truth. This is Upfront with Vicki Mckenna. Tim Phillips, my pal, from Americans for Prosperity out, knocking on doors, shaking hands, kissing babies. Tim Phillips, welcome to the show. Vicki, it's always good to be with you. Right now Republicans and libertarians have a voting advantage over Democrats of plus 14 and that's because of the work of groups likes yours. I'm telling you on the ground for the first time in my lifetime we're beating the left. Black liberation and socialism. Have you heard of black liberation before? White European man is evil man and black liberation theology, it's a Marxist form, so-called form of Christianity. And that's what our president... actually he was educated for 20 years in that church. And don't let people tell you that there weren't communism in Hollywood. there were and Ronald Reagan fought those people back in the day. Yes, I love Ronny. I miss him. I miss the Gipper. Now, the ubiquitous socialist fist: I saw everywhere down in Madison, Recall Walker, AFL-CIO, Stand with Wisconsin. The socialist permeate all throughout the unions in Wisconsin and across the country. How is it we go from a republic to now we're all socialist? It's education. It's the culture. There's a culture war going on. It's 1933...1934, who took over Germany? Hitler. And he hated what people? The Jews. And they were all Jews so guess where they came? Here. They came here to Columbia, Madison, Berkeley, they infiltrated. Just like the Fabians of 20, 30 years earlier and they were the teachers of our future teachers. I got to tell you something. If Obama gets four more years and appoints two more justices, I'm telling you we are done dancing as a republic. We've got to stop him. Republicans. Republicans. Tea Parties, turn out June 5th and keep Governor Walker in office and turn out November 6th and keep out Obama. Thank you. I often wondered why our country get so bad, what's causing it, what's right there. You don't realize how it's permeated to the culture. There was a lot of people from my church that came out and I was so glad to see you. I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was that bad. -Just good to have a teacher stand up for what's right. -We need more teachers. He's an inspiration. Totally. I don't think that these tea partiers who are being sold by the river by these politicians taking all their corporate money, really quite realize that in order for what they consider smaller government, they are going to dismantle our social safety nets and that's our grandparents, our parents and some of our children that will not be able to get healthcare, that will not be able to collect their retirements. And I mean, why are they so mad at the unions? Unions gave us the weekend, unions gave us the 40-hour workweeks. Instead of being upset about what the unions have bargained for in their contracts, you would think that they would want to help us bring up everyone's employment so that everyone could have a living wage. She got a couple of death threats over this shit she'd been in and that. We know where you work, we know where you live, watch your car, be careful when you turn the ignition. It was one of these tea party assholes that one was. Did you get on the phone with him or...? No, she's told the guy, you failed to realize my husband is a hairy biker that believes in the castle law. That's what she told him. He was really upset and he was like, maybe you should stop doing this. And I told him and I said, you know, the minute you do that you let them win. I think this is worth fighting for. Honestly, I think America is worth dying for that's why I joined in the military in the first place. The Tea Party sure as hell should not be voting for Scott Walker. Scott Walker took one and a half billion dollars from state employes, he gave it back to special interest groups that is the redistribution of wealth and that does not fall inside the Tea Party objective. When everybody in the state is making $10 an hour, how our any home loans going to happen? How is anybody going to build a house? They want to turn us into India, we'll all be answering phones. People like the Koch brothers have purchased the Republican Party. -30-13? -Yeah. it's not my party anymore. -All right. -It's very presidential. My fellow tax...Americans. If I've said "my fellow taxpayers," I would only be talking to half of Americans. Three, two, one. Last night the Republicans held their 23rd nationally televised debate in this primary election. I have not been invited to a single debate, so today we're dropping out of the Republican Party where I've been a proud member for 21 years and we're becoming an independent. A 100 years ago that great Republican who turned independent, Teddy Roosevelt, he said the Republican Party is now facing a great crisis. It's to decide whether it will be as in the days of Lincoln, the party of plain people or whether it will be the party of privilege and of special interest, we are prepared to challenge both parties who were joined at the billfold they're just alike. Watch us challenge them, watch us put America first. Thanks. Great job, Governor. We got to remember that 98% Americans -have never heard of me. -Yeah. -More than that. -More than that. This is a struggle just to get your name out there. Republicans are fighting for money, time, and volunteers as both a recall and presidential primary elections approach. Have we kept you well-fed in Wisconsin? Uh...Yeah, cheese curds. Calista and I have shares of Packer's stock. Is that what you call yourselves here? Wisconsinites? Governor Walker is one of my heroes. Wisconsin is paying more attention to that race than to this primary. Let's end the civil war, let's restore trust in the government and let's fix this state, let's do it and let's win June 5th. Thank you very much. Let's go get them. How are you going to overcome 30 million dollars that Walker is going to spend in this election? United States won the gold medal in the Olympics in 1980. Thank you guys. Take care. All this money coming into the campaign means you owe a debt to somebody. No, the debt I owe to is the taxpayers, the hardworking taxpayers of the state. I think the people around this state and many around the country, I mean, 76.4% of all my donations came from people giving 50 bucks or less. What did out of state billionaires like Trevor Reese Jones and Bob Perry and Foster Friess and the Koch brothers seek to get from Governor Walker? They've contributed millions of dollars for his campaign. More than 76% of the governor's contribution... -I'm talking about the high dollar donors. -Sure. More than 76% of the governor's contributions have been for $50 or less. -But how about the high dollar donors? -Sure. I'm not in a position to speak for these contributors to the campaign, but what I can tell you is that more than 76% of our contributions have come.. But you're not answering the question. I'll take another question. It's pretty transparent what the labor unions want. What is it of high dollars donors, I'm not talking about the low dollar, I'm talking about the high dollar donors, what is it that they're going to get in return...and what do they hope to get in return? Yeah, interestingly these donors don't have any business in Wisconsin. These are not people who have really a vested interest in the state of Wisconsin, so they don't get anything from this at all. But don't the Koch's own six paper factories and an oil pipeline in Wisconsin? -You've mentioned a number of other contributors. -Sure. Certainly, there are people who have given to Governor Walker who have an interest in the state of Wisconsin. More than $60 million has been spent on this recall effort, nearly 46 million on the Republican side, almost 20 million on the Democratic side. Outside groups have been playing a very big role in all this. Tim Phillips is the president of Americans for Prosperity, a super PAC funded by the Kock brothers, and he joins me here live. It's good to see you. Chris, we're not a super PAC, we're a C4 grassroots organization. How much have you put in Wisconsin? Since January of last year just over $10 million. Ten million dollars. The day after the reforms were put forward in the legislature before the Democrats high tailed it to Illinois, we began running ads and supported this legislation. It's important. We're going to states like Florida and Ohio and Michigan and Colorado, educating folks candidly on President Obama's disastrous economic record and what folks can do about it. If you want to look at how Citizens United is warping politics, there's no better place to look than the state level. We're not only vulnerable from this onslaught of money, we have less ability to know who these corporate spenders are and where they get the funds to pay for all this electioneering. Here's a phone for you. Hannah will tell you how to get into the system. Hi, this is Jeremy. I'm a volunteer for Americans for Prosperity. I just want us to let you know that Mayor Tom Barrett has raised taxes in Milwaukee every year but once since he became mayor. Do you believe that Wisconsin... Governor Walker has saved Wisconsin taxpayers... Thank you very much for your time. I urge you to go to Americans for Prosperity... Do you think in the post Citizens United world, you have more freedom to do what you have? No. It doesn't impact us at all, we don't do election advocacy. Really? Again, the Citizens United did not impacts Americans for Prosperity in no way, shape or form. This is not election advocacy? We're an issue group and we want to make sure that Wisconsin citizens, they've heard our side of the story. But what about your corporate funders? Isn't AFP just another way for them to get money into elections? Yeah, well we don't discuss our funding, but we're... Yeah, I know it's time... We don't discuss our funding. I think this recall process has really torn people apart. I'm worried we're going to wreck the American way by changing up the system. Walker was voted in by the people of Wisconsin. End the recall madness, vote for Scott Walker, June 5th. I don't want big money from out of state with a sleek ad influencing me. I consider myself a fairly intelligent human being and I can figure things out for myself. You up for petting today? I always thought the Republican Party was a part of the people, the common man and that's what I am and that's why I voted Republican. I don't think the party represents what it used to represent. The most important thing that Republican Party stands for that I will support and always agree with is the right to life. And yet, on both ends of the life span, they're doing things like taking healthcare away from the children, they are taking healthcare away from the senior citizens. I've gone over and over and over in my mind and in my heart, about what I need to do at this time that I can square with my conscience. It's been a long, tough, decision-making process. I'll do some thinking and praying tonight. That's how seriously I take it. And Tea Party actually flew me out here, a beautiful airport you guys got. I tell you, I think we hit two ducks and a cow on the way in. God bless this country, I love this country. I noticed there's no dogs around here though, I didn't see any dogs here. Obama had been around lately? Huh? What do you think he frightens me? Yeah, he don't scare me. Yeah, what happened to him? I don't know, it looked like a heart attack. Our election system ain't working because the unions control so much of it. They actually contributed from 1989 to 2011 election, 10. And public employees donated $465 million and the Koch brothers donated 12 million something. Koch brothers are donating 400 million in this election cycle. -Who is? -The Koch brothers. Four hundred million. How do you know that? Read it in paper. Well, you read it the paper, OK. Here! See the back, see what this says here. You know George Soros owns the three major broadcasting companies. The chairman of the campaign to defeat Barack Obama Lloyd Marcus. I am not an African-American. I am Lloyd Marcus, American! Oh look. I have a photo ID. So that confirms that black people are not too stupid to find their way to get a photo ID. This is why we have to vote this racist, divisive administration out of here. ♪♪ ♪ We can't go Barrack, back, back, back, back ♪ It's too late ♪ We're stuck with this Hussein-us ♪ And his spending trillion state ♪ Our children and our grandchildren ♪ They never will forget ♪ How we sold out for a little change ♪ And left them all in debt ♪ We can't go barrack, back, back baaaaak Madison!

It's a decision I can live with and it's a decision between me, my God and my country and God bless America and Wisconsin motto is "Forward" and regardless of the outcome today we do have to move forward. Another day. Another day as an employee of the state of Wisconsin. Go to work. Try not to get stabbed. Try to pay attention. Try to pay attention to what matters. It was stolen by all that big money and the rest of the America, they're coming for you next. Please welcome, Governor Scott Walker. By carrying Ohio, Wisconsin. Michigan, Pennsylvania. 61% of union households backs the president last night. Can we say labor delivered President Obama's second term? Labor absolutely delivered President Obama's second term. We should not all go home and start celebrating. The last time we did that, I put on my rhinestones and my black gown, sweeping the floor and they went into the war room and plan to defeat this president on that very day that we were dancing. So I'm telling you, all the chicken wings are gone, all the Doritos have been eaten, let's get to work. Hey! Hey! Organized labor's suffered a defeat today. Michigan became the 24th right to work state. That causes union members to decline that means fewer dues, that means less money for political actions. Launched in partnership with the same guys who bank rolled Governor Walker's campaign to undermine workers' rights. We fight these battles on taxes and regulations, but really what we would like to see is to take the unions out at the knee so they don't have the resources to fight these battles.
