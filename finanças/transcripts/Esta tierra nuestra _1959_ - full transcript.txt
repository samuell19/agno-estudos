THIS LAND OF OURS Broad is the uncultivated land of Cuba And clear is the justice to open it To whoever uses it and would sidestep whomever Is of no use to it - José Martí Wide is the land, and generous To he who bends over it every day Who ruts its furrows and fills it with seeds Who sinks into it and gives it his daily sweat He who knows that the land is a living thing that returns man’s work And that in it a whole nation can find the strength to develop Wide is the land In it a village can get rich or lose itself Because the land gives the same to one as it does to many And then it all depends on mankind He who daily works the land Who knows it well Knows that the land is wide and generous That it extends far beyond where he can see But he also knows that before him There have been other men who have handed it down From the land comes our primary riches Sugar, for example, whose sale in a single market has depended almost exclusively on the rhythm of our economy Sugar that, when released from the plant goes through a complicated stock market mechanism that determines how many times a man from our village can eat a day. Sugar with its time of harvest and time of rest Our primary wealth arisen from the earth But on the land man has also erected fences of all kinds large and small And each ends in a certain type of land ownership There are large swaths of land in the hands of few This is called latifundio And there are many landless campesinos This is called our people’s misery In the field are sometimes unending fences that demonstrate the precise limits of the latifundios Fences that surround large tracts of someone else’s land And while a large portion of our people go hungry Not all of this land is used as a source of wealth for the nation Sugar companies control 1,880 hectares (or 188,000 caballerías) of land Right now, half of this land would suffice for a normal harvest Cattle ranches control about 3,000 hectares (300,000 caballerías) While less than half of this land would provide for that amount of cattle But on the other side of these fences The people are different On the other side of the fences Men who have nothing must do the hardest jobs To simply avoid dying of hunger The latifundio results in some striking figures: The average income per person among farm workers is 25 cents a day 44% of these people have never attended school 91% are clearly malnourished 11% drink milk, and only 4% eat meat 84% live in homes with dirt floors and roofs made of guano And the vast majority of the rural population suffers On the other side of the fences Our economy stagnates The latifundio is the reason that we spend an average of 150 million pesos annually importing food products that could easily be produced in Cuba That would mean work for many unemployed Cubans The latifundio is the reason that the land is not used in all its productive capacity On the other side of the fences farm workers only find work for part of the year The low purchasing power of the population prevents the creation of new national industries Of new sources of work In Cuba there are more than 700,000 unemployed and under-employed Sometimes, for the campesino to work a piece of land To occupy land that rightfully belonged to him must do so under the cover of night because it was land stolen from the state by large companies It is easy to prevent the campesino from building his ranch on fenced land However, it is not quite so easy to evict him once he has already established a home and has worked a piece of land To do it the law must be ignored But it is already known that the law in Cuba is only applied when it is convenient for the powerful For the campesino, happiness is always fleeting And the simple evils have lasted more than 100 years It is without a doubt that if the entire nation has suffered the consequences of inadequate land distribution If the entire nation has suffered the consequences of the latifundio It is the guajiro who has suffered the most directly And who has also most directly fought to overcome them These things have been happening in Cuba at any time and any place in our countryside The culmination of the fight for land The culmination of the struggle between campesinos and landowners The culmination of the fight against misery, against unemployment, against injustice, against theft, against shamelessness The culmination of the struggle of the peasants of Realengo 18 of the merchants of Casanoa, of Las Mámoas and of countless other places That was going to find their natural path in the Revolution, in the armed insurrection The campesino joins the ranks of the rebel army And from there he will demand his right to life The blood fee to be paid would not be little The dictatorship respected neither women nor the elderly nor children. 7 years of oppression 7 years of struggle, of death, of suffering But at the end the people united defeats tyranny And makes the triumph of the revolution possible Now the land this land of ours, watered with the blood of so many people Will have a better fate No more idle land No more men without work No more landless campesinos No more violence in the fields to impose the right of force against the weakest The people are already beginning to build the foundations for a more rich and just future And that is called Agrarian Reform The land has to be newly redistributed and used in all its producing power Above races, ideologies, and religious creeds The people have come together to defeat misery And the campesino is not alone Along with him an entire nation has grown and become stronger Now the soldier is also of the people And his strength is his reason Now all will march united along the same path to exercise their right to life And to defend it with their death if necessary END
