"Frontier Bad Man 1943" The end of the Civil War caught the North with a crisis of lack of cattle, the same problem that the nation faces today. Then in 1869, the answer came from Texas: A cattle crossing never before seen in history. left towards the North, by the path of Chisholm, Texans crossed their herds for more than 1,000 miles through droughts, floods, hostile Indian lands. The objective was the growing city, full of game rooms and corrals. ABILENE, KANSAS It's good to be back in civilization, huh, Jim? I don't know, Steve. We’ve been gone so long, that this city is scaring me. It doesn't scare me. I brought my revolver. Hey! Why are they crossing a herd of this size, down our main street? You should bring them in the back. We have no way now to become Sheriff. Why didn't you put a sign? We are from Texas. I didn't know that Texans could read. Some may not know, but we know how to count. Hey, Steve. Problem ahead. It seems to be a beautiful girl. This kind of problem I like. I'm sorry, ma'am. We took the wrong path. That seems obvious to me. The scenery on this path is very beautiful, huh, Jim? It doesn't look attractive to me. You are not looking from where I am. I'll see you again. Texans know how to judge a landscape, dear. It's the first time I've seen a girl treating you like that, Steve. It happens from time to time. She must be the governor's daughter. It will be okay when I formally introduce myself to her. We can take 5 cows for every 100. This hick is not counting. How are the numbers? Exactly 400. Okay, Slim? Yes, exactly 421. And there's no point in arguing. As I told the sheriff, Texans may not be smart, but we know how to count. - I'm sorry, young man. - It's all right. Hey. Aren't you the man who brought the herd down the wrong street this afternoon? - I see that I am... - I want to thank you, on behalf of traders for stimulating trade. Stimulate trade? As well? My clients were unable to leave because of the cattle. So they continued to spend money to pass the time. I'm sorry for what we did. Can I buy you a drink? I never drink. It's bad for the stomach. - Hey, are you a pastor? - No, this is my establishment. Your establishment? I've been looking for you. Jim is at the hotel. Paying the boys. I was the first. - As always. - You said you'd come when it was over. Hey, this place is cool. Hey, isn't that the governor's daughter? Or are people alike around here? It's all yours. See you. Let me advise you not to play against professionals. - The game can be manipulated. - That's what makes it fun. - How about we have a drink? - I never drink. Did you come from Texas just to look at the scenery? Why not? The view is worth it. The view is the same from there. $ 100 to enter, no limits. It is good for me. A guitar. I wanted to know how to play that. Over here, we call it the guitar. Guitar? Great. I learn more in my life before I die. See you later, friend. $ 50. I think I will raise $ 100. - Step. - Paid out. Paid out. - Two small pairs. - It wins me. I've lost. Isn't it better to wet your throat? I will play with these cards. $ 25. I bet $ 100. - Step. - Step. Paid out. Scotch Flush. My grandmother always told me to bet on that hand. You are very lucky, Texas. Yes, he is. I open. Step. Paid out. How much is there, Texas? - $ 527. - I'll bet that. It is better to exchange my chips. I didn't like that game. - What's the matter with him? - Are you calling us a cheater? Is not it. It's just too easy. Checkers court. I just like games that are hard to win. It may be difficult, but not impossible. I never knew an impossible game to win. I don't think you know what you're doing. The Texan is very smart. I never saw that. Do you know what you did? - You passed 4 cold ladies. - 5 cold ladies, Slim. There were four. Five, including the governor's daughter. - One beer. - You and the governor's daughter. Serve us the drink. Hello, Marvin. Hello, Reynolds. Prepare the receipt that I will pay you. It doesn't seem right to sell my cattle for $ 11 each. $ 11 per head in Abilene and $ 23 in Kansas City. - If this is not theft, what will be? - $ 23 per head in Kansas City? - Do you know what you're talking about? - I only know what I read in the papers. Hey, what is that? I spent 4 years raising a herd, I traveled 1,000 miles through indigenous territory, and will I earn the same as the man who buys it to send to the market? - This is stealing to me. - Not just for you. Pay no attention to him. Abilene's price is $ 11. Of course it's $ 11. Want to know why? We cattle buyers from the Eastern market, we cannot negotiate with you, cattle farmers, directly. Why can't they negotiate with livestock farmers? Why is there an intermediary. He buys from the creators, and we have to buy from him. He cannot compel them to buy from him. Some of the buyers thought that too. We found one after another, dead in alleys. You're talking too much, Marvin. You wouldn't be threatening him, would you? I do not. I'm just trying to help you. Who is this intermediary whom you fear so much? I would like to meet you. If we knew, do you think we would let him get away with it? He works in disguise through agents. You can track it by your agents, can't you? No, no. He lets everyone buy at his price from time to time. Nobody knows who works for him and who doesn't. Very smart, huh? It seems to me that it can be exposed... Don't worry, my friend. I intend to take care of that. Was that a shot? - Do not wait. - Who fired that shot? - Someone across the street. - Did you recognize him? - It was too dark. - Is he badly hurt? - There's not much hope, sheriff. Take him to the doctor. Give me another one. Did you see what I meant? Yes. I'm afraid so. The price is $ 11. I'm thinking of paying $ 12 just to see what happens. - You already saw what happened. - Someone has to start fighting. I'll give you $ 12. Aren't you asking for trouble, son? It will be worth it if you can expose the boss. I can't give up that extra dollar. I admire your courage, but it is better to stay away from dark streets. Thanks. Make the receipt for Steve Logan. That's me. - Here it is. - Steve. - We got $ 35,000 for the herd. - Well, we'll need the money. Mr. Courtwright, meet my partner, Jim Cardwell. - How are you? - Hi. Make a $ 30,000 payment order to Mr. Courtwright. - What? - A money order. - We'll buy his pack. - We'll buy... hey, are you crazy? He's been acting crazy all night. He wasted 4 ladies... The cattle are worth $ 23 in Kansas City. It does not matter to me. We are creators, not traders. - Listen, Jim, this is our chance... - This is your chance to stay here, instead of going home and raising another herd. - Now, let's eat. - Jim, this is business. Promise. I should slap you. What's your full name, Mr. Courtwright? Make the order for Chris Prentice. I'm just in charge of the ranch. I don't want to create a problem between you two. Do not worry. It’s always trying to sink, and I always save you. But, Jim, this time, it's different. Someone has control of the market, and it has to end. Who told you that story? The man they just loaded from here. - He was shot for telling me. - That's true? It seems so. If they manage to keep the price at $ 11, they can win triple. And goodbye Texas. That is reason enough to do that. But that is not why you did it. You just want a chance to fight, and I knew that I would not leave unless I was forced. Let's go to your camp. Stay here and tell the guys where we went. I don't like this city. It is very dark, and I'm a very big target. Get a hiding place. If I find one that I can fit in, I'll do it. Give me a whiskey. Wait a minute. The last man who did this, was shot when he left this door. Let's try the back door. They went out the back to pick up the horses. - In what corral? - I do not know. How far is your camp, Mr. Courtwright? - 6 or 8 miles away. - I am happy with that. I am so hungry that I would eat a horse. Caution! Take this to camp. Tell Chris to cash it out. Go back to Texas. - Dead? - Yes. - We caught one of the men. - The other ran away. - Who started this shooting? - The head of intermediaries. We bought Mr. Courtwright's cattle without his permission. - Him again, huh? - Ask your men to take care of him. Saddle your horse. You better come with us, Slim. It's all right. Get them, boys. As I was telling you, I showed you how to shoot the rifle, so I fired my revolver so fast that the last bullet, arrived before the first. So I took the rope... Hey, did I tell you what the governor of Chihuahua told me? - You talk too much. - Yes. - The governor told me... - You talk too much. Listen. I know the sound of those hooves. It's Mr. Courtwright coming home. It's not Courtwright. There are three men. Three man? Hello. Can we get closer? Who are? What they want? We are cattle breeders. We have business with your boss. Come, but keep your hands away from your weapons. Both may be ranchers, but the other looks like a bandit. Yes, man, we are ranchers in the South. You are mistaken about Slim. He's not a thug, he's a cowboy. The best in the state of Texas. You are looking at the best in the United States, Mexico and Texas Chinito Galvez. Have you heard of Galveztown? It was my grandfather. And the governor of Chihuahua, and all... - Where can we find Prentice? - She should be back by now. Is coming. These srs. they want to talk to you. They were waiting for you. A girl. This makes things difficult. - Good night. - Good night. - Did you want to see me? - Yes, we did. - About what? - Good... We met your manager in town and bought your pack. - Didn't he come back with you? - Not him... He told us to give you this money order. Wow. That's great. What stain is that? Looks... He is... - Seriously injured? - Good... As serious as possible. - Courtwright is dead? - We got one. The other ran away. This is a very big price to pay for it. The herd will be ready in the morning. - Good night. - Good night. What will you do now? I'm going to town to find the man who killed Mr. Courtwright. How will you do that if you don't know who killed him? Damn it. Why did you remind me of that? - I can't do anything now. - Forget. Forget. I'm sorry I mentioned it. You know, Mr. Slim, I don't think I'm going to like you very much. I wish you hadn't said that. I won't be able to sleep now. He's too small to take care of himself. Yes. I know how you must feel about Courtwright. You better do what he said. Take the money and go home. Without revenge for his murder? - He never disappointed me. - But, what can you do? You don't even know where to start looking. - I can try. - Abilene is a difficult city. - It's no place for a girl. - My house won't be... without him. He was everything I had since my parents died. Him, Chinito and Cherokee. Well, the pack is fine as I said, ma'am. I will help you. And I will decide later what to do. Let's go. How tasty. You'll see what chicken is when you eat it. And what can I do with my gun. My friend, Cherokee, can do with a knife. The best knife thrower you'll ever see. Show him. And I know how to use the rope. Not bad, huh? What did I tell you? If you can't handle something with the knife or revolver, I can handle it. - Very good. - Coffee. With pleasure, sir. If you can't get rid of a problem, let me know. Fat guy. It's the first time I've met a fat man I don't like. He brags a lot. Calm down, boy. I notice that you have a lot of practice with animals. Thanks. I've been taking care of horses since I was a girl. I've never practiced taking care of girls, but I'm willing to try. Can go. I'm not used to it, but I think I can learn to like it. It is the first time that I see that look, my old friend. This is the first girl that really interested me. - With that dirty nose? - She's not your type, that's all. I think she's beautiful. Maybe you're right, if she gets a little dressed. I think she's beautiful no matter what she wears. Look, Steve. Do not even think about it. Are you telling me to stay away from her? No, nothing like that. Well, I've seen you around girls before. Listen, if you want to go after Chris, you better be serious. I'm always serious. At the time. Look who's coming. Hey, Steve. What did you do in the city last night because the sheriff is coming? One thinks that there is law in the city, the way it always appears. Hello, men. Who owns that cattle? Me and my partner. Because? Lindsay here said that you are not allowed to use this pasture. I didn't know we needed permission. I own this pasture. This is different. How much are you charging? $ 1 per head. $ 1? $ 0.20 would be stealing. The land is mine and this is my price. Will you support that? What can I do? If he says they are invading, the law says I have to move them to public land. It's all right. We will go to a public land. Where do you think you'll find this? Lindsay controls the land for miles around. It might be better to take them back to Texas. Slow down, Steve. Slowly. We'll move them, sheriff. - I'm sorry, men. - So do we. I'm serious. I don't like this job, but I'm stuck with it. I didn't know that Texans gave up so easily. You are jumping to conclusions. - What do you have in mind, Jim? - This is weird. $ 1 per head. That's the difference we pay for this herd. Hey, you're right. That means Lindsey is the head of the group. No, no... The boss is too smart to work openly. - Lindsay is just an agent. - I do not know. - But we'll find out. - we'll find Lindsay later. Our job is to move these cows. Get your horses, boys. Hey. Who is this "public land"? I know her? Sure. It is the land of the people. People? Which people? Us, you and me. You know, like roads and schools. - We are all owners. - Me too? Of course. - But I never paid taxes. - They'll catch you. Our Lady. - Whose are they, Red? - I have no idea. I've never seen that mark before. Logan and Cardwell. So this herd must be theirs. I thought you got rid of them. - I got rid of it. - I am seeing. You better get in, Lindsay. I don't want to be seen with you right now. - Hello, Ballard. - Hello, Logan. - Your cattle? - For sure. - What is happening? - Just look. You'll find out. I wonder what they want. - I can stop them. - Not yet. I want to see what they're up to. Get out of here. Get out of here. Hey! - Get those cattle out of here! - I did not understand. Don't understand, huh? - Hey, did he say he doesn't understand? - He doesn't understand English. - Tell him what I said. - I do not understand spanish. - Whose cows are they? - Do you speak the indigenous language? - No, I do not speak! - Bye. - Well, so far, so good. - Yes. Get out of here. Get out, you worm. Skirt. You too. There's no reason... Hey, you guys, get the cattle out of my store. They ate half of my straw hats. You will have to speak to the sheriff, madam. He was the one who told us to bring them here. - What do you mean by that? - You told us to put them together on public land, sheriff. This was the only one we found. So it's your fault, isn't it? Wait until reelection day. Wait a minute. Let me explain. You can't do this to me. Get that cattle out of here. - Where will we put it? - It does not matter to me. - But get them out of here. - I'm sorry, sheriff. But Lindsay owns the land for miles around. We don't want to invade his land. I think we'll have to keep them until we sell, sheriff. For the love of God. Sell ​​quickly. He got upset. They are smart. - I can still stop them. - No. I'll tell you when it's time. Gentlemen, attention, please. Are you buyers from the Eastern market? I repeat. Is anyone buying cattle for the Eastern market? Of course. Because? Here's your chance to buy straight from a rancher, instead of the man who is trying to monopolize the market. The auction will start with $ 12. And the highest bidder will win. Heard $ 12? We cannot make an offer. We would be killed. They will not die. They will not dare to shoot. Prove he's wrong. A shot will dismantle the cattle and the city will be destroyed. And they know it. - He is right. - Yes, he left us with no way out. Come on, Mrs., Who will be the first to end their monopoly? - Did I hear $ 12? - I'll risk it. - I'll start the bid at $ 12. - He said $ 12. A man who cannot be bought. Does anyone give $ 13? Come on, gentlemen. Offer $ 13. - $ 12.50. - He said $ 12.50. $ 13. Offer $ 13. - What's going on here? - Logan is using a trick against the middlemen and I don’t think they’ll like it. I bet that will worry Texas to the death. This is very likely. Very likely. $ 13, that's it, gentlemen. Offer $ 16. Does anyone give $ 16? - Does anyone give $ 16? - $ 15.50. $ 15.50. Does anyone give $ 16? - $ 16. - He said $ 16. - Anyone give $ 17? - $ 17. He said $ 17. Does anyone give $ 18? Come on, gentlemen. Place your bids. - Who gives $ 18? - I'll give you $ 18. - And that's my limit. - $ 18, that's his Limit. Does anyone want to beat his limit? Who will give $ 19? Come on, gentlemen. Look at this herd. Who will give $ 19? $ 18, I give you a... $ 18, I give you two... $ 18 was the final price. Sold to the top hat gentleman. - What's your name, sir? - Jerry Kimball. Mr. Kimball, I'll meet you in the corral. Silence, gentlemen. Silence. It may also interest you that I have a clue about the man, behind the middlemen. Accompany Chris to the hotel. I have to take these cows to the corrals. Sure. We will order dinner for you. I will be there. Even Chris. What did he mean by having a clue about... Chango, are you sure they didn't recognize you, that night in the barn? - No, it was too dark. - Marvin could have... No, he was dead. So they only have one clue. Those guys are smart. They must have thought they would find me through you. Perhaps. But it won't make a difference, because I don't speak. I'm not so sure. If they catch you alone... You better get out of town for a while, Lindsay. - Because? - Get out! Keep moving them, boys. Steve. - Don't be late for dinner. - Leave it to me. From the way you handled that sale and everything, I think it is... Well, it's wonderful. I've never met a girl who didn't think so. Steve can't help but show himself. This is a beautiful way to talk about your partner. I didn't mean that. What I meant, was that Steve is like that on the outside, on the inside, he's normal like me. Only he is better at this than you? I've been told that before. He is not here. Look at the other saloons. I'll stay here if he shows up. - Can we eat first? - Later, Slim. You are always hungry. - Logan, congratulations. - Thanks. I want to thank you again on behalf of Abilene's merchants. - There's no reason to thank me. - That's a matter of opinion. I only hope to be present when I expose the head of intermediaries. Maybe I can do that. Aren't you risking playing cards with a professional? It's not that hard to beat me. You don't look as unhappy as I thought you would be. Why would I be unhappy? You like difficult games. The ones here must seem very easy for you. Are you talking about cattle, I suppose? I didn't know I was playing another game. We can play with each other, can't we? Yes, I suppose we can. But not now. I've been looking for you. Where have you been? - Did you forget about our dinner? - No, but I can't go now, Jim. See you later. It's fine with me, but Chris won't eat without you. But this is important. I'm looking for Lindsay. I am seeing. Come on, boy. You promised. It must be difficult for you to have a partner who is a man of his word. Yes it is. But I always find a way. See you later. But, Jim, there's a lot to do to waste time on the dirty nose. Do you see what I mean? Abilene's scenery is very beautiful. Did you really like it? I was afraid I was going to hide that I'm from the country. Well, what... It's Chris. Hey, come down here. Let me take a good look at you. You are beautiful enough to be held. Don't even try, Steve. Perhaps it is better to choose a table, if there is any left. Tell me. How did you get the dirt off your nose? With a sponge. But you shouldn't ask. Sir, are you Steve Steve Logan? It's me. What's it? A man asked to deliver this to you. - My partner will take care of that. - Just a minute, Steve. - Don't forget what I said. - What did he mean? Anything. It's just a joke. - On here. - Aww thank you. You know, the first time I saw you, I told Jim that... - What did you say to Jim? - I... I said to Jim, "There is a girl who has everything a man..." I'm sorry that we can't eat with you this time. It's from Slim. "Steve, we took Lindsay out of town." You and your knife. I already did this with the whip, and I know I can do it again. The knife is better. To kill, yes... I don't care which one. - We want him to tell you everything. - Like this? You didn't get it right. I'll talk to this gringo. On here. Cherokee. Hit further down. Right here. My friend, don't you think it is better to tell us what we want to know? I don't get scared that easy. Do not say. Hey, Cherokee, behind this ear. Show Mr. Gordinho how to shoot. You know, my friend, the man is smart, that gets scared instead of dying. Now. Didn't I tell you? Hey, Cherokee, you have a crooked eye. You don't see well. I told you to hit lower, not higher. - Hit it here. - Hey. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! - And I? - Wait a minute, chubby. I think it’s better to cut it, after the Cherokee pierced it. I will start now. Show the place. Wait a minute. I will choose the place. Go stand in front of a cigar store. Let me take care of that. Go. You know, I think Mr. Lindsay has a lot of buttons on his vest. Do you think you can hit them? Once, I hit a bee nest and all the bees that came out. Do you have a stinger too? Very good. Hit another one. You and your knife. Two buttons, huh? Now it's your turn, Cherokee. Hit the ear. Unless you tell us what we want to know. I know someone who will kill me if I speak. Who? - He doesn't want to talk. - You're wasting time, Chinito. He knows he won't kill you on purpose. Why don't you try to switch weapons, guys? Change weapons? He doesn't know how to whip. - I don't know how to throw a knife. - This is the idea. - Anything can happen. - Anything. Give me that knife. I don't know how to use it, but I will try. Up there. Up there. The first time I saw you, I knew I wouldn't like you. Crazy. Here, Cherokee. The third button. No. No. Let me help you. Wait. I will say. I'm glad you will speak before we are both killed. We just want to know who controls your land. - Ballard. - Ballard? Hey, Slim, have the sheriff arrest you as a witness. Right. Cherokee and I will go with him. - Jimmy and I will take care of that. - We'll take good care of him. My God. They killed him. Damn it. He ran away and locked us up. Coyote. In between. Come in, gentlemen. Close the door please. I don't like wind. Why did they take? I thought they would arrive sooner. - Were you expecting us? - Was. I know they tried to get Lindsay to talk. - You know that... - Of course. The only problem is that they didn't find out early enough. I suppose he said that I am the head of the intermediaries? - Do you admit it? - Why not? Why not? Put it on. You will go to the sheriff's office with us. - For what? - To be tried. It is not a crime to control the livestock market. This is just good business. It is not a good deal to have others killed. Who said anything about that? Lindsay can tell many things in court. - He will be detained until trial. - Dead man doesn't testify. That shot we heard. It is your word against mine. But you are smart. I have room for men like you. Together, we can make a fortune in this state. - No way. - What do you suggest? - Stay out of the cattle business. - Yes. We may not be able to prove that you did. But from now on, if something happens to a buyer or a herd, we will solve this in the bullet. Well, I hoped to resolve that peacefully. Since I can't... - Take their weapons. - Turn around. Let's go. Turn around! You better do what he says, guys. You guys are smart enough to work for me, but not enough to be against me. Right. Throw them over the balcony, and start shooting. I have several witnesses, that they were trying to rob me. Drop your weapons. What are we going to do, Steve? Did we kill them? No, we will lock them here. Let's go. Do not forget that it is worth what we said. Ballard wanted to be around, when we found the head of the middlemen. What did he think of that? We will have to take it down. Wait! I don't want them to know that I was locked up in my own office. Try to open it. That calls for a celebration, doesn't it, Jim? I don't know, Steve. I'm afraid he's not finished yet. I'm starting to wish those two Texans, had not come to Abilene. - I regret what we started. - Because? He would not dare to act after what he admitted up there. He's a powerful man here in Abilene. He knows that they will not believe our word against his. He cannot take any chances. I'm not so sure, Steve. I don't think he will be defeated, until someone forms an independent sales group. Maybe I'm right. Yes. Yes! Your boss is locked up there. It is better to release it. Cattle buyers, can I have your attention, please? - Take it easy, Steve. - I know what I'm doing. They know Abilene's reputation with cattle buyers. I showed you this morning that they are not that dangerous. I made a sale in front of them and nothing happened. Yes, but they had their hands tied, didn't they? If I can do it once, I can do it again. And I propose to continue doing this, as long as they support me. We all agree with you. But how will you do that? We will organize an independent buyer association. We will make it possible for ranchers to auction off their herds. No interference from anyone. The idea is a good one. But what about their gunmen? We'll take care of that too. We'll have the sheriff appoint helpers to keep order. Do you think it will cover the costs? It won't cost him a cent. My partner and I will pay their wages. Curse. This happens right after the intermediaries failed me. Just a minute, partner. What do you think of this man? - He was always honest. - That's enough for me. We'll lend you enough to get back to business. Hey, I have something to say about that. Okay, Jim. Go ahead. Say it. Think... - I think I have to agree. - You won't regret it. Curse. I will bring a beautiful herd. Good. Closed. I liked what he said. I bet he can do that. What do you think, men? Should we support him? Of course! - Thanks. - Look, Steve. Well, I should have left earlier. I just made history, when organizing a group of independent buyers. Splendid, my boy. That's what Abilene needs. I thought I would be happy to hear that. Okay, guys. The drink is on me. Of course, it will look better when we fix everything. There will be an auctioneer selling cattle... - Where's Steve? - It must be creating more problems. And here we will have a telegraph operator getting prices from the Eastern market to put in that... He said he would meet me here and take me to dinner. - Who? - Steve. He must have forgotten. You are more likely to be doing business. I've never seen men so similar look so different than the two of you. Well, we act differently, but we like the same things. You, for example. The morning after we met you, we were talking about you... Did you and Steve talk about me? What did he say? Well, I told him I thought she was beautiful... I know, but what did he say? Nothing very definitive. Just something about going after you... - And I... - Steve said that? Something like. And I told him... Well, I don't know why he didn't tell me that. You like Steve a lot, don't you, Chris? Of course. Everyone likes Steve. But, you a little more than the others, perhaps? Well... maybe. Then get him out of Abilene and take him to Texas. To Texas? And give up what he did here? This city is not good for him. Nor is this joke. I joked... Do you think setting up this cattle market is a joke? As far as Steve thinks, it is. I know him. He will end up defeated. I'm sure you'll be happy to know how you feel about him. Steve told me he would find you here. He asked to tell you that he changed his plans. What is he up to now? I just put him on the train to Kansas City. He will find some buyers. Why such a hurry? He didn't have to do this until next month. Of course, I don't know anything about it. He only told me to warn Miss. Prentice, that I wouldn't be here to take you out to dinner. Steve must have been wrong. Chris will have dinner with me. Well... So everything is settled, isn't it? Did you see what I said? ABILENE BOLSA DOS RANCHELROS WELCOME, BUYERS OPEN LAUNCHES Excuse me. Another order. You know, Chris, the best thing I did was go to Kansas City. It changes a man's perspective. And this is what Jim needs. - Why are you looking at me like that? - I was just thinking about something. Steve, now that the bag is working properly, how much longer do you intend to stay in Abilene? As long as the money keeps coming in. Because? Don't you miss Texas? Texas for me just means hard work. But you finished what you wanted. You have established a safe market for Texas cattle. I finished? I haven't even started yet. I intend to expand the business. I plan on moving to St. Louis or Chicago one day. What do you think about this? I wouldn't like that, Steve. My place is on a ranch and Jim thinks yours is too. - What does he know about that? - I wonder. I know he thinks you're growing too much... It seems to me that Jim has been talking too much. He has. He fears he is on the way to a big fall. And I'm starting to agree with him. I've been thinking for both of us for many years. I think I will survive without him meddling in my private affairs. Let's take a cart ride. Hey, Texas. Going somewhere in particular? No, I'm just taking a walk down Smoke Hill Creek with Chris. Great. I've been wanting to visit the Turtles. You can leave me there if you want. Of course. Hey, Chris. Climb. I'll drop Claire off at the Turtles. Yes, do it. I will make space for you. No thank you. I changed my mind. Change again. Goodbye, Steve. You talk about settling in St. Louis, Chicago or New York, but, aren't you forgetting something? What? Perhaps your wife has something to say about this. I will not marry. I like to do things my way. I bet you will get married before leaving Abilene. - You will lose your money. - Really? You weren't very happy when Chris didn't want to come with us. I still want to bet. - There's nothing between Chris and me. - You still pay attention to her. - Because? - Because she's Jim's girl. They were born to each other. They want to live on a ranch, raise cattle, chickens, other things. Jim is crazy about her. But he never had the courage to declare himself. Unless it makes you jealous. - You really like Jim, don't you? - If I like it? He's the best partner a man can have. It takes a while to start, but when it starts... By the way. Let's talk about you. - How did you become a croupier? - My story is short. My father died broke, like most players. He taught me everything he knew. I had no one. I want the opposite of you, Steve. I don't want to go to a big city. I want to live on a ranch and raise animals. Well, I didn't say I didn't like life on the ranch. I just said... Where does the Turtle family really live? Turtle family? Turtle? I don't know anyone by that name, Steve. $ 17. $ 17.25. Paid $ 17.50. $ 17.75. $ 18. Sold to Jim Cardwell for $ 18. - When will you get it? - I'll get it this afternoon. Right. Beer. Jim Cardwell bought another large herd. IT IS? - Did you pay a good price? - You paid more than everyone. He will catch the pack this afternoon. This is what I expected, Chango. - Red, take your men... - I'll do it. You will stay in the city with me. Follow the trail. A mile from the herd... - Looks like he's going to ride. - I will go. And a very long one. I will return to Texas. Where is my place. Not until I find out what upset you. Hey, what's all this about? - Are you crying. - Yes, I was crying, cursing and tearing things up. - Because of Steve? - Yes. This is over now. I will come home. - You love him, don't you, Chris? - I do not know. I think so. Anyway, I thought I even loved... Oh... Jim. Jim, I've been acting like a fool. Take me away from here. I don't belong here, just like you. No, it will be all right. Steve told me that the day he heard that I wanted to marry you. - Did you want to marry me? - Well, yes, I... Yes of course. Is there anything wrong with that? A man can dream, can't he? I feel like I'm going to talk to Steve. - I don't want you to talk to him. - It does not matter to me. I'm tired of being sent. From now on, I will give some orders around here. But, Jim... I told you to sit and wait for me until I get back. Who would say. The only thing wrong with Jim is that he refuses... Speaking of the devil... - I want to talk to you, Steve. - Speak. - I want to talk to you alone. - Later, Jim. - I'm busy now. - Me too. I can not wait. - He looks like a "bossy", doesn't he? - You must be angry. Is what it seems. Where will we go? - The billiard room is empty. - It's all right. I just bought a big herd, Steve. Slim and I will get it. You don't need my help to do that. No, we can bring it and send it. So me, you and Chris are going back to Texas. - Gone mad? - Not. There is nothing to keep us here, now that the stock exchange can work alone. This means a fair market for livestock. Our business is to create them, not to trade them. I like it here, Jim. And I intend to stay. - Does Chris like it here? - What does this have to do? A lot of things. You won, Steve. - Me what? - You won. She told me herself. She is waiting for you at the hotel. Do you think I'm going to marry her? I told you a while ago that if something started with Chris, it had better be serious. I never did anything to make her think I meant it. You are too careless with the truth. If we hadn't been partners for so long, Jim... We were. It seems that he wants to undo this partnership. I've done this. I supported a lot of what you did, Steve, but not this time. It's all right. It's fine with me. But you still owe me half what you earn from that pack. You will receive yes. I have something else for you. Something that should have given him as soon as we arrived in Abilene. Kansas, take the table. What's up, Steve? What happened? I knew Jim was angry, but I didn't expect it to be cashed on my face. Hi. Let's play billiards. $ 0.20 per ball. - I don't know how to play billiards. - That's nice. We will play for $ 0.40 a ball. Choose a cue. This could be your last chance to learn how to play. It is better to learn. Why don't you leave here for a long time. - I suppose you want my gun? - No, stay with her. Yes, you may be crazy enough to get it out during the game. Arrange the balls. It seems that you arranged things the way you wanted. Could you at least tell me what's going on. Tell him. - How much did the girl tell you? - About what? - You do not know anything? - Why don't we tell him? Yes, it is better to count. He's not going anywhere. Go ahead, Balckie. Tell him. Well, for a start, you and your partner. are finished in Abilene. You are wrong about one thing. I have no partner. - What do you call Jim Cardwell? - I call it many things. Our partnership has been dissolved. This is the receipt. So you wouldn't mind if he was killed? From now on, whatever happens to him is his problem. Yes, but what about the herd he just bought? Jim bought the pack. Do what you want with it. Hey, are you telling the truth? Of course. You had all this work for nothing. Mind giving me space to put that shot? Eight ball in the corner. Lie on the floor and put your hands on your head. Lie down or I'll make you lie down. Next time, don't talk so much. It takes more than a punch to the chin for me to let you attack Jim. - What happened? - I'll tell you later. Give this to the Ballard gunmen when they leave the billiard room. We will shoot when they approach. Here comes Steve. What does he want? Do not know. Hey, here comes Logan. You better go through the woods. Ballard's men are ahead. Shoot. - Is it serious, Jim? - Not. Good. Draw their fire while I turn around from behind. You better stay still, Slim. I will shoot to show that I am not dead. Get your horses. He hit him. I'll get the horses, Slim. - How do you feel, Slim? - I am fine. It made me regret what happened in the city. I didn't do it for you. I own half of that pack and Ballard was going to destroy it. Hey, a fire. They set fire. This should take care of the herd. Let's go to the city. $ 15.50. $ 15.75. $ 16. I must agree with Steve Logan. Him... Hello, Logan. You have a beautiful place here. This facilitates the sale. Sit down and write a check for 3,000 head of cattle for $ 18 each. The rest, stay out of it. Ballard just killed my pack. - This is ridiculous. - Start writing! - That man is crazy. - Sit down and write! It pays for our losses, but not because of what happened to our herd. You will be judged for that. Now, get out of here! Watch out, Ballard! Stop! Stop! Who started this? Logan. Ask the buyers. Ballard started when he sent my pack to fire. He's crazy. I have no interest in cattle. Neither his nor anyone else's. I only know that you did justice with your own hands, two men were shot and you go to jail. - Give me that gun. - And Ballard? If you can prove something, present it at the trial. We cannot let him be judged. He knows a lot. He will not be judged. Call Randall. You will never win, sheriff, until you learn to focus... in the letter you want. Now, I'm concentrating. Let me see. 8, huh? Sheriff! You have to get Steve out of town right now. A crowd is gathering in front of the saloon. Where's Jim? Aren't you satisfied with what you did with Steve? - Now you want to involve Jim? - Look, this is no time for discussion. They will break into the jail to catch Steve. Ballard got him arrested for the shooting. A crowd is forming in the Ballard hall and I don't know what they will do. - Didn't Jim come back? - Where are you from? He went out to catch a herd hours ago. Ballard destroyed the herd and... So it's you, huh? Ballard will want to speak to you. Hey, Jim. Jim Cardwell. - I told you I would bring the cattle, didn't I? - Is that our cattle? I bought it with the money they lent me. Wow. Wait until Steve knows that. Ballard burned our herd... Let's move them. Let's go. There is a crowd going after Steve in jail. - What does he do in jail? - There is no time to explain. You have to help him out before it's too late. I will not leave the cattle here to be disbanded by Ballard's men. - Steve is your partner. - He doesn't act like one. Besides, that cattle is the only thing left for us. Let's go. Keep moving. Wait a minute. Let's stop talking and start taking action. Mike is right. All this discussion about letting the law take its course, it won't get us anywhere. I am against this. - Me too. - Let's get him now. There was no murderer in this city until their arrival. If we don't stop these duels, Abilene will be the destination of all outlaws in the west. What are we waiting for? I say the same. Let's get him. Watch from here. Wait, men. This is the end of the line. Sheriff, we want the man who arrested you. Not as long as I am the law. - Logan is a murderer. - We need to have order in Abilene. I will shoot the first man who approaches. Come back and I'll forget about it. Okay, men. Let's go back. Protect that door and close the windows. I'll let you out to help us. But you're still under arrest. Here's your gun. Thank you, sheriff. This is a good shootout. I'm going there. No, it won't. The girl must arrive, with Jim Cardwell at any time. - But... - You will stay here. Release the horses from that cart. Take some ropes and tie it. That's right. - Hey, sheriff. - Yes? They will use the cart to bring the door down. They hit him! Stampede! Stampede! It's Cardwell. Get her out of here! - Why are you here? - You won't get rid of me. - Give me some bullets quickly. - I do not have any. Did you hear that, Chango? They ran out of ammunition. Come out with your hands up. It looks like the hunting season is over. Returning to Texas to create a new herd. Are you happy, Chris? That's what the doctor ordered for us. - What about Steve and Claire? - You don't have to worry about them. They will be as happy as we are. Do you know what the Chihuahua governor told me? - You talk too much. - I don't speak. Say yes, Chinito. But since Chris and Jim decided to get together, we better be friends, like it or not. Yes, let's make it up. But if you decide to split up, you better be careful. Place the cards face up on the table. Well... Okay. If that's what you want. Well, you didn't have to take me that seriously. Since you did that. Let's keep it this way. The cards on the table. Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesternKasa / GM DEZ2020
