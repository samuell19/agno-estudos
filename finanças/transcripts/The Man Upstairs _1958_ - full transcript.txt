Have a look at the meter in my room? -Can't it wait until the morning? -Well. -Are you? -i'm um,damn cold. I don't seem to be able to get the hang of the things, I, I, if you could come and look at it for me. -Well, wait a minute then (Clock Ticking) -[Miss Blair] Well, who is it? -Our next door neighbour, the nighthawk from number eight. -Oh, well what's the matter with him now? -At first, i thought he'd gassed himself. Amazing look about him. (Knocking) -I know i shouldn't have stayed here. For Pete's sake, don't let him come in, Nick. -He doesn't want to comein. -Tell him to go away. -He only wants me to look at his gas heater. -Tell him to go away. Go on, go do it. -Okay. I say old boy!. -Could you come and show me how? -Now look here, perhaps you like staying up all night, but i need all the sleep i can get. Don't you know what time it is? -What time? I don't want to know what time it is. -Let's forget about it, shall we? -Wait, wait. (Door Shuts) (Clock Ticking) (Air Whooshing) (Glass Breaking) (Alarm Clock Ringing) -[Darcie] Mommy? (Alarm Clock Ringing) (Knocking) (Clock Ticking) (Heavy Breathing) -Are you ill, Mr. Wilson? Do you need any assistance, Mr. Wilson? I think you should go back to your room. Yes, go back. -Never. Never. (Thud) -How dare you? How dare you attack me? (Knocking) (Knocking) It's all right, Miss Acres. This is Mr.Pollen from number six. Wilson, the person who was knocking, has gone up stairs again, but if i were you, i'd lock my door. I'm going to telephone the police. (Clock ticking) (Door bell ringing) (Door bell ringing) -Who is it? Who is that? -[Mr. Pollen] Mrs. Lawrence? -Who? I'm just coming. just a sec. Oh. Oh, oh dear. (Humming) (Humming) -Good evening, Mrs. Lawrence. -What do you mean by ringing my bell at this time of the night? -It's, well, it's that fellow Wilson, you know? Wilson in number eight. He's, well, he's been banging on doors, waking everybody up, well he's raving, look, he knocked me down. -And what am i supposed to do about it at this time of the night? Have him certified? -Well, well you see, we, we can't have him certified. -Yeah, exactly. -Mrs. Lawrence look, I think he's dangerous. Something should be done and he's been acting very strangely at nights for well over a week or so and i thought, well, i wondered if you uh, thought that we should call for the police. -Oh, go away. -But Mrs. Lawrence! (Toys clanking) -Kids. -What's all the rumpus about, Mr. Pollen? -Is your husband back yet, Mrs. Barnes? -No he's not, he's still at work. What are you doing down here? Have you hurt yourself? -It's that fellow, Wilson. That new fellow upstairs, he's raving, banging on Miss Acre's door. He attacked me, look, he broke my glasses. -That doesn't sound like Mr. Wilson. I wonder if we should get him a doctor. He might need help. -May i ask why you're worried about him? Noone seems to give a damn! I'm the one who's been assaulted. -Why ever did he do it? -I just tried to help him, that's what i did and this, this is the thanks i got. -Do you know the othernight when he was down here helping Johnnie with his homework, I said at the time he didn't seem at all well. -Well then, the sooner we have him taken away, the better. He's a positive menace, I'm going to phone the police. (Phone dialling) (Air whooshing) (Air whooshing) (knocking) -[Mrs. Barnes] Mr. Wilson? (Knocking) Are you alright, Mr. Wilson? -Who is it? -What is the matter with you? -What do you want? -I want you to stop being silly. Now leave go of the door and let me in. That's better. What's wrong with you? -i'm alright. -But you're cold. -Cold as a frog, icy as charity. -i'll go make you a cup of tea. -No, no, no, I'm fine. l'm alright, really, i am. -Well, what about Mr. Pollen? What'd you go and do to him? He sent for the police, you know? -The police? This has nothing to do with the police. -Well didn't you? -Didn't i what? Mrs. Barnes, what are you doing up here? -Well, i came to tell you that. -It's late, isn't it? -Please Mr. Wilson, you don't look well. Why don't you let me go? -i'm alright now, I'm, i'm sorry i didn't call in this morning as i promised, but i, i didn't sleep last night either, i just couldn't. -Well, what i came to tell you was. -Tell Johnnie i'll help him with his homework tomorrow, but warn him to be careful. -Please, Mrs. Wilson. -No, no, this is important, Mrs. Barnes. There's no room for mistakes. Johnnie must be trained to check his work, again, again. -Mr. Wilson, listen to me. -And again. -What's the matter, what happened? you must tell me. What'd you do to Mr. Pollen? He looked quite a sight when he came downstairs, he said you'd hit him. -Mr. Pollen? i haven't seen him. -i'll go and fetch you a doctor. -Doctor? I, I, I've seen a do, here, he gave me these. -Oh, why don't you take one now? The other night when you came down to sit in for us. -Give you a goodnight's rest, he said. They only last about 10 minutes and then the dream comes back, worse than before. Do you, do you know the kind of dream i mean? It, it's the kind of dream that's even more real when you're awake. -PIease Mr. Wilson, the police will be here any minute. Wouldn't you rather wait for them downstairs? -That's kind of you, Mrs. Barnes, very kind, but, i can deal with them myself. -Well, surely there's somebody who can help you. -Look i, i think it would be better if you left me alone. -What about this girl? -Leave me alone, i'll be alright. Tell them all to, tell them all to leave me alone. -Are you sure you wouldn't rather to come down? -Look, what are you trying to do with me? -i'm trying to keep you out of troUble, Mr. Wilson and you're gonna be in bad trouble if you go on like this. The police are coming, you know? -i can deal with them myself. Now, please leave me alone! (Door shuts) (Door squeaking) (Door shuts) -I heard that. They've called the police. Give me alight. -Just a sec. -What do you think they'll do? Police i mean, what do you think they'll do? -If they come in here, we might be able to sell them this one. -Will they take um, names and addresses? -and your telephone number, darling. -It may get in the papers. -Mummy doesn't read the News of the World, does she? I could do with some free publicity though. -Toss me alight, here. -Parents are an accident, you said darling. Slavery is having to catch the last bus home. -I don't know how you can stand this place anyway, really. -Oh, stop moaning. -i tell you, I'm not going to, I'm not going to give them my name. -If the police come, I will tackle them. Anyhow, if you'd let me help the fellow with his gas meter in the first place, in all probability he'd have gone straight to bed. No whe's stirred up the Anthill. Just as everything was going so well. You know very well, if i don't sleep, i can't work. -Don't be silly. Don't, leave me alone. Ow, ouch. -They'll hear you if you scream. -You don't care if they do hear me. -Oh, alright! -Well you don't! -Why don't you go back into bed? I'll make some coffee. -I'm getting out of here. I'm getting dressed and l'm getting out of here. -Mr. Pollen, can you come down for a moment? (Church bells ringing) It's um, it's cold isn't it? -Yes, quite chilly Mrs. Lawrence. The police should be here at any moment now. -Oh, you look a bit shaken Up. I think you could do it with a little drink. Oh, aren't you clever? You've mended your glasses. -Well i always have a second pair in reserve, you know? -i'm uh, I'm sorry lf i flew off the handle just now. Gave me a bit of a shock seeing you at the door. I um, i wasn't expecting you. Come and have a drink. -No thank you, no. -Oh,come on, we're all broad minded i hope. -Well, a cup of tea perhaps. -That's right, come on, come on. (Door shuts) -Very nice, Mrs. Lawrence. -Come on Mr. Pollen, in here. (Door shuts) A drop of Five Star, it's the only thing for this time in the morning. Any sound from up there? -No, no, no -Well, there we are. Good health. You know, he doesn't look like a spiv, does he? -i'm not sure, but i know. -Do you think he's a writer? You know, one of them angry young men you're always reading about? -Well, he's certainly very, very angry. The way he went for me for no reason at all, you'd think i insulted him. -Mind you, I've never been able to get a word out of him, but that Mrs. Barnes woman, oh, she seems very chummy, doesn't she? -Really, Mrs. Barnes, i hardly feel that we should discuss that. -Oh go on, you're a man of the world. -It's my fault. -i'll tidy it up for you. (Phone ringing) -It's the police. -Oh. -Well, i, i do hope that i haven't inconvenienced you?. -Oh, nevermind. It's about time something exciting happened around here, eh? (Knocking) -Well Uh, that is the police and i really must go. -Let Mrs. Barnes answer it. She gets ten bob a week off her rent to clean the stairs and answer that bell, let her earn it. -Good evening ma'am, we've come about this. Oh yes, it's about the chap upstairs. He didn't mean any harm. I think you ought to know he's ill. -We've already thought of that, ma'am. Are you the lady of the house? -No, Mrs. Lawrence is the landlady, but i, i always answer the door. -He's on the top floor, Sergeant. My name's Pollen, I telephoned the station. Nothing further hash appened so far. -But before you start. -That's on the uh, third floor. -Before you start, don't you think. -Please madam, if you'll excuse me a moment while i deal with this gentlemen. -Yes, it was i who telephoned the police. -If you will go in and sit down for a few minutes, madam, I'll see you later. -What was the name again? -[Mr. Pollen] Pollen, Henry Pollen. -[Sergeant] No,i mean the. -Oh Um, Wilson, John Wilson. -is that cut all right sir? -Oh yes, yes, i uh, I always keep a first aid box. I'm an advanced certificate man, fire service during the war. -Seems a long time ago, doesn't it? -Yes. of course i uh. -Now about this. -Well, I'm in the civil defence now. -Yes, Wilson, has he behaved like this before? -[Pollen] Uh, no, no, not violently, but i hear him every night, late, well very late, pacing about his room. -How long has he been here? -Um, oh a matter of three weeks, maybe four. Mrs.Lawrence would let you know exactly, she's the landlady. -Where's her room? -Um oh, she has the whole of the first floor. You see, she lives. -And on the second floor? -The second floor, yes. Well, there's myself and Miss um, oh dear, Miss Acres, very quiet little person. Wilson was banging on her door too. -[Sergeant] And who else on the third floor? -[Mr. Pollen] Uh, third floor, beside Wilson, Mr. Nicholas, an artist of sorts. Wilson was having a row with him too. -Come on Fred, let's go up to the top and work our way down. -[Mrs. Barnes] Just a minute. Mr. Wilson isn't one of these crooks, he's very sensitive. It's no good shouting at him. -I didn't shout at him. i spoke to him very quetly and look what happened to me. -Perhaps he's got a relative or a friend or somebody who could help him. -That's very kind of you madam, but in the meantime, I wish you would sit down and take it easy. Come on Fred, let's have a dekko. (Rattling) (Rattling) -Excuse me officers, perhaps i better go first. That's his room, number eight. -The artist? -No, no, Wilson. Well, i thought you'd like to speak to him first? -Just in case. Now this is the artist's room? -Yes. -I'm not here, i'm not here. (Knocking) -[Sergeant] May i have a word with you sir? -[Pollen] Mr. Nicholas? This is Pollen from number six. It's only the police. Good evening. -This gentleman here tells me that the fellow in number eight has been causing a bit of trouble. -Well, as a matter of fact he has. -Did he make any threats, offer any violence? -No, he just made a complete nuisance of himself, that's all. But, why not leave it till the morning? -Don't you realise that he attacked me? -We have to follow these calls through, you know? -Yes. -You'd better come downstairs with us. you know? Wilson is dangerous. -No thanks, I'm alright where i am. Call again sometime. -Well, what do you think of that? -Fred. -But not as soul in this building seems to care what happened, not a soul. There might've been a murder for all Nicholas seemed to care. Sergeant, aren't you going to interview Wilson? After all, he did strike me. -Please don't tell me my job, Mr. Pollen. -But surely some action should be taken. -We phoned the Borough Mental Welfare Officer. We're supposed to wait until he gets here. He's bringing an ambulance with him. -Mr. Pollen, where are you and where are the police? -Just coming, Mrs. Lawrence. -Shouldering. After all, Disenfranchisement. -Is she the landlady? -I don't think she actually owns the place, you know? She has a friend. -Mr. Pollen! (Loud Thud) -[Fred] Perhaps you can help me sir. A complaint has been made. I'd like to ask you a few questions. -I'm not available. -I won't keep you a minute. -[Mr. Wilson] i'm not available. I'm not available at all! -[Fred] I shan't keep you a minute sir. I know it's a nuisance, me coming along at this time of night. -[Mr. Wilson] I'm not available, i tell you! -Sergeant. -Shh. -[Fred] We all have our job to do. Isn't that right, sir? (Grunting) (Knocking) -Is he dead? -No, but he's been very badly hurt i think. (Door Shuts) Now look, you stay with him while i run down and see if that's the ambulance. -[Sanderson] no lady, I'm not a doctor. I'm the Mental Welfare Officer. -I think you'd better go straight up. -Mr. Sanderson, we need a stretcher. The Sergeant's been badly hurt! I'll have to call the inspector. -i'll get one. Get the stretcher out. The Sergeant's been hurt. Come on now! and bring it upstairs, quickly! (Air Whooshing) -[Stevens] Yes sir, if you could. Thank you sir. -i've tried to stop the bleeding. Of course, he's not properly bandaged for a fracture. -I'm not a doctor. -Sh, sh, shouldn't we send for a doctor? -The sooner we get him to a hospital,the better. Are they sending anybody else from the station? -Yes, i've rung the inspector. -What did he say? -He said he'd be here in a couple of minutes. He thinks a lot of the Sergeant. Careful with him. (Air Whooshing) -[Sanderson] What happened? Tell me. -When he sees what's happened, he's really going to blow his top. Won't take him long to sort out that bloke upstairs. -[Mrs. Barnes] Oh, well, it's about Mr. Wilson. You don't know him? Well, there's a card of yours here. Yes there is, there's a message on the back. (Car Engine Revving) -is the bastard still up there? -In his room on the top floor, he's locked himself in. -Well, what are you waiting for? Don't wait for me. Stevens, i don't want to waste any time. You know there's a telephone, get some more men around here. -Right sir. -Well, aren't you going with him? It's your ambulance. Lucky, you brought it along tonight. -i'll telephone the hospital and tell them what to expect, but i think i should stay here. -You can leave it to us, Sanderson. We know how to deal with this sort of thing. This, this thug up there has a major assault charge to answer. This isn't a mental case anymore. -I know it's a rotten thing about the Sergeant, but i think he should have waited for me to go up there. -The Sergeant is very experienced officer. He'd know the right thing to do. -Look, I'm sorry, but don't you think you want to know the facts first? -Now look Mr. Sanderson, I've got my job to do and you've got yours. I can see your point of view. You think this man's mental, but that's only your guess. Why take chances? We're wasting time. -Well, what's your idea then? -i'm going to get him out now. -But he may be armed. -I thought it was his interests you were protecting. -Look, it's pretty obvious to me, from what's been happening around here, that that man is mentally ill. -Mentally ill? We'll see. -Inspector. This is Mrs. Barnes. -Good evening. -I'll phone the hospital for you. -My husband will be home at any minute and he'll want to know what's going on. -Your husband is the owner of this house? -No, but we live here, we've got a right to know what's going to happen. -You'll be warned if there's any danger. -Well, it's that chap Upstairs i'm worried about. Are there going to be any more stretcher cases? -Not if i had my way madam. -Well, i was only trying to help. -I must say i agree with you, Inspector. -Do you mind sir, do you mind? -[Sanderson] With a very badly injured police Sergeant. Now, will you keep me and Inspector Thompson informed on what's going on? -You can help. I'd like to get everybody downstairs into your flat if you don't mind. -I don't mind. That chap upstairs needs a doctor. -[Sanderson] Thanks very much. Now Inspector, can i have a word with you? -You're not going up there Sanderson. -Your Sergeant did send for me you know. -Yes i know, but we're not taking any further risks. -There can't be any harm in my just trying. -No, no, I'm not even going to let you risk your neck. -Well at least let me talk to some of the people in the house. Mrs. Barnes for instance, she might be able to throw some light on this chap's background. -Come on Stevens, and you, let's start sorting this thing out. (Knocking) -Ah, you're going up to fetch him out?. -All in good time madam. Meanwhile, i'd be grateful if you'd go downstairs to Mrs. Barnes flat. You too sir. -Oh, must we? -Please. Have you got a telephone? -Yes. -Do you mind if we use it? -Oh, i suppose so. -Clark, got on to the fire service, tell them to send round full rescue here. Then get on to records. You've got a description, name "John Wilson". Find out if he's got a record and find out quick. -Right sir. -[Inspector] We'll soon know whether he is a sick man or just another thug. -That's Wilson's door, sir. -Is there any other way out? -No sir. -What's up there? -Well, it was the attic, but the door's been boarded up. -Wilson! Are you coming out? Let's get everyone downstairs and we'll deal with him later. (Knocking) -Answer it. They'll try to come in if you don't answer it. -[Inspector] Sorry to disturb you, but i must have a word with you. -Coming. -For Pete's sake, don't let him try and come in. -[Inspector] Inspector Thompson here, you'll have to come downstairs immediately. -Oh, thanks. I can do with this. I've been out on another job, you know? A big chap, got very rough. -So you're nothing to do with the police? -No, i work for the Borough. We get called out to this sort of case. You keep saying you think this man upstairs needs a doctor. -Why are you so interested? -Oh, I'm not, personally. It's my job. We're supposed to see that these fellows don't do any harm to themselves or to anybody else. -It's nothing to do with me either, it's just that i feel. -Responsible for him? -I don't know why i should. -You know, if you want to do any good for this fellow upstairs, I think you ought to tell me everything you know about him. -Well, i don't know very much really. This is the card that i found in in his room. (Rattling) (Phone Ringing) (Church Bells Ringing) -I think you should let me tell the inspector. -i'd rather you didn't. She's on her way here now. It'd be much better if she talked to you first. -Yes, but it puts me in a. (Knocking) -Excuseme Mrs. Barnes. -i'm sorry to break up your tete-a-tete, i didn't want to come down but that lnspector insisted. -Well, make yourselves at home. -Oh, thank you. Ah, Mr. Pollen told me about you. You're are a psychologist, aren't you? -No, i'm not a psychologist. -Well, if you were a man, you'd go up and get that horrible creature out. Well i must say. -This is Miss Blair. She was helping me with my work and she missed her last bus home and Um. -Helping you with your homework, hey? -Would you like a cup of tea? -Yes please. -Not for me, I'm going to have some on my five star. Who else would like a drop of ODV? -Now madam, if you'd just, just sit down here and relax, leave everything to me. -Oh, comeon, just a drop. What about you, Inspector? It gives you courage, you know? -Thank you madam, no!. Is everybody down here? -Yes, yes. -Yes, this is my little lot. All except number eight. -I'm sorry, but i'll have to ask you all to stay here in the meantime. (Phone Ringing) -Hello? Yes sir. For you sir, the Superintendent. -Yes sir? Yes sir, we're all ready to go. All the people in the house are downstairs. I've sent for the rescue gear in case we need it. Yes, yes they did. Mr. Sanderson. Well, there's no need to do that sir, everything's well in hand. I'll report back as', look, why don't you let me, right sir. Right, I'll do nothing until you arrive. Right. The 'Super', now we'll be here all night. Mr. Pollen, can i have the use of your room? -Certainly Inspector. -That's all right thanks, I can find my own way. -What did the 'Super' say? -Wait. -Well, why didn't you let me know? (Overlapping Shouting) -[Collins] Oh, get that searchlight up on the balcony. I want it shining across on the house opposite, alright? Now just a moment sir, if you don't mind standing back on the pavement please. -I'll do nothing of the kind. -Now look sir. -Sergeant, the Inspector wants to know what's going on. -Well, tell him everything's in hand. The searchlights here, the fire engines waiting around the corner like he said. Now, what do you want sir? -I've come to collect the rent. -Take him across and make sure that Stevens checks him. -Very good sir. -Now come on Soldier, back to barracks, comeon. -Now what do you want? Been on the tiles? -Oh, you kill me you do. Look, i want to get some kip. -Alright, go on. -Excuse me sir, do you live here? -Yes. -What do you know about the man up on the top room? Wilson, isn't it? You know, up there in the top room. -Oh, it's him, is it? -Well, if you hadn't called them round that Sergeant might never have got hurt. -Society has got to be protected against some kinds of people, Mrs. Barnes. -Some kinds of people, Mr. Pollen, have to be protected against society. -Who's protecting Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Barnes? -What do you mean? -You know. -No we don't, Mrs. Lawrence. Why don't you tell us? -Oh, they're always the last to notice, husbands. -Hold on, hold on, hold on. -All right George, don't take any notice of her. -I don't. But i wish somebody would tell me what's going on here. (Overlapping Speaking) -Right, thanks. -How is he? -He's on the operating table already. -Well, what did they say? -It's well as can be expected, touch him and go, yes? -There's no trace, sir. -You've been long enough. -Well, they kept me hanging on the end of the line. There's nobody at all called John Wilson, sir, except an old man of about 70. -Probably a false name. Did you give them the description? -That's what took all the time, sir. They couldn't trace anybody, but they're still trying. -Yes? -And there's a bloke here from the news, sir. -A Reporter? Well, what does he want? -Well, he says he's a friend of the 'Super', the Superintendent. He's going on about the early editions. -Tell him he'll have to wait. -Right sir. (Slapping) -There he is! (Air Whooshing) -Collins! -Sir? --Get the fir ebrigade to come around now. -Oh, very good sir. Shall i get them to put up the ladder? -No, don't. Wait til i tell you. -Oh MacLean, run around and tell the fire brigade. -Very good sir. -No, Up, up. Up. (Heavy Breathing) -Just because he's keeping quiet now, it doesn't mean. -I told you, earlier tonight he was trying to turn his gas on. -Very considerate of him, save a lot of bother. Don't make me cry. -You know it all, don't you? -[Inspector] I know my job. I warned the Constable out there, if there were the slightest smell of gas to report it right away. -I don't want to interfere with your job, but i wish you'd let me try and get on with mine. Your people sent for me, you know? -I don't understand you, going on and on like this after what happened to my Sergeant. -i only want to stop anybody else getting hurt. -Look, i'll get Wilson out my way. Don't you realise this is the second one of my men who's been put in a hospital this week? People are getting used to seeing the police pushed around and everybody weeps buckets over these rotten little thugs who's fathers went on the booze, who's mothers didn't love them. It's never their fault, oh no. Well, we can't go on letting them get away with it. -I have a feeling Mr. Thompson, that that little lecture was really for my benefit. Let's sit down and talk things over, shall we? Quietly. -Goodnight love. No more waking up now. No, i don't understand it. He always seem a decent enough sort of bloke to me. -Well, that's what happened. There's nothing else i can tell you. -and believe me, he hasn't missed a single detail. -i've put Darcie in with Johnnie. Why didn't you turn in? -No, no, i want to see what's going to happen to that poor fellow up there first. -He's a damn nuisance. -That's your considered opinion, is it? -Yes it is. He's cost me one day's work already. I can't work when i'm tired. -Wilson's not only a nuisance, he's a public nuisance. -Just because he hit you? -Is that fair, Mrs. Barnes? I simply did my duty. -And you reckon it was your duty to have him arrested? -I didn't say that. The police will decide what has to be done. -What makes you so keen on the police, Mr. Pollen? -[Mr. Pollen] I'm not keen on the police, Mr. Barnes, but i respect them. They have a thankless job to do. Look what happened to that poor Sergeant. -[Nicholas] And who's fault wast hat? If you hadn't brought him round here in all probability, he'd still be alright. -How dare you suggest it was my fault? -Mind your halo, dear. -Oh, so you've found your tongue, have you? That's the girl, don't you take any nonsense from him. -I know it's awkward for everybody but don't expect me to apologise for calling in the police. -[Mrs. Lawrence] That's right, Mr. Pollen, don't you apologise. Nobody bothers about me and you, so why should we care about them? I always thought the fellow Up there was a crook. Well, now he'll get what's coming to him, even if Mrs. Barnes likes to think otherwise. -He's the same as anybody else here, just a human being. -Who says i'm just a human being? -Wilson has no right to any special consideration. -We're all equal in the sight of the Lord. -Oh, let's cut out that Rigmaroles. It's Rigmaroles, that's what i tell ya, it's Rigmaroles. Tramping up and down my stairs on the taxpayer's money. If that Inspector can't come and have a drink with me. (Overlapping Shouting) -Don't you think you'll have to let Mr. Sanderson see what he can do? No point in going bull at a gate, is there? Particularly with the press around. -You think you can talk him out of it, eh Sanderson? -It's certainly worth a try, isn't it? -I'll put another man up there with you. -No, he'd only get in the way. -[Inspector] I'll still put him up there. Follow him up. -Somebody's going up to his room. (Baby Crying) Shhh! -Mr. Wilson. My name is Sanderson. Can you hear me? Won't you let me come in and talk? I may be able to help you. (Coughing) Can't you wait downstairs? -[Stevens] Sorry sir, Inspector's orders. -My name is Sanderson, I'm not a policeman. I've come here to try and help you. Please let me come in and have a talk. -[Mr. Wilson] Leave that door alone. -You uh, hit a police Sergeant. You hurt him pretty badly. Do you realise that? You see, the thing is that, that you're responsible. You'll have to do some explaining. Are you listening to me? Wilson, people in this house, friends of yours, they're worried about you. Won't you let me in? We haven't gotten much more time. -Get away from that door! Leave me alone! -You're not going to be left alone, it's gone too far now. You've got to come out here, you got to talk. Now, do you understand? It's gone too far. Look, there's nobody else on the landing, only a Constable on the stairs. Now if you open the door and let me in, you can lock it behind me, but do it now. They're not going to give me much more time. Thanks for letting me in. Cigarette? -No thanks. -Did you understand what i was telling you through the door? i am what's known as a Mental Welfare Officer. I'm not a doctor and i have nothing to do with the police, but i can get you help if you want it. -I don't. -Alright. Then why did you hit the police officer? -Because he tried to take me away. -And what about that other chap? Pollen, I think his name is, downstairs. -Did i hit him? -Looks like it. -i'm sorry about that. (Bell Ringing) Stay away from me! (Bell Ringing) -But you're all in, man! (Bell Ringing) -On the, the table, the uh, bottle. (Church Bell Ringing) Take them for headaches. I'm sorry. Excuse the exhibition. -It seems to me you need treatment pretty badly. Look Uh, i can get you to a hospital and it might be the best way for you to get out of this house. -I've been talked into things once too often. I'm safer where i am. -Well, is there nobody who would want you to come out of this room? Nobody who is concerned about you? -No. -Well, look at it this way, the police are not very happy about what you did to their Sergeant. I'm told he did fall, and i can believe that it was partly an accident. But if you stop resisting them now, playing about with that gun. I don't give much for your chances. (Knocking) -[Stevens] You alright, Mr. Sanderson? -Yes, i'm alright. Now leave us alone. -[Stevens] Well, the Superintendent wants to know. -[Mr. Sanderson] Well, tell him not to worry. -Why did they let you come up here? -Because i said i'd try and get you down quietly. -[Mr. Wilson] I'm not coming. It's no use, Mr. Sanderson. I'm not going back. They don't understand. -Who doesn't understand? -Look, I, I think perhaps you better go now, I, I might. -What are you scared of? I've spoken to Mrs. Barnes, you know? -Did you ever kill anyone? Well i have. -Well, why don't you tell me about it? -Well, it was in the lab that they said it was an accident, but it wasn't, it was my fault. I should've checked again. -Were you hurt? -Hurt? Well, my head, I, but it killed him. It killed her brother, I saw it happen. I know where it can lead. That's what i dream about. I'm not going to be responsible for. -Look, you're not doing yourself any good by shutting yourself in this room. Now, why didn't you come out? -Here it's only, I, I can even forget it sometimes but, out there i 'll have to live with it. I'm not coming out! l'm not available! put that thing out! Switch that bloody thing off! I am not available! (Gunshots) -Put that gun down! (Shouting) This'll do you no good with the police! -Get out! -What's happened? What's going on? -No, no, nobody's hurt. He wasn't shooting at me, he wasn't shooting at anyone. He just doesn't know what he's doing. -Alright, he's got a gun. It's going to be our way now. -If it hadn't been for your damned searchlight shining in to his eyes and your men knocking at the door at the wrong minute, i might have got somewhere with him. -Alright, take it easy. -i'd just about got him. Now, will you let me try again later on? -Come on down the stairs. We're going to do it our way. (Overlapping Shouting) -Come along, the Inspector will keep you informed. Nobody's been hurt. If you don't go sit down Miss, somebody is going to be hurt. Come along please, come along, inside there. -Is there a Mrs. Barnes in there? -Yes, that's me. -There was a young lady to see you. -Oh. -[Clark] Inside, thank you. Thank you, just sit down. -Mrs. Barnes, I'm Helen Grey. -I thought it was you from the photo. -is he alright? -so far. -That Sergeant he hurt. -Well, we don't know anymore really. Oh, this is the card that i found. -Yes, it's mine. Where did you find it? -Well, like i said in your friend's room. Do you know he's got a gun up there? Well, he did fire it off a few minutes ago, but they say nobody was hurt. -He couldn't mean, it was very thoughtful of you to call me, Mrs. Barnes. -Well, we got sort of friendly with him, you know? Not that we knew him very well, but he got talking to our Johnnie one day, down here on the stairs and he started helping him with his homework. He isn't well is he? -No. He was in an accident, a terrible accident. Mrs. Barnes, I must talk to him. I know what's wrong with him, I'm sure. -Mr.Sanderson's the man to see, he's the Welfare Officer. I told him you were coming. He's quite a nice man really, up the stairs here. -Of course there's no day staff. Just tell her whoever it is to keep going through the records until they find him. Now, has Sergeant Morris signed for that Webley? Good,tell him to get round here with it at once. -Another gun? -Please Mr. Sanderson, the Inspector's only taking sensible precautions. (Knocking) -Excuse me sir, it's Mrs. Barnes. -What does that blasted woman want this time? -Well, she's got a young lady with her. They want to talk to Mr. Sanderson. -Young lady? -[Inspector] Come in. What's your name, please? -Helen Grey. Are you Mr. Sanderson? -Are you a relation to Mr. Wilson? -We're going to be married. -Sanderson, did you call Mrs. Grey? -No, i telephoned her. -Very considerate of you Mrs. Barnes. Next time, perhaps you'll take us in to your confidence. -Ms. Grey wanted to talk to me. -Why didn't you tell us she was coming? -i asked him not to tell you. -Mrs. Barnes, is there anything else you haven't told us? Then perhaps you'll be kind enough to wait downstairs. -Come and sit over here, Miss Grey. Why is your friend Wilson hiding in his house? -Now look, Inspector, Mr. Grey asked to speak to me. -i don't think anything Mrs. Grey has to say need be confidential, Mr. Sanderson. -But Inspector Thompson shouldn't ask questions like that. He's making it look as if that man's on the run. -And isn't he? -No He doesn't know, he can't know what he's doing. -That's a matter of opinion, but he's not helping himself by locking himself in. -Where did he get that gun from? -I don't know. He, I think it was his father's, but he's never used it. -Wouldn't he? -Will you let me talk to him? -Talk to him? That woman downstairs has talked to him. Sanderson has talked to him and nearly got his brains blown out for his troubles. -That's not true. -PIease let me talk to him, Peter will listen to me. I understand what's happened, I. -Peter? I thought you said his name was John. Well? -i'm sure Mrs. Grey's only trying to help us. -And she can help us. Will you come with me, Mrs. Grey? -Here now, here now, wait a minute. -Miss Grey is willing to help us. -Now look here. -i'm sure the Inspector has very good reasons to believe that Mrs. Grey can help. I think it would be better if we left it to him. -What's his real name, Mrs. Grey? I know it isn't John Wilson. You're doing no good by keeping this information from us. -I want to talk to him. -It's no good, miss. Now come on, tell me his real name. -Let me try and talk to him. If that does no good, then I'll tell you his name. -I want his name. -If i, if i give you his name, will you let me talk to him? -Alright. -His name is Watson, Peter Watson. (Phone Ringing) -Stevens! if that's Morris in the car, tell him to come up and hurry! Don't worry Miss, i'll keep my word. -Have they got him out yet? -No, they've got his girlfriend in there now. -The Inspector wants you with the Webley. They're going up to his room. -Give me the gun, Rogers. There you are, you can take it. -No, i'd have to sign for it. -Blasted red tape. (Shouting) -They've got a gun! -Hurry up Morris! Upstairs. Come with me Miss and do what i tell you. -Excuse me, sir. We're having a bit of trouble with the Reporter, sir. They're talking about the early editions. -You can tell them that we're still doing our best to bring him out quietly, but there's something else I want you to do first. We've got the man's real name, it's Peter Watson. Watson, got it? -Right. -Get back on that phone to Records and don't waste any time. -Peter Watson, right sir. (Knocking) (Air Whooshing) -[Helen] Peter? Peter, it's me, Helen. I want to help you. Peter, listen to me. Let me go to him. -Stay where you are. -Let me just touch the door! Peter, you can't fight them. Please come out. Peter, listen to me, I love you! I understand now, i do. -Come on Miss, this is no good. -Peter! -Come on Miss. -Peter! (Table Rocking) (Air Whooshing) -I thought they wouldn't get anywhere with her. -Come on, come on. You go in there if you don't mind, right in there, please. Come on. Thank you. -[Mrs. Lawrence] You must need a drink, Mr. Barnes. Have one on the house. -Any news? -Any more broken windows, Mr. Pollen? -Oh,they've taken that girl down again, but he's still locked in. -And who do you think is going to pay for the damage? -[Mr. Pollen] Oh, the government will be entirely responsible for that, Mrs. Lawrence, entirely. -Ah. -I feel sorry for that girl. i bet they never gave her a chance. -Let's ring Mummy and ask her advice, shall we? -i shouldn't worry too much, love. They know what they're doing. -i know it's difficult for you to see, but after the accident, after my brother was killed, he was afraid to go back to his work. None of us understood and he's afraid, afraid of hi swork. That's all it is! -Not according to the Criminal Record Office, Mrs. Grey. After that accident, he attacked and injured a member of the Board of Inquiry. -But he's not a criminal, you know he's not. -He's a wanted man,that's all i know. There may be a murder charge soon. -Murder, but you don't know anything about him. -I'm sorry to have to cut this short Miss Grey. -Oh now wait one minute, Superintendent. -Mr. Sanderson, wear every grateful to you for your advice but we are not obliged to follow it. Now, would you be kind enough to wait outside for a few minutes with Miss Grey? I want to talk to the Inspector. -I told you he had a record sir. Can we get cracking now? -It's not as clearcut as all that. -I don't see any complications. -Well after all, he's a scientist and work of that nature these days can impose a great strain on a man and then there was this business of the brother getting killed. -And what about my Sergeant, sir? -Any news from the hospital? -He's still on the operating table. I can't get anything out of them. -Lot of Press people out there now. -Are we going to let them dictate to us? -Was he badly hurt? -He was in the hospital for sometime, head injuries, then there was the shock. He was never a very calm person, but after the accident he was worse. -Hm. But Um, why did he hit that chap at the Board of Inquiry? You did say that they cleared him from all blame. -He couldn't have forced Peter to go back to his work, but he accused him of being a coward and he lashed out. of course it was a terrible thing to do, but none of them Understood. I didn't either. Then he disappeared. -Well, i can understand a scientist being frightened of where his work might lead him these days, but he's sick, you know? Very sick. -Do you think he'll kill himself? -Perhaps he doesn't care whether he kills or gets killed. -There must be something you can do. -i'll try again. -What is it, Sanderson? -i'm sorry Superintendent but, i think you're making a mistake. -i'm not aware that you know what my instructions are. -We must try and get this chap to talk to us. -Are you questioning my authority in some way? -No, of course not, but this is a very unusual case. -What's unusual about it? What's all this mumbo jumbo? We put thugs away everyday. -You can't call this chap a thug. He had a responsible job, he's an educated man. -An educated man. The more brains they have, the trickier they can be. -Now look, let's try and keep some sense in this. I'm only trying to see that there'll be no more violence. -You hypocrite. What are you trying to do? Are you trying to protect us or that thug up there? Just because he doesn't look like a Teddyboy, because he's educated, because some girl. -[Superintendent] Inspector, I think you've made your point. We don't intend using violence on anybody, Mr. Sanderson. That is not likely to be necessary. I would be most grateful if you would take Miss Grey downstairs and see that she doesn't worry too much. (Church Bell Ringing) (Church Bell Ringing) (Church Bell Ringing) (Church Bell Ringing) -The policemen in the hall says they found out he has a record of violence, a dangerous man and his name isn't Wilson at all. -Don't shout at my wife. -I apologise Mr. Barnes, but i've been accused and by your wife in particular being a busybody, simply because i had the good sense to see the facts of this matter. -You have behaved, sir, like an officer and a gentleman throughout. -I was never in the army, Mr. Nicholas. Mr. Barnes, now that we know this man as a criminal, surely you must agree with what i've been saying. -He's an exhibitionist. It's all very well in it's place, but it's a damn nuisance here. Well, i don't know about the rest of you, but i'm going to give them five more minutes, if they haven't got him out by then, I'm going straight up to bed. -[Mrs. Lawrence] And what about your friend, dear? She missed the last bus, didn't she? You're going to have her sent home on the fire engine? -It's a very cold night, isn't it? I'm sure that poor man will be suffering up there if he can't use his gas fire. -Mum, i want to go. Did you hear the fire engines? -Catch your death of cold standing there. You should be asleep, no, not out there, come on. -Poor kid, he took a liking to that chap upstairs. (Knocking) Come in. -This is Miss Grey. -What's happening up there, Mr. Sanderson? -Oh, i'm afraid we weren't able to do any good. -And the police are doing nothing, i suppose. -[Mr.Sanderson] On the contrary. They intend to get him out of that room their way. -Is there nothing we can do? -I just don't know. -I've let him down again. -What did he say? -Nothing, he wouldn't answer. -Well what happened? -I tried to talk to him. I thought i was being clever, but they've got his name and that's all they wanted. -What is his name? -It doesn't matter, that's not the point. -Well what is the point? -Oh, what's the use? They won't listen now, it's too late. -No, don't give in like that. Give us a chance. Well, we're not like that lot upstairs, we'll listen. Tell us. -Couldn't you tell them? -it would be better coming from you. -But i don't know how to. -Miss Grey! You keep saying that you're to blame, that you want to help, well now's your chance. Do you want to help or don't you? -Yes, of course i do. -Well then, tell them the story yourself. It would help them to understand better. Go on. -Okay, you can go ahead. -Pitch to the centre window. I'll cover the centre window. (Engine Roaring) -Are you organised down here, Collins? -Oh yes sir, i think so. The ladder's nearly ready. Shall i send a man up now? -Not yet. The Super's been on to Woolwich, but we're going to soften him up with a bit of tear gas. It won't be long now. (Engine Roaring) (Machine Whirring) (Machine Whirring) (Machine Whirring) -[Mr. Pollen] Hasn't he any sense of responsibility? -Yes, of course he has, but he's afraid of what can happen and who are we to say he isn't right? -All these scientists think they're a law unto themselves. -Hm, sounds like a dangerous lunatic to me. -He acted a bit silly, i grant you, but things have gone against him. Anyway, he stuck up for what he thought was right. -He's afraid to take his medicine. -At least he doesn't take your kind of medicine. -Well, I've had my trouble, i don't mind admitting it, but whoever worried about me? Who cares, eh? Who cares? -Well, if we all refused to accept the advice of our superiors, it would be anarchy. -I'm beginning to sympathise with that fellow up there. -That's a fat lot of use to him now. -Of course i've, i've had my disappointments, but i've, i've never assaulted my superiors if they happened to disagree with me. -If you hadn't spent your life never speaking out of turn perhaps you wouldn't still be a black coated, sandwiches for lunch, 0:00 to 5:30 clerk. -And you're a very impertinent young man. -And what about you Mr. Barnes? You got turned down for that Station Inspector's job for speaking out of turn, didn't you? -Mr.Barnes has the courage of his convictions and good luck to him and good luck to that bloke up there too. -Don't lump me in with him, I'm not asking for sympathy. -[Mrs. Barnes] Well, he's not asking for any sympathy either, is he? -Mrs. Barnes is right. All you're doing is sitting around here talking about yourselves. -[Mr. Pollen] I hardly think Miss, that you're in a position to tell us what's right. -Mom,the soldiers are here in a jeep. -Johnnie, you should have been in bed an hour ago. Now you lie down and go to sleep, there's a good boy. -But what's happening? Why is everybody here? Is there a fire or something? -No! Just you lie down and go to sleep. -But Mum. -Oh, I'll get your father into you. Now don't you let me catch you out of bed again. There you are, you've woken Darcie. -Well, how long's your blasted lorry going to be? -The vehicle had to come from Stores sir, should be here any moment. -Why you couldn't bring the tear gas in this jeep. -This'll be better sir, it's shorter you see. You don't need so much room to use if the passage is narrow. -Right, MacLean, send this up to Stevens. -Do you want fire fighting equipment sir? -He wouldn't have the guts to start a fire, they never do. We'll send the tear gas in from the ladder. -The tear gas has arrived sir. (Engine Running) -[Mr. Sanderson] Mrs. Barnes. They're bringing in tear gas. -Oh, this is it. -I'll do what i can of course, but it's going to be up to you as much as me. -What are you going to do? -No wait, i was listening to you in there. That girl Blair for instance, she's coming around already. if we can only get the others to come too. -Oh, they don't care what happens to him. -No, you're wrong. I was watching them. You can do it. -Yes, but what would be the use now? -Because if we can get them to think as you do, then we can goto the Superintendent. I know him, he'd have to pay attention. Look, I'm going to try and stall them. Please do what you can. -[Darcie] i want to get up, Mummy, I want to get up. -Look at that. Firemen and Soldiers, Civil Defence, Police. They'll be calling out the Air Force next. I don't suppose you meant any harm, Mr. Pollen, but i reckon you're the sort of bloke who starts wars, you know? -Perhaps you believe in appeasement, Mrs. Barnes? -Surely we all believe in peace. -Look, i know it's nothing to do with me, but i know how you feel. I'm sorry. -Don't be sorry for me. I was the one who could've helped him. -[Miss Blair] Well if there's anything i can do, anything at all. -Climb up the fireman's ladder i suppose? Let's face it, there's nothing we can do. -Yes there is, there is something we can do. I've just been talking to Mr. Sanderson. -Now, you've got no business. -Listen, please. Well there isn't much time. You can see what's going on out there. -I'm very sorry sir, I didn't realise they'd sent this type. -We could still throw it through the window. -There are really used for testing gas masks sir, you just unscrew the top. The trouble is, i'm not certain that this is the right kind of tear gas. -Well, there must be something we can use. -Oh yes sir, you want the American type Federal Anti-Riot gun. -Then get Woolwich to send us one. -Well, we use them overseas, but i don't think they're allowed in this country sir. -Listen,this is an emergency. -Wouldn't any type of tear gas be dangerous? -Oh no sir, it's absolutely harmless, that's the whole point. It only makes you cry, just the job to get this chap to come out. It states in the manual, it creates an absolutely ungovernable desire for fresh air. -Can't you see that it would make him chuck himself out of the window? -There's nothing you can do Sanderson, you may as well go home. Please get onto Woolwich right away. -I'm sorry sir, i'd like to see the Superintendent first. -Why have you got to see the Superintendent? -I'd like the authority, sir. -Alright, upstairs. -I'm terribly sorry about this sir, it's completely out of my hands. -Oh, Mr. Sanderson. -Look, if the police go in there, I'm pretty sure he'll jump from the window. Won't you get some blankets ready? -We don't have jumping sheets. The brigade hasn't used them for years. We usually block the window with the ladder. In this case, there are three windows. -Well, what if he jumps? -i don't think that's very likely, Mr. Sanderson. Anyway, i'll have one of my men at the window. -Yes, but what about those other windows, those two on the sides? (Air Whooshing) (Air Whooshing) (Thud) -[Mr. Pollen] You won't change my views. I think we should backup the police in whatever they decide to do. -[Mr. Lawrence] Oh,let them get on with it it. What do you want us to do? Tell the police to go home and then pass the hat round to collect Mr. Blooming What's his name's rent for him? -Of course i, i'm prepared to believe that he meant me no harm. After all i, I did startle him, but his attack on that Police Sergeant was brutal and deliberate. -Brutal and deliberate, how do you know? -Well, we can only judge on results. -But it was an accident. You know it was an accident. -An accident. Now you told us that he hit that gentleman at the Board of Inquiry. He hit me and he hit the Police Sergeant. All accidents? Oh no, Miss Grey. Now, it's pertectly understandable that you just see one side of the problem.. The police have the worst job in the world. (Phone Ringing) Don't you agree, Mr. Barnes? -I'm not taking sides for or against the police. -If that Police Sergeant hadn't gone blundering in, if he'd waited for Mr. Sanderson, nobody would have got hurt. Well, does everything have to be settled by proving who's the strongest? -Well, don't shout at me. -I'm not shouting. -I can't help what's happened. -We know Mr. Wilson. He's looked after the kids for us and he's been civil. He's nothing to me, I'm not even sorry for him. It just happens thats ometimes you get put in a position where you can give somebody a hand. You either give them a hand or you cross to the other side of the road, that's all. -I wish we could get this thing settled. -Can't we draw the curtains and put that blasted light on? -You can't shut it out as easy as that. We're all in it. We should have helped him in the first place but no, we shut the door on him. -We? Who told me not to help him? Who said, "Tell him to go away?" -I think they ought to leave him alone. If they leave him alone, he'll probably be sorry for the trouble he's caused and give himself up in the morning. -Oh no Miss Acres, that's, that's impossible. -Oh, i didn't exactly mean that Mr. Pollen. I was only thinking how we could help. -There's only one way we can help and we've got to be quick about it. We've got to go up there and stop the police from doing this. -What, you and Miss Acres? -No, all of us together. -We can't interfere with the police, Mrs. Barnes, they have their duty to do. (Ladder Creaking) (Air Whooshing) (Church Bell Ringing) -I see. Yes sir. I'll tell the Superintendent. Thank you. -Well what did they say about this Federal Anti-Riot gun? -It's supplied by a firm in the city, sir, but as i told you, for overseas use only. I'm terribly sorry. -Oh, don't apologise Lieutenant. We shouldn't have called on the Army in the first place. -Look, if this thing's been designed for the job, I think we ought to have it. -Well that's not it sir. I shouldn't really be here at all actually. They gave me a bit of a rocket, I'm afraid. Apparently, you should have got onto the War Office. -Well let's use these canisters. We could bore holes in the door and screw them in. -Well i don't know sir. You see, i'm not really an expert. -My men are getting pretty restless, sir. -[Superintendent] All in good time, Thompson. I'm not going to stand in your way. -Look, if you start breaking that door down now, he's going to go straight out of one of the windows, I know he will. -That's all been taken care off, the fire brigade's out there. -Yes, and i've been talking to them. You can't expect them to be responsible. You're going to have a suicide on your hands. I'm going to get the medical officer over here. -Bit late isn't it? You should have thought of that before. -This is a police case. Until we get that man out, this has nothing to do with anybody else. -it has to do with all of us! Have you no conscience about all this? -My conscience is pertectly clear. -Well i hope it's still clear in the morning, after you've read the newspapers. -What do you mean? -I was just wondering what their attitude would be to all this? -Ah, so Mr. Sanderson's going to run around telling tales out of school. Perhaps he thinks the newspapers will be interested in his sloppy theories? -I'm sure that's not in Mr. Sanderson's mind. But i'm not sure what is? -I was just wondering what they might pickup from the people living in this house. -The people in this house aren't interested. They brought us in to protect them and they'll leave us to it. -I wouldn't be too sure of that. -i'll take a bet, Mr. Sanderson, that you're wrong, very wrong. There's only one thing the people in this house would say. -Well whether he's sane or insane, he must be taken out of here and only the police can do that. Now, you've tried Mrs. Barnes, Miss Grey tried and Mr. Sanderson tried. -True, true, but um, why don't you try? After all, your experience in the Civil Defence might make all the difference. -Even you could help, Mr. Nicholas. If you'd leave off being sarcastic and just act natural. As for you, Mr. Pollen, with all your talk about duty and so forth, you ought to be the one to back me up. -It's all very difficult, but i don't think that we should try to take on all this responsibility. -[Mr. Barnes] Well i like that. Who took on the responsibility of calling the police? -i'm getting infernally tired of being blamed for that. -I'm not going to wait any longer, I'm going up there myself. -[Mr. Barnes] You're not going up their alone. -Well you come with me. (Phone Ringing) -Well, the police wouldn't let you get up there anyway. -Even if you don't care about Mr. Wilson, think about Darcie and Johnnie. Well, you can see what'll happen if the police get him down their way. At least we may be able to get him down quietly. -Yes, perhaps you're right. We could give it a go. What do you blokes say? -Well, wouldn't it be wiser if we didn't get mixed up with what's going on up there? I think we'd be taking too much on ourselves. After all, we don't really know this man do we now? -That's right, we don't know him and we don't want to know him. -How right, how absolutely right. Let's shoot all the people we don't know. The Uh, firing squads can be issued with smoked glasses, guided missiles at ten million paces. That's it, eh Mr. Pollen? push the button high enough up or far enough away and you don't even hear the bang. Rest in peace, out of sight, out of mind. Call the police, let them get on with it. -Don't attack me, Mr. Nicholas. I tried to do what i thought was right. -Oh, how you can put up with this lot, i don't know. Come in the backroom, Mr. Pollen. What you need's a drop of Brandy. -Thank you Mrs. Lawrence, but i do feel that i should finally explain to everybody my point of view. -Alright, alright, have it your own way. I know when i'm not wanted. This is my house, but i'm the last one to be consulted. Nobody takes any notice of me. Well i don't care what you do, any of you. -Mrs.Barnes kindly offered to talk to the police, perhaps she could see them on our behalf and tell them how we feel. -We can't get out of it like that, not even you Miss Acres. -If you all come up with me, if we all go up together, even if we only go up and stand there. -I see what you mean. If we all go up together, the police can't really do anything, can they? -Well what about you, Mr. Nicholas? -Well, after what i said to Mr. Pollen, I can't very well refuse can i? -What about you, Mr. Pollen? -Well, we must all make allowances for one another, but are you acting wisely? -Miss Blair? -Yes. -i'm coming with you. -Good. -And i agree. -[Mr. Pollen] Now wait a moment now. -Are you coming with us or not? -Standby! We're going up to get him! -Well, i do hope you're doing the right thing. Well,under the circumstances, of course it was i who sent for the police. Yes, yes, I, i think I'd better be with you. -[Inspector] Watson! Peter Alexander Watson! I have a warrant! (Glass Breaking) (Shouting) You've got one minute to open that door. Throw that gun out first and then come out yourself when i tell you. Throw thatt hing out and nobody will get hurt. Hurry up Watson, you've got another 45 seconds. You've got another 30 seconds. -[Mrs. Barnes] Wait, tell them to wait. -Who the blazes let anybody up here? Where's the 'Super'? -What is the meaning of this demonstration? -And he wanted to know what the people in this house would think. -We want to know that that man up there is gonna be given a chance to come down quietly. We think the Welfare Officer should talk to him again, that's our opinion. -Don't interfere, Mrs. Barnes. Nobody's going to get hurt if we can avoid it. -Well, nobody will get hurt if Mr. Sanderson gets him to come down quietly. -Will you allow me to decide what's to be done? You are not going up there again. -Well then let me try. -Why you? -[Mrs. Barnes] He might listen to me. I think he might listen to me. He's got nothing to fear from me. He let me talk to him earlier tonight and i know better what to say to him this time. -Can i have permission to carry on, sir? -It's worth letting her try, sir. -Alright, I'm taking a risk i should never take, but if nothing else will reassure you. -What are you trying to do, sir? -Don't stop me. -Will you take this lady upstairs. She has three minutes, that's all. After that, carry on as before. Now, all you others downstairs. -Morris, stay by me and keep that door covered. Stevens, over there. Mrs. Barnes, stand over there by the wall, just clear of the door and don't move. -Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Can you hear me, Mr. Wilson? It's me, Mrs. Barnes. Mr. Wilson, I'll call you that because that's how we all knowy ou, I thought you might listen to me. They've let me come up here. We want you to come out. We've all been talking about you, it's none of our business you might say, well it is in away, really. I wouldn't make a fuss about nothing. Take a chance and come out. Mr. Wilson listen, you know what you were saying about Johnnie's work? Well, he's woken up and Darcie and they'll be ever so Upset if anything happens. Johnnie knows it's you and they'll be so scared. Mr. Wilson, your Helen is waiting, if you'd only take the chance. We know what's made you feel so bad. Mr. Wilson, you've got to take the chance now. We want you to open the door. (Train Whistling) -[Inspector] Times up, Mrs. Barnes. (Door Unlocks) (Phone Ringing) -Well Inspector, the risk we took worked. I'll get in touch with the Yard. -Alright Mrs. Barnes. -The hospital's just been through sir, the Sergeant will be okay. -Good. -Will Mr. Wilson be alright now, Mum? -Yes, he'll be alright. -Mummy, Mummy.
