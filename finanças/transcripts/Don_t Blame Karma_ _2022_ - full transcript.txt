My curse didn't start in a mystic Egyptian tomb... ...or in a Mayan temple. It started at a children's party. And as usual, it all started with Lucy, my sister. All she had to do was smile, and she could get anything. Here's Lucy's cake! So to balance what genetics had simply denied me, I came up with a cunning and slightly evil plan. Make a wish, Lucy. - No, Sara, don't... Hey! - No! No! I just stole your wish. That's fine. Then I'm gonna steal all your wishes, but forever! Ugh! - Hey, hey! - Sara, no... And since that fateful day... ...everything changed. Everything! - Morning, Lucy. - Hi, Sara! - Is that her sister? - I think so. Ugh! It was so annoying, I begged my parents to change schools. Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye, bad karma. Hello, Aarón! Everything was perfect. By the way, I have a surprise for you. Really? - Okay. - You actually made this? - I did. - Sara... Finally, Lucy's curse had ended. Sara, you're... Love was knocking at my door. You are... - you're my best friend. - Or not. I guess my terrible bad luck wasn't going away. ♪ You gotta go balls to the wall! ♪ ♪ Balls! ♪ ♪ Balls! ♪ ♪ You gotta go balls to the wall! ♪ ♪ Balls! ♪ ♪ Balls! ♪ ♪ You gotta go balls to the wall! ♪ - Uh... answer it. It may be... - My sister. His family moved to Monterrey, and I never saw him again. Aarón. My first great love. ♪ I'm gonna chew you up, girl ♪ He got his first hit and beat all sales records. He became super famous and traveled around the world. ♪ You're my bubblegum ♪ - Sara? - Hello? Hey, sis! And Lucy also became, like, super famous. Her beauty conquered all the catwalks, and now she's the favorite model of many high-end brands. Mm-hmm, they're both super famous, and me... Well, here I am, in Mérida. With a really wonderful store that makes about... Seven hundred bucks. Which is enough to buy more t-shirts and print more bombas. Here. - This is a bomba. - A bomb? No. It's not a bomb bomb that goes... - What about your clothing brand? - Oh, Sacni. That's just a fantasy. You gave up on your pact, Sarita. I didn't give up on anything, Sacni. Of course not. I'm just living a stable life... - Hmm! - ...very peaceful... - In a house in ruins. - ...to purge my bad karma. That's fine. Then I'm gonna steal all your wishes, but forever! Ugh! Sara. Sara? Open the door. It's Lucy! Sara! Sis! Ugh! Where is she? My sister, Miss perfect. Always interrupting. Found it. It's an aquamarine from the Himalayas. It's for good luck, sis. Hmm. The one you shamelessly stole from me. Hmm? How nice, Lucy. Thanks. Sari, we have to catch up. I want to know it all. How are you and Gilberto? How's the boutique? Roberto. - Hello! - I'm on it. Hello, baby girl! Mommy and daddy are here! Hey! This is gorgeous, Mom. - And it's great for the heat here. - My God! It's incredible. Oh my God, Sarita. Your grandma's house looks like a dump, sweetie. Everything is falling apart. You said you would remodel it. Mom, I thought you were splitting up? I'm getting married! I'm engaged! - Getting married? - You? - Are you really splitting up? - No. Your mom has a lover and wants an open relationship. - What do you mean open? - I do not have a lover yet. - It's the possibility of having a lover. - What? They hooked up online. Just imagine how many STDs this guy has. Honey, tell me, are you pregnant? What? No. Mom, I'm in love. They're meeting here in Mérida, and he'll be wearing a green shirt. - Okay, why... - Stop! Lucia, who's your fiancé? A man or a woman, huh? - Don't change the subject. - Why don't you mull over the possibility of Sara getting married first? Oh my God! Enough! How about I take you to your rooms now, and tomorrow, we can talk about this? - Fine. - Come on. I don't want a divorce. Sari, thanks for giving me your bedroom. Between the news of our parents and this jet lag, I really need to rest. Do you want extra sheets? No way, I don't need sheets. I'm gonna sleep naked. This heat is absolutely foul. Oh my God, sis, I'm getting married! So cool. Hey, Dad. What are you doing in here? It's just that she doesn't want me sleeping with her. Are you serious? - Hmm. - Is it true, Mom? You actually kicked Dad out of the room? That's so low. I did it because your dad can't cut the discussion. He's being insufferable because I want an open relationship. Please, Mom, just get this thing over and done with. - Your daughter's getting married. - Yes. - That's more important. - I know. With her beauty and charisma, it took her long enough! - But of course others take longer, right? - Oh my God! Goodnight, Mom. I love you. Goodnight, sweetie. Thank you. What... - Can you hear me? - Tell her I'm happy for her. So what... Huh? Jeez, it's delayed. But can you hear me, my love? Yeah, perfectly. I was telling you that... That... That... That... ...your parents. My parents? Uh-huh. I... Something like obviously, because of her charisma and beauty, she was taking too long, blah, blah... Lame, right? Well, I guess that... I guess that... Hurry up, Dad! He'll be here soon. Hello. You must be Lucy's sister. I'm her fiancé. - Mmm. - How are you? - Aarón? - Sara? Sara! Is it you or just a resemblance? Seriously? Sarita. - Sara! - I can't believe it. What? Are you really... For real, are you actually... - You honestly are... - My handsome fiancé! - Oh, baby! - My precious. - Baby! I'm so glad you're here! - How are you? - You are so beautiful. - Oh! The curse is true. She's keeping all my wishes. Listen, this moment is absolutely special for me, guys. You truly have no idea... Ugh. Sari? Thanks. Sari, Aarón. - Aarón, Sari. - You won't believe this. I need you to become the best of friends. We've already been best friends in school! - What? - Sari, sarsaparilla! - What? You know each other? - My dear Sari. - You're kidding me, right? - Good morning! - General. - For real? - You remember me? - Morning. Wasn't he your best friend... - High school! Best pals! - ...in junior high? - That's right. - Wasn't he that little shit... But I turned into the shit. You are staying for breakfast, right? That's what I came for. Why don't you go get dressed and fix your beautiful hair nicely? Okay? What are we drinking, Mom? I'm making a mimosa. - Sari, sarsaparilla! - Cheers, Mom. Sarsaparilla! Sara, aren't you eating with us? Sara! - I'm okay! - You okay? That's what you get for not keeping up with the house. - You scared me. - Where will you sleep? - Me? - With me. Who else? In my room? Give me a sec, okay? It won't take long. I'm sorry. - Fucking shit. - You swear you're not hurt? - Are you all right? - Hang this here... I'm fine. Just fine. It's nothing. Why are you so nervous? Is there anything I can do? Of course I'm not nervous. Why would I be nervous? It's the caffeine. This is how I get... Hey, Sara, Sara! Just breathe, sis. Please stop. Look. I know that being bullied in school hurt you, sis. Okay? But... Was it Aarón? - It was him. That's why you're like this. - No. - I'm sure that's why... - Lucy, please. Turn it down a notch. Just calm down, okay? Because you are both welcome to stay. Your house is my house... I mean, my house is your house. Life's peachy. Cool. Bye. Um, but... You know what? Just a tiny favor. Don't act like you know me, Lucy, because you don't me at all. Pfft! Listen, Sacni. How fast do you think... How fast can we set up a clearance sale? Can I eat my breakfast? No. I just think I have to leave town soon. - Why? - Due to force majeure. On second thought, I think I need to leave the country. - The planet. - What's wrong with you? - Tsk. Why are you down there, Sara? - Oh, wait. I'll call you back. So, this was your grandma's house, and now it's your business? Yeah. Um, a very successful business. Uh, how about you? I heard somewhere that you're a... - a model or something? - A model? No. A singer. - Solo artist. - Right, a singer. Of course. That's right. Well, I became a businesswoman. "As I wandered by a graveyard I heard death yelling at me, 'If you won't let me have it, then at least let me see.'" Bomba! Frankly, they practically sell themselves. Hmm? I always knew you'd design something avant-garde. Right. Because you're now Mr. Famous and Amazing. Not as much as you. Look, your fans are waiting for you outside. The store's closed! Later, please. - Do you need to open? - Hello? No. No. - Is that okay? - Yes. Uh, Aarón. Aarón who? - Star? - Aarón Star. It's written on me. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm... Well, I'll leave you to... - to attend your legion of fans. - Thanks, brother-in-law. Open up your store as you usually do. And... - Well, let's catch up later. - Will do, bro. Bye. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Yoo-hoo, ma'am. Is anyone there? Is it open? Check it out, Sarita! Look! Yucatán Fashion Fest. So, are we going or what? No. You know I'm completely done with all the fashion stuff. Sarita, you haven't even tried yet. It's unbelievable, Sarita, honey, that you're convinced you have bad karma and that Lucy is to blame. But why? She's a witch, right? No way! Even worse. She's a model. Here you are. Thank you. Salud. You know that when I drink I lose complete control. So, no. Go ahead, lose it. That's exactly what you need, huh? - To have dreams again! - Oh my gosh. Some other day. I swear. We'll have drinks soon, okay? Right now, I'm only interested in being alone. Alone, okay? Creatures of light, you have no idea of how thrilled I am that you'll finally be able to meet my family. Who's she talking to? - Let me introduce you... - To her fans. - What? - ...to the hottest mom in the world. - Hello, everyone! - That looks yummy. And there's my dad. Say hi, Papi. You look so handsome with those sunglasses! And here I want you to meet Sari, my older sister. I have to tell you that she's not only the best designer in the world, she's my best friend forever. Since we were little, we've looked like identical twins. She's pretty, right? - They look like me. - Of course. - Yes! - I love your work, ma'am. They say I'm ugly. - Show some respect. - Stop nagging. Look at the camera. OMG, the time... The time has come. I'm very nervous, but... Okay, I wanna finally share with you the reason I have decided to gather today with my family, and you, my followers, of course, in Mérida, my grandmother's hometown. May she rest in peace. - My dear mother-in-law. - I miss her a lot. - Baby, should I say it or you? - You, you, you. - Are you sure? - You do it. Please. It's just that... I can hardly breathe. But, okay, anyway. Oh my God. My baby and I are... are getting married! When is the wedding? Let's get out of here before the crowd gets crazier. Oh my God. Please don't do that. Aarón Star! Why are you hiding here too? - Aarón! - Has someone told you that Aarón Star is officially the worst artist name in the universe? My manager picked it. I had nothing to do with it. Who is your manager? Your mother? I mean, really, dude. Who even are they? I think some reggaeton band. I like Punk Flamingos better. Yeah, well, me too. Thank you! We're the Punk Flamingos! This is all thanks to you. Okay. Let's get you out. - Yes, please. - Let's go that way. - Okay? - Yeah. You go that way. Oh! I said that way. Why don't you listen? Cover your face, dummy. You really know how to make Aarón laugh. - Me? - Yes. I saw you running together at the restaurant and... Tell me, what makes him laugh? I'm sure you know what makes him laugh. He's your fiancé, right? Well, it's just that... I met him... Less than a month ago. What? Actually, we've been in a relationship for months, okay? But he was in Spain, and I was in Nepal. You know, face-to-face, we've been together for three weeks... and two days. Oh my God. It's up to you to end this charade. If you don't want to help your sister, help yourself, pelaná. And for Aarón Star. That's called envy, Sacni. Disloyalty. And that's not me. I don't want to burn in freaking hell. Are you a Christian now? If the priest were to find out what you do on your virtual dates with Roberto. Say my name! - Can you see how wet I am? - Yes! Come on, baby, say my name! - "Do you want me wet, baby boy?" - Shut up, Sacni! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. What' the hell? How do you know about that? And besides, you said it yourself. I have a boyfriend. But when was the last time you saw him in person? Listen, Sarita. I know that you love Roberto, but there's nothing more fake than virtual love. Oh, I love this one. Mm-hmm. - It was amazing. - This is my special dish. Try it. You'll love it. - What is it? - A dip. No, wait, wait, wait! Are you still allergic to shrimp? - Mm-hmm. Yes. It is real shrimp? - What? Really? Careful, you'll kill him before the wedding. Baby, I didn't know you're allergic. - Haven't you seen my shrimp? - Hey! So crass. - The one I've got tattooed. - Babe, my parents. - Stop that. Wait. - It reminds me that I'm allergic. This one? It's just like the ones Sara use to draw for her decorations when she was little. Sara drew on me every day in school. - For real? - With a pen. Remember, they were always hanging out? They used to roll around in the cloth... - Mom, stop. - What do you mean roll around in cloth? - That's weird. - You were too little. - We only laid down on the cloth. - Sara, oh my God! - It's your hand. - Yeah. No, no, no. Wait a sec. Seriously, sis. This is a masterpiece. - You were a genius. - What was this technique called? Cyanotype. They develop in sunlight. I'm amazed you kept all of this since high school. I've got an idea. - This is amazing. - Oh no. Please, don't start. - No, no. I have got a super idea. - All right, enough. Amore mio! - Oh! - Come to my arms, pretty please. - I can't believe my eyes. - Come to me. Come to me. Come to me. - Ah! - Yes! Sari, let me introduce you to Colavita. Arturo Colavita? - Mm-hmm. - Uh-huh. But he's super famous. Wow, it is such an honor! - Pleased to meet you. - I don't touch people, honey. Oh! Get a couple for our guests. Please sit down. Go ahead. Baby, tell me everything. Do you have a collection for Fashion Fest? Uh, I did. But then I paid a visit to that bitch Marina Abramóvich, in Sarajevo... - Oh, wow. - Mm-hmm. And she made me doubt myself. I don't know. She stole my inspiration. - Did she really? - You. Inspire me. She did. I understand perfectly. I'm familiar with that feeling. Well, then brace yourself, because I'm about to introduce you to the person that will save your life. - No, forget it. It's all done. - Lucy! I'm not showing just any shawl. - Ta-da! - Lucy! Look at this. Local design? No, no, no. Zenotype. Yeah? No. Cyanotype. Cyanotypes. Whatever. They develop with sunlight. - Can you... can you stand it? - Wow! They've got something. But we need finer fabrics. - Because this is a piece of rag. - Hey, hey. No. No. - Control yourself. Don't be a bitch. - It's fine. Don't be a bitch. - No? - They're made by the one and only talented designer who is creating the dress for my wedding. - I... What are you talking about? - Yes. Honey, you don't know how big the wedding is going to be, sweetheart. This is huge. Trust me. It's out of control. Everybody is talking about it. It's just so crazy. And you, my love, listen to me. - You need this star on that runway. - Lucia! Listen, I... - No, Lucy! - I need her? - Totally, babe. - Of course not. I don't know what you're trying to pull, but there's no way it'll happen. - Sari! Relax. - No, never! No. Sara Escribano! Where are you going? - She your sister? - Yeah. - I love her attitude! - I love her. I know. She's the best. I totally need her for Fashion Fest! And after that we can start the techno section and blend it together. So it'd be getting a mix of the boleros and techno. Yeah, it's kind of mellow. I don't know if the label will like it. I don't care if they don't like it. It's what I'd like to do. The plan is to launch it as a surprise. They won't even notice, man. - Fine. Let's record it. - I knew you'd do it. Okay, hit it.

How could you even wish that? - What are you saying, Sara? - Wait. Let me explain. No, I don't want you to be unhappy. Listen, okay... - I can't wish anything. - What are you talking about, Sara? When I was a child, my ability to wish was stolen because my wishes come true, but for someone else, while awful things happened to me. So that's why I'm wishing that you're like, super unhappy, so the opposite happens to you. Hmm. That's why you didn't take the fashion show? That's correct. - But I'm serious.

My dear Lucy, trust me, in this moment, the least of my problems is the current state of the bags under my eyes. I know my people. I know you care about that.

I'll sit here. No, please. It's the same. Careful, please. The wicker is super fragile. Yeah, I'll sit down, like, really carefully. - Dad, don't exaggerate. - Here's your coffee. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Okay. Now, Bobby, we have an announcement. - What? - Wedding time. Awesome! Congratulations. When did you do it? - We haven't yet. - We're going to get married. - We'll do it here. - Here? In the living room? You'll need more chairs then. No, here in Mérida. In the awesome hacienda. Absolutely gorgeous. And guess who's making my gown. Um... who? - Just guess. - Um, Mitsy. No!  Sara Escribano. My God! Honey, congratulations. That's just perfect. Wow. Being married is horrible! - What's your problem? - Are you serious? Mom, please talk to him. You're never getting married, right? - Dad, don't. - Promise me you won't. Give me your word, Roberto. - Sacni. - Good morning, Sara Escribano. We have to hurry and make a wedding gown for my sister, two hundred million accessories, and a collection for Fashion Fest. You accepted? Yeah! Congratulations. Yay. It'll be so cool.

Because you'e my... my best friend. And what does it really matter what people think? Then what does matter, Aarón? Well, what you feel inside of you. Sarita! It's time to sleep. Gimme. I know. But Aarón is your sister's fiancé. Huh? Having my broken heart in this family is enough. Careful. Come. Time to sleep. Let's get some sleep here. Lucy. You all right? I think he doesn't want to marry me. He only ever writes songs for her. Uh, her? His first great love. The one that will be there until his last heartbeat. Hmm. And... So do you know... who she is? I don't know. Maybe his Spanish lover or... some Hungarian he had met one summer. Hmm. Sometimes I feel that maybe... that nobody wants to spend their entire lifetime with me. You're kidding me, right? Lucy... You're a diamond in the rough. You have a huge heart, believe me. Anyone would totally love to spend their life with you. Beginning with you? Beginning with me. Baby sis. - Can I rinse off? - Hey. Then you are actually making my dress? Mm-hmm. Obviously. My skin's way better than when I got here. The heat burns up my face.

We're gonna find crocodiles instead of flamingos. You do realize that the flamingo feathers in my designs are pure fantasy? They don't have to be the real thing. And that is why fantasies are the best. Just trust me. We'll find them. Okay, but what's the plan? Do you want me to steal feathers from some poor, defenseless flamingos, - just like that? - Tsk, tsk. We stole the boat, didn't we? Just relax. I'll steal the feathers. Hey. Have you found what you were searching for? I mean... I came here to set up a covert studio. It's a secret. And I'm writing songs I don't want anyone to know about. It's, um... a more personal composition. Mmm. How mysterious. And why is that? Maybe I still have something left to prove. Hmm. That I have my own voice. Is that why you're obsessed with me finding my own voice, huh? Mm-hmm. Look! There's one. Wow! It's a flamingo feather! What? Ah, it's amazing! Whoa! Whoo! - Amazing! - Look at them go.

You should've gotten an iPad. That doesn't even work. Your boyfriend's profile photo, I'm sure this pic, it's stolen. You can't trust social media. You should know that. - You're old enough. - Hush. He's a swindler. He took these pictures from a Swiss tie catalog. Yes. The finest ties in Lauterbrunnen. You speak German now? Yes. He taught me. He's Swiss. Okay? He's a model. He exists, and his name is Hans. Like that crêpe restaurant in the city. Ugh. Which one? We used to eat there every day as newlyweds, remember? The one at the corner of our first apartment we lived in? - Exactly. - I remember, it was tiny. And that sweet smell would come in the window. Yeah. And now we're going to first position... He dance? - Does your Swiss guy dance? - One. more time, please. Five, six... For the good old times. ...and eight. Of course you remember. Come with me. We dance on just one square? That's right.

Perfect. - Don't move it very much. - Okay. Here we go. It's done. Look at it. You still have time to make changes if you want to, okay? Oh my God. I won't mind if you'd rather wear something else. I get it. Hmm. It's perfect. - Uh, seriously? - Sara. I... love it! It's absolutely spectacular! - Well, there you go. Okay. - You're the best. Now the world is on the verge of knowing... Sara Escribano. Then I Googled it, and it says I should do this to open it. Babe, let me. I'll help you with that. No, I can do it. Don't pull it, just twist. - Then you take this off... - Yeah. And then be careful because the cork has... can sum up so much potential energy. It can easily take an eye out. Can you turn away so I can guarantee there'll be no damages... Honey, let me do it. Put this over here. You see? You just have to turn it. Oh! - Cheers. - Cheers. To our wedding. Whoa. That's good. Say something dirty. Uh, dirty as in... I mean, sexual, as in... Sex from, from... from the coitus. Like, like, fornication, right? As in... sex. - Sex... - Something to turn me on. Sex... sweaty sex. Sex with sweat sex. Sex with sweat, and since this in Mérida, it's even hotter, and the humidity factor effects the equation. - So, we'll be much sweatier... - Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. My love, I want to feel you inside me. Here? Why can't you follow along? - Can't you? - Can't we just have sex like normal? Do you like it? Is it good? Mm-hmm. Yes. ♪ You'll be within me ♪ What are you humming, Sara? The "Wedding March." Oh. - Sexy. - Mm-hmm. - I love him, Sacni. - Roberto? I can't do this to Lucy. Right. So you thought to plan a double wedding with your sister, boyfriend, and the love of your life, right? No, no, no. I never said it was a double wedding. Mm. All right. Sacni, I need a time machine that will take me back to high school. Everything was perfect then. It was my moment. And I let it go by. Because of your bad karma? Ugh. He's planning his transfer to Mérida. He's doing it. I don't want to. What now? You just leave Roberto to me. I am the one and only city boy repellent. - You'll see. - What will you say? Hi, honey! - No, no, no, Sacni, please... - Shh! Shh! - Sara? - Bobby. Listen, Bobby. You have to see Mérida on foot. Okay. All right. - My God, it's very beautiful. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - But it's way too hot. - Let's enjoy it, Bobby. - Let me catch my breath. - It's the most important time of day. Just feel the sun running and caressing all your body. Just a bottle of water and boom, boom, boom. All set. Mmm. Oh God. There's no water? Come on. Hurry up. Have you visited the cenotes? - Hurry, Bobby. - And Sara? Sara will be waiting for us there. Don't worry. - There? - Watch your step here. - Okay. - Just walk. Come on. Follow me. What the heck. Why is Sara taking so long? Can't we wait for her in the shade or something? Patience, Bobby. In Mérida, time doesn't matter, okay? Yeah, but Sara isn't from here. Well, she acts as if she was. You should see how much she's changed since she's been here. Yeah, I've already noticed that. Oh, you have? Hey! She's become a smartypants. You wouldn't even recognize her. Hey. - What? - Listen, Bobby. If you're thinking of moving here, you should really try to get used to it. - What, Mayan? - And the heat. Well, it's not... It's really... It's not so bad. The air conditioning is nice. Makes it all better, right? Sure. The bad thing is the price. Is it expensive? Where you guys are living now, at least 100. One hundred, that's fine. That's reasonable. - I can manage just fine. - That's per week. Oh no! How about an ice cream? Get used to it in Mayan. I'll buy, Bobby. Dang it. I think he's dead. Am I alive? That is correct. Don't worry about the dengue. - It's not deadly. - Really? I have dengue? And heatstroke. But you'll survive. But, sir, you'll have to learn to coexist with my bad karma. Your bad karma? I'm the one under the influence of strong drugs, Sara. I'm serious, Roberto. My life is pure bad luck, okay? You think your life with me is bad luck? No, no, no. Come on now. No, no. Don't make up things I haven't said. I only said that my bad luck is very contagious. Very. Sara, did you send Sacnité to prevent me from moving here? Do you have any idea of how much I'm sacrificing by moving all the way to Mérida to live with you? Uh... Well, that's precisely why I tried so hard to kinda, uh... - Scare me? - No. Warn me? Pfft. Sara, I was very happy to come here. But I was also afraid to realize that what we have is just a memory of what we had. Me coming here confirms that. Listen, Roberto... Well, I love you very much, and we've always gotten along well. And... you're a man who's always... Well, you're very... very punctual. Oh, yeah. Thanks. And, like, very protective. You know? - And also... - Sara, I'm fine. I'm happy. And I want you to feel the same way. You deserve it. But... you can't feel that way if you're not exactly where you want. And... you want... A cinnamon chewing gum. And I'm not it. I love you very much too, Sara. - It's all right. - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm fine. You know... the ring you gave me is super beautiful. Thank you. Uh... Hey, since we have touched on the ring subject, would you actually mind, uh, giving it back to me? - You see, it was my grandmother's. - Oh God. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's passed on from generation to generation. No, I totally understand. No need to explain. - Thank you. - Of course. - I mean, it's yours, okay? - Okay. Thank you. Um... Nurse, do you think you could give us five minutes? - Yes. - Just while we break up, and that's it. - Of course, sir. - Yeah? Thank you. Sara, your hand. There's no ring on it! - Is your wedding canceled, Sara? - Hmm? Mm-hmm. My wedding's canceled. What happened, Sari? Mm. You should ask him instead.

How does it feel? - What? - To marry the love of your life. How does it feel? The dress was designed by my sister, Sara Escribano. Enjoy the show. Trust me, you can't imagine how pretty she is. Just look at her run! This is the event of the year. - Lucy! What did you do? - What? I have thousands of comments on Instagram. They love your dress. So tell me, Sara Escribano, where does your inspiration come from? How does it feel to be born with such amazing talent and genius? You're ridiculous. Tell me, would you like to design officially for your sister? - Cut it out, Lucy, please. - No, Sara. - This is serious. - What? Would you be my official designer? I've been invited to work in Milan. Um... I have to put pressure on Mom. I'm sure she's gonna be late. Uh, walk with me, please. Okay, but is that a yes, a no? Is that a maybe, "I'll think it over"? - I'm traumatized. - Girls! Why... why don't you knock before coming in, ladies? Mom! I mean, I get it. Love is love, but you can't screw some guy with my father right next door. What? Go on, show your face. Lucy, it's Papi. Papi! Hi, Lu. Babies, there is nothing to understand, okay? The thing with Hans was so that your Dad would try harder, and it worked like a charm. Love is love. How does it feel? What? To be in love. What is it like? An explosion of joy. I feel more alive than ever. Okay, fine. Very inspirational conversation, but let them finish reconciling, huh? Let's leave, Lucy. Yup. Yes, I... I'll... You two carry on with your... Very good. Good for you. Please get dressed now. You've got everyone waiting for you at the ceremony. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. I'm on my way.

Well, the suit that Sara made. That's why I'm wearing a robe. I'm sorry, Lucy. I fucking hate your music. I can't stand your influencer freaking world. Man, I loathe your stories. I just... don't feel an explosion of joy when I see you. And... I don't feel more alive than ever. I feel like I don't know you. - Exactly. - And... - I don't want this. - No, no. And me neither. We feel the exact same way. Now what? What will we do with the big wedding party? I'll take care of it. I'll... I'll fix it. It's going to be a disaster. How much longer are they making us wait? Yes. It's been too long already. Hey, where's Lucia? It's very late. Lucy, where are you at? - We still got it. - Hey. Excuse me. - This morning, unbelievable. - What's taking them so long? - Here. - What's wrong? There's a rumor that you're canceling the wedding. Get me out of here. - Come out, Lucy. - No. - It's safe. Come? - You sure? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. SOS. Let's see. - We'll be alone over there. - Okay. Okay, now, will you explain to me what the hell is going on? Bye, wedding. Bye, Aarón. And this goddamn sleeve that is driving me crazy. What are you talking about? Sara, I've seen you two. Aarón and you. No, listen to me. Aarón and I have never done anything. I know that. You don't have to say it. And plus, it has nothing to do with this decision. Sari, I know obviously know Aarón songs weren't for a Hungarian girl or Ukrainian, okay. They were for you. - Uh, Lucy, I don't know what to say. - Sister, I broke the engagement, and I feel I got a burden off of my back. And obviously, I fell in love with the idea of Aarón, but I was not in love with Aarón. I've always dreamed of having your luck. Huh? My luck? No way. What do you mean my luck? - No fucking way. - What did I say? Do you really want my luck? Yeah. But you screwed it up for me years ago! What? Lucy, I've had bad karma ever since you did that. Hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is this? The birthday cake, Lucy, remember? A birthday cake? Remember, Lucy, at one of your parties, I blew out all of the candles on your cake. You were absolutely furious. You made it so you kept every single one of my wishes from that very moment... until forever. You're... pulling my leg, right? Sara, I was five years old. Come off it! Well, you rock at making wishes, Lu. Very powerful. No, no, no. Wait. Wait. Everything I've ever wished for you, all of my life, has been for you to be happy. It's the truth. You are the only one who put that curse on yourself, Sara. You. Seriously? Mm-hmm. Sis, sorry for throwing cake at your face. I'm sorry I pulled your hair earlier. You can have all my wishes now. Ooh! Ooh! That means that the whole time I had a stupid grudge on myself? You and your decisions. So you don't think I have bad karma? Of course not. Oh God, I guess I'm just a moron, right? Oh no, you're not a moron, Sara. I have dreamed of having your luck because you kick ass, girl. You're so talented. You're super fun. And you are so brave. - Brave? - Mm-hmm. Come on.
