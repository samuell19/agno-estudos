Once there was a boy named Paul. He was 12, an age when a boy thinks about growing up. But not for long. Paul had a mother. Paul, what are you doing in there? - Nothing, nothing. Years ago, his mother and father often read him a story. A story he loved very much. It was about a troll who lived under a bridge. One part of the story troubled Paul. Whenever someone tried to cross that bridge, the troll would eat him up. The very thought of being eaten by a troll is frightening, but Paul's mother was so reassuring. There are no such things as trolls anywhere on Earth. Like most boys his age, Paul and his friends get a big kick out of exploring the world. - Hey Paul! There's a magician over here, check it out! And there's always something new. Wow! Paul's also at the age when another new element has come into view, girls. And sometimes they notice him, too. - Go on, go ahead. - Wow! Wow! Most of all, Paul feels life should be an adventure. Full of fantasy and magic. - Watch out, kid. Hey you with the ice cream, get outta here. This is it, final moments in the championship game. The home team trails 99-98, Paul has the ball! He fakes down the court. He's at the top of the key. Only on man to beat. Paul's tied up! Only three. Two seconds, one second. Paul shoots! Not all doors are open to Paul, as yet. That's me, I'm in charge of the doors. We'll get into more of that later. He does keep trying though, doesn't he? Time to go home, Paul. - Hey, I'm home. - Hi honey, how was your trip? The usual. Paul, that TV is awfully loud. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. Tell you what, why don't we all go out to dinner tonight? I'd love to, but Paul has homework. - Yeah, while Paul does his homework, we'll go out to dinner. - Paul, there's leftover casserole for you down in the refrigerator. So if you get hungry later, you can heat it up in the microwave. - Okay. - Okay, we're not going to be very late, so you be sure and finish your homework while we're gone. - Mom? Can we read this together like we used to? Paul, aren't you getting a little big for this? We're gonna be late if we don't hurry. - I have to go, sweetheart. Now you stop being silly and finish your homework. Paul. No such things as trolls anywhere on Earth. Hey, big guy like you doesn't believe in trolls. No matter what his father said, Paul hoped that trolls did exist because he thought that meeting a troll would be so exciting. And so Paul decided it was time to find out once and for all about the realness of trolls. - Excuse me, mister? Do you know where I can find a.. Troll. - Excuse me. Do you know where I can find a troll? - Gee I don't know kid. Did you look under a bridge? I mean that's where I always go when I'm looking for a troll. - Troll! - Has to be here. Where is it? Where, took it. You! You have the pot of gold, don't you? - What pot of gold? - There's supposed to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. - But I haven't seen any pot of gold. - Don't try to pull the dumb act with me, it won't work. I know what dumb is. The computer told us it was taking us to the rainbow's end. - Is that what you're looking for? - I have to tell him now. He's gonna yell, I hate it when he yells. Maybe he won't say anything. I hate it when he doesn't say anything. Back so soon? You couldn't have eaten. - You knew it was a restaurant? You're so grumpy when you don't eat. - I'm very sorry, sir. We did not find the bridge at the end of the rainbow, nor no pot of gold, neither. I pay you for results. - I'll stay with it, sir. Rotten luck! Back to chess. Watch and pounce, that's my motto. You watch, I'll pounce. My queen takes yours. - What do you want? - I'm looking for something, maybe you could help me. - Well, what are you looking for? - A bridge, with a troll under it. - There's no such thing. - There has to be. Trolls live under bridges. - If there were such a bridge, we'd know about it. We're in the bridge business. - You're what? - You see that map. Yeah. Every bridge in the world is indicated by a light on that map. - For real? - We have a description of every bridge. We know its length, we know it's height, we know when it was built, we know everything. So if there were a bridge with a troll-- No, don't go in there. Your move, Baron of Bridges. Time is running out. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. I don't believe it, I lost. You must have had help. I sense a new presence. - Give this boy a reward. Anything he wants, anything in the world. I was, of course, considering the exact same move, but well I think the decent impulse is to encourage young people. - Well thanks, but all I want is to. - Hey boy, not me. Always work with the secretary. I still can't believe it. - I know you don't believe it, but-- - The boy wants a troll, sir. - Good choice, give him a troll. I don't believe we have a troll at the moment, sir. - Get one! You're paid to get results. - I'll start a computer scan of all the bridges, immediately sir. While you're at it, keep you eye out for the bridge at the end of the rainbow. I have overpowering feelings that today is precisely the day that we're going to find our pot of gold. - Yes. Rotten luck. Ready to scan. - We're looking for a bridge with a troll under it. A troll? You're not serious? You can't be serious. - Interested in bridges, boy? - Kind of. - Good choice. Excellent career for a young man. There's money in bridges. Well, bridges have been supporting people for a great span of years, right? Supporting people. Get it? Ready to scan. Troll, can you believe it? Watch the screen, boy. Should be able to see that troll of yours in a few seconds. - Too slow. I'm going as fast as I can. - Not good enough. All right, faster. But don't hold me accountable for accuracy. - All those bridges, wow! There must be a troll under one of them. There is no such thing as a troll anywhere on Earth. Are we surprised? - Rotten luck. - I'm very sorry, sir, but according to the best available data, nobody has had any dealings with any trolls for at least 1000 years. - That's right. There's no real market for trolls in today's economy. Bridges, that's where the money is, bridges. Well, bridges have been supporting people for a great number of years, right? Any sign of the rainbow yet? - I'm afraid not, sir. You're paid, nevermind, nevermind. Give the boy a bridge and send him home. A small bridge. We mustn't encourage the young too much. - I told you before, I don't want any old bridge. I want one that has a troll under it. - Not me, boy, not me. Always work through the secretary. Foolish boy. Doesn't understand the future's in bridges. Call to colors! This is rainbow alert! This is not a test. This is rainbow alert! A rainbow! - Wow! - Who's singing? - Nobody's singing, what are you talking about? This is rainbow alert! Time to act o' Prince of Pounce. - Remove the boy, we must chase that rainbow! I've never seen it so near. - You better leave now. - Wait boy! When you come to your senses and realize the importance of bridges, come back and see me. I'll set you up in the bridge business! Computer to pilot, prepare for takeoff. - Let me give you a piece of advice, boy. Get your feet on the ground, get your hands on some property! - Paul? This is your father. I want you home right now. You have homework, remember? - Are you Paul? - Are you Paul? - Are you Paul? - Let's see, 45 degrees, 19 minutes. Or was it 19 degrees, 45 minutes? Where was that last rainbow? - Excuse me? - Help! Help! Security! White collar crime, help! Help, help! Whoa, why it's only a boy. - Yeah. - But, look at the mess you've made. - I'm sorry, but I didn't do it. What were you saying about rainbows? You must be speaking about my spectrographic analysis of acquiesce crystalline refractions. - Your what? - My spectrogra-- My study of rainbows. - You really study rainbows?? - A highly specific study. I specialize in rainbows emanating from aridness. - What's that? - A constellation. An arrangement of stars in the sky. Aridness is a constellation that people like you call, the river. Yes. Isn't it wonderful when you're truly as wise as me. What about me? - With this computer, I can summon the knowledge of every library from Boise to Sheboygan. Boise, are you standing by? - All the world's knowledge at the tips of my fingers. - Then where can I find a troll? A troll? - A troll? Here we go again. Let's break for lunch. - Not now, maybe later. A corned beef sandwich? - I want to know about-- A hot fudge Sunday? - Tell me about-- Whipped cream? - Tell me about-- A cherry? - I, I want you to tell me about-- You know who won't like this. - Trolls! You people get so grumpy when you don't eat. - I've checked as far back as 1972, there's nothing about trolls. - Why 1972? - Well, that's as far back as these things go. Anything before that is old knowledge. - You said you had all of man's knowledge at the tips of your fingers. - These fingers aren't done yet, boy. They're about to examine the book of old knowledge. Better get back to rainbows before you know who gets angry. - Troll, t-troll. That used to be spelled with a T. - Yeah. - It still is. - It's wonderful when things preserve their heritage that way. Tr, troll. A mythical monster said to inhabit inland waters. Great! Where can I find some inland waters? - No no no no no no, not so fast, boy. It says it's mythical. That means it doesn't exist. - Well, that can't be right. It must say more than that. Are you sure that's the only book with? Hey, where you going? Mister. Hey mister! Hey mister, where you going, mister? Paul, you are not welcome here. These doors are now closed to you. Guards, seize this boy! Unauthorized personnel on premises. - Noisy, isn't it? - I couldn't open the doors. - Well they can be stubborn. Were you looking for something? - A troll. - I don't think anybody's talked about trolls here now for, 100 years. - Do you know where I can find one, then? Well why don't you try another door. - Where did you come from? - A place called the silence. - The silence? I don't understand what's going on. I don't know where the silence is, and I can't find a troll. Then you keep telling me to open all these doors and none of them will open. - Why not? - They're stuck! Well why don't you just keep on trying. And remember, the choice is yours. - Don't you know your future's in bridges, boy? - All of man's knowledge at the tips of my fingers! - Paul, when are you gonna grow up? - Hey, where'd he go? Unauthorized personnel on premises. Intruder alert. Goodbye seeker of trolls. - Hello? Hello? - Minestrone or just tomato? Barley soup or maybe potato? Meatless soups for the hoy malloy. But trolls, we like a little boy! - That's real dumb. - You're dumb, too. - Why? - Because you came into the woods looking for a troll that might eat you up. - How'd you know I was looking for a troll? - Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. What's your name? - Paul. - Don't think I ever met a Paul before. Wait, there might have been a Paul in Boston during the revolution. With, with metal I believe. Fast, on a horse. Was he related to you? No. My name is Ofoeti. Did you come for my party? - What kind of party? - A wonderful party. There hasn't been a party like this in, almost 100 years. - I can't stay. - Then why did you come? - I'm trying to find a troll. - How will you know when you find one? What do they look like? - Well they live under bridges. And they eat children. - I'm washing my clothes. Eat children. I can't believe the things people say about me. - What do you mean? - I'm a troll. - You can't be. - Of course I am. Trolls live under bridges, don't they? Would you believe me if I cooked you up with my dirty clothes? Now that is dumb. Convinced? - I guess. I, I don't know. - That's Socrates, I've been waiting for him for ages. Of course, you can't set your hourglass by a turtle. - A turtle? - Hello, Socrates, how are you? Ofoeti, there's a human being standing behind you. - I know that, Socrates. He's a friend of mine. Friend? - My 100 years are up tonight. I get it. Well, any friend of yours, Ofoeti, um, you know what I mean? - Thank you, Socrates. Why don't you come out of your shell and meet him? Must I? - Talk to him, Paul, maybe you can get him to come out. - Me? Please come out, Socrates! Ofoeti, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you. Thank you, Socrates. - Are you really a turtle? - Yes, and you are a human being. Human beings can be very cruel, you know. They pull us from the sea and put us in their soup. Or they clip pieces of metal to our bodies. - What's that for? - A tag that tells when and where I was pulled from my ocean home onto some human's boat. All part of some scientific experiment. I think they are following me. Dear. It's Kalotte. - Who's Kalotte? - The mermaid. Hurry Socrates! - Telling a turtle to hurry is a contradiction. - Hurry, Socrates! Kalotte! Kalotte, please try to remember. It's feet for walking and fins for swimming. Dear Ofoeti, I keep forgetting. - It's all right, Kalotte. He's a friend of mine. A friend of yours. Well of course. I'm so sorry I screamed. I wasn't thinking. That's all right. Kalotte, this is Paul. - Does he pull hair? How do you do, Paul? - Paul, this is Kalotte. - Hi. - The most beautiful creature in the world. Well he can see that for himself. Socrates, you're here. - Yes, how are you, Kalotte? Could you help me out of my fins? Thank you. There you go. - You have zippers. Don't worry, Paul, they're nylon, they won't rust. - But mermaids aren't supposed to have zippers. - Ofoeti, he doesn't believe I'm a mermaid. - And he doesn't believe I'm a turtle. - And he doesn't believe I'm a troll. He has trouble accepting some things about our world. Rainbow sighted! - They followed me. - It's the rich man. He's not after you. He's looking for gold. No. - What's wrong? - It is very dangerous for Kalotte. - The rich man's after my hair. - What does he want with your hair? - Paul, come here, come. Feel Kalotte's hair. Isn't it soft, and smooth? - Yeah. - Isn't it the most beautiful hair you've ever felt? - Yup. - That's because it's spun with gold. The gold at the end of the rainbow. Coordinates locked. This is it, prepare to land. - I've got to go. - What about our party? Too dangerous. - Socrates, it's my last day. - Last day for what? - Um, I know. We could have the party at my place. - That's the answer. - Paul, how would you like to go to Kalotte's palace under the water? It's one of the great wonders of the unknown world. Very few human beings have ever been allowed to see it. Come on, we can take the elevator. - Socrates, help me with my zippers. - The choice must be his. - I know that, Socrates. I know that. - Now that I see your palace, it's wonderful. Like you said, Ofoeti. And I truly believe. I believe you're a mermaid, and you're a turtle, and you're a troll. - I knew he believed, I can always tell. - Paul, would you like to stay here forever and always be with Ofoeti? That'd be great. Can I? - If you like. - Wait till my parents hear this, they'll flip. They don't even think you're real. - Tell him, Ofoeti. - Tell me what? - Paul, your parents are right, we're not real. - You are, I heard you sing, and I can see you. - Yes, you can see us. We're your special dream. But someone who believes in us the way you do is rare. - You see, Paul, every 100 years Ofoeti must find someone just like you. - Someone who believes. - Someone who cares. - And if 100 years goes by and he doesn't find someone just like you, he dies. - He dies? You mean like for good? - It's been 99 years, 364 days since Ofoeti found someone who believed. - Today's my last day. Only you can save me. - How? - The rules. He must have a choice. - Its' so easy for you. I have been standing beneath that bridge for 100 years waiting for children who never come. - The choice must be his, not yours. You can't break the rule. - What rule? - They grow up so much faster than they used to with their fancy hair and designer jeans. By the time they're ready to go to school they have already lost the wonder of childhood. They don't believe in magic, or trolls. I'm down to my last day. - I believe in you, Ofoeti. You'll live. - Maybe not, Paul. Maybe this time I won't. - Let's see what's going on. - No. - Paul! - Paul. - Paul! Come on we have to do something! - No back, back! Then it's on your conscience! Hurry up, we've not got all day! - What are you doing? - We're gonna blow up this bridge. - You can't! This is the troll's bridge. - Trolls? There's no such thing. - Yes. - Keep that wire coming! - Please help me. He's trying to blow up the bridge. We gotta stop them. - I couldn't do that. My rainbow research has revealed a pot of gold beneath that bridge. - That's Kalotte's hair! - The rich man is most appreciative of my findings. - Please listen to me. - You know, there's not a rainbow anywhere. Are you sure this is the right bridge? - You can't do this! - When the rainbow led us to this bridge before, my tracer indicated the presence of a turtle. - That's Socrates! - The turtle is still here. This must be the bridge. - Begin the countdown! 60, 59. - Harry, go on, get her outta here, she's gonna blow! 56. - No, stop! 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46. - Wow! 45, 44, 43, 42. - Wait a minute, the rich man said I can have a bridge. I'll take this bridge. 38. - Give me my bridge. 36. - Stop! - Rotten luck. You stopped. You're supposed to get results, why did you stop? - We've run into a little problem, sir. It's a boy. A boy is the problem? - This is that boy which was there when you won your chess game. You may recall him. - I recall that boy. - You said he could have a bridge, sir. He wants this bridge. - He may have this bridge. However, I never promised that it would be in one piece! You may begin your countdown. And this time I want results. - Proceed! 34, 33. - It had to be done, boy. You'll understand when you grow up. - Never! 30, 29. - Help! Please, please, somebody help! 27. - What's going on? I stopped time. - And he was gonna die because no one believed in him and his 100 years were up, and I saved him. - Yeah, good for you, Paul. - And there was this bunch of kids. They're real funny because they wore these old time clothes. And I played basketball against this really really big guy and I beat him. I can do anything when I'm with Ofoeti. He's not like any grownup I've ever met. - Well what about the grownups back at the bridge? The rich man and his gang. They was trying to blow up the bridge and get Kalotte's hair. It's made of gold. But you sure fixed them. Stopping time, that was great. - Well, nobody can stop time forever, Paul. - What do you mean? Why not? - Well when time stops, nothing grows. Not a plant, not animals, not even boys. - You mean you can't stop them? They can still blow up the bridge? - If time doesn't go forward, you won't be able to grow up. - I don't want to grow up. - Why don't you? - I don't want to grow up and be like those men on the bridge. Chasing gold and blowing up things. Grownups are all so stupid. - Not all, Paul. You're a thoughtful and loving person. You can still be you even if you do grow up. - Please, I'm scared. I feel like something's happening and I don't know what it is. I wanna see Ofoeti. - Okay, let's go. - The rich man's trying to blow up the bridge. - Don't worry, I've stopped time. - Ofoeti. - He's dying. - He won't. I believe in you, Ofoeti. Won't that save you? - So we meet again, Ofoeti. - You know each other? From a long time ago. You see, trolls are mischievous creatures that live in a part of the silence. A place called Aridness. - The river? - That's right. Hundreds of years ago Ofoeti slid down the rainbow just for the fun of it. - Yes, that's how we met. - It was easy sliding down the rainbow, but he couldn't slide back up. - You couldn't go home again? It's not so bad. Kalotte and Socrates come and play with me and I have my young friends here. - Yes, boys and girls just like you Paul. Who believe in Ofoeti and decided to stay. Children from all over the world started to disappear. - Eaten by trolls, the story goes. - Wait a minute, when you say stay, do you mean forever? Never go home. Ofoeti, is that what you want me to do? - I told you to tell him, Ofoeti. - I know, Socrates. - I just can't. - But Paul, you could be a child forever. Now wouldn't that be fun? - But I'd miss my home. My friends and my mom and dad. - No, you wouldn't have to miss them. This will help you to forget. - No Paul, don't do it. - Ofoeti, if he doesn't stay, you'll die. - Everyone's time runs out. 26, 25. - I thought you had stopped time. - It was a slip. - You won't do it again. - No. - Wait a minute. If you can stop time and stuff like that, do you think you can do something for Ofoeti? - What did you have in mind? - Well you and Ofoeti come from the silence, do you ever go back? - I go back and forth all the time. - And they believe in trolls where you come from? - Of course, we all believe in trolls in the silence. - Well then, do you think you can take Ofoeti with you? He'll be with people who believe, and then he wouldn't have to die. - Would you like to go back, Ofoeti? - What about my friends? The rich man's going to blow up the bridge. - I'll hold time till everybody's safe. - When you get to the silence, will you remember me? - Will I? - Every time Paul thinks of you, you'll hear him. And you'll feel what he feels. - That'll be wonderful. - But will I hear you? - I'll send you a message. - Paul will grow up, but he'll always remember you and the joy of childhood. And because he's going back, he'll be able to share that memory with others. - You mean because I have kept him here all this time. - They couldn't grow up and teach their children to believe in trolls. - I'm ready. - I believe you are. - Help me gather the children. Socrates, hurry up. - I am hurrying. 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15. - The turtle's gone. - What about the gold? - The gold's gone too, and you'll never get it. - You're giving up a big future in bridges, boy. 10. - I don't believe in your future. And I do not believe in you. Six, five. - I do believe he don't believe. - We're depreciating. One. Paul, we're home. Hey big guy, we brought dessert. I'll send you a message.
