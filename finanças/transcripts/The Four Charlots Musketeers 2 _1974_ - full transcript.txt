THE FOUR CHARLOTS MUSKETEERS 2 Fight the Cardinal We are the Musketeers, the musketeers of the King Masters in swordplay, honour is our law. To go to war, that is our mission. One for all, all for one. One for all, all for one, like the five fingers in the hand. We are the Three Musketeers plus One Summary 1st Part The Duke of Buckingham, the prime minister of England is crazily in love with the Queen of France. He is not alone. The Cardinal Rechelieu is also in love with the Queen. - What a shame, Cardinal. But he's not lucky. One for all, all for one. The inseparable Musketeers, dArtagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, are the best swordsmen in the kingdom. They never learn and fight for everyone a trifle even with a tenfold enemy. In the fight against the odds, they would often succumb, if not for the devotion and cleverness of their squires. Their four squires are Planchet, Mousqueton, Bazin and Grimaud. Closer, closer. The squires used various tactics and surprising tricks, that constantly bodered the opponents of their masters. Very often the musketeers were victorious thanks to them. Betrayal! It stings! Constance, a charming maid and the Queen's confidante, and the charming dArtagnan fell in love. It was mutual and incurable love at first sight. Father Joseph, and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, will kidnap this young woman. They wanted to torture her to find the Queen's secret, concerning Buckingham. This astonishing torture will happen whimsical merry-go-round. And Father Joseph ends up being subjected to torture. Tighten! The squires with Constance hid in a cottage deep in the woods, because they feared severe retribution. We will represent you at the Queen's. Only women can enter, in the Queen's chambers Such a trifle to us, do not worry. Bazin and Mousqueton replace Constance at the Queen. What is wrong with you? Father Joseph made holes on all walls and ceilings ... ... to hear what's going on within the queen's. You had that necklace the day when I first saw you. The brave musketeers are overwhelmed by a numerical majority, and thrown in the Bastille, along with Mousqueton. His Majesty the King! Planchet, Grimaud and Bazin with the Queen's help use daring tactics, which gives more hope on the gallows rather than on success. They try the impossible to free their masters and Mousqueton. Then, unforeseen circumstances suddenly call into question everything. His Majesty the King. Is this always like this, without anyone? Eventually they manage to lock in the Bastille the real Father Joseph, the real Cardinal and the real King. After such a bold adventure the refugees from the Bastille... ... will have to be more prudent without ever forgetting. This is the work of villains, who are smarter than us. Come take a look., Father Joseph, Eminence, come here. Deep in the forest the musketeers exchanged Constance... for their heroic actions doing housework. Athos and Porthos took care of the laundry. Aramis became a shepherd. D'Artagnan was so in love, that he forgot singing was his weakness. Fencing Champions, honor is our law ... if we fight, it's because ... No Mousqueton, please, you sing very ba... But, Constance, I don't. It... Parrot. - Was it really bad, Mousqueton? - No, sir, you sing very well. I thought so too. Isn't that wonderful, Madame? This is a decoration above all decorations. - Yes, it's beautiful. - Right? I'm a villager at heart. It is done. We can have dinner. - Great. - Great! - Smells good! After you. Love at first sight that dominated d'Artagnan and Constance, ... would invite romantic moonlight walks. When I'm close to you, "Quand je suis tout pres de vous" my heart beats wildly "Mon coeur devient un peu fou" I admit. "Je vous l'avoue" Tell me, if like me, "Dites-moi si comme moi" do you feel this sweet emotion? "vous sentez ce doux emoi?" If you can notice it? "Lorsque ce front le notoit" Tell me. "Dites-moi" When I'm close to you, "Quand je suis tout pres de vous" I lose my mind. "Je suis sans dessus-dessous." I admit. "Je vous l'avoue" Tell me, if like me, "Dites-moi si comme moi" do you feel this sweet emotion? "vous sentez ce doux emoi?" If you love me, yourself. "Si vous m'aimez, vous et toi" Tell me. "Dites-moi" When I see your eyes so sweet, "Quand je vois vos yeux si doux," I know I'm yours. "je sais que je suis a vous" I admit. "Je vous l'avoue" Tell me, if like me, "Dites-moi si comme moi" do you feel this sweet emotion? "vous sentez ce doux emoi?" If love is your law. "Si l'amour est votre loi" Tell me. "Dites-moi" In the Louvre, Bazin replaced Constance with great devotion. If only Your Majesty could give the other leg. We have to speak quietly. They listen to what I'm saying. I noticed it when I saw a mouse climbing the wall of the fireplace. You see? A little mouse can sometimes change the course of history. - Oh, no. It is... - What's the matter with you, Angela? - Are you afraid of mice? - But no, it's just ... Apparently you're not very well. Not that. I feel like my cheeks are burning. You look pretty good. Father Joseph was still eavesdropping. Do you hear Listen! I'm sure. You will see. More and more I feel the king owes everything to Cardinal Richelieu. I have to admit that the Cardinal is really a great man. Eminence. - What's going on? - The queen is losing her mind. Yes, and why is she loosing her mind? She said you were a great person. I mean, I'm under the impression that she's aware we are listening to her. Does not matter. The queen will be in trouble soon, after what she did. I wish, Madame, you to be by my side... when the councils' ball begin. It will take place in a few days. I'm really looking forward to it. And put that diamond necklace I gave you, on that night. It suits you very well. But, Sir, I have other jewells for such an occasion. Anyway, Madame ... ...you don't have a nicer jewelry than the one I want you to use. Angela, I'm lost. That's awful. I have to wear that diamond necklace on the councils' ball. The king has never commanded me to take this or that piece of jewelry. The cardinal must have his fingers in it He may know about the necklace. I am lost. - Maybe not, Your Majesty. - What do you mean? The four nobles that thanks to you managed to escape from the Bastille, are devoted to you in body and soul. If you ask them, they would leave immediately and expose to danger, ... to bring you the jewel. - So I have some hope? - Sure, Majesty. - Are you sure? - Definitely. Tell your friends to pass on this ring to the duke. He gave it to me as a reminder of his love. This will identify my true messengers. Trust them, Madame, they'll do it for you. I will also write a letter which they pass on to the duke. What if the queen tries to notify Buckingham, to get the necklace back? In such a short time, not likely. Believe me, Eminence ... ... you won't be sure of winning until you have the necklace in your safe. What do you suggest? It would be enough if I do without delay, a trip to London. Buckingham is my cousin and we have a great relationship. It would be enough if I told you that I have a Queen's letter. Just like the Queen's handwriting. Of course, because I wrote it. My lord ... to pass on ... ... my diamond necklace to my girlfriend, Milady de Winter. That's great. As always, you proved your abilities. Do you think that God will forgive me, for this little scam? For the truth to come to light, God will forgive. I hope you are generous to me. As usual, Milady. A little more, if you can. Your prayers will be heard. Trust me, Eminence. There 's a boat in the harbor. I'll get to England sooner than everyone else. And the duke will give me the necklace. Goodbye Constance, everything will work out. Goodbye. - Bye. - Trust us. Due to time constraints, it was a short but touching farewell. Goodbye, Constance, my heart stays with you. D'Artagnan is on his way to England accompanied by his loyal friends. This modern Robin Hood transformed by his mission..., ... into Jason and his Argonauts in search of the new golden fleece. The diamond necklace of the Queen of France. They didn't know Milady, the Cardinal's emissary had left a few hours earlier. In fact she arrived in Calais first. Stop! I''ll will look for the port commander. We have to wait, Madame. The Commander has only now received orders regarding your embarkation. The ship that will take you to England, will leave tomorrow at noon. Is there a good inn here? Yes, the inn, is just next door. I'll take you there. Take the luggage. It will be better if you don't stay here, it could attract attention. I agree, Madame. The ship's captain will come for you in person tomorrow... ...and accompany you on board. - Rochefort? - Yes, Madame? Be here with your guards and a carriage in two days. - Wait for me until I arrive. - Trust me, Madame. We've finally arrived. Hey, buddy, there's a ship here, which goes to England? That one from the English. It will leave tomorrow but you must have a permit. It will work with money. The captain will embark you. We'll find a way. Is anyone on board? What do you want? - I'd like to speak to the captain. - I'm the captain. - Are you going to London? - Yes. Great. - How much? - Not today. Tomorrow at noon. No, not tomorrow. Right now. It's not possible now. Tomorrow at noon. But we want to ... go ... now. Do you understand So if you can swim, bet who will be there first. You bastard ... I'll teach you! Maybe it's better to leave tomorrow than never, right? Well, maybe you're right. We'll go tomorrow. Yes, at noon. Come on. - Good. Tomorrow then. Goodbye. - Tomorrow at noon. Yeah, as you wish. So we have wine. - Where are we going to sleep? - In the inn. That's a good idea. Let's go. Milady, a bright and charming spy knew that spying is an art. - I got thirsty on that dusty road. - I'm dying of thirst. Fill my glass. A little more. Gentlemen, let's drink to the lady, for which we are willing to die. To the queen! And the success of our mission. Here, gentlemen help yourselves. Here you have wine. - Nice. - Very good. It seems good, but is just for wetting the lips. I'll fill it again once you finish. Otherwise you will spill it. - Hurry up innkeeper, we are thirsty. - I'm running. They can't wait, can they? Well, they eat well. - I'm glad we arrived safe. - We never know with them, do we? We almost fought a while ago. Luckily we were there. -Do you have the letter for Buckingham? - Yes. - And the ring? - Yes, I have it here, look. You're crazy? You don't need to show. Give me the letter first. - Why? - Because we'd rather not take a risk. I'll have the letter. I sew it into the lining of my vest. - If they search you, shut up. - Yeah, that's right. - And if you lose your vest. - Why should I lose my vest? You drink like a rainbow. It's good mine wine from the Loire, right? It's pure juice. - Who is that woman? - She's beautiful. - A real princess. What's the matter with you, Madame? Take me to my room, I'm not well. - Always him. - He's great with women. - Yes, but he loses in the game. - While we're at it, we'll play tarot. - Yes, that's a great idea. - Innkeeper, bring us the cards. Thank you. - I feel cramped, help me, please. - Right away. Still. One more. Another ... - Are you feeling better? - A little better, thank you. - Would you like some cherry? - No no. In that case, I just need a little attention. Yours. I went through so many difficult trials. - If I can ... - There's nothing you can do. I'm coming back from England. The man I loved... ... has been assassinated by order of the Cardinal. My God, what am I saying? Despair makes me careless. Don't worry Madame, I have good reason to hate the cardinal. So the enemies of our enemies will be our friends, isn't it? Until death, Madame. A glass of cherry is best for refreshment. Great. Look there! - What's the matter with you, Madame? - Take me to my room. I'm not feeling well. - Well, we can't play now. - Yes, we'll play picket. In the morning... ... the squires sought their masters in vain. - So what? - They are not here. - They're not at the port office - Still haven't found them? - No! - We inspected all the rooms. - And the beauty's room? - Well, it's locked. -They must be there. - At the Marquese? She left in the morning. - With them? - No, with one naval officer. It's like I said. They will be there. - Do you think? - You have to reckon with everything. Such a noble person? I would be surprised. - You don't know them. - One for all, all for one. - Their password. - Well, let's go see. - Yes, let's go. - Here we go. I would be surprised. Come on, see? The room is empty. They are not here. - What? - It's them. I know them. - They are dead. They are dead! - Help me pull them out. This is the first time here I see something like that. My lord, wake up. Wake up quickly! Oh my God! The bell is ringing! You need to go to England! That's a woman's business. There is nothing that can be done. They are dead. Dead? No they're not. Have you ever seen a dead snore? They are simply drunk, nothing more. Here is the key to the mystery. Cherry! That's what cherry does. It goes to the head. When it's good ... Well, very good. It goes up, it goes up... I'm tired, you know? - What's wrong with him? - Well ... he fell asleep. - What? What? - She mixed a sleeping potion in the drink! She must be a spy under Cardinal's orders. - They'll be like this for a long time! - Never. They need to be woken up in anyway. Give me the water. Do it! - Specially the one here. - Let's try it. - And now you. - It is not possible. - The bell is sounding! - What are we going to do? - It's calling. - The ship leaves in ten minutes. The next one leaves in two days. - Do you have the ring? - What? Yes. - I have the letter. - We have to replace them. - But we can't go like this. Yes, we will put their clothes and go instead of them. - Very good. - Great. Do it! - But I do not speak English. - Catch! - So let's go. - So ... Take this. - I can't make it! - No, this is better. - And the beards and mustaches? You will see. I'll take care of my beard. Here we go. The ship! Wait! - Wait for us. - We're coming with you! - Get down the bridge! - Come on, it's us! Bring down the bridge! Excited by their mission, the squires take the ship to England. - Quickly. - Don't push it. Watch out the steps! They landed in London during a rainy spring morning. Watch out, it's slippery. This letter left me profoundly touched ... Milady... It's exciting to love a queen, from another people culture. I don't know what I'm going to do now. It is necessary, Mylord ... ... to give me the diamond necklace as soon as possible. I know, but I don't know where my head is. Where's the locker? My memory is failing. Mylord, try to remember. You always kept your jewelry in that cabinet. It could be there. In my cabinet, perhaps, but I don't remember where. I can't find the key to open a secret wall. Where did I leave the key? Where did I put it? I know! I gave it to William, my secretary... ...because I never find it when I need it. And William, where is he? It's the weekend, he only comes on Monday. But, Mylord, I can't wait until Monday. There's nothing I can do. Come in. Sir, four French musketeers want to see you urgently. Four French Musketeers? What is it again? Here are their names. - I don't know them at all. - They say it's important. - How they look? - Maybe a little tired. - Let them in. - Yes sir. Milady could you please wait for me in the next room? But, Mylord, why are you seeing musketeers you don't know? Musketeers from France can bring me good news from the one I love. Come in, gentlemen. Gentlemen, what do I owe the honor of your visit? The Queen of France has commissioned us to give you an important message. It's a little wet. It got wet, when we fell into the water. - To the Thames ... - Queen of France. Mylord hand over my diamond necklace to the recipients of this letter. I think of you with sincerity and love. Anne. Are you making fun of me, in my face... ... claiming this soaked paper is a letter from the Queen of France! - Yes, we swear. In your honor. - On yours? - On your, Mylord ... - In short, honestly anyway. - You are the tellers of false truths! Here is the real letter from the French queen,... ...which was delivered to me by a faithful friend. -Not possible! That's the right letter. - Not the one you have! Because your letter is fake! -Our letter is the right one. - No, it's my letter. I'll keep it. My lord, let me reveal these fraudsters. False beards, false mustaches, and my letter is the fake one, right? Exactly! Don't you know him? He was Angela, the queen's maid. I don't know anyone. Don't make me an idiot. And me? The great Gertrude? - I exchanged your clothes! - What are you saying about my clothes? My lord, how much longer will you endure, being insulted like this? You're right. Guards, take these impostors to the Tower of London. It can't be. I... show him! Sir, on behalf of our beloved queen ... Listen to me. This ring. Doesn't it tell you anything? - It's only a ring. - Please, look well. I know this ring, this is my ring! - Yes, you gave it to the queen. - I never gave it to the queen! Someone stole it from me. You are thieves! We are not thieves! Guards, take these idiots away and have them hung up immediately. - But sir, that's not possible. - Why isn't that possible? -The hangman is not in, on weekends - On weekends? Then be they hanged on Monday, early in the morning. - Take them away. - Monday, is okay? - Take them away. Sir, don't trust this woman. - Yes, don't listen to her. - She wants to harm the Queen. - Sir, don't believe this woman. -She spies on the queen for the cardinal - She already put our masters to sleep. - She's a witch! Sorry, for this unpleasant scene. My Lady, without you, the queen would be lost. Plus, we have to wait until Monday morning, to open the cabinet. - It'll be better for us two. - Yes. We'll talk about her. - They're polite, aren't they? - And he speaks good English. Yes, they are polite, speaks English but so far... It is clean and comfortable. - Yes, it's drowning nicely. - And the view. - Too bad it's raining. - We're in London. Planchet, come here. - Great view. - I've always wanted to visit England. - The carriages move on the left. - See London and die. It's wonderful to talk to you about the queen. It's beautiful to bring back love memories. - Oh yes. Many people drink to forget. I drink to remember. - Attention! Intruders. - Hold on to the bowl. Thank you, Mom. - What is it? - Porridge. Good for your health. Yuck. Your bowl. It's not that bad. Enjoy your last breakfast. Why did he say last breakfast? Because it's a disgusting breakfast. Hot breakfast served in the room, it's better than in the Bastille. But I don't want it. Tell me about her. Do you remember that beautiful evening? The Queen's Day? She was charming. And that evening I gave to the queen for her holiday the ring ... ... as proof of love. But what the ...? They didn't lie, the four of them. Then they're not scammers, nor even thieves! They are the queen's envoys. So you are ... It's you ... Hey, stop! Stop. Stop! Wake up gentlemen. The Chaplain is coming. The Chaplain is coming to bless you. Put the clothes on. Come on. Quickly! What about Chaplain? I think he says Chaplain got hurt. - Who was injured? - It's Chaplain. - We have a visitor. - That should be Chaplain. - He doesn't seem hurt. - But it doesn't look good. Good, that's good. - Today, they'll let us go today. - Yeah, calm down. Venerable Knight Planchet of Rinardier. Venerable Knight Bazin of Bazinoir. Venerable Knight Grimaud of Fechnier. - And Mr. Mouskakon. - Queton. Mousqueton of Moustiquer. In England, only nobles have the privilege of being decapitated. We are not nobles. - So, if you don't mind ... - No, we don't mind. ... Youl'll be hanged. Hanged. But because you are a stranger noble, you'll be given the due honor. Yes, fast or long, it doesn't matter. I do not understand. To ask God to forgive your mistakes and sins, and avoid hell. You certainly don't want to die as sinners. - What did he say? - Friends ... - What? - Let's go. - Slowly. They can't start without us. - I'm innocent! - I could break my leg. - Be careful! Get out of the way. They are inocent. Get out of the way! - It's touching. - That is so beautiful. How beautiful! Do you understand? They're playing for us. We have the right to first class execution. They are innocent! Come closer, come on. - Go there. - No, I'm not going. Do not worry. Come on, boys. Out of the way! They are innocent! Gentlemen, do you have any last wishes? I would like to ... learn English. The request cannot be fulfilled, I am sorry. No, this way, please. I want to pee. But this is a little high. I won't get there ... Here, here. My hair, it hurts a little, you know? Here, it hurts. Out of the way! They are innocent! Stop. They are innocent! They're messengers from the Queen of France. No, don't hang them! Mylord, thank you! - But you are... - Yes, in the Louvre ... Great Gertrude! - What a shame. - Queen's maid. - It's me. - She almost executed him. - Twice! Please come up. Come on. I know you. At the stretcher! Yes! One here, the other there and I was in the middle ... And he was the girl, little Angela. He was a confidante of the Queen of France, right? Watch him, when he's that gay. When he is drunk, anything can happen. These brave nobles, disguised squires, saved my honor. For my friends ... Hooray! Here's the locker that contains the Queen's necklace. Also, I have a letter prepared for you,... ... which I hope will allow you to cross the canal without difficulty. Otherwise, I left especially prepare a ship for you to Dover. If I didn't drink a lot last night, and remembered you... ... gentlemen , this morning ... you're gone. As you say in your beautiful country, there is a benevolent God. And also for hangmen ... I hope God will protect you and help you save the queen's honor. Goodbye gentlemen. You forgot your locker! - Forgive us. - You were distracted. An anticyclone from the Azores turned north and caused a pressure below the lsland evoked over the canal very much severe weather disturbances. Hey, guys! Bazin wrapped the locker very carefully in his coat... and tied it to the crate he was sitting on. The storm swayed the ship and the twine relaxed a little. Bazin didn't notice the package slid from one side to the other. But someone noticed. Someone we'll know soon enough. Don't leave me! Beautiful weather came after the storm. They arrived in Calais with a beautiful sunshine. Let's go, fast. Do you have it? - Well? - Succeeded! - Yes, we have it! Show it, quickly. What? What's that supposed to mean? - That's not possible. = It's her! - What the ...? - It's her! - But who? - Milady! - What Milady? - Who is it? - What's that supposed to mean? - No, Milady. She had a mustache! - Sure, that impostor! - That handsome guy. - It was Milady! - She was, of course. - She tricked us! - She got us. - Look, Rochefort. Come on! They're leaving. Let's go after them. We have to catch them! Hurry up. Do it! - Sir, they're catching up with us. - Stop! Turn around. We have to block their way. Look, Rochefort and his men are turning. - We'll have to fight. - Ride across the forest and catch the carriage. Let's wait for them here, it is a good place. Forward! Attack! Don't let them go. We will attack from the front. Don't let them go. I don't want to see any rider on the ground! Everyone in the saddle! How are you Rochefort? Hi, it's me. Will you allow me? I'm lucky I found you. You mistaken the package. Mousqueton, help here. You have no right to do that! Done! Maybe we're going too fast. - Give it to me! - How is it done? I got the locker! What? What? Slowly. Slowly! - My hat. - Your horse, Rochefort, you're done. - Get off the horse or I'll stab you. - Give me my hat back! - You'll pay for this. - Look at him. You will answer to the cardinal. Bring me those horses! Come on. Do it! Bring me those horses right away! Hold strong! Stop! Wait! - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Did you break anything? - What? - Where are they? - I held them. - You go over there. - Yeah, I'll go there. - We have to go there. - What? - Let's go. Attention! Planchet, slower. We have the locker. - What is it? - It's a hen, isn't it? Put her away. - See what's going on. - Yes, I'll take a look. There are no horses! - I'm scared to ride at night. - We don't go at night. We're in a tunnel. What? It wasn't a tunnel. - It's a weird station. - We'll take the locker. What is the station? - Planchet! - Grimaud! Planchet! - Look at them there. - I got the box! - We have the locker! - Look, sir. - And we have horses again. - Quickly to the saddle. That box! - You are here. - I ... I this way. Isn't it too early? ............Too late - What happened to you? - I lost my hat. - Everything is lost. - Don't say that. We lost one battle, but we didn't lose the whole fight. - What do you mean? - No rider or horse... ... is able to travel from Calais to Paris without stopping. So, at what station can they get eight fresh horses? There is only a station in Beauvais, but we are far from it. Isn't there a guard station around here, where we could sound the alarm? Yes, there is one here in Bretevil, about two kilometers away. If only we had horses. Look, one there. And you think he would mind to take us to Bretevil? Let's see. If it can be caught. Slowly. This way. - Do it, Rochefort. Follow him! - Okay. So get up. I don't know what else I can do. - Then talk to him. - With him? Gently. That's it, fast! Get on, Milady. Milady left with rested horses and a strong reinforcement. Unlike our musketeers, their squires and their horses. The animals will not make it. They're exhausted. Not just the horses. I want to sleep terribly. Bazin, give me the locker. You can sleep. Untill we get there, the locker will stay with me. - I can't anymore. - Have courage, Planchet. Courage. - I have it over my head. - I'm starving and thirsty. We'll gain strength in Beauvais in ten minutes. Turn left. - We're already here. - But a little late. - Is the inn far away? - No, I see the sign at the end of the street. Make sure these poor horses have a large dose of oats. And saddle immediately the horses that we'll take. We'll order dinner for now. After join us. They are always the same. Welcome, gentlemen. I have a table here for you and accommodation. Please, please. We don't want acomodation but eight horses. Just a little snack. And get the horses ready. Eight horses? That's impossible gentlemen. Where would I get them? Just eight saddled and ready horses standing in the yard. But gentlemen, those horses belong to these gentlemen. Eight horses. Do you hear And quickly. We don't have time to lose. - Leave the man. - What's the matter with you? - He got orders. - And from whom? All the horses from the station are confiscated on the order of the cardinal. I only get orders from the king. - Do you have a pass? - Sure. Here it is. Gentlemen, no! Gentlemen, don't fight here! Listen. - It's starting again. - Are they starting again? We'll have to get them out of trouble again. - They're fighting again. - We would do best leaving. - That's what I was thinking. - I have an idea! - Again? - I'm not going this way. - So what do we do? If we can't walk in, we go through the window. Tie the horse to this. Quick, do it. - What should I do with the horse? - What am I supposed to do with this? - It is far? - No, at the end of the street. Come on, go ahead. Do it. - Hurry up. - Hold on. - Come on! - Look, we're going up. - Good. - Yeah, perfect. - What's he doing? - Eat! Probably not hungry. Stupid horse. No! Turn around. - The other way! - U - turn! Yes, straight ahead. Rochefort, look. - The witch is here again. - We'll never get rid of her. - Rochefort. - It's starting again. - We're on the way to Bastille. -What are they doing there? -Catch them. I don't want to hear about them anymore. All right, sir. Hey you, come here. Take the ladder. Come with me. - Go there. - Climb. Do it, fast. Fast! - Perches poles. Right on time. - We're saved. Go on. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! Look, they're all crooked. You go that way. You go that way to them, from behind. It's going well, isn't it? Go up, fast. Faster, do it! - They're climbing the rope! - No! Hurry up. What are you waiting for? - Let's swing them a little. What's going on here? It's them again! Yes, but this time I swear to you, that I will rid you of them, Milady. Go this way. And you, help them! The others climb along the pilars. Finish them in 2 minutes or you will all go to the border crews. Kill them all! - Pull. - I'm pulling. - Weapons. - Oil. - And the flour! - Fast. - Take it all. - Let's go. - Over there, to the stairs. - Go to the other side. - Yeah, I'm going. I'm coming! - This way, please, sir. - No Please. More flour. Go up, go up. Go, climb up the pilars. Catch them! What are you two doing there? Hurry up or go to the Bastille. Damn, get out of there. Come on, damn it! - It hurts, doesn't it? - Yes Yes. - It hurts a lot, doesn't it? So, shall we reconcile? He's still angry. Bazin, come here. Grimaud! Watch out on the right! Catch! Fast! Damn you. I'll teach you what decency is. Come here! Come here to me! You won't run away from me. I will show you! - Hell! Let me remove the blindfold. - Did I hurt you? You too. Open up! - We're busy here. - Just wait! Ol?! Here you go. - Chandeliers! -Mousqueton, Bazin, bring the ammunitions Grab!. Here you go. What is this again? What is it? I asked you to climb up, not to come down. You are cowards. Scarecrows! If you were real men, you wouldn't slip! Get out of here! Here you go! Come back! Hit. Great! Here you go. Fast. Come on, come on. - A little pepper? - To give them good flavour. Catch. He sneezed. - Mousqueton, give me pepper. - Yes, here it is. Thank you. - Grimaud! - Yeah? - I'll take care of the horse. - Yeah, good. - Planchet, the horses are in the back, right?. - Yeah. Rochefort, go ahead! I think we're done. Look. More to the left. To the left! Next! Look. Watch out, I'm jumping! My horse has no head! Fast. Hurry up. Come on! I'll take care of them. I'll be right with you. - Bravo, Bazin. Hurry up. Stop, gentlemen. Sir, here are reinforcements! - A little late. - You are finally here. So what are you doing there? Climb up. Up! Bring me all of them. Gentlemen, up! Stairs to the right. Clean your shoes. Get up fast! Next! Come on, come on. Gentlemen, let's go. They won't come anymore. They will come, Your Majesty, they will come. Maybe a miracle will happen. Father Joseph, I have no news on Milady. It bothers me. Nothing more annoying, Eminence. A few minutes ago I was listening to the Queen. She doesn't have the necklace yet. And she won't have it. I firmly hope. Her Majesty the Queen is not here yet. Is she sick? Not at all. She'll be here shortly. - I told her to come on time. - And will she have her diamond necklace? Undoubtedly. I asked her myself. Your Majesty, I think now we will have to give up hope. Everything is lost. I'm disgraced. Hey, what do I do with it? What about me? - Quiet. - Quiet. After them! I saw the Queen. She has no necklace. The queen has arrived. She has no necklace. Here. Silence. Her Highness ... the Queen. Constance. - Too late. - Not too late. Come on, quick. You are beautiful, Madame. The necklace suits you. Thank you. What's the matter with you, Eminence? When I'm close to you, "Quand je suis tout pres de vous" My heart beats wildly "Mon coeur devient un peu fou" I admit. "Je vous l'avoue" As a miracle of love that night d'Artagnan sang beautifuly. Our brilliant ancestors, masters and squires ... ... created the first playback in history. Tell me "Dites-moi" When I see your eyes so sweet, "Quand je vois vos yeux si doux," Everything stops and I forget everything "Tout s'arr?te et j'oublie tout" I admit. "Je vous l'avoue" Tell me, if like me ... "Dites-moi, si comme moi" do you feel this sweet emotion? "vous sentez ce doux ?moi?" When your eyes from afar see me "Quand vos yeux de loin me voient" Tell me "dites-moi" These sweet words "Ces mots si doux" Are for you that my heart confesses "C'est ? vous que mon c?ur les avoue" Coming from you "Venant de vous" They make my heart go crazy "Ils font tout pour que mon c?ur soit fou" When I'm close to you, "Quand je suis tout pr?s de vous" I lose my mind. " Je suis sans dessus-dessous" I admit "Je vous l'avoue" Tell me, if like me. "Dites-moi, si comme moi" do you feel this sweet emotion? "vous sentez ce doux ?moi?... If you join me, yourself "Si vous m?lez vous et toi" Tell me "Dites-moi" - Hello. - Hello. - We'll tell you - the extraordinary adventures ... ... that happened to us. We're the squires of the four musketeers. - And thanks to our deeds ... - They are famous. But at the end of the battle, who raises his hand in triumph? - It's always the General. - And never the poor Soldier. If D'Artagnan, Porthos, Athos and Aramis ... Despite the efforts of the Cardinal are still alive and serve the king... ...to each one of us, they own their life. - D'Artagnan to Planchet - Porthos to Mousqueton - Aramis to Bazin - Athos to Grimaud END Translated from Czech and German; Lyrics " Dites-moi " from Internet, Soumar
