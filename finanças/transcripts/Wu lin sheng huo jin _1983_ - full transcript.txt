No I don't mind dying However... What about our child! It's too late to regret now Go How are you? Did they say where the Flame was?

He's from the west; he'd surely speak their language Our kung fu is still the best No matter how many tricks they have ...they can't beat us Brother Wan Miss Dao, are you all right? A while back I was scared to death Now it's like a circus Fortunately you're OK, otherwise... How could I have faced your father? You've saved me again My father must be very grateful There wouldn't be the opportunity What do you mean by that? Brother Wan, what's happened to my father? Your father... How is he? He's dead What? What did you use just now? So powerful! It's a family gift I hear there's a fantastical weapon ...called the Holy Flame Compared to yours which is more powerful? The Holy Flame naturally The best kung fu around... is prevalent in the eight clans Brother Wan you have such good skills Who's your teacher? He has long since retired And your teacher? He has resigned from worldly affairs Don't talk about him Farewell to you Goodbye Restrain your grief and accept the change. Let's go Where to? I promised your father I'll take care of you Really Miss Dao, I'm actually like you Very unfortunate, if you believe me I'll take you to the Sin Ha Alp Just the two of us?

Miss Dao, please take this in for me Don't come out for anything Go quickly Miss Yi, let me help you You are such a nuisance Still keeps blabbering! Thrash him Wait... you want to fight with me whereas I don't want to fight with you Miss Yi Be careful of the Golden Snake Boy I know Dan Fung Master What is Rule 101? Our disciples must not be promiscuous Remain chaste and avoid the opposite sex One who transgresses and jeopardizes our reputation ...will face disfigurement or death Really that serious! Bastard, you have lured my disciple here I'll kill you Then deal with this bitch Master, it's not his fault Brother Tien Sau Ghostly Laughter? Dan Fung, shut off your energy flow Good, Brother Tien Sau! Laugh this old hag to death Good... good! Continue laughing Don't harm Miss Yi, you hear? Don't you harm Ms Yi Good Brother Tien Sau, what's with you? Nothing I'll continue to laugh for you You're not up to it She's getting up again Laugh yourself! You had fun just now! Now I'll fix you Is the Phantom your Master? What if he is? Are you scared? What's your name? That's none of your business Let him go Did you hear me? Release him Master You... Bitch, what's this technique? This was taught to me by my master There're plenty more, dare to try? Don't be so proud of yourself Sooner or later I'll catch up with you Master... Come with me Miss Dao, this is Sin Ha Alp And your teacher? You wish to meet him, eh Good, I'll call him Teacher, I'm back A ghost! Not a ghost, it's me Look, it's here Tien Sau, you sure are resourceful Not only did you get the Holy Flame But you also brought back a great beauty Master, this is Miss Dao She has a pitiful background, so I brought her here ...not knowing if you'll keep her We could certainly use some extra domestic help Teacher is willing to let you stay But it'll be hard work I'll do anything Miss Dao, where are your parents? I did have parents But they were killed by the Blood Sucking Clan Luckily Tien Sau saved me Tien Sau, you did good Master, about my parents' murder It was Monster Yu's doing Also Er Mei's Jing Yin Er Mei's Jing Yin? What a nerve, to intrude Er Mei How are you connected to the Phantom? Last night I fought with the Grand Master Quite a fierce Kung Fu, I'd say She thwarted my Devil Sword technique And the Ghostly Laughter had little effect Then how did you escape? Strangely enough because of her finger Let me see See for yourself! This is rare Master, what is it? Her finger has absorbed snake bladder's blood And has acquired extraordinary inner powers No wonder I sent the old hag flying with my finger If I teach her to use her inner powers ...and create an energy flow, She might have greater powers than me one day Really? Tien Sau, there's only one month Before you'll come to a duel with your enemies The kung fu you've learnt is not good enough I'll teach you the Holy Flame tomorrow Yes, Teacher Grand Master of Er Mei is here Senior, why do you always like to... see my teacher at night? Am I that senior? I need to see your teacher urgently What are you doing here? You're so relaxed Disciples of the Phantom have shown up So what? I'll kill him That was nothing to be scared of initially But now a bloody tramp is helping him Even I was almost beaten by him That violent, huh! Who is it? Wan Tien Sau So it's Wan! His Creed is powerful You must have been hit What Creed? I heard it is a Creed in red colour On it is embedded a sphere A corpse was melted in the Blood Sucking Clan Haven't you heard? When I fought with him There wasn't such a weapon Do you know how he got it? Yes, he got it from the Moon Cavern Supposedly left by his father Left to him? Could be a family treasure? What is it anyway? It's the Yang Holy Flame! What? The Flame has Yin and Yang versions? I guess Guess? I'll return and preside at Er Mei You think of the deadly techniques I'll practise with you in a few days. Goodbye All of you retreat fifty steps. Don't venture... near the practice chamber without my instructions Yes, Master Dan Fung Yes, Master Having to face this wall for 3 days How do you feel? These 3 days I see women with eyes open And see women with eyes shut as well I realize now, women are the greatest You've appreciated the spirit of Er Mei Now, do you know why... I've locked you here? I've broken the rules, that's why I'm locked here Must be for a special reason Indeed a smart Er Mei student I'll show you something This is the much coveted... Holy Flame of the martial arts world Holy Flame? Miss Dao Show him the power What are you doing? Doesn't Wan have one too? Dan Fung, have you seen A Holy Flame just like this? Yes, Wan has one He fought with you at the inn a few days back Wan Tien Sau There're really two Holy Flames Wan Tien Sau is the son of Wan Ching Chung Had Dan Fung been aware of her past experience ...would have given me even more trouble Master, how did you come by this Holy Flame? Can you tell me please It's a painful story I'm afraid you might be hurt Why? Master Eighteen years ago To get the Creed of the Holy Flame The Phantom pursued and killed And your parents died at the Yu Fa Terrace The Monster wanted to eliminate you too Luckily I got there on time Defeated the Monster and saved you The Monster has not let this go And has arranged that eighteen years later We have a duel at the Yu Fa Terrace Master After I saved you, I found on you ...a Creed of the Holy Flame After much trouble I found the Holy Flame at the Happy Valley Teacher, why didn't you tell me earlier? I feared you'd be too eager to seek vengeance And leak out the secret of the Holy Flame Besides, the Holy Flame must be practised ...by an eighteen year-old virgin Next month is the fight with the Monster A decisive duel will ensue To seek vengeance for your parents And for Er Mei's reputation, you must... diligently practise the Holy Flame technique ...and defeat the Monster Yes, Teacher Invincible Legs Dragon and tiger technique Charging forward Wipe out all enemies Conquer heaven and earth Dan Fung, come here Yes What's the matter, Master? It's your good fortune, so look closely Only one chance Eyes rolled back, bone and groin sucked in Hardened limbs, power throughout Teacher, what does it all mean? These are technical terms for training ...and would only show up by blood from a virgin Master, it is gone That's natural as the spirit has passed You still haven't memorized the creed Yes I have Continue tomorrow Yes, Teacher The Mighty Finger has been successfully trained Juan Er Master Show me your skill Yes Teacher, are you satisfied? What a rare talent! Hard to come by What do you seven old guys want? You dare to intrude into Er Mei Smelly wench Wouldn't blame you if you don't know these 6, but... you don't know me either, Master of Wu Dang The way you speak... You disrespect the Cung Tung Clan What's the big deal about the School? Who doesn't know us Shaolin monks You don't even mention us Wa Shan Monks You don't give us face There is also the Miu Shan Clan What's the big deal... Don't quarrel... jeez, this noise is killing! Stop arguing You seven have intruded Er Mei What is it that you want? I decline your invitation Stop dreaming The Holy Flame ...has been seized by Er Mei's Jing Yin Nobody This Nobody, who is it? It says Nobody. How can we know? So you're blaming this on me In other words You deny possessing the Holy Flame So what if I do One can't harm you But seven of us can Want to fight You have forgotten my power It's turning Grab him Quickly... Who is it Who dares storm Er Mei I see each of you... standing like a log I just wanted to have fun with you Who's playing around? Grab him I'm through fooling around Don't let him get away, chase him... Master, they've turned a hundred times Why don't they make a move! They don't dare Teacher, look at the sweat It's becoming a river Yes! Let them clean it up later You... if you still hold on to the Holy Flame We'll... really beat you up Give it your best shot Charge Master What? C'mon speak What? Master... Master Totally useless I have no time today I'll settle the score with you another time She's gone Now what? After her! With the Holy Flame in my hands... I can dominate all and can do as I like Teacher, you are wise... to use the 7 grand masters to subdue the old hag Otherwise it would not be that easy Of course The Creed held by Wan; Is it like this one? Yes, but of different colour That must be the Yang Holy Flame then Let's get it back Teacher, Wan saved my life once It won't be a good thing to do Monster, not bad at all Of course Don't push her, lest she be angry If you don't give me back I'll kill you Jing Yin, because of this Holy Flame ...eighteen years ago I killed the Wans for you Now you want to seize the Holy Flame for yourself Are you shameless? It won't be given to you I was being merciful ...and saved Wan's daughter I found with her... The Creed of the Holy Flame That's how I came by the Holy Flame Who is Wan Ching Chung's daughter? My student Yi Dan Fung Why didn't you eliminate her, but instead... fostered her and taught her kung fu? I intend to play brother against sister ...to get rid of the Monster You're more treacherous than you look Never mind that. Hand it over No way Even if it were given to you... you'd have no use for it Why? Because this is the Yin Holy Flame The power within it can only... be harnessed by an 18 year-old virgin girl What about an 18-year old boy? He should learn the Yang Holy Flame! Monster If you give me the Holy Flame... I'll go and grab the Yang version with you And give it to your student Chase quickly... Chase quickly... Holy Flame? Jing Yin, surrender the Holy Flame Otherwise... speak We'll kill you together See for yourself, it's with him Don't say I took it from you It's here. Grab the Flame if you can Fight... Stand firm... Stand firm... Thank you I'm tired, how about you? Almost Fight! I'm very painful Me too Could we not fight? You're so gutless Forgive him if he surrenders No way Hey, my beard! Right on target Oh man, this time I'm done for! Master, the monk is dead Collect the corpse The Creed is yours You have no use for this Yin version Return it Not unless you exchange it with Yang version Come along. Let's go and get it together When? Day after tomorrow Tomorrow Good skill Finish it. Then you have to practise I know How's your breathing technique? Master said soon I could be like a bird Flying! Hero Wan, Miss Dao Oh it's you! Miss Yi Why have you come to the Alps? Because of the incident at the tavern My teacher kicked me out I have nowhere to go now Your teacher is a beast Yes! She's so wicked Why did you become her disciple? I have my reasons Let's hear them I'll tell them only to you Not to you Let's talk aside over there! Okay Don't you eavesdrop! Now you can tell me Miss Dao, I'm sorry I don't want to do this, But I... Sister, don't be so foolish When teacher returns... We'll plead to him to let you stay Then no one will bully you anymore She's so kind, how can I do it? What to do? Dan Fung, what are you waiting for? Jing Yin? Teacher Why have you disobeyed my orders to kill her? So you didn't want to commit suicide It was to kill me Kill her It was the Phantom who killed my parents Not Miss Dao, I... She's that demon's disciple She can't be spared either Kill her. Come on Brother Tien Sau Where is Miss Dao? She has died falling down the cliff What?! Brother Tien Sau Jing Yin, you've killed him Where should we go to seize the Holy Flame? Miss Dao You cannot confuse right and wrong Brother Wan, this is not my fault That's right! It's not his fault He was forced by his teacher Let her go at once Only if you surrender the Holy Flame If you don't, I'll kill her Don't give it up, without it You cannot avenge your parents Miss Dao Well? Give up the Holy Flame Surrender it All right, I'll get it Monster, he's getting the Yang version Guess you should return the Yin version to me Rest assured I'll keep my promise Give it to her Yes Dan Fung When your parents' murderers come ...follow the plan Yes, Master Brother Tien Sau, don't give it to him Here's the Flame. Release her No way. If I do, you'll be up to your tricks Master, trust him this once! If you don't let her go... we wouldn't get the Holy Flame Do you agree? Leave Hand that over to me Master has returned This is the guy who killed your parents Master, luckily you're back Yes, that old hag threw me down the cliff It is not yet the date of duel. Yet... you've already stormed the Alps. That's unfair This matter has to be settled sooner or later And the sooner the better All right, Tien Sau Those who killed your parents are here Take this opportunity to take revenge Dan Fung How did you get the Yin Holy Flame? It's my teacher... Stop talking and let's fight Hang on Miss, I have no quarrel with you Why're you after my life? Eighteen years ago at the Ju Fa Terrace... Dan Fung Jing Yin, let her speak Do you still remember Eighteen years ago at the Ju Fa Terrace... ...the poor couple who died? The couple who died eighteen years ago; Is she the daughter of Wan Ching Chung? Don't answer, lest you reply wrongly Teacher, let me speak You are tongue-tied because of guilt Miss, if you are Wan's daughter Then they are the ones who killed your parents Not me Dan Fung, don't listen to him He is the one who killed your parents What proof do you have? Wan Ching Chung hid the Yang Creed ...on his child And the Yin version on his daughter The Yin version you have... is the best proof Then, Master, she is my sister That should be correct Miss Yi, until this matter is clarified ...I hope you wouldn't fight All right, I promise you Useless bitch Monster, fight All right Teacher, what's with you? Go Chase Follow me C'mon hurry They've escaped Damn it! Miss Dao, close the door Master, please sit Master Master, how are you? Teacher, are you alright? I wouldn't die Little had I thought Jing Yin and the Monster In these eighteen years ...have improved their kung fu so much; They've even defeated my Ghostly Laugh Master According to what you say Tien Sau wouldn't be able to avenge his parents Not really. If only the Yin and Yang were joined Anything is possible But as Jing has the Yin version And my sister is fooled by them... into believing that teacher is the enemy; How can the Yin and Yang versions be joined? That's right, it's impossible The only hope is... for your sister to know who she really is Teacher Where's Teacher? Teacher's not here You can look for her in the tavern Right, how come you are here? Teacher has asked us to guard the Holy Flame From today, no disciple of ours is... allowed to enter except with Teacher's permission All who disobey will be executed Especially you Don't enter the chamber one step Or we'll deal stringently with you I don't believe this. I'll ask Master What's the big rush It's you again I have no time to fight with you today Miss Wan, please don't misunderstand I'm not here to fight I have something important to say to you Why do you call me "Miss Wan"? Because your surname is not Yi How do you know that? I also know who killed your parents The Phantom killed your parents The murderers of your parents... are Monster and Jing Yin, not me Who are the real killers? This is a sad story I could have brought witnesses, but the... 7 Grand Masters have been killed Say no more I did have doubts when last time at the Alps Didn't ever imagine that my teacher... Miss Wan, don't be grieved Rather think of a plan to avenge your parents Just tell me if you need help Right, since Teacher has not returned... I'll seize the Holy Flame, then seek my brother Okay, I'll help you Ji Fung, I hand this to you Traitor You rebel against us and conspire with outsiders ...to steal the Holy Flame When Teacher returns you'll killed Teacher killed my parents, so mind your business Want me to take the blame? Still not gone? Out of the way Teacher... Teacher, we're in trouble again Dan Fung took the Holy Flame She took the Holy Flame And said Teacher killed her parents. To seize... the Flame she conspired with Golden Snake Boy Damn it Jing Yin, what should we do about this? Speak no more, I have a plan You useless morons are to be blamed Teacher, have mercy on us Since you have to execute them... use the opportunity to try it our way Bone incineration by fire Good, let's try our power Don't kill me Escape quickly Mercy!... Teacher, aren't you a little too much? You dare talk back?
