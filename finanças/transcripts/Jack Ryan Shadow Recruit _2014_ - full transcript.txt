Sorokin wants to meet you now. Ten minutes. Yes, Minister. I warned them of the outcome at the U.N... it was entirely predictable. It was a mistake for us to force a vote. You started moving assets when the vote went against us, I hope? Yes, Minister. You understand the Kremlin must remain entirely distanced. Anything you activate must be self-contained. Is it the hour for 'Lamentations'? Lamentations? The Russian government is unaware... of any such activity or operation. But of course. (SECURITY SPEAKING RUSSIAN) The Kremlin. Yes, yes. We will avenge our mother Russia. You will avenge our family. America will bleed. Good luck, Aleksandr. Everyone is in place, sir, in America and in Moscow. Let it begin. He's dangerous. I lost him. ls everything in place? Yes, Mr. Cherevin, our asset in the U.S. has been contacted. He's prepared? Yes, sir. Merely awaiting your order. We will strike... tomorrow. Very well, sir. Sell orders have all been entered. It's time. We will activate our asset immediately. It was stupid to mention the job. A real mother would. It wasn't necessary. (PRIEST SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Today's reading is from the Book Of Lamentations... chapter 2, verse 2... Lamentations. We've been activated. Thank God. He has torn down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom... and its princes down to the ground in dishonor. The timing of the attack has been brought forward. We leave tonight. Take nothing with you. There is one loose end to tie up first. Seal the elevators. No one goes in or out. Find Cherevin now! Your wallet, let me see it. Have them followed. We are tracking them. The same old weaknesses, Viktor. Vodka, vanity, women. Your son would be ashamed. Ryan has it. The market has opened in New York, Mr. Cherevin. Margin calls from creditors are imminent. Do we sell? Not yet. We recommend immediate execution of sell orders. Wait. Trading is about to be suspended in New York. Mr. Cherevin, we need to act now. Please... Aleksandr. Sorokin wants to meet you now. It was always for Russia. So is this.
