MURTAUGH: Riggs, you sure we're on the right street? -Yeah. -Yeah? We must be getting warm. -You see anything? -Where? I don't see anything. This must be the place. Holy shit! What the hell is that? Jesus. Who's this joker? I don't know. A spokesman for the NRA. Regular asshole. What do we do now? Run him over. What if he shoots us with that rifle? -He hasn't yet. Maybe he won't. -What if he does? Don't be a Don't-Bee. Be a Do-Bee. Be positive. MURTAUGH: Positive? -Let's run him over. -Glad you see things my way. I hope he doesn't turn around. He won't. We'll creep up on him slow so he won't notice. Yeah. Okay. RIGGS: Will him not to turn. Power of positive thinking. Don't turn. Come on, will him with me. -Will him? -Don't turn around. -l need you, man. Don't turn around. MURTAUGH: Don't turn around. -Just believe. -Don't turn around! We're better than him. We're better! He's turning. I was wrong, l was wrong. Get down, get down. They just bounce right off him! I saw. We're in trouble, man! Shit. I'll draw his fire. You run for cover. No, I'll draw his fire. You run for cover. Are you out of your mind? You got a wife, kids. l got less to lose! -Hey, Riggs. -Get going, Rog. Get out of here! Riggs, l wasn't supposed to tell you this, but Lorna's pregnant. -You're gonna be a father. -Get going. Get-- What'd you say? You're gonna be a father! Riggs.... [GUNSHOTS] [SIREN WAILlNG lN DlSTANCE] She was afraid to tell you. She was afraid you'd get angry. You never talked about children? -Shit. -A baby. There's something l'm not supposed to tell you too. What? Rianne's pregnant. You're gonna be a grandfather. Rianne's what? But Rianne can't be pregnant. She's not married. Well, l don't think she intended to get that way. They asking me to be a granddaddy? Mm-hm. Yeah. [ON RADlO] --a fire In the hole Son of a-- [GUNSHOTS] Here's what we'll do. Take your clothes off. -What the hell for? -What for? -Yeah. -Okay, you run. Flame-O here turns, sees you in your undies. It distracts him, and that's when l shoot. -Shoot what? -The valve on that napalm tank! Before he shoots me? -Maybe. -Maybe? Is he black? Too much armor on. I can't tell! No! Not him! The father of the baby! -Okay. -Please let him be black! Fire in the hole RIGGS: Get going! Here he comes! Are those little hearts? Not now, Riggs. Just hit the damn valve! Okay. Also, flap your arms and make noises like a bird. Flap my arms? Why? It'll distract him more. -l need him to turn. -All right, all right. -On two! -We always go on three. No time for three. Go. Two! MURTAUGH: What about one? -Okay. One, two, get going! I don't want to die in my underwear! [MURTAUGH CLUCKlNG] Why are you waiting for? Shoot the bastard! Shoot him, shoot him! [SCREAMlNG] RIGGS: Incoming! Whew. Riggs, you think that bird thing helped? You think it helped? No, no, I just wanted to see if you'd do it. [RlGGS LAUGHING] Cute shorts. Go spit, Riggs! RIGGS: Come on, l'll buy you a doughnut. Don't put your arms around me when l'm naked. Well, surely you're ashamed of your butt. RIGGS: He's a lively one. MURTAUGH: That shark damages my new boat, l'll take it out on you, Leo. LEO: I didn't mean to catch it. RIGGS: What do you want to keep it for? MURTAUGH: Yeah, why keep a shark anyway? The teeth'll look great on a wall. -They gotta stop snapping first. LEO: Maybe he'll fall asleep. Go down, converse with him. He'll nod off. -He don't look tired. -Maybe chewing on Leo will wear him out. You think sharks eat their own kind? [RlGGS & MURTAUGH LAUGHING] Oh, stop it. You guys got me in stitches. [LAUGHlNG] Okay, where's my bag? Starboard side aft. Starboard, that's left, right? No, port's left. Starboard's right. -Yeah, right. -Yeah, right. Right, yeah. Right side aft. Got it! -Whatever. -Check both sides. You'll find it. Careful! He's behind you, shark! [RlGGS HUMS THEME FROM "JAWS"] Maybe we should throw him overboard. MURTAUGH: Throw them both overboard. Boy. RIGGS: No witnesses out here tonight. We'd probably get away with it. [MURTAUGH GROANS] You too? I kept my nose out of it... ...but you and Lorna. You're having a baby, you're living together. You're not getting married. Why, does that violate your family values system or something? No, I'm just trying to understand. Rianne's not married either. Okay, okay. That's hitting below the belt. You know, when l was married... ...it was good. You know. You put the ring on. You make the commitment. You do all the.... She's dead because l'm a cop. She's dead because l'm a cop and l.... I don't wear the ring anymore... ...but l look down, it's still there. I still feel it. And, l don't know, it's like I'm not finished with that yet. I don't know how to explain it. Is that bullshit? No. It's not finished. It's not finished. Yeah. Okay, you did say "aft"? A-F-T. Aft! That's a fucking word? In the back of the cabin on the right side, Leo! Why didn't you say that to begin with, Roger?! People get around boats and water, everything becomes fucking nautical! "Astern! Avast, you landlubbers! Man the bilge pump!" Pump your fucking ass! All right, all right, all right. Okay, okay, okay. No problem, no problem! What's Lorna say about this? She doesn't like nautical terms either. -Huh? -We haven't discussed it. That's pretty messed up. The baby's due in days and you guys haven't talked about getting married? No. I haven't done it at all. [GUN CLlCKS] Do we want Leo to shoot the shark? Do we want Leo to shoot--? Hey, hey! No, Leo! LEO: What? Hey, hey. -What's the big deal? -You're shooting a gun on my boat! I'm not shooting your boat, I'm shooting Jaws. Nobody's killing it. l'm not letting a good animal die so you can have its teeth. Sure getting grumpy since you found out you're gonna be a grandpa. RIGGS: Get off of me, will you? Don't fool around! This is some piece of hardware. You got a permit? -l'm a P.I. now. Of course l do. -A P what? A P.l., a gumshoe! You get in ugly situations. l got guns, everything. You are an ugly situation. Permit or no permit, you don't deserve this. You're not safe. [GUNSHOT] MURTAUGH: Smart move, Riggs. Shit! [GUNSHOTS] Hard right, Rog. LEO: They're gonna hit us. RIGGS: You hear shots? MURTAUGH: Coast Guard, this is Code 7. [MURTAUGH SPEAKING lNDISTINCTLY] We're in L.A. Harbor. Over. -We gotta go. Come on, Rog. MURTAUGH: Code 7. They're getting away! LEO: Who was it? Do we know? No, no, I'll drive! -Want me to help? -Get out of here! This your gun? Yeah, you want some laser surgery? Hey, hey! You could blind somebody! Coast Guard, this is Code 7, in pursuit of freighter. Heading north. Awaiting instructions. Over. MAN [OVER RADlO]: Code 7, this is U.S. Coast Guard. Maintain your present course. -We have a cutter en route. RIGGS: Why you slowing down? We'll hang here. Coast Guard'll be here soon. RIGGS: What do we do now? MURTAUGH: Show them our badges. LAPD! LAPD! RIGGS: Los Angeles Police Department! We heard gunfire! The Coast Guard's on the-- [SPEAKING IN CHlNESE] MURTAUGH: Coast Guard! Freighter's on fire! -Let's board them. -What are you talking about? Fire on the freighter! MURTAUGH: Okay, l'm upside. Now what do you do? They're getting away. Get me up there! [ALARM BEEPlNG] LEO: Hell of a fishing trip! MURTAUGH: Shut up and keep your head down! LAPD! LAPD! Stop where you are! Hold it right there! LEO: He's got it! He's got it! [RlGGS SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY] LEO: What'd he say? MURTAUGH: He said watch his back. Why didn't you tell me you were gonna shoot? Tie it up! What? Pull it up! That was great, wasn't it? I told you to keep the boat closer! [BOTH STAMMERlNG] What are you listening to Leo for? Oh, shit. You all right, Riggs? Wow. Look at that. Oh, shit. Jump! Jump! LEO: Where are you? My boat! My new boat! -Hey, Rog. -What? -The shark. -What about the shark? Oh, shark! LEO: Don't leave me! [GRUNTlNG] Come on, Leo! MURTAUGH: Hurry up! LEO: I'm coming! You can make it, Leo. This is all l got left. And since l met Riggs, I've had my house destroyed... [THUMP] ...my car wrecked and now my boat sunk. What's left? LEO: I think that's about it. MAN: Four sets of papers, totally genuine. They'll get in the country and they'll be able to stay forever. U.S. citizens. Ask them to vote the incumbent party next election. Help me keep my State Department job. Bloody marvelous! They've red-flagged the Asian visas lately. Those weren't so easy to slip through. [IN CHlNESE] Something wrong? [IN ENGLlSH] A small delivery problem, Mr. Proody. Goodbye. Leave! [IN CHlNESE] [TRAIN HORN BLOWlNG lN DlSTANCE] [BELL DINGlNG] [YELLS] [SCREAMS] Coast Guard interdicts about one of these a month. Pretty raggedy-looking. INS AGENT: Six weeks locked in a hole with one toilet. Rice and a little fish to eat. Lousy deal for 35 grand a head. Thirty-five grand. Where'd they get that kind of money? Didn't. Got to work it off from the snakeheads, the smugglers. -They sell them as cheap labor. -Sell them? Like slaves. I guess these must be the lucky ones. INS AGENT: They'll claim asylum. Say they were persecuted, like everybody else. We'll send them packing. Cost you and me a goddamn fortune. What happened to, "Bring me your tired, your poor... ...your wretched masses, yearning to be free"? Now it reads, "No vacancies." I guess your parents were Native Americans. They pop one every boatload. Shows the rest what'll happen if they run off or don't pay. At least he's nobody's slave now. Come on. Don't coddle them, move them! We're on the boat and I see this barrel coming down. Murtaugh didn't see it, so l push him out of the way. Big guy. l knock him over. We're in the water. I pull him because he doesn't swim good. I gotta save him. There's that kid. What's his name? Bissel? -lt's a food. -Burger! No, Biscuits or something. He's always kissing my ass, giving me coffee and shit. Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh. What are you doing here? -Hell, that's a long story. BUTTERS: Hey, man, you're all wet. -You need a blanket? MURTAUGH: No, I'm fine. -Somebody get this man a blanket now! WOMAN: Yes, sir! BUTTERS: All right. OFFlCER: Get this body out of here. BUTTERS: Hold up. What do we got here? Step back, step back. Shit. He's dead, man. He's fucking dead, man! -Shit! -What? This is how he wanted to come to America? Was he in the killing section? -This guy's been shot four times! -Well, yeah. At close range, like he was executed! -He was executed. -Yeah, by the crew. What the fuck, man? People get killed left, right and center in this town! Now we're importing victims? Gangbangers wanna kill each other, no problem. You and me, one of us gets shot, hey, occupational hazard. But just a normal guy, this fucking guy? What the fuck did he ever do to anybody? -That ain't right. -Easy, Biscuits. You'll get an ulcer like this, kid. Settle down. BUTTERS: Blanket! -Sorry, Blankets. -Here's your blanket. Sorry, l'm losing my head. I just hate to see bad things happen to good folk. We'd like to stick around and shoot the breeze, Butler, but you're in charge so-- You should take this, it's free. You're all wet. -Get some vapor rub on your chest. MURTAUGH: All right, Boogers. REPORTER: Sir, over here! -Hey, get them out of here! Get them out of here! Yeah, yeah. He takes the job kind of personally. Personally? Yeah, he's pretty serious, I'd say. Overzealous. -Emotionally-- -Jealous of who? -l don't know. Who? -You just said he was jealous. -l didn't-- -You just said-- No, I said he was zealous. Full of zeal. -He's loud too. -What? -He's loud! -What? We better get up before the sun's up. I got something in the lifeboat. That's okay, see you tomorrow. I'll catch a squad ride. Hey, Rog. I'm sorry about your boat. Riggs. -l'm sorry. -Shit. All of a sudden, this big fucking shark comes-- Can I say that? You can say it, but we can't air it. So this big darn shark comes along.... Shit. My Code 7. [PERSON COUGHlNG] -Hey! Hey. WOMAN: Hey. -You were coming home last night. -l know, l'm sorry. I had some bad Chinese. You look a little banged up. You look a little knocked up. [LORNA LAUGHS] -Are you okay? -Yeah. -You sure? -Yeah. Whoa. Easy, tiger! There he goes again. She. There she goes again. You okay? I'm good. I'm better than Roger. His boat sank. LORNA: No. Boat sank? -l had something to do with it. No! No grease! RIGGS: Have some cookies. -What happened? RIGGS: What happened? Gunfights, explosions, sharks. The usual. Here, boy. Oh. Thanks. You were out fishing. l mean, does trouble just go looking for you? Well, it seems to know pretty much where l am most of the time. You finished the nursery. Yeah, l did. I figured it was good for a girl or a boy. Cute, huh? RIGGS: lt's a dogfest. Did you get the whole 1 01 ? I know. I got a little carried away with puppies. Kid'll probably hate dogs. You know, Lorna, we never ever talked about marriage. Well, l sort of figured you didn't want that. You want to get married? Well, no. Me neither. You want some breakfast? Yeah. Yeah. Serve and Protect. Since when do you read this smut? -lt's not smut, it's Ebony Clark. -Ebony Clark. Trish gave it to me. "Every fiber in his being desired her. He devoured her with his eyes." Hey. Can we try this thing on page 1 96 sometime? Whew. There's a good one on 1 68. Maybe later. Nothing comes between a pregnant lady and a meal. Have l ever "made your womanhood reach peaks... ...that would rival the highest Himalayas"? -Foothills of Malibu, maybe. -Not even a Teton? -l don't think so. -Thanks. I thought I'd at least rate the Rockies. Well, you know l'm kidding. You're just saying that to make me feel better. No, I'm not. No, l'm not. You know I'm playing. I've been to plenty of mountaintops with you, Riggs. It's just that l'm hungry. When you have that kid, we'll blow up Mount Saint Helens. -l brought you a doughnut. -A doughnut. Police food. How did you know? I dropped by lnternal Affairs yesterday. Really? How's the rat squad? -l picked something up, good one. -Some cheese? Oh, yeah. I.A. got an anonymous tip. The person said Roger's on the take. No, he's not. I know he's not. It's probably some jerk he put away. But with the new boats and putting two kids through college... ...l thought you ought to know. I actually tried to persuade him to take money. Oh! Stop it, Riggs! I can't hear that! Nothing! I won't say anything anymore. I'm kidding. -That's awful. -l'm kidding. Don't tell him l said it. He's got enough problems... ...he'll blow his top, it'll be awful. Just don't say anything. What do you mean? Like what? -ln general, problems. -You mean something specific. I got a nose for these things. Come on, tell me. What? No, you know, you're pushing me. I don't want you to go there. Get it off your chest. You'll feel better. Tell me. I won't leave you alone till you tell me. LORNA: Son of a bitch. -Tell me. I'll tell you. Pregnancy destroyed my brain cells! I can't believe l said that! What? What? -l'm drooling. What? -Oh, Riggs. Okay. Promise me, swear to me that you'll never say a word about this ever. -l swear, I swear. -Right hand! I swear l won't, ever. I promise. What? You know how Roger is about his daughter dating cops. He'd kill them. So? Rianne married one, he's her baby's father. She's too afraid to tell Roger. They met, fell in love. She got pregnant, they got hitched. And nobody's telling Roger about this? After the baby's born, Riggs. You mean it's a package deal? Here it is, take it or leave it? Ha, ha, ha. -Does Trish know about this? -Yeah, she knows. She doesn't know you know. But Trish knows. Who's the lucky soon-to-be-dead son-in-law? Riggs. -Who? -Sergeant Lee Butters. Oh. Oh. This just gets better and better! No wonder he sucks up to Rog. Brings him apples, blankets, coffee.... Okay, okay. Not a word. I'm telling you, nothing. You kidding? l won't tell. He'd shoot me just for being the messenger. He's my best friend. lt'd be wrong to mess with him. I promise. I won't. Promise. LORNA: We don't have to discuss boys' names, period, because we're having a girl. Okay. Piadora. -l like Piadora. That's sweet. -Yeah? [KNOCKlNG] -Can't live with that. -l love that name. We're talking kids' names. Has Rianne picked any out? Need all the help we can get. We don't want to double up. Oscar for the boy, Loreen if it's a girl. I like Lee Butter. Better! l like it better. -Don't get me started. LORNA: I like those names. MURTAUGH: Captain wants to see us downtown. Trish'll be right down. Have fun shopping for the baby. RIGGS: Bye-bye, honey. -Yeah. Who had the sleepover? Just airing out camping gear. -We're out of here. -Wow. Something smells good. LORNA: Really good! Trish has food on the stove. We're out of here. That smells like Chinese food. MURTAUGH: Chinese food? She's into Chinese cooking. RIGGS: I gotta see this. Can l taste? -l love Chinese food. MURTAUGH: Hold it! Please, Lorna. Please. There's a Chinese person in the kitchen. I saw him. A couple of Chinese people. Actually a whole family. Large family. -Oh. Hey, guys! What's up? -Hey. -Hello. MURTAUGH: Yeah. -lt does smell good. -Great. -They were hiding in the lifeboat. -They were? MURTAUGH: With what the lNS guy said, I had to do something. -So you brought them home. -lt took two trips. -Really? -They fit in the station wagon? That's Ping with his grandfather, Hong. He's head of the family. Speaks pretty good English. Hong, this is my partner, Martin Riggs, and Lorna. Wife? No. Rog, can l speak to you? CARRlE: Lorna, this is the best breakfast. I'm hungry. l'd love some. Are you out of your mind? This is illegal. As in, "against the law." You'll bring a shitstorm down on you. Just hold on! Just wait a frigging minute! The way l see it, those are slave ships out there. And l'm freeing slaves, I'm freeing slaves... ...like no one did for my ancestors. Okay? Riggs, it's my chance to do something and do it right. Why didn't you say so? This is not gonna be boring. Need any help? Okay. Where is he? Hey, Daddy. What is it this time, food or money? -Food and money. -Money. I see you more than when you lived here. We're independent now. Okay, okay. What's the money for? -Hookers, drugs-- -Contraceptives. Can you believe they talk to their father like this? -Better than their parole officer. CARRlE: lt costs more to go to school now. Me first, me first. I get the tuition bills. And the grades too. Consider this a down payment on a future ass-chewing. Get out of here and go to school. I wanna see some grades. I see the tuition. I want to see some grades! I want more cluck for my buck. NICK: Thanks for the money. -Oh, boy. -l'm tired. Me, l can't win. Boy! Did we get a raise and nobody told me about it? Heh, heh. I got to get to the bank. How can you when you're taken to the cleaners all the time? Yeah. Hey, guys. -Hey, Trish. -Hey, babe. -Those the kids leaving? -Yes. And we're broke. Is Lorna here? Yeah. She's in the kitchen, probably on her third breakfast. I remember those days. -Oh, Martin, l'm sorry. -l love it when you do that. -You look terrific. -Thank you. Wait till she starts trying to raise that baby by herself. Daddy, l'll be fine. Move back in and Grandpa Rog will be up all night with the baby. Better than her marrying the wrong guy. Well, you know, a cop or something. True. Come on, guys. See you. -l should say goodbye. TRlSH: Hey, Lorna. MURTAUGH: Hurry up. RIGGS: Oh, yeah. Stuffing your face. Stop kissing me. Try that. You stay away from my girl. I'm not joking. Stay away from my girl. -Joking. -Bye! Got the baby beeper? RIGGS: Yeah. -l know. -lt's your fault. It's your fault. All the chicken shit. Flapping all over the place. All right, everybody! It's been a year almost already, okay? This shit ain't funny no more! -All right? Enough is enough! -Please! Enough. I'm the one that gets it in the neck. Can we exercise a little maturity around here? If l find who's doing this, I'll kick his ass. What asshole is doing this? Riggs, l catch that asshole who put my picture up, that's it! That's it. RIGGS: Cut their balls off. -Captain. Hey, captain. MURPHY: I look out expecting to see all the old faces. Instead, l see a bunch of kids whose names I barely remember. Will you sit down? We're dinosaurs headed for extinction. Speak for yourself. We're making way for the new police: Guys with guns and psychology degrees, like Butters out there. -Biter has a psychology degree? -More like a psycho degree. Hell, I got nothing against it. Times have got to change. I once got shot by a hot-rodder with a zip gun. That's how far back I go. You wanted to see us about something? Some things don't change. -Here we go. MURPHY: The department lost its insurance. All the damage you've done, they can't get a new one... ...while you two guys are still running around. They can't fire you either. So they're promoting you. -Heh. -Eh. -Lieutenant. MURPHY: There's no open lieutenant spots. So the chief used his special privilege, he's making you captains. -Better. -Captain. Time was when this would send me over the falls. I'm getting old. So, what the hell we do now? I don't know, captain shit. -Hang out. MURTAUGH: Take long lunches. Yell, "Riggs, Murtaugh, I'm the captain." MURTAUGH: "Chief's shitting bricks, man." -You finished? You finished? Think you can stay off the streets and out of trouble? Absolutely. -Captain Riggs. -Captain Murtaugh. [LAUGHlNG] RIGGS: All right, hey. -Hey, this is-- MURPHY: Hey. You want your badges? Let me see those sergeant badges. Give me those. -Throw them over here. RIGGS: Never liked it. -Here. -Give me those. This is one of the most painful fucking experiences of my life. -Now get out of here. -Thank you, captain. -Thank you, captain. -Thank you, captain. -Captain, after you. -After you, captain. Enough with the "captain" shit. Get out of here. After you, captain, l insist! "O Captain! My Captain!" -Captains outrageous! -News travels fast. Get a break from real police work. Play golf, tennis.... [SINGlNG] They got brown rings ALL: Around their noses Now that you're captains, come up in the chopper for a ride. -Not for me. RIGGS: l'll take a rain check. -lf you change your mind, call us. -He's down-to-earth kind of guy. Aw. I'm sorry. Can we knock this shit off, please? This is your captain speaking. -Can we knock it off, please? Okay? -Jesus. The man's got feelings, you know? [PEOPLE LAUGHlNG] BUTTERS: Hey, congratulations. Look at you. Captain Murtaugh. I don't really know how to say this, but you really inspire me. Keep it up. RIGGS: How's it going, Burton? -lt's Butters, captain. -Yeah. I'll remember that. -Kid really likes you. -l wish he'd cut that shit out. He likes me? -Likes me? -What? No. You don't think he likes me, likes me, likes me... -...likes me like that? -Oh. This is not the military, it's the police force. The millennium's creeping up on us. The captain said, "New people, new department." -Dr. Woods? WOODS: Yes. Oh. Captain Riggs. -Don't run. -l'm in a rush. -l need to talk to you. -Do you? Ah. What is it this time? Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs? -Or did you cook up something new? -l'm sorry about all that. I wanted your advice. I was thinking of-- -Thinking? -Marriage. [LAUGHS] Marriage? The "M" word? Does "confidentiality" mean anything to you? That's funny. You know what would happen? We'd go in my office... -...and you know what you'd tell me? -What? You'd tell me something like, "Doc... ...l want to marry Murtaugh." Or your mother maybe. Or how about Nelson Mandela? Nelson Mandela? Something to ridicule me, Riggs. Something to get a rise out of me. Listen carefully. I'm not stupid. And my time is reserved... ...for police officers with real needs and real problems. Have you got that? -Have you? -Run it by me again? No. And you know what? I don't like you. RIGGS: Stephanie? I can't go out with you. I'm in a relationship. l'm very happy. I think you need to see someone. You'll find someone someday who'll love you. Not in this department. But stop bothering me! WOODS: You're disgusting! What's the matter with you people? What's shaking? -Captain Riggs. -Captain Murtaugh. You're supposed to turn around and do that. We're captains. Heard you were up to your ass in Chinese. The taller ones come up to the navel. They were short, but big enough to kick your ass. What can l do for you? One of the ship's crew shot one of the illegals, apparently under orders... ...and we'd dearly like to know who's smuggling Chinese these days. We got no hard evidence, but we're pretty sure the big boss is Benny Chan. MURTAUGH: Uncle Benny? -You know him? RIGGS: Yeah. -Back when he was running smack. -We never nailed him either. Benny's slippery. Where's he hanging out these days? He's got a nightclub, couple restaurants. He operates mainly out on North Broadway. Here's the address. -Hi, fellas. MAN: Riggs. There he is. Hey, Burger! Uh, Summers. BUTTERS: Butters. What you got on the freighter homicide? I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals. They only knew the shooter by sight. Checked out the boat. Turns out the boat's registered under a dummy corporation out of Indonesia. It'll be a rough one to crack, but we'll nail them. You ever hear of Benny Chan? Benny Chan. No. What kind of bad man is he? Real bad. Big crime boss in Chinatown. If it's dirty and Chinese, Benny's doing it. Where do l find him? At this restaurant. I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog. How about you? Since we're going there anyway, we'll drive you. Chinese? Let me get my jacket. -Riggs, not with him. -The kid's doing a good job. We might need backup. Spend time with him. You might learn to love him. Like a son. -A son? -ln law... ...enforcement it pays to know your fellow officer. He might have to back you up one day. [MURTAUGH CLEARS THROAT] Sir, let me just say, it'll be an honor to share some egg rolls with you. Yeah, all right. Let's go. Share? Butters, it seems like you hate crime in a sort of personal way. -lf you don't mind me saying so. -Why do you say that, sir? It's just last night I noticed you were more than slightly miffed. -Wasn't he, Roger? -Yeah, yeah. Any particular reason? About 1 50,000 of them. That's how many bullets zinged around my neighborhood growing up. Couldn't go outside. Couldn't go near a window. Lived on the floor, ate on the floor, slept and watched TV on the floor. I didn't learn how to walk till l was 1 0 years old. Spent most of my formative years nose-to-nose with the family beagle. When I work on a crime, I ain't thinking about the crime. I'm just thinking about that goddamn floor, and it pisses me off. Hey. -We supposed to meet Leo somewhere? -No, why? Because he's following us. Don't look too hard.

RIGGS: We gotta go, Rog. -Take care of yourself. RIGGS: Where're we going? NG: L.A. Harbor. RIGGS: What's there? NG: lt's what they call a foreign trade zone. There are a lot of shady deals going down with the Chinese military. It's run by a corrupt Chinese general. MURTAUGH: I got it. Some corrupt Chinese general brought the Four Fathers here... ...and the Triad's buying their release. BUTTERS: That's what Uncle Benny meant by buying them back. RIGGS: That general's gonna shit kittens when he sees the money's counterfeit. MURTAUGH: Yeah. Let's tell him. [SPEAKING IN CHlNESE] [CAR HORN HONKlNG] Hi, gang. L.A.P.D. I saw Hong. This is what Benny meant by buying the Four Fathers back. Look, it's Harpo, Groucho, Chico and Fucko. How are you, boys? Who's the naughty general? Who's been lining his pockets? Naughty. Speaky English? [IN ENGLlSH] What do you want? See all this? I hope you need a lot of toilet paper back home. That's about all it's good for, wiping your ass. Take the Four Pops back to China. We don't give a shit. RIGGS: Heh, heh. The Four Pops. Heh. We don't want them no more. It's counterfeit. See? Triads never prosper when they try cheating a general. See for yourself. RIGGS: There you go. Money losing face. General losing face. Hard when Triad try to sit on it. I fucked you. I fucked you. -We fucked you. lt's beautiful. -lt's beautiful. RIGGS: Don't we get a hand? Here we go. [MACHlNE GUN FIRING] RIGGS: Keep your head down. Let them shoot each other! Riggs, watch out! Thanks! [GUNFlRE] [GUNSHOTS] Was this a good idea? It was an idea! [GRUNTlNG] Eleven in the mag, one in the pipe. You? A real gun. Six shots. Four! -Hey, Rog? -Yeah? What's going on?' Why are you lying to me? [BULLETS WHlZZING] I.A. says you're on the take. I'm on the take? I think it's crazy too. But you're spending lots of money. You ever hear of Ebony Clark? Yeah. She writes those cheesy sex novels! -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Are you boinking her? No, I'm not boinking Ebony Clark. -Trish is Ebony Clark. -Trish is Ebony.... You are boinking her. Yeah, l'm boinking her. [GRUNTlNG] -Too embarrassing to tell anybody. -Yeah, I don't blame you. -She's making a shitload of money. -How many you got? -Uh, two. -All right. I'll look for more ammo. [GUNSHOTS] Who's the guy with the white pajamas? That's Wah Sing Ku. The Four Father with him is his older brother. No kidding? [GUNFlRE lN DISTANCE] BUTTERS: Get down! -Hey, Butters. -Shit! Shit! Now you got my name right. I'm out. I got to find some rounds. I'll help you. Never been shot before. Hey, hey, Ng. Take care of my son-in-law here. [GRUNTlNG] [GRUNTS] [GUN CLlCKS] Hey, Riggs! -You all right? -No, I got my ass kicked again. Shit, I'm out. l'm out. I hit the son of a bitch. I thought I missed him. Where'd they go? Come on, come on. We got door number one, number two, or number three. -Looks like number two, Monty. -Let's go. What do we got behind door number two? Bingo. [GASPlNG] Now you've done it. Now he's really pissed. Son of a bitch gonna be a handful. Since I met you, l've done some hairy shit. But this is not gonna happen. I'm gonna be a grandfather... ...and you and Lorna gonna have a baby. [THUNDER RUMBLlNG] He ain't worth dying for, Riggs. He ain't worth it. Yeah, you're right. If he gets away we can track him down later on... ...with a howitzer or something. Your son-in-law's in there, bleeding. We should get him, get the hell out of here. -Shit, it's raining. -l'm too old for this shit too. MURTAUGH: Guy's too damn good. Yeah, he's damn good. How'd he do that thing with the gun? He took my gun apart with one deft move. How'd he do that? Huh? How? Yeah, okay. Let's go ask him. [GRUNTlNG] RIGGS: You mother-- [GROANING] [RlGGS YELLS] [GROANING] [YELLING] [YELLS] Rog! Are you up there? Are you all right? Rog! Riggs! Hey, Riggs! Riggs! Where are you, Riggs? Will it to me, Riggs! Riggs! Where are you, Riggs? Will it to me, Riggs! Will me, Riggs. Will me.

[RlGGS GASPlNG] You willed me to it, man. You willed me, baby. What took you so long? What took me so long? What the hell do you mean? I was knocked down over here. I couldn't even get up. [MURTAUGH CHUCKLlNG] Hey, hey! Come back here. Let's go home, man. Let's get out of here. I haven't been here enough lately, Vicky. l'm sorry. I need to talk to you about Lorna. Me and Lorna. It's like this. She wants to get married... ...and l love her. I won't lie to you. I do. And l want to make her happy. I'm looking for help here, honey. I don't know what to do. Funny talking to you about this stuff-- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG] -Oh, Leo. -Hey, Riggs. You want to get yourself shot, is that it? What the hell are you doing here? I was tailing you. Sorry. I'll leave you alone. I guess you want to be alone. -Yeah. I'd appreciate it. -Okay. When I was a kid l had a pet frog. What? Just give me a second. Let me tell you this, okay? I had this pet frog, name was Froggy. He was my best friend in the world. I didn't have a lot of friends. Matter of fact... ...l had no friends. I used to kiss the frog too. I thought maybe... ...it would turn into a princess since I was a boy. And it could be... ...my mother. They told me that she left or something. And my father was no bargain. And so, just the frog... ...Froggy, was my friend. I really loved him and took him everywhere with me. I was riding my bike one day... ...and he jumped out of the box... ...and l ran him over with the back tire. I killed him. I was really heartbroken. Really. He was my best friend in the whole world, the only thing I ever loved. And then I met you... ...and Roger. You guys really looked after me a lot more than you had to. I'm terrible to you, Leo. No, it's okay. It's okay. You're my family... ...and my friends. You're not better friends than Froggy, you're just different. And l just thought that maybe that might be relevant. Okay, l'll leave you alone now. Leo.... I got a funny f-- Oh. -What's the matter? -Oh. I'm having a baby. -What? -lt's Lorna. She beeped me. Yep, it's Lorna. She's having the baby. -Holy shit. I'll get the car. -l'll be two steps behind you. You sure picked a strange angel, honey. [CHUCKLES] But l got the message. I got the message. I'll always have this. Always have you. In here and here. Thanks, honey. I gotta go. Bye. I am not ready to have this baby! NURSE: You're as ready as you're going to be. Fine! Just wheel me in. My legs are staying closed! Give me this! Ma'am, let go. I am a police officer. And l am not ready. I am L.A.P.D. and l can arrest you for interfering.... Lorna, are you all right? NURSE: Are you the husband? -Yes. Honey, are you all right? No, I'm not, Riggs. I said l didn't wanna get married, but I do. I want to be a wife before I'm a mother. And l lied. -l know you don't want to. -Okay. -You said "okay"? -Yes, I did. Okay. Let's do it. Okay. -He said okay. -Yes. WOMAN: Congratulations. -He said okay, Leo. Oh, my God. What's that smell? I was on my way to the toilet and she grabbed me. -l'm so sorry. -Have a nice baby. I'm so sorry. Will you marry me? Oh, Riggs. -You bet I will, Riggs. -Okay. Let's go. I'm not going. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Please, Riggs. -Get a minister. -Now? Now. Because we're getting married. Here comes another one. -We need a license, blood test-- -l wanna hear the words... -...before the baby comes. -lt's coming now. Listen, l am getting married or there is no baby. This could be an aspect of a transition phase. This is no goddamn aspect of a goddamn transition phase! Honey, everybody, calm down. Calm down. Okay? -Get a priest, minister, anything. -Where? Go get a priest! Goddamn it, Leo! I got it, I got it. Okay. RIGGS: Pant, pant, blow. Remember Lamaze class? Pant, blow. Pant, pant, blow. [RlGGS & LORNA PANTlNG] -But l want to say "I do." RIGGS: Hey, look. Here he is. This is Rabbi Gelb. -A rabbi? -You said anything. No, no, no. He'll do. For what I'll do? What's going on? We'd like you to marry us. Please. -You're Jewish? -Not necessarily. -You got a license? -No. -Well.... -Please don't go. She needs to hear the words before the baby comes. Are you both serious? I don't have time for hijinks. Real serious, rabbi. We're very serious. I could do it. It wouldn't be official. It's all right. I just want to hear the words. What the hell. What are your names? I'm Martin and this is Lorna. Martin and Lorna. [SPEAKING IN HEBREW] What am I doing? How do the goyim do this? -Dearly beloved. -That's it. Dearly beloved.... Dearly beloved, marriage is a spiritual union.... Oh, Rabbi. NURSE: Faster, faster. She's heading for the home stretch. Martin, will you take Lorna to be your wife? Will you honor, love, et cetera... -...till death do you part? -l will. Lorna, will you take Martin to be your husband, et cetera? -Yes, I do. GELB: The same thing. All right. I pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. You already did. -Let's go. -No, wait, wait, wait. RIGGS: What? What? LEO: Hold it, hold it, hold it. -What is it? LEO: Let me have this glass. I need this! No, goddamn it! What the hell are you doing? Aah! Talk to the hand, okay? I'll be right back. Wait, wait. You know how long it took me to fill that thing? All day! This is unsanitary. What is this? -Break the glass. -l'll get piss on my shoes. -You gotta do this! -Okay. Mazeltov. Hey! What the hell? Come back here, you little son of a bitch! Pant, pant, blow. Leo, please. Your work is over here. I think someone else needs you. -Okay. -Okay? Good luck, Lorna, Riggs. -Leo? -Yeah. -Thanks a lot. -Oh, okay. Stick around. Meet the kid. Good luck, Lorna! Okay, okay. Riggs. LEO: Here it comes, here it comes. Here he is. LEO: He's looking right at you. He knows it's you. Rog, look what l found. -Look at that. -Oh, boy. What a beauty. Look at those eyes. -He looks like his mother. -Yes, he does. Murtaugh, Murtaugh, Murtaugh! No, Butters! Butters' baby. Better not be Murtaugh. MURTAUGH: It's Butters. BUTTERS: Look at that baby. RIGGS: Look at the hair. Oh, that's my baby. MURTAUGH: Look at her. You're so cute. Look at you. Twenty-seven people, nobody thought of bringing a camera? Leo, your plastic's flaccid. Face it. These machines wreck your plastic, then give you the camera. The camera doesn't work. They're trying to-- -No, no, no. -Leo. Okay. Hey, captain, what are you doing here? Look at these two babies. A little something from everybody at the squad. MURTAUGH: All right. RIGGS: Thank you. -Those captain badges, give them back. -What for? Congratulations, you're sergeants again. The city's self-insured. RIGGS: l thought they were gonna make us president. By the way, Grandpa, you owe the chief one. He went to bat for you with the lNS... ...and they're gonna give asylum to the Hongs. All right, all right. We're gonna take a picture. Come on. Come on. LEO: All right. Squeeze together. Candy stripers out. Out. Okay, okay. Out, out. I can't. There's not enough room. l'm sorry. -You gotta back up. -Back, Leo. I'm taking big steps! Get this guy to take it. Leo, get in the picture.
