Oh, what the fuck? What the fuck is this shit? You've got to be fucking kidding me! Help! Somebody help! Fuck you! Help! Help! Have a look. Evening, Mr. Kellum. I have a package in the back. Fetch it for me. This way, sir. What the bloody hell are they doing? Having a barbecue or something? Find anything? No. There's no other way into the place. Over there. Yes sir. Mr. Kellum? Send him in. Will there be anything else, Mr. Kellum? - Privacy. - Yes, sir. Kellum. Frederick Kellum. Such a pleasure to meet you. Ah, yes. Allow me to introduce my other guest to you. It's okay. There, there. Shh. Hey. It's okay. I won't hurt you. Not anymore. No! No! No! No! Goodbye. Goodbye. She's all yours. - Hey, boys. - Ma'am, you're supposed to park the van around back. Can I get one of you guys to help me out? Van, around back! Please? Just a second. What is this? Don't think so, mate. Oh, my. That smells... wonderful. Don't move. Good lad. Sir, I need you to turn around and leave the premises, please. - Sir, I need you to leave. - Come on. Have a drink. I need you to leave, sir! Get out. Now. All right. - Get down! Get the fuck down! - Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh! In you go, with your other friends. Don't move, okay? I'm serious. Where the fuck are you, Kyle? You have no idea how long it's been since my last meal. Oh, God! You're an artist. Beautiful. Get down. Don't fucking move. - Is it clear? - Yeah. Go. Back. Back! Put 'em down. Where is she? Where is she? Mickey! Mickey? What the fuck? Oh, shit. Kyle, are you okay? Yeah. I'm all right. Mickey? Hey. She gonna be okay? - Hey. Mickey. - Hmm? Is she gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah, she'll be... She'll be fine, mate. - You ever seen her like that? - Sorry? Have you ever seen her like that before? No. No, afraid not. How long y'all known each other? Quite a while. Six or seven years, I think. Sweet girl, really. I know you don't get to see that side to her much, but... she is, I promise. - She's just been through a lot. - Like tonight? Yeah. Too many nights like that, I'm afraid. I think she's getting worn out from it all. Can't say I blame her. Doesn't it get to you? Oh, yeah, it does. But I just look at things differently. How so, if you don't mind me asking? No worries. See, I knew when we went looking for that girl, that when we found her, she wasn't going to be alive. And I know that. You know, I... It still hurts to a degree, but I'm just... I'm just ready for it when it comes, you know? She saved me. - I don't think I ever told you that. - No. That's actually how we met. I was kidnapped, and she rescued me. - You serious? - Oh, yeah. Awful, awful situation. Were you scared? Yeah, I was scared. Bastard tied me to a chair. I was about to be fed to his pit bulls. Pissed my pants. Anyway, things are so different now, and... that's why we don't have a dog. Anyway, that's a... that's a story for another time. So where to now? Now we're gonna go and see Deloris. - Mickey's mother? - Foster mother. Now, don't forget that, or she'll remind you in painful detail, believe me. Anyway, I'm, uh, turning in for the night. Just stay on this road. In a few hours, one of us will take over. She's sleeping. Is that them? Yes, Mama. Hello, dear. Charles. Deloris, I'd like you to meet our friend Kyle. - He's working with us now. - Hi there, ma'am. Don't crowd me, boy! Okay. Where are you, Michelle? I'm here. Well, take my hand! No. We just came to give you these and say goodbye. - Goodbye? - There's really nothing else to say. You ungrateful little wretch! Just stop. Do you want to see them or not? Tell me you found her. What was left of her. You failed again? - Failed? - Yes, failed! I gave you everything you needed to find her, to save her, and after all I give, you do nothing! You withered old hag, you have no idea what happened. And you have no idea what they went through, you little bitch! But I do, because God shows me everything. God doesn't show you anything. You're just a freak. Blasphemy! Oh, give me a break. You don't even care about them. You're so selfish! You don't think I tried? Tried? Of course you tried. But you haven't saved one... not one of the lives God asked you to! I'm done. Done? Done? You never even got started. Can you see me, old woman? What are you talking about? - You can't, can you? - You know she can't. Shut up. Do you want to know why you can't see me? Death is closing your eyes. Soon you won't see anything. Not even your visions. All you'll see is the cold, dark loneliness of the grave. And honestly, you'd better hope there's no God. Thanks, Mom. All right. go on. I'll get you in the... - Mommy, help. - Danny, I'll be right there. Mommy! Tina, what are you doing here? It's Mom. She had another attack, and she's not doing good. She... She won't even talk to me. - She says won't talk to anybody but you. - I don't... She said it has to be you! Please! Hang on a minute. That you? I'm here. You came. Please, take my hand. Another vision. Why tell me? I thought I was a failure. This is different. Like I believe you. - You have to believe me! - Why? This is... this is the blackest soul I've ever encountered. He's killed more by himself and his things than nearly all of them combined. Blacker than yours? Damn it, girl, stop it! I don't have time for this. I don't have time for your feelings, and neither do they! I didn't ask for these visions. I didn't want them! They're a curse! A torment! A torment from God made to put you and I to work! You dragged me into this. Oh, you could've walked away anytime you wanted! Could I? Oh, spare me your bullshit. I at least know everything I am. A part of you knows you just love this. You've got nothing else! Not love. And if I have nothing else, it's because the woman that was supposed to have raised me never let me believe there wasanything else. A woman and her son, taken! - Th... They're still alive. - Don't. Do you want to know what will happen to that little boy before he kills them? Do you think he'll end up in a pedophile dungeon? It's worse. Oh, God, it's worse. Fredrick Kellum used this man. He brought that girl to him. You know, the one that ended up being barbecued? He's brought many victims to a terrible end, or else he's handed them over to butchers! I want to save them. Save them before they fall under the knife. Oh, God! This isn't about you and me! Please save them! I need you. Oh, God, I need you. There's nothing on here about a mother and son being kidnapped. Are you sure she's not wrong? Deloris is never wrong about this kind of thing. Who is he on the phone with? Who is he on the phone with, Mickey? One of our connections. Connections? We have connections? Who? The F.B.I. I thought you said we were supposed to stay away from cops. - We are. - Could you explain yourself, Mickey? I'm getting really tired of this "leave the new guy hanging" rookie bullshit. Deloris was part of a special team before she went solo. The F.B.I. had a program in the late '60s. Funded a lot of psych research. Deloris was called in on several major investigations. Like what? I never heard too much about it from her. I know the program shut down. The lead agent in charge, he retired, started his own private intelligence organization. Mom never told me any of that. She didn't tell you a lot of things. Well, why and how is this gonna help us? We're hoping that someone they're affiliated with has a backlog of the 911 calls in South Carolina. We don't even know where we're looking. Yeah, but there couldn't have been too many mother-and-son kidnappings in the last 24 hours. If it was outside a residence, then somebody might've spotted it. So if she's right, and we find this place, what then? That's where you come in. They're gonna call us back. We can at least start heading towards the Carolinas. Get off the counter. He's gonna be back any fucking minute. I know it. - Calm down! - Shut up! It's my fucking turn. - Calm down! - Any fucking minute. Okay? It's my fucking turn. Hey. Hey, are you awake? Shh! Settle down. Shh! Stop! Stop! Stop it! My son! Where's... God, where's my son? - Shut up! - They took my son. It's okay. What's your name? It's Brooke. But they took my son. - Where is... - Shut the fuck up! Shh! Brooke, you have got to listen to me. Where is he? Oh, fuck! - Oh, fuck! - Shh! Shh! Don't say anything! Fuck! Listen, man! Fuck! You don't want to fucking do this! Please! Fuck. Fuck. Please, please... Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Get off! - Is this the place? - Yeah, this is it. Doesn't seem like anybody's home. Well, let's go. Anything? No. That didn't seem entirely truthful. No, it didn't. - Well, Tina? - "Well" what? Don't bullshit me. What do you see? I don't see anything! You little snot! What do you want from me? I didn't ask to be a part of this. - Nobody made you come. - Like I had a choice! Get some, uh... Get some from the sides and around there as well. - They usually like this? - Yeah. Yeah, they're like this a lot. Really, really boring after a while. Being in that Winnebago, all you hear is, "wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah," you know? Drives me mad. God, you're turning into her! Don't play that "wounded little girl" shit with me. Whatever, Mickey. You don't know what it's been like living with her since you left. Damn it, I don't want to be here either, but there are people's lives at stake. Do you understand that? Who the hell are y'all, and what are you doing here? Come on. - Are you with the police? - No, we're more, uh, federal... federal agents. - I tried calling you! - Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but you probably called the police. We're federal agents, so... it's different. My daughter's missin'! Do you not get that? My daughter is missin'! Let me tell you this now. Your mother doesn't have long. When she goes, what are you gonna do then, huh? If you can't be of any use to us, we'll drop you off at the nearest bus station. You can figure out your own damn life from there. I don't have time for this shit. And that woman and son, they don't have time for it either. Mickey, wait. I don't want to find them. - You what? - ...information, that's all. And if there's anything you can tell us, that would be... that would be great, you know? I don't want to find them. - The mother and son? - Yes! - You don't want to help them? - No, I just... You're afraid. You should be too! What do you see? I don't... Don't what? He took her. Who are they? Uh, they're our colleagues. - Fellow detectives. - Fellow detectives, yeah. Who? Who took her? That man. They took her! They took her right over there! Who the hell are y'all? Uh... I want to see your ID's. Okay, that's our cue. Let's go. Who are you? You're not the police! - What do you see? What else do you see? - Mickey, time to go. Oh, God! Oh, God! What have you done with my daughter? Quickly. What else do you see? There was a woman. He was screaming. They hit her head on the van right over there. Mickey, now. Come on. Okay. Let's go. Great. All that woman has to say now... her daughter and grandson were kidnapped by four people in a Winnebago. - We won't be able to get anywhere. - Just go, fast. The Country Squire is hardly the most inconspicuous of vehicles. Federal agent? Well, better than MI6, I thought. Did she get the photos? Uh-huh. And what'd the doctor say? No. Thank you. Deloris? I don't think she's gonna be with us on this one. Dead? She had another attack. - An attack? - It's from the visions. The more intense ones make her heart beat too fast. So what do we do now? Go with Tina? How is she? Asleep. Let her sleep. We're gonna be asking a lot of her when she gets up. Like she's gonna be any use. You know, we've been driving around on a hunch all day for nothing. You got a better idea? Yeah. Yeah, I got a better idea. Fuck that. I'm going for a bite. All right? You hungry? No, you go on. So how'd you get into all this, Mickey? You've been waiting a while to ask me that, haven't you? - You don't have to. I just... - That's all right. My real parents died when I was four. I bounced around foster home to foster home until... Deloris took me in. That was my 12th birthday. What was that like? Well, Tina was just a baby then. Deloris had married this private detective. A real asshole, and a drunk. They were hunters then like we are now. Doesn't sound like fun. No. It wasn't. I was never really a daughter to them. I was more like the help. Tina's Father, Deloris's husband, was killed on a hunt when I was 15. How'd it happen? I wasn't there. All I remember was... Deloris's reaction. After that, Tina got what was left of the tenderness. I got the anger and bitterness. So why didn't you just leave? I tried, several times. Whenever I ran, she'd track me down, tell me she needed me. After a while, I just accepted it. How? How would you accept something like that? I don't know. I don't know anymore. There's just so much... pain in this job. Few tangible rewards. Look at me go on. That's the most you've ever said in the whole time I've known you. Well, now you know why I don't talk about it. You've got a lot weighing on you. More than I thought. It's no way to live. It's no way to live, Mickey. It's not. It's not a life, but... I've never had one of those. - Where are you going? - I just need a walk. Can I get you something, sugar? - Uh, just a water. - Sure thing. Are you mad at me? No, I'm not mad. You are mad. Well, what happens next? Let's say we find this mother and son. You know, alive if we're lucky, barbecued if we're not. Then what? Just call it a day? "Jolly good show, everyone. Don't let the camper door hit you on the ass on the way out." You've been drinking too much. Have I? Have I? Have you... Have you even thought about what would happen if you give this all up? Yes. I've thought about it. And? And I have no idea. I have no idea where I'd go. - You bastard! - Brooke, don't! What have you done with my son, you piece of shit? Where is he? I swear to God if you have hurt him I'll kill you myself! No! No! Stop! Fuck you! No! No! She gonna be of any use, do you think? I hope she'll come through. I have a question for you. Does it matter to you if we save them, this... this mother and her son? Does it to you? Yeah. It should. But we haven't saved much of anyone in a while, have we? You know, I just realized recently that... you know, we're not here to save anybody. I mean... of course, we try, and we should, but it's not like we have much to say on the matter, is it. We don't. So, it's not really much for them. It's... for those that might become the next victims if we let these bastards keep going. And the others just.... You know, we're no rescuers, Mickey. We just take out the trash when we can. I'm sorry, Charles. What for? For you feeling that way... and for it being true. You know, I've got... something to tell you, and I know this is... not the most appropriate place, but... Okay. I've been thinking about this for a long time, and... I know you might not want to hear it, but... I have to tell you before... this is all over and... Excuse me, hon. Is that y'all's friend out there? Oh, God. Shit. Tina, are you okay? He was here! - What? - Him, the man, the one you're looking for. He was here! She just woke up, started screaming and crying. What do you mean, he was here? When was he here? Where? Here, in this place. I see him everywhere. He comes here all the time. - Are you sure? - Yes! He comes here. He drives right by in his van, and nobody ever knows. He has bodies in the back, and nobody ever knows. Would make sense. Right next to one of the biggest highways in the state. Practically right off the exit. If he comes here often, he could live nearby. I could see if somebody knows him. You said you know where, what he looks like? Yes. He's tall and big. What else? He has long hair and tattoos down his left arm. Anything else? We need to know where he is! I know, damn it! I don't know where he lives! Of all the places, in the state we happen upon the one joint he comes to. What do you want to do? We got to go looking for them. You mean right now? We don't know how much time they have, Charles. Lady at the bar says she's seen him. Comes here maybe once or twice a week. She hasn't seen him in a few days. Kyle, you got to get a car. Take some of the cash. See if you can borrow the bartender's truck or something. All right. What are you thinking? I'm thinking if he lives nearby, we need to split up. What are we supposed to do? Just drive around aimlessly? You know, looking for a black van with horns, driven by a large, tattooed man? Yes, but not you. What, you want me to stay here? Tina, I need you to come with me. I don't want to go with you! Please, you don't know what he's like. You don't know what he does. Please! You don't have to go near him. I just need you to come with me to see if you can help me find him. Okay? Okay? Okay. Carol? Carol? Goddamn it! I don't want to be here! Just let me out of here! Oh, God! No! No, no, no! Don't! Please! - What about Deloris? - I'm gonna keep trying her. This is not smart, Mickey, and you know it... splitting the team up. We should stick together. We got lucky with this place. Let's not risk everything. You want to miss him coming here? No. This is just a scouting trip. If you see him, don't make a move. But if we find him, we'll come back and get you before we do anything. Okay. Tell Kyle to cover East of the highway. We're headed this way. Be careful. You too. See you later. All right. Take care. Behave. Is everything all right, friend? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Hey, uh, thanks for letting us use your truck. That was most kind of you. Thank you. Well, your friend offered me a really nice price, and Lord knows I could use the money. Good deal for you, then. No! Can I get you a drink? Yes. Yes, please. That'd be great. Okay. Coming right up. - Here you are, hon. - Thanks, love. Cheers. What? What? No, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! No! No. No. God! No! Please! Let me go! Don't you touch her! What are you doing? Stay away from her! Don't you touch her! Carol, it's gonna be okay! It's okay, Carol! Don't! Don't touch her! No! No! Stop! You son of a bitch! What are you doing? You stay away from her! Carol! Carol, look at me! Carol, look at me! It's gonna be okay. God, Carol! Carol! Look at me, Carol. - Carol! No! - No. Please stop. - What are you doing? What's he gonna do? - You son of a bitch! I can't breathe. It's gonna be okay! It's okay, Carol. Don't! Oh, God, Carol! Oh, God! No! God, Carol. Just breathe. It's okay. Stop! Stop! No! God, no! No! No! No! Stop it! No! You son of a bitch! - No! - My God! Carol. Good night, sweetheart. It's gonna be okay. Just look at me. - Just look at me. It's okay. - Oh, God! Please! No! Please, Carol. No. Rise and shine, sweetie. It's okay. It's okay. Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Shh. Shh. There. Okay. You're okay. You know what? It's okay. So, what we're gonna do here is, we're gonna sit and wait for my boyfriend to come back down. He's upstairs getting something. Where'd you say it was again, puddin'? It's on the counter by the woodblock, honey. He always forgets where we keep it. - You okay, honey? - Uh-huh. Oh. Where are my manners? Would you like a piece? Gum. Would you like a gumball? I take that as a no. You know, nobody ever says yes. I guess gum isn't exactly what you're looking for in a situation like this, is it? You know, when I was a boy... ...my parents took me with them to go car shopping. One of those big ol' lots full of cars... and trucks... vans. Balloons! I started wondering around while my parents were talking to the damn salesman. Of course, I got lost. Running all over that place, screaming, "Mommy! Mommy!" Started running down them rows of cars. No, vans. Excuse me. Rows of big ol' vans, way over my head. And as I'm running in between 'em, I'm heading towards a busy highway on the other side. Like a chicken with its head cut off. Not even thinkin'. Just trying to find my head. My mommy. Anyway, while I was running down that row, I slipped on a cracked gumball. Skinned my knees. But that gumball saved my life, you know? See, there was a truck came whipping down the other side of the road just after I fell. Would've splattered my brains flatter than this. Sure as shit. It was fate! And I believe that. Just like it was fate that brought you and your friends to our fine establishment here tonight. Of all the bars in town that you could've stopped at, sweetheart, you stopped at ours. And of all the people you could've been looking for, turns out it's a friend of ours. Well, it's an acquaintance, really, but... somebody that we have a vested interest in. - My goodness. He's trying to escape. - Go help him, honey. Oh, my. Oh, my heaven. - I got it. - Help him there, hon. - Wait, now. - There you go. Now you can see. Calm down. There we go. Now, you see, my point is, you're the one that's running down them rows of cars and trucks, looking for something. But you ain't gonna trip over no gumball. You ain't gonna save yourself. No. My friend, today... you're gonna get hit by one heck of a big truck. The man you're looking for has three very peculiar little pets. They're not really little. Maybe not little. but aside from his woman, we're the only ones privileged enough to work with them. There he is. You see, we have an arrangement. His little pets have a real appetite for folks just like you. And so every now and then, we supply him with a good meal, and we get to watch. It's not really personal. So, I'm gonna spare you this, at least. Let me see. Mickey? Yeah? What are we gonna do when we find him? We're gonna find that woman and her son. But what about him? What are we gonna do about him and his things? What things? Damn it, Tina, if you know something... I don't! Shit. - Whoo! It's hot! - All right, all right. Quit, now! Go around back. I'm sorry, sugar, but we're closed right now. Is there something I can help you with? You shot my leg, you bitch! You bitch! I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Charles? Fuck you! Where's Charles? - Who? - Stop right there! Hold up, bitch! Real slow like. Now, hand that gun over to her! Do it or I'll shoot her. I'm sorry! Mickey! - Please! - Shut up. - I swear I'll shoot her. - Oh, God! Just do it, bitch! Do it! - Please! - Do it you cunting bitch! Do it! Do it you bitch! Oh no! No! No! No! No, please! Please, no! No! Is this the place? The van's not here yet, but the lights have been on in several rooms since I've been here. - Have you seen him yet? - No. But someone's in there. Let's go. Be careful. No! No! Hello? Hello? Hello? If there's anyone in there, we're here to help. Hello, hello! I'm here! I'm in here! Shut up. Is there anyone else in there with you? No. Please! I'm alone. Please just get me out of here! Hey, listen, you've got to stay quiet. Please! They have my son! They have my boy. Look, we're gonna help you, but you have got to stay quiet. - Where's your son? - I think he's in the house. - Please help us. They've got him. - Get her out of here. Where are you going? You're going to... Just get her out of here! - Hang on. - Please hurry! I'm gonna get you out of there. Shit! Please hurry up! Please! Thank God! Thank God! I'll kill him! I'll fucking rip his face off! I'll kill him! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm going to kill him! I'll rip his little fucking face off! I'll do it! Put the gun down! Do it! Don't you dare hurt him. Put it down! Kick it over here. Thanks. Danny! Oh, my God, Danny! Thank God! Oh, my God, are you okay? Are you okay? Did they hurt you, baby? Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God. That's him! It's him. Oh, God! Kyle, get her out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, Danny. - Thank you. - Go! But... Get out of here! - Thank you. - Let's go, let's go. Listen, go to the end of the orchard. You'll see a van at the top of the hill. - No, you can't... - Get out of here. Go! Go! You got to go back! Go! Fuck! Let him go! Let him go, you motherfucker! Let him go! I'll fucking light 'em! Fuck you! Let him go! Let him go! Kyle! Let him... Let him go. Let him go! Let him go, or I'll fucking roast them. Don't! - Let him go! - N-No! Stop! Stop! Just do it, Tina! Stop! No! Stop! Stop! Kyle? Kyle! Kyle, get up! God, Kyle! Hey! Tina, go get the car. Tina, go. We need to get him to a hospital. Go! They ask questions at hospitals. We'll tell them it was a dog. A real, mean fucking Chihuahua.
