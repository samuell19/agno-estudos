Hey, you! Don't disrespect our graves. Now, if you look closely, you'll see that I have no spirit connection to this bottle. There is a spirit in this room. What is classified as a paranormal activity. Now, this is what scared everyone off campus because they believe that spirits are evil. Do you see? It's just floating there. It's not flying into the wall or trying to kill me. It's just floating there. See, this is how most paranormal active works. It's harmless. The government knows this, but I don't know why they're not telling us. Now, all I know is that what is dead or what's dead are no different from what is alive. Those who are alive are good, and those who are dead are good, too. I believe that once you are dead, there is a moment of clarity where you can see all areas in your life. Who's there? I'm here for you. Look, asshole, I can't help you if you're choking me. Now, I know you did not just slap me. Let me go. You are doing no good. Let me go. You made me have to do this. I call you back. If you're trying to get a message to a loved one, this is not [inaudible] the best [inaudible].. I cast you back. I cast you back. I command you. Go back if you want my help. Bye, spirit. But you should leave students alone, and I will help you. Now, that's it, guys. As you all see, that ghost is not harmless. He picked me up and threw me against the wall, and that's as easy as he could have picked up a sharp object and killed me. Now, thank you for watching my podcast. This is your girl, the ghost talker. Peace and blessings. Girl, where you at? I'm not going to leave. I'm still here. You were in the closet? At least I didn't leave this time. You thought a ghost was going to get to you? You're funny. But much has happened on the scanners. What do you think it is? Another African burial ground? I doubt it. Those spirits [inaudible] pissed off. They're trying to tell us something. What if it was a girl who got her heartbroken, and she killed herself from the heartbreak? You must be a writer, or you have been reading too many of them urban fictions instead of reading schoolbooks. You read books about dead people. Yeah, but my major is African history. Yo, did that ghost slap you? Because if it did, your audience is going to love that. I don't know what you're talking about, but what you heard behind the closet was a spirit for real trying to tell me something. Just wait until I figure out how to communicate with them. Well, I think slapping someone across the face conveys a pretty clear message. I don't know what slap you're talking about. Hi. Welcome. How you doing? Great. I got this genie, but I'm just trying to sell it. I see you guys have some things around here. I heard this genie bottle really works. I'm just trying to get a couple of bucks for it. Unfortunately, we do not buy that. We buy comics, toys, the occasional statue, but that, unfortunately, we will not purchase. But it's actually real. A real genie comes out and everything. I don't doubt it, but, unfortunately, store policy permits me from buying that. Well, honestly, I really don't want this thing. I'll just leave it here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? You're coming with me. Just get up. Why am I being arrested? Young man, that's all going to be explained to you downtown, all right? Take him away. Get him out of here. Watch your head. Get the hell in there and shut up. How you doing today? Good. Just that? Just this today. How much? $19.99 Very nice lamp. You want it, it's yours. How much for it. Take it. Someone left it here. Thanks. Thank you. Welcome to another "Hotep TV" podcast. Hotep to all my conscious brothers and sisters out there. I have two very special guests today. Our brother in the world would be called... In the Western world would be called a paranormalist, right? But we in the conscious community understand him to be someone who has learned how to use his mind in ways the Western world or Western science doesn't know about. His name is the third eye doctor. Hotep, Doc. Peace. Wisdom. Hotep. Tonight, I want to talk to you about ghosts, and sisters, and brothers who have made their transitions. I want our viewers to be able to ask questions, and I personally believe our ancestors are getting a bad rap. They call our sisters' and brothers' spirits the dead. Speak on how messed up that is. Well, my brother, you are so correct. When a person dies, the physical body goes back to the Earth from which it came, and the spiritual consciousness joins the universe. Really? Then tell me, is there any facts that prove this? Because in my class, I have to give my students evidence. Sure, my brother. There is evidence all around us. We have out-of-body experiences all the time. We just don't recognize it. Here's a good test of what's in the back of dead. The body of a dying man on the scale and weighed him before he died. And when he died, they weighed him again. Really? I think I heard about that. Well, according to the scale, the body decreased and decreased in weight, and science doesn't account for the spirit. And it had no explanation. However, to a spiritualist, it made perfect sense. Black-tastic. You hear that? You all hear me tell you that, but now, you're hearing it from a person who specializes it. Now, doctor, please, I have to ask you. You hear about the students that got killed in the African burial ground that we named Sankofa Park? That was tragic. They were too young to transition. Well, you heard the stories that the students told that survived? You know what they said? About the spirit called Baba? Yes. This Baba. But we don't mention his name on campus. One of my students is doing a paper on spiritual energy, and the title of the work is Understanding Spirits. She says she believes, and she wants to prove that ghosts are good. What do you think about that? She's on the right path. Spirits are a lot of things. She just needs to be careful. Think of the night sky. You look up, and you see thousands of planets and stars. Well, the spiritual world, it's the same way. She needs to be careful she doesn't meet a spirit from another planet or plane, as we like to call them. I'll tell her. I hope she's listening, though. So now, let me open up the phone lines and take some calls. Hello, caller? Who we got somebody. Hello, caller? What's in you, little bottle? I smell some smoke [inaudible] Like a vacuum or something? Let me rub it a little bit. The hell was that? What the hell. Let's see what you got. Let me rub that. It's got an engine or a motor in here or something. I thought I heard something. Oh, snap. Please. I mean no harm. Greetings. I'm at your service. What? Why, I'm here to make your wildest dreams come true. I must be bugging. What's in this beer? I'll show you I'm real. I'm like a guardian angel of your future. I'm here to make all your dreams and wishes come true. Are you like some type of genie in a bottle or something? Exactly. I have served people through many centuries, and now, I'm here in your service. Surely, you need something? I see you do not have a girl here, and you seem to be alone on such a beautiful evening. Is there something wrong with the men of this time? Look at the mess this place is. Did you lose your way with women? What you talking about? I'm a brother pimp [inaudible]. We get all the ladies. Yes. That is why you have a book of a woman but no women. Unless you're gay, which, if that's the case, I apologize. I can bring you men. I'm not gay. So would you like me to bring you a woman to service your needs? What? My needs? Wait, you can do that? Yes. I can do that and more. I can make all of your fantasies come true. I can't believe this. How are you going to get me a girl? You need not worry, my new master. You just sit here, relax, and I will return here with the woman of your dreams. Just wait here? Bring back a piece or something, too? What I got to say? Abracadabra? Your wish will be granted, master. Hand me the tape, Janice. No problem, sister. We want everyone to know about the missing girl in this city. The way it looks, we're seeing it on deaf ears. Everybody on this campus only cares about themselves. Well, I hope you're wrong. Hopefully, someone sees these pictures and recognizes the girl. We can't be everywhere, you know? Just because you don't like women doesn't mean you can't help us find them. We're putting up a Christmas tree for Jesus. No one good while they living in sin. If they were good Christians, they'd be helping us do God's work and helping us find the maniac. Did you hear that, Rose? Hey, Zawari. Hey, rose petals. Hold up. I know y'all don't think because y'all a lady of ice, you can get to the pearly gates? You think they'll be there without us? No, I don't think so. So you think because we don't like girls, we wouldn't be interested in finding a missing girl? How about, we do care? Yeah, we do care. Boy, you lying. This is real. They have two girls snatched up near this campus. So you better be careful walking around here looking like one. You might get mistaken. Well, that's too late. They caught your killer yesterday. What are you talking about? The boy at the store? You can believe that if you want. Ain't no bodies been found. Girl, please. This ain't no Hollywood movie. This is the real world. Yeah, like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." You think they're going to find the killer, but not the bodies? Please. So if you think they didn't catch the killer, you not scared? You think you can protect yourself? I will protect myself just like how you're going to protect yourself. I have a boyfriend on the football team that protects me. And so do I. My boyfriend plays defense. Hey. Hey. Why are y'all always fighting? Ain't gay guys and divas supposed to be best friends? Hey, Laquisha. Hey, Joy. How's the ghost theory coming along? I was just talking to one of your boyfriends. You be killing them. Because they can talk to the spirit in the dorm room. But just like we thought, it was a lost spirit. Well, it's useless finding a serial killer ghost. We need your help finding the missing girl. Well, there's a ghost in the park. How mysterious. Take a few flyers. I'll announce it at the Kwanzaa. Y'all are coming, right? We'll be there. I thought you said you was coming to our gay Christmas play? Excuse me? Who said we can't do both? I mean, there aren't a lot of people staying on campus for winter break this year. Hey. What you mean, hey? I found this in Dr Bryant's office. It was developed by Benjamin Banneker. Everyone thinks he's just a naturalist. He was the designer of Washington, DC, and he wrote the Almanac. What else did he do? And what is this? He was able to communicate with ancestors. I made this based off his design, and he was able to communicate with the dead. An Egyptian Ouija board? Pretty much, but I don't think they really used it that much in ancient Egypt. Well, what do you want me to do? I want to try to talk to Baba. Baba? The killer from Sankofa Park? Yes. I don't think that's a good idea. Girls are missing. What if he saw them doing it? I don't think so. He could have killed everyone at the cemetery that night. I just think he's misunderstood. Look, I know this is your thing and all, and I'm not going to hate on you for it. But if you get me killed, I'm killing you in the afterlife. Now after I put my hands on this board, what do I do? Why are you looking at me? You're the one who created the death board. Baba, Baba, Baba. I know you're in the spirit world. My name is Nzinga, and I want to talk to you. That's good. Keep going. I want to help you. I know that you're not evil or a monster. Come and talk to me. I want to understand you. Maybe I can help you. He spelled no. I know not all spirits are bad. He said, park. Do you want us to go to Sankofa Park? I think he's done with us. No, he's just beginning. This is our first breakthrough. We have to go to the park. Well, thank you, Mr. Genie. Are you satisfied, my master? Satisfied? You asked me that question right now? You just brought me a whole girl. I am at your service. Please, indulge yourself. I will return when you are finished with her. How did you find her? I chose a girl based on the women celebrated in this time of humanity. Next time, you're my homie. If that is your desire. So the guy says, that a genie made him kill the fucking girl. You believe this shit? Huh? A genie? Yeah, a genie. Man, that guy is a crackpot. Well, I'm sure he got some other bodies attached to him, so we have to find a way to connect this to that. He's a rapist. It's the easiest thing to go out and get a woman, to get a girl, and you got some man trying to overpower a woman with his force. Yeah, look, that shit burns me up. I'm sorry. You were saying? No, no, no. It's all right. It's all right. I like to know how my partner feels about these subject matters, you understand? No, I don't feel too good about it. I'm going to tell you right about now. This is what I need to know. If you're going to have my back, I need... I'm going to have your back. We need to know exactly how each other feel about this bullshit. All right? That's why I'm here to tell you I don't care what this guy got to say. You got to get his ass. We're going to get his ass. Don't worry about this guy. It's going to be all right. Listen, apparently, the kids were talking about some kind of situation that happened. You remember that case with the kids where they got killed in the park? Those other college kids? Yeah, yeah. It's called the... Hold on, hold on. It's called something like the death pledge? Death pledge. That's what it was. That's what it was. So apparently, the eyewitness testimony, the survivor said, there was a monster. A monster that came out and killed the kids. Monster? A monster. The death pledge monster? The death pledge monster. But it's whatever. We heard that story. Because the girl who was actually there... With this current case, the girl who was actually there, she said that she saw the kid the same night that we picked up this other kid. So it's got to be this dude, this fucking rapist guy. It's got to be him. It's got to be him, but you don't believe that, do you? These pledges always getting hurt and killed anyway when they join some form of organization in college. They're like college games. So you mean to tell me, to me, your partner, that I got a partner sitting in this vehicle that believes in ghosts? The fuck? The death pledge monster? Did I say that? I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I said, I don't believe. You know what? At least I don't believe in the death pledge monster. Listen, I just had... we just had this conversation. I was just about to get some respect for you. Now you going left on me and shit. Man, the Black nun, the Mexican nun. She got stuck at the border. Which part do you believe? I don't believe none of it. You are talking about this bullshit like the Earth is flat and some shit, OK? Please. Look, we're going to take the focus back, and we just got to get this guy. That's all I know. As long as we're on the same page about this particular suspect. If we're on the same page, we're all right. But if you start that other shit with the Black nun, and the Baba, and all this other kind of shit? I'm done. You're right. I'm going to feed off the facts. Feed off the facts. I'm with you on that. That's why you're my partner. When you said, you got my back, you got my back. Basically straighten me out. Even if the world is round. Man, this school's go no budget. They didn't even need those [inaudible] What's going on? Strange. My master needs girls. Get out of me! What the hell [inaudible]. A penis! This isn't a woman! Girl, I can't imagine what happened to those girls. I couldn't be nobody's sex slave. F that. For real. That's worse than death. Follow me on this, though. So I took this martial arts class because I was afraid of getting raped. My father made me take one of those before he let me live on campus. So you got me. So what's the first thing they ask... or they tell you, rather, in one of those classes? This can't save you from everything? Exactly. Remember that book I showed you that I got in high school? The hip hop guide to dating? So, well, that book helped me more than knowing how to flip somebody over my shoulder. You got that book now? Yeah. I keep it in my book bag. Let me just... here you go. Maybe we can read it to the girls when we get back to school. Yeah. How about this? Turn to the player hating list. There you go. And let me know how you feel about it. I'm going to use the bathroom. Where's the bathroom? Oh my gosh, where's the bathroom? What is happening? Where's the bathroom? Janice? Who's there? I'm not going to lie, if you don't answer, I'm going to beat your ass. All right, stop playing. OK. OK. I'm not doing this. So you think just because you can turn on some water, it's supposed to scare me or something? I don't got time for this. I got [inaudible] Run, girl! Run! Come with me. Get back! Get away from me! My master needs you. Dr. Bryant did say, that they did not put Baba's grave on the map with the other ancestors. I personally think that's foul. Why not put him on the map? Yes, it's like they were scared of him. So I'm not crazy for thinking that he got a raw deal. They did say he was falsely accused. That's what the story says that the writers did back in those days. Yes, it's like we're actually falsely accusing him again. I want to change that. He is our ancestor. What about the pledgees? I don't know. I can't say if they're lying. He probably did kill them. It's for the mosquitoes. Baba. Baba, where are you? I am here at your request. I would like to talk to you. Please show yourself. Baba, you told me to come here. I am here, and I would like to talk. Show yourself. Baba, I am going to leave if you don't show yourself now. Now, I will show you my world. I was fighting out of this horrible place. Everything people were in. No, no, no, no, no. And I will free. In my world where I'm from, Nana was going. My future hope did give you two. Baba punished forever. No, you're not. I want to help you. You cannot help Baba. I can. Just let me try. No! You can't. Baba is doomed. I am being punished. Yes, Baba. I can help. Please let me try. Go! Go! You must go now! Baba, talk to me more. Leave me alone. No, Baba. Let me help. Where do I find you when we need to talk? Well, let's start this presentation explaining what Kwanzaa is. Yes. We'll be lighting these candles, and with that being said, we are supporting everyone's play. Well, then, we'll be explaining what Kwanzaa is. The Fellowship of Nigeria was founded in 1999. It was open to both male and female. It was founded under the African principles and virtue, diligence, and humanities. Our mission is to build the African family through a commitment to spirituality and community. Kwanzaaa is not Black Christmas. It is the end of the year activity that brings us closer to our communities before jumping into the New Year. Yes. It uses the seven principles of Nguzo Saba. First one, Umoja, unity. The second one, Kujichagulia, is self-determination. The third one, Ujima, collective work and responsibility. Then following Ujamaa, cooperative economics. Number six, which is my favorite, Kuumba, creativity, and lastly, Imani, which is faith. We light these candles on each day to show or to discuss how we manifest through these principles. Well, sister, Alpha Sigma girls aren't here yet. Kareem, are you going to the [inaudible] presentation? No. The brothers of princess always do something. You got your power pledge? Well, since I'm the only brother up here, I didn't feel like I can make anything. So I just can't show my support. You couldn't get a girl to do it? I guess not. Well, we'll have the Hey brothers come up here and do their presentation. We invite you here today because we live in the same place. We didn't get to go home, so I think it's the perfect time to get to know each other. We are all members of the ETA [inaudible] fraternity. We're known as Hey. Hey was founded in 1987. It was in Atlanta. This is not only for straight people. Christmas is for everybody. Gays, les, anybody. So I wanted to throw this play... Not play, more of a speaking to you. To have I can show you how Baba is nothing. It's just imagination. See? What's there to be afraid of? Boo! What is there to be afraid of? We have baby Jesus, our three Gods. What else can we do? Now, I'm glad to see this. This is a Christmas about laughing, being in love with each other. It doesn't matter about if you're gay, or if you're... You only like boys. I only like girls. No, it's for everyone. Who cares if I'm gay? Thank you. I love how you're embracing a gay Christmas and all, but why do you got to make Baba a theme? Millicent is missing. I think the ghost from the park took her. Baba wouldn't do that. Honestly, that's crazy. I don't know about no monsters, but last night? Something happened. You sure she's missing? Yes. We were in the room together, and then she left. And I haven't heard from her since, and I've looked everywhere. I think we need to call... Let's call the police. I'll go look for her on campus. We'll stay back. We'll go, too. I know you don't think Baba's responsible. No. Not at all. He told me his whole story, and I've been in front of a few spirits. And his spirit has been the most comforting feeling. Well, good, because the way they described him, he is way too big for us to mess with. Yeah, that's it, but he's also gentle. I'm all set. Can you go turn off the lights, and we can go see if we could have Baba come talk to us? Whoa. I just thought about, what if we're wrong? Are you scared to die? Yeah. Don't be. Baba, we need you. Hear our call. We need your help. Baba, please come. Baba, I only want to talk to you. I understand you. I know your pain. Baba, please come to us. Baba, please come. We need you. You need to remember Baba's pain. Baba? Baba? Has too much pain. Baba, we need your help. I cannot help. I am dead. We are missing girls. I have not taken any girls. Can you help us find them? Are they with you? There are girls hurt. Yes? I see girls. Yes? There is a bad energy around them. They are scared of Baba. I do not hurt them. Baba, what's going on? There is evil in here. I can feel it. Baba. I must go. Baba has to leave. Too much evil. It will hurt you. I'm bringing a special podcast tonight to call your attention to a student that is missing. Yes. She was last seen on campus. Now, there are not a lot of students on campus staying over the winter break, so it's odd. I thought they caught the man who was kid... who's been kidnapped women already? Yes, they did. But, remember, he claimed he didn't do it. He said that a ghost or something had made him do it. Now, people are saying that it's Baba from Sankofa Park. That's making his return. That's interesting. Is there any sign of the paranormal activity? Usually, if one person sees the spirit, the other people will start to see strange things. My student, Nzinga, is trying to be a spiritualist, and she's been saying that she can talk to spirits. She's even made an Egyptian Ouija board. Things do exist. I just hope she's careful. Careful? Can you elaborate? What do you mean by that? A spiritualist or a medium is a conduit, or psychic, or ghost whisperer, or even a palm reader. Whatever name mankind gives them, we are all nothing but vehicles, roadways, HDMI cables. We're just the open doors between the other world and this world. Yo, that's crazy. No, it's far from crazy. It's real, and it's dangerous. You said, dangerous twice. What are some of the dangers? Well, you see, the spirits who wish to communicate with us have been waiting for a while. We've lost our ability to communicate, and there's only a few people that know how to give them a voice. And now, again, there's other cultures with a person in each tribe for this type of communication. So when a spirit crossed over and wanted to say something to somebody, there was a person that could help them talk. Interesting. So I can imagine, there's a lot of spirits waiting. You have no idea. Some of them get very emotional. That's the danger. Open up a line of communication without guidance? You have no idea what spirit you're letting use you. Wow. So I talked to you about giving us a demonstration or something? I'm prepared to do that. This allows me to focus my third eye. Now, are we near the campus? Listen, children. You are in danger. Who is speaking to us? Tell us. This is Mother Flossy. There is a demonic spirit near you that's close to making its return. You must not let it complete its cycle. It's feeding off the souls of young girls. Mother Flossy, how do we prevent its return? Destroy its conduit. Is this demon called Baba? No. Something else. It takes no name. Please, I must go. This vessel is getting weak. Thank you, Mother Flossy. Thank you. Do as I say, or you will suffer a fate worse than a transition. Doctor, are you back? Doctor? Yeah? Who was I? A spirit named Mother Flossy. She spoke a warning. I think it was about the missing girls. If what you say is correct, then what she said is important, very important. Mother Flossy is known as the spirit protector of Miami. She is a Black nun. Tonight, I want to talk to you about evil. What is evil? A lot of people think people are born evil, and evil is just a bad thing. What is bad? Some people think ghosts are bad. They're caught kidnapping these girls. Said it was a ghost who did it. Now, I don't know what evil is. I don't believe it is a ghost. No way do people become bad just because they die. Where's the proof of that? If anything, after you die, you should get a moment of clarity. I think people have been using this story of ghosts and evil dead to cover for their own actions. Ain't no ghosts killing people. I'm tired of this. My name is Nzinga, and I'm going to keep doing these podcasts until I change everyone's minds. All believing in bad ancestors does is keep us from finding out the truth of who the real killers are and bad people are. Now, I have lost a friend, Millicent. She is missing, and this Baba isn't who I'm looking for. In tragic news today, I have to report that just on the heels of the capture of the kidnapper of the missing girls, yet another girl has been reported missing. Authorities have not determined if the young girl has been kidnapped in a possible copycat crime. If you see the girl in this picture, you are asked to call authorities. As more information comes into WRBG, we will keep you up-to-date on this story. Again, anyone with information on the missing girl, Millicent Rowe, please contact local authorities. Hi, I'm Detective Roll. This is Officer Hunter. Hi. Listen, we're here to follow up on a missing lady to get an official report of a sorority sister. A young lady by the name of Millicent. I can answer your questions. Millicent was in my sorority. Just give me some simple information. When's the last time you've seen her? Where she went? What she was wearing? We were in this room taking pictures, and then, she left to go get something and never came back. Were there any strange men or people on campus? How about anybody that lives in this building? The Hey brothers? Yes. They're gay. They're an all-male fraternity. They have no interest in girls. We can't do anything with them. So have you seen anything out of the ordinary that could strike you as unusual? People have been saying their rooms are haunted. Maybe y'all should check that cemetery. You know, where all the kids went missing? I know we're not supposed to talk about it, but I can't. My girl is missing. That's all I've been thinking about. Ma'am, we're going to find your friend, OK? But let's stick to the real stuff. Well, that's what I think. Listen. Look, miss, you may be right. We're human cops, still. We're human police. We're not ghost cops, ghostbusters or something. So here's my card. Make sure you give me a call if you find anything out, have any other information, all right? And look, when you're walking about campus, try and protect yourself or something until we catch this kidnapper. Maybe the Black nun can protect you or something. But this Baba? This Baba ghost demon? We're not so sure about that, all right? So just try to protect yourself when you're walking about campus. I have to call Baba. Baba. Baba, come now. I need you. Baba, the spirit you saw is here. No! And I demand on the spirits to call your mother, Nana. Do not use my mother's name. That is not me. It is you. It can be used to help you atone and cross over. Baba wants to cross over. Baba not bad. Those kids were doing bad sex. I know. I saw. Baba was tricked. That spirit used Baba. Yes, he used you for bad, but I want to use you for good. Baba is good. Yes, Baba is good, and strong, and can help stop the killing. Baba doesn't like bad. So please help stop the bad. Baba will kill to stop the bad. Yes, please, her. Please stop the bad, and please stop all the killings. Do it for your mama. Baba will help you. You are good. Killing is bad. Baba will not use to do bad. Baba will do good. I will show you why Baba will help you. Baba. Where are you taking me? That bitch. Does she think she's better than me? Think she's better than everyone? Everybody doesn't have to have a husband. Women are made for men. Many women. It's women like her who's the problem. She's going to go keep preaching that marriage stuff. With this genie on my side, I can have... be kingpin and have all the women in the world. Matter of fact, you do something different for me today. I don't understand, master. Do you not already enjoy the big booty girls that I brought you? I need your ass to do something different this time. Genie, I need you to kill someone for me. Give me the name of the person, and it'll be done. Her name is Nzinga. Baba, where did you take me? This is me. Baba, where are we? I was a fighter. Yes, and you were a very good fighter. The best. Yes, you were the best. Including [inaudible] from Baba. The mean men. They tried to make Baba a slave again. Baba is from Africa where he is king. My Nana tells me to never forget. I beat them, beat them all to be free. To get them to free me. But they are bad. They are evil, like the ones [inaudible] than in Africa who took us across the sands. Nana tells them that they made us have sex with ourselves before we came [inaudible]. Nana says that sex is for our future, Baba's future. I don't want them to have Baba's future. You mean your children? My future, my children. They tried to make Baba kill them, his children. They want a king, an African king, for themselves. They want to control Baba. Make them stop, Baba. Make them stop. Baba said, no. Their children come to force themselves on Baba, but Baba says, no. Baba, that's horrible. Baba tired to fight, but there were too many. They burned Baba to death. They chained me, but Baba is not dead. Baba [inaudible] Baba, are you going to stop the boy that's taking the girls? Baba will take you into hell. Do not fear. I will handle this genie. I'm here to take you to my master, so you can become his sex slave until you die. I'm not going anywhere. You will go to hell, demon. You will not make anyone your sex slave tonight. Baba, Baba, are you OK? That demon has tricks. Baba will get him if only he would stay still. I think I know how. The Black nun. Flossy. She said something. It's on Dr. Bryant's podcast. What happened, genie? There's another, another being like me called Baba? Stop. Baba, the ghost from the park? Listen, children. You are in danger. Who is speaking to us? Tell us. This is Mother Flossy. There is a demonic spirit near you that's close to making its return. You must not let it complete its cycle. It's feeding off the souls of young girls. Mother Flossy, how do we prevent its return? Destroy its conduit. Is this demon called Baba? No. Something else. It takes no name. Please, I must go. This vessel is getting weak. Do as I say, or you will suffer a fate worse than a transition. Something else. It takes no name. Something else. It takes no name. We may not have any time. You gave her enough information. She may know who I am. Master, I have to return to my vessel. If I have more souls to feed on, I may be able to take on that beast. You will have to, or you will never regain your liberation. I will not let us down. I will make sure you won't. Baba, oh, Baba, I hope you regained your strength. Baba, the African King, I need you. Yes. Baba, let's fight this demon. Who is this Baba that you call for help? This is not Baba! Yes, I don't need my physical form to kill you. I can kill you as a spirit. You will never stop me. I am Kavas! Kavas the Great. You will bow to me. You all will bow to me. I will soon have my revenge! Kavas, or whatever your name is, I don't care who you are, but I'm going to get you. You will die. You were not made to be saved by your ancestor, Baba. What is this? This is the [inaudible]. No. No! I command you, go back. Go back to your master. Tell him that I'm coming for him, and I am coming with Baba. Baba, come to us. Baba, please. I know how we can destroy this demon, Kavas. Thank you. Baba, are you well? I am here [inaudible]. I have regained my strength. I am ready to send this demon to hell! Yes. Go away. I'm busy. This is Nzinga. I wanted to talk to you. Go ahead, Na. This is Nzinga from the Fellowship of Niger. Nzinga? You mean the girl that didn't want to talk to me? Yes, and if you ain't doing anything, we could talk now. So what would you like to talk about? Kareem, cut the bullcrap. I know you're dealing in supernatural. I have no idea what you're talking about. I thought you were here to see me. I know it's a little freaky from all you Fellowship girls, and a good pimp brother like me knows these kind of things. Don't flatter yourself. I know you sent Kavas to get... Where's the lamp? What are you talking about? Kareem, you are in danger. This spirit, Kavas, is killing girls, and he's sucking their spirits. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just trying to see what's up with your fine self. Kareem, stop. You know I'm a paranormalist. A spirit attacked me twice. A what? A ghost communicated. Now stop playing. I saw the spirit in here. You sound crazy. I'll get you a beer or something. There it is. Move out the way. This demon, Kavas, is killing girls. Yo, I think we could chill out. You want a beer or something? Kareem, I don't want your beer. Move out the way. I want to see the lamp. [inaudible] I didn't want to do that. Kavas? Is that your name? I go by many names. You're slower every day. I got her [inaudible] get her ready for it. Thank you. My body requires a strong soul. Hey, do I still get to have sex with her after you take what you need? You. Now I'll get my revenge! Nice try! What are you doing? Get off of me. Y'all raised by monsters. I will stop you, too. You and what army? I asked you nicely. I didn't want to hurt you, but it seems as if you aren't in control of your actions. Get off me. I can control this. This chain! My power. What is this? I will kill you! Kavas! Thank you, Baba. Freeze, monster. Put the chains down. It's not a monster. The monster is dead. Ma'am, step away. Back it up. I'm here for your protection. What? Where did he go? Why do they aim some guns at Baba? They are for protection? No, Baba. Sir, I'm telling you, put the chains down. Men here. This is no different from the others. Why do you need protection from Baba? Monster, put those brick chains down. You tricked Baba. Baba doesn't need your help. You want Baba, come get me. No one knows Baba. Baba can't do no good. The world is no good for Baba. Baba go back to death. What was that, a ghost? Baba was our fighting spirit. Our guardian ancestor. Hotep, and good evening to you. I'm here to report some good news. It's been two weeks since the last girl has gone missing. However, the story about what has happened to her is a little shaky. The police have refused to issue a report, and no one has been arrested in connection to the disappearances. It seems like this goes into unknown files of the police department. Again, we hear reports of this Baba being connected to the incident. However, unlike what had happened in the park, this time, Baba is almost considered a hero. If there's any hero in this story, I vote for my student. She calls herself a paranormalist, but I think that's cool. However, I call her an exorcist. Millicent, I really miss you. I don't know who else I could turn to. Baba, is that you?
