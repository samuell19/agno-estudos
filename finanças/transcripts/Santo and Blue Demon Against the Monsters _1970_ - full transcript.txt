And here is the referee... In the middle of the ring. And he pronounces the winners... As always Blue Demon and Juan Garza. FAMOUS SCIENTIST DEAD "The recently deceased Dr. Halder, who conducted..." "Bold experiments, surprised scientists by reviving..." "A dead person by means of a brain transplant." "We ask ourselves if his brother, professor Otto Halder..." "Will be able to revive him by using his own methods." I remember my uncle talking about an abandoned castle... Where he conducted his experiments. - What castle did he mean? - He never told me. Daddy, what kind of experiments did my uncle do? Why did he end up hating you? Maybe you should have incinerated his body. His last wish was that his body not be mutilated. FAMOUS SCIENTIST DEAD - Is something wrong? - Yes. - This thing about Bruno Halder. - Mh, it's a closed case... The professor is dead and buried. Yes Demon, but that man made a promise before he died. I have a feeling something bad can happen... - To Gloria and her father. - You lovebirds... Are all the same, don't make assumptions. Your girlfriend and her father are safe. I wish I was as sure as you are. Forget about it, go with Gloria and enjoy... Your vacation, as I will enjoy mine. Good luck. You are... A magnificent disciple, Waldo! Thank you, Master. Look at the Master. And remember that you were criminals... That he saved from your graves... To be revived. You shall obey his orders... Blindly. Master... You promised that I could experiment on live beings. I will keep my promise. Blue Demon! That masked once more. We meet again, Demon. Saint and you destroyed my life. But the day I died I swore I would get my revenge. Master, keep your promise... Let me experiment on Blue Demon before you kill him. Take him away! Pray Blue Demon, your time is up. No! Wait... This way would be too quick. - But Master, you said... - Shut up! Master, what will you do? I will destroy The Man in the Silver Mask. And who better for the job... Than his best friend, Blue Demon. You won't succeed, Halder. Good will always win over evil. Not this time. You will kill to the Santo. You, Demon. And then I will destroy you. Take him to the duplicating chamber! Now, Waldo! Come closer, Waldo. It's a perfect reproduction. No one will know it's not real. It's programmed to kill and to obey me blindly. Get out! I'll send him. It's time for revenge. I will begin to terrorize in a way... No one has even imagined. And my brother and his daughter who called me crazy... Will die. And I swear to Hell, Waldo, that they will wish that... They had never been born! They will beg for death while writhing in pain. Go destroy to the Saint! They will go with you. God forgive me... But I feel that my uncle is not dead. He always frightened me. A long nightmare has ended. However... Now that it's all over, I feel at worry... - I don't know why. - Forget all that, let's enjoy... The ride, relax. We better go. Ah! Santo, be careful! Ah! Let go of me! Santo, help me! Santo! No! Let me go! Let me go! Santo! Help! Let go of me! Santo, help me! Help me! Help! He's following us, step on it! - I was afraid of that. - It's unbelievable! No one can resuscitate. Maybe they stole the body. We should face the truth. If my brother is still alive, he is capable of having created... Those terrible creatures that tried to kidnap Gloria. I sense that my brother is planning... To destroy us, what shall we do? Why didn't you tell my father that Blue Demon is... - With them. - That's impossible! - Unfortunately, it's true. - He attacked us with rage... With the help of the monsters. Up until yesterday, Demon was my best friend. Maybe your traditional rivalry provoked him. We are only rivals in the ring. I can find no logical explanation. What if he were resentful towards you... - And you never knew? - Bruno Halder's monsters are... Obviously invulnerable. This is all the information I could find... On my brother's experiments. Maybe if you told me about your family history... We could investigate something. All right. You have your reasons for asking, Santo. Our ancestors are originally from Transylvania. In that part of Europe the legends about... Human vampires and other monsters were... Believed even by relatively educated people. Bruno, in spite of his exceptional intelligence... Became interested in studying these superstitions. Later on, completely given over to science... He got ahead of our times be resuscitating... People who had died of brain traumas. In his arrogance, he crossed the line between... Life and death, by resuscitating people who had died... Mutilated in accidents. Your brother has resuscitated and is forming an army... Of the living dead in order to destroy us. May Heaven protect us if you are right, Santo! They're alive! Put on the brain wave re-transmitter. Stay! Look at those men! They will never hurt you! I am your Master. I have given you life... You shall obey my mental orders, or else... I will destroy you. Go! No! - Help! Help! - Lupe, take the child. Get out! Get out! No! The footprints are from a large plantigrade animal... That comes from the lagoon and returns to it. What will you do? Find the animal. No, no, no! We are done, Waldo. Put him in the decompressor. That damned Man in the Silver Mask almost destroyed... One of my faithful allies. But tonight, Waldo... My fury will be merciless. Santo and my family which I hate, will die! They will kill for me. They will get my revenge. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Santo! The gun, on the floor! Demon, come back, the sun is rising. ARENA MÉXICO He said he would rip off your mask... And end your reputation as invincible. He has even made public statements. And if you refuse, he will say you were afraid of him. I accept the challenge. ARENA MÉXICO Santo! Santo! Santo! Santo! Santo! Santo! Santo! Santo! - Santo! - Santo! - Santo! - Santo! Santo! The fight of the century! In this corner, The Vampire... Versus Santo The Man in the Silver Mask. Two out of three falls, without time limit. Bravo! DANCER VANISHES - Good evening, miss! - Hello, could I ask a favor? I urgently need to go home, could you take me? I would be honored. You are the victim of the power of a human vampire. Tell me, for your own sake! We may have no way out, Santo. Not even the rays of the electronic gun could hurt him. Even so, I will keep you and Gloria out of danger. My uncle will also try to kill you. Those monsters can only attack at night... While I locate the mysterious castle... You will sleep during the day, and at night... You will go to crowded places. MAXIM When will this end? COFFEE SHOP Brazil, I come to sing to you. Brazil, I invite you to enjoy. I am reminded of an old love. In Copacabana. I fell in love while dancing this Samba. And left my soul in her arms. Brazil is singing, laughing, and crying. Your life is a carnival. Run! I'll cover you! Give her to me! Take them! - Is everything ready, Demon? - Ready. You said I was crazy. Look! Those have re-implanted heads and limbs... From other dead people, and these monsters... Which idiots like yourself still consider mythical... Were brought back to life and are at the mercy of my will! Even Blue Demon thinks what I want him to think. I have mastered life and mind. Now... I will disintegrate my niece. And you will suffer as you watch. You are wretched. Crazy. Do you hear me? Paranoid! Master... Frankenstein had this stuck in his neck. An electronic vibrator. Yes! Santo is alive. I will welcome him for the last time. You, go watch the entrance to the castle. And Demon on that side. Maximum intensity. Dear brother, let's see which science is more powerful... Yours or mine. Bruno, my death will in no way help your treacherous plans... Think! You will pay for using science for evil purposes. You are wrong, coward! Proceed, Waldo. Hurry, Waldo, more amperage! Blue Demon, wake up! It's Santo, your friend. - What happened? - I'll explain later. Innocent people's lives are in danger, let's go! In your last minutes of life... Look at what I, your brother, have created. - Ready, Waldo? - Ready, Master. Shall I proceed? Destroy them, Demon. Obey, I order you. I warned you that evil would never win over good. Santo, destroy the machines, I will cover you! THE END
