I've tried convincing myself. But I still don't believe your sweet talk. Can I sit closer? What for? To convince me? No, not that, my dear. Where are Kasino and Indro? This time I mean it. Believe me, Sarah. I've been dreaming about sitting with you for a long time. Without you glaring at me intensely. We will be a great couple. Believe me. I like you, Nino. I like you more. Not too hard. Thank you, Sarah. - Is that it? - Shush. It's just us now. All right. Gosh, my gums hurt. I feel like pulling my teeth out. Stop whining like a little boy! You are such a pussy! Listen, Sarah, tonight I will do anything you say. Is she really relaying the audio to the whole flat? Kasino and Indro must be behind this. I've got to go check on it. Oh, my! - Just get it in. - Hey! Gosh! It hurts! Not too hard. But how? Just put it a little to the bottom. Right here? Move out of the way! Move! That hurts! What is happening? What are you doing here? All of you? You relayed the audio throughout the flat! - That's right! - Yes! I can't sleep! - Relayed? What happened? - She really broadcasted the audio. - Maybe... - Shut your mouth! - It must be you! - No, it wasn't me! - It wasn't me! - It is you! Admit it! You must have done all of this. Who else if it isn't you? I've been staying in my room the whole day. Do you know? She's one of the owners of this flat, moron. I know. It wasn't me. Look, that's the microphone's cable. That means it was you! I swear it wasn't me. Hey! She got him! No. - Don't do it, Sarah. - Shush! Gosh. I can't watch this. See? I told you. Nino, help, it hurts! - Everybody, out of the way! - Over there, sir! What's the matter? What happened? You're late! Damn. What happened? Did she really just slap me? You slept like a log. Come on, hurry. Let's go, we're late. Cooperate! Sorry, boss. They left me. I'll just go alone. - Oh, my! - Shit! Sorry. Sorry, my ass. Oh, no! Stupid driver! That was my only pair of sunglasses! Pay me back! Can I help you? I'm looking for my auntie. - Who? - Do you know? Oh, it's right here. Thanks. You can just call me Dono. - And you are? - Erna. My name is Do... Dono. Let me help you with that. Let's go upstairs. Let's go. Let's go. Aren't you tired? No. Are you sure? Yes. Hooray. That's the bell. Gosh! It sounds funny. Press it again. Oh, my gosh! - That's weird. - This is amazing. It's probably a new type, now press longer. Did you really have to do that? I haven't had the chance to thank him yet. You shouldn't have hit him. I had to teach them a lesson. What do you mean "them"? I mean those boys who are renting a room in this flat. One of them is Dono. Why do you hate them so much? I don't hate them, I'm just annoyed by their pranks. Just so you know. I won't like it if you get to know them. I've never caught them in the act so far. One day, I will. Then I will have the perfect excuse to kick them out of this flat. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and up. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And now change sides. - One, two, three, four. - What a beauty, huh? - Sexy. - One, two, yes. Now turn around. - Who is she? - Keep it on. One... - How would I know? - ...two, three, four. - Probably a new tenant. - Okay. Run. One, two, three. One, two, that's good. Keep going. One, two, three. Okay, keep going. Dono, I want to apologize for what happened this morning. Oh, it's okay. I forgot about it already. Really. - You're so kind. - We're a step behind. No wonder he insists on going everywhere alone. Once again, I'm sorry. And by the way, thank you. One, two, three, four. - Where did you meet her? - Straighten your hands. - I'm not telling you. - Good. One, two. If you landed a jackpot, you should share it with your friends. Who is she, Don? One, two... - She's Ms. Sarah's niece. - What? - We're going downward and up. - Ms. Sarah's niece? - They don't look alike. - Okay. One, two, three, four. Now from the top. Look, a locomotive. - Is that Ms. Sarah? - One, two, three. - I thought it was a turtle. - Four. Hands going up. One, two, three, four. And one, two, three... - Let's go upstairs. - Up. Four. Okay. Hey, Don, I'm going to go and get some cigarettes. - Okay. - Three, four. One, - Let's just roll with it, Kas. - two, three, four. - Yes. - We're going left and right. Ready? One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. - You go! One, two, three. Can I help you? I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Indro. - I'm Kasino, over. - I'm Erna. Come in. Thanks. Have a seat. Hey! What are you two doing here? Turtle, miss. What were you going to say? Just say something. Make it quick. Well, ma'am... - What was your suggestion? - What? You say it! Hurry up! Are you really picking a fight with her? No, I mean... Can Indro and I join the exercise? That's just an excuse! Admit it! You want to flirt with my niece, right? Initially, but not anymore. We wanted to suggest - for post boxes to be installed. - Yes, ma'am. We already have post boxes. Are they broken? They're all open. - Right, Kas? - Oh, my. They're all closed. Right, nothing is open? Gosh, your zipper! Oh, boy. How dare you act like that in front of an adult! Go! Get out! Yes, get out! Ndro, wait. - Wait, it's stuck! I just can't force it. - Hurry up! I have another job for you. Make sure you keep those guys away. Don't let Kasino, Dono, or Indro get too close to Erna. Why not? Just do as I say! Who cares why? Okay, honey. Let's go upstairs, Erna. Damn. It's my turn again. Shit! Quick. - Careful. - Okay. Miss. Do you want some? - I mean rambutan. - What the heck? You're pretty but so mean. Miss, do you want some salak? You should peel it before you eat it. The rambutan is good too. Don! Crazy assholes! - Hey! - Gosh. Calm down, sir. - Move! - Make a turn! - Oh, dear, be careful! - Be careful! - We're going to crash. - Relax! It's okay, relax. - What the hell is that? - Acrobatics. - Hey! - Relax! Relax. Don't worry, relax. - What do you mean relax? - Relax. Take that! Three people don't fit on a rickshaw! Shit. Help me. Oh, dear. Help. - Quickly, my friend is stuck. - Lift it. Sir, hop on. Why would I hop off? - Hop on. - All right. No, not you. You bring bad luck. You made my rickshaw crash. See you, Don! Damn it. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Keep going. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Good. Now downwards. Good. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, and turn. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Good. Why won't she let me? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. To the left and right. Back and front. Now from the top. Help! A snake! Help! Hello. - What's going on there? - You see, Ms. Sarah's playing around with a snake. - A snake? Yuck. - Let them be. Let's sit there for a while. I got it. Don't push! Dono, would you do me a favor? Of course, anything you need. Can you meet me tonight at 7:00 p.m. at the park over there? What for? You'll see. All right! I'll be there. - Promise me, okay? - Okay! Snake! It's sliding in! - Auntie! Uncle! - Yes? - Help! - What is it? - Where is it? - A snake. Over here. Stay put. Not that one! That's not the snake! Damn it! Not that! - Oh, gosh! Ma'am! It hurts! - Shut up! Your grip is too hard! The snake is out! Run! Wait for me! Where are you going? I have a meeting. Let us tag along. No, it's for one man only. Hardening spray? That's not where you should use it. What's wrong? Hey. Who took my dentures? Where is it? Why would we hide it? It's not even worth selling. Your teeth belong in your mouth. You shouldn't be taking it off. It's not a spare tire. Why don't you just take off your whole mouth? Busted, Ndro. You guys are fools. It got up there by itself, you know. Whatever. He looks like a rock star. Kas, it's Erna. - Where? - There. Really? Hi. Did you wait long? Oh, my. It is her. - Are you sick? - No. You seem uncomfortable. Tell me, what is it? Promise that you won't be mad if I ask you something. I won't. Go ahead. What is it that I wanted to say? What do you want to ask me? Oh, no. He's so lame. He can't even go on a date properly. He won't get her. The girl is right in front of him. I would have hugged her already. He's the one on the date, and we're the ones frustrated. Do something. Testing. Come on, what did you want to say? I'm shy. Don't be shy, just talk. - Erna. - Yes? I want to... Dono. - Did you just fart? - No. What did you have for lunch? Why do I deserve this? Erna? Where have you been? You told me to buy the stuff we needed for our picnic tomorrow. - I went with her. - You shut up! Don't laugh. She won't even let me laugh. Erna, wait! Hey, wait! Damn it, pregnant elephant. What did you just say? Pregnant elephant. Damn it. Asshole. It's amazing that Dono even baked a cake. Is he opening a bakery? Maybe it's for Ms. Sarah. Right, there's Erna too. Let's taste it. Oh, no. It deflated. - It's flat, Ndro. - Dang it. Relax. Here. Explosive gas. It's inflated by itself. That's it. Good enough. My dearest lady, in my heart In his heart, her heart, whatever, man. Yes, whatever. Finally you're right next to me Did he say tummy? His tummy's chubby. I've always imagined your handsome face Did he just say handsome? - It should be gorgeous. - Yes. It's as soft as the moonlight What? Is the moon soft? As soft as a rock. Would we be together tomorrow United by love Your soft skin Your thin lips Your eyelashes I've fallen in love But why do you keep leaving me Who left? His grandma, maybe. I'm out of my mind waiting for you It's like waiting for the bus at a stop. What a loser. Maybe this is written in the stars Maybe they did write this thing in the stars. Maybe. Maybe you're not the one for me She is actually the one for me. Not for Kasino, and not for Indro. What's taking so long? Hey! - WHERE? - THE PUB. - WHERE? - THE PUB. - LET'S GO TO THE PUB! - SURE! Oh, dear. - Evening. - Good evening. What's Indro doing here? - Good evening. - Evening. - Can I take your order? - I'm still waiting. All right then. - Good evening. - Evening. Kasino? What is he doing here? There's so many people too. - Evening. - Evening. Good evening. Have a seat. Evening. Have a seat. Listen, to make it fair, I'll sit over there. That hurts! - Sorry. - What can I get you? Surprise me. Hey, wait! While we're all here, we need to settle this, okay? Okay. Whichever drink Erna chooses, the owner is the winner. Deal. And the losers must go home. And promise they won't be salty. All right. Tea, brandy, triple. Coconut, double, mixed. Whatever you're making. Good evening. Evening. Evening, sir. Erna? What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here at night and alone. - Go home. - But Auntie... You should go home! Do I have to shout to embarrass you? No. I'm going home. Off you go. Why are they here? - Where's Erna? - Not again. Why is Ms. Sarah sitting there? Oh, I have an idea so we can get out without her seeing! - Let's disguise ourselves. - What? - Disguise? - Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, that was our famous duo dancers. And for now, it's time for our outer space ladies. Let's give a big round of applause, for the Outer Space Trio Show! I'm sorry, just a moment. We paid for this! - Where are the girls? - I don't know! Why did you announce them when they're not even here? What do we do? You tell me! Come on, give us the show! They should have been prepared. Are we supposed to just sit here? - Let's just go home. - This is lame. Are they here? What are you doing? - I'm sorry? - I've been calling for you! Now go! - What? - Go! - What? - What's happening?

Oh, shit! Listen. If you cheat on me, I will break your neck. Of course I won't. Open up! Open! Do you want to come in? Yes! Yes. Thank god. That was close. Thanks, man. I mean, sir! Hey, wait up! Not so fast. Don't go. - Have a seat. - What's happening? Sit down. Relax, sit down. I know we're both feeling lonely. You ran away from your husband, and I'm being left alone by my wife. We're the same, sir. Yes we are, we're both lonely. - Oh, no. - Wait, let me get a drink. This is a disaster. Enough! Isn't it refreshing? Yes. Now let's lie down. Lie down, come on. You must have been tired hanging out there, now lie down. - Where are you going? - Shit. You made me drop this. Kasino? Indro? Why are you both out so late? - The usual. - We were hanging out. At night, you can call me Stephanie. I'm Jackie Sanders. People like you? Yes, look at us. The top part looks like a queen. But the bottom part is like a king. And look at me, a face like a mother. And legs that can play soccer. Oh, so you study during the day, and work at night? More or less. You're cute. I love your mustache. You're too kind. It's like the fence of a town hall. - Bye. - Bye! - You should stay the night. - No. - Why not? - I'm scared. - Of what? - I'm just scared. - It's all right. - Oh, no. Madame. - Please? - No, I'm scared! - Open the door! - Just stay. - No. - Stay! Open the door! - Oh, no! - Open! - Go hide! - Okay. Open the door! You asshole! How could you? Your wife is at work and you're cheating on her! What cheating? Where is she? - Tell me! - Nobody is here! What am I supposed to say? - Where's the woman that you brought here? - Nobody is here! I heard a woman's voice from outside! I was here all day just sitting and cooking! - Lies! - I swear. - You're lying. - I am not. - You must be hiding her. - I'm your husband! Liar! - Why would I lie? - Where is she? - I swear. - You're lying. Where is she? Nothing is here. If there's nothing, why are you out of breath? I can't breathe. Why? - Oh, no. I'm doomed. - Doomed? - What? - I'm so dead. What do you mean? What if all the neighbors find out? Let them! It's embarrassing! You should be embarrassed, you old fart! You're spending your wife's money on another woman! - Men are animals. - Darling! Where are you going? Darling! Where's the door handle? Where is it? Here. Where are you going? It's late. Shut up. That was close. Now go! Go! That hurts! You asshole! - Darling! - You jerk! I left my shoes! So annoying. Darling, wait! Where are you going? Where are you going? Darling. Sir, I left my shoes! It was right here. Right here. Thank you, sir! Darling? That hurts! Gosh. Where is Dono? He probably got caught by the security. Speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Yes. If you really want Erna, you need to stop pulling pranks on me. How many times have you done this? This isn't fair. So much for being friends. - This is your fault. - Mine? It's our fault. This should be an open competition. We'll fight like men! - Let me help. - Buzz off! I have to get Erna no matter what it takes. Even a duel! Let's just sleep. He's angry. Sir, stop right there or I'll hit you. Oh, there's a fight. Someone's going to die. This is going to be good. It's okay, don't worry. Come on, Don. Let's just fight. Okay! We'll shoot each other, okay! Gave me your blessing. Are you okay? I feel hot. Piece of cake. - Gosh! - Oh, my! Got you! He's not hit! Let me shoot you too so you can use your own coffin! Finally, there's something worth it. Oh, dear me. Not bad. Mommy. That man took a banana. What banana? Watch your mouth. Do you want me to teach you a lesson? It's true, mommy. Her eyes were shaking. Maybe because of the bulge. But why is her son so dark-skinned? Maybe the father is a locomotive. Mommy, the man took a banana. Leave him be. I know he has a banana in his pants. Indro, don't you have class today? No, I'm working on my thesis. - Aren't you going to work out? - I did, this morning. - I see. - Just a little stretching in my room. - Do you like working out? - Yes, a little. Just to stay fit. That's nice. What do you do? Domino, snakes and ladders. Weightlifting. My muscles aren't that bad, you know. - Really? - That tickles. Miss, the rice you ordered. Can you bring it to my room? My boss said to just drop it by to the flat. Excuse me. Who's going to take it upstairs? Don't worry, I'll do it. No, I can't let you do it. It's okay, don't worry. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Okay. Gosh. Is Auntie Sarah going to eat all of this? Erna! Hi, Kasino, did you just get home? Yes. What have you been up to? This morning I checked places to rent to open a gym. On my way home I bought rice because Auntie Sarah told me to. That's a lot of rice. You're lucky you have someone who can help. Shut up, dude. Oh, it's you, Ndro. I thought you were someone else. By the way, when are you opening your gym? Can I join? Of course, you can. What's that you got? Do you want some? Sure. Wow, chocolate donut. - Can I have this? - Sure. Wow. This donut is huge. Oh, I also have a huge banana. Here. What is he trying to pull? Unbelievable. Thanks, I won't be able to finish this. It's huge. Do you want to come in, Erna? - Maybe next time. - All right. Good luck with the rice. Buzz off you fool. - Are you tired? - No. Poor you. You're out of breath. This is heavy, of course I'm out of breath. Hey. - Come here, you. - What now? Can you do me a favor? What is it? I have to leave for a while. Please stand in for me and guard this room. Why me? We're friends. Do you know what this is? - Money. - Who says it's a statue? I mean, how much do I have? Count them! One, two, three, four, five, six. Right. This is for you. Go get cigarettes or something. I'm off. How weird. Indro, one more thing. You have to be careful. Don't let anyone fool you. Nowadays, a lot of people pretend to come and sell you stuff. Then when we can't see them, they steal our stuff. That's a huge responsibility. A university student like you won't get fooled now, right? All right? Bye. It's not about being a student, it's the money. Oh, dear. What's a light bulb doing here? It should be here. Oh, shit! That was weird. Let me do it again. Come on. Stay. Oh, no! Why won't it turn on? It's probably busted. I don't think it is, though. You're picking a fight. Hello! Gosh. It hurts. Good afternoon? I don't feel so good. I'm not sick. Gosh. What did I do? Good afternoon, sir. What do you want? I want to offer myself. What? I mean, the stuff that I'm selling. I'm sorry. Don't try to fool me. You can't flirt with me, and you can't fool me. You're just pretending to be a salesgirl, aren't you? Too bad, you're actually pretty. You're so mean. Accusing me of something so horrible. I'm offended. Just because you've met one bad person, you accuse me of doing the same. - It's because... - You shouldn't do that! Are you sure all salesgirls are frauds? I became a salesgirl so I can become the breadwinner for my family. It's embarrassing and also tiring. I can sue you if I wanted to. This isn't good. I can't be sued. What do I do? Miss. I wasn't accusing you. I didn't mean to offend you. It sucks being a girl, constantly degraded by men. That's true. Please forgive me, miss. Don't cry. Should I get you a drink? Sure. So you can freshen up and go back to selling. - Here. - I don't want water. My doctor won't allow me. Yes, only shamans drink water. I'll be right back, okay. - Coffee, tea, milk, corned beef? - Syrup. With ice? And coconut too? Have a seat, miss. Sit here. Now wait here. I'll be back. I'm turning into a waiter. I'm coming with your drink, miss. Miss? Miss? Where are you, miss? Thank you for the radio and the other stuff. You're a nice guy! I left you some medicine so you won't be sick. It's all gone. Gosh. Oh, dear. Shit. Got me again. What happened? Why do you look like a demon? I'm feeling dizzy. What? Sir. Here's my responsibility. Okay, how did it go? - It's gone. - What? I was tricked. - Meaning? - She took the radio and some other stuff. Gosh, Ndro. I'm so dead! What do we do? What about Ms. Sarah? Listen. You need to pay me back! With what? I don't care now! I mean how! Let's just make a bet. What do you mean? If I lose, I'll pay you back. If I win, let's just call it even. Sure. Where should we do it? What do we do? Don't worry, I've arranged everything. I have a friend who can win no matter what. Are you sure? Look. - Him? - Yes. - I'm ready. - Okay, boss. Will he win? Let's go. - Are you ready? - Ready. No way. What do you think? Hey! Sorry. Here. Move. Sorry. I told you. He'll win no matter what. Gosh, the longer the better. That hurts. Dropped your glasses? Here. What? He hit a different ball. Hold it in. - Are we done here? Come on. - Eat that. - Shit. - Hey. Come here. You lost. Indro, you need to pay me back the stuff that I lost. You lost the game and I need the stuff back. Or I'll tell Ms. Sarah everything. Sure. I'll also tell her that you like bringing home girls. What girl? At the nightclub, you gave a flower to one of the singers, right? And then you took her home? Don't tell her. Please. No. It's all or nothing. You might as well kill me. Whatever. Listen, you don't need to pay me back. Let's call it even. One more thing. - There's two? - This is a penalty. I have someone I'd like to treat. I need money. Please help. Now listen. As long as I can meet that singer. Piece of cake. We'll make it happen. - Really? - Yes. But the money? It's so far away. - How much is this? - Ten thousand. - Good. - Hey. - I'll tell Ms. Sarah. - No, don't. Well then, see you around. What a loser. Where is Dono? Hey, look, they have Menpora. I mean tempura. Tempura. They have their own teapots too called sake. Look, it's just dendeng, but they wrote bulkalbi on it. Look, deungsim. There's a food named deungsim. Where's Ju-do Chun? Ndro! Speak of the devil. We're eating good today. - What is it? - Are you guys paying? - Yes. - We got the money. Hello. I don't invite A Siong. It looks like a snack. Oh, no, it's a towel. - The menu, sir. - I'm confused. Let's just get two Ju-do Chun. We don't have that here, sir. - Whatever is special in this place. - Barbecue? - How about barbecue? - Sure. Barbecue. - I wonder why you guys are treating me. - Here you go, sir. - What's going on? - Listen, Don. Between the three of us, you are the one Erna likes. This is a congratulatory meal from us. Erna wants to meet you. That's true. But you have to disguise yourself as a woman, so that Ms. Sarah won't find out. Disguise. - "Dis" what? - Disguise. Focus, will you? Really? When? - Tomorrow. - Yes, tomorrow. - Where? - At the pub. The Marina. The usual place. Let's just eat now. - What's this? - Urap. Right, urap. - That's asinan. - Asinan. These are buntil. Wait. The food just keeps coming out. - Do we have the money? - Don't worry. You can put it here. Enjoy your meal. Oh, shit. My darling. I'm delighted to meet you here. I'm sorry about our last time. Please. Can I get your order? Do you have tea from Slawi? We don't, sir. We have soda. Sure, soda. And for you, Sir? - What are you getting? - Soda. - Soda. - All right. - Not too sweet. - Yes, sir. Dono keeps spinning like a wheel. It's like the longer he does it, the better he gets. What kind of drink is this? Why is there a marble? You're embarrassing me. Dono's angry. He's twisting. He's carrying him like a sack of rice. It's Ms. Sarah! Ms. Turtle! I caught you! Oh, no! I'm sorry! Where's your promise? - It was her. - It's not my fault! How dare you! - You said you were loyal. - I'm sorry. - You lied. - It was her! - Indro set me up! - What the heck! - You're embarrassing me! - You played with my feelings. - You didn't keep your promise! - I'm sorry! You said you'd be loyal! - Look at them! - What is it? - Look! - You're embarrassing me! I'm so disappointed! I never thought you would be this kind of guy! You're not a gentleman at all! How could you do this to me? I came here to see you, Erna. But these two said I should dress up like this. - You're lying. - I swear! Really, I swear! What happened to you? - What? - I'm sorry. - Maybe it was black magic. - Black magic, my ass. You're useless! Erna, let's go home. You guys took it too far. Look at us. Walking home like fugitives. I'm embarrassed. It's daytime and I'm wearing a dress. This sucks. This is all because of you two. Ms. Sarah is furious at me. This is so annoying. What is this? It was him! - Him! - Not me. Please don't shoot! Don't! Gosh! You hit me! Hey! That hurts! You're dancing. Don't fall down, Kas. It's hard. It hurts. Don, don't fall to the ground, not yet. What about now? - Gosh. - Where did it hit me? Let's all fall down. Wait, we're not dead? Yes, we're in a movie. Of course we're not dead. They kicked us out. What are we waiting for? Look. - Let's run! - Get them! Catch them! - Grab my hand, Don. - Okay. Don't run away! Quick! She can run pretty fast. We're finally free, Ndro. - Come on! - Come on! Come on! Come on! Look out. Sorry! It's all falling down. Nino! Look out! Take that! Keep going! - Look out! - Damn it! Shit! - Bye! - Bye! SEE YOU NEXT TIME Or maybe not! Subtitle translation by: Arina Nurul Azizah
