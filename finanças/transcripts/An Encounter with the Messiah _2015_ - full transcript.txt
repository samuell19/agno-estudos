(Intense music) (car engine running) (phone ringing) - Yo, you here? - Yeah, I'm here. - Got everything? - Yeah, I got everything. - Aight, I'll be out in a second. Hey, baby. Baby, you awake? I gotta go to the store for a minute. Gotta run out. - What? You're going out now? - Yeah, I gotta go out for a minute, to the store, but I'll be back. I promise. (distant police siren) - Hurry up. Hurry. It's really nice of the old lady to let you out and play with the big boys tonight, huh? Oh, you giving me the silent treatment? Tough guy. All right. Tough guy. (hip hop song) - Yo, is it in there? - Of course it's in there. You act like I'm stupid or something. I might be old, but ain't stupid. - Here, man. - You act like. You act like you want to be in charge or something. - Yeah, I wanna be in charge. I wanna be the boss. - All right. All right, fool, you the boss. You the boss tonight. - Good. Follow my lead. (refrigerator humming) - This gonna be all for you? - Yep, that's it for tonight. - Tonight is Friday. You have any plans? - No, it's been a long day. I plan to go home and do nothing. - Yeah, I heard that. I'm about to close up and do the same thing. That'll be $3.53. Enjoy your night. - I definitely will. - Be safe. - Thank you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. - Let's go. (intense music) - Put your hands in the air! Step back from the counter! Put your hands in the air! - Are you deaf? Put your hands up in the air and move back! Listen, pay attention because I don't wanna hurt you. You're gonna open the drawer and put all the money in the bag. Aight? Then we're gonna walk back there and empty that safe. - All right, all right, calm down. I got kids, man. - I don't care what you got! I don't care, homie. - Ask him if he's got a weapon. - Do you have weapons back there? - I just got a bat. - You reach back there-- Slowly stupid. Reach back there and pick it up. Give me that bat or I'll pistol whip you. Go ahead. What you waiting on? - Don't move to fast. Don't you move too fast. - Come on, man. I ain't got all day! Go get the tape. Go get the tape. Go get the tape! Get the tape, man. You're taking too long, homie. You wanna see them kids, you better hurry up. Man, hurry up. Get the tape. - You know what? I don't think I like the way this is going. - What're you doing, yo? - Aight, aight, aight, aight. - I don't like the way you talking to me. - I hear you, I hear you. - Who's the man? - You the man. - Who's the man? - You the man. I said you the man. I got you. - We cool now? - We good. We cool. - Back to the way it's supposed to be, right? - Ah, you ain't gotta do this, man. You ain't gotta do this, man. You ain't gotta do this, man. - (laughs) I'm just messing with you, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Put your gun down! - Man, what you doing, man? - No, you put your gun down. - I told you, I was playing with you, man. - I ain't playing, man. - You go get trouble, man. You in trouble now. - Put the gun down! Put it down! (heart beating) (gun shot) (gun shot) - Hold it, right there! Get down! (police siren) Pull the mask down! (police radio) - [Maria] Day 4,380. They say time flies when you're having fun. I guess, for me, time goes unimaginably slow. Twelve years. Twelve long years. 4, 380 days of constant pain, isolation and loneliness. I wake up every morning feeling abandoned and rejected. Longing, desperately, for human touch. A hug, a handshake, a kiss, even a conversation. That sounds pathetic. I don't know why I was chosen to suffer so much. And I've done everything I can to make it stop, but I can't. All I can do now is wait for death. And yet, for some reason, I hope. I still have this urge in me, this desperate desire to be healed. I would do anything, even though I have nothing else to wager. Come on in. Take a seat. Can I get you something to drink? - No, thank you. I really gotta go. - No, no, please. Don't rush. I mean, take a break from all your deliveries. It's the least I can do after all the church has done for me. Buying me food every day. Paying my medical expenses. I just don't know what I'd do without you all. Here you go. Squeezed the juice out myself. Took me forever. So, how's the weather outside? It looks beautiful. Good day for the beach, huh? You know, I love the beach. I loved going with my family. I even wanted to get married there. But with my condition, public places, they're not an option. You know, I used to be normal. You know, Peter, it's been almost-- No, over a decade. But there are some words that you just never forget. - I have never seen a condition like this before. I have examined you thoroughly, but I'm not able to understand as to why your body continues to release blood uncontrollably. It's as if your body is still menstruating. - But it's been two months. My period usually doesn't last more than five days. I usually don't even have to change my pad, but a few times during the day. Now I have to change it every hour. And if I sleep too long during the night, I have to get up and change my sheets and then shower. Doctor, I'm in so much pain I can't even leave the house but a few hours during the day. - I know you're frustrated. I'm really sorry to tell you, but your symptoms include not only abnormally heavy and long periods, but also fatigue, tiredness and shortness of breath. It looks like it might be anemia. But given your complicated condition, it's very difficult for me to say anything right now. - But we can find a cure, right? I mean, there are specialists we can talk to, right? Look, I'll do whatever it takes. I can not go on living like this. I will do whatever it takes. - Maria, look, we are trying our best. We already have your blood samples and we are doing tests on them. Once we have the results, we'll let you know what and for the course of treatment is. Until then, just go home and enjoy and live your life. And if you have any questions, you can always call me or visit me in the office. So let's take care of it for now, okay? - I gotta go. (sighs) - So what's going, sis? What's going on? What I miss? - It's good. Man, I miss you, bro. - I miss you too. - It's good to see you. - Good to see you, sis. - It's like you've been given another chance, you know? - Yeah, I know, I know. - You know, Bar, I've really been praying. I've been praying. No, hear me out. That you'll stay off the streets this time. - Here we go. Here we go. - Here we go, Bar. You have a daughter. Bar, she hasn't seen you in a very long time. - Yeah, I know that, sis. - You can't go looking for trouble anymore. That's all I'm saying. - Well, you know I never go looking for trouble. Trouble just finds me. - Exactly. So you know what? We'll just pray that it doesn't find you this time. - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah, whatever. Whatever, okay. (laughs) - I'm back in my hood! - Yo, are both in there? - Yeah, they're both here. Are you ready? Um, I'll be in in a minute. Just give me a sec. (inspirational piano music) (somber music) (birds chirping) - Hey, Bart! Hey man, is that you? - Yeah, it's me. - Well, come on up. Entrance is on the other side of the building. - All right, I'll be right up. - (laughs) All right. Dude, your eyes. Can you see? - Yeah, I can see. My eyes have been restored, man. - How? When? Where you been all this time? - I met a man who healed my eyes, man. (laughs) - Hold on. What're you talking about? I met this man, Jesus. I heard stories about him, though. About walking on water. Healing the sick. Just some radical stuff, you know? - You been drinking again? - No, I've never been more sober in my life. - All right, so tell me what happened. I mean, who is this Jesus guy? Is he some kind of a doctor or something? - I'm trying to tell you, man. No, he's not like an actual doctor. No. - Uh huh. So, how'd your eyes get fixed? - I was sitting by the roadside, like I always do, trying to get some change. You know, nothing special. I heard this commotion, you know? - What kind of commotion? - Would you two shut up? I'm trying to get some sleep back here. What are you two old dogs talking about anyway, huh? - Bartimaeus? Man, your eyes. What did you do? - My eyes have been restored, perfectly. - How? - That's what I'm trying to find out. - Well, I'm trying to tell you. So, I'm sitting at the side of the road, like I always do, you know? Trying to get some change. Nothing special. I heard this commotion, you know? Jesus. - [Gibs] He stopped? - He stopped, turned around and looked right at me, man. - Man, are you sure you're not making all this up? - It happened. Look at me. Look at my eyes. It's no smoke. No mirrors. - Gibs, man, why you so skeptical? You have a real, honest to goodness, miracle standing right in front of your eyes and you still refuse to believe. - How do you know it was a miracle? You weren't there to see it. I mean, for all we know, his eyes could have healed naturally. Look guys, I'm sorry, but all of this sounds like some drunken imagination to me. - Yeah, but what if this is for reals, man? Huh? What if Jesus is the real deal and you're wrong? Wouldn't you just let the man finish telling us what happened to him before-- - Let me tell you something, okay? I've seen it all. I've heard it all. People come around here all the time, talking about all the miracles they perform and all the lives they changed and 99.9 % of them ain't nothing but a bunch of phonies. Talking about the power of God. They wouldn't know the power of God if it came down and struck them down by lightning. So forgive me for my skepticism, but I have every reason to hold on to it. - Look, Gibs, I'm not trying to convert you or convince you. I'm just trying to tell you what happened to me. It was real. No magic tricks. But I feel you and I understand why you feel the way you do, but this man they call Jesus is. He's the real deal, man. - Well, good morning to you. - Oh, good morning, sis. (laughs) How did you sleep? - Yo, sis, that's the best rest I've had in 19 years. - (laughing) I bet. - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, I've been doing a little research this morning. Maybe you could check this out. Found something. If you look under jobs. - Just cause you look like my mother don't mean you can tell me what to do. - Hey, I'm just trying to help. - Yeah, whatever. - Whatever, I'm trying to help. So, tell me. How are things going with you and Chloe? - Well last night, she pretty much told me she wanted nothing to do with me. Now look, sis, I know I messed up, right. But I thought when I got out, we could be together. She told me, she just wanted to focus on getting her life together. She got no time for me. - Well, can you blame her? - Come on. - No, seriously. You left them and she's been raising Maggie on her own for all these years. And she's created a great life for both of them. I mean, she has a great job. She has a nice home. I mean, Bar, you can't expect to just walk back into their life and everything be back to where it was. You gotta work for it. You gotta earn this. - Word? - Yes, word. You know, maybe if you just focus on you. Get back out there and get yourself together, maybe then you'll have a shot at getting your family back together. - Yeah, I hear you. - Do you really? - Yeah, yeah, I hear you. - Okay, all right, all right. Hey, you want some bacon and eggs? - I would love some. I'm starving. - Oh, perfect. Why don't you go make us some. (laughing) What? I'm so serious right now. I'm starving. - Hey, yo, check this out. I want you to fix me a home cooked meal. - Dude, are you serious? - Yes. - I just worked all morning, looking for jobs for you. I'm starving. The least you could do is feed your sister. - One time. This one time. - If that's what you wanna say. One time. We can say one time. That's fine. - I got you. I got you. - The eggs in the refrigerator. - Maggie, have you seen my purse? Maggie? School, come on. Let's get going. - Are we gonna see dad today? - Maybe. I can call him, though, okay? But I think you and I need to talk. About what's going on with me and your dad. - You don't have to, mom. I already know. (phone ringing) - Okay, let's go. Get ready for school. Shoes. Hair. (phone ringing) Hello? - Hey, how's it going? - It's going pretty good. We were just getting ready for school. Maggie asked about you. She wants to know if you're gonna come by today. - Yeah, I got a meeting with my parol officer today. I gotta couple of job interviews already and a couple more lined up. I could definitely stop by tomorrow, after school. - Job interviews? That's a good thing. - Yeah, I thought so too. - Listen, we gotta get going. I don't want her to be late for school. - All right. Okay. Can I talk to her real quick? - Yeah, of course. Hang on a second. Hey, Maggie. Come on, your dad wants to talk to you. - Hi, dad. - Hey, baby. You getting ready for school? Yes, I'm all ready. Are you coming to see me today? - Nah, I have a few things that I need to take care of today. But I can definitely come by tomorrow after school. - Ah, I wanted to see you today. - I know, baby, but tomorrow's not that far away. - Yes it is. I have to go to school, then come home, then go to sleep, then wake up, then go to school again, then come home. That's far. - Well, now you put it like that, that is kinda far. I'll tell you what, how about I bring you a lollipop tomorrow? - A lollipop? Dad, I'm ten years old. Make that 20 bucks and you might be able to convince me. - Oh, okay. I'll see what I can do. So we have a deal? - Deal. - All right. Well, tell your mom I said bye. I'll see you later. I love you, aight? - Love you too. Bye, dad. - I'm Maury Cook, your parole officer. - I'm Barabbas. - I know who you are. Listen, I need you to fill this out, right here. It says that you are, in fact, staying with a family member. - Yeah, I'm staying with my sister. - All right, here's the rundown. I'm gonna need you to be here on the 30th of each month and it also says that at the time of your arrest a number of illegal narcotics were found in your system. So we're gonna be taking random urine samples throughout our time together. Any questions? - Why the random testing? That seems extreme. - Crime is usually a side-effect of drug use. So if your start using drugs again, we want to get you off the street before you start robbing people again. State usually frowns on that type of behavior. You feel me? The state also wants us to go over some of your past indiscretions. I.E., drug use, armed robbery and we're gonna come up with a solution to help you become a productive, taxpaying member of society. The floor is yours. - Well, I got a couple job interviews lined up for later today. - That's a good start, but tell me about your former associates, because peer pressure can be tough precarious thing. - Nah, I'm good. Most of my friends are either dead or in jail. - Well, you got that jail part completed. - Yeah, I guess I do. - All right, well, we're good here. Pleasure meeting you. I'll see you in 30. (somber piano music) (knocking) - Hi Gabriella. You know, you're a little late today. I was worried that you weren't gonna come by and see me this month. - I know, but my dad made me clean up my room and clean out the bird's cage before I left. - Didn't you beg your daddy for the bird? - Yes, but I didn't think I'd be the only one feeding him and cleaning out his cage. I mean, I'm not the only person in the house. It should be balanced. - Okay, you have a point there. You do have a point. So, where does your daddy think you are today? - Delivering my Girl Scout cookies? - Gabriella, again? You know, he's gonna start wondering why your troop is selling so many Girl Scout cookies. Listen, I told you this before, but if your dad does not want you coming over here to visit me, then you shouldn't. I mean, I love for you to come see me once a month, but you shouldn't lie to your father. - I know, Miss Maria, but if I told him the truth then he wouldn't let me come see you. I don't believe all the things he says about you and I haven't even gotten sick I've been here, so you're the only person I can talk to. You're like my best friend. (Maria laughs) - You are my best friend too. (laughing) You're my only friend. Okay, so let's have some of those delicious cookies you brought me. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Miss Maria? - Mhm? - Do you ever miss your family? - Girl, did you see that hat she had on? - Please, don't get me started. - Oh my god, that is so crazy. - Oh god. Maria, I've been meaning to tell you this. I am very proud of you. - Really? - I really am. Even though I am your little sister. (laughing) Do you remember those times when we were kids and you would put on those fashion shows? We would dress up and just pretend we walking down the runway. - Yes, you remember that? - Girl, I remember that. I mean, you would just go on and on about these big dreams you had. It's finally happened. - It is. - I mean, you actually did it, girl. I mean, look at you. - Yeah. - You have your own business and you are very successful. I just can't wait to see the rest of your life continue to flourish. I mean that. - Thank you. - Plus, now that all this is over with. You can finally start settling down. - Uh ah. - You did turn 30 today, after all. I'm just saying. Momma and Daddy are kinda getting tired of waiting on you getting married and having some kids. - Look at you. You crazy. - I'm speaking the truth. You know I am. - Oh, you're crazy. Anyway, I have a date tonight. Yes, I do. And he might just be the one. No. - Oh, okay. - [Gabriella] Miss Maria? Hello? Miss Maria? - Oh, I'm sorry sweetie. I was just thinking. - Thinking about what? - I was thinking that you're dad is probably wondering where you are right now. Time for you to go. - You know, even that name. Jesus. There's just power in that name, you know? I can feel it. Every time you mention his name, it's like the atmosphere changes. Something good's about to happen, you know? So, what did Jesus say to you? What did you say to him? - Well, after he stopped, he asked one of the people he was with to bring me a little closer, you know? - Excuse me, sir. My friend would like to speak with you. Can I take you to him? (inspirational music) - Tell me, what can I do for you? - Rabbi, I just want to see. - Go. Your faith has healed you. (crying) (inspirational music) - How're you doing? - Yeah, thanks for the interview. - Not a problem, man. Look, I took a look at your resume. Your resume is good, but I did a background check and some hits came up. That kind of history, man, we can't hire you. - Yo, I'm trying to do the right thing, man. - I know, but there's no way around it. I'm sorry. - Thank you. - All right. - What's up? What's up? You look like you done seen a ghost. - Yo, I thought you was dead, man. - You wish I was dead. Nah, I been shot five times already, baby. That was number six. I'm beginning to think I'm invincible. - Invincible, huh? You wasn't invincible that night, laid out on the floor with a hole in your chest. - What you doing on this side of town? - I'm just looking for work. Legal work. (laughing) - Like they gonna give you a job. What're you gonna do? Bag groceries? Do you want paper or plastic with that? Huh? What you gonna do? Work at a restaurant? Oh, you want some fries with that? No, no, I got one for you. You should work at a bank, because they love when criminals like you cash their checks. Man, they won't give you a job. They got people out here with doctorates and degrees flipping burgers. They won't give no criminal like a job. Didn't you get that memo, homie? - I'm not your homie. - That's right. You ain't my homie. But I'm gonna let you know what's been going on around here. This is my neighborhood. Mine. Nothing comes in here I don't know about. Nothing goes out I don't know about. I don't wanna catch you on my side of town again. You dying of thirst? I got the only jug of water. You will die of thirst. Do not come on my side of town again. - Don't gotta worry about that. You ain't ever gonna see me again. I'm just trying to take care of my family and that's it. Stuff like that you're trying to live, you can have it, man. - You see, when you follow instructions everything goes good. I like it. I like it. Ain't have no time for any of this. And that family of yours. Go ahead, jump, jump. Them pretty little ladies. They gonna need some comfort if you out there working all day. I catch you on my side of town again, I will be the one to comfort them. You feel me? (tires screeching) - Hey, friend. You look like you could use a helping hand. - I don't need any help, man. I'm good. So you all can keep it moving. - I didn't say you needed my help. I said it looks like you could use a helping hand. - Here's a few dollars. Maybe, get something to eat. - I'm not a beggar, aight? I just got out of prison. I'm trying to find me a job. Your five bucks won't do me no good. - Okay. - Jobs are very hard to come by these days. The economy hasn't turned around. God knows, our government is not doing anything to help people like you and me. - Got that right. - People like you and me? - Yeah, people who just wanna make an honest living. - Look man, I'm about ready to make a dishonest living. Something gotta give, man. Soon. - Hey, maybe there's a way that we can help each other out. - You know, I was thinking of exactly the same thing. I could help you. And maybe someday down the line, you can do me a favor. - What kind of favors are we talking about, man? Because I just got out of prison and I'm not trying to get involved in nothing crazy. - Hey, relax all right? It's nothing crazy. We're a non-violent group of activists. Okay, we're called The Eyes of The People. And we're just trying to make this country better. We're just trying to make things easier for people like you and people like us. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, that sounds all Kumbaya and cute, but what kind of favors are you talking about? - Always looking for young bloods like yourself to help us spread the message in a peaceful manner. You help us and maybe I can help you get gainful employment. - I'm listening. - Take this card. Go see this gentleman tomorrow morning. Tell him, Abaddon sent you. - If everything goes well, we'll give you a call. Just to check up on you. - That's it? Aight. Good morning. Is your manager in? - I'm the manager. - Abaddon sent me by here this morning. I'm trying to find work. - Abaddon sent you? - Yeah. - When can you start? - Yo man, I can start tomorrow. I could start today if you need me to. - No, look, I wanna see you tomorrow. 7 a.m. sharp. - For real? Thank you, thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Yeah, thank you! (inspirational music) (knocking) - Who is it? - It's me. - What're you doing? - I got a job. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm proud of you. - We gotta celebrate. We gott do something. - Okay, what do you wanna do? - I don't know. What you wanna do? Hey, baby. - Hey. - How are you? - What's going on? - Your dad is gonna be bringing home the bacon. - Dad, I don't eat bacon. Mom says it's not healthy. (laughing) What's so funny? - Come here, baby. (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) (inspirational music) - Hey, Megan. - Yeah, what's up? - I got a job. - Proud of you. (laughing) - Hey, you say something? - Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. I'm just so grateful. I'm happy for you, bro. Proud. - That's what's up. - That's what's up. - Good night, sis. - Yeah. (laughing) - Okay, Pete, make sure you give this envelope to Maria, along with the food box. - George, I'm not going in there. - What do you mean? Why? - That lady's sick. Shouldn't be that close to her in her house. Every time I go there, man, I feel like I'm gonna catch something. We should leave the box at the front door. - I know that the unknowns of this woman's condition can be scary, but it is our duty to help the poor and sick. Our Father loves and has compassion on those who need and requires action. We may think, "Of course God loves the poor." "He loves everybody." But it's not as simple as that. His character is presented as a model for our own. If he values the poor, we have to think about what that means for us. The task is really very simple. Help the needy. - Wow, Roger, this is a pleasant surprise. - Hello, Maria. - Hi. Can I get you some tea to drink? - Sure, that would be great. Thank you. - Have a seat. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - And we have a little something extra for you, Miss Maria. It's just a little something to help you with your house and all the medical expenses. - Really? - Yeah. - Well. This is really a blessing. And I am so appreciative. You have been so generous to me. Bringing me food every day and my supplies. I just don't know what I'd do without you. Bless you, Roger. - No need to thank me, Maria. You are very welcome. It's the least we can do and all the expenses can add up. - Yeah. They can. - Maria. - Well, do you have the results? - Yes, I do. - Okay. I mean, I feel really good about this one because it just seems so different from the others. - Well, Maria, I'm really sorry to tell you, but this treatment was not successful. - How can that be? I did everything you asked me to do. I was on that treatment for six months. How can it not work? How old are you anyway? Yeah, how old are you anyway? You look too young to be really experienced. Did you just graduate from medical school? You know what, maybe I should just find me a doctor that's older and more experienced to handle this. - Look, Maria, I'm fully experienced and capable to handle your case. - Apparently not. Because I'm still standing here with no answers. - Please, calm down. We have never seen a condition like this before. Please, understand. I've spoken to specialists in all areas of medicine and no one has any answers as to why this could be happening. - How is this possible? I have seen all of these, so-called, experts. I've flown all over the country. All over this world. I've had operations. I've had radiations, treatments, transfusions and no change! Except that... Except that, I've had infections from the surgeries. I've had severe body pain. And the vomiting. My body is a mess. And still, you can't tell me what's wrong with me? I've been through tens of thousands of dollars. All my accounts are wiped out. All my credit cards. And you have no answers. What am I supposed to do now? - Well, make yourself comfortable. Enjoy your life to the best of your ability and spend time with you family and friends, okay? - What family and friends? No one wants to hang out with me because no one can tell me whether this is contagious or not. They don't even come to the house or hang out with me. All they do is call. And most of them don't even do that. - Maria, I know this is hard for you, but given the unknowns for the condition, I think it's just best for you to stay away from large groups of people. Just until we can find a way to manage this and find a cure. - What? - Yes and you don't have to come to the office anymore. I'll call you. - You know, that's why I'm so appreciative of people like you. The sacrifices that you make for someone like me. It is so hard to wake up every morning and get out of bed. - I can't imagine what you've been through, Maria. But stay strong. Perhaps, one day the Father will send you a doctor who can make you well. And I pray that he will continue to give you peace and faith. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - How's the new job going? - It's going pretty good. I'm liking it, you know? I've made some new friends. The pay is pretty good. - Okay. Have you ran into any old friends? Any former associates? - Nah, nah, nobody. Like I told you, I'm keeping a low profile. - Are you sure? There's nothing that you wanna tell me? - Nah, nah. Nothing I can think of. - When you first came in here, I gotta admit, I was a little skeptical about your rehabilitation, but you surprise me. But the stakes are also a lot higher now, right? - You mean, because of my daughter. - Yeah. She needs her dad to be alive and out of prison. - Well, she already has that. - Well, let's hope it stays that way. - It will. - All right man, I will see you in thirty. - Thank you, Mr. Warren. - So, you know I've been practicing, right? And I need you to know, there's no way you gonna win this game. - Oh, you been practicing, huh? - Yeah, been practicing. - So you went from playing terrible to playing okay. - Really? Okay, you know what? Go ahead and kiki it up. We'll see who's laughing once I crush you. - You gonna crush me? - I'm gonna crush me? - Hey sis, you couldn't crush a grape, aight? Look, when I was inside, this game right here, this was the only thing that kept me from not going crazy. I'm a master at this. - Can I ask you a question? - Wanna know what it was like? It was great. I had a cellphone, the food was good, I made a lot of good friends. - Okay, stop being sarcastic. Really, how was it? - It was terrible. Food was awful. They treat you like a subhuman in there, sis. You're not even human. You're always one wrong decision away from getting shanked. - Well, you're out now. So we shouldn't have to worry about any shankings. - I wouldn't go that far. - What are you talking about? - I ran into Damien the other day. - Really? Crazy Damien? Always in trouble, Damien? Drug dealing Damien? - Yeah, that Damien. Look, sis, I told him I want nothing to do with him, aight? But things got a little heated for a second. I think he got the message, though. - Are you sure he got the message? - I'm sure he go it. He ain't gonna be bothering me again. - You know, I don't even wanna talk about this anymore. Let's just talk about something else. - That's fine. - How are things with you and Chloe? - I'm gonna ask her to marry me. - What? - I'm gonna ask her to marry me. - Are you serious? - I'm serious, sis. I got the ring and everything for her. I gotta go get it later. - Oh my gosh, I am so happy for you. - Thank you. - Oh, and Chloe, she's gonna be so excited. - That's good. - Wait a minute, you didn't tell me? - Yo, sis, I'm sorry. - That's messed up. - I'm sorry, sis. (laughing) - No, seriously. That's what's up. I'm happy for you. - Thank you, thank you. - So how are things going at work? - Work is pretty good, you know? The money ain't great, but it's a start. Making some good friendships. This one dude, Ryan, he's pretty cool. - So things are looking up, huh? - Yeah. I guess they are. - Well, you know what? Things are looking up for me too because, for some reason, I feel it in my bones. - You feel it in your bones? - That I'm about to crush you in this game. (laughing) Let's go. - You about to get crushed. - Oh, whatever. I ain't scared. You scared? - I ain't scared. Bring it. - I ain't either. Let's go. Mr. Sir-Talk-A lot. Tell me. - What's going on, brother? - No complaints, my brother. Sun's up. Breath in my body. Food in hand. Today is a good day. What'd you eat today? - I got me a little chicken salad. Nothing special. So, what you got there? - Man, my wife made me this half-pound burger. - Now, did you wife make the burger or did she go to Gibson's Better Burgers to get it? - Okay, she went to Gibson's. (laughing) But it's the thought that counts, man. Don't you agree? - Yeah, man, I agree. Hey, yo, check this out. I gotta ask you a question. Check this out. - Hey man, we just met and besides, I believe in taking things slow. - Yo, man, you tripping. It's for my girl, man. - Are you ready for this, bro? I mean, it's a big deal. Nothing to rush into. - Yeah, we been together for years. It's time to make it official. - That's awesome, man. I'm happy for you. - I appreciate it, my brother. Thank you. - Can I be the best man? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I believe in taking things slow. (laughing) - That's cold, bro. That is cold. - No, it's not. - We ain't what you-- - Look, I don't even want to know. Here, you've got a telephone call. - It's not what you think, yo. - It really isn't. - Hello? Oh, hey Abaddon, how you doing? Yeah, everything is going well. I owe you one. I appreciate it. - Ah, we're so pleased you're doing well and taking care of the family and all. Hey, listen, remember that little favor I asked that we might need of you down the road? You think you could help us out this week? We got a great opportunity coming up. We need a little extra muscle. Could you meet us at the warehouse on Saturday night? Let's say, 7:30. Ah, that's great. All right, we'll see you then. 7:30 at the warehouse. Thanks, man. Bye, bye. - So he's in? - He's in, man. - All right. - Like Flynn. - Good. - We've got a 15 minute time window to get in, do what we need to do and get out. There's normally only one security guard and they don't normally carry guns. Middle-aged guys just trying to make a buck. At 10 p.m., the guard normally takes a 15 minute break. That's our window. (knocking) Come in. - Sorry I'm late, Abaddon. - Hey, no problem man. Pull up a chair. We're just getting started. Bring our friend up to speed. - Absolutely. We're gonna meet up at the Metropolitan Building at 9:45, sharp. Josh has a list of everything we'll need. Masks, bolt cut-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Masks and bolt cutters? Abaddon, I told you I didn't want to get involved in anything that even looked like trouble, man. - Whoa. Before you jump to any conclusions, let me explain. Nobody's gonna get hurt. We're not stealing anything. In fact, nobody will even know you were even there. We're doing this for the greater good. It's time to stand up to the government and let them know that we're just not gonna take it anymore. We've got to stop them. It's time to take a stand. Are you with us? Can I tell you what we're abou to do? - I'm listening. - [Maria] Come on in, Peter. You'll have to excuse me. I'm not feeling very well today. Thank you. How was your weekend? I'm sure you did something very exciting. I'd love to hear about it. I'm sorry, can I get you something to drink? - No, thank you. - So, how's Roger? I was so glad to see him last week. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore. I'm not trying to be rude, but it's just, I come here week after week and I just don't get it. How is it that a woman like you, a woman that has nothing. A woman that has no family, no friends, who has to get groceries delivered to her, talk about the weather? And you're dying. You're dying. You should be upset. - Is that what you think? Is that what you think? That I'm not upset? Or angry? Or sad? Or depressed? I battle with that every moment of every day, Peter. I have to fight just to wake up and get out of bed because I have indescribable pain and uncontrollable bleeding. And to top it off, I'm ostracized by this whole community. And the only man, the only man, that comes to see me, wears a mask and latex gloves when he's in my presence. So yeah, I'm wounded. Everyday. But I have hope. A glimmer of hope, Peter. Get on my knees every day and pray to God and whoever else will listen to me that this will go away. Just go away so I can be normal again. (crying) - Maria, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said the things I did just now. I was judgmental and the truth is, I guess I really don't understand what you're going through. I guess, it's hard when you try to reach out to somebody and everyone tries to treat you like a leper. You reach out and all your receive is judgmental comments, criticism, people even gossip about you. But I don't wanna be like those people, Maria. I don't wanna be like them. I'm sorry. I don't know if your'e interested or not, but I heard about this man by the name of Yeshua. Some say he's this miraculous healer. I don't know whether or not I believe it or not, but if I had your type of faith, I would try to reach out to him. - So, how'd it go? - I think I finally get what you been telling me these past few months. - What? Really? You mean, you have been listening? All this time, I just thought I was talking to myself. - I'm serious, Rog. I think I just did something I shoulda done a long time ago. - I'm proud of you, Pete. - Okay, you got me. What're we doing? - Allen, fill him in. - Absolutely. We're gonna enter the building here, through the north entrance. Climb the stairwell here, up to the fourth floor. Bar, you and Josh are gonna guard the floor, while I access the office, hacking into the computer using the mainframe-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. You can hack into a government-owned computer? Why? What for? What is this gonna accomplish? - We're gonna shut down their system for 24 hours. Why? Because we want them to know they're not untouchable. That they can't just do whatever they want and there be no pushback. - But I told you, I don't wanna get involved in anything crazy. I made that clear. - Crazy? What's crazy about standing up for what you believe in? What's crazier about standing up against reckless tyranny? The republic seeks to strip you of your beliefs, your identity, your way of life to ultimately turn you into some sort of drone, a mindless citizen that never questions and just does whatever it's told. Well, I for one can not stand for that. And tonight, we're going to send them a message that they will not soon forget. Are you with use or are you gonna go home? (intense music) - Hey, how do you know there not hidden cameras all throughout this building, man? - We do know. There are five cameras on each floor. All the video is digitally recorded and stored on servers. Ha! I just erased any video footage that we were here and replaced it with foot from about an hour ago. It'll look like no one was ever here. But we'll know. And they'll know. - You almost done? We've run out of time, man. - Just finished. About five minutes to spare. - Hey guys, the guard is back in the building. - All right, we're on our way out. Let's go. (rustling) (intense music) (intense music) - Hey, what're you doing here? What're you doing in this building? - We just trying to get out of here, man. Look, we didn't take anything. - That's not gonna happen. - We just trying to go. - I can't let you do that. Don't move. - Whoa, whoa. Why you reaching for your gun? - Get your hands behind your head. Right now. Both of you. - We're just trying to get out of here. - Hey. - Just let us go. - I'm not gonna tell you again. - Come on, come one, look. - Get on your knees. Put your hands behind your head. - Look at my hands. I'm unarmed, okay? I'm unarmed. Come on, we just wanna leave, man. - Just take it easy. - Shut up, man. Come on, man. - I'm not gonna tell you again. I will shoot you. - Just put your gun down, all right? We just wanna go. Don't nobody have to know we was here. - Don't make me do it. I'm telling you, bro. - You're not gonna shoot us. - Don't make me do it. - There's probably not even any bullets in that gun. I'm gonna walk over to you and I'm gonna take that gun out your hand. Okay? And me and my friend, we just gonna leave. We gonna leave. Don't nobody gonna got to get hurt. - Don't make me do this. - Come on, please. - Don't make me do it. - Come on. (gun shot) - No. No, no, no. (somber piano music) (phone ringing) - Yes, I'll accept the call. - Yeah, it's me. (crying) Baby, I'm so sorry I'm putting your through this again. - They're saying that that we're never gonna see you again. That this is it. Should I still be hopeful? - Please remember that I always loved you. It's never changed. I screwed up my life in every way and I never deserved you or Maggie. Please tell my daughter, please tell my little girl that I love her. (crying) I'm sorry I wasn't there. - [Guard] Time's up. - Aight, man, aight. I gotta get off the phone now. Don't wait for me, Chlo. You hear me? Don't wait for me. Try to find your happiness. - [Maria] Is this possible? A man who can heal with just a touch? I've been to the best doctors and physicians, but no one was able to help me. How can I trust someone I've never seen? I am so weak and so tired and I have been disappointed so many times. What if this is just like the others? But I can't ignore this urge in me. This desire for an answer. I wonder, would this Jesus be able to heal me too? I know I should not leave this house, but this is a risk worth taking. (inspirational music) This could be my only chance. (inspirational music) (heart beating) - Who touched me? - Master, the people are crowding and pressing. There is no way we can know who touched you. - Someone did touch me. I can feel the power in the virtue leave my body. (crying) - It was me. I touched you. Please, forgive me. It was me. It was me. I touched you because I have this issue, this issue of blood for 12 years. The doctors, they don't understand. They couldn't cure. I spent everything trying to get better. Instead of getting better, I got worse. But I touched you. I touched you because I believed you can heal me and you did. You healed me. I can feel it. I can feel it in my body. I can feel it. (laughing) My God. - Daughter, your faith has made well. Go in peace. (uplifting music) (foreboding music) - What're you in for? Hey, I'm talking to you. What're you in for? - Wrong place at the wrong time. - Me, the guy in the other and the other cell, all wrong place, wrong time. (snickers) I knew who you are. I know what're doing here. I know all about you, Barabbas. - If you know me so well, you know I'm not the one to be played with. And if you know everything, why you asking me? - Just making conversation. - Conversation, okay. Listen here, homie. You and me, we two criminals that made every possible wrong decision to get here. Me, personally, I had every reason to do the right thing. But doing the wrong thing seems to come so natural to me. The wrong friends. Wrong career choices. The wrong path. And inevitably, here I am. Locked up with you. I used up all my choices. I used up all my chances. Only way I'm getting out of here is in a body bag. - You and me too, my friend. - Who's he? - That's the King of the Jews. Jesus of Nazareth. - That's him? He don't look like no king to me. He look just like one of us. - Yeah, and they hope he dies like one of us too. Some religious leaders dragged him in here last night. - Yeah? What'd he do? - It's what he didn't do that got him thrown in here. See, they expected him to bow down to them and the way they did things. When he didn't, then it became a problem. - And they trying to get him executed? - Religion can be a dangerous thing, my friend. It'll do just about anything to protect itself when threatened. - You think they gonna take it that far? Put an innocent man to death? I doubt it. I think he's the one that's gonna get that pardon. - I think, within the next few days, we're gonna see some unexpected things unfold around here. (somber music) - You know, I just, I finally started to think that we were actually gonna have a normal life. You know? And all the pieces, they seemed to be coming together. And I was starting to feel secure. But now, I don't even know what I'm gonna do. (crying) - There's nothing you can do. You've done all you can do. You've prayed all you can pray. And here we are. It's in God's hands now. Only He can fix this. It's gonna be okay. (crying) (knocking) Hey, are you expecting anyone? - No. (knocking) (crying) (thundering) - How? I thought-- - Baby, I've been given another chance. I was on death row with this other man, right? But there was something different about him. A few days earlier, some of the religious leaders, they had him arrested for no reason at all. They tortured him. They interrogated him for hours. And the head of this group, he wanted him dead and more. They even got witnesses to testify against him. Baby, they lied on him. He just stood there and took it. - Who? Who was he? - His name was Jesus and he took my place. (inspirational music) - You know, we've been hearing and reading about this man for so long and he's here. I never thought it would happen in my own life time. But he's really here. This is an exciting time. Where is he? Can you lead us to him? - Wait a minute, wait. Before you go any further, did you have to give this man anything? An offering? A gift? Your first born? - I didn't have to give him a thing. He just asked what he could do for me. That's it. I think he knew I didn't have anything to give anyway. Beggars usually don't. Hence the begging, you know? - So you gonna stand there and tell me that this King of Kings, as you call him, stopped everything for a lonely beggar? - That's exactly what I'm telling you. This man cares about everybody, even lowlifes like us. You know, it happened, man. It's real. He healed my eyes. - What did you do to deserve that? What makes you so special? - Nothing special about me. Nothing at all. I was a lowlife, you know? I lived under a bridge. I ate garbage. Smelled like garbage. Half the time, I felt like garbage. But ever since I encountered the Messiah, something's different, man. I'm different. - I have to meet him. I have to see for myself. I just don't wanna hear about it. I want my own experience, man. - Absolutely. We can go right now. Gibs, I wanna take you with us. - Look, before you say anything else. I don't have time to be chasing any more preachers. Look, if you wanna go, go ahead and go. I respect that. But respect my decision. I'm gonna stay right here. - Gibs, you have nothing to lose. Just come and meet the man. - Sorry, Perez, I just don't have it in me anymore. - Can I say one more thing before we go? - I'm listening. - Look, I can stand here all day long and tell you about this man and what he's done for me. I could write a song or paint a picture, but nothing I could do would do it any justice. What happened to me was just that amazing. You gotta meet him for yourself. Trust me. You'll never be the same. So what do you say? All three of us. We can go meet him right now. (inspirational music)
