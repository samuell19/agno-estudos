What do you think you're doing? Hey, come back here! [Pizzicato music] [Pizzicato music continues] Give me that! What do you mean by taking stuff off of people's cars? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Well what do you got to say for yourself? Go on. Get out of here. (Clock ticking) (Alarm rings) (Crashing sound) (Turntable clicks) (Record noise) [Wagner's "ride of the valkyries" plays] [Music continues] [Music ends] - Well, Mrs. Woodbury, I've completed the investigation of your husband. - And did you find out where Martin has been going after work for all those nights? - Yes ma'am. Here you go, Mrs. Woodbury. Here's some photos of your husband. It seems, Mrs. Woodbury, that the reason that Martin's been coming home late is that he's been playing (chuckles) Video games at an arcade near his work. Um, by the way.. He's very good at PacMan. (Laughs) - I knew it. I knew it. That little runt! Oh, ever since I found that bag of quarters I began to suspect something, but I didn't have any proof. Now... (Laughs maniacally) He thought I couldn't catch him. He thought he was too smart for this old battleaxe, well he was wrong! Oh... wait 'til I get my hands on him. I'll wring his pencil neck, that little rug rat! He's going to spit teeth when I'm through with him! I'm going to hit him so hard his relatives are going to feel it! - I'm sure you will, Mrs. Woodbury. Now, ah... Here's my bill. (Laughs nervously) I've, ah... listed the expenses down right there, see? - That's a lot of money. - I accept personal checks. Or cash. (Door opens) (Keys jingle) (Car door opens) (Car door closes) (Starter cranks) (Starter cranks again) (Hits steering wheel) (Hood releases) (Car door opens) (Car door closes) (Lifts hood) - Hi, Zack. (Hits head) Sorry, I didn't mean to give you a start. - Oh, hi pastor. - How's your head? - Ah, it's alright. Don't worry about it. - Car trouble? - Yeah, it won't start. I don't know what's wrong with it. I got a friend who owns a repair shop though. I'll let him take a look at it. So... what brings our pastor into this neck of the woods? - Oh, I jog by here all the time. Saw you working on your car, so I thought, well... just drop by and say "hi." (Chuckles) Ah... and, uh... invite you to our "all church work-day party" next Saturday. - Ah. What kind of work they going to be doing? - Well, some of the guys are going to pour a sidewalk behind the main sanctuary... ... and, uh... there's some classrooms to paint and clean. And, just general maintenance. Think you can make it next Saturday? - Ah... well, um... I'm kind of in the middle of an investigation right now, well... ...you know my work forces me to work some pretty... you know, unusual hours, ah... So... I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. - That's okay, Zack. I understand. But, if you do get a chance, feel free to drop by. We'd love to have you. - Sure. Okay. - Well, got to run. No pun intended. - (Chuckles) See you later, pastor. - (Zack) Hey, Eddie. Did you find out what's wrong with it? - Oh, hi, Zack. I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you. - What's wrong with it? - Well, do you want it in order of importance, or alphabetically? - That bad, huh? - Worse. Now, Zack, you've been neglecting this car, and you can't do that. You neglect a car, it's going to break. It's as simple as that. - All I want to know is "how much" and "how long." - Ballpark? - Ballpark. - Couple of days and six hundred bucks. - Sss... six hundred bucks? All I want you to do is fix it, not gold plate it. - I try to tell you, Zack, you can't neglect your automobile. - Okay... What am I supposed to do in the mean time for transportation? - Hey, what am I? Hertz rent-a-car? I fix 'em. I don't rent 'em. - So, I gotta pay for the rental on top of the six hundred bucks? - (Exhales) Look. I'll tell you what. And I don't do this just for anybody. But, since you're a friend... I got a dodge out back you can use while your car's in my shop. - Hey, thanks Eddie. I really appreciate that. - Come on. It's that one over there. - (Laughs) You've got to be joking. There's no way I'm going to drive that dog sled. - Hey, I paid 75 bucks for that car. - (Mocking laugh) 75 bucks. - It's a classic. And it runs, too. - No. Hey, it's either that or pay for a rental. (Keys jingle) (Car door opens) (Car door closes) - Hey, Eddie. There's no gear shift. - It's a push-button transmission. It's the row of buttons on the left side of the dash. - A push-button transmission? (Engine starts and revs) (Button clanks) (Engine revs) (Crash) (Tires skid) (Dog starts barking) Eddie, this is beginning to put a severe strain on our friendship. (Button clanks) (Engine revs) [Classical music] (Engine shuts off) (Car door opens) (Car door closes and metal hits ground) (Phone rings) (Phone continues to ring) (Lock clicks and door opens) (Phone still ringing) (Bangs receiver) - Zachary investigations.- (On phone) May I speak to Mr. John Zachary, please? - Speaking. - Hello Mr. Zachary, my name is Gordon Andrews. I am with pacific southwest insurance. I found your name in our files as having done some freelance investigating for p.S.I. In the past, (on phone) And we'd like to hire your services for a case we are presently working on. - Okay, I charge three hundred dollars a day, plus expenses. - That'll be fine, Mr. Zachary. Why don't you come down tomorrow, say... 10:00 A.M., we'll give you all the necessary information, sign some papers, and get you started. Okay? - Okay, I'll be there. - Very good, Mr. Zachary, we'll see you at ten. - Thank you, Mr. Andrews. Bye. (Feet clunk on desk) Whoa...! (Crash on floor) (Alarm ringing) (Crash) (Turntable clicks) (Record noise) [Wagner's "ride of the valkyries" plays] (Engine noise) (Engine shuts off) (Car door opens) (Door closes - mirror hits ground) (Elevator dings and doors open) (Typing) - Hi, I'm John Zachary. I have an appointment with Mr. Andrews. - Yes, Mr. Zachary. One moment, please. Mr. Zachary is here to see you sir. Yes, sir. Right this way, Mr. Zachary. Mr. Andrews, this is Mr. Zachary. - Good morning. - Morning. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - Oh, I almost forgot, Mr. Andrews -- the buick dealer called and said that your riviera is ready to be picked up. - Good. Thank you, miss Johnson. Well, Mr. Zachary, how are you today? - Fine, Mr. Andrews. How are you doing? - Call me "Gordon." - Well, as long as we're getting informal around here, everybody calls me "Zack." - Okay, Zack. Let's get down to brass tacks. This is Richard Decker. He has a policy with our company insuring a building in the Malibu area. This is a copy of the policy. Now the building was insured for $200,000. - Was? - It burned down two weeks ago. Now the building was probably worth a lot more than that, but no company wants to pay if it doesn't have to. - Doesn't have to? Are we talking arson here? - Maybe. - Well, what does the fire department report say? - Here's a copy of the report. "Officially," it was an accident. - But you don't think so. - We want to be sure. - Well did this, ah... Decker... Have any reason to torch his own building? - That's where you come in, we want you to find out if he did. Here's all the information we have on Decker... His employer, bank accounts, assets, credit rating... it's all there. What we want you to find out -- is there any reason for him to need a large sum of money. Is he in any kind of financial trouble? - (Chuckles) Well, I haven't really had time to read these financial statements, but... At first glance it would seem that this Decker is very solvent. - Yes, but unfortunately... A trw credit rating doesn't show things like gambling debts, or other kinds of "under the table" activities. - Ah, so you want me to take a closer look at his personal life to see if he has any... Ah, shall we say, ah, major money worries? - Exactly. - Maybe he's just greedy. - Maybe. But what we need is something tangible. Otherwise we'll have to pay. - Do you think he did it? - Personal opinion? Probably not. But we don't deal in speculation, we deal in facts. Now, here's an advance on your fee. The balance will be paid when you finish your report. And Zack... Try not to take too long. - I understand. I'll do my best. (Engine noise) (Engine shuts off) (Car door opens) (Car door closes) (Kick) (Bumper crashes) - That's an "interesting" car. - It's not mine. I borrowed it. Mine's in the shop. - Oh... - Who are you, anyway? - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Jeremy Logan. - Am I supposed to know you? - No, not really. Well, we go to the same church. - Well, was there something you wanted, or did you just come by to shake my hand? - Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I actually kinda wanted to ask a favor of you. - Well, I was just going inside for a cup of coffee, why don't you come inside and tell me what's on your mind? - Okay. - So... you said you wanted to ask a favor. - Yeah. Um... Well, ever since I was a little kid, I've always wanted to be a private investigator. I used to watch all the t.V. Shows, likeharry-o, and rockford files, and Magnum p.I. And I always wanted to be like those guys. You know, poke around, look for clues and solve the "big case." (Sighs) Well... as I got older I started really thinking about it as a profession, and... and I really want to do it. I'm taking a police science course at state, and some other courses I thought might be helpful... And, I'm trying to learn everything I can about it. - Um... So... what's the favor? - Ah... well... I know that experience is the thing that really counts, and... I tried to think of a way to get some. And I knew you from church, and knew that you were a p.I., and... I thought maybe I could... you know, ah... Hang around a little bit, ah... Pick up some tips? - Uh... I, ah... really... Don't need a partner. - Oh, no! I'm not suggesting that. I just thought that... Maybe I could help out. You know, I'll run errands, file papers, answer phones... Whatever. I'm not looking for any pay. I just want a chance to be around and pick up some experience. - (Sighs) Well... I don't know, I... - I promise, I won't get in your way. I'm really easy to get along with, and I'm a hard worker. All I want is just the chance. You won't be sorry, Mr. Zachary. - (Sighs) Well... uh... oh, I guess it wouldn't hurt to have you hang around a little bit, ah... - Well, thank you, Mr. Zachary. - Yeah. Call me "Zack." - Thank you, Zack. - Ah... one more thing... - What's that? - No more cracks about the car. (Engine noise) - Hey, Zack, I really appreciate this opportunity you're giving me. - Well, I think you're going to find out this work's a lot more boring than you think it is. - Well every job has its boring parts. Oh, Zack, did you hear about the work day at church this coming Saturday? - Yeah. I got a "personal" invitation. - Are you going? - Nope. I got an appointment with a bucket of balls on the driving range on Saturday. - I went to the last one. Not too many people showed up. I guess it's really hard to motivate people to get involved at church. Everybody expects the building to be perfectly cleaned and maintained, but nobody seems to want to help to do it. I don't know, we had a good time, anyway. - That's not my idea of a good time. - Well, what's your idea? - My idea of a good time? A sunny day, about ten feet of packed powder, freshly waxed skis, and no lift lines. - Yeah, that would be nice. But I think getting involved at church can be fun too. Well, not in the same way, of course, but... I think there's a real sense of satisfaction that comes from doing what you know god wants you to do. And... I don't know, I think that can be... More satisfying than... A perfect run down "stump alley" at mammoth. So, what do you say? Can you give US a hand Saturday? - Ah... I don't know, Jeremy. Let me think about it, huh? - Well, okay. But I think if you decide to, you'll be glad you did. - We'll see. - Wanna listen to some music? - Sure. - Here. There's a tape deck in the glove box. It's about the only good thing about this bucket of bolts. - Well, what is it? - (Italian accent) Vivaldi! (Cassette clicks) [Classical music plays] [Classical music continues] [Music stops as record needle skids] [Classical music starts again] [Classical music continues] - Ah... Terrific. - What's that? - A flat tire. [Classical music continues] (Tire skidding noise) (Crashing sounds) (Door hits ground) (Tire and truck noise) (Birds chirping) [Classical music starts again] [Music ends] (Tractor starts) (Tractor revs) (Metal crunching) (Tractor revs) (Tractor driving) - So then the guy says to the waitress, well, that guy wasn't much of a man, was he? And the waitress says well, he isn't much of a truck driver either, he just ran over five motorcycles in the parking lot. What's the matter, don't you get it? What? (Phone dialing beeps) - Yeah, Eddie. Yeah, this is Zack. Listen, by any chance is my car ready yet? It is? Alright. Listen, I'll be right down to get it. Yeah. Ah, listen, Eddie... um... Look, ah... how much did you say that you paid for that dodge? - Yes, could I have Gordon Andrews' office, please? Mr. Andrews? Ah... (Laughs) Gordon, sorry. Yeah, listen, I checked this Decker guy out pretty thoroughly, and he seems to be more or less, pretty above board. There's just one other little thing I gotta look into and then I'll be able to make a full report. Yeah, well, with any luck I'll be able to be finished by tomorrow. Uh huh. Well, I'll let you know as soon as I can. Uh huh. Alright, bye. (Phone hangs up) - What was the other thing you wanted to check? - Ah, nothing much. Let's see... it's 4:30 now, today's pretty well shot. I'll have to do it tomorrow. Hey, do you play chess? - A little bit. - Would you like to play a game? - Okay. Sure. (Clearing desk) (Chess pieces poured out) - What time is it? - Ah... five thirty. Why, you gotta be someplace tonight? - Yeah. I help out with visitation at church. Would you let me know when it's 6:30? - Yeah, sure. So, you work with visitation, huh? - Yeah. It's only fair. - How's that? - Well... we visit the people who visit US. When someone new comes to the church and fills out one of those visitor cards... Well, we drop by, and... just say hello... Get to know them. Let them know that they're important to US. That our church is more than just a building. It's... People who care about other people. Hey, Zack... why don't you come with me tonight? - Ah... (Chuckles) I don't really think that's the kind of thing I'd enjoy doing. - I didn't think I'd enjoy it, either, at first. But, sometimes... I meet someone that's... Lonely... or feeling crummy... And what they really need is for someone to just say... "Hey, you're okay. You're a worthwhile person." I'll tell you, it makes their day. And I think it's neat to be able to do that. - Yeah. So... you're really involved in that church, aren't you? Check. - Well, as christians, we're supposed to be involved. I think it's in, ah, Matthew... - (Laughs) That's a Bible? - Yeah. Pretty small, isn't it? Well, it fits in my pocket a little better than a full sized one. Here it is. Matthew 25:40... "And the king will reply, 'i tell you the truth...' "'whatever you've done to the least of these brothers of mine, "'you've done it unto me.'" I guess you might say it's like... When we get involved and help people... It's as though we're doing it for Christ himself. But I guess people just don't think of it that way. (Chuckles) There's so many things to get involved in at church. There's such a big need. And there's so few people that are willing. Checkmate. (Knock at door) - Why don't you get that. (Taps desk) - (Laughs) (Door opens) - I'm looking for a Mr. Zachary. - He's inside. Come on in. - Thank you. Mr. Zachary? - Call me "Zack." Come on in and have a seat. Well, what can I do for you? - My name is Mary Springfield. (Sighs) I... really don't know how to go about saying this, so I'll just say it. I need your help. - Well, what seems to be the problem? - (Sighs) You're probably going to think I'm crazy. That's what the police think, but... I think someone's following me. - Okay, ah, what makes you think that? - Well, I can't prove it. It's just that... Well, like... when I drive somewhere, I'll see the same car behind me the whole time, and... Two days ago, someone broke into my apartment. - And what'd they take? - (Sighs) That's just it. They didn't take anything. - Well, how do you know anyone broke in? - That's what the police said. They said there was no evidence that anyone had broken in and there was nothing they could do because there was no proof that a crime had even been committed. But someone got into my apartment and searched it. Someone went through my things. I know because when I came home that night, several of my things weren't where i'd left them. They'd been moved. - Well, do you know what they were looking for? - I have no idea. - (Sighs) Well, what made you come to me? - Well, when the police said they couldn't do anything, all I could think of was a private investigator. So, I... found your name in the yellow pages, and... ...saw that you had a Christian fish on your ad, and... Well... you see... I really can't afford to hire you. I just don't have the money. And I was hoping that you might... Consider... Helping a fellow Christian... Like... (Sighs) As a favor? - Ah... Mary, look. I don't think there's anything I can do for you. I mean, you haven't given me anything to go on. Ah... Alright, look. If I can get Jeremy here to take care of my research tomorrow... I'll go take a look at your apartment and see if I can find some kind of lead. Now, I'm not going to promise you anything, and I can't spend a lot of time. - Thank you, Mr. Zachary. - Please, call me "Zack." - Thank you, Zack. - I don't know, Mary, there doesn't seem to be anything tangible. Either someone very good searched this place, or the police were right, and there's really no evidence of a break-in. What we need is some proof. Something substantial. (Knock at the door) Are you expecting anyone? - No. (Door opens) - F.b.i. Can we come in? Are you Mary Springfield? - Yes. - We'd like to ask you a few questions. - Okay. - Do you know a man named Richard Decker? - No. - Have you ever heard anyone mention his name? - Not that I know of. - Have you ever seen this man before? - No. - Thank you, miss Springfield. Sorry to trouble you. (Door opens) (Door closes) - Zack, what's going on? And why did...? (Door opens) (Door closes) - It's okay, they're gone. - Do you know Richard Decker? - No. Who is Richard Decker? - The question to ask is, "how do they know Decker?" - The f.B.I.? - (Chuckles) Those guys aren't f.B.I. - They aren't? How do you know that? - 'Cause that picture on the I.D. Card has a green background like you get at the dmv. Real f.B.I. Cards have a white background. - Well... shouldn't you go after them, or something? - (Laughs) Do you have a gun? - Of course, not. - Neither do I. They have guns. - Zack, what's going on? - That's the 64 dollar question, isn't it. I wish I knew. - What I really don't understand is why they think you have anything to do with Decker. Well, maybe Jeremy was able to find out something. Let's go back to the office and see. - (Jeremy) That is the information you wanted, isn't it? - Yeah. Pete give you any trouble? - No. But he said he's going to have to start charging you for computer time. - Yeah, he always says that. - Boy, this financial statement sure paints a different picture of Decker than the one Gordon gave me. According to this, Decker's broke. - Well, maybe he did do it, then. Maybe he did need the money. - No. Not only is he broke now, he never did have any money. At least not the kind it takes to buy property in Malibu. I don't think he could afford theproperty taxes on the place. - Well, he seems to have the insurance company convinced he has more money than he does. How did he do that? - (Zack) I don't know. But I'll bet it has something to do with those phony f.B.I. Agents. But what's the connection between Decker and Mary? - Would someone please tell me who this Richard Decker is? - He's a guy Zack's investigating for pacific southwest insurance. - You're working for p.S.I.? I used to work for them. Did I say something wrong? - I think we finally found our connection. How long did you work there? - About two years. - And when did you quit? - Last month, when I decided to go back to school full time. - And what was your job there? - I worked in the data processing department. - With computers. Here, just as I thought. This is a xerox copy of the original policy, not a computer printout. You said you worked in the data processing department. - Yeah. - Well, how hard would it be to get a computer printout of this policy? - Oh, simple. Just ask for Bob Johnson. He's head of the department. He can get it for you. - Ah... the only problem is, they might have someone working on the inside. Probably in the data processing department, since those phony f.B.I. Agents seemed to know you and not me. No, I gotta do this myself. - Could you give me the computer commands to retrieve that policy by number? - Sure, that's easy. - Here, write 'em down. Let's just hope that computer has something to tell US we don't already know. Is there another data terminal somewhere else in the building besides the data processing department? - Here. Ah... yeah, there's one in the conference room on the third floor. - And does it have a printer? - (Mary) Yeah. - (Exhales) Perfect. Jeremy, why don't you come with me? [Upbeat music] - You wait here. I should only be a few minutes. - Well, what if all the information on the printout is the same as what we already have? - Well, then we'll go with something else. But in this business, you gotta go with what you got. You never Bury a lead until it's dead. (Car door opens) (Car door closes) [Music continues] [Music ends] (Car door opens) - Well... (Car door closes) We hit the jackpot on this one. - What'd you find? - Remember when I told you Decker couldn't afford that property? -Yeah. - Well, he doesn't own it. I punched up the policy number onto the computer and I got the same building, the same location, but a different name. The policy is held by a guy named David Samuelson. And the policy isn't for 200 grand like we thought it was. Are you ready for this? Try 1.3 million. - Wow. What does it all mean, Zack? - Well, that part I haven't figured out yet. But I know it's gonna start to make a whole lot more sense once I find out who this David Samuelson is. - How do we do that? - That, my friend, is what private investigation is all about. - (Laughs) Zack, hold it. - What? - You see that car over there? - Which one? - The white riviera - yeah. - Remember last Wednesday when we were driving around, asking all those people questions? - Yeah, why? - I saw that car three times that day, in three different places. Always where we were asking people questions. - Nah. There's a lot of white rivieras around. - No, same license plate. - How do you know that? - Well, it's a game I play with, ah, license numbers. I make up words to go along with the letters, and... I remember that car because I couldn't think of anything to go with x x v, and... And then I remembered that... that was Roman numerals for 25, and that was Wednesday's date: The 25th. And then I kept seeing it. - (Zack) Okay, let's see if we can make the pieces fit. Richard Decker goes to the insurance company and takes out a 200 thousand dollar policy on his building in Malibu. - (Jeremy) But he doesn't own it. This David Samuelson does. - I'm getting to that part. But he's gotta make the insurance company believe he does. So he fakes up some financial statements. - How does he do that? - I'm not sure. But let's just say that he figures out a way. Then he burns the building down. Now, he'd probably have to hire a professional arsonist to make it look like an accident. Okay. Now the insurance company decides to pay off on the policy. Who gets the money? - This Samuelson guy. - Right. Which means Decker is a front. Now, they'd have to get somebody respectable. Somebody... Who wouldn't have any motive for arson. Someone without things like, ah... Gambling debts. Someone who could survive an investigation. Mary, how good is communication between departments at that company? - What do you mean? - Ah, well, do people from one department know what's going on in another? - Ah, well, it's a very big company. I'm... I'm sure communication isn't perfect. That's why they have the central computer, so all the information can be accessed by any department. - Okay. Now suppose this Decker, or whoever he's fronting for, has someone inside the company... In the data processing department, that changes the information in the computer. Now I deliver a report that says Decker's clean. The claims adjuster authorizes payment on the policy, the authorization goes to the accounting department. Now the accounting department punches in the policy number. They don't know it's been changed. They pay the amount listed to the name listed. Samuelson gets 1.3 million bucks. - Which brings US right back to the question, "who is David Samuelson?" - Well, that's what we're gonna find out. I hope you like making phone calls, 'cause we're gonna make a ton of 'em tomorrow. - (Zack) Yeah, I see. Okay, Pete, thanks. Bye. (Phone hangs up) - (Jeremy) Okay. Well, thanks anyway. (Phone slides shut) - Any luck? - Nah. He hasn't heard of him either. - Boy, this is really weird. This David Samuelson's got a house, he's got a credit rating... He bought a car, a boat, a plane, real estate, and nobody's ever met him. It's like he doesn't exist. - Is there anyone else to call? - Nah, I'm tapped out. I think we've called everyone I can think of. - Well, what do we do? - (Chuckles) Give me a little time. I'll think of something. - Is it alright if I take off. I still have to finish my lesson for Sunday, and I thought I'd do it now, if you don't need me. - What lesson's that? - I teach a third grade Sunday school class at church. - You sure spend a lot of time at that church. - It's not that much. I do what I can. - How do you find the time? - Well that's the really funny thing about it. Well, it's not really funny, but it's interesting the way it all works out. I used to never seem to have enough time for everything. I was trying to pack 25 hours of stuff into one day. And then about a year ago, I was talking with our youth pastor, and he really challenged me to get involved. So I started doing things at our church, and the really amazing thing is, I'm doing more things now than I was a year ago, but yet I seem to have more free time. It's really true. God does multiply back to US what we give to him. - You sound like you'd make a good pastor. - (Laughs) I don't know. You don't need to be a pastor to get involved. - You really enjoy helping out at that church, don't you. - Well, it's not always fun, if that's what you mean. Sometimes it's just work. Hard work. But it's always worth it. You know, the only way we can be... Satisfied as people, is to be doing the things god wants US to do. And... one of those things is just... Being involved at our own church. (Knock at the door) - I'll get it. (Door opens) - F.b.i. This is agent Walker. I'm agent Turner. May we come in? - Sure. - It's okay, Jeremy. These guys are the real thing. So, what can I do for you two gentlemen? - Are you John Zachary? - All my life. - We understand you've been making inquiries about a David Samuelson. - (Chuckles) Boy, word sure travels fast. - We'd like to know who he is. - You'd like to know who he is... I'd like to know who he is. - Then you don't know. - Do you? Mr. Zachary, just what is your interest in Samuelson? - Well, I'm working on an insurance investigation, and I believe he's involved in some kind of computer fraud. - It fits. - What fits? Who is this Samuelson guy? - He's a "paper man." - Alright... I'll bite. What's a "paper man?" - He's just a name in a computer. - What he's trying to say is someone has managed to create a whole computer file on this Samuelson. He buys, sells, conducts business. Even pays taxes. But it's all on paper. The person doesn't really exist. At least, not flesh and blood. - Why? What's the point? - Have you ever tried to prosecute a computer? - You see, somebody is committing a lot of white collar crime, using this paper man as a cover. - We've been on his trail for almost a year now. And we have enough evidence to put him away for a long time. But we need a body to pin it on. - We were hoping you could help US. - I'll bet he owns a white riviera. - How did you know that? - (Chuckles) Have a seat, gentlemen. I'll tell you everything I know. Well, when I found out that the name on the policy wasn't Decker's, but was Samuelson's, I started to try to find out who he was. - So you think Samuelson could be connected to someone at the insurance company. - (Zack) It looks that way. - Any ideas who? - (Zack) Well... I'm not sure. But it might be possible to get him to admit it. Um... but the confession would probably not be admissible in court. - I'm sure we have enough hard evidence to get a conviction even without a confession. If we know who, I'm sure we can make the connection. - Well, in that case, gentlemen... (Claps hands together) I have a plan. - (Zack) Working late? - Mr. Zachary. - Evening. - (Gordon) Is that the report? - This? Nah. Afraid not. - Have you finished your report? - Not yet. - (Gordon) Mr. Zachary, we are paying you by the day for this investigation. What seems to be the problem? - No problem. I just thought you might like to hear what I had to report before I officially filed it. - I'm listening. - Ya know, I really must admit you had me going there for a while. I mean, it's a very well thought out plan. I especially liked the part about the two fake f.B.I. Agents. Now that was a nice touch. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about your plan to rip-off your own insurance company. - If this is some sort of a joke... - No joke. - David Samuelson. - Who's that? (Zack chuckles) - He's you. Or, you're him, depending on which way you want to look at it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Well, that's funny. (Papers hit desk) Your computer seems to know about it. - Where did you get this? - Let's just say I got it. - You obviously want something, or you would have gone to the police. - Not that is a very good deduction. See, I knew you were smart. - 'Ya see, I happen to think that 1.3 million dollars is an awful lot of money, and I think there's plenty to go around. - (Gordon) How much? - Pardon? - How much do you want? - Half. - Half? You're out of your mind. No way are you going to get half. - Now, before you make such a rash decision, let's consider the alternatives. If you give me half, then you can only afford a 40 foot yacht instead of a 60 foot yacht, but if you don't give me half, then I go to the feds, and you get a nice prison term, and, of course, no money. Now I really think that the decision is a rather simple one. - That's blackmail! - How 'bout that? - Okay. Half. - 'Ya know, this is gonna come probably as a big disappointment to you, but I really don't want your money. But... I do have a couple of friends who do. They're with the f.B.I. And they're listening. Right now. - F.b.i. You're under arrest. Read him his rights. - You have the right to remain silent. If you give up your right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of - (Zack) Yeah, well, that's good to know. Yeah. Hey, well, listen, thanks for calling. Uh huh. Yeah, bye. (Phone hangs up) (Zack) Well, that was agent Turner, from the f.B.I. Seems that Gordon Andrews made a full confession, and he even named three accomplices. Looks like he's gonna be singing the "prison blues" for a long time. - (Mary) What I don't understand is, how did you know is was Mr. Andrews? - Well, I didn't. At least, not for sure. But you see, he didn't know I didn't know. - Huh? - (Chuckles) Well, when I got the computer printout, and it didn't match up with the original policy, I knew that it had to be somebody at the insurance company. And then when Jeremy spotted that riviera following US, I remembered something that Andrews' secretary said about Andrews owning a riviera. And then it just became a matter of getting him to admit it. - So he bluffed him. - More or less. - Well, I bet the insurance company was pleased with the results. - (Jeremy) You bet they were. They gave Zack a one percent recovery fee. That's thirteen thousand dollars. - Wow. - Now you can afford to buy another one of those pink cars. (Mary laughs) - Ah... (Chuckles) No, seriously, Zack, I want to thank you for letting me get involved in this case. It was really good experience for me. - (Zack) 'Ya know, I really should be, ah... thanking you. - (Jeremy) Why? I didn't really do anything. - I'm not talking about the case. (Takes a breath) (Exhales) I'm talking about the things that you've been saying to me all week about getting involved at the church. You've, ah... helped me realize some things that... ah, I don't know, I guess I never thought much about it. I guess I never really thought getting involved at the church was all that important. (Chuckles) 'Ya know, I... I see people who are so much more talented than I am, who have so much more to offer... I kinda figured they could do a better job than I could, you know, that I wasn't really needed. 'Ya know, someone else would do it. But, lately... I'm beginning to see that there's a lot of things I could be doing down there. (Laughs) After all, it doesn't really take a doctorate in theology to paint a wall, or go on a visitation. For that matter, it doesn't take a college degree to teach a third grade Sunday school class. I guess I never realized the benefits of getting involved. And, uh... well it was your attitude that started me to thinking. You've got, ah... a real purpose, and, ah,satisfaction in your work at the church. And, ah... well, I guess I've been missing that. (Chuckles) You know, there's a lot of good things for christians to get involved in. So often we overlook one of the most important that's right under our nose. Our own church. (Knock at door) -(Pastor) Hi, Zack. Am I interrupting anything? - Oh, no. Come on in, pastor. I just want to thank you for volunteering for that work day tomorrow. - I'm looking forward to it. - Good. We should have a pretty good turnout. - (Zack) Yeah, I hope so. - Yeah, we're gonna have a good time tomorrow. See you at 9:00 am sharp. - Nine sharp. - Oh, I almost forgot. I've got great news. Looks like we'll finally be able to finish the roof on that old building. Someone gave US an annonymous donation of thirteen thousand dollars. See 'ya, Zack. (Taps on desk) - (Nervous chuckle) What are you two looking at? Ah... Ah, Mary. Ah... in, ah, all this confusion and distraction of the case, I haven't really had a chance to get to know you. And... I was just wondering if I could buy you dinner sometime. - Sure. When? - How about now? - Okay. - After you. Oh, ah... Jeremy? (Keys jingle) Lock up when you leave. [Musical tag]
