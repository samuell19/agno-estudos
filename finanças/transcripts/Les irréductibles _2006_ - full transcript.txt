LATE GRADUATES There's a mistake! Isn't this the VSA factory? Sign here, I don't have all day. It's full of knots. Take it back! -I have to reload in an hour! -Not my problem. Wait up. Just write: "Needs approval." That'll do. "Not compliant." -Fifth bad batch this month. -Junk again? Moreau's a pain. Where does he get his supplies? I'm done! Go ahead! Hi, you've reached Philippe. Leave a message. Bye. -Créa'tifs, good morning! -Micheline? Michel, here. I'll put her on. Claire! Claire! Michel... -Hello? -So? -He didn't get it. -Shit! -How about the retakes? -Neither. -Did he fail by much? -No. -How is he taking it? -Not too badly. Well... He'll get it next year. He'd better. We'll talk tonight. It's busy here. Love you. They failed him! You must be disappointed, poor dear. No need to. Some misfortunes make you grow. Come here, Kiki. Come with us. I know, Jean-Pierre, but that's the way it is. Let's keep our cool. Let's help each other. We won't let them screw us over. Don't worry. -What rotten luck! -You said it! -I wasn't expecting it. -We neither. Not even retakes! -And he did cram! -They say we're not productive. -What do you mean? -And you? His finals! Philippe flunked! Today's not your day, pal. Thanks. Okay, I failed. It's not the end of the world. The factory will shut down in two months. Dad lost his job. Hi! Hey, guys! What's up? The lawyer says the negotiations are tough. He says that each time. He too thinks we're idiots. Now the HQ is in Hungary, it complicates things. If it were easy, we wouldn't need a lawyer! It's a question of months. -How many? -I don't know... 18, maybe 24. -Damn! Two years! -We won't make it. Technocom signed in 6 months. They had 850 employees. Bompart had 30. They got nothing. But the union's supporting us! One or one thousand, it's the same! I made the schedule. Monday and Tuesday: Nadine, Abdel, Antoine, Gérard and Michel. We won't make it. I won't. Everyone can choose for himself. What will you do? I don't know, but I won't make it. -What about the strike? -We're not on strike! -We're unemployed. -Then, we're doomed. Louis, think about it. They planned it all. Moreau vanished the day we were fired. If they wanted their machines, they'd take them. Our butts sitting on them won't change anything. Our mobilization will make our voices heard. Gérard! Group action is nothing new to you. "Group action"? That needs to build up through training. We've never been on strike. -Who's taking Tuesday? -I will. What's he doing here? -What can I do? -What you can do is... take your food back and get out! You know, Louis, I was duped, too, just like you. You were? Right, the director's always the last one to know. With an early retirement two months prior? -Don't make me laugh. -Who're you fighting, Louis? Michel, you said it yourself: "They planned it all." You know how much he pocketed to leave? At least the VSA shareholders won't get their claws on that. -Shall we scram? -Yeah, right. Scram! -We'll get our severance bonus. -Sure. Come on, Edmond. ON STRIKE -He's right, that money is... -Yours. Don't be ashamed. Use it to have a good time. Travel to Mexico, Canada... I'm retired, not rich. Gardening, fishing? I'm not an old fart! Then, come, ride with us. -No, I quit cycling. -All right. -We must go back to the factory. -It's in the other direction. We need to fight them, make them knuckle under. They treated us like cow dung. Justice will rule in your favor. They'll drag it on for years. Meanwhile, they'll invest the money they owe us. Damn, we exist! Even without them! You're right, Mimi. I'm not sure how, but you are. -How's it going, Ed? -Great. -Tomorrow: same time, same spot. -Tomorrow? Sure, no problem. He's good, isn't he? -You have a college education? -It's only to sell shoes. Look: "Two years of college." -I didn't see. Wait, I'll help you sort out. High school degree, certificates, college... Ah, there we go... "Qualified worker." Oh, no, it's accounting. That's me. Hi. -I was in quality control. -Very well. -What field? -Barrels. -Ah... -What? Barrels are very technical. You have to calibrate staves, raise the barrels, toast them... Cute expressions anyway. -Have you got degrees? -My know-how needs no degree. I worked in the same company for almost 20 years. For now, write a presentation letter: your work experience, work ambitions... We'll discuss those next time. How about a job for right now? I think I may have something for you. Come on, Michel! Tackle them! Go for it! Play defense! Team action! France-Ireland, 1984! When meat comes off the bone, they say it's overcooked... But they're born like that. It's full. Don't worry about it. Wasn't it easier when they were raised in cages? Battery farms don't exist anymore. That's too cruel. -Philippe! Hurry up. -Coming! -So, how was it? -Great. Something smells good. -You didn't bring any home? -Only croissants. Much better. I have to go now. Philippe is still upstairs. Something smells funny... -I'll go get him. -And I'll make coffee. -Ciao, ciao. -Bye, Claire. -What're you doing? -Getting dressed! -You've got half an hour left! -Chill out, it's under control. What's that smell? You'd better get a grip. Don't let failure stop you. Philosophy's a pain. Tuesday: 2 hours of math, 1 of biology. Oh, yeah... It's all good. I have last year's notes. That's why it's no good. -Do you take drugs? -Dad, get off my back. -What're you doing? -And you? Is this what you spend time on? Watch out, damn! It's fragile. Give it back, I'm of age. Right, you're of age, but you live under my roof. No more fooling around. You'll pass the exams! I'm positive! "Positive"? What planet are you from? A high school degree's nothing. Then, get it. If you don't, then you're a nothing. Male worker in his prime, very motivated... We know that, it's a motivation letter. -I shouldn't put it? -Put it if you want. Make up your mind. What should I put, then? What have you got over others? -Tons of things. -Yes. Plus, you have ideas. True! -I think that... -"I'm sure!" -I think that... -"I'm sure!" -I'm sure... that I think... -"I'm sure!" Be affirmative. Male worker... in his forties, 20 years of experience... in his prime, very motivated. -What do you think? -Me? Not much. It's good, Michel. Very good. However... You need to practice every day, otherwise it hurts. Not today, I'm in up to my eyes. Look... You wrote "in his forties." -Put your exact age. -My birth date on my résumé. And here... "20 years of experience..." Got your red wine? It's "professional experience." -This is Louis' résumé. -Don't make a mess, Gérard. That's the whole factory. What are you doing? I answer job ads. You do? And do they know about it? Look. I couldn't just stand by. -What if they're called in? -If they're called in... See? Rigor, organization and method! One, I enter the data. Two, there are several columns: what I send, to whom, the date and replies. Three, if I land an appointment, I phone them up. I pretend I'm from the employment office. -All right, I see. -Any replies yet? The process is in the works. -Did you find the place easily? -Yes, without difficulty. I like this place a lot. It's nice. Thanks. So you're in banking? I run a small branch office, seven employees, interesting clientele. I have a fulfilling profession. To me, it's all about human contact, quality advice... I give it my all. So, you see, my field doesn't leave me time for women. Of course... Good evening, Gérard. Good evening, Miss. Good evening... You know each other? -Not at all. -Want a drawing? -No, thank you. -10 euros. Have a nice evening. -I'd like a drink. -What would you like? -A Red October. -Like the Sean Connery movie? No, like the cocktail. With a glass. Can I have two Red Octobers? -Right away. -Thanks. That's because of the bank... Everyone hates bankers. -He screwed around last year. -You think so? We're not exactly intellectuals. What does that even mean? It means nothing. At his age, I only thought about the finals. Not quite, Michel. Excuse me. -Michel, tomorrow is Sunday. -So? -Are you all right? -Yes. It hurts... -Where? -Here. Designer? That's a tad pretentious. Car designer... Now, that's not bad. Artistic, but not too much. This is the life, innit? It beats chasing chickens. This suits me fine. A sabbatical with unemployment. A few odd jobs, once in a while. Makes time to try something new. We must move on and retrain. Nonsense. Our kids will have several jobs in their lifetime. Training classes are a dime a dozen. Trainings won't make us cheaper for management. They must protect the dividends! If we don't help ourselves, nobody will. -Hello. -Hello. Excuse me. I brought my motivation letter. Your colleague said... -I'm listening. -I saw an ad... Number 1264. 12-64... Quality control technician, bottling company... That's not your profile. Filling bottles is no high-tech. Don't you think I'll manage? I don't know. To you, bottles and barrels are of the same kind? At least send my application or tell me what factory it is. That's confidential. They want a high school degree. You don't have it. It won't do. I made it to the senior year. "Degree" and "senior year," that's different. Plus, everyone has a degree now. It's a minimum requirement. Even that is no guarantee people can read and write. You can read and write, correct? Wait... Here, I found it! Warehouseman in Agen! Great, that's only 100 km away. The wages'll just cover the gas. Thank you, ma'am. Goodbye. I must respect their criteria. If I don't, the whole system will fail. What do I have to do? To fit into the little boxes of your stupid system! Sir, don't do that. Please. No, sir, please. -Answer me! -Stay calm. -I need a high school degree? -Yes. Everyone has it, right? Are you nuts? Asshole! -Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm all right. -Are you sure? -Yeah, yeah. I make the system fail. It's me... I'm the one making the system fail... Listen to me, Mimi, I'm not taking your silly exams. Hey, guys, I'm going to take them with you. When you say "you," you mean you two, because I... -Did you see the curriculum? -Vaguely. This is not right. You don't vaguely take exams! Rigor, organization and method. That's the basis of everything. Just in case... How would we go about it? By going back to school. Mimi, look at us. We haven't been to school in 20 years! Yeah, me too, going to school... I'm not sure. Too much commotion and noise to be able to concentrate. Too many youngsters! -School will force us to work. -I thought you hated school. I'm in, but I'll need a hand. This'll get Philippe a kick in the ass. We're in deep shit. -Corporal punishment is back on. -Lay off! I'm as anxious as when I was twelve. -Pavlov... It's a reflex. -Don't show off! I have a stomach cramp. -It'd stimulate our pupils. -Thank you. Nevertheless... A pupil's parent in a classroom might be viewed as provocation by some teachers. So you're saying no? Mr. Mathias isn't a pupil's parent. Granting one of you permission is a favor. But with the two of you, it'd be an experimental program! I don't believe it! All that just to spy on me! We'll study together! And we'll get it! I promise! -But Michel! At your age? -You see? -Your father's trying to help. -This is a mad house! I'm gonna scram. Screw my degree. Shock therapy was a good idea, but it backfired. -I'd get a better job with it. -Michel, be realistic. I've got the ability. I almost got it. You almost took it... There's a difference. -We can't lose that game! -Some don't do their jobs. -Two essays! -Because we have no defense. Doesn't the teacher use the blackboard? No. -How do we do it then? -I can give you my notes. No, I'll ask Philippe. How do you feel about the finals? Fine, but I need to pass with honors. But this is quite overwhelming. This whole curriculum in such a short time... It's not so bad. It's only 800 points. You need a strategy. Focus on your strong subjects and juggle the coeffs. Take some more time to re-read the excerpt. I think it may be useful. What is the essential theme of this passage? IS FREEDOM BUT AN ILLUSION? Lucie? Bergson says... that social rules... are more important than individual consciousness. Not exactly, no. It's not about consciousness. Yes? -Bergson says that... -Be quiet! Continue. -We're imprisoned... -No, you've misinterpreted. For Bergson, society guarantees... -Your Dad's super sexy. -You want a date? I mean, compared to mine. You know, for an old man. Write a commentary on this text for next time. What an idler! She gave us the same assignment last year. -Did you keep it? -That depends... maybe. Let's go. I can't deal with my Dad all day long. Don't skip class because of him. He's only here to embarrass me. "Embarrass you"? Hold up, my old man's only ambition in life is to watch the morning show! Come on! Give me a break! Hello. Michel Deschamps, Gérard Mathias. -The principal... -Yes, I know. Go sit down. -Hello, I'm Michel... -Yes, I know. Sit. Come on, everyone, hurry! Apparently, it's either the father or the son? Let's go back to progressive mechanical waves. We saw earlier that waves do not only propagate in one-dimensional environments, like a string, but in two-dimensional environments such as liquid surfaces. I'll let you get the diagram. MAX LINDER HIGH SCHOOL -How did it go? -We have learning deficiencies, which must be viewed in relation to the scope of our assets. -It's all nonsense. -Is it serious? Whatever. It's only 800 points. A matter of strategy, and juggling the coeffs. And what about electrons? Did they figure out whether they're matter particles or vibrations? Micheline? What if we changed the pictures in the shop? What for? For a change! Do you like this? We're not Guy and Tony! -Hello, Micheline! -Hello, Mrs. Lacaze. -Hello. -Hello, Claire. Am I late? I was held up. -How's business for you? -Okay. We're better off than some. -What'll it be today? -Oh, the usual. Ready for your hair exam? Here we go! -How's the temperature? -Fine. Créa'tifs, hello. I'll add some cold water. Yes, I'm his mother. No, he had no reason... I understand. Thank you for letting me know. Goodbye. Tell me, Claire, did your husband find some work? Yes, but it's only temporary. Would you like dessert? Did you design the new Carminat? We were a team. Right, but there must be something that was all yours? Erm, yes... the blinkers. I can't delude myself, I need to catch up. But the atmosphere at school is challenging. And Philippe? Frankly, it's going rather well. Frankly? Are you making fun of me? The principal called. He's been going on and off for 2 weeks. You didn't know? Maybe you couldn't know. Are you even going yourself? Why would you think that? Now, that's reassuring. Claire! He skipped school, no big deal. "No big deal"? Nothing's a big deal! -I'll give him my notes. -"You'll give him your notes"? Is that your great plan for him to succeed? I don't believe it! What's for dinner? -Did you do your homework? -And you? -Are we going to your place? -Now? We hardly know each other. So? You don't chat online to find Cinderella, do you? With me, it's up front! You pay for dinner, you do me. No hassle. But I don't want to "do" you. Whatever. You're still paying for dinner. A nut! You wouldn't believe what she did! -At least you had fun. -Not with a chick like that. You know me, I'm the physical type. Being tied up between a radiator and the fireplace... How's that any fun, you know? I know you're faking it this morning. You're pretending to pedal! Come on! Put your papers and pens down, for those of you who have one. -Goodbye. -Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thanks. Thank you. You're not taking mine? I don't have to correct a paper from someone auditing my class. You'd rather I did, perhaps? No, don't leave. There. Thanks... Not at all. All right, I wrote it down. Thank you, goodbye. -A job interview for Nadine! -Edmond, your plan's working. -No way! -It is. I knew it! You need method! Rigor and method. Let Nadine know! -I'll call her! -No, I'll do it. -You like it? Some hairspray? -No, thanks. So, Michel's back in high school? No, it's my son, Philippe. No, it's Michel, I assure you. I believe I know my son's name. Michel is my husband. Goodbye. I know. It's in the papers. UNEMPLOYED, BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL -Funny, huh? -That's the word, indeed. Who's taking the exams? Kant! 1785. -81... Not far off. -How did you know that? I don't, I got it wrong. Your turn. Five. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. -White. -Economy. -Definition of "added value"? -Not in the curriculum. Do you want to cram? Added value is... the value added... to raw materials to make finished products. Not bad. Actually, it's the result of a company's production, measured by the difference between selling prices and intermediate costs... like... -Salaries? -Correct! -Your turn, Gérard. -Forget it. -Gérard! -Gérard! Three. -Three. Pink. What's pink? -History. Which president abolished the death penalty in France? -Mitterrand. -What year? 1981. See? -How did you know? -The first time I voted. -Michel's go. -And you? Come on, Edmond. It's your turn! Come on! He won't play... -White. -What's white? Economy. Definition of GDP? The amount reached by valuing a country's productive activity. Bravo! Of course, he wrote the questions... It isn't Trivial Pursuit, it's an Alzheimer's test! We're good. Quite good! -In economy. -But we signed up for science. Economy is part of social economics. -Then we'll do that. -We're too weak in physics. How about natural sciences? So we can stay with Philippe. What's your goal, to pass or to bug your kid? It gives him pep! I must hang in there, just for him. Who are you talking about? Philippe? Philippe Deschamps? The studious and grateful young man? Well... Who am I to say? I know nothing about kids. Actually, we complain about a society that imposes rules but we couldn't do without them. For example, victims of social exclusion are not content! Nietzsche opposed Bergson saying that without singularity, individuals are lost in the masses. Normalcy lacks depth. It's reassuring to know we all have the same goal. Opposing normalization begets violence. In the end, we do it all to be loved. Together you'd make an excellent philosopher! The last two rows... Give me your work as you leave. -Something else? -That's all. 16.70 euros. Denied. You want to try again or pay cash? I don't get it. -Can I pay tomorrow? -Tomorrow's fine. Jacques, bring this to the cold room, please. Don't worry, we'll keep it aside for you. -You're off to an awful start. -Am I that bad? Give me this... y = 2ax + b? School curriculums have changed a bunch... Hello, my love. What's wrong? What happened? It's the unemployment money... Usually it's sent to the account before the mortgage payment. It's computerized. It's a matter of days. -You'll call tomorrow? -Yes. Single, 38 years old... former rugby player, now working in insurance... seeks 30 to 40-year-old woman. Not bad. Single, 38 years old... former rugby player now working in insurance. Not bad, huh? "Rugby player." What do you think? Hello? Welcome, Gérard YOU HAVE 7 MESSAGES Yes, what is it, Mr. Deschamps? Isn't it: y = 2ax + b? -You're rotten! -Don't make us waste our time. I wouldn't if you explained. Sure. Curves and straight lines are all the same to you. Won't you stop taking him for an idiot? Gentlemen, you owe me respect! Respect is earned. Fuck you! -Would you go outside? -Who do you think you are? What do you think? That your degrees allow you to make fun of me? You received an education! I worked in a factory, but I have the right to one! Come on, let's go! The unions will get on my back. You know what an indefinite strike notice is? And the parents... They only care about the finals and delayed revision! And my superiors, you know what they'll say? I told you it was nonsense. Come on, Mimi. Some stupid teacher won't ruin your stupid exam for you! -Science, social economics, SMS? -No... Yes, I swear. It exists, look. -Economics, it's better. -Yes. Economics... -Is that all? -Wait... -No, it doesn't work! -Wait! -It doesn't work. -Leave it alone. There. Go on, push "Enter." There. Registration validated. And you, Gérard? Right. It doesn't commit me to anything. -You must find our curriculum. -How do I find it? -Figure it out. -We can't back down now. Every morning, you come here at 8:30, deal? Saturdays also. How about days off? You'll be off new subjects. And onto revision. -He wasn't with you? -Not since the last math class. This wouldn't be happening if you had passed last year! -Good evening. -Where were you? At Edmond's. Good evening. Did you call the unemployment office? -I had other things on my mind. -Are you kidding me? We're in the red. The mortgage payment was denied. -What game are you playing? -I'm not playing. It's time my work were respected. "Your work"? You should get a real job. Quit fantasizing! "Canceled due to lack of search for employment." You open my mail now? Let it be clear, I won't repeat myself: I'm taking the finals, at any cost. -"At any price"? -You heard me. -Some Lucie called. Who's she? -A girl from school. -Good evening, madam. -Good evening. Gérard? Hello, I'm... -Laurence? -Late. Pleased to meet you. Some wine? Yes? I like this place a lot. At least here you can... have dinner... At least you eat well. I mean, compared to other places. Anyway... You got them in a duty free shop? Across the street. I don't smoke much. Ready to order? Laurence? Good grief, how stupid of me! What? What is it? Stewardess, uniform... Diet! Duck confit... with a salad. -Thank you. -The same for me. -With potatoes. -Very well. -A toast! -Cheers! Elements that allow... I know! They allow to improve production methods and increase productivity. -Yes, that's it. -Yeah, it's clear. Technical progress... the automated tapering of staves in 1988: 5 jobs gone. Innovation... synthetic corks. No more noise when opening a bottle, to make you thirsty. And the factories shut down in silence as well. Question of geography. How's Michel? You see him more than I do now. He's really committed to it, you know? It's so irresponsible. I'm fed up! I understand he needs a change of air, but they're only asking him to look for a job! To look! Maybe his degree's more important. More important than his family, than his home? We made our choices together. -How can he drop everything? -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. So, Mrs. Deschamps, is the husband still at school? -This feels weird, right? Huh? -Yeah. Yeah! -It'll take hours. -I know, but 148.50 euros! Why wouldn't you let me buy the books? -What are you doing here? -Can't you see? Aren't you at school? -We're self-taught. -You've got some nerve. The machines are here for those who fought for them. Wanna do it? Making fun of me? I didn't mean the photocopiers. Dammit, guys. You think you're too good to go on strike? What do you think? You'll become a boss with a degree? Freedom means you get to choose your troubles. It's true. We don't bother jerks who climb an oxygen-deprived Everest. At least, we hold out. A few of us have found a job. In a way, good for them. -And you, you're not looking? -I got two agency interviews. That's all. Come to think of it, they haven't called in a while. -It's the slow season. -Really? You think so? Really? Thanks. Hey, Louis! "You made promises, but we haven't seen nothing." That's incorrect. "We haven't seen nothing"? It's "We haven't seen anything." No double negations... Oh, right. Thanks, guys. -Thank you. Enjoy the holidays. -Goodbye. -Hello. -Hello. -I'd like to return these. -Certainly. Michel, sign this, it's your unemployment file. -Show up with your file today. -No. We're three months late on our mortgage payments. I'm not going back there without my degree. What if you fail? That's no good, the roots show. -Isn't it trendy? -"Trendy"? -Sure! -No, it's not, and that's final! -Are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine. Would I look good with this? Yes, but I'd go a bit shorter to soften your face. -Shall we try it? -All right. -Breakup or new love? -I first have to dump a clinger. -I see. -You too? -Sometimes I wonder. -Some day, it'll become clear. Hello? Good evening, Laurence. Oh... Why not? Yes, I understand. Fog in London... It could happen to anyone. No, don't worry. Goodbye. -Hello, sweet pea. -Hi, Mom. Here. -What's this? -Didn't you hear it's Christmas? Thank you. -Where did you get all this? -I bought it. -With what? -I made dough with my drawings. "Drawings"? -Does it bug you I'm talented? -Not at all. You show off with your presents... but that's not being independent. Washout ambitions are fine if Mom and Dad fill the fridge, pay your clothes, your mobile... It's more Mom than Dad now. -Michel, are you nuts? -What a jerk! Go to your room before I give you one! You can't treat him like that. What have we done to you? I think you should leave now, Michel. We'll get by without you. Mimi, you're here. Merry Christmas, Mimi! You're not doing too well, huh? -It's nice of you to have come. -Yeah... You think it's funny I'm taking my finals? Not quite, I assure you. Then give me a student loan. That loan is for young people who are starting out, a nudge in the right direction. Your circumstances are different. But I prepared a 12,000-euro loan over 24 months. Like a credit line. Credit? I have an overdraft! I don't have any credit. Not a problem with your house as a guarantee. The answer's no. -I won't give you my house. -Consider it while there's time. Gérard? Can you find something for me online? -You're an insurance agent now? -I know, it's ridiculous. What should I put? -Student! -You think? -Too late. She won't call back. -Why not? 76% of women value honesty. I read it in Marie-Claire. -And I don't feel like it. -Are you in love? -We had dinner once. -Don't let this slip past. How do you think couples make it? They talk, they listen. Do you miss Claire? -Will you do my search? -Sure. Sweetie, time to get up. I like your work. I wanted to tell you, Philippe, the issues your dad and I have shouldn't disrupt your studies. All right? -Are you getting a divorce? -No. -Mom, I want to be an artist. -That's good. I'm talented. But the world will have to wait a few more months. Don't worry, talent doesn't slip away. I don't care how you do it, but you pass your finals. Please. Then, you won't have to get back to it in 20 years. A gamble on the future. I went to the post office. I got your parcel! Excellent! -Time to eat. -At last, valid corrections. -Oh, yeah? -Look. Take your pill. Jeanne, it makes me sleepy. -Here. -No water. As you like. What movie is this? Are we watching TV? It's serious: four assignments with grades in a week. Amazing! How much did your educational program cost? It's paid for. "Paid for"? Edmond... Are you messing with me? I might be flat broke, but I'm not a little boy. -I asked you how much it cost. -650 euros. What? Fuck me! What are you trying to buy? Our friendship? Your guilt? Can you tell when we misread an economy text? Or if we're off the point in a history essay? Michel, are we taking these finals or are we not? I'm sick of your superior airs! You're not the boss anymore! -Michel! -He's gone overboard. I can't accept this. These corrections will help him a great deal. Don't let him down. -Yes! -Shit! Where did you get that accent? I studied English in Rome for three years. You did? And? I had an Italian boyfriend back then, so university was... But you did get your degree... I got pregnant, didn't keep it, and then I got my degree. -Because of your studies? -No, because of my Italian. I don't know what that means, but it must've been worth it. Good evening, Laurence. I was afraid you wouldn't come. Good evening. It's just a meal, no commitment involved. Are you angry? You're right, I ruined your Christmas Eve. Maybe you were better off. No, no... Don't be racked with remorse. I wanted to talk and see if... I could make it up. It's not you, it was my husband. -"Your husband"? -Ex-husband, we're divorcing. -My little girl was supposed... -You have a daughter? I take it... You're not a stewardess, right? Good, I'm not an insurance agent. I made barrels. The factory closed, I've been unemployed for six months. Excuse me, that's not funny. I love your new hairdo. Thanks. -Is everything all right? -Philippe didn't come home. His phone's turned off. He's a big boy. If it makes you feel any better, he's in Angoulême. Who's she? Lucie. She's my math teacher, she's giving me lessons. I see. What's he doing there? He went to try and get a contract, I mean, for his comic strip. -So what do we do? -Nothing. I won't drag his ass home. I've got my math homework. -Where were you? -I'm beat, I'm off to bed. -I want an explanation! -There's nothing to explain. If there's nothing to explain... This is your first exam in real conditions. In case you succeed, don't rest on your laurels. If you fail, don't get discouraged. It's time. He didn't come home, last tonight. -Let's do it tomorrow. -He won't be back tomorrow. Excellent! FOR SALE What are you doing, Mom? -Are you insane? -Why? -It's too big for me. -What about me? Do you live here? Everyone does his own thing. There's nothing left. No life, no love anymore. We didn't talk much, but I thought we were happy. If you want to ruin it all, let's go for it! My friends have gone back to high school. Really? That's terrific. I don't know, maybe it's a way of burying their head in the sand. What'll they do afterwards? And you, what do you want to do? Wait a second! Hey, kids! Kids! Give me the ball! I've been watching you, and this is dull. Let's play. Navy blue against blue-white. Ten minutes. No more, deal? Short passes. No tackles, you touch and pass the ball, all right? Got it? -I'm sorry... -Well, they're listening. -No problem. -Gérard Mathias. I don't know rugby, I teach judo. Really? Four kids signed up for judo and 18 for rugby, so the mayor decided it was rugby for all. What's wrong, sweetie? Are you thirsty? Want to come back next week? -Maybe, I don't know. -I'll be waiting for you. -Come on, Alice! Show them! -Back to starting position. Go! What are you doing? I'm going through my mom's old stuff. Hurry up, we're late! Don't wait, I'm not coming. Who cares about the practice test? Michel, I am not coming. We're buddies, but you're getting on my nerves. I'm tired of listening to you and your dumb ideas. I don't care about degrees. I don't have one, never will and I don't give a crap! It's important... -what we did together. -"Important"? For whom? You really think we're together? We're together out of habit, like at the factory. How do you like this? I don't know. I don't have an opinion. I think it's a good idea. I need a degree to go into Fine Arts. Then, you'll get it. -So? -I was waiting for you. Show me. Let me see. Well, you failed English and economics. The rest is honorable. Philosophy: 9. History: 10. Economics: "Too many examples that lead to no conclusions." You're missing one point, one tiny point. On the average! -That makes forty. -At least you can count. You have three minutes to state your problem. I'd like to coach the kids who signed up for rugby. Oh. You know, we already have a coach. -He's a judo teacher. -You're a rugby teacher? -I had a short career. -Very good. I stopped because of an injury. Besides, the kids like me. Great, but you're not a teacher? No. So what? I can't give you a teaching job if you're not a teacher, right? Mr. Mayor, the kids aren't learning anything. Their trainer agrees. The championships are soon. I put myself in the parents' shoes. They don't care if the kids win a match, they want them to get fresh air and keep busy. But they do want their kids to have a safe structure. Now's the time to make winners! Sorry. Let's start over, pass the ball. He won't come anymore. It's no use. It's not your fault. Yeah, right. I was too arrogant, I wanted to be an example and all I did was repel them. One after the other. You did not! They just needed a break, that's all. And so do you. Where are we at with the job ads? Can't you let go a little? Claire, you have Mrs. Gronier's perm at 11:30. We'll have to make do with that. -Hello, Micheline. -Hello, Mrs. Lacaze. -You have time for a blow-dry? -Of course. We'll squeeze you in. Ready for your hair exam? Innit funny, Claire? "Ready for your hair exam!" It's all right, I'll take care of her. Stop it! Have you gone mad? -Hi. -Hello. What are you doing here? I was feeling nostalgic. And I wanted to see how you were. Don't worry about me. All right, I'll leave you alone. -Are you still together? -Why? Wanna buy me condoms? Even if I wanted to, you're the one who decides. I'm scared stiff you'll make bad decisions... But then again, who am I to know what's good or bad? -Did you flunk because of me? -I flunked for you! You came along... VSA was hiring by the dozen. It was best to settle down. It wasn't tragic, just something I missed. But it's too late now, I don't have what it takes. I just wanted to... Give it a shot. You look very pretty like that. You put the house on the market? I don't want it auctioned off two years before it's paid for. Are you angry with me? I'm angry for thinking everything was fine. But it was fine. I stopped it all. All those sacrifices, and now you're giving up? Your dream wasn't worth much. It's out of my reach. I'd like to come home. First, you get your degree. I thought about it. This isn't a good idea. Why not? You became bilingual overnight? Please, forgive me, it's my fault. I got him involved in all this without thinking about him or his fatigue. Here, this is for you. HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE -We won! We won! -We won! We won! Bravo! Bravo for this triumph! Competence has nothing to do with degrees. If the kids win the finals, you can have the job next year. Send me a contract first. Then I'll decide whether or not I coach them. -The parents signed a petition. -Prepare a one-year contract. More importantly... A press release on town hall's efforts with the unemployed. There you have it. I'm glad you're here. It won't last, I'll knock you out! -Not sure! -Gentlemen, no comments. Ready? Go! -Mimi, it's time. Go on! -I'm not done. You need eight hours of sleep or you're good for nothing. Good night, Mimi. -Good night. -Good night. What are you doing? He's behind in Spanish. It's an American language method. -Does it work? -I have no idea. -Where is he? -I don't know. Go on, go on. And good luck! Break a leg! I don't believe it. This can't be happening. -There he is! -Where were you? You made me freak out. I almost screwed up. Dammit, did you hear me? He still won't talk? Not a word. But you should see how much he eats. All right, take care. I'm listening. I won't say anything more, because... I know nothing more. I don't speak a word of Spanish. Then tell me about your hero. It's fine. I'll pass you anyway. What? Why? At your age, this was very courageous. Of course, I do! But... not like that! You know what this was worth? Three out of twenty, max. -Reports are required for zeros. -I'll face it. Too bad. If you all do this, no wonder degrees are worth nothing. -Still no news? -Nothing. -Why won't they call? You tried? -It goes to voicemail. I'm sure they didn't get it. Créa'tifs, good day. Oh, no, it's Mrs. Lacaze. Bravo! Bravo! Dad, I did it, I can't believe I passed! to Marie Bertrand to Jacques Deray Translation: TV5 Québec Canada
