Gone where? Gone gone Well, if you lived in a place that was a little bit more upscale, you might be able to hang onto one of these girls. I love it here. - A little less love for old buildings and more for people, and you might get laid more often Pardon me, ladies. Nee-ha, Marko. - Nee-ha, ladies. Twenty! Twenty dollar! Twenty dollar! Okay! Yeah. Bye. - Bye-bye. Fleece another tourist? - Sheep are made to be sheared. Look after the place for me, will ya? Going to London again? - I'm afraid so But you've just come back. - Work. You should go to Paris. This time of year is very romantic. I'll try and keep that in mind. And besides, I can see very bad things in London for you Oh, yeah? Where do you see these things, in your crystal ball? - No. On-line. I printed it out for you They're calling him the "New Ripper." Like Jack Jack the Ripper has returned to London Nice woman - Oh, yeah Let's hit the road. The tunnel was a nightmare. I'll take the Williamsburg. They're workin' on the L-Eight What time is the flight? - We're okay Welcome to London Heathrow. Passengers arriving on Flight VS-005 from New York JFK can collect their baggage from carousel number five It's a nice hotel. You rent us a car? Right in front of ya. - What are you trying to do, Jake, bankrupt us? What the hell I thought when in Rome The Arcadia Hotel. They don't build 'era like this anymore. Is it speakin' to ya? Good I've got some ex-wives that need me to close this deal Congratulations, Mr Lewis We knew that you were the man for the job Damn right he is. He's the best goddamn architect you'll ever meet. You plan 'em, I build 'em. That really was a beautiful presentation. Well, she's a beautiful building I look forward to restoring her. To tell you the truth, it's a dream job I should be paying you. Hey, that's enough of that. - We knew that you were something special when we saw what you'd done with the old Mutual Building in Baltimore. Well, I just tried to stay true to the spirit It's spirit? - Every old building's got one I just try and stay true to it. I think it's going to be very interesting working with you, Mr Lewis I hope so. - There is just one other thing. An instruction from our employer, the owner of the Arcadia. Yeah, when do we get to meet this guy? - I'm afraid you don't. Really? - What's the request? Right this way The door at the end, and the room beyond, are to remain unopened and untouched For how long? - Forever. You are to build around it. - You're kiddin'? I'm afraid not. Our employer was quite insistent. Your company receiving the contract is dependent upon this room remaining sealed Well, I think we can agree to that. Hey! Hey, come back here! Hey! Hold on a second! Look, you shouldn't be in here. It's dangerous. Can you help me? Hey #ARCADIA HOTEL LEASE OF PROPERTY# Albert Brown Let's get better acquainted, Albert REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS 6/10/1914 Albert Brown R Brown A Kennedy That doesn't make any sense. Jake, listen, I'm working late at the Arcadia. I've been doing a little research into our mysterious employer. It turns out the Arcadia Hotel was sold to one Albert Brown ten years ago. Only problem is Albert died ninety years ago, age three months. Someone is obviously using it to hide their identity. The only question is who and why. Dammit. Hey, if there's anybody up there, I just want you know I'm gonna kick your ass. Maybe What are you doing? Who are you? - Security. You must be Mr Lewis. - Yeah This arrived for you earlier. - Thanks You take care, Sir. - You, too. Goodnight. Hang on! Hold on! Okay, it's gonna be okay. Margaret. I'm gonna get ya some help. Can you help us, please? Can you help us, please? Can you call an ambulance? Can you please call an ambulance? What is the matter with you? All right, Margaret, I'm gonna get some help I'll be right back, okay? There's been an accident I need an ambulance on the corner of Church and Old Street It's all right. They're on their way. It's gonna be okay, Margaret We're gonna get ya some help It's all right. You mustn't worry, Michael How do you know my name? I'm sorry for what I've done, Michael. I haven't got much time. They'll be here in a minute - No, you don't understand. I can't take the burden anymore. I know you can be strong. Be strong. Michael. Look, how many times do you need me to go through it? I told the sergeant at the desk, and then the guy before him. Procedure, I'm afraid I'm sorry. It's been a long night. She just stepped right in front of the car. There was nothing I could do. You have to believe that. - We do. Detective Sergeant Price. It's all right. Don't get up. The woman's name was Margaret Smith. She was a patient at St Theresa's. However, when I called them, they didn't even know she was gone. Apparently she just got up out of bed and walked out. Why was she in the hospital? Cancer Terminal The doctor said she should have been dead weeks ago She was staring straight at me Well, they had her on heavy medication, so she probably didn't even know where she was. We are gonna have to hang on to your car until the tests are complete Tests? - Don't worry. It's down in forensics. Just procedure The rental company has already sent you a replacement You're free to go, Mr. Lewis - Just like that? Great Thanks Thank you I guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time I guess. Listen. She knew my name. - Sorry? She knew my name. - It's the Ripper! They found another body! No! No! No! Price! Mills! Get in here! Move it! Take my card. - Price! - And don't blame yourself. It wasn't your fault. One thousand man hours in surveillance on a suspect that was fifty miles from this killing! There's a pattern! - No, Price, there's no pattern! The killings are random I don't buy that. - I'm not trying to sell it! I no longer care what you believe or don't believe. Your involvement in this investigation is over. What? - Orders from on high, Price. If they don't see results, they want to see change. You and Mills are off. Killer! Welcome, mailbox seven-four-five You have twenty-one new messages You've taken her away from us. You cannot walk away from this. Who is going to help us now? You'll pay for what you've done. - Killer! Ah Thanks for coming. - If I'd known you were gonna call so soon, I would never have given you my number. Did you touch anything? The phone I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. This isn't possible. Perhaps it was a different room. - What? Maybe earlier you went into somebody else's room by mistake I know what room I'm in Welcome, mailbox seven-four-five You have no messages at this time Wasting police time's a criminal offense. Look, it had something to do with that woman. Whatever your problem may be, Mr Lewis, it has nothing to do with Margaret Smith. I suggest you talk to your doctor. Or psychiatrist. Okay I've been in London two days now. Killed someone. Totaled a seventy thousand dollar car, and twenty-one people who I've never met hate me. Things are going well. Killer! You'll pay for what you' ve done Who are you? Hey! So who the hell is this guy? - I don't know. You should go to the police. - I already went to the police- They think I'm a nut. Yeah - Mr Lewis? Yeah? - My name is Charles Dodgson. I'm a lawyer, and I represent the estate of the late Margaret Smith. I have some information for you. And I wonder if you'd be so good as to call by my offices which are located at Six Little Court. #CHARLES DODGSON AND PARTNER. SOLICITORS# Someone has a sense of humor What do you think? - Gloomy, with a distinct air of menace and danger. Well, if we're gonna poke around old scary buildings let's be prepared. How come I get the basement? Please. Take a seat Quite the office you have here Yes. We, uh had a fire recently No kidding. Right. My time is rather limited, so if you don't mind, let's proceed directly to business. My client, the late Margaret Smith left instructions that you were to be given these. And when, exactly, did she leave these instructions? Two days before her death, shortly after she summoned you to London. Summoned me? - That's correct. No, that's not correct. I came to London to work. I came here to... To restore the Arcadia Hotel, which was owned by my client, Margaret Smith. It appears you are to be her successor Her heir, in a manner of speaking. Wait I-I don't even know her But she knew you Okay What do I inherit? You'll have it all explained. Now, you may open the box now, and the envelope, only once you have used the contents of the box. #CURIOUS# #CURIOUSER# Michael? - Oh, and Mr Lewis? One last thing. Only you are to use the contents therein. Are you sure you don't want me to come in with you? Yeah. Hey, I'm fine. Thanks. Okay #WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1975. POLICE FIND BODY OF CLABE IN ALLEY NO LEADS# Nineteen-seventy five? #CURIOUSER# By now you know the truth. You have The Sight, Michael, just as I did. You can see into the shadows between the darkness of this world and the light of the next. You can see that the dead do walk amongst us. I've dedicated my life to helping them But now I'm tired and weak. Too weak to continue I have to find someone to carry on my work. Someone with The Sight Someone like you. Hello, Michael Hello. - That's better. You know, these are what killed me. But that's the great thing about the after life. No repercussions. It doesn't taste quite the same, though Would you like to step outside? You look as if you need some air Look at this. For sixty years I knew the rules. What you're wearing when you die is what you come back in. And I have to die in this. Stupid Stupid I don't believe this is happening. - Me, neither. And I have to spend the after life with my ass hanging out What is going on? You have The Sight, Michael I see it clear as day. So do the dead That's why they're drawn to you They know that you can help them. You have a gift A gift that no one else possesses You should embrace it Stop it Just stop talking to me You're dead You died in the street. I saw you die I'm sitting on this bench I'm alone You're not alone, Michael I'm here Yeah, well we'll see. Hey, kid? Come here! Yeah, come here! We'll see. - I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. Think I'm strange? - Maybe. - What about her? You think she's strange? She's dressed funny. - You can see her? We can all see her, silly. She's dead. Just like us. I tried to tell you. Hey, Mister? Do you know Alice? Alice? - Over there. Alice. She says you're her friend. She says you're going to help us. Are you? That's enough You run along and play somewhere else. And take your friends with you Come on! Come on, let's go! Who are they? There's a killer hunting in this city. He hunts for children. You are looking at his victims #CHILD FOUND MURDERED# I kept photographs of the murder sights, newspaper cuttings -anything that might be of some use. Until justice is done, their ghosts are trapped in limbo Not part of this world, and unable to pass to the next. Catch the hunter, Michael Catch him before he kills again What makes you think I can do this? We didn't choose you at random. We? This world is not quite what you think it is What is that? My ride out of here What do you mean? You've agreed to help them. My work here is finished. Sorry, Michael. That's the way it works. "Rabbit in the hole " You know why Colleen left? She told me I couldn't communicate. Jake, somethin's goin' on I can't really explain what it is, but you know when you know somethin', and it's like you've always known it, but you didn't know you knew it until you know it You know what I'm talkin' about? No Listen, I'm gonna need a little time. You've gonna have to cover for me. Jake? Things might get a little weird I know what you are. I can help you. No I don't think so It's okay I understand Come on, we're late What are you doing? Oh, nothing This guy's just trying to pick me up. Rough day? Yeah You could say that. You staying in the hotel? - No Just visiting. That's right. The name's Isabel. It's best you just deal with one of us, so the others chose me Others? How-how many are there? Twenty-one in all. - Twenty-one But you already knew that Wait Where exactly are the others? Oh, they're never far away Okay. Been in London three days now. Killed someone. Watched them return from the dead. Inherited twenty-one ghosts. Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings. This is where the killer snatched Alice Alice? Alice? Michael needs your help. He needs to see the bad man. Take her hand. But be careful. Her fear will be your fear. Her pain? Your pain. I know where he took her. I don't get it. Why risk bringing her all the way up here? Why not kill her at the river? He wanted to display her body. - Okay. Well then why not up there? Why go to all this trouble and then stash her way down here? No, there's something about this place, this building, this particular spot Isabel? - What is it? Tell Michael The bad man said something else to me What? - I have to whisper it. It's a rude word. I'll see you put in the ground, you little bitch! What is it? - When was Alice killed? Seven days ago. We're going to her funeral. Alice Collins was taken away from us far too early She was plucked like a rose bud from our Lord's garden, without ever having the chance to blossom But we are not here today to judge the evil that has destroyed this family. We are here to celebrate the time that Alice spent with us, with her family, her friends, and her loved ones Don't cry I'm here. Can we go now? I don't like seeing Mommy cry We'll go soon - Look very carefully, Alice. Do you see any stranger here? - No. You're sure? - Yes. That's Mommy, Daddy, Grandpa, Uncle Paul and Mary, Auntie Joan. although she's not my real Auntie. She just lives next door. That's Toby, Tracey and Alec. They're my cousins. What about him? - Uncle David? He smells bad. I don't understand it. He said he'd see her put in the ground. He should be here. All right. Now, I have spoken to all of the children. The stories are the same. He doesn't just kill at random. He goes to a lot of trouble abducting the children, and then bringing them somewhere else to kill them. He risks detection every time he does that, which means where he kills them is important in some way. But, what is so important about these buildings, office blocks, parking garages? Just a collection of bad fifties architecture I told you. He can't do it. How can he help us? He's an amateur. Look, Michael, maybe you should get some rest. You don't look so good. Even Clabe looks better. And he is dead. Isabel, there's a pattern here. I just have to stop being so stupid and see it. Amateur You're one of them Hello? You're one of them. Yes What are you looking at? The way it used to be. Used to be? It's where I belong. Not here. Will you show me? God! Hello? Yeah. Price? Call for you. Line one London, present day. Do you know what's going on? - Don't ask me I just came here to build a hotel. The arrows point to the murder sites. The child killer? Buildings where the murders took place What do the buildings have in common? Murder. - Apart from that. Look at the buildings themselves. They were all built in the fifties And the buildings around the murder sites on the edge of the photograph? Older. A lot older. - New buildings in an old neighborhood. Why? All built in the nineteen fifties Why? The old buildings were torn down. So what? Not torn down. Blown down. Now take a look at this London fifty years ago, right after the Second World War. Notice anything? - Yeah. The murder sites are all in those shaded patches. Correct. - What are they? Bomb sites. Huge chunks of London that were leveled during the Second World War, turned into a wasteland. All the buildings the bodies were found in were constructed on derelict bomb sites. After the war, those bomb sites were crawling with kids. They used them as a playground. At night, it would have been dark and secluded. A wilderness right in the heart of the city A perfect place for a killer to hunt. The perfect place for a killer to hunt. - I said that. It can't be a coincidence. Our killer has gone to a huge amount of trouble to place the bodies on the exact location of the bomb sites. Which means... - He's a copycat. He's recreating a series of old murders. Who the hell are you? Not so bad for an amateur. You must have considered the possibility that he was a copycat Anything dating that far back would have been kept on paper files, so it would never have showed up on the computer. Sergeant Mills? Yes, ma'am? You've got the files? Yes, as you requested, ma'am Everything from nineteen-forty-five to nineteen-sixty There's a lot of it Then let's get to it, gentlemen Exactly when did we become detectives? Uh, shouldn't we get some help? I mean, don't you have a whole police force for this sort of thing? My credibility on this case isn't exactly high I don't want to go to anyone till we've got more proof Are you peeking? What? Peeking? No! What is it? What? You said something No Nothing. Peeker. Got him! I got the bugger! Eric Mace killed eight people between November, fifty-seven and January, fifty-eight Seven were children The last was an adult, stumbled across him at the site of one of the murders. Failed Priest, strict religious upbringing, thought he was on some kind of holy crusade What about the murder sites? They match exactly then and now And the dates of the murders, profiles of the children -identical You may be an American, Mr Lewis, but you're a bloody genius A bloody genius Eight killings. If our man's a copycat, there's two victims left When's the next one? In two hours I can't authorize this You're not even supposed to be on the case I know I made a mistake before A mistake? You have no idea how much heat I took for you, Price And now you want me to do it all over again Call out the men on the basis of some wild theory cooked up by a foreign tourist. He's not a tourist I don't give a damn what he is! I took a chance with you once, Price I can't afford to do that again. But what if he's right? What if in two hours the killer strikes again, and we could have been there to stop him? Okay Take Mills, stake it out But you're on your own, Price. There's just one more thing What? I need you to issue firearms, Absolutely not. You don't have a gun? This is England Police don't carry guns What happens when you want to arrest a violent criminal? I use my winning smile Five minutes to go You know what I don't get? Why copycat Eric Mace? It's not like he's particularly famous. No one remembers him I can understand Manson or Bundy, but Eric Mace? I know it's strange. He's got the letters to the press What letters? Exactly There haven't been any. Is that unusual? Ninety-nine percent of these cases, the killers write letters to the press or police or both. They want to impress us, show us how clever they are Not this one. Not one letter, not one phone call It's like he doesn't care what we think Maybe it's not us he's trying to impress Then who? Eric Mace Maybe the killer's trying to show Mace he can do a better job. No Eric Mace was hanged in nineteen-fifty-nine So much for that theory. It's cold up here, isn't it? Yeah Cigarette? No, thanks No, I mean have you got one? I quit Shame It's time He should be here Maybe the records are inaccurate. Maybe You're right We're doing something wrong No, it has to be here Forty-two years ago, the murder took place on this spot He has to bring her here He has to bring her to this spot. Then why isn't he here? What is that? I'm not sure I think Oh, my God, it's an entrance to the sewer system He's under our feet. Hey! Jake, get in there and see if you can find some Talk to me, Jake 1 Michael, you were right The main sewer runs underneath the building Mum! Wait there! Don't let anyone leave! Up ahead the tunnel's gonna split Michael, are you there? The Jake? Jake? Jake, repeat I can't hear No reception We're too deep You go that way Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Mr Lewis? Where am Where am I? You're in a hospital Now hold still Just hold still I can't move my arm Don't struggle I said don't struggle, dammit! Hold this bastard down What the hell is going on? Give him the shot Wait a minute! You've got the wrong guy here! Hey, what is that? Don't say a word. All that information he had about the killer, trying to tell us what a brilliant detective he was? Yeah, well, maybe there's another explanation A simpler explanation You think he's involved? Involved? We've got his prints on the murder weapon, the victim's blood on his clothes, not to mention the fact that neither you nor Mills saw anyone else down there in the tunnel I was with him for hours The victim was taken a day ago. Her parents reported her missing yesterday All that time he was with you, he could have had her stored down there, just waiting Why? To do it under our very noses To make fools of us God knows he's succeeded in that Yeah, Michael Lewis is suspect number one, okay? And until I know better, he remains in police custody Mr Lewis? You're my lawyer? I have many talents So tell me, what comes after "curiouser"? I'm afraid we're about to find that out Things look that good, huh? You seem to have done a remarkably good job of putting yourself in the frame Now the police have your prints on the murder weapon, they have the victim's blood on your clothes. They've also found press clippings about the murders in your office, as well as photographs of the murder sites On top of all this, you show an extraordinary insight into the actions of the killer All very-incriminating Well, only if you put it like that. Especially problematic, however, is your seemingly extensive knowledge of the victims The reason you came by this information will be a little hard to explain, don't you think? A little A good rule in life, Mr Lewis, always remember people don't like people who see dead people. You know about that? I know a good many things Visitor for ya I'm Andrew Norrington I'll be acting in your defense I thought he was He? Who? Him. I don't understand, Mr Lewis. Yeah, I'm afraid so. Yeah Shot by my partner, who then burnt the building to cover his tracks Mr Lewis. Please, Mr Lewis, we don't have much time together And to be frank, things don't look good You bet they don't I knew this kid in college. I mean, he's new great suits and everything, fools the clients, but uh underneath the Armani he's, uh. he's about as bad as they get You should be glad we don't hang people here anymore Now, the police case is very strong They already have My prints on the murder weapon, blood on the clothes, press clippings at my office, and I have an extraordinary knowledge on the actions of the murderer. You're very well informed. Bad news travels fast And to make matters worse, you attend the funeral of one of the victims That doesn't look good. Where did you get these? Standard police procedure Many killers like to attend the funeral of their victims, so there's always a surveillance team Unfortunately, for us Mr Douglas? Yes? We've got some questions. Do you have a few minutes? Well, I'm not going anywhere, am I? Do you remember somebody called Eric Mace? Young lady, I may be minus a lung and a kidney, but my memory remains intact Yeah Sick little man Spoke with a stutter. You were the arresting officer, right? Are you a policeman? This is official police business I said, are you a policeman? She's a police woman That, sir, is perfectly clear You're a very sharp man, Mr Douglas Just because you're old, you're not stupid, you know? Right What do you want to know? Anything that's not in your report Anything you might have left out In fact, anything that could be of help to us I don't think I can help you You could at least take a look at it I don't think that would do much good Oh, I I'm sorry No one told us Why should they? I recall the case well enough, but everything I had to say went in here Right. Well, we're sorry for bothering you. Wait Something wrong here What is it? There's a page missing See here, look! The last page is gone Do you remember what was on it? Well, probably details of his ninth victim Ninth? But Mace killed only eight people Yeah, that's right But he'd already kidnapped his ninth victim We found him in the basement of Mace's house He'd been there for two days, poor lad With Mace ranting and raving as he terrified him half to death What was the boy called? David David. David Connor That's right. Yeah, sad case The boy never recovered. In and out of mental hospitals for years Not surprising considering what he'd been through. And when he grew up? I have no idea You could consult his doctor, I suppose If he's still alive You think this kid had something to do with the killings? Why else would someone try and hide his existence? But I thought that David Connor was the victim? There's a well documented history of kidnap victims coming to sympathize with their captors It's called the Stockholm Syndrome And remember, David Connor was just a child, frightened, impressionable, alone Imagine the kind of effect that would" have on his mind Douglas did say the kid was in and out of mental institutions So, this boy grows up to be a man, the same age as Eric Mace, and decides to complete his holy work Copycats usually have a clear psychological reason for what they do For why they copy one murderer and not another And being closely tied to the original killer would explain a lot. So maybe Michael was right Maybe this killer is trying to impress Eric Mace The final murder was at twelve midnight Try and get a lead on David Connor Try his doctor first What are you gonna do? Take more direct action Not good enough What? Think, Michael They're relying on you What do you want me to do? You agreed to help I am in jail I can't even help myself Not good enough. You're not Michael, the Architect anymore You've accepted the burden. The burden? I don't even have shoe laces You want Alice to have another little friend? That is not fair Then help them 1111 see you put in the ground I'll see you put in the ground, you little bitch! All right, Lewis. On your feet You're being transferred Sergeant Mills! The surveillance team! Check the surveillance team! What the hell are you doing? I think you have the wrong man You could go to jail for this, Price If Michael's right, then the killer is going to strike again Tonight at midnight I'm not about to let that happen And I'm not about to let this happen, either This is madness, Price! I can't stand by and let you screw up your career Then help me This is really most unorthodox Where on earth are my glasses? This is police business Official police business David Connor Yeah, was a patient for many years Very disturbed He believed that the spirit of his captor lived on inside him The Stockholm Syndrome Yeah But in a very extreme form David Connor believed that somehow Eric Mace had taken possession of him during the two days of his imprisonment He was a young boy, you understand, a young mind So impressionable He'd even breakdown, stutter occasionally, in the manner that Mace had How long did you treat him? Ten years, till he was sixteen But in the end, you understand, he was cured Cured? Totally Oh, I know he changed his name Not uncommon with the background he'd had Do you know the name? I'm afraid not Do you know what happened to him? I 1m not sure But I do know what he would have liked to have become Not surprising, seeing that he'd saved his life. David dreamed of becoming a policeman The killer, he worked for the police He was on the surveillance team at each of the funerals So that's how he could watch Alice and the others being put in the ground Exactly The next murder's at midnight I gotta get out of here How? The trashed hotel room The acid on the car How did you do that? The others were angry They thought you weren't going to help us Which means? When we're passionate enough, angry enough, we can move things in the real world Find Alice. Find the others Bring them here. My considered legal advice on this situation would be, uh run like hell Jake? Thank you, Jake Any news? According to the records on Eric Mace, his last two murders took place on the same site The final one at twelve midnight So the police assumed that during the first murder, Mace had accidentally left something behind at the scene of the crime Something that could point to him as being the killer. So when he realized. He returned to find it, and surprised the child's mother on the bomb site She was lighting a candle for her lost daughter I read the file, The killing of the girl's mother was a departure for Mace Thirty-six years of age, medium build, blue eyes The most beautiful blue eyes Not unlike yours, Detective Price This way, I believe Michael? We're almost there You seem very sure What? Of where we're going Considering you've never been here before What are you trying to say? Don't come any closer Price! It's all I could find Thanks, Mills You made it just in time Yeah Just a couple of minutes to spare Come on, Price! Time's a wasting! Eric? Clever! But too little, too late, I'm afraid Where are we going? To finish my work, of course! You're going to set me free! Mr Lewis How resourceful of you I'm impressed Step aside Can't do that Step aside, or I'll gut here! I don't think so Same victim, same place, same time Killing her there just wouldn't work What would Eric think? You're right Of course But I c-c-can kill you anywhere Is that the best you can do? You really thought you could s-s-stop us alone? I didn't come alone DAVID CONNOR Mum! Wait there! Don't let anyone leave! I knew you could help us Not bad For an amateur For an amateur In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, we therefore commit his body to be consumed by fire Earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, and dust to dust In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen I guess that's the last we'll see of Eric Mace I hope so You gentlemen planning on staying in London long? We have a contract to complete A hotel to build. Damn Excuse me Well then Price? Thanks Michael, I've seen some pretty strange stuff this last week But whatever you've got yourself involved with, just remember you're not alone You can say that again Get 'era by Tuesday I need a working crew, and I need 'em next week We gotta get rollin' on this Yeah Okay I'll talk to you later You think he's the one? No How can you be so sure? He knows nothing of the days. He barely knows the truth about himself How could he know anything else? You have The Sight, Michael I see it clear as day We didn't choose you at random This world isn't quite what you think it is He knows nothing of the days He barely knows the truth about himself.
