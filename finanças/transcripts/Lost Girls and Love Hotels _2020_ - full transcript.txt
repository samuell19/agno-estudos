Will you take me to a love hotel? Sure. I tell myself there is no happy ending. All the pieces do not fit together perfectly. Things are ragged and messy. Good morning, Tamiko. I like your outfit. Thank you. Rockstar. Rockstar, I like that, we have to go. Margaret, we are waiting for you. Is everything okay? I'm fine, thank you. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello. Hi! God, I really love this place. You keep saying that. Come by. Cheers to that! Cheers. I wonder what it's like to be a drunk. You wonder? No, no, no, I don't mean like a drunk, like us. I mean like a real drunk. Absolutely. If you wear a helmet and B-pads to a bar because know you're going to fall over, like that kind of drunk, all in. You get it? Yeah, no fucking around. No fucking around, exactly. What did I miss? Are you guys talking about me? No, no, never. Let's go find trouble. Thank you. How come you never take me to a love hotel? You know, we could, we could go half along the bell. No pressure, like. You're like a brother to me. There you are. Where did you go? Come on, I need a drink. You know, I actually, I think I'm good. I'm going to go. Fair enough. Bye, bye! Yeah, it's nice. Get yourself. Which one do you want? This one, yeah? Okay. You like the blue? Yeah. It's good, I haven't been here. Kawaii. Cute. Here, pull. What? Pull. Okay. Pull, hard. Hard. Pull, pull. Harder, harder. Harder. I can't. I'm sorry. I want to know your mind. No, you don't. I'm sorry. Hi, sorry I think you have the flu. You should take the day off, don't you think? I'm going to speak bluntly, I'm sorry. Do you know why I hired you? Because nobody else applied. I hired you because you remind me of me. That's crazy. I mean, you're like, you're a lady. I mean that in a good way. Yes. I'm a middle-aged lady with no husband, and no children and everyone here thinks I'm kind of sad and strange. No, they don't. And if they do, then fuck them. But they still know they can learn something from me and you. But you can teach them something too. Hawkseye, do you like? Yeah, it looks like fun. No, I mean, do you like Hawkseye, the artist? Yeah, him too. What are you looking for? My bag. My bag. How do you know that I'm not a bad man? I don't. If I don't sleep in the next five minutes. What? I think I'm gonna die, don't laugh. You're gonna be fine, you're gonna be fine. Can you help me, please, Katrine. Well, hello. Hello! Hi. Let's get on me, three. I think someone's been deflowered. Compliments to the lord I don't think I was ever truly flowered. Come on, who is it? His name is Kazu and he is the most beautiful man I have ever seen. Be careful then. All these days have came and went, little did I know what it's like. What? You think it's ridiculous, I know. What? Roleplaying? I kind of like it actually, it's kind of fun to be someone other than myself, you know? I meant the whole thing. Flight attendant school. I'm in no position to be a snob, at all. Here, that's right, right? Yes. Just a bit over here, okay. Did you ever want to get married? I did. But I fell in love with the wrong man. Okay, so what will it be today? Screaming baby, terrorist? Vegan? Oh, Mr. Pervert, very good. So you need to be strong. Konnichi wa. Yeah, I could eat. Okay. Thank you. I like this car. Yeah? I'm scared to touch anything. Don't worry, we're just eating, talk, no funny business. No hanky panky? So, sushi, beer if you want? I want, yeah. What do you do up there? Basically it's a group of girls that want to be flight attendants. So I basically pronounce English to them. So you are English teacher? Not really. More like a pronunciation teacher. How's my pronunciation? It's good, it's really good. Good? Yeah, you could teach. Can I ask, hanky panky? Can we go somewhere else? Yes. You like? This is better. So, why Japan? To be alone. I came to Japan to be alone. Sometimes being alone isn't about other people. Did you try this? Is it chicken? Chicken... Elbow. Elbow Chicken elbow. Chicken elbow. Chicken elbow on a stake. It's crunchy. Cartilage. Cartilage, yes. Yes. Crunchy. Sorry, sorry. Don't worry about it. Okay. Margaret. Sometimes alone is about people. Why do you like me? You're special. How do you know? Difficult to make you happy, I think. But I like the challenge. How about you, can I make you happy? Again, I'm happy. I like a challenge too. I'm getting married. What? means happy and sad. Happy-sad. Yes, happy-sad. Wait, we still have time for sleep. I'm not a napper. Do you ever clean this place? Really? Yeah, it doesn't bother me. It's like I was born with no ability to clean, like how sociopaths are born without a conscience. I think I'm destined to go nuts. I think it's happening right now. I think it might be, you know, your gangster guy. Love is insanity by another name. He said he's getting married. Oh yeah. That sucks. It sucks? It does. That's it? Is that the best you can do? I'm sorry. Do you know why the Japanese love their fucking cherry blossom trees so much? No, it's not because they're pink and pretty, it's because they don't last. Like everything that's perfect and beautiful. It just doesn't last. It's not the point. Come on, take this. Look at you. You've bruises, that doesn't look good. Come here. Enjoy the fucking ride, okay? I'm going to find my pill guy. Okay. Your individual life vest is located in a pouch beneath your seat. Should its use become necessary, remove it from the plastic packet. Slip it over your head and pull downward on the front panel. Bring the straps around your waist and insert them into the buckle on the front hole. Pull on the loose straps until the vest fits snugly as we are now demonstrating. As you leave the aircraft, inflate the vest by pulling down firmly on the red tabs. The vest may be orally inflated by blowing into the inflation tubes at shoulder level. Thank you for your attention. We will be airborne shortly. They were so good, they were so good. They were. You were great. Thank you. I'm so proud. Me too. Do you think they're ready for mock interviews after graduation? Yeah, yeah, of course. Have you ever cut off someone's finger? Cutting fingers is for apology. Like, I'm sorry, here's my finger? Every time you look, you remember what you've done. You know, in Japanese, we say, Not saying is the flower. What does that mean? It means shut up. My brother, Frank tried to cut his finger off once when we were kids. He said he wanted a wound. You never say anything about your family. I don't have a family. Everybody has a family. How about your father? Gone. Left. Ages ago. Mother? Cancer. Last year. And your brother? He hears voices in his head, telling him to do things. Do you love her? Do you? I feel like loyalty, guilty, duty. How romantic. It's not exciting kind of love, but love. Look, you cannot be alone in this world, even if you want to be. You have to think about other people, like a family, people who become... Look, not speaking is, what is it? I don't remember what you've said. A flower. A flower. Not speaking is the flower. Shut up. Why this? It's the only thing that turns me on. And so it begins. This sore, shrieking something, is it nothing or everything? It doesn't matter. It's yours. It's you. Tell me about the word cunt. Well, in Scotland, we use it all the time. Really? Yeah. I mean, in America, it's the worst thing you can say. It's bad. Yeah, it's really bad. But over in Scotland, I could call my friends a cunt. But honestly, you could use it for anything. Welcome. Could you call your mom a cunt? Definitely not. And if I called my mom a cunt, you'd never see her again. Would you call a child a cunt? No. Oh sorry, that's ridiculous. I know, for instance, you'd call, look at the state of that cunt. Like look at the state of you, or you made a right cunt of us, so you really fucked it up. Really Shakespearian cunt. So we have Shakespeare to blame. I would. But if you ever said anything... Louise. Hi. How are you? Good, I missed you. I missed you too. This place is so cool, I love it. Louise, this is Margaret. Hi. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. Liam has told me so much about you. That's crazy because he has not even mentioned you. Liam tells me that you teach English. I pronounce English to a class. Louise is a doctor. I'm not a medical doctor, but yeah, I'm getting my PhD in linguistics. Wow. That's crazy. This is Louise. Hi, so nice to meet you. Sorry you guys, sorry I have to take this. Mom, hi, can you hold on for one second. Yeah. Liam is attempting to bring a third party into this situation. Maybe he should be convicted? Are you two jealous? No, we're really, really happy for you, and that really smart girl from high school. Marg, you're being a cunt. And you know you are. I'm not. Yes, you are. Oh my God, you guys, I'm literally freaking out, my sister is, she's pregnant! Oh, congratulations! Can you imagine having sex with Liam? He's actually kind of sweet, look at him. We could both do worse, we have done worse. That's true. Be nice. So, how did you two meet? Hi. Hey. This isn't much. Socks, thank you. That's so sweet. Today, we take a train. Where? Can I have your day? The whole day? Yes. Can we do it tomorrow? Has to be today. Okay. Look how good that looks, it looks great. Is that, that's your mother. Yeah. And that's you? And that's me and my sister. Oh my God. We celebrate our ceremony, we have this Japanese armor. Oh my God, is that your mom? She looks like a movie star. No, she's a housewife. She left? Yeah. What did your father do? Is that him? Yeah. My father is, he runs a family business. Okay. I have another gift for you. I want to show you a place, called Buddha's room. They say that here you can be reborn and let go of your past. Congratulations. Congratulations on what? Today's your birthday. No, it's not. You don't feel it? Today you're born. What are you talking about? Oh, so today's your birthday too. Yeah. I've been here now for three years. I look forward to meeting each and every one of you. What's your name? My name is Suzan. Hi, Suzan, nice to meet you. And you are? My name is Mao Hatakura. Hi, Mao, nice to meet you. My name is Saruna Takashi. Hi, Saruna, nice to meet you. This is your final pay. I'm sorry, but I didn't. There are consequences, Margaret. I let you down, I know. No, you let the girls down. I can do better. I know you can. But not here. I'm leaving. Now? What now, I mean, I'm leaving Japan. You're coming back, right? Of course you're not coming back. Everything goes away. Nothing lasts. I get it. Get enough to fucking make it. Well. That's it for me. If I have another one, they won't let me on the flight. How did you know that I was one of you? Why didn't you give me the look? The look? Yeah. Why didn't I give you the look, you know, because there's two kinds of people. There's the regular people. And there's the ones that were raised by wolves. Could you tell? Oh yeah. You came in here howling at the Moon. Kazu. Kazu. Kazu. Kazu! Kazu! Kazu. Hi. This isn't good for you. What isn't? Me! It could be your dirty little secret. Fine. I saw you with your family. Listen, I am in charge. I love you. I love you. Say that again. I love you. Say that again. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. This job isn't for everybody. Does it pay cash? Yeah. Great, when can I start? Show me your titty! I'll have one more. Hi. Is this too much for you? No. Then, please. Margaret? Hi, it's Louise. Interest in linguistics. Yes. Right. How are you? I'm good. Are you okay? I'm fine, yeah. Are you still with Liam? Liam got deported. You didn't know that? His visa ran out ages ago, but you know, Liam. But he's okay, we're actually gonna meet up in Thailand in a month. That's really good. Tell him hi from me. I will. Can I take you to breakfast? And we do this just like, okay, not the cappuccino. Oh my God, this is literally my version of heaven right now. Do you ever get homesick? I get bar sick. Like people really want to be, and all of a sudden they want to be home. But I really want to be far away from home all of a sudden and then I go. You know there's actually a word for that. Yeah? Fernweh. Fernweh is a longing for distance, just pure distance. Do you know what means? No. Means sobering up by drinking more. Hey. I like to be submissive, do you know what that means? Get undressed. Lie on the bed. Face down. Left hand. Good. It doesn't make you special or interesting that you like this. I know. I like this presence, the hotels. I do too. Nobody uses their public face in these places. We shouldn't use , the public face. The mask. When I was a kid, I used to come here. With your girlfriend? She wasn't my girlfriend, but she came here with me. So you got to see her without the mask. Sometimes the mask is prettier than the thing behind it. I could kill you now. Please do. Please do. Do it. Is this really you? Yes. You followed me. Yes. You're a coward. It's okay. It's okay. Hi. I just wanted to say that you're right about Buddha's room. My birthday. I feel it now. I'm glad. Goodbye. Welcome onboard. Your attention for the following safety instructions. Secure your seatbelts with a buckle to fasten the seatbelt. Please keep your seatbelt fastened whenever it's needed. Your individual life vest is located in a pouch under the seat. Should its use become necessary, remove it from the plastic packet and put it over your head, and pull downward on the front panel. When you leave the aircraft, inflate the vest by pulling down firmly on the red tabs. The vest may be orally inflated by blowing into the inflation tubes at shoulder level. Emergency exits on the aircraft can be found in the safety instructions. Should you have any questions, please contact the cabin attendant. Thank you for your attention, we will be airborne shortly. I tell myself there is no happy ending. All the pieces do not fit together perfectly. Things are ragged and messy. We are torn apart by events. Put back together differently by others. But somehow everything is beautiful.
