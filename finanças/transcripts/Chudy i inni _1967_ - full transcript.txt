SKINNY AND OTHERS Who are you? A man, sir. What’s your profession? What do you want from me? I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse with him that is wise and says little; But who are you? Robbers kidnapped me to the forest! Look, Nieboski! The storm is coming! Grab a hold of it. Eh, it seems to me that... The things I suffer because of you! The entire Golgotha and some more! - Who are you? - A man, sir. What’s your profession? What do you want from me? I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse with him that is wise and says little; So, who are you? An honest guy, who’s as poor - as the king. - Good, it’s all right. Now, we will do "Jester's Prophecy." Everyone take their places! Spit, fire! Spout, rain! Pawel, get ready. Wait! I’ll hold you and you’ll walk like a human! And not like someone completely drunk. Whoa! Why are you running in this rain, like people with mental problems? Because we like it! We are looking for work. I know about good work. What is that work? It’s all the same shit. You’ll remember my words. We'll go, you'll see... You can stay if you want. What are we going to do now? You, without work in this wilderness. Me without God in my heart. - Especially in this rain! - It’s all because of your talking. Because of your greed for money! Greed, my foot! Eh! We’ll go when it clears up. Yeah? But where? From this rain to another rain. This is immeasurable. What “immeasurable”? There are people here who do nothing all day, but measure. No, I don’t mean that. Only, what will I do here? You? Whatever. Anyhow, what do you care? You can say that this is a great building site. And a thousand of squirts like you work there. - Or three thousand. - It can’t be. Maybe even four. And here? What are they going to build here? It will all be flooded. With water. It can’t be. There is a house there. And another two over there. - They won’t flood it. - They will. - They won’t. - They will! The house and the entire village. Or three villages, if they want to. Gosh! What’s that? What? Go to work on the road! It’s done. They said we can start. Not here. - So, you’re here all alone? - Alone! - What are you waiting for? - I’m waiting. - Did they give you compensation? - They did. You’ll be leaving soon, to a new place. I won’t. We’ll see. Where is the foreman? There. Foreman! New ones? - Straight from the tailor! - Quite! You will strew stones on the embankment. And then you'll tamp them down. Just do it right! And you, what can you do? What? I can reap the harvest! That’s very good! Excellent! Here are shovels, shoes and so on. Take them, watch, and do the same. It’s piecework. If someone needs money, be quick. And you, Skinny, you’ll supervise them. Get to work! Do you like it here, mate? What? It’s all right, let's give it some time. And what do you think about it? Don't worry about my thinking and I won't worry about your money. That’s right! You won't get fat here, mate! Maybe you give me some of your fat, huh? What do they call you, brother farmer? Me? Well... Tomasz. From now on I baptize you along and across. And your name shall be: Scythe! - Anything against it? - Eh, Spotty! He doesn’t dare! I don't care. It’s ok. You don’t care? Looks like life didn’t teach you a lesson yet. You work here with us and you’ll see... Come on, leave him alone! What a yokel! Gosh... Our Father in heaven... You working people are sleeping like hogs, and you don't know - ...what happened. - Why are you yelling, you rude rook? What happened? - From tomorrow we’ll have a party man here. – What party man? Big news! They are everywhere. But this one will be with us, do you understand? In our team. Your kingdom come... Who is that party member? I don’t know who... I know he’s a party member! He walked into the office like an apostle, and the first thing he said was, “I’m a party member”! A full sack of laughter! Have you seen him? What does he look like? Sure, I have. He looks normal. Did he say why he came here? He said he wants to work. He insisted. Everyone is getting out of here, and this one insists! He’ll be motivating us. That’s a point. Who’d voluntarily come to such a shithole? That’s him! They say you’re a party boy. I am. - You don’t look it. - He looks like a wimp. Prove your mettle. - I have a party membership card. - What do I care about your card? But, come on, show me that card of yours. If I tear it up, you won't be a party member anymore, will you? I will. So what? We’ll see. Who among you, dear citizens, has not seen a party membership card in his life, have a look at it. Why did you come here? To work, and you? Everyone is here to work. Me too. Apparently. Bull, give the party member back what is property of the party. We’ll square up later on. That will be your bed. Red, red redness, grazing geese... - Which one of you has built a bridge? - I did, but a footbridge. I haven’t got people to work, so you'll start building as of today. And if anyone of you tries to do something different, I’ll show you what discipline means. Over there are specialist fitters. You listen to them! Go on, a bit further! A bit more! Move, move forward! Come here! You three, come here! You, you and you - move! You go here, and you, here. Move! - He must be a bloody Silesian. - Quite possible. Working folks, we’re done for the day! You know, I think it’s good money here, but if you wanted, you could earn twice as much. - How? - Easy. Instead of lying on the bed all afternoon... two of us could stay on the bridge and work another three hours or so. Until it gets dark. All right, guys! If we keep this pace, we’ll be able to drive across this bridge, there and back, in two months. End of work for today! Finally! Eh, Skinny! - Let’s go, come on! - What shall we do later on? Let’s have some beer! - Lift me up, guys! - What, lift the old boy up? Let’s go. Come on, guys. - Start the engine. - Go on! What’s with them? Extra work? What extra work? Strike workers! Eh, you shitheads! Bleeding farmers! We’ll be back, you’ll see! What, no sleeping today? You can stand there, I got used to it already. - Why are you talking to this vermin? - To whom? To those oxen that are gaping at us. Did I hear some noise or did anyone say something here? You didn’t hear any noise. Didn’t they teach you to respect... the working class? - Bullying the Bull? You! - Leave it! It’s up to them. Had enough? Take this! And this! - Take him! - To a slaughterhouse? He won't come here anymore. Unless it is to work. Red, red redness, grazing geese! And you, mate, you don’t even come to look at the bridge. - Everyone is working like mad. - I’m mad as well. You don't even know what you live for, mate. - I don’t? - You don’t. You just want to fill your belly and sleep, deaf to everything. When you’re asleep, you’re deaf as well! Have you ever thought what you’re doing all this for? In the name of what? In the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Get off my back, you philosopher. The entire cycle is delayed because of the likes of you! I’m not delaying anything. I do, what I have to do. Hey, Party Boy! Look what’s there. - Where? - There. - Well, it’s a barrage. - Not a barrage, but a water dam. That’s something for people like me. And not this mucking about in clay like a worm. To each his own. Hey! Pour some water! After lunch we’re going to the bridge, and let there be no one missing! Where? Where to? Stop working! People, a reporter came to see us! - What? - A reporter! He wants to see what we do here, how we live here. Show him everything. Let’s go. Don't leave tools everywhere! - The reporter wants to talk to you. - What about? About everything. About life. Who is he that he’s so interested in it? I’m a reporter, my good man. I’m not a good man. - I’m an old man. - All right, Old Boy. We can talk to him, but not now. Later. Man, come to the barrack in the evening. - Today’s Saturday, we can talk. - All right. And this is Miss Ewa, the nurse. Since I’m here... Who is a party member here? The local priest! - What, no party people? - Well, there is one. Who is that? This one! - Eh, Party Boy! - What? Step forward! - Are you a party follower? - I am. - What’s your name? - His name is Party Boy! - So, you are not a party member? - I am. So, which is it now because I don’t understand anything? I am a member, but my name is different. Your name is your name. You’re up to something. Show me your membership card. Come with me. Well? What did he want from you? He wanted to tell me that a minister is coming. - Did he tell you that? - Get lost! Hold it Old Boy! First class circus! Stop it, Old Boy. You’re always on about this circus. One could think it’s a circus not a building site, and we are monkeys and not workers. Do you care about being a worker? - I do! And you, piss off! - Look at that! Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the construction site of the water dam. I am visiting the team headed by Skinny. Outside there is a forest of masts and cranes, machines, and a buzz of work. Cloudy sky, black earth. The sun... the sun is not shining. A normal day at the dam. Another step towards tomorrow. I'm talking to Skinny’s team. Have you been building this bridge for a long time? Quite long. So long, in fact, that we will have built it in the end. - And so? - Nothing. No, I’m asking how the work is going? Not bad, as is usual in springtime. Surly, you must be happy now. - Happy? What with? - Well, generally speaking. Well, generally speaking we are. There is nothing to worry about, isn’t that right? The whole bridge is built in one fell swoop, and all that during extra hours. In harsh conditions - simultaneously battling with a landslide and battling with a dam. A bridge for future generations. We are building bridges... Why have you rotten lambs left me all alone on that bridge? Maybe I better leave. - Goodbye. - We’re going. And if anything, we’ll call you. Well? What kind of reporter is he? An artist, or what? Artist, my foot! Just a twit! You’re a twit yourself. He is what he is. Don’t you worry about me! I, for example, I know who I am. I like to have a good meal, a good drink and work now and then... And I reckon everyone should live as they want, right? And with a guy like that, nobody knows what kind of a man he is. He fiddles with his box, tells a story and who’ll do anything about it? No one! That’s for sure. Because nobody cares about what he scribbles there. You don’t know. Maybe somebody cares. Do you care? I have other things to care about. I don’t give a hoot. All this talk is just a waste of time. Let’s go for a drink. Hey, people, what about if we get... that reporter pissed? Why not! Great! Get the car! We’ll get him pissed! Eh, Mr Reporter! Would you like a drink with us? We’ll go for a pint, huh? Silesian, are you coming with us? Leave him. Come on, guys, put your Sunday best on. Why are you moving it? Leave it! Go away! I’ve put it there and it should stay there! Give over! - Stop! - You fool! What happened? You should get struck by lightning, you idiotic beast! Rather a devil than a beast! Your own mother should have gotten rid of you! What was it? A big dog or a cat? A beast, as big as a barn! Don’t talk! It was a goat! A small goat! He’s gone mad... - To hell with it! - Let’s catch it and see what it was! Don’t catch it, let it live, whatever it is! Here it is! I’ll get it! To everyone his own and we have a goat! Play the giddy goat! A goat! A little goat! Hit it over the head and that’s it. It shouldn’t be running around. Today, it ended up all right, but tomorrow somebody may get killed because of that beast. Scythe, you have a knife. Stab it and be done with it. We’ll have a roast. No, we can think of something else. You can think when you eat the roast. I propose to hang it on the first tree, kind of as a traffic offender. You know what? I have an idea, a new idea. - Well? - Let’s tie it to the car. Dead, it will know, that it's forbidden to run around on state roads. - It’s non-human. - And non-goat. Stop talking! If Scythe doesn’t want to, I’ll do it. With a rock. Don’t touch it, or you can finish me off as well! Come on, Old Boy! Are you sick or what? It cannot run around unpunished. I’ll take it. Alack, bare headed? My lord, hard by here is a hovel. Let’s find a shelter against the tempest. Repose you there while I to this hard house more harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised, which even but now, demanding after you denied me to come in, return and force their scanted courtesy. My wits begin to turn. Come on my boy. Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart that's sorry yet for thee. He that has and a little tiny wit, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain! Must make content with his fortunes fit, Though the rain it rained every day. The rain it rained every day... True, boy. Come bring us to this hovel. Hold on, stop! “The rain it raineth every day” That’s what I’m saying, “The rain it raineth every day” It’s all right now. And now, Miss Regana and Goneryla. We’ll do scene seven. What happened? Give it to me, Comrade. - We’ll fix it for the artists. - Thank you. We start with the line: “Hang him immediately.” Come on, sir, here's the place: stand still… How fearful and dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low! What are you staring at? I was assigned to the artists. - What are you... - What, aren’t you there? - Where? - Well, there. In the town, with everybody. I’m not there, I’m here. King Lear Travelling theatre I like watching it. Good job, huh? I've been here for four months already. I've been here for four months. I like it here. - Did you want to come here? - "Did you want to come here?" You may like it here, but no one will come to you to get cured. We’ll see. Why? When people are lonely, they either work all day, - or sleep not to think about it. - About what? - And you? - What about me? Before, I worked in a city. It’s a different life. Here, it’s a paradise for savages and hermits, isn’t it? You’re missing it. Yeah. What are you thinking about? What are you thinking about? I’m looking at you and I don't know how it happened that you are here. How? I normally travel around the country. My father is a big boss, he wanted me to be like him. But I said, “Good bye, old man!” and went my own way. That was seven years ago. I’ve been to several cities… The engineer said about you that you are hard, tough people, almost like heroes. Heroes are also people. One is hard, another one soft. And I want to... I want to laugh! What makes you laugh? You know... Damn it... I would buy you a little house. It would have a door and two windows. In one window you... Can you hear it? My gang is coming. What a nice box. You don’t understand me and you don’t understand me...! Why shouldn’t I understand you? You don’t understand me because you are all together! We are... Wait, wait. Come on, come on... What are you talking...! Let’s go down! We go down and take a shortcut! - Did you see him? - Who? You’re never alone and I’m alone, and this is the most boring thing in the world! I have my nothing. You have a scythe and what? That’s my nothing. But you are alone with yourself, and I am with a scythe. You are one of them. They are them. They are workers and I'm Scythe! Eh, philosophers! We have to show the bridge to this reporter. Let him see it with his own eyes! Let them know what the working class is doing, while others stuff themselves with dumplings and bacon! We will show him what human hands can do. Show that bloody sissy! Let him know! To the bridge with him! - Okay, let’s go to the bridge! - Wait, wait! Like that! To the bridge! It’s slippery here, I have to watch myself. Three-four! We are building bridges, We let thousand horses through... Look, man! This is a good job, this bridge! You’ll remember it all your life. For example, a tank could cross this bridge, and, d’you know, it wouldn’t move! It wouldn’t move! And you would move! - Who, I? - Yes. - Well, I would! - ‘Cos you’re made of different clay. Who said that the bridge is made of clay? It’s made of steel! And whoever disagrees with it, I’ll... All right, all right, Old Boy! The bridge is made of steel, but the reporter is made of clay. - A different clay! - Yes, a different one! What’s...? - And the bridge is a good job. - Excellent job, a jump into tomorrow! Give it to me! Hit it over the head and that’s it. It shouldn’t be running around. Today, it ended up all right, but tomorrow somebody may get killed because of that beast. Scythe, you have a knife. Stab it and be done with it. We’ll have a roast. No, we can think of something else. - He’s a loafer! - That’s what I wanted to say. A loafer! I have an idea. We have to get rid of him. - Of whom? - Of this one! We could cleanse him of everything bad. Let's go to the banks, we'll bathe him! Why to the banks? It’s better from up here! Mister reporter… all the best, fly! Good bye! What have you done? Oh, my God! Jesus! Look there under the pillar, let’s go to the middle. - It must’ve been somewhere here. - Where? Here! Did you look under the formwork? No! - Well, and what? - Nothing! - Let’s go more to the left! - No... No, it’s somewhere here... Wait! But... no, no! It’s worse here. To the left, to the left! He must have swum downstream. He’s not... No point in searching. He’s not here. Well, what a mess, huh? Quite! To hell with that reporter! - Devils brought him here. - I’m cold. Couldn’t he have stayed at home? There was a man and the man is gone. Who threw him in? Nobody. - Everybody. - He jumped himself! See? - No. It was Spotty. - Oh, you...! Spotty. Well, that’s me. Well, mate, pack your things. This is not a place for you. - Nobody will know... - That's not the point. - So what? - I can’t stand you being here. I’ll punch you in the face, you are a beast! That’s right! Kisses. Oh! You bastard! Goodbye! Goodbye, working class! You can go to hell! Or even further! You know who you are? A looser! And you too, you bloody bandits! All of you together! Stop it. Shut up! Move someone! You are still a child. What’s your name? Eva. Eva. That was my mother’s name. I am... Attend the lords of France and Burgundy. I shall, my lord.. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know that we have divided in three our kingdom, and 'tis our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age conferring them on younger strengths, while we unburdened, crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, and you, our no less loving son of Albany, we have this hour a constant will to publish... Where are they? They all pissed off. Like rats. Is it guilty conscience? Or maybe it’s a fear that makes you run, huh? Move. You are in my way. Let the great gods, that keep this dreadful storm o'er our heads find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch! You, who has committed secret crimes and escaped justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand, thou perjured, you incest-practicing people who pretend to be virtuous. Tremble and shake, villain, for secretly plotting against human lives... - Did you see my people? - No, I didn’t. I am a man more sinned against than sinning. Alack, bare-headed? My lord, hard by here is a hovel. Let’s find a shelter against the tempest. Repose you there, while I to this hard house more harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised, return again and force their scanted courtesy. My wits begin to turn. Come on my boy. How are you? Are you cold?? Silesian? What? Where are the guys? They went somewhere. They took that redactor with them... - When? - When we went to the town. - Where are they? - They all run away. We must do something! Inform somebody! Then go and report to the police! Go, tell them everything! Well, are you coming with us? No, I just want to see someone. Why are you running away? Is it guilty conscience? Guilty, my foot! Everybody is running. Pawel, come back to work. Are we to go back empty-handed or what? For Heaven's sake, man, we will lose so much money! - For Heaven's sake! - Piss off! I’ll turn you back, even if I have to drag you through this mud. You looser! - What, are you hitting Squirt? - Piss off, it's not your business! Maybe... Maybe it is mine! Let it be respect and peace! And now, come! What are you standing like ninnies? Just look at yourself! Actually, everyone knows that I did not push this redactor. I think, that I can go back too. Besides, to be honest, I have nowhere to go. All right, Old Boy. - And you, Scythe? Are you going back? - Sure! I’ve signed the contract. And is boring without work. Come on, Pawel. Let’s go. Wait here. Why are you standing? Get a move on! Bloody schmucks! And what about you? Am I to work for you? Look, Silesian is such a madcap, but he got really hooked! He needs a woman. And this one must’ve had a good brainwash. We must let people through. But at least they’ve made a man of him, and not a sissy. Go ahead. - Come here. - Who I? You. - Where is the redactor? - Who? - Do you know what happened to him? - How should I know? And you? I was with Bull. - You don’t know either? - I never left Skinny’s side. - Nobody knows? - Nobody. Did he go to the town with you? He did, he wanted it. I mean, he drove there. And then? - Then? - Yeah. As usual. - Ah! We caught a goat. - How? By its tail. After dinner you’ll gather in front of the office. You will testify in the reporter’s case. They can... Bloody pen pushers! Next. Can we do it now, officer? Take it. - Was the reporter with you in the town? - He was, why shouldn’t he have been? What happened there? What state was he in? Him? Well, he was in a state. He was drunk like a skunk. He was spewing, philosophising... - And what happened after? - After? He was still drunk. And after that? The same. If a man guzzles down a meter of vodka, it take him long to recover. And what were you doing? The same as the redactor, but I didn’t philosophise. Did the redactor come back with you? He did. And what happened after? What could have happened? To my mind, the guy was drunk. He fell into the water and swam away! To Gdansk... How do you know he fell into the water? Where else would he fall? He couldn’t fly up! - He’s right! - What are you doing here? All right, go. Next! No, nothing will come of it. They will all say the same thing. Maybe he really left? Without telling anybody? Right. He left all his stuff. What’s that with the police? Why are they here? - See, they came for Silesian. - How comes? He stole the manager’s cow and... Talk, talk and the sun is still high. - Be quiet, you money grabber! - And whose fault is that? Maybe mine? - Then go and tell them! - Shush... Did the cat get your tongue? Next! You belong to the party, right? Yes, I do. So tell us. What happened to the redactor? Write it down. I don’t know exactly. They were in the town, and then went onto the bridge... And there, the reporter... into the water… How do you know that the reporter fell into the water? - I don’t know. - So, why did you say that he fell? ‘Cos they’re saying that he fell. Who did it? - Someone. - Which one? I don’t know. You don’t want to say. No. Nobody knows that. All right, all right. We’ll check it. I know, what it means! But it’s not like that! Do you hear me? Bull? Do you hear what I’m saying? Old Boy! Skinny! Listen to me! As I stand here, I’m telling you I’ll find this reporter. I’ll dig him up from the ground! And if I don’t, you can spit in my face! Useless shithead. Maybe he is not as useless as you think? One, two, three... One, two, three... There. - All right! - What do we have here... - Go on, play! - Wait... My game. - What are you waiting for? - That’s my trick. - Here. - Come on. Wait, wait... And I get you with this! - I like cutting grass. - Eh... What “eh”? One could earn more there. Do you care? Care or not, but there I would get what I need sooner. What? Come, man, and you’ll see something you’ve never seen before! I’ll get the guys! He fell on his head and is writing an application to a madhouse! He is excusing himself for being such a madcap! It’s a pure circus! He got drunk! Or he’s got corns. Come, come guys! “My darling...” Wait! “My darling, I don't have the courage to ask you for forgiveness. I understood my mistake when I lost you. However...” Let go! Let go! Can’t you take a joke or what? Let go! Look, how nice it is. Maybe you’d rather have some milk? I’m going to the town. - You’d better not go there. - I’m going. - You could do with a little sleep. - I’m going. I’m going ‘cos I’ll go bonkers here! Who’s there? I know it’s you. You came to keep on telling me your biography. Or maybe the hero is ashamed? Don’t touch me! Don’t! Eva, I wanted to say...… Watch out, diggings! Eva, Eva! No... I would buy you a small house. Would you want it? You’ll go to another construction. You’ll forget about the house, about me. That’s not me, I’m not like that. I'm tired of travelling. So you’ll chuck it all in and you won't go to any construction site? No, I will. - But you’ll come with me. - How do you know? I know. We will go to Cracow. I’ve never been there. I won't do anything for three days. - And me? What about me? - You too. - You won't do anything either. - Why don't you want to go today? And the work? It has to be finished first. Then we can go out into the world. Red, red, redness, grazing gees... Listen, guys. A minister is coming for the opening, we’ll have to make a banner. Minister, my foot! The minister definitely won’t come. What’s all that about the banner? There must be a banner. You could make a bridge, you can do this as well. - Which one of you painted... - Easter eggs? Which one of you painted Easter eggs? Scythe, step forward! Easter eggs? I didn’t. It doesn’t matter. That’s an order. Hey, Silesian, have you booked a church yet? Get to work, man! Go back, go! - They don’t have a heart! - Have God in your hearts! Don’t let them onto the bridge! Let them drawn! Bloody she-devils! Let them get wet! - See, what happened to you? - It’s nothing! It’s a pity that Party Boy is not here, he would explain it all to us. Comrades and citizens, at the beginning of our ceremony Comrade Minister will award the leading team of Jozef Kawulok. A silver Cross of Merits is awarded to: Kawulok Jozef, Waliczek Tomasz, Rusin Edward, Muskala Mieczyslaw, Podkalicki Marian and Smuga Pawel. The next to take the floor is Comrade... Comrades and citizens, I won't expatiate, comrades. I will say it briefly: our whole country is one great construction site, the length and breadth. And although it is still difficult for us, we are building a future for new generations. And your slogan “We are the future” is correct. Comrades and citizens, this bridge here which we have before us ... Scythe, so your name is Tomasz Waliczek. Well, I’ll be damned. And you, Old Boy, your name is Rusin. And you, Skinny? His name is Kawulok. I wonder what the name of Party Boy is? It must be something more posh. ...people who ignored initial difficulties, - without looking back... … - Well, I always look back. ...without wringing their hands, strived for success. We built the dam one week ahead of schedule. Look at him, he built it. We built a bridge and a section of road. We will build even more new roads and new bridges. Long live the builders, pioneers of progress! Long live the leading team of Jozef Kawulok! Long live the creative effort of the working masses! Hello. - Hi, man. Where are they? - Who? Who are “they”? Skinny and the others. I don't know, on the bridge or somewhere. Go, go. Well, what? The bridge is for the minister not for the prefect. You have only this minister on your mind. Go on! Move! Look! Party Boy with the police! So, my working class, what could this mean? I can smell prison in the air. We’ll have to pay for this reporter. What a circus! You won't get this circus out of your head even in purgatory. I’ve been to a circus once, but I’ve never been in jail. Well, you will now. They want jail a man with a medal. - Why not? - It’s a shame. One could go bonkers. They’ll be here in a minute. What are they up to? I wish they wouldn’t wait. Well, man, we’ll have to face it. Tough luck. - Here is your lost treasure. - Gosh! Party Boy, what are you talking about? How come you are here? I came to the celebration, brothers. A celebration like this without me? So you didn’t swim? I mean, you didn’t go to Gdansk? No, to Warsaw. - That’s far away. - Far, but nice. I was there, I know. Me too, but that was before the war... Where did you find him? And where did you lose him? I told you, I’d find him. Here he is. Well? - Here is the medal. - For me? What for? Take it. The whole team got one. Damn it! Old Boy! You have a new goat! See him? He changed his partner! That’s my old goat! To hell with them! Rotten devils! Wait till I get them! - That’s a dog! - What happened Old Boy? Those rascal painted my goat white! Groomed it! White colour is more fitting for today’s celebration! Trousers off? What a mess! One mustn’t... One mustn’t do such things to an animal. It the poor thing were to look at itself and see that it is white, and not black, as God commanded, it would die of fear. No one should be told or shown that he is different than he is. Neither man nor animal. You shouldn’t try to force them to be happy. If, for example, it wants to be black, let it stay that way. Don’t pull its tail! Now you are black and not white, as you were before! And now let's go see water flowing into the dam. So, what have you been doing since then? We’ve cursed you enough for a lifetime! It’s all because of your swimming. We couldn’t work in peace. Do you remember that? A normal day at the dam. Another step towards tomorrow. I'm talking to Skinny’s team. Have you been building this bridge for a long time? Quite long. So long, in fact, that we will have built it in the end. - And so? - Nothing. No, I’m asking how the work is going? Not bad, as is usual in springtime. Surly, you must be happy now. - Happy? What with? - Well, generally speaking. Well, generally speaking we are. Why weren’t you watching your goat!? Don’t say anything! Not a word! What do you mean “not a word”? Couldn't you take care of this animal of yours? - Don’t say a word. - It’s only a goat! It’s only a goat... Such a small creature... even smaller now, that it doesn’t know anything. - Well, good bye then. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Good bye. - Good bye. Bye. - Good bye! - Good bye. He’s got it made. Godspeed to him. Come, Old Boy. Good bye, guys! - Well, that’s the end. - Yeah, the end. Every beginning has its end, and what would you want? - Nothing, I’m just saying. - Right. Something that starts must always end, right? It doesn’t have to be so. It doesn’t have to, but it’s always like that, right? - I haven't heard of another case. - You haven't. But maybe somebody else had. What do you know? We did it, we can go. And what about your three pear trees and your land? What about it? They’re all right. So, what? Do you want to stay here for the winter? We can go. Where to? We have to wait till Scythe counts his money. Look, he keeps his money in a sock! It’s not a sock, it’s a stocking! A women's stocking. A women’s and men’s. Stop talking rubbish. Let’s leave here. Hairdressing for men and women. That’s a business! Watch it, or it’ll collapse! It’s good. Mice won’t eat it. Of course, you dafty! You only think of this men’s and women’s hairdresser, of this stocking stuffed with money! It doesn’t occur to you, that this is our work. It’s the creation of our hands. Our everything. How do you know that I don't think so? The stocking... and the three pear trees. I can buy something else. It’s the same. I don't care about money, but when I work, why should I do it for free? Would you work for nothing? I would. So would I. I don’t give a damn about money. I can, for example, throw it all in the river. All right! If you’re so clever, let’s throw it in, all of us. Fine. All right. - A deal? - A deal. Well, then line up. Pawel? When I say one, two, three, everybody throws their money in. No cheating! Count, don’t talk! Ok, watch out... One... two... two and a half... - two and three quarters... - Shit! Three! Gosh! Who threw it? I did. Why did you do it? Why, why! I don’t know. I’ve never seen such an idiot! A philosopher idiot. A prehistoric specimen, trusts people when it comes to money. You should put a guy like that in a cage and show him at fairs! You would quickly earn more, than what he threw in there. Go away. Go away or I'll hit you! I can't look at you, you looser! Leave him! That was his money. - He’s not stupid. - So, maybe I’m stupid, huh?! No, nobody is stupid. I don't hold it against you. It was a joke. I threw it in and that’s all right. Maybe it could be fished out somehow? How? With a bait or lure? What, is it a fish to catch it? I'll lend him some or give it to him. - So will I. - Wait, me too! We have to, he’s a good guy. Party Boy! Party Boy! Party Boy! Take it, Party Boy. Well, take it, man! Well. And what? Sometimes you can trust people. Even when it comes to money. You are a nice guy, just a little crazy. Are you coming with us? Sure! I buy everyone a pint! All right! But that’s at a new job. THE END
