[theme music] [Newsey] Children often ask how Santa is able to travel the whole world in one night. Santa does have a bit of Christmas Magic, but he can't do all of this by himself. Santa's success, and ours, too, requires the help of the human spirit. Every year, just like clockwork, an old and special friend of Santa's awakens from her sleep at his call. She races across the Arctic mountaintops and sparks the great glow of the Northern Lights. The lights shield Santa from sight and even pause time. But they can't stay aglow for long by themselves. As children wake to find gifts left for them by Santa, their laughter fills the air, and it forms a sacred song. Though it's silent to human ears, it powers the Northern Lights and keeps them from dying out. As long as children are filled with Christmas Spirit on Christmas morning and carry the hope of Christmas in their hearts all year long, the song will ring out for the whole North Pole to hear and keep Santa on schedule delivering presents in one magical night. Welcome to the moment I learned all of this firsthand. Has the Christmas Spirit been measured again? We've checked it twice, sir. General, what about the puppies' barrels? Kids are helping to fill the barrels with lots of Christmas Cheer. And the reindeer? More have been adopted and loved than ever before! Well, that's good news! Mister Maestro, what about the "Song of Christmas?" We've been rehearsing all year! Santa, any chance we will have a problem with the "Song of Christmas" this year? Ho! Ho! Ho! Why would you think that? I've heard a lot of reports about sadness and anger in the world. Ah. You'll see for yourself. There is always so much good. You just have to look for it. Ho! Ho! Ho! Why, hello, Captain. It's nice to see you back. Hi, Santa. Sorry to interrupt. [chuckles nervously] Uh, I was just on my way to congratulate the North Pole's newest journalist over there. Well, that is a fine gesture. We are all very proud. [elves cheer and applaud] Thank you. [clears throat] But you were saying, Santa? Oh! [chuckles] Yes. No matter how bad things get, hope and faith always win, and never is that belief greater than on Christmas morning once we've made the rounds. Yeah! Especially at my house. Michael loves Christmas! -He really does! -Yes, that's very good news. -Well, that is exciting! -Yeah! Let's focus on doing our part. That's all we can do to be sure the "Song of Christmas" lives on. [all] To the "Song of Christmas!" [cuckoo clock chimes] Santa. Santa! It's nearing Christmastime! You must be getting ready! Off you go! Be on your way! Oh! Go now! Go! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! All right, Elf Joe. Well, then, it looks like the fun is about to begin! [elf over loudspeaker] Paging Scout Elves Fluffy Puff, Joy Sugar Cookie, and Captain. It's time to report back to your families. Oh, that's me! I better get back home! -I'll see you soon! -Good luck! Come on. Come on!

I'm so glad you did. And, of course, you're home just in time. The cookies are almost ready. Mm-mm! Maybe I should try one... to make sure they're good. [laughs] Oh, okay. Wow! Thanks! Mmm. You have just a few minutes before I need to run to the store. They close early on Christmas Eve. Would you turn on all the Christmas lights? [Michael] Sure, Grammy. [Grammy] I can't figure out what you did in there. [train whistle blows] Hey, Captain, what do you think? Looks pretty good, huh? Did you watch over Mom today? You know she's coming home tomorrow, and I've pretty much waited forever for this! It's going to be the single greatest day of my life! I also see that you're watching over our snow globe collection. This one from Mom is my favorite. Do you think I could get a new one from Santa this Christmas? A new snow globe would be really cool! [Grammy] Michael, we need to go! I need some extra sprinkles. [Michael] Coming! Just a minute! [cheerful music] It's Christmastime. Call out to Nora. [owl hoots] [owl hoots] [owl hoots] [owl hoots] [lively music] [howls] Ho! Ho! Ho! Nora! Merry Christmas! It's time. Is the clock synching properly? Yes. The time is exact. She will begin any moment. Let the countdown begin! [all] Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six!

I think you might need a few more Christmas lights, though. You missed a tiny little spot right over there! Ha-ha. [chuckles] Just you wait. She's going to love it! Of that, my dear, I have no doubt. [vehicle horn beeps] Hi, Trish. Hi, Michael. [Grammy] Hi, Eleanor! I've got something for you. Looks like it might be from Barb. Oh-oh, can I see it? You know, she's supposed to be back home tomorrow. I'm sure it would mean a whole lot to have her home for Christmas since his dad passed away last year. Yes, Christmas is hard. [Barb] "Hey, Michael! Hey, Mom! I can't wait to be with you again. I miss you all so much. They're saying I'm coming home, but don't count on me being with you for Christmas. There's been a delay with my paperwork. I'll get word out as soon as I'm able. I love you both. -Your Mom and your Barb." -[cries] -What's wrong with Michael? -What is it, Michael? Mom doesn't think she's gonna make it home for Christmas! Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry! She's still going to come home, it just might not be tomorrow. [General] By all indications, Santa's flight is on course and making good time. However, it looks like the Northern Lights are dimming! Has anyone heard it yet? Has the "Song of Christmas" begun? No, not a peep. But we are going to need it. Or those lights aren't going to last through the final deliveries. The "Song of Christmas" is the most powerful ballad that has ever been! The most important song at the North Pole! It powers the Northern Lights and keeps them glowing through Santa's flight. There is no Christmas Magic without that! Now, now. It will come. Santa's only halfway around the world. Kids have not begun to wake up yet. But they will, and soon. When will they wake up? The anticipation is more than I can bear! Maybe the song is not coming. Mister Maestro, why are you being so overly dramatic? -That's my job! -[giggles] Wait a minute. What if the song is not coming? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don't get your onesies in a bunch. I don't even think that can happen. I know it's hard for elves to understand, but sometimes humans lose hope and forget the joy that is Christmas. But that wouldn't be enough to stop the "Song of Christmas," would it? It's possible, if they're not just sad but are truly in despair. Oh, heavens, not despair! The emptiness! The longing! The giving up! That's just the worst! The complete opposite of hope! [children giggling and laughing] I think... I think I hear it! -Yes! Yes! I hear it, too! -That's it! I'd know that little girl's laughter anywhere! That's the song that I've been waiting for! It's a sign to the heavens! Christmas Spirit's all right! Hurry, hurry, hurry! One, two, three, oh... ♪ Sounds of children's voices ♪ ♪ Ringing in the air ♪ You! You stand up straight! Sing, my elves of music! Sing! ♪ Christmas Hallelu ♪ This is so much better than flying by myself! Woo-hoo! [laughs] -Faster! Faster! -Ho! Ho! Ho! We have a long night ahead of us, Newsey. Is that the "Song of Christmas" I hear? It's beautiful! Ho! Ho! Ho! Yes, I believe it is. What exactly causes it? The sound of children laughing and playing on Christmas morning, of course. So it's really from the joy that comes from receiving a gift of selfless generosity. That's right, Newsey. It's up to us to spread the Spirit of Christmas. How are you going to land the sleigh? There is no snow here. Ho! Ho! We've got that covered. [Newsey] And what if Michael isn't asleep yet? [Santa] Our friend Nora can take care of that, too. Come on, Newsey Noel. What are you waiting for? [Newsey] Coming, Santa! [gasps] Santa! Well, hello, there, Captain. How's our boy? I've never seen him like this, Santa. He cried all night. And he said he doesn't even care if Christmas comes at all. Michael's never said anything like that before. He just wants his mom to come home. Can we do that? You must understand that while we do our best, there are times when we simply can't grant a request. Not every wish for Christmas Day joy involves wrapping, or presents, or even a toy. Sometimes kids hope for so much more, like miracles, or friendship, or peace and not war. Those are not items that I can hand out. Those are gifts from the heart which humans give out. Santa, I think all of his hopes for a happy Christmas were dashed when he got that note from his mom. We need Michael to find hope, some joy, some belief, and understand he's not alone. I wish there was more we could do. Well, with Nora's help, there might be. [children vocalizing] [glass shatters] [Newsey] What's happening outside? The Northern Lights are barely visible. Look! -Quickly! We must go! -Bye, Michael. Hurry, Santa! We're running out of time! We are in big trouble here. Nora, you know what to do. [elves talking indistinctly] Good luck. I can barely see them. On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On, Prancer and Vixen! Ride quickly, my friends! Others need my attention! [Captain] Hang in there, buddy. [children's vocalizing continues] That sounds off-key. What is that horrible sound? My precious song! What now? Whatever will become of us? It's even worse than we thought. Nora had to stay behind with Michael. What? So will Christmas not come at all the next year? What? Can Christmas come without presents being delivered? Yeah, how can we possibly hide the sleigh? The "Song of Christmas" could stop! How can we do anything on Christmas Eve without the Northern Lights at Christmastime? My friends, Christmas always comes. Whether or not it comes with the joy of children's laughter on Christmas morning is another matter entirely. You see, Nora knew that one day she may have to be the gift... [chuckles] or at least carry a gift brought by my sleigh. So will Nora's gift be enough this time? Will the lights come back on? I know Michael and other children all over the world will choose faith and keep the will to believe. And that will keep the lights glowing. And the sleigh back in the air in no time. [Nora howls] What? What? What was that? [sighs] I love you, Mom. What? "Dear Michael, I heard you wanted a new snow globe for Christmas. I think you'll really like this one. And don't ever forget: there aren't many things more powerful than hope. Not even me. Santa." What is this? No way! A new snow globe on an arctic fox? This is so cool! I love it! And here is a special wish for you, Mom. [yawns] What are you doing up already? Grammy! Look at my cool new snow globe on a real arctic fox! I named it Snowball, and it came with this neat book from Santa! "They'll remind kids that answers don't always come in the way people want them, but they mustn't become fearful or faithless, for that's the great foe of Christmas Spirit in all that we know." Oh, I love it, Michael. That is really special. You know, Mom wouldn't want me to be so heartbroken this Christmas. I'm going to try my best to keep my hopes up. We will have Christmas when she comes home, even if it's July. Well, that is certainly the right attitude. That's what Christmas is supposed to be about, choosing to be grateful for what we do have. [elves cheer] Look! The lights are getting brighter! It's a beautiful kaleidoscope of colors! I'm overwhelmed! Listen! The song! It's all better! Oh, the pretty greens! Fuchsia! Michael and the other kids in despair have pulled through. They're so tiny. Look at that tail! Look at those eyes! So precious! No, no, no! Get down, get down! Oh, my goodness! They are so cute! Totally. Well, would you look at that? I've never seen such-- Adorable, little, fluffy-- Bundles of joy! But what can they do? Yes, what could they do?

There are a lot of children like Michael who could use a little friend from the North Pole. We are all on their team! And while we can't always give them what they want for Christmas... We can send a friend to remind them that there is always hope. And that all of us are counting on it. [man] "The Hope of Christmastime" on three! What in Heaven's name is that?

Hey, Mom. I thought about you so much. It's a Christmas miracle! Now that's a miracle. I've never seen this on Christmas morning before. [uplifting music] [Newsey] So every Christmas Eve, after children have fallen asleep, their little fox cubs coat the rooftops with snow and spark the Northern Lights. The lights shield Santa from sight and even pause time. As kids wake to find gifts left by Santa, their laughter fills the air and forms a sacred song. When humans choose hope all year long, it powers the Northern Lights, and Santa is able to travel the whole world in one magical night. The sleigh is waiting. Let's hop to! Get to it! Let's move!
