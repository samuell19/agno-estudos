Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media Wait. Wait a minute. Come back here. Walk over there. Now back. Your shoes are squeaking. But I bought them special, Mr... They are squeaking! Now, away you go, and soften them up. There is nothing more intolerable at a dinner party than a footman with squeaky shoes, go on! Let's hope they don't squeak today. Welcome to Eaton Place, the stately setting for "Upstairs, Downstairs," the most famous British drama series ever made. For 5 years and 68 episodes, this was home to the Bellamy family, their servants, and all the many dramas they shared. In this special program, we'll be turning back the clock to find out what went on behind the scenes... The problems, the pressures, the good times, and the bad. I look back at those early episodes now, and I see not only the character floundering, but I see an actor playing the character floundering, so between us, there's not a huge impression, I don't think, being made. "Upstairs, Downstairs" will always be part of my life. I so enjoyed my time there and it meant so much to me that obviously I took a lot of that into the next job, as I have taken part of "Upstairs, Downstairs" with me always. Oh, yes, I mean, this is the program I have to thank for my career. I'd been to a fortuneteller in Brighton, and she said, "You'll get a break, you'll get your break when you're wearing a long dress." Oh, I loved playing Daisy. She was, you know, a bit of a rebel and a bit tricky and a bit grumpy sometimes, and very vulnerable, of course, coming from an appalling background. I got loads of advice. "Oh, you mustn't put up with all that. Stand up to Mrs. Bridges." I never seemed to sort of crack it with the good-looking, young, female fraternity. It was always some little old lady with a blue rinse who wants to hug me and sit me on the edge of the mantelpiece and love me forever. "Upstairs, Downstairs" told the story of the life and changing times of one British family, the Bellamys, and their servants, from 1903 to 1930. The series was the idea of two actress friends, Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh. Jean played the faithful family maid, Rose. Eileen Atkins and I sat in her kitchen feeling a bit poor, and we thought, "Why don't we try to think of an idea for a television series?" And so then, over a period of weeks and months, we discussed various ideas, but always thinking that we would stick to what we knew. Eileen's parents were quite old when she was born. Her mother was 46 or 47, so her grandparents were very old, and she was showing me a stash of photographs from really almost the turn of the century, and there was a photograph of servants standing by a bus, and one of them was a great aunt or something, or maybe even only an aunt, and we thought we would write sort of little outlines I used to dream of all kinds of future for myself. I never thought I'd end up in service. It's not so bad. It's safe. You know where you are and what's going to happen next. The outside world is dangerous. Or perhaps it only seems so to us because we're ignorant. You know, if you could read and write, you would not be so frightened, and then perhaps you'd behave yourself. There are so many things I want to do and be, and time passes so quickly. You've got to learn to accept... They were not so far different from stage plays, so that the writer really had more... Had more power, had more control, had more influence, in fact, just made the whole thing up themselves. Very few people overlooking you or telling you what you could or couldn't do. The technology was more limited, so there was less you could do, but, in a way, I think there was much more energy and animation because we were all given such a free hand, really. To do long scenes that breathe and to have words is wonderful, and today, it really seems, you know, five sentences and they cut, five sentences and they cut, and I think that's very condescending to an audience's attention span. This was as good as live television. You were doing great, big 20-minute scenes without a break, and I just can't imagine that being the case now. You can actually hear the old camera sliding across the floor on some of them. You've got some very odd ideas about men, Rose. A technician's strike meant that some of the early episodes had to be recorded in black and white. I think you've got too much imagination. I haven't imagined the kind of life we're living here, living everything through them like we was vegetables that had no feelings, helping them put on their clothes, admiring their finery, wearing their stupid second-hand clothes. Well, I don't want a second-hand life, Rose! You see, the first series really established it. It was very strong, truthful, quite brave. Sit down and listen to me. I do my work as best I can because one day I mean to be a proper lady's maid to a proper lady. Now, Mr. Hudson runs this house like a clockwork machine, and Mrs. Bridges may be an old cow, but she cooks a dream, and her meals are a pleasure to put on the table. We're no bottom of the ladder, see? We're the wheels of the car, and we're content it should be so, 'cause the master's a proper gentleman what we really like and respect and does his work right in the Houses of Parliament. And my lady's a beauty and very genteel, and we feel that we, this whole house, is a part of London society. London society. It's the parrot house at the Zoological Gardens. London society, I said, and London society I meant. Now, that's the hub of the empire, innit? The empire on which the sun will never set. I had to turn myself upside-down, because in no way am I either a monarchist or an admirer of the empire. But Nicola Pagett had spent most of her childhood abroad, where she grew up surrounded by servants. I knew the attitude. Not that I had it as a child, because one lived in the kitchen as a child. Servants weren't people to be ordered about, they were the people you talked to. Because, I don't know, you talked... That's where the action was, in the kitchen. But I understood the concept of servants, so it wasn't something I had to research about how... I could watch adults ordering servants about. Don't cry, Miss Lizzie, please don't cry. It's not as bad as you think. You've got it all... - Don't you tell me, Rose. - Miss Lizzie? And don't call me Miss Lizzie. I'm a married woman, married, which is more than you'll ever be! What? At least I've tried! I've offered myself, but you, you've never offered yourself to anyone, so how can you give me advice? - I wasn't trying to. - You and Thomas. You think I didn't hear you late at night, teasing him and then stopping? Let me tell you, Rose, that unless you're prepared to give yourself utterly and risk making a fool of yourself, you'll never get anything in life! You'll end up withered here inside. I mean, look at you already! At least I'll never end up like you! And they wrote it for us, and we didn't know... I don't know that they knew, it was a sort of subliminal thing. They got to know the actors, and they wrote what they sort of felt we were like. So it was never that difficult to play the part. You never know, I don't think, with acting, how much of what is transmitting is something that's inherent in you or something that's built into the story and it's best you don't know. He was a sort of scowling creature, James, initially, and one of the reasons I think he never sort of smiled or laughed was because of this moustache. I've never liked the sort of restriction on the upper lip, literally the stiff upper lip, but actually, if you smile, you feel the spirit gum sort of cracking and you have a feeling it's going to come off. Not good things to have. I can only remind you, sir, that I believe the master would not wish it. Not today, sir. And let me remind you, Hudson, that whatever your private views may be, in the absence of my parents, I am in charge in this house. Now Miss Forrest is my guest for lunch. In the situation, I expect my orders to be obeyed. Yes, sir. Then do as you're told. Yes, sir. There's something in the way that people who are accustomed to being obeyed have a way of giving orders... to waiters, to butlers, to footmen... That is wonderfully imperious. I find it absolutely repulsive. A glass of water. I simply can't do that. I have to say, oh, excuse me... If you're passing the tap, could you possibly give me a glass of water? No, I, I... giving commands is not my forte, and I did try out for a chap called Peter Riley... Feel that, Peter Riley. This is your moment. And he had a way of giving orders... rather peevishly, and... But with absolute conviction he would be obeyed. "Get me a record token and run my bath." And he wouldn't... Never entered his mind that he wouldn't be obeyed. And I suppose he was the nearest I could find for a prototype. If you're going to believe in characters, you must have them show the black side of themselves. I mean, me, Jean Marsh, I'm vile as well as jolly and sweet, and you must have that, and I think we were allowed to early on. The first series sat on a shelf for six long months because London Weekend controller Cyril Bennett was convinced it would be a flop. And he said, "Well, I'm afraid they'll switch off in thousands. I'm sorry, it's very pretty, but it's just not commercial television." They put it on quite late at night because they didn't think anybody would be in the least interested in it. Just watching it and getting this sort of frisson and knowing you were really on to something and that everywhere all these people were watching it and feeling, "Well, that's rather good," or not wanting to turn off. Again, I mean, 25 years ago, there were fewer television programs, so if you had something on one of the channels, a lot of people would be watching it, and it did make an actual... Some sort of cultural impact. The series was a hit, but then, talk of an "Upstairs, Downstairs" film, though never made, caused a major character to quit. And everyone was going to be in it, and my character was going to be an American cousin and they were going to get rid of me, and I was so, I thought, "Right, even if they are, I'm not going to do another series," and I stuck to it too. It's really petty. In fact, with Nicola, with Elizabeth Bellamy, she'd done almost everything possible except stand on her head and read Greek that a young lady of quality could do in that period. Meanwhile, another upstairs actress was about to hand in her notice. I can't allow Mrs. Bridges to be carted off by the police. It would kill her. Besides, I have an important dinner party to give next week. How can you think about dinner parties at a time like this? Because I have to, Richard. So Rachel Gurney's Lady Marjorie was given a one-way ticket on the Titanic. I read the script and I said, "This is ridiculous." I said, "It's comical, it's so awful, it's so sentimental. How can you even do it?" And in one bit of the script, it had Lady Marjorie going down on the Titanic, and then soon after we knew she'd gone down, I think Patsy Smart, playing her maid, walked into the kitchen soaking wet, but she was soaking wet because it was raining outside, and I said, "Has she swum here?" Miss Roberts! Well, I was wrong. It's one of the most successful episodes, the Titanic one. Rachel Gurney lived on to regret her decision to leave. She said to me, "I think I've made an awful mistake." And I said, "What do you mean?" And she said, "I ought to be staying in this series." And I said, "Oh, Rachel, it's too late. Only Commodore Cousteau could give you a part now." Chris Beeny, Edward the footman, was nearly forced out of the series for good when he was involved in a terrible accident. And to be precise, November 27, 1972, at 9:30 AM, I met with a head-on collision on my motorbike. I met with a car. We generally assembled in the control room about 10:00 and started the dress rehearsal at 10:30, and all was fine, and there was a telephone there, and I'd never really looked at it before. I think it was red, and it was like the sort of one on the Prime Minister's desk, and the White House, and all that. I looked at it, suddenly it rang. We all did like this. And the body takes over, shock, and you don't know what's... And I knew I couldn't get up, for the one reason that my motorcycle boot was looking at my face like that, and my foot was still in it. I said, "How serious is it?" And they said, "Well, we aren't sure if he'll live 'til lunchtime." The only thing to do was to recast with a girl and say that the footman had gone on holiday. Casting director Martin Case suggested an actress called Jane Carr. By luck, she was at home when the phone rang. She was whisked to the studio and made up and dressed by about 1:00, and by 1:30, she was on the stage and had learnt her lines. There weren't all that number of lines, luckily. She didn't have a big part in that episode, and by 2:00, the cast involved very kindly had come back from their lunch hour and went through the scenes with her, and we started recording as usual and finished at 7:00, and that was that. Should we tell? No. It wouldn't do. You can only tell on people under you, not over you. I mean, they're all for writing me out. I mean, I can remember how they got over the episode is the fact that Mr. Hudson said, "You remember, my lord, Edward fell down and broke his leg and he is... It will be a while yet." And that was it. And as far as the public were concerned, never to be seen again. Practically every bone in my right-hand side was fractured or smashed. When I came back into series three, I couldn't run up and down stairs or hold trays. You know, joining "Up, Down," as we called it, could be a very daunting experience, a bit like belonging to a very exclusive club. I was christened Hazel Patricia. Hazel. Because you've got Hazel eyes. No... I think it was my father's love of shrubs that made him choose my name. That first episode, I remember very little of any of it. I think I did it in terror. I think I did the first three or four in terror. I was far too frightened to talk to anybody unless it was lines that I'd learned. I think what stopped the scariness and stopped it very fast was that, A, everyone was terribly kind, and B, the whole attitude of the series was nobody took themselves too seriously. I am responsible for the domestic running of the house, and I intend to stay here and help Ruby prepare the meals. Yes, you are responsible for running this house with dignity, as mother did, from upstairs, not messing about in the kitchen like a scullery maid! How dare you! You will do as I say and go up to the morning room. As my wife, you owe me obedience! Well, don't you owe me something? What? What's the matter with you? If you don't understand that, then perhaps it's just as well our baby died. Just as well. She was a very, very good influence on the series. It was a brilliant idea to bring in that middle-class element. I liked it very much when she got things wrong. That was quite good. I liked her because she was vulnerable and she was human. If you'll excuse me mentioning it, madame. Yes, Rose? Well, Lady Marjorie always used to say, "No diamonds in the country." Thank you, Rose. Except if it's for a big, formal party, or a ball, of course. These? Most appropriate. She worked very hard on her own makeup and props. She said, "Well, somebody like that won't have any really good taste and a terrible hairdo and too many bags and umbrellas and rings and things, which a lady wouldn't have." And she was quite right and did it... And gradually changed it as she got more firmly in the saddle at 165 Eaton Place, she gradually changed the hairdo, had less knickknacks, and became almost a lady. Another of the great characters was Ruby, the poor old kitchen maid. Ruby?! Ah, something nice for our supper, eh, Ruby? What in heaven's name is that? Well, it's for thickening the Irish stew, Mr. Hudson, for upstairs' dinner. Only, well, I can't read Mrs. Bridges's recipe. Her handwriting's all falling over. What can't you read? Well, it says, "Mix flour and add an ounce of" summat... That word there. Here, let me see. "Mix flour and add an ounce of butter and rub well." It's butter. Oh, I am daft. I thought it said "bitter." So I poured in a jug of ale. I'll have to start again, won't I? You certainly will, Ruby. I was an out-of-work actress at the time and very broke. When my agent told me I had the interview in Wembley, I panicked. I didn't have the money for the fare. So it was... those days, we had Green Shield Stamps and cigarette coupons, and I went to a little shop in Southhampton for my fare. At the end of the interview, I thanked them all for seeing me. I felt very sophisticated, very grand. I elegantly sailed out through the door, smiled at the very sophisticated receptionist, wandered out through the door, discovered I'd walked out through the wrong door. I was in the backyard, and I was too shy, too embarrassed to go back again. So I climbed over the wall. She was an innocent. She was conditioned not to think for herself. What's this? More tea, please, Mrs. Bridges. You've had two already. Well, Rose has had three. Two cups is quite enough for you. You keep your place, my girl. If Mrs. Bridges said, "Ruby, chop the parsley," she would chop the parsley. She wouldn't dream of washing it. I feel she was like a clown falling on the banana skin, constantly trying to please, wanting to please, and it never quite came off. I don't think I've ever met a more stupider girl than you, Ruby. You never listen. It goes in one ear, out of the other. And look at you. Just look at you. Torn stockings, dirty hands. I fell over on t'backstairs, Mrs. Bridges. Fell over? One day you'll fall and break your neck, and good riddance. Two of the best-loved cast members were Gordon Jackson, who played Hudson the butler... Named after a brand of Edwardian soap, would you believe... And the lovely Angela Baddeley. Dear old Angie. She played Mrs. Bridges the cook. Our guest of honor, Mrs. Bridges, is to be none other than His Majesty, King Edward VII. The King? Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India and the Dominions Beyond the Seas. - The King! - In person, and that's for your ears only at present, Mrs. Bridges. Oh, good gracious me, why ever didn't you say so? Oh, God bless my soul! The King of England is coming to dinner here? Oh! Well, firstly you say "Angela," and what comes what to me is this wonderful smell of attar of roses. She always... And it was a monumental character performance. There was this very petite, infinitely chic woman who would suddenly be padded up and with a wig and the padding and stuff would... Would really transform herself into this benign, little old cook. She was a stickler for detail because she knew that period so well, and she wouldn't let anybody get away with anything. If a word was out of period, if it was a modern word, she would say, "No, no, they never used that word in those days." And even with looking at the things we used for cooking, if there was something that wasn't of that period, she would say so. She had a good eye. Jenny Tomasin was very nervous always, and she did smoke quite a lot. And one day they were waiting... She was waiting to go on and she was smoking, and Angela was sort of beside me just before the scene started, and she said, "That Ruby... She smokes too much, that Ruby." And she'd forgotten she was actually Angela Baddeley. She was speaking in completely Mrs. Bridges's voice, which I thought was rather charming, really. There was always such a great smile when you walked in with Angela. Angela always cheered up the day. She knew everything about everybody, and in the cast too, and she would... We would sit together on this lumpy sofa at rehearsals like two good little women, swapping all the dirt. She was very amusing. You know, Edward, being in service is not unlike being in the army. Our masters, like the officers, are not always right, and they sometimes blame us for things which are not our fault. But we are not expected to answer back or to bear any grudges, because those are the terms we accept when we enter service. Maybe that's why I didn't like being in the army. He had an air about him that was just magic to watch, and I learnt so much. He was so direct, you know. "You're going to come in"... He was so... I mean, I think I'm precise. I like it... But he is just unh! And so exact. He was a perfect man to have as the kind of lead in a way. He very much held people together. He was a very, very kind man. He was very generous, he was very generous, sort of shoving me forward, things like that, if he thought there was a shot that I could get. Gordon came up to me with a box of chocolates, said, "Oh, it's your first-night present." And I said, "Oh, thank you, Gordon, it's very kind of you, but it's only a small part," and Gordon said, "There are no small parts, only small actors." And he was so right, and I've based my whole career on that. He was a very, very nervous actor. He would learn his lines mainly before he came to rehearsals, which we didn't, and the whole process made him very, very anxious, and once we knew this, we were very protective of him. We would keep an area of quiet around him or we would run through lines, just to look after him, to make his life as peaceful as possible. If he could see what you were trying to do as an actor, he would find a way of getting it... of helping you to it. And he would just every now and then say, "Try it looking out the window, or"... Just a little, tiny something, and you think, "Oh, yes." Let me put it this way... You couldn't be bad with Gordon Jackson. Between them, Hudson and Mrs. Bridges ruled their own tiny empire... The kitchen. The kitchen was a good place to be, around the kitchen table, during rehearsals or even in the studio days, because they'd all be down there quite like the sort of show, kind of bitching about the visiting artists and life in general and things. We had lovely, untidy, real brown loaves and socking great lumps of cheese, real cheddar, big slabs of butter. It was all much healthier. The eggs and bacon cooked by Angela Baddeley, you know, on the set, there was a practical thing, and the poor upstairs people had grouse that had gone off, and all their food was painted with glycerin to make it look good, and it was sitting around forever, and they would come on to our set and say, "Can we have some bread and cheese?" And we'd say, "No, go away, it's ours." You know, "Be off with you." And after we'd finished a take, we would continue eating, much to the dismay of the camera crew, who would immediately, "Silence on the floor. Stop clattering those knives and forks around." Perhaps the most famous and repeated "Upstairs, Downstairs" episode told of the night the King came to dinner. It was based partly on its writer's personal experience. Well, yes, there was an occasion where the Prince of Wales, Edward VIII Prince of Wales, came to dinner often in our house, and one had a sort of vague idea of remembering the maids sort of practicing curtseying and all that sort of thing. We were all sort of sent for downstairs when he came to tea or came in for a drink after playing golf with my stepfather. We used to produce our exercise books like children did, and he used to look through all these pages of sums and mathematics and things and say, "Jolly good, you know, jolly good, you know," and that, so when we got upstairs to the nursery, my brother and I used to call him "Jolly good, you know." We all learned how a household prepared for something that grand and how hard they worked. And we were shown the details, too. That was the great thing. And we had people from Buckingham Palace to come and show us what to do and how to stand and where to go. Angela looked at me and said, "Jenny, we're far too tidy, both of us, and you especially." Makeup came along, "Oh, no, no, no, you're absolutely perfect." Angie and I looked at each other and went... no. Is that done then, Mrs. Bridges? Oh, stop asking silly questions, girl. And give me the vinegar, quick. She wouldn't have had time to be tidy. So Angie and I just threw egg all over ourselves, flour. I dipped my hand in flour and went like that, pulled my hair out, 'cause I'd got tufts of hair. It was too late for makeup to do anything about it. The cameras rolled and we did it. No! No! He can't! He can't be dead! He can't be dead! He's the only man I've ever loved! He can't be dead! He can't be! At the end of the fourth series, "Upstairs, Downstairs" was everywhere. Its estimated worldwide audience was 300 million. And in Britain, it was never out of the top ten. You could buy the books, the music, the magazines... You could even buy the marmalade. I believe that the crew used to ask to be on "Upstairs, Downstairs," and then one of the most rewarding, really rewarding things, was that they would come to rehearsals that they didn't have to go to just to be in on what we were doing and to get ideas, and it was not unusual for me to be approached by not just the leading cameraman or the leading sound but other members of the crew to say, "Jean, if you could get further towards the table, we can get a much better shot of you." When you work in the theater, the audience is the last member of the cast. But when you work well on television, the crew is the last member of the cast. And that was true about "Upstairs, Downstairs." In those days, you had these vast studios with almost like theater sets, and you'd go from one room to another. So, yes, they were very atmospheric, and of course all the things were absolutely genuine and wonderful paintings and bits of silver and genuine old clutter down in the kitchen and pots and pans, and yes, it really helped enormously, and everything was... It was rather like being in a theater in some ways, actually. They used to bring cakes and stuff in, and I remember that Angela brought lots of cakes in. Maybe it was because she was a cook. We used to work 'til 3:00 and exist on kind of biscuits and stuff. And here we were, rehearsing on the King's Road. And we had... I mean, I'd never had money like this before. Not that it was... I mean, looking back, it wasn't much at all, really, but to me, it seemed untold wealth, and we'd go shopping and we were very trendy and had the platform shoes and the glitter. It was the days of David Bowie and silver outfits, and we were... yes, we were, I suppose, fairly outrageous one way and another. The worst thing about playing him was having the short hair. The short hair was just appalling. Everyone had long hair. If you had short hair in the pub in those days, people thought you must have come out of prison. For Jean Marsh, it was her short sight that caused problems. As I was cutting these sandwiches, I cut myself, didn't notice it. There was blood on the bread, the bread were like doorsteps. Sometimes the cucumber was thicker than the bread, and the cameraman very wisely slowly panned away from the sandwiches and kept on my face, so you saw my shoulders very busily, and then when it was over and they said cut, there was a shriek of laughter from the entire studio when I looked... and then I looked down at this pile of mangled and bloody bread and... it was disgusting. I need a new dress. I need lots of new dresses. The corsets are fab, they really are. A, you fill really attractive because your waist is like that, you know, so you feel very feminine, and you've got to sit up straight because you don't have to think about how you walk, because you can't walk any other way than properly and you can't sit any other way but properly. I couldn't sit like this in a wing collar, I'd have to sit like this, so this automatically changes your attitude anyway. The program had a powerful effect on people, and especially for the cast, the divide between fact and fiction was often blurred. I remember one woman barging in front of me in Sainsbury's. I said, "Excuse me." I'd only just popped to get something I'd forgotten, and she got in front of me, and she said, "Well, that will teach you to be so horrid to Hazel." And I went... When we used to go into the studio, the crew would say, "" Ello, Jenny, good morning, Jenny, good morning, Jean," and all that. "Good morning, Mr. Langton. Good morning, Miss Gurney." There was definitely a hierarchy, it has to be said. Maybe we were on the defensive because we were playing servants and wanted to play posh, I don't know. There may be an element of that. It's a reflection on the effect it has on people. We're all equal actors. We're all sort of, you know, and there we'd be sort of better. Jean used to find it very rankling, I think. There were working-class dressing rooms and upper-class dressing rooms, and it's... I know it's pathetic, but the upper-class dressing rooms had corners and windows and free paper handkerchiefs, and the other ones had no windows and no paper handkerchiefs, and I never got one, and I thought we should always have a turn, and one day I went into the studio and I lost my rag. I just said... and I think I lost my accent as well. I used my old one, I said, "Look. Rachel Gurney may be playing Lady Marjorie, but she isn't a bleeding lady, you know, and I thought of the idea. I think occasionally I might get a corner room with a window and free Kleenex." And actually the man, you know, who doled out the keys, he said, "Fair dues, Jean, fair dues." So ever after, we took it in turns to have the posh dressing rooms. The downstairs people would do all the work the stage management should have been doing, like changing all... 'cause, you know, the strawberries have to go down on that line and the turkey has to come in on that line for the cameras so it's all the same, and we'd have to do it again and again, and John and Pauline would be clearing up and the stage manager just sitting like that, because they were servants. John threw everything on the floor, the knives and forks. He said, "What am I doing?" He threw it on the floor once. "I'm an actor, this isn't my job." It was a sort of subliminal thing. There are two families living in this house. There's us, the Bellamys, and then there's the family downstairs, with father Hudson, mother Bridges, and their son Edward, who's in the army now, and so proud of him we are. Then there's the eldest daughter Rose, who lost her young man at the front. And the two youngest daughters. No, one's a daughter-in-law, Daisy. Married to Edward. Who lives with her in-laws. Yes. Then Ruby, the youngest, rather... simple. A child. Perhaps one day we'd all be one big family, not two. In 1974, "Upstairs, Downstairs" became the first major television series to dramatize the Great War. For many of the cast and crew, it was a personal as well as professional story. I know when my mother died, we went through her... All her jewelry and stuff, and I think there were six regimental badges that people had given her before they went back to the front, and I think she was engaged to about four or five of them. My father was killed in France in the trenches before I was born, two months before I was born, and all through my childhood, I used to dread Armistice Day, because mother was always upset and in tears and we used to have to go to the cenotaph for years and years, and I always hated it because it always meant tears and drama. One thing, though. It's not just me, is it? I mean, well, we're all in this together. Hundreds and thousands of us. Daisy? And I thought, the nearest I can get to my own personal experience was my father. He was at Ypres and then went over the top, and he was shot through the face. And it's very difficult to get someone who's been through that to actually open up, and he really wouldn't or didn't want to talk about it, but I got a few horrific things about loyalty. And Charlie Wallace... my pal, my best man. We'd just got back to duty. Big, heavy shell burst right beside him. He was trying to cut a gap in the Boche wiring. He went right up in the air. When the smoke cleared, we saw him hanging there on the wire with his arm off. Just up out there all night, moaning. I think there were millions of interesting facets and themes in that war series. It was certainly our best. I think that that series would stand up as a series about the First World War rather than a series of "Upstairs, Downstairs." And I remember a scene in the dining room. There can't be any argument, any dispute that is worth so many people's lives. So much blood. There's something monstrous, evil, mad about it all. And it's all bolstered up by people here not knowing what it's really like, like some... arsed confidence trick. You see, even now, I can't really tell you how awful it is. We perpetuate the lies even from out there. The letters I've written to the wives and mothers of my men. "He died like a man, instantly and in no pain. His supreme sacrifice will not be in vain." I haven't written a single letter that didn't have one of those lies in it. And all the time, you see, it seems to me clearer and clearer that they died for nothing. It was breathtaking, really, and I had some letters from people who had obviously been suffering in isolation for decades, and the letters from them, saying, "You expressed exactly what I went through." I'll always remember Simon in that scene. Always. I understood and sympathized with what the war did to James and I became quite a lot more affectionate about him, and having slagged him off all over the place, I then got rather defensive about him. And looking back on him, I'm really quite fond of him now. But the only character actually to die in the Great War was not James or Edward, but poor, fragile Hazel. In fact, it was the first character in the whole series, and I think almost the only one, that I had to say, "I'm awfully sorry, you're going to die." And it may sound quite funny, really, but it wasn't. I was very, very upset by it, and I didn't know how to tell Meg Wynn, who was putting her whole heart into things then, so enthusiastic about the part, you know, really, so I asked her to lunch at Simpson's-in-the-Strand, and I think I waited 'til almost the cheese and had another glass of wine and glass of port and all that, and eventually I said, "I've got some bad news, I'm afraid. Hazel's going to die in the flu epidemic of 19..." And she said, "Oh, don't worry." She was very good... "I did see you've done almost everything you could with Hazel." I asked if I could have a dramatic leave-taking, and so they gave me the best... I died of flu. I didn't believe... I mean, none of us believed that there was a real place for Hazel in the '20s. Her journey had been completed. The last series brought the Roaring '20s to life... Everything from flappers and flying to silent movies and the General Strike. James, we lost four years of our youth when we had to be miserable and frightened and watch all our friends being killed one by one. Well, they're dead, and there's nothing we can do about it. So, let's forget it and have some fun, please? All right, we'll have fun. We'll have the most stupendous party ever seen. Of course we couldn't age or we'd be dead, and when we changed the style into the '20s and my... I had to have a wig of, you know, short, bobbed hair, well, I didn't age, I youthed, because it suited me. I wondered if people were watching, thinking, "That woman is now 102." We called it "Peter Panning," and so we never put tremendous lines on... Or tried, really, to make them old, and I don't think anyone noticed or minded, and I think it was the right decision, really. But the passing years did cause real credibility problems for father and son characters Richard and James, actors David Langton and Simon Williams. I figured that I should be around 50 by the time we finished and was putting in a substantial amount of gray hair and sort of trying to make James a bit older, and he'd be in the adjoining makeup chair sort of taking out the gray, and I'd be putting it in, and so we sort of ended up looking more like contemporaries, and he didn't... I didn't think he quite approved of that. Mother lived in a different age. We've moved on, there's been a war! Oh, don't use the war as an excuse. The war's got nothing to do with this. - Oh, hasn't it? - We fought the war to keep your mother's world, to preserve certain standards of decent behavior. You're talking like an old fool! What? How dare you! A hopeless... Yes, James, that is the word exactly, "hopeless." - What do you mean? - You, boy, everything you do seems to come to nothing... Why? Can you tell me why you, with all your advantages, does it always end the same? Robert Powell had said it's a very good thing to die in a major series, and so when they said we're going to do a post-war series, a last series, I said, "Yes, as long as I can die," and they said, "We've got a great idea." Eternal loser James ended his life in a Maidenhead hotel, and millions of viewers were left in shock. And 165 Eaton Place was no exception. Oh, by the way, we used to put a "1" in front of the "6" when we filmed it. After James's death, the house was sold off and the series came to an end. Despite higher viewing figures than ever before, cast and crew all felt they should quit while they were ahead. When we all decided to finish "Upstairs, Downstairs," London Weekend controller Cyril Bennett was furious. He went mad nearly. He said, "You can't, you're absolutely... You're letting the company down, you're..." I mean, he was really very rude to me indeed, and he said, "It's absolutely monstrous. You've gone quite mad. It's a gold mine that's plenty more to be dug out," and all that, and then he pleaded and he said, "Look. Here's a contract," he said, "for the next ten years. You can do two half hours a week." But he used to say to me, "Don't go, don't go, we'll call it 'The Rose Show. "" "We'll double your salary. We'll do all sorts of things." I don't think he was serious. "Upstairs, Downstairs" was an award-winning, much-loved international television triumph. It was a very new area for a series, to look at servants as people, make them human. There was a whole society going on. Nobody was lonely. There was enough to eat. You were warm, you were fed. So I think watching the program, whoever you were, whether you were a duke or someone who was desperately out of work, it sort of made you feel safe. I mean, it was a fantasy, but there was this house in which everyone was included and everyone was all right. I do believe a great strength of "Upstairs, Downstairs" is that you can dip into it again. It's like a book you can re-read, a classic book. And you can re-look at one episode or five and still find new things in it and enjoy the familiar. The whole thing was a very happy business, and I think friendships, deep friendships can be made in the heat of battle. You know, it somehow is a special sort of friendship, and certainly making "Upstairs, Downstairs" was a battle, and I think we all became great friends, a special sort of friends, through that. It was a remarkable cast. The generosity, the help... People would give you little clues and little hints. There was no feeling of jealousy or resentment. It was a lovely last episode for me, really. Very moving and really thrilling. The intention in "Upstairs, Downstairs," the talent of everybody shows on the screen. It was simply very good of its kind. ♪ Oh, what are we going to do with Uncle Arthur? ♪ ♪ A blinkin' stallion is Uncle Arthur ♪ ♪ And when he goes a-strollin' in the park ♪ ♪ Watch your step, girls, especially after dark ♪ ♪ Any old skirt's a flirt for Uncle Arthur ♪ ♪ He's over 80, but how he can run! ♪ ♪ "Give us a kiss, me dear," he'd say ♪ ♪ And tickle you up the boom-di-ay ♪ ♪ And say it was just an harmless bit ♪ ♪ A nice bruise on you where you sit ♪ ♪ A "Let me go, Uncle Arthur!" kind of fun ♪ ♪ Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media
