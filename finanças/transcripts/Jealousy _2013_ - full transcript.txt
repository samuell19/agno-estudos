Don't do this. Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone. - I have to go. - No! Don't leave me. Bring me with you. I can't. I kept the angels. Did it go well? It was... like any other day of work. Did you bring me some... I haven't been paid for the rehearsal yet. Do you remember? We were sure we could earn a loving by doing things we like. At least you're trying. - Yes, but... - She's right. - I'm struggling. - She knows it. Wait and see... Stop shouting. My ears hurt. We're not shouting. Well... See you later then. Later. It's beautiful, isn't it? - Dad created it for me. - Really? It's great. Did he do it? No that's me. I helped him because his was not so good. It's beautiful. How was your day at school? Dad did the hair. I colored it violet. And we did the water drop together. - I did this? - Did he do this? No, that's me too. He did this line here. I did this line. He did the hair-work. He did the helmet. But it's not finished. I thought it was earphones so I did this. Now it doesn't work. - Do you wanna go home? - I like walking with you. This is where you kissed me for the first time. It was intense. I was so scared I was shivering. - I'm cold. - You're cold? We'd better go home. - That's too easy! - You're cheating with your big legs! - I'm sorry. - Yeah, sure... Don't put your shoes on the bed. It's disgusting. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for Dad. Thank you. Are you ok? How did it go? Yeah. He was great with Lucie. - Lucie? Who's this? - She's playing my sister. I've never heard of her. Luckily she's your sister. - It doesn't stop feelings. - That's right. How is she? I don't know. Normal. Normal? She's sublime. Her body... The body doesn't matter. The face does. The eyes? Why do we always look at the eyes first? It's more the facial contour, the cheekbone... I see. She's like a bolete. What?! How are you, my swine? Yeah. I'm just a little cold. - You're what? - A little cold. Really? You're cold? Here. Put the coat on. Is it better now? Yes. Well. Here is your bag. So? When can I see you again? Soon. I always have a key of the place you're staying at. - Thank you. - Bye. You know... I've always been afraid I couldn't give you this book. Before I die. The essential. Say you're going to die once more and I'll kill you. You don't know how delighted I'd be. That's not funny. It's never funny with her. Seneca. An old man like me. Wise men live as long as they can. But not as long as they should. What is good with life is that it doesn't force anyone to go on with it. Yeah. Thinking that I could have died twice. What do you mean? The bypasses. Two opportunities to die I missed. Did you invite us to talk about your funeral? Little Claudia is waking up. Well. Seneca, if everything's fine and you didn't change too much... We could share it. Like Mayakovsky? It's completely different. But, yes, share it like Mayakovsky. That'd be great. I'd love it. - When do we start? - Calm down, sweety. I'll start alone. Then I'll tell you. Don't you mind? Not at all. We won't change our habits for him. The first time I saw Claudia, she was... - 18 or 19. - I looked like a fool. Such an enthusiast. Like me tell you're gonna ruin it. I had read his great biography of Mayakovsky. I felt in love with Mayakovsky. I went to the museum in Moscow. I went for a pilgrimage. There... I ran into its statue and I kissed it. I have a picture of this. Then one day... I was signing books. I saw this tall and uncombed girl coming. She handed my her picture. I looked so crazy he invited me for a dinner. Good. My dear friends... Please forgive me. You may stay here if you want. But I have to take a nap. I know it is to you I owe the empire, Without your care so often to repeat it Your bounty, Madam, with tranquility Might safely on my gratitude repose. Your discontents, so openly declared, Have led indeed your hearers to suspect That in my name 't was for yourself you labour'd. Yourself you labour'd. Yourself you labour'd. Not so loud. I can't. It's the minimum. - You want me to go out? - No. I like you being here. Such honors, they have said, such deference, Are they for nothing counted in her sight? - It looks like he actually despise you. - Totally! - Admit it excites you. - A little bit. Hi! - Come. - No, I can't. - Don't be shy. - I'm not shy. This is Lucie, a great actor. She's Esther, my little sister. Antoine! Let me introduce you to my sister. Hi little sister. Let's go Louis it's our turn. Wait for me here. I'll be right here. Roger! Where do you sleep? At Vincent's place. Really? When did it start? A year ago. - How many fights do you have each week? - None! - No fight? - No. He's smart. Even smarter than you. - Really? - Yes. So I said: "Listen..." "I'll think about it." I'll call you in two years. I swear. Are you ok? Excuse me. I'll explain later. Are you here? Yes. Where am I supposed to be? I've been scared I've been so scared... - Scared of what? - I thought you left. Were could I go? I don't know. I was just scared. - You're fine? - Great. - How did it go? - He was very kind. So? So I have the job. And there is another project he wanna talk to me about. That's great. He wants to see you again. Don't be so thrilled Louis. I haven't played for 6 years. The dialogs... Let's go. - Let's go. - Yes. Thank you. I haven't lost heart but I need support. I believe in you. What time is it now? I'm so late! I must go to the theater. See you later. Ok? I'm very late. I swear I'm late. I'm really late. Let me go or I'll get a bollocking. I'll be late. Please. See you later. See ya. What am I thinking about? - Right now? - Yes, now. The next round? - No. - No? But you're close. Yesterday party? I want to change job. I'll transform myself. Well, try yoga. I'm tired of working at night. It's exhausting. And I have no social life. There's a lot of people here. I do meet people. But they are not real friends. Stop complaining. One always complains about what one needs. - You never complain? - No. I can't afford it. May I? Please don't ask my name. - Or if I often come here. - What? Don't ask my ask. Or if I often come here... That'd be vulgar. It's get me down off my cloud. Then we'll get along well. I love secrets. Hidden words. I need a cigarette. Don't you? I haven't smoked for a while. Neither did I. Damn it! What's wrong? I banged into the cupboard. - Where are you going? - Don't know. Wait, I'm coming with you. There is nothing to laugh about. I'm not laughing. I just want to go with you. I can't stand this rat hole anymore. What? Ra thole? Where are you going? Calm down. It's nothing. You just banged into a cupboard. Sandra is going to wreck us. She can't if we love each other. Love each other? We don't love each other. Do you wanna break up with me? Is she your wife? Is she your wife? - Is she your wife? - Shut up. - Is she? - Shut up! She has to be your wife. Hi. Hi. You have a nice hat. You like it? Give it a try. Not bad. Let's have a look. Here, look. What do you think? - Perfect. - Yes. Let's leave it here. Thank you! Let's go then. Loser. - What did you say? - Scooter. Loser? Let's ride scooter with this loser. Wait, wait. You're kicking me?! In your ass! Dad, will you buy me a lollipop? - What? - A lollipop! No, you just ate a cake. You can't eat all the time and we should save money. Look at the park! Thanks! Come on. Hey, what is this lollipop? - Nothing. - Did you steal it? - No. I just took it. - One mustn't do that! Don't do this. Don't steal! I'm not kidding. Don't steal lollipops. Don't be like Claudia. I'm not kidding. Neither am I. You stole a lollipop! I just took it. - Don't laugh at me. - She took it! Don't laugh at me. - Dad! - Let's return it. - Ok. - Let's go. - Let's go. - We'll return it. - Was it good? - Yes. Let me finish it. We're going to return it! - Ok, I give up. - What? I give up. - What are you giving up? - Forget it, let's go. Let me finish it. Then I'll return it. - I have to finish it first. - And you'll return the stick? Two swines. I used to have one. No I have two. We can look for a third one. You mind is so corrupted. I can't believe it. It's disgusting! So? - Whose hat is this? - It's mine. Could you help me? How was it with Dad? You went for a walk? - Yes. - Where? I don't remember. - Did you meet Dad's girlfriend? - Yes. So... Was she kind to you? She's so cool! You know what we ate? - No. - A collective sandwich. It's bread, ham, cheese... It's very crunchy. I took a bite first. Then Dad. Then Claudia. And so forth. It's good. You know it? Yes, I see. Oops! Thanks. Also... Forget it. It's a secret. - Really? - Yes. What? Don't you have secrets? I can have some too. Well... - Mom? - Yes? Are you still in love with Dad? Not at all. Off course, I'm so dumb. He already has a lover. Luckily you don't have one. Why do you think so? But... Who broke up? You or Dad? Sweety, I already told you a thousand times. I always forget. Can't help it. Too bad for you. Why are you fighting? - You're ok? - Yes. - How was your day? - Fine. What did you do? Well... I cooked the soup. That doesn't take a whole day. Since you woke up, you didn't cook non-stop. I went shopping, I cleaned the kitchen... I peeled the carrots... And I cleaned your room, too. - But it wasn't in a mess. - A little bit. There was only 3 toys on the ground! I had to clean up so as to vacuum. Weren't you could during the walk? No, I had that big coat. I wore hot clothes. And a hat... A new hat. What's the dessert? Clementines. It's an orange meal today. - Magic carpet? - Do it. Time to sleep now. You're tired. - Mom. - Yes. Would you agree to make a collective sandwich with me? If you like it. There. Sweet dreams. Wait! Mom! Wait! - What? - Don't close the door. The door? Like this? Yes, thanks Mom. Good night. - I wonder if my mother had problems. - At her old job? - She's been fired. - Who? - My mother. Dumped like an old sock. - Really? - Yeah, but lot of people got fired. I think they left themselves. Hi girls! Wait, I'll go with you. Bye guys. Ciao. You're going out with me? Great new! I'm just going with you. - But I can kiss you if you want. - I'd like it. I couldn't feel anything. Of course, it was a brief kiss. I can't. You know it. I can't. I know who I am. It's been a long time. It's a chance but also a pain. And I know I love you. I love what you are and how you think. I love you. I love you. Definitely. I love you forever. Really, it was... Brilliant when you danced. It was a demonstration of reasons to love you. There is no such reasons. You made me doubt it. It's heavy! Work well. Bye. Bye. Do you love me? Do you? You're the one leaving. Yeah, yeah... It's the last time. A few days without you and I completely lost my mind. I like it. It's crazy. Like my subconscious is linked to you. If one of us is cheating. Should he tell the other one? You have a complex mind. No. It's better knowing. Wouldn't you wanna know? I just need you to love me. Your love. And the two of us being happy. Are we happy. We're perfectly good. It's almost ideal. Well, I think so too then. - Can I sleep at your place? - Sure. That's the desert rule. What? - You don't know the desert rule? - No. When you're in the desert... - If someone asks for hospitality... - Yes? You must accommodate him for 3 days and 3 nights in your tent. Then the person must go. This is the desert rule. Who told you that? Dad. When you were a kid? Yeah. I have no memory of him. It's normal. You were too young. When he died. I can't do it. Here. Here. Excuse me. You know, I've been in love with your father. He loved me too. Today, I still love him a lot. Good bye. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Fine. Claudia... Henri - Good evening. - Good evening. - Let's go. - Yes. - So you're a comedian too. - I used to be. - I'm not so good. - She's a great actress. But she doesn't have a job right now. - Are you doing anything else? - I should try. If you're interested... I'll explain. So? Do you wanna drink something? Or should I invite you to dinner? - Why not. - My car... Where were you?! What? I was with Sabine. Really? I ended at her place. I have good news. - Really? - I may have found a job. Great! What is it? It's not a play. Sabine has a friend who's looking for an archivist for his office. What? You can't stop acting! I'd just have a break. For some time. That's how it starts. Then... Don't you want me to earn money? We may move house. I do. But not at any price. You heard how he called her? - I can't say it. - Why? It's taboo. Why is Ismael taboo? Because of Israel? No. - You don't like it. - I love it! You can't change it now. Stop talking like you can. True. I went to the city hall. Yes! Now it has to be Ismael. Welcome Ismael. - You have a boy. What's his name? - Albert. "B?bert". - How old is he? - 11. - Are you still with his mother. - Yes I am. - Is she rich? - Very rich. Can't you wait? Claudia hasn't arrived yet. - Who's that? - His wife. - An actress? - A great actress. Her problem is she can't walk because of her wings. - Why ? She's too tall? - Stop kidding. She hasn't played for years. Because she's too intelligent, too sensitive. Yes, that's not what you need for this job. - That's why I worry. - Don't. She will find work. Then you can start worrying. That I don't care. But she must work. You like her abnegation. But she may leave you if she works. That would be easily settled. I'd shoot me right away. What's wrong? Everything's fine! Look! I can't stand it anymore. I can't stand this place anymore. It's ugly and sad. I need light. And space. And cheerfulness. I can have troubles but I can't be poor. What do you want me to do? I don't know. Get a move on. Wait for me here. - Bye. - Bye. You're onto a winner there! The door... What? - What ? - What's written on the ticket? Stop! Give it to me! Her phone number. Call her. No. I'll throw it away. - No! Give it! - What? - Don't throw it away. - You already have a step-mother. You want a second one? No, but I may need a babysitter. - What's this? - What? This. "Sorry about yesterday" - "I don't know what's gotten into me..." - Wait! Sorry about yesterday. I don't know what's gotten into me. I'm having trouble. Don't blame me. I'm lost but I'll get better. You must be patient. Sorry. Sorry and sorry again. I love you. What's wrong? - What's wrong? - I don't know. - You're jealous. - No! - You are. - No. - Yes you are. - No I'm not. Say it : "I do am, O venerable father." I'm not jealous! "You're everything I have" Admit it. - That's wrong. - Say it. That's wrong! Know what you need? - Tell me. - The attack. Stop it! Stop or I'll hit you. Stop it now. Stop. Take off your coat. I already took it off. No, I didn't. I'll take it off. Here, you dumbo. You love hugs, right? That's what you need. Do you know who my father loves most? It has to be you. No. It's his dad. No. I already told you. But Mom said it. I know. What did I told you? I told you Jean-Pierre went far away when I was young. That I missed him a lot. But I don't love him more than you. You understand? Yes. Hey. We're here. - You're fine? - Yes. Esther... No?... - Pleased to meet you. - Hello. - Let's eat. - Yes. I was sleeping. Two friends were smoking a spliff. Some fell on a cardboard. Then it burnt. - Everything? - Only the storage room. - You were there? - Me? - Yes. - I was asleep. - You're were asleep. - So I went down tell my mother. She went up and extinguished the fire. She took the duvet and put water on it. Then she spread it. What woke up up? Me? Nothing. Okay. - You've been lucky. - Yes. - Well... - What? What a story. I'm shocked. I have to make a call. I'll be back. - You want his cr?me br?l?e? - Yes. - Here. - Thanks. Do you like him? Nice. He's a great guy. I can see it. But... You're friends? - Just friends? - Don't imagine things. I don't. But you are so enthusiastic. Especially you. I need to know. - No? - Yes. I still need... 2 hours. I'll be there around 4. Is it ok? Yeah. Don't worry. I'll hurry. Ok? I love you. See you later. Ok. Later. - It's delicious. - Really? It won't stop her loving you. No but she has her own way to love me. She loves you as much as she can. Like everyone else. We all... Have a personal story. Barriers... Fears... Hitches... Limits to love. No. - I have no limits. - Be careful. It's dangerous. You're an actor. You... You can play a role Listen, Louis. Maybe you understand fiction better than... Real life. Yeah? Maybe. Never thought of this. We're here. I'll show you something. It was planned but you'll love it. Done with troubles. What do you think about this? - I don't know. Whose place is it? - Mine. What do you mean? It can be yours too. I don't get it. There's nothing to get. Happy? Where does it come from? You won a lottery ? Got an inheritance? It's a gift. I'm lucky. I don't know. That person must love you a lot. Probably. You don't even deny it. How many friends like this do you have ? I'd like to know. You know it. It's the same for you. No it's not. - I hate liars. - I'm not lying. Everybody lies. That's the terrible thing. We all want to live great thing. Nobody wants to wait. Wait is death. I need to be alive until the end. What are you talking about? This sounds so idiotic What are you saying? I'm living with you. You're the one I love. I need you. It hurts to imagine you with someone else. So don't imagine. Live with me when we're together. Then stop thinking about it. I'm with you when I need it. It's alright. Why are you so harsh? I'm not harsh. You have no money and I offer you a home. It's not harsh. How could I live at someone else's place? He's ok with it. He's a good guy. Are you trying to hurt me? - Why are you? - I don't want to hurt you. I thought you'd be happy. Fuck! - Louis! - I'm coming. - Hurry up! - Yes, I'm coming. - You're bleeding! - I'm ok. Go! Go! Hurry up! So you got a Porsche? Yes I did. It's an old one. I didn't know. Who knew? No one knew? Ok, listen... I got an old Porsche. 2L. 1969. Well, I got to go. After studying French I went to the Gers and trained for auto racing. So I'm setting up Porsche. Did you race? No, I didn't. - So you... - No I didn't... - It was a preparation - Yes. No. Actually I was... a flunky. I take care of rich people's cars. You learn the maintenance... It's interesting. So you're a pro about mechanism. Yeah, sure... - Didn't you drove a bit? - Just a little bit. Thanks! Bye! Thanks! Ciao! Bye! Then she told me : "You think that's cruel?" So I answer : "Yes I do but I'm immune, it's ok." But when she started, I realized that... I felt ashamed. I became red-faced. - What are you doing? - I'm leaving. Where are you going? I'm going. I'm leaving you. What do you mean you're leaving me? I'm leaving you. Just like that. What should I do? - Is that so important? - Is it a game? - Stop it. - What? Stop. What are you doing. It's over, Louis. I'm sorry. It's over. - Are you going to meet him? - Yes. If you knew, why did you pretend tonight? Don't make it complicated. I have to go. I hope you won't regret it. Are you sure? What should I say? Time has to fly. I'll call you. Maybe she won't come. Stop torturing yourself. She's blowing hot and cold. It hurts. I know. - I brought clean clothes. - Stay sited. Maybe she won't come. Maybe she's afraid of saying it's over. Because of what happened. It's must be difficult for her. She loves you. She can't just dump you. Sometimes she come. Sometimes she doesn't. I think she doesn't know what to do. I'm here, bedridden and waiting. And she must be with that guy now! Fuck it! I'm depending of her calls and visits. I can't stand it. - I love you, brother. - What time is it? 3:50 PM Should I leave her? Yeah, maybe. It'll free you. You have to be courageous. When you find the strength. But I love her. What about the play? - You've been replaced. - By who? - Long live liberty ! - Lucie! - Louis! - How are you? Fine. - I'm happy to see you. - Me too. - Is she your daughter? - Yes. Charlotte. Come and say hello. - Hi Charlotte. - She's Lucie. What's new? Nothing. Just hanging with my daughter. And you? I've been picked for a play. - Good. - Yes. - We'll do a 2 months tour. - Fantastic! Yes it is. What are your plans? Well, it's too soon to talk about it. Ok, good. Call me some time. - Don't forget. - You're beautiful. - Thanks! - Bye. - Bye. - Can I continue? - Yes. In others cities, others horses hear him and strike up... Long live liberty! All the men on the continent... - You don't know it. - I do. All the men from islands and continent... Hear shouts and wonder what it is. Are you cold? A little bit. I'm fine. What's your best friend?s name again. Maroua. Maroua what? Majko. Maroua Majko. - Are you still friends? - Of course. - But... yes. - Why? - Why what? - Why the "but"? What is it? I have some questions to ask. - Really? - Yes. Which ones? In example... My birth, you know. - Your birth? - Yes. - What's the question? - What did you do before I was born? Before you were born I hanged out with my friends, I worked... Why didn't you want a child? I don't know. I thought... You're an idiot. It's enough. When I saw you it was love at first sight. Yeah, sure... - Can you do it? - I'll manage. These are for you. Here. It's yours. And this is for you. Thanks darling. And you? What about having a a baby with Vincent? I'd love to. But... But what? I need money. You can have babies without money. But it's more difficult. True. Louis. The peanuts are good. It's a pain. It's a pain but it's good. Here. Here. For my Dad again. Thanks dear. You're welcome.
