l won't forgive the interest amount. Repay the entire amount within a week. Yes? Find out if the blueprint for the new house is ready. Where did you go? Mother was asking about you. - Why, sister-in-law? - l don't know. - Where is she? - Upstairs. - Yes, mother. - Did you visit your aunt? - Oh, l forgot. - That's obvious. l was mistaken in thinking you'd take care of family business. Mother, l'll surely go there on my way back from work. - Don't forget to go. - l'll surely go. Oh. Looks like the sun has risen from the west. May l ask the reason for your absence yesterday? - Why aren't you answering? - Wait. You've given me such difficult problems, l can't solve them. You won't. The questions are simple, but you're a dud. Sure. lnstead, why not admit you're just a bad teacher? How can l teach? You come one day and are absent the next three. Why didn't you come yesterday? How could l come? Aunt wasn't well. l've to attend to the domestic chores, too. Keep doing the domestic work. You'll never be able to study. Sister, hurry up, mother has called you. - Why, what's the matter? - l don't know. There go your studies. What an escape from trouble. How can l be blamed for this? Where is she? - Aunt, did you call me? - Where were you so long? - l went to study. - l know that. lt's morning time. So much work to be done. How much can l do alone? l don't have ten hands. - What work can l do? - l've asked her to cut vegetables. You go and make tea for your uncle. - Why do you scream at the girls? - l do that? Telling them to work isn't screaming. Your pampering has spoiled these girls. Hey. What are you doing here? Don't you have to study? Here. You have to work a lot at your poor uncle's house, don't you? So what? Everyone works. l'm only doing the same. Please get the door. - Master has called for Mr. Gurcharan. - Alright. - Uncle has called for you. - l'll go right away. - First finish your tea. - No, you cover it and keep. l'll return and finish it. lf l'm late, he'll get angry. l know why he's called me. Brother, did you call me? l was compelled to call you. l thought you were my neighbor. l didn't need to follow up. You'd come on your own. Brother, l'll be obliged if you spare some more days. Haven't l given enough days? lt's been almost a year. Forget the principal. You've not even paid any interest. You're aware of my state. l earn only hundred fifty and have a large family. Enough. What's the point of telling me all this? l just want to know when you'll repay my loan. - l'll repay it very soon. - No. . l don't want to hear any of your excuses. Shekhar's mother isn't well. l've had to send her out of town. That's why l need the money desperately. Repay the loan by next month or you'll be in trouble. Okay, you can go now. - Send Munni upstairs. - Alright, mother. - What is it? - Mother is calling you. Go up. Coming, uncle. This has gotten cold. l'll heat it up. l don't want tea. Just get me a glass of cold water. Here. Father, give me my school fees... or the teacher says my name will be removed. l'll give it to you next week. Next week? Then l won't go to school. Girls tease me saying that my father is poor... and he has no money for the fees. Yes child, we're poor, very poor. - Then father, you... - Go out. At home, outside, wherever l go, l have to keep answering. l don't know what l should do. - Uncle. - This ancestral house was my only support. But this also was mortgaged for your sister's wedding. And now, l had to listen to brother Navin's taunts. Forget it uncle. What's the point of thinking about it? There's no point, but yet, it keeps preying on my mind. She is very beautiful and she's fit for your house only. That's right, l've seen your daughter. But actually, let's talk about the dowry. Don't worry about that. A girl's father is supposed give. You perhaps don't know, but for my niece's wedding... we spent fifty thousand rupees. - Right. - Actually, we really like your son, Shekharnath. And l want to make him my son-in-law at any cost. And the ten thousand you've requested isn't a big sum. - l agree to it. - Actually, l'm not interested in dowry. Whatever you give, will go to your daughter and her husband. - Then is the alliance fixed? - Yes, it is. - Sir. - What is it? - Madam has called you in. - Why, what's the matter? She says, until master sees the girl, don't commit. - Oh. Okay, you go. - Okay, sir. Perhaps, we've done something wrong. - What happened? - The high court inside will decide. You please wait here. Maybe she didn't understand. - What do you mean by that? - What? l've already decided on the dowry and the wedding. You can see the girl as much as you wish on the engagement day. - Besides, the girl has been seen. - Who has seen her? - l've seen her. - But it's your son getting married. So what's the problem? Please give a thought that the times have changed. Unlike our times, partners are no longer chosen by the parents. The boy has to be willing. Do you know how much money they're willing to give? Whatever it is, until Shekhar gives his consent... this marriage won't happen. - ls this the final decision? - Yes. What shall l tell them? Tell them Shekhar will go to see the girl next Sunday. Your father is very upset with me today. That's really bad. He has blood pressure problems. He shouldn't get angry. l know that, but listen to the reason for his anger. - What? - He's arranged your marriage into the Chaudhry family. The girl's father came to fix the engagement date. - No mother, l don't want to marry now. - Why? l've just started working. Let me get established. Listen to him, Lalitha. As long as we're alive, why are you worried about feeding your wife? l've told your father you'll go to see the girl on Sunday. - Why are you quiet? - What can l do? - l'll go if you insist. - Yes son, please go. - Did you hear that, Lalitha? - Yes, l heard it. - Mother is calling you to play cards. - Let's go. Bring me the jar of sugar from the kitchen. Okay, aunty. You go. l'll be right there. - l'm going to Charu's house. - To play cards again? - Aunty has called me. - Okay go, but come back soon. You may go in. Sister is in the next room. Whom are you talking with? Oh, it's Lalitha. Recognize him? He's Charu's uncle, my brother-in-law. He doesn't like Munger and is here on a holiday. We've been waiting a long time for you. Now sit down. Why are you looking in that direction? No, l'm not. Malti, play well or l'll thrash you if you lose. - And if l win? - l'll treat you. Come on, let's start the game. Seventeen, eighteen... - Give me a trump card. - Charu give me the newspaper. l'm playing, uncle. Come here and get it. Why do you want to read? Come here and play with us. What are you thinking? Didn't you want this? Then why hesitate? Come on, go. - Did you call me here to play? - Obviously. Come, join us. - But four of you are playing. - Charu doesn't know the game. You help her. Sit here. There'll be three of them and we'll surely lose. Don't get scared. l'm enough for these two. Come on now, play. Not that one. This card. - Hey. We won. - Yes, l threw that card. Oh. So you've made yourself comfortable here? l'm not playing, l'm just helping her. Soon you'll be playing and Charu will be sitting here. Card games aren't my cup of tea. Oh, Lalitha. Good that you've come. Dress me so the girl will pick me immediately. - You're looking good but... - But what? Your Kashmiri shawl will look good on this shirt. - Then take it out. - You do it yourself. l've come to get the money. l'll be late. l take money whenever l need it, but how will l ever repay it? You are repaying me. Don't you understand? You'll understand one day. - ls your father alright? - Yes, he is. Please come. First, have something sweet. Son, go and bring your sister here. - Why have you laid out a feast? - This is nothing. When my brother's son-in-law came here the first time... we cooked 108 dishes for him. Please eat. Here she is. - Greet him. - No, it's alright. Sit down. Avinash, your father has already approved her. So you can ask her whatever you wish. - Where's the diamond necklace? - What's your name? Tell them your name, child. Very lovingly, my mother chose her name. Because she is fair. - Can you sing? - Very well . Please sing for them. - Son, go get the harmonium. - Okay, father. Shekhar, don't worry. l'll hand her to you laden with gold. You haven't eaten anything. This is a special dish. Try some. Avinash, did you like the girl? Why don't you ask the one getting married? Tell me Shekhar, how is the girl? Mother, their house is like a palace. Huge pillars, marble steps... Kashmiri carpets and priceless ltalian statues. That's all fine but tell me, how did you like the girl? How else can a girl from a good family be? She was nice. Just nice? How was her appearance? How is her complexion? ls she fair like your sister-in-law? Oh. So you think sister-in-law is the most beautiful one? - She's more fair than you. - What's her education? - l forgot to ask that. - You forgot? How could you forget to ask the thing boys ask first these days? What can l do? l forgot. l don't think he liked the girl. l agree. Oh. So today you've got time to tidy up my room? Why aren't you asking how l liked the girl? What's there to ask? She must surely be good. She is. Her house is like a palace. Marble statues and the girl was laden with gold ornaments. - Why are you laughing? - You're making me laugh. Don't laugh. She's not as thin as you who'd get blown by wind. She's quite well built. - Okay, then marry her. - Yes, l will. - Listen to me. - No, l'm very busy. l was waiting for this. Here's my trump card. Girin, from where did you get the trump cards? - l already had them. - Then why didn't you throw it earlier? - l did. - No, you didn't. You men are all cheats. Please think before you speak. l'm a man. - You be quiet. - Okay. - You've cheated. - Why don't you check the previous cards? That l will . Malti, check them. Mother, it's 4 PM. Aren't we going to the theater? - Oh yes. Let's stop the game. - Forget about the theater. The game's going well. We can't. We already bought the tickets. - Where are you going, aunty? - To the theater. - Girin has bought the tickets. - Sister, let's go with them. - How will we get the tickets? - l'll send a man right away. We can't make it. Aunty may get upset. Please come along. lt will be fun if we go together. Yes sister, it will be fun. l'll go and ask mother. Let's get ready. You go and get dressed. You're taking everyone, but why did you forget me? lf everyone goes, who'll guard the house? You mean l'm the watchman? No, l've reserved a seat for you, too. You're smart. Good that you're not married or you'd be like me. Sister, it's 5 PM and you're not ready? l'm ready. Charu, where are my earrings? - You put them in that cupboard. - Oh, right. - Hey. Aren't you ready yet? - l've been ready for a long time. - Let's go. - You'll wear such funny clothes and come along? - Don't you have any brains? - l did, but before marriage. Enough. Get ready soon. - Aunty, we've come. - Oh. Where is Lalitha? l'm taking some money. We're going to the theater. - Everyone is waiting for me. - What? Now you've heard me. We're going to the theater. - With whom? - With Mr. Girin. - Who is Mr. Girin? - Charu's uncle. lt's been couple of days since he came here. He passed his M.A. He's a very nice man. - And he plays cards very well. - Good. You've gathered all the information about him. Looks like you've played cards with him. - Haven't you played a lot recently? - What could l do? Aunty called me and l went there. After getting dressed, you're seeking my permission. Go. Why are you here? Go. - Where's my betel leaf box? - ln your hand. Why not make it a pendant and hang it on your chain? Stop it. l don't like such jokes. Stop fighting. lt's time for us to leave. - We're ready. - But Ms. Lalitha hasn't come yet. Oh, yes. - May l go? - l already said you could. - Let me go just once. - Stop harassing me, Lalitha. Do as you like. You're old enough to think for yourself. Sister, come on. The car is here. - l'm not coming. - Why, what happened? l'm not feeling up to it. You'll carry on. Okay. Take some money. Sister's not feeling well. She's not coming. - What happened to her? - l have no idea. She told me she's not well. Here, she's given this. - Then we shouldn't go. - We shouldn't go because of her? - Ms. Lalitha was quite eager. - What about our own eagerness? Let's go. Listen, l've had a dream... that l become a king Aren't you ashamed to have such dreams? See what lofty dreams he has! Come to me now. l'll cut your nose! Become noseless! What will people say if my nose is missing? Come and unite with me lt's like The Beauty and The Beast She called me a beast Oh beloved, what have you done? The lion had awakened. You put it back to sleep Oh beloved, what have you done? Hey brother-in-law, did you understand that? - Sit down. - Get up. You won't get your nose cut. You won't become noseless You'll make me a queen and you'll become a king Yes, my dear. Yes, my dear. l'll become a king l'll make you the king. l'll make you sit on the throne Have patience Under that throne l'll dig your grave Have patience - ls anyone there? - What is it? Just check who's at the door. Charu's uncle has come. l was talking about him. l've heard a lot about you from the girls. - Greetings. - Greetings. Take a seat. l heard that someone is sick in your house. Sick? No. But yesterday l heard... l must was mistaken. No, you're right. ln a house with children, someone or the other is often sick. The truth is that, poverty itself is a big disease. - Okay, l'll leave. - Why are you going? Sit for awhile. l'm glad to meet you. Nowadays, neighbors don't bother about each other. As long as you're here, do come here whenever you get the time. l'm home after l finish work. l'm much younger to you. Don't be so formal. lt's always like that in the first meeting. Okay, l won't be formal. When did you return from Munger? - 2-3 days back. - Will you have some tea? - You're being formal again. - Okay, l won't be. - Tea? This time? - ls there a time to have tea? Actually, if you agree to have some, then l will, too. Okay, l'll have some. - Sister isn't home, father. - Where'd she go? - To Shekhardada's house. - Then you make some tea for him. What time did you return from the theater? l asked what time you got home? 12 AM, 1 AM? How was the theater? l'm sure you must have enjoyed it. Tell me, l want to hear. Okay, don't tell me about yourself. But tell me, did the one you went with like it? l didn't see it so l'll be happy just hearing about it. l don't know anything. Shekhardada, quickly give me a rupee. Sister's son is waiting. - Sister's boy? - Yes. Don't you know? That old man who sings and begs calls sister mother. And says sister will marry a king. Hurry up, give me the money. l have other work, too. Take it from under the pillow. Listen. - How was the theater that day? - Very good. - What about your sister? - She didn't go. - Didn't go? Why? - l don't know. She came back from your place and said she wasn't feeling well. She said she had a headache and wouldn't go. Hearing that, even Mr. Giren was very upset. Send your sister to me. Take this, and Shekhardada has called you. l won't go. l have too much work. Mother, should l go empty handed? Bless you. May you become a queen. lf you want to practice, go in the next room. But you tell me what should l do? lt's difficult to spend the afternoon. You keep yourself busy all day. Then should l dance? l meant to say that doing nothing, it would be better... to play cards. lf it is so, then go and tell your sister. We'll arrange it immediately. She is very fond of cards. And if she gets a chance to play... she plays very devotedly. - Shall l go? - Go. Listen. Sit. - What is it? - Keep a distance. Don't try to go too close. They are high caste Brahmins. But you're of lower caste. You're an untouchable in their eyes. What nonsense are you talking? Yes, you'll find it nonsense. You're still here? Please go. Stop studying. Let's play cards. No, aunty. l want to study. What will you do, studying so much? After all, you'll play cards in your husband's home. No, aunty will be angry, aunty. l'll convince her. You come. Come on. Put a trump on Giren's Jack. No more trumps. l won't play if you cheat. Keep quiet. l'll play as l like. - This game is ours, uncle. - Pick them up. Play properly, Lalitha. We'll teach them a lesson. But l can't play for too long today. Okay. You've just begun playing. And already you want to go. Here, take your pick. - Annu, what are you taking? - Milk. Sister Charu's cat drank the milk meant for Munni. So l'm going to ask Aunty for some. What's Lalitha doing? She went to play cards at Sister Charu's house. - Who are all playing? - Aunty, Charu and Giren. Listen. Go there and tell Lalitha l'm calling for her. Tell her to come immediately. Here, we won the game. Lalitha, pick up the Jack. - Aunty, l shall leave now. - Go, but play two more games. Hurry up. Why look at my cards? Don't do that again! Sister, Shekharda has called for you. She just sat down, and she's here with a summons. Go away! Aunty, l shall leave now. Finish this game. No. He'll be angry. The game was becoming so interesting. She left. Annu, did he just call me or did he ask anything else, too? He asked me what you were doing. l told him you were playing cards. He asked me who all were playing. l said, sister Lalitha, Aunty, sister Charu and Giren. Why did you need to tell him all that? lt's not my fault. l told him whatever he asked. lndeed. Now l won't give you anything. l heard it at Mr. Gurucharan's place, and today too. Who is this Mr. Shekhar? You know that house with a fence near Mr. Gurucharan's house? - That big house? - Yes. Shekhar is the younger son of that family. Lalitha has been studying from him since childhood. Shekhar has a lot of affection for her. - You were playing cards at their place? - Yes. Even Mr. Giren must surely be playing. - Yes. - You can't be found these days. You've given up studying to play cards? You know l don't like it? l didn't go on my own. Aunty made me go. l don't believe this. Believe it or not, l spoke the truth. l see. So nowadays you've learned to talk too much? You're not a child that anyone can force you. Why not just say you like playing cards in that house? And why wouldn't you? You get good companions to play. Then go, your companions must be waiting for you. Why are you standing? Go. What is it? What happened, Lalitha? Why are you crying? Wish you could understand. Mother, pack your things properly. You have to go to Madhupur for a change of atmosphere. - No, l won't go this time. - Why won't you go? What's the use? l'm alright. And your father isn't in good health nowadays. So l shouldn't go. But he gave the instructions. You must surely go. Yes, mother. lt would be better if you go for some days. Don't worry about father. l'm here to take care of him. - But daughter-in-law... - l won't hear anything. l'll give money to Shekhar to buy the ticket. Alright. l can't argue with you. Do what you like. l'll arrange for your journey. Listen. Like every year, l'll take Lalitha along with me this year, too. - Get a ticket for her, too. - Okay. - Lalitha, tell your uncle. - Okay. Yes. Where's the calendar? Aunt wants to check something. On the table upstairs. Daughter-in-law, tell the accountant... to bring two nice saris for Lalitha. That poor girl doesn't have good clothes. - Uncle. - What is it? The mistress of that house is going to Madhupur for a change. She wants to take me along with her. Go if you want. Tell your aunt. Father, l want to get my daughters married next month. Select an auspicious date from the calendar. - l'll do it after l return. - No, do it right now. The calender belongs to someone else. l have to return it. You won't listen. There's no other day, except on Tuesday. Then l'll have to conduct the marriage this Tuesday. The girl has grown now. l don't want to keep her in the house even for a moment. She's talking like an old woman. Are you going for some important work? No, it's not very important. l'm going to meet someone. lt won't matter if l'm late by a few minutes. Come in. Meet my niece, Lalitha. Yes, l was introduced to her at sister's place. Sit down. l worry for her. - What happened? - Her parents are no more. Until l find a suitable groom for her... l won' find peace. l've told several people. l'm telling you, too. You have many friends. Find a boy who doesn't demand a dowry. He should just like the girl and get married. l say confidently... a decent girl like Lalitha is hard to find. Okay, l will try. Do try, son. Shall l leave? You have to go somewhere, don't you? Yes. Come some other day. l'm sorry to hear about Mr. Gurucharan. That's not the only problem Giren. The ancestor's house was a support. That, too, he mortgaged for the marriage of his elder daughter. Forget the actual amount. He can't even pay the interest. And that old man is waiting for a chance to seize their house. - Who is the old man? - Shekhar's father Navinrai. Disgusting. l mentioned his name early in the morning. What's wrong with the name, sister? Mentioning that unlucky man's name ruins the whole day. Yes, the old man is very cunning. He traded in jaggery and became a millionaire. But he doesn't possess any good qualities. Avinash, did you see Gurucharan's account? - Yes, l saw. - Send someone to find out... if Gurucharan has returned home or not. lf he's back, then call him. But sir, what's the use of unnecessarily calling him? lt's obvious he can't pay off the loan, seeing the condition he's in. l knew he couldn't repay me. That's why l loaned him money in the first place. So that no one else got his house by loaning him money. lt was better for me to give him the money first. l'm planning to demolish that house... and build one for Shekhar. He's our neighbor and we've known him a long time, but what can we do? l'll have to do this, because my money is unavailable. Anyway, forget all this. l'll go inside. You send him in. Okay. You're so busy? You don't come until we call you. - Where is my money? - l've not been able to arrange for it yet. You couldn't? You guaranteed it when you took the loan. You said you'd surely pay back the money within six months. What about those six months? Where is my money? - Why are you quiet? Say something. - l'm trying to. You know my condition. lf you give me some more time... l cannot give even one more day. l notified you two months back that... l had to send money to Avinash's mother. l badly need the money. But during these last two months, you haven't even shown your face. l gave so much extra time because you're my neighbor. But now, my final decision is that... if you don't repay all my money within a week... l'll be forced to auction your house. - But... - No buts. Anyhow, arrange for my money. Yes, you've given him enough time. How can he repay your money. Consider that house of his. Oh God! Why would l ever want that? Gurucharan is an old, poor neighbor. l would never want to auction his house. Now everything will go according to God's wishes. That's right. - The tea is almost ready, uncle. - Greetings. Greetings. Come, sit. Lalitha, Giren, bring two cups of tea. - Okay. - How long have you been back from the office? l just returned. - Sit, child. - Won't you have some tea? - l don't drink tea. No, her Shekhardada doesn't like girls drinking tea. You seem to be troubled. Are you okay? - Why? - No reason. You seem to be lost in thought. No. l am perfectly alright. - Did something at the office... - No, nothing like that. No. You're right. Today, l'm very unhappy. Sometime back, in front of some people of the society... Navin said something, as a result of which... Why wouldn't he? lt's been almost a year since l took the loan. Forget the actual amount, l couldn't even pay any interest. Uncle, forget about all that. Think about it later. How can l? l think about it all the time. The thing is, she doesn't want me to worry. But there's no way to avoid it. Navin has said if l didn't repay within a week... he'll auction this house of my ancestors. lf you don't mind, may l say something? Mind? l don't mind anyone saying anything. - What is it? Tell me. - l have heard from sister... that Mr. Navin asks for high interest rates on his loans. So, l was thinking... l mean, l want... Look, my forefathers have left me lots of money. lt is just lying there. lt's of no use to me. - You repay Mr. Navin. - What? You'll lend me the money? - At what rate of interest? - lnterest? Loaning money is not my business, Mr. Gurucharan. Don't think l'm like Navinrai. l don't consider them human, those who lend money on interest. Whenever you wish, you may repay the money. You'll give me the full amount l owe? Son, it's a lot. lt's Rs. 3000. Rs. 3000? l won't have any problem lending that much. lf my money is of use during your bad times... then it'll be a matter of pleasure for me. Son, l won't ever forget this favor all my life. Don't embarrass me by saying that. During bad times only, one is a help to another. - Mr. Giren is a very kind man. - Yes, you are right. Once when l was standing outside, he gave me lots of chocolates. Quiet Anu. You interfere in everything. Go from here. - What happened then? - He said... he'll give uncle the full amount to repay his loan. - Really? - Yes, he said it in front of me. l'm happy to know that uncle will be able to repay the loan. You've saved me from being ruined. - How can l thank you... - l remembered something. You asked me to look for a boy for Lalitha. l've spoken to some people. They want to see the girl. - When? - Soon. Whenever you say. Call them next week. But l heard she's going to Madhipur. Yes, that is a problem. Then she can't go. This is more important than going to Madhipur. - Yes. - l'll go and stop her right away. - Okay, l'll leave. The judgment shouldn't be hidden from you all. lf he doesn't repay the debt today, l'll seize his house. - Sure. - Don't blame me later... for being unfair to my neighbor. No. You can never be unjust with anyone. You've given him so much time... that not even one's own brother would give. There he is. Why have you made such a long face? So that you could gain my sympathy? Have you brought the money? - l have. - What? - You've brought the money? - Yes. The whole thing? Yes. Count the money. And my documents... Yes. When you have repaid all the money... then your documents will be returned to you. - Accountant. - Yes, sir? Return Gurucharan's documents. Where did you get so much money? Don't ask that. The giver has asked not to reveal his name. Really? Why won't he? lt's not your fault. l'm to blame... that l asked for my money back. Bad times have come. You're right! What are you saying? l've only repaid your money. l can never repay your kindness. lf there's even a little truth in what you're saying... you wouldn't have repaid the debt like a stranger. Tell me, for what interest have you mortgaged the house? No. l haven't mortgaged the house this time. And l didn't have to pay any interest on the loan. What are you saying? You got the money without interest? Who is that generous man? Tell me his name. We'll consider ourselves fortunate hearing his name. Excuse me. l won't say his name. Okay, goodbye. He left. He didn't even give the name. Haughty fellow. l'll see how long this secret remains unrevealed. Who is that ignorant person around here? Why do you worry? Within two days, not only his name... l'll bring all the information about him. Yes, find out. There's surely something fishy. Why do you worry? We're here to obey your orders. - Shall we leave? - Okay. Let's go What are you waiting for? Let's go. Can l have Rs. 10? - Accountant. - Yes, sir? - Give him Rs. 10. - Come, Jugal. - Greetings. Father, the map you had made by the engineer... for Shekhar's house, is ready. - Would you like to see it? - Throw it away! - Now there's no need for it. - Why? Gurucharan has repaid his entire debt. Take this. Shekhar has some expensive clothes. They are so rich, aren't they? Keep quiet. Don't talk too much. Give me the kerchief. Oh, l see all the arrangements have been made. Take this, too. And pack your things, too. You won't have time tomorrow. - Sister won't go this time. - She won't go? Why? Uncle has said that ... What did he say? How will sister tell? She's feeling shy. Her marriage is being discussed. - Marriage being discussed? - Yes. You don't know? Father and Giren are looking for a groom for her. Mr. Giren says, no matter how much money is spent... but the groom should be like a king. Brother Shekhar, Mr. Giren is a very nice man. lsn't he, sister? And did you know? Father repaid uncle's entire debt. Mr. Giren had given the entire amount. Father said, &quot;Now l'm free of worries.&quot; Right? What are you thinking? - Nothing. Get me a 'paan'. - Okay. You didn't tell me all this? Why? Why don't you answer? Alright. You're a stranger to me. l have no claims on you. lt's good you found a kind man to look after you. The way he's trying hard... shows you'll have a suitable groom before long. Remember us on the wedding. You won't be able to do this now. Come and do it later. Whatever you may say, Giren, l liked the boy. Whatever you may say, the boy isn't suitable for Lalitha. Okay, as you wish. Then go to see the other boy. Come, Shekhar. We were discussing Lalitha's marriage. Come, sit. Shekhar, don't you know him? He is a very nice man. He's our neighbor Madhavbabu's brother-in-law Girendranath. - Yes, l've heard of him. - Greetings. - Grretings. - Give it to Mr. Shekhar. - He doesn't drink tea. l went with Giren to see about a groom for Lalitha. The boy will soon graduate. And he's from a good family. But l wonder why Giren didn't like the boy. Why? Why didn't he like him? He's not quite good looking. He says the boy should be good in every aspect. And my opinion is that a man's looks aren't important. The most important thing in a man is his qualities. What's your opinion? - l think Giren is right. - You've won. Uncle, l'm going to Madhupur with mother tomorrow. Please inform me of the marriage. What are you saying? You people mean everything to us. How can the marriage take place before Lalitha's mother arrives? Right, dear? When did she go? Perhaps she left because her marriage was being discussed. Yes, she should. My daughter is more perceptive now. Lalitha is a very nice girl. She'll bring happiness to whichever family she goes. l can say with confidence. When did he leave? Strange boy. l still couldn't understand him. - What happened? - Nothing. l forgot to pack your overcoat. Last time you had a problem in the train because of cold. l had it made as soon as we returned. Wear it if you feel cold. This can never happen. What can never happen? Won't you wear it? That's not it. l was thinking about something else. - Can you say how l'll feel? - Why? Only l know the reason. Before getting married, tell me where you put my things. - Shut up. - Okay. But tell me if you can, how l'll feel? l have several hobbies. But l don't have the capability. Servants can't do my job. Anyway, what will be, will be. You won't come to see. Say whatever you like. Sister, we brought it. Put it there and call Shanti. Let's go. - Are you making a garland? - lt's my daughter's wedding. l see. The wedding is today. Can't you hear? The music is being played at Mr. Ghosh's place. You've made all the arrangements? What arrangements? The girl has grown up now. l have to get her married. ls the garland of these flowers acceptable? Why not? lt is surely accepted... if other flowers aren't available. l've conducted several marriages. l know the customs very well. Oh God! l just forgot. l invited everyone. l just forgot Shekhardada. l'll go and invite him. Or he'll feel very bad. - Sister, make this garland until l return. - Okay. Shekhardada, today is my daughter's wedding. l have come to invite you. How did it happen suddenly? l wasn't informed earlier. How would you? lt was decided only yesterday. Father checked the calendar. - Found there was no other auspicious day. - l see. - What does the groom do? - Boss in the office. Meek at home. How can poor girls of poor people like us get a rich groom? When is the auspicious time? There's no time left. So couldn't arrange for much. We have to manage it by simply exchanging garlands. Annu, listen. - What is Lalitha doing? - She's making garlands. - Tell her to send it to me. - That is for the groom. l'll bring it. Sister, Shekhardada wants a garland. l'm busy. You take it to him. l won't take it. He told you to do it. - Okay, give me one. - Wait. You do the work. l'll take it. lt's better you take it. l have lots of work. - What have you done? - What have l done? Don't you know? Ask Annu what happens by garlanding someone tonight. Oh no. This isn't possible. Lalitha, listen to me. Do it fast. There is lot of work to be done. Dear Lalitha, Shekhar called you. Are you asleep? You go. l'll come. lt's going to be 8 O'clock. You're taking too long. l know. Now there's no time. Charu, bring gifts from mother's room. What is it? - Come inside. - No. Say it from there. What have you done unexpectedly? Same thing again? lt's not my fault. You did it. l have done nothing. Return my garland. That's why l called you. Come in and take it. No. Throw it from there. - You won't get it then. - Forget it. Wait, Lalitha. - l'll complete it. - No. What are you doing? l'm doing the right thing. Exchanging garlands is over. Arrange for the other rituals. - Why did you do it? - Why did you do so? l haven't done anything intentionally. Why did you garland me? l'm not worthy of you. You're getting marriage proposals from good families. l'm poor. Not worthy of you at all. l have no parents. No one at all. - ls this why you're insulting me? - No, Lalitha. You're insulting me. - l'm insulting you? - Yes. Ask your heart. Did you do this because l garlanded you unexpectedly? lt wasn't an accident, but done intentionally. You were so close to me. Perhaps that's why l couldn't know you. Today l realized that l cannot live without you. But your father will be very angry if he hears about this. That doesn't matter now. What had to happen, has happened. And neither of us can change what has happened. Go down and seek mother's blessings. l'm not leaving until tomorrow. Why are touching my feet now? - Just... - l know your aunty talked about your marriage. l pray that you may get a good husband. - What are you hiding? - Nothing. l'm feeling very guilty. You had to go through this because of me. - l want to go away soon. - No dear. Why should you leave? lt's not your fault. lt's not new. Powerful men suppress the weak. l'll leave. That's will be right. You are ill. We will go to Munger for few days. Yes. Take me to Munger. l don't like this place. Okay, l'll make arrangements. The other day what l said rudely at Mr. Navin's place... - l actually meant them. - What is it? That, if you have no objection... l want to get my daughter Lalitha married to you. What are you saying. You are tense right now. Let's discuss it another time. - Will you do me a favor? - What is it? Go to the post office, get the address of Madhupur... from Avinash and mail this. - No. What if uncle breaks my legs? - He won't do that. Please, dear. l'll make a pearl necklace for your doll. Really? l'll do it. - Listen. No one must learn about it. - Okay. Who is it? See who it is. What is it, Annu? l have to get Shekharbabu's address written on this... from Avinash and mail it. - Whom are you talking with? - Annu has brought a letter. What sort of a letter? Bring it here. The letter is from Gurucharan's house. lt needs brother-in-law's address written. You may go. Uncle, are we all going to Munger? Yes, dear. Giren has gone to buy tickets for all of us. l know you are sad to leave this place. But what to do? l cannot stay here. That's right, but l was saying... Why did you stop? Say it. l was saying, what's the hurry? - After a few days... - Got tickets for the day after tomorrow. - You got the tickets? Good. - Here they are. - You keep them. When's the train? - 9 PM. We have to leave by 8 PM. - You are fine, l hope? - l'm fine, brother. - How is your father's health? - He's fine. - Where is Munimji? - Here he comes. l'm taking them. You bring the luggage. Tie this up, too. Sister, Shekhardada has come. - Really? - The way is closed. How will you go to meet him? l'll be back soon. Where're you going? Bring utensils from the kitchen. Wait. Don't close it. l have to unpack my daughter's things, too. You brought it? Keep it. So many things. ls it easy to move so many things to another place? Sister, help me tie the bedding. l can't do it alone. Okay. l'll be right back. - Sister, come right away. - Shekhar, did you meet Lalitha? - No. - l heard they're leaving for Munger today. - What for? For Gurucharan's treatment. Giren owns a house there. l'm going to settle down there. - They're leaving today? - Yes. By the 9 PM train. Daughter-in-law mentioned Giren and Lalitha's marriage. He isn't their caste. l wonder why Gurucharan made this decision suddenly. But the boy is good, educated and rich, too. lt will end Lalitha's problems. - Lalitha, is the tea ready? - l'm bringing it, uncle. You're taking unnecessary trouble. They're packing and you're asking for tea. You don't know Lalitha. She's good at work. Here she is even before l've finished speaking. Give it to Giren. - ls the packing over? - Yes, uncle. l was saying about Munger. What a good climate. You'll be fit within two days. My brother-in-law told me several times. But l refuse to go there with this fear. You don't understand. lf l put on any more weight... l'll have to enlarge the doors of my house. - You all stopped laughing the moment you saw me? - lt's not so. Madhav was talking about the climate of Munger. l returned from Madhupur with mother today. l heard you're leaving. So l came to see you. Thank you. You know these people very well, don't you? l have no words to praise Giren. He helped me when l was sick. Bringing doctor, medicines, taking care of me, everything. He's like a member of the family. How did your mother feel in Madhavpur this time? Good. l'll go now. - What's the hurry? - l have work to do. - How is mother? - Fine. l want to tell you something. The way to your house has been closed. You people are responsible. Mother is calling you. - What is it Aunty? - Where were you? Hurry up and finish your work. Did you go to that house? - No. - Go and seek sister's blessings. And listen, take Anu with you. Anu, what will you say when you meet Shekhardada? What should l say? l'll greet him. No. Before you greet him, say... &quot;Shekhardada, we've come to take your blessings before we leave.&quot; &quot;Knowingly or unknowingly, we have committed many mistakes.&quot; &quot;Please overlook them and forgive us.&quot; - Understand? - l have understood. Shekhar Dada... We've come to seek your blessings before leaving. Take these keys you gave to me. We made many mistakes knowingly or unknowingly. Please forget those and forgive us. Okay, you go home. l'll come shortly. - Come soon. Father has gone to fetch the vehicle. - l know. Why didn't you reply to my letter? - l didn't receive any letter. - You received nothing? But l had... What did you write? l wrote lots of things. You'd have remembered. What do you command now? Command? Of what use is my command? - Why? - Whom can l command? Look, this is no time for fun and games. l'll have to hurry. l beg of you, please tell me what will be the consequence? I’m trembling with fear. What sort of fear? Won't l get scared? There was an argument... between the family members in your absence. That's the reason we're leaving for Munger. What about the money your uncle borrowed from Giren babu? That was a loan and l'll repay it. From where will you get so much money? Don’t you know where a married woman gets her money? l'll get it from there. But from whatever l heard l presume that... your uncle has sold you for the money. What? Whatever you've heard is false. - Hurry up, sister. - My uncle is a gentleman. You don't know his sorrows. Everyone else in this world knows about it. Are you talking of money? He did take money... but only after my marriage. Nor has he any right to sell me. And he hasn't sold me. lf anyone has the right to sell me, that's you. You may repay that loan by selling me, if you like. - Let's go. - Okay. - Hurry up. Lalitha. What are you thinking? Have you forgotten something? Come on. Oh Raadha Radha is leaving... with tears in her eyes Turning her face away from her Krishna... Radha is going Leaving behind her childhood memories Leaving behind Gokul’s verdant paths Parting from the sweet notes of Krishna’s flute Rending a relationship of hearts Turning her face away from her Krishna Radha is leaving with tears in her eyes Turning her face away from her Krishna The day has passed into twilight And look, the fete has ended in Madhuban A lonely Radha... and a lone Krishna Look at the game the Creator plays Leaving behind the light of separation... and turning her face away from her Krishna... Radha is leaving with tears in her eyes Turning her face away from her Krishna Wow. lt's such a beautiful place. - The house is good, too. - How long will we live here? We just got here. What's that noise about? Some boys are playing ball. Has the luggage been delivered? l'll find out. Malti, has the luggage been delivered? Yes. Did you go around the house? So large, so many rooms. - We will share one room. - Take this box in. What's happening here? Why should you take the trouble? Wait. Sitaram! - We're used to it. - Yes, sir. - Where were you? Why didn't you take the luggage in? Take them in. The rooms have been locked for so long. They're very dirty. Ask the servants to clean up the place. Here are your keys. Your aunty may need these keys, so you may keep them with you. - How strange? - What's the matter? l've forgotten my doll's groom. What should l do now? Don't worry, we'll get your doll remarried. What a silly answer that is. Can a woman marry twice? She talks like an old woman. Malti, you hold on to these keys. - Where are my keys? Ramu? - Yes, master. - Did anyone touch the table in my absence? - l did. - l'd put my keys there. - l didn't see them. Did they grow wings and fly away then? You dare not touch my things. Let my room be untidy. Okay. lt's strange. l don't get anything in time. Why did you touch it again? Master, l've found the keys. Perhaps l didn't recognize you, as you were close to me. But l realize that l cannot live without you. God bless you. l heard that your uncle made money by selling you. Why are you standing in darkness, Lalitha? No reason. Listen. - May l ask you something? - Yes. Don't you like this place? Why do you say that? l've noticed you've been sad since you arrived here. You neither speak nor do you go out. Did l hurt you in any way? Please don't embarrass me by thinking that. You have helped us in every way. Writing is your hobby, isn't it? Start writing then? l have lots of spare time. l can help you. l had this hobby only when l was in Calcutta. Why are you in tears, Uncle? You take good care of me. Even my daughters couldn't care for me so well. l'm sure you were my mother in my last birth. l dread the day you'll be married and gone. Don't worry about that, uncle. - l won't marry. - Why do you say that? Uncle, l wanted to tell you something but... What's the matter, child? Tell me. No, not now. You're unwell. lt's time for your medicines. l'll go and get them. - What, mother? - Call the doctor at once. His health is deteriorating. - Haria. Call him immediately. - Okay, madam. Master, madam is calling you. Hurry up. - What's the matter? - Master's unwell, come on. The situation is beyond our control now, Shekhar. lt's a matter of a few seconds. Be brave. There's a letter from sister. ls it from Charu's mother? What's she written? Shekhar's father passed away. What? ls Navin no more? After your quarrel with him, he fell sick and never recovered. He had a heart attack yesterday morning. We had such good relations with that family. l don't understand why this evil had to happen. l'll be blamed for this incident. ls Shekhar's father no more? Yes. l'm responsible for his death. - What are you saying? - That's right. Giren, l'm restless. Help me, son. Please give me a piece of paper. lt's late at night, Lalitha. You may go to bed. l'll sit here. - What's the time? - lt's 4:10 AM. - Where are you, Giren? - By your side. - Lalitha. - Uncle. - You wait outside, child. l want to say something to Giren. - Where is your aunty? - She just left. l'll send her. Giren, come close to me. l know that my end is near. - Please don't say that. - l wanted to get Lalitha... married but couldn't fulfill it. But promise me that you will fulfill my wish after my death. - Please don't hurry. - No, if you don't promise me... l won't be able to die in peace. There's no one to take care of her. l want you to take the responsibility. Tell me son. Promise me. - Tell me. - l promise. - That's enough. l can rest in peace now. You have lightened my burden. l can rest in peace now. - What's the matter? - Listen. - What happened? Listen. Giren has promised to take care of Lalitha. And all of you as well. Call Lalitha at once... so that l can unite them and die in peace. Giren. l will be indebted to you forever. Where is your hand, Giren? Give me your hand. l have little time. l have no regrets. l'm approaching death. - Shekhar? - What is it mother? Mr. Chowdhry has come to fix the date of marriage. Your father had promised him. lt's my wish and Avinash's, too... that you marry that girl. Mother, l've never refused your wishes. But l want you to give me some time to think. l don't want to marry yet. Why? What's the matter? l can't explain now. l'll tell you everything another day. Okay, l'll refuse their offer. Shekhar, Lalitha is getting married. Aunty has sent a letter. l haven't seen my daughter for many days. l wish to go. But how can l go? Anyway, even if l can't go... l must send some jewelry for her. Send someone to call the goldsmith. - Mother. - What is it? You were discussing my marriage, weren't you? Yes, Mr. Choudhary has come. Send him the message that l'll get married. - l can't get married, aunty. - What did you say? ls marriage a simple matter? Before his death, your uncle arranged this marriage. And l've made all the arrangements. Now you're refusing? For what reason? l can't tell you. lf you can't give the reason, you shouldn't even say that. That uncle who used to love you so much, you want to defame him? You want us to be disgraced in front of the relatives? l won't listen to you. You have to get married. Please save me, Mr. Giren. Except for you, no one else can save me. Why? What happened? Tell me, Lalitha. l will consider myself fortunate if l can help you in any way. l don't want to marry. l'm already married. l know l've hurt you a lot by saying this. But believe me. There was no other way besides this. l'm married. You're married? When? Almost 11/2 years have passed. But you never... l've hidden it till today. And if this problem hadn't arisen... l wouldn't have mentioned it even today. Who is your husband? A Hindu woman never mentions her husband's name. Mr. Giren, don't tell this to anyone... until my husband accepts me. This is my only request. Why isn't your husband accepting you? That's not fair. l don't think about that. He's my husband, whether he accepts me or not. We have to stop this wedding somehow. But all the marriage preparations are complete. What should l tell your aunt? Besides that, if l break the promise... given your uncle in his last moments... it will be dishonorable of me. You've put me in a dilemma. l can't say anything right now. Please give me some time to think. No, this can't happen. Never. - Brother-in-law, mother has called for you. - l'm coming. - You called me? - Yes, son. Shekhar's wedding invitation has arrived from Calcutta. - Shekhar's wedding? - Yes. Shekhar's mother has sent this letter. The wedding is next Monday the 29th. She's invited us all. And especially Lalitha has been invited. But this girl is ill. How can l go? And if no one goes, it would be bad. You tell me, what should be done? We should surely go. Then you go to Kolkatta with Lalitha and Malti... by tomorrow morning's train. Alright, l'll make the arrangements. And yes. Listen, son. While in Kolkatta, sell off the house there. Why do you want to sell it? After he dies, what will l do with that house? Sister, you're here? l searched for you everywhere. - Why? - l've brought good news. - What reward will you give me? - What's the news? Shekhar's getting married. Brother-in-law will take you and Malti to Kolkatta. Give me a reward. You're crying? No. Something must've got into my eyes. Welcome, brother-in-law. The new couple has arrived. And you even brought your sister-in-law along? - Why is the music being played? - Don't you know? Shekhar is getting married. Lalitha, you've come on a good occasion. A few days will pass in joy. - Accountant. - Yes, sir? - Did you inform the electricity board? - l'll do it now. Now? l told you to inform them since morning. And you're saying you'll do it now. You can't complete any work entrusted to you. - Go and send someone immediately. - Okay. You all haven't cleaned the flower pots yet? You don't listen if told once. Come on, clean it. Any work given to you is never completed. - Where is mother? - ln her room. You've come for the wedding? l didn't want you to be invited. But l didn't refuse... because the foolishness that took place long ago shouldn't be revealed. - Foolishness? - No? - You proved it. - How did l... - Let it be, Lalitha. l don't want to argue with you on this auspicious day. But why are you in this condition? These torn clothes, glass bangles. l've heard your husband is a very rich man. Doesn't he appreciate a noble girl like you? - No. - Strange. But why? He knows. l don't think about it. That's called a devoted wife. Such devoted wives are very rare these days. Will you say everything? Won't you listen to me? Why should l listen? You yourself ended everything. Welcome. Why are you sad? l've heard your father-in-law... will deck his daughter out in gold. Not only that. His father-in-law is also going to present him... a bank as a gift. Sit down. Enough joking. Greetings. - You? - Pardon me, Mr. Shekhar. Perhaps l'm not worth partaking in this joyous gathering. Even so, l was compelled to come. But l want to have an important talk with you. What is it? Tell me. lf would be better if we spoke in private. They're my friends. Whatever it is, say it in their presence. - A letter? Who's it from? - My mother-in-law. - l mean Gurucharan's wife. - l know that. Please sit. You didn't need to come to me for this. After father, brother manages everything. Meet him. lt would've been better had you told him. No, l can't do anything about that. You tell him yourself. And nowadays you're looking after them. Okay, l'll tell him. But sister said she didn't meet you? - She must be inside. - Sister? Who? - Sister Lalitha. - Who? - Sister Lalitha. Sister Lalitha? Aren't you married to Lalitha? No, l'm married to Malti. But wasn't your marriage fixed with Lalitha? Yes, that's true. But two days before the marriage, sister Lalitha told me... she got married to someone 11/2 years ago. Why are you shocked, Mr. Shekhar? No, it would've been better if you all had left. - l want to talk to him in private. - No problem. Please sit. - Did Lalitha say she's married? - Yes. Hearing this, l was in a dilemma. A Hindu woman marries only once. And before Mr. Gurucharan's death, l had even promised him. After pondering a lot, l married his other daughter Malti... to keep my promise. - Did Lalitha give her husband's name? - No. That noble woman pardoned all her husband's sins... and kept his name a secret till now. But by showing surprise, you've revealed that secret. Mr. Girin, for some time l've misjudged you. l was unaware that someone could quietly make... such a big sacrifice. You sit. l'll be right back. - Hariya? - Yes, sir? - Where is Lalitha? She left some time ago. Give this to daughter-in-law. Shekhar will need this during marriage. This marriage can't take place, mother. What are you saying? You shouldn't talk like that. l haven't said this before now. But it'll be a great sin to keep silent now. What are you saying, Shekhar? - ls this a child's game? - l'm saying it because it isn't. You've pardoned several mistakes of your son. Forgive this mistake too. l'm already married. You're already married? l don't understand anything. l'll be right back. Just wait. - Brother Shekhar. - lt's okay, Malti. - Where's Lalitha? - ln that room. - She's not here. - Then where did she go? Sister. - ls she on the terrace? - l don't know. - You look on the terrace. l'll check the other room. - Okay. She's not there. Will you torment me by keeping silent like usual? Come with me. Mother, she is your younger daughter-in-law. - Who is she? - l told you, mother. You've been her real mother for more than a year. l can't say anything more than that. What are you saying? - She was married to Giren. - No, mother. Giren has married Malti. She is your daughter-in-law. ls this true? But why are you in this condition? l understand. Goddess Parvati has to do great penance to get Lord Shiva. Bless you, child. Let me inform Avinash that the bride has changed. What, mother? We'll see Mr. Choudhary... and cancel Shekhar's wedding. Call off the wedding? But how can this happen now? This has to happen. - Shekhar is already married. - He's already married?. Yes, l'll explain later. Get the car. l'll go myself if necessary.
