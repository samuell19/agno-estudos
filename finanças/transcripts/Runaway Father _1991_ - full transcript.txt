WOMAN: Life isn't fair sometimes. Most of us live with that. But tomorrow, my three daughters and I have a chance to right a wrong that started seventeen years ago. We have a chance to confront face to face the man who changed our lives. A chance to ask him questions that, frankly, we're not sure we want the answers to. My daughter Andrea, she's stronger and doing better than she thinks. I'm worried about Marcia though. Can I call you daddy? Would that be okay? WOMAN: She's young and so sensitive. And Christine, my oldest. She doesn't know it yet. But in the end, I think she might be the one to hold us all together. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] My mother used to say life is like the weather. Sometimes it's sunny and other times it's filled with rain. But when it's windy, things just get blown around. looking back at my life, I realize, my mother was one smart lady.

MIG, six o'clock, take it out. [MIMICS GUNFIRE] -Everybody, for the landing, come on little angel. -[BABY CRYING] How was that for flying? You know one day, you're really gonna fly. Tommy? Fly Andrea too. [ANDREA CRYING] Pick her up. Wanna watch tv with Daddy? Watch movies, come on. [ANDREA CRYING] Want to taste this? [ANDREA CRYING] GRIFFIN: It's good, huh? Honey, honey... Why don't you want to touch Andrea? Why don't you want to touch me? You never touch me. Baby, I love you. I don't know what's happening. All our plans and all our dreams... Your plans, Pat. And your dreams. You were always on me about school and families and having babies. Yeah well, I didn't want any of this. What? All I ever wanted to do, Pat, was to fly a damn plane. And stay the way we were, just the two of us. -Forever. -But we wanted a family. No. No, you wanted a family, Pat. Like I had anything to say about you getting pregnant all the time. My little angel, Christine, she was enough for me. [ANDREA CRYING] Doesn't that ever stop? All day and all night. -I'm sorry. I'll get her. -[CONTINUES CRYING] [ANDREA CONTINUES CRYING] MAN: Come on. PAT: Oh, that wasn't it. Can't wait to get my hands on a double fudge. WOMAN: Sounds good. Christine, honey, sit down. WOMAN: Sit down sweetie. You think I'm fat? I think you're pregnant. I know that. I always am. Now what's that supposed to mean? -You want some money? -No, got it. Is there something else? Where's Tommy? This is Tommy's car, isn't it? Where is he? Kevin, you want a cookie? Pat, what are you doing? Will you stop doing this to yourself? Did you hear the way she said his name? Tommy. Like she knew him. Like she'd been with him. Come on. [DOORBELL RINGS] Must be Vi. Hello. My name is Marjean Stewart. I'm sorry to bother you like this, Mrs. Griffin. But I had to talk to you. Come in. Uh, Pat, why don't I get the kids and get out of here for a little while. [BABY CRYING] WOMAN: It's all right, we're going to go outside. We'll be right outside, Pat. Mrs. Griffin, I, Tommy and I... I'm pregnant. MARJEAN: I thought Tommy... I really thought we'd be together. I didn't know that... You... How far along are you? Two months. But the doctor says, I can still get rid of it. I have no money. I have no place to go. I have no one but Tommy. PAT: How much? What? How much money do you need? I don't know, but Tommy doesn't have any. This isn't coming from Tommy. No. I can't take your money. Do you want to have his baby? I don't know. Well, you think about it. And let me know. Mrs. Griffin... I'm sorry [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CRYING] Hi, Honey. What're you still doing up? Waiting for you. Okay, well, I'm here. What a day. I had a visitor today. Oh, who's that? A girl by the name of Marjean Stewart. Who says she's pregnant, with your baby. And you believed her? Yes, I did. Did she ask you for any money? No. But I was going to offer. Oh, Patsy. Sweetheart, that's the oldest scam in the book. It used to happen to us on the base all the time. I mean, these young girls would scout out he married men and then they'd go to their wives, and give them a story about how lonely and pregnant and how broke they were. And by the time the husband got home, that girl was long gone. -With about five hundred dollars of cash. -But she knew your car. I took the kids for ice cream, and she... -GRIFFIN: Where? Bunny burgers? -Um-hmm. Well, sweetheart, I take the girls there all the time. And that's where she probably saw me. It's not true? No. No, sweetheart. It's not true. You're my girl. I love you. Shy, innocent, little Patsy. Ah, too long. [TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, honey. Look at your nose. Here you go. Go play on the slides now. Be careful, though. Don't get hurt, Kevin. Hey Pat... Pat, what's the matter? What is this? I found them in... From his jacket. What are you going to do? I don't know what to do. Help me. Tell me what to do. Well, talk to him, Confront him with it. I can't. Why? I'm afraid he might leave. If he leaves I don't know what I'd do. Pat, stop that. Listen, you're holding on to something that doesn't exist. This man isn't yours anymore. Why should he be? Look at me. [GASPS] I'm a mess. Honey... Maybe if I... If I fixed up a little, you know, put some makeup on and fixed my hair. -Made really nice dinner. -Pat stop. Stop it. Pat, romance and makeup are not going to fix this. You're not the problem, Pat. He is. Aww. [CLOCK TICKING] [DOOR OPENS] Where have you been? Don't you never ever ask me where I've been. You understand me? -You do not have the right to... -I am your wife. -I have the right... -You have the right to nothing! Because you do not own me, Pat. I guess not. Not judging from these... I found them in your jacket. We are barely getting by, and you spend our money like that! Tommy. Tommy. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] -Hi! -Hi. It's kind of hard. Um... Could I borrow some cereal, and maybe some milk -from you? -Of course. Come on in. No, no. I just haven't been able to get to the store. Why? What's the matter? Tommy went out for some cereal, and he hasn't been home for a couple of days. -[PATSY SIGHS] -Don't you say another word. Tommy... PATSY: Tommy! [BABY CRYING] -Hi, angel. -Tommy, Tommy, honey. Talk to me. Tommy, just talk to me. [BABY CRYING] Tommy, please don't. Don't do this. Don't... Don't leave us. Tommy. I'm sorry. I'll... I'll do anything you want me to do. I'll be anything you want me to be. Just don't do this. Don't leave. Please don't. Tommy, just don't leave us. Please, honey, don't do it. I... Honey, don't. Tommy! Tommy, no! No! No! [GASPING] -No! You can't leave us! -[BABY CRYING] [PATSY SOBBING] [ANDREA CRYING] [ANDREA KEEPS CRYING] -Please get up, mommy. -Oh. [DOORBELL CHIMING] Hi, Pat. Where's Tommy? Tommy? I haven't seen him. His car's right there in the driveway, Bill. I know he's here. I want to talk to him. It's okay, Bill. What's the problem, Pat? Hi angel. Hi, daddy. What do you want? I want you to come home. Already been there. Tommy, for God's sake. I don't have any money. I don't even have any food... -Pat, I will help you out when I get back on my feet, okay? -What about the baby? And Christine, she adores you. You're just gonna run out on her? -Want some ice cream, honey? -Where are you going? -Taking them away from you, Pat. -What? You think I want her to grow up to be like you, huh? Get in the car, doll. I'll get some ice cream. Come on. -Tommy. -I'm taking her away from you. -I'm gonna get custody, and you ain't never gonna see her again! -Stop it! Stop this. [CHILD CRYING] Christine, open the door honey. Sweetheart, open the door. Honey, open the door! Tommy. Stop it! Stop it! [CAR SCREECHING] [CAR SCREECHING] What are you gonna do? I'm gonna call the police! [CAR SCREECHING] -We just went for a little ride. -PATSY: A little ride? This time. PATSY: Give her to me! Gimme her! Christine! Give her to me. [GASPING] Tommy! Don't you ever do that again! Ever! [SOBBING] Oh. God. Oh. How are we gonna live? Don't worry about it, Pat. Look, your folks will help out, until I can kick in. Pat, you're not going to starve. Daddy loves you, honey. Hey, Bill! Oh! [GASPING] [BABY CRYING] Yes. My baby. My baby. [PATSY CHUCKLES] [BABY CRYING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Pat? Tommy. What was it? It's a girl. Another one? Did you name her? You picked the other girls' names. Do you wanna name her? Why don't you just err, pick one out of the phone book. [SIGHS WEARILY] Why are you here? -See what you had. -We had, Tommy. We had. Did you know we're on welfare? Did you hear me? Your children and I, are on welfare. How does that make you feel? Where's Christine? She and Andrea, are with my folks. Well... I guess that's it then. There she is. [VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM] Attention. Visiting hours will be over in 15 minutes. Oh, my God. Sweetheart. Hi, baby. How you doing huh? Ah, good. Patsy... Look, hon. Uh... What do you say we take a little walk, okay? -You want to see her? -Of course. Yes, yes. She looks just like Christine when she was born. -You remember? -Yeah. [OVER PA SYSTEM] Doctor Bartman, please report to Radiology. Doctor Bartman... Honey, I want you to sit over here. Oh, I'd be happy to. Careful. -You all right? -Yeah. Uh, Tommy's gone. He took everything. What? He emptied out your bank account. He defaulted on the car loan, and they repossessed it. -He even had the phone disconnected. -[PATSY GASPS] -There's nothing left. -Oh, God. Oh, God, This can't be happening. [SHUDDERS] How could he do that to us? Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. [GASPING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [BABIES CRYING] [SERENE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] That's my sister. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I keep telling you, Patsy, it won't be so bad. -You'll get a job, you'll see. -What kind of job? Well, maybe you could work in the drugstore, in Harry's drugstore A couple of hours every day. Mom, I keep telling you. I can't get a part time job. If I do that, I lose my welfare benefits, and I make more on welfare, than I would on a job like that. I'm just stuck. Now, don't talk like that. It's just a temporary thing. And there's no shame in taking a little help, now and then. I just wish your dad and I could help -some more. -I know, ma. I just expected more from my life. I'm not prepared for this. I don't know how to do anything. I'm... I've no training. I... My life has come to a big dead end, all of a sudden. I just wish... Wish I could go back to school. To school? You've got two years of junior college. Isn't that enough? No. I need to go back for another two years and get a degree. Maybe then I could get a decent job, and I could support my kids. You really want this, don't you? Yeah, I do. I really, really do. I don't know... I mean, I don't even know if they'll let me go to school on welfare. Besides, what would I do with the kids? Honey, what are grandmothers for? Would you take care of them sometimes? Of course I would. You're still my baby. Ma, I'm so scared. I know, sweetheart. I know. Look, the Welfare Department has never supported the idea of a recipient going to college. Why not? What's wrong with wanting to do something with my life? If you go back to school, we have no way of knowing where your money's going. The only chance that I have, of getting off of welfare, is to go back to school. Look, I'm... I'm not getting child support. I don't think I ever will. [SIGHS] My husband hasn't paid me a dime. I don't even know where he is. I don't know. Why don't you make me a test case? Nobody's ever asked this before. Please. I just want to be able to take care of myself and my family. Doesn't that count for anything? I don't think my supervisor would approve this. Ask. Just ask. Okay? I'll think about it. Thank you. [SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Good one. -Whoop! -Pat! Pat! Jerry, wait. PATSY: Jerry! [EXCLAIMS] -Open it. -I can't! I can't! [EXCLAIMING IN JOY] And the winner is... PATSY: I can't believe it's straight A's!

Now, the coffee boy is the most important person to know, of course. and you'll get your manuals later on this afternoon. Let me introduce you to Grace. -Hi. -Bob, Julie. -This is Pat. -Hi. -Hi, Pat. -Any questions? I don't think so. Now, you'll start here, and you'll work your way, all the way down there to the end. -To an office? -Hard work. Dedication. It's yours if you want it. Welcome aboard. Thanks, Ruth. -But let me know if you need anything. -I will. Good luck, Pat. [FAIRGROUND MUSIC PLAYING] Ooh! Hey! There they are. -Thank you. -Christine is having a ball. -Did you see who's here? Eddie's Lin and Uncle Crankwood -I was so surprised. -Do you have some cake? -It was wonderful. Oh, good. -Hi, Lorraine! -Pat, free cake. Where'd you get it? -I made it. -Come on. Who taught her everything she knew? [EXCITED CHATTERING] -Looks good. -Yes. LORRAINE: Oh, it's terrific. I love it. So good to see you laughing again. Yeah, we're still broke, but it's a start. [GATE OPENING] There's Bill. What's he doing here? Hi, Bill. -Pat, I'm sorry to interrupt your party like this... -Well, what is it? It's about Tommy. What about him? He came back, didn't he? Bill, did he? Is he back? No, Pat. Tommy's dead. How did it happen? Tommy's foster mother called me this morning. -He was killed in a plane crash. -Oh, my God. [SOBBING] Where? I don't know exactly. A friend of Tommy's in Atlanta, phoned the Griffins. Are they sending him back here? They haven't found the body. -Oh. -[CHRISTINE CRIES] It's all right, honey. -[CRIES] -Sshhh. [CRIES BITTERLY] Oh, there you are. Girl, I was looking for you. Your exemption case is here. Divorced mother. She's got proof she was the sole support of the child. Okay, great. I'll be with her as soon as I can. [CHUCKLES] Girl, it's been like that all day. Hello? LADY OVER THE PHONE: Mrs. Thomas Griffin, please. -This is she. -This is Blanche Payton. I got your name and number from my husband's sister. I need to speak with you. It's about your ex-husband. What do you want? I... Look, I don't have to say this, but I think... that the man I married seven months ago is your husband. My husband is dead. He died in a plane crash more than three years ago. I don't think he's dead. His sister's name is Carol. She told me how to find you. Where are you? I'm at a pay phone at a restaurant called Birdie's. -On Fourth? -Yes. I'll be right there. Mrs. Griffin. Bennett, it's Pat Bennett. -Bennett? -My maiden name. I met him a year ago. He told me his name was John Douglas Payton. My husband's name was Griffin. Thomas Griffin. He lied to me. We were only married a short time. And then two weeks ago, he walked out on me. Without a word, he just... He just left and he didn't come back. Do you have a picture of him? No, I'm sorry. Well, how do I know you're telling me the truth? How do I know this isn't some kind of... scam to get money from me? He's all I had. Oh, I was so... I was so crazy in love with him. He'd hold me and he'd tell me stories about how... All he wanted was to fly. And be with me. Just him and me. That's all he wanted. And I would've done anything. I would have been anything he wanted me to be. How did you find me? I looked through his things and I found his sister's phone number in Miami. She told me that, that he'd been married to you. And we thought that when he ran out on me, that he might have come back to you. So I was hoping that, I'd find him here, with you. You never divorced? We thought he was dead. Wait, you have, you have children? Three. You have any pictures? He told me he didn't want any. Not with me. That son of a bitch. For three years... I have lived in the mourning thinking he was dead. Thinking I would never have a chance to see him again. Never have a chance to confront him with any of this. Now, I find out he's alive, but my girls still don't have their father. What kind of man does this to his family? Well, you know what I think of him? Are you going to tell the girls? No, I am not going to tell them. You're going to let them think that he's still dead. Lorraine, I don't want them hurt again. All these years, he has manipulated me. Every time I cry, I thought my heart would break, he won. Every time my girls were alone and hungry, he won. I am not gonna let him win anymore. I am going to take back my life. Why me? Why me? I don't need this in my life. This is disgusting. -It's... Woah! -[CHUCKLES] What are you doing? It's my Saturday. I really don't want to be here. Take the rake, and rake it and put it in the bag. CHRISTINE: Mother! Mom, Lorraine is on the phone. Christine! Lorraine, I'll call you back. She'll call you back. Christine, the phone is not gonna reach. Think a little bit. [CAR HONKS] PAT: Come on, just keep raking all right. Bye, mom. See ya later. Where are you going? -She's going with Tony. -Tony? Tony. You know... [LAUGHS LOFTILY] Mom, do I wash this in whites or darks? Because this isn't dark. No, honey. Not white. Not dark. They're colors. That pink goes with the colors. Okay, I'll do it. Okay, bye, honey. See ya later. [BELL RINGING] [TYPING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. WOMAN ON PHONE: Mrs. Bennett? -Yes, this is Miss Bennett. -About your daughter Marcia. Yes? This is Miss Campbell at her school. Marcia has been truant for three straight days. And it's not the first time. I think you'd better come over here. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Well, why haven't I heard about this before? Why haven't you called me? If you look through her file, you'll find... dozens of written excuses forged in your name. Oh, she wouldn't do that. But she did. That's her pattern. What are you saying? I'm saying Marcia needs help. What kind of help? We have a program for kids like Marcia who need more attention. I recommend that we transfer her to a special class, but I need your approval. [DOOR OPENS] Just, what in the hell is going on here? Have you ever wondered why Marcia ditches school? Why Christine never goes out? Or why Andrea can't even keep a boyfriend for more than a few weeks. -Christine! -Tell her. Yes, tell me. Well, I guess I feel like I'm not good enough to like him, and then I just suffocate whoever it is I'm with. And then, what? They leave. Honey. You don't have to do that to keep a boy. I know, but, I just get so panicky. CHRISTINE: Have you ever read any of Marcia's poetry? Poetry? She writes about pain and wishing she was never born. Oh, honey. Marcia. Is that true? Oh, honey. I've always tried to be there for you girls. I think we needed a father, too. You never let anyone get close enough to take his place. Dad really messed us up, Mom. I never even knew you thought about him. CHRISTINE: Yeah. Yeah, it's like this family should come with its own warning label. "No men allowed." MBA and promotion. How does it feel? Good. -Feels good. -Uh oh. What's going on with you? It's my kids. Marcia is in all kinds of trouble at school, and I never even knew about it. And Andrea... I don't think I ever really realized the effect not having a father has had on them. You've done your best, honey. Kids get into trouble. Even in the best of families. It happens. On top of everything else, I get a letter rejecting my request for Tommy's social security death benefits for the girls. They say, I can't collect, even though nobody has heard from him -for more than ten years. -But why not? I thought the state of Virginia declared him legally dead. They did. Doesn't mean anything. Just makes his disappearance legal. He's out there, Ruth. He is out there. I'm gonna try and find him. I'm gonna make him answer to those girls. They're entitled to that. They're entitled to child support. After all he's done, that is the least he could give them. Take it easy, girlfriend. Now, you deserve a break. Why don't we celebrate your promotion? I've been given two tickets to Congressman Henderson's fundraiser, this Saturday. -We're going. -Ruth, I don't... Every eligible man on Capitol Hill will be there. It'll be fun. You owe it to yourself. Saturday. [PLAYING HARP] Some nice-looking men here, don't you think? -Ruth, stop! -I just want you to be happy. -Please. -Mingle. Talk to people. Why don't you talk to that nice, young man over there? Good to see you again. Oh. Did you want one? One was all there was. And I got it. I'm sorry. [MUNCHING] Um, Richard. Pat. Can I buy you a drink? Sure. It's a nice party, isn't it? I work for the IRS. I want to say that right up front. It usually scares people. -See ya. -[LAUGHS] Wait a minute. What do you do? Who, me? Um, I'm an investigator. Really? An investigator? What kind? Private. -Really? -Really. Why? You have something for me? -Maybe. -For the IRS? No. No. Me. -Ugh, stop it, Pat! -What? I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this tonight. Come on. Come on. What do you have? No. Uh. What could you possibly have? Except a pair of very beautiful eyes? You had to ask, didn't you? Well... An ex-husband that I'm trying to track down. [SIGHING] Not another one. How far have you got? Well, through his former wife I tracked him to San Antonio, but then I ran into a dead end. He's not there anymore. Do you know where he worked? I think he was an insurance adjuster for a company called Transworld Fidelity. They have one in San Antonio? Yeah, that's what I called but he transferred out. Call the main office. What if he doesn't even work for that company anymore? Well, he still got to be licensed. Each state has only one licensing office. Fifty offices, fifty calls. Better than going through ten thousand city telephone books. What if I hired you? [CHUCKLES] Ooh! Then we'd have to see each other again. Look, you don't have to hire me. You could do this yourself. -But I'll tell you what. -What? Here's my card. If you need me, you give me a call. Okay? Thanks. Okay, Tommy, where are you? Yes, he disappeared ten years ago. At that time, he was working for you in San Antonio. Can you help me? MAN ON PHONE: Privacy laws are very strict. All I could do is confirm or deny. Look, he's my ex-husband. Actually, he's disappeared twice. He left me alone with three kids. What's his name? Then it was John Douglas Payton. Do you have a file on him? Anything? We have a file for a John D. Payton. Do you have his Social Security number? -No, I don't. -Describe him to me. Uh, six-one. Brown hair, blue eyes, about a hundred eighty pounds. ANDREA: Mom? Mom, I need five dollars to go to the movie. -Who are you talking to? -Nobody that you know. My purse is on the table, in the kitchen. -I'm going to stop at Judith's later. -What? I'm going to Judith's later. Can you hold on one second, please? You call me when you get there. -Mom! -You know the rules. Go on. Did he leave a forwarding address? I can't tell you that. Well, can you give me a Social Security number? I'm sorry, I can't help. [PHONE DISCONNECTS] WOMAN: Florida State Licensing Department. Yes, I'm looking for an insurance adjuster by the name of John Douglas Payton. John Payton. I'll have to look him up, Can you hold on a moment? Yeah. Yes, we show a John D. Payton insurance adjuster in Tampa at 4682 Ayrshire Drive. You have a John Payton in Tampa? Isn't that who you wanted? Yes. Yes, it is. Hold on one second. Give me that address again. Uh, that's 4682 Ayrshire Drive. Thank you. Thank you very much. Whoo! I've gotta go out. You finish dinner. What? Me? -I'll be back. -Why is it always me? -Help your sister. -Cook, Marcia. -Clear, Marcia. Make dinner, Marcia. -Okay. -Help your sister. -What do you-- What are you making anyway? Bread! Mr. Frowming. Mr. Frowming. Richard. -Pat, what are you doing here? -Hi. Your secretary told me you just left. Guess what? I found him. -Great. -I actually found him. My ex-husband Tommy in Tampa, Florida. -That was after four days and 32 phone calls. -Very good. Now I just have to find out if this John Payton which is the name he's going under, really is Tommy. So I want to hire you. I do. I want you to go down there and follow him to a restaurant and get his fingerprints. And what would I do with these fingerprints? Well, take them to the FBI, so they can track him down. Sure, then I'll call you on my secret decoder ring with the results, right? I think you've been watching too many detective movies, Pat. I think I have. Look, I really do have to find out if it's him. Look, slow down a bit. What I can do is I go down there, get some photos of him. if it's Tommy, you'll know soon enough. Okay. Great. Hey, you want have some dinner or something? I can't. The girls have dinner waiting at home for me. But I need some more information about Tommy in Tampa I mean. Oh, right. Well, listen. Why don't you come home with me and have dinner and we'll talk about it? Okay. -But just business talk? Absolutely. -Yes. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Richard back already? Good luck. MARCA: I'll get it, mom. -Hi. -Hi. -Mom, it's Richard. -Thank you. Thanks, honey. Excuse me. Here. [EXHALES] That's him. Changed? A lot. But you're sure it's Tommy? Yeah. That's him. You're not gonna get him back here. Grant won't sign extradition orders for cases like this. Grant? He's the Common Wealth attorney for the state of Virginia. Well, what should I do. You're gonna have to hire an attorney in Florida. And from everything I know about cases like these, it could take a year. A year? God, not another year. I know some people down there. I can't afford an attorney. I don't have that kind of money. RICHARD: Don't worry. I can make some calls. We can get you somebody good. Thanks. Will you take these? Yeah. I better tell the girls. I don't know how they're gonna take this. I don't know... what they're gonna do. Call you tomorrow? Richard... Thank you. Okay. Are you sure that it's daddy? I mean, Thomas Griffin. Actually, years ago, I found out there was a chance that he was still alive. What? Why didn't you say anything? Because I was afraid it might be a blind alley and... I didn't think it was worth upsetting our lives. Well, don't you think that was up to us? Yes, but you were all so young. So what are we gonna do now? I'm gonna go to Tampa. For what? Now that I have proof that he is actually alive, I'm gonna try and go after him for the back child support he owes us. Girls, It's enough for you all to go to college and then some. So I'm gonna go down there and I'm gonna file a petition. Can we go with you? PAT: What? -Can we go too? -Oh, no. We have a right to see him. MARCA: I don't want to see him. He's never seen me. He doesn't know who I am. I don't want him to know how I feel. -It's none of his business -Marcia? What if he sees me and he doesn't want me all over again? What if he still doesn't love me? What will I do? Marcia? I know how you feel You don't, how could you? Because he was my father too He abandoned me just like he did you. At least he stuck around while you were born. So? He was never there for me. He was never there for any of us. But I still want to meet him. I want him to know who I am. [SOBBING] Come on, Marcia, I wouldn't want to go without you. Come on, Marcia. Girls. Girls, look I don't know what's gonna happen when I get down there. I don't know how he's gonna react. I don't want you guys to get hurt. Mom, we have a right to make this decision. [SIGHS] Okay. I've always want to ask him why he left us. I know, so have I. Me too... me too. [AEROPLANE LANDING] Check this out. Wow. -Pat? Yeah. -You must be Frank. -This is my daughter Andrea. -Hi, Andrea. There you are pay the driver. That's my daughter Christine. Hi, Christine, here let me help you with that. -That's Marcia. -Hi, Marcia. Hi, nice to meet you. If I knew the girls were coming, I'd have gotten another room. That's all right, We'll put in a cot or a pillow. Doesn't matter. I don't think we're going to sleep much any way you know. Where is the beach? Where do you think? Out there. -Come on, let's get you checked in. -All right. CHRISTINA: Here's your soda. -PAT: Diet? -FRANK: Which one's the diet, that one? Thank you. -See you later -Thanks, guys. -Take care. Bye. -Okay, girls. We will. If we simply file a petition here in Florida to accept Virginia's decree of forty two thousand dollars in back child support, Tommy will be notified. That means he can run again. He could, but even if he didn't, this will never get to court. Then his daughters would never get to meet him. We could ask the court for a writ of ne exeat. Ne exeat, what's that? This would allow the sheriff to arrest Tommy without notice. Hold him until he can post bond. It's rare. Judges hate to deal with it... but we could get lucky. What if we don't get lucky? What's the least you want to get out of all of this? Five thousand dollars. That would cover my expenses so far. But the most important thing is I want him to promise that he'll meet his girls face to face so that they can talk to him. I'll do the best I can. [INHALES DEEPLY] [LAUGHING] Don't splash me. I'm so wet. So what are you going to say to Thomas Griffin when we see him? I'm gonna ask him why he didn't love us enough to stay around. I think he did love us, I remember... What do you remember? Come on, Chris, you're older. You had more of him then we did. He'd be sitting on the couch and I'd run to him and open my arms and he would grab me and hold me. He'd let me sip his beer and then he'd pick me up and fly me so high, and so fast, he'd call me his flying angel. I'd just go, daddy, daddy. [LAUGHS] Daddy. So, what are you gonna say? I sorta wrote a poem. What is it? Let's hear it Can I call you Daddy? Would that be okay? I dream of loving moments when I know just want to say. When I don't feel sad or guilty for being here today. Would you and Mommy still be happy, and as one, if had never been born... if I could be undone. Can I call you Daddy? Forgive me if I pray. Just to have you hold me. If only for one day. It's okay. It's okay. Richard. What are you doing here? RICHARD: Ah, well, I was in the neighborhood. -Hey, Frank. -Richie, long time no see. Yeah. I thought I'd keep an eye on Tommy until you got all the paper worked out He's got a nasty history of running. So... It'd be a shame if he got wind of this and skipped. Hey. Thank you. It's okay. You got this far, right. Well, I'm going to go out to Tommy's and make sure he stays until the sheriff gets there. -Do it, Frank. Yeah. -Good luck, Richard. FRANK: Your Honor, we ask the court for a writ of ne exeat. I order that John Payton be arrested. Ordered he stay in Florida to attend a child support hearing. Is there any reason why a bond should be more than one thousand dollars? Your Honor, if the court sets the bond to low, Thomas Griffin, alias John Peyton may pay on the spot and flee. Then ten thousand. And good luck, young lady. Thank you, Your Honor [TELEPHONE RINGING] Officer? What can I do for you? Let's see what do we got here? Pick up a deadbeat dad over in Luths. He lives at 4682 Ayrshire drive. Well, that part of Lutes isn't in Hillsborough County. That's over in Pasco County. That's out of our jurisdiction. What do you mean? What do we do? You have to go see the Pasco County Sheriff, Jim Marsee. That's twenty five miles from here. Well, you better hurry. His office closes at five. We'll never make it in traffic. [TIRES SCREECH] Sherriff Marsee! -OFFICER: That's him -Sherriff, wait, wait!! Here. [PANTING] [CHATTER OVER WALKIE] Where are they? Maybe they couldn't find him. Maybe he wasn't home. Pat... Relax. Come on. Everything's on schedule. Sit down [SIGHS] I'm not sure I really I want to see him right now. I'm not sure I'm ready. I'm gonna go call the girls. [DOOR OPENS] You bitch! You okay? Keep it together. It's okay. Where is he? Did he get here yet? We didn't miss him, did we? He's here. [DOOR UNLOCKING] Your daughters are outside. They're asking for you. Would you like to see 'em? [MUMBLES] Well, he won't see you and I'm sorry. Please, They just want to talk to him. He's got his rights and he says no. Can you at least give him some pictures? I brought my scrapbook for him to see. I guess I can give him some pictures. This too, please. Okay. Mom, I'm scared. -I know. -I don't want to see him. It's all right. JOHN: My lawyer here yet? Your kids sent these to you. [CALM MUSIC PLAYING] -I just talked to Frank. -What'd he say? One back payment of $5,000 and $200 a month until Marcia turns 18. Will he see us? No. So I told him no deal. He must really hate us. Honey... Hey, sweetie. Marcia, come here. Honey, I don't think he's capable of hate any more than I think he's capable of love. So he abandons us? -It's no excuse. -Of course, it's no excuse. There is no excuse for what he's done. I just think there's something missing from him. He sounds so sad. I know. You know, we gotta remember something here. There's nothing wrong with us. It's him. Okay? -Okay. -[CHUCKLES] We lost. What? Judge Evans vacated the writ. Tommy is free to go. Why? The writ was issued in Hillsborough County. Served in Pasco County. Gave the judge an out. He didn't have to deal with the real question. So, we can't see him today? He's already left the courtroom. I'm sorry, Pat. What we can do is file an appeal in Pasco County right away. Please don't get discouraged. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] PAT: But, Frank, I don't understand. Now, what's the problem? The problem is, Pat, Judge Kalis is known for letting these guys go. He's not sure he can enforce this as a debt. -They're treating it as a loan -It's not a loan. I know that. Pat. Look, he's not sure this is a matter for the civil court. Now we've got five days to file the briefs. That's ridiculous! -Mom? -What? Thomas Griffin just called. He wants to see Christine, Marcia and me. [AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING] Let's split up and see if we can find him. Come on over here. Let me have a look at you. Come on, sit down. I'm Andrea and Marcia. Um Christine couldn't make it. She's sick in the motel. We, have to talk. You look just like your mom. Did you love her? Yes, I did. ANDREA: So why did you leave her? Why did you leave us? -These things happen. -These things happen? You just walk out on your wife and your three children, that's all? I didn't ask you here to discuss this. I asked you here to make a deal. A deal? What kind of deal? If we can settle this out of court... I'll make it worth your while. I'll see you through school. I'll buy your clothes. I'll put money in your pockets. Just like a father You tell your mother... that if she doesn't stop harassing me, she's not going to see one dime. Now, you tell her that! This whole thing is beat. -Let's get out of here. -That's it? Would you have anything else you want to say to me? Yeah. How about goodbye. [SLAMS] [AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING] [MARCIA CRYING] [BOTH CRYING] RICHARD: Here you go. Thanks. [SIGHS] So what now? File the appeal, and wait. Why isn't Frank filing? He's done everything he can, and I can't ask him to keep working for nothing. -Where will you file? -Here in Tampa again. And if I win the appeal, I'll have to argue my own case in front of the court. Okay, Perry Mason. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] One person at a time. REPORTER: Are you arguing your own case ma'am? No more questions, please. BAILIFF: All rise. Court in the state of Florida, County of Pasco is now in session. The honorable Michael Curtis presiding. We're here to determine the ability of John Payton to pay child support. Let's proceed. Your Honor, I would like to call John Payton to the stand, please. BAILIFF: Please raise your right hand. You do solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in the cause now pending before this court is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Please state your full name For the record. -John Douglas Payton. -Please be seated. Mr. Payton... isn't it true that after your arrest last year, you transferred your share of co-owned property, cash certificates of deposit and ownership in a duplex apartment? That all belongs to my wife and her family. Didn't you spend more than $20,000 in home improvements last year, including the purchase of a wide screen TV at a cost of $3200? I object, Your Honor. Really, a television set? I am trying to show that he has been hiding cash all along. Answer the question, Mr. Payton. The truth is, Your Honor, I'm stone broke and deeply in debt. I don't even have a bank account. Right after Tommy's... Right after Mr Payton's arrest, he and his wife closed their money market account of fourteen thousand dollars. And we have canceled checks from his employers for more than $ 30,000. LAWYER: Now we're getting a lesson in accounting. Your Honor, I must object. Please move it along, Ms. Bennett. Yes, Your Honor. One last question. You met your daughters, Andrea and Marcia for the very first time just recently, is that correct? No, that is not correct. Excuse me. For the first time since Andrea was a baby. I don't believe you ever didn't meet your daughter Marcia. Whatever. Do you know who this young woman is? [AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING] No, I don't. PAT: That's very sad. That's your daughter. That's Christine. You don't even know who your own daughter is. PAT: Your honor, this man has not seen his children for 17 years. He has changed his identity. He has committed bigamy and he has failed to support his children. He has showered himself with luxuries while his children were forced to live on welfare. LAWYER: Your Honor... Your Honor, if a man were brought before you who had abused and beaten his children, this court would have no problem in condemning him. While my children may look... perfectly healthy on the outside, but on the inside... they are bruised and scarred for life. And there is no amount of money that is ever going to make up for the emotional damage that has been done to them by not having a father all these years. This pattern of allowing men to simply run away from their responsibility as fathers has got to stop. And it could stop right here and right now, if you find this one father in contempt for failure to pay child support. Show these people that the system really does work. I want my girls to be able to walk away from here with some sense of dignity and some hope for the future. Please, Your Honor. Please. Hearing the testimony, the court will take a short recess. You'll have my decision in one hour. [KNOCK] BAILIFF: All rise. Having heard the testimony, the court finds John Douglas Payton's failure to make payments of back child support, willful and premeditated. Mr Payton, in addition to making payments of back child support in the amount of $ 106,500, you are remanded into the custody of the Pasco County Jail for a period of not less than thirty days. Relax, you're not gonna do any time. JUDGE: In addition, you'll be forced to pay back interest, bringing your total sum of debt to $146,200. Ms. Bennett, you're a very brave woman and an inspiration to millions of other women out there suffering as you have. Good luck to you. This court is adjourned. [ALL CRYING] PAT: You know, the pain never really goes away but we've learned to live with it. Our life is so much better now. Somehow resolved, peaceful. The girls are growing into wonderful young women right before my eyes. And believe it or not, I'm in my second year of law school. As for Tommy, well, two hours after the hearing, his wife bailed him out of jail. Then, four weeks later, he began missing his weekly payments. But he caught up quickly when I threatened him with jail again. He still sends me and the girls a hundred dollars every week.
