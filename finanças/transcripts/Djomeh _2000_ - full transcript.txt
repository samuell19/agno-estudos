Djomeh! Hey! We're in Iran, not in our home country. So, when we have problems here, We must ask for advice from an Afghan, or consult a Marabout. Are you listening to me, or what? Djomeh! I hear you. Did you go to see a Marabout? I asked, did you see a Marabout? No, I didnít. I was told you did. Why did you go there? I didn't. Someone asked me. Couldnít he go there himself? He wanted me to do it. Open the door for Mr. Mahmoud. Good morning. Close the door, don't let the cows get out. Hello. Whatís new? Habib? Yes? Come here. Good morning, how are you? I think the radiator needs water. I'll take care of it. How is the cow? Sheís not well. I'm talking about the Holstein cow. I understood. She is sick, she has diarrhea. Quick, take care of the car. I want to see the cow. Itís dark in here. Wait, Iíll turn on the light. Later, load the canisters. Weíre in a hurry. Isn't the veterinarian coming? I'm going to call him. Letís go. Where are you going? I want to change my clothes. Did Mr. Golom get his milk? Yes, some time ago. He took two 25 kilogram canisters. Did he pay? No, he didnít pay. Write down what he owes. Yes, itís done. Me, Iím distracted sometimes. But, I take note of everything. You have to clean thoroughly here. Where is the guy? Hey! Djomeh! Come on, weíre going to be late. Fill the radiator or it will explode. Iím coming. Let me check the cow. I'll ask the veterinarian to come this afternoon. Hurry, Mr. Mahmoud is leaving. Habib, nothing is wrong with this cow. You scared me for nothing. She must be better now. Hurry up. Go, go... I have soap in my eyes. Iíll open the door, watch the cows. Run, Djomeh! Finally, hurry! Why do you make yourself so fancy looking? Hurry, weíre late. Close the door. We didnít stop at Nazarabad? Aren't we going there? Wonít we buy milk there? They do have it for sale. Don't you want the money? Yes, but they are too savvy. Are we going straight to Shokrabad? Yes. What time is it? A worker doesn't need to know the time. Is someone waiting for you? No, I'm just asking. I doubt it! You must have a reason. No, I'm not in any hurry. You look like you're going to a wedding! No, there's no wedding. My work clothes smelled like cow. I donít want anyone to say I smell bad. A cowherder needn't worry about that. But you, you always practice good hygiene. Thanks for noticing. May I ask you a question? Why hasn't he married? Sorry? Why is Habib still not married? What do you care? Mind your own business. Besides, what do you need to know about it? I didn't want to disturb him. Excuse me. Sorry. First, let's take care of our business. Are you talking about cows? Yes. Habib and me, are we part of the herd? Thank you very much, Mr. Mahmoud. Here in Iran, it is your custom to marry late. I used to work in a pasta factory. My boss was 40 years old, and still a bachelor. For you, is it old? Being a 40 year old man? With us, we say that it is "Kil". What does that mean, "Kil"? Up to 40 years old, we are straight as a yew tree. Later, by 50, 60 years old... We slouch, we become "Kil". According to you, I'm "Kil"? No, not you, boss! I wasn't talking about you. In Afghanistan, our customs are different. The girls and the boys, they must marry before the age of 20, otherwise, it is frowned upon. Why? People gossip. What do they say? That the boy is impotent, or that the girl is not virgin. And you, 20 years old, not married... Are you complaining? No... Well, yes. They still say things. Like what? I can't tell you everything. Habib has told me things. What did he say? That you weren't in trouble there, and you didn't come here for the money. Were you in politics? No, I don't know anything about that. A problem with your family? Yes. Don't do stupid things, don't screw up your life. I had problems with my father, I ran away, I wandered the streets. Trouble happens everywhere. Everyone has difficulties. But, I'm afraid you'll make yourself miserable, that you won't be realistic about it. Don't get angry with anyone, you will regret it. It's not that at all. Me, I get along well with my family. My mother is very young, I have three sisters, they all love me very much. In fact, it's really my fault... I made them lose face. How? I'll tell you if you don't mind. You are like a big brother. No problem. I don't want to bore you. No, go ahead. In Afghanistan, I fell in love with a woman older than me. Twelve years older. Married? No, she has no husband. She had one before, he had a very serious illness, he died of it, poor man. Oh, okay. No, it's nothing bad. He was a good man, everyone liked him. May God bless his soul! And then? We wanted to get married, but my family opposed it. Why are we stopping, boss? Weíre at the village. Finish your story, then we'll get to work. I'm finished. I told you everything. We couldn't get married, her family believed our marrying not proper, mine thought that she tricked me. Since you loved her so much, why didn't you take her to live elsewhere? It was not possible. I couldn't do that... I would have embarrassed her. Does Habib know? Of course he knows. I was entrusted to his care when I came here. He's like an older brother. There's war everywhere out there, it's difficult... No work, no money, no nothing. Surely you came here to make money? No. It's was so that she could remarry. She may have done it already, and is happy. I was just standing in her way. The big one is empty. Good morning, Mr. Seyed. Congratulations! Congratulations on your wedding! How much is there? One and a half kilos. Look out! That stone barely missed us! I'll get you, you brats! When we were kids, we did the same. How much is it? For you? Two and a half kilos. Three kilos for you, two and a half for you. Mine is five kilos. You're wrong. It's what the scale shows. You are wrong. Look at the mark. Look. That's three kilos. No, you're wrong. Let's weigh it again. What happened? Take your hand off, take it off. What's the matter? I have five kilos and he says it's three! There was five kilos? Yes. It's not a problem, I... No, we better make sure. So, here, 500 tomans. Thatís good. God will give it back. And you? What do you know about God, you? Hello. One and three-quarter kilos. You weighed the empty bucket. One and a half kilos. So, how much is it? One and a half. How is Mr. Abbas? Is it cow's milk or sheepís milk? Sheep. Why did you close the windows, scared? I'm sewing up my pants. Leave some thread. I want to do mine. I couldn't find the matching color. Hand me the kettle. It's not ready yet. Isn't it hot? No. This stove works like Mr. Mahmoud. He always forgets to add more fuel. The stove is not good, but Mr. Mahmoud is great. If he was so great, we would have fuel. Forget it. Regardless, he's a good man. When it comes to milk, he doesn't forget. At least the stove works. You say good things about him. It seems that he seduced you. If he offers to put your money in the bank, to put it at short or medium term, with interest or premiums, donít do it. Keep your money in your pocket. I'm not talking about money or profit, but about his human qualities. His cows, giving milk morning and evening, are more human. Anyone who doesn't care about others is not human. Where are you going? To the store, Iíll be right back. We don't need anything! Hay must be cut. I'll be right back. What are you going to do there? Iíll be back soon. Hello. Hello. I would like five loaves, two kilos of potatoes, two onions and three cans of preserves. Okay. Do you have four pocket shirts? My father can order some. In Afghanistan, we prefer them. Itís convenient, four pockets. But here, men wear single pockets. How much? This scarf? How much? 2000 tomans. This one too? They are all the same price. I have a sister in Afghanistan, she is nineteen years old. A year and a half older than you, right? I would like to buy her a scarf. Which one would you choose? The scarves are one size fits all. I wasn't talking about the size. Men donít have the same tastes as women. Which do you prefer? This one? Or this one? The first. The white one with the flowers. Okay, Iíll take it. Setareh! Yes? Is your father here? Call him. Tell him to bring me my bill. Miss Setareh... How much do I owe you? With the scarf, 3100 tomans. Boy! Are you the cowherder? Yes. How will you pay for what you buy here? Does Mr. Abbas give you credit? I pay cash. How much do you earn? I am salaried. Are you paid daily or monthly? It's the same either way. Do you make 30000? Less. I thought so. Interesting... Why do you stay, if not? We don't have a choice. We are workers. Do you send money home? I save. The family counts on me. If the war ends, will you go back home? Yes, but others will come here. That's not true. Nobody will come here. Not one! Goodbye. Don't sulk, come back. I wasn't speaking about you. God's land belongs to everyone. Now there is war in Afghanistan, so you came here. Isnít that true? In Iran there is no war. Isn't that true? Yes. Our young people, they go to work in Japan. The young Japanese, they go to America. Human beings often believe that elsewhere... The grass is always greener. Do not take it badly, I wasn't criticizing you. The land belongs to everyone. You understand me? Yes. Did you buy rice? I'll get it this afternoon. It's from Thailand. It is cheap. This afternoon. Come whenever you want. Goodbye. Who is he? The cowherder. Djomeh! Where were you? At the shop. Where is it? In Kabul? You're late. It's a long ride, and it's cold. What did you buy? Preserves. Always preserves! You should have gotten eggs. There are some. Well then! Go, go! Hey, Djomeh! Then come right back. The cow is sick. Come on, hurry up! I'm coming. Bring the bucket. Get the pills from my pocket. Hold her head up! Leave me alone. Go cut some hay, wimp! I gave my youth to a beautiful girl. But sadly, my youth has passed. It is gone and so is my love. Are you singing to the cow? The song reminds me of home. Go get the stove ready for dinner. Take her away. I'm finished. Okay. Mister Habib? What, "Mister Habib"? Before, you just called me "Habib". Do you want money, or what? No, I'd just like to talk to you. Go on, I'm listening. When you return to Afghanistan, I won't go with you. Impossible. This summer, I must see my family, and take you to yours. I will write a letter for them, with a picture. Tell them I'll be back in about two years. It's useless, a letter. Why would you want to stay here? You donít have money problems, do you? It's not a question of money. Money does not solve all the problems. So what? Lighten up... This discussion is over! You're making a mistake, and yes, it's over. Mr. Habib, I am no longer a child, I know what I'm doing. I have decided not to go. I didn't sign anything. That's enough! Go back to your work. We don't need a contract between us! And don't think of staying here. Hello, Mr. Mahmoud. Hello, how are you? Not good. I haven't slept because of the cow. What is wrong with her? I called the veterinarian. He will come this afternoon. Make this area clean. I don't want to be embarrassed. Hurry up. Habib! Yes? Why is it so dirty in here? Look at that pile of manure! That's what makes her sick. Clean thoroughly, or the veterinarian will fine me. I'm on it as soon as you leave. Did you break something? It's no big deal. What am I going to do about you? And this sack, here? We take care of the milk first, and then we'll clean up the rest, the sacks, the alfalfa... What a mess! How much is your thought? What? How much does your thought cost? We say "a penny for your thoughts". That's a local expression. I don't speak your language well. When I worked at the pasta factory, the boss said that all the time. Everybody took it literally at first. Then we understood that it was just an expression. You are naive, you believe everything you are told. Mr. Mahmoud, I'm sorry to bore you with my stories. No problem. At the farm, I have no one else to talk to. So, when you are here, I feel that I can empty my heart, that I can confide in you. I don't mind. Tell me. Maybe I shouldn't. You are the boss, I am a worker. I only know how to talk like a worker. I am the boss? Yes. In your country, when someone has cows, is he a boss? It depends, Mr. Mahmoud. A man who writes, who wears glasses, he is an office manager. A man like you, he is a business manager. So I'm a business manager? Yes. Aren't you talking to Habib? Yes, of course. But it's useless. He doesn't listen to me. He doesn't understand me. Yet you are from the same area. But that's how our countrymen are. When we do something stupid, they always remember it. But do someone a hundred favors, that, they forget it right away. Always, I am reminded of my mistakes. But do you acknowledge your mistakes? Do you acknowledge them? Mistakes? No, I don't. They were wrong about me, they judged me without knowing me. I was misunderstood. They don't want to see the truth. Only the flaws. You don't know them, they have no faith in me. Mr. Mahmoud, if I have problems in Tehran, would you help me? It depends on the problem. You know that Habib must return to his country, go back to his family. Me, I don't want to go back... Because of my problems. I'm fine alone on the farm. I will hire a second worker. Work doesn't scare me. I think that if we are happy, we can move mountains. Bringing in the hay is easy. How can you enjoy working alone? I believe that... Everything is better when we can confide in someone. Someone who listens to you, who understands you. Talk to me. Tell me your sorrows. I'm here. No, it's more than that. You are here only in the morning. I mean someone who would be there all the time, and whom I could trust. You're not thinking about marriage, are you? Yes. Here in Iran? Yes. God willing, right here. But be realistic, my friend, you know the situation here. You don't have a house... Yes, but Habib is going back home. I would repaint the barn, clean it thoroughly. It will be nice there. In the stable? We can build a dividing wall... On the one side, work, on the other, home. We'll be fine. She will help me and I will help her, it will be very good. What is this, build a wall? You're speaking nonsense! It's not yet done. I just thought about it. Have you thought about consulting me? Have you thought of helping? What do you think? I donít know. Even if the hygiene passes inspection, they'll still say it's a stable, not a dwelling. If we can't live here, weíll rent a small room, weíll live in the village. There? Where the kids throw stones at you? They'll get over it, theyíll grow up. Everything will be alright. It's nice there. You are up to something. Who, me? Smart ass! You mean, marriage? Don't do that, Mr. Mahmoud. What will people say? Stop! Really, stop that horn... Thank you very much! No more! People will talk. How much is that? 455 tomans. Plus the 25 from yesterday. That'll be 580 tomans. No, 480. Two kilos. Thanks. Goodbye. How much is it? Don't do that, it's not right. You're going to get in trouble. Stop it! Cow's milk or sheep's milk? Cow. How much did you say? Three kilos. Three kilos? Yes. Stop it, kids, let us work. How much was it? Three kilos. There you go, 250. Here. Thank you. No problem. I told you to stop. What a pain. Get out! Congratulations! All my best wishes. Three and a half kilos. Cow's or sheep's milk? Cow. This is the second time. Watch out! Who is getting married? That's one and a half kilos. One and a half? Here you are, 150 tomans. Thank you. Thank you, goodbye. Who, you said? The Amiri's. The daughter? I'm going for bread. Iíll be right back. No, the milk will get sour. Let's go. The veterinarian is coming. There is no bread left. Okay, but hurry up. His youngest daughter? Yes. Hello. Are you here for the rice? I don't have enough money. No matter. You can pay later. Mr. Mahmoud is waiting for me. I'll come back for the rice. Give me some bread for our lunch. How many loaves do you want? Three. Take four. That's 20 tomans. Thank you very much. Here. Thanks again. Hello. Are you doing well? Yes thanks. Are you ready, boys? Get your hands up... Whoever catches the ray, wins. One, two, three! Higher! Higher... Climb up there! The one in the red pants? The one climbing at the door? Yes, yes, higher... Get it! Higher! Didn't you buy anything? They ran out of fresh bread. Get in, we're leaving. Let me play. No. We have to go. Come on, get in. We're leaving. I should've gone earlier, been back earlier. You, we know when you leave, but never when you come back. What did you write there? Where? Fourth line. Cans of preserves. Preserves? More preserves? It is full. There are too many. I get it, you know. It's just an excuse to go there. You're wasting money. Preserves! Move the radio. You're right, shopping is a pretext. It's true. Potatoes, onions... Everything is an excuse. I swear it's important, but I can tell you nothing. To me, you can't tell me anything. But to a stranger, yes! I've already talked to you. But you don't listen to me. You do not understand me. What do I not understand? I know your family, we are from the same area... And I don't understand you! But a foreigner, he understands you. It's none of my business. Do what you want. But we are here to work. If Mr. Mahmoud asks where you are, what do I say? My honor is at stake. The veterinarian is coming. Well, there he is. Go open the door. Hello doctor. Close it, I'm not driving inside. So, a cow's giving you trouble again? Come in, doctor. Where is Mr. Mahmoud? Iím short on time, so, Mr. Mahmoud... Bring me my satchel. Hello doctor. Hello, how is she? Come on, it's this way. Which one is it? The Holstein there. Her again? Did you give her some medicine? Go make some tea. Did she take her pills? She took them all. How long has she been sick? Three days. Djomeh! Mr. Abbas! It did not break. I would like four loaves, and five eggs. Add three cans of preserves, a kilo of lentils, a kilo of split peas, a kilo of Thai rice, and a sweet bread. You probably know that... When I shop here, there is a reason. I know that here... If a man speaks to a woman he doesn't know, it is frowned upon. It makes people talk. I'm a Muslim, too. But different. It's just the customs, which are not the same... Between us. I don't have anyone else here. All my family are in Afghanistan. If you allow me... Do you know Mr. Mahmoud? If you give permission, I will ask him to go see your father to make my request. I know you dare not... talk to me. If anyone comes in... I will be quiet. I don't know what else to say. If his answer is no, I won't be angry. I won't do anything. I will be sad, but I will understand. You have a different situation than me. It's not reasonable for me to insist. It's not appropriate. I do not have a lot of money on me. I'll just take the bread and eggs. The rest was a pretext, just to talk to you longer. Your bike is gone! Hello. Take that first. The eggs are fragile. Take your change. Goodbye. Thank you. Hello Habib. I tried to hurry, but I fell off my bike. Look what I did. I had bought eggs, but they all broke. We will eat preserves! If you continue, we'll have nothing but cans! Moron, you've already created trouble for your parents, and here, you want to dishonor me! What have I done? You knew very well that the doctor was coming, and you took off. I didn't lie. I had something important to do. It wasn't a sin. Mr. Mahmoud won't say anything. If he fires me, it's my problem. What will you tell him? Will you tell him about your problems? Have you no shame? He tells me about his worries, and I tell him about mine. That's no excuse. You really have no shame. He said to me "Where is Djomeh?" I said you went to buy bread. And he says "Bread or a woman?" Aren't there enough women back home? We have lots of them. Why get married in Iran? No matter where you are, you think you must be in love. Have some respect, Habib. And you, do you respect me? You're half my age and you've already lost your head twice. Others are good cowherders, you are only good for womanizing. You overwhelm me. Be careful. Otherwise, what? Let me... You have dishonored me. I will teach you to not talk such nonsense. Habib! Yes? Haven't you finished yet? I have one more to milk. Hurry up. Where is Djomeh? He's upstairs. He is sick, he is sleeping. What's wrong with him? This is not the time. Maybe it's the weather. Keep going. I'll go up to see him. I've asked a hundred times, clean up here. Or you too will end up sick. You have to flush with plenty of water. Iíll finish loading the milk first. Hurry up. We have a lot to do. Hello. Stay calm, lay down. What a smell! It's no wonder that you're sick. I'm sorry for being late yesterday. So, are you forgetting about your job? Your petty affairs, they are more important? I wanted to get back quickly, but I couldn't. What happened? I had a bicycle accident. With the bike? Yes. I'm ready. Let's go? I'm coming. Show me. Where does it hurt? My side hurts. And? It's heartache. No, that's not it. Might be the appendix. Get up, the milk will go sour. On the way, we'll stop at the doctor's. Leave him here. No. I'm worried. He needs to see a doctor. Let him rest. No. You go to work. What did you tell him? Why did you argue? We didn't argue... Well yes, we did. It's my fault. Poor Habib, he is afraid of being fired. And me, I can't help it. Everyone does what he must do. So what is it? It's that... The truth is that... I can't control myself. I donít know how to tell you... You, I think... You have never been attracted to anyone. So you can't understand me. What are you babbling about? Be a man, do your job. When the time is right, you can get married. Be patient. I believe you think it's a duty for me to marry. Me, I do not agree. You told me that in Afghanistan, people must get married before they're 20. That's it. It's a duty, it's not love... Girls and boys, they must marry before the age of 20. Isn't that an obligation? No? Every time youíre in my car, you're talking about marriage. How many times do I have to repeat to you that you are in Iran, here? When you are able to take on a family, you can get married. If I spoke of duty, it was a way to start a conversation, an excuse to talk about what I feel. In Afghanistan, when I was in love with this woman, I was not yet 20 years old. She was much older. No one understood me there. You neither, you do not understand. When I decided to come here, I swore to myself to stay single until I was 30. That I would not marry. I didn't feel ready to fall in love. But it doesn't happen like that, while just casually walking around! No, probably not. But, I think... Love at first sight, it can happen in a few seconds, while sometimes, it can take an eternity. For you, in an instant, for me, an eternity? I don't think you will. Well, it's possible, but... you are too busy. You always think about your business, fattening the cows... no room for anything else in your head, no room for love. I'm not saying that you can't, but it's stronger than you... stronger than me... I really can't control it. It must be hereditary, it must come from our parents. You don't like this kind of talk. What? It's nothing new! I donít know. Maybe you're right. I didn't know my mother, And, as soon as I opened my eyes, I had to earn my bread. You know, I was lucky to grow up on my mother's lap. I also have three older sisters. I have the feeling that... Tenderness and love are transmitted by women. Men give us responsibilities and camaraderie. That's really what I believe. Do you want me to push? Dumbass! She's over 20 too, isn't she... your car? My car is "Kil", like me? No, not you. But if... No, you're not "Kil". I allowed myself to speak with Setareh. I told her that you would go see her father. But! I told you clearly not to plan on it. Why didn't you talk to me first? Mr. Mahmoud, I only have you here. I can't do it by myself. It's none of my business. Let it be! Aren't you a Muslim? We believe that... the one who brings together two young people, he is doing a good deed. I'm really not a good negotiator. Otherwise, I would consider it. Habib, he won't. And even if he did, they wouldn't trust an Afghan. Don't bring me into this. I do not want to lose my business. Why should I meddle in this? Congratulations! Miss Amiri, congratulations. Congratulations! All our best wishes for happiness. Djomeh! Come up front. My head hurts, I need air. Get in, I tell you. I need to talk to you. Come on, come on. What's her name? Miss Setareh. She takes care of the shop, behind the mosque. You're going there today, aren't you? What? You are going to request her in marriage for me? They will hardly accept a stranger. We saw in the village girls get married to boys, but not to a stranger... that, never! They are a bit conservative. No problem. I understand. I will accept all their conditions if they allow me to live with her. If it's money, I will ask for help from my family. Do all you can to bring us together. I will see what I can do. I really appreciate it. You are great. Thank you, thank you very much. I can't thank you enough. I will be grateful until my death. What is this? To make the request, you have to bring cakes. Save your money. No, it's not a big deal. Don't we need to go to the doctor? I'm fine. What? I'm better. Was it a feigned illness? I was in real pain, but it's better. Youíre healthy? Absolutely. So save your money. Please, I insist. You will offend me. But it's almost nothing. Save it. It's not important, really. Keep it, I tell you. I want to buy it myself. It's my wedding cake! It's a done deal, right? Excuse my cheek. I am too happy, that's why. Can I ask you something else? When you have seen them, will you right away come tell me the answer? I know it's a long drive, that you will be tired. But for me, it's ten times worse. It's terrible to wait. I'll see what I can do. Thank you, thank you very much, Mr. Mahmoud. Are you still waiting? Mr. Mahmoud will not come. He would already be here. Listen to me, Djomeh. If I'm sometimes hard on you, do not be angry. You are like a little brother to me. I have many responsibilities. If I get angry, it's because I'm sad too. I didn't leave everything on a whim to come here, to live with cows. Under this moon, here, on this earth, nothing is easy. But God is compassionate. Keep the stove with you. Don't stay outside, it's cold. Iíll take care of the cows. Open the little door. I hired another man. Congratulations. Thanks. Are you okay? The man will help you. You will teach him. Are the cows milked? It's almost done. Take this. Where is Djomeh? He's here. He's changing. Is he expecting me? Yes. Take care of this. As I said, we have a new worker. Why? To help you. He will leave in a few days. Where is the scale? In the warehouse. Here? Talk to Djomeh. Try to reason with him. Itís better to forget. I don't want to fire him. Hello. Give me this. Go get another canister. Where are the weights? I couldn't find them. Put that next to the barrel. Did you find them? No. They are near the sink. Put them in the car. Return these empty canisters. What did Mr. Mahmoud tell you? You and your Mr. Mahmoud! He told me to tell you not to worry. In life, there are ups and downs. You shouldn't have spoken to him about affairs of the heart. You should have told me. I would have found a way. Come on, pull yourself together and get back to work. God is great. How are you? Good. Won't you take me with you? For the moment, itís better not to. Here, have a cake. I don't want any. Taste them! I do not want it. Is this your new worker? He will help us for a while. Eat. I do not want it. Here! Last night, I waited a long time for you. Have you been there? I'll tell you about it later. Eat your cake. Goodbye. Djomeh! Come, come on. Let's go. Let's get back to work. A closed door always opens eventually. You will make me melancholy. Life is a spinning wheel. We can't always draw the winning number. A flower with thorns retains its fragrance longer. Surely there is a reason fo that. Don't be sad, stay hopeful. That's life. There will be better days... Translation Ma mad HAGHIGHAT Adaptation Marie-Claire CAMBOU Video captioning: C.M.C.
