West Texas, And seven years later. Members Amish have taught us that what really they matter in the life... he is a God, the family and the soil under his feet. the rest, nothing more matters. The technology has promised us a better future. But the technology has betrayed us. Who can say why? - Zach. - Because the technology is bad. And why is the technology bad? Because Satan it uses it to touch us. And children, Which is his favorite weapon? - Computers and mobile phones. - Like that it is. And how do they propagate the evil? - Across Wi-Fi. - Well.

Well, it is time for you to go away, Zach. Now. Veto from here. seeker4u2: hello janessa I do not call janessa then how do you call Justine. And you Justine. where are you now adam? in the city Justine. in what city? nobody goes there. I yes. - I have more questions. - What do you want to know? I do not even know where to start. - It starts where you want. - It is well. How is it so, is a network yet? The network never fell down. Why did not the pest give to you? He wanted to live more than the majority. How is it quite there? Kept silent, without traffic, very calmed. You go where you want and nobody says to you what to do. How is the place in that you are? Brilliant, if you like the camps of refugees and the martial law. Of that time is Janessa your fianc?e? No, it was the user's name of your IP. My fianc?e Salwa was living in Egypt. Where is she now? It gave him the illness. I am sorry about it. I suppose that you must miss it very much. Although the lovers get lost, the love will not get lost. - That is beautiful. - Dylan Thomas. - Who is it? - The favorite Salwa poet, and mine. Was it nice? As a princess of Arabian Nights. It sounds exotic. Jet had black hair and a few eyes incredible coffees... ...and a spot in the cheek that was shaming it... ...but that's why it was so beautiful. I believe that I hate it. You might not avoid to want it. And you, Justine? Are you nice? - I do not know. - That means that yes. - It means that I do not know it. - How old are you? Twenty-two. Honestly? In fact I have 17. I thought that. - What do you mean with that? - I do not know. Only I am trying to imagine you. With or without clothes? This would be my secret. I hate the secrets. The world is full of secrets. I want to meet you, Justine. I do not know if it could do that. Do you have fianc?? - No. - Then, what? Justine. Looking for someone Justine: where are you? Yes, you do that But it is not going to happen It is not going to happen I suppose that I have some fear. You risked much more when you lit the computer. Only that says everything to me what I need to know about you... ...and everything what you need to know about yourself. One day you have felt the class of solitude that is worse than the death? It is as if you had a voice inside your skull... ...that never stops shouting because they never listen to it. Yes, all the time I feel like that... ...except when I am with you. Everything is based on the connection, truth? In knowing that we are not alone in the universe. Nothing more matters. You are the only one that understands me, Adam. My adoptive parents are so busy surviving... ...that do not realize that in fact are already not alive. Alone they continue the movements. And why? He would prefer to die to live like that. Mami, mami. I love my mami. I love my mami. ...aba to Speak - GOD I saw a tree with human bones hanging like adornments. The meal is scarce. Some persons do the unthinkable thing. I am afraid, Adam. The fear is good, it keeps you alive. I do not see the hour of seeing you, Adam. You loaded the battery of the computer before going away? Yes. Well. Her use little from now on. It is getting dark. I will stop in a farm. It seems empty. Be careful. Gasoline Hello? Calm. I am not going to hurt you. Even without the people around it keeps on cultivating cotton. Why? This is what I do. So you escaped of a refugees' camp? Not too bad. - Good... - And where do you go, exactly? - To the city. - You know that you should not. - The city is prohibited. - This was not what I heard. Indeed? Who said the opposite to you? A friend. And how does your friend know how are the things in the city? It is there now. Do you continue in contact with him? How? - More than everything with text messages. - What? Do you have a phone? Computer? Bluetooth? What? No, not, not, please not. Please, please, do not destroy it. I will go away. I will go away already same. I will not cause him any more problems, I swear it. I cannot throw anybody like that in the middle of the night. Especially to a youngster as you. This remains here. You will have it again in the morning. And do not try to get here to extract it. I have two good ears. There is a guests' quarter for the corridor to the left. It is not elegant at all, is it well? Thanks. Thank you very much, mister Wilkie. I forgot to mention... ...that there is another ridge-tile in the closet if it gives you cold. The bath is for the corridor to the right. You know... ...since he died my wife Sarah, I... I have not had the custom of raising the lid. So be careful. That you sleep well. Justine. Adam? - Are you? - I need you, Justine. Adam, show me your face. I need you so much. Why do not you show me your face? - Do you promise not to leave me? - Yes. - I promise it. - Never? Never. Excuse me, Father. I will not be weak. No, no. God, the solitude. It has spent so much time. I will take it. No, not, no. I will not be weak. God, I ask you for force. Coffee and oats, when you are ready. Very well, it is better that I go away. Very well, yes. Yes. - If o?ste a little yesterday evening... - No. No, I slept like a baby. Very well, if me o?ste speaking, it is... Very well, it is something that I do because I am a lot of alone time and... Yes, no. I understand. I also I speak alone, you know, all the time. Very well, I have a few conversations you miss in my head. On the good and evil. The sin. And the death. It is not healthy. To have all that in my head like that it is... Simply it is not healthy. - Good. - Yes. Is she sure that you want to do this? - What do you mean? - To go to the city. Yes, yes. It is... I do not know, it is difficult to explain. It is one of these things that one has to do. Yes. It is well. Well. Look after. You also. Veto already. Saint Biblia Damned he-goat. You must not have returned, Justine. Help. Remain with the computer, please. It is his, but allow me to go. - You are a charming girl. - Please, allow me to go. You look alike greatly to my Sarah when I knew it. - Do not do this. - What thing? - To violate me. - No. God, no. It might never touch another woman that way. Do not you understand? I love my wife. She it is quite for me. I miss it so much. My beautiful Sarah. My sweet, beautiful Sarah. I have thought about her every minute of every hour... ...of every day from the moment in that the devil took it from me. I thought of committing suicide very much. But I know that the Gentleman he hates the suicide... ...as much as he hates what we did to him to his world. Finally I realized of that there was a form of revivirla. But it was too much late. By that time, there was already no electricity. All the devices of telecommunication... ...they were damaged or without battery. Or I was thinking that... ...until you came. It cannot revivirla, mister Wilkie. It cannot do that. And this way be able to do it, it will not be what you believe. As this friend of yours. - My friend is alive. - And why are you so sure? I will say to you why. Because in fact it does not matter for the people as we. We need what we need. Allow me to go, he does not need me for this. I believe that perhaps yes he needs you. Because famine gives you to them. Sarah? What happened? Sarah. It returns to me, Sarah. Sarah. My god. Sarah. I missed you. I missed you so much. I did not change anything. I left everything as you like. Here it looks, looks. I even kept all your small stone bric-a-brac... ...in the china cupboard. No. No. No, Sarah. That is not necessary. Already not. Here I am. Now I am here. I will not turn to go. Never again I will return to leave that you suffer. I know it hurt that you are. I brought to you something from mitigation, if you need it. This time I did not act well with you, Sarah? No? No, not, not, Sarah. Sarah, Sarah, you do not have to do that. Again not, never again. Sarah. God, no. God, no. Sarah. God, not, no. I do not support it. - God, no. - Wilkie. Extinguish the computer. - God, no. - Wilkie, extinguishes the computer. Extinguish the computer. - God, no. - Wilkie, extinguishes the computer! Wilkie. Wilkie, care. Wilkie. Wilkie, care. Wilkie. Wilkie, move away from her. Wilkie. Wilkie, care. Care. Wilkie. Where? Where is it this place? It cannot be. What do they want? Why she? Alone is a girl. It escaped. He is not anybody. he looks for adam God. Who are you in fact, Adam? I need to know the truth right now... ...or I cannot to go forward with this. Not later from what I have just gone on. Everything will be revealed. I hate to criticize your bullshit to you, Adam, but fortune teller what... ...I am not your small fanatic or disciple... ...or what you create that you found in me. I am ready to go away to house right now. Where is your house? What is your house? Lump it. You need me so much how I to you, Justine. At least let's be honest. The fact is that I am afraid: is it well? A lot of, a lot of fear. You do not have why to be afraid. That does not console me, I feel it. I have just seen a man to whom his dead wife started the entrails. If they loved you, they would have already taken you. - How do you know it? - I know it. And you also. Do you control them? The battery is finishing you. Do you control them? I will be waiting. Street Five with Olive. - Do not change the topic. - The time is finished. - Time that we do not have. - What do you mean? Only you can save me Adam? Adam. Idiot. Adam. Adam: where are you? I cannot already do this. God. It cannot be. Really are you? It has spent so much time... ...but I never forgot. I spoke to you... ...for years... ...as if you were always there... ...it surrounds. Did you listen to me when I spoke to you? And always... ...I was trying to imagine your face... ...but finally... ...I came to the point in which it could not even already do that. And you simply... ...you disappeared... ...except in my sleep. It still saw you in my sleep. And it was rising the same question to you repeatedly. Why? Why did you do what you did? And you never gave me an answer. And he hated you that's why, hated you. Why did you do it? Why did you ruin everything? It hurts me And was not it hurting me? What can I do, mom? What can I do to arrange it? How can I detain the pain? It finds Adam How do you know of A...? Mom. Mom, please do not go away. Mom, please. Please. Come, child. Take it. We go. That is. We go, forward. It is well. I understand. I also am afraid. We go, the company would come to me well. Since you want. Brilliant. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? ...you set off especially designed for... ...engineers to hold the missile and used to re-calculate positions. Many rockets explosive charges they were prepared to shoot... ...in and about the area of detonation of weapon, information... ...on fundamental physics of the first phenomenon. We will examine the effects of the ambience of... ...nuclear detonations to 50 kilometers, 100 kilometers... ...and 250 kilometers of altitude. In another sight, a wave of shock it seemed to run towards out... ...of the radiation front to a temperature... ...of approximately 10000 grades. The miscellany enfriadora of fire and debris, which it is already not luminous... ...it keeps on increasing and expanding between a 40 kilometers diameter... Hello? Hello? Do not touch that. What do you want? I meet you. Seven years ago you kidnapped our car. - What? - You did that dad was stealing... ...an electronic shop. - For God. Chatty Cathy. - Where is Adam? - Adam? Yes, Adam. It gave me this direction, he said to me that it would be here. Who is Adam? I do not meet Adam. You have to know it. I know whom I meet and I do not meet any Adam. I don't understand. What are you doing to her? It is his turn to suffer. You cannot do that, it is not well. It is inhuman. This is a war. The first rule of the war it is to meet your enemy. What can you learn on having had it shut up that way? Very well, first that quite... ...they feel pain. - That is useful. - Basting. - Basting. - Do not touch me. Never. Unless he asks you for it. - Do you understand? - It is well, is well. Understood. You should be dead walking round there this way without protection. Since I it am not, obviously. And I am afraid that that it needs a big reconsideration. Perhaps be wrong with all this... ...and I am the test. - Of what? - Of that they try of hurting us. - At least, already not. - Indeed? After killing four fifth ones of the planet do they want the peace? I will say to you what I believe. I believe that they are using you to come to me. - Nobody is using me. - No? Who is this Adam? How do you know it? Sure. For seven years they could not touch me. This was going to happen sooner or later. You do not believe that you are little paranoiac? The paranoia is the only thing that keeps me alive. Why to bother so much to come to you? Because I can give them life. Not only it empties it and cruel imitation of the life. I speak about the life really. And what stops them? The barrier, the red color. It is the frequency that cannot penetrate. - And can you arrange that? - In fact, already I arranged it. - What is that? - A program to cancel the red one. Then you they go to help to cross? So that the dead persons be able to repopulate the Earth? That would not be good. This is for me. This is my return ticket... ...if the worst thing happens. Y... ...this way I pray so that it never happens. - What are you doing? Protecting a few crucial assets. It enters. No. Forgive me if I made you think that was asking for it. It enters. They are not the enemy, you do not have anything of that to be afraid: truth? I will take that. Thanks. We will continue this conversation later. Assuming that exists one later. I need water. Sorry. Sorry. 1 speaks Zebra: does it copy me? Mister colonel: does he listen to me? I copy you, Zebra 1, forward. I found the problem in my group of numbers. It was right with the reflex ionosf?rico... ...but I did not think in the inverse dispersion. Once I connected the coefficient correct, everything went out well. Insurance? Alone we have 24 hours. Is it well? I say to you that only we have an opportunity. I am sure. Everything is clear for this side. - Are you well there inside? - No. It lasts. It is not missing a lot of time. What must I do? Of: Stranger IT TAKES THE UNIT SINCE YOU COULD Of the side whom am I? I need to go out from here. The atoll Johnston was the center of throwing and experimentation... ...for the rocket of 1962... - Allow me to go out. In any moment, in any moment. Namely you do not know how many times... ...I have thought of paying the maximum sorrow. It might end with everything right here... ...a shot in the head, end of the history. The problem is that immediately it would be out of this door... ...crying like a wet cat to enter again. And this is the problem. But to solve problems of theoretical nature it is mine. He remembers, these things, these bogeys, for this way saying it... ...there are products of electromagnetic transmission. That is quite, glorified problems of radio. Inseparable of his way of delivery. So it is logical, it is a fact... ...a conjecture or since you want to call it, that if... ...you disorder all... ...the forms of transmission electromagnetic simultaneously, ours... ...small bogeys would stay prevented for saying it less. And if this disorder was sufficiently big, very big... ...and here it is where the thing becomes ugly... ...you can finish them completely. Like that it is, an electromagnetic pulsation. A PEM... ...along such a wide area that guarantees that there is no way out. Do you continue well there inside? Where was it? Depression fakes the suicide... ...PEM, yes, yes, the point. The real point is this: You must cause the electromagnetic shock... ...more possible concentrate. And this would be a nuclear bomb, prostitute's children. With megatonaje sufficient... ...it will eliminate well-known forms of electromagnetic transmission. Hiroshima, mon amour, the big one. Stoop and cover you, but it becomes better... ...or worse depending on your appetite for the Apocalypse. You might not leave with yours only with a nuclear bomb, no. No, you would need merry many to guarantee an entire covering... ...what the army one day it called functional disorder. About the world up to the eternity. And for that... ...you would need and like a dear quite conservative... Here it is. ...87 heads, detonated one for one every 60 seconds... ...with a production of ten megatons... ...and a 400 kilometers height on the soil... ...that of course is... ...to receive the big event thermonuclear global... ...that we all have tried to avoid desperately for 60 years. It is well, this is the worst part and yes, it is quite serious. It is well, it is not possible to do... ...of pretty rose that, but there are encouraging points... ...that do that everything seems almost possible. At least in the role. Very of course... ...our country still has a ballistic capacity with missiles... ...that can send nuclear warheads to specific targets in the world. And these attacks would be realized with little or no opposition... ...because, good, who is going to defend himself, truth? But waiting, this is the good thing. We are speaking from explosions to big altitude. His radioactive rain stays in the current in jet, without hurting. Then your civil victims in ground they limit themselves to thousands, not to million. It is like a cake of chocolate without fault. The whole diversion, none of the calories. This way I explain it to you in girl language. Also, you receive an additional benefit, this way it is. All these simultaneous detonations they would take us to a nuclear winter. Finishing the global warming... ...that we know for the next hundred years. In fact it is something with what they all win, if you think it well. So you do not create that I have been seated here... ...extracting dirt of the bellybutton to me. I am going to arrange this... ...of one or another way. You are much kept silent there. Am I boring you? Certainly, there is a problem of implementation. This is the big obstacle, am I right? That's why, I have been in contact with a major general Haywood Spitz... ...of Colorado Springs using this small device. A simple transmitter infrared recipient... ...which, by the way, your dad... ...it helped to obtain the key piece. Then it works in a frequency of red. It is basically to test of fucked. I am sure that the military high places... ...they thought that he was crazy at first... ...but then they changed opinion. Seven years shut up in a bunker they do that to you. Certainly, also it is difficult to question what 50000 volts per meter... ...they can manage in a fresh air in the autumn morning. You know, lately I have had the mind so clear. It must be the absence of sex. Although perhaps a little of less clarity now does not come to me so badly. Since the big bang it must be to the return of the corner. Perhaps be still able to convince me of that I allowed you to go out. What shit did it spend? Where is it? What did you do? Impertinent Perrita, do not you understand? I am trying to save the world, and do you allow her to go out, tongue is? Really you are going to be sorry about this. This is a Delta 7, Zebra 1: does it copy me? Zebra 1: does it copy me? Zebra 1, answers. Zebra 1, speaks Delta 7. Zebra 1, speaks Delta 7. Adam? I did for what you asked. Do you refer to this? The drummer is dead, do you remember? I have to load it somehow. SYSTEM REINICI?NDOSE LOADING FILE Adam? God. It is like a miracle: truth? Justine. - Justine. - Yes. Finally I can be with you. Finally I can touch you. - It worked. - It worked. Then we can re-live in whom let's want, to my mom and to my dad. To anyone, whom let's love. To anyone. What feels? Adam. - Adam. - God. I have waited for this so much time, tongue is. - Adam. - What? How was it... ...to another side? Why do you ask me about that? I want only to know. Dark. But they always speak about the light. - I say, when you are dying and... - There is no light. Only here. Only here. Who are you? What did you do? You would not understand it. What did you do? Do you want to know it? Indeed do you want to know it? It is like you I said. He wanted to live... ...more than the majority. Too many survivors, very little meal. In this moment it was looking like a good idea. How did you can? How could you kill all of them? Everything stopped mattering for me after Salwa died. I stopped worrying for everything, except for myself. - Like that is the life. - No. No. SYSTEM FAILING I suppose that nobody more it can cross without this. So you do not get with me. He enjoys your new life, Adam. As well as it is. Only. Come, come. The world is very big, Justine. You do not have me to me so that it protects you. To me? I will be well. COMMERCE Call of... Stranger High place. God, I cannot return. God, no. No, no. God, no. Hello. ?l believed that the invasion it would stop... ...and that the radioactive rain it would never come to the soil. Perhaps it was right. In fact I already do not know what to believe. I suppose that I envy to anyone who knows it. Everything what stays now there are the memories. The memories of others, not mine... ...of a world that I will never know. They say that the amish believed... ...that what really it was importing in the life was a God, the family and the ground. In the end, nothing more matters. Neither I am sure of being ready to believe it. At least still not. But I have to admit... ...that is a good beginning.
