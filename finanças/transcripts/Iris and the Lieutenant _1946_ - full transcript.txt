I said no! Thank you, dear ensign. You can't have the car. If you don't like it here you can walk. Call a cab. Pay for it yourself. - Robert can join our car. - No. Then we get to go earlier. That would be better for the kids. You and your husband have been invited to dinner, so what? Don't you have more tact than your brother-in-law? I'll show you! - What is it? - Your wife's leaving. - What do you mean, Greta? - Uncle misreads me. - Robert is having dinner at six. - At Mrs. Asp's? You can get there on your own. - I have business to tend to. With you as boss Oscar Motander's shoe factories have lost 184 accounts. - This door should be closed! - Okay. Greta dear. Greta! Since father left the factory all the models are awful. Ladies with big feet can only blame themselves. We're all living like lords at father-in-law's. Your children don't know that they're in for. Let your sister show you something. But Mary... You're my sister, but you're damned mean to them. Mary, Mary! - Get me Olsson. - I can't stand it. These weekends are awful. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel like I could do anything just to get away from here. - Don't you? You're so proper. - Dearest Greta. Can you get me a car? I've often thought of your mother wandering around in this cold house. - I was so young when mother died. - How will I make it through dinner? - It's coming? Thanks. - Must you really go? You know I'll do everything for my dearest sister-in-law. - Do you think I'm frumpy? - Not in the least. Who can believe that such a young lady can be the mother of two. The children are my only joy. This time I'll get him right between the horns. - What the devil are you doing? - You're lucky father-in-law's not here. I paid 70.000 crowns for that animal. And they throw stones at it! - No, grandfather. It's just cones. - Be quiet! He's off to bed! - What has happened? - I don't want to see your brats! I won't have them at the dinner table! Send them away! Off to bed with you. Damned kids! Robert! Well! Has father heard that Robert and Ann-Marie Wohlfram are to be engaged? No, you've misunderstood. Robert isn't fond of her. You can't know that. Right? Wohlframs is a very fine family. She was born Countess von Bergk. I don't give a damn about that. But Dr. Wohlfram is a good man. The girl is cute. Robert may marry. - Then I might get some nice grandchildren. - Some cousins would be nice. As long as you and Frans don't produce them. Anyone want some soup? - No. Here's the first Sing "hup fol-de-rol la la la la" Here's the first Sing "hup fol-de-rol la la" He who doesn't drink the first Shall never, ever quench his thirst Here's the first... - Is Robert not here? - No, just two. One young and one old. Karl's not that old. He's Mrs. Asp's nephew. Svante is another nephew. - So they're cousins. - They both want her inheritance. Here's Robert. He can afford to be late. He doesn't need the inheritance... - Having a good time, boys? - Swell. - Your aunt is a splendid aunt. - Not just splendid, but regal... A toast! - Am I the last to arrive? - There's only two as of yet. - How many will there be? - Three. - Then I'm definitely late. - The others came too early. Forgive me, aunt Emma. The best always arrive later in the day. - May I serve? - Yes, please. That was great coffee. - May I? - Thank you. - Would you like some? - No, thanks. Cute girl. - You think she's a virgin? - Absolutely not. - Why such grave accusations? - Sssh. Who is she? Iris... Iris is in the middle of dinner. Who's asking for her? It's urgent. I'm from her neighborhood. Step into the servant's room. But she can only spare a minute. Here's the punch, boys. Come, come, come, Robert dear. - Charming. - That's some punch you have. - This will be tough to drink. - It's not working properly... I've known that since I was a young boy. Don't laugh! Some punch? - Here's to you, dearest aunt. - Thank you. - You're as youthful as ever. - Oh, stop it. - Wow, what a punch. - I stocked up just in time. May I give you a light? - Watch it. - My mistake. - Let's hear some more. - Naturally, my dear. - Did I frighten you? - It's nothing. I spilled some punch on my trouser leg. Can you help me? If the lieutenant would be so kind as to come a little closer. - Please sit down. - Thanks. - Any luck? - I think so. Iris dear.. there's someone... - Oh, forgive me. Forgive me for lending you my leg. - That's all I can do for now. - How can I repay you? - Want to see a movie tomorrow? - I don't think I've got time. Let me give you my card and write down the address. See you there. Ah, biscuits! - Don't you want it back? - Why? Maybe you'll forget your name by the end of the evening. I didn't mean to offend you. Going to the movies isn't unseemly. Thanks for the help...Iris. What are you doing here?! Get away! Get out of here. Leave! - I wrote down the address. - I thought you were joking. - Let's get a cab. - I have to be home at 11. Of course. We can discuss it further later on. Come on. Taxi! So you weren't planning to show up? After dinner young men say the damndest things. - How old are you? - 20. How old are you, lieutenant? - 22. Do you smoke? - I neither smoke or drink. Don't call me lieutenant. My card says ensign. Your name is Ensign? - Very funny, it's Robert... - Iris. - Here's a theatre. - What are they showing? Stop! - Old film. Do you want to go dance? - I don't dance. Should we go to my place? Should we send away the cab? You can always trust a Motander shoe. Buy Motander. We have 184 stores. - Does your father own all the stores? - You can always trust a Motander shoe. - Can you trust a Motander? - Not all, I'm afraid. "Waterloo Bridge" with Robert Taylor. - What do you really think of me? - I don't even know you. I don't know you either. Still... I have such a terrible thirst for romance. If you have the same thirst then... Forgive me... If my adventure and your adventure could become our adventure. - It's cold. We'll have no spring. - No, I suppose not. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this. - Why? - People might make fun of us. - Good night. - Good night. I don't want to see you anymore! Robert! How kind of you to come. - Well... - Sssh! - Do you want a smoke? - If you're having one. You see, Hans told his father... - Do you have matches? He said: "Mom, there's a dumb, nasty old man!" And then Hans said: "April fools." - I heard your voice. How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Have you heard from father? - No. Have you? - Yes, at the factory. He's not happy. - Try to be pleasant. - Robert will have dinner with us at six. - Six is too late. - What is it? - Harald! - Dear Fanny, let him in. Hello! - Greta dear.. good day. - Baltzar, my boy. - Brother! - My dear friends. - Come in. How fun, the parlor! Aren't I nice enough to be let into the bedroom. I suppose it's reserved for nearest relatives. You're out of your mind. - Farewell, Greta. - Do you have somewhere to be? - Yes, I'm afraid I do. - No. A real parlor lieutenant. All he does is play cards. - Bye. - Bye, Robert. See you. - You want a cigar? - Yes, please. Oh, Robert. Ann-Marie Wohlfram's sister sends her greetings. - Thank you. - We talked about you two. - Why are you blushing? - I'm not proposing to her. - No? - Not today at least. Poor Ann-Marie. Robert doesn't care about Ann-Marie Wohlfram. - You think he's lying? - Yes, I do. Watch out! Wait... I haven't got time. Mrs. Asp isn't home. Who should I say has been calling? What was my name again? I remember that your name is Iris. - Give my greetings to Mrs. Asp. - I will. - How are you today? - Fine, thanks. Good to see you again. - Maybe we can go to the movies again? - I would love to. Tonight's perfect. I'll leave my address here. Hello. - I won't wait in vain? - No, I'll be there. Hello. Leave me alone! I can take care of myself. Welcome. - We're going to the movies. - Don't you want to see how I live? Sit down! - How fortunate that you were free. - I cancelled my other engagement. Maybe you're missing out... You think so? - Where were you going? Family? - No. No! If I don't mind being simple then you shouldn't either. You change the subject as soon as we talk about your family. What's wrong with your family? Like old Mrs. Asp... Afraid to die... - Know what you are? Shall I tell you? - Yes, please. You're proud. Let me go. Do you admit it? - Sure I do. You want some wine? - No, thanks. I hate alcohol. My father drank. - Does your father drink? - Only soda water. Is your father alive? Is that your mother? - Is she alive? - No. She looks sweet. - From Greta. Who's that? - My sister-in-law. - How many siblings? - Two. Robert, the youngest. I'll call you my Little One. Don't answer! Ensign Motander. Yes, captain. - You don't seem too happy... - I have nothing to be happy about. Are you lonely? Me too. Shouldn't we comfort each other in our loneliness? - I'm not lonely anymore. Are you? - Yes, I do. A little bit. - What did you think when you came in? - That it seemed terribly warlike. - Did you think we would go to the movies? - Did you? - No. - Me neither. It's here? Thanks! - Tomorrow at 9. Every evening. - Yes. You're not allowed to go with anyone but me. Are you staying? Are we there already? - Robert.. have you been run over? - Look.. he's been bitten. - You've been bitten? - Look another one! Same girl? Use your heels! The ensign will go to the office. The ensign's father is in town. A girl, I take it. - A hooker, of course. - No, she's a good girl. That explains some of your recent transactions. Two pairs of pajamas. Slippers for 44 crowns. Are you insane? You think I've ever had such things? And I've scraped together 12 million. Keep the girls in check. That's what I've done. Duvet for 400 crowns. Can't you keep her warm yourself? - Have you got anything to say? - No, father. I won't tolerate extravagances! I've closed your account. - How much have you given her? - Nothing. Keep it that way. Close the deal with Miss Wohlfram. - You'll have dinner at our place? - No, I'm joining Dr. Wohlfram. Did you get that? Get a ring and propose to the girl. - You wouldn't mind that? - Can you lend me 3000? It'll cost you stocks in the firm. Engagements are expensive things. - What should we engrave? - Can I write it down? - Please. - Thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. Tomorrow I go to Ulricehamn. Then you'll have some time off. If only I could go tonight and miss Oscar's party. - Was old Mrs. Motander as unlikable? - Oh, no she was lovely. - I suppose she loved her children? - Oh, Robert adored her. Time flies. Now Robert's getting engaged. They say he'll announce it tonight. Everything happens so fast. It's so cold. I can feel a draft. My hands are freezing. Feel them. They're like ice. You're cold too. I'm shaking. Thanks, Iris dear. I need something strong. Would you be a dear and get my fur cape too. Can you find it? Where is she? I need my cape. I'm freezing. I'll freeze to death. Where is she? Oh, there she is. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - You mustn't get sick. - It's just a dizzy spell. - Here's your cape. - Thank you. If it wasn't for Robert I'd have gone already. I can't miss this. No. Oscar gets so sore if one doesn't show. Hey. You're late. Sit down. I'm starving. Is it raining? Why don't you take off your coat? - Robert, why are you in the kitchen? - Because I like it there. - We can eat in the bedroom if you like. - Why aren't you at the party? What party? - At your father's place. - Oh, that. I forgot about that. Welcome. He's not coming. Why don't ensign Mannerholm lead Ann-Marie to the table? - They have an eye for each other. - Keep your mouth shut. This is none of your business. Don't you see how awkward this is. - He can't help it if he's been sent away. - How do you know he's been sent away? Of course he's coming. - Who is it? - It's Mrs. Asp. - I don't give a damn about her. I don't give a damn about anyone. Tell them to go home! - Father, they're our guests. - You damn pipsqueak! You think he's been sent away? I will find out. He doesn't want to marry her. But I want him to. - What is it now? - Telephone. From the ensign. I'll take it in the parlor. Hello you scoundrel. Where are you? What? You're not Robert? Who is it then? I don't have any secret friends. - I want you to do me a favor. - Sure thing, uncle. It's the engagement... What is it? - Are you sure you're happy? - What about you? Tomorrow I get to see my Little One in the parade. Know what I'll think? No. That you and I are the only people in the world. Look, there's Uncle Robert! Don't make a scene on the balcony. Do you hear what I say? When will you learn to listen. You're intolerable. What a ridiculous parade. Complete waste of time. - Many people like it. - Oh? Who might they be then? - I'm going to Ulricehamn. - I've been there once with my father. - How is your father? - You would know better than me. That might be. Father is hard to read. Just wait until he gets gored to death by his own bull. Then he won't be such an enigma anymore. - I find the whole thing sickening. - Comical, my friend. Comical. - All of us lack moral fibre. - You think so? I had a teacher.. a gifted man. He said that without God our culture collapses. - Your teacher has got it all wrong... - Are you sure that God doesn't exist? Don't ruminate, Robert. Save it for when you're old and well-fed on the countryside. Religion is for a quiet end to a boisterous life. - Have you found a suitable spouse yet? - No. An unsuitable one then? Who is she? Let your cousin know. - Maybe you don't even know who she is. - What do you mean? Precisely what I'm saying. You don't know who she is. TO ARMS! Are you sure he cares about you the same way I do? Tell me. I think he loves me like you do. - But he's not married. - How can you say such a thing? - Come to the boarding house. - No, there's no point. I love him. He's like a boy. He's so innocent. But you knew everything. You dragged me into this. I know what you are. I'm not afraid of you anymore. - You can go now. - You don't mean that. Don't you realize that you're just his mistress. A hooker. His father doesn't want a hooker in the family. Get out of here! Will my son be participating in the drills tomorrow? Thank you. Then we know what we must do. Are you pleased with the report? - What the devil do you mean? - Precisely what I said. It doesn't matter what you want, it matters what I want. And I'm not pleased with the report. - Father. - You want to dishonor your family! Father! There's a limit to what I'll allow! You have no simple decency! They don't have to shout. What the hell are you two playing at? - Scandals must be shouted down. - What are you talking about... He's not shouting anymore. - Discharged?! - Yes. You've asked to be discharged from your duties as an officer? I'm going to marry the girl, father. It's become clear to me that it's the only right way. My career is therefore irrelevant. - I've gotten... - What? - What? - Something eternal in its place. Nonsense! You'll break off all relations with that girl! She's cheating on you, you know. Go home and find out for yourself. - No one is as innocent as her. - Are you sure about that? - What is this? - Come and drink your tea. I'm leaving, Robert. But first I want you to listen to me. Who is he? You don't know him. I told him that I love you. Then he left. I was their maid. He told me he wanted a divorce. I was 17. - I didn't know better. - Is that all? I was employed by a widow. She had a son who was a nazi. - Thanks. - I want you to know everything. I've wanted to tell you so many times. Now you'll get to hear it. He was a nice boy, but his mother went nuts. I left. Same story. It was a boarding house. I moved again. - There I met another boy. - I don't want to hear any more. Robert, don't be cross. That was you. - Has there been anyone else since? - What do you think? - Do you think I'm a terrible girl? - No, no. You haven't been so chaste yourself. But you haven't experienced much. You tried to come across as a man of the world. But I could tell that you were just a shy little boy. I want you to marry me. No. You think it's wonderful to have a girl in your bed - - but pretty soon you'll want someone else. And then... - Iris, do you smoke? - Yes. - What's this? - I'm going back to Mrs. Asp. - You're out of your mind. - But Robert, what are you doing... You don't have to propose. It's never going to happen. - Yes, it will. - No. You'll see that whenever I call you, you'll be busy. When your father dies you'll be married to a nice girl and have kids. I love you, baby. I don't want to have kids with anyone else. Without you I'll never be completely human. It's like you've given me a soul. I never knew I had one before. I've been like a sheep in a pen. You know I love you, right? Yes. But my Little One doesn't know how long it will last. Put on some coffee... Robert... You were sleeping so peacefully. - You're such a peeping tom. - I have to go. All right! - I was gone just then. - Lay down. - It was nothing. - Sure? - Bye. - Bye. Who has the keys to the apartment? - He has a maid now. - Who's living with him? - I don't know. - Do you know your own name? - How many floors? - Two. - Is this the ensign's apartment? - He's not home, I'm afraid. I know that. - Can I offer you anything? - No, I'm his brother. - You live here? - You'll have to talk to him. Don't give me that tone. I won't stand for it. Are you employed by the month? No. Get your things together. You'll get paid for the month. You see there's been an accident. Robert! It's not too bad is it? Is he injured? Is he dead? - Answer! Is he dead? - Yes. NO! NO! Forgive me, I didn't know this. Don't be sad. I shouldn't have said it. But I'm so... - Baltzar! - There, there, sit down. Try to calm yourself. - Have you seen him? - Yes. - Did Robert suffer? - Not at all. He died instantly. When they ran off the road he hit his head against a rock. I want us all to go to him with some flowers. The kids too. Control yourself. They don't let kids into the morgue. You know that. I have other things to think about. Robert was living with a mistress. I've just been to see her. - They seemed to have celebrated. - Who is she? - Is she young? - Yes, and very cute. She knew he would die. They were too happy, she said. - I brought her here. - Here? Into our home! She's in the spare room. - Why? - It was the only thing I could do. - Robert would never do such a thing. - They lived together, slept together. Are you jealous? I knew you would break. You were in love with Robert! You think you could fool me? - I've known all along! - Baltzar, for heaven's sake! Attention! Present arms! What a pentecost. Yes. It's past eight. I have to go now. Goodbye, Greta. Father... - I'll see you to the door. - Have it your way. Never mention his name in my presence. The lady in the spare room wants to speak to you. Please sit down. I heard there was a wreath with no name. - Yes. - Thank you, that was kind of you. It was for Robert. I wanted to speak to you tonight in case there's no time tomorrow. - I want to thank you. - Well. - I'm leaving tomorrow. - Where to? I'm going back to Mrs. Asp. I hear you've been sick in the mornings. Anything the matter? - I don't know. - Is it possible? - Yes. - What do you plan to do about it? I don't know. - Maybe it's not my brother's? - I can't prove that. - Is is possible? - Don't ask me that. Forgive me, but I have to know. I'll help you. I'll get you a job in one of our shops. - Did my brother give you any money? - No. - Nothing? - No. - But he gave me a ring. - May I see it? Little... Little One. Thanks. I'll take care of Robert's child. - But you can't talk about Robert. - Why not? My wife wouldn't take it very well. Of course. Therefore this has to stay between us. Go to Mrs. Asp. Don't talk about Robert. Those are my terms. And then you'll call me on Wednesday. Not at home but at the factory. The address is Sundbyberg 16 18 32. You'll find it in the directory. Everything turns out for the best in the end. Good night. Farewell. Robert...Robert... Will I never see him again? Not even after this terrible life is over. My maid's sister has died. She went to Växjö. - And then her sister died in childbirth. - Wonderful. - Terrible, I mean. At least it's not contagious. No, not contagious, but sad all the same. Think how many young people have died this year. Robert... - Did you have a good time in Ulricehamn? - Oh yes, the weather was lovely. - It must have been fun. - Oh yes. - I didn't see you at the funeral. - Did you miss me? Thank you. - It was a terrible thing. - Terrible, just terrible. I was shocked when I heard. At least he died immediately. You seem to appreciate Robert more now that he's dead. It's just common decency. I'm sure he was a wastrel. Not at all. Robert was a philosopher. He had a tormented soul. I had dinner with him once and he said... I hope my Little One didn't say anything I don't want to hear. He said that unless we believe in God our culture will collapse.
