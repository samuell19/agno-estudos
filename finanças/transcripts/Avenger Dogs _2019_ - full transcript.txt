(Suspenseful music) - This is it, Catbrain! The time we've waited for all our lives! (Chuckles evilly) - (gasps) Star Frisbee? I love Star Frisbee, Professor McTinkerClaws. - No you don't! Cats don't play frisbee, remember? And you're a cat! - Oh, right. - Cats are cool, casual, aloof, unaffected, understand? - Uh, yup. - Then why don't you start acting like it? I paid 50 space bucks to that baboon space scientist in Nebula 19 just to brainwash you into thinking (stutters) just to help you remember your feline roots after that asteroid chunk hit you on the head and gave you the crazy idea that you were a dog. - Madness! I didn't know what I was thinking, Professor McTinkerClaws. Thank you for helping me see the light. - No worries, Catbrain, no worries. Now, as I was saying, this the hour of our finest victory, the moment we show dogs everywhere what we're made of. With my new mega neutron dimensional destructor, I'll finally wipe out that wretched bone-verse once and for all. - Meow, meow, meow, yes! - And those goofy dogs will realize that without dog snacks, there are no dogs. - Oh, I see. Take away the food, you take away the dog. - Let us focus on the task at hand. Pushing the bone-verse into extinction, wiping out all the bone marrow power, until nothing is left. (Chuckles maniacally) Then and only then, space will belong to the cats, ah! (Upbeat music) - Thanks for returning to headquarters so promptly, you two. - That's our job, Captain Fuzz Face. - Yup, your wish is our command. Uh, your command is our command, we do what you say when you say it. (Woofs) - Point taken, Space Lobber. You can chill out. - It's just that uh, sometimes I'm not clear, Sky Fetcher. I've been trying to be more precise. - I understand what you're saying, Space Lobber, and I thank you for your dedication and vigilance. - Yeah? Uh, sweet! - How can we help you, Captain? Is the kitchen blender jammed again? - Tuna will do that. (Chuckles) We can clear it out, though. And get it working again in no time. - Sure can, we'll head back now and check it out if you like. I can lap up the tuna particles. - Yeah! - No, boys. I'm afraid it's not the blender that's the problem. - Oh no! Is the oven on the fritz again? That's a bummer! Roast turkey jammed again? - We can get on that right away, Captain. - No, it's not the oven either. - Is it the plumbing? 'Cause if it's the plumbing, we can't help you there, Captain. - Nope, I'd say just use the top deck AstroTurf yard and don't forget to have all the dogs curb themselves. - Thanks for the tip, boys. But our issue is far more serious than even that. It seems the source of our universe-wide dog treats is disappearing at an alarming rate. - Oh no! You mean? - The bone-iverse is losing its marrow power. - No! How? - We're not sure. By scientific calculations, just over 17 million tons of galactic bone marrow power has disappeared in less than one light year! - 17 tons? - At that rate, the bone-iverse will be completely barren in slightly less than another light year! - Less than a light year? Oh, but that means outer space will be out of dog treats in our lifetime. - What will we snack on? - There will be lots of spaceships with chewed up holes. - Unless we get to the bottom of things. Identify whoever's responsible and stop 'em in their tracks. - Sounds like a job for-- - The Avenger Dogs! - Oh yeah, you mean you guys, right? - I mean all of us, the Avenger Dogs, as you two are part of the team. - Us? - You can't possibly mean us. We've been kicking back on Planet Kickback at the Paws Up Doggy Spa. Have you ever been, Captain Fuzz Face? - No, I-- - Oh, it's pure heaven. You gotta go! You should come back with us, as we're on our way back after chatting with ya. - Maybe we will, boys, after we save the bone-iverse. - We? You said we. You mean you, right? - No, Sky Fetcher, I mean we. I'm re-deputizing you two effective immediately. - Us? But we're way out of practice. - And way out of shape. - We have issues, hangups, dog anxiety. - Yeah, chew stick traumatic stress is real. - Listen up, boys. You two are my best officers. - That's 'cause all other space officers are away on missions. - Uh, yeah, but you never failed our dog world on a mission. - There's a first time for everything. - That's right. Listen Captain, we're still on the clock at the spa. We just stepped away for a minute to see what was up, but now that we know, we-- - We gotta be getting back right away. - Stat! - I'm sorry, boys. But it's already done. Your ship is tuned up, fueled up and ready to fly. We're all counting on you. (Groaning) Dog speed, Avengers! I know you'll do us proud. - Dog-gone darn. (Upbeat music) - Wow, I can't believe we're back in action, Sky Fetcher. - You and me both, Space Lobber. Where do we even begin? It's been so long since I sat at these controls. - Well to be fair, it hasn't been that long. (Chuckles) It's only been an earth year. - Which is like 15 dog years, and 10,000 anti-matter light years. - Oh, (chuckles) yes. Since you put it that way, time flies like a-- - Don't say that word. - What word? - The F word. - You mean F? - Yes, frisbee. I still have a real issue around round objects. Ever since that frisbee accident in the circular saw nebula. - And everything is round in space, Sky Fetcher. - Tell me about it. Stars, planets, black holes, meteors, round, round, round. (Whines) Yikes! - What about me, Sky? I still haven't gotten over the loss of my thunder shirt on our last mission. Talk about separation anxiety. Sometimes I wake up howling. (Whimpers) - I know. Let's just navigate back to the Paws Up Spa and tell Captain Fuzz Face we couldn't do it. - Really? But we'd be letting the entire dog universe down. We'd fail them completely, right when they needed us most. - You have a point. But do you remember what that steam bath felt like on our coats? (Laughs) - Oh, (chuckles) heavenly. Let's go back. We'll send the Captain a day pass to join us and a vegan cookbook. He'll understand. Bone meal treats are overrated anyway. - Yeah, (chuckles nervously) he'll understand. Oh darn it, we can't. We've got to forge ahead, we've got to follow orders. We are dogs after all. To follow orders is our mission. - It is? But what about the steam bath? What about that carrot cake snacks? - I know, I know. If we can solve the mystery of who's behind this assault on the bone-verse fast enough, we can get back to the spa and finish our session. If we apply ourselves, we can do it. You heard what Captain Fuzz Face said, we're his best officers. At least, the best available ones. (Chuckles) - We've Avenger Dogs! - That's right. And Avenger Dogs never quit, we never rollover, we never play dead. - Nope. So, (chuckles) where do we start? - Hmm, that's a good question. It's been so long since we upheld law and order in the galaxy. I know, let's contact our old informant, Tuff Nut. He knows everything that's going on in the underground. - Tuff Nut? I heard he got into a dog fight in the Rabieson galaxy and it didn't work out too well for him. You think he's still around? - There's only one way to find out. I still have his old number, let's punch it in and see if it works! - [Both] Tuff Nut! - Oh no, what is it now? I thought you two retired. - We did, sorta. - But we're back. - And better than ever. - We are? - Just go with it, Space Lobber. - We're back and better than ever. - Great. To what do I owe the pleasure? - The bone-verse is in great danger, Tuff Nut. - And we're gonna save her. - Oh yeah? And just how do a couple of old mutts like you two plan on doing that? - Wait a second! So you know something about this? - We knew you'd have inside info, Tuff Nut. What's going on? Who's responsible? - Oh, it's bad, guys. Real bad. The bone-verse's source bones were pilfered by a sworn enemy of dog-dom and things are gonna get a whole lot worse before they get better, you dig? - Only when I'm looking for a bone. (Laughs) - What? Uh, nevermind. Tuff Nut, can you tell us who this sworn enemy is? Who are we looking for? Do we know them? - Oh yeah, you know this cat well, real well. But he's got my tongue. If I tell you any more than that, I'm gonna be in real trouble. Everybody knows you dogs don't have my back anymore, you feel me? I gotta look out for number one these days. - Come join us, we'll protect you. - (Scoffs) And what about when your mission's over? Are you gonna drop me off in some star system with no fire hydrants like last time? To fend for myself? - Well. (Chuckles nervously) - You know how tough life gets for a dog without hydrants? Not to mention the elements that hangs out in those planets, mostly inch worms with a bad attitude. - Oh yeah, sounds pretty tough. - All of 'em with eyes and ears to the ground. All of them ready to rat me out. - Inch worms have eyes and ears? - He means metaphorically, Slob. - Yeah, you try it, folks. It ain't fun. You dogs could've at least put me in witness protection, given me a new canine identity, but no. Well no more, Tuff Nut's not your Huckleberry. - Tuff Nut, please. The survival of every dog in outer space is at stake. - That means you too, buddy. - Me too? (Scoffs) I don't think so. I won a sweepstakes and can eat free for life at McComets. - Free for life? Wow! - But, McComets? Is that good for you? - Free is good enough. I don't gotta rely on the bone-verse or any dog ever again. I'm in business for me, just the way I like it. - Oh, I see. - You better. And I'd act fast, y'all, else you might lose a lot more than those tasty treats. Peace out. (Computer beeps) - Oh, that doesn't sound good. - No, it doesn't. Come on, if Tuff Nut won't help us, we gotta find who's responsible for this, this thievery before they find us first! - Well, well, well, if it isn't my old nemesis, Captain Fuzz Face. You're ugly as ever, I see. - I could say the same for you, McTinkerClaws. To what do I owe this call, you maniacal meower? - I wanted to save you from all the time and the trouble of organizing your forces to come and look for me. - Oh? And why would we be looking for you? It's been a joy to have you out of sight and out of mind. - You'd be looking for me because I'm the one responsible for the crisis in your precious bone-verse, that's why. - You? I should've known! - Ah, ha! But you didn't, did you? Just like a dog, so trusting and oblivious. (Laughs) You have no clue as to the true devious nature of cats. - Well, dogs are good-hearted creatures. What can we do? - Good-hearted extinct creatures, Captain. History is littered with the bones of kind animals who weren't tough enough to cut it. (Laughs) Now you will soon join them. - You won't succeed, McTinkerClaws. Just like you haven't succeeded in any of your other threats to our universe's safety and wellbeing. Puppy love is stronger than feline hate. - Sound bites and slogans won't save you, Captain. It's the end of the line for you dogs and for all the snacks you love to eat. For ages I've been looking forward to a universe built on catnip. (Laughs) And at last, the dawn of a grand new era is upon us. - Bring it on, feline. Just as your villainy knows no bounds, neither does our righteousness. We'll turn all your efforts back, just like we've turned them back before. - Sounds fun, game on. See you soon, lap dog. You can count on it. - Game on, cat! Birdbutt, we need to talk. - Oh, is it about the chair legs in the lounge? I'll have you know I was not the one who chewed them up, Captain. - The chair legs? What? No, it's not about the chair legs. - Ah, phew. - Are the chair legs damaged? - Well, the good thing is, dogs don't mind eating on the floor. So chairs with no legs are alright. - I see, I'll call maintenance then. - What did you need to see me about, Captain? - McTinkerClaws is back and he's robbing the bone-iverse of all its marrow power! - He's stealing the marrow power? But that means-- - I'm afraid so. No more dog treats, ever! (Birdbutt gasps) - This puts our very lives at risk. We won't be able to sustain ourselves in outer space without the nutrient rich dog treats from the bone-verse. Leg chairs are a great in between meals treat, but they're not a meal in themselves. - Right, that's why I've dispatched my former best officers, Sky Fetcher and Space Lobber, to stop this despicable plot before it goes too far! - Oh good, can I go now? I heard there's a couple of unchewed chairs in Area 41. - No, you can't go, Birdbutt. We have a problem. I fear that Sky Fetcher and Space Lobber are not up to the task this time. - Ah, drag. - Yes, it's a drag indeed. It's a super drag. - If I may ask, Captain, what is their problem? Is it digestion issues again? - No, no, nothing like that. It's all mental. Their heads are in the stars. Sky and Space are out of shape and racked with hangups, insecurities and phobias. - Perhaps they should return to the dojo for intensive retraining. - Yes, perhaps. You think you can whip those dogs into fighting shape, Birdbutt? - Leave it to Birdbutt, Captain. (Rock music) - I'm having flashbacks, Space Lobber. All the round planets are making me nervous. All I can think about is frisbees. - At least you came out of it in one piece. Only a small bump on the noggin. I never did find my thundershirt. Every time I spot a meteor shower, or an asteroid field, I get the cold sweats. - Ain't we a pair? How in the universe are we ever gonna get to the bottom of this assault on the bone-verse? We can't even think straight. (Computer beeps) - Sky Fetcher! Space Lobber! I have some bad news. - Worse than what we've already heard? - I'm afraid so. McTinkerClaws is back. - [Both] McTinkerClaws? - Yes, McTinkerClaws! And he's the perpetrator of the assault on the bone-iverse. - We should've known. - Yes, you probably should have. - You agreed kinda fast there, Captain. - I need you two dogs to report to the planet Chewy dojo at once! - Planet Chewy? Oh, but we completed our Avenger Dog training eons ago. - Yeah, we're pros, seasoned pups, the best of the best. (Whimpers) Was that a frisbee? Did I just see a frisbee? - Don't quibble with me, boys. Just do it! Sensei Birdbutt is awaiting your arrival. - Sensei Birdbutt? Oh, but his training is too tough. We just barely got enough spa time for this. - Avenger Dogs must be in top shape at all time. Now it's time to sharpen your instincts and hone your skills. - But Captain, we-- - That's an order, Sky Fetcher. - Sir. - Yes, sir. We're not gonna be able to bark and howl our way through this one, Space Lobber. - No, Sensei Birdbutt it is. (Rock music) (calming music) - Space Lobber, Sky Fetcher, welcome back to planet Chewy. I trust your journey into our atmosphere was comfortable. - It could've been a little smoother, Sensei. - Nothing worth having comes easy, officer. We must work hard, then harder. For ever victory we earn, big or small, there are no shortcuts in the universe. - Actually, I know a couple. - That's right, the black hole in Nebula Seven leads directly into the fourth dimension and at the Paws Up Doggy Spa. - That is not necessarily what I was speaking of, Space Lobber. - Oh, well if you ever need to get to the fourth dimension and a really great spa real quick, there you go. - Tell me, Sky Fetcher. - Uh oh. - Do you still harbor anxiety at the sight of circular objects like frisbees? - Uh, (stuttering) no, not really. I mean, I'm okay flying through the galaxy if that's what you mean. (Chuckles nervously) I can't take it, I have flashbacks every time I see a planet, Sensei, and planets are everywhere. I can't even look at the buttons on our dashboard without breaking into a sweat. They're round! - So much for keeping our cool. - I see. What about you, Space Lobber? Have you ever overcome the loss of your beloved thundershirt? - (Scoffs) A long time ago. Who needs a thundershirt when we have solid partners like you guys? (Chuckles nervously) (whimpering) I do! I miss it so much, Sensei! I'm cold all the time! (Whimpering) I shake uncontrollably. I miss the way it held me tight (inhales sharply) through asteroid showers and flash storms. I felt so secure. (Sobbing) I felt invincible. Now I just feel, (gasping) I just feel like a naked dog. (Sobbing) - Now we're getting somewhere. You boys are suffering what is known as a dog block. - Well all I know is we didn't suffer any dog blocks back at the Paws Up Doggy Spa. - Uh, nope, everything was just fine at the spa, Sensei. - That comfort zone is a beautiful place, boys, but nothing ever grows there. - Yeah, is that like a motivational thing or what is? - Yup, he's trying to get in our heads. You know he does. - Right, right, right, right. - To rebuild confidence, one must first break down the faulty supports that have been built. - Uh, (sputters) so, we're gonna do construction? - I'm uh, lousy at manual labor. (Chuckles nervously) I'll just throw that out there. - Not as lousy as me, Sky. - We are going to access the recesses of your pooch minds to strengthen your pup seikis and bolster your canine mental defenses. - That sounds like hacking, and hacking's illegal. Even in space. - I'd like to leave the recesses of my pooch mind alone, thanks. - Close your eyes, officers, and repeat after me. I am the master of my own destiny. The keeper of my own bone. - That's kinda weird. - Totally weird. - Can we just uh, listen to some jams or something? - Yeah, maybe practice some yoga poses. - My down dog is strong. - Oh, (laughs) wait till you see my happy puppy. - Focus, boys, focus! (Suspenseful music) - Look at that, Catbrain, the elusive, mystical, magical bone-verse. A few creatures who don't count themselves among the canines have ever seen this dimension. - I've never seen this dimension, Mr. McTinkerClaws. And I'm a, no wait, I'm a cat. - That's right, Catbrain. You're a cat. Now repeat after me, meow. - Meow. - Very good. Now then, activate our new laser, the submolecular bone breaker, and let's crush these bones down to fine powder and collect their dust. Once I run the fine powder through my bone conversion transformer, it will emerge as the finest substance known to the universe. (Laughs maniacally) - You mean marrow meal? - No, you twit, catnip. It'll be catnip! And the universal balance of power will shift forevermore. Never again will smelly dogs lay claim to that silly man's best friend moniker. Cats will become the unchallenged number one domestic animal in all existence. And I will be recognized as the greatest cat of all time. - What about me, McTinkerClaws? Will I be known as a great cat? Will I be famous? - You? Oh, you! Oh, you'll be known as a footnote in my glorious legacy, Catbrain. - Oh, is that good? - Sure, it's perfect for the likes of you. On the bright side, your delusional brain will surely be studied by medical students for light years to come. - Oh cool, I mean, meow. - Now, well let's cut out the meowing and get down to business. I want every one of these bones we see crushed, collected and converted immediately. - [Catbrain] Yes sir, Professor McTinkerClaws. Right away, sir. (Dramatic music) - How are the Avenger Dogs progressing, Birdbutt? Any breakthroughs in their psychosis? - Not at all, Captain. They're fearing far worse than I'd hoped. They both harbor deep seeded insecurities about their past traumatic puppy experiences that will undoubtedly hamper their ability to think and behave rationally in the field. I'd say our chances of saving the bone-verse with those two are slim to none. - Can we skew towards slim? I prefer not to speak in absolutes in times of combat. - Ah, alright. Our chances of saving the bone-verse with Sky Fetcher and Space Lobber is very, very, very, extraordinarily slim. I mean, slim with a capital S, L, I, and M. - Great so we have a shot then. - If that's how you care to look at it, fine Captain. - I do and unfortunately, this leaves us with only one course of action. - You mean we're going to call in the sage legend, Ram Dalmatian? - No, Birdbutt, we're going to toughen Sky Fetcher and Space Lobber up. We're going to rekindle their fire, sharpen their claws, harden their fangs, get me Butterball! - Butterball? But he's a wild card, unpredictable, uncontrollable. We're not even sure what side of the moon that lunatic's on from one moment to the next. - Exactly, Sensei, and he's our only hope. We're going to reteach these dogs how to fight and fight to win. (Upbeat music) (Space Lobber sighs) - This is hopeless, Sky. We aren't in the right frame of mind to be working. I couldn't focus on a single thing Sensei Birdbutt was saying. This is a disaster. What are we gonna do? - We need to pull ourselves together, Space Lobber. We need to toughen up. - You think McTinkerClaws will just roll over and let us stop him? - If we're ferocious enough, sure. Lots of real loud barking will make him think twice about crossing us space dogs. - What if cosmic animal control spots us and mistakes us for being rabid? - We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. - Sounds like a plan. Can we work the bridge while we're at it, Sky? - Sky Fetcher, Space Lobber. - That's us, Chief. - Highly trained and ready for anything. Always. - No matter what else you've heard. - Or haven't heard. - I want you two to report back to headquarters at once! - At once? So you mean like, right now? - That's exactly what I mean. I need all of your eight paws on deck for an emergency Avenger Dog meeting. The landing dock is cleared for you. There's no time to waste. Warp speed immediately! - An emergency meeting? We've never been called to an emergency meeting before. - I know. It could only mean one thing. - That we're being rewarded? - No, that we're being fired. - Fired? Does that mean we get to go back to the spa? (Dramatic music) - Well, you actually came. I half expected you two to run or something. - We thought about it, Captain. That spa is open 24 hours. - But we decided it was better to come in and face the music. - You're here because I want to send you through another phase of retraining. When the survival of canines throughout space depends on it, you can never undergo too much training, boys. - Captain, with all due respect, if you don't think we're cut out for this anymore, just say so. - Please don't fire us. We love this job, we were born to be Avenger Dogs. - That's the spirit, boys. Report to the bridge at once. Drill Sergeant Butterball's waiting. - Alrighty, play time's over, recruits. Eyes straight ahead, tails up, ears at attention. You can call me Butterball. - Oh, boy, here we go! - You said what? - He was just clearing his throat, sir. - (Coughing) Doggy hair ball. - That lump in your throat's not a hairball, it's fear. And fear's got no place here, understand? - [Both] Sir, yes, sir. - If you taste fear, you will chew it up, spit it out, and ask for another helping. You hear me? - Sir, yes, sir. - Uh, I don't know if I can do this. - If you can do this? You can and you will, dogface. That's an order! - Well at least he didn't call me catface. - Drop down to dog position and start stretching those muscles. It's time to get in shape and become the car chasing, hydrant marking, mailman biting warriors you were always meant to be. This is it, you lazy sofa jockeys. Unleash the beast within! - Hurrah! - Oh, boy. - Are you dogs hard of hearing? I said drop and give me 20! Now it's 30! You want to go for 40? - Sir, no, sir! - No, sir! (Dramatic music) - Ah, there's nothing like the delightful fragrance of pure catnip, Catbrain. If they made anything better, they surely kept it for themselves. - They? Who's they, Professor McTinkerClaws? - You know, they. - I uh, I really don't know, that's why I'm asking. - They, (groans) the they who control things you know, behind the scenes. - Oh, like puppet masters? - Yes, like puppet masters. - Who are they exactly? - Well, that's just it, Catbrain. They wouldn't be they if we knew who they were. They can't be revealed or else they wouldn't be they anymore. - I get it, and they wouldn't be able to pull the strings. - Exactly. They couldn't pull the strings if they too were in the spotlight. Then they'd be puppets and not puppet masters. - Gotcha, thanks for clearing that up. - No worries, Catbrain. One thing I can tell you for sure about they though, they are cats. (Laughs maniacally) That's a fact. - Woof! Oops! - What was that? - What was what? - What you just did there. Was that barking? - Barking? Hah, I don't bark, I'm a cat, meow. - A cat with personality problems. A cat in an identity crisis. - What? Me? No, don't be silly. - I'm not being silly. I'm being serious, I brainwashed you. I know you better than anyone. - Brainwashed me? What do you mean, brainwashed me? - Huh? Oh, nothing, nothing. I meant I found you. - Found and brainwashed are two tough words to mix up, Professor McTinkerClaws. - It's the catnip going right to my head. Too delightful to think straight. I'll forget about it. - What should we do next, sir? - Hm, we'll do what we always do when we have a little down time. Bully the dogs. - Fun, woof! Uh, maybe it's indigestion. - Must be that. Full steam ahead, Catbrain. Find us some dogs to terrorize. (Whooshing) (dramatic music) - You boys look beat. Butterball, tell me, how'd these Avenger Dogs fair? - They are without a doubt, the single worst duo I've ever had the displeasure of trying to wrangle. Captain Fuzz Face, genuinely inept. - Did he say adept? - No, Space Lobber. He said inept. - Oh. That's not good, right? - Nope. - Them two dogs ought to be reassigned to kennel duty, stat. And by kennel duty, I mean cleaning the kennels. They simply don't possess the confidence necessary to wear the Avenger badge, Captain. - I see. So on a scale of zero to 10, Drill Sergeant, would you-- - Minus 20. - Yikes. We created our own end of the sale. That's gotta count for something. - Yeah, it counts us as the biggest screw ups the Avenger Dog unit's ever seen. - Oh, hm. - Thank you for your professional opinion, Sergeant Butterball. I'll take it into advisement as we prepare to redeploy this team. - Redeploy? Captain, you're not really considering redeployment of those two, are you? - I am! - Hey, did you hear that? We're not getting fired! - Goodbye dog spa. - I beg to differ. These dogs are not ready for a mission of such magnitude. - Hey, (stutters) maybe Butterball is right. We should give it a few more days. Eat well, rest up, we'll be back better than ever, Captain. - Nonsense, Space Lobber. Our bone-iverse is in danger right this very moment. Our bone marrow power density calculator indicates that the fourth dimension has lost another 436 million grams of bone meal since last time we talked. Our galactic food source is being stolen out from under us by the nanosecond. We must act now, lest we lose everything. Our very survival's at stake. - (Laughs) You said steak. I could eat, is it dinnertime yet? - I've heard enough of this. I did my part and that's all I can do. I'm out of here. - He doesn't have a lot of faith in us, Captain. - I don't know how much faith I have in us either. - Boys, all that matters is that you're willing to give it another go. We all make mistakes and we all fail, even the winners. - They do? - Yes, they do. The important thing is that you pick yourselves up, dust yourselves off, put your ears to the wind, and your tongue over your shoulders and charge back into the fire. - Fire? Uh, ow. - It's a figure of speech, Space Lobber. What I mean is we all fall down sometimes. It's those who get back up that win the race. - We're gonna race? But cats are fast! You really think we can beat McTinkerClaws, Captain? - Alright, no sense in resisting. The bone-verse needs us, Slob. We'll do our best, Captain. We know what's on the line and we appreciate the second chance. - Technically it is our third chance. - Whatever. We're all in, sir. - Thank you, boys. With your experience and your track record, you're our best hope. Prepare for redeployment momentarily. (Suspenseful music) - Well that went well. - Did it? I think everybody we talked to lost all confidence in us completely. - Everyone except Captain Fuzz Face, and his word is the word that matters. - So, what do we do now? - I've been thinking about that. We have to hook back up with Tuff Nut. - Tuff Nut? He doesn't believe in us either. - It doesn't matter. He knows the cosmic underbelly like no other dog out there. - He is a dachshund after all. - He can lead us right to McTinkerClaws, we need him. - But Sky, Tuff Nut moves around a lot. He's slippery. There's no telling where he'll be from one nanosecond to the next. And if Tuff Nut doesn't want to be found, we'll never find him. We can't just snap our paws and make him appear. - Sure we can. - Oh yeah? How? - [Tuff Nut] Mm, those bacon balls sure were tasty, you guys. Where'd you get 'em? - We made 'em, Tuff Nut. From our own home-cooked Avenger recipe. - Well, thanks for leaving a trail of them out in space. It's a good thing I found it. - You can say that again. - Yeah, but why would I? I was clear the first time. If you didn't get it, that's on you, you dig? - Uh. Uh, okay. - But listen, that bacon ball recipe's something else. You dogs might have a future on your paws after this whole space police thing is over. - Oh yeah, you think so? - I'd buy a bag of bacon balls all day long. But of course, I won't have to. As your close ally and confidant, I would get free bacon balls. Right? - That's right, buddy. But just between us, the secret ingredient of our bacon balls is in short supply. All this intergalactic theft is making it tougher to make them. Pretty soon, our bacon balls may be a thing of the past. - What? But I just ate my first ones and now I'm hooked. What can I do to help? - First things first, we gotta stop McTinkerClaws from raiding the bone-verse and taking all our bone marrow power. - We save the bone-verse, we save the bacon balls. Get it? - Yeah, I get it. I guess I can help you dogs. But strictly on the down low, you hear? I'm getting a reputation around this galaxy as a tattletale and I don't like it. - You're just getting that reputation now? You've been a tattletale as long as we've known you, Tuff Nut. - Hey, you know, I don't appreciate that. - He didn't mean to offend you, Tuff Nut. - Well, I did, (laughs) kinda. - I'll have you know, my image didn't take a hit until I started doing business with the likes of you two. So, if I got a bad reputation, you're to blame. - Us? Nobody every twisted your tail to be a part our last mission. - No? What about that time on planet Toot-toot when you guys were looking for Wet Snot the Setter and I was trying to finish my beef jerky treat in peace. - Oh, (chuckles nervously) that. - Yeah, that. You both pinned me down and twisted my tail 'til I gave him up. - That was a special case. He had a suitcase nuke and was about to wipe Mars out of the solar system. - Yeah, well, my beef jerky fell down the storm drain and you never did buy me another one. - Tuff Nut, if you want another beef jerky, we'll get you one. - No kidding, for reals? - For reals. Let's stop McTinkerClaws first. Then you can have all the beef jerky you want. - Well, that's a tiger of a different stipe, pal. All the beef jerky I want, huh? - Within reason. - Which is it now? A beef jerky, or all the beef jerky? Let's iron this thing out, guys. Or I ain't sayin' another word. - A few beef jerky strips, a few? We'll get you a bag, how's that sound? - A large bag. - [Sky Fetcher] Okay, okay, a large bag. - I mean like, not like a trash bag or anything. - Let's stick to the matter at hand, you guys. Which way do we go, Tuff Nut? - For beef jerky or McTinkerClaws? - For the cat! Which way for the cat? - Okay, I don't know. - You don't know? He doesn't know! - Hey, I never said I did, capisce? But I got a friend on planet Evergreen you should meet. She's a very smart and courageous pup. - Planet Evergreen it is, hang on! (Upbeat music) (whooshing) - [McTinkerClaws] Well hello again. Why the long face, Captain? (Laughs maniacally) - Is that supposed to be funny, you over-hyped mouse catcher? - Funny? Why, no. It's supposed to be factual. Your snout makes you look like nothing more than an upholstered vacuum cleaner. And as for me being over-hyped, believe the hype. This star system will soon bear my name. Forget the milky way, mutt. McTinkerClaws Way is the way of the future! (Laughs maniacally) Very soon you'll all be obsolete. Prepare for oblivion. (Laughs maniacally) (dramatic music) - Thank you for seeing us on such short notice, Eugenia. I'd like you to meet my uh-- - Your friends? - What? No! Gosh, no! - Yeah, friends? (Laughs) No. - We're more like, business partners. - (Scoffs) Not even. Like, business associates. - Even that's being generous. I just know these two. Like, I know their names. I can't even tell you a good thing about 'em, really. - Forgive me for asking, but if none of you are friends, why have you come to see me at my home? I don't quarrel here. - Oh, me and this guy are friends. This is Space Lobber, he's my right hand pup. - Totally. I love this dog. Sky Fetcher's my brother from another litter. (Laughs) - No doubt. It's just this Tuff Nut dude who's sketchy. He just helps us out sometimes. - But usually he's just a pain. - A super pain. - Positivity. I want to hear positivity from you dogs. Only good dogs are admitted here. - He's not without his good points. - He's kinda witty. - Eugenia, we're here because the bone-verse is in trouble. - I'm aware. - We got off on the wrong foot, Eugenia. Allow me to reintroduce us. I'm Sky Fetcher. - And I'm Space Lobber. - And we're with the Avenger Dogs. - Star hopping, comet chasing, villain vanquishing action dogs. - You boys work for Captain Fuzz Face? - [Officers] Yes! - He promised me a box of treats for my birthday. He's been ducking me for two light years now. - Really? That doesn't sound like our Captain at all. - No, it doesn't. He always remembers birthdays. - Hm, fine, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I expect those treats or else I'm gonna be very angry at him. - Oh alright, Eugenia, we'll let him know. - You'd better. I never forget names or faces. Now, what do you need me for? - Uh, we know who's responsible for the attacks on the bone-verse, Professor McTinkerClaws, but we don't know where to find him. - Tuff Nut said you might be able to help us. - Boys, the answer to your questions lies within your own hearts. - (Gasps) Within our own hearts? You mean we have heart worms? Oh no, those can be deadly! We need to seek medical help right away! How long do we have, Eugenia? Tell us! (Sobbing) How long? - Slob, calm down, we don't have heart worms. - But (stuttering) she just said that-- - Listen to everything I say to you, Space Lobber, and all answers will be revealed. When faced with a feline assailant, one must realize that answers can be unlocked like a puzzle and you need only look inside for the key. - Oh, so that's what microchips are for, huh. - Eugenia, we know McTinkerClaws is the one who's trying to hurt us, but we don't know how he possibly gained access to the bone-verse. - Yeah, you have to be a canine to get in. - Unless he has help. That cat could be in cahoots with a dog gone bad. - A bad dog? But who in the universe would be bad enough to team up with McTinkerClaws, of all cats? (Dramatic music) - What a master stroke, Professor McTinkerClaws, you sure know how to make a paw print. - That I do, Catbrain, that I do. Did you see Captain Fuzz Face's fuzzy face when I told him? - (Laughs) Yeah, it sure was a sight to behold. - I sure shocked the shed out of him, alright? Now that he knows what he's up against, he just might surrender before this gets really ugly. - He will if he knows what's good for him, Professor McTinkerClaws. - That's right. Now, before we scrap every last bit of marrow power from the bone-verse and pick it clean, let's eat! Route us to Space Jacks, pronto. I want a number four with supersized sides of sardines and a milk and anchovy space drink! - Alright, I'm lettin' you dogs know up front that this is a real special deal you got here. - You say every deal's a special deal when you're involved, Tuff Nut. - Yeah well, this one's super special. Eugenia doesn't leave her castle on high for just anybody. - Thanks, Eugenia. - Don't mention it, boys. I'm a dog too, after all. I just can't sit by in clear conscience and watch as McTinkerClaws runs rough shot through the great bone-iverse. - Well it's nice to have you aboard, ma'am. We're honored. - That's more like it. See, wasn't so hard, was it? A little more respect out of you two would be a nice change of pace. - Don't hold your breath, Tuff Nut. - Tuff Nut, sir, let's try that. - I'm having flashbacks to Butterball's basic training. - I know, right? (Laughing) - Boys, I want you know that I am able to protect you from enemy fire with the strength of the mighty universal ear perk for up to five hundred kilometers. Anything after that, you must defend yourselves. - [Officers] Thanks, Eugenia. - Uh, what's the mighty universal ear perk? - It is the strongest and purest force field known to outer space, activated by the pup mind. - Whoa, like a dog trick? - No, lunkhead, not like a dog trick. Eugenia's the real deal. - Oh yeah? - Just remember boys, even though you're shielded by the mighty universal ear perk, the best offense is always a good defense. Avoid conflict if you can, fight hard if you must. Resort to the ear perk, only if all other options have failed. - Don't you worry, Eugenia. We'll fight hard, alright. If I get my teeth around that cat's tail, you'll have to pry me off. (Chuckles) Hey, speaking of bites, is anyone else hungry? - I could eat, what do you have in mind, Slob? - Wanna swing by Space Jacks for a bag of star nuggets? - Mm, I could go for some steaming star nuggets. But what about the bone-verse? It's depleting by the nanosecond. Do we have time? - Alas, time is relative. Some dog on a distant planet is sitting in the shade right now because another being planted a tree long, long ago. - Wow. That's deep. - I told you she was amazing. - Also, if you're going to Space Jacks, get me a number two special. Oh, oh, with sriracha sauce. - Will do, Eugenia. Space Jacks here we come! (Space Lobber howls) (whooshing) - Professor McTinkerClaws, radar is picking up a space vessel at a half light year out and closing fast. - A vessel? Who is it? Are they armed? - Looks like it's a canine ship, sir. - Canines? Oh, well they must be headed to Space Jacks too. Activate our invisible shield, Catbrain. We'll surprise those bone-chasers at the fly through. They think they're going to grab a quick bite, but it's us who will be getting a bite (laughs maniacally) of their behinds! - [Sky Fetcher] Okay, listen up. Does everybody have their orders ready? - I'll take a 10 piece, no make it two 10 pieces. - Make that three! And a large fries with sea salt. - [Tuff Nut] And a chocolate milkshake. - Tuff Nut, you're a dog! You're not supposed to have chocolate. - Oh, yeah, make that vanilla. - I'll make it four. Vanilla shakes for everyone! (Space Lobber howls) - Surprise! (Laughs maniacally) Is somebody hungry? - What? Where'd he come from? - Doesn't matter. All that matters is we found him! Now we can stop him. - You sound awfully sure of yourselves, dogs. Wanna try me? - Don't mind if we do, McTinkerClaws. - Sky Fetcher, remember what I said about the mighty universal ear perk. - Gotcha. So, we're protected, right? - Hit us with your best shot, hairball. - Don't mind if I do. Take this! (Guns firing) - Hey, that was a direct hit! What about that mighty ear perk, Eugenia? - One of the basic tenants of the ear perk is that you mustn't initiate aggression. - In other words, if you pick a fight, you're downtown without a leash, pal. - We didn't pick the fight. He's been robbing the bone-verse blind. He's trying to starve us out of space. He just ambushed us out of nowhere. What do you think he wants to do, play frisbee? - Oh no, a frisbee. - Breathe, Sky, breathe. - Why the pouty snouts? Is something the matter, dogs? Finally realized that you've met your match, hmm? - Never, you won't get away with this, cat! Space Lobber, warm up our boomerang lasers. If it's a fight this jerk wants, it's a fight he'll get. - Oh, goodie. I love a good scrap. (Guns firing) (explosion booming) - [Catbrain] They're fighting back, sir! Our left thrusters have been disabled. - What? Nobody fights back against McTinkerClaws, no body! It's time to play our trump card, Catbrain. Look scared! - I am scared! - Even better. Hold still, you're on camera in three, two, one. - Tinkaroo, what are you doing with McTinkerClaws? - Are you okay? He hasn't hurt you, has he? - Tinkaroo? Who's Tinkaroo? - It's you, you're Tinkaroo! - Oh, I am? I thought my name was Catbrain. - No, you're Tinkaroo! And you're a dog. - Oh, wow! I mean, oh bow-wow! Professor McTinkerClaws says if I don't behave, he will give me clean odorless slippers to chew. Ew! - Clean slippers? (Groans) The monster! What's the joy of chewing anything that doesn't stink? - (Gasps) Torture! - I know, right? - Tinkaroo, you hang in there! We won't let McTinkerClaws get away with this. - [McTinkerClaws] I already have! - No matter what happens to the bone-verse, Tinkaroo, we'll bring you home safe and sound. That's a promise! - Tell them how scared you are. Tug at their heart strings. - Please, guys, I'm so scared of those clean slippers, yuck! - Stay strong, Tink. We won't forget about you. - That's right! This fight's only just begun. - Says you, fleabag. I say it's over, and the feline side wins. (Laughs maniacally) - Oh, please, please don't give me those scent free slippers to chew on, mighty Professor McTinkerClaws, they will surely leave my mouth dry, my tail wagless and my heart empty. - Wow, that's beautiful canine haiku. - (Laughs) You shall all cower beneath my fearsome and legendary silhouette. Warp speed ahead, my victorious destiny awaits! I said warp speed, this isn't warp speed! We're basically crawling. - [Catbrain] Our left thruster's disabled, remember? This is all the warp we've got left. - [McTinkerClaws] Well, press the throttle, fly a figure eight or something. Let's hide behind a meteor. I left them with such an emphatic statement. Creeping away like this is so anti-climatic. - [Catbrain] Yes, sir, Professor McTinkerClaws. (Whooshing) - Blast, this is worse than we thought. McTinkerClaws has a hostage and it's Tinkaroo! What in the universe are we gonna do now? - Uh, one thing's for sure, this is a game-changer. We need to return to headquarters right away. Captain Fuzz Face has to know about this before we make another move. - Oh, lovely. I can confront your captain in person and get my birthday gift. He'll hear about this. - It might be better if we drop you off, Eugenia. - Have it your way. The mighty universal ear perk goes with me. - Well, it's not like it did us much good this time. (Eugenia groans) - Uh, guys, what about Space Jacks? - Forget Space Jacks, Tuff Nut, this is serious! - So is dinner, can we just grab it to go? - [Officers] No! (Dramatic music) - Doctor Henbrain, we hear you have something to tell us. - Indeed I do, officers! I'll cut right to the chase. Are either of you familiar with the mega neutron dimensional destructor? - The what? - Say no more. This is the weapon currently being used by the cat called McTinkerClaws, to pilfer precious bone marrow power from our bone-iverse. It's reverse redactor function allows him to cull 10 times the marrow power that we can collect with our paws alone in a fraction of the time. - We know, the galactic marrow power's almost gone! The bone-verse is practically a grave yard. - Aye, and it will be unless we can disable his infernal device. - How in the stars can we do that? I've already forgotten what the thing's called. - Come on, Space Lobber. It's the mega sonic dimensional didactic! - Wait, wait, (stutters) no, it was the megatronic dimension discipliner. Right, doctor? - You're both completely wrong. - [Officers] Oh. - It's the mega neutron dimensional destructor. - That's what I said. - No, that's what I said. - Neither of you said it, but that's neither here nor there. The good news is I've devised a way to stop it. - You have? Tell us! - There's no time for demonstration, sadly. We must act and act fast if we want to save our bone-iverse. - We're ready, what do we do, doctor? - See Lieutenant Rufflebuns, he'll lead you through the next steps. - You mean like, an obstacle course? I need to stretch first if we're gonna get physical. - Space Lobber. - What? - You're not cramped? We've been scrunched up in that space ship for so long. I love coming back to headquarters just to stretch my legs. - If it's stretching you want, I don't think you boys will be disappointed. See Lieutenant Rufflebuns, you dolts. He'll instruct you on what to do next. - [Officers] Okay. - [Sky Fetcher] Lieutenant Rufflebuns! Doctor Henbrain said you-- - Whatever that pooch said, don't believe it. Henbrain's out of his canine mind. All that time in the laboratory by himself has made him cuckoo, loco, bonkers! - But he's a brilliant doctor! It comes with the territory. He's always been a little bit eccentric. - Yes, well, he talks to test tubes now and they talk back. - They do? - Mm-hm. In all kinds of voices. - Oh, (laughs) yeah, that's batty. - Nutty as a squirrel. - Anyway, forget it. If this whole thing works out, you won't have to deal directly with Doctor Henbrain anymore, understand? - If what whole thing works out, Lieutenant? - Go see Officer McAdoo in her quarters. She'll explain everything! (Dramatic music) - There's no time to mince words, boys! I need to take both your measurements, immediately! We're gonna fit you for a new top secret garment. - Oh, we're getting new outfits? - (Gasps) Are they thundershirts? I'd love a new thundershirt. - I can't tell you anymore right now. This operation is top secret. It's our last chance to save the bone-verse and if it fails. - Are you just gonna leave us hanging? What happens if it fails? What happens? - Space Lobber, calm down. - But I need to know the hard truth. - I'll give you the hard truth, mutts. The bone-verse is gone forever, and so are we! - Oh, yeah, that's some heavy stuff right there. (Whimpers) Sorry I asked. - Yeah, me too. - You really think now's the time to be trying on new outfits, McAdoo? Shouldn't we be planning a counter attack, or something? - Sometimes I don't know how you made it this far, mutts. I really don't. Alright, come on, we need to see if these suits fit. - Oh, maybe they'll fit us with sweet tuxes like double O canine? - We'll be totally cool! (Upbeat music) - Ah, there you are! How do they fit, boys? - Uh, how do they fit? I feel vacuum packed. - I'll say! Tight squeeze is an understatement. What are we doing in these get ups, Captain? - What we've been doing all along, boys! Saving the bone-iverse! - Wait, you're not expecting us to moonwalk, right? - If that's what it takes, Space Lobber, yes. You're Avenger Dogs, you never quit, never tire, never rollover. - Never take a deep breath, apparently. - Hey, speaking of deep breathes, what if one of these skin tight suits splits a seam, Captain? - Yeah, I had beef stroganoff at dinner last night and I feel a little gassy. - Checking if a little gas is okay, Captain. - Yeah, making sure we all ask the right questions, Captain, given the universe is at stake. - Yeah. - You two know anything about zero gravity implosion? - Uh, about what? - I think he means beef stroganoff for dinner was not a good idea, Slob. - Those space suits will allow you to vacate your new ship and let it act as a decoy while you paddle through the stars, breach McTinkerClaws' vessel, sneak aboard, surprise and overtake him, and disable that weapon of his. - The meganoodle tricks-o-matic densifier! - Once you've done that, you can pilot his ship back to yours, shackle McTinkerClaws in the titanium cat cage we've installed in your storage hull, and return here where we'll hold him for trial. - What about Tinkaroo, Captain? Should he be considered friend, or foe? - I know it's hard to turn your backs on a fellow dog, boys. But until Tinkaroo proves otherwise, he should be treated as a cat. - I don't believe it! Tinkaroo, a dog-gone tuna sucking cat? What's this galaxy coming to? - If you have no more questions, boys, your new decoy ship is fueled up and ready to fly. Dog speed, boys! The entire canine species is counting on you! (Upbeat music) - The entire canine species is counting on you? Talk about pressure. I don't know if I can do this, Sky. - Sure you can, this is it, buddy. The moment we can finally shake off our past phobias and become the dogs we know we can be, Avenger Dogs! Are you with me? - No, I mean, yes, I think, probably. - [Sky Fetcher] Here we go, radar's picked up McTinkerClaws' ship just up ahead moving westward around Mars. - I'm scared, Sky. I've never been outside our ship in deep space before. (Gasps) What if we get sucked into a black hole? - Space Lobber, we can't think like that. We have to stay positive. - That's easy for you to say. You were a champion dog paddler back home. I never did learn to swim. - Just remember, we're not swimming, we're flying. You can't drown, you can't even fall, there's no gravity. We're only floating. All you gotta do is paddle in the direction you wanna go and you'll get there. - (Gasps) Okay, okay, okay, okay, let's do it quick, before I lose my nerve. - That's the spirit! - McTinkerClaws, a slow moving ship has entered our radar field. It's right behind us, moving in our jet stream. - Following us? How dare they! Does this ship show identification? - Nothing, sir, it's unmarked. Possibly a cargo vessel. - Well, they'd better hope they're hauling escape pods, because I'm going to blast them out of the stars. - You are? - No, Catbrain. Technically you are! - I am? I mean, I am! Meow, readying our laser cannons, sir! - Let the ship get a little closer first. I want to watch as they're blown to smithereens. (Laughs evilly) - Meow, sir! (Suspenseful music) (guns firing) (explosions booming) Direct hit, sir. The ship's destroyed. - Excellent, good shooting, Catbrain. That'll show 'em to try sneaking up on McTinkerClaws! - [Sky Fetcher] And yet, here we are! - Huh, who said that? - The Avenger Dogs! - The Avenger Dogs? How did you get on board my ship? - It was easy. Well, not really. But easier since we squeezed out of those tight space suits. - You ain't kiddin' buddy, at least we can breath now. - Come on, Tinkaroo, you're coming with us. - I am? I mean, I am! Oh, thank goodness! I thought you'd never find me. I was brainwashed into thinking I was a cat. But, the trick wore off, and I finally remembered who my real friends and family are. - What? But I fed you, cared for you, played Scrabble with you, your traitorous little (mumbling). - Zip it, sandpaper tongue. We're dogs, we stick together, and we win. Get used to it! - Oh, yeah? We'll see how far you dogs get with no bone marrow for treats, to see your precious bone-verse is empty. Bone dry as they say! (Laughs evilly) - Guess again, litter box feet. While you were busy shooting down our decoy ship, we were busy recalibrating your little toy. - My little toy? What? What have you done to the mega neutron dimensional destructor? - Oh nothing, it's still shiny as new. - Sure is, we just read the manual and switched it to reverse density, then set it to overdrive and let it rip. - Yup, check out the bone-verse now! - What? That cannot be! You can't regain bone marrow power once it's been obliterated, it's not possible! - Oh we didn't regain it, we duplicated what was left. - Yeah, and then we triplicated and quadruplicated it. - That's right, we set your weapon to duplicate to infinity. (Laughs) - Then we broke it. - You what? - You heard him right, kitty cat. We busted your little toy into a million pieces. - There's no getting that thing to work again. That's for sure. - You cretins! The mega neutron dimensional destructor was my life's work! My masterpiece! My legacy! - Not anymore it isn't. - Yup, it's pretty much a hunk of sheet metal and bolts now. - You smelly, sniveling space mutts will regret this. - Maybe. - Maybe not. - I'd bet on definitely. I will rebuild! I will return! I will have my revenge! - Yeah, whatever. What do you say we suit up and blow this popsicle stand, Space Lobber? - Sounds good to me! (Whistles) (upbeat music) Uh oh! - Uh oh? Why uh oh? - We don't have a suit for Tinkaroo. How are we going to take him back to our ship? - Hah, I told you you mangy mutts wouldn't get far. You can't even pull off a proper cou without bungling everything! - Oh, (groans) I hate it when he's right. - It's okay, guys, leave me behind. I'll be okay. - No way, Tink. We leave no dogs behind. - His name is Catbrain and he's with me. I'm not letting you go without a fight, mister. I've come to enjoy your canine comradery at times. Not always, you know, but often enough. You're not the most doltish dog I've ever encountered, I'll give you that. - Oh, Professor McTinkerClaws, I've never heard you say such a nice thing. - Yeah, it was kinda nice for Professor McTinkerClaws. - I didn't think he was capable of this! - Neither did I! - Well, enjoy it, mongrels, 'cause it's about to be the last thing you ever hear. - Is that a threat? - I'm pretty sure. - Now it's time for you to get these claws. (Hissing) What? How? Where did they go? Where did they go? - I don't know, sir. They just disappeared. - Well, look around, you numbskull. They couldn't have gotten very far. (Upbeat music) - Whoa, what just happened? - Are we dead? Is this heaven? - No, Space Lobber, it's not heaven. But it's close. It's good ol' outer space. But I'm flattered you see me as a heavenly creature. - I told you boys the mighty universal ear perk could come in handy, didn't I? - You used the perk on us? You transported us out of McTinkerClaws' ship? - It's all true. - But Tinkaroo, we left him behind. We gotta go back! - Going back risks your victory into a defeat, boys. You accomplished your mission, destroyed McTinkerClaws' weapon, and restored the bone-verse, correct? - Well, let's see. Take a look for yourselves! - Wow! Look at all these bones! I ain't seen this many bones in all my life! It's incredible. - We did it, you guys! The bone-verse is thriving! There's enough bone marrow power here to feed whole generations of dogs! - And McTinkerClaws lost his weapons of mass destruction. All's right with the bone-verse and the universe. Except for poor Tinkaroo. He sacrificed his dog-ness for the cause. - Yeah, he's a real hero. We'll see him again, though. - You think so? - I know so. Come on, let's head home and tell Captain Fuzz Face the good news. - Hey, can we swing by Space Jacks fly-through on the way? I've been thinking about those 10 piece nuggets and vanilla shakes since last time. - [Sky Fetcher] Fine, Tuff Nut, we'll go by Space Jacks. - [Tuff Nut] Sweet! Hey, somebody reach outside and grab me one of them bones too. Oh, they look yummy! - No, Tuff Nut! - What? - [Tuff Nut] Oh come on, why not? Just one little bone!
