[music playing] [thudding] [grunting] [thudding] [humming] [whirring] [WHISPERING] Hey. Hmm? Is that my wife under that hair? [groaning] She just might be. WALTER: Happy anniversary. Hmm. You too. [car chirping] [laughter] RECRUITER 1: Hey, there he is. MR. ECKERMAN: Did you see the way he bounded down the stairs? You remember the guys from the University of Washington. Skylar. Hey, guys. Huh. We've got some literature about the campus and the program. You should come for a visit. Just give us a call, and we'll set it all up. Cool. Hey, go long. Why would I? I'm a quarterback. Yes. Yes, you are. [rock music playing] DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: QROK in the morning. It's 11 after 8:00, and it’s time to get up and go to work. DJ 2 [ON RADIO]: Or it's time to phone in sick. And don't forget the high school season opener is happening tonight at the stadium. DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: Yeah. The Bulldogs will be led by their highly-scouted QB, Skylar Eckerman. DINKY: Woo-hoo! DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: And we’ve got the Eck live in person, in the studio tomorrow. - The Eck. - The Eck! - Shut up. BOY: Oh-ho, yeah! [clapping] [scattered cheers] [school bell ringing] Morning. Morning, Nisha. Coffee? Oh, yeah. Thanks. I'm not very good at this. You seem pretty good at it to me. [door closing] [panting] WALTER: [WHISPERING] Oh, god. Oh, god. What did I do? What did I do? So this is a big game. You nervous? Um, I'm OK. Sure he is. Can't you see his fur shaking? [laughter] How come you get to dress in here, anyway? Because the girls' locker room is being painted. [laughter] [band playing] [crowd cheering] CHEERLEADERS: Let's go, Bulldogs! Let's go! [shouting] And now, it's time for the Churchill Bulldogs! Your quarterback, Skylar Eckerman! [cheering] [grunting] [camera clicking] [crunching] WALTER: Ow! [crowd exclaiming] [panting] DINKY: Eck! [groaning] ROY: Skylar! Eckerman! SKYLAR: Oh, don't touch me. Ah. It'll be all right. [panting] Breathe. Hang in there. Hang in there. [thudding] [laughing] Oh. Thank you. You're very welcome. Do you think your parents like the table, Chloe? OK. It's weird enough being on a double date with my parents without you stressing about where we sit. Right. Ah. Mrs. Pierce, you look very nice tonight. Oh, well, thank you. You know what they say. If you want to know what a woman will look like in 20 years, just take a look at her mother. And from where I'm sitting,things are looking very good. [laughing] Now, tonight's on me. Oh, Paul, you don't have to do that. No, no. That's not necessary. It's your anniversary. Try that. Oh. You'll like it. Mr. and Mrs. Pierce, you two are very important to me. A marriage like yours makes people believe in marriage. When you have two people who are committed, keep working together, never stop... Why are you being so weird? Mr. Pierce, I think you know how much I love your daughter. I truly do. And that's why I wanted the two of you here today. Uh-oh. What's happening? Chloe? CHLOE: Yes? I know I've only lived a fraction of my life, and I am so lucky to have already found you. The only mistake I can make in my life would be to not ask you to spend the rest of it with me. Oh! PAUL: Will you spend the rest of your life with me? Yes. Of course I will. Oh. Put it on. DEBORAH: Oh. It fits. [giggling] Daddy, I'm getting married. That is so wonderful. Mr. Pierce, if I could just be half the husband you are. I was. I was, but you be. You be. I'm not. DEBORAH: Huh? Walter, what's going on? WALTER: Um... CHLOE: Daddy? Um, I... I did something that I didn't mean to do, that I didn't understand. What? She was sweet, and she was nice to me, and I slept with Nisha. CHLOE: You... [WHISPERING] I'm sorry. WAITRESS: And how are you folks this evening? MRS. ECKERMAN: It's bad, isn't it? Don't worry, sweetheart. These folks are like magicians nowadays. I wish I had better news for you, but it's the worst tear I've seen. This is major. How long until he's back? When the swelling goes down,we can talk about surgery. But realistically, he won't be coming back. [scoffing] BOY: Oh, hey, Mrs. Eck. BOY: Hey, Mrs. E. Will you excuse us for a second? I've got to talk to my son. Later, guys. Hey. Where's Dad? He's having a little trouble right now. Why? Well, we never know what life has in store for us. And Sky, you have got so much ahead of you. But one thing you don't have ahead of you is football. Don't. Why don't you take your gift? Oh, I can't... I can't... She said take it, Dad! Go on. You've already given me mine. Ow! Great anniversary, Dad. Good timing, by the way. [crying] [door slamming] [sighing] Hey. NISHA: Hi. What have you got there? It's my anniversary gift. [crickets chirping] [music playing] [panting] [grunting] [panting] I, uh... I [beeping] OK I've got to be, um,quiet because you're sleeping. And um, I know you really are sleeping because I can hear you snoring. So I just thought it would be a lot of fun to give you this video camera for our anniversary so we could take it on trips together. 24 years... it's gone by in a flash but so slowly. Um, we had a lot of fun, didn’t we, before we got too busy? I mean, I guess I've been too busy to... to realize how much I've been missing you. And I'm... I'm sorry. Walter, you know, with the girls both gone now, I... I really... I kind of feel like we're going to be starting over again. And I'm... I'm really looking forward to it. I... it's been such a long time. And I, um, I love you. And... and happy anniversary. [WHISPERING] I love you. OK. [sobbing] Mom? Oh, Mom, it's OK. [crying] DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: QROK in the morning. DJ 2 [ON RADIO]: And joining us on the line is Bulldog QB Skylar Eckerman. Hey, Skylar, so you guys really got trounced last night... 48 to 7. DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: Ouch, Eck, what happened, man? I don't know. I didn't get into the game. DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: Oh. DJ 2 [ON RADIO]: Bummer. DJ 1 [ON RADIO]: Well, you know, it's a long season. So possibly next week, you, uh...- Hold on. I think my dad wants to say something. No, no. No, no, no. DJ 2 [ON RADIO]: OK. Mr. Eckerman will be joining us on the line. Go Bulldogs. DJ 2 [ON RADIO]: Oh, OK, Mrs. Eckerman. Now, your son has hurt himself,and what's the prognosis? Um, he... Um, I'm never playing football again. DJ 2 [ON RADIO]: Oh. [static] What the hell was that? And take your sunglasses off. SKYLAR: I like them. It's sunny out. It's sunny out? Then get your ass up and go outside. Donnie. How about you come on vacation with us? MR. ECKERMAN: You had to be a hot dog. What? MR. ECKERMAN: Showing off,blowing kisses to the crowd like a goddamn idiot? That's the reason why you hurt yourself. I'm not going on vacation,and I'm not going outside. Where you going? Where you going? - Look, I don't know. I've hurt myself. Everything's changed. [music playing] Guys are all the same. A little Asian action, and you’re back to your wife. I'm sorry. NISHA: I was just a symbol to you. You never even got to know me. You just wanted to leave her so you could go back. Look, Nisha... Just go home! What the... Deb, what's going on? Well, we started clearing out your office, and we kind of just kept going. What are you doing here? Yeah, I thought you were staying in Chinatown. Let's be civil. Look, Deb, I know you're hurt, but this is crazy. No. I'm just being realistic. We've got to get rid of this stuff, so why not just do it now? - Can I take this? - Sure. No! Yes. Can we go in the house and talk, please? No, Walter. You can't ever come in the house again. MAN: Hey, dude, check it out. DEBORAH: Let me ask you something, Walter. When you were doing her,did you look into her face and imagine mine? Deb, please. I would have bet my life,Walter, that you would never do anything like this. And now that you have,you can't ever come back. Deb, think of all we've built. I am. But you broke it. Yeah, just take it. WOMAN [ON TV]: I mean, most of our vacuums here that we sell with the help of... [honking outside] ...more expensive. DINKY: Hey, Eck! ROY: Eckerman! DINKY: Where you hiding out, man? Hey, come out for a quick drink. Just one... hundred. I'm not going. I can barely walk. Oh. Suit yourself. I hope your chair's got a seat belt. Hey, put the... put the chair down. Put it down! [laughing] DINKY: No wonder he can vent. [music playing] WALTER: And can I have anon-smoking room, please? Well, we have one, but it's full. Then I'll just take whatever you got. CLERK: Okeydoke. Thanks. CLERK: Thank you. [tearing] [sighing] [change jangling] I'm sorry, sir. Your card has been declined. What? It doesn't make sense. I'll... I'll straighten it out later. Uh, do you have another card we could use? No, not with me. I'll have my office take care of it in the morning, OK? What? Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Did you know you have a goddamn mattress floating in the pool? Well, you can't sleep there, either. [coins jangling] Excuse me. Too bad. Watch it, buddy. CLERK: No, you don't want this with me, all right? Don't go hitting me! Come on! This is a bad day to... to... [struggling] CLERK: Call the police! WALTER: Come here. Come here. Watch the glasses. WALTER: Do... Don't you. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeah! [cheering] Hey, aren't those guys underage? Yeah, what can I say? Manager's a football fan. Football brats. Great. [laughing] Hey, look who's here. It's the mascot. Hey, mascot! [music playing] Hi, guys. How are you doing? We were just talking about the game. You know we lost, right? Yes. Yes, I do. So do you think that it was my fault? Or maybe it was your fault that we lost. Because, I mean, the mascot’s a really important part of the game, right? But you did your part, correct? - Well, I... - Sit down. We want to have a drink with you. [SINGING] ...stop treading water. If the sun is setting... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, guys, he can't drink with us. He's just a mascot. [laughing] DINKY: Hey, you're dismissed. Woo! OK, gentlemen, whenever you're ready. More beer. I don't think so. DINKY: He's the Eck. He's the Eck. DINKY: I think we'll have some beer. You know what?I'm going to go get the manager. What, you didn't hear him? I'm the quarterback. Right, OK. Wait! You don't think I can still play football? Oh, boy. Watch this. [grunting] [shattering] [customers exclaiming] [zapping loudly] Can somebody call Joe, please? Jesus. Go, Bulldogs! Unbelievable. MAN: Hey, Christine. Call for you. They said it was urgent. Hello? Dad did what? [sighing] WALTER: I always knew you'd end up in jail. Just didn't know I'd be in here with you. [sighing] Hi, Dad. Christine, hi! Come here. What are you doing in town? Why do you think I'm in town? Oh. CHRISTINE: Mm-hmm. Right. Hey, Chrissy. Well, well, well. What have we here? I didn't know they arrested big football stars. I'm not anymore. I heard. So I thought that you were out following the Dave Matthews Band. I was. But I kind of stumbled into tree planting. TONY: I'm sorry, Christine. I can't release Walt. He has no known place of residence, and we're showing that he has no money in any of his accounts. Yes. I know. They emptied them. Who did? Mom and Chloe. Oh. What about me? TONY: You've got to stay, too. You're only 17, and I can’t get a hold of your parents. No, no, no. They're in the mountains. Their cell just doesn't work up there. I don't know, you guys. It looks like you're sort of screwed. Dad, maybe you should just bunk with Sky. - What? - No, Christine. Are you kidding me? Well, think about it. That way, you'll have a place to stay, and you'll have a guardian. What? No. Will that work? God, Walt. After all these years. Come on. Tony, look at them. OK. No. No. I am not going to stay with him. I don't want to stay with you, either. - Are you kidding me? - Then stay in jail. DEBORAH: Chloe, quick, come here. What is she doing? Is she bringing your dad back here? And why is she doing anything for Sky? I'm gonna get my family back. Yeah. It really looks like it. Why did you do that? Do what? Bring your dad here? I didn't bring him here. I brought him next door. Well, I couldn't just leave him there. Well, I would have. I would have. How do I look? Like an old man in a little boy's pajamas. Burrito? WALTER: Yeah. Thanks. SKYLAR: Get used to it. There's not much else. Man, this stuff is good. To be your age and to eat this stuff all the time. So when was the last time you talked to her? Christine, I haven’t seen her for almost a year. I think you know the reason for that. No. Why? Because of our misunderstanding? Is that what you call it... a misunderstanding? No. Because you crushed her. Why did you do that? Why'd you crush your wife? Yeah. Maybe when you're my age, you'll understand. On second thought, I hope you never understand. Where should I sleep? There's an air mattress down in the rec room. You've got to blow it up. [music playing] DEBORAH [ON VIDEO]: Christine getting ready. He's here. - Oh! OK. Go downstairs and get my entrance. WALTER [ON VIDEO]: Oh! DEBORAH [ON VIDEO]: Oh! WALTER [ON VIDEO]: Look at you. DEBORAH [ON VIDEO]: My little girl. You look beautiful. Look at you. Gorgeous. - You are stunning. I like your hair. Oh, you are so pretty. I'm going to get Skylar. Chloe, move. Hey, Skylar. Hey. Hi. Hi, Skylar. SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: Hello, Mrs. Pierce. Hi. SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I'm here to take Christine to the dance. Hi. Skylar, who's that? SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: Oh, that's Loretta. No, I know that. What... why is she with you? SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: Oh, because I'm going to the dance with her. Come again? Um... SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I'm... I'm going... I'm going to the dance with Loretta. Um, what's going on? You told me that we were going to the dance. Uh, no. I said... I said that I would take you to the dance. But I'm going with Loretta. CHRISTINE [ON VIDEO]: Sky. SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I... I know why you folks are confused. It's... there's a big difference between "take" and "go." Do you folks have a dictionary? I mean, we can clear this whole mess up. CHLOE [ON VIDEO]: Chris, don't... don't cry. SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: I mean...CHLOE [ON VIDEO]: Asshole. [CRYING] Stop filming. CHLOE [ON VIDEO]: Fine. OK. Sorry. CHRISTINE [ON VIDEO]: OK. Choose... her or me. I choose not to choose. WALTER [ON VIDEO]: What’s the matter with you? SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: What’s the matter with you? Get out of here, you little prick. SKYLAR [ON VIDEO]: Hey, just be calm. Calm down.- Get out... just get out. Hey, old man! WALTER [ON VIDEO]: Get the hell out of here! Damn, get off my property! [sighing heavily] [music playing] ERIC: Good morning, Walt. What's up? Hey, Eric. Um, just getting the paper. Well, aren't you going to take the rest of it? Um, just going to wait till later. Breakfast is almost ready, so... Oh. Take it easy. You know, on second thought, I think I'm going to take a walk. I'm going to earn my breakfast. SKYLAR: Where have you been? If your parents got the newspaper, I wouldn't have to steal mine. They stopped while they're gone. Oh, that makes sense. It's the business section. Trust me, they'll never know it's gone. You want a burrito? No, thank you. OK. I'm going to start with a smoothie. Suit yourself. So Walter, what do you got on for today... other than getting your family back? So I should probably lend you some clothes. I mean, we're practically roommates now. You know, I saw your trophies. It's none of your business. All right. OK. I mean, we are practically roommates. Maybe it'd be a good idea to get some exercise. It'd be good for your knee. No. Not a chance. Well, you got to start working if you plan to get it back. Do you want it back? It... it'll never be what it was. Yeah, well maybe my marriage, either. What else are we going to do? [door shutting] [women laughing] Oh, I think it's them. Yup, it's them. What are they carrying? SKYLAR: I don't know. - Go look. No. Come on, Skylar, please. Just do this for me, please.Please. - OK. - Thank you. DEBORAH: Yeah. Yeah. CHRISTINE: Besides, Joe's going to give it... DEBORAH: Yeah, I agree. This'll be really good for me. Hey, is that Skylar? CHRISTINE: Yeah. DEBORAH: What is he doing? Hobbling on his crutches. Some comeback. Poor kid. Whatever. Well? [PANTING] Yoga mats. The ladies are carrying yoga mats. Yoga mats? Hi. I came to pick up my check. Oh, your wife already called, and we deposited it right into your account. What? You've never done that before. Why? Is there a problem? [stuttering] No. No, no, no, no problem. No problem. Oh. Hey, there. You got a minute? They're... they're looking for you. Joe. Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Oh, Joe. J... oh. [crying] JACK: Walter. You know Tom Jerret, folks from human resources, Beth from legal. Yeah, of course I do. Please, sit down. You may have noticed Nisha in here a moment ago. Yeah, I did. She's very upset. WALTER: I know. Which brings me to ask,how is everything at home? You can tell us. What's going on? Um, I sort of moved out. Oh. Oh, that's too bad. Walter, having an affair isn't a problem. But doing it at work is. I mean, we've all done things we'd like to keep quiet. These are modern times. Have you heard of the internet? Yeah, I believe I have. It's a great way to meet ladies. Not that we'd want to know about you doing it from work. Oh, no, no. JACK: I think we're all saying the same thing. TOM: Don't dip your pen in the company ink. And if it happens again, we have to put it on your permanent record. Not that we'd ever let anyone read your permanent record. [laughter] You've been a great employee, Walter... working weekends, never taking a vacation. Hey, how much vacation time you got saved up? Hey, hey. How'd it go? I'm taking a little time off. Oh, I know what's happening. There's a place you can go where they understand. Yeah.The Executive Suites Motel. I know. I tried that. No, no, no no. You know, there's a book I think you ought to read. It's the best book ever written. And it's called the Bible. Have you heard about it? OK, yeah. Yeah, I heard about it. I think they have it at the motel. Thanks, Joe.- It'll keep you company. Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,everything's under control, OK? I'm eating burritos. I'm wearing "Star Wars" pajamas. I'm sleeping on an air mattress. Thank you. No, no, no, no, sir. You are correct. You have no money in any of your accounts. So she could just clean out all my accounts? Correct. They're joint accounts. But we never took the money out jointly. Actually, we never put the money in jointly, either. Well, that's not how joint accounts work, sir. Well, what can I do? Well, I think you should understand the principles of banking first. Now, here's a brochure. It's called Your Future is Now. I think that'd be a very good start for you. Look, what can you do to get me access to my money? Well, you should've thought of that before, frankly. Before what? Well, sir, there are only a few reasons why a woman empties all the bank accounts. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where's the manager? I want to talk to the manager right now. I am the manager, sir. You're, like, 22. 27. What am I going to do? You should have thought of that before. [gasping] I have a Sears card. Pardon me, sir? I have a Sears card. My family and this bank may have lost faith in me, but the good people at Sears,they still believe in me. I've got this card to prove it. [laughing] Finding what you need? Uh, no. None of these is exactly right. Oh, well, what would the perfect card say? I'm sorry. We've got lots of "I'm sorry" cards. I'm sorry you got laid off. WALTER: Nope. I'm sorry you're turning 40. [laughing] No, no. You can buy a blank card and write whatever you want inside. Yeah, that's a good idea. And how will you be paying for this, sir? Um, with my Sears card. Great. What's my available credit limit? You have $718 remaining. Ooh, all right, then. I just better take necessities. I definitely need this. Um, forget the clothes. And I want the yoga book. Great. [chatter from television] WALTER: How's the training going? Pretty good. I just about figured out how to change channels with my chin. WALTER: Oh, wow. Got you something. What's that? WALTER: It's a vest so you can run in the pool. It takes the weight off your joints... for example, your knee. How do you know that? I read. Hey, when you're done here,I, um, I need your help writing a love letter. What would you usually write? I'm not sure. Never written a love letter. Honestly? Love letters are something I get, not give. Well, you might want to start learning, jock boy. Your days are up. Thanks. [Walter chuckling] So what did you do when you were courting? Courting. How old do you think I am? Let's see. You guys were getting together in the '80s, all right? So that's a very romantic time... Flock of Seagulls, Styx. Late '70s, actually. Really? Was there even music back then? Like what... that doo-wop stuff? [SARCASTICALLY] Ah, ha, ha, ha. What was your guys' song? What was yours and Chrissy's song? That's personal. Oh, now, it's personal. I figured you could use some words from your song. That's all. All right. I'll tell you my song. You tell me your song. You wouldn't know it. WALTER: How do you know? Too old. [laughing] Try me. Sing it, then. Sing it. Maybe... maybe if I hear it, I'll know it. [SINGING] You are my joy. You are my joy. If I could... [laughing] I just wanted to see if I could get you to sing it. Ha ha. Now you. - "Darling Be Home Soon" by The Lovin' Spoonful. [laughing] Sorry. Didn't mean to laugh. I just... you know, I thought it was funny. Lovin' Spoonful. She used to work at a tennis club. And me and my friends, we snuck in one day. And there she was, stringing a racket. And she looked up at me and said, hi. And I couldn't even speak. The next day, I went and sold my car and bought a membership to the club. It's the only thing I ever really went after. Till now? Yeah, until now. DEBORAH: Hi. We're home. - Hey. Mm. Something smells good. CHLOE: Hello. So far, it's just boiling water, Mom. Oh. Well, still, it's nice to know that somebody is making something for me for a change. You look great, Mom. DEBORAH: Oh, thank you. How was your yoga class? I loved it. How's your instructor? Why do you ask that? Sometimes they move too slow or too fast. Oh, well, Ranja was a very, very nice man. [laughing] Oh! Ranja. Stop it, you. So everybody noticed my ring. Really? Wow. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought my sister might be happy for me. A diamond... symbol of the black man's oppression. Christine. Is this something your new hippie friends taught you, or... or did you get this new personality off the internet? Many people have lost their lives just so that you could have your little shiny... - Well, is it... CHRISTINE: ...bauble of... ...is it so wrong to want a man and a home and a family? Is that so bad? - Yeah. Look how well it worked for Mom and Dad. Listen, your dad was a very good man who ended up doing a very bad thing. And I just can't forgive him. That's all. Yeah, Chris, like you and Sky. DEBORAH: Girls, don't. He just disappointed me. I thought that there was a part of him that only I could see. I thought he was more than a football player. I was mad at myself that I was wrong. Yeah, well, now, he’s not even a football player. So then, what is he? Skylar. Let's make him something to eat. [scoffing] [music playing] WALTER: She's coming this way.SKYLAR: What has she got? Oh. [knocking] Yeah? Who is it? You know who it is. I saw you peeking. [gasping] - Food! It's a casserole. It's from my mom. She made food. That's a good sign. It's got shellfish in it. She knows I'm allergic to shellfish. Yes. Yes, she does. It's for Sky. Wait, wait, wait, wait, Chloe. Chloe, please tell your mom that I really want to talk to her. Please. She won't talk to you, Dad. [grunting] WALTER: Sky. Hmm? How do I look? Like an old man who's lost his mind. Isn't that supposed to say kick me? Thanks for your support. [music playing] [rain trickling] [sighing] [rain pouring] Hey, Walt. What are you doing? Just standing here. I'm not bothering anybody. There's been a complaint made, Walt. You gotta leave. All right. All right. Go home. Ha. STUDENT: [WHISPERING] He’s supposed to be the best. STUDENT: [WHISPERING] Guys, he's coming. STUDENT: [WHISPERING] Pay attention. RANJA: Welcome, yogis. Let's begin to breathe. ALL: Om. Namaste. CHRISTINE: What are you doing? Yoga. Walter sent you, didn't he? No. I'm doing yoga. It'll be good for the knee. Now, is there anybody here new to yoga? RANJA: OK. Anybody here with an injury? WALTER: No, no, no, no, no. He hasn't given up at all. As a matter of fact, he's in physical therapy right now, as we speak. Yeah. Weight training? Yeah. Yeah, that among other things. Look, sir, I know circumstances have changed. But is there any chance that you might have a spot for him? [applause] RANJA: Now, your meditation for today is to concentrate on what you want, not on what you don't want. WOMAN: OK. RANJA: Namaste. OK. Walter did send me. I knew it. How's the knee? It's not bad. Will you at least see him? Um, OK, just a second. [whispering] All right. We'll talk to him under one condition. What? You gotta get an AIDS test. Oh, man. Hi. I only smile because you remind me of one of my daughters. Oh, nice. Are you really trying to pickup a woman in a sex clinic with a line like that? Sky, when do you think you’re going to start weight training? Do I look like I'm going tobe weightlifting any time soon? Why do you ask? The recruiters wanted to know. I called them yesterday. What recruiters? The guys from the University of Washington. That's the only number I could find. I'll call some of the other recruiters if you want me to. No. What'd they say? [chuckling] No, no. I don't want to know. They said that if you work hard, there may be a place for you. Not interested. All right. Well, I wish more dads would take on the responsibility of bringing in their sons. It's for me. Oh. Good luck, Dad. [laughing] OK. I just need to ask you a few questions. OK. I... I've never done this before, so. That's OK. What prompted you to come in today? Um, I just think it's a good idea to check things out now and then. Oh, I see. Right. And would you consider yourself to be high risk? No, no, not at all. I'm not... am I? Have you been with any sex workers? - What? - Prostitutes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,no, no, no, no, of course not. But you have had relations with someone other than your wife? Um, yeah. Heterosexual, homosexual, or both? Listen, I slept with a woman. It wasn't my wife. It's cost me everything. So can we just do this? OK. Thank you. So negative is good. Yes, it's good. But it doesn't sound good. I know, but it is. So positive is the bad one. But you'd think that negative would be the bad one. What is this... "Who's on First"? Oh, you do know some things before 1988. Oh. Come on. I'll race you to the clock. Let's go. [engine starting] [engine starting] [tires squealing] Mom, Dad, when's the last time we went for dinner together? Oh, I remember. Hey, uh, do you take the Sears card? I'll ask. All right. Thanks. OK. Let's get down to business. WALTER: OK. Um, Deb, you know of my love for you. Not that. You know what we need to see first. Hand it over. Thank you. Negative's the good one. Good. So what is it you wanted to see me about? I want to come back home to you. OK. No. Now, what we wanted to talk to you about is the wedding. The wedding. OK. What about the wedding? CHLOE: It's gotten a lot bigger. And we're going to need some more money. How much? DEBORAH: $25,000. Holy. $25,000... I don't have any money. Well, we thought you could dip into your retirement plan. DEBORAH: Walter, um, since you... well, since you betrayed our family, we've had a lot of time to...to think about the wedding. And Dad, we want you to be there more in spirit. What? I'm not allowed to come to your wedding? Well, I'd prefer it if you didn't. Chloe. Chloe, it's always been a dream of mine to walk you down the aisle... both you girls. Yeah, well, maybe you should have thought of that before you ate off the menu. [gasping] SKYLAR: Holy. Chloe, stop it! Chloe, I'm not going to give you $25,000 if I can't even come to your wedding. All right. Um, just... just a second. Girls. [whispering] Well, this is going great. Yeah, super. Hmm. If you hammer steel, it just gets stronger. OK, here's what we propose. You can walk me to, but not down, the aisle if you agree to our financial considerations. Done. Um, we do not take Sears cards, sir. Oh, man. CHRISTINE: There's an old tree planter joke... Well, hello. What's a tree planter's joke? Just the meanest and dirtiest jokes imaginable. Something to keep your mind off planting trees? Exactly. Why are fat girls so nice? I don't know. Why are fat girls so nice? Because they have to be. Oh. Why are you telling me that terrible joke? You're nicer since you hurt your knee, helping my dad. We're helping each other, actually. He's not such a bad guy. Yeah, well, of course you'd think that. What's that supposed to mean? You know, you're only a year older than me. And you're always way ahead of me. Yeah, I know. I don't mean it as a compliment. You're always looking back,waiting for me to fail you. And you did. I know I went about it the wrong way. I just didn't want a girlfriend. Well, maybe you should've told your girlfriend that. Chris, you weren't my girlfriend, OK? Just because we had sex doesn't mean that... Oh, my gosh, you are such a fucking football player. Yeah, I am... or was. Oh. You know what? You could never get past that. I am a football player. It's all anyone's ever been telling me since I could hold the thing. God, I am so tired of this football country. All anyone ever talks about is follow your dream. And what do they really mean? Yeah, follow your dream. Be a rock star. Be on TV. Be an athlete. What's better... follow your dream, or travel to the middle of nowhere and be a tree planter? Is that better? No. How about listen to the voice inside of you? Maybe it's saying do the other thing. Maybe it's saying don't follow your ego. Just... just live your life. You know what? I did plant trees. But next year, I'm going to be off at college, and you're going to be sitting here thinking about what you used to be. [splashing] [rattling] [SINGING] Baby, it's all right. Stop your crying now. Nothing is here to stay. Everything has to begin and end. A ship in a bottle won't sail. All we can do is dream that the wind will blow us across the water,a ship in a bottle set sail. Some might tell you there's no hope in hand just because they feel hopeless. But you don't have to be a thing like that. You'll be a ship in a bottle set sail. [music playing] What have you got there? It's from Sky. I think this is Dad's handwriting. WALTER: Sky, Chloe's here. SKYLAR: What is she doing? She's coming this way. I see you. Hi, Chloe. We need clarification. Which one of you sent this? I did. Hm. Figures. You should think about apologizing some time instead of moaning about your sucky little knee. Wasn't for you. Oh. Well, that makes sense. Come here. He's an idiot. [SINGING IN HEADPHONES] I beg your pardon. I never promised you a rose garden. I could promise you things like big diamond rings, but you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover. So you better think it over. Well, if sweet-talking you could make it come true, I would give you the world right... [breathing heavily] You never get there by forcing it but by forgiving your body. Oh. Sorry. Oh, she finally got you to apologize. That, too. I'm sorry. You are? Yeah. Great. Now I have to seriously think about forgiving you. Look, I'm trying really hard not to be a jerk. Good. You're finally admitting you're a jerk. Hmm. You do realize that it's important to think about your future? Oh, yes, very much so. That's why I'm dipping into my retirement money. Because the future is now. Your little pamphlet taught me that. I'll get you a cashier's check. Could I have cash? You think I can just go and get you $25,000 in cash? Yeah. Aren't you the manager? Prance along, Bambi. Hello. So you started playing again, huh? Uh, not really. Weren't you watching? You look good. How'd you know I was here? I saw your car. You saw my car? That's a polite way of saying that you've been stalking me. [LAUGHING] Oh, come on. You look skinny. Maybe it's from all the stalking I've been doing. I came because of the, um... I have your money. Oh, no, that's not my money. That is Chloe's money for her wedding. So you ought to give it to her. You know, Walter, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us. You have? Mm-hmm. WALTER: And? And I think that somehow,we're going to be OK. We will? Yeah. I'm getting... I'm getting used to us being apart. All right. Tell me what the recruiter said. What'd they offer? I know it's not first string. Was it second? Third? No, um... I don't know what they had in mind, Sky. Let's find out. It's the weekend. I mean, you could call them,but no one's going to be there. You're right. They'll take today off. Two-day drive, right? Let's get started. [SINGING] Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known. [SINGING] ...the Red River valley. Wait, no way. Here, you do it. You do it. You do it. [MUSIC - MOUNTAIN, "MISSISSIPPI QUEEN"] - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. That's much better. Very nice. Start with A, five seconds in between, bands. OK. Ready? Uh, America. Audioslave. Alabama. - OK, uh... - Five, four... AC/DC. Uh, uh, Abba. Five, four, three... Uh, um. ...two, ah! It's the end of the ballgame,ladies and gentlemen! Pierce, the winner. Why didn't you say Allman Brothers? Oh, of course. The Allman Brothers. I'm such an idiot. Ten Years After. Ha! Really? Yeah, they were a good band. Yep. - Um... - Five... Tool. Four... Temptations. Good. We're back to your era. [laughing] Five. - Toad the Wet Sprocket. - What? Toad the what? - Wet Sprocket. The Wet Sprocket. Yes. - There's no way that's a band.- It's a band. - There's no way. - They are a band. - Toad...- We're running down, man. Bu, bu, bu, bu, Toto! Toto, Toto... got it in. What? Toto? I can't believe you remembered Toto. [SINGING] ...another on the way. WALTER: ZZ Top. [laughing] You want to go back to A? Ah, nah. You know, Deb and I used to play that game all the time. We'd just pick up and go with no plans. We'd be driving along, see a river, stop, take off our clothes, go for a swim, drive a little more, get a room,put out the Do Not Disturb sign every night. Sometimes... sometimes we’d leave it out all day. How come you did what you did to her? We're practically roommates. Um, it just, um, evaporated. I mean, we used to be in a good mood all the time... laughing, joking,whistling, making up songs. And then, we started impersonating ourselves being in a good mood. And then, eventually, we started impersonating ourselves. We stopped describing our future to each other. It... it... it... it just evaporated. So when my assistant, she looked at me and I felt a connection, you know, that I was missing, and I went with her. And I told myself that I just wanted what everybody else had. But what I'd really done... what I'd really done, Skylar... is I gave up the kind of love that everybody else wants. Hm. Yeah. Hm. [whistle blowing] [music playing] There's some big guys. Yeah. Let's go. Sorry, fellas... closed practice. Oh, I'm Skylar Eckerman. You from the school paper? WALTER: No, I'm a football player. We spoke with one of the recruiters. OK. Thanks. Might even be third string.These guys are good. Well, well, Skylar Eckerman. This kid was a great prospect. Sorry about your injury. What are you doing now? Oh, well, I came here. Why? Well, to... to talk to you about playing football. Oh. So how did your surgery go? Well, I haven't had it yet. But I mean... So then, what am I supposed to do with you? Well, the recruiters said that they were interested, and they, uh... Sorry, son. I can't help you. What? Um... What? They inferred interest. They inferred... you said that they were interested. What they said was is that they were happy that you were working out and that there's always a chance. And I wanted to motivate you. You weasel. You weasel. I finally know what your family sees in you. Hey, coach, can I talk to you? Yeah, you're going to blow it. Blow what? This kid here is amazing. I've seen him come back in just three weeks. While you're in bed sleeping, he's working out. He's had a setback, yes. But he's a champion. You know that, and I know that. He's not only a great football player. He's also a great young man. How far do you think I can throw this thing, huh? May I? - I don't know. How far, uh, the yellow thing, the um... Sled? Sled. Sled... what is that, like 60 yards? 70. Which one do you want me to hit? - What? - Pick one. I'll hit it. Number one or number two? One, Sky. [grunting] [thudding] I can still play football. CHLOE: Where have you been? Hey, Chloe. Uh, Sky and I took a drive. What the... who's he? He's Ranja, our yoga instructor. And I found a book of tantric sex under Mom's bed. What? What's talcum sex? Tantric, Dad. It's when a guy wants to look in your eyes and do it for a really long time. What? Well, well, well, that didn't take long. You're intruding. What are you doing here? Listen, leotard, I'm her husband. Walter. Why is he in my house? We're having a simple glass of wine. I thought you were a yoga teacher. Well, I'm many things. I'm many things for Deborah, as well... a friend, a confidant. Deborah, are you in love with him? Are you, really? Well, no, not that... not really. But how does it feel? Listen, listen, what we need to do... Deborah, we need to spend more time together again. Look, maybe we could go to that Dave Matthews Band show as a family. It would be good for us. Come on. Dad, stop it, please. I can't do this anymore, Dad. It is too tiring. I can't. Chloe. CHLOE: I can't. You know, I used to think that I wanted to marry someone who was just like you. And now, I realize I'm lucky because I have a man who is nothing like you. - Come on. - No, Dad. Please, don't. WALTER: OK. Um, here. It's just... take... take the money. Take the money. No, Dad. Paul, I'm so sorry. It's OK. It's OK. CHLOE: I'm sorry. I... You seem upset. Well, change is good. I'm going to change your face, fruit loop. [shouting] Ranja! SKYLAR: Stop! Stop it! WALTER: Come here! Come here, you! Get off me! TONY: So Walter, you got to get clear on this. You know how a restraining order works. Yeah, yeah, I do. And you know you're still out on that other thing. Yeah. I mean, if it wasn't me,you'd probably be going back in. I know. I... I... I appreciate it. I'm done. I won't make contact again. OK. We got it all back but about $300. The neighbors thought you were giving it away, like the furniture. MR. ECKERMAN: We're home. Better start cleaning up. Hey, you. Ah. - Hey, Mom. - Missed you. You too. Hey, buddy. How's it going, man? - Good. - Yeah? Yeah, it's OK. I've had someone staying with me. Oh, great. Who? Hi. I've been staying here. Walter. Yep. It's time for me to shove off. Um, do you need any money? No. WALTER: You all right? - No, I'm OK. - OK. Bye. I... I'll send these clothes to you as soon as I... Uh, wait. Just... um... here. You're giving me your jacket? Thanks. Thanks for everything. SKYLAR: You too. - All right. Take care. Bye. See you. What? DEBORAH: Hey. Girls, I think your dad might be leaving. Thank you very much. I thought it was an excellent class, as well. I haven't noticed you here before. Excuse me. Oh, excuse me, ladies. Yes, Deborah? You know what? I think it's going to be better for me to start taking the afternoon class. Not Malcolm's class. But he wears a headset. Why? Well, you know, because some instructors are kind of slow, and some are kind of fast. And um, Ranja... Hm? I think it was wildly inappropriate for you to give me this book. I'm sorry. I wanted you to be open to new things. Well, yeah. I know what you wanted. But I thought you were getting a divorce. Well, I'm still a married woman. Wasn't that the same book he gave you? Yeah, it was. MR. ECKERMAN: Son, University of Washington just called. MRS. ECKERMAN: When did you go to Washington? Walter and I took a little trip. Why? They made you an offer. What? MR. ECKERMAN: How did you manage that? A little hot dogging. [laughing] Well, what's the offer? It's not what you think. Fourth string. No. Team mascot. Team mascot? It's part of the athletics department, and it comes with a scholarship. Coach says if your knee comes around, he'll find you a jersey 'cause you're worth the risk. If you're looking for a way to play again, honey, this is it. [music playing] Hey, hey, hey... how was your vacation? Truthfully? Mm-hmm. Not good. I was in a lot of pain. So I took something, and it made me feel better. So I just kept taking them and taking them and taking them. Pills. Burritos. Yeah, I couldn't stop eating them. How about that? [laughing] WALTER: Jack... Walter. I need to talk to you. OK. I'm quitting. Why? I think this will explain everything. I think we need to call someone. [dog barking] All clear. No traces of anything. I'm going to open it now. I think it's a CD. [MUSIC - DAVE MATTHEWS BAND, "BUSTED STUFF"] [SINGING] Not enough, never too much. Well, baby, look just like love. A rolling stone gathers no moss. I think we'd better transcribe this. [SINGING] But leave a trail of busted stuff. WALTER [VOICEOVER]: I know I let you down. You may feel there is no hope for us. But I do. I can give you hope if you can find a way to let me back in. I love you. [SINGING] ...leave my broken heart behind her. Oh, she's the one, she's the one, she's the one for me. [kids shouting in distance] Look at this. Oh. [sighing] Wish me luck. With what? Good luck. No. Just eight in a row. That's what she wants. We're all doing our best. I know. [sighing] Thanks. [laughing and clapping] OK. Open mine. OK. "The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands." [laughter] I thought it might come in handy. Trust me, after tonight, it's all downhill. Now, you know he's actually supposed to carry you across the threshold, not the other way around, right? Well, I had a little speech prepared. But it's all... it's all gone to rat shit. Um, all I can tell you is, um,don't let your world shrink. You know, at your age, you think everything will... will keep expanding, and it can. But... but if you're not careful, your world will shrink. You'll wake up one day and realize that it's just the size of you. I won't let that happen, Mom. I promise. And you, too. [guests oohing] Um, so I got you a little something. And I didn't want you to feel left out. Ah! Oh! [guests shrieking] And I know you girls don’t like the same things, so I got you two different colors. OK, Mom, stop it. You've gotten a little too in touch with your body. Well, the one I bought for myself is shaped like a dolphin. OK. That's enough. [music playing] [pricing gun clicking] SKYLAR: How you been? Fine. Can I help you with something? I shouldn't have teased you all the time. OK. Then why'd you do it? [SINGING] You would come on rainy days. You just... you start doing something, and before you know it,you're doing it all the time. Because I didn't think. [SINGING] Well, it made me sad. But you... And I've had a lot of time to think. I'm sorry. OK. Is there anything else? Yeah. Can you help me find a CD? Should we do a shot? Honestly if you want the advice of a woman who's been through this, absolutely. Here, hold these. [doorbell ringing] Oh, is that the caterer? It better be. Well, answer it. OK. Here. Hi. What are you wearing? Just an old thing I had lying around the rental shop. I see. I was wondering if there was a chance that I could take you somewhere. Take me where? To the other thing. OK. Now you're making sense. Hello, Mrs. Pierce. Hello. I'm going to steal her for a bit. I'll have her back in time. Is that OK? Um, OK. OK. You two look nice. CHRISTINE: What's going on, coach? I'm, uh, sworn to secrecy. SKYLAR: Thanks, coach. It's good to see you again, Christine. CHRISTINE: Thanks. You, too. So this is the other thing. I figured I owed you something. Whether or not you were my girlfriend, we did have a song. [MUSIC - SNOW PATROL, "YOU ARE MY JOY"] Can we dance? Yes, we can. [SINGING] I won't leave you out of my will. But I will leave you out of my mind for now. I won't be there to break your sweet heart. SKYLAR: Listen... [SINGING] But not being there might break your... There's something I'm having a little trouble telling you. What is it? I was offered a scholarship. Congratulations! Well, but if I want to play football, I have to start as mascot. I mean, the head coach at Washington said that I have to get my knee... why are you laughing? There's nothing wrong with mascot. Uh, I'm... I'm laughing because I’m going to the University of Washington, too. [SINGING] I would cradle you tight in my arms, always. Will you go with me in September? You can take me. But I'm not sure yet if you can go with me. [SINGING] 'Cause in the end, they'll hurt themselves much more. You are my joy. You are my joy. You are my joy. You are my... CATERER: Leave the van door open. You better run, sister. Well, that can't be good. Ooh! Here. Well, you know where they go. It's not a gift. It's from Dad. [gasping] Where did you get that? It was on the front step. CHLOE: I don't get it. It's the video camera I gave your father for our anniversary. What should we do, girls? Should we play it? Mom, it's up to you. OK. Let's play it. What is this? It's the places we never got to go. [music playing] OK. Hi, you guys. The morning before everything fell apart, I, um, I looked at our empty house with my beautiful wife asleep upstairs. And I didn't realize that it would never be the same again. And like so much in life,it already happened. I already broke your heart. You just didn't know it yet. Chloe, um, I'm sure you look beautiful today. I'm sorry I can't be there with you, but I realize that I... I don't deserve to be. Deborah, I know I... I wandered away from who I was. And I broke the beautiful thing that we had built together. But know that I never stopped loving you... any of you. So now, I'm... I'm here by myself. I'm alone and ashamed. But know that I'm... I'm filled with quiet love for all of you. I hope you all have a great day today. [sobbing] OK. Bye. We know you miss him. Have you two been talking? It wasn't just his fault, you know? It was kind of the both of you. What do you mean? For the last few years, Mom, I have dreaded coming here for dinner. It's the same food, same conversation. CHRISTINE: You were in the garden or cleaning. You never stop moving. It's like you were in your own army. CHLOE: But then this happened. And Mom, you got your spirit back. And... and look at Dad. He got his spirit back, too. I forgave Sky. And I know it's not the same. You have more at stake. But you can forgive Dad. I think, in a way, you already have. Come on, Mom. You can do it. Well, I... I... I don't even know where he is. I think I do. Where? Where executives go to rest between important engagements. Ah! Tony, Tony, I need a ride. Sorry. Oh, it's OK. OK. [tires screeching] Now, that really can't be good. [siren blaring] Hello? Hello? Oh. Do you have a Walter Pierce staying here? What did he do this time? Oh, he's not in trouble. He's my husband. Oh. Yeah, he was staying here, but he checked out. Oh. Oh, god. [banging] [MUSIC - THE LOVIN' SPOONFUL, "DARLING BE HOME SOON"] [SINGING] Come and talk of all the things we did today here and laugh about our funny little ways while we have a few minutes to breathe. Then I know that it's time you must leave. But darling, be home soon. I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if... I want you back. [SINGING] My darling, be home... Me, too. [SINGING] It's not just these few hours, but I've been waiting since I toddled for the great... Walter, you are required at home. [SINGING] And now, a quarter of my life is almost past. I think I've come to see myself at last. And I see that the time spent confused was the time that I spent without you. And I feel myself in bloom. So darling, be home soon. I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled. My darling, be home soon. Hi, Dad. Look at you. Oh, you look beautiful. [kissing] [laughing] Hey. - Hey, man. Good to see you. WALTER: Hey. CHLOE: Ready? Are you? You sure? Mm-hmm. Come on. All right. [WHISPERING] One, two, three. WALTER: Are you ready? America. DEBORAH: Ashford and Simpson. WALTER: Aerosmith. DEBORAH: Alabama. Abba. Air Supply. AC/DC. [gasping ] [laughing] Foo Fighters. F... F... F... F... Fleetwood Mac. Uh, Foghat. Fugazi. Toto. Toad the Wet Sprocket. Is that a band? [laughing] Yeah. Toad the Wet Sprocket. It is. I guess I'm going to have to trust you. You can trust me. [music playing] [music playing] [music playing]
