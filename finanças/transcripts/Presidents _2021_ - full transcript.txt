Nicolas is 5 foot 10 inches tall. François has temper tantrums. Any resemblance with real characters is left to the viewer's imagination. Nicolas! Nicolas! - Bravo Nicolas! - Nicolas for president! - Go home! - We don't want you! Beat it, loser! Fascist! Beat it! Five years is enough! I should have died several times. But I'm still alive. Well, almost. It's all in the "almost". Sometimes you walk over the hole unwittingly. This time, I must admit, I didn't see it coming. That hole. With his small-town pharmacist face. We didn't hear you. It's not worth repeating. We can't hear you anyway. Everyone has understood, France isn't at a standstill. You are. Concerning agricultural policy, we know you intend to renegotiate with Brussels, if you're elected. How will you proceed? There you go. In no time, you go from summit to cellar. I wake up. I pee. Brush my teeth. Shower. Shave. Have my coffee. My wife Natalie is an exceptional woman. She is a classical singer. Vocal exercises at every turn. It can be grating, but you get used to it. I like vacuuming. Natalie gave me Sugus for my birthday. He keeps me company when she's on tour. We watch TV together. I have to go. I like that one, it's almost noiseless. It's the Dyson Extra Pro. Yes, the motor is pretty quiet. I also like... Koenig's Axo Relax. Your phone. Can you answer it? It's Dubai. I don't know. Damned morons. I have to run. Don't forget you're seeing Georges. Georges? My life coach. I've told you a thousand times. He'll bring about a sea change in you. You can do it. I love you, my little striped zebra. What's funny is she means it. I think she really loves me. Especially when I'm annihilated. Annihilated. Positive. That's positive? Very. Annihilation is the void. The void is where everything begins. Are you sure? Very. So what next? Give me 200 euros and come back tomorrow. 3:45. I can't. I'm busy with my book-signing. Excuse me? For my book, France Forever. Forever? That's not very good. Not very good? It's not bad. Forever is forever. Hello. Emmanuel Macron plunges in the polls 6 months before elections, whereas Marine Le Pen has never had such high numbers. The President's popularity is dangerously close to the record low, which is still held by Nicolas Sarkozy. But paradox or not, François Hollande's numbers are rising since he announced his retirement from politics. 2020's pandemic has shuffled the political deck. No hypothesis, no combination can be excluded, as proved by the unexpected uptick for the "hermit of St. Bonnet", as the former socialist president is now called. Did you know De Gaulle met Mitterrand in secret on May 14, 1958? What? Mitterrand, De Gaulle. De Gaulle, Mitterrand. Hey, is anyone home? Home? You seem drugged out but you don't do drugs. Maybe try drugs so you'll seem more normal. What's that drilling sound? It's Sugus. He's been wheezing since the pandemic ended. I'm stuck here rehearsing, but you can take him out for air. I have no time. Yes, you do, really. And then... bam! Illumination. WHO CAN BEAT HER? Marine mustn't be confronted. She must be encircled. But who can beat her? Who? What if I stick an "s"' on who? Okay, it's not good grammar. But when the Wrong is bold, the Right must be brave. Learning anything? Yes, a lot. For example, here it says: "For warriors, combat is a means: they think of community. For politicians, combat is an end: they think only of themselves." And concretely? In other words, the way of the Samurai is inaccessible to politicians. If you follow Bushido precepts strictly. I mean, I think so. Elaborate. There are the 7 virtues of the Samurai. Honesty, courage, loyalty, benevolence, respect, honor and rectitude. So... it would seem, it's just an impression, that politics - I mean politics in general - requires another set of virtues. Try doing pushups in the dining car instead. You're getting fat. Hello. Anyone here? So, two rooms. You're Mr... Doesn't even know my name. There we go, I found you. It's nice and quiet here. Yes, it seems calm. Very few guests at the moment. We must not be too far from Mr... the former president. Not at all, he's in St. Bonnet. Is that far? Yes. At least 4 miles. This is a little terrace? No, a balconet. Pro-anarchy, no party, no country I get my orders straight from the galaxy Oh yeah. Not bad. It's strong. It's the subtext that matters. There's a symbology, see? Come on. Let's go, harder! Faster! But I have the dog! Thirst for power is a malady You need glory, celebrity the flashes of paparazzi But all light is not healthy Ask people in Nagasaki There's the church, there's the school. No, there. On market days, market's there, Come back in two days for the market. People here like you. In 2011, you almost got 11%. How about a drink? It's wonderful having you here. I'm the one who... Well... I can't say I'm blasé, but... I'm getting used to it. You're my third. Really? Third? I used to see big Jacques. He often came here. "Where I'm from, in Corrèze, we have apple trees." You imitate him well. With François, that makes three. François lives near here? A few hundred feet away! It's in the papers, on TV too. You know, I've lost interest in all that. But it's good for you. François is a nice guy. And big... big charisma. Yes. I see mostly his lady friend. He has a lady friend? Yes... Isabelle. They met when François' pony got sick. She accompanied it to the end. Poor François was distraught. She ended up saving the man, not the animal. She accompanied François' pony to the end? Yes, Isabelle is a vet! And a top-notch one! Nobel notch. Veterinarian is a nice job. They can save men too. See? Look, it's Sugus. Bring him here. Sugus, my little dog, my fox. It's a fox? He's a Prague Rat. - "Ratter". - A Prague Ratter. All right. He's more impressive up close. The crisp of red berries from Val d'Aoste, on its creamy emulsion. Excuse me, miss. I can't find the TV in my room. We don't have TV. - Enjoy your dessert. - Thanks. So..."tetracycline". With "Y" on a triple-letter score. That makes 30, 37, 39... 47 plus the Scrabble. Which makes 97. Give him his syrup? Yes, but he must see a vet. Oh, okay. Your turn. Actually I was impatient to meet the veterinarian. The one who saved François and not his pony. There was no need to hide it from Damien, but I have a hard time starting with the truth. When someone asks the time, I never give it correctly. Playing? "Do"? Two plus one makes... three. Not a Mini Pinscher? He's no mini. Very beautiful Ratter. You have a nice set-up. It's simple but authentic, like... I'm listening. He has some trouble breathing. Probably early-onset pulmonary edema. I'll give him tetracycline immediately. If he's not better in 2 days, he'll need a ventilator. Can you take him? How long are you here? I don't know, a few days. Just to recharge my batteries. The region is gorgeous. I can't say. I was born here. Yes, it's really gorgeous. And it suits every president. As you must know. By the way, how's François? He's in great shape. Glad to hear it. I'd love to have seen him. I don't think that's possible. He's said farewell to all that. Me too, me too... Natalie and I are like you. Return to real values, real life. Real friends. I wanted to see François for pleasure. Words get put in my mouth, but I respect him. He'll be happy to hear it. Still here, Isa? I came to pick you up. Happy? Hello. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you to our remote region? You're more St. Barth, Singapore, St. Tropez. That's the impression people have. France's heritage matters most to me. I'm glad you chose Corrèze to initiate your Parts Unknown. I hope you'll survive. I'll be fine, thanks. I was saying it's gorgeous here. So green, so wild, so warm. The mayor said your place is splendid, very authentic. An unpretentious little sheep shed. Pay us a visit some time. That's very kind of you, but... it would have to be today. I head back to Paris soon. There's lots going on. I'll tell you. Then come for a little Quinquinoix. How kind of you, dear lady. - Quinquinoix? - That's right. Quinquinoix, not QAnon. A mysterious concoction that natives... There, it's all over. How's it going, boy? It's calm. Yes. Winters here don't get long? - In the boondocks. - That's Isabelle. With him, the women decide. He can't say no. I swear, I'm a new man. Sleep like a baby, nine, ten hours. Sometimes twelve! No more migraines, no more cold sores. I even feel my hair growing back. And the food here... Look. As fit as an Ethiopian sprinter. Yes, it's not that obvious. In any case, I feel at ease with my body. - In short: pure bliss. - I can see. What do you do all day long? I don't have a minute to myself. Breakfast. Then a walk to Père Fouillu woods, back and forth. Then mail and stuff until lunch. Then a nap. Then I say hi to the bees. We set up a beehive. Near the hedge. Their honey is very smooth, very tasty. Then a little saxophone. I took it up again. Comes back fast. A drink. Dinner with Isa, a book by the fire. We often read the same book. - So we can discuss. - Smart thinking. Except on Sundays. On Sundays we listen to public radio. That makes for a full day. Very intense. And wait... there's more. Tennis, for example. You play tennis? Yes. I'd even say I'm good at it. 30-15! Think about the bees. 15-0. Shit! 40-15. Out? It was right on the line! I swear it was out. Game and set. 6 to 1. A victory that cannot be contested, bravo, Mr. President. You know, François, I often chat with my Socialist friends. Yes, I have some. Believe me, they're totally distraught. Truth is, you left an enormous void. - Perhaps. - Indeed. But I've moved on. World spins, wind picks up, the book is shut. Hear that? What? The beehive. It's just behind that hedge. Hear how they work? They never stop. - Want to say hi to the bees? - I don't feel like it. So Macron left no effect on you? The betrayal, the humiliation? None whatsoever. Not that. We must jettison our demons to move on. Yes, well... with Macron in such deep shit, taking the high road is easy. Seen his poll numbers? That has to titillate you a little. Not at all. Emmanuel has great qualities. More intellectual than moral, I'll grant you that. But he's a remarkable guy. It fell. Yes, well, Nicolas... I'm not throwing you out, but... - I have things to do. - Sure, I get it. I won't overstay my welcome. - Have a nice day. - You too. Why did you lock them up? - Fuck! - You did the number? It's 2012, 2-0-1-2. Next time put 2007. A remarkable guy... with great qualities! I'll kill you, motherfucker! I'll waste you, little bitch! Maybe my visit was useful. Yeah, 6-1, you totally destroyed him. What an idiot. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm just warming down. You didn't discuss Macron? Not at all. So how do you find the former president? I think you're in amazing shape. No, not me. The other one. His forehand was good at times... Fuck his forehand! Him, the man: what did you think? Oh, okay... My mistake. Under the surface he's a mass of contradictions. As if he's torn between chance and necessity. The combat between impulsion and reason can be resolved only by an external liberating catalyst. Yeah. Yeah, an external liberating cata... My thoughts exactly. Is that country vet reliable? Yes, look, he's breathing better. He's lively. So you're coming home? Not right away. Sugus stopped coughing. But I still have something to do. I think it's worth it. How are your rehearsals? Great! Mahler's placed in my throat. Want to hear Knaben Wunderhorn? It's late. Everyone's asleep. Just a little Trost Im Unglück, softly. At the same time, Trost Im Unglück, consolation in pain, how could I refuse? Moreover, when people need to open up, we must never hinder them. It's important. It's cathartic. Nat, I... I'm brushing my teeth, but I'm listening, go on. It's beautiful. He starts with the pork butcher, by the entrance. Next, the regional honey stand, near the tinsmith's. Now that he has a hive. Next he stops by the farmer's stand, just to chitchat. Then he always goes to the café for lemonade! Always? I just said so. Federer leaving lettuce. I repeat... Hello. Mr. President! What a surprise. You good? - And you? - Fine. Why not? I barely said... Nicolas! I don't understand what you mean. There's nothing to understand. It's as easy as ABC. Your little protégé, the one who backstabbed you, he's history. He's dead and buried. All our former colleagues are hopeless. It's over with. Marine Le Pen is sitting pretty. No need to have elections. Perhaps, but it's not my problem now. Want to hop around like a flea on a campaign trail? Feel free! As for me, I chose real life. Tell me about your real life once Marine's in power. You really don't care? Black shirts, stadiums, barbed wire? Kristallnacht, the Reichstag fire... The Reichstag fire? Aren't you exaggerating? To think I'm telling you about the threat of fascism! Topsy-turvy world! A Brown Plague brews and you stand there, arms dangling. Your usual stance. I expected that. I didn't send for you! And I blame you for that! The Republican Front, the Sacred Union, ring a bell? Only we can pull it off. So, no more political calculating. No gerrymandering. It's emergency mode. Emergency mode, meaning? I won't beat around the bush. Like I said: "Sacred Union". We both run. But not against each other. Together. We run for what? The presidency! Not for mayors of St. Bonnet. Yes. In France, I don't see how two people can run for one post. Listen, François, this is no time to nitpick, we have two months to plan this. So what I suggest is to create a party. "France Forever", for example. The party names an official candidate, For example, me. We name the Prime Minister, you, now. We campaign. And I... we're elected. And democracy is saved. More or less. It's not... You know, Nicolas, truth be told, I'd heard that your forced retirement from politics had unsettled you. But you worry me. Ever consider therapy? François, deign to listen. I know my proposition is a little unusual, but I can assure you that the tectonic plates are shifting. I can feel it. Why not the continental drift? Don't kid around. I'm telling you, it's moving. I'm not talking "tiny surface tremor". I'm talking deep. I'm talking tectonic. But when the Wrong is bold, the Right must be brave. Is that you? - Is that you? - No. Could've been. Listen, François, all I ask is that you think it over. I've thought it over. Then I ask you to rethink it over. Isa? It'll be ready soon! "I, as President", as that one said... But, I, as President, will act. Unlike that one. Butt out! I, as President, would stop taxing all pureblood French woman after the birth of their 3rd child. I, President, would impose tariffs totaling 85%... Enough. Not while we're eating. Don't you see she's attacking me? Every election season, she becomes ruthless. Honey, she's an imitator. - Are you sure? - Don't you see she's joking? It's not funny. You're starting to worry me. I thought you were cured. No, I 'm not cured. Because I was never sick. Being President isn't a disease. It's an honor and a blessing. That's debatable. No, it's not. You may not get it, but it's not debatable. You're sexy when you're angry. ...which can't gain enough momentum to win. I have thus decided not to run again for President once my term comes to an end. What are you doing? Not coming to sleep? Yes, I'm coming. I'm just finishing a movie. Any good? Not particularly. Not only does this document show your bad faith, it proves you think I'm a dummy. "That you think..." For an imbecile. Hello. Hello, dear lady. - Can we speak? - Of course. - Would you like a cookie? - I'm fine. It's sweet of you to have come. Sugus is much better. Your stuff is great, no more coughing. I'm worried more about you. Why? Since you saw François, he's no longer the same person. He's relapsing. Relapsing? You don't know because his true friends kept it hush-hush, but François went through a severe crisis after leaving the presidency. Really? A serious one? He plowed into Socialist headquarters with a tractor. Then he shredded his diplomas to make confetti for a wedding. Then he sent 100 pounds of manure to Manuel Valls in Catalonia. He was even hospitalized for 2 months in Limoges. Jeez, for a "normal" president... Well, he had become normal again. And since your visit, he's lost it. So I'd like to know what the two of you discussed. What we discussed? Yes, what you discussed. - What we discussed? - Exactly. Everything. About everything, nothing, politics... Politics? - Politics? - Yes, what else? Because it still bugs you? You're wonderful. Isabelle... as legend would have it, I think about the presidency every day when I shave. So maybe you should grow a beard. Isabelle... beards don't suit me. Same goes for François. We're hairless. We're presidents. Not anymore, that's the problem. I put him back on track, it wasn't easy, he was calm, he was relaxed, he was... protected. He could even read Le Monde and he was fine. And you show up, and... his therapy's down the drain. You mustn't destroy him. What's happening here is beyond us. We're on the Titanic and you talk about comfort. The nation needs him, Isabelle. France needs him. France or you? I am France. François is France. I swear, Isabelle, you can't wave aside François' immense potential. Nor your own. I'll tell you, now that I know you better, you have huge potential. Huge. You're real, you're strong. Beautiful. You're already campaigning. Quiet, you're beautiful. And you're lots more. It's true. You'll spend your life in this rat hole consulting cows? What a waste. I swear, and I know because I've had several, you're First Lady material. Almost First Lady, Second Lady. And from 4th to 8th, nothing available? Listen to what I said. Isa, not at the clinic? No, my work can take me outdoors. I'm very polyvalent. You even have Parisians as patients. We met by chance. It's true, it was by chance. Of course. With you, it's always by chance. No ulterior motives, no calculations, we all know. What are you getting at? I've come to say that I rethought it over. And? And it's very interesting, but I'm not interested. Safe travels, Mr. President. Great, you nailed it! Yeah...think you'll con me with your two-bit flattery? Mr. President, you hurt me. Once more. Lots of work at the moment. I'm swamped. I can imagine. No more trains to Paris tonight? Affirmative, boss. The provinces, you know. Yes, I know. Why the fuck are we here? You'll see, it's very nice. Hello. We're stuck, so let's enjoy the party. It beats playing Scrabble at the hotel. Excuse me? Can I get a selfie? Laura 1, Cassandra, Laura 2. Thrilled. Honestly not my kind of music. But he did pretty well. Most of all, he seemed so happy blowing into his bagpipe. I was going to throw in the towel, when suddenly, bam! Fate came calling. And now, the man you're all waiting for. The rising star of Socialism in Corrèze, our senator, your senator, Jean-Sébastien Bourillon! Ladies and gentlemen of St. Bonnet, good evening. What a pleasure to be with you out in the open. But first a round of applause for our former President. For once that his bad notes hurt only our ears! Sorry, François. Seriously, it was wonderful. And I'd like to tell you again how proud we are in the region in the commune, to have you among us. How could I have guessed - me, the obscure employee at Party headquarters who looked at you like a new Jaures - that you would one day be village musician? Your path is such a life lesson! A head of state who forsakes political ambition, historical destiny, to melt into the anonymous mass of farmers living in St. Bonnet. But after all, François, perhaps this is your historical destiny. This anonymous mass of farmers. And the summit, perhaps just an accident. Another one. Hello. The same thing. Still here? Yes. Transportation trouble. Not easy to leave your enchanted haven. Thank you. And I got to hear you play. It doesn't show, but you have swing in your veins. Perhaps. No one cares. And I heard that guy. Senator whatever. I'd never heard of him before. Let me tell you something, François. He can say what he pleases, I don't buy your retirement. Apparently, you're alone. I bet, deep down, you don't buy it either. Where did you disappear to? - I was worried. - Just a little walk. - So early? - Yes. Did you meet anyone? I met France. All right. Is you hot-shit PR guy nearby? We're almost there. We're lucky he's at his country home! He mostly works in Paris. He works nonstop. Nonstop? How old is he? Who could find younger? 48! Can he set up a press conference on such short notice? He's the guru of all the newsrooms. Le Monde won't publish a weather report without his okay. If he's that good, he can help with our campaign committee. I'm not worried. He knows everyone! With women. Nowadays it's hard to start something new without women. Don't you think? Yes. Should be doable. At worst there's Ségolène. What's wrong? Are you okay? No, it's... There was a hole in the road. Leave that ditch! I'm working on it. I'll switch over to electric. Much better! Coming, Nicolas? It's not possible. Why not? He has no time? He has plenty of time. He's currently dead. Dead? At 48? - From what, Covid? - I didn't dare ask. His mother was so shaken, I could barely understand. We rode 15 miles for jackshit. Not for jackshit. I'll show you something rare. You really feel like it? Abbeys aren't my thing. Come now, the Aubazine Abbey is the jewel of Corrèze. Attracts visitors the world over. To reconnect with France's heartland, start with the basics. Well, if it's the jewel of Corrèze. It's pretty. It's pretty. What's so great is that it's touching. So it's here that little Gabrielle Chanel, who spent six years in our orphanage, it is here that she found her inspiration for the famous Chanel logo. The renowned double C, now recognized all over. See? We can easily make out the interlacing pattern which is both the link and the chain. Strength and servitude. For our logo. Looks more like the Yves Saint Laurent logo. So? It was worth the trip, right? Very good pâté. Isabelle made it? No, I did. No kidding. Can you stop with the sexist remarks? Women may do the cooking in your milieu, but the world has moved on. In my milieu, as you say, it's not man, not woman, it's catered. You're missing out. Maybe. I don't like cooking. But I do like vacuuming. Do you? Helps me unwind. I understand that you need to. You're wound pretty tight. I thought things would end up softening you. What things? Everything. Your wife left you, I beat you in 2012, Fillon ditched you in 2017, the charges... No, I'm not softened! - I'm nervous. - Okay. It's my nature. Nervous and resistant. No more pâté? Yes, there's some more in my bag. What's this? Proust. You must have time to lose if you're searching for lost time. Nope. Don't think that. For me, Proust is a daily inspiration. Really? I wanted to ask you something. The fake wall behind the desk at the Elysée. Did you find it? You mean the secret room behind the tapestry? With the comics, Tintin, Asterix, you bet I found it! It was your collection, not Chirac's? Some were his, some were mine. What did you do with them? I left them there, with a note for Emmanuel. That reassures me. Know what? Our Asterix comics... we'll get them back, François. We'll get them back. But this renewal requires a change that's radical, profound, irreversible, in French environmental policy. That's delicious. To this effect, we have consulted our friends in Eurape... Europe! I always get their damn name wrong. You better try harder because we need them. They should change damn name. All right. It's not complicated. - Look... - I'm not your student. Europe. Ecology. - Ecloclogy. - Ecology. The Greens. The Groins. The Groins. - Europe-Ecology-Greens. - Eurape-Eclology-Groins. "We've consulted our friends in Eurape, Eclology, the... Europe, Ecology, the Greens." Concentrate, Nicolas. You have it! "Europe"... You do it on purpose. There you go! - I got it. - Start over. Europe, Ecology, the Greens. Europe, Ecolojay, the Grains. I was thinking about your idea for the party. "France Forever". I must say it's rather... very old right-wing. No, France is France. Forever is forever. Universal values cover the whole spectrum. I don't know... It's very weak. Look who's talking. You never change. My party, my government, my presidency. We know how you operate. Not at all. You changed your party's name without asking... - A first! - I never did that. - You did. - I did not. - I have the dates. - Not true. - It is true. - It isn't. It's not true. - It's a lie. - Here we go! - It's slander, you're... - "A slanderer", as you've said. - I never said that. - I have the dates! - Not true. I never... - You said it! - I'd remember! - You said it! You said it! You said it, I have the dates! - Okay! - You said it. Okay. Perhaps in the heat of the moment I said things I didn't mean. You said it! François... We moved on. Let me tell you something. "France Forever"... I like it. It's catchy. If you have better, I'm open. There. "Democracy and Progress". Why not "What a Wonderful World"? Isa? We need a party name. We're stuck. Any ideas? When I see you both, the first idea that comes is... "Together". "Together" is good. "Together Forever". "Forever" is perhaps a bit much. But why not? We'll leave you... thanks. How do we finance our campaign? We'll need to find 25 mil. I'll leave that to you. You're the campaign finance specialist. If you're spiteful, we'll never manage. Wait for the cameras to launch your nasty missiles. You're so easily offended! Okay, the past is now behind us. There. I'm cut off from everything here. You're the networker. Ask Paris Saint-Germain. It's doable. But support from intellectuals is right up my alley. Really? Yes. Francis Cabrel. Francis Cabrel? - I Love Her to Death? - Yes! We met at the Vegan Country Festival and really hit it off. No kidding. Me I was nothing But here I am today The guardian of her nights' sleep I love her to death You can destroy everything you like All she has to do is open her arms To rebuild it all I love her to death She erased the numbers on neighborhood's clocks She made of my life paper birds Bursts of laughter She built bridges between us and the sky And we cross them each time She doesn't want to sleep I love her to death She must have fought in every war To be so strong today She must have fought in every war Of life And of love too We're not that bad off here. Don't call, I want to surprise him. He's in a meeting at St. Bonnet anyway. Admit that sounds weird. You're not hiding things, Damien? Are you kidding? My zebra! - You came. - I came. And you're here? I'm here because I came. Not happy? Yes, yes, of course I am. I can see you're not. What? You look like the hypocrite who fired me from Tosca. No, this isn't about you. Damien, take me to the station. I'll wait on a bench. What's this about? Natalie, listen... You're right. I'm a total idiot. I'm seeing someone here... - Who? - Relax, it's nothing like that. However... it's someone you don't really like. So please make an effort. - I voted for you in 2012. - No, really? Yes, in both rounds! I voted for you twice. Yes, but we hadn't met yet. So what? I'd still have voted for François. - Thanks. - Don't take it personally, zebra. "Zebra"... how charming! My family votes right since the Crusades, but I vote left. I vote left because... I can't say why. So don't. It comes from within: no explanation. That's conviction! Yes. I loved your "normal president" routine. It's meaningless, and yet it's obvious. It didn't remain obvious. You're so good at riposting. You must be tough in debates. When I discuss with goats, I have the last word. I'm going to like it here. But I need to work a little. Know a local accompanist? To show you around the region? No, to accompany me on piano. Balthazar plays pretty well. He learned in prison. Your security officer did time? Yes. No, yes, very little. That's nice, it's... "social". Hello, everyone. No, you're not dreaming. It's really me, and it's really him. You have before you two former presidents, side by side. And today is not Bastille Day, this isn't the funeral of someone illustrious, and I was going to say, that there's no national emergency. But there is. There is a national emergency. Our head of state, a great guy at first... is in his underwear. Extremists lurk in the shadows ready to lunge on the helpless State. This is why we're here today, myself and François. Absolutely. Myself and Nicolas have decided to propose to the country a new way forward. Three... one... and relax. Excellent. That was nice. Recuperate. Thank you, it's just a little rehearsal. It's exceptional. Your voice is an enchantment. It grabs you viscerally. That was great. You heard? I'm just above. And your voice carries! You were here? I asked François et Isabelle to dinner. The receptionist mentioned some Indian nearby. Der Tiger von Eschnapur. We like it a lot. It was my first cesarean on a cow that old. So much blood, I thought I'd lose them both. But I stitched up the intestines. This is delicious. Then I saved the calf, all slimy. But alive. I little deformed by the incarceration. Spare us the details. I doubt calving interests Natalie. No, it's very interesting. It's nature. Sure, Isabelle's a straight-shooter. That's the true path. Let me tell you something. People are sick of sales pitches. They've had enough sugarcoating. Veterinarian is both authentic and deeply fusional. Life-long desire? No... After graduating, I joined the Israeli army. 4 years in the Golan, in a tank. Damn hairy, tanks in the Golan! I wasn't particularly Zionist. I'm not Jewish either, actually. But I needed something different. I wanted to see action. There aren't many wars to choose from. Now I'm more into peace. We can't know calm unless we know conflict. My coach says: "Day needs night like fire needs ice." Speaking of fire, this is hot. Even when we say: "No spicy, no spicy". Anyway... can we still say that? I find it a bit bland. Were you into music very young? Very. Actually, I cried a lot as a kid. It drove my family crazy. So I found a way of wailing that was less aggressive. I realized that with music underneath the wailing was bearable. So it was intentional. It was to be understood. Self-expression requires self-mastery. Communication is control. Except when we fuck. We let go then. That's what it's for. Excuse me. Hello, Mr. President. You saw the press conference? That's kind. It means a lot coming from you. Wait, just one second. Do they often speak? No idea. I keep out of his private life. Sorry for "great guy in his underwear". It came in the heat of the moment. Yes, but I called you a great guy. All right, well... that's nice, Emmanuel, I'm glad you like the idea. Who "him"? Loser? I think you're harsh. He's anchored in real life. His wife birthed a calf this very afternoon. I'm not saying that's necessary to run France... Exactly. He'd be at my side. It's different. If you want to discuss when I get back, I'd love that. Warmest regards to Brigitte. Goodbye. Excuse me. So what does he say? Very impressed. Compliments don't come easy to him. He kept heaping on the praise. He could have called me. I think you intimidate him. Yes, perhaps. Actually, you're pretty intimidating. You remind me of that Hollywood star. Come on, very famous! I forget his name. You find him intimidating now? Great. To think how you badmouthed him! What did you call him? "Social-traitor, baleful gaze". He's charming in fact. - Charming? - Yes. I mean... he has something. A sort of mystery. And an intense listener. I've sung to adoring throngs, but never felt such proximity with an admirer. Proximity. He better cool it, Harvey Weinstein on the Prairie. Is my zebra jealous? You're the one who unearthed him! Yes. Zebra may have played the wrong horse. You know, he looks at you with respect. With restraint, of course, but with great loyalty. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. It really was worth coming. It's even better in the spring. When everything's in bloom, flowers, wild scents, mounting sap. You're a poet! How can I not be one in your presence? You're a magician. You enchant everyone around you. I bet you say this to all the girls. Everyone knows you're a womanizer. What? Not at all. Journalistic shenanigans! They want to sully me. That you - yes, you in particular - give credence to these silly rumors... hurts me beyond repair. You'll get over it, I'm not worried. Everyone knows I sing classical. Yes, everyone does. But since I'm here, notes and words hit me from every direction, like a constant bombardment. - You're inspired. - Yes. Something or someone inspires you. Yes, at all hours of the day. Like now, for example. Want to see? Yes, show me. I don't like men I don't like women or children I like flames and I like blood Especially when it's... brutal I never dream but when I dream What I dream is that you scream And that you agonize in a hole Fatal I want to you see your skull smashed open The earthworms and weevils That eat your flesh and make you feel such pain Yeah! Very fresh, very refined, I love it. Isn't he a little dumb? Yes. Why did we choose him? He's the mayor. Okay. Let me explain once more, Jean-Jacques. We'll be holding several debates. We must be ready for all situations. All right? So pretend you're an extreme-right leader. I'm not a fascist. We're not asking you to be a fascist, but to pretend. You must attack us so we can practice, see? Yes. I don't know. I don't want to hurt you. I admire you both. Jean-Jacques, that's kind... Let me explain something. François and I aren't beginners. We can defend ourselves. Okay? So bring it on! Bring it on! Don't be afraid. Let go. It's for the right cause. - Okay. - Bring it on! It's for the right cause, so I'll try. Funny seeing you two together. How many years in office all together? 90 years of political scheming? Yes, you really are a duo for rebirth! Kidding aside, what's the story? Because each of you failed individually, you can succeed as a duo? We said to let go, but... within reason. Excuse me. No, on the contrary, it's good. Hit hard! In real debates, you get hit. François is "moderate"', but don't let up. What do you mean, "moderate"? Moderate. Prudent. Cautious. Indecisive, pusillanimous, timid, shy. Inconsistent. Moderate. Why so suddenly aggressive? I get aggressive. It happens. Please, forgive me. Not everyone is normal, honey-eating, wooing married women. I don't do anything special. Not my fault women like me. Okay... what do I do? As Nicolas said. - Do as I say! - Okay. - Go on! - Okay! You'll screw up again! There! - Know why? - Why? You have nothing new to offer! Not as one, as two or as ten! You're all used up! You're empty on the inside! You're over with! Excuse me. Want to come to Limoges when I get my hair dyed? You're very blonde. So? No, it just makes you look a little harsh. Or warlike. Yes, populist. Yes, it's my new style. Tomorrow I deport immigrant bulls to the Cantal. Then I say mass in Latin for Joan of Arc's lamb. She was so gentle with her syringes. She was so reassuring. To think she spent her teens gunning down Palestinian youth. Not closing the door? Okay, I won't close it. Yes, close it. Okay, I'll close it. Sometime I feel Natalie doesn't understand me. That said... do I understand her? Did I ever understand the women in my life? Or even women in general? It's bothersome, running a country without understanding half its inhabitants. And the better half. If I were offered the presidency of a country without women, I wouldn't take it. Yes, nice and straight. Very good. Perfect. Perfect. Small accent? - Are you sure of him? - 100%. He's done weddings in St. Bonnet for 20 years. Mr. President on the right... Turn a little to the left. Which president? You. Very good. Very good. Zuper. Zuper! He keeps saying "zuper". - He must stop. - Please! Excuse us. There, that's good. Nice and straight... good. Now I'd like Mr. President on the left to switch with Mr. President on the right. Mr... Presidents. He's thin-skinned. - He's thin-skinned. - Sorry. Good, stay like that. Very good, very good. Look... yes, good. Good, yes. Not too much. Yes, good. It's wild how relaxed he seems. The photo causes him no anxiety. Yet he's no Brad Pitt. That must be it. He doesn't mind being middling. Lucky him. Physical flaws obsess me. Even more than the presidency. His problem, is he can't distinguish between "middling" and "normal". For him, a head of state is a demi-god lording over the blind masses. He got the era wrong. He should have lived under Julius Caesar. Or reign over England. Physique matters less there. Stay with me. Yes, very good. Official photo! Do you smell like bergamot? Climb aboard, you'll see. I wanted to show you the spot where I encountered France. Thanks to you. This is where I realized you were right. I hadn't yet fulfilled my destiny. This is my own Mount Rushmore. Yes, it's pretty. You hear that idiot Jean-Jacques? Used up, emptied out, over with. Open your eyes, man! They're the wrong words, but... at the same time... At the same time what? Ever since I got here, I've been thinking. And? I wonder if you weren't right all along. Right about what? Yes... your distance. Your wisdom. The wind has blown, the land has been tilled... Do we have to give up all this, all this for what? When in fact deep down... I don't know. What are you talking about? Your big thing, real life, nature. Not Femen Green, but real life. Fields, birds, trees, local products... You've lost it! You drunk? No, I haven't drunk at all. I was watching you, and I saw you. I was listening, and I heard. - And I understand. - No, you don't - Yes, I do! - Not at all. Trust me, François, I understand something. I'm sick of trees and birds. You can't imagine how bored I am, you can't imagine! You mustn't miss the forest for the trees. You'll regret it forever. Listen up, I need a break. I also need to go back to basics. You've taught me a lot. And you still can. When you talk about beekeeping... Cut the crap! - I saw the bees. - You can't leave me now! - This is wild! - You can't! The hills are alive! If we stop now, I'll die. I'll die! Okay then. - We'll do the campaign rally. - Yes! The campaign rally, yes! - We'll have the polls. - Yes, the polls! Then we'll decide. We'll decide after! Excellent. "Excellent"... that's saying a lot. Thanks, Nico. I prefer "Nicolas". Don't get worked up like that. I can't stand it anymore. Everyone is now focused on the little town of St. Bonnet, which hasn't known such turmoil since the Tour de France in 1974. One major unknown. Yes, the two formers heads of state have joined forces, but we don't know which one will be the candidate. CAMPAIGN RALLY Isn't the president leaning left? - Thanks, I'd never have found it alone. - It's my pleasure! Do you often light church candles? No, just for major events. I'm not a believer, but I leave nothing to chance. I don't want our acrobats to fall at the rally. Their male bonding is quite beautiful. Think it'll go far? I wasn't for it at first, but they seem so thrilled. Like beavers back in water after the thaw. Understand? No, not really. But they are a pleasure to see. I'm amazed, fresh air usually makes Nico dissolve. It was the same with François. I bet it took time to get him used to it. It took lots of love, Natalie, lots of love. Let me tell you something. Nicolas and I are fine pulling out the big guns. We'll use a Kärcher, if we must. We'll use a flame-thrower, if we must. Who's talking? The President. Sounds like the other one. The President is parroting the President. What a bulldozer. I can't go back to the shadows. I can't live in a country where everyone is blond and blue-eyed. It's beyond us. I agree with that, I'm the same. It's beyond us. Besides, I was always for diversity. Always, everywhere. Diversity is great. It's positive. It's the start of the beginning... of everything. It's tectonic. There's a technical problem. They can't hear us. Really? Mr. Mayor, can you fix this? Of course. Cédric? What's this mess? Excuse us. Technical problem. - What the hell? - I don't believe it anymore. No one's asking you to believe, just to talk. I can't talk either. I can't find the words. Listen, you're just stressed out. It happened to me. It's no big deal, just breathe. We must now concentrate on one idea. Just one. You must have one idea. It's fixed, Mr. President. Boss! Bushido! Bushido, the way of the Samurai! You know, for a politician, the fight is an end in itself. He thinks only about himself. But politicians must forget politics. They must think about the raison d'etre of politics. They must think about others. So that's my platform. It's very modest. I can put it in 7 words. Rectitude. Honesty. Courage. Honor. Benevolence. Respect. And loyalty too. See how we save time? It's pragmatic. And it works for everything. Because, if you take all your problems, and all of France's problems, and attack them like that, Rectitude, honesty, courage, honor, benevolence. respect, loyalty. No more small talk, big speeches empty promises. No more taking useless action. No more measures that measure nothing. One sole rule, the same for everything and everyone. I couldn't agree more. - For Corrèze! - For the Republic! And for France! Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Now we'll start the town hall forum, as planned. You must have lots of questions for our prestigious guests. Yes, good evening, everyone. First, thank you, everything you said was interesting. But my question is more for Isabelle. If you take to the road to accompany the candidates, given that there's no vet within 50 miles, how will we manage? Isabelle, I'll give you the mic so you can answer. Yes, and good evening, Benoît. You're foresighted, as always. It's a real question. I haven't thought about it yet, because I'm an independent woman. And I think François can confirm that. I've never made life decisions based on anyone, not even my companion. Those of you who know me know my job is my passion. The lives of animals are also the lives of people. We need animals, to work... to eat... to protect us. To defend us. And to have a friend who's sincere, faithful and selfless. And animals need us. So they can live better. In a world deformed by men who never considered the planet's other denizens. Or even themselves. So, yes, you can count on me. As long as I can make myself useful to those around me, I'll do what's required of me. Sometimes I make mistakes. Animal medicine is not an exact science. But you can rest assured, Benoît, I won't let you down. Because you asked me, and because you have, all of you, given me this chance to serve a purpose. This is too much. It's Interflora in here. I'll put some outside. What are you doing? That dog is hairless. It's not about dog hair, it's about... it's about inner comfort. It soothes him. You don't need soothing instead? Why do you say that? Tomorrow's the big day. What big day? The polls. Oh yeah, the polls. Yes. - Yes, polls. - Yeah, yeah... Ability to steer us through the crisis. Secure the homeland. Unite the country. 77%, 79%. That's good. And finally, overall approval rating. For the others, the comparison is humiliating. I'll show you. Both tied at 78%. What about voting intentions? Yes! Voting intentions is why we're here. Well, for voting intentions, it's very interesting, because, actually, indeed, what's a tiny bit troublesome... as far as we're concerned, is... it's that... Spit it out! Yes. Yes, well... Here you go. Voting intentions What's that bullshit? Sure of your numbers? They're not mine, they were transmitted to me. 4.5% makes no sense! He won't recover campaign expenses! Yes, I agree. Your ideas are well liked. You're both well liked too. You have every reason to win, but only if someone else runs. We'll win, but we've already lost. Anyway, we don't have another candidate. You do have another candidate. Except... it's a woman. A woman who knows every note on the scale. Who won't steal the spotlight but won't bow down. A master of communication who knows how to let go when... When necessary. Calm down, honey. Opinion polls show strong support for a female candidate. That's what I said. That female candidate is here now. Not me... Her. Are you kidding? This is insane! Jean-Jacques, do something! At the same time, we must take Isabelle's popularity into consideration. We can't neglect it. Yes. Give that to me. It's a guy thing, technical. I can open a window! No, you can't. Look, now it's all frozen. Jean-Jacques, fix this. I'm not your bitch, Mr. President. Yeah, we're not your bitches. Can I say something? It may not be a bad idea. Yes indeed, it may not be a bad idea at all. Except it's not mine. It always starts like that. Strangers come up to you, say they believe in you. Then the press gets involved. Then it's over. Tell me I'm dreaming. No, you're not dreaming, François. Isabelle isn't like us. She's pure, ethical, tends to animals. Power isn't her thing. And yet it is. No one can resist. Mahatma Gandhi. Therese of Lisieux. Not even Greta Thunberg. No one. three months later... Back to square one. I get up. I shave, drink my coffee. I vacuum, of course. And I have a new one, an eco-friendly Swedish brand, made of recycled composite materials. After vacuuming, lunch. Hold chopstick 2 like a pen. Index finger, middle finger, thumb. I subscribed to a sushi website. To grab food, move only chopstick 1. This reminds me of Natalie. She's on tour in Japan. And there's something else. I started Proust. François is right. It's very well written. And not that long actually. Everything is like before, with one small difference. I'm happy. Well, almost. More "happy" or more "almost"? More "almost happy", I think. "I think." All right, okay, positive. See you next Thursday. 300 euros. It wasn't 200 the last time? Chinese method: the better you feel, the more I charge. Does that work? Very well. Don't try politics. You'll be broke in no time. There. François? Nicolas, what a nice surprise. Capturing the event? For Isabelle's file. I'm helping her launch the campaign. I answer her email, file her clippings. I'm used to it. My real job is boosting female candidates. Job with a future. Isabelle, President. Presidente with an "e". What a story. I'm speechless, it's... Tectonic? That's it. Your aim was good. What a pity. We almost made it. Think so? We'd have eaten each other alive. Not necessarily. I'd never have abandoned you. Will she go all the way? No idea. You know Isabelle. She's determined. Not the case for everyone. But tenacity doesn't spell success. You must have noticed. Yes, it's true, tenacity is not enough. Neither is energy or willpower. Nor being agitated. Nor being moderate. Nor indecisive, nor lethargic. Anyway, whether she wins or loses, 5 years goes by fast. True, especially at the Elysée. In 5 years, François, you won't be that old. Nor will you, Nicolas. We'll meet again some day If you want to, as much as me Let's make a date One day, anywhere I promise I'll be there for sure "A man not involved in politics is not a peaceful citizen, but a useless one." Not from me either. Could've been though.
