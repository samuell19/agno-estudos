Where you going, huh? Huh? - Huh, huh? Where you going? Where you going, huh? - No. Where do you think you're going? Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I always thought you were better than us. Your father, all his little whores, with your little bastards. And you thought we were nothing but peasants. But we are Mexico. You were always ashamed of us. Now, I'm going to show you shame! You better open this door. Oh shit! Open the door. Uh! Where you going bitch, huh? Where you going? Where do you think you're going, huh? Huh? You think you could fuck with me? Huh? Is that what the fuck you think or what? Huh? Let me tell you something, man. Huh? You think I'm envious? Ah? Well, I'll tell you what, there's one thing I'm not fucking envious of and that's where I'm sending you! Right where the fuck you belong! That's right. Die! You're going to fucking feel the pain right now. - Stupid bitch, die! - [siren wailing] Fucking die! [siren approaching] [choking] Fucking die! [panting] [bell ringing] It's spring break weekend! ♪♪ [all cheering] You try that, you fuck out of here. What's up, player? There she come. What did you do baby boo? - Did you get the tickets? - Guess who went with that stupid ass hat? First class, baby. - Oh my god! How did you afford that? - Don't trip, man. After today, I'll be able to afford a lot of things. - What's up? You ready? - This girl with that stupid ass hat. I packed last night. - Pop the trunk. - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got mad shit in the trunk already just put this in the back. Yo, Jamal! - What's good? - You sure you and the homecoming queen won't change your mind? My pops is out of town this weekend, I'm throwing the biggest bash of the year. You'll tell your kids about it, brah. Let me think about this real brief. First-class tickets to Cabo and a spot on the beach, or hang out with your goofy ass and watch you pop Molly's all weekend and wonder why you can't get your shit up. - Why don't you blow me, man? - I don't know Jamal. If he's got what I think he's got, he might be getting some this weekend. You fucking tease. I know, right? Yeah, what you think K? You think we should dead this whole Cabo business - and hang with Brandon the BBLC crew? - Hmm, that's a toughy. Bye, Felipe. You heard her. That part. Bye, Felicia. Bye babe. Have fun. We love you. I hope your plane goes down in the Amazon common-looking anteater. Fuck you. Oh my god! We're going to have the best night. I'm literally so excited. - Do we have any alcohol? - Straight back, bitches! [girls screaming] [hip hop music playing] [siren wailing] Driver, do you know why I pulled you over? Would you believe I have a perfectly logical explanation for that, Officer? Since this is your first offense, Miss Gates, and since it was not your vehicle, and you claimed to have no knowledge of the contents of said vehicle, and you passed a polygraph test. That corroborates your statement. Now, the court would normally be inclined to be lenient in this matter. However, seeing as how the contraband was in such a large amount so as to fall into the category of intent to distribute and despite the council's familiarity with the court, I feel it's a part of my job when I pass a sentence. It is to help teach young people a lesson so this type of thing does not happen again. Are you with me? Therefore, I am sentencing you to three months of house arrest. Where you will be required to wear an ankle bracelet at all times to ensure you do not leave your parent's residence. Miss Gates, please understand that even though you have not been issued this ankle bracelet as of yet, confinement restrictions begin immediately. Are we clear? Yes, Sir. The court will schedule a time to apply the mandated monitoring device within five business days. Miss Gates, be mindful of who you associate with. It could cost you your freedom. However, in your case, Mr. Washington, the car you were driving was, in fact, your own, and you were driving under the influence of marijuana, the amount of marijuana found in the trunk of your vehicle was substantially more than enough to fall under the category of intent to distribute. Although you claimed that you too as well had no knowledge of what was in your vehicle. That would be of no concern to me in my court. "Why would that not matter in your courtroom, Your Honor?" I'll tell you why? I have no tolerance or patience for drug dealers, simple. And as far as I am concerned for first offense that just means you haven't been caught before. So, I am sentencing you to five years in the California State Penitentiary effective immediately. Your Honor, if we could beg the court for seventy-two-hour stay, so my client could get his house in order and say goodbye to his family, I assure you he's not a flight risk. Denied. Your Honor, I've known this young man all his life. I will sign for him myself and if it pleases the court, if he doesn't show up Monday, I will never come in this courtroom again. [chuckling] Councilor, are you threatening me with a two-for-one? Because if this means there's even the slightest chance that you're never walk into my courtroom again, I will take you up on that. Perhaps it might be worth it. Granted. Defender will appear Monday morning for processing at 7:00 a.m. Court is dismissed. Thank you, Your Honor. [lawyer] Come here, let's go. Uh, can't believe that asshole gave Jamal five years. I can't believe you're going to have a criminal record. Do you have any idea what an impact that's going to have on the rest of your life? Mom, it's nothing. It's just house arrest. Just admit it you're bummed because you might not be able to go to Miami with Ted. Uh, the hell I won't. You think your little trick is going to keep me from my trip in Miami? You have another thing coming. - But the judge just said... - I don't give a rat's ass about what the judge just said, you're on house arrest, not me. That stupid son of a bitch is not going to know where I go, but he will know where you go and so will I. - What do you mean? - Ted and I hired a live-in to keep an eye on you. Fresh off the boat from Mexico. How did you know I wasn't going to... I don't know, maybe go to jail? You need to wake up and smell the coffee, Kimmy. Everybody has a price. Even justice is for sale. You'll meet Sara in the house. Wait, so you're telling me you could have had Jamal's sentence reduced? And run the risk of you raising in a nappy haired little child? No chance. You know there's a word for people with a name like Jamal Washington, it rhymes with trigger. Wow. The only thing you're missing is a white sheet. Oh, don't play the race card with me missy. He's a drug dealer and jail is where drug dealers belong. So, you're going to be in Miami while I'm just stuck at home with a fricking live-in. I don't want to come home to a house that looks like Justin Bieber, Amanda Bynes and Miley Cyrus had a threesome in it. Oh, mom. Besides, it doesn't cost that much. They make like five dollars a month. She'll just be excited not to have to be selling oranges on the side of the 101 freeway. Mom, come on. You know I don't need a live-in. And you're not one to just bring in stray dogs from the street. She's not a stray dog, honey. She's a Mexican. You're the one who went to the dark side hanging out with Kanye. It's Jamal, mom. Whatever! You know as well as I do that once you go black, you're a single mom. Oh my god! Can you just take me home, please? I can't take your racist ass anymore. Oh, you're going home, sweetie. That's the only place you're allowed to be. Disrespectful little shit, trying to ruin my vacation. Mr. Gates, there's a call for you. Pastor Gates. Hi, daddy. Kimmy! One more, dad. Okay. One last time. Okay, Kim? What am I? [voice whispering] Charlie, Charlie. - What did you say to me? - Nothing. - Why you lying to me? - I'm not lying, dad. Oh, no. No. - No. - Dad? No, this can't be happening. - Dad what's wrong? - I thought I killed you. Mom, mom! - Honey, what's all the shouting about? - Something's wrong with dad. What do you mean something's wrong with dad? Look, something's wrong with him. Sweetheart, why don't you go up to your room and play a video game? I'll be there in just a minute, okay? - But mom, what about dad? - Sweetie, dad's going to be fine. - Go to your room. - Okay. Richard, who are you talking to? I will kill you. Kill who? Richard, you have to stop this. You're scaring Kim and you're scaring me. You've been strange ever since you came back from that trip to Mexico. - Honey. - What? Honey. Talk to me. Please. What's going on? Watch this bump here. [Kim] Mommy, where are they taking him? It's okay. [cop] Down on three. One, two, three. [Kim] When is he coming home? Honey, daddy has to go get better. He's coming for you. Daddy, who's coming? Evil. What evil? He's coming for you. What? You can only stop evil where the lines cross. What are you talking about? Where the lines cross. You can only stop evil where the lines cross. I don't understand. You can only defeat evil where the lines cross. Where the lines cross! Where the lines cross! You can only defeat evil where the lines cross! Where the lines cross! Mr. Gates, you're having a bit of an episode. I need you to calm down. Calm down. You're just having a bit of an episode. I'll take that. I'm so sorry, miss, your father's just having a bit of an episode. I've never heard him talk like that. I wouldn't take anything he's saying seriously. He's really not in a good place right now. He's never in a good place when he's in there. Poor daddy. Bitch! I saw you cheating. Stop playing with me! Oh my god. I'd never cheat. Why would you think I was cheating? Bitch! You're always cheating! I'm not a cheater. I... was... she-she... Oh my god. You see how white people treat us? Uh-huh, get off me. Uh-huh. Get off of me! [screaming] Kim, run! [distorted voice giggling] I'm coming for you. [praying] [cell phone ringing] Hello. I can't believe I'm going to be on house arrest all summer. What the fuck you mean house arrest? I was going to the NBA next year, now I'm about to do five fucking years up state in the pen. I know. I still can't believe it. When do you go in? That fat ass judge said I get processed on Monday. - Well that does still leave us the weekend, right? - I guess, babe. So, listen, I'm kind of fucked up right now, you know. Let's just make the best of the time we have. Still all I got is seventy-two hours. Well, you do you want me to give you something to remember me by right? I mean, I guess. You know I'll wait for you. We'll talk about that shit when I see you. - Yeah and that will be... - About an hour. - What? You're coming over? - Yeah, I got to run in, make it real quick and then I'm going to head over. Okay, yeah. Text me when you're outside. All right. For sure. Ugh! Well, that's one way to get likes. Oh my god, Ted. Can't you fucking knock? Ow! I'm not even looking. I can't even see anymore. Okay, listen. Your mom and I are going to Audi5000, okay? So I want you to meet the new live-in we got you. Oh, really? The live-in was your idea? You're not nervous that some strange bitch is going to be in our house and rob us blind? Okay, she's standing right here. She can hear everything you're saying. Come here, sweetheart. Come here, girl. Come here, honey. Okay, she's going to be watching over you for the weekend while we're gone. Sara. Are you fucking kidding me? This is our live-in, Ted? Back page? Back page? Tinder, okay? I swiped left twice and I found Sara. Okay, I'm lying. I was at Home Depot picking up some double-A batteries and some cock for your mother, all right. And then there was Sara. She said, "Hey." I said, "Sex." What a deal? Okay, so you guys get acquainted. All right. I'll let you guys finger, finger, finger it out. Finger her. I don't know how you say it in Spanish, I'll finger-ito, okay? Finger-ito? Ted, get the fuck out of my room! I'm going to Miami, okay? So, I'll see you guys later. All right? I'm going to turn up. We turn up. Bottle service, bitch! Woo! Daddy's on vacation. I can't. I fucking can't. I don't understand. - You can't do what? - Deal, bitch. I have some chick that should be working at a T-Bell, standing in my fucking room and you don't understand how this is awkward? Hurry up, Ted. We're losing light. Oh, goodbye, my little convict. Please don't burn my house down. Here's some money in case you need it. I should remind you, you have a curfew and confinement restrictions, but if you violate it you go to jail. So, I'm sure I don't need to. Love you. Mean it. Peace out, girl scout. Don't say that. Seriously? [bell ringing] Oh, my God. Jamal, I am so happy. - You actually came really... - Fast? Oh, my God. The word is fast, but, perhaps, I can introduce you to another word, "delivery", because in the next seventy-two hours you're going to have to face the fact that if you're not coming to Spring Break, Spring Break is coming to you. ♪♪♪ Brandon, what are you doing here and how did you not get caught by my mom and that perv?

Keep thinking I'm going to wake up and realize this is all a dream. I don't want to do this right now, okay? Let's just go meet everyone and we'll talk later. For right now, stay the fuck out of my face. - [Sean] Man, this sucks. What do we do now? - [Jamal] Man. punk-ass police always hanging sundown parties. Dude, they took my DJ equipment. We could play a game. Have you ever heard of "Charlie Charlie"? Play a game? My party's all-over fucking YouTube for being lame and you're talking about playing a game? Kim, it might actually be fun. Let's hear her out. I'm down. Fuck it, let's turn up. We have nothing else to do. I'm in. - Guys, where's Brandon? - Brandon is in the b... I'm going to go find Brandon. You know what? I'm going to help you. - What are you holding? - Nothing. Let me see it. The legend of Charlie is about the little boy who never went to church and because he never went to church and he hid from God his sins were never cleansed. So more and more as the years went by, he began to be consumed by all his sins, until one day, on his 13th birthday his soul was possessed by all seven of the deadly sins and he was driven mad forever. Even after his death, the local villagers would see signs of Charlie when the blue house would summon him. The legend says he waits for sinners to summon him so he can consume their souls with the poison of their own sin. Oh, I heard about this. It's that thing that was trending online, right? You guys, it's stupid. It's like the poor man's version of a Ouija board. No, it is a very serious thing in my country. Wow, and I thought this whole Charlie Charlie thing was just an Internet hoax. Apart from a hoax, if you break the rules of the game, Charlie will creep into the souls of all of you. Yeah, because Charlie's totally a demon. A Mexican demon, right? How do we play? Every one of us has a sin that dominates their personality. Envy, wrath, greed, sloth, gluttony, lust and pride. Seven deadly sins. The things we tried to stop ourselves from doing, but can't seem to control. When the soul of Charlie is summoned, the challenge begins. Overcome your sin or be consumed by it. Okay, what happens if you overcome it? Charlie takes it from you. His soul bears the weight of it in purgatory and you're free from that sin forever. - Wow. - That's cool. Okay. What happens if you don't? You die from it. Come on, man. That's bullshit. Of course, it's total bullshit. But, honestly, kind of sounds fun and plus what else are we going to do? Hey, I'm not the one on house arrest. I can leave whenever the fuck I want. Okay, well I want to be free from all my food cravings. What's that, gluttony? If I can get rid of that shit, I'm game. Let's play. What are the rules? Rule number one, you need seven players to play. One for every sin. I guess that makes sense. Well, there's seven of us, looks like we have just enough. Eight of us. Guys, I may be higher than shit, but I'm Asian. I'm good at math. There's eight of us here. No, Young there are seven of us. You don't fucking count. Go get us some food. What do you guys want? - Fries. - Sushi! Chicken. - Spaghetti. - Yo, fuck that. Get us Chinese food. Yes! Hey, that's racist, but I could go for orange chicken. I'll be right back, guys. I'm going to get a whole platter of all orange chicken, Chow Mein, and fortune cookies. They're going to say, "Suck on his Chinese nuts." Does this fucker realize he's not wearing any pants? [scoffs] Rule number two, you can only ask yes or no questions. Rule number three, don't ever drop the pencils while you're playing. - How come? - Oh my god, give me this. Um, okay rule number three, don't let the pencils hit the ground cause if they do the game cannot end. Okay, well what if you want the game to end? I mean, what if you don't want to start it at all? You can only leave the game if you ask permission. [imitating female voice] OMG, guys, I'm like so freaking scared right now. Ooh, evil spirits. Oh, no! They're coming for your ass first. And they're going to meet me in your mama's house, bro. Okay, guys. Number four, you must always, always, ask permission to leave the game. And if you don't? All right, guys, I don't know that this is such a good idea. I mean summoning evil spirits and everything, come on. Oh my god, Laurie. Shut the fuck up. Oh, come on. Let's just play. We need to hold hands and I will say this phrase. "Death is struck and nature quaking. All creation is awakening. Whatever heights will appear, God becomes evil, faith becomes fear." - [Kim] What the fuck? - No way. - Did you see that see that? - See what? These nuts? Got him. Come on, the wind blew it. What wind, bro? There's no wind in here. - [imitating wind] - Really? Jamal, stop. I'll go first. Charlie, Charlie. Can you hear me? Charlie, Charlie. Are you here? You guys don't really believe in this shit, are you? I believe in spirits. Yeah, and you still believe in fucking Santa Claus. Wait, you fucked Santa? Ho, ho, ho. It has begun. Remember, overcome your sin or die from it. [Jamal] R? - What the fuck you mean? - All right, I'm about done with this. Yeah, I second the shit out of that motion. Fellas, chill. I got a yes-or-no question. Hey, yo, Charlie. - Do I die tonight? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Why the fuck would you ask that? - Fuck. Yo, babe, stop being so naive. The only thing that's really going on right now is we're sitting here talking to a couple of fucking pencils. You expect me to be afraid of a ghost named fucking Charlie? That's a Mexican? A Mexican ghost? I mean, come on, really? Maybe if his name was like Carlos or Pablo and Dirty Sanchez or some shit like that I'd understand, but fucking Charlie, Charlie? Yo, call me ghostbusters, bitches, but I ain't afraid of no ghost. Boo! I hate you fucking people. You know what? Fuck this. I'm done with this shit. You have no idea what you have just done. [Sean] Five motherfucking years? - I mean, damn! - I know. My ass hurts just thinking about it. Shut the fuck up, pussy cloud. Do you guys know where Jamal's at? Bro, there ain't nothing I could do about that. But what I can do is make this weekend worth something. [Brandon] Oh! Take a whiff of that shit. Guys, where's Jamal? I don't know, they're probably smoking weed or something. Ooh, that's hemp. Okay, I say roll this shit up, dawg. I'm gonna go backwards, bro, it's good. Do you guys really think I look like Kim Kardashian? Yeah. [taking pictures] I think Laurie's going to give me some play, bro. - What do you think? - Is she really a virgin? - I don't know, but hey, Sean, what you think? - Couldn't do it, dawg. That bitch is insecure and shit. [Brandon] Yo, the insecure bitches like Laurie, them the biggest freaks, though. Yo, take this. Yo, that shit is some kill 'cause I'm tweaking. Yo, pass that shit. [Sean] I told you. Oh shit. What's good? Yo, fellas, I got some business to tend to. So, um, I'm gonna see you two ladies a little later. Anybody get no buns, Captain Drydick. Bang, bang, bang. [giggling] Yo, man, what I'm doing? Matter of fact, it's about that time. Well. There you go, player. I'm about to go upstairs with Kim. About to make it wobble wobble and drop it like a sire. Do your thing. Lightweight. Just you and me, beautiful. Got your message, girl. Now, I was wondering when you're gonna stop playing these games with me. What's with the silent treatment? Oh, now that's what I'm talking about. Oh yeah. Ow! What the fuck? Bitch, what the fuck? Oh! [chuckling] Wow. You really hit like a bitch. Open the fucking door. Fuck. [Sean] Whoa, whoa, why are you yelling? Dude, you're not gonna believe what the fuck just happened to me. Yo, you're bleeding. - What happened? - Laurie. That bitch fucking tried to kill me. What the fuck are you talking about? She's been with us for like the past hour. No, she texted me about meeting her at the pool. Then that bitch went fucking crazy and stabbed me. Okay, dude, you're fucking high. Show me the text. Fuck. What the fuck? I swear I fucking had it. Brandon, when did you get here? Oh, is that blood? Yo, bro, what the fuck did you do to your arm? Does this fucking look like I did this shit to myself? Something's not right here, man. I'm getting something to clean that up. Bro, Laurie's been here with us the entire time. That shit we smoked early got you tweaking, B. Wait, are you saying that I did this to you? Something is wrong here, bro. This is serious. Maybe we get the fuck out of here. Dude, just relax. That's your problem, you're too relaxed. Are you guys not fucking listening to me? Something is not right here. We need to get the fuck out of here. What the fuck? - What? - Rachel. What? I'm hungry. You smell good. Okay, somebody get her away from me before I have to drop-kick this bitch tonight. Damn, Jess. Why are you so hostile? Okay, you're the last person that can even say shit to me. Hey, wait, where are you going? Didn't I tell your ass to step off? Why don't you go talk to JLo? Fuck you. You are such an ass, Jamal. Damn, bro. Fuck this shit, man. This is my last weekend. I'll be damned if I'm living myself to just one piece of ass. - You smell me? - No. Hating is bad for your health, shorty. Whatever. Yeah, I'm out of here, man. Whatever. This is one fucked-up weekend. I'm gonna go smoke some more. - [knocking door] - [Kim] Go away, Jamal. It's me, Rachel. Can I come in? I was just wanted to come in and check in on you. No. I'm fine, I'm just... I hate when he fucking does that. It makes me so crazy. Like... look at me. You know I'm smart, got a great sense of humor, I'm loyal and I got a tight ass body, like, who wouldn't want this? Flawless. Yes, you are. You know, the only thing Jamal cares about is trying to fuck burrito belly and, well, whoever else he can stick his dick into. It's okay. Don't give Jamal another thought. Just breathe. Whoa, whoa. [chuckles] Rachel, what are you doing? What are you, like, gay or something? No, silly, I'm not gay. I'm just hungry. [biting] Goddamn it, Rachel. - What the fuck girl? - She attacked me. Look at my fucking leg. Bitch tried to chew it off. See? I told y'all some crazy shit going on here. Now I'm out of here. - [Jamal] Yeah, I'm going. Let's go. - Okay. [Rachel softly] Help me. Please help me. - Why are you just standing there? - You can't leave. You have to finish the game. Does it look like we want to play a fucking game right now? I'm out. - Come on bro, let's speed out of here, man. - But I can't open it. You have to finish the game. Look, bitch, whatever voodoo-type shit you're trying to pull, you better knock the fuck right now. - Jess, stop! - You have to finish the game. [phone ringing] Hello? [child's voice] ♪ Charlie, Charlie, Charlie ♪ ♪ Will you play with Charlie? ♪ ♪ Ashes, ashes They all fall down ♪ How's that possible? Go check the fucking windows, all of them. It's not me, it's Charlie. Okay, enough of this fucking Charlie bullshit, okay? Whatever the fuck you put in Rachel's drink that made her lose her mind and go all Hannibal Lecter on us, yeah, you can bet the police are gonna fucking hear about this. So I suggest you go upstairs and pack your fucking bags and head for the fucking border. Comprende? Repent your sins or die from them. Can you believe that? That bitch still won't leave. - Why don't you just call the fucking police? - That's a good idea. Hey, do you guys have reception? No, I got no signal. No, I know I had a signal earlier. You know, I'm getting really sick of this shit, honestly. I think I left my phone upstairs, I will be right back, okay? [exhaling] Fucking disgusting. Let's call a housekeeper. What the fuck? [dropping cell phone] What the fuck? [screaming] What the fuck? Do you enjoy being this pathetic? No. Then why don't you do something about it? Let's face it, Laurie, you will never be as pretty as Kim. You'll never be as badass as me. You're not shapely. You're not funny. You're not strong. You have no talent. You're barely just getting by. Do you really want to live like this? No. No? Down, not across. [crying] Charlie's here. Okay, bitch, we don't need to hear that right now. Yo, B, why don't you go upstairs and see if Laurie found her phone? Hell no. - What the fuck you mean no? - What, you still think Laurie was the one who attacked you? Oh wait, let me guess, it was Charlie. There's no time for jokes now, Kim. Shit ain't right. Man, can you go see if she found her phone, please? Go. All right, man. Geez! - You can do it. - I can't. - I can't. - Fuck it. I'll do it. [knocking on door] Laurie, it's Brandon. Are you in there? Yeah. - Well, they sent me... - Sent you what? They sent me up here to see if you had found your phone and if you had signal. Yeah, got my phone. I haven't checked for a signal yet. Do you wanna check? Brandon, is something wrong? Wrong? Not exactly wrong per se. You know I always wanted you, right? Why didn't you ever make that move then, huh? You're always with your cheering squad. Could never get my turn. What the hell is going on here? It's Charlie. There's definitely something wrong here. I agree. Rachel, who we've all known since elementary school just tried chewing off my fucking leg. I knew something was wrong the minute she started drinking and eating chips. We all know Rachel never eats chips. And Brandon claimed that Laurie tried to kill him. None of this shit's making any sense. Charlie's putting all of you against the other through the game. Can't trust nobody. And we are all locked in this motherfucker like animals in a cage. You have to finish the game. Enough with the game bullshit, people are dying here. You have to repent your sins. Repent? Repent? All this crazy shit started happening the minute your ass walked into my goddamn house. That's true. Stay the fuck away from me, Sara. I need a smoke. You guys, what's keeping Brandon and Laurie? Let me go check on them. [Laurie] Brandon. - What? - Stop. - Stop what? - Stop trying to have sex with me, I'm not ready. I feel like you're ready to me. - Brandon, I'm serious. - Me too. Come on, it's not like we're gonna do anything. Okay. Jamal. Wait a minute. Didn't you die? It's the house, Jamal. Nothing is as it seems. None of this is real. Come with me. Bitch, where? What about this Charlie, Charlie shit? Just a silly game. So what do you want to do with me? Come with me. - What are you doing? - Quit being a fucking tease. [Laurie] Stop it! Brandon! You're hurting me! [screaming] Take off your clothes. I thought I wouldn't get some. - What the fuck, yo? - [machine turning on] No, fuck. Let me out! Help! Please let me out! Ugh! What is that god-awful smell? Smells like burnt flesh. Oh my god, Laurie. What happened? You're all so fucking fake. The designer clothes, expensive purses. You don't care about me. We do care. Jasmine. You told me that I was weak and that I was pathetic and then you gave me a knife to cut my own fucking wrist. None of that ever happened, Laurie. I love you. Laurie, we all love you. You know that. You know we care. Bullshit! BBOC is all you care about, bad bitches of Cally. And the only reason that you included me in your group right? Was so that I could do your work, and you could cheat off me. Because you're both so fucking brain dead. Okay, none of what you're saying is making any sense. And Brandon. He raped me! You knew I was a virgin, right? He took that from me. I feel stupid. So fucking stupid. Okay, Laurie, just.... Laurie. Laurie. Laurie, no! No! - Oh my god! - Jas, cover it! [Jasmine] Oh my God. Tell me I'm pretty. You are. You're beautiful. Yeah, you are. Oh my God. [Kim] Laurie. Laurie. Oh! Oh my God. Oh my God. Is she dead? You have to finish the game. We're getting taken over by our sins. - If we don't finish this, we'll never be able to... - Repent. Fuck your stupid game! I'm going to look for Jamal. [screaming] Jamal's dead. What? How? He burnt up in the sauna. Where'd that fucking gun come from? My mom keeps it under her pillow. Thought you said the room upstairs with the sauna had no electricity. It doesn't. Okay, well if anyone of you comes near me, I will fucking kill you. We have to move now. You're all running out of time. We have to finish the game. So how are you doing it, huh? Invisible strings? Magnets? Tell me. I don't think it's a trick. No, that's what she wants you to think. She wants you to buy in all this Charlie Charlie bullshit. You need to wake up to the reality of what's happening right now. More of us will die if you don't. What were the rules again? Yes or no questions. Don't ever drop the pencils. You need permission to leave. Well we already broke one. You can thank Laurie for that. Yeah, except she's dead. So we can't. We have to play the game. Okay? We have to play the game. Whoa. Did you just see that? What? Something just ran by. We're running out of time. Look, I'm not playing this shit again. That's what caused this crazy shit in the first place. Enough of this bullshit. We're doing this. I'd rather die. That's on you then. I'm in. [Sean] Me, too. Death is struck, and nature quaking, all creation is awaking, whatever hides will appear. Good becomes evil. Fuck this shit! Faith becomes fear. God, I'm done with this stupid ass game! We have to finish the game. That bitch is fucking crazy. I saw something. Sean? I'm not fucking crazy. [Sean grunting] Okay, Sean, this is so not funny. [coughing] Oh my God! Time to pop a cap. Let's go purge on this bitch. Jas, the bitch dies tonight, got it? [Sara] You have to finish the game. Bitch! [baby babbling] Did you hear that? - What is that? - I don't know. I'll check it out. It's just your supply closet. Jas! [Sara] You still don't get it. You don't understand. No, bitch, you don't understand. [distorted voice] You should have listened to her. [chuckling] Well played. Who the fuck are you? Charlie, Charlie, bitch. Alive and well. Actually dead and well. You get the point. Poor Sara. The only one to ever escape the game alive. She was actually here to help you. But you guys didn't listen and now she's dead because of you guys' sins. Life's a bitch, isn't it? No. She was trying to kill us. No, she was trying to warn you. Oh God, where did you go? [Charlie chuckling] Come find me. Kim? Is that you? No. But it's time for you to get reunited with some old friends. What's wrong, Jas? Not happy to see me? None of you are real. None of this is real. We are real, Jasmine. [Brandon] As real as it gets. And I'm still hungry. Get away from me. - No! No! Help me! - [giggling] One more to go. Fuck. [Kim panting] [distorted whispering] - Oh... - [gasping] Where's she? What did you do with Jasmine? Oh, she stopped to catch up with some old friends. [giggling] You sick twisted freak. Kim, do you ever wonder why your dad abandoned you? You don't know shit about my father and I know he'd never abandoned me. He's not in an institution. He died five years ago. Remember the last night you ever spoke to him? They say he died, he'd escaped at night. But we both know better, huh. Go to hell, Charlie. Home sweet home. Let's play the game. [laughing] [Charlie] Tic, toc... Kim. Oh, your poor daddy. Had so much fun killing him. Kim. What about the love of your life? What about Jamal? He burned so good. [giggling] Oh, oh, and Laurie. The coward didn't wait for me to kill her. To cut her throat open, huh? You're closer, Kim. Oh, Jasmine. She tasted so good. [Richard] You can stop evil where the lines cross. Where the lines cross! You can only stop evil where the lines cross! You can only defeat evil where the lines cross! Where the lines cross! Where the lines cross! You can only defeat evil where the lines cross! Where the lines cross, what does that even mean? [Charlie] Over here, Kim. Let's play the game. Kim. We're all waiting for you. Are you excited? Come play with me. I feel alone. Let's play together. I'm sorry, you're going to have to end up like everybody else. Come here, Kim. I'm waiting. [giggling] Let's be alone. Wait. Oh, my God. We played with two pencils. Dad. Daddy, I remember the words you taught me. First John 4:4. "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world." One more, dad. [Richard] What am I? What am I? Through the blood of Jesus Christ I am redeemed out of the hand of the devil and all my sins are forgiven. The blood of Jesus Christ is cleansing me from all of my sins. Father in Heaven, in the name of Jesus I believe that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and rose again from the dead. I confess all my sins and repent. I forgive everyone who has ever hurt me. I transfer all pain, abandonment, betrayal and abuse to the cross of Jesus Christ. Father, please forgive me for my sins. Found you. Game over, bitch. I am justified and made righteous just as if I had never sinned. I'm set apart for God. God doesn't play this game. He's too busy. I believe he's gonna meet me in heaven. A pathetic game. Let's have some real fun. [giggling] Ugh! My body is a temple for the Holy Spirit, redeemed and cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, body, soul and spirit. I belong to Jesus now. [Charlie screaming] You can only defeat evil where the lines cross. No, no, no. No. Are you okay? [panting] Young, I'm telling you it's not gonna open. We tried that earlier. That did not work. Look, you're... you're safe now. Everything's gonna be okay. No, it's not. Laurie is dead, Jamal is dead. They are all dead. Okay. Don't go back in. Please, don't go back. I'm gonna go back and check to see if anybody's still alive. - Hey, hey... - No, Young, we can just leave right now. I've got this under control. Young's got this. Know what? Fuck this, I'm done with this shit. You have no idea what you have just done. Kill that one for me. Help! Please let me out! [Sean] Shit! Should have listened to her, bro. You see my point?
