We always love to do it, but I am so, so grateful that you all are here again, so I just want to say happy Thanksgiving. - Happy Thanksgiving! - Happy Thanksgiving! - Cheers! - Thank you all for being here. You outdid yourself again this year. Looks good. That Turkey is better than last year, and I don't even know how that's possible. I'll tell you. The secret is in the brining. Jill's not looking for a recipe. She's just happy we get to come here every year so she doesn't have to cook. Ah-hah! I love it. The more, the merrier here. I'm already planning my Christmas menu. It's true, it's true. She starts planning the holidays during, what, labor day? Oh, come on. Do you think I, uh... Get a little carried away? Maybe just a tad? "A tad"? Are you kidding me? Come on! Come December, you are like Santa on steroids. I love it, though. I do. All the cooking and the baking and... The decorating, the shopping. The caroling, the eggnogging. Not to mention single-handedly mounting the school's Christmas spectacular every year. - Mm-hmm. Every year. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you! Uh-oh... Make your fun. Make your fun. We know you do, honey. We love you for it. Nobody does Christmas like you do. - Nobody! - Mm-mm. And that's how you earned the nickname of "Christmas Carol" down at the school. Okay. Okay. This is the last of the lot. Whew! You know what? I actually think we set a new speed record this go-around unpacking. Well, this isn't our first time at the rodeo. What's this, the third time in two years? Yeah. And I know it's not always easy, kiddo. But, at least with this hotel project that I'm supervising, we're gonna be here for at least a year. In that case, let's hang a few pictures on the wall. - Good idea. - Yeah. What do you got there? Oh, yeah... Ahh. You know, mom, she loved a flocked Christmas tree. You know what... That's what we need to do this year... Put up a tree! We need something to warm up this temporary-rental decor. You... are absolutely right. We're gonna get a tree this year. And you know what else is gonna happen this year? We are gonna spend some quality time together, just me and you, this holiday season. That is a promise. I'll believe it when I see it. Well, you believe it, kiddo. Oh! Dinner's here, finally. All right. I got it. Hi. I got a... "Thanksgiving special" for Terry Evans. Yeah, that's me. - Here you go. - Awesome. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving. - Take care. - Yeah. Ooh... hey. Here we go. Here we go! Ohh... What's Thanksgiving at the Evans' home without a large veggie pizza with Turkey sausage? Hey! Count your blessings, kiddo. I had to call all over town to find a pizza place that was still open! All right... who's ready to carve the first slice? Me! I'm going in. Okay. Mm! Yum! Who needs Turkey, right? All right. I even put the cranberry in a separate dish, so it won't spill. Wow! Good. Well, with any luck, we will be eating right through to the end of February. Isn't that a good thing? Honey, do you think that maybe you're still cooking for your ex-husband and your in-laws? What... What're you talking about? I've been divorced four years. I know. Look, here's an idea. How about just cutting the recipes in half? And, I don't know, maybe think about getting back out there? We've already had this conversation. No thanks. Oh, come on! Why not? Look, you have so much to offer! There is more to life than being a real estate agent and "super mom." Have you ever heard the phrase "once bitten, twice shy"? Yeah, and how about "love is lovelier the second time around"? Oh... ugh! I like my life the way that it is. Okay. Okay! You know what? Your b.F.F. Will m.Y.O.B. For now. - Thanks. - Yeah. Well, Carol, you did it again! Well, well, that's my job! Thank you so much for a fantastic meal. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. You too, Bryan! Thanks, principal Higgins. Dude, you don't have to call him that outside school. Right! Okay, so are we doing the open house at the MacKenzie place on elm? What are you talking about? It's gonna be looky-loos. I'm gonna have a chance to finish my Christmas cards. - "Finish"? Honey! - Goodnight! Okay. Love ya. - See ya. - Thanks for dinner. Thank you! Wait, you do realize it's still Thanksgiving, right? Only for a few more hours. Oh, boy. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. I blame it on the elves. Well, that's my story. I'm sticking to it. I've never seen it that busy. Wow. I'll get it! - Black Friday... - It's packed. Amateurs. I avoided "black Friday" shopping by doing mine online. Yes! She's good. Real good. Yeah. I mean, who'd want to be out there in that? This is ridiculous. Come on, let's...! Dad, it's not their fault. There's nowhere to go. Well... I mean, look at this. Should we, uh, just turn around, and try this another day? What do you think? No, I need new clothes for school on Monday. It's bad enough starting a new school mid-year. Well, by the time we get into this parking lot, it may actually be next year. I... Then, um, why don't you just drop me off here and pick me up in a few hours? What? Come on, I thought we were gonna spend some time together. We did. Sitting in traffic. Oh... Well, that's great, that's great quality time there. Come on, dad. I need a new look. You need a new look, huh? Mm-hmm. Of course you do. You're gonna kill me, you know that? All right, just... Go easy. I'm still paying off your last look. Easy. Okay. I'll see you later. All right. Thanks. Love you. Yeah, yeah, love you, too. - Bye! - Bye. You know what the worst part about long weekends is? The Monday following. Have you seen my keys? We're going to be late, which means I'll be the new kid who walks into class with every head turning around and staring at her. At least it'll give everyone a chance to admire your new outfit. Relax! All right? I'm gonna get you there before the bell rings because I have the keys! All right, hair and makeup on the way. - Okay. - Chop-chop. Let's go. Can you guess? Can you guess what we're doing here? Come on. Let's go! What're we doing here? I'm gonna be late for school. No, no, you're gonna be fine. I left the house a couple minutes early. Are you taking them in? Take them in. Pick it out. We gotta go fast! No. I gotta be going to school right now. Honey... You're gonna be so tickled when you see what just came in. Well, then you've got the blue nobles? Oh! Shipped in fresh this morning. I'm not gonna put these puppies out until the older ones sell, but... You can have the pick of the litter. See that? That's how you get the best Christmas tree! All right, just swing your end over here. All right. And... one! Two! Three! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas... ♪ Please hurry. I hate being late. I know, I know. I know. Me too. We're fine. Well, you know, honey, it is your last year at middle school, so I was hoping that you would grace the stage with a little saxophone solo for the Christmas spectacular. Mm. Let me go with my pat answer of years past... No! No. And I don't think so. Perfect. I'll take it as a yes. You know I don't like being the center of attention. I know, but you're so good. You're a member of the band. Yeah, where I'm surrounded by other instruments. Strength in numbers. Well... I hope you'll reconsider. I just hope you lower your expectations. Never. Hold on. I'll make the light. Watch out! There we go! Made the light! See, mom? That's how you destroy a Christmas tree. Oh! Don't forget your sax. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Good morning. Welcome to Brookswood, Amelia! Home of the bobcats! Now, I know mid-year transfers can be a little difficult, but we're gonna do everything we can to make the transition as painless as possible. Thank you. No tests or pop quizzes? Ha, ha. Can't blame her for trying, right? I'm afraid that's out of my jurisdiction. Okay, homeroom is 215 and... it starts in about three minutes, so you better get a move-on. All right, I'll walk you over. And hold my hand? Dad, I'm 14. I think I'm good. Really? Okay. I'll see you after school, then. Bye. Have a good one. What's, uh... The meeting about? Today is the start of the holiday kick-off here at Brookswood. There is a lot to do. But, lucky for me, there is a "super mom" here on campus and she takes care of a lot of the heavy-lifting. I see. Merry Christmas! You're new here! Uh, yes. Amelia Evans. Well, merry Christmas! Thank you. Merry Christmas. You! You headed to the PTA meeting? What are you talking about? That's my last Christmas spectacular, it's gonna be the best one ever! Why do you put so much pressure on yourself? You're like a category-five hurricane, ooh, with candy canes. Yeah. These aren't just for students, right? Well... I mean, why? I didn't have breakfast. Eat five. A big round of applause for Carol Montgomery for helping revive the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony. Right? It's been fun. Thank you guys for all if your help. Great. I don't know where you find such boundless energy and enthusiasm, but I'm glad you do. As are the rest of us! Always flattering me. Please go on. And now to discuss the upcoming Christmas spectacular, the very same Carol Montgomery. It just gets boring, doesn't it? Hey, you guys, I am so grateful you're here again this year. It's gonna be the best one ever. Sorry! Door... I didn't, uh... Is, uh... Is this the PTA? It is, it is, come on in. Okay. I'm sorry! Hello. I'm sorry. Welcome. Do you want to grab a seat? Yes. Okay. You do have a child here? Guilty as charged. Have a seat. Uh, thank you. Sorry I'm late. No problem, no problem. We were talking about the Christmas spectacular. We do it here every year. This one is gonna be better than ever. Okay. I think we're just gonna go with the traditional that we always do, the holiday classics sung by our fantastic winter choir. Does anybody object? Yes? I'm sorry, I missed your name. Evans. Evans. Evans. Yes. Uh, well, I was just listening to you there, and it sounds, to me, like maybe you're kind of doing the same show year after year, and I just wondered would it be fun to try something different? - Well... - Try something new? We've been getting better year after year, of course. I mean, being that it's something that we all look forward to, that's been doing very well for us, I don't really see any need to, you know, shake that tree. Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the Christmas classics as much as the next person, I just wondered, since it is called the "Christmas spectacular," you know, to an outsider, it sounds like maybe it's becoming a little "ho-ho-hum"? "Ho-ho-hum"? You haven't even seen it! What'd you have in mind, Mr. Evans? Oh! I don't know. Let me think. Uh, I mean, just off the top of my head, how about... hey! How about a holiday talent show? That would be something new for our kids to throw themselves into, right? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And break the hearts of our beloved winter choir? No, no, no! Nobody would be excluded. No, let's turn the spectacular into a Christmas-themed variety show. Everybody's welcome! You do know that Christmas is about honoring the traditions of years past? Says... who? Says tradition. And what about new traditions? I-i-I'm sorry. I... I so don't mean to challenge you. I'm just spit-balling here. I don't know. It's silly. No, no, no, we love a good spit-ball. Glad you said that! Because, um, I think some of Mr. Evan's ideas have merit. Sure. Jugglers. What do we get next? Go-go dancers? Rappers? Mimes? Look, if it would help, I would be happy to volunteer. I'd like to volunteer. Carol, where's your welcoming spirit? No, like, uh... I mean, we would love volunteers. I don't know if you know what's involved in it. I mean there are a lot of rehearsals first, and then... well, you know, you have the auditions, of course, leading up to those, and, um... You know what? I promised my daughter I'd get more involved in school this year, so... What the hey? I'm in, if you'll have me! All right! That's settled! This year's Christmas spectacular has found itself a new co-chair! Yeah! Oh, no, excuse me, Mr. Evans? Oh, no, please, call me Terry. - Terry. - Yeah. I'm Carol Montgomery. I have a son in the eighth grade, Bryan. Hi, Carol. I've got a daughter, Amelia, same grade. Yes, yes, yes! I met that beautiful girl in the hallway. I hope you don't think I was too stiff back there. I-I just... I'm not used to fathers being so eager to get involved. Carol, I get it. Believe me, okay? I mean, I've been a backseat dad most of my life, and then that's kind of why I'm getting involved, to try and help out here. Just... Okay. I guess we have our work cut out for us to make something really special. I guess we'll be seeing a lot of each another, in that case. Apparently. Oh! Yeah? Is something the matter? I just wish I knew the joker who drove this car. He cut me off this morning on the way to school. What? Yeah. That... that is... That is terrible. Uh... I mean, I'm sure whoever this joker is, I mean, they... It was unintentional. Well, I'm sure that's easy for you to say. You weren't the one that had to slam on the brakes, while your perfect Christmas tree fly into the intersection, get trampled by a semi. Killed my noble! That's not right. No. Out-of-state plates. Yeah. Yeah. This wouldn't happen to be your car, would it? Carol, Carol, I was running late this morning. We had to go through the thing, and I had no idea of what happened. Just when we were starting to have things get a little less awkward between us, Terry. That's beautiful. That's, uh... What do you think? He's married? Well, he wasn't wearing a ring. Yeah, but I don't really think that means anything anymore. You don't have to wear a ring. Really? Everyone who's married wears a ring, no? Yeah, well, you and I do, but I don't know that everybody... Let's get to work! We have, what, about a hundred programs to fix for the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony, so that should go quickly. What? Oh, no. I'm not gossiping, guys. We have a task at hand. Let's do it. We're surprised you held it together for the PTA meeting this morning. Come on. I don't own Christmas around here. Uh, well, not officially, okay? But we all kind of assumed that you had a lease with an option to buy. I'm sorry, are we gonna talk about how good-looking he is? Did you see those eyes? Right? And the jaw line. And the height. Perfect for... Yes! For her! That's what I was thinking. He's volunteering so that he can be with his daughter. He said so himself. I think it's a... I think it's a super idea. Okay, honey, you know what? Let's just leave this thing alone for a little while. We still have a lot of programs to make. I'm not even upset that he's going to join the festivities. I'm more upset that he cut me off this morning with his car and my tree went into the intersection! Think he's got a nice car? Did you notice his style? Do you think he's got a good job? Oh, and the way he talks about his daughter. Do you think he recycles? Do you think he's single? He wasn't wearing a ring! Even though we don't start demo of the old city library until the first of the year, I've got quotes on electrical and plumbing coming in before the holidays. That's good to hear. Yeah. Because I do want to give you the head's up... We may have to move up the timeline on construction. Why? What's going on? A possible legal snag. I should have more news by tomorrow. But this could be a working holiday. Look... I know you've been gunning for that permanent position at head office. Yeah. Only for the last four years now. Any word from your end? Not yet, but I do know that all eyes are on the success of this hotel. Right. Well... Guess I'll just have to make sure we deliver at my end, won't I? Good to hear. Talk to you soon. Sorry. What's this? "Christmas tree-lighting ceremony." Yeah. Thanks. Just helping my mom. Oh, so you must be Christmas Carol's son? Yep. Bryan Montgomery. And you really don't have to call her that. Amelia Evans, a.k.a. The new kid at Brookswood. So how are you finding it? So far, it feels like I'm sinking into a quicksand of midterms. You know, my friend, Nelson, he just started a study group, if you want to come join us. A study group is exactly what I need right now. And a new member to keep our noses out of the game box and in our books is exactly what we need right now. Okay. I'll see you later. Great. See you. So? How was your first day? It fell somewhere between buffalo and Pittsburgh. But Pittsburgh was definitely the worst. What was so wrong with Pittsburgh? Don't you remember? I had "mean Mrs. Matheson" for homeroom and got stuck sitting between the tussling Taylor twins for the whole year. Right! I forgot about that. Well, in that case, today was definitely a very Pittsburgh- worthy day for me. Oh, what? What did you do? Tell me you didn't embarrass me. Why do you immediately go to the "embarrass me" place? Huh? I could've had a flat tire, a parking ticket. You don't know. Because I've never once seen you get a flat or a parking ticket. Smarty-pants. No, I just, uh... I had a little bit of a run-in with the queen bee of the PTA, that's all. Wait a minute. That was us that cut Mrs. Montgomery off this morning? You heard about that today at school? Some of the kids were talking about it at lunch. Everyone calls her "Christmas Carol," so, basically, you made enemies with the nicest mom at Brookswood. So I guess this means you'll be downgrading your day even further? Not yet. I just met her son and he let me join his study group for upcoming midterms. Oh, yeah? Yeah, another fun part about always having to move on the fly. I'm sorry, kiddo. I know. No, it's okay. It's all right. Once I get this promotion, though, we're going to have that permanent home we've always wanted. "Senior construction supervisor." Huh? I can feel it. Me too. And, until then, maybe you can help me memorize all of the symbols of the periodic table. Do I have to? Do I have to? I don't want to. Of course. Of course. But you know what? Before we do that, I think, you and I, we need a little stress reliever. Get in. Okay. Ooh! Time flies. Feels like we were just here. Very funny. Where's Clyde? Oh, hey, I forgot to tell you... I volunteered for the school Christmas spectacular this morning. Seriously? Yeah. Your idea of school participation is usually dropping me off in the morning. Hey, I'll tell ya, this dad just got an upgrade. In fact, it's a whole new operating system, what do you think of that? Okay. All right. Let's see if this tree is ready for us. What happened to the nobles? This morning, there was a whole truck full! What happened to the one I sold you? W-Well... It sort of blew off. Yeah, yeah. And now it's roadkill. A bit of an incident. Why don't we just buy that one there? Looks the exact same. Are you kidding? That's a Scottish pine! What's the difference? The difference? A noble is far superior. It keeps its fragrance, its color, and i-i-i-it lasts... Okay, okay, let's forget I asked! Forget I asked. Sure you don't have another one? No, I'm sorry, I just sold the last one... To him. Hey, Carol! Terry. You flocked my noble? Uh... I don't know about that, but isn't this a beauty? Hey, Clyde, thanks so much, this is exactly what I wanted. This flocking looks amazing. Well, merry Christmas, everyone! I hope you get what you're after. Okay. Bye. A little to the left. Perfect! Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah! That was a great idea, kiddo. That really warms up the room. Just wait until we decorate it. You'll need to pick up some ornaments since our things are in storage. Right. Will do. Okay, so have you thought about dinner? I don't know. Have you thought about how you're gonna make up with Christmas Carol? Ohh! How was I supposed to know that she had a special arrangement with the owner? Huh? I mean, I was just trying to be nice. Don't get me wrong, dad, I love you to bits, but sometimes, you can be a bull in a China shop. Oh, really? Well, you shouldn't underestimate me, because this dad knows how to extend an olive branch... And in this case, one with lots and lots of pine needles. Clyde? What are you doing here? You know that guy that flocked your tree? He came back to the lot and he got you this. Said he felt guilty about buying the last blue noble. He left this card. I tried telling him you're the kind of lady that likes to pick out her own tree, but he was mighty insistent. That's, uh, kind. Want me to haul it inside? No, no. No, no. Um... Just leave it there. I think I have an idea for it. You want me to give you a call when the next batch of blue nobles come in? Oh, I'd love it. I'll give you some pumpkin-nut bread in exchange. Bribes are always appreciated. Um, uh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. You wouldn't happen to have his address, would you? Honey, can you get that? Yeah. For sure. Mrs. Montgomery! Come in. Thank you. Oh, I just wanted to welcome you and your father to woodside with one of my famous pumpkin-nut breads. Oh, my gosh, that smells incredible! Thank you. Carol. Terry. Why don't you two talk? I just... I-I wanted to, um, thank you for your generous gesture of the Christmas tree. Very, very, very sweet. No, no. That is the least that I can do, believe me. Have you had a chance to decorate it yet? No, I was actually going to donate it to the stage for the Christmas spectacular. You repurposed my Christmas tree? Mm-hmm! The production so needs it. And my son and I really like to get our own Christmas tree each Christmas. You really are all about your traditions, aren't you? Right, I really think it's important for families. I'm beginning to see how you got your nickname. Well, thank you for the pumpkin bread. That's very kind. Thank you for the Christmas tree. Which you gave to the school. A gift that keeps on giving. Apparently. Have a super night. Good night, Christmas Carol. Yeah. Save the library! Thank you! The tree-lighting ceremony, the Christmas spectacular, and now trying to save the old town library. Yeah, you know what? You either need to run for mayor or get a new hobby. Mayor! Oh, come on. An active mind cannot live in an inactive body. More quotes, huh? - Yeah. - How about... all work and no play makes Carol a dull girl? How can I be dull? I sell houses, save libraries, gossip with my friends, thank you. Hey, by the way, I got the 411 on the new guy in town. What? Terry? - Yeah... - oh! Sorry, so you two are already on first-name basis? Oh! So Terry is a widower. Wife passed away two years ago. Works as a construction supervisor for this huge development firm. Travels from town to town, starts a project, finishes, then moves on. Where do you get all your Intel? Town gossip never reveals her sources. Uh-huh. But I am married to the school principal. A-ha! That's got to be a lonely life, don't you think? Being nomadic, traveling around with your daughter? Can't be easy. Well, maybe he's just never met the right person to want to settle down with. Yeah, maybe he hasn't. You know? Oh, shut up. Save the library! Save the library! You're no fun! You know that? We have a bit of a fire we need you to put out, Terry. The preservation society is up in arms over our decimating a hundred-year-old library. A structure that we legally own and have permits to tear down? After the first of the year. But if the preservation society manages to get the courts to hear their plea before then, we are looking at a costly delay in construction. Which is where you come in. The courts can't stop us from building if the structure no longer exists. So we need that library torn down by Christmas. Okay. Um... In order for me to make that happen, I'm gonna have to pull some extra permits, plus, uh, I'm gonna have to find a crew willing to work through the holidays. Then I guess you need to start working your magic. Now. Uh, yeah, I'm gonna start making some calls right now, guys. I'm on it. Okay, first major civil war battle? You guys? Sorry. It's just hard to study when all I can think about is Christmas break. Did I hear "Christmas break"? Can't come soon enough, right, guys? Oh, well, on that note, I bid you all adios. That's French for "goodbye". My mom texted that dinner is ready. One step ahead of you. Oh, I'm afraid my dad's a little slow on the text return. Um, that's okay. She can stay for dinner, right, mom? Oh, we're only having chicken piccata. Considering the fanciest thing at my house comes out of a frozen block, I would love to stay for dinner, Mrs. Montgomery. I might allow it... If you agree to call me Carol. Okay. "Carol." Thank you. Napkins, guys. Where are your manners? Carol, this is delicious. Oh, thank you. Step up from TV dinners, I bet. Yeah, my dad has no problem building a designer kitchen, but his cooking chops pretty much stop there. So, do you get to spend time with your dad over the holidays? Uh, not so much. More in the summer. Well, his dad travels... Internationally. Oh, yeah, I know the drill. My, um... When my mom was alive, my dad would fly home for weekends when he was out on location, at building sites. Must have been hard. Yeah, it was. Um... I can't think of one dance recital, one softball game, one parent-teacher conference that my dad didn't miss because of work. But I know he's trying to make up for it now. That's why he volunteered to help with the spectacular. Of course, he wants to spend time with you. Yeah. Oh, that's probably him now. I'll get it. So, is your mom twisting your arm to be a part of the spectacular? Uh, no, actually, she's twisting both my arms. Wow! Look at this place! I feel like I'm entering Santa's lounge. What, you think it's over-the-top? No! No, it's... It's beautiful. And yet, it feels like something is missing. What? What are you talking about? I don't know... Maybe something about a very special Christmas tree... Oh, a Christmas tree! That you like to pick out. Yeah. My mom's got bigger fish to fry. She's doing the Christmas tree lighting in the town square. You guys should come. Yeah! It only took two years, five bake sales, two rummage sales, and then a couple of car washes to pull it off. It's a shame you haven't learned how to get more involved. And we'll be there. Right, dad? Oh, no. Absolutely! Absolutely, we will. Great. And, by the way, thank you for letting her stay for dinner. I mean, whatever you guys had, it smells incredible. Well, she might've mentioned that you didn't get to cook tonight, so we made you a little take-out. Could you get it, please? Carol, that's very kind of you. You didn't need to do that. I enjoy it. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry also that I'm a little late picking up this one, but, uh, I am being pulled into this quagmire at work. You know the hotel project that I'm supervising at the town square, where the current library resides... That's... that's your project? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, well, it turns out that the preservation society is trying to stand in the way of progress and they've actually... get this. They have filed a petition to prevent us from tearing down that decrepit old building. I mean, some people. They just don't understand what progress is, do they? Right? Dad, I think that Carol may be on the preservation society. Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm actually not on the preservation... Oh, thank goodness. You had me scared for a minute. But I'm just personally, um, responsible for the petition to keep the library. Of course you are. You do know that the library was the first building erected since woodside was founded? - I sure do now. - Yes. Well, bon appetit. Yeah, it's a funny thing. I've suddenly lost my appetite. Yeah. But we've already got approval to start tear-down on the library after the first of January. So what's the holdup? The city commission has returned your request. They require further explanation on your amended date of demolition. Our completion date has been pushed up, so we need to break ground immediately in order to make our deadline. State that here, and I will hand it back to the planning commission. Okay. Any way to put a rush on this? I can't make any promises this time of year, but I'll try my best. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so what is going on with you? Nothing. I'm excited for the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony. Then why does your face look like you just swallowed a Christmas tree? Oh, how was I supposed to know that Terry was responsible for the hotel going up? You couldn't have! Just like he couldn't have known that he was gonna cut you off and send your Christmas tree sailing. You two cannot seem to get out of each other's way. Maybe it's kismet. Maybe it's Karma. So what did I do? I don't know why you're being so hard on yourself about this. I don't know. Maybe I was getting used to being frenemies with him. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Because I actually thought it was a nice gesture on your part to let Terry hold open auditions for the Christmas spectacular without you. Wait, what? What? Open... Auditions? Ohh! Darn it! That's great, guys, thank you. We'll be in touch, all right? Okay! Who's up? Come on in! I'm up. What? You're gonna hold open auditions without even telling me, Terry? Carol, relax, okay? I'm not cutting you out of the process, I'm just getting a leg up. Oh, a leg up, with what, a 10-foot, uh... What is that, anyway? I thought that was a fresher take on the old, traditional Santa. We've seen it a million times. Right? Just something new. I don't understand why you just want to throw away traditions, Terry. What is your objection to anything that's modern and forward-thinking, like... Like the old, forgotten library? It's not forgotten! The old library... The old library has a very dear place in my heart. I don't understand why you want to put a big concrete-like eyesore... Eyesore? No, let me tell you. That is actually a hotel that your town, this town, desperately needs. Well, just because it's new doesn't make it better. And just because it's old doesn't make it right. Are we talking about the Christmas spectacular, or are we talking about your hotel? What is the difference? Guys! See you for a sec in my office? You did this. Look at that. That's not my fault. Go to the principal's office. Really? That's my fault? All right. We can talk about that. - Excuse me, guys. - Let the lady through. Thank you, thank you. You don't like me very much, do you? I don't... I don't know you well enough to like you. What else can I tell you to help push you over the edge? You having fun? You think this is funny? I love Christmas, it's important to me. Trust me, I know, okay? I got the memo, I got the minutes to the PTA meeting, I even got the newsletter. Believe me, I'm up to speed on this. Oh, by the way, I got your empty food containers in the car. So, someone got his appetite back. Well, I had to eat something, didn't I? It was actually really delicious. Of course it was! I know. It was very good. Okay, so which one of you has a difficulty playing well with others? Obviously not me. I'm a walk in the park. Uh, more like a walk off a cliff. Well, if you didn't swoop in like "hurricane Terry". What? Okay, let's not go down this road again. I think the key to making this work with you two kids is compromise. I could not agree more. And I could not agree more-er! See? That's what I'm talking about. It's not a competition. Now, obviously, Carol, you want a more traditional theme and you want to do something a little more modern. "And never the twain shall meet." Hopefully. Hang on! What if you combine the two, hmm? What if you worked on the theme of "Christmas past, present, and future"? I like it. Really? Don't look so surprised! That is literally the first thing we've ever agreed on. What are the odds that's gonna happen again? Probably never. Right. We can always pray for a Christmas miracle! Relax! I didn't embarrass you. I promise. If you just give her a chance, you'll actually see Carol's really nice, once you get to know her. I'm trying, honey. Believe me, I'm trying. You got called into the principal's office? Yeah. What about it? You know, it wouldn't kill you to keep your mind open to new ideas. I'll do it if you do it. You having fun? - Yeah. - Hi! I'm Jill. Carol's best friend. I have heard a lot about you. I am sure you have! I, uh, hope you don't hold it against me. Ha! Yeah, I guess you got a little more than you bargained for when you and your daughter moved to woodside, huh? It would appear so, yeah. But you know what? I really think we're gonna be able iron out our wrinkles, you know? Glad to hear it. Truth is, you're good for our Christmas Carol. And how do you figure that? Ah, you give her a run for her money. I think life's much more interesting when we meet a few challenges. I guess you're right. You know, I've never really though of it that way. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the mayor of woodside. The first official Christmas tree-lighting ceremony began in 1945... To welcome our troops back to their families after the end of world war ii. In the ongoing six decades, it became a city tradition until budget cuts forced its closure. But, luckily for us, one very determined resident made it her mission to bring this time-honored event back to woodside. Ladies and gentlemen, Carol Montgomery! Thank you. You're welcome, miss. We love you, Christmas Carol! And I love you. My friends, my family, our family, our woodside family. I think people make fun of me because I often talk about how much I love tradition, and this ceremony is a part of my affection for this particular holiday, because we get to take a moment, stop, reflect, be with our families, sit by the fire, make cookies, and remember how much we love each other, and how much we care for each other. This tree is for our families and this beautiful community. Merry Christmas, woodside family... For you. All right! Merry Christmas! Okay, uh... Merry Christmas! Okay... Little glitch! Um... A little, um... Okay, why don't we... Bring up my favorite caroler? Where are you? Come on! ♪ o, Christmas tree o, Christmas tree ♪ dad, you need to do something. I'm not so sure, kiddo, I think maybe I should stay out of this one. But you know how to fix it. ♪ Thy leaves are so unchanging ♪ come on! Go! Go. All right. Carol, do you want some help? Do you... Maybe. Isn't this fun? Ah-hah... Yeah, you got a loose wire here. Yeah. I-I-I don't know if this is it. Way to go, dad! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Carol! Hi, Nina. How are you? Um, terrific. How are you? Not too bad. Hey, Terry! Epic save! Bye, Carol. Appreciate it. Well, well, well. Hi, Carol. If it isn't the town hero... Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sure. Why? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm just... I'm just being... I have some silly thoughts in my head. You know that? I love that you came in and just totally saved the day last night, it's fantastic. I'm very appreciative. I worked so hard on that project... And then, with one fell swoop, you just came in and... became the hometown hero. No, no, Carol... Carol, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to steal your thunder. No, no, no. Never mind. You didn't steal my thunder. That's not... Are you sure? I said I was being silly, okay? No, no, no, no. This is not being silly. I mean, quite the contrary, actually. Okay. Listen, Carol. When you're not busy trying to always be perfect, you're actually really endearing, okay? Wow. Is that a compliment? Yes! It's a compliment. Thank you, I think. You think I'm always trying to be perfect, huh? No, no, no, no, no. Not "try". You are. I mean, seriously, Carol, I have no idea how you get half the things done in a day that you do. I mean, you're like some kind of whirling dervish with Christmas ornaments. - Thank you. - Yeah. I think. I have no time-management skills. I'm in awe of you. I mean, I'm always borrowing from Monday what I didn't... Get done on Friday. It's ridiculous. Case in point. This is work. Uh... Carol, I-I am so sorry. I'm gonna have to cut this short. I have to run. Okay. Uh... We didn't really even, you know, talk about the show. No, I know. I know. Hey, hey, here's an idea. Why don't you bring Amelia over to my place after study group, we'll do all of this at my place over dinner. What do you say? Well, it's a date. I mean... A work dinner. Yeah, it's a working dinner date. You'll cook? I'll even cook. Huh. There you go! Uh, I have to go. Okay? I think... This Christmas past, present, and future, it really has potential! Yeah, yeah, I like it. Okay! I'll see you tonight! Okay. It's a date. Dinner. And you put a pan and then you put the oil and then turn up to high, and then you... "Brown meat". Where am I supposed to find brown meat? If you're asking that question, you're already in trouble. Well, I'm kind of a work in progress here, folks. That's a bit of an understatement. And besides making a mess, what are you making? It's kind of a sloppy Joe- meets-beef stroganoff... Thingie. Good combo! Well, I hope they meet quick, because I'm starving. Yeah. I think you might be burning. Oh, shoot! I'm sorry, guys. I am kind of cooking-impaired here, if you haven't noticed. We've noticed. Why do you think Carol's here? Maybe you could teach my dad to cook something, anything? Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. My mom can make a gourmet meal with, like, two ingredients. There you go! That's pushing it. Two? Two? I mean, I can probably even swing three, if we're pushing it. You know, ahem. I don't want to miss out on that "sloppy stroganoff". Actually, you do. You definitely do. This is for you. Oh, Carol, you didn't have to bring dessert. Oh, we didn't, we didn't. Ornaments! We just had a few extra. Thought you might want to get a jumpstart on your empty tree. You really do think of everything, don't you? Duh. Well, I know how to put these to good use. Care to help? Yeah, sure, just work up my appetite. Okay, should we, um, take another look in here? Okay, let's see what we've got. All right. It ain't pretty. Hmm... no, it ain't. No. The key to a good chef is always keeping one key ingredient on-hand that can turn any dish from "yucky" into "yummy." Garlic? Tsk. Looking good here! Carol, this smells so good already. What do you call it? "Cooking." Very funny. All right. I think I've got these all chopped up. What do you want? Nice job. Now, you're gonna bring 'em over here. Gonna gradually add them in with the garlic. Okay, I can do that. Ooh, sizzle. Great. Nicely done. Okay. And, um... A little bit of salt. Salt. A little more? More is better with salt, usually. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Dash of pepper. Say when. When. Okay, now you're going to let it, um... Are you ready for this word? Well, now I'm actually a little scared. - You should be. - What? Simmer. You know, I've actually heard of that word. Yeah, I have. It's a... It's a good word. You know. Simmer. Well, that was quite a turnout today at the auditions. I'm telling you, Carol, if we get all these kids together, and can really nail down that theme we're talking about, "Christmas past, present, and future," I'm telling you, this is gonna be one great show. Oh, because you mean all of the kids that auditioned are going to be in the recital? Well, it's a little thing called "Christmas spirit," Christmas Carol. You know, I think you are a little familiar with that, concept... Okay, okay, okay. This looks so good! Can I try this? You want to? Voila. You have just made your first meal. Mm! That is so good! So what'd I make ya? Escargot. And you said I couldn't cook! What if, for the "present" section, we combine the modern-day take on the dance of the sugarplum fairies with your very beloved Santa on stilts? Okay, now that's just crazy talk. Oh! No, I like it! I think it's entertaining, it's visually surprising, and yet... Very traditional. All right! Right? Okay, you two. You haven't offered anything for the festivities. What are you gonna contribute? Right, I mean, it's very unchristmas of you, I'd say. Yes, it really is. Almost scrooge-like. Mm-hmm. I was thinking about maybe doing a recital of 'twas the night before Christmas? - Oh, that's good. - Oh, I like that. Yeah. - We could put that where... - in the past. Christmas past. I'm in. All right. Great. And what's your hidden talent? My superpower? Well, it's hidden, even to me. He plays a mean saxophone. Get out! Really? That's why I volunteered to help decorate. I like to decorate things, and then just stand as far away as I possibly can. Okay. I see. Tonight was really good, you guys. Yeah, I mean, this was very productive. Well, I think so. And we decorated. We decorated... we have covered a lot of territory here! This was good. Work dinners, they might be a good idea. Kind of a good idea. In fact, I bet we could even do this again... Ooh. If we wanted to do that. Hey, I have an idea. If you two are willing to do a little clean-up, I was gonna invite your mom out for a little Christmas surprise. Sure! - Yeah. We can do that. - Yes. Definitely. Wait. No. I don't know. I'm... what kind of surprise? Well, if I were to tell you... It wouldn't be a surprise! Thank you! Ahem! So, you said that you like fresh, right? Well, you're not gonna get any fresher than these, and, by the way, may I add, these are all blue noble. - You know, I noticed that! - Your favorite. - Did you? - Mm-hmm. So what do you do? You actually take the tree out of the pot, and you plant it in the ground? All right, living trees are an environmentally-friendly alternative to cutting down trees. They're meant to be replanted. And who knows, you might even find a new tradition out of this. Well, let's not push it! Right. Anything here catch your attention? Um... That's a winner. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Let me get you that tree. I need to get you that tree. I don't believe it! What? The Christmas tree isn't decorated. It isn't? Sure you're feeling all right? I just thought you would be surprised if you came downstairs and saw that I didn't decorate the Christmas tree last night. Yeah, well, I am! Seems like you're putting a dial on your Christmas enthusiasm. Never! I just thought we would have a little party, maybe invite a couple of people over, see if they wanted to help us decorate the tree tonight. Yeah, that sounds like a plan. ♪ ...Sing a song for you ♪ a song of Christmas cheer to a neighbor good and true ♪ ♪ love and joy come to you ♪ ♪ and a merry Christmas, too ♪ and god bless you and send you ♪ ♪ a happy new year ♪ and god send you a happy new year ♪ that is so good! Great job. That's great! That's terrific! Go off stage-right, please. And we're gonna have Amelia come on. Amelia! Come on out! Hey, honey. Um... should I start? - Yeah, start, honey. - Yeah, start. Okay. 'Twas the night before Christmas when, all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care... You know what we could do to make this more lively? Hmm? What? If we bring out the characters and have them onstage with her, would that be a good idea? I would love to see Nelson as a mouse. Or maybe we could... What, bad idea? No! No, no. I was just about to say the exact same thing. - Oh, you were not. - No, I was. I promise. - Get out of here. - Mm-hmm. This is getting annoying. - What is? - Agreeing all the time. Oh, the agreeing, yeah. I'm beginning to think that you put something in the pasta primavera last night. - Maybe I did. - What did you do? "Tore open the shutters and three up the sash..." I was kind of hoping that, um, we could return the favor and have you over for dinner, maybe a little tree- trimming party tonight? That would be really nice. Yeah, yeah, that's definitely yes. "dash away, dash away, dash away all!" Uh, Carol, do you mind? No, no, no. Yeah, Penelope, I'm on it as we speak. Yeah, I've got it. "But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight... "'Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.'" that was great. So terrific. You're gonna go off stage-right again... And now... You know what I want to see? I want to see the carolers come out for "hark, the herald angels sing," and let's try it with the unicycling juggler and the hula-hooping elf. Come on, guys, all come out on stage at once. ♪ Hark, the herald... Yeah. The planning commission approved the permits and we can begin demolition immediately. That is Christmas music to my ears. I'm sure the folks over at the preservation society won't be pleased, but that's no longer our problem, thanks to you. Now all you need to do is find a crew to tear down that library by Christmas, before a judge can hear their petition. You can't save what doesn't exist. Terry? Are you still there? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm right here. Good job. Talk to you soon. A living Christmas tree? How very progressive of you. Well, I thought it was time for a change. Well, somebody convinced her to switch from the old tradition of buying a Pre-cut tree from the corner lot. Yeah, somebody. As long as you don't change the recipe for your famous pumpkin bread, I'm thrilled. Never. Never! Boy, you made fast work of this, guys. It looks great! Yeah, well, I guess eight hands are faster than one, huh? Mm-hmm. I bet. This is the last of the decorations. Figured you should do the honors. Okay. What do you think? Here? Here? - Yeah, that looks good. - Great. Looks great, you guys. - Gorgeous tree. - Gorgeous! Good job. Honey. Hey. Your dad's gonna come, okay? He just probably got... Held up at work. I know. Okay, people. I just want to dedicate this little ceremony to everyone who helped make it possible. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! I am so sorry I'm late. Come in. Come in. You're not late. - No? - Well, maybe a little. - A little? - She's on the steps. All right, thank you. Hey. Hey, kiddo. I'm sorry I'm late. That took a lot longer than I expected. And I see you're still mad at me. Yeah. And... By the way, you missed a really fun tree-trimming party. Oh, honey, i... Amelia, I could use some help in the kitchen, if you don't mind, honey? Right there. Oh, hey, guys. It's none of my business, but your dad really is trying. You don't know. He does this all the time. Some parents don't have flexibility when it comes to their work commitments. I understand, but with my dad, this seems to always happen. "Always"? That's a big word. You told me he was volunteering so he could spend more time with you. Yeah, well, now see what he's doing? Well... Don't judge us on a pass-or-fail scale. None of us would leave unscathed. Yeah, present company excluded. Don't Polish my halo. ♪ fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ troll the ancient yuletide Carol ♪ ♪ fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la ♪ that is great, guys. Thank you! Uh, everyone, that's gonna be a wrap for today, okay? Check the website for your schedule tomorrow, and let's do it all again then. All right? Good job, guys. Hey, Terry. Have you seen Carol? Uh, Carol, let's see. She is out shopping for period costumes for our carolers. She really wants them to look very authentic, as you can expect no less from Carol. Uh, true. You know, I don't think that Carol's really the phone-it-in type when it comes to pretty much... Anything. Yeah, yeah. Listen. On that note, tell me. Has Carol always been this gung-ho about the Christmas holiday? She would probably say yes, but the truth is, she's been kind of dialing it up a notch since her husband left. Oh? Four years ago. She didn't see it coming. Broke the news to her right after Halloween. That was the year that she barely got out of bed the whole month of November. Whew. Huh. She was really blindsided, huh? Yeah, pretty much. But Carol's not really the feel-sorry-for-me type, so, she took a month or so to bounce back, right in time for the holidays. Just a month or so? Are you serious? Oh, you don't know our Carol. Well, maybe not totally, but... I mean, I think I'm starting to. Hmm! See you. Hey, you. Hey. What's that smell? It's called "cooking." Look who's turning into a born-again chef. Yeah! Carol has told me all about the magic of the crockpot. You just pour everything in there in the morning, and then, six hours later... Work again? Listen... I know I haven't managed to strike the right balance between work and personal life just yet, but, um... I want you to know I am really trying here, kiddo. I know. I've seen how hard you've been struggling. It's just, um... I don't know. Lately, I always seem to find myself caught just trying to do what I think is right. You know... Maybe instead of trying to do what's right all the time, you should try doing what's best. When'd you get so smart? Hmm? Come here, you. I love you. I love you, too. Hey. Did you call me down here 'cause you're having a crisis of conscience, or do you want a fight? Hmm... well, maybe a little bit of both, after you hear what I have to say. Um... My boss has forced me to find a loophole around the preservation society's petition all together. What, do you want me to tell you something to make you feel better? No, I don't. No. I want you to tell me why saving this old library is so important to you and the society. It's not the building. It's the... It's the past. It's what it represents, it's the history... It's what it means to woodside. It's tradition. It's tradition. What about the future and where we're headed? What about that? Both can exist at the same time, can't they? They're both important, right? I... Uh... it's Amelia, wondering when I'm coming home. How are things going with you two? It's, uh... Actually getting better, thanks to you. No... She just, uh, needed an ear. You've been a good influence, and I'm not just talking about Amelia. You know, when my wife passed, I got into this weird place where I was always just worrying about tomorrow, and, I'm telling you, being around you for the last couple of weeks has... Given me this whole new perspective. How so? Showing me that the little things in life really matter. You know, like cooking dinner for my daughter, for one. I think we're all doing the best we can. Yeah, I think you're right. I think we do. I got so stuck thinking that I didn't need anyone... I started to believe it was true, until you. That sounds like a really lonely existence. It was. Yeah? Can we change it? I don't know. I'm trying to figure that out myself, to tell you the truth. But... I think that, um... sometimes, it just takes a leap of faith. Oh, no, you don't! Okay, okay! You watch... You interrupt a kiss, buddy? I thought I was only dreaming I smelled bacon cooking. Well, since it's midterms day, I figured you could use a good breakfast. Looks like I wasn't the only one pulling an all-nighter. What are you trying to build? Rome, in a day? Something like that. Yeah. The preservation society? I thought they were the enemy? Maybe not. I got to thinking what you said... Maybe I should, um, stop doing what I think is right, and start doing what I think is best. What? Nothing. Dads... They grow up so quickly. We bring to you gifts of frankincense and myrrh. No, but seriously, what is the deal with her? Yeah! You know what? You've been painting the same brick for the last 20 minutes. Have I? Oh, golly. I'm a little distracted, I guess. I saw Terry again last night, guys. Okay, and? We almost kissed. Almost? Oh, yeah. I don't know, I think we're both still a little gun shy, but I can't stop thinking about him. I don't know. Well, it sounds to me like you are falling for him. Right. Look, if you are worried about getting hurt again, I hate to break the news to you, but that's always gonna be a possibility. That was not a part of your first sales pitch, you know. Look, all that stuff, it's just buried in the fine print. All right? No risk comes with no reward. Yeah, Sarah is right. You know what? Stop overthinking your feelings and maybe start learning to trust them instead. Maybe just one kiss. Oh, hallelujah. You have the proper permits, you had a crew willing to work over the holidays, so explain to me exactly why this library is still standing? Because it would've been an underhanded move on our part, that's why. And all it would've done was create ill will and negative press within the community. Maybe, but that wasn't your decision to make. Now we're looking at a costly legal battle. Or not. I actually drew some inspiration from a similar battle that I was having with a mother at my daughter's school, around the theme of this year's "Christmas spectacular." She was a, uh... A hard-core traditionalist and I wanted something more progressive, so what w... Terry. I don't see how any of this... So we came up with a compromise, and it's the same compromise that I proposed to the preservation society. I beg your pardon? Penelope, just do me a favor, okay? And look at the drawings that I've just sent over to you, all right? Now, look. By not demolishing the library, I figured out a way to maintain the building's integrity, by incorporating its main architectural features into a brand-new hotel design that combines elements of the past, present, and future. This new plan will give the city of woodside a true landmark that everybody will be proud of. And they signed off on this? Pending our approval. And the good news is that, by not demolishing the original structure, we'll be able to finish construction two months ahead of schedule. This is a pretty bold move, you know that? You do realize this all could've all exploded in your face? Well... No risk, no gain. Right? So... What do you say? I think I'm suffering from post-midterm test stress disorder. Oh, ho! I have the cure for that! Who doesn't like Christmas cookies? - Oh, yum. - How does the saying go again? Feed a cold, starve a failure? You didn't fail any of your midterms. I know. I just like to set the bar low so I'm never disappointed. I'm just glad they're over. Right? Two weeks to relax. So what are your Christmas plans? Actually, I was hoping that you could take me shopping this weekend to find a Christmas gift for my dad. He's impossible to shop for, though. Well, that's my specialty. Good, because I need all the help I can get. Plus, maybe my dad could take Bryan shopping for you. Deal. Um... Amelia, it's your dad. No, I already texted him that we were here. That's probably for you. Oh. Well, it says here he's celebrating something. What do you think it could be? Well, you'd better go find out. Champagne? Well, this must be very exciting news. Yes, well, that little dilemma at work has been solved, thanks to you. - To me? - Yes. Okay. What did I do? Well, you inspired me to come up with a compromise, so rather than level the library, we are now going to restore the old structure and incorporate it into a major feature of the hotel. You're kidding me? No. Congratulations! Wow! - Yeah! - Thank you! No, thank you. I mean that. Here. Here. Uh, to... Many, many tomorrows. I wouldn't mind a few more todays. I thought about what you said last night... Yeah? I want to take a leap of faith. I really do. But you have to be careful with me, because I'm going into uncharted territory. Yeah. You and me both. We have so much... We have so much to celebrate. Yeah, we do. And the kids. Oh! The kids. And the... and the... The... The spectacular is going so well! - The show, the library. - I know, I know. I've got, officially, a start date in January, which means I can spend so much more time with Amelia over the holidays. Nothing is gonna make her happier, you know that? Yeah. Well, i... I mean, how long is construction? Uh, let's see, well, it's gonna take a little over a year, barring any unexpected surprises. Mm. And then what? Uh, well, that's the thing. I never know what happens after that I'm always on the road. And that's why I've been pushing for this promotion, to move to headquarters, so that Amelia and I can finally put down some roots, but, you know. Wh-where's headquarters? You know what? It so doesn't matter. Because I am far too valuable on the road for the company. They're never gonna give me that promotion. It doesn't really matter. Not the question I asked. San Francisco. Yeah, we both... I guess decided to go to the next step. Uh, yeah! You kissed. I'd say that pretty much qualifies as a big step. Yeah, but it's already gotten complicated. What? He might... He might take this promotion... Promotion. It's all the way in California. - And? - What? Well, you don't know what's gonna happen in the future. I know, but it's looming. I don't like the "looming" things. Honey, will you stop? You just had your first kiss. My god, just relax and enjoy the moment. Enjoy it? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey, just trust this, okay? And just follow that thing that's finally started beating inside your chest. Okay? Mm-hmm. So, we've already ruled out perfume. Yes, she's too particular. Picture frame? Boring. Scarf? Bland. Gift certificate? Nothing more than that says we didn't put enough thought into this. Yeah, I told you this wasn't going to be easy. All right, well, let's just think here a minute. What present from your past made the most impact with your mom? Truthfully, I think I'd have to go back to kindergarten, when Mrs. Lefford, she got us to make these paper-plate snowflakes with spray-painted and glued-on macaroni. Really? That was a big hit with her, huh? Oh, yeah. So, if we're going for that type of reaction, we've got our work cut out for us. I see. Well... In that case... We may be going about this all the wrong way. Oh, careful, I always burn my mouth on this. Yeah, I've got a baby mouth. I need to wait 10 minutes. 10 minutes? Yeah. Ahh, where's the clock? How is it you have a way of making Christmas shopping not only fun, but easy? Oh, honey, it's my dream to be a personal shopper. 'Cause I look into the minds of the people I love to buy gifts for, and I think, "yes! I know what they want." For me, it's usually the other way around. "What do I want?" Really? And you think that's unique? You're a typical teenager. Yeah. In that case, I should probably search for a giant thank-you card to get you for Christmas. For what? Well, for the turnaround with my dad. He seems to finally be getting it. Honey, sometimes, people just need a little nudge in the right direction. I just hope it sticks. I think it will. Don't get me wrong, I believe that old habits die hard sometimes, but I suppose people can change, right? I know they can. At least I believe they can! People can do anything with the proper motivation. Well, in that case, I have a feeling that this is going to be the best Christmas ever. I think you're right. Mm. Too hot! It's hot! Oh, no! That's very good! I'm very rusty! Here. - It looks good! - You got it? Right? You guys excited? Oh! I mean, of course! I'm very excited to see what the both of you are gonna bring for us tonight! There are gonna be a couple of surprises. Yeah, yeah. I'm just kind of happy we pulled it all together in time. We'll see. Principal Higgins, will you please tell your son that he needs to glue the Santa beard on for the show? Well, it itches! Nelson, you got two options, buddy. I can ground you, as your dad, or give you detention, as your principal. Well, isn't that double jeopardy? Okay, fine, I'll put on the beard. Oh! Thank you, god. Uh, I gotta take this call, guys. I'll be right back. - It's you. - It's me? Yes, Penelope? Come here, you. Let me take a look at this. Henry ballista, the head of the board of directors, is making a stop in woodside on his way to New York. Why? What's up? He heard about that magic act you pulled with the hotel project and he wants to meet you. The firm is making an announcement about that executive position you've been gunning for the start of January. January? Well... I mean, that's when we're breaking ground on the hotel. Well, I guess they felt that your talents would be better utilized elsewhere. He's having dinner tonight with the investors at petit menage. He wants you to come. Well, I can't come tonight. I mean, my daughter's Christmas pageant starts in 45 minutes. I can't do that. Just go in, shake hands, and be on your way. Then you and your daughter can spend the rest of your Christmas holiday planning your big move to California come the new year. Penelope, I c... All right. Look. Tell them, uh, I can give them five minutes. - I'm on my way right now. - Good. What are you doing? I, uh... I have to shake hands with my senior boss. - You're going to work? - No, I can do both. Okay? I can be in and out, and I'll be back in time. You're gonna miss Amelia's performance. No, I'm not gonna miss it. I'm gonna make it back in time. - I promise. - She's first on! Carol, I don't have a choice! You always have a choice. - I don't have a choice. - You always have a choice. I have to do this. Are you really going to do this? I will be back. You're going to walk out? I will be back in time. Where's he running off to? Come here. You okay? No. Are you gonna be okay? Is he coming back? I don't know if he's coming back. I hope he gets what he wants. Honey, you can't make that decision for him. He's gotta do what he's gotta do, if it's right for him. You're gonna be okay, either way. You believe that? - Yeah, I do. - You do? And we got a show. We got a show. I love you. Come on. Hi. I'm Terry Evans. I'm here to meet with Henry ballista. You're the first to arrive. Would you like me to seat you? No, no. I'm just gonna wait. Thank you. Nelson, sweetheart, scratching will only make it worse. Plus, you're the first to go on! Santa! I need you onstage! Ho-ho-ho-Kay! Terry's not back yet, hey? I don't think we can wait any longer. Well, you know what they say... The show must go on. Yeah, I guess it must. You guys wait backstage. I'm gonna go video. Of course. We got you covered. Okay. It's not part of the show. Merry Christmas to all the parents here tonight, students, and family. Welcome to this year's Brookswood "Christmas spectacular." Let's hear it! This year's theme is Christmas past, present, and future, so without further ado, on with the show. 'Twas the night before Christmas when, all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there. How was the meeting? I'll tell you later. And mama in her kerchief and I, in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap, when, out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave a luster of midday to objects below... The tiny little driver so lively and quick, I knew, in a moment, it must be Saint Nick. As I pulled in my head and was turning around, down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound. But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! ♪ ...Glory to the newborn king ♪ Oh, you were so amazing, kiddo. I am so proud of you. - Really? - Are you kidding me? Thanks, but I almost thought you weren't going to come. Well, I wasn't sure there myself for a second, but you know what? I decided I'm never going to let that happen again. You know what? Mm? I really believe you. You better. Come here. I love you, kiddo. Go. I'll see you later. Great job, guys, great job. Great job. You saw her. I did. - I'm so glad. - Yes. Now tell me about your meeting. Uh, we'll get to that, all right? You're avoiding me. No, there's something more important first. - Follow me. - Why aren't you telling me? Follow me. I don't want you to miss your Christmas present. Hmm? Hmm? You convinced him to do that? Maybe a little. Time's up. Did you get the promotion? I don't know, I blew it off. Why would you do that? I have been so busy chasing my tomorrows, that I forgot to live for today. I thought this was the permanence you wanted for you and Amelia. I'm hoping we already have it. Does this look good? Yeah, it looks great. Got that plugged in? Oh, there it is. There it is! The missing piece. There we go. What do you think, huh? No, dad! Don't! Oh, my god. You guys!
