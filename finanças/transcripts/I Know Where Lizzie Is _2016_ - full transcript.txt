- Please, please find my baby. - I see diamonds. Blue diamonds. - Oh, that's my Rodrigo. - Great story. So exciting. Psychic and a dog. Pulitzer prize here we come. - Huh, yeah. - I can feel him. He's close by. - Oh, my sweetness. - He's very close. - Showtime, let's go buddy. - Oh, Rodrigo! Oh, you found him. Oh, how can I ever repay you? And that is when local psychic Tracy Spencer found a very scared little Rodriugo, and made Ms. Emerson Scott, the happiest woman in Verno Beach. - Tracy Spencer is amazing. She found my dog, and she truly has a gift. I've got my Rodrigo back. - Where the hell are they? Well, I'm sure this reunion is worth much more than any painting Ms. Emerson Scott has hanging in any museum. A happy ending here on Verno Beach, I'm Gale Chambers reporting live, for Channel Eight news. - Thank you, it was great. Nice to meet you. - It was nice meeting you. Bye, Rebecca. - I'll be just one moment. - We're late. - I know Lizzie, I know. - Dad, "Elizabeth." - Sorry. Elizabeth. - Wait Lizzie, you forgot your phone. - What? - Thank you. - I thought that thing was fused to your hand. - Ha ha, you're hilarious. - Okay, take care. See you next week. - Can't wait. Oh, and thank you for the dress. You've always got my back. - You look beautiful in it. - Uh, Mom texted me again. - Alright, we'll be there in 10. - I'm taking the blame for this one. - I know, I know. We were having such a great time and it doesn't happen very often, I just wanted to make the most of it while it lasted. - You're doing great, Dad. - Okay. - Okay now let's go, before Mom get's even more mad at me. - Mom's not going to be mad at you. - She's always mad at me. - She is always mad at you, that is correct. ♪ gonna have a good time ♪ let's go, let's go ♪ going out tonight, ♪ it's gonna be all night ♪ it's gonna be all right. - Hey, what do you say we hang for a little while longer next weekend? I can come over Friday instead of Saturday. - Yeah, yeah. That sounds great. You're still not going to Shane Benson's party. - What? - There's no way you're going to a senior party. - You're 15. - How did you even? - Mom told me. Yeah, busted. - This is so ridiculous. Now you guys actually talk to each other? - Gee, Lizzie. We both love you, I'm so sorry. That must be so hard on you. - Well it's just that you've been kind of checked out the past couple of years, I was starting to get used to it. - Hey, I'm here now. - Really, Martin? You couldn't answer my texts? - I lost track of time. - I was starting to get worried. - You're right, you're right. I apologize. - She try the party switcheroo on you? - Yes, of course she did. She thought she'd get away with it too. - Yeah, she's been getting pretty good at that. - Will you please stop talking about me like I'm not right in front of you? - I don't know, Judith. Can we stop talking about her like she's not here? - Martin, I think we can try. - Argh, you guys suck. How am I even related to these people? I swear. - You know, she can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but uh, she's doing okay. - Yeah. - You and Rebecca are really helping me out. - Yeah, Rebecca's been great. I know I need to step it up. We both want this to work out as much as you do. When it comes down to it, it's all about Lizzie. - Martin. - Yeah? - Thank you. - For what? - Backing me up. It feels good to be on the same page again. - I'm trying. - Yeah. Try harder. - I know, I know. - Chambers! What the hell are you doing here? - We need to talk. - This is my home, Chambers. This better be important. - Well, I'm sorry Haskell. It is important. - You got five minutes. - Haskell, you're wasting a valuable resource, sending me on these crappy, crappy assignments. When you hired me, you said you saw something in me. The best you've seen in 15 years. - You gotta pay your dues. You need experience. - Yeah, is this me getting experience? The Pasadena Doll Parade? The world's largest peanut butter cup ever? The feral cat infestation? The strip club zoning dispute? - Hey, two other guys begged me to do that strip club story. - Then you should have put them on it. But the winner? Chasing around some psychic, to find some rich ladies dog. - Hey, she found that dog. That's a great story. - That's not the point. - What is the point? - That I want to report real news. Hard news, stuff that matters. Hey, what about the crime beat, huh? Murders make careers. This is Los Angeles, for God's sake. People are getting murdered all the time. I want to be a part of that. - You've gotta remember something, you've only been on this job for a year. Why should I give you crime? - I'm young, hungry, and I'm going places, Haskell. And if you're lucky, someday, you can be the guy that says you discovered me. - Right now I'm just regretting it. - Yeah well, the Chambers train is rolling out of the station, Haskell, and I highly suggest you jump onboard. Before you're left behind. - You're unbelievable. Amusing, but unbelievable. - You still haven't answered my question, Haskell. - Okay. The next crime story is yours. Now get out of here before I change my mind. - You won't be sorry. - Lizzie, dinner will be ready in 10. - Lizzie? - Elizabeth? I want to be called Elizabeth. Lizzie is a baby's name. - Okay, it's going to take some getting used to. - I can't believe you him about the party, it's like you don't even trust me. - Obviously. You tried to put your father against me. - This is so ridiculous. All my friends are going. - Lizzie, come on. Elizabeth, I know what those parties are like. I've been to those parties. You're not going, you're 15. - You have to stop treating me like I'm a little kid. - Well stop acting like one. - Rebecca treats me like an adult. Why can't you be more like her? - Because I'm your mother. - She's so much cooler than you are, I can talk to her about anything. - Alright, that's it. You're not going to the party. And you might as well tell Liam Harrison you're not going. - Liam, how? Did you read my texts? - You gave me no choice, you've been lying to me. - You are the worst. - I'm just worried about you. I found out he's 18 years old. - You can't keep me from growing up. - No, but I can keep you from growing up too fast. - Yeah, well you're a little late on that one. - What? - I've already done stuff. - Are you serious? Get down here right now, I wanna talk to you. - Forget it, I'm calling Dad. He and Rebecca have just as much say as you do. - The decision has been made. You are not going. And you are working on loosing your phone and iPad. - This is ridiculous, you are such a bitch. - What did you say? - You heard me? - Give me your phone, right now. - No. - You're making this worse for yourself. - This is so unfair. - Phone, now! - You can't control me anymore. I'm outta here. - Good. I am so sick of this, get out. - I'm gone. - Good! - Damnit. - Hey. - What happened? - She won't let me go to Shane's party. - I'm going. - You are? - Yeah, according to my parents, I'm allowed to go. What were the words they said again? Oh yeah, "The day hell freezes over." Come on, we can hang out and binge "Grey's." - I told her I was fooling around with Liam. - Which you're not. - I know, I need you. - Listen, I know. Crisis, right? Just, I'm at dinner and I can't get out, but I will call you as soon as I can. - Okay. - Off the ledge, Lizzie. - Got it. - So what time did you realize your daughter was gone? - Um, she left the house at seven. We had a fight, a pretty serious fight. Hey. Hi. - Oh, Judith. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. This is Martin, my husband. My ex-husband, Martin Holden. - This is my wife Rebecca. - Yes, of course, I've see you "Live Now", I've seen you on TV. - Nice to meet you. - Martin, she's never been gone this late. - Honey, we'll find her. - No, no. Something doesn't feel right. - Kay, so you had the fight with your daughter and she stormed out. - Yes, and I told her to get out. - Wait, you told her to get out? - Martin, she kept pushing me and I lost it. I mean, she stormed out and she just left and I told her to get out. - Judith, how could let this happen? - I know I feel horrible. - Damn it, what the hell is wrong with you? - Please don't yell at me. - Let's try to remain calm, okay? Really, pointing fingers will not help us find your daughter. - I'm sorry, I just can't believe she's gone. - Don't blame yourself. This is not your fault, okay? - What can we do? - Well, we normally wouldn't even get involved this quickly. 90 percent of the time, these kids end up at the boyfriend's house or something like that but, well frankly, because of your high profile, Mr. Holden we can't rule out that this is a legitimate abduction. Have you been contacted by anybody? Whether it be a phone call or a ransom note? - No, nothing, no. - No. - Talk to me, Haskell. - Got one for you Chambers, Martin Holden. - Hold up, the guy that invented Live Now? - Big fish. His kid is missing. - Runaway, kidnapping, what? - Don't know yet. 15 years old, and no contact from a kidnapper. Not much to go on, but he's Live Now so it deserves some coverage. Want it? - Do I want it? Hell yes, I want it. Actual, real news? Bring it on. Handsome millionare, teen girl missing. I can sink my teeth into that until they find her. Or a body. Or maybe she's been sold into sex slavery. That would be awesome. - Go for it Chambers. Milk it for all it's worth. - You already know, Haskell. Let's do it. Judith, this is gonna work. - It's been two days. - Mr. Holden, using Live Now to get the word out, I mean, this is incredible. - Yeah, well this press conference is gonna stream live, to YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere. Someone out there must know something, they must have heard something. - Alright, well getting you and Judith in front of the cameras, that is key. Because, well, these kidnappers what you want to do is look at Lizzie as someone's little girl. - Hot shot, right over there. Let's go. - Got it, we know the drill. - Is the angle good? Alright, hey, do we know what's going on? Did they find that kid's body? Live Now is picking this up? Chuck, this is gonna go national. Can you feel the excitement? - Just tell me when to roll. - Down boy, curb your enthusiasm. How do I look, Chuck? - Camera ready, Boss. - You bet your ass. Alright, it looks like they're about to start. You're on in three, two, - This is Gale Chambers for Channel Eight News. The family of missing teen Lizzie Holden is about to make a statement. Lizzie's father is Martin Holden, the genius behind Live Now Media. - Good morning. 15 year old Lizzie Holden has been missing for 36 hours now. The family would like to make a statement. - Our daughter is Lizzie Holden. And she is the sweetest thing. She is kind, and gentle, and we miss her so much. Her smile can light up a room. We need your help. Please, to the person who took her, I know there has to be good inside of you. And I am hoping that you do the right thing and bring Lizzie back to us. Please, I beg you. - Please, we need to have Lizzie home, so if you know anything, or you heard anything, please contact the Verno Beach Police Department. Thank you. And for the kidnappers, here this. Listen to me, we're prepared to pay two million dollars for Lizzie's safe return. No questions asked. Please, we just need to get Lizzie back. - What are you doing? I'm getting my daughter back. - Do you realize that every nut job is going to come out of the woodwork? You have taken resources away from helping your daughter. There seems to be some kind of disturbance at the mic, regarding Holden's statement. We're trying to hear exactly what the detective is saying. Detective Williams, Detective Williams, Gil Chambers, Channel Eight News, is it true that you haven't heard from the kidnappers? No ransom demands? - I'm sorry, I can't answer any questions that might compromise the integrity of the investigation. I'm sorry. I know where your daughter is. Your daughter's alive. I know where Lizzie is. - Who is that? - Okay, officers. - I can help you. Your daughter is alive. Let me help you. Lizzie's alive. - Wait, wait. - Lizzie's alive, she's alive. - Gale Chambers, Channel Eight News. Can we just have one word? - Okay well, this is ridiculous. I'm not getting anything out of her. - Ms. Spencer, you need to tell us something concrete. - The FBI takes these situations very seriously. - I already told you. I'm a psychic. I didn't even know who these visions were about until I saw the news this morning. - Well then we need to move on. - I help people find each other, living or dead. I'm a spiritual facilitator. These visions of Lizzie, they just keep coming, whether I want them to or not. I can't control it. - And you expect us to believe this? - I don't expect anything from you. I'm just telling you what I'm seeing. - Oh, you mean, your "psychic visions?" Okay, go ahead then, tell us. Where is she? - Okay. I see a dark room. I see her hands, tied to a bed. I see she's cold, she's she's so scared. She's really scared. But I can feel her breathing. She's definitely still alive. - Okay, well we are officially wasting our time. - We have real clues to look at, okay? - I'm just trying to help the Holden's get their daughter back. - Then why don't you just come out and tell us where she is. - It doesn't work like that, it's not clear. If I knew where she was, I would tell you. - I know her. - Yeah, she's in the news. She's like a psychic or something. - You must have seen her. I mean, it was a big deal. - Never seen her before in my life. I'm not buying this. - I need to talk to her. Okay, if she knows where Lizzie is, why isn't she taking us to her? - Martin, these things take time. I'm sure they know what they're doing. - I cant wait. - Hey wait, Judith don't. - Ms. Holden, you can't be here. You really need to go. - I'm not leaving. - Ms. Holden, we're trying to find out what this woman knows. You have to let us do our job. - I'm not leaving, you can arrest me if you want. Please, I'm begging you. Do you know where Lizzie is? - It's okay, it's alright. She's alive. - She's alive. - Yes. - Okay, come on, let's go. - No, no, no, wait. One minute please. - I can see her. She's, she's running. She's running fast. She's wearing a denim jacket. She's, she's upset. She's very angry, with you. - Oh my god. - You had a fight. It's why Lizzie's angry. Wait, I'm sorry. It's Elizabeth. She wants to be called Elizabeth. - How could you know that? - Oh, I see. A necklace, a purple crystal pendant, and it's special to her. Does that mean anything to you? - Yes, yes, yes. It's an amethyst. I gave it to her for her last birthday. - I feel her breathing. I feel her heart beating, it's very strong. She, she's scared but she's alive. - Where, where is she? - I don't know yet. - Okay, Ms. Holden. - No, no. - Okay, Ms. Holden, please. You've gotta come with me, okay? - She's alive. - What? - She said, Lizzie's alive. - That's amazing. - She knew things about Lizzie, only things that I could know. She could feel her heart beat. - Judy, can you hear yourself? Judith, this is BS. I don't even know why we're wasting our time with her. - Martin, stop. Judith, what else did she say? - She knew about the necklace. The one that I got her last year. - She's exploiting our daughter's kidnapping, can't you see that? - She knew about our fight. She knew about being called "Elizabeth." Martin, we have to believe her. - We have to believe her, Martin. This is, come here. This is so good. - Excuse us. - What is it? - The kid. The boyfriend, Liam Harrison. He is on a surfing trip with his family, so that's a dead end. - Anything on Ms. Spencer? - Nada, she's clean. There's no arrest, complaints, nothing. The psychic angle checks out. She has done this before. She even has a YouTube channel. - What do you wanna do? - Well, let's cut her loose. See how fast we can get a warrant and search her house. - She's okay. - Okay, Ms. Spencer, that's it. Okay, I'm not going to let you string along this family any longer. - I'm not talking about Lizzie. Janine, she's okay. - What? My wife? - You need to tread lightly, Ms. Spencer. She wants you to know that the pain is gone. And she's grateful for all the sacrifices you made for her. She knows that you never left her side. You're a good man. And she's beautiful again. Just the way you remembered her. Not like in those last few months. - That's enough. - She's showing me a piano. Does that mean anything to you? - Yes. - Sometimes spirits show me something to help you understand that they're coming forward. - She loved that piano. - Well she's glad that you kept it. Even though you can't play. - I'm taking lessons. - She's laughing. Yeah, she says that you're still not very good. But she's excited that you're still tending to her hydrangeas out front. She says they're as beautiful as ever. - Ms. Spencer, you're released. You're free to go. - I'm not going anywhere. - Look, you might have some kind of a gift, but you are giving this family false hope, and dragging them through hell while you do it. - Let's hear her out. These things about Janine, she's really all we have at this point, so there's no harm. - You're in charge, FBI's just here for support. - Can we stop wasting time here and help this family? I just want to help find Lizzie. She was taken right here. Something was slowing her breathing. She was, she was drugged, confused. - This is ridiculous. - Mr. Holden, I've been having these kind of visions since I was seven years old. - Can you tell me why we're supposed to believe any of this stuff? - I don't see the harm in letting her help the investigation. - It looks like she's holding up the investigation. - All you're doing is blocking the energy. - We can't shut anyone out who might have any information. - I agree. - Fine. - Oh, something's wrong. Something's wrong. - What is it? - Her foot, something with her foot. - My God it's Lizzie's shoe. - How the hell did we miss this? Okay, get this to the station. I want it copied and marked. I want the test results ASAP. - Now do you believe her, Martin? - Well, there's nothing here. Thanks for your cooperation. - Yeah, no problem. Now I can really focus my energies on finding Lizzie. - Thanks for the iced tea. - Absolutely, I know how hard you guys work. - Okay, take care. - Be safe. - Hey, Mrs. McMillan. You stay right there. We'll get you fed and up to bed soon. - How is she? - Oh, thank God you're here. Use some back-up. Come on. - No. - There you go. That wasn't so horrible. It's disgusting. - Well that wasn't very nice, was it? - Why should I be nice to you? Why did you kidnap me? - Have another sip of juice at least, alright? You must be thirsty. - Don't think those masks are gonna save you. I can hear your voices. I'm gonna nail you in court with a voice ID. That's a thing. I'm gonna watch you fry, Whitey. - Wow, that's harsh. - Do you even know how powerful my dad is? He's never gonna let you get away with this. Never. Never. - I dosed her juice. - Good. - Baby, everything went perfectly. - Oh yeah? Not up here, she's difficult. - Why's she calling you "Whitey?" - I don't know, the mask, it's white. Hey listen, Tracy, this sucks. - Oh just hang in there, baby. How's it going with the old bat? - Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Still catatonic. I gotta come back at six and feed her, change her, and then put her to bed. - Oh, you're such a good man Henry Spencer. - Oh yeah, well. I can check on Lizzie when I come back then too. But Tracy, seriously, she is a humongous pain in the ass. - Patience, I love patience. - Chuck, I'm gonna need you on this. Talkin' overtime, we're on again at the top of the 11 tonight. - Great. - Gale Chambers. What? No way. ANN? Yeah, of course I can get to the psychic. I just broke Tracy's story last week. No way. My God, the exclusive? Me? Yes, of course, of course. Just call me back. Thank you. Chuckie, you are looking at the next big thing at American News Network. They want me to start reporting on the Holden case ASAP. We're going national pal. Chuck, we're on at the top of the 11 tonight, ANN tomorrow. This kid and that psychic are gonna be my ticket to a brand new desk at ANN, as an anchor. This is my time. I mean "our time." I mean, what the hell would I do without you, Chuck? - So pizza or burgers? - We need to find Tracy Spencer first. - Right. - I stole the show at that press conference, baby. All eyes were on me, it was such a rush. - Yeah, they believed you? That's great. - Yeah, they believed me. When I got that Detective Williams in front of me and I told him his dead wife was looking down on him, he was hooked! All that research and surveillance you did on him really paid off. Oh, that piano story! Oh my God, that was so good. And the sneaker thing, brilliant! You were brilliant, the police, even Williams was like, "How did we miss that?" Oh, the jacket, did you plant the jacket? Cause I'm gonna use that in my reading. - Yeah, yeah it's done. Hey, I can't believe the police searched our house. That's pretty crazy, right? - Yeah, but now we are in the clear in their eyes. Baby, the framework has been laid out. People already recognize me from YouTube and now with the news from that dog case, once again, genius on your part. - Yeah, well, when I saw her at the art show, it was pretty clear that she would do anything for her precious Rodrigo. Listen, Tracy, I'm just... - What, our plan, it's going perfectly. We watched that house for a while, we grabbed Lizzie probably at the perfect time. And her texts, there's so much good stuff for my visions. Oh, the best part, forgot to tell you, you know that reporter Gale Chambers, he came up to me at the press conference. Our big break is so close, I can taste it. - Alright, well a lot can still go wrong before all the fame and fortune kicks in. - Henry, Henry don't be a buzzkill. I see the future, remember? Baby, come on. Don't worry, we're gonna get that girl back to her parents safe and sound. I will be deemed a hero, and then we can ride that wave to me getting my own TV show, like Medium Marge. You know I love that show, I can be just like her. - Yeah, but she's a real medium. And she's fat. - Yeah, well people believe what they want to believe, honey. - Alright, that's all great. I just pray to God you're right about everything, because that girl over at old lady McMillan's house is a pain in the ass. - I know, just give me a few more days. Need to drop a clue here and there, string the police along and make them believe I'm the only one who can solve this case. I'm gonna be a star. And we're gonna get everything we deserve. Oh, Henry look. Look, look, look. - The press conference was turned upside down by a surprise announcement by Martin Holden of a two million dollar ransom, that he himself will put up. - Come on, get to me. - I'm Tracy Spencer and I know where Lizzie is. Your daughter's alive. Let me help you. Lizzie's alive. - I look good. Everything's going so well. We're gonna get everything that we want. - Okay Tracy, I believe you. - Put that down, please. Please, she made that in pre-school. I can't replace it. - Mrs. Holden. I'm sorry, but the faster we rule out you and your ex-husband, the sooner we can focus on the real suspects and find your daughter. - Of course. I know you're just doing your job. - The search team will be out of here soon, and then you can at least have some of your privacy back. - Judith, hey. - Hi. - Hi. - It's so surreal. - I know, they're doing the same thing at our house, I couldn't watch. - Oh my God Judith, how are you holding up? - I'm not. I can't eat, I can't sleep. It's the not knowing that's killing me. - We have to hear something today. After the ransom that Martin offered someone has got to pull forward. - Unless she's gone. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. It's just that you can not say that. You can't say that. She needs to be alive. Okay, and we're gonna get her back. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - You know we really need to pull it together for Lizzie. - She's right. - Volunteers are coming tonight at eight. We have candles, we have printed fliers, so we're ready to go. - Rebecca, you are so amazing for putting this vigil on. - Judith, I know you're her mother but, I love Lizzie too, and I just wanna bring her back. - I know, I know. - Tracy. - Gale Chambers. Hey, I was surprised when you called. - It's good to see you again, Tracy. - Likewise. So, how can I help you? - Well you made quite a splash at that press conference, well played. - I just wanted to help the Holden family. - You know, you coulda just made a phone call. - I think we can help each other. - Really, how's that? Do you want another news story for Channel Eight? - Tracy, I'm covering the story for ANN now. This has gone national. - Congratulations. - No, all thanks to you. - This Holden case is huge and you are smack in the middle of it. I mean, come on. Psychic locates wealthy man's child? This is top of the hour stuff. - Think so? - I know so. - I would be very interested in doing a background piece on you for ANN. I think our viewers would be very interested in hearing your story. - Really, story on me? - Absolutely. The Holdens are very important people. The media's gonna wanna know all the details that go along with a case like this. The investigation, who's helping, who's hindering. All the drama that comes along with these emotionally charged cases. - So you're thinking lots of coverage. - It's guaranteed coverage. Excuse me, I'm sorry this happens all the time. - Hey. - Wow, Tracy Spencer? You're that psychic, I saw you on the news. - Yeah, yes I am. - Do you know where that girl is? - Uh no, not yet. But I'm keeping myself open for messages. - Well, I think what you're doing is amazing. - you're a hero. - Thank you. - Of course. - Bye. - Yeah, I think you may be right. This could be very helpful in finding Lizzie. You know, fantastic for the investigation. - Of course, it's great for the investigation. It's even better for us. Listen Tracy, I like you. So let me be blunt, this is turning out to be a big, fat juicy story. The kind that can catapult a career. Let me put a camera crew on you. I guarantee you will get national coverage on this thing until it runs dry. You'll be a household name. You are the media darling in this scenario. - I mean, I just wanna help the Holden family. You know, use my gift for good. - Yes, exactly. I mean, have you seen all those reality shows with the psychics and the mediums? - Yeah, of course I have. - Like that one psychic on Medium Marge. - Yes, I love her. I could do that, except I'm better. - Of course you're better. You're younger, you're hotter, you're more, oh my God. You can do anything you want, Tracy Spencer. Okay, let's just see what we can do about this. - Okay. - Tracy Spencer. Psychic Savior. Psychic Savior, how does that sound? - Psychic Savior. I think I love it. - Yeah? - I mean, it's exactly who I am. And what do you get out of it? - Just give me the exclusive. I get the head's up next time you have one of your visions, before you go to the police. And once you locate Lizzie, you're going to do a live broadcast on ANN, leading police to her, and reuniting her with her family. It'll be a ratings tsunami. - You've got a deal. - Alright, Ms. Spencer. Now one more thing, I'm going to need you to wear this, whenever you're around the Holdens. If I'm in range, I'll pick up the conversation. So tell me, Ms. Spencer. - Uh, call me Tracy. - Tracy, have you ever worked with the police before? - No, I never have, but I've always wanted to use my psychic gift for good. You know, to help people. Ever since I was a young child, I I had lots of visions, but I never understood what they meant. Mrs. Holden, hey. Did something happen? Are you okay? - No developments, I just I found your website and I had your address and I need to talk to you. - Absolutely, yeah. - I just feel like this is all my fault and Can we go inside? I need to sit down. Yeah, sure. Can you just give me a second? My husband's at home sick and I just gotta get him off the couch. Henry? Judith Holden is here. - What? Why? - She wants to come in and talk. - This is insane, tell her no. It's too close. - I can't do that, just go next door and keep her quiet. - We're gonna get caught. Oh my God. - Will you just get a grip, please? I will figure it out, just go next door. I'll handle it, I'll text you as soon as she's gone. You let yourself in. Sorry about that, come in, please have a seat. I'm sorry that the house is a mess. My husband's been sick. - Oh Tracy, it's fine. I'm just here because I am so lost. It has been over 24 hours since the press conference. Have you felt anything from Lizzie? - No, nothing yet, I'm sorry. - Please, I need to know that my baby is alive. Please. Tracy? Tracy? - Listen you just need to be still for a few more minutes and then I can take the tape off. Be quiet. - I'm not in control of these things. - I'm sorry. I'm just desperate. Here, this. This is Lizzie's, here. I heard that if you have a personal item, it gives you a better connection. - You need to stop pushing me. - It smells like her, please. Please take it. - Listen, all this does, is just block the energy. I can't be forced into anything. I have to be free, and I have to feel open. - I need to know that my daughter is alright. - You have to understand that these visions, they take an enormous toll on me. - I, I am sorry, I didn't - I know, I know, I know you didn't mean it. It's okay. It's okay, we're gonna find her. I promise. You just have to trust me. - I do, I do. - You scared me, Whitey. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Please don't cry. - Are you gonna kill me, Whitey? - No, no, I swear. You'll be home in a couple days. - Doubt there'll be a welcome home banner. - Why would you say that? Your parents must love you. - My mom's pissed at me. We got in this huge fight before, you know, you took me. She practically threw me out of the house. - I'm sorry, it's just, with you, I can kind of see that happening. - She doesn't trust me at all. She wouldn't even let me go to this party all my friends are going to. I looked like such an idiot. - Fifteen sucks. Believe me, I remember. - Doesn't matter now. I missed the party anyways. - Oh, sorry. - What's goin' on Haskell? - You tell me. - What? - I just got off the phone with the lawyers from ANN. When the hell were you planning on telling me that you made a deal to run the Holden story with them? - Ah, I left a message with the overnight producers. I figured I'd touch base with you after. - Come on, I had no idea what they were talking about. I looked like an idiot. - It's a huge story, it's a slam dunk for the both of us. - Sure, you get on national television. I lose my best reporter, not exactly a win-win. - ANN hasn't hired me yet. - You must feel pretty good about your chances. Otherwise you wouldn't be screwing me. - Well I wouldn't call it, exactly screwing you. - What would you call it? - I'd call it me hustling to get a story done. - Well I'm glad I can fund your audition for ANN. - I told you I'm going places. When I become anchor at ANN, I'll be sure to put in a good word for you. You never know. Maybe they're looking for a good producer. - I told you you had big balls Chambers. You got an even bigger head. - Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's better to be number one in the nation, than last in Los Angeles. - You know what? Why don't I just yank your story away from you? That way, I've ruined your chances to do either. - See that's your problem, Haskell. You don't see the big picture. - You mean your big picture. - You wanna yank me off the story, Haskell? Go ahead. Alright? Go ahead. I have the relationship to Tracy Spencer. The psychic, I found her. And I am damn sure ANN will give me all the man power, and all the equipment I need to get the story done anyway. And then what happens? Donovan Haskell is out of the biggest story to come out of Verno Beach. - Alright, we'll do it your way. But you better hope that job at ANN comes through because when this story's over, I'm gonna take great pleasure in firing you. - No you won't. Cause I'm the best you got. - Try me. - That guy's wound way too tight. ANN breaking news on the kidnapping of Lizzie Holden. - And for the kidnappers, hear this. Listen to me, we are prepared to pay two million dollars for Lizzie's safe return. No questions asked. Please, we just need to get Lizzie back. A shocking new development from psychic savior Tracy Spencer. Your daughter's alive. Let me help you, Lizzie's alive. We go now to Gale Chambers with an ANN exclusive. As we await word on ransom or whereabouts of missing teen, Lizzie Holden. In my exclusive interview with psychic savior Tracy Spencer, she shares her revelations about - She certainly is getting some coverage for herself. Kay, looks like the guys are finishing up with the sound check for the recording devices. They hook directly into your phone, Mr. Holden. And uh, we're ready. - Uh, now what? - We wait. - Why don't they call? Why is it taking so long? Is that normal? - There's no normal in child abduction cases. They'll call us when they're ready. If this is a kidnapping. - If this is a kidnapping? What else could it be? - Realistically, we could be dealing with a predator. Some type of sex trafficking. - Agent Portman, please. - I cannot even deal with that. - Well given your husband's, sorry, ex-husband's profile, most likely it's kidnapping. - Does anybody want anything? If we're going to be here a while, I'll make us something to eat. Judith, you want to give me a hand? - Yeah, sure. I can use a break from here. - Oh my God, Henry. Did you see that on ANN? You won't believe what Gale Chambers called me. He said I am the psychic savior. That's right, I'm the psychic savior. Isn't that great? - Tracy, we need to give her back. - I know, and we will. We will, but everything is just so perfect right now. - No Tracy, it's not perfect. This all needs to stop. - What are you talking about? We're so close. - No, I can't do this to her, alright? She wants to go home and her parents are freaking out. - Don't wimp out on me, Henry. We've come too far now to let it go. Come on, baby. Just think, they're gonna be so happy when we reunite them. Just a few more days. - I can't, alright? It's too dangerous. Her life is in our hands. It's in my hands and I can't do it. - Baby, listen to me we can handle this. - No, you listen to me, alright? This was supposed to be two days, 48 hours. Can't believe we thought this was a good idea. This whole thing is crazy. Judith Holden was just in our living room. And she didn't suspect anything. - Tracy, if one detail goes wrong, then we go to jail. Or worse, Lizzie could get hurt. And I can't live with that. She didn't do anything to deserve this. - Henry, sit down. We need to talk about this. - No, I can't sit. I can't do this anymore. How the hell did I even let you talk me into this? I gotta get the hell outta here. - Martin, you ready? - Yeah. - Stay calm and try to keep him on the line as long as possible. - Okay. Hello, this is Martin Holden. I know where Lizzie is. - You have my daughter, is she okay? She's alive, for now. - Where is she? Where is she? I want my little girl back. You'll get her. As long as you do what you're told. - Okay, that's fine. That's fine, just name it, anything, anything. Just please, don't hurt Lizzie. Two million dollars. Put them in two canvas duffle bags and bring them to the Shore Cliffs mall. Leave them under the edge of the fountain. Then go to the pavilion and wait. Once I have the money secured, Lizzie will find you there. Six P.M., that's three hours from now. - Okay, okay, okay fine. But how will I know? - Oh no. - Did we get it? - What? - He used a disposable cell phone. - We've got the location but it's moving. Pinning him down's gonna be tricky. - No, no, no, no, no. You do what you have to do. We have to comply to his demands. I'm not messing around with my daughter's life. - Judith, hey. - Tracy, can you come over right away? The kidnapper called. - Yeah, of course. I'll be there as soon as I can. Henry, I swear to God. If you screw this up, I'm gonna kill you. - What are you doing? Where's Whitey? - Whitey's gone. You answer to me now. - Ow, that hurts. - You think this hurts, you little bitch? If you don't behave, it's gonna hurt a lot worse. - Tracy, can we speak with you? Did you find out about the kidnappings? - We're on, Chuck. - Hey, what's happening? - The kidnapper called. - Alright, Martin's got the money and we're gonna get Lizzie back in less than two hours. - The kidnapper called? - Yes, we got his voice. - I want you to listen and see if you can get a read, okay? - Okay, yeah, sure. - Okay. Now you're wired. We've got 20 men that are watching your every move so just take it, drop it, and walk away. - What if I can get to Lizzie? - Don't be a hero Mr. Holden. Let us take care of getting Lizzie back safely and apprehending the suspect. - Are you getting anything? - This doesn't feel right. This isn't him, this isn't the kidnapper. I don't sense Lizzie's presence. - Really? Oh, it's got to be. - What do you think? - I've never believed in any of this stuff. But some of the things she says, they're dead on. - Portman. What? Gotta be kidding me. Alright, um, take him down to the station. Find out what he knows. - What just happened? Caller was a hoax. Just somebody looking for a cash grab. We've got him in custody. We're gonna find out what he knows, if he knows anything. - Oh thank God. - Sorry, Whitey. - Excuse me lady, can you please help me? - Judith, oh wow. I'm getting something, I'm seeing something. Alright, I see her. I can see her. I can feel her, she's cold. - Okay. - She's cold and she doesn't have her jacket. She's missing her jacket, her denim jacket. - You can see her, where is she? - I don't know, but I can feel her. I can feel her, she's weak. She's really weak, but I can feel her breathing. Yeah, she's definitely still alive. - Will you just tell us where our daughter is, Godamnit! - I wish it worked that way. I don't have control of these things. I want to find her as much as you do. - We know you do. - Chinese, Chinese. Her jacket, her jacket, it's Oh wow, her jacket's there. Her jacket's at a Chinese restaurant, a Chinese restaurant on Broadway. What's it called? Wong Palace? Her jacket's somewhere there. - Is Lizzie there? - I don't know, I don't know. But I can feel her. Somebody needs to get there now. Get there now. - Tate, get a team over to Wong Palace on Broadway, now. - Chuck! Change of plans, my man. Wong's Palace on Broadway, let's ride. - I could do Chinese. - I don't believe it. I don't believe it. - What, what? - They found the jacket. - Did they find Lizzie? - No they didn't, but she's close by. I can feel it. - Have them bring the jacket to the Holden residence. - I really needed this. Thanks for joining me. - Yeah, of course. I just had to get out of that house. - Yeah, I can understand that. - You ever think of having kids? - Yeah, sure. I don't know, I guess it's never seemed like the right time. - You should do it. - The way you care about Lizzie, I can tell, you'd make a great mom. - You think so? - Yeah, I do. And it is like, it's like nothing else. That bond. You would do anything to protect them. - Hey. - Oh Emily. - I thought I'd come early to help out. - Thank you. I just want everything to be perfect for Lizzie. - I know, I really miss her. - I've just been keeping up this strong appearance for Judith and Martin but I am hurting really bad. - I'm losing Lizzie, too. - Losing? We're gonna find her. - I know, it's just been so hard. - I think this will help. - Anything to bring Lizzie home. - You scared me, Whitey. - Are you gonna kill me, Whitey? - No, no, no, I swear. You're gonna be home in a couple of days. - Ugh, what a long day. Hey. - Hey. - How's Lizzie? - Well, she dislocated her thumb and got out of her straps. - What? - Yeah, then she escaped. Hit me in the back of the head with a tray. - What does that mean? Is she gone? Henry! - Tracy, God no. Relax, I got her back. - Jesus. - She's over at the house right now and she's scared to death. I had to sedate her again, Tracy. - I'm sorry. - Yeah well, you should be. It was you Tracy, you scared the hell out of her. - How's your head? Come on baby, don't be like that. Oh, that feels bad. Do you think you should ice it? - No, it's okay. - Okay, well let me help you feel better. - Why is it so important for you to be famous? - Because, it's always been my dream to help people. - Oh Jesus Tracy, would you stop? There's no cameras around right now. - I don't know, Henry. I guess I've just always known that I'm destined for more than this. I deserve more. And this is my time, but - But what? - I was with Judith tonight and seeing how much pain she's in, it's just kind of got to me. - Yeah well, it's not a great feeling. - I know. - God, I could have really hurt Lizzie tonight. - Okay, listen Henry. This will all be over tomorrow, I promise. - Yeah, but what about. - I don't care, it doesn't matter. We're gonna get Lizzie back tomorrow and then we can have our life back. We'll be back to normal. - I'm not so sure. - Yes, I'm sure, I promise. It will be you and me. The way we were. Come on. You trust me, right? - I'm trying. - Well you love me, don't you? - Yes, of course. - Well then you have to trust me. - I will. But after the way tonight went, this has got to stop tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay. - I agree with you. Come here. - No, stop. Not tonight. ANN breaking news. The kidnapping of Lizzie Holden. We now go live to Gale Chambers, with an exclusive interview with the Holden family, and psychic savior Tracy Spencer. Only on ANN. - Good morning, Gale Chambers for ANN. Thank you for joining us. We're here today, with the Holden family. Who desperately await news on the whereabouts of their missing daughter, Lizzie. Now Mr. Holden, who do you think would be able to do something like this? What kind of heartless monster would steal your beautiful little girl? - I don't know Gale. I think we're all just hoping it's about money. - So you think it's greed? Not anything more heinous in nature? Nearly 20 percent of teen abductions are likely sex trafficking victims. - We can't think of anybody harming our little girl. It's, She must be so scared. - You okay? It stings. - I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. - You did. - Yeah well, that tray left a mark. - Guess I'm sorry, too. - We're even. - You think it's broken? - Yeah, maybe. This should help set it, help stop the pain. - Whitey, you really scared me. - I know. - I just want to go home. - I know, soon. Hey, what do you say I go fix a good breakfast? - But thank God for the FBI working in tandem with our psychic savior, Tracy Spencer, who has shed so much light on this case, and is indeed a guardian angel for this entire family. - Oh, I'm no angel. I'm just trying to do the best I can for the Holdens. And for Lizzie. - Tracy, tell us about your psychic abilities. How it makes you feel to channel these visions. - Well, frankly the weight of the visions is exhausting. It's a lot of responsibility. - Yes, yes, absolutely. But with the dedicated diligence of the FBI and your exceptional powers, we are going to find Lizzie Holden, and give these heartless perpetrators the justice they deserve. I just want to thank the Holden family, not only for their courage, but for inviting us into their home. And Tracy Spencer, for her gift and her insight. We'll have more on the story this evening, live at 8 P.M. I'm Gale Chambers, ANN. Wow, that felt great, really great. Alright, Chuck. What do you think? Oh, Tracy, are you alright? You were a little "deer-in-the-headlights." - Yeah, I just think the pressure's starting to get to me a little bit. - Okay, well, you better get over that, if we're gonna get you that own show of yours. Psychic savior. - Yeah, right. - Hi. - Jesus. - How you doing, Tracy? Just checking on you, you seem a little skittish. - Yeah well, I guess it's stage fright. - Ugh, get over it. Come on, it's been pretty smooth so far. Foolproof. You as the, what is it? Psychic savior? Or savior psychic? And me as the doting, loving step-mother. Oh God. I have been way too nice for way too long. I deserve a vacation. Listen Rebecca, I can keep this going for another 24 hours, but you've gotta demand that ransom money. That way we can Lizzie home to her Mom, you can get your money, and I'll have my new career. That was the plan. - Change of plans. - What are you talking about? - Well actually, it's not really a change. It's been my plan the whole time. You have to get rid of her. - What do you mean, "get rid of her?" - Lizzie has to die. - No, you said you wanted ransom money. - Oh wake up, Tracy. Lizzie's not going home. She's not going anywhere, ever. - There's no way, I can't do that. - For a psychic, I'm surprised you didn't see this one coming. You know, when I found you on YouTube, you seemed so much smarter. - Look, I know I've done some bad things in my life, but murder will not be one of them. - Yes it will. - Besides, you have no choice. If Lizzie lives, they'll catch you. She'll ruin your life, and you'll go to jail. And I'm pretty certain they don't give TV shows to inmates. Listen to me, I have been good to that little brat for four years, and that measly little two million dollar ransom isn't nearly enough for all my hard work. Do you have any idea how much my husband is even worth? And that will gives it all to his precious little bitch. Lizzie is the only thing standing between me and Martin's many, many millions. - So you want me to kill her? I knew you'd see it my way. Now let's get this done. Tonight. - How did we get here? - How did this get so out of control? - We got greedy. Stopped being who we really are, and we got greedy. - I mean, we were supposed to just babysit Lizzie for a few days and Rebecca would get her husband's money, I would get some notoriety, and that's all that was supposed to happen. No one was supposed to get hurt, remember? - Someone always gets hurt. - We can't do what Rebecca says. - We're not murderers, Tracy. - We're not, right? - Jesus. We're gonna get caught. - No, Henry. I can't go to prison. I mean we can't, we worked way too hard for this. This is not how it ends, no way. You know what, baby? We don't have a choice. We have to do what Rebecca says. - What? Tracy, no. I'm not a killer. - I know that. But we don't have a choice here. You do it. She likes you, she trusts you. I don't know, just make her go to sleep. She won't suffer. It'll be over, but you have to do it. - Please Tracy, no. - And then, I'll tell you where to leave the body. - Oh my God. - And I'll just, I'll tell the police where she is and it'll be all over, I promise. - They're still gonna look for the kidnappers, the murderers. - Let me handle that. I'll handle it. - Hey. - Hey. - How you holdin' up? - Just trying to be strong. - You know you don't have to shoulder this alone. I'm here for you. - I know. You have been. You've been great. - We made a great team once. - We did. - Remind me again why we broke up. - I threw you out. You slept with your assistant. - Yeah. You ready to do the Live at Eight exclusive? - I have to be. We have to do this, Martin. Detective Williams says the more we talk about her on TV, the more the kidnapper views her as a real person. The better the chances are we have to get her home safely. I'm so scared of screwing it up. - You're not screwing it up, you're not. Come here. We're gonna do this together, Bug. - You haven't called me that in ages. - It's kinda nice. - Okay, alright. Let's do this, let's do this. Come on, come on. Damnit. It's time. - It's time? - Yeah. - I can't believe it. Thank you, Whitey. What are you, what are you doing? Whitey, no, no, no, please don't. Please - Excuse me. Tracy? Get me something good. - I know where Lizzie is. I'm at the police station, I'm gonna take them to her. - Okay, the police station? Give me five minutes, I'm sending a van to you right now. We find Lizzie live, on the broadcast, primetime. Tracy Spencer this is going to be... - Okay, we are on in five. - Where's Judith? - She went to talk to you. - Where the hell is Judith? - Hey, you ready? - Uh, just give me a minute. - Hey, Chuck. I've gotta get Detective Williams but is your camera ready? - Yeah. - Cause I'm gonna lead you and the police to Lizzie. - Alright. - Judith. - I'm going with you. - How did you know I was here? - I heard you on the phone with Gale. Why didn't you tell me? - I'm sorry, he forced me to do this live. - Tracy, I don't care. Just take me to Lizzie. - No, this could be really dangerous, no. - It's not up for discussion. I am going with you. Now. - Okay, fine. - When Lizzie was born, it was I can't even begin to explain how profound that day was. It changed me. Lizzie's sassy and stubborn and brilliant and funny. That kid is my hero and her not being here has broken me. - And Rebecca, Stepmom. What is Lizzie to you? - You know, I never thought I'd be a mom. And I can never be her mom. But Lizzie is a gift in my life. We've just become such good friends. More like sisters. - Excuse me Mrs. Holden. I'm just getting this in now. Our psychic savior, Tracy Spencer is at this very moment, leading police to your daughter, Lizzie Holden. Folks, this is incredible stuff. - Where are they? Where is she? - Is she dead? - We don't have those details yet, but we are going to join Tracy, as she leads police to your daughter at this very moment. Okay, I have Tracy on right now. Tracy, can you hear me? - Yes, Gale. - Great, can you give us your location? - We're on Shore Cliffs Drive and I'm just focusing my energy on finding Lizzie. - Okay, and Tracy are you alone? Are you by yourself, who are you with? - I'm here with Judith Holden, and I'm taking her to Lizzie. - You're here with Judith Holden. - Judith? - We're getting close, I can feel it. - We're close, you can feel her? - Yes, we are. - What is going on? Tell me what's going on, tell me what's going on. - Just a moment, please Mr. Holden. - I can feel her breathing. - Oh, she's alive, she's breathing. - I can feel her breathing, yes, getting stronger. I feel her heart. Is it okay, is she okay? What? Tracy? - Mommy. - Oh my God. - Mommy, I can't breathe. - No, no, no, no, no. - What's going on. - Okay, Tracy just stay with me. Can you just tell me, whereabouts are you exactly? - Oh my God, somebody do something. Oh my God, we've gotta get there. Tracy! Is she alive, is she alive? - I think I know where she is but we've gotta go. - Please tell me what's going on. What is going on? - What happened? - Make a left on Ocean View. - Ocean View Drive? - Ocean View Drive, that's where we live. - Yeah, I know. What the hell is going on. - Uh, 1222 Ocean View Drive. - 1222 Ocean View Drive? - Tracy are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - That's our house, that's where we live. Why are they going to our house? - What the hell is going on? - In the trunk, check it. - Oh my God. - Check the trunk. - Okay Tracy, to clarify, you believe that Lizzie is in the back of a brown Infinity. - A brown Infinity, but that's your car. - Yeah I know, but that's impossible. - Rebecca Holden is that your car? - Open it, somebody open it. Detective Williams, we need help. Somebody we need help, open it. Mommy's here, mommy's here. Okay, open it. - Oh my God. - Oh God, no, no, no, no, no. - Oh my God, she's dead. - Lizzie, it's Mommy, it's Mommy. Please baby, please Lizzie baby. - Oh God, she's alive. - What? - I think she's alive. - She's breathing. - She's alive. - Oh God. Tracy. - Oh, oh wow. At this very moment Lizzie's being pulled from the trunk of your car. - How is that even possible? I don't understand. - Did you have anything to do with the kidnapping of Lizzie Holden? - No. - Did you have anything to do with the kidnapping of Lizzie Holden? Mrs. Holden? Do you have any answers? - You know what? I don't have to answer any of your questions without a lawyer present. - Folks, this has been a shocking turn of events. - Our psychic savior has found Lizzie Holden, alive. And now stepmother, Rebecca Holden, may have something to do with the kidnapping. Let's go to the emotional family reunion. And Gale, you're out. - Booyah! Goodnight. Chambers out. - Jerry, listen to me. I need to be gone tonight. How much can I take with me? No, I mean, how much can I cash out? - Tracy. - Jesus, Henry. What did you do? - The right thing. - Lizzie, Lizzie! I thought I was never going to see you again. - No, you ruined our lives, our only hope is that little bitch not being able to identify us. - I'm not a murderer, Tracy. I couldn't kill her. - You think Rebecca's not gonna point her finger at us? - She's not gonna stop, Tracy. - If Rebecca didn't get rid of Lizzie now, she'd find another way, alright? I had to expose her. - You exposed us. - Excuse me, I am sorry about this. Tracy, I just have to tell you, the gift you have been given is incredible. Williams, Rebecca Holden is deceased. She just got tagged by a squad car. - You gotta be kidding me. - Go for Williams, I need detail. I'm sorry, I have to take this. Oh my God. Jesus, Henry, do you know what this means? We got away with it. - Tracy. - No seriously, baby. We can have everything we want, we can have our dreams, I can have my TV show. - Tracy, stop. We will never be free. This will never be clean. - Henry, listen to me. I'm gonna take care of it. I'm gonna handle it, I promise you. Whitey. Whitey? Whitey, it's you, Whitey. Whitey. Whitey. Now on ANN, this is The Whole Truth with Gale Chambers. Tonight, the Holden kidnapping, the exclusive update. We now go live to Gale Chambers, reporting from Verno Beach, California. - Good evening, I'm Gale Chambers, with The Whole Truth. - I'm standing in front of the Verno Beach Police Department and I cannot believe it has been six months since the Holden kidnapping. Our main perpetrator of the case, Rebecca Holden, died the night Lizzie was found alive. Rebecca's motive for the actual kidnapping, greed. Plain and simple. A woman that would stop at nothing, including kidnapping and murder, to get what she wanted. The puzzle pieces of this case were assembled with the help of Henry Spencer. Henry, known as Whitey, to Lizzie is serving a reduced sentence, thanks to Lizzie's impassioned testimony and his cooperation with the police to ensure a safe return of the teen. Henry's wife, our psychic savior, Tracy Spencer has not been so lucky. I'm sure she never predicted a future of a life behind bars. All for fame. But she did not remember, fame is a vapor. Popularity, and accident, and riches take wings. Only one thing truly endures, and that is character. I'm Gale Chambers, and that is the whole truth. - What an ass. - You ready? - Are you kidding me? One Direction? Of course I'm ready. - You guys have fun, see you later. - Hey, Judith. Do you wanna come? - Yeah, come on Mom. - I don't have a ticket. - We're sponsoring the concert, I think you'll be okay. - Yes, I'd love to come. - Mom, I'm so excited.
