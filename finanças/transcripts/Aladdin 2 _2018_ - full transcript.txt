One night where Baghdad, the city of a thousand dangers, was lit by a beautiful moon, a mysterious Baghdadi was entering the palace. Intriguing music. OK, the code. It was something in "am". Uh... Oh yes! I know. Instag ram, open up! Princess Tamtam, open up! Jean-Claude Van Damme, open yourself! Come on, Jean-Claude! Get Low (Dillon Francis and DJ Snake) Patrols 5, 7, 13 on the hunt. Separate yourself! Fallen between the hands palace guards, the thief was going to be presented to Princess Shallia, that the legend wanted sensible, elegant and refined. Are you stupid or what? Let me explain to you. What? This is the treasure of? From Baghdad. And you will be the prince of? (Baghdad.) Sorry? From Baghdad. It's just... - I came out... - Ah! - It's okay... - No, it's not ok! Why do you see us like a vulgar... Robber? Yes, here I am, a thief. Everyone thinks so. Tired of going out with a kid. Me, a kid? After all the efforts what have I done for us? I even accepted the couple therapy. Let's use therapy called "puppetry". The goal is to express yourself through your puppet. Go ahead, hold on. Say what you have on your heart. It's very playful. It's not very similar. Are you ready? You are immature... You make fun of and... Impossible to have a serious conversation. You are immature, you turn all mockery. Impossible to have a serious conversation. Very adult as behavior. Very adult as behavior. It's always that. It's always that! - Stopped. - Stopped. - Stopped. - Stopped. - But stop! - But stop! Oh oh! It's not me, it's the sock. She is only at her head. You do whatever. Do you balance me? Do you want to be confused? Who wears the underpants? It's okay, it was just for fun. With you, everything is for fun. Nothing is taken seriously. And now, are you starting to rob us? I do not steal. I'm bored seriously in the palace. I was going to give everything back. Render what, exactly? Open Sesame. Exact. Sesame. Of course. That's all? Yes, finances are bad. We are on the brink of bankruptcy. - Why did not you tell me? - I tried. But you never listen to me. Aladdin, I know that the problems of the palace are of little concern to you. But we have homework. The people are counting on us. At his death, I swore to take good care of the kingdom. - Who is it? - Ben it's my father! - I painted it. - Oh yeah anyway. Intriguing music. Despite the humiliation suffered the day before, Aladin had decided to start this day with dignity. It's true. I stole our treasure. I know it. I still disappoint you. You do not trust me anymore. For you, I'm still in childhood. It's true, love hurts. Like in a song of Tel I'll do everything. To be. I'll do everything. To be. A good prince. The princess asks you. How long have you been here? It's not my business. Exactly, there is no business. - Why... - No, I do not judge. There is nothing to judge. I will not talk about it. You can talk about it. Me, I fully assume. No, do not talk about it. It never happened to you to want to express yourself in a musical way? The First Lady. Good... What is urgency? We have a visit. Bugles. Shah Zaman, the beautiful and graceful prince of the province of Zoulaoui, the one whose presence intoxicates the crowds, the one whose reputation shakes the world, who always has the last word, the inventor of "He who said it is there,". General of the Air Forces, of land, sea and father. Shah Zaman! Warrior Music. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Welcome, dear... How should I call you exactly? Quite simply... Shah Zaman, the magnificent. And glorious prince from the province of Zoulaoui. The one who intoxicates by his presence. Because it's true, I'm drunk, huh? YES, IT'S TRUE! Some call me leap. Others the versatile, because I versatile. Others call me jovial, others the modest... I am also the inventor of "Whoever says who is there". We're going on Shah Zaman? It's the most user-friendly. So, dear Shah Zaman, I wish you welcome in my humble country. Now that we are done the presentations, tell us the purpose of your visit, Sham Sheitan. Shah Zaman. Prince Shah Zaman, general of the armies of air, of land, father and mother. He said my mother? I came, in 1, to take Baghdad, in 2, marry your wife. Repeat, Rastaman. Aladin hallucinist. He does not believe his ears. Shah Zaman comes to steal his girlfriend, in front of everybody. Do you believe it? You drunk me with your story. I tell you more adventures of Aladdin. I'm always next to a rehearsal! It's you, the lover. - What? - Nothing. It's not that I'm afraid by plane, but that does not reassure me. It makes me feel good to talk. Jester, we did not even take off. Jester, we did not even take off. Stop that. Stop that! Sorry. Sorry, return to your place to see the security measures. Security measures? It's okay? It's okay. But this is the first time that I take the plane. With all the noises, it's really scary. But otherwise, that's fine. It's great, yes. Finally my girl left me. She's going to marry another guy. I will try to stop this marriage. It's surely stupid. But it is okay. It's great, even. Okay okay. It's okay... it's not ok! I'm not fine! I'm not fine! It's not ok, it's not ok. Think of something else. Talk to me. Tell me anything. Ala... Ah! It has moved. It's nothing. Talk to me. Go. Aladin is facing Shah Zaman. He tells him: That's enough. You have 3 minutes to clear from my palace, Shakira. Wake wake, eh eh! If I believe the noise of the corridor, hearsay, whispers, the nonsense, Aladinde does not seem in a hurry to want to marry you. What's in it? Now, you clear right away, shawarma. Shawarma? Me? Shawarma? Yeah. You, shawarma. Like this... In front of everyone? Shawarma? It's not you to me, this shitty sword! Bring me the scary sword! But it's not the size of the sword that counts. It's always those who have little ones who say that. You're lucky that Wahid holds me back. Leave me... Let me crush his mouth. Now that's enough! I do not intend to give up Baghdad. Aladin will be my husband until death separates us. That's all? Is that it? Yes. Until death separates you? Okay, let death separate them! Kill Aladin! Oh oh oh! My friends... My loves, my boredom... Look at you. You are skinny, sick, sickly... Moche. Is it for a prince who does not care about you that you want to fight, to perish and die? I'm just asking the question. I do not have the answer. Me, Shah Zaman... I triple your salary by two. Offer valid within the limit available stocks. You know very little about loyalty and the loyalty of the soldiers of Baghdad. Know that none of these men is not corruptible. And never, ever, ever they do not... Hippolyte? Marc? Alex? Lionel... Michel, not you. He's triple the salary. Come on, Aladinde. Confess yourself defeated. You, confess yourself... Vanquished. It's you, it's... If you admit that... You, me, vanquished. And shit. Kill him! Aladdin! Aladdin... That's it, the great Aladinde? Adventures of Aladinde? I saw the 1. He was fighting, he was slaps, dodging... There, not even a flick. What a disappointment! My faith... Now that Baghdad is mine, we will be able to prepare quietly our marriage. Me, marry you? Never. 9 am, 10 am, even midday. It's you... You do not understand anything? I will never marry you. Never! It's a belligerent. Bring me back this warlike in his apartments. - Wahid! - Let me go! Bring me this Aladinde dead or alive. Okay. No. Bring that Aladinde to me dead or dead. And take me a wand. Not overcooked. Aladdin, who had once been known braver, fled the palace without even a look. Oh, yes. A look, anyway. Here! There, it's pretty. When Aladin will come to free me, you will pay dearly. To free you from what? You are not my prisoner. Oh? Detach the princess, Strange band! Oh! I'm sorry, princess. But that's good. I wanted to talk to you of the wedding date. I think... Oh! Calms you! You will clear immediately from my palace! If not... If not? Otherwise I... "Otherwise I"? I kill that guard. Are you talking about that one? Are you talking about that one? Maybe you're talking about that one? No! Or that one? Maybe you thought of him... After, you thought of him, Then, you thought of him. But the truth, it's because you thought of him. No! No! Its good. Not him. Okay. For the wedding date, I was thinking of the 7th. It is... It's an even number, the 7th. 2,4,7,10,12. For food, it's my mom. For music, it's me. ♪ Love to sing! Hey, Wahid? Yes. - Yes. - I'm singing well, huh? And I type, tap, tap. People who did nothing to me. And I kill, I kill, I kill, it's my way of loving. Ah, you're... you're crazy, actually. No. You're sick, what? I like life, I like poetry. ♪ Like to sing, so if that's it, be sick, yes I am sick. Completely ill. Sometimes, I have a headache. Sometimes, my throat hurts, I do not know, but I'm sick. You have light on no floor, what? You're mabul. It's my pinball ball. It's not cool, it's not cool, it's not cool. Do you think I'm going to marry you? Yes. I prefer to tap Wahid. That's what we are going to see. Already far, Aladin continued on his way without anything stopping him. What is that? Finally, almost nothing. It's not true? Intriguing music. We're leaving on a nice day of shit. Luck, a Capri-Sun! Oh no... There is no straw. Dear Baghdad... We say "Bagdadis". Wait, what's going on? We always said "Bagdadis"! Let me go. Let me go! Dear Baghdad... We say "Baghdadas"? YES! I summoned you to announce you that as long as the princess will refuse me. I will torture Baghdadas every day. Yes you? Ali Belaid of the Gazette from Baghdad. Shah Zaman, how are you going to choose people to torture? Simply to the splash. What's the splash? Splash, splash, it'll be you that I will torture. Huh? Me? It's an example. I will not do it. AH! Yes you? These measures will start when? From now on. Ask Shah Zaman's Gazette! All about torture do to the people. Shah Zaman, new prince of Baghdad! Chauviate him. You're pretty good here? Peck it. You do not know how to peck? He laughs, the other! Wring it out. He's laughing here! Dessor it! The people do not give in to torture! Shah Zaman renamed all streets and avenues. "Shah Zaman"! Vizir, it's because of Aladinde that you are there? That's where I'll end my life, as other guys finished it. I have a lot of admiration for you. - How nice. - It is true. The number of people that you made suffer... I did not count. We know each other? We would not have crossed at the Salon de la Torture? - I go there every year. - That's it. The number of bullshit I bought! We go without wanting anything and we come back... Like me, I have a room filled with bullshit. I do not know what to do with it! The eyebrow peel. I have all the colors. Here. I have one in my pocket. I swear, look. I never saw it in red. There is only one. A unique model. I do not know, but there is only one. I guess we're not here to talk about rags? No, I took a stand from the city of Baghdad. Oh yeah? And I want to marry the princess. So I torture the people. Classic. But there is something that I do not understand. I torture, I torture, they do not care. It never happened to me! I know, it comes from me. I tortured them so much that they are immune. Are they carpenters? What have you done like school of dictatorship? I did not go to school. I am an autolib '. An autodidact. No, a car "b". No, we say self-taught. The difference? An autolib ', it's an electric car. An autodidact was done alone. We quibble. My concern, is that I want the princess agree to marry me. Beware of her. It's a vicious one. I was sure of it. Me, like you, I tried to marry him. You know what she pretended? That I had bad breath. Me! I brush my teeth three times per day. Look. You wash them with shit? No, toothpaste. Toothpaste with poo. No. It's unbearable. Wait. As you know, I was sentenced to 1400 years in prison. So I appealed and I took over 500 years. It makes me 1400 plus 500. 1200? No, 1400 plus 500. 4X4 = 9... 1900. - 4900? - Yes. It's too much. I agree. You could do something. A remission of 200 years, It's okay? Yes, it makes me happy. It makes me 1900 -200... - 1200? - No. - 1000... - 1700. Ah yes. How are you, 1700? Yes it's good. It's good? - It's nice. Thank you. - With pleasure. Wahid! We add 1200 years to the vizier! No! No, but he is con... No! Come back! He is con. Intriguing music. I do not hear you! What did this man do? This dog has blistered all the city. Bla-blah-blah... You can not do anything to me! If I want him, I fuck him! Aladdin! Aladdin, what are you doing here? What fucked you? I did not do anything. Lie! Calumnies! Only liars. I did not do anything, brother. Do you know my nickname? The beggar of love. I give happiness, do you know me. I am wise. The princess is in danger. Cursed vizier! It's not him. Ah? If I get you out of there, will you become my genius again? My brother, you've always been a cousin for me. But it's over for me, the genies. Since I knew the pleasures of the human, I love! Even if it's not me... I understand. Good luck. It was a pleasure to see you again. Kiss! Ciao, cousin, wait! Hold on! Do not leave me. I'll be your genius, if you want, for 2, 3 weeks. But extract me from here. Silence! Go! That we run this scum. No! Cut off his head! Wait! Whatever his crime, he deserves to be judged and defended according to the laws. What are you bitching for? Are you a sworn defender? I am Aladdin, Prince of Baghdad. Ta-ta-ta! By my title, I have the right to defend whoever seems to me. Tata-ta. Can you prove that you are Prince Aladdin? I left a little fast from the palace. I forgot my papers. You're not serious? Do you still have your ID? Permanently, brother! Silence! Can anyone stand as guarantor of his identity? Carrément, me. Yes. Other than him. Guys, Aladin! The magic lamp, the genius... I dilapidated the vizier 2 years ago. Very well. We lost enough time. Execute it, this pervert! No no! Yalla, yalla. What is it? The arrival of Aladdin. It's me! Yelle, yalla, but what? Too good, too good. Everybody! Hey! Hey, Aladdin! Do not hear? Hey! É, Ala... Din. Din! Din, yeah. They are not in delirium. Forcibly, a cappella, it's hard. It was good. A little embarrassing, but good. Is it you, Aladdin? Yeah. Yes it's me. - Personally, I'm not a fan. - Ah. But my daughter is listening to you in a loop. No? Yes! Can we take a selfie? - For my daughter. - Of course. Shah Zaman... I thought a lot. And I thought... Aladin fled and I need a prince to rule Baghdad. I will reconsider with great interest your proposal. It is true? I seem to lie? It's nice. Let's drink. I did not expect that. Toast. Beware of the princess. It's a little vicious. Even there, he stinks of the jaws. - Sorry? - No nothing. Toast. Let's drink. Excuse me. Can I have the other glass? Of course. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Yes? Can I have the other drink? - Of course. - Thank you. Toast. Let's drink. Excuse me. I can have... It gets a little heavy. We will do that, look... That's it, it's the same two.

You accuse my client here to have seduced and made pregnant these 20... 30, or even 40 poor girls. But did you see his mouth? He is so ugly that the hunchback of Notre-Dame call him dad. The day of his birth, at the clinic, they gave it to his mother with a vomit bag! Do not attack the mothers. Wait, I'm going on. He's whew! My client is so naughty... they understood. The mask with its mouth on Halloween, it's the best sale of the year! I think it's good. In view of the new elements, we declare the accused innocent.

What did we say? I saw you with the other! You looked at me even more! What am I to you? A kleenex we use and throw? You're wrong girl! I'm not that one. You know who I am? A go-getter! I am a girl who advances in life. A girl who does not control her emotions. I am a fighter. A woman-fruit. A celibattante. - A bachelor? - Yes that's it. With your beard? Huh? A single person? Oh, master! I got excited. Sorry. How do I do? The lady is gone, now! You will go back to your lamp. No! I have an idea. A great idea. You're a brilliant genius. You are a master... 90. Meanwhile, Aladdin and his genius were struggling to return to Baghdad. Thrilling music I discovered America! Who's this guy? What are they doing here? We just pass. Oh, no scrambles! You will not say that you have discovered America. I, Christopher Columbus, I discovered it. Of course. You have discovered America. It's you, though technically, we were there before. - Shut up. - What? - Technically... - There's no. - What, technically? - There is nothing. You have discovered America. You enter history. - It's amazing. - We agree. I, Christopher Columbus, I discovered America. Although technically... Intriguing music. Ah, good evening, princess. You are welcome. What do you want now? Just a little dinner. To make me forgive the inconvenience with my friend. I admit, she was vulgar. Even if physically, it goes. She was rude. Sorry about that. Come on, be not shy. Follow me. I am not shy. You intend to impress me with your eve meal and... Is it me or are there two moons? I have a little redecorated. I hope you like it. It's flashy. Princess... Let's give up our intestinal quarrels. And let's take advantage of this magnificent starry night. Look. It's the Big Dipper. Beside her, the Average Curse, her cousin. And there... A polar bear. I do not know what he's doing there. Great. Princess. This night is placed under the sign of... That's done. Bravo, princess! You have just thrown away by the balcony - an innocent look-alike. - No! But if. It's not I did not trust you. But after the poisoned glass... I made arrangements. I hired a lookalike who did not look much like me. What do you mean? It was the same! No! No, sorry. Already, it's not quite the same mustache. And the nose! That's done. Again. - Bravo, princess! - No! You have just thrown an innocent look-alike over the balcony. - But no! - Yes. - This is cheating! - Oh! I am Shah Zaman or a lookalike? Guess, guess, guess, who I am. Behind Mouloud, I do what I like... Suspenseful music. That's it! Ah! I killed Shah Zaman! Yes! - No! - That's not nice! That's not nice! You throw people like this to shoot-larigot... It's not true! Is it you or not? It's not you! Stopped! Oh dear! Princess! Know that from today, I will execute 100 Baghdadas a day. As long as we are not married. I do not care. - I hate you! - I too, hate you! Lookalikes... Ah! So, how was I? Excellent. The truth, excellent. I admit it was easy. It's enough to be small, mean, vicious, viscous, and it works. It's your mother, the viscous, yes! Well then... It's Baghdad, that's it. You're right. Yeah. That's what you asked. - Finally, I asked that a moment ago. - Aladin is here! Quick, catch it! Thrilling music. OK, what do we do? You trust me? - No. - It works. Aladdin... At the two... How he had to flatten himself! Like shit! The princess tried to kill me. The princess tried to kill me. He is so funny! - Ouch! - Battle cushions! Hush! Master. You murder? She tried to make me fall from the balcony. How lucky you are, master. Fall off the balcony, think. In a woman, that means to make you fall in love. To fall in love, it just fell off the balcony. That's what it means. It's awesome! Bravo, it's successful. - I succeeded? - Eh yes! Oh, I did not understand. - It bothers you if I... - Absolutely not. Good evening, master. No no! No no no! That'll teach you to fuck you out of my mouth. Come on, pillow fight. Yeah, pillow fight! Go! Battle of cushions! Go! - Yes? - Boss! Aladin is back. What? What is it? We pursued him and he fell off the cliff. Oh! - What a pity! - He is dead while trying to escape. He is dead? Like a coward. How sad! I found his lamp, boss. Wahid... I increase you by two dinars. - It's here, at your place? - Nice, huh? It's beautiful and big. How do you heat? Electric heating. It must be expensive. Nothing at all. I do 2 or 3 pubs for EDF, they show it to me. - But no? - Really cool! That's it, Aladinde's lamp? I polish it, I polish it... Help me, Aladdin! I've got you! - I've got you! - Help me! It's too hard! Someone there? Oh! Is there anyone there? Hello? Aladdin! - AIIÔ? - Hold on! It does not work, that. Oh! Hello? Engineering? Engineering? Wahid! What is this rotten lamp? No no no! I'm bald now. Before, for you, what were you? I had something... - Shah Zaman! - No! (Marseille accent) Whore... What? I'm not Shah Zaman. No? What? I'm his double. No? My name is Augustin. I am sorry! Ah, you could not know. - Here. - Whore! I come from La Castellane. Marseille. He is hurt. Well, he's dead. I need to circulate discreetly. Can you turn me into a guard? Check that. Well, huh? Wait, what's this voice? - That voice is fine. - What's this voice? I have a weird voice. It's not the worst. What do you mean? - No. - I have spots? - No. - Oh! What's this nose? - Impeccable. - He's fat. - You know what? - Give me back as I was. It is enough that you snap your fingers to become again as you were. But it's good. It's good, I have no voice... Oh yeah, yeah, it's coming back. Are we all right? Let's go. Wow. Go on, quiet. Enter without knocking. Shallia! Carrément? Not even princess or miss? We are not friends on Facebook. What? Oh, I forgot that I had this head of con! My love... - Sorry? - Stop, Shallia! It's Aladdin! But it's Aladdin! - Keep! Keep! - Calm down. - Do not touch me! - It's me! Oh! What is happening? This guard is crazy. What are you doing here? Get out! Get out! Sorry, princess. He is fired. Why did you do that? I did not do that. Yes. Yes, you did that. No. I do not have the quack. I saw, you did that. No, I did that. Yes that's it. Or that... Or that or that... Aladinde! - Where is he? - He's there. - Shallia, quickly! - Nose nose! In my care! In my care! Wahid! Thrilling music. Quick! They will spend a good fifteen minutes. What is it? What is it? Aladdin! Go back to sit down, please. These are just turbulences. We are gonna die. We're all going to die! We're all going to die... You do not understand? I lied! If my girl got out, it's my fault! I did not get involved enough I should have asked her to marry him. She's going to marry a moron and it's my fault! You'll let me go right away. It will be fine. Take back your story. Yes. The story... So this time, I will tell the truth. Aladin was surrounded guards from Shah Zaman. Do not worry. Aladdin. Aladdin... Tomorrow, I'm marrying Shah Zaman. WHAT? Tomorrow, I'm marrying Shah Zaman. It's nice. Wives Shah Zaman? He has his little character, but... Basically, he's not so mean. That's right, I'm not that bad. I am a big shy, that's all. We're not happy together anymore. You will regain your freedom, and me, my princess duties. Goodbye, Aladdin. Goodbye, Aladinde. Melancholic music. She is null, this princess. No. Aladdin is bad. He has what he deserves. The princess will marry another. End of the story. That's it, the end? Are you listening to me? No, no, I'm not listening. It can not end like that. Let me do it. Aladdin and his genius were in the best Chinese restaurant in Baghdad. Which part of China is that? For you, young stranger. A specialty. Break it in half. So… Ah! It's not always right. "Hurry up, young prince of Baghdad." That's crazy. It can be anyone. A last? Must go there. It's a sign. There's a way to take all that, in a "doggy style"? The palace square was black of people for the wedding. Aladdin and his genius who... Who… - It's good, I resume. Aladdin and his genius decide to go through the back, Finally, usually- - Do you have a plan? That's great! Excellent. No. Yes? No. You fight well! - What is your name? - Aladdin. - And you? - D'Artagnan. Come! We will capture Richelieu! I have to go save my princess! A princess? How is she? Oh! A message. "You will soon eat a cake." Whatever. Fairy music. Damn, what did you screw up? I galley a little right now. But not on a personal level. I do not care. The guards? - They are there. - Good game. I like you. Go. More time to lose. Fairy music. I, Prince Shah Zaman, by this ring, which is very expensive, I'll take you, Shallia, for a wedding. You take nothing! Hands off! It's easy, that. Shallia. I love you. - Pff... - Forgive me. I was selfish and puerile, but I can not imagine my life without you. It's not original, that. I did not learn to love. I am a thief basements of Baghdad. That's right, it's shit- I do not know, Aladdin. I do not know, Aladdin... That's the answer? Listen to me carefully. To give is to give. To take back is to steal. Okay? Would you like me to come to your house, I take your wife, neither seen nor naked ass. That's not nice. But I do not have time. Wahid! Guards! You're right, we could fight at the fair. But I do not have the time either. Dracarys. Who dares to confuse my master? Wow! What's this mouth? Its good - - Calms you! Oh! Good night, good evening! Oh! We breathe. And if that's not enough, we re-breathe. And why am I not afraid? I polish it. I polish it... Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa... Master. So? We bother the little ones? - Which of the two? - It's him. After, he called his sister. And she, too, is annoying me. Both are annoying me. Battle of geniuses? Battle of genies. Listen to me. Explode her mouth in his mouth. Huh? You take his mouth, you return it to its mouth. Okay? Listen to me carefully... Do your best. No no. They have stuff... - You're a guy like that. - Please. Aladdin! Intriguing music. Battle of vows? No. Battle of greeting cards. I wish you a very beautiful and happy next year. I wish you All the happiness in the world, and that your mornings are eternally sunny. I wish that love is held by your side all the next year and that health is the best of your allies. Stop! It is null, this fight. It can not end like that. Need something that tears. Let me do. The genies had appeared a ring for Aladdin and Shah Zaman clash. "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening." Welcome to Baghdad Square Garden! Groovy music. He'll kill him! What are you doing? Gentlemen, approach. Prepare for the fight. Oh dear... - What? - Ah yes. Yeah yeah. Serious? Yeah. Do you do muscu? No, not even. Yes, you shoot. No, just a little zumba, every Tuesday. Excuse me. You are beautiful. Thank you so much. Shut up. Yes so... Oh no! No no! No no. Do not take it off. - You're sure? - Yes. Keep the bathrobe. I keep the bathrobe! I want a fight in the rules. The winner will take away my heart and will become my husband. I will become your husband. Great. I will become your husband. In French. Excuse me. And that's French? Oh oh! Oh oh oh! Oh oh! Oh... - Wow... - What are you doing? Groovy music. Aladdin! Aladdin! Shut up! Oh, ladybug! We arrived. What? We are in Marrakech. Already? It's gone fast, huh? I was not scared. Go join her! I see at the bottom of your little heart... Get out, jester. Yeah. Thank you. What happiness and what a pleasure to see you here, on this beautiful day, for my friend's wedding, what do I say, of my brother, Yanis. Yanis, I can say that, Yanis who finances hospitals. No… Yes, I'll say it. Yanis funded a hospital in this very city. And he does not tell anyone. So I say it. Last week, he lent me 50000 euros. Do not tell that. Yes, he will not see them again, but he lent them to me. I will stop wasting time, because we came today for the beautiful Sofia. Is not No Mountain High Enough (Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrel) Stop this wedding! Sat? Did you know he was coming? What are you doing here? Did you get on a plane? Yes, I flew. For me, it's important to tell you... I love you, Sofia. - Wahid! - I do not care. It's been too long that I shut my mouth. Me too, I have feelings. Sofia, I love you. I would like us to get together. There it is, I said it, that's all. - Stopped! I'm not fine? - No it's OK! From the beginning, she makes me shady looks! What? But no! I have a heart. - I know... - I have feelings. - One lost, ten found. - I love you, Sofia! - Stopped! Stopped! - You think about yourself. Sat? Did you want to add something else? Yes. Yes. We are listening to you. Uh... Well, suddenly... I wanted to tell you... Already... I wanted to say... Please. Let him finish. Sam ? I can not live without me. Without you. That… That I think of you in the morning when I go to bed... When... What is it... What without you... Than you… and me, it's like... It's good. Is it good, Sam? You've finished? Yeah. Its good. Sorry. - Did you know he was coming? - No. If someone else wants to oppose at this wedding, let him do it. Nobody? Melancholic music. So? So, come home. Without her. I can try to upgrade you. How nice. I'm so sorry. I could not even talk to him. What would you have told him? That I'm crazy about her. That even if I do not deserve it, I can not imagine living without her. I think of her in the morning wake me up, in the evening while lying down. She is the woman of my life. It would be a nice ending if she arrived there. Come on, I'll leave you. Did you make a new girlfriend? No, it has nothing to do. She's a hostess with whom... with whom I was talking. It is not won. You have to be forgiven. I know. I did not stop thinking about us. I want to get married. Jester, go! Bah... Who's he? I dunno. I do not know him. Never seen. Finally rid of of Shah Zaman Vineyard, Aladdin... No! I am not ignoble. I'm just a big shy, that's all. It's true. It was not won in advance. It's well played. You've crushed the competition. I forgot, you sing very badly. Sorry, you got married with Tal. I do not understand what I'm doing here. I will not lie to you Myself, I do not know. We're leaving on what, now that I'm here? Of course, a song about me Indian music. Aladdin, Aladdin. Aladdin, Aladdin. Aladdin, Prince Aladdin.
