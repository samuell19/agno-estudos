I didn't know. I lived and I breathed this shit. [reporter 2] Who is it that you would like to say, "I told you so?" [man 4] Give it up for y'all niggas! Kanye did it, from Chicago, motherfuckers. Hey, Kanye! [Kanye] It was like God saying, "I'm about to hand you the world." "Just know, at any time, I could take it away from you." [Coodie] Belief is the power that fuels your purpose. [Kanye] ♪ Slice like a pizza ♪ [Coodie] From where our story first began in Chicago, to the dream that pushed him to move to New York. My first year documenting Kanye West was much more than I could have ever imagined. And when he landed a deal with Roc-A-Fella Records, the real work was about to begin. [Dame] Thank y'all for coming. A lot of things going on in Roc-A-Fella. All right, so let's do some questions. [Coodie] I heard you mention a new artist, Kanye West. What's some of your plans for him? I mean, Kanye is definitely a Roc-A-Fella. He's an entrepreneur. He's promoting himself as we speak. [Coodie] The lighting is great. [indistinct chatter] Wanna share that look, fool? Face fat as fuck. Can you hold this for a second? [Dame] Every time I see him, he has somebody with him. He has a fucking camera with him. And he does really good music. Kanye, why don't you come up and answer the question? Whatever he wants to do, he can do. Yo, I definitely think I'm bringing, uh, an entire new market to Roc-A-Fella. 'Cause I rap the exact image that I look like. What I go through. And a lot of people be like, "Damn. I actually go through that." I'm not in the streets like that. I'm not really that rich. [Coodie] I'm driving this. I'm driving that. Kanye, you about to get them keys. So you brought my man a Benz, huh? - His G-Wagon. - [Coodie] Yeah. [car dealer] 12,000 a month? [Kanye] Because I went through the struggle of being broke, I'm like anybody sitting here. I got to work him up to the new car we're getting, the Maybach. It starts at 300. [Coodie] 300? He'll be able to get it next year, for sure. 'Cause I feel like it's a market. I feel like we gonna go ten million with what I've got to say. [Dame] We should all give him a big round of applause. [applause] [imperceptible] [Coodie] Thing was, even though Kanye was finally a Roc-A-Fella artist, it still felt like he was on the sideline trying to figure out how to get into the game. People know about the beats, but to me… I love doing beats. I ain't frontin', but that was like an internship for me. I ain't the number one producer. I'm a rapper. Put me in the ranks of the rappers. [Coodie] He made it this far, but he still had a lot to prove if he was ever gonna get his moment to shine. [indistinct chatter] [man 1] Let's go! [indistinct chatter] Let's go! Let's go! ♪ Peedi, Peedi I heard that they got your number ♪ ♪ The alias you've been living under The mack goes… ♪ [rapping indistinctly] [Coodie] What're you saying, Ye?

[scattered cheering] [indistinct chatter] I'm saying the best rapper-producer in the game. I'm cosigning here. Look, Gary. "Big Face" Gary, Roc-A-Fella. I'm cosigning. Best rapper-producer in the fucking game. It means nothing to be the best rapper-producer... - It means a lot. - It don't. 'Em niggas is weak. If you say "best rapper-producer," he get mad at me. I keep saying best rapper-producer. He mad. No, man. That's like saying, "best kid rapper." Or the "best female emcee." Well, Kan, they don't know about you. No. [hesitates] Wherever I'm at with all the other rappers… If I'm the 50th rapper, I'm a rapper. Fuck producing. I'm two different persons... Wanna know about your beats? Fuck your beats. I'm saying I do beats, but I'm competing against these niggas. I ain't trying to compete against no producers. I'm listening to what Hov doing. Can I get a beat? He's giving his beats now. Producer on our label, I ain't get a beat from him yet. Hey, Peedi. C'mon man. This Peedi. This his first debut. [indistinct chatter] [Coodie] The reality was, a rapper like Peedi Crakk was a great fit for Roc-A-Fella's image. And deal or no deal, the label still saw Kanye as a producer first. [Gary] What's going on here? This song gonna break Peedi Crakk wide open. Dame want his album already. My man Kanye want to go to LA and work with him. Give him some heat. [Mac] Well, me too! Okay. Well, we all going! We going to LA, Mac. We going to LA. [Coodie] But even though the Roc was trying to box him in, Kanye made sure to create opportunities for himself. So while Jay-Z was in the studio working on Blueprint 2, Kanye asked Jay if he could spit a verse with the hopes of being featured on the album. If he couldn't convince Jay-Z that he can really rap, Roc-A-Fella might not ever take him seriously as an artist.

[chuckling] [imperceptible] [Coodie] For years, everybody told Kanye to just stick to the beats. Now he had a feature with one of the greatest emcees to ever touch the mic. Jay, whatchu got to say about Ye West? Ye West! Hot! Fire! - Put my money on him. [chuckles] - [Coodie] Aight. That cosign from Jay-Z was huge.

But first, Roc-A-Fella sent him to LA to work on that music for Peedi Crakk. We thought it would be a quick trip. But then I got the news that would change everything. Hip-hop producer Kanye West was injured when his car crashed in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, early Wednesday morning. [reporter continues indistinctly] [Coodie] Kanye was driving back to his hotel after a late-night studio session when he crashed his car. [glass shatters] And almost lost his life. [man] With God's blessings… [Donda] You need an angel to watch over you. [Coodie] I was relieved when Mama West called me and said that Kanye survived. But when she told me he broke his jaw in three places… [EKG beeping] …I was afraid he would never rap again. [Kanye] I'm a motherfucking rapper. I got some songs in my heart. [Coodie] It felt like everything he'd worked so hard for… was over. [man] Kanye! [indistinct chatter] [EKG beeping] [phone ringing] [Coodie] A few weeks later, Kanye called me. With his mouth wired shut. And I was shocked when he started rapping a new song over the phone, called "Through the Wire." Because of the pain he was in, the doctors had urged him not to travel. But they couldn't stop him from working. The way he saw it, the music he was making for his album was life-changing. And he told me he needed me in LA. I was on a plane the next day. [camcorder beeps] [woman] Before we get started, we want to send a shout-out to music producer Kanye West. He's fine, but he was in a car accident. So we just want to send him our best. We hope he gets better soon. And keeps doing those hot beats. [rap song playing over speakers] [Kanye] I got some old-school shit. We gonna make it look hot though. Yo, Greg. You want to just chill here? We just going to the dentist. Do you want to chill here? 'Cause we going to the dentist! - My teeth are all fucked up. - [Coodie] Mmm-mmm. Missing a bracket here. [Coodie] Oh, shit. I'm going to this wack-ass dentist right now, which got referred to me by Cedars-Sinai Hospital. - [Coodie] What's up, shorty? - What type of camera is that? - Wait. A Canon... - Canon GL1. You use MiniDVs? - Yeah. - You good with Final Cut Pro? I mean… Like, I'm not good at editing, but… - You good… Okay. - [Coodie] But I… I'm a good director. [woman] Okay. [Coodie] Where your picture at, Kanye? [Kanye] I'm still working. [humming] - [dentist 1] Why are you filming? - [Coodie] This is my documentary. [dentist 1] No. We're gonna take the wires out for you, right? - Yeah. - You're gonna film that? Yeah, what's wrong? - [chuckles] You cannot do that. - Why not? - No. Because... - It's illegal? [dentist 1] Yeah. For real? Your jaw surgery should not be, um… cannot be done until your jaw heals, which takes a couple of months. [Kanye] You told me three weeks last time. No. I did not say… Three weeks is… Well, I mean, it's healed in terms of… It is sticking. But it's not healed enough to rebreak the jaw to fix the teeth. You see what I'm saying? [Kanye] All right. - You're not "healed" healed. - Yeah. In my opinion, you should have physical therapy to get the jaw mobilized. That is job one. Because, unfortunately, your jaw is broken way up high here. - All right. - Okay? So if you don't mobilize it, it's gonna get stuck. Let me see your bite. Let me just take a bite. [Kanye] I, uh… I have a video shoot in January. [dentist 1] You have video shoot in January? Okay. I was supposed to have one in December, but will my mouth look somewhat normal? - Even though my bite is off. - Well, that is not possible. That will not be possible. Bite. All the way. Good. Keep it like that. Don't open. [Kanye humming] [dentist 1] Okay. You won't be able to get your jaw fixed in January. So, you know, I mean… You can have a video shoot. You're having one now. Right? But I wanna have one when I look good. - You look pretty good. - [chuckles] You look good enough. I wanna be to my fullest. - Okay? All right? - [Kanye] All right. [Coodie] Your video period can be a lot of the documentary. - We could do one... - "Through the Wire." What I'm thinking is we do one right now. 'Cause, this little… Taking this off looks like I'm taking the wires off. - You know what I'm saying? - Yeah. It look like they putting 'em on. Yeah. You could put that shot and that little talking there in the video. It could show him talking… Have little excerpts over the chorus part? - [Coodie] Mmm-hmm. - [dentist 1] Open a little bit for me. Believe me. The wider you open, the less you feel. Just a little pinch here. Don't move. Relax. Relax your face. You okay? Almost done with the shots. Okay? [Coodie] "He crying on TV?" Yeah, crying on TV. What's this? You know? All your fans expect you not to cry. Expect you to be brave. You know? Okay. Okay. We'll let you rest here for a while. I have to go, so the other doctor will take it out for you. Okay? - [Kanye] That's pretty good. - [dentist 1] Hmm? Okay. [muffled] I can't even talk. - [Coodie] Damn, your shit numb? - Mmm-hmm. [dentist 2] If you feel it, let me know. Okay? [grunts] [speaking indistinctly] You know what I'm saying? [Coodie chuckling] No. We don't know what you're saying. [dentist 2] It's coming out. [emotional music playing] Coming through. Okay. - [Kanye] Can I keep these? - [dentist 2] Yeah. Why don't we wash them off and give them to you? All right? No. My mother wants to keep the blood on them. - [dentist 2] Hmm? - My mama wants to keep the blood on them. - [dentist 2] What for? - That's just how she wants them. - [dentist 2] Who? - My mama. My mother. - [dentist 2] Your who? - My mother. She saves this stuff. [Coodie] Feeling like he had just a small window of time to get his career to the next level, it was hard for Kanye to face the reality that his recovery would take so long. Despite the frustration and pain, he was determined to make the best of it. [indistinct chatter] Now picture this with gums around it though. And then they're fangs. I'mma fuck this up right here. [man] That's gonna come off. - Don't let go when you pull it out. - That shit was shaked a lot. [man] Hold on to it. - Yeah. It ain't gonna pop. - Whoo! [indistinct chatter] Man, we is big ballers. We go out with the best. [laughter] [speaking indistinctly] - [Coodie] How you doing? - You guys ready? Let me get cheese fries with Cajun fries under the cheese. With more cheese than normal. A lot of cheese. Get me the mashed potatoes with the country gravy. And that is all. I already eaten corn and potatoes today. Man, I lost a lot of weight. I feel good. I gotta be lifting my shirt up around here. [indistinct chatter] You know, I lost a lot of weight. [laughter] - Let me see. - [Coodie] Look. They played a nigga, dawg. I'm like, "I'm motherfucking Coodie, nigga." "Channel motherfucking Zero." I'm like, "Nigga, you don't know Channel Zero?" That motherfucker said, "No." [laughter] I said, "Well, I was on BET." [laughter] [Kanye] What's this nigga doing right there? UCLA students right there. [Coodie] Let me see. Y'all see A Beautiful Mind? [woman laughing] [indistinct chatter] [Coodie] Some more cheese? See, I can't really chew 'cause I was in an accident. - So they gotta melt this down some more. - [waitress] Melt it? [waitress laughing] [man] Go over there and get a magazine called Mass Appeal. Just take your time and fan through it until you see a full page ad on him. And then you're gonna realize. We believe you! [chuckles] [man] Find out who that dude is, 'cause we want y'all to get the album when it comes out. For real. College students. [Coodie] Stay in school. Don't drop out like Kanye did. [Coodie] Since I had gotten to LA, I barely had time to put my bags down and we were already on the move. After the accident, Roc-A-Fella put The College Dropout on the shelf. We didn't know when they were going to release it. But Kanye was motivated more than ever. So he called in favors to at least get the album recorded. [Kanye] We can load it up. Track number two. Y'all have the light dimmed or something? - How do you say it? Kanye... - Kanye. - Kanye? - Yeah. [man] You got a title for it? Um… Yeah. Call it "Slow Jamz." Hey, Foxx. Tell him what your concept is, Kanye. - [Jamie] What? - Here it is. [Kanye] My concept for the song… They gonna say… The girls will be like, "I feel this concept and this rapping." "But sometimes I need, um…" "I need some slow shit. I need some dusties." - "I need some…" - [Jamie] Whoo! - We just got through talking about this! - That's what I told him.

Thank God he had his studio in his crib because Roc-A-Fella wouldn't open up Kanye's recording budget. So to keep making his album, he had to borrow studio time from other artists whenever he could. [indistinct chatter] [Kanye] Uh, Pharrell's supposed to give us ten minutes with Luda. - [man 1] Yeah. - [Kanye] Um… We haven't heard anything about you guys using...

As long as you keep that… The conduit between those two places clear, for that energy to come through, you gonna always be ill for the rest of your life. I can tell when a nigga is really hot. But I can tell when they have the potential to become complacent. [Kanye] Mmm-hmm. You do not have that. But the only thing I'm saying is that… Once niggas tell you you hot, still doubt yourself. [Kanye] Yeah. [emotional music playing] [Coodie] Very rarely do you encounter self-contained people. And not, "I can do everything myself." This man can do everything himself. That is truly gifted. The fact that this nigga chose to highlight this crazy, catastrophic thing that happened to him about six weeks ago, that's real right there.

So I was sitting up in a hospital bed for the first seven days. And I was just be watching TV, man. I just came to some revelation. People were like, "You almost died. What came from this?" And I just sit back and just decided that I was gonna be the best… The best-dressed rapper in the game. Because I was watching nigga's gear. It's like crazy wack, you know? ♪ Keep 'em high ♪ ♪ Now, my flow ♪ ♪ Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics ♪ ♪ I can't call it I got the swerve like alcoholics ♪ ♪ My freshman year I was going through hella problems ♪ ♪ Still I built up the nerve To drop my ass up outta college ♪ People used to tell me not to rap. Now, if I don't got the best voice and I don't have this hard image, or I don't have a jail record or whatever. Some people are saying these are reasons why I can't rap. Rap, for me, is just an extension of the expression I got from doing my music. I can only express about 50%. It's ideas that I have that I can't make Jay-Z do. So I'm going there like, "How can even Kevin Liles tell me that I can't be a rapper?" But he don't realize what I have in me. I have the ability to learn. I might not learn myself up into DMX status by that time. But believe me, if I'm sitting in the studio with Jay-Z and Ludacris and Scarface every day, you think I'mma learn? You think my beats sounded like Blueprint when I started? I'm saying, this is the point I'm at. You can give me a deal for 200-something thousand dollars now and I'mma make you $10 million later. Or you can wait. You know what I'm saying? 'Cause what Def Jam does… They wait until you proving yourself. [Coodie] But waiting wasn't an option. We needed to get Roc-A-Fella's attention. And the best way to do that was to get the world to know Kanye's story. We knew a music video for "Through the Wire" could do just that. One idea for the video was for me to capture people's reactions while Kanye rapped the song to them for the first time. ["Through the Wire" playing over stereo] [Kanye] Did you get that? Hit record?

[song continues playing faintly] [Coodie] Me and DeRay came up together doing comedy back home. Chicago is a big part of all of our stories. And Kanye wanted that energy felt on his album. You want me to specifically write a song for the kids to sing for graduation? I was like, "I got the perfect song for the kids to sing." [imitating old man] Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute? Think you about to do something for the kids for graduation to sing? [grunts] - [laughter] - [man] Damn. He killed that, man. [Coodie] One thing about us guys from the Chi, whenever we crossed paths in other cities, we did what we could to help each other win. ["The Bounce" playing over speakers] - Hey, fast-forward.

And without Dame Dash's support, nothing was gonna change. [indistinct chatter] I know Roots. [man yelling, speaking indistinctly] [Kanye] There's my nigga.

Kanye's album wasn't a priority to Roc-A-Fella. Despite all the great music he was creating, it felt like the accident had killed all the momentum he had built with the Roc. Leaving him back to making beats to support his career. [woman 1 singing] [woman 2] ♪ I'm all crushed, setbacks ♪ ♪ I'll do a comeback ♪ ♪ Taking stride Love the devotion ♪ ♪ Don't confide… ♪ [man] Kanye, the song is coming together.

What is it anyway? What's it for? "Through the Wire." For the video, we just use pieces of the documentary. - That's dope. - Yeah. - We told him. - Yeah. We got this part with Pharrell. He hear the song and he just go crazy. Ran out the room and start singing… [muttering] "Through the wire." But it looked ill on the camera. We got this one comedian DeRay, he's like, "Man, you made me wanna get in an accident." ♪ "Without a arm I spit Without a arm I spit" ♪ ♪ "Without a arm I spit My nigga hold it" ♪ [Coodie] Now that we had all the scenes for the "Through the Wire" video, we needed help pulling off the vision. So we reached out to Chike Ozah, a director and graphic artist who we met in the halls of MTV, to help us make it happen. [Chike] Trying to do a good job between me, Coodie and Kanye, that we're on the same exact page. I cannot find anyone to redo my logo for me. I went to art school and now I don't know any artists. [Chike] Any artists. [man 1] Let's look at the storyboards. See what we got. [man 2] Silent in three, dawg. - [faint laughter] - [man 2] Quiet on the set, please. [faint chatter] [Coodie] Hey, light… Light, folks. [chuckling] Went for hours and hours 'cause he ran out of money and time. Gotta call it a wrap. No, we gotta get it right, Chike. Come on. This is it. This is the one. ["Through the Wire" playing over speakers] [song fades] [pensive music playing] [Coodie] That's how it go. - Chike. - Yo. [Coodie] Was some old shot of Pharrell. He dancing. Then it pull out. When it pull out like this Pharrell will end up over there or something. 'Cause it's the motion that's… And you see this. Action. [Coodie] Knowing he couldn't rely on the label, Kanye did everything in his power to build his own buzz. Um… Aight, this my demo for Def Poetry Jam. I'm gonna start off with this joint I got, it's called "Self-Conscious." This my next selection. It's called "Hey, Mama." And hopefully, y'all can help me out with it. ♪ Hey, Mama ♪ - Let's try it out. - [phone ringing] Man.

You did. - I was… Did you hear me? - I did. I was like, "Kanye! All right! Give it up!" [laughing] You said some heavy political stuff in between. Yeah. 'Cause then everybody thought it was gonna be weak. But you said, "I wanna be the best-dressed rapper." And then you came on with another whole type of rap. About, you know, being self-conscious. Yeah. It was together. I was like, "Oh, snap." [both laughing] [Coodie] After filming for Def Poetry Jam, it felt like things were finally starting to move in the right direction for Kanye. We were almost done with the video for "Through the Wire." And with no budget, Chike was getting us in at MTV after hours so we could use their equipment to finish it. And I couldn't wait for Mama West to see what we'd been working on. Yeah, it's where we shooting the video. Putting it down. [Donda] That you on there, huh, Kanye? [Kanye] This my mother right here. - Hello. - [Donda] Hi. Nice to meet you. What's that you're doing, Kanye? Which one? Which video is this? - [Kanye] "Through the Wire." - [Donda] Oh, really? Hey, where's that one? The picture that I took of him with the big jaw? That. That's my handiwork, isn't it, Kanye? - You took that picture? - [Donda] Yeah. - [man] It's gonna get in there real nice. - [laughter] [Kanye] That's right on the part about Tom Cruise from Vanilla Sky. That's when you on there. Can you make them… You can't make them move some more? - [man] Yeah. - [Coodie] They gonna be moving more. It's off the beat of the song anyway.

We can schedule you for surgery, but we have to plan on it ahead of time. So when do you want to do this? 6th of April? [dentist 1] Well, it can't be that early. Give me a month or two of advance notice. [Kanye] For real? This is one of my main problems. - How far this sticks out. - [dentist 1] Hmm. And it didn't used to stick out like this. [dentist 1] But we cannot bring that down. There's no way to bring it in? 'Cause this is messing me up. You know what I'm saying? Visually. 'Cause I'm an entertainer. I'm an attractive guy, and this is like… I'd have to cut over there. It would leave a scar. Have to cut over here. But you'll have a scar here. - For real? - And there's the nerves there. It's risky. You may end up losing facial expression. - I wouldn't do that. - Wow. [emotional music playing] [Coodie] It had been five months since the accident. And after working so hard to get his career back on track, we were hoping for some good news. But the surgery Kanye needed would put him out of pocket for way too long. With all the plans he had for getting his album out, he decided not to get the surgery, knowing he couldn't afford to miss a beat.

And thanks to that, Kanye got his release date. And Roc-A-Fella opened up the budget for his album. [people applauding] [Dame] And introducing this next artist, I've got a story, I won't be up here long, but I want you to know how we feel about this man at the Roc. When he used to come and make his beats, he used to be like, "Yo, I rap." I'm not gonna lie, I never paid much attention. I was like, "All right." "Stick to the beats, kid." You know? That kind of thing? What I thought he was gonna do was make an album and put a bunch of guests on it. But obviously, he had something different in mind. I liked that he never tried to be like anybody. He was intent on being original and doing things his way. And on another level, he's always controlled his own destiny. [Coodie] We had worked so hard to introduce Kanye to the world and now the world could understand why.

To make this the best year that ever was for everybody on the team. - Yeah! - All right! - 2004! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year, everybody. - All right. [Coodie] From this point on, none of us knew exactly what to expect. - [Donda] We got ten… - [all] Ten, nine, eight, seven… [Coodie] With the album finally coming out… [all counting down] …it felt like our lives were about to change.

[cheering continues faintly] [pensive music playing] [crowd cheering] [imperceptible] [crowd cheering loudly] [TV host 1] Our next guest is an acclaimed record producer whose debut solo CD is titled The College Dropout. Please welcome Kanye West, everyone. [woman 1] Instead of just producing, Kanye West is generating the biggest buzz in the biz because he's writing and recording his own hits. [woman 2] Part showman, part businessman and all talent, rap artist Kanye West will take center stage… [woman 3] …so hot right now. Give it up for Kanye West. [TV host 2] Tonight's musical guest. Make some noise for Kanye West. [Kanye] I used this entire album as, uh, my rehabilitation. Instead of staying at the hotel, I snuck in. And I made songs that inspired me. Songs that gave me life. I feel like this album was kind of like my angel that helped heal me. It revived my spirits. [pensive music playing] [Coodie] The impact of The College Dropout forever changed the culture. But it felt like the bigger Kanye got, the further we grew apart. And when Kanye went on tour without me, I knew I needed to start making time for myself. My mother and father are visiting. Go ahead, Daddy. Maybe this thing. I get you all at this thing. [Coodie] Fine. One thing my mother and father taught me was that everything happens for a reason. So no matter what, always keep moving. With Kanye out on the road, other artists started reaching out for me and Chike to direct their videos. - [Chike] Look at your man, Coodie. - [Coodie speaking indistinctly] Any videos we do, we're writing that motherfucking shit. - That's how it goes. Tell 'em, Chike. - Yes, sir. [pensive music continues] ["Ordinary People" playing] [singing indistinctly] So, this is the first day, Coodie. The first day of the John Legend Get Lifted album.

So I'm just going to hold the camera and then he gonna be like, "Point it over here." And I'm like… "Point it over there." "Point it over here." Yeah. God is doing it. God is directing this. [dramatic music playing] [Coodie] G-O-D. [imperceptible] While me and Chike were making a name for ourselves, Kanye's third single, "Jesus Walks," became a cultural phenomenon. Before his accident, I wrote a video idea for the song. But Kanye was still set on using more established directors. Man, Coodie called me. He was like, "We shooting 'Jesus Walks.'" I'm like, "Didn't Kanye already shoot 'Jesus Walks'?" He was like, "He didn't like it." I thought he saw another version. "He didn't like that one either." I'm like, "Whoa." He's like, "We're gonna shoot another one in Chicago." I'm like, "Straight up? Word." "Kanye wants you to play Jesus." I'm like, "What?" "Yeah, Dave Chappelle didn't want to be Jesus." So I'm like, "Straight up. Why don't you get J. Ivy to do it?" He was like, "No. He don't want a Black Jesus." "He want a mixed Jesus so he don't got to argue about whether Jesus was Black or white." I'm the only mixed kid, so, hey, I got cast as Jesus. Bada boom, Bada bing. Acting debut. [chuckles] Watch out, Denzel. - [man 1] So just follow them?

Let's do a quick run-through. Go ahead. Dave, let's just do the move. You gonna focus pull all the way to Coodie over there? - [Coodie] Jesus knows all. - Let's just do a test. Go.

We used to call him you, man. - [Kanye] Yeah? - Word. Yeah. [Kanye] I see a lot of him in me. [Jamie] For real. [Puff Daddy] A lot of me in him. Vice-versa. [Jamie] That's some real shit, man. [Puff Daddy] It's been incredible to see him work. You know? The way he works… I call him "Boy Genius." "Little Quincy Jones." You know what I'm saying? You guys see? We got similar tastes. [woman] What would be the most meaningful thing to happen Grammy night for you? I always wanted the opportunity to speak. Even if I lost. Just give me a chance to speak. That's all I want. I just want to talk. I wanna go up and thank people. 'Cause I'm working on my speech and, you know… If I'm not able to say it at the press room, I'll have to say it in every interview all the way completely through. [woman] You both have a tendency to do a lot of talking, but you guys deliver. So it's okay. - You know... - [Kanye] Don't you love it, though? Right? What happened to the Muhammad Alis? What happened to the rock stars in the game? What's up with all this, "Thank you"? What are you supposed to do? Just bow? [softly] "Thank you very much." That's… Dawg! I'm saying I came from nothing. And right now, I'm sitting next to Puff on MTV. And I'm finna go home and call somebody, like, "Dawg, do you know what I just did?" It's to the point where I can't even get credit for nothing. I've been always trying… I spent 400 bucks on this just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this." You ain't up on this! I'm in the studio with Puff!

[Kanye] No. What happened is I actually told other people and they didn't believe it. [woman] We gonna lift you up with the help of this year's most nominated artist, Kanye West… [reporter 2] I'm interested in how you, and why you, believe all of this has happened. [Kanye] I just think it was in God's plan. I think He just has me here for a reason. That I have something to say. And there's people that might be better programmers, better rappers, but where I think I really won is I had the heart. [emotional music playing] [Coodie] Heart was the first thing I ever noticed about Kanye. I always believed his purpose would take him to these heights. Motivated by faith, we climbed together. And on this night, Kanye arrived at the top of the mountain. And the Grammy goes to… The College Dropout, Kanye West. [cheers and applause] [music continues playing] [imperceptible] Whoo! [cheers and applause] When I had my accident… I found out at that moment, nothing in life is promised except death. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life, you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed. Right now is my time and my moment. Thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to God, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest, everyone that's helped me. And I plan… I plan to celebrate. I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get, 'cause I'm at the Grammys, baby! [loud cheers and applause] [imperceptible] I know, I know. Everybody asked me the question. They want to know, "Well, Kanye…" "I know he's going to wile out and do something crazy." Everybody wants to know what I would do if I didn't win. [laughter] I guess we'll never know. [cheers and applause] [Coodie] When I started filming Kanye West, the goal was to see how far his dreams would take him. Now that he dominated the Grammys, I thought we had the ending to the documentary. But I had no idea where life would take us next.
