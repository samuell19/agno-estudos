To understand censorship in the Spanish film industry, we have to take into account that until 1973 it was completely arbritrary. There where no written rules. It was the result of what the pertinent commission of civil servants thought. But the political evolution of the country, the transition from autarchy and Falangism to the neo-capitalism of the Opus Dei in the early sixties a series of changes were brought about. These changes rationalized Spanish life in the economic, commercial and industrial aspects. Within this new politics of Opus Dei one of the areas affected was that of the film industry. The application of the set codes depends on how they are applied in order for them to be more or less severe. I will read some of the rules and will comment on them. For example, rule 14 of this censorship code forbids the disparaging or undignified presentation of political ideologies when in our country many anti-soviet, anti-revolutionary and anti-socialist movies have been exhibited. Of course, this rule has been interpreted to favor the reactionary and fascist film industry. Rule 15 states that films that promote hatred between races and social classes will be forbidden. It's ridiculous. Rule 16 states that films whose theme neglects the duty of defending the homeland will be forbidden. A very militaristic approach. Rule 17 states that anything against the Catholic Church, its dogma, its morals, its rites, or against the basic principles of the State, national identity, interior or exterior security, and against the Chief of State will be forbidden. These rules clearly protect the country's establishment. In some cases, there will be grotesquely ambiguous rules. For example, there is a very funny one, rule 18, which states: when the accumulations of scenes which in themselves present no fault yet collectively present a lustful, brutal, crude or morbid atmosphere, the film will be forbidden. In other words, scenes or shots which in themselves are harmless can also lead to the prohibition of a film. Again, the biggest paradox lies in rule 34, which is the key rule. All these rules will be applied equally to all films submitted to censorship regardless of nationality. The code prohibits justification of suicide, murder out of compassion, revenge and duels, divorce, adultery, illicit sexual relationships, prostitution, abortion and birth control. There is a long list. And finally, rule 12 forbids the images or scenes of cruelty to people or animals, or of terror. This is hypocritical because the police in this country uses terrorist methods on the streets, brutality against civilians, workers, students, yet this hypocrisy forbids showing on a screen the brutality and terror which it itself practices. Finally, there is a general rule under which everything falls. Blasphemous, pornographic and subversive films will be forbidden for any audience In other words, pornography, subversion and blasphemy are measured with the same ruler. It does, however, reveal the political philosophy of the regime as a whole. Censorship is applied at two levels. There is an initial application to the script. Any Spanish film has to go through a script censorship first which will cut, modify or simply, the script will be forbidden. Secondly, once the film is made based on the approved script, it will have to go through a second censorship. These two filters applying these codes make it practically impossible to have freedom of expression. Among the worst effects of this censorship code in my mind is the inhibition, the brutal self-censorship which it leads to and which is translated into the self-castration of its producers and script-writers, in other words, they won't write a scene for fear of its being cut. Their imagination is compressed and the result leads to a weakening of the scripts themselves. The conclusion is clear in that: the only kind of cinema of some interest and related somewhat to reality and in which there is a minimum amount of self-expression by the creators, falls outside the realms of legality. It is marginal cinema, a cinema which has become clandestine due to its legal status. From this standpoint, there are clearly two possibilities, two alternatives which are more or less practiced. The last word will be in the hands of those in filmmaking. On the one hand, there is a militant cinema, cinema which for whatever reason has not been able to be seen, and then on the other hand, a cinema which due to circumstances, has faced the impossibility of legal viability. In a way it forces marginal, clandestine cinema to disentangle itself from the sinister tradition of self-censorship which has always fallen heavily on the Spanish film industry. Yet, on the other hand, it offers the film maker the possibility of researching, or looking for ways which will be more meaningful with his media. And above all, it will help him get involved and to communicate through this new distribution channel in which he works. This type of film making, whose dissemination won't be easy, at least among us, is a type of film that could reach a ready and qualified audience. Not a massive or indiscriminate audience as we see in our movie theaters today. I think one can talk about underground cinema as a cultural option within a system, a cultural option as a reply to that system without trying to break it but work alongside it. However, in the experience of what has been called underground cinema in Madrid and Barcelona, the intention has been to integrate oneself into the profession but through parallel channels. As for the ideological meaning of these films, I think we can refer to them as types of psychodramas or almost subconscious presentations of the frustrations or conditioning of their creators. By no means are they considered as works of art in the sense that they portray a view of a life far from the creators' own frustrations or of their own egos, or are they films with political or even militant implications. On this last point of political and militant cinema we should probably point out that there is, in all cultural works, a political and ideological implication, which is to say, seeing the ideological/political significant in any work of art. But, at the same time, we find that there exists a militant cinema and literature in the sense that the objective has a political end. We are no longer living the times when a team of the Opus Dei within the government tries and opening-up process towards the exterior, the exterior being understood as a supposed liberalization of the regime. This proves to be a failure due to the fact that the government is incapable of controlling this supposed liberalization and the repercussions resulting from this liberalization which deeply attacks its politics. It is then obliged to take a hard line again. This hard line goes back to that taken after the Civil War both at political and cultural levels. And film making is submitted to the same conditioning and the impossibility of creating a new Spanish film industry to replace the earlier one. FRAGMENT OF INFINITE FRONT 1956, PEDRO LAZAGA. - The Father is inside. - Bad timing for your arrival, Captain. - Where's Father? - He's around here somewhere. Father Herrera, come on! - Father. - I can't! I can't! I have tried but... Sometimes I wonder if God refuses to hear me beseeching him. It's awful! Do you realize what you are saying? No, I don't. Get up. Get up, Father. Once I told you that your mission would be difficult. You wear a uniform and a star. This isn't a post of comfort but one of sacrifice. You can't evade fulfilling your mission as a priest however hard and unpleasant it is. As a priest and as an officer, your post is here. Here, with no weaknesses of spirit or of self-confessions. Fight and overcome it and pray. Remember the excuse Peter gave the Lord. "Lord, I have tried fishing all night but haven't been successful." God reprimanded him and the apostle bowed his head. "Trusting your word I will throw my nets." Remember it Father, remember it. And a miracle took place. And if you do it this way, Father, God will smile upon you but he will let it be you who makes the effort. And this effort will have its reward. This is your war, Father. Stand at attention on the count of one. Two. And three. At ease! Attention! Headquarters. Yes. Captain. Staff. Yes, yes, okay. Thank you. We have visitors. - Enemy planes are approaching. - Tell the Father. Tell the Father to hurry up. It's impossible to do that now. He is doing the consecration. Scatter yourselves, hurry! This isn't anything major. Paco! Hello, hello, how are you? How are you all? - Hey, hey, how am I? - How are you? If I tell you how you are, you won't get mad at me? - I won't get mad. - Are you sure? Then I will tell you. My friend Tony, you are very rude. - What did you say? - You are very rude. Okay, then show me why I am rude. Okay, an explanation of why you are rude. Very simple. The first thing you should do when you stand before an audience is to take off your hat, greet the public, say good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, whatever you prefer. You have this horrible habit of not taking off your little hat. - Hey, hey, give me my little hat. - Nope, I won't. - Give me the little hat. - I won't give it to you. - My head will get cold. - Doesn't matter. Look, I'm getting a bee in my bonnet and it's going to get ugly. Doesn't matter. Look, I am not going to give it to you. Let it be a lesson. I don't want to give it to you. Come here and kindly don't play with my wardrobe. - Give me my hat. - Give me mine first. No, Sir. You give me mine first. - Today he doesn't trust me. - So you don't want to give it to me. Won't you give me my hat first? You won't give it to me? - You first. - Oh yeah? Well, let's see. If I make a comparison and I convince you, you will give me my hat. Yes or no? Well, if you can convince me maybe I'll give it to you. Good, I am going to make a comparison. Let's suppose that there is a large hat shop right in front of here. You are in front of this hat shop. You go inside... - and they show you a new... - New. - elegant... - Elegant. - fabulous... - Tuberculous. No, no. Fabulous. With feathers, a really lovely hat. - An ugly hat? - No, really lovely. And then they show you a really horrible one. An old, green, bare... Bare like its owner. - Worth nothing. - It cost me five... Look, if someone were going to give you one of them, which one would you choose? The new one or the old one? Well... the new one! You would choose the new one. Well, that's it then. Take mine because it's the new one. - That's not a bad comparison. - Naturally. - What did you say? - Naturally, I convinced you. - Yes. Naturally? - Of course. Well look, neither naturally or factually. You won't give it to me? But let's see, didn't I convince you? - Yes. - Then give me my hat right now. Now it's my turn to make a comparison. That's a good one. You are going to give me a comparison. Go ahead. - Let's suppose tomorrow you go out. - I go out. And one of those athletic types passes in front of your house. An athlete, a young man. And from the other direction comes a little old man about 90 or 95 years old. Okay, an old man. Comes from the opposite direction. They reach the middle and trip and both fall. Both fall on the ground. Who would you help get up first, the old or the young man? What kind of a question is that? Of course, I would help the old man get up first. Just like my hat, which is 90 years old. Well, that it just great! You have really convinced me. Here's your hat. But hey, now you pick up mine. - Yours? - Yep. Well, since it's young it can get up by itself. Well, that is just great. I didn't like that at all. So you think you are really smart, huh? Of course. So so smart. Much smarter than you. - Very good. - Did you like it? Let's play another. Very good. I have decided to make a slight change in this pattern, as just to say… As an actor I am now going to do something which isn’t in the script, which hasn’t been rehearsed and which the director has not prepared. I am going to do something, so to speak, for myself. I am going to sing. I am going to sing because I love singing and I love music and because I was a singer for a time. But I have neverdone it on the screen; I’ve never done it in a film. I am also going to read something from a poem. I’m going to read from a poem by Edgar Allan Poe called The Raven. A beautiful poem. Damn! Excuse me. Let's start all over. Sorry. I'll start over because I missed something. Silence. Cut! Give it to me. The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe, is I suppose, completely unique in the English language. It has a unique rhythm and it has also a unique atmosphere surrounding it. I suppose, in a way, the central figure who tells the story is a little bit like Edgar Allan Poe himself. He was a sad, bitter, lonely, unhappy man and in this poem, of course, we have just such a person. It starts with the man in his house, sitting, dreaming in front of the fire and he hears this noise and he goes to the window (this is making it very brief), and he opens the window and in steps this bird. And the bird perches on this bust which is in the man’s room and the man, at first, quite quite calmly, almost in an amused sense starts to talk to the bird. Well it soon becomes quite obvious that the raven can only say one word and this one word gradually produces ever increasing sense of hysteria in the man himself because it doesn’t matter what questions he asks, and they are very important questions to him, about his lost love, about his life, about his future; the answer is always the same. It must be the only poem in I suppose any language, certainly any language that I am acquainted with, or any poem that I know of, where the entire work devolves from one phrase, indeed, one word. Cut. How much film do we have left? Let's do another take. Yes, you told me that when I finish my narration, we could cut the take. - Yes, when you were finished. - Yes, but we are still filming. Cut, cut, cut! Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. " 'This some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door; Only this, and nothing more." Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door. Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door, Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore. Tell me what the lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore." Quoth the raven "Nevermore." "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting— "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!— quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!" Quoth the raven "Nevermore." And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted— nevermore! Ok, are you ready? What do I have to say, "never more"? Yes, the last phrase. nevermore!
