ROMY'S SALON I used to think I knew everything. And that my gran was stupid. In truth, I didn't know anything. - How many days? - Five days. Plus the odd nightshift. That's great. Congratulations. - I'll need a childminder. - I'm sure you do. Could you help me out? - Me? - No. - Could Romy come here after school? - I don't know. I do not have the time. I'm on my own, you know. - She could go upstairs. - Upstairs? Bringing her friends and making a mess? I don't think so. I need the extra hours, Mum. I need your help. Stine Rasmussen. That's my gran's name. It is Danish. Just like my gran. - Hey, Romy. Say hi to Stine for me. - Okay. This is our story. The story of me and my gran. Here already? For God's sake, take off those shoes. And take yourself upstairs. Scoot. - I am really happy with it. - Great. Let me just give it a little spray. Very gently. Close the door for the cat. You look cute. Hey, Jens. Do you have to stay upstairs too? Romy? Okay, times five makes twenty. So, let's see. This should be... I don't understand. Okay, add this, and this and this. That should make two hundred. - Three hundred. - Please be quiet. No, look. That two needs to be a three. Three hundred. Sure. I know that. I know how to count. I've been doing this for donkey's years. No. You haven't finished. - Hey, Mum. - Hi. - Hey, darling. - I have food for you. - Never mind, Mum. - Why? I... I already ate a sandwich. And I need to get Romy to bed. Come on. - Bye, Granny. - Bye. - Bye, Granny. - Granny. See you tomorrow. How was your day? I don't want to go to Gran. - Can't I stay with Dad? - He doesn't have a house. I can look after myself. - You're only ten. - Right. Ten. Ten year old girls can't stay home alone. I can. I'm not having this conversation again. You're going to your gran's tomorrow. All right? Shoot, Romy. Over here. - Yes. Well done. - Tess? Are you coming? Did you have a nice day? - See you tomorrow. - Yeah, see you. Still here? Off you go, to your Gran. Tomorrow's another day. Bye, Miss Pauline. Hi. - Enjoy. - Thanks! Sweetie, please. John doesn't want you here. A Sprite, please. You know what we agreed. After school, you go to your... Gran. Can you get it for me? This one's on me. Margot? See you tonight. What are you doing? Service. One euro, please. - So this holds everything. - Everything you make in a day. Really? That's handy. I'll leave the instructions for you to read at your leisure. - Okay. I see. - Have a nice day. Bye. No. Do not touch. - Was the other one broken? - No, just old. This one should last me the next 20 years. - Do you plan to keep working that long? - Sure. Why not? Because you're already quite old? I'm only 69, you know. Off with you. Sweetie, you must stop coming to visit me at work. John doesn't like it. What's that? Nothing. Where did you get this? Romy? I earned it washing windows. This much? Daddy gave it to me. Pocket money. - Romy. Has he still not come? - No. - Why don't you come and wait inside? - I'm all right. Hey, princess. Hi, sweetie. - In front? - Sure. - What if the police come? - I'll just speed off. - The dessert menus. Here you go. - Thank you. Dad? Can I really not stay with you after school? What? With me? Not every day. Just once or twice a week. Sure. Great. But Sandra would be there too. Sweetheart, it is her house. Here. I don't need it. Take it anyway. Say hello to your mum? Bye. - Well? Did you have fun? - No. That's how it started. Every day, I had to be in that salon full of old people. But old people can surprise you, as I soon discovered. Hey, girlie. Do you have a cigarette for me? Maybe we should have another look at it together, Stine. Your accounts don't tally. - Do you have a cigarette? - No, Marie. No smoking in here. Just the one. How about a cup of coffee? Let's sit down. - Just the one. - Come with me. Mrs. Van Donkhorst, not here again? - Do you have a cigarette for me? - No, sorry. - Bye, Marie. - Come. Bye. Come, dear. Let's go find you a cigarette. Jens? Jens? Hey, Jens. All snuggled up in Granny's chair? My dearest Stine... I'm writing this letter in Dutch, because you have to practise. I hope I'll be able to come to Denmark again soon. I can't wait to see you again, with your lovely cheeks. Will you send me a fresh picture? Lots of love, Henk. I want that one. - Which one's yours? - This one. - Ten past four already? - Can I come? - It's not allowed. - Pity. Let's see. Cut and style. That makes 16 euros. Right. Let me see... This should... I need your help. I don't know how to work that thing. Sorry, my dog's been home alone all day. Of course. I understand. I'll get it from here. So, 16 euros. That means... Let's see. You gave me twenty. 16 euros. That means you're getting... Right. That's it. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. And that makes twenty. - Thank you. - Here you go. No, silly me. - See you next week. - Bye. Say hi to Frits. Well, how clever. Thank you so much. Good job. Right. And then... I still don't know. - Go back. I was watching that. - But it scares me. You should have been in bed already. And Van Putten will be here shortly. - Mr. van Putten? - Yes. To help me with my accounts. - What are you looking at? - Maybe he's in love. What? With me? Don't be silly. You need to get to bed now. It is really late. No, give that to me. Thank you. I'll come and look in on you in a bit. Did you brush your teeth? Yes? Let's see. Well done. Where is that? That's Sundby beach. In Denmark. Our cottage was close to the sea. Strandlřkken 17. I got lost there once. When I was little. - Do you know who took me home? - No. The same man who painted this picture. Your granddad. Grandpa Henk. Such a lovely man. - But he was from Holland. - Yes. But he always spent the summer in Denmark. And lucky for me, very near to where I was. Who can that be? - Weren't you expecting Van Putten? - Van Putten? I don't feel like seeing him. I'm not answering the door. But wasn't he meant to help you with your accounts? Right. My accounts. I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on tight. Anyway. You get some sleep. And don't forget to switch off your light. - Good night. - Night. Of course I'm sure. You just don't know how to count. Don't look at me like that. Do you think I'm crazy? That's not what I'm saying. But when I add up all of your earnings, there should be enough money. - Well, good. - Not so good. Because the money's not there. You're in the red. - That's strange. - Yes. Quite. Granny? Granny? Granny? Granny? Dino, not so fast. - Romy, what is it? - Granny is gone. - What's that? - Granny is gone. I can't hear you. Be quiet, Dino. - Granny is gone. - I'm sure she'll be back. Why don't you go back to bed? Absolutely marvellous. What a lovely ride. It's really... Stine? Romy. What are you doing up? Get yourself upstairs. What were you doing out of bed? - Well? - I needed the toilet. - Why did you not go back to bed? - You were gone. - But I always come back. You know that. - No. I don't. Well... Come on now. I was really worried. Van Putten wanted to take me for a spin. And crazy as it sounds, I... You forgot all about me. Yes. - It doesn't matter. - Actually, it does. I don't know what's wrong with me lately. One moment my head is very full. And then suddenly it is completely empty. I'm sorry. Don't tell your mum. She's bound to worry. But we'll be all right, won't we? You and me. Yes. Sleep tight now. I don't know why, but from then on, everything was different. Maybe because Gran wasn't just looking after me, I was looking after her. And that made me feel very different. - Want to join in? - I'm going to my gran. What would I do without you? And we have arrived at our destination. - Well, thank you, sir. - The pleasure was mine, ma'am. No, the pleasure was mine. Do you know who's really good at funny voices? Sandra. - She's really nice. - Say you. Mummy's nicer. - Sweetie, bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. - Well? How was it? - All right. What did you do? - I'm going to my room. - Okay. Now Van Putten is saying something's not right again. There's too little money in the bank. Money's disappearing. You haven't, by any chance... borrowed some? No. I have plenty of money. Sorry, that was a stupid question. Of course you didn't take any money. Van Putten must be mistaken. I'm sure I took everything to the bank. Maybe you tucked some away? Maybe in a place you forgot? But where? Come see. I've been looking for this for ages. This is our cottage. Where I was born. Strandlřkken 17. This is me. - And this is my grandmother. - My great great grandmother. I always enjoyed swimming here so much. Such a lovely feeling. - The water caressing your bare skin. - What? - All of us kids swam in the nude. - Yuck. - What's yucky about that? - Everything. - Nonsense. - Shouldn't we carry on looking? No, come sit with me. This is so nice. Look, that's Henk. With his dog. Granny. Well, I'll be... That's right. You're so clever. - Two thousand five hundred euros? - Tucked into the sofa. That much? - What are you doing here? - I've taken a day off. I closed the salon. - What if people want a haircut? - Tough luck on them. Come on. Bye, Tess. What is the thing you'd like to have most in the world? Anything. - I wouldn't be allowed. - Sure you would. You like? Granny, where are you going? I've always wanted to spend a night here. Is this allowed? - Whose permission would we need? - Mummy's. She's at work. She doesn't have a say. Good afternoon. Here you go. - I thought you'd go naked. - No way. Not in a pool. These bubbles are so... What's that? Is that Danish? - Did Granddad know Danish? - Henk? No. Not really. Holiday Danish. Maybe a little bit more. But no, not really. I almost immediately started learning Dutch. We were so very much in love. I simply had to come to Holland. Were you never homesick? We really should go there together. I overslept. We're in the middle of a spelling test. Here, sit down. Tess, look what Granny gave me. Nice. She gave it to you? Must have cost a fortune. Gran said I could choose. - What did Gran say? - This. - Did you give this to her? - Me? Yes, yesterday. We bought it together. What's the fuss? I had a stroke of luck. She's ten. I don't even have an expensive phone like that. Do want one? I'll buy you one. - That's not the point. - Right. That's not the point. - What are you looking for? - You know. Two of those... thingies. You know... Those thingies. - Are you even in your right mind? - Why? - You're acting strangely. - Strangely? How? Throwing money around, sleeping in a hotel. - I was treating my grandchild. - I get that. But you were never like that. She deserves a treat. A breakaway from that dreadful divorce of yours. Sweetie, that's not it. I need those things. You know, for this. Those things. Potholder. Yes. So clever of you. Thank you. - Cool. - Granny gave it to me. Mummy says we have to take it back. Iit is a bit much for a little girl like you. - Your gran's crazy. - You are crazy. Granny is lovely. Right, lovely... She says I'm a great help. - Your gran is... - Shush, it's starting. Romy? Come here, sweetheart. I have something for you. What I have here in my hand used to belong to me and grandpa Henk. And to no one else. But now I'm giving it to you. It's the key to the shop. When I'm gone... I would love you to have the salon. Would you like that? We'll rename it 'Romy's Salon'. How does that sound? - Does Mum know about this? - No, and we won't tell her either. Come on, let's practise. I was very happy with that key. I hoped Granny and I would be working together for a long time. I didn't know then what I know now. I have an appointment at 3:30. - Please take a seat. - Thank you. Granny? Is something wrong, Granny? Should I call Mummy? I just need some rest. That's all. Mrs. Ten Berghe is here. - So you need to come down. - Okay. I'll see you there. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Granny? Granny? - Are you coming? - Yes. Yes, sure. I'll come. You'll have to get dressed first. - Please hurry. - Sure. Hey, Dad. Now? No, I can't. Because. I'm at Granny's. Bye. - Here you go. - Thank you. Stine's Salon. Romy speaking. Of course. I can book you in for tomorrow, 11 o'clock. Or Tuesday, if you prefer. Petra? Okay. I've booked you in. Thank you. Bye. Why are you here? I said I can't come. I wanted to see you. And I could do with a haircut. - Where's your gran? - She'll be right down. Look who we have here. Look who we have here. Henk, my darling. It's me. Willem. But you can call me Henk. I missed you so much. Look, Margot. Something's not right. - I know, but... - She needs to see a doctor. What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Romy, listen. Granny hasn't been well lately. - Granny's fine. - No, Romy. Just leave us. This is for grown-ups. - She's my granny. - Yes, she's your granny. Great. - I am going to show you three cards. - Okay. - This is an apple. - I can see that. A key. And a hammer. - Could you please show me the apple? - This one right here. Or this one. No, there it is, of course. - I'm not a child. - Mum. I realise how hard this must be for you. But we should do a brain scan. What do you think is wrong with me? I hope I'm not going senile. Senile? Like Marie, who always comes in to bum cigarettes. She's suffering. If that is what's wrong with me, let them put me down. What do you mean? Nothing. Never mind. What's the matter? My gran's in hospital. For tests. CLOSED due to family circumstances Well? What did the doctor say? There's nothing they can do. Right, Margot? There is no cure. So what is wrong? What's wrong with you, Granny? - What was it again? - Alzheimer's. - No. - Yes. You have Alzheimer's. You're going senile, Mum. Forever? - But why? - Because we can't carry on like this. - Like what? - Like this. The salon. Everything. It's fine. Romy's a big help. But, Mum? I have the key. So I could open up. Romy, no. Just because they say something's wrong... Mum. - There really is something wrong. - I can help Granny. Listen, Mum. You can stay in your house and Romy can still visit. But the salon must close. Hey, good to see you. My darling. - Are you open? - Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be? - Mum said you needed to close. - But that's complete nonsense. - Why so much shampoo? - Because we'd run out. - But this many? - Yes, this many. - Hi. Are you open? - Yes, of course we're open. Mrs. Rasmussen. Ineke Op 't Veld. From the home care agency. Home care? I don't know why you're here. I didn't ask you to come. We made an appointment. You can leave. Now. I have my granddaughter to help me. - Is that so? - Yes, that is so. Bye. No, Mum. You have to let the lady in. Yes, we did. We asked her to come. She can help you around the house. No, the salon stays closed. But you have to let the lady in. You do. Bye, Mum. Granny must accept she needs help. I help. Yes, you help. Granny, I'm here. Start at the end. That's right. Isn't it lovely, Jens? Well done. - Shall I make tea? - Yes, please. Good job. - You've done so many already. - Yeah. - What was I doing? - Making tea. That's right. What happened to the tea? Granny could no longer live alone. She was too confused. I wanted her to move in with us. I would have given her my room. But Mum said that wasn't an option. - Don't you think it's nice, Mum? - Very nice. Come. Yes, this is your home now, Mum. I have the exact same one. It is yours. That's where I want to live. In Sundby. That's not possible, Mum. So what do you think? Do we all have to sleep in that tiny bed together? Mum, it's not for us. This is your new home. No, forget it. This is so... Come on, let's go. Where's my coat? Hello. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. My name is George. - Hi. - Hello. Nice hair. - My mum used to be a hairdresser. - I am a hairdresser. I am a hairdresser. And you have nice hair. Lovely hair. Right, Mum. We're off. Come, Romy. Say goodbye to your gran. Bye. No, ma'am. You're staying with us. Why can't Jens live there? I don't know. Those are the rules. But Granny isn't nearly as bad as all the others there. Listen, Romy. I had to. I cannot watch your gran all day. - But I can. - No, you have to be in school. What's more important? Granny, or school? Granny? Jens? Hi, Gran. - Margot. - No, I'm Romy. - What are you doing? - I'm going home. That's upstairs, right? Bugger off. - Go away. Leave me alone. - She's rude. My goodness. Look. - This is where you live. - No, this is not where I live. Look. It's Mummy. - Margot. - I see. Does she live here? Hello. - I'm helping Granny feel at home. - I see. Brilliant. Who are you? I am George. I am here to take care of you. You're a handsome man, George. - I think you're pretty too, ma'am. - Thank you. - I'm here to take you to dinner. - Do they feed us here? Yes, every night. No. No, that's not true. It really isn't. Is it? Sad. Stine is not coming back. Look, I can't afford two houses. I don't have the money. I was glad someone wanted to buy it. We could have lived there. With Granny, and Jens. - No, Romy. - We could have, if we'd wanted to. But you didn't want to. Too much trouble. It's your fault that she's getting worse. Take that back. She couldn't even take Jens. That place is making her worse. That's the disease. It's terrible. - Listen, Romy. - Dad? Can we take Granny to Denmark some time? Sure. Maybe. If I can take the time off from work. Listen, Romy. If what's happening to Granny Stine ever happens to me, you'll have to find me a nice place to stay. But not in your home. Okay? Promise? Hi, Romy. I'm Sandra. - Do you want some food? - No, thanks. I thought it was time you two met. We were talking about Grandma Stine. Right, Romy? I want to go home. Granny? Granny? What are you doing? - Are you sad? - No. No, darling. Why would I be sad? There's nothing to be sad about. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I knew where Granny wanted to be. In the painting. She'd said so herself. Romy? Romy, I need to be off. Don't forget your lunch. Romy, I'll try to be back at four. Shall we have some tea then? I really have to go now. Bye. Bye. Sorry, Jens. You can't come. Hi. Hey, Romy. Shouldn't you be in school? - Teacher training day. - I see. Your gran's a lucky lady. - Right. Let's go. - What? Where are you going? For a walk. - In the garden. - Okay. Back before lunch, all right? Have fun. 'Have fun.' Slime bag. Maybe this one. There's no one in there. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. I want to go to Denmark. Denmark? - I'm going to Hamburg. - Hamburg is okay. Wait. He will take us. Tess, did Romy tell you what time her doctor's appointment was? No. Hamburg. Granny. She's not with you? Calm down. I'll be right there. Romy's missing. Welcome to voice mail. Romy, where are you? Please call me. Romy, this is Daddy. We are really worried. Romy, it's Mummy. Call me back. Look. Hotdogs. Maybe we can get something to eat there. Inge Svensen. See, it was much better for Granny to be in Denmark. I was glad we went. Really glad. Isn't it pretty? - Do you recognise it? - Strandlřkken 17. Strandlřkken 17. Granny knew exactly where to go. She'd been there so many times. We can get in through here. Granny, what are you doing? No, wait. Go on. - Is this allowed? - Sure. Give it a push. Granny. Come. Grandma? It's me. Stine is here. There's nobody here. Where are you? I want to go home. Granny? Go away. Go away. Leave me alone. I want to go home. - Romy? - Mummy? Romy, where are you? - I don't know what to do. - Where is she? - Is Granny with you? - Yes. But it's not going well. - Where are you? - In Denmark. In Denmark? - Denmark. - They're in Sundby. Listen, Romy. You stay where you are. Okay? Yes. But can you please come quickly? Of course. Daddy and I are on our way. - Is that Granny? - Yes. She's really not doing very well. Oh, dear. Can you put her on the phone? - Mum. Are you okay? - Yes. Don't worry, Mum. We're on our way. Margot. Mummy? Why don't you lie down? Sleep tight. Mummy will be there when you wake up. My mummy? My mummy. Margot. Lie down now. Make yourself comfortable. Granny. Granny. That was lovely. Just lovely. Are you all right, darling? Warm enough? I thought coming here would make Granny feel better. That was a great idea, darling. A super idea. So lovely. I want to go for a swim. No, Granny. Come. - We're not going for a swim. - Let's go grab a bite to eat. Come. I know that Granny will steadily get worse. That soon, she won't remember who we are. Or who she is. But at least I know now. I am glad that I do. And I will never forget it. Subtitling FAST TITLES MEDIA
