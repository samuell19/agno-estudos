It was one of the strongest applications we've seen in years, and your essay touched many people on the committee. Well, I just want to say thanks again, for the support and everything you've done for me. You've proven you deserve to be here, Rebecca, and you'll be a real asset to the Neuroscience Nursing program. And I want to assure you that there are people here who understand your situation. We're a very diverse group, and some of us have personal experiences much like yours, with unique and challenging family circumstances. I think we've covered everything for now. We're very excited to have you here. I'm excited, a little scared but very excited. I've never actually been on a plane before. It won't be a long flight. If everything's covered on your end, we'll see you here on the 17th. The 17th? That's like a week away. We've got a lot of ground to cover to get you all caught up. This is a very special circumstance and in order to make sure you won't fall behind we'll need you here as soon as possible. Right, right, yeah. The 17th. I'll be there. You know what to do. Hey, it's me. I was hoping you'd pick up. Look, I'm headed to work soon. And I was wondering if maybe we could meet up afterwards. I'll be done at 3:00 so I could come by yours after? I know you'll be up. Just check in, okay? I need to talk to you about something. I love you, bye. Hey, everything okay? Becca? Becca? - Hey. - Hey. Yeah, hey, everything's fine. So, how'd it go? What? I thought you had that call today? Oh, yeah, it went great. They want me there for the 17th. Shit, that's like next week. Yeah. That's a good thing, right? It's great, I mean, it's amazing. It's just... You still haven't told Richie. He's in a good place. You know, I don't want to jinx it. If he's in a good place, then it's the best time to tell him. He's your brother, he'll understand, okay? Your mailbox is full. To listen to your messages press... I know what you said the other day about not everything being an emergency. And I'm not trying to freak you out or anything like that because everything is under control. But something's going on and I don't want to get into it over the phone because you really need to be here to understand what's happening and I really think it'll blow your mind. Pick up, pick up, pick up! Pick up, pick up, Becca, come on. Don't make me beg, just come over as soon as you get this. Like I was saying, if I start getting into it, you're gonna think I'm crazy, and it's not about that. You really need to be here. I need your help. Please, Becca, I don't. You know what to do. You know what to do. What now? Richie left me some weird messages and now he's not picking up. Is it okay if I just run out and check on him, just get it over with and then I'll be back in 30 minutes, tops. Fine, but you gotta make it quick. It's gonna pick up in here once the game starts. I'll be right back. Hey, Becca? Promise me you'll tell him. Rebecca? Yeah. In 100 meters, turn right. Recalculating. It takes us straight to a detour, which just takes us to another detour. There's no logic. Turn right, nope, it's closed. Go back this way. Guess what, we're stuck in a loop. Recalculating. The music? I'm so sorry. It's been going on all night. If it's not that music, it's that vibration. It shakes the whole building. I know I said I wasn't gonna call the cops again, but some of us have to work, Okay? Some of us need a little peace and quiet. I totally get it. I don't think you do, Rebecca. Because if you did, this wouldn't keep happening, but it does keep happening. Well I'm gonna go deal with it right now. No need, I called the super, he's gonna come here tomorrow bright and early and he's gonna have a little chat with your brother. Why would you do that? Because I've had it, okay? It's either your brother or it's me. And I'm not leaving. Great. Excuse me, I'm not done speaking with. These people are such trash! Richie! Richie! What the hell? No! No, no, no! No. Hey, thanks for showing up finally. Hey, earth to... Richie! Becca! Cover yourself up! I was having the weirdest dream. No, I thought you were in the closet. In the closet. You are in the closet. Oh! Right. What the hell is going on, Richie? Come on! Okay, watch. This is my third attempt. I'm writing everything down in a journal, which is good, 'cause it's really fuzzy up here, but. It's it's a total mind-fuck. You know, seeing yourself dead. It's just, I mean, wow, I've seen hallucinations and shit but... This, this is I mean, like, this is real. Turn it off. Wait, hold on, there's more. So I keep waking up butt naked and at first I thought this was mold or something like that but I think it's something completely different. As far as I can tell, this is where it happens. Okay, this is where it gets weird. See! Did you see that? I can't get it on tape because it keeps messing up. But you were here, what did you see? What do you mean? I wasn't in the room. You couldn't have come over five minutes earlier! Wait, where were you? I've been calling you all day. I was at work. When I got your messages I tried calling you back but you didn't pick up. Yeah, I don't know what I did with my phone. You're here now, that's great. I need you to pay attention. Okay, just stay there, one second. Did you stop taking your pills? No. Yes, I like... that's beside the point. What's wrong? Do you not see what's going on? No, I do see what's going on, Richie, and I don't have time to get pulled into another one of your weird art projects. God dammit, I thought something happened! Something did happen! I want to be here and I want to help you but I have to go right now. I'm done at 3:00, I can come back here and we can figure this out together. Please, please, Becca. Now, I can see that things are really intense right now. Okay, all right, but I'll be back. But I need you to keep the music off and stop whatever this is until then, okay? Okay. Becca, I can't figure this out without you watching. Okay, please, I just, I need you to watch. Please, just stay. Don't, just look, okay, look! Look! Hey, everything okay? Yeah, it's worse that I thought. Is Richie all right? Yeah, he doesn't look so good. Ah, I don't think I can leave yet. I'll call you back later, okay? What the fuck is going on, Richie? It's all in here, which is good because things up here are a little bit jumbled. Okay, see? What the fuck is going on! Just relax, okay, relax. Relax? Relax! There are dead bodies all over the apartment, Richie. Your dead bodies! Just shut up, okay! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was very mean. I love you. Look, just listen. I called you because something bad did happen. I killed myself. But then something amazing happened. I don't understand. I've already died three times. And I have come back three times. But I don't know how. I thought the video would capture it but you saw what happened. So I need you to be the video. What do you mean? I need you in my room to just watch what happens next. Okay, and where will you be? I'll be dead. What? Wait! What do you mean? I'm gonna kill myself. And I need you to be in here to just watch what happens next. No. - Becca, please. - No, no way! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! Oh, no you don't. You came back. Richie, this has to stop, right now, okay. The music and whatever this is, has to stop. I'm not trying to scare you, okay. I get it, this is really weird. But take a look around. I'm not making this up. I'm not spiralling, this is happening. So let's just, you know, go with it. I'm not comfortable with this. It's already done. What's already done? I took something when you stepped out. So it's gonna be kicking in pretty soon. Jesus, Richie! It's fine, it's fine, really. Oh my God. No, no, no, I'm good. I'm good, really. I'm fine. We need to get you to a hospital, Richie. Uh uh. You've seen my bodies. Just trust me. I'll come back, I promise. When I'm gone, go in my bedroom. Write down what you see. It's like when I had heatstroke in Hampton Beach. Not really. You held my hand all night long. I remember. I remember when you puked on my prom date before we even had a chance to leave. 'Cause you drank an entire bottle of schnapps. Darryl something. Darryl Friedman. He had it comin'. I remember last year when I got a call from the cops at 3:00 in the morning saying they took you to the hospital. How I felt when I saw you in that room. I thought... Never mind. Richie, I have to tell you something. Oh! You dick! Richie? Richie? Oh my God... What the fuck are you doing in my apartment? Put some clothes on. I'm starving. Why do you look so freaked? What the hell is that? Right. How many fingers? Come on. Three. Touch your nose with your pointer finger. Now touch my finger. How do you feel? Annoyed. For real. I don't know, my brain hurts. Okay, hurts how? Like, sharp, throbbing? Like fuzzy, or something, just... Like I can kind of remember things and I also kind of don't. It's all just layered on top of itself. So my mind is getting really worn down. Like if you were making a copy of a tape that's already a copy of a tape, do you know what I mean? No, not really. Okay, okay. Remember the audio pieces that I made with Mom and Dad's voices when we were kids? So if you used the same tape, over and over and over again, back and forth, then the sound, it starts to get really weird and you can hear whatever you just recorded, but then everything else starts to fade in the background and it gets degraded, and it's layer on layer. So the new stuff that you record, it sounds great. And then the old stuff, not so much. Okay, so you're like a copy of a copy of a copy. Of a copy. What day is it? Tuesday. It's Saturday. Yeah, okay, it could be. I never know what day of the week it is. Okay, what year is it? 2019. Why are we doing this? Well, you might have brain damage. Oh fuck. Or, I don't know, you were just born so your mind is building new pathways. I mean, neurons and synapses are firing through your brain like a spray of bullets. Which actually might explain the delay. I mean, especially the short-term memory loss. Show me your scar. Oh my God. You're like, the same. All right, you know what, stop. I need to get something to eat. Like, exactly the same. So I can't die. I'm like, immortal. Becca, I think I'm good. Take them. All right, fine. Okay, good. Out of that. Yeah. Makes sense. Being born and all, that's why it looks like a vagina, right? It looks more like an asshole to me. Did you know that Salvador Dalí had a brother who died before he was born? Whose name was also Salvador Dalí. His parents were convinced that he was a reincarnation of his older brother. I mean, Salvador one died exactly nine months before Salvador two was born. He claimed he spent his entire life trying to step out of the shadow of the other Salvador, to purge him from his life so he could become his one, true self. Totally makes sense to me now. He also wore a lobster for a hat. Maybe he was just crazy for crazy's sake. Yeah, maybe. You know the saying, repeating the same patterns and expecting different results... You've done this a few times now, right? You keep coming back. Nothing changes. So what if you just stopped? Accept the results as they present themselves. You don't have to step out from behind anyone's shadow. Hm, I don't know, then what's the point? Maybe the point is that you're supposed to live. Maybe you keep coming back, because you're supposed to be here. I have really exhausted ways to kill myself. Well, all the clean ways. It's starting to get kind of ripe in here. Fuck, Matt called the super! Okay, so? So? He's gonna come in the morning. Great, he can fix the wall in my bedroom. - Richie? - Right, he can't fix that. 'Cause what if I accidentally kill myself, we don't want to seal that off. No, the bodies, Richie. If he shows up he's definitely not gonna see this the way that you see it. The way that you and I see it. And he's not gonna let us explain either. He'll call the cops and they'll take you away. Take us away. How are they gonna know you're not an accomplice? Will you stop making jokes? Can you at least look at me? Okay, sorry. So what do we do? There's only four, right? Let's see. There's electrocution in the bathtub. Hanging in the closet. Suffocation in the kitchen. OD'd on the couch. So that's four, which makes me lucky number five. So we need four barrels and some acid or something like that. Yeah, Richie, do you have four barrels and that much sulfuric acid? No, I don't. Do you? No, no, I don't. Do you have Dad's old toolbox? Yeah, I think so. I'm good. It's the only way. I've never hacked up a body before, let alone my own body. Don't you do this kind of thing all the time? No! Okay, I've heard you talk about dissecting bodies. Okay, I have done it, but I don't do it all the time. It's not like a hobby. Tomato, tomahto. This is gonna get messy. Do you have any garbage bags? Is it flipped? Yeah. Don't let it distract you, push it. Push it! Jesus Christ, Richie, turn it off! Sorry! 35, you look so young. It's off, right? Yeah, it's off. Do you think it will still work? Don't creep up on me ever again. - Okay? - Okay, sorry. But do you think it will still work, the toaster? Oh, oh. Don't you dare throw up. I won't, I won't, I'm good, I'm good. I'm good. I can do this. I can do this. I can, I can do this. It's pretty fucked up, huh? Please don't. You have something, never mind. - Do you have any more bags? - Yes. Shit, Becca, I knocked over your purse. Just leave it. We'll deal with it later. What's taking so long? What the hell is this? My acceptance letter. Obviously, for what? School. Obviously! I wanted to tell you about it. That's why I called earlier and said that I wanted to talk. Yeah, well I must have fried my phone when I electrocuted myself. You got this last month. When were you gonna tell me? Today. I was waiting for the right time, but it wasn't the right time. When did you apply? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? Obviously this matters, Becca, why would you not tell me this? 'Cause I'm not going. Okay, I'm not gonna go! - And why not? - Why not? Why do you think? You think I can move across the country when stuff like this is always happening? Really, stuff like this? Yeah, well, I mean not exactly like this, but there's always something! There's always some kind of crisis with you that I need to... What, say it. That I need to save you from. I'm not a child. Who looked after you when mom died, because it sure as hell wasn't dad. You were supposed to look after me, you were my older brother. I did, when he was out drinkin' himself fucking stupid, I was there watching over you! Do you remember that! That was me! Yeah, well a lot's changed since then. What's that supposed to mean? Forget it, it doesn't matter. I didn't ask to be like this. I didn't ask for the mood swings. I didn't ask for the paralyzing depression. I didn't ask for the anger. I didn't ask for the constant thoughts of killing myself. And you come in here and you're lying to me. And you look at me like I'm insane. People have been looking at me like that for my entire life. I didn't think you would. You were the one person who did not look at me like I was a fucking freak. It's okay, it's okay, I'm sorry. It's been a really long night. I want to talk about this and we will. But we have other things to deal with first, okay. Now why don't you take a little break. And I'll deal with this right now. Okay. What? Where's the other body? What! Where's the other body? Don't get up. Oh, shit. Yes, who is it? Hey, it's Becca. Are you fucking serious? Yeah, I got locked out. I'm really sorry. I tried buzzing Richie but he has his headphones on because we were trying to keep the noise down and everything. And I forgot the cinder block... Enough! Thank you. Sorry. If it's not one of you makin' a bunch of noise, it's the other. You know, every single squeak you make back here echoes through the entire building. Look, Matt, I know we've been a total pain in your ass tonight. There's just a lot going on. And I know it's no excuse, I understand. I can only imagine what it must be like to be his neighbour. - Hold up. - No. No, no, no, it's, I... Oh Jesus, whose body you got in here? Just so you know, I don't like having to be the bad guy all the time. Yeah, I know the feeling. I'm sure you do. Yeah, well sometimes it can be a little overwhelming but I guess that's what family's all about, right? You can't live with 'em, you can't chop 'em up and throw 'em out with the trash. Listen, it's not my place but at some point you're gonna have to let him clean up his own mess. I'm sure you have better things to do. Yeah, you'd be surprised. For a while I thought that things would be different. But, he needs me, so here I am. Why isn't he here helping you out for a change? Well, I don't know if you know, but Richie has some mental health issues. You don't say. Okay, well, just bend at your knee and lift with your legs, not with your back. Come on. Ah, thank you. Anytime. That was the last time. Hey, thanks. Anytime , no. Good night. Keep it quiet, okay? Hey, listen... Please, just, can you give me five minutes? I just, I need a break. Sure. Jesus Christ, Richie, the music! Finally, you're awake. All I wanted was five minutes. That was more than five minutes. So I fell asleep, so what. Mm, maybe we should order pizza or something. Why are you acting so weird? Becca... Shit, what did I say about the goddam music! Becca, wait. What the fuck is that? I was tryin' somethin' out. Oh, God. Becca! I have had it with you! I've been more than patient. You sucker me in with your sad girl song and dance. Like a chump I fall for it. Well no more, okay! I'm callin' the cops. He's gonna call the cops. - Don't open it! - I have to! Hey, Matt, how's it going? Bad, Dick, what do you think? It's the middle of the night and I'm still awake. Yeah, I'm sorry about the music, I'm just clearing my head. Oh, yeah, well you can't do this to people, okay? I have rights. We're so sorry. I told him to keep it down. Oh, well that solves it then because this one gives two shits what you tell him, huh? Okay, you know, the music's off, it won't be going on again, it's all right. So, just go back to your apartment. What do you think you're doing? Don't you dare close the door on me. Hey, get out of here! Okay. Ow. Smells like death in here. I don't know what I expected from the likes of you two. There's paint everywhere, this place is a pigsty. What the hell is that? It's not what it looks like. You made this? Holy shit! Holy fuckin'...you stay the fuck away from me. Holy fuckin' shit! Hey, you get away from me. Jesus Christ, you are fuckin' psychopaths. I knew it, I knew it. Oh, oh my God. Matt, no, please. - You shut your mouth. - Please, we can explain. Explain it to the cops, missy, okay. Step away from me. Stay the fuck away from me. Please, please don't. You son of a bitch! If you'd just stop and listen for a minute. I just got this phone. You know how much this cost? - More than your life. - Don't! Oh, I dare you! Why would you do that? He was gonna call the cops. With what? Dammit, Richie, you keep making everything harder. Why couldn't you just listen to me for once? I don't think that's very fair. And what were you doing with that arm? Well, I found it in the bathroom so I just started painting with it. I mean, come on, how fuckin' avant-garde is that, right? You left evidence in the living room. What evidence? I am alive. No one's gonna think that's your arm. It's an exact copy. We've been through this. Your arm is attached to your body, Richie. That one, it's not, remember? Yeah, okay, okay, right. Duh, wait. Why don't we just kill him? We're not killing anyone. - Just listen to me. - No. - If we kill him... - Richie. We are not killing him. Hear me out, all right, just give me a second. Lift him up. Lift him up, come on. You do realize this is kidnapping, right? It doesn't matter. None of it matters. It's gonna be like a dream, right? If we kill him. No. He'll die here, then another him's gonna come out of there and it'll be like it never happened. How do you know that? Just trust me, it all makes sense. No, it doesn't make sense. None of it makes sense. You keep coming back but how do you know that... Everyone comes back, Becca! Listen, I didn't want you to get caught up in this, okay. But I needed someone and you are the only one I trust. Oh, boohoo. I need you, you're the only one I trust. Give me a fuckin' break. Hey, Dick, she's always helping you. I see her here all the time, she's cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, getting you groceries. Maybe if you stopped staring at yourself all damn day, you'd see how much she does for you. Well. You're no better, missy. Oh, I'm too scared to tell him how I really feel. Can't live my own life, so I guess I'll just die up here on my cross. You both suck. Well, fuck you, Matt. Yeah, fuck you, Matt. Fuck me? You don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you just put a sock in his mouth or something. Is that true? No, I mean. I don't want you to be afraid to talk to me. Richie, I'm not, it's just. I'm not, I want to be able to talk to you. I want to be able to tell you things. Yeah, you should, I mean, we're siblings, we should be able to talk about anything. I can trust you, I know, it's just, it's hard, you know. You're goin' to fuckin' jail, idiots. Will you shut up. I don't know who taught you to tie a knot, but you can add that to the list of things you suck at. See, we should have just killed him. We're not killing anybody. You're not killing me. 'Cause you're already dead. Matt, Matt! What are you doing? What does it look like? Matt! Call 911. Why would I do that? Just let him die. Now! See, it's happening. You're wasting your time, he's dead. See! I told you. Stop. He's dead, you're wasting your time. No. We'll switch his clothes. He won't notice the difference and it'll be like it never happened. I can't. Sure you can, it's easy. It does not matter. No, it does matter, Richie! These things, they matter. You keep acting like nothing's happened. But I can't. I carry all of this shit all the time. You don't. You don't care. I thought you were dead, back in that hospital. You remember that? You were dead. And then you weren't. And I thought, why couldn't he have just died? Everything would have been so much easier. Becca, don't think you need... Oh, oh, okay. Don't move, don't move, shh, shh. - What happened? - There's been accident. - It's okay. - It's gone. What did you do to me? Come on, hey, hey, everything's okay. Becca. You're okay. Becca! Shh, what? Hey, you're okay. Just, just stay there. It's gone, where'd it go? I don't know. He's alive, so maybe it just disappeared. Okay, get your stuff, we're going to the hospital and I'm not leaving you alone in here. No, we can't go to the hospital, Becca, because we cannot go... What the hell is, holy fuck! Don't leave me! You assholes! Oh shit. He killed that thing. Huh? If he got out, we are in so much trouble. That's impossible, you can't... Dude, that was badass, man, you crushed that thing's head in! All right, listen, I know this is gonna be a little overwhelming, but we can explain everything. Richie? Hey guys. Holy shit! Don't touch me! - Don't touch me! - Richie! I'm sorry about the music! Help, Becca! Becca, help me, Becca! Becca! Fuck! Go, go, go! It's fine, it's fine. He'll come back and we'll just explain everything to him so that we avoid, you know, all of this. What happened? He came through, but the old him was still alive, so I think something must have gotten corrupted. They're both dead now, so. Maybe we should clear him out, you know, before he comes back. Might be a bit of a shocker. All right, grab his legs. - What's happening? - I don't know. Why isn't it coming out? I don't know. This has never happened before. Obviously, I'm still here. Is there anything in there about me? Why would there be something... Stop, I found it, in the closet. I was trying to tell you, it's just... What did you do? I didn't do anything, Becca. But you just need to listen. Becca, okay, I just, you, it was this. I made it for me, this is what I drank earlier. Did I come out of that fucking wall? At first I thought that you were asleep. And then it started happening. So I took your clothes and I put you in the closet. I just, I panicked. You stuffed my body into a closet and you didn't even tell me, Richie. So what, okay, this is you, this is still you. What's the big deal? What's the big deal? We spent the night cutting up my bodies and dumping them in the garbage. All of those me's. Who gives a shit? I'm still here. Becca, where are you going? No, I am done helping you. Becca, don't. You can't leave! And neither can I, okay. When it happens, you're just stuck. I figured that out early on. You piece of shit. Becca, I... It's not like I was ever getting out anyway, right? You know, Mom was supposed to take me to the Oceanarium in Hampton Beach. And then you got sick, so we didn't go. I came home and stayed with you all night. That was the last time we were there. We never went back after she died. And then after you threw up on Darryl at my prom, everybody ditched me. So I left early and came home to check on you. When I got that acceptance letter, I couldn't believe I got in. I don't even know why I applied. It's like I was pretending my life could be something else. I lied to myself. And I lied to you. Matt was right. We really do deserve each other. Look at us. Can I borrow some pyjama pants? I gotta get out of these. Would you give it a rest, please? I figured it out. Lay it on me. The brain. It didn't come back because we got his brain. You can't make a copy once the master copy is gone, right. We break the pattern. Richie. None of this was my original plan. I didn't want to come back. Jesus, Richie is that... Dad's rifle. This is how it ends. And then maybe, maybe you can leave. And maybe not. Maybe that's not what's gonna happen. Maybe you'll end up like that thing. I doubt it. This is all my fault. I'm the cause. You're caught up in my loop. So maybe, if I close it for good, then you can walk out of here. I can't let you do that. Look, I didn't mean what I said before. This is not a life. I can help you. This is not a life for you, Becca. And you deserve to have one. Can I show you something? Take a closer look. What do you see? I don't know. I still see an asshole. Exactly. Richie! Open the door! That is all I see when I look at myself is one giant asshole. I know how much you've done for me, how much you do and it kills me that you couldn't share such good news with me. I have been trying for so long to get better for you. But I'm tired, Becca, I'm tired and I don't want to feel like this anymore. I've been cutting myself up into pieces, trying to put them back in a way that works. But I can't. And then this crazy thing starts happening. And I think, maybe, maybe there could be a better version of me somewhere in there. But every time I come back, I'm the exact same, the exact fucking same, just me. I'm proud of you. I am so proud of you for taking a chance on yourself and proving that you can have the life that you want. This is gonna work, I know it and then you can go and there will be nothing holding you back. And you'll be great and you're gonna help so many people. I can take care of you. I can, I know it. You have. This is not on you, little sister. It's on me, it's always been on me. Just try to remember that. You don't hold me back. And you don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. Please, I need you in my life. It's not the same without you. I love you. I love you so much. No. Richie! No. No. Richie! No, turn it off! No. No. Come on! Be wrong! Come on. Goddam you!
