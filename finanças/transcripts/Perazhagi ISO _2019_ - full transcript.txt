THE SEA RESEARCHERS FOUND IT It is a precious thing which no one got who went deep and searched for it. It has been found now. 400 years back, 'king of Varungapuri, Mahendra Bhoopathy' 'he goes to the girl's place without brushing his teeth.' King! You are going to get the bad name that you killed all the sparrows for this medicinal herd! Hey! Go! 'Even if he goes to the prostitute's place with the herbs, ' 'what is possible with him?' Come on! For someone who can't cut! He is having 52 knifes! 'They used to speak ill of him like that.' 'Getting furious with this, he put his drums.' Anyone who brings the herbs and medicines to bring back youth for Mahendra Bhoopathy will be rewarded with half of the treasury. After 2 days he got a news. I heard about your grievance. I will come soon with medicinal recipes to make you young. I will come in another two days. 'The prince who heard this, ' 'got angry and left thinking what will he do if the king himself keeps ruling!' 'He caught that doctor and killed him right there!' 'He threw that medicinal recipe too in the river.' 'The one which went in the river has only been got in the sea.' 'I will say something in the gap he is drinking his tea!' 'He is the MD of Fashion Fab!' 'Every day he was the one who gets the best skin care award.' 'But this year?' 'Hi!' 'Our company's investment' 'is the interest people show in the beauty and health.' 'Our work is not just to manufacture things.' 'We should manufacture even then mentality for people to buy the product.' 'We need to bring the mind set to buy a product without thinking.' 'We have done that successfully.' 'This award is for that! Thank you once again.' - What is going on in India? - It is a viral sympathy, sir. I don't want excuses. We have to succeed.

"Smile please..." Hey go! Oh, God! Hey, this crow has the work to shit on me! Who is that? How many times have I told you? Not to rent out the upper portion to bachelors! Did you see the work they did? They are very good boys! You are talking bad about them! Who? Them? Those people getting up is like a girl standing with her skirt raised. That is how they are opening their eyes. You are calling them good boys! Mom! Yes. - How is it? - Show me! If you pay so much and buy it will be nice only. - Tell me! - I saw yesterday on youtube. What did you see? I told one boy got hit at the marriage right? That video. Hey, tell me what it is. I was telling you only all this while. You were talking to my grandma only all this time. - Tell! - She spoke in your voice! She will talk even in Rajinikanth's voice. I was the one who uploaded on youtube. Like are increasing. Ten thousand! Then don't talk anything without knowing who it is. You said you will come and! Okay, I will call later. Grandma? - It is my dress grandma! - Yes. What is this grandma?

First remove my dress. I will remove. But slippers! New slippers, new dress! You are enjoying! There is nothing in this! Oh, God! Madam, is grandma there? Grandma is not there. She has gone out? - What sister? - I came to see if grandma is there. She is here! - Oh my! - Idiot! Go. I will come and give it myself. Just for Rs. 500 you have come in search of my house. You are staring at me if I come to ask the money I gave? Look at the dress at this age! What is this grandma? Why did you borrow money from them? For this only! Brother, she is so dark. What to beautify her? What man? Do you think so ill about black? Brother, she herself is thinking bad about being black. Hey, 75% are black in our country. If you see that way, it is like spitting lying down upright! Hey, do you know what they have told about black? Hey, dictionary says dark, dirt and sin. All these are mind set by English people. He is saying black money, black sheep! He is saying black day! What is all this? He is using black to symbolize all the bad things. If something bad happens, they print black posters. They print black notice. What is all this? Won't you all change at all? Leave all that brother. All my dream and wish is to take photographs of different models. The photo I take should only come in all magazines. Do you know what you should do for that? You should become friends with a beautiful girl. You should click pictures of her. You should send that photo to Ad company. Are you listening to what I am saying? Hey what is this buddy? You said beauty competition but come to oldies competition? Go! This competition is for grandma's who are beautiful. This? "Yes!" "This one's like you!" "All ladies and gentleman!" "Yes!" "Let's go! Beauty!" "This is very good!" "Let's go for party!" "The naughtiness which happens!" "This beauty garden is going for ultra-modern beauty!" "In the dried hair she is applying color dough!" "Chukchuk! Is the train flying?" "A dancing peacock? Or the walking rain?" "It will be shocking!" "Sweet coconut. Is it a comforting way?" "Look what is the change between the two." "She is the titanic youth!" "She is the poem written by Kambar." "She has not done what is hit!" "Just like a beautiful cat in Andaman, smiling heartily, walking slowly!" "If the beauty goes for walking..." "60 with turn into youth!" "That's right!" "Watching Rajini movie!" "Boss..." - "Anger will only be showered." - It's very spicy. "She is dancing rap pose for Vijay's birthday!" "She has switched on the AV and posting on facebook." "What a nice feeling?" "The share will go increasing!" "Keeping the hands!" "She will do magic and show!" "Is it dream or unconsciousness?" "A little dream and little unconscious." "Dream or conscious! Dream or conscious! Dream or conscious!" Hey! It is waste to have kept you the name of your grandpa, Veerasami. You don't even have quarter of the guts your grandpa had. You have to learn! "There are no days without fights." "Dining table will go hasty!" "At midnight!" "10 ton of affection will flow!" "Even the next door dog is affectionate!" "She is talking so proud showing her young age album!" "Age is just like a rotten cashew." "Heart is a tender cucumber." "Simply giving a cinema look!" "Reading the femina book!" "Dream or conscious! Dream or conscious!" "Dream or conscious! Dream or conscious! Dream or conscious! Dream or conscious!" This year's winner is Ms. Lily! Sponsor by Present man! Hey, stop! - Change the decision. - You are doing injustice. - No, it's a fraud. - You are not doing it right. - Why are you shouting like this? - Get them out. - Peace! Peace! Listen to me. - What is going on here? - Stop! Stop! - This things will not happen here. - Let them get out! - Please. Listen to what I am saying. That all I don't know. Oh, God! You are doing everything right? - I got nothing! - You need this! - She is dancing, see! - Shit! - You lost is it? - You are going for competition, is it? You need it! You need it! Save it. What is all this mom? Do you know how ashamed I feel? I am not able to walk on the road mom. Everyone is talking bad and teasing asking, "What, your mom is competing in beauty competition?" Do you know big a dishonor is it for the family? That is why I am saying. Where is she listening? She is wearing lipstick. She is wearing nighty! She is wearing modern dress also! - Did anyone stop you from wearing? - Oh my... All other oldies are eating what is given and staying in a corner. Otherwise they go on tour to Kasi and Rameswaram. My fate! Looks like you will put me in a hostel! It is called old age home! Will anyone marry her if someone knows she has such a grandma? Can't you be a little controlled at least till she is married? -Hey! - What is this? - Oh dad, she has so many fans also. Men who have no teeth are going behind calling themselves youth! Not just that, she is the leader for that team! It is wrong to tell girls to be modest and submissive. But... No! Should I be submissive with you? When we are young we have to be submissive to parents. After marriage we should be submissive to husband. In the end we have to be submissive to son. Will I be modest with you? Go man! What is that competition? Miskey Rani? It is okay if you had won that and got Rs. One lakh. She has lost and now arguing. Look here mom. I don't care whatever you do. Don't spoil my daughter's life alone. That is all I say! - I will find an end to it. - Dad... Hey! She is my grand-daughter. I raised this grand-daughter. Don't I care about her life? Go! Grandma! Grandma, open the door grandma! Grandma, what are you doing grandma? Grandma... Grandma... Grandma! What are you doing grandma? Open the door, grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Sorry, grandma! Please! Dad said that unknowingly, grandma. Sorry, grandma! Yes. Listening to your mom blabber, your dad will also blabber. Should I listen to all that? I cannot be here. Go! Grandma! I am sorry! Don't go! Don't go! - Listen to me. Don't go! - Grandma! - Grandma, sorry grandma! - No. - Listen to me. - No! Sorry, grandma! What will I do without you? Grandma! Grandma! Please, grandma! Grandma... Grandma!
