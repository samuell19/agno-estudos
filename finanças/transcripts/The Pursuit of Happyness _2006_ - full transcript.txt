Time to get up, man. All right, Dad. Come on. Should be here soon. I think I should make a list. Uh, what do mean? For your birthday gifts? Yeah. Well, you know you're only getting a couple of things, right? Yeah, I know. Just to look at and study, so I can choose better. Okay, well, that's smart. Yeah, make a list. Can you spell everything you're thinking of? I think so. All right. That's good. How you doing in here, man? Okay. Can we go to the park today? After? Um. No, I gotta go to Oakland. Well, uh... maybe. We'll see. Give me a kiss. I'll talk to you later. Excuse me. Oh. Excuse me, uh... when is, uh, somebody gonna clean this off? And... And... And the Y? The Y. We talked about this. It's an I in "happiness." There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I. I'm Chris Gardner. I met my father for the first time when I was 28 years old. And I made up my mind as a young kid that when I had children, my children were gonna know who their father was. This is part of my life story. This part is called "Riding the Bus." What's that? It's a time machine, isn't it? Seems like a time machine. That seems like a time machine. It's a time machine. Take me with you. This machine... This machine on my lap... This guy, he has a time machine. He... He... He travels. He travels in the past with this machine and... it is not a time machine. It's a portable bone-density scanner. A medical device I sell for a living. Thank you for the opportunity to... To discuss it with you. I appreciate it. We just don't need it, Chris. It's unnecessary. And expensive. Well, maybe next... Thank you. It gave a slightly denser picture than an x-ray... for twice the money. - Hey. - Hey, baby. What happened? Uh... No, nothing. Look, I can't get Christopher today. Oh, no, you don't, Chris. I need... I'm back on at 7. I know. I have got to go to Oakland. So I gotta get Christopher home, feed him, bathe him, get him in bed, and be back here by 7? Yes. And we got the tax bill notice today. What are you gonna do about that? Look. This is what we gotta do. You see that car? The one with the pretty yellow shoe on it? That's mine. There's no parking near hospitals. That's what happens when you're always in a rush. Thanks anyway. Uh, very much. Uh... Uh, maybe next quarter. It's possible. I needed to sell at least two scanners a month for rent and daycare. I'd have to sell one more to pay off all of those tickets under my windshield wiper. The problem is... I haven't sold any for a while. Since when do you not like macaroni and cheese? Since birth? What's that? What? What is this? It's a gift for Christopher. From who? Cynthia from work. It's for adults. Chris can't use it. She didn't know. What are you supposed to do with it? Make every side the same color. Did you pay the taxes? No, I'm gonna have to, uh, file an extension. You already filed an extension. Yeah, well, I gotta file another one. That's... It's $650. I'll have it in the next month. That means interest, right? And a penalty? Yeah, a little bit. Look, why don't you let me do this? All right, just relax. Okay? Now, come here. Calm down. I have to go back to work. Let's get ready for bed. Hey, uh, put your plate in the sink. A few days ago I was presented with a report I'd asked for. A comprehensive audit, if you will, of our economic condition. You won't like it. I didn't like it. But we have to face the truth and then go to work to turn things around. And make no mistake about it... we can turn them around. The federal budget is out of control. And we face runaway deficits of almost $80 billion for this budget year that ends September 30th. That deficit is larger than the entire federal budget in 1957. And so is the almost $80 billion we will pay in interest this year on the national debt. Twenty years ago, in 1960, our federal government payroll was less than $13 billion. Today it is 75 billion. During these 20 years, our population has only increased by 23.3 percent... Woo! Man. I got two questions for you: What do you do? And how do you do it? I'm a stockbroker. Stockbroker. Oh, goodness. Had to go to college to be a stockbroker, huh? You don't have to. Had to be good with numbers and good with people. That's it. Hey, you take care. Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on to my car for the weekend. But I need it back for Monday. Feed the meter. I still remember that moment. They all looked so... damn happy to me. Why couldn't I look like that? I'm gonna try to get home by 6. I'm, uh, gonna stop by a brokerage firm after work. For what? I wanna see about a job there. Yeah? What job? Uh, you know, when I... When I was a kid, I could go through a... A math book in a week. So I'm gonna go see about, uh, a job they got down there. Oh. What job? Stockbroker. Stockbroker? Yeah. Not an astronaut? Don't talk to me like that, Linda. I'm gonna go down to see about this, and I'm gonna do it during the day. Mm-hm. You should probably do your sales calls. I don't need you to tell me about my sales calls, Linda. I got three of 'em before the damn office is even open. Do you remember that rent is due next week? Probably not. We're already two months behind. Next... Next week we'll owe three months. I've been pulling double shifts for... For four months now, Chris. Just... Just sell what's in your contract. Get us out of that business. Linda. That is what I am trying to do. This is what I'm trying to do for my family. For you and for Christopher. What's the matter with you? Linda. Linda. This part of my life is called... "Being Stupid." Can I ask you a favor, miss? Do you mind... if I leave this here with you, um, just for five minutes? I have a meeting in there, and I don't wanna carry that in there looking smalltime. Um... here is a dollar. And... I'll give you more money when I come back out. Okay. Um, it's not valuable. You can't sell it anywhere. Um, I-I can't even sell it, and it's my job. Chris? Yes. Tim Brophy, Resources. How are you? Come with me. Yes, sir. Let me see if I can find you an application for our internship. I'm afraid that's all we can do for you. See, this is a satellite office. Jay Twistle in the main office, he oversees Witter Resources. I mean, I'm... You know, I'm just this office. As you can see, we got a hell of a lot of applications here... Normally I have a resume sheet, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. W-we, uh... Uh... Um... Thank you very much. I need to go. Um... I'll... I'll br... I'll bring this back. Thank you. Okay. Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner. Why did I do that? Excuse me. Excuse me. Like I said, this part of my life is called "Being Stupid." Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move! Don't move! Stay...! Stop! Stop! Don't move! Stop this...! Stop the train! Stop! Stop! The program took just 20 people every six months. One got the job. There were three blank lines after "high school" to... list more education. I didn't need that many lines. Try and sleep. It's late. It's a puzzle measuring just three inches by three inches on each side, made up of multiple colors that you twist and turn, and try to get to a solid color on each side. This little cube is the gift sensation of 1981. Don't expect to solve it easily. Although we did encounter one math professor at USF who took just 30 minutes on his. This is as far as I've gotten on mine. As you can see, I still have a long way to go. This is Jim Finnerty reporting for KJSF in Richmond. Hey. Wake up. Eat. Bye, Mom. Bye, baby. Come back without that, please. Oh. Yeah, I'm going to. So go ahead, say goodbye to it, 'cause I'm coming back without it. Goodbye and good riddance. You ain't had to add the "good riddance" part. Bye, Mom. Bye. It's written as P-P-Y, but it's supposed to be an I in "happiness." Is it an adjective? Uh, no. Actually, it's a noun. But it's not spelled right. Is "fuck" spelled right? Yeah, that's spelled right. But that's not part of the motto, so you're not supposed to learn that. That's an adult word to show anger and, um... other things. But just don't... Don't use that one, okay? Okay. What's that say on the back of your bag? My nickname. We pick nicknames. Oh, yeah? What's it say? "Hot Rod." Did you have a nickname? Yep. What? "Ten-Gallon Head." Heh-heh. What's that? I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas. So everybody wears cowboy hats. And a... A ten-gallon's a big hat. I was smart back then, so they called me Ten-Gallon Head. Hoss wears that hat. Hoss? Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza. How do you know Bonanza? We watch it at Mrs. Chu's. You watch Bonanza at daycare? Yeah. When? When do...? When do you watch it? After snack? After your nap? After Love Boat. I made my list for my birthday. Yeah, what'd you...? What did you put on there? A basketball... or an ant farm. He says he's been watching TV. Oh, little TV for history. Love Boat? For history. Navy. That's... That's not the Navy. I mean, he... He could watch television at home. We're paying you $150 a month. I-if he's gonna be sitting around watching TV all day, we're taking him out of here. Go pay more at other daycare if you don't like Navy TV. You late pay anyway. You complain. I complain. Can you at least put the dog upstairs in you room or something? Bye. I was waiting for... Witter Resource head, Jay Twistle, whose name sounded so delightful, like he'd give me a job and a hug. I just had to show him I was good with numbers and good with people. Morning, Mr. Twistle. Good morning. Mr. Twistle. Chris Gardner. Hi. Hi. I wanted to drop this off personally and make your acquaintance. I thought I'd catch you on the way in. I'd really love the opportunity to sit and discuss what may seem like weaknesses on my application. We'll start with this, Chris, and we'll call you if we wanna sit down. Yes, sir. You have a great day. You too. Hey. Uh, yeah, how you doing? This is Chris Gardner calling for Dr. Delsey. Uh, yeah, look, I'm running a little late for a sales call. I was... I was wondering if... Yeah, Osteo National. Right. Uh, we can still...? Half an hour? Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you, thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey! This part of my life... Wait! This part here... it's called "Running." Hey! Hey! Wait! Hey! Wait! That was my stolen machine. Unless she was with a guy who sold them too. Which was unlikely... because I was the only one selling them in the Bay Area. I spent our entire life savings on these things. It was such a revolutionary machine. Ooh. Can you feel it, baby? Oh, yeah. You got me doing all the work. What I didn't know is that doctors and hospitals would consider them unnecessary luxuries. I even asked the landlord to take a picture. So if I lost one, it was like losing a month's groceries. Hey, hey! Wait! Wait! Hey! Get back here! Hey, man, uh... Uh, I... Uh... Who's he? He's that guy. Did you forget? Forget what? You're not supposed to have any of those. Yeah, I know. You have two now. Hey. Hey, Mom. One... two... Two. three! Whoo! That's a basketball! Hey, hey. What do you mean? You don't know that that's a basketball. This could be an ant farm. This... This could be a... A microscope or anything. No, it's not. There, there. All right, come on. Open him up. Open him up. That paper's a little heavy, huh? Yeah, but I got it. Yeah, you should've seen me out there today. Uh... Somebody, uh, stole a scanner. I had to run the old girl down... Whatever. What? Whatever, Chris. What the hell you got attitude about? "Whatever" what? Every day's got some damn story. Hey, hey, Roy. Roy! Can you beat your little rug when nobody's out here? There's dust and shit all over. I'm trying to keep a clean house. Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. Listen. Look, Linda. Relax. We're gonna come out of this. Everything is gonna be fine, all right? You said that before, when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine." So you don't trust me now? Whatever. I don't care. Taxi! Mr. Twistle. Yeah, hi. Hi. Chris Gardner. Yeah, hi. Listen. What can I do for you? I submitted an application for the intern program about a month ago, and I would just love to sit with you briefly... Listen, I'm going to Noe Valley, Chris. Uh, take care of yourself. Mr. Twistle. Actually, I'm on my way to Noe Valley also. Uh... how about we share a ride? All right, get in. All right. So when I was in the Navy, I worked for a doctor who loved to play golf, hour... Hours every day. And... I would actually... perform medical procedures when he'd leave me in the office. So... I'm... I'm used to being in a position where... Where I have to make decisions and... Mr. Twistle. Listen, this is... This is a very important... I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh. Th... This thing's impossible. I can do it. No, you can't. No one can. That's bullshit. No. I'm pretty sure I can do it. Mm. No, you can't. Let me see it. Give it here. Oh, yeah. Oh. Wow, you... You, uh, really messed it up. Heh. Sorry. Uh... it... It looks like it... It, uh, works around a swivel, so the center pieces never move. So if it's yellow in the center, that's the yellow side. Right. If it's red in the center, that's the... red side. Okay. All right. So... You... You can slow down. Uh, listen, we can drive around all day. I don't believe you can do this. Uh, yeah, I can. No. No, you can't. Yes, I can. No, you can't. I'm telling you, no one can. It's tough. See? That's all I ever do. Uh, uh, uh... Y-you almost have this side. Holy cow. Oh. Oh, you almost had that one. I'm gonna get it. Look at that. You're almost there. 17.10. Oh, this is me. Good job. Goodbye. Yeah. I'll see... See you soon. Uh, where are you going, sir? Excuse me, sir. Where are you going, please? Uh... Um... Uh, two... A couple blocks. Just, you know, flip around. Okay. Hey! Stop it! Hey! Where are you going?! Come here! No! No! No. No, no, no, no! Hey! You asshole. Give me my money! Give me my money. Please stop. Please, please. Please! Son of a bitch. Please! He should've paid you! He should've paid you! Come here! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Come here. I'll kick your ass! I'm sorry! Idiot. I'll get you! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! Hey! Stop it, you son of a bitch! Stop him! Stop him! The doors are closing. Please stand clear of the doors. No! No! No! No! Hello? Hey. Yeah. Sorry... Sorry I couldn't make it home on time. Chris. I missed my shift. Yeah, I... I know. I'm sorry about that. Look, um... I'm on my way right now. Are you all right with Christopher? I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving. What? Did you hear what I said? I have my things together, and I'm taking our son... and we're gonna leave now. I'm gonna put the phone down... Linda. Wait a minute. Hold it... Hold... We are leaving. It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson... Wait, wait! and the Declaration of Independence... and the part about our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And I remember thinking: How did he know... to put the "pursuit" part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue. And maybe we can actually never have it... no matter what. How did he know that? Linda. Linda. Hello? Chris. Who is this? Jay Twistle. Uh... Hey. Dean Witter. Yeah, of course. Uh... Uh... how are you? I'm fine. Listen, do you still wanna come in and talk? Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'll tell you what. Come on by day after tomorrow, in the morning. We're interviewing for the internships. You got a pen and paper? Uh. Yes. Uh, yes, I do. Um... Uh. Hold on one second. All right. Hello? Chris? Uh... Uh, go ahead. I have one. Write this number down so you can call my secretary, Janice, and she can give you all the specifics. Yep. Okay, 415. 415. 864. 864. 0256. 0256. Yeah, extension 4796. 4796. Right. Call her tomorrow. Yes, sir. 415-864-0256. Okay, buddy. All right, yes. Thank you very much. We'll see you soon. 864-0256. 4796. Janice. Chris. Hey. Did you, uh...? Have you seen, uh, Linda and Christopher? No. You catch the game last night? No, no. You didn't see that, 118-1... One... Excuse me, did, uh, Linda and Christopher come in here? No, I haven't see them. 119-120. Double overtime. Moons hits a three-pointer, 17 seconds left. Wayne, Wayne, Wayne. Can't talk to you about numbers right now. What's your problem with numbers? 8642. And you owe me money. Yeah. You owe me $14. I'm gonna get that to you. I need my money. I need my money. Fourteen's a number. Hey. Don't you ever take my son away from me again. Do you hear me? Leave me alone! Don't take my son away from me again. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Do you hear me? Do you wanna leave? Yeah. You wanna leave? Yes, I want to leave! Get the hell out of here, then, Linda. Get the hell out of here. Christopher's staying with me. You're the one that dragged us down. You hear me? You are so weak... No. I am not happy anymore. I'm just not happy! Then go get happy, Linda! Just go get happy. But Christopher's living with me! Stop! Did you hear what I said?! Christopher's living with me! Hey. Come... Come on. Let's go. How you doing, Mrs. Chu? Hi. Where's Mom? Look, just get... Get your stuff. But she told me she was coming to pick me up today. Uh... Yeah, I know. Um... I talked to Mom earlier. Everything is fine, okay? Where do I sleep tonight? Let me ask you something. Are you happy? Yeah. All right. Because I'm happy. And if you're happy and I'm happy, then that's a good thing, right? Yeah. Yeah. All right. You're s... You're sleeping with me. You're staying at home, uh, where you... Where you belong, all right? Uh... Come on. Christopher. Hey. Listen, I need the rent. Yeah. I can't wait anymore. Yeah, uh... I'm good for that, Charlie. I'm gonna get it. Why don't you go two blocks over at the Mission Inn motel? It's half what you pay here. Listen, Chris. I need you out of here in the morning. The hell am I supposed to be out of here tomorrow? I got painters coming in. All right. All right, look. I need more time. No. All right... I'll paint it myself. All right, but I... I just... I gotta have some more time... I got my son up in here. All right. One week. And you paint it. Chris Gardner? Uh, yeah. What happened? Payable to the City of San Francisco. Does it have to be the... The full amount? Well, you gotta pay each parking ticket. Otherwise, you're staying. This is all I got. You verify at 9:30 tomorrow morning. What? Yeah, you gotta stay until this thing clears. No. No, I... I can't... I can't spend the night here. I... I have to pick up my son. You verify at 9:30 tomorrow. Sir... I have a job interview at Dean Witter at 10:15 tomorrow morning. I cannot stay... 9:30 tomorrow morning. What am I supposed to do with my son? Is there anyone else who can...? I take care of him. Maybe we can go and have Social Services pick him up. All right. Uh, can I make... Have my phone call, please? Hello. Hey. What do you want? Um... you gotta get Christopher, uh... from daycare. I can't... Um... Just keep him for the night, and I'm gonna... I... And, uh... Just one night. What happened? I'll pick him up from, uh, daycare... tomorrow. I'm gonna go right... You can just... You can drop him off, and I'll pick him up. No. Come on, Linda. Why you...? Why you doing that? No. I wanna take him to the park. To Golden Gate... after daycare tomorrow. How is he? He's fine. All right, just... All right, take him to the park... and... And... bring him back, all right? All right, just... bring... Bring me my son back. Okay? Linda? I'll bring him back around 6. All right. All right. Uh... thank you. Um... All right. Bye. I'm okay? Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes, I did. Mr. Gardner. This way. It'll be right this way. What is the word on that one? Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner. How are you? Good morning. Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner. Good to see you again. Chris Gardner. Pleasure. I've been sitting there for the last half hour trying to come up with a story that would explain my being here dressed... like this. And... And I wanted to come up with a story that would demonstrate qualities that I'm sure you all admire here, like... Like earnestness or diligence. And team-playing. Something. And I couldn't think... of anything. So the truth is... I was arrested for failure to pay parking tickets. Parking tickets? What? And I ran all the way here from the... The Polk Station, the police station. What were you doing before you were arrested? I was, uh... painting my apartment. Is it dry now? Uh. I hope so. Jay says you're pretty determined. Oh, he's been waiting outside the front of the building with some 40-pound gizmo for over a month. He said you're smart. Well, I like to think so. And you want to learn this business? Yes, sir, I wanna learn this business. Have you already started learning on your own? Absolutely. Jay? Yes, sir. How many times have you seen Chris? Yeah, I don't know. One too many, apparently. Was he ever dressed like this? No. No. Jacket and tie. First in your class in school? High school? Yes, sir. How many in the class? Uh, 12. It was a small town. I'll say. But I was also first in my radar class in... In the Navy, and that was a class of 20. Can I say something? Uh... Um... I'm the type of person... if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what. I know how to find the answer. And I will find the answer. Is that fair enough? Chris. What would you say if a guy walked in for an interview without a shirt on... and I hired him? What would you say? He must've had on some really nice pants. Chris... I don't know how you did it dressed as a garbage man, but you really pulled it off. Thank you very much, Mr. Twistle. Hey, now you can call me Jay. We'll talk to you soon. All right, so I'll let you know, Jay. You'll... "You'll let me know, Jay"? What do you mean? Yeah. I'll give you a call tomorrow sometime... What are you talking...? You hounded me for this. You stood here... Listen. There's no salary. No. I was not aware of that. My circumstances have changed some, and I need to be certain that I'll be... All right. Okay. Tonight. I swear, I will fill your spot. I promise. If you back out, you know what I'll look like to the partners? Yes. An ass... A-hole. Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way. You are a piece of work. Tonight. There was no salary. Not even a reasonable promise of a job. One intern was hired at the end of the program from a pool of 20. And if you weren't that guy, you couldn't even apply the six months' training to another brokerage. Only resource I would have for six months would be my six scanners... which I could still try to sell. If I sold them all... maybe we might get by. I got him. I got him. He's asleep. All right. Okay, baby. I got it. I'm going to New York. Uh. My sister's boyfriend... opened a restaurant, and they may have a job for me there, so... I'm going to New York, Chris. Christopher's staying with me. I'm his mom. You know? He should be with his mom. I should have him, right? You know you can't take care of him. What are you gonna do for money? I had an... interview at Dean Witter for... For an internship. And I got it. So I'm gonna stand out in my program. Salesman to intern's backwards. No, it's not. I gotta go. Tell him I love him, okay? And... I know you'll take care of him, Chris. I know that. Dean Witter. Yes, hi. Um... Yes, uh, I'd like to leave a message for... For Mr. Jay Twistle. Your name? Uh... Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner. Uh... Uh, the message is: Thank you very much for... For inviting me into the program. Uh, I really appreciate it, and... I'd be very pleased to accept your invitation. Is that all? Yes, that's... That's it. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Be careful with that. What? Be care... Go ahead. Are we there? Yep. Hey. You know what today is? Yeah. What? Saturday. You know what Saturday is, right? Yeah. What? Basketball. You wanna go play some basketball? Okay. All right. Then we're gonna go sell a bone density scanner. How about that? Wanna do that? No. Hey, Dad, I'm going pro. Oh. I'm going pro. Oh-ho! Okay. Yeah. I don't know, you know. Uh... you'll probably be about as good as I was. That's kind of the way it works, you know. And I... I was below average. You know, so... Whoa. So you'll probably ultimately rank... somewhere around there, you know, so... I really... You'll excel at a lot of things, just not this. So I don't want you out here shooting this ball around all day and night, all right? All right. Okay. All right, go ahead. Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you... you can't do something. Not even me. All right? All right. You got a dream... you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period. Let's go. Dad. Why did we move to a motel? I told you. Because I'm... I'm getting a better job. You gotta trust me, all right? I trust you. All right, here. Come on, come on. Come on. Keep up. Dad, when's Mom coming back? Dad. When's Mom coming back? I don't know, Christopher. Dad, listen to this. One day, a man was drowning in the water. And a boat came by and said, "Do you need any help?" He said, "No, thank you. God will save me." Then another boat came by. Said, "Do you need any help?" And he said, "No, thank you. God will save me." Then he drowned, and he went to heaven. And he said, "God, why didn't you save me?" And God said, "I sent you two big boats, you dummy." Do you like it? Yeah, that's very funny, man. Give me your hand. Oh. Thank you very much, sir. Yes, sir. You got the bill of sale here. Yes. All the information you'll need. Uh, thank you very much for your business. Thank you. Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please. One hundred, 200, 20, 40, 45, 46, 7, 8, 9, 10. Thank you. Hey, you want one of those? No, it's okay. Come on, you can have one. Which one? You like that one? How much? Twenty-five cents. This part of my life is called "Internship." The 1200 building is Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil. The building across the street is Lee-Ray Shipping. In a couple of weeks, you'll get call sheets with the phone numbers of employees from every Fortune 500 company in the financial district. You will be pooling from 60 Fortune companies. You will mainly be cold-calling potential clients. But if you have to have lunch with them, have breakfast with them, even babysit for them, you will do whatever it takes to familiarize them with our packages. We need you to match their needs and goals to one of our many financial plans. In essence... you reel them in, we'll cook the fish. Some of you guys are here because you know somebody. Some of you are here because you think you're somebody. But there's one guy in here who's gonna be somebody. That person's gonna be the guy... who can turn this into this. Eight hundred thousand in commission dollars. You, you, help me hand these out. This is going to be your bible. You'll eat with it. You'll drink with it. It was simple. X number of calls equals X number of prospects. X number of prospects equals X number of customers. X number of customers equals X number of dollars in the company's pocket. Your board exam. Last year, we had an intern score a 96.4 percent on the written exam. He wasn't chosen. It's not a simple pass/fail. It's an evaluation tool we use to separate applicants. Be safe. Score a hundred. Okay. Let's take a break. Be back in 10. Oh. Hey. Mr. Frohm. Hi. Uh, Chris. Ah, Chris, how are you? I'm good. How you doing? Fine, thank you for asking. Yeah, uh, first day in there. It was, uh, exciting. You're not quitting on us yet, are you? Oh, no. No, sir. Ten-minute break. Uh... Pop out, get a quick bite, and then back in there for board prep. Oh, man, I remember mine. And ours were only an hour, not three like yours. We didn't do world markets, we didn't bother with taxes, and it was still a pain in the ass. Funny what you remember.

And maybe we're going to the game. All right. Where are we going now? Uh, to see someone about my job. I don't understand. You don't understand what? Are we going to the game? I said possibly we're going to the game. You know what "possibly" means? Like probably. No, "probably" means there's a good chance that we're going. "Possibly" means we might, we might not. What does "probably" mean? It means we have a good chance. And what does "possibly" mean? I know what it means. What does it mean? It means that we're not going to the game. How did you get so smart? Cause you're smart. Are we there? Yeah. Mr. Ribbon. Yes? How are you, sir? Chris Gardner. Dean Witter. Oh, hi. Hi. This is my son, Christopher. Hi. Hey, Christopher. W-w-what are you doing up here?

I-I want you to know that I do not take that for granted. Oh, come on. W-what, uh... What's that? Oh, this... Uh, an Osteo National bone-density scanner. Oh. A company I bought into prior to going to work at Witter. I have a meeting after the game. You guys are going to the game? Oh, yeah. Possibly. Possibly. We're... We're going too.

No. Well... It's not actually a box. It's... It's, um... a private section. It's more comfortable. You wanna go? Okay. Okay. Kids in the back. Hey, why don't you just put that in your car? Um... Yeah, okay... Uh, sure. Sure. We don't have a car. Ah! Oh, my G... What happened? I think I got stung by a bee. You all right? Oh. Yeah. Goodness. I'm fine. You're not allergic or anything?

Christopher. Sit back. Sit back. Thomas Jefferson mentions happiness a couple times in the Declaration of Independence. May seem like a strange word to be in that document, but... he was sort of... He was an artist. He called the English, "the disturbers of our harmony." And I remember standing there that day thinking about the disturbers of mine. Questions I had. Whether... all this was good. Whether I'd make it. And Walter Ribbon, and his Pacific Bell pension money, which was millions. Yeah! It was a way to another place. Wow. This is, aah... This is the way to watch a football game here. Thank you very much for this, really. Hey, that's my pleasure, Chris. And, uh, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss the asset management capabilities of Dean Witter, which we believe to be far superior to anything you got going over at Morgan Stanley. And, uh, really, I think you're gonna be blown away. Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be managing your retirement portfolio. You know, I didn't have any notion that you were new over there. I mean, I like you, but... there's not a chance I'm gonna let you direct our fund. That's just not gonna happen anytime soon, buddy. So... you know, come on, relax. Let's play the game. Go, go, go! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yeah! Whoo! Here you go. All right. I've had a few ideas already. Absolutely. Chris. I'll talk to you later. Thanks you very much. I'm gonna give you a call. Nice to meet you, Chris. Give me a call. Yes. Absolutely. Thank you. Bye. Bye, Christopher. After four months, we had sold all our scanners. It seemed we were making it. What's the... fastest animal in the world? Jackrabbit.

He doesn't know where it is though. Didn't you ever want to have a home of your own like other people? Sometimes when we're moving at night, we pass houses with lights and people. Sometimes you can hear them laugh. The next day... after work... we just went to the beach. Far away from anything. Everything. Just Christopher and me. Did you see me? Yep. Far away from... buses and noise and a constant disappointment in my 10-gallon head. And myself. Chris, thank you very much. Thank you, Dean. Take care, Chris. Hey, you made the right moves here. Thanks, Chris. Because when I was young and I'd get an A on a history test or whatever... I'd get this good feeling about all the things that I could be. And then I never became any of them. Hey, Chris. Hey. How are you doing, Jay? I'm doing fine. Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts for us from Pacific Bell. Yeah, I, uh... met some guys at a ball game, got some cards I've been working.
