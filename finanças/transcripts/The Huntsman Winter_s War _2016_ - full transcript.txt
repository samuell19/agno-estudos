Your possibilities will be endless once the magic awakens in your heart. It won't. We both know it won't. I'm not like you. All the women of our blood are gifted, Freya. And in time you will find the source of your power as I found mine. We'll see. What? You're carrying his child. Oh. You didn't know. Well, he's promised to another. He does not love her. Their engagement is sealed. It cannot be broken. He will deny you. And he will deny your daughter. He will not. Freya, I'm not being cruel. I simply wish to protect you. You may be surprised how things turn out. You know much, Ravenna. But you do not know all. I'm afraid I do. NARRATOR: Freya did not believe her sister, for love blinds even the clearest eye. And when her daughter was but a few weeks old, Freya's trusting heart was rewarded at last. (EXHALES) Her lover had sent word. He would defy his family and marry Freya in secret, in the Royal Garden. They would gather their child and flee the kingdom to begin a life of their own. (DISTANT RUMBLING) (PANTING) Freya, don't! (GRUNTING) (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) I had no choice. I had no choice, Freya. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SCREAMING)
