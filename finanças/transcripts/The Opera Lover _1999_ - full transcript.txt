(intense music) (upbeat music) - Perfect. (upbeat music) (sighs) (upbeat music) - (sighs) I want a divorce. - You're awake? You know those guys are customers, I have to show them a good time. - This is of no interest to me. - We ate, we played cards, the card game turned into a crap game. - I can smell her. It is not a pleasant smell. It smells like a wet poodle. - I don't know how to respond to that. - So I'm wrong? - Yeah, you're wrong. - Am I? - (pauses) Yes, you are. - Why the pause? - For emphasis. - I'll show you pause for emphasis. I want (pauses) a divorce. - Yeah, right, divorce. That's what you really wanna do, right? That's what you really wanna do, you wanna get a divorce? - No, what I really want is to cut your balls off and feed them to the dog next door, that's what I'd really like to do. - I thought you liked that dog. (sighs) Let's just, let's just go to bed and talk about it in the morning. - Do you know I don't think that you have made one single decision your entire adult life that you have been satisfied with. - What do you want from me? - (sighs) I told you. I want a divorce. - I don't want a divorce. - You don't, (scoffs) George, you don't know what you want. You only know what you don't want. - I love you. - I love you too, George. So what's your point? (upbeat orchestral music) (upbeat opera music) (dog barking in distance) - I'm Mr. Tardy on a school night. - That's fine. Just next time call. - Night, night, kid, night. Take it easy. - Hey sweetie. So did you catch anything? - Some, some little ones. - Do you wanna come in, get a drink, or something? - No, no, it's okay, I'm fine. - Why do I feel so terrible about this? - You shouldn't. - I do. - Well you're making a terrible mistake, let's face it. - Okay. - This is a big step. - Oh yeah, I really appreciate that coming from you. - I want you to be happy. You happy? - Yeah, I am. - Well, you could be making a big mistake. - I gotta go. - All right, all right, all right, I'm sorry. I got a wedding present for you. - Oh God. - Come on, it's just a little, it's four words. You say them to yourself whenever you're feeling bad for me, and then you'll be okay. - What are these magic words? - He had his chance. - (inhales) I hate you. - That's three words. That's even better. Really. - Go. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. (piano music) - So I says, I'll tell you what, stupid ass. You come in here, I'm going the fuck outside. I don't care, nobody listens to me anyway. - Look who it is? - Oh Jesus Christ. The prodigal son of bitch. Where the hell you been? - I've been around. - You ain't been around here. Marty here tells me you're good. - I'm good. - Don't lie to me, you son of a bitch. - I'd never lie to you. - He tells me your brother sold the business. - Going off to be a big time lawyer. - That right, George, your brother going off to be a big time lawyer? - Yeah, well, I guess it turns out we were a lawyer short. - Yeah. (scoffs) What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna stay. - You're gonna stay with the business? - Yeah, that's what I said. - As what? - As an employee. - Jesus. Is there a future in that? - I hope so, yeah. - I hope so too, because that's all you got is your future, right? - And your past. You have your past. - No, you don't have your past, stupid. You already had it. You have your future. Here. To your future. (glasses clinking) - What about the present? - What about it? - You have your present too. - Get off my ass, will ya? (piano music) ♪ She'll be wearin' red pajamas when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll be wearin' red pajamas when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll be ♪ (piano music) ♪ She'll be wearin' red pajamas ♪ (piano music) ♪ Pajamas when she comes ♪ (piano tempo increases) ♪ She'll be ridin' six white horses when she ♪ - You look really good, sweetie. - I know. - Hey you. - Hey you. - Can I buy you a drink? - Mm, I just got a fresh one but maybe I can use you later. - You uh, coming from somewhere? - Why do you ask? - I don't know, you look all puffed and powdered. - Are you trying to tell me I look nice? - You caught me. - Then why don't you go ahead and do it? - Okay. Hey, Bibi? - Mm-hmm. - You never looked better. - Oh, I don't know, George. I mean, you should've seen me yesterday. Or the day before that. Or the day before that. - I think I owe you an apology. - Mm, that's all right. Why apologize? You're no different that any other man. I know that, and I think you know that, and that's gotta hurt, and that's good enough for me. (quiet crowd chatter) (distant music) - [Bibi] Sure has been a while. - [George] Yeah, time flies. - [Bibi] Does it, George? - [George] Well sometimes, yeah, it really does. - [Bibi] Sometimes I feel like I'm always waiting. - [George] For what? - Beats me. Sometimes I can't help thinking that maybe that bus isn't coming back. You know? (laughs) Or maybe the bus came by and I just watched it ride away. - Yeah. - Do you ever think of it like that, George? - Like a bus? - I'm making an analogy, George. (sighs) - I know, I know. - Do you know what an analogy is? - Yeah, I know what an analogy is, I just, I just, you know, I never thought of it just that way. - Yeah. - But I know what you mean. - It's okay, George. - I know. - I know, but you don't have to see things the way I do all the time. (exhales) - Right. I don't blame you. Am I arguing with you, Pete? Yo, dad. I agree, Pete, I agree. You can't make potato soup without potatoes. Potatoes are key to that particular dish. Hang on, I'm checking. Oh, you're right, goddamn it, I'm sorry. Let me fix it. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, you can finish, I thought you were finished. - Let me talk to him, let me talk to him. Pilar? Pil? How the hell are you doing? How are you, it's me, George. Yeah, yeah, the good brother. What's the problem, we kill a busboy in the alley, or what? Yeah, didn't he say that he'd take care of it, huh? Well okay, come on, well what should we do, should we kill ourselves? Maybe that's it, maybe we should hang ourselves. I'm gonna hang my, I'm gonna let my brother hang himself. You know what? I'm gonna have him hang himself first. - Dad, the phone! - Would you do me a favor and spare my father so there'll be someone left for my mother to annoy? Didn't he say that he'd fix it? - He's in a meeting. - What's your problem? We're both in the service industry, okay? Yeah, I know that the customer's always right, but he doesn't have to be such an asshole about it. Yeah, well fuck you! Fuck you, the potatoes are on their way. Fuck you. Okay, say hello to Marie. I still gotta live with this guy. Okay, every day. Every day. - You got psycho on line one. Is she back in the picture now? - I'll take it outside. - She's psycho. (screeches) eek, eek, eek! - What the hell is going on here? - That you heard? I should get a phone that makes that kind of noise so you'll answer it once in a while. - Hello. - I know what you're thinking, here we go again with the crazy lady, right? - I wasn't, I wasn't thinking that. - I'm having a little crisis here. - What's the crisis? - Forget it. - No, no, really, I'm waiting to hear the crisis. - I hear it in your voice. - Look, I just, what's the crisis? - Remember I told you about that job interview I had today that I was very excited about? - Mm-hmm, job went away? - My car won't start! - Does it do anything? - It won't start, George, what else is it gonna do? - Well did you pump it? - Yes, I pumped it. - It's fuel injected, you're not supposed to pump it. - Okay, then I didn't pump it. Look, George, I really, really want this job. - You know, if you called a cab he could probably get there quicker than I could from here, I mean. - Fine, I'll call a cab. - No, what I'm trying to say is from where I am, by the time I got there, a cab would get you there a lot quicker. - Fine, that is fine. You know what? - Bibi, please. - If you had half a brain, or half a heart, or an ounce of common sense, you'd realize that I could use a little moral support here as much as some stupid, fucking ride. But, you know what, I could probably get more compassion from a fucking cab driver who's a total fucking stranger than I can from a man who was inside of me not 12 hours ago. (honking) Hello. (honking) He hated me. - That's impossible. - No, after every single thing I'd say, he'd say, "Really." After every single answer I gave to his stupid, fucking questions, he'd say, "Really." Like isn't that odd, or why on God's green earth would you say something ridiculous like that? I hate him, he's evil. You know, I have something to offer, would somebody please tell me what it is? (opera music) Are you listening to me? - Yeah, I hear you. You're setting off car alarms. - I want some answers. - What's the question? - What color is my parachute? - Red. - Why red? - I don't know, I, think of you, I think red. - I like that. I wonder what the hell it means. - I hear he's seeing Bibi again. Bibi Cairo. Great name for a broad. - She's psycho. - I'm just talkin' 'bout the name. - I don't care if her name is Cleopatra. She's a tumor. - Have you ever met her? - I don't have to meet her. - She's actually a very nice girl. - You think anyone with big boobs is a nice girl. - Roy has big boobs. I don't think he's a very nice girl. - She's his fucking ruination. - Gin. - You know what your problem is? You never had a girlfriend. - I never had a girlfriend? - Not since you've been married anyway. - No, not since I've been married. Maybe that's why I still have a wife. - I'm not saying it's good or bad, you just don't know how it feels, it's a different thing. - You never played around? - No. - Ever? - Never. Sorry to disappoint you. - Maybe you haven't met the right girl yet. - I married her. - I mean the (pauses) other right girl. (opera music) (applause) (cheering) (soft music) - (lightly laughs) Go to hell. Yeah, you heard me, I said, go to hell. You know that's your trouble. No one talks to you that way. Oh God, I feel sorry for you. Why, because it's pathetic. (soft music) Of course, I love you. Would I say all this if I didn't love you? (soft music) I have to go. Because, I have to go. (soft music) (light knocking) - [Woman] Do you need anything? - When I said I wanted to sell the business, you said, okay, right? - Right. - You didn't have to stay. I got the employment contract because you said you wanted to stay. - So. - So, I don't think you wanna stay. - Is that the impression I'm giving you? - Yes, it is. - I think I'm at a crossroads. - I think you're at an impasse. - Yeah, what's the difference? - They're totally different. - They aren't. - That's your problem. You don't know the difference between a crossroads and an impasse. - I don't think that's my problem. - I'd just feel much better if you had a plan. - I have a plan. - Fine, what's your plan? - If I told ya, it might not come true. - That's a wish. You can't tell a wish, you can tell a plan. - Well I think I got a wish. - Then you have crap. A wish without a plan is crap. You make everything so complicated. It's very simple, really. I mean, in the end, what is it you want? - The girl. - What girl? - Well that's the happy ending to all the stories, right? In the ending, he gets the girl. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - It's an analogy. - For what? - A bus. (upbeat orchestral music) - Ladies and gentlemen, please clear a path. (applause) - Hello everybody. Thank you so much. (upbeat orchestral music) It's nice to be back home in Chicago. Hello, hi there. Thanks for coming out, it's freezing today. (upbeat orchestral music) (brakes screeching, car crashing) (upbeat orchestral music) - What's up with that? - Absolutely beautiful. Even Dr. Candate enjoyed it. - Nice, very nice. - Thank you. - And he always says the opera is for snobs and fairies. - The ballet, I said that about the ballet. - Excuse me. I need to borrow the woman of the hour for just one moment. - By all means. It was such a pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. - I never said that about the opera. It was the ballet. - Oh, I believe you. Thank you. (whispers) Thank you, darling. - You're welcome. I have some people to see, if you'll excuse me. (laughs) - It was you today, oh my God. - It was you. - You're feeling heavier. - Thank you, thank you. - You look great. It looks wonderful on you. - I know, I know. Bulky is a good look for me, I know it. Come on, sit. - I can't believe this. God, it's been a long time. - I know, I know. Well you look fantastic. You know what? You were just awesome. Man, your voice, it just filled the room, every nook and cranny. - You're so full of shit. - Well, you know, of course I've got a hearing problem, but, (laughs) I still thought it was pretty hot stuff. - I heard that you got married. And, uh, I heard you got divorced. - I've been busy. Are you seeing anyone? - I am. - Yeah. - Yes. You don't know anything about that, huh. - His name is uh-- - Richard Evans. - Right, right, right. - The senator, yeah. - right, right, right, right. And he's the senator of, what's that little speck of a state? - New Hampshire. - It's almost in the water. Right, right, right. You know, that might sink some day, you better be careful with this guy, he might not have a job. (laughs) - Are those for me? - Yes. - Thank you. - They're yours. - Thank you so much. - You can put them along with the rest of the deceased, (laughs) because I should've brought candy. I really should've, because-- - Are you hungry? - Yes. (upbeat Italian music) You cold? - No. - Well your hands are freezing. - They're always freezing. - I remember, the only thing that was colder than your hands were your feet. - (laughs) Oh my God, you used to make me wear socks to bed. - Well my feet were afraid of your feet. - You're such a sick man, you know that? Oh my God, that's more beautiful than I remember it. - We got a lot more buildings now. - Yes, I see. - What? - Nothing. Just glad to see that you're happy. - I seem happy? - Yeah, you do. - To see you maybe. - (laughs) I'm happy to see you too, George. - I can't believe I'm holding these five icy little digits in my hand. (laughs) I think I got a fistful of popsicles. - (laughs) Oh God, you haven't changed a bit. - Now wouldn't that be sad. - You know what I mean. - Yeah. I know. (both speaking French) So what does that mean? - Love is a Bohemian child, he knows no laws. If you don't love me, I love you. And if I love you, watch out for yourself. - Really? - Yeah. - That's some serious French shit. (laughs) - What? - Do you ever? You know, sing? - What, what, that? No, no, no, no, no. - Why, why not? - It's nothing that I consciously don't do, I just don't do it. Can I see you tomorrow? - Sing something for me, just anything. - I don't wanna sing, I'm not gonna sing a song right now. - Please? (whistles) Come on. Just something, anything. (sighs) (sings in Italian) - Oh, you lied, you lied George. I think you do sometimes. - Maybe when I'm all alone in a beautiful theater sitting next to a beautiful woman. But that doesn't happen too often. In fact, this would be the first night. (laughs) You know what happens when you walk away from what should've been? - What? - Nothing. Everything just keeps going. - Meet me at the Blackstone tomorrow morning at 11:00. (drilling) - Hey look, I'm pretty busy right now. - Yeah, I know, I know. I just, you know, what happened back there, it's all in the up and up. - Yes. - I'm not gonna give you my money and see this place on 60 minutes next week. - No, no, no, we run an honest shop here. - Right. You told her what needed to be done, how much it's gonna cost. - Yeah, I told her. I don't think she heard me though. - What do you mean? - She was doing a lot of hollering. - Now what was she hollering about? - She said, "Fix my fucking car. "I need a fucking car." - She said that? - Actually she said, "Fix the fucking car, Gomer." Which goes over really big around here as you can imagine. - Thank you for coming. They see a woman by herself and they take full advantage of her. Can I buy you lunch? - No, I gotta get back. - You're mad. - I'm not mad. - Why are you mad? - I'm not mad. - I'll pay you back for the car. - I don't care about that. - Then what? - Nothing, nothing. Nothing, I got a lot on my mind. - Am I one of the things on your mind. - Yeah, you're on my mind, look, you don't wanna be on my mind. - How do you know what I want? I don't even know what I want. - You want what everybody wants. - What's that? - I don't know, you ask too many questions. I'm not mad, love's not a bus, and a job's not a parachute. If you don't know what you want, maybe you don't want it. - Pardon me. - I'm just saying, you know. - You certainly are. - You're very needy, you know, I don't know if you've ever noticed that. - You think I need you? - Since I bumped into you-- - Oh, bumped into me? - It's been call me, my car, I've got a problem. - Listen, if you don't need me, I don't need you. The only reason I ever wanted you in the least, ever, was because you wanted me and believe me, that was more than half the attraction. If you don't need me, you can kiss my ass. - This is just so stupid, why are we talking to each other this way? - You must've been very lonely the other night, George. I'll pay you back for the car. - You don't have to pay me back. - Fine, then I won't. - Okay, okay, okay! - Mr. Krikkos. - Yeah. - I'm Stuart Aaronson with the hotel. - Hey. - I'm afraid you've missed her. She asked me to personally pass along her apologies to you, as well as this, so you might connect at some point today. - What's this? - That's where she'll be. I'm afraid all times are approximate. - Okay. - Also she asked me to give you this note in her own hand, personally. - A lot of paper. - Indeed, sir. Now is there anything else we can do for you? - No. Thank you. - Very good. How are we? Good. - Did you take your pill? - Yes, I took my pill. - Well you're not doing me any favors. Don't take your pill. Drop dead. That'll teach you. - Hey, I too the pill, woman. - Would you two maybe like to be sitting next to one another, I think that would be-- - Listen, we've been together 53 years. We can be apart for an hour. - 53 years. What's your secret? - Now how the hell do I know? (applause) - Here she comes. - Ladies and gentlemen, we are lucky today to be graced with a most generous appearance by one of our country's most esteemed performers. - Did you have trouble finding this? - Two hospitals and a homeless shelter later. - Sorry. - It's okay. - And perhaps the greatest diva the world has known since Maria Callas. (mic screeching) I can't tell you how excited I am today. I'm sure some of you know that, you know how excited I am about opera. Of course, my mother was the one who introduce me to opera in the living room. All those old records. (laughs) Of course, I wasn't allowed in the living room, so I waited outside and listened very often in the anteroom. - You know, you gave me a sore throat. - Me, me? - Yeah. - You kept me out late last night. - Sorry. - Lucia di Lammermoor, the gown on her wedding night, the blood on the night of her wedding, the blood stained gown. A lovely moment, a gorgeous moment. The trills with the the flutes. (sighs) Let me get back. This is the happiest day of my life since my mother died. So ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, Miss Gina Spenza. (applause, cheering) - Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Oh my goodness. (applause) Thank you very much. Well I must say, I am absolutely pleased to have this opportunity to come by, say hello, and meet some of you. Many of you may know my grandmother was a member of the community here for a number of years. I don't know if any of you knew her. (applause) I visited her often, and I guess you could say I grew quite fond of it here. (applause) Now before I have some punch and visit with some of you, are there any questions I can answer? Yes? - Are you still seeing Senator Evans? (laughs) Yes. (applause) That's funny. That's usually the first question my mother asks me. Any other questions? - Can you sing for us? (applause) - Regrettably, I'm sorry, regrettably, I'm unable to do so. (crowd moans) I'm afraid I woke up with a bit of a scratchy throat after last night's performance. I'm not even sure I'll be able to sing tonight. I tell you what. A very special, and very talented friend of of mine is here today. Perhaps with the proper coaxing, he might favor us with something wonderful. With the proper coaxing. (light applause) - Um, um, thank you. I've always respected my elders. And I loved Cocoon. Did you see that, Jessica Tange, Tandy. Don Ameche, it was a good movie. Okay. (singing opera in Italian) (applause) (cameras clicking) (soft music) - Did you see how much they applauded? - Yeah, well I mean, they were in the mood to clap. Everything you said and did. "I'm happy to be here." Yay! "You're all very old and going to be dead soon." Yay! (laughing) - George, I was very proud of you. - You were? - Weren't you? - Actually, fear is what I remember the most. - Tell the truth. Have you ever felt more wonderful in your entire life? (soft music) - Tell Vickie when she puts together the pictures not to tape them together. I don't have copies of these pictures yet. - We don't have to do the pictures. - I wanna do the pictures, I'm just saying. Have you gotten a good response for the party? - Yes, everybody's coming. Friends, family, heads of state. - Heads of state should come, you know how many years your father has worked for this party, right? - Right. - Did you hear from Jilly? - No. - Nothing? - Nothing. - You didn't call her. - I told you it was a bad idea. - I'm gonna call her myself. - Fine, call her. - This is your father's retirement party. She was one of your father's favorites. - You're asking for trouble. - She's family. What do you want? Ask me, I'll pass it to you. There's a human being sitting here. - Thank you. - They're divorced. - I don't recognize that. - You didn't recognize their marriage either. - I did. - Only after Andy was born. - Your brother never recognized it, that was the trouble. He left his hide somewhere else, everybody knows that. - Are we gonna hear this again? - Am I wrong? He was never the same. Everything always came too easy to your brother. That's his curse. First thing doesn't go his way, he dies. - That's ancient history. - So what? He's dead. You die, what good are you then? What do you want? - I don't know. - (sighs) She's here, you know. Who's where? She's here in town to sing. It was on the TV. - So what. - Exactly, so what. Poor Jilly. I always said that. He married her because he had to. That's no way to start a marriage. - What does it matter now? She's gonna be married to someone else in a week. - I don't recognize that either. (sighs) I'm gonna call her. - Are you listening to this? - Are you kidding? (soft music) - (grunts) What are you doing? - (laughs) Nothing. - You're looking at me. - Was I? You just look kinda cute when you're sleeping, that's all. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'm awake now. - Oh well. - What time is it? - 7:30. Shouldn't you be at work right about now? - You know what? Don't bullshit me. Because I know where you are. You're with her. (truck honks) You know who. It's in all the papers. No, literally. It's in all the papers. - Hey, you're famous. (upbeat orchestral music) (knocking) - Yo! (upbeat orchestral music) - I hate you. - So don't read it, honey. That's why I never read the paper, nothing but bad news. (upbeat orchestral music) Hey, have you seen my socks? (laughing) - Opera great, Gina Spenza, the long time love interest of Senator Richard Evans of New Hampshire, was seen this week in her hometown of Chicago with a new protege. Let's just say that the two are old friends. - Old friends. Sounds like trouble. - Sure does. (laughing) (upbeat orchestral music) - I don't like it. - What don't you like? - It's exploitative and manipulative. - And inspirational and heartwarming. We're giving this guy a second chance at a dream that he'd long abandoned. - A dream of what? Of being a dancing bear in some opera house side show? - (laughs) That's a very jaundiced perspective. - Jaundiced? - What do you think? - I think it would be a disaster, both personally and professionally. - (sighs) We know what you think, Lil. I'm asking her. - I don't even know if this is gonna be something he's gonna wanna do. - It's ludicrous, my God, he's not a professional singer. He's barely an amateur. - She's right. He hasn't sung in years. - He did it on a moment's notice before. Couldn't you do a little spaghetti opera, just a little crowd pleaser to play off of that episode yesterday? We'll so something bigger later in the tour. People will love it. - They'll hate it. - Oh Christ, the purists will hate it. The purists hate everything. One of your greatest talents has been to take the music to a broader audience, to make people feel less intimidated by it. They start out loving you, then they grow to love the opera. That's your gift. Who knows, maybe it's his gift too. (country music) - Did you want sprinkles with that? - Yes. - Bunny, or celebration? - Celebration. (ketchup sputters) - Oh, oh, that was daddy. That was your dad. Can you eat all that? - Yeah. - If you make yourself sick, I'll get in trouble. - How come your picture was in the newspaper? - Did you see that? - You were with a lady. - Yeah, she's an old friend of mine. - Is she your girlfriend. - No, not really, no. - You could have girlfriend though. - I could. I could. - Like mom has Ed. - Right. Like mom and Ed. - Are you gonna be at their wedding? - Nah, no, no. - Why not? - Well it's really a, you know I was married to your mom, and this is really their day. It's on Sunday, right? - Right. - You get to wear a monkey suit, don't ya? - Then I'll have two dads. - Just lick it from your elbow up, son. That's it, that a boy. (soft music) This guy's a pain in the ass. He calls me day and night. - I don't mind, I don't mind. - Night and day, I need this. - George, this is like an adventure for me, I don't mind. - Okay. You're not afraid of rats or anything? - Don't be funny. - Well you're not wearing an open toed shoe, you'll be okay. This is it. This is where I've wasted a life. - Don't say it like that. - You predicted it. - I did not. - Yeah, come on, all the grief that you gave me. - Grief? No, no, no, no, I did not give you grief. All I said was, you just gotta do what you've gotta do, that's what I said. - Do what you gotta do. - Yeah. - I don't remember that. I remember specifically, "This is the place where things come "when they stop growing." (soft music) - You remember every rotten thing I ever said, didn't you. - I remember everything. - I hate that. - I know, come on, let's get to work. - So what's gonna happen tomorrow, how's it work? - Well, tomorrow we pass the baton to the Gumba boys, and my father and brother, those are good, make like Garner and McQueen in The Great Escape. - It's gonna be hard for ya, huh? - I haven't given it much thought, that's all right. Couple more. Okay. Hmm. - What are you doing? - Trying to see if these will fit up his ass. (lighthearted music) - Oh, I love this. What do you call this? - The wailing wall. - The wailing wall? - Yeah, for wailing. I have a lot of anger, you know, that's why I come up here. - Whoa. - You have a beer, you throw a few. Nobody gets hurt. It's like a vegetarian temper tantrum. - Oh, it's kinda like singing. You know sometimes when I sing it's almost as if all the demons are rushing out of me, like fire out of a dragon. - Like that. - Yeah, you'd probably have a little less anger if you were singing some, you know? Would you ever consider that? - What, like in the men's choir in church or something? - Yeah. Maybe professionally. - I think it's a little late for that. - You know, George, I'd help however I could. - Yeah, like how? - Like giving you the opportunity. - What kind of opportunity? - Like the other day. - That was a joke. - That wasn't a joke. - That was a joke, that was just silliness. - (sighs) You know there's actually been a little talk of you joining me onstage sometime during the tour. - People are talking, people are talking? - I'm not saying you should, but you know, if you were, thought you might like to, we're kinda thinking maybe-- - I don't think I want to. - Okay. And there you go. - What? - (sighs) Okay, what happens when you walk away from something that should've been? - Nothing. - Does that seem right? - Look, when I said that, I wasn't talking about the opera. Okay? Throw your tomato. You're doing great. You're the prettiest one that's ever been on that. - Thanks George. - Slow it down a little now. Lower it down. Lower it down. Lower it down, you're doing fantastic. That's it! - Woo hoo! - That's it, I mean, now bring it on home. Come home, bring it on home. - I've always wanted to drive one of these, George. - I'm your dream weaver, I'm making all your dreams come true, right, right? - Okay, so give me something else to do. - Marry me! - What? - Brake, brake, brake. Marry me? - What? - You could keep the truck. (soft music) - What's the matter? - My stomach. - You're probably just worked up about tomorrow. (soft music) Come here. Come on, lay down here. There. I'll rub your stomach. - Don't start no bolognas now. - I'm not gonna start any bolognas. (soft music) You're gonna miss it, aren't ya? - I don't know. I don't know. - Sure ya are. - You can talk about it. (soft music) What are you gonna miss the most? - Nothing I don't miss already. (soft music) - You done good, Deany. You both did. You built a beautiful business here. And I swear on my mother's grave, we'll do right by it. - That's good to know, Sal. - You know we will. We know if we don't you're little brother here will kick our asses, right? He won't let us fuck it up, will ya Georgie? - That's right Sal, I'll kick your asses if you do. - See what I told ya? That's why I'm glad he's staying. He'll keep us honest. - George is a big celebrity now. - Yeah, what's that about, George? - She a screamer, George? That'd be something if she was, huh? Mm, knock you right outta that bed. - Take it easy, Joey, he'll kick your ass before we get outta the box. - George knows I'm kidding. - Hey, where's your father? - He's on his farewell tour. He'll be around later. - All right, well these are poured, so we'll have one now, and one later with papa. - Yeah, you can't walk on one leg. - Absolutely. George. To the Krikkos boys. George, it's good to have you aboard. Let's kick a little ass together. And Dean. Takes a lot of balls to do what you're doing. I always thought Joey and me had the biggest balls in the world, but you, you got some big ones too. - Thank you. - Salud. - So where do you guys buy your pants? (laughing) - Where do you buy your pants? (laughs) - Son of a bitch. (laughing) - Get out of the way, make way, make way. (applause, cheering) - You lucky son of a bitch, you. - You're goddamn right. - We'll save you a seat at the card table. - Make sure it's close to the wash room, I'm an old man. - Okay, old man. - Hey Dean, you leaving too? - No, I'm just helping him out. I got a few more things. - All right come on, get back to loafing and gambling, guys. - All right, any last words for the boys on the line, sir? - It's been good to know you, but the past is the past. Until we meet again on a new day, you can all kiss my ass. (laughing) - Where'd you get that? - I made it up. I can make things up. (festive music) - No, no, not yet. How are you, huh? (festive music) - Georgie, come on over here a minute. - All right. - This opera singer. This is the girl you used to go with? - Yeah, I went with her a long time ago, yeah. - I remember when you went with her. - Do ya? That's great that you remember. I mean, at your ages, you'd think the memory would be the first thing to go. - I wish the memory was the first to go. - I forgot you could sing. - I forgot too. - You should go onto Star Search, a lot of people got started on that show? - Like who? - Like that one kid. The comedian. What the hell was his name? - Seinfeld? - No, he's a colored kid. - Eddie Murphy. - Popeye. - Sinbad. - Sinbad. I knew it was some frickin' sailor. You should go on that show. - I don't think that show's still on. - Well I think it is. - I think those are repeats. - I don't think so. - Hey, isn't that your little boy over there? - Hi grandma. - Yeah. - Hi mom. How are ya? - Boy, he's sure getting big. - Isn't he though? Excuse me a minute, guys. - With Ed McMahon. - I know the show. - Hey Mongoose, give me a hug. Give me a hug. You're not too big for hugs, are ya? - No. - Atta boy. - Mom says I have to hug everybody. - She's right. You gotta watch your wallet in this crowd though, you know. - Uh, dad, I don't have a wallet. - Grandma wants to show you something in the kitchen. - Where you going, where you taking him? - To the kitchen. - Going to the kitchen. - Yeah. - I didn't know you were coming. - Nobody told you, huh. - That's okay. - Your mom called. - It's a nice surprise. - Oh good. (clears throat) - So uh, where's the Ed. - They are throwing a bachelor party for him. Yeah, I don't even wanna think about it. So what was yours like? - Mine? Cards, and cigars. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Any girls there? - What did I tell you then? - I don't remember. - I don't remember either. - Oh well. - Oh well. - Doesn't matter now. - No, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. - Yeah. So, saw you in the papers. - Yeah. I was there. - She coming tonight, or? - No, she's working. - Performing. - Right, you know she-- - Right. - Does that. - You son of a bitch. You never said anything. - Yeah, I know. I don't know. - You know what's so unbelievable? - What? - I didn't even know you could sing. - Georgio! (laughs) (crowd chatter) - How do you not invite the new owners? - You just don't. There's no how, you just do or not. - It would be a snub. - But what about the snub to me, I mean I don't even get consulted. - Well if anybody thought you gave a damn about anything. - Nobody tells me Jilly's coming. - That's the old lady. There's no stopping the old lady. She's still trying to save your marriage. - The old man hates these guys. - Yeah, well, they kinda paid for the party. - Well that's kind of a stretch. - Look, it's one night. - It's one night for you, maybe, I gotta live with these guys every day now. - Now who's fault is that? - You know, I knew you were gonna say that, I knew it, let's talk about that, okay? - Okay, let's. - Who's fault do you think it is? - I know who's fault it is. There's only one man who's fault it could be. - You wanna know how I got into this mess? - How? - You begged me. - I begged you? - Yeah, you begged me. Georgie, Georgie, please come back, the old man needs you, Georgie. - Oh, that's not me. - It isn't? - I don't call you Georgie. - You needed me and I came. - You didn't need us? - You needed me, and I came. - And I'm eternally grateful. What would you have done otherwise? - God only knows. - Think about that a lot, do you George? - Lately. - A lot easier than having done it, isn't it? - Carry this shit up yourself. - Well which is it? Are you hurt, or embarrassed? (soft music) Well, you know what I think is that you're a little more embarrassed than you are hurt. That's what I, that's how I feel. I'm not doing anything, Richard. Oh, okay, I'll grant you that. I'm doing something, but you're definitely blowing it out of proportion. Yes, you are. (sighs) Look Richard, (sighs) I think we both knew that something was about to happen. Well this is it. This is what happened. (soft music) - He needs someone to be mad at. - Why? Why does he need that? - Because he's a big kid. - Do you think I'm selfish? - No, you're not, everybody's a little bit selfish. - So I am selfish. - Deano. Everyone has got to look out for themselves, now you are not responsible for someone else's happiness. (soft music) - Having fun? - Yeah. And you? - Yeah. It's a nice party. - I've got a little favor to ask you. After you go on ahead and marry the Ed. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. - What's Andy gonna call him? - What do you want him to call him? - Well what's he call him now? - He calls him Ed. - Well that's good. Uncle Ed, or Mr. Ed, I think would be my absolute number one. - I get it, George. - He's the one, right? - Yeah, he's the one. - How do you know he's the one? - What do you mean? - Well I'm just curious, I mean what is it about him that makes him the one? - Are you jealous? - No, I'm not jealous. I'm happy for you. I'm happy for you, really. I just wanna know what it is that would make him the one. - I just know. - Well, you thought I was the one. - Yeah. - But you were wrong. - No, I wasn't. You were. (opera music) (knocks) (knocks) - Yeah. (sighs) Did you uh, forget your pitch pipe? I trust you know who I am. - Yeah, I know, you're Senator Richard Hertz. - Senator Richard Evans. - Oh, I'm sorry. Well then, well then, who's Dick Hertz? - (laughs) Well, you sing, you tell jokes. Do you dance as well? - Are you asking? - I oughta punch you in the mouth. - I thought you were a politician. You don't punch, you run. (laughs) - Wonderful, I see you two have met. - Yeah, he's already asked me to dance. - I think it's time for you to go now. - Why don't we just put that to a vote. - Please just go inside, Richard. - I don't care to go inside. - Well super, why don't you come on out here and then I'll go inside. - Inside, Richard. Please. - Make it quick. - He's pretty tough for a Democrat, huh? - He surprised me. I tried to call you. - Well here I am. - I tried to call and ask you not to come. - Why didn't you call him and ask him not to come? - George, I didn't know he was coming. - Well then so go ahead and ask him to leave. - I can't do that right now. - Well why not? - (sighs) Normally I'm the first person to tell him where to go but-- - But, but, but, what, what? - George, I don't know what to say. It was really nice, it was so nice, I can't tell you-- - Nice? Nice? It was nice? - I'm sorry, that's not what I was trying to say. - Yeah, well look, I'm sorry too, if it was first come first served I could've been here hours ago. - Don't do that. - What about me? - (scoffs) What about you? You show up 15 years later and I'm supposed to know what to do with you? George, you don't even know what to do with you. - I asked you to marry me. - Keep it down. - (whispers) I asked you to marry me. - Well you knew I was involved with somebody. - Involved, what does that mean, involved? - Involved, George, you know what it is to be involved. - No, no, it sounds very clinical to me. George doesn't get it, I don't know. - Going steady, is that better? - Steady? Steady, you know where steady is? Steady is like somewhere down here. I asked you to marry me, that's like way up there. - So did he. - What? What kind of a hotel is this? My God, everybody's got a key to your room. I mean, I just don't understand what you're thinking about. I just don't get it. I mean, listen, don't you know I'm the guy? - George. - You know what I mean. That look that I saw on your face the other day when you were driving by in your car, that look, that fear. - Fear? - You know I'm the guy. You can't help it, it's a scary thing. It's okay, it's okay to be a little bit afraid, that's just the way it is. - George, I can't do this anymore. - Well why not? - I don't know. I'm confused. - Confused, shit. You haven't been confused a day in your life. You wouldn't allow yourself to be confused, it might distract you from your focus. - I am not gonna stand here and be belittled for having my life in order. - (scoffs) In order. You don't have a life, you've got an itinerary. - God, what do you have, George? - I wanna sing tonight. (scoffs) Yeah, yeah, tonight. (laughs) - Oh, you're a piece of work. You wanna sing tonight. No preparations, no rehearsals. (laughs) - It'll be a triumph for the undisciplined. - Fine, I won't stand in your way. - Good, good. Great, great, good. - Meet me at the auditorium at 6:00 then, okay? - All right, yeah, no, I'm there. - Great, you having second thoughts? - No. - Did I call your bluff? - Yeah. - Great, I'll see you at 6:00. - But it's okay. - I'll see you at 6:00. - Okay. (knocks) - Oh, uh, senator, you know about that pitch pipe, I believe it's under the bed. Fuck. (singing) Well, you've all paid a lot of money to be here. And we're not gonna disappoint them, are we? That's this, I'm gonna do this, all right, I can do this tonight, okay. I don't know if I can do this tonight. (quietly singing) (singing opera music) - (sighs) Do I have to choose? - No. - Great. (singing opera music) Thank you. - You're welcome. (singing opera music) She'll be introducing you after this. - All right, I know, I know. - Okay. (singing opera music) - You're not big on this, are ya? - On your performing? No, I'm not big on it. Love the opera. Hate the circus. I wish you well though. (applause) - Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I have a special treat for you tonight. A dear friend of mine who hails from Chicago is here, and he'd like to sing a special selection for you. Now if you'd all join me in welcoming him to the stage, Mr. George Krikkos. (applause) - Break a leg. (applause) (piano playing) (singing opera music) (faltering) - George. - Matt. - Excuse me, I think I broke a vein in my head, I gotta wait. Okay. (laughter) This is Matt, the accompaniment. We just met. Which I'm sure was the problem. So I'm gonna try it again. Sorry about that. It should be okay now. Go from wherever. (plays piano, repeating music) I wanna apologize. I know you all came to hear a show. I don't wanna keep you from that in any way. So, I apologize. I'm sorry. Thank you. (light applause) You're angry. - Aren't you the one who wanted to sing? - Yeah. - So why did you stop? - What would you have done? - Finished what I started. - I tried. - What did you think would happen? - Well I don't know. If you knew, why'd you let me do it? - What did you want me to do, save you from yourself? - That would've been nice. - That's all you ever want, isn't it? Everybody should always act in your best interest. (sighs) You know what's really funny? They were 100% behind you. - Who? - The audience. - I don't care about them, I did it for you. - (scoffs) Oh, that was for me. George, I forgot to thank you. - Look, I'm gonna go. - Fine, go. - Fine. (laughs) (door slams) For 15 fuckin' years I've been playing can you top this with the memory of you. You know what? I can't. I just can't. You don't have the decency to go away. You're everywhere. Everywhere. You're on TV, you're on magazines, you're on posters, you're on a hundred posters that cry out to me loud when I'm walking on the street just minding my own business. Why don't I haunt you? Now, it's been nice, right? Very nice. I mean, you got what you wanted, didn't you? Got the senator to step up to the altar just a little bit quicker.

You should never forgive me for what I did. - Then why are you apologizing? - Because I'm sorry, all right? - I mean I feel like we're reenacting the breakup of Abbot and Costello. You wanna just tell me what's on your mind? - I, I think it'd be better for everybody involved if I didn't. - Well then why did you bring it up?

Why Al? - Why anybody? - You could do better. - Says who? I hate this quiet, you're not even eating anything either. - I'm not hungry. - Then why did we order all this food? - I thought you were hungry. - Well I'm not hungry enough for the both of us. - More coffee? - No, that's all right, just the check when you get a chance. - Shall I wrap some of this up for you? - Yeah. - No, thank you. - It's no trouble. - No thank you, just the check. - Why didn't you let her wrap it up? - It's breakfast, you can't reheat breakfast.

Treated me like a queen. My mom said he was too good to me and he never stood a chance. But when you're young, you like a challenge, right? I don't think I'll be seeing you for a while. - Yeah, I kinda got the same feeling. - Will you do me a favor? - Anything. - Miss me. (soft music) (opera music) (phone rings) - Thank you for calling the Blackstone Hotel, this is Stuart, how may I help you? - Stuart, thank God it's you. If anybody can help me, it's you Stuart. Listen, Miss Spenza, do you know where they went? - Yes, Mr. Krikkos. I'm afraid you've just missed her, they checked out moments ago. - Do you know where they are now? - I believe they're departing out of Union Station. - Great, great, thanks pal. (upbeat orchestral music) (upbeat opera music) - What's your name? Leila. Did you like the performance last night? Here you go. (singing opera music) - Oh my God. (singing opera music) - It's time to go. (singing opera music) The guy is a fucking lunatic. (singing opera music) (applause) (alarm clock buzzing) - Look at this. They sent us a fruit basket. What the hell kind of a moron would send a fruit basket to a produce company? - Maybe it's a joke. - What kinda joke? - We're a produce company. That's a fruit basket. You get it? - No. - How's it going so far? - It's great. - Must be weird. - Not at all. - What do they seem like? - Great guys. - We've lost him. (phone ringing) - [Marty] This is Marty.
