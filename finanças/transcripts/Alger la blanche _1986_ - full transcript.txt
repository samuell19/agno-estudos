Respect them. Leave. Give us time to survive this tragedy. What are you looking at ? I'm talking to you ! I'm Farid's cousin. So what ? So... I don't like you. You're here but you're... You're looking at me. White... I don't want you here. Somewhere else it would be ok. But not here. Ok ? Got it ? Hey ? What's wrong with him ? Stop it ! - Listen Hassan, I'm your cousin. - He's not your brother. - Hassan, I'm your cousin. It's for your good. - Stop it now. Calm down. I told him 11:00. We arrived at 11:15 because his fucking car broke down. Farid is dead but... It's over now. Listen to me. We must know why he died. Why is he dead ? It would be of no use. No use. What are you going to do ? Calm down. - Come here. - See your sister ? See her ? Do you see her ? I saw her yesterday. She's going out, isn't she ? - Sit down. - No, I want to know. Sit down here. Now calm down. It's over. He was reckless. He was reckless and now... He was reckless. Calm down. Now we must find the reason of Farid's death. Get some fresh air. Everyone is asking questions. Your father, your family... People don't get it. I know that. Calm down now. You're going out and you see nothing. Don't start it again ! - He's crazy. - Don't start again. Sit down ! - Stop now. - He doesn't care about the family. Look. Look at your sister, look. You, look at me. You did as you wanted with Farid. Now, for Nahed... And the family... Leave them. - Don't touch her. - I don't want your sister. - You don't want to touch her ? She's not my sister but my cousin. - So you like boys ? - It's none of your business. Hey, you're not my father. You're blaming everyone because... because... He's a prostitute. It has nothing to do with you. He does what he wants with his life. Stay calm. - Come here ! - Stop it ! Come here, you faggot ! - It's our family. - Forget it. What do you want me to forget ? - It's our family's pride. - The police will investigate. This guy... We've contacted the embassy. Sit down. Enough. Go out now. Get out of here. Get out of here. Look at me. Sit down. Have a sit. It's not our house anymore. You don't respect anything. - I do respect. - No ! No ! There are the neighbors and the others. Aren't you ashamed ? But his sister... Enough. Stop it now. Since Farid's death... He's never been here and he attacks me. I'm his cousin ! Fighting... You should be ashamed. Nahed, follow Farid's path and you'll know the same ending. Go ahead, you'll have troubles. The parking, the underground, the drugs... Stop it. It's my problem. Leave me alone. I didn't talk to you. Everyone calm down now, ok ? It's not the moment for that. Hassan ! - Where are you going. - Go home Mohammed. Don't embarrass me. You're going with them ? Where are you going ? I'm going with Hassan. Hassan. Is it true that Farid committed suicide ? You knew my brother ? Who are you ? Keep cool. It's fine. - Where are you going ? - To the police. - Where ? - To the police. How did my brother die ? - I don't know him. - It's Farid . You know him, tell us. Who killed him ? Don't pretend. You must know. Tell us. Go get your boss. Now, hurry. Farid was lucky. Really ? He told me everything. So ? So... My family wants to marry me with a rich man. Farid was lucky to fuck with a man like you. We should take care of each other. I want you. Now. No. Why ? You did it with my brother. - It's different ? - What's different ? You're his sister. Did you love him ? Would you have been together forever ? Maybe. Don't dream. He wouldn't have stayed with you. I don't know. I do. He was just having pleasure. Better not come back. I'll go there like a coward. I have no plan. Nothing concrete. Farid used to say : "Alger the White".
