Is that him? Yes, it's him. They will no longer seek justice. God will forgive me. How can I thank you, cousin? You would have done it for me. Go! Wait… I don't see what I'm owed. And my man is dead… Everything should have ended two nights ago. Is there dignity in refusing to fight for those you love? And paying those who do poorly? Thank you! Put it on the floor! What is made of chain and is dust in the wind? Behind the shed, as always… I often made this mistake when younger, when I was left at home. How will it be? Believe me, it will be like last night. It will be beautiful! Hasn't it always been beautiful? I'll change the border, it will be higher. That's good! If the rain lasts longer the sage must not stay more than two days in the mud. No more than three days outside, I know. Never forget God! Everything is in nature. -And God is nature. -”God is nature,” I know. It's father Gilles. He wants sulphur for his skin. Love your wife… Keep your secrets for your children. If one day you see your brother… Thank him for leaving. I would have liked running my hand through his hair. The heart is here! In nomine patri, et fili, et spiritus sancti. Amen. Your mother was a good woman. It's clear that I'm still alive because she cured me of this terrible disease that ate at my belly. I know. Did you know she always thanked God for giving her the gift of healing with plants? Why not bury her in the cemetery, near the church? My mother wanted to rest near her twins. I understand. I should have cut them earlier. I didn't dare to do it. The rain was too strong. It hasn't been a good year. Nobody ever comes from that side. Are you Cantien's son? We have come to see your mother. She's dead. Never any luck. We were told she knew secret potions that cure disease. Plants are our only medicine. Is that so? Thirty miles from here we saw a healer who heals by touch and having the sick drink the liquids of animals. He didn't survive. The healer, I mean. And you… Did your mother pass down her secrets on you? How high is his fever? He has the "lover's sickness," his loins burn like fire. I can calm his fever, not his penis. Heal him. We'll pay you. Go to the barn, children. Hurry! Don't turn your back on me. I want to see what you're doing. I'm only mixing herbs. That's all I have left. One teaspoon, twice a day, when you rise and when you go to sleep. If the fever does not break in a week, go see a doctor in Toulouse. To cut it off? Toulouse is six days on horseback. He would die on the road. If your medicine doesn't heal him… I will be back. Pay him. I promised to pay and now I have. No one ever said it would be money. Ah! No! Shh… You scream again and I will stab you. There. Please leave me alone. You with your limb, me with my hump, we are the same, right? Just want to know how a lame girl is like. So come on. Lift it. Hilde! Hilde! Hilde! Leave him be. Mom, come! Come! What is it? Go outside. Arnaud! Arnaud, you slept three days and three nights. Arnaud! Arnaud? Arnaud, where are you going? There is no road here. Arnaud! You said you'd pay in spring. We already paid for one. It doesn't matter. I sold you two goats, one hasn't been paid for. I'm taking back both. Where is the other? Dead. It was sick when you sold it to us. She was fine. Where is Arnaud? Is he hiding? Spring also includes the end of spring. We will pay you with hay. Don't try my patience with riddles about the start and end of spring. Spring is spring! Your mother paid for that one, didn't she? I'll be back. This won't stand. Arnaud? The soup is by the fire. I made bread. I'll be back soon. Let's go. Look at the pigs! So many! You want to know what this is? That's for you. -Arnaud made it just before… -Don't trouble yourself. I'll feed your kids. Your husband helped me, and I will help you as well. That's what God would want. Is your cousin's house far from here? Beyond the river. He lives alone ever since his parents died. -Do you know him? -No. But I need him. Who are you? Guillemette, Arnaud's wife. They say you know his brother, Thomas. And if I do? His mother is dead and his brother is sick. Would you be able to find him? We fought in the same campaigns. But I only saw him around. Do you know you can't trust a crooked arrow? Why do you say that? Thomas kidnapped a woman and her child and killed them. Anyway, this is what we say in Toulouse. It's not there that you have to look for him. You are right, he could be anywhere. It could take many days to find him. I know. Take this. It’s not enough. This is all I have. It's not. You also have this. Take the money! I have a malformed leg. Surely a lame girl is not proper for you. Finding a man like Thomas is no easy task, and I demand payment upfront. I'm looking for a man called Thomas. Thomas. A man with a scar? A bit like mine, but in a better position? Yes, that's right. I don't want your goat, she made the others sick. Yes I remember him because he asked me to watch his horse. It's eating up all of my oats! If he isn't back in a month his horse is mine, naturally. Naturally. If he returns one day… tell him his mother is dead and his brother needs him. If he ever comes back to pay up, I will. Hey there, blacksmiths! Finished with your work? My little warrior is waiting! No, that won't do it! Wait for me. Am I wrong? That's me. I've heard you're a good archer. Is that true? It is. Do you see that woman over there? Her husband was kidnapped near the castle, not far from here. By brigands. I don't know much about the place, but if you help me find him, we’ll split the reward. Fifty-fifty, plus food and feed for my horse. Still in pain? Yes, I need your mother's medicine. Call Arnaud. -He's not here. -Where is he? I don't know. I'll make you an infusion. That should help. Some bandits were here, they beat him up. He doesn't recognize me since that day. Guillemette told me you're ill. That you don't remember anything. Did you also lose your voice? Or you just don't wish to talk? Ha. Are you looking at my coif? I had just arrived in the village when I baptized you. You pissed on me. Later, I… I married you and Guillemette. Where are your children? -I put them in another's care. -You did well. And Arnaud? What are you looking for? Oak leaves. What for? An infusion. I am Thomas. I'm Guillemette. Arnaud's wife. Go inside. It's me, Thomas. Your brother. You shot me with my crossbow when I tried to take it from you. Here. I told the nanny's daughter… to show you her rear. You remember? Have you seen Arnaud? Not since the evening. Do you have wine? On the table. The soup is good. Tastes the same as mother's. She taught me how to cook. But taught me nothing about medicines. Old women don't like a pretty daughter-in-law. What are you going to do if his memory doesn't come back? I thought you knew, but you don't. I never learned medicine. I leave tomorrow. Take the alcohol if you want. It's in the barn. Don't let her get away. Come on, just grab it! Got a good hold on it? Put it on the mule. What are you doing? Didn't we say the end of spring? That's what you said. I said the beginning of spring. What happens in spring? Spring? It's spring now, so… she owes me a goat. We paid for the one that died, the other was to be paid for when the wheat matures. How much is the goat? -The price? -How much? Ten crowns. This is five. The rest at the end of spring. Then I'll return the goat on the first day of summer. No. I know what they owe me, everything is written here. Is it worth dying for a goat? You'll go outlaw for five crowns? I'm the one being scammed. Thomas! I will kill you if you cut me. Five crowns. First day of summer. Thank you. Have you seen this? I thought these only existed in churches. So? So if the merchant has books maybe other books can be found too. Books to cure illness. Mother never had books. She learned all what she knew from father. Still, what if such a book exists? Then it belongs to the powerful, to the learned. Do you know how to read? You're leaving, Thomas. And you leave me alone with Arnaud who doesn’t even remember his name. They say there are places like here, where people treat diseases with herbs. Maybe they have books. What are you eating? Do you want to become a horse? You stink, brother. He is Hebrew, this one. Mother liked to do this. She loved you. Cheese from the goat. And bread for the road. You are right, maybe there are some books. I don't know where they would be. I'll help you find them. We'll leave tomorrow. But I won't come back here, you return alone. Use this. It's better than straw. There's food there if you're hungry. If you are thirsty, here. Your wife will be back in a few days. I will lock you inside to protect you. Goodbye, brother. Hold tight. Oh, no. Get out. This is my house. Here are the five crowns for the second goat. Ah. Good. That's good, paying off debts. God will return it to you. I will give this back as well. If you help us. Two days ride to the south, you'll find the Arc Monastery. Here is the Morrie Abbey. Ah. This leads to a cleric's castle, the lord of which is a man of learning. No, everything burned there. How do you know? I was there. Were there any books? Then there's Abbey of Celian. It is said that the monks there heal with plants. I don't know if they put that knowledge into books. If not, a bit further… The Abbey of Beaulieux. There are nuns there. What does this say? I can't read noble letters but I can read numbers. Good morning. -We have come far and… -What do you want? We seek a book. Our order does not write books. We've been told that we may find here the remedies for… Nobody speaks about diseases here. And none shall enter. But… Can I ask you something? Mm. Why did you leave? All those years ago. Father died. The twins ate food enough for four, and mother couldn't take it anymore. Someone had to go. Your knife is beautiful. It's a woman's knife. Do you want it? Was it made in Toulouse? Yes. How do you know that? Tell me. How did you know? There's a story about you in Toulouse… but it is not pretty. Not pretty? Then forget about it. What are you doing here, hiding? My brother is better but I need more medicine. Give us what we came for. Are you stupid or deaf? Let's go. Look. You've finally found a lover. So you're also in love, then. I don't like the simple-minded. You never know if it's God or the devil that lives in them. Good morning. Can we see the Abbess? Does she expect you? We've come to see her. That doesn't mean anything. We must see her. On the right. Find some oats for their horses. The Abbess is busy, you know. I can't promise you anything. Now you'll have to wait. The hostelry are just behind you. What are you doing? My feet hurt. You should do the same. I am told there are some who ask to see the Abbess. Yes. It's important. Why? It's a long story. You wouldn't want to hear it all. Come when you're ready. For the book. And her husband learned how to heal from our mother, using plants. But our mother died. My brother, now very ill, can no longer pass on what he knows. I find myself powerless to relieve the sick who come to see us. The simple people owe their virtues only the hand of God. The mission of the church is to ensure that these works do not leave God's house. Please understand that I can't help you. God always requires assistance in helping the poorest. I am sure you are a good woman. I believe you need this money more than we do. It doesn't stand its chance. What was the name of your husband's mother? …Marie. Marie Boisset. Mirand's village. I will have a mass held to pray for her soul. Bring them to the garden. Choose your missing plants. Sending you away empty-handed would trouble my conscience. It must have been a long road. You can spend the night at the hostelry. Goodbye, my children. This way, please follow me. Tell us which plants you would like. I will look around, thank you. See? They have everything here. Why didn't you reveal your mother's name? You'll find out tonight. Thomas. It's beautiful, if only I knew how to read. Thank you. I can see my children again soon. Will you give back the gold crown? I left it at the hostelry, for the book. I'll drop you off at the market. Do you know someone there who can take care of you? I know the couple who sells spices. They will take me in. And you, where are you going? Where the fighting is. That's all you live for. That's all I can do. Thomas. The man over there. The big one with the beard, he's one of the men that beat your brother. You mean the brigand there? I know for sure that he's one of them. Get me home. How did you get out of the barn? It’s all a mess here, did you do that? Get out. Are you going to help me? I don’t want to shake. He's dying. He's sleeping. See? Yes, he is. I told you. Do you doubt me? It's by the grace of God that life triumphs over death. We came so fast. May I have something to drink, Guillemette? Your spring water is good. I saw Arnaud in the garden. How is he? A bit better. I prayed for him. Is he recovering? I hope so. What is that? -A book. -Yes, I can see that! These are simple remedies. Where did you get this? From an abbey far from here. I don’t want to know how you got the book, but I do know it must not stay here. Besides, you can’t read. It's of no use to you. I already know a few letters. If you teach me how to read, I can cure diseases and support my family. Don't sully yourself, Guillemette. You have a good reputation. Sell your vegetables, go to another farm. But I don't want to live on another farm! I want to live here, with knowledge of medicine. Anything God wants to grow here, grows. Mother Cantien cultivated this area as a humble servant of the church. Never forget. The book. Thomas gave his last penny for it. What do I tell him when he awakes? Tell him what he already knows. That a book's place is not on a farm, but in God's house. You’d know that if you came more often. Stable the horses. Merchant! A few days ago, a friend of ours came to buy flour. Have you seen him? Flour? I sell flour every single day. A big guy, with a white horse. -Ah, that one. -Right, that one. He's dead. What? Killed, over there. By who, and how? Who? It was a crossbowman who got him. A crossbowman? Do you know his name? He was with a lame girl, that's all I know. Was she old or young? Young. I heard they live in Orteloux. -Wait. -That was my partner! Sell me some flour. -Give me… -Leave it. I can see better than you. Looks good. Your wound. It looks good. I can finally go out. And you, aren't you bored every day? When I thought you would die… The priest came to give you the last rites. He saw the book and took it. Men of god are all the same. They think only they know what is right. Maybe he doesn't trust you after mother's death. He wants to be needed. And there's your disfigurement. If you could read… he would lose his purpose here. You must be right. There are rumors that you are a murderer. One day, a woman in Toulouse… She's the one you killed? I never killed any woman. But the gossip still lives. That's why I could never return. I know what you mean. I want to go outside. Bring Arnaud in! Lock the horses in the barn, quick. -Why? -Quickly! Arnaud! Arnaud. Hurry, we have to go inside. Come. Thomas? Thomas. A dog. We need a dog. A barking dog. Okay. They'll return. I don't know when, but they will return. The villagers told me that the warriors' wives had been attacked. People are gonna get scared about a lot of things. Right. Nobody ever comes from that direction. Come sit here. Sit. Walk a bit. Try. Does it hurt? A little, here. You think it’s them? No. They won't attack on a bright night. An animal scared him. Here. Wear it every day. Thank you. Go to bed. This mushroom was drawn very well in the book. There were three drawings of it. Arnaud and his mother used it for leg pain. I don't know how to make it. It smells good. Here. I'm done. Why are you laughing? Because if Arnaud is next, everyone in this house will be limping. The dog must not be in the house. It's this rain that makes everything dirty. I took the opportunity to work at the garden. Where is Arnaud? I don't know. You're acting like a dog, it's a grave! Thomas. Thomas, stop! Thomas! -What is this, are you crazy? -He’s the one who’s crazy. He hasn't come back? No. I am going to look for him. Maybe he is looking for his kids, like an animal would. How would he know where they are? I want to go get my kids. It's not safe. I know, but you're here. And I miss them. Then take a horse, I’ll go look the other way. Go get ready. Come. Sit down. God returns you to us. I'm going to pray. You've come for your children. Your husband must be better. I'll go get them, they're outside. Have you heard anything from Ademar since you last saw him? Thomas came back thanks to him, but I never saw him again. The bandits have kidnapped my husband. They were asking me for money that I don’t have. Rich or not, without our spouses we're all poor. Mama! Your son is in the field, he's coming. I’ll let you know if he comes here. Every night, in my nightmares, I see that hunchback who took my husband away from me. It hurt. It's true. They hurt you. The bandits beat you. They came back? No. My life… My… My life. You will get your life back. It's okay. Do you recognize me now? Do you remember Guillemette, your wife? And your mother. Do you know she died? You will have to pray. God waits for you. And you found it. Your book. Guillemette went to look for that book, in an abbey far from here. The… Sage. The sage. A garden. And the savages. It's your nephew, Benoit. And your niece, Hildegarde. We call her Hilde. It's Thomas, your father's brother. -Hello. -Hello. There’s a horse in the hills. You can go see it, but don't stand behind it. Did you have a good trip? Did you hear the news? I met a noblewoman at the nurse's, Madame of Montero. Her husband was kidnapped. I think by the same man. She paid Ademar to help her find him, but she hasn’t heard from him since. Two miles from here I found two bodies, Ademar and another warrior. Does that mean her husband is lost? It means that they are always here, but beyond us. You're right. You should sleep with your children. In the book… It said that thistle must be cooked in boiling water for two hours. And that those with hand pain… should drink thistle tea three times a day. Certainly. This book… Everything I know is in there. -That was my only gift. -I know. If you want, we will keep it for us both. No one will know anything. Written things can become the devil's weapons in the wrong hands. I will hide it here. And only you and I will have access to it. What do you say? The one on the horse will play anyway. Right, so go play now. Where were you? You’re limping less. Thomas made me a new shoe. You made her a shoe? Yes. We were waiting for you. Thomas. Thomas! Hello, Benoit. Hello, dad. Where is your sister? Playing with the dog. We have a dog now. Father told me I didn’t hurt anyone. No. You didn't hurt anyone. But I did hit you. You would hit me often when we were younger. Did I deserve it? Not always. Thank you for protecting my wife, and my house. And for killing this man. Thank you for this book. Did you buy it with your money? Give me my horse! Give me my horse! It was with a gold piece, one I earned a long time ago. Anyway, you don’t owe me anything. I owe you everything. I saw the garden. Guillemette has tended to the plants well. You've done a good job. Mother wanted to thank you for leaving. She wanted to run her hand through your hair… And these men… are they coming back? Yes. Good night. Good night, brother. Sleep well. Will we sleep with the kids? They’ve been so far away for weeks. The bed is too small for… for us all. I’ll sleep by the fire. We can't see anything. You have a weapon? -Yes. -Yes. A spear. The spear a patient gave him. There. Yes, a spear. Get it. It’s a good night to attack. Guillemette, make some food and tea. It's going to be a long night. Shh! Listen. Tomorrow I’ll go to their camp off the road in the woods. We can't wait any longer. There are at least four men. -Mama. -I'll go with you. No. You have a wife and kids, I know how to fight. -I don't want you to be involved. -Mama. Go see her, I'll make the tea. How are you going to do it? If I leave at dawn, I should be able to get one or two. Like we did with the foxes? Yes, like we did with the foxes. Go be with your children. I'll watch. Go. Yah! Yah! Go. Go. You are too old. Arnaud! No! Arnaud! Go inside the house. -We don't want to go. -We don't want to! Go. ”Grant them eternal rest, oh Lord.” ”And let light perpetual shine upon them.” ”May they rest in peace, amen.” Amen. In the shadow of his church, the Lord welcomes today two beautiful souls. Because it is here that Guillemette Cantien decided to bury those that she loved. In the shadow of faith and in submission to God. It is wise. It is humble. And we promise him our love, and our support. What we saw written can be pronounced… Fer. Faris. Fer. Faris. Very good. ”Faris” is the genitive. Look. It's written there. No. Hm… There. Next time I’ll bring a feather and ink and you’ll copy the words. How do we say lavender? Lavandula? Lavandula officinalis. Lavandula officinalis. And the lovage plant is called ligusticum. These are concoctions that are not in the book, which… I wrote myself. Arnaud taught them to me when his memory came back. He wanted you to know as much as he did. Let's continue. How do we say vervain? Verbenae? Yes, very good. Now, let’s look in the book to see what they say about oats. In Latin, avena, avenae. Subtitle translation by: Vario Etes
