I refer to my memory, in order to recall what exactly happened. It seemed as though I was dreaming. God willing, he'll be alright. I have a good feeling that he will be healed. I will come by tomorrow. - Pray for him. - God be with you. GOD IS CLOSE chiefs of Unbelievers said: "If Allah wished to send messengers, He could have sent down angels. "Never did we hear such a thing (as he says), among our ancestors of old." And some said: "He is only a madman, so bear with him for a time." Noah said: "O my Lord! Help me, for that they accuse me of falsehood!" Allah the exalted, the almighty has spoken the truth. Syed Yahya, please keep reciting. Don't you want to go to work? I've got things to do, you know! God willing, near the sunset, before the call to prayer. Or tomorrow around this time. Come, and I'll recite to you. Hadji, how much for an apple box? Only a few apples are left. I don't have any more boxes. I don't want the apples, just the box. The box isn't for sale. Just give me any sum and take it. - Is 500 tomans enough? - 500 tomans? It's far too much. God bless you. May God make you light handed. I'll buy all of your apples. - Hi, mother. - Hi. Please wash these, too. What are these that you've bought? They are all rotten! When you peel them, they'll look like other apples. What am I supposed to do with all these apples? Turn them into apple jam. Mr. Reza loves apple jam. I've placed your food on the stove. I may go to your sister's after work. I'll be back a little later. Send my regards. Do you go to Koloodeh? - Are you bringing these, too? - Yes. Get on. What are you doing? With this load, just take a truck. Why did you attach this box to your back? This box is for women. Don't you have a sister yourself!? But I'm not woman! Instead you're carrying too much! Hold tight! I'm gonna ride like a bullet. Hold the box firmly so it won't fall! No one can ride a bike like me. Slow down! I wanna get off! Pull over. - Pull over! I wanna get off! - We haven't arrived yet. I know. The way you're riding... I'm afraid instead of Koloodeh, I'll end up in hell. You should've just told me to slow down. Why are you playing here?! Had I hit you, I would've been in a lot of trouble! Who in the right mind has given you this ride? No one. It's brother Younos'. I've been working with it ever since he left. - Mr. Esmaeili, take these. - Mr. Esmaeili, here you go. Thank you, Yavari. Let's see. You don't have a teacher today again. We do. The principle has asked us to stay in the school yard. - Teacher's supposed to come. - Then what are you doing here? Kids were being noisy. The superintendent asked me to come outside and make them silent. - So I brought them outside. - Okay. Let's go back inside the school. Don't be noisy, wait for your teacher to arrive. Let's go! May God keep you healthy. Will you take me to the Saturday market? Get on the bike, granny. Son, don't you wanna go? You need to get a bike ride to get to Koloodeh from here. The towpath is impaired. Cars can't go there. Mr. Hossain, let's go! Why aren't you leaving, my son? - Son, why aren't you leaving? - Where to? Saturday bazaar! I told you, I was going to Koloodeh! I have no business in Koloodeh. I told you, you don't have a right mind. - Are you going to Saturday bazaar? - Yeah. Excuse me, Mr. How do I get to Koloodeh? Ms. Teacher. You're the teacher. You are the new teacher of Koloodeh school. Aren't you? Everybody says Reza has fully grown up, but his brain's round! The size of a bird's. Someone with a bird's brain... would sit on trees, not on a bike. Tell me if I'm wrong, Ms. Teacher. That's why mostly women get a ride with me. Mother Tooba's told me to tie this box to my back so the passengers hang on to it and don't fall. Oh! My shoe! The river took it. Do you always ride clumsily? Hurry sir, turn it on. I'm late. I need to get to school. - How much is it? - It's on me. Please go. Be my guest. How much is it? I'm late. Like I said, it's on the house. Ms... - Good bye. - Bye. Starting from tomorrow, please be on time. When the students don't have a teacher, they're hard to control. Yes. I'll leave home earlier. Hi, Ms. Teacher. You again? The school has asked me to come pick you up. The road is not safe. Thank you. But I'm not going home now. I'm going to the city. You can come with me. No, thank you. I was gonna go with this gentleman. I'll come after you every morning. Ismaeil asked me. The school caretaker. Hi, Ms. Teacher. Wait a moment. I'll fix it. You got wet. Mr. Reza. My dear. Please turn off your bike when in the school yard. Children are in the classroom, they'll get distracted. "Water". One word, but it has two syllables. First syllable, "wa", second syllable, "ter". So, "water" is one word, but it has two syllables. - You say "water"... - Water! First syllable, "wa", second syllable, "ter". First syllable is dragged like this: "w√§aa". Second syllable, "ter". - Now, everybody say: "water". - Water. - Water. - Water. - Water. - Water. So remember, the first syllable is stressed. Hush! Go away! "Water". One word, but it has two syllables. First syllable, "wa", second syllable, "ter". Now you repeat: "water". Water... What? I want some water. You wanna drink water on an empty stomach? I just want water. - Hey, boy. - Yes? - Will it be a while before you can go home? - You wanna take Ms. Teacher home? Yes. You know, I need to go home early. Do you like candy? Okay, everybody, today's lesson is over. Now you can do your homework until the bell rings. Whoever's got a question can ask me. - May I, Miss? - What is it, Yavari? Now that the class is over, could you ask the principal - to let us go home early? - There's still an hour before the the bell. Now, get to work until then. Got it? Psst! Excuse me, Ms? What now? - Can I go to the restroom? - But you were just out. Last time I drank water, this time I need to use the restroom. Go, but come back soon. Come in, Yavari. What's the matter? Ms. Teacher said the class is over... - and if it's okay, could the students go home? - The class is over? Children wanna go home? What? She comes late in the morning! And this is how she teaches...! No! Stay in the classroom until I ring the bell. What are you starring at? - Go back to class. - Yes, sir. May I? The principal said if the children have nothing else to do, they can go home. Okay, everyone. Get your stuff and go home. Ms. Baniamel. Could you explain what's going on here? Where are they going? But Yavary told me that you said it's okay for the students to go home. Yavari! Just wait until I catch you! You'll come to school with your father tomorrow. Go, go! It's not my fault! A bike isn't a donkey, you can't cross the river easily. Water is harmful for it. Please sit for a minute, and I'll fix it. How's this bike supposed to run on this spark plug? What do you want? - Nothing. - I said, what do you want? Your braid.. Braid.. The spark plug is malfunctioning. You are crazy! Why don't you talk? "The heart of mine is full of pain but alas there's nothing to sooth it." This is Hafez's poem. No. It's Seyyed Yahya's poem. He recites it, whenever he feels sad. I, too, recite a poem... when I'm gloomy. "O, love! Your ancestor is fire. "Your texture is smoke and your roots of wind. "Water turned into a whirlpool, and soil turned into ashes. "Fire got mixed with wind due to your scent. "And every place without Shirin, is like the ruins of Bisotoon. "Every mountain without Farhaad, is like a hay in the wind. "The generations of our ancestors were sadness. "Our inheritance has been eternal sorrow. "Our dust smells of you in the wind. "Only you will remain, "when we are all gone." I didn't mean it. Well, I was scared. What happened, sister? The bike's broken? Its spark plug isn't working. I just cleaned it. - Oh, really? It is the spark? - It will be fine in a moment. I wish my spark would've got broken here. IT'S FIXED!! I LOVE YOU!! It's fixed, Ms. Teacher! You're better, aren't you? - Luck you. - Thank you.. Thank you.. Ms Teacher! - What do you want, sirrah! - Ms. Teacher didn't show up today. Is this a stable or what? You can't just come in like that. I said, what do you want?! Now I'll teach you a lesson. Mr. Borzoo... Let him go. This is Reza. He's come after me. - What's going on? Who's this stranger? - He is no stranger, Mr. Borzoo. Leila commutes a long way. The road's been out of order a few days now. Mr. Reza is a decent man. He just takes her to school and back home. Ms. Teacher, it's too late. I didn't see you at the usual spot, so I came after you. What's new with Ms. Teacher lately? She is at school. My dearest son, come and eat. Ms. Teacher taught well. Everyone, write "water" 100 times. - May I, Sir? - Get to work. Lesson "water". - Why are you laughing? - Sir, Mustafa is about to wet his pants. Go, but come back quickly. Tonight's lesson is about "water". Excuse me, Sir! - What is it, Mustafa? Why are you crying? - May I... Sir... it happened. But your pants are dry. May I...? The other one...! What's going on? Why are you jumping around? What are you doing, kids? Who's controlling the kids here? - Mr. Ismael, where's the principal? - He went to the city. He went to inform the local office that this class has no teacher. Maybe they send someone instead of Ms. Baniamel. We can't study like this. Haven't you got a surveillant? May I...? Mustafa wanted to go to the bathroom... Salam, Ms. Tooba. May your homage be accepted.. Salam, Seyyed Yahya, May God accept it. How is Reza? Well... he's been acting differently for quite some time. He has changed completely. He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep. When he is home, he just sits and... - wonders. - What's happened? - Why does he act like that? - He doesn't talk about it. Mr. Seyyed Yahya, will you talk to him? To tell you the truth, it has been some time since he came here regularily. But if he does come, I will. I will ask him. Maybe he wants to get married. You know very well. Everybody says Reza is a bit crazy. They won't accept him. Reza is wiser than most of the people. The only problem is that he doesn't take business seriously. But, instead his heart is as pure as a child. God bless you, Brother. - Goodbye. - Farewell. I knew you'd come back to school. While you were absent, I made them sit quietly. - Salam. - Salam, Ms Baniamel. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Sorry I couldn't inform you. My mother got sick. So, I had to take her to the hospital. And then my wedding arrangements and.. Congratulations. I wish you had informed us. To tell you the truth, my fianc√© doesn't approve that I work. He said I shouldn't come here any more, since the school is too far. I have really missed the children. What do you suggest we do with your students? It will take us a long time to find a new teacher. Sir, I would really love to come. But, as I said... my husband doesn't approve it. There's no one to take your place in the class. And I can't call the class off. The students will become cold and hopeless. I will have to manage somehow, until a new teacher is sent. - Hello, dear Leila. - Clap for the new bride. - Congratulations. - All the best wishes. - How are you, Miss Baniamel? Congratulations. - Thank you. I wish you all the best. Don't worry about the rest. - Salam, Mr Principal. - Salam, Mr Esmail. - How are you, Mr Reza? - Not bad. You let me on my own, O, my lady! You parted me from your love, O my lady! You made me a refuge in the wild world, O my lady! The flower tree is now at the bloom, O, my lady! O Allah! All praise is for You alone. Praise of the "Ever-thankful to You", who glorify You whatever come to pass. All praise is for Allah for my deep-felt intense grief. O Allah, make available for me the advice of Husayn on the day I present myself before You, let me stand firm in safety before You on account of my sincere attachment with Husayn, along with him and his comrades, who sacrificed everything they had (heart, mind, soul and life) for Husayn, peace be on him. Long time no see? Why are you sad? Ms. Teacher... Ms. Teacher doesn't teach the lesson of "water" any more. No one learns "water" any more. What shall the students do now? Are you thinking about them, or wondering what you should do? Well, it seems like you are really stuck on her. So your mom should start looking for a nice girl. Seyyed Yahya, what does that mean? It means loving the one who is the most beautiful. It means lighting the fire of love in your heart. It means you become all eyes and ears. I am sad, Seyyed Yahya. You were sad, too, weren't you? Yes, son. I have been in love all my life. I've been a lover all my life. Does Ms. Teacher come here, too? Have you seen her? No, my dear Reza. My teacher teaches love. Not reading and writing. Loving Leili. They call him the Imam of Love. Your brother Younos fell in love with the same beloved... and went to the heavens to Leili. So, she's called Leili, too. Where is she now? Can you show me? The Holy Quran is the words of God and His message. The Holy Quran shows what's right and what's wrong. Where ever it is, be sure that, the light of guidance is there. Due to the Holy Prophet Muhammad and his progeny. Not every one can learn the art of love. Not every hunter can catch this prey. Love needs capacity; He who seeks God must have a true heart. Love is revealed first by the beloved. So that the lover sees beyond. I miss brother Younos. Well, we can go to the cemetery if you want. Why to the cemetery? Why not to the heaven, where he is? Mother... doesn't brother Younos get bored in the heaven? You're thinking again.. Why aren't you eating? Come on, eat. Is your son feeling bad again? He's burning like a candle. It's like he can't think right. I have locked up his motorbike. I'm worried something might happen to him. Haven't you found Leili? God bless you. Reza... Wake up. Look... Your sister Nargess and aunt Kahnaz are here to see you. Wake up, my dear. It looks like he is much worse this time. You should have taken him to a doctor. I did. We tried all kinds of medicine but didn't work. I brought him to this holy shrine. May this son of holy Imam Hussain cure him... or put me in peace. I can't take it any more. The man who had a beautiful shining face smiled and said: "Eat, Reza. This bread is a different kind. It is from heaven..." Mother was happy and smiling. He said mother is very tired. She wants to go to brother Younos. There was a lot of light behind the door. So bright you couldn't look at it. Mother went through the door... and disappeared in the light. When I turned my head, the man was gone. I suddenly woke up. I was holding the bread and crystal sugar, and I was at the shrine. I suddenly felt hungry and started eating. Then I saw mother against the wall, she was fast asleep. Or so I thought. There was no sign of sadness on her face any more. It was as if she was laughing in her dreams. Her rosary was in her hand and Holy Quran on her lap. No one was there at that time in the morning. When I held her hand... it was cold and lifeless. Still I haven't learnt the secret behind this cure and that departure. As if I had a dream. God's work is all based on reason. We should be happy for what He chooses for us. Haj Ghasem, God accepts your homage. Did you pray for us too? You don't come very often. I am very busy, Seyyed Yahya. - Pray for us. - We are in need of prayer. - Goodbye. - May God be with you. It is okay, I'll leave this bag with you. I will take it when I finish my prayers. No problem at all. I will leave it with your shoes. You can take them when you want to leave. - Pray for us, my dear daughter. - Thank you, Haj Yahya. Hello, Ms. Teacher. Hello. You have really changed. I didn't recognize you. You have changed, too. How's Mr. Borzoo? No news. We got a divorce. "Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil. "We descend not but by command of thy Lord. To Him belongeth what is before us... "and what is behind us, and what is between... "and thy Lord never doth forget. "Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them. "So worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship. "Knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?" Allah the exalted, the almighty has spoken the truth. He really insisted. He was so stubborn. They wouldn't accept no for an answer. I told him, "I have to look after my mother... "she is sick, I can't leave her alone... "I have to work..." I told him, I am all she has. "She has to go to the hospital for dialysis. "I must stay with her." He was wealthy and didn't listen to me. He kept insisting, no matter what I said. I told him the treatment is expensive. Your mother is like my own, I will pay for it. What do you say? After one year, I still couldn't give him a child. So he started picking on me. I told him he can divorce me if he wants. And he did. We got a divorce in less than two years. Later I heard his cousin was in love with him and encouraged him. They got married. Last night I had a strange dream. I saw the sunshine next to me. It was talking to me. I told him how sad I was. How tired of everything. He told me, "Why don't you go to the shrine and talk about your sadness?" Then I woke up suddenly. I had a strange feeling. And I came here. I don't know why I'm telling you all this... Last week, I went to the school and asked the principal to see... if I can go back to school. He said he will see to it. By the way, Mr. Reza... are you still working on that route? I quit that job long ago. But if I do decide to work again, I'll ride the same route and be teacher's special service. Reza's bike hasn't worked in a long time. Where are you going, Reza? You're all dressed up. I'm going after Leili, Seyyed Yahya. Going after Leili. Leili came to you yesterday. You let her go. I'm after another Leili. One that no one can take away. The one that I can talk to, whenever I want. The one who is closer than any other one to us. If you have that love, you won't need any other. God's grace is everywhere.. But, you should see where you feel closer to him. When you caress an orphan child, or shelter a homeless, or visit a sick person, or sooth a broken heart. I can't love two. How can people live without Leili? Everyone's after a beloved. But, some are mistaken. Only God knows what happened to you at the shrine that you changed so much. I can't stay here anymore. I have a strange feeling. I can't fit in this world anymore. So you can't stay here anymore. Where do you want to take your broken heart? To the land of loneliness. To the field of Ninava. Where you said the angels call it Karbala. "The three sadness came to me at one, "I was a stranger, a prisoner and away from my love. "Being a stranger and in a prison you can cope, "But, what can I do without my love... without my love, without my love..." - Salam. - Salam Alaikum. - Ms. Narges, you should visit Reza more often. - Yes, sure. I want to give my dear Reznaveh something I don't know if she likes it or not. Do you like it? Will you put it in my hair, uncle? Sure, my dear. I love you. Go to your mom. You could at least pay us a visit once in a while. Come for dinner if you like. Okay. Son. Can you help me? God be with you. God bless you. God be with you. God bless you. God be with you. I told you yesterday. I don't go to Koloodeh village any more. I know. I don't go there any more, either.
