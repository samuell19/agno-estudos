For the people who win a lot, we're the ones who stop them. It's not about technique. It's about luck. All gamblers experience such a feeling. When you are lucky, nothing can stop you. Same with us - no one can beat us. But there's one difference... We have enough dealers to keep changing, until the gambler loses. All the gambler has is himself. For this past half year, until tonight, no gambler was luckier than I was. Ren, congratulations! Sue told me that Bobo is 2 months pregnant good work! Thank you! Fred quit? Who is he anyway?

I know what you are thinking. You want the money in the safe,right? No way. Listen to me first... In the past half year, whose table won the most for the club? Yours. Have I ever lost any money? No. Six bullets, all coming for me, all missed. She sucks. Stop joking around. Take it! Stab me. Go ahead See, you know why? Because I have luck and I can feel it. scared of this? You call this luck?

I wanted to take revenge for him. he backed out. In the end, I took the guy out myself. I scolded him for chickening out afterwards. But this time it's different he isn't afraid. with me. It's because he knows luck is not on his side. He is afraid that he would drag me down. Banker wins! My god! 10 grand, I bet for you. Thank you. Twenty-two, player wins. Yes! Banker wins!

Wondering why you could foretell the future. And the "you", who was previously in the car, ride to here. you've lost your memories. Therefore, some people claim that they have the sixth sense... They think they could tell the future. through a warp in time. They are just recalling what they have seen. you get that? It's an interesting story. Someone told me. Please give this to Sing.

That's why there were 3 women all together. What did they look like? One is white and one is black. The black girl has stronger thighs. on the inner part of her thigh. The other one is thin. it smells horrible. Sir, I am asking what she looks like. Not about thighs or ass. I can't put an ass up on the wanted list. Officer, they assaulted me from the back, I had no chance to look at their faces. I just saw a black ass sitting on my face. I tried to fight back. The black ass then sat on my chess. I couldn't move at all. Then, the white ass suddenly followed... She sat on my face. That's the ass with the horrible smell. with chloroform taking a shit. I just took one careless breath, and I lost consciousness. Don't laugh, I could sue you. Do you want to see a doctor? Ren... how was it? Win or lose? I haven't even gone yet. Not yet? Where have you been then? That policewoman made me eat donuts. Donuts?! Where's the money? You have it. You have it. Oh my God, you're going crazy again! You asked me to find a girl, then...

I want to bet one more thing. Go ahead. the winner, forever. Sure. Shuffle. Cut. It's not necessary. In this game, I will have two face cards. You will get a 7 first. Then, an eight. Then, a six. Who do you think you are? Okay, I will show you my cards. Let's see whether your forecast is correct. Make your bet please. A thousand. Are you kidding me? How can this be?! You won a thousand from me. I want another card. Come on, hell no! Do you know why you lost? Someone told me once... When you gamble, you should remain calm. You should read your opponent's mind. your willpower. I know I have better luck than you do. had such a little chance of winning. I told myself, now, luck is on my side. I am invincible. You are Jesus. Wherever I go in future, you can't show up. Because, those places are... ... prohibited to God. Mr. Lee, this is your cheque. you very much. We need you to work for us. This invitation is 2 years late. You need me now? But I don't need you. They're gone. Just hold it right there. What are you doing? Are you from the 25th? Listen to me first... Officer... an illegal immigrant who assaulted a police officer. Madam, I told you many times, I am not an illegal immigrant. I just... I just did one wrong thing. My friend will die. I have to save him. My friend is now in the Blue Diamond Bar. Ask someone to go save him. I don't know what you are talking about. Madam, listen to me... Let's go! Please just let me make a call. Madam... Can you pass a long message for me? What? I might not see her again... If you see a girl who looks like you, please tell her that... "animal love" does work. On this morning, when she was facing me on her back, it was very familiar... And then I realized... When I fell from the cliff. into the time tunnel, that I'd seen that scene before. I saw us... falling in love. We were together... At last, we would have had a happy ending. Anyway, I finally found my ex-girlfriend, and I took the engagement ring back.
