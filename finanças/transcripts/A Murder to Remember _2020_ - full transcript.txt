hey, it's gonna be okay. It's almost over. You just have to hold on a little longer. it's gonna be okay. I promise. don't you dare. it's talking to me. Don't you listen. Have a tootsie pop. can I help you? There was an accident. A-a bad one. My husband, javier, was shot. Yeah, we were, we were, we were hunting and the gun just went off. Mavis, I got this. I'm gonna have you take a seat, mister... - Sam turner, ma'am. - That's a nasty cough. Mavis, just fetch him some cold medicine. Here, have a seat, mr. Turner, while I talk to... Robin... Rivera. thanks. Now I heard the part about your husband being shot. You want to tell me how that happened? Start at the beginning, don't leave anything out. Javier, that's my husband... We met at school. He was the goof, class clown, always trying to make people laugh. But he had the best heart. You and javier, how long you've been married? One year tomorrow. Okay. go on. We were celebrating our anniversary and javier thought it would be fun to go camping. In October? Thought it might be romantic to be alone in the wilderness together. He's the only thing I needed to keep me warm. ♪ there's one more decision a secret to keep ♪ ♪ that you wait around to say ♪ ♪ I'll make the promise... ♪♪ so, are you gonna tell me what it is? "are you gonna tell me what it is?" shh! - Stop! Stop! - Tell me! - Tell me! Okay. - Hold on! Hold on, hold on! Now, remember, mrs. Rivera, the first anniversary is supposed to be something made out of paper. Okay. What's it? What? Babe! Oh... "may our marriage last one year for every piece." oh, my god. I love it! Ah, it still feels so weird. I mean, even after a year when someone calls me mrs. Rivera, you know what I do? I look around for your mom. Ooh, speaking of my mom, she's gonna swing by the apartment and, uh, and drop off some tamales. Isn't it bananas finally having our own place?

Okay, nothing could be better than this. Check under your seat. I... I... Love it. Yeah. It was my grandmother's. She will be so happy to know you're wearing it. I'll never take it off. - it's perfect! - Not quite what I imagined. oh. I-I know it's not our trip to hawaii like you asked, I just... Hey, you promised me thailand! thailand, hawaii, peoria, wherever you want, babe. 'cause we're gonna travel the world together, hm. It's nice to be together. No work, no parents, just you and me, alone in the wilderness. Oh, alone? Well, uh... Except for all the other people here who's camping with us. Well, I guess we gotta be extra quiet, then. Come on. I can't believe you never went camping out before. I did an overnight with my girl scout troop... Oh, backyards don't count. at least there weren't any animals out there looking to get me, wanting to eat me. Can't believe ms. Fearless is scared of all the cute little bunnies and deer and everything in the woods. - I'm not scared, okay? - Okay, good. Because there's nothing to be scared of. I know. Well, um, except for maybe, uh... Except what? El cuco! - Who's el cuco? No. - Oh, you've never heard of him? He's like the boogeyman, wandering through the woods looking for people to eat, or if you're unlucky, he'll make you his slave for life! but I don't think you have to worry about that. Because el cuco only eats children. Oh. Well, then you're the one who needs to be scared. - Really? - Because you act like a child. but, seriously, stick to the trails. People get lost out here all the time, even on day hikes. Then I'm sticking to you like glue. - Let's get back to the campsite. - Okay. Oh, heavy. look, there's the sign for the campsite. We're almost there. you're just excited about the fishing. that's not true, I'm excited about fishing and time with you. guess we aren't the only ones who thought it'd be quiet out here 'cause it's off season. I just hope no one gets in the way of my fishing. Look, wa-ha-ha... So I bet your dad I'd catch enough fish to make us all fish tacos when we got home. But sounds doable, right? I was thinking like five fish... you're gonna catch five fish? - Oh, I will. - You've never even gotten one! - I'm a fishing machine. - Um... you don't believe me! I believe you think you can fish. I think we should start fishing before it gets dark. I can't believe you made that bet with dad. stop! Please stop! And I'm gonna prove him wrong. Okay? And then I'm gonna make him the best fish tacos north of guadalajara. - Good luck, fishing machine. - Okay? not one bite. That smells good. What's for dinner? Hm. Delicious freeze-dried chili. - Ooh! - Not as good as fresh fish. Mm. Well, dessert will more than make it up to you. I want that to be us someday. A bunch of kids and our parents and our friends and their kids... That's a lot of people to fit in one station wagon. Hm. wake up, sleepyhead. Early bird catches the fish, babe. We can't let a little rain stop us. I had... The worst nightmare. I was, I was in the woods and there was this man chasing me and I was screaming your name, and-and you wouldn't answer me. - That's 'cause el cuco got me. - Still not funny. I have the most beautiful, sexiest, worst fisherman wife a man could want. Why-why would I go anywhere? I know. But it still scared me. I-I was, I was just talking to jake. He said there's a stream up the way they just salted a few days ago. Thanks for the coffee, jake. hey, I've been thinking about why you're not catching anything. Oh, yeah? Yeah, it might be your choice of bait. - hm... - Heh-heh. Let's try some new bait. Real magic's right there in the dirt. Earthworms are the best bait. - Get digging, babe. - Okay. - Oh, oh, god. - Ha-ha-ha.. - Ew-ew, no. You, you do this. - Well, okay. ew. No. No, no, no, no, no. javy? Javy, where are you? Javy! Javy! Javy! Javy! Come on, it's not funny. Javy, you're scaring me! Please, where are... Ah! - It's me, it's me. - I-I was lost. And I had no idea where you were and I just... Hey, calm down, I was just putting our stuff back in the car. Okay. that stream was a bust. It's freeze-dried lasagna for dinner. Hey! Over here! Oh, god. Oh, am I so glad to see you folks. I've been stuck out here, man, I-I can't get her to move. Oh, I'm sorry. Where are my manners? I'm sam turner. It's a pleasure, man. Hey... What do you say? Hm. Yeah, I'm sure we can get it out. Really? Yes! You're amazing! Thank you. Robin, get in and give it gas when I say. Mm-hmm. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. now! Come on. Come on. Ah... yes! Hey. whoo! Yes! Oh, my gosh, I cannot thank you folks enough. Truly. So what-what, what brings you guys out here, anyway? Fishing. We just, uh, heard they salted the stream up the way. I know these woods like the back of my hands and that stream is not worth swimming in. Someone sent you to the wrong spot. I, I kinda figured that. We didn't catch anything. Well, look, uh, I heard they were dumping fish a little further up that way. I can show you where it's at. Right? I mean, you helped me with my truck. Make us even? - Our gear's back in... - I don't know. I... I think we're just gonna walk back to the camp and... Just hold on. You know, just give us a sec-second. - He seems nice. - You think everyone is nice. have you seen the guy's car? It looks like he's living in it. Honey, please don't let me go home empty-handed. Your dad will never let me live it down. Look, I don't wanna butt in, but it's my own secret fishing spot, it's only a couple of miles away. The other day I caught a trout bigger than she is. - Okay. Let's do it. - Yay! Alright. Hop in, I'll bring you back to your car and you can follow me from there. Boop-boop! ♪ oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ and I won't hide ♪♪ ♪ oh-oh-oh-oh ♪♪♪ like the back of his hand, huh? It feels like we've been driving around in circles. don't be like that. And how would you even know where we are? The woods look exactly the same everywhere we go. I'm pretty sure I've seen that turn off like twice already. come on, javy, be nice. I must have been daydreaming, man, I-I feel silly. Man, I took a wrong turn back at the fork. That's about two miles back. Yeah. Yeah. so what should we do? Well, uh, we could camp here for the night. I think we should head back. But it's getting dark and we already decided to camp out anyways. Yeah, we'll wake up bright and early, catch those fish! We could get lost. And we don't want el cuco to get us, right? Okay! I-I guess we're camping here tonight. whoo! I love you. javy, javy, look, look, a deer. - It's so beautiful. - What are you doing? Baggin' myself a deer. You wanna come? What do you think dad's gonna think about deer tacos? I don't know. He'll be too busy eating my fish tacos. Hey, wait for me! javy! And you saw the gun go off? Then what happened? robin. Robin, you saw it, I just handed him the gun. no, no. Robin. Robin, robin. Robin! Robin, get back here, you'll get... You're gonna get lost out there! robin! Robin, you're gonna get lost out there! You're gonna get hurt out here, robin! robin! It was an accident! You saw it was an accident! Hey! You need to calm down. Okay? We have to get out of here. We have to go get help. Okay? Come on. I was so upset, I just took off. I-I, I got us lost. If sam hadn't been there, I don't think it... No, I, I-I know I would have never found my way out of those woods. Sam saved my life. - Mom! - Oh, oh, oh. It's so awful, I just, I just wanna die, too. - Oh... - Mrs. Johnson? What's going on here? My son-in-law is dead? - Why is my daughter being held... - ma'am, please. If you'll come with me, I'll explain everything. - Do I need to call a lawyer? - Robin is not under arrest. Why don't you come on back to my office? No, no, no, no, no. Mom, please, please don't leave me... No, no, no, no! I'm not going anywhere. Look, I'm just going right over there, look! You can see me. I promise, I am not leaving without you. javier was shot. It appears to be a hunting accident for now, but until we complete a proper investigation and autopsy, we're not gonna know a whole lot. A hunting accident? But with whose gun? Neither javier nor my daughter own one. The gun belonged to that man, mr. Turner. But... Well... Apparently, when mr. Turner handed your son-in-law his gun, it accidentally went off. - Robin said that... - robin saw it happen? Oh. My poor baby. Oh, my god, have you called javy's parents? Oh, I can't even imagine. They're gonna be devastated. Where is he? His remains are still out there. It'll be too dark for us to do anything tonight, but believe me, we will be out there first light. "his remains." - oh, my god. - Look, take a breath. Let things settle, and take robin home. she said I can take you home now. No, mom, please, j-just bring me back to your house. - Shh. Of course, of course. - Please. That's what I meant. hey, robin, uh, I'm... I just wanna say I'm sorry for everything. Um... Mom, this, this is sam. Without him I would have never made it out of the woods. Uh, sam turner, ma'am. Thank you, mr. Turner, for... Bringing robin home safe. Of course. Hey, robin. I just want you to remember what I promised. I, I'm always gonna be around no matter what happens, uh, keeping my eye on you and, and your mom. Bye, sam. alright, we're gonna put you up in a motel tonight and I'll have a doc swing by to check you out there. Then tomorrow we're gonna go back in those woods and you're gonna show me what the heck happened. And let's just hope the animals don't get to the body before we do. why don't you lie down for a little bit and I will bring you a cup of noodle soup? - No, mom... - I'll be... I'll be right back, baby. - I'll be right back. - No! Let me just get the phone. I'll be right back, I promise you. I promise you. hello? Oh! I'm so, so sorry. Why don't, why don't both of you come over? robin... yeah, robin's here now. Right, okay. I'll-I'll see you soon. That was ana. She and emiliano are on their way over. No, no, I don't wanna see them. - Are you sure? - What did I just say? - I don't want to see them! - Alright, alright. Uh, I'll tell them that you're just, you're not up to it yet. I don't know what to tell them. It's my fault he died. I don't know what to do to make them feel better, I... No, no, no, robin, no one is blaming you. This was a tragic accident, and everyone is struggling to come to terms with it. Now, baby, I am here for you and I will help you in any way I can. thanks, mom. Okay, uh, I'm sorry, I just need to see if I can get a hold of ana before she leaves. stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Run! Robin! Robin, get up! Hurry, they're coming! Robin! Come on, we gotta go or they're gonna kill us both! good morning, sweetheart. How are you feeling? Hungry? Mom, it wasn't a dream, was it? I'm so sorry, sweetheart. You're grieving. Take as long as you need. There's no time limit when it comes to losing someone you love. Oh. That is so beautiful. Javy gave it to me. It was his grandmother's. I miss him so much. I know you do. What am I gonna do? You're strong, robin. Much stronger than you think. You're gonna get through this... And I'm gonna be right here with you the whole way. Thanks, mom. Why don't you go take a bath while I make us some breakfast, okay? it was an accident! You saw it was an accident! stop it. you're such a sweet girl. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Robin! Oh. It's okay. Let it out. Cry, you scream, whatever you want. Talk to me. It's... It's all foggy in my head, but... I don't think it was an accident. I think... I think sam killed javier on purpose. - what's your name? - Sam turner. - Where do you live? - Uh... - Uh, here and there, you know? - What do you mean? Uh, well, um, I'm between places at the moment. alright. You got the baseline? We good to do this? - Yeah. Good to go. - Alright. Let's get the hard one out of the way. Did you shoot javier rivera? Yes... But it was an accident. I would never hurt anyone. In your statement you said that you forgot to put the safety on. - Is that correct? - Yes. Uh, I handed the gun to javier, but, honestly, uh, I was kinda distracted when I did it. Robin was kind of flirting with me, making me uncomfortable. What exactly was mrs. Rivera doing? Ah, well, I don't, I don't know, she... I mean, I could just tell she liked me, you know? so just to be clear here, you're saying that mrs. Rivera flirted with you and this distraction is what made you shoot her husband? No. No. No, that's not what I'm saying. It's my fault, you know, distracted or not, I should've checked the damn safety. After mr. Rivera was shot, did you move the body? Lord, no, no, I didn't touch him. But robin did. - Robin did that? - Yeah. Look, I don't wanna talk badly about robin. She's a nice kid, but... You know, after the accident I thought she was a little... Out of control. So you think that a woman being emotional after she's just watched her husband die is out of control? I'm just telling you what I saw and how it made me feel. Is everything you've told me today the truth? Yes, ma'am. Honest truth, I swear it. alright. Thank you for your cooperation, mr. Turner. It's greatly appreciated. Where is she? I demand to speak with the sheriff. - Mrs. Johnson? - Oh! Javier's death was not an accident. Sheriff, I am so sorry, she just barged in, all worked up. What did you do? - That man is responsible for... - mrs. Johnson... What did you do, you son of a bitch? Mrs. Johnson, the middle of the station is not the place to discuss this. - What did you do? - Mrs. Johnson! I don't know what she's talking about. Robin, tell her I didn't do anything wrong. - Mr. Turner, you're free to go. - Free to go? Did you hear what I just said? This man... - Mrs. Johnson, robin. - Is resp... in my office right now. you are letting that man go! Look, I know that this is a traumatic time for you both, that it is not easy to lose a loved one. However, you need to calm the heck down. I can't have you causing a ruckus and threatening witnesses... Oh, he's no witness. - You need to arrest the man. - Arrest him for what? You don't just point at someone and I put them in jail. That is not how the law works. You need to tell the sheriff exactly what you told me. She needs to know what kind of man she's dealing with. - He murdered javy. - Just-just... Mom, I just, I just, I just wanna go home. Okay? Please. Tell her, baby. It's really important. It's all just flashes of memory in my head. I don't remember, okay? It's just, it's all blurry. But I think sam, sam kidnapped me. - Held me hostage in the woods. - Hostage? Javier, my husband, af-after he got shot, sam kept, kept me in the woods for a really long time. Okay, robin, I need you to tell me something because I'm in the dark here. Now, I thought that this happened yesterday when you and mr. Turner came into the station. But you're telling me that's not the case. When exactly did javier die? On the second day, Monday. And then sam just took me really deep into the woods and, well, I was just lost, I don't know where I was and I thought we were going to be there forever. That's five days ago. You were in the woods with that man for five days? I-I-I don't know! Okay? I don't know what happened to me. I, I don't know what... I don't know! okay, come on now. Come on. Come on. Javy said people die out here... Even if it's just Sunday hikes. Yeah, I reckon, you know, there's lots of places to get lost, and no one would ever find your body. I just, I can't stop shaking, and I'm really thirsty. Oh, I guess you should've thought of that before you ran. That came out wrong. I, uh, I have a canteen in my pack. Uh, okay, well, I guess this is as good a place as any to stop for the night. Have you ever made camp before? Okay, well, uh, let's get some firewood and I'll get a fire going. I said, let's get some wood. I'm just, I'm just really tired. I just wanna stay here. hey. It's not safe out here. We have to stick together, robin. If you don't do what I say, you're gonna die. - Good girl. - I-I'll go with you. You do what I say and, uh, and listen to me when I talk, I appreciate that. hey, uh, I know you probably don't know, but I'm a lot more important than you realize. I do something special and I'm not supposed to talk about it. It's the kind of thing you, you get on a need-to-know basis, but I figured I could tell you. You know? That's why you have to do everything I say. It's like we're on a secret mission... I'm your commanding officer. Attention, soldier! Stop! Stop! Robin, come back! Well, I was just fooling! Please! Just let me go! Please, just leave me alone! robin! I told you not to run. You should... You just... you should let, leave me alone. You just... You just leave me here. - I'll just-just slow you down. - Shh! Look, if I left you here, you won't be alive. Okay, I told you I'm a special person. My name's not sam. It's kent. I work for a secret government agency. It's called the organization. That helicopter? That's them. They're trying to track me. They're the reason I had to kill your husband. He figured out what I was, and he could be one of them. Okay? Okay, let's go. he said that the organization made him do it. That's, that's all I can remember. Okay, robin. Is everything you've told me today true? You need to say the word. Yes. That's enough for now. Thank you, robin. I know this wasn't easy for you, and I appreciate you doing it. sheriff. Ah. Hey, reach out to russell stafford at the justice department, he owes me a favor. Ask about a government agency called the organization. And send mrs. Johnson in here, alright? your mother's here, robin. You okay, baby? So, are you gonna arrest this son of a bitch? Well, right now we have zero proof that sam turner committed a crime. Which means, we have no grounds to arrest him. You've got to be kidding me! Uh... Did you not hear what my daughter just told you? She took a polygraph, for god's sakes. We have no physical evidence that mr. Turner committed a crime. It's robin's word against his. And mr. Turner... Uh, he passed his polygraph. But he-he-he killed javier on purpose. Robin... You've suffered a tremendous shock and maybe because of it, your memory's playing tricks on you. But what I told you was the truth. Hey, baby, will you go get me a cup of coffee? I wanna talk to the sheriff for a minute. Look, mrs. Johnson, there's something else I need to talk to you about. I believe my daughter. If she says this is what happened, it happened. I believe robin believes this is what happened, and the human brain is real good at playing tricks on us. It comes up with ways to avoid painful truths and makes up with all kinds of stories to help us cope with our guilt. It can make us believe things that just aren't true. Right now I strongly suggest that you get robin some counseling. Explain the missing days. What were they doing all that time? It makes no sense, unless you know that man is a murderer and he was holding my daughter against her will. We won't know anything for sure until we get the autopsy report for time of death. Mrs. Johnson, I am looking into this. But the best thing you can do for robin is to get her some help. Oh, I can't believe you'd believe the word of some stranger who wanders around in the woods over my daughter! Robin failed her polygraph. Yeah. Robin... robin, what's going on? Do you see that? I think they're following us. Keep driving, mom, please. Don't-don't-don't stop. I... oh, it's the organization, they, they found me, just like sam said they, they would. robin, what are you talking about? they know where we live. They're going to kill me. - No one's going to kill you. - You weren't there. You don't know! Mom, please, don't stop! Don't pull in. They're right behind us, mom, please. - Baby. - Please, don't, mom! - Please. - You're not making any sense. Calm down, robin. Robin, what is happening with you? That's just mrs. Daniels, robin. Hi! Hello, celeste. Robin. Hello, mrs. Daniels. I, I-I thought, I thought they were following us. Oh! Oh, baby. It is what happened, okay? Just... Parts that I can remember. Of course, it is. I believe you. I don't care what that stupid lie detector test said. Do you think I'm losing my mind? Of course not. And whatever happened out in those woods, that man is never going to touch you again. Do you hear me? Over my dead body, anyone ever going to hurt you again. Now come on. And I'm gonna be right here if you need anything. sheriff, this is donnie from the state police. Check your inbox, just sent you some information on that sam turner fellow. I'll be... Look at that record. Looks like sam turner isn't such a nice guy after all. Feels like half of my heart's been ripped out of me, mom. when your dad passed, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't accept that this was the new normal. It was like a world that used to be in color went all grey. And after a while, you forget what color it even is, you're just living in that dark place all the time. One day I heard his voice in my head and... It was not a happy sound. He said, "celeste, I love you, girl, but you're screwing this up." that, that sounds like dad. He said I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself, that the cancer might've gotten him, but he wasn't gone and he wasn't gonna watch me be a sad sack for the next 40 years. Really? Hand to god. And I know javy doesn't wanna watch you give up on your life, baby. It's different. Dad was sick and javy was shot. Sam turner is walking around and my husband's dead. How can I live my life when he stole javier's? You just do it, baby, because if you don't, then that man wins. And instead of taking one life, he'll have taken two. - I don't want him to win. - Then don't let him. I need to see javier's parents. Tell them what happened. They'll, they'll believe me. They've been through a lot, I-I'm not sure telling them all the things you think happened is a good idea. - But they deserve to know. - They're grieving, baby. You don't believe me. You say you do, but you don't. - That's not true. - Then call them. I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Emil, please, please be nice. Not a good idea. My son. Mi corazon is dead and your daughter was there. I want to see her. - Please, don't do this. - Don't do what? Demand to know the truth of what happened to our son? The sheriff says it was an accident, but robin says it was murder. I need to see my daughter-in-law. Okay. She's upstairs. honey, ana and emiliano are here. Papa rivera... You gave her this? Javier asked to have it. It was for robin, for their anniversary. I, I didn't... I mean... Here, you should have it. No, this was a mistake. We should go. Tell me how my son died. The truth. He was, he was murdered. How? I thought it was an accident. And I don't know why. I just, I don't remember. But he was shot. this... This is your fault. It's all my fault, all my fault. Ana. No, no, no, no, no. Please. javier was born after we were told ana would have no more children. My son, I know you are with your maker. You were the best of us, the best of me. robin, celeste. I took a look at sam's record. He's a bad guy, he is a convicted felon and a liar. And yesterday my contact at the justice department confirmed that there is no secret government entity called the organization. I'm not surprised. Look, I don't care what the lie detector says, I believe that sam murdered javier. Okay. I need to see him locked up. Good. I want that, too, but I'm gonna need your help. Now, there's somebody that I want you to talk to. He's agreed, as a favor to me, to speak with you at no charge. I want you to clear your mind. Now imagine you're in an elevator on the tenth floor and with each floor you pass on your way to the bottom, you'll find yourself getting more and more relaxed. Feel the elevator vibrating as it starts its descent. Look, there's the ninth floor... And the eighth floor... And finally the first floor. The door is open. You're in a safe place where no one can hurt you. Do you understand? Now let's go back to the day your husband, javier, died. Tell me what you saw. I saw javier get shot... Wait. Wait, no. that's not right. I was too far behind. I didn't see sam shoot javy. take your clothes off. What is it, robin? what are you remembering? I saw other people, but he made it impossible to get away. I'm a trained marksman for the organization. I could shoot those hikers right where they're standing. I've killed a lot of people, a couple more won't matter. go on, robin. Tell me what you remember. You know, I'm a crack shot. So I would think really hard before trying to run. We were never lost, were we? That first night or even now. You knew exactly where we were. Everything that you've said has been a lie. Hey, go clean that blood off yourself. oh... Hey, come here. No. Take your clothes off. Please don't make me do this. Take your clothes off. Yeah. baby, I'm so... I'm so glad you're here with me. That you wanna be here with me. that was, that was the first time he raped me. go on. It's safe here. No one can hurt you. He took me to the middle of nowhere. it was filthy with garbage everywhere. He made me do horrible things... Things that I've never done with javier. And, and he made me do it over and over and over again for days. He wanted me. That's why javier died, because of me. He wanted to leave, but I-I made him stay. How could I let him do those things to me? This was not your fault, robin. You didn't do anything to make this happen. There are evil people in the world. You just had the misfortune of meeting one of them. Javier, I just had the strangest dream. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. We're, uh... All alone in these big, dark woods. Me and you, miles and miles. Me and you alone in the woods forever. And if you ran into those woods, they'll just gobble you up. "he maketh me to lie down in green pastures..." I used to be religious myself, but god gave up on me a long time ago. I don't think that's true. I've killed too many people for god to look kindly on me. Killing people is all I was trained to do. You can still change, there's always time. Why are you crying? I miss my husband. I don't wanna hear about that. You should be getting over that by now. You know, there are little doors in the human mind that you can open them and, and close them whenever you want. One day all the doors are gonna open in my mind and I'm gonna go crazy. I really hope you're not there when it happens, robin. You're such a sweet girl. Come here. You're shivering. I was trapped in the woods with a mad man. It's a classic case of brainwashing. Brainwashing, as in what? Kgb? Chinese military? Secret ops? No, actually, I think I misspoke. The term stockholm syndrome is more appropriate in this case. For her own survival, robin rivera began to identify with her husband's killer to the point where she was so in his thrall that he was able to implant false memories in her brain. Which is why she failed the lie detector. I should've put that together. Well, at the time you couldn't understand the extent of his reach. Once they got to the campsite, robin, having been emotionally, physically and sexually abused by her captor, was totally open to any suggestion sam turner put in her brain, especially because she couldn't bear the reality that sam killed javier in order to possess her. And then, finally, he offered her the promise of a reward. and what kind of reward would that be? The most basic reward there is, her life. Ugh... So, I have a witness who heard her husband being shot to death, but who was brainwashed, somehow, by the murderer into saying it was an accident. I got bupkis so far on forensics, although the state crime lab is taking a look at the gun and some tissue samples from javier. And to top it all off, my suspect is a drifter with no known address, who's out in the wind. Sounds like you got your work cut out for you. Yes, I do. But we got the truth on our side and that's always worth fighting for. I just gotta find a way to prove it. But I think if robin is willing to testify... We're off to the races. And now I have the harder job of calling celeste johnson and telling her what really happened to her daughter. It's what robin wanted. I don't think she can face talking with her mother quite yet. yes. Yes, I-I, I understand. I'll give her some space and let her come to me when she's ready. if she wants to testify, I, I'll support her. hey. Heard you folks are looking for me. Ma'am, this is my lawyer, ed hargrove. I'm sure you've heard of him. My client and I would like a word with sheriff watkins, please. Sheriff, sam turner and his lawyer are here to see you. he wants to talk, let's talk. - Follow me. - Interrogation room? Really? What are we doing in here? I thought we'd have more privacy in here. I could leave the door open if it makes you feel better. Now, it's come to my client's attention that robin rivera is slandering him in the court of public opinion. I don't think that's so. Has she not been telling people that my client kidnapped her, held her hostage, murdered her husband? If that's not slander, then what do you call it? Listen, my friends in town are telling me people are talking. Just like I said to mr. Hargrove, I just wanna clear this up before things get out of hand. I don't know what robin's playing at, but she saw the whole thing. You know, s-she knows it's an accident. Sheriff watkins, are you aware that my client and mrs. Rivera had sexual relations? Look, I believe she regrets what happened and has concocted this whole story so that she looks like the victim instead of a lying... If you're saying that robin had comfort sex with your client hours after her husband was killed, well, that's just horse... How dare you walk in here and speak this way about a young woman who your client tortured and abused? Robin rivera recanted her story. She says your client killed her husband in cold blood and I believe her. Sheriff watkins, please, listen to me. I did not murder javier. Robin was upset and she ran off into the woods and I went after her, we got lost. One thing led to another and, and things just happened between us. So that's why you kept her in the woods for days with her dead husband's body? I passed the lie-detector test, ma'am. What else am I supposed to do to prove my innocence? And speaking of lie-detector tests, did I hear right that your witness failed hers? Mom, no, I need to do this alone. leave it to my wife to burn water. Who burns water? Hey, babe, hey, can you hand me those? oh, my god. robin? I got worried. Everything okay? He was here. Sam was outside. Did you see him? no. We have to tell the sheriff. Do you... Do you think that I'm a bad person? A bad person? Oh, ro-robin. How could I ever think that? You are a good person. He raped me, mom, and I couldn't stop him. I-I should've tried to fight him. I, I should've tried to run away, but I couldn't. I know. I know. I'm a terrible person. You are not a terrible person. You did nothing wrong. Do you hear me? If you'd fought him, he would've killed you. When someone violates you like that, it is never your fault. But I should've done something. You did. You survived. I can't testify, mom. I want to, for javier and for me, but... I just can't face him in court. But you told the sheriff. I know. But I just can't. I can't. He's dangerous, mom. He'll kill me and... I'm scared he'll kill you, too. celeste called. She claims robin saw sam at her apartment. Well, did celeste see him? No, but you're gonna wanna see this. It's from the state crime lab. celeste... we got the forensics and the autopsy back on javier. sam turner is a liar and we can prove it. There were no powder burns on the victim, so there was no way in heck that he was standing next to javier handing him the rifle when it discharged. We're issuing a warrant and we're gonna arrest him. And with this new evidence and robin's testimony, we're gonna put him away on the murder charge. Wait... What do you mean robin's decided not to testify? oh, my god. Oh, come on. You've always liked a nice picnic. I got you all your favorites, including marshmallows. So have you given anymore thought to what you wanna do? I don't know. Robin, it's been three months, and no sign of sam turner. I don't understand. How can they not find him by now? he could be in timbuktu, for all I know, by now. School semester is starting soon and I bet if you called mike at the convenience store, he'd give you your old job back. - Mom, please. - Something's got to give. You are young and you have your whole life ahead of you. You can't just hide. Well, actually, I've been thinking and I can't really afford my apartment, so thought it'd be good for me to stay here with you for a while. And I already talked to mike at thrifty mart. He is getting me an afternoon shift tomorrow. - Oh! That's wonderful! - Mm-hmm. Now, about school. Alright. Alright. I'll get a catalog of courses. I happen to have a copy right here. - You're the worst. - Yeah, I know. That's why you love me. what's so funny? I could've opened any page, but... This is the course javier wanted me to sign up for. Nursing? You're gonna make a great nurse. Oh, finally alone together. - No. - Hey, I'm your friend. I'm here to help. You know, if we want, we can just make this all go away. No. You did those things to me, I remember. No, I didn't do anything to you. - I saved your life. - You killed javy. Oh, that. That was an accident. You saw it. I handed him the gun and it went off. No. yes. And you raped me. No, I didn't. You were upset and I tried to comfort you. And things happened between us because we have a connection. Do you hear me? We have a connection. You're lying. Are you sure about that, robin? I mean, I'm the one that passed the lie-detector test. help! Help! bastard's stalking her. We got to get robin to a safe place. How could we have missed him? He's been here the whole time. what do you wanna do, chief? Alright, we have to protect robin. Come on. why can't we just stay at the house? no one knows we're here, robin. The chief said it would be safer. it's not right. We can't let him intimidate her. I'm gonna have deputies watching this room 24/7. He is not gonna get anywhere near you. how long will we have to stay here? At least until we nail the son of a bitch. And if he goes to trial and is acquitted? Well... We'll cross that bridge if we come to it. Look, I am absolutely convinced that sam turner is a merciless killer, but we're gonna just have to hope that the state sees that he's guilty, too. Of course, he's guilty. I'm just... I'm so tired of everyone questioning it. - It's the truth. - This isn't about the truth. It's about what a judge and jury believe. - And without you... - testifying? No. I-I can't do that. He'll kill me, he'll kill my mom and... Then he'll just be out there, in his filthy shed by the river. Filthy shed? Okay, wait a minute. I got a hunch. call fish and game about decommission depots by the river. The two of you just sit tight, okay? We need to go search the woods, crack of dawn we're on the hunt. I'm freezing. do I feel hot? - Well, you're burin' up. - Oh, I'm sick. I'm sick, aren't I? I'm gonna die. Oh, god, I'm gonna die! Not if we go to town and get you some medical help. Oh, no, no. They'll lock me up and throw away the key. no. We'll do what we can here. Um, you're shivering, so... You're such a good person, robin. You're too good for all this. You're a good man. you-you've taken care of me, kept me safe. Yeah. That is true. you would've died without me. I would've died in these woods without you. and I promise you, I promise you, I don't remember it, but killin' javier was an accident. I swear! you have to believe me. Okay? I'm dying! Okay... A dying man has to tell the truth. - Really? - Yeah. when we get back, I'll-I'll tell the sheriff the truth, that-that-that it was an accident. that you-you didn't mean it. - You'd do that for me? - Of course. - Like you said, it was... - It was an accident. It was a terrible, terrible accident. an accident no one could help, because I know you would never try to hurt me or javier. No. I'll... Never. You're my friend. You're... You like me, and I like you. And you saved my life. robin, can you say it again? I like hearing you say it. It was an accident. Everything that happened to javier, getting killed... - Gun just went off. - Oh, it just went off. I-I mean, you were standing right there. You saw it all. I would never hurt you or javier. You heard the gunshot and you screamed, ran to javier, but there was nothin' either of us could do. I screamed, I heard the gunshot. It was... It was a terrible, terrible accident. Now we just have to get back to the city and, and you tell the sheriff what you saw. - Hm? - Hm. Why am I such a coward? Javy would be ashamed of me. Being afraid doesn't make you a coward. Robin, you have no control over what happens in that courtroom. But if you decide to testify, your only job is to go in there and tell the truth, your truth. That's all you have to do. Take your power back, baby. sam turner! Stay away from the rifle. You're under arrest for the murder of javier rivera. You know, I'm gonna sue you for false arrest, brutality, slander. my lawyer's gonna throw the book at you. You got nothin' on me, sheriff. Turn around. You know, I'll be out in a few weeks. You can't protect robin forever. ah... Come on! look at this. Alright, cordon it off. I want forensics up here now. hi, baby. I miss you so much. I, I wish you were here so I could talk to you for real. You always knew the right thing to do. I want people to see that sam turner is a liar. But I'm just so scared how he... He thought that I was weak, that I was a victim and could do whatever he wanted to me. But that was a mistake. I survived for a reason, for me and for you... And the life we never got to have together. But I... I want to fight. I was wrong. You will always have a place in my family, robin. Forgive me. There's nothing to forgive. I loved javier... I need to make sure the man who hurt him... Pays. what's goin' on? I wanted to let you know I've decided to testify at the trial today. hey, how are you gonna do that? Poor little robin, you can't get your story straight. That's where you're wrong. I've got my story straight. And you know what, there's a happy ending, 'cause it puts you in jail for the rest of your life. I am so proud of you! Yes! Are you okay? I'm more than okay, mom. I'm ready to live life.
