There's nothing like playin' the New Orleans jazz and heritage festival. Nothing in the world. J“ who came to party? J“ All the best musicians from around the world descend upon the city. 7,000 musicians on 14 stages over eight days. How y'all doin' out there, jazz fest? We all know the jazz fest is a place where you go and see legends. Somebody! Way in the back, back there, say, "yeah!" Yeah! Wow! This is the real stuff. Greetings, New Orleans! I can just tell you one word: Magical. Are you still havin' a good time, y'all? To play jazz fest is like being a part of the playoffs. Jazz fest meant that you made it. Everywhere we play around the world, people go, "I saw you at jazz fest." Are you ready? Are you ready? Whoo! You might call itjazz, but you know, you got rock, you got R&B, you got soul. Well, it never was only jazz. I love looking at the names of bands I've never heard of that I wanna go see. You hear Terence Blanchard, then turn around, you might hear Tony Bennett. You crazy? And then you can go and see 93-year-old dooky chase cook her famous gumbo z'herbes in your face! Whoo, ooh! It's kind of like havin' the city of New Orleans in New Orleans. Music and cultures, sounds and flavors. The air is thick, and not with just humidity, it's thick with culture. That's jazz fest, like, there ain't no festival like this one, I'm telling you. Life is happening at a high frequency for these two weeks. You're going to the jazz fest, you're going to a New Orleans party. The world's greatest, you know, backyard barbecue. The most kick-ass party in the world. I'm in. We're gonna go out there and jam. We'll see y'all out there tonight. George wein, the creator of the Newport jazz festival, he was brought to New Orleans and said New Orleans has something that no one else in the world can ever claim, and that's the birthright ofjazz. This is called "wrap your troubles in dreams." I got a call from someone with the hotel corporation of america, and they wanted me to come down here in 1962 to do a Newport-type festival. And of course, you couldn't do a festival in '62 because of the Jim crow. They couldn't have white musicians and African musicians on the stage at the same time. And I was married to an African-American lady, my wife, Joyce. So I said, look, you know, maybe things will change. 80 things changed, and they called me to come back. The heritage, the backgrounds ofjazz, started right here in New Orleans. And so I just feel that the way we're going to create a festival down here that the whole world will come to will be to really hit the heritage of what the people of Louisiana and New Orleans have. New Orleans has the only really unique culture in america that belongs to itself, and I said the festival must be a reflection of New Orleans and Louisiana culture. I remember the very first jazz festival. George wein came in town and I was asked if I would identify musicians that should be on the festival. So I went to everybody that I knew and helped to spearhead in the direction of George. Ellis was working across the street in al hirt's club, and we'd hang out at nights. And then I found quint Davis. Quint was a kid. He knew nothing about festivals, but he was very excited about doing anything that had to do with music and had to do with New Orleans music. I mean, I don't know, it's like if you were a kid and you collected baseball cards, and you get a call saying, "the world series is here, we need you to come to yankee stadium and pitch one of the games." George would just trust you. I just took quint and threw him in the water and let him swim. It was to see if he could either drown me or I could be of use. I insisted in the first year, only New Orleans groups, or Louisiana groups. That brought mahalia Jackson, who was born here, and Duke Ellington. And that was the first festival. There you go. Here she is, ladies and gentlemen. Mahalia Jackson. I wanna show 'em how they supposed to sing up north, and where George wein came from, you know what I mean. He is a great king and he's done such marvelous work in bringing this real American music to the people all over. But he's down here in the briar patch. We gon' show him where it was created for, and who is the author ofjazz, Louisiana! New Orleans, give yourself a big hand, and see me Friday night! Thank you so much! Yeah! When jazz fest started, it was like we were presenting this culture to the world. There's cajun music, there's blues, there's funk, there's gospel, that was the original festival. There was a lot of reasons that everybody thought we would fail. One of 'em was bringing Latin people and black people and cajun people all together at the same place. And I was like, "well, everybody eats and everybody dances, so if we can get people together and see what they eat and see what they dance to, you know, I think that could work." When it was all put together in one place, it was stunning to the local people. You know, they were amazed at themselves and they felt a tremendous pride. And I knew that we had something special. Today will forever be the first day of the 50th New Orleans jazz and heritage festival. It rained today, it rained hard. Rain is an element of our planet. We are a planet of elements, like the earth, like the wind, like the fire. Those elements are here with us today! Earth, wind & fire! J“ hey, hey, hey, heyj' is there a party over here? J“ hey, hey, hey, heyj“ is there a party over there? New Orleans, where's the party, y'all? Where's the party, y'all? Whoo! J“ do you remember 21st night of September? J“ j“ love was changing the mind of pretenders j“ j“ while chasing the clouds away j“ j“ our hearts were ringing j“ j“ in the key that our souls were singing j“ j“ as we danced through the night remember j“ j“ how we knew love was here to stay j“ j“ come on, everybody, sing! J“ j“ hey, hey, heyj“ j“ say, do you remember? J“ j“ dancing in September j“ j“ never was a cloudy day j“ you're playing in New Orleans, which has a tremendous amount of history for music, and you feel it when you're on stage. J“ see you only blue talk and love, remember j“ j“ how we knew love was here to stay j“ it's great to be in a place where the music is still alive and evolving. J“ only blue talk and love, remember j“ j“ knew love was here to stay j“ j“ hey, hey, heyj“ j“ say, do you remember? J“ j“ dancing in September j“ j“ never was a cloudy day j“ Earth, wind & fire has lost nothing. They're fantastic performers, and it was their 50th anniversary too. We are coming up on 50 years, and I have to tell you, it's been quite an adventure. Party people in the house, let's jump, come on! Fifty years, you know, we've probably come here most of our 50. So, wow, as an artist and a festival, we go way back. J“ do you remember never was a cloudy day j“ it's a blessing to be able to still do music this long, on this level, and there will be a lot of young people today that probably are first discovering earth, wind & fire. All of New Orleans, party people, now scream! J“ whoa j“ One thing about the festival is, it's handmade. It's still handmade, all of it. It's what we call blades of grass. You go somewhere and there's nothing there. And you have to build everything. Happy jazz fest! How y'all doin'? Everybody needs a chair! Get your chair here. Every year I come, I look, I say, "I can't believe this." It's like we've created our own world here. We create a little city out there for seven days. On a really big day, if we have close to 100,000 people, we're the sixth-largest city in Louisiana. Mdou moctar from Niger! Welcome to New Orleans jazz and heritage festival. Please hold your own ticket and open all bags, which are subject to search. When your physical body is at jazz fest, you're gonna hear something playing within 500 feet. And when you're walking to get your crab-stuffed beignets, you're gonna see the flash of the lively feathers, and you're gonna walk, you're gonna see what happens, and so the exploration that we sort of lose in this digital era, that exploration is back when you're there and you're on your own two feet. Are you ready? Let's go! That's something that is inside of all of us, like, we want to explore, we wanna be surprised. And in the most celebratory of ways, there's something around the corner at jazz fest that you physically can't help but run into, thanks in large part to the way the site is laid out. You can't walk from one stage to another without seeing another stage. And in the meantime, whether you want to or not, you're gonna experience something that your computer wouldn't have put in your feed. There's wide gaps, and there's enormous difference in tempos and style and delivery. But it's all under this beautiful umbrella, this gorgeous music and cultural village that is created with a single-minded purpose: Good music, culture, food, by way of jazz fest. Cold beer, Rose! Cold beer, Rose! You're listening to 90.3, kexp. An extremely special day here, 'cause with me is the legendary preservation hall jazz band. And if you're all ready, take it away. It's called preservation hall. Day and night, the purists come and hear jazz, played by old-timers like sweet Emma. New Orleans has a long history of music halls. Every neighborhood had an entertainment space that was attached to the church, and that is where weekend dances would take place. My father and my mother created preservation hall, and because of the energy and the love that he and my mother gave to the community, they became an important piece of the community. I don't know a New Orleans before jazz fest. I was born in 1971. I'm actually a jazz fest baby. I was born January 26. You know, count back nine months, it's pretty much jazz fest, you know? I'm not the only one. There's a lot of January babies. "Preservation," to me, means "protection." The name "preservation hall" really captured what they were doing at that moment, which was protecting this community of musicians, and that was jazz fest, this idea to create preservation hall for New Orleans music and New Orleans culture. Everybody! One more time! Hands up! - Jazz fest! - New Orleans! In the early plantation days, there was a need for entertainment of one sort or another. And after slaves had worked for long periods of time, it made sense to a benevolent master, I suppose, to let them entertain themselves. Well, they had a very definite pulse, which was African in origin. What makes New Orleans unique, musically and culturally, the slaves, they were able to praise and worship and to beat their drum in Congo square. The drum calls in the spirit. They were allowed to do that. They were allowed to worship and call in their god. And that's where we get all these rhythms and these rhymes. That drum has just carried on from generation to generation to generation. That's what's kept the music and the culture so thick and so rich. Jazz fest 2019! Give it up, y'all, for Mr. Julian Addison on the drums! When that bass drum start, it's like the heartbeat. When the tuba starts pumpin', that's that blood flowin' through the body. So once the blood starts to flow with the heartbeat, it takes the kidney, which is the snare drum to push you fonnard, and the horns come in, which is everything else. We start movin' and pumpin' and give the audience that vibe and energy, we see they enjoyin' it, that makes us enjoy it more, so we give them more. So it's exchange, exchange, exchange. There are people who come from around the world to look for drummers from New Orleans because there's a certain beat that drummers play here that no other drummer is able to play, and that second line beat with that extra beat to the drums, it's hard to teach someone. They have to feel it in order to be able to execute it. The second one is the syncopated beat that's central to all New Orleans music. Second line band initially was done for funerals. Was to march real slow on the way to the funeral. That's how you lay the dead away, with a band. First of all, the jazz funeral, who wouldn't want one, right? J“ dearly walkin' close to thee j“ j“ let it be j“ j“ dear lord, let it be j“ to be honored in such a way, where musicians from all genres of New Orleans and Louisiana music, we all come together. We put on our best dress to say goodbye to our loved one. J“ I'll be satisfied just as long j“ we march, we honor you, we tilt our hats. We rare back. J“ dear, dearly walkin' close to thee j“ we have a period of mourning, but right after that, we celebrate the life and remember the good things. We leave the cemetery... And we strike up what we consider a lively number, to make the people forget their griefs and their sorrows and take their minds off of what has just happened. It brings the community back together. It ties the person's legacy to our community. That's the celebration of a jazz funeral. In america, I don't think any city has a better relationship with death than New Orleans. It goes hand in hand. The suffering and the joy are right along next to each other. In New Orleans, there's a lot of what they call "'oie de vivre," joy of living. It's kind of like the idea of enjoying life with everything you can while you can. It's celebration almost in defiance of the odds. We celebrate when a child is born and we also celebrate when someone leaves the earth. There's a deep spirituality in that. That's what it's all about. It's not, "they're gone," but, "they're still with us in spirit." The resurrection of spirit and will, and a choice to live and live with great expression. It is now audience-participation time! Did ya bring your handkerchief or your napkin? For the benefit of those folks who have never participated in an audience before, we are about to do what we call the outdoor second line! And I want you to get out your handkerchiefs, umbrellas, napkins, hats, whatever you got. And I want you to wave your handkerchief or napkins in the air. And I want you to put your backfield in motion. I was lucky to be born at a time when music was very, very prevalent and they used music to get over everything. When you were sad, you sung, when you were happy, you sung. Are you ready out there? Are you ready out there? Play one! We're one of the few port cities where all the immigrants who have music to share, we intertwine it within the music that we're playing. There is no such thing as separation of culture in New Orleans. It's all blended together. J“ yeah, my spyboy told your spyboy j“ j“ sitting by the fire j“ j“ my spyboy told your spyboy j“ j“ I'm gonna set your flags on fire j“ j“ talkin' 'bout hey now hey now j“ j“ hey now hey now iko iko a nae j“ j“ jock-a-mo fee lo an da de j“ j“ jock-a-mo fee na ne j“ my very first jazz fest was in 1974, and I have not missed one since that time. J“ anybody say hey, hey, hey j“ j“ hey, pocky way j“ j“ yeah, hey, hey, hey hey, pocky way j“ j“ right on j“ j“ uptown rulerj“ j“ just get on down j“ j“ oh, boogie on j“ Everywhere you walk in New Orleans, you're walking in history. Jazz, it's our music. You know, it's indigenous to the United States. New Orleans is sacred ground ofjazz. Ellis marsalis himself is a great jazz master, but he's also a teacher, and his greatest teaching was mentoring his four sons. We're talking about wynton marsalis, branford marsalis, Jason and delfeayo marsalis. I have six sons, four of which are musicians. I remember my first jazz festival, it was 50 years ago. We would go every year, and some years my dad played. I wouldn't really go to hear my dad. I hear him all the time. Jazz fest was the first time I actually met miles Davis. It was weird. I knew who he was, but a part of me didn't really care because I was maybe 8 years old. So, you know, he signed his picture for me, and I think I was running around and dropped it. I went to the first jazz fest. I remember there was shrimp in the jambalaya. I remember how soulful it was. I remember walking into a tent and James booker was there, and I had no idea who he was. He had the patch over his eye and he looked up at me, and I just ran out of the tent. My earliest musical influences was my family, from my father to my older brothers, because I was actually listening to the records that they were putting out. I don't remember the first time I played at jazz fest, but I suspect it was my dad throwing wynton and I out there because he believes that everybody should get fed to the lions. He thinks that it makes you a better player. He's right about it. But I had fun playing with dad. I can remember playing at the jazz fest when I was in high school. That was like a highlight of the year, every year we would... We couldn't wait to play in the tent, andlwas14, 15,16. That was a big deal. It was funny, even back then, when we walked onto the stage, he ceased being my dad. He was the leader of the group. On the bandstand, it's about trying to make the music sound good. Can't remember the last time all five of us played, we almost never do it. This may be the last time that we ever do it. Dad's 84. It's not gonna happen a lot more. This one in particular is one where we're all like, "yeah, we need to do this." It's nice to be wanted without being in the picture in the post office. Yeah, there's no one style of music. Jazz started in the churches down here around New Orleans. Each afternoon there's gonna be six hours of music, and we're only charging two dollars for adults and a dollar for kids. To have a festival in the home field of the sacred ground ofjazz is to bring people in to the very wide umbrella ofjazz. So much stylistically has been borrowed from jazz. I think jazz can welcome all of its children back to its festival. Rock, soul, singer-songwriters, blues, all of them can come on back to, in a way, the parents of this music. J“ tell everybody b.B. King's in town j“ j“ got a dollar and a quarter just rarin' to clown j“ j“ but don't let nobody play me cheap j“ j“ I got 50 cents more that I'm gonna keep j“ j“ 80 let the good times roll j“ j“ let the good times roll j“ j“ I don't care if you're young or old j“ j“ get together, let the good times roll j“ It's no wonder that jazz was born in this area because the people are so enthusiastic. In other words, musically, they know it and they are part of it. They produce it and they, I don't know, they have that certain little something that feeds a guy like me, that makes me, oh, gosh, it nourishes me. J“ you got me trained to sit on a stage j“ j“ not show my rage for you j“ j“ got my love, it's not enough I need to prove it to you j“ j“ what's the difference what's the difference j“ j“ what's the difference in me now? J“ j“ I can change, I can change I can change j“ I think we do everything from blues to some of it's tinged with R&B and rock 'n' roll. J“ I'm on my way out! J“ j“ turn it on you turn it on you j“ j“ I turn it on you, yeah j“ j“ you're bulletproof j“ j“ turn it on you I turn it on you j“ j“ turn it on you but you're bulletproof j“ hello, jazz fest! Oh, bulletproof, baby! I've been such a huge fan of New Orleans blues, and, you know, music in general. That's why I came here. There's a soul in the city. It's got angst. It's got a bite to it. Blues is a universal language. It goes really deep, goes to deep waters. It's at the heart ofjazz and rock 'n' roll and so much else. And for that reason, the blues speaks to people, and you can't help but think about that with New Orleans and the history of the city. I think it's part of what makes it so special. The culture here has been the anchor for me. It's the first time I heard jazz and R&B and second line, was in the quarter, and I never got over that. You know, the rhythm is so infectious. J“ woke up this mornin' feelin' round for my shoes j“ j“ you know I have them mean ol' walkin' blues j“ j“ woke up this mornin' look 'round for my shoes j“ j“ you know I have them mean, mean ol' walkin' blues j“ j“ some people try to tell me the blues ain't so bad j“ j“ but it's the meanest thing I ever had j“ j“ some people tell lord, the blues ain't bad j“ j“ but it's the meanest thing I believe I ever had j“ J“ gonna run to the ocean j“ I started out playing trumpet when I was 10 years old. Came at the guitar with a different perspective, more so as a wind instrument player. Learning how to take a breath when you play to fit that into your melodic sensibility. J“ woke up this mornin' feelin' 'round for my shoes j“ j“ you know I had them mean ol' walkin' blues j“ j“ woke up this mornin' feelin' 'round for my shoes j“ j“ you know I had them mean, mean ol' walkin' blues j“ j“ I got to walk around j“ j“ I got to walk around j“ people keep coming back for a reason, you know? And not only that, I mean, this happens all the time, people move here. Some never leave. There's something about here that you tap into that soulful quality. You can't help but get some of that, you know, either in the air or the humidity or whatever. Cold beer, cold beer, cold beer! The general idea of being in the sun for seven or eight hours and only eating fried, cream-based food, that is a distinctly New Orleans concept. Let's rock and roll. And we're cooking cracklins! Cracklins is the skin, fat and meat of a hog. I think the food is a little bit more important than people really understand. It's not just New Orleans food, it's the food from all over the state of Louisiana. Now, if the music wasn't there, I won't say that the same number of people would be there, but a lot of people would be there to eat this food. Best food in the world! We sell praline beignets, crab meat beignets, and the calas, which is a rice fritter. Oh, we have 50,000 serving plus. You get a beignet, you get a beignet, you get a beignet! Nah, I'm just kiddin'. Whoo, ooh! Shrimp remoulade po' boy. We'll go through a couple thousand pounds of chicken, couple thousand pounds of shrimp. We tend to gain about ten pounds at jazz fest. I think all of our arteries get clogged that day. If it's cooked and it looks right and it tastes good, I'll eat it. And consequently, I'm paying a price for that. The cochon de iait has been to the New Orleans jazz fest for 50 years. We move about a couple thousand sandwiches on a busy day. I started to retain water. And the doctor that I saw, he said, "welcome to New Orleans." We have a gourmet plate, and on that plate is a crawfish stack, an oyster Patty and crawfish beignet with a white remoulade sauce. I love to go get the stuffed crabs. My favorite is the bread pudding. - Jambalaya. - Trout amandine. Try some alligator, try some boudin. We do a crawfish remoulade salad, and also we sell boudin balls. Which is fried. So we go through almost 200 cases of balls a weekend. Don't leave the fest without your balls! You know? Let me tell you, I tried something that blew my mind, which was fried oysters. I hadn't had that yet. I was like, whoa. And this dish could get you in some trouble. You eat too many of those, you might not make it on-stage. Now, for everybody that's represented here today, I wanna let y'all know I've been very blessed to be able to travel the whole world, and I get a chance to be a part of something that's... Something that brings everybody together. Something that makes the United States of America the United States of America, not the divided states of america. Doesn't matter if you're black, white, pink, purple, orange, hispanic, Asian. We all speak music here today. Why is New Orleans so special? Because they know exactly where they're from. They know their roots. They love their culture. They represent it in their music, in their food, in their style. And that's why I feel that jazz fest in New Orleans has that magic. Now I need y'all to help me out with this one. And it says... J“ the roof, the roof the roof is on fire! J“ - j“ we don't need no water, let that... j“ -J“ motherfucker burn! J“ j“ burn, motherfucker, burn! J“ J“ Mr. Worldwide to infinity you know the roof on fire j“ j“ we gon' boogie oogie oogie jiggle, wiggle and dance j“ j“ like the roof on fire j“ j“ we gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out j“ j“ like the roof on fire j“ j“ now baby give a Booty naked take off all your clothes j“ j“ and light the roof on fire j“ j“ I tell her, tell her baby, baby baby, baby, baby, babyj“ j“ baby, baby, baby, I'm on fire j“ j“ I tell her baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, babyj“ j“ baby, baby, I'm a fireball j“ let's go!

J“ being a Miami boy, my family's from Cuba. I'm a first-generation Cuban-American. The connection between New Orleans, Cuba, and Miami, it's almost like our own little Bermuda triangle that we've got going on. So we all basically love and stand for the same things, but it's art and music and food. J“ baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, I'm on fire j“ j“ tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby where we goin', girl? J“ such a beautiful thing when you make a mixture of so many different cultures, what you come up with. We call it una paella, they call it a gumbo, but it's basically the same concept. J“ we 're taking it, we 're taking it we 're taking it down j“ that's what jazz fest is about, you know, just all kind of different music and cultures, sounds and flavors. It brings everybody together. So that is why, to be able to be a part of something like this, is something that's so powerful. J“ we 're bringing it, we 're bringing it we 're bringing it back j“ j“ fireball! J“ let's go! That's right! Get some! J“ fireball j“ J“ I tell her baby, baby, baby baby, babyj“ j“ baby, baby, baby, baby, baby I'm on fire j“ j“ I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, I'm a fireball j“ I would tell anybody, you know, when you have a chance to come to New Orleans, also make sure you have an extra few days to go down to Lafayette. People think swamp people, they're in New Orleans. No, they in the swamp, you know, and you gotta go out and check 'em out. Get out in the swamp. Well, I think that's always a good thing to do, just to see it and get a feel of it. A lot of music that ends up in New Orleans comes from the country. It comes from, you know, rural areas. I'm from eunice, Louisiana, and I play cajun music. It's a very small, rural agricultural town. It has a lot of very old families that live there. In fact, my children are the seventh generation living on the same land, which is not uncommon in our area. People are very deeply rooted into their culture and have maintained the language, and the music, and the way of life. Why change? We have the best of everything. The repertoire that we play, we've been playing it ever since we were children. I would call it a homemade music, and it's straight from the heart. It's very rhythmic music, and it was developed for one reason: To dance to. You had to get them dancin', and that was what we always strive to do. I mean, the seats at the places were facin' the dance floor, not facin' the band, because the dancin' is the show, where people would dance all around in a circle. People generally don't know the difference between cajun and zydeco music. First of all, one's basically Caucasian, one is basically black. Cajun music has a fiddle, an accordion, a triangle, guitar, bass and drums, sometimes pedal steel. And it does this whole body of traditional cajun songs. Now, zydeco, zydeco is like a freight train going through a tunnel. J“ it's been such a long time j“ j“ since you said "I want ya" j“ j“ it's been such a long time j“ in zydeco music, you've got an electric accordion that's like that big. Mother of Pearl coming down with your name in it. J“ no matter how you feel no matter how you do j“ j“ no matter how you act no matter what you buy j“ j“ no matter how it is no matter where you're from j“ j“ don't you know that I'm comin' right home to you j“ Then you always have a frottoir. The frottoir is the metal-like washboard that you wear on the front over your shoulder, and there are points in the song where you break it down, and it's just the accordion and the frottoir, and the two of them are just, phew. Old school. Jazz fest is like where everybody wants to come to see the talent of Louisiana, of New Orleans, the surrounding areas. If you play music and you from Louisiana, this is where you wanna be. My father's real name is alton rubin senior, but most people know him as rockin' dopsie. J“ goodbye, Joe, me gotta go me, oh, my, oh j“ j“ me gotta go on the bayou j“ Rockin' dopsie was in the generation with Clifton chenier, and he called himself the king and he wore a crown. And just rocked the place, just a rocket ship of energy. J“ dressed in style go hog wild and dance j“ j“ son of a gun, we 're gonna have fun on the bayou j“ j“ jambalaya, crawfish pie, fi/é gumbo j“ j“ for tonight I'm gonna see my ma Cher ami-o j“ j“ pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o j“ j“ son of a gun, we 're gonna have fun on the bayou j“ one more time, one more time! Jimmy buffett is very, very special to this festival. I think you've earned a ticket to margaritaville by standing here all day, are you ready? Let's go! He's been responsible for drawing more people to the New Orleans jazz and heritage festival than maybe anyone else. J“ nibblin' on sponge cake j“ j“ watchin' the sun bake j“ j“ all of you parrot heads here at jazz fest j“ j“ strummin' my six-string j“ j“ on my front-porch swing j“ I been to a bunch of 'em, but I gotta say this looks like the best! J“ wastin' away again in margaritaville j“ j“ searchin' for my lost shaker of salt j“ j“ salt! Salt! Salt! J“ j“ some people claim that there's a woman to blame j“ who's got it? Who's got it? J“ but I know j“ j“ it's nobody's fault j“ I grew up on the Gulf coast. I was an 18-year-old virgin jesuit altar boy, and I came to New Orleans to not be that. J“ I come here each season j“ we couldn't get to California, so we kinda hippied out right here in New Orleans. J“ but it's a real beauty j“ j“ all these Louisiana cuties j“ I know I got a few that slid over from Mississippi and got a clue! Everything about the songs I heard, the melodies and the rhythms that I love, came out of here. J“ ...Again in margaritaville j“ looking good! J“ searchin' for my lost shaker of salt j“ j“ salt! Salt! Salt! J“ j“ some people claim that there's a woman to blame j“ j“ but I know j“ j“ this could be my fault j“ maybe. When I was headlining the bayou room on bourbon street, making $150 a week, I thought I'd made it. Cinco de Mayo! Muchas gracias, mis amigos! I couldn't wait to sing "margaritaville" on cinco de Mayo, goddamn! And Joseph Campbell said you gotta have a little mythology in your life, and I grew up in it, and so I know that it is absolutely a part of everything that I've done, from writing shows to writing songs, comes out of being a child of the mardi gras. Every year, the city takes on new life in preparation for its carnival time. Mardi gras is a day when people lose their inhibitions and throw modesty to the wind. New Orleans has what we call mardi gras. Because we have mardi gras, we have these huge school marching bands. Every kid in high school is given an instrument and taught to play these songs and march a couple miles through New Orleans. In how many places does a kid, in his 13s, 15s, 16s, want a trombone? That's happening in New Orleans. I saw that as a child, I saw that brass band, those jazz musicians was always clean. Everybody shook their hand. Family seemed to live a little better than the average family in the 'hood. Not a moment that I didn't wake up that I didn't want to be a musician, 'cause that's what I was surrounded around. Let me hear you say... J“ I can do bad by myself j“ j“ said I don't need nobody else j“ j“ I can do bad by myself j“ j“ well, I don't need nobody else j“ that's the thing about jazz fest. I'm this little kid from the 'hood, you know, I just always wanted to play music. Start clappin' right now! J“ early, early in the morning j“ to be a mardi gras Indian, we are a bunch of grown men walking around and saying we're the prettiest. You wanna be the best, but at the same time, you don't wanna lose why we do it. We do it to pay homage. The mardi gras Indian tradition is a combination of two cultures coming together, both native American and African American. During the time of the underground railroad, a lot of slaves that were trying to escape, the Indians allowed them to seek shelter, and they took them into their tribes. And the evolution of that is today we have the mardi gras Indians paying homage to the history of that. You could walk around on mardi gras looking for an Indian and never find one. But the jazz fest gives us another day to showcase the suits on a much grander scale. J“ I'm just your fool, can't help myself j“ j“ I love you, baby, and no one else j“ j“ I ain't crazy, you are my baby j“ j“ I'm just your fool j“ j“ I'm just your fool, I must confess j“ j“ I love you, baby honey, I take your mess j“ j“ I ain't iyin', no use jivin' j“ j“ I'm just your fool j“ Thank you! From day one, and we started with a very small gospel tent... But the pastors said, "oh, no, our choirs are not going out somewhere where people are wearing shorts and drinkin' beer." But then as they realized that it was spreading the word, people were getting it and feeling it, eventually everyone came. And it's grown and grown and grown. Oh, yes! Jesus is on the main line. Call him up and tell him what you want. I mean, we have over 1000 gospel singers alone. J“ everybody, everybody everybody rejoice j“ j“ rejoice with me rejoice with me j“ j“ rejoice with me j“ in the south, all young people grow up in the church. Church mothers would always tell me, "if you don't use it for god... He'll take it away from you." J“ rejoice with me rejoice with me j“ The word "gospel" is the good news of Christ. And what better way to spread good news than music? -J“ I got a feelin' j“ -j“ got a fee/in'j“ j“ everything is gonna be all right j“ j“ oh, yeah j“ -j“ got a fee/in'j“ -j“ got a feelin" j“ There's something magical in the gospel tent. People that you wouldn't think are all drawn to it, they all go. Our gospel tent has exposed traditional church gospel music, which is a huge community in New Orleans, to more white people than anything in history. J“ all right j“ you'll find me at jazz fest in the gospel tent with tears running down my face, because the messages that are happening in there are about forgiveness, redemption, celebration and joy. J“ all right, all right j“ People are seeking acceptance and they're seeking forgiveness, and they find it here. J“ all right j“ Sit in the gospel tent for 45 minutes and watch what it do you. You go walkin', you come out and just throw your hands up, walkin' out like that, feeling the spirit is like... J“ something hit me from the crown of my head j“ j“ and went down to the sole of my feet j“ j“ and I started runnin' j“ j“ oh, yes, I did, now, nowj“ j“ I started clappin' my hands j“ j“ oh, yes, I did, nowj“ j“ I said I wasn't gonna tell nobody j“ A! Green is maybe the last ray Charles. He's one of the greatest rhythm and blues singers ever. J“ I told my father, I told my sister j“ j“ I told my brother, I been redeemed j“ j“ I been redeemed j“ And he is heavily tied to gospel. I mean, he is reverend al green, it's not a title. In Memphis, he's got a church. J“ there's the blood of the lamb and he's got all power j“ j“ power, power, powerj“ j'ohlj“ j“ power j“ you know, every Sunday he's there. This is what I call gospel. J“ let's stay together j“ - Somebody say yeah! - Yeah! - Somebody say yeah! - Yeah! Somebody way in the back, back there, say yeah! The return of al green. First public performance in seven years. Let's stay together. He was, like, reincarnated as himself in his own lifetime. Everybody sing. J“ whatever you want... j“ he was thrilled to be singing these songs again. J“ you make me feel so brand-new j“ j“ I want to spend my life with you j“ j“ let me say that since all right j“ -j“ since we been togetherj“ -j“ together, togetherj“ -j“ lovin' you forever j“ -j“ ever j“ j“ ls what I need j“ j“ oh, let me j“ J“ I 'ii never be untrue j“ everybody sing. J“ let's stay together j“ j“ lovin' you whether whether j“ -j“ whether times are j“ -j“ good or bad, happy or sad j“ what happens with a soul singer who has crossed over into secular music, they know how to come to that emotion because they've been in a congregation of people that, in a way, you sang at the foot of god. J“ whyj“ -j“ why do people break up? J“ -j“ break up, break up j“ -j“ turn around and make j“ -j“ make up j“ Which is why many of the greatest singers, from nat king Cole to Luther vandross to al green, have come out of the gospel experience. J“ say let's j“ j“ let's stay together j“ j“ whether, whetherj“ -j“ whether times are j“ -j“ good or bad j“ j“ happy or sad j“ j“ let's stay together j“ somebody way back here now! J“ whether j“ j“ whether good or bad j“ j“ happy or sad j“ Katy Perry can do it too, you know. She often uses the devices of gospel music. It's hidden behind a lot of production, but it's there. -J“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ washed my sins away j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ when he washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ oh, when my Jesus washed j“ -j“ when Jesus washed j“ -j“ he washed my sins away j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ he washed 'em right away, yeah j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ the past 34 years now j“ -j“ oh, happy day j“ j“ oh, yeah j“ j“ oh, happy day j“ j“ oh, happy day j“ -j“ baby, you're a firework j“ -j“ firework j“ can you do this? When I was 5, the guy that was preaching at the revivals, he came up to me out of, you know, a few thousand people and said, you know, "you're gonna sing." J“ do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind j“ j“ oh, happy day j“ j“ do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin like a house of cards j“ j“ oh, happy day j“ j“ do you ever feel already buried deep? Six feet under screams, but no one j“ j“ oh, happy day j“ j“ do you know that there's still a chance for you j“ j“ 'cause there's a spark in you you just gotta ignite j“ come on! J“ the light and let it shine j“ j“ just own the night like the fourth of July j“ j“ 'cause, baby, you're a firework j“ I started singing in church when I was 9, and I loved "oh, happy day," and singing gospel music, and I felt like that foundation was really great. J“ boom, boom, boom j“ j“ even brighter than the moon, moon, moon j“ j“ come on it's always been inside of you j“ j“ and now it's time to let it through yeah j“ j“ 'cause, baby, you're a firework j“ j“ come on, let your colors burst j“ j“ make 'em go, "oh, oh, oh" j“ j“ you're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe j“ j“ boom, boom, boom j“ j“ even brighter than the moon, moon, moon j“ j“ oh, boom, boom, boom j“ j“ even brighter than the moon, moon, moon j“ The cultural exchange is to find cultures that relate to New Orleans. These are the roots of the roots. It's a tradition that we have inherited from our ancestors. I have to say there are lots of afro-descendants here. This resemblance touches our heart. We see that we are the same. It's just the ocean that separates us. Music unites people. The festival is traditional, but when you think of heritage, heritage isn't just a rearview mirror. Heritage is looking out the windshield too. Are you good? Are you really good? Are you really good out there? Then you gotta hop with me. It's gotta be like... Where the keys at? Where the keys at? Somebody say, "we ready!" We ready! -J“ all my people up plus the sky is up j“ -j“ what's up? J“ j“ I'm up, good luck to the ones that thought I'd give it up j“ j“ this my come up j“ j“ coming up the stairs I climb the charts j“ j“ billboard's feeling close to home dazed out on my mommy's porch j“ j“ I got a gumdrop and a raindrop j“ j“ and I do that cartwheel like a Ferris wheel j“ j“ I'm a spinning top j“ j“ my world is the carousel I look, look at my money... j“ back in the day when you're talking about New Orleans, you know, mardi gras, you know, "show me those breasts," and "let's just listen to the jazz," and "where's the brass band?" You know, like as if that's all we were. I'm a part of the generation that's always been going on here, but has been more underground. I call it the New Orleans now. That's the spoken word, the hip-hop artists, the soul artists, the people at an open mic, freestyling, underground places that the tourists don't know about. You know, I'm from that wave. J“ while the beat goes up like a meter j“ j“ got a hummy, go, that's my guzzlerj“ j“ look at me, I'm flying, cockpit girl, I'm really high j“ j“ I'm too lit, spaceship and my new hit j“ j“ look, look, look all my money's in the air j“ j“ I throw it up, watch it fall everywhere look! J“ j“ money j“ New Orleans is so special because we do accept all walks of life, no matter if you're black, white, gay, straight. J“ it don't bounce, it don't bounce j“ j“ I'm that queen that'll make you bounce j“ j“ that's where I'm from j“ j“ big freedia queen diva make ya getcha getcha j“ j“ better walk to the beat that's where I'm from j“ j“ big freedia queen diva let me see ya j“ freedom of expression and freedom to do whatever they choose to do and love whoever they choose to love and to be themselves. J“ release j“ j“ release j“ j“ if you lean on me and I lean on you j“ j“ we can put our backs together, baby make a lean-to j“ j“ if you lean on me and I lean on you j“ j“ we can put our backs together, baby make a lean-to j“ no one was aghast at the idea of showing up to a show in curlers and lingerie. They embraced it immediately. J“ stand by your man, I'ma lean on you stand by your man, I 'ma lean on you j“ j“ they say stand by your man and I'ma lean on you j“ it makes us who we are as people and as a city. All the different people, we make the flavor of New Orleans. J“ you shine like a starj“ j“ you know who you are j“ j“ you're everything beautiful j“ I was looking for a place to go to pursue, you know, music, and New Orleans just had this deep soul underbelly that you don't get in these other musical cities. J“ show me the one I need the most j“ it's not a music-business city. It's a music-culture city. J“ wish [knew you when I was young j“ j“ we could've got so high j“ you know, and to see two strangers going, "yeah, this is my song," and they're like, "yeah, me too," you know, that's New Orleans, you know, people coming together over music. Come on, 'round the world, baby. Come on. J“ oh-oh, oh-oh j“ j“ oh-oh, oh-oh j“ j“ oh-oh, oh-oh j“ j“ I wish I knew you when I was young j“ New Orleans is nothing without its people and its artists. It's just sinking ground. Literally. Welcome to an early edition of "daybreak." We 're watching hurricane Katrina as it unleashes its wrath on the Gulf coast. You know, after Katrina, we almost lost not only our city, but a way of life. It is gaining strength again. It is now stalking the Gulf coast. This is the nightmare scenario that many people have been talking about for so many... The city of New Orleans under a mandatory evacuation. We had reports of a levee break earlier this morning, up to nine feet of water in some areas east of the city. Major levees broke, and slowly, the city has filled with water. The city is going to be essentially uninhabitable for many days. New Orleans is no longer there. It's gone. It's all undennater. There's no home. I didn't know where to go, what to do. J“ I left home to never come back j“ j“ but I want you j“ j“ but I want you j“ I remember coming back after the storm and not recognizing anything. From the buildings to the trees, street signs was gone, everything. It was like somebody had just dropped a bomb. We're talking about an entire city that was devastated. So how do you begin to rebuild from below zero? J“ you're the one that gave me life j“ j“ by my bondage j“ I still long to be here. I still have no place to live here. It bothers me. J“ I got my eyes on you j“ j“ no turning back j“ j“ I'm gonna lay you down j“ j“ I got my eyes on you j“ That was a defining moment for us because none of us knew how that story ended. There was no playbook. New Orleans had to come back. That wasn't a question. It was, how was it going to come back? Katrina. Boy, it's hard to know where to stop, because what it took to get the festival on... I mean, this whole city was falling off a cliff, and trying to find something that people could look at or be a part of as being... having some normalcy to it. After Katrina, there were people in the congress that said, "why rebuild that place? It's just gonna flood again. Let it go." We said, "no, we're not gonna let this thing go down." It was kind of an oxymoron, like, you can't do it, but you have to do it. There was no infrastructure at all. Quint Davis literally broke down crying. He said, "this is all we have to keep this city from falling apart. We gotta have it. No matter who comes or what happens, we have to put on jazz fest." Within a week or two, it was Jimmy buffett, Irma Thomas, Dave Matthews Band, Bruce Springsteen, the meters, Paul Simon that were gonna come play. People that love the city and love the festival showed up, and it was the thing that pointed the arrow to the fact that we could get through this and come back. So we're getting ready to open, and we get a call from the police saying we have a traffic problem. There's people lined up. They're cutting off esplanade. And we're like, "oh, my god." We open the gates, and thousands of people come in. And I can't figure out how this could happen. And I remember being on-stage and saying, "I don't know, you know, who you are, where you came from, and how you got here. But, you know, we're here. Thank god, we're here." It was the first indication that people would come to New Orleans. It let the world know that New Orleans was alive. It was like a cleansing, you know. You felt like the music was cleansing the city and just showing everything's gonna be all right. Jazz fest was like the crystallization of bringing the world back to New Orleans and New Orleans back to the world. It's like, "we're back. We're here." When we saw jazz fest was happening, that was a sign that we're gonna be all right. Bruce Springsteen, who had never played the festival before, had just done this project "the seeger sessions." They were going to premiere it at the festival. So I wanna sing this and dedicate it to the people and the city of New Orleans tonight. It was our very first show with that band. It was one of the very first times I can remember being frightened before I played. J“ there's a blood-red circle j“ j“ on the cold, dark ground j“ j“ and the rain is falling down j“ j“ the church door's thrown open j“ j“ I can hear the organ's song j“ j“ but the congregation's gone j“ j“ my city of ruins j“ j“ my city of ruins j“ "my city of ruins" was something I originally wrote for asbury when it was down and out and at its worst, you know, and it just seemed to sum up a lot of what New Orleans was going through at that time. J“ the boarded-up windows j“ j“ the empty streets j“ j“ while my brother's down on his knees j“ j“ my city of ruins j“ you were coming into a city that had great need. There was something to push up against, which is when artists are at their best. J“ come on, rise up j“ j“ come on, rise up j“ -j“ come on, rise up j“ -j“ rise up j“ -j“ come on, rise up j“ -j“ rise up j“ -j“ come on, rise up j“ -j“ rise up j“ There are certain moments during the night when you meet your audience head-on, and that's when the healing begins. There's a part in "city in ruins" where they... Where it is... where he says, "with these hands, with these hands, now we'll rebuild." J“ now, with these hands j“ j“ with these hands j“ j“ with these hands I pray, lord with these hands j“ So you have, you know, 100,000 hands in the air, 100,000 people crying. J“ and I pray to give me hope, lord j“ I mean, this is some of the most devastated people, that really had nothing. And Bruce, in his power, was ministering to them. J“ lord, ipray j“ j“ yeah, I pray j“ j“ oh, iprayj“ j“ oh, yeah, lpray j“ By the time we hit "city of ruins" at the end of the night, something had happened, and the crowd just sort of melted into it, and it was one of the most beautiful concert experiences I've ever had. J“ amazing grace j“ j“ how sweet the sound j“ j“ that saved a wretch j“ J“ioncej“ j“ I once was lost j“ m found j“ j“ oh, but now j“ j“iseej“ j“ through many dangers j“ j“ tolls and snares j“ j“ I have, [have already, already come j“ j“ 'twas grace j“ j“ that brought me safe j“ j“ this far j“ j“ and grace shall lead me j“ j“ home j“ Music has a way of bringing us together. Here in New Orleans, that's just so true. J“ when the saints go marching in j“ j“ oh, how I want to be in that numberj“ j“ when the saints go marching in j“ j“ oh, when the saints go marching in j“ j“ oh, when the saints go marching in j“ We're closing the book on 50 years. You know, over 50 years, a lot of things have happened. Life's to be enjoyed, not endured, and there's a lot of that in New Orleans. It's just a great festival experience that can't be matched. Jazz fest! We say hey, hey! Come on! Everybody jump! Jump, jump! Come on! You're not gonna get it unless you get here. You just gotta walk in, you know? J“ oh, yeah j“ You can't help but get caught up in it. Once you walk through those gates, you kinda forget about the rest of the world. All right, take me up there! Take me up! Here we go! Everybody, come on! I need to see all your hands! Come on! Sleep is the cousin of death. That's jazz fest, you know. You can sleep when you're dead. This can only happen in New Orleans. That's the magic of the festival. Happy 50th jazz fest! We gotta keep it going another 50 years! Right here in New Orleans! Thank you! Don't forget, we love you! J“ I saw her today at the reception j“ j“ a glass of wine in her hand j“ j“ I knew she could make the connection j“ j“ at her feet was her footloose man j“ let's do it!
