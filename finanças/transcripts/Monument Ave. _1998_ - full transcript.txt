Tommy with the big head or Tommy with the small head? No, the one with no teeth. Oh, yeah, Tommy the tooth. Yeah. Yeah. His mother works over in the housing department. Yeah. She says the mayor’s tryin' to stick another colored family in the projects. Finally put a goddamn Guinea in the mayor’s office, he wants to put niggers in the projects. Fuckin' wop. Why don't we put '’em over in his neighborhood, huh? All of '’em... Niggers, spicks, zipper heads... Put '’em all in the north end. You know what I'm sayin'? Hey, guys! Uh-huh. Let's get to work here, for chrissakes. I did my job. I stole the fuckin' thing. You know what, red? You should run for mayor. Platform like that, you can't lose. Look, I ain't no racist. Our mothers can walk around 3:00 in the morning, no one’s gonna touch 'em. You stick outsiders in the projects, the whole system falls apart. They’ll be sellin' drugs in the street and drive-by shooters. You Mark my words. It ain't like they all wanna move here, you know. They wanna live amongst themselves like us. It's all this liberal bullshit. Harvard egghead motherfuckers. Jack Kennedy wouldn't have pulled this crap. Put the pucks back, Murphy. You hear the shit about Teddy Timmons? Aw, Christ. Who told you that? Someone said they saw him. I heard things. You heard. Did you see it with your own eyes? No, I just heard things. It's just people talkin'. If he was out, I’d know. Hey, mouse.

Does that mean there's baby fags? Let's go over. Come on. Nah. I don't wanna. I'm fine where I am. No. Let's go over. Come on. I know I might like her, but sometimes she's a different person. I don't know what she's gonna be one moment to the next. Don't say anything. Hey. What's goin' on? Boys. - Hey, Sheila. - Hey, mouse.

Put the fucking' money away. I'm not goin' outta the game! Don't fuck around! - I got nothin' to fuckin' hide, Bobby. - You know what you’re doin'? Look at me! I got nothin' to fuckin' hide. Come on, let's get a beer. I'm dyin' of thirst here. L.B.J., he become president. L.b.j. Shot j.F.K.? Yeah, that's a... What's your point? What... all right. Where's he from? - From Texas. - Right!

Fuck off. I would say we should do this together. Just the two of us. Just the two of us, for a change. I'm sick and tired of you, if you want to know the truth. Tell me the truth. Nice and easy. Hey, boys, how you doin'? All right? Hey, mouse, move over. Come on. Here you go. Hey, Bobby? Yeah. I heard you got a bad count the other night. Consider that a gift, all right? Thanks, man. So... Teddy fuckin' Timmons, huh? I heard you were back. Yeah. You don't call me! Well, no, you see, Jackie, I-I just got back... What are you boys drinkin'? Hey, shang, get a round in here, will you? - Sure, Jack. - Fuckin' Celtics, huh? I-I-I g-guess you been hearin' stories about me, huh, Jackie? I heard you was back is all. Well, let me tell ya. This is fuckin' hilarious. You’re gonna piss your pants. Remember that Perez, that fuckin' spick from Dorchester? What, the little guy? R-Remember you sent me and Gavvy down to talk to him... - Gavvy, you remember that? - Sure, I remember that. So about a month ago these f.B.I. Guys come to talk to me in the joint. And I don't even talk to regular cops, ever, you know? Like when they came to me after I got busted with all that coke... And they said "Jackie o," and I said, "I know the guy, but I don't work for anyone." - Hey, thanks for that, by the way. - That's no problem, Jackie. So, these f.B.I. Guys, they want to know about Perez... '’cause they're building a case against him, right? You’re gonna love this. I say, "you mean junior Perez of Columbia Avenue in Dorchester, about five-two, got a fat-assed girlfriend looks like a fuckin' pit bull?" They said yeah, and I said, "no, never heard of the guy." She does look like a pit bull! Right? So, so now they roll up their sleeves. They're not going nowhere. And I sit there for three hours, fuckin' sweatin', shakin'. I almost start crying'. It's like fuckin' academy award time. Finally I break down. And, you know, i, I tell '’em the truth. I-I'm like George fuckin'Washington. I cannot tell a lie. "I know Perez and I used to work for him." I-I give '’em Perez, that fat fuckin' columbian prick Menendez, locations, everything. And then they come back to me, and they want me to testify. It's like witness protection bullshit, and I'm like, "fuck you. "I'm not going into any witness protection bullshit fuckin' plan. Fuck that! We made a deal!" So, now, this lawyer they gave me is all over '’em. I'm not even safe in the joint with the witness protection and shit, and they... They got no choice! They gotta let me go. Fuck! Can you believe that? Fuck! Yeah. I tell ya, it was a fuckin' nightmare. Never trust those feds, man. They fuckin' lie. I'm lucky to be here. - Yeah, fuckin' feds. Cocksuckers, huh? - Pricks. They're in Boston looking for Puerto Ricans. In Washington they're stealin' us blind! - Exactly. - Absolutely right. You got that right, Jack. Hey, here's to Teddy. Welcome home! When the cops gonna learn, huh? This town don't talk. Especially this kid right here. A fuckin' chatterbox. The gift of gab, huh? Hey, guys, I gotta go. Katy’s mother's cookin' dinner. Anyone got any Rolaids? Hey, hey, Jackie, uh, we’re cool, right? Sure, sure, hey. Give me a call on the weekend. We got some work. Oh, uh, did skunk mention anything to you about that dealership thing up in Saugus? I don't know about that, Jack. Okay, we’ll talk about it. - Okay, see ya, boys. - See ya later, Jack. Yeah, Jack, see you around. Take it easy, Jack. See ya later. All right. Bye-bye. Wow. You did all right. I ever tell you the story about the time mouse broke into a yuppie apartment? - No. - Seamus, did you hear this story? This is a great fuckin' story. This is fuckin' hilarious. There was a place on monument Avenue that mouse and I were lookin' to break into. It was gonna be the two of us, but I was someplace. Where the fuck was I? - Who knows? - I don't know where I was. Anyways, mouse decides to break in on his own, which... You know mouse like I do... Is a fuckin' wicked bad idea. Like the time you ate a whole fuckin' hot pepper, one bite. - I thought that was a pickle. - This is worse that that. So, anyways... Not this fuckin' story. You tell this story, I'm gonna tell the one about that broad was goin' down on you and she puked. Who? Connie feelin'? Fuck, I'm proud of that story. - Fat Connie feelin'? - This is when she was skinny. It wasn’t like I took her to the prom. She blew me and she puked. Big deal. Anyways, he breaks in by himself so he's in this apartment, beautiful fuckin' place, right? And he's lookin' at the place, admirin' the books... The whole thing. He figures he's got all the time in the world, '’cause the guy works nine to five. It's like one o'clock first thing he does, he makes a sandwich. That's what you always do when you break into a place. What was the sandwich? Ham and three cheese. With tomato sauce. Right, three cheeses. - It was, uh, Havarti... - And blue cheese. - Havarti! - Blue cheese and, uh... The gallopin' gourmet over here. Anyways, he starts eating, he's halfway through. Now he's gotta take a shit. So he goes downstairs, he's sittin' on the throne... Readin' some magazine. What was it? Time or> Newsweek? - Current events? - A good magazine. Anyways, he gets done, he goes upstairs, he finds a water bed, which he's never seen before. He's only seen 'em on TV, or he's heard about it. So here he is, gettin' ready to get in the waterbed, and he finds... What has he always wanted to find his whole life and can never find? Baseball cards! Worth a lotta fuckin' money. A big photo album full of fuckin' old baseball cards, right? So he's jumpin' up and down, creamin' in his pants, flippin' through the cards. Fuckin' Mickey mantle's rookie card, Tom Seaver’s rookie card, right? He's so goddamn happy. He feels he's gonna be rich, he's got it made. - He falls asleep. - I was out of it before I broke in. Yeah, that's what I do before a job: Downers. Four hours later he wakes up to the sound of the key in the door. Fuckin' Goldilocks here. I wake up, I think I'm at my mother's house. But this guy's starin' at me, guy in a suit, big fuckin' guy. He says to me, "excuse me," and I'm like, "who the fuck are you?" He's lookin' at me, he picks up the phone, he starts to call the cops. I'm like, shit, I realize where I am, so I bolt. I'm out the door. I dodge around the guy, a bit of a dance. Leaving everything behind: The baseball cards, the TV, everything. So here's this guy on the line with the cops, going, "yeah, somebody just broke into my apartment." The cops are going, "what did he take?" He looks around. "A fuckin' nap!" Let's go. Come on. Jesus Christ! Jesus fuckin' Christ! Everybody out! Everybody out! Oh, Jesus, this is bad. Teddy. Jesus, fuck! Fuck! That fuckin' Jackie, man. The fuckin' cocksucker. Come on, Bob. Bob, come on. We gotta go. Bob, we need to go now! Yeah. You too, Seamus. Come on! Come on, we gotta get outta here. Come on. Come on! Here you go. You too, Seamus. Come on! Seamus, let's go. Now, Seamus. Let's go. Now! You can't be sittin' here! Come on! Lee, watch the door. Got it. Bros, what have we got? Teddy Timmons. Ah, Jesus. Teddy Timmons is your cousin, isn't it, O'Grady? Hey, you’re an o'Grady too, right? Yeah, sure. You’re Bobby's cousin Seamus from Ireland. Am I right or wrong? Yeah. I thought so. Which means that's your blood on the floor over there, more or less. I'm sorry for your trouble. Sit down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on, it's all right. I assume they already explained to you the part about keepin' your mouth shut, so let me fill you in on the rest of it. You were in the bathroom. That's right. Everybody in this joint was in the bathroom during the shooting. Maybe you didn't know that about this neighborhood. Oh, yeah. The barrooms around here got the biggest heads in America. Sure. Just last month, when Jay Monroe got shot over at Rosie’s sub shop, there were 22 guys in the toilet then. Can you imagine that? Twenty-two guys all takin' a piss at the same time. Yeah, but that's just around here. You see, over where I live, in west Roxbury, we got a lot of Irish kids like you... With no papers or skills, just trying to make an honest buck. But we don't have this kind of shit. Ignorant punks hidin' behind intimidation tactics... And shit-eatin' codes. When we have to go to the toilet, we go one at a time. Yeah, well, this ain't west Roxbury. You got that right. So tell me, O'Grady, just for the record. - I was in the bathroom. - How about you, digger? - The bathroom. - Bros. - I was in the bathroom. - Murphy. - I was in the bathroom. - What about you, Seamus? Where were you during the shooting? Look at me, son. I was in the bathroom. Say again? I was in the bathroom. You ask why I keep playing these stupid games. That's fine. We all know who's behind it. And I don't give a rat's ass how many times he pays the rent... For some poor old grandma down in the projects... Or all the guy's he's whackin' are hopeless cases. This is still my beat, and I'm gonna be here when somebody talks. Get outta here. Go on. Get the hell outta here. Bros, gimme a beer. - We should fuckin' do somethin'. - Yeah, we should fuckin'... We should fuckin' what, dig? What the fuck you mean? Well, you know... I saw who fuckin' killed him! Shut up, Seamus. I won’t fuckin' shut up. I saw who killed him! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! It's between Jackie and Teddy. Teddy should have done his time, kept his fuckin' mouth shut. Instead, he decided to rat Jackie out. He dug his own fuckin' grave. How do you know? Teddy said he didn't rat anybody out. Hey, hey! Forget what Teddy said. It was on the street. Fuck. That's it. That's it? That's the end of it? Yeah, that's the end of it, yeah. Seamus, we work for Jackie, okay? He paid for the clothes on our back, and he paid for your plane ticket over here. I mean, you know. That's right. Everybody wants the neighborhood to stay the way it is. No more outsiders. Take care of ourselves. Police ourselves. Fuck. Jackie might as well be carryin' a fuckin' badge right now. That's the way it is. I tell you one thing. Fuck, man. Fuckin' old days, something like this happened, you just settled it with your fists. You know? You use your hands. Yeah? Worst that would happen, maybe somebody would come after you with a shovel, you know? A baseball bat. Yeah. - Not anymore, though. - Not anymore. Look who it is. - What's he doin' here? - Patsy, how are you? Good to see you. Jesus, look at him. Must have balls the size of barbells. Just like fuckin' nothin' happened, huh? He shouldn't be here. Hey, bros, Kelly, how ya doin'? Sad day, huh? Sad day. How ya doin', Jack? Hey, Katy. Hey, Jackie. I'm a little busy right now. Yeah. Mrs. Timmons, how are you? Oh, Jackie. I'm so sorry for your troubles. Thank you. Yeah, he was a great kid, and we’re gonna miss him. Hey, Mrs. O'Grady, how are you doin'? Thank you for coming, Jackie. Listen, if there's... If there's anything I can do, you know, please let me know. Here, I want you to have that, just to kind of... for the day. Catch you later. Don't forget: Anything I can do. Go ahead. Huh? I hate this, man. I know, but it's gotta be done. I’ll go over with you. No, that's okay. You stay. No, it’ll go. You stay. Yeah. You sure? Thank you, Herbert. There you are, Bobby.

What, you on the wagon? Just keep your eyes on the road, digger. Okay, they're gonna lock the shop up tonight at 9:00. The alarm’s gonna be on, so that's gonna guarantee the insurance coverage. The Ferrari's gonna be parked at the top of the ramp at the third floor. The place is gonna be deserted, so get in there quick and don't draw attention to yourselves. All right. Take the goggles off. Take the fuckin' goggles off. What I want you guys to do is break the window on the ground-level floor, reach in there and hit that button. Hurry up. Come on. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go. Once the glass is broken, you activate the alarm. This gives you two minutes... I repeat, exactly two minutes... Before the cops show up, so don't be dickin' around. Get to the third floor. The Ferrari's gonna be parked in the far corner. You gotta hot-wire the car to make it look real. Why not let air out the tires? Mouse, we’re talkin' about a fuckin' Ferrari here. If the alarm isn't on, there's no insurance money, and none of us get a dime. Quit breakin' my balls and cut the bullshit! Skunk, skunk. You guys bring the car back here. As soon as skunk hears from the buyer, you guys get your money. Twenty-fuckin'-grand. Buy a lot of blow for that. Yeah, a lot of stepped-on blow from you, Jackie. You watch yourself. Shit. Stay down.

Hey, hey. Easy! Easy! Fuck! I'm sorry, Bobby. I'm sorry. Listen to me. I just wanted to fuckin' get a sandwich. He never said a word. What'd you say? I said, he never said a word. Deaf, dumb and blind. You picked him up? Damn right, I picked him up. He was eyewitness to a murder. Just a fuckin' kid for Christ’s sake. Yeah, that's right. He was just a kid for Christ’s sake. Teddy Timmons had it comin'. Probably would’ve ended up back in the joint if he’d have lived. But this kid. This kid just got off the boat! He had his whole life in front of him! Then you got ahold of him, and you taught him the rules! Now this! So if you’re lookin' for somebody to blame, don't look at me! Take a good look in the fuckin' mirror! You’re a fuckin'... You want some of me? Huh? You want some of me? Huh? Get him out of here! Come on, fuck! Come on. Come on, tough guy. You want me?

She's been at the bottle bad. Where've you been? I was out. She put through the call to Dublin. After that, forget it. Should've been here. Ma, you okay? I told Bridy you’d call Ireland later... And explain why her boy’s comin' home in a box. You have to take $2,300 down to the funeral home and give it to Mr. Kelsey. Okay. It’ll pay for the plane too. Mary McLaughlin says... Jackie O’Hara was up drinkin' at the a.O.H. All night... While Seamus was layin' in the front seat of that cab. Oh, you goddamn disgrace. Ma! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The way you was raised. Calm down. Take it easy. He's dead! Calm down, calm down. Take that gun out of this house! You hear that? Get it out of this house! Help me here. I left the egg salad on the kitchen counter. Make sure you put it away before it goes bad. Okay. You know what, ma, I was thinkin'... I was thinkin' maybe I might, uh... Might leave for a while, you know? That'd be a good idea. Where you goin'? Over to Mouse's? No. I mean... I don't ... Maybe, you know, go out to the cape or something for a while to get away. Who’s after ya? Nobody. Honey, can we talk about this later? Well... Thing is, I have... I have some money I can leave ya, ya know? It's not a lot, but it’ll... It’ll help, you know? I don't know. I just feel like i-i just gotta get away...

That guy. We should say good-bye to him. I don't know. I don't know, digger. This is Seamus. He's a cousin. I wanna say good-bye to him. Jesus, Bobby, he's wearin' your suit. I'm sorry, kid. I shouldn't have left him in the car. I should've taken you right home. It's a fuckin' tragedy. You got your whole life out in front of ya. You know what this is? Huh? A fucking bug. You know where I found it? No. My mother's phone. You believe that shit? Yeah. She hears these weird sounds and things on the line. Check it out and there it is. Huh? UN-fuckin'-believable. In my mother's house. See what I'm sayin'? Fuckin' Teddy. You want a bump? No, thanks. This is the kind of shit I gotta put up with. I just want my money, Jack. I know, I know. I just wanna make sure you understand what I'm sayin' here. I understand. Shang, give me the package. I can list 20 guys who fucked me over the years. Jay Monroe, McLaughlin, Clark brothers. Only guys I can trust are right here in this room. And Katy, of course. Yeah? Yeah. Here you go, brother. Don't worry about what you owe me. It's on the house. You’re out of the fuckin' hole.
