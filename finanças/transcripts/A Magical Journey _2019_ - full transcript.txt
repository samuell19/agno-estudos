An eye for an eye. - Cut. - End slate. Not bad, yeah? Seven, take two. It was perfect, Polina. You liked it? I did. Great job, Brad. Have you seen, Nina. Give her a break, she's having fun here. I was just with her playing makeup. Oh, yeah? Look, Mommy. Where'd you find that? With the other costumes. Oh, it looks so good on you. I want to be an actress. You? You could be an actress. And when you all come together, you can make a movie about any story you can imagine, so you can make a movie about pirates, like this. You can make a movie about other planets with aliens. Let me show you. These are the other studios. And in each one of them, there's a different world. And all this belongs to you, Mommy? Yes. You're grandparents worked very hard to build all this. And they left it to me. And someday, this will all be yours. So this is where it all began. Where what began? The truth. Wait, come here. Let's get a hot chocolate. Now that you're older, I'll tell you a secret about this studio. So, the story I'm gonna tell you happened many years ago, the day before my 12th birthday. I'd been living with my wicked Aunt Varvara, my mother's sister. She used to make me feel so lonely, locked up in a small bedroom in that giant mansion of hers. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember my parents' faces and for some strange reason, my aunt would never talk or answer any of my questions about them. Polina. One day, my cousin, Dillon, gave me a box, a beautiful wooden box. He said he wanted us to be friends. I thought he probably felt as lonely as I did in this horrible house, which was anything but a home. But even if I desperately needed a friend, how could I be friends with someone who was so mean to me? So I took the box, but I didn't accept his friendship. When I opened the box, it felt like discovery something magical. A treasure. I found several documents that led me to a movie studio. This studio, Nina, but at the time, I had no idea what a movie studio was. That's also when I found in that very same box, a torn photo of a man. Who could he be? My father? A lot of questions came with that box, but not a single one of them could be answered. Where did you find that box? Where did you find that box, where? In Dillon's room. Hmm. Is this... My father? Your parents are dead. I'm sorry. I'm your family right now. Dillon! Yes, Mom. I didn't know it at that time, but my father came out of jail that exact same day. What had he done? Was he a criminal? Would we be reunited someday? Anton Barko. You are being released, but you are on probation for life. Look at me. And the most important thing, don't try to see your daughter. And you are banned from the cinema studio. Yes, your honor. We would both have many obstacles to overcome. And you can be sure my Aunt Varvara would do anything to prevent this dream from happening. Of course not. Why? I want to sell that damn studio now. If I wait for that little idiot to turn 18, it could be dangerous. Why? If Polina learns the truth about her family and what happened with them at the studio it could be disastrous. Tomorrow is Polina's birthday, so I have an idea. I want you to get a poison. I had to think and fast. I already memorized the studio's address from the documents I found in the box. I was hoping my plan to escape would work. It had to. Do you mind if I smoke? Actually I do. She's won 23 prizes. Can you imagine? I was sure that what I had found in the box were clues that would help me find out who I was, where I came from and what happened to my parents. That long walk through the night to find this mystery movie studio was the first part of the magical journey to come. I was so happy to be free for the first time in my life, but my father wasn't as lucky. Even though he was out of prison, he still wasn't a free man. Dillon. The key. On the door. No, it's not. Where is she? Where's Polina? You forgot to lock it. Lock what, Mom? The door. I don't remember. I'll go now and look for her. She must be in the house. When I finally arrived at the movie studio, I didn't know where to begin. How would I find the answers to my questions in such a huge building with so many warehouses? I later found out these were, in fact, different movies stages, different sets. I ran into a group of children at the entrance. As I found out later, it was a film workshop. I was so intimidated, but I knew I had to try to fit in with the crowd. That way, I could actually see the studio from the inside and maybe make some friends. Good morning everybody! Yay! I wanna welcome you all to Film Camp Studio Workshop. Okay, I'm studio director and my name is Saul, hi, Saul. Hi, Saul. And this lovely lady standing right beside me is my beautiful wife, Amanda. Hi, Amanda. I want you to think of these two as your camp counselors. They're gonna keep you very, very, very busy. All week. Your slight introduction into the magical world of the cinema, cinema. I can't find her, Mom. That's where she went. Where? What did I tell you two years ago? I said burn the box. I said burn it. Just go. Go where, Mom? Edward. Ugh! Yes, Madam. Take him to the studio and bring her back to me. Dead or alive, I don't care. Go, go, go. Hello. It's me. Oh, Varvara. - She's there. - Where? - The studio. - Who? Polina! Hey, I'm just... Did you see a little girl, she's about this big, she's got brown hair, she's got blue eyes. Did you see her come in? You didn't see her, okay. She's somewhere in the studio, a little girl, okay. You have to stop what you're doing, go look for her, don't worry about the gate. Just go look for her, okay. She's about this big. Blue eyes and brown hair, okay, look for her. That was the first time I found myself among other children. I was eager to know each one of them. Make some new friends for the first time in my life. I secretly hoped that one of them would come talk to me. Amanda, this is completely useless. Where is she? I haven't seen her since she was three years old for God's sake. Here she is, go and get her! Go and get her! Go, go! Polina! Polina, Polina, stop! Stop! Get out of the way. Why didn't you stop her? Where? Polina! Stop running? Please, which way out? Wait up! You keep running. I understood my Aunt Varvara had alerted the movie studio of my presence. I ran as fast as I could to hide from them without knowing where to go. Polina! Polina! Polina! I was terrified. All these people running after me. I opened the first door I could find, stage one. When I went in, I was even more terrified, but I couldn't go back. Come to me. What? Who are you? I will ask the questions. Where do you think you are, Polina? Do you know who I am? I know a few things. I know where you are. We call it the other side of the silver screen. I know it's confusing. You can turn around and leave or stay and find out why you've been handed. You have to collect all the remaining pieces of the photograph you have in your pocket and that photo will show you the truth about your parents. But if you don't, you'll be trapped here on the other side of the silver screen. Forever trapped in an infamous movie. By midnight of today, your birthday, you must have the whole picture. Make the right choice. Stand up and follow the light. Follow the light. The light. I was about to live an extraordinary adventure. I knew it. But if also knew that this journey would be far from easy. I would have to earn all the answer I was looking for. Anybody there? Anyone? Answer me. Hello? Please. Open up. Please. Get outta here. Please help me. Please, please, please, please. Go away, go away. I beg you, please. - No, shh. - No? No means no, go away. Find another place to hide. This one is mine. Please. Great thanks, get out of here, go. Over here. I surrender. Don't shoot. Don't shoot me. I won't move, really, you've got me. I'm Sasha, don't shoot me please. I just couldn't believe my eyes. It couldn't be. I found the second part of the photo, the one I was looking for in the young soldier's tank. Could this little girl be me? I had to find out. Where did you find this? Untie me. No, first tell me where. No, untie me first. No, you tell me first. Cleopatra gave me this picture. Who? Who's Cleopatra. Untie me right now. Where can I find Cleopatra? Shh. I met Cleopatra in a music class. Where? Over at the studio, stage three. We gotta go. Come on! Come one! Come on. This way! Polina! I was sure of one thing now. I wasn't in the real world anymore. I became the creator and the main character of a movie coming out of my own imagination. You must have the whole picture. Hello? What are you doing? I'm, uh, new. I can't find my class. Oh, can't find your class. What subject? Uh, music. Ms. Mogala's class, right, follow me. Ms. Mogala, I found this student sitting outside in the hallway, she was lost. But I've never seen her before. Are you a new student, sweetie? Ms. Mogala, I would very much appreciate it if you would be a little bit more aware of everything that is going on in this classroom, thank you very much. Mm-hmm. But I was also about to understand another rule about this game. You. Sit. The actors of the movie I was imagining were the same exact people I had met that very morning. They were just playing different roles in my film. Bad! Very bad! Awful! Go to the corner. Move! Cleo. Get up. What's this? What have I told you about dolls? Play. I said play. Do you hear me? I said play! Play! You can't treat children like that. You! Who do you think you are? I've been teaching for 20 years and nobody ever talked to me like this. Do you hear me? Nobody ever, ever, ever talk to me like this. Shh, shh, shh. No talent losers. That's what you keep calling your students for years. No talent losers, were you listening to that? Yes. He is my best student. All of your students should be your best students. All your students have a potential to play like that. What I've been listening to coming out of this classroom for 20 years, excuse me for one second. Could you move like this. This is what I've been listening to. This. That, that. Okay, give me your hand. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Give me your hand. Children, you're free. Thank you. Free. Okay. This way, go, go. What do you say we have a little break. Children, let's go. I met Cleopatra in music class. They way you played, it was wonderful. Can I please take my doll back now? Thanks. So are you Cleopatra? No. Then what is that? It is you, Cleopatra. Yes. Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt. Here, I'll help. This, you gave to Sasha, the soldier boy. Yes, for this doll. But, where's the rest of the photo? I traded it for this dress. But you shouldn't go. It's too dangerous, it's scary. This is me and this is my father, I think. The third part is missing. I think it might have my mother on it. I need to see all the pieces of this photo to know my parents. No. Understand? Please? I'm scared of the Boom-Boom. What do you want for your help? A Marie Antoinette dress? I want to see my daughter right now. Where's my daughter? I want to see my daughter now! There's nothing here for you Anton. Polina doesn't live here. She's run away. You'll never see your daughter again. Forget the past and go home. Oh, sorry, you don't have a home. Where's Polina? Where is she? I don't know. Where is my daughter? Last chance. Madame sent Dillon to find her at the studio. The studio. Well, you know, I think that Polina would probably want to be called because she- You can't go in there. Uh, good, you're here. Yes, I don't have much time to talk. Well, what the hell are you doing here? I was told Polina is somewhere in the studio. Are you all right? What? Varvara sent Dillon to get her and you know those two. You know what they're capable of. No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I have to find her. We will look in the studio. We know the studio. We'll look through everywhere. I'll go outside and search for her. Check the exterior set. The exterior set. Anton! How did you get out of jail? What should we do? Anton, Anton, Anton. Don't worry. We will find your daughter. - Yes. - Okay. Yes, okay, okay, okay. So this girl's Boom-Boom. Why are you afraid of her? This is Evanika. She has the photo. Ah, excuse me, uh, this piece of a photo, did you give this to him? I traded him that dress for part of a photo. Like this one? No, there was a woman on my part of the photo. But where's the picture of the woman now? I gave it to that big guy over there. Sir, do you have another part of this picture? You can forget talking to him. He can't hear a word. That's enough Goliath. Do you remember that photo that you had? What did you do with it? You wanna fight for it? Do you wanna fight? Don't worry, I'll get you that photo, no problem. Come on, stay with me. Bring it on. Come on. Help me with this rope. Help. Let go of her. - Let go of me. - Stop it. Someone help me. Get past him. Undo the rope. Are you hurt? Sasha? No, I'm okay. Really? Yeah, I'm good. Yes! Thanks for helping me out my friends. You lost the fight. Give me the picture. The photo. Photo, photo. - Picture. - Picture. This must be, must be my mother. I've never see her before. There is another piece missing. Why is he crying? What is wrong with him? I think he knows something about this picture. He's in bad shape, we gotta help him. Okay, so Cleopatra and you, see that wheelbarrow over there, go get it. Go, go. Did you see Sleeping Beauty? Where is she? Hey. Well, hello. I've been expecting you. You. You was a perfect subject for my test. The technical name of of this medication is Dry Bottom. You probably still make pee pee in your pants. I'm not a baby anymore. You are not a baby, but I bet you're still a bed wetter. Nurse! Yes, Doctor. Him. You know what to do. The observation room? Exactly. I don't want to. Leave him alone. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him. What is this? I need children, only children for mine experiments. You three I can use. Him, no. Follow me. Listen. Stay here, don't move. I'll be back. Let's roll. Why are you crying? What's he need? Give me the pen, quick. I miss the one I love, my princess. That photo reminds me of her. Who is she? My princess is the king's daughter. King, what king? Home, he's trying to say home. He wants to go home. We'll help you to find the princess, but will you help us to find Cleopatra? Can I drink this? No, this is pee-pee, yuck, do not drink that. Don't drink it. Okay, stop. Approach, please. No, no, no. Please, please don't, Doctor. Quiet Nursalina. I did not ask you for your terrible advice. I said approach. I will kill you, okay? Approach. Why isn't working. Nurse approach. Why won't the pedals work? I can't operate with defective pedals, come on. You have to push the button. Cleopatra. You guys, you have to get out of here before he wakes up. Quickly, you have to get out. Room five, go, quickly before he wakes up. Nursalina. What happened? Here it is. Oh, hold on. Wait. Something's coming from under there. Goliath, help me with this. Nah! Goliath! Where have you been? They're friends. We need to find the potion. What are you talking about? Goliath and me are from the viking stage. We're on a quest to find the potion to save our king. He was poisoned. How could that happen? And who did it? The new king's wife. The new queen wants to be on the throne and wouldn't let the princess and Goliath be together. They're in love. But the queen banned Goliath from the viking village. Vanished? That's not fair. So the princess sent me here to find Goliath. Where do we find the potion, is it here? In order to find it, we must leave here and go to stage six. Um, he'll never get through. We'll have to find another way out. Nurse, stop him! Kill him! Stop him! No, no, no, no, no. Where are the children? We need the children who make pee-pee in their beds. I will find them. Maybe there. Go through there. Bye-bye. Come back here! Don't let go! Anton is here and he's looking for his daughter, so now what the hell and I supposed to do? Find him quick. Tell me please you at least found Polina. Not exactly, she ran away. Saul, listen to me. If Polina or her father fine out what really happened, I'm finished and so are you. So I suggest to you, get off your ass and find them quickly. Otherwise, hmm, otherwise, do you wanna know where your next movie idea is coming from? Prison. Varvara, the studio is huge, okay? So how the hell am I supposed to? I'm coming over, idiot. Edward! What are you doing sleeping on the job? Where the hell is the car? It's still. Yeah. I said, I said. Pronounce your words. I said... Oh, you fool. I had so much fun with my friends, but they suddenly disappeared when I came out of the hospital set. The sun was almost setting and I was desperate to find the potion to cure the king from the viking world. Polina! What's this? Is this real? Goliath? Evanika? Polina. Polina. Polina. My sweet Polina. Polina. Surprise! Run, Polina, run! Polina, wait! I won't hurt you. Polina! Oh, wow! - Polina, you're here. - Polina, hey. - We're so glad you made it. - How are you? Goliath. Hello. Hi, hi. Wow, a monkey. Don't disturb him. Where Evanika? Evanika, yes, we're to get her back to normal. What do you mean? This teapot, it's well, Evanika. That's Evanika? Yes, she just took a potion and bang, she's now a teapot. Evanika, is that you? Hmm, that's what I said. - What is that? - Someone's in there. Let's check. Goliath. Can you open this door, come on. Bah! Hello. I'm not sleeping, I'm working with, what's going on, yeah. Hello, sir, we need your help with an antidote for our friend, Evanika. I see. I couldn't find an antidote in this book. Yes, but it is a potions book. This is a catalog. This one is for antidotes, hmm, yes. Yes, I have some stains. Beware of acne and clean your skin. So you're looking for an antidote for? We need it for our friend Evanika 'cause you see she's- We'll have her in due time. What's this, hmm? It's our friend, Evanika. No, that's a teapot. That might be, but it's also our friend. Your friend is a teapot? That's what I said. Okay, it's okay. I also have friends, friends who are kitchen tools, forks, knives, don't worry. So we'll save this teapot, is that the only problem. And we need to find a potion for the poisoned king. What king? The king of Viking's Village. Of course, kings are always in viking villages and friends are always the teapots. So, we need an antidote. A royal one. Yes, a royal antidote. Royal like royalty. So we'll use a little bit of this and this is always good for poisoned kings. Who wants a taste? - No. - Not me. - Hmm. - Uh-uh. - You? - Hm-hm. Okay, then, go find Mark the monkey. Here's the monkey. Yeah, like to feed the monkey, mop the monkey, there you go, yes. Lap it up, there you go. I thought that... Who are you? Who are you? Do you know him? Where are you from? Stay here, we'll take care of you. Who wants to try the blue one, it should work, come here. No, no. You're our volunteer. All right. Drink. Mm. So kiss it, maybe he'll become Prince Charming. Well? No. Haven't you learned yet? You gotta kiss a few frogs to find your prince. Science can't do it all, even though that's what people think. We all make mistakes. It's what you do after that really counts. I'll try to make a potion. Sure, why not try? Yay, Cleopatra nice. Yeah, that's great, good. I can do that, too. Give me that. I think this potion could be a universal cure all. Uh-huh. So... If it is the right potion, it will also work for acne, sorry, sorry. You drink this. Potion in, pimples out. Drink up buddy, come on, uh-huh. - Wow, it worked. - His face, whoa. Ah, yeah. Now, for your friend. Stay back. - Evanika! - Evanika! I'm so glad it worked. The potion can cure and transform everything. We've gotta get going here fast. Wait, he can help us to find the last part of this picture. So, uh. Look, this is my father. Your father, yes. And my mother. You mother, mm-hm. And this is me when I was little. Yes, that's you, so? The last part is missing. I need your help to find it. Let's see what we can do here. All right. So, let's see the photo now, hmm. Wait, there's a baby. So who is it? So, uh, okay, this potion is yours. Take it, it's powerful enough for all your needs, okay. You have to go, go children, I'm very, very tired. He's right, let's go. I'm too tired to live. And I'm too scared to die. So who's the baby in the photo? Well, I was running out of time and I still don't know what happened to my parents. Get in there, guys. Girls, I was looking for you. Scene for tomorrow on the pirate ship. But I wanna know what happened next. Please, Mommy. Okay, I'll come find you. I just need a couple minutes. I'll see you in a bit. Okay. So, I was more desperate than ever to find out who this baby was. I was back in what felt like nightmare, but was, in fact, the real world. Polina. Dillon chased me more fiercely than ever. Wait, I need to tell you something. Stop, don't run away from me! As I was running as fast as I could, a lot of questions were crossing my mind. Were my friends already in the Viking Village? Would they be able to help me find out the truth about my family. Stop running. Would I be on time? Stop! Polina! Oh. Sir, are you okay? Save the princess. What? From the evil queen. Watch, I will make this deaf girl speak. Book. Book. Take book. Take the book and read it. Now, read it. Read it. Read the book. Where's the king, give us back our king. Why isn't the king on the throne? Our king must rest. He's not well, now leave. Guards. My lord! My lord! We have returned. My favorite captain. How was the hunt? I've caught something bigger and more interesting than you can imagine. Get up you oaf. Goliath? What a surprise. We already have one deaf mute. What makes you think we need another one. Look at your Goliath, look at him. You love him very much, don't you. Tell me how much you love him and I won't kill him. Go on, say it. Take him. Take him to the culture wheel and bring a child for the queen to eat. Oh no! Your dinner, my queen. Good choice. What's your name little boy? Cleopatra. You look so tasty. Prepare him for my dinner. Polina, it's me, come here. Sasha, what happened? Get out of here. It's too dangerous. Don't worry, I won't leave you, I can help. No one will help us because of Dragor. Dragor? Who's Dragor? You really don't wanna know. Listen, free Goliath. He's the only one who can help you. Then you have to go cure the king. But how? With the potion. Give him the potion. Right. Go, go, be careful of the guards. Here, Goliath, drink this. Potion. Potion. We need to find the king to give him the potion. What is your job as a nanny? To watch the boys, look. Where's Goliath? Huh? Find him. Goliath escaped! My daughter. You were poisoned. By who? Daddy, you're all right. Daddy. Glad you're well. Oh, my king. My love, my darling. You look so much better. I was so afraid. My darling. My love. Oh. I am so happy. White, pick the white. This is very nice, white is life. White is like an angel. No, no, no, Dragor, no, no, no, no. You really should just take a look, here take a look. The king is back! It is the king! It is! It's the king. I love my king! Get out of my way. The king! The king! I love, oh! The king is alive, the king is alive. Oh, my king, I'm so, so happy that you feel better and I was just. The king! Let us out. Let us out, help. Let us out please. Polina. King! You think you've beaten me. I have a present for you, your majesty. I offer you the horrible, the mighty destroyer, Dragor! Dragor! Fight! Fight. Evanika, come here. We need your help. Go and get that horn. No one beats me! All hail Goliath! You did it! Is he dead? Oh. Oh, no, Goliath. Polina, give me that potion. Goliath, you're back. Oh, my gosh, Goliath. We were so happy. But now that I had successfully accomplished my magical journey through the seven stages, I still had to find out the truth. What happened to my family? Who was the baby in the picture? Would I get the answers to my questions that the hologram promised me? After the party, the viking princess took Cleo and I to a quiet and beautiful place on the water. Where are we? She said you gave me the most beautiful gift, my father's life and my husband also. It's my turn to give something to you. It was a surprise to thank us for saving her father and her prince. My daughter. My son. Is this mommy? He is my? Your brother, he is your brother. I haven't seen you for a long time. Cleo. You died with me in a fire many years ago. Died? But I'm alive. You are not alive, Cleo. You and I. No, I'm not dead. You're going to live again because of your sister's courage and because of yours. Listen to me. You don't know the whole truth. You have to go back to the other side of the screen. Oh, please come with us, Mommy. That's impossible Cleo. Only children can go to the other side. I'll stay with you, Mommy. You need to go have a life. Your father and your sister need you, Cleo, and you need them. Eight years ago they blamed your father for the fire that destroyed our studio and devastated our family. They put him in prison, but he is innocent. Find out. Go back to the other side. You'll not have much time left. Polina, come here. When you go look at the sky at night. Yes. You will see a little shiny star. Then think of me because it will be me looking down at you. I will always love you. I love you, Mommy. - I love you. - I love you. I love you. You have to go. It's really you. Oh, my God. How did they do that? Are you real? Cleopatra, Polina. Did you see him this morning? I can't believe you're here. They can't find Polina because they're idiots. Polina, my daughter, you're here. Polina. Dad. Thank God. Are you okay? Where is that criminal? Oh, there he is, arrest him now. Excuse me? Arrest this man. Don't arrest me, arrest her. You can't arrest her, she's my mother. That's right. Oh! Ah! Stop. Stop, arrest him! Break it up. You're gonna pay for what you've done. You're protecting the wrong people. Madame. What? I have the great pleasure to inform you that I've discovered the car's whereabouts. It's just here in the studio. Ha! Hoo! What are you saying? You're an idiot, Edward, it's midnight. I don't need a car anymore. Time has come. Everyone sit down now. You heard him, shouldn't we sit down? Good enough. You've done everything very well. Now, I will show you the last piece of the puzzle. Everyone look at the screen. The studio's bleeding money every minute, every second. If we sell the land to developers, we'd make millions. You have to sign it Anna. Our parents worked hard to build this studio. It was their dream. We have to honor that. We can't let developers destroy everything. This movie was over budget weeks ago. Where are you gonna find the money to finish it? We'll find the money if we do it together. Please, Varvara. We'll release the movie and if it's successful. Anna! Anna, come over here, I'm not a nanny. We need to shoot the scene now. Take Polina, now! We need to shoot, we're losing light. You're going to lose the studio, Anna. One way or another. Dillon. I've been looking for you for an hour. Put that down. Light me this cigarette. Burn the place. Come on, let's go, now, come on. We're leaving, move. Go, save yourself, please. I'm not letting go. Save Polina. No. Save her, please. Dad. Varvara. Varvara, I spoke to the inspector and I think, I think- Saul, shut up. Yeah, Saul, shut up. You both take your share of the insurance and I'll sell the studio. What are you talking about? Just shut up. I know Polina's the heir, but now I'm her guard. No, Anton- Anton will be in prison. Just remember, if one of us goes down, all of us go down. I told you, do something. Where's Varvara? Arrest her! - Go find her. - Yes, sir. - And arrest them. - Seriously, no. - Get up. - Come on. - Up. - What are you doing? I'm arresting you. Didn't you watch the movie? I didn't do anything. Are you out of your mind? I missed you so much, so much. Me, too. I want you to meet Cleopatra. Cleopatra. That's a real nice name. Hi there. His parents can't take care of him right now. So can he stay with us? Right now we don't have a place to live, but wherever we go, you're welcome. Come here. So, now we're gonna celebrate your birthday, okay. Okay. Huh, let's go. Come on, Cleo, tell her. A Marie Antoinette dress. I promise, we'll find it. Can you help us find a dress like that? Yes, I will, I think I have an idea of where one might be. Aha! Oh, great. Here we are. A Marie Antoinette dress, is this what you want? - Yeah. - Then it's yours, enjoy. Stop! Halt! You're under arrest. Please, they don't me... Police, open up, open up. Mom, I'm afraid.
