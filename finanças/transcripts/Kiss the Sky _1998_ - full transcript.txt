[ Man ] SO, UH, WHAT'S HE GOT YOU ON, PROZAC ? [ Man #2 ] ZOLOFT. LESS SIDE EFFECTS. HAS IT KICKED IN YET? I DON'T FEEL LIKE DRIVING MY CAR IN FRONT OF A TRUCK ANYMORE. THAT'S A START. I GUESS. I TRIED ALL KINDS OF STUFF. THEN I TOLD THEM I USED TO REALLY GET OFF ON SPEED, SO THEY GAVE ME SOMETHING WITH THE SAME MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. [ Sighs ] - [ Groans ] - AND THAT WORKED ? GAVE ME A FALSE SENSE OF WELL-BEING. I'D TAKE THAT. I COULD USE A GOOD LIE TO BELIEVE IN. GOTTA UP YOUR DOSAGE, PAL. [ Mumbles ] [ Sighs ] HOW DID WE GET HERE ? OFF AT WESTERN, UP TO BEVERLY. NO. HOW THE HELL DID WE GET HERE ? IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE BACK THEN. I THINK WE WERE SCORING POT FROM BILLY CUTNER IN '76. RIGHT. GREAT DOPE. HM. DROVE ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM SANTA CRUZ FOR IT. AND HIS BUDDY'S GIRLFRIEND WAS BETH, AND YOU... MARRIED HER. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. THIS WAS ALL JUST AN ACCIDENT. [ Moaning ] OH, GOD ! FRANNY. YEAH, BABE ? WILL YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH ? [ Sighing ] MMM. YOU-- YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE ME, DO YOU ? [ Chuckling ] EXCUSE ME ? WOULD I BE DOING THIS WITH SOMEONE I DIDN'T LIKE ? I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE A WOMAN OF REMARKABLE ABILITIES. JESUS, JEFF. WHAT DO YOU WANT ? WELL, I MEAN, I-- I KNOW THAT I CAN TURN YOU ON, BUT... YOU DON'T REALLY... APPROVE OF ME, DO YOU ? DO YOU THINK YOU EVER DID ? ???? [ Minor-Key Ballad ] ?? WELL MY FRIENDS ARE GONE ?? ?? AND MY HAIR IS GRAY ?? ?? I ACHE IN THE PLACES WHERE I USED TO PLAY ?? ?? AND I'M CRAZY FOR LOVE ?? ?? BUT I'M NOT COMING ON ?? ?? I'M JUST PAYING MY RENT EVERYDAY ?? ?? IN THE TOWER OF SONG ???? [ Scoffs ] BACK PAIN, CARS, THE HIGH COST OF COLLEGE, GREAT FAMILY VACATION RESORTS IN THE NORTHWEST, CARS, THE CATERER, DANGEROUS NEW ITEMS TO ELIMINATE FROM THE DIET, CARS-- WELL, YOU'VE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND. OH. I'VE BEEN A HELL OF A HOST. I COULDN'T TAKE THE ODOR IN THERE. WE ALL SMELL LIKE OUR PARENTS DID. WE SMELL LIKE DEATH. [ Chuckles ] I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE THINGS COST 20 BUCKS NOW. THOSE LITTLE WEENIE WANNA-BES HAD TO DISCOVER CIGARS. I LIKED IT BEST WHEN WE WERE CONSIDERED SOCIAL PARIAHS... AND A GOOD MACANUDO WAS TWO BUCKS. MMM. THOSE WERE THE DAYS. [ Chuckles ] BUT THEN YOU PUT AWAY YOUR DRAWINGS... AND GOT INTO DEVELOPMENT DEALS. REMEMBER ? FIGURED YOU'D MAKE A QUICK BUNDLE AND GET OUT ? THEN THE STOCK MARKET CRASHED. YEAH, THEN REAL ESTATE CRASHED. THEN I CRASHED. ELEVEN GRAND. HUH ? THAT'S MY MONTHLY NUT. MORTGAGE, PRIVATE SCHOOL, CARS, INSURANCE, VACATION, ENTERTAINMENT, HELP-- ELEVEN GRAND. WHAT'S YOURS ? I HAVE NO IDEA. FRANNY DOES THE CHECKBOOK. SHE'S ALWAYS PISSED WHEN WE COME UP SHORT. YEAH. WELL, I'M COVERING MY NUT... BUT THE PROSPECT OF COVERING IT FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS... DOES NOT INSPIRE ME TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING. WE ARE STANDING ON A HUGE MOUND OF CRAP THAT USED TO BE OUR FUTURE. IT'S BEST NOT TO LOOK DOWN. SINK SLOWLY UP TO THE EYEBALLS, BLINK ONCE, AND CALL IT A LIFE. I'M WORRIED ABOUT MARTY. THAT SWEET YOUNG THING WHO WORKS FOR HIM-- THE ONE YOU WERE SO INTERESTED IN TONIGHT-- EX, CURRENT, OR FUTURE ? [ Sighs ] THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE, FRAN. WELL WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? I WAS FLIRTING TO AMUSE MYSELF. WELL, I DON'T FIND IT AMUSING. MAYBE YOU SHOULD FLIRT THEN. WHY ? SO THAT YOU CAN SCORE SOME EXTRA POINTS... WHEN EVERYONE SEES HOW CONFIDENT YOU ARE... BECAUSE YOUR WIFE'S FLIRTING IS HARMLESS... UNLIKE YOURS ? NICE TRY. [ Chuckles ] I ALWAYS FORGET WHAT A GREAT ATTORNEY YOU ARE. THE MALE MIND IN THE FEMALE BODY STILL CONFUSES ME. THAT'S NOT QUITE THE COMPLIMENT IT USED TO BE, IS IT ? YEAH, IT IS. I STILL LOVE THE WAY YOU CONFUSE ME. SO WHAT IS IT ? WHAT IS WRONG ? I JUST, UH, REALLY THINK MARTY'S IN TROUBLE. IF THAT'S WHAT'S EATING YOU, TAKE HIM FISHING. ACT LIKE MEN FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. LISTEN. I'VE GOT SOME GUYS... WHO THINK THEY CAN LAND A HUGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE PHILIPPINES. STATE OF THE ART FACTORIES. IF YOU WORK WITH ME ON IT, I THINK I CAN CUT YOU IN FOR A THIRD. I DO TRUSTS, WILLS AND REAL ESTATE. WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT INTERNATIONAL LAW ? PICK IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG. WHO KNEW GRANOLA FROM BEAN SPROUTS... WHEN WE STARTED THAT HEALTH FOOD STORE 20 YEARS AGO ? GO TO THE PHILIPPINES FOR A MONTH ? I'VE NEVER LEFT BETH FOR A WEEK. THAT'S THE POINT. LIKE I COULD GET AWAY WITH THAT. WHY NOT? WE NEED A VACATION. WE GO AWAY WITH THEM, WE COME BACK EXHAUSTED. PLUS WE MIGHT EVEN MAKE A FEW BUCKS-- HEY, HEY. DIG THIS. ???? [ Rock On Radio ] ALL RIGHT, GODDAMN IT. ???? [ Ends ] I AM SO FUCKING SICK OF GETTING A LUMP IN MY THROAT... FROM LISTENING TO 25-YEAR-OLD MUSIC. LET'S MAKE SOME NEW MUSIC. WHAT WAS IT LIKE ? THE HOSPITAL. YOU NEVER TOLD ME. VERY QUIET. LIKE THOSE BUDDHIST MONASTERIES YOU USED TO READ ABOUT. OR MAYBE IT WAS THE TRANQUILIZERS. I COULD NEVER REALLY TELL. WHO KNOWS ? YOU MIGHT ENJOY IT THERE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. YES ! BUTYOUNEED TO CONVINCE BETH. THE PHILIPPINES ? OH JEFF, CUT THE CRAP. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO. I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY DO. LOOK, HE HAS DONE JUST FINE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, WHEN HE BARELY SAW YOU, AND YOUR NUTTY LIFE WAS YOUR BUSINESS. NOW SUDDENLY YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND ? I WAS ALWAYS HIS BEST FRIEND UNTIL YOU TURNED HIM INTO A LAPDOG. - I DON'T NEED TO LISTEN TO THIS. - YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU DON'T. YOU WANT THE NAME OF THE BEST MENTAL HOSPITAL IN L.A. ? THE SOUTH WING HAS WONDERFUL VIEWS. STOP IT ! JEFF, JUST DON'T FUCK HIM UP. BETH, I'M TRYING TO KEEP HIM FROM FALLING APART. [ Jet Engine Whining ] ?? GIVE ME BACK MY BROKEN NIGHT ?? ?? MY MIRRORED ROOM MY SECRET LIFE ?? ?? IT'S LONELY HERE THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO TORTURE ?? ?? GIVE ME BACK THE BERLIN WALL ?? ?? GIVE ME STALIN AND ST. PAUL ?? ?? I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE BROTHER IT IS MURDER ?? ?? WHEN THEY SAID REPENT ?? ?? REPENT ?? ?? I WONDER WHAT THEY MEANT ?? ?? WHEN THEY SAID REPENT ?? ?? REPENT ?? ?? I WONDER WHAT THEY MEANT ???? UNFORTUNATELY, THE FACTORY CANNOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE WANT BRAND-NEW FACILITIES, FOUR TIMES THIS SIZE. NEARBY WE HAVE PURCHASED THE LAND. WE'RE READY TO BUILD NOW. WE WANT STATE OF THE ART MANUFACTURING. EXACTLY. [ Crowd Talking, Cheering ] ???? [ Dance ] [ Women Laughing ] WOW. ONE'S BETTER LOOKING THAN THE NEXT. TOO BAD THEY CAN'T DANCE. THEY'RE NOT DANCING. THEY'RE DISPLAYING THEIR WARES. WE POINT, THEY COME OVER, WE EXAMINE THEM MORE CLOSELY. IF WE LIKE, WE MAKE A DEAL WITH THE MAMA-SAN, AND THEY LEAVE WITH US. YOU'RE SHITTING ME. NO. THIS IS A CIVILIZED COUNTRY. [ Woman ] COME WITH ME RIGHT THIS WAY, SIR. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING TO DRINK, SIR ? TWO SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. YEAH, I DON'T GET IT, MAN. WHY ARE YOU SO BIG ONTHIS? WHAT THE HELL IS THE STORY WITH YOU AND FRANNY ? YOU GUYS DON'T FUCK ANYMORE ? YEAH, WE DO. AND OCCASIONALLY, IF SHE DOESN'T COME, SHE FORGIVES ME. BECAUSE, HEY, IT WASN'T HER IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE. WELL, AT LEAST SHE GIVES IT TO YOU. MARTY, SHE DOESN'T GIVE ME SHIT. BECAUSE I'VE ASKED AND SHE'S DELIVERED, SHE EXPECTS SOMETHING IN RETURN. - LIKE WHAT ? - I HAVE NO IDEA. SHE WON'T TELL ME 'CAUSE I MIGHT DELIVER. YOU SEE, FRANNY IS JUST AS MISERABLE ABOUT THE WHOLE DEAL AS WE ARE. SHE'S JUST TOUGHER, THAT'S ALL. SO WHAT DO YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT ? I'M A SICK MAN, LYING ON A BED. A WOMAN APPEARS. SHE ACTUALLY FEELS SYMPATHY FOR ME. SHE REALIZES THAT I'VE TRIED... TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THIS WORLD, AND THE EFFORT IS KILLING ME. AND WITHOUT MY ASKING, SHE PERFORMS... CERTAIN PROCEDURES THAT RESTORE MY SOUL. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SHE CONVINCES ME... THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE FOR HER. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. LIKE SHE'S ACTUALLY ON YOUR SIDE. YEAH. WE'RE COMRADES. COULD A HOOKER PULL THAT OFF ? HOW DO YOU THINK THEY STAY IN BUSINESS ? DO YOU THINK WE'RE THE ONLY GUYS ON THE PLANET THAT FEEL THIS WAY ? ARE YOU READY TO PICK A GIRL YET ? EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN. I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEAR YOUR CONVERSATION. THESE GIRLS HERE ARE TRULY DELIGHTFUL. BUT, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE FINEST... THIS TOWN HAS TO OFFER, I'LL MAKE A PHONE CALL. [ Thunderclap ] ???? [ Minor-Key Ballad ] ?? BABY, I'VE BEEN WAITING ?? ?? I'VE BEEN WAITING NIGHT AND DAY ?? [ Chattering In Foreign Language ] ?? I DIDN'T SEE THE TIME ?? ?? AND I WAITED HALF MY LIFE AWAY ?? [ Continues Chattering ] ?? THERE WERE LOTS OF INVITATIONS ?? ?? I KNOW YOU SENT ME SOME ?? ?? IF YOU'RE SQUEEZED FOR INFORMATION ?? ?? THAT'S WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY IT DUMB ?? ?? YOU JUST SAY YOU'RE OUT THERE WAITING ?? ?? FOR THE MIRACLE ?? ?? FOR THE MIRACLE TO COME ?? [ Laughing ] [ Woman Continues Laughing ] IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, WE'VE JUST WALKED INTO A REAL, LIVE OPIUM DEN. FASCINATING. LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND PICK OUT OUR GIRLS. WAIT. LET'S CHECK THIS OUT. BENIGN FORCES MAY HAVE GUIDED US HERE. ARE YOU NUTS ? WE'RETAKINGDRUGS TO KEEP OUR HEADS TOGETHER. COME ON, MAN. I WAS WILLING TO GO ON YOUR TRIP. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PUSH IT. NO, WE'RE NOT PUSHING IT. WE'RE GOING WITH THE FLOW. ???? [ Continues ] ?? YEAH, LET'S DO SOMETHING CRAZY ?? ?? SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY WRONG ?? ?? WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE MIRACLE ?? ?? FOR THE MIRACLE TO COME ???? I FORGOT WHAT GREAT HALLUCINATIONS YOU GET FROM THIS SHIT. MUCH BETTER THAN ACID. YOU CAN KIND OF STEER. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ? THE YUCATAN, 1972. JULIE AND... VANESSA. YEAH. GOD WAS GOOD TO US THEN. WHY DO I FEEL LIKE SOBBING... WHENEVER I THINK OF THOSE TIMES ? BECAUSE WE WERE FREE ONCE. [ Man ] LAKE TOVA-- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE ON EARTH. IN THE GREAT ISLAND... OF SOLOUETE, MY HOME, THERE IS A LAKE, HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS, ON TOP OF THE WORLD. AND INSIDE THAT LAKE, THERE IS AN ISLAND. AND IF YOU STAND ON THAT ISLAND, YOU CAN KISS THE SKY. YOU MUST GO THERE, MY FRIENDS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE HEARD THAT, WE WOULD HAVE JUST DONE IT. I KNOW. I THINK IT'S THAT TIME AGAIN. [ Pig Squealing, People Chattering ] [ Jeff ] WE HAVE LOST OUR MINDS. WHAT DID YOU TELL BETH ? I TOLD HER WE WERE GOING TREKKING. [ Women Speaking Foreign Language ] NO, THANK YOU. NO, NO. [ Chuckling ] I MADE IT SOUND ANTHROPOLOGICAL. [ Shouts ] NO! ?? LIKE A BIRD ?? ?? ON A WIRE ?? ?? LIKE A DRUNK ?? ?? IN A MIDNIGHT CHOIR ?? ?? I HAVE TRIED IN MY WAY ?? ?? TO BE FREE ?? ?? IF I ?? ?? HAVE BEEN UNKIND ?? HEY. HEY, WAKE UP. HERE'S A BUS. ?? I HOPE THAT YOU ?? ?? WILL JUST LET IT GO BY ?? ?? OH LET IT ALL GO BY BABE ?? ?? AND IF I ?? ?? HAVE BEEN UNTRUE ?? ?? I HOPE YOU KNOW ?? ?? IT WAS NEVER TO YOU ?? ?? NO, NO, NO ???? ?? [ Continues Humming ] ?? THIS IS WHAT IT FELT LIKE BACK THEN. LIKE EVERYTHING WAS... BRAND-NEW. [ Laughing ] [ Continues Laughing ] [ Exclaims ] WELCOME TO BANDE'S PLACE. BY THE WAY, I'M BANDE BATARANGA. HI, BANDE. YOU'RE JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE. OH, THANK GOD. COME ON, DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR BAG. MY KIDS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, FOLLOW ME. GET YOUR PAPERS READY. CAN I HAVE YOUR PASSPORT, GENTLEMEN ? THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. AND THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT ? THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WELCOME TO BANDE'S PLACE. GET YOUR PAPERS READY. WHOA. FIVE HUNDRED PESOS ? THAT'S THE RATE. OH, COME ON. WHAT KIND OF FOOLS YOU TAKE US FOR ? [ Sighs ] YOU CAN ASK... THE TWO GENTLEMEN HOW MUCH THEY PAY ME. NO. HE'S RIGHT. IT'S ONLY 15 BUCKS. AND I THOUGHT YOU SAID NO OLD, RICH TOURISTS MADE IT UP HERE. WE PAY 300 OR FIND ANOTHER PLACE. EXCUSE ME, THE, UH, OLD, RICH TOURISTS... ARE PARTICULARLY BOTHERED BY THE YOUNG, WHINING CHILDREN ON THE PREMISES. SO, WHY DON'T MY FRIEND AND I RENT TWO MORE ROOMS, AND WE'LL SUBLET THEM TO YOU FOR 300 PESOS. AND IF YOU START BEHAVING LIKE GROWN-UPS, WE'LL CONSIDER IT A BARGAIN. HOW GROWN-UP. WHY DON'T YOU START BY HAVING DINNER WITH ME ? WHY DON'T I ? PLEASE TAKE US TO OUR ROOMS. OKAY. THANKS MATE, BUT SINCE IAMA GROWN-UP, I'LL PAY FULL FARE. FOLLOW ME. I'LL SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOMS. IF YOU NAIL HER, IT'S REALLY GONNA DEPRESS ME. WHY ? 'CAUSE... I WANT TO. OH, MY. YOU'RE MAKING A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. SO WHY RISK IT BY PUTTING MY DICK ON THE LINE ? WHAT'S THE RISK ? I THINK SHE'S SWEDISH. SEX IS THEIR NATIONAL PASTIME. SO YOU'LL TAKE THE OTHER ONE ? SORRY. HIKING BOOTS DON'T TURN ME ON. OH. HERE WE GO AGAIN. AW. YOU'RE SO CUTE WHEN YOU HAVE A HARD-ON. WHAT THE HELL. GO FOR IT, TANO. I'M SURE THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BUS TOMORROW. REALLY ? MM. ILSA, YOU EVER SMOKE ONE OF THESE ? NO, THANK YOU. SUCKING ON SOMETHING OF THAT SIZE, I THINK, A WOMAN ONLY DOES IN PRIVATE. HERE. GIVE ME THE BLOODY THING. EXCELLENT. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE COHIBAS. YOU, UH, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO INHALE THAT, THOUGH. YES, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSEDTO. ANDY'S NOT SO LADYLIKE. SHE'S A SHEEP FARMER. - REALLY ? - FUCKIN' "A," MATE. FROM A WHOLE FAMILY OF SHEEP FARMERS. THAT EXPLAINS WHY SHE HIT THE ROAD. ACTUALLY, MY FOUR YEARS AT OXFORD, AND TWO MORE... AT A STUFFY LONDON PUBLISHER... HAD ME PACKING MY BAGS AND HITTING THE ROAD. RIGHT. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR DINNER. I'M OFF TO THE NIGHT MARKET. [ People Chattering ] ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. HI. I NEEDED TO PICK UP A FEW THINGS MYSELF. WOULD YOU MIND IF I SHOPPED WITH YOU ? WHAT ABOUT ILSA ? NOT MY TYPE. YOU MEAN YOU LOST THE COIN TOSS ? [ Woman Speaking Foreign Language ] THAT'S NICE. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT. WHY DON'T YOU BUY IT FOR YOUR WIFE ? NOT REALLY HER TASTE. MY DAUGHTERS WOULD LIKE THESE, THOUGH. [ Chuckling ] DO YOU LIKE IT ? NO, I DON'T. I NEVER DRANK ANYTHING OUT OF A BAG BEFORE. [ Laughs ] IT'S RATHER AWFUL, I'D SAY. IT WAS WORTH A TRY, THOUGH. MAY I ? THANKS. THEY HAVE COCA-COLA. OR IS THAT TOO WESTERN FOR YOU ? [ Scoffs ] DON'T MAKE ME OUT TO BE SOME SORT OF CULTIST. IT'S NOT ABOUT THINGS. WHAT'S IT ABOUT, THEN ? DO THE, UH, FILIPINO PEOPLE HAVE A BETTER TAKE ON LIFE... THAN THE RESIDENTS OF LONDON ? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT STUDYING THEIR MINDS, I'M TRYING TO EXPLORE MY OWN-- AND YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT THROUGH REAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DO... IN PLACES LIKE LONDON OR L.A. ? WELL, I FOUND IT EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT. EXPERIENCE IS COMPLETELY PREPACKAGED FOR US. EVERYTHING EVER KNOWN, FROM WITTGENSTEIN, TO MUDDY WATERS TO THE TOMBS OF THE PHARAOHS, IS INSTANTLY ACCESSIBLE ON-LINE. [ Scoffs ] ISN'T THAT THE GLORY OF THE INFORMATION AGE ? WE'VE BECOME INFORMATION HUNTERS AND GATHERERS, AND WE KEEP GORGING OURSELVES UNTIL WE COLLAPSE... UNDER THE WEIGHT OF OUR OWN HEADS. I SOUND RIDICULOUSLY POMPOUS. WHY ARE YOU LETTING ME GO ON THIS WAY ? I'M ENJOYING LISTENING TO YOU. LOOK, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF SHARING IT WITH A STRANGER. MAYBE YOU JUST HAD A REAL EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE VERY SURE OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU ? I THINK... WOMEN FIND IT EASY TO TALK TO ME BECAUSE... I ENJOY LISTENING TO THEM. SO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN EXPERT ON WOMEN. NO. I HAVE SOME INFORMATION, BUT... I DON'T UNDERSTAND WOMEN AT ALL. I'M STILL SEEKING THAT EXPERIENCE. WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING, PILGRIM ? INTENSITY. WHAT ELSE ? IT IS YOUR FUCKING PLAN THAT HAS FUCKED UP THE WHOLE FUCKING GENERATION. [ Bells Jingling ] 'CAUSE I TRAVEL. IT'S MY WAY OF LIFE. BUT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. NO, NO. I DO. REALLY. [ Speaking Indistinctly ] MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM. WHAT ? THE COLLAPSE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ? UH-HUH. IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT, THAT MEN ARE THE ONES WITH NO CERTAINTY LEFT ? WOMEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SO DELUDED BY THE CANONS OF POP SOCIOLOGY-- IT'S LIKE SCRIPTURE FOR THEM, PRESCRIBING THE PATH TO THE PERFECT LIFE, HOW IT ALLSHOULDBE. IT'S ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. WHAT ? I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST HEARD THAT FROM A WOMAN. [ Laughs ] YOU DIDN'T. YOU HEARD IT FROM ME. WE'RE ATTRACTED ENOUGH TO EACH OTHER... TO GET INTO BED RIGHT NOW, AREN'T WE ? THERE'S A SUDDEN LEAP. PLAYING COY DOESN'T REALLY WORK FOR YOU, YOU KNOW. THAT'S TRUE. ANDY, TELL ME WHAT YOU'D LIKE FROM ME. WHAT I'D LIKE FROM YOU ? YEAH. LET'S TRY AND AVOID ALL THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS. TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D WANT ME TO DO... TO YOU, FOR YOU, WITH YOU. WELL, THAT WOULD TAKE AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF TRUST. AND TRUST TAKES TIME. YEAH. I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU FEEL LIKE... YOU'VE GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, HUH ? I SUPPOSE YOU DO. I BELIEVE THAT TRUST EITHER HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE, OR IT STARTS OUT WRONG... AND YOU CAN NEVER MAKE IT RIGHT. IT IS SARTRE WHO SAID THAT. UH-HUH. OR KIERKEGAARD. YEAH. I THINK. ABOUT THIS WHOLE HUMAN CONDITION. NO ? OH, YEAH. NO, NO. EXACTLY. YOU KNOW WHAT ? WE COULD KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS... IN MY ROOM. IT'S KIND OF LATE. YEAH, REALLY LATE. MAYBE I SHOULD GO HOME, HUH ? NO. KEEP TALKING TO ME. IT'S PRETTY LATE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. TALK TO ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ? TELL ME WHAT A MAN REALLY WANTS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHER MEN, BUT FOR ME IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. FROM THE MOMENT I OPEN MY EYES, ALL I LONG FOR IS A WOMAN'S SMILE. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THAT MATTERS TO ME, THAT AFFIRMATION. I SEE. I'M LISTENING. BUT IT'S THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR A WOMAN TO GIVE, BECAUSE THEN HER LOVE... WOULD TRULY BE FREE. A WOMAN'S POWER COMES FROM HOLDING BACK. THE MOMENT SHE COMES ACROSS WITH HER BODY, SHE HAS NO POWER LEFT AT ALL. BUT SHE CAN ONLY HOLD OUT HER BODY FOR SO LONG, SO SHE HOLDS OUT SOMETHING ELSE TO BARGAIN WITH LATER-- HER HEART. BUT WHAT DOES SHE WANT IN RETURN ? I NEVER KNEW A WOMAN WHO KNEW. OR IF SHE DID, KNEW HOW TO TELL ME. FOR IF SHE DID, I'D GIVE IT TO HER IN A SECOND... FOR HER HEART. WOULD YOU GIVE A WOMAN WHAT SHE WANTS, IF YOU KNEW SHE WANTS NOTHING AT ALL ? THAT ALL SHE REALLY WANTS... IS TO GIVE HERSELF... AND NOT BE TAKEN PRISONER ? THAT SHE CAN COME... AND THEN GO ? COULD YOU GIVE A WOMAN THAT ? CAN ANY MAN ? UGH. I SWEAR TO GOD, AFTER LISTENING TO HER BABBLE ALL NIGHT LONG, SHE DIDN'T EVEN TURN ME ON, ALL RIGHT ? WHY DIDN'T I JUST GO STICK MY DICK IN THE SINK ? ISN'T THE LIFE FORCE COMPELLING ? WHY DO THEY GET OFF ON TORTURING US ? I DON'T THINK THEY TAKE IT THAT SERIOUSLY. WE'RE JUST MILD AMUSEMENT FOR THEM. IS ANDY LIKE THAT TOO ? NO. NOT EXACTLY. [ Chuckling ] OH, SHIT. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING BACK TO MANILA. YOU MEET ME WHEN YOU WANT. WHAT ? DON'T BE STUPID. WE'LL BOTH GO BACK. - WHAT ABOUT HER ? - WHATABOUTHER ? WE'LL GO BACK TO THAT WHOREHOUSE, ONLY THIS TIME WE'LL SKIP THE HALLUCINATIONS. ALL RIGHT ? COME ON, THIS TRIP IS ABOUT US. I'M SORRY I DISAPPEARED EARLIER. THINGS DIDN'T GO VERY WELL WITH MARTY AND ILSA LAST NIGHT. SO I GATHERED. SHE LEFT ON THE MORNING BUS. MARTY TAKES THINGS METAPHYSICALLY. IT'S ALL THAT EASTERN PHILOSOPHY FROM HIS COLLEGE DAYS. I WISH IT WERE ONLY UP TO ME, BUT-- I'M NOT ASKING ANYTHING FROM YOU. THAT'S WHAT WE PROMISED EACH OTHER, REMEMBER ? I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT-- THAT YOU'RE NOT A GOOD GUY ? WE'RE LEAVING TOMORROW. WELL, IT WAS A PERFECT NIGHT. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR ? I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, LATER. [ Andy ] SO, JEFFREY SAID YOU ONCE STUDIED ORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY ? YEAH. FOUR YEARS. AGONIZING OVER WHETHER YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR MIND BY JUST READING THE STUFF, OR WHETHER, SOMEHOW, YOU HAD TO GO OUT AND DO IT. [ Laughs ] I NEVER FIGURED IT OUT. WELL, IT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE. I READ SANSKRIT AT OXFORD. YOU DID ? YEAH. I HAD A FEELING ABOUT YOU. I'M ONE OF THOSE. [ People Chattering ] TWENTY YEARS OF FIDELITY... TO MY WIFE, NOT EVEN A ONE-NIGHT STAND ON A BUSINESS TRIP, AND I FINALLY GO FOR IT. I MEAN, SHE'S SWEDISH. YOU KNOW, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A TWO-FOOT PUTT, BUT I GET BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER. [ Laughing ] GOD. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. TELL ME THE TRUTH. WE'RE PALS, RIGHT ? PALS. WHAT IS IT ABOUT JEFF THAT TURNS WOMEN ON ? WOMEN, OR ME SPECIFICALLY ? WELL, YOU DID SLEEP WITH HIM HOURS AFTER MEETING HIM. I'M THE LITTLE SLUT. NO. NO, YOU'RE HARDLY THE FIRST. OH, THANKS A LOT. NO, NO, NO. WHAT-- BUT WHAT-- WHAT ATTRACTED YOU ? HE'S TUNED IN TO ONE'S MIND... IN A WAY THAT IS EXTREMELY SEDUCTIVE. AND AT THE SAME TIME, HE'S SO DISTANT THAT I SUPPOSE HE PRESENTS A CHALLENGE. ISN'T LIFE CHALLENGING ENOUGH ? [ Laughs ] I MEAN, ISN'T SEX SUPPOSED TO BE... THE ONE THING IN LIFE THAT'S EASY ? AM I THE ONLY HUMAN ON THE PLANET... THAT'S DYING TO CRAWL OUT OF MY SKIN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ? NO, YOU'RE NOT. SO, W-- WAS IT GOOD WITH JEFF ? I MEAN CHALLENGING. I'M SORRY. IT'S-- I HADN'T BEEN WITH A GUY IN OVER A YEAR. AND I SUPPOSE WE MADE IT COMPLICATED, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE. JEFF'S NOT ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT'S IN FRONT OF HIM. MEANING ? IF I HAD SPENT THE NIGHT WITH YOU, I WOULDN'T HOP ON THE NEXT BUS. THAT'S VERY SWEET. SCREW SWEET, I'D LIKE TO JUMP YOUR BONES. PROBABLY DO US BOTH A WORLD OF GOOD. SINCE WE'RE PALS, UH, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING ? YEAH. IS THIS LIKE A MERCY FUCK ? WELL, CONSIDERING THE AGONY... MEN EXPERIENCE OVER GETTING IT, AND THE DEVASTATION THEY ENDURE IF THEY FAIL, FOR A WOMAN, MOST FUCKS ARE MERCY FUCKS. BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DETRACT... FROM THE PLEASURE OF IT. GOD, YOU REALLY ARE A PAL. [ Bells Jingling ] REMAINS TO BE SEEN. [ Chuckles ] [ Andy Moaning ] [ Moaning ] OH, MARTY. MM. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. AND IT WASN'T JUST A PHYSICAL THING, YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S-- PLEASE. WHAT ? YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HER. I DO. WHY DO YOU THINK I WANTED TO LEAVE ? DAMN IT. HEY, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU. IT'S A WONDERFUL ENDING TO OUR LITTLE ADVENTURE. ENDING ? THAT WAS THE GREATEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. SO NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO PLAY THE THIRD WHEEL ? MAYBE THERE IS NO THIRD WHEEL. WHO KNOWS WHERE THIS COULD GO FOR US ? [ Chattering, Laughing ] THIS IS GORGEOUS, ISN'T IT ? YES, INDEED. WE'LL BE BACK FOR YOU BEFORE SUNSET. MARTY. YEAH. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. WHERE DID 20 YEARS OF "CAREFUL" EVER GET ME ? YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. YEAH, FOR THE FIRST TIME. HEY, WHAT DO YOU NEED, A STARTING PISTOL ? COME ON, GET IN HERE. COME ON. OH, LOOK. SPENCER TRACY. HEY, IT'S BANDE. IT'S KOZAN. WHO ? JESUS CHRIST ! HE'S A BUDDHIST MONK. COME HERE. THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET. [ Andy ] HE'S PRACTICALLY A LEGEND OUT HERE. [ Marty ] YEAH ? [ Andy ] HE LEFT AMSTERDAM AND SPENT THE '60s... IN A ZEN MONASTERY IN THE MOUNTAINS OF JAPAN. HE DISCOVERED THIS PLACE. HE'S TRAVELED EVERYWHERE, CLIMBED IN THE HIMALAYAS, [ Chuckling ] LIVED WITH TRIBES IN NEW GUINEA. BUT EVERY FEW YEARS, HE DISAPPEARS BACK TO THE MONASTERY. AND HE WAS A GOOD LOVER ? YEAH, WONDERFUL. AND WE'RE STILL GOOD FRIENDS. [ Bande Shouting ] HEY, I'M THERE. [ Laughing ] COME ON. FOLLOW ME. LOOK. IMAGINE... BUILDING A PLACE RIGHT THERE. YOU MEAN A LITTLE HOUSE ? NO. SOMETHING MUCH MORE THAN THAT. WHAT ? A RESORT ? HERE ? A REFUGE. A HAVEN FOR KINDRED SPIRITS. A KIND OF SENSUAL MONASTERY AT THE END OF THE WORLD. EXACTLY. [ Marty ] YOU'VE REALLY BEEN A MONK FOR 30 YEARS ? THEY SAY IT'S FOR LIFE. I'M A THICK-HEADED DUTCHMAN, SO I BELIEVE THEM. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEACHER. WHAT TO SAY ? HE'S MAYBE FIVE FOOT, HAS DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS, AND GIVES ME A HARD TIME. WELL, WHAT EXACTLY ARE HIS TEACHINGS ? HE ASKS ME THAT ALL THE TIME. "SHOW ME WHAT YOU KNOW." WHEN HE GETS DISGUSTED WITH ME, HE THROWS ME OUT-- WON'T LET ME COME BACK FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND THEN SAYS, "ARE YOU AS STUPID AS THE LAST TIME ?" WOW ! LIKE ONE OF THE OLD MASTERS. [ Chuckles ] NOT SO ENTERTAINING IN REAL LIFE. [ Women Speaking Foreign Language, Children Laughing ] [ Explosions ] WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE TONIGHT, MARTY ? ANYONE BUT ME. PERFECT. THAT'S WHAT THIS FESTIVAL IS ALL ABOUT. THE MASK REMINDS US... THAT OUR PERSONALITY IS CREATED BY OUR MINDS. BENEATH THE MASK, ORIGINAL FACE. ???? [ Philippine March ] ???? [ Band Continues ] ] ????

I LOST MY MIND 20 YEARS AGO, AND I'VE BEEN HANGING ON BY MY FINGERNAILS EVER SINCE. 'CAUSE IT ALL MATTERS. BUDDHA HAD IT COLD. FIRST NOBLE TRUTH-- IT'S ALL SUFFERING. AND THE SOURCE OF THAT SUFFERING ? IT'S CALLED ATTACHMENT. AND THAT MEANS SHIT MATTERS. FOR 20 YEARS, WHEN DEALS FELL THROUGH, WHEN BETH WOULDN'T PUT OUT, WHEN THE KIDS TURNED INTO LITTLE SHITS-- EVEN THOUGH I'D BOUGHT THEM EVERYTHING-- IT ALL MATTERED. WHY ? BECAUSE THIS TERRIFIED, NAKED ASSHOLE NAMED ME... KEPT TRYING TO MAKE THE WORLD WORK... SO THAT NO ONE WOULD THINK I WAS A FUCKUP. THIS IS STARTING TO SOUND FAMILIAR. THEN WHY ARE WE LIVING THIS WAY ? WHY ? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY I'M LOSING MY MIND. BUT WE REALLY TRIED. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE WAS A FAILURE OF WILL. WE'RE DEFECTIVE. WE WERE BORN THIS WAY. THAT'S WHY WE WOKE UP IN A FUNKY, TROPICAL HOTEL... WITH A NAKED, 29-YEAR-OLD GIRL, WE ACTUALLY FELT SANE. THAT'S TRUE. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW ? WHAT DO YOU THINK ? ME AND BETH WILL GET A DIVORCE. BIG DEAL. HALF OUR FRIENDS ARE SPLIT. WIFE GETS THE HOUSE, GUY GETS THE CONDO. WORKS HARDER TO PAY FOR TWO HOUSES. THE STUPID WEEKENDS WITH THE KIDS, LOOKS FOR DATES-- THAT'S THE SCRIPT, ISN'T IT ? PRETTY MUCH. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU AND FRANNY WILL LAST ? I HAVE NO IDEA. FRANNY WILL WALK OUT ON YOU IN LESS THAN A YEAR. YOU WANNA BET ? OH, SHUT UP, MARTY. WILL YOU ? WELL, WE'RE BOTH FUCKED. I JUST WANT TO GET THAT POINT STRAIGHT. IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT, DON'T YOU THINK ? LET'S GO BACK TO LAKE TOVA. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ? ANOTHER WEEK ? HOW ABOUT FOREVER ? WE MADE OUR OWN HELL. WE COULD MAKE OUR OWN PARADISE. YOU WANT TO BUILD THAT RESORT ? NO, NOT A RESORT. I WANT TO BUILD A PLACE WHERE THE ANDYS AND KOZANS OF THE WORLD... CAN DROP IN ON OUR LIVES AND DANCE TO THE MUSIC. UH-- A TEMPLE OF SANITY. LOOK, YOU'RE THE GREAT MYSTIC. WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE GUYS WERE DOING... WITH THEIR PYRAMIDS AND THEIR NOTRE DAMES AND THEIR MACHU PICCHUS ? THEY WERE TRYING TO CLIMB UP AND KISS THE SKY. BUT THAT ISLAND, THAT SPOT OF OURS, IT'S AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET. OH, GOD, MARTY. AFTER 20 YEARS OF MEANINGLESS SHIT, LET'S DO SOMETHING THAT MATTERS. AND JUST WALK OUT ON OUR FAMILIES ? HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MANAGE ? DON'T YOU HAVE ENOUGH DOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF BETH? WELL, THERE'S A BUY-OUT CLAUSE IN MY LAW FIRM. I COULD... PAY OFF THE HOUSE, SEND THE KIDS TO COLLEGE. AND, WHAT WOULD-- WHAT WOULD SHE LIVE ON ? MY RETIREMENT MONEY-- WHICH IS WAITING FOR ME TO GROW FEEBLE. THAT'S PERFECT. FRANNY'S CAREER IS IN HIGH GEAR. SHE'LL FIND ANOTHER GUY IN A HEARTBEAT. I MEAN, SHE'S A HUNTER. SHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE. THEY REALLY WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT US. OF COURSE THEY WOULD ! ALL'S WE NEED IS LIKE, TWO HUNDRED GRAND. WE CAN TALK TO THE MATEOS. SCREW THEM. I'VE GOT "FUCK YOU" MONEY. YES ! GOD BLESS YOU, MARTY. I KNEW YOU WOULD. WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS AGAIN. IT'S SANTA CRUZ ALL OVER AGAIN. JESUS, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ? IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO SPEND WEEKENDS WITH THE KIDS. YEAH, I KNOW. AND YOU COULD-- YOU COULD JUST LEAVE THEM ? I NEVER LOVED ANYBODY AS MUCH AS I LOVE THOSE GIRLS. I CAN SIT AND STARE AT THEM FOR HOURS WHILE THEY READ A BOOK. FUCK, I STILL LOVE FRANNY. I STILL WANT TO TEAR HER CLOTHES OFF EVERY TIME I SEE HER. I STILL LAUGH AT HER JOKES. I LOVE THEM, MARTY. BUT I'VE GOT TO MAKE A WORLD THAT I CAN LIVE IN OR I'M GOING TO DIE. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. PLEASE, LET'S DO THIS. ANDY WILL DO IT WITH US. AW, COME ON. IT'D BE LIKE ANOTHER ADVENTURE FOR HER. A COUPLE OF OLD, CRAZY GUYS. YOU THINK ? SO HOW OLD IS SHE, JEFF ? WHERE DID YOU MEET HER ? WHERE IS SHE FROM ? THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. OF COURSE IT IS, JEFF. I KNOW YOU. NO, YOU DON'T. THAT'S OUR PROBLEM. OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT SHIT. LOOK, CAN I SPEAK TO THE GIRLS ? YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THEM ? YOU SPEAK TO YOUR LAWYERS. THERE IS NO LAWYER. THERE'S A FAX FOR YOU AT YOUR OFFICE. EVERYTHING'S YOURS, FRANNY. I DO KNOW YOU, JEFF. YOU'RE AN UNBELIEVABLE BASTARD. [ Line Clicks ] [ Marty ] IT'S AMAZING HOW BETH GOT OVER HER HYSTERICS... ONCE SHE HEARD THE NUMBERS. THIS IS A BETTER DEAL THAN SHE EVER DREAMED OF. IT'S WEIRD. WE EVEN TALKED ABOUT HOW THE BOYS WOULD LOVE VISITING ME OUT HERE. I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL THINK OF ANDY. LET'S NOT BULLSHIT OURSELVES, MARTY. WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR ANDY. THIS IS ABOUT US. OF COURSE IT IS. JESUS, I DIDN'T-- ARE YOU STILL BUMMED OUT ABOUT FRANNY ? I'M FINE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. [ Laughing, Chattering ] [ Bells Jingling ] [ Laughing ] AH, SO WONDERFUL TO RECEIVE YOU AGAIN. HI, DAD. WE'RE HOME. [ Chattering Continues ] [ Bande ] WELCOME BACK ! AH, COME ON, GUYS. YOU KNOW, MARTY, BEFORE BUDDHA WAS THE BUDDHA, HE WAS A PRINCE WITH A WIFE, CHILD, A GREAT PALACE. BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE IT, SO HE SPLIT. AND WE HONOR THIS GREAT MAN... WHO TOOK OFF FROM HIS FAMILY. JUST LIKE YOU. RIGHT. A NOBLE TRADITION. I NEVER CONSIDERED THAT. SO WHERE'S ANDY ? OH, SHE LEFT. SHE LEFT ? JEFF ? MARTY ? JUST KIDDING. [ Marty ] BOY, THIS IS SOMETHING, HUH? [ Andy ] IT'S FANTASTIC. [ Jeff ] THE TOWER IS FOR THE VIEW. THESE ARE THE PRELIMINARY SPECS-- LUMBER, CONCRETE, SCAFFOLDING, GENERATORS. I FIGURE A LOCAL CREW OF A HUNDRED GUYS WHO KNOW HOW TO USE POWER TOOLS. BANDE, WHAT DOES YOUR BUILDER THINK ? [ Speaking Foreign Language ] OTERO SAYS, "IT'S POSSIBLE." ALL RIGHT. IF WE STAY ON SCHEDULE, I THINK WE CAN GET THIS THING UP... AND WALLED IN BEFORE THE RAINY SEASON. HOW LONG DOES HE THINK IT'LL TAKE TO GET THE CONCRETE FOR THE FOUNDATION... SHIPPED OUT HERE FROM MANILA ? [ Speaking Foreign Language ] MAYBE NEXT WEEK. OH, THAT'S PERFECT. RIGHT ? THIS IS IT, BABY. GONNA BE PARADISE. SO. WHAT HAPPENS NOW ? WE CAN DO THIS, CAN'T WE ? TOGETHER, BUT STILL REMAIN AUTONOMOUS ? NOT LOSE THAT SENSE OF OUR OWN FREEDOM ? INTENSITY WITHOUT ATTACHMENT ? WE'RE HERE. YOU'RE HERE. I DON'T THINK WE NEED ANYTHING MORE. YES, BUT BEFORE IT WAS SPONTANEOUS. WE WERE MAKING IT UP ON THE SPOT. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT HAPPENS NOW ? LET'S EXAMINE THE GEOMETRY. OUR LITTLE TRIANGLE IS NOT EQUILATERAL, SINCE MARTY AND I DON'T... FANCYEACH OTHER. NO. SO I BELIEVE THAT PLACES YOU, GEOMETRICALLY, AT THE APEX OF THE TRIANGLE. SO THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS... TO LET YOU BE THE LEADER. [ Bells Jingling ] [ Bande ] WELCOME TO BANDE'S PLACE. BY THE WAY, I'M BANDE BATARANGA. YOU'RE JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE. COME ON, FOLLOW ME. GOOD NIGHT THEN, DARLINGS. [ Knocking ] OH. SORRY TO DISTURB SO LATE, BUT THIS COMES ON BUS. THANK YOU. [ Franny's Voice ] JEFF, THE GIRLS WANTED YOU TO HAVE THESE PICTURES AND THEIR LETTERS. I THINK YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THEM. LOVE, FRANNY. [ Sighing ] THE APEX. [ Knock At Door ] YOU ALL RIGHT ? IT'S MARTY. IT'S THE FIRST NIGHT, AND I-I KNOW THIS WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN, BUT I'M WORRIED. WOULD YOU SPEND IT WITH HIM ? SO THAT'S YOUR SECRET. THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SOFT INSIDE YOU. [ Knock At Door ] I THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE TO JEFF'S. JUST TO SAY GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] OKAY. EXCUSE ME. COULD I BUM A CIGARETTE ? SURE. YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. ONLY MODELS. A FASHION SHOOT. SANTO'S MY PRODUCER AND HE LIKES YOUNG BOYS. YOU LOOK SAD. I MISS MY KIDS. SO DO I. THEY LIVE WITH MY EX-HUSBAND. NOT A VERY NICE MAN. YOU NEVER KNOW. HE MIGHT BE. MAYBE HE JUST COULDN'T BE THAT FOR YOU. YEAH. CAN I COME IN ? OF COURSE. I'M SORRY. THAT WAS SO STUPID OF ME-- WALKING IN LIKE THAT. WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR PRIVACY. OTHERWISE, THIS WILL NEVER WORK. - ANDY, LISTEN TO ME. THAT WASN'T-- - YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN. WE CAN'T REQUIRE THAT OF EACH OTHER. - I'M JUST TELLING YOU, IT WAS-- - NOTHING ? OF COURSE. THERE'S NOTHING. GOOD NIGHT. 'NIGHT. [ Hammers Banging, Men Chattering ] [ Jeff ] YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS. [ Andy ] WHY NOT ? IT'S A BETTER IDEA. WELL, YOU CAN'T KEEP CHANGING THINGS. WE'RE WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE AS IT IS, AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN POURED THE FOUNDATION YET. EVERY TIME I ASK WHEN THE GODDAMN CONCRETE IS ARRIVING I GET, "UH, MAYBE NEXT WEEK, SIR." WELL, IT IS A PROCESS. BUILDING IS NOT APROCESS. IT'S ABOUT CREATING EXACT, SPECIFIC PLANS, AND EXECUTING THEM PRECISELY. SOMETIMES YOU CREATE PLANS AND THE RESULTS ARE UNSATISFACTORY. MAYBE SHE'S GOT A POINT, HUH, JEFF ? AH. UH, DON'T TAKE HIM TOO SERIOUSLY. BUT IF HE'S SPOUTING NONSENSE, WHY DON'T YOU EVER CHALLENGE HIM ? BUILDING PARADISE IS DIFFICULT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO GLUM. WE'RE NOT GLUM. PARDON ME. THAT IS NOT THE ENGLISH WORD FOR THIS FOG OF DESPAIR ? KOZAN, YOU-YOUR ZEN MASTER, DOES HE EVER, LIKE, FEEL BAD ? AWFUL, AND COMPLAINS BITTERLY. BUT HE TRANSCENDS IT SOMEHOW, SO HE DOESN'T REALLYFEEL BAD, RIGHT ? I THINK HE DOES FEEL BAD. DEEPLY UNDERSTANDS BUDDHA'S OBSERVATION THAT ALL IS SUFFERING. BUT HOW DOES HE RELATE TO THE PAIN ? HE'S A MAN. LIKE US. DRINKS ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF SAKE. PAIN GOES AWAY FOR A WHILE. YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME. NO, MY FRIEND, NEVER. WE ARE ALL TRYING TO MAKE PARADISE. WHY ? WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS HUMAN LIFE THAT IS SO UNBEARABLE... THAT WE TRY ANYTHING TO MAKE IT BETTER, INCLUDING SAKE ? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? GIVE IT UP ? OF COURSE. OF COURSE WE MUST GIVE IT UP. WITHOUT GIVING UP, PARADISE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM US. BUT IT TAKES GREAT EFFORT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO, YOU MUST TRY HARDER. WE'RE NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO TALK. NO, YOU TWO TALK WAY TOO MUCH. - WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE INSTEAD ? - THAT WE GO TO MY ROOM... AND GET NAKED, THE THREE OF US. I'M NOT ENTIRELY OPPOSED TO THE IDEA, BUT GIVEN THE CURRENT MOOD-- AH. ALL STATES OF MIND ARE TRANSITORY. HUH ? NO, THAT'S OKAY. I'M FINE. FINE IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE. WAIT. THAT-THAT DOESN'T FEEL-- SORRY. MAYBE I'M TOO STONED. JUST GEOMETRY. I THINK I'LL GO. OH, IS THIS HOW YOU DO IT, JEFF ? WHEN IT GETS DIFFICULT YOU JUST LEAVE ? MARTY, WHEN A WOMAN SAYS SHE NEEDS TO TALK, YOU'D BETTER TALK. WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SCREW HER ? WHAT ? YOU SAID YOU UNDERSTOOD. NO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL. GODDAMN IT. WHAT HAPPENED ? I FELL INTO BED WITH THAT ASIAN PHOTOGRAPHER A MONTH AGO. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ? 'CAUSE IT WAS NOTHING. NOTHINGIS NOTHING. WHY DID YOU DO IT ? WHY DOES A DOG LICK HIS BALLS ? WHAT ? 'CAUSE HE CAN. AND AT LEAST WHEN A DOG LICKS HIS BALLS, IT MAKES HIM HAPPY. SUCH BLOODY RUBBISH. YOU EXPECT ME TO EMPATHIZE WITH YOUR PREDICAMENT ? YES. THAT'S WHY WE CAME BACK HERE. WE THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE ON THE SAME SIDE. YOU SOUND LIKE WHINGING LITTLE BOYS. ACT LIKE MEN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. HOW EXACTLY DO YOU DEFINE "ACTING LIKE MEN" ? JUST BE HONEST. JUST BE STRAIGHT. JUST DON'T LIE, FOR GOD'S SAKE. IF YOU'RE SO HONEST, SO STRAIGHT, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US WHAT'S PISSING YOU OFF ? I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. NO. YOU WERE WAITING FOR US TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU WERE DEMANDING THAT WE NOT ONLY FIGURE OUT... WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES YOU UNHAPPY, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY. WE'RE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. THAT'S OUR JOB-- TO ENTERTAIN YOU. OH, AND I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. YOU TWO HAVE BEEN UNBEARABLE... SINCE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING LAID. [ Marty ] LISTEN. WE CAN TAKE THE DRY SPELLS-- WE'RE USED TO THAT-- BUT BUSTING OUR BALLS, THAT'S THE DICEY PART. OH, GOD. THE INEVITABLE ACCUSATION OF BALL BUSTING. WOULD YOU PLEASE FINALLY DEFINE THAT FOR ME ? IT'S JUST ABOUT PLAYING BY THE RULES. AND THAT NIGHT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT OUR FREEDOM AND AUTONOMY, JEFF AND I, YOU KNOW, WE THOUGHT THOSE WERE THE RULES. OKAY, FINE. YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY BY OUR RULES, FINE. BUT YOU DON'T BOTHER TO TELL US WHAT THE RULES ARE THAT YOU PLAY BY. IF I ASK YOU HOW FAR DO I GOTTA GO, HOW HIGH DO I GOTTA JUMP TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, WOULD YOU TELL ME ? NO. YOU WOULD SAY, "JUST JUMP OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF, HONEY. LET'S SEE IF IT MAKES ME HAPPY." YOU REALLY DO NOT LIKE WOMEN VERY MUCH, DO YOU, JEFFREY ? I DON'T THINK LIKING IS THE ISSUE. - I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WAY WE'RE BUILT. - EXACTLY. THAT LUNATIC IN HEAVEN PLAYED A REALLY BAD JOKE ON US. HE TOOK THAT PLACE IN WOMEN WHERE PLEASURE AND DESIRE AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM... AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES THEM FEMALE LIVES, AND HE BURIED IT DEEP INSIDE, OUT OF SIGHT, NICELY TUCKED AWAY. BUT LOOK AT US. OUR DICK AND OUR BALLS ARE OUT THERE FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE. THIS IS VERY RICH. SOYOU'REACTUALLY THE VULNERABLE SEX. - YES. WE'RE TERRIFIED. - OF WHAT ? FAILURE. [ Jeff ] LOOK, FORGET ALL THAT... TOUCHY-FEELY, NEW AGE BULLSHIT. EITHER A MAN PROVIDES FOR A WOMAN, OR HE'S NOT ACTING LIKE A MAN. I NEVER ASKED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME. BUT IT SURE TURNED YOU ON WHEN I DREW UP THE PLANS... FOR YOUR LITTLE CASTLE ON THE HILLSIDE, DIDN'T IT ? WELL, THERE WAS KIND OF A WEIRD HUMOR TO IT. I MEAN, WHY CAN'T WE JUST LAUGH AT IT ALL ? HOW CAN I STAY HERE, WATCHING HIM SCREW EVERYTHING THAT WALKS, AND JUST LAUGH ABOUT IT ? YOU KNOW, I MAY NEVER FUCK ANYTHING EVER AGAIN IN MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE, GIVEN THE GRIEF FACTOR, BUT I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THAT. I DON'T NEED PROMISES. YES, YOU DO. ACT LIKE A WOMAN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. I DON'T WANT TO. I KNOW. [ Marty ] ANDY, LOOK. WE'VE JUST GOT TO BE STRAIGHT WITH EACH OTHER. WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT ? FROM ALL OF US ? SHE CAN'T TELL US WHAT SHE WANTS BECAUSE WE MIGHT GIVE IT TO HER. JEFF, DO ME A FAVOR. AT THIS SECOND, DO NOT BE A PRICK, OKAY ? I NEVER CONSIDERED IT THAT WAY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THIS WOULD GO. I DIDN'T HAVE SOME GRAND VISION OF PARADISE LIKE YOU. IT JUST STARTED WITH BOTH OF YOU-- HOW YOU MADE ME FEEL. DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAD FOUND THE FATHER OF YOUR CHILDREN ? JEFF, COME ON, MAN. DON'T LAY THAT ON HER. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE'S SAYING. THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE THINKING ? YOU DON'T THINK IT. YOU FEEL IT... SOMEWHERE INSIDE. AIN'T NATURE BEAUTIFUL. ANDY. FORGET WHO YOU WANT TO BE. FORGET WHAT YOU WANT TO FEEL. DID I HURT YOU ? OF COURSE YOU DID. THEN I'M SORRY. THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T JUMP BACK INTO BED WITH YOU, NOT THE WAY I FELT. THAT'S THE POINT, ANDY. DON'T YOU SEE ? HOW YOU FEEL IS NOT THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE OF LIFE. WE LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE, WE AGREE TO PLAY THE GAME, AND WE PLAY IT. WHETHER IT HURTS OR NOT, WE PLAY. WE CALL IT HONOR. OKAY, OKAY. TIME OUT. LET'S GET OUR HEADS TOGETHER HERE, OKAY ? PLEASE. MY HEAD HASN'T BEEN TOGETHER A SINGLE DAY IN MY WHOLE FUCKING WEEK. WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS. NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIND A DIFFERENT WAY. GIVE IT UP. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SOME MUTUAL TRUST. WHY IS THAT SO HARD ? I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY DON'T. WHY DID WE HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR WHOLE LIVES FOR THIS ? GOOD QUESTION. TO BUILD A HOTEL ? THAT'S PARADISE ? SOME STUPID BUILDING WITH NO PEOPLE IN IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH HUMAN BEINGS ? AND YOU NEVER COULD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MARTY ? NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HER ? SAME THING YOU DID TO FRANNY. ANDY. IF YOU WANT OUT OF THIS MESS, LET'S GO. YOU AND ME. ANYWHERE. WHATEVER FUTURE YOU WANT. YOU KNOW, THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE LIKE YOU AND BETH 20 YEARS AGO, DOESN'T IT ? HIDING BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS. DON'T PUT THIS ON ME. IT-IT'S FALLING APART 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T CHANGE. I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. I THOUGHT YOU AND I WERE FINE THE WAY WE WERE. I GUESS NOT. GODDAMN THAT SON OF A BITCH. WHY DIDN'T I CALL HIM ON HIS BULLSHIT ? [ Sighs ] BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO, MARTY. RIGHT. WE LOVE EACH OTHER. BUT I CAN'T GO WITH YOU. [ Sobs ] JESUS. YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM. THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE. HE WON'T DO ONE THING TO TRY TO MAKE YOU HAPPY-- OF COURSE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM. [ Sobbing ] YOU REALLY BELIEVE YOU'VE-YOU'VE GIVEN IT UP, YOU'VE FREED YOURSELF, YOU'VE CHANGED. AND IN REALITY, IT'S YOU. YOU'RE STILL YOUNG. IT AIN'T OVER. LIKE KOZAN SAID, YOU GIVE UP AND TRY HARDER. ?? MANY MEN HAVE LOVED THE BELLS ?? ?? YOU FASTENED TO THE REIN ?? ?? EVERYONE WHO WANTED YOU ?? ?? THEY FOUND WHAT THEY WILL ALWAYS ?? ?? WANT AGAIN ?? ?? YOUR BEAUTY LOST TO YOU YOURSELF ?? ? ?? JUST AS IT WAS LOST TO THEM ? [ Indistinct Chattering ] ?? OH TAKE THIS LONGING ?? ?? FROM MY TONGUE ?? SEE YOU IN A FEW DAYS. SEE YOU SOON. ?? WHATEVER USELESS THINGS THESE HANDS HAVE DONE ?? ?? LET ME SEE YOUR BEAUTY BROKEN DOWN ?? ?? LIKE YOU WOULD DO ?? ?? FOR ONE YOU LOVE ?? ?? LIKE YOU WOULD DO ?? ?? FOR ONE YOU LOVE ?? ?? LIKE YOU WOULD DO ?? ?? FOR ONE YOU LOVE ???? I'M WORRIED FOR YOU. WHY ? WE GOT THE CONCRETE. THE FOUNDATIONS WILL BE IN IN A WEEK. ME AND THE LOCAL CREW ARE FINALLY GETTING ALONG GREAT-- I'M FINE. I ONCE MADE THE SAME MISTAKE WITH ANDREA, AND I WAS NOT SO FINE FOR A LONG TIME. I MUST CONFESS, WHEN SHE LEFT HERE, I EVEN CONSIDERED GOING WITH HER. YOU'RE A DIRTY OLD MONK. THIS DRESS ONLY HIDES THE HARD-ON, IT DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY. SINCE ADAM, MAN HAS TRIED EVERYTHING... TO ANSWER THE WOMAN PROBLEM-- VEILING THEM FROM HEAD TO FOOT, CELIBACY, RUSHING OFF TO WAR. YET SOME PROBLEMS HAVE NO SOLUTIONS. THEY JUST POINT TO THE BASIC PROBLEM. GOD, I HATE THIS ZEN SHIT. ME TOO. MY WHOLE LIFE I SPENT CHASING WOMEN. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHASING GOD. AN EQUALLY FRUITLESS TASK. HE'S NOT OUT THERE PLAYING HIDE-AND-SEEK. WE HAVE TO EXPERIENCE FOR OURSELVES... THE TRUE NATURE OF THINGS. AND, FOR GUYS LIKE US, JEFF, IT'S A HELL OF A SEARCH. TEN DAYS SINCE YOU LEFT. IT'S SO AMAZING WHAT HE HAS DONE. THE CREW WORKS DAY AND NIGHT. HE LIVES HERE NOW. YOU MEAN HE'S GONE COMPLETELY NUTS ? YEAH. DID YOU AT LEAST GET LAID BEFORE YOU PUT HER ON THE PLANE ? JEFF, GIVE IT A REST. I GUESS I SHOULD TAKE THAT AS A NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. [ Scoffs ] CHRIST. - YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HER. - FELL RIGHT DOWN THE HOLE. PRETTY STUPID, HUH ? NO. AT LEAST YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH A GREAT GAL. YEAH. WELL, SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE, YOU KNOW ? [ Thunder Rolling ] THIS IS JUST A SHOWER, RIGHT ? THE MONSOON IS NOT FOR THREE WEEKS, RIGHT ? SOMETIMES MAYBE COMES EARLY. WHAT DOES OTERO THINK ? [ Speaking Foreign Language ] HE THINKS PERHAPS HE HAS NOT SEEN MONSOON LIKE THIS IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. [ Thunderclap ] [ People Shouting ] ?? I MET A WOMAN LONG AGO ?? ?? HER HAIR THE BLACK THAT BLACK CAN GO ?? [ People Shouting ] ?? ARE YOU TEACHER OF THE HEART SOFT SHE ANSWERED NO ?? EVERYBODY MOVE. ? YOU OKAY ? ?? I MET A GIRL ACROSS THE SEA ? [ Thunderclap ] ?? [ Continues Indistinct ] [ Jeff ] GO BACK TO WORK. WE NEED THOSE BAGS. JUST KEEP WORKING. GO ON. GET IN THE TRENCHES. I NEED THOSE BAGS OVER BY THE TRENCHES NOW. [ Thunderclap ] ?? I WALKED INTO A HOSPITAL ?? ?? WHERE NONE WAS SICK AND NONE WAS WELL ?? WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? WE GOTTA WORK. ?? [ Continues Indistinct ] WE'RE NOT DONE. NO. YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP WORKING. STAY ! NO, NO. COME BACK. COME HERE. NO. HEY, COME BACK HERE. WAIT, COME BACK. IF WE DON'T FINISH, WE'RE GONNA LOSE IT. ?? SOME GIRLS WANDER BY MISTAKE ?? ?? INTO THE MESS THAT SCALPELS MAKE ?? ?? ARE YOU THE TEACHERS OF MY HEART ?? ?? WE TEACH OLD HEARTS TO BREAK ?? ?? OH TEACHERS ARE MY LESSONS DONE ?? ?? I CANNOT DO ANOTHER ONE ?? ?? THEY LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND SAID WELL CHILD ?? ?? ARE YOUR LESSONS DONE ?? ?? ARE YOUR LESSONS DONE ?? ?? ARE YOUR LESSONS DONE ???? [ Thunderclap ] [ Groaning, Creaking ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Creaking ] [ Cracking ] WE JUST WANTED TO BE FREE AGAIN. WE DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THAT FELT LIKE. SURE. YUCATAN, '72. WE WERE NEVER FREE, WERE WE? NOT FOR TWO SECONDS. WE ARE SO FUCKED-UP WE CAN'T EVEN DELUDE OURSELVES ANYMORE. I TOO WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO PARADISE. NICE, DRY SPOT FOR A RAINY SEASON. NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE MONASTERY. BAD FOOD, COLD, DAMP. SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL. SOMETIMES IT IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL. CUT THE CRAP, KOZAN. HOW EXACTLY IS IT DELIGHTFUL ? SITTING IN THE MEDITATION HALL, FOR A SECOND OR TWO, THE VEIL LIFTS. AND THERE'S... THE UNEXPECTED SWEETNESS OF... NO COMING AND NO GOING. AND ALL THIS DISSOLVES INTO... A SINGLE ACTIVITY OF THE COSMOS-- BEYOND HOPE, BEYOND DESPAIR. AND FOR AN INSTANT, WE'RE NOT SEPARATE FROM THIS ACTIVITY OF THE COSMOS. WE MANIFEST OUR TRUE NATURE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST AN IDEA THAT DOESN'T WORK. DOES IT, FRIENDS ? YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME. MAYBE WE'VE CAUSED OUR FAMILIES ENOUGH PAIN. BULLSHIT TIME IS OVER, OKAY ? I KNOW IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING, LEAVING THEM, BUT... IF YOU THINK GOING BACK NOW-- THE WAY OUR HEADS ARE-- IS GOING TO HELP ANYONE, YOU ARE DREAMING. YOU'RE DREAMING. NO WOMAN IS GOING TO SAVE ME. NO TOWER TO THE SKY IS GONNA SAVE YOU. IT'S TIME TO ACT LIKE MEN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. NOTHING IN MY LIFE HAS EVER FELT THIS RIGHT. WE ARE FINALLY WALKING OFF THE EDGE, AND I CAN'T WAIT. LOOK WHAT I HAVE FOUND. SINGLE-MALT SCOTCH. GOOD PRESENT FOR MY TEACHER, HUH ? I'LL MEET YOU AT THE GATE, I GOT TO MAKE A CALL. ALL RIGHT. [ Ringing ] HELLO. [ Jeff ] HI. IT'S ME. HI. FRANNY, I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW IT WASN'T ABOUT YOU. IT WASN'T ABOUT THE GIRL. IT WAS ABOUT ME. UM, MARTY AND I ARE GOING UP TO THIS... ZEN MONASTERY IN THE MOUNTAINS OF JAPAN WITH THIS MONK. [ Chuckling ] SOUNDS CRAZY, DOESN'T IT ? NO, IT-- IT SOUNDS GREAT. REALLY, JEFF. REALLY ? YEAH. YOU THINK SO ? [ Chuckles ] I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, BUT... I GUESS SOMEHOW THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU. IT ALL FELL APART AFTER YOU LEFT, JEFF. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER YOU SPLIT, I-- I JUST FOUND MYSELF BOLT UPRIGHT IN BED AT 3:00 A.M. YOU KNOW THAT FEELING ? YEAH, I DO. FRANNY, I'M SO SORRY. JEFF, I KNOW WHERE YOU'VE BEEN. THE GIRLS REALLY MISS YOU. UH, I THINK YOU SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY... TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM TH-THIS SUMMER. I WILL. I'LL HELP YOU. THANKS. THANK YOU. I GOT TO GO. I'LL CALL AGAIN. GIVE THE KIDS A HUG FOR ME, WILL YOU ? - JEFF. - YEAH. YOU'RE NOT REALLY A BAD GUY. [ Jet Engines Whining ] [ Jeff ] ON THE PHONE SHE WAS-- I JUST THINK I SHOULD GO HOME. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? MARTY, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND CHANGE OUR MINDS. I DON'T SEE HOW RUNNING OFF TO THE MISTY MOUNTAINS WILL DO THAT. MAYBE WE'VE GOT TO GO HOME... AND MAKETHAT FEEL DIFFERENT. KOZAN, TELL HIM, WILL YOU ? THAT'S WHY YOU BUILD A MONASTERY... AS FAR AWAY FROM HOME AS YOU CAN GET. IT'STHE WAY. THERE IS NO "WAY," MARTY. DON'T MAKE THE MONASTERY INTO ANOTHER DREAM OF PARADISE. IT'S JUST A NICE PLACE. BUT YOUR OWN TRUE NATURE-- YOUR BUDDHA NATURE-- IS INSIDE OF YOU, WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT. HOW YOU REALIZE IT IS UP TO YOU. THANK YOU BOTH FOR MY TICKET. I'M VERY EXCITED TO FLY FIRST CLASS. IF I SEE EITHER OF YOU ON THE PLANE, IT WILL BE NICE. IF NOT, I DO NOT LIKE GOOD-BYES, SO, HAVE SPLENDID LIVES. I CAN'T GO HOME. I KNOW. BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GO. I'LL STILL BE SEARCHING JUST THE SAME AS YOU. I KNOW. [ Footsteps ] WHAT TIME SHOULD I GET THE GIRLS ? 7:00 IS FINE. DO YOU WANT ME TO PICK UP A VIDEO FOR TONIGHT ? YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. JEFF ? YOU GOT A POSTCARD IN THE MAIL. IT'S FROM MARTY. [ Marty's Voice ] EVERYTHING KOZAN PROMISED-- COLD, WET, HORRIBLE FOOD. THAT LITTLE OLD MAN IS AMAZING. I LOVE IT. GET THIS. KOZAN HEARD FROM ANDY SHE MIGHT BE HEADING UP HERE NEXT MONTH. HOPE ALL IS WELL. LOVE, MARTY. DO YOU WISH YOU WERE THERE WITH THEM ? [ Sighs ] I DON'T KNOW. RIGHT NOW, I'M HERE. I KNOW. SEE YOU LATER. OKAY. [ Children Chattering In Distance ] ?? I LOVED YOU FOR A LONG, LONG TIME ?? ?? I KNOW THIS LOVE IS REAL ?? ??
