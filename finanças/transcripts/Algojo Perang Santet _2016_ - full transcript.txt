Viewers, there are some unexplainable events happening around us in several places recently. A series of murders of top officials done by a method which is indigestible by our common sense. You can make the target become physically or mentally ill. The purpose of this witchcraft is usually for revenge. In my opinion, it depends on the intention behind it. Is it used for good or bad intentions? We can call this phenomena as teleportation process. People may call it witchcraft, but the law of physics have answered this phenomena. It's not a material that is being sent to the target but the character of the material. You can use material such as hair, photos, dolls, or any other sharp objects. So this witchcraft is actually real? Yes. -And it's usually used for crime? -That's correct. There is no such thing as supernatural events in physics. In physics, we can only research things that our eyes can see. The most important point in our discussion today is that people must be vigilant and aware that the most dangerous threat is the one that our eyes cannot see. ALGOJO -Dad. -Yes? Do you know where was your name taken from? Of course I do, son. Your grandfather loved to watch Wayang. That is why my name was taken from one of the Wayang characters. The name was Bima. Why did you ask that? Did you know that Bima was a very strong man? When Bima was my age, no one dared to fight him. Yes, but he is just a character in Wayang. It is only fictional. No, I believe Bima is real. I wish to become like him. Is it possible? Being strong does not always corelate with being good. Do you know where real strength comes from? It comes from here. From the heart. You must believe with your heart that you are strong. Okay? -Son. -Yes? Are you happy? I am happy. Good. That's good. -I didn't know about that. -I didn't know about that either. That was so cool. How do you know about that? -Yes, how? -You know I ranked first in class. We are just waiting for you. You want to be rich, right? I've told you from the beginning that I don't like this plan. My answer remains the same. My answer is still no. Don't be so stubborn, sir. A good person dies soon. At least good people will not create trouble for others when they die. We are playing clean. If there is any problem, I will be responsible for it. I am a clean man. There are no clean officials nowadays. Mr. Bima, you just need to sign the document. We will handle the rest. This is for your family's future as well. I will not feed my family with dirty money. Or maybe you need some "sweet items", Mr. Bima? What are you saying? Women. I want all of you to leave my house. Rats like you all are forbidden to enter my house. -Please. -Sir... being a clean man alone is dangerous, -It's better... -I said get out of my house now! Be careful, Mr. Bima. DIED FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION Do you know... whenever I see you... I always forget that I am sick. I forget about it whenever I see your cute face. I will surely miss seeing your smile. Some people are born with powers. The power becomes an inseparable part of the body. There are certain things that surely differentiate one thing to the other. There are certain levels of powers. Some can do many things. Some are only born with one power. My father was born with an astonishing healing power. Unknowingly, I can create a weapon within my body. Some can use it from a distance. Some have to stand in front of their target. Do you know... the girl I helped just now? Her name is Della. She is just 19 years old. She had been vomiting blood since last week. Suddenly a nail came out of her throat. That nail was sent by her father's business competitor. It's so cruel. There was a girl named Icha. She is also very young. She is a college student. She's obsessed with beauty. At the end, she tortured herself. Seeing all these make me sad. It seems that they think... they can take their beauty or money with them when they die. What's wrong with this country? I really don't understand any of it. It's crazy. This is like war. War against their own people. I know it is not easy. We who possess special powers must help powerless people. At least we can reduce their burden. And the most important thing... is that our spirit to help them should never vanish. It's a crazy world. You should be crazy in order to survive in this world. Sign this. Come on, sign it. It'll make us all feel happy. I would rather die... than take part in corruption. We will not murder you, we will murder your family instead. Yes, sir. Yes. Desta... crime happening in front of our eyes is common. The invisible ones are more dangerous. Your father died fighting against it. Now, I want you to stop them. I will do anything. I'll do whatever it takes to stop them. Is Mother's condition getting worse? Is it only you who can cure her? How about doctors? That is the form of my devotion towards your mother. I possess great powers with great responsibilities. Even though the risks are also very high. What are you saying? You will know when the time comes. INVISIBLE CRIME UNIT SPECIAL AGENT: DESTA BOBY BANDUNG TURMO JOGJAKARTA KUNTO SOLO WULAN BANDUNG PATIH SEMARANG What are you looking for in this life? A satisfaction? The satisfaction that you'll get... after you eliminate your father's murderers? Or a relief? Good people should only experience good things. Bad things should only be experienced by bad people. Not the opposite. Desta, this world... is not the best place for justice. I really loved your father... your mother. But sometimes... we'll feel better... if we can forgive each other. Desta. Where are you going? Remember... don't mix your job with your revenge. You are late. I am sorry. You always come late for every meeting. I am really sorry. I need to do lots of work for Mr. Patih. I need to finish them first. Okay. Now what? With your help, all issues have been solved. -Thank you very much. -Don't mention it. Wulan, let me tell you, I can handle all the government matters. Just don't ever forget about my share. Understand? You don't have to worry. Patih will never forget about that. Work with us. When all the problems are solved, the money will come. -Help! -Get out! Go! Quick! One by one, our partners are dead. How come we still don't we know who's behind this? We must be more careful. Why? Are you scared? I am not scared... but I have faced this person's power. We must be more alert. We must find out soon who is behind this. Turmo... I think this is our old nemesis. What are you saying? A person who really hates us. Who? Bima. Bima is dead. Bima has a family. His son. Iced Coke, please. Hey. Hey. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Just my drink. Your drink? Our star is here. -I looked like a rock star, right? -The superstar. Hi. What's wrong with your brother? -Why can't I say hi? -That's enough. -Moska. -Desta. Thank you for your help. This is my brother, Supra. -Supra. -Desta. We hardly meet people like us. That's Osh and this is my girlfriend Sabrina. -She's pretty, right? -What did you say? -Are you really? -No, I'm not his girlfriend. -Tell them the truth. Don't lie. -I don't know about this. These two really like arguing. Do you want to come in? Maybe next time. Thank you. -I have to leave. -Take care. Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa! Sir... I cannot accept that Dad got murdered like this. I understand. But you must see your mother. An eye for an eye. What for? Revenge. His injury is very bad. It will take time to cure him. I will continue again tomorrow. Moska. Moska. Moska. Where is Moska? I don't know. I have not seen her. Maybe she's still sleeping. You were waiting for me? What time is it? It's morning. You waited for me all night? Yes. Thank you. I am the one who should say thank you. And I'm sorry... to have made you exhausted like this. We've been saying sorry and thank you too much. But it's no problem. Both of them make our lives better. -You are getting better. -Of course. Look at that. -Now you try it. -Okay, let me try. You are getting better too. Luckily, your grandfather is a strong man. Yes. When I was a kid, my mother often brought me here to play. Where is she now? She is gone. Do you believe in heaven? I'm not sure. I haven't been there. I believe... heaven is sincerity. Later, when you seek for a girlfriend... find a girl like me. But without the sickness. Find a girl who can love you... understand you... like I do. Yes, Mom. Okay? I promise... when I grow up... I will make you proud of me. I promise. What are you doing here? Are you following me? Supra. Do you know... who is the person you and Moska helped yesterday? Your father is looking for him. And he is very dangerous for your father, you, and Moska. What are you saying? If you are smart... bring him to us. None of your business. Move! Moska, do you know who Desta is? What are you saying? Desta is the person Dad is looking for. Desta wants to murder Dad. What are you saying? Grandpa... there is something you must know. On the way home, I met Kunto and Turmo. You understand what I'm saying? Moska is actually... Patih's daughter. Moska. I really miss you two. In a few days, I will be celebrating my 60th birthday. I wish you two... will celebrate it with me. Where have you been all these years? When Mom got sick, then died, where were you? Whatever I've done all these years are for both of you. Supra... you are my only son. You should be helping me in my business. Luckily, Supra is here with me, so he doesn't become a jerk like you. Moska. Forget it, Dad, I know who you really are. It's impossible you are here just for that reason. The person you are looking for is not here. You better leave now. You think we don't know what you have been doing all these years? We are ashamed of your doing. Is there anything you taught us that we can be proud of? They are not here. I am still hoping you will come for the celebration. You will be safe there. Remember, Desta... don't let your mind defeat your heart. INVISIBLE CRIME UNIT INVISIBLE CRIME UNIT IS A CRIME DEPARTMENT HANDLING INTANGABLE CRIMES, SUCH AS WITCHCRAFT.

So important that he made you feel like this. He has used us and even lied to us. We have never asked him anyway. You are defending a man who intends to murder your father. The option is between your father and an unknown man like him. Sometimes I don't get you. Do you like him? Moska! Moska! Hey! Hey! Where are you going? -Desta. -This is not our problem. Sab, Osh, Desta is in trouble. I am sure the fire is heading to his house. -We need to be there ASAP. -Okay, just drive quickly. Moska, the fire is above us. Dad, you must stop all of this. Before Moska and my friends get hurt. I have warned you before not to interfere in my business. But you both never listen. That's Moska, your own daughter!
