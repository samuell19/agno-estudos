Police Department. No, no, lady. You don't know me. I'm the night man. I'm just telling you. I'm sorry but he's right. Sure, you got to keep that dog of yours muzzled. I know, but it's the law. But lady .. if you'd keep your shades down, you wouldn't be bothered. Put yourself in his position. What was he wearing, lady? Sailor hat, soft, brown eyes .. white socks. No, no. Just let him stay there .. sure. If he's quiet and you don't bother him, he's probably not very dangerous. What's the address? Alright. Craddock. Hello, we'll be there right away. Car number 27 .. a stolen motorcycle at 506 Allendale. Calling car number 14. Number one-four. A lost child at 72 Maple Square South. Number one-four, a lost child at 72 Maple Square South. Calling car number 38 .. We ain't very popular tonight, Eric. No .. another lost kid just come through for 14. Huh .. that's his third today. I hope he tells them the right kind of bedtime story. Lost kids are better than nothing. And they told me this was a live beat! Ha! We ain't had a smell of excitement all week. "Car number 91" - Here we are! "A skunk in the basement of 64-21 Moreland Heights." "A skunk in the basement of 64-21 Moreland Heights." You wanted a smell of excitement, eh? You're sure going to get it. Come on. What do they think we are? Big-game hunters? I tell you Joe, you'll change your mind. You had a tough experience, that's all. Oh baloney. I learned about women from her. Say, I wouldn't look at another dame if she was Ziegfeld's best. "Forty-seven. Number four-seven." "A nude woman at the corner of Elm and Barry." Hurry! Or we might lose her. "Nude woman at the corner of Elm and Barry. All other cars stay away." Hello, sweetheart. Hello Pat. Hiya big-shots. - Doing anything tonight? Go on .. before I forget you've got a wife and three kids. Put yourself into our car and listen to the radio. Well, you go stuff that radio. "Car Number 17. Cars number 53, number 77, number 17." "4 men murdered at 203 Vengetter Street. 4 men murdered at 203 Vengetter Street." Come on, clear us Louis. Step on it! Hey, who's that? - Cub reporter from the Tribune, Chief. Obviously, a sensitive soul. Where's the scene? Yes, sir. Right there. Hello Captain. I just cut him down. - How long has it been? Two days at least. That's the way you got to deal with ducks. They're too gamey at first. I'm going up to phone in my stuff. Who found them? I'm on the beat, Captain. Couple of kids come down to play, and ran out for me. Where are the kids? - Outside. Haley's got them. Alright Fitz, let's go. They were Dopey Boys alright. Turn them over. There's little Georgie. I knew he would get it if he didn't get out of town. Say, what's going on in there? I got a little dizzy I guess. I'm Ed from The Tribune. - From The Tribune, huh? Say, when will your paper learn that my name is not McLaughlin, or McSweeney? How do I know? - It's McCowsky. Lieutenant John McCowsky of the Homicide Squad. You understand? Okay Lieutenant, but what I want to know .. I pull a girl from the river, save her from drowning, what did your paper say? Just a mere passing flatfoot .. and me getting stuffed up with Catarrh. Sorry, I wasn't on that story. And last month when the ape man was loose and I knocked him cold with a 1,2. What did that paper of yours say? "An unidentified citizen hit him in the head with a brick." I want to tell you pal, it is not fair. They found a nickel in Maxi Grosberg's hand. We know who was behind that job. There are the other three, Captain. They wrapped their fists right around them. Baker, shake down this place and the street for what you can get. Come, Tom. Hey, wait a minute, Chief. I got to get a statement. What do you think about it? I think you birds will mess it up, and blame it on the Police Department. Fighting Jim Fitzpatrick and his happiness squad. He has a smile and a blessing for everyone. Mac. Where to, Fitz? - Gelli's. We're going to get the big fellow? - Yeah, we're going to drag him down. Good evening, Captain. - Belmonte here? - No, sir. Where is he? Riverside warehouse? - I think so, Captain. Where is Cholo? With the boss. Is the boss upstairs? - Mr Belmonte? You want to see him? - No, just came for the ride. Hello Fitz. What do you want? - Put on your hat. You too Cholo. I'm taking you down. Say, what's the matter? I'm sitting here peaceable, going over my accounts. Figuring out how many new customers you got. As the Dopey Boys aren't running booze now. Ha! That "Dopey" outfit? I don't pay any attention to them cheapskates. Not unless they try to undersell you, like Maxi Grosberg did. Then you string them up with nickels in their mitts. If someone topped them fellows, I know nothing about it, see. Now listen to me. - Ah shut it up. Come on, hurry up. Now, you can't do that! - Shut up! You want a massage? Let's get out. Look here Fitzpatrick .. you'll have to prove these claims. Listen shyster, save that wind for the courtroom. He'll be needing it. Hello Bill .. give me Pearson. Garfield .. 3808. Hey Jack, how about some chow? - In 10 minutes. I must book this fish. Stick up? - No. Indecent exposure. Come on. Honest mister, I pledge she don't do it no more. Please .. Oh, Sadie, I told him somebody put them things in my bag. You did? - Oh please, mister. The Chief asks directions to the Policeman's ball. And then turns down a one-way street, so what could I do? They sure keep climbing all over the Old Man. Listen to this. Chief of Police Burton should stop making speeches to the Rotary Club .. And have a private talk with the members of his bewildered Police Department. Five gang murders and 41 robberies in the last month with only one arrest. Look at Rudy Vallee .. hey! What do you know? Plenty .. Fitz is bringing down Belmonte again. [ Whistle ] Hello Ed, you want to hear the latest? - What's up? Your brother is bringing down Belmonte again. He thinks he can pin the Dopey job on him. No he can't. You know it and I know it. Just get himself in a lot of hot water and Belmonte will thumb his nose at him. Your brother's a fool if you don't mind my saying so. Oh smart folks, huh? - No, just my personal opinion. Well, I don't like your opinions. - Ah, just a minute, Ed. If I hear any more cracks against him, I'm going to swing on somebody. Well that won't help Jim any. - Okay. Hey, aren't you going to eat? - No. I don't want to see Jim outplayed. Hello Chief. - Hello. Is Craig in? - Yes Chief. Fitzpatrick come yet? - Any minute now. I'm sorry to spoil your evening, Chief, but I thought you ought to be here. Well, it's my worry anyway, isn't it? Let's hope he's got something on him. Did you pick up anybody else? Four of Belmonte's guns and a couple of others. Fitzpatrick, Chief. Alright .. bring in that other bunch, too. Ah .. so you're here again Belmonte. Yes, I'm here again. He gets his picture in the paper again, and that's that. I don't suppose you know a thing about this? Why should I know about it every time some lug gets knocked over? We don't want to know why you know. We want to know what you know. You ever see any of these men before? Look at him! Well? I've seen one or two of them around Gelli's, I guess. You .. do you know who this man is? Sure I do. - Say "yes sir" you mug. Yes sir. Everybody knows Sam Belmonte. I know who to make these lugs talk. Come down to my office. Come on. He ain't got no right to mess me around. These came from Pearson, Chief. Of course. Our old friend Habeas Corpus, eh? For the release of Samuel Belmonte, Pietro Cholo .. Frederick and James Whiteson. Henry Volesti and George Almer. - Let's forget those writs, Chief. You know I can't do that. Alright Belmonte, take a walk. But listen .. someday we'll hang a rap on you that you can't beat. Then tell this flatfoot to lay off me until that time will you. I'm getting pretty tired of being hauled down here. I'm no back door tramp. I'm a busy man. That's the worst deal we ever got. Just a minute .. throw those two in the tank. Ain't that sweet? You slap us in jail, but the big-shots go as they've got the price of a lawyer. They got out rich, didn't they? Now you want to hold somebody just to make it look good. I could have slapped it out of him in minutes. If you dig up some direct evidence instead of dragging him in here .. We wouldn't be made fools of like this. Ha .. the papers are going to pick this up pretty. Your sense of duty seems to be running away with you. Duty? It's a pleasure with him. He hates those two mobsters. I hate Belmonte's crowd. They're behind everything in this town that's rotten. I'll wipe them out if it takes hot lead. Hold on there, Fitzpatrick. I run this Police Department .. you take your orders from me on how to operate. Understand? Now run along and cool off. Yeah .. I'm afraid he's a little too hot-headed for that job. Jim? - Yeah, it's me, honey. Hello. - Hello darling. When will you stop waiting up for me? - When I'm too old to walk downstairs. Is Ed home yet? - This is Saturday night. How are the kids? - Fine. Mickey said he had a stomach-ache tonight. I found out he had to say a speech at Sunday-School tomorrow. And the twins? They get to bed early? Well .. - A picture show again, huh? Oh don't be such an old grouch. They went to the early show and were in bed by nine o'clock. Why those girls will be young women before we know it. What's the matter Jim? You look tired. Have you been working too hard again? Working hard, getting nowhere, I guess. - Now listen here, Jim Fitzpatrick. Everybody knows that you have more brains than anybody else on the force. Why don't you walk up to the Chief and tell him a few things? You ought to go up to him and tell .. - Come on honey, let's get some sleep. You work like a dog .. Hey Ed, hurry it up, will you? - I'm coming. I'm coming because my head is .. What a meadow-lark you turned out to be. I want to talk to you .. you heard about Belmonte last night, didn't you? Yeah, I can't get steamed up about him. Dopey and his mob had it coming to them. What kind of talk is that? - "English", teacher, "English". It shouldn't break our hearts if three or four heels get wiped out. Well, it was murder, wasn't it? And Belmonte gets away with it. It's a waste of time to pull Belmonte in. Boy, he's got this town sewn up. He's got the dough and the Pope. I'll put him on ice someday. - Get wise to yourself, will you. If you don't watch yourself, you'll be buggy-riding in a hearse. Then what will the kids do? Take it easy Jim .. take it easy. You wear a Police badge, don't you? - And I keep it polished, too. But with me, it's an 8-hour job and I'm not trying to reform the whole world. Jim .. you've got a one-track mind. Okay. I'm glad you spoke up. I've got a little favor I want to ask of you. Well go ahead. All I ask is: don't put yourself in a spot where you just get kicked around. Now, what's on your mind? Spill it and I'll do it. Now, that's better. I'm going to build up a case against Belmonte if it takes me five years. You being on the Vice Squad, you get around more than I do. Keep your ears open and tip me off to what you hear, will you? Start tomorrow morning. Right after the line-up. And another thing too. If you got more sleep .. You wouldn't look like you got out of a mousetrap. Now listen, Mister. You should have been in that mousetrap. Morning Mary. - Good morning, Ed. How do you feel? - Sure .. oh .. You and the kids have breakfast? Of course, the children have to go to Sunday-School. Where's the surprise you talked about? - Right here! They made them themselves, dear. Say, those don't look like pancakes. Oh .. they're pancakes? Well .. Ah, that's wonderful .. come on Ed, have some pancakes. No thanks. Nothing but black coffee. - Go on, have some pancakes. Oh uncle Ed .. - And they're all buttered, too. Oh, you made them yourselves? Oh well, that's different. Are they good, Papa? Some of them stuck a little, though. Well, they stick perfectly with me. They're wonderful. Aren't they, Ed? Oh yes. Gee, they're swell. Alright girls, you've had your success. Go and get ready for Sunday-School. Mickey's all ready. And there's some more in the kitchen when you get through with those, Papa. Alright, bring them in. Uncle Ed loves them. Bring us some ham and eggs, will you? - Up to you. Certainly. Well, the Old Man is going to put on a shake-up. Ha! A lot of pap for the citizens. I can see why they need it alright. I wouldn't mind getting a crack at this town for once. You haven't got your eye on the Old-Man's job or anything like that? No, but I wouldn't mind sitting in the Chief Detective's office for a month .. Dad, will you read the funnies to me before I go? Surest thing you know. "Where is those blasted kids?" Look .. he hits him on the head with a pail of water. Hey Jim .. the twins. - Huh? "Help, help!" "Where is that Professor? Those horn-swoggled kids .." Come on, Mickey. Oh, gee .. Oh, you both ate all your pancakes. Yes, they were fine. Run along now .. hurry back. - Alright. Goodbye, Dad. We're making some more next Sunday. - That's fine, that's great. Is that your property, Slick? - No. Okay, come on. You're all through. Morning Joe. - Morning Ed. That's all .. seems to be a depression on. What's the name? - J. Washington Pomeroy. Drunk. No property. Come on little fellow. Hi Pete .. Morning Ed. - Morning. Hey, wait a minute. What's the news from the wife? Say .. it came last night. - No. Yeah. Well, what do you know about that? Hey, by the way, what kind of a package was it? A boy or girl? A boy .. as red as a traffic light. - No .. Eleven pounds. - What a man. Hello Ed. - Hi, boy. Going up to the show? - What's on this morning? Well, there was a blond girl mixed up in that pay-truck robbery. We picked up a flock of platinums and we'll run them through for the driver. Can't you pin it on that Jenkins dame? - She'll be there too. We want to see if that dumb Swede driver can identify her. Come on up. Alright. Put them out. Alright girls, come on. Straighten up. I think that's her. You can't think. You got to be certain. She had on a different dress. What did she say to you? She said "which way is Randolph Street?" Hey you, next to the end. Meaning me? - Yes, you. Say "which way is Randolph Street". Which way is Randolph Street. Well, I don't know .. it don't sound like her. Hey you, with the black skirt. You say "which way is Randolph Street". Come on, say it! Which way is Randolph Street. - Louder! Which way is Randolph Street. - That's her. I remember her easy now. No, no! What are you talking about? I don't know anything. Let me out of here. Get out of here. I want to talk to you a minute. I didn't do it. What do you mean, anyway? I didn't do it .. let me alone! Let me go, will you .. I didn't do it. Hey, you on the end there. What's your name? - Mildred Beaumont. They called you Daisy Stevens back in St. Louis, didn't they? They did. Remember those six months you did for a pretty little extortion job? - I do. Where were you picked up? - Gelli's. What do you do for a living? - Stenographer. Working now? - No. What do you do for a living when you're not working? Look for work. That's all .. listen, sister. You're not walking around this town without being watched, see. Keep your nose clean. Hey Postman .. where's the Postman? Hello dear. - Hello sweetheart. How are you? - I'm fine. Where are the kids? The girls just went down to the corner to get some bread. I've just got time to finish this before supper. What's that? Why, Mickey .. - How'd I ever start this game? I'm afraid they must be bills, dear. Although the butcher's bill isn't as big this month as it was last. I'm awfully glad I changed. Mr Shaw is so cute. He says he saves all the best cuts for me. I suppose he tells everybody that. Oh, Betty Fordham is going to marry that Price boy after all. There .. thank goodness that's finished. Jim. Why Jim, what's the matter? From headquarters? - Yeah, after fifteen years. Oh, Jim .. Why didn't they do a good job, and send me back to walking the beat? Oh but .. Well, you'll still have your Captaincy. - Captain of what? Easiest Precinct in the county. Back to wearing a uniform again. Sitting behind a desk in a Precinct as quiet as an old ladies' home. Ha! Fighting Fitz! Oh, it's so terribly unfair. Oh, Jim .. Well, I guess we'll have to start moving right away. You don't mind, do you dear? Mama goes where Papa goes. You're swell, Mary. The kind that makes a guy want to go on. And don't kick me in the shin or I'll smack you right in the face. Alright Copper. How'd you come to think that one up? Why, you've got "Headquarters" written all over you. Smart girl, huh? Yeah, and I never got past the eighth grade. Well .. maybe you're bright enough to answer a few questions? Sure, if you don't ask them in Yiddish. Will you come in? - I'm right behind you. Come on in. A stenographer, huh? - Yeah. You must get paid well when you work. - Oh tremendous. How much does Belmonte pay you? I quit him at the end of last week. - Yeah? .. Why? Oh, I didn't like his ways. I don't mind taking orders, but there's one decision that's always up to me. Come on, sit up like a lady. I know that trick. Oh, unintentional, mister. Say, do you think I'm so dumb as to pull a gag like that? You might. You're built for it. - Thanks. Hey, where were you the night Dopey and his gang were strung up? Now, wait a minute. Let me see your badge. I might be mistaken about you. Gee, I'm clever. - Answer my question. Well, I was at Gelli's until 2 am. With a boyfriend who was so drunk he asked me to marry him. You got an airtight alibi, huh? - Yeah, and fifty people to prove it. Only don't ask the boyfriend, because he wouldn't know. You didn't know the Dopey Boys at all, did you? Listen. I may know some of the big-shots in this racket, see. But that's all. When I get a hunch they are going to start arguing, I step next door. I've got my own game when I play it. And it doesn't include helping to make somebody else stop breathing. I don't want any murder jobs hung on me. I once got a shock from an electric toaster and never quite forgot about it. Alright. - Wait a minute. - Answer this one. Wait a minute. Let's talk in comfort. I got some real swell beer on the ice. Sure, and a glass of some knockout drops for me. Why, you've got to stop going to the movies .. that's bad. You were going to leave me sitting there a long time, weren't you? I was coming right back .. honest. Say, that hurts a little bit. And you don't like to be hurt, do you? Oh I don't know .. It's kind of fun sometimes if it's done in the right spirit. Get the beer. So you don't know a thing about anything, huh? I know what every young girl ought to know. Well .. you got good beer. Look .. supposing I took you down on "suspicion"? You might tell a lot of things then. You wouldn't find out anything that would do you any good. Want a sandwich or something? I ate in the same restaurant you did. - Yeah, I know. I saw you up at the end, in the corner. - You did? How did you happen to notice me? - I don't know. You're not exactly a collar ad but .. Say .. what's your name? - Fitzpatrick. Not "Fighting Fitz" brother? - That's right. Now I can understand .. boy, you were so hard-boiled at first. Hey, does that brother of yours ever smile? I got to admit he does take things pretty serious. Are you married? - No. I thought all Cops were married. - I'll stick to variety. A girl in every Precinct, huh? - Yeah. Something like that. You know, it's a funny thing. You drink beer to make you cool. And it just makes you hot. I can't stand it. I got to do something about it. Hey .. if you want an eyeful, come here. Look. - What? Oh boy .. she certainly does know how to wiggle, doesn't she. That girl doesn't know how to dance. - No? No. I never thought I'd have a .. yen for a Copper. Are you going to try and reform me? - What for? Hey look .. the riot squad. Will you tell Captain Fitzpatrick a pair of "burglars" would like to see him. Go right in. - Hey, you're cheating. You've got a black Queen on a black King. What are you kicking about? They don't seem to mind it. Wake up, flatfoot. Hello Tom. - Hello Fitz. Hiya Chief. - Hi Mac. First chance we had to get out together, so we've run out and look you over. Gee, it's great to see you guys. The old detail ain't the same it used to be since they gave you the ax. I'll say it isn't .. we miss you, Fitz. - Don't kid me. Have a cigar. Thanks. - Look, he hasn't changed a bit. How's Mary? - Mary is swell. Say, it's kind of quiet around here, ain't it? We had a big week last week: 3 traffic violations and a stolen lawnmower. You know, it's a dirty shame the way they've side-tracked you like this. And that shake-up hasn't helped the Old Man a bit. He had a nice little visit from the Civic Reform Committee yesterday. And they pointed out that things were just as bad as ever. Yes, read about it in the morning paper. - Yeah, but here's the payoff. I got an office tip that they couldn't understand why the shifts had been made. And they named your case in particular. - I don't know what I can do about it. Say, you guys seen Ed lately? He hasn't been out to see me as often as I hoped. Oh sure, we see him around. He's been kind of busy, I guess. He likes his good times too. You know, he's not like you, Fitz. Well, Ed's younger. He'll make a good dick if he ever puts his mind to it. - Oh sure. [ Alarm bell ] It's the bank, Captain. A big stick-up. They blew the brains out of the cashier. Got the car ready? - Yes .. no .. the wheel is still off. Alright .. come on. Just in time for a party. Get back now .. get back. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. The bank cash is all out. Please don't let me see any more. Captain, they're heading up town. - Alright. Let's go. Which way did he go? - I tell you they took my car! Out this way! Head them off, Mac. Stick 'em up! Hold him Mike .. we're coming around. How about you, Fitz? - I'm alright. Come on. Don't bother about me. I'm alright. You call the meat-wagon. Did they clip you, Fitz? - Yeah, just in the arm. That's all. Take that guy down to the car. I had to drill the other one. You sure you're alright now? What are you trying? To make a sissy out of me or something? - No. [ Loud piano ] Children! Will you please stop that noise. Look! It's uncle Ed. - Uncle Ed! - Uncle Ed. Hello Mary. Hey, where's the cripple? - Right here. ? Hi, Jim. Hi kid, glad to see you. Look, daddy's shot. Isn't it swell? Why Mickey, how can you say such a thing? Well, it is swell, isn't it? - Here. Mary, you're looking grand this morning. - I feel fine. Well, you big baboon. They can't keep you off the front page if they put you in a straight-jacket. They've been kind of insulting you, haven't they? Mary's been reading me a lot of hot air. - It's not a lot of hot air. It's hysteria. Your name is being flung around headquarters like a pass to a Speakeasy. Oh by the way. The editorial in The Times this morning suggests you be the Chief of Police. I know. Isn't it exciting, Ed? - Oh, they write a lot of tripe. The Old Man must have been reading it. He's been down City Hall all morning. Mustn't come in, in case saw you sitting in his chair. That talk is foolish. I never hoped for anything that high. Are you telling me? - No, you're telling me. Where you been keeping lately? Busy? - Yeah, real busy these days. A junkie investigation. By the way, you never told me. Did you ever pick up anything on Belmonte? Why .. no .. It's funny .. he keeps pretty well covered. Haven't been able to pick up a thing. Yet .. But Burt, you see the point. You're an appointment of mine. I'd stand by you if I could, but every organization in .. I know, I know. But I'm being made the goat, that's all. I'm afraid you've taken things too easy. - Now see here, Fred. You know, this thing will blow over in a couple of weeks and then .. Burt, you could have made some little show. You needn't have let the newspapers get this far. Two months ago, you told me to pay no attention to the newspapers. But unfortunately, my name's been linked with yours too many times since then. I have got another election this Fall. Burt .. being Mayor is something like being on the stage. If you get too many bad notices, people stop coming to see you. Well .. I don't mind resigning so much but .. I shouldn't think you would. You're pretty well fixed, Burt. Well, I have been very careful about how I save my money. But it's just too ridiculous, that's all. Fitz is nothing but a tough, uncouth Irishman. He's liable to make things very embarrassing for you. A good politician never gets embarrassed, Burt. That's something you should have learned. Now that I've unnecessarily reviewed the brilliant career of Captain Fitzpatrick. I feel sure we shall all be very happy to hear him take the oath of office. I do solemnly swear to uphold the constitution of The United States. And the constitution of this State. And to discharge the duties of the Chief Of Police to the best of my abilities. Well .. I want to tell you folks that .. This is a great honor to me. And uh .. And I want to say .. That .. Broadcasting, eh? I never did that before. So .. Perhaps you folks would like to know .. some of the jobs I've got .. That is .. a few of the things that I've .. mapped out. Or rather, some of the things I have planned for the department. First of all .. We're going to start with a clean slate, see. I don't know a thing about any of you. Good or bad, efficient or inefficient. I'm not upsetting apple carts. Every man keeps the job he's got, until he proves to me he's worth a better one. Or that he has no right on the force at all. I'm not fighting you and you're not fighting me .. we'll fight together. Now this town has become about as rotten as an open grave. Only some of you have got so used to it, that you don't hold your noses any more. But we're going to clean it up, understand? We'll knock off any speakeasy, gin-mill, or wheel-joint from here to North Haven. We're going to keep puling in every monkey until .. They get so tired of it, they'll all want to leave town. Leave the country! Not the town, but the country! Each one of you is going to handle your own Precinct in your own way. You know more about conditions there than anybody else. What I want is results. If I don't get results .. There's going to be a shake-up like the inside of a cement-mixer. I'll get results if I have to put a patrolman at the head of the Vice Squad. And Precinct Captains back to teaching rookies drill. Alright now. Go on out and get to work. You'll get official confirmation on all orders before the day is out. No, no .. never mind those open hands. Close them up into fists and use them. Salute! Dismissed. Well .. they never heard anything like that before. That's the real McCoy. Say, do you know that guy Dixon of the 48th? Well, he's sitting behind me. "Say", says he. "He don't think he can close all the speakeasies in this town in a month." "Why not" says I. You close half of them every night. And did I laugh? You see I did. Well, we'll soon weed out his kind. If they were all like you two guys it'd be a cinch. We're behind you all the way, Fitz. - Now listen. You're both being attached to me as special detail. - Great. I'm going to start staging a few shows tomorrow night. And I want you to choose a flying squad of fifty men. I'm spotting the joints now. Let me know when your setup is ready. And am I needing the exercise? I'm getting so sluggish. If it isn't the rover-boys. - Hi Eddie, what's on your mind? Well, uh .. - See you later, Chief. Hey listen, Jim. There's a Lieutenancy open on the Vice Squad. Not yet Ed, you're not ready for it. - What do you mean, I'm not ready? My record is okay isn't it? - Yes, but nothing startling about it. Promotions have to be based on something. I suppose I have to go out and catch a couple of lugs robbing a bank? Now, throw away those sour grapes. That's not like you, kid. I didn't mean it .. it's just .. Well, it's only natural for a guy to want to earn a little more dough. You'll earn it in time. Just pay a little more attention to your job, that's all. What do you do with your money, anyway? You haven't got any expense living with us. Still running round with a lot of dames? - Oh what do you want of me? Now get wise to yourself and grow up. So I don't get the Lieutenancy, huh? - Not until you earn it. Just because I'm Chief .. you want me to make the department a family affair? Oh I see .. grandstanding. I'm a big, honest, guy I am. I wouldn't even give my brother a break. - Hey, now cut that out and go to work. You've got an assignment, haven't you? Alright .. if that's the way you feel about it. Now listen, don't get sore. Just show me what you can do. - What you want me to do? Card tricks? You've got to get another pint, darling. Quart, honey .. quart. - You sure know me, baby. Mike .. hey Mike .. Oh boy .. did I get you all wet? I've always been all wet, honey. I wish somebody would invent one of these bottles that didn't always fizz. I'll take care of that the first thing in the morning. Down the booby-hatch. It's pretty hot tonight. You're telling me? - No, I mean the orchestra. It's not as good as that one at Purple Lodge. Remember? Hey, let's go up there again this weekend. We never go anyplace any more, except come to this dump. Well I .. - Say, Ed? You aren't broke are you? If I hadn't loaded up on that 100,000 shares of steel before the crash I'd .. Oh listen, baby .. It's you and me all alone and nobody around. That's the real part of the act, isn't it? I know, but look at it Ed, suppose you like cornmeal mush too. Gets a little monotonous if you didn't add cream and sugar once in a while. I just like the mush. Come on, don't do that at the table, please. Sit back now. Come on, we're in public. Hello Jack. Hello Steve .. hello Tex. Well, look what the cat brought in. Hiya Sam. - Hello. I thought you weren't speaking to me. - Oh sure I am. Hello Cholo. Come on, sit down. - Fine .. Say, you boys know Ed Fitzpatrick don't you? Sure. I've seen him around a lot. But I guess I know your brother better, eh? Hey Giuseppe! - Yes, sir? Bring that champagne over, will you? - Very well, Mr Belmonte. We'll have us a real party, eh? - Yes, sort of. Do you hear that? Hey, I haven't brushed my teeth in bubbles for ages. Pretty nice about your brother getting to be the big boss, eh? Well, he deserves it I guess. He's a nice fellow, even if he has got funny ideas. Sure. And I suppose that now puts you in the velvet, huh? That's right. The Lord Duke himself. When's the promotion come off, mister? - That's another story. Not quite cold enough yet. - Let's see that it's ready next time. Thank you. That's mighty pretty wallpaper, Sam. Business must be good. Yeah, got a corner on the grapefruit market. How about those kegs of California orange-juice? You know it's funny about those grapefruits. They're being trucked in over the Huntington Turnpike. But it's getting bumpy out there and some of them are liable to get spoiled. So what? So .. I'll pay 150 skins a week to any man who can fix a better way in. Can't you come along Kingsford Avenue? - Can I? You can. Isn't my Ed a sweetheart, huh? - Your Ed is sensible. Give me that bottle. I want to get stewed. Quiet. Well. Sounds like the inside of a bird-store. A lot of fine, brave boys, aren't you. Come on, why don't you keep it up? The teacher is looking at you. Is that why? It would be different if you were hiding behind an alley door, wouldn't it? It'd be different if you had a shot of hop handy .. So you could pump yourself full of guts enough to shoot somebody in the back. Take away your guns and your hop and you're just crawling, yellow maggots. Now get this. I know some of you will beat your raps. I've seen your greasy lamsters outside, waiting with bail money. There's not one of you not filled with swill. I'm going to dump the whole lot of you before I'm through. I'm going to keep on knocking off your joints and dragging you in. I'm going to keep climbing up the backs of your dirty necks until they break. Alright. Now teacher is going to turn his back. So you can start yelling again. We got a couple of Belmonte's men in there. Get a hold of Max and go to work on them before the writs start coming in. Alright, Chief. Got any statement on that, Chief? No. Gentlemen of the press, you know the public better than I do. They put me in office for a clean-up, didn't they? You picked up a couple of influential citizens in that raid over on The Drive. Can I help it if some of our leading lights get caught in a joint? I'm after all the joints are breaking the law .. or anybody in them. Even the Civic Reform Committee? - Don't talk to me of those backsliders. Backing me for everything I do, eh? Yes. Only this morning, the Chairman calls up as we pinched his d?butante daughter .. For going sixty miles-an-hour through a cross-street. What's your answer to this "brutality" charge? What else can you do? What do you expect me to do with gunmen, dope peddlers and sneak thieves? Kiss 'em on the forehead, or slap 'em on the wrist? You can't expect to clean up the town the way things are, Fitz. You know it. It's like trying to bail out the ocean with a lily cup. Half of the joints you knocked over are running again. You've got to hang a rap on Belmonte before you can get anywhere. He controls everything. And he's got a barricade of graft around him that you can't get through. I'll stop Belmonte if I have to rip him up to do it. What do you mean? - Figure it out for yourselves. That's all today, boys. Tell Detective Fitzpatrick I want to see him. Good morning, Chief. - Goodbye. Hey there! - What's the matter? This is the worst yet. You start it right, but look! Look where you put it. "Detective Lieutenant John McCowsky .." "Leading a prisoner from last night's raid." Well, it is a mistake but .. It's a perfect likeness. - What? Hey, you son of a .. Hello kid. - Hello Jim. You want to see me? - Yes. Ed, I got a special job for you. - Shoot. Bartman Savings are moving cash tomorrow and they want a man to ride the load. I want you to handle it. - Sure. What's so special about that? - Plenty. They're not going to use an armored truck. They'll put all the stuff in filing cabinets and cart it over in a van. I see .. another one of old man Bartman's brainstorms? I tried to talk him out of it but .. He feels the less show of protection you make, the better camouflage it will be. It's a screwy idea. Supposing it gets tipped? That's why I'm sending him a good man. Come on now .. hop down there and plan your setup. Okay. I've just given Ed the Bartman assignment. He needs bucking up. Oh Fitz .. Mac and I are off tomorrow, but .. Well, wouldn't it be a good idea for us if we hung around the sidelines for Ed? Why? - Well, you see .. You see, this is his first real important assignment and .. We'd hate to see him muff it in case anything did happen. Sure, that's it. - Say, that's mighty white of you guys. Alright, go ahead, but don't let him see you. You know how he feels. Here it is. Thanks. How about a drink, Dan? Say, where's Ed? - He's in the bedroom. Say, what's the idea of turning hermit? Oh I'm sick of them. I'm sick of everything. You're not sick of me, baby. Sometimes I wish I could be, but I can't. You beautiful shot of hot! Well .. I'd better scram pretty soon and get some sleep. I've got one of those comic assignments tomorrow. So, you're going to put on a false mustache and get your man, huh? No, they signed me up as a nursemaid to a truckload of dough. Some guy's taken the vegetables out of a cellar and they're scared of rabbits. Is that it? They put me out on loan. My big opportunity or something. Hey, where's my coat? - Don't go right away, Ed. I came in here to tell you something. Here .. take a drink .. we're both going to need one. I'm going to get one for myself. I'll be right back. Hey, you think I'd be interested? - I hoped so. Go on .. stumble over a cliff. Oh, look Ed. - Listen! I'm an old man. I left my youth in the Capitals of Europe. All alone, huh? Do you think he'll do it? If he does, that's how I earn my share. Fine. Now you go in and get the works from him. ? Okay, Cholo.` Say, what about Belmonte? This isn't in his line, you know. Do you think he'll be sore? He don't have to know until it's all over, and it looks like a cinch. Alright, if that's the way you feel about it. Yeah, that's just the way he feels about it. Back to the bush leagues for you, sister. And shut the door from the outside. What did you want to tell me, sugar? I'm going away in a couple of days, Ed. I'll be right here when you come back. - Nope, I'm lamming for good. Hey, what do you mean? I'm just sick and fed up with this whole town. I guess I always got to be on the move. That's all. Where are you going? - France. A guy I know in Paris sent me the fare. I used to know him pretty well. You can't go with any other guy! If you do, I'll choke your eyes out! That's just what I mean. I don't want to go with any other guy. Honest I don't. I just want to be with you every minute. Oh come on, Ed .. come on with me, kid. Baloney to that guy in Paris. You know you're not getting anywhere being just a Copper. I got to have dough to go away. You got to have dough. What about that rake-off you get from Belmonte? Oh, that will stop as soon as I get out of town. Anyhow .. how far will that take us? Listen, Ed. You are in the racket now, aren't you? Not that it hurts anybody. I suppose that's what you call it. Then what about that load of cash you're playing nursemaid to tomorrow? You mean ..? That would fix everything, wouldn't it kid? Now listen .. that's just one thing I can't do. Even if it looks as though you had nothing to do with it? Oh gee, please listen to me, darling. And listen, when Joe and Ed come in, you tell them to wait. You understand? Yeah .. yes, I may have a job for them .. alright. Hey, it's twelve o'clock already. It will take a half-hour to get there and a half-hour to unload. You guys want to put on a feedbag before you start? Yeah, let's eat. Okay for this? Yeah sure, that's alright. I'll take care of it when you get back. Hit me hard. Stay with him. Hey! The kid! Did they hit that little kid? Yes. More speed Joe. We got to get out of here. Go in the front, Joe. You two head them off round the corner. This way, Mac. Come on Mac .. take the lead out of it. Mac! Mac, old man. Listen .. listen, Mac. Come on, Joe. Mac, old-timer .. let me see. Where is it? Never mind that. Listen Tom. Will you see that they spell the name right? Will you? Maybe the old lady .. Would like to save .. The clippings .. [ Buzzer ] Yes? "Detective McCowsky's funeral will be the day after tomorrow at two o'clock." "Did you hear, Chief? I said Lieutenant McCowsky's .." - Yes. Poor Mac. - I never knew. I mean .. I .. If he only hadn't been hanging around. They were covering up for you. I don't see how you fell down on it, Ed. "Yes?" Let me know the minute those two arrive. - "Just a second, Chief." "They're bringing them into your office right now." - Alright. I'm no good here. I can't think. My head feels as though it was .. You can't talk like that, sit down. You've got to identify them. Here they are, Chief. Abe and Joe Gorman. The Robbery Squad got their records from back East. We nabbed them over at Union Central buying tickets for the 8 o'clock train. Trying to lam out, eh? That's natural. You sure of these two? I saw them both full face, as the truck came up through the alley. Ask Ed. He can be surer than anybody. How about it, Ed? Are these the two guys? - Well I .. Oh, my head. I .. I can't seem to remember a thing, Jim. I was just standing there with a newspaper and .. then something hit me. You don't remember them at all? - I got to be honest, Jim. I can't remember a thing. Chief, I don't know nothing about it. I'm only out of stir two months. I'm trying to go straight. We'd been playing pinochle with a friend, over at aqueduct all afternoon. You two and a friend? Just the three of you? Yes, sir. That's right. - Playing for money? Yes sir. - Gambling, eh? Only friendly stakes. That's all. - Win or lose? I lost a buck and a half. - How about you? I dropped about 80 cents. - Your friend, how much did he lose? Six bits. Must have been some game. All three of you lost. There was another fellow .. - I don't want any more lies! Got a sap, Tom? - Right here. Now the first one of you who talks, will save himself from being busted to pulp. Take off those cuffs. - But Chief, I forgot to tell .. You forgot to tell me you hit an officer on the head. And forgot you shot a little girl down in the gutter. You forgot to tell me about killing one of the finest white men that ever lived. Take Abe in there and see how much he can stand. Now listen Jim, you haven't any proof. - I got Tom's word. Proof enough for me. You've heard of me, eh? - Yeah, I've heard of you. You've heard I'm pretty tough, huh? - Oh, I don't know about that. Had enough? Had enough? Oh! Come on. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. - It ain't going to stop. Come on! - Alright, alright .. I'll talk. Yeah, we grabbed the truck alright. There wouldn't have been trouble if them bulls had kept their pussies out of it. Everything was all set, see. What you mean "everything was set"? Who tipped you? Gee, I can't stand it Jim. My head. Who tipped you? Come on. Who tipped you? Who did this? He did, if you want to know! Your own brother .. how do you like that mister? Don't listen to him, Jim. - Yeah, he planned the whole works. He gave us the time and everything. - Shut up! Take him in there and get his signed confession. It's true? I can see it right behind your eyes. Alright it's true! I don't care. I wanted more dough, I wanted a promotion. You wouldn't give it to me! Stop! Dirty, murdering crook! Arrest Detective Fitzpatrick. Charge with murder. Extra! Extra! Chief Fitzpatrick's brother arrested in bank robbery slaying. Extra! Extra! As I told you before, you went against my orders. Sticking up a bank truck .. Why, you've gone back ten years. - Yeah. Now what are you going to do about Joe and Abe? You know, I promised them protection. "Belmonte" protection. - That's your lookout. Let them fly together with that Fitzpatrick Cop. Say .. wait a minute. All three are tried together, eh? Yeah, a joint trial. The D.A. put that through. Well if we get off Abe and Joe, we get off Fitzpatrick too, that's right? Oh .. I begin to see. What a break for me, what a break! The Chief of Police thinks he can stick his nose into my affairs .. does he? Listen .. you go prepare your stuff, see. We'll get him off. Fighting Fitz tries to set up his own brother and Sam Belmonte gets him off. I guess that will show them who is the boss of this town. You say the truck passed within three feet of you as it went by the corner? Yes sir. - Quite fast, I suppose? Recklessly? - Yes, sir. Just how fast? Like sixty, sir. - Sixty miles an hour? Pretty near that, sir. Going sixty miles an hour, within three feet of you? Yet you say you got a good enough look at the occupants .. To identify them as those two defendants? - Well. You see .. I mean .. You're not quite positive now, are you? I guess .. I'm a little .. confused. Yes .. that is all .. Just a moment. In answer to my question a few minutes ago .. You told the court the truck wasn't going thirty miles an hour in your estimation. I guess .. I did. And you stated you positively recognized the defendants .. Abe and Joe Gorman as the occupants? Well, I .. What made you change your mind? Answer the question. What made you change your mind? Why, just seeing them again makes .. me think I'm wrong. In my office before this trial started, you told me that you were positive .. I object! I object to a District Attorney telling the witness what he said in his office. Objection sustained. That's all. Evelyn Green, please. Take the stand. From the time you were hit on the head, Mr Fitzpatrick .. How many days later was it, before your mind became actually clear again? About .. four days. What conversation took place in your brother's office the day of your arrest? It's all a blank .. I don't remember even being there. You have no recollection of your alleged confession? Not a thing. You cannot recall the manner in which this alleged confession was procured? No. I object to this questioning and move to have the answer struck from the record. Granted. Strike it out. This constant intimation by counsel .. That the defendants were forced into confession by beating is outrageous. My client should know. The court heard six witnesses testify that the defendants admit their guilt .. Only after normal and necessary examinations! Yes! Six policemen, and all pals of the Chief of Police! This is a court of law. The court declares a five-minute recess. Now ladies and gentlemen, just look at that fine young man. A boyish face for his years. And with all the honesty and openness of a boy. Can any of us imagine him wanting to steal? Can we imagine anyone making him do a dishonest thing? And consider these two other defendants. You've seen them, ladies and gentlemen, all throughout this disgraceful trial. Strong men smiling .. in the face of false accusations. One of them, it is said, has a prison sentence behind him. Had I that prison sentence behind me, I would boast of it! Why? Why? Because he went to jail to save the honor of a .. woman. Wouldn't any of us do that? I, as his attorney, am entrusted with his story. Could I but tell it to you .. Ladies and gentlemen .. You would arise in your seats and cheer him! And can you look at those defendants .. And imagine them killing anybody? Can you honestly point to any man, and say that man would kill, willingly? And what is the only testimony introduced by the prosecution .. Which is worth any consideration at all? The word of three detectives. Who, although they claim to have been present at the scene of the crime .. Had only lightning glimpses of the actual culprits. And who are these three detectives? Intimate friends of our esteemed Chief of Police. "Fighting Fitz". "Fighting Jim Fitzpatrick." The strong arm .. The blundering failure! The man who has been so baffled in cleaning up this, our fair city. Who has been so outwitted by the real crime element. That he's imbued his whole department with one idea. Obtain convictions at any price. Make an example of someone. Anybody! He's that willing to stab through the innocent heart of his own brother! He's all ready to send his own brother .. to the electric chair! That is my plea, ladies and gentlemen. I beg of you .. That you bring in a verdict .. Which will ensure your peace of mind .. In the days to come. Quiet! Ladies and gentlemen of the Jury, have you arrived at a verdict? We have, your honor. We the jury, find the defendants .. not guilty. Order in the court! I can far from compliment you on your verdict. In my fifteen years on the bench. This is the worst blow I've ever seen dealt to justice. Please don't think I don't understand your .. Uncertainty in making this decision. And .. deplore the conditions which caused it. But .. As I couldn't help but intimate in my charge to you this morning. You had an opportunity of laying the foundation of a new .. public courage. Now I see .. your hearts are made of water. Defendants discharged. Hey Mike .. did my brother go? You don't think he'd wait and see you, do you? Snap out of it, Ed. We're throwing a party for you boys. Come on, cheer up. Come on fellows. Nothing to worry about. Come on. I feel so lucky to get out of there. Is that you, Tom? Who's there? Hi. I used my old key, Jim. Put it on the table and get out. Listen Jim, I've got to talk to you .. I've got to. Go quietly, Mary's asleep. - Oh, don't Jim. I couldn't stay away, no matter what you think of me. And that lawyer Michaels pounding it into you in front of everybody. All on account of me. Hitting you below the belt. Jim, I looked over and saw your face. Jim, you got to listen to me. I wanted to get up and tear his jaw off, honest. I wanted to get up and yell the story but I .. I .. I didn't have the nerve. I didn't have it, Jim. If a guy hasn't the strength to go straight, he turns yellow inside. I can't stand to think what I've done to you, Jim .. honest, I can't. Never mind what you've done to me. Think what you've done for Belmonte. Coming out on top, like he did tonight, was all he needed. You sold the whole town into his greasy hands. I know .. he thinks he's got it. His mob is down at Gelli's celebrating now. It came to me there, Jim. I couldn't stay, I sneaked out. And came crawling up here. Don't you see, Jim? It would help me get my guts back if you would only talk to me. I tell you what I'll do. I'll go to the newspapers. I'll tell them everything I know, about the trial. Everything. I'll bust Belmonte and his mugs wide open. I'll have them if it's the last thing .. - Nah .. It's gone beyond all that. Legal red-tape, newspapers pulling strings. I've got to do something! Sure, you can do something. They're all down there .. Celebrating, eh? Have you got enough spine to go down to Gelli's and .. Tell Belmonte you're going to spill him? Yes. What good will that do? They'll have my body laid in a empty lot in the morning. No they won't. You be outside that joint in half an hour. Exactly 3:30 by that clock over the Terminal Building. Right on the nose at 3:30, you walk in there and call Belmonte's hand. I'll be right behind you. What's on your mind, Jim? Well, he might get a little rattled, mightn't he? With you ready to spill the works, and a few of us boys walking in on top of it. I don't know what he'd do. - Maybe he wouldn't know himself. Maybe he might come along like he's done before and .. Then again, he might not. - You mean? They'd start something? - That's it. Oh, I can't do that, Jim. Not just because I've .. There's no reason for you to risk .. - I've got a job to do! And I'm going to do it. Are you in? - Am I? Better wait until later. Winston 4361. Yes, hello. Hello? Hello Tom. - Oh .. hello, Fitz. You don't have to ask me that, Fitz. With you and me, that's twelve. You think that's enough? I know fifty more who would like to be in on it. Oh no, fewer the better. Only what's necessary. Will you call them? Yes Fitz .. I'll .. I'll call them. In fifteen minutes. You know what this means, boys? Most of you got families. You've got one too .. haven't you Fitz? You are great guys. Let's go. Quiet everybody. Say, will you mugs shut up for a minute. I want to introduce our guest-of-honor. Mr Fitzpatrick, the distinguished streetcar conductor. Streetcar conductor? I thought he was a doorman at the Ritz. He went to jail to save the honor .. of .. a .. woman! Tell me .. I want to see that Mr Fitzpatrick. Sure. Oh, that's not my Fitzpatrick. Where is my Fitzpatrick? My own Fitzpatrick .. Paging mister Ed Fitzpatrick .. ha! I'll find him. Hello there, Ed. How are you? - Hello Ed. Aha .. there you are. My friends .. Detective Fitzpatrick. I haven't told you how happy I am that you are at liberty again .. have I? And listen .. you big tub of grease. I've never told you what I think of you, have I? I haven't told you I'll walk out of her and spill your racket to the newspapers. I haven't told you I'm through with your whole, dirty, murdering business. Well .. The guest-of-honor. Come in. Belmonte, this is going to be private .. just you and your boys. The rest of you .. get out! Well, Belmonte, you've just heard a mouthful, haven't you. You feel as though you want to come along this time? You think a lawyer or a Habeas Corpus will help you after he tells his story? Come on over here, Ed. No, he won't. I know just what you've got up your sleeve, Fitzpatrick. But don't do it, see. You come one step closer and I'll blow him in half. Come on in and get them, Jim. Thanks Ed, I will.
