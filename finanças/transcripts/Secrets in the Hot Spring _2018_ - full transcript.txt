Ask Gin to come home. All right. Why did you take my eyeball off? Why didn't you hold tight to your parents? Weren't you scared? You know why I'm in this silly outfit and work part-time here? Hold on tight to your parents' waist, arms, and thighs. Heart throbbing. Lub-dub lub-dub. Beating super loud. 'III enjoy seeing you people get so scared that you hug each other tight. But you... You didn't do that, did you? Uncle, I'm sorry. Uncle? Call me "bro"! Mom. That uncle is so scary. Didn't I tell you? Call me "bro"! You are fired. That brat got lost and pulled my eyeball off. I'll dock the cost of the eyeball from your wages. You won't call my school, will you? Please don't call my uncle. If you really have to tell him, at least wait till my auntie is not there. Okay? “Uncle” How can you answer the phone in the class? Uncle? You called me in the first place! I'm calling you as a test. What kind of student would take a call in the class? I'm not in the class. Not in the class? Who are you speaking to? No one. It's a cold call. I don't need anything to build a six-pack. I'm hanging up. Hello? Speak up. All men need a six-pack. But since you're a woman, forget about it. Goodbye! Jackass! We've been teachers for years. I've never seen a jackass like you. Still in high school at the age of 20. You should get a medal for that! How are your grandparents doing? I haven't seen them for ages. Shameless jackass! Don't pull the phone away! That's enough. Forget it. The jackass uncle of yours says that this school has many idiots dumber than you. Maybe there's one next to you now. All you need to do is get in less fights... It costs a lot to call. What are you doing? Give it back, I haven't finished yet. Please graduate from this school. Bye bye "Qie Xiao Gin" This student... His name is Qie Xiao Gin Qie is... quite an unusual surname. Qie. Stress last syllable Right then... Can you please tell me... On your first day in a new school, why didn't you show up till the 5th class? No? It's fine then. Mr. Gin, take the seat next to Little Princess. Which is the last seat in the second row. Get up. -That's the fourth row. On your right sits Little Princess. That's your left. Every student in the school knows cellphones must be switched off during the class. That's basic etiquette. For Mr. Gin here, this would be... the third high school he's been to. Everyone should appreciate the time you spend with Gin because it may not be long. You have one new message. Answering your phone is the basic etiquette. Your grandpa's health is getting worse. Come home and take over the family business. Grandpa wants to speak with you. Here. Xiao... High school... Hey Blondie. Keep your nose out of our business. Got it? Did you get it? Grandpa said... - Hey Blondie! Are you deaf? It's okay if you don't finish high school... - You hear me, Blondie? You've learned more than others... It's enough. -Blondie... Shut up! Blondie, Blondie! So annoying! Damn Blondie! Are you standing up for him? You better watch out! Gin, thank you. You stink. They forced me to drink from the toilet. You three fought against one, eh? Transfer student Blondie and school bully Bat... are fighting over a sissy boy out of jealousy. I always knew about Little Princess. Look at him! Don't you want to throw up? But Lu Qun is in 10th grade! I know about Lu Qun... - What an old face for a 10th grader! He's that gloomy looking thing. Anyway, later... Blondie finally got his way. -Gin finally won. He rescued the faggot. - Rescued the Princess from the Bat. And won over his heart. Listen carefully. Put the word out. I want to teach Blondie, Xu Lihan, and Lu Qun alesson! Aye. Stop! Get back here! Come here! How dare you stop! You are next! "Damn Faggot" "You are next" Mr. Gin, is there something on your mind? Not particularly. Then why when I ask you to make a bookcase, you have built a house... With such exquisite craftsmanship that I even want to buy it from you! "Damn Faggot" I don't discriminate people. As a teacher, I hope my students don't spend too much time on dating. In the blink of an eye, winter vacation is around the corner. In another blink of an eye, the school will start again. And soon you will graduate and take the university entrance exams. And then get expelled. In another blink of an eye, you will have kids. I want to die... You'll know in the evening that I've died. It's too high. It's all your fault and you pretend nothing happened. You can tell them to come after me. I did. I even begged them to beat you up. They said they are no rival to you. They enjoy hitting me instead. Oh. Did you hear what I said? Are you picking up the phone? If not, just hang up. They said when the winter vacation begins, they'll beat me up on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and Xu Lihan on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. You should be responsible! Message from the teachers' office for Qie Xiao Gin in Class 3, 12th grade. We got an emergency call from your family. They ask you to check your cellphone. Mr. Gin. Please... Tell your family that school is different from a department store. The teachers don't act as your secretaries. We don't relay messages like that either. Mr. Yao? Is it okay to speak with me on the phone? It's okay. Your auntie's gone to a pawnshop. A pawnshop? What for? She's pawning the wedding ring to see how much our marriage is worth. Oh. -Don't worry. It's just a divorce... Uncle, are you crying? Of course not. If you describe your uncle's life in one word, it'd be "bravery". 2374 NT dollars! I'm hanging up. The train is about to leave. Can you please get off? It's his fault. So now we're on the run. I've found a part-time job. And now? He's an heir to a hot spring hotel. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth... What spoon in the mouth? You should not speak with things in your mouth. I'm so nervous. We're about to meet your parents. Hey. What does your family's hot spring hotel look like? My parents died ages ago. My grandparents are managing the place. I'm warning you. Don't say anything good about the hotel. Of course we won't... What? No matter how luxurious or beautiful or comfy it is. But that's quite rude. It's not how we should behave. Does it matter? He just wants to use phony praises to cover the fact that we are freeloaders. I want to make myself dislike that place. "A hotel that ignites passion in your relationship" Is it for real? Never heard of this place. Maybe it's like "Lanruo Temple". What's "Lanruo Temple"? Journey of life is like a beautiful dream Wind blows on my face Several roads lead me to... Blondie. You gave this place too much credit. Hey. What does "O0 Hotel" mean? Probably means "circles". A pair of slippers for 5O dollars. Two pairs for 200. You think we are stupid? And that bathroom scale... We were charged as soon as we stood on it. And it's not even working. So much froth and scum float on the water. How can we have a bath? And... The hotel looks nothing like the pictures on your website. I can sue you for that, you know? It's a fraud! Anyway, it's such a dirty place! - Idiot! Get down! We want a refund! It's hallucination again. We're sorry. We're sorry. Are you all right? Are you all right? I'm okay. I'm sorry. So sorry. Forget it. We're just being too kind. Let's go! Go... My gosh! Even the door is broken. This is ridiculous! Thank you. -People are so evil nowadays. Exactly! Whoever made the web page is so mean. See you again soon. - They took advantage of you elderly! Listen, you'll get sued sooner or later. Sorry. Seriously... Wish you a prosperous business. And have children soon. Xiao Gin! Your eyes have not changed at all. Grandma. My name is Xu Lihan. I'm Gin's friend. It's so good to have you back. So good to have you back. Oh my! Why are your teeth bucked? Old man. I'm Lu Qun. Blondie and I had some disagreement. They did it on purpose. I can understand. Look at yourself. Who wants to admit you're their lovely grandson? Hey! Didn't Suzuki come back with you? Who is that? Who is that? Look at your grandson. He's studied in high school for 5 years. His memory is worst than ours. So, what is "Suzuki" ? How would I know? "Classroom 3-3" "Gin loves Little Princess" Are you okay? You go to this school? Excuse us... We didn't mean it. Or what do you want? Xu Lihan? Little Princess is Xu Lihan? A girl called Lihan... On the surface, Xu Lihan is a boy. But we don't know if he's really a boy. A boy? "The key is made of cypress. A fine of 500 dollars will be charge if lost." Grandpa Gin. My surname is Qie. You wrote it just now, right? Internet. Insert a coin. Insert a coin. Insert a coin. Insert a coin. "A phone that saves you the trouble of writing letters" You can insert a coin. But you cannot ride it. Are you sleeping Brother John Morning bells are ringing Morning bells are ringing Ding, dang, dong Everyone, gather around. Gather around. This is the first inn the Qie family built. Now we call it a hotel. WOW! So grand! No, so ugly! It was burned down. This is the remain of the site. We Qie family have been in the hotel business for generations. We're successful and famous. This was the hotel my father was running when I was a child. Then when the war broke out, the hotel was gone. Later I came to Taiwan. I worked in the martial arts club run by Grandma's family. Then conveniently, I married your grandma and Gin's father was born. I had no money or courage to run another hotel. Come. Next stop. Hello? Hello? I swear... If he doesn't say anything first, I'll never speak to him. Because I found out that... Gin and the school bully Bat... Who are you calling for? Hello? -In the lavatory... Booking rooms? -with that Princess... Hello? He won his heart... But this time, there's no way I can turn into a man. Who was it? A Quest? No. The voice sounds like a woman. But in the end, she said she was a man. No guest then... Let's try this. The hot spring is good for your health. Don't forget to try it out. Do we have to pay? Pay? If you offer to pay, I'll be offended. But since you guys are sensible, I'll charge a small amount of cleaning fee to avoid dispute. Since you're Gin's friends, let's not talk about money, eh? After midnight, I'll turn most of the lights off to save money. I mean save energy. Why do you look like a foreigner? Let me tell you in advance. Should you see any froth and scum in the hot spring, they're certainly not froth and scum but medicinal herbs. Gin. What? You want to pillow-fight with him? "Forget the troublesome urban life" "No TV in the hotel" "Bathrobe 3700 dollars, if removed, 3700 dollars will be charged" "No Haggle and No Refund" Profiteers. Dear guests, welcome to our amazing hotel! How many days would you like to stay? Oh, three days? Then... Let me show you the hot spring. Okay, let's go. Please turn your heads 360 degrees to the back. The froth and scum you see on the surface are definitely not froth and scum but medicinal herbs. If you drink the water, one sip costs sixty thousand dollars. Come, let's turn our heads to the other side... What are you doing? I'm checking if I can steal any money. What do you want? Come join us in the hot spring. No. What happened to the chair in your room? Can you leave me alone so I can steal money? Go away! Blondie seems so strange. He's not only violent but talks to himself. I thought they'd put Blondie in the Presidential Suite. But his room is the same as mine. Who knows if this hot spring is real or not? How can a hot spring be fake? Of course it can. Froth and scum. No. They are medicinal herbs. Gin... Gin... Gin... Gin... What's your problem? Didn't you hear that? The horrifying sound... I heard someone calling my name. That was me. I mean the other three strange sounds. In the beginning it was... Then it sounds like... The third... -Can you let go of me? You two perverts, let go of me! I assure you... The third sound was definitely not human. Let's go and check, okay? Can you free me off this thing? No, I can't. Why not? They say you'd kill a sleepwalker if you wake him up. We should guide him slowly back to bed. Can we go now? It must be him talking in his sleep! What? Pretty smart, aren't we? Only two of us running the place. It saves us a lot of work like this. But... Don't you think it looks like... Like what? I mean, Grandma... You could hire helpers. Hire? It costs! Go. Collect the sheets. They need washing. Okay. "Gift from Suzuki Gas Shop" Bigger smiles on your faces! Happy smiles! Splash! Splash harder! Buckteeth, splash the non-Buckteeth! What are they doing? Harder! That looks so sick. How is that sick? These photos are to be posted on the website. We thought about this idea for a long time. But we can't find good-looking youngsters. Are they good-looking? Stop fooling around! Be more serious! Non-Buckteeth, get out of the water. You go back in! Why can he get out of the water? Why don't you ask me? You don't smile right. We're running a decent business. Call for an ambulance! I'll get tetanus. You'll be fine after a suck. Don't even think about it. In the old house, we might have a first-aid kit. Old house... Where is it? I may not live to go that far. "The Qie Family" Before the hotel was built, my whole family lived here. "Private Property. No Trespassing" Excuse me. Holy crap! Even if we find the kit, I don't dare to use it. I've found it. What's that sound? Just a gecko. How long does it take? 1O seconds. Hold on a second. 1O seconds have passed. Okay, it's done. Is it? Again, come over here. Take another one. Hi. I'm a guest. I'm also a guest. I'm the owner, Xiao Gin. Dear guests, welcome to our amazing hotel. How long will you stay with us? Let me think... How about staying for our whole life? Our whole life! It's so beautiful! Is this our room? It turns out to be a fraud! You looking for trouble? If you are done, let's go! That doll house... What doll house? The one that you played with in the film... What? It's not a doll house. It's a hotel management game. It was a model. It looks great! Where did you get it? We made it ourselves. We used it to simulate running the hotel. How nice! You are a boy. And your parents played House with you. My parents wouldn't do that. You weren't listening to me. What's the rush? Exactly. I want to see more of this place and get to know you better. Get out! I can't get in the water. I'll get infected. No. Didn't you say you'd get infected? I thought the place was a ruin, it wouldn't affect its business if I died there. But police proved that there was no such an event. Maybe you'd inhaled carbon monoxide and weren't completely conscious? I've told you. There was no fire. The charcoal wasn't lit yet. Next, we obtained an exclusive picture of the hotel owner who the victim claimed to have committed suicide before him. Sorry to intrude. Hey! Hey! What happened to me? You rushed into my room in excitement. You hit and broke a chair before passing out. What was that about? I saw a ghost. Thanks. I asked you not to say anything good. Just do your best. No need to compete with Lu Qun. I told the truth! At first, I thought it was Lu Qun. But that "thing"... It had long hair, one hand and it was floating! You stayed in the hot water for too long. I didn't. I did put on my glasses. With glasses on... Wouldn't it turn foggy? I told you not to be suspicious. Hey, yours. I don't want it anymore. Can I sleep in your room tonight? Go away! Don't even think about it. I saw only the feet. I saw the hands. Wait till you see its face before coming back to me. It was real. Then why didn't I see anything? Why didn't my grandparents see anything? Only you two saw it. It's your first time here. Of course. The Gin family owns the hotel. If words get out, will you still be in business? Gin... Would it have anything to do with your parents? If it were really them, they should have come to me first. Why would they go to two strangers? It's hard to say. When we first arrived, your grandparents mistook us for you. Maybe. They think we look more like that adorable child in their memories. If you think this place is haunted, you can pack up and leave. Hello? It's me, sis. Where are you, bro? Never mind that. Have you been feeding A-Huang? Is A-Huang around? Yes. He's wagging his tail right here. Bro, tell me where you are! What's wrong? A-Huang is my grandmother. Bro? Bro? Bro... Hello? Hello? Lulu... Bat, my brother is on the phone. Yo. You seem quite well these days. At first I thought you pretended to be sick. Grandpa. Yes? That model... Did we throw it away? Which one? The hotel management game. The model. The doll house for playing House... We still have it. Where are you hurting? I've applied medicine to it. Why did you slap me? What's so funny? Why are you still here? Sure enough, bustling days are short. You've got legs of your own. If you wish to leave, no one can keep you. Same with you, Gin. And his dad and mom too. Take Grandpa for example, when he's ready to leave, I cannot keep him. Don't you dare leave! Where are you going again? If you want to leave, then leave. If you are staying, then don't knock on my door at night. Even if you have something important to say, say it, but with some distance from me. Don't scream out loud like "Ghost"! And then come hugging me. So disgusting! In this case, can we sleep in the same room? Keep your distance! So annoying! When you're afraid, open your eyes and look at me Take a good look at me Despite the pain, don't let go of my hands Hold them tightly In darkness, I'm with you My eyes light up your surroundings The moment our eyes meet, sparkles are seen Come closer, can the distance come closer? Grab the invisible red line firmly In darkness, our shoulders nestle at last Lightly, Make a choice between me and the Bat. Can the heart beat more lightly? Let go of my sister! But it's fine if you hear it As long as you're with me I'm a scared-cat, but I am different, I am changed in your company Even my impassive heart turns tender and begins to beat Unknown terrors lie abundant behind the door But I won't run away again when I get scared Even if I'm trailing behind, I am no longer alone. Thank you for keeping me company Idiots! Lu Qun? Xu Lihan? I was... I was surrounded by people like this before. I beat them so hard that they were hospitalized. Even... Even though this thing isn't human, I can still easily... I'm standing up too fast... Don't... Ghost! Did you see its face? No. Only hands and feet. Are you okay? -No. You're disturbing us. I mean... Did you see that... Gin. At our age, to be honest, it's hard to have anything. At this hour, we could only lie down and sleep. If we are lucky, we wake up the next day. It's very late. You three are still up. Didn't you work hard enough during the day? Or you're showing off being young? What do you mean they're already dead? Would the dead appear in daylight? Do they look dead to you? Haven't you seen that movie? Which one? There are at least five. Ask skillfully. Okay. Grandma. Can you tell me skillfully if someone had died in our hotel? In every hotel, more or less someone has died. What? But not in ours just yet. Don't you know what "skillfully" mean? Move aside. Grandma Gin, have you had breakfast? I'm tidying this up first. I have some snacks here. Why don't you have some? Smells nice, right? You have them first! Eat up! Xu Lihan! What the heck are you doing? You got your hands even on Grandpa too. I didn't! He did! So, Grandma is also a mortal? Yeah. Damn it! Oh, sorry that they are still alive. As soon as I came back, I sensed something strange. Why is the hotel doing so badly? No wonder... because it's haunted! Don't say it out loud! Yeah, don't. Say what out loud? That word. If you keep saying that word, they'll hear you. They'll come near to hear what you're saying. Who's they? Oh! Ghosts? See? It's all your fault! Hand in hand... What does that mean? Eating instant noodles in secret? I'll cook you some dumplings. You seem to know a lot about them. Quite a lot. Is there any way to get rid of them? Yes. With What? Something both you and me have. We've got a lot. How about him? He doesn't have any. I know what it is. We must act now. Let's go. Hurry UP! "Bucket for feet-dipping." The thing that you both have but I don't... You mean low IQ? It's masculinity. No. It's the air of confidence. It's just like fighting and claiming territory. Whoever shows confidence wins the game. Go away. You're reducing our masculinity and confidence. Go away. It seems that we really don't understand the boy. Who could expect that Gin actually enjoys folk dance? We've demonstrated enough power. Yeah. Is there anything I can help with? Yes. There's something only you have and we don't. Fill it up, thank you. With What? Virgin's urine. I don't have that. That was a nice fall. Very good. I don't think it will work. Stay awake and we'll see. You fell asleep. Watch out! I didn't fall asleep. Shh! Over there. Go! Let them play with a few strings and milk cartons. So they won't play with our phone. It's true! I already got so many prank calls. This time is the worst. Left... Left side. Left side? No... No... To my left. To my left. Behind you. It's gone to the other side. On the other side! Behind you. Turn faster! It's late. It's late. We're going to sleep. Nothing else? Swear at them. Curse them. They're afraid of being cursed. Why not? What's wrong with having a check-up in the hospital? You look like a lady bug and it's not working. No need. Our hot spring is therapeutic to both body and soul. Moreover, lbefievein only your grandma. Then go on a vacation. We did. Where? Here. Last month, your grandfather and I stayed in the room where Buckteeth is staying. We spent a few nights there. Anyway, can you go away for a while? Absolutely not. Now it's the peak season. We expect tons of guests to come at any time. You want the hotel to go out of business? Gin. This place is yours sooner or later. You need to remember. Running a hotel is a responsibility. You can't just close it and leave. We need to be responsible for our guests. Be responsible for your parents. Why do I must take over? Why do I must be responsible? I have to be responsible for the hotel. For Lu Qun and Little Princess who are bullied. Why I should be responsible for so many things? How about Bat? I will be responsible. Don't we take the front door? You want to check out? Our ID cards! Oh yeah. Go have a look. Why me? I told you he's long dead! Grandpa! Grandpa! Here. Grandpa! Come here. Grandpa! Grandpa! Give me your hand. Stop kicking! Go! The old lady isn't human either! No! It wasn't cleaned for a few days. So it gets dirty. That's why I said... Running a hotel is a responsibility. But you are floating on the water... Aliyah. Didn't Master Gin tell you just now? He was having water therapy. But your illness... The water therapy has cured his illness! I saw you with luggage. Where are you off to? Off to? You're joking! I was going to stop Blondie from leaving so I blocked his way. Take what happened just now for example. I couldn't hold my grip of Blondie. So I accidently hit Grandma. Have you seen any ghost around here? No. Are you sure they're not dead? If they aren't dead, they won't sue me, right? How should I know? There is hardly any guest here. It's Men's Bath. Where did the long hair come from? How would I know? You two... aren't smart either. Gin. You've studied in high school for 5 years and you aren't smart at all. All these hair... They aren't mine. We haven't changed the water for six years. Things must be jammed in it. You think we don't want to change the water? We're old. We're managing the place O“ OUT OW“. It's exhausting. When I'm exhausted, I often think that... It was a good thing that your parents built this place. As long as the hotel stands, I feel like they are still around. These hallways, rooms, kflchen, and by the windows, I could often see them. We really hope that they come back and visit us often. That's enough. Even if they don't come back to us, one day, we will go see them, won't we? Yes. Although you dress like this every day, I'm still not used to it. Grandma, the make-up you put on today... I'm not used to that either. For Grandpa's health! Can I... -I called you several times. Why did you ignore my calls? My cellphone has no signals. I called your room. You made those calls? I heard no voices. Gin. Can you hear me? Can you please let me hear your voice? "Gin's House" I promised Grandma that if you don't say anything to me first, I won't start the conversation. Luckily you spoke to me first just now. Do you need help with those? No need. Okay. We have other things to do. Hey! Master Blondie. Introduce us to each other! You seem to know each other well. She was a senior when we were in primary school. Her name is ki... Hsu Suzuki. They are my classmates. Lu Qun. Xu Lihan. I often hear Grandma mention a beautiful "Suzuki". So it's you! When did I ever say that? Yes, you did. Damn Buckteeth. You're Xu Lihan. I am. How do you do? How many years are you senior to Gin? None of your business! Out of the way. So sassy. I like it. Get down here, idiot! I'm Lu Qun. Nice to meet you. Kayaks and Sadako... I must capture you! Were you crying earlier? No way! Cry? Why didn't you signal me to look? Our Blondie sheds a tear! Having the "thing" around isn't necessarily a bad thing! Go to hell. If possible, I still wish my grandparents a long life. Gin. So I don't have to take over the hotel. That's right! What? Take a look. Is this the ghost or that? Ignore how childish his drawing is. Let's count the number first. That "thing"... There are at least two. I wasn't like that. Fire suddenly goes out... Don't add your imagination to it! What's really odd is that my grandparents have never seen it. They sleep in the same room? How can that be allowed? They are all guys. Why not? Exactly because they are all guys, so... Grandma, you don't understand! I do. What do you understand? I understand everything. How about Grandpa? Don't ever let him understand! Choose one. Let's investigate. No way, bro. We didn't get a wink of sleep last night. We've been cleaning the pond since dawn. I feel you're scarier than Bat and the "thing". I want to choose. But I really can't lift my arm. Useless... Hey. Blondie. Give me Suzuki's number. Suit yourself. She's 3 years older than me. So she's 5 or 6 years older than you. Older is good. I like bigger. Low-life! It's okay. Mock me all you like. I still want bigger. Fortunately, this time... We stopped them leaving in a reasonable and natural way. But when he wants to leave next time, I don't think we can stop him. I think we should wait no more. Don't break this again. It's troublesome to sew it back. You call this investigating the pond? Don't push your luck! Hydrotherapy takes time. Why don't you go back to the room? I don't want to be alone. It's cold. Get into the water if you're cold. Don't tell me you can't swim! Why don't you get into the water? It's got nothing to do with swimming! My mom died in a hot spring. Not here! When my parents went on a learning expediction in Japan, my dad died of heart attack. He didn't even have time to name our hotel. So my grandpa just drew two circles on the sign. How old were you then? Second semester in third grade. Nine years old. What are you doing here? This is a Men's Bath. So you do know you're men. I paid for it. I worked hard so I need to relax. You can go to Women's Bath to relax. Gin was about to enter fourth grade. The hotel was in the middle of the construction. When my mother-in-law... which would be Gin's mother took him back to her family. I graduated in that year. I never received a bouquet from you. Didn't even have time to say my goodbyes. Why are you looking at me when you speak? How about your mom? My teacher and I were called out of the classroom in the middle of an English class. They said my mom drank and drowned in a hot spring. She was in a bad mood so she drank a lot. She drank to her death like that. Before your mom passed away, didn't she tell you anything? If it weren't for that ghost hotel... your father wouldn't have died. These words... She kept saying that since my dad died. When she was discovered, a photo was floating next to her. What photo? This hotel on its first day of construction. You all know about Bat, right? Bat has been bullying me for ages. After Gin stood up for me, it's gotten even worse. Who stood up for you? Exactly. Shameless! Batandl went to the same elementary and high schools. We went home together every day and became good friends. Bat became a bully in 8th grade and always tried to cut off ties with me. What does this have anything to do with my mom? This hotel is your family's dream, isn't it? I don't care how Bat keeps trying to beat me up or writes things on my back or throws my book bag into the gutter, I still want to be friends with Bat. I also know that... Deep down, Bat also wants to be friends with me. At most, you'd be killed by Bat. But I have to be burdened with my late parents'... what you just called a "dream". What if I ruin it in my hands? The point is... ls running this hotel also your dream? Dream, dream... It's not that simple. You aren't just writing it on paper! If your parents see the way you are now, they'd be disappointed. Who do you think you are? Holy crap! Aren't you scared? He's a thug! Gin actually has a kind heart. He won't do anything to me. That old man is getting stingier. Why do you like Bat so much? Maybe I just prefer someone that looks bad. What's that smell? Go! Hey! Do we have to check room by room? I'm really scared. I'm scared too. Don't worry. I know a safer way. It's even scarier. What are you scared of? Let's gm! Did you take it? What are you doing? The hotel is haunted. We're taking Grandpa and Grandma away. Haunted? What a joke! It's true! Move over! Why didn't she believe me? I need something soft as padding. Blondie. Have they done something unacceptable? For example, missing and wishing your parents to come back. How could it be possible? Grandpa! Grandma! Play House when you can come back alive. They've probably ran away. We should flee too. It shouldn't be us who run away. This hotel belongs to the Qie family. In this field, I'm regarded as a first-rate master. Remember, candle light can protect you. Never let the light go out. These are my candles. Shut up. Lavender for you. Rose for me. Orange Blossom for Lu Qun. Cinnamon for Suzuki. What? It's not why I brought the candles with me! Shush. Let's go. You don't need to. Oh, okay. Not you. Her. Me? Why? When we leave the room, you put the door back and block it. Let's go. Just because I'm a girl? I never thought that you are. But none of us knows how to ride a clutch motorbike. If something happens to us, you need to go to the police. Let's go. Stop pushing. Hey. Can you two say something? Like what? If you're scared, then sing a song. Life is a long road... Hey. What now? Can you come to the restroom with me? What's wrong with you two? Go by yourself. Shut the window. What? What's up? Look clearly! Get up! Get up! Stand up. Doesn't it look like someone just checked in? Don't say that. I'm scared. But we've got the candles to protect us, right? These are made of essential oil! Oh yeah. I almost forgot the scent of lavender soothes nervousness. MY ass! The scent of lavender isn't the point. The point is keep the flame burning. Give me yours. Gin. What's this? A-Huang gave me this. Thank you. But a dog tag is likely to be useless. A-Huang is his grandmother. You really need to pee right now? I'm only thinking. I haven't peed yet. What should we do? Did I ever tell you where my dad died? Wasn't it in Japan? On a snowy ground. My dad died on a snowy ground. My mom died in the water. Didn't you suspect that my grandparents might have done something unacceptable? As long as the hotel exists, they exist. What are you doing? When I first returned, my grandparents mistook them as me. I knew they did that on purpose. They were angry at me because I refused to come back. Mom. Dad. Don't go too far. They're my friends. Mr. Qie. Mrs. Qie. Stop scaring them. If they are scared to death, I really don't have any friends. I know you are mad at me. Mad at the way I am now. At the fact that I abandoned this place. But it's nothing like the doll house. Or playing House. You are no longer around. One day Grandpa and Grandma will be gone too. I can't even finish high school in 5 years. I'm afraid. "Hotel Management: Theory and Practice" Gin. Xu Lihan was right. This place was not only your dream but also mine. But you were selfish. Dad was selfish. So was Mom. You left just like that. Left me in the care of uncle and auntie. Then Grandpa and Grandma. I'm not sure what they did to bring you back. But they still have many years to live. Can you let them go? They are so mean and stingy. They'll definitely find ways to keep the hotel going. Please leave. But this time, take me, the troublemaker, with you. Then I'll forgive you. You can't do that! Come help me! So annoying. Let's gm! I'll protect you. Mr. Qie. Mrs. Qie. Mr. Qie. Mrs. Qie. Don't listen to his nonsense. If he doesn't return to school, he'll be expelled. Gin. Gin. Your family get the wrong person again. Mom. I'm here. Mom. This is not my mother! Run! Who still has a light? I found it. Hold your breath. Gin. Give me that crane. What? -Quick! Okay. Take it. When I count to three, you grab him and squat down. Get it? One. Boss, say it clearly before counting! Two! Three! No! Don't! Please don't! Qie Gao! Grandpa? Gin? Qie Gao! Move aside. Qie Gao! What happened to you? Qie Gao! How are you feeling? Grandpa, where are you hurting? My heart. What? I'll never agree to it. Agree to what? I'll never let him marry into our family. Little minx! I'm not! Yes, you are! We're doomed. He's lost his mind. Do you still want it? Or I'll drink it. Say something! Inlove? He and I ? Suzuki warned Grandma a couple of times. We didn't believe her until we saw it with our own eyes. I'll protect you Told you that's not true! Grandpa, it's not true... My first love is... -That doesn't matter! Why do you disguise as ghosts to scare people? I worked so hard all for the future of the hotel. I don't get it. Gin. Have you forgotten? You and your parents came up with this idea. Me? Yes. When? On August 14th 2002. Four o'clock on Saturday afternoon. What? I asked you to come back because I want to discuss it with you. Who knew you'd bring two idiots back? What are you saying? Two handsome boys back. So we tested on these guinea pigs - What's so funny? Why are you so late? I couldn't find the scissors. Useless... How can we make money with this ghost thing? We thought the same at first. Then your grandma saw it on the news. She said... There's a haunted hotel abroad. Many people rush to stay in it. The more ghosts haunting the house, the higher they charge for the rooms. Is that why the hotel looks so rundown? No. We don't have money for renovation. But didn't Mom and Dad go to Japan? They went to learn more about ghost houses. What? If it weren't for that "ghost" hotel, your father wouldn't have died. I remember when I first came to Taiwan, I was really young and had nothing Ideals? Dreams? I had neither. As long as I had a meal, I was satisfied. But I kept thinking about my life in the hotel in my hometown when I was little. To a child, living in a hotel can be a lot of fun. I told your dad about this. Later he had this idea of running a hotel. Back then I was against it. I told him it was too risky. But your dad said. If we never tried, we'd never know. If we try hard, something good is bound to happen. Did anything good happen? Just like Grandma said. No matter who leaves first, as long as the hotel exists, it feels like everyone's still around. SuzukL What are you doing here? Didn't Grandma ask you to stay in the hotel? What on earth happened? As far as I know, Grandpa finds out that Blondie and Little Princess are in love, he couldn't handle the news so he attacked Little Princess. Little Princess then said. That's my first love! Grandpa said, "Okay." Something good happens if you take the risk. "A hotel that ignites passion in your relationship" Admission to "Ghost House" "August 14th, 2002. 4PM" Hello. Excuse me Is anyone there? Do you also stay at this hotel? Yes. But I've been waiting for so long. No one seem to be around. Then let's go somewhere else. Yeah. Wait a minute. I'm back. I'm sorry for keeping you waiting. Whose innocent eyes have made you let go of it with such courage? Who has left such scars that made you grow up overnight and understand My darling, you don't need to make up for anything Love lasts either as forever as or a journey You're the one I'm proudest of and love most profoundly And a family that I'll never be apart Luckily we've grown up We have enough memories Let go and bravely march forwards Thank you for the hospitality. I had a very good time. Me too. Thank you for the hospitality. You're welcome. Thank you for coming. This really is... a wonderful and amazing hotel. You must come back again! And a family that I'll never be apart Luckily we've grown up We have enough memories Let go and bravely march forwards Happiness is about to begin We went to a haunted house in an amusement park. I actually didn't think it was scary. Props were badly made. The ghosts were silly. But my parents didn't know I wasn't scared. They held me super tight. Three of us squeezed together, heart throbbing, lub-dub lub-dub, beating super loud. It was my mom's screaming that made me jump. My arms were hurting from the squeeze. To me, I enjoy seeing people get scared and hug each other tight. I can't memorize things well so I can't even finish high school. But that ten minutes in that Ghost House... I've always remembered it. Dad and Mom must have remembered it too. Yeah. Maybe... It's really like what it says on the book. A hotel that ignites passion in your relationship. Hey. Won't you agree? If I hadn't changed, I can't imagine myself talking to a nagging gay and a hooligan while bathing in a hot spring. Who's gay? You like Bat so much. Who else then? That's right. But Bat is a girl. "Lanruo Temple" Journey of life is like a beautiful dream Wind blows on my face "The Qies Hotel" I'm bound to die here. Yes. You're bound to die here. Who invited me here? I did. Who's paying for me? I am. Free? Let's go then. Come on in. Come on in. Excuse me, sir. We're fully booked these few days. Do you have a reservation? Yes, I do. I'm not lying... What are Buckteeth and that self-righteous Princess doing? They are not helping the guests. Here, this way please. Go to hell. They're taking a big step towards their dreams. Gin. -Where's that jackass? 'III Be polite. Uncle. Auntie. Damn brat. I didn't know you can smile. Don't you need to call me? I thought you vanished into thin air! Hey. It cost me more to buy back from the pawnshop. What are you whispering? Don't worry. It's a hotel that ignites passion in your relationship. Where are your grandparents? That's right. Where are they? Rule No. 1. Hold your hands tight with the person next to you. Rule No. 2. Be alert to your surroundings. Since you've become part of the Qie family and swore on your lives, you have to keep the secrets of the Qie family. So... There is a good reason that we bought the land cheap. We were forced to turn it into a haunted house theme hotel. Gin. When I'm done here, let's go to a movie. It is... indeed... a fake... hot... Spfing!
