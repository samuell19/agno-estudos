[Chattering] Well, have a good time! Goodnight! Oh, Miss Heath, I can't make heads or tails of these accounts the Porter Street branch. Hilda Engstrom in charge there isn't she? Looks like I'll have to fire her. Oh please don't do that sir. You couldn't find a better girl than Hilda for that store. Well you'll have to admit she does send us a lot of cleaning items Yes I know - men's suits and neckties There's no harm in it really. I can get right down there tonight and straighten things up in no time. Tell her to forget men and keep her mind on the job. You'd better take a key for the Porter Street store with you All right mr. Todd Hilda where's that account for it - - oh never mind I found it. Hurry up Hilda, I'm practically through. - Okay Connie, I'm talkling to Terry Mason. Okay I'll do my best. I'll call you in the morning Okay bye Oh, Connie let the books go all right I can All right, I can finish it later or I can do this in the morning Oh Hilda by the way Mr. Todd's plenty burned up about you're playing around boys so much. You better kind of keep your mind on your work Well, boys are my work There's no future in the cleaning business Well what future is there and flitting around from one man to another? Oh I should stay home and sit around all the time like you do, huh? I don't sit around - I'm just waiting on the right one Yeah when he comes along, you'll probably be tied up for another day Oh, Connie, what about the party tomorrow night? Oh Hilda, I only have that old flowered thing to wear Oh wear that - I can't I can't. It's been fixed too many times, it's falling apart. Why don't you buy yourself a new formal. Can't afford it. - Could ask your dad for some dough Ask Dad for some money to buy a party dress? Don't be silly! I'll tell you what - we'll stop by at your house and take a look at that old gown Maybe your mother can let it out or something All right but I have my doubts. Oh mom what do you think? How do you like it? Wait a minute let's look It's no use - this old thing collapsed months ago [Hilda] Does look pretty tacky I can make it look real nice honey. - Oh Mom, we've made it over so many times I don't don't know - kind of looks like a granduation dress or something You know how nice Hilda always looks. Well that's because I spend every cent I make on my back I don't have to pay board like you do. Well, what's the use of working and living at home if you're not gonna help? Listen honey I got $30 put away Now there's an idea - you could buy a swell dress for 30 bucks. No now wait a minute Mom you've been saving that for your winter coat - we're not gonna touch it. But Connie - No Mom And anyway you know how Dad would nags us to pieces if he ever found out about it. The trouble with you girls is you don't know how to handle your men. You should come over to my house and take a few lessons. [Laughing] I got a picture of my old man trying to give my ma the works - [Hilda] - because she loaned me some money for a dress -ha ha! Why, she'd knock his ears down! [Laughing] Hey who's up there? [Mrs. Heath] Yes, Roger Who's up there? - Just a friend of Connie's, Dad. I asked you who it is. - Hilda Engstrom Connie had to help her with the books tonight. - yeah that's what they told you. What time did Connie get home? - About an hour ago. Tell her I want to see her. [Mom] Connie! Yes, Mom! - [Mom] Dad wants to see you! Alright! - If I had no man like that I'd crown him. Wait for me - I'll be right back. Yes Dad? Connie I told you once I don't want you running about with that Engstrom girl. We had to work tonight. That'll do to tell your mother but it won't go down with me. I want to know where you two girls have been. [Connie] At the Porter Street store. [Scoffs] Well if you don't believe me, you can call Mr. Todd in the morning and ask him. [Mr. Heath] Maybe I will I'm sure he'd be glad to know you have no faith in your daughter [Mr. Heath] What's faith got to do with it? I don't like the company you pick! You say that about every boy and girl I every went with! Dad the child's got to have a few friends her own age. [Connie] There's nothing wrong with Hilda. Don't tell me about that one! The brainless hussy firting with every man she meets. First thing you know, you wil turn out the same as she! She just stopped in to help me fix an evening dress for a party tomorrow night. What party? - We're just going dancing, that's all. [Mr. Heath] Well you can't go! No with that wench! And don't ever let me catch you with her again. Now get her out of here! Hilda you heard what Dad said? - I didn't miss a word! I'm sorry Hilda don't pay attention to him. - In one ear and out the other, the old crab. What I can't understand is why do you let him get away with that stuff? What can I do about it? He never believes anything I tell him. Well then don't tell him! Make him think he's a great guy and and that you wouldn't cross him for anything in the world. Then cross him. You're not gonna let this mean Ralph stop you from goining tomorrow night? [Connie] You heard what he said. Well just for that I'd go anyway. But I haven't anything to wear. [Hilda] Well I'll get you a dress you'll get You'll get me one? - Yes, well I'll loan you one. I've got you that you've never seen, I've only worn it once. Okay, I'll call you at lunch. - Swell. You could put it on in my house. It's a royal blue chiffon wth a built-in slip so all you need are some slippers, okay? - Okay. Night! [Music] Are you having a good time, Connie? - Oh, wonderful! I've seen that girl around town for over a year now and never realized how pretty she is - Pretty good figure - Not the only cute figure on the floor. Oh maybe it's a dress she has on. - Yeah, maybe it is. [Music] He said they might drop in later - Oh! Excuse me! - It's alright. - Sorry old man. - Neil? - What is it? - That girl! - Very attractive. - I'm trying to tell you that's my dress she wearing. I wore it the last time you took me out. You spilled some wine on it, and I sent it to the cleaners, remember? I'm going to ask her - - Gloria wait a minute. You'll feel like an awful fool if you're wrong. Why don't you wait until morning and take it up with the cleaners? Whatever you do, don't create a scene here. Come on, let's dance. Well here's where we say goodnight. We had a swell time, fellas. Yes, it was grand. Thanks a lot. - Wait a miniute, Connie, I'm taking you home. Oh no, Connie's getting out here. - But this is where you live. - That's right, but Connie's staying at my house tonight. That's just dandy. You don't have to go in right away, do you? - I'm afraid we do. - How do you like that? - Gee, Connie I'm sorry! Oh, you should be! Why don't you look what you doing? Well he didn't mean to do it, Hilda. - Well, he ruined it! I'll buy another one. - With what? Well, good night. What's she sore about? It's Connie's dress. You can never figure dames. Hilda, I'll take her to dressmakers the first thing in the morning. I'll leave it right here. If you had any sense, you would have picked it up when you got out the cab. I wasn't my fault you know, it was an accident. I'm sure it can be fixed. Yeah that's what you think. Let me see that dress please. [Scoffs] Look Neil just as I suspected It's not only been worn but it's been torn and repaired. [Neil] That's right - Well I'm sorry It must have been done in the cleaning. I'll report it to Mr. Todd at the main office. [Gloria] I'll report it myself. - Where is the main office? - 1243 Wabash Avenue. May I do this for you? Come on, Neil! Miss Engstrom, I can't understand the dress being in this condition. There's no way you can explain the damage? Well no Mr. Todd. I-I can't imagine how it happened. Alright, I'll investigate. You're positive the young lady that waited on you isn't the one you saw wearing the dress? - We're quite sure, Mr. Todd. - Come with me, please. Step this way and I'll have Miss Heath take care of this. There's the girl who wore my dress. - [Neil] It does look like her. Are you sure? Why you must be mistaken. No, I'm positive. Miss Health, night before last you took the key to the Porter Street branch, didn't you? - Yes, Mr. Todd. -You take it again last night? - No sir. - It's not on the rack. Oh, I forgot, I have it right here. This is Miss Adams, one of our customers. She left this dress at the Porter Street branch to be cleaned. And you can imagine how delighted I was to see ou dancing in it at the Hula House last night. Are you sure it's the same dress? You know it is. It's an original from Bryson's. Let me compliment you on your taste. But I give you my word I didn't know it was your's. You didn't care who it belonged to - All you wanted was to steal it for one evening. - How long has this been going on? - Mr. Todd, I don't understand. - Didn't Miss Engstrom offer any explanation? - Said she know nothing about it. - After all you were the one who wore it. - Mr. Todd's company's covered by insurance. Fully covered. The loss will be made good at once. What about this girl? - She will be discharged. No doubt the insurance company will prosecute. Come on, Gloria, you'll get the money for your gown - what more do you want? Mr. Todd, isn't there anything that can be done? - [Mr. Todd] I'm very sorry Miss Heath. - Remember me? - Yes, what do you want? I'm one of the attorneys representing the insurance company that carries the risk for Avery-Todd. My name is Neil Dillon. I'm interested in this case. As a friend of Miss Adams? - No I'm here on my own. You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to. Oh I'll talk to you - I'm not afraid, not much. Well as I get this - you wanted to go to a party and knock some poor guy for a loop with a swell gown so you helped yourself to Gloria's dress. All of which goes to prove that crime doesn't pay. I'm not a criminal, and I didn't take the dress! - But we both saw you're wearing it. - That doesn't make any difference I didn't take it. - Then how'd you get it? - It was loaned to me by another girl. She told me it was her's. - Why didn't you try that story on Todd? Well if I told Mr. Todd it would just be her word against mine and we'd both be arrested. So you want to take the rap yourself? - What rap? Well, they call it larceny and it carries a pretty stiff sentence. You mean -? Oh, but I thought it was just a question of making good the loss! Golly, Mr. Dillon, what are we gonna do? Well, I can't defend you and prosecute you at the same time. Well, can't you tell him that I didn't know the dress was stolen? Oh please, Mr. Dillon, you've got to help me! Well, we'll see. Who was this other girl? Hilda Engstrom- she works at the Porter Street store. Bob, that dress was loaned to Connie Heath by the girl in charge of the brach from which it was stolen. You know, the Engstrom girl is the one we should have arrested. - Have you done anything about it? - Yes, I've sworn out a warrent for the Engstrom girl. Why did you want to handle this case, Neil? Well, Miss Adams is a friend of mine. She made thing pretty tough for that Heath girl. I just thought it was up to me to do something about it. Well Miss Heath is responsible for the loss, and Im afraid she's left to settle for it. - Well let me take care that, will you. - Okay. what we want right now is the cost of the claim. By all means press the the charge against the Engstrom girl. Right, I'll see you later. Are you Hilda Engstrom? Why, no sir, but I'll call her. Hilda? Just a minute - I'll get her. I guess she must have stepped out for a minute but she'll be right back. Okay, I'll wait. I thought I heard somebody in the house. What are you doing home this time of day? Uh, I got a sick headache so I had them send over a relief clerk. There's something queer going on here. I can tell by the way you act. Ma, what do you think - Connie Heath's been arrested. - Arrested?! For doing what? For breaking into the Porter Street branch and taking one the customer's dresses to wear last night. You were with her - didn't you recognize it? Well... I-I thought I did but I can't remember all of them. Besides Connie said it was one she just bought. But the worse part of is she tore the whole back out of it. That's the way I found it in the store this morning. - Wait til Mr. Heath hears about this! - Oh please, Ma, don't tell him. - Connie'll get into trouble if you do. - Well, that's her lookout. Besides I've got a bone to pick with that big windbag. Coming over here and tell him! - Where are you going? - Over to Heaths'. - But it's suppertime. - Supper can wait. Connie Heath's been arrested. - What for? - For stealing a dress. - But I don't ... - Oh, you never see anything! Have you forgotten the fuss mr. Heath made about Connie going out with our Hilda? Well, I haven't. We'll see what he's got to say for himself now. - Oh, Connie! - It's all right, Mom. Oh Mom, this is Mr. Dillon. He's the attorney for the insurance company. He got the judge to let me go. - Bless you for that, Mr. Dillon. Connie is a good girl. She didn't mean to do any harm. - I'm sure she didn't. - You don't have to tell her dad, do you? He wouldn't understand. - I'm afraid he'll have know, Mom. - You see my company has to pay the claim. Kate, where are you, Kate? That's Mr. Heath - he's just home for work. Please don't tell him, Mr. Dillon, please? Kate, why don't you answer me? - I was just going to, Dad. [Kate] We got company. It's Mr. Dillon, a lawyer. [Neil] How do you do, Mr. Heath? A lawyer? What does he want with us? He came to tell us about our Connie. She's lost her job at Avery-Todd's. Why? - Why, uh, they're laying off a lot of people, Dad. And Mr. Dillon's maybe going to give her a job as a secretary in is office. Aren't you, Mr. Dillon? Why yes I think your daughter would make a very good secretary. She knows shorthand and typewriting and everything. You never regret it. Well, a job's a job these days. You talk it over with him, Connie. Come on, Kate, I want my supper. [Whispering] Mr. Dillon what - - Oh don't worry, I'll work it out. I'll never forget what you've done for us, today. - Kate come on! - Coming Dad. Here's my office address. I'll settle with the insurance company and you pay me when you can. - Well, thanks ever so much - That's alright. You just be careful. I got your name on a police blotter now. One more bad break and you'll have a record. Good luck [Knocking on door] Oh so you're back, are you? - Excuse me. Well thanks ever so much Mr. Dillon. Goodbye. Where's that high and mighty father of your's? - He's having his supper, Mrs. Engstrom. Hilda told me all about you. If she hasn't got nerve enough to tell that old blabbermouth where he gets off, I have. Mrs. Engstrom dad doesn't know anything about this. - What's going on out there? - I don't know, Dad. Some friend of Connie's I guess. But Mrs. Engstrom please! Well Mr. Heath if you can stop feeding your face for a minute, I'd like a word with you. - Mrs. Engstrom - Yes, it's me alright and don't you can stop me till I've had my say! So, you thought my Hilda was giving your daughter a bad name, well now it's my turn to tell you to keep you daugher away from mine. Any man who gives himself the airs you do oughta know a likke more about his own family before he goes around insulting other people's. At least my Hilda's never been arrested for stealin'. They had her down in the police court this morning for stealing a dress from the people she works for. I was arrested alright, Dad, but Hilda took the dress. - She's lying! I wore the dress to a party last night and it was spoiled by an accident. I told them what had happened and the judge let me off. I just have to pay for the dress that's all. That's blaming it all on Hilda. Shame on you! You've had your say, now get out. Oh I'm going all right but just you bear in mind I won't have my girl run around with no jailbird. That's why that lawyer came to my house and you two lying about it. So it wasn't you who did the stealing, eh? I suppose you've got a special name for wearing in other people's property. - Dad Hilda made me believe it was her dress. - Don't try to lie out of it! - I'm not lying! - I told you not to go with that girl. I'll teach you not to steal! - Dad! - Shut up Kate I know what I'm doing. - Connie, I want you to take this - Oh no please Mom, I don't need it. Yes you do now you take it. Well if I ever get my debts paid, I'll send it back to you. - Don't worry, Mom. - I wouldn't worry if you would't go so far. I have to go out and get a job. Ardmore's not so very far. 500 miles. Better hurry- it's a long way to that bus station. Alrighty, we're leaving. Be careful of the friend you make honey. Sometimes it's a girl's friends get her into trouble. I'll be careful, Mom. - Goodbye, Connie. - Goodbye, Mother. Why Hilda, I didn't know you were in Ardmore. If you had I suppose you'd turn me just as you did once before. - Buy a magazine, Lady? - I tried to protect you, but you lied about me and left me to to take the blame. Look, Hilda, I want you to sign a statement that will clear my name back home. If you think I would you're crazy. You'll sqawk to save your own skin, and I had to leave town with the coppers one job behind me. I'll fix you for that if it's the last think I do. - But Hilda- - Get out of this car! - You don't know what you're doing! - No I won't get out til you- [Gunshots, People screaming] [Man] Hold up! Stick up! Bank reporting- the Union Bank's been held up. Be on the lookout for a dark green, make and license unknown. It's a man and two girls in this car heavily armed last seen going north on Highway 19. Apprehended arrest and hold for central robbery detail. [Sirens] - No Hilda, don't! - Get away from me! Stop this car! Stop it or I'll shoot you! - Get it from her Hilda! - How can I? You better stop. She just scared enough to let one of us have it. [Police] Alright, stick 'em up! Come on! - You're the dame that done the shooting. - [Hilda] Sure, she's the one. That's not true! I took the gun away from her and made them stop the car! How do you like that Tony? Looks like the girlfriend's turning state's evidence. - Yeah [Police] Into the front seat Which one of you girls is behind the 8-ball for this man? I don't know anything about him. I never saw him before today I didn't even know he was inside the bank. Just went along for the ride, huh? Okay, take him down. You're smart you'll keep your mouth shut. Don't tell them a thing. You ever been arrested before? Go on squawk -tell them all about yourself so everybody will know the jam you're in. Oh you're not as tough as you are. You're both pretty young to be in a racket like this. - What's your name? - Mae Abbott. - Where do you live? - 23 Landy Street. Got that Sergeant? You'll probably us a vacant lot. Your parents living? No I'm an orphan. How about you sister? You look as though you might have a family someplace. Come on, you might as wel tell me, they'll see your name in the papers anyway. No, I have no family, my people are dead. All right. What's your name? - Ann Morrissey. - Address? - Same as mine. You travel in bad company sister, but if you'll tell me what you know we might make it easy for you. I've already told I don't know anything about it. Okay. Take 'em down and book 'em. [Connie] He gave her the gun and when the police chased us, she started to fire at them. Then I finally got the gun away from her and made them stop the car. Your witness, Mr. Strong. So that's why you had the gun in your hand when you were arrested? - Yes. - The gun with which you would fire - the pursuing officers? I object. Mr. Strong answering his own questions. Look at this girl - does she look like the sort who fires guns at policemen? Why the very thought is ridiculous. Mr. Craven, you save all that for your summing up. Continue your examination, Mr. Strong. You heard Miss Abbott testified that your talk with her in front of the bank was staged to divert suspicion from the getaway car. Yes but that wasn't true. You say you've talked about some trouble you girls had? - Yes sir. - What trouble? - I can't tell you that. - You mean you're afraid to tell me afraid to tell me for fear it might uncover other criminal activities you girls were engaged in? I object and ask the question be stricken from the record. Strike that out. - What was the trouble with you? - I can't tell you because it would involve others. I ask the court to direct this defendent to answer the question just put. What was the nature of the trouble you say you had with this girl? [Judge] You must answer the question. You don't dare tell the truth about yourself! Did anyone see or hear Miss Abbott order you away from the car? - I don't know. - And after he got into the car- did anyone see her order you to get out? - I don't know, there were a lot of people passing but I wasn't looking at them. And when Mr. Rand came rushing out of the bank with a gun in his hand, weren't you startled? - [Connie] Of course! - And why didn't you scream and appeal for help? I didn't know what to do! [Sobbing] The minute those shots were heard everyone knew that a robbery was taking place inside that bank. Yet you asked us to believe that you sat there, too dumbfounded to act and calmly permitted them to carry you off! What else could I do with a gun held against- A gun against your back! A final dramatic touch to the most amazing tissue of lies I've ever heard in the courtroom. - [Mr Craven] Objection! - [Judge] Sustained. That's all. [Judge] Defendents will rise and face the jury. [Jury Foreman] We, the jury, find the defendants Anthony Rand and May Abbott guilty of robbery in the first degree as charged in the indictment. [Jury Foreman] The defendant Anne Morrissey guilty of robbery in the second degree. [Judge] Clerk will record the verdict. [Judge] I remand these defendants to the county jail to be held until the 30th where they will be brought before this court to receive sentence. Your Honor I move that the court grant permission to file an application for probation for the defendant Anne Morrissey. I object to that motion, your Honor. On what grounds would you ask for probation Mr. Craven? I believe that the defendant is holding back the truth in order to shield others. And that to sentence this girl now without further investigation would be a miscarriage of justice. Very well, you may file your application. But I warn you that unless the probation department gives her a a clean slate, she will have to serve the sentence provided by law. Why did you ask for probation? I don't want it. Do you want to go to prison for a long term? I don't care what happens to me. I don't want any investigation. What are you trying to hide, Miss Morrisey? What difference does it make? Why don't you let them send me away, let me drop out of sight and get it over with? No matter what you do I won't tell any more about myself and I already have! All right, but I'm going through with it just the same. I'm going to see that you get a break whether you want it or not. Here's a job for you, Jane. 2nd degree robbery conviction waiting sentence Anne Morrissey. She's a new one on me, Chief She was convicted as an accessory in the Union Bank robbery. Personally I don't believe a word of her story so if you have any doubt whatever turn the application down. All right I'll go to the county jail and investigate. Oh, hiya Marge! Hey Ruth, Marge is back! You old stick in the mud, you're not a sight for soar eyes! How are ya, kid? Gee, it's swell to back in the old finishing school. I knew you couldn't stay away. What happened to the old matron? - She married a deputy sheriff. I suppose they're gonna raise deviants. Say, Mrs. Campbell can I have Marge back in my cell with me? You've got Kitty in with you. - That dame, she was vaccinated with a phonograph needle she never runs down. I'm so sick of listening to true confessions. Why can't you bunk with one of the new dames? Say who do you think's running this jail, you or the front office? - The front office. - and they're not doing so hot I hear the place is full of thieves - [Matron] Get in there. Hey, you got company in the parlor. Huh, wait til you've had a couple of years of this in the state prison - you'll crack wide open. You'd squawked long before this if you hadn't been afraid of your folks finding out. I'm not afraid of mom finding out. - No, but you old man. - He'd make her life miserable. - He'll never get the chance. - How you gonna keep it from him? You don't dare write your mother from state prison because then they'll find out your real name. Besides there's me to consider. - Oh Hilda you wouldn't do that! Oh wouldn't I? Hey it's my turn to clean up my cell today and I don't feel like it. Take your pail and get to work, come on. Hey girls, get a load of this! I've hired myself a maid to do my housework. In here! Do the washbasin first. I washed my hair in there this morning Think of all the hood I'm gonna have in the big house with a stooge to do my chores for me. How do you break it in a way with a stump like this? Oh it's just mind over matter. This gal used to have it all over me in our hometown. All she had to do was crook her little finger and my boyfriends broke their necks to wait on her. Now she's breaking her heart waiting me. And do I love it. - Where was your hometown? - That's our secret isn't it, Anne? Anne Morrissey- what a swell alias you picked for yourself. Shall I tell the girls the girls what your real name is and who your mother and father are and how tickled they'll be what I write and tell them how you made good? You'll never tell anything on me! [Matron] Who started the fight? - She did! She's been picking on this kid driving her crazy! Okay I started it - and I'll finishing it! - Oh, no you won't! These girls were fighting in tank 3. - Well, what's it all about? This one admits she started it. - Got anything to say for yourselves? - I haven't not now. I'm sorry. There's a deputy probation officer waiting to see you and this isn't going to help you any. Have Emmy take her to the attorneys room Mrs. Campbell, then give both these girls 24 hours in solitary to think it over. That's all. Come on. This is Miss Lennox from the Probation Department. You're getting a better break than you deserve. Not that I think it'll do you any good after what happened today. - What's the matter, Emmy? - Miss Lennox, if you've been around here as long as I have you find out it's true the female is deadlier than the male. Mind your manners while you're in here or we'll double your time in solitary. You don't look very deadly to me. I'm not it's only that - Oh, what's the use. I don't want to talk about it. Suit yourself. Is Anne Morrisey your real name? - Yes. - How old are you? - 22 - Where were you born? - New York. - Know the address - Grammer Street, I dont remember the number. We'll check that with the records of the State Department of Health at Albany. You see, your name, the date of your birth, and where you were born is always filed with the doctor's birth certificate. If we find you've been lying, we can do nothing for you. I'm not asking you to do anything for me! First of all, you must understand that I don't come from the District Attorney's office, nor do I represent the police. I'm here to help you. It's no use. Well you didn't do much to help yourself. You wouldn't let them call character witness, you wouldn't tell them anything about yourself. You said you were innocent, but one would think you actually wanted to go to prison. Do you? No! No girl wants that! A woman's prison is a tough place for a girl like you. It'll break you down and leave a stain you can never wash out. How do you suppose your mother- My mother's dead! Is she? Well there must be someone who loves you. Perhaps the man somewhere... There's no one. Now, that's hard to believe. A young girl like you, only 22 and no one who cares for her? Why I'm much older than you with only half your looks but there's a man who says he loves me. And if I got into trouble anyone can you know, he'd be the first one I'd go to. And if I wasn't sure of him, I'd turned to the one I knew I can trust. [Sobbing] There, there. What is your real name my dear? - Connie Heath. - Where does your family live? - In Irvingdale. But they mustn't know about this. Mom believes in me, but well Dad doesn't. And this only convince him that he was right. That I've been bad all along. Promise you won't tell him. One of the unwritten rules of our department is that both parents must be notified. - But perhaps we can get word to your mother.. - Oh you can! She'll help us keep it from him. She's always stood between Dad and me. She'll help you find out anything you want to know. [Mrs. Lennox] Were you ever arrested before? - Yes once, but the charge was never pressed. Now I want you to tell me everything that happened to you up to the time of your arrest at Ardmore. There's your boudoir, hop in. Anne Morrisey'll love this. Don't worry about Morrisey - she'll be taking stint just as soon as she's through with the probation officer. She won't get probation if I can help it. Hey, phone the DA's office and tell them I've got another statement to make. Do it yourself darling you'll find an ivory phone right at the head of your bed. I can only recommend probation. It's the judge who grants it, and I'll have to convince him. - You'll be sure to get in touch with Mother? - Of course. Now you may not see me again again until the day you brought up a sentence. - All finished? - Yes, Emmy. Well I don't know what she told you but I'll bet she didn't fool you much. Not much. Goodbye, my dear. I'll do my best. - Goodbye Miss Lennox. So it's "my dear" now is it? You certainly must have made a good impression. Come on my dear, I've got to lock you up. - Come here, son. - Buy a magazine lady? Only got one left. - No I never read magazines - Then you can look at the pictures. If I sell this one, I can go home. Haven't I seen you around here before? Sure I work this corner every afternoon and Saturdays. I'll bet you weren't here the Saturday morning the bank was robbed. I bet I was! - Well come along with me - Hey, wait a minute, I ain't got nothing to do with it! No, but you will have. You're going to get a reward. County Courthouse. You're sure you're not making any of this up now, son? No sir, I seen it all. See, this girl was sitting in the car, and this girl came along and started talking to her. They were both sore about something. The girl in the car told the other girl to beat away from there or she'd get in trouble. But she kept on arguing and got in with her. What did the girl in the car do then? Well she got sore an' ever and tried to push the other girl out. I moved in because I thought there was gonna be a scrap. [Miss Lennox] And you heard every word they said? Sure, I thought they'd start scratching any minute. Just then there was shots in the bank, the guy came out with a gun and when he seen the other girl in the car, he started cussing. But when she tried to jump out, he wouldn't let her. Well, Judge, what's your opinion? Miss Lennox, I'll let you when I've studied your full report. Wanna buy a magazine Judge? Only got one left. [Judge laughs] It is the opinion of the court that the findings of the probation officer have established a cause for reasonable doubt as to the guilt of this defendant but that it is not so conclusive as to warrant a dismissal of the serious charges brought against her. A study of the reports submitted by the Probation Department convinces me that her trouble began with the choice of bad companions and the practice of deception in her own home. Young woman, it would have been better for you to openly defy your father rather than to evade the issue with deception. You've seen how lies will build one upon the other until the entire structure falls about you in disaster. It is the judgment of the court that you shall be imprisoned in the women's division of the State Penitentiary for a term and period of from one to five years. But I suspend that sentence and place you probation for three years. So, you're on your way out? Yes Hilda, I'm going home. Tony and I are going to the Pen. The judge gave Tony 10 to 15, and I got 1 to 5 Oh Hilda I'm sorry. Yeah you must be heartbroken. What did you tell this probation woman about me? - Well, the truth that's all - The truth huh? If it hadn't been for what was in your report, I'd gone off with a year in the County Jail. I saw your mother in court this morning but I'll bet your old man wasn't told and the first thing I do is - Miss Engstrom! After you serve a year in prison you'll be eligible for parole but if you do anything to cause any trouble for this girl I can safely promise you that you won't get that parole. Now think that over. Come on, Connie. You must report to me once a month by letter and tell me everything you're doing. Your probation offce in Irvingdale will have a complete file on your case, but that file will be strictly confidential and as long as you keep out of trouble, you'll never hear from them. Remember Connie, probation does not mean that you're unconditionally free. Failure to report or any infraction of the rules you may be sent back here and forced to serve the rest of your term in prison. You can depend on Connie, Miss Lennox. She'll never fail you. I'm sure she won't. You just live up to my belief in you, Connie. That's all the thanks I want. You wait out in the hall for me and I'll ride down the elevator with you. Miss Lewis, will you get me that file on Jane Honor - they picked her up again. - Same old racket? - In the same old way. I always said that girl was no good. Oh nonsense there's a little good in the worst of us. Yeah, and a lot of bad in the best of us. - Thank you. Now Connie, when you get home, why don't you call up that nice attorney you were telling me about, ask him for a job? - You mean Mr. Dillon? - Yes. But if I did go to work for him. wouldn't I have to tell him I was on probation? My dear, the only way to begin with any man is telling the truth then they'll forgive a lot. But if you don't and they find out about it.. [Man] Going down! Stand back! That one goes in there. Hey let's move this desk over against the wall. Excuse me, is Mr. Dillon - ? - Why Connie Heath! - I'll come back later when you're not so busy. Wait a minute I'm not busy. Fine way to treat an old friend- won't even wait to say hello. - Well now that you're a Deputy District Attorney.. - That's nothing. Step into my private office. You know a fella has to wear long pants sometime. Well this is grand - Not bad. - Say I've been worried about you. - You have? Why? Well I haven't heard from you in over a month. When you stopped writing from Ardmore, I thought maybe you were sick or married or something. - [Laughs] No but congratulations. - Why? Well I heard you were gonna be married to Miss Adams. There are wars and rumors of wars but I'm still neutral. I phoned your mother, she said you were alright and I couldn't imagine what had happened I've I hadn't been busy, I'd driven to Ardmore and looked you up. -Really - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - It's nice to see you again. You home for a visit? - No I'm home to stay - Say that's great. The new District Attorney is a pal of mine I rode into office with him. You want a job? - Sure - Are you serious? - Sure - You're hired Oh that's marvelous! Now I can pay you back the money I owe you. But I haven't any references I walked out of my job in Ardmore. You hire me you might regret it. I'll take a chance if you will. How about some lunch? - Wait a minute Now that you're prosecuting attorney it's only right that you know more about me. No more shop talk today, this is a holiday. We're gonna celebrate, let's start with lunch. It's past 10:00, Kate. Connie should be home by now. I told you Roger, she's working at the office. I know you did, but it seems to me she's been doing an awful lot of that lately. - She gets paid overtime. - I should hope she would. - Why didn't she come home to dinner? - She's got a car now. She got a car now, hasn't she? Huh, another woman driver to make life unsafe on the streets. - She's working with Mr. Dillon - Yes that's something else I'd like to know about. Nights when she isn't working with him at the office she's always running around with him. What does that mean? They good friends that's all. I trust Neil Dillon anytime. You would, eh?. I wouldn't trust any lawyer or banker either. Well anyway I think I have a little talk with that Mr. Dillon. - Now Dad don't interfere. Connie knows what she's doing. - That's what you think. Roger, the child's of age, and she pays for her keep. That makes no difference. While she was away from home, she could do as she pleased. But now that she is living under my roof again, she's got to obey me. Connie I've made a few changes in this. I'm afraid you'll have to transcribe it again. I'm sorry. Oh, don't worry about it. We have to get it right, don't we? - You must be tired. - Not terribly. I know I am. You're sweet. - Must you do that? - Do you mean to tell me you didn't expect me to? I know bosses are expected to take advantage of their secretaries when they keep them working at night. But Mr. Dillon, I thought you were different. Miss Heath do you dare deny that for the past six months you subtly encouraged me and led me on? I take exception to that fact. I've been encouraging you and leading you on ever since I came to work here. - But I don't think I was very subtle about it. - That calls for a rebuttal. - Objection! - Objection overruled. Get back to work. - Yes sir. - Well thanks for bringing me home, Neil. - Okay I'll pick you up same time the morning. - Fine. [Roger] Is that you, Connie? - Yes, Dad. Ah-ha! You've got company. Why yes, I brought Connie home in my car. How are you Mr. Heath? [Roger] I'm all right. Come in here, young fellow. - Dad, you don't understand. - I will understand before I'm through. Connie, you'll to leave us alone for a minute. - Oh Dad, for heaven's sake.. - You heard me. - It's alright Connie. - I hope so. Come on Mom. - You've been seeing an awful lot of my daughter lately. - That's right. Has she made any complaint? You what I'm getting at. I want to know what your aim to do about it. Oh. Well as soon as I can afford to build us a home, I aim to marry the girl. Marry her? Do you mean that? Why of course. My intentions are strictly honorable. Well, my goodness! Sit down, young man right here. Have you asked her yet? Why Mr. Heath, I wouldn't think of going to your daughter until I'd spoken to you. Well, it puts a different face on things. I always said you were a man to be trusted. [Neil] Thank you sir. Oh I'm so glad that you're going to become a member of my family. And I think it's awfully nice of you to ask my permission before telling her. If you'd gone to her before you came to me, she would have told her mother and I wouldn't hear of it till it was ready to happen. The way those two women try to keep me in the dark is a joke! [Laughs] Oh, Ma, Connie! It's alright, Ma. He wants to marry our girl. - He does? - Yes, he just told me about. I gave him my consent. It's all fixed. This is no time to interfere. These two want to be alone. Poor Dad, and we've been engaged for six months. I did 18 months when they paroled me. Seemed like 10 years. I know. As soon as you get settled, let me know where you are. Alright. I won't be able to come here again. If the parole board found out about this visit they'd crack down on me. I won't be seeing you for a long time, Tony. - Don't worry, you'll see me all right. - I don't get you. - You think I'm gonna let him keep me buried in here? - Tony don't take a chance. You'll never make it out. Leave that to me. - Time's up. - Okay. Goodbye dear. - You Connie Heath? - Yes, what do you want? Well Mr. Dillon told me to tell you he'll be kept in court all morning. He wanted me to give you this. He said it was for you, so might as well unwrap it. - It looks like dynamite to me. - Thank you very much. - You're very welcome. Hello Mom? Mom, look, Mom I'm so excited I could hardly talk! If I don't tell someone, I'm gonna pop! Mom, look, Neil sent me the most beautiful -! I'll call you back later, Mom. Aren't you gonna give me a big "Hello"? It's your old pal -Hilda. I thought I might surprise you but I didn't figure I'd knock you speechless. I'm sorry Hilda, I had no idea - You had no idea I'd get parole so soon, huh? Hoped maybe I'd do the whole five-year stretch. Well, not at all. What are you doing here? Well, I couldn't get a job in Ardmore, so, huh, so I got permission to come to Irvingdale. Why? Your people don't live here anymore. No but you do. And you're the only close friend I have - except Tony. Tony? I thought you'd forget all about him. Oh, you did, huh? Well I was crazy enough about the guy to help him rob a bank.. - Is your boss in? - No he's in court. - Give me a cigarette. - I don't smoke. - Well maybe your boss does. - Wait a minute, you can't go in there Hilda! - Why not? Because it's Mr. Dillon's private office and you have no business here. Don't tell me you've been working for the guy all this time but haven't got a claim on him? Claim? What do you mean? Oh, you clean vine dame's always get to first base. Swell layout he's got here at the county's expense and pretty soft for little Connie Heath- alias Anne Morrissey. Will you get out of here? Okay I don't want to spoil it for you because that might spoil it for me too. Oh, you'll give me a pencil and a piece of paper I'll leave you my address. - Oh! - Give me that! Wait a minute... Neil? An engagement ring? Well aren't you gonna show it to me? - Well when does the happy event take place? - Will you please go? Okay. 19 Talbot Street, just in case you want to get in touch with me or I'll keep in touch with you. By the way- have you told the boyfriend about being on probation? because if you haven't I think it'd be a swell little surprise for him. So long, Connie! [Neil] Connie! Did you get it? Don't you like it? Oh, it's beautiful. - I haven't any right to keep it. - Hey, don't take that off! Don't you know that's bad luck? What do you mean you have no right to it? Neil, when I first came here, there was something I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen and I guess I didn't insist too much. Now you've got to know. What's the matter- you got another guy? - No. Do you remember the Union Bank robbery in Ardmore? - Yes, why? I was arrested and held as an accessory. You? A bank robber? That's the craziest thing I ever heard! The judge didn't think so. Hilda Engstrom was the other girl. I was carried away in the getaway car. You'll read about in the probation reports. Well Connie why didn't you get in touch with me? I was so terribly shamed, I didn't want anyone to know. I tried to tell you but I got into it deeper and deeper, and I was afraid I'd loose you. Connie, you should know by now that you could come to me with anything. But you wouldn't want anyone to know the girl you're going to marry.. Who's going to know? It's just between us. Hilda knows. She was here just a moment ago. Alright I'll see that Hilda keeps her mouth shut. You had a tough time telling me everything and I wasn't half as bad as you thought. Let's skip it- it's all over now. I hope so. [Sirens] Tony, Tony! - Look, Honey, I brought you some black coffee. - Thanks. I, uh, I have to go out see. - Going out? - Yeah. What do you mean you're going out? Going out for what? Well how long do you think you're safe hiding out here with me? So you're gonna take a powder on me, are you? Oh no, Tony don't go to that window! Well, the only way I can help you is to get money for you, don't you understand? Drink your coffee. Look, I won't be gone longer than an hour so keep the door locked and don't open it until you hear my voice. Alright, dear. If you think you're being followed, don't come back here. I'll be careful, Tony. - [Hilda] Goodbye, honey. - [Tony] Goodbye. [Phone rings] Hello? No, Connie isn't home. This is a friend of Connie's from Ardmore. Oh, she'll be home in a half hour? No, no thanks I'll call later. - [Man] Taxi, miss? - [Hilda] Yeah, 4028 Lindon Street. - Connie? - What do you want? - I see you've been reading about Tony. - It's in all the papers. Listen Connie, I gotta have some money and I have to have it quick, tonight. And you the only one I can come to. - For Tony? - Never mind who it's for. Just get it - that's all you've got to worry about. Do you think I'm gonna give you money to help an escaped convict? What are you talking about? You're on probation yourself. Do you want everybody to know that? Listen Hilda- when you walked into that office the other day I was scared to death. You held a whip over me and I was afraid of what you might do with it. Not to me, but to Neil. But after you left I told him everything. He knows that doesn't make any difference, and I'm not afraid of anything you can do. Well you better be. If it hadn't been for you, Tony and I would be - You both got what you deserved. Tony wouldn't think twice about killing anyone who got in his way. There's only one place for a man like that and I'm gonna send him back there! Oh no you won't. What'll think the DA will do when he finds out that one of his deputies has a convicted bank robber working in his office and is about to marry her? Think that over Dillon means so much to you. But where can I get the money you want? I don't care where you get it. Hey how about this ring? I know a Pawn Shop that says open late. Oh no, you're sticking with me until Tony's safe, and you're not getting within 10 feet of a phone. Come on, we'll go in your car. Remember, I'm taking no chances. I'll be listening to everything you say. Go ahead. I'm closing up, miss. Something you wanted? I have this ring I'd like to pawn. An engagement ring- we have too many now. How much do you want for it? As much as I can get. Well, I can give you $100. Can't you do better than that? Do you want me to go out of business? - Well, make it $200 then. - No, $150 is the best I can do. Here- sign your name and address and your phone number. What'll the boy say that gave you this ring? - You let me worry about that. - He'll do the worrying. - What's this? - That's it my address. I hope you can make it out. I, uh, guess I'm kind of nervous. - Okay, here's $150. That's a lot of cash. - Yes, I know it. Goodnight. Goodnight. I don't know what to make of it, Mr. Dillon. All I can tell you is what she wrote down. She seemed terribly upset, and there was another girl at the door, standing watching. Looks like there's something wrong. Police Headquarters. Now listen Sarge, this is Neil Dillon. Get this- Tony Rand, the man who escaped from State Prison is hiding out at 19 Talbot Street. Broadcast to call the police cars. [Sirens] [Hilda] Come on. - [Connie] Hilda, why -? - [Hilda] Don't stop and talk! Get in there! [Knocking on door] [Hilda] Tony? - [Hilda] Look out, Tony! - [Police] Give it up, Rand! - Connie! What happened? - Oh, Neil, get an ambulance quickly! I'll get one, Mr. Dillon. - Hilda? - They... they got Tony? [Connie] I'm sorry, Hilda. You got nothing to be sorry for. Good luck, you two. [Weakly] Hello Father. I'm on my way to see your boss.
