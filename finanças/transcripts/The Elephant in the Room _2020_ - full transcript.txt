- Oh yes it's gonna be another beautiful day. Fortunately it looks like we've gotten through that tremendous heat wave with cooler temps expected this afternoon into the evening. And overnights are gonna be downright cold with highs expected in the upper 60s until morning. Right now traffic is moving along fairly well although if you're headed south to Manhattan Beach and beyond, you'll wanna give yourself plenty of additional time due to an overturned tractor trailer at the number three and four lanes at the 405 at El Segundo. Cool, right, let's get back to - To the rock and roll retrospective at Chanley Center where 10 of your favorite bands... - Hey, learn to drive, asshole! - Dr. Crawford, please call reception. Dr. Crawford, call reception please. - Thomas, go long. Nice catch, going all state! - Ah, jeez. - Clinic Services, St. Mary's Hospital. - Dr. Chin, Dr. Chin to the fourth floor pediatric unit. Dr. Chin, you're wanted on the fourth floor pediatric unit. - Good morning everyone. First we have two new supportive carefellows joining us. Dr. Josh Little, a pediatrician from UCLA. And Dr. Adam Styfan, an oncologist from Nebraska. Let's start with introductions. I am Dr. David Olson, the chair of the Supportive Care Department. - Good morning, I'm Alex, the Pharmacist for this unit. - And I'm Anna, I'm the neurologist. - I'm Michael. And it is definitely not a good morning. But I'm still a Nurse Practitioner of the group. I was up late. - So my name's Valerie and I'm the social worker for the team. And also the babysitter for this guy. - And for that we are eternally grateful. - Hi, I'm Nicole. I'm the Chaplain for the group and welcome to both of you. - Good morning, I'm Astrid, I'm the Psychiatrist for our team. - Wait a minute. Did you say Little and Styfan? How cool is that? You should be urologists. Get it? Right, okay. - On that note, good morning. It's time to get started. The meeting today will be run by Dr. Astrid Adams. - Thank you. Welcome everyone to a new day. I'd like to begin with a little meditation, taking a moment to clear our heads and recharge. I'd like to invite you to close your eyes. Don't talk. And just let go of work for the next three minutes. Okay. - Mhmm. - All right, we will get started with some general announcements. We still need volunteers to help with the survivor celebration that's coming up. And sadly, last night we lost dear Mrs. Debra Urland. Next on the list is Danny Sorensen, age five. - Danny's cancer is rapidly progressing. And he is experiencing difficulty breathing, severe headaches. I'm worried about a seizure or sudden head bleed that can't be stopped. Sadly I think we only have hours to days left. - Danny came to us originally to be part of a phase one clinical trial. And he wasn't eligible. So it was decided that he would go home in hospice. But his condition, it started to deteriorate pretty quickly. It wasn't safe to transport him home so we've decided to do hospice here at the hospital and let him spend the remainder of his time here under our care with his mother. - April has requested that we make Danny's time as special as possible. So we've decided to throw him a pajama party. - All right. - Nice. - Yeah. - Understandably, April is grieving right now. The best thing that we can do for her as a team is to be there with our presence and our compassion. - And please, always remember. - The door is always open. - Thank you very much. Michael. - Yeah? - Would you take the responsibility of introducing our urol, excuse me, Josh and Adam to meet Danny. - Yes sir. - Thank you, Michael. - Hey, you let me know if you need any help, okay? - Okay. - All right. I gotta run. I have a new consult in the clinic. - Let's meet up. - I'd like to go up to the third floor. There's two patients up there that I wanna see. - Gentlemen. - Alex, maybe you can go over the comfort care medication. - Sure, I can do that. I'm just sorry I'm not important enough for everybody to stay. - Aw, poor Alex. Buddy, you know I love you. But listen, I'm late for clinic. Tell you what, I'll bring makeup marshmallow treats tomorrow just to prove it to you. - You better use real marshmallows. - No, use the whip. Use the cream, use the cream, use the cream. - Dr. David Olson, Dr. David Olson, you're needed in clinic 7B. Dr. David Olson to clinic 7B. - Hi. I'm Michael, the Nurse Practitioner with the Supportive Care Team. - Hi, I'm Kelly Davis. This is my father-in-law Oscar. - Oscar. - Pleased to meet you. - What the hell are you doing? - He's alive! I'm sorry that you're in pain. And you have every right to be angry. - What would you know about it? - You're right. I could never really know what you and your family are going through. But I know that everything in your life has changed. And you're in pain. I wanna help get your pain under control. The problem is, pain can be pretty complex. Controlling pain, it's more than just about giving drugs. It's about me getting to know you and learning what's important to you, what your goals are. And if you can beat me in a wheelchair race. How about we start over. Hi, I'm Michael. Are you gonna shake my hand or should I just wave? - I'm Cooper. And I can already tell you're gonna be a pain in my ass. - Don't worry, I can fix that too. - I'm so sorry this is happening to you and Danny. But you know what? You're showing an amazing amount of courage. - He's being so brave. I just don't want him to see me upset. I'm just not ready to lose him. I don't know what else to do. - You're doing everything you're supposed to be doing as a mother. And now, we're gonna focus on celebrating his life. Let me get things ready for the pajama party. - Cooper's pain is in his lower back and it's pretty severe. He can barely walk and he can't sleep. We are really hoping you can help. - Listen, I wish that I could just make this nightmare go away for all of you. Here's the plan. I get you out of pain, and we race. Deal? - You got a deal. - All those participating in the pajama party for young Danny Sorensen, the party starts as 11 a.m. - I love these pajamas. Monkey ones, huh? My girls would love these. You look so alert today. Does he know what we're planning? - Yeah, he knows. I had to tell him earlier. He was in so much pain. I felt he needed a distraction. - Okay. - Let's show Valerie your new look, okay? - Oh my god, let me see you. Look at you, you cool little dude, give me a high five! Yay! Let me go change, all right? I'll be right back. I've gotta go find Michael too, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Dr. Frederick Martin, Dr. Frederick Martin, you have a visitor at reception. - You guys look so awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Let me go get changed. Okay, I've got the whole floor in pajamas. Everyone should be here in just a sec. - Huh, see? This is what our job is all about. - Danny, Danny, what's wrong? Oh no, someone please! - What's wrong, April? Come over here. Let's let the doctor check him. It's all right. Come on, take a seat. - And he was doing so well today. - It's okay, we've been here. - Should I order a Dilaudid IV push? - No, hold off on that. - Take a breath. I know he was doing well, but remember, - He's declining very fast. He doesn't have much left. - I'm holding on, I'm right here. Right here is comfortable. Right here. - April. Would you like to hold Danny one more time? - You said you wanted to. It's time. Now it's up to you, okay? Take a breath. April. Your sweet little Danny has died. I'm so sorry. - I can't stand the thought of him being carried out on a gurney. Can I please just carry him myself? - Absolutely. I will arrange that. - I know this is tough, guys. Everyone did the best they could. Danny's cancer was just too aggressive. We need to focus on the difference you made for Danny and his mom during his last few days. - Michael, you'd be a little more convincing if you weren't wearing that sleeper. - Ooh. - Don't be ridiculous. I do have clothes on underneath this. - I just didn't say how much. - Thank you. - Thanks Michael, we needed that. - Hey girls, do your homework and listen to your Dad, please. I've gotta go back to the hospital. Shit. - Honey, honey. What's wrong? Oh. Honey, he's not worth it. - Would Gloria Desouza please pick up the courtesy phone. Gloria Desouza please pick up the courtesy phone. - Well hello, Michael. - Hello, Anna, I'm so glad you're here. Listen, I have Cooper Davis on his way in with pain out of control and I was wondering if you could see him on counsel for me please? - You sound really desperate. - Yeah. - Yeah. Sure, I'll take a look at him. - Thank you. - You're welcome. But it's gonna cost you. - Okay. - Mhmm. - All right. There will be a steak dinner in it and a show. Your choice. Oh and some cold beer. - Ooh, yes. - And me, I'll be there. What do you say? - So are the red footie sleepers optional? - Okay, thank you. Obviously she heard about the pajama party. - Obviously, and I think it's really sweet. It's all these nurses can talk about. - Yeah well, I mean enough about my jammy prowess. - I'm on call, so I can take a look at him and I'll update you tomorrow morning. - Perfect. One more thing. You better be careful. This could get serious. - Do you want me to call HR? - Marshmallow treats for all. Help yourselves. - What? - Oh my god. - What's this mess? I thought it was supposed to be homemade. - Okay everyone. It's time to start our pre-meeting meditation. If everyone could sit down and settle in. Research shows that three minutes is the minimum amount of time it takes to reset your minds which allows us to be holistically present for our patients and their families and one another. So, with that, welcome to a new day. I invite you to close your eyes. No talking. Let yourself be free from work and any other stresses. Thank you. - Thank you, Astrid. - Okay. So the next case on our agenda here is... - It's Cooper. Oh, darn, I have to go. Hey, I did not plan this. - Okay, that's fine, great. - If anyone is wounded, Alex. - No Micheal, that's fine. - I have more marshmallow treats in my car and I'm not afraid to use them. - Don't worry about us, Michael. We'll take care of things here as always. - Hey, Adam. You wanna go with me? - Excuse me, guys. - This way, hotshot. Look, I know this program can be rough but I wanna show you how we can really compliment each other. Oh, hey. Psst, Thomas! - Oh, son of a! Jeez, dammit, sorry Michael. This damn thing just won't stay put. - I don't think you should swear while holding Mary. Let's go. We're still broom buddies, for now. This is Dr. Styfan, a urol, oncologist working with me today. - Does that mean I'm so bad I need two of you? - No, actually we're combining forces. - Hey, what's going on? - The pain in my right groin is horrible. I can't stand it! - Hi, this is Michael. I just entered a now order for Dilaudid IV to be given to Cooper Davis in room six. Will you please meet me in here? Would you call Dr. Dracos and fill him in on Cooper? Thanks. We're gonna move over to the bed. Could you hold that. - My god. - There we go. Big hug. There we go, I got you. - That should do. - I just love the effect I have on my patients. - It just breaks my heart to see him go through so much pain. I hate this. - I know. Well listen, Cooper, he's comfortable now, okay? I'm gonna ask the nurse to keep an eye on you two while I go speak with Anna. - Thank you. - Sweet dreams. This is Michael. - Hey Michael, I have the MRI results for Cooper and they are not good. He has multiple compression fractures of his spine and a mass that looks like it has gotten into his spinal cord fluid. Cooper needs surgery right away. We confirm this in surgery, his life expectancy is going to be about three months. In the meantime he could have a stroke, develop seizures and have even more excruciating pain. - Okay, Dr. Dracos needs to know. Could you call him and then meet me in Cooper's room? - I've already got a page in for him and for the neurosurgeon on call. See you in a few minutes. - Change of plans. Hi, Kelly. I'm here with the neurologist, Dr. Crawford and Dr. Styfan who you've already met. We wanted to talk with you about Cooper's MRI. Cooper needs surgery as soon as we can arrange it. His cancer has caused some bones in his spine to break and push down on his spinal cord. And we also think that there's a tumor growing in his spine that needs to be removed. Now these two problems are what's causing Cooper's pain. So Dr. Sun, the neurosurgeon wants to operate as soon as possible to prevent any permanent damage. Okay? - I'm so sorry this has to happen so quickly, Kelly. Here I have, it's just a surgical release and consent form for you so you can sign. Dr. Sun will be doing the surgery. - Cooper, I know you're listening because you stopped snoring. - And she will place and implant a pain pump if necessary or possible, so, - Do you wanna talk about this? - I will do anything to stop the pain from coming back. - That's it. Where do I sign? - Okay. So generally the logistics is just talking about before and how properly it should be taken care of, constantly we need to be monitoring. - I just realized something. I was just thinking how much you remind me of my father right now. - What the hell? - Now hear me out. With a bald head and the blotchy skin. Yeah. You look just like my old man. I mean I know you're not old enough yet. But wow, you could be twins. - Are you for real? - Could you just say, "shut the hell up, you dumb shit!" for me? Come on, say it. Come on, come on. Say it. - Shut the hell up, you dumb shit! Oh god, oh! - Brings back so many memories. - Great. - Why are you being so rude? - Oh he told me so. - He's out on an IV. All right, room 220, got it. I'll go take a look at him. Thanks, Doctor. - My cardiologist told me I just had another heart attack. He doesn't wanna do any more procedures because my heart is too weak so I guess this is it. - I'm so sorry that you're going through this, Mr. Brownrigg. - Thank you. You guys can call me Thomas. We bonded. The three of us, we survived the near disaster with my Mary statue. - How long have you been working here at St. Mary's? - Oh I've been in housekeeping doing floorwork for about two years. I do it just to feel useful. See, after my wife died, I didn't want to just wait around for my turn. We were married for 35 years. - So do you have a designated will, do you got someone to take care of you if you can't? I'm sorry, Thomas. What Dr. Styfan means is do you have any family in the area that can be here for you? - Oh, I have a good friend. His name is Louis. He lives in town here. I don't really have anyone I'm close to except for that Mary statue. I guess I didn't let anyone get too close, you know? I mean my work filled the gaps. Coworkers, the wonderful staff here. And the recent... - Thomas, I'm sorry. I need to go check on something. Dr. Styfan will continue with a few more questions if you're up for it. - Thomas, I wanna make sure that you understand what is happening to your heart. - I'm dying. My heart has had enough. - Unfortunately you are right. Thomas, your heart is very tired. And this latest attack has got your heart working even harder. And we don't know how long it will continue beating. Now if it stops, we can get it started again. You know, with electrical shocks, pushing on your chest, and or medicine. But it won't change the fact how sick your heart is. - Well if it's so sick, why would you even bother? - Well some people just need more time. But ultimately, you need to tell us what is important to you. - Please call reception. Dr. Crawford, call reception please. - Well being kept alive on machines is not my idea of living. - Honestly, I would like to see you take what energy you have left and spend it enjoying your life. - Coming through, watch out, heads up. Ooh, this statue is heavy. How in the world were you able to catch it? One, two, three. Oh. I think you need Mary to be with you. I'm sure she would miss your attention. Thomas, do you need anything else? - Dr. Styfan and I had a good talk. I would like to be kept comfortable. I don't want any machines. You know I just wish there was someway I could go home. - Listen, I'm glad that you were able to talk. Now tell you what, I'll notify your cardiologist, I'll ring in some orders and I'll see what I can do about getting you out of here. Okay? In the meantime, I'm going to ask the nurses to medicate you if you have any pain or discomfort. And I'd like to stop all blood draws. I'm also going to ask the nurses to reposition you only if you request. And to let you eat anything you want. And the statue of Mary is to be left at Thomas Brownrigg's bedside. Anyone wishing to remove the statue must contact Dr. Adam Styfan for permission. - So we can meet with Barbara Shelley at three? - Yeah, three to four. - You asshole. - Dad? Oh, why Dr. Styfan. Whatever could be the problem? - The problem is you. I got 12 phone calls from nursing supervisors and security personnel insisting that I bring back the statue of Mary? They weren't buying that a statue was providing comfort to a dying man. I tried to convince them that the statue looked like Thomas' dead wife. Then I went with he was lonely. I even tried to say that the statue was a part of Thomas' legacy where nothing worked. I had to come back in, sleep next to the statue of Mary while reassuring Thomas that no one was going to touch her. I don't think the nurses like me very much. - I wanna thank you Adam, for a job very excellently done. Why don't you go home now and get some sleep? I'll take care of things from here. - Hey, Adam. Wait up. - Okay. - You finally got this. You finally got it. He's a keeper. Mr. Thomas Brownrigg is a 68 year old male with end stage cardiac disease. He's a widow of two years. Thomas works at St. Mary's in housekeeping. He is comfort measures only. Thomas is very weak and unable to care for himself. - What do you think of my cool commode? - It is not a commode, it's a wheelchair so don't pee in it, but I like it. - Eh, wheelchair, commode, same thing. Ooh, ooh. - What? Ooh, yes, very intimidating. Mhmm, very scary. - Something tells me I've been set up. - Yeah, hey! Oh, Michael, that's a nice ride. You really went all out. Nice balloons. - These are supposed to be gears. - Look like balloons to me. - These are my brakes. - You know, I'm actually a little nervous. I think there's a good chance you could beat my time. - Okay. - If I give you a two hour head start! - Okay! Where are you going? - You're in trouble now, Michael. Catch me if you can! - Coop, wait up! Get over here, you gotta let me see this thing. - It's been a long time since I've seen him be this happy. - You better get up. You better get Michael some oxygen. Great teamwork, Dad. I do believe that's mine. - I surrender, sir. - Yes! Victory is mine! - Hey, I gotta get back to the meeting. So, why don't you stay, hang out, take a ride on the chair and I'll cover for you? - Yeah? - Yeah. - You're the best. I'll be there in a few minutes. - Okay, yeah. I'll see you, behave yourself, bye bye. - Cooper! I can stay! - Thank you for taking the time to join us, Michael. - I have a good excuse for being late. I was actually busy getting humiliated by Cooper. I mean, you should have seen it. It was amazing how the race challenge actually helped Cooper's morale. He was just so glowing with pride when he showed this outrageous machine to me, just, I wasn't actually crazy about my humiliation part. - We all need to make sacrifices, Michael. I'm glad to hear Cooper has recovered enough from his surgery to be more active. I take it the pain pump is working well. I just hope we can keep him out of pain for a while longer. Now is a good time to have a goals of care conversation with him and his family. - Yes, Michael I hate to say this right now but we have to be realistic about where Cooper is. - Michael, she's right. We can't wait too long. It's time. - All right, I'll help set up the family meeting. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, Michael. - Thank you everyone, for coming today. I think we all know each other, so I'm gonna dispense with introductions. We're here today to talk about how to support Cooper and his family. And we wanna establish a good understanding of what your values and your wishes are, okay? - First I wanna thank all of you for having us. I know it's unusual to have the patient come to one of these. So I appreciate the opportunity. So I'm dying. You see, I know I'm dying. I know my time is limited. The cancer has gotten into my spinal cord fluid. - As your body becomes weaker, we need to know, Cooper, how aggressive you want us to be. - I don't wanna be kept alive artificially. I don't want machines, I don't want feeding tubes. I just want to spend what time I have with my family, and to have help controlling the pain. - What if the only way we have of controlling your pain is to keep you sedated all the time? You wouldn't be able to interact with your family. - I can't interact with them now if I'm screaming and writhing in pain. So if it comes to that point, then yes, I wanna be medicated. - What we've described is called palliative sedation. We're not gonna deeply sedate you until all other pain medication options are ineffective. Cooper, once we do deeply sedate you, you won't be able to eat or drink anymore. - Cooper, this is true for all patients who become this ill. But this can be especially hard on family. So it's really important that we help you understand this process. And that we know that you're really making the choice that you want here. This is not the route we wanna go but we wanna make sure that you're all informed. - Actually, my greatest desire is to have another wheelchair race with Michael so I can kick his ass again. - I'd pay 20 bucks to watch that. - All I really want is to go home and be with my family. - Dr. Melvin, please report to the Trauma Center. Dr. Melvin, you're requested in the Trauma Center. - Come on now! Kablooey! Dead man wheeling here! - Hey, thank you Coop. I needed that. Let's go. - Look out! - Would a valet operator please meet a patient at the front entrance. A valet operator to the front entrance please. - I think Cooper's cancer is just progressing too rapidly. Now it's starting to get a little rough. - Michael, I know this is tough for you but I know you're gonna do the right thing. - Hey guys. So what's up? - Dr. Roberts and I want to check your pain pump. And Valerie's here to keep an eye on us. This programmer has a scanner attached to a cord that is placed over your pump reservoir implanted under your skin. The scanner can access data from the pump, print it out on the programmer screen and allow me to change settings if I need to. Now, pull up your gown. - Aw, aren't you gonna at least buy me dinner first? You're doing one hell of a job, Doc. But could you speed it up a bit? I'm kinda naked here. - This is great. Someone's finally giving Michael a hard time. - Let's pump up the Dilaudid to five. Everything else is maxed out. - Just fix this here for you. - Oh, that's real professional. They teach you that in nursing school? Oh please, allow me to fix it. I don't mind being abused. I'm only dying here! - Sorry I'm gonna miss the rest of the show but I have to get this. - Sorry, Coop. I know, I'm not acting like my usual self lately. Is there anything else that you wanna talk about? - Just try to keep me out of pain as much as possible. I don't want my family to be any more upset than they already are. - We're hoping that the pain pump will continue to work. And you know if it doesn't, unfortunately we're looking at the deeper sedation that we talked about. - I know. Just help them get through it. - I will. - Just help me get through it with minimal pain and support my family. That's all I'm asking. Well, maybe not all. Actually, there is one more thing. - Anything, Coop. You know I'll help any way I can. - I need you to promise me, Michael. I need you to promise that when this thing happens, you'll do something for me. - Consider it done. - I want you to sing to me! - Oh man, I walked right into that. - Yes you did, buddy. - A little birdy told me that you used to sing in a band. Heard you were pretty good too. And I hope you know the words to the theme song from The Flinstones. 'Cause that's my favorite. Yabba dabba do! - Oh is that a picture of the whole family there? - Hey! Patient abuse! Come on! Hey Doctor Dumbshit. You working all night again? - It's just starting to roll off your tongue a little too easy. Actually, no, I'm just on my way home. Why, do you need me to come tuck you in and sing to you? - Let me have a slice. - I don't have... - Come on, one slice. And I promise to keep my lips sealed about you having the hots for Dr. Crawford. - What? That's ridiculous. I don't, where did you hear that? - Look, I may be sick but I'm not blind. Don't worry, I'll put in a good word for ya. Come on. - The things I do. - Mmm, mmm, mmm. Listen, Romeo. Life's a lot shorter than you think. Trust me, I know. You spend all your time here at the hospital mainly just bothering me. You need to make time for something else. Take it from me. If you're lucky enough to find that special someone who supports you and loves you, don't hold back. Make the most of every minute you have together. Be a man! Don't be afraid to open up your heart even if you think there's a chance it might get broken. There's worse things in this world. - You getting all sensitive on me now? Okay. I think it's time for me to go before all my pizza's gone. - Michael, look at me! Go find that beautiful girlfriend of yours and hold on tight and live your life to the fullest. Because if you don't, then you really are a dumb shit. - See? Now you really do remind me of my Dad. - I love you too, buddy. Now give me another slice and get the hell outta here. - All right. This is Michael Lafata, NP dictating a note to chart on Cooper Davis. Medical record number 34458. Patient is a 52 year old male with renal cancer. Status post nephrectomy and T5 tumor biopsy. Confirmation of leptomenangiomethasthesis, on comfort measures only with implanted pain pump. Discharged home per patient's request one month ago, now at progressively increasing right groin pain unresponsive to aggressive titration of intrathecal pain pump. Patient's wife was advised to bring patient into the ER for further evaluation. - So we're here today to talk about what's going on. - So as you both know, your father is very sick and in a lot of pain. And the only way that we can manage that pain right now is just by putting him deeply asleep, almost like someone who's about to have surgery. It's the only way that we can keep him comfortable. - We know this is bad. Dad warned us this could happen. - I still feel like everyone's giving up. Isn't there anything else you guys can do? - No, there is nothing more that we can medically do in order to stop the cancer that's spreading from his spinal fluid up into his brain. It's causing him horrible pain. And now we just wanna focus on managing that pain. - We're not giving up on your father. We know you care about him deeply and love him. And we care about him deeply too. - Then help him. Don't just let him die! - Your father has fought so hard. His body is tired. This type of cancer does not have a cure. It will only progress and his pain will get worse. Right now we need to do what is best for him. - So what are you gonna do? - We're going to keep his pain pump settings right where they are and add an additionally IV medication called Ativan. The problem is, your father will be in a deep sleep. And he won't be able to talk to you, eat or drink. - And we want to make sure everybody is comfortable with this plan. - So you're just gonna kill him?! - No, no. Tiffany, unfortunately, it is the cancer that is killing your father. This is the only thing we can do to keep him from dying in pain. A body cannot digest food when someone as sick as your father... - Tiff! - Tiffany! - Tiffany. - Tiffany! - I got this. - Tiffany. - I wish there was an easier way. - We should get him on the Ativan drip. Can you order one and get the drip hung as soon as possible? - We can't find Tiffany, what's going on? - I'm not sure, he just started writhing in pain. - This is Michael, I need another two milligrams of Ativan, stat. And please, call the pharmacy, tell them I need the Ativan drip right now! - What's wrong? What happened? - We don't know yet. - I believe Cooper has had a massive stroke. I don't know how much time he has left. - We gotta find Tiffany. - I can't believe this is finally happening. I mean I knew it would. I just hoped. Oh my god, this is the dumbest thing I've ever done. I hope you're happy in there, bud. - Hey. - You see officer, they are killing my father. - What's up, Michael, Valerie? This young lady just caused quite a scene out front. She says you're killing her father. I thought the least I could do is bring her back here. - Thanks, Gary. We'll take it from here. - You two know each other? Officer, I insist you arrest them. - It must be exhausting to stay so angry. You have so many people who can help you through this but you insist on pushing them away. All because you need to stay angry. - Whoah, I'm out of here. She's all yours. Give me a call if you need to. - Thanks Gary. Tell Mom I said hi. - Great, you're all related, perfect. - I'm sorry I left. I don't know what's wrong with me. - It's okay. - Oh my god. Even when Valerie's not here, she's still bugging me. - Go on, read it. - Yeah. Okay. Don't believe the pedestal you placed upon. Well, that's dumb 'cause I deserve my pedestal. Of course now there's a statue of Mary bolted onto it. A power greater than you will determine your patient's fate. Yeah, usually that's the surgeon. Find comfort in knowing you did your very best. Review actions and explore feelings daily. I am. I promise to stay in the present and separate my personal issues from what actually happened. I haven't been very good at that. I promise not to fear feelings of sadness or grief. For it is when the heart is broken that it is most open to growth and change. What? Who writes this stuff? Well you know it's a good thing I'm not suicidal. 'Cause that would have been over with. Michael, where are you? Cooper just died. Okay. Yeah, okay, all right, okay. - It's okay. Hey. - Yeah. - How can I love you best, what can I do? - You're doing it. And you can give me some pizza and some cold beer. That's all I want. - Sounds good. - Right on. I just wanna go home. - I know. - I'd like to order a pizza to be delivered. Yeah, my usual. Thanks. Wow. - Hi Michael, how are you doing? I hope you're better. We're here for you, buddy. Give me a call when you feel up to it. We love you. You know I'm really glad you're taking some time off. Good for you. I think it was a good idea. You've dealt with so much lately. Call me. - Hi, I'm calling about that frisbee set you had for sale. Would you take 18 dollars instead of 20? Or like I could go to 19. All right let me know. - Michael! You jerk, pick up the phone or I'm coming over there and I'm gonna shove it up your ass! - Delivery for Michael Lafa... - Lafata. Yup, delete, delete. Delete. If only my life were that easy. Hey, you're nasty, delete. Hey, you're stupid, delete. - Just don't yell at him, babe. - Where the hell are you? You're not the only one going through grief. I could have been there for you. I could have helped you. But no, you just go off and hide as if nobody cares. - Okay. I suck at this. I had too many days with too little sleep. - Look, Michael. When Danny died, I told myself I was done. I was ready to walk away from this job. I was done. I was thinking about my girls too much. And then I had to refocus and shift and remain present for Danny and his mom. Do you think that hurt any less for me? You've gotta find something that distracts you. You gotta get lost in something. You gotta find something that gives you meaning and purpose outside of this kind of work. You gotta fall in love with something. - Yeah, I... - Like maybe art. Or like journaling. Or like music or biking or something. - What's with all the doorbells and the knocking? It smells like pizza in here. - You dog. Here we've been trying to cheer you up and you've got your own special therapy going on. I was gonna suggest getting the band back together but I see you already found your joy. - Anna's been so amazing through all this. - Thank you. Actually I think that's a really good idea. I think you guys should get the band back together. - See, we should do it. We should get the band back together, man. Rock and roll! - You know what, it's time for us to go. - We could run a couple on Saturday. - No guys, you do not need to leave. You should stay. - I gotta rescue my mom. She's got my kids and you know, sounds like you guys are in good hands. - Yeah he is. - Come on, come on, let's go. - No, but really, this is really great. And you have permission to be in the band. - What? - Thanks? - Way to go. - Permission? What do you mean permission, that's so rude. Who says that? Come on. Here we go. - They're crazy. - Let's never get married. Mmm, thank you. - Ah, you're welcome. - I should have seen that coming. - Here you go. - Why hello. This is Dr. David Olson. After the tone, please leave a message. - Hi, Dr. Olson, it's Michael. Thank you for letting me take some time off work. Listen, I was wondering if I could get involved with the hospital Survivor Celebration this year? That's it, thank you again and I will for sure be back on Monday. So if you take a look at the program you'll see we have some fun things lined up for today. This is yours if you'd like and help yourself, find a seat. - All right, thank you. - You're welcome. Hey. - Hey. - Thank you for helping me with all of this. - Yeah. - You've been great. Yeah I really just, I think I lost sight of patients that actually do well and get better. I don't see many of the successes in my practice. Or maybe it's just I'm too focused on the ones with complications to even notice. - I would like to call upon everyone today. - I'm really, really, really happy that you decided to participate. - Yeah. - Okay, I gotta go. But, I will see you. - Okay. - Okay. - I need one more. Okay. - Okay. All right, now I really gotta go. - May we all remember to celebrate the journey and honor the special individuals who have touched our lives in so many ways. Tonight we take time to reflect. - You know, he's right. It is all about the journey. Remember when I got diagnosed two years ago, I had to remind myself to focus on the journey and that was what was gonna help me get through it. We all need to feel loved and valued 'cause we're not just our disease. And the journey makes the whole difference. - Here to please take the time to recognize what you are personally grateful for. - Your courage and your fight that you have, your kids, your survival. That's my inspiration. - It's my pleasure to introduce the melodic stylings. - Melodic stylings. - Our very own Michael Lafata. - Thank you, Dr. Olson. I would like to thank everyone for giving me the opportunity to be a part of today's celebration. Now I'd like to perform a song that I had the pleasure to write with this very special young lady. Tiffany is the daughter of the patient that we just sang to, my dear friend Cooper. And Coop, if you're listening, I'm proud to say that Tiffany and I have become really good friends. Even though she refers to me as Dr. Dumbshit. I just wanna let you guys all know that our song is about the compassionate work and the involvement that a supportive care team can provide and the amazing people that come into our lives. It's called You'll Never Be Alone. - Yeah, Michael!
