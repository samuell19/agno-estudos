Tangerine. - Daddy. - Tangerine. Officer Wu. Are you coming back to HQ? - Should we save you some dinner? - Sure. We're bringing the suspect back. We got lucky today, picked up a big one. What happened? Six kids in one van. These child traffickers are crazy. We'll get them all! These trafficker bastards! Okay. See you soon. Give the photo back. Hey, behave! - Give it back! - Let go. What are you doing? - Give me the photo! - You're insane. Give me the photo! Sit back. Let go. - Let go. - Stop it! You prick! - Open up. - Sit back. Open up. Officer Wu. Don't you dare. Open the door. Officer Wu. The car lock. Wu! He's getting away! The key is broken. Freeze! Freeze! Don't overthink it. You don't know me. And you... You're our valued business partner. You've got the wrong guy. You name's Guan Ning. From Liaoyuan. Used to work in a bank. Six years ago your daughter went missing. And you've been looking for her since. Sold your house... ...divorced your wife. Six years. Nice going. Anyone else would've given up ages ago. You don't sleep well, do you? That's none of your business. Because you don't dare sleep. You're scared of having nightmares. You'll dream about your daughter. And a massive city. Yeah. You're the one. Stop the car. Stop the car! That's right. The police are looking for you. I'll go turn myself in then. - Everything can be explained. - Go back and you can clear your name. But you may find your daughter if you come with me. The choice is yours. What did you say? Leave him alone. Go west. - Run for your life! - Sis. Good boy. Go. Sister. Sis. Go west. Run... Sis. Sis. Go. Quick. Do as I say. By order of Lord Redmane. Your heads are to be removed. The dead cannot be resurrected. My condolences. Kid. Ouch, it hurts! Come. Cut off this girl's head. And take me to a doctor. I'll give you a good death. Don't you dare kill me. I bear the mark of Lord Redmane-- Sister. We've been running for years. Should I really keep running? Just listen to your sister, kid. Let's see how far you get. Hey! Once Lord Redmane claims your life, you're as good as dead. Your head will hang outside the citadel. The girl will be exhumed. And her head will hang with yours. Knocking each other in the wind. Two big round meatballs. Don't even think about it. He's godlike! You don't stand a chance. Sis. I can't keep running west. I must seek justice for you. That old man's blood stinks. Unbearable. Sent me to sleep for forty years! You're not like that. No. Want to scoop my eyeballs out? Don't even think about it. You really are a juicy meatball! Yes, juicy and tender. A mere mortal. Who wants to slay a god. How fascinating! Take me with you. I love a bit of fun. Do you see that? That's where Redmane is. Go take yours revenge. Go. Seven years ago. I went across the city. To eat crab meat dumplings. It was a two-hour drive, and then I had to queue. You only need one traffic jam, and that's two hours. Gone! Time. It's so precious. Time. The final problem for humanity. At Aladdin Group. Our goal is to give you more time. Today, we use the lamp app to pay bills... ...play games, chat, shop. You can even see a doctor or report a crime. Not to mention eat dumplings. In the past we took two hours to do one thing. Now in two hours we can do ten things. Because we are resculpting time. You can really talk shit. And my daughter? I'm the CIO of Aladdin Group. Chief Information Officer... - ...Tu Ling. - Cut the crap. You said you'd help me find her. We've already found her. Well, maybe not found her. But narrowed the search as much as possible. One of these five girls... ...is your daughter. Can you tell which? I can't. Can't even recognize my own kid. It's not your fault. Years have passed. Don't worry. Once we run a DNA analysis... ...we'll know instantly. When is the DNA analysis? What will it cost me? Just in time. Hi, everyone. Let's continue with my novel... ...from where we left off. - The sister holds the blade. - This is a live stream. - Supporting her exhausted body. - Yes. - The novel is being streamed live. - She looks up at Kongwen. The sister forces a smile. Run. Go west, quick... Before finishing her words... ...a foot... ...kicks her onto the ground. It's the old monk. A black sabre in his right hand... ...pierces the sister's back. The life, slowly leaves her face. In front of Kongwen, towards the northeast. Several hundred miles away, a light gleams in the distance. Kongwen looks towards it. And sees. A city? A city. Sunlight shines through the clouds, and envelopes the city... ...a massive ancient citadel. There it is. The capital of the Ranliang Kingdom. City of Clouds. Your dream. At that moment. Up on the hill, deep within the palace. Redmane felt something. The Lam app, will bring you a better life. Time and distance. Are no longer problems. The young man's eyes, persevered. Aladdin is by your side. I... - ...am by your side. - As he gripped the blade... ...tightly in his hand, Redmane in his hilltop palace... ...suddenly had a splitting headache. It was an old wound, which had somehow burst open. The intense pain caused his great body... ...to tumble down. What happened? Just now. Aladdin Group President, Li Mu. Suddenly fainted during his talk. What began as a small life sciences company. Has grown into dozens of sectors. A large multinational conglomerate. For many years, Li Mu has led Aladdin's development. Sir. What's he writing now? The young man Kongwen... ...decided to go to the capital. Redname sensed it. Caused his old head wound to act up. Are you sure it's him? He's the only right option for me. He managed to lose his own child, yet has no shame. Tu Ling. Your parents abandoned you... ...not Guan Ning. Don't confuse personal life with work. Yes, sir. What is the price? What are you willing to pay to get your daughter back? Anything. Good. Good. You have to kill someone. Kill? Just give him a push. Using your special powers. We've done our research. You're not the only one with such powers. Some feel no pain. Others can produce electricity. And then those like you. You throw stones. With unusual power and accuracy. Look at that. You can even change its direction. Would killing someone really be so difficult? You've been spying on me. Every day we sift through an ocean of information. Looking for what's useful. I mean. How else do you think we found your daughter? Who are you going after? A novelist. The novel you just heard live... Is called "Godslayer." The author's name is Lu Kongwen. Here's the thing. My boss believes that novel is affecting his health. - What the heck? - There's a character called Redmane. Every time, Redmane gets sick or hurt... ...my boss faints like today. That's the third time now. We've tried every "legal" means... ...to stop him from writing. But nothing has worked. And the writer has announced... That he'll finish the novel in three days. Given the way the plot is developing... ...Redmane will die. You're all insane. Your boss fears being written to death? - I know you don't believe it. - Do you? What matters is my boss believes it. Never mind. If you're not interested. Then you may leave. Where's the writer? - In the Twin River City. - I'll kill him. - To get my girl back. - You only have three days. If you want to find your daughter, this is your last chance. Record your dreams. And send them to me every day. Don't let us down. Young Kongwen descended Sacred Wood Peak, left Mount Di. And went north to the City of Clouds. The first two hundred miles were hard. Kongwen was travelling on foot. Upon reaching the Luoshui River port... ...he boarded a freighter bound for the capital. The strange waves and water beasts... ...frightened Kongwen. But luckily he avoided getting seasick. What was to come, Kongwen didn't know. All he knew was that if he didn't look for Redmane... Then there was no need for him to continue living. Redmane... ...was the only soul in the world who awaited Kongwen. Redmane... could sense Kongwen's presence. He remembered Kongwen's father... ...once a friend. And the only man he ever feared. Very well... ...thought Redmane. He'd been lonely for far too long. Damn it! Hey Kongwen. What's up? Damn kid. How did he score? What were you thinking? Are you a moron? What is this? You're a grown up. Pick on someone your own size! Pass it to me. Come on. Pass it! Time for lunch, Kongwen. He comes every day to scrounge food. I can't stand the sight of him. Almost thirty years old. No job. No income. He's the definition of a parasite. What are you looking at? Why are you following me? Huh? I saw you when I was eating lunch. And when I was playing soccer. Why are you following me? I'm... I'm a fan of yours. A fan? You're my fan? So you followed me? Where are you from? I'm from Liaoyuan. And you came all that way to see me? Don't be stupid. What? How did you get here? By plane? Train? - Boat? - Married? - Divorced. - It takes ages by boat. Which of my novels is your favorite? Godslayer. Godslayer, huh? Who's your favorite character? The young Kongwen, of course. So you like the Kongwen storyline better. It seems. The one from Baihan Fang is not interesting enough. What? What is "Beihanfeng"? I'm developing a new character. Someone who's been blinded and can't see the truth. But I haven't worked out how to write it. Redmane... ...sensed Kongwen's presence. Hello. Why are you speaking to Kongwen? Just do your job. You're listening in? Is that strange? Of course it's strange! Hello. Stop talking to him. Finish the job. Stop ordering me around. Tell me... What does Kongwen mean by "Beihanfeng"? I didn't see this in the novel. Didn't you show me the entire novel? I'm helping you kill someone, and still you hide things from me? What difference does it make? Fine. I'll ask Lu Kongwen myself. Who is calling me? My fan. I forgot to ask your name. - I'm Guan Ning. - Guan Ning. What's up? You mentioned a "Beihanfeng." In your novel. - No it's Baihan Fang. - Who's that? Are you okay? You almost killed me. Oh sorry. I was just dozing off. Are you okay? Fuck you! Sorry. I just called the police. They'll be here any minute. Hang on. Guan Ning? Guan Ning. I didn't dream about my daughter last night. Which is weird. But I went into that city. It was so big. There were armed men. Something crimson wrapped on my head. I couldn't see anything, I just kept running. Someone was chasing me. But I couldn't tell who. This is the capital. What a city. Is this some kind of carnival? You'll find out soon enough. Kid. - Are you alright? - Grandpa. I can see you're well prepared with all this equipment. Sir! What lies ahead? Why is everyone scrambling to get there? To worship Lord Redmane. DRAGON DISTRICT, CITY OF CLOUDS Lord Redmane! Lord Redmane! - Kneel down. - Bless all sentient beings! Bless all sentient beings! Where the dragon soars! Where the dragon soars! All enemies fall! All enemies fall! Lord Redmane! Who's this guy? Redmane. He's no mortal like you. Where the dragon soars! Where the dragon soars! All enemies fall! All enemies fall! The dragon rises, Baihan falls! The dragon rises, Baihan falls! Steal the paintings! Snatch the silks! The dragon rises, Baihan falls! Steal the paintings! This is no festival. Of course not! This City of Clouds had 18 districts. Now only the dragon district and Baihan remain. How come? Redmane ordered everyone to fight each other. Until they were no more, ha-ha! BAIHAN DISTRICT It really is a war. Why does everyone look so happy? This is a world of chaos and madness. And it's all because of Redmane. But you... Do you really think you can kill him? Snatch the silks! The dragon rises, Baihan falls! Steal the paintings, snatch the silks! Archers forward! Archers forward! Archers forward! Release! Release! Shuan Zi! Release! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all! Dragons! Release! Tar. It's hot tar! Burn! Burn them to death! Lord Redmane! Bless all sentient beings! Where the dragon soars all enemies fall...! No! Want to run away? - No you don't! - Let go of me. Amid the coming calamity. There will be parched lips and dry throats. But in the joy of today. Everything is pleasant. As summer fades to winter. So Baihan's image will fade. This can't be real. You're frightened. What's wrong with this city? By order of Lord Redmane... ...your heads are to be removed. Move. It's getting dark. Don't miss the curfew. The car that hit me yesterday... You set that up, didn't you? Your behavior yesterday was terrible. I guess you no longer want to find your daughter. And she probably doesn't want to see you either. Bullshit! You know nothing about losing a child. Pull him out. Tu Ling. Tu Ling! Daddy, come and find me! You can do it if you try. If not the monster will get me. Daddy will beat the monster. And rescue you. I said pull him out! You're a tough one. I won't die. I will bring Tangerine home. She's waiting for me. Hello sir. This is reception. There's a Mr. Lu here looking for you. I'll be right down. You dropped this. A room card was inside. That's how I found you. Can you show me around? You know, somewhere not so crowded. Have you read it? - Read what? - Godslayer. I updated it last night. - It's not loading. - Your phone's a piece of junk. My words were flowing last night. All thanks to your little notebook. It really inspired me. - So thanks. - You're welcome. My little notebook. Wait. Why were you reading my notebook? I know, I should've asked. But I've been stuck in this rut so long. And it was driving me crazy. Those ideas in your notebook, how did you come up with them? None of your business. I dreamt them, that's all. Sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. You know. In the past. I wasn't such a nerd. I was really outgoing. Even had a girlfriend. But this one time... ...I read a novel. From the library. It was called "Seesaw." And it really touched me. That's how I fell in love with novels. Once I started writing. Nothing else mattered. Nothing. At all. Enough bricks. Let's go. Writing and writing... And by the time I realized it. My girlfriend had gone. My diploma had been cancelled. I couldn't find a job. But I felt fine. I had my novel to write. Though I felt bad for my mother. Now it's been six years of writing. Six years? Yeah, and it doesn't exactly pay well. I live off my mother. Six years and you still haven't made it. Just... ...stop writing. It's hopeless. No matter what people say about me. I always believe... ...I can do it. As long as I keep writing... ...my existence... ...has meaning. Did you hear that? No? On a deserted street... Kongwen recklessly chased the crimson cavalrymen. That talking armor hasn't spoken in a while. Maybe he's fallen asleep. Come on, let's go home. You're so heavy. Go away. Go away. You've lost him. He's already cold. Is this your brother? You could say that. Prized from the dead people's mouths. They can be traded for food. Those cavalrymen. Who were they? When they blew their horns. Why did everyone scatter? You're not local? No wonder. Those are Redmane's personal troops. When there's no fighting a curfew is imposed. They come out and blow their horns before sunset. After dark... No one is allowed out. What happens if they do? They'll die. If not for you... I'd have been dead ten times over. This crimson stuff... I can't see anything. Little girl. What's up? Not good. The sun. The sun? I forgot the time. Don't worry. Run quickly. This way, quickly. This way. Over here. Dead end! Up to the roof! Get up. Come on. You can't run fast carrying me. Here. Over here. Come on, hurry up. Stop! Run. Run. Do you hear it? It's coming again. Guan Ning. Guan Ning. Guan Ning. Guan Ning. Guan Ning, help! Little Tangerine. Oh, little Tangerine. Soon you'll grow big. Boing, boing, boing. Little Tangerine. Oh, little Tangerine. ♪ Soon you'll grow tall. ♪ ♪ Boing, boing, boing. ♪ ♪ Little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ Oh, little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ To grow tall you must eat your fill. ♪ ♪ Little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ Oh little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ Soon you'll grow tall. ♪ ♪ Little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ Oh, little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ To grow tall you must eat your fill. ♪ ♪ Teehee it's me, lovely little Tangerine. ♪ ♪ Daddy says I'm the best little lady on earth. ♪ ♪ But my daddy's a fool. ♪ ♪ Please forgive him, mummy-- ♪ This song. Who taught it to you? Where did you hear it? Tell me, tell me! Where did you learn this song? Tell me where you learnt this song! Speak! Yu Changhai! Get him! Get him! Bastard! Stop beating me! - Stop beating me! - Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter? Tangerine? Little Tangerine? Yes. Tangerine. Little Tangerine. Where is she? Man... Just listen to me. I didn't do it on purpose. But I put your kid... In a sack... And locked her in the trunk. I was scared she'd make a noise. So I drugged her. That was my first time. I was an amateur. I didn't know the right dose. So I gave her a bit too much. When I checked her later. She... She didn't wake up. This is rain, don't you know? It's called "rain." Raining. You haven't played in the rain before. Want to try? Let's go. I really didn't mean to. I have money. Really. I can pay you. Man, I'll pay you. Go back to the hotel. I'm going to kill him. - Didn't you hear what I said? - Move! - He's awake. - Take care of Guan Ning. We need him. Yu Changhai said... My daughter is dead. He must be mistaken. Or is lying. You have to be certain. You have to reassure him. Those five girls... Was any one of then actually my daughter? There's no hope. There never was. You're in a fragile emotional state. I'll get someone else to do this. You should stand down. Tu Ling! What did you say? We can't let him go. We need him to kill Lu Kongwen. Where's Yu Changhai? We have him. I'll find a way to turn him in to the police. He'll get the punishment he deserves. Punishment. Hand him over to me, not the police. One life for another. That's what we agreed. There's no going back. I'll trade Lu Kongwen's life... ...for Yu Changhai's. Tomorrow is the last day. Wait for my call. Just now... You really wanted to let him go. Those five girls... Were all fake, weren't they? Of course. Guan Ning spent six years trying to find his daughter. - How do you think I could find her? - You used his dead daughter. You're feeling sorry for him. Guan Ning is just like your parents. Threw his kid away like a piece of garbage. Discarded. Or misplaced. You're a piece of discarded trash, too. And yet you feel sorry for him. Why must it be Guan Ning who kills Kongwen? It just has to be him. It's essential. Go, go. Long ago... The emperor had two favorite generals. One was called Redmane. The other Jiutian. They were sworn brothers. But for a long time, the emperor didn't attend court. And Redmane ruled on important matters. People said the emperor was dead. Redmane had them rounded up and beheaded. After Jiutian heard. He returned with his soldiers to see the emperor. Redmane said to Jiutian... Go home my good brother. Obey me and I'll make you prime minister. Jiutian refused. And started a fight with Redmane. What happened then? Jiutian was killed. And declared a traitor. His whole clan was wiped out. Redmane resented the citizens who helped Jiutian. So he turned the 18 districts against each other. Time passed. And it turned into a war. Whenever fighting starts, Redmane lets off fireworks. I guess he likes war. Dad. Mum. I'm home. A few years ago... My parents went out for food. And must have missed the curfew. They never came back. My dad painted this. My mum in her childhood. It's beautiful! Such art was the most precious thing in Baihan. All of the paintings in the district were looted. It will be light soon. They'll come to take my mum's paintings. And kill me as well! Run away with me. There's nowhere to run. The world belongs to Redmane. Kill them all! Wipe them out! The door's locked. Over the hedge! Open the gate! This way. Search this place. Look for paintings. Nothing's left. Not a piece. Damn it! Someone's been here. There's nothing's left. Let's kill these two brats and be on our way. I won't let you tie my head to a tree. Really? So this is how you're going to die? How boring. Hello. It's Guan Ning. Where are you? You were right yesterday. For so many years... I have kept writing. Without any success. And at the expense of my mother. I've been too reckless. Yesterday, some madman was throwing rocks at me. I thought I was going to die. I could hear my heart... Racing in my chest. It was so clear. For a moment. I thought... ...dying would be easier. I'd be at ease. So at ease. I understand. All our lives we live on hope. But that hope... - ...is never forthcoming. - Just think of my father. One day he was fine... And gone the next. If somebody pushed me off right now... It would solve everything. I would sincerely thank that person. Unfortunately... I still haven't finished... ...writing your character. What do you mean, "my character"? I told you. In your notebook. The warrior. With something crimson on his head. "I can't see anything." That was so cool. I put you in the novel. Yesterday. I hurriedly wrote it in your notebook. Well, technically speaking. It wasn't you I wrote. More like... A crimson warrior. That grew out of you. Run. The wound on the warrior's head... It's exactly the same as yours. Identical. From what you wrote... The warrior doesn't seem to be chasing Kongwen... But chasing the girl. I think... - ...he was after the girl's flute. - A flute? I don't know. But the warrior... He was enchanted by Tangerine's flute playing. Tangerine? Who's that? The girl in the story. That ten-year-old girl. The one from Baihan Fang. She lost her parents. Every time this Redmane gets sick or hurt... My boss faints like today. That's the third time now. I guess the one in Baihan... Isn't interesting enough. So I wrote you into the novel. And because of your dream. My boss has determined it's you. He thinks this is fate. Bring Tangerine home. She's waiting for me. Daddy, come and find me! You can if you try. If not the monster will get me. Daddy, come and find me! You can if you try. If not the monster will get me. Your novel... Can it change reality? That's a strange question. A novel changing reality. I don't know... But I do believe... That the novel's world and people... ...exist. Somewhere... They are just like us. Living. For real. Although they evaded the crimson warrior... ...Kongwen and Tangerine were surrounded by a mob. How do they escape? Well you're the one writing it. Then you can decide what happens next. Tell me. That talking armour... Who's side is it on? The armour feeds on Kongwen's blood. So those two have this... ...weird symbiosis. Well that's clear. I get it! They're going to kill Tangerine. And take her parents' paintings. Your heart is racing, young man. I'll kill anyone who lays a hand on this girl. Ah yes, the taste of blood. Kill them! Hang their heads on a tree. Monsters. Cockroaches. Come. Let me crush you. Run Tangerine! My meatball. Stop! Enough! Hurry! Run! It's you. No. No. No. No. Impossible. How could it... What's this for? Get up! Are you okay? Done yet? I've had enough. What are you sighing for? I really-- What the--? Hey. Ah! No! Please! I didn't think... ...that you would be so... ...mean-- - What else do you want? - Kneel. Never! For four hundred years... I never expected that. A mortal... ...controlling me. You drank too much of my blood. So what? Your blood is tasty! - I've held back for four hundred years-- - Return. Bastard. Bastard. You bastard! Tu Ling. I know you're listening in. I quit. I won't let Lu Kongwen die. Once he finishes the novel... ...I'll turn myself in to the police. Tangerine. Wherever you are. Even if you can't come back. Even if you're only in the story... ...I will make you live on. - Who on earth are you? - I've come to kill Redmane. I know the way... ...to the mountain palace, I'll take you there. You're so full of ideas. Perhaps you could do me a favor, and help me to finish the novel. You'll be the first to read it. This guy. My dad. - I mean the man next to him. - That's a friend of my dad's. It's... Yes. The famous Li Mu. They went to medical school together. My dad... ...founded a company with him. Then one day they were in an accident. And my dad died. Take a break. Let's find somewhere quiet. You knew Lu Kongwen all along. He's your business partner's son. Why did you hide that from me? How did his father die? What else are you keeping from me? I didn't tell you for your own good. Do you really believe his novel can kill you? Or you just want kill them all? I believe in karma. After Lu Kongwen and Guan Ning... I'm next, right? So I'm quitting. With immediate effect. Mr. Li. We checked a few days ago. And all of your levels were good. Today there are a few abnormalities. Yet still within the safe range. If you're still concerned about it. Then please come back without delay. And we'll do another thorough check. Ma'am. Is this your car? Please move it out of the unloading zone. Cool, huh? There's a lithium battery inside. With a very powerful current. Want to try? I actually thought you were generating power yourself. You've seen too many sci-fi movies. I'm just harder to electrocute than most people. As a kid I was always touching power sockets. To charge myself... And then shock the girls at school. It was so much fun. Sorry. I'm bothering you again. It's okay. You can use this place whenever you want. - Keep the key. - Okay. For some reason... The path was not patrolled by Redmane's guards. When it should have been. So Tangerine and Kongwen made it to the palace easily. Don't risk your life. Go home. I've heard that... Many who disappear end up in the palace... ...as disciples of Redmane. My parents might be there. I must go and find them. Kongwen. Come back. Kongwen. I know why Redmane has imposed a curfew. His soldiers can't move at night. Redmane doesn't want people to find out. Let's go. I'm going down for a walk. I'll be back later. Here. Take this! Where is he? Where is he? Let's split up and search. Still making progress? You must yearn for death. Help me get vengeance. When Redmane is dead... - ...I'll let you go. - Don't take me for a fool. I'm the one who killed your sister. My real enemy is Redmane. I already killed you once. I have no hatred for you. All along... ...I've treated you as my buddy. Come on, one more! Come on. Come on. Have a look. Running out? Look carefully. I'll switch myself to the highest current. Really. You won't feel a thing. Trust me. It feels good. Come on, try it. Come on. Rubber glove. Wooden floor. Insulation. How could you be so evil? The drumming is getting much louder. But there's no sight of the drummer. Hey. - What? - Armour, what does Redmane look like? I've never seen him, no one has. You should go back. - Redmane. Show yourself! - You're scaring me. My name is Kongwen! I've come to kill you! Nobody's home. Take my advice and leave. That's not drumming. Not from drums. It's his heartbeat. Redmane. You damn fool. Alright, that's enough. Just give up. You should go to the hospital. I knew this face. Unmistakeably. Of the same breed. What are you talking about? You really don't know? The year you were born... ...I went to see you. Your name is Kongwen. You're the son of my sworn brother... ...Jiutian. From the start... ...I should never have let you and your sister live. That is true karma! But it's fine. I've been alone... ...for way too long now. This Jiutian you speak of. My father... Was killed by you, too? I'll take you... ...to see your father. Don't try to run away. You know... You can't escape. Did you see that? Between his eyebrows. There was a sword stuck in there. It seems Redmane isn't so invincible. Let's do it. I'll cover you. Your father is here. Killed beneath this tree. And buried here too. Before I became a god... He was my best friend. We fought battles together. Drank together. Chatted. I miss him dearly. You killed him! Right. Sadly mortals cannot escape death. It would bring me such joy... ...to kill him a few more times. Tangerine. Stay back. - How do we fight him? - Chop off his feet. Go get him. Watch out! A mere mortal. Daring to slay a god. You don't deserve to be a person. You're a demon! Go get him! When I held your father in my hands... ...he struggled for quite a while. Now I'm wondering. How long could you last? Take this! Let go of me. Meatball! I shall kill you, slowly... Girl. What tune is that? It's one my father taught me. He said. Whenever I play this tune... ...he will come to rescue me. Your father lied to you. Enough! It's getting on my nerves. Tangerine! My fault, my fault. The novel is behind schedule. I have to finish it. Stay here overnight for observation. Sorry. I've come late. It seems... ...this Lu Kongwen... ...won't make it. My original plan was for the police, to think you'd killed yourself. The police would also have discovered... ...Tangerine's name in the novel. - And that she's so similar to my daughter. - Also... Remember the dream diary you sent us? I um... forged your handwriting, and livend up your dreams. This proves my suspicions. Kongwen is linked to Tangerine's disappearance. That's why I wanted to kill him. You hacked my phone. - So I wouldn't read the parts about her. - What a coincidence! That your daughter is also called Tangerine. That's why you chose me as the fall guy. Once I died, this case would be closed... ...and no one would suspect you. You'd both better leave now. You'll get your compensation. Five million each. You think you can sweep this under the rug. But the death of Kongwen's father... ...is enough to bring you down. Don't like the taste of losing. Call the police. We're accomplices. Want to go down together? Just move on with your life. Alright. I'll need the computer. Guan Ning. Be quiet. I need to finish the novel. Is this a joke? You don't know how to write. All you can do is throw rocks. I realize now. I wasn't sent to kill Lu Kongwen. I am here to help him finish the story. I had those dreams... Because Tangerine was calling me... ...from the other world. He's really lost it. You've really lost it. You think you can write her back to life? You don't have that power. Yes I do. Because I believe. You're insane. Give it to me. Tu Ling. I'm really curious... To see if this novel can write you to death. ♪ I'm Tangerine, loved by all who set eyes on me. ♪ ♪ Mummy says I'm the best little lady on earth. ♪ ♪ Mummy says I'm the best little lady on earth. ♪ ♪ To grow tall I must eat my fill. ♪ I believe... ...I can write this. Give Tangerine back to me! Such a stubborn girl. Tangerine. It's useless. No one is coming to save you. How vain the hopes of mortals! Tangerine! Daddy's here! Say hello to my big pal, you ape! Dad, I'm here. Quick! Save me! Take this! I'll kick your ass! Having fun? Who's the boss now? Tangerine. Your dad really came. Reload. In the name of the moon, I'll punish you! Human cannon! That blade on his forehead. You're alive? Dad. What the--? I must help him. Dad! Tangerine! Daddy's here! You can't pull it out! Return my father's blade. Stop! Return my father's blade. I don't want to die. There's so much more I have to do. I... ...need more time. I... ...can surpass everyone. And become... a true... ...God. God. Beat the monster for me, daddy! As you wish! If my parents were like you... I wouldn't have met Li Mu. The doctors asked me to tell you Lu Kongwen is stable. Li Mu. The cops are on their way.
