THE SECTION written by: photographed by: directed by: .... .... .... .... .... .... Quick... I'm swapping our lamps... You're leaving... You won't need it anymore... - Am I leaving? - Yes. - Where? - Somewhere. - Why? - Why? Don't pretend you don't know. You've got a promotion. The day she departed, everybody praises Gizella Weiss. Even the director himself congratulated her. That's it! Your work is... excellent. Your plans are superb. Congratulations! You're a born leader. And now go. - Where? - Goodbye! - Goodbye! - You've been promoted for your achievements. There's a management plan for you. You will be sent to a place where you can realize the ideas that you wrote in France. - Will you build? - .... .... Cheers! Yes? Coming! I'm leaving home for a few days. I've left my bedding in the attic. I'm going. - What bedding? - Nothing. .... Bye. - What's up....? - Nothing, just leaving... a few days. Gizi! Gizi! Just a moment! .... If your ex-husband is looking for you, what'll I tell him? I tried to call him, but again I couldn't get through. I've got an assignment. The institute knows where I'll be. If he comes, I'll tell him you wanted to talk to him. ... - I thought I'd wait for you. - Thanks. And who's there? I am, hello! Oh, hello! - You will go on to the car? - No. Sit down. I'll go with you. - We'll travel together. - That's fine. .... - Don't you have any luggage? - No, I haven't. Not even pajamas? You are in uniform. No. no. I will be there. - So you travel without luggage? - Yes! Best to travel with hands in pockets. - I always wanted this. - .... - Where do you want to sit? - Never mind. I want to sleep. I like to travel facing forwards. - Then we'll turn off the lights. - No. Don't. I don't want it! No! - Won't you take off your hat? - No. I've a medical problem with my head. I need to wear a hat. - Are you asleep, Gizella Weiss? - No. .... .... as if you were asleep. - I envy you. - Me? Why? This. I see you, as if asleep. Yes? You were awake listening, weren't you? Just like you're asleep. Damn! You're working and resting at the same time. - How can you do this? - I just can... But... no problem? - I remember you. - Yes? Yes. The preparatory courses... then you went abroad. All things came to you... And haven't got men's shoes... - Who? .... - The scientific cats... - That's right, yes. You are full of ideas. You're good! .... I like to work. Is that wrong? My ex-husband said: I betrayed myself, when I work. I haven't seen him for a long time. What's with him? - He's here, to the best of my knowledge. - Here? - Where? - Here, in the city. He wanted to return to the Union, but he failed. Return to the Union? It's not so simple as here. Almost... - Do you want an apple? - No, no... - My teeth.. aren't so strong. - I'm eating all of the apple. Just the pips, I won't... - It's healthy. - What? Your outlook on life. You're a new type of woman. Good origin. Yes. I didn't know my parents. Nobody there. - The water is cold. - We will immediately take off. Someone threw them. They shouldn't be so wet... You're dreaming. Gizella Weiss, dreaming. This way! Don't be afraid, just buy a newspaper! - Really? - Yes. I feel that, it won't start without me. The window is covered with mud, can I have...? None of your business. - Bye. - So... you're not coming along... No. I'm going somewhere else. - I thought... - No. - I came this far. - Why do this? They asked me to, Gizella Weiss. It's my job. Bye. OK. bye. 3rd class, get off! .... Damn it! Go, go! - Me too! I'll get off! - That's impossible! You must stay here! Don't go alone... Fuck it, kids... Where is there some water? ...... 'Smoldering beneath the site...' 'Borgova 1 and 2.' ...... ...... 'My sweet Ilonka, there is uncle Sandu...' I haven't seen so much mud before... Doesn't it ever dry up? Why? It's not necessary to go... ...... Borgova 2. What did you do to end up here? I won a tender! Yes, yes... that's it! You won! This is the 'Peace body' site! I'll wash off my boots... - I imagined you like this. - What? Together with the documents sent with the photograph of you. I looked out the window at you. I waited to see if more could be recruited today. Your section isn't here. Where? Far away? No not far away. - A little bit away. - Ah, Good. - Far away? - Nothing is far from... - What about your boot? - A little heavy, wet. When it dries it will be easier. Of course... The handcar starts in the morning. Transport wellingtons anyway.... .... What are you doing?! Can I make a phone call? A phone call...?! - Sure. - I have to call someone. So, you want to make a call to someone? Sure. Please, enter it in this notepad. Later, in the morning the secretary forwards the message. It could of course have been. A text on the mirror's upper half: 'I'm still nice.' What is written there...?! These letters are too small. - This is... - Ah. - Just names. - 'Dior... Dior Paris'. .... - These will not be needed. - Yes... I can see! I will rip it! I accidentally left it inside... I wish I could have been at home, but it didn't come to mind. Unfortunately I neglected this problem! This thing is resolved! Let's see! Books! I can see. - Books. - And a dictionary. What makes you think there will be time to read? You already know everything! I just brought this... I came for a short time. Time is always short! I have to take it from you. I can give you a calendar to read. Bye the way... the panties you're wearing... Can I find on them some writing? Perhaps... What can I say...?! See it! .... I rip this... Your fingers are cold! I feel we could work together. I feel so, too... Come on! I'll show you the canteen. Buy and then go to bed. - But it's not sunset yet! - Never mind! It'll set... A rum, please... and an orange liqueur for this Ms! A rum, and a caraway liqueur for Gizella Weiss. 'I measured these.' said the 'bartender'. It's a special... Every woman is special... - Cheers! - Yes! Heard it? I said: "Miss". What do you say? But I know, you have a husband. I know him... I heard it, he returned to the Union. Not yet! No... - You know more than I do. - Do you prefer the orange or caraway? I can hardly choose. I don't like either. You must choose soon! Buy some bottles of it! And buy some salami, too! And... rusks, biscuits... Someone would have to eat them! You will be hungry! You will want to eat everything... Everything in a basket. Just not a cloth basket... it won't fit in the handcar... .... Cigarette? But I don't smoke! But you will... You're don't smoke... up to now. At least... Tomorrow... you will! Take it! I believe you! Lie down... .... Can you sleep... on rubber boots? Let's see... Not too hard... On boots...?! Perhaps, I'll try it! .... .... - Shift change. - What? .... .... Hello, Bucko! .... .... Where are you going? Can't you hear me? It seems there are improvements... Where are you going? - They said: 'Home'. - Home? Maybe... We don't know... Let's go! Let's go. Bye! ..... You didn't greet your colleague! It's not the custom... - Are you angry? - I don't know who he is. Sure... You're not at peace. With who...? With Bucko! - No, I don't know him. - He was the section leader. Don't know... Don't even talk like that! But I don't know him! He's a famous doctor... Potra! Yes, the doctor... I know him. I haven't seen him in a long time... He taught at the university before the Revolution. You see... you see! He doesn't look the same! Now he looks like that. Yes... .... .... I need to go to the toilet... Huh... Warm! ... a woman was sent to the section... - I have to go further. - But not today... You'll sleep here. Tomorrow morning the charcoal burner Jani will come for you. He'll take you part of the way, which will lead to the section itself. Good. Tomorrow. - Can I smoke? - Yes, yes. An ashtray. .... - I see, best if I leave myself. - Yes, yes. What size are these boots? I need a size '36.' .... - Yes!!! - No! Not for money... In exchange for wellington boots. Don't stay barefoot even for a single minute Good deal. I think, we agree!! I'll stretch out my legs and you pull off my boots! I'll like to pull them off, but they can hear from outside! They're observing us... that I take your calf. They're misunderstanding the purchasing of boots. Close the door!!!! No!!! It's impossible!!! The door will stay open! I urge you to pull them off... yourself. Here they are! .... Thank you! Your wellingtons! .... If punctured... They're replaced for free. A good thing for you! Now... come with me! I'll show you the canteen! A rum, please! and an orange liqueur for the Ms.! I measured it! I said 'Ms.'... but I know the truth! Here you will not want to correspond with someone... Do you like the orange or caraway? .... I don't like either... .... I can't choose between them. .... I offer you a glass of two... .... And buy some tins, fish with tomato... cigarettes. Good. - Cheers now! - Cheers! I want to take a look in your bag. - Only a change of underwear. - I see. This is not good for the water here. I get a lot of good advice! .... This will run out... and no more! I will give you 1,5kg of laundry soap. Yours! Here... A bra. .... What's up with this? Some padded gloves... You get everything in the canteen, tomorrow morning in a bag. Remember, tomorrow morning... Jani, the charcoal burner will come for you... To take you out to the section. Where you are expected. Good. In the morning... Gizella Weiss got her bag in the morning. Laundry soap, 30 packets of cigarettes, matches, liqueurs, tins... ... A small box of matches. Two bottles of liqueurs, orange and cumin. Orange and cumin. 20 tins of food, tomato and onion. With tomato? .... With fish. Warm gloves. And there are padded gloves. Sorry, I'm a bit confused! I haven't paid for these! I haven't got any money! No need to pay! Look! We deducted it! Look, we've deducted it. Don't be surprised if you find something in your bag. I won't... Thanks for it. I'll give you four onions. Share it. Don't think anything can go wrong. You're a kind person. Thank you. Once a week I'll give you a bag of boiled potatoes. On Wednesday! .... You see where you have to go? I think so. Someday I'll be back for you... Like Mister Bucko yesterday. We will meet someday. Good bye... Goodbye. Good bye. Where are you? Where are you? I knew that someone would come... But a woman! Yes, a woman. I need... I need... some warm water. - Warm...? - Warm water! You can't light a fire! You closed the door to the water... be warm. I haven't got any fire... The water is out there. I want to be warm... You can't light a fire! If you make it warm the weasels leave. The house is theirs! Just as warm as my skin. Good... but only just. Today is exceptional so we'll light a fire. But you must know it's not right. I'll collect the wood. Who is he? Who is he? You'll find out... He died. Warmth is a bad thing. A very bad thing. If it's hot inside it's cold outside. It won't happen again. You'll see tomorrow... We will stake it. We don't know what we'll do tomorrow. I'll tell you in the morning. We will stake it! We can't do anything else... You'll see tomorrow. Once you start... you can't do anything else. I hope we will be in the shade. - Is it April today? - In a few days it will be April. I thought so. We will be in the shade... Up there the sun shines bright. But don't be afraid, down here, never. You know better. You've lived here a long time out in nowhere. Nowhere? This is the center of the world, Gizella Weiss! You know my name? You can find out mine! Once we skated on campus. .... So we know each other... Can we eat something! I've eaten today. The fire's burning... I'll cook a little cornmeal. I'll take it out there... Run out the whole... to the next morning. Not stay out of it. Please turn away! I'll close my eyes. If you want to watch... it doesn't matter. If you want you can open your eyes... What do you... use for lighting? Nothing. Forgive me, I was stupid... It's not necessary to have light. Forgive me, let me ask you something... - Is there a can opener? - I've some sharp knives. This is fish with tomato. Do you like it? And I've some orange liqueur... and with caraway... Which one do you want? Open one. Here it is. Go ahead. Eat something whilst the fire's lit. I said: I've eaten today. Perhaps the juice, if you like... I wish there was salt! Here it is! The juice... It smells good! I'd like to try. OK. They're wind carried leaves. My own collection... Here it is! Sometimes the leaves swirl in there, ...there, in up there. I know, these are mine. Quietly sailing here. I will gather them... May I try? Try it! I've just one pipe. Try this. - Where can I be sick? - Anywhere on the ground. Are you laughing? Oh my God! I think I'm laughing... Drink... You're 'Brother' or 'Petya'. You're either 'Brother 'or 'Petya'... I almost know who you are... I see you are remembering. Yes, I'm between the two. But I'm not drinking. I'll destroy myself with something like that. I want to survive them... Them, who sent me here. That's enough. Be quiet... Listen... They sent you here to think why you were sent here. You need silence for this. Doctor Potra... or here called "Bucko" - How much time did he spend here? - Silence! Please, don't put any more on the fire. The weasels will leave us... and I'll be alone. Gizella Weiss touched the fading light of the fire. She looked at the time. 7 o'clock... - Presently. - She says... It's night. I am about to leave. - I'll sit here a little bit with you, and chat. - She says. No one will hear. Every morning fill your pocket with potatoes. If your pockets are empty you'll know a day's gone by and they've been eaten. What you just said... You said, cook a little cornmeal... You'll take out there... I don't remember. I didn't say any such thing. I never wanted to cook anything. Are you undressing? At night you don't have to undress. I'll undress. I start immediately towards you. - Please don't. - Yes. Just a little. Stay there! - Wait until I want you. - If I come here you will want me. Where are you? You must be here somewhere. Give me your hand... and I'll warm it up somewhere. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. I don't want it. I'll try to find out your name. At least wait until I forget 'Bucko'. How much time? I don't know... What does it mean... a long time... - But you'll suddenly forget him. - Maybe. In a few years. Maybe. The weasels are running on the torn blanket. Sometimes also grazing the cheek. She calms down... So it will be a while... Main actress: Mari Nagy Others: translated by: Hoparduc (KG, 2016.)
