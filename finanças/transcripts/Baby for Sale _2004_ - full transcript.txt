Hi, nice to meet you. -Hey, I see. -Yeah. That's just great. You know, I read this medical journal at work. - Uh-huh. - Kind of study or something. They said of the thousands of cases they followed, not one handshake ever resulted in pregnancy. -No, really?-I know, I couldn't believe it. Oh, my God. What do you suggest? -You're the doctor.-Well, just a dose of sex might, uh, do the trick 30, 40 times a day. Uh, yeah, I tried that. Mm-mm. Didn't work. Well, we could double the dose. Are you sure you're a real doctor? Step into the exam room,let me show you my credentials. Robin, as Nathalie's lawyer, I'd like you to learn more about her. Nathalie, why don't you tell Robin about your son Evan. Oh, Evan. He's, um... he's eight. Well, he's my stepson. We share him with his mother. Um... he really wants a brother or a sister. I would love for you to meet him. Yeah, sure. Whatever. Have you had an ultrasound? -You know what you're having? -Yeah. A boy. Probably sucks for you. I mean... since you've already got one. Does she have any idea what that's doing to her child? -Do you have any clue? -I'm sorry. -I'm so sorry. -No, no, no. I... Why don't we take a break, huh? Quick break? There's some, uh, water down the hall, Robin, okay? Hey, I'm looking for my wife. -She's in the garden. -Oh, oh, thanks. Hey, I'm so sorry. I got stuck in my way. That's better. I blew it. - Hey, Steve. - Hey. She started smoking when she found out she was pregnant. She's scared to death of labor pains and she's doing everything she can to keep the baby small. Oh. This is why I have to convince I'd be a good mother. Actually, she wants to look at a few more adoption profiles. Okay. That's it. There's a baby out there for you guys. I promise. - Good morning, Nathalie. - Hi. -Hey, Beth. -Hi, boss. How you doing? This is nice. Sweetheart, look at this. ♪ Strange time♪ ♪ Strange place♪ ♪ Every way to...♪ ♪ And please forget♪ ♪ That like that's our way To love again♪ ♪ Sometimes I would♪ ♪ Sometimes I could feel trust♪ ♪ Sometimes I should♪ Here you are.

Come here you Georgia peach. How are you? Good to see you. How did it go this morning, huh? Ah, let's just put it this way, I need to curse my navel and start smoking. Dare I ask about how the in vitro is going. Nothing to ask. Fresh out of eggs. - Nathalie, phone. - Oh, oh. Thanks. Hey, I gotta go. Hey, you do me a favor, okay? When you get sick of your mom, you give me a call, okay? -You got my number? -Yeah. Okay. Don't lose it 'cause you're gonna need it. -Okay. -Yeah. All righty. -You take care. -I need it. Yeah. We'll see you Friday night? Let okay? -I will. Bye! -Bye! Bye-bye! - Nathalie speaking. - Nathalie Johnson? Yeah? Are you registered to Adoptions-Are-Us? Uh, yeah. I just... I registered this morning. We're Really? Good news, Leo. You're fighting off the 18-year-olds by the end of the week. Take note of that. Paging, Dr. Miller. Dr. Miller? What are you doing here? How do you feel about, uh, adopting twins? -Uh-huh.-Uh, honey, where are you going? Uh, I better go take out Leo Azizian's gallbladder. Looks like I got two more mouths to feed. Are you sure you wrote it down right? Yeah. This is where we're supposed to meet these people? The birth mother said, she'll meet us here at 2:00. -I'm gonna call Kev. -Wait a minute. What? It didn't come from Kathy. What do you mean it didn't come from Kathy? I found this adoption site on the web. - You're kidding? - Mm-hmm. This is an internet thing? Don't tell me you posted our adoption profile? Yeah. Our whole life is in that profile, what we make, where we live, the in vitro. They said it was a secure site. If the, uh... I never thought I'd be this age... and not have kids. Sorry. I get it. I get it. Come on. Let's get out of here, huh? We've been had. Hey. Where's Evan? Beth got confused and forgot to tell me he's got some big slumber party. Oh, no, it stinks. Look, I made dinosaurs. What would you do with all this junk food? -Well, more for us, I guess. -Hmm. Have the paramedics standing by. We'll, uh, Pinot with your salt and fat. Oh, yummy. I'll go get the glasses. Honey, come look at this. -What? -Just look. Nathalie, I don't wanna go through this again. Look, it's from a lawyer. We'll have Kathy check it out. Look at her face. Her name is Gitta. She comes from Budapest. Isn't she adorable? His name is Gabor Szabo. I have no way to properly screen him. You really wanna go down this road again? I just wanna met the guy. He's a man we know nothing about. There's a lot of risk here. Oh, risk? You wanna talk risk? What about pinning our hopes in a birth mother that doesn't choose you? Or worse, changes her mind at the last minute. Hey, it's from an attorney. Yeah. Checked out this Gabor Szabo. He's a lawyer living in New York City. -Graduated from Columbia. -See? Nathalie, anyone can put anything on a website. He's not registered with New York State Social Services. I don't know how else to check him out. Lives in New York, he pays his taxes. Why are you so quiet? I'm listening. - The father is American? - Yeah. Baby has a consulate birth certificate, so that's good. You know, what I don't see is, what are the expenses? Yeah, well, the guy claims they've been covered. Medical, legal, all of it. That doesn't sound right. He's a rich kid that's been screwing around, I mean, literally, screwing around Europe. And his family wants him back in college. Nathalie, I know you want this to work out. This is the difficult part of my job were I have to advise caution and point out possible pitfalls. Okay. Okay. Before you go to New York, I suggest you arrange to have the baby's health -thoroughly checked. -Okay. And I wanna scrutinize all the paperwork from this Szabo before you sign anything. Hmm. -Can we have a minute? -Yeah. Sure. Take your time. Honey. It's our baby. I know it. -I feel it. -Nathalie. Steve, I swear, if this doesn't work out for whatever reason, I'll blow up the computer. I'll never mention it again, and we can wait for Kathy to find us a baby. Okay. But I want it in writing. I'm calling my attorney. Kath. Do you have this in different colors? It's kind of drab. -I think so. I'll go check. -Thanks. Oh, so that explains the burning sensation of my wallet. Evan. Does she get my room too? No. She doesn't get your room because she wouldn't know what to do with the game station that’s in there. There is no game station in there. Ah, there will be tonight. There you go. No way. -Way. -Yes way. Go check it out. Wow. Bribery, a perfect solution to sibling rivalry. We're bringing home a baby. - Hi, I'm Barbara Shepherd. - Hi. -Oh. -You must be... -I'm Nathalie. -Hi, Nathalie. -Hi. -Steve. I see they'd left you in here. Come on. Let's find a better place. -Okay. -Come with me. Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main hall. Dr. Kravitz, a visitor in the main hall. - Breathe, honey. - Stop. I've been here. Oh, it's been 20 minutes already. Uh-huh. It's 'cause you insist on getting here a half hour early. My heart's pounding. Steve and Nathalie. Your new baby's here. Honey. Dr. Johnson, Mrs. Johnson. I'm Gabor Szabo. Glad to know you. This is Gitta. Oh, that's beautiful. -Hi. -Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. What? Hi. Hi. Hi, you. Okay. Honey? Honey? Oh, Dr. Johnson. Please let me. Oh, would you? Thanks. Great. Say hello to your new baby. Oh, my God. Smile. She's not saying anything. It's 'cause she's trying to hear the baby breathe. Oh, you can relax, Nathalie. You have a very healthy little girl. There's nothing we should look out for? No gummy bears until she can at least walk. Congratulations. She's beautiful. Now, if you have no more questions,I should call your attorney now. Nurse, can you take the baby? So, uh, we'll take custody in the morning at the hotel? Uh, see you then. Yes. Um, Mr. Szabo... do you think we could keep Gitta overnight? Nathalie, I think the birth mother needs sometime. Yeah, honey. I think we can... we can wait one more night. -I don't see why not. -Really? I considered you're good people. Wow. I see no reason to put off bonding with your baby any longer.

No, on the contrary, - you look very happy. - Hmm. Now, if I could suggest a schedule. -Sure. -Uh, the, uh, birth mother would like to spend some time with Gitta to say goodbye. Not long, 15 minutes or so. -Is that all right? -Honey? Yeah, of course. I mean, she needs that. It's just... It's hard to let go of her. I understand, yes. Maybe you could find some place to eat here. -I'll take care... -Um... ...of Gitta. Oh. Okay? Keep her... keep her warm. Here, keep her warm. Oh There is a restaurant here in the hotel. I'll be back in an hour with the baby. And we... -We can finalize things then. -Okay. Okay. All right. See you. Um, we would love to meet her. The... Janka. -The birth mother. -Oh. It might put her at ease if she knows us. I'll, uh, I'll see if she's open to. Okay. Bye.- -Goodbye. -Bye. Goodbye. Come on. Are you all right? Are you okay? Hello. - Mr. Grazer. - Mr. Szabo, -it's so good to meet you. -Yes. Say hello to your new baby. Oh, she is gorgeous. She looks just like you. Oh, please, Mr. Perryman, let me do that. Well, say hello to your new baby, huh? You have no idea how happy you've made us. We've been waiting for this for so long. I wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart. Hey. I got us a car to the airport.- Okay. Would you eat something? You know our plane food sucks. -I'm eating, I'm eating. -Uh-huh. -I'm eating. Uh-huh. Steve? See? Right on time. Where's the baby? He doesn't have the baby. Honey, you got to pace yourself with this worry thing. We still got teething and chicken pox. - Hi. - Hello. -Hey. -Where's Gitta? Oh, there are some things that we need to discuss first. -Is she all right? -Well, she's fine. Um, certain expenses. What are you talking about? You said there weren't any. Well, honey, reasonable expenses aren't a problem. Our attorney should've told you that. What I'm about to tell you can go no further than this table. Not your attorney, no one. We agree? I don't know. How shall I put this? There are many people. Wealthy people like yourselves who are willing,well, I should say very willing to pay a great deal for a baby like Gitta. Healthy, bright newborn... God. ...who is available for adoption. But like it or not, uh, I don't. There is certain supply and demand. Now it's clear that you love her very much. I don't believe this is happening. But if you want to see her and take her home with you... How much? What are we talking about? One hundred thousand dollars. You got to be kidding. A hundred thousand dollars? You wouldn't spend that in in vitro or surrogate. Or perhaps you already have if I can believe everything that I read about you on the internet. You... you're a sick man. I believe your emotions are clouded picture, Mrs. Johnson. Let me be clear with you, Szabo. We want this baby,but we will do nothing illegal. No secret conversations, no hidden bags of money, or whatever the hell else you got in mind. There is nothing illegal going on here, Dr. Johnson. I have a baby that I'm putting up for adoption and I'm simply covering the mother's expenses. No. - Honey. - Fine. You have my number if you want to change your mind. Now, Nathalie. You should know that there are other couples. One of them has Gitta now. Nathalie? You're a son of a bitch. Will there be anything else, sir? A fresh pot of coffee, please. Nathalie, I think we should let this go. No, I can't. We knew New York was risky,we decided to take a chance. Look,all I'm thinking about is Gitta. How do we get her away from that creep? Nathalie, Steve, I adore you both, okay? I don't wanna be harsh, but you're not hearing me. There's nothing we can do. -We have to let this go. -Kathy... you didn't hold her in your arms last night. That guy knows I did and I am not letting this go. Look, I mean, clearly, the guy is preying on our emotions for profit, right? What the hell do we do? As far as this baby goes, I don't know what else to do to help you. I'm not a criminal attorney, but as far as I know, he hasn't broken any law. I spoke to the FBI like you wanted. Special Agent Ruddy has agreed to meet with you. But he's only going to repeat what I'm telling you. He tried to sell us a baby. How can that not be a crime? Like I told your lawyer, it's not a federal offense. It's slavery.It's one person selling another. It's worse than slavery. It's a baby. Look, I'm a parent. What he did makes me sick. The problem is, it may not even be a crime at the state level or in Minnesota. This happened in a New York hotel policed by New York State locals, not the FBI. Sorry, I know it's frustrating. Look, I got to get to court. Hold on. I'll call the NYPD, off the record. Just as a favor, no promises. See if they know anything about this. -Thanks. -Thank you. See you. Janka. Your baby will go to a good home. And how will you do that, huh? You have no job, no money for a plane ticket and I have your passport, huh? She goes to a nice, rich American family, hmm? I cannot help you if you don't trust me. You trust me, don't you? Be a good girl, Janka. Mr. and Mrs. Perrotta. This is Gitta. Oh, isn't she beautiful? Oh. It's okay. -She looks just like you. -Thank you. You're gonna make a beautiful family. Of course, the most important thing is to put Gitta in a good, stable home. -Of course. -Absolutely. Yeah, your family history is wonderful. I mean, that is, of course, very important for the mother. You bet, I mean, definitely agree. In your adoption profile, -Mr. Perrotta... -Uh-hmm. ...you said you are a builder. Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not like a hammer jockey or anything like that. Um, I'm a developer, you know, uh, strip malls, office buildings, uh, stuff like that. It's a good business. Yeah. We're investing some. They get a check every year, it's more than most people make. Oh, dear. Uh, I mean, not that I'm complaining or anything. Um, yeah, we do fine. As a matter of fact, we got the new wheels there for the kid, you know. Nice. -You just bought it? -Yeah, it's brand new. Brand new. Oh, she's... I think she's wet. So, change her. Yeah, okay. Oh. Yes, we'll change you. Do you want me to change her? Oh, no, no, no. It's not... I mean, it's nothing at this age, actually, you know, it's just a couple of snaps. Uh, you got a couple of wet ones? You know a lot for a man who has no children. Well, yeah, I... Well, you know, I, um, I come from a big Catholic family, you know, an army of nephews and nieces running all over the place. We should, uh, we should probably talk expenses, right? Some other time, I think. Yeah. She's... I'm sorry. Have we said something wrong? I'll stay in touch. Mr. Szabo? Mr. Szabo, wait up. We blew it. What do you think she's worth? - Gitta? - Any baby. What's the right amount to pay? It's not about the money. What he did was wrong. -FBI doesn't think so. -That's not what they said. Maybe Szabo's right. We already spent a fortune on fertility treatments. Nathalie, I was not about to be held hostage by some scumbag. Yeah, but it's really just a matter of who you pay, -isn't it?-It's wrong and we both know it. Is it? What about turning our back on Gitta? -That's not what we're doing. -A baby with no way to defend herself from that creep. Just so we can say we did the right thing. Is that the high road? Because if it is... I'm not so sure I wanna take it. - Ms. Nathalie Johnson? - Yes. Joey Perrotta,New York City Police Department. This is my partner, Laura Jackson. Hi, ma'am. The FBI here in Minnesota called us. We have a few questions we'd like to ask you. Mr. and Mrs. Perrotta. This is Gitta. Oh, isn't she beautiful, huh? Son of a bitch. How is she? She's, um, she's pretty healthy, considering. How many babies has he sold? Fourteen that we know of. Oh, my God. That's disgusting. We think we could get him this time but we need your help. -What can we do? -Well, for starters, we'd like for you to reconnect with Szabo. First, by phone. Make him think you want back in the game. Get him to restate the hundred grand on the phone. Then we nail him when you hand him the money. You mean like a sting? He's a bad guy, Dr. Johnson. But if you need some time to think about it... No, no, no, we'll do it. Uh... Honey, she's worth it, don't you think? What? Doing this, helping us out... Doesn't guarantee you're gonna get the baby. Why? Obviously, we do what we can, but we're cops, we don't have much pull with social services. What do you mean? She goes to a foster home? Until they find something permanent. And what about Szabo? What kind of prison time does he do? -None. -Excuse me? Baby selling is not a felony in New York. What? In most states, Class A misdemeanor like smoking in a restaurant. You got to love lawmakers. Can't you nail him on something else? -Extortion, kidnapping? -Child endangerment. Look, if we could get him on a misdemeanor, at least we put him out of business. And hopefully... hopefully, I could put him in jail even if it is only on a technicality. Okay. I'll make the call, pass the cash. Whatever you want me to do but Nathalie is not involved. Dr. Johnson, there's no sting without her. - Steve? - Honey? Steve, this is not about Szabo, or me, or you. This is whatever we can do to get her away from him, we'll do it. In the fancy stores on Madison Avenue in New York, they serve free food and drinks. We need to practice your English for that. And after the adoption, all the rich New York man would take you out to fancy restaurants, clubs, and parties at the beach. - Oh, Bri. - How are you? No, make it a beer. Okay. Let's get started. All right. I'll meet both of you when you land in New York. New York, yes! Hey, no way, man. How do I know you won't screw me? Come on. Let's see the money upfront. You're a smart boy and I won't quibble with you. Half now, the other half in New York along with your divorce papers. What, no wedding night? He promise I meet a rich American man. That lets me out. - Hi, Elsa. - Hi. Nathalie, please come in. -Hey, honey. Hi. -Hi. -Are you okay? -Yeah. I just, uh... I can't believe we're doing this. We should go ahead with it. Statue of Liberty which is... oh. Hallo? - Hello? Mr., uh, Mr. Szabo? - Yes? Hey, it's, uh, Steve Johnson, uh, calling from Minnesota. Hallo, Dr. Johnson, how are you? Um, well, thank you. Um, first of all, I want to apologize for the other day, I... I overreacted. No biggie. Well, we've been thinking a lot about Gitta and, uh, we really wanna make this work. I understand. We've discussed the number that you gave us and, um... - Yes? - That's acceptable. -Uh, if she's still available. -Yes. For the moment. Oh, this is such good news. We're still talking a hundred thousand, right? Unfortunately due to the delay and the demand, there has been an additional cost of $50,000. Dr. Johnson, uh, is that a problem? When is a deal a deal with you, huh? When Gitta is in your arms, Dr. Johnson. Now if you would like to reconsider? No, that'’s... that'’s acceptable. But that’s it. Are we clear? Good. Yes, we're clear. Look, I'm on business right now. Why don't I meet you back in, uh, New York, uh, at the same hotel on Saturday, say, uh, 11:00 a.m? With the cash? That would be nice, Dr. Johnson. Okay. Bye. Hey, Americans only pay for healthy babies. Nathalie? Are we really gonna do this? Are we getting on that plan? Yeah. - Come on, play. - All right, all right, I'm playing. Whose team I'm on? White. Okay. Oh. Ooh. Oh! Ah. Get them, get them. Yes. Oh yeah, oh yeah. An interception, he goes all the way and it’s a touchdown. And you were so cute as a baby. Come on, play. Get up. Oh. Yes.- Nathalie, get in here. -Evan's making me look bad. -Coming. -Okay. Go easy on me, big guy. -Uh-uh, no bribes. You're taking medicine like a man. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. What are you doing? No idea what I'm doing here. - Hey, Dad. - Hmm? There's a scout expo this weekend at the fairgrounds. I told Mr. Ogili we'd drive. -No can do, hon. -Why not? Well, 'cause Nathalie and I have to go to town. You're gonna stay with your mom. Is this about that baby again? A little bit, yeah. So, when were you gonna tell me? We were. We were. We just... We don’t wanna worry you. I don’t get it. It's not enough this guy jacks you once. It's a little more complicated than that, Evan. Geez, just how desperate are you? All right, come on. Chill out. Grab the bags for us, please. Right away, sir. What's up? - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. Am I crazy? -You think I'm crazy? -Yeah. -Are you sure? -Yes. Can I say it looks like we're pretty ready to go? - Welcome. - Thanks. Did you get something? Wow. Yeah. We're gonna keep surveillance. Strap yourself in. -Hey. -Hi. -Welcome to New York. -Thanks. Sorry about the room. Um... we'll get done wiring about an hour or so. Now, let me give you guys a heads up. We've got a, uh... you know, why don’t we, um... why don't we step into the surveillance room here. We could talk. Please, this way. Yo, can you give us a few? Yeah, sure. -Hey. -All right. Somebody talk to me. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, we put two years into this. We're not gonna blow it in someone who's unsure and can't deliver under pressure. - We can deliver. - Look, we're gonna be a hundred percent ready, okay? If anything goes wrong, we're there. Okay? But if you don’t wanna go through with it, that's okay. It's about my wife's safety. Look, why don’t I meet with him alone? -Steve. -He's gonna smell it -if you're not together. -Yeah. Dr. Johnson, this is really simple. We all know what he wants. Just give him the money. It's gonna be fine, right? - Absolutely. - Absolutely. You know, you know what? Why don’t you guys settle in? Enjoy the suite courtesy of the NYPD, you know? I'll just be in here if you guys need me. Two minutes. The signature copies of the birth mother's consent form. It would be wonderful if you could get her to sign when we pick up Gitta. -But if she needs more time...-No, it should not be a problem. We can't wait to take her home. Sorry to interrupt you, Ron, but I really need you in my office for a moment. This should just be a second. I'll be down the hall if you need me. This must be hard on her. The birth mother. Look, let me have this opportunity to be alone. Mr. Szabo? The price for your baby has gone up. Price? We agreed to a hundred thousand for expenses, I think that's fair. This has to stay between us, not your attorney, but it turns out there is another couple who is prepared to pay a premium. So, what can that be, 10,000, 15,000? -We'll pay it, right, Bob? -Sure. -Gitta is our baby. -No, of course. Actually, I have a, uh, firm offer of, uh, $150,000. Are you insane? And I will accept that offer tomorrow morning by ten o'clock. Mr. Perryman, unless you can come up with $175,000. -You are a bastard. -What is this, an auction now? This is just business. You have my number. Please call if you change your mind. I can't believe this. Fire mode. -You're just saying that. -No. Yeah, like you're just saying that. Hmm. Can I go for a walk? I don’t wanna move. -Hmm?-Let's order room service, hmm? Hmm. Mm-hmm. What? Hey, don’t go, don't go. What are you doing, aerobics? Is there a camera up there? -I don't see one. -Yeah. That’s why they're called "hidden cameras." Are they watching us? -Oh, my God. -You're killing me. There's nobody here. This thing doesn’t get started until the morning. Honey, relax. Huh? This time tomorrow night, there's gonna be a beautiful baby girl in your arms. Uh-uh. I can't think about that. I don’t wanna get my hopes up. Come here. Come back to bed, huh? -Good morning. -Good morning. How did everybody sleep? You tell me, they're your cameras. Uh, we didn’t watch, much. So, I'm gonna give this a test. -You let me know. -All right. Testing one, two, one, two. Oh, yeah, that's good. Hey, um, clip this to your bra but be careful. There's two pointy sharp ends there, yeah. But not to the wire, it screws up the frequency. Okay. Sorry. Okay. -You got it? -Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, I'm gonna need to tuck it, so, uh, I tell you, why don't you go ahead and turn around so I can swing this around you -and the other side? -Hmm. I'll just be in the surveillance room, okay? Thanks. Can you hear this down there, Frank? Yup. - Testing one, two, three. - That's good. Yeah, that's very good. That’s real good. ♪ I'm just living On a perfect day♪ -♪ Riding on a perfect day♪ -Janka. Come here. You need to practice your English, Claudette. ♪ Riding on a perfect day♪ Come. Good to go. Janka. Great news, Janka. So this is pretty much what we'll be able to see with the camera inside the air vent. Hmm. Anything out of the ordinary, go with it. Okay? Let us handle the surprises. Now, on the off chance he shows a gun, do as he says, hands up, we're through that door and we're taking him out, okay? He's pulling up. He's heading into the hotel but he doesn't have the baby. - Yeah. - He does not have -the baby. -What? He does not have the baby. -Where is she? -What? What's going on? -Oh, that. -What, tell me. What? He doesn't have the baby. Nathalie, Nathalie. Nathalie, can you get back. Laura, she's on her way down. Szabo. Hey. Dr. Johnson. What do you want me to do? Get Steve out of there. Ah. Hi. Sorry I'm late. -Too late. -Jeez. Okay, move in tight. Everybody pull it in two. If he smells wrong, jump on him. Let see where this goes. That's why I'm nervous. I understand, it's such a big day for you. Good to see you again, Nathalie. Thank you. So, shall we, uh, go upstairs? -Uh, no. No. -Sure, um... Not without the baby. Well, I thought that we would meet first to some legal papers to go over and... Gitta is in good hands. -You can trust me. -Ah, really? Based on what, Mr. Szabo? Very well, ma'am. -I'll go get the baby. -Great. Um... uh, good. We'll go with you. My car is out front. Damn it! It's a good idea. Hey, I'll take the car. No, no, no. I...Honey, honey, honey. Come here. -Laura, you on that? -Yeah. -They're leaving. -Stay on them, stay on them. Hey. Oh, talk to me. We just turned the corner, we lost them. He's heading over to the apartment in Queens. -Just get over there. Move it. -Yeah. - Sorry, on it. - Got it. So, what's happening? I don't know. Laura, Laura, can you hear me? No, Perrotta, I can't hear you. You're gonna have to call me on the cell. I'll be back in a minute. Unless you want to come with me? Okay. No, we'll wait... We'll wait here. You wanna tell me what the hell is going on? If we had just given him the money, we were never gonna see her again. This was your idea? All right. That's it, we're done. -I'm calling 911. -Steve. -Get out of the car. Now! -No, wait. - Where the hell are you? - We're in Queens now. We're three minutes away. Janka. Look around. Look where we are. -I see it. -This isn't us. Perrotta, we're on site. Nathalie and Steve are out of the car. They're arguing. - Where's Szabo? - I don't know. All right, all right. That's it. That's it. You know what? Bring 'em in. We're done. -Use caution, keep them safe. -Got it. Let's go. There's a million other kids to adopt. -Just let me do this. -No. Uh, honey. I can't do this. I got an eight-year-old kid who needs me, who needs you and me. Just... He's bringing the baby down. It's... Come on, follow me. Oh. Oh. Hey. Nathalie, would you want your baby? Go on, hon. Go on. Oh, yeah. Hon, come on. Come on, Solas. Get down here. Yeah. Yeah, they're getting back into the car. Play it out. Just don't lose them. Szabo's coming your way. Two blocks away from the hotel now. Come here. Yeah. It's okay. We're on. I'll just, uh, go get the cash. This is, uh, copy of the birth mother's uh, medical history. What is that? She's singing, numb nuts. What are you doing? Sure, sure. Okay. Um... All right. That's it. Pick up the phone. This is... Pick up the phone. -You should get that.-Honey, get the phone, will you? - Hello? - Don't say anything, just listen. You got a lovely voice, but you're screwing up my evidence. Now, I'm the front desk calling to see if you need a late -check out, got it? -Uh, yes. Okay. Now say, "No, that won't be necessary," and hang up. - No, that won't be necessary. - Good. Thank you. That was, um, front desk. Just wanted to know if we needed a late check out. -Oh, okay.-This shouldn't be much longer, so. Yes. Oh, uh, here's the money. It's, uh, it's all there, a $150,000. That's right, that's right, that's right. Yes, we got him. Uh, it's all there, a hundred and fifty thousand. I'm sure you wanna check it. We got him, boss. What is she doing? -What's going on? -Where's she going? Oh. Is there something wrong with that mic? No, no, it's on, it's clear. Uh, I put it in the hundred dollar denomination, it's all... All right. Get into position. We may have to go in earlier. - It's fine, I trust you. - Hold up. Hold up. Look in here. I trust you. Yeah, cool. Not bad for a Midwestern girl, huh? Get into position. There's your new baby, Dr. Johnson. Oh, I was wondering. How much do you charge for an operation? Or do you do it for free? What is the going rate for saving someone's life? Gitta. No, no. Oh, you're in good hands, Gitta. Goodbye. Drop the bag right there, right now. Hands on the air where I could see them. Give me your hand. Mr. Szabo, it's good to see you again. You have the right to remain silent. Go! Move! Clear! Police, ma'am, we're here to help you. Don't move, lady. ...cluster shaped in heart. -It's just... -Guns down. Calm down.- All right, get down. ...just 16 of these beautiful items left... Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stand up. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna bring you to the precinct for some questioning. You're safe. Look at that. Oh, oh, nice. You're gonna make the baby cry -Look, it's crying. -Oh, no, just trying to be funny. Much better. Thanks, buddy. I got him. You're gonna help me clear something up. My partner says it's when I mentioned the diaper too quick. I say, it's when she flipped out over the wet diaper. How did you know? -How long do we do this? -What? You pretend to be my best friend until I say something incriminating? Come on, Mr. Perrotta, you're a busy man and so am I. Well, good news, one of us just became very unbusy. Nothing but misdemeanor, no prior offense, no worse than walking a dog without a leash. God help you if you do. You know, it's not so terrible keeping the young girl from abortion, and helping a couple find a baby. Making a hundred grand on the side. Isn't that the way it should be? Being rewarded for doing some good? Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting, that's what you're doing, huh? I sleep well at night. I wonder if the people who lose the baby auction do. I gave the Johnsons the baby. You took it away. Come on. You're gonna sell it to me, you're gonna sell it to the highest bidder. The second I saw you. What? That's when I knew you were a cop. You're not as good as you think you are. I don't care if it's a misdemeanor. I will eat, sleep, and piss in your back pocket and drag your ass in here as much as I have to to make sure that you will never see a penny or hurt anybody else. Do you understand, huh? Good. Good. My wife, she hit me. What did she say? I hit her? Hey, honey, this is all I could find. Thanks. Look at her. Look at that smile. I think the welfare worker is on his way. I know. I know. We know. - Hello. - Honey. -Hmm? -I just don't think, um... What? You don't think I should fall in love with this baby? It's too late. I already am. It's too late. I already am. Not really set up for jamboree, is it? It's okay. -How is she doing? -She's good. Get some warm water. Formula. Get a little fuzzy here. Somebody, pick up my phone please. All right, let's go, people, let's go. Detective Perrotta, Michael Lindley, Social Services. You're late. -We have other cases. -None that I care about. Come on. And I will spend my whole turtle life searching land and sea. Until I find you because you are my precious one,you see? That's you right there. Mm-hmm. That little turtle right there. Nathalie. Not yet. It's time, honey. Not yet, Perrotta, please? Okay. I can't. I can't do it. How do I do this? We'll do it together. Come on. Come on. They're gonna take care of her, right? You promise me. -I promise.-You're gonna take care of her. It's okay. It's okay. I'm so glad you're able to sit down. We're doing a piece on baby brokering. So many people want children and will pay. We heard about the Gabor Szabo case and I'd like to hear your thoughts. He's a sick man who ought to be in jail. There ought to be tougher laws against this kind of thing, and there will be if I have anything to say about it. Hopefully, if this case gets enough attention, something will be done. That's why we're talking to you. Mr. Szabo, you've heard the charges. Are you ready to enter a plea at this time? Your Honor, this is all a big misunderstanding. I have signed adoption papers here from the mother. The police department have physically abused me and treated me as a felon and the DA, he's harassing me with nothing but misdemeanor charges that have no foundation. Your Honor, the foundation lies in the fact that Mr. Szabo has been under investigation for two years now. He's suspected of selling 14 babies for anywhere between sixty and a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars each. That is slander, Your Honor. I have never been arrested before this. I specialize in international adoption, putting unwanted babies in the homes of wealthy, successful, loving parents. He's a baby broker, Your Honor. Living on the edge of the law.- In America, living on the edge is not breaking the law. Is that a plea? Not guilty, Your Honor. After what they've been through,they deserve better than this. I could see that. Ron Grazer, -Dr. and Mrs. Johnson. -Oh, hello. It's a terrific thing you've done. Ron's big in the adaption -lobby here in New York. -You're an attorney? That's right. Szabo tried to sell Gitta to one of my clients. -Really? -Sorry. As long as there's adoption, there's gonna be people like him, trying to twist the law for their profit. Szabo's the worst kind. Well, he certainly shows how far he can go under the current law. I'm hoping that there's hell to pay in the state legislature. That's it? He just walks? Try to hold him on a misdemeanor like this. Hey. It's nice here, huh? A difference between here and Manhattan. It's so quiet. Look at this. We have so much. Maybe it's enough. We have each other. Evan. It's a lot. Your daughter's baby will be fine. Everyone is happy. I don't care about the money, Mr. Nemeth. Hey, Evan. How's about a little raw zucchini? -Hey. -Hey. Come here, you. I missed you. -Come here. -Yeah, give me that. -Yeah. Me too. -Aw, baby. I saw the news what you guys did and I'm sorry about what I said. Honey... I love you. And it was never about choosing her over you, you got that? So, are you bringing her home? -Nope. -Why? I like to have a little sister. It's complicated. Our lawyer is telling us she either has to stay in New York or go back to Hungary. I don't get it. You stand up to a bad guy who could have blown you away, but you don't stand up to a bunch of lawyers? That's lame. So we went home, we thought about it and realized, we have as much of a shot at this baby as anybody. And you're supposed to be the best. Mrs. Johnson, Janka has changed her mind. She's keeping the baby. She can do that. She can just back out? The birth mother can change her mind at any time, to a point. However in this case, it may not be entirely her decision, the family court will have a say. Then we still have a shot. The New York Social Services will file child endangerment charges against Janka to terminate her parental rights. Well, that's good for us. Yes, but... now because of all the publicity, the Hungarian Consulate is making a claim. They don't want to be embarrassed. So... where do we stand? Between two Goliaths. I like the precedent. Two Goliaths. I don't think David would have done as well. Well, then again, the court could reject everything and, uh, just award full custody to Janka. She is the mother, she has the most legitimate claim. Then I wanna see her. I wouldn't advise that. Well, you just said we don't have a chance. How can it hurt? In her mind, you put her in jail. Whatever it is you want from her, I don't think you're gonna get it. I just wanna talk to her. I'm, uh, Nathalie Johnson...- ...I'm the woman who's supposed to talk with her. I know who are you. I don't know why I'm really here. You don't need to say that. I love Gitta. I love your daughter. And all I want is what's best for her. No matter what that means for me. I'm her mother, isn't that always best? Whatever we did, we never meant to hurt you. We just wanted to get Gitta away from Szabo. He's a very bad man. She said she had no choice. Do you know what life is like in Budapest when you're poor? Yes, I understand. But if you couldn't afford her then, then why do you think... you... wait, wait, you know, that doesn't sound... She says-that’s her baby, she'll decide. Of course. Of course. I mean, I didn't mean to imply that, um... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all of this. Easy to say you're sorry-when you have a good life. Lots of money, happy life. You good life. Happy life, lot of money. Yeah. Yeah. I brought this for you. Um... if there's anything we can do to help, anything at all... Mrs. Johnson... Here... for you. Could you ask who the man in the picture is? She says it's Gitta's father. This is the picture that Szabo sent us when we first heard about Gitta. Not bad. It's the same one he sent to everybody. This is the picture that Janka just gave me. A picture of Gitta and her father. Brian Mahone is not the father. This is beautiful. Counsel, I assume you're ready to proceed? We are, Your Honor. Your Honor, at this time, the prosecution petitions the court for an amendment of the charges against Mr. Szabo. To what? to felony grand larceny, Your Honor. Based on what? Do you have something for me? We have a signed affidavit from the alleged birth father, Mr. Brian Mahone. And the results of a blood test he took voluntarily, both of which show he’s not the biological father. May I? Your Honor, that still doesn't make me a felon. Oh, but we believe it does, Your Honor. You see, Mr. Szabo never bothered to get consent from the real father. Instead what he did is he falsified the consulate birth certificate. Showing Mr. Mahone to be the father, but it wasn't the case. So in essence, Mr. Szabo was trafficking stolen goods in excess of a $175,000. A baby? You set the value, Mr. Szabo, not me. Felony grand larceny, Your Honor. I buy it. Mr. Szabo, you're gonna need time to prepare a new defense. Also, Your Honor, defense should be made aware that we will be seeking the maximum allowable sentence. That's no surprise. And in light of the new charges, the State asks for a one million dollar bond. The fact that Mr. Szabo is not an American citizen clearly makes him a flight risk. That is absurd, Your Honor. I have a green card,I am a member of the State Bar, I have roots in the community... All right, we'll hold Mr. Szabo over until we can have a bail hearing. I suggest you get yourself a better lawyer, Mr. Szabo. Next case. Hey. Come here. I am so proud of you. You did what you set out to do. How many men do you think are married to a real life hero? Oh, please. Yeah. Coming. Hey, come on in. I wanted to catch you before you left. Honey. What's up? I just got word. The custody hearing is in a couple of days. The Hungarian government does want the baby back. This should be interesting. So, now the Hungarian government is gonna raise her. Not that this is news, everybody wants her. Why don't we go ask for her then? Because you don't have standing to this court. You're behind the Hungarian government and New York State Social Services, the foster families, and, uh, every potential New York adoptive parent. Well, what's the worst that could happen? Well, you could all end up in jail for contempt of court, but then that's why I stopped by here. I was hoping you'd ask me that. Since the court has ruled that the parental rights of Janka Madyar have been revoked, we're here to determine the custody of the child, Gitta Madyar I think I'd like to go over the opinions one final time. Ms. Souza, you wanna start us off here? Uh, excuse me, Your Honor. I'm Ron Grazer and I represent the Johnsons. We would like you to entertain a motion for the Johnsons to adopt Gitta. I know who the Johnsons are and they have no relevant legal claim here. Sit down, Mr. Grazer. -Ms. Souza. Please. -Thank you, Your Honor. Most of the issues of this case are still pending in New York Criminal Court. And until those are resolved including the child endangerment charges against the birth mother, it is the opinion of New York Social Services that the child remain in our custody, under the guardianship of a foster family. Gitta. I'm sorry? The child's name, it's Gitta. Mr. Consul. It is not a matter for American courts, Your Honor. Both Janka and the birth father,as determined in criminal court are Hungarian. Making the girl Gitta, a citizen of our country, and under our jurisdiction. For the moment, she's under my jurisdiction. That's right. Your Honor, you have the responsibility to do what's right for Gitta. Mr. Grazer, don't tell me what my job is. Marshal, if he opens his mouth,even for a hiccup, I want you to take him away. Then forget it, Your Honor. We don't want custody. Um, can I talk to you for a minute? Okay. Yes, we did come here to adopt Gitta because we love her. But the fact is, I know that we can't beat the legal system. So, I am appealing to you to give Gitta to a real family. Or even back to her real mother. Not some governmental agency. Please, just give her to someone who will love her. That's it. You know, I have, uh,I have a pretty simple job here. I've been given one directive by the State of New York, and Mrs. Johnson, you'll be happy to know that that is to act in the best interest of the child. Dr. and Mrs. Johnson risked their lives for Gitta, who was a stranger to them when this began. Without any guarantee that they would ever be taking her home. Now if that isn't acting in the best interest of a child, if that isn't being a good mother, then... then I don't know what is. I'm awarding full and immediate custody of Gitta to the Johnsons. Oh, my God. Any objections to that? Your Honor, as I stated in my opening... Your Honor, I will notify the consular office of your decision along with my concluding recommendation. And now that the court has ruled, I'd like to read this letter. Although I know it has no legal relevance. I feel that it's important for the record. Dear, Mr. Judge, I no longer stay in America, it is my want and wish that may daughter Gitta go home with the Johnson family, signed Janka Madyar. This hearing is adjourned. Um, uh... When can we get her, Your Honor? Well, as soon as you can pick her up. Go get her, Mom. Dear family and friends, it's been quite a year at the Johnson house. Evan joined Cub Scouts, Steve's practice is going well, and I'm up to my eyeballs as usual at the boutique. But the big news is, and believe me, it's pretty big news. We have a precious little girl named Gitta. Our attorney in New York has a saying, "Child birth is an act of nature but adoption is an act of God." I guess you could say we're believers. and we have a miracle to prove it. Greetings to all of you, and love, from the Johnson family.
