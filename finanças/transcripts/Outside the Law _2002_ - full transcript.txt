You're shredding your napkin. This is the last time, Julie. The last job. After today, mira, we're gone. - We're really going to do this, aren't we? - Of course. I love you. I want to marry you. I even have the poem to read at the church. -As many as you want. - Four. - And a dog. I love dogs. - The happy couple. - Hey, Crowley. - What you got? - Be nice. "She walks in beauty, like the night "Of cloudless climes and starry skies" Can I have that back, please? You're really going to marry this guy? - I am. - She is. You'd better believe it. They're moving. Come on. The bodyguards are ours. They get out of the car, we get in. We'll have Delgado in Miami before the cartel even knows what hit them. Luis. No surprises, right? Your guys checked all the rooftops and the windows? Yeah, that's fine. Guaranteed. The street's clean. Let's keep it that way. We'll pick you up on the way out. You can sit with Delgado and keep him company. Screw you. See you in a few. -Brian. Four kids, a dog, and a house with a white picket fence. Got it? I love you. Brian. No! No! Take this. It's all in here. Okay? You're coming with me, Brian. - Julie. - No. - Julie. - No. - I'm dying. - No. You're coming with me. Go! Go! Good morning, Miami. At 10 past the hour, you're listening to WEOD Talk Radio, the voice of Miami. Another beautiful day in paradise. Highs expected to climb into the 90s by this afternoon. Why not get out there and enjoy yourself? - Just don't forget your radio. Dawson. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. Julie. Everyone's dead. Where are you? I said everyone is dead, Dick. Let me bring you in. I'll call you back. Julie Cosgrove's alive. My God. Miami, we want to hear from you. What do you have to say? This is your station, WEOD Talk Radio, the voice of Miami. Maria, you're the first caller. Go ahead. One. Two. Three. Four. Figures. You fish? Only off-shore. Me, too. What do you use? A Drummond 703 and a fly reel. I prefer the Schumacher. Here, I'll show you the car. You dumb ass, nobody uses a fly reel off-shore. Take it easy. Back off! Put that gun down. Drop it, right now! Put it down! Kick that gun! You get out of the car! Drop that gun! Put it down! Get over with the other moron! All of you together. On the ground. Now! Now! Open the door, right now. -Two. Get a better job. Something they can be proud of. It's all in here. It's all in here. She's just had it. If she was going for the killer, she'd have stayed in Cartegena. But now she's gonna run. Run as far as she can. How the hell did this happen, Matt? I mean, what went wrong out there? Do you have any idea how difficult it's gonna be to find her now? We'll find her. The optimist. But we have to find her. I want to know what she saw in Colombia, what she heard. She's cleaned out all of her bank accounts. So, she's got nothing but cash. - Nothing to trace. - Right. By now, she's cut her hair, dyed it, and probably got new clothes. You could pick her up, take her home, and not know who you were screwing. Morning. In other news, crop damage to local farmers throughout Central Florida from recent excessive winds and storm damage may have a devastating effect on the local economy. Hey! Hi. How's it run? Better than it looks. Just rebuilt the engine myself. -$1,500. But if you take the dog, I'll make you a deal. - Don't want the dog. - Me, neither. Used to be my old lady's. She split for Key West. Left me the phone bill and the damn dog. He probably misses her. Not for long. I'm taking him to the pound. - Let me help you with that. - Thank you. What's the hurry? I'm late for dinner at the White House. The President can wait. - That's not a good idea. - It feels good to me. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! You're smarter than you look. I guess it's just you and me, dog. You never heard of a doggie bag? Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. -Just me. This good? We've got a man posted on every road leading out of town. Find every car rented by a woman, every car stolen by anyone, and each truck driver who picked up a hitchhiker. - It'll take a lot of manpower. - I don't care what it takes. Just find her. -I have the dog in the car. Really? Aw. He's adorable. You could have brought him in. We love dogs. I'll tell him next time. -Please. I want to buy that table a round over there. -You've been drinking all day. You leave here loaded and get stopped, our license gets yanked. I'll give you something to yank, baby. Keep your hands off her! Look. It's the boyfriend coming to the rescue. Stop it! Leave him alone! That's enough. -Miss Manners. When someone asks you to leave, you're supposed to go. Okay, Miss Manners. I've got an order for you. Hey! Um, I have to thank you. It's okay. Hi! Where did you learn that stuff? I grew up with six brothers. Where are you guys heading? I don't know. You could stay here a couple of days if you want. I mean, I have a spare room. I would love the chance to return the favor. - Okay. - Great. Hey, babe. Come here. Hi. Kurt and some of the sleazebags that work for you were here all day again. Drunk and stupid. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Kurt beat Rick up. If that woman didn't step in, it could have been real bad. - I don't want them in my restaurant again. - Absolutely not. -He'll be okay. -No, I still have to change. I'll meet you at your house. Rita can show you where your room is. Make yourself at home. -Thanks. Hey! Hi. You're the woman that beat the crap out of Kurt? - He's a tough guy. - He was drunk. -He might bite. I just wanted to apologize for him, that's all. Forget about it. It was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you around. Classified faxes Brian sent to the CIA station chief in Bogota. Encrypted and bounced off a German satellite link so that our own guys wouldn't even pick them up. We are getting ripped off in Colombia. Millions of dollars of interdiction equipment and supplies. Most of which are being sold to drug dealers. Brian uncovered a black-market operation. Huge. He had detailed invoices, shipment schedules, warehouse locations. You think he figured out who was behind it? It has to be one of us. Hi. -Hey. How many is that, Kurt? That's very interesting. My father always said, "It's not who votes, but who's counting." We know who counts here. Ramon, it's good to see you. It's good to see you, Michael It's a beautiful house you have here. Make yourself at home. - Another drink, sir? - Thanks. People don't know what's good for them. And people generally get the government they deserve. I didn't always think that, but now I think it's true. You know, I don't think that's true. It's a party, babe. Don't talk politics. What else is there but politics? - Cheers. - Cheers. How many kids? Four kids, a dog, and a house with a white picket fence. - I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. So, there you are. I've been here all night. I've been putting together a deal. You didn't have to ignore me. Hey. Business before pleasure. But now, the office is closed. Come on, babe. It's been a long day. No. Don't tell me no. No, Michael. I've had it. I'm sick and tired of this. Sick and tired of what? What have you been waiting here all this time for? Come here, baby. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. I'm not your whore, Michael. -I said, "I'm not your whore." No? Then why don't you get out? I'm through with you. Get out. Go on. She's offended. - You pathetic little whore. - You bastard. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. I told you to get out. Now get out of here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Michael. -I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Be right back. - Morning. - Good morning. -Not yet. How are you feeling? Fine. You didn't have to get involved. Sorry. Next time, I'll stay out of your way. Tell Annie I said thanks. Yeah. Sure. Ma'am, is there a Rick Mitchell here? - He's right there. - Thank you. Rick Mitchell? Yeah. Is there a place we can talk? It's about your sister. What about my sister? I'm very sorry, but a fisherman found her earlier today. -She drowned. No. I'll need you to come down and identify the body. She was at Michael Peyton's last night. It seems she left his house around 2:00 a.m. There are witnesses to confirm that. Who Take it easy there, Mr. Mitchell. We're doing our job. Yeah. You're doing your job. Let's go, son. - I'll go with you. - No, stay here. Hop in the back there, son. Damn keys! Come on. I'll give you a ride. Rick and Annie's parents died when Annie was in college. Annie was left to raise Rick. She was his best friend. He'd have done anything for her. - How long have you two been together? - Almost three years. We're planning on getting married, having kids, you know, the normal stuff. I just found out that I'm pregnant. I haven't even told Rick yet. Why doesn't he like Peyton? 'Cause Peyton's a jerk. His father left him a fortune. He's been just finding ways to blow through it. Yeah. Plus, Rick hated the way he treated Annie. What do you mean? He treated her like a possession. It's like... He slapped her a couple of times. He just was really possessive. But Annie was lonely... and sometimes Michael could be a lot of fun. It was weird, the less she wanted him, the more he had to have her. What are you talking about? - She had bruises all over her face.- Someone beat her then threw her off a boat. The surf could've done that. - The surf, right! - Sure, I've seen it. What are you doing here? We did find her car parked at the beach. This is all a bunch of crap! Rick. This is all just a cover-up to protect Michael Peyton. This is an active investigation. The medical examiner will rule on the cause of death. Let's go, Rick. Please. That bastard's not gonna get away with this. None of you are. - When does the ME issue his report? Are you related to the deceased? No. -Just visiting. What's your involvement in this case? None, I just asked a question. Yeah. You have a good day now. We might have something. It's a thin maybe, but it might be real. - You get on this one yourself. - I'm on it. - I wish you could stay. - Yeah. Me, too. I could put you to work. We'll be opening again soon. Thanks. But I need to get going. I got a lot of stuff to deal with. A guy, right? And other things. Where are you headed? North. It can get pretty cold up there. I can't believe she's gone. I don't know what we're gonna do now. You keep going. You live well. You do something worthwhile. Take good care of that baby. - I haven't even told him yet. - I think he could use it now. - Bye. - Good luck, Rita. What? Don't give me that look. We've got our own problems, dog. You know they're looking for us. If we stay here and help, they might catch us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's definitely her, man. Different hair, but the eyes are the same. Now... According to your bill of sale... Amelia Earhart bought your truck. Does that strike you as sort of strange? No. Why? Amelia Earhart was flying around the world... when she went off the map in 1937. So... you might be the first guy to have seen her in over 60 years. Wow, far out. -No. Any idea where she was headed? No. You can get almost anywhere from here. 1937? She still looks pretty good. I'll bet. - Thank you. - No problem. Sorry. Rita told me you were here. - 'Cause you're going after Peyton. -I think you need a hand. Nobody asked you. What's your plan, you gonna wing it? What happens to Rita if you get killed? Rita's pregnant. Michael Peyton is a lowlife murderer. He does what he wants to whoever he wants. He's got it all wired. You can't even touch him in this town. Nobody's untouchable. I won't let him get away with this. You say that Peyton's a lowlife? You prove it. -I know it. Then you prove that, too. Why are you doing this? Because I know men like Peyton. I also know what it feels like to lose someone you love. Get down! How many people in this town have automatic weapons? It's Florida. Who knows? Ooh. Look at that. You folks playing with guns out here? Somebody sprayed the house. We saw the car. You get the plates? It was too far. That's too bad. 'Cause that ain't much to go on. Not that you care, right? You've got an awful lot to say, son. I don't know what's going on around here, but if I were you, I'd be careful not to do anything stupid right about now. - Thanks for the advice. - To protect and serve, ma'am. Ma'am? I thought you were just passing through town. Take care. - I'm starting to not really like that guy. Yeah, I don't think he's exactly dying to have your baby, either. -Now we do our homework. All right, we put out a new APB on Cosgrove and the truck. Different name, different bio. This time she's a fugitive, suspected of running guns for the IRA. She's heading North. She's gonna go to Canada, maybe Alaska. -She won't stay in the States. She knows that I know that she hates cold, so she is gonna go there anyway. Great. We catch her at the border. I'll alert the guys on the other side. A lot of good that's gonna do. The plates you wanted run, they're for a truck registered to a James McBride down in Delray Beach. Have you seen that truck in town? Why? The feds are looking for it, too. It came over the wire last night. The feds No. Some agency in Miami. Do you want me to get a hold of them? No. Don't worry about it. I'll call them. Who's the two other guys? I've never seen them before. But whatever's on that laptop must be real interesting. Why does he look so familiar? Hello. Look who's coming for lunch. Surprise, surprise. Let's go, Dr. Osmond. Leave the ladies. We have work to do. 1:15 and they're leaving the girls here alone? Maybe they've taken a vow of celibacy. Yeah, that's probably it. Cargo's from mainland China. It's a porcelain company. You read Chinese? Enough to order takeout. Thanks. Generous donation to the inspector's pension fund, no doubt. Let's go take a look. Open it. German. What... What are you doing? Go on. Go on. Get them up! Get your hands up! What the hell's going on? I thought you had this covered. - I'll take care of it. - You better take care of it. All right? Don't blow this, brother. Come here! It was that woman from the restaurant and the Mitchell kid. They were hiding in the truck. Did they look in the crates? No. I was only gone for a second. I'm not paying you to be gone. Sorry, man, I'm not... It won't happen again. It better not. Now get out of here. Get out of my face! Dick, you're wrong. A cop in Talavera County ran the plates on Cosgrove's truck. - She's still in Florida. - Or she dumped the truck. -I'm working on it. If they've got her, tell them to violate every civil right in the books to keep her. If we lose her, we're done. Okay. - Look who made the paper. - Peyton's friend. His name is Ramon Gallegos. "Unknown to authorities until recently "Gallegos appears to be poised to take control of the South Florida mob." You weren't kidding about the big leagues. No, I wasn't. What's this guy doing with Peyton? United General Chemical, main gate. They're on their way in. Call for you. Someone named McKenzie. It's about that truck. - It's the third time he called. I don't need a government suit crawling up my butt about nothing. It doesn't sound like nothing. Paulson, I will call him back. Doc Osmond, come on in. Hey, there. -Yeah. You guys go ahead down, we'll meet at the end of the hall. - Happy birthday, baby! - Who... Who are you? I'm your birthday present from all the guys in marketing. Marketing? I'm a Unitarian minister from Iowa. -709. I'm supposed to be in 609. Sorry for the mistake, Father. It's Bill. Bill Poole. I'm not married. Bill, that's really sweet of you, but you'd hate yourself in the morning. Kurt! Nice to see you again. How did you get it? I had a brief encounter with... Harry Osmond, chemist. Mob chemist. I'm betting that this has answers to a lot of questions. Except I don't even know how to turn it on. Let me give it a shot. -I can turn it on. It's probably gonna have a security system. I bet I can get into it, but it's gonna take some time. So there is something you can't do. She is human. What's wrong with you? Has this become some kind of a joke? This woman, whoever she is... tails this idiot and steals his computer with all our information. - She's still breathing! - Relax. She can't get into my computer. Besides, I have everything here in my brain. What brain is that, Romeo? The one you have tucked in your pants? The only reason I'm here is I committed to the distributors. I gave them my word. And you, you punk! You better deliver it as promised. Later. - Froman, the guy from Miami... - Not now, Paulson. You must be the guy who phoned about the truck. About a hundred times. You know, if I didn't know any better... I'd say you were avoiding me. I was gonna call you first thing this morning. Yeah. You came all the way up here from Miami, must be serious. What's up? Chasing a suspect in a terrorist bombing. You get a look at the driver? You know, I never did speak to that driver. You see, the truck was parked near a crime scene. Bank robbery. For a while we thought it might have been the perp's truck. It wasn't. That's about it. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You thought the truck might be involved in a bank robbery and you never questioned the driver? - No, but... - I'd say that's pretty damn lazy. -The name's McKenzie. Who is it you said you work for? I didn't. I'm with the federal government. Well, I'm not. I don't need no damn suit coming here telling me... How to totally screw up your career? Listen... does your chief know about your drinking problem? Or about the Cuban mistress you keep down in Talavera? Does he know about the Mercedes given to you by a Mr. Jorge De Silva, second-in-command of the Cali cartel organization in South Florida? Look, we caught the guys in the getaway car with the cash, so there was no reason to talk to her. We sent out an APB on her four days ago. - It never hit my desk. - Yes, it did. Where is she? Look, I haven't got a clue. But you will be the first to know if we spot her. I'd appreciate that. Major attitude. What's his problem? He works for the government. Dick, it's Matt. You'd better get up here. Things are gettin' warm. You need to get some sleep. You've been up all night. Ready? We're going to get supplies so we can open tomorrow. Do you need anything? No, I'm fine. Okay. -I'm okay. You're not. You've got that look again. What look? The sad one. It always surprises me when I see it, because you seem so strong. I'm not trying to be nosey, but what happened to you? Okay, I am being nosey. The man I loved was killed. -No. I'm so sorry. That's why you're on the road, running away? Sort of. Part of me just wants to forget everything. Part of me just doesn't know what I want anymore. All right? Good afternoon. I'm here to see Mr. Peyton. There's nobody here by that name. I know I have the right address. I'd like to see Mr. Peyton. Well what makes you think Mr. Peyton wants to see you? Take me to Peyton. What are you, a comedian? You're a funny guy, you know that. Why don't you take a walk? Come on, get out of here. I wanna introduce you to Mr. Cho Sung. I see your men have already met him. - How did you do it? - Osmond is a chemist. I started with the periodic table. - Of course. - But that got me nowhere. Then I tried an algorithm of his name combined with the first four letters... Just tell me. What did you find? Peyton's name on a big, fat file. Watch this. County sheriff. - Yeah, Detective Froman, please. -Matt McKenzie. One moment, please. I'm sorry. Detective Froman isn't in right now. When do you expect him in? I'm not sure. Call back later. All right, thank you. See what I mean? Our detective's not real talkative. We'll have to do something about that. This is a cookbook. What is he cooking? Designer drugs. These are the formulas. Where did you say you worked again? Whatever he's making, he's making lots of it. Here we go. This is the place where they're starting from. They pass every 12 minutes. Every 30 seconds, there's a guard on foot patrol. Shouldn't we be doing this at night? They expect it at night. No one breaks in at lunchtime. How can you eat that crap? The protein's good for you. Keeps you healthy. It's gross, man. It gives me gas. -It gives me gas, man. Why don't you eat regular food? Like that? I don't eat that. Okay, people, let's take another break. If you breathe too much of this stuff, you might want to take it home. Osmond's keeping production right on schedule. The yield is higher than we thought. Even with worldwide distribution, our supply will last us at least four years. In the first months, we'll flood the market. Then make it scarce, the price'll balloon. You've thought of everything, haven't you? We shouldn't be here long unprotected. Even breathing it will get you hooked. Shall we? You were right. Exactly 12 minutes. Let's get out of here. -Hydroxylindeldrine. Dopers call it Devil's Breath. It originated in Berlin a year ago. This makes crack look like talcum powder. Users get addicted to it right away. - Must be nice for business. - And bad for the client. You use it long enough, it'll rot your liver. If you keep using it, it could make you go blind. Nice. The UN and Interpol jumped all over it. They thought they had it contained. Peyton's got every cop in this town in his pocket. We could call the DEA or maybe the FBI. I can't. Why? I used to work for them once. I thought you might be someone like that. I was. Now they're after me. So... you want to give up on Peyton? Do you? I can't. Then neither will I. We're gonna need a few things. -Blasting caps... a dozen sticks of dynamite, a soldering iron, tool kit, digital timer... Is that all? One day I'd just like to get myself a cheeseburger, French fries, and a chocolate milk shake. She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes Thus mellow'd to that tender light Which heaven to gaudy day denies One shade the more, one ray the less Had half impair'd the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress Or softly lightens o'er her face Where thoughts serenely sweet express How pure, how dear. 14 July, missing from Santos: 200 rifles, 10,000 rounds. 3 August, Black Hawk lost. Worried for Julie. 16 August, threats from inside. Julie? Hey, relax. It's just a cheeseburger. You surprised me. I won't do it again. You've been crying. Yeah. Don't tell anyone. Is there anything I can do? No. Thank you. You know, Rita makes me talk about it. Things that are bothering me. You're lucky. Yeah. It's hard to be alone. But at least there's hope. How would you know? I know that you've helped us out. You came here and you made my fight your own. Maybe there's hope for everyone. You remind me of someone. Someone good? Someone I loved. Thanks. Thanks for the cheeseburger. Froman, my man. You are tougher to find than a needle in a haystack, you know that? I'd like you to meet my associate, Mr. Dawson. We have a few questions. Look, I don't know anything. Hey! -Screw you. No, I think it's going to be the other way around. You've done this before. A couple of times. Here's the rest of it. I can get more if you want. -A buddy of mine. He's in the, construction business. What'd you tell him? He's a good friend. Doesn't ask questions. Don't worry, it fell off a truck. It's untraceable. You're getting pretty good at this. I also downloaded the floor plan of Peyton's warehouse. -Real estate web site. The place is for sale if you wanna buy it. - We just want to get into it. - And get back out again. What are we gonna name her? You mean, what are we gonna name him? -Well, if it's a girl... Annie. I'm scared. -Of what might happen to you. It'll be okay. - You don't know that. - No, I don't. I don't. I'm scared, too. Of what? Of what I'll become if I don't do it. Now it's every six minutes. And they've doubled the walking guards. It's still a regular pattern. We're fine. Kurt this is Don. Ross is down. All units! All units! This is Lewis. West perimeter guard is down. Let's go! Let's go! Spread out. Something's up, let's go. -Nothing. -Excuse me. Drop it! Get over there, go on. There's 100 pounds of dynamite ready to go off. Don't screw with me! Let's go. Move! Let's go. - He can go. - No way. You can't help me. Get out of here. It's my fight. No, it's Rita. The baby. Go. Now. There's a bomb gonna go off any minute. Does that matter to you? I didn't think so. -Hey! Hey! Stay down. Go that way. Where do you think you're going? There are bombs set to go off any minute. Bombs. Nice try... but I'm not buying. I'm not selling. Have your boy go take a look. -No one important. You must be. You've got a lot of government people looking for you. Back taxes. She's right. Bombs all over the place. Timer's got less than two minutes on it. They can't be disarmed. You stop it or I'll blow your brains out. -I'm getting out of here. Now it's your turn. Peyton! Come on, we need to get out of here. Come on. You haven't lost your touch, Julie. I was beginning to wonder. Took us a while to find you. That's far enough. We know what happened in Cartegena. Why you got hit. Brian should've told us. We could've protected him. Then you know who set us up. - Everyone's dead. I'm out of it. You're never out of the business. You bastard. Those were your guys in Cartagena. You set us up. I would've cut Brian in, but you know Brian. He trusted you. He loved you. I loved him, too. But business is business. Brian gave you the pages from his diary. I want them back. First, you let him go. Give me the papers. Hey! I wish you could stay. So do I. I'm worried about you. Going off by yourself, not knowing where. I'll know when I get there. I'll write. I'm gonna phone you on the 24th of July. If anyone asks, just say you don't remember me. We'll always remember you. So let's do it. He's gonna be surprised when she brings him back in an hour. Thanks. Thanks for everything.
