The children's parents, when asked how they felt-- Yes, I understand that. No, it hasn't been five months. It's only been four. Okay. Okay. Regardless, I just need some more time... to get the money. [Background rock music mixed with bar chatter] BARTENDER: There you go. Thank you. Hi. Can I check out here? Sure thing, honey. Here, try this one. Thank you. I'll be back in a moment. Mara? Yeah? I'm Pete Kyle. This is my partner, Dex. The pizza guys. Pizza guys. How do you know? Nine locations and counting. Good to meet you. Hey, we're really excited to see the property. Yeah, so am I. I'm sorry, honey, but your card was declined. Oh, I'm sorry. DEX: I don't want you embarrassing me on this trip now. PETE: What? DEX: You heard me. PETE: When do I embarrass you? DEX: Get in, old man. Jesus Christ. Excuse me. I drive 5 hours up here to march in the goddamn pride parade. So I'm, I'm Gene Donovan. Everyone just calls me Donovan. Ani LaBeau. LaBeau What is that? German. it's French. French for bitch, I guess. Hey, does this mean you're not going to sit on my lap on the way up there? [Mysterious score] MARA: All right, let's remember, the whole point of this field trip is to see if any of you want to buy this place. I've never seen it myself. So there won't be a tour. We'll get in, look around on our own and get out. Understand? DEX: What if we want to come back for a second look? MARA: You'll have to do it on your own. I'm flying home tomorrow so I can get back to my students and my classroom. [Mysterious music continues] PETE: Uh oh, that's not good. [Music ends as ominous ambience continues] MARA: I guess we walk from here. DONOVAN: Terrific. [Forest ambience] DEX: What's that? Um, my kids. Oh... They force the sub to text these over yesterday before my flight. PETE: Oh, my God. Cute. Damn. Yeah. Pete really wants kids, but uh...we can't decide which one of us should get pregnant. Oh, I'm just messing with you. PETE: Yeah, it's just, just a-- MARA: Oh! just a joke. You guys should really consider adoption. It's insane what some kids go through when they don't have someone to love them. Yeah... It sounds like you really care. MARA: Kids are my life. I'd do anything for them. [Mysterious music] Hey, you're the hotel water park lady, right? Nikki, yes. Nikki. And you're in from Minnesota? I manage a place just outside the Twin Cities, actually, but I'm trying to get back home to Wisconsin, do my own thing, you know? What do you do for your pizza? My pizza? If you want to give your tastebuds big surprise, serve them up a slice of Pete's Pizza pie. Okay. Real good. Real good. Fuck me. I knew you'd warm up. Fuck me. God damn it! [Ominous underscore] Woah-huh-hoh! [Music continues with clock ticking] Can you believe this? [Bass stinger] [Music fades into forest ambience] DEX: This place looks incredible, man. MARA: Okay, guys, we only have a couple of hours before I have to start getting you guys back, so I suggest that... [Horror stinger] DONOVAN: You'd suggest? So. I suggest that we all do our own thing so we can cover more ground. Uh, look around, take pictures, whatever you want. Meet back here, and we'll compare notes on the way back. Does that work with everyone? NIKKI: Back in 2 hours? MARA: Yeah, 2 hours. Yeah. [Ominous music] Oh, oh, oh. Woah! Oh, talk about a blast from the past. [Camera click] DONOVAN: Hey, have you done any research on this place? ANI: No, not really. You? DONOVAN: There has to be another entrance back here. Not much. Same land owner as far back as the county records go, but a handful different businesses in and out over time. So it's a weird history. Weird how? None of them lasted very long. And it's basically been empty for 56, the last 60 years. Before that, uh, not clear, not clear at all. Is that normal? No, no, it's not. There we go. When did you say this place closed down? [Camera click] Uh, five years ago, maybe more. I guess it was a resort or something. Five years? [Ominous music] It looks more like five days. You could open the doors on Monday and no one would know the difference. Pretty old, huh? Hmm. A century, I think. [Camera click] NIKKI: I'm surprised you don't know more about this place. All I know is that a lawyer called me up one day and said my father left it to me in his will. Not a moment too soon either. NIKKI: And he never told you about this place before? He never told me anything. I never met him. It was always just me and my mom. Hmm. Mmmm. NIKKI: So what does she say about all this? My mom? [Music ends] NIKKI: Yeah. Nothing. She passed away about eight years ago. NIKKI: Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. But sometimes I miss my family. PETE: God, we could do so much with this. We could grate that down to a beach over there. Swimming, water sports. Maybe even rent some kayaks, jet ski... bet we could offer a pontoon shuttle to the downtown water parks. You don't even care about any of that, do you? It's not like people are going to come here. Sure. Why would people go on vacation and do vacation stuff? "Pete and Dexter's Haunted Inn" Dexter's? Sounds better than Dex's. We don't even know if this is the place. No, man it has to be. Then what are we doing out here? Should be looking around inside. All right we need to come back here tonight. Just the two of us, then we can really look around. It took us over 2 hours to get here in the daylight. Pete, let's be done with pizza, man. PETE: I like pizza. No shit! a couple more years they're going to be calling you pudgy Pete the pizza guy. Hey. See what happens when your metabolism slows down. Okay, that's never going to happen, but if it did, that's why we need to get out of the pizza business. While we can still fit in the same bed. Look, between all of this and this and this, we make a fortune, C'mon! Look, who got all ambitious all of a sudden! Hey, you know. [Door creaks, footsteps] [Door slam] [Footsteps] DONOVAN: So how'd you hear about this? My father's lawyer. Castanelli? Yeah. Yeah, he tipped me off too. We've done a bunch of major deals together. Major deals. He's running point for me right now in a condo project on the Miracle Mile. Completely self-financed. Do you have any idea how much money something like that takes? Okay, we get it. You've got some money. Some money? Look, I don't give a shit. Okay? This might get you laid with the downtown bar skanks and the remax crowd, but I'm not impressed. I don't need a sugar daddy, Eugene. Jesus Christ. You got to fuckin attitude, don't you? Let me guess. Mommy and Daddy were too busy building a family real estate empire to come to your school plays, which broke your poor little heart. But now that your trust fund has finally come due you're going to go out there and show them what you can do all on your own. And they'll be so proud of you. They'll realize that you were worth their love all along. Right? Something like that. They were band concerts, not plays. Terrific. So what's your favorite instrument to blow? Hm. Fuck off, Grandpa. [Ominous music] MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Mara... Mara... [WOMAN CRYING] [Hinge creak] [Camera click] [Camera click] Cool. [Camera click] [Stinger] MARA: Hey. [Stinger as music ends] Fuck, Mara Shit! Do you sneak up on your kids like that? What's down there? I don't know. I think it's another wing. [FAINT BUZZING] I'm going to go check it out. I'm going to finish up over here and then I'll come join you. Okay. Keep an eye on the time. You got it. [Ominous rumble] [Footsteps] [Horror ambience] [Crying] [Horror piano] [Ominous music and wood creaks) [Crying continues] Hello? [Crying continues] [Crying] [CRYING GETS LOUDER] Hello? What are you doing here? [Stinger] Ahh! [Horror music ends] DONOVAN: Ani, Ani! Would you quit acting like a baby? PETE: What happened? How old was the girl? What? I don't know. Ok, but like a toddler or teenager. You serious right now? There is nothing there. Yes, there was. Come on! I saw her! Yeah, but why didn't I see her? She was right there. We believe you, sweetie. No, we don't, actually. What happened? Ani met a friend in the cellar. What does that mean? She saw something. Thought she saw something. So what? Dex... Okay. What do you think? Oh, Jesus Christ, Dex. I didn't say that. Okay? Okay, she saw it. He didn't. What else could that be but a ghost? How about a fucking hallucination? Do you really not know about this place? Know what? The history. This is considered one of the most haunted spots in the Midwest. The whole country even! Maybe, this might not even be the place. Dex is a paranormal enthusiast. In case you hadn't guessed, this is why we are here. Terrific. Okay, but I'm here to make money. So if the gay Ghostbusters are done with their campfire tales? Can you please get back to business? Excuse me? Oh, Sorry, Are you uh.. you guys not on the same team? So what if we are? Okay, take it easy. What's your problem? No problem. I just believe that sex should be between a man and a woman. Or, a man and several women if he's up to it. Oh, well that is great news for all the ladies here. Honestly, Ha! How do you guys even do that? Oh, so you're curious, huh? I had a hunch. Fuck you, pizza boy. Okay, let's all just calm down. It's getting close to dark anyway. I know Nikki has a flight to catch, and I'm sure she's not the only one. Where's Nikki? [Ominous music] [Camera click] [Camera click] [Camera click] [Camera click] [Camera click] [Music picks up] [NIKKI LAUGHS] [Music quiets] [Camera click] [Bass stinger] [Music continues] [Camera click] [Camera click] [Metallic creaks] NIKKI: Guys? It's not funny. [Camera click stinger] [Camera click stinger] [Dissonant string notes] [Camera click stinger] [NIKKI SCREAMS] [Choking sounds] Nikki! ANI: Nikki! Nikki! PETE: Nikki! Why don't we spread out, so we can look around. By ourselves? I'll go with you. Ew! Come on Ani. We'll go together. So maybe you want to come with me, then maybe ask me some of those questions you have.. I think I'll be fine on my own. Thanks. 20 minutes. Okay. We really need to leave soon. So back up front in 20. All right. Hang on. DONOVAN: Hang on, hang on. What? How soon are you going to be ready to entertain offers? How soon can you get me one? Are you in a hurry? Frankly, yes. I just want to get this done. Settle my debts and get back to my kids. Okay. What debts? Student loans, credit card debts, my mom's medical bills, you name it. This place is my last chance to stitch my life back together. All right, so you're flying back to California in the morning, right? First thing. Okay. So I'll have an offer waiting for you by the time you land. Now accept it by the end of business tomorrow. I'll do the whole thing in cash. We can wrap this up by the end of the week. Right? That sounds good. [Ominous music crescendos] DEX: Nikki... Nikki! Nikki! Jesus. Nikki. Nikki. Come on! Nikki! Nikki, we got to go. Nikki! Nikki, it's time! Nikki! Nikki! ANI: Come on Nikki, we gotta go! No, don't go that way. What? Is that what you saw it? come on. Nikki! Alfred? No. Hang on! Hey hey hang the Fuck on! All right. I'm trying to find a better spot. Hold on. Hold on. Fuck! Jesus Christ, Al-Alfred. Al... Alfred... Fuckin' A! God Damn it. Alfred. Hold on. Can you hear me? Alfred? Alfred, she literally has no idea what she's sitting on here. Al- Alfred. Alfred. Jesus Christ. come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Ah, haha! Ok, which way? Dex, I really don't wanna go back in there, okay? Please, just show me. ANI: please. In there? Thank you. It's real. Dex? Fuck! What the fuck? Fuck! oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah! Come on! Come on, Fucker! Open the fuckin' door, Come on. Hey. Hey. Come on. Open up! Come on! Fuck you. Hey, hey, hey. Fuck me, Come on! God! Damn it, fucker.! Come on, fucker. God Damn it, Fuck you! Fuckin' door! Damn it. Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey! Come on, quit fucking around. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, fuck. Nikki NIkki Help us! Help us! (eerie music) Pete! I was just going to find you guys. You're not going to believe what we just found. Wait! You have to see this. Oh! Holy shit. I thought you'd like this. This is it Pete! This is the place. I'm sorry, why is there a church in a hotel? Exactly. Exactly what? This wasn't always a hotel. 100 years ago, something like that. It was boarding school. So? Not just any boarding school. Her boarding school. Time to go. Any sign? Nothing. Shit. ok, I got to get you guys back. What about Nikki? Once we get somewhere, we get a signal. We'll call for help. you know, Pete and I can stay behind. No, we can't. Dex, it's not smart. We can come back later. No one's staying behind [crow caws] Where's your car? Where's your fucking car? This is where we left it, isn't it? What happened? What do you think happened? The car's gone. Nikkis gone. Do the fucking math. You think Nikki took the car? Why would Nikki steal the car? Same reason I would had I thought of it first. To get a jump on you idiots before you figure out this place is worth three times, what tweedle-dumb here is asking for. Oh, my God. Paranoid much? Then you explain it princess How would she even do that? Hey. Hey. Did you leave the keys? Did you leave the keys in the the fucking car. Who's going to steal a car in the middle of nowhere? Jesus Christ! Leave it to the goddamn teacher! Is it any wonder, kids today are such fucking morons? Ok, Settle down. Settle down? Yes, settle down. We can hike up to the main road. Really? Do you remember all the twists and turns and side rows it took to wind our way in here? It'd Take 3 hours to walk in the light. And that's if we knew where we're going, but we don't. And it's dark out. So good luck with that. Yeah, an P.S. There's wolves in these fucking woods. Wolves. Where are you going? Where do you think I'm going? There's walls, roof and beds back there. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. You keep hiking. I'll be sure to look for your mangled corpse in the morning. (macabre synth music) Who is her? What? You said her boarding school before. What does that mean? What are you guys talking about? Dex thinks this used to be a boarding school. No, it was a resort or something. Before that. Before that too. No, I'm talking way back when this place was first built. How do you know that? Have you ever heard of the headmistress? Like a school principal? There's an old legend about a boarding school somewhere here in central Wisconsin, but nobody knows exactly when or where it all happened. All what happened? The school was owned by a real estate tycoon and his twin sister, who supposedly was not quite right in the head. Anyways, she ran the school and by all accounts was kind and generous and did her best to protect the kids. Protect them from what? Well, whenever one of the girls caught the brother's eye. He would take them down to the cellar. Sometimes for days at a time and use them to satisfy his peculiar appetites. Jesus. So one day, legend has it the sister had had enough and decided to interfere in her brother's recreation. In a fury, he dragged her up to her sewing room in the attic, raped her and beat her to within an inch of her life. Are you making this up? So later that fall, the sister gave birth to her own brother's baby, which, despite how it was conceived, was all she'd ever wanted in the world. A baby to call her own. But then, in one final act of cruelty, the brother took the baby away and left, leaving her shattered and heartbroken and alone to run the school. That's the most horrible thing I've ever heard. It's not over. See, the sister became so consumed by bitterness and despair that she snapped and she became the student's worst nightmare. She let them go hungry and neglected their health. She made them live in their own filth. And for even the slightest misbehavior, she dragged them up to the sewing room to make sure they could never offend her again. If they said something. She sewed their mouths shut. If they took something, she stitched their fingers together, and if they even looked at her wrong, they never open their eyes again. Dex, enough. One by one, the children all died. And when the sister was finally all alone, she killed herself. But only, they say, so that she could continue to torture and torment the girls beyond the grave. And that's the legend of the Headmistress. Jesus, Dex. Nice bedtime story. Where's Donovan? Found some old blankets upstairs. Not exactly Bed, Bath and Beyond but they'll get us through the night and lights are catch as catch can. Many do not work, so everybody should grab one of the lanterns that Ani found earlier. Night, night. Don't let the headmistress bite. Ugh... DONOVAN: Look at this. Practically roommates. Don't tell me that's a coincidence. And here I was thinking that smell was something dead in the closet. Well, if those blankets don't do the trick, I'll come and warm you up. Wow. Congratulations. You've officially made freezing to death the more appealing option. Yeah. Sweet dreams, princess. Don't forget to close the door on your way out. Eugene. What century are we in? This is like queer I Love Lucy, but back when even the straight couples had to sleep in separate beds. What'd you say? Hey, Pudgy P you're not using the toilet, are you? What? You're not using the toilet, I hope. Just because it won't flush doesn't mean I can't pee. That's disgusting, dude. What did you do? I went outside like a man. I can't hear you. I said I went- Pete? Pete. Pete? Pete. Pete! Pete! Pete! Pete, Pete, Pete. Pete! Pete! Pete! What the fuck are you doing? Pete? You're really killing the mood, Pete. Pete. PETE: Dex? Pete? [Dex yells] PETE: Dex, are you down there? Where'd you go? Where did you go?! Come on man, you're not going to believe this. Come on! PETE: Slow down! PETE: Dex! What? Oh, my God. Get the fuck out of my room! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Ow! Help! Get off me! Get off! Help! ANI: Stop! Stop! Dex, slow down. I swear it was him. He's in this house. Who? The brother! I saw him! That means she's here too, Pete. Wait, wait. ANI: Stop! Do you hear that? ANI: Stop! ANI: Help! [Beads rattling] MARA: Hello? Hello? What do you want? PETE: Mara? Mara? MARA: What? Something happened to Ani. What happened? It was Donovan. What was Donovan? He attacked me. What? We heard her screaming, but by the time we got there, he was already gone. ANI: I couldn't get him off me. He was grabbing me. Pushing me down. DEX: You don't have to talk about it. Good. ANI: and then Dex and Pete were there and he was just gone. Are you all right? No. DEX: It's okay. We're not going anywhere. We need to find Donovan. ANI: Fuck Donovan! I just want to get the hell out of here. DEX: It's okay. It's going to be fine. Donovan might not have done this. Dex, stay with Ani. DEX: What? We're going to go find Donovan, and then we're all getting out of here. Fuck Donovan. DONOVAN: Hey! Hey! Hey! DONOVAN: What the fuck? DONOVAN: What the fuck is that? [Stabbing noises] [Donovan shouting] (weird eating sounds) Gene, it's Pete. We got to talk. Come on out. Donovan. Donovan? MARA: Donovan! PETE: Donovan? CHILDREN: Help us! CHILDREN: Help us! CHILDREN: Help us! CHILDREN: Help us! CHILDREN: Help us! Help us! CHILDREN: Help. CHILDREN: Help us! Help us! CHILDREN: Please help us. MARA: What do you want? What do you want?! What do you want from me?! You're what? Look. Pete cannot be wandering around this place, okay? None of us should. You can't leave me here. I'm not. But I have to get the others. ANI: Dex! Ani, just go. Get to the bridge, okay? Get as far from this place as you can. I'm going to meet you there. I promise. Come with me, please! Ani, I'm not leaving Pete. Please, just go, okay? Just go! ANI: Dex, please! DEX: Ani, go. Just go! ANI: Dex... DEX: Go. ANI: Dex! (she sniffles) Pete. Mara. Anything? What's going on here? What do you mean? Nikki didn't steal the car and leave us here. These haven't been just innocent bumps in the night. Something's wrong here, Mara. What do you know that we don't? (creepy ambience) (odd fire sound) (creepy piano) PETE: Mara... This place didn't just close down, okay? Something happened. What do you mean? 35 years ago, when this was Captain Kid Seaside Resort, there were three incidents. Eight people died here in two years. All of them violent, all of them horrible. None of them explained Jesus. 25 years after that, someone else tried to open it. The Lake Front Inn. But that only lasted six months. Five guests died one night. A man brutally murdered his entire family and then he killed himself. He took the scissors and he slit his own throat. PETE: Oh, my God. That was five years ago. They shut it down. And this place has been empty ever since. You knew about all this. You knew and you didn't tell us? I didn't know about the school. I didn't know about the children. Oh, so you only knew about the 13 unexplained murders? Is that what you're trying to say? Only 13, not the rest? MARA: Pete! Are you fucking insane? I had to pay my debts. I owe so much. No one would buy this place if they knew. You think?! MARA: I never thought- God dammit, Mara. I didn't have a choice! Yes, you did. You had a choice. You made a choice. Pete. We have to get out of here now. MARA: I am so sorry. Wait... It is. Cigarette smoke. He must have come through here. PETE: Donovan! We gotta go! [Mara gasps] Pete. PETE: He's not in here! Pete. Oh, Jesus. (creepy ambience) (snap sound, followed by door squeaking) [Mara gasps] Holy shit. (droning music) PETE: Dex! DEX: Pete. Pete! You all right? Did you find Donovan? He's dead. What? You were right, Dex. PETE: About this place. PETE: It's Charlotte and Nathaniel. What? Where's Ani? She's out already. What did you say? Okay, let's go. Stop. What did you just say? (chanting) (weird, religious ambience) (screeching) (horror music) (builds in intensity) (thump!) [Ani screams] (eerie piano) Why did you say Nathaniel? Because I saw him. He's here! Who? Nathaniel! Who's Nathaniel? The brother from the legend. The Headmistress and the Brother. Charlotte and Nathaniel Mallory. They're the ones doing this! Mallory. DEX: They killed Donovan. Probably Nikki. That's the name. DEX: What name? Nathaniel Mallory That's the name of the man who left me this inn. What? My mother was the baby. My mother was the baby he took from her. That he stole from her. But now she's dead. And I'm all that's left. Mara, what are you saying? It wasn't my father who left me this place. It was my grandfather. And that means the Headmistress. Is my grandmother, Mara. PETE: Mara. We have to find a way out of here. (eerie piano) (footsteps) (creepy violin) DEX: Come on, come on, come on. Whoa, back, back. Whoa, back, back, back. (tense music) DEX: What is this? Jesus. MARA: Pete! Dex! Come on, come on! PETE: Oh, my God. DEX: What the fuck is that? That's the sewing room. MARA: That's where she took the children. PETE: We got to go. (tense music again) Whoa! PETE: Mara! We have to get out! Are you kidding me! Come on! They won't let us. DEX: Pete! Pete. It won't open. God dammit! DEX: No. No! Are you kidding me? DEX: Pete? Ani? DEX: Pete? Come on! DEX: Come on! (tense music, wood creaking) (music intensity builds) Oh god. No. DEX: God dammit. We're trapped, man! Ani? She's gone. No. Come on! DEX: God! DEX: Have you ever heard of the headmistress? ANI: Dex thinks this used to be a boarding school. PETE: What do you know that we don't? NIKKI: I'm surprised you don't know more about this place. MARA: She passed away about eight years ago. DEX: Her own brother's baby. MARA: What did you just say? DEX: The school was owned by a real-estate tycoon DEX: and his twin sister. PETE: It's Charlotte and Nathaniel. MARA: I didn't know about the school. MARA: I didn't know about the children. DEX: and she became the student's worst nightmare. PETE: You had a choice. PETE: You made a choice. DEX: One by one, the children all died. DEX: and that means the Headmistress. MARA: Is my grandmother. Mara, we have to find a way out. The children. Yeah. They're going to kill us. Let's go. No, they're not doing this. They won't let us leave because they need my help. Mara, please. Don't you see? All these years trapped and suffering? What? Because he took the baby away. Because he took my mother away. And now they're condemned to be here. Because we're not. Because I'm not. Mara. All she wants is her family back. Mara, please. I have to help them. I owe it to them. No, you don't. Just go. They won't stop you anymore. Mara, what are you doing? Mara, where are you going? I have to pay my debts. DEX: Mara! God, come on! PETE: Try the door! DEX: Pete, I'm telling you, it's locked. [Door unlocking] DEX: Are you fucking kidding me? PETE: I told you! (sinister music) (mix of gothic chants and music) (music continues, wood creaks) (thump, music becomes snake like) (macabre music continues) (music ebbs, wood creaks) (music continues) (Mara is whispered) (music becomes darker) (music quiets) (piano starts) (droning music) (cinematic hit) (music builds, gothic, eerie) (sound continues) (shuttering sound) (hard footsteps) (intensity builds) (ramps up off the charts) [Mara screaming] [Mara screaming] [Mara screaming] (screams echo with nature sounds) (breathing sounds) You still want to buy this place? Fuck, no. I'm done with ghosts. Let's go home and keep eating pizzas until we're a couple fat old fucking queens. Come on.
