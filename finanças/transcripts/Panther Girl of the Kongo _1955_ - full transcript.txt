(regal music) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (lion roars) (gentle music) I found a lion. We'll go up the trail a little farther and cut into the jungle. Yes, Bwana lady. (speaking in a foreign language) (rustling in brush) (ominous music) There's a big animal in there, maybe the lion. Set up the camera here, quick. Bwana lady Bwana lady (speaking in a foreign language) (camera rolling) Tembo! Tembo. Tembo, come back. A gun bearer must never leave his Bwana, you know that. We know chief Danka, but me not run from lion or elephant. This, this is not animal, like something we never see. Maybe spirit devil. Tembo, it wasn't a spirit. Maybe there's others. Me not want to go in jungle again. If you want them to go with you Bwana Evans, I'll give the order. Well I hate to force them to chief. That monster was a horrible looking thing. And I don't blame them for being afraid with only one rifle to protect them. But I can't give up 'till I get the pictures I need. If there are any more of these beasts around, I want to find out about them. I think I'll ask Larry Sanders to help me. Good, Bwana Sanders big hunter. He come with us, me go. I'll send for him right away. Can one of your men take a message to town for me? Of course. Thank you. I'll have him take my film in at the same time to be developed. (speaking in a foreign language) (orchestral music) Alright, tell her I'll be out day after tomorrow. Another hunting expedition, Sanders? You might call it that, Stanley. Only this time I won't be guiding a regular safari. A friend of mine, a girl named Jean Evans, wants me to help her hunt down some weird sort of monster. Sounds interesting. Where is she? Utanga district. Utanga? I didn't think Chief Danka liked to have white hunters in his district. Well Jean isn't exactly hunting you see, she's shooting motion pictures of wildlife in the international foundation. Anyway, she has a pretty good, in, with the Utanga tribe. Well she must have if old Danka... Say, is she the one they call the Panther Girl. Yeah, that's right. She earned the name and reputation about a year ago. She was trying to get some Utanga natives together for a picture safari. They wouldn't help. It seems about the time Jean arrived in their village a black panther started raiding it. Well, the natives blamed the raids on Jean's evil spirit. Which proves that a few years in a mission school just can't root out the superstitions of centuries. Yeah, it sure does. Old Chief Danka may speak pretty good English, but when you get right down to it, he still believes in voodoo and black magic, and all that sort of thing. Anyway, Jean was in a pretty rough spot, until one night a native visitor from the city here decided to out after dark. It was foolish, but he did it. He was bound and determined to cut some bamboo. (dramatic music) (monkeys screech) (panther roars) (screams) It's Koagno. Is he in the canyon? Yes he is but you can't go there, it's the killer panther. Yes black panther, black magic. Well now's a good chance to get rid of him. (gunshots) (groaning) After that, Jean brought the native back to the village and he recovered. The Utanga's gave her the Panther Girl name and pitched in to help her get her pictures. She sounds like a girl who can take care of herself. Hmm, she is. That's what makes me think this must be something special. I'm really anxious to find out just what kind of an animal it is that makes Jean Evans call for help. Waiter may I have a check please? (ominous music) Here's another one for ya to work on. You're sure the first one is dead? Yeah, one of our natives found pieces of claw on the trail. So we'll do another one. With what you know about chemistry, Morgan, you could write your own ticket to any country in the world. Even if they did run you out of the States. Perhaps, but chemists are not generally too well paid for research. And if I tried to sell my services to the kind of people who would really pay big money, I'd get in trouble with the authorities again. Besides, this diamond mine project of ours should bring us in all the money we'll ever need. Yeah, if and when we get the stuff mining out of the country. You know this government's pretty tough on people who go after diamonds on their own hook. Of course, but the authorities have no idea there are diamonds in this district. And there'll be no one around to bother us once we scare the natives out of the country. After our new specimen here has consumed these hormones, he'll be big and fierce enough to do the job. Alright, we'll start him growing. Then we'll go back to the mine and get out some more gravel. You better go to the Utanga village first. See if the natives are beginning to panic yet. Chief Danka don't like us hanging around there. I know, but as long as you convince them you're not hunting in his territory he won't bother you. Here. Let's head for the village. Bwana lady go river bank. Take pictures of alligator. Say, "when you come, you stay there." Alright Tembo, thank you. (dog barks) [Cass] Looks like we got visitors. Might be some hunter driving through. Gear's still in the Jeep. Well we better find out. It's bad enough having that girl hanging around. We don't want anybody else here. (knocks on door) Come in. Well hello, my names Larry Sanders. Staying here long? Well yeah, maybe. Why? 'Cause we don't want strangers hanging around here and neither do the natives. Well I wouldn't worry too much about the natives, I get along pretty well with them. Well you won't get along with us. We're working on a deal to get the natives to let us hunt in this territory. We don't want anybody butting in. Now just a minute. I happen to be here at the invitation of Ms. Evans. I intend to stay whether you like it or not. Think so? I know so. Well we're gonna make it so rough on you you you'll be glad to get out in one piece. Oh yeah. Just when is this lesson supposed to start? Right now. Jean. What's going on around here? These two characters wanna run me out of the district. You know them? They've been around here before. They say their names are Cass and Rand. They're supposedly looking for hunting territory. That's right. We wanna hunting territory of our own. What's wrong with that? I told you before, my people will never allow you to hunt in the Utanga. Yeah, well we thought that you might change your mind. I can promise you I won't. You heard Chief Danka he says no hunting, that's exactly what he means. You might as well be on your way right now. Thank you Chief Danka. Don't mention it. (speaking in a foreign language) Well that was a fine way to welcome you to the village. It's alright Jean, it wasn't really your fault. Was a surprise, though, to find men like that in the Utanga district. Any more of them around? No, the only other white man is a Doctor Morgan. He lives by himself in a bungalow over in the Rituri tribe's district. What's he doing there? Conducting some kind of chemical experiments. I paid him a visit once, but he was too absorbed in his work to be very friendly. (chuckles) Sounds like quite a character. Let's not worry about him, though. What's all this story about some kind of a jungle monster? Larry, this is fantastic, it's unbelievable. I think I got some good film of it though. I sent it to town to be developed. You can see for yourself when I get it back. Course between now and then, we may hunt down another one of them. Well that's fine, but you still haven't told me what the thing looks like. Well it sounds ridiculous, but it looks like a huge overgrown crawfish. A crawfish? Yes, a crawfish. (chuckles) You mean like a little lobster? Oh, Jean. You'll see. (dramatic music) [Cass] He's sure big enough. Yeah. Well your bug is growing up. But do you want to turn him lose with Sanders around. Yes, it may work to our advantage. If a Utanga or two were killed by the devil beast, in spite of the protection of Sanders and Ms. Evans, the tribe would be sure to panic. I see what you mean. They might even take their scare out on Sanders and the Panther Girl. Exactly. Now get some of your Rituri natives to carry the crate close to the Utanga village and then dump him out. You think we can still count on those Rituris? Certainly. As long a you keep giving them my special tonic, they'll do anything you tell them too. Yeah, but hey keep wanting more all the time. Naturally. The compound is habit-forming. The user requires increased doses. But I have plenty of it on hand. (crashing sound) (ominous music) Well, we won't be carrying that crate anywhere. We must get that creature closer to the Utanga Village. Have some of the Rituris drive it in that direction. Okay. Also tell 'em to stop anyone from shooting him. Give them enough of that tonic and they won't mind attacking white men if they have to. Right. (bottle clanks) You savvy? No let white man kill devil beast. We fix. Alright, get going. (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking in a foreign language) Ahh. Bwana. Bwana! Bwana! Bwana! Devil spirit come this way. It's alright Tembo, we'll take care of it. You and the other boys go back to the village. Yes, Bwana. (gunshots) (bullet ricochets) We must have hit it. Yeah, but we sure didn't stop it. Tell you what Jean, you follow it from here, slowly. I'll circle around and try to get in front of it. Right. Ahh! (screams) (regal music) (dramatic music) (yells) (screaming) Larry! Larry! (gun firing) Jean. I'm all right, except for the shoulder. You're lucky you still have a shoulder. Come on, Panther Girl, let's get back to the village and break out the first aid kit. We didn't see what happened, but Uturi said the girl didn't seem to be hurt very bad and Sanders took her back to the Utanga village. Yeah, Uturi said that Sanders wounded the claw monster, but he didn't know how bad. Well, we can grow another in less time than it would take a wounded one to recover, if it would recover. Okay, we'll go back to the mine. You'd better stay away from there for a while, there are too many people around now. How can we get any diamonds if we don't keep digging? Actual possession isn't important at the moment. We know where the diamonds are there and no one else does. There'll be plenty of time for digging after we frighten the Utangas and their white friends out of the district. Here. Take care of this. Then go to the Utanga village and find out what progress we're making. Sanders might take a shot at us. You know he won't. And you have a good chance to play on his sympathies now. Tell him you've heard rumors of these strange monsters and you're concerned about your own safety. All right. We'll give it a try. (birds squawking) Now what do you suppose they want? We'll soon find out. You two looking for another fight? Don't blow your cork, Sanders. We got other troubles. What's this story the natives are telling about some monster running around loose in the jungle? Anything to it? It's true enough. I have some pictures of one here. Are they really dangerous? They're dangerous. Miss Evans' pictures ought to prove that. We were just going to run them, you want to see for yourselves? Thanks, we'd like to. Come on in. Sit down. Part of this reel is film I took of other animals. We'll have to run through it first. All right, Jean. The lion scared everything else away. Now we're coming to the monsters. That's all. I'd say that's enough. What do you suppose they are? They look like gigantic crawfish, but I've never heard of such a thing. Neither have I. Looks too tough for me, I'm pulling out. We can find a hunting ground somewhere else. And you can say that again. What are you people gonna do? Well, the first thing tomorrow morning I'm gonna take that film into town and show it to the district commissioner. Once he sees it, he'll send us enough men to clean out the whole jungle. That makes sense. But I still don't like it. Thanks for tipping us off. Now I know why you asked them in. Sure. That film scares them away from here, it'll be good riddance. But just in case they don't scare easy, we'd better be ready for anything they might start. When that troop of constables get here, we'll really be washed up. Commissioner will never believe Sanders' story unless he sees those pictures. And Sanders isn't taking that film into town until tomorrow. That's right. So it'll still be in the girl's bungalow tonight. (suspenseful music) Take it easy. All we want is that reel of film. Get something to tie her up with. Get over against the wall. (bell ringing) All right, hold it. Drop the gun. Drop it. Now untie the girl. Come on. Jean, are you all right? I'm all right. It's a good thing we rigged up that little burglar alarm. Yeah, it worked fine. What were they after? The film, but don't ask me why. The police can probably figure it out when they question this one. Sanders is taking Cass and the film to town tomorrow, eh? I guess so. You'll have to stop him. I don't care how you do it, but you must get Cass and that film away from Sanders. I'll try. That's far enough. Let's get back in the brush. You sit tight. (guns firing) Get around behind him. (engine starts) (regal music) (guns blasting) Get around behind him. (arrow whooshes) (log thuds) (jeep roaring) Cass got away with the film. That's all we wanted anyway, come on. (birds chirping) What did you do with Sanders' jeep? I left it in the Utanga country. I wasn't gonna bring it here. Of course not. The worst of it is, Sanders will be gunning for us now. He might even get some constables to help him. You'll have the whole jungle to yourselves once Chief Danka's people are scared away. Sanders and the girl will have to leave then too. It would still be a lot safer if we got rid of them first. Naturally, don't miss any opportunity to eliminate them. Now about the mining, we'll let that go for the time being. [Cass] How can we make any money that way? How much would we make if anyone learned what we're doing? Illicit diamond mining is very dangerous business. We'll wait until it's safe. In the meantime, we must keep our monsters near the Utanga village. The one in the crate is big enough to release now. All right, we'll dump them out and get the beaters to herd them towards the village. Good, but remember you and the natives must protect it. We'll take care of the claw monster. (monster growling) [Rand] Tie this to the tree, Ebu. Yeah, we want to be as far away as we can when we dump it. (monster growling) (Ebu yelling in foreign language) Yeah, it looks pretty nasty. Better have Morgan doctor him up. Hey, wait, you go Utanga village. White woman fix you up. You say devil beast caught you in jungle near the village. I don't get it. It'll help two ways. That chewed up arm will throw a scare into the village natives, and if Sanders and that girl come out to look for the monster, we got a chance to ambush them. Yeah, that makes sense. [Cass] Dump it. (guns cocking) (monster growling) Herd him towards the village. (natives yelling in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) [Larry] It's a Returis. This man was attacked by one of the monsters. His arm is badly cut. If I can use your first aid kit, I'll dress it for him. Why of course, I'll be glad to help you. You don't need to. I thought you and Mr. Sanders would want to go after the monster at once. It sounds like a good chance, Jean. Where was this monster? Down wet trail, cross small river. That's only a couple of miles, isn't it? That's right, you take the camera crew up the trail. I'll get my elephant and circle around behind it. [Larry] All right, you better get your equipment together. Joli, move. [Jean] Tembo, don't forget my rifle. Yes, bwana lady, I'll bring it. Bela. (elephant trumpets) (sticks cracking) (monster growling) (speaking in foreign language) Go after her. (arrows whooshing) (water splashing) (arrows whooshing) (speaking foreign language) She's gonna make it. That's alright, Samba's over there, he'll catch her. We'll circle around the lake. You two take care of the monster. Go, go. Did you get her? Yes, tied to tree back there. What we do with her? If we leave her there, some animal will finish her off before long. Hunter drum bring animals. Good, go ahead. (drum beating) (animals scampering) (gorilla grunting) How the drum call, bring animals, they fight, kill. It's coming from over by the lake. Those hunters might be trying to cause trouble for Miss Evans. Tembo, you take the men back to the village. I'm going to look into this. Yes, bwana. (Tembo speaking foreign language) (gorilla grunting) (Jean screaming) I guess that finishes her, let's go. (speaking foreign language) (gun banging) (Jean screaming) (regal music) (ominous music) (growling) (screaming) I guess that finishes her, let's go. (gunshots) (screaming) (intense music) (gunshots) Ebu said the Sanders brought the panther girl back to the village and she's okay. You should have made sure of her yourself. Maybe, but we figured it'd be less chance of an investigation if we let the gorilla do the job. Yes, I suppose you're right. But we must do something to get the Utanga district cleaned out so we can get on with our diamond mining before anyone finds out what we're doing. Well, Ebu says Chief Danka's people are plenty worried. But they haven't started to move out yet. Then we'll help them make up their minds. Did the girl injure that last claw monster when she shot at it? I don't know. Locate it and find out. If it's dead or hurt, we'll have to go another. Alright. (ominous music) Those first attacks were made by Raturi tribesmen. I figured that Cass and Rand had hired them to get rid of me so they could hunt this district. Now they're going after you too. I don't know what to make of it. I don't either. We should call in the authorities. This might be the beginning of a serious revolt. I'll ask Chief Danka to send a runner to town with a note. It's a good thought. Jean, what about this fellow Morgan? Didn't you say he lived in the jungle by himself? He lives just outside the Utanga country in the Raturi district. However, he's never had any trouble with the Raturi's that I know it. That situation could change. If they've really gone on a warpath, it could be dangerous for him. I think I'll go warn him. Maybe you'd better. You stick around the village til I get back, hmm? (intense music) [Man] Hey look. Must be the one we thought they'd killed. They'll scare every Utanga in the Kongo. Let's go tell Morgan. (knocking) Come in. Dr. Morgan? Yes. My name's Larry Sanders. Oh, I'm glad to know you. I'm glad to know you. I've heard about this. You have quite a laboratory here. Yes, I'm doing some chemical research. Are you on safari? No, no, I'm staying over in Chief Danka's village. I've been helping Miss Evans. Oh yes, the lady photographer. I met her. How's she getting along? Lately not so good. We've been attacked several times by Raturi natives. Oh? That's strange. They've always seemed quite peaceful to me. Maybe so, but they've been giving us a lot of trouble. In fact, that's why I'm here. I came over to warn you. Well, I certainly appreciate you going to all that trouble. (ominous music) Alright, now drop the guns. Hurry it up. That's better, now step away from them. Go on. Dr. Morgan, do you know these men? Why yes. That is quite casually, they've dropped in here once or twice before, said they were hunters. Potential thieves and killers would be a better description. I'm gonna take you two into the commissioner. Let's go. Don't you think you ought to tie their hands? It's a long way into town. Here, I'll help you. Put down your hands. (intense music) (crashing glass) Now we can finish him for good. Not here you idiot. Miss Evans is sure to know where he went. Maybe we could drag him out into the jungle. No, that won't do either. If he fails to come back, the girl will certainly notify the authorities and this is the first place they'd investigate. You two clear out. I'll square myself with them. I'll signal you when he's gone. Okay. No, leave the guns there. Do as I tell you. So I finally managed to get your gun and drive them off. I'm sorry I couldn't capture them for you. That's alright Doctor. Commissioner's sending a constable out tomorrow to investigate this native trouble. They can check on Cass and Rand too. Oh? That should take care of them. I think so. Thanks again for everything. Don't mention it. Oh and doctor, you'd better remember what I said about those Raturi's. Watch yourself. Oh I will. (drumming) That's it, let's go. We ought to be able to keep outta the way of one constable. There's an awful lot of jungle out there. That wouldn't help. He's still talk to the Raturi's and find out they were working with you and with me. We can't afford that. It's no use killing the constable. They'd just send out another one. That's true but meanwhile, we'd have time to make sure an investigation wouldn't hurt us. I see what you mean. Well they'll probably take the river trail to the Raturi country. We'll get em as they cross the river. Good, but keep out of it yourselves. There may be some Utanga bearers with em, this has to look like Raturi work. Alright Rand, let's go. (ominous music) They come! Have the girl and two white men! Those stakes mark river crossing. You change them so white man get caught in quicksand. Then you stay and kill them easy. How much further to the Raturi country? About a mile just across the river. Be sure you stay close to these crossing stakes. It's the only way through the quicksand. Well in that case, I'll stay real close. Geez. Quicksand Larry! Get some vines! (foreign language) (gunshots) (intense music) I've got to help him. Go ahead, I'll try to keep them down. I'll try again. (intense music) (regal music) (dramatic music) (guns firing) I've got to help him. Go ahead, I'll try to keep them down. (bullet ricocheting) (arrow swishing) (gun firing) (bow snapping) I'll try again. (suspenseful music) You all right, old man? I'm still in one piece, if that's what you mean. I winged one of those baggers up on the bank. We'd best go after him. We can get across a little farther up. Let's get started. (water splashing) Did it work? No, one white man in quick-sand, maybe dead. Other with gun shoot Orto. Him hurt bad, you come. Now wait a minute, Morgan told us to keep out of it. Yeah, we better let it go at that. I thought the quick-sand would make it a cinch, but it didn't pan out. You don't know how badly Orto was hurt? No, but it doesn't make any difference. If he can talk, he knows what to say. Yes, if the authorities believe his explanation, it might even help us. But we must still keep crowding the claw monsters close to the Utanga village, where the natives can see it and back up the story. All right, I'll get Rand and we'll herd it back toward the village. (speaking foreign language) [Constable Harris] Ready? Where you take me? To town, probably to prison for a long time. It's against the law to try to kill people, even in the jungle. Me only try to kill people who bring devil beast. We didn't bring those monsters, we've been doing our best to track them down and kill them. You see them kill monster? No, they take picture. Yes, that is all. Panther Girl bad magic bring devil beast, make pictures for her. Devil beast kill natives. She no care. That's enough of that. Get in there. Tell Chief Danka. That kind of talk could cause trouble. Yeah, I think I'll ride along with you, Harris. Some of his friends might try to rescue him on the way in. Glad to have you. (motors starting) (perilous music) (men shouting) Don't crowd 'em too hard, we're getting close to the village. (monstrous growling) (screaming) (speaking foreign language) Chief Danka, what happened? Devil beast kill Zimba. Where? On the trail to the big spring, very close to here. How do you know it was the monster? We see tracks, claw marks too. I'll get my rifle and go after it. No, no, no good. You hunt devil beast before, never kill it. What does he mean by that? Is he blaming me for this? It's the story the Rituri tribesman told that your black magic brought these beasts. Wha-- Do you believe that? My people do. Then I'll have to prove to them that my magic is good. How will you do that? The test of the lion men. But you'll be killed! Not if my magic is good, isn't that true? So we believe. If I prove to you my magic is good, then you'll no longer believe I made bad magic to bring monsters? We believe you then. All right, get the costume. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (lion roaring) (dramatic music) (lion roaring) You know, I'm beginning to believe in your magic myself. What a crazy thing to do, Jean. You might have been killed. Look Larry, these natives believe their god is on my side. I want to keep it that way. I agree, but why do it the hard way? Seems to me it'd be a lot easier just to hunt down those monsters. I haven't had much luck at that so far. Well, just keep trying. Let's round up the crew and get started. I hate to force them to go. Since the monsters have been seen so close to the village, they don't want to leave their families unprotected. All right then, if you feel that way about it, why don't you and I just go by ourselves? - Good. - Go get changed. (suspenseful music) (eerie music) (men shouting) Wait, somebody behind that. They're herding it this way. (men yelling) - Hey, hey, hey hey! - Ha! They're driving that thing toward the village. Well this certainly gives us a tie-in. Yeah, but it still doesn't explain anything. Ha! If we go any further, they're liable to hear us in the village. Yeah, we better head back for the mine. I'd rather dig out diamonds than herd these things around. You and me both. They're taking the trail to the abandoned gold mine. Maybe they're using it for a hide-out, come on. (suspenseful music) How about some coffee before we start to work? Yeah, I could use some. So what do we do now? Move in and grab them. You know, there might be something in there to explain where those monsters come from. Hold it. You keep them covered, Jean, I'll tie their hands. (dramatic music) (flesh smacking) (fist thudding) (bullet ricocheting) (guns banging) (fuse hissing) Get down! (dynamite roaring) (rocks thudding) (climactic music) (regal music) (dramatic music) (fires gun) (firing guns) (intense music) Get down! (music intensifies) Out there! (dynamite explodes) (intense music) (coughs) Now what? We've only got one shell left. We'll have to hike back to the village and get some more artillery. By the time we get back here, they'll be gone. We can use my elephant on the way back. It'll save us a little time. Yeah. If they're not dead yet, they will be soon. That tunnel's blocked solid. Yeah, well, that's sad. But it'll change our whole set up. We better go talk to Morgan. Yes, this will simplify things for us. Now we must let Chief Danka know that the Panther Girl is dead. Sanders too, of course. It sure wouldn't be healthy for us to be seen in his village. Then send your Ituri's. If they go there unarmed, they won't have any trouble. Alright. There's a good chance the Utangas may pull out now. Then we can get back to work on the diamonds without anybody else finding out about it. I hope that's the way it'll work out. But Chief Danka might send a runner to town and ask for a posse to look for Sanders and the girl. If that should happen, you'd better see that the runner doesn't get to town. We got our Jeep handy, but I'm betting we won't have to use it. The village is in enough of a panic over the Claw Monsters already. And without the girl there to stop them, they'll stampede quick. They might. Especially if your spies tell Chief Danka that the Claw Monster killed Sanders and the Panther Girl. I guess we better make sure there's a Claw Monster close enough to the village to keep them convinced. (intense music) You go to village. You go to village to talk. Go like friend, no need these. (intense music) We'll be looking for the Devil Beast. (intense music) Where's your elephant? She roams around that patch of open jungle across the river. I'll find her and meet you somewhere along the trail. Alright, make it that first clearing across the river. Tembo and I will walk up the trail. You'll probably get there first, so just sit tight and wait. Alright. I just hope Cass and Rand will still be at the mine. It won't make too much difference, Tembo can pick up their tracks. I wanna get a better look at that mine anyway. Maybe we can figure out what they're up to. Have Tembo carry my rifle, will you? Mmm-hmmm. (intense music) Tembo! (music intensifies) Bila! Bila! (elephants trumpets) (intense music) (speaking native language) (intense music) (music intensifies) (screams) (intense music) (speaking native language) Panther Girl, she not dead. What? You sure? She ride elephant. We fix vine. Pull her off. You come. You bet we will! (intense music) Look Tembo. (elephant trumpets) I wonder if that's the Panther Girl's elephant. I think. I call. Bila! Bila! (elephant trumpets) (intense music) (elephant blows) She's trying to... Tembo, something's happened to the Panther Girl. Yes, Bila want you go with her. (elephant blows) Here. Good work, Bila. You follow us. Yes, Wana. (intense music) That's her, alright. She and Sanders must've gotten out of that mine. But how? I don't know. Question is now, how do we finish her off? Monster! (intense music) There's your answer. That monster will take care of her for us. Right, let's get behind it. (intense music) (music intensifies) There's Sanders now. (gun fires) (music intensifies) (guns firing) Rifle, Tembo! (guns firing) We better pull out. (guns firing) They're moving out fast. Can you track them, Tembo? White man boot make plenty trail. Good. So it looks like a chance to run them down. Let's get your elephant. Come on. (intense music) This does it. That tracker can trail us from here to Timbuktu. We can't outrun that elephant. Yeah. We better head for the Jeep. Ituri's, tell Morgan we'll be back in a day or two. (intense music) Well, that's that. We'll never catch them now. But there's only one road they can take out of here and that leads them right to town. They're sure to stop there for a while. If I could get there soon enough, I could probably find them. Let's get back to the village. (intense music) Alright fellas, closing time. Alright, in a minute. (intense music) Sorry mack, the bar is closed. I know. I'm not after a drink. Let's take a walk boys, you're under arrest. Wait a minute, are you an officer? No, I'm making a citizen's arrest. These men are wanted, I'm gonna take them in. Oh, alright. I guess it's none of my business. Move. (music intensifies) (punching, glass breaking) (intense music) (punching) (music intensifies) (intense music) (music intensifies) (chair breaking) (punching) (intense music) (music intensifies) (wood breaking) (intense music) (regal music) (dramatic music) Now what? Sanders will have all the cops in town after us if we don't stop him. You can tangle again with him if you want to but not me, I'm checking out. Wait a minute. We won't have to go after him ourselves. Nick Burgess has that room right next to ours. So what? That big gorilla hasn't got sense enough to come in out of the rain. Who cares about his brains? He's the best knife fighter in this country and he'll do anything for money. If we can get him down there in time to take care of Sanders, we can get out of town. Yeah. That oughta do it. You better call the police right now before those birds fly the coup. That's just what I intend to do. I want to thank you for all you've done. I really appreciate it. Too late for a drink, the bar is closed. I'm having a drink. The bar is closed. (grunting) Mister you better go home. Not until I have that drink. (struggling) Does anyone know you came back here? I don't see how they could. As soon as we saw Sanders leave the saloon, we took off. We didn't meet anybody on the way out. Well, you're as safe in the jungle as anywhere. But don't come around here anymore than you have to. Police are probably looking for you now. We're no hotter now than we were before. All we did was put up a fight when Sanders tried to arrest us and he sure can't prove we hired Burgess. No, but he'll be gunning for you now and your only safe move is to get him first. We tried that once before. I know but this time set a trap in a good location and lure him into it. Just how do we do that? If one of your natives went to the Utanga village and reported he saw claw monsters in a certain spot, Sanders and the girl would go there looking for him wouldn't he? Yeah. That would get him where we want him but we still have to finish him off. Suppose you were to plant some dynamite in the trail and touch it off at the right time. Yeah a landmine, that's a good idea. We'll get the deal set up. Bartender substantiated my story about what happened to the thug and the police let me go. By then, Cass and Rand had a two hour head start. I couldn't find any trace of them. Maybe they came back up here. You know, that's possible. The police didn't seem to think so. At least they wouldn't send anyone out here to look for them. Well aren't they interested in what goes on up here? Well yes and no. You can't really blame them, Jean. Those claw monsters do sound a bit fantastic. It's pretty hard to convince anyone they actually exist. Then we'll just have to get more pictures as proof. I guess that's the only way. The natives calmed down enough, they'd be willing to help? I think so. None of the monsters have been near the village since Cass and Rand left. In that case-- (natives speaking foreign language) What is it Chief Danka? This man of the Rituri Tribe has seen a devil beast. Where? On trail, near old mine, you come kill him. You bet we will. Can you guide us to it? I sure will, then I go. That's fair enough. Tembo you get the camera crew together. We'll leave right away. We'll take three rifles this time, Tembo. You'll be safe enough. Alright, we go. (speaking in foreign language) Wait a minute, Jean! What is it? Take a look at this. I'd say it's a claw monster track, pretty fresh too. Yes, devil beast crossed trail short time and go that way. No, not there. Me see devil beast in canyon. Well then this must be another one. Let's get after it. Me scared. Go now. Jean you better leave the men here till we locate him. [Jean] You stay here. We won't go far. We'll be back soon. Yes Bwana lady. (speaking in foreign language) This look alright? Yeah go ahead. (eerie music) (gunshots) Shall we follow it into that brush? No that's too dangerous, especially if it's wounded. Jean seeing as we haven't had too much luck with our rifles I think your camera would be the best bet. Why don't you get the crew and set up right here? I'll get ahead of the monster and drive it back this way. Alright. What's a matter? White man see tracks. Go in jungle. Hunt devil beast there. No come here. What a break. Where is he now? Not stay on trail. Him go that way. We better try to find him. You wait. (growling) Ahh! (gunshot) Ahh! That must be him over that way. (shouting) (gunshots) Hold it! Now drop your guns. Drop them! (gunshots) Bwana Sanders must be in trouble. You and the men stay here. Yes Bwana lady. Sure dug in there. Yeah, regular fort. (gunshots) Gee, that dynamite oughta blast him out of there. Go back and get it. (gunshots) Give me that dynamite. Keep him pinned down. Now! (explosion) (exciting music) (regal music) (dramatic music) (guns firing) Now! (guns firing) (explosion booming) (tree branches creaking) Good work, Jean. What about Cass? He ended up on the other side of the tree. He's long gone by now. Where's your camera crew? Back where we first the claw monster. Now we better check on 'em. I heard one of those monsters headed that way. (gun firing) Well, I'd say the monster got here alright. I don't see any signs of a fight. The crew probably lost their nerve and ran. Yeah, that leaves us a lot of weight to carry. Let's get at it. I understand it was a bad break. But we'll never be able to scare Chief Danka and his people away from the village as long as Sanders and the Panther Girl are alive. You'll have to try again. We haven't got a chance of working another ambush now, Morgan, they know we're trying to gun 'em down. That's probably true. But if you and Rand dropped out of sight for a week or so they might relax. Then you could strike. That makes sense. Yeah, suppose we hole up in the mine for a while. We can screen gravel while we're waiting. Now that's an idea. It's about time we got out some of those diamonds. Where's the screening equipment? We hid it down by the riverbank. It'll only take an hour or so to get it from there to the mine. Well, alright, I guess we can risk it. But remember, if anyone sees that equipment, they'll know there are diamonds around here, and if that happens we might as well give up. They won't see the stuff. We'll make sure of it. You know, with Cass and Rand on the loose again it looks like we're right back where we started. We'll have a rough time making any more pictures. My camera crew won't go into the jungle again. Can't say that I blame them. Those claw monsters backed up by white men with rifles make it a pretty rough combination. Jean, why don't we forget about trying to photograph monsters for a while? Let's concentrate on rounding up Cass and Rand. You think we can track them from where we had the fight? That trail will be pretty cold by now. I think our best bet would be the old mine. They could still be using that for a hideout. Even if they aren't, we might be find something that'll give us an idea of where the monsters come from and what Cass and Rand are trying to do with them. Alright, let's take a canoe. It'll save us most of the hike through the jungle. That's a good idea. Be with you in a minute. Hey, here comes a canoe. Looks like Sanders and that Evans girl. We gotta stop 'em before they see this equipment. Get it out of here. Long range, but if we let 'em get any closer they'll spot the mining gear. (guns firing) [Jean] Get to shore. (guns firing) Those shots came from about a hundred yards away. Yeah, I know. We're safe enough here, but we'll never get around that bend as long as they're covering it. I could sneak around behind and keep 'em busy until you get past. And then what? I'll meet you up there where the river widens out. I don't know, Jean. They'll never catch me in the jungle. Alright, but be careful. I'll take off as soon as I hear the shooting. (gun firing) (guns firing) How'd they get back there? Must've landed and circled around through the jungle. We can play that game, too. You keep 'em pinned down. (guns firing) I got Sanders. He was trying to sneak up the river. Good going. Must be just the girl up there now. Yeah, she still there? I don't know, she stopped firing a few minutes ago. You better locate her before she runs on to that screening equipment. (growling) (dramatic orchestral music) This is where she was alright. Maybe she cut back to the river. Let's take a look. What happened? Plenty. Sure didn't work the way we planned. They started throwing slugs at me. Dumped the canoe and it hit me in the head. Look at that, I lost my gun, too. We better get out of sight. They're probably still around here someplace. - Yeah. - Come on. Up that way. (gun firing) (guns firing) One revolver against two rifles doesn't give us very good odds. Yeah, they're between us and the village. (guns firing) Let's get up to the old mine. It's not very far, and we can hold 'em off from there. (gun firing) Come on. (guns firing) Now what? We'll light that stuff and throw it inside. That'll smoke 'em out. Right. Only three shots left. Yeah, and mine won't fit your gun. Get down behind here. (flames crackling) (gun firing) (wood crackling) (clicking) Let's rush 'em! (gun firing) (flames roaring) (triumphant horn music) (regal music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (clicking) Let's rush 'em! (dramatic music) (gunfire) Well, that was a close one. Yeah, too close and too hot. Jeanie, I hate to say this but you really think you have to stay in the Yutanga District? There are a lot of places in Africa where you can take pictures of wild animals. I never heard of Larry Sanders wanting to quit a job just because it was too dangerous. Now, wait just a minute, I was thinking of you. You're a girl. Alright, you win. But this time let's try some different tactics and let's try to trap one of those monsters. Maybe we can do it at that. Sure we can. You know, we seen a lot of tracks on that trail leading to the river. I'll bet if we dug ourselves a real deep pit, we'll have some luck. Alright, let's head back to the village and get the natives started. Now we're really out of ammunition. I sure hope Cass and Rand aren't out there waiting for us. (suspenseful music) They probably didn't find any trace of your mining operations but they certainly know you've been living there. So you must stay away until we see what their next move is. Make yourselves a camp out in the jungle. I don't want to risk your being seen around here. Okay, we'll have a Ituri watch the village and keep us posted in case Sanders and the panther girl try anything unusual. Very well. (suspenseful music) That's good. Alright boys, let's get back to the village, huh? We'll check on this first thing in the morning. (suspenseful music) White one and village men dig pit trap on trail to river. When? Just do. All go back to village now. Figure they're trying to trap one of those claw monsters? That must be it. Well we've got to stop them. I don't want to run into one of those things in the dark. Me neither. We'll just have to get there ahead of them in the morning. They got one alright. Yeah. We've got to get him out of there. But how? Shovel in enough dirt so it can climb out. (suspenseful music) Here they come! (gunfire) (suspenseful music) Well, we're in luck. I wonder what they were up to. They were trying to wreck the trap. They were a little late seeing as we've already caught something. Larry, get the camera crew. Alright. (growling) Larry! (suspenseful music) Tembo, get the first aid kit. (speaking foreign language) Larry, no, the camera. Alright. I'm no cinematographer, Jeanie. You better take over. Plug it in, Larry. Ready. (film rolling) That's close enough. (gunfire) I could go after him but I think we better get you back to the village to take care of that leg. Might as well. I know I've got some good film here. I don't want to take any chances on losing it. Tembo, let's get this gear together. It's alright, come on. Well, I guess they'll get their pictures all right. Maybe we can still stop 'em. No, we haven't got a chance against that gang and their rifles but he has to get that film to town to have it developed. Yeah, that's right. We stopped them once before. Sure, we can do it again in the same way. You go watch village. When white one leave in his car, you make drum signal. Well, here it is. You can take it to town the first thing in the morning and get it developed. Alright, but don't forget what happened the last time I started to take film into town. You mean they might try to stop you again? Well, they did once before. We lost the first batch of film, Jean. I'd certainly hate to lose this one. Say, isn't there some way you can develop it yourself right here? Well, I have all the equipment but I'm out of chemicals. Well then we're stuck. Say, wait a minute, Logan's Trading Post down the river has the supply. Good, I'll take a canoe down river. Will Logan know what you need? He'll know. Then there's no problem. Oh, you better hide that film somewhere, just in case. Eel, eel, white one go in canoe down river. He can't get to town that way. No. He must be up to something else. Well what do we do about it? We'll grab the girl and make her give us the film. She's alone there now. Alone in the village full of natives? Oh, don't worry about them. In the shape they're in, anything'll scare 'em off. Get that log off the road. Now. (gunfire) (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) [Cass] You must have hit her an awful belt. [Rand] I had to stop her. Sure but she's no good to us unless she can tell us where the film is. Well, we can't wait around here for her to come to, the natives are liable to sneak back. Sanders isn't likely to do anything about the film with her missing. Get some rope. We'll load her into a canoe and take her back to camp. Alright. (suspenseful music) He couldn't have gone any further than the trading post. Let's get out of sight. (suspenseful music) Alright, Sanders, this time we're gonna get that film. (gunfire) (dramatic music) (gunfire) (dramatic music) (regal music) (dramatic music) Did you find Chief Danka? No, no, not a sign of him or his people. You think they'll come back now that things have quieted down? I hope so. If they're not back by the morning I think we should do something about it. Yeah. How long is it gonna take you to develop the film? I should have a print by tonight. Good, I phoned Commissioner Stanton from the trading post, told him to get out here as soon as he could. It should be some time tonight. There's a surprise in store for him. No doubt about that. If those claw monsters look have as tough on film as they do in real life, it should convince them we need plenty of help tracking them down. And you still don't know where the film is? Not exactly but it's a cinch Sanders didn't take it to town. He wasn't gone long enough. How do you know he isn't on his way with it now? Too late in the day. Nobody makes that trip in the dark. Then there's a good chance the film is still there and it must be destroyed along with Sanders and the girl. Have the natives come back to the village yet? No. My scout says they're camped out in the jungle too scared to move. Then you can make a direct attack tonight. It might not be that simple. We'll have to break into their shacks to get to 'em. I can take care of that for you. I have materials here for making a bomb. All you have to do is toss it through a window and they'll be nobody left inside to bother us. All ready now. Sit down Commissioner. Thank you. It's amazing, absolutely amazing. That's an understatement sir. What is it and where did it come from? We don't know all the answers, Commissioner Stanton but we do know that Cass and Rand have something to do with the monsters. You mean, you think they brought them here? Perhaps. We aren't sure. Why don't you start from scratch? Let's all sit down, you can tell the commissioner the whole story. That's a very good idea. Well the first time I saw one of these creatures I managed to get a few pictures of it. The natives were frightened to death. They all threatened to turn around and leave me so I called Larry in to help out. (gunfire) We must have hit it. Yeah but we sure didn't stop. Tell you what, Jean, you follow it from here, slowly, and I'll circle around and try to get in front of it. Right. (growling) (suspenseful music) (growling) (screams) Larry! (gunfire) Jean. I'm alright except for the shoulder. You're lucky you still have a shoulder. Come on, panther girl, let's get back to the village and break out the first aid kit. So the Ituri tribesman attacked you. Well, that's serious business. It's extremely serious, Commissioner, and we're positive now that Cass and Rand put them up to it. Yes but can you prove that? I think so. All the evidence points that way. When Cass and Rand discovered that we had the film, the first thing they tried to do was steal it. One night they came right here to this cottage. Take it easy, all we want is that reel of film. Get something to tie her up with. Get over against the wall. (bell ringing) Alright, hold it. Drop the gun, drop it. Now untie the girl. Go on. (dramatic music) Jeanie, you alright? I'm alright. It's a good thing we rigged up that little burglar alarm. It worked fine. What were they after? The film but don't ask me why. The police can probably figure it out when they question this one. Yes I remember you reported that incident. You never got your prisoners back to town, did you? No, I'm afraid not. Oh, I got started alright but before I went very far. You sit tight. (gunfire) (dramatic music) Get around behind 'em. (dramatic music) Cass got away with the film. That's all we wanted anyway. Come on. Well this situation has gone far enough. You may be assured that my office will give you all the assistance possible. Thank you very much commissioner. Would you care for some tea? I should love some. (suspenseful music) Looks like they're in there. Yeah, go ahead and take a look. They're both in there with Commissioner Stanton and they've been running some film. So what? This'll take care of all of them and the film too. (dramatic music) (bomb explodes) (big band music) (regal music) Looks like they're in there. Yeah, go ahead and take a look. They're both in the room with Commissioner Stanton. They've been running some film. So what, this will take care of all of them and the film too. (dynamite sizzling) (Larry yells) (table thuds) (dynamite explodes) Ah, looks like a clean job, but we'd better make sure. (gun firing) Was it Cass and Rand again? Oh, who else? Well, you can rest assured those two are about at the end of their rope now. I'll go back to town first thing in the morning, and I'll have two constables here by tomorrow night, and they'll stay here until this whole situation is cleaned up. Thank you, sir. But, until they get here, I think you two better stay well under cover. But we've got to do something about the village natives. We can't just leave them roaming around in the jungle. Do you think they're going to come back here now? I think we can persuade them to if we promise to protect them from those claw monsters, and from Cass and Rand. At any rate, we'll get them to come back here and wait until your constables arrive. It's worth a try but be very careful with those two outlaws. They'll stop at nothing now. That's pretty obvious. So Commissioner Stanton knows the whole story. I tell you, we'll have the constables on our trail inside of a day or two. Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Well, all we can do is get out as many diamonds as we can and be ready to run for it when we have to. Sanders and the girl know we've been using the mine for a hideout, and that's the first place they'll head for when the constables get here. Probably, but as you pointed out, we may have a day or two. You can post Returis guards along the trail to warn you if anyone is coming. We've got the Returis watching Chief Danka's village. That's not important now. Well, maybe we can take a chance on it. We've got plenty of loose gravel ready, so it won't take long to sift out a batch of stones. Good, you can get started the first thing in the morning. Well, how about some of that jungle juice, your private stock? Well, alright. (birds chirping) You stay here, watch trail. If anyone comes, try to stop them. If you can't, run and tell us, we'll be in the mine. (speaking foreign language) There's no telling where the villagers are. We'll just have to hunt for them. I think I'd better get the elephant and work through the jungle east of here. I'll head up toward the old mine. They might be camped in that vicinity. Good, I'll meet you at the river crossing. Bila. (elephant trumpets) (arrow whooshes) (gun bangs) (arrows whooshing) (gun firing) (speaking foreign language) (water splashing) (thuds) (water bubbling) (water splashing) (gasping) Larry, what happened? Some of the Returis were guarding the trail to the old mine. They attacked me and took after. I walked right into an ambush. I heard your shots. It's a good thing you showed up. So did you find any trace of the village natives? There's a fresh trail just over the ridge, also some claw monster tracks. Then we'd better get after it quick. (coughs) They went through here not long ago. They can't be far away. Yeah. (monster grunting) Jean. (guns banging) Slow down while I reload. (monster breathing heavily) Take it easy. This is real luck. Yeah, and this ought to convince the natives it isn't a devil beast. Now they'll be glad to come back to the village. Let's find them. Are you sure the monster's dead? Of course, go see for yourselves. Where are bad white men? Well, we don't know, but I'm gonna check on them. There are some native guards on the trail to the mines so the white men might be there. Do you think we should try to tackle them alone? No, but I thought I'd try and locate their camp, then when the constables get here we'll know where to look. I see. Are you ready to go back to the village? We'll go if you go with us. Well, I, I-- Go ahead, Jean, I'll just do a little scouting. All right, but be careful, there may be guards along that trail. I'll be alright. (birds chirping) (natives speaking foreign language) (Larry speaking foreign language) (leaves rustling) (men scuffling) White bwana come to river trail, him catch Orto. Are they still there? Maybe. Let's go. Get in. (gun bangs) Get in. You're going to back to the Utanga village. When the constables get there, you're going to lead us to wherever Cass and Rand are hiding out. (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (regal music) Get in. (gun firing) Get in. You're going back to the Utanga village. When the constables get there, you're gonna lead us to wherever Cass and Rand are hiding out. (speaking foreign language) (guns banging) What do you think? I think we got him. Anyway, I'm not gonna swim out there and find out. Let's go see Morgan. You don't even know if he's dead, and even if he is, it won't make any difference now. The authorities are sure to send someone out to run you down and the claw monster too. Yeah, but they won't know where to find us. The Panther Girl knows you've been hanging out in the mine. She's sure to take them there. Well, what do we do? Just what you're supposed to be doing right now, screen out as many diamonds as you can before they get here. Okay, Morgan, we'll get the natives back to work guarding the trail. Of course, and get enough to hold up any attacking party until you get clear. Hey, how about herding a crawfish down the trail? That ought to keep the cops busy for a while. I have another in the crate now, but it won't be full grown until tomorrow. I'll release it then if we still need it. Here, give it some of this hormone compound as you go out. Okay. So you think they may still be in the mine? Well, they have been using it for a hideout and the natives said they were there yesterday. Even if they're gone now, we might find some clue that will put us on their trail. Very well, then the mine it is. [Jean] Ready? All ready, we're gonna try the old mine first. Good. (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (arrows whooshing) I don't think Cass and Rand are in this, only a few natives. We should be able to get through without killing any of them. Kent, why do you and Davis hold them from here while Miss Evans and I circle around their flank. All right, let's give it a try. Jean. (arrow whooshing) (guns banging) That's enough. (gun fires) Drop your bows. Good work, Sanders, but it's going to be a bit awkward going on to the mine with these prisoners on our hands. Hmm, you're right. You and Davis manage to take them back to the village by yourselves? Of course. Then that's it, you two take the prisoners back to the village, Miss Evans and I will go into the mine. We'll join up later. Righto. Good luck. [Kent] Down the trail, you chaps. (box thuds) (gun cocks) (guns firing) Get me a stick of that dynamite. (dynamite sizzling) Get out, Jean. (dynamite exploding) Get me three sticks this time. (dynamite sizzling) (dynamite exploding) (coughs) Well, that's that. I wonder what they were trying to do around here. This mine's been dead for years. They were screening gravel, that means diamonds. Yeah. Look at these. Well, that explains everything. Almost. That's the acid for testing the stones. Say, you need a special permit to buy this stuff. Jean, if we can find out where Cass and Rand got it, we can probably find out who's been behind them in all this. Well, I doubt if they even carry that kind of acid in town. Yeah, no one would have any use for it except mining and research chemists. Chemist, Dr. Morgan, he's a chemist. That's an idea, let's check on him. (monster breathing heavily) Well. It certainly ties Morgan in alright. Yeah, let's see what he has to say. (knocking at door) [Morgan] Come in. Well, how nice. Dr. Morgan. Won't you sit down? I don't have visitors very often. I'm afraid this isn't a social call, Doctor. I'll get right to the point. What do you know about diamonds in this area? A good deal, but it won't be necessary to discuss the subject. I can see you know too much about it already. This flask contains a very quick-acting poisonous gas. If I break it in front of you, I'll make it through the door, but you won't. Put those guns on that chair over there. All of them. Now push it over here. That's far enough. Now step back. Now we can discuss this more calmly. (bowl thuds) (gun bangs) (scuffling) (head thuds) (men scuffling) (glass shatters) (table crashes) (acid sizzles) (Jean coughs) It's amazing, according to these records, Dr. Morgan was quite a guy. Yes, he might have been one of the world's greatest scientists if he hadn't been in such a hurry to make money. As it is, the growth hormones he developed are the most effective ever known. Then you're sure he grew these claw monsters. Oh, yes, we tried the stuff on ordinary crawfish and the results were identical. [Jean] Well, isn't it dangerous to create any more of these monsters? No, it's not too risky, you see they only live a few days after they've attained their full growth. [Larry] Have you give this stuff to any other animal? Yes, we've experimented with rats and mice, but we find the stuff's deadly poison to any warmblooded animal. Well, that's a shame. You know I've given serious thought to taking a shot of it myself. Oh, but you couldn't do that, the stuff's deadly poison. Don't you think we might have a dish of tea?
