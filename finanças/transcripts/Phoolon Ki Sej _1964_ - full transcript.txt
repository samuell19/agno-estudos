"He will come. My beloved will come." "The weather says, this air says." "He will make a song dwell in my heart." "He will come. My beloved will come." "The weather says, this air says." "He will make a song dwell in my heart." "He will come." "Where am I and where my heart is." "I am lurching." "Like a drunkard." "This weather is lovely." "The whole world is saying." - "What?" "He will come. My beloved will come." "The weather says, this air says." "He will make a song dwell in my heart." "He will come." "The colourful waterfall plays this tune." "The sweet voice of the lake is saying." "Your heart will be stolen." "Be prudent." - "Really!" "He will come. My beloved will come." "The weather says, this air says." "He will make a song dwell in my heart." "He will come." "This hope of meeting you has been fulfilled." "Then why does this craving of lifetimes harass me?" "The flower of life has blossomed." "Really?" "He will come. My beloved will come." "The weather says, this air says." "He will make a song dwell in my heart." Boss, you build roads in the whole country.. ..that connects one village to the other. Now make such a road that will connect one heart with the other. You can recite poems later. First do your work. - Okay, boss. Hey, ma'am! Spread this somewhere else. Why not here? This is an independent country. I have the freedom to come and you have the freedom to go. Dismiss! - Not you, only my boss can dismiss me. I will dismiss your boss too. Where is he? - There. Boss! What happened? - I have been dismissed. Dismiss. Who dismissed you? - The one who dismissed you. Who dismissed me? - The one who dismissed both of us. Now you only say. Look, he is mad. You gather your stuff from here. Tiffin! Boss, you too have your lunch here. What rubbish! Let's do our work first! Let's fool them and invite them for lunch. - Fine. Listen! Will you both have lunch with us? Why not! Boss, she is calling us so lovingly. Look, unnecessarily you will be troubled. There will be no trouble. As it is, we have the leftovers for the crows. I am not a crow! First indirectly ask him as to what he is, Karuna! You will come to know. - I have seen many like you! My purse! Hey I want to go first.. Come, come. - Come! Bye-bye! Bye-bye. Hurry up! Come here. What is the fare of this boat? - 5 rupees, sir. I will give you 10 rupees. - 10 rupees! Yes. I don't want just the boat! Hey, boatman! How much is the fare? I don't sail the boat on fares. I only take the reward. You will get it. You will get whatever you want. Really? Do you promise? - You are so shameless! I will have to toil, ma'am! A person can do that if he has some hope. Okay, you can come and sit. I trust your words. Come. Come on! Come on! Hurry up! Yes, I am doing that, ma'am. We both are in haste. Come on! Sail over there! Hurry up! Neelu! Wait! I am coming! - Hurry up! Why are you going there? I am asking where are you going? Where the wind blows. - And where is the wind blowing? Towards the direction of the heart. Hey, you! Stop the boat! The boat will stop only in the middle of the lake! You? - Yes. I wanted to tell you who I am! Quickly take me back otherwise I will.. Otherwise what will you do? - I will.. It is your fault! If you had not gone there, the boat would not have turned.. ..upside down and this would not have been our state. It is not my fault. It is your fault. If you had not picked up the oar to strike me.. ..then the boat would not have turned upside down.. ..and this would not have been our state. You are shameless. - And you are stubborn. Are you feeling cold? Drink this tea. Once even our boat had turned upside down like this. How? Our eyes locked, our hearts united, there was a storm.. ..and the boat drowned. Heard that! What the boat woman said! - What? Today too there was a storm. Today too the boat drowned. No matter how many guises you adopt.. ..you will never have me, you will never have me! I will not meet him! I will not meet him! - Who? Him! He thinks that he is great! So you met him? - I will not meet him! Then you will surely meet him. - Principal! Now everybody go to sleep. We have to leave for picnic tomorrow early in the morning. Tell me, what happened next? I only know that our boats went in one direction.. ..and your boat in the other direction. Then what happened? - The boat drowned. We all girls are going to Kodaikanal. You will come, won't you? To tell you the truth, even I want to come. But I don't want to go. You don't want to go, still you are going. - Then what to do? Do anything. Make some pretext or charade. Tell her that you have a fever. If I say that then the Principal will check in the thermometer. Tell her that your head is paining. - It is futile, Neelu. Principal will still give the pill and make me go. Then think of something else. - My mind is not working. Do whatever you want. Beena! Kamala! Come quickly! Come and support Karuna! What happened? - She can't walk. Walk as if you sprained your leg. Is it hurting a lot? - Yes. She can't even walk. It will be futile if you come for the picnic. You will have to walk for miles. It is better if you stay here only. Come, Neelu. Come, Kamala! Come. Bye, Karuna! - Bye-bye! You? - Yes, I knew that you won't go. You will come only with me. - No, I won't. Fine. Then I am going. Stop! I knew that in the battle between the mind and the heart.. ..the heart always wins. Now what? The bridge broke. - It will be repaired. What if it is not repaired? We will find another bridge. Some other road. Don't look behind, Karuna. The one who looks back, that person can never move forward. And the one who moves forward, he never looks back. "Come. Come and dwell in my heart."

You are feeling cold? Wear this coat. Now you are feeling cold. What to do? There is 1 coat and 2 people. How can 2 people wear 1 coat? Yes, they can wear it. Whose luggage is this? Who is going? It is our luggage. We are going. You are going today, I will go tomorrow. This is our transfer order. We have to reach Shillong immediately. By taking the first plane, first train, first bus. Now the last bus is about to depart. What if I don't go? You will lose your job. It will be better if you go. But it is important for me to meet her. - Who? Karuna? Yes. Nobody is in the bungalow, sir. Where have everybody gone? - I don't know, sir. They leave every morning and return in the evening. Will you do me a favour? - Yes. Do you know Karuna? The one who roams in this vehicle with sir? Yes. Tell her that Nirmal is returning today itself. So come to the bus stop immediately. - Yes, sir. Do give her the message. - Yes, sir. Come quickly, sir. It is getting late. - Hang on. Such is an affair of a man and a woman. The bus always gets stuck. Nirmal! Karuna, I was afraid that I might not be able to meet you! Are you really going? Yes. But I will return soon. I will take you to my brother and sister-in-law. They will be delighted to see you. Where is your family? I don't have one. I was raised in an orphanage. Completing my studies on the basis of scholarship. Come on, sir. Hurry up. The bridge will close down! Coming! Don't bore me! Where do you live? Where do you study? - In Bangalore. My house is in Hyderabad. I am going to Shillong for my work. Here is my address. Send your address in the letter. Do remember me. Can I forget you? will you write me a letter? Will I receive a reply? On one condition. Wipe these tears. I like smiling moonlight. Not tears. Come. The letter has not arrived? You have been asking this since months. You will receive a letter only if she writes a letter. I am eagerly waiting for her letter. Got the letter? - Yes. But not mine, it is yours. You put that in the pocket without reading it? It is futile to read it. Father writes every week. And the same thing always! He always asks.. what Nirmal gives you.. ..that you can't find here. And I say father, car. - Yes. - Father, car. But at least read it. Look at this. By mistake I wrote father, I am craving to see it. And father has sent the snap. Postman! Any letter for me? - No. Nirmal did not write today too. Have you gone mad, Karuna! Nirmal doesn't have your address.. ..and you expect him to write a letter. Come. On this happy occasion of women association's Rajat Jayanti.. ..I congratulate all of you. For encouraging female's education, country's culture.. ..the work that women association has done.. ..in the past 25 years, that is in front of you. Karuna will now present an example of this art.

I can't see anything, I can't hear anything. Greetings. Stop this crying. You will have to cry in the future. When people will make your life miserable.. When people will taunt you and they will say.. ..there goes the unwed mother. What will you say at that time? What will I say then? No! I have raised you up as a mother, Karuna. But today you will have to leave my shelter, Karuna. You will have to leave this college and this hostel. Have you thought where you will go? If I had a home, then I would have gone there. I am planning to go to Hyderabad. - Hyderabad? Yes. He had said that he has a home there. Where in Hyderabad? Which lane, which locality. This is what I don't know. - Then what do you know? You did not even ask who he is, where he stays and what he does! There was no time, Neelu. You did not have time at that time. Now the whole world has sufficient time to open their mouths! Neelu, even you are angry with me? Not with you, I am angry at my helplessness. I can give my life for you. But right now I can't do anything. I can't do anything. Now what is there to cry? Forget everything. This child was conceived in the village. But your child will be raised in the city. Under the care of Dr. Varma. Don't you know? Dr. Varma is such a renowned doctor. People from far and wide come to Hyderabad.. ..to be treated by him. - Unnecessarily you are worried. No need to worry. Take this medicine. And come after 4 days. What had happened before, that won't happen now. Greetings, doctor. - Greetings. Doctor.. my stomach is paining badly. This pain is killing me. You unnecessarily complain, Bihari. Go home. You can come. Sit. Have a seat. What is your trouble? I am pregnant, doctor. But I don't want this child. - What! I am unmarried. - You are unmarried! I implore you! This child in my womb.. I am a doctor. I save lives. I don't kill lives. Then you only tell me, doctor. Where should I go? Go to the person who has impregnated you. I don't know where he is. He gave me his address. But I lost it. And I am ruined, doctor. You have come to the wrong place. This is a clinic, not a police station. Can't you refer me to some other doctor? No. I know doctors, not butchers. I have not seen butchers, doctor. Today I came to know how butchers look like. - Like me? Then what! You see somebody's wounds. But you can't apply salve on it. You see a person falling, but you don't come forward to aid him. Why do people fall? There are others in the world too. Why don't they fall? They are fortunate. - This is not true. They respect women. Today too Goddess is worshiped in this country. Then why to touch a stranger's hand? Dr. Varma. Banerjee! I know. I will come for the operation at 5 o'clock. You be ready. Fine. You do one thing.. Nirmal, when did you come? - I am coming directly from the station. Where has the girl gone who was sitting inside? She went there, sir. - She went away? From here. - Who, brother? A poor female. She got pregnant before marriage. She doesn't even know where the father of the child is. Poor girl! I wonder what she was going through! I am thinking of the person who has made her such state, Nirmal. Think about me too, doctor. It is paining badly. - Come in. Nirmal, you sit. We will go home together. - Fine, brother. What happened! - Pick her up, pick her up. What happened! Let's take her somewhere. - To the house. Come. - Let's go. hurry up Not here! Go out and play! Where am I? At sister's house. - But how did I come here? You had fainted on the street. It was good that no car passed on top of you. That would have been better. Where are you going! I don't want to live! Nobody knows my pain! I am pregnant that too before marriage. Leave me! Leave me! - Sister! Sister! Leave me! Leave her! Let her do what she wants! What are you thinking? You are killing not only yourself. You are killing an innocent one too. Go ahead and jump. Jump! No! I can't do this! I can't do this! I can understand your pain. I can share your pain. Come. Come with me. Have a seat. Where is the child's father? I don't know. We met and then we got separated. I lost his address. Now where will I search for him in this big world? You will surely find him. But when? How long will I have to suffer and wait for him? Look at me. I got widowed at a age younger than yours. Still I am waiting. I am sure that I will find him. Not in this lifetime. Next lifetime. Sister is my mother. - Sister is my mother. Sister is my mother. - Sister is my mother. Sister is my mother. - Sister is my mother. Again you both are fighting! I am the mother to both of you. Sister! - Sister! - Sister! Sister, are all of these kids yours? None of them is mine. But they all are mine. I am everybody's mother. What are you all doing here! Run away! Go! It is a boy. - A boy. Wow! Look, what a pretty child. What is this? You are crying? Then what should I do? Celebrate? I don't know where he is. He doesn't know that I have given birth to a son. Not you, I have given birth to a son. I am his mother. Yes, I will raise him. - You have so many children. I will think that I have one more. Kids, come! Come! Look, your younger brother has arrived! Look! Look! Have you brought the ticket? - Yes. But when will your travels come to end? Take this. You know, Girdhari. I can't find the one I am searching for. God knows where she is. Till the time I don't find her, this journey won't end. Forget her. She must have got married by now. And she must have become a mother too. And she must be singing a lullaby for her child. "You are the apple of the stars' eyes." "You are lovelier than the reflection of the moon." "You will make the country proud." "You are the radiance of the heart and the eyes." "You are the apple of the stars' eyes." "You are the snap of love." "You are the snap of love." "I lost my heart and I found you." "You are the snap of love." "I lost my heart and I found you." "You are the memento of cherished memories." "Come, come in my lap." "You are the apple of the stars' eyes." "You are lovelier than the reflection of the moon." "You will make the country proud." "You are the radiance of the heart and the eyes."

Boss, thank you for escorting me home. Greetings. - Greetings. Son, come here. Look at this. I have got a new board. Banwarilal. - Girdharilal Sons. It is good. Son, now have a look there. Jacket Company. Father, what is this Jacket Company? Son, Jacket is the person who is opening the shop. And company is in the house. Father, this company won't work. - Why not, son? He had gone abroad along with some sir. He had gone as Jagatram. But he has returned as Jacketram. But father, he is so short. - You come with me. Strangers work in your shop. And you work with strangers. I want to ask you what does Nirmal.. ..give you that you can't find here. Father, car! You won't buy a car. And I won't stay here. Who is she, father? She is Jacket's company. Father, make me a servant of this company. What a beautiful company! What rubbish! - Nothing, father. I was wondering that you are right. Banwarilal Girdharilal sons. If there is no Banwarilal, then there won't be any Girdharilal. If Girdharilal doesn't stay here.. ..then where will the other sons come from? Then you will stay here only, won't you? Yes, father. I will stay here only. God bless you, son! God bless you! I will give an offering of 5 paisa to the Goddess. Did you like anybody? All of them are fine, sister-in-law. But what will I do seeing these snaps? I have told you the whole story. But your brother doesn't listen. Whom are you fooling, sister-in-law! Brother will not listen to you? The whole world says that you make.. ..the world renowned doctor dance to your tunes. You are a flatterer! This is not a lie. There really is a girl, sister-in-law. I love her. But I have lost her. I will find her, if I search for her. You couldn't find her hitherto. Then when will you find her? Your brother says to get Nirmal married soon. Even death sentence is not declared so soon. Sister-in-law, this is the matter of marriage. Nirmal! - Brother! Enough! When did you come? - Just now. You saw the snaps? Yes, brother. I told sister-in-law everything. What did Nirmal say? - What will Nirmal say? I did not like anyone of them. - None? What is the hurry for marriage? Nirmal is not an old man. Even you have not aged. Forget about me. But you do look very young. Hey! What are you doing behind the pillar! Good morning, Mr. Banwarilal. Your breakfast is over? I am not like you, Jacket sir. I will first go to the temple then I will have my breakfast. I see. Even I am waiting for someone. My first daughter has arrived. I am waiting for my 2nd daughter. Where are you? My dear! My darling! Dear, get pussy's breakfast here. - Yes, papa. My dear cat. Today I will have my breakfast with my pussy cat. Come on, pussy cat! Oh God! Jacket sir. - Yes. You eat the leftovers of the cat. - Of course. Why not! It is not an ordinary cat! It is a cat from abroad. She is a cat from abroad. And you are a donkey from abroad. What did you say! What did you say! I was praising you! - I see. Thank you. Thank you. What are you looking at? I was looking at the cat. - Cat? Be careful from the cat. They are soft, but their nails are very sharp. I hate cats! Especially this cat! Whenever I go out, it blocks my path. Some day I will break her legs. Karuna? Karuna! Karuna! Karuna! - Nirmal. Karuna - Nirmal! Stand like this. Let me look at you to my hearts content. I want to see what I had lost, what I have found. Karuna, I searched for you everywhere. Ask me too. How I spent my time. What is the use of asking? I have found you, I have found my world. Come, let us go to meet brother and sister-in-law. Wait for a while. I will just come. Where are you going? I want to show you something. I will just come. Suraj! Suraj, you know what your daddy will say when he sees you. He will say that Karuna, I had left a memento with you. And that memento is like this? Sit. Which one is good? This one. Isn't this good? - Yes. - Sure? What has happened to you, Karuna? You are dressing up Suraj like this? Sister, today no matter how much I dress him up.. ..it will be less. Today he is going to meet his father. Sister, he has come! - Congratulations, Karuna. But listen to me and don't take Suraj with you. Why? He has come after ages. That is what I am thinking. He will see such a grown up child after ages.. ..then what will he say? Sister! - Any person can have this doubt. No, sister! No! Nirmal will never doubt me. Nirmal is a human being. Lord Ram was a God. Lord did not doubt Sita. Even God was helpless before people's suspicion. And a Goddess like Sita was banished from the house. I don't mind the exile of Sita. But once I will surely make my son meet his father. Karuna! Before leaving at least think. What will happen if father refuses to accept his son? Do you know? What a child, who is doubted on, is called? Sister! - That's why I tell you. Let Suraj remain my son. Now you go that person for whom you were waiting.. ..and who is waiting for you. Son! Don't forget Karuna that Suraj is my son and he is your nephew. You are only his Aunt. - Only Aunt. Yes. Your whole life lies ahead of you. You try to decipher Nirmal's heart. If he agrees, then I will return your Suraj back to you. Where do you want to go, ma'am? You only say. What happened? Where is the thing that you wanted to show me? No, it is somebody else's memento. She said to leave behind your memento. You did the right thing. Today even I would have given anything. I have found you. What is the need of your memento? Have a seat. Why are you looking behind? The one who looks behind, he can never move ahead. The one who moves ahead, he never looks behind. Sit. Ma'am! Ma'am! Come and take your parcel! Your brother-in-law has sent it for you. My brother-in-law? - Yes, your brother-in-law. Where is it? - In the rickshaw. It is not here. - It is here only. You - I have brought a life sized portrait for you, sister-in-law. She is the one whom I was searching for. What are you doing? You really have got a beautiful portrait for me. Have some more. - No, you have it. My hunger got satiated when I saw your face. I feel like seeing you forever. May God bless your parents, who gave birth to you! I don't have parents. - So what? Am I nothing for you? Nattu! - Brother has come. Nattu! What's the matter, Janki! Nattu is nowhere.. You are just barging in! - What happened? I will just tell you. First go to your room. Did you like my sister-in-law? - She is very nice. I don't know how a mother is. Today I found it out. Now I have entered my room! Tell me, what's the matter? Nothing. My sister-in-law has come. - Sister-in-law? Yes. My sister-in-law. Your daughter-in-law and Nirmal's fiance. But when did Nirmal get engaged? - Today. Nirmal brought her. And I have accepted her. Great! You approve everybody! Didn't you approve me once? But I want to see daughter-in-law with my own eyes. Not at all! This house belongs to decent people. And she belongs to decent family. She won't be judged before marriage. But I am not going to weigh her with scales. But I should at least know who she is, where she stays.. ..whose daughter she is. She is my daughter. Heard that. I am her mother. If you are the girl's mother, then I am the girl's father. Before fixing the alliance, I want to talk openly. Then go ahead. And sit here. Fine. Tell me, where will Nirmal get married? Here! And this city! - Where? This house. - This house? Then who will give the bride away? I will do it. Why did you stop? Now ask how much dowry you will get. You will get 1 kilogram. Now tell me, what will you get? If you are being so kind hearted, then even I am not less. I will bring 2 kilograms. I will get 50 saris. - I will get 100 saris. I see! You will give 100 saris to the daughter-in-law. And you won't give me anything? - I will give you. What the daughter-in-law doesn't like, I will give that to you. Now I can see daughter-in-law. Not at all. After marriage. Did you see me before marriage? No. That's why I think why don't I marry again? With you. Now that I have seen you. "Tonight is the night of love's intoxication." "What is the moon?" "What is the moon? It is just the reflection of the bride." "The moon stole our heart." "A flower gave us love." "A glance weaved its magic on us." "A glance weaved its magic on us." "The moon stole our heart." "A flower gave us love." "A flower.." "A flower.." "The moon stole our heart." "The moon has stolen the color from your tresses." "A flower is rosy due to your cheeks." "Every star is today beating like the heart." "Every star is today beating like the heart." "When I have found the traveler." "When I have found the traveler." "Then destination is not far away." "The moon stole our heart." "A flower gave us love." "A flower.." "A flower.." "The moon stole our heart." "The sweat on the forehead." "Is it the glimmering pearl of love or a diamond?" "God has created with his own hands." "God has created with his own hands." "Descending from the sky.." "Descending from the sky, she is a gorgeous damsel." "The moon stole our heart." "A flower gave us love." "A flower.." "A flower.." "The moon stole our heart." "A flower gave us love." Take this, daughter-in-law. Now see her. Daughter-in-law is so gorgeous. Daughter-in-law's eyes are so precious. Nirmal, your brother has still not come. Here people have come to see the bride. And God knows what he is doing. Wait! I will go and see. You are puffing cigarette here. And there people have come to see the bride. Won't you come to see the daughter-in-law? I should actually go. - Then come. Help me to get up. There is a time for everything. God knows what you are up to! Listen! You are going to see the daughter-in-law. Won't you give her something? I will go empty handed. I will tell daughter-in-law that I am a poor man. I am your sister-in-law's servant. Sister-in-law's servant doesn't go empty handed. Wow! You are great! Brother has come! Daughter-in-law! First take the necklace and then show your face. So you don't trust me. Daughter-in-law, first I will give the necklace. Then I will see your face. Here is the necklace. Take this, daughter-in-law. I give you the honour of my family. Will you spend the whole night here? Won't you sleep? I was wondering why daughter-in-law fainted like this. This is what happens. Memories of the past and the fear of the future. What do men know! What it feels like to leave one house and go to another house. That is fine. But when I saw daughter-in-law.. ..I felt as if I have seen her before too. Great! This is what you told me after marriage. What did I tell you? - I have seen you before. What are you looking at? Even you are looking very radiant today. What is this? Does anybody cry in the bed adored with flowers? I have only seen thorns in this world. I am afraid of flowers. What are you saying? You sit in this bed adored with flowers. Then I won't see the thorns. I was wondering about that poor girl. - Who? Your friend? Yes. She fell in love with somebody. And he went away somewhere. He returned after 1 year. - Then what happened? He tells her to marry him. That girl doesn't know what to do. Tell her to immediately marry him. But a trivial matter occurred. She became pregnant before marriage. You call this a trivial matter? God knows who the father of that child is! She knows. She might be bluffing. I am not talking about others. I am talking about myself. I would have never believed her. Even if I believe her, what would I say to brother and sister-in-law? Let us assume that even they accept it. But what about the society? Karuna, we have to live in this world only. And this world is very cruel. Who is your friend? Forget it. God knows what I started talking about. I praise your heart that feels so much sympathy for others. And I did not even ask how you spent those days, Karuna. I managed to spend it. You only used to say that the one who looks behind.. ..he can't move ahead. And the one who moves ahead, he doesn't look back. What happened, Karuna? What were you afraid of? Like this sage, even Nirmal turned his back. Though father is alive, the son has become an orphan. Beware if you called my son as an orphan. You return to your home. Let Suraj live with his mother. Now I will see how she blocks my way! - Father, who? That Jacket's cat. Today I broke her leg. Father, you are progressing. Yesterday you killed a mouse and today you broke the cat's leg. Just wait and watch, son. That is what I am doing! Not there! Here! Here! My sweet cat! I will just take you to the vet. Who are you? - I.. What? I am the representative of protection of animals and birds. What is that? Whatever it is, it is very good. Our organization has received the news.. ..that a man has broken your cat's leg. Not a man! A brute! If I have my way, then I will break his leg! Surely. First tell me where is the patient? Patient? - I mean your cat. Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Here she is! That butcher took no pity on her! Hold her. I will.. examine her. Give her pulse. The pulse is fine. - But it is my pulse. So what? Even the cat is yours. I will check both of it together. Wow! The pulse shows that your leg will be fine. My leg? I mean.. your cat's leg. But she has another ailment. Another ailment? - Dangerous ailment. Loneliness. Take this, I have bandaged her. You are so kind. For me, there is no difference between bird and animal. There is no difference between a child and a cat. You bring her to the park tomorrow. I will bring her friend. Friend will meet friend. And the loneliness will disappear. Who are you? What are you? I am the representative of protection of animals and birds. Representative.. animals and birds.. what is that? You can ask that from your daughter. Greetings. Dear, what is this representative of birds and animals? What is this? - Papa, even I don't know what it is. But whatever it is, it is very good. "Tonight is the intoxication of love.." Janki, button this. What would you do without me? Would you go with open buttons? That's why I don't allow you to go anywhere. Even if you go to your maternal house.. ..I call you within 2 days. Come, daughter-in-law. Come. No, today I will drink tea prepared by daughter-in-law. Take this, daughter-in-law. You only make it. What are you looking at? Take this tea. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law, look at this. Your laundryman has again broken my button. Whenever I send my clothes.. Even he has learnt from your habit. - How come? God knows whether the laundryman broke it or.. Go, daughter-in-law. Button it for him. Go. Go and let her put the button. Wow! What tea! There is sweetness in daughter-in-law's hands. That is fine. But the way you were staring at your daughter-in-law.. ..what will people say if they see it. I am sure that I have seen daughter-in-law somewhere. If I get a pill for doubt, then I will get it for you. If you find a friend, then your loneliness will go away. If you scratch with your nails, then no girl will talk to you. Here is your pussy's friend, Tom. He is Tom? He is so thin. What do I tell you? He fell in love with a cat. And she has eloped with some other cat. Since then he has given up eating. He remains sad during daytime. And he sings sad songs during night. What are you looking at? They are meeting for the first time. But it seems like they have already met countless times before. Even I felt the same. - When? When I saw you for the first time. You might not know that my house is opposite yours. And your house.. - Is opposite my house. Yes. I saw you and.. - I fell in love with you. Yes. - What if I say no? Then I.. - Will die. - Yes. Tell me one thing. Why do you stammer on M letter? I don't have a.. mother. So I stammer on M letter. But I don't stammer when I sing. "Mama, mama, mama." Did I stammer? - No. "Tonight.." Champa, serve dinner. "Tonight.." Where is Janki? - She has gone to the theater. Then she will be here soon. I completely forgot. She had brought the ticket. - Yes. How did she go? On horse carriage? No, on her legs. I liked your joke. Listen! - Here she comes. Come, come, Janki. Nowadays you go out alone? I had to go. I had brought the tickets. I couldn't come. - Its good that you did not come. Otherwise I would not have been able to cry properly. You cried? - The story was such. One guy meets a girl. They both fell in love. And the girl went away. - Not the girl, the guy goes away. It is one and the same thing. Listen to the rest. The girl waited for him. But both of them could not meet. - I will tell you the rest. She became pregnant before marriage. This is what happened. Yes! But how do you know? I was just guessing. Everybody becomes pregnant after marriage. But stories are not made. We don't cry for it. Karuna, we feel like crying later on. Not on the mother, but on that child. As soon as he was born, his mother.. ..left him in the orphanage. She herself got married. She got everything. A good family, a loving husband, all joys of the world. But everything was snatched from that poor child. Mother's love, father's love. God knows what a mother she must be! What happened? Why did daughter-in-law starting crying? I am crying on the fate of that mother. She found a good family, a loving husband.. ..the joys of the world and everything. Still she has nothing. Nothing. Karuna! Strange puzzle! Hello. - Hello. Hello. What! What! What is this! What is this! What is this! Papa, there was a worm. Here it goes. - Sure? - Yes. A worm! Hello. How is your pussy? She is fine. But she can't sleep. Even you are awake. - What to do? I can't sleep. Even my plight is the same. I can't sleep, I can't sit. There is no peace. You are coming in the park with your pussy, aren't you? Yes. Even pussy will come. Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Oh God! Whom are you searching for, Jacket sir? My pussy is missing since yesterday. I am so worried. - Shall I tell you, Jacket sir? Quickly go to the police station and lodge a complaint. The world is bad. Somebody might have eloped with pussy. What! - Yes. Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! What are you searching for? - My pussy. She is missing? - She left house last night. Now it is afternoon time, and she has still not returned. Even my Tom has not returned. Then it is scarier. No need to fear. In fact, it is good news. Both might have gone to start a family. They are animals, not humans. They don't need any band, or clarinets. Neither palanquin nor horses. No bangles and no vermillion. Their eyes locked and their hearts united. And their marriage ceremony was over. Understood? I understood. But who will explain to papa? This is the custom of the world. Parents themselves don't understand. They only try to explain to their children. You! You want to explain to your father! Jacket sir! Jacket sir! I did not find your pussy. But your daughter is here. Run away! Wait! Where are you running away! Where will you escape! Beware if you ever met him! Or glanced over there! I was sleeping and you were talking to him on the phone! And you said papa, it is a worm. Remember! I am a pure Indian when it comes to this matter! Take this. Deliver it to Ghanshyam's shop. It is so heavy. Son, I have only placed the bundles. But my father used to place the whole shop on my head. But father, Ghanshyam's shop is so far away. It is far away, but it is in this city only. I used to travel to other cities, with the.. ..whole shop lying on my head. Be careful! - Father, you are old bones. Will you now leave, or will you only talk! Be careful! Friend, do me a favour. Kill me. - Why? Are you fed up of life? I am fed up of life.. and marriage too. Can anybody get tired of life? There are two kinds of marriages. - Be careful. The first one.. what your brother did for you. - Yes. And the other one.. what my father is doing. Your father is getting married? No, he wants to get me married. - That's good. What is so good! I love a girl. - Yes. And father loves money. I am going to get married to money, not a girl. Then why don't you raise your voice against this injustice? I wanted to do that, buddy. But.. let me sit down. - Sit, sit. Hold this. Once upon a time, even I used to drive this vehicle with pride.. ..as a driver. But now father has made me a donkey from a driver. I will escort you. Hitherto only humans used to sit in this vehicle. Today I will escort a donkey too. Come. - Let's go. What a carburetor! The luggage is ready. What is this, Karuna? Don't you know? We met after ages. We were together just for few days. Then we again departed. When will I come to your place? When the house will be ready. Nirmal! Quickly come downstairs! What happened? Why are you shouting? What is he doing upstairs? He has to catch his train. Nirmal! Brother, coming! No. I have told you before too. I like smiling moonlight. Not tears. What happened! Do you want to die! Sir, I beg you! Run your car over me! But why do you want to die? My beloved is getting married to somebody else! I don't want to live! Run your car over me! - Get up! Let me die! I want to die! Run your car over me! Stop! Stop this marriage! This marriage can't happen! Doctor, you? She is with you? She is your daughter-in-law and your son's bride. Bride? Fear God, doctor. She is the bride. My daughter. Your daughter is just a fistful of wealth that Banwari wants. Bride is the one, who is chosen by the groom.. ..and whom he loves. I ask the groom. Who is your bride? She or she? I just know.. that he is my father. And I am getting married to wealth not a bride. Heard that? - You listen to me! You keep quiet! Come, dear! You will marry this girl only! Get up, dear. Priest, start the mantas. I will see how this marriage takes place. I will see how this marriage will not take place. This is injustice! God bless you! Banwari, you too bless your daughter-in-law and son. Doctor, you have fooled me. I will not spare you. Go ahead. First bless them. Bless me, father. - Your father is dead! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations to you for your daughter's marriage! What nonsense! Impossible! You? And married to him? I will teach you a lesson! Come on! Papa! - Come on! Darling! Where are you going! I will not spare you! I will lock you up, so that you forget her face! Come! Come! Come! I will see how you will meet her. I have put a strong lock. It is unbreakable. Dear, you had gone to marry! Let me see, shameless! How you venture out of the house! If you venture out, then you will have to cross my dead body. On my dead body! My name is Jacketram! Jacketram! I don't think anybody ever had such a wedding night. Bride is there and the groom is here. Brother becomes suspicious again and again. And I always change the topic. And I escape. But how long? Some day I will surely be caught. I am afraid. You are afraid of yourself, not others. Like how people are afraid of their.. ..own shadows during night time. Aunt! Aunt! Now what is there to fear? Suraj is my son. Tomorrow is my son's birthday. And you have to come. Will you come? Will you come? - Yes. Karuna! You are sitting here! And he has raised chaos in the whole house! My head is paining, sister-in-law. If your head is paining, then have a pill. Dr. Banerjee had come. It is his son's birthday. And he said to bring daughter-in-law. You guys go, sister-in-law. - You will have to come! No, sister-in-law! I will stay at home. You guys go. - Fine. Banerjee, why are you shouting? We will be there soon. Even daughter-in-law is coming. Daughter-in-law is not coming. - Why? Her head is paining. - Her head is paining? What is this? Sometimes daughter-in-law's head is paining. Sometime she faints! I think daughter-in-law is an enigma. Every woman is an enigma. Everybody has headache and everybody faints. Haven't I ever fainted? Yes, you have. But not right now. Banerjee is shouting. Let's go. "Seeing the flowers I will spend my life." "Seeing the flowers I will spend my life." "May you live as long as there are stars in the sky." ''Seeing the flowers l will spend my life.'' ''May you live as long as there are stars in the sky.'' "May you get a bride as lovely as the flowers." "May you live on forever." "You are the eyes of the stars." "You are more beautiful than the vision of the moon." "Even the threshold of the earth is on you." "You are the brightness of my eyes." "You are the eyes of the stars." Has master come back as yet? - No, madam. Daughter-in-law, how are you? How is your headache? It's better now. I slept as soon as you'll left. You did a good thing. Rest is the treatment for all the diseases. Daughter-in-law's bag, it was in the rickshaw. Daughter-in-law, you said that you were sleeping? You went sleeping in the rickshaw.. ..and forgot your purse as well. That means that the headache was an excuse. For not going to the birthday party. Tell me daughter-in-law, where had you gone? Where had you gone? - I'll tell you where she went. She had gone to the market, to get some medicines. You don't understand. - Come on, let's go. I mean to say.. - I know what you want to say. You create mountains out of molehills. This is not a small thing, sister-in-law. You don't know how big this is. What do you know, how far the heart reaches? Who is it? - I'm Saira Bano. Saira Bano? - If you don't know who Saira Bano is then.. ..you won't even recognise your father tomorrow. I'm dead, come here. Who is this veil clad female? Father, this is my friend. She is very tall. And this is my father. - He is very short. I'm going to the shop. Entertain.. ..your friend well, okay. I'll entertain myself. Your friend has a masculine voice? The thing is father, there is no son in my family. So my parents have brought me up as a son. Yes, and that's why her voice is masculine. Okay, possible. Now get your veil off. What have you done? I had only two options, either I were a sari and sit at home. Or I were a veil and come over here. Do you have a good veil? - Of course. Show him a good veil. We have such veils that you won't find in whole of India. Did you find it? - No, sir. It was there yesterday and now it's not there, that's weird. Sit down, sir, I'll go and get it. I'm still amazed at your guts. When people go to war they tie the death cloth and leave. Tell me what's the difference between.. ..a veil and a death cloth? There is no veil in the house and no son in the house. The veil will be where my son is. Lala, where are you going? - To find my son. In my house? - What nonsense? There is a decent veil clad girl sitting over there. Not a decent girl but a decent father's.. ..indecent veil clad son is sitting over there. Nonsense, nonsense. - Go up and see for yourself. Oh my God. - Okay, run, run. Quick. Where is your friend, daughter? She went away, father. What? She left? I'm coming from the stairs. Did she fly away? - I'll show you. See over there, there she is going. Shall I take the luggage, sir? - Yes, keep it in the cat. Did you take daughter-in-law's luggage? - No. Take that also. Daughter-in-law's not come. Why? Daughter-in-law's head is paining. Again? What is this? Whenever she has to come.. ..out with us her head starts paining. It happened the other day as well. I think that there is some secret which.. ..she fears will come out in front of us. I also feel that whenever we leave for somewhere.. ..daughter-in-law also goes out. The mistake is ours only. We didn't ask her name or caste. We just agreed to all this. She says she doesn't have any parent's. Or brothers and sisters. I know that she is an orphan. But before getting married there must be.. ..some place where she would have stayed. At least someone knows something about them! We made a big mistake by not enquiring about her. Thank God that things don't work your way. Otherwise you would put the entire C.I.D behind her. But still we should at least know who she is. I'll tell you who she is, she is your daughter-in-law. Your son's bride, my daughter and the wealth of this house. She is a Goddess, and you don't doubt a Goddess. What are you seeing? I 'm.. seeing your progress. I still remain a doctor but you are becoming.. ..a Goddess from a wife. If you go at this speed and I go at this.. ..speed then what will happen to this world. Nothing will happen to the world, our train will leave. Come on. You're going to your mother's place that's why. Come on. Come on, once again, eleven, twelve.. ..thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.. Sister? - Karuna, how are you? Sister, brother and sister-in-law have gone out for two.. ..days, I'll stay here for a couple of days. With you and Suraj. But if the doctor comes to know? He won't come to know, let me.. ..stay in heaven for two days, only for two days. Let me quench my hunger and thirst. Life will become easy then. Ok fine. Suraj, look who has come, your aunt. Not aunt, say mother, sister, say mother. Let me remain his mother for two days. Let the injuries that I have, be cured and reduce. Oh my dear! Greetings, doctor. - How are you, Banwari? Not fine, I've been waiting for two days. - Nattu? You know that I don't go to another doctor. And there was no one over here to tell me where you.. ..have gone and when you will return. Why, Nattu, daughter-in-law and.. ..the servants were over here. Nattu had gone to the market, daughter-in-law gave.. ..all the servants holiday and went somewhere for two days. Went somewhere? Where did she go for two days? What do I know, doctor? You have so many relatives, friends in this city. She must have gone to someone's place. Where are you going, doctor? My medicine? Later. You? Are you coming now? No, I came one day before and I knew.. ..that you were not at home for two days. Come, sit. Why did you stop? Come inside? Sit, Karuna you will have to tell me today, who are you? Will I have to tell you that I am your daughter-in-law? I doubt even that. Daughter-in-laws don't behave like this. They don't go away from the house for two days. Where do they go, what do they do, no one knows.. I had gone to see Sen's place. Who are Sen's? Where does she live? Name them. I see that you are trying to make up a story. So many people have come and tried to make a story. The place where you are sitting. At this same place a few years back a girl had.. What is this? I know that you are trying to hide something from me. Today I am going to find out what the truth is. Tell me Karuna! Brother? - How did you come suddenly? On leave, I took a letter from the doctor and came. All doctors aren't like you. Why haven't you gone to the clinic yet? - I have to see some patients first. You.. you take Karuna and go. - Let's go, Karuna. Dear, I'll put a thread from here to there. The thread has to be weak. Yes the thread is weak but the rope will be strong. From the front we can only speak to each other. But from the rope we can come close to each other. But my father and your father both are sleeping down. Let them sleep and let us meet. Lala, are you seeing what I'm seeing. Oh yes! Are you seeing what I am seeing? Look at that, take care of your son. You go and take care of your daughter. What are you doing, father? You have embarrassed me, so now I'm cutting the rope. Father, the knife is very blunt, like you. Wait, I'll show you how blunt this knife is. Father? Thanks. Father, now we are going to run away. Come on, come on! Lala, now we are in real trouble. "Love is very sweet, love is very sweet." "What does the world know that we are.. ..lovers, we are carefree and crazy about you."

Dr. Verma speaking, sister, what happened? There is a child at my place who is very unwell. Why, what happened? - He has a lot of fever. Okay, I'll come immediately. Sister, some people have the hobby of.. ..collecting photos and some of collecting toys. You have the hobby of collecting kids. Are there any better photos or toys than kids in the world? That is the truth, sister. Why don't you also adopt such a toy? Turn around, son. Cough. - Cough. Cough, son. - Cough, son. - Okay, like this. I feel like coughing, sister. I told the child to cough, he's telling me to cough. Then? - Then what, I coughed and the child.. ..coughed and we both started to cough. That kid. You are laughing very much today. From the time you have come to this house.. ..there is happiness everywhere. Here, keep my coat. Why should I keep your coat in my bag? Even I am yours. Nirmal, it's time for you to leave. Sister-in-law, I'm ready since when, it's because of her. Huh! Let's go. Yes, yes. Let's go. Keep my bag in the car. Bag is here but where they are? They are coming. Let me tell you one thing, Nirmal. You went to the mountains for your honeymoon. What was I to do? Sister-in-law forced me to go. Did you see how dumb your brother is? Like you only he also doesn't have a tongue in his mouth. Let's go. - How come you are so happy today, brother? I met this one kid who was so funny. Do you remember that we had been here before? And we had crossed the bridge also. The bridge is broken. And I had the same question in my eyes. And I was reading the fear in your eyes. And you were trying to get away from me. That is the real thing. Each and every time there used to be tears in your eyes. Not tears, but drops of water. What are you seeing? The drops of water on your cheeks. In those drops a small stream, in the stream a small boat. And in the boat, the both of us. What happened? - Nothing, can we go back? Where? Near to home. Why, till yesterday you wanted to come over here. Why are you talking for go there? I think something is wrong. Sometimes you go away... ... and sometimes you come near. I don't know. I just want to go home. Have you come back, master? - Yes, I've come. Have you come back, Nirmal? - Yes, I've come. Have you come back, Nirmal? - Yes, I've come. Have you come back, Nirmal? - Yes, I've come. Oh brother? - What happened, why are you so angry? What is happening in this house, brother? Everyone is running about here and there. Don't you know, your sister-in-law has had a child? A child! - Yes, child. But, so soon? - What do you mean so soon? I mean a few days back, sister-in-law was alright. She's alright now as well, come daughter-in-law. From where did you get him? He's a very beautiful boy. Why, am I not beautiful? What happened? What happened, Karuna, whenever.. ..you see a child you start to cry. And you start to shiver. When I saw the kid, I thought of it's mother. I'm crying on that mother's destiny. Who could give birth to the son but could.. ..not have the peace of having a son. And I think of sister-in-law, who didn't go through the.. ..pain of having a son, but has the peace of caring for one. Go.. move aside a horse is coming, move aside a horse is coming. Move aside a horse is coming, Move aside a horse is coming, tell uncle to move aside. A horse is coming. - That's good, brother. Here, I moved out of the way. Ok. Tell aunt to move out of the way, horse is coming.. Aunt move out, horse is coming. Maternal aunt, move a horse is coming. - Not maternal.. ..aunt, aunt. - Not aunt, maternal aunt. - Listen, son. Now the horse is very tired. Go outside and play. Go, go. Here take this. That's weird.. Why? What happened? ..the child called daughter-in-law.. ..maternal aunt and not aunt. You keep doubting over everything. You should have been in the police. You would have become an inspector by now. It's fine. What about kids, they call mother as maternal aunt and maternal aunt, aunt. You sit. You read. During the winter, during the summer. And what else? Children, all of you can go now. What has happened, Karuna? Such a thing has happened that I can't call you sister. What have I done? First you made me maternal aunt from mother. And now from maternal aunt, you made me aunt. The person I wanted to forget, you got him into my house. I did all this for you. - For me? If you had a son and if he called you aunt.. ..then I would ask you how a mother's heart feels. Mother's heart? You already became a mother? Suraj has already become your son? Did you forget the day that you were.. ..going to jump off the roof? You were going to give up your life. And take your son's life as well. Today your chest is exploding like a volcano. Where had the mother's milk dried at that time? No, no! Suraj is just a part of you but I have.. ..cared for him like a piece of my heart. Whosever house I keep him, wherever I.. ..give him, I have my right on him. Whatever I have done, I have thought and done. I have done it for Suraj, for you. Along with mother's love a child also.. ..needs a father's caring. Suraj will get all that. A mother like your sister-in-law, father like the doctor. An aunt like you. Again the same thing? Whatever they had asked for they got, what did I get? I will pray for only this that your sister-in-law has a son.. ..and you will get a beautiful daughter. Yes, a daughter. Hmm. Is this hot water for me? - No, sir. This water is going for master Suraj's bath. Can you iron my clothes? My hands aren't empty, I have to iron.. ..master Suraj's clothes. At least give me a cup of tea? I have to prepare breakfast for master Suraj. Master Suraj, what is this? What happened, Suraj? What happened, Nirmal? Why are you shouting? I've come to say that I'm leaving. - Why? What happened? From the time he has come in this house.. ..I'm worth nothing in this house. Are you jealous of Suraj? A small kid? He is a kid but I'm not. Who says that? But for me both of you are my children. Then feed me breakfast. - That's it. Come, come.. sit. Here. I will not eat like this. - Then how will you eat? The way he is eating. Oh! You are smaller than him. Here. Look, Nirmal, I listened to you now you have to listen to me. - What say! After two days is the festival of Lord Krishna. Stay over here till the festival gets over. That's it, such a small thing? I'll stay. You've made him agree to one thing. Now ask him another thing as well. When should we celebrate your darling's birthday? 15th March. - 15th March? You said 15th March as if he was really born on 15th March. I was born on that day. Listen to me sister-in-law, keep his.. ..birthday also on Lord Krishna's birthday. Just the way that Lord Krishna was born in Kansa's prison.. ..and came and played in Yashoda's courtyard. In the same way Suraj has come to your house. Which mother gave birth to him. And which mother cares for him. "You have come like the flower in the spring." "Like this is the season of love." "There is a noise in the whole world." "That you have come like a new day in the spring." "There is a noise in the whole world." "Every where is happiness." "You are the eyes of the stars." "You are more beautiful than the vision of the moon." "Even the threshold of the earth is on you." "You are the brightness of my heart and of the city." "You are the eyes of the stars." "When you were away from me you were still close to me." "In this world everyone has their own destiny." "When you were away from me you were still close to me." "In this world everyone has their own destiny." "In the swing in my mind whom should I swing?" "You are my darling, Kanhaiya." "You are the eyes of the stars." "You are more beautiful than the vision of the moon." "Even the threshold of the earth is on you." "You are the brightness of my heart and of the city." "You are the eyes of the stars." Sir? - Yes. Good. Nirmal, you are getting the quarters to stay. You can now take daughter-in-law and settle there. At least now leave us alone man. Sister-in-law, I have got the quarters. Are you happy now? Then get ready to pack and leave. Go. Sister-in-law. During festival's, one is supposed to give away something. Can I also ask for something today? Yes, why not? Can I take you darling, at my place to stay for few days? Yes, take him. He is first your son and then mine. That is true. Come, come madam, it's a brand new.. Karuna, you go home, I'll meet Girdhari and come. Let's go, driver. Is Girdhari not at the shop? Are you coming now, Nirmal sir? After everything is said and done! Why, what happened? Girdhari ran away, for this jacketed girl.. ..he left his father crying and left. - That's a good thing. The only regret is that it happened a little late. A little late? Now I understood, both you.. ..brothers have hatched this plot together. Nirmal sir, I had to ask you one thing. Yes. Who was that lady with you in the car? Beware, Banwari! That is my wife. Wife? I thought it was something else. - What something? Let it be, it just slipped out of my mouth. And you are good at catching a thief. I need to know. Didn't the doctor tell you anything? He knew everything. Let it be, if the doctor didn't tell you then why should I? Banwari, tell me or else I'll strangle your neck. Take it easy.. Nirmal sir. Only if you leave my neck, can I tell you. Tell me fast or else I'll go mad. It is something to get mad about. I have seen your wife long ago. When she was still unmarried and she.. ..was going to become a mother. - Banwari! At least listen where I saw her. - Where did you see her? At your brother's clinic, if you don't.. ..believe me go and ask your brother. Go and ask him what was she doing.. ..over there with him before marriage. Sir, there is a patient sitting inside. I have come to ask you one thing. Nirmal, you can see that I'm not alone. Even I have not come alone, there is a question in my.. ..heart that is killing me inside till I get the.. ..answer to my question. Can you excuse us for a minute? Tell me, what happened? I want to ask you whether Karuna.. ..had come to you before marriage? If she had come, then in which condition had she come? Tell me, brother, then in which condition had she come? I fall at your feet. Nirmal, there is one relation between brothers. And one between a doctor and his patient. And a doctor never tells things about his patients to others. You can go. Every doctor has a fee. I'll take that fee. Go away from here. Go. Brother, you don't know at this time.. Nirmal. Are you sleepy, Karuna? Go, go and sleep. Even you are awake, waiting for brother-in-law. And Nirmal must be waiting over there for you. Go, go and sleep. Go. Did you not sleep as yet? No, I cannot get sleep. I remembered a friend's story. Which friend's story? There is a friend of mine who fell in love with this girl. One day he had to go somewhere. Many years had gone by when he returned. Did the girl get the boy? Yes, and they even got married. He left a nice girl. But then he came to know that she used to go to the doctor. Tell me, Karuna, why did you do this? I loved and cared so much for you. And what did I get in return? You don't even die. Nirmal? Nirmal? Nirmal? 'I'm sorry, brother, I gave you a lot of pain and sufferings.' 'I should not have come and asked you like that.' 'I had already come to know about everything.' 'From Banwari.' From Banwari? Come and eat food before it gets cold. I'm not hungry. - You are not hungry? Even daughter-in-law is saying the same thing. What is happening in this house? Nirmal also left without seeing me, without telling me. Daughter-in-law is sitting over there upset. Even you are sitting upset. I'm a member of this family, tell me at least something. Janki, there are some things that.. Hello, Dr. Varma, yes, I'll be there. I have to go to the clinic, it's an emergency. Nattu. - Yes, sir. Remove the car. Go away at this moment, Suraj. My head is paining very badly. Let me press your head, the pain will go away. Is it okay, aunt? Yes, son. As soon as you touched me all my pain went away. Come on, come on. Let's go and play. Won't your mother get angry if we play? We'll close our eyes, we won't be able to see her. Come on, come on. - Yes. - Come on. I'll come, son, but once call aunt as mother. How can aunt be mother? She can be. Just the way mother can.. ..be aunt, even an aunt can be mother. Say, say mother. - Mother. - Son. - Mother. What I heard? What I heard? "What has happened to me?" "My crazy heart is dancing all over." "I have started to fly in the sky." "What have I heard all of a sudden." "What has happened to me?" "In the flowers your face is hidden." "Your cheeks are like the morning sunrise." "In the flowers your face is hidden." "Your cheeks are like the morning sunrise." "Even the seasons are feeling different to me now." "What has happened to me?" "My crazy heart is dancing all over." "The clouds of happiness have started to accumulate." "The winds have started to blow like the sounds of an anklet." "The clouds of happiness have started to accumulate." "The winds have started to blow like the sounds of an anklet." "I have conscience no longer, no longer." "What has happened to me?" "My crazy heart is dancing all over." "When the rains come like this, love also showers." "The cold and naughty winds, the season begins to sing." "Come to my arms, my darling." "What has happened to me?" "What has happened to me?" "What has happened to me?" "What has happened to me?" "My crazy heart is dancing all over." Nattu, get water in this, fast. - Yes, madam. Did you get the time to come now? - Why? What happened? Suraj has got fever, his whole body has begun to shiver. Come, and see him. Get it here. He is still unconscious. - 105. - 105. I hope he didn't go out in the rains to play. He had gone with daughter-in-law to play in the rains. Daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law, I beg you to never do this with my child. If you had your own kid you would come to know. And you also listen, Janki, after today see to it that.. ..daughter-in-law doesn't touch my child. Nirmal, you? We travelled in the.. ..same train and yet we didn't meet. It happens sometimes. Have you come all alone? I thought now that you have got the quarters.. ..you will get your wife along as well. Wife? No I have come alone. It's okay, then come over to my house. Come on, you are feeling shy like a woman. Are you shy of my wife? Neelu, this is my friend Nirmal. We both work for the same company. Me and Nirmal. Nirmal? - Do you know each other? How can I not know him? He is the same person who left my.. ..friend Karuna and ran away. I don't even want to hear Karuna's name. The thing that she did with me.. - And the thing you did to her? Forgive me, Kailash, I am leaving from here. Where are you going? If you don't like it then Neelu.. ..will not speak about Karuna. I will speak about Karuna. I have.. seen her suffer, he hasn't. She had lost her father and she was going.. ..to become the mother of your child. What does a man know what happens to.. ..an unmarried mother? Even you don't know. 'I need to tell you a small thing.' 'I'm going to be the mother of your child before marriage.' 'You call that a small thing.' 'What do you know whose child it is?' 'But at least I know whose it is.' 'That can even be a made up story.' 'And I don't believe in stories.' 'I will never believe it, even if I do then what.. ..am I going to tell brother and sister-in-law?' 'Whether they agree or not, how are we.. ..going to tell the whole society and the city. I'll explain to the society, and to brother and sister-in-law. Mother, mother, mother, mother.. Don't worry, son. - Mother. Your mother is next to you. You are not my mother, no, no. Sister has not come as yet? She must be on her way. Her she is. - No.. Mother, mother.. Suraj? - Mother, mother.. Suraj son, looks your mother has come. You also are not my mother. - Mother, mother.. Mother, mother.. Mother, mother.. My son. - Mother.. Mother, mother.. Tell me Lord, what should I do? - Mother, mother.. Even though I want to go to him, how do I go? Mother, mother, mother, mother. Mother, mother.. Mother, mother.. Mother, mother.. Mother. - Who knows how is his mother? From where do we get her? Mother, mother. - Son. Mother, mother. Mother! - Son. Mother, mother. Son, I'm coming, son. Mother, mother. Son, I'm coming, son. Beware, daughter-in-law, if you touch my son! Your son? Even I can tell you the same thing. Don't touch my son. - Suraj, son, your mother has come. Son. Mother, mother. My darling, today your mother has come to you. Are you Suraj's mother? What are you saying? Do you still doubt me? Then cut my heart.. ..and see how a mother bleeds for her child. Sister, what is she saying? Is it true? Why are you asking sister, ask me. I have kept Suraj in my womb for nine months. And made him able enough so that you could adopt him. No, Karuna, no, don't say anything more. If not for you, at least for Suraj keep quiet. No sister, I can't keep quite now. I have kept this volcano in my heart for long enough. Do you want to ask me something else? I don't want to ask you, I want to tell you something. You have taken revenge on this doctor.. ..and also of Janki who cared for you like a sister. And you came and put this sin on her lap. Pick up this sin and leave from here. Leave from here, now. What are you doing? Why are you removing daughter-in-law.. ..from the house? She is the wealth of this house. Wealth of this house. - I was the wealth of this house. Not any longer. When one man.. ..doubts another, this is what happens. Even if I sit on fire, he is not going to believe me. Let me go away. - You will not go alone, Karuna. Nirmal? - Even I will leave this house with you. Before you leave, I want to know what.. ..she had come to me for before marriage. Who's sin was she carrying when she came to me? I'll tell you, today I'm ready to tell you everything. I'm ready to leave this house, I'm ready.. ..to even lose this heaven. To get all this I gave away the piece of my heart, my son. I know, Karuna, I know everything now. I didn't know all this before. You still don't know anything, Nirmal. Your sister-in-law just adopted him but she gave birth to him. Tell me who is your partner in committing this sin. The sinner is standing in front of you. You! My brother, my son. - Yes. I'm your brother, your son and a human being too. All humans are not God like you, they are not stone. Come on, Karuna. Go. Nirmal, I can forget that I have a brother and a son. Now even I won't stay here anymore. Today you doubted daughter-in-law. - Tomorrow you will doubt your wife. Only God can test humans and you are not God. Maybe that's why God didn't give you a son. Otherwise then you would doubt him also. 'Do you think that your blood is of sin?' 'Then the sinner is standing in front of you.' You listened! 'Only God can test humans and you are not God.' 'Maybe that's why God didn't give you a son.' 'Otherwise then you would doubt him also.' Nirmal.. come here. Agreed that you have grown up. But you haven't grown up so much that you can leave.. ..without taking your brother's blessings. Brother? Daughter-in-law, where are you.. ..taking the child and going? I am going nowhere. Sister-in-law, aunt's right on the child is.. ..more than the mother's. And father's is more than the uncle. Why, Nirmal? Here, take care of your son. Not mine, our son. - Suraj is everyone's. "I will spend all my life seeing the flowers." "I will spend all my life seeing the flowers." "May you live as long as there are stars in the sky." "I will spend all my life seeing the flowers." "May you live as long as there are stars in the sky." "May you get a very beautiful bride." "May you live on and on forever."
