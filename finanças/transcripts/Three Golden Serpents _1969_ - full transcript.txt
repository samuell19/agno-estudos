Look at that! - They're bred especially for fighting. But the real winner is the loser... ...because the Thais believe it may be reborn in a superior form. No one here fears death because reincarnation is part of their philosophy. Look at them go at each other. Who is that? Fights can't begin without the permission of Madam Kim Soo. It's because she owns the arena. I've had enough mother, I can't take it anymore. This is the river I was telling you about, the Maenam. It's very fascinating. Excuse me, what are they doing there? There on the bank? They're giving food to a beggar. In this country it's the custom to share with the poor. All men, even the king, live for a certain time on the kindness of others. Tell me, what sort of store is that? - That's the general store. Bangkok is known as the Venice of the Orient. So people trade the goods they have for items they need by boat. An interesting analogy. You'd be surprised at the volume of business they do, and the profit they're making. Oh look at the little girl there. Hello there! They're so shy. I wish I'd brought my camera. It's just as well you didn't. They'd have charged you to pose. My goodness, really? And over there is the old market where they sell everything imaginable. You can get some good buys, too. You have to bargain for them though. - Look, the kids are swimming there. And there's the dock. I think we get off the boat here. Give me a hand will you? Lady, Lady. Like to buy the nice birds that fly away for good luck? It's a custom here. When you set the birds free, you make a wish. Your act of kindness... ...makes the wish come true. - Oh, really? Sure. You make a wish, and open the cage, and the wish'll be granted. Go on, try it. Close your eyes. That's it. Why not try it, Mrs. Leighton? - I'd love to. Where's Phyllis gone? Phyllis? I suppose she went shopping. She's probably wandering around. - Phyllis, dear? Officer, my daughter is missing. Where can she be? I can't find my daughter. You will help us, won't you? She's my daughter. Here. Fast! Faster! Faster! Get going! Chang. You know what you're supposed to do with her, don't you? I hope you do your best, this one's a prize catch. You'd better take good care of her. She'll bring a lot of dough The boss'll be pleased. I'll do the best I can, and maybe he'll be satisfied with us. Good. Hello. The average criminal uses a wide range poisons. Here in the Orient the preparation of poison is an art based on a long tradition. Doctor, poison isn't the main problem. The problem is to catch the criminal... ...to discover his motives. Why a man turns to crime. Who do you work for, Mr. Landru? The French Institute for Asian Studies. I'm a sort of advisor to them on legal affairs... ...yet criminology is my first love. That's why I've been invited to this conference. Being a French Asian I am a useful observer of people, their tradition. I guess you might call me an expert on the Orient. Captain Rowland! Captain Rowland! Phone call for Captain Rowland. Captain Rowland! Captain Rowland! That's me. What is it? - You're wanted in the lobby. A Mrs. Leighton wants to speak with you. It's urgent, I doubt it. Tell her I'm busy. Sir, she said it's very important. Alright, tell her I'll come. Excuse me, gentlemen, for breaking of our talk. The lady's one of the rich Americans I met in the hotel lobby this morning. I suppose she lost her cigarettes somewhere. I'll be right back. Oh, at last, Captain Rowland. Something terrible has happened. Phyllis, my daughter, has disappeared. She was right beside me when she vanished... ...in the market in the old part of town. Won't you please try to find her, Captain Rowland? I'm sorry, Mrs. Leighton, but I'm in no position to help you. I'm only a tourist in Thailand. It's not my business. But I'm sure the local police will do everything they can for you. Please don't bring the police into this. Let's find out what the trouble is... ...and then call them in , if we have to, later on. What if she's been kidnapped. Call the police and they might kill her. Now what about using a private detective. I don't care how much it costs. Now didn't you mention a Kommissar X, the one named Josseph Walker? Can he help us? Kommissar X! Oh, not again! Not him! Hello. - Suite 13? Yes. - I have a long distance call for Mr. Jo Walker. It's for you, my dear. Yes, Jo Walker here. One moment, Mr. Walker. I have a call from overseas for you. A Mrs. Leighton. I'll connect you through. Hello, Mr. Walker? Yes, this is Mrs. Leighton. I've spoken with Captain Rowland. We're waiting for you in Bangkok. Yes. Something awful has happened. Come at once to the Siam Intercontinental. Don't worry, I'll be on the next plane. See you then. Oh, you'll be on a plane to Bangkok tonight. And I'll be all alone in New York. I doubt that. It's happening as I planned it. Captain Rowland will meet him at the airport. Then work out the rest of it, Siraki. - I'll be glad to, sir. But be careful of that Walker. He has a reputation as a clever man. You called me, sir? - No... NO! What can I do for you? No. That is... What brings you here. I'm sure I heard my name. But you said Clementine... In my language it's "Small flower in the wind", that's me. You see, I was sent here. - Oh I see. I can offer you many spices, Or I might massage you gently. Well, I've already showered, but about that massage... You would like that then. Let me go get some things that I need and I'll be glad to. Good. What the... Doors sure aren't what they used to be. Hello? Send someone up to 45. Taxi. Taxi. What are you doing here? This isn't the employees entrance! Why, you little pipsqueak. I'm going to the airport. You're not going anywhere. - Stop clowning around! So you think I'm clowning, eh? You think I'm a pipsqueak, eh? Hey, come back here! Come back! Hey! Stop! Stop the car! Wait till I get my hands on you! I'll kill you with my bare hands! Step on it, I'm meeting someone in 20 minutes! Sure, sure. She's a good kid. So was our stewardess, I like it here. If you don't know what to do, just give me a call. Oh I don't know, I think I'll... I've heard about this island, The girls are wonderful! I got her phone number too. Darn, that's the stewardess, Kathin. Come on, get going will you. Won't this thing go any faster? Sure Mister, but the faster it go, more it cost. We go double fast, double price, understand? Sure, double price, double the time it takes to get where you're going. Let me out of this thing. Here, keep the change. No, come back. I take you! Taxi. Hey, taxi! I wanna use your taxi to get to the airport. I take you. - No, I'll buy the thing. OK. - OK? Here, you go and buy yourself a new one. - Thank you. Thank you! Shall I take you to good hotel, Mister? - No thanks, I'm waiting for a friend. Yes, sir. Jo Walker's here. Yeah, he's waiting for Rowland. We'll stay with him. Now what? Of course I'd buy a taxi with an empty gas tank. That's it. What is this then. Hey you! Is this perhaps the airport? - I'm okay. Couldn't you put on a clean shirt? I didn't know you worked at the hotel. You finally found a job that suits you. Cut it out. We're miles from town... Wait a minute. Mr. Walker. What happened to you? You're a mess! Oh that. I was thinking of taking a swim. If I were you I'd take a bath. Kathin, this is an old friend of mine. Kathin and I met on the plane. She's offered to give me a bath. Seems she gives a great massage, too. Anyway, I do need a bath. What's the name of the hotel? - The Siam lntercontinental. What about Mrs. Leighton's daughter? - I'm sure we can talk about her later. Let's go dear. Nice seeing you. Three serpents. He's playing right into our hands. This time he won't get away from us. Everything's been arranged. I'd give my right arm to stay here with you. Who ever heard of a one-armed stewardess? Don't be so mean. Why must you remind me of my job? Did you know the moon is full tonight? You know what that means? Dracula strikes. Where are you going? All we need now is a drink. Jo, there's an old proverb in our country: If you make love under the full moon you can only be parted by death. Really? But love comes and goes, like the full moon. Like stewardesses. Better take advantage of it. Oh, Jo... Hello? I get the impression you're beginning to fall for the guy. You must be mistaken. - I hope so. Don't take too long. OK. I won't. - You better not. So long. Bad news? Anything wrong? - No, I just forgot something. It's very easy to refresh your memory. Before you go to bed you tie a piece of string around your little finger. The next day it reminds you to pay the electricity bill. What about that drink? - OK. And now? I like strawberry lipstick. He stole my wallet! Let me go! He's the thief! Let me go! - Stop! Take your hands off me! Nice of you to come along. Police! Help! Police! I'll get you! Bite! Bite! The poison is sealed in the head. It's made of the black orchid Is it more deadly than the spider's poison? - Of course, that's tested. I want to be sure of the effect. Mr. Landru. The woman you're waiting for is up here. This can only mean that you have failed to carry out your mission. I wasn't able to. You should have killed him and you failed. Why? There wasn't enough time. - You're putting my organization in danger. I'll teach you what happens when you don't do as you're told. You're good for nothing. - Please! Silence! You don't deserve any mercy. I will send you to the island. Take her away! No please! Not to the island! Please! I'll do anything you want! Don't send me there! Not the island! No! Don't take me there! I'd rather die! Let's go. Get going. Shut up or I'll kill you right now! You deserve the same fate, Siraki, for letting Captain Rowland escape... ...but I need your skill. I'd be lost without your knowledge of oriental poisons. He's dead. You may go. I've been so upset. I'm so glad to see you. If you know how awful it's been. You're the only ones I can depend upon. You haven't heard anything? - Mrs. Leighton received an anonymous phone call... If Jo Walker doesn't leave Bangkok, she and her daughter will be in danger. So I invited her to stay here with me. There was no mention of money? A ransom? - No, it wasn't mentioned at all. I hope you didn't let them frighten you, Mrs. Leighton. I don't think you understand. Mrs. Leighton is a brave and determined woman. She wants you to finish the job. Why would those men have picked Phyllis? I don't understand. Let's hope I'm able to find out. Do you have a photo of your daughter? Yes of course. I always carry one. A very beautiful girl. I'll do the best I can to bring her back. We may have turned up a lead or two already. We were shot at on the way to the hotel. There were three serpents tattooed on the man's wrist. It might be the sign of some secret organization. I bet Mr. landru could tell us. He's an expert in oriental culture. Landru's an interesting man. We met at the police conference. Ancient oriental cultures are his specialty. What group would use three serpents to identify its members? Maybe a religious sect? If it's connected to a religion then the faithful are fanatics. Whoever they are, we're a threat to them. They way the shot at us, they mean business. And kidnapping rich young girls is their business. Maybe we're on to a syndicate. Here's where we get off. We'll walk the rest of the way. Keep the change. Thank you. It smells the same as ever. - What does? Bangkok. 2 years since I was last here but the smell is the same. Look out, Jo! Look out. Who do you work for? Who's paying you? Look at that, the same tattoo. If anyone knows, Landru does. A very remarkable man. I'm sure he can help us with the tattoos. I hope he can. Captain Rowland. I'm delighted to welcome you to my home. Thank you. An old friend of mine: Jo Walker. How do you do? - It's a pleasure, Mr.Walker. Jo needs your help. - Of course, come in. I'm a private detective hired by Mrs. Leighton. You've heard that her daughter is missing. Captain Rowland says that you're an expert on oriental tradition. and culture... ...specifically on the many different poisons that are used in the Orient. As a westerner, I need the advise of someone like you. You've often worked together with the police. You do great honor to a humble student of the East. I know about the effects of poisons but nothing of their composition. I want to know if there is in this country some secret organization... ...a religious sect... ...that use poison to commit their crimes? I've heard of many like that, but not one in particular. Do you know the meaning of a tattoo of three serpents with their tails entwined? That has no meaning. The use of serpents is quite common in the East. One sees the reptile as sinister, and gives it some dreadful connotation. It's a frequently used symbol, nothing more. There's been several attempts to kill me since I arrived here. The killers all had three snakes tattooed on their forearm. Aren't you reading too much into it? People who tattoo serpents are not always killers for hire. You have the same in the US. Your marines tattoo the word "Mother" on their chest... ...yet they're not all gangsters or crooks. Our orientals are just as decent as your sailors. If we learn more we'd like to come by again. Consider my home yours. May I offer you tea before you go? No thank you. We have work to do. Panna! We'll contact you soon. - I look forward to it. Thanks for your help, Mr. Landru. Shall I have someone take you back by boat? It's much faster to go by the canals. Yes, thank you. If you let them escape you again you will pay for it! Get going. Thanks to you our plans are working out. I never saw a more remarkable woman... ...and a lovelier face. - Thank you. He's a weird man that Landru. You've got to know all there is after 15 years here. Anyone who knows as much about Asia as he does is just the man to help us. But he didn't know what those three serpents mean. Step on it! What the hell is that? Take a look. Look out! Any questions? Should keep them off our back for ahwile. Where can I pick up one of those toys? Straight ahead. What's wrong with you? Captain, he seems to have been poisoned. Call an ambulance immediately. No one can help him now. Let's have a look. Serpents on his arm. Does that mean anything? It means he's connected to Madam Kim Soo. It's a well-known tattoo. Why would a man who works for Kim Soo commit suicide? Check the body, tell me what you learn. - Yes I will. Thailand is heaven on earth. You will enjoy it here. I like it already. - And the girls. You'll find that they're the most beautiful in the world. It's all over now. Trust me and I'll get you out. Who are you? I'm Petra, I'm the guardian here. They drugged you on opium. I gave you the antidote. The drops of water on your face made you think you were drowning. It was the drugs. They're gonna sell you as a prostitute. - You know a way out of here? I'm going to escape as soon as I can. - Take me with you! Not yet, it's too soon. The time will come and we'll both get out of here. I can't stay much longer, they'll drug me too. I heard Mr. Walker is looking for you... ...but I don't know where he is. The Siam lntercontinental. - But can he be trusted? Thank you, Petra. Good luck. Diamonds, eh? No need diamonds from now on. You sleep with white men, make many dollars. Hey! Look, it's Petra. Why is she swimming over here? Pull up the anchor and get closer. I'll bring her aboard. Here. Hold on. That's it. What are you doing here? Well?. I was swimming in the lagoon. You know you're supposed to stay on the iusland. Maybe she comes to amuse herself. Right, Petra? Why have you come here? It's boring with all those women all day long. You see? So you're bored, eh? Good evening. Did you wish to have dinner? Shall I bring the menu. Cigarette? - No, thanks. We'd like to talk to Madam Kim Soo. We heard she owns this place. Yes. Please tell her that we're here. - Of course. Many thanks. She's got quite a place here. I'd hate to be poor in a place like this. You asked for Madam Kim Soo? I was told you'd like to speak to her. That's right. - Who are you, if I may ask? Jo Walker. - Captain Rowland. I'm her secretary. May I be of help to you? You could get us an appointment to see her. Madam is certain to be as helpful as she can. Madam could start being helpful by talking to us. You might meet her tomorrow. If she's not out hunting she'll be at her house. Or will she? I think she said something about visiting her crocodile farm. I'll find out and let you know. - Much obliged. How long have you worked for Madam Kim Soo? Quite a few years. He was at the fights with his boss a few days ago. Thank you. Would you like to dance? I would. Why don't we? I meant somewhere else. I know a place a lot cosier than here. But what about my pal? Don't worry. He's so handsome someone's already with him now. She'll be as happy with him as I am with you. She's asking him the same as I am asking you. You will come? Please say you will. I promise you won't regret it. Hello, Landru? The boss wants no more mistakes. Fail again, and you're finished. I knew an airline stewardess who had the same car. It belongs to Kathin. When did you last see her? A few hours ago. When she tried to poison me. She doesn't keep the best company I'm afraid. You mean those guys I've been seeing all over? The ones with the three serpents? Those are the ones I mean. Thank you. That's a weird sounding bird. The man next door raises them as a hobby. Tell me about those serpents. Do you know who those men are? - I can tell you all about them. But I'd rather tell you later. I'm not in the mood for explanations. I didn't have any choice Jo. They forced me to do it. If I didn't they would kill me. Well done, Siraki. You may leave. From life to death. How fine an experience it is. In the Orient, death is as sacred as life itself. We celebrate both with sacred ceremony. Don't fear death. It sets you free forever. In a few moments, you will no longer exist, Mr. Walker. Farewell, Kommissar X. Wait here. I was waiting for you. They say wherever Jo Walker goes, Captain Rowland follows. And just in time to watch your friend die. Let's go, Captain. Oh no, I wanted to save you! I'd sworn he'd never die by an unclean hand. Where is Jo? In the other room. Come on. Dead? Paralyzed. We drugged him. I've got the antidote. Ge get it. Mrs. Leighton. Are you absolutely certain that she wore this? Talk to me! Who are you? Where is Petra? Where is she? Please, no. For last time: you tell or you die! - No, please don't. Talk or you die. Where is Petra? I don't know. She's gone to get... All I have to do is look the other way, and you're up to your old tricks. How'd you find me anyway? And what did you do with the brunette? I left her standing in front of the club. She's probably still there. Mr. Walker! Thank heavens. You don't know what I've been through. Poor Mrs. Leighton. Tell me all about it. - Maybe we'd better sit down. This morning they smashed the window. I heard an awful crash... ...and on the floor was this: my daughter's ring. And if that wasn't enough, some stranger threatened me on the phone. He said if they get you they will return my Phyllis. Of course. She wouldn't be caught dead without that ring. I hope you're right. They're trying to scare you. They tried toi intimidate us too. You'll have to trust me. I'm sure I can help you. At least we now know your daughter is alive. If only I could be sure. I feel so helpless. There's always the police. No Mr. Walker. This is much safer. We won't give up until we've found your daughter. Excuse me, Mr. Walker. You have to disturb me when I'm talking business? I heard the shower in your bathroom. I thought it was you at first. Maybe another Scotsman saving his own water. Excuse us, we'd better have a look. I'll be at the pool later. Open the door. Scotsman, eh? I didn't take anything. Are you sure? I'd swear you took a bath. The minute I came in I noticed it was missing. Kommissar X? Yeah, Kommissar X. Phyllis Lfighton sent me. - What? I was on the island with her. Your drinks. Thank you. I'm sure Captain Sarit will be glad to have that information. I don't know exactly where the island is. Someone on the plave said that there is a boat three times a week. There is, but only customers know. That must be an expensive ride. - The police should be able to find the island. You're positive you saw Phyllis? Mr. Walker, we're in luck. You've got to go there. If what Petra told us is true it might work. What? What if I paid a visit to the island? - You? Why not? Professionally. MY profession. Of course it is the ultimate sacrifice, but I've got a reputation to uphold. Jo, wait. Jo. He told me you take a boat there. - What can I bring you. Captain? - Whisky. A beer. We were both high on the plane when we met so I didn't think much about it. He goes by the name Mezanto, or so he said. But the mark of three serpents is something else. I know all about the three serpents. An organization devoted to public service. Benevolent works. Madam Kim Soo operates it. Madam Kim Soo is very rich and gives most of it to her charity. How come Landru didn't know what it meant if it's so well known? Mr. Landru may nbot have heard of it. It may not have been important to him. Maybe he wasn't interested in the folklore. If you ask me, Madam Kim Soo has some weird employees. Someone is using the organization as a private charity. Whoever does that is lower than a serpent. I wouldn't be surprised if one of her people is mixed up in this. But Madam Kim Soo herself is above reproach. I knew you would come. I knew you'd be interested in the island. You're going to enjoy yourselves. Do they also have European women there? They have every kind you can imagine. Where is this island of yours? Is it here in Bangkok? I don't know, it's kept a secret. The operation itself is no secret though. I've always gone there with one of the men from the organization. It's expensive. You pay for what you get. - Indeed. If we decide to go, who do we talk to to get there? You meet here in Bangkok, and are told where to make contact. Then, you're drugged. No one is drugging me! It's perfectly safe, the drug is harmless. Just a precaution. You fall asleep, and while you sleep they take you there. And then? Then you experience the greates moment of your life. I've had some pretty wild experiences, so it'd better be good. Those guys are okay. Don't spoil my fun. I'm halfway there already. And where are you supposed to meet? Someone's house, but always a different place. It's never the same. Sometimes they meet you in the harbor, sometimes it's in town. Once they even called off the whole trip. Who is behind this? Mezanto, who is it? Madam Kim Soo. Madam Kim Soo, I'm Captain Rowland. - Hello, Captain. I'm Jo Walker. - How do you do? It's very kind of you to invite us. - We'd like to ask you a few questions. You own the Island of a Thousand Lotus Blossoms? Yes. Have you seen my crocodiles? Beautiful creatures, aren't they? I heard you have far more beautiful creatures on that island. Kreaturenauflhrerlnsel. True. As you know, it is an island of pleasure. Tell me... ...are there any Europeans working there? Not now. But there was one there She was partly Spanish. But I had to send her away. She was a thief. She could be the one who said many of the girls on the island were tortured and drugged. One was an American: Phyllis Leighton. You are mistaken. There are only Thai girls there. I suppose if she stole from you she could have been lying to us. It seems that is what happened. Our girls are paid very well. No one is tortured. And I don't believe in drugs. I demand the girl comes here and admits she's wrong. The poor girl's dead. She was murdered. Sorry to hear it. Still, she was a liar. I suppose she was angry for getting fired. And this is her revenge on me. What is it? You don't believe me? We do. But we would like to see the island. We both have a weakness for beautiful girls. Go to number 206, New Road. - That's Bangkok's Chinese section. And then? You tell them your wishes. But there's no need to go to all that trouble. Why don't you go there with me? It would be a pleasant journey. And Mr. Walker could take a personal tour. To better appreciate the beauty if the island. dieSchönheitenderlnsel vorstellen. It would be a pleasure. - I have prepared tea. I wouldn't mind some. - Me neither. You sure have a nice place here, Madam. - Yes, sir. A bit on the strong side. That's the best kind though. Frank! - I guess it was too strong for him. Frank's been poisoned. How do you account for that? Who could tell why he killed himself? Suicide or not, please call the police. You're out of your mind. She would have taken us. Instead, Mr. Walker starts backing out. "Yes Madam.", "No, Madam." "I'd be delighted, Madam." Why didn't you simply accept the offer? With her we would have found nothing there. She's the type who keeps her nose clean. She's no fool. So here is Trevor Cummings of Austin, Texas. Clean cut American tourist who is looking for an evening of adventure. The kind you see all over with a camera. He'll be drugged and wake up on the island. I like the idea. Clever, don't you think? And if anything goes wrong, I'll have you to get me out. OK. And what if they use cyanide? No one is gonna inject me with anything. These are for you. I don't wear sunglasses. Get used to it. There's a receiver inside. And where is the transmitter? Haven't you noticed how fasninating mother nature is? Jo, what are you talking about? I love flowers. The lotus blossom is one of mother nature's loveliest creations. Her delicate scent carries for miles. I am very pleased to meet you, Mister. American have much money. I am very pleased with American dollars. I have a couple of those. - Oh no, that is too much. Just take me to the island where the women are. And buy yourself something nice. - We go, my boat take you. You happy you come. One, two, three, four... so many dollars. You old goat. Hey, Na Ki Poo, how about some tea? I bring, I bring. Special drink. Very strong. Potion make man love much. This one night you never forget. Here, you drink. It make you strong. Make you very manly. You will see. What does that mean, those three golden serpents? Very old sign. Rest now. You very tired. You have good dreams. You dream many beautiful girls all in love with you. And when you wake up, good dream come true. You see. What you see? I see... - Tell me. I see... Nice lady? What you dream? You tell me. Three... That's it. I see three... - Ladies? No. I see... ...three... ...golden... ...serpents. Sleep! Sleep, yes. Come here. Take him. Put him in the boat. Take him away! Hurry you fools, the boat is waiting. Hurry, take him away! What a pleasant surprise, seeing you here, Mr. Walker. Pleasure's all mine, Madam. I've been looking forward to this meeting. So we could be alone together. I mean - to be alone with a person who understands. When you have problems to share then you need a friend whom you can trust. I usually curl up with a good book until they go away. I know I must seem weak to you. On the contrary, I think you're very strong, Madam Kim Soo. There. That's enough, Mr. Walker. Stop! I said that's enough. I wanr you, I'm not the kind of woman you can fool around with. I'm sure you're not, my little lotus blossom. You will see how well I can hate in a minute. You're detestable. All white men are. I can't stand it when you paw me like that. Why are you so bitter? The only man I ever loved was an American. I expected to be paid for his cruelty. Paid? You're getting paid alright. All who are not my race will pay. I'm sorry, but that had to be done. Listen. We must go out of our way to make your visit one you will never forget. What's the matter? She's more than polite. She's talking about murder. Captain Rowiand, your imagination is getting away with you. Madam Kim Soo is too well known. She wouldn't risk her reputation like this. She's the boss of a huge criminal organization. Where can that island be? I'll find it myself if I have to. It won't be that easy. Can't you tell the location of the transmitter? - Sure, if the signal continues. Excuse me, we have to locate this signal. Yes, sir. Anna Bergson, the wife of a Swedish engineer. Drugged? A hopeless addict. This is Jeanette Dupree, an archaeology student. Her French beauty is much in demand. Gina Mariani. An Italian. She's 15. That one is gonna cost you plenty. - She was expensive. And here we have a former stewardess, Kathin Russel. I think you've met. You can take up where you left off. Where can I find Phyllis Leighton? She's still being prepared by Chang. Tie him up. Where is it? South West of the Ko Si island. Near the place where the Gold Cobra was. We've got to know the exact place. Yes, but we can't rush things. He's doing the best he can. Try again. Now you'll see what the vengeance of Madam Kim Soo is like. When this takes effect... ...you will regret the day you were born. No signals are coming in. It stopped sending. The darn thing's gone dead. Completely. You're right. It's dead as can be. Then so is Jo. No! No! This is inhuman! They're coming. Take them away! I can't stand it! No more! I can't stand it! Please! Please take them away! Please! I can't stand it! No! I can't... Jo! Jo. Can you hear me? - Kathin. Oh, Jo. Why are you here, Kathin? I tried to save you. Now they're going to kill me for it. I love you, Jo. Kathin, we still have a chance. We'll never escape. No one's ever escaped from this island. They'll kill us. - Do you see that flower? That lotus blossom by your right foot. Kick it over here. But hurry. Tom, can you hear me? I need your help. You've got to get here before Madam Kim Soo kills us. Find this island so you can stop her. But don't come alone. Get the police to help. But hurry or it will be too late. Please, Tom! Contact the marines. Call the coast guard. Or the army. Do something! I've got it. Latitude 24 degrees, longitude 18 degrees. Its about 210 miles from here. 210 miles? We'll never get there in time to save Jo. It's too late. Take it easy. I'll make you a Scotch and soda. It'll be good for you. Who said Scots are underpaid? This is the end, Kathin. There is no point in keeping death waiting. Kill her. Now, Mr. Walker. This is Miss Leighton. The police have occupied the island. We're in trouble. Unchain the girls. We will need them for hostages. Be quick about it. Someone called the police. - But who? That brings down the curtain on the final act. Hurry you fools. They will be here any minute. Hurry! The tide has gone. get the planks. It's the only way. Get them all here. Welcome, Madam. Get over there.. - I see her. Phyllis! Mother! - Sweetheart! It's all over, mother. Who is this, climbing out of the ooze? After this, your name is mud. Don't mention it. You wouldn't have a cigarette would you? - Better. Have a sigar, Kommissar X. Got a light? - Sure. What do you know - Kommissar X plays in the mud. What are your plans for tonight, Mr. Walker. If there's no one in my shower I'll clean up first. And then I'm going out into town. The girls in bangkok are really something. I heard there's an island where you can find... I've had enough of islands. Besides, I wouldn't know how to get there.
