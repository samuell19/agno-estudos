Subtitle synced by Anomix33 I am surprised, Your honour! Why the court is sparing the life of the one... ...who is a smuggler and ruins the life of children, by making them criminals. I don't understand why the court is not punishing him... ...even though he is guilty of... ...12 cases of smuggling, 6 hold-ups, 3 rapes and 2 murders. I knew this smuggler from ages. He has murdered lnspector Shinde. And I have proof of it. Isn't the testimony of retired I.G. Srikant Mathur, enough to... ...give him a death sentence? The court requests Mr.Srikant to produce all proofs against Pasha... ...before 18th of September, to enable the court to give its verdict. Open the door. Pasha ...here! Kalu, this letter should reach Pasha, understood? - Which one? - The upper one. Go! Pasha, we feel that if there is anyone who can trap I.G. Srikant... ...then it's your own man, Jackie. Is this Mr. Jackie's garage? Can't you see it's his garage. What work do you have? - We wanted to meet him. - He doesn't stay here after eight. Can you tell me, where we can meet him now? - It's not right to meet him now. - We had some urgent work. Let them go; what have we got to do? There is a bar nearby, you will find Jackie there. Did you recognise me? - Shall I come in? - Come in, how are you? - Hey, can't you speak clearly? - Sure. I mean... she is Swapna. You know, I am a poor teacher. I love her very much, from the past 2 years. Then marry her. - He doesn't allow me to. - Who? Her brother, Raman. He's a rich man. Raman is my step-brother. He wants to get me married... ...to some rich smuggler. - But we are... - Poor. So what if you're poor? Her brother has threatened to get me beaten up. What! Swapna do you really intend to marry him? If not marriage with him, I will commit suicide. Don't cry. Call the priest tomorrow at 11 a.m. I will get them married. Your sister's getting married tomorrow at 11 a.m., at Jackie's place. Until our friend Billa is alive, this marriage won't take place. No one will dare to face Billa. The one who dares to stop us today, will be responsible for his death. Don't worry, Uncle. Our Jackie is enough for all of them. Don't interfere, Jackie. It's the question of a poor man's love. So enemity with us, eh! I am ready to take up enemity with the whole world. In your own colony? With your stooges and with weapons? Jackie has promised to perform the marriage. So only Jackie will have to die. Right. Santu, drop your weapons. If you can break this sacred thread, and get inside, you win... ...or we will win. Priest, you perform the marriage. When the ceremonies are over... ...he will break the string. Let's get away. The marriage is over. - What is it? - There's a letter for you from Pasha. Jackie, I reared you and gave you a new life. But today, my life is in danger. I can be sentenced to death, due to I.G.Srikant's testimony... ...in the court, on 25th September. You have to stop him from giving the testimony. And you know how it is to be done. At present Srikant is with his family, celebrating "Janmasthami" at Khandala. Your guardian... Pasha. Whom are you scaring by firing in the air, Mr I.G.? I no longer do that, madam. Now I am only a retired I.G.P. Uma has sent this photograph for you to see, Sir. Very good! Dear father... ...you loving daughter, Radha. Our daughter is not coming, as she is staying back for her... ...college youth festival. At least your loving sister is here. Okay, Jamuna is my sister, but make her understand that a widow... ...should not have such thoughts. Even I don't like all that. But since she is a widow... ...I can't say anything. Shanti, where is Jamuna? She is sitting there and reading some Holy text. - Mummy, aunty is calling you. - Go on, I will come. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. I was looking at the pictures of our old traditions. Even I want to see them, Mom. These traditions are only for adults. You go and play with Uma aunty. Go and see, she might be sitting there glued to her hero's photograph. Aunty, tell me what a hero means. Like Lord Rama of "Ramayana" and Lord Krishna of "Mahabharata". - And your hero? - My hero? This... - And Radha Aunty's? - Radha Aunty's hero? Radha aunty's hero is in her dreams. He might be in a far away valley or mountains... ...and might be coming on a chariot with 5 horses. There's nothing to worry about. Pasha has sent me. My name is Jackie. State your business. You have to testify against Pasha on 25th December, don't you? Yes. Will Pasha will be hanged due to that? Yes, he will be. No, he won't be, because you will withdraw your testimony. I have been listening to such threats from the last 35 years. If I wish, I can finish all of you. The fate of your family is in your hands. My duty was to warn you. I have done that. You are lucky, my gun cannot be used today. Your loving daughter, Radha. Stop, Srikant! There is no one to cry after me. But you have many loved ones. Think it over. There are 19 more days for the testimony. Let's go. Oh God, what is all this? Uncle, we should go to Bombay immediately. Never. These threats couldn't ever deter my path, and never will. It's good Damodar didn't come, or there would have been bloodshed. Never mind all that. Damodar is a coward in a police uniform. - Greetings, uncle! - Greetings! - How's Mr. Srikant? - He's fine. He has gone to Khandala. - Gone to enjoy the cool breeze? - Yes. Keep in touch at least. Uncle, some Indian policemen don't even get time to breathe. - Smugglers? - Yes. - Shall I go? I am in a hurry. - Okay, carry on with your duty. He is very close to me. I.G. Srikant had brought him from an orphanage. He reared him like his son, and today he is an lnspector. He is very strict. All of you stand up and form a single line. You stand at the back. What's your name? Your real name? Ganga and Lakshmi! You are maligning those names by being Tina and Lila? You all are a blot on womanhood. You are sheltering rogues in this place! I will put you all behind bars. No, sir, please let me go. My brother's running a high fever. I had to do all this, for his treatment. I am a helpless girl. There is nothing to eat at home. - My mother expired two days back. - How? She had asthma; she died due to lack of treatment. You go home. Not you! - I am Uma speaking. - How did you call up here? I came to know from the police station, that you are there. - What's going on? - Nothing. It's work as usual. Wear it properly. - What? - I was not speaking to you. - Speak up. - Where is Radha? She has gone for the youth festival, and is coming tomorrow. She is okay. Why do you worry? Wear it properly. - I will tell you when you return. - Okay. Tell me one thing. - Do you think about me? - Yes, I do. - Do you do the same? - Yes, that is why... - Wear it properly! - What's happened to you? I was not telling you that. Okay, I will hang up now. - The I.G. seems to be very strict. - We must think of another idea. - I have a plan. - What plan? You all will go in the guise of bandits, and I, a policeman. Then? Then we can trap Srikant's daughter, Radha. Looks like someone is coming. Did the bandits leave? Take me away, please. - Leave me. - What are you doing? I won't spare that swine! Damodar, see what is written. Your daughter will be with me, until Pasha is released from the jail. Remember, a wrong move can ruin your daughter's honour and her life. Your enemy... Jackie. Leave it, father. It can lead to even her death. Before that, I will kill all of them. She is my daughter. She belongs to all of us. Leave it! Aunty, ask him not to take law in his hands. Trust me. I am also a member of this family. I'll bring Radha. Take care of him, I'll call the police. Oh God! What's all this! Pasha, you have challenged my honour. I will not spare you and your son. Now you will understand my language. Very good, Jackie. You are lying! You are not policemen. - Listen to me. - I don't want to listen to you. Go away, or I'll break your head. Had it been someone else, we would have managed. But she is uncontrollable. We are trying to make her understand that we are policemen... ...and that we have kept her in safe custody. But she does not believe us. How will we manage her for so many days? This doesn't behove gentle maidens like you. You are ruffians! I have been kidnapped. I know how to straighten all of you! Don't do such things with me, understood? I beg of you, take all my ornaments, but leave me. Look, we are not what you think. We are government servants. We can only obey the orders. Then why don't you let me talk to my father? What is all this? This is the result of your father's enemity with a bandit. He is looking for you everywhere... So, our I.G. has asked us to keep you in safe custody... ...far away from the city. But how can I believe you? Do you have any proof? Wait for 24 hours. You will get the proof also. It is a tape! Tape! Who threw it here? Greetings, Sir! All of us have our own problems. Your daughter wants proof and we want your testimony. And you want your daughter's life. On the other side of the tape, you have to only repeat... ...what I say. Listen carefully. Dear Radha, lack of time and the danger of bandits have... ...compelled us to send you with Jaikishan and his colleagues. Inspector Jaikishan is a very honest officer. You can stay there... ...until you receive my next message. Rest later. Your father...Srikant. After recording this, you keep the tape behind the big door. If you play any tricks, Radha's corpse will be sent to you. This is not possible. Why're you breaking them, you can do that... when our daughter's body arrives. I will die, but will never bow to their request. You will not have to do that. It's not the time to get emotional... ...but to use our brains. It's a matter of Radha's life. - Come along, Uma. - Why Uma? Radha, I am Damodar speaking. Lack of time and the danger of bandits have... ...compelled us to send you with Jaikishan and his colleagues. Inspector Jaikishan is a very honest officer, you can stay there... ...until you receive my next message. Rest later. Okay, but what will we do all these days? He says, whatever God wishes, will happen. No. Everything will happen according to my wish. What do you mean? - Who am I? - A girl. - Am I a girl? - Yes, a beautiful girl. - No, I am not a girl. - Then what are you? I am the I.G's daughter. Which means... ...I am your I.G. at present. So, you should not smoke or booze in my presence. You will never look into my eyes. We will become blind. Your hero doesn't seem to have liked my idea. - We didn't like it, too. - What? Nothing. And listen; I am used to having milk twice a day. Lady Diana; this is a forest, and not your dad's palace. We will bring rice and lentils, cook them and then feed you. No, I will cook for you. Now go and have your bath, and come like gentlemen. You all look like ruffians. We are ruffians. So, shouldn't we look like this? He is saying that we have disguised as ruffians... ...so we should look like them. Okay. I didn't even ask your names. Which makes Sa, Re, Ga, Ma. Harsh policemen and names so melodious! What are you doing inside? Come out. Let's go. It's the hero calling. She looks gorgeous! Don't forget your objective, over the girl. The girl won't stay here for 18 days. She will run away, one day. The day she tries to escape, shoot her. Where have they gone? "Spring rising from her slumber..." "this is my first season." "The nightingale sings a rhapsody." "Spring rising from her slumber..." "this is my first season." "I'm at youth's threshold." "I feel nothing except..." "nights of desire..." "oh such forlorn days." "I can't trust myself..." "in my first season..." "when I hear the nightingale singing her rhapsody." "It's a strange feeling." "I blush when I imagine..." "what the wind whispers into my ears." "I see budding blossoms in a new light..." "in my first season..." "when I hear the nightingale singing a new rhapsody." It's alright. You sing nicely. - Did you hear me sing? - Yes. We even saw you. - Saw me? - We saw everything. - What?! - He means, you sing melodiously. He says, it was wonderful. Wonderful! The ones chasing criminals were... ...listening to music today. You're not aware of our talents. It's not good to roam about all alone. I know. You are not aware of music and songs. I am also a policeman's daughter. It's just one work for you all day! Arrests! Attacks! It must be my father, in search of me. - They are the bandits. - Bandits! In a helicopter? They're a rich gang. They go about in helicopters. Yes. Even daddy was saying something like this. Don't cry. Srikant has gone in search of her. - He will catch the scoundrel. - Get me my Radha. She will surely come. But in what condition? I am very much worried. A young boy and a girl, by themselves.. and that too, in a jungle! Wonder what he is doing to her! Radha is very young and innocent too. Aunty, what are you doing? Is this the way to console someone? What is left to be consoled for! We are ruined for sure! Why didn't God make them take me away? If they wanted, they could have taken me instead... ...why did they take Radha along? A young girl! And a young boy... Hey, come here. My hand can't get there. Come here. Come on, scrub my back. Scrub my back, I say. Don't do it like girls. Use some force. That's very good. The girl is nice. Feel like spring has arrived. I spent my whole life with thieves and crooks. She sings and dances nicely. Apply it on the front too. - You? - Yes, son. You're utterly shameless. You are getting scared, as if I am going to kidnap you. You are very ill-mannered. A few minutes back, you were praising me! Don't worry Mr. Srikant. We have informed the police force... ...all over Maharashtra and Goa. And they are searching day and night. Please get me the I.G.'s of Gujarat and Karnataka. Okay, sir; I'll talk to them. What happened? What happened? I am missing my parents a lot. I saw a bad dream. Dreams are after all dreams. My father is not concerned about my whereabouts. But we are keeping him informed. Why do you worry? You policemen are all alike. All of you are stone-hearted. You don't know how it feels, being separated from your parents. You don't feel anything. You may not be having parents, so you don't feel that affection. How will you know what love is, when you have never loved. I feel suffocated here. You have caged me. Neither can I roam around, nor sing freely. You are all stone-hearted. Don't worry, we are with you. It's matter of a couple of days. As soon as the danger subsides... ...we will reach your home. You don't feel anything. You may not be having parents... ...so you don't feel that affection. How will you know what love is, when you have never loved. What happened, mother? Take care of Kishan, after my death. Don't talk like that. I'll get all your medicines today. I will sell all the goods at half the prices today. Take care of yourself. The doctor has advised you not to... ...play the flute. A doctor can only treat our ailments; not our pains or poverty. You are my life, Shanta. I cannot live without you. Don't say so. Our son has to grow up and became an educated and respectable man. Okay, I will not play the flute. But I can at least sell them. Come on, son. We will sell a lot of flutes today. Come here. Playing the flute, won't help you. Sir, My wife is very ill. I am in need of money. You need money? Take this money. You take all the flutes and give me the money. Flutes! Will I break my head with those? Play some nice tune. A very pleasant tune. I will play all the tunes you say. No father, mother has forbidden you from playing the flute. Keep quiet. Can't you see, he is offering so much of money. Sit down. Go on... Play! Father! Is that all?! Is this how you recite? Sir, I'll continue. Let me take a breather. No father, you won't recite anymore. I will give a recital. Sir, I will play it for you. You'll play! Play it! Ramu, your wife expired. Father! In this world, no one understands the language of the weak... Here, only the powerful can survive. Come, I'll teach you my way. - Jaikishan is your name, right? - Yes. But I will call you Kishan. Because you play the flute very well. Where did you learn it from? I used to listen to this tune from childhood. My father used to play it. I will miss you all a lot, when I go home. You must come home. My father is a very nice person. He used to always tease me, when I was a child. He used to say that he will get me married to a policeman. - But I don't like policemen. - Now what will you say? Now? Now I will say, I like a policeman very much... - ...if he stops smoking. - Smoking? Yes, you. - And what if I weren't a cop? - Even then. But before killing them, it's important to save Radha. The problem is, that even if the police attacks them... ...they will shoot Radha, that instant. Or will use her as a shield. If we go to them disguised as bandits, and attack them, then? Then they will take Radha along and escape. And our men will catch them. "For this lovely evening, in the name of love." "Whenever the flute of memories plays haunting melodies..." "the heart soars like a bird." "Shackles..." "they shackle in our feet, they watch the sights." "And yet they fly..." "and yet they fly in the carefree skies." "Like birds true to love." "For this lovely evening, for the sake of your love." "What if things went haywire, what if the Spring were destroyed?" "I'm afraid that we might part after a brief meeting." "Where shall we meet...?" "we are birds bound by love." "Not arrows, not swords..." "not high walls..." "lovers shall not be prevented, now that they have met." "Birds destined to win shall not be defeated." Radha, I've come. Came in from the rear. Scoundrel! Rogue! Bandit! - It's me. - No. - Kishan, those bandits have come. - Come on, get in. Make it fast. They are coming. Escape with Radha on our motorcycle. But they are chasing Radha. - I can't leave you all and go. - For friendship's sake, please go. - But Radha! - I have a way of saving Radha. How? - How do I look? - Shut up! Stand properly. I was calling out to you, Radha. Didn't you recognise my voice? Let's go. - What happened, Kishan? - Nothing. Jackie has escaped, sir. We have no idea about his whereabouts. What happened, Kishan? Blood! You are hurt and you didn't even tell me. Let me rest for sometime. Please help me. I feel the bullet has scraped his arm. I have stopped the bleeding but the pulse is very weak. Do one thing, keep giving him medicines at one hour intervals. - I'll come in the evening. - Doctor... You have taken shelter here. Trust in God now. I will reach you till the door. What is all this, Kishan. He will be alright, won't he? The physician has said that if he doesn't regain consciousness within 24 hours, then it will be dangerous. I am the manager of this rest house and temple since 15 years. I have seen many wishes being fulfilled here. If your love for him is true... ...then the Goddess will surely save him. I take an oath in front of the Goddess, as a true lover... That till Kishan regains consciousness... ...I won't wear these bangles again. - But how did all this happen? - He is a police officer. The bandits killed two of our men. And there is no news about the other four. Wonder where they are? You know very well, where Jackie is. - Where is Jackie? - Where is Jackie? Tell us his whereabouts, and we will release you. Where is Jackie? Speak! God has heard my prayers. You are alright, Kishan. Have some water at least, my child. I am grateful to you, O Mother. Sir, two of Jackie's accomplices were killed and four were arrested. Even then, you couldn't bring my daughter to me. Jackie is wounded, he can't go far. He might be somewhere near. Wherever he is... Until I get him, I can't return home. - It's you, sir? - Yes, it's me. Now I will get you Jackie's corpse. "My beloved, my sweetheart, my love, my heart-throb..." "my beloved, my Romeo." "My beloved..." "You are my beloved, you are my heart-throb." "In my love-story, you are my hero." "In the texts of love, however..." "my fate adds up to zero." "Between lovers, there is no one poor, there is no rich." "Few are those who are fortunate to find such love." "This world is far removed from hearts in love..." "only hearts in love are close to each other." "Few are those who see such good fortune." "What you say, you know best. All I know, my beloved..." "You are my sweetheart. You are my heart-throb." "In my love-story, you are my hero." "In the texts of love, however..." "my fate adds up to zero." "In a lover's palm, there's a line of love..." "it speaks for his destiny." "Not without reason does someone dream of you." "Only those who have the good fortune, fall in love..." "only those who own estates." "Whatever happens, Juliet still belongs only to Romeo." "They're old tales. All I know is that..." "in the text of love..." "my fate adds up to a big zero." "In the texts of my love..." "you are my hero." "It's enough that you love me..." "that you desire me." "My heart thinks of you a thousand times in a moment." "Let's see who can separate us, my love..." "who deprives us our love." "When does love ever wait for anyone?" "You know what you say. All I know, my beloved..." "I am your beloved. You are my sweetheart..." "In my love-book, you are my hero." No, mother, this can never happen. I am a thief and a criminal! I can do any crime, but not this. Her love is so sacred and pure... ...And I am so contaminated! She thinks, I am Kishan, whereas I am Jackie. She thinks, I am a policeman, but the law says, I am a criminal! I am her father's enemy. I have kidnapped her. Don't test me like this, O Mother! Punish me severely. - My name is not Kishan. - Yes, I heard everything. And I have also seen, what is in store for me. Kishan, don't you love me very much? - No, I don't love anybody. - It's a lie. Your restlessness, your voice and your very being says that you love me. I am a fugitive, Radha. I am a sinner. Will you listen to me? If you want, you can ask for my life. Because, I won't be able to survive without you. Surrender yourself to the law. Sacrifice makes love immortal. Love is a test. And the ones who are scared of the results are not true in their love. You may be a criminal in the eyes of the world. But for me, you are a very big man. And I want to show that to the world. Let everybody know, that you have a heart too, which is full of love, which feels pain and is truthful. I will do as you say. Don't cry. Now that I have got you, I don't even fear the death-noose, too. I will surrender myself to the law. I am proud of your love. And always be. Kishan, promise me, that whenever you return... ...we will meet here at the same spot, near the temple. Sure. If I do come back. Don't say that, Kishan. God always helps true lovers. Let's see, how much He helps us. Go now. Listen... My mother had given me this locket in my childhood. "You are my sweetheart..." "you are my heart-throb." "In my love-story, you are the hero." Speak, Damodar. Sir, Jackie has surrendered to the police. She is gloomy, from the time she has returned. Wonder what all had occurred in these 16 days. He's a young boy... She's a young girl... That's enough, Aunty! You have made her cry a lot since yesterday. Now don't make her cry anymore. Why should I! The world will make her cry... ...when people will start rejecting her proposals. I would say, marry her off... ...before everyone comes to know about this. I feel you are hiding something from me. Yes, my heart is burdened. I can't hide anything from you and brother. I will tell you everything. Even if the law grants bail to Jackie's accomplices... But I want Jackie to get a death sentence. Don't worry, uncle. I have prepared the case against Jackie in such a way... ...that even the Supreme Court won't be able to save him. - Has Jackie surrendered himself? - Yes. - Why? - Why? - Because Radha had told him to. - Radha had told him to. Because Radha has started loving him. - Which Radha? - Our Radha. Radha takes him to be her husband. He had promised her to mend his ways. That enemity has become a love story. If Jackie is hanged, then Radha... What will she do? Then I will consume poison, brother. I cannot live without Kishan. He is not a criminal. He has been forced to become a criminal. I have never hidden anything from you or sister-in-law. I swear upon you... ...he had no evil designs for me. If he wished, he could have done anything to me. For the sake of my love, he even risked his own life. Please save him, brother. I beg of you...! Or your sister will be a widow before marriage. No, Radha. We are with you. I will speak the truth... And nothing, but the truth. Didn't you find it necessary to wear your uniform today? It's because we become strict when we wear our uniforms, Your Honour. While testifying, we tend to forget human emotions. I will say only what is written in the Holy Gaiter. It's written, that if a sinner accepts his sins... ...and accepts punishment for it... ...he is not called a sinner. We used to wander day and night to arrest Jackie. Ultimately, what came of it? Nothing. Isn't the proof enough... ...that Jackie has surrendered by himself? He 'was' a criminal. Now he 'is' not. There is a lot of difference between 'was' and 'is'. We have to forget his past and have to think about... ...what he is and what he will be. If he wants to become a good man than I request you... ...that the law should be lenient... ...so that, he can become a good citizen, because... Your honour I spoke too much. I'm sorry, I became sentimental. But whatever I said was true, isn't it? The court sentences Jackie, alias Jaikishan under Section 362... ...to two years of rigorous imprisonment. He betrayed me! Sir, Pasha has escaped after killing two men. - What! - Pasha escaped! Yes, me. Don't worry; we have come to receive you. Now, you have to go to Mr.David in Singapore, with these four men. You fake passport is ready. I would say, it's not good to delay Radha's marriage. But we should get a nice boy. How is Mr. Prem's son? He is closely related. But the boy is nice. Jackie won't be released for at least 2 years. And it will be very tough for us to keep Radha unmarried till then. I forgot! One of your old friends has sent you a letter from Singapore. - From Singapore? - It from Mr. Jimmy Thapa. Jimmy's! He was with me in college. Last year, he was charged by the customs, I helped him. He has sent some of your photographs, with him. Take a look. I am looking so fat! Read what he has written. Indian Police and Customs are very strict. So, I don't like it there. My business is flourishing here. I can't come to India for the next 2 or 3 years. I will get married here. The moments that I spent with you... Hope, you will like it. - Uma? - What is it? I have got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage. What idea? Hey you, we have kids here. Do whatever you want, but quietly. Son, you sleep. It does not concern you. Go to sleep. Who is he? I don't know. But he wants to meet you. - Call him in. - Yes, sir. Greetings, all of you. Greetings. I am sorry. I didn't recognise you. - But I know all of you. - How come? Take this, sir. He is my nephew. - He is studying medicine in America. - I don't understand. - Can I sit down? - Yes. Please have a seat. Mr. Srikant, I stay in Kenya. We are of Indian origin. I came to Bombay yesterday. My nephew's parents have died. I'm the only one left. He is a very hardworking boy. But what is it that you want to say? - Is she your mother? - No, she is my sister. Then tell her not to interrupt. Jamuna, just a minute... The matter is that... Radha and Jimmy were together in college. They love each other and have decided to marry each other. The tumbler fell from my hand also, when I came to know about it. Jimmy had told me clearly, that if the marriage doesn't take place... ...then they will consume poison. Now I'm thinking, you should think, all of us should think... ...after all, it's a matter of our prestige. If the children elope and get married in the court... Then? And if they consume poison, then? Ask him to consume it and give some of it to you also. It's you? What is this nonsense, Damodar? This is not nonsense. This is reality. It is difficult for me to tell the truth, in front of you... ...and for you to listen to the truth. So, I had to put on this act. But it is true, that Radha and the boy... ...love each other. Damodar, have you seen the boy? Yes. Not only that, I know him very well too. Look aunty... if we don't listen to them... ...we will have to repent for it. Damodar won't lie. The boy is studying medicine in America. Radha likes him... if we are getting a nice son-in-law... ...why not wait for 2 or 3 years. By then, even Radha can complete her B.A. It's not so easy to marry her off, under the present circumstances. Come out. Come here. Till now, you were so close to me. And today, you are hiding everything from me. Father... Kishan, I can't come to meet you in the jail. And this might be my last letter to you. Brother has postponed my marriage by two years, under this condition. How will I survive? Your memories will torment me every moment, for these two years. We will meet, Kishan. At the same spot, where we had departed. "We were separated only the other day." "But how shall I live in this state?" "Death did not come to me. Your memories come back to me." "What a long separation." "In a love of a few days..." "it's a very long separation." "To my lips comes, my love... a cry of anguish." "This is indeed a long separation." "To begin with, my beloved is not with me..." "and there is no hope of meeting him either." "And there are these fires of passion raging..." "what a long separation." "Our rosegardens are all destroyed..." "before the roses could blossom." "The love-birds have been separated, even before they could meet." "The cry of the nightingale awakens me." "What a long separation." "It's a newfound love, my God..." "and we face such a long separation." The government is releasing Jackie, six months earlier... ...because of his good conduct. If the government allows me to commit a murder... ...then I will murder Jackie first. He can take revenge any time. Keep a strict vigil on him. Yes, I am already keeping an eye on him. But now, I should keep a strict vigil. Who, Jackie? He left, two hours back. "My love, my beloved, my heart-throb, my sweetheart..." "my beloved, my Romeo..." "My beloved." "I'm your sweetheart, you are my heart-throb..." "In the texts of love, however..." "you are my hero." Brother, you have already met Kishan, isn't it? No, I am seeing him now. Look here, Jackie. I mean, Radha's Kishan. You are not a hero, as yet. You have to become one. Because the stigma which you have on you... ...I mean, which you had. You know what that means? Yes. I cannot forget the past all my life. I heard, you are a good motor mechanic. Yes. One of my friend owns a big motorcycle factory. You do one thing. Radha, you go home. And you come with me. The boy is quite young. - You want a job? - Yes. Srikant is an old friend. And Damodar is like my son. I will have to listen to him. - Don't tell uncle about this. - Why? Because, Srikant does not like recommendations. He's mad. Even I couldn't get a job, with recommendation. Consider your job as fixed. My husband was very fond of diamonds. That is why, I wear it. Otherwise, I don't have any liking for them. Aunty, how will this look on Radha? No that. Show us the latest ones. The latest one has been bought by our owner's friend... ...see, it is in his hands. Uma, he looks like Radha's Jimmy. - Listen, is he Jimmy? - Yes, he is Jimmy, sir. Hey, Jimmy! When did you arrive? We've been waiting for you, from ages. Look who is standing. We had seen your photograph. Today we got a glimpse of you. You... - You know lnspector Damodar? - Shut up! Say Radha... I'm Damodar's wife. Oh! Sister! Greetings... Greetings. How is Damodar? He had written that he... ...is fine and had put on a lot of weight. You are very naughty. You receive letters from Radha and you name Damodar. See he is fooling us! This is not the way. You didn't even inform us about your arrival. Radha has become very weak. - Our Radha. - What? You were surprised to see us here. Now come home. Home! Radha will be happy. She has become very weak due to the separation. Have it, son. They are made of clarified-butter. - Have some more. - Let him eat in peace, Jamuna. Enough Jamuna! Enough! Son, they are over excited on seeing you. Feeling at home. I will just come. Uma, just get me... Yes, please come. See, Radha... The one for whom you were waiting for so long. See, where have we brought him from. Your love... Your lover... Your husband. You are feeling shy, are you? Why are you scared? Say hello. Hello. Where did you come from? You have put me in trouble. Come. - When did you come? - Yesterday. - Was there any problem? - No. How many days, do you intend to stay? Now I will stay here itself. What is troubling you? What do I say, Yuvraaj. I've gone crazy today. Many girls have come in my life. But this girl has... ...driven me crazy. Listen, Jaikishan. The boss has come from Delhi. He is calling you. This is Jaikishan, about whom I spoke to you. Congratulations! You have become our company's hero within a short span. I liked the suggestions which you had given about Rajdoot motorcycles. - Thank you, sir. - You have got a promotion. I never say anything wrong. Aunty, where is Radha? Aunty, where is Radha? She has gone to see the motorcycle factory with Jimmy. - With Jimmy? Alone? - I have sent her. So what? According to our traditions, we don't send the boy and girl alone... ...before marriage. This is a love marriage. And what all happens in a love marriage, before marriage... ...you must know very well. They come close to each other... And with arms around each other... This is Jimmy and he is Kishan. I am pleased to meet you. I am grateful to you for putting up an act for us. You should be grateful to Damodar... ...who made me do this. He is a very nice person. So, this is your motorbike factory. Yes, I work here. You work here! I thought, you were the owner of this factory. - I am a worker. - Worker! These are some clothes, which I bought for myself. I didn't like them. You may keep them. It is my habit to help the poor. Your clothes are too small in size, sir. Because my chest is larger than yours. Neither can I cover up my poverty with this... ...nor can your friendship glow with it. I like self-respecting people. - Is this bike yours? - Yes, it is. - Which is it? - Yamaha Rajdoot 350. It's a very nice bike. Our company's latest model. What nonsense is this, Jimmy? Don't be annoyed, darling. Jimmy is right. An Indian make is an Indian make ...and a foreign make is a foreign make. Now see his foreign junk box; how nice it is. It means, wherever you hit, there won't be a dent. Hit here, hit there, and go on hitting... Strike it anywhere, ...nothing happens. Sorry, Mr Jimmy. Your car was foreign... ...but my hand was Indian. So, your car is slightly hurt. Thank you for bringing Radha here. Now it's her wish to sit on any of the two vehicles. Radha, my vehicle is waiting for you. Call up, tomorrow morning. If you have good intentions, even the God will help you. Why, sir? - There is a good news for you. - Good news? There is a motorcycle race, from Bombay to Poona. Many motorcyclists are coming from foreign countries. Our company has selected you. They want you to take part in the Rajdoot 350 C.C. competition. Don't interrupt! The first prize is Rs. 50,000. If you win, Rajdoot will win. If Rajdoot wins, the company will win. You can build your own house then. It's a very nice horoscope. It shows that the girl is very stubborn. - That is right. - She will have a love marriage. The boy's name will start with 'J'. 'J', means Jimmy. The boy will take part in a race and will come first... and will earn fame in the whole world. He will become Radha's husband. Race! I forgot about the race. There is a motorcycle race tomorrow. I won this race in Singapore, three consecutive times. I will surely take part in this race. Take part in it and emerge victorious, son. It's a matter of our prestige. Bombay to Panvel is 30 miles. 21 motorbikes from all over the world are taking part in this race. No. 9, is Jaikishan from Escorts company. No. 16 is Mr. Jimmy Thapa from Singapore. - Greetings, uncle. - God bless you, my child. - How are you? - Where is Damodar? - Delhi. If my son-in-law wins, I will throw such a party... ...that the whole world will come to know of it. If my boy, Jaikishan wins, I'll throw such a party... ...that you will never forget. Rajdoot is invincible. My Jimmy is riding a Honda. Whether it's a Honda or anything else, the winner will be my boy. No. 16 has overtaken No. 9. Jimmy Thapa is riding No. 16. Jimmy Thapa on No. 16 has taken the lead. Buck up, Jimmy! - No. 9! - See, he is on No. 16. Let the No. 9 be damned! He is cheating. They are nearing Panvel point. No. 9 is ahead. Jaikishan is nearing the point. He is going at full-speed. Looks like it's going to be Rajdoot's victory. No 16 is determined too. The contestants are nearing the finish mark. It's a race between number 16 and 9... and the winner is number 9. "You are my heart-throb, my sweetheart." "You are my hero." This is cheating! This is partiality. They dug pits in my path and messed it up in the finish. Didn't you see it? - Don't worry, son. I've asked the priest to find an early date for your wedding with Radha. Father, you are God! You are a great man! And I'm a thief, a betrayer! I'll tell you the whole truth before Damodar returns today! What do you have to say? Go on. The truth is, I'm not the son-in-law you think I am. You are being deceived by presenting me as the son-in-law. Someone else is your real son-in-law. Who is it? - The one who won the race today. Jackie. - No! Hit me. Beat me up. I should be punished for what I've done. But the truth remains, to celebrate Jackie's Victory... a huge party has been arranged. And Jackie and Radha... will participate together on stage. You are being made... the chief guest at the programme. - I'd like to see this for myself. I will surely attend the party. I will. Has father come here? - Now look, Radha... I don't want you to sing with Kishan at the party. It'll create great trouble. - I will surely sing. Radha, your father has got to know everything. And no one except you can be the reason. No, Radha. I promise. I belong only to you. In that case, you are ruined. - I accept it. Welcome. Kishan, father is here. And he's the one who did everything. I heard everything. - God... save the honour of our love. The curtains had to rise some day. So let today be the day. "I've heard it from people." "It's there in the books." "It's just what everybody has to say..." "those in love, are never afraid." "Those who are afraid, are not in love." "Those who are afraid, are not in love." "Those in love, are never afraid." "Those who are afraid, are not in love." "Not high walls, not the strictest of security..." "Not high walls, not the strictest of security..." "even if you lay mountains and oceans in our path." "Even if you lay mountains and oceans in our path." "When has a storm ever stopped?" "When the clouds are brought to the ground." "And they say..." "Those in love, are never afraid." "Those who are afraid, are not in love." Father is very angry. He wants you to quietly go home. Or else... It's something very urgent. We've got to leave. Shall we go? "Love and fragrance, can't ever be suppressed" "if it wasn't for them, there'd be nothing." "With a pinch of vermillion, I'd take you for my wife." "What will people in the world do?" "They'll tell other people..." "just tell each other." "Those in love, are never afraid." "Those who are afraid, are not in love." This colourful evening of love... is dedicated to Mr Jaikishan and Ms Radha Mathur. The first prize in the competition goes to Mr Jaikishan and Radha Mathur. Call everyone out. Tell Damodar to return by this evening's flight. Yes, it's important. Do tell him. Brother! I know, you mustn't have slept because of what happened last night. So I've come to you. - Every threat of yours... will be answered today, Jackie Dada. What have you come to say? No, sir. I remember, it was this very day of Lord Krishna's birthday... that I came to you as a demon. I was Jackie then. But I'm Jaikishan today. It's your daughter Radha who turned me into Jaikishan, from the demon I was. It's thanks to her love that I have mustered the courage today... to seek your daughter's hand from you. Do you know the punishment for setting foot in this house? I've borne enough punishment, sir. And I'm willing to take any punishment. You will now see the last punishment I give you. Brother! - No! What are you doing? - Stay where you, Jamuna! No, Uncle. Don't do that. At least consider the honour of your house! This is the scoundrel who has insulted the honour of my house! He has snatched my daughter from me. I'm not sparing him! Yes, he's the one who has snatched your daughter from you. So make a sieve out of him... go ahead! But remember, your bullet will first hit your own daughter! Radha has always belonged to Krishna. Who has ever separated her from him? She will live and die with him. What are you going? At least think about me! Wretch! Your father has arrested a thousand killers. And you want to turn him into a killer today? You talk back at my brother? For this criminal! Criminal? He's not the criminal, all of you are... who are stopping him from becoming a good human being. You're forcing him to be evil! - Wretch! You make a nice man out of him. Go away... Get out! You're dead as far as we're concerned! - Go on. Run away with him! No one's stopping you! - Yes. I'll go away with him. Right now. Let's go, Kishan. No, Radha. I'm not taking you away like this. Mother, if I had to elope with Radha, I'd have done it two years ago. When I take her away this time, it'll be with pride and respect. Pride? People from decent families have pride... not those with rotten blood in their veins! Because those born bastards, I call thugs! Father! I'm sorry for giving you respect. You don't deserve it. My parents were poor, no doubt. But they were better human-beings than you are. They knew how to give respect to even an enemy who came to their house. I beg of you, Kishan... Please go away. Please leave! I'll go away. But he has abused my parents and my parentage... I'll never step in this house again. I'll never meet Radha again. Never. I came to ask for Radha's hand... I didn't come to beg for her! He gave us a stinging slap, didn't he? Show some shame, wretch! Don't to this, father. He has given enough tests in love with me. He's really a very nice man. If he's turned down, people will lose faith in love. We have spent each year pining for each other... only because we cared for your respect. Father, I beg for my love... please give me my love. And you... you repay your father like for years of his love? This is how you repay me for my love? Speak... tell me! Tell her that her father's dead for her. He's dead! "May you be impaired, O wicked world." "You have broken hearts that were in love." "A wall of modesty..." "you have built." "Oh, what a long separation." "On my lips is a cry for mercy." "Oh, what a long separation." "In a love of a few days..." "what a long separation..." We have decided to get Radha and Jimmy married. Call from Singapore. Speak on. - Sure. Mr Singh! Jimmy here! - Go ahead. Have you received my wedding invite? - Yes, I have. I was the happiest to see your wedding card. Srikant isn't just your relative now. He's my relative too. That's exactly why I'm getting married to her, partner. You're coming to Bombay, aren't you? - Not only me... all of us are coming as the bridegroom's guests! With a band in tow! I get it. Besides, I've got to meet another relative too. Don't drink so much, Jackie. For God's sake... please! You...? Do come... please sit down. Jaikishan, I've got to know everything, son. You want to drink, don't you? Go on... drink all you want to. You know? Drink some more. - Sure... I will drink so much that the blood in my body comes to my throat... and ultimately out of my mouth! With that blood... I'll write outside Srikant's bungalow: "Radha". Wonderful! So you've given up even before the battle has begun? I haven't given up, sir. I haven't. Ever since my parents have died, I've been fighting it out. As Jaikishan and Jackie Dada. My name kept changing, the people changed too... but not my destiny, sir. It never changed. Know what, Bharatji? The fun that is in being Jackie Dada... is not in being Jaikishan. Jackie Dada... a thug! A thug Srikant called me! He called me a thug! Yes, I'm a thug Srikant! A thug! I don't want your daughter! Do you think I'll beg for her? So what if I'm a poor orphan? I've lived life on my own terms! I've always had courage! I have a lot of strength... Although the invitation to Radha's wedding have been sent out... this chap Jimmy... I don't like his character. - That's what my department thinks too. You were right, Damodar. I've got a report on Jimmy from the lntelligence Department. He's a smuggler and he's connected with a Singapore-based gang. This is the file. We'll arrest him as soon as we have the evidence. This is a lie! All right, I'm a liar, Damodar is a liar... the C.I.D. is a liar and only my friend Srikant speaks the truth! But how will... - Why're you angry? Just stay quiet. If our son-in-law is a smuggler, our house will be stacked with narcotics... we'll be millionaires and our daughter will be very happy... it'll bring glory to our family name... - Bharatji! Oh yes? Do you get it? A criminal cannot be my son-in-law. This wedding can't take place. Jimmy, a smuggler can't become my son-in-law. I'm calling off this wedding. Had it not been for the... respect I command, I'd have punished you for this betrayal. No... Jimmy! What have you done? Have you gone mad? Calm down. I'll be back. Look at what Jimmy's done. This is just what I feared. Send my guests upstairs. I'll handle the rest. He swallowed the pills the doctor had forbidden him, sir. Sir, Srikant has called off Jimmy's wedding. What does this say? Sir, this is the girl we had carried away with Jackie. Jackie's at the bottom of all this trouble, sir. Jackie? I want Jackie right now. I want Jackie... dead or alive. "You are my sweetheart." "A world made of stone... and hearts made of stone too." "A beloved of stone... but I will take you, as you are." "I agree." Billa? Come. Billa, I can't fight anymore. I've had enough of fights. Jackie Dada! Lovers belong not on earth, they belong in the heavens. And what's this? Give it to me. Don't touch it, Billa. Don't touch it! "For this evening..." "in the name of our love." We've driven the bastards away. - We've finished them all! Let's take him to a doctor first. We'll talk later. This is Jaikishan's friend, Radha. He has met with a serious accident. He's at Nanavati Hospital right now and he can die at any moment. No. - Come immediately. Leave the rest of the programme to me. Where are you going, you mad girl? Is someone there...? Listen to me, you crazy girl! Stop the car, driver. What's happening here? - A fit of madness, mister. Please help me. - Come with me. I'll take you home. I hate people making a noise. Just keep mum. There's no danger, but it'll take him some time to regain consciousness. You do know Pasha's language. Your sister's and your daughter's honour is in my hands. And my honour is in your hands. Three of my friends are arriving on a flight from Singapore this evening. They're carrying a few bags. It's up to you to get them through the customs and the police. Let's see your bags. Stop there! Srikant has betrayed us. All the contraband and our men have been caught. I heard it all. I swear. Where is Srikant's daughter? - She's with Jimmy. Ask Jimmy to give her such a nice treatment... that Srikant remembers Pasha's terminology for ever. Even if a man turns a demon in love, he's justified. Bastard! I'll hack you to pieces if you even touch my girl! Take the poor woman inside and give her a few more diamonds. She'll shut up on her own. - Get lost, you scoundrel! You can't buy me out! I wouldn't accept anything from you! Don't you rant too much, old hag. - Old hag...? Your old mother's an old hag. So's every woman in your family! If I don't make mincemeat of you, I won't be Jamuna! Who do you think you are? - Take the old hag away. English dog! Face me alone! If I don't play the music for you, I won't be Jamuna! Dog! Cur! You ask your sidekicks to harass me? Who do you think you are...? - Shut the old hag inside! No... Jimmy, if you even try to touch me, I'll kill myself! No, you can't kill yourself because your sweetheart's lying in hospital. And I have a video of his. The arrival of video in India has made crime even easier. Did Kaka do that? - Yes. By having Pasha's men caught, he has created a huge problem for Radha. Come with me. - One moment. You can't achieve this as a police inspector. Bengali, go to the hospital and take care of Jackie. Not a word to him. Kishan's breathing his last in hospital. Take a good look. When I can bring a video of his from the hospital... I can even finish him. - No... you won't do that! Just a telephone call from me and Kishan will die. No, Jimmy! Do not be so merciless! I beg at your feet! I'll do just as you say. But you mustn't do anything to Kishan. You must do nothing. You will now do as I say. Everything has gone wrong, Jackie Dada. You've messed it up, Kaka! - Whatever I did was right. I can lay down my life for my daughter, but not my integrity. So prepare to lay down your life. You know how to get to Radha, don't you? - Yes, nobody else knows. In that case, carry him there like you carried Radha earlier. Don't get excited... I'm going with you too. But I'll go there in disguise. Every time you have donned a disguise, you have failed, Inspector. Well done, my boys! Welcome, Srikant! You wanted me to hang, didn't you? You will now see how I hang you. As for Jimmy, he'll be delighted to see you. I'm not sparing that rotten Jimmy. Bring him before me. I'll give him such a beating... he'll turn into a rabbit. - Who's he? He appears to be a fraud, sir. When we were following the I.G... we found him abducting the I.G. and whisking him away. And we brought the two of them to you. By God. By bringing Satan here, you have invited your death. By God! But who are you? Jimmy was supposed to get married today. Among the passengers from Singapore was a friend of mine. Farooq. He was carrying diamonds worth 20 million belonging to me. He and my diamonds were caught, so I caught hold of this I.G. I will now demand a price for his life from the Indian Government. You are mister... Even if you wear glasses, you won't be able to see the truth about me. Here's my passport. I've loved disguises ever since I was a child. But this is full and final appearance. My real name if Janab lrfaan Pakhtuni. I ran away from Afghanistan... - I think he's a fraud. And I think he's a joker. But that's all right. Srikant will die in tears... and this man will die laughing. Incomparable! "This is devastation, this is elegance..." "this is mischief, this is a grouse." "This is nobility, this is ill-will..." "this is a request, this is a prayer." "This is love." "love..." "this is love." "It's called but a mere drop of dew..." "but there's a storm in this drop." "This is love." "He who clashes with it..." "shall regret it." "He will be shattered." "He who blocks love's path..." "is a naive man." "This is love." "A heart is meant to love." "everything else is false. Love is true." "What is God...? He's all about love." "God lives in hearts..." "that nurture love." "This is love." "This is devastation, this is a grouse..." "this is a prayer, this is a rebellion." "This is love..." Jackie, take Radha away. I'll go and rescue Kaka. - No. Radha is father's honour. You take care of her. Wait. Freeze, Pasha. - The tables have turned. What? Jackie, don't forget... Pasha is the one who taught you this language. Come to me. Come... Rotten scoundrel! Take her away. Watch it. "You are my beloved..." "you are my sweetheart." There's no news? Ask lnspector Shine to give me a call in another 15 minutes. God... don't snatch my daughter from me. She's the only child I have. My child! Radha! What are you watching? Call the doctor! Open your eyes... Don't be afraid. Your daughter is all right. Wait, Jaikishan. It's I who should bow his head to you, son. It took me a lot of time to get to know you. I thought you were of no consequence compared to our reputed family. But it was petty of me to think like that. We gave birth to Radha, no doubt. But you have given her a new lease of life... by saving her life and her honour. Will you go away all alone? Won't you take your Radha with you? Father! My son! How a man can change in love, I realise today. And that realisation makes you our hero. And remember. Forget what "used to" be... and take him for what he is now. "You are my beloved..." "you are my sweetheart..." "you are the hero of my love-story." Subtitle synced by Anomix33
