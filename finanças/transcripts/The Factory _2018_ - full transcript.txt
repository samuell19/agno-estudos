GUARD: Stupid dog! GUARD: Didn't feed you? Everytime on foot? In summer - okay, and now it's six kilometers in the cold... It's okay. - And the bus is for who? - It's a lot of noise. Sedoy They won't raise the paycheck. Which they wouldn't take away. Soon we'll be working like dogs for a bowl of porridge. - I'm fucking tired - Vovka, pump it up. This shit again. I was up all night. Neighbor, bitch, repairs at night. He drills, he knocks. He's drilling your wife, Terekhov. - What'd you say? - You heard me. Stop whining. You've been talking about repairs for three months, after she went to Frolygin, like we didn't know. Hey, Ryaboy, you gonna shut your mouth or you want me to weld it? no time for repairs - they need to fuck enough. You didn't fuck her yourself, so she went to the neighbor. And Frolygin is a famous fucker. In the pool he comes, all the women are wetting themselfes. He's skinny, but his dong tearing up swimmers. I swear. - I'm fucking sick of your shit ! Quiet! Settle this after work. Konstantin Dmitrievich, how is that so? Didn't warn us. We'd have met you properly. Dust, dirt, you know. What about the helmet? Oh, come on. What are you guys standing there for? Hurry up and bring it. Konstantin Dmitrievich, why don't you put mine on, huh? Well, what if something happens production after all. And here we are, you see what's going on. Pull up! Quiet you! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! - Will you let me finish? - What are you yelling at us for? We work till the end of the month and that's it. - Is that clear to everyone? - What's that, huh? - Quiet! Calm down! Calm down! Stop grumbling ! Let me speak ! There's no money now. I'll pay you when i get them. - When will it be? - Six months, no later. - Quiet! I said, quiet! Quiet! Six months, that's all! They always paid! Aren't you scared of a strike? I'm not scared. Do you? - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet, I asked for it! Quiet! I promise we'll make a deal. When they didn't pay? Everybody to your stations! Let's get everybody to their stations! -What is this? What's to be done? We need to figure out why they're closing. What's there to deal with? You were told that the factory is unprofitable! Well, what now? On the streets like dogs? We have rights too. What fucking rights are you talking about? Who are you, the owner? A factory was built under the Soviets. And Kalugin bought it for almost nothing, when the factory was privatized. - I've been here since '85. - So what? And from Kalugin, "fuck you." you don't agree! Oh right, let's draw posters, let's go on a hunger strike. And then the cops are gonna have us out of here in a week. - All right, guys, see you tomorrow. - Well, what now, silently go home? RYABOY: Think with your head. Get sick leave, shake a leg and look for work! Who's gonna take me? a 50 year old locksmith ? - That's your problem. - Do you think they'll take you? - We'll see about that. - Well, well. A loader in the stall. The machine-tool factory is stalling, the tractor factory is stalling, the electrical appliance factory was shut down a week ago. The powerplant about to stop - there's nonting to power. In the whole region, only the chemical plant and the oil refinery remained. They've been firing people since the fall. All vacancies are occupied. - How do you know? - I cheched. A year ago, it was clear they were gonna close all this. We have to rob him. Stop his car, take him at gunpoint and shake the money. - Who? - He's downtown on Fridays. going into town to do business with the mayor. Then he's taking highway to home. There's a guard and a driver in the car, he's in the back. The road is empty by night. We're blocking with two trucks, take him, bring him in here and press him. He's calling his bitches, we have money coming in. And Tashkent.(we cool) Sedoy, what the fuck? What are you mumbling about, what trucks? Which Tashkent? What, you're gonna fuck HIM up? Boy, this isn't the front. Haven't fought for a long time? Who the hell is this about? About Kalugin. What the fuck guys ? It's a prison. That's bullshit. Okay, guys, think. There's time. There's gonna be a lot of time now. So? I'm in. - Are you serious? - What do you mean? - Do you understand what you're suggesting? - I understand. - And what happens if...? - Ryaboy. Let's not "if." Alright I'm in. Do you know how to pull ? The army taught me. The army. Puyj? Ninka is giving birth soon The older daughter is knocked up, doesn't work, doesn't study. Six mouths to feed. Ah, fuck it... Well, what about you, Ivan Ivanovich? Oh, guys... It's not gonna end well. Fuck it. - If i'm any use to you... - Six are not five. We need a guns. Who's the hunter? I've got an old double barrel. It's been a while, but it's working. Mayakin has a Saiga, I can ask. Two cops AKSU, sawed-off, 3 mags and a PM. - Where from. - Dashing youth. We need to go big. I want enough for my grey hairs. If we succeed - we have to lay lower then ever. we'll be living in a dugout for the first time. Kalugin is above the governor. Connections right up to the top, Federals, cops, whoever you want. Good. Thursday night, we'll collect the guns, we'll check it the point, discuss what and how. We're doing it Friday night. Do as I say, and it's fine. They're on their way! Here we go! - Why are they crawling? - Who? Trucks, don't you see? ravines on the sides. Push it, Andrew, we need to get through this. Are you drunk or something? - What, slow down? - Will you drive through it? - What do they want? - They want to check the license. - What are you doing, asshole? What are you, a jerk? You asshole! - What's there to do? - Come out and ask. Come here. - Why not security guard? Do you want to live? - Yes. - Do you have a gun? - I am the driver. Now you're going back, telling Kalugin to get out. If the guard rushes through... - This is for you, Konstantin Dmitrich. - I have already understood. WHERE... Put him in the back room. On the floor. Give me a chair, damn it. The floor's ice-cold. Bring a chair. Nothing to do? Go to the gate. Mm-hmm. - Did you get hit? - No. - Your pants are dry, won't you catch a cold? - Fuck you. - Why did you start shooting, asshole? - Oh, just to scare. You scared him? Nothing, let him jump on one leg now, bitch. The fuck ? You can shoot when I say so. Do you understand? Aren't you fucking with me? Maybe I'll decide for myself. You won't! I'm the only one with experience here! Your gangster showdown is bullshit, kid, forget it! Well, you know, I wasn't chasing girls down the street either! You almost ruined it! He came out with a gun, he was told... KALUGIN: How long are you gonna keep yelling? What do you need ? You call whoever you want to call, he's bringing in the money, and we're letting you go. Is that all ? That's all. No tricks. I'll kill you. Dad, is Mom sick? Why aren't you sleeping? Let's go. Come on, lie down. Lie down, come on. Yes, Konstantin Dmitrich. After chemo. Yeah, we haven't slept in two days. What? Hello. Yes, it's me. I know, 1:00 in the morning. Gather everyone. - Why aren't you at the station? There are more people there. - I don't know, it seems empty. - Did you opened the gate? - No. Tuman, where's the security? There's a guard in the booth drunk. He'll be knocked out till morning. We need to cut off his phone line - in case he'll wake up. - Will do. - How many are there? - I don't know. - How'd they get him? - Ambush on the road. - Are the guys alive? - One guy kind of got hurt. I called, but he's not answering. How's it going with you? What's the "how"? Cut it out, Tuman. It's not good. Chemo didn't help. Metastases, six months maximum. Anyway, the money's in my trunk. Secure the perimeter and wait. Fifth channel. Are you going alone? Ryaboy. - Can I come in ? - Don't be fidgety. - Where's the money? - Where's the Kalugin? Come out. Good night, Konstantin Dmitrievich. Hello, Anton. How are you feeling? Tolerable. - How's Lena? - Later. Why don't you kiss him? Where is the money? - In the trunk. - Where's the trunk? Don't be nervous, man. I'm not stupid. You see, I come here with a bag, and you've already... took the money, killed me. Is that a good one? - There he is, alive. - Now I see. Let's do it this way. I'm coming back with the money and leaving with him. Just so you know, I have people outside. If you're up to something... ...no one will let you out alive. You're taking him, we're going out, and you shoot all of us at point-blank range. Is that a good one? I'm not stupid either. Bring us the money. We're gonna put him in a truck, to bus station on the corner. In an hour you will pick it up. - Alive? - You didn't bring any cops, did you? Just like we agreed. Go on. And i'm not your friend. Freeze! Cops! Hands in the air! On your knees! Hands! Hands up! Hands where I can see them, bitch! Open it up! - You're a cunt, you brought them! - Shut up! He's got a hostage there. You go in, he's dead! Bring negotiator with radio in half an hour in half an hour! Close it! Hold it right there! Close it! Okay, be aware! To your places! Get upstairs, make sure they don't get in from the roof. Guard the stairs. God damn, if they go in from behind. Watch the gate! And take it off the auto! - Teryokhov go in the back! - Got it. Keep the mags close by! Count the bullets! Everyone in this workshop, listen carefully. The perimeter of the workshop is cordoned off. Come out one by one. Guns to the ground. We have the right to shoot to kill. Yes, they will. Look, if they try to climb in, they will need this window. Watch it closely, got that ? Don't fuss too much. Keep looking at it once in a minute, and that's enough. Can you handle it? Face down, I told you! Face... Attention! You are surrounded. I repeat, you're surrounded. I suggest we surrender voluntarily. We guarantee your safety. Don't harm the hostage. - If there's anything happens with him, take his place. I repeat, do not harm the hostage. Freeze! - Take it easy. - Shut up, asshole! Face towards the wall, you fuck! Don't move! - Tuman, what the hell? - Face away, you fuck! - Who's in charge? - Shut your mouth! Take it easy. Captain Dadakin, special rapid response team. What's the purpose of you being on the factory grounds with a guns? - What's your purpose? - Oh, man! - Do i need to repeat the question? - Captain, I heard. We're from private security, working for Kalugin. We have a permit for weapons. What are you doing here? Why don't you show me the papers? - Guys, who's got the papers with them? - I didn't take it. - I didn't take it either. - I don't have it now. Check it. - Where? - Inside pocket. Private security company "Glock". - Sanych, this is Kalugin's P.S.C. - I know. - Whose? - Kalugin's. - What with Kalugin? - I don't get it. You got it all. Here in the workshop. There's six masked men with guns in there. I don't know who. They called, told me the amount, I brought it in. Only we agreed not to have any cops. What happens now, you think about it. I see. - Let them go. - At ease, boys. - Go home, get warm. - Give me the guns back. - Give it to him or he'll cry. - Why are you here? - An anonymous call came in, that Kalugin was taken hostage. They have been holding here since the evening. We called his house, he didn't come back. I gathered the team and came here. And here's the thing, citizens, let's get one more thing straight. There's a hostage situation here, and it's... - This is our business, not yours. - What? Shans, land him. Cool him down. - I don't get it. - You got it, captain. - What the hell are you doing? - Hello? Dim. - Yes, I am. - I'm talking to you. Yeah. Why so late? Your boys tied us up. Yeah, at the factory. That's right, and Kalugin is here. Can I have it back? No, I didn't call. It was all good, I got a deal, and then... Thank you. I get it. Let's make up our minds, huh? I need to take Kalugin out. Explain it to the man. Why go home? We were standing here. Take it, Captain, is it warm or something? Guys. Yes. Captain Dadakin. Yes, Comrade Colonel. A... and the rules of procedure? What am I supposed to do with them? I see. Yeah, Dim. Yeah, well, everyone's got a job to do. It's okay, we'll figure it out. Bye. Captain, you heard the whole thing. Let's do this way. I'm in charge here, and you stay out of the way for now. We're gonna take Kalugin out now, and you can take them. No offense. - What are we gonna do about it, Sanych? Well, that's good. Okay, guys, calm down. Well? - And who called the cops? - Do I know? - Here. - Thank you. Veseliy. Go get the bag. I don't get it, they don't need it, neither do we. Kalugin don't need it also, then who is it? Maybe someone saw it by accident. They didn't call the local cops, right into the special forces. Thats like 200 kilometers away. And right after we get here? That's a weird little call. - Come on, what's the big guess? - What did you see? - Amatuers. - Are you sure? Everybody's looks worried, veal eyes, bad posture. There is tought one, with no eye. Gunshot i think. He speaks clearly, he's never lost his breath... - Hey, stop! Fuck! ...the hands don't shake, holds the gun right. - You darning bastard! - Suck it... He's their leader. - Get your car away... - Hey, dog, come here! What you were told to do? - Get your car away! - They asked for a negotiator. - I heard. Get to the highway, take boys back. They'll freeze here. - Get your fucking car away!. - Shut your mouth. - Did you bring the money? - Cops aren't with me With who then, us? They arrived to get sick? - You don't have to believe it. - I don't. - So what are we gonna do? - You tell me! No one here wants to go to jail! - The cops don't decide anything. - Really? KALUGIN: Of course. - Shut up! - So it's still on? - Yes. - Good one. - Oh, my God, don't screw it up! I don't fucking need them in this sitiation! It's us who don't fucking need them! And you need it to outman us! You pulled quite a performance here. Lights, handcuffs... You hold us for morons! Okay, what do you want? Leave the money, me and the men will think about it. Change your mind? Sixth channel. Ugh. What the fuck is this? ?They're not with me.? Then where did they come from ? Did they come here by smell? Well, maybe Kalugin has a beacon up his ass. Maybe somebody saw us on the road. Who? The road was empty, it's night. - What if Filin woke up? - I checked, he was sleeping like a baby. Horse dose. Filin would've been here first thing. Oh, come on. He calles the cops, that's clear. They're working for him. Otherwise, he'd be cuffed in a van, and I'd be talking to a cop, not with him. Well, Anton's not stupid either. He was told, without cops. - He knows what the risks are. CALUGIN: - Exactly! Shut up in there! It's a deal. They brought in the money, we exchanged, ran off. What's the problem? We need to talk with the cops, to set the conditions. What are you gonna set them? This Anton is in charge of them. We gotta give up, guys, before we get killed. Ooh, do i smell shit? You don't have kids. And I have three. - Well, why the fuck you sing up to this? - I forgot to ask you! - Call Mom, dung pie. - I'm gonna blow your head off, asshole! Enough of this! IVANICH: We need to think about it and you're fighting. What to do, Sedoy? Sedoy. What's the matter with you? Nothing's changed. Let's do as planned. We'll take the money, Kalugin under the guns, we go out and... - And they cuff us. What do you mean? - If the cops interrupt, what are we gonna do? - They won't! What if? - We kill Kalugin. - Are you sure? Exactly. We kill him, we'll go to jail. If we don't kill him, we'll go too. He figured it out, and he dragged the cops. That's it. The DA... ...and TV journalists. And let him tell on camera how the factory is falling apart. CALUGIN: Wow! What kind of benefit do you get? Well, your bitches gonna get your tail pinned down and they're not gonna be snooping around. Well, you're gonna sing about our miserable share. Well, I might sing it. You are going to jail anyway. So what. But we're ideological justice fighters. the sailors from the ?Aurora?. Only you kidnapped a man and the guard was shot. You're already in jail. So we're not bandits, we are rebellious workers. And when they show us on TV. we're gonna be heroes at all. Well, they're gonna cut it down for ideology. Sedoy, what are you saying? - Clever. - The hell! Instead of money and freedom. they're gonna show us on TV and throw cage? - I was already there, I didn't like it. - What freedom? There are the cops behind the gate! They won't let us out of here anyway! - Anton's gonna say it, and they're gonna let us out. - Will he say so? RYABOY: Are you serious? He's offering bullshit! Anyway, who doesn't agree takes Kalugin and goes ahead. SEDOY: Maybe you can make it to front gates. Fuck the money. Since we got caught,... ...if prison, then prison. I agree. I don't know, it's kind of a good one. Cossack? What's there to think about, men? Why are you listening to him? Take the money! Who do we need to listening ? You? You even got dumped by your bitches. -I'm coming in. Positions. You decided? Sanych, look. They won't took it ? Why? - Where's Funny? - He went to the highway, you sent him. Well? They want journalists and prosecutor. And for Kalugin to confess on camera that he is dumping the factory. - Why the fuck? - Workers. The factory was shut down, so they decided to take theirs. Okay, now they're afraid the cops are gonna be with us, and they won't let go. - Kalugin says what? - He says do what you have to do. What do you think? - It was kind of weird with cops. They showed up - now it's hard to get rid of them. - Where to? Hey! - Okay, guys, take it easy. Take it easy. - Those guys losing their shit - We wanted to be quiet, and here... ...is Captain Dadakin. Found it. One of them's fine, the other one is lightly injured in the leg. I took him to the hospital. Well,what will happen to Kalugin, if he tells about the factory on camera? Nothing's gonna happen. That's his factory, wants - opens, wants - closes. Go ahead and agree. Alright. They're gonna get a gig they wanted. Do you receive guests? Sure. As you ordered. Have some courage. Prosecutor, news. Get to work. Can I get the lamp right here? The light is good. - Is it okay here? - It's okay. Bring him out. Show me the badges. I know you. - Katya, come here. - Ah? What "ah"? Let's shoot. Check the mic. - Say something. - Shit. Thank you. We are working. We are in the workshop of the concrete goods factory, owned by the biggest businessman of our region, Konstantin Kalugin. After bankruptcy, the workers took the owner hostage, of Konstantin Dmitrievich himself, actually. And now we have a unique possibility to get comments from the participants in the event. Konstantin Dmitrievich how are you feeling? As you can see. What, and most importantly, why is it happening tonight at this factory? The fact is that the region has a difficult sales situation of this factory's production. There's hardly any housing construction. And more often than not, it's a monolithic struc... Why are you twisting your neck? Tell us everything in order. Be brave. You tell me, bitch, how in 20 years you haven't bought a machine, a bolt, a fucking wire. And you fine the workers for breakdowns. You've got people working for 12 hours or even two shifts for a penny. on that old shit. Not that you haven't added a rouble, you don't pay for three months. Tell us how your "Ejhi" gang bought all the companies in the region in the 90s. Tell us about the forest behind Kisva, where you buried competitors and disagreeable people in packs. About your friends who are sitting in the Duma now and having your back. And about your governor, that you promoted. to keep the whole area under the boot. Why aren't you talking? Go on. Hold the gate. - Shapito, fuck! - Calm down. And then what were you going to do? What did you tell us? "We came here to dance for the morons, and go home"? Where are the morons? He has more convolutions in his head than ours! How are you even gonna trick him? Did you think you brought a camera, a girl from the TV, and that's it... he's gonna clap his fucking hands and let everyone go? Buy him a lollipop! He's gonna be here until all this is on the air! Shut your mouth. You've been paid, you've come. You stood, waved your badges. What are the questions? What if he had shot us now, clowns? Have you seen him? He's paranoid! The killer! - Oh, fuckin' hell, here we go! Bitch! That's it, he's done. - What are you doing? Stop it! - Just calm down already. Stop it. - Stop fucking around! - Brake them out! - Hold him down. - Okay, come on, come on. - Wait. - I'm just gonna watch? Hey,look what's going on. Where to? Get back! - Halt! Quiet! - Here we go! Stop! Stop right there! This is an order! Where to? Stop right there! Faggot! What's up, asshole? What ? - What, who shot? - Enough man. Stop this mess. Come on, men. - All right, guys. - Have a rest, guys. Count your teeth. The rain will wash away the shit. - Fuck this, let's go. - Let's go. - Ponomar, are you okay? - Alive. I'm driving. Funny. - It's okay. - Andreich. It's okay. We brougth those assholes down. Well, I'm going to jeb him, and he's jumping at me. I'm going left and back to his right. I'm going back, and punching him with my left, right into his chest. Sorry, Captain. Nerves. Come on, come on. What are you guys, anyway? Didn't you hear the order? Or have you forgotten your charter? - It's okay. - They crossed the line. Captain. That's it, to your positions. They'll gonna go in, and we her busy talking Don't fuck with me. What court do you setup here? Sedoy, don't overdo it. It'll break. Well, you see, the more he says, the less they'll give us. We're miserable workers, and he's a thief and a killer. - They're gonna show it on TV, that's all. - Yeah, they showed it, wait! We needed the money from him, the money came in! And what do you thinking? I'm telling you, you can't trust them. Now we're fooled! - What if they kill you behind the fence? - This shit again! And if he confesses, we'll be forgiven, won't we? Who needs us all dirty? We're gonna be fucking forgotted in a week! After the first blue-ass scandal! Then in jail they gonna rape us and cut us in a showers Let's get the money and get out of here! No, Sedoy's right. And if we are killed? I have children. Fuck you and your children! Are you going to help them out of jail, wage-earner? - What's to be done? - Nothing. Go to your position. The cops are leaving! Back to your positions. - He sent cops away! - Get back to yor position! What position? The cops sent away. Let's take the money and go! I said, back to your position! It's a bait! Who the fuck are you listening to him? He's a fucking crazy! He's been chasing demons every night! Fuck this. Enough! - Where are you going? - Wherever i need, it's not the army! - I said stop! - Take a chance! You're such a cunt, Ryaboy. There's 20 guns in there. Everyone here is on the account. - I'd better be a cunt than an dumbass. - They won't let you down. - You don't think about us, think about yourself. - Fuck you. - Get out of here, you jerks! - Ryaboy, don't be silly! Suck on it! Shithead Guys! - I'm out. - I can see that. Okay, I'm out of the picture. Does the gun helps? Put your hands down. Why alone? The rest of them are stupid. So you're smart one, huh? Guys, I'm in favor of making sure everything's okay. How's that? No one wanted a riot. Everybody signed up for the money. And then cops showed up from somewhere. Then Sedoy came up with all this stuff with a TV... - Who's the Sedoy one? - Well, with whom you... - What about you? - What about me? I wish I had my share. You guys, you know, well, there's no more work to do, where to now? So I signed up. Well, you guys are serious, you can see right away. The others haven't figured it out yet, and I knew as soon as the cops left, so... - Want some money? - No, of course not. I'd rather leave alive and won't end up in a cell. I'll figure it out something. Good one. - Well, I'm gonna go? - Wait a minute. Of course you're good. There's five more, and we're gonna clean it up. Do you know where they live? Who? I thought you said you weren't stupid. Guys, come on. - What, you want to... - What we want is our business. But what does it have to do with women and children? Well, as you wish. Funny. Move your ass. Jump in. Seventh. Do not kill. Let's go take a look around, shall we? What news? They're doing a story. Going on the air in the morning. - Uh, uh, where are you going? - Calm down, old man. My ass is asleep. Where am I gonna run off to? - What's your name? - Sedoy. - Okay, you got a name? - Have you asked that before? Fella. I'm not a ghoul. Oh, yeah? Well, if the factory was profitable, would I bankrupt it? Nobody wants these concrete plates, Do i have to marinade them? I heard you. I know what you mean, where can you go now? It's hard for workers, it's hard. Well, I see you're crying when you threw 300 people out on the street. You don't make me sorry for you. We have lived different lives. The well-fed don't understand the hungry... You know. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to have brains and powers. When other drank vodka and whined, i was working like a bull. And I've been near death as much as you did. Which one of you doesn't want to live humanly? I see how honest you are. When it came to this you became simple bandits. You don't have to be fidgety. We didn't want to take a penny from a hard worker. Don't make a poor mouth. ?Not profitable? That's your excuse? What are we worse than you? You're have everything and we're eating the dick without salt. You know how people live, you bastard? Ripping veins for a penny to make a living. Hopeless people climbing the wall. And you're talking about harder life. If it weren't for the men, if I didn't have to get out of this shit, I'd strangle you with my own hands. and looked into your eyes while you were squirming. Get out of here. I don't want to hear your fucking voice anymore. Get out of here. Open the gate. - I don't get it. - Open it. We have something to discuss. Terekhov. On the floor! - What's in there? - I don't know. Won't explode? SEDOY. What the fuck? Is it fun? Look inside. Wait. And if there's... Well, let me see. We can do it without me, but can't do it without you. - Vitya, don't take any chances. - And I am not taking any chances. Born with the sivler spoon. The zipper... ...very carefully. If you feel resistance, it's a trigger. That's it ? - Did it seem like it? - Okay, come on, go away, I'll do it myself. Okay, don't be a pussy. Vitya! What's the matter with you? It's the Ninkin's. - Oh, really? - What are you smiling about, puppy? These are my wives underwear. And her jacket. And this is Ninkin's. Petka's sneakers. His shirt. Olga's Sweater . I gave it myself. Whose is this? It's my mother's robe! Where to? Get back in your place! Well, well, well And they found mine, freaks. Ivan Ivanovich, maybe you should see what's yours. Well, I don't think so. I haven't seen my son or grandson in 20 years. - What the hell is this, Sedoy? CALUGIN: You know what it is. They know, where you live. Should I continue? Ryaboy, bitch, he turned us in! Didn't kill the bastard! - Oh, come on! What have I done, idiot! My children... Come on, I said! Sedoy. - We have to quit. - Not yet started. No, I'm serious. The hint is clear. That's not what we were doing. I will not risk my mother. Don't risk it, I'm not holding you. I'm leaving, too. As you wish. Terekhov? Sedoy, i`m not even gonna cry for that bitch. Let them gangbang her. But children... It's come a long way, Alex. Think about it. I thought it over. Anyone who wants is free. - Let him go, Sedoy. - What are you crying about? Cut it out! - Let him go. Sedoy, show some humanity. How's that? Give it up? They're gonna kill woman and kids! Why are you so stubborn about this confession? I've explained it already. We are gonna be dead as soon as we walk out of here. What about the kids? They're your kids, not mine. Sedoy. Get the hell out of here! Ah, stop it! If you won't let go... ...I'll kill you. Did you learn how to kill, soldier? - Vovka, what are you doing? - Shut your mouth! Get out of here, you jerk. And take that weeper with you. You bitch! Easy! Sedoy, no. Get up, you jerk. - Fuck! - Vovka! Okay, stop it! Vovka, how are you, kid? Vovka... Volodya, we have to break the roof. - Got it. ANTON: Ponomar, guard the exit. Funny, go in. On it. Keep an eye on him. Uh-huh. Oh, fuck. Bitch. Look at the containers, here somewhere. Oh, fuck! - What are you doing? - Can't see shit. What if he's in our backs? Or do you want to get into this shit? Fuck. Funny. Done. Let's go. Seventh! What have you got? What a bitch. - Where is he? - Above us! Seventh got killed. We won't get him. He's at home here. - Tuman, we have to go! - I know! Get out of here. Lungs? Breathe slowly. That's my end, Alexey. - That's it. - Don't grumble, Cossack. You've done some work. - Little... - What are you talking about? You're evil, Alexey. Evil. How is he? Dead. What did he say? He's sorry for Vovka. Oh, I'm done now. Don't whine. Cossack's dead. Open up. Why? Open up, god damn it - Got any wounded? - Leg. Cure your dead! There they are lying behind the stoves! Thank you, Anton. I pulled you out of the mud for something You paid for all the good things. Thank you. You're welcome. - Are you scared for your life? - And you are for yours? What did I tell you to do, bitch? Would you like some sedative, Konstantin Dmitrich? ? ???? ??? ?sedative?! I'm gonna give you ?sedative? ! You're gonna rot at the gas station as a guard! You have to get out of here first. - What? - Easy! Let me go! Well, goodbye. - Are you sure about that? - There are three of you, two of us. At least I'm leveling the playing field. You're not gonna get a chance. - And no options. - Options? I thought that was them. Well, you're not a dandelion. You do realize that Constantine Dmitrich and I have been working for a long time. The shit we cleaned up after him! I'm goind down into the pit with him. You're already in the pit. Get the money and go. There is no other way out. There is, Anton! There is! I'm gonna call the D.A. myself right now! Whose side are you on? Mine! As you say. Go, go, clown. And we've been storming without cops. Seventh, Funny over there. And you're still hanging on? What do you mean? If the cops had come with us... ...you wouldn't have fought back alone. - So why don't they go? - Don't get all cocky. You understand everything. I didn't call the cops and they're not hiding behind the gate. What are you afraid of? Why do you need his confession? Get the money and get out. If the five of us couldn't, what would the three of us do? What he's talking about, Sedoy? That he's got you guys all screwed up. Like children. He needed you to take Kalugin. And then you're a liability. So he came up with the idea of calling the cops by time. And then he was tricking you so you don't eat him. Would you at least tell the men this is a revolution, not a robbery? Only for what? Do you really just want to put him away? - Did you come up with that? - You came up with that. - And I'm cleaning up. - What's he talking about? Sedoy ? Why aren't you talking? Did he just tell the truth? The truth. Oh, you bitch. I knew you were fucking crazy, but to be like this... - It was truth about you, too. - What kind of truth? That you are slaves! You are ready to eat shit just so you don't get touched. And you're gonna stay that way until you're mixed up with that shit! Oh, you're so brave. Only you gon no one beside you... You don't owe anybody. No friends, no family, so you're brave. - Martyr. - You are not humans. People know why they have to live. - And you know what? - I know! - Enlighten me. - Okay, stop horsing around. I'm alone now, that's clear. Get out of here! - Get up. - Fine - Get up now! Oh, come on! The hat. Damn it. You do as you're told. If not, I'll kill him, that's all. No more soulful conversations. I'll blow his head off, and that's it. Fine. Go. Tuman. What you're stubborn about, eh? You think you've got a shitty life? I have to bury a wife in six months! - What are you not happy with? - Everything. I don't fucking understand! So you're gonna put him away, so what? He's got it all figured out! Kids, grandchildren are packed, I've lived my whole life like royalty! So live you too, jerk! Live! Nothing will change if you die. Live. Go. I'll be back in an hour. If I go out alone again, there will be others. Then you decide, you're gonna die alone, or you're gonna take him with you. It's your business. - Are you done? - ?? You're letting them go? Yeah, let them go. This one's got to go to the hospital with his leg. - Get out of here. - Yeah. - Yeah. One-eyed is stubborn? Yes, Dim. Hi. It's me again. You gonna call? Or forgot the number. You know who's behind me. You think they need me to untie my tongue? If you untie it, we'll see. Why you acting like a little boy? I won't live to see the trial. They're gonna put us in grave together. Let it be. I don't care anymore. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Call. - Are you feeling bad? - Will you shut up? You're not my father. Whatever. I can see that you're human. But young, stupid. And I've lived. Oh, yeah? When the order to warzone came, everyone was stumbling around in the corners. Who's got the diarrhea, who's got the crazy one, Well, who's the one who's gonna shoot himself... as long as he don't have to go. I'm the only one, dumbass. Tthat's the way it should be, the homeland calls Three years of blood with dirt. Lice and corpses. Fighting was fun. First surround, then retreat. We retreating, and getting hit in the back. Well, I guess that's the way it should be, command knows better. Came back without an eye. I'm climbing a wall at night. Neighbors frightened. No normal work on horizon There is a long line to be treated In order not to starve to death, i went to the factory. So, tell me, Dad... ...why I have nothing, and you have all? Where's the justice? There is none. Justice. None. There's a real life. Poverty, hunger. Look, everybody has an interest. Understandable interest. Who's for the kids, who's for themselves. Only you for the truth. Where did you see the truth? There in the war? In here? Where everything is buy and sell. Concrete is more expensive than human. You know that as well as I do. So here's the question: if you know what this is all about, why are you trying so much? For people? You hate them as much as I do. Or even more. You don't really need truth. Revenge. Your revenge for the pain, for your torment. For not having a life. Human life. You want everybody to be sick. Like yourself. Call. You know what? I'm not calling anybody. What the fuck do I care who kills me? Cut me off here. I'm coming in You decided? Work it out. Storming. Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Move, move, move. Fool. - Stand down. Stand down! - What? - Stand down. - What do you mean? - Stand down! - Halt! Sedoy! Don't, Sedoy! Hands! Hands! Sedoy! Open fire! Let me go! Stand down. He's sick. - What's in there? - He shot upwards. - Why? - Do I know? Anton. What's up with you? Will you give him a ride? What about you ? I'm gonna take a walk. - Call in task force and we're out of here. - Yes, we do. - Secure the factory. We are waiting for the task force. - On it. On foot, is it?
