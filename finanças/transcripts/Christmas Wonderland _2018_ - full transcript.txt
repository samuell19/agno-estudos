I'm sorry, can you say that again? Yes, the newest Gellar painting will be on display at the gallery opening tonight. Right now we have three interested buyers, but the seller hasn't made a decision yet. Well, it's definitely worth seeing in person. Look, if you wanna make an offer I can put in a good word for you. Thank you. Okay, great, thanks. Okay, how's it going today? Great. The caterer's setting up the tables and all the plaques have been hung by their corresponding paintings, - ready for your approval. - Okay. Okay, the lighting on these oil paintings is too harsh. We gotta move them to the front, put a softer light on them. Good catch. And let's put up a couple decorations, but tonight's really about the exhibit. Next week, we can go all out for the gallery Christmas party. - Great. - Thanks, April. Thanks. I know that look. What's wrong? - The frames on this wall clash. - You're right. Let's try that in a gold frame. I think that would look better. I don't know what I would do without you, Heidi. This whole opening tonight is thanks to you. I'm so glad you acquired that Gellar collection. Just doing my job, boss. Pleasure doing business with you too. Bye. Another successful sale? If all goes well, yeah. Julia's sending me to get a salad. Did you want anything? No, I'm okay, thank you. Will you hand me my vendor binder over there? I have to order another frame ASAP for tonight. Sure. What's this? That's actually my portfolio. You're an artist? Yeah. That's originally why I applied to be Julia's assistant. Thanks. I just wanted to get my foot in the door, have my work be seen. Do you mind if I take a look? Sure. Oh, my goodness. You're really good. Has Julia seen these? Briefly, yeah, when I first started. - I love that one. - That's awesome. She was more impressed with my assistant skills, so painting, I put on the back burner. I asked her the other day if she wanted to take another look, and she said, "Soon," but I think she was just being nice. You should keep at it. Yeah, I want to. I just have to find the time. This is Heidi. Hi, Mr. Collins. We loved your new prints. When can you come in? So I know this last unit was pretty difficult, and a lot of you guys are having trouble concentrating with Christmas break coming around the corner, but... I know you guys can do better, which is why, on Friday, I'm gonna let you guys retake it. All right? Sound good? Have a good one, guys. I'll see ya soon. Hey, Tom. Hey, can you hang back for a sec? Is everything okay? You usually do a lot better than that on the test. Yeah, just a lot of details to memorize. Nothing's distracting you? No. Good, good, 'cause as your hockey coach, I get to see firsthand how well you do when you really dedicate yourself to something. I will study more. Okay, well, let me know if you need any help, all right? Thanks, Mr. Shepherd. Have a good one, Tom. Matt, please let Erica know that I still have her slow cooker. I didn't forget. I will get it back to her this weekend. Do you have a second? Yeah, yeah. I need to ask a favor. Oh, no. That's the tone of voice you use when you want something as a vice principal and not my best friend. What are you talking about? This is my normal voice. All right, fine. It's a bit of a good news, bad news situation. Yeah? Good news, Nancy had her baby a few weeks early. - That's wonderful. - It is. And the bad news is? She was in charge of the Snowball Dance, and I need somebody to take over planning it. Are you really asking me to take over the Christmas dance? Everybody else is busy. Hockey doesn't start till next year, I figure who better to plan the Snowball Dance than the guy who was once crowned the Snowball King. That was forever ago. Why don't you just do it? I have two-year-old twins, man. You think I have any free time? What makes you think I know anything about running a Christmas dance? Nancy left me all her plans, all right? All you gotta do is finish setting up the gym, confirm with the deejay, that sort of thing. It's nothing major. Look, you'd be doing me, the students, and most importantly, Christmas itself a huge favor. Can I talk to my best friend for a second - and not my vice principal? - Shoot. You're not gonna believe what my boss just asked me to do. Look, I'll get you a list of PTA parents you can ask to volunteer if you need a hand. What do you say? - Fine. - You're the best! Thank you. I gotta get to a meeting. I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Chris! You're welcome. - Hi. Thank you for coming. - Hey. Heidi, I want you to meet Mr. Gellar. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. I'm a huge admirer of your work. Thank you. This opening is incredible. Julia here says that it's all thanks to you. Oh, well, I had a lot of help. Heidi here is my right-hand woman at the gallery. She started off as my assistant, but within just a couple of months, I saw her raw talent for art dealing. She has a good eye for what sells. That's because Heidi is also a painter. - A really good one. - Is that so? Yes, I used to paint, and now I do this. Well, you've chosen the right path. The gallery is wonderful. You should see what she has in store for the gallery Christmas party coming up. - You will be there, won't you? - Without a doubt. - Great. - Yeah. Is that Nick Jones by chance? Yes, it is. You should absolutely meet him. - Come, I'll introduce you. - Excuse us. Hope it's okay that I said you're a painter. Yeah, of course. I'm sure most people here have similar aspirations. Do you miss it? Yes, very much. But this is a good job, and I'm lucky to have it. Hey, dinner's almost ready. No snacking. Got an email from Mr. Shepherd today. He says he needs volunteers for the Snowball Dance. What, like chaperone? No, I wouldn't do that to you. Just to help decorate and set it all up. - Cool. - So you're going, right? Yeah, probably, with like a group of friends. Mr. Shepherd also mentioned you didn't do so great on your history test. Hey, dishes by hand tonight. The dishwasher's broken. - So the test. - It was super hard, and most of the people in the class didn't do well. Okay, well, I'm glad he's offering a makeup. This week I'm thinking less hockey time, more study time. Hey, Katie, how's pageant rehearsal going? Terrible. Why do I feel like you're being overly dramatic? It is. You've been hoping for this solo all year, and now you're not into it? It's a horrid song. There are a lot of lyrics to remember. You're gonna do great. Great news. Close on the house for the Scoffers? Oh, no, better. Guess which husband-and-wife realtor duo just got asked to be the keynote speakers at the National Realtor Convention? Wait, what? Us? - That's amazing. - I know! Maybe we can all make a trip out of it next year. No, no, it's for this year's convention. The speaker they had dropped out last minute. We leave tomorrow. Sorry. - April, I have to take this. - Okay, no worries. - Hey, Megan. - Enjoying your evening? Megan, you know I love those kids more than anything, but now is really not a good time. It's only for two nights. I know, but I have three sales in the works, and I'm really busy trying to get ready for this gallery Christmas party. Every agent, art dealer, and artist in Manhattan is gonna be there. I don't get how you moving to New York to be a painter turned into you being a fancy party planner. Well, plans change. So can they change this time and help me and John out? Can't Mom and Dad come back early? No, they don't dock from their Italian cruise till the end of the week. That's right. Hey, Mom, I can take care of Katie. Nice try, but I'm not leaving my 15-year-old son alone for two nights. - I babysit all the time. - For a couple of hours. - Overnight is different. - Okay. Heidi, this is a huge opportunity for John and me. I wouldn't be asking if I didn't really need this. Okay, let me see what I can do. Thank you, thank you. You're the best sister in the world. - I know. - I love you. I love you too. Bye. Somebody just made an offer on four of the Gellar still lifes. That's great. - Julia, do you have a second? - Yeah. My sister and my brother-in-law, they have to leave town unexpectedly and they need someone to watch my niece and nephew. I was wondering if I could take a couple days and help them out. You can't be serious. We have the Christmas party to get ready for. You know how important that is. I know, but I can continue to do the prep while I'm gone. Well, what about our clients? You have to follow up on the Anderson sales, and the Clover buyer. I know, but I can do it all remotely. Listen, she would not ask if it wasn't really important. Okay, just promise me you'll be back in time for the Christmas party. I promise. Where are you from again? Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania. Sounds cozy. Thanks. - Aunt Heidi! - Hi, Katie! Wait a minute. Who's this tall guy wearing my nephew's clothes? Hi. So yeah, Mom said it was totally fine if I threw a party while you were here, so... - Oh, did she? - Mm-hmm. - Have you met your Mom? - Well, it was worth a try. Hi. We have to head to the airport, so I just wanted to give you a quick rundown of everything. Okay, sure. So you have to make sure Katie is at drop-off by 7:45 a.m. Tom has a makeup history test on Friday, so he needs to be studying for that. The fridge is fully stocked. I left out recipes for all the meals. Here's a credit card in case of emergency... - I will hold onto that for you. - No, you won't. Also, Katie has a solo in her school Christmas pageant, so she needs to be practicing for that. Okay, there's emergency numbers on the fridge... Megan, relax. Breathe, okay? I got it. I can take care of two kids for two days. Megan, honey, we gotta get going. - Okay, I love you, bye. - Bye, love you. Heidi, thanks again. You're a lifesaver. Yeah, you got it. Oh, and I volunteered to help on the Snowball Dance committee, so you need to meet at the high school gym tonight at 8:00 p.m. - Megan... - Don't be late. That wasn't part of the plan. Tom, no teasing your sister! So do you think we should tell her that committee's being run by Chris Shepherd? I didn't want her to get upset. They're both adults. Might do them both good to see each other again. Ready? Ready. I feel like it's been forever. What do you mean? You guys came to the city for Easter. No, I mean since you've been here. No, I was here for Christmas last year. No, you weren't. You had to work. Yeah, that's right. Year before, then. I'd come home more often if I could. I hope you know that. You still have that up. Of course. It's my favorite. My friends come over, and they ask about it. I tell them my super artsy aunt painted it. You should make one for Katie. Yeah, it's on my to-do list, for sure. If I ever have time, I definitely will. Hey, Katie, do you want any more pizza! She's probably got her headphones on. Did you know that pizza actually has all the food groups? Your mom would be very proud of me. Does that mean we get to eat it tomorrow too? Yeah. It is 8:00. Okay, great. Shouldn't you be at the Snowball Dance committee thing? Yeah. How does your mom make dinner, go to PTA meetings, and run a realty company all at the same time? Are you gonna be okay for a few hours? Yeah. We're just throwing a party while you're gone. Very funny. Call me if you need me. All right, bye. Hi. Hey, sorry, did I miss the meeting? No, you're actually the first one to show up. - Heidi? - Chris? What are you doing here? I'm watching the kids for Megan. She said she volunteered for... What are you doing here? I work here? That's right. Yeah, Tom mentioned that he had you for history. And hockey. You're the hockey coach too. - I know that look. - What look? The "Chris is a teacher and hockey coach at our old high school" look. Well, clearly you're projecting 'cause in no way am I giving that look. I know you better than you think. Well, we were together a long time ago. So you're planning the Snowball. Yeah, yeah, not by choice. Matt kinda just insisted. I still can't believe that Matt Sampson is vice principal. - Hey, how's Erica? - She's good. She has her hands full with the twins and the store. Who would've thought that all those years ago that those two would be married with twins? And that a high school relationship would work out. So, how many people are you expecting? Pretty sure you're looking at it. Yeah. Okay, what can I do? Are you serious? You actually wanna help? Yeah. I work for an art gallery in New York. 90% of what I do there is just helping my boss plan parties. And plus I told Megan that I would help her out. Wait, you don't paint? Well, I'm in that world, but no. I found more success buying and selling art at the gallery. - What? - Nothing, I just... I thought you went to New York so you could become an artist. Well, sometimes things don't work out the way you hope. So, yeah, I was going through everything that they left. It's not great. Ooh, yikes. I was gonna lay it all out and see what we had to work with. I think some decorations are actually from our Snowball, maybe a couple decades before that. Probably just throw that one out, actually. No, I can fix it. Okay, what is that look for? I'm just surprised... that you actually want to put the work into something, instead of buy something new, move on. Why do I suddenly feel like you're not talking about the snowflake? What else would I be talking about? Nothing. You know what? I'm sure you'd rather spend time with your niece and nephew. I got this. Fine by me. This wasn't exactly on my list of things I wanted to do tonight. Well, be my guest. Okay. Hey, come on, guys, we're already behind schedule. Hey, I made breakfast. Well, I set out breakfast. Mom usually makes us eggs. And bacon. And sometimes pancakes. And Dad sometimes makes us smoothies. This looks great too. Good, okay. You know what? I gotta take this. Heidi, where did you put the Edison sales slips? It's all digital now, so it's in our "G" folder under "transactions". Thank goodness. I thought they were gone. Okay, when you get a chance, can you please email the Parks Gallery? They wanna know if we're interested in participating in the Art Walk. I told them you would know our schedule better than I would. Well, April has access to the calendar. I would just feel better if you would take care of it. Of course, no problem. And did Robert text you about the catering for the party? Yes. I'm gonna respond right now. Okay, well, I guess that's it. Okay, well, let me know if you need anything else. I will. Great, bye. Robert. Okay, ready? Here, put this on. That sounds good. Oh, shoot, almost forgot. Let's go. Okay. Hey, remember, no hockey tonight 'cause you have to study for that test. But some guys are going to the rink to practice for tryouts. I know. It's not me. It's your mom. Sorry. All right, fine. Bye! Love you! Love you too. Hey. Hey, who's that girl Tom just said hi to? I don't know. Usually Mom drops me off first. You get dropped off first? Yeah, otherwise I'm late. Shoot. - Aunt Heidi! - Right, sorry. Chris! How'd the meeting go? One person showed up. Wanna know who that one person was? - Santa? - Heidi Nelson. She's out here watching her niece and nephew for a few days. - Well, how'd it go? - Not great. - Did you talk to her? - Yeah, yeah, about the dance. Okay, so not about the fact that she broke your heart, and you've never been the same since. Seeing how that's not the case, no, it did not come up. Good. That's good. Just make sure the florist is there by 4:00, so she has time to set up. Okay, thanks, Robert. Bye. Heidi? - Erica, hey! - Hi! I didn't know you were in town. Yeah, I'm watching Tom and Katie, I'm only here till tomorrow, otherwise I would've called you. I get it. Taking care of kids is time consuming. Hey, guys. I've seen pictures of you on Integra, but you're much cuter in person. Michael, James, this is Mommy's friend, Heidi. - Can you say hi? - They're so cute. - How are Tom and Katie? - They're good. Growing up too fast. Is Tom going to the Snowball? I don't know. We haven't talked about it. I hope so. Well, Matt has us down to chaperone. He tried to make it sound like it would be this fun romantic night out, and I told him he had to just say the words, we'll get a babysitter, and I was there. Megan signed up to help plan the dance, so I went in her place last night. Nobody really showed up. It was just me and Chris Shepherd. Yeah. How was that? He had it mostly under control, so I didn't really do much. No, I mean, how was it seeing him again? I know it's been awhile. Yeah, it was fine. - It was weird. - Good weird? He didn't really seem very happy to see me. I'm sure he's just overwhelmed with the dance stuff. I know Matt sort of sprung it on him last minute. - I'm glad he had you to help. - Yeah, kind of. Did you know he had a book published last year? Chris has a book? Yeah, something about Mark Twain. Good for him. - Your usual. - Thank you so much. - I gotta go. - Yeah, it was great to see you. It was so great to see you. - Okay, bye, guys. - Bye. Make sure to check the modified finals schedule. We're looking forward to seeing you at the Snowball. You can still get tickets at the student store. Have a great day. Hey, shouldn't somebody be spotting you? I like to live life on the edge. Were you... What are you doing here? I just felt bad about the way we ended things last night. And Megan signed up to help out with this, and I should fill in and help out in her place. It's really okay. Actually, I had some ideas for some decorations. Do you remember our Snowball? We had those icicles that came down from the ceiling? Icicles aren't exactly the first things that come to mind when I think about that night, no. Well, I just thought it'd be a cool effect to have. I can help you make some if you want. You don't have to. I'm sure you have a lot going on. What? Nothing. I thought I felt a drip on my face. Well, actually, I was thinking with this Styrofoam, with a little paint and a little shading, I think it'll look great. - Ooh. - Hey, careful, careful! There you go. It's coming down now. Yeah, it's just water. The bright side is we might have real icicles for decorations. Yeah, so I guess after they left, the roof sprung a major leak. If they can't fix the roof in time, is the Snowball canceled? I don't know. I hope not. I'm sure Vice Principal Sampson will figure something out. Did you use the dishwasher? Yes. It's, broken. You don't say. Hey, Tom, are these all the towels you have? There might be some in the closet under the stairs. Okay. Right there. Hey, what's my old easel doing in here? I don't know. Grandma and Grandpa brought over a bunch of stuff. Yeah. These are my old yearbooks. You should paint something. Yeah, maybe later. The kitchen floor's still wet. I don't wanna warp the floors. Hey. That doesn't look like studying. It is, just not history class studying. Do you want some help? Are you good at history? No. Actually, Mr. Shepherd is the one that helped me get through all my history classes - in high school. - Yeah, that's right. Mom told me you guys used to date. We did. You guys were so popular. Weren't you guys Snowball King and Queen? Yeah. That means I'm actual royalty, so you have to listen to me, and you have to study. I know. Mr. Shepherd's the best. Mom said if I get straight A's this semester I can get my driver's permit. Cool. What's the problem? I don't know. There's a girl. How'd you know? Because I fell victim to those symptoms too. You can't focus, you can't concentrate on anything. You think about them all the time. Yeah, that sums it up. Well, why don't you ask her to the Snowball Dance? No. No, she'd say no. And I think she's into this other guy named Ryan. He's way too popular. So? How can you be sure unless you try? Okay, don't stay up too late. I won't. And do your homework. All right. Cool. "Realtor husband-and-wife dazzle at convention". Howdy. Hope you folks aren't planning on flying anywhere today. Why do you say that? Airport-wide computer outage. All flights are grounded. What do you mean, you're not coming home today? I'm supposed to be back at work. My boss is gonna freak out. I'm really sorry. All flights are grounded. They have no idea when things will be up and running again. Okay, what are you gonna do? Well, we don't wanna risk the wait, so we're just gonna keep the rental car and try and fly out of Atlanta. - Okay. - Wait. So will you be home in time for the pageant? Of course. Hopefully we'll be back tomorrow. Sweet. More time with Aunt Heidi. I miss you too, Tom. And, Heidi, since I won't be back in time, you have to bake some cookies to take to the Christmas cookie sale at Katie's school today. Meg, you know I don't bake. We have all the ingredients. I'll text you an easy recipe. It'll be great. Tom and Katie can help. Okay. How many ounces in a cup? I don't know. Just look it up. - I... - Okay, just guesstimate then. Katie, how are those dry ingredients coming? What do you mean by dry? Okay, well, it all goes in the oven, right? So how hard can it be? Okay. That's the first batch. That does not look like snowmen. Well, that's 'cause we haven't frosted it yet. Okay, that grocery store down the street, it has a bakery, right? Thank you. Look! The cookies we brought are almost all gone. Yeah, I know. I just feel bad we wasted all your mom's ingredients. - I'll still eat those. - Really? Yeah, they're still sugar, flour, and frosting. That's true. Hey, I think that's your cue. Okay. These aren't doing so hot. Those are gross. Can I skip school today? Is this about your mom? You know they're gonna be back soon, and I'm gonna stay until they get here. That's not it. Okay, then what's wrong? I don't wanna go to pageant rehearsal today. You know you're a great singer, Katie. Thanks. Is there something specifically about the solo that you're worried about? No, never mind. I should go. She'll be okay. I hope so. If your mom was here, she'd know what to say. - See you after school. - Bye. Have a good day. We just pull up the floor and pull out the damaged ceiling tiles, and we're good. Let's get this stuff out of the way, so we can bring in the man-lift, okay? - This is going in the Dumpster? - Let's get it moving. Heidi, I heard you were in town. Hey, Matty Sampson. It's been too long. I thought you were leaving town today. Yeah, actually, Megan and John got stuck, so I'm here for a little bit longer. So what's the verdict? There's no way it's gonna be repaired in time for the dance. And most of the decorations have been destroyed. So it's a good thing that I have the best Snowball planning-team ever. Surely you guys can figure out a new location and find some new decorations as quickly as possible, right? We may actually have to just cancel. Yeah. The Snowball? Guys, come on. You know how special this dance is. No way we can cancel. You'll think of something. I gotta get back to it. Heidi, it was lovely to see you. You look the exact same. So do you. I'm sure I do. I think it might be me. I think I'm jinxed because after this happened, I went home, and the dishwasher was broken, and the whole kitchen was flooded. So this is all your fault? Yeah. Are we gonna be able to find another location for the dance? I don't know. I do have to get to class, though, but I have a free period later. If you wanna maybe meet up at Frank's, let's say 2:00, brainstorm some new locations... Frank's. Okay, sure. Okay, I will see you then. Yeah. Bye. Just make sure you include the account number on the invoice. There's so much to get done before the party. I can't believe you're not gonna be back today. I know, but you're doing a great job. Thank you so much for filling in. I'll be back as soon as I can. Julia just got back. Is that Heidi? Heidi, where were we meant to display the Kensington's collection? Over by the far wall, next to the newer watercolors. What time are you coming in today? Actually, that's kind of why I'm calling. My sister and brother-in-law, they got stuck. It's kind of up in the air when they're gonna be back. Heidi, you said it was only gonna be for two days. I need you here. Do you know how much has to get done - before the Christmas party? - Yes, of course. I'm gonna do as much as I can from here, and April can fill in until I'm back. Okay, but you will be back in time for the party, correct? Yes, of course. I'll definitely be there. Good, because you know how much I depend on you at these things. I know. Okay, well, I guess I'll see you then. Okay, bye. So there's no way we can reserve the space? I know it's short notice and all. I understand. No, I understand. Thank you very much. All right, bye-bye. So there's nothing available. That's the fifth place we've tried. There has to be a place we're not thinking of. What? Nothing, just why don't you pour the coffee in there and drink that? Fine. I'm not very good at adulting, all right? I wouldn't say that. I think you're doing pretty well for yourself. Well, I'm no big-city art dealer. I looked up your art gallery. It's actually... It's pretty impressive. Trust me, what I do there isn't that impressive. Then why'd you quit painting? Job got in the way. Money was good. It's a lot easier judging other people's work than having people judge mine. I miss it though. Then you should paint. You always were the most talented person I ever met. You know, I found my easel at Megan's. It's like seeing an old friend. It's kind of like this. Yeah, except the easel didn't hate me. I can never hate you, Heidi. You know, why don't you paint something for the Snowball, huh? Why don't we find a venue first? Right. Location would be good. One other place I can think of is that new country club, but I think their rental fee would be out of our budget. What about that hotel on Dunbar? Is that still there? It's kind of a drive, but it might be something. You really wanna do our school dance at a stale hotel conference there? Do you have a better idea? I do not. I will look them up. Call 'em. Hey, hello. How's it going? I'm a teacher over at Lincoln High School, and we're looking for a last-minute location for our school dance on the 23rd. No, yeah, that would work. Can we maybe come by and see the space? I don't know. Maybe 20 minutes? - Sure. - Thank you. Stale hotel it is. Hey, why didn't you tell me you had a history book published? Never came up. It's not like you call every time you're in town. Well, I'm not in town very often. When I am, it's only for a couple days. But for what it's worth, I'm really impressed. Thank you. It's a far cry from the jock you knew in high school who was holding you back. Holding me back? I never thought that. Didn't you? You had all these big plans, and I wasn't part of them. - That's why we broke up. - No, we broke up because you went off to college to play hockey, and I wanted to be an artist in New York, and it just didn't make sense to stay together. We could have tried though. Either way, it worked out. My dreams of becoming a professional hockey player went out the window when I hurt my knee, and I found everything I wanted in Pleasant Valley. You did the same in New York. I should've called when you hurt your knee, but we hadn't spoken since we broke up and... I'm sorry. That must've been really hard. It was. But being home helped. And I was planning on moving back to Pleasant Valley anyways. It just happened a lot sooner than I thought it would. Yeah, looks like both of our dreams didn't really work out the way we thought they would. But yours still could. But please never stop painting, Heidi. That's the reason I fell in love with you. - Really? - Yup. It was freshman year art class. You painted that beautiful picture of... Main Street. I saw that, and I just got inspired. You know, you did that. You made something from nothing. Obviously that's not the only reason I fell in love with you. You're smart, you're funny, you're like the prettiest girl I've ever seen. - Oh, shoot. - What? It's this gauge. It says it's full when it's not. That's the problem with these old cars. - Pull over. - All right. - You have a signal? - No. Wait a minute. Hey, do you realize where we are? Yeah, not near a gas station. No, that's Glenn Farms. That's where we had our first date. - We fed the baby goats. - Yeah. Glenn sold the place a couple of years ago. Nice old couple bought it and renovated it. It's a B&B now. - Cool. - Yeah. Let's go use their phone. Hello! Hello. Can I help ya? I'm Heidi. This is Chris. Our car ran out of gas. We were just curious if we could borrow your phone. I'll do you one better. I got some gasoline in the barn. It's enough to get you back into town. That would be great. Thank you. Oh, wow. This place is beautiful. I don't remember it looking this good. Well, my wife and I bought it a while back, and we converted the house up the road into a B&B, and now I'm working to renovate this place into an event space. You rent the barn for events? Well, that's the goal. Still haven't finished renovating it yet. No, it's perfect. Well, thank you. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I think I am. Do you have any availability on Monday? Yeah, but like I said, the place is not ready for guests yet. You wanna rent it this spring? Actually, we need it for a high school Christmas dance. We're in desperate need of a new location. Well... I don't think I can have the barn ready that fast. We don't care. We can do everything needed, and it's good as-is. Well, I'll give you... I'll give it to you half-off the going rate 'cause it isn't finished. That is so nice of you. Thank you. Thank you. This is gonna be great. - The place was amazing. - Yeah. The kids are gonna love it. How sweet is Roy? You know what I was thinking? Maybe we could rent some horses and some sleighs for the outside. I'm not quite sure that's in our budget, Heidi. Well, the good news is that farm's only a few miles outside of town, and all we have to do is decorate the barn since the rest of that place screams Christmas. It was like stepping into a dream. - Didn't you feel that way? - I did. And I already have the perfect theme. All right, lay it on me. "Christmas Wonderland". Hey, that's perfect. Hey, did you see that wood panel inside the barn? I was thinking we could use it to decorate. You could paint a mural, and we can hang it above the stairs. I'm sure Roy has a better use for it. We could ask. It looked like it was in a scrap pile to me. I was thinking something "Wonderland Snowball" themed. You know, a personal touch from a past snow queen. I'll think about it. Hey, these stocking are really cool. That school's really upped their crafts. You're kinda quiet tonight. How did rehearsal go? Fine, I guess. You wanna talk about it? I'm gonna forget all those words in front of all those people. What do you mean? You've been rehearsing all week. But it's a hard song. There's a lot to memorize. You know, I used to get really nervous every time I showed my paintings to people. So what did you do? Well, I guess I just realized that... I really liked them, and I was really proud of them, and that's kind of all that mattered. Hey, would it help if we went over it together? Yes. Maybe. Okay. Hey, you didn't need to call Mr. Shepherd over. I'm studying. I didn't call Mr. Shepherd! - Hey. Chris. - Hey. - What are you doing here? - I hope I'm not interrupting. I remembered that you mentioned the dishwasher was broken, and my dad used to be a plumber, so... I thought I'd come take a look for you. Actually, that would be great. Thanks. Come on in. - You sure? - Yeah. Something smells good. Yeah, it's takeout Thai food. They got tired of pizza. - Hey, Mr. Shepherd. - Hey, Tom, how are you? I'm just studying for the makeup tomorrow. - I like seeing that. - Yeah. When was the Missouri Compromise? We are not cheating. 1822? Close. 1820. That is what I meant. Dishwasher? Yeah, fix away. I don't really know what's wrong with it. Katie and I are gonna go rehearse her solo in the Christmas pageant. Let me guess, "Herald Angel?" Yeah, and I'm not good at it. Please, I doubt that. You know, I had the same exact solo when I was in 4th grade? - I remember that. - Do you? They still making you do all the verses? - Yup! - That is a tough one. Yeah, but Aunt Heidi was going to go over the words with me. Was she? Yeah. I think that is a great idea. Let's go sing. Have fun. All right, who was James Monroe's Vice President? Tompkins. - That's right. - I remember that one because the first three letters are my name. Smart. Now if only all the other vice presidents had the name "Tom," you would be unbeatable. All right. I think we're... I think we're all fixed. Okay, great. - Thank you. - Yeah. How am I supposed to remember, "All ye nations, rise. Join the triumph of the skies with angelic host proclaim"? It makes no sense to me. It's okay. It doesn't have to make sense. Just find a rhythm and a flow, and I promise you all those words are gonna come so much easier. I have an idea. Can I connect to your Bluetooth real quick? Sure. Katie, so this is the same exact song. It's a little more upbeat, but something you can dance to. I promise you're gonna remember every single one of those words. Come on, come on, come on, come on! - Tom, get over here, come on. - Tom, come on! Get over here! Come on, dance with me! Hey, thank you. Yeah, of course. Actually, I had a lot of fun. Yeah, me too. Hey, you still have some moves. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You have some pretty cool kids in there. Yeah. That's all my sister's doing. Good genes. Yeah, I guess. You're really good with them. Thanks. These last few days have actually been really great, despite flooding the kitchen. So should we decorate our Wonderland tomorrow? Yeah, sure. I have some stuff in the morning, but I could do the afternoon. Perfect. All right, well, I guess I will see you then? - Yeah, okay. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. What are you looking for? This picture of me and Chris. I mean, Mr. Shepherd. You guys were boyfriend and girlfriend, weren't you? Yeah, we were. I like him a lot. Yeah, he's a good guy. There it is. It looks like you're in a fairy tale. Yeah, it does. Okay, I think it's time for bed. - Come on, let's go. - I am, I am. Hi. Aunt Heidi, you keep outdoing yourself. Four different kinds of cereal. Yeah, well, I wanted you to have the pick of the best for your big test today. Hey, it's your mom. Hey, good morning. Tom, you ready for your test? I think so. Hey, what's your status? John's grabbing us some lunch. Unfortunately, there was bad weather in Atlanta, so we decided our best bet was just to keep driving. It should only take another day or so. Hey, Megan, my boss really needs me back as soon as possible. Heidi, we're doing everything we can. I am so sorry for this. I know you are. It's okay. I'm just gonna let Julia know what's going on. So how are things there? Good. Mr. Shepherd came over last night and helped us fix the dishwasher. - Oh, did he now? - Yeah, not like that. It wasn't like that. He was just being nice. I'm sure. I sure miss you guys so much. We miss you too. How's Aunt Heidi's cooking? It is delicious. - He's lying, he's lying. - Delicious, delicious! I made eggs. Bye! See you later! Really? Okay, what you got going on today? We're doing a run-through of all the songs. Would you like to come watch? It would make me less nervous. Yeah, of course. I'd love to be there. Well, maybe I should come too. No, you're just trying to get out of that test. Okay, I'm gonna drop him off, and I'll be right back. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. - Have a good day. Good luck. Bye! Good, good, Katie. That's perfect. Next time, let's do it with a little less dancing, yeah? Great, everyone! So that's it for today. We'll see you all tomorrow. What did you think? Hey, you were so great. - And you knew all the words. - I did. I just thought of the song Chris played for us. Yeah, I know. I could tell. I'm really proud of you. Thanks for watching. Thanks for letting me watch. - See ya later. - Okay, I'll see ya later. Forgot my lunchbox. Wanna see my drawing? Yeah. Which one's yours? That one. I really like all the colors. Are you the art teacher today? No... Actually, I used to be a student here. I just wanted to come back and look at my old art room. Art's my favorite class. It was mine too. I hope I do it forever. I hope you do too. I gotta go to lunch now. Bye! Bye. Whoa! Eyes on your own tests! - Good news. - Okay. The school board approved the Wonderland Acres location. That's great. And they have increased the decoration budget because they loved the idea that much. That is even better. All right, so after school, you'll get on it, yeah? I will. I'm picking Heidi up this afternoon. I have a double free period, so... What? Nothing. I mean, you've just, you've been really happy the last few days. Yeah. Christmas is almost here. I love Christmas. You should tell her how you feel. I should? And how is that? That you're in love with her and have been since high school. You're so ridiculous, Matt, you know that? In all seriousness though, this might be your second chance. She lives in New York. We want different things. It's just... It's not gonna work. I tried. Have fun decorating. By the way, word of advice: Glitter gets everywhere. Be careful. I will. - Careful. - All right. All of the Christmas decorations are right over here. - Erica, this place is so cute. - Thank you. You should check out the paint section. I got some of the best brushes out there. Maybe you and Erica should just pick this stuff out. I don't really have quite the eye for it. Come on. Just pick out anything that looks winter-wonderlandy. That narrows it down. It's fun seeing you both back together. I mean, just back here in town. The both of you in the same space, not back together-together. Maybe we should get this going. - We don't have much time. - Of course. Holler if you need me. I gotta set up a craft table for the kids' ornament decorating this afternoon. - I'm gonna look over here. - Okay. Think we should get a little bit more glitter. No, no, I think we're pretty good on the glitter. Ooh! What do you think about this? For my Dance chaperone outfit, huh? - It's great. - Thank you. I don't know if it really brings out your eyes though. I was afraid of that. Get it anyway. Okay. - Hey, these are great. - Great, right? We should get a couple more of those. - It was a good find. - Yeah. You need more supplies. Look, I stand by what I said. A mural is the perfect addition for the Snowball. - I don't know. - Come on. Finding everything? Yeah. Oh, cute. Are those all your ornament decorations? Feel free to make one. Kids won't be here for another hour or so. Actually, we should probably get going. I think we could make a quick one, yeah. Okay, we will make a quick one. I have to grab more tinsel from the back, but go crazy. Okay. Ooh, tiny little chairs. Okay... You can have that one. - Okay. - I'm gonna do gold. Go for the gold. Those will look good. - Okay. - Done? - That's really good. - Thank you. You must be an artist. Let me see yours. Thank you. Yeah. Lovely. Very nice. Thank you. That is very generous of you. A lot of effort went into that, yeah. We should probably get going though. Yeah, you're right. Take it. Wait for Erica to come back. Turn. - What? - Turn your head. You have something in your hair there. Put that on there. Thank you. Want me to ring you up? That would be great, Erica, thank you. Thank you, Erica. Hey, what do you think if we hang these lights over there? I think it's a great idea. Hey, brought you each a hot chocolate. Aw, thanks, Roy. That's really sweet. That's all right. I'm just glad to see this barn come alive. Just wait till we add the layer of glitter. Layer? I thought we said subtle dash? Whatever you both want. That's what I built this place for... celebration! Then do you mind if we use the wood panel, so Heidi can paint a mural? We can hang it above the staircase. A mural? Yeah, she's a great painter. I promise you it'll be top-notch. Hey, Chris, that's fine. You're a painter? Yes. Actually, I just painted something of Wonderland Acres. Here. You're quite an artist. Yeah, you can use whatever you need. What you gonna paint? You know, I haven't worked that out yet. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it. I'll be back. I can't wait either. - Did you get it untangled? - Yeah. That looks pretty good, right? Yeah, it looks good. Okay. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm sorry. For what? For ending things so soon. I just thought it was the right thing to do. I figured we'd never end up in the same place, so it was better to end it early than to drag it out and... and hurt more. You did what you thought was best. I get it. Okay, let's work on this now. All right. I was thinking we could just sprinkle it all over the room so the whole place kind of sparkles. It seems like a lot. It might get everywhere. The worst thing would be standing in front of my class, having a student point at my hair, saying "I saw glitter in it," like four months from now. Really? So that would be like the worst thing in the world for you? Yeah, pretty much. Did that really just happen? Yeah, I think it did. Good luck getting all that out. Hey. What happened to you? You know, just making this year's Snowball Dance one they will remember forever. You look like a unicorn sneezed on you. Thank you. Hey, how'd your test go? Good. I went back to check if Mr. Shepherd had graded them yet, but he wasn't there. That's 'cause he was with me. We were decorating for the dance. I should've known. What? You don't wanna be seen with your glitter-covered aunt? That and I heard through a couple of people that Ryan did ask Monica to the dance. I'm sorry. It's okay. Wasn't meant to be. Hey. You never know what the future holds. Where's the other half of your decorating team? I'm flying solo at the moment. Dance is in three days, so I'm trying to get as much done as possible. - Yeah, it looks good. - Thanks. I just wish my wife could have been here to see this place all decorated like this. I didn't realize she wasn't here. No, she passed away a few years back. This whole thing was her idea. I just kept going with the renovations for her. I'm sorry. Well, so am I. It's rare when you find somebody who fits your soul like a good pair of gloves. And that's what we were, the perfect fit. But look at me, I'm distracting you from your work. No, that's okay. You've done a lot with this glitter. Do you think it's too much? No, no, no, it's marvelous, yeah. Thanks. I don't think anyone's ever bought this much paint at one time. Really? I don't know. I guess I just feel inspired for the first time in a long time, like I've... woken up or something. Maybe you just finally have the time now. No, I mean, I'm really busy watching Megan's kids, and I'm supposed to be back at work in New York right now, but here I am. Then maybe it's Pleasant Valley. What do you mean? This is where you fell in love with painting. Perhaps you're discovering it all over again. Maybe. I hadn't thought of that. This should help. The first Snowball Dance photographed was in the early '20s. And then these are some of the older yearbooks and newspapers. This is perfect. Thank you. No worries. So you're gonna tell me what this is all for now? No. You'll find out soon enough. Whatever it is, I appreciate all you're doing to help with the Snowball. - It's actually been really fun. - Good. I'm glad you and Chris are getting along. Yeah, we make a good team. You guys were always great together. I should get to the school board meeting. If you need anything else, let me know. Okay, great, thank you. I put another book in that stack that you should check out. You look like you've been here a while. Yeah, all night. Both the kids had sleepovers to celebrate the start of Christmas break. Painting the mural? - Yeah, you wanna come see? - Yeah, I'd love to. But you have to close your eyes. - Seriously? - Yes, for the full effect. Come on. All right. You guiding me? I can't see. Yeah, I'm guiding you. - Can I open now? - No, not yet. Okay, now you can look. That's incredible. I call it Snowball Dance of Christmas Past. It's a snapshot of every Snowball since it started. Matt gave me some yearbooks, so I could get the feel of how everybody dressed and looked. Is that us? Yeah. That's the year we were crowned Snow King and Queen. I love it, Heidi. Everyone is gonna love it. Hey, isn't this... Our song? Acoustics sound pretty good in here. There's only one way to find out. - Pretty good. - Thank you, thank you. I read your book. Really? Well, I flipped through it. We all know history isn't my strong suit. Very true. I'm thinking of writing another one. Pretty soon I'll get to teach my book in my class. Yeah. It's really great that you found your calling. Must have been hard when you couldn't play hockey anymore. It was, but then I found a new dream. Maybe that's what I should do. Or you could just get reacquainted with your original one. I mean, that mural is... it's amazing, Heidi. It's 'cause of this town. The past. Us. It's my boss. She's been trying to reach me all day. - I'm sorry. - Okay. Heidi? Hey, is everything okay? My phone has been blowing up all day. Because of the party? No. That painting you sent April, she put it up on our gallery's art space page. All of our clients have been asking about it. I didn't realize she posted it. It's a really great painting. In fact, some people have even mentioned that they wanna see more of your stuff. - Really? - Yes. Look, I've been thinking. I know I haven't been very supportive of your art in the past, but I want that to change. Why don't you bring your painting to the Christmas party? I want to put it on display. You won't just be my right-hand woman. You'll be a contributing artist, okay? Okay. I don't know what to say. Well, say that you're gonna be there no matter what. None of this stuck in your hometown nonsense. Yes, I will absolutely be there. Great. We'll talk later. Good news? Yeah. Actually, my boss loved the painting of Wonderland Acres. - That's great. - Yeah. She's just worried that I won't be back in time for the gallery Christmas party. - And when's the party? - Monday. So you can't go the Snowball? See all of our hard work pay off? Yeah, I know. It's just that... my job really depends on this party. Now it feels like I have even more reason to get back there. So when do you leave? As soon as Megan and John get back. Otherwise, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'll have to find somebody to watch the kids. They'll be back, or I'll watch the kids. Look, some stuff is meant to be, and your art should be seen by everyone. Thanks. Thank you for always believing in me. I'm gonna get going. I got a bunch of tests to grade. Okay. That was nice of you to give Erica the night off. She made it very clear that I had to take the twins somewhere and let her catch up on her Christmas shopping. Listen, we're gonna go over to Maple Street, check out the lights. - You wanna join? - Think I'm gonna pass. You'd rather walk around aimlessly and be bummed that Heidi's leaving? I am not gonna do that. All right, maybe just a little. It's just these past few days, man, all these feelings keep rushing back. I don't know what to do. Maybe she feels the same way. She wouldn't of gone to New York again. I feel like I'm having déjà vu. Look, Matt, I told you. I'm not gonna stand in the way of her dreams. Listen to me. You telling her how you feel is not standing in her way. All right, if anything, it might help lead her way. Look, I'm just gonna grab some dinner. All right. And hey, thank you for everything with Snowball Dance. I know it wasn't your forte. Ended up being the best part of my year. Hey, don't look so sad. New York's not that far away. I'm gonna come back and visit really soon. The whole reason we got milkshakes is so we can have a fun last night. Yeah, we know. It's been really great having you here. We're gonna miss you. Yeah, it has been really great. Even when you flooded the kitchen. Even when I flooded the kitchen. Will you be glad to go back to New York? Yeah. Why do you ask? You just look sad about it too. Well, I'm gonna miss everybody here. - Hey, Mr. Shepherd. - Hey. Hi. Milkshakes, huh? What is the occasion? Fun last night with Aunt Heidi. Aw. Hey, why don't you join us? No, I don't wanna intrude. No, it's okay. You can sit down. Okay. Well, I shouldn't be telling you this because I haven't given the grades out yet, but you're already celebrating. Tom, you made an A on the retake test. - For real? - Yeah, for real. - Nice work, Tom. - I knew you had it in you. Yeah, once I found out Ryan was taking Monica to the dance, I guess I was less distracted in class. Well, I'm not super up on the student gossip, but I do own a chaperone list, and Ryan's mom said he's taking Sarah Lang. Really? Well, I mean, it's probably too late. The dance is the day after tomorrow. Hey, how do you know unless you try? Yeah, you gotta take a risk. I'll be right back. I have to make a call. Teenage boys, am I right? Wanna try my milkshake? I got seven flavors. You got seven flavors? Oh, my gosh, that sounds so good, but I kinda wanted some real food. Hey, are you saying milkshakes aren't real food? We are personally offended. Hey, she said yes. - Yay! - All right! See? I hope you learned something here today. Yeah, sometimes you just gotta go for it. Hello? Hello! Grandma, Grandpa! - There's my peanut! Hey! - Sweetheart! Hey, bud! I didn't think you were gonna be here till Christmas day. Well, when we finally docked in Italy, we got Megan's message that you were watching the kids, and we figured we'd better come home and help. Not that we thought you were incapable. It's just we know you're very busy. - No, Aunt Heidi's been great. - Thanks. Now you're here on time for my pageant. Yeah! Where's John and Megan? They had to rent a car, so they're not gonna be here until tomorrow. Wait, if Grandma and Grandpa are here, does that mean you're gonna leave? No, I'm not gonna miss your pageant. - I'll leave right after. - Okay. It sounds like you've had a couple of wild days. Yeah, you have no idea. Well, come on in, and I'll fix you dinner. We're full. We just had milkshakes. But we're still hungry, so Grandma's gonna make something really healthy. Thanks, Mom. Come on, Grandma. Alas, the angel is here. She will bring word of what's to come. - Hey. - Hey. I cannot thank you enough for all that you did. I've actually never seen Tom and Katie in better moods. You raised some fantastic kids. I'm just happy I got to spend some time with them. And sounds like some time with Chris Shepherd. I know what you're thinking. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. You're thinking that seeing him again after all this time, it brought back all the feelings I used to have. Okay, maybe I was thinking that. And... you'd be right. What am I supposed to do? I mean, my boss finally sees me as a real artist, and she wants to help with my career. But all I wanna do is go to a high school dance with Chris Shepherd? I mean, I was so sure for so long that living in the city and being successful, that's all that mattered. But you know, then I came home, and I felt inspired to paint again. So maybe what you thought you wanted is different than what you actually needed. Yeah. Maybe. If I'm honest, I was kind of hoping you guys wouldn't come home in time, and I could stay, but then Mom and Dad showed up, so I knew I had to go back. Okay, that is very telling. Yeah. I think I really owe it to myself to see this through. Okay. I mean, that's okay. We'll always be here. Yeah, I know. But... Chris might not. Yeah, that's true, unless you tell him how you feel. Meg, I already broke his heart once. I cannot do it again. And plus, my life is so up in the air right now. I don't wanna drag him along. Okay. Well, I should go. Can you explain... the seven pizza boxes that I found in the trash? No, I cannot. Has all the food groups. It's fine. Bye. Hey, Katie, I have something for you. - You painted this for me? - I did, yeah. I love it. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Okay. - Bye, guys. Love you. - Thanks again. Travel safe. We're going to the airport. We're gonna make a stop first. No problem. - Bye. - Love you. This looks great. I thought you left already. Wanted to come by, see how it all turned out. Say goodbye. Well, it looks amazing, thanks to you. Thanks to us. Listen, Chris, this past week has been wonderful. I can see why high-school-me fell in love with you so easily. And present-day-you, how does she feel? She feels confused. Don't be. You went to New York to become this amazing artist, and you should do that. You should follow what you want. That's what I loved about you. That's what's what I've always loved about you. That's my ride. Bye, Chris. Goodbye, Heidi. Hey, let me help you. Thanks, Chris. So I'm glad to see you guys made it back in one piece. I know. What a crazy week. Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't help with the Snowball. It's okay. Heidi did an amazing job. Hope you can come see it all decked out tonight. The mural she did is a masterpiece. Tom has made it very clear we are only supposed to drop him off. Don't worry. John and I will find our way in. Today's Heidi's big day, huh? - Yeah. I hope it all goes well. - Yeah, me too. She seemed pretty upset when she left. - Really? - Yeah, she... She had this sad look in her eyes. Sort of like the one you have right now. You know, it's funny. When I came back from college, I thought I had everything I ever wanted. Truth is, I was always missing something. I wish you both would tell these things to each other. Timing is not right. It never will be if you're always waiting for it. I better get these into the fridge. Right, of course. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, tell Tom I will see him tonight. I will. Merry Christmas. Yeah, Merry Christmas. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thanks for coming. - Thank you so much. Heidi, come. I want you to meet Vince and Leo. Hi. Heidi is responsible for making the gallery what it is. All of these paintings have been acquired by her. Can you get me the gallery catalog? I want to show Leo the gallery painting we just sold. Sure. Nice to meet you. You are going to love his work. Don't you just wanna crawl inside this painting? That place looks so magical. It's beautiful. I love it. Julia talking up your art? No, not yet. Well, I'm sure she will soon. Maybe. But you know what? If she doesn't, that's okay. The only person that's gonna make time for my art is me. I have to go. What do you mean? I just mean... there's someplace I'd rather be. That one is right back there. Yes, right. Okay, yeah. Where are you going? I haven't had a chance to show off your painting yet. Julia, I can't work for the gallery anymore. You can't leave. This is your big opportunity. I don't belong here. I thought if I wanted to be a great artist, I had to move to the city and adapt to a certain lifestyle, but instead, I just completely lost track of why I wanted to paint in the first place. I miss that feeling of inspiration, when a moment is so overwhelming, you have no choice but to create. I had that when I was at home. When I was with Chris. Who? Julia, thank you so much for everything. This has been such a great opportunity, and I've learned so much, but it's not where I wanna be. - I have to go. - Don't leave yet. Look, we'll show some of your work to some agents. Maybe some other time. If I leave right now, I can still make the dance. Merry Christmas. What dance? Say Christmas! - Christmas! - Nice. This is amazing. Best Snowball in history. I mean, glitter usage aside. After the dance, we should hang that mural at the school. Couldn't agree more. You and Heidi did a wonderful job. Must be nice to have a night away from the kids, huh? Romantic night in a romantic setting is just what was needed. Brings back memories. Yes, it does. Yes, it does. Hey, we know you wish someone else was here, but try to have some fun tonight. I mean, this is all because of you. Hey! Hey. How about we finish that dance? What are you doing here? Well, I figured I ruined our last Snowball, so I might as well make up for it. And what about New York? Well, you told me to go for what I want, and... that's you. Here. Right now. - I love you, Heidi. - I love you too.
