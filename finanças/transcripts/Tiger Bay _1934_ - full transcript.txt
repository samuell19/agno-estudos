Of all the absurd rubbish I've ever read. Page after page of treacle, sugar and slough. People who write such tripe as this should be shot. Where on earth do you dig up such rubbish? My sister sent it from home. Bless her dear old heart. And probably bought it because she liked the cover. And what's more. Read it and thoroughly enjoyed it before sending it to me. And more than likely, like all her sex. Enjoyed all the sentimental issues within it. It's such rot, isn't it. Because women aren't really romantic. They're all out for what they can get. What do you know about women anyway? Baby Bunting. You mean, what don't I know about women. Now if she'd only had sense and sent me a detective story. A good thriller is worth reading. It gives you something to think about. Quite. How old fashioned. Give me the moderns every time. - The product of a misspent youth. Who have to dip their pens in disinfectant .. before writing. You are all dead wrong. I maintain there is romance everywhere. If only you look for it. There must be. Birth .. love .. death. You can't have those things without romance. Oh? What about the native quarters? My dear Ed, the native quarters or the slums. Are the very places where you will find romance. Do you really think that a man or girl .. Has got to have clean feet before they can be romantic? People are born, make love and die. Even in the slums. Don't they? They try to make a penny packet of seed grow in a home-made window box. Or have a dog that loves them. That can fight every other dog in the street. Why, there isn't a locality that is not packed with romance. Have you ever heard of Tiger Bay? Tiger Bay? I don't expect you have. You've not been out here long enough. Why, the very name is romantic. Romantic, my foot. Like this confounded mosquito. Stubborn, vindictive and damned unfriendly. What a fascinating name. I've a jolly good mind to go down and have a look round. Forget it. The bay is not very friendly to strangers. Especially inquisitive ones. You're not trying to put the wind up me, are you, sir? I think I know how to take care of myself. And Tiger Bay knows how to guard its secrets from impetuous youths. What really is Tiger Bay? The home of all the riff-raff of the seven seas. An agglomeration of negroes, lascars. Chinese, Arabs. The playground of every ship's crew that's entered this port. A pretty rough playground too, sometimes. That settles it. I'm going. It sounds marvellous. Come on sir, be a sport. Give us the lay of the land. I'll bet .. that I'll bring back proof that good in its most romantic form .. Exists even in Tiger Bay. You haven't got there yet. Now look, here is the town. This is the bridge leading across the river into Tiger Bay. And this is the main street. Old lady luck has been good to me. Hey, what do you think I am? A Millionaire? There big boy, where you going all dressed up like a dog's dinner? Hey, wouldn't you like a new hat? If you want to see anything worth seeing in here, it's in there. And it will cost you ten cents. - A whole ten cents? I think I can afford that. Your ticket. - Your ten cents. In you go. You'll get your money's worth. I always do. Now then Alfred, where you been all this time? I told you to get those bottles a quarter hour ago. Take them over there. Oh, for goodness sake! Now you've got that mess to pick up. What's the matter with you? You would be late for your own funeral. Have you got corns? Heaps of them. And carbuncles. And the blooming hump. What's the matter with you my lad, is creeping idleness. Here, here. Go easy. You ain't going to do no creeping here. I'll tell Miss Lui we've had enough. Lui, it's pretty full now. Alright. I'm nearly ready. Come out of there. What are you doing here, Letty? Don't be angry, Lui darling. But I do so want to see your new dance. You know you are not allowed in the dance-hall. I want to see what they think of your new dress. No. But where's the harm? I'm not a child. Whether you're a child or not. I forbid you to mix with that rabble. Why "rabble"? They are just enjoying themselves. They're happy. They're alive. They're not alive .. they're dead. Dead to everything that is really worthwhile. Anyway, you're not to go in to the dance-hall tonight or any other night. Why do you think I do this every night? Can't you guess? Don't you realise I want to take you away from all this? Letty, darling. Don't go and make things more difficult for me. Silence, please. Will everybody please go back to their places at once. I have pleasure in announcing tonight's special attraction. Oh, so you're back, are you? You will kindly behave yourself tonight or you don't come in here again. You talk too much .. Granny. Granny? So you are the little girl who sits very carefully upstairs? What's your hurry? Please let me go. Lui will be furious. She told me not to come in here. I don't wonder. You are so attractive. Let her go! But why? One seldom meets anyone .. So .. - Keep your hands off her. Oh go back to your dancing. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. And five is ten. You're out. Stop that! Stop that I say! Stop it, can't you. Here, let me get out. Let me get out! Here! Help me! Help me get out! Why don't you make trouble in your own club? Because nobody is big enough. Ha-ha-ha. Sit down here. There. I think that will be alright now. Comfy? You were very brave. I can't help poking my nose into other people's business. It is always dangerous. To interfere with other people's business in Tiger Bay. Dangerous? I didn't think this was .. - I take it you never think. However, now you will have time. Because I hope you will stay with us until your arm is better. Nothing would help my recovery more. What that young man wants is sleep and plenty of it, so clear out, all of you. Talk to a man who's lost a lot of blood. Never heard of such a thing. Never. What he wants is peace and quiet and that's what he's going to get. I think Fay wants to be alone with our young invalid. You know, you and your daughter have been awfully kind to me. My what? I'd like you to know young man that I'm a single woman and respectable. And moreover, proud of it. Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sorry I'm single or sorry I'm respectable? I thought you said the patient needed quiet. Laughing ain't a noise. It's a tonic. Now then Letty, out you go. You've done enough harm for one night without giving the boy a .. fever. It was my fault .. for disobeying Lui. I'm awfully sorry. - And I'm awfully glad. Yes, you don't lose much time, young man. Out, you. And you go to sleep. Let's have no more nonsense. Well, the rough house stopped her dancing. And then .. would you believe it, boys ..? The poor young man got jabbed in the arm with a knife. You know what that pretty Chinese girl needs? Some man to protect her interests. All these upsets are no good for her business. You're a marvel, governor. A blinking marvel. She pays us for protecting her against ourselves. No, no. If she stumps up. We'll see that no-one else queers our pitch. I can't forgive myself Lui for bringing this trouble on you. Olaf and his crowd live by making trouble. You were just the last straw. You gave him his chance. What do you mean, his chance? He has been here three times this week. On purpose, to make trouble. - Why? They've marked me down as their next victim. It's just blackmail. But this time they'll find they've bitten into granite. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Well, young man. Still alive? - Very much alive. Now you sit up and take this broth. On that elbow. That's right. There we are. Now then, drink it up. And don't you talk so much. You can't drink and talk at the same time. At least, not if you're a gentleman. Okay, Florence Nightingale. - Impudence. Now then, you mustn't talk. Alright, I'll listen. The dear boy is better. Sleep has done the trick. There is no fever now. Except the fever of love. Is it Miss Letty? Why not? I call it most suitable. They're like me. Young, good-looking, respectable. Oh, what A romance. Oh well .. every dog has his day. Alfred. What do you call this stuff, eh? Worm. You here again? I am, sweetheart. Tell Miss Chang I'd like to see her. [ Door knocks ] Come in. [ Chinese language ] That's alright. I need no introduction. Miss Chang, can we talk business? With you? - With me. Let's forget last night. And get down to brass tacks. Aren't you going to ask me to sit down? Go. - Okay. I don't feel very hungry, so I think I'll just have a .. Black coffee and no sugar. Yes, Miss. Probably, later on I shall .. - Feel a little peckish. She'll do. Well. In my opinion, she's the finest little ship that ever sailed out of the port. Is that a deal? - Sure. Good. So long. - So long. If you won't accept me as your manager at my price .. You are asking for trouble. So you're threatening me. Why .. no. Certainly not. You see, I'm .. psychic. I can see future events before they happen. Your so-called management would cost too much. Yes, but my good management would prevent a lot of trouble. You dare not threaten the house of Chang. I too am psychic. And I warn you. If you interfere with my business .. You are courting disaster. [ Chinese language ] Before long, you'll be very glad of our protection. Before long, you may be very sorry that you ever threatened me. This way. Pardon .. have you got The Times? Time for what? Hi, sweetheart. Why so thoughtful, Lui? Letty, please don't go out again alone. But darling, nothing horrible like last night has happened for ages. I thought I'd made Tiger Bay safe for you. But I was wrong. Don't worry. It might have been much worse. Except for that poor boy's arm. Hey. You and the rest of the crowd, get out of this place in ten minutes .. or .. Understand? Where do you think you've been to, eh? - Me not say. Me not say. What do you mean you won't say? - Me not say. Tong, what's the matter? Me not say. Me not say. Those men kill me. [ Chinese language ] The service in this joint is rotten. Where are all the waiters? My waiters have left. You know that. The first fulfilment of your psychic visions, I suppose. I don't understand. Alfred. Take the order for these .. gentlemen. 'Gents', my foot. What would you like, sir? [ Chinese language ] Hello, Lui. - Hello. Are you quite recovered now? - Yes. Thanks to good nursing. Many a true word spoken in jest. We'll leave the patient in your hands as we've got the shopping to do. Come on, Letty. Now Mick. I mean, Mr Brooks. Don't try to be too rash on your first day up. Come on, ducky. Come on. Don't keep me waiting. I've got ten chickens to get. Won't you sit down? You know Miss Chang, Tiger Bay. Is one of the strangest experiences I've ever had. Obviously. - Oh, I don't mean this arm. I mean. Don't think me impertinent. You. Why me? You are so unlike all my previous conceptions of the Chinese. You've always thought of us as wearing pigtails. And with eyes like two slits. - I'm afraid that's true. You still think of us as the caricature of fifty years ago. I can't understand how a lady of your culture, Miss Chang .. Ever settled in Tiger Bay. All our years of culture could not prevent the bursting of that bubble. The Chinese revolution. Look. I want to show you something. My father was a Manchu of the Mandarin class. The Manchus ruled China for nearly 300 years. And then. The country became divided against itself. The two red crosses, the rulers and the ruled. Tore at each other's throats. Just as these fish will fly at each other .. If I draw the glass that keeps them apart. Look. That is what happened in Ni Ho. During the Chinese revolution when Letty was an infant. And I was a child of seven. Drunk with victory, the soldiery ran amok. And an orgy of looting and sabotage ensued. So my father and I escaped with Letty. And after many hardships. Reached Tiger Bay. He started this eating house. And combined with the sale of antiques. Managed to make a home for us. Even though it was in Tiger Bay. Downstairs is merely our source of livelihood. But this .. is our home. China. Thanks. Letty was a sacred trust from my father's friend. Four years ago, my father died. I inherited his business. And his sacred trust. To me, she's a much loved younger sister. To be guarded and guided. And now .. she is the very peach of my eye. If you will excuse a mixed metaphor. I could go on mixing metaphors about her. All day long. Surely, Mr Brooks you haven't fallen in love already? I love Letty. I love her so much. I can't bear the very thought of living without her. And how does Letty feel towards you? Fay, did you hear that? He's in love with me. Now, be careful. Now go on, don't sit there. What are keyholes for? But is it fair? Fair? Of course it ain't, but listen all the same. Well, I couldn't really. - Well, I can. You saved Letty and she nursed you back to health. But that doesn't mean that she loves you. No .. of course not. But I don't believe she thinks I'm so bad. You've got him. You've got him! Like a rat in a trap. And what did Lui say about it? She says she'd be all in favour of getting you off our hands. The day Letty comes and tells me she loves you .. We will talk. It won't be my fault if it's not this week. He says he's going to pop the question as soon as he can. And I know what the answer will be. Fill her up? - I should say so. Mark it down on my tab. Won't you buy a thirsty girl a drink, huh? Not half I wouldn't. Boy! A nice glass of wine, please. Ah! I did not know you wanted to murder. Now keep your mouth shut otherwise we'll shut it for you. Compris? Out of it! Ha-ha-ha. Them grapes remind me of a garden I used to have. Yeah? Lovely lot of flowers. - Don't like flowers. No? - No. They always put me in mind of funerals. Give me the shivers, they do. Talking about funerals. - Yep? [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] [ Man's laughter ] [ Man's laughter ] The cowards. Oh, the cowards! Poor faithful. Harmless Alfred. And that is the whole story. The trouble is. That although we know they murdered this man. We have no proof. You should have come to us in the first place. When he stabbed Mr Brooks. I have my business to think of. Police and business, don't go well together in Tiger Bay. Have you told anyone about this murder? - No. Do not do anything that will put this character on his guard. Carry on as if nothing has happened. And leave everything to us. You understand? [ French language ] You know Michael, it's grand to see you without that splint. It's grand to be able to light a pipe again. Are you suggesting that I didn't light it properly? Sorry. But pipe-lighting .. is man's work. [ Birdsong ] What's that? Come here. I'll show you. That's whistling Rufus. Do you know he can imitate any kind of bird. A funny old bloke. What's he doing in a place like this? He says he's looking for the bluebird of happiness. Isn't he silly. Not so silly as he seems. What's in that bottle? Medicine? Oil. One's got to be well oiled to whistle. Are you going to whistle again? I'm afraid I shall have to. Come on, somebody .. come on! You here again? - Yes. And what's more, we want some food. Where is Alf? - You should know. Come on. I'm as hungry as a hunter. Mind you're not the hare instead of the hound. I'm going to have some chicken noodle soup, please. And I'll have a basinful of that. And the same for me. Here. I took me over half an hour to get there. All round the back dives and all. What do you think happened when I go there? I'd forgotten the blinking number. You are very brave to eat here. - Why? Since my staff left. I've been doing my own cooking. You don't mean to say that ..? You wouldn't dare. When the name of Chang is threatened. I dare anything. Is there any other dish you fancy? Well, can't you say nothing? That's a nice thing. Leaving me here, damn nearly starving. While you're going around filling yourselves with Chop Suey. Ain't you got no news? - News? That Madame, that yellow thing. She'd poison us. You've got a nerve, calling anybody yellow. I ate more than you. Oh my .. my stomach is terrible. Shut up, you. She couldn't poison your guts. You ain't got none. Pain? What do you know about pain? You wait until you get something like this. Please, Stumpy. Please .. Why draw attention to it? It's indecent. Why don't you put a boot on it or something? To look at you, anyone would think you are a crook. Well, I am ain't I? Oh, let's get down to business. Now listen, boys. She's a tough proposition. But she's not going to beat me. Rough houses don't seem to upset her. The chink servants leaving her high and dry. And even the disappearance of that guy .. Alf. It makes no difference. There is only one way to get at her. And that's .. through the girl. I'm terribly sorry about this upheaval. But everything will be put right shortly. That's fine. Gosh, what is the matter with everybody? It's alright. There will be dancing in a little while. Okay .. come on, baby. Let's sit down. Dancing? There's others I'd like to see dancing. At the end of a rope. Fay, I'm going out. - Going out? Where? To get help. I still have friends in Tiger Bay. What, going out as late as this? - It's such a lovely night, Fay. Oh I see. He wants to see what you look like by moonlight, eh? Yes please, nurse. - Go on, both of you. [ Singing: ] "I'm as old as the hills." "You can't imagine how old." "My bones is all brittle and my blood's running cold." "I'm an old, old nigger." "Just a worn-out figure." "That's nearing his judgment day." "I'm just like an old fool that's all worn down at the sole." "I'm as bent as the willow and as blind as the mole." "And as far as I can figure." "I'm just an old nigger." "That's nearing his judgment day." "Hallelujah." "I'm crying now and I pray to the Lord." "To consider me kindly." "When I comes aboard." "Find a place for this nigger." "With his worn-out vigour." "When he gets to his judgment day." That's the Corne D'or lightship. I didn't come here to look at lightships. I came here to tell you that .. - That you love me? Fay told me I was in love with you. Long before your arm was out of the sling. Naturally, I knew I was all the time. And then she said that you were in love with me. She was quite right. Long before my arm was out of the sling. Go on, Stumpy. Come on, boys. Oh, Michael. Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it lovely being in love with someone one loves. It's lovely, my love. Being in love with a lovely girl one loves. Michael, you are laughing at me. - I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing with you. You and you, go in there and look after those tables on the right. And you, go in and take those over there on the left. Yes, ma'am. Yes and you, sunshine. You stop here. Free drinks for anybody who can play the piano. I can, and I'm thirsty. Bless my auntie's eyeballs. Ha-ha-ha. Where is Michael? What have you done with him? He's safely locked up in a cellar downstairs. We couldn't think of hurting him. Unless you scream for help. In which case. You .. you wouldn't dare do anything. When Lui hears of this .. When she hears, she'll pay for your release. You are quite safe .. as long as you behave yourself and keep quiet. Otherwise there is going to be a lot of trouble, for you and your boyfriend. Take her upstairs. Don't let them touch me! Don't let .. - Shall I muzzle her, Guv? Keep quiet, girl. My dear girl, we are not going to touch you. It is Lui Chang that we are going to touch. She believed it when you said you put him in the cellar, huh? Stop drinking and give me my hat. Come on, make it snappy. A woman in love believes anything. There we are. Pleasant dreams. Here, come on you. You're ugly mug will give the girl nightmares. You're no Clarke Gable, either. Say, where's Letty? - He's taken her out. Out? It's a beautiful moonlit night and Michael is asking the great question. He's proposing to her. He as good as told me so. Oh Fay, you must be mad. Why did you let them go? Where have they gone? I don't know where. They never told me. Lovers don't say where they're going. At least they didn't when I was a girl. And I had a good many chances. Oh Fay, why did you let them go? Well sir, if you are right, we shall be able to round them up pretty soon. If I'm right? Now, Gaston. You have hurt my feelings. Of course I'm right. Do you suppose I've been hanging about here all .. [ French language ] Why that's the young man who's staying at Miss Chang's. Has the doctor gone home yet? - No, sir. Then ask him to come in. - Very good, sir. Cherchez la docteur, tout de suite. - Oui, Monsieur. Don't you worry, my dear. They've lost all sense of time and everything else except themselves. After all, a first proposal is a great event in any girl's life. Especially when it's the man she loves. Oh, stop talking! Let me think. It's midnight and they're not back. - Nor was Cinderella. You are too late. We're shut. I came to talk. Not to eat. About Letty? What have you done with her? Nothing yet .. and won't if you are reasonable. What do you mean? Wouldn't it be better to talk upstairs? I'll sound the gong if I want help. First let me warn you. Any violence to me. And you'll never see Letty again. What have you done with her? At present .. she is my guest. How do I know you have got her? Your terms? You are much better now. Drink this. Whistling Rufus? Amongst other things, I am a police agent. Whistling Rufus. My name is Wingrove. Do you feel well enough to tell us what happened? Where is Letty? What have they done with her? Then the girl Letty was with you? Four of your best men, quickly. - Very good, sir. Don't worry. Come on. Something has gone wrong. I know it. I can smell it. Don't be so white-livered. What the hell is wrong with you? Where is Olaf? And why is he so long? I tell you something has happened. Why not cut out the booze? You're as near as jimjams as makes no difference. Well, I'm not frightened. - Oh no. Ha. It's only a rumour. It's alright. We've got the place surrounded now, sir. They know you by sight, so keep hidden until we are inside. Open up! Open up! Open up! Shout again. - Open up! The Police demand you open up. Open up. You think you've got us, eh? Well, you haven't. How do you like this. Take him away. Well, he won't laugh no more. Don't get the wind up, Stumpy. Out over the roofs. We'll take the girl with us. It's alright, Letty. Look out. Look out. Put them up. It's alright. Major Wingrove is waiting for you outside. Come along. Don't keep on bluffing. I know just what you can pay. No wise person keeps much money in the house. We have taken the trouble to find out. That you prefer your own safe to a bank. You are right. It's useless to bluff any longer. What's the game? I want the key to my cabinet. [ Chinese language ] Here is all I possess. The savings of nineteen long years. You're richer than I thought. - Not so fast. When you give me your written instructions for Letty's release. But not before. [ Chinese language ] That's the way I like to do business. Quietly and politely. He should get there in about five minutes. Maybe I'll pass them on the way. I'll be seeing you. Wait. You've forgotten something. Your knife. Lui, Lui! Oh, Letty darling. Thank God you're safe. Are you alright? You were a naughty child to go when I told you not to. Are you alright? I think the young lady had better go to bed. She's had a very trying time. That's right, Letty. You run along. Michael, look after her. You'd better know, Miss Chang, that I am a Police agent. Was this an accident? No. I killed him after extracting an order for Letty's release. But it was too late. Do you realize, Miss Chang .. That this is murder? Not murder. It's an execution. Such men are not fit to live. No-one in this country. Is allowed to take the law into his own hands. What will they do to me? Will they ..? 0h, I don't think so. But crime, however justified, cannot go unpunished. You mean, 'imprisonment'? Life? But you can't. I've struggled so hard. Letty could never be happy knowing I was in prison. There must be some way out. Yes. There are still some secrets known only to the East. Don't let them see me. Have them remember me. As I was. [ Chinese singing ] [ Chinese singing ] [ Chinese singing ] ..rOs..
