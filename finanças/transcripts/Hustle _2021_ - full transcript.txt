Hello. Yeah, Mrs. Komolafe checking out of room 419. Aww, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hello ma'am. Room 419? Okay, I'll get the key across to you, right away. Thank you. Allow me to open the door for you, madam. Thank you, madam. Thank you, ma'am. (door closes) Yeah... The client will be asking me for the property. Will you stop this unnecessary packaging What's propty? Abandoned property! Call it what it is! Trying to sound nice! Rubbish! Telling me... It's based on... (spittting) The long... (more spitting) understanding that we have already. You say what? Wait... There you go! I got it! (laughing) I'm sorry about that. Listen... Let me tell you... This long English of yours' isn't my style! This isn't my first time we're doing business together! When it comes to money or business, we talk in figures! Not this long English you keep bandying around! This is what I've got... It's your business if you aren't okay with it. Do you understand me? Okay... This is my last offer! Are you with me? If that doesn't work for you, then you should leave! I advise you accept my offer, and you just... Look, this is... Let's go upstairs... You go about with ties, instead of taking the deal and get a small commission! The small commissions do make sense sometimes! Imagine going around with ties in this kind of terrible heat! Anyone who sees your knotty hair would think it's some kind of style, but it's actually the heat punishing you! It's the sun that burnt your hair while you are... Regina, my Regina! Wonderful! Good afternoon. Wow! Regina, my Regina! (laughing) Frankly, I'm not happy with you! Of course, I'm not happy with you! You simply abandoned me all this while! Come on, it's work! I've been very busy. I'm so sorry, please! Anyway, it's alright. How are you enjoying Lagos? I'm sure you're missng Abuja already. I miss Abuja, I'm teling you! I'm sorry I came late, guys. Have we come into an agreement? No, we haven't. Come on, Otunba... We haven't come to any agreement because your coleagues are trying to cheat me! No, sir... What's no sir? Maybe you meant, Nosa! We can't cheat you, sir. Indeed! No, we can't. Otunba, you know that if anybody on this table is going to cheat you, I, Regina, will never cheat you! Not for any other reason aside the fact that we've done business together before! This isn't our first business together, and... You know how we do it. You're right about that. We've... surely done business together... Oh my Regina! You see, I've actually had the desire to tell you this a long time back! I'm quite sure you used my name where they made that charm for you! That's because I lose control of myself whenever you approach me this way! (laughing) I'm only doing this because of you! Thank you. No problem. Erm... Dele, bring my cheque book. Let's wrap this up quickly, because I've got other businesses to attend to. Dele? Where's this boy... Oh, I apologise. I saw him go into the convenience when I was coming in. What's that? Toilet? Rest room, yes. He went to pee? (laughing) I suspect that boy has Gonorrhea! The frequency at which he pees, like fifteen to twenty times, a day, is abnormal! Anyway, there's no problem. I'll go get it myself. Mind you, it's because of you! Thank you. No problem. Okay, let me do that. I'll be back shortly. Take anything you... That's not for you, because you've taken something already! It's the ladies. I'll see you, guys. What the... I'm so sorry! Let me... I can't believe I... Ehn... em... I can't believe I did this! I... It's okay. It's alright. Do you mind if I take care of it? In my room. I... I stay here. I see. You're there by yourself? Well, it's a hotel. I see. Okay, that's alright. Should I take it off now... I can pull it off! That's not a problem! It's not a problem at all. I can even... in fact, let me just... I'll just fold it straight... You don't have to, sir... Let me fold it to make it easier for you! I'm very good at folding things! In fact, one of my businesses is a laundry, err... this thing... Laundry, err... business, yes. Do you mind if I grab my bag? Grab it! Grab anything you want! Oh my goodness! (cllearing throat) What's that? Oh... erm... Em... I'm ready. Err, yes, I'm ready to... Regina... She is ready... err, sorry... I'm still... tipsy... That's fine, I'll give you some support. Do you mind helping me? Of course, I will! Whatever the help you need, I'll be here for you! (laughing) I'm here for you! After you. My goodness! Em... I'll be right back! Yes, the cheque book I... My goodness, this is too much! This is incredible! This night is going to be awesome! Don't sit there! Not a chance! (singing) Sit right there! (singing again) Let me help you take that off. It won't be my first! Come on, let me help there! Let me help, baby! Oh my goodness! I'll be with you in a moment, baby! Thank you. (door closes) Please, make yourself comfortable. Thank you. (laughing) Err, do you mind if I... Not at all, please. This will be right here. Give me a second to call laundry. Okay. Yes. Alright. Hello... Yes, laundry. That's right, please come to 419. Thank you. Yesss! Sorry, just err... It's okay. It has been a bit hot... You're... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm also feeling hot... I'll just, erm... I'll just go in to freshen up for you... That's alright. Oh, awesome God! (laughing) This is what you call idi-omatic expression! This is the honey pot! You'll surely feel me! This is precisely what's going to take all my money! Did you call me? No... I'm just feeling hot, and... taking off my shoes to... Just to get some air circulation to... (clears throat) I feel better... Of course, you do! Okay, tell me, Rita Dominic... No, my name isn't Rita Dominic. I said my name is Rita Obi. I'm not an actress. Well, the names sound same to me. Rita, Rita Dominic... Don't say it now... Oh, wow, nice watch! It's a 2019 limited edition! Oh my gosh! That's 2.4 million Naira! Wow, you must be so wealthy! You must be quite smart to know that! (laughing) The money overwhelms me too... What a beautiful, gold necklace! That's right. Really nice... Oh, goodness! (moaning in pleasure) I didn't know you wear things like this! I wear a lot of things! I wear... eh... The perfume on you is quite... Yeah, you like it? Yes, it is quite... I'll just tuck this in for you... Thank you. Yes... You know what I'll just, erm... While we wait for laundry, I'll take this... Oh goodness! And erm... I'll be right back. (laughing) Otunba, this is your point of no return! My goodness! Look at... What the, hell! This is a fantastic asset that requires a good investment! Oh, you'll surely get good feel of me! (yawning) By the time I handle this... Oh my... How fortunate I used the local, power booster earlier... By the time I... (yawning) By the time I'm done with you... Let me just rest a little... You'll be alright, I guaranbtee! Look at those buttocks! (yawning) (coughing) Awesome job! Look at that, babe! Come on, let's get to work! (excited) (speaking Igbo) Where is the condom? Come on, why that? What's mba condom? It means, no show without condom! There must be a show for me, please, baby! Oh my... In fact, I've got two here! ♪ Take me away with you... ♪ Give me a moment, babe! (knock at door) Who the hell, is that? (knocking continues) You're knocking at the wrong room, please! (door knock persists) Who... what sort of... Who the hell is that? Come on, you're knocking at the wrong door! Who is that? Come on, it's Otunba! Open the door! You're in trouble already! I've been busy praying for you, sir! You're praying for me, indeed! Did you realise I've just been robbed! What! Did you know I've been robbed, Dele? They robbed me... what... Sorry, sir... Oh my! I was protecting you, sir! So, this is what you've been doing here! You're here with a woman! No, sir... You're here with a woman when... Give me money for my transportation, please! There we go! Oh my goodness! This is what you were doing! I was protecting you, sir! Protecting me? It's for security reasons, sir! See, they've robbed me of everything! How about your chain? My 2.4 Million Naira wristwatch! Damn! Has anyone in your family ever made 2.4 million Naira before? You're in trouble, Dele! I repeat that you're in such a deep shit! You, you... Who robbed you? You're asking who robbed me? You dare ask who robbed me, Dele! They went away with your wristwatch? You're so...(phone vibrating) They're calling you, right? You don't seem to understand... Boss! Me? You need to see this, boss! Me... Who picture is this? Oh goodness! Wait a moment! Whose picture is this, Otunba? Jesus! Otunba, that's a nude picture of you! This is bad! This is really bad, Dele! Oh goodness, Rita! I knew it! When I saw her behind, I knew she was trouble, but didn't know she's a criminal! Rita! Oh my! Oh my! You see what I've been saying, Otunba! Who is calling? Otunba... Hello? Hello Otunba. Yes, who is this? I take it that you've seen the photos, right? Erm... yes, I've seen them, but what do you want from me? You can't hurt my boss... Get the hell away from here! You'll come to no good, you mad man! You already know if you don't want these photos to go public! This will ruin your political career! 500,000 Dollars? Tell him 4,900! ... Take 4,900 because my boss can't pay that much! 500,000 Dollars? My boss can't afford such sum! Our last offer is 4,900 Dollars! You can't pay that much money, boss! That's a lot! I was going to say that... That's a lot of money! Quite! (overlapping conversation) Exactly my point! Taking out $100 from the money makes some sense. That girl is a genuine low life! Erm, Dele... Sir? Do you know what's going to happen? I'm committed to protecting you, sir! It's alright... (overlapping conversation) One of us is going to die... You're taking off your shoes, sir... This is just a start! It's going to look abnormal when people see you like this... We'll definitely get back home! You're about removing clothes too! We'll get home! I'm a male, sir! Only the two of us are in this room... Please, don't do that, sir! One of us... There's a bad feeling about this, boss! Will be carried out of this room on a stretcher! One of us is going to die! You're in a deep shit! I'm not the thief! On the contrary, I protected you! Dele! I was being robbed and defrauded, and you were here... Someone was going to rob you... You were here with a woman! Not at all! I was going to... Perhaps you were being robbed here too? I was just getting started... Really? One of us will die... (chaotic exchange) You're so done in, Dele! ♪ Singing ♪ (phone vibrating) ♪ singing continues ♪ (phone vibrating continues) Come on, give me the phone! Haven't I warned you severally not to touch my phone? I was going to give it to you... Spare me that! (phone vibrating starts again) Yes, what's happening? Hello Baba G Speak. I've got new list of clients for you. I see. Seven? Eight new clients. Okay, no problem. We'll meet up, then. Where can we meet? Let's do same place, tomorrow. Yeah. Baby... Please! What's the problem? Can't I play with you again? Okay, I'm sorry. What's your prob... Come on, what is it? Can't I pay with you again? That was like the... easiest money ever! (door slams shut) We're never failing, baby! (laughing) Don't you feel it? My babe, let's get down to it! (laughing) You so intoxicate me! How did you do it? Just within two days? That's brain! That's why they call me Baba G! Baba G can't be reduced to just an entity, do you understand me? Baba G is for the universe! Baba G... Like I have everythig under control! Baba G... Sweetheart, we're never failing! Amen! No one can equal us, babe! We're firmly in control of this town! This is what I call pepper soup! Baby... we're never failing! I often have headache whenever I see good money! You don't know what's going on, my love! (laughing) We're never failing, baby! Sweetheart, do you remember the time... Come on, what's that! Hmmm, real ibo girl! I told you! Do you remember our first gig? When you told me I'm the smartest guy... You've ever met in your life? Yeah... I'll so spoil you with money! We're never failing, baby! (doorbell dings) (doorbell dings again) (doorbell dinging continues) Baba G isn't... (door slams shut) Baba G isn't around! Look here... Look here, Ibo girl, I've tolerated you and your nonsense for a very long time! Baba G, himself, called me this morning! What's happening there? You better don't let me get rough with you this morning! Do you understand me? Come on, what's with the quarrel? You don't respect me, Baba G! Will you excuse me, please! You guys know I've got neighbours upstairs! It's better for you to bring the fight inside, you know! Come on, let her in! What's coming over you! My babe... Telling me Baba G isn't around... What's up with you, big girl! You wanted to start a fight with her outside... Come on, let's get inside! Oh baby! (hisses) Good morning, and how are you? Good morning, and I'm good. I hope... What is it? In spite of the money we're making, you still use all these cheap stuff? What's this? What's all these? Tommy Hillfiger... Will you stop that! (laughing) What's happening, girl? I see. Yeah. You've got to get ready for the gym. Yeah. We've got our mark there. For the second time this week! It's almost like, with every passing day, this guy just looses respect for me, and I don't understand it! I know we're in a no-string attached relationship, but I don't rub things in his face! So, why is he rubbing it in my face? Are you sure this no-string relationship of yours is paying off? With that silence, I guess that's a yes! It's complicated, Seun. Yeah, I'm getting what I want, I'm just not comfortable with the side chics! You're always talking about this guy! You've had a conversation with him, and he's not listening! Then, end it! End it and leave! When you end it, maybe he would have some senses! Peole always do when they are about losing something precious to them! Come on, what's the point of all this! So, I'm suposed to just get up and leave like that so he could have sense? Of course! Girl, that's too risky! Too risky? Chichi, is there something you aren't telling me? Perhaps there's something you're hiding from me, your friend? There's nothing to lose if you tell me, Chichi! (phone ringing) I've got news for you! You're going to take me out for shopping if I tell you this deal! Yeah? Come on, hold on! I found a guy for you. The cutest guy! Actually, I didn't find him, he's Steve's friend. Baritone voice, beard gang, a real gentleman! I'm not with Baba G. Why are you sounding like this? Why are you sounding sleepy? By this time, with who? Girl, get off the phone! We've got work to do! That's the mark. Baba G, honestly, you need to respect me more! Why would you bring your baby mama into this house? Aren't there hotel rooms? Because you don't think I'm important, that's why you don't have any respect for me! I work my ass off! I put food on your table! I also put food on their tables too! The boobs they come to show you, and the ass they come to collect money for! I provided for them! Hey girl... You've got to slow down right now! (chuckling) You calim to be the brain... Which brain? The one in your head? That's for fish! Are you with me? I, Baba G... Are you listening? I'm the head... and the brain of this operation! You just tell them to respect me, okay? Tell them to respect me, Chinyere! Or you can go lure the men into hotel rooms and get information by yourself since you're the brain! Why do you even need me... if you're the almighty brain? Watch! (hisses) You've been going beyond your bounds for a long time, and I keep warning you... Chichi! Chi... Chichi? What? Are you out of your senses? Would you get the proper instruction before you leave the house? I'm doing this on my own! You? You, Chichi? You'd be lucky to get out of this unscathed! You better not mess things up, because you're only going to get me really angry! Watch me! I see! Here we go! I'm going to clip those wings of yours, I guarantee! You just proved you lack manners, and I'm going to teach you some! Babe, do we really need to meet your parents today? Yea, absolutely. Mom is expecting us to start with her, and I haven't seen her in ages. So, we have to go. Didn't your father just get the new Escalade? Babe, this is a nice car. Wel, he hasn't seen you in years... and babe, he has never met me! You know me, that first impression matters! No, scratch that. This is a very very nice car! It gets us from point A to B, and that's all that counts. Well, it goes a long to show how much the value you have. That's all I'm saying. Can we just talk about something else! Well, as long as I find something else to talk about. By the way, what do you think of Lagos in the next 10 years time? Well, the population explosion that we all fear will, obviously, be knocking at our doosteps. Obviously, there'll be a lot more people, and that would worsen the traffic. I think it's all down here, if you ask me. So, what about you? You have been to Nigeria a couple of times, at least. You got a first impression. What do you think? Baby, I just got in, and you want me to go meet my in-laws, looking like a chimp on display! You know me! Wow! Look at me! I look all sticky! Baby, you're beautiful! Come on, long flight or short doesn't affect you in any way, because you're simply beautiful. You think so? I know so, babe. Besides, I love you. And I love you too. Now, that's a good one. That's some good energy I'm feeeling right now. So, there's an upscale part of downhill lagos. We have erm... Fela's shrine. We have the beaches. We have amazing clubs. This is one of the greatest cosmopiltan cities in the sub saharan Africa. ... Okay, I'm looking forward to that. So, get ready, because I'm giving you a good time of your life. I can't wait, okay. That's talking! That's some good energy I feel here. I stilll feel dirty, though. We've got to make you clean, baby. Come on, stop it! You're making me blush... Oh yeah, whatever. Driver, let's hurry up, please. Okay sir. (laughing) Wait a moment! You're already have a hard on! It's always ready, yes! Perhaps I should give you from this angle... Oh my world! Baby, what's happening? Diza, Diza... Baba G... Yes? Does Yetunde still come to this house? What Yetunde are you talking about? I don't see her again! ... She is nothing. You're the one I'm interested in. Stop! That means there's another woman in this house, right? Look here, I own this house. It's my house, but she is here because we're doing business together. That's all we've got together! Come on, you know me! I'm working on making some big money now, and I'm talking really big money! As soon as I get it, I'm coming straight to your house! I'm coming to meet your parents to ask for your hands in marriage! (doorbell dinging) Get the door, please. Don't worry, babe... The key isn't working... Don't worry, everything is fine... Gabriel? Baba G, get this door open. Babe... What's wrong with this girl? (hissing) (door opens and closes) (muttering) Who are you? Is this what you left me stranded for? (laughing) At least, now you know who is more important! Get out! You say what? (speaks in Igbo) I dare you! I dare yoy to try it with me! See, you better watch your mouth, because I'm not in anyway like Yetunde! So, you speak with Yetunde? What for? Why will I be speaking to Yetunde? To say what? Why would I talk to the president of baby mama's association? For what, exactly? Is it to ask her for permission to come and see you? See, I've got a lot of Yoghurt, or whatever you call it, in my system, thanks to Baba G. So, I'll advise you to clean the entire house... You clean the laundry, you clean the bedroom, everywhere! You know why? Because I have my DNA everywhere... What exactly are you trying to do? I would have beaten you blue black! I'll punch the daylight out of you! What a gut! Hadiza... Just calm down. Anyway, my darling... Thank you for the money, and thank you for the honey. Especially the honey! You're really trying now! Right? Don't worry, if you need me to come, just call me. I'll be a call away. Not after that Chinese style we did! Maybe we should try wheel barrow next time! That's my girl! I'll see you around No problem. My Hadiza! Chi babe, what's up? I did... I did most of the work... so I get 60% 60 what? Come on, don't be upset. Come give me some gist about what went down... Tell me what happened there, babe. I don't give a damn about you and your whores, okay? Chinyere, come on give me some gist... Baba G is at it again! Chi babe, we'll be having another contract! Baba G, we need to stop! You see this man right there? That's our next mark! This is Mr. Hamilton. Right? He is a politician. Babe, politics money! A heavy one at that! Do you understand? You know, he's more like a godfather! Not a king himself, but a kingmaker! So, he's a knid of power broker! Do you understand me? Babe, this is big money! He ususally organises prayer meeting at his residence, every Friday. Big money, babe! That should be easy for you to achieve. Right? Do this for us, babe... Stop. Do this for you man... Bullion van! Baby, you should have allowed me get into the hotel room I paid for, first. Your parents are late! Better them, than us. But you know nobody keeps me waiting! No one keeps Hilda Anthony, waiting! I could leave! I should leave! If they really want to see me, they should come to our hotel room! That's not going to happen. It will never happen! And I really hate the fact that you bring this thing up about you paying hotel bills all the time! If my parents live there, I'll be with them right now, then we won't be having this conversation! Well, forgive me for my statement of fact. You know I pay for everything because I love you. And you know what? You shouldn't that mind I'm on the receiving end. My dear son, Olatunde! Mom! It's so good to see you, mom. Come on, rise up. How are you? ... Look at you! Have a seat. Hello there. Come on, stand up! Why? Why are you eating rice, Tunde? Respect! You should have ordered for pounded yam and garnished vegetable! We just wanted something light... Really? So, this is something light... Good afternoon, good afternoon. What's that? Can we sit, please? Yes, you may sit, please. Thank you, daddy. Come on, sit, Tunde. Thank you, sir. She just greeted us. Greeted us? Yes. That's great. Tunde, Tunde! My son looks more like me each passing day! No now, it's just the complexion. What are you saying? Dad, you know we can have this conversation all day! (laughing) Just look at you! It's good to see you again. See, this Lagos traffic is unbelievable! It took us two hours to get here! Exactly! Anyway, it's good to see you son. So, for how long are you going to be around? Well, I was looking at... If you ask me, I'd say we've ben around way too long! I can't stand the heat in Nigeria! He isn't talking to you! He's asking our beloved son! So, Olatunde, my dear, how long are you staying? Well, I'm looking at... maybe a month. A month, wow! A month? We've already talked about this... Baby no! Listen, that was before I felt the heat! Erm, my dear, heat regardless, I'm sure our son would ensure that you have an enjoyable stay. Trust me, I'l give her a good time. There's no problem at all. I've got this experienced and good agent who could arrange the next flight for her return, and you could stay! What? See, Tunde, I'll call daddy as soon as I see a sign! A sign that it's time to leave! And... what sign are you looking for? Tunde, please! Erm, I'm pressed. I think I need to go to the rest room. Please, excuse me. ... Alright, I'll be right back. Easy, my dear. Hmmm, Tunde's father... Yes? I'm hoping our son is not bringing this thing home as his wife? This is big trouble! Oh my! This is big trouble! She'll surely have me ready too! Just look at the way she is exposing herself to all! She'll surely find me ready! Nonsense! Hey handsome. I see you have your hands full in there. Is that your wife? Erm... I didn't ask for a whistle the last time I checked. I'd like to take you to a proper joint. Buy you a drink. What do you say? I like to drink... When I hand out during the day. What's your name? What would you like it to be, today, love? ... Meet me. You eat nicely. Oh, you noticed! I went to finishing school in London. That's where you learn how to. So, what are your plans? I need to call dad. What rudeness! I was talking to her, and she said she needs to call her father! That's how they behave over there! Tunde is really bringing home this thing? She is so mannerless! Okay, I'll surely be waiting for her! (hitting at her box) Shit! Shit! What's happening? Oh... What's up? You startled me! How far? I'm good. How is it going? Yeah... What's with the knife? You brought orange or what? Yeah, I was cooking, so I, err... I wanted to wear the shoes, try them on, because I just bought them... Yeah, so, erm... Right away... What's the update on our guy? He's a dead end! He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, and he doesn't do a one night stand! Yeah, so let's just forget about him! Yeah. I'm hungry, and I'll go check on what I'm cooking. What a fool! She must have taken me for a blind, that I didn't see she has been trying to open this! You're a fool! This girl is so damned! She really meant to outcut me! My people have a proverb that... It is said that when a child knows the secret of death... The father will also find the secret of burial! There you go! You may bring a sledge hammer if you like! Then try opening it again! Let me go see what the idiot is cooking. This is really delicious! Babe... you say this Tunde guy doesn't drink, right? No. Then, spend a couople of nights with him. Are you asking me to sleep with him? You know what... For protection... I'm out of here! Chichi... You have to sleep with him. Yeah. I'm just going to leave this house, and when I'm back, I'm sure you'll feel better. You don't get it, do you, babe? You don't understand... This is like... the biggest fish of our career! Don't you know what the Yoruba call big fish? I don't care! I'm not sleeping with him! What the hell! But I just gave you something for protection! You think I'm not jealous? I'll even break this down for you... Tunde Lewis is a millionaire. Chichi... In dollars. Figure that out. This guy has a gem franchise! That's one of the reasons he is back home, to establish! Projects in one state to another! To expand his business! Tunde's father, Chief Lewis, is a sugar merchant! And his father's father, owns a refinery, come on! We're talking about a generational wealth here That's why his grandson, that motherfucker is benefitting from that shit! And the bank is even willing to loan him money! Then, let's just get the dad! I mean, why do we have to... Why do I have to sleep with this guy? Let's just bait the father. I'm sure that would be easier. You're an idiot! Don't go messing with Tunde's father if you don't want the woman, I mean his wife, to kill you! I mean, she found out a girl got pregnant for her husband about 23 years ago... I don't know what that story is, anyway, but do you know what she did? She got the girl, and had her messed up by thugs! You know what they did? They shaved her pubic har and went away with it! So, don't even go there! Don't! I don't want to sleep with him! I don't! You must sleep with him! I don't want to! Babe, do this for us. You think I'm not jealous? Please, do this for us. How does erm... a million dollar... how does it sound... Asking price... in dollars. Erm... What? I, erm... I gave him my business card... That's what I'm taking about! And you were acting like a novice! Come on! Don't worry. He'll call you. I mean, who wouldn't? I know I don't tell you that you're sexy, but you know you are! Right? My pretty. Don't worry, he'll call you. Alright. And if he doesn't just keep trying. Sexy mama. The talk of a million dollars made you attentive now, right! Listen, do give me that worrisome attitude again, okay. Do you want to talk about it? (exhales) Baba G wants me to sleep with someone else! What? Sleep, as in... Have sex with another man! Is he mad! Exactly! No, no, no, is he going mad, or he's on cheap drugs? What for? It's for a contract! What kind of contract is that? What kind of contract would he be asking you to sleep with a man for? Don't worry about it, you won't understand. Well, it's quite a big sum. I'm not a child, so you can tell me whatever kind of contract that is... You won't understand, so just leave it. I see. I won't understand, right? That would be because I'm a child, and I don't have sense! It's okay. That's fine. But you know I've met a lot of men in my lufe, right? Some are decent, and some are headless chicken running around! This Baba G of yours, is a mad man! Useless... Come on, we aren't fighting here! Hey beautiful. So, erm.. you know who is speaking, right? Yeah. Erm, you want to meet up tonight? Yeah. Okay, that's fine. Alright, see you then. You don't go all the way, do you? I guess. For people I really like. I see you like playing with your drink. Stop trying to read me. I say we should go somewhere very private... All this wining... and dining... is making me feel funny. You look really beautiful to me. Why do you keep playing with your drink? You know you're still going to get down to this! Why waste time? Just stay put. You're dressed already... Yeah. I'm ready to go. You know... I've never felt this way about a woman... At the first meeting. How come you're still single? Long story. I'm going to be busy tonight. But I'd like to see you again. Maybe this time, we'll be... like to be more careful. Right? That's smart. I'd like that. I'd really like that. Let's just cuddle a few minutes, yeah? Okay. Speak. Hey, hold on guy! Just hold it right there! Are you listening to me? Guy, you've got to calm down! Listen to me, right now, I'm reducing your percentage, and that's a fact. I do the work, and all you guys do is sit in the office and look pretty! Do you understand what I'm saying? And right now, I'm working on a very big catch, and I don't have the time for this talk! Fucking nigger! Bloody thief! Everyone is just becoming voracious on the street these days! I really need something here, meen! Fuck! Wow, what a chic this is! I can't let this get past me in this neighbourhood! Look at that ass, goodness! Hi. What's up? Hi. My name is Gabriel. Elizabeth. Nice. Look, mister, aren't you headed anywhere? You've been following me for minutes now! That's because you're worth my time, sweety. Yes, you're worth my time... Do you live in this estate? No. Come on, that's a lie! You can't live elsewhere, and come jog at another estate! Well, except you're looking for attention. Of which, I'm ready to give. I've got plenty hot spots in me... Babe, please let me have your number, and we can do dinner later tonight. Then we see what happens from there, yeah? Thank you, not interested. I'm definitely going to get your phone number... You've got what I like, and I can't let it go... Please babe, let me have your number! Look, I don't give my number to strangers! If you don't give your number, I give mine. I can give you my card. Babe, call me, please. I like you. Nice! I like that. Babe... What? Come on... You can't compare yourself to them! I was just trying to give the girl some direction... Direction to where? To where she is jogging to or where she is jogging from, which is it? I thought as much! I only got caught by your ass, and I give a damn about anything else! (beeping) What's happening here... (beeping continues) Come on, Chichi! What is it? It hasn't gotten this bad, come on! Are you just going to walk out like that? I've had enough of your disrespect! Here, this is your camera! And let me have my cut when you're done! Get lost! Bloody loser! I don't care a hoot! Yeah, let's get down to business! Let's see... Where's the video... Chichi! Chichi!!! Come down! What is it? Come on, get down right now! Leave me alone, there's no need to beg me! There's no going back for me! Who is begging you? Chchi... what makes you think I'm begging you? I say, come the fuck, down and give me this video! Which video? The video you said you made, of course! See? Where is it? Let me... Where is it? Where is the card? It looks like you're insane! I don't understand! I made the video, and it was here! I... I... What Chichi... You want to start acting for me? You're acting for an actor, Chichi! Don't even think about it! So, this is your plan, right? This is what you want to do? You want to play a fast one on me? I'm the master of this game! How dare you, stupid! So, this is your plan... you want to go behind me to start asking for silly, cheap money! Baba G... Yes? Don't insult me! Chichi... You've fallen in love! Goodness! The card is missing. I can't find it! It's not here, and it's not in my car! You can check! Get me that fucking vide, and if you can't, make another! No, I'm not going to make you another tape! I'll break your head open! I'm done with this, and I'm done with you! I'll destroy you right now if you... My friend, get... You think I'm fucking joking with you... (knocking at door) Who is that? Babe! How are you? I'm fine. Do you mind if I spend a few nights with you, please? Is everything alright? It's a long story! Okay, sure, please come in. Let me help with that. Thank you. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. What's up, bro? Somebody is definitely after me! And in this case, I'll really hate to waste a premium assassin. A lady. So, what really happened? Well, day one in the country... The parents decided to have lunch at White River Restaurant And then, this chic walked in... You need to see this girl, bro! She is damned gorgeous! Just the way you like it... Just the way I like it. She sat somewhere, crossed, looiking at me... Literally throwing her legs ope and giving me the gree light. I invited her over one more time, and she showed up. Talking dirty and looking like a... Or looking like Naomi Campbell in her early days, men! Irresistible. Absolutely. So, I moved in and went over to her apartment. Then I put it down on her, bro! I did overtime, trust me! When I was done, she was in the bathroom... I got up to... and being a hunter that I am, I started looking around the room to see if anything was amiss. Boom, there was a tape! There was a camera showing the recording of everything we've done, without my consent. Without your consent? Well, the act was with my consent, but the taping wasn't. That's the whole point. So, what do you want me to do? I need you to follow her for a while. Figure out if she is working alone... Or she has gotten a party with her. I thought, maybe I'm going to call her up at some point, you understand, hit her up. But I don't want to jump into conclusions. I was like, maybe this one is a proper freak. Then, if I call her up, she might tell me something like, big head, I forgot my tape, give it back to me... But I didn't get that call, and that's what is worrying at this point. Wow! Did you call her? Of course, I did. Have you forgotten who you're dealing with? ... Alright, so make this move, Follow her for a while. Fine out what she knows. Who she is hanging out with, and let me know about it. Great, consider it done. You want some? Yes, I do. Meen, get out of my car. You're too greedy... Let me have some. Take the whole thing and get out of my car. Thanks bro. I'll get back to you. Cheap, motherfucker! (phone vibrating) (phone still vibrating) (phone continues to vibrate) Speak. Really? Okay. How many? Same place, same time, right? Nice one, bro. I'll call back, definitely. Sweetheart... Yes? I need to... go home. It's almost 4.0clock, and my wife would be back. You're married? Not like married, really... It's baby mama, kind of. Babe, are you serious right now? Really? Baba G, why are you so callous? So, you followed me for days just to get into my pant! Err... Wait, I'm not done talking! You didn't even have the decency to be honest with me! Chill now! Calm down! What's your problem? Come on, take it easy. What's with the attitude? We've been down there already, so come off it. See, let me tell you this... Something is coming up, babe... Calm down. I'll give you 300k, but err... that's if you're down with the business I see. I'm down. You're smart. Let me just drop you off, and... Sir, based on the requirement and goals for next year, we have projected figures for 2020/2021... Hello babe. Sorry, do I know you? Could you, please, help me drop this for chief? Erm... why can't you drop it yourself? Don't worry, I'll sort you out. I'll make it worth your while, okay. If you drop this for me, there's some cash in it just for you. Okay? Oh, okay, thanks. How are you, Mr. Bola? Please, help me pass this envelope to the boss. Ensure he gets it, please! I'll see you later. (prayer ongoing) We have come up with projected figures for 2020... I'll send her downstairs. Err, Eva, could you, please, go downstairs to pick up a delivery. Alright, sure. (prayer continues) This is an emergency! (prayer continues) We're expecting a growth rate of 22.5%... Which is for... Sorry, is this net gross, growth figure you're quoting, as it would have a different impact on my department? Sure, this is actually based on the gross figures. Okay, thank you. Could you send me a copy of this slide as soon as we're done? Yes, sure. Can I have the copy as well? Of course, I'll send it. Erm... I'm afraid we have to adjourn this meeting again! Thank you very much for coming, and I'll see you guys some other time. I really have to run now! Thank you... (prayer ongoing) Excuse me! This prayer has to stop, I need to leave right now! I'm so sorry, please! What's the matter? Madam? (phone ringing) Hello... So, you're the one! 10 Million? Where am I supposed to get 10 Million from? Are you serious? 10 Million? Hello... (hailing friend) Listen, we need to see. Yeah... erm... let's meet at Crossway. Yeah I'm on the move. Okay. Chichi, please, help me look at this dress, is it neat? I think it's nice, but does it match my skin colour, or does it look good on me? I just want to... Are you not going to the movies? Yes, but, I think he is going to propose! ... I know! Really, I do! Of course, we always know... In fact, go get dresssed so you can help do a video recording of the whole thing! I'm busy. Why? I'm busy! Haba Chichi, you haven't even stepped out since you moved in here! Are you alright? I'm fine. Are you sure you don't want to talk about what Baba G did to you? Just so you can move forward! Okay, maybe when you come back from the movies and engagement... Please, don't go embarrass me in public, so you need to cool down. You're expecting too much, you know! See the way you're dressed to go and see movies! Because it's an engagement! And for this engagement, I can embarrass my dad! Yeah! Wow! Okay. Hello Hi. I have a few questions for you... I'm not answering any without you giving me the card! Well, I destroyed it. How much is it worth to you? It doesn't matter. Of course, it doesn't. I thought we had something... It was all a game. I don't feel anything for you. Really? I really don't believe that. Like I said, Who do you work for? How many of you is on this deal? ... Tunde, my guy! Please excuse us, he's my friend, and we'll only take a few minutes. Do I know you? Well, you'll soon know. How did you get to me? (laughing) He's asking me questions! Really? Tunde, I won't work away if I were you! Tunde Lewis, let's have this chat real quick before you go in for your second leg... Do you understand what I'm saying? Tunde is poking finger at me! Really? I guess you found that camera and memory card. ... (laughing) This is funny. You actually want me to believe you planted that camera for me to find, right? This is me saying, I'm calling your bluff! Get out of here before I... You really think God loves you that much? So, he'd be showing you things, right? You've got to calm down, okay? Why, do you think she destroyed the memory card yesterday? That's because we've got copies! You get my point? I can have you arrested, okay? Just showing up here... Dude, any wrong move from now, my team and I will start releasing information you don't want people to see! Don't dare me, Tunde! Do you understand me? 1 million dollar is my asking price! Do you understand? We sort that out, and if you don't, we'll start with your fiance! I'll make sure I break you guys apart! Then get into your family and mess them up! We go public with those videos you don't want people to see! You get it? Your name, gem franchise... everything! You don't have a stand in ths country, bro! You can get on with your game, no problem. Don't you understand? See, wait a moment... This is my game! Take it from me! Listen... I'm telling you that girl is a fool! Don't you understand? Okay, this is the deal... I promised to give her that, you know... 40% of everything, but right now... I'm so upset, and I'm not giving her a dime again! I'm the one who makes everything happen! That's Baba G's level, you know! I'm giving you the fact! Listen... Let me give you some insight... By the time I'm done... By the time I'm done with this girl called Chichi... I swear, she's going to spend a long time behind the bars! You don't understand what I'm saying? I'm being real with you! I'm going to fuck her up big time! 1 million dollar! I'm rich, men! We're talking 1, heaven million dollar, here! Oh my world! Shit men! To hell with her! To hell with her!! I'm made! Hey baby. Tunde... Yes? You bastard! Tunde, how could you do this to me? How could you do this to me after all I've done for you? How could you, Tunde? We're barely two weeks here, and you're sleeping around! ... Hey, don't do that! Okay, let go of my shirt... Dad must hear this, Tunde! Can you just get a hold of yourself! You're cheating... Alright, you need to get a hold of yourself! Calm down! Tunde... I'm going to let go of you now, okay! You've got to behave yourself, okay! I'm going to let you go now... Tunde, where did you go... two days ago? Tell me! I went for a meeting. You knew about it. With who? An old friend of mine. You cheap liar! These are pictures of you and her! From the moment we entered the restaurant, Today! Oh, no wonder you insisted on meeting your parents! Because you wanted to meet her, right? Right? Tunde, I'm done with you! Listen... You have to move out of the room! These are just pictures! Just pictures? They are just pictures! It means nothing! They are pictures... Okay, we were together, but she is just an old friend from school! Oh really? We were just hanging out You and I are an item, so don't let this get to you! These pictures, Tunde... have you slept with this woman in this short time we've been here? No. You're just a cheap liar! I'm done with you! You have to leave this room! You're overreacting... Whatever! You're overreacting... Whatever, Tunde! Okay, let me keep my gear, and we'll come back to talk about it. Why did you call me? We need to talk. I don't need to talk to you. Where are the copies from the memory card? There are no copies. Your partner came to me face-to-face! He sent pictures of us from the first time I met you... to the last time! Damn, you're really good! You're good, you know that! Very detailed. Listen, Tunde... There are no copies, trust me. Well, I can't take any risk, anymore. When can I see you? Gabriel? Gabriel? (banging at the door) Gabriel, open this door right now! Gabriel, I know you're in there! Gabriel, if you don't want your neighbours knowing your business, open this door now! (kicking at the door) Gabriel... Well they say if the mountain doesn't go to Muhammed, he would go to the mountain! What's the problem? Stay away from Tunde and I! So, you've decided to be unfortunate? Chichi, I thought you knew about this game! I thought you understood perfectly! And you have done it again! You're in love? Screw you! Heed my warning and stay away from us! Gabriel... Are you a fool or... Did you say, us? Did you, freaking, say, us? Gabriel! Are you... are you stupid? This is the kind of rubbish you were doing in SA! Ruining things up and down! Acting like some crazy, ass bitch! You, freaking, fell in love with him! And that got us fucked up! And we had to relocate down to Nigeria! Okay, take, for instance... Tell me now... If anything goes wrong... say something goes down the side, where do we run? Chichi, where do we run? Now, note this warning, and let it register in your head! Chichi... I, Gabby... Baba G... I'm not running anywhere for anybody again! Yeah. So, if you know what's good for you... Do you understand what I'm saying? Heed your own warning! Okay, heed your own warning! Stay away! Stay away from my mark! Do you understand? Heed your own warning, and stay away from my mark! Because that's my mark! Tunde Lewis is my mark! If it weren't for me, you wouldn't even meet him in the first place! So, what are you saying? So, I'm telling for a fact, that you should take your own warning! If you don't want me to change many things in your life,.. Shit! And when I blow up... Are you feeling me? When Baba G blows, the fuck, up, don't come running to me! Don't come running to me with your, fucking tail, behind your two legs! Now, get the fuck out of my house! Bounce! Baba G... You've got something to say? I've given you everything you need to know for your own good, so I've got nothing to say to you again! Get the fuck out! Fuck you! Screw you! I'll kill you! Olatunde... Yes, dad? How is the search for the location coming along We have a few choices. Very good. I'm glad to hear that. Have you found any good location yet? Yes, we've narrowed down option. I believe that UK would be the choice. Okay. (clears throat) Thank you. Very good. Anyway, Olatunde, that's not why we asked to see you. Apparently. Yeah. What's this thing about caling off the engagement? I suppose Hilda reached you. She called, of course. She almost cried her eyes out! That's right. When did she leave? Tunde, you should have come to us! We know you love her, and we would have made her stay. Despite the fact that we both know you don't like her? Who said that I don't like her? She is pretty, of course! Mom? Yes! You were going to call an agent to help get her ticket to leave the next day! Okay, well... I don't like her, that's the truth! Come on, what kind of spoilt brat is that! Very uncultured! Very disrespectful! Yes, let's not forget that she is also snobbish! That's right! Em... (clears throat) Olatunde... Sir? What does the girl's father really do? I mean, what does he do for a living? Hmmm, what he doesn't do is the question. He's erm... he's big. He's as big as they come. He's got the biggest construction company and real estate in Cameroon. He's got a franchise... commodity frachice, the biggest actually. He owns airlines... He owns stuff... He has a shipping company... He is easily the second richest man in Cameroon. Really? Is that why she is so spoilt? I see! What do you see, dad? I... I... wee, but still, she is very spoilt! Okay, so that's good riddance! What? I say good riddance, dad. Em... Okay... moving forward now... We're moving forward, of course. Olatunde... I'll get you a very good wife. Look, your mother is very good at match-making! My friend's daughter, despite the fact that she is a lawyer she is also a very good cook! She'll make a good wife for you! Trust me! Olatunde, she isn't good for you! I mean... the friend's daughter isn't good for you! Don't agree to that because she isn't good for you! Dad doesn't seem to agree... No, she isn't good for him! What? Come on, you know the family! You know them well enough, and you know that girl is good! Moving forward... I think what I need to do is just focus on my life now. I'll concentrate on my business, and that can transit into marriage, instead of jumping the gun. Business! Later I could... Yeah! You don't like that, right? No problem. If your father won't support me, instead of disqualifying me, we should work something out! Tunde's mother, come on, stop it! Let the boy make his own choice, just like I found you! Yes. Of course, I found you! Yes, but... Hold on! Come on, hold on, Tunde's mother! Come, this is not Eddie Murphy's kind of... Coming to America stuff! It doesn't work like that anymore. No, it doesn't! It's business! Really? Yes! Eat. There you go. About that land, what we need to do is to, first of all, find partners that will... Yes, that's where I was coming to, business! Strictly business... Why are you massaging my leg? I'm not giving you any money! Bad girl! You so like money! I'm not giving you any money! Please! Okay, beg me. Please... Beg me here... You're so wrapped up wth money! Have it. Thank you! Look at you! That's all you'rre good at! What's the meaning of this? Have I ever given you lesser than expected before? There's always a first time for everything. Silly girl. Make sure you take care of my baby, and not use all the money to show off, please! Why do you always come here during school hours? You've never brought my child here, and that's because of your naugghtiness! That's why you always sneak down here when he's in school! I'll definitely do you right... Come on, stop! What's that? You think I'm Hadiza, right? Stop! Hadi... You spoke to Hadiza? What for? Don't I have better things to do? But you just mentioned her name! Do you know Hadiza? You better not make me a case for your gossip! What's wrong with you... Move closer here... (knocking at the door) Is that Chichi? Chi... no, it's not. I'm not sure. Go and open the door Hold on... Actually, I... Calm down, babe! Yetunde... I'm going! Yetun... So, what are you doing now? I'll let the person in... Let who in? Come on, sit! Sit down, first! (knocking continues) Come on sit! No, I'm leaving! Come on! (knocking again) Hold on babe, what's today's date? Is it Thursday or Wednesday? Thursday. Shit men! Why didn't this girl tell me she'd be cpomeing today? Which girl? Use the back! Come on, use the back! Why? Baba G, so Hadiza is moving in! Hadiza that took your child to Abeokuta and abandoned him there so she could come back and do runs all over Lagos is the one moving in, right? I, Yetunde, who was coming all the way from the mainland to come and give you money for transportation to school... Baba G... What's with all this super story now? You're wicked! Me? Yes! But the house you wanted, I got it for you, didn't I? So, what's your problem? Babe, use the back door. I, Yetunde? Never! I'm a street girl... Never! I will not! Leave me alone! Open this door! ... Come on, calm down! Go use the back door! (banging at door) Babe... I don't have issues with you... It's this... Will you... Hadiza please... Come on, Yetunde... Let me beat this girl! Wait... Come on, what's all this crap... of a civil war in here! What's all this rubbish? I want to beat you today! Who do you want to beat? Me? I'll beat you! I said use the back door... I will not! I won't! Babe... I won't! Take this thing away from this place, please! Babe, use the back door... Come on, Hadiza... (jeering) Of course, I know you've got it and I feel it... What can you do? You can't do a thing! Babe, go and use the back door now! What do you want to turn this place into? Croos over like a monkey that you are! Spare me, please! Ugly thing! Sugarcane! Your family is cursed! Come on, stop!!! Leave me alone! Is this how we're going to live? Come on, excuse me! Is this how we're going to live? (hisses) You're supposed to be here on Thursday, this is Wednesday! Don't you know days of the week again? Good for you, calculator! Thursday or Wednesday, it's all the same! I'm hungry, I want to eat, please! Take my bag upstairs! Fool! What... Hello, I'm here to pick some of my things. (laughing) Please, is there food? I feel like eating pounded yam, please! Coming... Please. Why do you keep calling me? Why do you keep meeting me? Now, with you colleague, call it bluff or not... They disrespected me! I don't play that game. I invented it! So, I'll want you out of here when I start playing my game! Would like something to eat? After an explanation, maybe. Well, few years ago, this would have gone South! For sure! It would have turned out really bad for all of you! Be that as it may, I'm not on the straight and narrow now. I don't play that anymore. I'm on the right side of the law, so to speak. What are you saying? I don't understand... what you mean? What are you saying? I'm saying you guys, employ some prety old fashion methods. And if I were to be a target, then that means you guys usually deal with small time targets! I don't believe this! You're a con guy too? I used to be. The best. I'm on the straight and narrow now. I don't do that anymore. Now, would you like something to eat? No, not at all! After everything you just told me? What if the food is drugged? I don't trust you! I think... I don't think I can take anything again! Stop being paranoid. The food is coming straight from the kitchen How can I, possibly, orchestrate that from here? Now, I'm pretty sure I don't want to eat anything. Suit yourself. Listen... Your fiancee is gone? Yeah, all thanks to you and your team. What team? Listen, I had nothing to do with it this time. I left the team after... After we had sex. I went back and tried to get my things and leave, but then... We found out the tape was missing. Call a potato anyway you like, it's still same thing! You know what this means, don't you? Your boss will be coming for you as well! Listen... It doesn't have to be that way. Why didn't I think of this? Hmmm He intends to play Tunde Lewis... and the con artist at the same time! He was going to use you to break my mom's heart! (laughing) Why are you joking about this? Now you sound just like Baba G! Don't you care? You should stay away from me! For what? You need, saving, darling. I want to help you. Get you off the street. Make your goal legal, for once. You can't be serious! But I'm dead serious! Yes, I do. I do want to go leagal, and leave this life that I'm living right now. I've been thinking about it of recent, but... I just... What you need, my dear, is a tutor. A teacher, if you will. One with experience. I've done that, big time. I could teach you the whole mistakes and how to avoid them. That would mean we have to spend a lot of time together. What's wrong with that? I'm not looking for love... But that's when you find it, baby! Nobody ever finds it, looking for it! You find it when you're not looking. I promise. So... on a different slide... I intend to deal with your former boss. I'll put him through a one-on-one... on how this game is played! Do you play Tennis, by any chance? Now, you sound like my dad. He loved Tennis. Well, that makes two of us. So, I want you to join me for a game of Tennis. In the middle of it, I'll figure out how to deal with your little, tyrant boss! Okay? That was tiring. ... Just saw that he's... Okay, that's a little aggressive, but... worth it. Just so, it's more convincing. Okay, that is a little aggressive, but it works. You know what? Why don't we go check if he still watching. No, not at all! Not a good idea, babe. You know... he's still watching... he might still be watching, so we need to, you know, play ti innocently like everything is fine. Got you. Yeah? Yeah. (phone vibrating) Phone call... Oh, okay. Hello Oh, okay. Alright, thank you. Errrm, he just left. So, this game, officially, just started! So, wait, erm... tell me... What exactly do you want? I want the name and contact of the biggest deal you guys had this year. Including the banker you dealth with. I think he's the main man who can make all this go away. Okay, got you. My girl. Let's go, or you want another game? No, I'm tired. (camera clicking) You know I've been telling you this for a while! I've been saying this for quite a long time, guy! I can't be busting my ass off everyday on the field, and you'd be asking me to give you 40% of earnings! Am I mad or what? Look, but it is my contact! It is my contact! If I don't get you that contact, how would you have made the money? Look, I'm the seed of this operation! So, it's either you make me happy, or... Or what? You must really think I'm playing around here! I say, or what? What's wrong with you? What can you do? Have you forgotten you work in a bank? If you aren't careful, I'll blow the lid on you! I don't care about a damn thing! I'm a gentleman with no hassles, but I can mess you up! I'll take away your livelihood and throw it away! You better be smart! You want me to go report you at the bank? Come on, tell me if I should just walk into the bank and tell them what you've been up to... So, what's your problem? Come on, be smart! Baba G, look, I thought you... were okay with the percentage when did the agreement! That's because... okay, do you know the amount of work that goes into this? Now that I know the volume of work that goes into this, I became more aware! Don't you understand me? Look here guy, this is the pattern... I'm a gentleman and I don't like trouble, so I can only give you 20% 20 what? Take it or leave it, that's what I'm ofering! That money is too small! Come on, G. I'm your guy... You must be stupid, I believe! I'm telling you I go through a lot to get things done, and you're... When I give you the 20%, you may decide not to take it! What's all that! You better agree to the 20%, and you'll be fine! For today, this is it, so far. ... It's enough. Pick him up. Hello Hey... before you hang up... I have a business proposal for you... Can we meet? Into the van! Immediately! Get into the van now! Move in there! Move in! (knocking at door) (knocking continues) Enter! Boss, here is, delivered. Sit. Sit down. I apologise for the inconveniences. But it was important we meet like this. What... what exactly do you want from me? Hi. Okay, I guess it's straight to business, then. How would you like to be free of Baba G? Who are you, guys? Who are you? I'm Baba G's former partner. We never got to meet up. Of course, Baba G made sure of that. But I saw you once, in his car. We had a falling out recently, and Baba G has been a pain! And from the recent meeting you had with him, I'm sure he has been a pain to you too. Right? I don't know who you're talking about, really... Are you the police? No. Okay... Let's calm down. Now, this is between the both of us... Okay? You're the one in talking terms with Baba G, I'm not. So, I can't attack him. I can't even go close to him. At least, both of you are still on talking terms, arent you? So, whatever plans we come up with, you'll have to be very discreet! Baba G is suspicious of everything and everyone around him. So, you muct act... Natural. Okay? Has Baba G been a pain to you too? So, what do you want me to do for you now? Now, we're talking. Open the bag, babe! Come on, be fast with it! (screaming) I'm taking my enemies to the psychiatric hospiatl at Yaba! My dear... Oh, wait!!! Calm down, first. (screams) Easy! You better not die inside this car, please! What? Come over here, my dear... Let go of me, please! Come on... Leave me! (super excited) Baba G... Yes? This is the money! Wait a moment. Let me set you up... There you are, and go enjoy yourself. Baba G... Yes, babe? Wait! Come on... Wait a moment!!! What is it? What's wrong wth you? So, this is all I get, right? From all that money? Did we agree on anything else? I agreed to this before I knew the kind of money and risk involved! What silly risk did you find? I've been on the street for ages, and my deal is my deal! Babe, better be cool with that money. So, take your mind off anything else! Okay, so... Do I look like a fool to you? So what? When is the next job? (laughing) Even God loves some people more than others! What's your problem? Babe, don't you know babies crawl before walking? Then you walk before you run! Do you feel that flow? You can now ask when the next job is, right? I'm not joking here, please! You stressed me getting your number, and now you're holding something close to 500k. All of a sudden, you're now done for whatever! Come on, get out of my car! I'm traveling tonight. (overlapping bit) When are you coming back? Don't ask me silly questions, please! Don't worry, I'll call you. (knock at door) Err... I'm coming... Hadiza? One second, I'm coming... Why is this door locked? Sorry. What's up with you? WHere have you been? I feel so tired. Sorry. You're tired, right? I'm so tired. Should I get you something to drink? God bless you. Okay, so I brought you your baby... Oh yeah... And your drink. There you go. Drink something, first. This is too much! You want to kill me? Really good! (laughing) Why are you still awake? You should be sleeping by now. I was waiting for you. Come on, drink more. What the hell are ou doing here? The last time I checked, I still have 3 months of my rent, left! Doon't worry, by tomorrow, I'll come get the rest of my stuff, and will be out of your fucked up life! Go get your stuff and get the hell out of here! Don't listen to her. Come, let me ease you of your stress. What do you say? I... I have something really special for you upstairs. If you want it, I' ready when you are... I'm right behind you! I'll just finish up with this, and I'll join you. Damn, that's something! (phone vibrating) (phone still vibrating) Hadiza... Hadiza! Chichi... Chichi!!! The number you're trying to reach is switched off, please try again later. Hadiza!!! (screams) Where's my car key? I'm going to kill somebody today! Where's my fucking car key! Shit!!! (screaming) Chichi! Hello Hello... This is the EFCC Mr. Gabriel, can you, please, step out of the vehicle? We have a warrant for your arrest. I have a confession to make. Oh, you do now. My, erm... My real name is... is Chinyere. (laughs) Oh well, I think I'll beat you to the point on that one. I, kind of, figured that part out already. Yes. Wow, I'm so happy! Can you imagine! Baba G is just an anchor in all of this! That's right. Hadiza! Hadiza totally shocked me! I wasn't expecting her to do so well, ,and then she got him arrested! So, he doesn't come after me, nor does he go after her! We're both free! I just feel like a huge load has been lifted off my shoulders, halleluyah! Come, celebrate with me! No, baby... Come on! Come sit with me for a second. I think... you need to stop drinking. I'm not drunk... Err, you've had a little too much to drink. You know... I could be really bad when I'm tipsy... No, I have no doubt about that. What you need to do is lie down, and wait for daddy. I'll come tuck you in, okay. You need to sleep this drink off. Let me finish sending this text, quickly. What are you doing up? Tell me about your old life. I want to know. How much was your biggest score? 7.8 million dollar. Wow! Yeah. It happened between 3 governors in 3 states in the East. Wow! How... how did you pull that off? I needed connections, and they were connected to connections. Basically, I had to be involved in big circles. I'm talking... social clubs, golf clubs, polo clubs... Multiple associations as well. Yeah. Especially, politicians. You will not believe the kind of greed that drives those guys! It was almost a pleasure hitting them! I could live in that life, my goodness! So, tell me, are you on the run? Are they looking for you? No, not at all. Are you a criminal? Erm... I'm a criminal, yes, but... (laughs) The heat was enormous the first time. I had to get out of town. Took off to cameroon. Spent about 10 years over there. Within that time, most of the people after me, either lost their positions of power, namely the governors... And then, then main guy just died. His name is, erm, Chief Benson. Yeah. Chief Benson? Yeah. Yeah, Chief Benson Okafor was the pivotal force. He was the one I got connected to first, then he introduced me to three governors. And through the governors, I made my move, and I couldn't believe my lucky break. I think that set the pat of my life, really. Chief Benson Okafor knew you? Yes. Do you know him? What are you doing? It was you! Calm down! Come on, calm down! Get a hold of yourself! Chichi... Are you sure we're talking about the same man? You killed him! He passed in prison! It drove him crazy in 2014... Shortly after, my mom couldn't take it. She passed on too. I was... I was all alone. Nobody would help me! Not even my relatives! I had to drop out of school. You... Tunde... You destroyed us! You destroyed me! Because of you, I married this life of crime! Chichi... I know what I did was... was just pure evil to your family... I tale full responsibility for it. I don't know what to say, other than I'm sorry... I'm so sorry from the bottom of my heart. But, this life... decisions, choices that you made in your life... That was you. That wasn't... I didn't take those decisions for you. You set up... yourself from the start! Chichi... Fuck... off! Chichi... Don't you... I never want to see you again! Chichi! What are you doing here? Who let you in? How did my secretary let you in? I see you put the money to good use. You've got a thriving business. You learned. You look great. I'm proud of you. I miss you. I miss you so much! I did everything I could... to stop thinking about you... I traveled... Went far away from you as much as I could... I even met many people. But it was like... Like you're wild in my DNA, or something... I couldn't stop thinking about you. Searched very nook and crany, and I love you, Chinyere. ... Everybody I met... That's just the twist of fate, and... I was the hand that brought you so much pain. Yet, you're the one I know I love most. I don't know what to do.
