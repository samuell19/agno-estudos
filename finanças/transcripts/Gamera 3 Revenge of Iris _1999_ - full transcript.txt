1999 THE EQUATOR Her son and grandson were eaten. Were there any more birds like this one? OFF OKINOTORI ISLAND, JAPAN'S SOUTHERNMOST POINT THE UNMANNED SUBMERSIBLE "KAIKO" Winch ahead slow! Set to low tension! Is the sea bottom this bumpy? Maybe it's a problem of scale, like we're too close or something? - Can you pull back a bit? - Roger. - There's not enough light. - Increase sensitivity. Is that...? - Gamera? - Impossible. Look at the number of them! So those aren't boats... Then what? Dead Gameras. GAMERA 3: REVENGE OF IRIS We interrupt this program for a special bulletin. A monster has appeared in Fukuoka Harbor. The Self-Defense Forces... The monster is believed to be in the Inland Sea. A warning has been issued to ships in the area. The government is calling the sea monster Gamera and the flying monsters Gyaos... Do not venture outside after dark. Be especially careful of attacks by Gyaos on wide roadways. The cabinet decided this morning to meet Gyaos with all possible force. The basis of the strategy is to shoot them down as they appear. This could make the port area a battleground... TOKYO There's still time. The monster won't come this far. Look out for stray bullets, though. It'll be like Bosnia around here. I'm sorry, we'd all be safe in Matsudo if not for me. And my job. Wait here. I'll get your mother. Iris! Iris! Come on. We're not going to the vet. About what we were talking about Iast night... Do I really have to change my family name? This is a very old village where you're living... I don't want to. If our name's not good enough, why's she living here? Stop it, Ma! She used to be so sweet. MINAMI-ASUKA, NARA PREFECTURE Hirasaka! We'll see you after school! That girl... She used to come here in the summer. - I bet you liked her. - Don't be stupid! They say her parents died. Some kind of accident. YASHIMA MARINE INSURANCE CO., LTD. MITO ASAKURA, CABINET SECRETARY I've been asked to help you. - This is Shinya Kurata. Have you met? - Of course not. Sorry, no... You wished to ask about the curved jewels we collected? Could we see them? Since three years ago, during the Legion attack, when Gamera reappeared in Sendai, they've all decayed. Not one remains in its original shape. - Where's Mr. Kusanagi who found them? - In Washington. - And the girl? - You mean Asagi? She came to see these before she went abroad to study. But why do you ask? So Earth and Heaven won't be destroyed. Eh? "When Heaven and Earth are opposed, the result is destruction. "All appears calm, but danger lies before." It's from The Book of Changes, one of the Chinese CIassics. "RYU-SEI-CHO" The legend says that the Ryuseicho sleeps in here. What's the Ryuseicho? - I don't know. - A monster, maybe? Wouldn't it be great if it was true? There's a stone that seals it in. Go get it. And then you'll leave us alone? What do you mean? I know you've been picking on my brother. Stop it. We might overlook some things. - What are you guys doing? - Damn! It's Moribe! Go and help your Tokyo girlfriend. Mr. Big Old House! You've got a big mouth. Remember that. Hirasaka? Where'd they go? They took off. But what's that? Why is it so heavy? You carried this by yourself? - It's none of your business. - It is so! Anyway, we've got to put it back. Miyuki, stay there! My family are the guardians of the Ryuseicho. - This shouldn't be moved. - That's just a Iegend, isn't it? Hirasaka, let's go. And don't tell anyone. Ryuseicho? What's in that old shrine? That land belongs to the Moribe family. It's probably some old ruins. My university wanted to dig in there, but Old Woman Moribe said no. - So nobody knows? - Not exactly. TAKAMATSU TUMULUS, NARA The moon takes twenty-eight days to circle the Earth, so the ancient Chinese divided the heavens into twenty-eight houses. Seven in each quadrant. Ryu, Sei and Cho... Three of the houses are in the constellation Hydra, the water snake. "Ryu" is the head. "Sei" is a red star, and red is the color of the Guardian of the South. In the Takamatsu Tumulus near here, a dragon guards the East, a tiger guards the West and a tortoise the North. There's no South. That wall had fallen in. Maybe it was a phoenix. - A phoenix? - A crimson phoenix. Like a firebird. So it was a bird. The professors at my school think that's what "Ryuseicho" means. The Guardians of South and North, are they enemies? The Guardian of the South defends against an enemy from the South. From the South... You have three messages. It's Sakurai. About those samples you sent last week, they're different enough from our Gyaos that they could be a subspecies, or a local Variation, maybe? See you. SHlNYA KURATA - It's your mother. Where've you been? - Kyoto? It was your father's birthday yesterday. He was hoping that you'd perhaps call. Give us a call when you can. Ms. Nagamine, it's Kobayashi. The Monster Damage Control Committee is meeting September 7th at 7:00pm. We'll be discussing the Gamera fossils discovered off Okinotori lsland, and we'd like to hear your report. Please call me about the agenda. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 3:00PM This means the Gyaos are evolving at tremendous speed. I agree. - That's scary. - Who knows what could happen? Mr. Osako? No, I'm not. I'm sorry, you look like someone I know. That's alright... Away you go, then. I'll have this, please. You aren't the man, but the thought of seeing him was a happy one. Bye. AIR DEFENSE COMMAND Unknown intruder moving too fast to catch. Roger. Maintain position until further orders. OVER TOKYO BAY, 3:05 PM You're Hirasaka's brother, right? Did you see Gamera too? No, I didn't. I was at my grandma's in Matsudo. Your sister saw him? She'd had her appendix out, and my mom was with her, and that morning my dad... Satoru! Shut up. Mind your own business. Come on. Listen... If it weren't for Gamera, the Gyaos might've killed us all. The whole world would be the Legion's nest. Gamera is our friend, you know. Would you say that if he'd crushed your house and your parents? ORNITHOLOGY DEPT. Ms. MAYUMI NAGAMINE 6:50 PM It's been a while... Yeah. MONSTER-DAMAGE CONTROL COMMITTEE THIRD EMERGENCY SESSION Which monster are we discussing today? There's no specific one. Why is Japan continually being attacked by monsters? And what can we do to stop it? That's what we're here to discuss. I seem to have become the Ministry's resident monster expert. - Ms. Nagamine? - Yes? How do you do? Thank you for coming. Look at this graph. Our analysts say it indicates a rapid increase in incursions into our air space. What do you think? There's no connection with hostile action by neighboring countries. Let us know what you think, please. Mito Asakura... Who is she? It seems that she's the government's chief fortune teller. A word to the wise, you'd be smart not to be too curious about her. SHIBUYA DISTRICT, TOKYO, 7:30 PM To hell with all of you! Osako! Who needs your bitching or your old stories? Look who's talking! - What a waste! - Those... ...are Gyaos. What are they doing here? What's that? Mom! Fireworks! You're really a talent scout? Look... something's falling. You just want to get me back to your office, don't you? Don't be so suspicious! If analysis of this creature could lead to measures against the Gyaos... Excuse me! Tatsuya! What the hell? Tatsuya! Run! Tatsuya... Gamera saved me! Gamera saved me! Ayana! Come quick! This is the scene in Shibuya. The tragedy comes on Friday night, with the area at its busiest. There's no official announcement yet, but eyewitness accounts suggest that the large creature which fell over Yoyogi Park was a Gyaos, with Gamera causing great damage in the Shibuya area. This footage shows what seems to be Gamera leaving Shibuya. This video, shot by an office worker from Setagaya Ward, shows the monster thought to be Gamera... Gamera? Estimates of the dead and injured range from 15,000 to 20,000, although the true figure remains unknown. The Fire Department and Self-Defense Forces continue rescue operations as chaos grips Shibuya, jammed with people seeking missing relatives and friends and crowds of curious onlookers. The Chief Cabinet Secretary, at a press conference yesterday, announced an emergency cabinet meeting and said Prime Minister Nagahama would inspect the damage in Shibuya this morning. Why did Grandma want to see my brother? He's got to take over the family. - Can't a girl do that? - Of course not! The Moribe family has always had the task of guarding the Ryuseicho. The next person that this task falls to will be you. But what is the Ryuseicho? When I was about your age, I was told it brings disaster. They say, if it comes back to life, it will destroy the world. But as long as that stone isn't moved, nothing will happen. A sumo wrestler tried to move it about 150 years ago. He tried and tried, and he couldn't even budge it! When you succeed to the head of this house, keep the Ten-lnch Dagger with you. With it, you seal in the Ryuseicho. Stop! You'll scare him! So it's hatched. Do you know what that is? Iris... I named him... Iris. I'm going to raise him. And then... he'll take revenge for me. It's a beta version. The test version of a computer game. Who's got time for games? It simulates planetary environment and civilization. Now games can predict business sales or even environmental impacts. Push this button. You can design an environment that would prevent a Gyaos, if you left out Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and the Gulf War. - Can you quantify all that? - That's what Mana does. - Mana? - It's a simulation parameter. Its value was extremely low around Japan in 1995. And so the Gyaos appeared? It's low now, as well. Have you heard of this man called Kurata? Yeah, he's a game designer. I've seen him in magazines. His first game was a big hit, statistical analysis and storms. By the end, he was rumored to be doing government work. - "By the end"? - He seems to have vanished. This morning, the Cabinet mobilized the Self-Defense Forces to eliminate Gamera. You really intend to raise him? If I don't, he'll die. - He's not what you think he is. - How do you know what I think he is? What if he grows up and eats you? - Don't worry. - Why not? - I understand him. - How can you understand him? Because I do. We're both alike. We both hate Gamera. Gamera killed his family, too. Aren't you hungry, Iris? Where's your mouth? Maybe it's not open yet. Dogs and cats take a while to open their eyes. The Maritime Defense Force attacked Gamera off Okinotori Island early today. It is not known at this time if Gamera was hit. Gamera evaded pursuit and is thought to have escaped into the open sea. Sure we should go after him. We can't leave everything to the US. We should fight our own battles. I'm scared to even go outside! You never know when he'll come. I'd like him dealt with right away. I was in Fukuoka four years ago, and it still hasn't recovered from all the damage he caused. Mr. Nojiri, many call Gamera a threat. Yes, in the past Gamera fought the Gyaos and saved the world from the Legion. I don't think we'd be living as we are without him. Now, he certainly caused a great deal of destruction in Shibuya. However... I don't think we should be making allowances for Gamera... Breaking news... A plane crash? In Egypt? - Tell the presenter. - You sure? The newsroom's going crazy. Get the newsroom. ...there's no proof that Gamera really means to aid humanity. Are you saying we can reach a mutual understanding with him? That's something we'd have to investigate. Excuse me, we have news just in. Let's go to our newsroom. A Royal Air Systems jumbo jet has disappeared over Egypt en route from Singapore to Berlin. Before losing contact, the pilot reported a giant bird, which it is feared may have some connection with the Gyaos. It is not known if there were any Japanese on board the aircraft. Mr. Masuda? This just in: a Gyaos bird has been seen west of lquitos, Peru. Unconfirmed reports say it was attacked by Gamera. Again, a Royal Air Systems jumbo jet has disappeared over Egypt... Yes? It's Asagi Kusanagi. Iris! Iris! Iris... I'm sorry. You were lonely, weren't you? Sorry. You were Iooking for me, weren't you? I won't Ieave you again. Iris, I'm so hot. I've been abroad studying to find out about my connection to Gamera... ...why I was able to see into his heart. The more I study the Gyaos, the less I understand. In the South Pacific, there's a way of thinking called Mana. They call the supernatural power that lives in all things Mana. Is that hard for you to accept? No, not at all! Go on. I think it's Mana that we're seeing. So Gamera consumes Mana? I think it's his only choice, because the environment's changing so fast. Creating all these Gyaos birds... That may also be why the Legion invaded Japan. It's as if Japan eats Mana. Something even worse could happen. What do you think could happen? It may already have started. And what will Gamera do? I don't know. All I know is, I trust Gamera. - Where's Ayana? - Dunno. I dunno. Really, I don't. Okay. Hirasaka! Hirasaka! Hirasaka! Ayana! Ayana! - What's happening, brother? - Get out of here! - Is she alright? - Are you alright? - Hurry! - Ayana! Ayana! Hey, Satoru! I'll bring her some clothes. Hey! I thought you didn't know anything! - Of course I didn't! - My brother saved her! Tell the truth. Get going! PIease... Hey! There are confirmed reports of a large Gyaos-type bird over the Conchos River basin of Mexico. The USAF is also said to be in combat with an unknown force over the Gulf of Mexico. No further details are available. And now, the weather. A powerful typhoon is gaining speed as it approaches Japan. Those searching for victims of the destruction in Shibuya by the giant creature, please register at the tent on the left. Those wishing to volunteer to help, please apply at the tent on the right. I went to Hokkaido and lived with cows and horses, because I wanted to go far away and forget the Gyaos. But dairy farming was too hard. I couldn't do the work. So I went to the brewery as a watchman. Then the Legion came. I was afraid to be alone, so I came to Tokyo... ...to become one of the crowd. I can't help you. All I'd do is be in everyone's way! Only because you think that way. Good evening. The Chief Cabinet Secretary held a press conference today after reports of a giant bird in Nara Prefecture. Following similar worldwide reports, a giant bird has been seen near the village of Minami-Asuka in Nara... Really? I'm going there tomorrow. I run and run and I can't escape. I'm tired of running. If I can do anything, let me help. Inspector Osako... Former Inspector. And just Assistant Inspector. Tastes good! Beer hasn't tasted this good in a long time. Get ready! What a mess! Ready... Lift! Forward. The Gyaos never did this before. Twenty-seven victims confirmed! EIeven men and sixteen women. About half of the village. We'll send the names later. Weren't there any witnesses or anything? The telephone lines were cut at a place they call the Shrine Swamp. We're going to talk to survivors now. Whereabouts is that? There's a little shrine there, an old one, and a cave. Send this to Mr. Sakurai at the National Genetic Research Lab. Thanks. This looks a lot different from the Gyaos we know. Yes... But it's dangerous to only go on what you see or feel. Where are you going? I'll have a Iook around. Around here? You! Wait! Are you alright? Why did you run away? Did you see something strange? Ayana, they're all dead. Auntie, Uncle, Shigeki... This way. - A curved jewel? - Yes, a black one. It's a bit different in size and shape. Can I come down there tomorrow? I'd like to meet the girl. On each side of the brain is a hippocampus. They affect memory formation and emotions. Hers are swollen very Iarge. How can that be? That's what I'd like to know. - Anything else? - Not really... She keeps mumbling something, though. "Iris..." or something. This girl from Nara and the one who communicated with Gamera have a lot in common. And if she's somehow connected with a Gyaos-like organism... What does that mean? Wouldn't you like to know? RE: MATERIAL FOUND AT MINAMI ASUKA VILLAGE Sample A, chromosomes from the eggshell match those of the Gyaos. But sample B, those from the mucus, are unknown, a different organism. ARE GYAOS BIRDS HATCHING ALL OVER THE WORLD? VICTIMS REPORTED ACROSS THE GLOBE Today, if I can, I'd like to talk a little more to that boy we met. Ms. Nagamine, telephone. It's a child. Right... What do you mean, moving her without her family's permission? Well, what else could I do? The papers were in order, and all the family she has left is the boy. Where did they take her? Well... I was told not to say. That's kidnapping! Kyoto... "The shell that sleeps beneath the sea "is the vessel of an evil spirit. "Save this land that lies between Heaven and Hell. "Conquer this evil spirit, and drive it to the ends of the Earth." Daisuke, come here! Hurry! Hurry! Iris... No! Help me! No! No! Roger. All units move out. 37th Regiment, proceed to Yoshinoyama at 1400 hours. Over. GROUND SELF-DEFENSE FORCE SHINODAYAMA BASE The cabinet views Gamera as the enemy. I'm afraid that I have to disagree with that. My powers are limited however. This is all I can do to help. The girl is being held there... Thank you. Be assured I won't reveal the source of this information. Goodbye. She was in the creature's cocoon, wasn't she? According to the boy who saved her. He told me something that bothers me. Ayana hates Gamera. Halt! The creature hasn't moved. This is Field Command. Continue to observe from a safe distance. KYOTO Ms. Asakura's not coming. If not for me, you'd be stranded here. At last, we meet. I'm Shinya Kurata. Where's Ayana? Inform Command. Target's moving. Field Command, this is Forward Platoon. Target's in motion. Prepare to fire! Forward Platoon, report. Forward Platoon, what's happening? You brought Ayana to a shrine? Imagine the Gyaos as a natural enemy of humankind, reducing its swollen population numbers, like a reset button for a decadent civilization. - Who would think like that? - Someone who thought like me. Then imagine that Gamera was born to smash that kind of arrogance! You have a point. What do you think of Gamera? Gamera's a vessel. That grave they found under the sea, you heard about it? It's a dump for the vessels that didn't become Gamera. The ancients created beta versions and summoned Mana to them, giving rise to Gamera. So Gamera heeds the Earth Spirit more than humanity. But you know that better than I do. I think Gamera has severed his connection with us. Yes, when the curved jewels were broken. But I think Gamera is still connected to humanity. After all, who brought him to Sendai? That's Gamera's greatest weakness. Tell Command we're retreating to the second line! This is Forward Platoon! Retreating to line 2 with heavy casualties! Hang on! Ms. Nagamine! I'm taking Ayana to a hospital in Tokyo. On what authority? The Gyaos mutation from Nara may have tried to fuse with her nervous system. Her life may be at risk. And the creature? What would a fusion like that accomplish? I can't imagine. It can even alter its own chromosome structure after such a fusion. Let's go, Ayana. Hi! You must be hungry sitting here all this time. Listen, what do you want to do? At least, tell me that. Save her. I can't hear you. Save Hirasaka. Right! We're off to Kyoto. Kyoto? To save her, you've got to be where she is, right? She's in Kyoto. That means... it might be heading there, too. It? In pursuit of target. So that's the Gyaos that wiped out a whole platoon? It's not confirmed as a Gyaos. The shape is quite different. - Can the AWACS follow him? - Yes, sir. - Any F-15s nearby? - Patrolling Irako Channel for Gamera. - Divert them. - It's heading into the typhoon. And for a populated area. Lead it out to sea and finish it off. What's going on? There's fear of landslides, so service is temporarily suspended. We can't get home! We'll start up again the moment the weather improves. KYOTO The Meteorological Bureau reports that Typhoon 8 is heading directly towards Kyoto. Cougars 1 and 2 report contact. Within range. Fire a warning shot. Target responding, attacking with tentacles! - Evade. - Cougar 1, Cougar 2, evade! Target attacking again! Permission to fire missiles. Target is maneuvering too fast to lock on! Unidentified flying object closing on combat theater at 500 knots! Gamera? Cougar 1, out of ammunition. Cougar 2, unable to fire. Target changing course to Kii Channel! Maritime Command reports Gamera over the Enshu Sea. Gamera is your new target. Order all planes to eliminate him. And the other one? Gamera first! Order the Patriots ready to fire. 14TH ANTI-AIRCRAFT UNIT, HAKUSAN STATION All train services postponed due to typhoon... Is it getting close? Does it want Ayana so it can complete the fusion? 14th Anti-Aircraft Unit reports Patriots ready to launch. Permission to fire. Patriot launch confirmed. Twenty seconds to contact. Hit confirmed. Gamera losing speed. Second target descending. Into the Typhoon? To Kyoto. Humanity is plodding towards its own extinction. Even without the Gyaos. But there could be a worse future for the Earth than our extinction. My idea, and the idea of whatever spawned the Gyaos, is that a monster could lower the curtain before that future comes. So if Gamera tries to stop it, it'll smash him even if he is an Earth Spirit. The Gyaos can't lower any curtain. Not the Gyaos, a new creature. One already in place, or one that can evolve itself. A creature that can, just as Gamera once did, join with a human being to make itself stronger. One that can fuse with this girl to overcome Gamera. A cute little thing like this is harboring a demon! Gamera can't win. Every creature, however unappealing, fights to the last to survive. Humanity as well. It's here. Ayana! Ayana! Creature near Kyoto Station! Where are the patrol planes? They can't get through the storm. Attention, all passengers. Services to Kyoto station are canceled due to a monster reported in that vicinity. We repeat. A monster has appeared near Kyoto station... Hey! Iris... That's it? The children of Gyaos were destroyed, but their descendants are here. Surviving through the ages, as a former shrine priestess should know. It was your task to mediate with the monsters. But the blood of your house has grown thin. It's a child of this time who must join with the demon. But Kyoto... Evacuate the area! Please remain calm! The station area is sealed off! Go back! Go! What the hell? - What's wrong with you? - I used to be a cop. Iris... Kill! - Kill! - Ayana, no! - Asagi, are you linked with Gamera? - No, it's this girl. She's fighting him. Gamera doesn't want to kill! Open your eyes! If you don't stop, we all die! Look at the fires! There are people out there! Ayana! Ayana! I join with the God Naobi to battle this evil spirit. It won't work, Ms. Asakura. And that, Ms. Asakura, is death. Ayana! Oh, this is scary! Ayana... Ms. Nagamine! Iris... Knife, do something! Do something! Ayana! Moribe... Iris, no! They've conjoined! Iris... Was it you? Was it me? Me? Did I kill them all? I'm falling! Help me! Somebody! Help me! Help me! Asagi, you'll be killed! Never quit till it's over! - Save yourself! - Gamera's not quitting! Gamera... Ayana! Sir, the Director's on the phone. Yes, sir? Come on! It can't be... Why did you save my life? Ayana! Where's Iris? Dead? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Sorry! What did he say? The US, Chinese and Russian Air Forces report that large numbers of Gyaos birds are converging on Japan. How many? Lots. The Prime Minister has ordered that our attack be switched from Gamera to the Gyaos. All land, air and sea units are to join and meet the attack. Did Gamera tell you anything? No, but I understand. Gamera will fight. To the end, even alone. Gamera's not alone. Gamera...
