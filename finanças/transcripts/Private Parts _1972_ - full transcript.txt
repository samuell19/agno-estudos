Private Parts it's Cheryl. Grab her. Pull her in. Gotcha! - Let go of me! - Well, what are you doing here? Nothing. I forgot my key, that's all. Cheryl, you damn... Hey, take it easy. I told her if I ever caught her peeping at me again I'd-- Maybe that's how she gets her jollies. This is my room, too. You're always in here with boys! See? She's jealous because she can't get any action for herself. - Nobody's interested in robbing the cradle. - Shut up! Hey, maybe you'd like another lesson, in case you missed any details. - Come on, let's strip her. - Get your hands off of me! Come on, Judy, cool it! Will you cut it out? - Judy! - Just relax, will you? Leave her alone. Just forget it. Calm down. Judy, you're really sick! - Don't you call me sick. - Cool it! She's just a kid! What do you mean, "kid"? She's only two years younger than me. She's just too nosy for her own good. When it comes time for action, she always cops out. That's right, run home to Mommy and Daddy. I just hope they don't turn you over to the police. You don't have to worry about me. I have places to go. - Just give me my money. - What money? We're flat busted, baby. So you better shove off home if you still got your ticket. Maybe you two should think this over. After all, you did come a long way together. Let her go. She's too young to make the scene anyway. I'm sorry I ever brought her. You didn't bring me, Judy. I paid both our ways. If it wasn't for my money... You mean the money you stole from your parents, don't you? That's the reason she isn't too eager to go home. Honest, Cheryl... I don't know why you had to come all the way to LA... to hide in closets and peek in windows. Go to hell, Judy. Baby mustn't forget her teddy. See you around. KING EDWARD HOTEL THE HOTEL - Hello. - Hello. - Looking for a room? - I'm not sure. - Are you the manager? - No. But she should be around here somewhere. You live here? I certainly do. It's very conveniently located. Well, good luck. - Perhaps I'll see you again. - Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry, I have no vacancies. There's a place down the block you might try. No, l.. This is one of the last respectable hotels left in the city. And we have to be extremely selective about our clientele. Please, I'm looking for Mr. Atwood. You mean Mrs. Atwood? I'm Mrs. Atwood. Then you must be my Aunt Martha. I'm Cheryl Stratton from Cleveland, Ohio. Stratton? - Lena Stratton? - She's my mother. That's impossible. These glasses make me look older, I guess. That isn't the word for it. Aunt Martha, do you have a room that I could possibly stay in? I'll have to think about it. But go on upstairs before we tell the whole world our business. What gave you the idea to come here? Well, I was in the city... and I thought I'd come for a visit and stay maybe a day or two... if it isn't too much trouble. I don't know what you're looking for, but you won't find it here. No, I just need a place to stay. Look, I'm kind of mixed-up right now, and I just need some time to think. You ran away, didn't you? Yes, I did. But you have to understand. My father was drinking himself to death. You don't have to explain anything to me, child. It's none of my business why you ran away. Have you got any money? A few dollars and my bus ticket. But I could help out. You can stay in this room for a couple of days. It's nothing fancy, but I guess you'll be all right. The bathroom's two doors down. Now, I'm letting you stay here on one condition: that you promise not to wander around the hotel alone. - This is no place for a little girl. - Sure, all right. Now you get some rest, and I'll call you for dinner in a little while. Thanks, Aunt Martha. Go wash that paint off your face before you come to the table. Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl named Cheryl. Could you tell me if she is staying here? Cheryl? The name is not familiar. However, there was a young lady in here a little while ago looking for a room. - Are you a friend of hers? - No, not really. But I'm afraid she's kind of in trouble, and I just want to warn her. Warn her? She took something from this friend of mine... that didn't exactly belong to her. I'm sure she didn't mean any harm... but if she doesn't give it back now, there's gonna be trouble. My friend is pissed. Well, my boy, I may be able to give you some information... but this is hardly the place to discuss these matters. If you could just tell me where I could find her. I'll tell you what. Why don't you come to Room 319 in about three minutes? It's straight up those stairs to the third floor... and then almost down to the end of the hall. You can't miss it. Don't forget. Room 319. Three minutes. I'll just slip into something, make myself more comfy. BATH God damn this bathroom. There's always somebody in here when I want to take a piss. Yes? It's me, Martha. Dinnertime. All right. I'll be ready in just a minute. - Where's Uncle Orville? - Orville? He passed on several years ago, age of 73. Mother said that you and Orville had a little girl. Not Orville, just me. He was too old. We went to a doctor and worked it out another way. Didn't need Orville. Where's your daughter now? That's her silverware and dishes you're eating off of. She'd be nearly twice your age if she were here today. What happened? I guess you'd say she's in the Lord's hands. THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM UNDRESSED Aunt Martha? It's all right, child. I've been doing this by myself for years now. But I want to help. it's the least I can do. That's Mr. Lovejoy. He keeps himself company. He sounds drunk. Aunt Martha, who lives in the room next to mine? Nobody. it's a storage room. Why do you ask? Well, I heard noises in there. - What kind of noises? - Just sounds, that's all. You must be imagining things, child. That room's empty... and locked. Been empty for years. Mrs. Quigley, this is my niece, Cheryl. She's staying with us for a while. - Alice? - No, not Alice. Alice! Mrs. Quigley used to own this building. She was a very rich woman until 1929. Who's Alice, Aunt Martha? Just a girl who had a room here a long time ago. - It's me, Doctor. - How old was she? Alice? Dear, maybe you'd better let me do this room by myself. That's okay. I want to help. Yes, but this room's a little peculiar. Well, who have we here? The charming young lady I met yesterday, if I'm not mistaken. Got yourself a room, have you? I'll wager you charmed your way right into Mrs. Atwood's heart. I'm Mrs. Atwood's niece. I should have known. I can see the resemblance. Tell me your full name, please. What for? It's well you ask, but never fear. I shall tell you something of great value, I promise. Cheryl Stratton. No, spell it out, please. C-H-E-R-Y-L S-T-R-A-T-T-O-N. Yes, very good. This is a lovely one. Let me see. We have... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... BIBVBII consonants. Eleven consonants! - What's so great about that? - What, indeed? My dear child, anyone possessing these eleven consonants... is one of God's elect. Right. My dear Mrs. Atwood-- - I know. I heard. -Isn't it marvelous? Does that mean you're going to pay the rent? I've just been studying your horoscope, dear heart... and I have found some most intriguing signs-- If you would pay your bill, Reverend, I'd consider that a most rewarding sign. You will come back, won't you? In cases like yours instruction is most important. - Who's he? - His name is George. He's a photographer. - A professional photographer? - Certainly. Has his darkroom in the basement. He's kind of strange. Good-looking, though. You think so? DESIRE IN THE SHADOWS "Desire in the Shadows." on the bed and roughly began to kiss every part of her body. Hot, sensuous How do you like it so far, Cheryl? It's a pity you're not feeling well, child... otherwise I'd insist that you come with me. Thanks, but somehow I don't think I'd enjoy a funeral too much. Besides, I didn't even know the lady. It's not a question of enjoyment. I hate leaving you here alone. But, of course, you won't be completely alone. I have someone to keep you company. Aunt Martha, what are you afraid of? - What is that? - This is Whitey. Don't be afraid. He won't hurt you. Say hello to him. Get him away from me! What did you do that for? I told you he wouldn't hurt you. He's perfectly tame. I've had him for years. I'm sorry, Aunt Martha. I guess I've just got a thing about rats. Now, where'd he get to? Whitey? Cheryl, if you find him, put him in the basket and close the lid. I don't want him getting into any mischief while I'm gone. Aunt Martha, was this woman a close friend of yours? No. But you did know her? Child, there are some things you're still too young to understand. Why are you taking a camera? I always take pictures for my album. Pictures of a funeral? I try to capture the exact moment when the spirit leaves the body. Well, I must get going. Now you won't go wandering around the hotel, you promised me. Of course not. Why should I? I'll stay in here and lock the door, if that'll make you feel better. Yes. Lock the door. 319 - The Reverend (Doctor) Moon Artie - Anytime Wear this for me Cheryl, I'm home. Cheryl, I'm home. Cheryl, let me in. I'm sorry, Aunt Martha. I didn't hear you. I must have fallen asleep. Everything all right while I was gone? Yes, fine. Did you stay in here? Except I had to go to my room once for a second to get something. Did you hear any noises? Noises? You said you heard noises when you were in your room. Those. No, they went away, whatever they were. Good. I brought you some candy. Thanks. And some nice Camembert for Whitey. Where is Whitey, by the way? I don't know, Aunt Martha. I haven't seen him. I'm here to fix Dr. Moon's refrigerator. - You're Artie, aren't you? - Yeah, I'm Artie. Dr. Moon's in Room 319. I guess you know the way. Yeah, sure. What are you doing here, anyway? Where's the manager? I'm her niece. She's out right now, and I'm supposed to be minding the store. But you're the only one that's come in all afternoon. Manager's niece? - How did you know my name? - I don't know. I guess Dr. Moon must have mentioned you. He talks about you a lot. You must do an awfully good job fixing his refrigerator. Yeah? He talks about me? That's very interesting. I think I'll fix the Reverend's wagon while I'm at it. Whitey. Now, where are you? I know you're hiding. You come here to your mother. Whitey! I'm sorry, I have no vacancies. There's a place down the block you might try. Wait a minute. This is one of the last respectable hotels left in the city. And we have to be extremely selective about our clientele. Listen, lady, I'm not looking for a room. I'm just trying to find a friend of mine. You wouldn't be Mrs. Atwood, by any chance? - Well? - I'm looking for your niece, Cheryl. I figured she might be staying here. - Who are you? - Judy Adams. Cheryl may have mentioned me. She and I came out here together. She used to talk about her swell Aunt Martha... who had this terrific hotel. Guess that must be you? I had a terrible time finding this place. I couldn't quite remember the name right. I thought it was the Queen's Arms or something. I sent a friend to help me find it, but he must have gotten lost. Well, get to the point. What do you want? Mrs. Atwood, is Cheryl staying here? What if she is? Mrs. Atwood, I'm Cheryl's best friend. - I'm sure she must have mentioned me. - She mentioned you, all right. Well, see, the thing is... when we left Ohio, I had to borrow some money from Cheryl... only $25. But I know she doesn't have very much herself... and I felt just awful about not paying her back before she left. You want to leave the money with me? I'll see to it that Cheryl gets it. No, I want to give it to her myself, in person. Is she here or isn't she, Mrs. Atwood? Why, yes, of course she's here. As a matter of fact, she's working for a photographer... who has his darkroom downstairs in the cellar. She's probably down there right now... mixing up some chemicals or something. Shall I tell her you're here? No, that's all right. I'll go down and surprise her. I know she'll be very surprised. Come along. It's right down these steps, all the way to the end of the hall and turn left. You can't miss it. - There's a red light over the door. - Thanks, Mrs. Atwood. Call me Aunt Martha, child, everybody does. DARKROOM - KEEP OUT! God damn it, open this door! What the... For the country's 75 to 100 top portrait professionals who deal in the lucrative high school senior market: Wow! Cheryl, is that you? That's 50 cents. Oh, no. I hope I didn't forget my money. I was in such a hurry. - You live around here? - Yeah. I'll just have to go back and get it. - Is it far? - No. Just over on Fifth. The King Edward Hotel. That's a funny place for somebody your age. Yeah, I know. I'm staying with my aunt. Listen, about the money, you can drop it off later. Thanks. - I don't do that for everybody. - I appreciate it. - What's your name? - Cheryl. I'm Jeff. Well, thanks again. Hi, Reverend Moon. How's your refrigerator doing? - Hello. - Good morning. You're becoming one of the regulars around here. Yes, I guess I am. How do you like it so far? It's all right. - Takes some getting used to, though. - Yes. I'm sure you'll get to like it. Deaths Mrs. Albert Bildner Dies; Inter-American Unit Leader Aren't you hungry? Aren't you? - What? - I said, aren't you hungry? No. I was just thinking about something, I guess. I'm not really hungry, either. I haven't felt right since Whitey disappeared. I do wish you'd come with me to the funeral yesterday. It was quite successful. Next time you're definitely coming with me. What could be successful about a funeral? At certain funerals... you can actually feel the liberation of a spirit from the prison... where it's been a captive. What do you mean? What prison? Cheryl, dear, when you're older... you'll realize that the body is a prison... that traps and bends the natural spirit to its will. It makes us weak, or sick, or ugly. It makes us into men, or women, or whatever it likes... whether we like it or not. I never thought of it that way before. You must think of it that way... so that when your time of trial comes, you'll be able to-- Hello? Just a minute, please. - It's for you. - Me? Not my parents, I hope. Hello? Hi. You probably don't remember me. I'm Jeff from the key shop. Sure, I remember. I still owe you that 50 cents. I didn't call you about that. There's going to be a rack concert in Ma cArthur Park Friday night. What time does it start? About 8:30, I think. They've got some real great rock groups. I could pick you up around 7:30, and then later we can grab some food or something. Yeah, sure. That sounds all right. - Great. I'll see you at 7:30, then. Bye. - All right. Bye. - Who was that? - Just a boy I met. A boy? Where'd you meet him? Just around. In a store near Broadway. - Oh, child. - What is it, Aunt Martha? I'm afraid you're going to turn out like all the other women in this family. You're showing the first signs already. Just 'cause I'm going out with a boy? What's wrong with that? A boy you picked up on Broadway. If you don't need any help with the dishes, I'm going to bed, if you don't mind. Don't be angry, child. - I'm only trying to protect you. - From what? Good night, Aunt Martha. Alice, is that you, sweetie? What took you so long, Alice? I want you to help me with my hair. Alice doesn't live here anymore. Mr. Lovejoy? Yoohoo, Mr. Lovejoy. I don't understand. He never goes out in the daytime. Lady, I'm afraid I'm going to have a problem with this job. We'll just have to roll him out of the way. You want to move that chair out of the way, girlie? My name's Cheryl. Yeah, thanks, kid. Let's get this table. Dead drunk. Honestly, Aunt Martha... I don't know why you put up with drunks like this in your hotel. It's really disgusting. Talk about weak spirits. All right, let's clear the rest of this mess away. Cheryl, hold this lamp. Cheryl? Did you hear me? Will you excuse me a few minutes? I have to go downstairs. MOVIES NO PERSON UNDER AGE 21 Allowed in Here THE PRYING EYE Edith, I told you I wasn't getting laid. I can't talk. There's people around here. I told you, Edith, that I went to the racetrack. I wasn't out getting laid, for crying out loud. Goddamn hippies, they're taking over this country. It's shameful! Ain't got no morals at all! All these young gals doing it left and right. They don't care. And there's nothing they won't do. You know what I mean? ...to your mother-in-law, and your mother-in-law... I wasn't... I'm coming home right away, Edith. I'll bet you like a little bit of that yourself? Right? Goddamn weirdoes are taking over this country. TELEPHONE Hello? King Edward Hotel. ls Cheryl there, please? No, she's out now. Who is this? -0Ira y, thank you. - Who is this? God damn it, lady! No privacy. George. It was you on the phone before, wasn't it? Don't you know enough to leave that child alone? When are you going to stop interfering? George, it's for your own protection. Stop it. I've had enough protection. George! Look at me. I'm going to pieces. I can't even work anymore. It's not your fault, George. If I had known she was going to get you all upset... - I'd never have let her stay. - You knew. - You did it to test me. - No, George. I thought she was just a child... but she's like all the rest in this family. Can't wait to wiggle her little body to get men all riled up. That's the way women are. İf they were any different they'd be freaks. Don't say that. It's a weakness of the flesh, and it can be overcome. I overcame it... -and I'm helping you. - Helping me? You've helped ruin my life. You robbed me of a normal childhood... and now you're trying to rob me of whatever little pleasures I can still enjoy. It's a sick pleasure, George. it's shameful. It's no more shameful than what I do with those dolls. The dolls can't hurt you, George. And you can't hurt them. - The girl's dangerous. She's liable to-- - What if she wants to be with me? Did it ever occur to you that she might love me? George, you know it can't work. You don't think I'm man enough, do you? - You don't want another Alice, do you? - I don't care anymore. I'm a human being, and I need human contact. Now. All right, George, but not her. Not Cheryl. I'll find somebody else for you, George. Do you hear? I'll find somebody. You would drive me crazy if you'd let me see you with these things on Oh, wow, this is heavy. You handle that can almost as good as a man. I handle them better than most men. Do you good to learn something useful, too. Weak women. I tell you, child... my daddy didn't have any use for those silly, painted-up creatures. Married one anyway. It was the ruination of him. All right, you can push that trash way down in there. We can pack more in there. Okay, it's all down. Cheryl, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. I'm afraid I can't let you stay here much longer. I wasn't really planning to stay much longer... but I'd like to stay a little while, if that would be all right. - I mean, you said-- - I know what I said. - But things have changed. -If it's a question of money... I was thinking about getting a job so I can pay you something. What kind of a job could a girl your age get? I don't know. I thought I'd help George out-- You stay away from George, do you hear? I don't want you even talking to him, understand? Aunt Martha, I-- You're playing a dangerous game, young lady. If you know what's good for you, you'll take the first bus home tomorrow. I mean it. All right, Aunt Martha, if that's the way you feel... I'll find out about the bus schedule right away. Hello? Hello? Anybody there? If somebody's there, you better talk or I'm hanging up. How did you like those things I gave you, Cheryl? George? Is that you? I liked them. I really did. They were really neat. I never saw anything like them before. You looked terrific wearing those things. Thank you. Was it exciting? George... I don't know exactly what you want. I love the gifts and things. I mean... you're the only one who doesn't treat me like a little girl. You think of me as a woman, don't you? - Yes. - I was wandering... wouldn't you like to really get together? We could talk or something... and you could take my picture. I'd love to pose for you, George, honest. I'd do anything you ask me to. You can come to my room, like, tonight even. I'll wear the things you gave me. Say, 10:00? Try and come, okay, George? George, are you there? Where did you meet Cheryl, son? My dad's a locksmith. We have a key shop over on Main Street. Key shop? Yeah. Anyway, the other day Cheryl came in and... Oh. my gosh! - Cheryl? - Hello, Jeff. - Wow! You look fantastic-- - Sorry, I was detained. Did you find out what time the bus leaves for Ohio? No, I didn't have time. I'll find out tomorrow. Let's go, Jeff. The concerts probably started. I hope we can still get in. I said I was sorry. You know, you're not the first King Edward girl I've ever met. No? I used to have a very good friend who lived there. So what happened? It's funny. I don't know. She just went away one day. Moved out without leaving an address or anything. Was her name Alice? Right. Alice Rogers. How did you know? I saw her picture in one of the rooms. She was pretty. She was a professional model. Do you know anybody at the hotel who could tell me where she is? Did you ask me out just to pump me about Alice Rogers? Of course not. You see, we were really good friends. I couldn't believe she'd move away like that... without leaving an address or something, or saying goodbye. She used to tell me all about her adventures... with the weirdoes who lived in the King Edward. She was actually afraid of one of them. He was a photographer, I think. Listen, Jeff, I thought you were taking me to a rock concert... not to listen to you jabber about Alice Rogers. This date's getting to be a real drag. Why don't we call the whole thing off? - Come on. - I mean it, Jeff. I want to go home now. Wait a minute. Let me-- That's okay. I can find my way home myself. Wait a minute. I'm-- And you don't have to worry about any nuts attacking me. He happens to be a very close friend of mine... that I was supposed to see tonight. He's a photographer, and he lives at the King Edward. He may seem like a nut to you... but at least he knows the difference between a child and a woman. Yeah? What's that supposed to mean? Jeff, I think there are some things you're still too young to understand. So long. There's a bus leaving tomorrow morning at 8:45 for Cleveland. I want you to be on it. Okay. Anything you say. I won't have whores and painted women in my house. George, are you there? ALICE George, you're not going to give these pictures to Prying Eye are you? I would never do that, Alice. I ha ve too much feeling for you. I thought by now you'd realized that. Why, George, I wauldn 't be posing practically naked like this... if I thought that you-- You thought I was different, not like other men. Well, it's true. lam different... but that doesn't mean I can't love you. - George, stop talking crazy. - I could make you happy, Alice. -! think I'd better go now. - I could excite you and make you love me. George, what are you doing? For God's sake, what are you doing with that needle? Please, Alice, let me. Don't do that, Alice, please. I won't hurt you. I promise. Stop it! Oh, God! Somebody make him stop! What's the matter? Isn't it just... Alice, stop that please. Stop if, George! Stop it! What do you want? You're the photographer, aren't you? George, that's your name. How would you like to tell me what happened to Alice Rogers? George. George, it's me. George, why didn't you come? I have to leave tomorrow. Are you here? George, I have to go away tomorrow... and I'm really sorry you cauldn 't come and see me. But you said you wanted to... so I thought I would take this picture of me for you to remember me by. But then, I know you like to take pictures... and I thought maybe you'd like to take some pictures of me yourself. Hello, George. I hope you don't mind if I'm here. - Do you? - No. No, I was going to come to your room, after all. You were? You look wonderful. Thank you. This is the first time we've had a chance to, you know, get to know one another. Yes, I know. Would you like to take some pictures? Yes. I'd like to very much. How should I pose? What's the best way? Different ways. Just pose in different ways. No. Not exactly. Take your gloves off. That's it. I don't know what the idea of this costume is... but I'm glad you're getting a kick out of it. - You are, aren't you? - Yes. That's it. Nice, good. Good. Nice. Pose in different ways. Why don't you take one over here? Where are you going? I'll be right there. I have to get something. What are you doing? - Hey, what's going on? - Please, it's all right. - Just lie still. Relax. I'll explain. - What's that? It's all right. Let me. I have to. It won't hurt. - What's that stuff? -It's spilling. - No! Don't! -It won't hurt! it'll be all right. - I promise! - Let go of me! George, don't! He tried to rape me! He couldn't rape you. He couldn't rape anyone. George, are you hurt bad? What did she do to you? Oh, my God! I didn't know. My son. I didn't know. Of course you couldn't know. Perhaps he's better off now. See how calm he looks? His spirit's free of that body at last. Don't go, child. You know, it's not too late for you. You don't have to grow up to be one of those women. You can still change. You can take his place. You can stay here and be my son. Your son? Yes, you could have this room. No, I suppose it wouldn't work. I'd never know what you'd do behind my back. Listen, Aunt Martha, if you want me to be your son, that's okay. You wouldn't be a good son, Cheryl. Look, I'll do anything you want me to. Only, please don't hurt me. Of course I won't hurt you. It's very quick. Alice didn't feel a thing. Neither did that boy who came here looking for you... -or his horrible girlfriend, either. - No. - I'm always very merciful. - No! Please, Aunt Martha, no! Don't struggle, child. You will only prolong your trouble. Good morning, Mrs. Atwood. I have a pleasant surprise for you this morning. My sister has sent me a bit of money again... so I'm going to pay off some... My word. You the manager here? Oh, dear me, no. I was just looking for her myself. Seen anything of a clean-cut 15-year-old boy, brown hair, blue eyes... supposed to be visiting someone here last night? I'm sure I'd have remembered if I had-- Cheryl. He came to see a girl named Cheryl. There is a young lady named Cheryl staying here. Now, let me see, she lives in Room 223, I believe. I suppose she's probably in just now. - What's down there? - That's just the basement, Officer. There is nothing down there except a darkroom, I believe. Something's going on down there. Do you hear that? You guys check that out. I'll go look for the girl. Is there anything I can do for you, Officer? No, thanks, pop. To tell you the truth, I don't know what we're doing here. The kid's probably shacked up with his girl someplace. But his old man's been calling the precinct every half hour since 4:00 a.m. Says the kid's never stayed out all night before without calling up. Let go! - Hey, that's my kid! - Sorry, kid. Are you all right? Thank God it's you. Jeff, what happened? How did you get locked up down here? Over there. In the sink. What? Jesus! Is this Cheryl? I never saw her before. But the picture's Cheryl. Do you know who did it, Jeff? I think it was a guy named George. When I saw that girl there in the sink... I figured it was a matter of time before he took care of me, too. You want me to call an ambulance for the kid? Hell, no! We're not waiting around this place for no ambulance. You can walk, can't you, boy? - I'm not sure. - Sure you can. Come on. Show the man how you can walk. See, he can walk. Walk, for Christ's sake! What about Cheryl? Did George get her, too? Will you stop worrying about Cheryl? Once we get out of here, I'll buy you a piece. Anything, just don't say nothing. Take it easy, Dad. Jesus Christ, kid, if you're gonna get physical with a chick... you ought to make sure you're bigger than she is. Any sign of the girl? No, her room's empty. Bed hadn't been slept in. If you'd seen the freakos that live in this joint, your bed would be empty, too. There's a girl lying in the sink downstairs with her throat cut. Come on, Jeff. Aren't you hungry? Don't you want a hamburger or something? Sure, Dad. As soon as I find out what happened to Cheryl. That broad again? Where were you when he let you have it, Jeff? He's a minor. He don't have to say nothing. A clam, get it? You're a clam. Up on the third floor someplace. - I don't remember the room number. - Come on, we'll find it. Excuse me. Have any of you seen Alice?

Think you can remember which room it is, kid? It's down there, I think. On the right. Right there. George's room. That's George's room! We're going to pay a little call on George.

We'll go anywhere. Just get us out of here. I wonder if I'll ever find out what really happened to Alice. Who's Alice? I thought it was Cheryl you came looking for. Now you're worried about Alice, too? No wonder your grades are so lousy. Dad, you don't understand. Don't worry, kid. Our homicide boys are terrific. If this Cheryl is alive, they'll dig her up. Alice, too. I'm sorry. I have no vacancies. There's a place down the block you might try. Perhaps there... This is one of the last respectable hotels in the city, you know.
