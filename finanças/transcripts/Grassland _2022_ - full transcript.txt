FILIMO presents proudly. Is it him? I think so. You're not sure? He wore a helmet, but it's the same style. Get off. I want the money. Give me two days man. I'll pay you. Who are you? Let me be. Based on a true story. The ways and laws mentioned in the movie Do not represent the actual ones in the country. Stay back. Don't touch them. Stay back, ask them to stay back. Stay back. My condolence. Where did the boy drop? Right here. Where were you? Put your hands up. Keep it up like that day. Why did you come here? I'll kill you. Hold him back. You didn't look up to check. I was watching the suspect. How couldn't you see the six years old boy? I swear I can't wish the same for his own child, I swear I can't. Why should my boy be sacrificed, Oh God. I've had nightmares for a week, he's standing up there saying "mom I'm scared". How many times you said stop? How many times you said stop? Once or twice? He was running away, there was nothing I could do. You asked us to get him. Like this? He wanted to be a football player. He wanted to be rich and buy cars. We should leave here as soon as possible, things are getting out of control. Please leave. I hope the one who did that to you dies. Hello sir. Is Haji in his room? Hello, good-job everyone. Please glue them and bring it to my room, thanks. Hello sir. Aghili, come in for a minute. Yes sir. My guest will come soon, send someone so to clean my room. Yes sir. Sir, I wanted to say something. Later. Are you still here? Sir, me being transferred is canceled. I thought you're upset about the boy that got killed. Aghili. Bring the letter from the court, and give it to him. The court? They asked for you. They don't know about the details. The death of the child is the main detail. You know, I've been after this transfer for six months, you know everything about my life. You applied a wrong arrest warrant, you ruined a family. We didn't have more evidence, how could I know that the stupid officer would have a free shot and kill someone? An experienced investigator first investigates, then acts, but you acted first then apologized. Haven't you been learned these subjects? Why do you wanna go to Tehran? Tehran has enough crimes, and you wanna add more to it? Good-bye. - Sir, please... - Bye. Ms. Mohammadzade. Yes What's this? What? They weren't supposed to send new cases here. Yes, but they said there are too many cases, and Mr. Ardestani is on a vacation, so they sent it for you. It's nothing, it's a fight in a garden, they sent it from police office. One of them is in coma. Is this nothing? I don't know sir. Send them in. It's a long story. I'll tell you later. Fine, later. Take this. Take this cigarette as well. - Was she your girl friend? - Why do you care? Tell me, who else was with you when you were with me? At that time, even dogs didn't look at me. So was I a dog that was with you for two years? Let me be. Miss, you go that way. Fine, you think I let you investigate me? Hello madam, we brought the test result. Leave it on the table. Hello, here you are. Thank you. You may leave. - Should we leave now? - Haji should see it and then order. Come back next year. Why so late? He should read the whole document and then order. Then take it to him, does this take a whole week? It's not only you, I put yours in order. Please do it, don't make me angry at this morning. Please let us see Haji for a minute, we're coming from far away. Don't insist, it's not possible. We're busy, we can't come again. Don't waste my time. Let me see him for a minute, we're so busy, please. I won't make any promise. You should wait. Sure we wait. - Wait outside. - Thanks. Thank you. A bunch of crazy people. Where are you going? I was inside, I went to the restroom. We rent it every last week. People come and enjoy it. It's a nice garden. You're the caretaker of there, how can you rent it? This is how we earn money. Everybody does that. Everyone's wrong, it's not yours, does the owner know? He's in Canada, he comes twice a year. That man trusted the wrong one. Are these your sons? No, only him What about others? Others are his friends. Stand up. How old are you? What's your name? Javad Hamidi Did you know your father rents the garden? Look at me. Did you know your father rents the garden? Yes. He rents the place so you charge at the people there right? No sir. Then what were you doing there? They were too loud? Who are you to talk? They already rent the garden. You're right. Sit. Sir, my children are good humans. Madam, did I ask you to talk? My boys are arrested for two nights. I can't sleep. Someone's in coma, if something happens to him, all your boys will be punished. Are you worried about your sleep? God forbidden. We went to tell them be quite. But they were all naked in the pool. All men and women. We are all married. You can't teach us these things. I'll hit you if you wanna talk nonsense. Sit, be quite. He's talking nonsense. Which one of you has criminal records? None. What crime sir? Come and ask for Rahim Welder, I've been renting houses for a life time, but these people are different, don't look at them like they're innocent. So you look at everyone, and you think we're different. Sir, this is what they do all the time. What are you saying? Sir, they were in bad outfits. Madam, you're so rude, my son is in coma, is it our fault now? Your son attacked us first, we couldn't look at him. Shut up, he talks like we weren't there. It obvious you came to fight. We didn't want that to happen. But it happened, my son is in coma, what if he dies? Sir, what happens to my sons? They'll be arrested for now. Who's here? Madam, you go and cancel your stamp and complete your complain and come back. Everyone leave here. You coward, leave me alone. What are you doing here? You were supposed to stay in the hospital and take care of Hamid. You left Hamid and came here for what? I'm here to complain. Why did you bring the child? We all complained, just like how father said. I was in the garden, I wanna complain myself. Who are you to complain Sara? Shabnam would you buy a drink for him? He hasn't eaten anything since morning. Get a cake for him. Sara, if you're here to yell, I'll do something that Hamid leaves you. I'll never let you see your child. Don't do that, it's rude. Go back. What's wrong? Don't start another fight. Give me tea and a biscuits. Do you have a hamburger? Yes. I'll have two, with cheese and mushroom. Prepare one. It's not for you, I'll take one home. How much is it? 52 Tomans, considering the Coca. Where's Hana? She's with me. In the garden? No we're in our own house dear Shahram. How can you live there? Do you have any better options? You and I are different, but that child should not be with those addicted people, let her go to your parents. Really? Wanna send her to you? You're her father based on the test. Stop talking about the test, how can I say I had this child ten years ago before the surgery? Exactly. Please serve her the hamburger so we can leave. And please clean this place. Send all the boys to prison. Sure, we have an emergency call from the prosecutor's office. Soldier, calm them down. It's your fault with your son. Leave me alone, he ruined my reputation by being a smuggler. I wish you'd die. Soldier, come and take them away. Don't worry, I'll take care of the case. Hello. Hello, where were you? I had to investigate upstairs, I'm at your service now. Sit. Excuse me. Mr. Amirhossein is going to leave this place, he's going to Tehran for some personal issues. He'll be free from our trouble. Don't say that, it's me who doesn't appreciate. I'm at your service. Good-luck. Thanks. Didn't you know him? It's Mr. Sadeqi, the mayor. Sorry I don't know the people in charge, I don't live here, nice to meet you. He had a case, and I sent it to you. Which one? The fight in the garden. Sure. The family in the garden is the relatives of him. It's OK, I sent the suspects to prison. No. He wants this case to be closed right now. Sir, someone's in the coma. You already know. His reputation is in danger, it's not appropriate to have his relatives in prison. Stop it. Listen sir. I've been a manager in this city for forty years. I don't want my reputation to be ruined, you get me? I'll try. Call me If you needed anything. I'll try. Anything else sir? Good-luck. Bye. Excuse me sir. Please a minute. Excuse me sir. What's up? I wouldn't ask if I wasn't in a hurry, please transfer me. Fine. Fine, I'll take care of it. You just take care of that case. Fine. Amirhossein, don't have free shot again. He's always in the corridor, and they say he's busy. Is that him? Yeah. Sir. This woman is one of the complaints of the case. What's your relationship with the man who's in coma? He's my husband. Call her family and bring them in. Soldier, bring these two in, stand up. Go to the room. Let's go and talk to him. Wait. Everyone, go inside the room. Go in madam. Sir, please, I won't waste your time. Sir, I came to you, you asked us to take a test, I did it and now I brought the results. Go and talk to my assistant, don't stand here. Sir, we're busy. Give me their documents. Fine, tell me if there's anything else, otherwise please come and sign here. These men can go. No sir, we told you everything. Sir, what happens to my husband? He's in coma. The doctors said he'll be fine. I know that he'll be fine. I hope he'll be fine, come please. Please. Do you sleep well at nights? Don't you have a child? What did he tell you that you're canceling the case huh? Answer me, what did he tell you? Go and sit. Your family consented. Did they? Did you? You did that? Look at me, you consented? Sir, she's not well, her husband is in the hospital. Why did my father in law come here? He's making them free. Tell me how did he buy your faith? Did he offer you lands and house? Sit. Sir, my daughter in law is not in a good situation, her husband is in coma. Please sit. Take the child out. Don't cry dear, please stay out. Madam, come out with me. Everybody in, soldier, don't let anyone leave this room. Madam, let her come. Soldier, no one leaves this room. Sir, my sister is not feeling well, let me come please. No one leaves this room. She's not feeling well. Fine. Madam, I know it's not a good situation, but answer me without any imply. If you accuse anyone they can complain against you. How many people were in the garden? All the people here except my mother in law. Is that it? Including my husband who's in hospital. When did those men come to the garden? I don't remember, at the end of the night. Last night? The other night. Listen to me, was there anything else besides the things that were added to the case? Please tell me. They chained my husband to a tree. Excuse me. Did anyone rape you as well? How many of them were there? Exclusively translated by FILIMO I was lying on the ground, I don't know. Calm down dear. Go out. What happens now sir? Everyone sit. Everyone sit. What happens now sir? All the women should go to take a test. Why sir? Why are you making it so complicated Sara? What did you tell him outside? Nothing happened sir. Then why are you crying? My brother is in coma. Sir, they keep changing their minds. Sir, they were all drunk, they're talking nonsense. I can ask to kick you out if you're not gonna be polite. We just rent a garden, Oh God. Sir, they were drunk and they wanted to stab us with knife. We just defended ourselves, and now one of them is in coma. Where's the knife? It's in the garden. Sir, we didn't have any knife. Madam, you were drunk, you couldn't even walk. Sir, the ones who's in coma wanted to hit us with the knife, go and search the garden. Shut up. Calm down, don't make me throw both of you out. Madam Did you use alcohol at that night? Sir, my children are not a fan of it. I asked herself. I said did you use it? Sir, is that the problem now? Yes, that's a crime. Sir, I've been raped, doesn't that matter? What are you talking about? What rape? She keeps lying. Sir she's lying. You might do everything, but my boys don't do these things. Sara, you're the bride of a special family. You were not sober Do you remember the night they came? Not all of it, but I remember everything. Just because we were drunk, can they rape us? You were not sober, how do you remember? Why didn't you tell me about alcohol outside? You were drunk, your companies don't agree that, you were drunk, how can you remember the rape? Maybe they were someone else. I'm sure, I remember their faces. It should be proven, you're in a court, you should talk with proof. Maybe you wanted extortion. They don't have anything to extort. Sir is there any cameras there? No. Madam, there's no camera there, you should talk with proof. Your families don't agree with you, even your sister, how do you expect me to believe you? Cause you sit there. Sir, they were drunk, but I wasn't, they just hit Hamid, that's it. You didn't drink, but the ladies did? I don't, it's Haram. Is it Halal to go in to the pool with them? - Silent. - They're not man enough. You should drown them all. Look at me. I'm talking to you, with what did you hit him? - I didn't. - Then who did? I swear I don't remember. It was so crowded. You don't remember huh? If anything happens to the man in coma, the six of you will be in trouble. I'm warning you. I'll make you talk with force. I would do something to you so you wish for death. It's your choice to be silent. Sir, I didn't do anything wrong, I swear I didn't know who hit him. You'll know who did it after you are punished. You will remember everything. Sir I did it. Rahim. Sir he's lying. - Silent. - He attacked me. Let him be. He attacked us, and he got scared. And I hit him from behind. Sir, the small one hit him with a knife. - You were drunk. - I don't drink. Go out, you can't be silent. Sir, I swear that small one hit him. Do your ladies use alcohol all the time? Sir, does it matter in this case? He sent someone to coma, and you're stuck on alcohol? I asked do your ladies use alcohol all the time? - Just answer me. - Yes all the time. We drink ever where we go, weddings, watching footballs, what should we do now? Do you want us to get arrested? I'll do it in time. It seems you want trouble. Sir, that's what they do, and they go to pool with each other. All women should take a test. Why should everyone do that? My daughter in law is crazy, she's been using tension pills for years. Everyone knows that, even her sister. Ask her sister, Ms. Shabnam you tell him. Madam Does your sister take tension pills? Look at me, answer me. Does your sister take tension pills? Sometimes when she's nervous. Shabnam Do I take pills? They're my relatives, why do you support them? Mehran Mehran do something. Soldier Soldier Come take him out. Arrest him. Aren't you ashamed? You ruined our lives, and now you're hitting on my wife in this court? Ms. Mohammadzade call the guards. I won't be silent. Go out, you're not talking in streets. Be silent. Take him out. I'm saying they hit our wives, and you care about our alcohol. Take him out. - Tell us what happens to them? - Take him out. I won't let them live if they get free. Go out. Go out. Arrest him. Let him be, fix these chairs. Set the tables, come and sit. Let me be. Madam, make your boys sit. I'll take care of you now. Sit. You sit man. Why couldn't you shut your mouth? Sit. Don't they claim I'm crazy and a liar? Then send me to take a test. Sir. Didn't my husband talk to you? Then what are you doing now? You did what you had to. Sit. I want to talk to you sir. I want to talk to you sir. Sir. You're gonna ruin our reputation after the test. Please let this be finished. These ladies should take the test, if it's positive then the case will be sent to upper levels of investigation. There's nothing I can do. Sir, they were killing my boys, they're lying. The judge only can command, I'm just an investigator, just pray that man stays alive. And the tests would be negative. Finish this case, we won't claim for anything. They don't want to claim for anything sir. Send them out. Soldier, take all of them to prison. Everyone out, madam come out. Sir, what happens to my children? Out. Everyone out, accompany them so they won't start fighting. Hey you. I'm talking to you. Come here, go to my room. Sir, what do you want from him? I've got some questions. One of you should stay so to take him later. Please leave. Soldier, send them away, and look for these things. Fast. Wait a minute. Leave, I said what I had to say. Leave. Yes? Please let this be finished, I'll do anything you want for you. This case is already obvious. You should not let them go for your reputation, they're gonna do the same to another family. - Leave. - Sir. Don't make troubles for yourself. Out. I know, all of you want to ruin your father's reputation. If people find out about your test, you won't see your child again. I'll make you divorce Hamid, I'm warning you in front of your sister. Thanks Mr. Mehran, we talked a lot last night, you don't even care about that poor Hamid. At least consider your father. He supported you a lot. Didn't he help you? Why? Let me remind them. Ms. Sara, won't you be ashamed if people point their fingers at you? You talk in a way like we're to be blamed. Then who is to be? I don't care about people. I didn't go to the pool and drink alcohol, Mr. Mehran why should you go to pool with your sister in law? With a relative of Haji. That's how our family was. I'm trying to take care of Haji's reputation, but you can't support that even when we're alone. If he was a real religious man, his daughter wouldn't drink alcohol. I'll take care of her in time. Why did you attack them? Shut up, I hate your face. Don't get tricked by your body, I'll ask my men to take you away. I don't care of someone else wants to be a mayor, you go and take your claim away. I won't let them be, I'll take my revenge. Sara forgot that she used to hit on my brother in university. And now they act like they didn't want to get married to him. Madam, thank God, I've got my own business, and I don't owe anyone anything. And I don't care about your father. He doesn't care about his reputation, he's just worried his father's opportunities might get lost. My father can do anything, but I don't benefit from it. You're jealous you didn't get anything. No coward, I don't feed on anyone else, even if he's my father. Shabnam is working in that hospital because of my father, otherwise no one would let her work there. It's not something especial, many nurses are working in that hospital, he just made a call that's it. I wish he wouldn't. I hope she leaves her work, I don't need her income. You didn't use to act like this, but now that the job is done, you act so rude. Your husband should make everything up, he owes everything to Haji. You found a job for her, stop bragging about it. Like I couldn't find a job for myself. I won't let anyone hurt my lady. If that was true you wouldn't be in the pool with her. Shut up. Shut up Sajjad, I go to pools and I admit everything I drink. I'm not like you pretending everything, if you were a man, you could show your tattoo on your knees to Haji. Shabnam, take your manly husband and go. Shut up. Coward. How rude. What gardens are in your village? Mostly cherry and sour cherry. You eat them and leave the rest in someone else's garden right? Do you know whats the punishment for that? I'll make them hang the six of you in your town. I'll do something to you so that no one can save you. I'm gonna do that. The test result is not clear yet sir. What? The test result is not clear yet sir. Yeah, you're sure, but it will be soon. I've seen many people being hung. You're just one of the many. But I haven't seen four brothers to be hung together. Your poor mother, have you seen her? She was worried about you. She also accused them, she's gonna be in prison for at least four years. I swear I arrest your mom, you ruined your family. I'll sign your death sentence so easily. And I'll send you to the investigation room, they're gonna do things to you so that you can't sleep till your death sentence. I'll ruin the six of you. But we didn't do anything wrong. You know. I'll hang the six of you at the same time. Six pairs of feet like this. Then you'll understand there's law in this country. Sir Please do us a favour, we didn't have a father. Please do something for us, don't let them hang us. I'll be your servant forever. If we all die, my mother will die as well. Of course I can free you, I can even get you an uber, it takes you to your mom. how's that? I swear we didn't know they were couples. What? I swear we didn't know they were couples. What difference does it make? What difference does it make? I'm to be blamed sir. Shame on me. I stabbed with that knife, but Rahim said it was him. Go on. Please let me go. Shut up and go on. I ate humble pie, I won't do such things again. The girl wearing creamy used to come there frequently. There was a doctor who used to bring girls there. Once he brought her as well, but this time I didn't know they're families. Sit and tell me explicitly, who are you referring to? Which girl? The one with creamy outfit. Every weekend she used to come there, I was looking at her so to see if it was her. But her husband got mad. I'm sorry. You did everything you wanted, and now you're accusing others? We didn't know she was married. So you can rape the single ones? No sir. I wanna say we ruined it. Look at me. Write down everything you just told me. I'll kill you if you change a word. Wouldn't I get hung if I write? Sir, the attorney general is here. Write. Hello sir. What are you doing? The guy called and said everything he wanted to me. You should've worked on something else, and now you're after this case? I'm on that as well. What are you saying? Please come here. Yes sir? You ordered to arrest wrongly. Your officer killed a boy. There's a corpse in the case. Everyone is looking after the case, they called from the center. Every media keeps going after this case, I don't know how to answer them. Sir. Why do you pressure me? You asked me to arrest, and now you say why I arrested? I asked you to get him, not to shoot and kill a boy. Fine, you sent a case to me, and now you want me to cancel it? I have no one to substitute you. We signed your request and it's been accepted. But I've no one qualified to place. And no one agrees to take a two hour way to here. I don't know what to do, and my own crew are busy. The mayor asked me something and we did it. He's not a suspect, he complained. Sir, he wants to use his power in this case, I won't let that. What are you saying? It's his own case. The case you sent to me is mine now, not him. Fine it's yours, but you're leaving. And I'll be left with the managers of this city. Do you know what happens if this won't get finished? Everyone keeps calling me, what should say then? Sir, go and take a look at his daughter in law. I swear to my sick child, which you know how much it matters to me, but I won't do that. It's not moral. You're in trouble for that child being killed. I'm supporting you, otherwise the security would not let you be. Amirhossein, if this goes viral, then things get out of control. It will blow like a bomb. Please don't do it. The guy says I've got no complain, just finish this. Is he OK if someone rapes his girl? It's his reputation, it's his reputation. Do you think that his kids could survive if it wasn't for their father? Let's suppose those boys asked for mercy, and they agreed. Fine, why do you fight me, go and ask her daughter in law to sign her consent. She's crazy somehow. They told her we divorce you and take your child, she said OK but I won't sign my consent. Well I can't consent that. You know what to do. No sir, You know that. - Excuse me. - Oh God. Send the next one in. Besharat, don't do that, don't let me face them. I'm talking to you. Are you finished? Yes. Bring it here. You wrote everything? Yes. Go out, I'll call you. What happens next? Don't talk to anyone about what you told me. Sure. Don't you know what happens? Soldier Go out, I'll call you. Mohsen Fardi, Fariba Etemadi. Fardi, Etemadi. Mohsen Fardi, Ali's son. Yes sir. Is it you? Yes sir. Sir, I brought him with so much difficulty, just give us the order and let us go. In identity card, it will be written illicit. Then how that child can live in this society? Her parents should answer that not me. Her parents did wrong, but the baby is innocent. People can't ask for identity cards for their illicit babies. It was so accidental, I just realized I have a baby. Please let my baby live like a normal person. Sir, she's ten now, she skipped school for three years. If you give me the order, I register her in school so she can study. Where were you during these three years? We went to the family court, they sent us here. OK, I'll explained the formal law. What happens to her future then? I'm not here to answer you. You should've thought this through when you had this baby. Sir, we are to be blamed, why do you punish the child? What if I would have abortion? We didn't know that. Please let this be. You should've got married then have intercourse. Now you should pay and get whipped. Sir hit me as much as you want, but don't call her an illicit child. You can hit us both, put us in prison, but don't call her an illicit one. What are you saying? I wanted to have an identity card so to take her to school. Don't let her be like us, let her study. Fine go out, I'll call you if it was needed. Please don't do that. Don't let her be like us, let her study. Go out. I brought him here so hard. Guide them out. I want to get the order, let me get it so she can study. Would you sign this? I wanna send it. Slower, I'm out of breath. He won't let us get an identity card. Three years ago would be as hard as now. Why didn't you ask for it when lived with your parents. The court would ask for his parents, are scared of getting whipped? I'm scared of this case, you asked me to come here, but he won't give us an identity card. Don't waste my time. - Where are you going? - I'm going after my life. Mohsen listen to me, if you don't get me that identity card, I'll ruin your life. What did you say? I'll ruin others and you want to ruin me? Now you're touching me? If you threaten me again I'll hit you. Stop threatening me. You're nothing. Mohsen if the judge writes illicit in my child's identity card, I'll burn both of you to ashes. Just let me be. You don't accept her, but she's my child. Fine, let's go now, we'll talk to the judge tomorrow. You won't come back if you leave now, please don't let him go. You should get her identity card today, where are you going? I'm going to smoke. Give me one. How dare you ask for smoke, you just cut my nerves. What happened? They say you fought and now the guy is dead. He's in coma. Aren't you ashamed? You're not in the age of fighting. You have a family of your own. Fine, you're getting carried away, who told you to come here? Shouldn't I come here to see what you've done? Where are you coming? Please leave. My boys are in there. - Let me talk to them. - Please leave madam. I'm in charge of here, you can't pass. You're like my son, please let me pass. Can you give me smoke? Where do you think you are? Do you have money? - Please leave. - Only two minutes. Give him some money. Please give him so he buys me as well. Thank you very much. I know you're being nice to us. Make it fast, there will be troubles. All my body is trembling, didn't you say you didn't do anything? I swear we just fought them. Don't swear coward. If you were innocent, that one wouldn't yell. Calm down please. Do you want me to be calm? Mrs. Razavi come at nine tomorrow. Please come back tomorrow morning. Hello. Hello, how can I help you? How can I help you? Please, talk to your boss, do anything you can for us. What's this? I've got no one but my four sons. I'll do anything you want from me. Please just leave. Mrs. Arjmandi, guide her out. Please. - What's going on? - Hello sir. What should I do? You should hire a lawyer, don't waste your time here. How? I don't know how. You should find someone for yourself. I don't have money sir. Fine I'll send a letter to the lawyers department, they'll hire one for you. Do my sons get freed? God knows. Find these cases for me and send them to my room. Just go, don't waste your time. Sir please don't disappoint me. Come here madam. Take these and leave. What are you doing? Listen to me carefully. Is something wrong? Are you fine? Yes I am. My four sons are downstairs, and they're in chain. If this goes on, the four of them will be dead. Why should I care? Is this how you ask for consent? All of them saw you. What? Does your husband know you used to that garden with that doctor? Shut up. Listen, I know my sons did wrong. But understand me, I'm a mother, go and make your sister to consent. And I'll stop my boys so not to talk about that man and cars and clothes in front of your husband. Would you pay for me or not? If you don't pay me, I'll melt you down. Make it faster. Fine. Coward. She's just like you, look at her. Tell him. Come on tell him. Hello dad. She's been in the park, I was worried about her. I brought her here, so the judge can see her, maybe she feels empathy. She's just like you. You do whatever you want. - I already told you. - What? He's being too coward. Didn't he like me? Does it matter? I just wanted him to see you once and let you be. Sir do you have smoke? What about lighter? Where are you going? - Where? - Home. I wish you were a man like Mehran. If I wasn't man enough, your father would've hung you by now. Shut up, you could at least curse them. You were all calm. You were always troubles to me. What did you want? You know I can't do some things. And I didn't complain only because of you. It's because of the favour dad wanted to give you. Favour? Being sneaky is called favour now? Does it even matter? You're not man enough. Come, I'll kick everyone like Mehran, does that matter? Give me the key. Don't make me yell, give it to me. Where are you going? Sajjad I'm talking to you. Where are you going? You asked me to consent, so I did. What about Sara? She's your bride, why asking me? If she takes the test our reputation will be ruined. What reputation are you talking to me? Give it to me. Let me be. Mom you realize me. I wanna puke when I see them. I'm your daughter, don't you see me? If Sara gets carried away, father will make her get divorced, but what about me? Where should I go so not to see my father? Last night he asked me to consent, it's better for you, does he know what's better for me? I wish I were Hamid or dead. He's worse than them, I wish he could just hit them once, he was about to appreciate them. It's father. Answer him. Take it, talk to him. Yes dad. Yes, I did what you asked me. Yes. No, I'm listening. Fine. Sure. Sure. Sure dad. Go home girl, Sajjad take her home. I'll be there soon. I won't forgive you mom. I won't forgive you Hello Hello Mrs. Sara. What are you doing? Please give me your identity card. I'm gonna register. Let these things be, let's go, I'm gonna kill them. I won't calm down, no matter what I do. If you wanted to do something, you'd be here since morning. I wanted to, but you asked me there's no complain. I'd come if I knew. She wants to talk to everyone, how was Hamid? He's fine. A message will be sent to your number, tell me the code in it. Sara, that guy is so coward, he did everything so to be part of the counselors of the city. He's a filth.

Sir go out, don't yell in here. I'm sorry, I'll support you no matter what. Reza she's already triggered, why do you trigger her? I don't care about Sadeqi, but I don't want others to point at me in the hospital and accuse me of... You call yourself siblings? Sara. I'll complain even I have to ignore you till I die. I'll complain even if my sister tells the judge that I'm crazy. That was different. You told them she's crazy? The one who does this to herself and her sister is crazy. Wait. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna buy something for Bahar. Have you thought about consequences? Yes, you're gonna lose your job. What are you talking about? you might lose everything, your life, child, husband and everything. Please, for me. If you think that Hamid gets back to life and I get to my life normally, well you're wrong. Mehran and I are fighting as well. Coward, think more, can you see yourself in a mirror? Sara... Stop ruining yourself in my eyes. I swear Sadeqi kill them all, he won't let them be, They should plead the judge so to keep them in prison. I'll complain one by one. And you should go to forensic medicine. Fine, I'm not lying. They accept whatever Sadeqi says. Sadeqi can judge on this case, why don't you understand? But you're wandering around with these papers like crazy ones. Shut up Shabnam, why don't you let me talk? Reza, I'm gonna lose my reputation in that hospital. I kept my prestige for many years, but now they're gonna point at me and laugh. Fine, now what's wrong with your husband? Didn't you two talk? He's under pressure, why don't you understand him? Why doesn't this end? Hello. Hello. Hello how are you? Why don't you answer? I've been calling you since last night, you haven't answered. What? That boy saw us in the garden, and his mother threaten me that she'll tell Mehran about it. Yes. What do you mean you don't care? No What should I do now? If Mehran finds out... I went to that garden two times with you. You don't know what's happening to me. You have relations, what should I do? Talk properly, why do you talk to me like that? Wait there. Let me be, he's even here. You came with this? He asked me to. You could take a taxi. He said he wanted to talk to his wife. I'm worried about my reputation, but you're a filth. I'm here for you, otherwise I'd kill them all. I'm not Sara, you can't deceive me, I know he gave his word about the terminal, at least shut up. Hello sir. This room has a door. You want guaranty?
