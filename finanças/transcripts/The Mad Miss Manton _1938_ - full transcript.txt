Good night. Good night. Ah, there you are, darlings. Did you miss mommy? 3:00, Miss Manton. Right on time. I went up right after you called. I had to wake your maid. Boy, was she fried-I mean, angry. If I know Hilda, she was fried, not angry. All right, gentlemen. Remember, you're out here for exercise. No loafing. Come on. Oh, what's the matter, Tiger? Oh, poor little fella. There doesn't seem to be any justice for dogs. You suffered through the building of a subway, And when it's finished, they won't even let you in. Ronny? Ronny! Hello, police? Hey, what is this, a gag? No, sir. I was to a costume party. It was on 14th street off 2nd avenue, and- Well, you see, it was an artists' ball. I had to hit a man because he tried to kiss me. And-Oh, no. I mean, the door was open, And I walked in, and he was lying there In a pool of blood-His own! Is that a reason to kill a man - Because he tried to kiss you? Oh, it isn't the same man, and I didn't kill him. Please, you've got to believe me. It's just up the street there. All right, get in, get in. Wait a minute, inspector. Lieutenant. Lieutenant Brent. Shouldn't you send two men around the rear of the house? What for? The guy's dead, isn't he? But the murderer might still be in there. Look, lady. It's 10 minutes since you called us, And the murderer-That is, if there is a murderer- Could be in Brooklyn by now- That is, if anybody wants to be in Brooklyn. Now let's take a look at the body. Quit climbing up on me. And listen, a few of you guys go around the rear of the house. You know whose house this is? It's the Lane mansion. Sheila Lane-You know, the one who married the rich old banker. They haven't lived here for a long time. Uh-Huh. Where's the body? In that room. Now if you don't mind, I’ll just run along. Sorry, lady. We'll have to ask you to hang around. Why, it's gone! It was lying right there. It's gone? It was lying right there? Yeah. Right over there? But I saw it, I swear to you. He was dead. He was dead? I couldn't see his face because he was lying on his- Now, you mustn't be frightened. And my cloak-It was hanging on the door- Don't get excited. You're among friends. We've got a nice quiet place in the country- She's not nuts. I'm not crazy, I tell you. Maybe we can find something in one of the other rooms. Yeah. We'll probably find a mama ghost, a papa ghost, And a baby ghost. What kind of a game are you playing? What's your name? Manton. Melsa Manton. Oh, Melsa Manton, eh? Aren't you one of the bunch that held that treasure hunt last week And stole a traffic light? Oh, yes, but it was a treasure hunt for charity. We run the T.B. Clinic. And aren't you the dame who got an ambulance from Bellevue Because one of your dogs had distemper? He was very sick, and the veterinary was out of town. And aren't you the dame - Yes. Give me them stomach tablets. Coming up, chief. There's a murderer loose, I tell you, don't worry. It won't fit him. Miss Manton, I don't know what your game is, But I know this - Either your education or your spanking Has been neglected. Now, I can't do anything about spanking you - Or can I? You wouldn't dare! This time, I’ll let you get away with it. But if you involve the police department In one more of your merry escapades, I'll lock you up so tight, You'll need a major earthquake to get you out. Now, go on home before I call a truant officer. All right. If I ever see another murder, Before I report it, I hope- Well, I hope I’m the victim. Chief, why can't I use this, just this once? Because it's against the law. Come on. Another batch of telegrams commending your article on the Manton girl. That's fine. Take another one. We should like to preface this editorial With the statement that wall street has hit a new low. Unemployment has reached a new high peak. An additional $4 billion has been added to the budget. But Miss Manton and her ilk Continue merrily on their million-dollar Ermine-Lined way. Make a note-According to the police, Miss Manton's costume was fetching. It seems to me that this young lady was- Are you Peter Ames? No. But I am. To complete the circle. Why, you- Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, miss. Will you please stop crying? I'm not crying. I'm just mad. Did you write this awful thing? Yes. Oh, you're Melsa Manton. You can afford your own laundry. It's quite an item with me. I'm sorry, Miss Manton. I'm a very busy man. How dare you print such tripe. It's not a question of courage. It's a question of conviction, of policy. I see. And who decides that policy? Well, newspapers are funny institutions, Miss Manton. You take an ordinary reporter like me and make him an editor, As long as he's willing to work for the same salary. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Mr. Spengler. Mr. Ames, Mr. Spengler. I'd be charmed if I wasn't so busy. If you both will excuse me- Here's the summons, Mr. Ames. I hope you don't take this personal. That will be all, Mr. Spengler. All right. Thank you, Miss Manton. A million dollars for libel. With your present income, aren't you afraid That's going to put your income tax way up into the surtax brackets? Don't worry about it. I'll give it away to charity. This is all very silly. You haven't a leg to stand on. That editorial just stated facts. You did disrupt the police force. There was no corpse. There was a corpse, and I’ll prove it If I have to find the body myself. You talk as if you were contemplating murder. Don't encourage me. That editorial really started something. So did Mrs. O’Leary’s cow. Call our attorneys right away. We can't sit back complacently and let them ridicule us. They might occasionally mention Some of the good we do. That's not the point. There's no truth in the stuff he printed, And it's up to us as a group to prove it. I've always wanted to pound a picket line. Now, Melsa, you remember the night you saw Queen Elizabeth- In all her clothes, taking a bath in your own tub. Are you suggesting, by any chance, That I had too many absinthe parfaits? We must exhaust all possibilities Before we devote our lives to a corpse-Hunt. After all, darling, you're the only one Who says there was a murder. I did see the body, and my cloak certainly didn't run off by itself. Maybe the body wasn't dead. I would have told the police that you saw Ronny Beldon Coming out of the Lane house. I didn't have a chance. I think it's foolish to get any more mixed up in this murder. No, it isn't. Melsa's right. If we don't do something quickly, the whole town will believe Everything Ames and that stupid police inspector said about us. I think it's silly, but I’m with you. Me, too. Count me in. Same here. That's swell, girls. I've called Ronny Beldon's apartment, And the switchboard operator says he won't be in till late tonight. Meanwhile, I have some flashlights. Let's all go over to the Lane house. I'll prove I’m not crazy. Can't we prove you're not crazy some other night? Sure. We'll ask the murderer not to touch a thing. Telephone for you, miss frost. There's my date. Sounds like a pipsqueak to me. Hello, pipsqueak? I mean, hello, Paul. No, I can't. Well, just a minute. Please, not tonight! Oh! Hello? Hello? Hello? Are you there? He was cut off. Poor boy, and in the prime of his life, too. Hilda, the door. I heard it. I ain't deaf. Sometimes I wished I was. Have you another piece of cake, Hilda? Yes, I have, but the kitchen's closed for the night. Hilda, Miss Beverly is our guest. I didn't ask her. Comes the revolution, And we'll stop being exploited by our help. In my house, the revolution is here. Look, I - I was told to give this To Miss Manton personally. You're Miss Manton? Yes. Thanks. The sender requests an answer, please. "May I come up and see you? Just want half-hour of your time. Peter Ames." That's our publicity agent. Have him up. We'll give him something to write about. The answer is no. In that case, here's another telegram for you. Ok, child. You'd think they'd send an older man Up to this here apartment. "I'm coming up anyway. Peter Ames." Too bad we won't be here to greet him. I'd better call the lanes at their hotel So they won't surprise us at the old house. What'll I say? Say hello. Thanks, Dora. You're sweet and very helpful. Mr. Lane, please. Well, then Mrs. Lane. Did she? Did she take a bag? Thank you very much. George Lane is out of town. Sheila left yesterday after dinner and hasn't been back since. Do you suppose she and Ronny Beldon skipped? You've heard about those two. I don't know which is more pernicious - You or anemia. That'll be your editor. Duck your flashlights. Remember, girls, I want the first stab at him. Now don't be selfish, Melsa. Oh! My cloak. "the next time you'll be in it." Oh! The murderer has been here! Why didn't I keep that date? What'll we do? I don't know. Think for yourself. Whoever committed the murder did this And is afraid we may know something. That knife ain't folding them letters. We can't let this intimidate us. That's what the murderer wants. It's all the more reason- He's come back! And I’m leaving! I'm going to open the door. Get ready, girls. We'll rush him. Oh. Very nice props, but they don't convince me. You fool! You ruined the fingerprints. Did I? I can get you plenty more fingerprints. Miss Manton, I came up to see If I couldn't talk you out of this childishness. You can't possibly win. Besides, it'll just make a lot of trouble for both of us. Come on, girls. Hi-ho, silver. Nasty man. I'll take mine in one-Dollar bills. Rigor mortis is setting in. He's cute. Oh! Come on. Oh, it's locked. Why don't the police mind their own business? You can't say we didn't try. Wait a second. I'll try the window. Let's go home. Come on, Melsa. This is the room. Go over it with a fine-tooth comb. I found the clip out in the foyer. There might be some other things lying around- Bloodstains, maybe fingerprints, Or things knocked over in the struggle. I'm scared. Melsa, where did you find the body? Right where you're standing. Aah! Melsa, let's get out of here. Oh, please be quiet. What on earth are you doing? I'm calling Paul. Silly, the thing has been disconnected for a year. Look. Blood. I found a bloodstain. Oh, how can that be blood? It's blue. Maybe they shot Mrs. Astor. No, it's ink. Somebody must have spilled a bottle of ink. Helen, you search the upstairs. Oh, no. I was never much of an individualist. If the upstairs has to be searched, we'll search it together. Why, that's communism! Shh! I don't know why we have to whisper. There's nobody else in this old barn. Turn off your flashlights. I'll keep mine on. I'm scared. Stand back against the wall. When he comes in, we'll all pounce on him. Aah! Ow! Get him, girls! See if he's got a gun first! Hey! Hey! Well, if it isn't dopey. Don't be a pig, Myra. Move over. Got a little worried, didn't you? Thought there might be something to my story after all. Wait till you dressmaker's dummies read my next editorial. I still think he's cute. Meaning no disloyalty to you, Melsa. Come on, girls. We've still got some unfinished business. You don't expect us to go to Ronny Beldon's looking this way? Come on. Help! Help! Help! Bye, darling. Hurry up! Let me do the questioning. Mr. Beldon has a lot of explaining to do. He can't cut me dead in the street, Even if he was running away from a murder. He should have been back by now. Oh... It's unlocked. It doesn't seem right to go into a man's apartment Without a chaperon. Ronny? He doesn't seem to be here. Let's see if we can find anything. Look for anything that might connect him with the murder. And don't disturb a thing. We don't want him to know we've searched the place. Helen, come here a minute. Notice anything? It's a picture of Sheila Lane, isn't it? Yes, but you see that clip? The one I described to you- The same one I found in the Lane house. Which means Sheila must have been there, too. Right. I just saw that clip or its twin sister A minute ago in the bedroom. I thought I told you girls not to disturb anything. Here it is. It is the same. I put this clip in my cloak last night. When I went out to call the police, Ronny must have gone back, Taken the body and my cloak. Do you suppose Ronny could have been the murderer? Why, I can't believe it. Come on. Let's get out of here. Where's pat? She wouldn't by any chance be in the kitchen, would she? Pat? Oh, pat! Come on, pat. We're leaving. I'll be with you in a minute. Let me see that knife. I'm hungry. I want to make a sandwich. Oh, pat, let me have that. Oh, stop. What's going on in here? If I’m not mistaken, this is the mate to the knife That was sticking in my door. This cinches it. It's Ronny, all right. And I had him up to tea. Now we'd better get out of here. Come on. Not until I’ve had my sandwich. Oh, pat, come on. Aaah! It's Ronny! Oh! My heavens! Wait a minute, girls. We can't leave pat in there. I'm not going back in there. Isn't she brave? And we all thought Ronny did it. I have a psychic feeling we're all moths to slaughter. There you are. Afraid of a dead man. Why, I-Oh! Break into the joint sharp on the hour. Don't bother with the guests. Just get the croupiers. And remember, I don't want to find any chips in your vest pockets. Lieutenant, there's a dame who wants to speak to you on the phone. A dame, eh? Hello. Manton? Sullivan, get a bicarb tablet ready. Coming up, chief. Look here, Miss Manton. We realize we're public servants, But do you realize it? Oh, you found another body? Uh-Huh. I see. Well, I’ll tell you what to do. Keep it on ice, see? It is on ice? Look here, Miss Manton. Get out of my life, do you hear? Get out of my life! All about the murder. Playboy murdered. Body found in Clarion lobby. All about it! Extra! Let's have it. Oh, hello, Mr. Ames. Say, what happened to you? I've just been initiated into the junior league. What's this? I wouldn't know, Mr. Ames. I'm just on the distribution end. Hey, extra! Read all about the big murder. Hey, Pete, I never expected A double-cross from you. I don't know anything about it. What's this all about? I get into headquarters, and this hits me in the face. I don't know, Mike. I wasn't in the office. I was tied up until now. Will you stop crawling up on me? What a scoop! We have 100,000 papers on the street already. Why weren't the police notified? We wanted to get our papers out on the street first. If any more bodies are found around here, notify the police first. If it ain't asking too much, what did you do with the body? He's in your office on the couch. What are you trying to do, haunt my couch?! I, uh... dropped in to the Lane mansion tonight. I ran into Manton and a flock of her friends. Ran into them? Looks like you met them head-on. I heard them say something about going over to his apartment. Round up that pack of dames running around with Manton. Bring them down to headquarters. Drag them out of bed if you have to. Ok, and I hope I have to. Come on. We'll pick up Manton. Wait a minute, Mike. Aren't you being a little hasty? Why don't you wait till morning? Do you think I like to do this? Do you think I like to take people, men and women, Human beings, and harass them, Pound them, beat them, humiliate them? No. But to these girls, I’m gonna love it! Fire! I’d confess for a sandwich. Confess what? It depends on the sandwich. Quiet, girls. That nice policeman has thought up another question. Why did you take the body down to the Clarion? I thought if you read it in the paper, You'd believe it. Miss Manton, we've been here all night. You're tired. I'm tired. The girls are tired. All I’m asking is a simple question. Which one of you girls murdered Ronny Beldon? And who's covering up for who? Now, is that too much to ask? I've told you before, inspector- Lieutenant. I told you that the only reason We went to Ronny Beldon's apartment Was because I saw Ronny Beldon Come out of the Lane house. Now will you let me call my lawyer? No! Just a minute, sergeant. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, I have something to say. Yeah? I think he committed suicide. Oh, you do, do you? Well, I think you got something there. He tiptoed into the refrigerator, closed the door, And stuck a knife into himself. Uhh! Come on, chief. Won't-Who asked you for it? Won't somebody please cooperate and confess? I can't stand it any longer! I'll confess! I did it! You did? Why'd you do it? Because you asked me to cooperate with you. Now, look at me. I'm a sick man. My stomach is on the blink. It's easy for me to get sick, But I want to get sick my own way! Wait a minute, Mike. I'll take it. Miss Manton, I don't happen to agree with lieutenant Brent. I don't think any of you girls did it. But you are hiding something. Now, Melsa, why don't you tell us? Miss Manton is the name. You made liars and social parasites out of us. Now we girls are going to collect that million dollars from you. And as for you, inspector Brent, False arrest is a very serious charge, And we'll have your badge before we're through with you. We're going to make you all feel pretty small and silly. Who's got a lipstick? All right. Fingerprint them And put them in the lineup. And on what charges are you going to hold us? For spitting on the sidewalk. Lieutenant, there's a lawyer out here with a writ of habeas corpus For the dames. Well, it's about time. All right, all right. And if you dames find another body, It'll probably be me. Popsy! Oh, are we glad to see you. Girls, you ought to have more consideration for my age. Who told you we were in jail? A chap named Ames. Uh, Peter Ames. A light begins to dawn. What do you mean? After all, when a man calls Melsa "Melsa"- Oh, don't be silly. You know, psychiatrists say hate's just a step away from love. Yeah, but it's the lull in between that drives you crazy. Come on, Popsy. Thanks. What for? For calling my lawyer. Why did you do it? Maybe I’m a social climber or a fortune hunter. Or maybe I’m beginning to like you very much. Anyway... I realize I should let go of your hand, But the fact is, I’m finding I don't want to. You've been very sweet. Thanks. When can I see you again? Meet me in Sheila Lane's apartment at 3:00. There'll be a big story for you. Sheila Lane? Yes. I found her clip in the Lane mansion When I discovered the body. All right, Melsa. Come on. Pat's hungry, and we're sleepy. Good-bye, until 3:00. Well, that's one way of getting favorable publicity. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Come on. Out. Out. Now what's the matter? You're under arrest. This is where I came in. Come on. Give me that clip. You unspeakable Judas. Now, Melsa- Don't call me Melsa. This isn't any pink tea. That knife in your door was no joke, Even if I thought it was. Are you gonna give me-What knife? I'll tell you later. This is murder. Neither the police department nor I Want to wake up some morning And find 8 lovely debutantes murdered. You know, he makes sense to me. Are you gonna give me that clip? Here. Withholding evidence, eh? Covered Beldon's apartment. Couldn't find a thing. Anything new? Yeah. Looks like Sheila Lane done her boyfriend in. We just got an alarm out for her. Hey, Mike, what about old man Lane? What about him? If our paper knew his wife was running around with Beldon, He must have known. Maybe he killed Beldon and tossed his wife in the river. Hey, maybe you got something there. Get an alarm out for- I hate to spoil a good story, But Mr. Thomas, his partner, told me That Lane has been out of town For the past week on business. Did he? Get that alarm out for Lane. That's Beldon's car - It's been standing outside his house For two days. Ok. You catch some sleep. I'm taking these dames back to Beldon's apartment. I'll make them talk if I have to keep them awake all summer. Now he thinks he's general grant. Shut up. Hey, you. Follow us. We'll use the Beldon car. You come with me. Let go of my arm. Wait a minute. You girls hop in the rumble seat. Ames, you'll ride with me. Aah! Aah! Aah! Shut up! That's the body! That's the body I saw in the Lane house! Old man Lane. Right on my own doorstep. It's contempt of court. Oh, it's you. I told you on the phone she won't go with you. Now, Hilda, I just want to talk to her. She don't want to talk to you. She even made me stop buying your paper. And besides, someone's coming to take her to the charity ball. I'll force my way in. If you do, she told me to throw a pitcher of water Plumb in your face. I'll risk it. It was orders, but I used distilled water. Do you and Melsa live this way all the time? Well, I done my best. She's in the living room, But I warn you, y'all better not go in there. She's in a nasty mood, and when I says nasty, I ain't mincing words. Hilda, I thought I told you to keep him out. Melsa, please. I've never run after a woman before- That is, I’ve never admitted it- But I’m running after you. You're on a treadmill, Mr. Ames. You may keep on running, but you'll remain in the same spot. Hilda, for Pete’s sake, will you get out of here? I've got things to say. I can't say them when you're standing there staring at me. Hilda, you stay right where you are. You don't know what's good for you. Listen, before I knew you, I disliked you intensely. When I met you, I disliked you intensely. Even now, I dislike you intensely- That is, the sensible, sane portion of me. But there's an insane side of me that gets a little violent Every time I think of you. Getting rid of a million-dollar lawsuit Wouldn't have anything to do With your change in affection, would it? You are a nasty creature, aren't you? But in time, I’ll beat it out of you. Reckon that's your date, honey child. I know why you're going to the ball. I also know that Sheila Lane is chairwoman of the entertainment committee And hasn't missed one of these affairs in 5 years, And she might show up. So you see, I’m going for the same reason you are. I'm going because I’m charitably inclined. If that's your mood, go with me. I'll let you pay the cab fare. Hello, Harold. I'll be ready in a moment. Very glad to have met you, Harold. Drop in again sometime. We'll have another heart-to-heart talk. I never thought I’d live to see the day You'd turn your back on the middle classes. How do you like it? On the expense account, They call it a disguise. This is the last place in the world I ever thought I’d run into a cop. When I get the time, I’m gonna resent that crack. Why don't you quit leading this double life? Go home to your wife. You know why I’m here, and I know why you're here. There's no ulterior motives in my charitable impulses. Yeah? I'd like to grab Sheila Lane, too. Hey, boss, I found out about that- He's ok. That was a tough job, but I dug it up. Covered every insurance company. George Lane left an insurance policy of $250,000. Hey, very clever fellow. Why didn't you come to me? I could have saved you the job. We knew that all the time. It's possible a wife would kill her husband for that amount of money. You might even call it justifiable homicide. But, Peter, the wife isn't the beneficiary. It's his partner Thomas. Thanks a lot, Jim. I'll see you in the office. It don't make sense to me. Thomas has got $10 million in the bank. Why would he kill his partner for 250,000? What makes you so sure he's got 10 million in the bank? That guy's as solid as the bank of England. He's got relatives all through the banking business. Why don't you subpoena his books and find out? Ain't I got enough trouble with Manton trying to get my badge? Do I have to get wall street on my neck, too? Any sign of Sheila Lane yet? No. Gee, how I wish I could get my hands on that dame. And you a married man, lieutenant. Tsk tsk tsk. Did you kill George Lane? What reason would I have to kill him? 250,000 reasons. So you knew about that policy. Yes. And you knew I was going broke. Stop it, Fred. I know too much to associate with you. Let's call it quits. You don't credit me with much intelligence, do you? What do you mean? That I know you've been carrying on with George Lane for months. That's a lie. And that you'll find it very difficult to explain Where you were the night George Lane was murdered. Helen. Come on. We've got work to do. I've got a date. Give me the crowbar. Shh. Give me the tools. Shh. If we get caught, how will we explain this? We're only doing the same kind of work They do here during the day. Shh. Shh! Shh! Echo. Thanks, Helen. What for? Helen... I... I don't think we're alone. Oh! Well, dopey. When did you get in here? I was here when you gently stole in. By the way, there's nothing in the drawer. I, for one, am glad you're here. Mrs. Benedict Arnold. Come here, Joe. I brought up an expert in safes. I want you to meet- Uh-Uh. No names, boss. No names. Are you a real crook? The last lawyer what defended me Said I was antisocial. I kind of like that better than crook. Don't you? Come on, Mr. X. Let's get to work. No. Not before witnesses. She's all right. That's the girl I’m going to marry. You know, a wife can't testify against her husband. Yeah, but she could testify against me. I could marry you. As a matter of fact, I’d prefer it. Oh, it looked to me like she was gonna marry you. Oh, I was only fooling. Of course I’m going to marry him. Yeah, but how about this other dame? I'm going to be his second wife. I'm raising the ante 50 bucks. Okey-doke. There she is. All right, Mr. X, get your photostatic machine ready. This may take a little time, girls. That's all right. We'll start planning Melsa's trousseau. Lay off the salmon. I hate it. Here's a certified profit and loss statement. My hunch was right. Thomas is in a bad way. I just can't believe he did it. You know, I like loyalty in a woman. And hate deceit. Get me that envelope. It's marked personal. It's none of your business. Anyhow, this is Lane's paper, And you're investigating Thomas. Give it to me. Go away. Go away. You bother me. Here's 1,000 withdrawn on the 8th. 1,000, the 15th. On the 22nd. Looks like 1,000 every week. Here's 20,000 withdrawn the day Lane was murdered. Mr. X, what does that smell like to you? Blackmail. Mmm. Very interesting. Maybe this is what cost him the 20 grand And that thousand every week in blackmail. Sheila was married to a convict named Norris before she married Lane. He's doing a 10-Year stretch right now. Here are the clippings on him. Oh. So Sheila was married to number 3572. Am I being paged? Hello, Eddie. Thought you were in jail. Got out a week ago. They knocked off a couple of years Because I was a good boy. Look here, Eddie. I had nothing to do with this. I'm just up here on a job. I got 100 smackers for it. Shut up, rat. Put those papers back in the envelope. You know, Norris, you've just done a stretch. If they nab you with that water pistol, You're going to catch an awful spanking. Toss it over. Stand there and toss it over. All right. Thanks. Cost you another 50 bucks. She's dead. She's dead! He shot her! Melsa, speak to me! Get some water. Melsa. Oh, Melsa, darling, please, please don't be dead. Here it is. It's all right. It's distilled water. What do you mean by calling me "darling"? Are you sure there's no hole there? It feels empty. It don't only feel empty, it is empty. If it weren't, you wouldn't be messing around In things like this. Oh, Hilda, you're fired. Please pack your bags and go and leave me to die here alone. Oh, my poor head. Hilda? Hilda! Oh, there's that mob again. Melsa, darling, how are you? Oh, girls, please, my head! Why didn't you take us along last night? We missed all the fun. What's funny about a bump on my head? I think it's beautiful. Getting wounded in the line of duty. Imagine, capturing a murderer. Well, he claims an alibi. "Edward Norris, held on suspicion "Of the murders of George Lane, Ronny Beldon, "And Sheila Lane, whose body has not yet been found, "Claims an alibi-Declares he was "With girlfriend Frances Glesk at hockey match "At time of George Lane's murder. "So far, attempts of police to locate miss Glesk Have proved fruitless." The police-All they know is to blow a whistle and tie up traffic. Y'all can't come in here. Oh, yes, I can! Get out of my way! It's all your fault. If you hadn't been there, he wouldn't have been nabbed. And all he wanted was the papers. Now they've tied him up with the killing. Sheila Lane doesn't mean a thing to him. Sure, he was married to her, but he loves me! He loves me! Gee, how he must love her. What did I do? Pass out? You're Frances Glesk, aren't you? Yes, and I’m risking everything coming here to you, But you got Eddie into this mess, And you're responsible for what happens to him. You've got to help me clear him. You're Eddie Norris' alibi. If you were with him at the hockey game, Why don't you go to the police? I can't go to the police. I'm a two-Time loser now. In order to do Eddie any good, I’d have to lie, And if they catch me, it means a life stretch. You're an unselfish sort of gal, aren't you? What do you mean, you'd have to lie? The only kind of an alibi I could give Eddie Would send him to the chair. He left me during the 10-minute intermission For a smoke. The cops would jump on that, and they'd- Wait a minute. That intermission wouldn't give him time To cross town and get back. I know the police. They'd railroad him on less evidence than that. Isn't that the usual claim? Look here, you. I'm telling the truth. You've got to believe me. Eddie didn't do it. He isn't that kind. I suppose those two guns he pointed at us in Lane's office Were paper-Mache. You didn't happen to know George Lane, did you? Only slightly. What are you driving at? Her alibi for Norris is also a perfect alibi for herself. Don't be silly. We all knew George Lane, But none of us killed him. I believe you, and we're going to help you. Come on, girls. We've got work to do. Hello, Hilda. Is Miss Manton in? No, sir. She done left for South America. Hello, girls. Came up to celebrate. Got a $25 raise. He offered me the money or new furniture in the office. I took the money. A raise? For what? Catching a murderer. Wasn't that a little premature of your employers? Norris hasn't been indicted yet. He's unquestionably guilty. He goes before the grand jury in the morning. Why, you- This is Dora’s cousin Ann Spaulding from Chattanooga. How do you do? Welcome to the game. Where did you say you were from? Chattanooga. Get the exact address. We'll send her an invitation to our marriage. What marriage? Now, don't try to crawl out of it. Helen witnessed your promise last night, didn't you, Helen? Congratulations, Peter. May I be the first? If I want to marry a fortune hunter, I can go to Europe and marry a professional one. I'm determined to make you happy If I have to drag your name Through the breach-of-promise courts to do it. You're from Chattanooga, where they have a higher sense of values. Don't you think I’m a good catch? Well, um, uh, I wouldn't know. You must know the Carlisles. Very old family, mint julep and all that? You know the Carlisles. Oh, yes. Yes. Ha ha! I must develop a taste for this stuff. Since we're being married And you've got plenty of money, we can afford it. A drink, miss Spaulding? No. She never touches the stuff. Thanks awfully for dropping in. Wait a minute. I'll show you to the elevator. Hello, everybody. Where have you been? Melsa and I have been getting engaged, And you weren't here. Engaged? I liked your cousin, even if she won't hoist a mug with us. My cousin? Yes, you know - From Chattanooga. She just got in. You are surprised to see here, aren't you, darling? Honey, how are you? Good-Bye now. Good-Bye. Oh. Oh! Could I use your phone? Thanks. Oh, dear. Hello? Lieutenant Brent. If I were you, I’d use a little more discrimination In the choice of my relatives. Hello, Mike? There's somebody up here I think you're very anxious to meet. Hello? Hello? Get him, girls. Hey, wait a minute, girls. Take it easy, girls. Look. Hello? Help! Stop! Don't! Aah! Hello? Hello, operator. Operator. Operator. Hello? Hello, operator. Operator. You've got him. All right, come on. Oh, wait a minute. There. That'll hold him. Come on. And the next time, we'll give you a black eye. This isn't play any longer. We're dealing with a man's life. The rest period in hockey games is 10 minutes. It's up to us to prove whether Norris could or could not Get up to the Lane house, kill a man, and get back in that time. I'm purposely making it the same time of night Because we'll be facing the same traffic problems. Helen, you take a cab; Myra, the bus; Kit, the subway; and, pat, walk as fast as you can, But don't stop at restaurants. All right, now start off. "While, with their usual enthusiasm, "The police were browbeating an innocent man, "Melsa Manton and her group of public-Spirited friends "Have unearthed a witness who substantiated Ed Norris' alibi." We're grateful for the chance to hammer the police a bit. You'll keep this off the streets for 20 minutes, As you promised? We're old-Fashioned enough to keep our word. I'm going down to the district attorney's office. They're going to indict Norris. Anytime you want a job as a reporter, come to me. I'd like to speak to the district attorney. He's busy. Mr. Ames and Mr. Brent don't happen to be in there, do they? I refuse to answer. I must see the district attorney immediately. I'll not be intimidated! Please sit over there and wait your turn. Yes, sir. Bring in that police report. Yes, sir. Norris, we're going before the grand jury in a few minutes. Why don't you write out a confession? You threatened to kill anyone that mistreated Sheila. Now, look, Norris, I’m your pal. Play ball with us, and I’ll get you off with second degree. Go away before I smack you in your stomach trouble. I must see the district attorney at once. Indeed? Well, young lady, The rule of this office is that you wait your turn. Yes? What's that? Oh, I beg your pardon. Bring in that file on Norris. Yes, sir. Why should I kill anyone? I've got a good job now, foreman on the new subway. I said I was going straight, and I am. Norris, you were known to have hated Lane. You were willing to murder me and several lovely young girls To destroy evidence. Whoa! Whoo! What is this, anyway? I didn't do anything. Where did you get this? Sir, I don't know, except maybe that young lady- Oh, it's you. See here, young lady, You can't do this sort of thing in my office. Here are the affidavits-The legal proof That the law of physics is maintained. One object cannot be in two places at the same time. Another paper prints it, It might cost me my job. That's all right, darling. I'll use my influence and get you on the W.P.A. Miss Manton, all the police ask is that you leave them alone. I suppose I should have left you alone. You had a very lovely suspect, And you probably could have proven, In your inimitable way, that he did it. The fact that he was innocent would never disturb your sleep. A man would die for it, and the real murderer would go free. As long as inspector Brent kept his badge. Isn't she wonderful? That's the girl I’m gonna marry. I'll take snow white. My advice to you is to find Sheila Lane And to keep that Manton girl out of your affairs. She's probably the kind of a dame That would come back to haunt me. Otherwise I’d shoot to kill. Hello, girls. Myra, it's about time you got here. I wasn't in when your message came. What did you want? We're looking for Sheila Lane. I don't believe she's been murdered. I think she's hiding from the police, Afraid because she knows too much. Now, of what was Sheila Lane the proudest? Her marriage license. She should have been, but she wasn't. Her red hair, darling. She was proudest of her flaming topper. She used the same beauty shop I do. I found out her hairdresser rinsed her hair In an imported preparation very few shops use. If that peacock is still alive, She's getting the stuff somewhere. This time, it's find the hair preparation, And you'll find the woman. I'm getting so scared, I’m beginning to see faces over my shoulder. If any of you girls feel like pulling out, go ahead. Melsa, don't feel that way about it. I hate the color yellow. There's no disgrace in being frightened. Oh, we'll stick. All you children run along now and get some sleep. You go on and get your shower, honey child. Myra, you take all the beauty shops along 8th and 9th avenue, From 42nd to 59th street. The rest of you girls know your routes. Melsa certainly wants her pound of flesh. Are you sure she doesn't want 150 pounds of it? Quiet, you carrion. Girls, girls. All they think about nowadays is men. And then again, why not? They make awful good thinking. Who there this time of night? I want to talk to Melsa Manton. You can't talk to her now. Why not? Because she's all wet. She's in the shower. Tell her she'd better not try to find Sheila Lane, Or she'll wake up one morning On the bottom of the east river. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I hear you. No, sir, I ain't arguing with you. Good-Bye, sir, please. G- Get me the morning clarion. "Number, please?" I don't know no number except policy numbers. You give me the morning clarion. You're being paid to edit. Your place is behind this desk. You'll get your money's worth. My place is behind this desk, and behind this desk I stay. Yes? Yes, Hilda. What? What? I'll be right over. Get lieutenant Brent at headquarters. Tell him to get over to Melsa Manton's apartment right away. I'll tell him why later. Yes, but you just said- Melsa. Melsa, my darling, what have they done- Hilda! Hilda! Oh, it's you. Darling, you're not dead. Are you disappointed? You gave me the fright of my life. Do you always sleep this way? Yes. Something will have to be done about it. I can't stand a fright like this every night. I assume you had a very good reason for bursting in this way, Or is it spring? That threat. That threat over the phone. I'm spending the night right here. In my lifetime, I’ve heard of a variety of subterfuges, But, Ames, you are superb. No other man in the whole world Could have thought of this. You're up to your beautiful hips in murder. You're fooling around with someone who isn't afraid to kill. Who is he? What are you girls up to? Wouldn't you and Brent love to know? Remember I once said I’d beat that nastiness out of you? You want me to start now? I'd better go. Hilda, you stay here. I'm not moving till the police get here. That man said not to bring in the police. Oh, all right. You can stay in the living room. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Oh, Hilda can sleep in here. All right, Hilda. Can you handle a gun? No, sir. I's a pacifist. You see? You want the lights on or off? It doesn't make any difference to me. Good night. May I have a cigarette? I've had dozens of cigarette lighters, but they never work. I use cheap gasoline. Maybe that's why it works. I guess so. Funny thing about streetlights- You never notice them. They're so bright-Constant, too. They were on last night and tonight. Tomorrow they'll be there again. Yes, I suppose the city is in a rut. I once smashed a streetlight. It was for a lady. She asked me to do it. I was 5 then, very much in love. Was she pretty? The cutest thing you ever saw. My parents thought we were too young To be thinking of that sort of thing, And they shipped her off to kindergarten. Whatever became of her? She's probably still in kindergarten. I couldn't live in this apartment. It's too high up for me. I've got acrophobia, you know - fear of high places. Oh. You sort of... You sort of get sick inside? Yeah, like I’d suddenly gone empty. Me, too. That's why I never go out on the balcony. I get that way riding in an elevator. Up or down? Up. I feel like that both ways. We have a lot in common. Mmm. All except the elevator. Melsa. Melsa. Yes? Melsa? What? I'm terribly worried about you. Please tell me who this man is who's threatening you. Who is he? Good night, Mr. Ames. I swear, I’m only concerned about you. Good night, Mr. Ames. Oh, no. I'm not going, not until- Hello? Melsa, I’ve found Sheila Lane. A small beauty parlor on a side street. The hairdresser didn't want to talk at first, But a $100 bill soon loosened her tongue. She described Sheila and said she was staying At the Hotel Ashton on 23rd street And that she called herself Sharon Lester. Well, what's the matter? Oh, is somebody there with you? Oh, well, look. Can you meet me down on the corner In about 10 minutes? Thanks, pat. You can stay here if you want to. I'm going to spend the night with pat. She just invited me. That was pat on the phone. You can't do that. You can't go out on the street, Not until Brent gets here. At least let me take you with me. Pete. Mike, I’m glad you're here. Peter! Peter! Come on. Come on. Let go of me, copper. Bat Regan! Well, who did you think it was, Kris Kringle? Why'd you do it? I'm class-conscious, see? I don't like society dames. I sent for the ambulance, chief. Ames is bleeding bad. Hey, chief, look. Here's what he threw away. Throwing away dough, huh? Sure. The depression's over. Things are humming again. You didn't happen to get this from Lane? Now, before you start lying, We got the numbers from the bank. He lost it to me over one of my roulette tables. There's nothing lower Than a dirty, murdering blackmailer. With my arms being held, you're pretty tough! Let him go. Ooh! Try to escape, huh? There you are. In a day or two, You'll be as good as new. Thanks a lot. Come on. Give. I'm hungry. Oh, boy. All we could get out of Regan Was that he got the money from Lane gambling. I think it was blackmail And when Lane threatened to go to the police, he killed him. Beldon saw it, so he killed Beldon. Why should he take a shot at Melsa? He says he was cleaning the gun, and it went off. Cleaning a gun in a car. It's Regan’s gun, And he insists it's his privilege To clean it wherever he likes. Now, I’m trying to hold on to Regan, But they've set his bail at 50 grand. Regan will have that up in 24 hours. Fine thing. Now, look, Pete. That Manton girl knows something we don't know. Otherwise, Regan wouldn't have tried to kill her. If he don't tell us, We'll have to get it out of Manton. Get something out of Manton? Don't make me laugh. This tastes too good to choke on. Pete... I told her you were dying. She's out there in the corridor Crying her head off for you. She is? That's worth dying for. Well, almost worth dying for. Listen. In the condition she's in, She'd even tell you her age if you asked her. You could get anything out of her Is she thinks you're dying. I’m sorry. You can't come in, lady. Oh, I must see him. I must see him! Let her in, Sullivan. Don't tax him too much. He's sinking fast. Golly. Oh, darling. Who... who is it? It's Melsa. What have they done to you, darling? They... killed me. The rats. Oh, no, they haven't. You'll live. You've got to live. You've got to get strong and well For your career, your future. Future? Future. Yes. Your future. Our future. You promised before witnesses That you'd marry me. You've got to live! Oh, I love you. I love you. Oww! Ohh! Ohh... The first death rattle. Oh! Who was it said, "Joy always comes to a man Too late." Oh, no. No! Pete. Oh! Pete, boy. Don't you want us to avenge you? No, Mike. I forgive everybody. That's what I call a nice guy. Even the rat who shot you? Even him, Mike. Wouldn't you... Wouldn't you rest just a little bit easier If you knew why he did it? Just out of curiosity? Oh, what good will it do? It's all my fault. Now it's too late. Mike, you know Melsa Wouldn't hold anything back From a dying man. Mr. Ames, Isn't there something I can do for you? Yes, Sullivan. Sing my favorite song for me... Home On the Range. Sure. ¶ Oh, give me a home ¶ ¶ Where the buffaloes roam ¶ ¶ And the deer and the antelope play... ¶ Never to see the sun again. ¶ A discouraging word... ¶ I don't want to die. I'm too young to die! I want to feel the rain in my face, The wind in my hair. I want to smell the good earth. Oh, Peter! Peter! We could have made sweet music together. "He rose like a meteor, flashed across our sky, And then was gone." Good-bye, Mike. I'm not gonna take this lying down. You're my friend, my best friend, And if it's no interest to Miss Manton, It is to me. I must have my revenge! Why? Why did Regan take a shot at you, Miss Manton? Why? Oh, we were looking for Sheila Lane. He threatened to kill me If I didn't stop. And did you find her, sweet? Yes. She's registered as Sharon Lester At the Ashton Hotel on 23rd street. Well, I’ll be seeing you. I mean... When my number is called. ¶ Home on the-¶ That's enough, Sullivan. Quite enough. ¶ Where the deer and-¶ Where's the phone? Around the hall. Down that way. Ehh! Oh! Oh! Oh. Oh. Are you still in pain, sweet? Oh, it's nothing. Nothing. Only when I move, but it's nothing. Peter, perhaps I did wrong In not telling inspector Brent everything. You mean you held something back? Yes, Peter. Oh, sweet, you're so clever. Remember when I went into Ronny Beldon's apartment? Yes, dear. When I went into the bathroom, I found something. In the bathroom? Yes, Floating around in a foot of water in the bathtub. Louder, dear. I can hardly hear you. I'll come closer. Tell me, dear. What was it? The Normandy, you black-hearted faker, in full sail! Oww! Why did you hide from the police, Mrs. Lane? I didn't hide from the police. I was afraid whoever killed George and Ronny would kill me, too. So I went to bat Regan. I used to work for him. I knew he loved me and would do anything for me, And it was his hotel I was stopping at. He hid me, Gave me the money to live on. Your husband's money. Blackmail money. Why did Regan help you blackmail your husband? Oh, please. Please. I told you I went to the old house After my husband was dead. Ronny and I had been meeting there. That's why you found my clip. Ronny saw my husband murdered, But he couldn't go to the police Without exposing our relationship, So he made me leave. He must have taken the body out While the Manton girl was calling the police, And then before he could get rid of it, he- He was... he was killed. So that's it. Beldon helped you murder your husband Because he found out about you two, oh, no. And Beldon loved you enough To get rid of the body for you! No! Then you murdered Beldon because he knew too much! Oh, lieutenant Brent, There isn't very much left in my life. I really don't care what you do with me. Do as you please. Take her back to her cell. Hello, Miss Manton. Glad to see you. Lieutenant Brent is waiting for you. Go right in. Come right in, Miss Manton. Oh, Miss Manton. I've been waiting for you. Won't you be seated? Is the chair comfortable? Very. Thank you. How about a pillow? Oh, no. Oh, go on. Go on. Now, Miss Manton, as you know, You've been a great help to us. Oh, yes, you have. We may have had our little disagreements, But then, who doesn't? Hello, Mike. Good evening, inspector. Now, Miss Manton, Just because you don't like Ames here, don't allow it To undermine the good work you've been doing. I didn't know you were going to be here. Brent sent for me. Now, here's the idea, Miss Manton. You saw Ronny Beldon come out of the Lane house, didn't you? Yes. Everybody knows you're mixed up in this. Collected evidence. Everybody suspects you holding out. Even I do. Oh, I’ll bet you say that to all the girls. Oh. Now, what would happen if we published the fact That you had just uncovered some new evidence Which is certain to lead To the discovery of the murderer And that you have an appointment With a district attorney tomorrow To turn over that evidence to him? I'd probably be found In a refrigerator. That's right. Well, isn't it lucky I didn't find any new evidence? Now, all you have to do Is appear in public with Pete here Where the murderer can get at you. First, I’ll surround you with police, Then release the suspects. Release the suspects? I'm going to Europe pretty soon. I'll be back in the fall, and then we'll talk it over. Now, Miss Manton. Mike, she's right. But there's a killer loose! Let me ask you something, Mike. If she was your wife, would you do this? Inspector, that's an implication that I’m his wife. I'm not. Yes, Pete. Because I think lots of other wives Have a right to live in safety from murderers. Now, how about it? Will you do it? No, she won't. I won't let her be a decoy. You won't let me? You're scared because he's asking you to be there, too. This proves there's insanity in my family. I'll do it. Thanks. But don't get the idea that we're friends. If I can still take your badge away from you, I’m going to do it. Just catch that killer, and you can have my badge. Release Sheila Lane. The rest of them are loose. Regan got his bail this morning. Now phone your paper to print the headline About Miss Manton finding new evidence. You scared? Because I am. No. No, I’m not scared. Hello. Ames. Get me rewrite. Extra! Extra! Extra! Extra! It's all right, boys. It was just a car backfiring. Rafferty from headquarters, miss. Don't worry. We're all around. Waiter. How's the terrapin tonight? I don't know. I'll ask the guy in the kitchen. Never mind. We'll take the dinner. Ok, coming up. Do you have Chablis 29? What's Chablis 29? What's the idea? Hello, Pete. Excuse me. Briscol from headquarters. Don't worry. Everything's under control. I'll get your chow. Wait a minute. Before you get those dinners, Is the chef from headquarters, too? Nah. Good. Dance? No, thank you. All right. Is it necessary for you to hold me so tightly? Of course, you make a better target by yourself. Why don't you draw red circles around me And rent me out to a rifle range? That wasn't the real reason I was holding you so close. It so happens, Heaven help me, I love you. You're taking an unfair advantage of me. The only reason I’m here with you Is because there's a gun in my back. Well, sometimes, that kind of wedding Turns out very successfully. I'm going to become hysterical in a moment. I've got the jitters. Isn't it awful? Get going! Line them up and search them! Get Pete! Where's Manton? Miss Manton? What happened to Miss Manton? Well, she was right - Hey, chief. Whoever it was got in and out Through a window in the hall. I just found the latch broken. He got Melsa. It's your fault, Mike. I'm gonna break every bone in your head. Did you get him? Oh, no, Miss Manton. He got away. Are you all right? Of course. I need a drink. I found this stuck on the windowpane. What is it? It's a hunk of tar paper. Maybe he's a roofer. Maybe you're a musician. 22 men, and all you bring me back Is a hunk of tar paper. Oh, uh, I’m an awful mess. Would you excuse me a moment? Will you quit crawling up on me? Melsa, let me take you out of all this. Wouldn't you rather wait until I’ve made up? Don't be afraid. I'm gonna stay right here. Nobody's going to pass me. Isn't that being a little selfish? Hello, Helen? Melsa. Round up all the girls and meet me in my apartment. Don't ask any questions. Just meet me. All right. This subway ain't open yet, miss. Oh, I’m sorry. The trains won't be running for two years yet The way we've been going. Oh. Well, you see, I- I own a lot of stock in the company. I thought I’d just come down and see how things were getting on. Oh, you're a stockholder. You got much stock? Sure. Uh, by the way, Do those things go very fast? I mean, could you go from here To, say, Madison Square Garden and back in 10 minutes? Do they go that fast? They sure do, miss. I got to walk, but once in a while, I do a little cheating- Steal a ride. Press a button, and zip! I'm there. Ah. Oh, uh, here. Buy yourself another pipe- One that looks less like a gun. Good night. Oh, Miss Manton. Mr. Norris. What are you doing here? I've been waiting for you. You know, I never did thank you properly For providing that alibi. Oh. Oh, that's all right. You're welcome. I, uh, I can't see you tonight. I won't keep you a moment. I assure you. Don't you think it's dangerous To be running around without police protection? I have police protection. Oh. I don't blame you for ditching them. Cigarette? Never smoke. Will you have a drink? Never drink. That's nice. Sit down. It's quiet. Peaceful here, isn't it? I'm tired and sleepy. Won't you excuse me? You look frightened. Maybe you'd better have a cigarette. Don't make believe you're not scared, because you are. Most people are scared of me. I'm not. As a matter of fact, I like you. You do? Well, I... I helped you. I helped your girlfriend Frances Glesk. Well, that was very nice of you, But Frances is just a friend. There's only one woman I ever really loved. Sheila Lane? Yes. I don't look like a lover, do I? Oh, yes, you do. Very much. I used to sit in my cell. You got lots of time in prison. Even if you work all day, there are the nights. Horrible nights. All I could think of was Sheila... Married to somebody else. But I really didn't mind because... I thought it was a great break for her being married to Lane. He was a rich guy, a banker. But did you know he used to beat her? No. No, I didn't. I hated that guy. All I wanted was to kill him. But when he was dead... There wasn't any thrill to look forward to anymore. Beldon saw me do it, so I had to kill him, too. But now when I think of it, it... It doesn't seem to mean a thing. I'm wondering how will it feel To kill somebody I like. You think that's strange? Yes. Very. I'm sorry to drag it out like this. I would have done it down at the subway When you found out how I got downtown and back so quickly, But there was that watchman. I don't think you'd better answer it. If you don't let me answer it, My maid will be in here. All right. Hello? Oh, Peter. Um... No. I'm all right. Well, I - I just didn't want any more policemen Cluttering up my life. No. Of course, there's nobody up here with me. All right. Good night, darling, and I... I love you very much. You better put your coat on. It's chilly on the street. But the police might be outside. I don't know just where Peter was calling from, But they had a lot of men surrounding him. I know that. They almost got me tonight When I took that shot at you at the club, But I was too smart for them. Are you expecting anyone? No. I'm not expecting anybody. If it's the police, Tell them you're going to bed. Repeat what you said over the phone. Oh, please go away. I didn't say anything. What about that "I love you very much"? What a- A gentleman caller. Melsa, are you two-Timing me? I ought to give you the beating of your life. You're lucky, Ames. She loves you very much... Like Sheila used to love me. Only you're lucky because you'll never have to torture yourself Thinking of her being married to someone else. What is all this? Tell him, Miss Manton. He killed Lane and Beldon. He used an electric handcar in the new subway To get there and back. Come on. Look. She gave you a break with the alibi, Norris. I give you my word. We won't do anything about this till tomorrow. Take a head start and beat it. If they do nab you, I'll play you up sympathetically in the papers. Go on. Don't speak to anyone. I don't want to kill an innocent bystander. You know, that's what I like about crazy men- That fine sense of distinction. You think I’m insane? Oh, he says that to everybody. In case I forget or... Maybe don't get another chance to tell you, I'm very happy to have loved you. Norris. Now, come on. Drop that gun. Stay where you are, Brent. You, too, coppers. Put it down, or you'll never get out of here alive. Well, if I don't, she won't, either. Now, Norris, use your head. Now wait a minute, girls. He's got a gun! Stand back, I tell you, Or Manton gets it. If you kill her, you have to kill all of us! Oh, you're always talking communism. Norris... Drop that gun. We're going through. You're not gonna get out of here alive. Go ahead. Ohh... Darling, it's all right. Hilda listened in on my phone call. She always listens in on my calls. She told me Norris was there, And we arranged everything. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't have a chance to tell you. Oh, darling, let me take you out of all this. That offer still holds good. Let's get married right away. Today? We'll go to South America for 6 months. Maybe we'll never come back. Can you afford it? No, but you can. Isn't there a drop of red blood in your veins? I want to live on your income. That's foolish. Who's gonna live on yours? Sullivan... My bicarb tablets. Will you quit crawling up on me?
