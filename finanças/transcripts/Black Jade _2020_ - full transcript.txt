These are statements giving a thorough breakdown of funds received as beneficiary. After state and federal taxes, naturally. Well, there needs to be a service. A memorial. Something. Child, you know how Mabel was. Stubborn to the grave and the beyond. No funeral buffoonery or any other vainglorious nonsense, she said. Lord will I miss that woman. You're right, Charles. May was never one for spending money on frivolous things. Least of all a funeral. That she was Dorothy. That she was. Well, would you like some tea? You've come so far. As long as it's sweet. Charles, is there another? You have a fine young lady sitting next to you, boy. Dorothy has grown up to be beautiful young woman. She's faced more loss n' pain than anyone her age should. Keep her close. Be there for each other. Not a day goes by that I don't wish I had started it by May's side. But I have no regrets. Loving her from afar was worth every bit of it. Worth more than all the roses of Charleston in springtime. Ray. Ray. Yeah, it's perfect. Good, I'll start the paperwork. She told him. 2:30 is fine. Period. Please bring the revised 9-4-1 forms. Period. Five W-4s still unaccounted for. Oh, and still waiting on Steven. Period. Have a good day. See you tonight. You too, Dot. Love you. Love you. Dorothy Sykes. Yes, Charles. I see. I'm so sorry, Charles. That sounds like something she'd do. Oh, I understand. Whatever time best suits you. Yes, I can imagine. I will. Charles, did she say anything? Of course not. I know she did. Thank you, Charles. Grandmother passed, I was named sole beneficiary. How much? Everything, everything. Dorothy Sykes. Oh my god! I'm so happy you picked up. Who is this? How did you? Hold on. It's 3AM here. No, of course you didn't. It's fine. I'm already up. Is something wrong? It's been a long time. Raymond, Delilah's here's. On my hands and knees, call me Adel! Raymond calls me Dot. He thinks Dorothy's too pastoral. Oh, there you are. Adel, this is my husband, Raymond. She scooped it up and pie, pie all the judges. Typical Dubois! Flora! Flora was there. Flora's like. She started screaming and crying like a baby. "Mommy my pie! Mommy my pie!" I hope she choked on an apple seed. And May, May didn't give a single solitary fuck! Mm! Always loved her style. That's not the best part. The best part right, oh my God! May said "I'm going to go console here". She walks up to Flora, gives her a hug. Says, "Flora dear, one day you'll be beautiful. So beautiful you won't be a little cunt anymore!" Stop. Stop it. You won't be a wittle cunt anymore! Where's the Dot? Mommy my pie! Mommy my pie! If you want some help I can lay out the silverware. Anything else and your kitchen would be in danger of burning to the ground. Whoa, oh my goodness! Are we close, Ray? Yeah, almost. I'm going to start calling you two Fred and Ethel. What do you mean? What the fuck? It's a TV show. I Love Lucy. Yes! Grumpy Fred. I can't believe you haven't gotten your man apron yet, Dot! No need, no. Here you go ladies. Straight from hell's kitchen. - Ooh! - Finally. Well, let's pray he didn't undercook the noodles this time. Dot doesn't like her pasta Al Dente. I love hard noodles. So, I want the whole story. How did you two meet? A holiday party. Willard Anson's house. Yeah, we did meet before but Dot doesn't remember. I remember, but you were shy and didn't talk to me. I was in a bad mood. It was a birthday party. Dot here was smoking a joint on the back porch. I'm in disbelief! It was such a boring party. Willard always threw the most boring parties. Yeah, she was talking with some other guy and I was in a bad mood. But she did leave an impression on me. Why were you in a bad mood, Ray? I forget. Do you get angry, Ray? I will if you let that pasta get cold! All right. So we started dating soon after. Six months later, he proposed. Jesus, that was fast. That's how it happened. So, how did you propose? After dinner we took a walk down Battery Park. And I went down on one knee and I asked her to marry me on the steps of the old Calhoun House. My favorite of those old houses, you remember? Yeah, she said no. God, I hope so. She asked me, she said "Ray, do you think a man should propose on one knee or two?" Wow! What a bitch! She didn't want a knight, she wanted a true believer. She gave you a litmus test, I'm fucking in love! Women want to be worshiped, Ray. I want to be used. How's the pasta, baby? Good? It's good. Cheers! To sisters. To family. Thank you. Fun night? Here, and takes these now. Did you have a busy day today? Mm-hm! Always. You? Yeah, same. You could always take some time off. Come on, we're not having this fight again. You've made your point. No, no, that's not what I meant. I meant this inheritance, it's time for a new start. More time for us both, right? Yeah, but I'm not quitting my job. You know I need to work. I thought that you hated your job? I'm gonna take the money and pay off our school debts, then reinvest half into the developments back home. I might put the rest in savings and set aside a little for something. You know I've I always wanted to see Scotland. Yeah, I guess you have it all worked out then. What did you expect? Did you think I was gonna stash it under the mattress? No man, I thought we could have a discussion. We just did. Oh, that's not a discussion. I don't know what you were expecting. We're a couple, Dot, we make decisions together, you hear me? Well you're mistaken, Ray. I decide what to do with my inheritance. And you're welcome for paying off your school debts. Fuck! You don't have to, okay? You can put it towards Scotland. Yeah, maybe I will. Maybe I'll burn it all on a much needed trips to the spa since I'm looking so fucking old and could really use the time off. We're out of milk. There's your fucking list. Why does Dorothy go to bed so early? It was 10:30. Why does she go to bed so early? I guess she's always been like that. I write over here and she goes to bed. If you need to go to bed just let me know and I'll stop. Mm! Don't stop. It's good. I'm out. Have fun with your book. Bugler slipped the edge of the desk with her gloves, stood up and staked out. Her face destroyed with fury. Hi, God, I need this. How was the audition? Meat inspectors. Have you found an apartment yet? I'm looking at one tomorrow, actually, Dorothy. It's asinine what an apartment costs here. That's why you research before moving. They can suck my dick. I'm gonna take a shower. Now she's in the bathroom. Marvelous. Let's go out on a date tonight. It's been forever. It's getting late, Ray. Somewhere close. Terry's. No! I'm not going to fucking Terry's. Check in the box. I'll be working late tonight. Doing what? Accounting's servers, they're being upgraded on Thursday. I need to back-up a few things. It's not automated? It is. But you know me. Yes. Oh, I'll also be in San Diego this weekend. Since when? Robert wants me holding his hand during the session so he doesn't look stupid, which he is. God, I hate San Diego. I don't know. I have a interview tomorrow. With? City College. It's close by. It's an ESL position. That's exciting. That's good. That's really good. That's a nasty bruise you got there. I haven't even noticed it. Use the striped tie I bought you. I'll be back late. Good luck. Oh my God! That's so gay. What? This is? You could just blow him then wear whatever you want. You talking from experience? Naturally. Love a giant cock in my mouth. How about we not put him to sleep. No, no, no, no. Try. No. Try. You see, Raymond, grey is classic. It's beautiful. And it looks good with your eyes. But most of all, gray conveys authority. On your knees. I want to strangle you. On your knees, I want to strangle you. Do you know what you're doing? Do you? Not exactly, never had to learn how to tie one of these things. Oh, daddy not around to show you? Something like that. I had an ex like you. You did? Yeah, he's dead. Is he now? I strangled him. He wants to have like, rough sex. Did you? All done! You working late again, question mark. Jesus fucking Christ! You creepy little shit! I hate surprises. So? How was the interview? "We'll be in touch". - Ew. - Yeah. So where were you all afternoon? I've just been wandering. Oh, poor baby. Come on. I'm meeting some friends. I don't know. I'm in a bad mood, Adel. Don't be a pussy-ass bitch, Ray. I have something to give you a lift. All right! Fuck it. Don't call me that. The night got away. I didn't move to this shit hole to hear your cunt-stained lips puke another "The night got away". Sorry for living instead of watching you trim the hedges while I drown the mediocrity of it all away. You don't get to use the word mediocrity. Look it up in the dictionary and learn about yourself. Or better yet, read that piece of shit you're writing. The only thing exceptional about you is how exceptionally flaccid your dick is. Well, I guess that's why you've been fucking your co-workers. Good morning. You were out cold. I feel like shit. The water will help. It's all my fault. Don't worry about that. Dorothy was really mad. It's my fault. Stop saying that. It was my choice. She's always hated me. She doesn't hate you. I understand. Such a hot mess. No, the mess is questionable. Women like Dorothy always hate girls like me. Those women. They secretly want to be us and we always wanted to be like them, at least admired like them. But we're trapped inside ourselves. Like one of those Russian dolls. Jump in. You'll feel better. Guess who made coffee. That's for me? Yeah, first successful attempt in the kitchen, not counting cereal. Yeah, it's good. Good? No, it's very good. Very? It's fucking good coffee. Fucking good! Yeah, it's fucking good. I aim for fucking good. Don't we all. So, how's your book coming? Yeah, there's a good flow today which is kind of unusual for me. What's the scene about? My protagonist, Rudy, he's kind of caught up in a love affair. Oh? Well, it's about a lot of things. A lot of things, huh? Adel! Shall we see. "The shimmering light of the pool danced behind her. Cautiously, she began to wave her jacket, then her blouse. Like the layers of a Russian doll, revealing more and more infinite complexity. Her firm body trembling ever so quietly as she gazed into my eyes, like a young doe in spring." Sorry. "The scar over her heart blazing like fire. I told myself to stay away, but I was never good at doing what I was told." How original. It's still defining itself. Discovering the characters gradually. It's clear to me he knows what he wants. Well, a character may know what he wants, Adel, but there's reasons for it. Internal, it's external, there's forces, it's why they do what they do, why they do what they don't do. I don't know, it's still, I'm just trying to find it. You like dancing in the fog, Ray? Avoiding dirty little truths. I shouldn't be showing this. It's a work-in-progress. Fine, I'll stop distracting you. Thanks for the coffee. And despite fact checks demonstrating there's no merit to it, he's still sticking to his claim that President Obama may not have been born in this country even as prominent conservatives tell him to drop the issue. What I am saying is there is a question. There's a bigger question now than two months ago when I first started. And he doesn't have a... He might have it and you know what, I hope he has it. Does your family what you to run? Are they encouraging you to run? Or they're saying "Don't run!" I tell you, it's very interesting with my family, whether it's Don or Eric or Ivanka or my wife, Melania, and I really think they'd like to see me do it, because they want this country to be great again. So I actually think in their own way they're putting the country first. What do you think you can do to really prove to people that you are serious, that you are a contender, and that you are presidential? I think I'm presidential. I think I have a very high aptitude, and I think was on the best schools and always did good, I was a good student. But there's only one thing I can do, and that's sometimes. Well, Trump has new allegations against president Obama, claiming he didn't actually write his first book, "Dreams of my Father." Trump also says he believes the constitution has a right to privacy which maybe. Should I put some clothes on? This tastes amazing. Mm! Grandmother's recipe. More wine? Wait! Wait, wait. All right. Oh! How was San Diego? I'm tired. I'm exhausted. Auditions must be strenuous. They are. Stiff competition? Yeah! Pretty stiff. Some more wine, baby. I don't want any fucking wine. I'd have some wine, please. Hey! Where were you last night? That's cute. That's really cute. Are you not talking to me? You just riding around. Can you stop! Where were you last night? Are you mad with me? Where were you last night? Just answer it. Don't be mad. Why won't you just answer me? Don't be mad. Just answer me. Don't be mad. Black sheep always returns, darling! Try living, Dorothy, try living Dorothy. You're a spoiled child. Pack your bags. I want you gone. Tossed aside again, typical. All your living and you're still the same-old, scared-of, self-entitled brat that never had the guts to grow up after they died. This martyr's ardor reeks of soured cunt. Stick with whoring housewife, a lot more chic. You would fucking know about whoring, wouldn't you? You have no idea. You still don't. But I'm sure you can read about it in a book, like the one your husband's writing. Breathe. Wake up! Breathe. Hey! You want more wine? Frozen pizza, Ray? Really? I'll take that as a no. Wasn't aware that we were still in college. My mistake. You don't like it you can make yourself something else. No, no. It's perfect. Absolutely perfect. I'm not your chef. That's not my job. What is your job, Ray? You just have to be a little more grateful, that's all. What is your job, Raymond? Here we go. I hope you happy now? Huh? You happy? Yeah, so happy. Every woman's dream to come home to a warm frozen pizza and a fucking man child. No wonder Adel left. Yeah. Make your fucking dinner. My hero. How do I look? Huh! That's weird. We use to share clothes all the time. She always had the beautiful things. How's that? When our parents died Grandmother took over. And she didn't like my demeanor. Were you a naughty girl? Listen, I don't want to fight, Ray. I was curious. I've always been curious. As a kid I would imagine being someone else. Anyone else. Did you ever wish that? No. I was given the name of a marriage counselor and I really think that we should consider it. Yeah! Our marriage is office chat now. It's a fucking joke. Get over yourself and just consider it. I would perform all the time. Drift around Battery Park for hours and hours. Meeting all kinds of people. People, mother and father and the lot of them didn't approve of, or even knew existed. A different character each time. With a name, a history, a cat named Violet. Most people like talking about the weather. Sometimes ideas. Dangerous ideas, once. I lost my virginity performing on those humid afternoons. It's my religion, you know. When I'm in character I feel, for a moment, like I'm in the presence of God and then I'm truly someone. I've made mistakes. I recognize that. It's not easy for Dorothy, taking on the burden of an unemployed husband. And I do want her free of that responsibility. I do. And I'm trying, I've been trying. It's not easy being married to a writer. It never is. But at the same time, at the same time, I feel trapped. I'm trying, I've been trying. It's not easy being married to a writer, it never is. I've made mistakes. It's not easy for Dorothy taking on the burden of an unemployed husband. And I'm trying, I've been trying. It's not easy being married to a writer, it never is. It's not easy being married to a writer, it never is. It's not easy being married to a writer. It's not. Yeah, I've made mistakes, but at the same time I just feel trapped. I feel trapped, I am trapped. I keep thinking of alternate lives. Possibilities. I wish I didn't, but I do. I do. And I wish I didn't, but I do. I wish I didn't, but I guess I do. My life is shit. It's dismal. I've made mistakes. Life is shit. Shit. It's dismal. It fades and diminishes and never to something better. It fades and diminishes and never, never to something better. Never. It's like a weak photocopy. It fades and diminishes and never for something better, never. It's like a weak photocopy. It's like a sliced apple once wet and crisp, now dry and shriveled in brown. I've made mistakes. And the flies, the flies, yeah this flies. This ideas buzzing around my decaying life. And I swat at them but they keep returning and returning and returning. And they keep returning and returning and returning and I swat at them but they keep returning and returning and returning and returning and I'm not special. I'm not. I'm rotting. I'm rotting. I'm rotting. And Dorothy is rotting. And you're rotting Doctor-calculated-risk. You're decaying. You're rotting. You hate sitting there. You hate it. You suffer the same diarrhea flowing from pathetic holes day after day after day. It's the same fucking story. It's the same fucking story. You suffer the same diarrhea flowing from pathetic holes day after day after day. The same fucking story. You're, rotting, you're decaying you vapid, self-righteous, bitch. But that's what people do. They talk it through. I've made mistakes. I've made mistakes. I'm wasting time sitting here but that's what people do. They talk it through. We're wasting time sitting here. This is what people do right? We talk it through. We're wasting time sitting here, but that's what people do. They talk it through. I've made mistakes. I've made mistakes. I've made mistakes. I've made mistakes. We're just wasting time. That's what people do right? They talk, they talk, they talk it through. We're wasting time sitting here, we're just sitting here talking, talking, talking, it's not fucking helping. Hold fast the iron clad! Hold fast the iron clad! Hold fast! Hold fast the iron clad! Cold, scared, primates clinging to clay feet of dead gods and all I really want to do, all I really want to do is fuck you in the ass. And all I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do is fuck you in the ass so you can shut the fuck up and listen to me! All I want to do is fuck you in the ass so you can stop doing that and just listen to me! Yes. Yes. Yeah! Yeah! Woo! How was your day? You don't have to watch me garden, you know. I'm sure you have more exciting things to do. No. More exciting out here, isn't it? What do you want? Who are you talking to? None of your business. It's none of my business. Don't touch my phone, Ray. What do you have to hide? This is my private space. Get out of it. Don't run away. This is good! We're talking for a change. Fuck off, Raymond. Who are you talking to, Dorothy? I'm just curious. None of your business! Moreover, you don't have the right to ask me that. You're no fun. Thanks for reminding me. Baby, I want you. I don't want to fuck you. What else is new. Ask yourself why. Don't have to. Enjoy your fucking shower. Fine! You want to see who I've been texting? Here's the fucking phone. No that's fine. Look at the goddamn phone, Ray. What's the point? Because you're being a paranoid little shit. Because you deleted what I wanted to see already. If you're fucking someone else, that's fine, just be honest. Okay? Just be honest. I'm fucking? You're projecting. Yeah, turn it all on me. Nice. Nice. You're hiding something. You're still not gonna tell me. Huh? Who have you been fucking, Ray? Who have you been fucking? Not you, obviously. Ray, who have you been fucking? Someone I love. Dorothy. Did you fuck Adel? You're crazy. Did you fuck my sister? Yeah, I did. I got the two of you confused. You fucked Delilah! You fucked Delilah! You were busy making- - You fucked Delilah! Oh my God! You fucked Delilah! My sister! You bastard! Don't touch me, Dorothy! It just happened all right? The night I got away! I'm such a stupid cunt! Where were you? Out late at the office? Again, and again and again. How many times? You're not gonna answer me. It's fucking hilarious! How many times did you fuck my sister? How many times did you fuck her you lying piece of shit? How many times? How many times? Two. All right? Twice, twice! Fuck! Goddam Dorothy! Oh, Jesus Christ! You fuck my sister. Raymond, get out. Get out! I'm not going anywhere. Get out of my house! It's our house! Get out. I said don't fucking touch me Dorothy! I told you not to fucking touch me. Get out of my house. I'm not going anywhere. Get out! Get the fuck out. Get out or I would. Dorothy! Dorothy. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm leaving you like May said to do a long time ago. No, you're not leaving me, Dorothy. Do not touch my things you fucker. I'm going to Robert's! His hag-of-a housewife is gone and he wants me. I'm taking my inheritance, which you motherfucker will never see a dime of, and I'm giving it all to him! Along with my cunt and my asshole and any other fucking holes he wants to fill. Do you get me, Raymond? Do you fucking understand? I'm sick of this shit! You're not fucking leaving me! Move away from me. You're not. Who's Craig? Who's Craig? Why did you fuck him? You fuck him too! Who is fucking Craig? Who's fucking Craig? Who? Huh? No, stop that. Help! - You're hurting me! - Stop it! Stop it. Silence, Dorothy. Silence. - Somebody help! - Silence. I love you. I love you Dorothy. Shh! I love you. What happened? Raymond, how do I look? How do I look? And what about her job? It's not like- - I'm sick. Yeah, and how long do you expect that to last, Adel? It's Dorothy, Raymond. This is not one of your fucking roles, Adel. Calm down, Ray. Don't tell me to calm down. It's under control. Just play your fucking part. I made a grocery list. Aren't you proud of me? Bye honey. Charles called. Tomorrow morning. God! He'll suspect. Relax, darling. He can't see you. He can't. What is this called? What? This. That's Black Jade. It's called Black Jade. Black Jade. These are statements giving a thorough breakdown of funds received as beneficiary. After state and federal taxes, naturally. Well, there needs to be a service. A memorial. Something. Child you know how Mabel was. Stubborn to the grave and the beyond. No funeral buffoonery or any other vainglorious nonsense, she said. I'm okay. Lord will I miss that woman. You're right Charles, May was never one for spending money on frivolous things. I'm okay. You have a fine young lady sitting next to you boy. Dorothy has grown up to be a beautiful young woman. She's dead. She's dead. Keep her close. Be there for each other. I'm okay. I'm okay. Loving her from afar was worth every bit of it. Worth more than all the roses of Charleston in springtime. What will you do Ray? I don't know. Don't know what? You don't know? Do you want to live Ray? Can you live with yourself? Can you live with yourself? Do you know what will happen to me? Do you know what will happen to you? I don't know. Can you live with yourself? Do you want to live, Ray? Can you live with yourself? You don't know? Can you live with yourself? I don't know. You don't know? Can you live with yourself? Can you live with yourself? I don't know. You don't know? You don't know? Do you want to live? Ray, do you want to live? Ray? Do you want to live? Ray, what happened to you? Do you want to live? Do you know what will happen to me? Do you know what will happen to me? You don't know? Do you know what will happen to you? Off to work. No, no, no. Don't. Don't, don't, don't. I feel so alive, Ray. We have to figure this out. No darling. Delilah Debois is dead. Maybe one day they'll be find her in a trash heap. Or she'll simply just disappear like all the other forgotten women. But today, Ray today is the performance of my life. I will go to work, hand in my resignation. Come home. You'll fuck me. Then we'll drive far, far away. Far away from here. And we can do great and terrible things. Just you and I. Are you okay boy? Am I? You look plucked. Yeah. I know. I miss her too. She's dead. She's dead. I know. I know. That's Adel. That's Delilah. What'd you do boy? I killed her. I killed her. I killed Dorothy. I killed my wife. Dorothy? You did what? I killed my wife. Sweet tea anyone? Jesus Christ! Oh shit! Stupid man. Jesus fucking Christ! Not my life Ray. Fuck yours, not mine. You're fucking insane. As billions of women before me, Man. Dot, Dot was right about you. Dorothy held your wet hand but I will strike you down with a smile if you fuck with me. Do you understand? Clean this mess up. Put it away. 911, what's your emergency? Help! Help! Oh my God! Jesus fucking Christ! - Help! He has a hammer. - No. No, she killed him. It's just a dead man and my wife. You don't know. You don't know. Somebody help! He killed them. He killed them. Hey man, keep back, just keep back. He killed them. Dude, stay back. Be cool. Hey, hey, hey, I don't want to get involved in this, but you keep back. Stay back. Back, back. Adel! Back off. This is not me. Back off man. You get the fuck back. It's not me. Get the cop. What the fuck is going on? The police. Keep me safe, keep me safe. Keep me safe. We got you. Ray. Ray. It's perfect.
