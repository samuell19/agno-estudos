[gentle music] - [Announcer] Here's our fourth runner-up, Miss Alfonso from Chicago. Let's hear it for her, ladies and gentlemen. [audience applauding] Our third runner-up in the 1967 Nationals, from Manhattan, Miss Crystal, ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for the third runner-up of the 1967 Nationals. - [Alaska] Well, I think the more compelling movie to watch is not when, okay, the end of the pageant comes, the winner is announced, and everyone shakes hands and oh, good job, good job to you. - [Announcer] But here is the only winner in the 1967 Nationals, that queen which will reign over America. Harlow, ladies and gentlemen, queen of the 1967 Nationals. - [Alaska] The more compelling movie to watch is the bitch who thought she should have won doesn't win and gets mad and rips the fucking wig off the other girl and storms off stage and throws a fit. Like Crystal LaBeija in "The Queen." - [Manila] It was a good film. She looked bad. Shit, she looked bad! And no way or what you say could do about it. Look at her makeup, it's terrible. Take a picture of me next to Harlow and tell me who's more beautiful. Oh, get a picture with me and Harlow and see which is more beautiful, darling. Now darling, I don't mean to take this out on you. You're a very lovely girl, you deserve everything lovely-- But she does not deserve-- But she does not look beautiful tonight! But she wasn't looking beautiful tonight. She doesn't equal me, look at her makeup. [Alaska And Manila] It's terrible! - [Crew member] They were reenacting pageant for a documentary. No, we were reenacting-- "The Queen." Andy Warhol's "The Queen." - [Crew Member] Phone that one, too. And her explanation for why she wanted the money. To put it in the bank. [laughs] It's all for publicity, darling, and that's why none of the true beauties-- That's bad publicity! None of the true beauties came, because they knew they wouldn't win, darling. Monique told me not to come, that's why Monique is not here in dress, because she is, Monique, darling. - [Person] She's a friend of ours. Monique was not here as a friend of yours. She is a friend of mine. [Alaska laughs] Oh, and I see you're running your camera, dear. Oh, you're not gonna use my name, no darling. - [Manila] You're not-- I'll sue the fool. That's fucking real. - [Sharon] Well, not for equal rights, just for extra. I want both bathrooms. - [Crew Member] Who's happy? Art and camera? Love it. I want a male bathroom and a female bathroom so I can rape your children. - [Crew Member] Take two. Season. I'm Sharon Needles and people may know me as the winner of season four of "RuPaul's Drag Race," or just America's biggest handful. - [Crew Member] All right, it's rolling. - [Crew Member] All right. - [Crew Member] Jinkx Monsoon, take one, marker. - [Crew Member] We're rolling. - [Crew Member] Rolling, please. - [Interviewer] So tell me your. - [Crew Member] No. - [Interviewer] Tell me your name and how you are known, what people know you for. My name is Jinkx Monsoon and I'm most well-known for winning season five of "RuPaul's Drag Race." [laughs] - [Crew Member] Man, I heard bestiality jokes on there. [Alaska laughs] - [Alaska] Right, they talk about like, fucking anuses and like, I don't know, fucking gay sex, I don't. - [Interviewer] Okay, last question because I'm sure. - [Crew Member] We should tuck a little piece of hair back in. [gasps] One piece of my hair is out of place? Burn all of the footage. [crew members laughing] I can't imagine! This is so funny to me because it's like, where is the line that it becomes like. Are you actually sticking to those? - [Crew Member] All of your managers want me to send you down, but okay. Where is the line that my ridiculous nest of hair, one part of it becomes, oh, that's too much, we have to stop. It's like, I just fucking put frizzed-out, ridiculous hair on the top of smooth hair. Where is the line that it's like, that's too much, it's out of place. We found the line. It's that one little stick-out. - [Crew Member] Okay, before I send you down. [Alaska laughs] Further request. Am I looking at you or the camera? - [Crew Member] Me. Okay, my name's Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 and I'm the queen of Earth. [laughs] So audacious. No, I've been saying that like, no. People know me, I'm a drag queen, I was on TV once. - [Crew Member] Did you-- [latex squeaking drowns out speaker] - [Katya] Hmm? - [Crew Member] Standard shot of the documentary, eyes on [speaks faintly]. Oh, no shit. I'm sorry if I was disrespectful to you in any way before. [latex squeaking] [crew member laughs] That kind of like, constantly irreverent thing does get old. Like, if you're just kind of a dickhead all the time, you know? [crew member speaks faintly] No, no, I mean. - [Crew Member] That's fine, we're working. [Katya rustling drowns out crew member speaking] There we go. I think I got it. Oh, it's a different color, fuck. [Woman With Floral Headband] Can you tell me, is it totally uncomfortable if your knees are right on here? - [Katya] You want me to kneel? [Woman With Floral Headband] No. Just put your legs back over. Okay, oh, I see. The image was too seductive. They're not even gonna listen to what I'm saying. Barbara, we're looking good. We're good to go. Get the horse dart out and just shoot her in the neck. Is this a romance book jacket photograph? I'm trashy but thoughtful, mm. What about this? Yeah, I wonder where my wheelchair went. This'll do. I don't know, I've never done drag though, 'cause I'm a woman, biologically, from birth. Came out a woman and still that. Sound like a man. - [Interviewer] So is that-- What would you do if I pulled down my pants and had a beautifully-manicured vagina?

[laughs] It takes so long. I love the final product and I love the way I look in the end. I just hate the process. Doing this six nights a week, covering yourself in makeup and painting yourself, it just gets a little tedious. Other times when makeup artists have tried to do my makeup, I'm really unsatisfied with it in the end because professional makeup artists who do like, fashion editorial makeup and stuff, when you ask them to do a drag queen's makeup, I never think they put enough makeup on. And there's some drag queens out there who can just wear a little bit of makeup and go for the more natural look, but I really just don't like that on myself. I like to look like a full transformation, facial reconstruction has taken place. [laughs] Let's say all these front bright lights, instead of 50%, let's just cut these. We'll take, yeah. So we can walk on in this kind of dramatic. - [Crew Member] This is the preset. Yeah. Mine's soft lights. Yeah. So let's leave it like this until we get center stage. So you kind of just barely see us in this light. Then when we hit center stage, that's when you can bring the lights up, maybe we'll start 'em at 50. Actually, right there, that's great. Just kinda dim. 'Cause we sing "O Holy Night" and it's really somber. ♪ O holy night ♪ The stars are brightly shining ♪ Drag queens, they say whatever is on their mind and they don't give a shit if it's politically correct or if it offends people. You know, drag is a satire and a social commentary. The character of Jinkx is supposed to be kind of boozy and alcoholic. I like to make jokes like I'm drunk even if I'm not, because then if something goes wrong, well, you can blame it on being drunk, even if you aren't, you know? [laughs] And then they kind of expect that out of a drag queen. Normally, a drag show is just in place to try to sell more booze, so it's like, kind of just expected that the drag queen's gonna be drunk, so I kind of just give them what they want. Like when I started drag at age 15, lots of people acted like I was the most negative stereotype of the gay community. And now, thanks to there being a reality TV show all about drag, drag queens are respected in a way that they really weren't when I started drag. ♪ Divine ♪ Oh, now ♪ Oh, now ♪ Oh, now ♪ Ho, now ♪ Baby ♪ O night divine [audience cheering] [audience applauding] I saw my first drag show at age 14, and I feel like it changed everything for me.

So when I was like, well if people are gonna just assume that about me anyway, then I should stop worrying about playing this game. It was trying, for a lot of time and it was hard to go through the American public school system like that, but the more that I just kind of realized, you know, there's no hiding it with me and I'll be so much happier when I stop trying to hide it or trying to be someone else, the better my life got. ♪ Someday you'll meet another gal who'll throw you away ♪ ♪ And she won't feel sorry ♪ Nearly as sorry as me Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my friends, Oscar Wilde and Teeth. [audience laughing] I mean, look at those teeth! Jinkx is very heavily based on my mom. My mom doesn't like that. [laughs] I don't know about you, but I would be very embarrassed to have fake teeth at such a young age, you know, I would, I would. Oh, shit. [audience laughing] Oh, dammit. I'm not trying to say my mom was a terrible mom. She had plenty of great moments. But she also caused a lot of problems for me in my teenage years. My mom went through a phase of alcoholism and went through a phase of just being very selfish. And my way of working through that frustration was to create a character out of it. Mom, I can remember the words. I'm a professional. The reason I'm able to be a positive person and able to keep my mind focused on, you know, improving the world is because I get all of my anger out on stage. But there are plenty of people out there who do not adhere to one strict gender, you know. There are people who are genderless. There are people who, they prefer to be referred to as genderfluid. They prefer to be referred to as gender non-binary. They prefer not to be referred to at all. [audience laughing] Yeah, friends, I prefer not to be referred to. Yeah, it's very awkward when we go to parties. I have to say, "Have you met my friend?" [audience laughing] And we have to respect that. We have to respect it. We have to respect it! I, myself, I'm much more enlightened than most of you. For me, the best thing is when I'm fully done with makeup and people, it used to happen more before I was on TV, but people would think that I was a real woman trying to be a drag queen. Like I was a real woman painted up and trying to impersonate a drag queen. And I liked that because it made me feel like I had fully transformed into a character where people really didn't know if I was a boy dressed as a woman or a woman dressed as a woman. [upbeat music] I cannot become any more masculine than I am now. ♪ Coffee and wine The older I get, the more I'm going to start looking like a man, and that thought terrifies me. My ability to shift between the genders is the thing that's kept me from hating my body. We have been conditioned for so long to believe that because of your genitalia, it's natural for you to act this way or the other, and to do anything outside of that is unnatural. It used to drive me nuts trying to feel confident and feel good about myself dressed as a boy, because ding-dong, I'm not a boy. You know what, that's not my inner truth. ♪ Coffee and wine ♪ To give life meaning I feel a responsibility, not just as a drag queen but as a gay celebrity. You have to be awake, if you want to be an artist and not just someone pushing booze. I have a much younger audience, fan base, than I ever expected. There's gotta be some substance and there's gotta be something going on in the show so that that 14-year-old boy in the audience who's seeing their first drag show, I wanna make sure there's something that they can take home with them, that means something. ♪ Keep me in the java ♪ And [audience cheering] ♪ Wine Oh, thank you, thank you. Well. So. What happens is, is that when you're in drag, you take your penis and your nuts, and you squish them in your hands and then you pull them all the way back between your legs and stuff them up in your butthole. And then you put on a pair of like, a fucking roll of duct tape, and five pairs of panties which are seven sizes too small, and then you sit around in six pairs of tights, in high-heel shoes, scrunching your toes, and then you put a wig on your head, which is like a thousand degrees and it's on really tight, and then you have a face that feels like you have a clay mask on. And then when you're sitting around not doing anything for several hours, it starts to get annoying and painful. And then you have a diva fit. Hey, can we set this fucking shelf, please? I'm fucking over it. - [Person] Michelle, can you start the show? Can someone start the fucking show? We've been fucking waiting around. It's like fucking 11 o'clock, and we haven't started the fucking show? All right. Well, fuck! - [Person] You sell my T-shirt. [Ivy speaks faintly] - [Manila] I didn't sign one single fucking headshot. - [Interviewer] In a lot of the-- [burps] Sorry. It's the corset. [gentle music] We're like witches in more ways than one. If you've ever seen the Anjelica Huston movie "Witches," where she's like, "You may remove your wigs," and they all pull off their wigs and they have these horrible bald heads. They kick off their shoes and they have these big block feet. It's like, that's about drag queens. I mean like, half the extras in that movie are men dressed as women and I think Roald Dahl in his infinite wisdom just knew [laughs] what it's like to be a drag queen and wrote a book about it and called it "The Witches." As glamorous as this all looks, it's fucking painful. It's really painful. To create the hyper-Western concept of the perfect female form, we are constantly suffering from fever. Our bodies are constantly confined by spandex, which causes us to get very hot and to sweat a lot. And then all the things we use to manipulate our bodies into the female form is absorbing all of that, so the most beautiful drag queen, just right underneath their crust, is nothing but disgust. When I'm super busy in drag, I don't shower with any regularity. It's like pulling teeth to get me to take a shower. When you're on the road and you're doing show after show after show after show, you don't have washing machines to wash your tights, so-- So, it looks really lovely, but like, you're really glad this movie isn't in smell-o-vision, 'cause it's like-- Eventually you start smelling like Gouda and corn chips. Chicken for a few days and then it starts smelling like something is wrong. We smell like bile. Like, filth. Like a mole person. Like it could get somebody else ill. We're disgusting. I can't believe anyone fucks us. [mysterious music] [audience cheering] ♪ Once upon a time ♪ Science opened up the door You know, I get put into a box of being a horror queen or an Elvira.

Yeah, this shit should be illegal. We are designed for the night. [phone ringing] Oh, God. Thank you so much, it's my Halloween costumes. Feel free to try them on if you want. Thank you so much, bye. - [Interviewer] Do you have alts? For Halloween, never. I'm the fucking queen of Halloween. Well, once Elvira dies. - [Interviewer] But I'm looking at your toenails and I'm concerned. - [Sharon] You should be. - [Interviewer] Is that from dancing? This is just old black nail polish, but our pantyhose constrict toes so much that they're full of callouses and corns. The what to wear's always difficult in a day gig. - [Interviewer] Why? Because I think costumes on drag queens during the day looks dirty. It looks, I mean, it sounds oxymoronic, but it looks too much. In a spotlight you look like Barbie, and in the sunlight you look like a birthday cake. I did find a bag of cocaine in my [laughs] toothbrush bag though today, which is kind of a shock. Did you fly with it? Oops. - [Interviewer] Oh my God. I don't know anything about that, Occifer. The fun about drag is that you can escape yourself in a million different people. I'm every woman, they're all in me. Oh, day gigs. It's just not right. [upbeat music] [audience applauding] [audience cheering] The great thing about Pittsburgh is that they don't give a fuck who I am, you know? Right after "Drag Race" it was a sensation for maybe an hour. Why the fuck you all up this early? [audience laughing] This is torture. After "Drag Race" I had the opportunity to move to Los Angeles like a lot of my "RuPaul's Drag Race" sisters do, or New York, or you know, even get out of the country, but I look at Pittsburgh the way John Waters looks at Baltimore, because it's like an escape from all of this, you know? [audience laughing] Would you like some of my vodka, though? - [Audience Member] Sure. When I say that's a whole glass of vodka, I'm not lying. Go ahead, have a little sip. Pittsburgh's just an old industrial town where you can still smoke in the bars, and I love that. So I dropped out my freshman year. Well, I didn't really drop out, my counselor brought in my parents and said it might be best if I left the school because my visuals were a distraction to the other students. So I left high school, then I came to Pittsburgh. [energetic heavy rock music] We were just a group of misfit Pittsburgh drag queens. We became successful quite quickly because I think what we were doing on stage was reflecting who they were. It's a rough, sloppy, rusted industrial town, so I think they liked that we were rough and punk and more in-your-face. You know, it was never just a pretty dress and the lipstick, you know, there was always a political, a transgressive, or a hyper-art side to what we were doing. ♪ Hail Satan Just because we're drag queens doesn't mean we all come from the same pasts and we're on the same path. I didn't want to be RuPaul, I wanted to be Divine. You know, I was introduced to drag by being something really bonkers and scary. I call it visual terrorism. 9/11 in high heels. Gay people are the one minority people don't really fear. They can scare normal culture and that's fun, and needed. Red wine before noon is gross. Not gross enough not to drink. Not a real drag queen unless you have no toes and they're spilling over, ready to commit suicide. It's called a suicide toe. Ready to jump. How clockable is this lace today? Like, right up on it, yeah, you can see it, but if you move away you can't. It's a classic lace, then? Yeah. Okay. I don't wear costumes in a day gig. A full face of makeup, of course. I had the best night's sleep last night, though. You got in last night? Got in last night, watched this documentary about child sex offenders. Oh, I bet you were in heaven. I was like, "Oh, why is this on A&E, "they're not describing enough." Now if I found a time machine and I had sex with my six-year-old self, would that be illegal? Six-year-old? [laughs] I wasn't even that cute at six. Not like-- You had only had half the procedures done by then. You wanna go to a pageant tonight? Sonique is performing. Is it in this town? No, it's in downtown L.A. I have a 5:30 a.m. and it's Chad's-- But it's a T-girl pageant. I know, I know, I know, I know. Caitlyn Jenner-- Caitlyn Jenner is gonna be judging it. I'll be there. [laughs] My shoe is slowly filling up with blood. [Alaska laughs] Oh, day gigs. My foot fell asleep. This is corporal punishment. Can we get a golf cart? - [Sharon] Or any sport cart. - [Alaska] A go-kart. A big wheel. If Caitlyn Jenner was here we'd have a golf cart. Think it's the only thing she's legally allowed to drive nowadays. - [Driver] Sit on the outside. Maybe not. Okay, this is like the Flintstones. I'm like the fucking steak in the Flintstones, girl. Oh my god, how tall am I? I'm the tallest person I've ever. You good? Yeah, I think so. - [Sharon] I need that mic wet, wet, wet. Wet as can be. - [Alaska] Yeah, give me as much reverb as you can. Reverb to the point of echo. I don't want that, though. Tell them to shut it off. [heavy bass music] [audience member screams] Every time I get ready and I look in the mirror I always say, "I'm never gonna look better than this," and then one year from that I'll look back at that and I'll be like, "Oh God, what was she thinking?" Then think that is the current standard of perfection. It's never gonna get any better than that. If I think I ever felt like there was no more growth in this art form then I'd probably quit. ♪ I'm not alone I like it to just reflect the insanity that's going on up here. Then it also proves to be very therapeutic for me to perform it live, because I think the stage is a great punching bag. [laughs] I mean, it's more legal than killing people. ♪ You're casting your spell and I'm hypnotized ♪ ♪ You're a hellhound I don't have the most fans, but I think I have the best fans. People who are fans of Sharon Needles are usually introverted and damaged in some way and I most definitely put that in my music and in my songwriting. ♪ You're my Dracula, la, la, la, la ♪ [audience cheering] Happy Halloween, hail Satan, and as always, kill your parents! Is there anywhere for Grandma to sit? - [Woman] [laughs] There's a bench over here. How've you been, I haven't seen you in a while? [Fan With Pink Hair] I know, since 340 I think? Yeah, since 340. Yeah. Did you guys enjoy the show? Sorry it was so short, but you know, that's festivals, you know? It was nuts in there. - [Sharon] They throw you on and they throw you off. But the sound was really good. [Fan With Pink Hair] No, it was great. Yeah, now I have to pack up real quick, grab all my Halloween costumes for my tour, just got sent in at the front desk, and tonight I'm meeting one of my all-time biggest icons. [Fan With Pink Hair] Which one? You'll never guess. [Fan With Pink Hair] I probably won't. Guess, Caitlyn Jenner. [fans gasping] You're not. Oh my god. - [Man] Say that again. I love her, Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner! Oh. Where are you meeting her? One of my biggest icons that I really identify with. You know, they all love it at first and then change their mind real quick. [all laughing] I don't wanna call her an idol because there's nothing about her that I want to be, but she's certainly one of the biggest icons of our current time. You ever seen a transsexual be so hated on? It proves that transgender people are just like us, we can hate them. Times. I hate everyone, so. - [Fan] 'Cause people think they're doing it for attention. They are a-changin'. Happy Halloween, guys. Bye, Aaron. Thank you so much. Tell all my babies hi. I will. I'm still looking for your ice pops but I think they're discontinued. My what? Ice pops. My fans know that I have an obsession with ice pops. And cocaine. - [Jiggly] And you're not even with a drag queen now. False eyelash, shit bitch. - [Sharon] It was their cool mean girl table and then me, The Princess-- It was not the cool table! And Madame LaQueer. Let me ask you a question, like a witchy question. Do you think of me as a friend? Yes, of course, I think of you as one of my best friends, actually. Good. One of my best sisters. Good, then we're on the same page. I thought I wanted to fuck him but I know that that's just never a good idea with us because I have a hard time maintaining an erection for people I respect. [gentle music] Yeah, I mean, I always say if I didn't use dating apps, if I didn't use Grindr, I wouldn't meet anyone, because literally when I'm on tour the schedule is, get on the plane early in the morning, get to the hotel, maybe have a couple hours to nap or eat, then immediately start getting in drag. So I meet promoters and I meet like, other drag queens and I meet go-go boys and stuff, but I don't meet many real people who aren't in the business these days unless I use a dating app. I've realized it is a lot trickier, especially because gay, I always forget about that. It shrinks the population down. If they know me, do they only wanna hang out with me because they're a fan? Sometimes I meet guys who don't know me and they just really don't get it. I try to explain my career to them and they have zero idea what I'm talking about. [laughs] I'm starving for affection, Sharon. Nobody will fuck me. Oh my god! That's not true. Well, don't sound desperate. Yes it is true, are you gonna fuck me, bitch? I don't think so. Is Jiggles gonna-- Violet was tweeting that she wants to fuck you-- For the fame. Is this bitch gonna spread her fat rolls all over my beautiful fucking body, bitch? You leave my bakery alone, bitch. Are you gonna fucking stuff my hungry mouth with your delicious Asia rolls, bitch? No. Go fuck yourself. Leave her sweet buns out of this. That's kind of what it is, it's like, all right, that guy looks like he could test the challenge of my whims in changing and like, ridiculous expectations on every level. That's gotta be a really special person. Who's gonna graduate from the university of my pussy, summa cum laude, and gonna donate to the alumni fund? Not a lot of people at this, you know, small, unaccredited college in the mountains. [laughs] You gotta let nature take its course. Will you give me a kiss? Jiggles? Nope. - [Katya] Lift your fucking mouth. No! Kiss me. Kiss me. No! That is rape. Kiss my gross-ass smoker mouth. That is rape. No, I'm saying kiss me. Rape! What can I do? No, don't shout rape when you're not getting raped. [Jiggly and Sharon laughing] That's a lie, kiss me. Kiss me, you fucking fat bitch. No, I don't want his curse. Why? 'Cause I'm not a lesbian. Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me. I'm not gonna turn around. I'm gonna endanger this whole vehicle until you kiss me. Oh my God! Give her a sweet little sister peck on the lips. Are you not my fucking sister, bitch? Okay. [Jiggly and Katya's lips smacking] Thank you, God. Now we'll do it on the lips next time when my dingaling's out and hard. [Sharon speaks faintly] How the fuck you doin', London? [audience cheering] Listen, I'm a junkie and I'm not gonna apologize for it. I'm also growing out my hair. Does it look nice? [audience cheering] Thanks so much. Listen, the holidays for me are all about, you know, good food, great relationships, and then, well, trying not to fuck my dad. And it's hard, you know, 'cause he's a really handsome guy, but that's neither here nor there. - [Interviewer] These days, would you say that you're straight-up just a comedian? No, no, no. I'm an auteur who moonlights as a romance novelist, but just hasn't written any books yet. Listen, something they never teach in school no more is that when Dorothy went to Oz, she had to have sex with the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, but the Lion wouldn't fuck her 'cause he was gay. Did you know that? Wait, are you 14 years old? Fuck. I feel like I'm just a Jessica Simpson with the heart of Bill Cosby and the legs of Jackie Joyner-Kersee. That's not true, I don't know what that means. ♪ I had a shot of Vicodin Wait, what? What the fuck is that? I mean, I don't know, do you think, I mean, I'm not a comedian. What do comedians do? They have specials for one hour where they wear a boring outfit with a microphone and they say, "You guys, when I fuck my wife's pussy "it just goes split, splatter, splatter. "It makes all these splashy noises, "and I don't know how to feel about that." I mean, that's every comedy special I've ever seen, but you know. I don't know. I like making people laugh but sometimes I know, it's not that I know that I'm funny, it's that what I'm saying is interesting and I know that, even if I'm in a room, I'm just in the wrong room. But I know there's a right room. Happy New Year's to you. They say new year, new you, and I have three New Year's resolutions. I wanna find my dead cat and give it a proper burial, I wanna call up Denise on the phone and say I'm sorry for calling her a cunt in front of her dead mom, and the last thing, I gotta start flossin' again, but it's hard. - [Interviewer] A satirist? Can we try? No. You're so hung up on labels, why can't I just be a woman? Don't put me in a box. You can put me in a shopping cart but not a box. That's comedy. [laughs] You guys should really think about not drinking so much. Good night! Which witch is which? All right, so I can actually not sing, but I like to sing in characters. - [Jason] Good. Could we do like, ♪ Camptown races sing that song ♪ ♪ Doo-dah No, seriously. Yeah. Like, old timey. [sings in gibberish] Yes. Okay. Am I playing this? Am I playing and we're singing? Is that what's happening? I don't know. We're gonna be eating sushi, too. Amen to that. Did you go to college for like, performance or anything? Yeah, performance art. For real? I used to be embarrassed about it and now I'm literally making thousands and thousands of dollars to do it, so I'm not embarrassed anymore. [Jason laughing] But it took a long time not to be embarrassed about it. What'd you do, did you do stuff at like, ART? No, no, no, I did stuff like this. Like in a '90s beat, I'm like, huh, huh! [Jason laughing] That's it, to like, dentist drills. Just C-curve central. Like to dentist drills. No, actually, we're digitizing footage from my stuff I did in school and it was actually, looking back, it's kinda cool. - [Jason] Yeah? But so I am in the weird transition part where I'm famous for being a person and now wanting to be famous for being an artist. When Hollywood makes you, your grip snaps like a twig on real and not real, important and not important. - [Jason] Yeah? You know, that scares me to death. You know, generally speaking, well, I feel like a lunatic sometimes, but other times I feel bad, I don't give a shit I feel like a lunatic, and then I wanna retreat and just maintain, and I hate that. It's insidious 'cause guess what allows that kind of retreat, money. - [Jason] Sure. Eccentric people are eccentric. If you're homeless you're just crazy-- - [Jason] 'Cause they've never had to fight or do anything more. If you're eccentric with no money, that's crazy. No, crazy with no money is just crazy. Crazy with money is eccentric. - [Jason] Yeah, that's it. But you have to be functioning to be eccentric. Like, you have to actually, meet at 7:00, you gotta show up at least by 8:00. [laughs] You know what I mean? Or otherwise, people cut you loose. I have to be a clown or like, a goofball goon because there's no other way to do it. It's so grim! Look at me, I am an insane person. Thank God this is happening because it legitimizes it. ♪ Jesus Christ But fuckin' eh. Barbara, I call you back. It's like, nuts. That's why I feel like, oh, whenever I feel like, I wonder if this is what Robin Williams was like, 'cause he's so manic and crazy and probably a cocaine addict. He's like, "Hanging it up!" And then, boom. Hanged himself. Still like, getting over body shame stuff. But it's society though, why is it a crime to be naked? It is a crime to be naked. I think the Vatican needs to pay because all of my body shame issues I've been able to like-- Trace back to your Catholic roots? Yeah, and like, get to a level of objectivity that's kinda realistic. You know, it's never gonna be totally objective if it's me, but I'm able to see the same pattern in lots of other people. Mama, those people put me. The Holy Trinity is not Father, Son, Holy Ghost. It's fear, shame, and guilt. You know what I think, my job going forward as an artist is to incorporate some element of nudity in every single thing I do, because it's gonna take that much to make just a small dent. Because there's nothing objectively wrong with me being naked. Permeating everything else. Here's my twist. I have to love my body because I hate my body. If I didn't hate my body I'd be at zero. You wouldn't know. But hate is minus five, love is plus five. We're trying to get actually to zero. Because my body is not gonna be lovable forever. My body, if I don't shower three days from now, will be disgusting. It'll smell like shit. Not a value judgment! Not a value judgment. In the Catholicism they say, "Your body is dirty, you are worthless." Every time. You are naked, you are ashamed and afraid. Garden of Eden, mama, it starts in day one. The knowledge of good and evil equals being shamed of your body. The first thing you're aware of is, I'm naked and it's wrong.

Come on, we gotta-- Do you guys know if there's any drag queens who are Trump supporters? Yeah, my friend Amy Vodkahaus, from the original Haus of Haunt, voted for Donald Trump. She's very proud of herself. Is that like a subversive kind of dig, or? No, she's Bosnian, so she's got her Hillary Clinton issues. Everybody's got their Hillary Clinton issues, mama. Yeah, yeah. - [Interviewer] But how did you guys feel the morning after the election? Oh God. Next thing you know they're gonna wanna film the drag process. With closeups of our feet. Do you wanna see me getting into drag, it's fascinating. You wanna see the juxtaposition between beauty and ugly? How about me in a sequins gown at the dump? [Katya laughing] The subversion of it all. The transgressive ideology. Can't host, can't host. Wait, say it. How long have you been. [laughs] How long have you been dressing? How long have you been dressing? Looking for other sissies who like to dress. I have a Dolly Parton wig, champagne teddy. I keep it in an oak hutch. [both laughing] I keep all my teddies in an oak hutch. Mother always said, "Too much for the hutch." [Katya screams] All right, I'm going to work. We're gonna get in trouble. We didn't even get cigarettes. [audience cheering] My name is Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova, but you can call me. - [Audience] Katya! Barbara, you fucking idiots. [laughs] Hi!

These were custom, so I like, went in, I talked to them, I like, I don't want a full wig, I just want the piece and then a big thing that I can just pop on top. So they did them, they're very beautiful, and very large. This is my RuPaul statue. I bought it when they did the limited run of them and I had to have one so I bought it. It's one of my prized possessions. I keep wigs on the stove, just 'cause they're big and I don't really have anywhere else to put them. - [Interviewer] I'm thinking maybe the stove doesn't get turned on a whole lot. I don't, I do make tea, but that's on this one. But the rest, I mean, I don't know, yeah. I don't use the other ones. This is the spare room where I just put drag. This is what I'm gonna wear tonight, though. It's like, long and poofy at the bottom. I'm really excited. This is a fox. Oh, here, this is me on Christmas and this is my dad. I look to be opening some sort of Hot Wheels cars or something, which I loved. [gentle music] I knew I was different all along, like as early as I had consciousness. I feel like my mom knew, but I think she also knew that, I mean, we were living in Erie, Pennsylvania, you know, in early '90s. So she was very like, "You need to like, "not play like a girl "when you're out playing with your friends." 'Cause I always wanted to be the girl character. I know it's shocking. I became like a drag queen though, basically at the very end of college. And there was once that we did "Pericles," which is a little-known Shakespeare play. This Russian director came and he was like the resident director. And he was like, "You read this." At first I was reading the male roles. He asked me to read the madam of the whorehouse. And I started reading it, and he was like, "But no, like this, like this." So I did it in a really high voice and I got the role and it was pretty epic. By the end of the run they were like, "Justin, you need to tone down your makeup "because it's getting too grotesque and too dark." I had blacked-out teeth, my lips drawn, wrinkles. That was the bite of the bug. Well then I moved to L.A. to be an actor, 'cause I wanted to get out of Pennsylvania. I thought it was too small. I was getting called a fag on the street and I didn't like that and I was like, "I need to go to a big city, "either New York or L.A., I don't care which one." My best friend happened to be living in Los Angeles so that was it. Well, Alaska Thunderfuck was a being that beamed itself into my body. I remember when I first moved to L.A. and I knew what she was. She was a glamazonian princess from the planet Glamtron who crash landed on Earth and who needs to get enough Twitter followers to get her spaceship back up and running again. And so she saw billboards of beautiful women and was like, "That's what I'm supposed to look like "to get through this world." She does that through her twisted vision of how she sees it. So like, she think she looks like fucking Marilyn Monroe, 'cause she does. - [Alaska's Mother] Jus? - [Alaska] Gabe is coming, I think Cory's coming too. - [Alaska's Mother] Oh, Cory's gonna be there too. Oh my God! Should I call you after we find out? Well, yeah, okay. But then it'll be a spoiler alert. No, of course, yes. - [Alaska's Mother] All right, honey. Well, I love you. I love you, too. I'm watching the last. Bye. Talk to you later. May the best woman win. Bye. I think that she thinks I'm not going to win because of how the fan interaction online has been in the last week. 'Cause I had a horrible episode last week where I just looked like an asshole, so that's all my mom is seeing. So I think she thinks I'm not gonna win, so I guess we'll see. Oh yeah, I've been dreading it since we filmed it. We filmed it over a year ago and I've been dreading that episode coming out and what it was going to look like and how people were going to respond to it. The response hasn't been great. [laughs] I get so many messages that are like, "No matter what everyone online says, I still love you." Which is like, so what are people saying online? Like, it's that bad?

And you start to believe it. Drag is definitely armor. I do get to work out a lot of the issues that I have through the art and the character, which is great, but I do also think I need therapy after this process. Like, seriously. - [Interviewer] What's your like, worst fear about it? Like, about tomorrow morning or late tonight. I mean, my worst fear about it is that it's going to ruin my reputation that I've worked really hard for and that it's gonna make people not wanna work with me and not hire me and that I won't have a job anymore. That's worst-case scenario. 'Cause like, this show is more than just a show to people, it's a religion and it's a way of life and it's a phenomenon and it's like the Bible.

Some of those kids don't even listen to a fucking word. It's like they watch it with the sound off. They're like, "Oh my God, they look so good. "I don't understand what she's wearing, though." Or like, whatever, it's all they see is just surface shit. I swear, maybe I'm just being way too harsh and critical or just bitter and old or something, but yeah, the kids are just so obsessed they don't know how to talk to it, all they know how to do is put eyeliner on. - [Interviewer] So, you're going there for Christmas? Right before and then I do a show there and then leave on Christmas Eve. - [Interviewer] Where are you going for Christmas? All my family is going to my brother's in Washington state. - [Interview] Are you going or do you work that? No. - [Interviewer] Alaska, what are you doing for Christmas? - [Alaska] My mom was like, "I don't want anyone "to talk about politics "at the holidays." No, let's talk about it. - [Alaska] So out of respect I'm like, "Okay, well I'm not going to," but it's also like, members of my family are like, personally affronting my existence and I don't feel comfortable not talking about that. It's like, I don't wanna fucking see you. I don't wanna fucking see your fucking face. - [Interviewer] Did you go for Thanksgiving? I did and no one came to my mom's house. Oh my gosh, look who it is. Fucking Donald Trump, and he's mad he didn't get what he wanted for Christmas. Oh, man, what the? ♪ Uh, uh, uh ♪ Girl, why you complaining ♪ You're not in India starving ♪ It's not like you don't have nothing ♪ ♪ You're so damn spoiled, it's alarming ♪ ♪ You got some parents that love you ♪ ♪ A brother that bugs you ♪ So lucky that you got a rooftop above you ♪ ♪ Christmas is cool, so get into it ♪ ♪ You get what you get and you don't throw a fit ♪ ♪ Christmas rocks, Christmas rocks ♪ ♪ Christmas rocks, Christmas rocks ♪ ♪ Look, I just got a pair of tube socks ♪ ♪ Christmas rocks, Christmas rocks ♪ ♪ Wanna bet me, I'll bet you a million bucks ♪ ♪ Thank you Mom and Dad, I can't really be sad ♪ ♪ 'Cause I guess Christmas really isn't isn't that bad ♪ Well, before the election and just being a transgressive asshole that I am, I would say in the press and I would say a lot like, you know, "Let Trump win, "let's return to fags being punk "and being against the system," because you know, we had eight years of Obama and our fan base tends to be a little younger. So our fans basically grew up with "Drag Race" and Obama. So I was kind of like, "Oh God, bring Trump in." Remind these kids, you know, just how quick things can change and how a new normal can sprout up overnight and well, I take it all back now. Oops. Has the Trump administration changed how I feel about my job? A little, but not as much as how Orlando has changed how I feel about my job. I found out about the Pulse tragedy on the Battle of the Seasons tour on the tour bus and we had to go straight to Minneapolis and do a show that night. [sighs] God, everyone was so freaked out that day, too. It was really weird. Michelle sang "Take a Bow" by Madonna every night and she's like, "Will you all come on stage with me?" And we were just a mess. It was a messy-ass show. But that was the only show my mom came to see, so it was really nice, you know? [gentle music] Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't think I ever got that sad about Orlando for awhile. - [Interviewer] Well, it sucks. I forgot about that day, too. It was so crazy. It was so crazy I ate meat. - [Interviewer] You ate meat? Yeah, I just didn't give a fuck, I went to Jimmy John's and had a BLT, it was so good. - [Interviewer] And you're a PETA, well, you're a well-known vegetarian. Who cares? That pig was really mean. No, the Native Americans believe that there are two-spirit beings who are men and women and their function in society is healers and truth-tellers and soothsayers and that's what we do. We put on fantastical costume and dress and we go out and we make a spectacle and we tell the truth and we exorcise people of their demons. That's what we actually do. So did you always know that you were a witch like that? How long ago did you find out? Well, I didn't realize that's what I was doing when I started, I just had to do it. I was called to do it. I had to. I remember you said that on the show, "This is my calling." And I was like, "Oh, hundred percent agree." It is. It's a calling. We don't choose to do it, it makes no sense. Well, now kids choose to do it. Choose to do it, but I couldn't do anything else. Yeah, exactly. I literally couldn't work at Starbucks 'cause I would be so bad and afraid at it. But it's like, for some reason, slamming my fucking gross dick-pussy into the ground a million times is like a cathartic experience that people love but-- Well, some people love it. [Katya wheezing] General public seems to think it's okay. You've been panned critically. Yeah, and pandered to. Just across the board. You have like, a 2% on Rotten Tomatoes. Thank you for two, I was gonna say one. You're so generous, snake. [gentle music] It is now that we must band together. We must unify, we must rally, we must join up arm and arm and protect one another, so that no matter where this world goes next, at least we'll have each other. And what's the best way to unify a group of people? What's the best way to rally people together? It's with a rousing anthem. [gentle music] Being a drag queen is kind of like, it's a clown stripper. You're half clown, half stripper. I think it's very important to have clowns and to have people willing to like, make fun of themselves for the sake of making a better community or to make fun of the people who are bullies and are adversaries so that we know that we're just as strong, if not stronger than them. I've always been really nervous about being too truthful or to say and speak and be and do as I really am in here. The second you start editing your work for the perception of other people is impending doom. There's a reason why successful artists get to where they are and you gotta go with your gut. - [Jinkx] Through Sharon, I learned to not give a fuck, and through Alaska I learned what you can achieve when you commit yourself fully to something, and from Katya I learned not to be brainwashed by my society anymore. Has the perception of drag changed, yes. Do I think they're ever gonna allow them to be in mainstream media, never. I guess I see a world where it's not a goal to become mainstream. It's a goal to just be pure. That's actually the goal. Drag is realness. In a world where it's like complete bullshit on the television at all times. On the billboard, in the newspaper, on Instagram, everything is fake, but drag, going to a drag show, that's something real. We live in a society that still is so rigid and still has so many constraints on how you're supposed to be allowed to express yourself. It's a business to brainwash people. We live in a capitalist society. Any trick to get people to spend money on what you want them to spend money on is fair game. And to see someone who's so not brainwashed [laughs] gives us hope. It's what drag is at its core, is being a truth-teller, is holding a mirror up to this society that we live in and saying: Look at that. Isn't that fucking something. Let's laugh at it, let's celebrate it, but also take the fucking piss out of it. Let's regurgitate it and interpret it and make it ours. Make it human, make it fucking real. ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair, I don't wear wigs ♪ ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair, I don't wear wigs ♪ ♪ This is my hair, I don't wear wigs ♪ ♪ This is my hair, I don't wear wigs ♪ ♪ This is my hair, I don't wear wigs ♪ ♪ This is my hair, I don't wear wigs ♪ ♪ This is my hair ♪ This is my hair
