An incident happened to our watchman's daughter, Right? I am thinking of a resemblance.. - Gosh.. Oh god That issue is cleared Why are you confusing both these matters? Why illiterates like me, Construct a college... and appoint people like you as employees? Because, You are an educated person? No, Thinking that you'll handle such issues Look, Already we've constructed the college by encroaching the forest However, Before next year, I'll bribe the minister & get the land registered But, If they find out before that, I am not a sage for them to forgive me I am an ordinary person They will seal the entire college That's.. Actually.. We are charging 4 Lakhs to 8 Lakhs per seat as donation If they seal & close the college, Will you give that money to me? You won't pay, Right?

Come Till now, A total of 12 girls have discontinued their studies Out of which, We have the reason for the discontinuation of 4 girls The reason for 8 girls is not available Out of them, We know my friend Poornima and your friend Swathi So, We can conclude 8 girls have died Yeah.. But, We don't know how they died? And why haven't anyone spoken about this so far? I heard the conversation of principal and the college owner The reason for hiding all these deaths is Because, The college has been constructed by encroaching the forest If this comes to limelight, The authorities will shut down the college So, They have hidden everything They won't disclose this even if many other girls die They will use their influence & hide it - Yes.! What can we do now, Arul?

Come, I'll explain you Come Maya We believed that leopard attacks is the reason for all the incidents in the college That's how the college management believed too But, Leopards are not behind these murders - Are they not due to Leopards? Then, Are you believing the college watchman? Is that the truth? Yes.! As you said, From police report to- -postmortem, everywhere it is mentioned as Leopard But, None of the leopards follow the same pattern to kill A pattern? What are you saying? Gosh.. Listen. I'll explain as you can understand A man will kill either in anger or for revenge Likewise, An animal kills either for hunger or to escape from humans But, apart from these 2 things, After selecting their targets A man who enjoys his killing is the reason for all these murders If it's not a leopard or a human, What we saw that day was a ghost? That's not a ghost He is a psycho - What? A psycho? Hey, What is he saying? Hey, Wait.. Wait Look, Based on Manimegalai's father's statements Someone is coming to the hostel He is remaining invisible and he is kidnapping & killing the girls of his wish He made everyone blame the leopards for these deaths and he is roaming happily Now, Where would he be?

Sir, Please come this side Constables, Lock him in the cell immediately Sir, Who is he? He is not an ordinary person as you think Before 20 years, I was working as an head constable in Masinagudi Then, A terrible event has happened which can't even be imagined in dreams A 15-year-old boy called Kaali never showed any interest in playing and was always interested in staying alone But, He had interests on many other things Those interests kept increasing day-by-day One day he was hiding something in a pot without his father's knowledge When his father inquired him & checked the pot He saw a lot of hair clusters He got terrified and inquired about it Kaali smiled & said that those were his friends' His father noticed a bit of blood stain in his hand and asked him to show his friends Then, Kaali took his father to a dense forest When they went behind a rickety building 2 girls between the age of 12 & 14 were lying there brutally murdered and their body parts were distorted Without understanding the events, When he saw his son He was smiling without any guilt His father was shocked and he understood that his son is mentally unstable But, Thinking that he should not lose his only son The father hides the dead bodies of those two girls A woodcutter saw these events and informed in the village The entire village questions Kaali's father He took the blame to save his son's life The entire village kills Kaali's father before him After 1 year, 3 girls who came as tourists to that place went missing The entire village searched for them in the forest But, They did not go missing They were kidnapped by Kaali He even murdered 2 girls But luckily, One girl escaped from him and informed us everything When he was arrested, The entire village followed us to thrash him Then, He was smiling in front of me in that jeep and I still remember it We came to know all the past incidents in our interrogation Then, I came to know that he had escaped from the Juvenile home After that, I am seeing him now - Let me see how he escapes hereafter - Okay sir - Hey, Order a Tea for me - Okay sir Hey, Check whether he is there inside? After that, I thought that he would create a ruckus in the college again But, He never turned up and I too forgot him Okay, Why are you inquiring about this now? Nothing brother. Just to know about the college I have some work in the canteen Can I leave? Thanks brother - You have heard him, Right? - Yes? What about it? This college and D-Block.. Everything was constructed by him Then, we saw him with some black coating on that day, Right? - Why was that? - I don't know He might have some reasons for it You go to the right side I'll go to the left side Let's see, if we are getting any clues about his trespassing Let's go & check that side - Hey, What happened dude? - No, Nothing!
