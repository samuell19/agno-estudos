[dramatic music playing] [suspenseful music playing] Alex! Another nightmare? Do you wanna tell me about it? It's... complicated. [groaning] Try and get some sleep. It's only a few more hours before everyone gets here. [dramatic music playing] [arrows thwacking in distance] [birds chirping] Sybil! Time for breakfast! - Whoa! - Papa Nickolaou! Alex! Who are you racing this fine morning? No one. You can't lose when you're not racing anyone. Yes, but you can't win either. You're getting swifter every day, which means you are growing. Not fast enough. Everyone grows at exactly the rate they were meant to. But I suppose some breakfast might help. [chuckles] [door locks] [cutlery clinking] Uh, no books at the table, please. - What are you reading? - It's called Last Flight by Amelia Earhart. It's her notes and diaries of how she crossed the Pacific Ocean - all by herself. - Not entirely by herself, as I recall. I believe she had a navigator with her. - Yes, it's Fred No on an! - That's him. Didn't do her much good, apparently. I wouldn't be too sure about that. I imagine it must be very comforting to have someone with you when you're lost. Being alone is a very hard thing. Everyone should have someone they can get into a little mischief with. [vehicle honking in distance] - Speaking of which... - Eh, eh. Eat your breakfast. - Done. - Me, too! - [girls] Sybil! - [screams] [all chuckling] Aw, it's good to see the girls together again. Yes, it is. [chuckles] [Zoe] I saw your post from Peru. [Theo] The whole country looked amazing. It was kind of haunting. The City in the Clouds, apart from it all. - Sounds beautiful. - It was. Oh, Andres, it's so beautiful here! - [all] Ooh! - Stop, it Alex. Who is Andres? You haven't told them about your foreign fling? It's not like that and you know it. What foreign fling? Oh, he's this handsome Peruvian travel buddy... who you keep on texting! [screams] He's helping me with my Spanish. - [girls] Mm-hmm? - [Alex] Oh, yeah? Say one thing in Spanish. Te quiero mucho. - [all laughing] - Mucho, mucho! Enough! I hereby terminate this preposterous Peruvian pen pal conversation and submit a motion to commence the first challenge of this year's Nickolathlon. I second it! What's the challenge? - Archery. - Easy. Not so fast. It has been decided the first challenge of this year's Nickolathlon shall be archery! Three targets, three arrows, no excuses. [upbeat music playing] [arrow whooshes] [cheering] This is ridiculous. How do I even aim with this thing? Three targets, three arrows, no excuses! All right, all right. - Ooh! So close. - [scoffs] [exhales] [arrow whooshes] [pan clunks] [clattering] Um, I-I did that on purpose. - Mm-hmm. - Mm. Okay. Ooh! It's not over yet! Zoey could still win this round for hitting the closest to the target. I can't believe it! It's neck and neck! Things are really heating up as we head into the third and final round. - You're kidding. - Nope. [exhales] [gasps] Oh! Way off course! Don't know what happened there. With Alex and Theo eliminated, this is Zoey's window to get it all. This is the showdown of the century! It's cousin versus cousin. Young versus old. They're one year apart. [screams] Yes! You did it! That pencil didn't stand a chance. Good game. Are-are you okay? I'm fine. Just need a chance to redeem myself. - Right now? - Now's as good a time as any. - What's the challenge? - A footrace. - [sighs] - You don't approve? Why does it have to be a footrace? Can't it be like... Like trivia or something? I'm much better at trivia. You guys know that I can't beat you guys in a race. Then, you can stand at the finish line. [sighs] I'll be inside. Alex, wait! Alex, don't be like that! She'll be fine. She just needs to learn that not everything is about her. She can't control her age. You were ten once, too. I'd trade entrance exams for losing a race any day. [clock ticking] - [door clicks] - [whoosh] [clock ticking] [birds chirping] [clock ticking] This is the finish line! Ready... - [clock ticking] - [clock hands whir] Set... Go! [exhales slowly] [clock hands whir] [groans] [crying] [clock hands whir] [gasps] [panting] Nice save. - What happened? - How did you react so fast? Uh, so no winner for this challenge. Call it a draw? Uh, I guess so. Um, maybe we should go find Alex. Yep. [clock ticking] [grunts] [whispers] Wow. [indistinct chatter in distance] - What a silly question! - You know what I mean. Yeah, we didn't exactly have the most conventional childhood. And yet you still have all of your fingers and all of your toes. - And lots of character. - We're leaving the girls with you. We trust you, but you don't exactly discourage perilous activities. - What, what... - Scraped knees and bruises are one thing, but just look at what you have in this room alone. I think it's safer that I have them in here rather than the alternative, don't you agree? Besides, no one's allowed in my office. Oh, I think Alyssa is just worried about the things you don't have control over. - Like when Sybil was young. - That was taken care of. - You helped me take care of it. - Oh, I remember, Dad. Okay, we just want you to remember that, yes, they are smart and clever, but they are still young. They're gonna try to get in enough trouble on their own. [chuckles] I shan't underestimate them. [chuckles] [clock dings] Oh, time to go. You better go get your bags. Hello, little one. It's all right. I was young, too, once. I understand the allure of the unknown. Let me see what you've chosen. Hmm. Oh! Ah! [chuckles] These are not easy books. It's okay. I'm already at a 10th-grade reading level. [both chuckle] I think these might be even more advanced than that. Oh. Hmm. [blows] Maybe just one. Just this time. [sighs] But you must promise me to take care of it. This is one of the most important books in my study, and I'd be very sad if something were to happen to it. Hmm? Let's go see everyone off, shall we? Let's go! Let's go! Time waits for no man! And the beautiful beaches of Greece won't suntan themselves. It's a research trip, Papa. Oh, hopefully you can mix in a little pleasure with all that business. The country holds a very special place in my heart. You be safe and look after the girls. Everyone is old enough to take care of themselves. Still, you're the oldest. I'm counting on you. Now, listen, it's not about the time you spend... [both] It's who you spend it with. That's right. Listen to your Papa and minimize the funny business. Now, give your big guy a hug. [chuckles] Hey. You really don't have to drive us, Dad. Oh, nonsense. Gotta keep these old eyes sharp. Besides, I think the girls have earned a few hours away - from their dusty old Papa. - [all chuckle] - [mutters] - Okay. - [all] Bye! - Have a good trip. [door closes] So, what should we do next? Tag. You're it. - Tag. - Hey! I'm not playing! I couldn't catch any of you. Besides, I have a new book to read. - [clock ticking] - [clock chiming] Where'd you get that? Papa Nickolaou. He let me borrow it. Really? From his study? Must be a cool book. It is. Take a look. So, who won the race? Uh, no one, actually. Zoey almost tripped, so we called it a draw. So, she tripped and you didn't win? No, I caught her. We both stopped before the finish line. I would have blown right by her. Better take your wins when you can get them. You're probably just used to winning all the time. I'm sorry about before. I know you're not as fast as us. But trust me when I tell you that growing up is not all it's cracked up to be. You're just saying that because you're not ten anymore. Do you know why I want this year's Nickolathlon to be the best ever? Because it's my last one. After I graduate this summer, I have to go to some prestigious school in the middle of nowhere. Mom and Dad are already helping me with applications. I had to be ten, too, you know? For a whole year. Then I suffered through 11 and survived 12. You will, too. And once it's over, you'll miss it as much as I do. I highly doubt that. Well, we'll see. It's not about the finish line. It's about the steps you take to get there. I was about to send a search party. What's that? It's a book Papa Nickolaou let Alex borrow. [both] From the study? - Can I see it? - Sure. Just be careful. Of course. "The beginning is the end is..." Weird. Is that a typo? No, you're reading it wrong. As a linear sentence, it doesn't make sense, but read it in a circle. It's a cycle. "The beginning is the end is the beginning is the end is the beginning." The sentence doesn't start or stop. Wow! It's beautiful. - Is this the manor? - It is. Look, here's the kitchen, down here is the hallway, and there's the study. What does spatium mean? Could mean a lot of things. "Room" maybe. - Time Room. - That makes no sense. It says "The Gate of Space and Time". Right? That makes so much more sense. Thanks for clearing that up. Wait. Where is the Time Room? If this the study, and this is the drawing room, then there's no physical space for this room to exist. Did they tear it out? Renovate? No way. There isn't even a closet where it should be. [dramatic music playing] This is it. Hmm. Well, I'm fascinated to see where this leads. It's physically impossible to put another room where you're standing. What does the paper say? "How oft Time's hands join half a day, this age The Four will make their way." Time has hands? "With darkness drawn and chaos mounted, a new day dawns, though time is counted." That's just gibberish. Is this it? I've never seen this before. I-I don't understand. This... this door can't lead anywhere. Isn't weird that we've never seen this before? We've been up and down these hallways a million times. [door creaks] - Whoa. - This is impossible. Guess not. [chuckles] - Alex! - [Alex] What? It's just an imaginary Time Room! What's the worse that can happen? [Alex chuckling] I've never seen anything like this. Why has no one ever told us about this room? - What if nobody knows about it? - Well, someone made that map. What does it say to do next? Um... nothing. There's nothing else. What about the book? Mm. [Theo] I don't see anything about a Time Room in here, but there are more maps and pictures. [indistinct whispering] Sybil, come look at this. [marbles clinking] [Theo] They look like they could be thousands of years old. They're incredible. [fire whooshes] No, no! Fire, no! [sighs] I-I just don't understand. Where can this room fit inside the manor? Um, maybe it isn't inside the manor. [birds chirping in distance] Close the door, Zoey. - What did you see out there? - Uh, it... it was a... a forest with, uh... - And you? - It's a magical forest. Okay. Okay. Uh, open the door again, would you, Zoey? [birds chirping] Close it. All right. Okay. Is there another door in here somewhere? Right. Alex! It's fine! It's just a magical forest! Zoey! All right, well, this is the only door in or out of this room, and it seems this room is no longer inside the manor. So, I think we have to leave this room in order to find the manor. We have to go out in order to come back in. [sighs] [groans] Girls? It was the only way out. We'll be all right as long as we stick together. Yes! [particles whooshing] We're nowhere near the manor. Uh, um... Do you recognize something? I wouldn't say recognize, but I think it's a door. [Theo] A door? Where? It does look like a door. And so it begins. Where's the doorknob? There is no doorknob. Just a keyhole. If you get that open and just jump in there all willy-nilly, I swear... Hey, guys, look at this. If it's in the book, maybe it can help us get home. Over here. This looks like a piece of that tablet. But it's broken. Fan out and search for other pieces. [clock ticking] [clock hands whir] I found one! Me, too! Let's see how these fit together. Okay, Zoey, yours is, like-like, at the bottom. Maybe, like, rotate it. Uh, no. Okay, Sybil, yours is, like, at the top. No, put it, like, at the other top. Okay, wait. I just... [Alex] Zoey and Sybil, seriously, get it together! - [laughs] - Would you like to try? Turn your piece again just one more time, counterclockwise instead. Yes. Perfect. That just leaves this one. [whirring] [wind whooshing] - [gasps] - [groans] Stay back! - We're not gonna hurt you. - Careful, Zoey. [grunts] Take it easy! [grunts] - Nice. - [Agot grunts] - Ow! That's it! - Hey, Zoey, look at him. - He's just scared. - Scared? Agot is never scared! Agot... What is this? Not daemon or pixie. Those faces... What are you? We're just... people. People? People. Human people? And that book? She likes to read. You really don't know where you are? This is the Forest of Forgotten Thoughts. It's where people are sent to be... well... Forgotten? But who would wanna forget you? Most things are forgotten eventually. [exclaims] Forgive me. Isolation has dulled my senses. I did not recognize you. I am Agot, humble servant and Protector of the Passage. And who do you think we are? This is the Eleventh Age, which means you are The Warriors Four, the Guardians of Time. And you're the Protector of the Passage? Wherever you'd like to go, and whenever you'd like to be there. Can you help us open it? - I cannot. - [sighs] Listen, we're not who you think we are. We just came here by mistake and we just wanna go home. You are the Guardians of Time, it's undeniable, but regardless, I cannot open the passage, because I do not have the Tempus Key. - Well, where is it? - It was disassembled long ago. Is there no other way to open it? The Tempus Key is the only way. Otherwise, it's just a door. But why is the door here in the middle of a forgotten forest? To protect it, of course. Do you know how much power that is? The ability to go anywhere, anytime? I could read the scrolls in the lost Library of Alexandria. You'd have to know Latin. I can learn Latin and then read the scrolls in the lost Library of Alexandria! Or we could return home. So, to get back, we have to go through a locked door, and to unlock it, we have to find a broken key? Not broken. Disassembled. All you need to do is gather the three Crystals of Time to reassemble... [feet thudding in distance] [growling in distance] Someone must know you're here. [suspenseful music playing] [growls] It can teleport? Time works strangely here. Some creatures can manipulate it in subtle ways. [growls] Are you okay? [growls] [gasps] Alex! [growls] [clock ticking] [dramatic music playing] [suspenseful music playing] - Sybil, we have to run! - But Alex... [Zoey] Sybil, now! [Agot yells] [yelps] - [growls] - [pants] [Agot] Good riddance! - [Alex] What happened? - [groans] - Are you hurt? - Poison branches. I'll be all right if we can stop the infection in time. [groans] How we do that? Grey a, an old friend. She can help. Where are the others? Far from here. I'll help you get there. And I shall help you reunite with the other Guardians. [suspenseful music playing] [growls] There! I see a break in the woods! [screams] [shrieks] [growls] [shrieking] [Pamphilos] Well done, Shadow. [squawks] [Pamphilos] The Treefolk are not usually aggressive creatures. But they can be controlled with magic. You must have angered someone very powerful. We didn't do anything. We were just trying to find a way out when they attacked us. - They? - Yeah, there were two... - [gasps] Alex. - No, you can't go back in there. - It's too dangerous. - I don't care, Theo! - I can't just leave her there with... - With Agot. He knows what he's doing far better than we do. And they could be anywhere. Who knows how far that thing teleported them? You lost a member of your party? Yes. My sister. [sniffing] Shadow has her scent now. He will find your sister. [grunts] What brings you to Kairos? Is that what this place is called? You don't know where you are? We didn't mean to come here. We entered this world through a door that doesn't exist in a room that doesn't exist in our grandpa's house. We're hoping if we find the Tempus Key, then we can get back home. The Tempus Key? But that means... I apologize for not recognizing you sooner. You're the Warriors Four. The Guardians of Time. That's us, I guess. I am Pamphilos, former soldier of the Atlantean Guard. Uh, well, I'm Sybil. That's Theo and Zoey. Zoey? I've never heard a name like that before. I've never heard a name like Pamphilos. Well, welcome to Kairos, world between worlds from which time itself springs. Last line of defense against Kronos and home to all who have been lost to time. Lost to time? Is that where the dinosaur came from? Indeed, it is. Shadow and I were not always travel companions. But we met each other here, fellow outcasts. I am honored to be in your presence. Permit me to accompany you in your journey. I pledge my fealty and swear to give my all to fulfill the prophecy. Prophecy? "How oft Time's hands join half a day, this age The Four will make their way." How do you know that rhyme? I've heard it since I was a child. Everyone has. The foretelling of the arrival of The Warriors Four to lift the curse and take their place as the Guardians of Time. Okay. I think we're gonna need an explanation about this whole guardian thing if everyone's gonna keep bringing it up. Pamphilos, could you explain to us what you've just said as though we've never heard any of it before? [soft chuckle] I see. - Follow me. - One second. We are about to follow a mysterious stranger off into the wilderness. - He seems nice. - Nice doesn't mean safe. [Sybil] We are also effectively giving up on Alex - and hoping she's okay. - We are not giving up. With or without Alex, we can't get home without the Crystals. Okay. I just wanted to make sure we were committed to this. Next challenge of the annual Nickolathlon... find Alex. [Zoey and Theo] Find Alex. [Agot] You have shown me great kindness, strength, and bravery. Are these attributes part of your powers as a Guardian? I don't have any powers. Perhaps you do not see. But I... [groans] Will your friend know what to do? Grey a is an incredibly powerful sorceress. Is she nice? She is... wise. [groans] Hello. [water trickling] [groans] He needs your help! We don't have much time! [groans] - [Grey a] Time is not kind to all. Indeed there are those who would prefer its dissolution. It appears time has been less kind to me than it has to you. You may not recognize your humble compatriot Agot, at your service. Agot. Always good to see a friend. Your venom is spreading. Come. [groans] Is he gonna be okay? In time. And with the right care. What brings you so far from home, little one? How do you know I don't live out here? [Grey a] You wear your feelings like a veil. And nothing lives out here, they've made sure of that. [indistinct chanting] Thank you, old friend. Rest now. Let it run its course. What do you mean, nothing lives out here? Agot and I share an unfortunate history. The same people who imprisoned him banished me to live out my days in this cursed place. Crops cannot grow in this soil, and no living thing comes within miles. Who would do this to you? They're gone now. But their presence echoes. The Crystals could restore order. Right these wrongs. Is that why you've come this way? The Temple of Chronoception? But without a Guardian of Time, you won't be able to... I see. Chronoception. I think I read about that. [pages flipping] [bird squawking] The Age of Gods rose and fell, but the Titans remained. The ruthless Titan Kronos was trapped in the outer realm, but the Titan Prometheus found mankind noble and beautiful, and chose to live among them. He fell in love, married, had children, and grandchildren. All the while, his brother, Kronos, plotted to undo reality as we know it, return this realm into a timeless, space less void where he can rule once more. Kairos is the front line of conflict eons in the making, and in the Eleventh Age, prophecy tells of four warriors who will lead us to victory as the Guardians of Time. And you think we are those warriors, the... Guardians. We're almost there. Hold on! [Zoey] So we're trapped in the Bermuda Triangle of time and Papa Nickolaou is supposed to be a Greek god? That's right, if I understood the story correctly. This is ridiculous. I barely made it through midterms. I don't think I'm ready for a save-the-universe level of responsibility. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we have to reassemble the Tempus Key and find Alex. If Papa Nickolaou is who you say he is, he'll know what to do. Do you know anything about the Crystals of Time? There are three: The Crystal of Chronoception, the Crystal of Chronometry, and the Crystal of Chronology. They're hidden deep inside three unique temples, and that's how you'll know what I'm saying is true. What do you mean? Only the descendant of a Titan can enter each temple. I know you must have many questions, but when your feet touch the floor of the temple, there's no denying that the blood of Titans flows through your veins. Is that where you're taking us now? Not yet. [dramatic music playing] [Pamphilos] I don't know what you'll face in the Temples of Time, so you need to be prepared for anything. - [Theo] Is this Avalon? - What's left of it. Yeah, as in King Arthur and the... Knights of the Round Table. It's so well maintained compared to the rest of the castle. [chuckles] A few fellow soldiers and I preserved and protected this location before the Dark Times. After the First Great War, I started hiding caches in various locations should the need arise. I will help you focus the magic, but you must envision your weapon. Focus your energy. See yourself fighting confidently to protect what you love and make it reality. [dramatic music playing] That was incredible. You did beautifully. Who's next? [grunts, sniffs] [Grey a] I see this view so often every day, I sometimes forget how beautiful it is. What troubles you? Agot says the Temple of Chronoception is near here. I should be brave, like he says. But I'm afraid... without them. I've always thought I would be this great explorer. But I'm just scared and lonely. I want Sybil. [sniffs] I want to show you something. Wow. It's beautiful. When I was banished here, I used this to feel less alone. Look here. Relax. The glass responds to your heart. [breathes deeply] Whoa. Is that what I think it is? Perhaps. What do you think it is? Amelia Earhart's plane! The one she disappeared in! She and her navigator! I do not recall the name, but I do believe it was a female pilot. Wait, is this here? Everything you see in this looking glass is somewhere in Kairos. So... she didn't crash. She landed here, safely, lost to time. This was many years ago. She's with the Atlanteans now. Atlanteans? Like the city of Atlantis? Can we go there? I'd love to see it! [Agot] The Atlanteans are not a welcoming people, - particularly to creatures like me. - You're okay! How are you feeling? Much better, thank you. So, what do you mean, not like you? I am a "less than..." less than tall, less than fast, less than smart. I know how that feels. How could you? You are less than no one. You are a Guardian of Time. Not back at home. I'm just a little sister who can't keep up. What? What... What are they doing? They're not even looking for me! - And who is that boy? - He looks like a member of the Atlantean Guard. The images in the looking glass are not always what they seem. I'm sure they didn't mean to replace you. Take me to the Temple of Chronoception. [eerie music playing] We should be close. [blows] All right, let's go. [Agot] Unfortunately, I cannot join you inside. Only a Guardian may set foot inside the temple. For me, it is a simple archway. But I can't do it alone. As I have said before, you can. You were born to hold the Crystals. The Tempus Key is rightfully yours to wield. Nothing inside the temple can defeat a Guardian of Time. I don't feel like a Guardian of Time. Possessing the Crystal itself may unlock your powers. [sighs] Okay. Here goes nothing. [dramatic music playing] "Chronoception. The perception of the speed of time both forward and backward." [gasps] [case unlocking] [chuckles] [chuckles] You retrieved the Crystal? - Yes, I have it here. - And your powers? I think you might be wrong about those. I don't feel any different. We shall see. Have you used it yet? Used it? Yes, the Crystals hold the powers of Time within them. So... what do they do? The others affect the nature of time around you, but this is the Crystal of Chronoception. It affects the way time moves through you. Sounds like I have to do some homework. [thunder rumbles] Pamphilos, can I ask you something? Of course. In the woods, something strange happened. - With the vine giant. - Strange? Yeah, time stopped. It just froze, kind of. The giant was about to crush me, but then it was frozen and I was able to get out of the way. Is that normal? Does that happen a lot around here? There are some with the ability to manipulate time in small ways. Like the Treeback you encountered. But to stop time completely, that is a very powerful feat. It must be your powers manifesting. - Powers? - Ah, yes. You wouldn't have heard of this. The Guardians of Time each have a special gift. It is their birthright. It comes from your Titan lineage. It will take some time to develop naturally, but will be of great help to you in your journey. I haven't experienced anything like that. Is there something we can do to unlock it? There are ways, but it's best to let it happen naturally. Your powers will come to you when you need them. It's important to be ready for something like this. Too much power too fast can be a burden to carry rather than a strength to wield. Come, we are almost there. This is it? - It's just an arch. - To everyone else. But to you, this is the Temple of Chronometry. Chronometry? As in the measurement of time? Yes. Time moves in a measured, ordered fashion. But that was not always the case. Kronos's universe was one of chaos. There was no temporal order. Okay. - You sure about this? - Not even a little bit. But if it means getting closer to finding Alex, it'll be worth it. [dramatic music playing] [groans] Are you okay? Yeah. I'm-I'm just getting a headache. "Two bodies have I, though both joined as one. The more I stand still, the faster I run." What? An hourglass. Wait, this is timed? What happens if we don't figure it out in time? Let's not find out. [chuckles] [whispers] An hourglass... There was an hourglass at the entrance. - [groans] - Are you okay? No. Something's wrong. - It's in my head. - What do you mean "in your head"? The book. The pages I looked at, I can remember them all exactly. Every picture and every word. I remember what you had for breakfast last Sunday morning. Eggs on toast, over-easy, with two squirts of hot sauce. Mom had a breakfast burrito with green pepper, and Dad had leftover pizza from the night before, half pepperoni and half pineapple. I remember everything. I mean, it's a weird thing to remember, but it's hardly everything. No. I mean everything. I remember that you're on page 235 of the book you're reading. Your bookmark, it's... It's blue with gold dots. When I was five, we hid painted rocks in the woods behind the manor. When we went back to find them again, we couldn't remember where we had put them, but I remember now. I remember everything. [pants] [pants] Just breathe, Theo. You're okay. Just breathe. Clear your mind. I'm okay. It's just a lot to process. I suddenly have all these memories swimming around in my brain. It's like I'm still there hiding the rocks, or at breakfast. I can see it all in perfect detail, but... [sighs] If I don't think about it... [scoffs] I think having powers might not be all it's cracked up to be. [chuckles] - I know what to do. - You sure? It's in the book. I can see it like it's right in front of me. That hourglass, the one with the red sand, turn it over on the altar. - Look! - [all chuckling] You did it. I knew you would. I'm glad one of us did. Come, we need to find shelter. We don't wanna be travelling when the darkness rolls in. The darkness? [dramatic music playing] [sniffs] We'll use these stones to channel ancient magic to create a barrier stronger than any physical one we could build. I hope you don't think me ungrateful, but why are you helping us? I know this must be very new to you and the others, but to me, this is the most important conflict of all time, the only conflict that matters. And if I can contribute to the victory of good in any meaningful way, then it is my solemn duty and distinct honor to do just that. I also enjoy your company considerably. Um, the symbols on those stones, what do they mean? It's an ancient Atlantean dialect. The key to harnessing the magic of nature herself. [thunder rumbles] How much time do we have? Enough. What is it? The high servant of Kronos once led an army of dark forces in an effort to free the old Titan and shred the fabric of time and space. His name was Deimos. I fought alongside the armies of Atlantis, and together, we defeated and imprisoned him. That darkness is what remains of his army, cursed to endlessly wander in the night. Angry, violent, and hungry. We wouldn't last long outside the circle. - What about Alex? - Anyone who lives in Kairos knows a safe place to go at night. I'm sure she'll be safe with your friend. Incredible. Such power. I feel it emanating even now. That's the last of it. I shall see you on the morrow. You sure I shouldn't come with you? Not until your powers have fully manifested. It's too dangerous. - [thunder rumbling] - [gasps] What is it? Disorder. Chaos. The undoing of time itself. Many creatures thrive in it. Others are torn apart. But I thought the Crystals restored order. - Won't it protect me? - One of three. Stay here. You're safe with Grey a. I must go to the others now that we know where they are. There's no time to lose. I'll be back before you know it and you'll all be reunited. [shuddering sigh] - That darkness... - Pay it no mind, child. I know how to make your powers manifest. [soft chuckle] [panting] [fire crackling] [thunder rumbling] Can't sleep? I have dreams sometimes. This one specific dream, actually. A lot. I'm beginning to wonder if it isn't really a dream. What do you mean? Doctors tell me it's the response to a childhood trauma, but it feels different. When I was small, I was alone in the manor. Everyone else had gone to a party, but I wasn't feeling well. A man broke in and ransacked my grandfather's study. I bumped into him. He frightened me. Sounds frightening. Especially for a child. But it's more than that. I don't just see that night. I see us as we are now. I've seen it my whole life. You've always dreamt this? As long as I can remember. Sometimes I see things when I'm awake, like déjà vu for something that hasn't happened yet. Visions. It's more than that. They feel like more than memories. Like I'm actually there. It's clearer this time, though. It's always felt like something was wrong with me, something to be afraid of. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. A gift can seem like a curse until you find its meaning. [thunder rumbles] It's so dark. This is the work of Deimos. The desire of Kronos. What we're fighting against. If we fail, the universe will fall into darkness and disarray. Then we won't fail. - [thunder rumbles] - [gasps] What was that? The Dark Army is very active tonight. They sense its power. Are we in danger? You retrieved this Crystal on your own. You have nothing to fear. If that isn't enough testament to your power... you will soon see what you truly are. I wish my sister was here. You don't need your sister. Not anymore. [yells] I can't let go! Grey a, please help! [groans] Ow, ow! [screams] I'm so sorry you had to experience that. How do you feel? I-I don't know. [slurping] - [dragon growling in distance] - [gasps] Grey a? Grey a? [growling] What's that noise? - [growls] - [screams] No! No! [growls] [suspenseful music playing] [roars] [growls] [panting] [crying] Hush, child. You're safe now. No one can hurt you ever again. - What happened? - Your powers. It would seem you wield the power of Entropy. Entropy? Change over time. You hold at your fingertips the very powers of change. Did I... did I do this? I'm sorry. Don't you understand? You are the most powerful creature I've ever met, more powerful than the other three Guardians combined. - What? - Yes. Judging by the sigils on their armor... Hindsight, Presence, and Foresight... They each wield one component of past, present, and future. But you... you wield the power of all three at once. Rest now. Recover. And when you wake, take your rightful place as a Guardian of Time. [birds chirping] We aren't far from the Temple of Chronology. We should easily arrive there by midday. - That's great news. - Splendid news, indeed! - Agot! - State your business, traveler. I see you have company. - Where's Alex? Is she safe? - You know him? That's Agot. He helped us when we first got here. - Alex is safe and sound. - Where is she? Waiting for you in the Temple of Chronology. - I'll take you there. - Thank you, Agot. We have some breakfast left, if you'd care to join us. Oh, there's breakfast? I have enough for my needs, thank you. If he ever asks to see the Crystals, you mustn't oblige. What do you mean? The Crystals hold great power on their own, even without the Tempus Key. There are many who seek them at any cost. If Deimos were to ever obtain all three Crystals, he'd becomes unstoppable and the war would be lost. You heard him. Alex is waiting for us. [Grey a] And the way is clear. Continue as planned. She will face the others at the gate. I'm with them now. Will she be ready? She already is. She just doesn't know it yet. How long was I asleep? As long as your body needed. How do you feel? Different. But the same. Who were you talking to? - I have some difficult news. - What is it? The other Guardians. Their Atlantean companion has stolen and now wields the Crystal of Chronometry and all its power. He now seeks the Crystal of Chronology, - but they are powerless to stop him. - No! Agot is traveling there to help, but I fear he may not survive. We have to help them! You can stop him! Until all three Crystals are removed from their temples, I cannot leave this place. - I can. - It's too dangerous. Maybe. But what other choice do I have? It controls the way time flows through me. So let's make this an even fight. I'm done with being weak. I'm finished with being small! I'm through with being young! [groans] [screams] I'm so tall. And powerful. And fast. All the strength of age. He won't know what hit him. How will you get there? - I'm gonna run. - But you have no armor. I don't need any. We're very close now! Almost there! You said the war will continue on, even after we find the Crystals? Deimos and his servants will stop at nothing to free Kronos. What happened before? How did you defeat Deimos? We almost didn't, but fate was on our side. We were able to imprison him where he remains to this day. Imprison how? In a stone table in the Forest of Forgotten Thoughts. The tablet was shattered to ensure he couldn't escape. - It can't be. - Oh, no! - The stone in the forest. - That broken tablet. - Deimos. - What are you talking about? Agot is Deimos. He's taken the form of Agot, no doubt to gain your trust. He needs you to gather the Crystals since he can't enter the Temples himself. How can we trust him about Alex? How do we even know she's safe or even waiting for us at the Temple? She's too valuable to him to cause her any harm. At least, until he has all three Crystals. We can't let that happen. Was he lying about all of it then? Will the door not take us home? - Door? - The door in the tree. The Tempus Key unlocks time and space, not a door. The Key houses the Crystals and channels their powers. Deimos wants the power of the Crystals, not the Key. You should take it. Take it far from here. - Keep it safe from him. - I must refuse. The Crystals belong in the hands of The Warriors Four. Our only choice is to stand and fight. [dramatic music playing] [Agot] I see it! We're here! I can't help but think this is some kinda trap. It's the only way to get Alex back and go home. The last challenge. We can do this. We'll do it together. [exhales] - I'm confused. - What happened? Nothing. I was wondering when you were gonna get here. This is the second Crystal I've retrieved all by myself. It's the Crystal of Chronology. It wasn't even that hard. - Alex, look out! - You're trouble. What did you do to him? Alex? What happened to you? I got better. Better than you, at least. Just admit it. I won. I got two Crystals all by myself and the three of you only managed to get one. Alex, this isn't a game! What did you do to Pamphilos? Don't worry. He can't hurt you now. - You-you didn't... - He's fine. He's just trapped behind an ancient rock formation. See how he likes it. Alex... we were... so worried about you. Oh, yeah? So worried you got matching new outfits and picked up a boy? The Crystal of Chronology! Incredible! Beautiful, isn't it? - Alex, don't! - Relax, Zoey. Alex, you can't trust him. He's using you. Agot kept me safe. He protected me. Where were you? Off with some boy. It's not like that, Alex. Whatever. Let's just get the other Crystal from Pamphilos and go home. He doesn't have it! I don't know what Agot told you, but it was a lie! - Sybil, I'm not a kid anymore! - Clearly! I am more powerful than the three of you combined! Just give me the Crystal, so we can go home! Ow! What the... Look out! [pants] Alex! Get away from her. I've been trying to tell you, he's here to help us. Your powers are truly incredible. If you hand me the other Crystal as well, I might be able to... Verum adte! Show your true form! [Agot groaning] Agot? This is my true form. I didn't want to frighten you before. But... you're Agot. You're small and weak, like me. You're not small and weak anymore. You are strong. You can save this world, and I can help you. No. You... You lied to me. No, Alex. I protected you. They must be working together, in league with the forces of darkness. No. It's me. What have I... [screaming] Alex, you have to stop this! I can't. I can't control it. You can. I know you can. I'm scared. - No, Sybil, stop! - You can't! I have to. - [panting] - I can't stop it. You can. I can't! Then we'll just have to stop it together. [sobbing] [screams] I'm so sorry. [sniffles] It's okay. I'm here. [sighs] No matter. [dragon growls] - Oh, no. - What? - It's Grey a. - Who's Grey a? A second ago, I would have said a friend of mine. Right. [chuckles] Grey a is a dragon? Long story. [grunts] [roars] - It's now or never. - For what? To become the Guardians of Time. This should be interesting. [old Alex] Agot kept me safe. He protected me. Where were you? Off with some boy. [Theo] It's not like that, Alex. - [old Alex] Whatever. - I wanted to go back further. [old Alex] Get the other Crystal from Pamphilos, so we can go home. He doesn't have it. In exactly 17 seconds, that creature is gonna strike. Theo has photographic memory. It's a little more complicated than that. - Why aren't we noticing? - [old Alex] Sybil, I'm not a kid anymore! [Sybil] Clearly! Are you gonna throw that rock at me? I already did. In three, two... Ow! What the... Look out! That really hurt, you know? [Theo] It had to be done, for the good of the group. - [Zoey] Deimos. - [Pamphilos] Show your true form! [Zoey] What do we do? He's gonna see us. - [Theo] He won't see us. - [Zoey] How do you know? [Theo] Because he didn't see us before. What we don't know is what happens after our past selves travel back in time. [Zoey] So, what you're saying is, he won't see us yet? [Theo] Precisely. We narrowly escaped before, but we need to formulate a plan for what comes next. [rocks crumbling] I'm sorry about this next part. I have to say, Alex, it's quite an impressive ability. You've managed to utilize time itself as both a defense mechanism and a weapon. I probably shouldn't have rushed into it, though. It's not the age, it's the experience. [Theo] This is it. We just caught up with our previous timeline. - [Zoey] So, what's the plan? - [Sybil] We improvise. Clever trick. But you'll need more than that to defeat me. [thwack] I think that's our cue. - [old Alex] Agot? - [Theo] Fascinating. Now, we're watching our past selves watch our past selves. This is getting complicated. It seems like we can't go back any further than this point in time. Not without the Key. Sorry, everyone, but my embarrassing solo performance is coming up again. [Theo] I'm sorry we keep reliving this, Alex. [Sybil] It's all in the past. [Alex] Well, so are we. If we can't go back any further, aren't we kind of out of options? [Sybil] One thing at a time. I'm sure there's something we can do. If we can't change any of the variables, then our fate is pretty much fixed at this point. - Speaking of, Sybil... - Right. [Deimos] Nice trick, but you'll... - Tell me when. - Now. Are we going to keep playin' this game? It's grown rather tiresome. That's right. We can't keep this up forever. And we can't let him take the power of the Crystals for himself either. [Deimos laughing] This? I don't want this. I don't want the power of the Crystals. I want to destroy them. It's the only way to bring about the return of Kronos! Whoa. So, freezing time is Zoey's power. - What's your power, Sybil? - We don't know yet. Past. Present. Future! You can see the future, can't you? [Theo and Zoey] You can what? I think my mind can travel through time. I'm glad we got that straightened out, but I don't know how long I can hold this. What's the play? - I think I can change one of the variables. - How? If I use my power together with the Crystal of Chronology. - You mean that pile of dust? - I can fix that. Yeah. I don't know how much more I've got in me. Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast. [dramatic music playing] Alex! I'll be right back. [dramatic music playing] [Papa Nickolaou] It's all right, Sybil. I suppose he wasn't expecting me. And neither were you, I gather. Did you find what you were looking for? Yes, Papa. I have to go and take care of something, but you go right back to what you were doing. Alex! It's here. It's in the bag. - What? - The Tempus Key! I put it in the messenger bag ten years ago. Tear open the lining! - [fabric ripping] - [grunts] [roars] [shrieks] [roars] [chuckles] I have it here! - [growls] - [shrieks] [roars] Enough! Give me the Crystals! Get your own! [groans] Thank you. It's been my honor. [kisses] Let's go home. [all laughing] We couldn't have done it without you, Alex. I think I'm okay with turning 11 before I turn 20. Probably a good idea. You're gonna be an amazing woman someday, but right now I just want you to be my little sister. Looks like you have a lot to tell me. I can say the same about you. [all laughing] [man] Did you tell them the truth? I told them what they needed to know. [dramatic music playing] [woman vocalizing]
