I want to die. Today... I thought I want to die. I do it often. First time for me. Maybe beautiful women don't. What? You've never thought you wanted to die in 32 years? No. That's why I'm alive. If everyone thinking that really died, there'd be none left on Earth. What do you mean? Here's your beer. Thank you. Cheers. Everyone thinks that at least once in their lifetime. Not something to say after a toast, I guess. You too, Keiko? Of course. Even today, when I left the house, my husband started complaining about the food. Too little, too dull, and so on. I thought I wanted to die. I'm coming back to life. Takako, are you watching The Walking Dead? The zombie drama? No, never watched it. You should. Makes you feel you want to live. Really? I think so. Are you hungry? I wasn't until a moment ago. Talking to you made me hungry. Thanks. Oh, here it is. I ordered some food. What? The food you ordered doesn't look dull at all. You're right. Maybe I should send it to him. You're getting along well. I'm not so sure. Why did you want to die? Huh? It was a sudden thought. What was the situation? The situation? I was at the park, then suddenly... The park on a holiday's terrible. I know how you felt. It's lethal. Makes you wanna die. Yes, it does. I actually said it. That you wanted to die? To whom? Your guy? No, I said it to myself. You've had illicit affairs for too long, I guess. We split up a year ago. The one before too. And the one before. I didn't do it on purpose! They all told me later. Yeah, yeah. That's right. Why do only married men approach me? Because you're beautiful. What kind of theory is that? For an unmarried man, you're too beautiful. Like a flower beyond reach. Really? But for married men, it's like once in a lifetime I want to play with fire. I see. Listen. Can you at least try to be humble, even it's false modesty? Huh? Oh, sorry. Thanks for staying out so late. No problem. If I stay at home, I have nothing to do. Call me whenever. Are you gonna be OK? Don't die, all right? I want to die! I want to die! Oh, shut up! Shut up. I want to die! You're not OK at all. I feel a bit better now. Hey, Takako. Isn't there something you wanna do? What do you mean? We're giving up many things, you and me. We're just pretending we don't realize it. When you're so desperate, you can do anything. I... want to get married. What? Married? Yes! Even my parents are married. And you! I feel I can too. Married... I'll... go marriage hunting! MARRIAGE HUNTING BEAUTY "FOREVER MARRIAGE MARRIAGE HUNTING SERVICE" Keiko. You're right. You can't start these things in a half-hearted way. All right. "TODAY'S DULL DINNER! GOODNIGHT" Goodnight. Right. Now... "REGISTER NOW" "PROFILE REGISTRATION" Wha-? Ugh. Do I have to fill in all this stuff? Do you prefer a drive to the sea or to the mountains? What the... Ouch! Takako. Yes! When is it going to be ready? Sorry, I'm a bit stuck. That's unusual for you. Did I give you too much work? No, I'm fine. Really? Can you finish it by next week? By next week... Friday. I'd like to have it by Wednesday. Wednesday... Let's compromise and say Thursday, OK? I've got a week. I'll manage somehow. Don't strain yourself. Just make something good. Yes. I'm counting on you. Hello. A week... Zansu... "SUSHIZANSU" Zansu... Renewal opening... "I WANNA DIE" "I WANNA DIE I WANNA DIE" This is hopeless. "MESSAGE FROM A MALE MEMBER" I'm sorry! I apologize. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yes, yes. Sorry. I've got more messages! They're all old men. "FIRST TRY AND MEET THEM" All right. Love? Ms. Takako? "MITSURU AISAKA, AGE 35" Yes! You're beautiful. T-thank you. A perfect face, like an oil painting. Look. I've got a house. If you marry me, you can live here! Right. With the Shinkansen, you can reach Tokyo in 50 min even from Tochigi. Tochigi? Right. Symmetry... - I see. - What's your job? Oh, right... I work in web design. Ah, with the internet. Yes. Well, mainly design. You must get stiff shoulders. Yes, quite a lot. Being an accountant, I used to too. I see. But now I'm fine. Totally fine. Wow. My shoulders feel so light, thanks to these. What are those? If I take them off... If I take them all off, I can't lift my arm. - Huh? Really? - Doesn't move at all. I put one on. Still can't lift. Then two. It got heavier. With two... Oh, I see. And three. Look, it's totally different. - Incredible, isn't it? - Incredible. It's the same for this arm. They look a bit different. Yeah, they've got smaller beads. You can choose between 3 or 5. You've got the choice. They look like 5, right? It's one. There are potato chipsshaped like that. This one... You can spread it like this... Uh? Oh? It flew away.Did you find it? Is everything OK? - Er... - No way... I'm sorry. I spent 180,000 yen... Ms. Takako? Yes. Mr. Umezawa? Yes. Pleased to meet you. You're a fake. I know. I've met about 50 women. A beauty like you can't possibly be looking for a husband. That website's crap. You're mistaken! So, what is it? A badger game? I won't fall for that. I can't afford to waste my time! She can't be more beautiful than her profile photo! Gotta search again. I thought I'd never hear the term badger game in my life. I've only seen it written on gossip magazines. Thinking they all might be like that, I lost my enthusiasm. Don't quit! It's fun. There must be a lot of fun people. I'm not looking for someone fun! I'm looking for a husband. But meeting a lot of people is gonna expand your horizons, don't you think? It's a unique experience. I thought marriage hunting would be simple. You're so naive. What? They thought you were a fake because you're too beautiful. I see. Be humble! Sorry. I'm not that beautiful. Too late. You must keep marriage hunting. It's not that easy to find Mr. Right. Chat online a bit more, and if it feels right, meet him. All right. What are you doing? Tell me. It's too heavy. They look like a boring couple. I wonder what made them decide to get married. Excuse me. Yes? Are you married? Yes. Huh? Huh? - Sorry. - It's OK. I've got a wife. I didn't mean it that way. - Please! - No, really. What am I doing? "YOU MATCH WITH MR. SONOGI" "CONGRATULATIONS!" "YOUR COMPATIBILITY IS 91%" Ms. Sawatari, I uploaded the designproposal to the shared folder. Already?! There are still 3 days until the deadline! Nice! Very good! You looked pretty stuck. How did you do it? Did you see the light? I saw the light! Keep up the good work. Thanks! (TAKAKO) Yes, until I have kids. Then I'll concentrate on them. (SONOGI) I see. I feel I can talkabout anything with you. (TAKAKO) Me too. (SONOGI) I'd like to meet you asap. Do you need any help? Oh, thank you. Just ask me anything. I'm back. Welcome back. Hey, hey. Miyagawa, your shirt'salways untucked. Look. Guys who don't check their shirt in the mirror are no good. Yeah... I'll work hard a bit longer until it's time to go home. Er... Ms. Takako? Pleased to meet you, I'm Sonogi. We meet at last! I'm Takako. I'm really Takako! Huh?! I did call you Takako, right? Did I say the wrong name? No, you said it right. Sorry. Sorry. Let's go then. Yeah. This way? No, this way. Oh? What happened? - Just a minute. - OK. Why...? Wait... Oh! There it is. This way. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Shall we walk less close? Why? Well... I've never walked together with such a beauty. Just walk normally. It's fine. Really? I'm nervous. What's wrong? Our steps, right and left, have completely synchronized. I thought it was inexcusable. I don't mind. Just walk normally, please. No, no. I've got to... It's pretty difficult, though. Like this. What did you do? Hey. Why did you register on the marriage hunting website? To meet someone. I was in a long-term relationship, but we split up 5 years ago. I see. But it took courage to sign up. Yes, same for me. You too? Thanks to that, I was able to meet you today, though. I'm really happy I signed up. It's important to take action, I guess. You can't always take it easy. Sorry! I'm doing all the talking. It's OK. What you're saying is true. I think it's important to take action, too. That way. "MAKOTO SONOGI, AGE 32" Hey! Takako, please date me... With the intention to get married He looks so spineless. You're mean. When I first met him, I thought maybe he wasn't for me. But then we talked normally. Do you like him? Before, I'd have thought he wasn't my type. But now, maybe? I don't know yet. How can I put it... It's a relief meeting to get married, cutting all the courting short. Haven't seen you so bubbly in a long time. Really? Do you still want to die? I guess not! You're the type of girl who needs a man. Yes, a man. Hey. You've got the wrong idea about me, Keiko. No, I don't. I know you can't fall in love first with anyone. Don't say it that way, then. I'm rooting for you. Are you gonna meet him again if he asks? That's the plan. What should I do? I just want you to be happy. I thought it might be useful, but maybe not anymore.

They're all beautiful women, marriage hunting. This is reality. Wow! Looks great. Apple cocktail. Thank you. Is it good? Delicious. The barman here makes cocktails with seasonal fruit. You like fruit, right? Yes. Do you go there often? No, it was the first time. You gave that impression. I haven't asked your name yet. Takako. Mr. Yatabe, right? Huh? It's written there. You startled me. I thought you were a patient of mine. Would you feel embarrassed if you met a patient there? It'd be scary! You don't know what people write on SNS nowadays. You made me sober up. I'm sorry. So you're a doctor. I'm a dentist. Sorry, I can't save your life. It's OK. What's wrong? Oh, er... Hearing you're a dentist, I kind of feel self conscious. About showing me your teeth? Yes. You have nice teeth, Takako. Really? So you actually look at people's teeth. The moment I meet them. It's a professional disease. I guess that's the way it is. Though it's not the teeth we're interested in. But the inside of the mouth. It's mysterious, don't you think? Why? Even if you strip naked, none can see the inside of your mouth. Thank you. Can you get home? The trains are still running. When you want to have a drink, give me a call. I will. See you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Takako. Yes? The client was very happy!

Most annoying friend of the year prize. You're creeping me out. How was the singles bar? I met a dentist. Good on you. That's why you're doing that? No way I could guess that. Not even Sherlock Holmes would. Sorry. A dentist... He must be rich. Money matters, doesn't it? Hmm. More than that... He's easy to talk to. He's confident 'cos he's rich. You think? He's probably from a rich family. I think he said they run a dental clinic too. See? Dentist families are like kabuki dynasties. What are you saying? And what's-his-name? That weirdo you told me about. His name's hard to remember. - Sonogi? - Yeah, him. We're in touch. You know your stuff. Don't say that. I'm only checking my marriage opportunities. Yatabe, the dentist. He does look confident. But, you know... He seems to have too much experience with women. Sonogi's nice and replies to my messages right away... But he's a bit weird. Which one should I marry? Him? Or him? Oh, Sonogi... Aren't you too fixed on the aim of getting married? The wedding is just a ceremony. Married life is the main thing. Marriage is not that easy. I've just started to enjoy marriage hunting. Don't spoil it. Sorry. Bad habit of mine. What's the most important thing in married life? Patience. "TO: YATABE" Hasn't read it yet. Yatabe...

Yes, I've finished. You must be hungry. Yes, I am. I know a good sushi place. Let's go there. Er... I should know how to get there... But can I check again? - Please do. - Thanks, sorry. Er... Oh no, not again! I'm sorry. Why does it do that? Maybe your beauty messes up my GPS. I don't have that power. But, you know... Let's take a walk and look for it. I'm sorry. Oh? Did you do something again? Nope. What can I order next...? A gizzard shad, please. Yes, Ma'am. Overflowing salmon roe, please. One overflowing salmon roe. I thought we wouldn't meet again. Why? A guy like me, going out with a beauty like you... It's unreal. What? We're here together. It is real. You're right. It's real. Yes. Have you found any good candidate? Er... um, no. It's not a probe or anything. It's just natural... When a beauty like you is marriage hunting. I don't mind, really. I'm thankful to be here. Meeting you as a candidate is enough to make me happy. I haven't met anyone. That's no good. Meet a lot of people! You must find happiness. You're really weird. Wow! Amazing. It really is. Have you been there before? A few times. No, I'm lying. It was the first time, sorry. But it was very good. Yes. Thanks for treating me. It's OK. You paid last time. I like you even more now. What's that? You're so reliable. Also, you ate sushi with your hands. My dad taught me sushi must be eaten with your hands. A woman doing it looks so cool. But maybe it's because it's you. Sorry, I'm doing all the talking again. It's OK. Thank you for tonight. Can I contact you again? Of course. Let's go there again. I'll treat you next time. Good night. Good night. Take care. Takako, sushi must be eaten with your hands. Really? You hold it, and lightly dip the fish side in soy sauce. If you put the fish side on your tongue when you eat, it tastes much better. Hmm. So first... - You flip it. - I flip it, hold it... And put soy sauce on this side. With chopsticks, the rice breaks up. Yeah. It tastes nicer! See? You cut spring onions this way. Totally different from the wife. Huh? Whose wife? What do you mean? Oh? Didn't I tell you? You're married. Is it bad? I wish you told me after we ate. Go home. I guess... I'll go. "(YATABE) SORRY FOR THE LATE REPLY" "I'M OUT DRINKING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" Good evening. Long time no see. Sorry for not replying. I forgot what you looked like. Don't be so harsh. Been drinking? What do you drink? A mojito, please. Make it light. "KANA" First come, first served? It's not like that. She's just a friend. I don't mind. How's marriage hunting going? Fine. Things look good with one guy now. I see. How about you? Me? Who knows. You don't want to get married, do you? If I say I'm fine like this for the time being, would you think there's no point in seeing me? I've been thinking that for a while, so it's fine. You're quite contrary tonight, huh? Takako. Takako. It's almost 2 o'clock. Let's go. The bill, thanks. Want some water? Some water, please. Did you fall for me? What am I doing? "YATABE" "(YATABE) ANSWER THE PHONE." "DID YOU GIVE ME A BOGUS NUMBER?" "(TAKAKO)URBAN PLUM #905 3-9-1 NISHI-MUKOJIMA, SUMIDA-KU" "THAT'S MY ADDRESS" "(YATABE) OK" It's late. I've been waiting for ages. Yeah. Sorry, did I wake you up? I'm off. Must wake up early. Call me. I guess... I just wanted to have sex. Useless bitch. Die. They're holding hands. What happened? Are you in I wanna die-mode again? You started smoking again. And that brand! Was it the guy before last's? No, actually... Three guys ago. You look pretty bummed. Beer? Excuse me. Two beers, please. Yes, Ma'am. I found something interesting. But maybe I shouldn't show it to you today. That dentist called Yatabe you told me about. Here's your beer. I looked him up on Facebook and found his ex wife. Looks like they divorced because of other women. She sounds pretty hysterical, but... Read this. "I KEPT REFUSING TO SIGN DIVORCE PAPERS" Looks like she had no intention to divorce. Why are you doing this? Because I don't want you to marry the wrong guy. The other one, er... What's his name? I just can't remember. Do you know where he works? What do you want me to do? I have the right to decide who I date and what I do with them! Why are you being so nosy? That's sick! So why do you keep telling me every single detail? Put yourself in my shoes. You want to die? You want to get married? Bullshit. You're beautiful, you should be thankful! Being beautiful doesn't guarantee happiness! You're at it again. Why can't you be humble? Why do I have to deny it every time you say it?! That's your real nature. The unhappy princess. Can you stop playing the victim? In your mind, you're convinced beauty will bring you happiness. But I am unhappy! Only married men approach me. My whole life is going and coming to and from work every day! You're not unhappy at all! You're doing what you like. If you don't like it, just quit. It's as simple as that. Since you're married, you have time for yourself. If I had all your spare time, I'd be already married. Spare time? You know nothing about marriage! Could you spend hours making tons of pickles you'd never eat? - You don't have to! - I do! I must do as the old hag says! You could never get married! I know, because I am! You just can't! There's nothing you can do that I can't. I'll get married. The phone you have called may beswitched off or outside the service area... Hello? It's Mom. Are you coming to see us this month? No idea. Any food you'd like to eat? Let me see. I'll think about it. If it takes time to make, tell me in advance. Why don't you bring your husband too? I'll think about it. OK. Do you remember Madoka Niiyama? She's going to haveher second child soon. Yeah? You're already 34.You must hurry and have a baby. Right. I'll do it when I feel like it. You'll be too old, if you keep saying that. Talk about it with Takahisa. I'm sure his parents want a grandchild too. Oh, shut the hell up! I'll sue you for violation of human rights, old hag! Your dad wanted another boy, you know. So give him a grandson as soon as you can. Just shut up! I told you I'll do it if I want! I'm just worried about you. Just die! I'll have some too. I generally like to... do things in the right order. But... I guess you have your own order to do things too. That's why I'm here. Takako, I seriously want to date you with the intention to get married. I'll take a shower. OK. "YATABE" Takako. Even without make up you're so beautiful. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so useless. There are no shortcuts in love. I finally realized... I just wanted to fall in love. I was dying to fall in love. Ms. Aoki. Please go on in. Thanks. Please wait a moment. Ms. Aoki, what can I do for you? You startled me. Sorry I didn't answer the other day. I did call you back. Were you busy? No. I see. I'll recline the chair. I came to say goodbye. That's unexpected. Do you feel any pain? Not anymore. I'm fine now. Do you have time today? Can we talk? Takako. All-clear, I guess. Goodbye. I... don't want to die anymore. You worked hard. It's cold! Making pickles in the winter is sheer hell, isn't it? Wanna see my line chat with my husband yesterday? - Food. - Don't think so. - On my way. - You're not. - Treat me nicely! - You're hateful. Liar. - R.I.P. - Pretty stupid. Don't come back. Over. You say that to each other? That's married life. Never heard of husband & wife jeering word chain? What? It was a word chain? Incredible. Keiko. Thank you for always talking with me. Talk to me about anything. I will. You too, Takako. Yeah. Takako. What? I started drawing manga again. Huh? Nice! Great! I got married but I still have a dream. No spare time at all. Sorry. It's OK. What kind of story? It's about you. Wha-? A comic about me? Huh? Wait... It's delicious. "Let's walk swinging..."
