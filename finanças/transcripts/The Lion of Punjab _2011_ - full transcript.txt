Greetings to all my fellow Indians. Now another astonishing news by IBM 7. Thousands have died of cancer in the Malwa area of Punjab. Why are people from this area suffering from cancer.. The reason is very sensational. Research revealed that the water.. ..of this place contains a large quantity of uranium. The same uranium that is used to make nuclear bombs. 'We aren't saying so.' 'This is mentioned in the research done.., '..by Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar.’ 'According to that there is uranium..' '..in the water, fruits and vegetables in Bhatinda.’ Bindra! Bindra! 'It has caused a lot of people to suffer from cancer.' Bindra! 'According to the experts the uranium..' '..is coming from the ground water.’ 'This water is used for drinking as well as watering plants.' 'Thousands of villagers drink this poisonous water.' 'According to Guru Nanak Dev University..'.. ..the water contains 138 micrograms of uranium..' '..in every litre of water.' 'Whereas, per kilogram of wheat contains..' '..111 micrograms of uranium.' 'This has caused the locals to suffer.. ..from head, lungs, bones and intestines.' I'm sorry to say that he is suffering from cancer. - Cancer? 'It's obvious that if this isn't looked into immediately..' '..the consequences can be more dreadful.' 'But the Badal government is waiting..' '..for the problem to escalate.' These people know that this isn't water, but poison. In spite of that they are helpless to drink it. This water is slowly killing people of the Bhatinda district. With Amreen Teja and Gaurav Manik.. ..this Amit Chaudhary from Malkana, for IBN7. What is he saying? He is talking about uranium. The root cause of this is the factories.. ..on the outskirts of the village. All the poison is coming from those factories. My sister lost her legs. So many people have died in our village. You guys don't support me.. Otherwise, I would've blown up these factories. We lost three buffaloes as well. I've made all the arrangements. The goods are ready. These guys aren't supporting me. Convince them. I am with you. Brother, I too am with you. Fine then. We too are with you. Let's go for it. We are good with those who are good. Otherwise, you can ask everyone. Or else, you can ask God. Learn it if you want to. Note it down if you want to. The ones who are unconquerable are the lions of Punjab. Learn it if you want to. Note it down if you want to.

No. These five confess their crime in front.. ..of the council of five villages. Tell us what punishment should they get? They should apologise to the council of all the five villages. And they should say in front of everyone.. ..that they won't make such a mistake again. We didn't know what we were doing. Buddy, you are considering us to be criminals? Moni, I know. In the last ten days.. ..ten buffaloes have died drinking the village water. Your sister suffered from a paralytic attack. Instead of thinking about her marriage.. ..you are doing all these wrong things. All diseases are spreading because of the chemicals.. ..that are coming from the factories.. ..and going into the river. - What we were doing was right. Don't say such wrong things. - They are right. I am Amrit. The chemicals from the factories are poisoning the water. If we don't do anything now we'll all.. ..die of some or the other diseases. What Moni and his friends have done is the right thing to do. The factory should have been exploded with a bomb. It should've been exploded with a bomb. Well done, terrorist. I thought you are educated. You have brains. You would say something sensible. But you sound uneducated like them. Had they exploded the factory.. ..the chemicals in it would've destroyed.. ..everything within the radius of 25kms. Educated fool. Avtaar, you are right. - What am I saying right? Sir, you are the head of the council of five villages. At least sometimes give good suggestions. We have written to the water board. Tell us what else we should do? - Water board won't do anything. The minister Balwant Rai won the elections from our village. He is our man. You should go and meet him. You should tell him what your problems are. But no, you cannot do that. - Then why don't you go meet him? What do you do the village anyway? Why should I go and meet him. I have a lot of other things to do. What work do you have here? You roam around idle. What? - You cannot read the board on the bus. People say A for apple and he says A for book. He will go to Chandigarh to meet the minister? Hey girl, what are you saying? My son is a lion. The lion of Punjab. He never harassed anyone. He never eyed any girl. He might not be educated but he has that in him. What is that? - That which can make the world go round. Fine. - What fine? If you are so educated, why don't you.. ..go to Chandigarh with him to meet the minister? Speak up. - She talks. - You have gone silent now. Who is it that is talking like this with my sister? My sister is no ordinary girl I tell you. I have an idea. We will go together. We'll go and talk to the minister. I will go with her. - Hear that. He will go with her. Brother, have you made the arrangements to go to Chandigarh? Shut up. This isn't a joke. I too am concerned about our village. He alone is worried about the village. Brother, keeping your hands in your.. ..pockets doesn't resolve issues. - You need to work on them. I'll do it. I'll do it and show it to you. You'll do it. You will go there and start singing. So, what's wrong with that? Avtaar, you go to Chandigarh and meet the minister. And put an end to this trouble. So the council has decided that.. ..you three will go and meet the minister. And the people from all five villages.. ..will make arrangements for you to go there. We will write an application and.. ..take everyone's signature on it. You too will sign? This is what I have learnt to sign my name for. I don't have bank cheque books to sign on. Okay. Okay. Here you go. -Okay. Okay. You sign it as well. -I will. There is time. How long does it take to sign? Do it now. Hey, if I want I can sign for everyone in the village. Then do it. -Why are you so bothered? Why are you insisting on it? -Yes, Son. Sign it. Show her what all you can do. Do it, Son. Why are you laughing? My son is a lion. A lion. He never assaulted anyone. She is laughing. I have another idea. We'll buy half tickets. It will save villagers a lot of money. Sure, we will take half of yours. - What? - The ticket. Buddy, I might look dumb but I am smart. -Yes, right. Why do you look so sad, Mom? - I am not going there to fight. You take care of brother. Call me if there is a problem. Okay? Son.. - Give him the water. Show this water to the minister. This is the water we villagers are consuming. We will show them well. We will show them how it is affecting us and our generation. Okay, fine. Not a problem. Come on. -Bye. See you, everyone. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. - See you. - Take care. - Bye. Bye-bye. We have reached Chandigarh. Where are we going to stay? Let's find out. - We might get a place in the legislative assembly. No. You know Tiwari from our village? He has a place here. We'll go to his place. Why should we go there? - He is my friend. We should go there. He's from our village. We have to live here only for 4 to 5 days. It's no big deal. He talks in Hindi. - Don't worry. No problem. I'll talk to him. Let's catch an auto rickshaw. - Yes. Brother Babar, please forgive me. I made a mistake, Brother. Forgive me, Brother. Move on. Is there a show going on here? Get going. No. No, Brother. Tell me something. I'm very confused. Are you a reporter or an income tax officer? Instead of filing the notice you printed it in the newspaper. Brother Babar. Brother Babar, please forgive me. You wrote that article against my brother.. ..with this very hand, right? - With this very hand, right? There are no cops in this area? This is a very dangerous place. Didn't you know? Why did you bring us from here? This is a shortcut, sir. That's why I brought you from here. People might fall short in this world.. ..but you keep taking shortcuts, young man. How much? - Rs.100. Pay him. Money is kept in it. Count it. - What do I need to count in a Rs.100 note? Check the signs. Check the wires and all. Check whether it's genuine or not. I checked it. -You did? -Yes. Then give me a receipt? - Receipt for an auto rickshaw ride? You are strange. - Don't they give tickets in the bus? Don't we get tickets for trains? Yes? If you don't give me a receipt I'II.. ..have a problem in the village. How will I tell the council that I gave you money? They are strange people. They are stealing from people. Where are you? I said where are you? Oh, my friend, I got your fragrance. Oh, my friend, I got your fragrance. I got it. Hey, have you eloped with her? You both used to fight a lot when you were young. I think now you have started loving her. I think you wish to marry her. But today the registrar's office will be closed. Shut up, Tiwari. You think I'll marry this stupid girl? -Then? We are here to meet Balwant Rai. To complain about the water we are getting in our village. So, this is Amrit (nectar)? - I am Amrit. My name is Amrit. - This isn't nectar. This is poison. We want to make it as pure as the water in Harminder Sahib.. ..and take it back. Come on then. I'll take you all. Pick it up, boys. Pick it up. -Wait a minute. He asked you to pick up the luggage, not the girl. Come in. Come in. Come in. Welcome. Come in. Come in. Come in. You make a lot of arrangements for your guests. Tiwari, what work do you do? - What will Tiwari do? I am doing a government job. I pray to God and enjoy a good life. I make more money by supplying food than I make in my job. Ladies, where are you looking? Greet them. Some guests have come from the village. Hello. - Guests are hungry. You are not done cooking. Now what will Tiwari do? Hurry up. We need to go and meet the minister as well. The sooner we give the application.. ..the sooner the factories will shut down. Oh, God. Keep showering your blessings on us. There is one God. His name is true. There is one God. His name is true. There is one God. His name is true. God Almighty. God Almighty. You are the only king of this world. God Almighty. God Almighty. You are the only king of this world. When I wept at your doorstep.. When I wept at your doorstep.. All the darkness faded away and.. ..the light of knowledge spread. All the darkness faded away and.. ..the light of knowledge spread. All the darkness faded away and.. ..the light of knowledge spread. All the darkness faded away and.. ..the light of knowledge spread. -God Almighty. God Almighty. You are the only king of this world. God Almighty. God Almighty. You are the only king of this world. Get up. Sir is here. - No, don't. They severed your hand. Constable, what do they think? Is the police dead? Yes, sir. - Shut up. Idiot. So, tell me, how are you doing? Is everything alright? - Yes. They severed your hand. You say everything is fine? Hey, what are you chitchatting over there? Come here. You need to note down the statement.. ..but you are nicely chatting over there. So, tell me, who severed your hand? - No one. - No one? Then where is your hand? I had an accident with a truck. You are lying. Your hand was severed.. ..on the road in broad daylight whereas you say.. ..that you had an accident with a truck. Do you think I am mad? The police is dead? Oh, God. - What should I write, sir? What is there to write? Take out the report he had made. Look at this. This is the report you had made. Against Indermohan Babar. You have mentioned all his illegal work in it. Because of which they severed your hand. No, sir. The truck.. Be courageous. Be courageous. Tell me the truth. I am here to support you. Inspector, I can do without a hand. But if they kill me, what will my wife and kids do? Why are all of you such cowards? If you give me a truthful testimony.. ..I will arrest all of them. Were you drunk when you wrote this report? Or were you high on drugs? -Didn't you feel scared then? Doctor.. you should kill such people with injections. You call yourself a man? Nonsense. You are useless. Useless. If you aren't, Babar and his men will make you one. Let's go. He is here. - Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Satnam, you here? You should have directly come into my room. You are like your father. Simple and decent. Sir, we heard you are going to Delhi to discuss inflation. Well, I.. - Sir.. ..I feel this time you will surely find a solution. Look, I am going there with a lot of hope. Well, the world lives on hope. Excuse me, sir. - Billa, you? Here? Yes, I work here. - Our Billa. We too are here to meet sir. Hurry up then. He is going to Delhi for some work. Let's go. - Billa, cops get fat tummies.. ..and you are growing moustaches? - It's the new style. - New style. Sir, for your party's well-being.. ..you are supporting Mr. Satnam.. ..in the forthcoming assembly elections. Is it true? You all are well aware of freedom fighter Gurinder Singh. He served our nation selflessly. To give his example will be an insult to him. We are making his son, Satnam Singh.. ..stand for the elections in his assembly area. It will be good for the country as well as his constituency. I hope you all will.. support him. Hello, sir. We.. Sir, we have come from his village. -Let him go. Hello, sir. We are from village Tiriya. -Come here. Come here. - Hello, sir. We have come from village Tiriya. We wanted to talk about the water in the village. Sir, our river's water is getting polluted. There is a factory over there. It is polluting the water of our village. Villagers are very upset. Factory? Water? I'm going to Delhi for some very important work. Do one thing. Get a file ready on this and give it to my PA. I'll have a look at it when I come back. Okay. - Do one thing. Take the file from them. -Okay. Forward it to me when I return. - Okay. I'll meet you. Okay. Okay. Sure. Thank you. - No. You don't need to thank me. I'll look into this once I return. - Long live Balwant Rai. Long live.. - Balwant Rai. Long live.. - Balwant Rai. You didn't know the minister's programme.. ..before we left the village? Hev, you are talking as if I am his PA. Is this the way to talk to a girl? Is she your buddy? Talk to her properly. - It just comes out. How many times have I told you? It just comes out. My name is Amrit. - You are just too much. He has gone out for a few days. He hasn't gone there for four years. But we don't have any money. Villagers sent us here with money enough only for two days. I say the minister will come when he has to come. Why don't we go and see the Taj Mahal? Brother, it's in Agra. It's not here. - He wants to go sightseeing. I won't let you waste villager's money. If you want to go sightseeing, spend your own money. If I have to spend my own money then forget it.. Why bother seeing Taj Mahal. It's just another tomb. Go. - No, let it be. Go sightseeing. -There is nothing special about Taj Mahal. Brother, here's a rose. Today, I will put this rose on Jassi's hair. Sister-in-law has gone to the market. Don't worry. But Brother, I don't get this. Why do you want to put a rose on her hair? Stupid, you should put a rose on.. ..the tresses of the one you love. There she comes. Jassi is here. She is looking so sexy. Don't get so excited. Go, wash your face. She is your sister-in-Iaw number two. Hi, Jassi. -Hi. Today, I wish to express my feelings to you. I want to gift you a rose today. But I have henna on my hand. Oh, God. What should I do? You have henna on your hand. Do one thing. Turn around a little. I'll put the rose on your hair. Turn around a little. Turn this way, please. Get lost. How do I woe this modern girl? What will Tiwari do if she falls for someone else? Oh, God. Sir.. What happened, sir? What happened? What happened? Where did you want to keep the sack? In that truck. -In that truck? Wow. WWF. Are you going to school? Nice uniform. Your token had fallen down. Badge? -What? Actually, I have henna on my hands. Will you put it on me, please? But where? -Here. -Here? Here. What happened? Nothing. You are very handsome. What will happen to us? Hey. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Henna on your fair hands. Henna on your fair hands. Henna on your fair hands. Your henna tells me something. It tells me something. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Henna on my fair hands. Henna on my fair hands. Once I put it on, it doesn't come off. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. You are not in love. Why did you apply henna? Why did you start dreaming? Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. You are not in love. Why did you apply henna? Why did you start dreaming? You are not in love. Why did you apply henna? Why did you start dreaming? Don't say such things. I won't tolerate this. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Don't say such things. I won't tolerate this. Your henna tells me something. It tells me something. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Oh, beautiful, you have great style. Girls like you truly don't belong to anyone. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Oh, beautiful, you have great style. Girls like you truly don't belong to anyone. Oh, beautiful, you have great style. Girls like you truly don't belong to anyone. I have another trait. I just go for it. Your henna tells me something. It tells me something. Henna on your fair hands. Henna on your fair hands. Your henna tells me something. It tells me something. Henna on my fair hands. Henna on my fair hands. Once I put it on, it doesn't come off. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Fair. Why is everyone laughing? What happened? Wait right there, Avtaar. Avtaar, I won't spare you. Avtaar, I won't spare you. Stop, Avtaar. Stop. Come here. Avtaar. Avtaar, stop. 'Brother Babar, forgive me.' Look at a girl with a moustache. What do you think? This moustache will make a man? You will mess with me? You naughty.. -No, no. It's not her mistake. It's my mistake. You.. you.. Sorry. Sorry, Brother. It's our mistake. You.. you go away. I'll handle him. Avtaar, stop. Stop. Stop, Avtaar, stop. Remove your hand. Remove your hand from his chest. Don't fight. Brother. Brother, let it be. Spare them. What did I do, Brother? -You guys are new here? Yes Brother, they are new here. Look.. Shut up. -Come, Avtaar, we don't want to fight. Come. Param. Come here. -Come. Come. Let's go. Keep him calm. Otherwise, I'll teach him a lesson. These guys are bad. We shouldn't mess with them. What will Tiwari do if they do something untoward? What happened? Is there a problem? Joken Was trying to act smart with me. We'll teach him a lesson. Such goons should be handed over to the police. And you were begging before him. You don't know. Keep quiet. You don't know who they are. Who are they? They are the co-operator Indermohan Babar's brothers. Who is Indermohan Babar? 'Another sensational news for Punjab.' 'Late Gurinder Singh who was famous..' '..for his selfless service..' '..Iast night his son Satnam Singh..' '..was killed by unknown assassins.' 'Police has filed the case and have..' '..claimed that they will nab..' '..the culprits at the earliest.' 'The police have still not been able to unlock..' '..the mystery behind this death.' Did you find out anything? -No, sir. We haven't got any information. The killer must be caught within 24 hours. Hail motherland, sir. -Sir, there is someone here to meet you. Why did you bring him here? Sir, he has been waiting at your home since a long time. He:said he won't leave without meeting you. He:has some urgent work with you. Send him. -Okay, sir. Hey. Hurry up. Follow me. Hello, sir. -Hello. Sir, I was waiting for you. I want to talk to you about something very important. Tell me. -Sir, Satnam Singh's murder.. What? -It was done by Indermohan's brothers. Indermohan's men did this? -Sir, I was at my field.. Let go of me. You.. Why didn't you tell the police? I was scared, sir. That's why I came to you. Hey, why do you need to feel scared? Give me a phone. Here, talk to the police. It's said that in the dirty game of politics.. ..you shouldn't leave behind any evidence or witnesses. But you left a witness as well as evidence. Brother.. I gave you this job because you are good at it. But a person comes and tells me.. ..Sir, I witnessed Satnam Singh's murder. And I have evidence as well. Babar, what would've we done had.. ..that person gone to the police? But you need not worry. I killed that person. I won't pay you for this murder. I'll give you a post. A post. The post of a MLA. And I will support you from outside as well. What do you say? Babar, there is a lot of money in this constituency. But remember one thing. The seat will be yours but the money will be mine. Satnam Singh would have 100% won from this seat. But his victory wouldn't have benefited me in any way. Because neither would he take any money.. ..nor would he let anyone take any money. He would have followed the path of truth.. ..and honesty like his father. That's why I got him killed. But remember, you will get the seat and I will get the money. This is the deal. We will have to do something for Satnam Singh. Do one thing. Declare 'Punjab Bandh' today itself.. ..so that Satnam Singh's soul rests in peace. So that people don't suspect us. Shut down all the shops. Ruin the ones which don't shut down. Move aside. I'm watching cinema. I don't understand anything. True. -I am not sitting with an English newspaper in my hand. I don't need to read it. What happened, Tiwari? You look worried. Babar has shut down the market. You will get into trouble if you go outside. Then what will Tiwari do? I had sent Amrit outside to Photostat some documents. What are you saying? Let it be. Let it be. Don't go outside, Brothers. Don't go outside. What are you doing here? Go inside. Hail.. -Satnam Singh. Hail.. -Satnam Singh. Hail.. -Satnam Singh. Hail.. -Satnam Singh. You didn't close the shop? -My papa has gone outside. He will shut it once he comes back. -Really? Shut it. -What happened? Am rit. Don't you know the market is closed today? I know. A girl and a small boy are inside. Hey. Open it if you have the strength. Open it. Amrit, are you alright? -I'm fine but this child is scared. He should be given some water. What are you doing? What if something would've happened to the boy? Move aside. Shut up. Get lost. I'll slap you if you talk to me like that again. Let go of my hand. -Let go of the sword. Let go of my arm. -Let go of the sword. Let go of my arm. -Let go of the sword. Let go of my arm. Hey.. Listen, what's happening here? We don't know what's happening here. This is the problem. No one knows what's happening. Excuse me.. -Madam. Yes, tell me, madam. Let the girl talk if she wants to. -Quietly come with me. Avtaar, let me tell him. Hey.. Listen, remove your pant and shirt.. ..and wear that girl's Indian dress. What are you staring at? What are you staring at? What are you looking at? Come forward if you are a man. Go. Go. Go and wear a girlie dress. A girlie dress. Coward. Avatar, why did you stop me? He was saying such harsh things. You kept quiet instead of telling him anything? If I would've told the inspector everything.. ..then he would have arrested them. We didn't come here to do all this. -Then why are we here? To keep quiet in spite of seeing something wrong happening? He acts macho otherwise. Go and tell the inspector. They will make you run from pillar to post. Sometimes to the police station and sometimes to the court. Villagers haven't sent us here for this. If I can twist his arm, I can also break his neck. And you, behave like a girl. You have started talking too much. Keep a control over your tongue. Buddy, you cannot build your body.. ..by lifting weights like this. You should move boulders like this. Boulders. You should exercise like I used to. Why don't you get up from there? Come here and pick up a set and see. I'm not feeling well today. I have cold. I'll do it tomorrow. -Yes. I too wanted to build a body.. ..but I don't want to make it like that. I want to have it made by the ones who make.. ..the body of trucks and buses. Because now when I lift a dumbbell, I hurt myself. That's why Tiwari doesn't join a gym. Hello. Hi. Wow. What a body. What muscles! You are looking too good, man. Fantastic. No? Even I want to make a body like you. Like you know the WWF. Can you teach me how to exercise? What are you saying? I didn't get you. He doesn't know English. You don't know how to speak in English? No problem. Let's do one thing. You teach me how to exercise. And I'll teach you how to talk in English. Tell me, what should I do? -Do you want to learn now? Yes. -Then move a little behind. How? -Move a little behind. Stretch your body. How? -Like this. Fill your mouth with air and then release it. Show it to me. I.. I am not getting it. This.. first do this. -Okay. What happened? -Nothing. Forget it. I'll teach you how to speak in English. A for Apple. B for ball. C for Catch. A for Apple. B for ball. C for.. Catch. Catch. -Tiwari, he better mind his hands. He is busy with her. Tell him to be careful. Very good. D for Dance. -D for Dance. E for English. -E for English. And F for.. Forget it, I'll tell you later. You are too young for it. G for Girl. -G for Girl. H for.. Home. -Home. Home means house. -Home means house. Our house. -Our house. My and your house. Our house. I for.. Me. -I for Me. J for.. Jump. -J for Jump. And K for.. Kiss. My son needs a motorcycle. Gift minister a dog. He likes dogs. No, what does the minister have to do? I handle everything. Talk softy. Talk softy. The minister might hear it. I was laughing for him. No, now I was laughing for him. Okay, forget about laughing. -Let's get back to the bike. When are you getting it? Why did you take the letterhead? I feel this will be useful for the villagers. We have to settle the score of the villagers, right? Yes? -From Tiriya. -Tiriya. Here you go. Here you go. Yes? -Sir, people from your village have come here. Who? -You had said that I should make.. ..you meet them when you return. -They are from your constituency. Yes, from Tiriya. -Send them in. -Okay. Go. He's calling you. Thank you. Thank you. -It's okay. Wait a minute. Do one thing. You both go inside. You wait here. I am with them. Brother, there is a saying that the.. ..third one always spoils things. Go on. Hello, sir. -Hello. Come in. Come in. Sir, we had come earlier. You were going to Delhi. You said you will talk to us once you return from Delhi. Tell me. -Sir, there is a lot of water problems in my village. Just a minute. Just a minute, son. Why do you keep saying My village? Say our village. Our village. Sir, all the surrounding villages too are facing the problem. The root cause of it is the factory. Its chemical gets flown into the river. We have a request that you shut down.. ..that factory at the earliest. Otherwise villagers are dying of cancer. They are getting paralytic attacks. They are going blind. Even the cattle have stopped giving milk, sir. This is the application on behalf of the villagers. All the villagers have signed it? -Yes. People from five villages have signed it. Fine. Don't worry. I'll take some action at the earliest. I'll forward your complaint to the pollution board. After I get a report from them I'll make a special.. ..request to the Minister of Industries.. ..on my personal Ietterhead.. ..that action should be taken on this at the earliest. Don't worry. We will shut down this factory. Thank you, sir. Bye. -Bye. Bye. These poor people didn't know that.. ..you are the owner of the factory. You have seen as well as heard what people want. 5000 people have signed this document.. ..to shut down this factory. I'll have to take action. I'm their representative. They have elected me. Factory will have to be shut down. This is a temporary solution. We will have to find a permanent solution. I have found a permanent solution. Really? Very good. 25% profit of the factory will be transferred to your wife. Not 25.. Make it 30. Fine. -You are a very good businessman. Keep your foot down. The minister mightjust walk it.

Oh, no. Someone has already kept it inside. Beautiful, you should have told me. I have lifted a lot of planks. Tiwari, you must have lifted planks. This isn't planks. The planks have been joined together to make this cupboard. Such things can be lifted only by men like me. I don't understand which fool kept the cupboard.. ..in the centre of the room. -The WWF guy. Move aside, Tiwari. Ifl have your permission can I move it from the centre.. ..and keep it at the right place? Move aside. I'll lift the cupboard. Okay, I'll lift the cupboard later.

Earlier in politics there was Gandhi. Now there is only grime. They are still behind Gandhi. Some are after small Gandhi while others are after big Gandhi. What is small and big Gandhi? Small Gandhi is a Rs.500 note. Big Gandhi is a Rs.1000 note. Long live.. -Indermohan Babar! Long live.. -Indermohan Babar! I am so worried. -Okay.

Yes, tell me. -I'm giving you a letter. Please give it to him. -Okay. Actually, my company has bought me a house. That's why I have to leave this house. I love you. WWF. Give it to him. -Okay. -Please. Thank you. She has given a letter. -Do I look like a fool? Was Jassi saying anything? Yes, she left her house. -Did she give anything for me? No. Nothing.

No, I have the written portion with me. I have the written portion with me. I love you. You have it in writing. But this, I can write on my own. I have the actual matter. Wait! Wait! Good. Your brother's life is set. Ifl had come a little earlier Jassi would've kissed me. Are you out of your mind? -I am not crazy. I am telling the truth. I like girls like Jassi.. ..better than girls like you, who keep quiet. Why? -Why? Forget it, I know you very well. You too wouldn't lose an opportunity. You didn't lose the opportunity in the cupboard either. You kissed me. It's good I stopped it otherwise you were on the job. Stop it, you dog. -Dog? Dog. Dog. Dog. We'll have to be careful this time. There shouldn't be a problem during the election.. ..Iike it had happened the last time. Sir, I am worried about only one constituency. And that this Indermohan Babar's constituency. He is standing independently, sir. And he can do anything to win. -Indermohan.. ..you'll have to cast false votes to win the election. Have you made the arrangements for that? Yes, Brother. All the arrangements have been made. Sir, with your permission.. .. I'd like to have the 4 to 5 booths.. ..which are more prone to violence.. ..directly under my control. -Done. Target the areas where there are more voters. But Brother, inspector Balbir.. -Don't worry about him. I'll handle him. Vote for him. Here. Hold it. What's happening? What's happening? -Campaigning is over. Hey, what are you cops doing? Babar's men are scaring people and making them vote for him. And you guys are just watching it happen? Get them out of here. Come on. You, go on. You are giving me your driving licence. I don't want to drive your car. This won't do. Give me some other proof. -Should I get the ration card? Of what help will the ration be? Ration is already so expensive. Do you want to make your children starve.. ..by giving me your share of ration? -What? Show me some other proof. -Will the voter card do? Voter card is what I need. What will Tiwari do if people like.. ..you come with proofs like these? Hello. Tell me, sir. What? Sir, I am needed here. We have already discussed this. What happened, sir? Balwant Rai's pants got torn. I'm going to stitch it. Yes, he is still missing. Yes, we tried calling from a public phone to catch him.. ..but there is still no response. Yes. Yes, no problem. He cannot run away. No one can run away from the politicians. Don't worry. You know what happens in politics. It's okay if we get the person. If we don't get him then we know other means to find him. You know it very well. Yes. Yes. Hello, sir. Are you out of your mind? You are saluting me in front of the public. What will people think if they see this? Show me your service when my brothers will cast votes for me. Got it? Come on, go for it. Handle everything. Come on. You come with me to the next booth. Go. Come forward. You come behind him. Wait. Where are you going? -What is it? You are being too faithful to your duty today. Your inspector has left. Now you too leave. Go away. Look at that. Our man is already here. Ourjob is done. Move. So, how's the election going on? -Move. Get lost. It was going fine until now. But now that you have come.. Move aside, buddy. What is your name? -Sukhwinder Singh. Sukhwinder Singh. Brother, you died two years ago. I am dead? -This is what is written on the list. Two years ago. -What is he saying, sir? He is talking about your soul. You better leave or he will kill you as well. My soul is not dead. I have a right to cast my vote. And I will cast my vote today. Are you leaving or do you want me to make you leave? Brother, you wait. I'll help him cast his vote. Come on, buddy. I'll show you how to cast your vote. We don't have much time. You come here. Quickly get the work done. Quickly cast the votes. Cast the votes. Cast the votes. Lift it. Hurry up. Why are you stopping this election? Lift it. -You don't know? Ink is over and so is the election. Hello. -Hello, madam. It's me. Balwant Rai's PA. Hello. -I've received the report.. ..from the pollution control board. If we get the application, our work will be done quickly. Also get a copy of the application written by villagers. Okay. -Bye. Sister-in-Iaw, where is the key to the cupboard? His key? He took them with him. And he is on election duty today. -Oh, no. What is it? Why did you stop the election? Why aren't you letting people vote? Yes? Okay. So, you are behind this. -Why did you stop the election? The ink is over. -Are you kidding me? The ink is over. Whatever is happening is not right. What is not right? Hey, show him our election symbol. What election symbol? Listen to me. I won't get scared of you. I will make sure that the election takes place. Let me tell you. I will make sure that the election takes place. I will not get scared of you. I will make sure that the election takes place. What's happening here? That too in front of the police. Don't worry, sir. -Why shouldn't I worry? Is this the way.. I won't let this happen. Wait, madam. -Inspector, I wanted to meet Mr. Manoj Tiwari. Manoj Tiwari? Who Manoj Tiwari? He's on election duty. I had very important work with him. He's on election duty here? -Hey.. let the girl come in. Amrit, what are you doing here? Minister's PA had called. Water Board has sent the letter. We need to go meet the minister. File is in your cupboard and the cupboard is locked. I need its key. I'll give you the key right away. -Wait a minute. Here's the key. And go carefully. The situation here is very tense. Go away from here. Go home. Where is your hero? -Who? The one you are always with. -He didn't come. You are eligible to cast a vote. Come on, cast your vote. Let go of me. -Hey, it's your booth. Come on, we will cast our votes together. I said let go of me. Let go of her, Brother. Let go of her. Listen to me.. Brother, let go of the girl. Don't be hasty. Let her go. Really? Sonu, this is the arm that boy had.. ..twisted the other day, right? I'll use this hand today. You have come from the village to trouble us? -To mess with us? Get her. Hey.. Come out, scoundrel. I'll show you. Wait, I'll take you to Tiriya today. You.. Inspector, they can forge my signature.. ..but they cannot forge my thumbprint. That is why I have put my thumbprint on it. My name is Avtaar Singh, son of Joginder Singh Khowale. Tiriya village, Rampura Phul, Bhatinda, Punjab. I lodged a complaint that they have cast false votes.. ..tried to assault a girl and exploded a bomb. You can add any number of sections you want. I'll come to the place and the court.. ..on the day you want me to. I'm ready to testify. If you are a man then take action.. ..against them and arrest them. Or else, I too have many skirts to give people. The ones which you call girlie dress. Wait. When 15 people couldn't hit him. They couldn't fight him. It's not right to attack him from behind. Let him go. God, please forgive me. I'm preparing to send these people to You. Please don't send them down to earth again. Because they aren't worthy of living in this pious world. Hey.. Hey.. do you know on whose brother have you risen your hand? I won'tjust be using my hands but my legs as well. Look, let go of my brothers with dignity. Dignity? Do you want me to leave them with dignity? Beware. I might even arrest and lock you up with them. Look at this. -This isn't an ordinary thumbprint in blood. This is your brothers' death warrant. I have an eyewitness who says.. ..that your brothers have cast false.. ..votes during the election. They threw a bomb. Three people are dead. They even tried to assault a girl. When I will submit this paper in the court.. ..they will be behind bars for life. But if! include your name in it.. ..your political reign will end in a day. Then you too will be counting bars in.. ..the jail along with your brothers. You don't know who you are talking to. Can't you see that you are talking to Punjab police? Hey. I won't spare you. You have thrashed my brothers. Take him.. take him away. Otherwise he too will get thrashed. Yes Indermohan! Brother, inspector Balbir is crazy. He is thrashing my brothers in prison. Why? -He says someone has lodged a complaint against them. He says he will include my name in it. He says he will cancel my election. Indermohan, if you create any problem.. ..in the police station then they will arrest you. That's why, get out of there. What are you saying, Brother? He is thrashing my brothers. Try to understand, Indermohan. How many people have lodged a complaint against them? One person, Brother. One person. One? Get him. Where is Avtaar? -I don't know. -Tell me. Brother, he has gone to meet Balwant Rai. Balwant Rai? Run, my baby. Run. Run. Move on. Move on. Move on. Scared you. You.. Why are we laughing? The reason is that there is no reason. Have a seat. Sit over here. Sit. Call them. Well, the good news is that the water.. ..board has sent its report. Here, I have tears in my eyes because of laughing. It's clearly stated in the report that.. ..the water is getting polluted because of the factory. The ministerjust needs to have a look at it. He was very busy. He couldn't have a look at it. He just needs to sign it. Then I'll send all the files to the industry minister. Once we get an order from there, the factory will close down. Give it to me. I wonder how he can laugh so much. I cannot. Yes, Indermohan. The person who had lodged the complaint is in your office. In my office? -Yes, in your office. What is his name? -His name.. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Soni, give me your phone. Brother, I don't have it with me. At the last moment, you guys.. Sir, Avtaar from your constituency.. Who Avtaar? -Sir, Avtaar Singh. He had come for some water problem. -So? -He has come back. He needs your signature on the application. Who are you talking about? Who Avtaar? What application? Which constituency? -Sir, there was a problem.. ..of water getting polluted. I had forwarded it. It has been signed by the pollution control board. You just need to sign it. Those poor people.. Have you gone crazy? Who gave you the order to forward the application? Yes? You know because of one person's complaint.. ..the counting of one polling booth.. ..can be cancelled, you fool. I have spent millions on Indermohan Babar. Will you make me the money that has got stuck? I, being a minister, cannot get Babar's men released. And you are talking about a village's problem. Get lost. Next time I too will file a nomination. I will fight the election in front of him. If I win, forget making him my PA.. I won't even make him my peon. Go. Go away. Your work won't be done today. It's your case and I got scolded for it. Why, Brother? What happened? Brother, the minister is upset over something. I don't think your job will be done today. Brother, get it done today. We have to go back to our village. Yes. We request you. -I understand. But who will make the minister understand? This is all I can do. Yes. Hello. Yes, Meena? You don't worry about your parents. Look.. look Meena, I am with you. We have the support. We will elope if they don't agree. Come on. Get lost. Hello. -Brother, Indermohan. Yes, Indermohan. -Brother, that person is in your office. In my office? -Yes, yes. What is his name? -His name is Avtaar Singh. Avtaar Singh? -Yes. Hello? Yes, sir. The boy, Avtaar Singh who was just here.. Where did he go? -He left. He left? -He must be at the gate. Go and get him immediately. -Okay, sir. Darn, they don't even let me have lunch. Where are they? Avtaar! Wait. Wait. The minister is calling you. What happened? -Thank God you are still here. You didn't leave. I think you are very lucky. Come in. Come in. -I'm coming. You.. you guys let it be. Go to Tiwari's place. I told him to buy the train tickets. Take the tickets from him and prepare.. ..to leave for the village. -We'II leave tonight on train. Thank God. I knew it will work out. -The minister has agreed. You guys leave. I'll get his signature. Come. -Come on. Bye. -Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Hello, sir. Come in. Come in. Hello. Why are you standing? Have a seat. No, sir. I am fine. -Have a seat. Have a seat. Sit. Sit. Sit. What will you have? -No, sir. I don't need anything. Here, have some water. -No, thank you, sir. Have some water. Why are you hesitating? Here. Drink it. Sir, our entire village is yearning to drink clean water. Now explain it to me. What is your problem? Sir, the problem is the polluted water in our village. Our problem will be solved if you sign on this file, sir. What happened at the election booth? Okay. Okay. At the polling booth. I wanted to come and tell you about this, sir. There is a girl called Amrit who has.. ..come with us from the village. She had gone to the polling booth to get the keys. Some goons misbehaved with her over there. I couldn't tolerate it, sir. Then I did what I should have done. But son, why did you have to mess with these goons? Sir, I too didn't want to mess with them. I have tolerated their nuisance a number of times. They had cast a number of false votes.. ..for their brother Indermohan Babar, forcefully. They killed three innocent people with a bomb. Then I thrashed everyone black and blue.. ..and handed them over to the police. You too should do something about these goons, sir. Before that I will do something. You'll have to do one thing. -Order me, sir. What do I have to do? Take back the complaint you have lodged against them. Give another thumb impression of yours. What are you saying, sir? I am asking you to take back your complaint. Sir, I cannot believe this. What are you saying? Those goons are openly troubling people.. Don't you understand what I am telling you? I am asking you to give me your thumb impression.. ..so give me your thumb impression. Put your thumb impression on it. Sir, these are those goons.. I am asking you to do it for them. Take back the complaint. Sir, we came to you with so many hopes. And you are supporting these goons. They are more important to me. But who are you to ask that? Sir, we have voted for you. We made you win the election. We considered you our brother, s|r. Vote? Brother? Dear, we need your vote once in five years. But to stay in the game of politics.. ..I need these people.. every day. From vacating houses to killing people.. These people help me. When I am in trouble, they shut markets for me. They set buses on fire. Will you do that for me? -What are you saying, sir? Villagers expect you to do good things for them. You mean to say that people won't vote for me.. ..if I don't work for the people? They will get angry with me, right? Do you know how many seats there are in Punjab? Thirteen. If I feel that next time I won't win the election.. ,,then I will stand from some other place. But I will win for sure. After all, we will cast the votes, right? Right, Babu? -Yes, sir. How many votes did you put last time? -1700. 1700. A single person. But why am I telling you all this? Are you putting your thumb impression on it or not? You aren't? Hello. Hello. Hello. I hope you will vote for me this time. And you'll place me with the assembly.. ..election from your area. You will have to vote for me. Don't worry. Our entire family will vote for you. Okay. Thank you. Avtaar, you said so many things to us at the council meeting. Okay. Go, now we will see what you do. This was your file, right? I have shot your villagers. Son, I make so much money from that factory.. ..that the life of the villagers.. ..holds no value in front of it. Get his thumb impression. Give your thumb impression. Hey.. You don't know anything about my power.. ..personality and status. Don't keep him alive. Take his thumb impression and kill him. Come on. What happened? Indermohan Babar's men were here. They were inquiring about Avtaar. He didn't tell them. They thrashed him. I couldn't stand it. I told them that.. ..Avtaar has gone to meet the minister. I am feeling scared. Babar's men are looking for Avtaar. They thrashed me. They beat me. They punched my nose and tell me what could Tiwari do? Amrit, you? -Where is Avtaar? I think Indermohan Babar's men just.. ..took him somewhere in the car. I don't know where. And I think Avtaar wasn't even conscious. This too had to breakdown here. A person is missing. We are looking for a person. You are great. Will we get another auto rickshaw here? I'll try to make it work. Hurry up, please. Have a look. Please do something if you can. It started. -Come on. Get in. -Get in. Let's go, Brother. Stop. Avtaar, what are you doing over here? Are you alright? Can you tell me why did you arrest those three people? And I came to know that you thrashed them. Sir, I arrested the three of them for a reason. Those three had forcefully cast.. ..false votes during the election. And exploded a bomb in a crowd as well. That explosion killed three people, sir. And I have an eyewitness.. .who has lodged a complaint against them. That's why I have arrested them, s|r. The person who had lodged the complaint.. ..has taken his complaint back. Release them. -Sir.. I am confident. That person cannot take his complaint back, sir. I am sure something is fishy. Hey, the DIG is right and you are speaking rudely to him? When he is asking you to release them then release them. Release them. -Okay, sir. If the person who lodged the complaint.. ..comes before me, tell me. Then I will release them. DIG, that person won't come here in his presence. Because he is very scared of him. This person thrashed him for his thumb impression. That person is from my village. -I know him very well. He won't come here in his presence. -Please don't trust him. Mr. Balbir, mind your words. And also keep in mind who you are talking to. Release the three of them and catch the real culprits. Sir, the real culprits are the ones I have arrested. You know how long I was waiting for a witness like him? What's happening, DIG? Why is this man repeating the same thing.. ..again and again like a lunatic? -Hey.. Who did you call a lunatic? Who did you call a lunatic? Officers, take him out. -Who did you call a lunatic? You are a lunatic. Your commissioner is a lunatic. I won't spare you. I won't spare you.. DIG, did you see that? That guy shot at me. You saw it. -You don't worry. I'll take action against him. Stop. Come on, hurry up. -Okay. Avtaar. Avtaar. What happened to you? Are you alright? Please, Avtaar is alright. He:is WWF. Nothing can happen to him. Come on, let's go and sit outside. Let him rest. Come on. Avtaar, all this happened because of me. Please forgive me. Avtaar, I love you a lot. Not from now, but since childhood. Since the time you used to come to my village for schooling. I want.. us to stay together, forever. Is that possible? It is possible, right? Yes? Avtaar, we can stay together, right? Your love possesses magical powers. It took my heart away. Your love possesses magical powers. It took my heart away. Your love possesses magical powers. It took my heart away. I couldn't breathe. It took my breath away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. Your love possesses magical powers. It took my heart away. I couldn't breathe. It took my breath away. Mystical. Mystical. Your eyes are mystical. I, too, my love, take your name.. ..and sigh every moment of the day. Write your name on my heart. Take my name and come running towards me. Love has changed the mood of the place. I feel intoxicated without getting drunk. I don't feel hungry or thirsty anymore. What is this mess? I couldn't breathe. It took my breath away. Your attitude strikes my chords. The world has left me. I am all alone. I have become a wanderer like Ranjha.. ..what is this addiction I have gotten myself into? This is the best thing that can happen. The best thing gifted by God. Your love has made me mystic. I am engulfed in the colours of your love. What's not happened in your love? What all have I been through. I couldn't breathe. It took my breath away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. It took it away. Your love possesses magical powers. It took my heart away. I couldn't breathe. It took my breath away. Announcement has been made. We won! Indermohan wins the election. You don't need to do all this. Let's quietly and decently go back to our village. I'll talk to the villagers. No, Brother. No. I won't leave so soon. I still have a lot to do over here. Buddy, these people are very powerful. We are ordinary people. You know what ordinary means, right? These people can have us for breakfast. We cannot fight with them. -Why can't we? What's so great about them? We make them big. People like you and me. We have given the position that he is enjoying right now. We remember that but they tend to forget it. He has forgotten it, right? I'll remind him. I have got an idea. -Brother, you keep your ideas to yourself. I know everything. -Hey at least listen to what his idea is. I feel this girl is smart. Tell me, why did they hit you? -There you go. Hear that. You too know why they thrashed me. After the story is over he is asking.. ..me who was starring in it. -You are great. -This is the point. The game they played with us.. -Yes. Now we will play the same game with them. How so? -They took your thumbprint.. ..on a piece of paper and got their men released.. ..right? -Yes. -Now we will right a fake letter and.. ..and get him trapped in a case of corruption. He is corrupt. He is a thief. A thief. He is getting a lot of money from the factory. -He was telling me. Brother, I really liked your idea.. ..but for that we will need his letterhead. And we don't have it. -You don't have it. I have it. Where? -I've made arrangements for that. I had stolen two Ietterheads from his office. I thought I'd note down the expenses for the villagers. I didn't know that we would settle.. ..his scores on his letterhead. That's a very good idea. -You liked it? Then they do something like this.. ..when they like something, right? You don't need to get so excited. 'Today's headlines.’ 'CM honoured Punjab's minister Mr. Balwant Rai..' '..for his best performance.’ 'This is the first time anyone in..' '..Punjab is getting this honour.' 'You have become the best performing minister in India.' 'Thank you.' 'I am happy that a person from my political party..' '..is getting such a big honour.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' -Send a letter to the media. Tell them that they should focus all the coverage on me. Okay, sir. CM sir, there is good news. 500 to 1000 people of the opposition party have joined us. 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' -'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' Welcome, sir. Sir, I have informed the media personnel.

Long live.. -Balwant Rai. -Enough. Enough. We had Avtaar killed, right? -What are you saying, sir? A person can escape death but not Indermohan Babar. Then why can I see him again and again? Sir, I think you had a little too much to drink last night. The stench is still coming from you, sir. When you drink imported quuor.. ..you start seeing things of the past. Sir, I suggest you think before you speak.. Otherwise all these people will go back to their party. Careful. I have brought a shawl for the minister. I want to gift it to him. Dear.. Avtaar has taken a new avatar. Now see how this one voter changes your future. You are very proud of your status, power and position? Now Avtaar.. -Hey.. Blessed are those.. -Who take the name of the Lord. Will ruin.. Blessed are those.. Who take the name of the Lord. -Your power and position. Blessed are those.. -Who take the name of the Lord. Blessed are those.. -Who take the name of the Lord. Blessed are those.. -Who take the name of the Lord. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Hello, sir. Sir, I want your autograph. Please. Sir, I am a big fan of yours. I have attended a lot of your public meetings. Thank you so much, sir. Darn. What happened, Brother? Is everything alright? Nothing is alright. Today that boy gifted me a shawl. A shawl? Who? -Avtaar. Your father. He is alive? -How is that possible, Brother? We had made him lie on the tracks. Did you kill him or treat him? Great. The one protected by God cannot be killed by anyone. Shut up. -Now no God can save him. Find him and kill him today itself. 'Hello, Mr. Chadha.' 'I got the money you had sent me.' 'Thank you very much.' 'Now you can put as much poisonous chemical..' '..into the river as you want. It will make no difference.’ 'I am very happy that you have fulfilled your promise.' 'And I have done what I had told you.' 'I will support you and your factory..' '..will keep running like it used to.' 'Now even if the villagers make requests or protest..' '..or the report of the pollution board is against you..' '..I will support you.' 'Life of the villagers holds no value to me.' 'I'II change all the reports of the..' '..pollution board in your favour.' 'We have to play a big game together.' 'Money is money.' 'Plant more factories like this one.' 'I am with you.' 'Give my regards to your wife and children.' 'Balwant Rai.' Strange. He has sent such a letter to print? Who is it? Hello? -Yes.. ..this is Sandhu the editor of the newspaper 'Jagbani'. Yes, Mr. Editor? You have sent a letter to print. Should we print it? Have I sent it to eat snacks on it? I have sent it to print so print it. No, but did you read the matter on the letter carefully? Listen, print it or I'll send it to another newspaper. Then don't question me. No, it's not so. We will print it. We will also print the minister's photo with it. Yes, that's better. Please the minister. Okay. Down with.. -Balwant Rai. Down with.. -Balwant Rai. Down with.. -Balwant Rai. Give me Jagbani's number. Yes! Oh no. Hello. -Yes, speaking. What? What? CBI? Really? Okay.

This is Sandhu the editor of the newspaper 'Jagbani'. With whose permission did you print that news? What? What news? Who are you? This is Balwant Rai. Who are you? Sir, I had spoken to your PA. He told me to print the letter. I told him that there is something wrong with the letter. But he said that if you don't print it.. ..then he will send it to some other newspaper. What did he say, sir? -This is what he said. Hello. -So, how are you? Avtaar here. You used to talk a lot about status and position. It is all ruined. The stench of your status is all over Punjab. If you have courage then come in front of me and talk. I'll come before you. You were saying what can a single voter do? Didn't I get you into trouble? Didn't I.. What did he say, sir? -Get lost from here. 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' 'Long live.. -Balwant Rai.' Stop. Stop.

We:cannot say anything for the next 48 hours. The chances are very slim. You just pray to God. How are you, my lion of Punjab? -I am fine but.. But what? But look at me. Do:you think I am crazy? He.. he says I am crazy. All the doctors say that I am crazy. But I don't mind it. They have even convinced my family that I am crazy. My wife, my kids.. They all think I am crazy. I made an attempt.. to get out of their trap.. but I couldn't. Otherwise, I would've ruined them. Do you still want to ruin them? Hello, sir. -Hello. Gujral, your badge is not pinned properly. Pin it properly. How are you, Darshan? -Fine, sir. How are you? Everything's fine. -When did you join duty? Just now. I have been called here for some work. No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't shoot my brother. Hey.. Hey.. Brother Balwant, I have done what you had ordered. I killed all three of them. I.. I.. -You.. you ordered him to kill my brothers? You killed my brothers. The colour of blood is red. The colour of blood is red. I won't spare you. The colour of blood is red. The colour of blood is red. DIG, arrest Balbir Singh. Arrest him. -Sir.. He has gone crazy. -Sir.. He has killed three people. -Sir, we cannot arrest him. Why can't you? He's a mad man. You yourself had testified this in the court. He is mad. Move aside. Come on. Let's go. Wait, sir. Even our villagers are.. ..very thirsty to drink clean water. But perhaps you are not bothered about it. Stop the car. -Don't stop the car. What happened? Your man caught your neck, today. You know it was me who gave your neck in his hand. You.. -Mind your tongue. Mind your tongue. It was me who sent inspector Balbir as well. You have already lost your status. Now your biceps, I mean your power is also over. Now all you are left with is your position. I have nailed that as well today. Save yourself if you can now. Stop the car. Your village is here. Take him to a cycle repair shop.. ..and get the puncture repaired. What is this? What is this, Balwant Rai? What is this? Brother.. It's nothing. I know everything. Indermohan Babar got our party's candidate Satnam Singh.. ..murdered and won this election and.. ..that too on an independent ticket. And after that you are drinking at his brother's wedding? You are dancing? You should feel ashamed. Party members had asked me to suspend you.. ..the day the corruption enquiry started on you. I am calling a general body meeting tomorrow. We will have to take a decision on this case. And I am sure that that decision won't be in your favour. Perhaps.. this might be your last.. ..general body meeting with us. Sir, I heard you are the chief guest in tomorrow's meeting. Getting angry won't help, sir. That villager has removed your pants. Slapping me won't do you any good, s|r. Call a press conference. And tell the public that that letter was fake. Don't talk like a fool. That letter was fake but my signature on it was real. By now the CBI must have dug deep.. ..into the chemical factory case. What will we do now, sir? Avtaar has.. It is a very old saying. But what is said is very true. I am the principal of the school he is studying in. I won't let him clear in my presence. I'll get my status, position and power back, within 24 hours. Why is he doing this? His game is over. He won't get players to play this game with him. And if he plays this game alone then it'll hold no value. Hello. Sir, all of a sudden you went on a hunger.. ..strike for the sugarcane issue? Not all of a sudden. I have been feeling the pain of the farmers.. ..because of low pricing of sugarcane since a long time. And I am not a leader who will keep quiet. This strike will go on till the government.. ..doesn't sit up and take notice. What does hunger strike have to do.. ..with sugar mills and sugarcane? This is a very disgusting question. From what is sugar made? -Sir, from sugarcane. Then why is sugar priced more that sugarcane? If sugar belongs to the government.. ..then sugarcane belongs to the farmers. Government cannot produce sugar if.. ..the farmers don't grow sugarcane. Am I right? -You are absolutely right, sir. Then why does the farmer get less.. ..price for sugarcane than sugar? I want the government to take notice of this. Even if! have to die because of that. Well, according to me, no politician in India.. ..has ever died of shame or of hunger. But he will surely die. Even if! die. -Sir.. Hello. -Don't worry, sir. I've sent my factory workers dressed.. ..in khaki for your support. I'm spending a lot of money on it. You shouldn't think about money.. ..when you are thinking about the welfare of the Sikh temple. But sir, you are all alone in this. Won't anyone else support you? If any leader of Punjab has ever respected Punjab.. ..or those who have Punjabi blood flowing in their veins.. ..will surelyjoin me in this fight. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. CM sir, more players have joined him. If this continues he will win the match. He is smart. I will have to do something quickly. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. -Long live.. -Balwant Rai. He has covered a lot of mileage We will have to end his hunger strike. Make arrangement for the juice. Your husband is treated as badly.. ..as a dog at Balwant Rai's place. Sorry, I think I said less. His condition is worse than that of a dog. Balwant Rai shouldn't do this with brother. Yes, you are right. He is a very bad person. And my husband is very nai've. Brother, you do one thing. I am about to call him. Keep a gun on my head. I'll get the feeling of a gun. Okay, I'll keep a gun. A gun is no big deal. Wait a minute. Let me make two barrels. Okay, the two barrels are ready. It's said that if you have to make up a story.. ..then you should take all the liberty you want. Sir, the CM has left his office. He will reach in some time. Excuse me. Hello. Yes, tell me. Listen, Avtaar's men have kept a gun over my head. They say that if you don't listen to them, they will kill me. What do they want? What should I do? Turn around. They say Avtaar is standing behind you. So buddy, did you talk to your wife? Yes, I did. But what do I have to do? Just wait and watch the drama. Where's the juice? -The juice? The juice is here? -Yes. For how many people is this juice? -200 people. What are you saying? There are 350 people here.. ..and you have broughtjuice only for 200 people. Go and get more. Hurry up. You will get me into trouble. Come here. Come here. Do whatever you want to quickly, Brother. I am doing it. Now only God knows how.. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -The CM. Mr. Balwant, stop this hunger strike. No, sir. It's not possible. Don't try to act smart. This matter has reached the PM. I spoke to the people in Delhi and came here. But sir, you were planning to call.. ..for a general body meeting. Mr. Balwant, you played such a big game and cancelled.. ..the general body meeting. Now end this game. Brothers.. Delhi High Command has assured me.. ..that we'll find a solution for the.. ..farmers' problem at the earliest. And I trust the CM's assurance. Under his assurance I end this strike. And I thank you and all the other brothers.. ..who supported me in this fight. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -The CM. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -Balwant Rai. Long live.. -The CM. Sir, you too have some juice. -No. Take it away. Drink it. It is grape juice. -Have it, sir. The grape has been raped. Take it away from here. Sir, you don't drink this juice. -But why? Greetings to all my fellow Indians. My name is Avtaar Singh. I am a small representative of village Tiriya.. ..district Bhatinda. I came to meet minister Balwant Rai.. ..along with my friends with my village's problem. I thought he will solve our problem. But I was wrong. He ignored me considering an anonymous.. ..voter of this country who had made him win the election. When I used to say that this is my village's problem.. ..he used to say, Don't say my village, say our village. Saying so he forced us to drink the poison.. ..which I have mixed in his juice today. The water of our village. The poison that comes out of their factories. We all have to.. Be careful, sir. Don't hurt yourself. The poison that pollutes our water.. ..comes out of the factories.. ..from which they have earned millions. Millions. This is his condition after drinking.. ..water from our village for one day. Consider the state of our people in the village.. ..who drink this water everyday. They are getting cancer, paralytic attacks.. ..but they still think the minister will solve our problem. My son. Today he is telling the world.. ..the problems we are facing. Oh, God. Sitting in air-conditioned rooms, they talk about drought. People who drink mineral water, talk about water scarcity. Water related problems. I gave him a small experience of my village's problem.. ..and tried to divert the country's.. ..attention towards my village. As to what problem my country is facing. Punish me if you feel I have done anything wrong. I am not scared to get punished. -Oh God, protect my son. But yes, now I am sure that my village, my problem.. ..the problem of my village will be resolved. You all will surely pay attention towards it. We are good with those who are good. Otherwise, you can ask everyone. Or else, you can ask God. I won't kill you. The water from our village will kill you. Here, drink it. -I won't drink the water. Drink it. -I won't drink the water.
