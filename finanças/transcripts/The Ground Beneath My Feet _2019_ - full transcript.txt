THE GROUND BENEATH MY FEET "I have not seen daylight yet. Not that I shy away from daylight, but dawn is good for my inner life. It's supposed to heal my soul. It is also the time of year that drapes darkness over darkness. My lashes are closed tightly to shut out the light of life. I don't want to go on. Let me sleep. Let me rest forever. I don't want to see your lights ever again." Wegenstein. Dr Hofegger. Toxicological outpatient clinic. Am I speaking to Caroline Wegenstein? - Is she dead? Mrs Wegenstein? Mrs Wegenstein, can you hear me? Your sister is here. She was awake just now. We immediately pumped her stomach. The poisoning is under control. The psychiatrist has already seen her. Shall we transfer her to the psychiatric ward? Yes. She has these episodes once a year. We have the records on her stationary treatments. But I can't find any information on previous suicide attempts. I don't think she wanted to kill herself. We're talking about a really high dose of tranquilizers. Yes, but she basically eats nothing and takes Zyprexa, Valium, Zolpidem, various analgesics and laxatives. Each with its own side-effects, and when she's not well, she takes the wrong dose. Then she has a breakdown and is committed to a mental hospital or admits herself. She gets new meds and things go well for a while. Can you cover her up again? Will you be here for the transfer? - I work abroad. I thought you were coming at noon. - Did I book the wrong flight? No, I missed it. There was an accident on the way to the airport. Now both pieces fell over. 630 calories. - All right. Fancy a cup of coffee? - I'll get it. Relax! It's your birthday. Okay, who's next? - The candle is dripping... It's on fire now! Will you be here for the conference call? - Of course. Birgit said something private came up. There were problems with the tenants of the apartment I inherited. You look really stupid. The strategy of direct marketing and so on used to make sense. But the Internet has changed the market. - Hands off my reps. Let's face the future and make this company strong again. Let's introduce modern sales channels based on the experience of its long-term staff. And you can be part of it. I've been in this company 27 years now. I became head of this department in '96. You hadn't even finished school then. Mr Giese, just try to see a different perspective. The company needs innovation. Hardly anyone likes changes. But stagnation isn't an option. As long as we breathe, we're constantly changing. People have always assured me that our rep system works very well. It's been doing well for the past 17 years. - Mr Giese... You believe in Zenzius, right? But Zenzius is facing difficulties and it's our job to find a solution. Obviously things will have to change. You know that perfectly well. You have to see the positive side too. We will talk directly to the heads of departments. And you've been part of this company too long to be bypassed. Goodbye. - Have a nice day. You too. She really got on my nerves. I hate it when they start to perspire. You nailed it, Lola. We can keep two thirds of the staff. That was you! You did my job here. By the end of the year, you'll be Associate Principle. Then Sydney. We'll do Browning together. It's going to be a major coup for us. Please hold the line. Your call will be answered as soon as possible. Mrs Wegenstein? - Hello, Mr... Muhr. I'm her primary carer. The transfer went well. Your sister is responsive and being examined now. I can put you through, but don't expect much. But you know the situation. - Yes. My colleague will... - Lola? Just a second. - Hold the line. I just wanted to let you know it's 4:08 p.m. - And? The conference call. Everyone is already waiting. Sebastian says, Degenhardt is in a good mood. - Okay. It took me quite a while until I found out. You can't get anything out of her. She knows how to hide it quite well. Hello, Dr Degenhardt, Mrs Schmied-Steinz and Mr Bacher. Hello, and sorry for the delay. - Hello. Good... Ready to join in. Mrs Wegenstein, I was just asking Mr Bacher and Mr Selikovsky why you hid it from us for so long that you're from Vienna? That's nothing to be ashamed of, is it, Bacher? I didn't hide anything, it just never came up. And that's such a shame. Ask Mrs Schmied-Steinz to arrange a dinner when I'm back in town. And I'll join you, of course. - Great idea. Allow me to outline our plans for you. - May I say something first? HELP ME. THEY HAVE LOCKED ME UP HERE. HELP ME. I had a look at the figures. And before we look into the future, I'd like to discuss a couple of issues regarding past figures. Hey! - Mrs Wegenstein? Er... Yeah, my colleague has already prepared a table containing the accounting details which we will e-mail you. Then we can make sure we're referring to the same data. And if you have any further queries or questions regarding the details, please don't hesitate to contact us. Morning. - Morning. Lola? Conny? - Lola... Are you all right? Morning. Conny, I'll call you back, okay? Promise. Conny? - Morning. It's a standard approach, the usual strategy. A textbook case, if you like. So it's the perfect project for a young, ambitious team. Thanks, Jürgen. Where are we with the negotiations? - I'm on Bacher's tail. He's instrumental in the decision-making processes of the board and the banks. And Elise is very confident that we'll get the job. And who will stay? Just a few. Maybe two. Three max. I get along well with these people. I'm the down-to-earth type. They like that. Sure. It's a bit early to build the team. But Elise will choose those best suited to the job. The decision will be made based on professional competence. Thanks. And you're the judge of that? You need to learn a few things before you can lead a team. And what gives Sebastian the authority to judge my performance? Let's do our work. I've got to go. I have a meeting with the partners. I'll be away for a couple of hours. Enjoy your meal. This is the first thing they've given us to eat. The loony in my room eats the foam rubber under her mattress. She has the right idea. We get nothing from them. You look much better. You're here at last. I'll eat up and then we'll go. You can't leave here now. You're not well enough yet. Pills and infusions all the time. So how should I... I can't anyway. I want sleeping pills, but... Nothing. As a punishment. And they don't even know... ...how many... ...how many and what I took. How many... 120 pills. No way. Really, Conny. That can't be correct. 120 pills? You were dopey and confused and took the wrong dose. But 120? That would knock out a bull. - It was 120 pills. Will you take me, please? Take me with you. Please. I can't. I... They want to keep you here a little longer and you're... You're not well enough yet. I have therapy every afternoon. But it's torture. And if I don't... what they want... I don't think they did that. When no one believes you... I'm sorry. You're right, of course. I'm sorry. I'm sure it's not easy here, but they only want to help you. They want to kill. I'm not allowed to do it myself. But I know who they arranged this with. If you don't take me with you, I'll be dead. Conny, I've got to work. Conny, you'll be better soon. You know that, right? We can talk on the phone, Conny. - They listen in on us. You have to protect me. I'm trying to. But you have to work with me, okay? Listen... The meds will stabilise you. And you know it, if you're honest with yourself. Just take one small step each day, in your own time. Okay? And then you can go home again. Okay? I'll come again as soon as I can. - You're a bad person. You're lying to me. I know very well that you told them to do this to me. You fucking whore! You fucking bitch! You fucking whore! Mrs Wegenstein, you'll be all right soon. Mrs Wegenstein, we'll... We'll fix your legs and then your arms... Lola! - Try to calm down. Oopsie... - Sorry. Were you just with Mrs Wegenstein? Are you her sister? Dr Hoffmann. Hello. Caroline Wegenstein. Don't worry too much. She's much better than you think. What do you mean? It's part of her disorder. The propensity for manipulation, intrigue and drama that we all just witnessed. You mean she got herself restrained on purpose? I know your sister... - I'm going that way. Sure, the exit. I've known your sister since the last time she was here. She is very smart. She shows an incredible resistance to being sedated by medication. She is articulate. She knows the treatment methods here. She is resourceful. That means she knows exactly which buttons to push. She even tries to play off us doctors against each other. But these are all symptoms of her paranoia and not... Running away from therapy again? - Just having a smoke with a friend. Next time I'll put you on the turquoise ward. Turquoise doesn't suit me. Wait a second. Goodbye. I'm sorry. I LOOK DOWN AT MY BODY AND I CANNOT SEE MYSELF. I CAN MOVE, AND I CANNOT WALK PROPERLY. Who are you? You poor thing. Hey, cat. Here's your driving license. Thank you. - Thanks. You haven't filled in the pick-up date. - I want to leave that open. But we need to know when you'll pick her up. - I'll pay for two weeks in advance. Okay. I'll get your change. - No, keep it. All right. Thank you. Very kind of you. Okay then. Say goodbye. - He's... He's been through a difficult... - Separation? I noticed something was wrong. But don't worry. He's in excellent hands here. We have a therapeutic approach here and a change of scenery is best for him now. Wegenstein. Lola? It's me. Are you alone? I... I just... I nodded off in the conference room. Let the others look after the details. Yes, but you know me. I have to do everything myself. I know, honey. I miss you so much. I miss you too. - Will you make it? Well... Yes, sure. We just finished the final presentation. And... - Delegate it! I'm meeting Bacher and Degenhardt the day after tomorrow. Great. The follow-up job is your big break. If we don't get it, you'll be stuck in Hildesheim for eight months. I know. And... - Listen, I have to get back to work now. Don't let the others see your project proposal for Sydney. Yes. Sure. And maybe we can rent a flat together there. - I can't talk right now. I wanted to go over the figures once more. - I'm on it. Were you at the airport this afternoon? Well, I met a client there. He had a stopover between two flights. A client? A prospect client. None of my business anyway. I had some offers, too. And? Maybe when I'm in my mid-thirties. I like the thrill here. Turning everything upside down in just 50 days! That's awesome. I can finish this for you. I can't sleep anyway until this project is through. 48? If you need assistance press the emergency button for six seconds. Wegenstein. - I was strapped to the bed for 14 hours. No water. No toilet. Everything was back to normal in the evening. They even let me have dinner. But I didn't eat. - Conny, they won't harm you. They'll poison me. - I don't think so. You're going through a lot now. - Yes, a lot. I'm trying to survive. You have to help me. - Conny, I'm in Rostock. I'm working here. Conny, are you still there? Why are you still awake? Conny? Excuse me, I can't hear you. Who would you like to speak to? Yes. Hold on a second. Lola, it's for you. Wegenstein. - The cat. I brought him to a pet hotel. It's very nice there. They have a garden, too. Morning. What's his name? - They're hurting me, Lola. Did you get the chart? - Yes, I got it. Down there... - Yes, I see. I need the toilet. Back in five. Otto Wagner hospital. Ward 22. Wegenstein. I want to talk to my sister. She's in a therapy session now. Sorry. Then let me talk to her doctor. The doctor is busy right now. My sister insists that she's being abused on your ward. If you don't let me talk to her doctor right now, I will take legal action. I'll let the doctor know that you want to be called back. But it'll take a while. It's very busy today. My sister keeps calling me and telling me that she's being abused on your ward. I know what you're going to say... - She doesn't make any phone calls. What... What do you mean? - Well, like I said. She's never asked to make a phone call. Hello? We have to go over the case with Elise. - Okay. I... After the meeting. The meeting is already over. - Then leave the print-out on my desk... I wanted to discuss it with you before we... - I just have to... I didn't know you were coming today. - You're so beautiful. I'll put them on now. - Of course. There you go. And I'll put these in here. Can you spare 50 cents? Hey, I'm hungry. - Sorry. Sure, you're sorry. Come on! A rich woman like you... Your shit probably doesn't stink, huh? And compassion is a weakness. - That's not the point! Isn't it? - No. Oh, then it's my own fault. - Yes, probably. How can you know that? I can't. And you don't know anything about me. I do. You're a rich bitch. You sell your soul for money. And you don't give a shit about anyone. And even if you don't get your hands dirty, you're still a fucking cunt! Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Can I take your order? I'll take the tagliatelle with porcini. - Sure. A small one for me. Thanks. - Nothing? I'll take the tuna carpaccio and then a coq au vin. Sure. - Nothing for me. We'll take the club sandwich with fries, the salad with turkey. A bottle of Albariño and mineral... - Sweet potato fries instead... Sweet potato fries instead of normal fries. And a bottle of mineral water. Thanks. At this stage, each phone call can be decisive. Take it. Go on. It's probably Bacher. He always wants to talk in the evening. Wegenstein. Good evening. I can see you. No problem, I'm not busy. Why are you naked? Where are you? - I got myself a mobile phone. I know they're tapping all the phones. That's why I'll get rid of this phone. No one else can help me, Lola. Just you. You're very kind, but you overestimate me. - Cut the bullshit. There's no way you can be in Rostock. Conny, I just want to help you. I want you to be okay. I'm working so I can pay for you once they've let you go. They already let me go. What? Aren't you listening? I've never been braver, Lola. I got on a plane. All by myself. Come back to the window. You could at least wave to me. Lola? Where are you? - Behind you. Do you want to see me or not? I can see you right now. You look ridiculous. Tell me where you are right now, or I'll hang up. I just talked to her. She called me. Someone played a joke on you. Your sister is asleep. And I'm holding the only phone on the ward as we speak. She said she got herself a mobile. Do you hear me? She got herself a mobile. Listen, your sister is on a psychiatric ward. She's been restrained and can't walk out and buy herself a mobile. Okay? That's impossible. - How do you know she's asleep? If you like, you can talk to her doctor tomorrow morning. That's all I can do for you right now. Thanks for your understanding. We can't do anything right now. I've got a sister. But you said you're an orphan and all alone. - I am an orphan and all alone. She... Conny is ill. The cool big sister I once had... ...doesn't exist anymore. - What's wrong with her? Paranoid schizophrenia. She was diagnosed when she was 22. It was a year after my mother died. It was just the two of us. She was my legal guardian. Now I'm her legal guardian. She can't make any decisions or pay bills. Most of the time, she can't leave the house on her own. She's not fit for this life. She has hallucinations, believes in conspiracies... Back then, she told me that our neighbours wanted to take our flat and put me in an orphanage. And I had no idea it was all just in her head. She didn't know it herself. And then, one day I came back from school and she wasn't at home. Then the phone rang in the evening. She was calling from a phone booth. She was on Kennedy Bridge, far away from where we lived. She didn't know how she got there. She was still in her nightgown. Then people did come and put me in an orphanage. She was right after all. We have nothing in common. You'd never think we were sisters. She's your family. - No. I take care of her. As best I can. Morning. - Morning. Can we start? - Yes. Let's start right away. We wanted to put together the team for the final presentation. The board and bank people mainly know me. So we can put the rest of the team together regardless of previous meetings. I'd suggest that I do the introduction. Sebastian talks on key account and partners, Clements on retail and indirect marketing and Jürgen on business case and next steps. Fine. I think that'd gain us a lot of trust if our team was mainly male. It has nothing to do with your qualifications. Everyone here... Everyone here has done a great job and I've made sure the partners know this too. SCHIZOPHRENIA Any questions? Not married, no children, no chronic diseases, no medication. Please describe your condition to me. I think that I have hallucinations. When and why did you come to this conclusion? I received numerous phone calls from a person, who according to others, did not call me. And who were they from? Is that relevant? Are you here in Rostock on business? Yes. What do you do? - I'm a business consultant. Would you describe your current work situation as stressful? Not more than usual. Do you suffer from headaches, dizziness, impaired vision? No. Has there been or is there any history of mental illness in your family? Why are you lying to me? I... Do you suffer from a sleep disorder? No. How many hours do you sleep on average? - Six. More would be better. All right, we'll do a haemogram and an electrocardiogram. I'll be back right away. Mrs Wegenstein. I don't have time for this. The haemogram is just a routine test. Well, I... I just want to rule out any inflammations and deficiencies. I can't do it today. I'm sorry. I think you're over-worked. I really have to go now. Thank you. You can come back anytime. - Okay, thanks. Bye. In other words, it means a harmonisation of formats for data transfer. Meaning there will be no extra work for exchanging data between departments. It also means: less paperwork, less filing, less to and fro between the departments, and also fewer meetings. And less time making coffee for the bosses. - Let's do some straight talking. Everyone here knows why you're here. We knew it the second you came through the door. It's important that the staff is informed of the measures. We know exactly what your company does. How nice for you that you've got a nice job. But believe me: this can happen to you too. Mrs Lubitz, I arranged this meeting for you all to get rid of some rumours and allay your fears. So please, bear with us. Mrs Lubitz, I know what you're hinting at. Your boss has left the company. That's tough and disappointing. Can't you just tell us how many of us have to go? The company you're working for is in a very difficult situation. We're losing private clients. And it's the same with business clients. Over the past three years, the average growth wasn't even one percent. And the measures that we are suggesting here can help to stabilise the situation. And to keep as many jobs as possible. I'm a single mother. You probably don't care, but... Mrs... - Rennecke. Mrs Rennecke, with all due respect and empathy, we can't take into account the particular life situations of each staff member, when it comes to restructuring or saving a company. If it wasn't for us, this company wouldn't exist this time next year. I... I can only promise that I will fight for every single job here. Please, trust me. I'll do what I can. You have to sign this. Sebastian needs it urgently. Mrs Wegenstein is... - I'll get lunch. Pizza or salad? I'm having lunch with Elise. She's already gone. Munich. ALREADY MISSING YOU. E. Steak for the lady. Medium. Another medium for Mr Degenhardt. - Thank you. And one for the gentleman. Rare. Well, enjoy your meal, Mrs Wegenstein. - Enjoy. Fresh from the pasture. To go back to what we were discussing and tell you more about our plan. We have prepared a package for you which will benefit you in many respects. On the one hand, we would relieve you of the responsibility of controlling and pushing forward the measures. And on the other, we'd also take care of coordinating it all with the banks, which would give you and your manpower more time for the daily business. Staff members. - Excuse me? "Manpower" isn't very PC. Isn't that important to you? - You're absolutely right. It was a long day. - Just kidding. Oh, I have to take this. Excuse me. Don't you like the wine? It's very good. I just want to keep a clear head. You don't have to. You're an encyclopaedia on legs. Thank you. Do you exercise a lot? Yes, I do. Sorry about that. We were discussing your package. Exactly. Well, what usually happens is that two or three carefully selected members of our staff, who were also part of the team, stay at your company. They support you in the initial phase. We also coordinate the various departments with our implementation tool, monitoring the progress... And who would stay with us? If you decide to contract us with this job, which I naturally highly recommend, then Mrs Ludwig and I will choose one or two members of our team. We would of course involve you in the decision. Would you be one of them? - I can't guarantee that. In other words, no. My colleague obviously appreciates the Austrian spirit. We have another Austrian in our team. He is highly qualified and agreeable. I'm sure he'll meet all of your needs. - I doubt that. Excuse me. The restaurant also has a bar. Let's have a drink there later. Then the two of us could discuss the details on our own. I'm very happy to come to your office on Monday. Other men would put their hand between your legs under the table. I'm not like that. All I'm saying is that I would really like to do it. Otto Wagner hospital. Ward 22. Hello? Hello? Morning. Lola? I thought you were taking the day off. - Not at this stage. Can I tell you something? You do a great job here. Everybody knows that. Why don't you take a day off and get some sleep? Don't you want to see your family? Or meet your friends? No. Okay. See you on Monday then. I want to cook for you. Well, the cooker might still be in its packaging. Nice place. You like being in hotels. I feel more at home there. So do you. Come here. Are you running away? No. I... You're running away from your sister, right? I've come a long way. All by myself. Should I feel guilty about that? - That's not what I meant. It's just... Family is important to me. Does Sebastian have anything to do with Browning? What makes you think of that now? Maybe it's silly, but I heard him talking on the phone in English. He's not working to full capacity. So I gave him some extra tasks. Maybe he'll be an AP soon, too. I've been with the company two years longer than him. It has nothing to do with you. What are you doing? Sorry. This is none of your business. - I'm just trying to understand. Letters written by a lunatic don't reveal anything about me. Did your mother have the same condition? - She was never in a psychiatric hospital. I know too little about this to speculate about the cause, but it might be important to know if it runs in the family. Your father... - We don't have the same father. My mother was never married, she never worked, she did nothing but inherit. Have you got enough information now? - Lola, I'm sorry. All I want is... Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Lola, I didn't mean to... Go away! Come in. - Thanks. Your sister's condition has stabilised. Take a seat. We believe that Cornelia's suicide attempt was a cry for help. But we had to keep her here to prevent further suicide attempts. She'd recover much better if she could go home soon. So I'm considering releasing her in the next few days. Already? She needs a familiar environment, a daily routine. She'll be brought here for therapy three times a week, at home the psycho-social support will take care of her. They'll check she's taking her medication, that she has enough to eat. Trust me: she'll be looked after every single day. I'd have to let them in and I don't want to. They know nothing and nick my stuff. And talk to me as if I were a dog. And they're in bed with Mrs Rasic. Who is Mrs Rasic? The Yugoslav woman from the second floor. The one with the bulgy eyes. Don't you remember? She hospitalised me. She won't let it go. So no. Maybe I can talk to Mrs Rasic. - You don't know her language. I'm sure she speaks German. I've got only one chance to get out of here. What do you mean? If I moved in with you, they'd leave me alone and then... Mrs Rasic wouldn't know the address and we wouldn't tell psycho-social support. It's not that simple. I'm not going back to my flat. It's not safe. And I think I pooed on the floor once, because I was too weak to make it to the toilet. I understand that you don't want to go back. We'll find another flat for you. Smaller, more manageable, more light. I'll take care of that. Enjoy your meal. - You too. All I want is to live with you. Please. I'll sell the old flat and we'll buy a new one. I know a very good real estate agent. But it'll take a couple of weeks. But you have to take me with you today. The doctor said it's okay. It's all happening a bit too fast. You know... I don't like it when you talk to me like that. I'm 40. You're a little girl to me. A year has 52 weeks. I spend maybe two weeks here. And the rest? What do you think? I can clean my own arse. I can make coffee. I can go grocery shopping. Sometimes not. Then I eat frozen food. I've got everything in the freezer. Peas, spinach, vegetable stew... No carbs. You shouldn't eat any carbs. Goodbye. Goodbye. What do you want from me? What I want from you? What? What are you talking about? I don't want anything. I'm responsible for you, Conny. What were you thinking? Can you stop being so full of yourself for once? Full of myself? You just said you needed me. I didn't. - You did. You did! - No! You're so childish. I'm your legal guardian. That's just a phrase. - No, it's a fact. Just because you've got a credit card and fly around doesn't make you better. Birgit. - Hi, Lola. It's Sunday, Birgit. Get a life. It's Monday today. Lola? Are you there? - Yes, sure. I'm calling because of Elise's memo. I'll read it right away. - I just wanted... I wanted to hear it from you. What's wrong? - Nothing. Why? Elise wrote that you wouldn't be here for the presentation. I'll be there on time. - I thought you weren't coming. I worked 1,700 hours on this fucking project! So of course I'll be there! Are you serious? We have to separate our private issues from the job. It was a stupid fight. But I am indispensable for this project. The business case? - The one you signed. The client pays a lot of money to get precise analyses from us. You put me in an awkward situation. Bacher asked me about you in front of the whole team. Now everyone's talking. - Saying what exactly? That you're overworked, exhausted. Maybe a burn-out. A burn-out? That doesn't exist. It's just a stupid fad and you know it. Having a burn-out in our field is like having leprosy. Everyone makes mistakes. Not you. Go and tell Elise yourself that you screwed me over. Or I'll do it. You're paranoid. I was trying to help... - You gave me the wrong figures. You see? That's exactly your problem. Trust. We're better off as lone wolves. That's the difference between a good consultant and a bad one. I put all my energy into the project and you just pursue your own interests. Lola, you don't get it. Here. This is the difference. You'll always be Elise's overpaid tag-along. What's going on? I took Birgit off the project. Birgit! Birgit! - Leave me alone! I had to do it so you can stay. I'm responsible for your performances. I also have bosses to answer to. You're an A. Birgit is a C. Sorry. - Birgit is great. I need her. There are other associates. Take Sebastian. He's... It's all that prick's fault. He gave me the wrong figures to sign. Is it so hard for you to accept that I'm your boss? Yes. There are various strategies, of course. Diversification is just as good a strategy as concentrating on one successful product. Considering Zenzius' current situation, we'd say: less is more. A lot is going on in retail trade. Producers of down-market appliances selling their products via indirect marketing or the Internet are mushrooming. Even Amazon is offering kitchen and bathroom scales at prices that undercut the production costs at Zenzius. So our production costs are too high? - No, that would be a simplification. Zenzius stands for high-quality measuring devices. Your key account customers appreciate and rely on this quality. A reduction of the product range also makes sense when we look at the structure of the departments. Could you elaborate? - An unbalanced deployment of the workforce. For example, we have too many people working on marketing the low-market products, considering the negative turnover there. While we need more people in key account marketing. In other words: it makes no sense to have ten people working on a small flowerbed, while their colleagues are working hard on a much bigger and more fruitful field. Allow us to dig deeper into this. Jürgen. Hold on. I've got a question for Mrs Wegenstein. During your whole time here, one of your concerns was to save as many jobs as possible. How successful were you in this regard? I'm pleased that you've taken note of our efforts. In fact, we will succeed in keeping almost 85% of the staff. The encyclopaedia on legs. If you didn't look like you do, you'd be considered a nerd. I'm glad you're happy with my team. To be honest, I forgot all of the others right away. The implementation has been approved. We'll get in touch regarding the assignment. Glad to hear that. - Me too. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. What's wrong with you? - Everything's fine. It doesn't make a difference if you're in Bahrain or in Birmingham. And he sleeps with his eyes wide open. This guy deals with millions of euros and can't concentrate for 15 minutes. No, he just plays a symbolic role. That Christiansen guy makes the decisions. Cheers. - Here's to us. I like it here. It's so laidback here. With the port and everything. - Where's your next stop? Where's your next stop? We'll know that in a couple of days. I can't just say we're going to Sydney in front of the others. But we are going to Sydney. For sure. Really? - Of course. You were so great today. Can you spare 50 cents? Yes, hold on. Don't you want it? Here. Take this. Come. Good morning, handsome. - Morning. Why are you standing at the window? - I'm watching the news. Have you got any Aspirin? - In my bag. I'll get dressed in a minute. - No rush. You're flying home. I don't need you here for the rest. I'll stay for two days until Jürgen's got the ball rolling. Do you take all of these? Yes. So it's not a cliché that people like us take this stuff. Everyone has a down at some point. You just have to notice it in time. Shall I order coffee for you? Now let's exercise our wrists. Let's rotate them a bit. Great. You're doing fine. Rotate your wrists and make sure you're standing straight. I know it's not easy on these balance discs. Great. And now let's exercise our hands. Lift both of your hands high above your head. Good. Now we can feel it in our shoulders. Now rotate your arms. Are you okay? Don't hit the person next to you. And don't forget: keep your back straight. Try to tense your hips. Perfect. And try to stretch upwards. How high can you get? Perfect. Australia? It wasn't my choice. But it's a large project. It'll last a couple of years. Back then, they took you away while I was here. They brought you to the foster family. The first one. I was on ward eight. And you were already big back then. And you... You had loads of jeans that were too short for you in your brown leather suitcase. Well, it wasn't real leather. And then... Then I didn't see you for one year, eleven months and nine days. Where were you? In Leobersdorf. That'd be a better time to sell. - Yes, it might increase in value, but I don't have the patience. Please send over an agent. I just want the flat sold as soon as possible. Okay, I'll arrange everything. We've been working successfully with... I'll leave it all to you. I'll send you all the documents and the keys with a messenger. As for the condition of the flat... It's not rundown. It just needs some renovation. I see. - But the neighbourhood is fancy. But I recommend to renovate before you sell. - Sure... Yes, I know. But I... Just sell it for me. - Of course. As you wish. I also need someone to clear out the flat. I mean, there's old furniture and garbage to be cleared, before potential buyers come to see the flat. Sure. Mr Maitz will take care of everything. We'll make an appointment as soon as we have all the documents. Okay. I'll hear from you then. Bye. Of course. Bye. I understand your concern, doctor, but trust me, I'll do everything I can to stabilise Conny's living situation. You can't replace her doctors and nurses. But she'll come to every therapy session. She doesn't want any strangers in her house. She's scared. And I respect that. It's nice that you want to be part of Cornelia's life again. I think you underestimate how hard the most simple daily tasks are for her. It's a huge responsibility... It won't be easy. I've got to go, doctor. Linke Wienzeile, 36. - 36? Okay. Beautiful. The balcony is small. It runs all the way round there. Would you like a tea? - Yes, please. But no sugar. Just sweetener. Only Stevia. The other sweetener gives you brain tumours. All right. I'll write it on the list. At the hospital, I'm always afraid of my roommates. Scared they might press a pillow on my face while I'm sleeping, or steal my stuff. But I don't worry about that with you. I'll visit you the first weekend of every month. That's a fixed date. As a child, you always said "horange". Really? Instead of "orange". "I want a horange." Sounds like "horror orange". - You thought it was French. Horange. We'll write a list of all the things you need later. It'll be delivered twice a week then. It's really convenient. They leave it outside the door. Why aren't there any pictures? I can't make up my mind. There's also a very nice lady who I met at the pet hotel. Her name is Sarah. She'd like to meet you. She's not a social worker. She's just a friend. And... She'll come by now and then, and can take you to therapy, whenever you don't feel like taking a taxi. How tall is she? As tall as I am. Short. Yes. Short. Hi, there. Good cat. Good. Conny... Everything's fine. This special edition is a great gift for him. You won't regret it. A timeless classic with extras. Limited edition. Like a woman for life. Selikovsky. Hi, it's me. Where's Elise? - Lola? What is it? - I'm in Rostock and Elise is gone. She's in Munich. Does she have a meeting with the partners? - I think she's packing her things. I have a meeting here, starting in two minutes. With Browning? Yes. I'm supposed to be doing that. - Well, Elise sent me here. Is this going to be awkward? Lola? Hi. Why are you still here? They didn't know right away where to send me next. And then... I binge-watched Sky TV and ate club sandwiches. And where are you going now? Hildesheim. On the drawer to your left. The rest is for you. Have you lost your mind? I thought you were the Foodora guy. You sent Sebastian to Sydney. Why so serious? You spent eight months promising me that. Well... I... I'm not in charge of human resources. You promote him to the status of expert and give him the largest project. Yes. It's a fucking huge project. Did you think you wouldn't need an expert? They're making you Associate Principal. It's official as of tomorrow. So let that fucker move up. From now on, he's working under you. I did it. Yes. And what does it feel like? What's going on here? Hey! Hey, what about my money? I rang three times, but she didn't open up. So I let myself in with my key. I went to the balcony and... Mrs Wegenstein. Mrs Wegenstein, let's go inside. Come on, Mrs Wegenstein. Mrs Wegenstein, come with me. My colleague is coming. She'll take you... She'll be here any minute. She'll take you to the doctor and he'll examine you. You're in shock. Come with us. Mrs Wegenstein. Mrs Wegenstein. Can't she move? - No, there are no injuries to indicate that. Mrs Wegenstein, the psychologist is here. Hello, Mrs Wegenstein. My name is Wallner. I'm a psychiatrist and a therapist. Hello. - Hello. You know why you're here and what has happened? My... My sister committed suicide. Right. And you had a nervous breakdown, which is quite normal in your situation. And I... I had surgery on my left hand because I broke it so badly. The scars probably won't go away. So I overreacted a bit. Have you got the charger for me yet? - No, not yet. Mrs Wegenstein, why don't you tell me how you feel? No, thanks. I just want to get out of here as soon as possible. You shouldn't overtax yourself now. Your sister's suicide is a traumatic incident. Is there anyone in your family who can support you? Parents, relatives, husband, life partner, boyfriend? I'm an orphan, single and have no children. Mrs Wegenstein, what's "a 48"? I've been told you talk about it in your sleep. In my job it's an insider expression for a 48-hour-shift, without sleeping. But it... We don't do it that often. Okay. I'd like to prescribe you a light anti-depressant. I'm not depressive. Whatever you say. Okay. Good luck. Thanks. - Goodbye. Goodbye. "I look down at my body, and I cannot see myself. I can move, and I cannot walk properly. What has become of me since you've known me? As of yesterday, I'm only distantly related to myself. While you were looking at me, everything was easy to see. There's nothing more to explain. There's nothing more to understand." Subtitles: Mandana Taban Taban translating films GmbH, 2018
