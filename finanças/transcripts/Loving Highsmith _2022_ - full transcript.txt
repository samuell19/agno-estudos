(mellow music) (clacking of typewriter keys) (hissing, sizzling) Ideas come to me like birds, that I see in the corner of my eye, and I may try, or may not, to get a closer fix on those birds. (clacking of keys) (mellow music) The music of the merry-go-round sounded tired and very distant. (carnival music) If he had Miriam here in the boat with him, he would hold her head under the water with pleasure. (chatter, laughter) (woman screaming) The lights on the water silhouetted her head and shoulders. Never had he been so close. She faced him, Is your name Miriam? But he knew, she could barely see him. His hands captured her throat, but he had her too tight for a scream. (mellow dramatic music) Good stories are made from the writers' emotions alone. Even if a suspense book is entirely calculated, there will be scenes which the writer has very likely known himself. (bird cawing) (mellow music) Like many other filmmakers, I was immediately drawn to Patricia Highsmith's writing. Almost all of her books were made into films. (soft chuffing) But when I started reading her unpublished diaries, I fell in love with Patricia Highsmith herself. (meowing) Her very first diary entry is rather mysterious: (pencil scratching) And here is my diary, containing the body - the painfullest feeling is that of your own feebleness. (mellow music) (bright mellow music) (waves crashing) (insects chirring) She had a strangeness. She picked strange ideas, that I would never be able to think of. (leaves rustling, birds chirping) We met in the Village, in New York. She found out I was a writer and that interested her. She was not a forward person at all. She didn't assume that she was entitled to anything and that was nice, in a way. Because certainly, she was very famous when I met her. (sweeping dramatic music) Strangers on a Train, your first book, Ms. Highsmith, it was bought by a celebrated film director? Yes, Hitchcock took an interest in it. (dramatic music) Ever since I was 16 or 17, I get, what is sometimes called "creepy ideas. " Wanna hear one of my ideas for a perfect murder? I may be old-fashioned, but I thought, murder was against the law? (dramatic music) Your initial idea was these two men exchanging murders? Yes, that was the very initial idea, to be sure. These things just pop into one's head, in my opinion. I can never say why or when. (soft dramatic music) Highsmith's writing is so cinematic, that the master of suspense finds the perfect, somber universe for his film in it. But from then on, she struggles with the label of being a crime writer. (dramatic music) I am always categorized in mystery and suspense, when I never wrote a mystery in my life. I just write a story and sometimes it has violence in it, sometimes it has a murder and therefore, it's called crime. (dramatic music) She was better looking than I thought she would be. That's only because I'm a writer and usually when we meet, I meet other writers, they're all sort of seedy, like I am. And. . She was different. (car horns honking) We met in L's. It was called L's for lesbian, I guess. New York was loaded with gay bars. It was the '50s. I was very interested in gay places. And I would ask cab drivers. . And I remember a cab driver said: "I know, a place over in blabla. " And he took me there. And the owner, a woman, said: "You never come here again, ever" And I said: "Why? It's for me, isn't it?" She said: "It's for people with discretion. And you just ruined it. You've given a cab driver the name of this place. " (solemn music) Gay bars are a dark door somewhere in Manhattan, where people wanting to go to a certain bar, get off the subway a station before or after the convenient one, lest they be suspected of being homosexual. This is William Street. (solemn music) Pat was more dedicated than any writer I'd ever met. I was curious to write a book about a writer like her. I wrote a book about her later on. A handsome, dark haired woman in a trench coat, drinking gin, stood at the bar. In the outside world, she was better known as Patricia Highsmith, author of "Strangers on a Train. " But in L's, there was the buzz that she was Claire Morgan. Pat was revered for her pseudonymous novel, Carol. It stood on every lesbian bookshelf and was for many years, the only lesbian novel with a happy ending. (mellow music) Do you think it was important for Pat to write a gay book? Sure. Sure. I mean, she was gay and. . And if she was a writer, that's what she wanted to do. Write about that life. People were saying: "Write the same thing as Strangers. Write it again. Write something like that. " And I wasn't, at that moment, inspired to do so. (soft music) I had a job in a very busy department store in New York. I was selling dolls. It was at Christmas rush hour. And a woman came in in a fur coat, who was rather striking. (dramatic music) The woman seemed to give off light. I felt odd and swimmy in the head, near to fainting. . Their eyes met at the same instant. (siren wailing) (alarm ringing) When she stood up, the woman was looking at her with the calm grey eyes that Therese could neither quite face nor look away from. Where did you learn so much about train sets? Therese noticed the woman's perfume, for the first time and wished with all her power to wish anything, that the woman would simply continue her last words and say: "Why can't we see each other again?" (soft music) I like the hat. (indistinct PA announcement) That night, I wrote out the whole story in my notebook. (scratching) Highsmith never meets the woman again. She feverishly writes down the plot of the story in her notebook. At the end, she adds notes of her own experiences, from her private diaries. Madly in love with my Carol. I want to spend all my time, all my evenings with her. (birds chirping) Oh God, how this story emerges from my own bones. It flowed from my pen as from nowhere. Beginning, middle and end. (mellow music) Although writing Carol is greatly liberating, Highsmith has doubts about publishing the book at all. Ultimately, she releases it under a pen name. Anybody didn't use their own name on a gay book. It wasn't smart. I used Ann Aldrich, Vin Packer and any name, but not my own name ever. It was my family's name. (mellow music) Your second book, I think, you published under a nom de plume. - Yeah. - Why was that? No particular reason. Was it accepted by the publisher you sent it to? It certainly was not. It was rejected by New York publishers. And they said: "No one can bring off this ending. " A lesbian book had to have an unhappy ending. Somebody who was living with a straight family and fell in love with a woman. And depending on your publisher, you were either very sorry or you had a nice time. But it didn't last. It couldn't last and you realized it. Why did Pat never publish a "girls' book" again? The family. Certainly family, certainly mother. And. . Those two things were big enough to stop anybody. (cheering) (mellow country music) (insects chirring) Look, toughie Pat. I think she's got a cigar in her mouth. But that's so cute. She looked like a little boy there. This. . is granddaddy and Pat. Her brother. Pat always called him brother. She never referred to him as her cousin. Dan and Pat grew up together. (insects chirring) (mellow music) Dan was a rodeo announcer. Our family has just been a ranching, rodeo, probably a basic Texas family. (mellow music) We spent every weekend, growing up, going to rodeos. (crowd cheering) So, who was more famous here? Her "brother" Dan or Pat? In Texas? - Dan. - Oh yeah, granddaddy. Definitely my granddad. (insects chirring) Your childhood was a little unsettled, wasn't it? Yes. My mother decided to get a divorce before I was born. Pat's mother Mary divorced nine days before Pat was born. And then married Stanley Highsmith. I don't know if it was Mary that decided to move to New York, if her next husband decided that for them, but Pat's mother moved to New York and left Pat with, who I will refer to as "Grandma. " (children chattering) My memories are very pleasant, of the first six years of my life. My grandmother had, what we call a backyard and a big lawn. Texas is definitely southern. So, I have a sense of being a Southerner rather than a Northerner. (insects chirring) (mellow music) My character was essentially made before I was 6. (applause) (mellow music) And 6 is exactly the age when Patricia's mother takes her to New York. She starts living with a stepfather she didn't know, and a mother, whom she only knew as a visitor to Texas. (mellow music) (gulls cawing) According to my mother, she took turpentine to induce abortion and failed. According to my mother (still another story of hers), my father suggested that she have an abortion. I have asked her which story is true. But my mother does not like direct, simple questions and has not answered to date. I realize that both stories could be true, if the turpentine bit comes first. (crowd chatter) (mellow music) I would bet anything, that Mary was appalled at having a child. The first person you look to, to love you unconditionally is your mother. And I don't know that Mary had that to give. She dedicated two books to her mother. She had a mother love. And. . It was never returned. Her mother was a bitch. (gulls cawing) Highsmith holds on to the unattainable love of her mother and states in her notebook: I am married to my mother, I shall never wed another. (gulls cawing) (solemn music) (children chattering, playing) I entered New York public school, I had just come from Texas and I was six years old. When my mother came to fetch me from school the first day, I was walking hand in hand with a little black boy. (solemn music) My grandmother was shocked when she heard of black children in my school, and she asked my parents to put me in some other school. I had not been to school before. Not in the South. So, I knew nothing of segregation. (solemn music) (chatter) (siren wailing) (indistinct radio chatter) Today I saw two little girls, sitting on the threshold of a door. The older was touching the other in some way, so when they saw me pass, they pulled their dresses over their knees. I knew that something had occurred, that they would remember possibly all their lives. I know all this, because the same thing has happened to me. (hum of motor) (waves crashing) When did you realize that you fall in love with women? In boarding school. But I think I always knew. I was always interested in women. (gulls cawing) When I was 14, my mother said to me: "Why don't you straighten up and fly right? Are you a les? You are beginning to make noises like one. " At 16, when rather notably, I was uninterested in young men, my mother found a boyfriend for me and he and I used to go dining and dancing. It was not pleasant for me to have to kiss him goodnight. "It's like falling into a bucket of oysters" I think she wished she wasn't that way because of her mother. She really had a thing about her. But. . it was not returned, except in the snidest, meanest way possible. "Well, if you like me so much, why don't you dress like a woman? What are you wearing pants for?" You know, that kind of thing. Pat's mother wants her to marry a friend she met while writing Strangers on a Train. I attempted this sexual intercourse many times. I was going to the analyst at this time. I kept trying my very best to get into a condition to be married. To be plain: Sexual intercourse for me, is like steel wool in the face. She went to a doctor and tried to change her ways. She tried. She did try. But I don't know anybody who didn't. Including me. We all tried. But. . No luck. (dark music) (solemn music) (indistinct announcement) It is a cloud of guilt-feelings in my mother that causes almost all these difficulties. If my mother could lift them from her shoulders, then she and I would have no problems. (solemn music) (applause) (indistinct announcement) Do you feel like I do, that people who write have a wound somewhere, a blessure? Most of the human race has a blessure. There's always some trauma in childhood. But not everybody chooses to be a writer. (whistle blowing) (indistinct conversation) (bright music) Highsmith never tells her mother she wrote 'Carol' Before the novel sees the light of day, she escapes on her first trip to Europe. She travels extensively between the continents all her life. (bright music) I am determined to make a good thing of every catastrophe of my life. (bright music) (indistinct singing) (donkey braying) (bright music) There will come a day When I shall voyage All around the earth, When I shall know The names and faces Of men and women and children I shall know the turns In many roads, And I shall have friends beyond number And I shall still be lonely As I am now And I shall still desire then To know more faces and names and cities I am the forever-seeking. (water lapping) (speaking in French) My love of ships never grows old. Highsmith writes whole diaries in French, German and Spanish. She lists the destinations she travels to on the front page of her notebooks. (pencil scratching) People, Places, Things are her recurring categories. Under "Keime", the German word for "germs", she notes the seeds of ideas that infect her with a new story. (wind blowing) I am very happy working on my new book. I have never felt so sure. The sentences of this book go down on the paper like nails. It is a wonderful feeling. (mellow music) Highsmith lives a double identity from the beginning. In her notebooks, she calls her thoughts about homosexuality: "Notes on an ever-present subject" (mellow music) Homosexuals prefer one another's company because they have all been through the same hell, and those who meet have survived. (mellow music) (crowd chatter) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow music) A sexual love can become a religion, and serve as well. (mellow music) If my experience should be shut off, sexually, emotionally, I feel l should have enough. I have stretched an hour into eternity. (hum of airplane overhead) Millie Alford, who started American Airlines. Yeah, the flight attendant school? Was it Aunt Millie who started the flight attendant school? Did you know that Pat had an affair with her? Shut up! What did she say? Pat had an affair with Millie. - Shut up. - Wait a minute! This just in. How did that come out? I am trying to think of how they're related. I think it was just a short thing. I think all of her affairs were pretty short. They were related. Yeah, but. . Pretty distant, isn't it? Let me get this put in my mind here. I'm going to be thinking on that for a little while. If you find out anything, in any of this, that says anything about any of us. - Burn it! - You burn it. (cheering, applause) (bright music) (indistinct announcement) (applause) Was Pat a typical Texan woman? - No. - No. Not in any shape or form. My grandmother slept in a push-up bra and a wig. The entire time that she. . and my granddad were married. And granddaddy liked it that way. Granddaddy just thought, she looked like a million bucks. You know, for the Coates men, they've been and done a lot, morally or not, but a woman was supposed to act like a woman. A lady was supposed to act like a lady. And you didn't veer off of that. (bright music) (chatter) (hooves clopping) Tabea has bowled me over, knocked me mentally on the floor! To laugh and have a beer with her, that seems all I want in life just now. (rustling) (jaunty piano music) Generalizing, women are not important characters in your books. It's hard for me to. . see women as a whole, standing on their own feet. I still see them as, sort of in relationship to a man, which is very curious, because my mother had her own career since the age of 20. So, I had, in my childhood the image of a rather strong, independent woman. And yet, I don't see them that way. (chatter) Why do you think Pat always wrote books with male protagonists? Because they sell best. Women like to read about men and men like to read about men. (bird cawing) Signore Ripley? That's me. Of course, welcome back. Thank you. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) There isn't any constant personality for the writer. I like him. Marge. The face with which he meets his old friends or strangers. He is always part of his characters. No, I like him. Marge. Ripley. Well, he's different. I depicted him as a person who doesn't feel guilt in the usual way. It's as if he's quite. . It just doesn't bother him, as it should. Or as it does in most people. May I be the only one to say I really fell in love the day I first set eyes on you? May I? What are you doing? I was just amusing myself. Sorry. I wish you'd get out of my clothes. (dramatic music) Ripley's sex life is very ambiguous. He's rather shy and a little bit homosexual, I would say. (dramatic music) (speaking in Italian) What I wonder is: You don't admire Ripley, do you? No, I certainly don't. But I think, well, I hope Ripley is amusing. Even in America, Ripley is rather popular. But of course, he is a killer. Yes, but lately, he kills only when. . when he thinks it's right. They say, most murders take place within the family. I admit, his first murder was a very cruel one. (dramatic music) The funny thing is, I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. Boring. I've been absolutely honest with you about my feelings. Who are you? Some third class mooch? Who are you to tell me anything? - You give me the creeps. - You shut up! You can't move without your Dickie, Dickie. Like a little girl! Shut up! (grunting) Stop! Stop! (panting) I don't think that murder is my theme. If anybody wants to ask me, I would say guilt. The absence or the presence of guilt. Or you could also say, the overwhelming desire to confess, to put your foot in your own trap. "Oh, my god, what have I done?" This can be a pain in the neck. Whereas Ripley, he's very gay about what he's done. He doesn't give a damn and gets away with it. Very cool. So far, but what are you going to do with him? He'll always get away with it. Oh, he will? (hum of traffic) (mellow music) I wanted to be out of New York. I didn't think she would take to that, but she did. She had a big black cat. And I had four cats. (mellow music) So, the seven of us were driving out to Pennsylvania. The cats were in boxes. Crying away. (imitates yowling cat) My girl, my woman, my wife in the country. Beating my eggs and arranging my bed, Arranging my hair just as she likes it. Wood fires and twigs, Apples and figs, No telephone, no guests, only our ego-system of work, love making, and who will cook today? (mellow music) She was easy to love, let's put it that way. Even though it was a. . a sin. . to have a female lover. It was a good sin. (insects chirring) Two women living together, everybody would understand that they'd combine their salaries, because women didn't make much. Nobody ever thought that they were doing it for sex. (birdsong, hammering in distance) Some kids used to come over to the house and talk. They were neighbors' kids. They came to our back door and we were making Sunday dinner and we were kissing. Boy, did they run. They ran home so fast and they never came back. In a small town that carries a lot of weight for gossip. There's a lot of people that say: "What you say? Say it again! You saw them kissing?" (insects chirring) Pat collected these diaries. And there was one missing and she thought I had it. She was tipsy enough to tell me she had read my diaries, causing me to stop keeping one, until now, I suppose. I might have. I might have, because, you know, I'm not above that. But there was not an opportunity much. She was also like a cat. She walked and you didn't hear it. The breach of trust prompts Highsmith to write her more private thoughts in her notebooks from this moment on. All her life, she is worried that somebody could read her diaries. She places warnings and curses on their first pages. (pencil scratching) The first thing in the morning, Pat was working. She always had orange juice in the morning. And one morning, I found it on the table. I lifted it up to take it in to her and she said: "Ah! What have you got there?" And I said: "Your drink. " And she said: "Taste it. " And it was loaded with gin. So, all these mornings that she was down there working and doing things, she was filling up on gin. I didn't think somebody that wrote so well, could put themselves in such a vulnerable position. (insects chirring) (soft music) After a most pleasant and successful dinner, MJ ran up the stairs saying: "You're drunk. I don't want another fight, Pat. " We slept in separate rooms. (soft music) These days swim all one into the other. She's afraid of my drinking, I'm terrified of her temper. I said: "This is impossible, we can't live together. " At the end, we had the usual breakup. . And then she moved out. (soft music) Did she have high expectations for love? I think we all do. When we fall in love, we have high expectations. That's what it's about. (clacking of typewriter keys) We must think of ourselves as a fertile land on which to draw. And if we do not, we grow rotten, like an unmilked cow. And if we leave something unexploited it dies within us wasted. (soft music) If you write, it is a form of analyzing experience. But one's personal experience is rather limited. Even if you have a couple of divorces or something. It's limited! But if you use your imagination, it's really unlimited! (soft music) Highsmith tries to write another "girls' book," as she calls her lesbian novels, in which she weaves her personal love biography from her diaries. (pencil scratching) The object of this book is to depict the mature woman, who cannot keep herself from practicing homosexuality. It is the story of her own greenness, her selfishness, her idealism, her maturity - (distant crowd noise) Highsmith doesn't finish the manuscript and will never publish any other "girls' book" again. (solemn music) After a visit to Texas, she is afraid of being exposed as the author of "Carol. " Her mother has told the family preacher about the secret book. She writes a letter to her stepfather: I never presented that book to my mother. She found it, because I lent you and her my flat. Would it not occur to any idiot that if a person writes a book under another name, that person wishes to keep the fact secret from the public? But oh, no. Not my mother. (insects chirring) I often wonder, what my mother thinks is so wrong with me. I have not been in prison, I do not take drugs, I have no broken marriages, no illegitimate children, I earn a good living. I am even in Who's Who, the international, published in London. (rustling) Come on, everybody. I don't remember ever hearing her mother say: "Have you talked to Pat? Have you heard from Pat? Do you know when Pat's coming home?" Those two people, in my life, were never even seen in the same room together. So, putting them together as a mother and daughter and "Why isn't she caring for this one?" That would never have crossed my mind. (insects chirping) Highsmith hires a lawyer. She cuts all legal ties to her mother and gets herself disinherited. I would like to separate myself from my mother, my mother from me, legally speaking, from any obligation whatever. It would certainly be a great relief to me, and I hope to her. (cacophony of nocturnal animals) (bells ringing) It took me years to find one of the most important women in Highsmith's life. By the time I found out who she was, the woman had just passed away. I will keep her secret and call her 'Caroline. ' (solemn music) The color comes and goes in her cheeks. Her brown eyes look at me directly. And brown is absolutely the last color I would think of in attempting to describe her. Cream, pink, even white. . And what is the color of warmth? (solemn music) (mellow music) Her married lover manages to steal away to meet secretly in Paris for a few days. A necklace of verses I will make you. One by one, Strung on a brief time, A thread of time to remember, to remember these few days, to keep these few days, forever. (mellow music) Paris struck us like a light, And dazzled, we groped along the stones of Notre Dame, Seeing with our fingertips. (mellow music) Beauty, perfection, completion. . All achieved and seen. Death is the next territory, one step to the left. (mellow music) Can I kiss you in some doorway? (mellow music) (roar of passing traffic) Back home - I am absolutely sick for her, and I must summon up every bit of courage and determination that I possess, in order to carry on alone. (mellow music) C's letters are. . as if she were making love to me when she wrote them. I am drunk and drugged on them and on writing her. There is no use in making any further effort to live without her. I cannot. And in all my 41 years, I have never said or written this about anyone else before. (mellow music) This means England. This is the first time Highsmith moves to another country for a woman. She buys a cottage in an English village close to her lover. (mellow music) No sleep. Quite wonderful to come to London. C in her dressing gown to open the door! (pencil scratching) (mellow music) As I wrote this evening in my 26th notebook, of which the last city and country I'm in is Caroline. All I could wish, leisure, Caroline, cats, the sea. I am divinely happy with her. As if I lived in a dream world, and yet it is real. (mellow music) (footsteps) (door closes) Harge, what's wrong? Nothing. Does there need to be a problem for me to visit my wife? Two letters from C. Her difficulties with leading a "double life" on the grounds that she was physically sick: I know she wants to tell her husband. How do you know my wife? Harge, please. Paris should be kept quiet no matter what. I worry about her strong sense of convention. I do not know if C can suddenly or even slowly take the complete alteration a life with me must bring. We could be endlessly discreet, but without a husband, could she be happy and face the world? The affair with the married woman. One may think for a while, that one is satisfied with the small amount of time together. But one is not satisfied with taking second place emotionally. I miss C so terribly, I want her in my days, my bed, my life. C would prolong forever her sadistic relationship with me. It is not a relationship. . It has no flow, no joy. But she would not break it off, ever. But I did. The very worst time of my entire life. (solemn dramatic music) In Paris, when I began to take pleasure in existence, for existence's sake, it was the beginning of the end for me. (dramatic music) Getting ready to sell the house in England. It is a negative thing, perhaps like an abortion. (hum of engine) (mellow music) I may not be capable of love. I want something romantic, perhaps not definite. I repeat the pattern of mother's semi-rejection of me. (mellow music) The taste of death is sometimes in my mouth, these solitary evenings. Will I in five years, two years, one, Smash my teeth again And curse what I hesitate to call my fate, my pattern? (mellow music) Mornings are frantic like all morning, Exhausted by afternoon, I have completed my chores, And am faced with myself and my not-self again. Then I work. I work like a worm in the earth, I work like a termite fashioning a tunnel, a bridge. I work for a future I can no longer see. (keys clacking) (clicking) Decision of today, not to ever (share a house) with anyone again. (clacking of typewriter keys) (cat yowling) (clacking of typewriter keys) (birds chirping) (dog barking) (rustling, creaking) (mewing) Every poet knows that the best images come when the mind does not think too intently, when it is occupied with doing something else, something mechanical. Inspiration and ideas come from the subconscious but the subconscious must be given free reign. (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) That's very important for you to work, living alone. Oh, yes. And why? Because of the silence and because of not having to talk. The profound indignity of being interviewed. Funny the way it eats you slowly. I feel like a patient on a table with some kind of a disease. The doctor says: "Take off all your clothes. " It becomes very disturbing. Ok, I ask this stupid question: Are you happy? Yes. Mainly. Yes. Why not? (pencil scratching) Writing, of course, is a substitute for the life I cannot live, am unable to live. (whine of airplane engine) (chatter) By now, so many of Highsmith's books have been made into films that she is invited to chair the jury of the Berlin Film Festival. (applause) (rush of water) I fell in love not with flesh and blood, But with a picture: the sailor cap, The crazy moustache, the little bird perched on the girl-sailor's right shoulder, And the puzzled and somewhat serious eyes. If I would touch you, maybe you would shatter Or dissolve, like a dream one tries too hard to remember. (wind blowing) (clattering) (mellow music) All of Highsmith's experiences with Tabea flow into her 4th Ripley novel "The Boy Who Followed Ripley. " Like Tabea and Pat, Ripley and the teenage boy in the book visit "Peacock Island. " (mellow music) If I were only a good poet, Able to distill all this into a clear and beautiful little sphere, Like a gem one could see through, polished, Something to keep, small in my pocket, Something to look at That wouldn't hurt. (mellow music) (birds chirping) (peacock calling) (hum of passing traffic) (soft music) Only a dream Only a dream Oh, glory beyond the dark stream How peaceful the slumber, how happy the waking For death is only a dream Oh, Mother, the dark, the light came at last It filled me with peaceful gleam It's true, they say, it's cloud overcast For death is only a dream (soft music) (music fades) (buzz of airplane overhead) No memory of pleasure and pain amidst years of a love that was great, but which ended sadly. (cat yowling) For the first time in her life, Highsmith is unable to write. After having started the new Ripley novel, inspired by Tabea, she falters after 50 pages. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (groans) (dramatic music) It's December 6th. 1976. There's nothing to fear but fear itself. (dramatic music) I know less and less about. . who I am or who anybody else is. "The difference between dream and reality: that's the real hell. " Would you agree? Yes, I certainly would and I wrote that sentence years ago, before I ever thought of writing this book. Because I. . I feel it myself. It's a disappointment in what one wishes. But in a way it's normal, I think. I mean, it doesn't necessarily mean that one becomes insane. Because I think, almost everybody has hopes about either their work or about their marriage or something that doesn't quite come true. (water trickling) (birds chirping) (water pouring) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (water lapping) (solemn music) I imagine tomorrow your letter will say: "Well Pat, nice to have known you for a little bit of time, but we had better stop seeing each other. " But you must not feel that I shall feel sad, because of this. It is not your fault, and you must not think about it. (solemn music) (engine starts) (engine rumbles) (solemn music) (solemn music) (roar of car engine) Life in Switzerland. It seems to me that people could be much influenced by the lack of sunlight. However, I happen to like calmness, because I am nervous inside. (solemn music) I would feel that I got myself into a trap and an unhappy one, in those moments I remember Montcourt and its sunlight which I shall never forget. (bells ringing in the distance) Only weeks after Highsmith sells her house in France, she wants to buy it back, but she doesn't succeed. So, she stays and builds herself a new house. (crow cawing) It must be strange to enter a house and begin living there and fix it up, knowing it is the last home you will ever live in. I carry old memories around like a heavy suitcase. I wish I'd never met this one and that, But I have, and I don't forget. (pencil scratching) Spent two hours of reading old diaries of mine. My life is a chronicle of unbelievable mistakes. Things I should have done and vice versa. By now, Highsmith makes fewer and fewer entries in her diaries. And they start to contain rants and prejudice against Jews, Arabs and Blacks. As if she were returning to the racism of her beloved grandmother in Texas. I live my life backwards My envy turned to hatred And the hatred to contempt. Now you, who knew a freedom I never did, wonder at my bitterness, Resentment, you say, I am full of. Yet resentment was my second emotion, One I knew well before I knew its name. (dramatic music) I know less and less about. . who I am or who anybody else is. (dramatic music) (wind rustling leaves) Writing is the only way to feel respectable, Highsmith once said. Already seriously ill with leukemia, she is making plans for another Ripley novel. (leaves rustling) The months had been somewhat angst-filled. The mental fear needs a thousand words to describe. It is as though death is right there, suddenly, and yet one feels no pain, one is talking in a calm voice to friends and doctors. The last chapter of her famous love story has remained open. Nearly 40 years after its first appearance, Highsmith decides to reveal her authorship and republish Carol under her own name. A book like Carol, why it's so interesting now to people who know your work very well, is not simply that it was a gay novel. It was also a very affirmative gay novel. It had a happy end. Yes. The characters for once didn't commit suicide or fall into the gutter or whatever they. . cut their wrists, was a great one. They at least were going to try to make something of their lives. It doesn't say they will in the end. But at least they try. Now, in retrospect, that's particularly unusual for you. You're not a writer known for your happy endings. It looks for a long time as if the ending is not gonna be happy. And then, quite suddenly it turns and the two women come back together again. Was that at all a conscious choice to make the happy ending? I think so, because. . Yes, it was a conscious. . I wanted that, definitely. (leaves rustling) Highsmith works until the very end on a new gay novel. This time, openly. She dies only weeks before it appears. It ends with her last published words: "The funny thing was, Rickie, in a quiet way, felt happy. " (leaves rustling) (soft music) At dawn, after my death hours before, The sunlight will spread at seven o'clock as usual On these trees which I know. Greenness will burst, dark green shadows yield To the cruel-benign, indifferent sun. Unweeping for me on the morning of my death. The trees will rest in breezeless dawn, Blind and uncaring, The trees that I knew, That I tended. (whistling) (mellow music) (bright music) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) (music fades, ends)
