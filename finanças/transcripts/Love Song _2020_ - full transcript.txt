LOVE SONG He's wonderful, isn't he? I think I have every album Duke Sterling ever made. He was pretty great, all right. I guess we're both here for the same audition. Looks like we're the last two of the day. - Better last than not at all, right? - Have we met before? - I'm... - Shayna Judson? - Yeah. That's me. - Come with me, please. Be with you in a few. - Good luck in there! - Thank you! Shayna Judson, his is Carl Cam-- Carl Campbell. You are Duke Sterling's manager. - Best in the business; ask anybody. - Thanks for coming in. - You can set yourself up over there. - Okay, great. I have my demo for him, if he wants it. So, okay. You know what you're here for. You are looking for backup singers for Duke Sterling. Duke is recording a new album next month. After that, there'll be a promotional tour, which means a stretch along the road. Just so happens my next month's pretty free. We're seeing a number of singers. We only need a couple. - So what do you have for us? - One from the man himself. Keep going. Wait a second. Okay. Okay, bye. - Great. Great. That's great. - That's it? I've got more prepared. I think we're good. Thanks. Did you hear back? Will they do it? - They're ready for you. - How'd it go? Hope you have better luck than I did. You're coming home? - Everything all right? - Yeah. Everything's fine, Dad. - I miss you, is all. - I miss you, too. Timing's good. Fall Music Festival starts next week. - We're expecting record crowds. - You love showing off that ranch. White Star is my pride and joy, you know that. Next to you, of course. Are you sure nothing's wrong? Yes, Dad. Nothing a big dose of home couldn't cure. We can talk when I get home. Just don't worry about me, okay? - I love you. - Love you, too. - Drive safe. - Okay. Bye. He's late. He's Duke Sterling. He can be late if he wants to. Look! It's our first album. I'm sorry: it's his first album. Ron, you do artist relations, right? So can you relate to the idea that I don't really want to do this? I'm still one of your top songwriters, aren't I? Yes, but most of your stuff ends up as album tracks these days. - There's no breakouts. You need a hit. - And you think Duke is the answer? I think having him record one of your songs is good for both of you. You guys wrote a ton of chart-toppers back in the day, remember that. Duke! Come in. You know Grady. This is a surprise. How you doing, Grady? - Duke. - Been a while. Carl. - Shayna?! Oh, my... - Hey! Oh, my gosh! - How'd Nashville let you get away? - I don't even think they know I'm gone. I saw your dad yesterday. He didn't say a word. He didn't know. I called him on my way in. And I thought, as long as I was passing through town, why not take a quick stop and say hello to my best friend? So, what's up? And don't say "nothing" because I can read you like a book and you know it. I had an audition that didn't go so well. The Shayna I know doesn't let one bad audition get her down. Yeah. Not one audition. It's a string of them. Jenny, you know more than anybody that I have been knocking on all the doors. Yes. I'm at the bars, the cafes, birthdays. I sang a dog's wedding last month. And then there was this chance to back up Duke Sterling. Duke Sterling? Is that why you're here? You know that he's headlining the Silverado festival, right? I didn't get it. Okay. So you're not singing there; sing here. - Actually, how about tonight? - I don't know, Jenny. I feel like I need to take a break from music for a while. I need you. This place needs you. Come on! What do you say? That's a yes? - Please? - Okay, fine. But one night, Jenny. Okay. Great! Yes. I'm going to spread the word. Oh, boy. It is so good to have you home, girl. I'm excited to be here. I'll see you tonight. Okay. Yes. Thank you. - You want him to write a song for me? - For you. With you. Whatever. Hey, wasn't my idea. Guys, you're headlining the Silverado Fall Music Festival next week, right? The publicity alone! Introduce it there, build anticipation for the album. Grady can go on ahead, check out the talent, find some inspiration. You guys can get together after and figure it out. You need this as much as he does. Come on, guys. What do you say? - Just like old times? - Won't that be fun? - Hey, Dad! - You made good time. Let me look at you for a second. Now, when's the last time you've had a decent meal, young lady? With all these waitressing jobs lately, I have been eating just fine. Hey, guys! Hey, Earl! - Hey, Shayna. Welcome home. - Thank you. - So, how do you like the new sign? - "Silverado Fall Music Festival"? Isn't that what it always says? Yes. But it's a new font and it really makes it pop. That's your dad's idea. How did I miss it? It is so much better. Okay. C'mon. Give me a ride back up to the house, okay? - What's all this? - Just some stuff I brought back. It looks like more than just "some". Okay. You drive up to the house. - We'll talk about it up there. - Okay. Here for the Music Festival, I take it. More musicians here per square foot than anywhere in the country this week. - You don't say? - I do say. There's some big-name talent. Well, Duke Sterling. He somebody? Duke Sterling? The country music star? Not really into music. It's where I keep my shirts. Thank you. Hey, girl. You miss me? She looks good. Everything around here looks good. The ranch is fine. It's you I worry about. I'm find, Dad. I just need some space to breathe; figure things out. Nobody said the music industry'd be easy. Yeah, nobody said it'd break my heart, either. I've written some great songs. I've sung for anybody who'd listen. No such thing as an overnight success. My entire life isn't exactly "overnight," Dad. So you gonna put me to work? You're not paying me to just around and feel sorry for myself. I'm not paying you anything at all. - Free room and board? - Who said anything about free? Start by taking the truck back in to town? Okay. I got this list of things we need around here. Earl and the boys have their hands full. Everything's ready and waiting, just needs to be picked up. Useful at last. Feels so good. Just wait 'til the crew comes tomorrow to start setting up the festival; going to be more to do. - I will be here. - Okay. Thanks for all your help, Tyler. Can you make sure that all this is on the ranch account? Will do. - Try A-minor. - Excuse me? The chord you're looking for: if you go from the G to the D, then try the A-minor, then back to the C? Might work. And... who are you again? Just somebody who knows a little about chord progressions. - You sounded kind of stuck. - Is that how it sounded? - 'Cause I wasn't. - If you say so. Sounded stuck. I wasn't stuck. I was just exploring where to go next. - Maybe try exploring A-minor? - That won't work. It won't work if you don't try it. Did it ever occur to you that I might actually know what I'm doing? - No. Not once. Good luck! - Thank you. You just look more and more like your mother every day. She used to love to sing almost as much as you, too. - She loved music more than anything. - There were a couple other things. You, for instance. Is that why she never made a go of it in Nashville? That might be one reason. People spend their lives looking for something and I think she just found what she was looking for right here. Are you coming to Jenny's place tonight? Hear me sing? I'm going to do my best, but I have to meet with the festival board and you know how that can go. But you go show them what Nashville's missing. I will. Not a word from Duke yet. If we're gonna write this together-- Grady, the label needs that song no matter who writes it. A hit song doesn't happen overnight. Especially if one of the writers won't answer his emails. Between us, Duke's getting a little too big for his hat lately. So, do this for you, if not for him. You got the short end of the stick early on; this is your opportunity to show them what you've got. - And all I need's a number one song? - Is that asking too much? Yeah. How hard could it be? Hey. Welcome, my friend. What can I get you? - Little inspiration, maybe? - That was last week's special. Yeah, just my luck. Well, then a beer. Whatever you got on tap. - You got it. - Okay. I know it's a clich√© but this really is a small town. Look who it is. You ever find that lost chord? - Turns out you found it for me. - I'm glad it worked out. The chord worked; the song didn't. You here for the entertainment tonight? - Yeah. In a way. - Yeah? Anything worth listening to? Everybody says she's great, but... can never really tell. Straight from Nashville, I hear. Okay! Good evening, folks. How's everybody doing? Good? That's what I like to hear. You picked a great night to come because we have a special guest. One of my oldest and dearest, direct from Nashville, please give a warm welcome: Shayna Judson! Hello, Silverado. It is so good to be back. I see so many familiar faces out there. A stranger or two, as well. Tonight I'm going to start with a tune I wrote a long time ago. Hope you guys enjoy it. She's great. Okay, listen up, everybody. The festival starts on Wednesday and runs through to Duke Sterling's concert on Saturday. So we only have a few days to pull everything together. Now, Earl here has all your assignments. If you have any questions, just check with me. So thank you so much! Let's get to work! Anybody want to help me set up my tent. Somehow, I wrangled myself a prime spot. It doesn't hurt that Adelaide is your aunt. But, yeah. Yeah. Whose this guy? Can you give me a minute? Surprised to see you here. You looking for another songwriting lesson? Looking for you, actually. So many fans last night, didn't get the chance to tell you I really like your voice. Thank you. How did you find me? - Pays to advertise. - Right. This is where the Music Festival happens. - Yeah. My family's ranch. - It's quite the spread. - What keeps you busy out here? - We board horses. Riding, training. Lessons, if you're looking to brush up on your cowboy credentials and, of course, the annual fair. But seriously. You came all this way because... My name's Grady Connor. I think you're really talented and I'd like to hear more of your music. Do you know how many times I've heard that line? I'm serious. Okay. Card's a bit worn. It's been in there awhile. - Sorry. - Smoky Mountain Records. - That's Duke Sterling's label. - And a lot of other talent. Look, you have a fresh ear for melody. Your lyrics could use another pass but I think you have something special. Maybe we could try to write a song together. - I don't think so. - Come on. Give it some thought. Check me out. My number's on the card. - You're real good. - Except for my lyrics, apparently. I think I can help. Just think it over. You know where to reach me. - You sure this isn't a line? - Not a line. Definitely a line. - He's kind of cute. What did he want? - He wants to write a song with me. - That is totally a line. - Totally. Come on. - Crowds used to be bigger. - The festival hasn't started yet, Duke. And you're the main attraction, so by Saturday you'll be mobbed. Well, come on. Don't keep 'em waiting. Come on, now! Let's hear it for Duke! If this is a Silverado welcome, then I'm never leaving! Good to see you. It's good to see you. How you doing? - We love you so much! - Thanks, Duke. Sorry. I gotta take care of some business, but I'm here all week, so those of you I missed, we'll catch you later, all right? Come on in. Find a seat. Hard to choose where; there's so many of 'em. - Hey, Carl. - Grady. So, it's come to this? I call it home. Let me leave you boys alone to talk. Expecting great things, Grady. Yeah. - Remember that night? - Yeah. It was Austin. That's when we first started. We look like kids there. We were. Both so green. It was fun, sure, but we had no idea how the business really worked. So, I sent you a couple ideas for this song the label wants. I haven't heard back. Gotta be honest: doesn't really feel like me. Yeah, but isn't that the idea? Write a song like we used to write. We just need to figure a way to make it work. You know, and this time, we both need to have credit for it. There it is. I'm not gonna have this same old fight with you over and over, Grady. Happens every time we're in the same room. You're right. This isn't going to work, is it? You and me. Okay, I'll tell you what: I'll come up with something and send it your way and you either sing it, or you don't. No lie: I need a big hit here. So... truce? - Truce. - All right. - See ya, Carl. - Later. - Shayna? What's up? - Have you ever heard of Grady Connor? Doesn't ring a bell. Wait! Is that the guy? The guy with the line? Yeah. It turns out he is completely legit. He's written for every artist that you could possibly think of, including Duke Sterling. - Are you kidding? - No! Shayna, you need to jump on this opportunity! You know that I need a break from the business right now. Yeah, well, maybe music isn't ready to take a break from you. Can't see me right now, but I have my serious face on. Don't mess this up. What if it just ends in more rejection? What if it doesn't? - Okay, I gotta get set up. - Kay. I'll catch you later. Mr. Connor. Hi. Shayna Judson. I'd like to talk to you about writing that song. Thanks again for coming. Okay, so tell me again what the deal is? Just so we're clear. We write a song, you and me. One song. We both like it-- You'll give it to your label? Better, maybe. Let me be straight with you. The last few months, I've hit a wall. And now... I need to come up with something: a new song for Duke Sterling. What? Did you just said Duke Sterling? - Maybe. - You just said Duke Sterling! Let's see what we come up with. Just as long as you know that this is serious for me. I've given everything I've got to this business and all it's gotten me is back to where I started. Music is all I've been able to think of since I was old enough to hold a guitar. It didn't happen for me overnight, but it happened. I want to sing. I want to write and I want people to hear what I have to say. Shayna, this is as big a deal to me as it is to you. How is that true? You've got a deal, a contract, a catalogue most artists would die for. Yeah, but it's been a while since I've had a real hit. I need a fresh way of looking at things, you know? I'd really like someone to bounce things off of. You think that someone might be me? We're not going to know unless we try. But I really like what I've heard from you so far. So, what do you say? Where do we start? - You wrote all these? - I did! I've always had songs running through my head. Your music's great. Love these melodies, but your lyrics could... Right. That's what you said. What about my lyrics? What am I trying to say? Your lyrics... They could be more personal. What do you mean, "personal"? Like love song personal? That's one approach. If you've lived it. - You've been in love? - Once or twice. You? Yeah, enough to know I wouldn't mind feeling it again sometime. I don't mean to interrupt. I just thought you might like the taste of a nice, hot cider. There you go. Jeremy Judson. You can call me Jud. This is my dad. Dad, this is Grady Connor. The songwriter that Shayna was looking up online. Just to make sure you were who you said you were. He is. Nice to meet you, sir. And thanks for this. The sun's going down before too long. We're having a little family gathering tonight. You'll join us. I appreciate the invitation, but I don't want to impose. That wasn't a question, son. Nothing like a family gathering to get to know a person. All right. Welcome to Silverado. Hey, everybody! This is Grady. Grady, this is everybody. - Hiya, Grady. - Hi. Hey, Shayna! How 'bout a song? - Guitar's handy. - Anything for you, Earl. All right. Molly, get this young man a marshmallow. Ranch tradition. - Try it. - Thank you. Let's see. All right. We spent hours yesterday trying to write a song and came up with nothing. I imagine it's the whole "getting-to- know-you" process, isn't there? Yeah, but I want to get this done in time to slip it to Duke Sterling. Do you know how great that would be if he sang my song on Saturday? I don't know much about the country music business, but you sure you can count on that? It is a longshot, but... If he didn't think you were talented, he wouldn't have offered this, right? Maybe he sees more in you than you see in yourself. Okay, so is this the part where you give me a pep talk and tell me everything's going to be okay? Someone has to. - I know what could help. - What? - Singing for me again tonight. - Jenny... You know that I'm asking because I'm in a bind. Fine. Those the ideas from Grady? Most of 'em are just a riff on the same old stuff we used to do. Yeah, which is what the label wants. Come on, Carl. I want to surprise my fans; show 'em there's more to me than they know. Then you figure how to please the label. In the meantime, you have two dozen fledgling songwriters eager to bask in your creative wisdom, so let's move it. What's the last song you wrote? The last song I wrote, or the last one that was any good? - Gentleman's choice. - It was a love song. - About my pickup. - Your pickup truck?! - No! - It was. Was it any good? It was a love song about a truck, so no. What was the last song you wrote? "Down Home Tennessee." About growing up on the ranch. Playing in the fields, working the horses... And I bet the lyrics were terrific. The best songs are authentic. Personal experience. So, we just need to find the right inspiration, yeah? Yeah. Okay. Grab that notebook. Follow me, good sir. - Here we are! - It's hard to believe you grew up here. This is incredible. Yeah. I guess I never knew how lucky I was, you know? It's always just... home to me. Where were you raised? The mean streets of Nashville. Don't get me wrong! It was great. But it was a big city compared to all this. Sidewalks and playgrounds. Skateboards. Guitar lessons. - But to have all this, every day... - Yeah. My Mom used to bring me down here all the time. Especially this time of year. She always said she did her best songwriting down here. - She was a musician, too? - Yeah! My mom. She was good. She was really good. She had this nice career starting and my Dad was super supportive, but when it came down to the ranch or the road, her heart was here. She still played bars and cafes around Silverado. My Dad, when I was little, used to sneak me in so I could watch her perform. Yeah. More than anything, I wanted to be her when I grew up. What if our song is about finding love? You know? Knowing that your true love is out there, somewhere, and you just haven't found that person yet. - That's not bad. - What? What are you thinking? You know I've seen you perform twice now? Yeah. And you're different when you're up on stage. - You're not the real you, not this you. - Nobody wants to see the real me. Last night at the bonfire it was just you and that song. Yeah. That's with friends. The stage is so different. You know that. Right. But it doesn't mean you should forget who you are. Songs come from the heart. It doesn't matter where you play them. I'll remember that, Grady Connor. Welcome, everyone! Some fresh faces here tonight. Y'all here for the Music Festival? So just go up there, be myself? - That's the idea. - It might be easier said than done. So a good friend of mine sang here the other night and she was so good that we decided to bring her back. So please give a warm Silverado welcome to my dear friend Shayna Judson. How y'all doing tonight? Okay. So, tonight, I'm going to do something a little more laid back, if that's all right. You know what? I think I'm going to need some harmony for this song. So... Hey, Grady. You wanna come give a girl a hand? Grady Connor, everyone. Give him some encouragement. Come on up here. Is that Grady? I didn't think he performed anymore. Who's that with him? Yeah can we get two, two beers? What's going on? It's Duke. - Want to meet him? - Yeah. Okay, everybody, we'll be right back. Quick break. Ready? Thank you. Grady. It's been a long time since I've seen you up on stage. I'm just helping a friend, is all. May I say you have great taste in friends. Care to introduce us? Duke, this is Shayna Judson. - Shayna. Nice to meet you. - I am such a fan. I... My family owns the ranch that the festival will be on this weekend. You'll have to give me a tour of the place. Yeah. Any time you're out that way. I think we'd all like to hear you finish the set. No one's going to want to pay attention to me with Duke in the room. I will pay attention. This is Carl Campbell, my manager. Actually, Carl and I met last week. In Nashville. - In Nashville? - For the backup singer auditions? Of course. Yeah. I'm sorry that didn't work out. Carl, how could you let a voice like this slip by? - I think a do-over is called for. - That would be really great. Maybe I could sing the song that Grady and I are writing for you? You and Grady? Hey. I can't wait to hear it. Shayna, I think the audience is getting restless. Oh, right! Sorry. It was really nice to meet you, Duke. Pleasure's mine. You're writing a song together? Coming up dry on your own, are you? It's something we're trying. We'll see where it all goes. You look tired. Jenny said she had the best night in years! I can't believe I just met Duke Sterling. Did I make a fool out of myself? I feel like I always think about what I should have said. - Or shouldn't have and... - You were fine. Was there something going on with you two? Thought you guys were friends? - Long story. - My favorite stories are the long ones. Forget that. Now that he knows about the song, we've gotta make some serious headway. I came up with a few lines; an idea for the melody to run by you. Based off what we talked about today? When can I hear 'em? Give me a chance to flesh it out a little first. I don't want to embarrass myself. - Okay, well, good night. - Night. Duke Sterling... Hey, Ron. Just making sure your phone still works. Awfully quiet on the Silverado end of the line, Grady. There's not a lot to report as yet. Getting close to something. You and Duke working okay together? Me and Duke, yeah, not so much. But like you said, as long as the song is good, who cares, right? Yeah, I guess so. I'm hearing rumors: there's a woman involved now? Yeah, her name's Shayna Judson. We're putting our heads together on a song, seeing where it goes. But I think we have something special. As long as you're talking about the song. You need this, too, Grady, remember that. 'Course I remember. You're not gonna let me forget that. Okay then. Keep me posted, okay? Given up on love 'Til you showed up And walked through that door... And then it goes somewhere else from there. But your tune's good. It's really good. Yeah? Well, I even hear some of my own words in there. You should. It's a riff on everything we've been talking about. - Sounds more personal when you sing it. - That means I'm doing my job. - You got that oven working overtime. - Pumpkin pies for the festival. Faster I finish these, the faster I help finish that song. So, mind putting these oven mitts on and taking them out for me? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. They're a couple of beauties! Going for a blue ribbon? These aren't contest pies. These are eating pies. For the bake sale. Let me make some room. - Where would you like these? - Right here, please. Thank you. - That one's cooled down? - Yeah. Excuse... Paying customers only. Step away from the pie. All right. Thanks, by the way, for last night: singing with me on stage, introducing me to Duke... I still cannot believe that that happened. Yeah. That was something. His manager called, by the way, about the second audition. For the backup singer? Getting a spot on Duke's tour would boost my career. - You can try this one. - All right! - That's really good. - Yeah? If singing doesn't work out, you got a career as a baker. You helped me find a different road One that I'd never traveled before Now I feel I can carry that load You gave me the strength And so much more. That's not it yet. We're gettin' there. But I think we can take it a lot farther. This is a song about knowing that true love is out there somewhere, right? - And how life changes when you find it. - Yeah. You believe in love, right? I mean, deep, true love? Yeah. Of course, I do. Okay. So, what does that mean to you, then? Oh, Grady, that's... You should know by now that I'm not good at expressing stuff like that. Come on. Describe the person who you want to spend the rest of your life with. Okay, let's try something: close your eyes. - What? - Trust me. Close your eyes. All right, now visualize what you want that to look like for you. I want to be sure. I want it to be easy, for once. I'm tired of falling and getting my heart broken. And when we look at each other, I just want us to know, you know? I want to look him in the eyes and know that everything's okay. My heart's been broke a thousand times It feels like it took years to find The one to turn those wrongs to rights Now it's all right - That's it! - How did you just do that? How did you, like, take my heart and make it sing? Okay. Do you remember it, though? - All right. My heart's been broke. - Yes. 'Cause it has. Yeah. A thousand times. Sorry to bother you two but we have a guest. Duke? Hope I'm not interrupting anything. I just wanted to check out the venue and maybe get that tour you promised me. Well, yeah, it's perfect timing. - Isn't it, Grady? - Yep. - Then I'm all yours. - Great. - You go on ahead. I've seen it. - Coming, Grady? No, it's all right. I'll stay here. Play around with the song a little bit. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Come on. - Suit yourself. - You good? - Yes, sir. This is quite the set-up. And it opens tomorrow? Yep. Bright and early. It's the biggest event of the year. We used to have these back home. - Tulsa. - Someone's done her homework. So, is that how you and Grady know each other? From back then? - How did you guys meet? - Grady hasn't told you? He actually doesn't talk too much about you. I was doing the roadhouse circuit, getting nowhere. One day after a gig, this guy comes up, introduces himself, says he wants to be a musician. We hit it off. - Just like that? - Just like that. And a year later we're in Nashville and I'm singing "Country Mile" on the radio, our first big hit. Oh, gosh, I love that song. But you know what my favorite of yours is? "A Life in a Love". You wrote that one yourself, yeah? Those lyrics are great. Where did you come up with that? Who knows where lyrics come from, right? Yeah. I can see why you're proud of the ranch. It's a gem. All this land and mighty fine horses, too. Do you ride? I used to, back when I had time. It's been awhile. Don't you make time to do the things you love? Where do you draw the line between Duke Sterling the superstar and Duke Sterling the person? I've been asking myself that question a lot lately. - No easy answers. - You sure make it look easy. You always look like you're having a great time on stage. Lucky fans. Some days, it's pure joy. Other days, it's like putting on a costume. Hey, Dad! Grady! You will not believe what just happened. Duke asked me to sing at the music festival Saturday night. - With him on the main stage. - That's fantastic. Thank you. My pleasure. Hope I was right to say yes. It's a great opportunity, a featured spot. I know, but am I ready for that? I've been in this business for years. Voices come and go all the time. But the ones who last are the ones who have something special. Something nobody's heard, nobody expects. - And you have that. - You think so? Anybody who doesn't see that, or hear that, doesn't know what they're talking about. Shayna, you are one of a kind. But, first things first, we still have a lot of work to do on the song, so I better get back to the motel. - Yeah. - Night. Right over here! Writing just feels so different right now, you know? It's like... It's exciting again! I was up all night working on these lyrics. - Grady's really got you digging in. - Yeah, well, it has to be perfect. I still don't know what I'm going to sing on Saturday. You have plenty of time. The show's not for three days. I do not have plenty of time. The show is in three days! It depends on how you look at it, see. - Oh, hey, Mr. Judson! - Hey. You must be pretty proud of your girl, here. - Only every single day of her life. - Let's see how you feel after Saturday. You're going to be incredible and you know it. It's just... With Duke headlining, this place is going to be packed. I've never sung in front of that many people before. Just keep in mind that most of the folks are going to be there love you already: friends and family, people you grew up with, babysat for... - Dated. - It's Duke who should be nervous. You got the home-town advantage and they're all going to love you. Me and Jenny are going to be your... What's that word? "Posse." - My posse? - That's right. Look at you, Mr. Judson! When did your father become so cool? - I don't know. - Never. For that, you get a spiced cider on the house. Thank you very much. - Ladies, see you later. - See you! Grady, you're missing all the action. Festival's in full swing. - Shayna's down there helping Jenny. - The song needs some work. Shayna asked me to meet her here in a bit. Could I ask you a question? How do you really feel about Duke Sterling asking Shayna to sing with him? - It's great. Just great. - Why don't I believe you? No, it is. It's going to be a showcase for her. I just hope with the rehearsing and all we'll have time to polish the song. Right. So, you're concerned about her spending time with Duke because of the song? Mostly the song. Yeah. And yet, I just told you Shayna's down there at the festival and you're still standing here. Come here. Do you want some corn? That's good. That's really yummy. Good job! I got you. - Making new friends? - Not so new. This here is Pumpkin. She was all round and her face was all orange when she was born. - So, we call her... - Pumpkin? Yeah. Every time I pass by, I can't help but stop and say hello. Here, you hold this. Say hello to Grady. I'm not Grady... - Pumpkin, what's this? - Say hello to Grady. Sorry I'm running late. I wanted to make sure that I stop by Jenny's booth, you know? Make sure that she had everything handled. But we can begin work whenever you want. Actually, I was thinking, opening day and all, we got a really good jump on that lyric and the tune's good. The verses are pretty solid. I think we've got a good start. - So, maybe we deserve a break. - Yeah, maybe we do. - Yeah? - Yeah. - She thinks so. - Have you walked around yet? - A little. Not too much, though. - Let's go. Let me show you around. Yeah, I was listening to some of your old songs. That one that you wrote for Becky Shaw, "Dancing at Dawn"? - Still my absolute favorite. - That was just an album cut. - We didn't release that as a single. - Doesn't make it any less awesome. You are awesome. Why do you need my help? The label lost faith in my ability to do it on my own. I did too. I guess I've always been better with the right partner. - And early on, that was Duke. - Early on. - My favourite game. Come on! - What? Okay. Here, here. Always my favourite carnival game. Hey, Tyler. So, do you know how to play this? You do? I'm going to tell you anyway. You have to knock down all six bottles in one throw. You don't have to tell me. I'm the unofficial state champion. Well, then, I think that you will have to prove yourself. All right. - Okay, no laughing. Look... - No! - I'm just warming up. - Yeah. I think that you should just be warmer than whatever that was. Fair. All right, so I'm a little rusty. Three more? - This one's the good luck one. - You mind if I give that a shot? Duke? I thought you were welcoming the newbies? I was. And now, I'm just seeing what else the festival has to offer. It's a lot harder than it looks, Duke. I think I can handle a couple milk bottles. - Just going to step back here. - I think we got an audience. - You ready for this? - Yep. Make you a little bit nervous? I was aiming for that. This close. Can I have a ball, Tyler? That, boys, is how it's done. Thank you, Tyler. Who's up for ring toss? Come on, boys! And I know it's true And if I'm crazy, then you are, too If there's one thing I was meant to be It was... So close, but the bridge is not quite right. I know. You think it's the tune, or the lyrics? - One or the other. - That's a safe bet. Yeah. We'll figure it out. You maybe want to go back to the festival tonight and check out some music? Grady, I'd love to but I told Duke I'd go to Jenny's place tonight. - You should come with us. - Right. Yeah, I'll think about that. When are you gonna tell me what happened between you two? It's just the way it is. Life happens, people change... I have to take that. Excuse me. Hey. What's up? Who's this Shayna Judson I keep hearing about? You really need to start listening, Ron. I told you. The woman I'm writing the song with? - And now she's opening for Duke? - That might be stretching a point. - She's singing a number, Duke's idea. - She that good? Duke and I don't see eye to eye on many things these days but, yeah. Yeah, she is. And, y'know, I wouldn't want another label to spot her first. Maybe you should come on out here; listen for yourself. - Maybe I will. Good idea, Grady. - I still have one now and then. - That's a good one. - Thank you. What? I didn't know what to wear. No, you look perfect, girl. Is this is for Duke? No, it's not "for Duke". It's... What do you wear when a country star asks you out? This'll get his attention. Are you and he... Stop it. No, we're here to listen to the band and talk about the show on Saturday. Place is jumping. Yeah, some folks might've got the idea that you'd be here so... Now how would they know that? It's a small town. People talk. Okay, I talk. What can I say? You're good for business. Why don't you guys take a seat. I'll send someone over to get you some drinks. - Oh, thanks, Jenny. - On the house. If you're ever looking for a manager, that girl wouldn't be your worst choice. - You look very pretty tonight. - Thank you. So, we're hurrying to get you the song, so you have time to practice. Don't worry about me. I'm a quick study. Have I told you how much I appreciate what you're doing for me? And for all the struggling musicians in this town this week? You can't even begin to imagine. I've been there. Not an easy business. Sometimes you need a helping hand. I had that. So this is just me paying it forward. Welcome one and all. You're all here for the Music Festival, I bet. I thought so. We're going to play one for you that y'all know and love. As a matter of fact, this one's written by a good friend of ours and he happens to be here tonight. And I think, with a little encouragement, he might come on up here and help us out. What do you think? No, Lonnie, no. This is your night. You know they're not going to stop 'til you get up there, right? All right. Come with me. Oh, no. No-no-no-no-no! I love this place. Come on. Bring it on home! You sound incredible onstage. If you liked that, wait 'til you hear the song we're working on for Saturday. See you then! Hey, I'll be right back. - Grady! - Thanks. Thank you. - Wait up! - Thanks, man. Hey! Grady? Why did you leave? There's too many people in there. Just needed some air. C'mon. That's not it. Tell me. "We can't wait for you hear the song we've been working on." - He didn't mean it like that. - He meant it exactly like that. - What is your problem with Duke? - I can't trust him. Why? What did he do? - He stole my song. - What? What song? That song. The one you just sang with him. "A Life in a Love". We wrote that song together, but then he took all the credit for it. He made it this huge hit and now everyone, they think it's his. If that's true, why didn't you sue him, or go to the press, or something like that? 'Cause just like that, he was Duke Sterling. One of the most powerful men in country music. If I'd have gone after him, I would've never worked again. That doesn't sound like the Duke I know. That's because you don't really know him. Hey! If he did that to us, I'd drop out of the festival. - No. You can't do that. - Why? Why not? There's a record label coming to hear you sing. - How do you know that? - Because I asked them to. You did that? For me? I believe in you, Shayna. I'm serious. Look, this is your shot. You have to take it. Grady! Powerful feeling. The stage. The spotlight. All those people cheering just for you. Feel it once, it's hard to walk away from. You disappeared on me last night. It was late. And I figured it would take you awhile to get away from that autograph line. We wanted to get this to you. It's the newest version of the song, mine and Grady's. - Just so you have an idea. - Okay. Great. I'll have a look. Great. Is there something else on your mind? Grady told me about "A Life in a Love". You want to hear my version? Chances are I come off a bit better in it. We'd been writing together a while. Good songs, but nothing caught fire. And then he brought me that set of lyrics. I loved it. Heck, everybody loved it. Label wanted to release it as my first single, but only if it had my name on it. Why? Why would they do that? They wanted to build me up as this big-time, authentic country music artist and they thought a song that wasn't 100% mine would hurt that. So... So, they told everybody you wrote it. I could've told reporters, set the record straight, but I didn't. It's on me. I guess it's kind of what you said earlier, right? That one shot at fame. I apologized. I tried to explain. Made sure Grady got every penny he deserved, but, well, he's a proud man. He was a good friend once. I don't have many of those. I'm not trying to come off like it's so hard to be famous, but sometimes you have to choose between your career and the people you care about. I hope you never have to make that choice 'cause sometimes, it's sad to say, the career wins. Hey. Got your message. Yeah. I knew you couldn't turn down an invitation to see Pumpkin again. Look, about the other night, I've been thinking: I didn't need to dump all that me-and-Duke stuff on you. It's just sometimes I let it get to me. I'm sorry. No, what happened to you is wrong. And, honestly, I have no idea how I would handle that kind of situation if I was in your shoes. Do you think that the two of you should talk about it, though? I've tried that over and over again. It never gets us anywhere, though. It's a shame, too. Man, he and I were a good team. And so are we. You and I have something special and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate everything that we're doing together. I really enjoy working with you, too, Grady Connor. Nothing's ever going to get in the way of that. You've helped me remember what I love most about music. Even my lyrics have gotten better, somehow. Actually, about that, I just talked to Duke... Wait, you talked to Duke? - Yep. - What did he say? Wants us to look at the bridge and a couple of the lyrics, but I think we knew that. - Yeah. - Yeah. Shayna, Duke's looking for you. We need a time through your number for lights and sound. Okay. This'll be quick, right? So that we can polish the song this afternoon? That won't give Duke and the boys enough time to rehearse it if he wants it in the show tonight. That's okay, go ahead. That's fine. I can handle what's left. On your own? That's our song, Grady. It still will be. It'll always be our song. - Now go. Get up on that stage, girl! - Okay. All right. - I got a VIP pass. - Looks good. Check, check. One, two. - I can't hear it. - One, two, three... - Shayna? - Yeah? So sorry. We're having a bit of a sound issue. Give us ten? Sure. They said that, like, an hour ago. They need to fix this. Shayna, this is your big break. What's going on with you? Grady. He wants to polish the song by himself and I just... I can't help but feel like I'm letting him down in the moment he needs me most. Maybe you need to decide what's more important. Okay, what we're going to do, we're going... Tell Duke I'll be back soon as I can. Don't just stand there. We've got work to do. What about your rehearsal with Duke? I have sung that song a million times. First things first. And Duke's okay with this? All right, then come on in. - No... Not here. - Then where? - That's my hat. - Come with me. All right. - She was just here. - I know. But she said she was going to be right back. - Carl! - Yeah. Hold on. One sec. - What's up? - Where's Shayna? I don't know... exactly. Her stomach, or something. But I'm sure she'll be... With Grady. We were talking about choices. I guess she made hers. That's it. Now we just got to write it down. Sounds more like Duke than Duke. Just need to get these changes to him and then... Well... that's that. - That's that. - Yeah. I'll just get this written out for Duke and the band, then. - You guys need to sing this as a duet. - Me and Duke? No, no. Yeah, it's the perfect song for the two of you. Duke's a smart man. He'll see that. No, Grady, if I'm going to sing this with anybody, that somebody should be you. No. Are you imagining that something's going on between me and Duke? No! It's just, look... You're already going to be there. Yeah. Nobody wants to see the two of us up there. They want to see Duke. And as soon as you start singing, they're going to want to see you too. Yeah, I don't care what they want. If you're going to be there, you should be up there. I won't be. Because I can't. I've got to finish this up and then get back to Nashville tonight. - To Nashville? Tonight? - Yeah, I've got a job waiting there. It's... I thought I told you about it, didn't I? No. Grady... You're on the edge of something huge, Shayna. Please don't let anything get in the way of that. The truth is: you don't need me. And, between us, you don't need Duke Sterling. - You got this. - No. You can't just leave. Not... not until we talk more. I'm sorry. I... Hey, Jenny, is everything okay? Wait, wait, slow down. What is he... I'm in the middle of... Okay. Yeah. No. Okay. I'll be right there. - Duke needs me back at rehearsal. - You got to go. Hey, Carl! Hey. Where's Duke? You missed the sound check, the rehearsal... No, but I'm here now. I can explain. Okay. Duke asked me to call Lonnie's band to take your spot. - What? - He's sorry this didn't work out. Wait, but Carl, this is for him. Yeah, I know you're disappointed about not being on stage tonight. - No! That is not what this is about. - I'm sorry, Shayna. Okay, this whole thing has just gotten way out of hand. Okay, what is really going on here? People sometimes want to get near Duke so they can take advantage of his fame, or his money. So, when he decides to get close to somebody and really trust them and they aren't there for him... Wait, he doesn't think that that's me? Or is this all about Grady? They have a complicated history. - Yeah, I know. I know about the song. - It was never about that. He always knew Grady was a better songwriter. What does that matter? He's Duke Sterling. He's number one on the charts. He's famous, he's rich... And he's a guy who doesn't always feel like he's good enough. - Carl, you've gotta le me talk to him. - It won't do any good. There's only one person I've ever known who could talk any sense into him. Okay. Then that's who we need to get. Grady? Pick up, Grady, come on. Shayna, Mr. Connor left something for you. Thank you. I'm so proud of us, proud to have written this with you. But the label needs a song by Duke Sterling, so I'm giving him this one. - For him. And for you. - No, no. Come on. Come on, Duke. I'm not leaving 'til you talk to me. - Duke! - Knock all you want. Nobody's home. So, I've been making a fool out of myself here for nothing? I am so sorry I ran off, I really am, but, please: you got to give me a second chance. - I don't know, Shayna. - I had to finish the song. It is so important for you and you know it's important for me, too. This is from Grady. It's the final version. - Why isn't he giving it to me himself? - Because he left. He seems to think that there's something going on between you and me. My name's on this. He said that there's a record guy coming tonight and he wants to hear a song by Duke Sterling. That's it. Grady wanted it this way? He did that for you. Honestly, when I look at the two of you, I don't see one of you being better than the other. All I see is two really, really good men who have one very annoying thing in common. What's that? They are too stubborn for their own good. You may have something there. What you said the other night... I don't let people close, either. But when I do, it's for life. I hope that includes you. If you hurry, you could probably squeeze in a rehearsal. Not that you need it. I'll go over these changes. We'll sort the Grady stuff out tomorrow, okay? Really? - Hold on a minute. - Yeah? - This is a duet now? - Yeah. It just kind of ended up that way. So, I guess you'll be needing someone to sing it with? Guess I will. - You good here? - Yeah. - It's a crazy week, huh? - I'll say. - I'm so proud of you, Shayna. - Doing a show with Duke is a big deal. I was proud of you when you were playing those little bars up in Nashville. No. I'm proud of you because of you; because of the woman you've become. Thanks, Dad. - I only wish Mom was here. - She is. You know she is. Before you go, thought maybe you could use this. - That's Mom's guitar! - Yeah. I been meaning to give it to you for a while and then time seems especially right tonight, so... You know your Mom would want you to have it. You have no idea how much this means. Yes, I do. Hey, it's Grady Connor. I'm not here but leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hey, Grady! It's Shayna. I just want to say, again how much I appreciate everything that... I wish you didn't go. We were great together. We made each other great. So, if you're ever back in town, you know... Alright. Yeah, alright. Okay. - You look like a rock star. - You don't look so bad yourself. - Thank you. - Thank you again for everything. What are friends for? Shayna, they're ready for you. - For me? - Local girl makes good. You go get 'em started. I'll be right there to join you. - You're going to be great. - So are you. Okay. I'm going! - Bye. - Knock 'em dead. - Here she is. - Thanks. - Grady. - Carl. - Grady, I heard you left. - I did. And then I realized there was something I needed to do. Look, Carl sent me the tracks of your album. You don't need another song, especially from me. - It's perfect the way it is. - That means a lot coming from you. - Thanks, Grady. - Yeah. And c'mon: you're Duke Sterling. Do the album you want. If Ron doesn't like it, you know how many other labels would love to sign you? Come on. - Hi, everyone. - Duke! Are you ready to see Duke Sterling? - Is that the only reason you came back? - No, it's not the only reason. So, how 'bout a warm music festival welcome for Silverado's own Shayna Judson? Good evening, Silverado. I want to say thank you to Mr. Duke Sterling, a great guy and a great friend. And to all of you who came out tonight. As you may or may not know, it was my mom who started this music festival and look at how it's grown. It's an honor to be here tonight and I am so happy to be back home. Finally, I want to give a huge thank you to Grady Connor. This first number was inspired by him. It started out as a love song and ended as a love story. Even if he doesn't know. Okay. - The song you and Shayna wrote? - Yeah? Doesn't need me to make it a hit. - Seriously? - Seriously. ... on love, 'til you showed up And walked through that door Yeah, you turned this ship around Set sail on a different course Now I count my lucky stars each night And I know for sure That I've finally found the one. My heart's been broke a 1,000 times It feels like it took years to find The one to turn those wrongs to rights Now it's all right Baby I spent my whole life searching But all of that time, yeah, it was worth it Every long way round Every wrong turn that I took Was getting me to you I don't know if I couldn't see it Or if I just couldn't believe it Sometimes things hide in the last place that you look Yeah, but sometimes they're standing right in front of you. That's my daughter. Isn't she wonderful? Yeah. Hey, have her call me. Holy. Thank you. Baby, I spent my whole life searching But all of that time, yeah, it was worth it Every long way round Every wrong turn that I took Was getting me to you I don't know if I couldn't see it Or if I just couldn't believe it Sometimes things hide in the last place that you look But sometimes they're standing Right in front of you In front of you I'm standing right in front of you.
