* WELLS FARGO * In the early 1840's, the railroad creeping westward, had reached for as Batavia. New York... Hey Bart, come here! Get away, let it go!... Woa!... Hello Bart. Hello Ramsay, you had a good trip. Made a good trip? What, in this earthquake on wheels? Did you bring the ice? Yes, all packed in sawdust. Then unload these barrels... I have to be in Bufallo in an hour. One hour? It will be quite a walk. I've been walking a lot, get out of... New York, with baskets and a boat, I went to Albany by train to Geneva... last month and I took this wood combustion. 150 miles in two days? Traveling... Hey, the mail express correspondence. Did you receive my wife's corset? Here it is, I imagine that these will hold it. Ah, here it is, a letter to you, Erick, from that beautiful girl from the Synagogue. I hope it's worth 6 cents. If he doesn't want to, I offer 7. Here's one for you, Mrs. Bobs, it looks like Lucian's. I heard he's in. Yes, it is. Don't forget the correspondence to Bufallo. Under the accent. Sheriff? Yah!... I suppose I'm the courier in this town, right? Right. Well, all I get is three cards. What the hell, he's violating government correspondence. He is breaking the law and I demand his arrest. We have to have evidence to order an arrest. Evidences? Look here, the government has a monopoly on correspondence, is it true or not? Yes right. That guy is working without a license. You are embezzling money from the government and it is your duty to prevent this. I think you're right. I know I'm right, come on. Even the Ramsay view. Wait, Ramsay. Get out of there, you're stuck. Of course it is. Arrested, but why? For competing with the postal service. We are not competing, we are taking care, in stages. Which, by the way, is very good. He only charges 6 cents and the government charges 25. And mail arrives faster. Much faster. My sister had three boys and I didn't know she was married. Aren't you going to do your duty, sheriff? You better get down there, Ramsay. I'm sorry, sheriff. But I cannot be arrested today. I have to do thirty miles to Buffalo. Talk to me another time. So I go up to get it. I'm sorry, sheriff, no passengers, this is an express. Hey, come back here!... Are you going to Bufallo? You can be sure of that. Do you mind saying we're with problems and send us another coach No doubt, we will. Hey, please wait. Justine. You are not going to abandon us in this desert, are you? Can we accompany you to Bufallo? It is, of course, a pleasure, but I... Mom! I would love to be of service to you, madam, the only problem is that I think... he would not feel well in that old and falling wagon. Oh, I would love to, I've never been on a cart before. Mom. This gentleman kindly offered to take us to Bufallo. It doesn't look very fascinating. Is the cart safe, boy? He has done good service for years, but I cannot guarantee that he will be comfortable. No, I don't think so. Oh, mom, come on. It will be an adventure. Humm!... Allow me I think it's best to sit in the mailbox. Oh, how wonderful. Allow me, madame. No, thank you, I can still climb very well. Thank you, you are very kind. You're welcome. C'mon C'mon. Slower, boy, slow down. I'm sorry, I have to be in Bufallo in an hour. Come on, go!... "WESTERN ESPRESS CO." Personally I believe it would be a great success. But the idea of a land express to Saint Louis is absurd, Wells. Why not stay where people are, this is what business is all about. Going where people are going is a much better deal. Don't go and tell me you're going to Missouri. All of them, Mr. Bradford. Ah, nothing!... Absurd, that is an isolated place. Nothing but Mexicans and Indians. I am sure they will not want your express service. You forget the Republic of Texas. Sam Justin and hundreds of Americans respected it. I'm sorry, Wells, I'm a conservative banker. In my opinion, Ohio River boats are... Ohio River boats are too slow. They will not support speed and progress, especially those settling in the new territory. Hello good day. Now a good day everyone. Hello Bradford, it looks like you will be the guest of honor. What is this surprise that you are saving for us? Something to eat, I hope. I'm starving. He is the host, Mr. Wells, he who is keeping it a secret. But it will be good, he is after my bank account. Come on, see what it is. You have to control your curiosity, for some time, gentlemen. But I can guarantee that it is worth it. I hope so. Excuse. Hello Pryor... I'm glad to see you here. Nice to see you, Bradford. Your lovely wife and daughter, are you all right? Very well, thank you. They are currently traveling. Woa, woa, woa!... Hey!... I'm sorry, ma'am. Adele, my dear. Oh, Nicholas, never again in my life. The carriage broke down and this wild man saved me... oh, take me to the hotel. Yes, yes, of course dear, come. Good job, Ramsay, I knew I was going to be on time. Thank you sir!... Come on gentlemen. The surprise is ready. I am sorry to have caused such a terrible trip for you and your mother. Oh, don't worry. With enough rest, tranquility and a massage. I'm sure we'll be fine, in very little time. But I warned you that I was in a hurry. But not in such a hurry. After all, what's in these barrels, it's gold? No, oysters. Oysters? Fresh and alive, straight from New York and we brought it. Gentlemen, the surprise is ready. I hope you will prove to my friend, Mr Bradford, a banker with not very accessible wallet... what can be done with fast shipping. Perhaps the way to that elusive wallet is through the stomach. So I bring you today, for the first time in the history of Bufallo... Mr. Bradford's favorite dish. Fresh oysters in half shell. Oh!... My friends!... Gentlemen, on behalf of my associates, I am pleased to announce that shopping... soon, we will inaugurate the service fast by Land Express to San Louis. Oh yes, they keep me moving all the time, to New York and back almost every week. It is a very big responsibility to be a messenger for the entire Bufallo. Message boy? And you are not? Well, maybe I am but here Syracuse needs a kind of quick service. This is what is behind the thing. Behind what? Well, the whole idea of transportation, is the country's life force. Now, if we didn't have a kind of communication... cities and towns, would be stagnant. There would be no expansion, people would not go anywhere. And it wouldn't do any good to take oysters where there was no one. Isn't that it? Exact. I would like to see Mr Wells say this. Ah, you explained everything very well. I have to go, goodbye. Thank you very much. Wait a minute. I hope you don't think I'm such a careless coachman. How could I think that? But I mean it... I want to communicate with respect, will always be every day. I want it to be clarified. What a good guy and who is from Saint Louis. Where is Saint Louis? I may tell you tomorrow. Saint Louis. of course, in Mississippi, Goodbye Saint Louis. Hey, let's see what arrived!... We are now here to take care of our things. I hope you tell us everything about what to do. I hope it is in the right place and does not impose anything on us. Because they usually do this always. But it won't be that easy. We will fight to be told the truth of how it will be done. And it won't be a good way. How are we and strange place. I hope they don't take advantage of us. being quiet and not knowing things. Even more being strangers in these places. But we will ask everything we need to do what we want. You can tell us, how bank works? Yes sir, very well now. Well, the only thing you can do in the bank is to put or take what they offer us... And my stones from last year. You just said you sent them to New York. Exactly, to my agent Wells and Fargo. I am waiting for a these days. Yes, yes, but the post office is very uncertain at this time of year. There is no movement. But they promised to send a messenger overland. By overland? Did you say by overland? Yes, a new service for Saint Louis. Oh, but what an absurd idea, if you don't mind me saying it. The entire region between here and Bufallo is flooded with spring rain. Hmm, hmm!... It will be impossible to pass. It will be difficult, I prefer to say. But they will make it, I'm sure. I'm sorry I can't share your faith in... Wells and Fargo. Yes, yes, Wells and Fargo. But, I really don't see a way to serve you, Mr. Pryor. Well, I thought you were able to make an exception. It will be such a small loan and my reputation here, in this community... Sorry, Mr. Pryor. Good morning, gentlemen. Good Morning. Good Morning. Mister Pryor? Yes, Hank. I have declined a lot of jobs waiting for your expedition to leave. I knew you would want me and Pawnee to be like last year. There is no one I prefer to you, Hank, but... It?s possible that I don?t send anyone this year, you better get the first good job that comes along. To the office, Sam. Daddy. Why aren't you in bed? I wanted to say good night to you. Good night... Good evening, my dear. We wait for you for dinner for almost an hour, Nicholas. Daddy... Dad, did you eat anything? Oh yeah. I had dinner at the hotel. How are you, Talbot? Very well, Mr Pryor. Any news? Not yet. I thought so. And he has no reason to suppose that there will be tomorrow or the day after. You don't have to talk like that, I have a lot of confidence in my agents. But I don?t have to and I just sit here waiting ... it won't do any good. I should do something. That's why I called Talbot to dinner. I do not... I explained the whole situation and he offered himself generously... If I can be of service to you, sir. Advance him, some money. Thank you, my boy, but... My dear Nicholas, I really do not understand why you hesitate. It's not like Talbot is a stranger, why, he's almost one of the family. It's getting a little cold in here, I'll get your tea, mom. I'm not feeling the slightest cold and besides. I don't like to be interrupted when... Yes, I know, dear, but what do you think to put the matter aside for now. Yes of course. I'm looking for Mr. Pryor. One moment please. Oh, I didn't expect you to see him, now. Oh, you. Justine. Well, boy, am I happy to see you. I knew you would not fail. Your draft, sir. I'm sorry I was a little late but it was difficult to get horses rested... One went limp on the trail and I had to storm without the Mississippi River It looks like you had a hard trip. A glass of wine won't hurt you. all right. come on. My dear, I think you already know Mr... Mr... Mackay. Sim we have already met Mr. Talbot Carter, Mr. Mackay How are you, sir? I am sure you will excuse us, but we have to withdraw. Good night Talbot. Good night, lady. Come Justine. Good evening. Well gentlemen, I think you have to talk about business, so I'm going. It was a great pleasure to meet us here. Your visit was very nice for us. Thanks. You're welcome. Good evening. Come on, Mr. Mackay. I'm saying I don't know what made me do that, unless... I was, I was... happy for Dad. But a man you don't even know, a stranger to all of us. It is not completely strange, Mom. We traveled with him once, remember? Justine. I don't want to continue with this discussion, right now. I just want you to know that in the future I insist... appropriate behavior I know. Yes mom I suggest it?s time to leave. If you forgive me, I need to go to the hotel, I'm very tired. Oh, but you will do me the honor of accepting an inn for tonight. Very kind but I have other deliveries to make... and tomorrow morning I'm going to set up an office here. Oh so, allow me to help you with this. I go to the bank in the morning. You can meet me there, around ten. I appreciate it. Good night. Good night boy!... Mr. Mackay. I couldn't let him go without explaining why I behaved in such a bold way. Now, Miss Pryor, when? When I received it, so cordially. Look, I didn't notice anything that I could complain about. Only that. Well I only did it because it was cool, dad he was so worried... I wasn't... and I was grateful Oh, but I was just the messenger, always at your service, Miss Pryor. Well, I hope you understand. I understand you weren't happy to see it, that's all. I didn't mean it, Mr. Mackay. So you might not be disappointed... to know that I'm going to open an office here. In Saint Louis, Mr. Mackay? In Mississippi. And, by the way, I have been practicing. Practiced? Drive a carriage very slowly. If I can find a very old horse, you know, very old and decrepit. Only then would I run at 3 miles an hour. I don't think I could, mom... But I'm not inviting your mother, in fact I noticed, a beautiful shaded road along the river. With trees overhanging the water. I am not sure of power. If mom knows I was here. What would she... Oh, I shudder to think. So you better get in before she finds out. It's all right. And she can refuse to come with an old horse. You are very kind. Good night, Mr. Mackay. Good night, Miss Justine. "1846" "WELLS & FARGO Campany Express" "RAMSAY MACKAY Agent" Anything else, Ramsay? No thank you. Have you nailed the horseshoes to him? Yes, I put new shoes on it. He should step on with pride now. It looks like you did a good job. I'll tell you, if there's anything I know how to do, it's screwing horses. You know, the rumor has spread so much that when wild horses... there in the plains they come passing me they come running to me... they extend their paws and ask me to put the horseshoe on. See you, Hank. See you later. Hey, Ramsay. I have something very important to do with you. What is it, Hank? Well, you see, I'm in this job, God knows, how long and me too... Don't tell me you're going to say goodbye again. I haven't quit my job yet, you always convince me otherwise. I think I need a change. City life is killing me. You know, I want to go out into the open, where I can breathe some fresh air. Working in a stable, for so long, I will end up falling into a routine. You know, there's so much to do in a stable... that I think if the person doesn't work all the time... the service ends up accumulating on top of you. I have to go to that boat, Hank, Mr. Whells comes with him. There he is, the boat is coming. You will have to wait tomorrow to leave your job. Welcome to Saint Louis, sir. You look great. I'm feeling fine, Ramsay, and because I wouldn't be with all this excellent work that you have been doing this year. It is a pleasure to hear this, I thought you came here because you are dissatisfied. No, I come because of the confusion in the Mexico. What is the situation there? The latest news is that General Taylor had crossed the Mississippi River. They say the hostilities have already started and I think that when this war is over, I think not just Texas and California, can be in the Union This means emigration. Remember when Oregon came in? They walked through the snow to get there. That's right. Now, with an easier trip for California, there will be settlers by the thousands. And they will need communication with the east, this is why I am here. I want to send someone there to trace trails, bus stations... for a possible haul road to California. This would be quite risky, wouldn't it? Yeah, that's what Fargo said. All my partners think I'm going crazy, Well, maybe it is, but I have a strong intuition about it I see cities and towns sprouting out of nowhere. Made like a mushroom, overnight. Don't you see, Ramsay? When do you want me to leave? Well, it took you a long time to say that. It's just that I have a lot of experience from those sides, from unknown territories and... but if you can take Hank York with me. Who is it? He's been doing some beaks around here but he knows so well the plains as you know the express business It seems all right, when can you go? I need to make some preparations. Let's see, for example tomorrow. Humm!... Good, my idea of the best path... Woa!... What is that? Mr. Pryor sent us his carriage, we should already be at the party now. Do I really have to go, Ramsay? I'm not much of a partyer. Mr. Pryor was very insistent, sir. Will I have to dance? No, I'll take care of that. All right... No as for that road, Ramsay... I remember one of your birthday parties, we were this big. You were wearing a white dress and you wore long braids. It was lovely. I had lost a front tooth the day before. There was a horrible hole in my mouth, I hissed. And I ate too much ice cream. And you were sick because of this. It wasn't because of this, it was because you sat down with another boy. I remember, he was so cute, but fickle. He married someone only ten years later. Yeah, but I don't. Here I am, hoping that maybe, someday you will be interested in me. Well, how silly. I do not think. Do you think it is foolish for a man to fall in love with you? Talbot, please. You know I love you, don't you? Well, I expected you to like me... as I like you. But don't you have another person, another boy? Ah!... Good night, Justine. Good evening. Happy Birthday. Hmm!... Hello, Talbot. How are you, Ramsay? I think we were just talking about you. Forget my nonsense, Justine. My congratulations. Justine, does he know, did you tell him? No... no. Oh, Ramsay. Let's get this over with, let me tell your dad and mom tonight. We can't do this, Mom will never understand. I know, he will not consider the party suitable. Which means I don't serve you and she's right. I don't agree with either. I love you. But I have to tell them, before I leave, go away? Do not go away!... It was decided tonight, I am going to travel for Mr. Wells. Oh!... This is all yours, you scared me. He is always traveling, to Bufallo. But justine this time is different. I'm going to California. California? Yes, I leave tomorrow. Alone? No, I'm taking Hank York, with me. I wasn't thinking about him, of course he wouldn't be going that far without me. You? It would not be possible. I would be. Let's get married right now, I don't care what Mom says. It's wonderful that you want to go. But I cannot take you on such a difficult and dangerous journey. Because if it's dangerous for you. I want to be with you!... Justine, it would be crazy if you thought about it. I have to work a lot, a huge job. And after making money I will... You me!... You mean your job is more important to you than me? No, of course not... but it is my job, you understand Justine. I should have been glad that I had a chance to do such an important thing. If you leave without me, now. Justine!... I don't want to see you anymore, never Let's go to California, Pawnee. Humm!... Where you live. I was there, about three years ago, and it's quite a place. The population is also friendly... they have some great ideas on how to live. They have their parties and naps. Personally I prefer their naps. Around eleven in the morning, they just ... they drop everything and go to sleep until the end of the afternoon. This is all the money I could get, Ramsay. I would like to give you more, but I think it is enough. Don't worry, I just hope everything goes well with you. You have to give. Can you imagine how Fargo will laugh if we are biting more than we can chew? I can imagine. Here it is dear, I did not say that we would arrive in time. Ramsay, I will accompany you. What's up? Ramsay... I didn't mean that, not even a word. Forgive, yes. Now, there is nothing to forgive. I was crazy thinking about going with you But, I couldn't stand the thought of seeing him meet danger. I'll be fine and maybe very all right, I'll be back before you miss me. I will wait for you, for ever. I love you!... Don't, make this always take too long. Now go. But before I wanted to... Please, go. Please. Goodbye my boy. Goodbye Ramsay and good luck. Goodbye, sir. Come on Ramsay, come on... "SAN FRANCISCO" Attention my people!... Didn't come by the isthmus. it was done right here in California. A dollar a box, yes sir, just a dollar, come on. What happened, the mail didn't arrive? No, I guess they don't have enough employees. Have you been waiting a long time? Twelve hours so far. You will find the end of the line at the end, partner. How long will it take to discover this. I guess the only way to get a card here... is to invade and get it yourself. Come on follow him!... Come on meet us!... Come on, what's going on here That doesn't answer me, I've been waiting for a long time!... Is your name Zachary Martin? Yes, Zachary Martin. You owe me twenty-five cents. We will. As it is, I've been waiting for five hours? What's your name? It's Hampard. Hampard? Where can I find the Post Office Agent? Oh, God, did he disappear, too? Yes. There he is, right there, but he doesn't like to be disturbed when he's working. Hey, come on. Come here, serve us!... Let me help you. Hey... what do you want here? My correspondence, of course, what kind of service is this one? You're going to blame me, everyone blames me, why don't they blame the government in Washington? Those guys think San Francisco is still a village, thousands of guys... arriving every day and they all want letters. The guys in the east send letters to everyone here for the Pacific Coast. I want to make you a proposal, I'm from Hangtown, say it here. Read this here. Read you, I can't find my glasses. To the San Francisco postal agent, this is you. We, the undersigned miners of Hangtown, for the present, we authorize to deliver to the bearer, Ramsay Mackay, it's me... all correspondence and packages addressed to us. Here are the signatures. It looks like everything is cool, but you have to go outside and wait your turn. I am willing to pay the government twenty-five cents for each letter. Hmm!... Yes in addition, you will receive an extra employee for free. Well I do not know. But who are you, what is your business? Express agent Wells &amp; Fargo from Saint Louis. I've never heard of him, but I don't think you're totally dishonest. I guess I'll take the risk, raise your right arm. Swears that you are an American citizen and that you will fulfill the duties of a government official and may God protect him. I do!... Well, then you can start, subscribe... the receipt when finished. Yes sir. Hangtown, California. Ramsay. Too much gold around here? Nothing, I'm just saving this concession until find someone I live so long to give you this. You must return to work with me, I made more than five hundred dollars on this trip. Five hundred? Of course, correspondence, express and money, for the boys at five percent. Think about it, I need someone, to take my place when I go back to the east. East, do you mean Saint Louis? Of course, where did you expect me to go? Ah!... Mail!... Mail!... Mail!... Get there for me? A little more, just a minute. Grass Randall. It's me, how much is it? A little bit of money, the same as the others. Hey when such a newspaper? Ten dollars. Here they are, my ten dollars... H.C Bert? It's me. It's me. Hey wait a minute, where's my money. "RAMSAY MACKAY EXPRESS & BANKING" "Agent for WELLS & FARG" Two hundred and nine grams in weight, Wayne. That's right. He wants you to deposit with the Bank. Yes. You mean you're leaving, huh? Yes, I think we got here too late Good concessions are taken. As if there ever was a good concession in this region. Well... It looks like those guys over there found some. Certo. Here's your receipt. Thank you, Mackay. My name is Trimball, Dan Trimball. What can I do for you, Dan? I understand that you can send money to an eastern person. That's right, wherever you send me? For my city, Saint Louis. Saint Louis? Well, we have an office there. How long have you been here? About six months. Any luck? Not bad, at least it's better than working on a ranch in Missouri. Must be Two hundred and eighty-three grams of weight. Is there any chance that this will get lost on the way? Oh, no, I just take you to San Francisco. San Francisco? Yes... We have a contract, so our office in Saint Louis converts it into cash. Yes, I understood. Where do you want to send him? To the same address as this letter. Miss Lucy Dorsett. We're engaged. Here is her portrait. She is very beautiful. Oh, yes, I really wish she were here. Why don't you send for her? I can't imagine letting her come alone on this trip. Mr. Wells wrote to me that an associate of ours, John Butterfield, is planning to bring a special group here through Panama. Women too? Of course... the journey, is by the isthmus, it will not be the most pleasant, the rest of the way, by boat. When would she get here. In the middle of autumn. But It's well. I'll bring her!... Your fiancee is worth as much as this, he'll give you plenty for expenses. You boy, don't want, to take one home? Well!... No thank you. I think we?re already walking. Good luck. Thanks. Prepare you!... Who is it? Hyah!... Hey you. It looks like I hit you!... Yes. He is eliminated!... And that other bag over there? It's just correspondence, come on. "SALOON" Well, Pawnee, we have no other option!... but it never hurts to take a look, come on. Hmm!... Ramsay!... Pawnee. We will take you to the cabin. Dear Justine: I'm afraid I won't be able to see you as soon as I expected. I am in a phase of very bad luck. Do you know that you talked too much during your sleep last night? If I didn't already know that you are interested in Miss Pryor, I would not hesitate to suspect now. I couldn't close my eyes all night, I was afraid to miss something interesting. I'm falling apart... but I'm glad to see you with your head in place again. Ramsay!... you have to get out of here fast, they're after you. Who's there? The boys, they had a meeting, they don't believe it, that have been stolen. Thanks Felow No shots, Hank. Close suppose they start? What's the matter, boys? Mackay... We don't believe the story of theft Now, unless you want to tell where you hid that gold... We no longer have a thief here, since we hanged that mestizo, a year ago. I'm sorry they doubt my word but I'm happy... for coming, it saves me the trouble you of going to look for them. Abe, read this out loud. Mackay, I can't read, Do you know? But I know. Baldwin and Co. Bank, San Francisco, Certificate of deposit. Four thousand two hundred and forty dollars on credit to Ramsay Mackay. Agent for the Wells & Amp; Fargo company in Saint Louis. Bem, they are seeing more than enough to repay the losses. I mean, that they will repair the damage? Definitely, we will have everything back. I guess we were a little rushed. I'm going to San Francisco tomorrow. Two can accompany me. I will pay the totals against the receipts you have. Well, thanks Ramsay. By the way... I'll be here next week doing business at the same time. Let's check it out!... "1851" Well, here's your San Francisco. I hope it brings me luck. I hope so too, of course. Where you go? To the islands. What boats are those in our direction? They always come to pick up newspapers from Mexico. I let the first man on board buy them for a dollar each. They do a fantastic price. And that tall guy always seems to be the luckiest. Why, but that is our man, Ramsay. That was a great race. Have better luck next time, guys. Well, my boy, you were the first to go up. I got 50 for you on this trip. Fifty, is that all? I could get a hundred. Mr. Wells, how are you? Yes well. I didn't expect to find you on board. I imagined doing a surprise and giving you my moral support. I thought you needed, after that setback in Hangtown, so I raised a little more capital. Enough for the rent, for now. The rent? You mean you're going to open an office here? Why not? Ramsay, I want to introduce you to John Butterfield. Mr. Butterfield, nice to meet you, they've told me a lot about you, Mackay. They say that our friend here has crazy ideas and that you put them on, In practice It has listened to Fargo. Mr Wells? Ramsay, the bride you ordered. Safe and sound, transported with great care. You have all been so good to me. I don't even know how to thank you, but where's Dan? He's coming by boat, I didn't let him come in mine for fear that he would be turned over. Lucy? Oh, oh, Dan. Eh!... Dear. Thanks. Well, Ramsay... it will take a while to anchor and we have a lot to talk about. Come on down, do you mind? Do not. No, no, no. Come this way. Excuse. First we want to talk a little about your future. There's more time for that, sir. In between. Justine? That is not true. I will wake up in a minute. No. It is true, yes. It is true. But, your mother, how did she allow you to come here alone? Ah, I doubt she'll ever understand that. But Dad understood, it was wonderful... and when we heard that Mr. Wells was coming to bring Lucy. We decided to embark two brides instead of one. Fiancee? I... I can go back, if you don't want me. I want you. What is it? It's just water. You are here to stay, dear. We will get married immediately. "SAINT FRANCIS" Hotel & Saloon Here we are I'm sorry dear, but I think this is the best place in town. Well, it is better to remain much more to us, isn't it? Thanks. Johnatan, I want to introduce you to my wife. Delighted, Mrs. Mackay. This way, dear. Now remember, Wang, I want you to take care Mackay while I'm gone. I'll take care!... I mean, taking good care of her, being on guard, you know. Oh! ... I'll be on guard, like a soldier, I know. That's right. Well, I'll be right there, dear. Goodbye. I don't like that you have to go. Me neither. You know, since Mr. Wells, is gone things are not going very well Last month it was barely enough to cover expenses. How did that happen? Competition, quite a lot. Firms like Slade and Oliver interfering. That's why I have to go to the gold fields to get new customers. I think you're right, Ramsay, but I ... I don't want to interfere with your activities, but I was counting on going with you so much. I won't be far from you this day, I'll be back. Besides, Mrs. Andrews will be here with you and the doctor. You, but it is you that I want. I want you close to me. Will you be back in time? Yes, of course very well. Goodbye!... Goodbye!... Remember, Larry, you can't sit in the office waiting. transactions come to you, you?ll have to get them. I'm going to put on my boots. That's the way it is said, Take the mail, I'll take it with me How are you, Ramsay, in Hangtown these days. That's right, Wait. I heard that you got married. Yes, settled and with a child, except when I'm traveling. Thanks. Well everything will go, very well... Eleven my, eleven my day... Day... Gosh, Ramsay. Hank. I shouldn't be shaking your hand. What is this idea of coming here and not looking for me. I'm in a hurry, Hank. I would look for you on the next trip. I will not be here on the next trip. Because? I'm exhausted!... I've been stuck here like crazy for months... trying to find a couple of drinks and not... I was luckier than a duck with a doorknob. Are you going to resign again? You know, I've never worked so hard in my life as... Didn't you, Pawnee? Hmm!... Now that Pawnee wants a break, you might come back to work for me. No, Pawnee and I are going to the plains... back to Saint Louis. Hien!... Well, either way we can get on, with a good piece together, come on. I'm sorry I can't change your mind, Hank. No, Ramsay, as much as I want to see Miss Pryor, with your forgiveness and your wife and by the way how is she? Not as well as you might expect. I look forward to returning, so I eliminated two of the fields. It doesn't mean that she is sick. No, quite exactly... Ramsay. Wait. What's it? It's Lucy, come quickly, please What's the matter, Dan? My wife. Ten days ago I sent for the doctor in Sacramento but no one came. I don't know what I'm going to do, Ramsay. Our Lady. Listen, isn't there a woman in the country? I don't remember seeing one around here. Wait a minute, there's an Indian woman near the excavations. Pawnee! Alright Neguina, my friend!... Hmm!... He's going to bring her, she has a pimpolho. Great. Can't you do something? She can't take it. Control yourself. We have to think. Hank, make a fire we will need a lot of hot water. You help him. Take it easy boy, take it easy. I know it's hard to understand why things happen the way they do. Sometimes a long time passes before we can understand. But, after all, you did not abandon him entirely alone. There's the child. And I think she would like you to control yourself... and do everything for the little guy. But she was afraid. She knew she was going to die, she said it to me. She even made me swear, that I would send the child to her parents' home in Saint Louis. But what can I do now? She left. And the child will die now, I know it will. The little one looks fine now and I see no reason not to continue like this. But if he stays here, without proper treatment... and I promised. I don't know why you can't keep your promise. But this is impossible. Hank? You are wanting to go to Saint Louis and I want you to work for me, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. Where do you want to go? I want you to speak to the Indian husband, ask if they would come to Saint Louis with you. Tell him we will pay well. Who, me? I don't want to get involved in something like that. Say, what are you trying to get me involved in? I will speak. Normal!... White man wants you and India... Normal!... cross the country, with a child in your arms. Ramsay!... You mean that Wells & Fargo, carries anything. A child and a nurse are not going to intimidate us. If he succeeds, his son will go to Saint Louis by land. But they have to do it. Normal!... Hank, tell him I'll pay anything. Leave it to me. Yes. Leave it to me. Normal!... cross the country, with a child in your arms. Wells & Fargo!... Hein!... Wells & Fargo!... cross the country, with a child in your arms. Wells & Fargo!... Justine, are you all right, Mrs. Andrews? The doctor is still with her. But don't you want to take a look at your son? She is fine? She did not stop calling him, she was very shaken by not having come. Justine. Justine. Look at me, please. The only time I needed you... You did not come. I know. I thought I could, but look, Lucy!... Lucy Trimball, she also had a child. And I had to stay to help. after she died I... Died? I didn't stop thinking about you, even though I knew, you had a doctor and proper care. And the child... her child? You are in good hands. I knew that he would want me to do everything in my power. "1857" What is it? It's about installing the Atlantic Cape. They are always installing, never ending. Rambos' opinion on the Whig Party case. New York Herald, directly from the boat. The government has granted land mail contract. Wait, wait, wait... Delete the news about the Watch Committee. Write it down, Jew. One of the most important events in the history of Californi ... It was the granting, by Congress, of a contract for land mail, on the 15th of September. Did you read this part? As it was revealed, Ramsay Mackay, local manager, Wells & Fargo America, You will be responsible for the trip. I'm happy, he's a good man It's the nicest thing that ever happened in California. Yes, we can now receive our correspondence. Did you hear about the terrestrial? That was too much, Cordelia. Your singing was wonderful. Girls, did you hear the news? The land mail contract has been signed. Oh, oh!... Yes! You see, they say that Mr. Ramsay will be in charge. Wonderful for Ramsay and Mr Wells came to discuss the plans with him. He will have to establish, a number of bus stations between here and Missouri. What? This means that he will be gone for more than a year. I'm sorry, Mr. Wells, it's not that I don't want to go but... See... I promised Justine that I wouldn't leave San Francisco. But, man of God, our plans are aimed at that. We are counting on you. I'm sorry. You have already supervised the route we have to take. By God, man, this is no time to talk about saying, but, this service is absolutely essential. Some people here would like to break with the Union... to make California a republic. Texas and the south are unhappy and talking about Secession... The north thinks it has the right to rule the country. I'm sorry. Now, proper communication will do. I'm sorry. I prefer not to talk about this anymore. Hank knows the route as well as I do. Why not leave him in charge. Hey, wait a minute. I don't want to tie myself to a job for an entire year, one job. I am decided. I don't understand you, Ramsay. This is not like you. Why not think about it. Talk to Justine. I have to take the next boat to Panama. If you change your mind before that, let me know. Hello dear. How was the party? It looks like they liked it. We read excerpts from the Legend Crepe Along and Cord?lia sang. It looks like they couldn't help it. Did the baby behave well? They played with her so much that she is exhausted and still sleeping. I'm hungry, does Wang have anything to eat? Your favorite dish, roast beef. Great. Why didn't you bring Mr. Wells out to dinner with us? He had a meeting at the hotel, tonight. It's about the land mail contract, isn't it? Aren't you going to the meeting? My no, this has nothing, to do with me The newspaper says that you will be in charge of tracing the route. Oh no. It is more likely to be Hank York. I thought Mr Wells wanted you. We discussed the issue. I thought about not sacrificing a year of my life by eating dust around. Butterfield and Hank can take care of that. Sure honey... you don't want, to shower before dinner? I've already prepared your outfit. Thank you, I want to. I'll be right back. Do you mean that... that I... don't care about that? I couldn't do it. I know how much this means to you. But I promised. I know. And after all, it's only for a year. Um ano Justine!... "TIPTON, MISSIOURI SETEMBER 15, 1858" How are you, John? Hello Harry. I see, everyone sees!... Ormsby of the New York Herald. He goes with you as a correspondent. It's a pleasure, Mr. Ormsby, I hope you enjoyed the trip. I saw everyone sighing. He sends a letter to his newspaper and wants the route. Exactly, of course, come on, for the carriage. You are already well grown. Thanks Very kind of you to come here to say goodbye. We couldn't miss this, could we, dear? I actually came here to ask about Justine. Justine is doing very well. And the baby, how are you? Alice is very well, I should go and see her, Justine misses you very much. Give him my hug. Now, here we are in Tipton, going west across the Rocky Mountains... and wavering through Texas, along Pecos, going... to El Paso and up through Los Angeles, into San Francisco. A distance of 20,600 miles. And how long did it take to prepare, Mr. Butterfield? Just over a year. Amazing. And what can you say about the bus stations? Well, there are about 120 and some of them are... about 20 miles from each other and some even reach 60. Ramsay Mackay can tell you more about this, he oversaw the construction of the majority. By the way, when does the western coach leave? Get out of San Francisco today if we are time, we must meet within ten days. How are you, sir. Hello, Hank. Do you want that, Mr Butterfield? Oh yah ... Stay here. It's ok? You can find more to publish than you think. You are not going with us, are you? Yes Yes. Well, I hope your hair is safe. We're ready, Mr. Butterfield. Ramsay, let's go over there. I'm going up, Sr. Butterfield. Remember, the contract stipulates 25 days cancellation you know, what does this mean for me And for me, too. 25 or total failure. Here we go!... It's already stopped!... Take these!... Change the horses! Come on... Now change them. These are rested, let's go. Well, goodbye guys. Woa, woa, no!... They were Indians, for sure. It must have been completely by surprise. I knew each one well, one of these guys I never thought I was going to bury them. Hyah, come on!... See what's coming. Staff, is the western driver. Woa, guys we arrived, come on!... Let's go dispatch!... Hi, guys, how's work, Ed? Hi, how are you? It's all right. Mr. Butterfield, shake Mr. Slot's hand. How's Mr. Butterfield doing, nice to meet you. Hi!... I didn't expect to find you here. Yeah, two days ahead of schedule, right? Is this a victory, all right with the seasons? Yes, with the exception of number 4, which was completely razed by the Indians. This is bad, all right from our rear... but take it easy through the Old Pass. This will be your job, Ramsay. My? Yes, you will now go on your own. But I don't understand, sir. Well, I'm going back with Ed, I just wanted to relieve Mr. Wells' head. He seemed a little concerned that we weren't able to do it. They are waiting for you in San Francisco, with a great reception. Oh, I'll have mine in Saint Louis, come on, I'm smelling coffee and I'm hungry. Yes, let's go!... Ground Mail is coming. The Mail arriving. So come on now!... Guys, guys, the mail coming. This is an excellent speech by Lincoln. They fight, says they are doing very well in the country. I agree with him, we don't want slavery in California I would like to see you president. Well with this Pony Express both good news and bad news arrive faster. Hyah!... "NOVEMBER, 1860" "FOUND THE EASTERN SECTION OF TELEGRAPH COMPLETED" "AS FOR AS ST. JOSEPH MISSURI"... "THE WESTERN SECTION EXTENDING EAST TO FORT CHURCHILL, NEVADA"... Come on!... But carefully!... Hey Ruff, you have to guide that!... Come on be careful with that!... Go with it fast!... All right, all right!... Lincoln was elected. Lincoln was elected. Lincoln was elected. Lincoln was elected. Lincoln... Lincoln. Well, there is your divided country, even here I didn't know that there were so many Southern sympathizers. Now do you still think that the south will not withdraw from the Union? Mama said in the last letter that if Breckinridge was not elected. I can not believe. This would only represent one thing. Come on!... High there. Woa, high. What is this? You are carrying gold to Washington, the United Confederates of America will take over the shipment. We will give you a legal, refundable receipt at the end of the war. Sergeant. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. President, do you mind receiving, the representative from Wells & Fargo, California No, Mr. Chad, take him inside. I already gave him instructions. The president will welcome you. Mr. President, this is Mr. Mackay. Mr. Mackay. You can immediately understand why these confiscation of gold by the confederation must stop. Yes sir. We do not wan, to continue this war one day longer than is strictly necessary. The south fights in courageous struggle and employs everything to avoid defeat. We have thousands of men on the battlefield who have to be fed... dressed and paid. Every dollar on the San Francisco it is indispensable for this purpose Your company has to bring you here. We will do our best, sir. Thank you, Mr. Mackay. Good morning, Mr. President. Good day. You better wait for me. Yes sir. Hello Ben. Hello, Mr. Mackay. You want to tell Mrs. Pryor that I have a message from Miss Justine. Ah, how is Miss Justine. She's fine, yes thanks. You want to do the favor of waiting there. I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Pryor refuses to receive you. Did I tell her it was Justine who asked me, which is a very important matter? Yes, sir, I told her all this, but she doesn't want to see you The Pryor family took, a big hit with the death of boss Mr. Nick. Nick? Yes, we received the news last week. He was killed there in Georgia. Good afternoon sir. Oh, Ramsay. Mister Pryor, I didn't know, I just heard about death. Yes, Ramsay, our only son, is too hard. I heard you were in Washington. Yes, I was there, I just stopped here on my trip to San Francisco. I'm happy with this, let's sit down. Thanks. But I just arrived with a message from Justine to Mrs. Pryor. Now I understand why she refuses to see me, I... I'm sorry for meddling. It doesn't bother anyone at all. Now give me the message, I'll give it to her. You know. Justine misses you very much. When our baby was born, I know that she regretted not having her mother with her. She hoped that this time we... Adele, my dear, Ramsay was just saying that Justine needs you. If my daughter wants to see me, why not come here, which is her own home. I believe it would be impossible for her to travel in her current state. She wants you to stay with her when the baby. Baby? She asks you to come. When you want to travel. Tomorrow. Very well, I'll be ready. Mom. Why doesn't Dad come and say goodnight. He's busy dear. What are you doing down there with those men? Quiet, go to sleep now. Finally he slept Justine... I came here because you asked, but nothing else holds me here. Now you don't need anyone else, so I'm going home on the next boat. Mom, why? How can you ask me to stay with what has been happening down there Her husband and those men stay in that room all the time. After all, this is his house, but what are they doing? Have you ever wondered why he was called to Washington? And what orders did you receive there? I can't believe that... Because you are afraid to face reality. Afraid to find out now. Are you sure about this new road, Ramsay? Right. This is the biggest shipment we've ever made, over two million gold, right? That's right, sir... Nothing can happen That's why we go further north, into Colorado. We plan to cross the Rocky Mountains near Fort Garland and then go through the valley and take old Harbs' shortcut. Yah thiss will take us from the north of the Arkansas River into Kansas. This looks good to me. Now, as for trains, I think we need... Ramsay... I ask you and friends to get out of here. Make your conspiracies and plans in your office, not in my home. I'm sorry, gentlemen. Well, what was it? You were right. They want to send more gold through the Union army. Yes, to buy more ammunition, more bullets, to kill boys like your own brother. Yes... yes, but we can prevent it. We can stop it, I heard the route they will take. If we can transmit information. And we can, we will find a way. I'm sorry, honey, I didn't know how you felt. I just didn't think, I want to apologize. I'm going to the hotel with Mr. Wells, I'm leaving in the morning, maybe before you wake up Never. Are you going to travel? Yes, I'm going east. You should not. You should not go. Ramsay, because you have to help kill boys who never hurt you. We didn't start this war, the best that we have to do and finish it as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how many are murdered. Just like Nick. I know honey. I would like to finish it this minute. But we have to continue. Besides, I gave my word... Goodbye dear. Ramsay... if you leave now, knowing how I feel. I won't be here when you get back. I can't change my plans... goodbye. Ah!... Tell me what to do!... But anything can happen and there it goes. He takes me he gives me day. And it all ends like this. High. Lieutenant, put two men, with a flag of truce of troops. They are confederates, there is something strange about all this and it was not surprising. It looks like they?re trying to deliberate, Ramsay, they are coming with a white flag Put your weapons down, men. Stay here, Hank. Make a mistake, Captain, we are not an army troop. I'm pretty sure of that, Ramsay. Talbot? You're too far north, aren't you? No, when it comes to business. It must be a very important matter, they are... The gold they are carrying is very important... to the confederate states and I ask that you deliver it. There will be no delivery, I am warning you, we are more numerous. We cannot prevent bloodshed. If they don't attack us. I'm sorry, Ramsay. Me too, Talbot. We will cross, Hank. Wait for me!... Troop attention, get ready for action. Take your seats, boys, we're going in a double row, let's go. Get the knights. Get the knights. Hyah!... Ho!... Any prisoners? Did anyone run away? No, they didn't give up until the end, they fought until the last man. How do you feel, Ramsay. I'm fine. You know, Pawnee died. Do not. It will be weird to be without him around. I found this here at Captain Carter and I thought... that you might want to send to his relatives. Thank you, Hank, let's spend the night here. Make sure they get a decent burial. No doubt. You don't think it's time to come inside, dear. A little more, Mom. I would like you to let go of those thoughts. I should never have abandoned him. Come on, children need you. How's the whiskey, sir? Great. Ah... This is the only thing that hasn't changed, How it feels? Same as always, sir. Except my growing anguish. Yes, increasing. Nicholas... I heard that your son-in-law is in town. Yes, he came to the Nation party... or whatever it is. Have you ever been with him? No... That company has made great strides. Yes. They took control of the Expresso Pac?fico, merged with the company American Express and made Ramsay the vice president. I will be with him tonight at the shareholders' dinner. Grandpa... Mom says it's time to get in. Oh, yes, yes, without a doubt. I'll come tomorrow at the same time, Nicholas. Definitely. We have to finish, this game one day. Yes. Come on, Ramsay. Here he is, mom. Why do you call me whenever I'm winning. Remember that you promised to rest before you leave. Run my son, Mom waits. I would like you to come with me tonight, I don't like to go out without you, it's weird. You know this is impossible. But I thought... that if you could see each other, things could be quite different. Haven't you been writing to him in those days? No, since Mom died. That letter came back, like all the others. I cannot understand. Ramsay did not appear to be of this type. Is there anything you haven't said to me, something you should know? No, Dad, now go change your clothes. So, Justine!... the world has become our oyster through an oyster. Well, the next day, Mr. Bradford lent me the money... that started the ground service from Bufallo to Saint Louis. In the old days we had only one fundamental rule. Get there! I can assure you that Ramsay Mackay... He never broke that rule. There are things about him that can be better... told by his intimate companion of many years. I mean Hank York. I just know that Ramsay and I were already in trouble during our travels, but... that never worried me as much as this suit that I'm wearing. But leaving the jokes aside the old Wells & Fargo company, no doubt fulfilled its part in opening to the west Some people go so far that they say she helped keep the United States together. But now we have trains crossing the country and we also have the telegraph. Now some people think the telegraph is helping, to hold the country together. But I would hate that these United States, only keep it together because of a pile of cables. I think considerable intelligence was needed to come up with even that. Yes, sir, what was done required a lot of intelligence and luck. The lucky part was that Mr. Wells was able to get men, like Ramsay, to put his wonderful ideas into practice. And that's why they thought they weren't doing... enough for him tonight, just feeding... and then they asked me to give him this beautiful gift. It's what they call a plate and it's made of silver... which is made of Constant Load silver and gold from the old Hangtown mine. There where Ramsay organized the first shipment of gold. It shows two hands intertwined, symbolizing the union of east and west. But, you see... I would like to imagine that one hand was mine. And the other was from Ramsay. Because I am terribly proud to have been an inseparable companion... of one of the pioneers of one of the most... I don't think I can talk anymore, I think the collar is tightening too much. Take Ramsay, take the damn thing. You're Alice, aren't you? Yes Dad. I told them who I was and they let me stay here, I hope you don't mind. In no way, am I glad they left. It's... it's hot tonight, isn't it? Excuse me. Can I ask you for something? No thanks. Please sit down. I can't get used to seeing you grown up like that. Let's see, you're 17, right? I'll be... tomorrow. Tomorrow? Don't you remember, do my daddy? It is logical... it is logical. Your birthday. Well... I will have to do something. You could give me a wonderful gift. Tell me, what is it? I'm having a birthday party tomorrow. I came here especially to invite you. Would you come? Well, I... All my friends know that you're here. So, I thought you were able to come. I think you know, I have to leave tomorrow. Well, couldn't you stay an extra day? No, my plans are already made. You do not wanna come? Is not it. Then you will come I'm sorry, i can not. Mom never told me why you guys aren't together... but now I... I never thought you were so cruel. Mr. Mackay? Excuse. Oh, daddy, thanks. Justine. Ramsay. Play. Please play. Glad you came. It made Alice very happy. Dad said he was going back to California. I was going, but... I was wrong Need to talk to you. Those long, empty years of hate and resentment. We have to forget about them, Justine. Yes, Ramsay. So... I want you to destroy this. I should have destroyed it, years ago This was like cancer. Where did you find this. We found it on Talbot Carter's corpse. But I didn't send it. I threw it away, I remember, because Mom was... It was your mother? Oh, but... Justine. Mom? Come on, let's break the cake. This well baby. "THE END"
