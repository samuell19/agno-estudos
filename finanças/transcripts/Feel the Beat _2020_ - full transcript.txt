One moment, ladies. I'll be right back. Ruth Zimmer would like to take a look at you. She's coming in now. [RUTH] Oh, I'm soaked to the bone! [COLLETTE SIGHS] What? That's horrid! [RUTH] Oh, my God. [COLLETTE] What kind of selfish girl would do it to Ruth Zimmer? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] She would. So, you're a really good dancer, are you? I'll bet you're really good. You look like you are. Like you put every hour of every day into sharpening every skill and every move so you can be perfect. But missy, your dreams will never come true, because as long as I live, and I've got a lot of years left, I will make sure that you are never hired for any show, on Broadway, Off-Broadway or Off-Off-Broadway. Your career is over, chorus girl. - Miss Zimmer, please... - Bring back your next choice, Collette. I can explain. - That won't be necessary. - You're done. - Miss Zimmer, please, could you just let... - Let go. Please. - If you just... Please. - Let go of me! - Let me explain. You'll understand. - Let go of me! [SCREAMS] - [CRASH] - [METAL CLANGING] [RUTH] Ow! [GRUNTS] Chorus girl. [KEYS JANGLING] [GASPS] Ooh! Somebody had a good morning. What, Deco? I've had the worst day. I know. I saw it. - What? - Baby girl, you are all over my feed. All over it. [CHUCKLES] What are you talking about? [DISTANT SIREN WAILING] Oh! - [RUTH ON VIDEO] ...is over, chorus girl. - Oh, my gosh... [APRIL ON VIDEO] Let me explain. - [RUTH] Let go of me! - [APRIL] Please! - [CHUCKLES] - [CRASHING] That wasn't my fault. - She slipped and fell. - Yes, and she broke her leg and her wrist. Oh, look. Another person retweeted it to me. How many people have watched this? A couple hundred? Oh, more like 30,000. [CHUCKLES] But who's counting? This can't be happening. She doesn't actually have the power to end my career, right? Just because she's one of the biggest money people on Broadway? Please. [SIGHS] I better call my agent. [DIALING] [CALL RINGING] Hi, this is April, for... [WOMAN] The April who pushed Ruth Zimmer off the stage? - Yes. That April. - [CLICKS] Hello? Hello? They hung up. It was really nice knowing you. I mean, have fun teaching Jazzercise. No. There's gotta be someone who isn't afraid of her. - Someone who'll cast whoever they want. - No, honey. Everybody's afraid of her. Not him. Not Welly Wong. Okay. And without an agent, how do you expect to get in front of Welly Wong? [CAR HORNS BLARING] Nicole, you're saying, "Have auditions," I'm telling you I will. [WELLY] We're looking everywhere. We just haven't found our star yet. ["WORK DAT (SO DAT)" PLAYING] - [WHISPERS] Five, six, seven, eight. - [WELLY] Nicole, I just need to communicate... I'm looking for a specific mix of talent and loveliness. You know what I mean? No! Look harder. ♪ I'm bad with it, I'm dangerous ♪ ♪ I'm bad with it, so dangerous... ♪ - I haven't found my lead dancer yet. - [BIKE BELL CHIMES] [WELLY] Oh, my gosh! David, they're totally on my case about this so it looks like we have to clear a day sometime next week, to find our dancer. We have to find a star, - it's... it's imperative! - [WOMAN] Ow! ♪ Work dat, rip that, hear that, ah ooh ♪ ♪ Watch me, watch me Rip that, rip that, hear that, ah ooh ♪ [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hey, Dad. There she is. What's new? Not much, you know. Just... Paying my dues. It'll happen. You've got the talent, sweetie. Are you... out in the hallway? Yeah, um... I'm just waiting for my takeout. Doing all right otherwise? Do you need anything? No. All good. Oh, but my food's here, so I should probably... Yeah, okay. Call me later, whenever you get a chance. Yeah, I will. Bye. - [SIGHS] - [PHONE DINGS] ["HAND OF MAN" PLAYING] ♪ It's many an hour I've been thinking of our fate... ♪ You heard from Mom lately? Nope. [GROANS] Oh, God. I hope she hasn't seen that video of me. Or people back here either, I would die. Don't get too full of yourself. People around here have other things to worry about. [SCOFFS] Yeah. It's probably just me with a Google alert on you. [APRIL] I hate the Internet. [WHISTLE BLARES] [COACH] All right, boys, let's go, come on. Pick up your feet. - Go Churners. - Great! This rate, we'll be the slowest football team. - RJ, pick up the pace. - I'm trying my best, coach. You too, Goldilocks, come on. - See the team still sucks. - [COACH] ...get home next week. - Buzz. - Pick up your feet! Hey, Frank. How you doing? You call that a run? Let's go. Has anyone moved into your old store? No. Stupid pharmacy chain, putting us little guys out of business. At least they gave you a job. Yeah, part-time but... I really blew it, Dad. Such a failure. [FRANK] Oh, honey. You know what will make you feel better? Cheese. [WOMAN] Thank you, Karen. Say hi to your mom. - Mmm... - April! Oh! [LAUGHS] - Miss Barb. - [BARB] Oh, my gosh! Well, I was just getting snacks for the pep rally. Go Churners! - Go Churners! - And I thought, "Is that April?" But then I go, "Well, that can't be April because April is in NYC." And yet, here you are! Oh, my God! Oh! I just saw Nick. Well, how funny is that? Nick's here? Oh, my gosh. It's just like old times. I mean, you know, minus you two being joined at the lips, [WHISPERS] and before you broke up in that text message. I cannot believe you are standing right in front of me. Oh! You remember my little one, June? Yeah, she was in Pampers the last time that you saw her. Junie. This is who I've been talking about. Yeah, the high school's all-time greatest cheerleader. Go Churners! [ALL] Go Churners! And Mommy's biggest success story. She is a Broadway star! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, you have to come by the studio and say hi to the girls! I would love to. Great! But my dad's been sick. - Who's sick? - Oh, no. Frank, are you sick? - Yeah... - Oh, my God. Well, I'll make you a casserole. That's what I'm gonna do. Okay. Well, it was just so, so wonderful to... see you, and I just... The girls will just... They'll be so disappointed not to meet you, but... I know, it's such a shame. Let's not disappoint the girls. She'll be happy to meet them. [BARB] Really? Oh, well that's fantastic! [CHUCKLES] Oh, my G... Okay, well, you know where the studio is. I'll see you at 5:30. Take care of yourself, Frank. Super. Would it have killed you to play sick? [GASPS] Whoopsie-daisy. Go Churners! [ALL] Go Churners! [WOMAN] Come on, ladies. [NICK] All right. Here we are. Make sure you have everything. Bye! [NICK] Have a good class. Hey, Sarah. Don't forget to help Michelle with her shoes, okay? You don't have to tell me, Nick. See you, guys. Whoo! I bet you don't miss those stairs, huh? Oh! Look, we put your picture on the wall. Honey, don't worry about that right now. The little genius balances my books. But I owe you this shift for my classes this week. [BARB] The receipts can wait. Come on, help me get all the girls together. We have a special guest tonight. You know what? Actually, will you please get a chair for Miss April? - Yes. On it. - [BARB] Mm-hmm. [BARB CHUCKLES] I know I only taught you for eight years, three months and 22 days before you ended up studying in Milwaukee for real. But, you know, I kind of like to think I still had something to do with you becoming a Broadway sensation. [CHUCKLES] Ooh! Speaking of which, let me plant a seed. While you're home visiting, maybe you could teach a master class? Or three? Yeah, let me get back to you... Because I was thinking, for next year, maybe, doing one of these. - A dance competition. - Yes! - Wow! - Yeah! Oh, and you know, this one has a special category called the "Teacher Feature," where the teacher, gets to perform with her students! Isn't that adorable? I mean, of course, this year's first round is this weekend, and even though we've been working on a few routines, we are nowhere near this level or even remotely ready. My dad is in the truck and... Oh, my gosh, Frank! I completely forgot. - I gotta make him a casserole. - Yeah. - We've to get him to bed, don't we? - We do. Okay. So, here we go. Well, just a little quick [BOY IMITATING CAR ENGINE] [SARAH] Michelle, sit still. Sarah? What are you doing here? You look so much older. [SCOFFS] Oh, my goodness. I want you to welcome a very special guest, straight from Broadway, Miss April! [CHEERING] [BOY IMITATING CAR ENGINE] Right. You remember coach Buzz. He leaves his son here while he's at practice. Dicky! Honey. Sh! Sh! Just while his sister's in class. All right. Questions, anyone? Okay. - Ruby. - First off, I made this, and I want you to have it. Second off, I want you to wear it. - [BARB] Well, thank you, Ruby. - [RUBY] Mm-hmm. [BARB] Oh, my goodness, that's just beautiful. Uh, Zuzu. How old were you when you started dancing? - She's deaf? - Mm-hmm. How does she dance on the beat? I feel the vibrations. Um... Kari. How did you get to dance on Broadway? Hard work. Next. - [BARB] Oona. - When they pick people for parts in shows does the most talented dancer always get the part? Nope. Next. Lucia. - What was I gonna say? - Next. - [BARB] Michelle. - How come you're not in any show now? As a matter of fact, um... I just got a part - [BARB GASPS] in this huge Ruth Zimmer show. [OONA] Who's Ruth Zimmer? - What do you play? - What's the show about? - [KARI] Can we see a dance from it? - I wanna be on Broadway. [LUCIA] I wanna be a Broadway star too! - I can't wait till I'm on Broadway. - [APRIL] Okay. You guys wanna know how to get on Broadway? Simple. Never make a mistake in front of anyone important. Ever. [CHUCKLES] But the thing is, you... You don't really know who the important people are. So, really, you can't make a mistake in front of anyone. [SHOUTS] Ever! And nothing can help you. Nothing. Not even your little pig. [PIG SQUEAKS] [INHALES] You manage to pull that off, plus... talent, I'd say you have a solid point zero, zero, zero, zero one percent chance of making it. [APRIL] Any questions? Nope? Great. Well, it's been thrilling, really. Thank you for those inspiring yet realistic words! - [DOOR CLOSES] - [BARB] That was exciting, huh? Hey, look who I ran into. [NICK] The rumors are true. - You're back. - [APRIL] Nick. What are you doing here? My sisters, you know, Sarah and Michelle. Did they wipe your memory while you were in New York? No, I know. But what are you doing back home? [CLICKS TONGUE] Uh... She's back 'cause I'm sick. Oh, I didn't know. [CLEARS THROAT] Neither did I. [COUGHS] [EXHALES] I'm gonna go. - I'm gonna go rest in my truck. - Yeah. Thanks, Dad. So... So... So... So. "So, how are you, Nick?" I'm great. "How you been?" Busy. Yeah, you know, my grandma has been getting a little forgetful. So, I've been taking over more with my sisters, on top of my job, and the classes, you know, just doing the grown-up thing. Oh, by the way, your dad is still on me to, uh, fix the barn from the time we, uh, accidentally started that fire. Since I'm back for a bit, and clearly we're gonna run into each other a lot, I need to say that... [SIGHS] I know I broke your heart when I ended things, not in the most thoughtful way, - and I... - "Sorry to do this in a text, but we have to break up. Ape." See, it was very thoughtfully worded. I just wanna make sure that if, you know, there are any hard feelings - that we can... - Oh, April, April, April, April, April. Did I say something funny? No, no, no. It's just, uh... Look, Ape, that was high school. It's history. Plus, it's not like we were ever gonna last. [INHALES] Well, anyway, I should get back to the books. See you, Frank. That barn isn't gonna fix itself. Well, I guess he's over you. At least his skin's cleared up. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] What's this? I don't know. Some dumb dance competition brochure. She actually asked me to teach. Can you believe that? To teach. - Well, nice. - No. Not nice, Dad. I... I'm not gonna teach what I should be doing myself. I might as well wear a big fat "failure" sign. Ow. You know, this competition doesn't look so dumb. The finals are in Atlantic City with a bunch of muckety-muck judges. "Tony Award winner Marissa Jaret Winokur." You're friends with her, right? I mean, I danced in a benefit she did once. I doubt she has any idea who I am. And that ballet dancer, Nadya Khrist... [MUTTERS] Crazy long last name, and big Broadway guy Willy Wang. - [BRAKES SCREECH] - [FRANK GRUNTS] Welly Wong? [SIGHS] Yeah. - Isn't that what I said? - There's no way. Gimme that. Son of a... [TIRES SCREECHING] And punch. And two, and three, and over your head and five. - I'll do it. - And si... On one condition. We go all the way to Atlantic City. And I'm gonna choreograph a killer Teacher Feature. [CLAPS HANDS] ♪ And round and round and round we go ♪ Welcome to the first day of the DanceDanceDanceDance. Dance Competition Season. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] We're very excited to have you all here today. I'm your host, Burt Davenport. Let me remind you the national titles are in three months in Atlantic City.

It's not about you taking the spotlight. - Attagirl. - Hmm? About time we had some good news around here. [WOMAN 1] Good job, Miss April. [WOMAN 2] Way to go, Miss April. [APRIL GASPS] - You gotta be kidding me. - [BARB] Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! [SCREECHES] Okay. [PANTS] Did they call you? Who? The DanceDanceDanceDance Dance Competition. The Dewey Dance-'Em-All Studio used a ten-year-old in the eight-and-under category. - And I should care because... - You should care because they are disqualified. Which means we came in third. - We... We came in third. - We came in third. - Yeah. We came in third! - We came in third! We came in third! Which means we're gonna go on to the next round! [LAUGHING] Oh! Okay. [BARB] Oh! [BARB GRUNTING] [MIC SCREECHES] Attention, everybody. This is not a drill. The New Hope Dancers are back in the competition! Whoo! Go Churners! [TOWNSPEOPLE] Go Churners! Go Churners. Gosh, I will just die if we get all the way to Nationals and I get to meet Marissa Jaret Winokur. Oh, I saw her in Hairspray ten times. Oh, that beautiful hair, I just wanna nuzzle it and have her sing me to sl... Hi! Kari, do you have that permission slip for the competition? I can just swing by your mom's salon... No. No. Don't do that. I have it. Oh, great! Hey, coach asked me to drop Dicky off. So, here you go. Okay. [SMOOCHES] - [CHUCKLES] - [BARB] Hello, Dicky. - Hi. - How was your day? [DICKY] Good. [BARB] Yeah? Did you have fun? Did you have recess? [DICKY] Yeah. [BARB] Oh, thanks. Okay, ladies. Listen up! Somehow, we're still in this thing. But please, let's not fool ourselves. We still have a lot of work to do. We only need to keep coming third to be in it. How are we gonna do that? Can you explain how we actually advance rounds? AKA, how do we accumulate points? Ruby, honey, it's a weighted average per number. So you've got group numbers, solos... Just do exactly what I say and we'll advance. Got it? Now, before we begin, there are three basic ground rules. Rule number one: Focus! Clearly no one's ever taught you how. No offense, Miss Barb. [CHUCKLES] None taken. So, from now on, anyone who speaks without permission, - drops and gives me 20 push-ups. - [ALL LAUGHING] Yeah, okay. [FALSE LAUGH] I'm not kidding. Number two: Commitment. A dancer without technique is nothing. So, right now, you are nothing. Number three: Do. Exactly what... I... say. Got it? - Got it? - Yes. - Yes, Miss April. - Yes, Miss April. Everyone, take a spot at the barre. Yes, Miss April. Mommy. I already forgot what rule one is. No talking! - Oh, yeah. - Drop and give me 20 push-ups. Now. Yes, Miss April. [WHISPERS] One. - Two. Three. - [APRIL] We have two weeks till Counties. - Four. - [APRIL] Two weeks. Two. Not a lot of time to whip you guys into shape. So, from now on unless you're asleep, or at school you will be here. Practicing, day in and day out. [JUNE] Seventeen. [APRIL] Left hand on the barre. - [JUNE] Twenty. - Miss Barb, count 'em in. [BARB] And side, again the front. And side and back, the side to the front. - Keep going. Side. - Timing. [APRIL] Do it again. [PANTS] Maybe we should take a little break. - They get five minutes at 9:00 p.m. - Okay. Feel the beat. There's no syncopation here. Then where can the sink go on vacation? You. Push-ups. Now. [SIGHS] [JUNE] Yes, Miss April. Let's take it from the glissade piqué. From the top. Today. [BARB] Okay, hustle. Everybody ready? One, two, three, four, five, six, over! - And... - [OONA] My glasses! [APRIL] Stop! [LUCIA] Sorry, Ruby! Eyeballs. Do I have to duct tape those to your face? Fingers. I thought you could feel the beat. So why are you always behind? And... - Pigtails. - Okay. You literally have no idea what you're doing. Don't waste my time and go learn the steps. Go! The rest of you, up on your highest demi-pointe. Close your ribs. Again. [WHISPERS] Again? [APRIL] Today. Okay. Everybody ready? Ready? One, two, three, four, five, six, over! - And up! - Stop! Oh, okay. Stop. Is everyone ready? We're ready. In positions. That's two straight lines. Okay. Everybody hustle. Ready? One, two, three, four, five, six, over! And up! - On your leg. - Over. And up! - [APRIL] On your leg. Get on your leg! - Over. And... [APRIL] Do you hear me yelling at you? Then do it! What is the problem? Maybe it's that we have no idea what you're yelling. If we weren't on our legs, we'd be on our butts! Okay. Okay. All right. Why don't you just - take a moment to explain... - Yeah. How about you try teaching? Instead of leaving us clueless, standing here with our wieners swinging in the breeze. You think you can do better? Well, you're such a crappy teacher, I certainly can't do worse. Get out of my class. Make me. Get out of my class. You get out of my face! I'm done. [HUFFS] Good luck, Miss Barb. - They're hopeless. - I knew you wouldn't stick around. You got something else to say? - Don't be shy, Nail-biter. - [RETCHES] - [KARI RETCHES] - [BARB] Kari... [COUGHING] Where's my crayon? [CELL PHONE RINGS] Woman, you better be calling to apologize. For what? Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I thought you were Mar Jar. - Who? - Marissa Jaret Winokur. Oh, I danced in a benefit she did for Broadway Cares. Well, I loaned that thief these vintage Louboutins for this Tony Award Winners Luncheon, and now she claims she gave 'em back. But why are you calling me? I thought you got banished to, uh... Idaho? Wisconsin. - Oh! - Long story short, this amazing opportunity presented itself to dance in front of Welly Wong. And... - [RUBY SOBBING]That's it. I quit. - Hold on. I'm quitting. [SOBS] [SOBS] Am I really that bad? Uh... Yeah. Oh. I just wanna be good at something. [SOBS] - [RUBY] I'll find something else to do. - I'm just gonna - close this anyway. - [RUBY SOBBING] Thank you, Miss April. You still there? Your maternal instincts are beyond aspirational. [CHUCKLES] [GROANS] [BARB] Okay. Being "on your leg" is kind of like the difference between a banana and a carrot. See? Crooked things can't balance. Aw. But straight things... - [INHALES] Aw! - Aw! Wait. Why didn't she just say that? Oh, you know. Miss April's kinda funny. You know, she always wants to be perfect, and, you know, she was about your age when she decided that she needed to become an amazing dancer. So, she started pushing herself harder, harder, and she forgets that other people aren't as perfect as she is. So, we gotta be real patient with her. - Okay? - Okay. Can I tell you a secret? [WHISPERS] Sometimes I feel like a banana. Mm-hmm. What about you? Are you a banana or a carrot? - A carrot. - [CHUCKLES] I'm so proud of you. Good job. [PANTING] [UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [PANTS] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] - [APRIL] You don't have to stop. - I have to get home anyway. If you connect to your center and you really hold your core, you'll have more control over your body. Super, thanks. And if there's ever anything that you wanna talk about that you maybe can't talk to Nick or your grandma about it. - I've been there, done that, so... - All set. Can I go now? Look, Sarah, I'm just trying to meet you halfway. We're not in class, so I don't have to listen to anything you say. What is your problem? What happened to you? You weren't like this before. Before what? Before you left or before my mom died? No, don't use that as a crutch. - I had to grow up without a mom too. - Did she die? No. No. My mom left me by choice. You wanna unpack that one? Well, like mother, like daughter, I guess. Excuse me? You left without even saying goodbye. Sarah, people live their own lives. Get used to it. Besides, it's not like I was dating you. Right. Then I'd at least have gotten a text message. But who cares about the dumb little sister anyway? There's got to have been a thousand people that auditioned before me. I've been waiting to audition for the new Welly Wong show "Whirly Girl," and I'm almost at the front. I hope I get a callback. [TRUCK APPROACHING] [TRUCK DOOR SLAMS] [NICK] Hey! - What are you doing down there? - Looking for my phone. It's in your hand. Yes, that's 'cause I already found it. Obviously. [APRIL] Um, so what are you doing here? Oh, you know, not much. I was just working down the street when I saw Grandma drive by in my truck. Hey, Grams! [YELLS] Oh, Nicky! Technically, she's not allowed to drive anymore but she loves this merry-go-round. So... Sarah told me you guys had a fun class last night. Oh, yeah. It was a barrel of laughs. I mean, I'm trying to help her, but it's like a brick wall. That doesn't sound right. - Really? - Yeah, you trying to help someone? Ha ha. Very funny. Hey, look, she's not gonna put out the welcome mat just 'cause you're back. You know, you're the reason she started dancing. You were her lifeline and then poof. You know, if you really wanna help her, try remembering what it was like when you were in her shoes. You know, when you were all moody and wearing flannel. - That never happened. - Pictures don't lie. No, I have no recollection. - [LAUGHS] Oh, okay. - Mm-hmm. Rehearsals can get intense. It's part of the job. [SARAH] Duh, that's why Ruby quit. Moving on. Dude, you walked out after one class. We're just kids. We don't learn as fast as you professionals. And what about rule number two? Commitment? [SIGHS] Point taken. If you promise to do what I tell you. And curtail the attitude, I promise to honor my commitment, and see it through to the end. Deal? Well, what do you guys want to do? I mean... I want to keep competing. - Me too. - Me too. [SIGHS] But I don't want to do it with her. - Me too. - Me too. Well, yeah, but she's the only one good enough to get us there. So, do we have a deal? Deal. Okay. Let's start with the barre, because we've got a lot to do in two weeks. First position. Fifth position. There it is. That's a nice port de bras. See that? [JUNE] I can't see anything. Twenty. [GROANS] Fourth position. Again. Step battement. Battement. Side. Back. Step battement. Front. [WHISPERS] All right, listen. I'll see you tonight, okay? Be good. - Side. - [DICKY] Bye, Dad. - Zuzu, I love you. - Coach! - This is not free daycare. - All right. [APRIL] First position. Fifth position. Fifth position. - [APRIL] Fourth position. - Fourth position. [APRIL] Again. What is this? What is this? Noodle arms. You might as well just wave goodbye to Nationals. Wave goodbye. Bye. Turn, turn, turn. [LUCIA] My glasses! You have to spot. That's why you're dizzy. Again. Prepare. Pirouette. And turn. Turn, turn, turn, turn. Fingers. Sarah. That's exactly why you're in the back. How many times do I have to say this? You have to practice at home. Again. Prepare. No, sweetheart. Okay, it's close. It's three, four, head roll, contract, pas de bourrée. Five, six, ready to turn, one! Step two, and two. And three. Hip! [SIGHS] Contract, pas de bourrée. You good? Beautiful. [KARI'S MOM] Hi, honey. What are you doing in the dark? Nothing. Just homework. Put on a light. And get to bed soon. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Spotting will keep you from getting dizzy. [GRUNTS] Spot the faces. - [BLOWS] - [APRIL] Ready, girls? Take it away. Red face. Red face. Red face. Red face. Again. Green face. Green face. Green face. [FEET SKID] [APRIL] Blue face! Blue face.

[BARB] Three, four, five and six, - seven, eight. - Shoulders, it's not just about doing the moves. You have to sell it. - [BARB] Seven, eight. - Stop! Shoulders, get to the back. - You heard me. - [SCOFFS] Fingers. Go to the front. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. That's my girl. That's 20, Coach. - Sorry, Miss April, I'll do right here. - Make it 40. [BUZZ] Yeah. Sorry, okay. Two. [WOOD CREAKING] [APRIL] Again! And there's five, six, seven, eight. Hands on hips, here we go.

You know, not that any of this is how I pictured my life would be. [APRIL LAUGHS] Yeah. Welcome to the club. Oh, please. You were dancing on Broadway. I'd say your life turned out exactly how you thought it would. You know, Nick... um... Even if your life isn't entirely what you pictured, I do really admire what you did. Dropping your life - to take care of your sister... - I didn't, you know, "drop" my life. You know, you do what you have to. What you think is right. No, I know. [LAUGHS] That's just what you do. - I just mean that I... - No, I know. It's not... It's not exactly the big plan we came up with. Running away to New York together. No. It's not. You now, Ape, uh after, "The Text..." I went to New York, and then I saw you. What? You were coming out of your rehearsal on 46th Street. And you had never looked happier. And then I knew. I had to let you go. [LAUGHS] You know, we... We wouldn't have worked out for a million reasons. Yeah. No. But... I bet it would have been fun to try. Well, I should probably get to it. Yeah. No, me too. [BUZZ] Nine, eight, seven! Set! [WHISTLE BLOWS] Okay gentlemen, really drive those legs, okay? - Push this thing. - [APRIL] Listen up, ladies.

Kari, get your things. - Patty, please. - No, Barb. I don't appreciate you going behind my back. I'm sorry, but I... I thought you knew. I didn't. Come on, Kari. Kari, honey. You gotta go with your mom. Let's go! Now! No, Mom. I'm not going. We discussed this. I'm doing the best I can while Daddy's deployed, but we can't afford dance right now. And we don't take charity.

I have to run back to take care of an emergency but can I steal you away for a moment? I have a proposition for you. Yes, of course. Um... I will catch up with you guys. [BARB] Okay, all right, well, notes in the dressing room, everybody. Come on. This couldn't have worked out more perfectly, right? April? Hey. I was just coming to find you, um... Where are you going? I'm, uh... I'm headed back to New York. What? Welly Wong offered me a part in his new show. The lead. And I have to be at rehearsals now. Welly's been called back. Oh, what about finals? They're tomorrow. I'll tell him you'll be right out. [WHISPERS] Yeah. Thanks. [SCOFFS] So, you're just ditching us? But this whole thing was your idea. You made a commitment. I know. But what am I supposed to do? Sarah, I've dreamt of this my whole life. So, I'm going. [SCOFFS] That was the plan the whole time, wasn't it? You just wanted to use the stupid little girls so you could claw your way back to Broadway. I knew it. I knew it the whole time. You're just a selfish jerk! [SCOFFS] Okay, you don't care about anyone but yourself! You're just leaving me again! [SARAH CRYING] Good luck tomorrow. [SOBBING] April... April, wait! April! Wait! Wait! Please. Please don't go. - Please. - You don't need me. You're gonna be great. - I promise. - [SOBS] Please. - I'm sorry. - No, please, don't... [NICK] Hey! April! April!

[FRANK SIGHS] Well, sweetheart, you've been busting your ass at this for quite a long time. I mean, I finally got my dream. It's the perfect show. The perfect role. I don't know, I just... I thought I'd be happier. Yeah. That's the problem with being a perfectionist. Nothing's ever good enough. You know, I keep telling myself. I'm a dancer. This is what I'm supposed to do. Says who? You do what your gut tells you to do. And if there's any part of you that thinks that making a big splash on Broadway is suddenly gonna bring your mom back, you can forget about that. There's nothing you can do to bring her back. Because it wasn't your fault that she left in the first place. She just left. So, whatever you decide, just make sure that it makes you feel good about who you are. I mean it's what I've always wanted to be. I'd be stupid not to. I didn't say "what you are," I said "who." And I can think of nine little reasons why it wouldn't be so stupid. [CAR HORNS BLARING] Hey, everybody. We'll start scene work in five minutes. Top of the second act. Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong. I'm sorry, Mr. Wong, but I have to go back to the competition. If that means that you have to give my part to someone else, I understand. I mean, I don't want you to, because I think you need someone who honors their commitments. And you see, that's exactly why I have to go, because... I have nine little kids that I committed to. You know, I have a whole town that's counting on me. So, I have to go. What the... When do they go on? They're in the first group after lunch, - but I can't find them. - Okay, I'm on my way back. - You'll never make it in time! - Get them ready. I'll be there. Promise! Ruby, - find them. - On it. You couldn't have asked to borrow his limo? Just admit it. You love me. - [DECO] You owe me gas money. - [APRIL] To Atlantic City! [OVER PA] Hi, I'm Burt Davenport, and we continue on with day two of our competition! - Next up, number 44. - Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. - [BURT] Large group production number. - Gosh. The New Hope Dance Studio. [TIRES SCREECH] - Okay? - Okay? - [APRIL] Goodbye, yep! - Go! Run! You can make it! Go! - [BURT] This is the final countdown... - Excuse me, coming through. [BURT] ...for the New Hope Dance Studio. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God! - We're at our countdown. - Okay. Okay. They should be... Oh, no. - Where are they? - I don't know. I don't know. I was panicking. I said to Ruby, I was like, "Find them," but I wasn't... I didn't specifically say like, "Bring them stage left." I... [RUBY] Everybody, get ready. Hurry, we are in our final countdown. [BARB PANTING] What's she doing here? Yeah, I wonder who's in the audience this time? What happened to your amazing job? Well, they probably fired her. Again. Look, you have every right to hate me, but you earned this. You deserve to be here. So, please don't sit out on this just because you wanna get back at me. When I first met you, all I saw were flaws. And then I realized, that's exactly what makes you spectacular. All those beautiful quirks and imperfections. And I'm so sorry that I left. [APRIL] It just... It took me a second to realize that we've become family. What's wrong with you? How come you're not yelling at us? I want you to know how proud I am of all of you. You've all become the most beautiful dancers. You're scaring me. - Michelle... - [BURT] New Hope. Dance Studio, last call. You have one minute to be on stage or you will be disqualified. Disgusted. I'm disgusted by all this whimpering self-pity. Now, this is not how I trained you. So, put on your big-girl pants. You too, Dicky. You get on that stage, or else. You have till the count of five. One. Oh, you thought I was being tough on you before. Oh, no, I was just getting started. - Two! - Jackets. Okay. Give me your jackets. Jackets! Yeah, that's what I thought. Three!

What did I tell you? - You have to hold it away from your face. - Sorry. - I'm just gonna see every pore. - Okay, well... Listen, I got some bad news. That barn's roof is leaking. I mean, so much worse than my studio. - Well, I asked Nick to repair it and... - Whoa, hold on. Okay, in my defense, I said we should replace, not repair. Well, anyway, we canceled class. Okay, bye. Hang on. Hang on. That's not the agreement. I teach class over FaceTime. They do what I say. I fly back every Sunday. They do what I say. - Okay. But... - And what I say is, I don't really care if there's three feet of water and they have to swim. Mm-hmm. They show up to class. [BARB] I know. We gotta beat the Royaltons next year. Well, I'll get them all together and call you when I have them. Okay. - Bye. - [KNOCKING] Come in. Oh, Mr. Wong. Hi. I have some notes. A couple tweaks. But it didn't suck. [EXHALES] Thank you. Oh, before I forget, they said somebody's waiting for you in the theater. [CHEERING] What are you guys doing here? Well, you asked me to get everyone together. [STAMMERS] How did you guys afford this? [WELLY] Discussion for later. I will call you next week. Improve your listening skills. I said I'd call you next week. So, what are we gonna do now?
