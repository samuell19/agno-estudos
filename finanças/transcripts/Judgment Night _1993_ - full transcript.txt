Hey, you. Hey, why don't you call Peggy? 'She can come over and watch TV with you.' That, uh, that show that you like is on tonight, isn't it? Hey. Hey, cutie. What's the name of it, um.. Oh, come on, Linda. You're makin' me feel very guilty here. Look, it-it's just gonna be for a couple of hours. I deserve this, you know, I haven't been out of the house for over three months. Three months. Gee, that's probably exactly how long it's been since I've been out. Looks like Mike almost has his date for tonight. Linda. Nobody is taking dates. It's a bunch of guys goin' to a boxing match. That's it. What? Wh-why are you lookin' at me like that? 'Cause I know your friends. They have the hormones of high school kids. Don't start accusing me of runnin' around... You're the only one of your friends who has a family. You know, I think it's time we start hangin' out with grown-ups. My friends are grown-ups. Oh, sorry. 'If you look out the starboard side..' What the hell is that? '...potentially very dangerous' 'Mr. Frank Wyatt.' 'Not since the turn of the century' 'has he come out to vacation with us.' 'Let's dust him off and give him a good round of applause.' Here's one of your grown-up friends now. I gotta go. Go. Go and have some fun. Maybe you'll stop walking around with that look on your face. Say bye. I have no regrets. Okay? Whatever you say. Bye, gorgeous. Daddy's gotta go. I love you. 'Oh, excuse me.' I love you too. 'We've got some, uh, family values exhibition..' I'll be home early, okay? Yeah, Linda, say around, uh, 8 a.m. - Oh. - Thanks. I'm on the couch tonight for sure. Well, that's simple, Frank. She hates me. She does not hate you. I've been married to that woman for two years. Remember your birthday? Hm? She hates you. - Hey. - Hey. Linda? Let me get rid of these bums. 'I'll be right back to get on you.' - Promise? - Check it out inside. It's bigger than your house. Whoo! Prepare to have your pleasure glands carpet bombed. Watch out for the floors 'cause they're marble. Oh. - You guys. - Wow. Whoo. - Cool system, man. - Thanks. Don't, uh, touch anything. Okay? That's not right for you. And don't put your dirty dogs on my clean upholstery either. Ray, where the hell did you get this thing? - I promoted it. - You what? I conned the dealer into letting me take it out for the evening. Well, how did you do that? Well, I was driving past the dealership and I spotted this beast, and I was thinking about this evening, so I go inside and say "This baby is perfect for entertaining clients "and I'm thinking about using it to buy a few of them for my sales force." At which time he got on his hands and knees and began begging me to take it out. - It was embarrassing. - No, wait-wait-wait. - Your sales force, Ray? - Mm-hm. I may have some and I will. Tomorrow I'll return it and I'll say "Thank you very much, sir but under very "very careful consideration I would have to say "it's not big enough. "I need a driver's side air bag in the bathroom and, uh, I'll see ya." Ray Cochran. 'The man, the myth.' Yes, indeed. Listen, we're running late. Where's Eddie? Eddie couldn't make it. He canceled the last minute. So I, uh, invited someone else. Who'd you invite? Hey, no, whoa, whoa. 'Hey, easy, hey, hey!' 'Who's the crash-test dummy?' That's your little brother. Ray. Don't start. Linda's been bustin' my balls since I got home, alright? Give him a break, man, 'cause John's a good guy, bro. He's a good.. He's a pain in the ass. Every time you guys get together man, it's like a slugfest. - 'That's not true.' - 'It's not true?' 'So, he doesn't piss you off every time you get together?' Ray, he's my brother and I invited him, okay? 'Hey, Razor-man.' That's cool. It's nice. - What the hell is this thing? - You just, get in. Looks like Barbie's playhouse. 'You should know, you're the one who plays with dolls.' - Mike. - What's up? Where you been, buddy? Jesus. Look at this thing. Yo, bro. My big brother actually invites me to go somewhere, huh? You sick or somethin', Frank? You're late, as usual. What do ya say fight fans? Crack open some tasty libations and let's get on the road. Beers are in the fridge, John. Ooh, beer. 'Okay, let's hit it. All aboard?' 'Ray, Ray, that's a conductor, not a bus driver.' 'Why don't you sit down and shut up?' 'Now, that's a bus driver.' 'Alright, let me see your transfer, man.' 'When has any of you ever been on a bus?' 'Let me tell you somethin, ' I've seen a few.' 'Yeah, alright. I got 600 on Davis.' 'What? You idiot!' 'You know, Davis rhymes with "Save us!"' 'You should've given the money to us.' 'We should've left earlier. We're gonna miss the prelim.' 'Hey, the Razor-man will not be letting you down.' 'I don't intend to miss one single solitary punch.' 'Where did this kid come from?' What's he doing? He needs to bob and weave. Look at that. Thank God, this thing has a satellite dish, right? 'Oh, shit.' Much better than sitting ringside, Ray. Much, much better. 'Another day in front of the boob tube.' 'We're gonna be so close we may get a little blood on us.' 'It'll be comin' out of our noses' 'our seats'll be so high in the rafters.' 'Give me a break.' 'Oh, shit.' 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.' Look at him. Look at him go. - Hit him! - Hit him! Hell, yeah, look at him go, man. That's it. See his feet. His legs are bucklin'. It's over. 'His manager's outside bettin' on the other guy.' Hernandez and that, uh, Martinez kid won't last three rounds. We're gonna miss the main event. Yeah, Mike's right. We should just settle in and... Bullshit. We're not gonna miss anything. Just shut that TV off. Hey, Ray. Take it easy. Do you wanna make it to the fight on time or not? Hm? Alright. 'It's a battle between the number two' 'and number three middleweights in the world.' 'Mickey Mad Dog Davis... ' Piece of shit. 'Whoa. What are you doin'?' I don't believe this punk. He's not gonna let me in. Hey. Hey, how about it, huh? - Can we get in? - How about what? Can we get over? Why don't you wait your turn like everyone else, asshole. Hey, John, forget it. You wanna let us over? 'No way, man. No way.' Ray, this guy's not stopping. Back off already. - I'm not gonna back off. - No. What are you doing? Ray, back off, man. He's not stopping. 'Hey, look out!' 'Oh-ho!' Oh, this guy just hit me. He just hit me. 'I don't believe this guy hit me.' Fuck you! What are you doing? - Hey, fuck you! You want some? - Fuck you. I'm coming over. 'Ding, ding, ding! Round one!' Yeah, come on, let's see something, little fucking weasel. - Let's see what you got. - Get off me, Frank. Get off! - Not tonight, man. - I didn't think so. 'Let me go, Frank, I can take this motherfucker. Come on!' - What? - Come on. - Fuck you. - Come on, John-boy. I'll beat the shit out of both of you. - Back off. - Hey, what's this? What are you.. Ah! Huh? Don't. Hey, it hurts, huh? Hey! Leave him alone. Yeah, relax and take the pretty girl home. Unless you want me to. Huh? I can't hear you. I'm sorry, what? Ah! Yeah, alright. Come on, buddy. 'Just get in the car.' You're not worth it. Nice job, buddy. Shut up, man! 'Way to go, tough guy!' I can't believe people in this fucking town. Calm down, honey. Married life making you soft, Frank? I remember when your brother would have dumped that guy on his ass. Yeah. What the hell is the matter with you, huh? You can't get into it with every asshole that looks at you funny. John, there's a lot of craziness going on out there. You never know what maniac is gonna pull out a gun and blow your goddamn brains out. It happens every day in this city. Hey, you listen to me! What, Frank? What are you gonna do? You're not my father, Frank. Way to go, little man. You showed some heart. Hey. What did I say? Huh? What did I tell you? - Do you remember what I said? - I know. I'm sorry. Don't encourage him with that macho shit. I'm sorry, Frank. You know, but he's right, you know. What are you talking about? You're not his father, bro. That was really smart, baby brother. Hey, enough, Ray. Alright? Well, stop acting like you're three. Why do you always have to say shit like that? Hey, hey! Let's knock it off! I wanna have a good fucking time tonight, alright? Everybody hold on to something. We're getting out of here. What the hell are you doing? Let me tell you something, I'm not gonna miss this fight. I hate being late. Wait, the cops! I'm joking, Ray. - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! 'Ray's the man! Do it. Do it!' Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! 'Let me tell you something right now, here is to me' 'and those like me.' 'There's very few of them left remaining.' 'Thank God.' 'Yes, this is an extraordinary' 'piece of navigation, my brother.' - 'Thank you, my friend.' - 'Any ideas how to get there?' 'Of course, I do. Double back around the expressway.' 'How hard can it be?' Whoo-oo-oo-oo! I bet there's some tremendous real estate bargains down here. Yeah, well, that's great, Ray but where's the damn expressway, huh? Yeah, enough of this scenic route. 'The guys that built the expressway did it logically.' We hit the next major intersection and cut over. 'Well, I-I don't see any signs or anything there, Ray.' 'I'm gonna be, if I can cross over' 'the one-way street that we exited on, we'll be fine.' 'We've been around this block a thousand times.' 'I don't care if we have.' 'We gotta cross the one-way street. We'll be fine.' 'We don't know where we are.' We're lost. 'You have no clue where you're going.' 'Little faith, my friends. We have never been here.' 'Oh, look at that. The Brothers Johnson.' Hey, look, Ray, I'm just being logical, right? When you're lost, you ask for directions. So let's ask those guys. 'They look like they know their way around.' Sure. We'll tell them we're the Welcome Wagon and we have some baked goods for them.. Right on. Excuse me! Gentlemen! 'Hi. We're the Welcome Wagon.' Can you come here for a minute, please? Uh, Mr. Welcome, here would like to ask you something. Give me that. You know what? It's not funny. Ooh, here they come, Ray. They're having a party, baby! How are you? Show them, man. Show them what you got. - Check it out, man. Show them. - Watch this. Oh, shit. 'Ray, what the hell are you doing?' Let him have it, Earl. How is that funny? Can you teJl me? Because I don't get it. Tell me why that's funny. Just get us back on the expressway. Jesus. - 'Good bye.' - Lock your doors. 'You got the gun. Anybody comes, we'll blow them away.' 'Hey, look, just lock the doors.' 'I'll lock the goddamn door.' 'I don't even know if I'm insured on this thing.' You think I'm insured? - Whoa, wait. - What? You really know how to use this thing, there, Razor? That's a Beretta 9mm. Shit happens, man. Hey, you were right, Frank. You never know what maniac's gonna pull out a gun. Come on, the only maniac I know is you. Hey, you know what we need? We need a frigging map. Who carries a map? Thousands of unarmed people who drive Hyundais carry maps, Ray. 'Now, how about getting us out of here?' It's not my ride but I think there's a map in the glove compartment. 'Right here?' No, right to the right of it. Right. Here it is. You're a little closer than I am. Whoa, hey, hey! - Who? - What was that? 'I don't know, I think we hit something.' Uh, maybe a dog or something. No, we didn't. Ray. I felt it. I think we hit someone. Do you know where the hell we are? They're scam artists, okay? Now, they make a living doing this. Doing what, Ray? They run out into the middle of the street and they pretend to get hit and they blow your head off. Somebody might be hurt, Ray. 'Frank, what are you doing?' I'm gonna check it out. What are you.. Frank? Come on, you guys doing the Mother Teresa Show? Wait. Hey.. Nothing down here. He's dead. Think again, asshole. - Shit. - Hey, be careful. 'Don't move.' It's gonna be alright. What's happening? We hit somebody! Call 911! Oh, my God, I don't believe it. Ow. '911 emergency.' How long did they say it was gonna be? The phone's dead, man. There's no service in this shithole part of town. Hey, we gotta get him to an emergency room. How do you work this, Ray? I didn't see him, man. He came out of nowhere. You know, I never, it wasn't my fault. Hey. 'Bring him into the RV.' - Come on. - Alright. Is he okay? Hear me out a second.. Move. - Easy, easy, easy, easy. - Careful. Careful. Alright. Easy, easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Be careful, be careful. Ray, get a towel. 'He's been shot.' Put this under his head. Be careful. Easy. Easy. Hey, hey, hey. 'It's alright.' He's a thief, man. The cops probably shot him. They'll be back any minute. What happened, kid? Who shot you? Hey, come on, leave him alone. Goddamn it, somebody shot him, okay? We could all be in danger. Ray, we're not just gonna leave him here. Look, I've had a lot to drink tonight, okay? Hey, man, what's your problem? The kid is hurt. Look, do you want me to go to prison because of this punk? - It is not our concern. - Yes, it is, Ray. Look, they're coming after me. You gotta help me. Look, we won't let anybody hurt you. Look, you gotta get me out of here! Shut up! Goddamn it! I can't hear myself think! 'Ray, you shut up!' Who the hell are you telling to shut up? No, wait, wait, wait. Listen. 'Y-y-you can't tell them about the money.' 'Don't worry, don't worry. We'll catch them, man.' 'It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay.' 'Look, that's not what I'm worried about.' There they go! Right there! - They didn't see us. - Ray, we gotta catch them! I just think we should figure this thing out... If you're not gonna drive, I will. 'I'll get the door. Let's go!' Ray, get out of the way. There they go. Hey! Help! Police! Help! We got somebody shot! 'Hey!' They turned the corner. Hey! SOS! Hey! 'Hey, we got a wounded kid!' Frank! Frank, take it easy! Where the hell are they? Fuck! Where did they go? 'Whow-whoa!' Ray, you okay? - Ray? - Yeah. I'm alright. You alright, Frank? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What the hell hit us? - I don't believe it. - My guess? Probably some no-insurance, car-driving asshole bashed into us in a fucking junker. - Un-fucking-believable. - Ray, calm down. Calm down? This stuff's gonna cost me a fortune. I'm just now the proud owner of a nice little fax machine. Gonna fax myself. Might be nice for me later on, and a big large-screen.. Huh? Brand-new piece of shit TV. This'll be mine. - 'Alright.' - You okay, brother? - 'Yeah, I'm fine.' - Huh? ...is gonna cost me right here? Uh. We're stuck... in here. We're stuck, okay? We're stuck in this piece of shit which I now own, okay? This piece of fucking shit! - Ray! - Ray! Ray, calm down! Hey, Ray. 'Why don't you try and start this thing?' Fuck, get a window open or something. 'Damn thing's stuck.' Great. Wonderful. It's dead. We're not going anywhere. They're out there. Who? Who are you talking about? Who's out there? You guys don't know what you're messing with. - We gotta get out of here! - Hey, shut up! - We gotta get out... - We're doing the best we can. No, wait, quiet. You hear that? I'm gonna take a look around. No, don't do that. They'll blow your head off. Ray, get the gun. 'Get the fucking gun, Ray.' It's gone. - What? - It fell out when we hit. - Well, try and find it. - It's gotta be around here. - 'Hope so.' - 'Look it, man.' 'You see anything?' Nothing. It seems okay. I think we can all squeeze through there and... What up, Teddy? Playing a little hide and seek? Come on out, come on. Come here, motherfucker. Back the fuck off. Ladies. You wanna get tough with me, kid? You wanna keep him? Huh? Back off, kid. You ain't got no balls. Now, you children sit tight and no one'll get hurt, okay? Crack a window. You okay? This thing isn't working. I thought you said there was no service. Look.. ...Sykes. Look, no. - You know... - Shh, shh. Come on, man, this is crazy. Sykes, you know me. 'You see, Teddy, the problem is..' 'No, no, no problem, man.' You broke one of his rules. It's not like that, man. Look, I didn't do anything. All you gotta do is tell Fallon. That's all I'm asking you to do. - Tell Fallon what? - Well, go ahead. Tell him. Fallon, look it's not what you think, man. I-I wasn't wrong-running. I mean, you got it wrong. I got all the money right there. You-you can just keep it. You can count it. How could you steal from me, Teddy? I-I wasn't stealing from you, man. It's right there. All the money, man. The only thing I hate worse than a thief is a liar, Teddy. You broke rule number one, do not steal from me. What you thinking about, Teddy? Look, come on, we grew up, man... All you had to do was keep the merchandise moving. What was the problem, huh? No company car? Not long enough lunches? What, Teddy? We can't just sit here. We're not gonna do anything, Frank? - We're not gonna do one thing? - Shh, come on, hey. What? What do you want us to do, man? Did you mention my name to the guys in the truck? Did you mention my name to the guys in the truck? I didn't say anything! Why the fuck would I say anything? I wouldn't rat you out, man! I wouldn't say shit! So, what do you want me to do? Want me to let you go? Is that what you want? I let you go. And then I'm supposed to conduct business on the street? Who? Who? Who's gonna know, right? I mean, who? Nobody's gonna tell them. 'He's not gonna tell and I'm not gonna... ' - That's right. - No! Come on, man! All you gotta do is... You know, we got another problem. How many guys in the truck? About four. North Shore plates too. Great. Just great. Well, boys, rule number two, no witnesses. Come on! We're gonna be next. 'Come on!' 'Come on, Ray, come on!' What the hell are you doing? 'Come on!' Oh, shit. 'Come on! Fuck it! Come on, Ray!' Where do these guys think they're going? 'Come on, Ray!' Come on, Ray. Shit. Oh! Sorry, man. That's not exactly what I had in mind. Thanks. That's what I'll tell the dealer. Yeah, you won't be telling the dealer nothing unless we get the fuck outta here. 'Come on!' 'That was great, guys. Do it again.' - That's not funny. - Hey, man, that was funny. Shit looks like the Hindenburg, man. 'Come on.' Let's go. Let's go, Ray. Stop. Where're we headed? John? You alright? Why? Why'd they do it? They killed him, Frank. They killed him. Hey, I don't think they're gonna follow us, man. They won't do that. We saw 'em shoot that kid, Ray. We were witnesses. Where the hell are we? Huh? Why'd you get off the expressway, Ray? Oh, are we at the blaming stage now, huh? I don't remember twisting your arm to get off the expressway. - Go. - Go. Hey! Forget it, Mike. Come on. Come on. Come on, Mike, come on. Frank. Frank. Did they see us? I don't know. I don't think so. 'Frank was right.' They do want to kill us. I never said they wanted to kill us. - What are we gonna do? - Shut up. Well.. Look what the cat drug in. 'Keep your voice down.' Hello, ladies. What do you think of the neighborhood? We call these condos down here. 'Nice, huh?' 'It could be just like one of those' 'North Shore suburbs though, huh?' 'Guess what, I knew you guys'd go straight for the rail yard.' 'But you didn't pass "Go"' 'so you definitely don't get the 200 bucks.' 'You just sit tight' "cause I'm gonna come door to door' 'like the goddamn Avon Lady.' And by the way... you fucked up my car. And I don't have collision. 'The guy out there sounds like he wants to' do you... bodily harm or something. I'm a college graduate. 'That's Buck.' He's got the brain of a chicken. Sure would be a shame if he was to hear you in here. 'Damn shame.' He'd, he'd shoot us and then blow your heads off. I don't think so. He might even be grateful. Might give us a reward. Alright. Alright, goddamn it. 'Name your price.' Gee, Mister Businessman. What did you have in mind? 'Don't move.' 'Don't whisper.' Don't even breathe. Don't you hate it.. ...when you try to be quiet.. ...and every sound seems to be amplified 20 or 30 times? 'What is that?' What's that smell? You guys wearing cologne? Or is that... fear? - 'Nice watch.' - Go to hell. Already there, man. Ray, give it to him. Lucy! I'm home! You got some explaining to do! Don't touch me. Don't be stupid, John. Alright. It's all I got. You guys are really starting to piss me off! This is eating into my drinking time! But I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. Since I'm such a nice person and so in touch with my inner child 'I'm gonna give you a chance.' 'Come out, forget about the bullshit' 'and we'll discuss this.' 'I'm gonna count to three.' One... Mississippi. Two... Mississippi. Alright! Opportunity knocked and you failed to answer. Don't say I didn't give you a chance. 'Come on! Let's talk.' 'Let's mingle.' Alright. 'Now... I'm getting mad.' This one's locked up too, man. You know, it's possible they didn't even stop here. They just took right off. It just doesn't feel right, you know? I'm a college graduate. 'I used to play college ball.' I ain't got my jacket no more. That's too bad. Somebody stole it. And, you know I, I had, I had great hands, man. I mean, you should have seen me. "Go out wide, Buck!" Hey, take it easy. I'm going wide. I'm going wide, man. Yeah, I could've been Walter Payton. This guy played too many games with no helmet. What, you think I'm funny or something, man, huh? Who do you think you are, coming down here wearing that jacket and calling me a liar? 'Cause I'm a goddamn college graduate! What the hell do I gotta do to shut him up? Come on, let's get outta here. - Come on, man, move it. - Take out time, boys. 'That white guy's got a gun!' Shit, hobo from Purdue. I hate Purdue. When's the last time they ever won anything, anyways? 'Mm, plastic.' 'That's one of 'em.' Bums must've rolled 'em, huh? Welcome to the neighborhood, boys. 'There they are! Come on!' Come on, maybe we can outrun them. This way, come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Hold it. Shh. Go, go! Let's go! Look, Frank. Listen. I can't fucking keep up, okay? - You have to. - Listen to me. Don't leave my ass down here, okay? This is hell. You can do this, man. You can do this. If you take care of me, I'll give you anything you want. All I want is for you to move your ass. We're gonna make it, man. All of us. - Oh. - Okay? - Alright. - I think we lost 'em. - Hey, you okay? Huh? - Yeah, I'm alright. Where, where are the cops, man? Someone must have heard the blast. Yeah, well, you could dynamite a whole city block they wouldn't come. - That's criminal. - Hey, look at this. Oh, yeah. Oh. Reach out and touch someone my ass, huh? Great. Hey, wait, there's lights on in that building up there. Let's go get some help. Come on. Come on. Come on, Ray. Goddamn, I tore my jacket. I'd be more worried about my ass, not my jacket. Yeah, well, my ass doesn't cost $450. Alright, if anything happens, don't think, just run, okay? We gotta find someone who'll let us use their phone. You really think one of these freaks are gonna let us use their phone? These "Freaks" are our neighbors, Ray. - They're not my neighbors, man. - Oh, yeah? I bet we haven't been more than 10 miles from your front door this whole night. What's up with that noise? We should go talk to him. No, no, no. I got a better idea. Mike! There's a way in over there. Hi, sir. Um, I need to use your phone. - No. No, no, no, no. - Just one phone call. - 'No, no. No way!' - Thanks a lot. Mike, take it easy, man. You, too, buddy. - Hello? Anybody home? - Who does he think he is? What's wrong with these people? They're just like you, Ray. - How is that? - They're scared. They won't even talk to us. - Hi. How are you? - What do you want? - Can we use your phone, please? - Hey, hey. Nobody's gonna help us. Nobody. Welcome to the real world, Ray. This is it. If you say that to me again, I'm gonna kill you. I swear I will. Hello? Hello? Anybody in there? Please open the door if you're there. Hello? Come on, please. Oh. Wait, wait, wait. We don't wanna scare her off. Excuse me. - 'Yeah, what do you want?' - I need to use a phone. Just hold it right there. Now keep back. - Keep back. - Please, just listen. 'Cause I'll bust all your goddamn heads. - And don't think I won't. - Clarissa, are you alright? Get outta here, Rita, now. Just, just give us a chance... The only chance you're gonna get is to get your motherfuckin' asses in gear before I start swinging. Let's get outta here, man, I told you these people didn't want to help us. Come on. Look, we saw a boy get murdered tonight. And the men that shot him did it in cold blood and if they catch us, they're gonna kill us too. - What, they're following you? - No, no, we lost them. You gotta believe us, we're telling the truth. We just wanna use your phone to call the police. That's it. We're not gonna cause you any trouble. Please. Sykes, this is bullshit. We lost 'em, man. We're just wasting our time, man. You know something? You are really beginning to piss me off. Where he goes, we go. Now, shut the fuck up. Yo! Yo! Hey, sup? Yo, man, these the punks you saw, man? Nah, they ain't the ones, man. What's up? You punks crazy or something, man? Chill out, man. We're just looking for some citizens. Ah, you looking for some citizens, y'all. You ain't gonna find nobody down here like that, man. This is our block, alright? Now, if you got any brains in your head, man you gonna break now and don't look back. We just got some business, that all. - Oh you got some business, man? - Yeah. What kinda business you got here, man? Alright, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've had about enough of this bullshit. I'm gonna ventilate your little cranium. What do you think about that, huh? Now, back off. 'Hey, man, you better get your boy, Jack.' - Alright. - Got some too, man. Just a little bit too much meat today, that's all, man. 'Come on, man.' You don't like what I have to say, fuck me. Come on. - What you smiling at, man? - No, I understand, man. I respect that, I know what you're doing. You're taking care of your block, that's great. But these motherfuckers ripped me off. That can't happen. You know what I mean? - I don't know. - Yeah, you know, man. If I fuck with you, right now you'll look like shit in front of your boys. So you tell me, how much is this gonna cost? Man, if I want your money, I'll take it, man. No. You can't take my money. But you can take my money. - Go ahead. - Money got blood on it, man. You ever see any that didn't? Now, why don't you go ask, uh, Webster over there which building those people went into, okay? 'Alright.' I don't believe this. Ray, you're wearing a hole in the carpet, bro. 'Cops should have been here by now.' It's been... 17 minutes. Down here people die of old age waiting for the cops. No goddamn way. That's bullshit. Watch this. I'll get their asses over here in one goddamn second. - What's wrong, Ray? - The phone's dead. What do you mean, it's dead? Give me. It must be them. They're here. How do you know that? Maybe you didn't pay your phone bill. - Oh, yeah, right. - Just shut up, Ray. Francis.. ..Howard... Wyatt. Used to have a girlfriend named Francis. 'She had blue eyes, just like you.' How does he know my name? Frank. Beautiful baby. Wow. Lucky for you she looks just like your wife, huh? What's your wife, Italian? I always wanted to fuck an Italian girl, Frank. I'll tell you what, Frankie. Francis, since you won't come out and meet me man-to-man I'm gonna take my case to the people, alright? 'People of the housing projects.' 'I got a headline for you. This just in.' Get the fuck outta my house. Go on. 'Mommy!' Honey.. Get the hell outta my house. 'This is the situation. Here's the deal.' 'Give him up now and this will not be' 'the worst night of your life.' There's nothing on three floors, man. - We got two more to go. - We gotta take a break. 'Yeah? Well, I told you you should've quit smoking.' It's okay. Everything's gonna be alright. - We can't stay here. - Are you kidding? If we go out there, they're gonna kill us. Damn it, Ray, these people put their lives on the line for us. - Frank's right. - Yeah, go. Let's do this. No, way, I'm not going out there. - Oh, my God. - Okay. Jesus, Ray. I'm not going anywhere. 'You son of a bitch.' You had that thing the whole time? Why the hell didn't you use it when we needed it? - Shh! Because I'm using it now. - On us. Yeah. Whichever one of you thinks you're gonna get me through that door. Goddamn it, Ray, what are you doing? You're scaring the kid. The cops are gonna be here, any second, okay? Let's just wait here until they get here. The cops are not coming. Yes, they are. Stay right back, okay? I am not gonna die down here. Ray, these people weren't involved and they helped us. If those bastards find us here, they're gonna kill everybody. 'Is that what you want?' You gotta trust me, man. They don't want this deal. Come on, Razor. Give me the gun. - Okay, let's get outta here. - Go to the roof. The kids have a way of getting across to the next building. It's the only chance you have. Thanks a lot. 'I have a baby! Please! Leave us alone!' 'Open the fucking door, now.' 'Come on, let's go up to the next floor, man.' 'You better not be lying.' Give me the gun. Give me the gun. - 'Let's go.' - 'What a shithole.' Here. Here, use this. Knock, knock, faggot. Open the door. Hey. Ow! Hey, man! Fuck. I found it. Jeez, is that the escape route? 'Huh?' Let's do it. 'Let's go, Ray.' 'Over here, over here.' Kids do this. Let's go, Ray. 'Hang on, Mike. Hang on, buddy.' Ray? I can't. The pipe, Ray. Use the pipe. 'It's right there. The drainpipe.' 'You can shimmy down that.' 'Let's go, Ray.' 'We used to do this kinda thing when we were kids, remember?' Alright, now just slide down. Just slide down. Now, Ray, whatever you do, don't look down. Thanks, pal. I wasn't going to. 'Hey, you know, Ray, I've got a great view from down here.' That's funny, Frank. I'm glad you saved your best material for the rooftop show. Thanks. I'll be here all week. Come on, Ray. That's good, that's good. Yeah, when I get down, I'm gonna kick your fucking ass. John, get your ass across that ladder now. What the hell are you guys doing? 'John, what are you.. There's a way down over here.' Let's go, Ray. Come on, Ray. Alright, John, come on, buddy. 'Don't look down, buddy. Look at me.' Okay, that's it. You're now at like the 40 yard line, man. 'Come on. Here you go.' 'You're on the 30 yard line, man.' 'Twenty... now the 10.' That's it. Alright. Next. Go ahead.. I wanna follow you. You go first. - You're full of crap, Ray. - Come on. Listen, climbing across this thing is not gonna kill you. - Those guys are. - Come on, I swear to God. 'Come on, Frank!' I can always tell when you're full of crap, Ray and you are full of crap, right now. Don't make me leave you up here, man. Don't do that to me. Look, I said I would do it! 'Move it!' Do you want me to put it in writing? I will follow you. Alright... let's do it. Come on. Watch how simple this is, huh? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 'That's good, that's good, man, alright.' 'This is it. This is nothing, right?' 'There they are! Come on.' Come on, Frank. Move it. Come on, Frank! Motherfucker! 'Damn!' I don't believe these guys got guns, man. Yeah, too easy these days. 'Frank!' Go ahead. Check it out. Frank! Nice move. 'Come to me, goddamn it.' 'Come on, Frank.' 'Frank, come on.' Come on, Frank, come on, Frank. Come on. Give me your hand. Come on. Come on, Frank. I got you. I got you, come on. 'Come on. Okay.' Ray! What are you doing? I ain't no acrobat. I'm gonna negotiate with these guys. What with, Ray? I got these guys right where I want 'em. Frank, come on! - I'm the Razor-man, remember? - Let's go! - 'Come on!' - 'Come on!' Easy, fellas. Hear me out a second. Just give me a chance to talk, okay? What do you wanna talk about? Something near and dear to my heart, money. - Money, money's good. - Yeah. Money makes the world go around. Mike! You fire, they'll kill him for sure. And if I don't? - Okay, start talking. - First of all. There's no reason for any of this to be happening. Whatever happened to that kid, I'm sure he deserved it. That's your business. That's your business. Nobody's going to the police. All we want to do is get home. Home. Home is where the heart is, right? Uh, excuse me for a minute. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but, uh.. Didn't you say something about money? Yeah, I did. How about $100,000 cash? Then we go our separate ways. You can raise that kind of money? - Yes, I can. - Wow. Let me ask you somethin'. Those shoes, what are those, Italian? Yeah, they're actually Italian running shoes. Actually kinda working well for me this evening. - Yeah? - Yeah. And your dad's what, he's a, uh, a stockbroker? Somethin' like that, see but I'm a self-made guy. I'm a self-starter, just like you. Uh, that's funny. 'Cause these guys are always sayin' that to me. Hey, that's why we hang with him, you know. - Self-made man. - 'You just name the place.' Tomorrow morning the cash will be there. In the meantime, how about a little deposit? Um-hmm. May I see that? This, this is a beautiful ring. 'Rhodes, take a look at this, man.' - Check this out. - Oh, that's beautiful, man. Take this home to your girl. 'Tell me something, uh, how much is a ring like that worth?' Retail, that's 15K. But for you guys, tsk-tsk.. Call it a down payment, under the table. You know, I think, uh, I think we can cut a deal here. Oh, man, yeah, that's beautiful. - 'There you have it.' - I can't believe this. He's doin' it. You're pretty good, wh-what's your name? Ray. Ray, yeah, you're a good negotiator. "Cause you're didn't even low-ball me.' I'm gonna come in here and lowball you? Forget about that. Well, yeah, 'cause the thing is, I gotta trust you. There's the payment of money, and then there's your friends 'keepin' their mouths shut, you know.' Now hold on. We're businessmen, both of us. We have an understanding. Oh. Let me tell you somethin', uh, Ray. You don't understand shit. Okay? Nothing. 'Guys like you gotta keep checking your pants to see' if you got a dick, I got one. You and your friends are the kind of spoon-fed fuckin' fruit bait that I fuckin' hate. I don't think you understood me. Shut the fuck up! You speak when fuckin' spoken to, okay? This is not fuckin' high school, motherfucker! 'I'll eat your fuckin' friends for fuckin' lunch.' 'You know who we are? No, you have no fuckin' idea.' Do you? No. Jerks like you, you just sail through life reading about people like me in the newspaper. Hey! You're in a different place now, motherfucker. Yeah, $100,000 might buy you out in North Shore down here. Pussy, that means shit! This is my fuckin' world. Two hundred thousand! Alright. We got a deal? Yeah. This, you had.. you schooled me. You picked my heart off the ground and had it surgically implanted. Ray. 'Just a bit, my pulse will be back to normal.' - God. - Ray. Music to my ears. It's beautiful. I'm gettin' off this roof in one piece. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Aah! - Motherfucker! - Jesus. - Motherfucker! - It's alright. No! Let me go, Frank! Okay, Frank, wait! Okay! Come on, John, move. Don't look at him, John. Come on, he's gone, man! Come on. Frank. Shh. We should've done something. Makes no sense for Ray to go out like that. Nothing about tonight makes much sense. I keep hearing him screaming. Hello, ladies. Well, well, well. It's our little chicken shits. 'Go! Go!' - 'Which way?' - This way! Get off! - Frank! - Get down, get down! Go, go, go. Go, go, go. - Aaah! Go, go, go! - Aaah! - This way, this way. - Right here. - Ha-ha. - Woo-hoo! 'Mike.' John. We gotta keep moving, man. Split up. Man, this is stupid. You really think we're gonna catch these guys? Yeah. You comin'? Watch your ass. Shit. I always do, mom. ♪♪ Oh when the saints ♪♪ Aah! ♪♪ Go marchin' in.. ♪♪ These guys don't give up. ♪♪ When the saints go marchin'.. ♪♪♪♪ They're right on our ass. We gotta get outta here. It's hard to tell where they're coming from. We don't want to run into them. Uhh! 'No, no, no, it's too bright up there.' 'You might as well stick a bulls-eye on your back.' What are we gonna do? We gotta make a stand. 'It's our only chance of gettin' out of here alive.' I always wondered how I'd do in combat. Could I cut it? You ever wonder about that, Frank? Guess I'm about to find out. Mike, they got guns. We have nothing! Screw the guns! If we watch each other's back, we'll be, we'll be okay. Right? Huh? - There you go, Johnny boy. - Let's do it. Hey, Frank. Let's show these punks what we got. Right. 'Hey, there's three ways in here, there's three of us.' 'We watch each other's backs, huh?' Okay, let's go! Go! 'Sykes, where you at? You guys down there? 'Mike. Mike!' I got your back. 'Hey, I'm relyin' on you, bro.' Frank! Frank! - Yaah! - Unh! Yaa! Where're you guys at? Hey, don't you move, don't you move. Alright, who's the chicken-shit now, huh? You gonna shoot me? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You ever shoot anybody before? I don't think so. Now, if you don't give me that back the same thing that happened to your friend Ray is gonna happen to you. Ohh! Man, did you see the look on his face? He didn't think I could do it. 'Sykes! Talk to me, man!' Let's move. No, screw that! Hey, I say we stay down here and we finish 'em. You know, things are a little different now, huh? What is the matter with you, huh? This isn't a goddamn game! John, let's go. Hey! Hey, what, what happened to you, kid? Hey! Hey, I thought you had my back. 'Hey, John. I'm talking to you.' We gotta find some cover. What the hell happened to you down there? Huh? - I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sorry doesn't cut it. You almost got me killed. Hey! Back off, Mike. Your baby brother fucked up! He better not do it again. Oh, yeah, or what? See, that's-that's the Frank, I used to know. You better believe it. Now let's get off the street. Yes, sir, boss. This is great. You know. I don't know about you guys. But I didn't sign on for this. 'This is your fault, Fallon.' 'Your best buddy's dead because of you and your goddamn rules.' 'Hey.' 'You ever hear the one about taking care of your own?' 'Huh?' You mean you'd let these guys get away with this, right? No, I wouldn't let these guys... You know what I hate? I hate whiners, you know. Hate people who just complain. 'Complain, complain.' Met a guy in a joint one time his cell next to me you know he's to.. Just used to yap about everything. Used to yap about the food, yap about the guards and yap about this and yap about that and yap, yap, yap all night long. Fuckin' yap, yap, yap. Like a fuckin' 747, you know what I mean? Like an engine stuck right between your ears and you can't get away from it 'cause he's right next to you you know what I mean? I don't think he's gettin' up. He's gone now. Oh, damn it. If those assholes were here right now, I'd, I'd.. I'd probably just freeze. I tried, you know.. 'I couldn't move, Frank.' John, you gotta keep it together, man. Keep it together? Fuck you, Frank! I'm scared. I'm really scared. And I don't think I'm gonna make it through this fuckin' night. I don't know what to do. - John. Come here, come here. - No, Frank, no. Everybody gets scared. Whether they admit it or not. I'm scared too. Look at me.. I'm cryin' like a baby here. Thanks... for stickin' up for me back there. Yeah, well, Mike's as scared as we are. Hey. There's nobody out on the street. So what do you think, boss? Why don't you cool it on that "Boss" stuff? 'You guys aren't gonna believe this.' 'Let's go!' Hey! Hey, yo! Wait! Wait! Hey! Hey, we're here! Hey, stop! Look, hey. Hey, lady! Hey, well, hold up the bus! - What are you doin'? - Hey! Hey! - Stop the bus! - I don't think so. - Hey, come on! - Come back, you bitch! Come back. Come back! Mike, you're gonna give us away! I don't get it. You used to have bigger balls than anybody. Is that what you think this is about, balls? What about using your goddamn brains? - Watch what you say to me! - What're you tryin' to prove? That you can get us all killed? Because that's exactly what you're gonna do. I got a wife and a little girl and I will get back to them tonight. You wanna go out there like you're some kinda goddamn hero? Then you do it alone. Let's go, John. - Frank! Frank! - What, goddamn it? Just wait up. No. Maybe there's another way in. It's kinda dark. I don't see anything. There's gotta be a security guard on duty. Well, let's try and, uh, wake him up! - Hello? - We're in trouble now. Hello? Hey, concierge, I need a room! Hell of a security system. Excellent response time. - Hey! - Yo! 'Anyone home?' - Hello? Anybody here? - We're here to rob the place. Yeah, anybody got a problem with that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yo, come on and get us. - 'Okay, freeze.' - There's two of 'em. I said freeze! And put your hands on top of the counter and spread 'em. Do it! - Well, anything you say. - Alright, we're freezing. Yeah, we're freezin' and we're spreadin'. Anything else you want us to do? You frisk 'em. I'll call 5-O. Oh, Frank, they're calling the cops. - Hey, that's 9-1-1, buddy. - Tell 'em to haul their ass. These creeps are really loaded on something. Let's get to work. - Listen, man, the reason... - Just save it, punk! Look, these guys have been after us.. Look, you tell it to the cops. They get paid to listen to your bullshit stories. Hey, watch it. Careful, I'm ticklish. Uh, uh, mister, there's one thing I... No! Put your hands back up on the cooler. Put 'em up on the cooler! You understand me? - Don't make a move! - Okay. 'Attention, shoppers, we have a special in' 'the frozen foods department tonight, Dead meat.' 'Plump, juicy and fresh from our North Shore farm.' Shop 'til you drop, right, Frank? Get back on that cooler! Get on there! Hey, get on there! Get on there! You guys tell your friend to get his ass down here. - And I mean right now. - Listen, this guy's not... I'm tired of foolin' around with you guys. You understand me? Motherfucker! Hey, Mike. Mike! - Come on. - You go on. Damn. - Mike? - You go on. No way. I'm gonna deal with these guys. I'm gonna handle this. Would you cut this heroics crap? And let's go! Frank, you got a family. Me... all I got is you. Mike! Stay there. Mike? Hey, Frank!

'Come on.' 'Frank!' 'What are you afraid of?' 'Faggot.' Come on, Frank! I'm gonna kill your two fuckin' pussy friends and then I'm gonna kill you, alright? You look fucked up. At least I can walk. Hey, you fuckin' scumbag! I'm out here! I said I'm out here, you piece of shit! You know, Frank, after I kill you I think I'm gonna pay a little visit on that wife of yours. What did you say you were gonna do to my wife? What's the matter, asshole? Why so quiet all of a sudden? Aaah! No, you fuckin' dog! Ow! Ohh! Uhh! Oh! Jesus Christ. You're Frank?

'That's a fuckin' riot. Deadwood Drive.' Bet you got a nice house up there, huh, Frank? Hmm? Can't wait to meet your daughter. What's her name again? 'Ah, it doesn't matter.' You'll never see her grow up anyways. No more! Help me, for Christ's sake. I knew you'd do the right thing. Come on, Francis. You're comin' with me. - No! - Come on, Francis. You're on your own, pal. And don't call me Francis. 'Frank.' 'Frank, you alright?' 'Where are ya?' Stay where you are! Everything's alright! It's over. - '9-1-1. May I help you?' - Hello. This is an emergency. I need help. I need.. 'Sir? Are you still there?' 'Sir?' Look, my brother and my friend are bleedin' to death upstairs. - Get down on the floor. - You're not listening to me! Down! I don't fuckin' believe this. Hey, Al, he's tellin' the truth. It's like a battleground out here. Come on. 'Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.' Excuse me. How is he? He's lost a lot of blood, but his vital signs are good. Take it easy. Take it easy, man. Take it easy. Hey, buddy, they say you're gonna be okay. I better, I better be. I got tickets to the Bears game next week. Well, you have a good time. Wait, I got seats on the 50 yard line. Listen, I'm gonna be home with Linda and the baby watching the game on TV. You, you, you're a wimp! - Hey, John. - Yeah. Mike got you tickets to the Bears game.
