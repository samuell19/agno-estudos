Yes. Pippi Longstocking, forever! Hooray! Hooray! - Thanks, kids. - Hooray! See, Pippi? All of those children envy you. Now let's set sail! Raise gangway! Weigh anchor. Aye-aye, cap'n! Raise gangway! Weigh anchor. No, wait! Papa, I can't go with you. Why, all of a sudden? Because I can't bear to see Tom and Annika so sad. Then, it looks like we're sailing without you this time. - Mm-hmm. But you will be returning very soon, won't 'cha? Of course I will, Pippi. I can never stay away from you very long. You know that! - See ya, papa! - Oye, Pippi! Take care of yourself. - I will. Thanks! - Ahoy, Pippi! - Ahoy, Firdolf! - See you later! - See you, Firdolf. See you, papa. I'll be expecting ya. Pippi, I think I'd better leave you some gold. I don't need any gold. But just in case you do. One bagful. Hup! Don't worry, I'll get it. Oh, she's gone. Hey, blow blom, come up here. What's wrong, Dunder? See that... See that satchel? Oh! A satchel of gold. - Yeah, let's go. - Quick! Hey! What? We thought you had sailed away. And leave such good friends? Aw, Pippi. Say, I believe since she's staying here, I can still have her sent to a children's home, right? Right. - Gold! - Gold! Pippi, I'm so happy you didn't go away. So am I, Pippi. You know something? So am. Hello, villa Villekulla. You mean more to me than any straw hut on a south sea island. And lemon tree, you're better than a tropical palm. Hey, you really outdid yourself! What an appetite? Come here. You little rascal. Just don't complain later if you get a tummy ache. Hey, Mr. Nilsson, you're happy to be home too, aren't you? I was never happier than I was today, Annika. Me too, Tommy. Hey, I can see Pippi from here. I'm lucky to have a nice home like this. Too bad Tommy and Annika have to go to school tomorrow. Oh, well! I have lots to do. First, I'll clean this villa from top to bottom. Then I'll get a good night's sleep to be rested for tomorrow. Come on, blom. Let's go. We lost a bag of gold once and that'll never happen again. Yeah! We're not gonna get caught again either. No. Mmm! Mmm! Good morning. Good morning? It's after four. Humph! So what? I have been dancing the night through, Annika. The polka, that tires you out. You should have left me sleep. I dreamt that my papa was worried that I might get corns, Tom. - Longing for your pa-pa? - He'll be home soon, Tom. Pippi, I never want to grow up. Neither do I. Kids have more fun than grownups. Well, we don't have to grow up if we don't want to. We can take some magic pills I have for that. Krumelur's pills! - Krumelur's pills? Sure, now where did I put those Krumelurs pills? But, Pippi! Everybody has to grow up. No, not with these, you don't. Those Krumelurs pills probably turn you to stone. Funny how you always find everything, except the thing you're looking for. You, see? We could find those secret pills if 1 hadn't tidied the house up. Oh, the gold. I'd better put a few pieces in my pocket, in case we decide to buy some candy later. And don't worry, I'll find those Krumelurs pills. ♪ Case of gold case of gold ♪ we will get that case of gold ♪ from that redhead ah! I knew, I put 'em here somewhere. Oh, those are just peas. Do these look like peas to you? Don't cha know Krumelurs pills when you see 'em? Sure look like peas. All you have to do is take one of the pills and say the magic words. Do you know the magic words? An Indian chief taught 'em to me. "Fiery little Krumelurs ball, "always keep me young and small". Do you have to say "fiery"? If you don't, you might grow faster. I'm not taking any of those pills. I'll say it wrong and grow fast. So we'll take 'em together, and nothing'll go wrong. Okay, if you think it's all right, Pippi. "Fiery little Krumelur ball, "always keep me young and small". Boy! We said that right. Do you really think we'll always stay little, Pippi? Yes, if those three pills kept their strength, we're all set. And we'll be just as small in fifty years. Mm-hmm. Oh, Pippi. You're so great. Gee, am I glad you didn't go away. - Good night. - Good night. See you, in the morning. Think up anew game, Pippi. I know one. We'll go down to the river and skate on the water. - Impossible. - Impossible, huh? Nothing's impossible, remember that. See you tomorrow. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, good night. Klang! Look. That's blood! There's been dirty work. Blood! Kling, I think we've picked up the trail of a killer on the run. His victim must have been badly injured, Klang, bloody feet. We have to pursue his foot trail. Hmm, you notice, the victim has two left feet. You figure, it's peg-footed. You mean peg-legged. Could be, come on, we have to find out. Gee, she sure has lots of freckles. Pippi, come look at this sign. - Pippi. - Wha-at? Did you see this poster? No. "Do you suffer from freckles"? - Why do you ask that? - Not me. That's what it says on the poster. Oh! Well, isn't it nice of them to be so interested in me? A polite question deserves a polite answer. Let's go in. Good morning. Help you? Hmm? - Nope. - Idon't understand. About that sign! No, I don't suffer from having freckles. But-but you look at your face, child. Sprinkled with spots. But I don't suffer from having these spots. The spots on my face feel pretty nice. I see. May I show you something else? - Some perfumes, maybe. - Well, they run high. That's okay! Annika, wanna smell like a flower? Come on, Tommy! You can use some of this, too. You call that a flower? Pee-yew! Dd oh! They suddenly stop here. - You're right! Hmm, hmm. Oh... Without a trace. Can you explain this, Kling? No, Klang. Can you? No, Kling. Here! Listen, Klang. Not a word of this to anyone. - No, not a word. - That's right. We didn't see this. Let's go. O-Okay. Nope. Not right. Watch how I do it, Tommy. You hold it like this... One, two, three... One... Never count when I throw. Two... Three... and! See the action? Now the most important thing is to aim when you throw. Tommy, Annika, where are you? - Here, Pippi. - Hi, pippl. Hey, did you make those kites yourself? - Mm-hmm. - All three of them? Oh, well! We need one a piece, shall we send them up? Sure. They're very nicely put together. I'll ask mommy if we can go now. Mommy! Meanwhile, you rest in the shade, old man. But don't stray. - Mommy! Hey! Hi, Pippi. - Hi. - You wanna throw darts? - Sure. - Come on. Okay! You see that? I'll show you how you do it now. The whole secret is in the stance, left foot forward, right foot back. That's right... A-A-A little farther. Now you hold the dart between your index finger and your thumb... Just like that. And then you do this little ceremony. Watch and learn. One... two... Three... Hup! One! Two! Three! Hup! Pippi, we can fly the kites. Okay, I left my horse resting in the shade. Let's get him. - Hey, Pippi. Yes? I thought you wanted to toss a few. Ah, that's right. Now this is your first time, so don't expect to do so well as I'm doing, but... Here. Take 'em and remember what I taught you. Uh-huh. Right? - Yup, that's right. Tommy, you got all the kites? - Yup! - Come on! Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nilsson, the flying monkey. You know, I could lie here all day and just watch the kites. I wish I could fly, the way the birds fly. But you can't. People can't fly like birds. I'm not so sure. I've never tired it. Gee! I might have the ability of an eagle. Wait! What are you planning to do? - I am going to fly. - Come on now, Pippi. Don't you do anything foolish. Wow! No one ever knows what's going to happen with you around. Fly, my little kite, bird, eagle, soaring high. Spread your mighty wings up high and fly. Pippi!! You know something? It isn't as easy to fly as I thought. I need more practice. Hey, how about going over to the stream? Look, how fast mine is going now. Aw, my speed boat'll overtake your slow freighter. Wait and see. Humph! That's not a speed boat, it's a tanker! Hmm! Better send out an sos, Tommy. Hey, any food leftover for us fishermen? Sure! Are you hungry? - And how! - We're starving. Okay, two orders of grub, coming right up! Dunder, isn't that the girl who had that gold, hm? - Yeah! - Excuse me! Aren't you Pippi Longstocking? I think I know you. Yes, you should really remember me very well. Ah, 1 do. I do remember you. We recognized you right away! The freighter's putting out to sea. With what, huh? Freckled sausage. My mouth is watering. What's taking it so long to get here? Quick, before it passes by. You holding? Yeah, i-I'm holding, i-I'm holding. Just get it in. Just take one, just take one. Okay, okay! Okay! Here comes the next freighter. Wh-what's the cargo? Flying saucer pancakes, my own recipe. I bet they're great! Number three freighter. - Egg? - No, it's my turn. Is that an egg on there? - Baked pang! - Pang? What's that? - An egg from a rooster. See, roosters don't normally lay eggs, so when one does, it goes, "pang!" - That's mine! - Take it easy. Thanks! You're a sweetheart. A gold piece! Stupid game! Ah, there you are. You were gone along time. Did you have fun? - Sure did. So much happened. Oh, you must tell me about it. Dad, have you been practicing since this morning? Yeah. Since this... This morning. Do you mind? Pippi. - Hmm? Those bulls-eyes this morning, they were accidental, weren't they! - I don't know. Try it again and we'll see, okay? - If you like. - I like. Please, try it. I simply went like this. Wha! Oh. I still have seventeen raspberry suckers. I only have fourteen. Wanna trade a coconut for a raspberry? - I hate coconut. - Yeah, me too. Who wants to trade a bubble gum? - Nobody. - Mmm, see that? Come on, hands off! That's mine! - Are those all yours? - You can have one. Me, please? All right. Tell me, kid, where did you get all that assorted candy? From Pippi, tomorrow's her birthday. - Ah, ha! - Ah. Hi, anybody see my father pass by? Is he blue-eyed and tall? Yes. And does he have two arms and two legs, like some other people? - Sure. And does he wear black shoes and a tie? Yes, that's the one. Did you see him? - No, I'm afraid not. - Hmm. Old man, you're eating like a pig! You're supposed to save your appetite for the birthday party. Otherwise, when it comes time to eat, you won't be hungry. Oh, Mr. Nilsson, will you stay away from that sugar? You can have all you want, later. Hi! - Happy birthday, Pippi. - Thank you, Annika. - Happy birthday. Thanks, Tommy. Come on in. I've got some surprises. Those hurricane lamps are neat. Oh, a music box. The nicest present I've ever got. And filled with candy coated chocolates, too. Mmm! Well, now I've got some presents for you. Pippi, this is your birthday. You're supposed to get presents, not give 'em. Tom's right, Pippi. You're always reversing things. I know. Well, then, why do you keep on doing it? That's my creed, Annika. Accomplish what I've thought of. Even if it's the opposite of what others do? Sure! Oh, Pippi, how nice you are. Thanks very much. Yeah, thanks a lot. Okay? Everybody have enough? - I'm stuffed. - Me, too. Good, then I'll start cleaning up. We'll help you, won't we, Tom? I guess so. It doesn't hurt for a boy to help with the dishes. When I'm full, I clear the table right away. Do you do that when you have a party? Sure, but not the way you do it! What are we going to do now, Pippi? I've thought up something special for us to do. Like what? Suppose we climb up to the attic and rummage through old things. - Hey, that's fun! - All right. Say, you can't comprehend the fun. My attic's alive with spooks, and goblins, and things. - What do they do? Most of the times they bowl with their heads. How terrible! What's terrible about that? I think bowling is lots of fun. Follow me up the steps. I think I'll just remain here. Suppose a goblin comes creeping down and finds you sitting here all alone. You're not supposed to say such things! Well, are you coming or aren't you? Oh, I suppose it would be better if we all stayed together. Sure, you come with us. Hey, you spooks! I'm coming up with some visitors, so I want you all to behave yourselves, you hear? [Hooting] I should have known all the ghosts were away. They're at a club meeting. Hope they stay there. There's one. Oh, that old sleepy head'll get there late. That was no ghost or spirit. What you saw was just a plain old, ordinary hoot owl. That's all. An ordinary owl? Yeah, anyone saying there are spirits here gets a real tweak of the beak, understand? But you said that the place was full of spirits. By George! The rule stands. What's that, Annika? A spirit thing. Didn't I say there are no ghosts? I wanted you to see these relics, I found. A pistol and nightgown of my papa's. Aw, phoo. That's no combination Pippi. Sure, the nightgown's non-violent. The pistol's dangerous. It's even. Hey, here are some more pistols. Anybody want a couple of 'em? Oh, yeah. Oh, Annika and I are not allowed to play with these. Are those pistols loaded? Gosh, no. Think we're crazy? Never play with a gun, my grandfather told me, because it might be loaded. What's that? A ghost just lost his toe. Pippi, this is the funniest birthday party ever! You know, tomorrow our parents are going to the city for three days. And Mrs. Pryssel, they've asked her to take care of us. It would be that fuddy-duddy. Yeah. Well, we'll straighten her out. We'll act cute, right? - Mm-hmm, act cute. - Tommy, it's late. We better go. - Okay, catch. Good night, Pippi. Thanks. Good night, Pippi. Thanks! Good night. Hope you enjoyed the party. Oh, yeah, it was great! Thank you. See you tomorrow. 'Night. Hey, I'm getting up real early to go fishing. Wanna come with me? Sure, we'll set the alarm for five o'clock. We won't even tell Mrs. Pryssel. - Night! - Night! Blom, I guarantee you she'll be asleep in the next thirty minutes. Hey, are you nuts? Ssh! Tommy, Tommy, wake up. We overslept. What's that? What'd you say? You know, Pippi's expecting us. Oh, that's right! It slipped my mind. We'll have to hurry. We'll climb out the window and slide down the drain pipe, so we won't wake up Mrs. Pryssel. Uh-huh. - Hi, Pippi. - Morning, Pippi. Ah, there you are. You mean miss pryssel let you go? Please, don't remind me. Of all people, why did we have to get lisey pryssel? The three days'll fly by. Hey! That looks like a canoe under the water. Yeah. It's a row boat. I saw it. Not much good any more you never know, it might be. Tommy, I think you're wetter than that boat, but we'll see. - Isn't that heavy, Pippi? - Not for me, Tom. It's a nutshell, but I think you were right. It's not in such bad shape after all. Where are you taking it? Home. Maybe we can salvage it. Afterwards we'll take it out and put tar on it to make it waterproof. And then? Then we put it in the water, it sinks, and we'll be shipwrecked on a small island. Were you ever shipwrecked, Pippi? Once, just like Robinson crusoe. Here comes lisey pryssel with warm underwear for us. Let's hide under the boat. Oh, Pippi! Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, what an accident! Here, I'll wipe it off. No, stop! Stay away from me, please. I brought Tommy and Annika these things, and you're to be sure that they put on this warm underwear. I'll tell them. Order from lisey, you two. You're to put on this warm underwear... Regardless of how hot the weather is. Hey, don't. That's scary. We're caught in a hurricane. Don't, pippl. You want me to get seasick? - Stop, stop! - We're sinking! Sinking? Ah! We're not, Pippi, you're teasing. This is very serious, we're in danger. Man life boats, fast. This is a kind of spooky island. Mm-hmm. Look, know what this is? - An Indian feather? - Uh-huh. All right, you Indians. Come out! We know you're there. I hear cannibals out there. Now, you just know there are no cannibals on this island. Wild creatures!

You hear that? - Do I hear what? - Waves. Wish we could be on taka-taka. Hey, where's everyone? Outside, scaredy cat. Our boat disappeared. Now we have to wait for someone to come and rescue us. Tommy's writing a message for help. I don't know what to write. I can't think of anything. Well, we have to get home before mommy and daddy get back. Give it to me, and I'll rinse it out. Write what I say. "Please rescue us from this island. "We've been two days without snuff". You can't write anything like that. It's a lie. Two days without snuff? And do you have any better ideas? No, all I know is that we must return home as soon as possible. All right, don't you start crying now. The boat hasn't disappeared. I just carried it more inland so it wouldn't get wet at night by the shore. Boy, if that isn't just like you. Where did you hide it? In the reeds. Oh! Time to leave. Okay, all hands on deck. Are you pulling our legs? No, Tommy, I'm just taking you to the boat. Gee, I hope we're home before dark. Lisey pryssel will have a fit. She shouldn't get so excited. Anyway, I'm coming over tonight. What happened? Who's hurt? Hurt? I thought something terrible had happened to you, because you were crying, like. Oh, you dear, sweet child, you. How cute! Auntie lisey, do you think Pippi, could stay awhile and have dinner with me? Of course, Annika. Poor Pippi should stay for the evening and get to see what a real home is. Right, my child? Thank you, auntie lisey. You've made your poor little Pippi very, very happy. May Tommy and Annika go with me tomorrow on a search? A search? What's that? Anew game I made up myself. See, most people pass things by without even noticing them. But if you keep your eyes open, you can find the craziest things. Hey, look what I found! - What? - Let's see. Isn't this a great pail! Why is it great? Well, suppose a doctor asks you how you're feeling. You can say "not so good, doctor. "I feel a little pail." Aw, gee. Or if you have a chicken, you stick it in here, and you have a chicken in the pot. Use it as a Halloween mask, to become the headless horseman. Or hang it in a tree, and presto. A bird house. Peep! Peep! You allowed to take anything? - Sure. - No matter what? Well, anything on the ground. Now, see that guy sound asleep? We found him lying on the ground, right? Right! So we're allowed to take him. Pippi, he's the mayor of the village! So what? He's lying on the ground, isn't he? He's ours. Finder's keepers. But we can't just take him along. Why not? We'll lock him up like a bunny! Hmmph, then what? Then we feed him what a bunny eats, nature food. Let's see how he likes dandelions. Open up. That's right. See, he likes dandelions? Don't take him, Pippi! Don't take him? Gee, you're strange, Annika. Any real treasure hunter would give his eye teeth to find a mayor, but, if that's what you want. Don't feel like treasure hunting anymore. We're not finding anything. Yeah, Pippi. That's such a dull game. A rusty old tin pail, that's all we found. Big deal! Hey, a spool for thread. A spool"? Yup! Look in the tree trunk, you two. I'm sure there's more. I told ya, keep your eyes open and you'll always find something. - How'd this get in there? - Hmm? - Something else? - Yeah, look at this. A necklace, made of rubies, I think. Tommy, I'm gonna go home and show mommy what I found. That's the right thing to do, Annika. I'd go with you, but I promised Mr. Nilsson and old man I'd stay and play while. - So long, pippl. - So long. Bye. I'll also start thinking of what we can do tomorrow. It's our turn to think up activities. Not a bad idea! ♪ Here comes Pippi Longstocking ♪ ♪ hope 'n a hey 'n a hope sha-na ♪ Okay, what'll we play, Mr. Nilsson? Hey, I've an idea!

Oh, she flew to the moon an hour ago. Yeah, she plans to stay there till next winter, provided, of course, she finds enough water to do her laundry. Oh, I think she has a screw loose. Pippi might be in the house. Of course, you're welcome to search the house, if you like. If you find Pippi, tell her that she must blow her nose every fifteen minutes, and that goes for you too. All children should blow their noses as frequently to keep their passages clear and get enough oxygen. I think oxygen is so important. Pippi! - Hey, Pippi! - Pippi! - Where are you? - Are you home? - Pippi! - Pippi! Where are you? Tommy, any idea where she could have gone? Nah, to the moon, she certainly did not go. Of course not.

Three, scrub your ears. - Well... - Children must stay clean! - We know that. Now, where's Pippi? She wouldn't go to the moon and leave old man here. You really had us fooled there, Pippi!

Right here in this tent, one of the most outstanding attractions it's been my privilege to offer. A little lady who handles dangerous snakes as though they were toys. Will you join me in welcoming the fantastic Paula! That's amazing. I bet there's another big snake in that wicker case. Sure, he's coming. Come on boy! That's it. You're nice. Gorgeous skin you have there! Your freckles are bigger than mine! Uh, we understand each other. Heaven, help us! Miss Paula, do something. The kid got your snake! Well, do something, Paula! What are you shouting for? I won't hurt the poor animal, you understand. Snakes are dangerous. She will hurt you. Don't you understand? She's poisonous. Keep your hands off! Keep your hands off! - Kling! - Hmm? See that? Blom! Ooh, Klang, you're right! Now we've got him! That means that thunder-Karlsson is probably near here, too. You'll see. - Shh! Got you, blom! All right, and now you can tell us where your sidekick is, too. Oh, excuse me! Oh, my! I'm very embarrassed! But it's all your fault, you know. One should never hide one's face. Phooey, boy, you were just peeking! I think you should look into this. Ooh... Guess what, Mr. Nilsson, it's snow! I'm going out. You stay here where it's warm. Hooray! The first snow! Oh! Now what did I do with my warm winter jacket, and that blue scarf? ♪ Ping says each little drop of snow ♪ ♪ hush says the stream ♪ ♪ all the world is sleeping nature's secret keeping ♪ Hi! Aw, don't leave. We won't hurt you. Hey, why are you two going to school? Just to sit still and learn Plato? I know something better than Plato and all that nonsense. Ah, well, Tom and I enjoy going to school every day. We have a nice teacher. Oh, time passes by very quickly. Right, before you look around, there's another holiday. Easter, summer vacation. Now it's Christmas time. Christmas is the best of all. - It's so unfair! - What do you mean "unfair"? Because you guys get vacations and I don't. How can you get vacations without going to school? Well, I want my school vacation, too. So, I'm starting my schooling right now! Great! Then you can come with us. No, Annika. When I said "right now" I didn't mean this very minute. First I have to go home and clean things up a bit. But I'll be coming later on. See ya. Mr. Nilsson, what have you done? Mmm, oh, I'll never finish. Well, if you're gonna act like an ape, you belong in a cage. Now if you behave yourself, you can come out. And if you're really good, I'll take you to school with me. "In the... "Far-eye-yun land he waited". "In the foreign land he waited." Try it again. - "In the foreig..." - Well, I got here! Am I too late for the Plato lecture? Come and join us, pippl. You're cordially invited. It's about time you started school. The important thing is that I get my vacation this Christmas. - Your full name, please? I'm Pippi Longstocking, the daughter of a sea captain, who is a pirate and chief of an African tribe. I have a long Swedish name, but everybody calls me " Pippi." Well, we'll call you " Pippi," here too. And this is Mr. Nilsson. Say "hello." Well, Pippi, I think it would be advisable not to bring Mr. Nilsson to school. Are you saying that you don't want Mr. Nilsson to know anything about the great Plato? This class is only for children. Let's get started, please. You take that seat over there. Okay. Now, Pippi, tell me how much is five and seven? Don't you know? Of course. Five and seven are twelve. If you know the answer, what are you asking me for? Because I want to see what you know. To show you what I mean, I'll ask some of the other children in the class. Uh, Tommy, suppose you have seven apples and your sister has nine. How many apples do you have all together? - Hmm. - That's not the point. Eat those apples and they'll get sick! Annika, now we'll work on your problem. Say a girl leaves with ten coins in her purse. When she returns, she only has two. How many coins did she spend? Why would you want to know that, teacher? After all, the money she had was all her own, wasn't it? So she could spend it as she pleased. This is just a test example. See, Pippi an example. Aw, shucks! Examples like that make no sense to me at all. How nosey they have grown. Shh. Name this letter, please. It has a straight part. Part looks like a fly landed on it. Do you know what this letter is? Yes, it's a big worm. It's too skinny to be a snake! Well, let's move on now to our art lesson. Draw whatever you like. Hey, did you see what Pippi's drawing there? - Do you see what she did? - Pass it on! But, Pippi! Why don't you draw on a drawing pad, like everyone else? Do you think I can fit a big horse like this on a tiny piece of paper? We can't go on like this. Children, I'll try one last attempt. Stand up, up and sing. - Okay. The little German song we learned last week. What is it, Pippi? You know what, teacher? I think I'll just go home, and start the celebration for Christmas. Best thing to do, I think. But you're always welcome back. Thanks. For Plato lectures I'll be coming back for sure. The Argentina schools don't do nearly as much talking. That's the place to go. Come, Mr. Nilsson. Let's go. So long! - So long, Pippi! - Goodbye! Don't forget, come and see my snow man later, - will ya, hm? - We will! We'll have a snowball fight! Hey! Thanks for clearing such a big lane for sleigh riding, Pippi! And for this snow fort! When I finish this snowman, you can give him big eyes. - Is that his bottom there? - No, his nose. - Hey! Watch it, stupid! - Watch where you're going! - Hey! - Huh? That's Pippi Longstocking! Now's our chance. While she's here, we'll run over to her house and grab that bag of gold. - Should we risk it? She's so strong! Look, if she isn't there, how can she hurt us? Let's go. We have it, we have it! Look at us! We have it! We have it, we have it! Look at us! We have it, we have it! We're rich, we're rich! Look, there she is. Little does she know she's a pauper! Hoo-ooo! Hoo-ooo! Pippi, they've stolen your bag of gold. - Look, no hands. - Regards from Mr. Nilsson! Guess we'll never see you again. Watch it! - Did you hear what she said? - Yeah. Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Sorry to have to do that to you, but you had to be stopped and had to be taught a lesson. Unhand me, you cad. Shame on you! You know I never turn down anyone in trouble. Remember that time at the stream, I've gave you sandwiches and pancakes? But even then, you were trying to get that case of ancient gold pieces away from me. Well, Pippi, we didn't think it would turn out this way. If you could just find it in your heart to forgive us, we'll go away and never come back. - Never! Well, here are a couple of gold pieces apiece. After all, it's nearly Christmas. Blom, where you running? She's not going to hurt us. - I'm hungry! Come on! - Merry Christmas! Help you, please? Ah! That is precisely right. It's a gift for the dear children's home, you know. Here, is that all right? - Yes, thank you. Well, hello, Pippi. What are you thinking of doing for Christmas, hmm? I always eat, the whole day long. By night time, my stomach hurts awfully, but it soon goes away. Oh, Pippi, dear. My heart aches at your remaining all alone on this Christmas. Imagine that! - Must you imagine it? - I think of it. Come to the children's home. - No! But you may not have much choice. Kling! Klang! - You'd like all three? - They're fun! - They're neat! - All right. - Thanks. Now, Klang, you're new here in this village, but I want you to help me or else I won't have a good holiday, understand me? - Come on! - We'll get her! Whatever you can do. Well, you'll have a good holiday. I'm sure of that. - Thank you in advance. - Hey, there she is. Pippi... Pippi Longstocking! ♪ I am Pippi Longstocking ♪ Hold it.

And can you guess how come? Because of all the presents still outside... And no one here to get them. Merry Christmas, Tom and Annika! The same, Pippi! Have a good Christmas, papa, on your sunny south sea island. And you, mama. Feel what? Am I unhappy on this Christmas? Nah, not really. What do you think Pippi will say when she sees this mob? - Oh, she'll be so happy. You think she's expecting anything like this? Not her. She's going to be surprised, all right. Are all the kids here now? Gee, no! More are on the way! How many presents were received by me, you ask? Oh, about fifty. Yeah, that was a fib, sure enough. But I won't have her worrying so. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everybody! It's Christmas Eve! We're going to Pippi's house. We're on our way to villa Villekulla. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Pippi! Our gift to you! Merry Christmas, dear Pippi! Ah! That for me? - For you, from all of us! Awfully nice. Thank you all, very much. A trumpet! Hey, that's a swell gift! How can I thank you? Just by being happy, Pippi! - Play it! - Play something! - Play something! - Yes, play something, Pippi! Whose idea was it to get a trumpet? Tommy and Annika knew she wanted one. Can you play it, Pippi? Of course I can! I put your gifts in the branches of the big lemon tree. You have to climb up there to get them.
