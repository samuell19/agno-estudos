Is it true that you're gonna be leaving the live stage? Are you gonna think about retiring? - Actually, yes I am. My last album just did better than I ever possibly could have imagined. And the tour has just been wonderful. And I figure I deserve a break, you know. I think it's time to relax a little bit. Except for my farewell concert. Except for that. - Well tell us about it. What can you tell me about this farewell performance? - Well, intimacy I guess, that's... - Well, I'm being told and I understand that it's going to set a world record for the biggest pay per view audience. I mean that's hardly intimate. - You know that's just hard to get my mind around. - You seem to be uncomfortable with that. - Well, when I think of my beginnings, I'll, I'll always be that confused girl whose life was saved by her guitar and her voice. And a notebook to just spill her guts out onto. - Thank you for your time today. - Thank you very much. Alright, tell us what our options are. - Well, I can tell you that just canceling would mean a tremendous loss. - So we're putting a postponement on the table. How long are we talking about here? - Well the doctors have made it very clear, we have to start aggressive treatment immediately, 'cause this thing can't be allowed to spread. - I mean, you're saying there's absolutely no way to turn this around? - No, it's too late. We have a production paid for, Rachal. - Yeah, but I'm afraid this is beyond our control. We have to cancel and that's that. - Well wait a minute. The show's right around the corner here. As I might say, you look very healthy and radiant. - Listen to me, you little shit. This may be a killing for you, but to us it's just another show and nothing gets in the way of her. Nothing comes before her or her wellbeing. Make myself clear, you freaking leech? - Easy Skip, he's just doing his job. - Hey I'm sorry, man. I think I've been misunderstood here, clearly. I just want Ms. Love to do whatever she wants to do. - What is it you wanna do, honey? Really, what do you wanna do? - Everything's booked, right? - Yes. - Why don't we turn this into an opportunity and make someone's dream come true. Find someone that is truly magical, someone that the audience will grow to love. Almost like a gift from me to my fans. - Who? - We'll find her. - Yeah, we can make this a competition. These things are huge right now. - And the winner will perform in my place. - I don't think another artist alive could pull this off. But with your fans and the back story and you personally endorsing the artist, the newcomer, as the continuation of your legacy, that would work. - Alright, you heard the lady. Let's make it happen. - More, more, more, more. Buy you some champagne, champagne, champagne. - What happened last night? - It was really, really slow, like there were two customers the whole night. - Didn't I tell you I can't have you passing out here in front of the customers? - I didn't mean to. The guy bought me vodka. You know I'm a whiskey drinker. And besides, I do better when I'm a little loose. - Gimme that. What are you doing walking around with that? Look, I don't care. I don't care. I let you come here and drink and have fun and this is how you thank me, by making me look bad in front of the customers? Anyone else would've fired you the first time you passed out on the job. Look, I don't care if you get a little bit loose. Hell, I don't even care if you get semi-shit faced. Just don't pass out on the job. That's all I ask. Don't pass out. You got it, sweetie? - There are conflicting reports... - Shut up, shut up. - Regarding the details, but it appears that the legendary singer Rachal Love has been diagnosed with cancer. There's an official report stating that Rachal Love will personally launch a world-wide search for an unknown female singer... - Put the game back on. - Who will pass on the torch, - Wait a minute wait a minute. - as she puts it, to perform in her stead at the massive show, which was to act as her farewell concert. All this in keeping with Rachal Love's well earned reputation as an outspoken champion of the underprivileged throughout her long and legendary career. The show, which is only a month away, will be the most widely viewed musical event in history. Wow, can you imagine this, all for an unknown female singer. Send in your submissions, girls. This is Anastasia Collins, reporting live from Hollywood. - Well there it is, Win. This is it, this is your chance. Mate, this is gonna be your break. If anybody in this entire world could carry the torch, it'd be you. - It's a joke. No one could ever replace Rachal Love. And music should not be about competitions, not boxing or something. Can you imagine the pressure of that? Your first gig, ever, in front of the entire world. And immediately they're comparing you to Rachal Love. What a nightmare. - Eric. Show Winter some of your tracks. Come on. Just use your charm. Just, just, just get up there. Come on. You look good, you look good. Let me see you. Come on, cheer up. Go up there. Just tell 'em you, just tell 'em you really need help with your music. Come on, come on. That's my girl. - Hey Eric. Guess who. Sorry for just stopping by. - No, he's just a little bit of a loner. Go. ♪ She lives in corners ♪ She hides in corners - Wow, you have Pro Tools. - Yeah. - It's like your own little personal recording system there. You steal it? - You know, like, singing's the only thing I'm remotely good at. I doubt I'll do anything with it, you know. Especially since my manager just dumped me. And I suppose I'm a little... - A little what? - Self destructive. - I guess I can't really blame Jimi for getting sick of me. Some people think I drink too much. But I don't. I can quit whenever I want. - Well I mean, don't you wanna like sing your words to everybody and be in the limelight or anything like that? - No, not really. I just wanna be able to write my lyrics and sing my songs. I love listening back to music when I'm done recording. You know, my foster mom used to sing to me. It's like my first memory I ever had of her. I was like four when she died. So that's like the only memory I have. And then I went from orphanage to orphanage and foster home to foster home. And then finally I just ran away. I never met my real mom or dad. - Sorry Winter, I didn't know that. - I'm well adjusted now. It's all good. - Well I'm working on this song, it's actually supposed to be a duet. So it's kinda like one verse is the male and then next one's the female thing. - These are fancy. I don't have these. - No? I stole 'em, so. - You stole 'em. Some people are just different, you know? - I guess. - You're definitely different. Unique. - I suppose. - In a good way, I mean. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think it's cool to be different. Thanks for walking me home, by the way. Very cool of you. Here we are, home sweet home. Come in. - Winter, I should, I should... - Just for a little bit. - You know what, Winter, it's getting late. - I wanna show you my guitar. I mean I can play you a song. Try to play you a song. Come on. Don't worry, I won't rape you. In here. That's where I store all of my ideas. - I remember when I sold you that. - I know, it's why I bought it. You said it was the best one. - Well it used to be. Well Winter, I gotta go. I gotta take off. - Why? - Tired, I gotta open the music store in the morning. - You're a musician. You've got an excuse to be late. Be late. - No, I mean it's a music store, it's a job kinda thing. You know? - What's the problem? I know this place is kind of a dive. - No it's nice. - Whoa, it's hot. - It is hot in here. I was just thinking. - This thing, it never works. - I have the same one and mine broke too. - Yeah, I had it for a week and then it just stopped. - Wow. - You know what this is? - What is that? - It's a baby bracelet. - This was your, like, this fit on you? - Um - It's so little. - I know. - Wow. - They found it on me when I was left at the church. I know. It's the only thing I have from my real parents. - I gotta go Winter, I gotta go. - I, I really wish you'd stay just a little while longer. You have the prettiest eyes. So handsome. - Jesus. Man. Shit. - Hey. - Hey. - Sit down. - Yeah. - Sit down. - I'm okay. - Yeah. Not unexpectedly, we got a mountain of digital submissions. And unfortunately we can't go through all of them. - There just ain't no justice in this world is there, Skip? - No, but I've made it easier for you, I think, because I've gotten the A&R staff at the label to help you winnow it down and we're gonna be meeting with a lotta new girls too. - The universe will send the right one to me. You'll see. The right one shall find her way. But remember what I said? She has to live the word she's singing and it's got to move me. - I know what you're looking for. A younger you, basically. You know, I should've been the singer around here. - I told you so. - With my beautiful voice. - It all ends so soon, doesn't it? - You know... it seems like yesterday when I walked into that dive Cassidy's and you were drunk as a skunk and you were singing your heart out. You were such a diva. - It smelt like piss in there. What kind of a diva is that? - Only three or four people in there, I think, but I'd never heard anybody sing like that before or since. Never, never. Hey, do you feel well enough to take a look at some of these new submissions? - Yes. Let's do it. - Okay. - How did you find me? - Well I, I woulda called but, you wouldn't have answered. So, I found you. Can I come in? - No, I don't do that anymore. - Yeah, I know that's not why I'm here. I'm here 'cause I wanted to see you. Winter, the way you left was like... I don't know, not very... How can I put it? It sucked, okay? In fact I... - I'm late for work. So I've gotta go. - Alright, now listen, I know that you probably have some mixed emotions about the time we spent together, but I just want you to know that I'm, I'm here for you. And I've went to great effort to try to find you. And I traveled a considerable distance, 'cause Malibu Canyon was really backed up for like hours. I think someone hit like a deer or something up there. Come on, let me in. - Alright, but just for a minute. - What's the rent here? The rent, the utilities and every... I guess those probably are included. What do you say that we take care of that, okay? And we close this place out. And we put out any fires that need putting out. 'Cause actually is anything on fire here? - Please, I don't want your money. - Why? I mean... Listen there's no strings attached here, okay? I don't want anything for it. I'm gonna leave this here and it's not gonna leave with me, okay? I don't want anything for it. I just wanna take care of ya. I just wanna make sure that you're not worried about... - Look, I'm already late for work, so. - Work, really? That's great. What are they? Whatever they're paying you, I'll triple it. And we get in a chopper... - Triple it? - and we go to Catalina. What'd I say, triple it? I meant quadruple. And we'll be having Smurf 'n Turf up at the... That place on the, you remember when we were there we were up in the, what was it, botanical gardens where we were smoking. - You really need to leave. Take your money, I don't want it. Just go. - Honey, is there any way that you would believe me? I don't know how to do this. I don't know. I never said this okay? I don't... I love you. Is that it? It's that simple, right? I love you. I love you. I don't care who hears, I love you! - Hey, Eric. - Preston. - Nice to meet you. Hey, can you just take your money and get outta here, man? - Yeah. - Appreciate it. So what's going on Winter? - It's not what you think, okay? Look Eric, I've done some things in my past that I am not proud of, okay? But things are different now. I had no choice back then. No choice at all. - Winter, you know it's exactly what I think, first of all. And who was that guy? - He's just an old, old friend. - Yeah? An old friend with a bunch of money sitting on the couch right next to you? - Please don't be mad at me. - But anyway so, what have you been up to? Tell me, tell me.

That's exactly why you're the one. Do you know my story? I mean my real story? Not the one from the tabloids and the papers. - No. - Well, my parents, they didn't want me. So, I ended up with my grandparents. For about a month. Well, they couldn't afford to keep me. When I was about four, I ended up in the system. - The system? I ran away from the system when I was 15. - You're kidding me. - No. - Wow. The universe is an amazing thing. We are soul sisters. When I was in the orphanage, I used to cry myself to sleep every single night. I just, I couldn't understand why my parents didn't want me anymore. That is when I started singing. I used to sing myself to sleep every night. It was a lot easier than crying. Then, Skip walked in to my life. In the dive bar that I was singing. He had a lotta connections. He was a big talker. And... I just, I knew this man could make me a star. But that is not what I wanted. So I told him to just leave me alone, go away. Skip showed me something that I wasn't able to see by myself.

It's been a roller coaster of emotions this past week as fans are devastated by the news that Rachal Love is battling cancer and will not be performing at her highly anticipated concert extravaganza. But already, allegations are flying that Rachal Love's camp is merely trying to avoid an enormous loss by creating a publicity stunt and hoping the public will fall for it. Whether music fans who've already paid top dollar will embrace this new unknown is yet to be seen. I'm Lawrence Mills reporting for Channel 8 News. - What a moron. Seriously. - Why? It's true. - Because he hasn't even heard you sing. - Exactly. - It's no biggie. - He's already like burying you or... - Fine. - No, it's not. - You didn't hear, man? - Hear what? - Winter. - What about Winter? - She's the one. Rachal Love, she chose Winter. - Well, I guess I quit. - Obviously, it's time for you to hit the big time. - I'm gonna miss this place. I'll probably be back before you know it. - I doubt it.

Now this is a surprise. - Yeah. - What the hell are ya doing here? - Well. - Come in. Would you like water or water? - I'm fine, thanks. You still got this thing? - My 16th birthday. You really caught me off guard with that one. I still play it every day. - You're gonna need a manager. That's right. Someone to steer the ship, keep you off the rocks. - Are you hot? I'm hot in here. - Yeah, it is hot in here, man. Can you open a window, maybe? I cut my first record when I was 15 years old. They found me singing on a street corner in the Bronx with a doo wop group. Yep. I recorded for Columbia. I just, just couldn't find the song, you know. I wasn't a writer then. But you... you're real. Your words are real. - So were your words when you dumped me. - Look, I wanna be there for you so you don't mess up again. You're like a daughter to me. - Is that right, Dad? What is it you want? - I wanna be your manager again. - This is hilarious. I got one gig. And I don't even want it. I don't even want this. I doubt I'll make a career out of it, so I don't even need a manager. - Now see this is what I'm talking about, Winter. I mean, why does your brilliance have to walk hand in hand with your need to destroy yourself? - I hate the idea of fame. I don't want it. It means nothing and I already know that. - Well what the hell are you doing? - I loved having you manage me these years. But it wasn't because I wanted to make it. Or some bullshit. - What were we doing then? - Honestly, I just needed a real friend. I don't care if you manage Nicole, or whoever. - I mean, that was a mistake, okay? - Just go. - This is our chance together... - Just leave. - I don't have much more time, okay? - You don't have any time? Is the that problem? You're out of time. So great to have these real friends. These there through thick and thin friends, just like my parents, Mr. And Mrs. There Through Thick and Thin. They didn't want me either. Now I got the gig and everyone's my dad now? You're my dad now? You love me now? No. "Get out of my studio, you worthless drunk. Don't you know this is a business?" But now you're my parent! I had no parents! And I don't want any now. You never did nothing for me. - That's a lie! - It was all for you. All for you. - Come on. - You hear me, captain? ♪ Seventh drink on the floor ♪ Seems I've done this all before ♪ - What happened? You know, you totally blew me off today.

They don't realize you're just a human being with real feelings and emotions. - No, they're right, though. I'm nothing but a drunk. And I know it. - You're so much more than that. - Why does everyone think fame and fortune are so great? I just wanna drink my whiskey and sing my songs to no one. Why can't they just leave me alone and let me do that? - You just don't realize who you are. - What am I? - You're an artist. You are a beautiful artist. You pick up the guitar and you create your own music, your own lyric, the melody. You help people forget their problems, their worries. That's a gift, baby. And you have the gift. It comes through you. - I'm sorry, Jimi. I know you really want this. - You have to want it. Otherwise it's not gonna happen. Hold on. It's Rachal. Hi, Rachal. - Hey Jimi, how you guys doing? How's my protege? - She's great. - Excellent. Is she excited? - Are you kidding me? She's over the moon. I've never seen her look so happy. - Great. Let me talk to her, put her on. - Alright, hold on. You know what, I think she just stepped out to get some tea. - This is ridiculous. I'm going to buy her a cell phone today. - Tell me about it. I bought her one and she lost it in a couple of days. - Sounds like something I would do. Well when she gets back have her call me on your phone. I wanna invite her to dinner tomorrow night. - What time you want us there? - Well I was kinda hoping it would just the two of us. I hope that's alright. - Yeah, that's fine. - Okay, talk to you later. - She wants you to. - I know, I heard. - Well, this is crunch time. What do you want to do? - I can't. I'm sorry Jimi. I really wish I could be what you want me to be. I'll tell her myself tomorrow. I'm sure there are hundreds of talented singers who are just dying to take my place. It's no biggie. - No biggie.

The press is coming down on her real hard. - You can't let her do this, man. - Yeah. - I think she actually wants this this time. She's just afraid. - Imagine being her. - Like her childhood and all? - Yeah. I mean, she never knew her mother or father. She went from one orphanage to another. She's on the streets when she was 15 years old. How much can one little girl take? - I know, she's all heart man, you know that. And they're gonna love her, man. - Yeah, they're gonna love her. And then they're gonna throw her away. And pick her back up again. And so and so on until... You think it's easy living a life like that? - So that's it then, we're just gonna let her quit? I was just over there man. She's curled up like a baby with a bottle of whiskey in her hand. - I don't know how to reach her any more. I don't know what to say. I mean, she's all tangled up in some kind of emotional mess. I can't unravel it for her. - She needs like a mother or a father or something, you know? Like authoritative figure that's gonna put her in check when she messes up, Jimi. And you're that guy. You need to be that father that she's never had. - You know why I didn't have any kids? I was selfish. I didn't want the responsibility. I woulda made a lousy dad. - I know, but it's better than, no one at all, right? - Help yourself to anything you want.

I don't know. - So, Winter? Are you excited about doing the show, you know since you're on TV. No one has returned the tickets, which is kind of incredible. - Yeah. I look forward to seeing it. - How are preparations going? I'm not gonna do the gig, you guys. - Lots of people gonna be watching. - Yeah, me too. Me too. - Well Winter, honey, is this like a joke? Are you kidding or are you serious about this? - Nope, not a joke. - Well. These guys are just gonna get going and we're gonna have something to eat. - Sure, we're gonna get going. - Yep. - Could I get a word with you, real quick? - Sure. You alright? - What the hell was that? - She says she's not gonna do the gig. - I know. I'll handle it. - With all due respect, Rachal, I don't think there's anything to handle. We have to get a suitable replacement today. - Not yet. I'll handle it. - The show is in three weeks. You have any idea how much money this thing has cost? Now that her name's out there already. I mean, if ya haven't noticed, this whole thing is getting mixed reviews at best. - Mel, I said I'll handle it. Is that clear? I will let you know what I decide tomorrow. - But, Rachal, why would we risk so much for such a loser? - Wait outside, Mel. - Look. I'm just trying to be realistic here. - Thank you. - You wanted a carbon copy of you, we sure got one, didn't we? - Yeah. - You pulled the same bit in 1975 before the Wembley Concert. - I know, I'm sorry. I am. - But she is the one? - Yeah. The universe is very mysterious. It sends me me. - What's your favorite word? - Karma. Yes, dearie me it is karma. We are all victims and benefactors of karma. - I always hated touring. I was always miserable and sick and, I mean even when I got successful and I could fly 1st class and stay in all the fancy hotels. It is, it's miserable. I'm not gonna lie. You know people think that you're experiencing this life of bliss beyond their wildest dreams. God, if only they knew. - Why would you do it then? What's your favorite song of mine? - That's a tough question. I love so many of your songs. Depends on my mood, I guess. I remember playing Broken over and over again when Jeremy Henstead broke up with me in the 9th grade. I looped that song for weeks. And I have to mention Remember. The lyrics to that song are why I knew I wasn't alone. It was like you understood exactly what I felt. - Now I want you to imagine your life exactly the way it is right now, but without those songs. - I can't imagine that. Your songs mean everything to me. - That's why the music is so magical. Because it makes us feel alive. It took me a long time to realize that. Because I really felt like I was worthless and... But if I had chosen to hold back my music, from you, I would've cheated you out of whatever it is you took out of my songs. - Thank you. - For what? - For your music. For being the soundtrack to my life. - You can thank me by taking that stage. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Look, the first number's really, really important. You gotta get 'em right away. They're not gonna give you another chance, okay?

She didn't wanna die in the hospital. She collapsed yesterday. It's happening so fast. God. - I'm sorry to be crass at a time like this, Skip. But, has Rachal signed all the papers yet? - Get outta this room. Get out! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - With the gigantic concert one week away, how do you feel? - I'm, great. Jimi, my manager, he's been working really hard with me. So I feel I'm training for some championship or something. - Cut. Okay, great. Strike it.

I always found that so strange. Sit down. I wanna, I wanna thank you. - For what? - For doing this for me. It means more to me than you could possibly know. And, I want you to always remember what I told you. That the music doesn't belong to us. It's all for them. You remember. - I remember. - Promise? Go out on that stage, and you give them everything. Okay? - I will. - I know you will. Will you come back after the show? - I'll come right after. - Okay. I'd like that.

Alright, just lie down. - I just need to shut my eyes for a second. - Yeah, just take a little rest, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah, I'll just rest. - Rach. Rachal. I'll see ya soon, kid. I hope. It's alright now. Yeah. God. - Your hair and makeup looks great. - Yeah. They did a great job. - Um - These lashes. - How you feeling? - I don't know. Like a gladiator about to face the lions. Come in. - Sorry Ms. Rose, but there's someone here who wants to see you. - Now? No, no, she can't see anyone now. - Says it's Winter's mother. - Her mother? Man. They're gonna come outta the woodwork now. - You want me to get rid of her? - Yeah. - Let her in. - Yes, ma'am. - Wow. Beautiful. I'm so sorry. There seriously hasn't been one day that I haven't regretted what I did. I was only 13 years old. I had no idea what was happening to me. And I couldn't, I mean I couldn't feed myself then, let alone a brand new baby girl. And so I left you on the church and I ran. So I had no choice, I just... I've regretted that my entire life, my entire life. It's the biggest mistake I've ever made. I'm sorry. I just... I didn't want you to cry. I should probably go. I just wanted to come and wish you well and watch you sing and see you... Have a good show. - Wait. - Please forgive me. I know you probably can't forgive me... - It's time. - Alright, you guys ready? We got two minutes to go. - Okay, okay, standing by, everybody, standing by. Listen, monitor in? - Yeah, I got 'em. - Okay, just relax. And just go out there and just do what comes naturally. And remember, don't wind yourself and communicate with the monitor man. Make sure he knows what you need in the mix, it's up to you, okay? This is your time, baby. I love you. - Are you ready to take the town? - Let's do this. - Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. Rachael Love has passed away. She has written a letter to you, all of her fans. And she asked me to read it to you. "I want to thank you all for making my life so wonderful." - Every-every letter and every present. Everything you've done for me has enriched my life beyond measure. I want to give you all a present, from me. Winter Rose. - "Winter Rose. She will sing for you now in my... in my absence. Please be kind to her." - Please be kind to her. - "She's a fragile and delicate creature." - She's a fragile and delicate creature.. Who feels life so deeply... just as I always did. - "I know that you all will fall in love with her just as I did." Until we meet again, love Rachal."
