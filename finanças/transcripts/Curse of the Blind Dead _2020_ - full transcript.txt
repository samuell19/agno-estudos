By your supreme power, offer us this gift as your faithful incarnation and grant us the protection we are due. May your blood become ours. Let it may become inflamed with every stroke of the dagger and inspire in us each day the faith that we profess to you now. Here they are, they'll all escape! She has the mark! Come on, kill her. He, too, is cursed. Take them out here! Death to the pagans! Burn them at a stake! Go! Stained by the sin of apostacy against Jesus Christ our Lord. Charged with the detestable crime of idolatry with execrable clandestine rites. Abhorring all humanity. You have honored an order suppressed in perpetuity. A vile coven of sodomites, rapists, and alchemists. For this, and other unspeakable abominations, you will be condemned by fire. Entrusting you to the tribunal of the lord. You shall burn nothing but our garments. No flame can incinerate our faith. The order is immortal! We will always return. Therefore, we shall burn out your eyes so that no light will lead you from the darkness. Do it. Open your hearts, my brothers. Our mission has ended. But others who share our faith will rise and carry it forward. Bring the devil's spawn and we may purify it. Oh, you shallow fools. The child's sacrifice would've protected us. You cannot stop the apocalypse. The light and the darkness will bind together once more and then he shall rise from the netherworld. What are you waiting for, Buggs? You're scared of the words of a madman! I confide them onto thee, oh Lord. The Army opened fire to quell the riots that for weeks have been spreading across various cities. News of a birth in the suburbs. It is the first this year. The boy is healthy and is already three months old. A sign of hope for a city that- Help each other and remain united. Faith only through faith. We have declared a state of emergency and they're willing to intervene with force. Let it be the reaction defend the nation to this decision. The presents should this progress made in recent years. Now that negotiations have broken down between the countries, the nightmare of a nuclear war has returned. Today we should talk about the possibility that- If you are receiving this message, seek refuge as soon as possible. I repeat. Find a safe place and do not use contaminated water for any reason. Should any signs or blemishes appear on your skin, this must be indicted to the emergency authorities by hanging a white cloth or handkerchief outside your home. Dad? Sky seem lighter to you? Today, outlines in the clouds. Do you see it? No, it's just like every other day. You all right? Yeah, I'm just a little restless. Like father, like daughter, like child, huh? Is it a garnet or not? Eh, I'll tell you what. What? You wanna rest here tonight? Still nothing? You know, I found some red berries over there and I thought to myself, "Who knows if you can eat them?" Better not. They were similar to the one we had in the camp. All right. That's enough for today. Don't worry, they were disgusting. What? You ate 'em? Yep. I had the same reaction. Okay, look... You know, we're near here somewhere in this direction. Day or two we should reach it. That's what the voice said. Yeah, well, that's what the voice said. Here. Do you think we're safe? Well, we haven't seen a trace of anybody in a long time. If anybody wants to join our party, they get this for dessert. We're not moving. You can take what you want, okay? We ain't gonna stop, right? You want the jacket. Okay, it's yours. Um... Please. Please. Listen. What do you want? We ain't got nothing else. Dad! Dad! Lily. Lily, it's okay. It's all right, you're all right. Wake up, huh? Come on. Open your eyes. - Oh my god. - She's still breathing. What do you want? We can take care of her. Just come with us. Last time there were more of them. Let's go, bring the woman. She's my daughter. Okay, take care of her. We'll get your stuff. No need to be afraid. I'm Kain. Where am I? You're safe. Your father's waiting for you. The signal came from nearby, I'm telling ya. Now, you were out hunting. How far did you go? Did you find a outpost or a village, anything like that? No, we don't know. I don't think so. There is nothing out there. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. They saved us. You look better already. It was a woman. When it comes to medicine, Lynn knows her stuff. Please. The water bottle? Our water is boiled and filtered. It's definitely purer than yours. Leave us. For our maestro hospitality is of upmost importance for new arrivals. This evening he will be happy to hear your story. As I was saying, today is a special day for us. Yeah, well, I'll be pleased to meet him. Thanks. If there's anything you need. Okay, they're not savages, but um, it's a small population and they call this their fortress. You know why? No scavengers have been able to bust into it. Do you trust these people? No. Trust 'em? I don't trust anyone, Lily, you know that. You think these people are strange? They've been living here for years. Ever since the world went crazy. Of course they're strange. They got this guide or something, it's like an organization, and it's allowed them to survive all this time. You know, everybody tries to find a way to survive. Do you trust me? You? No, you're still weak. Look, they got food, water, free food. They asked us to say, no obligation. So I figured we'd just stick around and we get back our strength, our stamina, and then I'll talk to their leader and maybe he can give us some information. And then we leave again tomorrow. Why can't we just talk to him today? No, we can't. He's in a... He's in kind of a place you... Are you sure? God damn it. We're dead, Lily. You, me, the baby. Let's just allow ourselves some time to live again. Maestro. Jesus, this world has gone crazy. He makes some strange speeches. If you ask me, he's the one who got his daughter pregnant. In any case, he's completely off his rocker. He's looking at us. Yeah, they say this maestro of theirs, he's always lived here. Even before the ruin. You believe that? I believe I'm hungry. Thank you. Thanks. One night I appeared to you all in a dream. Come to me, I told you, for have I have found the way of salvation and I christened this place in the name of our lord as Augustus did with his temple to Jupiter. We are the chosen people. Another year has past and the glow of our rebirth shows no sign of darkening. Though incarnated in this food that today we honor. It is always and only our faith that passes from our lips. The lord loves us and in order to continue our mission he has presented us with two new brothers. The girl is hungry. Let us eat. Uh, maestro, we- - I have spent much time in prayer so that you would come here. So many words expressed that I've exhausted them all. Allow me to replenish them. The beginning of a new civilization. Is that what the broadcast said? So, you were saying the radio belonged to a scavenger. No, it wasn't his, but he had it when he died. Maestro Abel, I understand your confusion, but we've come a long way traveling trying to find this outpost. From now we are now, I think it's just a couple of days more, a couple of days. So, I'd like to know if you have any information for us. Lynn, show them. No tongue, no taste. Such a shame. You see, Michael, you are my brother. You became so the moment you were led to me. I'm the elder here and it is my duty to protect you from disappointment. I will have told you I was born here. Well, I know this land and I can tell you that out there you'll find nothing. Nothing but the death and devastation that have already touched your family. Paradise you seek for your daughter is within these walls. In lands made fertile by the grace of our lord. How vast is your land? I mean, you can't control all of it. Your father lacks judgment, Lily. You are the hope of the new world and he wants to put you in danger. Let me see. Forgive us, we didn't mean to offend. We didn't mean to offend. We appreciate your hospital, it's uh, our hurry is just impatience. Look at this beautiful face of your daughter. It's dirty, it's worn out. Yet inside there something extraordinary's emerging. We may not look like much, but it is from here that humanity will rise again whether you believe it or not. Your arrival was a divine sign. Yeah, well, I stopped believing in God a long time ago. I'm surprised that someone like you dares make fun of our religion. We believe in something we can feel, perceive, and see. Whilst you believe in a place you've never seen guided by a voice you can no longer hear. Dad, Dad, Dad. Michael, beautiful stories are ones that have a happy ending. You told me one today and it did not have the ending I desired. The world comes to an end. He sent me Lily, and I cannot risk losing her. Don't just sit there, we must prepare everything. The world we knew has ended. But do not despair. Today is the dawn of a new era and we have the chosen one. Maestro, the mother has announced their arrival. Has the birthing begun? The stench this place emanates. Day by day it has seeped into the stone itself. But you won't be here long, I can assure you that. I'll kill you, huh. I'll fucking kill you. Where's my daughter? A woman possessing the gift of life and you want to take her away from us. I would never have allowed it. Come closer, both of you, huh? Both of ya. It's an ancient smell. Exuding all the history of my ancestors. For centuries, the same devotion, the same rights, the same emulation. You wouldn't understand. What'd you do with her, huh? You're important to us, Michael. You will support our community, you and your daughter, who I'm sure will appreciate your decision. Go to the mother. The moment has arrived. Yes, my lord. I must leave you, brother. But don't despair. Very soon I will take you inside me. Hey, come back. Go ahead. Hey. Hey, come here. Hey! Hey! Hey! What have you done to her? You stupid girl. Stop whining. Lynn? Lynn. Can you help us? Why won't they feed us? You have to give up on a little water if you want the plant to bud. Protection is repaid with sacrifice. The creature keeps us alive and in return it just wants its babies. We mothers shall provide them. That has always been the way. You're out of your mind. She does not have our luck. Her mouth is as dry as her breast. But she's perfect for satisfying the community. But children, children make you beautiful. Children sweeten the heart. My dear girl, don't fight it. Everything will be much easier. Faith. Don't fight. The day of the dark night has arrived. The ancient prophecies shall be fulfilled. The world will come to an end and the Lord will come amongst us humble servants and lead us to a new life. And before he's coming, we've been granted the honor of satiating him once more. Oh Lord, I invoke you on this night of solemn sacrifice. From the ashes I call your emissaries. Scourged by the injustice of the ignorant and the infidels so that through your intervention they may come to collect the gift we offer you. Her body is your body. Make her your devoted servant. The fervent vessel for your sacred passage. Here is the legitimate son. His limbs spawn the foundation of your divine impudence. The purity of his blood shall temper the blades of the emissaries to protect our fortress! Open the gates of fire and free your rightful knights from the darkness in which they were chained! May nothing impede their enterprise! His will shall be done. What is it? I don't know. What are you looking at? Pray! I implore you. Accept our unworthy gift. It is his wish. The lord has sent us another woman, we can still- We're not scared. What are they doing? - Let's get out of here! - No, no, no, no, no. - No, no, no. - Move! Somebody help me! Lily. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Dad! Dad! Dad! Don't touch me. Let me go! Do you know where my father is? I'm your servant. I've served our lord. I'm the great priest! The ritu... The ritual has not been completed. There was another pregnant woman. We can still offer her to the glory of- Take me to my daughter. Not so loud. They can't see us, but they can hear us. What the fuck are those things? The ceremony was interrupted. Things you don't understand. Yeah? Well, understand this. I want you to take me to Lily, you understand? We have to get out of here. I have the keys, so unless you want to die here... They're coming. Let me tell you this. You take me to her and we leave because I know where to go. I know there's nothing out there. We have to escape, we have no choice. Take me to her or I'm gonna fucking kill you like a dog, do you understand that? Fine. I'll show you, but we have to hurry. My father, is he alive? Where are we going? Wait, the backpack with the guy- What are you doing? It could be... What? Let me go! Lily! She's there. Lily! They've already been here. There's nothing more than you can do for your daughter. Oh, enough with this bullshit, huh. Where's my daughter? Stop it! Can't you see what's happening? You can't understand. You can't. What'd you do with her? Do you... The child was still born. Now they just want to punish us. What the fuck is he talking about? Your daughter is marked. But we can still make it. No. Lily's still alive and nobody's leaving until I find her! You're crazy. You've seen it with your own eyes. You can't stop them. Lily! Lynn, you're still alive. It's blocked. No. You know my daughter, I've seen you with her. - I saw you- - Stop! Tell me. She's captured. I'm sorry. We get off to get out of here while we still have time. No, no, I'm staying here. You do what you want, but I am leaving. You coming with me? Die if you want. You saw them and you know where they go. Hey! Stop! Stop! Please. Please. Take me to her. Take me to her. Go. Get away from her, you bastard! Dad? Wait here. Lily, go. Run! Run! You son of a bi- So. So, we arrived. There's nothing! No. I'm tired of walking. Please. Don't hurt me. Please. Please help me. Who are you? Please. Did Abel send you here to kill me? We left the sect. We want to start again. And start a community. The grand epidemic, it decimated us. This place is no different to anywhere else. We have never been safe. Then they attacked us. The earth is not dead. Whoever can hear this message, join me at Paradise. Latitude 45.768. Those who survived, they went back with them to worship their god just to stay alive. My father believed that if we got here. There's nothing here. We hoped. But that madman was right. Now there's nothing else but them. Dead. They're all dead. So, this is the dawning of a new humanity. You have the mark. You, you are the mother. No, they disappeared. You have the mark. They will come back to claim their child. You cannot escape them. That you are baring is no longer your child. - Longitude 9.563. - You. The land here is still alive. And them. - We have water, food. - Are the future. - To save them. - Join us. Please. - Be their mother. - This radio signal is powered by a renewable energy source and will continue to be transmitted in loop. We are here to welcome you. Who's there? My baby! My baby! No. My baby. My baby! My baby. My baby.
