Like a child leaning on the shoulder Like tears lingering on the face You're like an angel Lending me a shoulder, giving me strength People Life Ocean Wild Hair shampoo brings you a prosperous life and voluminous hair. The Fifth Squad's sweeping popularity continues to rage on. Lots of people are playing the claw machines to grab their limited edition action figure. Who's your favorite in the Fifth Squad? Of course, it's our Mini Ming! Stop asking me questions. You keep asking me. Right, indeed. That's true. The five of them grew up eating my noodles. They are very smart and always got first place in exams. Stop interviewing me. I don't want to be famous. Back then, they were so skinny like... The Fifth Squad is cutting the ribbon at an animal hospital today. Let's go to the live scene. It's a great honor to have the most handsome Fifth Squad member to cut the ribbon for me. - Thank you for your support. - This is what we should do. - Is this a puppy? - Well, this isn't a puppy. This is Hell Kitty, a cat from hell. - Hell Kitty. - I see. They were unknown for a very long time. This is their first time on the show. Kangsi Coming Again is honored to have them. Let's welcome the five superheroes, the Fifth Squad. - Welcome. - Long time no see. When was the last time we had hot pot together? Time flies. I kind of miss you. How have you been? LIFE IS LIMITED, BUT THERE ARE UNLIMITED WAYS TO WRITE YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY. We have changed so much after all this while. Where should we start? I know that you'll definitely enjoy it by starting from here. Sit tight. We are about to begin. Do you think we're running a concert here? Are you guys there already? Stop nagging. It's annoying. Damn, we've been here for ages! For me, fighting means fighting fire with fire. MINI MING AKA GUAN YOU, DRUMMER I found a hundred-dollar note. There's no need to feel anxious about this kind of battle. Hey. How's your situation over there? There are so many people. It's as if we're in a mosh pit. Then just think of it as a concert. Me and my last persistence Get ready! Sing! Hello, sir? Sir, hello? - Sir! - Zip it. - What time is the hot pot reservation? - Five o'clock. Call them and postpone it. Do I look like I have time now? Hey. I want to have hot pot! Do you have time for it now? Damn, cheap stuff is bad. Let's change tonight's dinner to skewered aliens. Stone! It's done. Let's just stick to hot pot. Check out my lethal blow. We're all determined To get crazy until dawn We are born to be I'm serious This can't wait This can't be compromised There have already been Too many compromises made in life Hey party animal Don't look for a way out If you can't dance Then don't dance Swaying is good too Just close your eyes And play your air guitar Hey party animal Don't back down You're not alone You have a room full of friends here So let's get crazy And celebrate Don't want to be a pet I'd rather be a monster We're all determined To get crazy until dawn We are born to be Party animals Just be stupid for once And do something spontaneous We're all determined To get crazy until dawn We are born to be Party animals Party animals Close your eyes, just close your eyes Ask yourself Out of countless ordinary days Which one was the best day of your life? And then What was the worst day of them all? Perhaps it gave you something That changed your mind And you planted a rose on a barren planet In a jail cell, listening to music You have just started a concert Form a sports team with your blind dates And go win the world cup Maybe that was the day The best day The best of days Grand or humble Eternal or ephemeral Hindrance in the mortal world They are relative You miss yesterday Or look forward to tomorrow Or any Still breathing, still surviving To live the best of today When a wall stands Only to obstruct all yearnings for freedom When faith no longer stands against The war and famine all around When faith no longer stands against The war and famine all around Amidst the chaos at Lan Ling The heavens and earth separate As all is forgotten I fear not a nameless grave But more grief in the world The night is still long And dawn has not yet broken I'm on a battlefield of survivors All I hope is to see the face I miss most once more in this lifetime My tears have not yet dried And my heart is still warm What is it that continues to boil within? This song of battle Accompanies my arrogance with no regrets The boundless hatred is unforgettable And unforgivable All these demons cannot be silenced Or eliminated Starving children, homeless peasants Who is stealing from us all? A thousand years later You and I are still stuck in the pen The night is still long And dawn has not yet broken I'm on a battlefield of survivors All I hope is to see the face I miss most once more in this lifetime My tears have not yet dried And my heart is still warm What is it that continues to boil within? Who sings this song of battle alone When surrounded by enemies on all sides The night has ended and dawn has broken Daylights floods out the stars Just like us, soon-to-be Buried in the torrential flood of history When the world has forgotten Who my blood once boiled for Entering battle For aspirations of what should have been If the world were attacked by cruelty All I need is a phone booth I can wear my underpants as my outfit If you can be happy Unfold the cloak I'll take you flying Who blesses me with this Helpless power No one can stop Your desire to depart Why is saving the Earth So effortless And yet so little can be done For the love between you and me Why is saving the Earth Finally achieved with a perfect ending? Why can I only Watch love burns to ashes If the world were attacked by cruelty Who can take over my superpower? NOT CRAZY, BUT CRAZIER AWESOME SUPERHEROES' SELFIE SUPERHEROES DRAW CRITICISM FOR MAKING A HUGE MESS We were trying to be good, but we ended up being the bad guys. We thought we could be superheroes, but we found out that we can't even manage to be ordinary. In this large corporation called Life, fate is our big boss. Though we can't pick our own life and fate, we're lucky that we still have this group of good colleagues and buddies who mock each other. Hey, how long have we been fired? Damn. Who knows? Since the year we got rid of the aliens, our budget has been cut to the bone. Where can we find jobs at this age? I don't even have the money to buy milk for my baby. Gosh, world peace. But we lost our job instead. Heroes are useless anyway. Shang-yi, can you teach me how to play snooker? Call me coach. Gosh. Luckily, I majored in art. I can still work with aesthetic things. Come on. Beautiful undergarments. Buy one big, get one small free. - Buy one big, get one small free. - Hey, don't push. Buy one big, get one small free. Everyone can have them. Sir, I want the 399-dollar one. ORIGINAL PRICE: 1,799 DOLLARS SPECIAL OFFER: 399 DOLLARS - I want five of these. - But... The record store was doing just fine. It's all thanks to you, lousy Masa. You purchased a bunch of unpopular albums. Hey, what are you talking about? These are all classics, all right? This... Hey, why is there one missing? Hey. You're being paranoid. Hey. Now this is a classic. Come on. Pink Floyd is the real classic. Hey, guys. Show some respect. This is the real classic. - That's a classic? - What is it? - This can't be a classic! - It's so ugly. - It can never be this. - Let me tell you. Enough! Whether it's a classic or not, everyone has their own different opinion. That's because you have your own memories. I have my own biography. As long as it's touching, it is a classic. Fine, you're right. Just like spicy hot pot, shabu-shabu, spicy sausage stew, and cheese fondue. They are all good for winter. That's true. Back in high school, because of spicy hot pot, I got into a fight with my music teacher because we were arguing - if Michael Jackson is a classic. - Right. And we all skipped classes to go to concerts. Those who go to concerts seem like crazy people. People in the mosh pit area... People in the bleachers, are you crazy? The audience, are you all crazy? Hey. Who are you talking to? You're still alive? LIFE CO., LTD. CHIEF HUANG Crying in the crowd All you want is to turn transparent You no longer dream Or hurt or love You have already decided You hold it in quietly Holding yesterday tightly in your fists Yet the memories are The more they hurt The more they leave A criss-cross of shallow And deep cuts in your palms You are not truly happy Your smile is just the camouflage you wear I stand to your left But we're a galaxy apart Must we really Hold on to our regrets until our old age And then feel a deep remorse? You are not truly happy Your smile is just the camouflage you wear You have decided not to hate And not to love Shutting your soul In a shell forever locked You deserve to be truly happy You should shed the camouflage you wear Why is it that after losing everything The punishment continues? Can all the sadness end in this moment And life begin anew Good evening! Good evening! We are... Mayday! Welcome to Mayday's Life Tour! Welcome! I would like to join you out there and feel it. We want to feel the feeling of standing in the drizzling rain. Hey, I can feel it. - Really? - I can feel it. - Feel what? - Are you starting to feel it? - I feel it. - Guan You got it up quickly. And you're feeling it now? I mean he got his arm up. No, I just said I can feel it. Well, what are you feeling? I feel that we can have a rehearsal for the countdown. Just a rehearsal, okay? Those in the mosh pit area, is that okay? Those in the bleachers, are you ready? If you're ready, then let's... The feeling is gone. - What? - What? Are you for real? - What? - Well, it really depends on the feeling. - If you have no feeling... - Sorry. So, what now that the feeling is gone? Let's discuss it with our emperor. It's fine, we can count on our coordination. - Hold on. - It's an F key. Those on-stage don't know what we're up to. Let's just depend on our coordination then. Wait a minute. - Hold on. - What now? You're feeling it again? No, the rhythm we just sang. That's our song, "Garbage Truck." - Right. - Is it a fast or slow song? I saw some of the audience going left and right, and some going back and forth. They are not in unison. - We didn't explain. - It was not clear. No one is leading. - Right, no one is leading. - Ashin, you should lead them. We'll guide them, so they will make the same moves. - I see. - Okay. Let's do jumping jacks for this song. Why? - Go on. - Demonstrate. - Show us. - Monster, I want to see it. Monster, I want to see it. - Please? - Give me the microphone. - Come on. - No. The guitar is important. Check it out. "Garbage Truck" with jumping jacks. - Okay, Mr. Chou. Please begin. - Go ahead, Mr. Chou. Just play it. I think you can do squat jumps as well. - Masa was trained. - Masa! - Come on, let Masa do it. - Masa! - Do some squat jumps. - Masa! Masa! Play it, sir. I felt tricked after saying that... That will do. Okay, we're done with the squat jumps. Guan You will do the push-ups. Get ready. - Enough! - Okay. - Stone, get ready for sit-ups. - Get ready. One person left. Ashin! My stomach hurts. Well... - It's your turn. - Well... No, sorry. Mayday hereby apologizes to you. If we keep doing this, we'll still be here when people celebrate the New Year tomorrow. We'll be stuck here and our concert won't end. Well then, how about we sing one more song? Okay? Yes! Maybe one of these days Time will really turn back Turn back for you and me Those easy days that we can't go back to Perhaps there'll be a day That really marks the end of the world We'll propose a toast With the nectar brewed from our memories Bottoms up with you If I had to choose a scene That represent youth What comes to mind are the tears Blue sky, and that year at graduation When we were crying, laughing Hugging, and your face Fills me with love, longing, song And tears but I miss it so Longing always comes all of a sudden With no forewarning When memories break free From the test papers And bust past the years before my eyes You and I are covered in sweat, Drinking soda by the field We agreed that no matter what Together, we would walk To the world of the future Now the world of the future is here Why is it that your side and my side Don't belong to the same side? Our vow of friendship Was as strong as Noah's ark But as I look out at the sea, waiting My vision is forever blurred Maybe one of these days Time will really turn back Turn back for you and me Those easy days that we can't go back to Perhaps there'll be a day That really marks the end of the world We'll propose a toast With the nectar brewed from our memories Bottoms up with you Bought a car, a watch A camera over the years But something is unreachable And unstoppable Life is full of compromise, So just get drunk We're only left with less emotion With no maturity Maturity is a wake-up call, an endurance But the dreams keep fading along the way Sometimes, there's an urge to cry But there are no tears Hoping you or they would hold a reunion He's waiting for you You're waiting for me But who am I waiting for? Which kids are still awake? Whose phones are dead In no mood to join The day goes dark And bright and dark again The time is flying by But we have no strength to catch up Maybe one of these days Time can really turn back Turn back for you and me Those easy days that we can't go back to Perhaps there'll be a day That really marks the end of the world We'll propose a toast With nectar brewed from our memories Bottoms up with you Eventually, that one day We'll all become yesterday And you're the one with me Once in a lifetime Through the fleeting mortal world There will be such a day, that is today Today is that day Telling you the gratitude I kept to myself And drink a toast to it together Drink a toast to eternity Drink it and live forever Through the ages and times The time has stopped They've all returned Those you have missed Waiting for your arrival The time has stopped They've all returned Those you have missed Waiting for your arrival The time has stopped They've all returned Those you have missed Waiting for your arrival Booze and beats, we're rocking and rolling So what if I fall next to you Each time I mess up by your side We go like That's the way Only you know that I pretend to be normal Only I admire all your evil behaviors We're each other's bad bromance and karma The perfect Gang of scoundrels That's the way of being brothers I collect your every embarrassing moment That's the way of being brothers The charts of our absurdities It's hard to forget When everyone else Time after time after time Is disappointed in me One after another after another Is leaving me My brother I look up and see you by my side Can we always Keep on and on Talking nonsense And keep talking and talking Until the sunrise My brother The craziest time in life You're there all along My brother The best time in life Is being brothers with you LIFE CO., LTD. You punched in with a cry Baby in Delivery Room Do you still recall everyone's blessings?

Life Co., Ltd. Never take a day off LIFE CO., LTD. Life Co., Ltd.? We have many problems in life. Look for me and you'll have no problems. What? I can do plumbing. I also teach calligraphy. I do valet parking. I'm also good at flirting. I mean tuning the piano. What's this? Life's beautiful ginseng. It's good for your health. Live a beautiful and earnest life. Goodness, your ginseng is too spicy. I want to return the purchase. Sorry, the number you've dialed is not in service. Please check and dial again. It's not in service. Please check and dial again. Is this the so-called ginseng? Hey, isn't this ginger? Sir, are you scamming for money? Hey, buddy. Don't make it sound so bad. It requires money to protect the earth. "Protect the earth"? Since the parliament canceled the Fifth Squad's budget, I can only raise money by running this company. Sir, you barely escaped death back then. Running a limited liability company and leading a limited life is not bad at all. If I give up just like that, how am I supposed to face the predecessors who died defending Earth? What I'm telling you is that life is limited, but a lot of things are unlimited. What are they? Endless bills and mortgage, breakups, naughty kids, hard-to-get tickets, and indefensible world peace. Step aside. When I barely escaped death, I collected a lot of information in secret. A huge and fierce monster was discovered in the asteroid belt outside the rim of the earth. Here, this is how it looks like. 500,000 WORDS WERE OMITTED So, I earnestly request you to protect the earth again. Hey, I am talking to you guys. Chief.

I have found the enemy's weakness. It is extremely sensitive to sound. And what a coincidence. I also found this. How was it? It was awful, right? It's so awful. Listen, let's put this in a rocket and launch it into its ear. - That will definitely destroy it. - Sounds great. - Hurry then. - Right, launch the rocket. Guys, please take a look in the mirror. Tell me what you see. Five losers? Right. There are six losers including me. Where can we get a rocket? But... You've got five lives. Why don't we just put our lives on the line? Seven billion. The death toll is estimated to be seven billion. Are you just going to sit and watch all these people's lives disappear? Life is limited, but a biography can be written in unlimited ways. It depends on how you write it. Hey. Our record store is in the danger zone. I'm in. Find a chord and start singing The forgotten time in the story It began from an ordinary growth Or the looks of the youths When they first learned guitar The stage that year No applause, no spotlight Along the rim of a basin Too stubborn to give in Arguing and reasoning At rehearsal for days Devour anxiety of no retreat with volume Is there light at the end of darkness? Would it be bright when the night ends? Is it hopeful to become famous? Or just ignorant arrogance? Then what would it be? Then what would it be? Singing regularly in pubs Getting to know the normality of humanity Feeling the pressure of music festivals Finding that battles Require guns and supplies A dream is to make blood And sweat into a stew Pouring it on the dry and poor reality When the weight of daily trivia Holds us down We only realize it when we're down In the vast wilderness Hope begins to blossom Through the rock-n-roll or sugarcoat Tacky or ideal, criticize or sing along Only look afar, To the farthest on the road The promised land, keep bashing So many faces are seen So many towns are traveled The young man is old and weary Looking back, where am I standing? Straying from a stop after stop All the hotels and airports Interview after interview, back and forth Eyes after eyes that are staring Like prisons and high walls Are the scenes Within like how we've imagined? Is there light at the end of darkness? Would it be bright when the night ends? Is it glamorous to become famous? Or just a flame of frenzy? Then what would it be? Then what would it be? I dreamed of the time We jumped over the wall Mandrakes blossomed along the road Walking through The bizarre life in bare feet The rooftop after school Like a crowded arena Never think too much, just a leap of faith The young man looks back Smiles and tells me to keep up The beginning of the road, who can forget? The end of the road, who is singing? Who will be famous? Who will be disappointed? But there's more that are just hoping Is there light at the end of darkness? The day will be bright when the night ends Who will be famous? Regardless of the truth If you keep believing What can they do? What can they do? You will be able to fly You will be able to fly Waking up at an unfamiliar place The lens become guns and blades The whispers become the truth The guitar leaves the shoulder The poet leaves the frontier We live in a gigantic studio The lucky kids have climbed on heaven Tasting the fruits of success And consequence The innocent kids, have they changed? The intense billboard The bustling award show I often get lost in the rhythm When humanity becomes the market When the market becomes the battlefield How many ideals Has the battlefield buried? Recalling the ideals, the slim hope Walking on a wire, my inner strength Greatness and disguise, dust or glory Only a fine line in between Or a ray of hope Every lonely sunrise, I sing alone Silently letting the melody Echo with my heart Even if no one sings with me one day At least in my heart There is still an undisturbed place We are in fact all the same Unknown but full of indescribable desires Waiting to shine once in a lifetime Rather get hurt than feel sad The scars would become my badge Pin it on my heart and never forget Pin it on my heart and never forget Every lonely sunrise, I sing alone Silently letting the melody Echo with my heart Even if no one sings with me one day At least in my heart I am applauding to myself Every lonely sunrise, I sing alone Silently letting the melody Echo with my heart Even if no one sings with me one day At least in my heart There is still an undisturbed place Like the children The soil that wouldn't rot Sing again Sing again "CONTENTMENT" LYRICS / MUSIC: ASHIN How can one own a rainbow? How can one embrace an entire gust During the summer? Stars in the sky make fun of people below For never understanding Never feeling content What if I fell in love with your smile? How could I treasure it? How could I make it mine? If you're happy but it's not because of me Maybe letting go is truly all I can have When a wind sweeps a kite up into the sky I will pray for you A blessing and I am moved Finally, as your form vanishes In a sea of people I realize that tears shed with a smile Are the ones that hurt the most Twinkle, twinkle little star How I wonder what you are? When a wind sweeps a kite up into the sky I will pray for you A blessing and I am moved Finally, as your form vanishes In a sea of people I realize that tears shed with a smile Are the ones that hurt the most What if I fell in love with your smile? How could I treasure it? How could I make it mine? If you're happy but it's not because of me Maybe letting go is truly all I can have The joy of contentment Has me enduring This heartache Wake up before midnight and feel confused The stars forget to shine We are children, just children Born on this ship They talk about the ark like a small boat The whispers flee the deck The storm shakes the flag pole People cut down mountains and trim clouds Turn them into thousands Of paddles and sails Searching, screaming For the unseen future What future will we sail into? Countless fates reincarnating Forming countless and different compasses When the tidal waves come crashing down Our hands are parted, hearts defeated Every person Every heart The storm Is fleeing The gods have left And the ghosts are partying Humans are struggling Who was born into the wrong bloodline? The wrong color? Who dreamed of the wrong expectations? Straying on the vast ocean Is not loneliness The darkest of the night Is not yet the darkest But the never-ending fights between humans Pushes us to the two ends of the spectrum The heretic, the extreme and lost regrets What future will we sail into? Countless fates reincarnating Forming countless and different compasses If only you and I were left in the world Why do people still Argue about the future And trashing the present? How should we cherish the present? Countless intertwining autobiographies Meeting on the vast ocean When you look up The thousands of gradient wonders Has started shining At the end of the night The cloud The ray of light Like a crown Whispering in the sunshine Relaxed as the ocean You move toward me Who said greatness Comes from being gigantic? We exist as we are Going through torment in order to shine If love is not just a fantasy "TOUGH" LYRICS / MUSIC: ASHIN I live in the future That you fantasized about The enthusiasm and impulsiveness Have now cooled down Your tough expression Disappears in the mirror Leaving only traces of the passage of time Every heart's belief, each person's fate The individual in every story Repeatedly asks themselves All that you've conceded over the years Do you ever sigh thinking about it? What are the things That you will never give up? Again and again You've swallowed the tears Again and again You've pieced together your broken self Day after day, do you still believe in The tough version of you that's living Within the depths of your heart? "PETER AND MARY" You chase and you breathe Your arrogant stubbornness You've cried until Your eyes and nose were swollen You've forgotten Like nothing has ever happened If you could have predicted The traps on this road I think you would still enjoy Making the mistakes The places you've walked Are called footprints The places you can't get to Are called longing You've learned to pack your rebellion Learn to hide your expressions Taking off this mask I want to say thank you Thank you for being with me Throughout the journey Again and again You've swallowed the tears Again and again You've pieced together your broken self Day after day, do you still believe in The tough version of you that's living Within the depths of your heart? The things that you believed back then Will become a beautiful scenery today Each time I hesitate, I won't forget The tough version of me That's living deep inside my heart "TOUGH" - We need to eat before protecting Earth. - I'm hungry. Order takeout then. - Order takeout. - Okay. - Exactly. - Get someone to deliver. What's wrong? Let's go. - My goodness. - Hey. Where are you going? - Aren't we ordering takeout? - Yes. Don't bother. Let's go for hot pot with this today. Close your eyes, just close your eyes Ask yourself Out of countless ordinary days Which one was the best day of your life? - What's up? - I'm not as rigid as I used to be. What? I mean my hands. I see. The best day The best of days Do you miss yesterday? Or look forward to tomorrow? Still breathing, still surviving Every best of today IT HAS TO BE COOL! It's time to take action!

Chief Huang, Director Huang! Thank you, everyone. Thanks. Thanks! "PEOPLE LIFE, OCEAN WILD" LYRICS / MUSIC: ASHIN One day, I was wondering What am I exactly Or am I, after all Nothing at all Without a purpose every day Yet I often try to prove The truth is out there Everyone else is farting From their bottoms I keep saying I want A revolution every day Even the whole world Has abandoned me At least I get to decide to be happy Or sad for myself So I say Just let it go I know the tide will go up After going down What's the big deal? SUPERHEROES DRAW CRITICISM BUDGET'S ALL GONE SUPERHEROES ARE IN TROUBLE I often give it my all With all I've got Yet hardly making a difference But I've never feared To dig out my burning heart There is a coin in my hand If it's tail then I would give up Damn it, but deep in my heart I don't want to give up at all Even the whole world Has abandoned me At least I get to be happy Or sad on my own So I say Just let it go I know the tide will go up After going down What's the big deal? I often close my eyes And hear the breath of the ocean, it's you The gentle blue tides Telling me it's all right Even the whole world Has abandoned me At least I get to decide to be happy Or sad for myself So I say Just let it go I know the tide will go up After going down I can't forget No matter where my tomorrow Will be heading toward At least I get to decide to be happy Or sad for myself So I say Just let it go I know the tide will go up After going down What's the big deal? What's the big deal? Where will I be tomorrow? Where will I be tomorrow? I forgot to introduce you to my old friend. Life is limited, but friendship is unlimited. MAYDAY LIFE TOUR UNLIMITED MAYDAY, THANK YOU WORK OVERTIME, HONG KONG WORK OVERTIME Work overtime! EXEMPT EMPLOYEE Work overtime! WORK OVERTIME Work overtime! OVERTIME Work overtime! WORK OVERTIME NO DAY OFF Work overtime! WORK OVERTIME WORK OVERTIME Work overtime! Work overtime! WORK OVERTIME IMPERIAL EDICT Work overtime! What do you think? Even though you're not here I still want to ask you The air can't speak on your behalf Habit is like an obstinate wound That never heals When I think about it It would tear up my soul Having the photos for you to keep And make an extra copy The sweater has one more layer for you too But the warmth to comfort you When you're alone How am I to save one more of it for you? I wouldn't want to leave you alone Floating alone in the crowd I wouldn't want you to walk alone At the time of stormy rains I wouldn't want to leave you alone To experience the cruelty of the world I wouldn't want you to be in tears Until eternity Perhaps in the future, you will find Someone that understands you And cherishes you The journey up ahead You have to be happier and content I wouldn't want to leave you alone Floating alone in the crowd I wouldn't want you to walk alone At the time of stormy rains I wouldn't want to leave you alone To experience the cruelty of the world I wouldn't want you to be in tears Until eternity What do you think? Even though you're not here I still want to ask you It's just because I'm already used to The satisfaction in your eyes My only one last unreasonable demand Is hoping you would have a happy life I'm only asking that fate Brings you to a whole new journey Dashing to the realm of happiness Don't look back, just keep going Please forget I am still Alone "FINAL CHAPTER" LYRICS: ASHIN, MUSIC: STONE It's the final chapter Of the autobiography Seen all the glamour in the destiny Blurry pupils, dried skins They had once been so flourishing Pick one of your favorite photos Who was beside you During these millions of moments I was like you in that year Flying Unsettling and unable to forget But still, I have to open my palms Whose warmth did I hold on to? It's getting cold Is there someone somewhere Waiting for me to go back to what I was? When my cheeks were smooth And the nights were cool The world was crazy and love was blooming Is there someone by my side Listening to me talking about The long life ahead? In your eyes, I seem to be forgetful It's because in my mind I already have the one The one who is the hardest to forget In my times There were still record stores Like a museum, filled with hope Beatles and Guns n' Roses, love and sorrow Always singing with pride Success is like a sand castle And life is a wave The waves would flush away All the illusions Savings and houses, struggles and desires Becoming empty Memories are like windows Cold tears in the eyes The scenery is blurred as if I'm in heaven The lonely big bed Who comes near my face Is someone recalling the past With a smile too? Fumbling and reckless, looking so foolish The most common days The most humble dreams When do we find out What's worth cherishing? Is someone there to tell me the truth? Time is the biggest lie What seems to be usual, is impermanent The actualization of life is only Illusions This is the final chapter Of my autobiography Spending a lifetime To write this long poem The body is freed of pills and empty room I walk back to the light from the crib Is someone there who knows the place? I can go back and be with my love Kids are all busy, just let them be When I'm gone, just pretend I'm flying Flying in freedom When I'm different From the rest of the world Then just let me be so Persistence to me Is fighting fire with fire If I compromise myself If I lie to myself Although others may forgive me I would never forgive myself The most beautiful wish Must also be the craziest I am my own God Where I am alive Actually, seeing you today, the feelings in my heart seem to have become a bit different. It's 2018 and... And everyone seems to be a year older. No? I guess not. It's because I know that Mayday's fans somehow never grow up. Just like the guys onstage. Stone. Guan You. Masa. Monster. We have known each other since we were teenagers. Look at them. After tonight, you'll discover from their behavior and actions that their mental age is similar to a teenager. How great would it be to stay that way? If... If we don't have to live in a world of grown-ups, how nice would that be? But what has passed is past. The future is inevitable. We are here in 2018. We are here now. Perhaps in your life, you feel that it's different from what you've imagined. "Why is my future like this?" "Why did I grow up to be someone different from what I've imagined?" There's a young girl over there. Do you want to grow up faster? Do you? The adults beside her all shook their hands and said no. Actually, growing up is really fun. Because you'll have a bunch of friends. Like Mayday. They are a bit silly and immature. You'll have a good life. You'll have an exciting romance. Of course, your dad won't like it. The world of grown-ups is great. Even if it doesn't seem so great at times, it's all right. When you put on your headphones and listen to Mayday's songs, Mayday will always be with you like a 20-year-old. Mayday will always be with you like a 20-year-old! We're now in 2018! Even though we've become grown-ups, we're grown-ups who can carry burdens. We are grown-ups with a child living in us. Thank you all. Happy New Year. Happy New Year! Thank you! Happy New Year! Me and my last persistence Hold on tightly with both hands And never let go Is the next stop heaven or not? Despite the disappointment, do not despair Me and my proud persistence I sing loudly in the wind This one time I'll be crazy for myself Just this one time, me and my Persistence That's right, don't worry if you love me My stubbornness is kind The dirtier my hands get The more my eyes shine You don't care about my past You see my wings You said a phoenix only appears Where there has been a fire Being upwind is better for flying I'm not afraid of the opposition Of ten million people Only of my own surrender Me and my last persistence Hold on tightly with both hands And never let go Is the next stop heaven or not? Despite the disappointment, do not despair Me and my proud persistence I sing loudly in the wind This one time I'll be crazy for myself Just this one time Me and my persistence Just this one time, let me sing out loud Despite the disappointment, do not despair Just this one time, me and my Despite the disappointment, do not despair Just this one time Me and my persistence Is it boiling? Have you parked your ride? I have. - What is this? - Parking a plane like this. - The road doesn't belong to you. - What's going on? What's going on? YESTERDAY SNACK STALL Is it boiling or not? Almost. Don't we have to wait for the chief? The chief is with his superior and his superior's superior. They are attending the celebration of their superior. Could it be that they are having lobster and Wagyu beef hot pot at their celebration banquet? Come on. Here. The best kind of hot pot is when you're eating with your friends. Well? It's boiling. - Hurry up. Cook whatever you want. - Okay. Come on. Throughout your life, how many hot pots have you had? Spicy sausage stew, cheese fondue, lobster and Wagyu beef hot pot. The ones that you will never forget are always the people, not the hot pot. This movie is coming to an end. Maybe lives come to an end as well. But thank you for giving me your selfless companionship and endless sentiment in the story of my limited life. By the way, which band was it who sang that awful bomb song? It's Mayday. Hurry up and finish it. I'm going to close the stall. Hey, we made the headlines. Holy shit. We got fired. Aren't we ordering takeout? Don't bother. Let's go for hot pot with this today. We're in the high-tech cockpit now. It's really impressive. A turbocharger. - Hey, don't press it. - Do you know how to fly a plane? Come on, flying a plane is just like playing a video game. What's with the fuss? Come on. It's time to take action! Damn, it's more than 40 times the height of Taipei 101. Does that make it 4,041 times bigger, then? News flash. The retired Fifth Squad stood up and saved the earth again. They successfully defeated the fierce monster. - Hey. - Hello. You guys are eating here too? Yes. Join us. Sure. Cheers! - Cheers! - Hey, the plane is going to be towed away. We just saved the world, we're... - Shut up. Show me your license first. - License... - You have it, right? - License... - What about other IDs? - Other IDs... Do you have it? I have a microchip implant, will it do? Hey, don't tow the plane! I told you I have a microchip implant! One, two, three. Actually, I am a huge fan of yours. Can I have an autograph? On the wall? Well, on my body. Sure! Say hi to your parents. Mom, I'm on television. Look over here. - Hey, look. It's the real deal. - Hey. Kevin Tsai and Dee Hsu look just like they do on television. - That's true. - Right? Hey, will she touch my muscles? - Pervert. - Hey, we have a customer. Are you buying all of these? This is my son's band. Please show some support. - I see, a fellow band player. - Yes. Perfect timing! - Now, with just 49 dollars... - Just 49 dollars, you can take this album home as well. Well, what do you think? It's 49 dollars. Ashin! To tell you the truth, I have acrophobia. Flying here and there like this every day is really stressful. I totally understand. But I'm a veterinarian. LIFE BRAND BEAUTIFUL GINSENG Hi, Fifth Squad. The orphanage has received your donation. Thank you so much. Have a nice day. My heart feels the weight of life And fears to make a move I'm not a good person nor a bad person Just someone who dreams a lot I don't want to swim with the current Like a boat without an anchor I don't want to be a cunning And sneaky person I'd rather just be a fool I'm not empty-headed I'm not a good-for-nothing What should people do in their lives To enjoy every moment? I have my path and my dream The world that I dreamed of Is it truly just a fantasy? Of all the road I've taken, I'm hoping Hoping the words we've exchanged Would be cherished until someday Seeing all the fortunes Without having any of it Circumstances can fool you Without the background and the talent Just losing every competition Got to see through the vanity Get over the obstacles And the pouring rain Gather the courage to face my dream And just be a fool I'm not empty-minded I'm not a good-for-nothing What should people do in their lives To enjoy every moment? I have my path and my dream The world that I dreamed of Is it truly just a fantasy? - Of the road I've taken - I'm hoping Hoping the words we've exchanged Would be cherished until someday I have my path and my dream The world that I dreamed of Is it truly just a fantasy? Of the road I've taken, I'm hoping Hoping the words we've exchanged Would be cherished until someday I know that there will be a someday Let me hear your voice Let me hear your voice Life is formed by many glimpses of moments. Mayday wants to tell you this. In a fleeting moment, the one who once stood in front of me as a taunting junior, Masa, is now a father to a set of twins. The one who was once a prodigal son, Stone, is now a mature and prudent man. The one who took care of us like a big brother, Guan You, is still like a big brother to us. The one who always urges us to practice, to write and record songs, our leader, Mr. Monster, is still a responsible tough guy with a heavy burden. And I... And I... I am still like how I used to be. The one who likes to dream and always brags. The once... young man. But... I'm not young anymore. You're the young ones. Really. In a glimpse, more than 20 years have gone by for us. In a glimpse, we've become middle-aged men. I don't know when exactly it was when you first heard of Mayday. If possible, please close your eyes now. Try to recall the first time you heard of Mayday. Do you still remember the you from back then? All lives are like a fleeting moment. We might not be able to come up with a good new year's resolution, but we know that in the future, we can try even harder to seize every fleeting moment. Mayday will be there with you, so that you can have the best background music in your fleeting moment. Be it when you're falling out of love, losing your job, having a hard time, or being upset. Of course, you will also have great times like right now. All your friends are here with you. Mayday will be there with you in every fleeting moment. If you ever feel lonely in the future, then just sing this melody in your heart. You know it. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Mayday!
