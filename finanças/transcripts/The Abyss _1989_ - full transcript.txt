[ Sonar Beeping ] [Choir Vocalizing *] * 60 knots? No way, Barnes. The Reds don't have anything that fast. Checked it twice. I mean, it's a real unique signature-- No cavitation, no reactor noise. It doesn't even sound like screws. [Humming] What the hell is it? I'll tell you what it's not. It's not one of ours. Sir, contact changing to heading 214. Speed... 80 knots. 80 knots. Still diving. Depth, 900... Still diving. Depth, 900 feet. Port clearance, 150 feet from the cliff wall, sir. It's getting tight in here. Yeah? We can still give them a haircut. Helm, come right to 069er, down 5 degrees. Coming right 069er, down 5 degrees, aye. Portside clearance, 120 feet. Narrowing to 75. Sir, we have a proximity warning light. It's too damn close. We've got to back off. Sir, range to contact, 200. Contact just jigged to bearing 260 and accelerated to... to 130 knots, sir. Nothing goes 130. Sir, range to contact, 100 yards. 80 yards, sir! 60! It's turbulence. We're in its wake. Helm, all stop. Full right rudder. Hydraulics failure. Planes not responding, sir. Hydraulics restored, sir. Oh, my God. Collision alarm! Collision alarm! Fire control to sonar! Let's get out of here! Lighten her up, Charlie! Torpedo room is flooded, sir! Blow all tanks! Blow all the tanks! Blow everything! All back full! Answering. All back full. Give me a damage report. What's our depth? Passing 1,400, sir. Main's forward tanks are ruptured! Still descending, sir. 1,450. Passing 1,500, sir. Still descending. We're too deep to pump auxiliary. Passing 1,550. Still descending, sir. We're losing her. Passing 1,600, sir, and still descending. Launch the buoy. Passing 1,650. Passing 1,700, sir. Launching! Aah! Aah! [Beeping] Benthic Explorer. Salvor 1 on final. Over. Copy you, Salvor 1. This is Benthic Explorer. You're cleared to land. Hey! Yeah? They're coming. This, uh, could get pretty ugly. Yeah. It does not look good at all. Oh, no! Look who's with them. Queen bitch of the universe. Sonny, how you doing? I got two more welds on this bypass valve. No light from the surface. How deep are they? McBride? 1,700 feet. I need them to go below 2,000. No problem. They can do that. So that's it? You just cheerfully turn the whole thing over to the goon squad? Look, I was told to cooperate. I'm cooperating. Kirkhill, you're pathetic. Get Brigman on the line. Hippy, get me Bud. Catfish. Yeah. Get them old buns up here and give me a hand. Hang on. I'll be up there in a second. Hey, you guys are milking that job. Yeah. It's because we love freezing our butts off out here for you so much. Hey, Bud! Yeah. Hippy's on the bitch box! It's a call from topside. Benthic company man. Kirkhill? Yeah. That guy don't know his butt from a rat hole. Hey, Harry, do me a favor, will you? Square away this mud hose. Get rid of some of these empty sacks. This place is starting to look like my apartment. You got it, boss. Bud, pick up the topside line. It's urgent. I'm coming. I'm coming. Jesus, keep your panty hose on. [Buzz] Brigman here. Yeah, Kirkhill, what's going on? At 0922 local time today, an American nuclear submarine, the USS Montana with 156 men aboard, went down about 22 miles from here. Damn. There's been no contact with the sub since then. The cause of the incident is not known. Your company's authorized the navy's use of this facility for a rescue operation code-named Operation Salvo. You want us to search for the sub? No. We know where it is, but she's in 2,000 feet of water, and we can't reach her. We need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors, if any. Don't you have your own stuff for this kind of thing? By the time we get our rescue submersibles here, the storm front will be right on us. You can get your rig in under the storm and be on site in 15 hours. That makes you our best option right now. Why should we risk our butts for something like this? I have been authorized to offer you all special bonuses equivalent to three times normal dive pay. Yes, sir, buddy! Hell, for triple time, I'd eat Beanie. They could set me on fire and put me out with horse piddle. I don't know what kind of deal you guys made with the company, but my people are not qualified for this. We're oil workers. This is a paycheck, man! Just shut up! Hold it down. This is Lieutenant Coffey. He will transfer down to you with a SEAL team and supervise the operation. You can send down whoever you like, Commodore, but I'm the tool-pusher on this rig, and when it comes to the safety of these people, there's me and then there's God, understand? If things get dicey, I'm pulling the plug. I think we're all on the same wavelength, Brigman. Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled, shall we? All right. Let's get ready to move. Let's take it about 5 degrees left, all right? Roger. 5 degrees left, Bud. Plot these numbers to our position. I need to know when they're... Well, it's official, sports fans. They're calling it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be making our lives real interesting in a few hours. Fred, huh? I don't know, man. I think hurricanes should be named after women, don't you? I can't believe you're letting them do this. Hi, Linds. I thought you were in Houston. I was. Now I'm here. Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud? It wasn't up to me. Jesus, we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work. I can't believe you let them grab my rig! Your rig? My rig. I designed the damn thing. Yeah, and Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long as they're holding the pink slip, I go where they tell me. I had a lot riding on this, and they bought you, didn't they? More like rented you cheap! I'm switching off now. Bye-bye. Oh, O.K., Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to a fight. Bye-bye. Virgil? God, I hate that bitch. Probably shouldn't have married her, then, huh? Roger, Cab 3. You're clear to launch. Hang on, gentlemen. She's clear! Touchdown. Crowd goes wild. Explorer, this is Cab 3. We are styling. How are you boys doing back there? Great. Explorer, this is Cab 3 starting our descent along the umbilical. Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck. Luck is not a factor. * And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari * * Tehachapi to Tonopah * Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made * * Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed * Deep Core, Deep Core, this is Cab 3 on final approach. Roger, Cab 3. Is that you, Lindsey? None other. Oh, no. Howdy, boys. Hey, Lindsey. I'll be damned! Y'all shouldn't be down here, sweet thing. Might run your stockings. The bad news is, we got eight hours in this can blowing down, and the worse news is, it's going to take us three weeks to decompress later. We've all been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman. Just don't call me that, O.K.? I hate that. All right. Well, what would you like us to call you? Sir? O.K., here we go. Y'all start equalizing... now. Let's watch each other closely for signs of H.P.N.S. High-pressure nervous syndrome-- Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first, nausea, increased excitability... disorientation... * And a partridge in a pear tree ** About 1 person in 20 can't handle it. They just go buggo. Look, they've all made runs to this depth. They're checked out. No, I understand that. What I'm saying is that it's impossible to predict just who's susceptible. They're checked out! These guys are SEALs? Yeah. These guys ain't so tough. I've fought guys plenty tougher than them. Now do we get to hear how you could have been a contender? Hey! Hey! You see this? Yeah. They used to call this the hammer. Y'all are done to a turn and ready to serve. Everybody O.K.? They're really very sweet. Hey! I don't remember putting a wall here. How you doing, Jammer? Pretty good. How are you, little lady? I'm O.K. I want a full check on their gear. Yes, sir. These guys are as much fun as a tax audit. You got that right. Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease. Hi, Linds. Well, well. Mrs. Brigman. Not for long. You never did like being called that, did you? Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night in flat-bed? Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi. Hey, One Night, it's Lindsey. Oh, hi, Lindsey. So, what are you doing down here, hot rod? You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do. Once you're disconnected from the Explorer, you guys are on your own for however long this storm lasts. What if something was to happen... What would you have done? Wow. You're right. Us poor, dumb old boys might have had to think for ourselves. It could have been a disaster. What to know what I think? Jesus, look where this thing is set. You want to know what I think? Not particularly. I think you were worried about me. Then that must be it. No, seriously. I think you were. Come on. It's O.K. It's O.K. You can admit it. I was worried about the rig. I've got over four years invested in this project. Yeah. You only had three years invested in me. Well, you have to have priorities. Oh, shit. I'm cutting you loose, Bud. O.K., One Night, stay clear. We're setting her down. Touchdown. This is us. We're sitting right on the edge of the Cayman trough. This is the Montana, 300 meters away, 70 meters below us. We think she slid down the wall and now sits here on this outcropping. So we're going to have to drop straight down here. This tell us how much radiation we're getting? Whoa! I'm not going near no radiation. No way! Aw, Hippy, you pussy. Yeah? What good is the money? Six months later, your dick drops off. What is your problem, huh? On this dive, you'll do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me, and you'll follow those orders without discussion. Is that clear? All right. I want everyone finished prep and ready to get wet in 15 minutes. All right. Let's throw it in the water. Keep it coming. Hippy, throw me one of them cyalumes, please. Yeah, sure. Good. Good. Excuse me. What is all this stuff? Fluid-breathing system. We just got them. You use it when you go really deep. How deep? Deep. How deep? It's classified. Anyway, you breathe liquid so you can't get compressed. The pressure doesn't get you. You mean you got liquid in your lungs? Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion. Bullshit. Check this out. Can I borrow your rat? What are you doing? You're going to kill her! It's O.K. I've done this myself. Oh, man! What? Are you just drowning her? She's going to be fine. I've breathed this myself. It's going to be fine. No, man. She's going to drown! Look. She's freaking out! Just going through a normal adjustment period. He's taking the fluid into his lungs. He's taking the fluid into his lungs. There he goes. There's a bit of anxiety here. Now he's starting to relax. He's breathing fine. See his chest moving? He's getting plenty of oxygen. Ha. Damn rat's breathing that shit. That is no bullshit, hands down, the goddamnedest thing I ever saw. See, the fluid's harder to push in and out than air. It's a little more work to breathe. He's doing fine. He's digging it. She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it. All right. Let her out now. Now! O.K. All right. O.K. Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs. All right. Give her here. Give her. Give her. Here's your rat. See? He's fine. It's a she. Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Flat-bed, you on line? 10-4, Lindsey. We read you loud and clear. Starting our descent. Divers, how you doing? Everybody's O.K. So far. Hang on, boys. It's all downhill from here. Hey, how deep's the drop-off here? This here's a bottomless pit, baby-- 2 1/2 miles straight down. Cab 3, it's Bud. You on-line? Cab 3, check. I'm right behind you. Cab 1, do you see it yet? Magnetometer's twitching, but I don't see anything yet. Hang on. I want to test my strobes. Cab 1, do you have a visual? Cab 1, do you copy? Yeah. Roger that. Found it. Cab 1, radiation readings. Neutron counter's not showing much. All right. Just continue forward and along the hull. Copy that. Continuing forward. You want me to get shots of everything, yes? Roger that. Document as much as you can, but please keep moving. Remember, we're on a tight time line. Copy that. Coming up to the midship's hatch. Do you see it, Cab 3? Yeah. Roger. I got it. How do you want me? Just hold above it. Roger. Holding. O.K., it's all yours, Lieutenant. All right, A-team. Let's do it. O.K., Perry, Hippy, let's get that R.O.V. launched. O.K., we're on it, boss. Go! Little Geek is on the case. Monk here, sir. We got the midship's outer hatch open. We're going in. Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right? That's right. Looks like a couple of the hatches have sprung. Radiation's nominal. Warheads must still be intact. How many are there? 24 trident missiles. 8 MIRVs per missile. That's 192 warheads, Coffey. How powerful are they? Your MIRV is a tactical nuke. 50 kilotons nominal yield, say, five times Hiroshima. Just set it down here. Copy that. There's a breach in the pressure hold. That's where we go in. We're solid. Let's go. All right. Let's go. O.K. Let's just take it slow and easy going in. Don't take any chances. Where are we, Coffey? This is the forward berthing compartment. This way. Come on. Let's keep up. All right. Up this way to the control center. It's jammed. Give me a hand. Get up here with that pry bar. It's moving! Pull! All right. We knew we were going to see this. Just move on. Come on, Jammer. Let's go. O.K. Let's stay cool. Everybody stay cool. We can't help these guys, but we might find somebody further in. [Breathes Sharply] Hey, Jammer. You O.K.? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. How you guys doing? I'm dealing. Triple time sounded like a lot of money, Bud. It ain't. We're here. Let's get it done, O.K.? Brigman, take your men and continue aft. Split up into two teams. Come on. Let's get moving. We head back in 14 minutes. Let's go. You still with me, Jammer? Where are we? Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes. Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Hey, Jammer. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You O.K.? Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy. Everybody's dead! They're all dead! O.K. I'm taking you back out. Let's go. No. I'm O.K. I'm O.K. I just can't go any further in. O.K., Jammer. No problem. You stay right here. I've got to check out this compartment, all right? We'll stay in voice contact. You hold on the end of this rope here. You have any problem whatsoever, you tug twice. I got it. Just relax, all right? You'll be O.K. O.K. Be right back. [Heavy Breathing] You still reading me O.K., big guy? Read you fine, Bud. O.K. Just a few more minutes. There's a couple compartments up ahead that might have air. O.K. No problem. We got to be sure, right? Hang on, Jammer. You just hold on to that-- Shit! Bud? Bud, can you hear me? Bud? Bud? Goddamn it! [Hyperventilating] Oh, Jesus! [Hyperventilating] [Breathing Slows] Bud, is that you? Hang on, Jammer. Lew, Cat, hurry up! On the double! I'm on my way. [Gurgling] Jammer! What's the problem? He's convulsing! It's his mixture. Too much oxygen. Got to get the O2 cut down! Turn him over! Crank it down, man! You're losing him! All right. We got to get him out of here. Let's go. Let's move it. Easy, big fella. That's it. One Night, do you see the divers? Are they out yet? Negative, Lindsey. Haven't seen hide nor hair. Let's give them two minutes more max, and then I'll sound a diver recall. Lindsey, do you copy? Meet me at flat-bed. This is a diver emergency. Linds, do you copy? Uh, yeah, copy you, Bud. I'm on my way. Look, I'm just a medic, which is mostly about patching holes. This type of thing, it's-- There's not much I can do. A coma could last hours or days. So you didn't get anything on the cameras. No. I didn't get a picture of it. What about the video? No. We lost power right then. Look, I just don't want to talk about this, O.K.? Fine. Be that way. Look, I don't know what I saw, Bud, O.K.? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine, it's a Russian submersible. No problem. Yeah, but you think it was something else. What? One of ours? No. Well, whose then? Come on, Lindsey, talk to me. Look, Jammer saw something down there, something that scared the hell out of him. His mixture got screwed up. Jammer panicked. He pranged his regulator, and his mixture got screwed up. But what did he see that made him panic? Well, what do you think he saw? I don't know. Did any of you see it? No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it. It could have been a Russian bogey. Oh, Cinclant fleet's going to go ape shit. Two Russian attack subs, Etango and Evicto, were tracked within 50 miles of here. Now they don't know where the hell they are. O.K. I haven't got any choice. I'm confirming you to go to phase two. You'll recover one warhead, arm it, and wait for further instructions. We got a problem with that? Negative, sir. [Whistles] Better come on. Shh! Turn it up, folks. Sources have not confirmed any reports that the Montana encountered a Soviet fast-attack sub prior to its sinking. and the Kremlin continues to deny any involvement. Oh, that's us. That's us, man. Shut up! ...participating in the recovery operation. There is a tremendous amount of activity. With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup of American forces has drawn official protest from Havana and Moscow. Russian and Cuban trawlers, undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been circling the area, and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away. This sucks. Hippy, what's the matter with you? What's the matter with me? Nothing. We're just in the middle of some big-time international incident like the Cuban missile crisis or something. Figured that out for yourself, did you, Hip? We got Russian subs creeping around. Anything goes wrong, they could say whatever they want happened, give the folks medals. Relax, will you? You're making the women nervous. Cute, Virgil. You know, those SEALs ain't telling us diddly. Something is going on! Come on, come on. Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy. Everything is. Coffey's splitting with flat-bed. I showed him how to work the controls, and they're out of here. Didn't you tell him we need it right now? Yeah. He didn't pay any attention. Where the hell is he taking it? I have no idea! Shit! Coffey! Come back! We need the big arm to unhook the umbilical. There's a goddamn hurricane coming! He switched off. It's unbelievable. Go back down. Tell those men to get below and stay there. We need to get unhooked and get out of here now. All right, do it then. No problem, except your boys went sightseeing with flat-bed. My people need flat-bed to get unhooked at their end. Back in two hours. Two hours? We're going to get the shit kicked out of us by our pal Fred in two hours. O.K. It's clear. It's all yours, sir. Swing it away and drop it. Check. O.K. Bypass the ground connection on the separation sequencer. Got it? Separation sequencer disconnected. Remove explosive bolts one through six in counterclockwise sequence. Check. Removing bolt one. All right. Let's get their gear off! Then clear the sub. We got to get it out of here! Come on. Let's go! Let's move it! One Night, you're up. Get ready to roll, baby. Don't touch that. Just back away. Excusez-moi! Hey, Coffey, we are a little pressed for time. Prick. This ain't no drill, slick. Make me proud. Piece of cake, baby. What's the problem, One Night? All hell must be breaking loose up there. This cable's pissing me off. I can't get a grip on it. Well, keep trying, baby, just keep trying. Son of a bitch! Shit! We got a problem! What's going on? We're losing number two thruster! Bearing's going! She's not going to take the pressure! It's not holding! We're swinging out of position here! Goddamn it! Ooh! Jesus. Ah, shit! The rig is moving! Yeah, I can see that. Topside! Topside! Pay out some slack. We're getting dragged. Down on number one winch! Down on one! Bud, we're headed right for the drop-off. What the hell? We just lost all the topside feeds. Shit! Get him on the UQC! Bud! We lost the crane! Say again. What? The crane! We've lost the crane! It's on its way down to you! All right, everybody! Everybody ready for impact! Close all the exterior hatches! Let's move it! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! [Alarm] Wait! Wait! Wait! Get in here! What the hell is going on around here? I don't know. You two help secure the rig. Let's go. One Night, you hear me? Get the hell out of there! The crane's coming down! I'm O.K. I'm clear, Bud. [Radar Beeps] I've got it. It's headed straight for us! Oh, shit. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God! Bud! Grab on to something! Jesus! Battery rooms front. Let's go! Cat, put that out! Bud, drillroom's flooding! Get back down there! Uhh! Go! I'll take the battery room. Jesus! [Alarm] Uhh! Shit. Get out of there! Close the door! Seal the room! Lindsey, let's get out of here! Whoa! [Squeak Squeak] Let's get the hell out of here! Aah! Let's go! Let's go! Get the door! Get the door! Ah, Jesus! Bud! Bud! Philip, cut the hose! Cut the line to the motor! I can't open it from out here! Philip, cut the hose! [Creak] Philip! God. [Coughing] Uhhh! Hey! Heyyyy! Hey! Heyyyy! Come on, Sonny! Hey, Cat! Cat! Help me out, man! Hang on! Uhh! Uhh! The hose! Cut the hose, the line to the motor. Hurry up, man! Come on, Cat! Hurry! Come on, Sonny, help me out. Come on, push! Come on, Sonny! O.K., let's go! Come on, let's go! We got to go, go, go! Get out of here! Come on! Move it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Get the hatch, Cat! Get the hatch! Will you get the hatch? You all right? Everybody O.K.? Yeah. Yeah. Son of a bitch. Oh, man. Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer, this is Deep Core-2. Do you read me? Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer, this is Deep Core. Do you read me? Over. Forget it, Sonny. They're gone, man. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Hey. They're gone. Hey, Jammer. Shh! I got it. I'll do it. Do it yourself. Find your buddy? Ah. No. Tighter. Brigman! What? I was under orders. I had no choice. How's it going, Cat? What's the scoop, ace? Well, I can get power to this module and sub bay if I reroute these buses, but I got to get past the mains, which are a total meltdown. Bud, there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a few hours, this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker. What about O2? Yeah, well, brace yourself. If we close off the sections we're not using, we have about maybe 12 hours' worth. The storm's going to last a lot longer than 12 hours. Yeah, well, I can maybe extend that, maybe. There's some storage tanks outboard next to the wrecked module. I'll have to go outside, though, and tie on to them. Hey, Linds. Linds. Yeah. I'm glad you're here. Yeah? I'm not. Where are you now, Linds? I'm under the starboard tri-module. Still with me, Hip? Right behind you, Linds. How's it look? Well, you guys really screwed up my rig. There's a lot of wreckage out here. Well, don't get fouled. Hit me with that 9/16, O.K.? Yeah. Thank you. Come on. Let's see those muscles. Bingo. That's one. Two for two. Hey, hey. Lindsey, do you read me? Over. Copy you, Hippy. What's the matter? Shit. The power's jacking around with us again. Lindsey, come back. I just lost video. [Audio Fades] Hippy, do you copy? Linds, you copy? Oh, shit. What the hell? Hippy, do you copy? Damn it. Bud, do you copy? Over. I seem to be having a problem here. Shit. Damn it. [Shutter Clicking] That's a great shot, Lindsey. Did you drop your dive line? Come on, you guys. Now that's the small one. You can kind of see how it's zigging around. Yeah, whatever it is. I'm telling you what it is. You're just not hearing me. Now, Lindsey-- There is something down there. Something not us. You could be more specific. Something that zigs. Not us. Not human. Get it? Something nonhuman, but intelligent. A nonterrestrial intelligence. A nonterrestrial intelligence. N.T.I.s! Oh, man, that's better than UFOs! Oh, but that works, too, huh? Underwater flying objects. Are we talking little space friends here? Hell, yeah! Hot rods of the gods. Right, Linds? No, really. It could be N.T.I.s. The C.I.A. has known about them forever. They abduct people all the time, man. Hippy, do me a favor. Stay off my side. Will you step into my office, please? Certainly. I-- Come here. Jesus, Linds. Bud, something really important is happening here. I'm trying to keep this situation under control. I can't allow you to create this kind of hysteria. Who's hysterical? Nobody's hysterical! Shhh! All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving your arms around. Look, I saw something. I'm not going to go in there and say I didn't when I did. I'm sorry. Please. You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. Yes, I am, but I need you to believe me right now. Now, come on. Look at me. Come on. Am I stressed out? Do I have any symptoms of pressure sickness, tremor, slurred speech? No. No. Bud, this is me, Lindsey, O.K.? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips. I saw these things. I touched one of them, and it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build. It glided. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Oh, God, I wish you'd been there. It was a machine. It was a machine, but it was alive. It was like a dance of light. Please, you have to trust me. Now, I don't think they mean us any harm. I don't know how I know that. It's just a feeling. Geez. I'm supposed to go on a feeling? How can I go on a feeling? Coffey's going to go on a feeling? We all see what we want to see. Coffey looks and he sees Russians. He sees hate and fear. You have to look with better eyes than that. Please. I can't, Linds. I'm sorry. Got it. All right. Come on. I just square it away a little to the left. What is that? Oh, this is not happening. Oh, man. I'm shaking, man. All right. Wait, wait, wait. And now... here's MIRV! Come on, man. What else could it be? Why bring it here? It's got to be some kind of emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians, right? They hot-wire one of the nukes. They use some kind of detonator that they brought, then they stick it back in the sub. Fry the whole thing up. Bam! Slicker than snot. I'm telling you, and I'm not being paranoi-- Hi, Linds. Linds! Will you just wait a second? Goddamn it! If you don't do something about it, I will! Lindsey, we'll do something about it! Wait a second. Lindsey. What? Just stop and think about this for a second. What? You know, you got some huevos, bringing that thing into my rig. With all that's going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here! Mrs. Brigman-- Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me? Mrs. Brigman, you don't need to know the details of our operation. It's better if you don't. You're right! I don't need to know! What I need to know is that thing is off this rig. Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet? You're becoming a serious impediment to our mission. Now you either do an about-face and walk out of here, or I'll have you escorted out. I will not do an about-face and get out of here! Who the hell do you think you're talking to? [Alarm Rings] Emergency! Maintenance room B! Emergency! Everybody move it! On the double! Now! In here! Come on! We've got trouble! What's going on? All right! All right! What's up? What's happening? All right. You let her go, man. Do it. Do it now! Let her go. The smartest thing you ever did. Coffey, you son-- Lindsey! Cool it. What's the problem? Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren't we? We don't need them. We can't trust them. We may have to take steps. We're going to have to take steps. Linds, I want you to stay away from that guy. I mean it. The guy is gone. Did you see his hands? What? He's got the shakes? Look, he's operating on his own. He's cut off from his chain of command. He's showing signs of pressure-induced psychosis, and he's got a nuclear weapon. So as a personal favor to me, will you try to put your tongue in neutral for a while? I got to tell you, I give this whole thing a sphincter factor of about 9.5. Look, you can just punch into his primary guidance chip where you want him to go and he'll go there, right? No. Bad idea, Lindsey. Bad. Why, Hip? Come on. Because even if it could take the pressure at that depth, which I don't think it can, without the tether, you know what would happen when it got down there? It would just sit like a dumb shit. Something would have to pass in front of the camera for you to see anything. I know, but we could get lucky, right? So we should go for it. I really ought to talk to Bud about this. No. This is between you and me. We get proof, and then we tell the others. Hippy, look. If we can prove to Coffey that there aren't Russians down there, maybe he'll ease off the button a little bit. I got to tell you, man, that guy scares me more than anything we're going to find down there. He's a goddamn, A.J. Squared-away, jar-head robot. All right. Give me a couple hours. I'll see what I can do. Great. Thanks. [Snoring] Virgil, turn on your side. All right. You're all set, big guy. Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face. Good night, little buddy. Bud. Bud! Bud, get up! What? Cat. Cat! Hey! God-- leave me alone. Bud. Oh, wait. It's O.K. Sweet Christ almighty. I think it likes you. It's trying to communicate. It's Bud. That's wonderful. It's me. No, no, no. Shhh! It's O.K. What is it? Is it alive? Lindsey, no. Seawater. Man. Come on. Come on! Hurry. Where the hell's it going? Huh? Hurry. I think it's headed for "B" module. Linds, you see it? [Beeping] [Lindsey] So raise your hand if you think that was a Russian water tentacle. Lieutenant? No? Well... a breakthrough. Hey, ace, you done impressing yourself? No way that thing could just be seawater. They must have learned to control water. I mean, at a molecular level. You know, they can plasticize it. They can polymerize it, do whatever they want to do with it. They can put it under intelligent control. Maybe their whole technology's based on that. What? Controlling water. Was it the same thing that you saw the last time? No. You know, I don't think that that thing you saw was one of them. What are you talking about? I mean, I don't think it was an N.T.I. I think it was like their version of an R.O.V., like Big Geek. Hippy, you mean they was just checking us out? Yeah. How come? Curious, I suppose. We're probably the first people they've ever seen. It went straight for the warhead, and they think it's cute. You need to get some sleep. We have no way of warning the surface. And you know what that means. It means whatever happens is up to us. Us! Sniff something? Did you, rat boy? Hey! Freeze! Don't move! That's right. You O.K., Hip? They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the N.T.I.s. What? We set it up to go right to them. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Take this. We're going to phase three. What? We don't have orders for that. I programmed Big Geek to go down to the bottom of the trench and shoot some video. Now they got the warhead tied to it. Coffey. Linds. Coffey-- No. Come on. Coffey, just think about what you're doing, O.K.? Just one minute. just think about what you're doing-- Get back! This is something I've wanted to do since we first met. [Tearing Sound] Easy. Easy. Easy. All right. Into the kitchen, let's go! Move, partner! Get your damn hands off of me! I know the way. Your boss is fixing to pull the pin on 50 kilotons! And we're all going to be ringside! He's having a full-on meltdown! What's the timer set for? Three hours. Shut up. Don't talk. Three hours. We can't get to minimum safe distance in three hours. We can't go to phase three. What about these people? Shut up. What's the matter with you? Everybody just stay calm. The situation is under control. Anybody touches that door, kill them. Schoenick, your lieutenant's about to make a real bad career move. The guy's crazier than a shit-house rat! We're trying to make contact! Can't you see he's lost it? Shut up! The shock wave will kill us. Quiet! It will crush this rig like a beer can. Shut up, man! What are you talking about? We've got to stop him. Shut up! This is not our mission. We can't detonate without orders. [Lindsey] Schoenick, please! Schoenick, listen. He's about to declare war on an alien species just when they're trying to make contact with us! Please! I don't know. I think I'm reaching him. [Scoffs] Yeah. Ho ho ho ho. I'll be damned. Jammer! Is everybody O.K.? Oh, man! Don't move, jar face! Look, I'm the least of your problems. Take it easy, Hip. I'm all right. How you feeling, big guy? I'm O.K., Bud. I just figured I was dead back there when I saw that angel coming for me. Uh...yeah, O.K. Yeah. Why don't you tell us about it later? Come on. He's got it tied off with something. Come on. Ready? We're not going to be able to budge it. Now what? This is the only door to sub bay. What are you doing? I'm going to swim to hatch six. What? I'm going to get inside, and then I'm going to open the door from the other side. Bud, this water is freezing. Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh? Wish us luck. You coming along? Looks that way. All right, Cat. Come on, Bud. In case I don't die. This is insane. Come on, Bud. Let's go, partner. I ain't got all day. I got it. Argh! [Gasping] We're going to have to go to the moon pool. It's the only way. I can't. I can't make it, partner. I'm sorry. O.K. O.K., Cat. You head on back, all right? What is he doing? He can't make it to the door. He's going to try and take him out himself. God, he couldn't be that dumb. That guy's a trained killer. No! Coffey. Coffey, listen. [Click] Hey! Argh! Aah! Aah! Hey! Bud, you all right? Get him, Cat! He's locked it, Bud. We got to get this off of here. Come on, help me. Pull the gripper! Pull it! Cat, get the door. Shit. Come on. Shoot! Shoot! Are you all right? Yeah. The safety's on. Safety's on! Give me that. Come on, let's go! Help me out! Give me a hand. Let's move it! One Night, what about Cab 1? Ready to launch. Go! You're better in these than I am. You got air? Come on. Come on. You got air. You got air. You got air. Shit! [Music Plays] [Music Stops] Bud, get out of the way! Jesus. Get in! Hurry up! I'm coming, baby. Keep your panty hose on. Are you O.K.? Yeah. Do you see Big Geek? Yeah. Right out in front. Oh, my God! Get after him. O.K. O.K. Get on the arm. You missed. Try it again. Steady. Steady. Steady. Steady. Steady. O.K. Grab it! Got it! Pretty slick, slick. Hold it really steady. Hold it still. I am. I am. Aah! Shit! We lost Geek! Where is he, Bud? Do you see him? I'll take a look. He's coming up fast. Step on it. Shit! Go to the right. Swing to the right. Shit. Keep moving, baby. Come here. Son of a bitch! Hard left, baby. Left, left, left! Jesus Christ, lady. Bud, if you think you can do any better, then you're welcome up here. Son of a bitch! Is he right on us? Yeah, he's right on your ass. O.K. O.K. Where are you going? Hang on. Aah! Deep Core, this is Cab 1. Do you read? Deep Core, Deep Core, this is Cab 1. Over. I'm not getting any answer, and we're flooding like a son of a bitch. Yeah. You noticed? You know, you did O.K. back there, Virgil. I was fairly impressed. Yeah? Well, not good enough. We still got to catch Big Geek. Yeah? Well, not in this thing. Deep Core, Deep Core, this is Cab 1. Over. Try it again. Deep Core, this is Cab 1. We need a-- Aah! You all right? Yeah. Well, that's that. Yeah. Wonderful. There's a light coming from somewhere. It's off to the right. Yeah. That's the rig. It's a good 60, 70 yards, I'd say. Well, they'll come after us. Yeah, but it's going to take them a while to get here. We got to get this flooding stopped. Can you see where it's coming in? Yeah. Can you hold the lamp for me? There's a busted fitting behind this panel. Problem is, I don't think I can get to it. You got any tools? I don't know. I'll have to look around. Yeah? Well, I looked already. Goddamn it! All I need's a damn crescent wrench. Come on. Son of a bitch! O.K. Calm down, Bud. Calm down. O.K. O.K. O.K. We got to get you out of here. How? I don't know how. All right. We've only got one suit. I know, but we've got to come up with something. Oh, my God! I'm freezing! Come here. Give me your hands. Listen. You're smart. Think of something. Can't you think of something? Think of something. O.K. Why don't you swim back to the rig and bring back another suit? That would take me about 7, 8 minutes to swim, get the gear, come back. I wouldn't make it. Look at this. By the time I got back, you'd be-- O.K. O.K. Let's look around. Just look. Oh, my God. Is that working? Shit. All right. All right. Bud, I'm getting cold. Here. You put this on. No! No! What are you doing? Don't argue with me, goddamn it! Just put it on. No. Look, this is not an option, so just forget about it, all right? Lindsey, shut up and put this thing on. Look, will you be logical? Fuck logic! For one second, please listen. Just listen for one second. Now, you've got the suit on, and you're a much better swimmer than I am, right? Yeah, maybe. Right? Yes! So I've got a plan. What's the plan? I drown, and you tow me back to the rig. No! No! Yes. This water is only a couple of degrees above freezing. I go into deep hypothermia. My blood will go like ice water, right? My body systems will slow down. They won't stop. Linds. You tow me back, and I can... I can be revived after maybe 10 or 15 minutes. Lindsey, put this on. No. It's the only way. You just put this on. Put this on. You know I'm right. Please. It's the only way. You've got all the stuff on the rig to do this. Put this on, Bud, please. This is insane. No. Oh, my God. You O.K.? It's the only way. Here. Hold this. Son of a bitch. Hold on, Lindsey. You can do this, you know. You can do this. Oh, God, Lindsey. I know. You can tell me later. Oh, God. [Sobbing] This is maybe not such a good idea. Oh, my God! Bud! I can't, Bud! Oh, Bud, I'm scared! No! I got him. I got him. Where? Oh, my God. It's Lindsey. Deep Core. Deep Core, do you read? Over. Yeah. We got you, Bud. We're here. Go to the infirmary. Get the cart oxygen, defib kit, You got all that? Got it. Over. Now! Come on! Let's go. Hippy, get the hot packs. Got it. Here he comes! Get her up. Watch her head. Watch her head. I got it. Watch her feet. Watch her head coming down. Watch her head. First we got to clear it out. Is she cleared? Is she cleared? Get the defib ready. Hurry up, Cat. O.K. O.K. I got it. O.K.? Yeah. 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand, 5. Breathe. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand-- No, no, it won't work. She's got to have bare skin, or it won't work. 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand, breathe. Here. Is that right? Is this it? I've got it. Well, do it! All right. Come on, zap her! Clear! Come on, baby. Christ! Nothing. Breathe. I'll check out 300. Nothing. It's going. It's going. It's charging. 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand. Charging, charging, charging... clear! Is there anything? No pulse. Come on, baby. It's charging. One more time. Zap her again. Come on! Come on! Clear! God! No pulse! It's flat. Goddamn, it's flat. 3, 4, 5. One thousand. 1, 2, 3, 4. Breathe. 1, 2, 3, 4, breathe. 3 one thousand. Come on, baby. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand. Come on, baby. Come on. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand, 5 one thousand. Come on, baby. Breathe. Bud. Come on. 2 one thousand. Bud. 3 one thousand, 4 one thousand. Bud. Bud. Bud. It's all over, man. It's all over. I'm sorry. No pulse. No! No. She has a strong heart! She wants to live! Come on, Linds. Come on, baby! Zap her again. Do it! Charging. Do it! Charging. [Beeping] [Steady Hum] Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Clear. Clear! Get out of here. Come on, breathe, baby. Goddamn it, breathe! Goddamn you, bitch, you never backed away from anything in your life! Now fight! Fight! Fight! Right now! Do it! Fight, goddamn it! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Lindsey. That's it, Lindsey. That's it, Linds. You can do it. That's it, Linds. Come on back, baby. Come on. You can do it, baby. [Coughing] Get her some air. Easy. Breathe easy. All right. All right. You did it, ace! Yeah! Yeah! You did it, baby. She's breathing. She's breathing. Make sure her heart's O.K. Make sure her heart's doing O.K. Big boys don't cry, remember? Hi, lady. Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, didn't it? Yeah, of course it did. You're never wrong, are you? How you feeling, huh? I've felt better. What did you do to me? Next time, it's your turn, O.K.? Yeah. Yeah, you got that right. O.K. These are so your eyes can focus in the breathing fluid. How's that feel? There it is. If you can't see, you can't disarm the bomb, right? O.K., with this much weight, you're going to fall like a brick. We've still got about an hour, so you should get there in plenty of time. When you get down there, all you got to do is cut one wire, drop the weights, and come on home. Hand me that wrench over there, will you? Maybe I ought to check and see. Yeah, that's a good place. There. That's loose. I'll fix that up. Bud, you don't have to do this. Somebody's got to do it. It doesn't have to be you. Who, then? So I can hear you, but I can't talk, right? The fluid prevents the larynx from making sound. Excuse me. You'll feel a little strange. Yeah? No shit. I got to warn you all, I'm a pretty lousy typist. Moment of truth. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Careful. Easy. In the front, clamp it. O.K. Thank you. Got it. Set. Set. Clamp? Set. O.K. Let's rock 'n' roll. Crack it. Headset. Headset, please. O.K. Relax now, Bud. Just relax. Bud. Relax now, Bud. Watch me. O.K. Relax. O.K. Doing fine. Now, don't hold your breath. Take it in. Just let yourself take it in. Take it in. That's it. Oh, man. Don't hold your breath now. Take it in. There you go. Don't hold your breath. Take it in. That's it. There you go. Bud! This is not normal! This is normal! It'll pass in a second. It's perfectly normal. This is normal? Perfectly normal. We all breathed liquid for nine months, Bud. Your body will remember. That's it. That's it. Perfectly normal. Christ, he's breathing. Give me that. Can you hear me? There he goes. Yes? Yes, O.K. That's it. Bud, try your keypad. Right. I already have. Great. Let's go. O.K. That's O.K. I got it. I got it. O.K., Hippy. You done yet? Hold on, Jammer. Okay, Bud. Easy. Easy. Watch out. Watch the side. Watch the back. Careful. I rigged in Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek! It should take you straight there! All you have to do is hang on! What's his depth? 3,200 feet. Your depth is 3,200 feet. You're doing fine. You better watch out for crane wreckage. You should be almost to it. 4,800 feet. It's official. Yeah. Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning, huh? One mile down. Still grinning. 8,500 feet. 8,500 feet, Bud. Everything O.K.? Ask him about pressure effects-- tremors, vision problems, euphoria. Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel. It's starting. It hits the nervous system first. Keep talking, Lindsey. Let him hear your voice. O.K., Bud. Your depth is 8,900 feet. You're doing fine. No, Lindsey. Talk to him. Bud... there are some... some things I need to say. It's hard for me, you know. It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch. It takes discipline and years of training. A lot of people don't appreciate that. Jesus, I'm sorry I can't tell you these things to your face. I have to wait till you're alone in the dark, freezing, and there's 10,000 feet of water between us. Coming up on the big ten thou. [Crack] 12,000 feet. Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this. Please. Shut up. What's wrong with you? Bud, how are you doing? Bud? He's losing it. Talk to him. Keep him with us. Coming up on 16,000. No, Bud, Bud, it's the pressure, all right? You have to listen to my voice. You have to try. Concentrate, all right? Just listen to my voice, please. 17,000 feet. Christ almighty, this is insane. Bud? I'm not getting anything. [Crack] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, come on! No, no! What? Little Geek just folded. Jesus! He can still make it. Bud, I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness. But I'm there in the dark with you. Oh, Bud, you're not alone! I'm with you. I'll always be with you, Bud. I promise that. How you doing, partner? You still with us? Come back. You talk to us, buddy boy. Come on. Bud. Talk to me, Bud. Now, come on. You hanging in there? Just-- You have to talk to me, Bud. Please. I need to know if you're O.K. [Sighs] You see-- you see a light. What kind of light, Bud? He's hallucinating badly. He made it. Oh, my God. Oh, man. O.K., Bud. We'll go step by step. Remove the detonator housing by unscrewing it counterclockwise. All right, Bud. You have to cut the ground wire, not the lead wire. It's the blue wire with the white stripe. Not--I repeat-- Not the black wire with the yellow stripe. Ah ha ha ha! Yes! Quiet! Quiet! Save your air! Bud, give me a reading off your liquid oxygen gauge. What? It took him 30 minutes just to get down there! Bud, do you hear me? You drop your weights and start back now, Bud! That gauge could be wrong! Do you hear me? Just drop your weights and start back now. Your gauge could be wrong! Your gauge could be wrong! You drop your weights and start back now! No, you won't stay there! Do you hear me? You drop your weights. You can breathe shallow. Do you hear me? Bud, please! Listen to me, please! Goddamn it, you dragged me back from the bottomless pit. You can't leave me here alone now, please. Oh, God, Virgil, please. Please. I love you. [Coughing] Howdy. Uh... how you guys doing? Deep Core, do you read? This is Benthic Explorer. Over. Do you hear, Deep Core? Deep Core, do you read? Do you read me, Deep Core? Deep Core, do you read? This is Benthic Explorer. Over. Hell, yes! We read. Good of you to join us. Copy, Deep Core. Hey, I've got them! How's that storm going up there? Well, it's strange. It just sort of blew itself out all of a sudden. Well, hell, son, you'd better get a line down to us. We're in moderately poor shape down here. We lost seven people, including Bud, and we're about out of O2, so whatever you're going to do, better do it fast. You boys make up your mind how to get us out of here yet? They're talking about flying in a D.S.R.V. from Norfolk. Right? It'll come in to Guantánamo on a C-133. O.K. How long is that going to take? Hey. Hey. Hey! It's Bud! That's impossible. No, it's not. Do you hear, Deep Core? Yes! Wa-Wait. We got a message from Bud. Bud? What's it say? Uh, here. Oh. It says, "Virgil Brigman back on the air." Yes! "Have some new friends down here." [Rumbling] What the hell's going on? One Night, get to sonar. Good God almighty. Fellas, I'm getting some awful big readings here. Something's coming up the wall. What is it? Whatever it is, it's major! Something's definitely going on down there. Active is pinging back something really big. It's huge, and it's coming up right underneath us. Where? Where? It's everywhere. There! Starboard bow. This is the Benthic Explorer. There! Look! Look! Help, Cat. We should be dead. We didn't decompress. They must have done something to us. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think you could say that. Ha ha ha! Ha! Hooo! Hi, Brigman. Hi, Mrs. Brigman.
