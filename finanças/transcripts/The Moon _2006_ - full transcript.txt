5 years ago... The manned Narai lunar probe flew into space, bringing with him a great Korean dream. However, because of a sudden explosion.... Colonel Park Tae-wook Captain Kang Min-woo Major Park Chan-ho We've lost three of our best astronauts. It was all so sudden. Not only for us, I think the people feel the most shock and grief. Due to disagreements with related countries, Korea was forced to withdraw from the Aerospace Federation. And the original lunar exploration program Aviation Federation seems to have ended in failure. So we have come to this decision. If compared to the Earth, the moon is like the South Pole. The moon contains an inexhaustible underground resource. It has a large amount of helium-3 with a power source can survive up to 10,000 human years. That's why the whole world is trying to reach the moon. Who will be the first to plant a flag on the moon? South Korea also made a commitment to the moon landing war. If we stop before this failure, then everything will end in failure. But if we can continue to challenge, then that failure will be elevated into the path of success for all of us. The result was Korea's second Woori manned lunar probe, will fly with three astronauts into space. Since I was little, my dream has been to become an astronaut. So the opportunity to carry out the mission Setting foot on the moon is an honor for me. Name? I want to think about it when we get to the moon, when I look at the Earth. This is a very arduous process. But with the unwavering support of my family more than anyone else, I was able to get through anything. This one? This was given to me by my son. The boy said... he would protect me. Although he practiced a lot during his UDT days, but I'm still a new pilot with little industry experience. So I will work with experienced seniors and we will not disappoint or sacrifice our predecessors. Total training time is 1 year and 8 months. After 2800 hours of arduous training, crew Lee Sang-won, Cho Yun-jong and Hwang Seon-woo, have completed preparations for work set foot on the moon, after the United States. After an extremely loud sound, Our Woori has taken off. The second manned spacecraft, Woori. Made with the most advanced technology in Korea. Pray for a safe landing on the moon. In December 2029, we have once again set off to the moon. We are on our way. THE MOON: THE FINAL MISSION From with love! Today, the highest level 5 alert level was announced due to solar wind caused by massive coronal mass ejection. All US satellites have been affected by the solar wind and satellite communications were down all day. Due to the radio communication barrier that occurred today, there were failures in the aviation and railway electronic control systems, many flights were delayed. According to video from our Nestle satellite, The United States' manned lunar orbiter, a space station orbiting the moon, also encountered problems. Today's solar storm is said to be extremely destructive. Space Station Orbiting the Moon The Lunar Space Station was also closed due to a Solar Storm. Let's learn more together. We have communication port but electronic controller and the navigation system has been discontinued and is being repaired. The atmosphere absorbs most of the Solar Storm. It is known that Woori lost contact with the space center, while approaching lunar orbit. Woori started taking off 3 days ago. But this morning, when preparing to enter lunar orbit, due to the influence of solar storms, The ship is currently losing contact with the Nalo Space Center. In a universe directly affected by solar storms, concerns about Woori are growing. Currently, the Space Center is confirming the exact cause of the communication loss. If communication is restored, then no later than midnight, we think we will be in lunar orbit and attempt to land. Minister, we still haven't found the cause of the problem. Is there really no problem getting into lunar orbit? Is the Woori ship itself safe? Minister! We have questions! Minister! 15 minutes left to start contacting. Woori lunar probe, affected by solar storm damaged mechanical equipment and disrupted communications. We are leaving the recording. Lieutenant Colonel Lee Sang-won and Captain Cho Yun-jong Reconfirming antenna and communication power. to restore power and antenna communication. Lieutenant Colonel, the pressure is increasing. Looks like an electrical problem. I think you should go back first. Do you hear that? H1-2032 is closed again. 2033 is the same. Current status... Thermal cell high temperature and H overload warnings are being reached. Why is the auxiliary line control system turned off here? It doesn't seem like it was played by anyone. The system's abnormal condition is continuing to increase. In summary, stages 11 to 14 of the guidance are underway. Recently, a thermal battery H1 also disconnected. Intermittent error on H2 is being fixed. Without the PT signal light, we cannot restart the power supply to the temperature control device, problems will continue to arise. And the bigger problem is mechanical setup program warning message has not yet... Support! Support! What's the matter? At this juncture. It's my personality that I can make jokes about. It was a very peaceful situation. It's not that serious, astronaut Hwang Seon-woo. Just follow the instructions. Honestly! Is UDT only picking on people who are easy to fool lately? You're giving me cancer. It's really noisy! We're going to explore the moon. But he was turning the atmosphere into a failure. I'm giving you orders. Turn off the signal and go to sleep. Hey, old geek! You think the universe is a joke? Besides, you're the head of that center, Your voice is very scary. Don't go out! Totally banned outside activities! But if we don't go out, Who's going to fix it? UDT, power up the command ship. Yes, I understand. Reset the power to the ship. Colonel, appears to have passed to the imaging team without incident. Captain Cho, after sending the pictures, we will return to the ship. Yes. But Colonel, unable to contact Earth, So this universe feels like hell. Hell what the fuck? Earth with your debt is hell. This is paradise. A perfect paradise with no late interest. How can you consider this hell when the universe is so sacred? How long have you been in this industry? Are you thinking about your wife? Yes, I will change my opinion. What's wrong? Are you crying? Who's crying? I just think about my son who is still in hell. Who's crying? Colonel, you still haven't named your unborn daughter? I just thought of that name. But this musty monkey solar storm! Hwang Seon-woo, check the train status. Don't panic. Minister, the possibility of two consecutive accidents is very low, Even this project is the same. The culprit in the first discovery was the previous minister, who did not consider the matter thoroughly. Who are you worried about? If there's a problem, I'll go back to parliament, you have nowhere else to go. I have already begged my superiors to take me to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Why do they want an arts student to become Minister of Science? Star? What's up? Contact was just restored a few minutes ago. Listen clearly, Woori. Woori. What's wrong? We just received the video signal. Astronaut Hwang Seon-woo. Please answer, Woori. Astronaut Hwang! What's wrong? How does it connect? Looks like the system is being fixed. We get the visual signal first. FD, what about the current location? The spacecraft is still flying to the lunar orbit as planned. Head of the center, but is it okay to stand outside the train like that? I will talk to each group. After restoring the network, the data will be backed up. Confirm status from remote control, electrical and pressurized systems. Be quick! How many times have I told you not to go out? Hwang Seon-woo. You say go. Besides error 1102, are there any other errors? Look for any other error codes. You try to confirm the solar cell. Error code 1240 is displayed. 1240 means... the lunar probe converter is disconnected. Colonel, must open this. I'll check to see if there's any problem with the spark inside. Okay, if you open it and find a problem, just throw one away. Three sheets is enough. But Yun-jong ah, Is there still plenty of oxygen? Yes, enough. Okay, if there's no problem, connect it first. Make sure there is no leak from the fuel tank. If there's nothing else, let's go inside. Clear. Colonel, what else do you want me to do? Contact is fine now. You... can change the song to another song. Stop creating a scary atmosphere. Center leader, it seems solar panel number 1 is short-circuiting. Captain Cho Yun-jong has moved to an unusual position. Maybe he's checking to see if there's something wrong with the fuel tank. You OK? I will confirm the fuel tank. Any... Lieutenant Colonel! I think you should come see what's going on. What's wrong? Fuel... fuel is leaking. Captain Cho! Captain Cho! Colonel! Why is the screen off? What's up? Can someone explain it to me? Colonel! Wake up! Colonel! No signal received from Captain Cho. What about Colonel Lee Sang-won? Colonel! Wake up! Please wake up! Colonel! Here ya! Here! Here! You are okay? Colonel? Colonel! Wake up! What should I do? Colonel? What's up? The seat belt has been broken. Colonel, please come back! Colonel, come back! Colonel, come back! I... I'll go out. Hwang Seon-woo. What are you doing? I'm about to open the door! With this pressure, how can I open it? If open... you will be sucked out, Even though you won't be able to open it. Stop it, please. I only had about 15 seconds of oxygen left. Seon-woo. Hwang Seon-woo. Now I... I can't see anything in front of my eyes. Colonel, I'll do my best to get out. Colonel, it's not possible, please. Don't do that. Why not? Are you planning on bringing my body back? Even though you could return with my body, then that just adds more trouble. - Colonel, don't do that... - From now on... From now on, follow my orders. Impossible. After... After I die... Impossible! Are not! Communication will be reconnected. Are not! - Ask for help! - Don't be like that, Colonel! And Seon-woo ah... Final... This is not an order, but a suggestion. Stop it. Hwang Seon-woo's crew. Colonel, no, no! Are not! Colonel! Colonel! Impossible! Colonel! Colonel, no way! Colonel! Are not! Colonel! Head of Center! Signal is being reconnected! All signals from both sides are connected. I am the center leader. Hwang Seon-woo, are you okay? If you hear me, answer me! I report! At a distance of 30,000 kilometers on the moon, We had a solar storm. Both the command module and the ship... all have problems. Colonel Lee Sang-won... went out to repair the communication antenna. After fixing the antenna, there is a problem with the output. The power supply is reduced and... pressure increases. Because of the fuel tank explosion... Captain Cho Yun-jong has... Unable to receive body signals... by Colonel Lee Sang-won. To save captain Cho Yun-jong from an accident, Colonel Lee Sang-won... - was... - Crew Hwang Seon-woo. We have grasped the situation. You don't need to say any more. Keep calm. I'm the only one who's okay. I'm sorry! Really sorry! Until we give feedback, and get back in touch, Please check the system again, that's all. Yes, I get it. Two people are dead, and one is alive. But the remaining members... Can't fly a spaceship. That is the person who was discharged from the army as the most outstanding member of UDT. Physically strong and very resilient. If he followed instructions carefully,... Is it time to talk about fitness? Don't remember the mess from 5 years ago? What did I say at the beginning? Withdraw from the Space Federation. Fighting through technology? Creating precious feng shui land in the future? Come on... It just costs more and more money. Minister! Our development costs only 1/5 of the requested funding amount. So that's why it's dictatorial. We understand. Okay, take him home. Cancel all our activities. No, not canceled, but failed. So just bring him home. At least one person has to be saved. But what will the public say now? The problem is that if you want to bring the ship back to Earth, we need to get rid of the command module. But now, after the solar storm incident, The remote removal device has been paralyzed. Then fix it. Who is the best in this field? It's impossible to find the best. Must find the person who produced it. Producers understand it best. Woori command module Copied from Narai. The head of design is the former Director and Technical Commander who directs two members. Dr. Hwang Gyu-tae for accepting responsibility for the failure 5 years ago, has ended his own life. So what about someone else? There are two people, right? Right? The previous head of the center. Where's that person? Bring that person here. If we stay here in this far away windy and snowy weather, Aren't we going to die? Then the helicopter will be brought here. If someone dies. So be quiet. But captain, if we keep quiet and say nothing, we will die. Can't we make a fire? If you were a wild boar, do you want to come before the people, Are you talking around the fire? If you want to eat meat, think carefully. Look straight ahead. It's come. Come for real! Shoot away! Shoot away! Just shoot! Captain, what are you doing? I forgot to give ammo. I forgot. They look like a family. That's a wild boar, isn't it? Let's just leave quietly. Should I run? Run? Run, run, run! Run fast! Don't run, don't run, I told you not to run. Have they gone yet? Then isn't it? SOBAEK . MOUNTAIN OBSERVATION The Woori ship flies into space with Korea's dream, but encountered a solar storm that killed two people. Up to now, regarding the incident... Even with the loss of the command module, one can still survive for a while. Ask NASA for help. And go back. We tried asking NASA for help., but you must have known about this expedition opposed by NASA. If they refuse our offer, It is also impossible to convince. Please help us bring at least one person back. Head of Center! Please help us. Head of Center. If you want to save at least one person, then please go back. Please help us. This is what he did five years ago. It's just a mission for me. He is the son of Dr. Hwang Gyu-tae, the technical director five years ago. If he can succeed this time, it will be a resounding success. Yes, the entire population is deeply regretful. So in this situation, What do we need to do first, doc? Survive! Hwang Seon-woo must survive. In this time, - whether the module is fixed or not is the most important. - Sorry. I am an intern here. What center is he the head of? Bank? I will complete... my father's unfinished dream. - Hwang Seon-woo knows that Dr. Hwang is watching... - Yes I hear? Yes. It was Dr. Hwang Gyu-tae's son. Thank you for sharing. I believe my father is watching over me from heaven. I believe he will help me. I will do my best to complete the mission. I won't disappoint you, and will be back with good news. The crew's condition is getting worse. Hwang Seon-woo's body temperature was continuously dropping. There is a problem with the heating equipment. If the temperature continues to decrease, the entire command module system will malfunction. How's the power installation going? It started working intermittently 30 minutes ago. Why didn't you tell me? We are finding out the cause. I'm sorry. How are you now? What's the problem again? Huh? Who made the mistake? Who is? Who is it? I told you not to do anything before the former center head arrived, right? Who is that? Why are you here? Who is he? Former center head. Head of Center... How's PTC mode? PTC MODE IS A SYSTEM THAT RECEIVES SOLAR HEAT EVENLY ON THE ROTTING BODY OF THE SPACESHIP How's PTC mode? It stopped working when the output machine exploded. How much will the temperature increase if we change direction towards the sun? More than 5 degrees. How long until the moon? At this rate, about 30 minutes. 30 minutes is enough. Enter simulation execution data. But... Hurry up! One output machine is lost. If done wrong, it will disappear into the universe. So you want him to freeze to death? Anyway, if you want to get to the moon, you have to change direction. So change as quickly as possible. Start the output machine and report me the calculation. Contact. Hwang Seon-woo. Did you hear? From now on, we will reposition the module. You just have to do what I say. We need to fix the detector first to push it into lunar orbit. Then there is no need to fix it in the future. And it can reach lunar orbit successfully. Can you do it? Yes, I will try. Rotate it to a position where sunlight can reach the module. Then the temperature will increase without using a heater. You will feel better. PTC mode can also try to work. Now, if you're ready, then let's get started. Do you see the recoil control system on the control panel? Yes, I did see it. Here is the data. Let's make it work. Yes. Because of the recent incident, so we lost part of the propeller. Only propeller numbers 2 and 3 can be used. Use the signal from me to activate propeller #2 for 2 seconds, with 20% thrust. Yes, it's clear. Propeller number 2. Thrust 20%. 2 sec. Ready. Propeller countdown number 2. Year, four, father, two, one. Begin. Begin! Anti-control system starts after 2 seconds. CSM is active. Woori is turning backwards. Turn on manual mode. Propeller number 3, 2.5 seconds, start. 2.5 seconds, start. The detector position has been successfully corrected. Redirect completed. The data is stable. Normal condition. The relative quantity of data is also stable. The module temperature is also increasing. Woori has arrived in a safe orbit at the moon's north pole. Currently, the moon's orbit appears to be uneventful. It's safe. PTC mode has started successfully and the detector rotation speed is now stable. This is PTC's report. First, maintain normal mode. That's Kim Jae-kook, the former head of the center. He is the designer of Narai. When Dr. Kim worked for Nasa, I worked very hard to get him here. I'm not curious about that. I just want to know if he can save the astronaut. There is nothing more important than that. I don't need to know anything else. Hwang Seon-woo, it's been hard work. Now Woori has entered the back of the moon. We'll lose the signal. You can rest until we reconnect. When we return to the moon again, we will make further adjustments. Run out of. Wait. May I ask if... the location and full name of the person on the transmission line? Kim Jae-kook. Five years ago, I worked with your father. Astronaut Hwang Seon-woo. You know me. CHO YUN-JONG LEE SANG-WON You haven't named your daughter yet? Yes, I was just thinking about it. Moldy solar storm! Ah, that name? I'll think about it when I get to the moon. I like to think of it when I look at the Earth. That said, Nasa didn't accept our help, did she? Doctor. Isn't there an American space station in lunar orbit? That's not easy. The universe is not like a square. There's no place like a rest stop on the highway. Hello? Hello? Yes, here I am. It's been a while, hasn't it? The thing is... Is Jae-min still doing well in school? What school is the boy going to? Where? Well, you're still the same. Captain. - I'm still looking at the stars at the observatory... - Captain. - You have to go now. - Did you hear me? You say it. I want to ask you a few things. Is it possible? Except for your side's exploration accident, I will answer everything. You say it. Moon-young. Are you... participate in the rescue project? Are you at the Space Center? Is it? - Listen carefully. - No... My Lunar Space Station will arrive in the vicinity of the Woori in 48 hours. From now until then, I will repair the Woori... Listen carefully. - Now... - I heard you! The survivor is Gyu-tae's son, Hwang Seon-woo. - I know the boy too. - I hear you clearly, Kim Jae-kook. I heard you say this. Lunar stations are also affected by the solar wind. No part is working properly. To fix it, we stayed up for 2 days. No one here understands this. Asking for help at this time is a waste of effort. Even if your President makes an official request, the answer will still be the same. Do you understand? Please, help me... Wife... Impossible. And the last thing I want to say is... If you can rescue him, that would be great. I also sincerely hope so. Even so, Gyu-tae won't come back. I turn it off here. They said they would separate the Response Module. Star? It will land on the Moon. Everyone is crazy! Hurry hurry! Woori ship, prepare to separate. Check operation. Check EVA items, standard signals. Pls okay. Complete check of oxygen supply. Reconfirm the Response Module startup. Check the Module thrust. Checked. Normal control system. Environmental system testing is complete. Disassembled at an altitude of 100km above the Moon. Current angle confirmation is complete. If you do this then I can't help you. Not our decision. Stop this now! It's not we who decide! It's Hwang Seon-woo. Hwang Seon-woo decides for himself! How could he fly the Landing Module himself? Has everyone lost their minds? We can't stop him. In addition, he also knows about the separation of the lander on the Moon and back to the Command Module are all on autopilot. Open the communication channel. Hwang Seon-woo. This is Kim Jae-kook. The Lunar Station will arrive at your location in 2 days. Then you can dock with them. Let's wait until then. What if it doesn't work? They can refuse to let us dock. For many reasons... Our ship's condition is bad. Then uncle... will repair the defective part of the Command Module. I will reboot in 2 days. Then the system will operate normally. Everyone will bring you back. So please cancel the separation procedure! Hurry up! What if it can't be fixed within 2 days? You failed with the Narae train. Are you sure you can fix it? Cancel detachment! Dr. Kim Jae-kook. Why should I give my life to you? Doctor... I can't even protect my father. Isn't that right? Naro Center, please listen to me. Pull him out. Even if the Lunar station comes to the rescue, or the Command Module is repaired, it takes 2 days. I'll use that time for the two lost teammates up here, for me,... and for those who died five years ago, and for our country. Prepare the landing sequence. Complete report. Well, now I'm standing in front of the Naro Center. This will be the site of the historic moment, witnessing the second person on the Woori spacecraft landing on the moon... Captain, I have a question. Did you check the meteor shower coordinates? I keep checking the IAU website. Watch carefully for me. Report immediately if you discover anything. As for the questions, leave them later. Now I have to figure out how to fix the Command Module. Okay. Just a little more, we will see the first Korean set foot on the Moon. THERE WILL BE THE FIRST KOREAN ASTRONAUT TO SET FOOT ON THE MOON Updates on the vessel's current status and estimates... It is known that Korea's Woori spacecraft encountered an explosion, killing two astronauts. The spacecraft will attempt to land on the Moon. The sole survivor on board, astronaut Hwang Seon-woo... Final confirmation for the lander. Unlock confirmation. - Ecall. - Ecall. Go. - GNC. - GNC. Go. - Orientation. - Orientation. Go. Backup, OK. Medical OK. Executive, OK. EECOM, OK. ECALL, OK. Data, OK. Check that final disassembly has been completed. Woori ship, can proceed to disassemble. 5. 4. 3. 2. first. Cup. Cup! Cup. Device is unlocking and detaching. The automatic system is operating normally. The A module descends in altitude. Dr. Kim Jae-wook, NASA senior researcher on water 14 years ago for Korea's first lunar exploration mission. Korea's space technology at that time was very rudimentary. Thanks to Dr. Kim Jae-wook and local researchers... The pairing model was successful as expected. The split test was also successful. BSM insulation design is also good. Except for the new scale fitting flight model, real scale modeling is also progressing on schedule. Thanks to the researchers who didn't give up, after a lot of efforts and trials, DREAM OF EXPLORE THE MOON BEGINS 40 YEARS AGO they brought the spaceship Woori. The Woori ship was launched into the sky and one step closer to the Moon. Seniors. CHALLENGE TO UNIVERSITY This is my son. She is studying physics.

You have worked hard! - Good job. - Great! We just received the news Woori spacecraft successfully landed on the Moon. Korea becomes the second country set foot on the moon. Hwang Seon-woo from South Korea will collect ice cubes at Shackleton on the Moon. Hwang will take samples from water and hydrogen sources to explore the possibility of using lunar resources. Launched a drone to probe Maru. Maru's camera works fine. Has 3 hours of operation, confirm operating time. Korean citizens, today is a historic day as we reach beyond the Earth. Now, the universe is within our reach. To be able to set foot on the Moon only by my own strength, We have gone through countless difficulties and failures. Today... marks an important milestone, Show an unyielding spirit in the face of all trials and tribulations, determined to keep going and our steadfast will. Hopefully astronaut Hwang Seon-woo can complete the mission and return safely to Earth. I hope everyone will pray for him. Today, as a representative of the Korean government, I officially request cooperation from the United States help bring Hwang Seon-woo safe return at any cost. In the remaining time, I need everyone to restore this nitrogen valve, position module fix, this module. And here... Please reinstall automatic navigation. We have 5 hours until Hwang Seon-woo returns after collecting stones. Not enough time and no need to restore every system. I will check the total recovery code. Start. This is Hwang Seon-woo. Now I will start the main quest. 89.9,0.01. Please confirm the coordinates. The coordinates have been entered. Maru status is fine, working well. The car's battery is 98%. Come on, let's go find resources. As one can see, all functions of the Station including the manubrium are back to normal except for the robot arm. And of course, the use of the robotic arm is not necessary during docking with the Woori Command Module requested by Korea. So we won't use it anyway. Furthermore, the robot arm will be repaired on time The station entered an orbit at an altitude of 140 km around the lunar surface where the Woori spacecraft landed. Are there any special offers from your country? Oh, but surely no offer can be attractive enough for the future director of NASA. The head of the Narae ship surveillance is your ex-husband, right? Director. It wasn't me, it was the White House that asked. This... is my husband. Meteor shower data sent from neocamp is heading towards the Moon. I've warned Lunar Station. Therefore... Pay special attention to possible damage. Reach the main quest area. Confirm EVA entries. PLSS and oxymeter are still good. Confirm. Naro Center, report. I'm moving to the center of Shackleton Crater. The anterior pit is obscured. Astronaut Hwang Seon-woo. It is the near boundary of the Moon. If it goes through that, the temperature will drop to minus 160 degrees Celsius. Be careful. Yes, I know. Enter the main mission area. Drone Maru is analyzing the drilling site. Check the quest location and confirm the side quest. Doctor, if this mission succeeds, The US-led Space Commission would have a hard time excluding Korea from the Commission, wouldn't it? Yes, that's right. The most important is... Earth has Antarctica, we have Sejeong station there. What if we built a base on the Moon? Are you referring to resources? That's right. According to the Outer Space Treaty, countries explore the Moon has territorial ownership over it. And we are doing it. Surely ISL is very worried right now. From this point of view, Hwang Seon-woo currently at the South Pole of the Moon. Although it can be considered the Moon's South Pole, but the situation is completely different. And where he is on duty are two completely different places. Naro Center, report. I have arrived at the mission area. Start drilling. There is unfortunate news. Proposal from the Korean government about the berthing of the Woori ship... Was rejected. You will receive an official response through - diplomatic channels... - What is the reason? Can I ask the reason? US time, this morning, the NEO Surveyor space observatory is in Halo orbit discovered a meteor shower. It seems to be due to the influence of the solar wind. The scale is quite large. Which direction? Meteor shower? The far side of the Moon. If so, then... Captain. Ask the Meteorological Department for assistance. - Captain, talk to me... - More info on meteor showers... - Just a moment. - What about the Bureau of Meteorology? Hwang Seon-woo is collecting rock samples. Can check main task progress. 3rd main quest, completed. 3rd side quest in standby mode. FOD confirms the request. I think you guys should get the astronauts back to the Command Module as soon as possible. Just that. Take him back to the main ship. Why? The meteor shower is on the far side of the Moon. He is on the border between far and near. He'll be fine there. Get out, let go of me. - Stay away. - Impossible! Let me go! - Stay away! - I can't. What a... Naro Center, Hwang Seon-woo reported. I have 2 good news. Good news? That's good news. From the hidden pit, I have collected the tape. Already in the sample tube. What's the good news left? Director, didn't he say he had 2 good news? What's the rest of the good news? The meteor shower on the far side of the Moon has ended. Haven't seen any movement in the last 2 minutes. I think everyone can rest assured. Motion detected. Moon Earthquake. Quick check. - Hwang Seon-woo, run! - What's going on? Meteor shower detected! Meteor shower! Check out the meteor shower range! Stop the mission! Meteor shower detected! Warning EVA! Quick move! Hwang Seon-woo, quickly return to the Landing Bay! Back to the Answer Box! Maru! Lead me to the Answer Room! Naro Center, I will now move to the Landing Pod! Confirm move to the Landing Cabin. According to ZHR and coordinate calculation, meteor shower may fall on Hwang Seon-woo's location! Naro Center! Ask for the projected collision coordinates of the meteor shower! This! Have you run the test yet? There's no more time. Restart the Command Module software. Impossible. What if the power does not return? Even so... if the Command Module isn't on standby, it's all over! So you have to test first! Manager! A huge meteorite is falling towards Shackleton crater! Oh my God. From MP12365 with love! Was he hit by a meteorite? What's going on? Rebuild and reboot the Command Module software! But... Hurry up! What are you still doing? Restart the Command Module. I will take responsibility. Hurry up! The Command Module System is off. Restart the system. Restarting. Maru, come to my place! I can't go out! Naro Center, emergency evacuation!

Seon-woo, Hwang Seon-woo. Answer me! Seon-woo, Hwang Seon-woo. NO SIGNAL Lost contact. Hwang Seon-woo's life support system equipment signal has been lost. Oh my God. Early this morning, Naro lost contact with Hwang Seon-woo while coming back Command Module after complete mission. All communication with the Woori ship was cut off for 4 hours. The accident happened after Mr. Hwang successfully extracted an ice sample. This makes the tragedy even more painful. The accident happened just after 9:30 a.m after landing. There is no information about Mr. Hwang's life yet. But experts are pessimistic. It's been 4 hours since the communication channel was cut off. The problem is oxygen depletion. What are his chances of survival? The far side of the Moon has a temperature of -160 degrees Celsius, so the battery and fuel will drain much faster. What about the Green House? At this rate, in the next hour, the president will probably give a condolence speech. What about me? What do I do now? I have already prepared the content of the press conference. You just need to read along. Say my regards and then send him home. Someone else who knew the former Director was involved it will be very complicated. However, South Korea lost contact with the last remaining astronaut, Hwang Seon-woo. During the press conference of the Ministry of Science and Technology, information was announced that a meteorite impact during connection of the Module is the cause of the ship falling. It's a pity that we couldn't protect them. We will always remember the astronauts What are you planning to do with that crappy gun? Can you give me some sleeping pills? I took about 200 pills Then maybe one time you can fly to the Moon. Is that Okay? Did you load the ammo this time? Drop it down. Please, child. Drop what? Captain, are you crazy? Captain, look at this. Hurry up! Hwang Seon-woo is still alive. GA88-6AFN-LK88-ZG5Y This is the access code for the American CEO satellite on the far side of the Moon. I can only help so much, good luck! Mayday. I'm Hwang Seon-woo. Did you hear? I am Korean astronaut, Hwang Seon-woo. Did you hear what I said? Mayday. Do you hear? Hurry up! MAIN OBSERVATION ROOM GA88 6AFN LK88JG5Y TO CONNECTED Mayday. Mayday. Okay! I am Korean astronaut, Hwang Seon-woo. I had an accident behind the Moon. Listen again from the beginning. I had an accident behind the Moon. Seon-woo, Hwang Seon-woo. Hwang Seon-woo, are you listening? Hwang Seon-woo, I am Dr. Kim Jae-kook. I had an accident behind the Moon. Why can't he hear my voice? During the Moon landing, Why couldn't he hear my voice? During the landing on the Moon, The signal is wrong. Switch the signal first! I took advantage of the thrust and landed on the Campbell impact crater, The incident occurred behind the Moon. Please respond. I had an accident behind the Moon. Wait a minute. I had an accident behind the Moon. Wait a minute. I have this idea. The incident occurred while on duty due to a meteor shower. Did you hear? Did you hear? Hwang Seon-woo, did you hear that? I am Dr. Kim Jae-kook. If you hear it, please answer me. Seon-woo. Seon-woo. Hwang Seon-woo Do you hear? I'm Kim Jae-kook. What is the current situation? I'm on the surface of Campbell impact crater behind the moon. I made an emergency landing. I know. Are you okay? I'm fine. How is the ship? I have reduced oxygen levels. Remaining 40%. Only 5 hours left! Ammonia leak problem solved. To save electricity, I turned off the ignition. I can't determine the situation outside. Should I go out and check? Meteors are still falling, right? That's right. Still falling. Don't go out! Don't step foot outside, okay? Don't go out until the meteor stops falling. The information signal has been restored. Can the signal be received at the center? Here not the center. Why is that helicopter here? Isn't there only one way? Let's go! There's this one more. I'll upload it to YouTube and then add tragic music. Maybe it will go viral there. Because the oxygen concentration is low to save energy he can sleep. If he sleeps, he will die. Get order. Captain! Heart attack! Heart attack! I apologize for being late. Captain? YES. Sorry. Didn't you say he fainted? Because of a heart attack. Damn it... I'm sorry. We're just going to save people. Where? Where is that person? On the moon. The moon... the moon? That's right. Moon? Hwang Seon-woo is still alive. Look, he's still alive! In the posted video, astronaut Hwang Seon-woo sent a distress signal. The video quickly became the center of attention. In the 1-minute video, Hwang Seon-woo can be heard trying to connect the signal for help ONLY 40% OXI remains and the exact location where the ship crashed. ONLY 5 HOURS left! Although the authenticity of the video is still being clarified... Solved the problem of ammonia leakage, to save electricity... Solved the problem of ammonia leakage, to save electricity... Hello, Mr. Hwang Seon-woo. HE IS STILL ALIVE! CURRENT VIEWS Hwang Seon-woo, aren't you sleeping? I don't sleep. I can not sleep. What's wrong with your voice? Don't worry about me. I know, so I don't oversleep SEARCH: WHANG SEON-WOO. SPECIAL FORCE: HWANG SEON-WOO I will ask you a few questions. Special Search Team... Why did you join UDT? I heard that place is very difficult. Even if my arm is broken, I can't make a sound. TRAINING WITHOUT SLEEP, OUTSIDE DIVING, EXPLOSIONING, RECONCILIATION, TACTICS AND TRAINING SURVIVAL SKILLS AND TACTICAL KNOWLEDGE... Let me guess why you went there? Can you help me quietly for a moment? "I want to know where the end of my pain is." Through rigorous training, TRAINING WITHOUT SLEEP, OUTSIDE DIVING, EXPLOSIONING, RECONCILIATION, TACTICS AND TRAINING SURVIVAL SKILLS AND TACTICAL KNOWLEDGE... pushing mental and physical pain to the end then you won't think about any other pain. Because humans only feel the greatest pain. NARAI LAUNCH FAILED Did you join because of your father? Why did my father have to go through so much suffering? Is it right? Seon-woo, did you know? We are very similar. We are the common denominator. My family was also very miserable after losing my father. Common denominator? Stop it. Don't judge other people's things when you don't know anything. Do you like to be nosy that much? "I want to fulfill my father's dream" Son of the late Huang Gyu-tae Video of Hwang Seon-woo signaling for help when there is a problem is becoming a topic of debate on social networking platforms. The video has received 2.5 million views... The security code changes every six hours. And only you, me and the astronauts know. Who do you think did this? The place to post the video is not in the center but So Baek Mountain. Please hand over your phone. Check calls, messages and files on her computer. Director. The White House wants to talk to you. He's waiting outside. Signal received! The communication signal is also connected. The autopilot system is still normal. Fuel remaining two hours. There are no abnormalities in the navigation system. There are no problems with the ignition. This is the Nalo Space Center Korea. Hwang Seon-woo, please answer me. Do you hear me? If you hear it, please respond. I'm Hwang Seon-woo. Signal received. The video signal seems to only work with one internal camera. Hwang Seon-woo, please report the ship's internal condition. What are you guys doing? Huh? I ask what are you going to do? Hwang Seon-woo is still alive. You're the one who uploaded that video to YouTube, right? BECAUSE of that, Cheong Wa Dae is in complete chaos. I had to appear in front of the president and cry to appease the people. But you guys say Hwang Seon-woo is still alive? How about alive? Now even more confused, they demanded to save him. Didn't we abandon him? If you want to save, you can't save! How can you save someone who is on the Moon? You want a second funeral? Another meteor shower! The hull of the ship is being impacted. Just move to a safer place first. Is there a safe place in the universe? Center Head Jeong, you say go. Is there a safe place in the universe? You're going to blame the US for saying more, aren't you? I am they can not that! They can't go in the middle of that meteor shower! Minister! The Lunar Space Station has approved the request to search for the ship. The White House has also just held an emergency meeting to make an emergency relief decision. What are people still standing there doing? Do you want to contact NASA? They are waiting there! Mr. Park also hurry up! The US side is also having a headache right now. Videos on YouTube are on the top trending and the American people simultaneously demanded: "Save Hwang Seon-woo". "What the hell is the space agency doing?" The White House website is also down! Who posted that video? How can I post it? I don't know either. Alright! [URGENT NEWS] THE AEROSPACE ADMINISTRATION WORKS WITH NASA TO Rescue HWANG SEON-WOO This is the Houston checkpoint. Please report a mission in progress. This is Sergent James Gren of the Lunar Space Station. We have adjusted the trajectory to shorten the distance with the Woori ship. Confirm. The new mission will start at 15:40 UTC. Pay attention to the altitude above sea level. The docking will be done at an altitude of 100KM above the moon. We searched Yoon Moon-young's office and confiscated personal computers for investigation. As soon as there is evidence of information disclosure, the disciplinary council will work immediately. Then this will be her last mission. Monitor her closely. The Lunar space station will approach the Nopil impact crater in a few minutes. The automatic navigation feature will be taken over and executed when the mission begins. According to previous agreement, when the ship is more than 100 km vertically above the ground We will begin the rescue. Please take control of the automatic navigation system and maintain communication between the two parties. Again, if something goes wrong this mission fails then there will be no more chances. If you're ready, count down. I am ready. Groups please confirm information. RETRO, confirmed. Data, validation. Biomonitoring, validation. System, confirm. Control and confirmation system. System program, confirm. - Data, confirmation. - RETRO, confirmed. Countdown begins! ten. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. Maximize energy. 3. 2. first. Wait! Start the engine! Are not. No no... Stop. Cancel the order, Hwang Seon-woo! Hwang Seon-woo, cancel the order quickly! The navigation system is not working. The force acting on the hull is too great. The port is not working. Thrust port number 9 is broken. Disable the power supply. Disable response control system.. Report the situation. There is no signal from the autopilot. The response control system has been completely disabled. Unable to control. What about the connection port? What about the connection port? Connector... was completely broken. Which means we can't control the ship anymore. It's not happened. So is there any other way? The mission reception center couldn't wait any longer. Please repeat. At this rate, we can't wait any longer. If you do not change the trajectory, it will be very dangerous. We cannot maintain the slow pace and wait any longer. We require orbital redirection. Please wait for confirmation from Supervisor. Jennifer. Confirm, initiate orbital redirection. Move closer to the Moon. The biosecurity system has been turned off. I quit. Hwang Seon-woo. What are you doing? There is still a lot of oxygen left. Just change the automatic control to manual. No. We have done all we can. The oxygen valve is closed. This kid, You look exactly like your father. Yes, that's right. I don't want to like dad. But it looks like I have to. I'm sorry. It's not your father's fault. So open the oxygen valve again immediately. Hurry up! You don't know about my father, do you? One month before the Narai incident, He knew there was a problem with the ship's engine. SEND SEON-WOO Dad knows everything but still let the Narai train to depart. He didn't tell anyone about it. Oh no, it's impossible to say. Dad hid it. It seems dad just wants to be more successful. I never begged everyone to forgive my father. But I will speak the truth on behalf of my father. Last time, thank you everyone. I will turn off the intercom. Seon-woo. Hwang Seon-woo. Do not turn off the intercom! I... I... I also have something to say. One day before the Narai train incident, Your father came to find me. He told me that there was a problem with Narai's engine. And said that if it continues, it will be very dangerous. He asked for a delay of 2 months to fix it. He pleaded like that. But I refused. Of course, the reason is because the probability of an incident occurring is very low but the biggest reason why I refused that request It is because the lunar survey has been delayed five times. If you continue to delay then everything will collapse. Maybe because I was so hungry for success. I don't ask people for forgiveness, but... You... you are... You must forgive him. So come back. Seon-woo, come back and forgive my father. I beg you. The oxygen valve has been reactivated. Astronaut Hwang Sun-woo ready to take on the task. Yoon Moon-young Have you seen satellite images? It is in another location. Impacting on the impact crater, as long as there is thrust, it can take off. Try it first. Different from before, the slope supports both sides so starting is possible. So let's try that first. If you stay there, you will be affected by the meteor shower. Where to fly? Now there is no way to connect to Gateway. The ship's connection was completely broken. To the surface of the Moon. The locomotive is now facing the Moon. Let's land on the Moon first. The front part of the train... Assuming the engine can be started, how do you ensure that the spacecraft will land in front of the Moon? Now we have no control. The ship cannot operate on its own. That's up to you to figure it out. You can do it. Do you understand? I will do everything I can here. Found her. But what she just said Has it been approved by NASA? This is the last thing NASA can do. I'm going. How much fuel is left? 30 minutes at rest and 4 minutes when maximum thrust is applied. That's enough! Connect the communication system. Prepare to take off. Yes. Hwang Seon-woo. Prepare to take off. Where do you go? We're going back to the front of the Moon. Is it possible? The front of the Moon? Seon-woo. Can you manually reboot the ship's systems? I can. Alright. Okay, everyone, please follow my orders. Jennifer! Jennifer, open the door! Open the door! Stop her! Stop her now! Confirm information. Confirm the IC system. Ground control, prepare for takeoff. Hwang seon-woo, are you ready? Ready. The main engine is ready to start. 3 2 1 Start up! Start up! All engines are started. Determine the location of the impact crater. The target orbit is 100 km from the moon. 51m straight flight speed. Horizontal speed 304 meters. As you know, the mission to rescue Korean astronauts failed. However, astronaut Hwang Seon-woo piloted the damaged ship himself and is approaching the Moon. William Johns, born in Birmingham, England. Julie Anderson, from Quebec, Canada. Andy Walker, from Melbourne, Australia. And Sergeant James Green from Montana, USA. Even though you come from different countries, I believe you will agree... Open the door! Jennifer! Open the door now! We are not simply individuals, we are a collective of astronauts.

Our country has become the ninth member Join the Aerospace Union... Really big. Anyway, it's fake, why borrow something that big? Not for the captain. It's for me to wear, don't worry about it. Yoon Moon-young of South Korea has been appointed controller of the space agency NASA. She is the first woman appointed to this position. Before, - Yoon Moon-young used to be a NASA supervisor... - Oh my god... After rescuing astronaut Hwang Seon-woo Yoon Moon-young was disciplined and suspended from work. The surprising thing is that after being disciplined, she was chosen to be the head of NASA. The White House said that Yoon Moon-young is the person with the greatest contribution in this spectacular rescue. The humane values ​​that Yoon Moon-young brings makes the whole world admire and admire. That's why they made the unprecedented decision in history... Little friends! Yes! Not long ago, where in the universe did our country fly? Moon! That's right, it's the Moon! Today, I specially introduce to you the costumes that astronauts wear when exploring space. Space suit! I will show you the little ones! If you want to see it, clap your hands! Han-byul. It's an astronaut! Do not touch! Do you feel beautiful? Thank you teacher. Do not touch! Are not... It's so rotten!
