Not enough fiber in their diet. Aren't we funny. Give me a break Kate, I'm tired. Then why don't we talk about you taking some time off? Let's not and pretend we did. Come on, Mancuso. What at you looking at? That thing around your neck. Since when did you wear jewelry? You're not allowed to touch my jewels anymore Kate, remember? Pardon me, but I really don't want to anymore. You know Jonathan, I'm serious. Take a week or two, go fishing or something. I'm fine. Haven't you heard cops carry a lot of baggage? People carry a lot of baggage period. But when it starts to affect them like this. Will you quit worrying over me like some mother hen, besides, it's not becoming in a lady police captain. Don't give me that chauvinistic crap. When we partnered together, I kicked ass, step for step with you and I did it backwards and in heels. Relax, relax Kate. I didn't mean anything, I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Come on, Mancuso.

No, it isn't Jonathan. That's just your rationalization. Is this one of those double-meaning conversations? You know, where we think we're talking about me playing by the rules, but what we're really talking about is you and I breaking up, right? No. Ancient history. We tried it, it didn't work. You found a slut to make you happy. End of story. You're not harboring any bad feelings about it at all. Absolutely not. We had a difference of opinion. I think handcuffs have a purpose and binding sex partners isn't one of them. And see, all this time I thought the reason we broke up was because you didn't trust what was between us. And so I wouldn't let you handcuff me to the bed? The reason we broke up is that we never talked especially about anything important. All we did was stayed in bed all day. You know, give it a break. I didn't say you're any good. Well, you never complained. What's wrong? Nothing. There is some graffiti on the outside wall. I need a shot of that too. Uh-huh. This is nice, huh?

Just forget it Kate. It is not important. Alright, Graves that's it. Now tell me why we need those shots and what the hell is wrong with you or I'm taking you off this case. You got that detective? I'm serious Jonathan, talk! What's bothering me is that all the guards are gone and I don't think they had anything to do with this. I mean, the door is blown in, the silent was tripped, and not much was taken. If it were the guards, they had all night to clear out the entire place. And the graffiti? It's not graffiti exactly. It's an ancient pictorial language called Zoren. Zoren. from the book of the dead. Basically it translates into to live again you must kill yourself. Jonathan. Kate, now, what's your problem? An ancient language-- Kate, I'm serious. But you... you could barely speak English. How in hell do you know an ancient language? Okay, alright. You're right. I was just kidding. Ha ha ha!

Alright, I need to ask you this. Please don't get mad, Were there any witnesses? Jonathan, were there any witnesses? No. No. No! Good. Did you know they found the curator's car last night? It was burned to a crisp. The doors were all locked, and there was no sign of a body anywhere. e telling me your partner is beating the shit out of you and you can't explain it other than to say he wasn't in his right mind? I mean, Jonathan, just tell me, should I put a ball out on him or what is it a criminal action, did he intend to kill you or it was just a misunderstanding? You know, boys being boys. Just give me some details here I can work with. Whoa, what are you doing? Foust, great keeper of the night, appear now and share this sacrifice with me. Foust, my dear.

Tell me, who possesses the jewel of knowledge? She possesses it. Where is she? I promise I'll find the jewel, Foust. I'll search them until I'm dead. Death will be a blessing to you if you fail me again. Remember Alexandra, there are far, far worse things in the beyond and if I fade into the abyss, I swear I will take you with me. You got something to say to me? Good, 'cause I'm really not in the mood. Just like the old times, huh? Still a model of good housekeeping, I see. What do you think? sure thgonnan be some action here?

Works for me man. Come on let's get going. Alright. There you go. I'm in. Okay, come on. Give me a hand, alright. I'm in. still sleeping. So, no one's found Mancuso yet? Jonathan is not going anywhere so it's really not that big a deal. Just keep checking his apartment and see if you can find him, alright? I gotta go. Who the hell are you? Jeanine Michaels. Jonathan's slut. And you must be Katie, or is it Catty? You do know I'm a police Captain, don't you? Congratulations. I'm sure your mother is thrilled. I could have you arrested. For what? Being hotter in bed than you were? I'm sorry, that was mean. Look, we don't have to do this little territorial dance. I just wanna check on Jonathan and return something I borrowed that I forgot I had. How do you know he was hurt? Word travels fast on the streets. e a cop, didn't you ever heard that, hon? Quit calling me hon, hon. Where are you going? Ease up, dirty Harriet I'm just gonna check on Jonathan. He is sleeping, he needs the rest. Damn. Pimps can be so demanding. You can use a payphone. Yeah, okay, whatever. I'm not gonna fight with you. Just remember something, my panties are in his laundry basket these days, hon, because I give Jonathan what he wants, rough and dangerous, like he likes it. Just spare me the disgusting details, alright. not interested in where your panties have been, shocked you wear any. Oh really. e not interested? Sure you're not. Couldn't care less, we're just friends. Whatever you are, hon, e not just friends. Such a pretty, pretty girl. Just Jonathan's type. We need a female sacrifice. Bring her to the altar, so that I may bridge the two worlds. As you wish. Hurry Alexandra, Hurry. I'll probably be here for another couple of hours. Yeah, yeah, you told me that. Is there anything else I should know? Oh, I'll call you back. Jeez, Jonathan. Kate, what are you doing here? Look out the window. At what? There was a woman in a black leather outfit. She was dragging your slut across the street. Jeanine. The jewel, she must have taken it. That ugly red thing? Yeah, she was... Where are you going, Jonathan? ♪ music Jonathan? Open up! Open up! You were gonna shoot my car, weren't you, Kate? Don't lie, I know, I was there, I saw it. Just tell me e going. Hochstatter Mental Facility. Why? 'Cause I think that's where we're gonna find Jeanine. And you think this because... Oh, God. Litter bug. Idiot. So you're saying... The woman you saw carrying Jeanine away is an old girlfriend of mine from a long time ago named Alexandra. We were pretty wild when we were going together. We did lot of experimenting, drugs, weird sex, ritualistic stuff, you name it, we did it. Ritualistic stuff, like what? Black magic, devil worship. Devil worship? Like I said, it was a long time ago, long before I was even a cop. Anyway, it got to be too much for me so I broke it off, but you know, she couldn't stop. Finally one night, she went over the deep end and tried to kill me. That's when I had to have her committed. I didn't know until last night that she had escaped. She was in the warehouse when Mancuso attacked me. I think she intends to kill Jeanine as a sacrifice. And why do you think this? It's a little harder to explain. She serves an entity she calls Foust, a darker side of me. There someone out there who thinks you have a darker side? You think this is funny, don't you? No, I don't Jonathan. It's just a little hard to absorb all at once. So, go on. Well, she can't make Foust real until she separates him from me. That's why she needs the jewel to make that happen. And Foust, I suppose, looks just like you? I assume so. And she wants to sacrifice Jeanine to make Foust real so he can do what? Kill me and love her again. We can't exist together, as I fade, he becomes real just like now I'm real and he is not. That's it. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I better call for backup. God damn it, Jonathan. Pull over so I can use a phone. Is she armed, do you know? dangerous, I know that. She loves the taste of blood. Well, great and she probably thinks some sort of mystical force protects her so she won't give up without a lot of violence, right? Yeah, probably. I'm gonna call the institute to warn them. Alright, hurry up. All these years Jonathan, you ever say anything about this? I told you, it was a long time ago. It's not something I'm proud of. It's not your fault she went over. Just go make your call. Don't even think about... leaving. An 8track? Thank you God. I need your truck! What? Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! getting out of here, man. Who the hell is she? What you doing?
