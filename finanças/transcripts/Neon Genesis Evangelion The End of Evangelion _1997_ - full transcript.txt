Neon Genesis Evangelion The Feature Film Sections 2 and 3 of the East Wing will close at 1800 hours. All staff must vacate the area by 1630. Misato and Ayanami scare me. Help me. Help me, Asuka. Hey, wake up. Hey... wake up! Hey, hey... Asuka... Asuka... Asuka! Help me. Please help me. Help me. Help me. Help me! Call me an idiot like you always do! Hey! I'm so fucked up. Air Episode All access to and from Headquarters has been restricted? We're on First Level Alert. That doesn't make sense. I thought Kaoru was the last Angel. He was. All the Angels have been defeated. If we're all safe, what are we doing on First Level Alert? What's going to happen to NERV and the Evas? I wish Dr. Akagi was here. NERV will probably be disbanded. I don't know what they're going to do with us. All we can do is wait for the Instrumentality Project to commence. So mankind, a race of flawed and incomplete separate entities, has reached the end of its evolutionary potential. The Instrumentality Project will manufacture the evolution... of man's separate entities into a single consummate being. And the Committee won't use NERV or Adam. They'll use the Evas. Just like Kaji said they would. The time is at hand. Without the Lance of Longinus, we cannot use Lilith to complete the Project. Our only hope is to proceed using Lilith's only true offspring, Eva Unit 01. That was not part of SEELE's original plan. Creating the Evangelion was the pinnacle of mankind's existence. Humanity must evolve and shape this brave new world. That was why we created the Eva Series. We need not cast aside our human form... to use Evangelion as our own private Ark. It's merely part of the process to free us all for rebirth. The fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth. Through the sacrament of death, God, and humanity, all living beings will be united and reborn as one. Death creates nothing. You deserve death. Mankind exists because it has the will to live. That is the will of she who chose to remain in the Eva. So, that's what really happened during Second lmpact. They're on to me! No, wait, something else. It's begun. We are under attack. Transfer the left to the emergency communications systems! Use satellite feed if you have to! Correct. What's the right side status? Negative. All outgoing network lines are being systematically cut off! They're going after the MAGI. Data upload from external terminals. They're trying to hack into the MAGI, sir! Just as I thought. Is it coming from the MAGI 2 in Matsushiro? No, there are 5 MAGI systems working together. So far I've identified the MAGI from Germany, China, and the U.S. SEELE is pooling all its resources. Five MAGI against one. Not good odds. The fourth firewall has been breached! Locking the main database... Negative! The system is being overtaken! They've breached the next level! The backup system is inoperative! This is bad. If they capture the MAGI, they will be able to occupy headquarters. Let me guess. They need help with the MAGI's self-defense system. Yes. Report to the Second Command Center... where you will be briefed by Lt. Ibuki. He expects the woman he abandoned to jump when he calls. Arrogant bastard. A Level 2 Alert is in effect. Status report. Good morning. Tokyo 2 launched Special Order A-801. 801? NERV's legal protection and jurisdiction have been rescinded... and command has been transferred to the Japanese Government. That was the only warning. They tried to take the MAGI, but we've managed to contain the damage so far. Ibuki here. Dr. Akagi is currently installing additional defense programs. Ritsuko?! Am I doing something stupid? The interaction between men and women is so illogical. Isn't that right... Mother? Goura Ground circuit recovery 0.2%. How much longer? We should make it. Dr. Akagi is amazing! Just hacking into the MAGI? Yeah, right. I doubt they're going to let us off that easily. The MAGI was just foreplay. They plan to launch an all-out offensive against Headquarters... and take the two Evas by force, don't they? Of course. We have both Adam and Lilith. No wonder the old men are so nervous. External feed to the MAGI has been halted. A Danang B-Type Defense program is in place. External access has been cut off for the next 62 hours. Mother. I'll see you soon. Ikari has installed a Type 666 firewall on the MAGI's external feed circuits. That's very difficult to breach. Apparently we will have to forgo acquisition of the Tokyo-3 MAGI. I had hoped to settle this peacefully. Launch the invasion forces immediately! All units move out as planned. We have lost the radar feed from sectors 8-17! A large detachment of Special Force Units... has invaded the outer defense perimeter! Two more are approaching from the Gotenba sector! After all we've been through, our final enemy is our fellow man. All personnel go to Level One battle stations. Battle stations?! But they're human, not Angels! I wish they felt the same way. What's happening?! Hey! What's wrong? Transmission from the southern hub has been... The Daigatake tunnel has been cut off! Fire in the West No.5 entrance! Hostile forces have entered Level 1! The west side attack is a decoy! If they're really after the Evas, they'll go after the pilots first. -- Tell Shinji to stand by in Unit 01. -- Roger! -- Where's Asuka? -- Still in recovery room 303. Get her into Unit 02! There's no way she can synchronize with Unit 02! If they find her, they're going to kill her. If we put her in Unit 02, at least she'll be safe. Understood! As soon as Asuka's in there, hide Unit 02 at the bottom of the lake. It's not the best hiding place, but it's better than the cage. -- Where's Rei? -- Unable to locate! Pilot of Unit 00 is missing! She will be killed. Find her, now! Launching Unit 02 via gate number 8. The Eva will remain underwater at a depth of 70 meters. Prepare to deploy Unit 01. Station it in the Geofront. We can't! Shinji isn't there! Oh, dear god... Full lock down has been instigated, starting at Level 2. All non-combat personnel must evacuate via route 87 immediately. I repeat... The No.3 underground barricade has been destroyed! Enemy forces have begun invading Level 2! There's nothing we can do to hold them off. Our defeat has become inevitable. Professor Fuyutsuki, please see to the rest of this for me. Yes, Commander. Give my regards to Yui. No response from Level 2! Contact has been lost with control room 77. Internal monorail track 57 has been destroyed. This is brutal! I'd rather be fighting the Angels! Of course. We're not used to fighting human enemies. Sever the red ones first. Level 3 Block B has been invaded! There's no stopping them! Enemy presence confirmed in Block F! The Main bypass is under fire! Seal off levels 1-3! Order a full retreat! Release Bakelite through all passages up through section 803! Right! Commencing Bakelite release in section 703, thirty seconds to completion. Commencing Bakelite release in section 737... Well, that should buy us some time. Major Katsuragi! Route 47 is completely blocked. The third Unit is unable to advance. Shinji is cut off! All non-combat personnel should avoid engaging the enemy. These guys are pros, so if you can't retreat to Central Dogma... you're better off just surrendering. -- Take charge of things here for me. -- Right. Mt. Futago has been secured. This is harder than we thought. We never get the easy jobs. This is insane! The center wasn't made to withstand invading armies. We can barely hold off terrorists. If the JSSDF launches a full-scale attack, we're screwed. Slowly but surely they've been cutting our defense budget. They've probably been planning this since the very beginning. Very possible... Release the safety. I can't. I just can't shoot this thing. Of course you can! You've had basic training! But I shot at targets, not at other human beings! Idiot! It's kill or be killed! Rei. I knew I'd find you here. The time has come. Let's go. Level 1 has been secured. Over. Roger that. We are moving in on the MAGI and the Level 2 Command Center. We are currently engaged in combat. Commence cooling of the Fifth Malbolgia sector immediately. Terminate Eva Pilots on sight. Execution of non-combat personnel has been authorized. Yanagihara and Shinjo units, proceed to lower level. We've located the Third Child. Commencing termination. Sorry, kid. Nothing personal. Nothing personal here either. Let's get you to Unit 01. Come on. Roger that. We have the purple unit surrounded. The Bakelite infusion was not a problem. Damn. They're trying to prevent contact between Shinji and Unit 01. We're running out of time. This is it, Shinji. Do you want to run away or do you want to pilot the Eva? If you sit there and do nothing, then you're already dead! Help me, Asuka... help me. Hiding behind the skirts of a little girl at a time like this?! Giving up halfway is worse than never trying at all! Get up. Move it! I want to die. I don't want to do anything. Stop talking like a stubborn little brat! Like it or not, you're still alive! Get moving and DO something! You can die later. Unimportant! Securing Terminal Dogma is your top priority, understand?! They've destroyed everything else, why don't they just nuke us and get it over with?! If we weren't sitting on top of the original MAGI system, they probably would have. They probably need it in as intact as they can get it. I just hope they don't use BC weapons. Things could get pretty ugly. That or N2 mines. Speak of the devil... They aren't holding anything back! They're over doing it. Why do they want the Eva this badly?! They plan to initiate Third lmpact... using the Eva series instead of the Angels. 15 years ago, the Second lmpact was intentionally engineered by mankind, because it was the only way to minimize the potential damage. They had to reduce Adam to an embryonic state... before the other Angels awoke. You see, Shinji, mankind was spawned from a being called Lilith, a progenitor of life like Adam. We are the 18th Angel. The other Angels are just different possibilities of... what we could have become. Sadly, we can't coexist... even though we are fundamentally the same creatures. Listen, Shinji. You have to destroy the rest of the Eva Series. It's the only way to stay alive. The phone lines are all dead. Nagano Prefecture, Neo Tokyo 2 Yes, sir. Missile impact was Nagano Prefecture, Neo Tokyo 2 Yes, sir. Missile impact was Prime Minister's Official Residence Executive Office Number 3 confirmed three minutes ago. Prime Minister's Official Residence Executive Office Number 3 This Instrumentality Project Prime Minister's Official Residence Executive Office Number 3 NERV was secretly researching... Prime Minister's Official Residence Executive Office Number 3 NERV was secretly researching... trying to initiate Third lmpact and destroy all of mankind. The whole thing makes me sick. Humanity is probably the only creature... capable of hating its own kind. Well, then. I suppose all we have left to do... is destroy NERV Headquarters. Should Germany or China begin re-development? No. We won't make the same mistake twice. Make sure no one can touch it for the next 20 years, like Old Tokyo. Surface heat has dissipated. High pressure steam discharges have also stopped. All detachments' positions have been confirmed. Dogma Level 3 and the purple unit are currently secured. And the red one? In the lake, about 70 meters down. We don't know if the pilot is alive or dead. I'm still alive...? I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die yet... -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die yet... -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die yet... -- I don't want to die. -- You must live... -- I don't want to die. -- You must live... -- I don't want to die. -- You must live... -- I don't want to die. -- I don't want to die. -- I won't let you die... -- I don't want to die. -- I won't let you die... -- I don't want to die. -- I won't let you die... -- I don't want to die. -- I will protect you... -- I don't want to die. -- I will protect you... -- I don't want to die. -- I will protect you... -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- You're still alive... -- I don't want to die. -- I won't let you die... -- I don't want to die. -- I won't let you die... -- I don't want to die. -- I won't let you die... -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die... -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die... -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die... -- You mustn't die... -- I don't want to die. -- You mustn't die... -- I don't want to die. -- Please die with me! -- I don't want to die. -- Please die with me! -- I don't want to die. -- Please die with me! -- I don't want to die. -- Don't kill her... -- I don't want to die. -- Don't kill her... -- I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. -- I don't want to die. -- You must live... -- I don't want to die. -- You must live... -- I don't want to die. -- You must live... -- I don't want to die. I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!! Mama! You've been here all along? Mama!! -- What is that?! -- Dear God! Mamma... Mamma! Now I understand! The meaning of the AT Field! You were always protecting me! Always watching over me! We were always together! Mamma! Eva Unit 02 has activated! Asuka is okay! She's alive! Asuka?! The cable! Focus your fire power on that cable! Even without my umbilical cable, I've still got 12 thousand plates of fortified armor! And I've got my AT Field! There's no way I can lose! Not to you bastards! That loathsome Evangelion. Once again, our plans will go unrealized. It seems we'll have to fight fire with fire. The Eva Series? It's been completed? They've dispatched all 9 units equipped with S2 engines? That seems a bit much. Unless... do they plan to start it here?! Listen up, Asuka. I want you to destroy the rest of the Eva series. Shinji will be there as soon as he can. Hang in there. So, we can get to Unit 01 through Access route 20, right? Affirmative. We placed triple protection on the power supply. So long as you get there in the next three minutes, it'll take you directly to Cage 7. "Destroy the rest of the Eva Series," huh? Is that any way to talk to someone fresh out of the hospital? Nine units in only three and a half minutes... so that's 20 seconds each. Erste! This is it. They got away. Target has not been terminated. Should we pursue them? Negative. That area has been targeted for demolition. Pull back immediately. Roger. Well, that should hold them off for a while. Don't worry. It's not as bad as it looks. The power is still on. There's still time. Shinji, listen to me. From now on, you're on your own. You'll have to make your own decisions. I... I can't. I'm no good. I can't pilot Eva if all I do is hurt and kill people. I thought I had no choice but to pilot Eva, but I was just lying to myself. I'm not worthy of piloting an Eva because I don't understand anything! I'm incapable of doing anything good for anyone else. I did something terrible to Asuka. I killed Kaworu. I'm a horrible person. I'm dishonest and a coward. All I ever do is hurt other people, so I'd rather do nothing at all! I'm not going to feel sorry for you. If you don't like feeling pain, then you can just sit here and die. Crying isn't going to solve anything, either! You hate yourself, don't you? That's why you hurt others. Deep down you know that you suffer more... when you cause someone else pain, than if you just let yourself get hurt. But, Shinji, that was YOUR decision, so that makes it a valid choice. That was what you wanted, so that makes it worthwhile. Stop lying to yourself, and realize that you DO have options. Then accept the choices you've made. But you're not me. You don't understand! So what if I'm not you?! That doesn't mean it's okay for you to give up! If you do, I'll NEVER forgive you as long as I live. I'm not perfect either. I've made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I've done it over and over again. A cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred. But even so, every time I learned something about myself. Please, Shinji. You've got to pilot Eva and settle this once and for all. Find out why you came here. Why you exist at all. And when you've found your answers, come back to me. Promise me. See you soon. That was a grown-up kiss. We'll do the rest when you get back. If I had known it would end like this, I would have changed the carpet like Asuka suggested. Right, Pen Pen? Kaji... I did the right thing, didn't I? Damn, they're persistent. Of course that idiot Shinji is nowhere to be found! I've been waiting for you. I'm sorry... but I changed the MAGI's programming without telling you. A loving daughter's final request. Mother, let's end it together. It's not working Why?! DENIED Casper betrayed me?! Mother, how could you chose your lover instead of me? Ritsuko Akagi. I truly... Liar. What's happening up there? Less than a minute left in her power reserves. At this rate, Asuka will... I cannot be defeated!! Mama is watching after me! Mama? Mother! This is the last one! The Spear of Longinus? Internal power supply depleted. Operational limit has been reached. Unit 02 has gone silent. What the... The defeated Eva Series... The Eva Series units have reactivated! Are they going to finish her off? What's happening?! I don't want to see this! I can't watch! Is that Unit 02? I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Berserker! Stop it. Asuka! Stop!! I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Shinji! Unit 02! Asuka is... Asuka!! I can't get to Eva. There's nothing I can do. Mother. Unit 01 has finally awoken. Evangelion Unit 01! The devil himself. Asuka... To Be Continued Thank you very much. Hideaki Anno I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to the cast, staff, friends, and the five women who helped bring this picture to its completion. I have already joined with Adam. The only way I will ever see my Yui again, is through the forbidden fusion of Adam and Lilith. We're running out of time. Your AT Field won't hold it's shape for much longer. Let us begin, Rei. Release your AT Field, the barrier of your mind. Make our imperfect souls whole again. Discard this unnecessary physical shape. Merge all souls into one. And then, take me to Yui's side. Episode 26 Sincerely, yours Asuka. Ikari. There's an object approaching at tremendous speed from Lunar space. What the hell?! It's not... It's the Spear of Longinus! At long last, our dreams will be realized. The original Spear of Longinus has been returned to us. We have fewer Units than we planned, but we'll have to make do. Bring forth the true form of the Eva series. The true form will evangelize humanity. Through indiscriminate death and through prayer, we will return to our original state. And our souls will be at peace. Let the sacrament begin. Eva Unit 01 has been captured! Ascending to 12,000 meters! And still rising. Those bastards! Does SEELE plan to use Unit 01 as a medium? Eva Unit 01 has been marked with the Holy Stigmata. Let us restore the Tree of Life! The Eva series have been our faithful servants... and this is the reason they were created. The Eva Series has unleashed their S2 engines! Dimensional values are inverting. Numerical expression and measurement is impossible! It's an Anti-AT Field. It's the same as what happened 15 years ago. Has Third lmpact actually begun? The S2 engines have reached critical limit. We're unable to maintain gravitational control. Our mission is a failure. Direct hit! Surface ground layers are melting! The second wave is eroding the headquarters periphery! The outer hull has been exposed! These are only physical shock waves! Set absorbers on maximum. It should hold. Here to represent eternity... The Red Earth Purification Ceremony. First the Geofront is returned to... its original form. The Egg of Lilith, source of all human life. The Black Moon. We no longer wish to return inside her shell. But that is for Lilith to decide. It appears to have begun. Now, Rei, it's time to reunite me with Yui once more. What?! I am not a puppet. But why? Because I am not you. Rei! Please, Wait! Rei! I can't. Ikari is calling me. Rei! I'm home. "Welcome home." Rei. An unidentified high energy object from Terminal Dogma... is approaching rapidly! AT Field confirmed! Pattern Blue! Not an Angel? Negative! It's a... a human! No! NO! Dammit... ...Dammit...... ...Dammit......! Ayanami?! Rei... Through the destruction of the ego of Eva Unit 01's pilot, humanity shall now be completed. The Third Retribution is at hand. The AT Fields of the Eva Series are all resonating! Resonation is increasing! Have they begun merging with Rei? Psychograph signal down! Destrado has begun to manifest! The pilot's ego won't be able to take much more of this. No more. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. Is this better? Have you been there the whole time, Kaworu? The solenoid graph is inverting! His ego barrier is getting weaker! AT Field is shifting to pattern red! The Fruit of Life is held by the Angels. The Fruit of Wisdom is held by man. Eva Unit 01 now posses them both, and, therefore, becomes God. Now the Source of all souls, the Tree of Life has been formed again. Will it be an Ark to save mankind from the vacuum of Third impact? Or is it the demon that will destroy us all? The fate of mankind now lies in the hands of lkari's son. Tell me, have we done the right thing? How should I know?! This Rei is your heart. She embodies your hopes and your dreams. What is it you wish for? I see. It's just like when I first started playing the cello. I thought if I came here, I would find what I was looking for. Hey, Shinji! C'mon! Let's build a sand castle! Look, Mama's here! We gotta go now! Bye! Mama! Mama! Enough already! Even just the sight of you gets on my nerves! Because I'm just like you? Mama! Mama. Mama. I wasn't able to be a mother to Shinji in the end. Let's do it. Again? I thought you were meeting your friend at school today. Oh yeah, Ritsuko. Don't worry, I've got plenty of time. We've been hanging around here for the past week. Yeah, but I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of it. C'mere. I guess I just do things like that... to prove I exist. That's stupid! It's just two depressed grown-ups licking each other's wounds! It's nice to feel needed, even if it's just physically. It makes me feel wanted, and so it makes me happy. It's just an easy way to convince yourself... that you're worth something. Does Misato really do things like that? Yes, this is also me. The me that exists when two hearts are joined as one. The me that Shinji has never known. Reality can be painful, but it's something that you must learn to accept. When I grow up, does that mean I'll do the same things Misato does? You wanna kiss me? You can't. Why? Are you scared? That stuff's not for kids. Here I come! You don't understand anything. You just stay away from me! I do understand. You couldn't possibly, you big JERK! You really think you can ever know me? You think you can even help me?! I can't believe how arrogant you are! You will NEVER understand!! How can I ever understand you if you won't say anything? You never talk to me, but you expect me to understand you. That's IMPOSSIBLE!! Did you ever really try, lkari? Of course I did. Idiot! I know all about your little jerk off fantasies about me. Go ahead and do it like you always do. I'll even stand here and watch you. If I can't have you all to myself, then I don't want anything from you. Then, try being nice to me. We are nice to you. Liars! You're just hiding behind those smiles, intentionally keeping things ambiguous! Because the truth causes everyone pain... because the truth is very, very traumatic. But ambiguity only causes me more pain. That's just an excuse. But it scares me, because I don't know if everyone will stop wanting me again. I feel awkward and uneasy. Let me hear your voice! Don't leave me! Please care about me! I want to help you, Asuka, and I want to stay with you. Then, don't do anything. Don't come near me. All you ever do is hurt me. Asuka, help me. You're the only one that can help me! Liar. Anyone will do. You don't care who it is! You're afraid of Misato and the First Child! You're afraid of your mother and father, too! So now you come running to me... because that's the easiest way to keep from getting hurt! I need you to help me! You never even loved yourself! You're all you have, and you never even learned to like yourself. Pathetic. Help me. Somebody please help me. Help me. Help me. Somebody help me! Don't leave me alone! Don't abandon me! Please don't kill me! No. Episode One: Angel Attack Episode Two: Unfamiliar Ceiling Episode Three: The Phone That Never Rings Episode Four: Rain, After Running Away Episode Five: Rei, Beyond Her Heart Episode Six: Showdown In Tokyo-3 Episode Seven: Human Creation Episode Eight: Asuka Strikes Episode Nine: With One Accord In A Flash Episode Ten: Magma Diver Episode Ten: Magma Diver Episode Eleven: In The Still Darkness Episode Twelve: The Value Of A Miracle Is Episode Thirteen: Angel Invasion Episode Fourteen: SEELE, Throne of Souls Episode Fifteen: Lies And Silence Episode Sixteen: Sickness Unto Death, And...

You never understood anything. I thought this was supposed to be a world without pain, and without uncertainty. That's because you thought that everyone else felt the same as you do. You betrayed me! You betrayed my feelings! You misunderstood from the very beginning. You just believed what you wanted to believe. Nobody wants me, so they can all just die. Then what is your hand for? Nobody cares whether or not I exist. Nothing ever changes, so they can all just die! Then tell me, what is your heart for? It would be better if I never existed. I should just die, too. Then why are you here? Is it okay for me to be here? (Silence) Pilot response approaching infinite zero! Eva Series and Geofront are approaching the E layer... and still rising! Current altitude is 220,000 kilometers. Now Entering F layer. All Eva units are operational! The Anti-AT Field from Lilith is expanding and materializing! Anti-AT Field has exceeded critical limits! If this continues, individual entities will be unable to maintain their separate forms! The Chamber of Guf is open. The door to both the beginning and the end of the world... is open at last. This world is overflowing with sorrow. Its people are drowning in emptiness. Loneliness fills their hearts. Ikari, did you also finally get to see Yui again? The AT Fields. The AT Fields are all disappearing. Is this the answer? Is this what I was looking for? Ritsuko? Maya. Ritsuko. Ritsuko. Ritsuko. Ritsuko!! The beginning and the end are one and the same. Yes, all is right with the world. I've waited so long for this moment to arrive. I will finally be with you again, Yui. When Shinji is near me, all I ever do is cause him pain. It was better when I did nothing at all. Were you afraid of Shinji? I didn't believe that anyone could love me. I don't deserve to be loved. So you were running away. You rejected the others so that you would never be hurt. You were terrified by the invisible bonds that people form. You were afraid, and so you closed your heart. This is my retribution. Forgive me, Shinji. Rei Ayanami. I hate you. Don't call me anymore. You bother me. God, you're persistent. Goodbye! I wish you'd leave. I have no interest in getting back together with you. Let's just be friends. Do I even know you? Look at you! You really get on my nerves. Who the hell are you? I couldn't care less whether you live or die. I don't love you "that way". I don't want you in my life. To be honest, you get on my nerves. Stop following me around. I can't do this any more. Let's break up. I don't need you anymore. Who would want to go out with you? I don't need you, I never did. Go away. You wimp. If it's too painful, you can always make it stop. If you don't like it, you can just run away. Do you want to be at ease? Do you want to feel peace of mind? Do you want to become one with me? To have our bodies and souls join as one? I'd rather die than do it with you! Hey... What is it? What are dreams? Dreams? Yes, dreams. "Does it feel good?" I don't understand. I don't understand what reality is. You can't bridge the gap between your own truth... and the reality of others. I don't know where to find happiness. So you only find happiness in your dreams. Then this is not reality, this world where no one exists. No, it's only a dream. Then I don't exist here either. This convenient fabrication is your attempt to change reality. Is that wrong? You were using fantasy to escape reality. Why can't I dream that I'm alone? That is not a dream. That's a substitute for reality. So, where is my dream? It is a continuation of reality. But where is my reality? It is at the end of your dream. Ayanami. Where are we? This place is a sea of LCL. The primordial soup of life. A place with no AT Fields, where individual forms do not exist. An ambiguous world... where you cannot tell where you end and others begin. A world where you exist everywhere... and yet you're nowhere, all at once. Is this death? Not quite. This is a world where we are all one. This is the world you wished for. But this isn't right. This feels wrong. If you wish for others to exist, the walls of their hearts will separate them again. They will all feel fear once more. Okay then. Thank you. I only felt pain when I existed in that reality. So I thought it was alright to run away. But there was nothing good in the place I escaped to either. Because I didn't exist there, and so no one existed. Is it alright for the AT Field to cause you and others pain again? I don't mind. But what are the two of you within my heart? We are the hope... that people will one day be able to understand each other. And we are the words, "I love you. ' But that's just a pretense. A selfish belief. Like some kind of prayer. It can't possibly last forever. Eventually, I'll be betrayed, and it will abandon me. But still, I want to see them again, because at the time, I know my feelings were real. Reality exists in a place unknown, and dreams exist within reality. And truth lies in your heart. The contents of a person's heart shapes their appearance. And new images will change their hearts and their forms. The power of imagination is the ability to create your own future, and the power to create your own flow of time. But if people don't act of their own free will, then nothing will change at all. So, you must regain your own lost form by your own volition. Even if it means your words become lost... or confused with the words of others. Anyone can return to human form... as long as they are able to imagine themselves within their own heart. Don't worry. All living creatures have the power to be brought back to life... and the will to go on living. Anywhere can be paradise, as long as you have the will to live. After all, you are alive, so you will always have the chance to be happy. As long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth exist, everything will be alright. Will you be alright? I still don't know where my happiness lies. I'll still think about why I'm here, and whether or not it was good to come back. But that's just stating the obvious over and over. I am myself. But, Mother... What will you do, Mother? When man created Evangelion, were we trying to create a clone of God? Yes. Humans can only exist on this earth, but the Evangelion can live forever... along with the human soul that dwells within. Even 5 billion years from now, when the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are gone, Eva will exist. It will be lonely, but as long as one person still lives. It will be eternal proof that mankind ever existed. Goodbye, Mother. How disgusting. The End
