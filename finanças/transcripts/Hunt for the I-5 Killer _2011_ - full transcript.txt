Can I help you? Oh, my god. Please don't hurt me. He asked for the money, and then he didn't even wait. He grabbed my shirt and the gun went off... Can you describe him? Yes... no, it's hard. This really hurts. I know. He had a bandage thing across his nose... you mean a band-aid? Yeah, and a jacket hood over his head, so I don't know. Dark hair? Kinda tall. Big. Not fat. Just big. I wish you didn't have to go. I wish you'd come up and stay with me in spokane again. There's no jobs up there. You could get a job here. Not that pays $22 an hour. You wouldn't have to work. I want to work. I love to work. Scrubbing bathrooms? It's not just that. If you knew how much I miss you... Beth, gotta go. What are you going to do when you get up there? I'm going to miss you. Aw... That's so nice! Call me when you get there. I will. Thanks for stealing my girlfriend, shari. Thanks for making US late for work, Eddie. You're welcome. I love you. Shh! I thought I heard a noise. This place creeps me out. I'm glad it's not one of our regulars. All I want to know is, do we have to clean all those windows? Taking the trash out. Oh, hold on a sec, I'll help you. There's not that much. And then we're done. Ooh... Oh, crap, shari. We forgot to clean the door. Damn. Let's do it, then. Shari? What was that? Shari? Move it. You're... you're robbing US? Hey, we don't actually work... shut up! Get in that room. Okay... Hey, I've only got eight dollars, I'm sorry. Take off your clothes. I said now! All of it! Okay. 9-1-1. what is your emergency? We've been... shot... Shari's hurt real bad. Please... please help US. Can you tell me where you are? T-title company, commercial road. Please hurry, before he comes back... Shari... Shari, shari... Come on, talk to me. Shari... Shari, talk to me! Shari... Shari... Just got a call... gunshot victims down on commercial road... had to say it, didn't you? Had to say Salem was too sleepy for you. No, I said it'd be nice to work on a case that was more of a challenge. Ah, the army has ruined you, kominek. Too many bullets whizzing past your ears has made you into an adrenaline junkie. If she's a witness, I'm talking to her... she took two bullets to the head. We gotta get her to the E.R. How is she still conscious? Don't know, but she's in severe shock. Didn't realize she had no clothes on. Raped? I'm pretty sure. Bruises and contusions everywhere. The other girl, how is she? No heartbeat. Hi, Beth. You were at the title company. That's right. I'm detective Dave kominek, Marion county sheriff's department, and I'm going to find the man who hurt you. And... and shari. He hurt shari, too. That's right. I need a description. Do you know, did... Did shari... Did she... is she going to be all right? Shari didn't make it, Beth. She died about an hour ago. Mm-mm. I told her. I told her to stop crying, 'cause it was making him mad... But she couldn't stop, because of the things he was making US do. I need you to give me a description. Can you do that, Beth? We were finished. Why did I make US go back and get that door that we missed? I... I'm supposed to be dead too. Why aren't I dead too? Well, I'm glad that you're not, because you're here, and you can help me find the man that did this. Just tell me what he looked like. He'll come back for me. No, he won't. He's gonna come back and try to kill me again. Just like shari... oh, my god, shari. Hey... Shari... You need to sit still. You don't want to break open those stitches. You need to go. You're right. I'm supposed to be dead, too. I'm gonna put a guard outside your door. You'll be safe while you're here, okay, Beth? I'll be back tomorrow. ...new York. Albany. Georgia? Atlanta. California. Sacramento. Alabama... Hi, sweetie. You hungry? Nah. Florida. Miami. No, stupid, it's Tallahassee. Hey, Eric, he's not stupid. Don't call your brother stupid, you got that? Yeah, sorry. Okay. I had a long night. I didn't mean to snap. I'm sorry, too. Hey... You want to talk about it? No. You always say that. David? I gotta take a nap, gotta go back to work. I don't even look like me. I think you look pretty good, you know, considering. Little kids will see me and run screaming. You should let me call Eddie. No. D-Don't you dare call Eddie. I... I don't want him to know what happened. He's gonna see the scars. That's not what I'm talking about. You should talk to that rape counselor who came in here... Hi, Beth. I'm Beth's sister. Tammy. Hi, Tammy. I know this probably isn't a good time, but I still need to get a description of the man who shot you and shari. He did worse than shoot me. But you do remember. I don't really know if his hair was curly or... or not, or straight, 'cause of the hood thing, but a little of the dark pieces... Dark and... and straight. And then, uh... A little bit of beard, stubble. ...the suspect is described as a white male, in his 30s, six feet tall, facial hair, wearing a hooded brown jacket and black gloves. Anyone with information about the suspect or the shooting is asked to contact detective Dave kominek at the Marion county sheriff's department. They didn't say nothing about the band-aid on the guy's nose. Is that some kind of big deal? It was on the sketch. Not everybody's gonna be looking at the sketch, so yeah, it's kind of a big deal that we put out an accurate description of the suspect. Unless we don't really want to catch him. I need a list of those sex convictions from the state attorney's office. Make it happen. How was work today? Oh, you know, horrible. Yeah? Your boss is still being a jerk, huh? Yeah. What are you and shari doing tonight? Um, what? You and shari cleaning tonight? Um... no. We're not working, we're going to the movies. Ah. Remember last time you and I went to the movies? I gave you a rash from all that making out we did. Next time, shave first. You sound a little funny. Your ex-boyfriend been calling you again? 'Cause I'll go down to u-dub, I'll talk to him... what? No, I'm good. I just... I have to go now. Sure you're okay? I just... Miss you so much, and I... I... I have to go. Bye. There you are. They signed me out, like, an hour ago... oh. I thought you were my sister. I'm here to ask for your help once again. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Well, forensics didn't turn up anything at the scene. I need you to come back to the title company with me... I'm not going back there, forget it. I know it's not going to be easy, but maybe it'll jog your memory... I don't want to remember it. I don't want it to have happened at all. But it did happen. Beth, it happened, and I don't want it to happen to anyone else. Do you? Is there any detail you can remember? Did he take anything out of his jacket? You know, something about his body, a mole or a scar? I don't remember anything else. I was scared out of my mind. Did he say anything about himself? Talk about a job? Talk about a brother or mother...? How about his voice? Did he have an accent? Did he use an odd phrase? Look at me! I don't know why we did what he told US to do, okay? I don't know why I didn't just jump on him and scratch his eyes out, I don't know why... Beth, there's nothing you could have done that would have changed anything that happened. I know you're trying to help, but I wish you wouldn't lie to me. He did say that he saw US through the window when he was driving by. Black gloves... Masking tape... .32 caliber... Last month, Eugene, Oregon, the 13th. White male, adhesive tape over his nose robs an ice cream shop one block off the i-5. Next night, convenience store, Albany. White male, little bit of facial hair, takes the 16-year-old clerk in the back, sexually assaulted her. 21st, Seattle, Washington, a fast-food joint, half a block from the i-5, April soames, 21, shot in the back, .32 caliber. Raped. She died. Last month, roseburg, Oregon, Lydia hall, just turned 18, shot by a man with a band-aid over his nose. .32 caliber bullet. She lived. Then a week later, here in Salem, the title company. Beth Williams and shari hull, raped, shot in the head by a man with a band-aid across his nose. Beth lived. Shari died. Eight robberies, seven assaults, rapes, murder, two states, all off the i-5, a block or two off an i-5 exit. We got a serial killer working the i-5 corridor. I want you to just run in, no standing and chatting with Darryl if he's there. Excuse me, are you lost? Please, don't hurt her. Mom... Stop your crying. It's going to be okay. When we first called you to this meeting, we were just starting to connect crimes in your various jurisdictions, what looked to be the same man hitting small businesses off of i-5 in Oregon and Washington. Then Tuesday, I got a call from Charlie down in shasta city, California. Charlie? Monday night, my buddy Mike, a fireman, responded to a call at his own house. Two blocks off the i-5. Mike's wife, Millie, 13-year-old daughter, Jenny, they were shot and killed in the bedroom. Jenny had been raped. And ballistics came back to match to the .32 caliber gun that killed shari hull here in Salem two weeks ago, so there's no longer any doubt about it. We've got US another Ted Bundy on our hands. Holy mother... And he's working an 800-mile range? At least. FBI has a profile out, but I think we're looking for a truck driver. Or some kind of traveling salesman. We're also cross-checking all class a and b driver's licenses with convicted sex offenders. That'll take a while. It will, but if we pool our information, I think we can get a bead on this guy, take him down in a day or two. You're all investigating him. Tell me something I don't already know. A car. A fingerprint, tattoo. Your witnesses had to notice something else about him. Nothing. Well... We've got to warn the public. We believe that the assailant's responsible for 15 attacks on women over the last two months. His motive is initially robbery, in most cases rape, and in five cases, he's murdered or attempted to murder his victims by gunshot. 15 attacks? Why are we just hearing about this guy now? Well, we've only been aware of the connection between the cases for less than a week now... a week? Don't you think people should have been told the very first day? Shari... Talk to me! You still sleeping in your clothes? I thought you were going to try and stay another day. I did try. My boss says if I'm not at work tonight, then I should find another job. I don't know why you won't come home with me. Because I don't want anyone to know. It's... it's not your fault, Beth! You don't have to keep it a deep dark secret. I'm not going to tell anyone, okay? They... they'd look at me, and they'd imagine it, and I just, I feel him stuck all over me. I was only trying to help. If you want to help, you can drop me somewhere on your way out of town. The state police jet will take you down to shasta city, and the FBI called. They want in on this case real bad. Hey, everybody and their brother wants in on this damn case. Yeah, well, they're sending an agent down to see you. What for? The FBI's profile was so generic it didn't give US anything to work with. I don't need them wasting my time, bill. My sister was leaving, and I didn't want to be alone, and I... Can't think of anywhere else where I'd feel safe. Is there somebody besides your sister you could stay with? I guess I could call my boyfriend. You have a boyfriend here in town? No, he lives in Washington. He didn't want me to move here. He was right. Dumb idea, huh? I haven't told him yet. Eddie. I talk to him like everything's normal, and when I'm on the phone with him, I almost do feel normal, you know? I do know. But I'm going have to tell him eventually because... He keeps asking about shari. Mm-hm. Maybe you could tell him for me? Everything that happened. Oh, I'm sorry. No, that was a... Weird thing to ask, wasn't it? But then you know I'm not normal. You're fine. You... you're still you, even after the hell that you've been through... and I know that this bastard put you through hell... you're doing better than you know. You are, and I have a number of a friend of mine, a counselor. Her name's Susan. She can help you figure out how to tell people... what, that after I was raped, I had to watch my best friend get shot in the head? Really? Susan can help me work that into a conversation? You just worked it into a conversation with me. You're the only one. The only person in the whole world I can talk to. They were both found there on the bed. Millie was half hanging off... Ah, you saw the pictures. She had to watch her daughter be tied up brutalized. Makes you sick, doesn't it? Could have been my wife and daughter. Although I don't live near i-5. I do. What kind of trace evidence have you come up with? Black fibers, probably from the driving gloves we know he wears. Some rayon fibers too, but don't know what that's from yet. His jacket? Inside lining has rayon. Yeah, well, every other jacket on the planet has rayon in the lining. Hey, your forensics guys, they didn't move the bed. I see the line in the dust. I wouldn't call 'em "my guys." We borrowed 'em from Redding. You know, the bureau would be glad to provide a forensics team to you at any time. We do things a little differently. Hey, look at this. What? That... Is a footprint. The top half of a... A hiking boot. A stray puff of air will blow that away if it's not stabilized. There, stabilized. That's Mike. I don't know how he's ever going to get over this. Did your Redding guys find any tire impressions in the driveway? Sure, but all of 'em match the family cars. Besides, the i-5 killer never parks where he hits. Well, he has to park somewhere. I'm going to call monty holloway, get him to put together a list of all the parking lots with security cameras by i-5 on-ramps that are close to the crime scenes. We'll start where he did. Roseburg. I thought you were off your rocker when you came up with this idea. You're not the first one to tell me that, Jim, but thanks for coming down. What do you got here, a strip mall parking lot on the other side of the freeway? Right, the night Lydia hall was shot. This lot is a quarter-mile away. It's a four-minute walk, tops. Okay, here we go, starting at 10:48 P.M. 20 minutes, timing's about right. I don't know, it seems long to me. Wait a minute. I recognize this guy. Yeah, I saw him outside the gas station. Something about this guy bothered me. He was at the scene? Yeah. Let's see if we can get that license plate... Douglas county sheriff, open up! Gerald toomey, you're under arrest on suspicion of attempted murder. Thanks. Hey. Oh... aw. Oh, you scared me. Oh, Beth, that's my fault. I should have said something. It's just... Look at this, I crushed an orange. It's... Sorry. Please tell me you're not here to ask me to go back to the title company again. No, I think we caught the i-5 killer. We made an arrest in roseburg. A girl was shot a week before you, with a bullet from the same gun. He fits the description of the guy that shot you and shari, and, uh, we're putting a line-up together, and if she can identify him, then I'm going to come back and get you, and you can I.D. Him, too. You think it's really him? He's got a record... domestic violence, aggravated assault. Lives alone in a trailer. No alibi for the nights in question. Even has a pair of hiking boots. I'm pretty sure we got him. Thank god. Please let it be him. Well, you don't have to go down to roseburg. Right. I'm not going to miss this line-up. Monty just called. I-5 killer hit again last night. Yreka, California. When? 11:00 P.M. Gunman hit a donut shop, took the cashier in the back and assaulted her in the bathroom with someone waiting outside to use it. They get a description? White male, six feet, brown jacket with a hood. Black gloves. Silver revolver. Tape over his nose. I won't be taking you down to roseburg. The i-5 killer was in California last night, and the witness down there was unable to identify the suspect. We've ruled him out. You said you had him. I know. I... I was wrong. I'm sorry I got your hopes up. So then he's still out there. Go long! Your landlady's kid, he idolizes you, huh? Then, you're used to that, Mr. Green bay packer. He's a good kid... What's up with you? I thought I was meeting you in Portland tonight. You are. I'm on my way back from California. Really? I don't remember you saying you were going down there. I had some meetings. I travel a lot for my job. Good, good. Maybe that'll take your mind off of Stacy. I know that it hit you hard. Yeah, it hit me hard. My ex-girlfriend got shot in the face, and the cops thought I had something to do with it? I'm sorry. I know that doesn't help a damn thing... no, I'm sorry I got you mixed up in all that. I thought they'd just talk to you about where I was that night. I didn't think they'd sit you under hot lights for three hours. Oh, buddy, that was so messed up that they even suspected you. And that's exactly what I told them, loud and clear. I knew I picked the right guy to be my alibi. But right now, I'd better get back on the road. All right. Beers tonight, though, right? Yeah. Bring that girl you keep telling me about. I'm starting to wonder if she's real. Okay, I'll see what I can do. The same night he killed my friend's wife and daughter in shasta city, he hit a hamburger place a half-hour earlier, sodomized a teenage girl in the ladies' room. Two in one night? Yeah, this guy's out of control. We just found out a couple days before he killed shari hull, he forced his way into a house in corvallis, two little girls, home alone. About eight and ten. He made them take off all their clothes... Well, that's... that's about the same age as my kids. This guy's an animal. Dave's been working with Roy and the Oregon state police on a rapid response plan. When our guy hits again, we want to get roadblocks in place on the i-5. We'll get him on his way back home. Look, i... I don't know. Roadblocks take a lot of manpower. You know how many exits there are on this highway? 134. Yeah, okay, there you go. I mean, that's a lot of holes for him to slip through. I just... I don't know if it's worth it. You don't want to invest the manpower? You want to tell that the families of the victims? Huh? I will put a roadblock up and down this whole state at every exit. This sick son of a bitch isn't going to hurt one more girl, not one more. Oh, hello. Beth. What a... what a surprise. Stacy dumped you what, three months before she was killed? Four. Okay, but that's enough time to get over her. I'm never gonna get over her. I loved Stacy. But she... she hurt you. You don't get it. Hi. I'm Samantha. I'm taking over Carla's tables. Can I get you guys another round? Yes, ma'am, you sure can. Okay, looks like a greyhound for you, and for you? Oh, hey, I remember you. The bartender. Yeah, that's right. I remember you can do a handstand for 36 seconds. I timed you. Yeah. So, see any good movies lately? Uh, not really. What is this? Another one of your football groupies? Or... or did she see you in playgirl and get all hot and bothered? You were in playgirl ? Like, naked? It was just this thing they did on football players. All the... important stuff's covered up. What, come on, you don't have it folded up in your wallet so you can whip it out and show her? You know what, ignore him, okay? And we don't need another round. He's had enough to drink already. All right, well, just let me know if you change your mind. Okay. What'd you say that for? I asked her for a drink, she damn well better bring me a drink. Clay, come on, leave her alone. How 'about that drink, hmm? Who's there? Beth? Hey. Hey, it's me. Can you let me in? Hey... what are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. I thought I'd get here earlier, but... Come here. Sorry. Oh, my god, I... Beth, you're shaking. No, I'm not. What happened to your face? Let me see... don't! Beth... Did you get hurt? Hey... What happened? Please still want me after I tell you. Please still want me... Hey, hey, shh, shh... Thank you for letting me in. My daughter's never late coming home, and her car is still in the parking lot, so she must still be here. Thanks. Samantha! Sweetie? Sam! Sam! Sam? Where are you? Sam! Oh, god, Sam! No... Sam. Sam? Sam? Sam? No... Oh, god, help! Somebody! I'm sorry. I know I wasn't very... Romantic. I feel so bad you drove all this way. I don't care about that. Look, I can't believe you didn't tell me before. I would have come down. You know I love you, right? You know I want to help you? I know, I just can't... You just can't what? I don't know. I can't be... right. I... I can't be close. I need... What do you need? You know, you just name it, I'll do anything for you. You know, I think it's weird you're hanging out at the sheriff's department. Why don't you come stay with me? I'll take care of you. Okay, I will. Except I don't want to. But I'll come. I... Well, which is it? I don't know. I'll call you. Hey. So, um, where's Dave? I think he's talking to the lieutenant. Is there something I can help you with? I'll make him a fresh pot of coffee, then. Beth, my new boss. So Beth's here again. And she's making you coffee. Does she know you're married? Some more? Uh, listen, it was really, really nice of you to have me over. Well, I'm glad to finally meet you. Dave talks about you quite a bit. He does? Mom! He's taking the last leg! Hey, relax, buddy, come on. Everything's okay. Chad, there are more drumsticks on the stove. Apologize to our guest, pal. No, it... it's okay. I have a nephew. I'm used to it. So... What happened to your eyebrow? It's all wrinkly. Hey! It's okay, he can ask. It got broken. A bullet, it went whoosh. What, you got shot? Yup, and now my eyebrow doesn't move. It just sits there like a bump on a log. See? Hmm, I'm a total freak, right? Yeah. Not as much of a freak as Chad, right? Show her... - uh, no... - do the thing... Oh... Oh, that's David, when we broke ground on this house. He built this house himself. You're kidding. It took almost a year. But when David starts something, he doesn't quit until he finishes. Oh, and that's me with Chad, his first birthday. Your family, it's so amazing. You're so lucky. You're right. I am. Me and Eddie, we talk about getting married and having kids, but... I, uh... I don't know if he's the one, so... ...okay, well, I'll see you in a couple days... Randy, come on, man! Let's go! I love you too. Bye. Hey, come on, man... what, you've got to check in with your girl every five minutes? I thought we were going to party. Well, you're in a better mood than you were last night. Yeah, I got that Stacy stuff out of my system. Well, good for you. How'd you do that? So your girlfriend stood you up? No, she's... she's flying down on Tuesday, after she takes this big test, or... something. But when she gets here, I think I'm going to ask her to marry me. You better not, not until I meet her. You've got to bring her by so I can check her out. I don't think so. I mean, I don't know which Clay is going to show up. Hey, look, I'm sorry I acted like a dick last night. It's okay, man. I just want to keep her to myself for a bit. Hey, you should call your old college roommate, rossi, have him meet US. What, you, me, and Tim rossi? That sounds like a party. Hey. Let me get that for you. Thanks. I hate pumping gas. That's what boyfriends are for. Your boyfriend's slacking. Don't have one at the moment. I don't have a girlfriend neither. I did, but you know how that goes. Yeah. Relationships suck. Yeah, so we shouldn't have a relationship, then. We should just leave it to a one-night stand. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. Although I would like to buy you a drink. You can decide on the one-night stand thing later. Thanks, but I'm supposed to be meeting my girlfriend. Great, I can call my friend Randy, and we could make it a party, you know? Um, I don't think so. She hates it when I set her up, and... I don't think it's a good idea. What, do I seem like some kind of creep to you? I don't think that. I'm over here pumping your gas, and you can't have a drink with me? Oh, oh, what now? What, you can't talk to me either? You know what? I'm not surprised you don't have a boyfriend, you bitch! Bye. See you later. Sorry, hon, but we're closed. That door should have been locked. Trisha, you forgot to lock the door again. And me standing here with the money in my damn hand. Go on, take it, you want it so bad. Get in the back room. Both of you, come on. Move! The way you look at me... Like you're the most beautiful girl in the world? Like I'm in love with you? The things you say.... I've never met anyone like you. It's like you're not afraid of anything. Not afraid of love. You sure you don't want any wine? I don't want to lose control, and there's something I've... something important I have to do. Tell me. Well... I know we haven't been together that long, but I have never felt this way before. Angie, you know the real me, and you accept the real me. Um... Angie, will you marry me? Yes. Yes... Oh, my god. I was gonna lose it if you didn't say yes. Oh, my god. Business owners along the i-5 corridor report a drop in business as the i-5 killer and his two-month crime spree continue to escalate. Police say he's responsible for at least four murders, 18 rapes and sexual assaults... can I speak to the manager? And more than 25 robberies. You're speaking to him. Detective mettner, beaverton p.D. I'm investigating the murder of a young woman named Samantha Adams. How can I help you? I'm looking into Samantha's known acquaintances. Her mother said that she used to go out with a bartender that worked here. 30s, dark hair, former football player? Yeah, you mean Randy. What's his full name? Randall woodfield. Big-time jackass. He stole $200 from the till his last night working here, not that I could prove it. I had a couple of waitresses complain about him, too. Complain about what? Oh, you know, they didn't like the way he looked at them. One of them said he had dead eyes, something weird like that. Tell me more about Mr. Woodfield. What kind of car does he drive? There's no way I'll be able to stay so far away from you now. I should drop out of college this semester. No, don't do that. Your folks would be so mad. They're not going to like me. They're going to love you. Don't you think your folks will love me? I don't want to talk about them right now. I love you so much, so much. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not married. But we're engaged to be married. No, look... I said stop it... I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I just... I just want this to be right. I'm sorry. But it feels right to me. Don't you want me? Of course I do, of course I do. It's just that you're my chance to start over, to do things right in the eyes of god, to be a good man. I just want to do this right. Okay... But I think you might be too good for me. Do you want a cup of coffee? You said you'd catch him. I will. It... You have to be patient. It takes time... you said you'd catch him! You said you'd catch him... You're never gonna catch him! You're never gonna catch him! Oh, my god, I'm so tired of being scared! I'm so tired. I'm going to get the man that hurt you and put him behind bars. I don't believe you. I see his face everywhere I go! Oh, god, I... Even at home, I can't... I can't turn on the TV, I can't read anything without seeing his face looking at me. The same face that was looking at me when he held me down, his hand around my neck. I can still feel the... glove... around my neck, I can still feel the pain of him forcing me... Hey, hey, I'm sorry... I'm sorry that he hurt you. Eddie's on his way down to get me. He lives far away from i-5, so I'm going to go stay with him. That's a good idea... Beth, I meant what I said. I'm not giving up till I get this guy and I prosecute him. Maybe you will, or maybe he's too smart to get caught. Maybe he'll just keep doing whatever he wants, and no one can stop him, hmm? Randy, you okay? Yeah. I guess I'm just hungry. I thought you were sad because you don't want me to go. Well, I don't want you to go. I feel better when you're around. I do have to get to the airport, though. All right, well, give the kids a kiss goodnight for me. Give yourself one, too. No, I had a burger, I'm fine. Hey, honey? Happy anniversary. I love you too. Okay, 'night. Go, go! Oh, my god, he's got a gun. It's the i-5 killer. No! No... You're not going anywhere. Stop! Let me go! No! No... Bitch. I-5 killer! I-5 killer! Have you got that roadblock up yet? They want to get another mile north first... no, no, tell them to stop and put it up right now. Two girls were just shot! Put the roadblock up right now. We'll get a second team further south down the road. Roger that. Bitches... Every person, every car! Take a good look. You monitor this line, I got this one. Got it. All by yourself tonight? Okay, she's good. Go ahead. Hi. You guys having a party down here? If I'd known, I would have brought some beer. Mind telling me where you're coming from tonight, sir? Yeah, I was just at my girlfriend's house, down there on horse basin road. But we got into a fight, so I didn't get any, if you know what I mean. What time did you leave there, sir? Hey, stop! Whoa! Whoa! This guy here! All right, go ahead. Let's go, get out of there. Okay, all right, all right. Where do you think you're going, huh? Where do you think you're going, huh? To the hospital! My wife's in labor! I got to get to the hospital! Let US go, please! Oh... Where's that guy? Where's that guy you were just talking to? Well, i... I thought you just had him over here! I didn't mean to wake you. It's okay. I tried calling you earlier. You never told me whether you're taking Eric to that baseball clinic this weekend. I can't take him this weekend. Don't give me a hard time, it's 2:00 in the morning. 2:00 in the morning is the only time I ever see you. Well, it's not like I'm out bowling. Ah, how long are our lives going to revolve around this case? I'd like to know so I can plan. I don't know. Why don't you call him and ask him to end his killing spree so Eric won't miss baseball? Don't you dare act like baseball isn't important, like our kids aren't important... that's not what I said... you know, it is one thing to blow me off on our anniversary. I'm a big girl. I can take it. But to ask those kids to give up the things they love... what do you want, huh? You want me to quit? Is that what you want? Is this about that girl, Beth? No... the one who obviously has a thing for you? Are you working night and day to be her savior, or... will you stop it? Answer the question. Yes, of course it's about Beth. It's about her friend shari, who's dead, it's about the mother and daughter in California who are dead. It's about the two girls who were killed at a diner earlier this evening. My god... This monster is winning, and I am left in his dust, scratching my head like a clueless idiot. You know, I told bill that I wanted a challenge, 'cause I wanted to prove that I could do a good job, and I had a serial killer, and I was gonna drive him into ground. I cannot figure out how this guy thinks. He doesn't act like any serial killer that I've ever heard of, and I'm failing, and every drop of blood that this guy sheds is on my hands now. Honey... Detective mettner. I'm looking for Randall woodfield? Oh. Well, he rents a room from me. Is he home right now? Yeah? Randy, sorry, but there's a police detective here to see you. Okay, I'll be right there. So you admit seeing Samantha Adams? Yeah. Yeah, she waited on me and my friend Clay when we went out for dinner. I didn't even know she worked there, kind of a weird deal. And did you see her later that evening? No, I just went back to my hotel, and I called my fiancee, Angie. You want to see a picture? But you did date Samantha. Well, once. It was kind of embarrassing, actually. She'd told me that she was 22, but when I went over to her house to watch a movie with her, the mother kept giving me the eye, and then she tells me, "guess what, I'm 17." So I got out of there pretty damn quick. That's Angie. I can, uh, get you her number. She'll tell you that I was talking to her on the phone for hours that night. That was the only girl I was thinking of then. Samantha wasn't even on my radar. I'll tell you what's bothering me. You were questioned in the murder of your friend Stacy donner. Now your friend Samantha Adams is dead. That's two women you know who've been killed. Of course, I wasn't the only one who knew them both. My best bud, Clay... Stacy was his ex, and the last time I saw Samantha, well, she was talking to Clay. You're talking about Clay mackey, lives in Portland? Yeah. Man, I... I don't want to think that my best friend could be the one you're looking for. I can't even let my mind go there. If I'm done answering all of your questions, I have a job interview in about half an hour. Would it be all right if I took off? That's fine. Just don't leave town. I might have more questions. I don't seem to have mackey's address. You got that handy? Sure, I'll go grab that. Go, go! Oh, my god, he's got a gun. It's the i-5 killer! No! You're not going anywhere... No! Come on, turn around, turn around. Show me your face. Nothing! I got nothing here! 50 agencies, a thousand men, stakeouts every night of the weeks. Useless stakeouts. Useless tips! Hey, what the hell's going on out here? Nothing. I... lost my cool. Well, go home, grab a nap. Do whatever you have to do to get your cool back. Dave? A detective mettner from beaverton p.D. Is on the phone for you. Yeah, kominek here. I'm working out of the Eugene police department today, had to interview a person of interest in a beaverton murder, lives down here. He doesn't match the m.O. Of the i-5 killer, but he's an ex-con who fits the description. Well, tell me about him, what do you got? Well, the thing that made me call you is... I was at his house, I noticed a couple rolls of adhesive tape sitting on a ledge. Your guy puts tape over his nose... Give me the rundown. Randall woodfield, 30 years old, unmarried, did a couple of years for armed robbery, now he's an unemployed bartender. Rents a room here in Eugene, drives a gold mustang. Gold mustang? Yeah, parked outside the house when I got there. Don't go anywhere. We're going to drive down there right now. Let's go. We're driving to Eugene. Why's that? Might have a real live suspect. Does this look like the guy in the gold mustang? I'm just not sure. The more I think about it, it's possible woodfield's not your guy. He might not even be my guy. He gave me a new window to look into on Samantha Adams. You were looking for him in Portland. Why'd you trace him down here? Woodfield's probation officer. She says he's in violation of his probation for moving down from Portland without permission. Three arrests for indecent exposure in college. No impulse control. Drafted by the green bay packers? The guy's a football player? Arrested for rape, armed robbery. Convicted, served two years... well, there's no way, 'cause we pulled the list of all sex crime convictions. Yeah, I know that list like the back of my hand. His name would have shown up. He was arrested for rape, but the d.A. Dropped the rape charge in his plea bargain. So he wouldn't have been on that list. What's this? Files from another murder case where woodfield's name came up. "Stacy donner. Shot to death..." Donner had broken up with Clay mackey, Randy's best friend. Makes a lot more sense for it to be mackey than woodfield. Mackey doesn't drive a gold mustang. Woodfield does. It says a gun was missing from Stacy donner's apartment after the murders? A silver revolver, .32 caliber? We gotta go get this guy now. I hope you didn't spook him. His car's gone. He's not here. Maybe we can get a search warrant in the meantime. You're back. Randy's a real good tenant. Pays his rent on time. Plays football with my son. Took him to a basketball game once. He doesn't work? No, but he's looking real hard for a job. He's always gone at night. He's a bartender. He says that's the best time to apply. How does he pay you rent without a job? I kind of wonder that sometimes. He gets unemployment, but he buys nice stuff. Steaks for dinner. Sends flowers to his girlfriend. The calls he charges to my phone are hundreds of dollars a month. Well, I'm kind of a phone guy myself, but that's a lot of calls. Do you have a phone bill that we could see? Oh, look at this guy. He makes a call from a pay phone in Salem, Oregon, the night Beth and shari are shot. Shasta city, on the third, the night the mother and daughter are shot. Vancouver, Washington, the night i-5 killer hits three times. Are you kidding me? The same damn night, same damn places? This is him, Mark, we got this guy. Yeah, now we just got to find him. Come on, boys, let's get in that room. Wait, you can't do that. We don't have a warrant. You need to think about this. Anything we find without a warrant can be thrown out in court. That's him. That's the guy from the roadblock. Well... What is this, a surprise party just for me? Randall woodfield? I mean, not that I don't enjoy a party, but you guys weren't really invited. Well, we invited ourselves. I'm Dave kominek, head of the i-5 killer task force. I know. I've seen you on TV. You're a bit of celebrity. Maybe you should think of a career change. You don't seem to be so good with the law enforcement thing. I want to take a look in your room, Randy. Is that all right with you? That's fine. I'd like to take a look at your search warrant. Well, I guess I've got to run downtown and get one. I guess so. I've been looking for you for a long time. I don't take that personally. You know, something bad happens, you cops start flipping through your little list of ex-cons to try and pin it on, but I can tell you right now, I am not the guy you're looking for. You're exactly the guy I'm looking for, Randy. Prove it. Keep your eye on the house till I get the warrant. He leaves, you follow him. I'll send some troopers to back you up. Drive safe. This phone bill places woodfield near six of the i-5 killer's crimes. Six. Well, making phone calls is not a crime. You got anything else to justify a warrant? Judge Scofield's on his last day of vacation, I'm not going to bother him without good reason. Hey, we're talking about a guy that's probably killed eight people, raped and terrorized 20 or 30 more, children, little girls... I got that. You got anything else on him? Anything the i-5 killer is known to wear? The gloves, the jacket? Police records say he's the same blood type. I saw a couple of rolls of adhesive tape at his house, the kind the i-5 killer puts across his nose. Look, I can't call the judge with nothing but a phone bill and some tape. I saw this guy myself within 10 miles of a double murder scene. 10 miles away? That's not even in the same neighborhood. Just let me talk to the judge. Fine, you can talk to him when he's back to work. Look, if you won't help me get a warrant, at least arrest the guy so he can't destroy evidence. Arrest him? On what charge? Parole violation! Chief says that sort of thing is just petty b.S. He likes to go by the book. Now, you said yourself you've got him under surveillance, so he can't go throwing any guns in the river without you knowing about it... you're an idiot. And you are crossing the line. You should go home, and I'll give you a call when the judge is open for business... I'm not going to go home. I've been waiting too long to nail this guy down. I'm not taking my eyes off him. Suit yourself. Screw it. I'm not waiting another day. I'm bringing the guy in right now. Without a warrant. You're jeopardizing your case. I know what I'm doing. Dave, this isn't our jurisdiction. What are you doing? The lieutenant will back US up. He'd better back US up. Besides, you won't get fired, I will. Woodfield! Open the door. Police. Swear to me you didn't take your eyes off this house... I didn't, I didn't. Hey there, you're back. I'm taking you into custody, parole violation. That's all you've got? Sure. All right. Let me just lock up here. All right. Go on, I know you're dying to. As a matter of fact... This reminds me of taking the field with the packers... Everyone watching. You and I both know you got nothing on me. I'll be back here in a day or two, free as a bird. Oh, good, I was hoping it would be you. Why is that, Randy? Because I know you have a thing for me. Just so you know, I save it for the ladies. You like the ladies, huh? The younger the better, am I right? As it happens, they like me. Is that why you got to drag them off at gunpoint and tape their wrists? You still on this kick about me being the i-5 killer? Huh? Come on, man, I was a green bay packer. Yeah, I called them. They said they'd cut you because you couldn't keep your pants zipped up. You liked to show the young girls your thing. That's such crap. Have you seen my fiancee, Angie? When did flashing stop doing it for you? When did causing pain become your thing, Randy? Angie's perfect. You should have a look. You know what, you should ask her what kind of guy I am. Oh, I know what kind of guy you are. You're the kind of guy that can fool your girl into thinking anything you want her to think. You can fool your closest friends, fool everybody about everything, everyone except me, 'cause I can see you. I know there's nothing there. You're not even human anymore, Randy. You called your fiancee from roseburg, right after Lydia hall was shot with a .32 caliber handgun as she was giving you the cash from the cash register. Do you recognize her? You also called her from shasta city, 15 minutes before you broke into the home of Millie loomis. You shot her, then raped her 13-year-old daughter, Jenny, while she was tied up, helpless, then you killed her, too, with the same .32 caliber handgun that you stole from the apartment of Stacey donner after you killed her. You haven't found a gun. We will. A search warrant is being written up right now. Unless you want to tell me where the gun is, Randy? And you called your fiancee from Salem right after you raped these women and shot 'em in the head. This woman, shari hull, she died. This woman, Beth Williams, she lived. Do you recognize her? Look at the picture, woodfield. Screw you. I said look at the picture of the girl that you raped and shot in the head, huh? You don't recognize her now? Where's the gun, you sick, evil son of a bitch? Where's the gun?! Dave! Dave! You ain't gonna find the gun, or any damn thing else on me! The hell I won't. All right, I reached the judge. You wanted a search warrant, you got a search warrant. You put this department in a bad position with a premature arrest, so you'd damn well better find something. Bill is not a happy man. My eardrums are still bleeding. Please tell me we're finding everything we need. We've turned everything over except the wallpaper. There's no gun anywhere. Jacket, gloves? No. What about the tape mettner saw, you didn't find that? There's no tape, Dave. What, he got rid of everything? Everything. I can't get an indictment on a phone bill. He's gonna walk. I didn't want to hang it all on Beth. She's barely keeping her head above water as it is. Eddie, you gonna get it? Hello? Hi. It's Dave kominek. Beth, are you there? I'm here. I found him, the man who hurt you and killed shari. I arrested him today. Are you sure this time? As sure as I can be till you come down here and identify him for me. I can't do that. Beth, I know it's going to be hard... no. I can't see him again. I don't ever want to see him again. Beth, the only way that I can keep him in jail, put him away for life, is if you help me. You're the only eyewitness to murder. I've only just started to sleep again, so you can't ask me to do this. Please don't... I don't want to let him go. It took me this long to find him. I had to fight to bring him in, and I did it all for you. I need you to help me identify him. He's going to walk. They'll let him go. I need you to come down here and help me stop him. Excuse me? Detective kominek? Yes? They told me you were the one who arrested my fiance? That detective. He said you'd been in prison before. I was, but not for the reason they're saying. You know, I had a girlfriend who told lies about me. I told you I stopped trusting women, and that was the reason. But then I met you, and you were so good, and so pure. You gave me back my faith back, baby. But he showed me the phone bill. You called me from the places where the i-5 killer was. No, no, no, they see how innocent you are, too, I just, I hate them for dragging you into this. I just don't understand. That phone bill isn't real. They just whipped it up themselves. Why would they do that? It's an old cop trick. Yeah, I mean, I have a record. I fit the description. So they're going to claim that they have some evidence they don't actually have, try and get me to admit to something I didn't do. I mean, you know me, Angie. You know what's in my heart. You know I would never hurt anyone. Right? I know. I tried to tell the detective that, how wonderful you are. Aw, thank you. He said he's putting you in a line-up tomorrow. That doesn't matter. Yeah, the i-5 killer always wore a band-aid or a piece of tape across his nose. I heard in prison it's impossible to recognize someone who has their nose covered up. I mean, that detective, kominek, he just wants to be famous. You know, but he's going to look like a real idiot when he has to let me go. I'm going to be out of here by tomorrow night, baby. We'll go to Reno, get married. I have to go. You going to come pick me up tomorrow? Bitch. Thanks. You ready? Yeah. Hey. Hey. Oh, man, I've been shaking all day. I can't stop shaking. Well, you came anyway. I'm proud of you. What if it's him, and I can't tell? What if he doesn't look the same as in my nightmares? You'll know if it's him or not when you see him. When you look at evil, you know. You just look at each of the men... And if you see the man who shot you and shari, you write the number on the card. Okay. You kept your promise. You found him. That's him. Are you sure? That's him. You need anything else? I can't believe it's really over. I can't believe I don't have to be afraid anymore. You're a disgusting monster. The most disgusting, worthless person to ever walk the earth. You don't even deserve to breathe. I don't even know you... you're a liar! You killed my best friend! You killed shari! I'm going to make sure that you spend the rest of your life in prison. Do you hear me? You're going to prison, and then you're going to hell. Don't get too comfortable in your cell, Randy. You're going to do another line-up tomorrow for Lydia hall from roseburg. Another one the day after that, another one the day after that... See you in court! You all right? I'm better than I have been in a long, long time. I can't wait to go home and tell Eddie how I just told him off... I got a job up there, you know. At a preschool, helping out with the kids. I bet you're gonna love that. Yeah.... I'm going to be happy. Thank you. Gail? We got him. Randall woodfield is the i-5 killer. He's never going to hurt anybody ever again. Yes, I'm coming home.
