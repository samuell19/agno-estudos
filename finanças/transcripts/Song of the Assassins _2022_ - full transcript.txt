I am Blue Asura Qi Jun-yuan. One of the 4 assassins of the Ghost Valley. I entered the Valley under the recommendation of... My master Commander Gui Chou... to become one of the Valley's 12 generation of assassins. During one of the unrests. I lost my air while protecting the Valley. The overlord of the Valley, Golden Mask... gave me an artitect... The Arm of Asura. Everyone who has joined the Valley... has the same goal. Revenge. When I was young... My father made for a mysterious man... a copper map depicting hidden ancient treasures. My entire clan of 37 relatives were massacred for it. The map has been lost. The search for the map... has led to bloodbaths across the realm. Now. The treasure map has been found. is this some kind of conspiracy? Who is behind it? I have to avenge... my murdered family. It has to be me... who unravel... this plot. East Mulberry My lord... I have investigaded. The copper map pf lost ancient treasures has vanished... is now in the possession of the Governor of Border City. Then why didn't he turn it in? I sent my messengers to him twice... But both times he retused to. If the map were taken by a nostile state. They can retrileve the treasure... and will launch an invasion. Then... Brother. You have no cause for concern. If tou had listened to my advice and struck first. We'd have been the overlord of the realm. Prince Rui. That is not true. Zhao Chuang. Don't forget. I was the one who promoted you... to the rank of General in the Forbidden Army. I'd have thought it was some big deal. My lord. Please don't worry. Governor Gu is a greedy man. I, Zhao Chuang... am willing to travel there on my own... and bribe him with a rarge sum. So that the copper map... can be returned to my lord. General Zhao. If you go there on your own. It'd be a very dangerous mission. For the safety of our country... It is... my obligation to do so. South Pagoda My lord. Lady Fleur has been waiting. It looks really nice. Be careful with the thread. You're always so clumsy. How about this thread? It is good. My lady, how about this? This one will do. Ming, get me a pearl. Is this suiable? Yes. My lady, you've put so much care and effort... into embroidering this royal robe. I've said before... T must craft it with my own hands. The lord is lucky. My lord. I've found out that. The country of East Mulberry will issue a secret decree. Chai Sheng will send Zhao Chuang... to the Governor of their Border City. The trip is to receover the lost treasure map. Zhao Chuang. People call him "the silent wolf". The reticent ones... are often only reiuctant to speak their minds. He was able to win Chai Sheng's trust. shows that he shouldn't be underestimated. Should we.... elimmate him as soon as possible. To elimmate him... one doesn't need to do so in the name of South Pagoda. Don't worry. I will deliver this map... to you without issue. Back in the day, people have forewarned me. Said that you're a scarlet woman. And warned me not to be with you. You're starting to regret it. Ghost Valley Golden Mask I can't imagine Prince Rui... would pay a visit to tramps like us. Golden Mask. I have a favour to ask. Your highness has an army of thousands. You don't need our involvement. What I'm asking your grace... is something I'm not at liberty to do. When the deed is done. I'll make sureto repay you with our assitance. I want you to retrieve... A copper treasure map from my governor. And then... Assassinate the General of may Forbidden Army. Zhao Chuang. God have mercy. I, Zhao Chuang, pray to god. To protect and ensure... the success of this expedition. And to bless my lord... my people... and my country. Commander Gold Mask. The last commandment from the Valley. Let go of hatred and prevail in righteousness. Now Prince Rui asks us for a favour. The Valley can leverage his might... and do some good in these turbulent times. It's not hard to kill Zhao Chuang. But for the copper map... It's been a matter of dispute for years. If your grace doesn't mind my old age. I willing to get to the bottom of this myself. Who we will send... will be announced at the lantern festival tomorrow night. Buts don't involve your pupil in this no matter what. The copper map caused the annihiration of his entire family. I don't want him to complicate things. The map appearing at this time. Mwkes me feer like it's a bad omen. Glass Beach Good. Master. Jun-yuan. I knew you'd be here to watch to play. I bought some smoke for you on the way. Try it. If you like it, I'll get you more. The more I smoke this. The more it troubres my mind. Master. I both know about the reappearance... of the copper treasure map. I still haven't found my family's murderer. Therer's got to be a huge plot behind it The treasure map is my only lead. I must take it back. You know. Why do I want to see the play? Because all I wanted was to watch in the audience. Instead of being forced to take to the stage. But this drama of the treasure map... has been unfolding for decades. I don't want my pupil... to be forced to take to the stage. I know that the Valley... will send someone to find the whereabouts of the map. I hope master... will send me. Master. It's about time for the riddles We give out 108 prizes for riddles everyday here at Glass Beach. It's the right time. The person who will carry out this mission... will be announced by Golden Mask's people at the lantern festival. The winner today is... Mountain Ghost A mission of the importance... how can they send Mountain Ghost. No one can stop me. I've made a promise to myself... on my first day in the Valley... I'll leave the Valley as soon as I've the chance to avenge my family. To find a world that truly belongs to me. At the moment... I'm excited beyond reason. I don't know whether it's because I'm about to find. Clues for me to take my revenge Or because I see the bright lights of the future. Dragon Temple You! You maneuver the dragon body. Give me a chance. Can I try the head this time? Here. Your change. Pancakes. Hot pancakes. Don't underestimate me. They can me the Oracle. If I say you're to live, you will not die. If I say you're to die, there's no way you can live. Wait a minute. Do we... know each other? When will this blizzard end? Come on, the dragon dance is about to start. Come. Come here, the dragon dance is about to start. Come on. Hurry up Come here, the dragon dance is about to start. Governor Gu. You have to understand. The news that you have the treasure map in your possession... is now widely known. Lord Chai... is offering you 100 catty of gold... in exchange of the copper treasure map. Why do you think I'd be willing to give it up? You've seen the map. The treasures it depicts... are hidden in the capital. You won't be able to take them on your own. Mountain Ghost Fine. Give me. Who are you? Blue Asura. I'll take it from here. - You go ahead and grab the treasure map. - Yes, sir. Blue Asura. That's me. Who are you? Don't follow me. Don't go. You aren't following orders. You'd like to see the dragon dance? I'll play with you next time. Close the city gate. I want to take them alive. Yes, sir. Go ahead, I'm fine. Yes, sir. Governor Gu, sorry to have kept you waiting. Meng Die. You attacked him... and destroyed my leads. I know you're from my Valley, in disguise You know who I am? You're from my Valley. Blue Asura. Obey your orders. Did the Valley send you? White Is that White Judge? White Judge Blue Asura. You have the nerve to break the Valley's rule. Causing the death of 5 brothers from the Valley. Give me the copper map. And return to the Valley with me. We've been double-crossed. That's the standards... of a pupil of the Commander. Don't criticise my master. So what if I criticise him? I, Judge... have the authority to declare him guilty. Can you beat him in a fight? - How can you declare him guilty? - Who said so? I said so. The both of you. Which one of you is a better fighter? Me, of course. White Judge. Do you have the guts to spar with me? What kind of weapon? On her count of three. We'll each throw our dart... - See who is quicker. - Agree. You asked for trouble. One... Slow down. Two... Three. You little bastard. There's an assassin. Capture the assassin. Cone on, catch him. You go over there... Yes, sir. You go there. Yes, sir. Over there, hurry. Here's your beveraga, sir. Waiter, where my drink? Master. The word in the Valley is... Your attempt to retrive the treasure map... has put 5 of your Valley brothers in harm's way. Golden Mask has made a ruling... You didn't just break the rules... But you are a traitor to the Valley. Master. It's not that simple. There must be secrets inside the pearl. Jun-yuan. I advise you to stop. No. I must find out the secret of the treasure map. If I capture you. I'd betray my heart. But if I don't capture you... I'd betray the Valley. What do you want me to do? Unless my machete cannot... take you down. I swing my blade... and hit you in the stomach. Master... My legs... kick you. But when I'm about to turn around. You hit my right arm with your dart. Throw your dart. Your dart. Take me hostage. The woman who carry out missions for the Valley. Run. I certainly can't... capture a traitor like you at the expense of... sacrificing the more important mission for the Valley. That's why, all I can do... is to let you go. Master. Take care of yourself. Black Judge is next. You be careful. Let me take a look... what the Valley asks you to do. Take the treasure map from Governor Gu. Deliver it to the Pavilion of the Eight Gods. The Valley will arrange for receipt. What is your name? Qin Shengsheng. How did you know I'd be going to Dragon Temple today? I didn't know. I was sitting at a fortune teller's stall. I drew a fortune stick. Was it accurate? The ones in the past were accurate. I don't know about future ones. That's right. For assassins like us... The future is unpredictable. Mind if I read the poem of the fortune stick? I've thrown it away. But I remember the poem. Alone and adrift. Hoping for the weather to clear. Years go by in a putt of smoke. Snowflakes fly and I ask why. Drfting along the stream. Finally meeting a hero for one night's drink into oblivion. But what if we're not destined for each other. And the fear of parting becomes my new sorrow. How did you end up in the Ghost Valley? My parents abandoned me when I was young. I was persecuted. But the Valley saved me. I heard that your arm was chopped off... by your lover in the Valley. Is that true? She did it against her will. We were all victims. Who told you? Everyone in the Valley knows. I don's want to talk about this anymore. What happened to her? She died. I want to know. Why can's you forget her. Even after she'd chopped your arm off? She told me before she died. As long as I have the Arm of Asura with me. She's there with me. Why did anyone know the Valley's mission ahead of time. Those four Warriors from the West. Set their eyes on me as their taget. How did they know I'd be involved? It seemed like a trap set for me. I'm sure Qin saved me with her music But why didn't she admit to it. I only went to draw a fortune stick. Is she a friend or foe? I should go. I saw you yesterday. You seemed to enjoy this rice ball. So I asked the shop to make some. You can eat them on your journey. There sure is enough. I hope... As long as the rise balls are there. I there with you. Drifting along the stream. A hero yearns for drunken oblivion for one night. But I fear we're not destined for each other. Parting is such sweet sorrow. I won't say farewell. Come and take a look. Divine Tea Room Thank you sir. You hired someone from the Ghost Valley. That is to say... I am the person you hired. So why do you need all this hassle. Prince Rui. Did your overlord tell you this? At this juncture... There are not that many who can afford to hire from the Valley. Meng and Lady Fleur in South Pagoda. But in East Mulberry... It must be Chai Sheng and Prince Rui. Many desire the treasure map. But the one who desire Zhao Chang's head. Might only be Prince Rui. Then what I want... is ready. I want to ask you a question. In Dragon Temple the other day... The Warrior from the West who killed 5 of my Valley brothers. Who sent him? If I say I don't know. Would you believe me? If I say... This belongs to my family. I won't give it to you. Would you believe me? Don't put the blame on me. We had to be prepared. I'm not affillated with her in any way. Not affillated. On the count of three. If you don't surrender the treasure map. I'd make some changes... to her face. One... Two... Didn't you say you're not affillated with me? Don't move if you want to live. Who is he? Black Judge. Who? Black Judge. Black Judge Qi Jun-yuan. You can tell this Valley peasant... What I'm here to do? To enforce the family law. I understand very well. When someone gathers strength. They can't help but think about the future. I'm looking forward to the future. But this treasure map... is a piece of my past. You grew up under my watch in Valley. I don;t take pleasure in destroying your Master's efforts. I am going to make an exception for you today. If you don't return with me to the Valley. We will fight to the death. Then. You stay away. Black Judge. I will use my Arm of Asura. To face off your Yin Yang Umbrella. Go and look into the street. Why is it suddenly so quiet? The people have fled. Check from the windows for the east and west... to see how many troops have they sent. Not fewer than 300. I didn't expect Chai Kang... to have such backups. Since it was Chai Kang who hired me from the Valley. It shouldn't be him who mobilised the East Mulberry troops. Meng abd Lady Fleur are also aware of the treasure map. But they haven't made their wisnes know. I think they are the ones who've sent the troops. After all... South Pagoda's iron cavalry is challenging the Valley. We can't ever let them besmirch our name. What do you say? My lady... All is ready. Take them alive. This is the Ghost Valley. Black Judge is a force to be reckoned with. Please let me stay. I'll block the way so that you can go. Go. I'm telling you to go. You won't make it if you don't go now. I'm fine, don't worry about me. My lord. General Zhao. I've found the mole in East Mulberry. It's my brother THey hired someone from the Valley to assassinate you. My lord. No, it can't be. It must be a misunderstanding. Prince Rui has alway been so kind to me. He gave me my promotion into the cabinet. General Zhao. I have it here all the correspondence... between the ministers in the cabinet. After they were copied. I go through... each and every one of them. It includes the correspondence between my brother and the Valley. Here... are all the letters from my brother... and yours. For so many years... You've written to your wife without fail. A person who takes care of his family... is more reliable. All these years... I've been playing a game of chess... with Meng. If I make my next move correctly. I'll come out the victor. Zhao Chuang. You have to make this last move for me. This is the most important move. My lord. Don't worry. I'll send my people to take care of your wife. What does your lordship... want me to do? Unshackle him. They came to see me of their own will. That's why you could capture them. - Leave us for now. - Yes. What a handsome pair of assassins the Valley has delivered. When I look at you. I see my younger self. I'm nothing like you. I've been an orphan since I was young. Qi Jun-yuan, have you ever thought. While the Ghost Valley has a considerable reputation. Assassinations can only change the situation now. Buts can't change people's fate. - So you chose to be a Buddhist. - Yes. Because I made a mistake. For the sake of may future. I sacritice my past. So I pray every day... to ask for guidance to amend. Did you get any answers? Yes, I did. I was enlightened with a phrase. Revenge. So now I dare not to ask for anything. I just hope my man and my child would be protected. Lady Fleur. Do you know why I came to see you? It's because you have something to ask me. Now the treasure map has been returned to me. I'll hire you to do something for me. Returned to you. Of course. If I didn't arrange for it to be kept by Governor Gu. How could a man of mediocrity like him get his hands on the map. What do you want to hire me to do? When I hire an assassin, it's of course to assassinate. I used the treasure map as bait... to arrange a meeting with Chai Sheng in the Snow Pavilion. Ostensibly to discuss with him how to find the treasures. When the time comes... I want you to assassinate Chai Sheng. Why would I do such a thing for you? Because I can tell you... what you want to know. What do I want to know? The treasure map. And the truth about the annihilation of your clan. I, Chai Sheng of East Mulberry... will form a brotherly alliance with... The Lord of South Pagoda. We will join hands to find the ancient treasures. If I desire otherwise. The wrath of the heavens and men will be upon me. Heaven and earth will destroy me. I, Meng Xu of South Pagoda... with form a brotherly alliance with... Lord Chai Sheng of East Mulberry. If I desire otherwise. I will die by sword. In a moment. I'll call for you. When you tell me to leave, I'll leave. When I tell you to grab it, you grab. Today... We are brothers and allies. I'd like to invite your wife for a song... to celebrate this momentous day. When the time comes, I'll sing a song. When the opportinity comes for you to assassinate Chai Sheng. I'll give you a signal. If the love is true. We wouldn't lament we've met too late. I just hope to see you, with no regrets. Love and honour are fading like a tide... and more colourful than wilted howers. But I fear loneliness and dashed hopes. Love is like a dream. It doesn't matter if it didn't last. If our hearts are strong. Love will never fade. Parting brings destruction. I yearn for us to meet again. Love is in my heart. It won't go away. If the love is true. We wouldn't lament we've met too late. I just hope to see you, with no regrets. What does my lord want me to do... and now to do it. Assassinate Meng Xu. General Zhao. I'll deliver this chalice to the lord. I think I've seen you somewhere before? Your memory deceives you. We've never met. Capture the assassin. Someone is trying to kill his lordship. Protect the lord. Catch the assassin. Protect his lordship. Where did these skillful assassins come from? Help. My lord, it's dangerous. Master. It's the person you brought. Lord Meng. Lord Meng. Don't worry. It's over now. It's finally over. My lord. My lord. Who is it? Lady Fleur, you come to me so late at night. What instructions do you have for me? Don't worry. There's no one outside. You shouldn't have come to see me at this time. If someone sees you, our plan will be ruined. It's been decades. I've thought about you everyday. I know you blame me. I've promised you not to kill Meng Xu. But the situation has changed. I has to do it. Don't worry. The situation will be resolved very soon. Before long we'll be together again. See? You're the mastermind. You asked me to make that copper map... of a treasure that didn't exist. So that so many people... have plotted around us... for so many years. But... Whatever the outcome. It doesn't make up for what we've lost. Do you still miss our doughter? How can I not miss her. I know. To make Meng Xu take you under his wing. I forced you to abandon her. Ghost Valley... has tried to assassinate you. But why is it following your orders? Do you remember... 13 years ago.. What we want to take refuge separately. The question you asked me then? If in future, you can only choose between me and the realm. How would you choose? Of course I'd choose you. I said I'd choose you. What are you talking about? I said... I'm pleased. You asked why is Valley or No Malice following my order. It's because Lord Chai Sheng... is holding the decree of their real plan. I'm waiting for you here. Would you believe me? We meet again. I'm grateful to you for accepting my invitation. If I didn't want you to come here. Why would I lie to your men? Your lordship. The decree about the Ghost Valley is here. That's wonderful. I'd have found you soon anyway. General Zhao. I want to know... Was it you who hired the Valley to assassinate Meng Xu? I've commissioned Ghost Valley. What is your link to the Valley? Your lordship. Your servant... would like to borrow your pen. Do you know why... I was always writing to my wife? Because I knew very well... You would spy on the letters. That is why... I wrote whatever you wanted to read. The other day... When you said you'd send men... to look after my wife. I wasn't afraid at all. Because the wife I wrote to... doesn't exist. He acted as a loyal minister and a gentleman. For so many years, it must have been hard. Do you know why... You're still alive? It's because I need you to take the blame for me. Assassin! Someone is killing my lord. Assassin! Hurry. Hurry up. Someone is trying to kill his lordship. Master. Someone wants us to destroy each other. Meets me at the Red Chamber Theatre Red Chamber Theatre Jun-yuan. Commander. I said I'd do some good in these turbulent times. Believe me. I'm very close to success. Commander. I appreciate your contribution over the years... to the Valley. The sacrifice you make today... is worthwhile. I'm old. It's time for me to go. In exchange for the efforts. I've made for the Valley for decades. Golden Mask. I beg you... Allow me the last dignity... as an assassin. Commander. I'd say... farawell. Master. Master. Master. It's Golden Mask. He has Zhao's prayer beads on him. It's because I can tell you... the truth about the map... and the annihillation of your Qi clan. I've been trying to find the truth about the death of the Qi clan. But at this moment... For revenge and for my own future. As the Blue Asura of Ghost Valley. All the more reason for me to solve this plot. Golden Mask. Master taught us to kill with the machete. What kind of weapon do you use? I don't use a weapon. I use... A plot. A plot... can change an entire era. Can the plot be unraveled? If you want to solve this plot. You'd have to come up with... another plot. I announce... General Zhao to receive the Commander's Seal. I announce... General Zhao enters the palace... I congratlate your ladyship for becoming the ruler of South Pagoda. Wait untill I receive the Commander's Seal. East Mulberry will be ours too. I urge your ladyship to come... and withness our dream becoming realty. My lord. My lord. I've said... I like... watching you embroider thr royal robe. Even thoughn... I know... The robe wasn't for me. Your servant, Zhao Chuang. Pledge allegiance to the young master. Wait. General Zhao. South Pagoda and East Mulberry... have form an alliance. I have to remind you... to behalf of the two lords. I hope when you receive the Commander's Seal. You won't forget your pledge to protect the young master. I, Zhao Chuang... have never broken a promise in my life. Have you never broken a promise? Do you dare to swear to Buddha? I swear to Buddha... I will always and forever be loyal to the young master... and to protect East Mulberry. If I betray this vow... I'm willing to be punisned. To be banisned to hell everatter. Report to... General Zhao. There is a cover invasion from assassins. What? Assassins! There are assassins here. Protect his lordship. Close the gate. General. An unknown enemy has set off... all the explosives in our arsenal. Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. Who is shouting. Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. It can't be. How can it be? Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. It must be Qi Jun-yuan. Deploy my Forbidden Army. Yes, sir. Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny. Zhao Chuang. How dare you bring a sword into the palace. Protect the young lord. It's really him. Protect the royal heir and read him to safety. Wait untill I receive the Commander's Seal. I will deploy the troops to destroy the Ghost Valley. Ask Qi Jun-yuan to come out. Die! Die! Traitor. I knew you'd harm the young master. My hand was forced by the Ghost Valley. You've said... You'd choose me, between the realm and me. Now I ask you to leave with me. Would you do it? I can't. I promised... to help you calm the chaos. But now our plan has lost its meaning. Because you've changed. Yes. But the change in me... was made to accommodate the time. Indeed. We've both changed. I've lost my past. I can't see a future for us. I can't face myself. But I can start afresn. Fleur. Fleur. You... is this... Is this your new beginning? You've left me all by myselt. I will definitely... complete... complete our plan. You see? The Commander's Seal is in the box. I'll show you. You didn't foresee you'd be trapped. Perhaps you forgot. It was you who taught me to plot. Golden Mask. I've actually never understood. What is the relationship between... Golden Mask and Zhao Chuang. In fact it's very simple. You are the same person. For so long you pretended to be a loyal minister. It couldn't be easy. If you're Golden Mask. Then Lady Fleur... must be the Queen of Fire who has been... missing from the Valley for years. You asked my family, the Qi... to make a copper map... for treasures that didn't exist. So as to start a war between South Pagoda and East Mulberry. You surrendered to Chai Sheng amid the chaos. And Lady Fleur... attached herself to Meng Xu. You arranged for the Valley brothers to assassinate yourself. So that you can stage... a scene of a loyal minister being assassinated... to win Chai Sheng's trust. You knew very well. I wouldn't give up avenging my clan. So you put the blame of taking the map and treachery on me. So that the entire Valley... would focus on me, the traitor. Then you used the map as bait... to lure the South Pagoda and East Mulberry leaders to meet. And assassinated them both... at the meeting. When you received the Commander's Seal. You led the East Mulberry army... to destroy the Ghost Valley. In that way... You could cover up your treachery. You could advance your position... from the overlord of the Valley... into the overlord of the entire realm. Golden Mask. Now I ask on behalf of my brothers in the Valley. How can you face us? Times have changed. I can't say I didn't try to change the world through the Valley. You can't change anything. Because you've changed. I'm Qi Jun-yuan with a mask on. Qi Jun-yuan with my mask off. Today I don't care whether you're Zhao Chuang... or Golden Mask. I will avenge my master and the Valley. Blue Asura. It's time to enforce the family law. I'm the one... to enforce family law. Your Arm of Asura. It's time for me to take it back. I didn't try to assassinate. What I used was... a plot. A plot... can change an entire era. I've promised myself. I'd leave the Valley as soon as I've made my revenge. To find my future. Ay this moment... I recall the snowy day... and what Qin said. When will this blizzard end? I don't understand why you brought me to the Valley. I've made my plans. Where do we go after we've left? You'd like it. Golden Mask and Crimson Mask... told me here... Ghost Valley... will one day make the world... a place without hatred. They are all lies. That's why they never took off their masks. Let's go. Shengsheng. I remember my master had said... Crimson Mask gave away their child... for the sake of Golden Mask's undertaking. Shengsheng, I have to tell you. I made up that rumour. I've been thinking... Why did we meet at the Dragon Temple. And your fortune stick. Drifting along the stream. Finally meeting a hero for one night's drink into oblivion. Why was the fortune so accurate. I went to search for it at the Temple. Did you find it? How could I? It didn't even exist. Also. When you pretended to be Lady Fleur. How did you know... their child... is a girl. So now I dare not ask for anything. I just hope mu man and may child would be protected. Do you still miss our daughter? I deduced... that you are the daughter of Golden Mask and Crimson Mask. You followed me... because you wanted to see... how they've turned out? That's right I've always known... they're Zhao Chuang and Lady Fleur. So outside Dragon Temple... I saved you with the music. So that you'd continue to help me. Tha's also why I reminded you to think about... the relationship between Zhao Chuang and Golden Mask. Ghost Valley... tried to assassinate you. But why are they following your orders? I think... You must have guessed. I let Chai Kang capture me on purpose to return to you. Of course I knew. I also knew. You were captured by South Pagoda on purpose. It didn't occur to me. Apart from Golden Mask and Crimson Mask. I'd have to face... a trap set by you. Shengsheng. Is this the ending you envisioned? Shengsheng. All plots have a cost. Would you like to see me in future? I'm sure. I'll think of you everytime I have rice balls. Can't we star afresn? I have to stay and rebuild Ghost Valley. The principe of the Valley. Is to make the world... turn away from the sorrows of parting and hatred... to be without malice. The Valley's belief is magnificent. As long as the Valley exists. There's hope... for this world. If you stay in the Valley. Wouldn't you become another Golden Mask? As long as I hold fast to my beliefs... to have my intention remain unchanged... to destroy any enermies to unravel any plots. I am Qi Jun-yuan when I take on my mask. When I put on my mask. I'm still... Qi Jun-yuan.
