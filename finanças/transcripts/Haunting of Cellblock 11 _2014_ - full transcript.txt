speeding so nikki tell me about the paranormal experiences you've had here spooky [ __ ] that's what one can't say [ __ ] and two i need full sentences oh yeah yeah so Start at the beginning well i've had this place going on gosh 23 years now strange stuff happens here all the time i mean things go flying through the air doors open i hire employees one day and they quit the next because they've been so scared they've been pushed they've been touched not in the mean way but i mean just enough to say hey i'm here you know you ever get any of this on camera i'm used to it it doesn't bother me anymore it's it's just part of the ambiance you know what i mean any ideas who or what is haunting the restaurant i thought that's what you were here for to tell me [Laughter] well it wasn't always a restaurant there used to be a house built in 1926 or so but now in the 1950s there was a bunch of college kids that lived there and uh one day one of the kids uh decided to uh pack it in uh cancel a subscription if you know what i mean so he took his father's service revolver wrapped his lips around it pow blew his brains out and i think he's still here messing with the customers it's like he doesn't know who these people are in his house you know holy [ __ ] that scares you i thought you guys were professional ghost hunters tell me you got that on camera just out of frame [ __ ] okay joel i have some movement on the emf meter um okay uh let's wrap this up okay yeah i think we got everything perfect all right so let's uh let's wrap all this stuff up and uh start the hunt set up that's it yep i just need you to sign this release and we'll see you in the morning okay uh the team will investigate through the night and hopefully we will capture something okay hey nick thanks a lot oh man our uh our track record hasn't been that great lately so hopefully the spirits are really active tonight well uh good luck thanks for the pizza i got a really good feeling here you guys this is a good one rolling i am rolling okay i wasn't sure if you were all yeah right okay cool three two we're here at nikki's pizza in los angeles where for years he's been serving up slices of pie with spirits but not the 80 proof kind but not the 80 proofing that sounded lame you can get it in voiceover later okay no no i got you so it's up there ghost sightings is here at nikki's pizza where rumor has it nearly half a century ago a lonely young man took his life the business end of a pistol this may be the epicenter of the paranormal activity that has haunted this building ever since let's try to get an evp evp navy p electronic voice phenomenon is a way the spirits communicate through electronic devices the microphones pick up things that we just can't hear is there anyone here with us say something don't be shy emf levels are elevated okay okay when a ghost or spirit manifests it creates electromagnetic energy that registers on our emf meters it's stronger in here i'm definitely feeling something okay roger tap into that empathic ability what are you feeling i don't know but it's heavy i feel a sadness god damn something just flew into roger like like a light or an orb or something feeling so good it's just the same spirit that flipped over those pans earlier you okay buddy should we get you out of here i'm fine i hope it wasn't the pizza all right we're going to get you to pull back and get a wide shot it's okay i don't want to miss any of the activity here whoa on me on me okay we we've set up these cameras that only trigger if there's a fluctuation in the em fields nearby so we'll go back check the image from the camera later in the post investigation but something set this off okay everyone quiet is there anyone here say something say anything please you hear that oh i definitely heard that [Music] can you do it again [Music] hi guys you look deep morning nick let me put some coffee on let's start sweeping out the gear get ready to shoot the wrap up so How did it go last night spooky [ __ ] right feeling any better buddy i'm fine it's just draining sometimes i'm sure it's not knacked so you can get out of loading gear [ __ ] you burger oh One more mediocre investigation on the books i don't know we caught a couple of bumps and scrapes we got an episode that's what counts counts the ratings are the guy's killing us i hear some of their stuff is faked we're not doing that we need better locations maybe you need to actually put your camera at the things that do happen i've only got one [ __ ] camera kate i can't be everywhere maybe you should be able to anticipate by now burger okay okay come on every location we've covered has been active we just need to capture something more substantial than sounds the occasional evp we need apparitional evidence on tape [ __ ] who is it the devil [ __ ] this is kate yes miss son uh-huh i understand but i'd like to i'd like to let the team get some sleep we've been up all night okay okay [ __ ] she wants to see us now we have been working all night for christ's sakes it can't wait sorry guys we've been summoned hi guys miss simon is ready you need water or anything i saw last week's episode scare free thank you i am so tired of these excuses no that's not a reason that's an excuse you need to look up the definition of excuse okay how's this it's not a reason it's [ __ ] look my 11 30 is here eating [ __ ] me more after lunch guys how's it going excellent really really excellent last night we got a solid episode last night great material to promo i vomited sounds awesome okay let's get to it the ratings are slipping i i think that's because we were up against the ball game this week oh i think it's because people are watching anything but ghost sightings shows kind of suck lately what i wouldn't say suck the other guys are getting [ __ ] scary [ __ ] go [ __ ] we need more of that have you been reading the tweets lately people are obviously watching because they're talking about it they're talking about burger farting and you guys thinking it's an mvp it's evp whatever the audience thought it was a fart it makes you guys look stupid that was only one person okay look i like you guys i'm a big fan of ghost sightings but let's not [ __ ] each other it wasn't a fart the show was called ghost sightings not ghost sounds not ghosts that we kind of think are there ghost sightings what do we have to do to produce better shows and to see something there are a lot of great locations out there that we can't get to because of budget and we need more gear we need cutting edge gear okay hold on so You want me to spend more money that's your solution oh hey why don't we just pay the ghost to show up while we're at it you know give him some health benefits and a big fat pension miss simon we get calls all the time from all over these are people who are really haunted by something and they need help our help kate this isn't unicef it's a [ __ ] tv show we can't schedule paranormal activity it happens when it happens okay what about reenactments no no it's not our show then let's fix it in post you know goose it up a little it's not nothing faking it i'm not talking about faking i'm talking about enhancing enhancing what's already there what you guys think is there i just think if we had a little more time and a bigger budget yeah well you don't and neither do the other guys and they're getting [ __ ] but their [ __ ] is [ __ ] okay we're gonna table this for now let me sum it up for you if people aren't tuning in to go sightings i have a show about a town who elected a cat for its mayor and i'm ready to greenlight it i need better shows a thousand dollars to put the groceries away okay how about i put the groceries away and you do the laundry never mind so what about that asylum in kentucky it's like every amateur ghost hunting club from here to maine has violated that place we should go to europe lots of old creepy [ __ ] there yeah i'm sure ms simon will open up her checkbook for that it would be nice though we haven't had a honeymoon or a vacation in years it's not true i took you to santa fe yes where you spent the entire evening roaming the hallways of airbnb swearing that the spirit of little girl was running around you heard it i'm just saying it wasn't much of a vacation yeah um i oh i want to go somewhere where there are no kids uh no pets or ghosts no pants are you the prince of darkness we need better we need better locations better paranormal activity better stories we need better food just saying them here's a list of the emails we've gotten over the last three months i've highlighted only 12 of the 98 that sound like they have potential but i've weeded out the obvious fakes the people who want their 15 minutes and the possible crazies but i think that those 12 are an interesting start so check them out on it hey guys i just got a new device to try out em field disruptor awesome did the other guys have it no we're the first that's what i'm talking about what's it do It's like a giant degasser i don't know what that is basically it neutralizes the electromagnetic energy in a room right eliminate spirit energy elim not interested um what about ships i got a cool ship graveyard up north you know i get seasick you barf in every episode anyway so what difference does it make excuse me I'm empathic you're pathetic so we're still going to that house in stockton right no we got scooped by the other show a woman called a few days ago said that she didn't realize that there were other ghost shows and she thought she was signing an exclusive with us i hope she has an incubus sorry to interrupt just just make a a a list of the the best of the worst and and narrow it down a little yeah amy there's a man here to see you oh i don't have any appointments should i ask him to come back what does he want he says he has a haunted property really haunted help you i hope so i'm ben gaffney i have a bit of a a ghost problem i understand you fix that sort of thing we investigate that sort of thing fixing is That's something else i don't think i understand the difference well we have to figure out what the problem is first is it an act of haunting or residual energy sometimes it's nothing electrical anomalies nearby power lines oh I can assure you this is no anomaly what makes you say that this has been going on for years i used to just accept it but as i get older it's taken quite a toll on me spirits sometimes attach themselves to people it's not uncommon but most of the time these things are harmless does this look harmless whatever it is i believe it won't rest until i'm gone and who knows maybe even that it'll torment me um Well we uh we are looking for a property to investigate oh Oh i have the property i think i know exactly where the energy originates from i'm flying home this evening i was just here visiting my grandchildren innocent little creatures you have children no No we um we've not been so blessed they're the best ghost hunters of them all wouldn't you say unbiased receptors that haven't yet been infected by cynicism that comes with age well leave your information and we'll get in touch with you no i need you to help me these things are real and unrelenting i need you to find them identify them and then send them on their way if ever i'm to rest peacefully i can assure you you won't be disappointed beautiful out here make sure we get some exterior b-roll copy that okay guys we're shooting our wad on this one extra gear manpower i just hope that old man is in a nut bowl i hate that term light bulb shooting a wad we need to capture something anything poltergeist activity apparitions mists shadow figures we need to roll video on every square inch in this place i don't want to miss a thing what is the location exactly an abandoned prison he didn't say too much poor guy is pretty spooked doesn't even want to talk about it on camera did he give us any contacts yeah someone's supposed to meet us there looks like we're close good i'm hungry [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh here's some petty cash uh pick up some water snacks juices we're gonna grab a quick bite you guys sure you don't want anything i think we're all right i'm good we'll just meet you at the location great [Applause] hi Take a hi folks hey something to drink uh sweet tea please all around sounds good call it for me one check hello know what you want yeah um burger with cheese extra onions extra mayo extra onions burger really i like onions uh Chicken sandwich please it's dry anything gluten-free salad dressing on the side i'm good with just the tea hi You can't have babies excuse me you can't have babies okay thanks so i got the address for the prison it says everything's unlocked what prison we're uh we're ghost hunters we're investigating nearby prison for a tv show i wouldn't go there they should have torn it down a long time ago oh you know we're like first responders they run into burning buildings we run into haunted properties that's why you can't have babies because you've got ghouls inside that's enough me bird oh don't mind her oh no it's okay most people don't understand what we do i'm still trying to wrap my head around it Do yourself a favor and go back where you come from you're messing with the devil's work i appreciate your concern but we've done this like 100 times it's just another location no it's not we all know someone who's been connected to that place a convict administrator someone it never ended good well we're professionals they all was [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] holy [ __ ] it's beautiful nothing else you have a million dollar set piece i'm gonna shoot some establishing shots cool i think our luck just changed oh i hope so god damn it what camera battery died i just changed it you sure you swapped it for a charged one yes kate i'm just asking come on i'm dying to get in there don't say that let's get that gear inside and find a place to set up the control room [Music] oh far out there's electricity in the air you can feel it right standing up on my arms i'm slightly nauseated in a good way oh [ __ ] what happened my arm i want to scratch it on a case or something all right well let's see oh Whoa uh you need to go back into town to find a doctor to take a look at that no i'll be fine no i Can't have anyone getting tetanus with lockjaw who knows what's lurking around this place drive them back into town while you're there might as well start researching folks interview tomorrow i'll be in touch if i can get a signal all right we'll be back tomorrow morning uh sun up oh and bring coffee good coffee [ __ ] interns guys there's nothing over here that could have scratched them like that maybe we have an angry little spirit running around remember the kid's just clumsy cut himself in a zipper or something i don't know what i do know is now we're two men down what were you saying about our luck changing it's okay it's okay all right this is our one little hiccup and we got it out of the way early good all right okay let's rock and roll let's do it we are here at the old freely state penitentiary where it's rumored that we do it again ready in three two one we are here at the freeling state penitentiary where it is rumored that dozens of old souls are sentenced to eternity without the possibility of parole does that sound lame honey sound a little lame it's a little lame right just keep going we'll edit okay men were sentenced to life in hell here behind these walls where some say even though the facility closed a dozen years ago tormented entities still remain incarcerated cut that was great so i'm late oh it's fine we were just finishing up a little intro timing was perfect hi i'm kate you spoke we did clive hey class joel hi hey burger hi roger hello i've seen your show you look taller on tv so how'd you hear about this place anyway the word travel that's surprising folks around here don't like to talk about it much we noticed yeah these things have a way of finding us People call looking for help we hear there's a lot of activity here so you signed all the releases with the county right uh took care of that before leaving los angeles you know if it were up to me i'd make you get back in your car and head on back home but they say this generates revenue for the town so i'll do what i'm told well clive we're going to be losing light here soon so what we'd like to do is shoot a tour with you uh let you show the team around on camera yeah we'll get you out of here before dark and just do our thing sounds good especially the part about getting the outboard dark [Music] we are here with resident expert clive daniels who is going to show us around the freeling state penitentiary and tell us stories of its haunting past and its haunted present clive thanks for being here so how old is this place it's built in the mid-1800s actually used until about 10 years ago the repairs got too expensive now they just don't have funding to either keep her up or tear her down right now prisons uh tend to hold a lot of negative energy uh an emotional time capsule of sorts which makes them very active in paranormal activity would you agree well a hundred years if murderers and rapists locked inside a box will do that i suppose get stabbings killings suicides prison seems to bring out the worst in people and not just the inmates but sometimes the guards administrators what i mean is there are these stories about this doctor that used to work here a long time ago and he did all kinds of unspeakable things to the inmates until he was caught before my time the rumor is that he wound up behind bars himself but he didn't last long payback's a [ __ ] anyway it was a dark time for the institution that's for sure now obviously we're here to investigate the paranormal activity that's been reported but you are are you a believer do you think this place is haunted let's go to the cell a lot of people have had experiences there okay let me go to this whole block cool now this is probably where most of the activity occurs voices people being touched we got a lot of photos with those on there what are they called uh orbs oh or ja right there uh balls of light that some people think are spirit energy is still bound to this world and people see figures sometimes shadows we had a tour group come through here once and and up there on the third tier they saw a figure looking down we think it was a prisoner who died here in 1958 ephraim chamberlain he's kind of a kingpin in here yeah you think his his spirit's still here i do he was sourced a lot of trouble when he was alive he attacked a guard once he dragged him into his cell and broke his neck he bit off chunks of flesh never eaten half his face including one of his eyes by the time they got to it the poor bastard lived like that for a while that forgot his come up and they assigned him to experimental therapy with the good doctor and that was enough to break it after a few months they found him hanging in his cell well we'll definitely get uh some coverage here the cell block and see if ephraim makes an appearance we better not hope too hard the spirit's been known to attack people in here scratches and bites them one mean son of a [ __ ] and that's to put it mildly oh man yep all right oh boys and set so clive has this property been investigated before because it seems like just a gold mine for paranormal activity oh yeah it has sometimes nothing happens but sometimes there was this this amateur group that came and spent the night a few years back and when we got them out let's put it this way they were no condition to talk about what they found now a number of murders occurred in here stabbings even a drowning drowning in a kitchen inmate killed another inmate by holding his head in a pot of boiling water nobody found it for quite a while the funny thing was there were a lot of compliments on the soup that night wow that's a joke people hear a lot of noises in here throughout the whole building in fact hear things like shackles jangling moaning cell doors opening and closing they say whenever you hear a cell door open and close it's ephraim coming for somebody otherwise he's just like spending time in his cell he was like that that peace in his cell can we see the infirmary yeah sure it's in the basement oh it's crazy you should well here we are the bowels of the beast the doctor did his work some say it's still here all right let's go inside no I won't go in there every man has this limit and i draw the line at this doorway what exactly was he doing in here well i heard that he'd dope his victims up put him in a an insulin-induced coma then do his experiments i kind of got the idea that might be more therapeutic if they could feel what he was doing to them so He found some way to temporarily paralyze him by injecting these poor guys with something or other then he put him on a ventilator so they were breathing but otherwise completely awake so that they felt everything that he was doing his experiments made no sense he sterilized some inject them with things like ground glass acid those are the lucky ones his favorites he'd do you know sexual things too basically he would rape and torture them he called him his fallen angels over a period of 20 years or so they estimate there were maybe 45 men that he raped tortured and mutilated who knows if it's even true joel we need to wrap up the tour starting it dark oh yeah yeah right right right um great let's do a little uh exit course yeah very good let's get you um very good so clive thank you so much for sharing your stories it's been uh hey what's wrong nothing no sorry i thought i i thought i saw someone here um yeah sorry go ahead okay what was that it happens all the time em feels are elevated it's faint though you're sure there's no way someone else could be inside the building no no this place is sealed up tight the door we came in it's the only way in around joel oh right here yeah um okay so uh so clearly this location is very active and tonight we'll try to shed some light on who or what still haunts the freeling state penitentiary as we go on the hunt and cut cool right thank you so much that was fantastic really appreciate it are you sure you want to do this don't worry we're professionals suit yourself come on i'll walk you out uh you guys get all the cameras rigged and set up the control room all right cool we're gonna need a camera on this door listen it's none of my business but you seem like nice people don't do this don't stay here i appreciate your concern but honestly we've been doing this longer than i care to remember i'm sure the network's gonna love this episode [ __ ] the network let me put this to you straight young lady you're putting your life in the line for the sake of a tv show and not a very good one at that honestly sir the team is good really good at the worst joel's been pushed once in a while roger gets a little sick sometimes and i've never seen or felt anything myself by morning we'll have a new show in the can and be a few more frequent flyer miles closer to a vacation you folks in l.a think we're just a bunch of dumb biscuits out here but we're not in l.a [Music] [Music] okay i think we have every angle covered i have eight night vision set up in all the major rooms and hallways i have an array of still cameras wired to em field detectors and you're also gonna get the wireless feed from my handheld camera if it moves appears manifest generates energy something will record it hopefully hopefully yeah come on man i mean it's not your first rodeo hopefully all right well we've got five times the gear so five times the chance of actually capturing something and we've spent five times the budget so if this bombs out our next hunt will be in berger's apartment our scariest location yet stop it where's the faith it's waning got a call a couple days ago from this travel show i wouldn't mind producing a series about pristine beaches and tiki bars it's boring come get on you need everything i need [Music] yep recording now everything's going down to the hard drive are you picking me up clearly good luck guys and be careful [Music] hmm of course there's no signal all right we're gonna go check out the kitchen area okay i'm on you roger you picking up anything nothing not even a blip no maybe it's a cologne scaring them away like a bug strip clever it's okay we got all mine let's go check out the kitchen there's a little activity in here but it could be a junction box or something as far as i know there's no power in the building static buildup maybe i mean there is a lot of metal in here or it could be the ghost of a [ __ ] psycho killer let's hope definitely sensing something in here i don't know what let's try to get an evp let's use the talker see if it wants to speak to us is anyone here we're in your kitchen does that bother you you want to stick my head into a pot of boiling

check the cameras we can cover more ground we'll find them someplace those those things drained all the power out of everything all the cameras are down okay okay gotta get out there and find them oh yeah i say we should just stay here until daybreak i don't think roger's got that kind of time he's probably in shock his systems are shutting down okay and for all we know burger's in the same condition we gotta find him and find a way out of here let's change the dressings beyond that i think the best thing we can do for him is just get out get help what do you think the girl at the diner meant when she said i can't have babies ah i don't know um she seemed no she didn't seem right you know but we haven't been able to get pregnant she said that i have ghouls inside me maybe she's right maybe this work has infected us in some way and maybe we have ghouls and demons and they're inside us and they prevented us from you know all right all right let's just let's just get out of here and and then we can and we can have some babies love lots of lots of little little ghost hunting babies no oh come on [Music] let me rephrase it hell no i am done with ghost hunting okay um i think that i have done all that i can do here what do these things want you're trying to tell us something yeah get out leave us alone we should go to the cell bot that's where roger was attacked why would we go there well roger's empathic right so they naturally want to crawl into him communicate through him doesn't mean they can do with everyone i don't know joel but hey what about what clive said about ephraim chamberlain he was only at home when he was in his cell so maybe they took burger there took him there damn joe we're talking about ghosts not a pack of wolves we gotta look everywhere fine

i got a signal [Music] mr gaffney i'm cold as [ __ ] i'm gonna wait in the car cool this won't be long i was excited to get your phone call you said you completed the investigation yes we did and you were right this seems to be the epicenter of a very active haunting marvelous not only did we get audible evidence but for the first time we actually recorded apparitional evidence as well how interesting come on inside i want to see if you notice a shift in the energy feels different not like the old days but different the old days yes i was employed by the prison staff physician not a pleasant job i can assure you but an honest paycheck this was a busy place back in the day it was my job to look after these wretched creatures ironic really keeping them well unfit so they could live a long healthy life while they waited to die i called them my little fallen angels made the work less arduous somehow is something wrong uh We heard a story about the doctor arrested here for doing horrible things but they say the inmates killed him it's an old institution there are many persistent rumors besides these were abhorrent men they deserve their fate wouldn't you agree if by fate you mean mutilation and torture and worse then no i'm thankful that the spirits have gone now i can live the rest of my life in peace i didn't say they were gone what what did you say isn't that why you came here mr gaffney no one can fully comprehend the paranormal most of the times it's harmless but sometimes it's not in fact last night we couldn't get out because someone put a chain on the door i knew if there was any weakness in you you'd try to leave i couldn't allow that to happen wait a minute you locked us in i had to keep you focused on the task at hand one of our team members died we all could have died that's the trouble with your generation no veracity you had a job to do here young lady from the sound of it you failed excuse me dr gaffney if it wasn't for what you did to your little fallen angels they'd be able to move on what i did i pioneered treatments that targeted psychopathic currents that ran deep within these these creatures these were rehabilitative therapies that had never been tried before or since for good reason i should be lauded not vilified well this is insane i think we're done here let's go joe hold on hold on hold on one second maybe the good doctor's right he asked us to rid him of these entities and we failed indeed but there is a way to help these creatures move on yes there is right here three two one what are you doing it's just until morning i feel there's only one sure way to uh rid you of your entities which is what you wanted us to do right you can't do this no we have to give them what they want so they can finish their unfinished business you can't leave me you think that travel show yours needs a charming host i'm into tiki bars sounds good to me [Music] you can't leave me here like this so what now well now we cut together a
