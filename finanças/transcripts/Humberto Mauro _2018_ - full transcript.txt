1BDO calling Hello, 1BDO calling PYL4 DO Cataguases calling 1BDO South Volta Grande calling, 1BDO 4AXB, 4AVC 1BDO called, on the frequency PYL4 AXB, 4AXB, 4AXB PY 1BDO calling 5AIM 5 A I M Nature issue There are moments of nature that if you do not shoot, you will not shoot anymore, ever. will never present itself again in the same way. I like nature in any way, with rain, without rain, with fog, with sun the night, the light of the moon we have to surprise the nature I for example when I go to shoot a waterfall I do not film so immediately I hide behind a banana tree or something like that for the waterfall not knowing that it is being filmed Otherwise the water will start to fall different I was born on April 30, 1897 3:15 a.m. And I went to Cataguases And there I did an electric tramway course by correspondence My grandfather said Humberto graduated in the bedroom The cinema came a long time later I always liked photography I went to the cinema there in Cataguases Because of photography We were seen as crazy And we are still, until today. a little crazy. We even imagine doing gliders There were hills there, and we were going to fly over Cataguases I talked to them. So, in this case, let's make movies. In the "lost treasure" I felt much difficulty Because I had to play the villain My wife played the role of the young heroine My brother Chiquinho the hero's role Even our dog worked too But Mauro, what was the cinematographic environment of Cataguases at that time the cinematographic environment of Cataguases did not exist The cinematographic environment was me. It was me, Mr. Pedro, and my family. in my family everyone supported me There were times when my family and I suffered from hunger I've always made the cinema truly regional, I can be from Minas Gerais and be a national just as I can be national and universal Universalizing a Brazilian theme, I can universalize a theme I can make Brazilian a subject of Minas Gerais So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. So many people to eat, only me to crush. But in many parts of Brazil there are still primitive sugar mills like the one whose names made dreaming and inspired songs When progress advance through the fields and modern agricultural properties are built, everywhere It is in the old farms, in the rural area of Minas Gerais, where are nested, a little of the customs, the tastes, even the life of our farmers great-grandparents Washerwoman what happened, It's not my fault it came very strong rain and carried the handkerchief what happened, It's not my fault it came very strong rain and carried the handkerchief I've been following the river Washerwoman As the lambari does Washerwoman Looking for love from afar Washerwoman that the love that was near I already lost Washerwoman Progress is anti-photogenic It is anti-photogenic But why? Because this is something I've been observing for a long time For example, the water wheel, the water wheel has a beauty an extraordinary photogeny that slow roll, the mosses the water beating with the sun a beautiful photograph You change through a wall of concret It's not good. You take an ox car and put it on top of the hill with the sky behind. Progress is anti-photogenic It is anti-photogenic But why? Progress is anti-photogenic It is anti-photogenic But why? The water wheel stopped and the poetry left with it I, for example, never studied that film movement how to do continuity and this kind of thing. these men who know who studied in courses in Europe, in all these places, in Italy I'm going to shoot with the spirit of the sequence here I have to do that or that at that moment it's as if I'm writing It's my process, different. I think nobody does like this It seems that it is born in the person a crazy thing It's already inside you. Michelangelo said that the sculpture already comes inside the block you just have to hit with the hammer that is coming out I usually say that the film is already inside the machine Is it within you? Yes, it's inside. just put it in focus fix things, push the button, it comes out. one day progress brought steam from the beginning there was difficulty with exhibition of the movie The Lost Treasure we managed to show here in Rio de Janeiro one day at 10 pm in Mr. Pinfield's Central Cinema. My brother Haroldo wrote me a card like this: Victory! Victory! Victory! Pinfield will pass the Lost Treasure For the colony of Minas Gerais at 10 pm in the Central all production generates loss what will generate profits is the exhibition And those films managed to pay the money spent? The "Lost Treasure" paid, all of them were paid, but they only paid the expenses The Lost Treasure was produced by a company What we founded in Cataguases, called Phebo Brasil Filmes Distribution, trusts, that ruins everything. Until today, we're struggling with it. For example, if someone tells me Mauro you need to make a movie I say I can not to get the money borrowed I have to write everything correctly and I have to send the person he person reads and says: no, this is not good terrible complication Dr. Roquete Pinto said that Brazilian cinema will never leave the "more or less" While we can not use film in large quantity the person without the freedom of creation and realization can not do nothing you can not give a single sheet of paper for an architect to do a project If the paper ends, what will it do? He is going to say: I need another paper Oh god of Aimore, you turn to us. your faithful tribe all is prostrated to you. prostrated only to you. And arriving here in Rio, Mauro... I came to Rio Gonzaga invited me. had a very good argument for the movie Lips without Kisses It was a comedy we became friends so I told him I had made a movie "In the spring of life", I brought here for him There was a moment when he even wanted to go to Cataguases to work there but it was the opposite, I came here to Rio He was one of the men who most stimulated my intelligence and opened my mind to the movie movement. Gonzaga knows a lot of cinema. Very sincere. However, Georges Sadoul, whom you quoted He says I'm a great filmmaker it is his opinion, in particular. but what I like the most is that precisely because of him being a historian, a connoisseur of all the great movies of all the styles and of all the great directors He says I have my own style. that I have no influence from anyone. It is very important for me Because I thought was influenced by these great American directors and Germans, of the time Did you start reading books about movies? No, I did not read It did not exist. What book existed about cinema at the time? It should be magazines, interviews James Cruze, for example, read a lot, his interviews The James Cruze was one of those very simple men and I thought cinema is simple that there is no difficulty But did you study analyzing the movies? Did you study analyzing the films you saw? To be able to form your personal experience? Yes, I was studying. But did you watch the movies more than once? Did you watch these films more than once? No, just once. just once. Our biggest concern was the framing. No other way, it was necessary to have a beauty Otherwise, how would I frame it? If you say it's horrible, we do not shoot. We studied on our own all these subjects that language they call punctuation in cinema the fade out, fade in, fusion all this is in the Lost Treasure And you made a telephoto lens? The telephoto lens. With a tube of milky flour. painted black inside. The fade out in the movie "Lost Treasure" we made in the diaphragm I divided the argument into sequences sequence from the office then to the sequence of the horseback ride and so on, for the other sequences and each sequence then... what I call scenario is the unfolding of each sequence in the shooting plan. Because scene in cinema is different from scene in theater in the theater, they say, that's when the person comes in and out in the cinema stopped the machine, another scene comes, I call it scenery . This scenario I always did improvising. I ripped my dress. I ripped my dress because of you. Ganga Bruta started in 1932 and ended in 1933. we stayed two, three months without filming. Waiting Gonzaga get money to make the movie because he did not have the money either after a certain time, arrived two rolls of negative We celebrated, great two negative rolls And the actor was fatter than before it was a trouble Sisters and mothers always bothered me at the movies. They always bothered me. For example, to show half a span of the thigh I need to do a round table discussion Why not, or why, yes, it is necessary, it is not necessary Dona Nene, I apologize, a great lady. was the sister of the actress Dea Selva always controlled this matter related to clothing told her, you come with a light dress Because it will fall into the water, and I wanted the body to be marked Because it was there that Durval saw that that awakened in him that sensual movement Because until that moment he was not seeing any of this in that girl And then Dona Nene brought a clothes that not even with all the water of the Bay of Guanabara was able to wet it as it should to leave the dress marking the body What have you done today Januario? What I did today? Yes, what have you done today? Today I made a scandal there in the town hall. and I walked there by the hacienda screaming like crazy Acting. Yes because now I am acting. Well my friends the moment is solemn, it's not for jokes I will give the people the knowledge of the Agricultural Recovery Alphabet And I do it with satisfaction. Because this alphabet was supervised by myself and carefully compiled by the PLI PLI, PLI, Januario! PLI, PLI, Januario! PLI, PLI, Januario! PLI, PLI, Januario! My friends, making the film "The Song of Longing" I had the purpose of paying homage to the people of Volta Grande who also collaborated in the making of the film and my parents and my grandparents who were born and lived many years in that region. had an ox-driver, an employee of a farm who was in love with a beautiful brunette This girl liked him too. but it was a brotherly passion, a platonic love So she marries another man He was in love, he was so sad that he disappeared. But how did he disappear? I do not know, he disappeared. They did not kill him, did not die, was not killed or committed suicide, disappeared. Well, but I've been listening, and a lot of people listen, In the afternoon, in the cane plantation, when the wind blows, his accordion is heard. Zum, zum, zum In the middle of the sea Zum, zum, zum In the middle of the sea It is the wind that delays us It is the sea that disturbs us To reach the port Zum, zum, zum In the end when he disappears Cinematographically, I did it this way The colonel arrives on the balcony. But what a beautiful afternoon. Beautifull Hey Galdino! Hey Galdino! So I film the landscape empty I make a fusion, with another landscape and he shouting: Hey Galdino! another fusion with a long shot Hey Galdino! another "long shot", far away, with the sun disappearing. Hey Galdino! And disappeared. It's a way of ... You guys are critical and you did not talk about that. I was not critical at the time of The Song of Nostalgia Oh no? But the movie is there, you can see and talk. Here is the alphabet my friends Attention, "A" assist and augment "B" benefit, breaking the hight prices and insinuations that could hamper the progress o projected accomplishments A, B, C... C, construct and cede loans to farming and if possible without interest A, B, C... D Disseminate agricultural knowledge! Agricultural... Agricultural, Janu?rio! Agricultural, Janu?rio! Agricultural, Janu?rio! And this is not enough? Not enough! Not enough! Not enough! Attention! Attention! I'm asking my friends. Is not that enough? Not enough! Not enough! Not enough! Please stop! Come on! Please excuse me, You had to say enough, and I'm going to say it is not enough. Otherwise, you spoil the end of my platform completely. Enough? Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! You're saying enough but Colonel Janu?rio says: it's not enough! Is not enough why? Because I will give you more! I'll give each one of you ... Take note ... I'll give each one of you... Home, food and washed clothes! Home, food and washed clothes! New mill, new mill, new mill pushes the wheel to spin. New mill, new mill, new mill pushes the wheel to spin. Then began to come these boring documentaries with the guy talking forever ... The guy stays out of his life and shows nothing. It's that boring guy talking, bi bi bi, bo bo bo bo bo, ba ba ba, that you do not understand anything. Here comes an old man talking, suddenly it's a child talking, It's suddenly the talking teacher. The guy was supposed to show things, And let the person talking in the background What do you think? I never put anything on paper in my movies, nothing. It had no script, I mean, some had, on the other hand, In case the script is only to follow follow the story. But there are other things low-angle shot, high-angle shot, plong?e, details... You do at the moment, my friend. Filming right at the first shot, or did you repeat a lot? It was repeated as long as I could. I had a person with me who was marking the repetitions And there came a point that I said, I only can do one more repetition because this scene is already on 850 cruzeiros and I can not spend more money When I left Cin?dia, I was in a tremendous situation, that's what I say, Dona B?be, always firm., there holding on. Sleeping on the floor. Suffice it to say that this my daughter Martha who was born here in Rio, My lady was in pain and I had to knock on the door of Mr. Trancoso a baker my friend who lived near, in the corner to arrange with him fifty thousand reis loans to fetch the midwife.. I owed nine months rent. Truly eating more cheese than anything else. So I made a movie here at the Samples Fair for Lourival Fontes. I did it to get some money. It was a darned success there at home. I paid the house rent, I paid several things. There was the old lady in her place came the fly to do wickedness with her the fly on the old lady and the old lady to spinning there was the fly in its place the spider came to hurt him the spider on the fly, the fly on the old lady and the old lady spinning. there was the spider in its place the mouse came to do wickedness with it. the mouse in the spider, the spider in the fly the fly on the old lady and the old lady spinning From 1936 to here my life was limited to working exclusively at the Institute of Educational Cinema the cat in the mouse in the spider, the spider in the fly the fly on the old lady and the old lady spinning And you did these two hundred and forty movies? Yes, I was invited in 1936 by Dr. Roquete to collaborate in the foundation I accepted, as I said, because I was sure to be collaborating in a work of creation. National Institute of Educational Cinema Department of Educational Film Presents So I went with Daddy. I started there at INCE since I was young. Zequinha I think he is a formidable operator Both he and Luiz. Luiz is a little more daring than Zequinha, but they helped me a lot. And he and he got the idea of making these series, so he made one for the experience with only one lens, only one filter, with that bad tripod. "The Little House" Do you remember the little house, where our love was born? Do you remember the little house, where our love was born? It had a coconut palm on the side What a pity for longing has died. It had a coconut palm on the side What a pity for longing has died. The Discovery of Brazil has these things. All the music is by Villa-Lobos. At the time it was the most expensive film Brazilian film made until that moment It cost about 600 contos Those caravels were even built Two caravels, the sailing caravel was complete, The other was made in half, was mounted in the studio of Cin?dia To make the interiors As the scene of the visit of these Indians the others were miniatures In the Discovery of Brazil I played violin under the regency of Villa-Lobos He was waiting for the violinist. I had to record some kind of fado I told, maestro, I play the violin. But the only thing I had to do on the violin was play the note D Only one note . The guy was doing it there. And he said: now! And I played D Land! Land! Land! Land! Land! When I went to Venice I took 3 movies Two from the Institute, Vit?ria R?gia and Sky of Brazil And I took the Discovery of Brazil, but was shown out of competition because it had already been shown in Portugal, but they liked it I was in Italy in 1938 representing Brazil I was the first person to represent Brazil at an international film festival, at the Venice Biennale. I accept these things in the certainty of being representing A large group of pioneers that we have to respect It must be known that Dona B?be was a heroine in this film movement Me and Bebe were taken in Cataguases like the Romeo and Juliet And we are still to this day, but older.
