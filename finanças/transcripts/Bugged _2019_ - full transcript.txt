Oh, Cosmo! [laughs] Oh hey, where are you going, Cosmo? Oh yeah. - Oh, Flutterby is really sick, and I'm taking her some of her favorite food. - Oh, favorite food? - Yeah well, I gotta get going, see you. - Hang on, Cosmo, I'm coming with you. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming! - So, Flutterby, do you feel any better? Here, I brought you some of my special reserve chocolates. Come on, try some, they're good for your health. - Oh, thank you. You are amazing for doing this. [cries] - Oh, don't cry, Flutterby, it's okay. - Whoa, there's tons of food, yummy for me. I guess there's one advantage to being sick. Being sick, I've got an idea. [laughs] - Time for some dumpster scavenging. [Joe coughing] Huh? Hmm, Joe seems ill. What's wrong? Hey hey hey, Joe. [Joe gasps] - Achoo, achoo, achoo, achoo! - Are you all right? Hold on, you're sick too? - I am. - Really, I can't imagine you getting sick. Okay, just lie down, I'll go find you something to eat. - Oh, thank you, Cosmo. [Joe laughs] [Joe coughs] - Oh. [Joe coughs] Oh, Joe Croaker, you don't seem well. Is it a bad cold? I've brought you some of my best pollen. You're going to love it. - You are so sweet, Flutterby, yeah you are. - Joe, you better get some rest, and I'll come see you again tomorrow. - [laughs] The sick one gets the worm. [laughs] - Hey, Joe, I told everyone at the marsh that you're sick. They're coming to see you, okay? - [laughs] Oh yeah, look at all this wonderful food just for Joe Croaker, all for me! [laughs] - Oh, it's no fun without Joe around. Huh, that's it. I've gotta find a way to cure that sick frog. [Niddy singing] Well, hey there, Niddy. - Hmm? - Joe Croaker's sick, can you help him out? - Joe is sick? Well, I think I can. I've got something right here. - What is that thing? - It's an herbal medicine. Now, you run along, and give it to him right away. - Oh, thank you Niddy, I'll see you around. - [chomping] Oh, this is delicious. - Hey, Joe. [Joe gasps] I got some medicine from you from Niddy. She says it'll make you feel better. Soon you'll be on the road to recovery. - Oh? [chomping] [Joe gags] [Joe spits] That's just bitter! - I can see you're much better, maybe you don't need any. - No. [coughs] I feel awful. - Well, maybe I'm wrong. So, just in case you should take your medicine. [Joe chomping] [Joe blubbers] I don't think these herbs are working too well. I need another cure. - [coughs] Oh, oh, oh! For the sake of all of this food, I must remain sickly. [spits] I don't like medicine. - Oh, what to do. Hmm, McBroom knows stuff about stuff. McBroom, McBroom! It's Joe, he's really really really sick, and the medicine I gave him isn't working. So, maybe you have an idea. - You should've told me this earlier. Sure I've got a better idea. Let's stick a dung ball in his mouth. - Huh, really? [Joe snores] [Joe murmurs] Hey, Joe, Joe, wake up, come on and sniff this. Sniff it good, Joe, it'll bring you back to health. - [screams] What are you doing with that dung ball? - McBroom told me this is a legendary dung ball that has great healing powers. Come on, sniff away! - Cosmo, that's something I just won't do. - Oh, Joe, just ignore the smell if you really wanna get better. Come on, Joe, just sniff it. - Get that away from me. [groans] - Joe, it's for your own good, hurry up. Joe, look, what's that over there? - Huh? - Sniff it! - [gasps] Achoo! [groans] [Joe coughs and spits] You! - Oh, but don't you feel better? [Joe groans] - Cosmo, I'm all dizzy. [groans] - [sighs] Maybe the dung ball ain't magic. [Joe laughs] [Joe snores and murmurs] Hurry up, man, it's Joe's inside. [Joe screams] Joe, Mantis here is gonna perform surgery on you. - Say what? - Oh yes, surgery. - Surgery? - Yep. - Yeah, I'm the best saw bones in town, ha ha ha ha ha! - Trust him, Joe, his arms are sharp. - Oh no, no, no! - Come on, trust me. - No, no, no, no, no! - One slice and you'll be nice! - All right. - Don't worry, Joe, I'll be here with you through the whole operation. [Joe groans] - Oh, right about here. - Don't panic, just relax. [Joe groans] - No, no, don't do it, Mantis! I'm not, I'm not sick, I'm not sick, I'm not sick! Leave me alone! [cries] - [Cosmo and Mantis] Huh? - Oh, Cosmo, Cosmo, you pesky fly! How dare you leave this disgusting stinking thing in my house! It smells so bad! [screams] [Cosmo laughs] - [groans] Ow, that really hurt. - Cosmo. - I'm really... - Cosmo. [Cosmo screams] - Oh, Joe, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Joe. Please, please don't hurt me, please. Would you forgive me, please? - I won't forgive. - Please forgive me. I'm sorry, Joe, you're the boss. You can easily break my sweet fragile wings. Huh? - [sniffs] Oh yeah. Huh? Huh, what is this? [sniffs] Ah, that's lovely. - Joe Croaker, you found something good? Would you like to share it with me, huh? Oh, isn't that a... [groans] - Hey, Cosmo, I'm not sharing with you, beat it! [Cosmo whimpers] [Joe laughs] [Joe screams] - Huh? [Cosmo laughs] - Huh? - I bet that's the first time you volunteered to have your mouth washed out with soap. [laughs] [Cosmo screams] - Ah, wow! - Help me! [groans] - Ah, that's great. That soap thingy makes everything so shiny. Yeah, I love it. - Hey, Flutterby, how about coming over and giving my place a once over? - Hmph. - [laughs] I'll pay you back somehow, a massage or-- - Cosmo, can you please just be quiet already? - Well, I just wanted to tell you that Joe found a bar of soap and I was thinking you could do yourself a favor by using it to spruce up your home a bit, not that it needs it. - Cosmo, I said be quiet! Cosmo, I... Huh? A stain! [screams] Cosmo, you tainted my flower petal. - Really? - Look! Oh no, what will I do? Trust you, Cosmo, you didn't wash your hands after eating. And wherever you go, you leave your nasty print. - I think you should go pay Joe a visit. He still has that bar of soap. Not only will it remove the stain, but it'll make your place smell even more wondferfuler. - Is it really that special? - Trust me, it works like a piece of magic. - So, while I go ask Joe for the soap, Cosmo, you can stay here and make my flower look extra pretty. - Not a problem, whatever you wish. Oh, that girl. [Joe singing] - This soap turned out really useful. I better hide it. - Joe Croaker. - Huh? - Oh, Flutterby, how can I help you? - Well, I was wondering if I can borrow your bar of soap. - What, my soap, how do you know about that? - Well, it's-- - Cosmo told you. - I see, but I promise to give it back to you. - Hmm, okay, I'll let you borrow it. [coughs] But I warn you, you can't keep it long. - Yes yes, I know. - All right here, take it. - [laughs] Thank you, Joe Croaker, you can be quite lovely. [Joe laughs] [Flutterby singing] Wow, this soap is unbelievable. [laughs] - I wonder what she's doing with it. - Joe Croaker, here's your soap, I'm all done. - Thank you. Oh, why is it so small? - Because I cleaned my petals. - Oh, my lovely soap. It's all Cosmo's fault anyway. He's such a gossip around here. Oh, my cute little soapy woapy. - Joe Croaker! What a lazy frog, wakey wakey. - I'm not sleeping. - [laughs] Hey, Joe, I was just wondering if I could borrow that soap. - No, you can't, Mole Cricket. - Oh, come on. You see, look what Mole Cricket's got just for you, huh. - One? No way. - But wait, there's more. - Ah! - Just look at all this nutty goodness. So, can I borrow the soap bar now? - Fine then, here. - Oh, thank you! - Now bring it back, yeah? I do love peanuts. [laughs] [Joe singing] - Joe Croaker, here you go, take a gander. - [screams] Stinks bad! - Hey there, Joe, thanks for the soap, smells great. - Oh no, Mole Cricket's contaminated it, and it's so small! Now that's better than it was before. Ahh, why is it getting smaller? [sniffs] It does smell good though. [Joe groans] - [Flutterby and Mole Cricket] Can we borrow your soap? - Pretty please. [laughs] - Oh Joe. [laughs] - No way Jose, I'm not lending it again. - [Flutterby and Mole Cricket] Oh, come on. - Later, dudes. - Huh? - I'm out of here. - [Flutterby and Mole Cricket] Oh, the soap! - [Joe] Aloha, bugs. - Joe Croaker. - Oh no, I gotta stop him. [screams] - [laughs] I got rid of them. Huh? [screams] - Oh. - Oh. [laughs] I'm sorry, but finders keepers, yes? - Not fair. - Hmm, that was pretty easy. [laughs] [Flutterby squeals] - Give it. - No way, it's mine. - It's mine. - Give it, you better let go. - Give it here. [Cosmo singing] - Huh? Is that a lover's tiff? [Flutterby and Mole Cricket grunting] [screams] Ow! [groans] - It's my soap! Huh, my poor soap. [Cosmo groans] - [All] Huh? - [hiccups] I've had better. Or have I? [all groan] [Joe Croaker yelps] [Bartle Bee singing] - Huh? [Sparkle grunting] [rock thudding] [Sparkle screams] - Oh, that hurts. [screams] - Oh hey, Sparkle. - Huh? - Hey, Sparkle, are you all right there? - Just look. - [gasps] Oh boy. So, where's your brother, and why are you building a house here all by yourself? [Sparkle grumbles] What's going on with you guys? Come on now, you've got to tell me. - Bartle Bee, look here, help me build my house, come on. - What, Strobe will help you. - That guy's a total loss, sheesh. Bartle Bee, how about it? Look at this hand. - Oh, all righty. - Wow, all right, thank you, Barty! [Bartle Bee grunting] - Now it's all done. - [laughs] Wow, hey that's super, I love it. - Sparkle, Sparkle, where are you? Sparkle? Sparkle? Oh. - Sparkle. - Huh, Bartle Bee. Welcome. I thank you for helping me to build such a fantastic house! Wow, am I ever happy. - Sparkle, you don't look very happy to me. - Hey look, I'm fine, really yeah. - Sparkle, you haven't told me yet why you're striking out on your own. Why don't you want to bunk with your brother anymore? - Hmph, I don't even know that guy. I want it back, come on. - Well, it's right here, come and get it. - I want it back! Huh? Oh no, I can't find it. - Hey, look here. [laughs] It's just a silly marble. - Hmph, well you would say that. That toy was my favorite one. - You're all upset over some glass. Now how smart is that? Ha, fine then. - You're the world's worst brother. - You little runt! - And I never wanna see your face again! - Ha! - Then he just flew away. [cries] Oh yeah, Bart, he was worse than he's ever been. - [Strobe] Sparkle, where are you? - Oh, I guess he's back. Bartle Bee, you've gotta help me. Don't tell him where I've gone, thank you. - Well. - Sparkle! Sparkle, where have you gone? Sparkle. Hiya, oh am I ever glad to see you. For a minute... Oh, I thought you were my brother. Tell me, have you seen Sparkle anywhere? - He may be anywhere. - Thank you anyway, guy. Oh, if you see him around, would you tell him that I'm looking for him? - Sure, I will. - Bye-bye. - See you. Oh hey, Strobe. - Huh? - Maybe he's staying over at a friend's house tonight. How about you call it a day, Strobe? - Will do, Bart. No way, that crazy kid's the only brother that I've got. - If you want me back, well then, maybe I should pack my things and go back tomorrow. But for now I need a pillow. Ah! Look at what I found, this rock will be perfect. [Sparkle grunting] - That's that, he just left. Huh? Hey, Sparkle, leave that rock alone. - Huh? [whimpers] What on earth's happening? Huh? [walls rumble] - [screams] Sparkle, are you okay? Sparkle, come on! - Bartle Bee, help! - [Bartle Bee] Sparkle! - Huh, Sparkle! Hey, Sparkle! - Sparkle. [grunting] Sparkle! - Hey, Bartle Bee. - Huh? - What's wrong? - Come help, there's not much time left. Oh please come here and help me. [Strobe screams] - Don't worry. [grunting] Your brother's coming to get you! [grunting] [Bartle Bee groans] [walls clatter] [Bartle Bee cries] - Oh, this thing is all my doing. I should never have let Sparkle talk me into helping him build his house. [cries] [Strobe grunting] Huh? - You okay, bro? - Oh, oh! Hey, hey, you guys! - Bartle Bee, what are you crying about? [Bartle Bee cries] - Sparkle! - Bartle Bee, you're gonna break me in half. Remember what I've just been through. - And Strobey was injured. - Oh, you're talking about this. [Sparkle cries] It's okay, you got yourself into a very dangerous situation over there. - But that's only because you mistreated me. - Huh? - [Bartle Bee and Sparkle] Huh? Oh? - Look kid, look I found it, I found it! - [Bartle Bee and Sparkle] Oh? - Take it. - What is it? Hey, oh boy, that's great! - Sparkle, forgive me. I really shouldn't have made fun of you. - And I don't know how I could have left our own home. Now that we're all together, let's play then. - Okay, guys, I love a happy ending. So, let's play our game now, okay? - All right. - [Sparkle] But I'm sleepy now. [Cricket singing] - This nectar is so sweet. - That's true. Because we care for our flowers. Yes, they're the best. - Good nectar means top quality honey. [Flutterby laughs] - Hey, you guys! - Huh? - Flutterby. - Huh? Oh no, that annoying cricket is after me again. - Then let's get out of there. - Hey, guys, nice day isn't it? - [Flutterby and Bartle Bee] [laugh] Morning. [Flutterby and Bartle Bee groan] - Hey, Flutterby, did you get my flowers? I called you like 50 times. It's like you don't even like me. [Flutterby and Bartle Bee laugh] - Well, that isn't true. - [Flutterby] Yes, we're always happy to see friendly faces. - Huh, oh yeah! For I second I thought I was coming off as a creepy stalker type. - Of course not. - I wanna enlighten you a bit, do you know I've encountered many scary and dangerous people? - [Flutterby and Bartle Bee] Dangerous people? [scream] - Yeah, that's right, malicious, terrifying. [growls] - Hey, Bartle Bee, isn't it about time we took the honey back to your comb, what do you say? - Ah, that's right, we better get going. - Oh, bye, see you. - Hey, wait for me. - [singing] This smells glorious. - Flutterby. - Huh? - I'm coming, my darling. Bartle Bee, Flutterby? - It's Cricket. [Cosmo gagging] - Hey there. [Cosmo coughs] - Yeah, what are you doing? - My goodness, what is wrong with you? Every time I see you, man, you're just sitting there eating junk food. Hey, Cosmo, you really don't look that good. You're gonna scare the ladies. I'm pretty sure I warned you about this. You need to think about what's that stuff you put in your mouth and what it's gonna do to the rest of your figure. You're gonna end up looking like Joe, you want that? - What are you talking about? - Hey, listen, you oughta eat right so you can have a chiseled bod like I do. Say, you dig it? Hey, Cosmo, but wait. - Would you just leave me alone, you're annoying. - Cosmo, you haven't let me finish yet. - Be quick about it. - Well, you know how vegetables are good for you, right? Take cabbage for example, it tastes great. - Shove your cabbage. - Come on, be a good sport and give it a try. It's rich in minerals and good stuff, and it'll give you a fresh meal every day. - Stop, cabbage are you serious? Enough, I don't give a darn about cabbage! - Oh. Oh, your poor tummy. [Cosmo grumbles] And don't get me started on what it does to you downstairs. - [huffs] If you shut up for a day, I'll give you all the best food I have. - Really? - Really. - Hi. - Also, he'll be your slave for a day, okay? - Great, deal, from now on I won't say a single word. - Really? - Yeah. - So then she was like, "No way." And I was like, "Well, that's the way it is." - Uh-huh, and then what happened? - Huh? - Huh, what's going on? - It's him again. - Hi, oh! - Skedaddle before he gets started. - It's all good, I heard that him and Cosmo have a bet. Yep, he has to keep silent, and if he talks he loses. - Huh, seriously? - Yes. - I highly doubt he can keep his mouth shut for a whole day. - Oh yes, I totally agree, this'll be fun. - Aww. - Hey, McBroom, pretend I just told you a hilarious joke. [Cosmo and McBroom laugh] - Uh. - Huh, what was that? - Um. [grumbles] - Ah, silence is golden. [laughs] McBroom, wouldn't you agree with that? - Aye. [Cricket grumbles] - Oh hey, McBroom, you must be hungry. Come on, dig into this, okay? - All right. - Cricket, indulge yourself. Fancy a piece of this? It's good. If you want a bite, speak. [Cricket grumbles] [laughs] This is way too much fun. [Cosmo and McBroom yelp] [rocks clanking] [Cricket grunting] [grumbles] Irritating! - You cut that out. [rocks clanking] - Put those annoying rocks down! [rocks clanking] [Cosmo and McBroom grumbling] I'd rather hear his voice than those stinking rocks. - But then you'll lose all your tasty food. - That's right, I almost forgot. And you will have to be his slave. - I guess that is a bit worse. - That's right, one whole day, think about it. Think about how many dung balls you'll be missing out on if you're a slave. We ain't got all day, make him talk, it's all on you. - Hey. Hey, Cricket, you better start talking or I'm gonna... I'll... - Put a dung ball in your mouth. - Right right right. - Open your mouth and start talking, buddy! [Cosmo grunting] Finito. - Cosmo. - Huh? - I got the good. - Perfect. [Cosmo and McBroom laugh] They're the exact size of the pit. Now he's gonna have to talk. Huh? [Cricket singing] Let's go hide somewhere quick! [Cricket singing] - Huh? [screams] - Hey. [laughs] - Mission success. Huh? - Cricket. - Cricket. [Cricket groaning] Cricket. - Huh, huh? - Cricket, I'm guessing you'll need a little helping hand. [Cricket moaning] Well, ask then, let me hear you shout it out loud and clear for us. [Cricket laughs] Oh, but I still can't hear you. Come on, Cricket, as loud as you can. - [Cricket Voiceover] Hmph, how stupid does he think I am? - Cosmo, look there, the sun is going down. - Huh? - We're running out of time. I'm going to be a slave soon. - Not a chance. There must be a way to get him to speak. That's it. McBroom. - Huh? - Hey, let me tell you a real joke. You ready? Why do seagulls fly over the sea? This is a really funny one, come on, why? - Seagulls? - Because if it was the bay, they'd be called be called bay gulls, right? - [Cosmo and McBroom] [laugh] Yeah, we won the game! [Cricket grumbles] [Cosmo and McBroom laugh] - Who's a wee loser, huh? - You are! - [screams] I knew it was some kind of setup. I should've kept my mouth shut, right? I was this close to paradise, you. You would've scrubbed every inch of my house. I was this close, it's not fair. [all screaming] - Oh please, for it is to laugh, you got nothing on me. - Oh, oh, that's awfully high. - High, it ain't high for me. Check out these legs and the gun show. I'm the stuff that dreams are made of. You admiring, you jelly? [laughs] Look here, short stack. Now check the premise out, okay? We race, you lose, I win. - How dare you talk to me that way. [Locust laughs] Locust, you schmuck! - What, you really wanna mix it up, huh? [Sow Bug groans] - Yeah, that's right, I'm calling you out right now. I'll show you. - Contest, why do you want to have a contest? - [laughs] I know, it's like the guy has a death wish or something, right? Well, I will indulge him. - Bartle Bee, how about being the referee? I wanna show little stick legs here pill bugs are tough as nails. - Hmph. - Okay. Hey, let's start now. Whoever is the first to jump over these hurdles and get to the finish line, that's our winner. Right, so we're all clear, then let's begin. Gentlemen, on your marks. - I'll show that loser. - Right, not on this planet, you little squirt. This is what I do best, and I brought some insurance. - Ready, go! - It looks like the sow bug and the locust are pretty well matched here in the early stages. They've made it over the first hurdle, and now they've just cleared the second. The third seemed a breeze. And now they're going for the fourth. Hey, I'll follow them. [Locust panting] They cleared another hurdle. [Sow Bug screams] [Locust laughs] [Sow Bug groans] - Just what's going on? Huh? - My work is finished here, so now I'll go. Wow, I really earned those peanuts Locust gave me. - Locust, hmph! - What's taking Sow Bug so long? Hey, you made it! - Bartle Bee, he cheated, Walking Stick helped him out. That's sabotage! - Huh? - [laughs] No one said I couldn't have a friend come and help me out, right? And the point is I won, deal with it, nerd. - Oh. [Bartle Bee groans] - Now let's get started, this is round two. And look, hey you, quit cheating, all right? [Locust grumbles] Now what have next is the hill climb. Clear that hill. Ready, set, go! [Locust panting] [Sow Bug groaning] [Locust laughs] - [laughs] Hey, Pill Bug. Enjoy the sweet taste of my victory. [laughs] - I'm gonna make it. [Sow Bug groans] - Huh? [Sow Bug groans] [Locust screams] [Locust panting] - Hey! [Sow Bug groans] [Locust groans] The winner, that's you! [Sow Bug laughs] - Huh? Ah shoot. - So, we've arrived at the last round and that is the thicket of thorns. All right, there's just one thing though. No flying, okay? - Huh? - All right, go! [Locust panting] [Sow Bug groaning] - No flying, huh, then I'll jump. - Huh? [Locust screams] [loud thudding] [Locust groaning] - Huh? [grumbles] Ow! [Sow Bug groans] I can't let him win. [Locust groaning] [Locust screams] Okay, at this rate I'll never catch up to him. But now the judge ain't here. [laughs] Ah, that's the ticket. [laughs] You silly old pill bug, go ahead and eat my dust. Huh? [Locust screams] [Locust groans] [screams] Somebody get me out of here! [bird coos] - Huh? [Locust groans] Somebody get me out of here! - [groans] Now I can take a break. - Pill Bug, get me out of here, it's a bird! - What? [Locust cries] - Somebody! - Oh, gee, I gotta get him out. [yelps] - Please, Mr. Bird, I'm not that tasty. [groans] Pill Bug, you came just for me? - Yeah, I'm on it, now don't move. [Locust groans] No, he's coming back. Hurry up, hurry up! [Sow Bug and Locust groan] [Sow Bug and Locust laugh] - Oh? Locust. - Huh? - This is your fault, you. - Bartle Bee, okay, I lost fair and square. And the winner is that guy. - Me? - Oh yeah, I'd be lost without you. [all laugh] - [Locust] No, seriously, I won. [Joe yawns] - It's so hot, the sun's really scorching. And my mouth is dry and my throat is burning. I need to drink some water. Oh wowee, orange! This is just terrific! Mmm, I love you, and now I'm gonna eat you. I love you, orange. Huh, come back! Oh please, come back, oh orange. Oh, what's this, one little piece left. It's better than nothing. Such a tiny piece of orange. [Joe groans] Please somebody get me out of here! [cries] - Oh, I'm exhausted, it's break time. [Bartle Bee snores] - [groans] I need to get back on my feet. I need air. Oh, honey! [Bartle Bee snores] I love honey. [laughs] [Joe groans] - Huh? Maybe I'm just dreaming. [snores] - Oh, I love honey, yeah! [hiccups] I'm so full. This orange peel's turned out to be useful. I even outsmarted that busybody honey-making Bartle Bee. I better make full use of it. - 1, 2. [grunts] I'm tired. Wait, I've only got these few left, and then I'm done for the day. 1, 2, 3, 4. [McBroom grunting] [Joe laughs] Oh no. [Joe laughs] [McBroom grunting] Finally rolled all of my dung balls up the hill. Huh? What happened to my dung balls? - Red, yellow, and purple. I really enjoy categorizing flower petals in the morning. [laughs] Monday, I'll put the green petals in my bath. On Tuesday, I'll use the purple ones. On Wednesday, yellow and on Thursday, red. Huh, just look at all of them, come on. [singing] Oh right, I need to go get a bottle. - A pretty pile of petals to play in. [grunting] [Flutterby singing] [Joe grunting] [Flutterby singing] - [laughs] Huh? Oh no, my petals! It took me half and hour to sort them! What's going on here? - [laughs] This is totally cool. [Cosmo grunting] Huh? - Oh, it's heavy. - Ooh, Cosmo's got some chocolate over there. I told him to share everything tasty with me! He should not have ignored me. [Cosmo grunting] - Huh? Who's there? Probably just the wind or something. - [laughs] Chocolate. - Well, it's time to take this to my can house. Huh, my chocolate, there's a piece missing! Hmm, I must've lost it when I was dragging it. Oh well, just get home. [sighs] I should be more careful. [Joe laughs] I'm exhausted, I'll take a break. Huh, what was that? Ahh, another piece of chocolate's missing! Hmm? [Cosmo growls] A little detective work will solve this case. Hmm? [Joe laughs] Huh, what's going on here? That's weird, it came from over here. [gasps] The chocolate, it's gone! Oh, this is crazy, come out, thief! You come out here right now! You took all my chocolate, and you're gonna pay! [Joe hiccups] Huh, was that a hiccup? Oh, it's Joe Croaker down there. - [Cosmo Voiceover] So, he's the one that's behind this. Oh well then, all my chocolate's gone. I'll go back home and grab my secret stash. [laughs] - [laughs] What a silly fly. - [laughs] Peanut. And a beverage. [Joe gagging] - [laughs] What a fool. Now it's time to make my special mud-filled drink. [Joe gagging] - Give me a drink! [Cosmo laughs] - You deserve it, Joe Croaker, it serves you right. Joe, did you really think you could trick me with a plain old orange peel? How'd you like your rock peanut or your muddy beverage? - You're the one behind all this, fly? [screams] - You come back here, fly. - Course it was me. [laughs] [light music] [Cosmo groans] You'll never catch me. - Cosmo, get back here. [Joe groans] - [laughs] Joe, you're just a big meany. - Cosmo, this isn't over yet. Oh? Ah, my favorite! Yes, peach is the best flavor ever. [laughs] - Yoink! - Huh? - [laughs] Joe Croaker, you don't mind if I take this away from you, do you? After all, you gotta learn to share. - Yeah well, the boogeyman's behind you. He looks pretty bad too. - Oh really? Do you really think I'd fall for that? Your days of tricking me are over. - Oh, Cosmo, leave my candy alone. Now you've done it! Frog tongue! [Cosmo screams] [Cosmo laughs] What are you doing? - I'm leaving your candy alone, right here on this rock. [laughs] See you! - Hey, you get back here, you stinking fly. [screams] You come back here! [Joe groans] I won't have any problem getting that candy down. [Joe screams] [Joe groans] Why you! [grunting] [Joe groaning] I'm a genius, this should do the trick. Okay now. [groaning] That does it, I'll get you! [Joe groaning] [Joe screams] [Joe groaning] It just might work. [Joe grunting] [coughs] I'll never give up. Oh. Right, the most painful thing in the world is having a snack and not being able to take a bite. Well, I guess I'll just keep trying. Where is that bamboo? Oh my, that's it. - Hey, Joe? - Huh? - Joe Croaker? - Huh? - Joe, over here. - Huh? - So Joe, listen man, what are you taking me to the movies? - [screams] This stick's talking to me. [screams] - What are you doing? - It's a talking stick! [screams] Monster, monster! [screams] [laughs] Oh, hi. - Why did you need me? - Well, I am looking for some... Oh, that's right, pole vaulting. - Pole vaulting, you? - Right. Ooh look, Cosmo put my candy up there. And I'm pole vaulting to get it. - Oh, I see here, pole vaulting. Frankly, Joe, I don't think you can do it. - My word, is that a challenge, twig man? All I need is guidance, yeah. - Well well, you've come to the right place. I can help you. - Really, that's just so awesomely nice of you, twiggy man. - Okay first, I need to get you a good pole. Wait right here. - Okay. - Just make sure you get a really firm grip on it, and then hang on for dear life. Do you understand? - Okay. Can I jump now? - Back up, okay, back up. Croaker, you gotta run up. - Is this far enough back? - Joe Croaker, hold your tailpipes. Now, if you don't wanna die, I have to do some calculations first. - Huh? - Well, I think it'll do. And with the Moon in the second house and Jupiter aligned with Mars, well... Since peace will rule the planets, I guess in the end you should stop about here. Stop at this point before you jump, all right? - Okay. [laughs] Right! [Joe screams] [laughs] Hey look, sticky dude, I'm here! I made it, I made it, I made it! - We did it, awesome! I'll see you later, gotta go. - Catch you later, and thank you so much, sticky. [laughs] He's such a nice insect. Now for you, yeah. [laughs] ( Here I come. Huh, no don't leave! [screams] You've got to be kidding me. That's far down. [Cosmo singing] - Hey, Cosmo! - Huh? - I dropped my candy down there, can you get it for me? - You want me to pick up your candy. First you yell at me for placing it on the rock, and now you want me to put it back up there? Huh, why don't you go get it yourself? - Cosmo, I wouldn't ask if I could get down from here. - [blubbers] Ain't my concern, see you! - Come back, come back, come back, Cosmo, come back, hey! [sighs] It is a pretty view from up here though. - Yummy food, yummy food. [grunting] It's so heavy! [grunting] Finally, I bet there's something tasty inside. Huh? It's completely empty. Why is it so hard to get a decent meal around this dump? Huh? - I'm not the young dung roller that I used to be. Boy, I'm pooped, time for a wee nap. And dream of days of old when dung was plentiful, flowing like lava from the back of every cow hide. Good times. - Hey there, lazy. - Huh? - I couldn't help but notice you napping on the job, which is frustrating because I work so hard and have no food to show for it. - It's the same for me, I've been working around the clock, and I barely have enough dung to last a fortnight. - Huh, don't try and fool me, McBroom. I work much harder than you, and I don't even know how long a fortnight is. But I know it means you have more food than me, and I'm a growing flyling who needs nutrition. - Cosmo, there's no way you can work harder than me. - [Cosmo] Scavenging is as tough as it gets. - What are they doing over there? - [Cosmo] That's not true. - You have no idea what you're talking about. - Stop, stop fighting. - I work 24/7. - So do I. - 24/8. - Come on, guys. - That makes no sense. - You don't make sense. How dare you. - How dare you. - [Bartle Bee] What is going on with you guys? - Hey, Bartle Bee, you tell us. Which one of us is the harder worker, that dung pusher or me? Huh, tell us! - Well, Cosmo is, but then again actually I work harder than the both of you. - [Cosmo and McBroom] Huh? - Collecting nectar is the toughest job in the marsh. I mean I'm up at the flower patches before you two even roll out of bed. Haven't you heard of the term busy as a bee? - Utter nonsense. - Huh, Flutterby? - Huh, you are all a bunch of lazy slouches. Compared to pollinating flowers, you guys are just part-time. Isn't that right, Bartle Bee? - Well. [groans] - Hey, stop arguing, I dig tunnels every day. A job too tough for you all. - Flies are the hardest workers. - Dung beetles are. - You both mean butterflies! - Enough! Hey, we can't settle anything by arguing. Let me see, why don't we trade jobs? - [All] Huh, trade jobs? - That's right, that way we can experience each other's jobs firsthand. We can draw straws. It's the only way we'll be able to tell whose job is harder. Trust me on this one, guys. - Yeah! - Yeah. - All right, so I've written everyone's jobs on these straws, so let's take turns drawing them. Who will be first? - [All] Hmm. - Me! - Okay. - This one. - Great, congrats, and your job will be rolling dung balls. - What, I don't want to roll dung balls! The smell alone makes my wings wilt, it's disgusting. - [Bartle Bee] Okay, next one. - It's my turn, me. - Here you go. - This one. I guess this means digging? - Okay now, next one please. - Huh? - McBroom will collect nectar. Mole Cricket will gather pollen. That leaves me to scavenge. - Hey, Bartle Bee, when does this contest start? - [laughs] So, now that we've all got our new jobs, I say we start right away. [laughs] - [whimpers] Ew! [whimpers] Oh my, drawing jobs was a lousy idea. It's all Bartle Bee's fault. And just look at the state of my hands. [screams] Oh, it's so disgusting! [panting] But I've got to roll as many of these dung balls as I can. There's no way I'm losing this one, hmph. [grunting] Come on, come on. [Flutterby grunting] That really hurt me. Huh? [screams] [Cosmo grunting] - Digging tunnels is tiring. I've been digging all morning and this is it? Oh man. Oh, a spoon. This spoon really came in handy. [Cosmo grunting] [laughs] Digging ain't so bad just as long as you use your mind and not your... [groans] - There are so many flowers. Huh, so which one of them has the nectar deep within? Well now, that's a pretty shade of brown. Reminds me of my very first dung ball, that's the one. All right, time to collect some nectar, easy as pie. All right, all right, all right, all right. Oh, keep your balance, McBroom. Whoa! [groans] I should leave collecting nectar for the bees. - Well, at least you can fly. I have to climb my way to the top of the flower. This is gonna take forever. Oh, better get started. [groans] I can't let go of it, I'm losing my grip. Whoa! Whoa! - Junk, junk, all there is is junk. Ugh, there's nothing edible here for a bee. Scavenging is much more difficult than I thought it would be. Ugh, I can't eat anything that I've found. Candy and cheese not for me. - Bartle Bee! - Huh? - [All] This contest is over. [sighing] - Oh, Cosmo, it's about time. I don't know how you do it, buddy. Scavenging drove me crazy! - Oh yeah, digging tunnels is practically torture! - Nonsense, rolling dung balls is absolutely positively repulsive. - Oh no no, I'd like that stricken from the record. - Don't think so, gathering pollen is hard. - [McBroom] Gathering dung is even harder. - They're the same thing. - Look at my poor hands! - [McBroom] Cosmo, you've barely worked a day in your life. - No, me! - I'm the hardest worker. [all cross-talking] [Joe groans] - I sure am bored. [Bartle Bee singing] - Huh? Bartle Bee! - Huh? - Hey, Bartle Bee, hey you look happy. - I just found the most aromatic flower. - Aromatic flower? - I've never seen such a flower. - Hey, Bartle Bee, you've gotta show me that flower, yeah? - Look, isn't it just the prettiest flower you've ever seen in your life? [sniffs] Oh, and it smells fantastical. [Joe sniffs] So, what do you think of it, Joe? - I'm in love with it. Right. [grunting] - Joe Croaker, what are you doing? - I'm gonna take it home with me, Bartle, to mask Cosmo's smelly cheeses. - If you do that then you might kill it, so please leave it alone. - Oh, everything dies, Bartle. It's relative, you should know that, you nosy bee. - Huh, hmph. [Joe grunting] Joe Croaker, leave that flower alone. - Buzz off, you. [Bartle Bee groans] - You'll regret this. [Joe grunting] - I say the smell of flowers can help one's sleeping ability. I feel a bit itchy, I should've had that shower this week. [laughs] Perfect. [sniffs] That's delicious, it's the perfect addition. [Joe groaning] Achoo, achoo, achoo! I should've brought a tissue. What's going on? - [laughs] I hit the jackpot today, I love cheese. - Cosmo, Cosmo! Hey, Cosmo! [Joe groaning] - What's up with you? [laughs] Hey, Joe, you look like a children's connect the dots book. - Huh? Achoo, achoo! I don't why. I saw this flower, and I've been feeling sick ever since. Hey there, you gotta help me, this itch is driving me crazy. [Cosmo chomps] - Don't worry, I'll check you out. Hmm. - Huh? - Ah, I've got it! Cosmo thinks you're allergic to pollen. So, the cure is to expose you to even more pollen. It's called fighting fire with fire. The more you sniff, the better you'll feel. - Huh? - Absolutely, trust me, why not? - [sniffs] The more I sniff, the better I feel. - [Joe Voiceover] You know I feel better already. Give me more, I want more! [Joe screams] [Cosmo screams] - Why is it getting worse? Cosmo, I'm itching all over now. - Did you sniff, did you sniff as much as possible? - Of course, I did what you told me to do. - Oh no, that's strange, huh? Maybe Grandma Niddy can help. - What are you waiting for? - I'll be right back. - [groans] Cosmo, hurry up, come on. - Hey, Joe. Why are you sneaking around? - 'Cause this is a secret operation, Cosmo. Didn't you know? - Secret? - Grandma Niddy said the only cure for my allergy is honey. So, I need to steal some from Bart. - I'll just go ask Bartle Bee. - How many times do I have to tell you. I took that flower from Bartle Bee, he's not gonna help me. - True. - So, now he's out getting nectar. You go in there and get the honey for me. - But he'll be mad if I, well, you know. - That's why I'm on lookout duty! - Okay. - If Bartle Bee comes over, I'll cough two times. You grab the honey and fly away. - Okay. - Whoa, it's itchy. I gotta scratch! [groans] [twinkling music] - Wow, so much honey. Oh wow! Let's go. [grunting] [Cosmo groaning] - That fly is really slow, he should've been back by now. Huh? [Joe gasps] [Joe coughs] - Did someone call me? Never mind. [grunts] That'll do. [Bartle Bee singing] - Cosmo! - Oh? - The last one. [grunting] - Huh? How dare you! Stop it! - Well... Bartle Bee. [Cosmo screams] - Cosmo. [Cosmo groans] Are you all right there, little buddy? Huh? - Oh my gosh, what happened to you? - I... - [laughs] So, that's the story, huh? If you needed my honey so badly, you could've asked. Come on, this way. - Really? Bartle Bee, I'm really sorry that I took your flower. - It's okay, come on, follow me. - Okay. [laughs] [Cosmo laughs] - Yeah, you look better now, have one more. - Yum yum, oh this is aces. [Cosmo and Bartle Bee laugh] - Guess it worked. Congratulations, you're back to your old self. [all laughing] - I feel all right now, this is amazing! Oh yeah. I'm so happy, I don't itch anymore. This is really wonderful, oh yeah! [Cosmo coughing] No more itching! - Huh, Cosmo? - Huh? - Something's wrong, achoo! I think I'm allergic to honey! Achoo, achoo! [groans] [chomping] Delicious, epitome of awesome! [Cosmo coughs] - Cosmo, are you being a sneaky fly? - Hmm? Hey, Flutterby, can I help you? - Actually, Cosmo, you know what? It was my birthday two days ago. - [laughs] Well, happy belated birthday. - I was expecting something more. Usually my friends all bring me presents. - Presents? Well, I'm sorry I didn't get you one, but that doesn't mean that I won't. In fact, my girl, sit tight in your little flower house, and I'll bring you one real soon. - Really, that's so sweet! Cosmo, see you around, yes? - Perfect present, where are you? Oh, this ain't good enough, this one might be good. She'll surely like this one. Well, she better. Flutterby, are you inside? I come bearing gifts. - Huh, a gift, here I am. So, Cosmo, what sparkly gift have you got for me? - Ta-da, happy birthday! - [screams] What is that thing, it looks filthy. - Huh, filthy? Looks like sparkles to me. Flutterby, I personally went through the dumpster and chose this just for you. The holes remind me of the spots in your wings. - I'm sorry, I'd really rather not. Just imagine all the germs living on that thing, and I don't want to catch them. - Hmm, yeah, I get you. - Oh? - Hey, Flutterby, give me a moment. I can do better. Honey breath, I'm back. Here. - [screams] What is that thing? Get it out of my sight right now! [Cosmo sighs] [light music] - [sighs] Ladies are sure hard to impress. I never knew it would be so difficult to please her. Huh, a flower? Wow, gorgeous, she'll love it! [Flutterby singing] - Oh wow, still no wrinkles, yay! - Flutterby! - Huh? - Hey, Flutterby, come on look what I've got for you. - Wow. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. - What do you think, cool, huh? - Wow, there are so many colors. Cosmo, where did you get this multicolored flower from, hey? - Where you ask? I searched high and low all over the marsh to come across this beauty. Here, specially for you. - It's really very pretty, but it has no scent. - Huh, no scent? Hey, that's easy, I know just the way to make it smell absolutely amazing and delicious. [laughs] Well, that was a lie. Why do I make empty promises? [McBroom grunting] Huh? [McBroom humming] McBroom, he'll know what to do. McBroom? - Huh? Hey. - McBroom. I ask you what smells good? - What smells good? Hey, I bet it's the sweet aroma of this wonderful dung ball here, great aroma. - [sniffs] Well, it does smell really fresh. Would you do me a favor, McBroom? - What's that? - Can you keep this in your house for the night? - Ah, you betcha, all right. - Flutterby, your birthday flower has its own smell now. Come and get a whiff. - Wow, that's terrific. What the? Oh, it's vulgar, it stinks! What kind of scent is that? - Well, it's dung ball scent of course. Both me and McBroom love it. Give it another sniff, come on, Flutterby. - No, get that gross smell away from me! - Come on! Oh, personally I think it's pretty neat to have a dung-scented flower. Way cooler than those boring old flowers that smell like flowers. Ugh, and the pollen! Yeah, pollen gives off a sweet smell. So, if I just put pollen on the flower, it'll smell sweet like me. She loves me, she loves me not, achoo! She loves, achoo! Flutterby, look. - Oh, it smell amazing. This is the best flower that my nose has ever had the pleasure of sniffing. [laughs] How can I thank you? [laughs] - Hang on, achoo! [light music] - Wow, how beautiful. - Wow, that's gorgeous. - [Sparkle] Gee, Flutterby, this is the most beautiful flower I've ever seen. - [laughs] Wunderbar! [all laugh] - Wow. - Cosmo, you must come and join us. - Huh, oh yeah! [all laugh] - Whoa, hey, what are you guys up to? - Hey, Bartle Bee. [all groan] - Hey, watch it! - Oh? - Ta-da! - Amazing! - [laughs] It's a birthday gift, isn't it beautiful? Oh yes yes, feel free to gather some nectar from it any time. - Good idea. [sniffs] This flower... - Huh? - What's wrong? - Well, it's actually a fake, so there's no nectar. Well, my job's done for the day. - It's fake, what do you mean? - [All] Huh? - This. Huh? Bartle was right. You! Why would you give me a fake one? - How was I supposed to know it's fake? - Hmph, I don't want your rotten gift! Cosmo, I need some time to be alone now, hmph. - Oh, I sure am sorry, Flutter. [groans] - [Sparkle and Strobe] Huh? - Oh, a bean. Cosmo. - Huh? - What you got, it looks pretty. - Oh, it was Flutterby's gift. That was until she discovered it was just a fake. Then she dumped me. Oh, I give up on love. - Wow, it's so cute. If she didn't want it could I have it, pal? - [laughs] Sure, it's covered in pollen, and pollen makes me itchy, so you can keep it. - Thanks. - Ciao for now. - Ah, I've been looking for a way to keep that butterfly from hassling me.
