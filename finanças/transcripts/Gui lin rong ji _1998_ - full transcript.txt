I think, he's got... at least $100,000 in his pocket So, he can afford to get a wife Of course What? You want to marry him? What are you talking about? So why are you so eager to know about him? I know, you wanna have a young husband I think you are the one who wants him You always talk about him everyday You even know how much money he has Shut up. That's enough I shouldn't have introduced him to board at your restaurant That's why people say...
