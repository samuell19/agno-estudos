Honey, why don't you make us some coffee? Yeah? I will be right there. I will be right there. I will be right there. Jamie, you be careful. Jamie, you be careful. You be careful. Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? How you doin'? That's fine. I'll take a cab. Okay. Okay, then. I'll see you later. Okay, then. Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? How you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. What did you do? What did you do? Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. What did you do? Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. What did you do? What did you do? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. What did you do? Dinner's ready, honey. Mom. You hear me, honey? I will be right there. - Hello, Bart. - Hey, how you doin'? Well, I'm fine. How are you doin'? Well, that's a very complicated question. - Right. - Could take a while to answer. Yeah, let it go. Yeah, good choice. Well, you take it easy. It should be pretty quiet. We're pretty empty. But things are improving. - Are they? - Yes. The summer travel season's here. Wow. That's certainly good news, Bart. - Yes, it is. - I'll see you tomorrow. - You have a good night. - You have a good night. Hello? - Boo! How you doin'? - Oh, my God! You scared me. What were you doing under the... Oh, there was a connection that I... I wasn't expecting... It's very late. Yes. Is that a problem? Oh, no, no. So, can I help you? Um, yeah, thanks. You have a reservation for, uh, Perretti? I think that's the name it's under. Yes. King suite, non-smoking, garden view. One night, $219 with tax. Yeah. That sounds right. Is it a nice room? "The king suite is a modern, light, and spacious room with a view of the green surroundings and a luxurious rain shower. Read more. This four-star room is characterized by its modern and spacious feel. An eye for design goes hand-in-hand with its light and bright elegant effect. Air conditioning, a safe, telephone, a flat screen TV, and wireless Internet connection are provided as standard in the room. Read less." Well, sounds perfect. Thank you. Room 109. One key or two? One. Uh, two. Thanks. - Wait. Uh, wrong room. - What? Room 124. Nicer. French doors provide access to the pool area. Swell. Straight down the hall to the right. Checkout is at noon, so... Thank you. You be careful. - Surprise. - Jesu. You are surprised, aren't you? A little disappointed, I would imagine. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? You left your cell phone. That isn't mine. Yes, it is. Your other phone. - Don't lie. It's insulting. - Hey, Bart. What is that? Porn? No. No, no, no. Just... Looked like one of our rooms. They shooting porn here now? No. - You're early. - Yeah. You can take off if you want. How are you, Bart? That's a very complicated question, and it could take me a long... Take a long time to answer, right. So unless you really wanna know... Yeah, forget it. I'll see you around. Yes, okay, then. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. That's what I said. Yeah. Go on, get out of here. See you tomorrow. That shirt is really annoying. The colors are very bright, and the stripes are making me really dizzy. So... Okay, well... fuck you. Thank you. I sent her a text from you. She isn't coming. - She isn't? - No. Told her you couldn't make it. Had to cancel. This is our date. This is our date. We could pretend that... that you love me. That I love you too. Okay. We're not in love. We could pretend like I'm just some... easy piece of ass that you meet in a hotel. Regularly. Secretly. A fuck buddy, whatever they call it. - Is that what she is? - Shut up! Shut up. Mercer Hotel. Can I help you? Hello? Hello? Uh, uh... I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Come on. come on. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Bart! I think this person might be dead. Jesus. All right. All right, uh... Don't touch anything. I'll call 911. Bart was a good candidate for the job. The company has a policy of hiring, well, whenever they can. He's not Mr. Personality, okay? I mean, he has kind of an odd way about him, you know, with people, but... So how long has he been here? Uh, two, three years. Almost three now. Any trouble? No, no, he's very smart and very capable. Thanks. You're welcome. I forgot my wallet. Excuse me? I finished my shift. It was 4:00 a.m. Well, actually around 3:45 a.m. because Jack was early. My shift is eight to four. Jack is my relief. But this morning he was early. I don't really know why. You'd have to ask him about that because I didn't ask him, so I don't really know the reason why he was early, but he was. And so I left 15 minutes before my shift was over, and I drove home by way of Reynolds Boulevard and Arena Drive, and I took a right on Eighth Avenue and then a left on Jay Street to number 433, which is where I live. Bart, right? Bart? And I stopped and got some ice cream on the way home. And when I got there, I ate the ice cream, and I watched... I watched... I watched TV. And I realized I didn't have my wallet, that I must have left it here at the hotel, so I had to come back and get my wallet because a wallet is a very important thing that you should never lose or leave or forget. - Wow. - Yeah. So I did. So did you find it? Near the vending machines, right where I left it. Such a terrible thing, huh? This is a terrible thing. - How old are you? - 23. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No. Ever had a girlfriend? No. Boyfriend? No. Do you think about sex? That is also a very complicated question. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know, believe me. And it could take me a long time to answer it, but in case you are inquiring for your own personal reasons, you should know that I am not interested. In what? In any sexual activities that involve older men like you. Got it, got it. What about older women? Does that get you going, huh? Okay so, um... so you went home, and you came back for the wallet. That's the story? Yes. Well, your coworker says that he never saw you leave. - Jack? - Yeah. As a matter of fact, he even said your car was still in the parking lot before he heard the gunshot, and that it's possible that you never left. I went home early, around 3:45 a.m., and then I came back through the side entrance. But why, Bart, why? Why not just come in through the front door? Because the side entrance is closer to the vending machines. Okay. Okay, I buy that. Hey, Bart, you know you got blood on your hands, right? Yes, I was interested in the blood, so I touched it. Her blood? The blood is interesting to you? Yes. Look, I know you got issues. Yes. Yes, I do. I know you do, I know it, and it's called... Asperger's. I'm an Aspie. That's a psychological condition that is normally or abnormally characterized by abnormalities of social communication and interaction. An Aspie tends to approach others awkwardly and may engage in frequent one-sided long-winded speeches, such as this one, about a specific topic, while misunderstanding and not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions. - Hey, Bart. - ...thinks the person will stop talking. Bart. Bart, please. Can you just take a breath? - Can you take a breath for me? - And then... Bart, you're a very smart guy, and yet what you're saying to me doesn't make sense. Why not? Why not? Because... Because why would you leave your wallet near the vending machine, and if you didn't have your wallet, how did you pay for the ice cream? I'm gonna need you to come down and identify your wife. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's routine. But, you know, it's important. Maybe it's not her. No, no, no, no, look. I don't... I don't wanna give you any false hope. It is her. It's your wife. Okay. And, uh... And then I'm gonna have to ask you some questions. That kid... Does he know something? Well, you know, it's... She owned a gun. Karen owned a gun. A handgun for protection. The hell is she doing at a hotel in the middle of the night? The next time you speak with him, it will be with a lawyer. All right? You understand? Ma'am, we just asked him a few questions. No, no, no. You don't ask him anything! You cannot keep him here, and you cannot bother him with questions because this is a fragile boy, and you need to understand that and respect that. Ma'am, look, we do understand that, - but you need to... - No, no, no. No buts. You stay away from my boy! Honey? You know you can tell me anything, honey. You can tell me anything in the world, and I will always be on your side. I love you. Okay, we're not in lov. We could pretend like I'm just some... easy piece of ass that you meet in a hotel. Regularly. Secretly. A fuck buddy, whatever they call it. - Is that what she is? - Shut up! Shut up. - The rough stuff, huh? - Is that what you wan? Is that what she liked? Did she like it rough? Shut up! Look, I don't wanna let you go. You know, fire you. That wouldn't be right. So I think moving you to a different location... Okay. It's a similar layout, a little smaller. Not so busy. Same shift for you. Um, same routine. Pretty much same everything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Three, two, one. There you are. Hi. Hey, how you doin'? I'm good. Uh, checking in. Yes. Can I have your name, please? Rivera. Andrea Rivera. Thank you. You're new here, right? Have you stayed with us before, Miss Rivera? Yeah. So what's your name? - My name? - Yeah. Oh. Bartholomew Bromley. My name is Bart. Well, it's very nice meeting you, Bart. What? It's nice to meet you. Oh. Yes, it is. So, room 107. Just down towards the elevators. Turn left, and it's the seventh door on your right. Yeah, I'll find it. Thanks. - Hi. - Hey, how you doin'? - Good. Just checking i. - Yes. Can I have your name? Uh, can I have your name? Rivera. Andrea Rivera. Andrea? That's a very nice name. I don't think I've ever met an Andrea. Seven nights? Yeah, a week, maybe longer. I'm not sure yet. Well, that's great. The room's available, and you can stay as long as you like, and we'd love to have you here. So you're new here, right? Yes, I am. Well, I was working at the Mercer location, which is also part of the Suites hotel chain. And I transferred to Hamelton last week. And I work the night shift, 8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. And I'm usually here alone, unless we have a large party checking in. In that case, we put on an extra person to help out. But usually it's just me here, so unless... Well, if you need anything... So, if you need anything... anything... Talk too much. Never mind. So you're new here, right? Yes, I am. And if there's anything I can help you out with, please let me know. See? That's it. That's all you have to say. That's better, see? So now you say... Right. Would you like one key or two? Just one. Okay, perfect. It's room 107. Would you like me to show you where that is? I'll find it. Thanks, Bart. Andrea. Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, Andrea. Dinner's ready, honey. I made rice and beans. Shredded pork. Very tasty. Hey. Hi. How you doin'? Good. I'm just picking up some things for the room. - Coffee and milk... - Coffee's supplied free of charge in the queen suites, as well as sweeteners and nondairy creamer. Yeah. But it's not the best coffee, is it? And God knows what's in those nondairy things. Vegetable fats replicate the feel of milk fats. Other common ingredients include corn syrup, sweeteners, flavorings such as French vanilla and hazelnut, and sodium caseinate, a milk protein that is derivative from casein that does not contain lactose. Well, now I know. Yes. I talk too much. No, you don't. And then I don't talk. Hey, it's okay, really. I'm socially awkward. Yes, you are. My brother had it. Yeah, only his was worse. He couldn't really function at all. He couldn't hold a job. Nothing. You do pretty well. I have to practice. I have to prepare what to say, how to behave. I watch people, and I imitate. - You watch people? - Yes. Well, I study them. Yeah, well, I guess you have a lot of people to watch. - At the hotel. - Yes. Because otherwise I just feel like I don't belong. Yeah, I know what you mean. He had it? You said your brother, he had it? What happened to him? Um... He was institutionalized for a long time. I used to visit him. And every time he would beg me to get him out of there. But we just couldn't. And then he passed away. Yes. People die. And that's the end. So... Yeah. Okay, bye. Bye. I sent her a text from you. She isn't coming. - She isn't? - No. Told her you couldn't make it. Had to cancel like that. So guess you'll have to settle for me. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three. Is this anything? What does this mean? That there was a camera in the room? Look, I can't even tell if it's her. Okay. It's okay. Look, turn it off, please. It's that kid. It's that kid, isn't it? Possibly. You know, he's very savvy with this technological shit. You know, and these kids, these kids on the spectrum, you know, they could also be very violent. What are you waiting for? Arrest him! For what? For what? For what, for spying? Come on. That's all I have, and I barely have that. Well, he might have seen something. Yeah? Yeah, you know what? He could have seen everything. But you know, that doesn't mean he did anything, does it? Look, I don't wanna cause him any trouble. Yeah, well, he's already in a lot of trouble. Well, more trouble. He's a nice enough guy. Little weird. So, um, what did you see? What I think I saw. It looked like one of our rooms. - From the hotel. - Yeah, on his iPad. I thought it was a movie, maybe some porn. I don't know how someone like that gets off, but it seems like porn would be the answer. - And why would you say that? - Because it was creepy. The way he was just sitting there when I found him in the room that night. - Just sitting. - Right. Like he was waiting for a bus. It's fucking weird, you know? Hi there. Hey. I haven't seen you for a while. How are you? Well, that's a very complicated question. Yeah, I bet it is. Anyway, it's good to see you now. Nice to see you too. Oh, they did some work in your room today on the A/C unit, so if anything has moved... Sure. Okay. You got a light? Excuse me? A match. Cigarette? A light? Smoking's not permitted on the premises. Yeah, I know that. Yeah, due largely to studies that have shown that when you have smoking and nonsmoking rooms, nicotine residues and other chemical traces end up in hallways and other rooms, including nonsmoking rooms, so... Bart, I know that. I'm going outside by the pool. I just need a match. Oh. I couldn't sleep. That's too bad. Yeah, it happens when I drink too much. People drink too much. Yeah, they do. Yeah. Thanks. I'll be outside if you want some company. This is a towel. What are you doing? You can't just... Turn around! - Goddamn. - We don't have a lifeguard. A what? A lifeguard. Right. You don't have one. No. You should. Yes, in the water. Come. Come here. Sit. Keep me company. You scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry. That's okay. You were kissing a man in that car. Yeah, well... Okay, you saw us. Yeah. Who was that? And why were you kissing him? That's a very complicated question. Oh. I guess so. You don't have someone? A girlfriend... like that? No. It's difficult, huh? Yes. I bet. And there's the problem of being perceived as odd or unsophisticated. Naive, clueless. Unfashionable. Or just plain stupid. Which you're not. You're not stupid, are you? No. But that's the perception. So it's very difficult for people to know what's going on inside that head. Yes, that's correct. Well, I wanna know. What is going on inside, Bart? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. What did you do? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. - Bart, it's okay. - Bart, what did you do? What did you do, Bart? Bart, it's okay. I'm sorry. Was that wrong to do that like that? Because if that was wrong to do that like that, I apologize, and I'll never do anything like that ever again. Bart, it's okay. Come here. Why don't you come here and sit with me? It's loneliness, Bart. Loneliness makes us do things. He's married. The man I was with. He's a married man. We've been seeing each other for a very long time. Secretly. Now... things have got confusing between us. So I don't know. Before, I knew what we were doing. But now... I have no idea what you're trying to say. Neither do I. "A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too." A what? Nerd. First documentation of the word. 1950. Dr. Seuss. If I Ran a Zoo. Used to label persons as odd or who are thought of as sexually unattractive. But more recently, technological proficiency is highly prized, so the nerd is often celebrated as a technosexual or even a sexy love god. Now I don't know what you're trying to say. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Are we talking about you? Yes. And what are you trying to say about you, besides being that you're a love god? I could be your lifeguard. Yeah, maybe you could. I don't know. I've never had one. Maybe you could. Bart. I need to get some sleep. I need to sleep, okay? Okay. Okay, good night. These are very close to the picture. And very well-made. Nice fit. Would you wear those? Why, yes, I would. I don't want something you would wear. Why not? Because you're old. Insurance looks okay. Registration, pink slip. Try this one. This has been a very popular scent. Are you okay? I mean, this is a really good deal. You know, if there's something... Wha... What's the matter? You need to lose weight. I'm sorry? Please don't touch my skin. I wanna smell like this. - Well, that's a picture. - Yes. Obesity is not just a cosmetic problem. It's a health hazard. You can touch my hair, but please just don't touch my skin. My skin is mine. Also, you're at a very high risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, gallstones, osteoarthritis and gout. It doesn't smell. Pictures don't smell. Why not? Because it's a picture. I'm not obese. Well, you are very, very fat. Okay, bye. Wow. Hello, Hamelton Hotel. How can I help you? Yes, Andrea Rivera, 107, please? Thank you. Okay, hold on. Hello? Hello? Who does that? Easy with that. Honey, I couldn't stop them. They have a search warrant. There was nothing I could do. - Hey, Bart. How you doin'? - You don't have to talk to him. Quite the setup you got here, my man. - You don't have to say anything to him. - Well, hello. He has no right to ask you anything, do you understand? Mrs. Bromley, I could either talk to him here or take him downtown. - Look, it's up to you. - All right, talk, talk. Thank you. So, Bart, this is where you spend your time, huh? - Yes. - Kind of dark. You see, that's what you don't understand, you see? This is his way of seeing the world. - No, no, no! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, Bart, um, your hard drive's empty. Yes. I wiped it. They were on your computer, honey. There was nothing I could do. And you wiped everything? Yes. And you didn't think of backing it up or maybe putting it on an external hard drive, maybe? No. Well, see, Bart, I don't believe that. I don't believe you. Well, that's too bad. Belief systems can be very tricky. Yeah, they can be, Bart. But you're hiding something. That's what I really believe, Bart. So what are you hiding? He's not hiding anything. Please. Bart, you get a lot of sympathy for being like this, don't you, huh? You get a little free pass. And what happens when your mom's not around? What happens when she's not there to fix it for you? How bad does it get when you get that lonely, Bart? What happens when you get that frustrated, Bart? - Does it just explode, Bart? - All right, that's enough! - Stop it! - Please, Mrs. Bromley. Please sit down! Now, I'm done fucking around with you, Bart. You know why? Because we found your fingerprints all over the room. So what happened, Bart? What happened? Did she invite you up? No. Well, maybe she was lonely. Maybe you were lonely. Maybe you went up. Maybe you thought you could have sex with her and maybe things got a little frustrating for you. Maybe got a little out of hand. Maybe you hit her, Bart. And then what, hmm? And then what happened? Well, Bart, you tell me. Then I guess I just pulled a gun from my pocket because I always have a gun in my pocket, - and I shot her. - Bart. But where did I get the gun? That's what I would like to know. - Bart. - Did I buy it? Did I steal it? Maybe I purchased it online, and then when I went to have sex with her, I brought the gun because, you know, it's always a good idea to take a gun when you go to have sex with someone because... Just in case you suffer from impotence or performance anxiety, and you get frustrated, and you can't do it, then you have a gun in your pocket, and, by golly, you just take it out and shoot that person! Bang, bang! And then the problem is solved. So where's that gun now, Bart? That was a joke. What's the matter with you? He doesn't have a gun. He was making a joke. Yeah, that was a good one, Bart. That was real good. But you know what, ma'am? We have a dead woman here, and I think Bart knows something about it. That's why I'm not laughing. Is he sick? No, I don't think so. I have Jack covering for him. He's not answering his cell. Thank you for your concern, really. I'm sure he's okay. I'm sure he's fine. Thanks. Bart? Bart, honey, are you down there? Bartholomew, I'm coming down. Okay, here I come. Oh, honey, there you are. You didn't touch your supper. Aren't you hungry? I'm fine. Mr. Benson called. He was worried about you. I worry too, Bart. I worry all the time. Life is hard, honey. Even for the best of us, life is very hard. When your father passed, that was very hard. I know it was hard for you. It was hard for me too. And never mind the pain. I know there was a lot of pain. And how much it hurt. That was bad, very bad, but not the worst part. The worst part was waking up in the morning and forgetting he was gone. Did you do that? You forget, and then you remember. You remember, and the world ends all over again. But you still have to get out of bed and make the coffee and the toast, 'cause the world doesn't really end. It just seems that way sometimes. The world is still there. It doesn't go away. It's still waiting for you. It's waiting for you too, honey. That's all. Okay? I'm going. I've thought this through so many times. It's the only way. It's... It's the only way. Do you love me? Do you care what happens to me? I do. You know I do. We deserve this. Yes? I'm looking for Bart. It's Bart, um... Bromley? Yes. Sorry. I'm his mother. Hi. And who are you? Andrea. I'm a friend of his. Really? You're his friend? Well, I know him from the hotel. He doesn't work there anymore. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. I thought... I thought he was out sick or something. No. That's what they told me. Is he home? Hi, Bart. I'm fine. I've missed you. Yes? At the hotel. I was wondering where you were. Yes. How are you? That's a... Complicated question. - Yeah, I know. - Yes. I have a broken heart. You do? Yes, it's very painful. I bet. In a 1993 study, individuals who said that they were in love had their brains scanned to show neural activity. The map showed vivid colors over the gray matter, indicating clearly that this romantic love phenomenon activates a flood of dopamine in the caudate nucleus in exactly the same way that cocaine and nicotine affect the brain, meaning that love is not an emotion, as is usually thought. Rather, it's an addiction. When these chemicals are released in our brains, we feel giddy and euphoric, so much to the point that we can be so in love that we don't have the desire to eat or to sleep. So it feels good when you have... the drug or the love, but when it's taken away, you hurt. Heartbreak. Yes. I'm sorry. Addiction is a very dangerous thing. Yeah, I know. Believe me. People die from it. People die from love. Yeah. And then that's the end. They die, and that's the end. Bart. Fuck this. Bart, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry for everything. Because you're a nice person. You're very special. And if things were different, you know, I... But they aren't. They just... They just aren't, so... Listen. I'm just very happy to have met you. And I won't bother you anymore. I promise. No more. Take care. I don't understand. So you're in love with me, but you don't love me enough? Oh, my God. Just... Nick... You don't understand. - That's not what I mea. - What do you mea? - Just don't! - What? Don't what? Don't be mad? - Don't be upset? Don't... - Let go of me. Just fucking let go of me! Wha... Do you think that I'm stupid? You think I'm fucking stupid? Where are you fucking going? I can't do this! I need to go! - No! - I have to go. No! I can't do this! No! Damn, Nick, you're crazy. I have to go. - Don't, don't. - I can't do this! Don't be a fucking... No! No! Just leaving, huh? I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay. Andrea, it's Bart. It's just me. Bart, what are you doing here? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay, first... First, there's... There's blood on that towel. - It's okay. - He hit you. I saw him. You saw what? Boy. Oh, boy, Oh, boy. Oh... - Okay, just... - What did you do? Calm down! I can show you. You can see. See what? Show me what? What are you talking about? Bart! I saw him. Oh, my God. I can show you. You can see. You saw him with me? Yes. I'm sorry. What are you saying? What is this? Bart? - Bart! - I can show you. You fucking recorded this? I'm sorry. What is the matter with you? Oh, my God. Please, you need to see. Come with me. Come with me. You need to see, and you'll be safe. Please. You need to see. I'll go with you. I'll go with you! We can pretend like I'm just some... easy piece of ass that you meet in a hotel. I'm leaving. Regularly. Secretl. A fuck buddy, whatever they call it. - Is that what she is? - Shut up! Shut up. The rough stuff, huh? - Is that what you want? - Is that what she liked? - Did she like it rough? - I said shut up! She like it... Bastard! You bastard! I can't... I can't watch this. - See? - I can't. See? I didn't mean to... - I just watch to learn what people do. - I can't think. But I didn't mean to do anything bad. Stop, Bart. Stop, stop! Oh, my God. Did you show this to the police? No. Anybody? Has anybody seen this? No, just you. It's all here. - And they don't know I have it. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Bart. - Bart. - Wait, wait. This is a very bad man, and he could hurt you. He did hurt you. He already hurt you. - I can't. - And... we could go to the police together. I would do that if you were with me. I would do anything for you. You don't even know me. Yes, I do. I do. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Fix my heart. I can't. I can't. Good morning, sleepyhead. Hey. I was just going to wake you up. What are you... I'm ready to go. Wait. Come here. It's so easy. It's so easy. I was thinking... that maybe we could go to the city. Spend some time together. It's so easy to touch you. To talk to you. To look at you. Kiss me. All done? - ♪ Sleep, my child ♪ - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. ♪ And peace attend thee ♪ ♪ All through the night ♪ How did you pay... Maybe she was... - Bang, bang! - ♪ Guardian angels ♪ ♪ God will send ♪ Bart. ♪ All through the night ♪ Bart? Bart! Wait, wait, wait. Let me go in, let me go in. Look, I need to know. Is he here or not? - Hold her. - Let me go in first! Hold her, please. Bart? There was a gun. I don't wanna know!

We can pretend like I'm just some... easy piece of ass that you meet in a hotel. Regularly. Secretly. A fuck buddy... Bart! I think this person might be dead. Okay. We're not in love. Dear Detective, I'm sorry I didn't give these to you sooner because it would show you that I'm not the person you're looking for. Oh, son of a bitch. - Whatever they call it. - Shut up! Shut up. Oh, Bart. What did you do? What did you do? How you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'?
