You got a pencil? Shoot. Cop: 619 930 a-108 d-4 you got it? Yup. Damn! (Heavily breathing) (Whispering) Come on, man! Shit! (Glass shattering) (Phone ringing) (Answering machine) Hi, this is Joey. I'm not here right now. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Wait for the beep. (Beeping) Charles: Joseph, this is your father, I'm going to be in Los Angeles at the end of the week. Perhaps, we could have dinner, if I'm not too busy. Give me a call. Bradley. Bradley! (Dial tone) Shit! (Cat meowing) (Sighs) Piece of shit! Sam: What was that? What'd you call me? No, Sam, not you. I'm talking to the computer. Sam: Oh, sorry. All right, now read out all the dimensions back to me. Sam: Uh, 66.14. Joey: You can't do that, Sam. Sam: Well, why not? It's twice what I need. Sam, I told you. You have a stress factor of three. Sam: Three? Yes, three. I'm looking at it right now. Three. Yeah, look, it's coming up... Hold on, it's coming up right now. Oh, no! Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. (Sighs) It's all right, Denise. It's not your fault. Don't worry about it. Sam: It's not my fault, pal. Sam, I know it's not your fault. Joey: All right? I wasn't talking to you. (Chuckling) I have a problem here. I have to go. Sam: All right, bye. Janet: I'm so excited about this. I promise, you won't regret it. You don't know how much this promotion means to me. Janet, I've got great confidence in your abilities. Watson: You catch on to things real fast. We're very proud of you. Joey, are you gonna let Janet get away with that? You did all the work. That's your promotion. Congratulations, Janet. Thanks, Joey. (Chuckling) Sounds good. I'll get there when I get there. Right, I'll catch you later, man. Bye. So what's with you anyway? Watson promoted Janet today. Janet? Janet, Janet... Oh, she's the new chick you were telling me about. Yeah, she's got Watson wrapped around her little finger. It's disgustingly sick. What are you gonna do about it? Joey: What can I do? He's the boss. Nothing. Joey. Just uh... I've had some bad breaks. You know, I just haven't been lucky like you. Eddie: Lucky? Hey, luck didn't have anything to do with it. Joey: Look, I'm not saying you don't have any talent, Eddie I'm just saying you're the luckiest guy I've ever met. Eddie: Oh, that's bullshit, Joey. Eddie: Hey, I've had plenty of bad luck, man. Like what? Well, like when my car got stolen last week. Huh? Eddie, the cops found it two days later, undamaged with a full tank of gas. Joey, you want something bad, you work your ass off for it and then you get it. I mean, your problem is you blame everything that goes wrong on bad luck. Eddie. And that is bullshit. Eddie. What? Look! (Honking) (Tires screeching) Luck didn't have anything to do with it, Joey. If it wasn't for bad luck... (Both singing) ¶ I wouldn't have no luck at all. ¶ (mimicking guitar sound) (Chuckling) Want me to wait? Uh, no, I called in. They said it was ready. Okay, listen, you stop by the studio sometime. Yeah. All right, Eddie. Thanks a lot. Okay. Drive safe. (Tires screeching) (Engine starting) (Engine dying) (Engine dying) (Engine starts) ¶ ¶ Sun beats hard on an empty beach ¶ where I tried so hard ¶ but couldn't reach the stars ¶ in your eyes ¶ you were just a child ¶ when I came to you ¶ and we were friends ¶ till love stepped in ¶ and you stepped away ¶ yeah ¶ (Answering machine beeping) Charles: Joseph, this is your father, I'm going to be in Los Angeles at the end of the week. Perhaps, we could have dinner, if I'm not too busy. Give me a call. I won't hold my breath. (Answering machine beeping) Uh, this is frank at speed motor works on olympic. Your car is done. I'll try you at the office. Thank you. (Answering machine beeping) Melissa: Joey, I hope this is your number. Anyway, it's Melissa. Dave and I are meeting at palermo's at nine. Wanna join US? What's with the weird message? Bye. (Answering machine beeping) Cop: Got a pencil? Man: Shoot. Cop: 619 930 a-108 d-4. You got it? Man: Yup. Cop: Got a pencil? Man: Shoot. Cop: 619 930 a-108 d-4. You got it? Man: Yup. (Clattering) (Meowing) Man: Black male, 31. Name's Howard white. Two gunshot wounds in the chest. He's hung up in the shower with a vacuum cleaner chord. Wexler: Okay, tell those guys with the paper they'll get a statement in the morning. Hi, I'm lieutenant wexler. Are you Joey Bradley? Yes, sir. Have you ever seen this man before? No, sir. Wexler: Sorry about all this mess. But we have to do our job. Oh, uh, right. I found this, um... This tape in my machine. It's not mine. I don't know whose it is. There's some voices on it and a long number. I copied the number down. Does this number mean anything to you? No, not a thing. Joey: Must have meant something to him though, huh? Man: Hey, lieutenant, something's burning in here. Oh, shit! (Fire alarm beeping) Goddamn it! It was a p.I. From San Francisco. He had to be working with Bradley's paper. Man: So, why kill him in his son's apartment? I followed him there. How was I supposed to know it was his son's apartment? Man: Great. Now the kid has the number and we can't let him talk to his old man or he'll figure out we know about the meeting. (Scoffing) That's a shame. I'll have to hit him. Man: Yeah, he left US no choice. Don't fuck it up. I won't. Ah! Come on! (Honking) Shit! Damn it! Get a tattoo. (Chuckling) Uh, and a lottery ticket, too please. Thief: Okay, come on. (Engine starts) Hey! (Gun fires) (Siren wailing) Kim: (On tape) For the last two years, I middle-manned the illicit sale of large quantities of police confiscated drugs. Heroin, cocaine. To protect myself, I kept complete records of all transactions including photographs and recordings of phone conversations. Charles: (On tape) You dealt directly with the cops? Kim: Yes. This evidence can put the ringleader and the other cops in jail. I know you're already doing a story on this. Charles: How do you know that? Kim: I just know. Are you interested? Charles: Yes, of course I'm interested. But... Only if it's exclusive. Kim: I'm sure we can come to some arrangement. It'll take me a few days to gather things together. Then, I will call you. Cliff. I've been working on this story for six months. It's at least a statewide operation. Kim claims there's a 100 kilos of confiscated cocaine missing from police vaults. Lot of cops are involved. The ringleader's based in L.A., but we don't know who he is. Kim is handing US this whole thing on a silver platter. Cliff: Jesus Christ! Charles, you're not the FBI. Now, this is risky! Cliff, this is the story we need. We can scoop everyone. We can even scoop the FBI. I'm telling you, there's a pulitzer here. Look, a quarter of a million dollars is a lot to gamble. I know. I know. Kim has sold me information before. He's scum but he's never cheated me. Besides, he's in big trouble. He needs US. Well, the board will never approve this. I'll have to get the money from the private account. Well, whatever it takes, but it'll have to be fast. Meeting's on Thursday. Kim: You will come alone, Charles. Many would like me dead. There won't be any second chances, so don't do anything stupid. These are my conditions. Do you accept? Charles: Yes. Charles, one of these days, you're gonna go too far for a goddamn story. Cliff, you can't ever go too far to find a good goddamn story. (Chuckling) You don't have any idea who tried to kill you? No idea. You know, you shouldn't go back to your apartment tonight. They tried once, they might try again. Do you have some place where you can stay? Some safe place? Um... My sister's out of town. I could stay at her place. I guess, it'll be safe there. That's good. I'll take you. Joey: Yeah, it's right here. Looks all right. Remember, stay inside. Keep the door locked. Don't tell anybody where you are. An officer will be here shortly. He'll spend the night with you. We'll take you into headquarters in the morning. Try to get this mess straightened out. Okay? All right. Uh, thanks a lot. (Locking door) (Phone ringing) (Answering machine) Hi, this is Kate. I'm out of town till the 20th. But I check in, so leave a message. Thanks, bye. (Beeping) Hi, Kate, this is ed mcfarlen calling. Just wanted to let you know I'm coming into L.A. on Friday. And, uh, how's about dinner? I'll be staying over at the Marquis, so give me a call. (Honking) Larry: Howard's dead. They found him in your son's apartment. Larry, what the hell was Howard white doing in my son's apartment? We agreed it would be a drop-off spot if anything happened. I didn't want him involved. Larry: I'm sorry. Do you know where he is now? No, I don't. I suggest you find him. (Sighing) (Buzzing) Hello? Officer Ryan, Los Angeles police department. Um, all right, I'm gonna buzz you in. It's 301. That's on the third floor. (Buzzing) Joey: Officer Ryan? That's me. Come on in. Hi. How you doing? Uh... (Sighs) I'm okay. I'm just watching some TV. Mmm, what are you making? Chili. Uh, if... If you want something to eat, I can make you chili or I got some spam... No. I'm not so sure how to make it though. That's okay. No thanks, i'm... I'm fine. (Sighing) Joey: Are you all right? Yeah, I'd like a glass of water if that's not too much trouble. No, no. I think you should have it. Joey: I'm not so sure about glasses but I'll see what I've got. Everything's kind of a mess. Shit! The place is pretty empty, isn't it? Yeah, my sister just bought it. She's moving in. Not bad. Guess that leaves you all alone, huh? Yeah, she's down in San Diego getting the rest of her stuff. Yeah, well... It's nice. Hey. Bathroom big enough for two. It's a great life. When you got the money... Of course, they don't make this on my salary. I'm not gonna blame you. You see... I just keep the peace. Man: (On TV) Look. I'm sorry. Man: (On TV) The bullet fired from outside smashed the window. (Phone ringing) (Answering machine) Hi, this is Kate. I'm out of town till the 20th. But I check in, so leave a message. Thanks, bye. (Answering machine beeping) Joseph, this is your father. I thought you might be at Kate's. If you get this message, please call me. It's urgent. (Gunshot) Damn! Hey, what's going on? Ow, shit! (Groaning) (Groaning) (Car horn blares) (Tires screeching) (Grunts) Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Are you all right? Are you crazy? You ran right in front of me. I didn't even see you! (Coughs) I'm all right, I'm all right. Look, you wanna go to a hospital or... A hospital? Uh, yeah, yeah, the... The hospital, or should I call the cops? I don't know! Oh, my god. Look... At least you're all right, it was your fault, you know. You sure you're all right? No hospitals, no cops. Let me just sit in your car for a sec. My car? Wait, hold on, I'll help you. Yeah. Here, here, let me... Woman: Hey, is he okay? Is he all right? Everything's fine! Everything's okay. Shit! Why me? Why tonight? Woman: Are you sure? Are you sure he's okay? He's fine. Could you drive, please? That man is after me. After you? Why? Just start the car. Let's go! Shit. Just tell me where you want me to take you, okay? Great. Great, this is just what I wanted to have happen to me. Man: (On TV) Bill collectors. We make bill collectors leave you alone, and that means leave you alone! I am Hugh slate, of the law firm slate and Leoni. We can stop the telephone calls. We can stop the lawsuits, garnishments and foreclosures. For recorded information, phone US in Los Angeles, day or night. Pick up your phone and dial. No bills. Hey, how are you feeling? Jesus, you had me worried there for a while. You passed out, you know. Oh, yeah. Your pants are ripped. I washed them. Your leg's all right, you just scraped some skin off, that's all. You want some hot chocolate? Uh... No thanks. Water would be great, though. Want some more? Please. And some aspirin, if you have any. Oh, I'll be right back. (Line ringing) Hello, this is Charles Bradley, I am unable to take your call at this time. Please leave the time and date of your message at the sound of the tone. (Beeping) Dad, this is Joey. I think I'm in some kind of trouble and I need to talk to you. I'm going to Eddie's, I'll call you from there. Um, I don't have any aspirin. I don't like TV much. I had cable for free, but they caught me. Does anyone else know that I'm here? Nope, I guess not. Why did you bring me here? You don't even know me. No, I know plenty about you. Your name is Joseph Bradley, you're 24 years old, you're an architect, and you're single. (Laughs) Besides, I... Hit you with my car, so it's the least I could do. Very impressive. (Clears throat) So... Who are you? Oh. Jenny fox. Hi. I live here by myself. I work for Thomas brothers. You know, the map people? Yeah. I can get you a map book cheap. Thanks, I already have one. You still have your seven dollars. Where are my pants? Well, I told you, they were ripped and I washed them, they're still wet. (Sighs) What am I supposed to wear then? Oh, just hang on! Here, these ought to fit you. Very nice. Are these yours? No, my ex's. What happened? Don't be nosy. Here. This will go with the pants better than your shirt. Look, you're in some kind of trouble, aren't you? Don't be so nosy, huh? Got any shoes? Yeah. Yeah. (Laughs) You're gonna love these. Uh, no, there's gotta be something else around here that I can wear. Well, I'm really sorry, this isn't the men's department at Macy's, you know. I think that's a very cute outfit. Yeah, well... I feel like a smurf. So, where are we? At my place. Yeah, but where is that? Silver lake. Wallpaper comes in pretty handy, huh? You can talk to me, you know. It's all right. Maybe I can help you. Well, if you really want to be a good samaritan, there is one thing... Oh, and what might that be? A ride, right there. Yeah, if that's what you want, sure. Wait a minute, what's this? Mace. For dogs and rapists, in case you need it. I don't think so, I don't think I'm going to be getting raped today. Go on, take it. You never know. I'll, uh... Get these clothes back to you. Oh, no, you keep 'em. I don't need 'em. Thanks. My good deed for the day. Oh, look, you're not going to sue me, are you? 'Cause I don't have any insurance or anything... No, really, it's okay. Don't worry about it. (Electronic whirring) (Music playing over speaker) Eddie. Where the fuck have you been? It's a long story. Come in here a minute, I've gotta talk to you. Be right back, guys. Yeah, dig those threads, man. Is this image change a permanent thing or what? Eddie... Your father called. What? Yeah. He called here? Yeah. Said it was real important that you meet some guy named Larry? Larry who? I don't know, I wrote it down. Let's have a look. "Baldwin hills oil field, 7:00 A.M." Yeah, he said you're not gonna be able to reach him, he's not staying at home. He said you just be there 7:00 A.M., no matter what. You sure it was my father? Yeah, I'm sure. Positive? Yeah. And he said you should stay away from the cops. Jesus, Joey, what kind of weird shit is your old man up to now? I don't know, Eddie. Somebody tried to kill me last night. What? I'm not going to any oil field, fuck! If someone's trying to kill you, don't you think you should do what your father says? Look, I don't care, I'm not going. He was serious, man. Now you do it! Since when do you give a shit what my father says? You don't even like him! Hey, that's got nothing to do with this! You're in deep shit here. I am not going to any oil field. You're going! No, I'm not! Yes, you are. All right. Give me your keys. What, my car keys? Yeah! I don't have a car anymore, Eddie, it was totaled last night! Come on, Eddie, we've got work to do. Give him the car, man! You don't drive like I do, Joey. Nobody drives like you do, Eddie. (Engine starts) Be careful, Joey. (Tires screeching) (Vehicle approaching) Joey? Is that you? Who wants to know? My name's Larry, i'm a private investigator working for your father's paper. Hold it! Hey, look, I'm here to help you, man. Your father wants me to take you to San Francisco. Didn't he talk to you? No, we don't talk much. Why San Francisco? He's concerned for your safety. Look, I... I'll explain it all to you in the car. We've gotta get going. Look, I'm not going anywhere until I figure out what's going on. Look, I'm not in a very good mood. This is serious. Your father is... Your father is onto some crooked cops. He's got a meeting set up with an informer that could blow this thing wide open. He doesn't want you screwing it up. Yeah, well, you don't look very much like a private investigator to me. You wanna get in the car, or you want some cop to shoot your ass off? It's your funeral. Hey. Who was the dead guy in my apartment? My partner. Ah! (Groaning) Nice shot, Lou. Don't even fantasize about it! Now, drop it. I said, drop it! Beaned you! Right in the potato, didn't I? (Grunts) Get up. He said, get up! Ah! Shut up! Nobody told you to talk, shut up! Yeah, yeah, this is the guy. Well, well, Joey. It's time we had a little fun, huh? (Laughing) Let's go, Joey. Do you know where? Where what? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, that's too bad, lover, 'cause you're gonna make it real hard on your friend there. Joey: Wait, stop, tell me what you want to know. Gil: You come on, boy. You know what I'm talking about, don't ya? You know where? Joey: No, stop, no! (Gagging) (Grunting) (Choking) Look at the man! Look! You're next, Joey! (Choking) Come on, boy. Joey: Who are you guys? I don't even know who you guys are! Gil: Come on, Joey. Joey: I swear I don't know! We've got a little surprise for you, boy. Little Joey. Right down here, Joey. Talk to US, Joey. Talk to you about what? I don't know what you're talking about. You know when and where it's going to happen? When and where what? I don't know anything! Come on, Joey! Does anybody know? Does anybody know what? I don't... just tell me what you want to... aah! Know! I got something for you. (Shouting) Oh! Ugh! Oh, you... I'll get you for this! (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Phone rings) Hello? Joey? It's Eddie, I've been trying to call you. What's going on? Are you okay? I... I don't know. I think I need some help. Need some help? Why? Where are you? Shit! Joey? Joey? Joey! (Tires screeching) Stupid jerk! (Sighs) (Baby crying) Joey, what's happening? Eddie. Look, I gotta go now, there's a cop pulling me over, all right? Your father said to stay away from the cops! Look... Call me back in five minutes, I've gotta go. Please. Okay, five minutes. I'll call back. (Officer on loudspeaker) Step outside of the car and put your hands behind your head. Step out of the car and put your hands behind your head. Keep your back to me and put your hands behind your head. Now back up to the patrol car. (Radio chatter) Keep your head forward. Okay, stop. Get down on your knees. (Handcuffs clinking) Okay, get up. What's the problem here? You're driving a stolen car. Stolen? Wait, it was stolen! Last week, it was stolen. But it was returned. Look! You can call my friend, Eddie. It's his car! I was just talking to him on the phone. Look, check the computer, it should be on there! (Phone ringing) Morning, cliff, you got the money? Yup. Hear anything from Larry or Joseph? Uh, not yet... I don't like this, Charles, maybe we should back off. Cliff, if they wanted Joseph dead, he'd be dead. Obviously. They don't know we have Kim. We are now holding all the cards. Officer: '85 Porsche. 2-r. It's a red one. Mmm-hmm. I'll be right here. Okay. (Door opens and closes) What did you hear from Lou and Gil? Nothing. They're out there tailing that p.I., Larry what's-his-name. Last I heard, they were going to the oil fields? Mmm-hmm. Shit, you all right? Yeah. What's the matter with you? Nothing, why? You been snorting that stuff again? Come on. I told you, you're not supposed to be doing that shit. You're not supposed to be selling it, either. Wexler: You're doing too much. You're screwing up. Come on. It's all luck. That kid is one lucky bastard, that's all. There's no such thing as luck, either you're smart or you're stupid. Joey Bradley is out there somewhere, walking around with that number in his head. What if he talks to his old man? What if they figure it out? I don't want to take that chance. Do you? You know how long an ex-cop lasts in the federal penitentiary? Why don't you relax? Everything's going to be fine. (Sighs) There's been nothing on Bradley's phone tap, he's on his way. The meeting is definitely on. Excuse me. Officer Hollister? I'm Eddie Gordon. Came down to get my car, the red Porsche? Hollister: Hey! You're Eddie Gordon, the singer, aren't you? Yeah, yeah, that's me. Hey, man, I saw you on soul train. I like your stuff. Oh, you caught that, thanks. Eddie: Uh, what is this man doing in handcuffs? Suspicion of auto theft. Oh, he didn't steal my car, I loaned it to him. Hollister: You know this guy? Eddie: Know him? Yeah, he's my gardener. Well, you think you could take those cuffs off him? Hollister: Well, you see, it's not that simple. I don't even have a good ID on this guy. Man, come on, officer. I mean, this is all a big mistake, and my car was stolen last week and already returned. What do you say? You'll never guess who's here. Who? Come on, I'll show you. You always let your gardener take your car? Eddie: Ah, well, his Mercedes was in the shop. (Whispering) I think that's the guy who tried to kill me. Hollister! Never mind. Oh, excuse me. Would you excuse me? (Stamps foot) Oh! Today, not tomorrow. Pardon me, officer. Good. Thank you. Corporal, you take 3rd street, I'll take 4th street, and we'll squeeze him, okay? What are you doing, huh? What are you doing? What are you doing against the car? What's the hell's the matter with you? Just fixed up the car. Get out of here! (Door closes) (Door opens) Coffee? Yeah. Know what you want? Can I borrow your pencil for just a second? Thanks. Six-one-nine. Six. Waitress: Order of scrambled eggs, wheat toast, no butter and a side of browns. Excuse me. I, uh... I'm really hungry and I don't have any money. But, I will give you this $50 winning lottery ticket if you let me order anything I want. Must be cash to place a purchase. No, no. I know. Wait, wait, wait. I'll give it you right now. Right here. No can do. Look, this is a winner. You are winner. Winning ticket. Qualifies you for the big spin, grand prize. Take it. Sorry. What? Look. All I want from you is a cheeseburger. Waitress: Ordering a... (Door opens) Hey. Get outta here, lady. (Yells) Excuse me. Janet, I've got a client breathing down my neck on this project. I need some answers now. I'm sure that I could make this work if Joey was here. Where is he? You're the one that's supposed to be the expert on this project. You hear me? What the hell is going on? Fucking door. Where the hell have you been? Where you been? Janet: Joey! Man: Where you been? Man: Joey, boy, are you okay? (Joey yells) Get out. (Indistincy chatter) (Laughing) No, don't stop. Come on, the TV. Police officer! Hold or I shoot. Robber: Oh, shit, it's the cops. Get outta here. Would you get in the car? Fucking criminals. Hey! (Yells) Uh... I'm sorry. Shh. Don't yell. It's me, Joey. And you tell me you won't hurt me, stupid. What are you doing? You scared me to death. Look at the mess you've made. You have a lot of nerve barging in here like this. What're you... What're you thinking of? I didn't want anyone to know I was here. There are some very dangerous people after me. Yeah. Well, I just might join them if you pull anymore stunts like this. I'm sorry. For once I go to the store, look what happens. Look, I haven't eaten in two days, okay. Can't you wait? I'll fix you something. I can't. Oh, I... I ripped your shirt a little. (Groans) Nasty bruise. Ow! Not half as bad as the one you gave me. Oh, you're just saying that. I bet you say that to all the girls who run you over. Wanna see my bruises? Don't you think you should tell me what's going on? Don't be so nosy. (Clock ticking) What? Do you know, Joey? What you talking about? I swear... (Groans) I swear to god, you guys. I don't know anything. Wexler: Wanna talk, punk? What does it mean? (Choking) He doesn't know anything. Fuck you, Joey. (Yells) What's wrong? What happened? I was having a nightmare. Oh, gosh, you scared me. I'm sorry. Are you all right? Yeah. Oh, god, no. Joey. Joey. What're you doing? Six-nineteen is the date. Today's date. 9:30 is the time. A.M., which is one hour from now. Ten-eight. D-four. No. I don't get it. The meeting, the meeting, the meeting. Do you know when it's gonna happen? Yes, I know when it's gonna happen. But where? What're you doing? Wait. Look. 108. 108, d-4. That's it. What's what? Then wexler must have known the entire time. He was afraid that I'd figure it out and tell. Tell who? My father. He's meeting an informant and it's an ambush. Joey? Joey: What time is it? It's almost 9:15. Shit. How close are we? I don't know. It's at least five miles. Come on. Come on. Wait. That's it. That's it. That's box canyon road. Turn around. (Tires screeching) Bang, bang. You're dead. (Car approaching) Joey: Now how much time do we have left? Seven minutes. How close? About half a mile. It's just around the corner and over that hill. What're you doing? I'm gonna go ahead and check it out. Stay with the car. (Screaming) Jesus. Just give it to US, Bradley. Okay. Okay. Hand it over. Ryan: Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot that bastard. Drop it, lover. Jenny: Joey! Joey, are you all right? Yeah. It's about time you showed up. Pull over. What? (Shouting) Pull over. I can't hear you, Joey. Ryan: Wait a minute! Come on! Wexler! Wexler! Son of a bitch. Kim, glad you could make it. Who is the bag man? My brother-in-law. Stupid man. Uh-oh. Jenny, get out of the car.
