AFTER THE CURFEW Main cast Cinematography: MAX TERA Art Direction: ABDUL CHALID Sound Direction: B. SALTZMANN Editor: SUMARDJONO Original Story and Screenplay Original Music Produced by Directed by The curfew in Bandung from 10:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. will remain in force until January 8, 1950, or until further notice. You, stop! Stop! Iskandar. These ex-freedom fighters, always doing things differently. Luckily the army only shouted a warning last night. If they had shot Iskandar, then what would we have done? Perhaps he didn't know about the curfew. Curfew or not, if we are ordered to stop, we must stop. But who wants to be arrested, Father? And if your fiancé gets shot, who will mourn for him? Iskandar must get a job as quickly as possible. Just send him back to school. Let him figure things out for himself. Someone like him shouldn't be without work. Idleness could destroy him. Too many temptations. Shouldn't you ask him about this? Iskandar? Iskandar? Iskandar? It's almost noon. Is he awake? Iskandar! Iskandar? Iskandar. What's wrong? I picked one of your flowers. In the mountains, there are many flowers like this. What did you do there besides picking flowers? Fooled around. Chased the villagers' chickens. I had some very good friends: Gafar, Puja and Gunawan, our commander. Sir, here's your chicken. Its feathers are really beautiful. This one isn't domesticated. It's always trying to run away. It's nice and plump though. Plenty of fat on her. You can have her if you like. - Oh... - Go ahead, accept it. I have many more chickens. Thank you, sir. Excuse us. Why did you give Si Kumang away? What's the problem? Those young people fighting are our children too. Do you know what I dreamt of becoming? I wanted to become a chicken farmer. And if possible, I'd raise goats and cows as well. Why don't you stay in the army? I'm tired of all that. I want a little peace. I've done more than enough. It's peaceful enough for you here, isn't it? Indeed. I heard that you hardly slept last night. My mind is always restless. Why? During the war I usually slept on the ground. At best, maybe a wooden bench. Now suddenly, I sleep in a clean white bed... and my body feels strange. As though you'd never slept in a proper bed before. In the future, I will take care of you. You haven't changed. I thought you'd get married after I left. It's nearly five years ago... and you were still very young back then. Do you know what your father wanted? For me to become an engineer, a person of status, so that I wouldn't get involved in politics. But I didn't pay any attention to him. It might have been better if I had followed his advice. But it was the call of duty. Surely you gained some worthwhile experience on the battlefield. Experience. From the mountains this city looked very beautiful. I thought it would be easy to return to normal life. Why is it so difficult now? You wouldn't have recognized me back then, driven crazy by hatred for an enemy that we rarely saw. Maybe everyone felt the same. As if someone was pushing you onwards, without giving you the time to think or to look around. You simply had to struggle, to fight, to kill! What's wrong? Iskandar? Then it was all over... before we even knew what had happened. That's revolution. Do you still love me? Didn't I come straight here to you? This is the only place for me. Iskandar! Let's have breakfast. I've promised to take you to the governor's office today. A good friend of mine has an important position there. He will give you a job. Why don't you become a student again? Like you, forever a student. Iskandar once wanted to be an engineer, Dad. So did you. And what's going to happen to you, chasing women every day? This will be a good job for Iskandar. Why should you decide whether Iskandar works or not? Your father's suggestion is a good one. I agree with him. Good. You don't want to let Norma become an old maid. We'll leave in a few minutes. Are you coming with me, Adlin? Or do you have class today? Whatever you like. Where are you going? Shopping on Jalan Braga. We're throwing a party for Iskandar tonight. Sure. Why accept just any job? You said you wanted to raise cattle. Forget about that. That was just a dream. You've already waited for me long enough. Iskandar. This is the man. - Thank you. - Really, it's nothing. Just doing my duty. We have to help the young people who come back from the war. If we don't, they could easily go astray. Iskandar is your future son-in-law, isn't he? Yes, that's right. - He... - Very well then. Until we meet again. So you've just returned from the front line? Yes. My son was killed during the struggle. Where, sir? In Semarang. At the beginning of the revolution. But... enough about that. Independence could not have been won without sacrifice. I heard you were a lieutenant in the war. Yes. And before that, you were a student at Bandung Technical Institute? Yes. Right then. Follow me. I'll place you in Public Works. This is Iskandar. He recently returned from the war. He's a former lieutenant and student. I want him to work here. But which desk should he use? Get him to move elsewhere. He can move over beside that man. Very well. - May your work go well. - Thank you. Please, sit over there beside Nurdin. Iskandar, please sit down. What do they think I am? I'm always being shifted. From place to place, like a bottle of beer. From the cupboard to the table, from the table to the floor, perhaps next to the toilet. He's an ex-freedom fighter. He thinks he's the son of a king and can do as he pleases. Aren't we freedom fighters too? See if you can figure this out. Let me see your progress. How's it going? I don't understand it. What sort of work do you understand? I don't know. You don't know! I was told you were a lieutenant and a student. Some student! More of a peasant than a student! You may be an ex-freedom fighter and the boss's future son-in-law. You might even be the devil, but work like that and I'll fire you! What's going on? He was just given a job and he's hitting people! - Hi, Ida! - Hello. What have you been up to? Same as ever, going here and there. Flirting at this hour. You should talk. You've only been apart from Iskandar for a few minutes, and you're panicking. - When was I panicking? - Earlier this morning. Has Iskandar returned? Yes, sis, he arrived last night. I've never met him. I'll introduce you to him later, sis. Half a kilo of these. So the man you yearned for has finally arrived. What does he look like? Is he tall, slim, handsome and brave? And half a kilo of these too. Oh, he's nothing extraordinary. Adlin is far more dashing. Hey, don't be sarcastic. It's true. Isn't it, sis? May I try one? You've got a lot of cookies there. Are they all for your beloved Iskandar? I almost forgot. We're having a party for him tonight. A party for the returning hero! At what time? People can come whenever they like, so long as it's before 10:00, because of the curfew. Half a kilo of these as well. Who cares about the curfew? We don't have to go home until the morning. We'll make it a long night. Make it double, all of these. That's right. Straight through until morning. Tomorrow's Sunday, isn't it? That's fine by me. I'll ask my father. Why didn't you bring the hero with you? He began work today. Well, isn't he diligent. How can this be? You'll have to work faster. Gafar! - Iskandar! When did you arrive? - Last night. Why hasn't this been installed yet? It's hard to find labor, sir. How can that be? Call the foreman, please. Here. Take this. How are things going? Li! Help him to lift those beams! You should come to my house. You can tell me about everything at length. I'm really pleased to see you back. Things are very different now. I need to talk to you now. Did you want something, sir? Wait. I'm very busy now. Come by later. But I really need to... We'll talk in a while. - I have to go inside for a moment. - Yes, sir. This way. Impressive, isn't it? What do you want to talk about? I need a job. That can be arranged. But I need a job that suits me. You need to get used to being back. Don't do anything at all for two weeks. I couldn't do that to my fiancée. It's not as easy as I had imagined. What do you find so difficult? You're living in her father's house, aren't you? That's the problem. Norma and I need to get our own place as soon as possible. I fear that right now... I'm surrounded by people who don't live in the real world. They don't take anything seriously. Everything is light and easy. But we're different. We are always in earnest, whether in war or in maintaining our ideals. Maybe you're exaggerating. Aren't they kind to you? Perhaps. It's just that I feel like a foreigner when I'm with them. What do you think? Killing and being killed. Are these not serious matters? Remember the screams... of that woman I shot at dawn? I can still hear her. That was the first time I saw... the people I was about to kill. Perhaps you thought I killed because I was bored? You have to stop thinking about it. What happened is in the past. You have other obligations now. You must look to the future. - Put all that behind you. - No, I can't. You know, it's strange. I'm starting to doubt... that the people I killed were guilty. What if they weren't guilty? That's not the issue. In a revolution, anything can happen. But at a certain point, we must be able to say, "Stop! That's enough!" Those are just words. You've adjusted back to normal life quickly. It's easy for you to say "stop" or things like that. But what about me? How can I say "stop"? I can feel it in my body. For me this is the beginning of being normal again. Norma's father found me a job at the governor's office. They gave me a desk and asked me to work on something I knew nothing about. Maybe I can't even write anymore. So, what happened? I fought with my supervisor. He insulted me, so I hit him. I didn't come back to be insulted and ridiculed. Who do they think I am? You have to help me. You're the only friend who can help me. All right, come to my house later this afternoon. Gunawan has become wealthy too now. Why do you say that? - I want to meet him. - You better not, Isk. Why not? He used to be my father. What did I not do for him? Adlin, help me decorate the room. You'll have a lot to eat tonight. You'll be dancing tonight as well. Come in. Can I help you, sir? I'd like to see Mr. Gunawan. Yes, I understand. Yes, but I can't do it right now. You have to be patient. What's that? What? Don't you try to threaten me, sir. Do you know who I am? I can make things very difficult for you. And I can get my boys to make things very unpleasant for you! Understand? Iskandar. - How are you? - I'm well. Please, have a seat. Nini, please do your typing in the next room. This is some coincidence. I've been trying to contact you. - Contact me? - About something important. What are you doing now? I just started a job this morning... but I was fired. However, Gafar has promised me... Why Gafar? Gafar only ever thinks of himself. I have important work. - It's particularly well suited to you. - What kind of work? You know that the revolution is not over yet. As ex-freedom fighters we must still be revolutionaries. Is that true or not? Why are you silent? It's strange. People said you had changed. But you're the same as ever. Who told you I had changed? Gafar? He's envious of me. You know, Iskandar, I was always decisive during the revolution. But that's all over. Our compatriots aren't happy to see people like us now, are they? - That's true. - Exactly! The economic struggle is even more intense... than fighting with guns and bayonets. What's the point of freedom if our rice pot is still dependent on the pity of foreigners? We must also become economically independent. We must remove all obstacles. Look at me. I've just set up this company and the foreign companies are already my enemies. They feel their position is threatened. They spare no effort in trying to topple me. Take a look at this. This foreign company wants to bankrupt me. They've given me just three days to pay half a million rupiah. And the reason? Simply because I used their money as capital. Enough about that. You'll never understand the ins and outs of trading. And so? It's like this. You go to the director of that foreign company. Tell him that if he wants to stay healthy, he must quickly change his intentions. Tell him you're an ex-freedom fighter with a direct interest in this company. And if he doesn't agree? You know what you have to do. Many of your old friends are still hanging around here - Puja, Udin and the others. And if there are difficulties? I'll take full responsibility. So that's how it is. Only you can handle this kind of work. This is all part of our ongoing struggle. Yes. Of course. I'm just the person for this work. I couldn't be more insulted than I am now. I'm always the one to perform these errands. Iskandar can be ordered to kidnap and kill people because I'm no longer of any use myself. I once killed people on your orders... and to this day I still don't know if they were guilty or not. And all those possessions we seized! All for the sake of the struggle! Why are you bringing this up now? All for the struggle? Plundering, murdering, kidnapping, all for the sake of the struggle? I'm not suggesting you do this for nothing. A thousand rupiah. I'm worth nothing to you. Still not enough? Use your money to buy another diamond ring! Was it for people like you that I fought so long? You're not the only returned freedom fighter. That's true. But at least I don't dishonor my comrades' names. Fraud. Traitor. Devil! If you want to remain honest, don't try to live here. Go back to the forests or the mountains! Decide whether you're going to take that money or not. Nini, summon my car. I'm going out. Damn it! Stupid! Come on. Play your shot. I'm going home. Iskandar, sir! Don't touch me. I'm not your wife. - Is there any coffee? - Get it yourself. How's business? Did you make that deal? He wasn't interested. Just whack him on the head. People like that should be eliminated. Hey! This man was my superior. Lieutenant Iskandar. Miss! Miss! Two coffees. Sir, buy a lottery ticket? What's this? A lottery? Here's your lottery. I've been buying lottery tickets for the last month, but I haven't won. - I don't want any. - The draw is tomorrow. Maybe you'll win. How do I know which is the winning number? It's this number, sir. - Are you sure? - Yes. I once sold a winning ticket. Watch out if you're lying. Watch out if I don't win. Why do you buy those things? I know I won't win. I buy them to have something to give me hope. It's as though... everything could change in a flash. - When did you get back? - Last night. In that case, you don't know what's good in town yet. What do you mean? Have you eaten yet? Let's eat at my place. We've plenty to talk about. Miss! This is for the coffee. Oh, when will you come My beloved? Sit down. My fate is gruesome Tears... Where did you come from? From the square. You've not been here long? Puja has only recently come here too. He used to be in the army. I arrived yesterday. Looking for someone? No. I'm not looking for anyone at all. I'm also new here. I only arrived here a month and a half ago. It's not very long. I used to live in Sumedang with my husband. Why did you come here? My husband hits me. I don't have any children yet. Laila, this man isn't a customer. He's my former superior. You only ever look at men in one way. All men are the same. We'd like to eat now. Were you in the army? Yes. I have a brother. At the moment he's... He's in the... He's in the "captain division." Hurry up and quit talking nonsense. She's crazy. But she still has her uses. She's pretty too. Do you want her? Do you live here? Yes, that's how things go. I suppose I'm like a pimp. What are you doing now? Nothing. Perhaps I won't be able to work again. No one here seems to understand me. This morning I tried working in the governor's office. People like us are regarded as rubbish now. When you've got the sugar you can throw the cane away. My job these days is playing billiards. And when that bores me, I play the lottery. It's all I remember doing for days now. Another month of it and I might go completely crazy! Why? I can't go on like this! We fought, we made sacrifices, and now we've become superfluous to people. Yet our old comrades, like Gafar and Gunawan, they're always in charge, and they're all clearly satisfied. Their only aim in life is making money. Despite that, we must not alienate ourselves from the rest of society. We must participate. That's easily said. You've only been back one night. You still have your ideals. But what about me? Isn't it ready yet, Laila? Almost. Someone's here for you. Please, wait here a moment. - Who is it? - Your friends. Come on then. - What's he doing? - He's depressed. Come on, let's play. - Watch out. - Cards! I'll strip him of everything later. Deal. Oh, when will you come My beloved? My fate is gruesome Tears stream down I am overwhelmed by misfortune When will you come My love? Damn! Where do you live? At my fiancée's house. She's beautiful. - Can I have this picture? - What do you want it for? To keep it. This is exactly what I've been searching for. What is it? I've been looking for so long. What's that for? What's this paper called? L-I-F-E. "Life." It's called Life. It's an American magazine. It's beautiful. I'll buy another copy. It's meant to be read. Does your fiancée have anything like this? Maybe. I'd love to own some of these. I have many other pictures. Look. Aren't they beautiful? Where has Puja gone? Oh, I need these pictures too. Before we were married, my man often asked me, "What do you want me to buy for you?" But back then I didn't know. I didn't have any examples. Now I'm well prepared. Do you really want to buy all of those? But one night, some months after we were married... my man went away. He never came back. That's the way men are. When they go away, who knows if they'll come back or not. In the future, I will find a good man. Maybe you would like to buy me something? I don't have any money. Oh, come on! If someone asked me what I wanted, I'd already know the answer. One only works to create a home and have a baby, like this one. Later on I'll buy a small bed. I'd love to have my own home. Laila, there's a customer out back. Is she annoying you with her fantasies? I don't understand. Why does she cut out all these pictures when she can't buy them? Crazy. Please, sit down. I just lost at cards. All this time, I thought I would get rich. We all imagine we'll get this or that. We all have our illusions. What's so different about Laila? Perhaps you're right. She always means well. She wants to get married. But then men come. She goes with them. She succumbs. But she's a woman and I'm a man. I can't stand living like this. So what do we really want? Lead us again like you used to. We'll teach a lesson to all those who are puffed up with pride! That's precisely what Gunawan thinks. Gunawan? What's he up to? He promised to pay me to threaten a company director. Well, I agree to that. And what else can we do? Who do you think we can take on? The government? What was all that fighting for? To maintain the government? Indeed, but I won't help Gunawan for nothing. When the time is right, we'll eliminate him too. No. I'd like things to be like they used to be. All of us friends, together again, fighting in battle, causing havoc! That's over. We must become ordinary people. Sure, like Gafar and Gunawan? You obviously don't know where Gunawan got his money from. Why did he order you to kill people in the past? Where did he get that money from? Tell me! Did Gafar not tell you anything about this? - Tell me where! - Maybe Gafar got some too. He knows more than I do. Where did he get it? Tell me! Come again, won't you? If anything happens, I am here. You've never thrown a party like this for me. Is Iskandar someone special? - Of course. - Why's that? He's a hero. He fought for all of us. And you? Don't get angry just because you have a lover. - Be quiet. - So where is our hero now? What time is it? 5:00. It's 5:00, All. - That's enough for today. - Right, sir. What's your connection with Gunawan? I haven't got one. Why did you tell me not to see him? I didn't want him to hurt your feelings. I can assure you, Iskandar, ever since he ordered you to kill those people, I've had nothing to do with him. Remember how I refused to accept his orders? At the time you weren't at all pleased with me. Why did you refuse? There's no point talking about it. I'd only break your heart. I know you. There's no point talking about it. I need to. What's the point in worrying about Gunawan? It'd be much better to think of the future! You can help me here. Look at what's going on here! There are several new school buildings. Hundreds more have yet to be built. Schools and housing estates for the future. I'm not getting worked up over him. But that woman's screams, accusing me of being a murderer... Or perhaps you're afraid your own secret will be revealed? All right. You asked for it. Gunawan had planned that killing for a long time. Afterwards, and I have evidence to prove this, he went into town and established his company. He had with him the money of the people who were killed. That's why I no longer have anything to do with him. What about the people I shot? They were refugees from Jakarta. They had brought jewelry with them in order to survive. They weren't spying for the Dutch. They were no more guilty than you or I. Puja, bring them out! Shoot! Do you know what Gunawan said? "We must still be revolutionaries. "The revolution is not over yet. "We must go on fighting!" Aren't there laws under which men like him can be tried? There are such laws, but there are also more urgent problems that need to be solved. So people just don't have the time? Fine. Then I will carry out the sentence myself. We don't have the right to sentence anyone. You're right. It's not our responsibility. It's mine! I'm the one whom Gunawan treated badly. Do you think my mind can rest while Gunawan is still free to commit crimes wherever he likes? Don't interfere, Gafar. This is my business. All of my friends are dead except me. What's the matter with you, Iskandar? I'm truly embarrassed for my friend in the governor's office. It was my fault. But I didn't do it deliberately. I'm not ready to work. My thoughts are still unsettled. If you wish to succeed, you must be able to adapt. Perhaps you think you have already served the country. - So... - Iskandar? The guests are waiting. What are you two talking about? This party is for you. You can't just neglect your guests. You have to be a proper host. Come on! Iskandar, don't keep thinking about it. What happened in the governor's office isn't important. There are plenty of other jobs. Norma, I need to talk to you about something. - Hey, Norma! - Hey, Zuraida! All by yourself? Where's Yus? He couldn't come. He's working until 10:00. Perhaps he'll come later. That's all right. As long as he doesn't forget. It's difficult having a police inspector for a husband. Oh, stop pretending! Hello. I haven't introduced myself yet. - My name is Halim. - I'm Iskandar. - What was your division? - I was moved around. So was I, but mostly near Cianjur, the area of strongest resistance. The enemy couldn't break through. Once we got into town, three of us... Hey, haven't I met you before? Where? Were you ever in the area south of Bandung? Zuraida, this is Iskandar, my fiancé. He's just returned from fighting. Iskandar, this is Zuraida. Iskandar. Your dress is really beautiful, Zuraida. - It's wonderful. - Thanks. Yours is wonderful too. Iskandar, please tell us about the war. There's nothing to tell. My brother has just come back from fighting. Really? Have I told you about him? He's really dashing. And he's got a car now too. Hey, Tin! Why don't you smile? For me? Norma, I... Come on, Norma, let's dance. Wait one moment, please. Can I leave my hero with you for a minute? I don't have any objections. Come on. Sit between two angels to keep warm. Hey, Tin! How about if we go for a picnic next Sunday? Where to? Anywhere, so long as we go somewhere. - How about Pangalengan? - That place bores me. Shall we go by car? You've got a new car, don't you? Why don't we use yours? Hey, Jon, you'd better get your camera. Oh, my dress. Why don't you say something, Iskandar? I didn't mean to. It's all right. You can't even see it. Adlin, I want to go home! All that fuss over a little bit of water. It's all over. Let's sing "Rasa Sayang-sayange." Sit together facing each other Throwing rocks one by one Sit together facing each other Each of us lifting our rocks This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling Up the mountain and down the mountain Stopping for young coconuts Let your mother hate me till death As long as I get a young fiancée This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling Merry is the durian tree Sweet grapes with durian taste Sleep and dream until noon Wake up crying, late for your date This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling Soft the north wind blows Pull up the sail in your boat Coyly I raise my eyes And see her far away This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling A horse lost on flat soil Along with its harness If I lose you, sir, that's all right I will have two or three of you soon This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling Off we go to Laju Island And then further to Surabaya You can forget about clothes But please don't forget me This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling From Kelor to Tumaluntung Then bathing in Lembeyen water Don't regret your misfortune And live in a peaceful world This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling This feeling, this loving feeling Hey, looking from afar This loving feeling Becak! Let's go. Are you by yourself, sir? Adlin, have you seen Iskandar? No. I haven't seen him for a while. You've been looking for him all day. Maybe he's gone out the back. Oh, Iskandar. Is Puja here? He's not back yet. Please, come in. Do take a seat. You didn't eat anything at lunch today. - Everything is ready for you. - I'm sorry. Do you want it now? There's no need, thank you. My fate Is gruesome Tears Stream down I am overwhelmed by misfortune Misfortune Where could he have gone to? I'm going to look for him. Where are you going to look? He's no longer a child. He's in trouble, Father. I feel he needs our help. The curfew begins any moment now. What you're doing is foolish. Why's it foolish? He was clearly anxious earlier. He'll come home later by himself. People will laugh if they see us making a fuss. Can't you leave your pretty friend for one moment? Go and borrow a jeep. Where are you going to look? At the home of his friend, Gafar. I know the address. Let's go. Will you buy this for me, please? It's beautiful. Have you been keeping this for long? Yes, ever since my man left me. Men are cheats. Men! When a man goes away, who knows when he will come back? Do you hate him? Why should I hate him? Later on there will be someone else to buy things for me, and everything will be all right. It'd be lovely to have a home. If you have a man, what else do you need? You have someone to look after. This is the place. Let's knock on the door. I'm sure he's not asleep yet. Good evening. Are you Gafar? - Yes. What is it? - This is my sister. She is Iskandar's fiancée. Oh, please come in. This is Iskandar's fiancée. This is my wife. How are you? Please have a seat. We came to ask you if Iskandar is here. Iskandar? He's not here. Where did he go? He left the house without saying anything. Does he have any other friends? He once spoke of... Puja. Perhaps he's with him. I met him late this afternoon. Could he be at Puja's place? Yes, yes! But it would be better if you didn't go there. It's no place for a decent young woman like you. Don't worry about that. What's his address? I'm sure he'll come home later. Perhaps, but something may be wrong. This is the address. But it would be better if you didn't go. Thank you. We'll be going now. What is it, dear? I'm worried about Iskandar. That young man could do something that would wreck his whole future. Who is this Iskandar? A friend who fought with me in the revolution. He's a good lad at heart, brave and honest. But the revolution has changed everyone. I'm just glad I've got you. Making a fantasy world for herself. Living on dreams. The longer it goes on, the more fed up I get! Well, you're all dressed up. Going somewhere? Damn all these fantasies! Iskandar! Where are you going? - To find Gunawan. - So you agree with me? - Are you coming? - Will we act? Go into action like we used to? That's what we need. There's the bell. What is it? Oh, Iskandar. Take a seat. So you've thought about it? You took long enough. Iskandar... I didn't believe your revolutionary spirit had disappeared completely. Perhaps I didn't explain myself clearly this morning. It's not easy for those who have just returned from the front line to understand the complexities of the economic struggle, what's required to change a colonial economy into a national economy in a revolutionary fashion. But enough of that. In time you will understand. This is the point of the matter. It's simple, really. How about doing it tomorrow? Where are the possessions of the people you killed? What possessions? Those you brought to the city and used as capital for your business. Have you gone crazy? The possessions of that family you killed. I killed them? You're talking nonsense. I can answer for everything that I did! Whatever happened happened during the revolution. I didn't kill anyone! I carried out those executions. But you ordered them! You were in charge, remember? Remember, this is top secret. You'll carry out the execution. Are we sure they're guilty? The case hasn't been examined yet. It's not necessary. Those who oppose freedom must be eliminated. We haven't got any medicine or food. Where am I going to get them? The revolution needs money. - Their possessions? - Will be confiscated by headquarters. There are women and children, sir. None of them must survive. The punishment for traitors is to wipe out the entire family. - Take Gafar and Puja. - Yes, sir. Let's go. I refuse. I'm giving you a direct order. I will be responsible. Responsibility. That's all I'm asking for. What am I guilty of? You killed them. You killed them. Shoot! Good evening. Can I help you? Excuse us. We're looking for a man called Iskandar. Oh, Iskandar. He was here earlier. I know you, miss. - Where is he now? - He left. Is he coming back here? When a man goes away, who knows when he will come back? May I wait for him here? Be my guest. Come on, Norma. We'll go home. No, we'll wait here. Norma, let's go home. It's not nice here. He might already be back home. Wait inside. Why did you shoot him? What good will it do? Now the police will get involved. Laila, whose jeep was that? Whose jeep was that? I don't want anything to do with this. You'd better just go. Coward! You talk too much! Do this! Do that! Always asking to be led! I didn't want you to kill Gunawan. He was still of use to us, and to many others as well. Laila, whose jeep was that leaving? This is how you occupy yourself, cutting out pictures! I've no walls left! You've pasted up so much! What's the point in destroying this woman's happiness? I'm her pimp. I can do as I please! Even people like you need to be eliminated. We're all in the same boat. Iskandar... a beautiful young woman was here just now. She wore a very beautiful dress and necklace. I think she was your fiancée. Norma? I told her to take a seat. I wish I were like her, to be loved by somebody like you. Iskandar! Iskandar! Go to the left, go to the right Go to the left, go to the right Slice the goose up into the pot Ask the lady to dance four times Go to the left, go to the right Go to the left, go to the right Roast the goose over the fire Come, sir, let us dance Go to the left, go to the right Go to the left, go to the right Dear lady, do not sit alone Let us dance Do not be morose Go to the left, go to the right Go to the left, go to the right Yes, sir, let us dance But let your eyes not wander Go to the left, go to the right Go to the left, go to the right Slice up the goose and let us party Find your sweetheart And enjoy the game of love Go to the left, go to the right Go to the left, go to the right Iskandar. Where have you been? I've been so worried. I've been looking for you everywhere. You're too good for me. I don't know what I did to deserve a young woman like you. Don't talk like that. You... You... If something had happened to you... I don't know... I don't know what I would have done. Nothing will happen to me. I just went out for a while. The atmosphere here is too stuffy. I went out to get some fresh air. Why didn't you take me with you? Norma? Oh, Yus! Is Zuraida here? Yes. I'll find her for you. It doesn't matter. Just tell her I can't stay. There has been a murder. - That's a pity. - Some other time then. Why did you run? Don't you know there's a curfew? Hey, Iskandar. It's you. Where are you going? Gafar's house. - So Gafar's here too? - Yes. Come. Let's talk. Sure. When our comrades left the army they all scattered. Take a seat. Are you working now? What's that? Oh, yes, for Gafar. Those were some times, weren't they? Why did you leave the army? You were the bravest of us all. Of course, the curfew is about to start. I'll have you accompanied home later. There's a lot of unrest about. Different sorts of movements. Answer that telephone. Plenty of people haven't stopped fighting yet. Are you enjoying life as a discharged man? Yes, he's here. - It's for you, sir. - Coming. Would you like a coffee? Sergeant, please get some coffee. Hello? From Police Headquarters? Yes, one moment. Yes? What's that? What's happened? Yes. All right. Yes. I understand. I did it. Please help me. I want to return to being an ordinary person... like you. I'm not the guilty one. He had to be punished. You decided to be his judge... and now you have killed again. I told you that you had to forget the past. Whoever isn't strong in opposing the past will be destroyed. You were unable to free yourself from the past, and this is the consequence. Gafar! I can't help you now. You're just like Puja. You're all the same as Gunawan. You act like a friend, then you betray me. In the past you ran away, and I became the victim. Don't touch me, you fraud. All of you act like friends, as long as you feel safe, but you wash your hands of me when there is the slightest difficulty. Deceiver. Traitor! Your fiancée was here earlier. Norma... is a very loyal girl. Only you are loyal to me. I will go back to you. Only you. Norma. No, don't leave! The curfew! What was that? You, stop! Iskandar. I knew him. He was a very brave man. Come on. Carry him inside. For those who have given the greatest sacrifice of all, their lives, so that we, who are still alive today, may enjoy all the pleasures of the fruits of independence. To all those who expected nothing in return.
