Please offer the other ladies first. Sure. Thank you. This one shouldn't be passed on. Oh, for sure. Thank you. Have some, please.

Thank you. Okay? S-D-D. Okay? A. Okay? That's it. Okay. I'll call you later. Yeah, yeah. Bye. Hello, Mr. Safari. Mr. Safari... I am Sara. I am Sara, Mr. Parviz's friend, your son's. He called me and... said you've not been answering his calls for a few days now. He was worried. He wants to talk to you about something. I work at a travel agency. He asked me to help you take care of your documents so that we can go and see him together. Thank you. Come on. He was really worried about you. He misses you a lot. You know how it is. He can't come back. So he wants you to go to him. You'll take a break this way. It'll be good for you. Wow, what a house you have. It's really beautiful in here. Mr. Safari, does this radio still work? It looks so cute. Oh, Polish chairs. Are they original? They must be, they look so good. You can't find them easily anymore. Everything's very first and original version is the best. Isn't it, Mr. Safari? When did he call you? Who? Last night. Come on. He was worried. Why didn't you anwer his calls? Oh, look at the kitchen. What are these? Look at these cute cups. I'm in love with your cups. Do you want me to pour you some tea? Tea? No problem. I'll pour myself some. Why don't you answer your phone? I also called you a few times. Don't you think we get worried? [weakly] It's been lost. What? The phone has been lost. What?! Is it even possible for a landline phone to get lost? It's trilling. Oh, what a beautiful room you have. Um, where's its handset? I don't know. It must've run out of power too, I presume. It's okay, we'll find it. This... has an answering machine. I'll... fix it now. I think... I have found the option. "Hi. "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message after the beep. "I'll try to call you back ASAP." Done. See? At least, now, we won't get worried about you. Now, how do we listen to it? "Hi. "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message..." Okay, good. Where are your documents? Your documents. For the passport. Mr. Parviz said you don't have one. And the working hours are already over. We'll take care of it tomorrow. Meanwhile, I'll make the required photocopies and fill in the forms for you. Is that your balcony? How cute. Hope it won't crash on us. Isn't it scary? It was flying very low. I thought it was gonna land here for a second. How cute. Your birth certificate and ID. Thank you. Do you have any photos of yourself? Must be 6x4 with a white background. Never mind. We'll go take a new one tomorrow before going to a police station. I'll come after you tomorrow at 10am. See you later. Bye. Oh, and what kind of clothes do you have? Is this okay? This one... No. It's not bad. Let's see what else you have. These ones aren't good either. These are very old. When was the last time you bought clothes? About 20 years ago. Oh, dear. It's okay. This one looks better than the others, in my opinion. Yeah, this one suits you very well, we'll go with this one. So wear this one... with this. No, no, with this. Wear these two together, okay? Wear them for tomorrow so that... we can take care of the photos, for now. We'll get a new chic set for you before the visa appointment. I gotta get going. Goodbye. See you tomorrow at 10am. Yes? How many times do you call? Okay, what happened? Okay. Didn't I tell you? Yeah. Yeah. ...we present you the next program from Tehran... "Hi. "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message after the beep. "I'll try to call you back ASAP." Hello? Sa... Sara, did I call you? Hello? "Hi. "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message after the beep. "I'll try to call you back ASAP." Hello? Dad? Hello? Dad, hi. Are you okay? I talked to Sara. She said she was there today. Hello? Dad, please pick up the phone. Please. I'm worried about you. Is everything okay? Hello? Dad, please. Hello? Yes, Dad. Hi. Are you okay? Why don't you answer the phone? Did you see Sara? I... sent you an invitation so that you can come and see me. Sara will take care of everything for you. [in Azerbaijani] Dad, are you okay? Mrs. Parvin told me some things about you. That you go out of the house a lot. Dad, take care of your documents soon and come see me. If I could, I'd come to Iran and bring you with me myself. You know I can't. You'll feel better here. She's a good girl, Dad. You'll come here together... [in Persian] Dad, please just listen to what Sara says... Hello? Sa... Sara, did I call you? Hello? "Hi. "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message after the beep. "I'll try to call you back ASAP." [Azerbaijani music playing on the radio] "Hi. "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message after the beep. "I'll try to call you back ASAP." The time is 9:44am. The time is 9... Mr. Safari. Hi. I went to the community's gate, the guards told me you're here. What are you doing here? You're late. It's not late yet, let's go. Come on, I've parked badly. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. What were you doing there? Where? In front of that house. You were late. So I came to your door. My door? Please look straight into the camera. Just for a moment. Straight into the lens. Just for a moment. Ma'am, please come stand behind the camera. Uh-huh, that's good. You're good. That's good. One... two, three. Can we have a photo together, too? Sure. Thank you. Oh. Thank you. One... two, three. Are your documents complete? Yes, we gave you the forms. Is the photo new? Yes, we took it today. He's handsome, isn't he? Of course. You haven't written down the address. Where should the passport be sent to? Please write down the address here. Does it usually arrive during the working hours? Yes. Can I have your pen for a sec? Sorry. It's better we write down my address. It may arrive when you're not home. He'll be traveling with me anyway. You on board? Hello? Hi. I'm on the way. Yeah, I swear. I told him I have family issues. Get lost! No, I... No, I wasn't talking to you. Well, hey, I'm coming. A lot of customers, huh? Okay, I'm coming. Okay. To hell with what he says! I'm coming, dear. Bye. Mr. Safari, I really need to get back to the agency ASAP. If I drop you off here, will you be able to find your way back home? I'll stop there, okay? Nevermind. I'll get you a cab when we get to the agency. That's better. What heavy traffic. Okay, come with me. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Number 106 to the cashier. Hi. I'm calling from Atlas Travel Agency. I need a cab. The destination is Taleghani Planned Community. Yes. I'll appreciate it if you send one ASAP. Thank you. Okay. You can sit down, for now. Please wait here. I'll be back in a minute. Number 107 to counter number 1. - Number 108 to counter number 1. - At your service, ma'am. Yes? Hello. Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. Do you know what time it is right now, ma'am? Why aren't you punctual? We have rules here. You have to arrive at work by 8:30am at the latest. Not at 1pm. You're in charge of the payments here. Ms. Rahimi has been doing your job since morning. Why does it have to be like this? If you can't stand by the rules... I'll have to think of a solution. I'm sorry, but I already told you I'm having some family issues. "Issues"? Everyone has issues. Go back to work. Number 109 to the cashier. You're Mr...? Shams. 4 tickets to Antalya. 8750000 Tomans. Here you are. You can charge the rest off my bank card. - Thank you. - Miss Ahmadi... what happened to the tickets for the French tourists? Please answer line 2. Number 110 to the cashier. Yes? [in French] Hello. Yes. I was the one who sent you the email. I'll try to send it again, then. Because the Internet connection hasn't been working well here during the past few days. I hope you've had a good time in Iran. Have a good trip! And don't forget to be at the airport at least 3 hours in advance. Thank you. Bye. - You're Mr...? - Mortazavi. A one-way ticket to London. Miss Ahmadi, the cab you called has arrived. - Excuse me, Mr. Hossein. - Yes? Just a sec. Can you please help this man get in the cab? - Yes. - Thank you. Just... the address... You live on block three, correct? Yeah, block three. And the number of the house doesn't matter. Here you are. This is the address. You can pay him up-front with this. And tell the driver to drop him off right in front of the block. Thank you. You can go home, I'll call you later. But only if you answer the phone, of course. - Sorry. You were Mr...? Mortazavi. - Mortazavi. I had a one-way ticket to London. It'll be 2470000 Tomans. Thank you. - Here you are. You're welcome. - Thank you, ma'am. Sir. Your card. Hi, Mr. Safari. Hi. What's up? Can you do something for me? Of course. Come in. It's not bad at all. It's... a change. And it... suits you. The color is good, too. And even if you don't like it... you can just wash it off... using ordinary shampoo after a few times. It does suit you. You have called Atlas Travel Agency. Please leave your message. "Hi." "I'm not home at the moment. "Please leave your message after the beep. "I'll try to call you back ASAP." Hi, Mr. Safari. What are you doing here at this time of night? Has something happened? Sorry. Just a moment, sir. Get in, I'll take you home. It's late. Where are you going? Pfft, nevermind. - Mr. Vazin, don't hit him! - What should I do, huh?! What are you doing?! This doesn't look good in the neighborhood. Get off him, you're killing him! He's old. - What "old"? - Get off him! - It doesn't look good in the neighborhood. - What's it to you? What's it to you? You were killing him. Didn't you promise us a few times he wouldn't come here again? Look what he's done. I'm gonna sue him now. We gotta go to a police station. Sue him for what? Honey, call the police. You know him well. I'll escort him away. And he promises... not to disturb you again. I begged him. I complained to him. I didn't say anything due to his age. I didn't say anything due to his illness. How much more of this do I have to take?! Come on. This doesn't look good in the neighborhood. 1 year? 2 years? Since the very first moment... Come on. Drink this and calm down. ...I stepped foot in this house... it's been like this for 30-40 years now. I leave in the morning. Come back in the afternoon. He's standing here with a loaf of Sangak. Sir, you're right. - Forgive him. - What should I do?! Forget about my livelihood because of this guy? 1 year? 2 years? H-How long?! How long?! Forgive him, please. Forgive him. Please go back in. Please. P... I swear, next time... whether it's morning... or night... or midnight... if he comes here, I'll stab him with a knife. - You're right. Okay, okay, you're right. - I swear I'll kill you! - Please forgive him. - I'll kill you! - Please go back in. Please. - Let's go back in. Please go back in. Please. Look what he's done. What a prick. Let's go. Let's go, Mr. Safari. Come on. It's good Mr. Etemadi saw you in the street. He told me about it. And, well, I knew where you were going. Look what that prick has done. Gotta say, it wasn't smart of you either to go there at this time of night. You know, some things happen in life... that you can't do anything about. Things that are difficult to forget about. Sometimes you just can't. You have to leave them to time. Time will take care of them. You know Dr. Jafari who lives in front of your block? He helped us with our trauma. My wife... when our child died... she couldn't forget about it. Whenever she saw a child... she'd say, "It's my child". Thanks to the Doctor... my wife could get past it after taking some pills. She couldn't forget it after 10 years. Just like you. And it's so difficult to wake Mrs. Parvin up. Oh, it's 3am. I'm gonna go to the Doctor's block's lobby to take whatever we need to patch your wounds up. ♪ You know what you've done? ♪ ♪ You've filled my heart with sorrow ♪ ♪ It's my dream to, one day... ♪ Has something happened to you? Where are you going? - Where is she? - Who? No one's here yet. - Hello. - Good morning. - Hello. Hello. Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. Hello. Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. Why have you locked the door? We're open now. Because of this guy. - Hello. - Hello. Mr. Safari. Mr. Safari, what are you doing her...? Where were you? Were you in an accident? Has something happened? Come on in. Why have you locked the door? I was worried he'd get us in trouble, ma'am. That's why I called you. I think he's been here since last night. Sit here. Sit... Mr. Hossein, can you get me a glass of water? Please sit. Mr. Hossein, can you get me some tissue, too, please? Hello, sir. - Here you are. - Thank you. Thank you. Is there a problem? Um... No, there's no problem. Maybe you should take him to a hospital? Number 73 to room number... Was he in a fight? No, I think he was in an accident. This doesn't look like an accident wound. Were you in an accident? Mr. Bagheri, please go to... Does it hurt, sir? Ms. Aaliyeh Askarpour to the nurses' station, please. Does he have ADHD? No. I-I don't know. Maybe. Ms. Boghsi... Ms. Yousefi. Mr. Boshrizadeh. Are you okay? Can you please not come to my workplace anymore? I work there. That's my livelihood. They may even fire me. You know, I really need that job. Give it a few days. When your passport arrvies, we'll go to the embassy and take care of your visa. Then, we'll go together. I talked to Mr. Parviz yesterday. He's really worried. You'll go to a doctor there and get better. They have come up with some methods to deal with ADHD there. Mr. Safari. Mr. Safari. It was difficult for me to find that job. I swear to God that even I am worried about you. Everything will be okay. Just don't come out of the house for a few days, okay? You're a dear. Don't come to my workplace anymore. I have to go back to work now. And it's best if you rest now. Please. Stop right here. - Aren't you going home? - I am. Stop. Do you need help? I can go alone. You would have gone mad too if you were in his shoes. Look how long it's been like this. But he had gotten used to it. Yes, but not in the middle of the night. Are you sure he can't remember anything? He's gotten even worse recently. He can remember some things. But sometimes, it feels like he doesn't even know me. Oh! Mrs. Parvin, Mr. Safari is sitting here. Mr. Safari, where are you, my good man? We thought you've been sleeping in your house since last night. So you were out? - You gave us a heart attack! - Were you out? Mr. Ali told me about it this morning. Come on up. Look at this. Come on. Come, let's go upstairs. Come on up. Let's go. Thank you, ladies. - You can go. - No problem. - We gave you so much trouble. - No worries. Fortunately, he's here now. Come. Mr. Ali, you can go back to work now. - Let me know if you need me. - Will do. Go. Go slowly. You constantly go out in this polluted air. And unhealthy air doesn't exactly help with one's memory. I'm brewing some Chahartokhmeh for you. It's good for your heart. Parviz called this morning. He's so worried about you. I didn't know you were gonna go see him. To be honest, it's not bad at all to get away from this unhealthy air for a while. Dear, we already talked about you not going out of the house in the middle of the night. You used to go out in the mornings and come back. That was totally fine. What'd happen if you were lost? If you couldn't find your way back, what would I have to tell Parviz? He's been able to live there a little bit more peacefully all these years with the hope that I'm here for you. Why did you even go to that poor guy's door in the middle of the night? Who's this girl that's been showing up at your door recently? The guards say she's here every day. Safari... give it a rest for God's sake. I don't have any patience this time. All these years, those poor people have been showing so much patience with you, too. I'm jealous of that woman that you haven't been able to forget her all these years. Hi. Hi, Mrs. Panahi, how are you? Thank you very much. Mrs. Parvin... I'm sorry for being late for this month's installment, I ran into a few issues. It's okay, dear. If you still need it, you can keep it for a few more days. No, thank you so much. Hopefully, it's gonna be done soon after these last few installments. No worries. Thank you. Why don't you come in? Mr. Safari is here too. No, I really have to go. - Say hi for me. - Of course. Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. It was Mrs. Panahi. She said hi. Mrs... Can I come here for dinner? Of course. I'll make some delicious soup for you. ...I'm so happy I saw him that I don't know what to do... I didn't know it was him, Mom... Wow, look at his chic clothes. You didn't say this was gonna be a formal dinner. I would have dressed up, too. Look at these flowers. What a good smell. Come on in. Come on in. Welcome. Let me go in. Boss... - It's not gonna last more than a minute. - I beg you... Grandpa. - Didn't I say I don't wanna see anyone? - Thank you. Why did you come? I'm your grandchild... I tell them over and over again... that I haven't played piano in a long time. But they don't believe me. They have started speaking very recently... and they constantly ask me to play the Iranian birthday song. Can you play me some piano, too? What? Piano. Play me some. Told you, I have forgotten how to. Play me whatever you can. Okay. Mr. Safari, where are you going? Where are you going, man? Did you tell Mrs. Parvin you were going out? She's gonna give me an earful. Mr. Safari. Mr. Mohammad, give Mrs. Parvin a call. - Hi, Mr. Safari. - Mr. Safari. He left. [Afghan music playing on the radio] - Mr. Hossein, goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. - Bye. Goodbye, Mr. Hossein. - Bye. - Goodbye, Mr. Hossein. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Didn't we talk about you not coming here anymore? What is this? What is all this? Money. I know it's money. What's it for? It's for you. For me? Did I ask you for money? Mr. Safari... did I ask you for money? I asked you not to come here anymore. And you bring me money? Mr. Safari, I wanted to help you. But you're... disturbing me now. I can't function properly at work. I even wanted to tell Parviz that I can't do this anymore. I don't want to. I don't want to go to Canada. I think it's because of me that you've gotten worse. Where did you get this from? Did I ask you for money? I never asked you for anything. I wanted to help you so you can travel, as well as taking a trip myself. You thought I wouldn't get news you've been sitting there all night? The guy who works in the building across the street told me about it. Why? Mr. Safari, what are you doing? Please forget about me. I beg you. I'll take care of your documents, we'll go to the embassy, and you'll go see Mr. Parviz. But I'm starting to get scared. Please. Mr. Safari, I beg you. I love you. I beg you. 2 loaves of special sesame-seeded Sangak for Mr. Safari. Here you are. - How many for you, sir? - 3. Go to your left. Go to your left. Come on! Hurry up! Go look inside the house. Captain. Are these yours? Captain, I found the safe inside. Cuff him and get him in the car. You haven't brought any cuffs? Okay, just escort him. Follow up on the info request and get back ASAP. Where's Bahrami? - Bahrami. - Yes, sir? Start the car and bring it here. Come on. Come on! Is this his car? - Yes, Captain. - Open the door. Is the car key in this key chain, too? There's nothing in there, Captain. Give it to me. Leave please. Please leave. You can leave, too. Thank you. You can go back to work. Go get him in the car. 40-42. Let's go. Look up the car's plate and get back with the info. So you think you can do whatever you want and get away with it, huh? That there are no laws? That there's no law enforcement? Sir, anyone does something in this city, we'll get word. You're too old. Why are you stealing? Why are you killing people?! Every morning, you go buy Sangak, you leave, you come back, you think we don't know what you're doing? Do you even eat Sangak? Why does someone who eat God's blessing kill people? Do you even know what a worthy blessing Sangak is? The Chinese have built machines for baking all sorts of bread. But they couldn't for Sangak. They couldn't. It wasn't that they didn't want to. They couldn't. Sangak is one of the original symbols of our culture. You can't find it anywhere else in the world, even in the US. Whom does Sangak belong to? Us. - You, go buy 2. - Yes, sir. The Sangak here is good. Sangak has bran in it. It won't make you fat. The fact that you've grown old while staying healthy so that you can kill people is thanks to Sangak. The hot gravel in that stone oven that bakes the dough and makes it edible has seen a lot. Has seen all sorts of people. Killers, lovers, kids, adults... Life... Life... And you had the audacity to insult bread like this? You could insult bread like this?! My late father used to perform wudu before leaving to his work at a bread bakery. Why? So that the bread he's baking is pure and clean from unholiness. The Sangak around here is famous in Tehran. They even used to perform ghusl for one loaf of it. And you people... you have the audacity to do what? To just go ahead and kill people. Be careful, Bahrami! - Hold the door! - Sir, be careful. Hold the door, sir! Help us. Come help us! Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance. What happened? What happened? Come, come, come, come, come. Hold his legs. Wait, Ali. - Help us, Imam Husayn. - His leg is stuck too! His leg is stuck! Help me. Come. Hold it. Hold on a sec. Hold on to this arm. Help him come out. Hold on. Hold on. Sir, are you okay? Sir, can you hear me? He's stuck. He's stuck. Come on, come on. 1... 2... 3. Help us, Abu al-Fadl. He's still stuck. Sir, can you hear me? Push! Can you hear me? Translation and subtites: FeralCx for KG
