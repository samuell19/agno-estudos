Can't you remember? No, I can... So, you can’t remember... Kill him. Why are you sweating? Are you okay? Mom? Yes, Jin-seok. Did you have a nightmare, son? Dad? Should've listened to your big bro. I told you to sleep early for moving day. Bro? He was so excited to move, he didn't sleep all night. We're almost there. What should we eat for lunch? Black bean noodles, of course! Great idea! Our new house. I've never seen it before, but somehow it feels familiar. As if I stood here in the past and saw the house before... Why do I get that feeling? Do you like it? Is it the house you dreamed of? My brother topped his class all through school. He graduated from the most prestigious university. He was remarkably talented in everything since he was young. He had a strong competitive spirit and was very athletic. Yes! He was also handy and good at fixing everything. He never smoked, drank, or said anything indecent. He was a logical and eloquent speaker. He was the awe and envy of everyone. Of course, i liked my brother too. No. I respected him. To a high school repeater with chronic nervous breakdowns, my brother was my pride and joy. Yu-seok! I'll take that, mom. Though his left leg became impaired in an accident last year, he’s still the perfect hero to my family and I. - Careful. - Where to? - There, please. - Okay. - Beside the post, please. - Sure. - Be careful, please. - Yes. Where do you want this? I'll take those books. There. Bro? We're sharing this room? You didn't hear? The owner before us left some stuff in the small room. So we can't use that room ever? I'm not sure. He begged and dad couldn't say no. Won't be long. Why? You hate sharing a room with me? Yup. I thought so. I knew it. Kidding. Just curious. - Yu-seok! - Yes, mom! Come down and help me? Why you! Not the head! It kills brain cells! No way! - Excuse me. - Yes? Where do you want this? - By the bed, please. - Okay. - Are you all right? - Yes. Thank you. It's our stuff anyway. That man is your older brother? Yes. Why? Really? Yes. We don't look alike. Then how old is your brother? - Why? - Mister? Someone's looking for you in the kitchen. Okay. I'm exhausted! Dinner time! Jin-seok? Like the house? Yes, mom. Really? You sure? Yes, he says he loves it. Except sharing the room. Hey! It won't be long. He said he'll take his stuff in a month. I was just kidding, dad. N 0 I you we re n't! Yes, I was. It's good. You can ask your brother questions as you study. Dad? Did he say what's in the room? Probably stuff he used. What kind of stuff? I have to warn you. Don't ever go into that room. He begged me not to look inside. Jin-seok? Are you taking your pills? - Of course, dad. - Good. What's that sound? What sound? It came from upstairs. Sounded like something heavy dropped. Wasn't it the thunder? No, it wasn't the thunder. Isn't the small room above us? Yes, it is. Wasn't it the thunder? I don't think so. - It was the thunder. - Right. I guess. The weather calls for heavy rain till morning. Good thing it's raining after we moved in. That's right. - We're really lucky. - I know. Don't worry. About what? You'll pass this time. This house has good vibes. Man. I'd better sleep. Don't ever go into that room. Bro! What are you doing? I heard something in here. - Heard what? - A strange noise. Hear it? I don't hear anything. Really? But I swear I heard something! You don't want to study, huh? No, that's not it. I heard something strange. Okay, okay. Going for a walk should help. What? It's raining outside. We'll take umbrellas. There's a park up the hill. The rain is refreshing. Bro? Hmm? Thanks. For what? You know. Why you little... Hello? Yes, dad. We stepped out for a walk. Yes. Oh, that? I'll go down and find it. Bye. - That was dad? - Yup. He needs one of my books now. I'll be right back. Wait here. - I'll go with you. - It's okay. I won't be long. Wait here. Okay. Who are you? Get him! Bro! Stay still! Bro! Bro! [07] 8911. [07] 8911. [07] 8911. Jin-seok! What's wrong? It's terrible. Yu-seok's been abducted. - No! - Jin-seok! Hey! Jin-seok! Wake up! Oh no! Kill him. Jin-seok? Are you okay? Mom? Yes, it's me. Are you okay? Where's yu-seok? He's not back yet. - Did you report him missing? - Yes. Police will be here soon to ask you what happened. Do you remember any of the men's faces? No. It was raining hard and it happened so fast. I didn't see their faces. But I definitely saw the license plate. [07] 8911. A black Van. How frustrating. That plate doesn't exist. [No, it was definitely 07] 8911. We checked all black vans in the country. No, all cars! The plate doesn't exist. - No, sir! I saw it! - Look. We checked for similar numbers, but there was no black Van. It was really raining hard that night. You could've seen wrong. You take pills for nervous breakdowns? [No! It was definitely 07] 8911! A black Van! Jin-seok... Could we stop for today? My son is not well. I think he's very startled. Okay, then. Then it was hell waiting with no end in sight. One aay... Two... A week... After two weeks, the police lost interest. My parents and i became more and more worried. Kill him. The man was in my dream every night. He seems familiar, but I don't know who he is. He's in utter pain in my dreams. 19 days after being abducted, my brother came back. But he had no memory of what happened during the 19 days. Do you remember anything at all? He had dissociative amnesia. He erased the painful memories himself. The only way to bring back his memory was waiting. Sleeping? No. We were really worried. I'm so sorry. No, I'm the one who's sorry. Sleep tight. You too. Eat the soup I made. Don't order noodles! - Mom what are you doing? Hi, bro. It's nothing. Slept well? I'm hungry. Let's eat. It's so good! Black bean noodles are the best! Bro? Where'd you go last night? Last night? You went out last night. No, I didn't go out. But I heard you go out the front door. You must've dreamt it. You were tossing in your sleep. Did I? I'd better go. - Finished? - Yup. - Clean this up, okay? - Fine. - See ya. - Bye! Bro? Yeah? What's with your leg? What? Why limp your right leg? I did? Yes, just now. Excuse me, but I'm running late. Please don't joke, sir. You're home. - Hi, son - hi, dad. Eat some veggies, not just meat. - After the ribs! - Eat your veggies. - Hello. - Hi. - Didn't eat, right? - I'm starving. - Ribs? - They're good. Hey! - Slept well? - I didn't sleep. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. I'm going to bed. Lie down. Don't sleep there. Go to sleep. And I wasn't sleeping! Goodnight. Hello. Hurry! Follow that cab, please. - What? - That taxi! Don't lose it! Hello, boss. Go inside. You bastards. Do your jobs right! I'm sorry, boss. - How many? - Two. It's enough that things got fucked up! You could've seen wrong. There was no black Van. Yes, sir. Can't you deal with the damn officers? Listen up. Son of a bitch. Why come here and make trouble? Well... I can explain. What the fuck! When boss put so much into this... Wait. I can explain. Bastard! Get him! Hey! Fuck! Stop! Where'd he go? We're fucked! But he came this way. Fuck! He's gotta be around here. Hey! You go that way. I'll go this way. Studied all night? What's wrong? Why? You're jumpy. Is something wrong? No. It's nothing. Jin-seok! Jin-seok? What's going on? Are you okay? Jin-seok? Come on. Open the door. Please? Open the door. - Jin-seok... - Get lost! Fine, I'll go. But tell me why you're doing this. I followed you out last night! Followed me? Where? You know I fell asleep as soon as I came in. I saw everything! Who were those men? They're not cops! Cops? Who are you talking about? The men who chased me! Did you have a bad dream again? Shut up! It wasn't a dream! I remember it clearly! Thought I was sleeping? Well, I was until I heard the pencil clicks! What pencil clicks? You clicked till the lead dropped! Where's my brother! What did you do to my brother! Say it! Let go! - Put it down. - Let go! Stop! - Let go! - Wait a sec. - Calm down! - Let go of me! Calm down! Calm down, Jin-seok! - Let go! - Calm down! Let go! Jin-seok! Calm down. You can't fool me! Calm down, Jin-seok! I swear I didn't go out anywhere last night. But I saw you! What about those men! Calm down and listen to me. It's not real, okay? The pencil, the cab, the men who chased you. They were all a dream! But I remember them clearly! How do you explain that? Jin-seok! Did you take your pill? Yesterday? What are you doing? It's nothing. You didn't, did you? Bro? I'm sorry. Mom will be back soon. Rest up. Okay. Hello? I'm on my way now. The cab, the men who chased you! They were all a dream! I didn't mention a cab. Jin-seok? I'm home. Mom! Yes? What's up? About yu-seokk... You mean... That really happened? It's the truth. I know it. I'd better talk to your dad. No, mom. Not yet. - But your dad should... - No, mom! If he goes out again, let's follow him with dad. Yu-seok... Your brother really did that? He's not my brother. I called many times. Come quick. There's a problem. The bastard is on to you. Yes. Right. Okay. He said that yu-seok was not his brother. Then he said he tailed you last night. He said your leg was fine and the cops were fake. But when he woke up, he was home. That's what he told me. Yes! He said that! And... Yes. Okay. I know. Right. So I think... Who's there? Jin-seok? Is anyone here? No, I clearly heard something. Did he come down? No, he's fast asleep. I checked earlier. Okay, I'll go to his room. Mr. park? What's taking you so long? Know what's going on here? Hurry! Choi is on his way too. Yo u' r e up? You sweat a lot. Way too much. Get here now. He's on to me too. Where are you going, son? Dad. Are you going somewhere? To meet a friend. Oh, really? Yes. What friend? Who are you going to meet? You don't know him. I'll be back soon. Jin-seok? You can't go. Let's go in. Let's go inside and talk. Let's go! Get him! Don't lose him! Help me! Please help me! What's with him? State your names. Yeon jae-hyung. Yeon jae-hyung? Let me get this straight. Some people locked you up for a month and you just escaped? Yes, sir. You were locked up in the big house up there? They pretended to be your family? That's right. So you thought they were your family? Is that it? Yes, that's what I thought. How were you tricked? How can anyone fool you into being your family? That's what I don't get. I don't know how I was tricked. All right, then. Got the results on his ID? Yes, a while ago, sir. Why didn't you bring it sooner! - Sorry, sir. - Give it to me. Got anything? Born April 27th, 1977, right? Yes, that's right. No one reported you missing. No crime either. So you're 40 years old, right? What? I'm 20 years old. Look, mister. How could you be just 20? It's 1997, so I'm 20 years old. Mister. See the calendar over there? It's may, 2017. The poor man... Turn the TV on. It's time for the news. Yes, sir. President moon was received as if on a state visit to the U.S. President trump held a banquet and gave a tour of the white house. Jung reports from Washington. Joint army-Navy-air force guards welcomed president moon. Come out! We need to talk. What is this? It didn't work. Who are you people? That's all you ask? Must be curious about many things. Tell me. What did you do to me? 20 years ago, on December 20th, 1997, a family was murdered in the outskirts of Seoul. In this very room. Working hard? What happened? Hi, sir. Oh my. A mother and daughter were brutally stabbed to death. It was all over the media. Even a special investigative team was put to the case. But cops couldn't catch the killer. One year, two years... As time passed, people started to forget about it. It was completely forgotten when the statute of limitations ended. But the victims' family could never forget. They hired people to solve the case. A month passed... Then two months... Seasons passed, on a spring day 4 years later... We finally found the killer. Why'd you do it? You didn't know them at all. I don't remember anything! You don't remember? No. Kill him. You're saying I'm the killer? Yes, you. No. There's no way. I know I didn't kill anyone. The bastard keeps denying it. He's definitely the killer, but he claimed he's innocent. I could sense it. It didn't seem like he was lying. The victims’ family was totally taken aback. Something was not right. They found the bastard who destroyed their lives. They want revenge, but the killer can't remember. Whether he did it alone or had an accomplice, or if someone ordered him to it... They can't kill him when he can't remember. So we brought in another expert. A former expert in hypnotic investigations. I'm park sung-dae. Let's say this is song Jin-seok's life. Divide it into childhood, teens, twenties, thirties, and forties. Why can't you open it? I don't know. Around this time, song experienced something horrific and erased the memory himself. Can you try? We tried everything to revive the erased memory. But he is suppressing it so hard. We were right. He couldn't remember. He had dissociative amnesia. The most painful memories... The bastard wiped them off himself. Right before song was involved in the case, we must go back before tragedy hit. - To when he was happy? - Right. Before may 6, 1997. Make him take barbital. It's a hypnotic agent. What an honor. Why come and see little, old me? I heard you did some acting. Think of it as a kind of role play. We'll hypnotize him to think he's traveling on a train. As he goes through each tunnel on the way, he'll go back a year to a happier time in his life. Then, let's begin. Let's go into the first tunnel. Now, you're out of the tunnel. What year is it now? What year is it? I'll ask again. What year is it? 19... How old are you? Twenty. Good. Where are you now? In a car. A car? Headed where with whom? My mom... My dad... My older brother... We're moving to our new house. What are you doing in the car? Resting on my mom and taking a nap. When I give you the order, you'll wake up from that nap. Yes. When you wake up, you'll still be 20 years old. Its the year 1997. The people in the car with you are your father, mother, and older brother. Now, when I count to three, you'll wake up from the nap. One... Two... Three! Why are you sweating? Are you okay? Mom? Yes, Jin-seok. That strangely familiar house... It's where you killed two people 20 years ago. Of course, it felt familiar. Are you okay? That man is your older brother? We don't look alike. Then how old is your brother? Why? Mister? What's that sound? Wasn't it the thunder? - We're really lucky. - I know. The fuck! Okay, okay. Going for a walk should help. We had some close calls, but everything was going to plan. To bring back a killer's memory of that late, rainy night, we set the house exactly as it was. We even had the music set to play just like 20 years ago. Mr. park dad? That was dad? Wait here. The only thing left was the killer to walk into the house as planned. But something unexpected happened. Police. You're under arrest for fraud. Cops found me right then of all times. Bro! Everything could've been ruined when they arrested me. Yu-seok's been abducted! Thankfully, you thought i was abducted. Jin-seok! Wake up! What the hell? Abducted? Call choi now! What's going on? I paid and pulled strings, then got out in 19 days. We wanted to get on with the play. But fuck! It didn't rain. It had to be on a rainy night. You started to slip out of hypnosis, and got suspicious. The bastard's on my tail. He said your leg was fine and the cops were fake. Your suspicions eventually led you to here. Get it now? Why we did it? And why you're here? What? Think I'm lying? No. It's probably true. Except one thing. What? I didn't do it. I never killed anyone. You fucking bastard! You killed them. And you'll be dead soon. In the most painful way there is. No. I'm not dying. Fuck! Son of a bitch! Turn around! Turn around now! Where did that bastard go! Faster! Step on it! Over there! Hey! Stop! Stop! What the fuck! Move the car! Shit! Are you okay, sir? Oh shit! 911? There's been an accident. A man just jumped into the street. He's breathing. - Blood pressure is normal. - Check his vitals. Can you hear me? Do you know where this is? May, 1997 Jin-seok! Jin-seok! Bro! The car is fixed! Jin-seok! Let's go! Hurry! Coming, mom! Remember my friend Jin-San? The chicken shop's son? Yes. How's he doing? He's getting married. - Really? - Yes. Jin-seok? Must be tired. Lean on me and sleep. He must've dated for a long time. His fiancé is pregnant. - Really? - Yes. Do you have a girlfriend? No. 6 months later dear citizens. Our economy is in great turmoil at present. Stemming from southeast Asian countries, the financial market crisis combined with our economic problems is amplifying the crisis. After 30 years of strong economic progress that the world envied, fast private loans no way in hell! Please, sir! Help me. Just once. Scram! I'm a high school graduate. I'll do anything. I'm really sorry. But could you pay me for a few months up front? Healthy 20 year-old in dire need of money my older brother is very sick. If you pay me up front, I'll be indebted for life. Hi, doctor. Your parents passed away and your brother's been sick for months. As his doctor, I feel terrible. I'm sorry to say this, but there's no time. He needs surgery as soon as possible. Or else we can't save him. I understand. Come to your senses! Know how scary that is? Organ donating? It's done by quacks. You'll die soon after it. Many folks even die during it. I know you're strapped for cash, but don't do it. The economy crashed. Just stay low and wait it out. Blue beard wants to chat. Will you accept? Did you mean what you wrote? Yes, I'll do anything for money. Even give up your soul? What? Why do you ask that? You need money. And I need your desperateness. How much will it take? Tell me the job first to... For the price to kill. For the price to kill. You have till noon tomorrow. Send your number, if you'll do it. If past noon, your chance is gone. - Let's go! - Wait up! Send the message? Hello?

You're home? Honey? Dear? Don't scream, please. I'll just go. Please don't scream. I'm sorry. I must've been out of my mind. - I'm sorry. - Mom? Is daddy home? No! Don't scream! Stop screaming! Don't scream! No! Wait! Don't scream, please. I'll just go. I said stop screaming! I asked you not to scream. I'm sorry! I told you not to scream! Why didn't you listen to me! Chan-mi! Don't scream! Mister? Who are you? Where's my mom? Listen to me. If you do as I say, I'll bring your mom and sister. Really? Go put the blanket over yourself. Then count to a hundred ten times. Got it? Okay.

But mom and chan-mi are bleeding on the floor. What happened to chan-mi? They're not breathing. Okay, I'll be right there. Doctor? Why? But she's family. With her sacrifice, we won't have to live in the streets. I need her insurance money. How could you do that to your family? You did it to save your brother! I did it to save my kids! But you ruined everything! My daughter is dead and your brother will die too! Now, it's your turn! Doctor? Why me? No reason! Just diel doctor! No! No! Life's a bitch, huh? Had enough? I'm sick of it too. I'll end it for you. Where's the victims' family? Why? I deserve to die. Please tell them that. Your memory is back? For what? Why'd you kill those two? Someone put you to it? By chance... Was it the woman's husband? I found out recently that he took out hefty insurance in the woman's name. Tell me. Did he order the kill for the insurance? The victims’ family wants to know. The kid you didn't kill that night... The little boy... Tell him the truth and beg forgiveness. You said you'll bring mom if I count to a hundred ten times. Know how I lived after that? My cousins took all the money. I was sent to an orphanage. I cried every night and vowed to find the man who killed my family when I grow up. Find him and get revenge! Fuck! Why didn't you kill that boy then too? Huh? Should've killed the boy, you fucker! I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Fuck! Now, tell me. Did the husband order it? Tell me! Did my dad order it? No. It was just me. I did it. Just me. Shit. I knew it. The husband taking out the insurance... It was a coincidence, right? Fuck. You expect me to believe that? Have a good life. Excuse me, sir? There's no way out that way. The elevators are this way. Forgotten Jin-seok! The car is fixed! Jin-seok! Let's go! Hurry! Coming, mom! Ks how old are you?
