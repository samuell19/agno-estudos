Northern kingdom arrived in the southern kingdom Each region experienced a major disaster. King Ye Cha captured the king of Malate and all the members royal family, and imprison them underground Under King Ye Cha's control, the Malate people lived in misery Then the prophecy arises, that this world will emerge the MuayThai warrior who will rebuild the kingdom of Malate After King Ye Cha heard the news, then ordered to close all Muaythai college places Even order to catch all newborn boys Confiscate all weapons in every house But former Malate royal official And smuggling royal ousaka weapons. This is where this story begins Do you really go home? Later I will help you prepare medicine, then practice with grandpa. Did the letter you sent, still have no reply? / You shouldn't ask that Your job is to practice. Next time, don't let me see you late again You go quickly. Don't let grandpa wait for you. Grandpa, it wasn't an exercise like this. You dream it again I'm selfish too. No need to tell you, why should you practice so hard. No, father. I'm just a little tired, that's all. I know you must have trouble yourself. You don't want to know the reason, why are you the same nightmare every day? Is that important? GuavaBerry We are the people of the kingdom of Malate. We run away from King Ye Cha. Luckily, Grandpa saved us. She is a teacher Muay Thai, and willing to accept you as a student Actually he already said, no more students will accept, but you are an exception Then you are lucky to be able to practice Muay Thai. But you must feel weird. This is only for self-defense ... but why do you have to train so hard? Today it's time to tell you the truth. You come with me. All of this started with this weapon. Dad, what is that? 9 Satra! That's our royal inheritance weapon. When the weapon is united with Muay Thai, and used by a young man ... can save the Malate kingdom from Ye Cha's hand. At that time, I had a mission. Infiltrate the palace and take 9 Satra, to prevent the weapon from being destroyed with other weapons I managed to get out of the palace, and arrived at this village. Meet your biological parents At that time they pursued Ye Cha. They risk their lives to protect you. They hide you and sacrifice. Pair this husband and wife are 2 people in your dreams. I also almost died in the hands of Ye Cha. At that time I fell into a ravine, broken bones, half paralyzed I tried hard to practice Fei He's mantra, hoping can be reunited with our brothers and sisters. But there has been no word from them. I want You replaced me with this mission Dad, what mission? You must take this weapon to the dungeon. Hand it over prince of Malate. With that prediction, save the kingdom of Malate. I know this mission is very difficult for you. Now your strength, not even strong enough to withstand hard training Your soul is also very weak. Not strong enough to withstand heavy loads. You are not born to accept this mission. Grandpa, add some more coconut. In this journey, many dangerous obstacles are waiting for you. Then the body and soul must be strong and healthy. Grandpa teaches you the best Muay Thai. You have to really practice. That's all the greatest Muay Thai moves. GuavaBerry iron kick The strongest blow. Dragon Attack! Punch on target! Survive, attack. From enduring to attack turn back. From surviving to controlling will succeed You must practice concentration. Must always be ready in any situation The body is a psychic home When you feel sick.

In time, you can use all weapon strength. Remember. In the end, your biggest enemy is yourself When you are able to defeat your demonic heart, you can only be a truly strong person The old fortune teller is you? Can not keep your mouth. Spread an unfounded prophecy Ye Cha's troops, have you been afraid to sweat? Know, my prediction, every word is real! One day, my prediction will become real. Kingdom of Malate .. ... will rise again! / Shut your mouth! You before King Ye Cha, dare to be so presumptuous! The Malate people will not forget all this suffering! A brave and strong young man will appear He was born in the year of the snake, has the power of a snake god! Able to use Muay Thai, save our people from the fire of suffering I told you to shut up shut up! / If you are a Muay Thai and 9 Satra is united, the power of youth is invincible! In time, you will die! Malate people will be free again! It seems that what I'm waiting for isn't in vain. Apparently you have to go to a place like this far away, you can only be free from Ye Cha. That seems to be the case After this battle ... Yes Cha is getting crazy. Leading the troops to attack our troops We can only survive, unable to attack. Fortunately you contacted us and got away Our troops are ready to counterattack, just wait for your referral Now my health is getting worse, it will only trouble you a young man under your upbringing, can help us fight Ye Cha Is the child ready to risk his life?

Why could be a traitor Ye Cha I'm different from Ye Cha from birth. I was actually a general, but I was framed, so I was exiled I went to the kingdom of Malate, wanting to help him from danger On the way, he met me. I'm from a royal family I see him well, let him follow me, be my bodyguard. Thank you, Prince Prince How about you? How can you come here? Even the weapon has disappeared Actually I also don't know how important it is But my family sacrificed for the kingdom of Malate. So, I have to undergo this mission Good.

I have to keep fighting My name is Asunsi My name is Ott Runny boy We must take back the holy weapon then leave / My name is Xiaolan If I hear the word pirate woman again, cut your tongue / miss, where is my stuff? Is this what you mean? Actually we don't have anything to do with this thing but Ye Cha pushed his troops to attack we. They killed my parents, arrested my brother That thing is very important for our people. Please return it to me What if I refuse? What can you do? I want to use this object to be exchanged for my brother's life He won't really make a deal. If you want to do that, won't tell us? What do you really want? You are different from them. This is ... I returned it All three of you want to go to that city? I also want to go there to save my sister You see, we work together I agree If you die, no one will say who the prince is You will feel torture. In time, your life is like death Are you still looking for the prince's existence? King, you shouldn't be here alone. Why not kill them? Quickly do it Now you can kill them, but it's better to wait after 5 days That night night of death. The year the snake will reappear. I want to use their lives ... as an offering to the god of fire. That way, the king will be stronger Now it's fully under control. No need to worry anymore But I heard, holy weapons reappeared in the world of mansia Even though there were weapons, the King of Thailand stood before me, also not my opponent! Do you doubt my strength ?! My strength is capable of destroying the human world! King, please forgive me. I only think about the best for the king Remember! Weak humans won't have a chance!

There was no time to wait for the ship to be repaired It's better to go with a small team But now there must be a lot of troops on the border. All regions are under their control I have an idea. We just go through the tunnel. My father told me about a secret tunnel to the city That's ... my birth place There is the entrance They are doing a ceremony.

You have no progress at all Ye Cha's blood is very precious. Can't be compared to the losers But it's okay, I can still give a last chance. Take him here Malata Why treat him like that?
