Timings by Bluerain_20 Hey, coward! You are pushing a brave man. Don't you know the crime history of Ranpal? Here, you will be within your limits, Ranpal. Sir, it's my mistake. Jailor, this slap will cost you a lot. Hello! - Hello, father! Oh, daughter! You! - How are you? I am alright. You will live long. I was remembering you since morning. You are lying. - If you were remembering me.. ...why didn't you call me? The matter is that.. Enough! Enough! Mr. Jailor! No need to give justifications on phone. The rest of the argument will be done face to face. And that too, today itself. Today! What a joke this is! You are in Bombay and.. Father, I have already come here. You can reach me within five minutes. What?! You have already come here. I.. I.. I am just coming. Dear, I am feeling very happy seeing you here. But why did you make the plan.. ...of coming all of a sudden? We have to take out time to meet.. ...our own people, Mr. Jailor. Nothing can be achieved by making excuses. Now, look! Even though I am a reporter of the Samadhan.. ...I have planned to meet you along with my work. Really? How is it? Your jail is the oldest jail in India. I have told the editor of my newspaper that I want.. ...to write an article on the history and the present.. ...condition of the jails made in the period of English rule. And he has given me permission. Oh, you are very clever. Father, tell me when you are going.. ...to make me visit your jail. Today, you are going to work or will you chat with your father? I will chat with my father. Then, you will spend your entire day with me. Visit the jail tomorrow. Mr. Sharma, where should we start from? Let's start from that barrack. What is this? - This is the kitchen. Then, we will start from here. - Let's go! Is such kind of food provided to the prisoners? Yes, dear! 250 gram rice and 500 gram pulses daily! And 110 gram mutton on every Tuesday. The prisoners get food three times daily. And we prepare all this food by the prisoners themselves. He is the jailor's daughter. - What?! Mr. Sharma, what is the furnace for? This is the furnace for preparing chapattis (leavened bread). There are two furnaces like this.. Let get off me! Let get off me! No! No! Let get off me! Let get off me! No! Save me! No! Let get off me! No! Lakshman had drawn the line to save Sita. But he couldn't stop Ravan. Father! The way you were beating that devil yesterday.. ...how furious you were! Vishal, yesterday I read your files. After reading them, I don't believe that you are a murderer. You must have come under some pressure.. ...and taken the blame on yourself. I have murdered. I have murdered not one person.. ...but four persons. And I don't feel sorry for that. I am very satisfied. But what has forced you to commit such a big crime? What will you do after knowing my story? I am a journalist. Whatever you have gone through and.. ...whatever has happened to you, through my articles, I.. You want to make my story the medium.. ...of your profession. You want to earn fame. No, Vishal! There is nothing like this. Please! I don't want to recall my past. Why? After all, why are you forcing me? I have forgotten all that with much difficulty. I just want to know this as a friend. Perhaps, you haven't made any relationship with me. But I have made a relationship with you. Relationship of friendship! You have saved me from a big accident. Can't I share your sorrow? If you don't want to tell anything, I won't pressurize you. I am going to Bombay today. Listen! Till now, I haven't told about my past to anyone. Perhaps till now I haven't got anyone.. ...whom I can tell about my pain. But I.. My life was very colorful. There were hopes and dreams. You haven't worn any garland of flowers. You haven't worn any necklace of pearls. You haven't even applied any make up. Even then, how beautiful you are!' You are so beautiful. You haven't worn any garland of flowers. You haven't worn any necklace of pearls. You haven't even applied any make up. Even then, how beautiful you are!' You are so beautiful. My heart is filled with love. My body is filled with love. My life is filled with love. Because you are my husband. Because you are my husband. Your youth is your make up. This is also your jewelry. Your youth is your make up. This is also your jewelry. You are the freshness of the flowers. Your simplicity is incomparable. The atmosphere becomes fragrant, when you walk. The atmosphere becomes fragrant, when you walk. When you speak, it seems as if the Sitar is being played. You haven't worn any garland of flowers. You haven't worn any necklace of pearls. You haven't even applied any make up. Even then, how beautiful you are! You are so beautiful. Your body is real gold. Your smile is real pearl. Your body is real gold. Your smile is real pearl. Your lips are like the tavern. You are the light of appearance. Your face is like an idol. Your face is like an idol. I want to see it again and again. You haven't worn any garland of flowers. You haven't worn any necklace of pearls. You haven't even applied any make up. Even then, how beautiful you are!' You are so beautiful. My heart is filled with love. My body is filled with love. My life is filled with love. Because you are my husband. Because you are my husband. Rita! Rita! Sorry, brother-in-law! You had to wait. Come on! Let's go! Hey, stop! What have you worn to go to the college? Sister, it's very good, isn't it? This is my new dress. I had purchased it yesterday only. Is it a dress or a swimming costume? I think the more you grow up the smaller.. ...your dress becomes. Sister, again you have started giving lectures. Oh, this is fashion, sister. Brother-in-law, please persuade her. Priya.. - You shut up! Sorry! Sorry! I think this honest one will get trapped.. ...between the sis-in-law and the wife. Brother-in-law, look at the watch. We are getting late. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! See you! Hi! - Hi, Rita! Brother-in-law, he is Tony. Tony, he is my brother-in-law. Hello, Tony! Let's go! We are late for the class. - Okay! Bye! See you! - See you! Bye! Listen, you always come late. Yes, I am late. - But, you are looking very good, Rita. Thanks! - Hi, everybody! - Hi! I am not getting sleep because of Rita. She is wonderful. But she doesn't allow anyone to touch. If she comes to my birthday party tomorrow.. ...all our wishes will be fulfilled. I will do the arrangements for it. - How? All of us will have the fun. But we will do it in the name of Tony. Check it out! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Wow, what a party! What a party! - Amazing! Hi! There! Hello, guys! - Hi! -Sweety! Bobby! Rumy! You know all three of them, right? - Hi! But this is the birthday boy, Junky. Many happy returns of the day. Thank you. Can the birthday boy have a dance with you? Sure! Why not? Hi, guys! - Hey, Tony! How are you? Hi! - Fine. - Tony, you have enhanced the shine.. ...of the party by bringing Rita. But, do all of you remember your promise? Yes, of course! Look, it's ready. It's great, guys! It's great, guys! -Go, go. Go inside. Come on. Go inside. Okay, I am just coming. You got to move it with the dance of joy. Into the rhythm.. Into the rhythm.. Don't put more. Otherwise she will become senseless. Oh, this is the only way to have control over this girl. Yes, my friend! Otherwise she won't even allow touching. Really! Then, put two more capsules. - Hi! - Hi! Hi! Have a drink. - No, thanks! I don't drink. This is not alcohol. - It's a soft drink. Have it! - Go on! Okay! - I have to go now. No offence. I hope to go with the tribal dance. Getting to it! Getting into it! Getting into a trance! You got to move it. - Where is Tony? He has gone to the bathroom. Shall we dance? So get into it. Get into the trance. This is the rhythm of the travel. You got to do the tribal dance. You got to do the tribal dance. Tony! Where is Tony? Where is Tony? Leave me! Leave me! Tony! Leave me! No! No! For the sake of God, leave me! No! No! Tony! Tony! Tony! What happened in the party last night? What happened with Rita in the party, Tony? I am sorry, sir. I am sorry. They have trapped me. Who were they? They had intoxicated Rita. And after that, she was just crying and screaming. What are their names, Tony? Tell me their names. Tony, what are their names? And now, my last question to the eye-witness. Tony, tell me who amongst these four decent boys.. ...has attacked Rita first. Is he Rumy, Sweety, Bobby or Junky? He is.. He is.. The eye-witness doesn't have proper answer.. ...of any of my questions, My Lord! Your witness, please! My Lord, the silence of my witness.. ...shouldn't be misunderstood. According to the post mortem report.. ...Rita had been assaulted physically. Tony, if you were present at the spot of accident.. ...why didn't you answer the questions.. ...of the defense lawyer? Weren't you present there? Were you present there or not? I was.. In another room. You were in another room! What were you doing there? Were you consuming drugs there? What are you saying, Mr. Lawyer? This physical assault took place at the presence of Tony. You sit down. Let me do my work! Please, you sit down. Order! Order! Tony, you have a habit of consuming.. ...cocaine, hashish, brown sugar, etc. Yes! According to the reports, Rita had also consumed drugs a lot. Whatever I am saying, is it true or not? Okay, Tony! You had taken Rita to the party, is it true? Yes! Both of you wanted to get married. Is this also true? - Yes! You have assaulted her. Is this also true? Yes! No! No! My Lord, whatever has happened to Rita.. ...it has happened with the consensus of both of them. In order to enhance their lust, they consumed drugs. Rita Sinha has also died of the poison of the drugs, My Lord. It's not because of the physical assault. This is not true, My Lord! To save these boys, he is weakening this case. My sister was a decent girl. Order! Order! All of you keep quiet and sit. My Lord, I don't want to prove the false as truth and.. ...be responsible for the death of these innocent people. Now, you give the judgment. The court has reached at the conclusion that.. ...the allegations that have been brought against.. ...these boys in the case of Rita Sinha's physical assault.. ...are false, wrong and baseless. Therefore the court acquits all the four boys. And sentences Tony for three months of imprisonment.. ...for filing a false case. I am coming, Vishal. Greetings! Why have all of you come here? To do justice with you. We are not happy with the judgment of the court. The court hasn't done well by acquitting us. Now, we will have the real fun. I am telling you not to come forward. Stop! I am telling you not to come forward. Otherwise I will kill you. - We have stopped. Don't come forward. I am telling you. We will not move forward. Stop! Stop for the sake of God! Stop! Let's go! Fast! Priya! Vishal! Priya! What happened to you, Priya? Who did this to you? Rita's murderers! They should be punished! Priya! Priya! But you have done an excellent thing, Khanna. Though you were the public prosecutor.. ...you have turned the entire case. And you have also proved the witness as the convict. That's why this servant takes whatever he asks for. Who is there? Run away! You! Taking the confession of the accused into consideration.. ...this court convicts Vishal Agnihotri for the murder.. ...of the Bobby Singh, Rumy Grewal.. ...Sweety Bhagwat and Jagiit Chopra. And under the section 302 of Indian penal code.. ...he is sentenced to life imprisonment. A big injustice has been done to you. Whatever you have done, you were helpless to do it. You didn't have any other option. By putting you behind these bars like this.. ...you have been tortured more. Now, what do I have in the outside world? I don't have any aim in my life. Time is the biggest healer, Vishal. Even if you want, you can't separate yourself from this world. I will bring the story of the injustice.. ...done to you before the society. I will try my best to make you free. What are you publishing daily, Roma? What are you publishing? A murderer who has been sentenced.. ...to life imprisonment, how can he be innocent? Because of you, our newspaper.. ..Is getting defamed. Mr. Jindal will terminate me. But I will tell him clearly that I don't have to do anything.. ...with these articles. And you face the fury of Mr. Jindal. Mr. Siddiqui, it's sir's call. Tell him to call in the evening. I am telling.. - It's Mr. Jindal's call. - What?! - Yes! Oh! Oh! Good morning, sir! Good morning, Mr. Jindal! Roma is sitting in front of me. And regarding the article about Vishal Agnihotri.. ...I am shouting.. What?! You have given Roma permission! And there is a very good response from the public. And the newspaper is selling very well. Yes. Shall I tell it to Roma? Yes, I am telling her just now, sir. Thank you, sir! Mr. Jindal has congratulated both you and me. And your appointment has been fixed.. ...with the commissioner. Ms. Roma, why are you making a murderer.. ...like Vishal Agnihotri a hero? If you want to write anything, write about me. The court has convicted Vishal. He has also been sentenced. Sir, can I get that file? Yes! Mr. Jindal had called personally. That's why I will definitely have to give you that file. But for that, you have to meet inspector Amar Saxena. Because he has the criminal record of zone no. 3. Where can I meet Amar Saxena? Though he is always busy on duty, but you can get perfect.. ...information about him from inspector Kashinath Sahu. And where can I get Kashinath Sahu? Stupid, haven't you ever seen a girl? Hey fatso, go and order for a cold drink. Then, whatever you want to see, I will show you. What will you show? - Go! Go! Yes, I am going. I am going. - Bring it immediately. Hey, what do you want? Who are you? I think you don't know me. If you had known me, you must have given.. ...your chair to me to sit. Thank you! - Sit! Many shrewd people of the Golchowki work for me. Hey, I don't have to do anything with.. ...whoever works for you. Understand! Why are you getting angry? Look, I am a woman. If I also get angry, it will cost you a lot. Have the cold drink! - I don't drink. Please, have it! - Oh, I don't drink. Okay! Look, this is one lakh rupees. I was purchasing goods from Hiraputti. - Hiraputti! But there were a lot of problem in the goods. The customers used to complain a lot. And Champarani can change her man but not her customer. Please, drink the cold drink. Okay, give me the cold drink. If you insist, I will drink the cold drink. Hey, do you need stuff for one lakh rupees? Okay! When I make a new deal, at first.. ...I give one hundred rupees. It's an auspicious reward. Okay! Okay! Okay! Come on, give it to me. I am taking this stuff for one lakh rupees only as a sample. If the customers like it, I will take stuff.. ...for one crore rupees. Do you know how much one crore rupees is? It's one hundred lakhs. It's ten million. One crore! O I see! Then your name is Champarani. - Yes! You are from Golchowki! - Yes! Many shrewd people work for her. - Leave it! Champarani! This is your reality, right? O my God! Which one is this? Oh, I have been trapped. I mean I am gone. Look, brother Irfan. It's not my fault. You know our smart inspector. He has told me to come here. I am on duty. I won't lie. I mean I don't lie. He has sent Kashinath Sahu to a danger. Hey, stupid! Even though you are a normal policeman.. ...you tried to deceive Irfan. Don't move forward. Look! Look, the policemen do have prestige. Hey, fatso! Don't you have mother and sister at home? I am like your sister. I mean like your brother. I mean.. Hey, Irfan! Hey, Irfan! You are like my son. Will you shoot your mother? Will you shoot your mother? Stupid, will you shoot your mother? Look, your father has arrived. Irfan, go and sit in the jeep with all your associates. He has come to arrest Irfan! Hey, no! No! These people have taken my drape. These people have taken my drape. Inspector Amar Saxena has come. You.. Lock him! She is very strong! Hello! I am Kashinath Sahu. Sorry, I kept you waiting. Kanti Kumar, have you offered madam tea or coffee or not? She has already taken six to seven cups of tea. She has been waiting for the last six hours. Oh! Sorry, I kept you waiting. She hasn't come for you but for Mr. Amar. You should have told me earlier. You just.. She has come for you. Yes. Sir, she is Roma Singh. She is the assistant editor of the Samadhan. She has come to meet you. I liked your style. - What?! I felt very good to see the uniform.. ...on the right person for the first time. Tell me what I can do for you. You can do a lot of things if you have the intention. I have come to take the file of the murder case.. ...regarding Vishal Agnihotri. Commissioner has sent me. Come here! The girl is dialing the number. But sir isn't receiving it. I don't even miss a wrong number. Sir won't be enticed by her. He is very honest. You stand straight. - Okay! Can I get that file? Why? Why do you have interest in that case? I am studying this case. I want to set Vishal Agnihotri free from the jail. Don't you journalists have anything else to do? - What?! What will you do with the file of a murderer.. ...who is already going through his sentence? I have got it. I mean I have met you. Okay! Okay! I am giving you the file. This is one lakh rupees which these people had used. Please count it. - What are you saying? To count the money is to doubt.. ...the honesty of brother Jibran. Sir, this is a matter of money with this type of people! I will count it. No, no, sir! Let me count it. I am not exactly doing anything. And by the way, I am very expert in counting. Close your mouth. What's the need of doing all this? You shouldn't be in the police department.. ...but in some drama company. I have the same plan after retirement. Bhawran drama! If you continue to do this, the public will replace the.. ...police station's board with a drama company's board. Wow, sir! You have said a wonderful thing. Leave it, sir! It happens. Sometimes police gets something in suspicion too. Uncle, you do something with that inspector. Oh, there is no need of it. He will change automatically. It's because he is newly appointed. You know a new bride looks at her nose ring again and again. Wow, sir! You have said a wonderful thing. Then, can we take him? With pleasure! Will I provide you with a car? No, sir! Thank you. - If you tell me, I will drop them. Please come, brother Irfan! - I don't need your favor. Okay, uncle! - Greet brother on behalf of me. Okay! I will tell him to call you. Wow, sir! The person who should arrest.. ...the criminals shakes hands with them. Amar! Yes, sir! I am right. Because of the support of police.. ...people like this get encouraged. The man who you are release, this one.. ...this person is doing the business of death. Have you listened to him? - Go! Go! Sir! - You people go. Calm down! Calm down! - Sir! Please, calm down, Amar! Brother Irfan, forget about those balls. And greet brother on behalf of me. Please come. In our business, we should be very cautious. Whose fault was this? How did police get inside? Who was at the gate? I was there, sir. He had dressed like a woman. That's why I had mistaken. I couldn't recognize him. I have committed this mistake. Please, forgive me, sir. In our business, nobody is forgiven.. ...after committing a mistake. Amar! - Yes, mother! You know you have kept someone.. ...waiting for two hours. Mother, I had been to raid. When I see your hard work, I remember him. By the way, I have heard you are earning.. ...a lot of fame in the department. You wanted this, didn't you? - Yes! Are you happy? I am happy. But I have one complaint against you. What is it? - Nowadays, you don't tell me everything. What have I hidden from you? It's about us. You! I mean how come you are here? Don't pretend to be so innocent. Roma has told me everything. What has she said? I haven't told some of the things. Mother, I have met her a day back. Liar! - Who is a liar? His father was also like him. He was a strict police officer. But where I was concerned, he used to keep mum. Mother, whatever you are thinking, it's not like this. Oh, why are you so perplexed? Roma is an educated and organized girl. The problem is that she is much more educated than me. Okay, aunt! I am leaving. - Okay! By the way, Amar, I have come to thank you.. ...for giving me Vishal Agnihotri's file. And I also wanted to tell you that I have found out.. ...the eye-witness Tony of that case. Bye! - Bye! Because of the attempts of Mr. Jindal, people from.. ...police department, judiciary and ministry level are taking.. ...part as jury members in the conference. Hmm. Mr. Siddiqui, in today's special meeting, some verdict.. ...should come out in Vishal Agnihotri's case. Let's go! There is no time. We should leave now. But Mr. Jindal hasn't come. - He will come.. ...to the meeting directly. You come. But why hasn't Mr. Jindal who is very punctual reached till now? Oh, he is a newspaper person. He will raise the issue first. Then he will come to see the drama. It's the nature of the police and politicians.. ...to raise issues, commissioner. It's better if you keep me away from your nature. Excuse me! Please come! Are you blind? - What?! Are you blind? - No! Then, why are you holding my hand? - Sorry, sir! I don't need anyone's help to find my seat. Let the proceedings begin! Call Tony! Come, Tony! Tell the truth to these people. Tell them whether those people.. ...had maligned the self-respect of Rita or not. This is true, sir. All four of them have done it in the party. They had intoxicated Rita without her knowledge. And then, they maligned her self-respect. They had.. Given me overdose of drugs.. ...without my knowledge. I was helpless, sir. I couldn't do anything.. ...to save her. I couldn't do anything. Then, why didn't you give the true statement in the court? They had threatened me to kill me, sir. I was afraid of them, sir. That's why I didn't say anything in the court. I kept mum. I was afraid of them, sir. I was afraid of them. It's all, Tony. You wait outside. Go! Ms. Roma, how can you prove that.. ...Tony was lying earlier and now he is telling the truth? What does false and truth of the person.. ...who isn't in his senses mean? Excuse me! I have the answer to your question. This is the statement of public persecutor Mr. Khanna. And his criminal record too. Mr. Khanna was acting as a public prosecutor in the court. He took the side of those four rapists. He had received bribe and turned this case. Mr. Khanna is in jail since the last one year. And many cases like this have already been proved against him. After reading this, you will come to know.. ...how the protectors of law had received a bribe.. ...and set the criminals free. Justice was not being done in the court. A game was being played. The maligning of that girl's self-respect was made fun of. Commissioner, you also make sure.. ...to read the confession of the offender of the law. Mr. Jindal, why do you always attack me? If all of you want, set Vishal free. We handle 36,000 criminals in the city. One more criminal will be added to the list. We will have another appointment. Set him free! - You are absolutely wrong. Vishal isn't a professional criminal. After being set free, he will also start living like a normal man. Yes, but who will give guarantees.. ...that he will live like a decent man? Commissioner! The biggest guarantee.. ...of a human being is his own ethics. When someone is appointed as a policeman.. ...who gives the guarantee of their efficiency? One soldier sacrifices his life while performing his duties. And another becomes the offender of the law. Are you saying anything to me? No! No! You are amongst the martyrs, right? Mr. Jindal, with the statement of public prosecutor Khanna.. ...it is proved that Tony is telling the truth. Mr. Khanna has made justice and law ashamed.. ...with his crime. It is clear that all four of those boys.. ...were guilty and criminals. Due to lack of proper witness and evidence.. ...the court has to acquit them. But this case is absolutely different.. ...from those of Vishal's murders. This case is not different, esteemed judge. Vishal's motive to murder begins.. ...from this wrong judgment of the court. Only after the helplessness of the court.. ...Vishal's compulsion began to murder. If it's punishment is life imprisonment, then.. ...everyone related to this case should get this punishment. Because of them have murdered the justice. Your honour, I agree with Mr. Jindal. In my opinion, Vishal should be set free from the jail.. ...and given an opportunity to live like a normal citizen. The rest of Vishal's tenure should be taken back. Really an injustice has been done to him. The way Ms. Roma and Mr. Jindal have presented.. ...the case, after considering that I have come to.. ...the conclusion that the circumstances.. ...which Vishal faced and because of which.. ...he committed a serious crime like murder are.. ...the result of the shortcomings of our system. That's why it's necessary to give Vishal's case.. ...a different point of view. And according to your opinions.. ...I will give the report to the law ministry. And I hope Vishal's release orders will come very soon. Thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Is there any special news in the newspaper? Oh, Roma! When have you come? You are lost so much that you don't even know.. ...when I have come. I am just reading your news. Yours and Mr. Jindal's name has been published.. ...in every newspaper. How nice! You have made a murderer get released. Congratulations! You are not congratulating from your heart.. ...but only with words, Amar. Really? - Yes! How can you be so sure about my inner feelings? I am your friend. Your eyes express your inner feelings. Only the perfect beholder is required. Have you read anything? Madam, it's better for us to perform our police duty.. ...than to do such studies. Okay, fine! I am giving you a police duty. One girl is going to commit suicide from the fourth floor.. ...of an under construction building in Versova society. If you reach there right at eight o'clock tonight.. ...maybe you can save her. Sprinkling rain drops. Sprinkling rain drops have ignited passion. When the passion has got ignited.. ...my heart longed to meet you. When I longed to meet you, I got tempted. Now you only tell me, O my love, what can I do? I was remembering you a lot. I was remembering you a lot. That's why I called you making an excuse. The rain has arrived. What can I do? Sprinkling rain drops have ignited the passion. When the passion got ignited.. ...my heart longed to meet you. When I longed to meet you, I got tempted. Now you only tell me, O my love, what can I do? I got drowned in the banks of the river. I got drowned in the banks of the river. You entered my heart just like lightening. The atmosphere is so romantic. What can I do? Sprinkling rain drops have ignited the passion. When the passion got ignited.. ...my heart longed to meet you. When I longed to meet you, I went mad. I am not in my control, what can I do? Vishal, your release is a historical judgment for the law. I am sure you will forget everything.. ...and live like a normal citizen. Sir! Sir, Roma has made me get released from here. But, where will I find my life outside? Sir, Mr. Vishal! Oh! Hello, Vishal! - Hello, Mr. Jindal! Desai, you may go. - Okay, sir! Vishal, everyone is talking about your release. Yesterday, even in the assembly.. ...some people raised a question about it. Anyway, whatever may have happened.. ...I am very happy to see you before me. I mean feel you before me. Congratulations for getting released, Vishal. Sir, I don't understand why you people.. ...have done this with me. Neither I have any relationships.. ...nor do we know each other very well. No, Vishal, no! It's wrong to think like this. I have a very special relationship with you. This relationship was formed on the same day when Roma.. ...had presented the details of your case before me. A young man of 24, who is busy.. ...dreaming of a colorful life! One wife and her sister! One house and one small courtyard! All of a sudden, everything gets destroyed. He kills not one person but four persons.. ...and becomes a criminal! Vishal, I also have a pain just like this. After knowing about you, I recollected that pain again. I have also lost my wife who was.. ...more than life to me and my eyes as well. Pooja! Her personality was just like her name. She was a social worker. She was against drugs. The drug dealers.. In front of me.. She died on my lap. How has all this happened? Pooja with a smiling face has got imprisoned.. ...in a frame and has been hung on a wall. Sir! - I am sorry, Vishal. I am sorry. But those people are still alive. The drugs business is prospering. Nobody dares to speak against them. Neither the police nor the law and not even the leaders. All of them are just keeping mum.. ...and watching this drama of destruction. How long will it go on, Vishal? Won't anyone start the revolution? Vishal, I want you to start this revolution. - What?! Yes, Vishal, yes! You will have to start this revolution. Because I am sure you can do it. - But Mr. Jindal, l.. Vishal! Don't misunderstand me. Whatever I want you to do, it's not to avenge Pooja's death. But Mr. Jindal, now I can't kill anyone. Whatever I have done earlier, I was compelled to do it. You have killed those four boys but you haven't.. ...punished those who are guiltier than those boys. The drug they were intoxicated with.. ...who has provided them with that? They are real criminals. And till those scoundrels will be alive.. ...this game will continue in this city. I have seen this city and the inhabitants.. ...of this from very near. Mr. Jindal, you have definitely done me a favor. But I can't give you what you ask for in lieu of it. It's not my fault. It's your fault. You should have decided it earlier. 'Please persuade her, brother-in-law!' 'Priya.. - You shut up!' 'Sorry! Sorry! I think this innocent person will get.. ...trapped between wife and sister-in-law ' 'Support her as much as you can ' 'When she will face difficulty, you will get to know ' 'Rita Sinha has also died due to the affect of drugs, My Lord ' 'Those four guys ' 'Get them punished ' 'Priya!' 'You killed those four guys.. ...but you haven't punished the people who are sinners ' 'The drugs business is prospering ' 'Nobody dares to raise voice against them ' 'Till those scoundrels are alive.. ...this game will continue in this city ' 'Someone should start the revolution. ' 'You are that person. ' Jibran and Tyson, both of them are the roots.. ...of all the crime taking place in this city. They are dealing in drugs. Earlier they were doing it together. But now, there is a very big clash between both of them. You will have to find your success.. ...between the clash of both of them. You have to uproot their identity.. ...and their business from the world. Desai! - Yes, sir! From these files, you will get their photographs.. ...and come to know everything about them. And I don't think it's necessary to guide you.. ...about how to get the job done. Whatever you want for this mission in terms of money.. ...weapons, anything, you can get it from Desai. And Vishal, from now onwards we won't meet here. Alright? Desai will tell you about our new spot of meeting. Okay, sir! You don't worry. I will definitely complete this mission. I am sure, Vishal, God will help you. I wish you all the best. Thank you, sir! Thank you. And listen, Vishal, the most important thing. In the last page of that file, you won't find a photograph. He is that person whom you have to kill at the end. He is such a person who pretends as if he doesn't.. ...know anything, even though he knows everything. He has given supports to the criminals.. ...like Jibran and Tyson. The crime is increasing under his tutelage. He is at the highest position in the police. But he is leading the society towards crime. He is police commissioner Kamdev Kulkarni. People are dying of drugs and the police is not doing anything. What do you mean by this? Huh? What can police do? Nowadays, the youth search.. ...for their life in poison. Then, what can the police do? Oh, brother! If the goat goes to the butcher's house.. ...then, who can save him? How nice, sir! What a wonderful thing you have said! Sir, by thinking like this, we want.. ...to ignore our responsibilities. The poison that's getting mixed up with.. ...the blood of the youth of today.. ...it can take our country towards a terrible future. Dear, this kind of speech seems good.. ...from the lips of the leaders. By the way, why will we take the responsibility.. ...of the future of the country? Huh? Half of my life has been spent in reaching at this position. Now, only half of it is left. If this half is also spent in remands, warrants, courts.. ...and dates, what will we get? Nothing! You are absolutely right, sir. What was my father? - What? He was an oil seller. What? - My father got me educated by selling oil. And he has even made me get a certificate. Sir, even though I had the certificate, I didn't get a job. I gave bribe. Only after that I got this job. Shut up, Kashinath! Shut up! - Sorry, sir! Sir, I have made a plan with the help of which I can arrest.. ...all the criminals related to the business of drugs. But till now, you have been trying for the same, Mr. Amar. This time I won't try. An operation will take place, sir. And I will have to perform this operation secretly. To remove the mask from the faces of some people.. ...I have to wear a mask. Happy birthday, Mr. Jibran. Thank you, Mr. Patel. Thank you very much. Happy birthday, Jibran. Come, Tyson, come. Welcome. What do you say, friend? Haven't I surprised you by coming here? Since morning, this friend's heart was eager to wish you. But the dark mind under the white hair was stopping me. What can I do? It's a dirty mind. Tyson, by coming here, you have proved.. ...that friendship still exists within our enmity. Look, what I have brought for you? Irfan! - Yes. Call the bomb squad. Maybe Tyson is giving me death instead of a gift. Dirty mind! A bomb is not required to kill an evil person like you. But another bomb is required. Happy birthday, Mr. Jibran. - Thank you. Our big brother has a big heart. He shares everything. Tell me whether you will open the gift over here.. ...or in a lonely room. Tyson, we have cracked enough jokes. Now, let's go inside and talk business. Tyson, we are old friends. In our youth, we were even doing business together. There was no such root of enmity between us. But nowadays, your tricks have definitely drawn.. ...a line in between. No, Jibran! You had started applying tricks first. By gobbling my stuff worth crores on the Gorai beach. You have also got associated with Brigeda of Mauritius.. ...and made me face a loss of two crores. If you mess up with me, this will only happen. Look, this enmity will end up only.. ...when we will divide our area. This is right. Otherwise we will keep fighting like dogs, and.. ...someone else will take advantage of it. By the way, this dirty mind has given this suggestion earlier too. Okay, I agree with your suggestion. The west is yours and east is mine. Okay, Jibran! In the east and west of both of you friends.. ...where will I stay, darling? Flora darling, a girl just stays in the heart. Dirty mind! You people have fun. I am just coming. Hello.. - Come on, let's go. - Uncle. Hello! Yes, Mr. Mata! Yes, I am Jibran speaking. Okay, you send your man there. The deal will be finalized there. All my business is managed by my nephew Irfan. Then, next Saturday, at nine o'clock in the night.. ...at Quiz night club, right? Okay.. Jibran is going to do a very big deal. If we arrest him red handed, at least one chapter.. ...of the crime world will be ended. But the problem is that how we can go.. ...to his private night club. Kashi! - No! No! Don't look at me like this. At first, you will send me as a scapegoat, and.. ...when I will be about to be beaten up.. ...you will make an entry just like a hero. In your heroism, I will be finished one day. No! No! Not me! - Don't worry, Kashi. I have made a splendid plan to enter into the club. Congratulations, sir. She has made.. ...a plan to get both of us into trouble. Congratulations. - Shut up, Kashi! You are always getting scared. Amar, in the duet of both of us.. ...he will also turn into a good singer. What do you mean to say? You won't understand this, Kashi. Roma, you are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are not in your senses. You are not in your senses. You are also in your youth. You haven't.. Any fault in it. All the time you are intoxicated. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. Your name is lover. Your name is lover. Your job is to deal with hearts. Don't hold.. My hands. You are fully defamed. You are a splendid item.

You are just like a silk thread. You are just like a silk thread. Seeing your gait.. Your tresses steal the hearts. It's just like the splendid black clouds. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. My heart is hidden in your eyes. Please, become my girl friend. My heart is hidden in your eyes. Please, become my girl friend. Don't hit me with your eyes. Don't hit me with your eyes. This will pierce me. Don't think.. It is easy. This love is very difficult. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are not in your senses. You are also in your youth. You haven't any fault in it. All the time you are intoxicated. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. Your name is lover. Your job is to deal with hearts. Don't hold my hands. You are fully defamed. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. You are a splendid item. Don't move. Otherwise I will shoot you. - Inspector Amar! Come on! He is dead, boss. Heart failed! Excuse me, Mister! Vishal Agnihotri! What are you doing here? What does a person do in a bus? It's not my habit to do anything illegal. I have a ticket. By the way, my stop has come. Excuse me! I am telling you, brother, inspector Amar has done this. He has only killed my son. - You don't worry. Irfan's murderer will be revealed very soon. I have found a useless and worthless pawn.. ...amongst police who will be very useful for us. Greetings, sir. Greetings! Sir, I am very happy that you remembered Kashinath Sahu. Kashinath hadn't felt so much happy.. ...when he got the job of a policeman. I have also taken many risks to reach at you. I am policeman. Therefore, I must have to take a risk. You tell me the truth regarding Irfan's murder. I will give you more happiness. No, no, sir! I am not greedy. The truth is that it's the job of the policemen.. ...to bring the truth to the forth. My cap is in my hand. I won't lie. I will tell you everything that I witnessed.. ...regarding Irfan's murder. Sir, don't mind. But for this case, I will charge 100 rupees for one second. Okay? Is it okay? Hey muscleman, is your watch alright? Hold this cap. Give me your watch. It's not stolen, is it? He is your man. How can it be stolen? Start! It was the scene of the night club. It was 11 o'clock. Everyone was dancing. Tell me something new. I have also seen it. What happened after the light was off? Yes! You had seen all this, right? In order to make money, I just.. After seeing the dead body, Irfan ran towards outside. Before we could reach at Irfan, he was dead. We have just got the dead body of Irfan. If I had seen his murderer, wouldn't.. ...I have shot him at the spot? It's 40 seconds. Only 4,000 rupees. Rizwan, give him 10,000. - 10, 000! He will do many things for us in the future too. Then, inspector Amar hasn't killed Irfan. - No! Then, who can kill my son? In this city, there is only one individual.. ...who can dare attack on Jibran. Tyson! The biggest drugs dealer in the city. His younger brother Jackson. Flora! Tyson's girl friend! And he is Marcos. Tyson's right hand. He makes all the killings take place.. ...in the city with the help of him only. He is a very dangerous man. Boot polish! Boot polish! Only in two rupees. Boot polish! Come on. Hey, the sole of your shoe is damaged, sir. - What? My sole has been damaged while searching for Marcos. That idiot goes to this hotel sometime and sometime.. ...he goes to that hotel to get escaped from police. Sir, he has come. Marcos darling, where will we go now? Darling, I have to get one delivery done. Marcos is the most loyal and special man of Tyson. Kashi! - Yes! If we catch Marcos with the stuff.. ...it will be easy for us to catch Tyson. Right, sir! What has happened? Wait for a while. I am just coming. - Come immediately, darling. Okay! Why is he going back? Someone must have called him. Who are you? - Your death! No! No! He took a short cut to come down. Stop, Vishal! There is a dead body outside. And I am searching for the murderer. Sorry! I can't help you in this matter. Can I ask you what you are doing here.. ...in this hotel when the accident took place? Why? Has a curfew been imposed over here? This is not the answer of my question. I have come here for some important work. Can I ask you what that important work is? This is my personal matter. Can I ask you what that personal matter is? Let me go, inspector! You are troubling me unnecessarily. The way you are walking on, you will find me.. ...on every turn of that turn, Vishal. It's my profession to trouble the criminals.. ...and get the truth revealed from them. You are messing up with me unnecessarily, inspector. What's the matter, Vishal? Who is messing up with you? Inspector Amar Saxena! According to him, I have killed someone just now, sir. Oh, no, no, inspector! You must have misunderstood something. - But sir, you.. Since last two hours, Vishal has been with me. Mr. Jindal, you don't know him completely. He has kept you in darkness. Oh, why will anyone keep a blind in darkness, dear? Anyway, your suspicion on Vishal is fully baseless. He is a very decent man. He can't tolerate the decency of.. ...the decent people, Mr. Jindal. Inspector Amar Saxena, nobody.. ...takes birth as a criminal. Your law and your police make him a criminal. Vishal, I am such a pawn of police whom you can't beat. And remember, the same dark room of the jail is waiting for you. Remember this. Suleman! - Yes, sir. In the midnight, all this stuff should reach at the boat. Okay! Police is checking in the night. Be cautious! It will be done, Mr. Jibran. Your last time has arrived, Jibran. I will kill you, rascal. I will kill you. Leave him! Leave him! You kill our men. - Get away, you scoundrel. You get aside, idiot. Idiot! What's all this going on? Why have you come here? I have come here to avenge Marcos's death, Jibran. Don't add fuel to the fire, Jackson. Otherwise I will have to forget my old friendship, Jackson. Jibran, you are talking about friendship before us. And behind us, you play the game of enmity. You dirty mind! Shut up, you dirty mind! The poison of suspicion has made your brain hollow. Brother, we have to kill all of them over here. Kill all of them. Stop! Tyson, I think you have come here to commit suicide. I am sparing you. But if you apply your tricks again, I won't say anything. Only my A. K. 47 will speak. Come on, Jackson! Brother, why have you spared these people? You shouldn't play the game of fire.. ...sitting on the explosives, Riiwan. It's good to calm down at this time. If Tyson dares to come in front of me next time.. ...I will kill him as well as his group. Come, sir! Hello, Mr. Jindal! Well done, Vishal! Well done! By making Tyson and Jibran bitter enemies.. ...you have found out a very good trick. They will keep fight with each other. And you can make them your target easily. But beware of the police, Vishal. Especially of inspector Amar Saxena. He is suspecting you. Vishal! Vishal! Vishal! You are after an innocent man unnecessarily. And you are so busy with him that you have forgotten me. You know what today's occasion is. What's the occasion? Don't really you know what today's occasion is? - No! Roma! What's the occasion today? Who are you waiting for, Roma? Everyone from your office has come. Roma, I think the ritual of the cutting.. ...of the cake should be over. Without having cake, how can the program proceed? What has happened, Roma? As soon as you stepped into 21 year.. ...you started feeling fear. Roma, I am eager to hear the applause. I think you are waiting for any of your special guests. No, sir! It's nothing like.. Anyway, Roma! Now, for the sake of God, cut the cake. Don't make us wait any more. All of us are hungry a lot. Yes. Am I right? What a smell it is! - What a smell it is! Roma, don't make the hungry people wait any more. All of us are very much hungry. Come on, Roma! How long will you make us wait? Don't waist time.. - Come on! Come on! Quick! I know you won't cut the cake without.. ...receiving the birthday gift. Come, dear! Come! Happy birthday, dear! - Thank you, aunt. Greetings, Mr. Jindal. - Greetings! Hello, sir! - Hello! Many happy returns of the day, Roma. Look, there are so many flowers and bouquets. Now, you will have to make my daughter happy.. ...with some special gift. What do you say, sister? - Of course, brother. Then, my daughter has chosen her life partner. And he is Amar Saxena. It's double happiness. Mr. Jailor, I couldn't understand something. - What is that? The press and police always mess up with each other. Then, how have they made an alliance this time? Many, many congratulations! - Thank you! Congratulations! Okay, make each other wear the rings! Shall we perform the rituals of engagement? Huh? From morning till evening, from evening till night. From morning till evening, from evening till night. From night till morning, from morning.. ...till the evening again. Love me! Just love me! Love me! Just love me! From the city till the village, from.. ...the sunshine till the shadow. From the city till the village, from.. ...the sunshine till the shadow. From the head till the feet, till all the feelings of the heart. Love me! Just love me! Love me! Just love me! Listen, O my Love, do anything.. ...but remember something. Listen, O my Love, do anything.. ...but remember something. Something before the marriage, something after it. Who will remember so many conditions in love? What to do before marriage, what to do after it? From near till far, from far till near. Till the thirst of these lips, from the earth till the sky. Love me! Just love me! Love me! Just love me! How complete love can occur just like that! How complete love can occur just like that! Whether you express it openly or refuse it openly. Embrace me and talk to me for a while. For more than that, you have to wait. From this side of the sea till that side of the sea. Till the limits of sight, from love till love. Love me! Just love me! Love me! Just love me! From morning till evening, from evening till night. From night till morning, from morning.. ...till the evening again. Love me! Just love me! Love me! Just love me! Who is speaking? Mr. Lee from Hong Kong. Hello, Mr. Lee! How are you? I am Flora speaking. Yes! One minute. Sir, Mr. Lee from Hong Kong. Hello, Mr. Lee! Yes! Yes! Yes! Mr. Jandela is also coming! That's good. Our meeting is confirmed. Same time same place. Okay! You have to be cautious, Kashi. We will never get a better chance.. ...than this to catch Tyson red handed. And no problem should be created, understand? From my side, no problem will be created. And I collected all the information from the airport. The Chinese and the black man haven't come in the flight. Are you sure? - Yes! Both of them must have changed.. ...their program in fear. 'After Marcos, Minto is the most loyal person of Tyson ' 'He supplies drugs near all the colleges.. ...and schools of the city ' He is Tyson's younger brother Mr. Jackson. Ok.. Hello, Mr. Lee! - Greetings! Mr. Jandela! - Hi! Where are the goods? The cash is here. No! At first I will see brown sugar. Then, you will see the money. Don't worry about the goods, Mr. Lee. The goods are excellent. No excellent! We want brown sugar. No excellent! Excellent mean pure, Mr. Jandela. The goods are pure. Wow! These are fully pure goods. As soon as you smell it, you start sweating. It's very hot stuff. A face on a face! Sir, why is he looking at me like this? Hey, the black colour is coming.. ..out of your face, stupid! Again, you have made me get trapped. What are you saying? This is Asian paint. And what is your beard saying, Chinese? Sir, tell him Indians and Chinese are brothers. Otherwise he will beat us a lot. He can do nothing! We will beat him. Who are you people? - Inspector Amar Saxena. Sub inspector Jandela alias Kashinath Sahu. Close down all the doors. Don't leave both of them alive. By coming here, these idiots have invited their own death. Hands up! Thank you! Shit! Police! Stop! Police! Thank you, sir! You have come like a God to save me. Yes, like God of death! Oh, he is dead. He is very lucky. He corpse is going on four wheels. And his last rituals have also been perormed altogether. - Oh good! Vishal Agnihotri! You mean to say by raiding my hideouts and by killing.. ...my associates unnecessarily, police is performing the duty. No, Amar has definitely created a disturbance in.. ...your warehouse, but he hasn't killed anyone. I myself don't understand who is performing.. ...our duties not even being a policeman. It's not Tyson but someone else is playing this game, sir. And he is intensifying the enmity of both of you. By the way, I very well know this fighter. Who is he? I will tell you. I will tell you. If I had revealed it before police.. I would have got an award. I don't need any award but your reward. But this time, I will take one thousand rupees per second. You know the STD rate becomes double in day time. I will take only five hundred rupees from you. I will collect the rest from Tyson. Shall I start now? Start! Minto ran. Our handsome inspector ran after him. I ran after him. While running, he got into a moving car. That stupid thought that he escaped police. But the driver of the car held him just like an eagle holds a rat. He took him towards death. The car fell down from a height of 50 ft. Our fighter jumped out of it. Minto died. But I have recognised that fighter. Tell me the name of that fighter. Vishal Agnihotri! Vishal Agnihotri! Yes, he is neither a policeman nor does he work for Tyson. You have got the shock, right? I had also got it. Police had found Vishal nearby the dead bodies.. ...both in Irfan and Marcos murder case. It's 50 seconds. Only 25,000! You will get it. Riiwan, go to the factory immediately.. ...and alert everyone. 'Vinda Thakur! The supervisor of Jibran's drugs factory ' 'Jibran has opened this textile mill only.. ...to cover up his illegal business ' 'Actually, he has a secret drug factory over here ' 'Every night, the thousands of kilos raw and material.. ...of drugs are brought here ' 'It is made more poisonous and then.. ...it is sent to the entire country ' 'If this drugs factory is destroyed.. ...Jibran will become weaker a lot ' Where are you going? Who are you? - Electrician! But the electricity supply is alright. It is alright, isn't it? - Yes! Now, it won't be the same. Run! Run! Hello! - Jibran! Both of us are misunderstanding something. For our loss, we are accusing each other. Whereas a third person has been taking advantage of.. ...our enmity and creating a difference between us. Who is he? - Vishal Agnihotri! But, why does he want to destroy us? I am worried about the same. Look Tyson, both of us should talk on this immediately. Come to my house tomorrow. I will come to your house tomorrow! No, Jibran! We will meet somewhere which should.. ...neither belong to you nor to me. We will meet at Boribondar at nine o'clock.. ...tomorrow morning. Okay! Speak up, dirty mind! Tyson, this is a very crucial moment. We will have to forget our internal enmity and get united. Hey, dirty mind! Is it your new trick, Jibran? I am hundred percent right. Believe me. Death is hovering around us. Vishal Agnihotri.. Cheating! - Fire! Kill the rascals! Kill everyone. Not a single person should be left alive. Kill the rascals! Kill everyone. Riiwan! - Dirty mind! Dirty mind, who are you? What are you taking revenge from me for? Dirty mind! Very good, Vishal! Very good! I expected the same from you. Okay, alright! Congratulations, sir! - Thank you! I think your mission is almost over. And it's not difficult for Vishal to kill commissioner. Yes, Desai! Today's occasion is very special for us. The aim that I had to clean the dirt.. ...of the city is getting fulfilled. Mr. Yadav, there is a lot of violence happening in the city. The entire city is under checking. Kranti, give me one more pack. Sir, you are drinking more today. Kranti, whenever I am happy, I drink liquor like water. Today, I am happy that someone is there. There is someone who is working for our department. He is cleaning the dirt.. And you know this.. What you say social reformer.. He doesn't get himself entangled with autopsy.. ...arrest, presenting in the court and the listening of the court. He shoots directly. The matter is over! The matter is over! Kranti! - Sir! Kranti, I think our department should appoint.. ...four to five more social reformers.. ...instead of increasing the number of police stations. Yes! All the cases will be over on the spot. Sir! Sir, you have said a wonderul thing. Come, Vishal, come! Today, I want to embrace you. By killing the commissioner, you have done.. ...a great favour to the society. You have eliminated the evil from the society, Vishal. The evil can be eliminated with.. ...the help of truth, Mr. Jindal. And the truth is not that which you had told me. That's why I have left the commissioner alive. What?! Even after knowing everything.. ...you have left him alive! Mr. Jindal, I believe in what I see and what I hear. I have come to know about commissioner. He is an officer who has surrendered himself.. ...to the system. He is very decent and honest. He doesn't have friendship but enmity.. ...with the criminals like Tyson and Jibran. But even then, you presented him wrongly before me. Why did you do like this, Mr. Jindal? Why did you do like this? Tell me. Commissioner is a very big pretender, Vishal. By believing in his pretence, you are committing a very big mistake. This also may happen that you may be pretending before me. Maybe I am committing a very big mistake.. ...by believing you blindly. Vishal! Vishal! A blind man can't defend him so actively, Mr. Jindal. Then, you are not blind. You can see everything. Yes, very well. And you were making me play like a puppet! Yes! You have come to a perfect conclusion, Vishal. By believing in me blindly, you have really done.. ...a wrong thing. But by choosing you, I haven't committed any mistake. Because I needed a weapon to.. ...kill my enemies Tyson and Jibran. - What? - When Roma told me about you.. ...I decided to make you my pawn at the very moment. The problem is that, Vishal, I want to become.. ...the richest and most powerful person in the world. Cheater! Your cheating story will be ended by me. Bind him! If you give your command, big brother, I will kill him. His time is of course over, Jibran. But he still has some debts left with me. He has served me a lot. That's why I will have to answer.. ...the questions arising in his mind. Otherwise he will die with dissatisfaction. Vishal, I have gone through many hardships.. ...to reach at this position. I have been through so many dangers. I had always had the zeal to earn enormous money. If you want to become rich, stop.. ...all your illegal business at first. Be self dependant and do hard work. How long will you remain in your friend's house.. ...without paying anything? Why don't you work in my father's printing press? Pooja! I want all the luxuries of the world. I want money, a lot of money. If you want to earn a lot of money quickly, then you.. ...have to stop the smuggling of watches and clothes. You have to move with the time. And the demand of the time is hashish.. ...brown sugar, cocaine and opium. That's why my dirty mind has planned a scheme. After doing this work, you can become millionaire over night. But there is a lot of danger in it. I am ready to face any danger. Okay! The scheme is that on the state border.. ...inspector Karan is on duty nowadays. I have talked with our client from Dubai. They will get the goods down at Korai port. You will have to cross the state border with the goods. Okay! Karan, the smugglers have started.. ...their new business at the state border. They are doing drugs business. We should be cautious. Hey, Kulkarni! I have arranged such security at.. ...the check post that not even an ant can pass through. Brother, the problem is that he doesn't come back.. ...home at any fixed time. I have told him to come back home soon.. By the way, what is Jindal doing nowadays? He is struggling like ever. He doesn't want to work in my father's printing press. I am tired of persuading him. Brother, you are his friend. Why don't you persuade him? Okay! Day after tomorrow, my wife and my son.. ...are coming back from granny's house. On that day, we will have our meal together. I will persuade him at that time. Thanks! Let's go! Karan Saxena sir is coming. Lift the barrier. Hey, what's there in your taxi? Is everything alright? Sir, we are searching each and every vehicle. Good! Okay! Don't worry, sir! Get the barrier down. When will the partition be done, Tyson? Tomorrow, I'll make the deal finalised.. ...with the party at the day time. Tomorrow, at night the partition.. ...will be done over here, dirty mind. Don't worry, my dear! The share will be equal. The share won't be equal. I have taken the risk. I have put my life into risk. I had driven the car through the border. That's why I will get half of it. Both of you divide the rest between you. The share will be 50-50 now. Half is yours and half is mine. And he will get imprisoned as his share. Hello! Jindal! I didn't know I had given shelter.. ...to a criminal but not my friend. If you hadn't been my friend, I wouldn't have arrested you.. ...for such a serious crime like this. Rather I would have killed you. Hello, Mr. Kulkarni! I am Pooja speaking. Inspector Karan Saxena has been murdered just now. You come immediately.. No! No! A man prospers with the help of a woman. And he also gets destroyed by a woman. No, I won't give you the opportunity to destroy me. Pooja! - Hey! My eyes! My eyes! I can't see anything. Pooja! Four people were there. I don't know who they were. Inspector Saxena fought with them bravely. But.. But my wife tried to call police. They killed her by strangling. I don't know what those scoundrels put into my eyes.. ...I was unable to see after that. I have become blind. I have become blind. I.. Have become blind, inspector. Come, Amar dear! Come! Come! Have you faced the consequence.. ...of messing up with us, Jindal? Blind man, keep quiet regarding our matter. Otherwise I will turn you into a dead man. 'In this way, acting like a blind man.. ...I made a unique plan to cheat the society ' 'I used to feel danger from Kamdev Kulkarni from.. ...the beginning, that's why his death was necessary ' 'And then, the main aim of my life.. ...was the destruction of Tyson and Jibran ' 'So that I could become the emperor of crime ' 'And to fulfill the same, I made you my pawn.' Forgive me, big brother. Please be kind. Now onwards, if I commit any mistake.. ...beat me with your shoes. Jibran, by reaching at time, you have made.. ...your life longer. I have forgiven you. What do you think, Vishal? Have you learnt anything from my story? The moral of the story is that Jindal.. ...is very merciless and unkind. I uproot everything that comes in the way of my success. Hey, I haven't spared my wife. How can I spare you? Bomb! I will blow you up into pieces. Good bye, Vishal! Roma! Roma! Vishal, you! - Roma! What has happened? - Roma.. You are bleeding. Come! I will apply medicines to you. Come on! Vishal, how have you got such serious injuries on your head? Roma, listen to me. Roma! Keep quiet! - Roma.. Look, how much it is bleeding! Oh, Vishal, keep quiet. Let it be alright! Then, you talk. Okay! Amar! Sorry, I am on duty. That's why I didn't knock the door. This is the file of all your crime. Now, you can't deny that all the killings took place.. ...in this city, those were done by you. You are a professional criminal. It's your profession to kill people. Decently you.. Amar, whatever you are thinking, it's not true. If you listen to the truth, you will get a shock. The truth has been revealed. All the secrets have been disclosed. Please, listen to Vishal, Amar. Now, don't act any more, Roma. After meeting him once in the jail.. ...you developed a very good relationship with him. You tried hard to get him out of jail. And I don't know how many times you might have given.. ...your lover shelter in your house. You don't have any right to humiliate me like this. Yes, only your lover has all the rights. Amar, you are humiliating me. Shut up! Inspector Amar Saxena, if you want to show your.. ...manly power so much, lay your hands on a man. Those who hide behind the drape of women are not man. Vishal, stop it! Sir, Mr. Jibran has come to meet you. Big brother, greetings! I had told you not to come here. Why have you come here? I was compelled to come here, brother. Kashi! - Yes! How come this policeman over here! Who is he? He is Kashinath Sahu, brother. This is my perfect pawn in police. He has brought very useful information, big brother. Big brother! He is your big brother! Oh, then, the door to the head office opens from here! Mr. Jindal, by the way Jibran must have told you.. ...about my reporting and charging. Today, I will take 5,000 rupees per second. Because it's a special bulletin. Hey, make it fast. Brother doesn't have time. Okay! Start! You know Vishal.. Vishal Agnihotri! Inspector Amar has put him behind the bars. Now, he has no chance to get escaped. He is very strong but by tomorrow morning.. ...he will confess everything. It's nine seconds. Means 45,000 rupees. Please, let me have it. It means he is still alive! - Yes! And he will confess by tomorrow morning. Then, we will be proved as criminals before the law. Yes, big brother! This is not the time to have party. Find out some way out, otherwise.. ...as soon as it's morning.. Otherwise as soon as it's morning.. It's eight hours to the morning. Tonight, we will get a new pawn. By morning, the game will receive a setback. He can see. Oh! In my career of 12 years.. ...I had never got such a shock. What is this? Your black goggles have deceived.. ...the entire department. Praise to you, Mr. Jindal. How nice it is! We should have the blessings of a man like this. Please, bless me! Why are you looking at me like this, sir? I am observing you don't seem.. ...to be as much evil as you are. I haven't inherited all the qualities of my father. Sir, my life is in your controls. You are rich people. You can recover anything. But I fear I won't belong to any of the sides. Could you understand this? Please, think about me. You just remain in the police department.. ...and give us all the information. It's good for you. I have understood it. I have understood it. I will behave like a younger brother. You are the eldest. I am the youngest. And Jibran is in the middle. Have you understood what I meant, Brother Jibran? Don't do nonsense. Try to understand what brother is saying. I have understood it. I have understood it perfectly. Commissioner, we are happy that today you have come.. ...to the anniversary of our newspaper. Hi! - Hello! Hello, inspector Amar! - What's the matter, Amar? Whom have you messed up with? How have you got these injuries? Sir, I have arrested Vishal. You have arrested Vishal! I have got the evident which proves he is a murderer. What are you saying? He will confess his crime very soon. Oh, who will you have to make confess.. ...over here, inspector Amar? I have put that murderer behind the bars, Mr. Jindal. By tomorrow morning, I will answer everyone. Why is he doing all this? And, who is he doing all this for? I am sure. Hello, Roma! - Hi! Hi! Where were you, Roma? You are so late. The party has begun much earlier. Mr. Jindal has been waiting for you since so long. He has already asked about you for 10 to 15 times. What a lovely dress, Roma! You look very beautiful, Roma. What is your intention? Get rid of joking. Where is Mr. Jindal? Oh, he was over here just now. He is over there. Oh! Mr. Jindal! - Roma! Hello, Roma! Late arrival! I have been waiting for you since so long. I am sorry, sir. Your absence had put me into difficulty. If all the editors are not present in the party of.. ...your newspaper, it seems something is incomplete. This party is for you only. You should be around me. Come! I want to introduce you with some people. Commissioner! - Yes! I would like you to meet Ms. Roma Singh. I know her. I have already met her. Alright. She is our editor. But the truth is that within a few days he has made.. ...a very strong relationship with our newspaper. O I see! Then, you give her credit for your success. If you wish, I will print this news in my newspaper. Hey, man! Where are you going? Stop! You won't get milk or anything like this in this party. And you don't even drink. Hold an empty glass. Maybe you will get intoxicated with.. ...the empty glass in this party surrounding. Oh, he has drunk the entire bottle! Excuse me, commissioner! I have to meet some other people. Come on, Roma! Dear, to do away with the hurt in the heart.. ...don't take the support of alcohol, but of words. You have got the injuries in your head. But you are feeling pain in your heart. What do you say? I wish it had happened.. ...I wish man had two hearts. I wish it had happened.. ...I wish man had two hearts. If one of them were broken in love. If one of them were broken in love, life wouldn't be difficult. Life wouldn't be difficult. I wish it had happened.. I wish man had two hearts. People tell the truth.. People tell the truth that after being drunk.. ...the difficulties are forgotten. Which ever the pain of the heart is.. ...it turns into medicine. When the heart is burning.. When the heart is burning, what's.. ...the problem in drinking? What's the problem in drinking? I wish a man had two hearts. If one of them were broken in love. If one of them were broken in love, life wouldn't be difficult. Life wouldn't be difficult. I can't forget this shock. I will always remember this. Someone has given me such a pain.. ...that will make me suffer for years. The hurts in the heart can't be recovered.. The hurts in the heart can't be recovered.. ...with a small period of time. With a small period of time. I wish it had happened.. Man had two hearts. If one of them were broken in love. If one of them were broken in love. Life wouldn't be difficult. Life wouldn't be difficult. I wish it had happened.. ...man had two hearts. Roma, I have stopped you here to talk to you.. ...about some important matter. What's that matter, sir? It's strange. I can't see you but I can feel you completely. Your sadness, your smile.. ...your laugh and your worries.. ...I can feel everything. You can see. Even then, can't you feel my condition? What are you saying, sir? I don't understand anything. Let me explain it! I want to marry you, Roma. Sir! - Yes! I had decided it much earlier. Many times, I was about to tell this. But perhaps, this is the right time to tell you, Roma. How could you imagine of such a relationship with me? Sir, I respect you. And you also know that I love Amar. And then.. I also love you, Roma. And I love you one thousand times more than Amar. Roma, I have told you about this with love. I wanted you to agree to this with a smile. If you.. Sir, what has happened to you? I have been intoxicated. I have been intoxicated. This exquisite face has made me mad. Can you see my face.. I want to kiss your lips. You can see me. Roma, since last two years, this blind man has enjoyed.. ...your beauty with the eye he has behind his black goggles. Now, I can't tolerate it any more. Don't touch me. Oh, no, no, no! Works like this can't be done.. ...with these soft hands. These hands are to be kissed. These hands are to be kissed. No, no! I can never be yours. Never! Listen! I haven't proposed you for marriage. I have given my judgement. My judgement! Now, you should only say 'yes'. Understand! Yes! Mr. Jindal, about the heading, yesterday.. He can see, Mr. Siddiqui. Mr. Jindal, what are you doing? Such misbehavior with Roma! Save me, Mr. Siddiqui. Save me! Let get off Roma, Mr. Jindal! Otherwise I will disclose you in the newspaper tomorrow. I will disclose you. Okay, I am leaving her. But the headlines of tomorrow's paper will be.. ...murder of the editor of the Samadhan Mr. Siddiqui. You must be thinking that I have called.. ...you for interrogation. Then, I will also make you confess your crime, right? Open his handcuffs. Open! I am freeing you on my own risk. Brother Vishal, I am very happy that you are free. Congratulations a lot. Why? You are very much surprised of getting free, right? You know why I am setting you free. Because after getting retirement, I have done.. ...at least one good thing being in the department. What are you doing? What are you doing, sir? You know he is a criminal. He has deceived the law. And even then, you are setting him free. Yes, I am leaving him. Because I know what I am doing. He will definitely get punishment in the court. But after he gets punishment, this series.. ...of crimes won't stop, Amar. Enough, sir, enough! Today, I have come to know about you. Whole your life, you misused your position. - Amar! Yes, I am right. You have misused your position and designation. You have always discouraged the people.. ...who wanted catch the criminals. You have given shelter to criminals like him. Amar, you are misunderstanding me. I understand you correctly. I understand you perfectly. My father sacrificed his life while performing his duty. And you have closed the file of his murder. Because you didn't want his murderers to be arrested. You have been sold. You have been sold, sir. Inspector Amar Saxena, whatever you are thinking.. ...it's not the truth. There is only one criminal who has bewildered all of us. And the name of that scoundrel is Jindal. Jindal! What are you saying? Yes, sir. Jindal! I was doing all this for Jindal. After getting me out of the jail, he instigated me.. ...to kill the criminals. He made of a victim of his conspiracy. And he kept me in the darkness saying.. ...that I was destroying crime from the society. He was destroying his enemies through me. Because he wants to become the crownless emperor.. ...of the crime world. This is not enough. He also wanted to kill you through you. Sir, Jindal pretended of being blind only to deceive police. Amar, Jindal has the answer of.. ...the significant question of our life. Yes, Amar! The murderer of your father whom you are.. ...searching for is none other than Jindal himself. Jindal! Hello! Have you heard the ring of death, commissioner? Jindal! - Yes! You have recognized my voice. You have come with all preparations. But what's the use of it? Your target has escaped. Where can he go? We policemen find out the criminals from anywhere. Kamdev, you can just boast like this. You shouldn't become the commissioner but a constable. You are talking a lot as you are away, right? By the way, I am ready with a noose of your fitting. You can't do anything, Kamdev. I am going to do. If I decide something once, I do it. Whatever I want, I get it. It's my habit to apply tricks. If you have one of my pawns, what's the problem? I have the queen. Queen. Commissioner! - Roma! Roma, what are you doing there? Jindal has brought me here forcibly. He is a very dangerous man. He has also killed Mr. Siddiqui. He will also kill you, Amar. You don't put your life into stake for me. Don't worry, Roma! Now, Jindal can't get escaped from me. His end is must. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Karan Saxena's son is talking like him only. If you were in front of me, I would explain you.. ...with my hands and feet. Dear, instead of applying your hands.. ...and feet, apply your brain. Do as Roma is saying. Jindal, I will definitely reply your terror. While replying, don't forget to bring my father-in-law with you. He will only give the bride away. Sir, tell me where he is. I will just go and teach him a lesson. Yes, he has called only to tell his address. Amar, along with the destruction of Jindal.. ...we also have to think about Roma's life. You do something. One minute, sir! - What has happened? Pay attention! Jindal ran away from over night. As soon as we arrived here, he called us. It's clear that he gets all the information.. ...about our planning. Amar is right. Jindal had already known.. ...that police was coming to arrest him. - It means there is a betrayer in our department. And that betrayer in between us at this time. But I.. I will recognize him. Tell me, you betrayer. Hadn't you informed Jindal? Tell me. You are misunderstanding me. I haven't done anything. You haven't done anything? - No! Take him away! Take him away! Come! Please believe me, sir! Living in the country, being a policeman.. ...and being my junior, you betray.. Amar, are you committing any mistake? Because Kranti can't do anything like this. Sir, I have just played a blind. If the trick is perfect, we will get.. ...the first step to reach at Jindal. What?! 10,000 per second! What important news you have, tell me. The policemen are running in wrong direction. They have caught Kranti Kumar instead of catching me. Now, it's impossible for them to reach at Mr. Jindal. 10 seconds! One lakh rupees! One lakh rupees! One lakh rupees! Kranti! - Ghost! If Kranti has committed suicide in the lock up.. ...why is her soul moving around here? Sir! Now, your soul will move around. Your game is over, Kashinath. Your game is over. Hello, Mr. Douglas! He has his power all around Europe. Mr. Jindal, now everyone in the international market.. ...wants to join hands with you. Why won't they want this? He is the crime emperor of India. Am I right, big brother? Right! Oh, sure! That's why I am feeling happy.. ...that he has made me his business partner. Mr. Douglas, I have selected perfect people.. ...from this country to supply goods. Nobody has his name in the police record. Everyone is while coloured. Tomorrow's meeting will leave a mark in the history.. ...of this country. Because after tomorrow, blood won't run.. ...in the vessels of the people of this country.. ...but the poison that we will sell will run. No! No! No! No. - This injection will create a current in her body.. ...that she will be forced to break all the barriers of dignity. Like a new bride, she will embrace me. No, Mr. Jindal. No. No. No, Mr. Jindal. No. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am not in my senses. I am not in my senses. I am also in my youth. It isn't my fault.

Who is the king and who is a pawn? I don't know what my name is. I don't know what my name is. I don't know what your name is. What is in the name? What is in the name, just arrange for liquor. Splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. Hey you, remember one thing.. ...don't know what will happen to you. Hey you, remember one thing.. ...don't know what will happen to you. How many hearts broke. How many hearts broke. All the lovers drowned. All the lovers.. All the lovers separated, who were like a bond. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am not in my senses. I am also in my youth. It isn't my fault. All the time I am intoxicated. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. I am splendid. Friends, as it was decided, all of you will do drugs business.. ...in your respected regions. And all of you will see, within one year.. ...I will make all of you billionaires. For our success, three things are very important. Instead of having cheating in between us, we will get united. Where are you going? I am working for Mr. Jibran. There is very.. ...important information for Mr. Jindal. I have come to give it. Check him. And we should have the zealousness to make our.. ...drugs reach every city, every village and even every house. Wait! Where are the keys of your car? And third, whoever comes in the way of our success.. ...we will have to make him keep quiet. If not with money, it's with bullet. Are all of you ready? - Yes, all of us are ready. Why are you putting my life in stake? Go! Go! Okay, I am going. This meeting is our first and last meeting. Tomorrow, I am going abroad with my would-be-bride. And day after tomorrow, both of us will get married. Congratulations! In advance! Why have you come here? To congratulate big brother. How dare you come here without permission! - I..

This injured man and queen are with me. That's why don't try to do any smartness. Throw the gun! Throw the gun! Don't try to follow me. Otherwise you will repent a lot. I swear on my father, Jindal, today or tomorrow.. ...I will definitely shoot you. You are under my control, but still you haven't got rid.. ...of your arrogance, inspector! Do as I say. Kneel down! - No, Amar! Kneel down! - No, Amar! Now, rub your nose on the floor. Don't humiliate yourself, Amar. Run your nose on the floor. Don't humiliate yourself. Very good, inspector! - No!
