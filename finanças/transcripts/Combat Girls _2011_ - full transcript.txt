Democracy is the best thing we ever had on German soil. We're all equal. There is no up, no down. In a democracy, everyone can have a say. You, me ... ...alcoholics, junkies, child molesters, niggers. People who are too stupid to get through high school. People who don't give a shit if this land goes to hell. But I do give a shit.

In the same direction as Markus? - I'm actually not so political. I don't understand it at all. I'm still Marxist. Can I have another piece of pie? - No, we'll save that for Markus.

Keep on good standing. See where that gets you. The cops are coming. Man, piss off! Beat it! What's your name? Name. Name! Rasul. And you live alone? Asylum Seekers Centre? Stop, stop. - Here? Thank you. Bye! Go, go. Please go! Shit! Bon-bon. Look, Afghanistan. You wanted to speak to me? Indeed. Come here. What is it? Are you nervous? - No. Naturally! Perhaps you'd like a cigarette? - No. Nicotine soothes the nerves, you know. - I don't smoke. I swear! Everyone in my class smokes but I find it yukky. What is that? Those aren't mine. They'r from your pants pocket. - Why do you go into my pockets? I'm sorry. Do you know why you shouldn't smoke? Because your first wife died of lung cancer.

Shut your trap. - Man, leave her be! Don't tease. What's up, dude? We struggle until every stooge in this miserable administration is hung from a good old German oak tree. And all the Niggers and foreign scum will shit their pants. So that you may also learn something tonight, switch off the light and the video. The convoluted jargon of international criminals ... stems not unduly from Hebrew and Yiddish. These physiognomies refute strikingly, the liberal theory ... of equality of the human face. Howerver they alter their appearance ... when they come out of the Polish nesting site into the wide world beyond. It would have otherwise been incomprehensible given the love of animals of the German people that the Jews could up to the present perpetrate gruesome atrocities on innocent, defenseless animals with impunity. These images clearly demonstrate the cruelty of the slaughter method. They reveal at the same time the character of a breed that hides its barbarity under the pious cloak of religion. They have to slaughter them. In general Jews kosher butchers tie the animals down, so their death throes don't reveal their agony. Sometimes they slaughter the animals without tying them. Shit! Cut the cop act. (Traitor) Backstabber! I'll kill you! You junkie piece of shit! I'll waste you! Backstabber! (Throw out the pusher. Traitor.) Piss off! I swear, I'll kill you, man. Boot him out! Come. I don't wanna leave. (HITLER) We need to create a new man. When we succeed in giving the German people new ideas ... Shitty drugs! Forget thst shit! Those are just words. Let me see. Nothing but words. Deeds! I want to see action! I'm ready for the war. There are only two ways to get by ... Unemployment ... Trash TV. Homeless Germans, asylum seekers, Wog scum. I swear the bomb will burst soon. And I will make sure that this time no crap survives. It's authentic. "Walther P-38". 1938 - Wehrmacht issued. Clean as your bank account. How much? - 600. Now? Do I look like a Jew? Think you'll get credit from me? - It's too much. It's too much. - 600, no debate. Give him 200, he's scamming you. - Quiet. - Can't you control her? Don't give him all of it! - Man, shut your mouth, now! Must you always interfere when men do business? Know what they did before with the likes of you? Right in the gas chamber! Is the long hair the only thing that sets you apart from a boy? You never know when to stop! Evrything alright? - Yeah, now piss off! If you were my age, you wouldn't have been thrown out. I'm not a hanger-on. Next time I'll chuck you down. Still going to tag along? - Yeah! Don't wanna be treated like a child? - No! Thanks Grete. What's your real name? - Melanie. Okay, done. Go wash up. Can you me one? The 88. (88=HH = Heil Hitler) Does it really hurt? A little. Don't start crying again. (BURNING STAGE) This is sweet! Give me that. What kind of noiseis that ? What stuff are you listening to? That's terrible! Another smoke before dinner? - No, leave me alone. What is it? - Nothing! What, "nothing"? Did you bang yourself or ... Oh really, girl! - Mom! You're too young for that! - Not at all too young. It's a political statement, and you can never be too young! Political statement? - Yeah, absolutely! - It's an 88? 89 I can understand, but 88 I can't. - Well, you're kinda dumb. You're doped up, like everyone else. That's the cause of our country's decay. Go away. You've lost your mind... - Go away. Come to eat, now and cut the malarky! "The Countess arrives at dinner." Is that necessary? Put away the computer while we eat! You must turn off the computer at dinner! - Man, it's fine! Not hungry? - No. It gets worse. Are you crazy? Pay for it out of your allowance. You got that?! From 15 euros a month? - Then we'll sell your laptop. No way. It's from my father. - Oh, excuse me. Asshole. "This" is for "asshole". - Are you nuts? Get out! What's wrong, man? Have you no pride, so you hang around with such people? What do you want here? - Looking for you. All of a sudden you were gone. What do you want here? Come here, you cunt! Fix him good! Here! This is for you, you cunt! - Shitty son of a whore! - Old wanker! What happened to you? It's good. What is it? He's finally dead. Who? Who indeed! Mama, that's not true? Leave me alone. Don't touch me. Don't touch me! What is it? What's wrong? Why don't you return my love, hm? What's wrong with you? Fuck yourself! Piss off! What's wrong with you? What is it? Go fuck yourself,.. cunt! ...the scene of so many important events in German history. On the eve of the great decision to speak the people, they rushed from the farthest villages, young and old and awaited anxiously the man on whom their hopes hung. A roar of cheers accompanied the Fuehrer as he went to "Technology House" that huge hall from which his final radio message was broadcast to the entire assembled country. This is my grandfather. He was a soldier. This is the father of my mother. Your father? - No, father of mother. I want to make tattoo. I want to make here tatto of this picture. tattoo of this picture.

You can sleep here. What stay here?! - Yeah. No! - How ungrateful. At least it's dry. You have postcard, you call we go to boat. (Take cover position!) (And up!) My grandfather was always there for me. (Get a move on!) When my parents were at work. Then we sat together in the living room and did crossword puzzles. Or we just said nothing. See those bums? Bunch of idiots. Keep you ass down... Low! I don't wanna be like my mother. She's a ghost. She has no life. If I have children, I'll raise them very differently. You can't have children anymore in this world. I got one. Yes, of course. I always wanted something that beloned only to me. But six months later, they took it away from me. Why? I ran away from home. What about your parents? I left them a message. NATIONAL RESISTANCE - SIEG HEIL Maybe this? This goes the other way round. Oh! Thanks. This is the best jacket. What is this?

What are you doing? - Shut up. I'm leaving. Oh, look at you! - I'm clearing out. What?! Stay here. You're staying! If you leave this house now, you'll never come back. And you're no longer my daughter. Do you understand me? No more. You can't leave me alone now. Please don't leave me alone. You don't know what I've lived through here. What your beloved grandfather did to me! He treated me like dirt... filth. When he discovered I was pregnant ... he yanked me by my hair all the way down the stairs. He kicked me in the belly with his boots, till I blacked out. But once you arrived, everything was OK. His little princess. I'm outta here! - Stay! You can't go! Stand together, stand together. Our banner is hoisted Stand together, stand together, until victory is ours! Against the Jews and blacks and parliamentarism there is only one remedy: National Socialism! We'll take care of them in a gas chamber in Berlin Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Come. What's going on? - Get in. Who's this? Open the door, whore!... Shit! I have someone here who wants to go to Sweden. Yes, to Sweden... Hello? Yes, one. And when? Do you still have that money? Yeah. - Give it here. I promise you'll get it all back. OK? Here. - We go to boat? - Yes. I thought"we" were running off. - Svenja, you're 15. Don't you get it? How long do you think, before the cops are at the door? Come along for few days and then, I'll put you on a train home. Hello. Where are you? I'm sorry with your brother. Is he dead? No... Why? Because of me. I kill him? No. If you kill my brother, I kill you. We go to hospital. Problem with paper. Police come. Arrest him, and send him back.. He's now in Pakistan. What is it? - You aslee, or what? No, I'm coming. Here, want one? - Thanks. Did you buy it with my money too? Is he coming? Who has the money? You're like me. I always thought: "This must change. That should happen and then... And then I can really live." That way life slips through your fingers. I'm cold. - Okay, I won't be long. Can you come to school, Monday? - Why? I have a presentation. About your times. About Hitler, concentration camps ... and how bad it all was. There's so much said about this time. You should think carefully about who you believe. They're more powerful than ever. And they're still spreading their lies and their poison. Who? The Jews. Democracy is the best thing we ever had on German soil. We're all equal. There is no up, no down. Everything will change. And everyone can have a say.
