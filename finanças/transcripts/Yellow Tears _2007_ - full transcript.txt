I'm not talented Have you seen Maestro Samejima? Not at all I owe him too much money to visit I was happiest when we were his assistants After all. We picked up all our bad habits there Drinking, smoking... It was the first time for both us Eisuke! Muraoka san! Did you find him? The Ship is closed He wouldn't run off with the liquor money I bet he got picked up for questioning by the cops In the old days, we'd be headed for Shinjuku at this hour "After it's exploded," "a volcano is just a mountain..." Are you OK? "Look up at the sky" "and see all the stars" "They're just up there, beautiful," "they're just up there, twinkling" 'Dear shooting star.

Mukai Ryuzo What's the big deal? Haven't you figured it out? The 4 of us are all artists Wrong! We're a bunch of country bumpkins Reality is harsh! But just you wait Things will change tomorrow That's right, tonight is a truly historic evening Tonight will be celebrated by future generations as the moment when great artists were hatched from this shabby little salon All right! Once again, celebrating this special night Cheers! Cheers! All right, singer Sing another song Go, Shoichi! Here goes! "Climb one mountain, up, over and away we go" "Climb the next mountain. Up, over and away we go..." Shut up! Shhh Be quiet! Quiet! Up, over and away... What brings you here? I was hoping I could work on that Maestro Kajikawa script. You mentioned the other day Listen. A great opportunity like that gets snapped right up Some tea Yes And no advances We're not well off enough to loan money to people who don't draw manga Thing is, I just got... A roommate A roommate? - A girl? - No. No If it's pocket money you need, I have a lead I'll do it Samejima Maestro Hey, where have you been, Grand Maestro?

Let me hear a new one Looking forward Sure Bye When you think about it, don't you think we'd make money faster with some part time job? No way It's decadent for an artist to work at anything other than art I agree This experience of poverty is just the food you need to sing with real soul Beautiful A beautiful painting It's yours When it's finished, I'll give it to you Please accept it Pachinko Hall Thank you Go for it again, today You'll hit the jackpot Hey, lady! Hey, lady! Stop banging the machine The balls are stopped here Fix it What did you buy? It's all from Pachinko Isn't tomorrow your day off? That's right, why? Want to go out on a date? I'd love to Where are you taking me? I packed us lunch I just sort of woke up early, this morning I'm Eisuke san's friend No, really, just a friend Eisuke san's under a terrible deadline Everyday, people from the magazines visit where he's staying, and fight each other over Eisuke san's manga He's so popular I'm so glad it worked No, it is not It's not right You're right She looked really sick No doubt She was way too sick to operate on I hate hospitals I never even visited my own Mom, when she was hospitalized with a stroke If I hadn't faked being a doctor, I would've visited her myself That's right I feel ridiculous Why are we having a picnic here? Where are we? Itabashi Please do something The printer can't wait anymore I never imagined Maestro Samejima would really collapse A rice ball? What if we miss the printer's deadline? You're in the home stretch Maestro Eisuke, please! You're almost done. Please Now's your chance! Go for it, Zero! Go for it! Go for it! Now's your chance, Zero! Go for it, Zero! I wonder how Mikako is She's so cute Her pale skin. Her long hair, she's just perfect Now's not the time We're on the verge of starving Cut the crap. This is hardly the time to drool over a girl Pork cutlet bowl Tempura bowl Chicken-egg bowl Eel-egg bowl Eel bowl Egg bowl Egg bowl sounds sort of pathetic Really. That's all you got? My fountain pen... I'm sorry That's the best I could do Hey My painting? You thought I failed Here you go! 10,000 yen notes! I'll take 5.000 yen as my commission So. You painted that art? Very impressive I found a really great art gallery I figured I could get at least 30.000 yen for it. But they paid 40,000 yen for it Fantastic We can eat our fill I can get my fountain pen back My guitar, the clothes. The fan... Amazing I sold a painting Amazing Amazing I never knew the guy on 10.000 yen notes had a beard He's got a good face It's really impressive I hear Van Gogh didn't sell a single painting before he died In a sense. You've surpassed Van Gogh Well, Van Gogh and I have slightly different styles Well, I'm off Sir, thank you so much I'll be right back Yamagishi san! Can you please tell me which gallery bought Kei's painting? Why do you need to know? Hey, kids What day is today? Yes. Today is July 21st Summer vacation begins today Today! Two coffees, please Tasty Your pasta's delicious Thanks Sakaguchi's the best Says, 'All Japanese must be decadent" So cool Did you read it. Chie? "On Decadence" The one about 10 idiots? Excellent! Chie, you're really funny You think? Your potato sandwich is perfect, too! You guys managed to waste close to 20,000 yen, in a week? We didn't just spend it on food and drink We got the fan, our pants and the guitar, back from the pawn shop Things just added up... We had to pay interest And our tab at The Ship A desperate struggle lasting 17 days My wages for working without sleep or rest Behold! One. Two... Three Four. Five Amazing, five 10.000 yen notes Plus 4.000 yen I've never seen so many 10,000 yen notes together If you add my wages to Kei's 16.000 yen, we've managed to get a hold of some real money I propose that as of tomorrow, we use this to start life over again No objections? No objections, but... It's a shame to be serious in the face of all this cash I say we head out to Shinjuku and paint the town... I hate to say this. But you have no idea what it means to make a living Or about freedom Freedom? In any case, let's go to the bath I haven't had one in a week Muraoka. Just because you made a little money. Don't get carried away I agree I may not know about making a living but I certainly know about freedom All right. Then tell me What? What is freedom? Freedom is doing what you please, as you please Eisuke does manga, Ryuzo does novels. Shoichi does pop songs I do oil painting That's what I think freedom is I agree Therefore. We can't have steady jobs I refuse to sell my body for money That's what I just did That's not true You're a manga creator so you went and drew manga You made an independent decision and choice No! You just don't get it Um... Ultimately, what was that... Starting life over? That's right Hey, Yuji Evening Going to the bath? You guys. Too? Let's go together Sure Don't misunderstand me I take my freedom seriously. Too But I want to feel genuine about the manga I create Right But the stuff I really want to create. Doesn't sell And if I race around making money, there's no time left for my own work So the problem is simple Money solves everything, as long as you start out with it That's it If you have some real money to eat with, there's no problem We can make freedom ours This is our chance A friend? Sort of Even if it only lasts this summer... What we all need now. Is to experience what it's like to commit ourselves to our respective creative pursuits, without worrying about money That's right I've got to totally dedicate myself to my music, and think of nothing else, but my music Shut up. You literary mouse We've got 70,000 yen But it won't last all summer for the 4 of us The rest of this month, then August and September It won't last 8 weeks No way. No way Not even if we survive on 2 meals a day But you can! Sure, you can! If you're serious. And your wanting that freedom is straight from your hearts You can do it Sure you can Hearing what you all said, moved my heart Yuji If we cook, we might manage Cook? You've been eating out 3 meals a day? Us, cook... We have to We can't live like this! Get it together I will I'll get it together I swear I will... So here's your allowance until September. 5.000 yen each Here you go 29.500 yen left I can keep it for you. But can you really live on that to September? We've paid 3 months rent in advance, including the electric and water bills We can pay off our coffee tab here Please Speaking of which, here's 400 yen for today's meal 400 yen Thank you If you're going to cook, I assume you've bought rice and miso, at least You haven't? What are you going to eat? 1,050 yen for 10 kilos of rice! Gotta chip in from our allowances Maybe later... Go for it, kid Shit I told you not to Life is tough, huh? Tough... We should've bought some meat Our first day... No supper Everybody Yuji The rice isn't exactly new, but it's still fine for eating Wow! Thanks, Yuji Thank you! Saved! A friend in need is a friend indeed Here you are Thank you Say Did Shoichi say anything? No, nothing How do we cook it? In this We'll put a cutting board on top You're hopeless Sorry Don't ask for more Yes, thank you Nothing beats the smell of cooking rice Hey, Shoichi Tokie said she, ll be waiting for you at 6PM at The Ship the night of the Star Festival "My star-crossed beloved," "across the Milky Way..."

Tokie, this is on the house Enjoy Shoichi san's late But it sounds like an interesting theme They're having a special feature on Akira at... A swindler on the run. Caught cheating at a gambling den, has his sister turn him in for being a Christian and he's imprisoned That's how the story starts He escapes the gangsters but won't he be crucified as a Christian? Didn't you know about the image of Christ? If you refuse to step on it in court, you're crucified, but if you step on it. You're acquitted He steps on the image of Christ? That's what he thought But in jail, he meets a sweet Christian girl and falls head over heels, this swindler does What an idiot So. He wagers with the girl They roll the dice over whether heaven really exists The swindler controls the dice, after all Exactly. So for the sake of the girl. He rolls the dice to come out for heaven Sartre's gamble. Right? Exactly, existentialism Let me take a look 'Apocalypse - the Image of Christ ' What. It's just the title page? One step at a time They're all waiting for a weird sound Here comes the weird sound You ditched Tokie? For me now, she's a waste of time and money What's up?

Shimokawa san I don't mind at all Even if this painting isn't of me, I'm not at all disappointed I doubt the woman in this painting actually exists If she does exist, it's only inside your heart She lives in the world of your sad imagination I sought you out, because this painting fascinates me Shimokawa san I've taken a job At a bar. Called Olympiad, in Shinjuku Why don't you guys stop by sometime You've gotten so pretty, Tokie Take care Married? Yes To that woman who came to see you? Yes Actually, we were talking at The Ship this whole time And I realized that I need her and she told me that she needs me I figure I'll go for it Right Time for you to fly off In any case, I'll move out tomorrow and start a new painting in her country house in Karuizawa Karuizawa... Her country house... Looking back, I wish I hadn't sold that painting Yamagishi san got 40,000 yen for Get her to buy it back Which gallery did he sell it to? I'll ask him, right away I'd appreciate that I hope the price hasn't gone up Not much, at least I can tell you now... What's that? A pawn tag?

You're all here What's up? Well... Shimokawa san, that woman you had that long conversation with... Yes, we're getting married Oh... You didn't know after all It's true she studied French literature at some first rate university, and it's also true her father was an admiral in the Navy After he died in the war, her family was reduced to selling off their large property piece by piece After her fiancé died on a snowy mountain, she's never been the same These days, she greets dejected young men at the train station at sunset, and offers to marry them I've... had it "The frog walked on, through the wind ' "I've been wondering for the longest time," "what is the purpose, ' "of my life here" "I never knew" "Now." "Finally, I think." "I do" Wow This is the masterpiece you spent your whole summer on? I can't take on this kind of masterpiece If you keep on writing children's manga like this, you really will run out of work Hello Hey! Yamakawa Hello Already finished? Yes Oh. Hello Get him some tea No. Wait Would you prefer coffee? The gallies are in and everyone loves them Oh, really? Maestro Kajikawa's thrilled Wants to work with you again That's wonderful Let's see your new work What'll it be Ma'am? Two jam-rolls What are you writing? My will Your will?

We packed your bag Your train ticket to Uozu, and a little cash If you hurry, you'll make the midnight train The Ship guy packed a sandwich for you I'm sure your mother's waiting Hurry Here, read this on the train Thank you so much for all you did I'll never forget, the summer we spent, in your place It's very sudden. But I bid my farewell with this letter Do you remember? When you came back from your assistant's job in July? Back then, you asked us, "What is freedom?" I remember that I told you, freedom is doing what you please, as you please Eisuke does manga, Ryuzo does novels, Shoichi does pop songs I do oil painting Now summer's over, and I've quit painting just like Ryuzo's given up writing How ironic that our season of doing what we please has caused us to abandon just that We can't just live for paintings and novels If someone's there, we can't help but do something for them When we're alone, we step out to find company We're just weak willed, ordinary human beings We were just ordinary human beings There'll never be a summer like this again Never again, will we shed, the tears we cried this summer Never again In parting, I'll let the French poet Ryuzo taught us about. Express our words of farewell In the face of my life all I can do is panic, such is my useless and pathetic youth Now, what we acquire along with our first wrinkle is our trust in life, this consent. And this smile which says, Friend, I know all about you Looking back. We will learn Life never deceives man Life... has never deceived man I say it again Thank you so much for all you did Thank you Hey. Stray How've you been? See ya Come in This man came to see you last week When I told him you'd gone home to your sick mother, he said he'd be back "Nishigaki Tsutomu, ' 'Manga King? ' How's your mother?
