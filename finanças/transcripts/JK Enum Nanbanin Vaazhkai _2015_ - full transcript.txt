Why C2H? Why this Cinema to home? Requirement leads to changes Needs brings about revolution C2H is similar to these two created because of the needs and requirements Cinema! has entertained you all these years through theatres But off late, now, in the past decade through many platforms like TV, Laptops Ipads, Mobiles Internet... it has reached you through several mediums But still Tamil film fraternity, Tamil cinema Is still narrowed down to just the theatres No one has come out of the shell and taken it to all these mediums Even when few have tried they've been stopped by few citing business motives But that motive and the interruption is a profit only for them Whereas Creators like me, us, it is neither a business nor freedom nor profit it makes us stagnant, hopeless and lost drowning us in failure few instance To break this, to bring back our happiness And bring our creations to you all Is why we formed C2H I've thanked everyone many times When you all highly appreciated it All these times I've been thankful But this thanks... Is above all others Because this is not about just one person or one family But it involve the lives of millions of creators The life of such creators through C2H Eradicating the DVD piracy Leading to the triumph of truth and honesty My whole hearted thanks to you The first movie that I present through C2H is a movie directed by myself, "JK Ennum Nanbanin Vazhkai" A movie made with lot of responsibilities, worries and belief There are many changes in a youth's life Every stage of life the situation changes him accordingly But when a youth takes up an aim or a dream and runs towards it, nothing will deviate him, nothing can! Such is the story of "JK Ennum Nanbanin Vazhkai" Every youth has a responsibility by birth It could be politics, Or Film making Or achieving greater goals But there is something beyond that which is the responsibility towards his parents, siblings, his wife and kids How did JK fulfill all his responsibilities is all about it. This talks about the world of the youths How does it? This is not a linear story as a writer that is what impressed me The way he has narrated the story in the non-linear way he has created this movie with modern aesthetics For youth who think fun and celebration is life It's not just that This life has a meaning For every doings there is a reason and justification to it To find that meaning of life and executing it is each ones responsibility Beautifully with commercial content... in a very natural and subtle way he has presented it That is why we have chosen it to be C2H's first movie Life of a Friend called JK JK?

Just focus it on Blue. I have got an appointment to interview Rudra Sir. I am Jayakumar from Ananda Vikatan. Hello sir, Mr. Jayakumar from Ananda Vikatan Sir, your company is one among the top pioneers in construction industry. Could you please brief us about your success path. Stop it Sir! Who are you Sir? We are from CMDA. - Hello Sir! - Hello! Could you tell us the problems you encounter in this apartment? Real Estate! Plus points! Minus Points! Sir, your company is one among the top pioneers in construction industry. Could you please brief us about your success path. My career success credits go to my team. A very very brilliant and efficient team. And particularly finance. Initially we just took small scale projects. But I was able to deliver the projects at the correct time and hence was able to repay the finance in right time. That helped me in sanctioning loans for my next projects. On time delivery of projects and On time repayment of loans is the backbone for my success. And then of course hard work. Work! Work! Work! For the past 30 years I have never rested. Until every project gets completed, I never thought about.. .. sleep, family, entertainment just hard work. Hard work never fails and I am one among the few. More than everything it's the opportunities. Few call it as time and few others call it as luck. I just capitalised on every opportunity. I didn't worry about certain projects slippage. I just believed to excel in my future opportunities. That 'Hunger to excel' is what made this company the biggest company today. Could you tell us the problems you encounter in this apartment? When we moved in we had good ventilation, But now it's impossible to stay without an Air Conditioner. They promised us to provide an ambience with trees and park. There is no maintenance and it's difficult to find labourers. Labour Problem. This is my dad's house and it was okay then, But now it's just boxes and we want to shift. Looking for something new other than apartments. Apartment is surrounded by buildings. Windows view just have buildings in sight. What a life Sir? To this Water scarcity as well. We wake up every morning looking for metro water lorries. - Whom are you looking for? - Padmanabhan Sir. Sir, I am waiting at your home. Have come out with my family to temple. Should be back in 2 hours. - Sir wants to speak to you. - What he want? Actress Anushka needs a kiss right now, Do please kiss her on the phone. Do speak to Sir. Do ask them to be seated in the living room. You guys come soon. They have asked for a loan to start a real estate business. His dad is my friend, hence asked him to come home. Don't get into any trouble with such loan recommendations. Bro, this doesn't look like a bank manager's house. Looks like a clumsy slum. Both husband and wife are office goers. They don't have time to keep it tidy. Believe he has got more interest for the bank, rather than the house interest. It's better if he has one wife for bank accounts and one wife for household chores. Who said it's the wife who should clean the house? Hey, come here. Why are you picking those liquor bottles? Keep it there. What are they doing? Guys, what are you trying to do? Gonna mix vodka and wine and give a shot for you. Just come here and hold this. Nothing is kept in the proper place. Just move backwards. Why are you whistling like a bus conductor to move this backwards. Hey, tell me what we are going to do? Why are you piling up books like a brick wall? What the hell are you doing? Hereafter have to switch of my phone on Sunday's to stay away from him. Bring the books here. Aligning the books! Look at the way the two elders are starring at us. Will send us out very soon. Have to find my way out. Oh! that's the way to hell. Everything looks clean and tidy here. - Hello Sir. - Be seated. House is shining like a star hotel. How did this happen Dad? These guys only. They didn't listen at all. Sir, we worked so hard to tidy up this place. Both the elders had 3 cups of coffee sipping and starring at us. But never offered us one cup of coffee. You want to have a coffee, right? - Give us three coffee. - Let it be a filter coffee. Now things are all in place. You asked for a loan to do real estate business. But you have got different talents within you. Have aligned the books gracefully. You have got a wonderful talent. I always wish to have my house like this. But... Both are office goers. Parents have become old. Unable to maintain the house. You guys have set it up beautifully. Very Nice! - Jayakumar can you do me a favour? - Sure Sir. Why don't you do the same once in every week? Sorry Sir.lf I have to do it on a weekly basis then you have to pay me. How much you expect? Weekly once, monthly four times, pay me 5000 rupees Sir. Superb! No problem. But I just can't do it for your house. If I could get 10 houses that will be possible Sir. Don't worry! There are 140 houses in this block. I will represent this in my association. Most of the people are office goers. Hence should say okay. First start with this business as it's a no mans land. So you will get many offers and more income. - You can get into real estate later. - Okay sir. We are here to clean your bathrooms.. Why have you changed like this dude? You were earning well right? Isn't Rs.35000 a month sufficient for you? I can clearly see our future in my eyes. If we do such things, we shall end up joining the.. ..City's Corporation and start cleaning the drains. Totally 140 houses. Then, for a week 35 houses to clean. Per day 5 houses. Per house Rs.5000. So for 140 houses? 140 into 5000 is 7 lakhs. So per day income 23000. A house where parents can stay permanently. 2 sister's marriage, Brother's education, His future. I need to run for these. Don't think. Need to earn money. Start this first. You can't grow big in one business. How is it possible? How can we allow unknown people into our house for cleaning? Nobody knows their caste or background. If you keep checking for caste, you won't get anybody to clean the utensils. A guy who worked in my relative's house stole Rs.10000 worth silk saree. - Where do we find him? - He'll come back to steal the blouse, catch him then. - You speak a lot. - No, I just spoke 4 lines. Stay quiet man. Sir? Will only gents come to clean or will ladies come too? Sure. Nepal women will lock the doors and clean everything. - They will beat you till the broomstick breaks. - Please wait brother. We are all office goers. If we leave by 8 in the morning, in this traffic, it gets almost 10 in the night when we reach home. Because of this, we are not able to keep our home clean. What do we do then? We burn our money in the weekend eating at five star hotels. Instead, why can't we change our homes like the five star hotels? Please don't interrupt when I speak. We just came to clean the dust and garbage right? They are creating so many issues as if we were constructing a nuclear plant. - Let them suffer in their garbage. Let's go. - Just wait. How can we manage all these complaints? Moreover.. Due to water shortage, unclean surroundings, bad health. We spend a lot of money every month to the doctor. To keep our surroundings clean, there is nothing wrong in spending just Rs. 5000. Those who agree, please raise your hands. - Who do you want? - Is Nithya there? - You are? - JK. Nithya's schoolmate. Ma'am, someone called JK is here for you. - Hi Nithya. - JK? Hmmm. Why have you come uninformed? You could have at least called right? If you didn't know my number, then fine? It is thrilling if I come unannounced. I don't like such thrills. Don't come uninformed in the future. I thought you changed your contact number. Hey, I have not changed my number. One second. Danny. Sit. Sit like a good boy. I have left a work half finished in my room on top. I will call my mom. Parimala. Please give water. Hey Nithya, it won't come near right? - It won't. - Does it know Tamil or English? Malayalam. I've informed mom. Sit freely. It won't hurt you. Why Nithya? You have kept your house beautifully. This dog doesn't suit this house. This dog doesn't suit this house? Is there a rule for which dog should be in which house? It is an animal. It roams on the roads and streets. Can you have that in the house? If it's an animal? Shouldn't it be at home? If you don't like it, you don't come to my house. No one should comment on my Danny. Welcome son. My mother. I can realise when I see her. Why an intro? You sit mom. Hey. that. If you leave it open there will be dust all over. Should a home be like this? So bright? Like a marriage hall? There should be minimum light. Okay? Parimala. Get coffee please. You please sit down. If you keep it closed like this, how will humans live here. Is this a museum? To keep it closed, put a focus light and all. If all books are in order, it is as if you've kept it for a show and not for reading. If people should believe, then you should keep it scattered like this. Hey, what are you doing? - only then you'll be thought a geek - JK what are you doing? JK please stop doing this. Please. Go sit down, please go and sit down. I don't like keeping books like this JK. I like to keep my books in order. And, this is my shelf. You said you studied fashion designing. Your taste for colour is bad. Not only colours. Even these wall hangings are not right. See, this should not be here. If it was there it will look good. This. this radio. very very old. As per vaastu this shouldn't be here. I think we should change. What's your problem? Your attitude is not right since you came? This is my house. Which should be where is my decision. This is not your place. Old? Even your parents are old. Change them as per vaastu. - Nithya, don't get angry. - Stay quiet mom. I don't like being usual. If I were usual, you would not have asked so many questions. So please. sit. drink coffee. And leave. Hey, can I use your laptop? - Hmm. - Thanks. Dear Nithya. you are appointed as a working partner in JK Clean and Green Company.. ..which is going to start from the second week of this month. Mom. All he did was a drama. See here. He has sent me an appointment letter to join in his company. Take earnest steps to reach the sky.. Reach the sky and go beyond.. Take earnest steps to reach the sky.. Knock the doors and it shall open.. Every earnest plan will win! Take earnest steps to reach the sky.. - Excuse me. - Nithya.. - I know you'd come. Welcome - Hi JK. This is our office. - Its very beautiful - Guys. - She's Nithya, my schoolmate and my friend. - Hi. please sit. Henceforth, Nithya also will be working with us as a team. From today, she's one of the partners of JK Clean and Green company. What JK, you say her a friend? I have never seen her ever with you before. He would have ditched you whenever he went to meet her. When has he introduced beautiful women before? He would introduce only ugly girls till now. Hi. By the by. I'm Thothadri. - Do you drink a lot of fruit juices? - Why? You glow like a skinned pineapple. That's why I had asked. Friends. you all are the heart of this JK Clean and Green company. The growth of the company depends on how you work We, instead of working for salary, should work for our satisfaction, creatively.. Doing hard work, till the company reaches a good position, nobody gets leaves. Yes, nobody should ask for leave. Suppose, unavoidable circumstances. If there is no other option, if you got to go and booze with.. ..your friends on a saturday night, then you may take leave. Right dude? For such drunkards, there is no work here. Then, only you would work here. Because we can find even a dog that doesn't bite but can't find a mouth that doesn't drink. Hey, hey, go. - Sorry sir, sorry sir. - you were asked to mop the floor not the girl. - Go wash your face first. - Sorry sir. - Madam. - What happened? What happened madam? Nothing. I'm okay. Go to your work. If you purchase a 3 bedroom flat, with all other facilities, specially, we'll give 2 years free service of JK Clean and Green group. Come to eat son. To leave a job and start a business, there will be a meaning in that. To keep doing the same job everyday for Rs.35000 salary like a machine. I don't like it. I should work a lot For my happiness and creativity. When can we settle in this city life with Rs. 35000 a month earning? For all of us to be happy, I should earn much more, quickly. That's my plan dad. - Hey hold this file, it's urgent. - Go and come fast. Dude, when it's a saturday you bring us out for relaxation right, that's why we are your best friends. Hey, we are not here to relax, we are here to discuss our new project. Hey, this looks like a tribal forest. You say you want to do a project here? Hey what else you want to do here? Here.. we should construct separate villas here. .in between if we had plants, trees. How would it be? Yes Nithya, this is our plan. New city, green city, JK City. - Super, New project - No apartments. Only villas. Did you both already decide on this before? Or both of you showing off as if you both are in the same wavelength? Why do you tease man? We are discussing for our growth right? Aren't we growing now? Hey, young people should get high drinking on a saturday. Instead you are discussing about building a flat. We shouldn't miss this. -yes - JK tell us your idea. If the first house is here, then the second house is 25 feet away. This is the JK Sweet Home's model house sir. We have planned each and everything in this. please see. Without being stuck inside the house, to walk around the house, lot of space. Inside the house, with lot of windows, with good ventilation and light, to speak to a guest heartily, there is a huge hall. Without being allergic to the eye, to cook happily a clean and modern kitchen. Bedroom with soothing colours to fall asleep soon. To stay healthy and fit by swimming there is a swimming pool. We will have power crunch in the future. To manage that, we have automatic on/off switch. To save energy during day, every house will have a solar back up. Well planned, Good. Yes sir, by constructing 300/400 apartments, instead of playing together as a family. They carry plastic buckets to collect water from water tankers. This scene will not be there at JK Sweet Homes. By constructing homes one over the other, If one person opens his bedroom window, he can see the bathroom next door, If the bathroom opens, he can see the kitchen next door. Such problems are not there here. The problems you foresee in the future, the comforts required for a comfortable living now, without looking just at the business, you have planned it for the peaceful life of the people living there. Superb. So many of them have come? Don't know who is a producer in this. These all look like assistant directors. White & White, then he is the producer. - Sir, hello sir. - Hello, hello. Sir, please read the paper. - Sir, Ma'am and Sir are getting ready. I'll get them here. - That's okay. - Please switch on the A/C - I'll do sir Oh... I forgot to switch on A/C Hey, he thinks I'm a film producer. Now you realise the respect for an all white attire? You guys were teasing me about it? Sir, Sir and Ma'am are coming. - Hello Sir - Hello - Hello Ma'am - Hello - Hello - Hi Hey. Thank You. - Thank You. - Please sit down. Tell me. You do lot of ads. You support lot of children's trusts. This is our first business. In this plan, we have clean, green surroundings, for good living, we have included all that is required. And planned very well. It would be great if you both do an ad for us, for this project to be a success. This is our first step as youngsters. If we get your support for this, it will be helpful. Yes ma'am, we won't ask you to wear sunglasses and.. ..and make you stand near a fence and say.. "Tambaram, near 100ft road, bus stop nearby. Railway station behind the house. Airport in eyes view." We won't ask you to make such a bad ad. We have made a decent ad. Unlike other builders, we are not charging on square feet basis. We have equally divided all the cost between all the houses. We have maintained 10 lakhs as margin per house. In this, there will 90 houses. In 2 years this plan will be complete. Take earnest steps to reach the sky.. Reach the sky and go beyond.. Take earnest steps to reach the sky.. Knock the doors and it shall open.. Every earnest plan will win! Take earnest steps to reach the sky.. You dreamt to become Big.. You supported your dreams with blood, heart and sweat.. Consider every obstacle as a stepping stone to success You've got a body to live.. And the confidence to win.. - Useless Idiots. - Who are you scolding at? In this traffic, I've went to Besant Nagar in a two wheeler and come back empty handed. Why? What happened? 6 months work schedule is completed for them. They have yet not released the payments. Can you prepare a notice to send to them? What happened? Why are you breathing like this? Here, do you want water? Wait for a moment please. Nithya! Nithya, what happened? - Look here. Relax. - I'll meet you on Thursday. Okay. I'll call you back. - Hey, what happened? - Look here. - What happened Nithya? - Are you fine? -You are alright? Okay? - Water? - No, she refused. Painting. Superb. What's your name? Looks like you both spoke to each other this morning and started to work. Yes, how do you know? Like senior government bus drivers, both of you have turned up in blue dress. - If you had told us, we would also worn the same right? - Hey, I never noticed. Morning. It's okay, but, we are going to need all the pros and cons of your project. I'll discuss with my colleagues - Hello. - We need to start urgently. - We need to finish by September. - We've already finished 2 projects. Actually, we had asked to give all the project files Nithya, what happened? You are fine? That. Nithya. Any problem? Sorry, JK, I'm not able to concentrate. I'll just come back. - Please ask Naveen to come. - Okay. - Wow! - Wow! Hey, this shirt design is great right? Hey I asked sir about this. This is a designer shirt it seems. In the entire world, there are only 7 people who own such a shirt. - JK? - Hmm. In our office, after Viswaroopam movie, it is only your shirt which is spoken the most. Who designed this? Nithya. She had designed this. I thought so. Even if today's girls know cooking or not, they know well to confuse. She made everyone to speak right? That's success. - I liked it. - Hmm. Hmm. You've got 1365 likes and 140 comments. Since I liked your shirt designs, I took pics and posted it in FB. Please check which all apartments have sent offers for Clean and Green and chart out. - Similarly, from where all.. - Hi Nithya. - Hi. - For you. - For what? - For your new thought and creativity. In Facebook, 1365 likes and 140 comments for your designer shirts. So liked it. Keep it up. - Good. - Thank You. - It is difficult for our staff to travel daily. - We have allocated vehicles. In all approved places, please check if we have space to open our branches. - Sure, I'll take care. Good morning Nithya. - Hi, Good morning. JK? - This is for you. - What is this? What is this? Wow. This is superb right? Thank you JK. The same bouquet you gave yesterday. It gave me a chance to say thanks to you today. - Nice. - What Nithya, by thinking different, by designing differently, you are rocking? - Don't you have any other work at home? - Please don't tease me. No Nithya, that day you designed those 7 shirts differently. Today, with bouquet you have designed so creatively. Superb. Simply Superb. Friends, nowadays in our city, for birthday, marriage, for exam success, for promotion, whatever it is, its become common to give a bouquet. But, everything is in the same style, that is our point. Whatever you do differently, it'll attract everybody. For birthday, one type, one colour. For promotion another type. For old people, for children, different colours. If we do different colours and designs like this in variety like this, people who buy the bouquet will also be happy about it. So, this is going to be our next project. First, let's open one shop. We'll import variety of flowers from abroad. If we maintain a team and develop daily we will arrange something. Fantastic, super dude. - Such a bouquet shop idea will work definitely. Good. - Thank you. No JK, I think we are taking a huge risk by this. Yes JK, already our company is working in 2 different genres. This is extra. There is minimum chance for success. Our work load will also increase. We don't rely on the manpower and work. We work creatively. So, only if we directly involve in this, we can succeed I think. Actually, when we concentrate on one, the other may go into losses. I think we should think again. I don't think so, there are so many companies which do 4 or 5 companies. No Vishwak, you can't see all businesses like that, it's wrong. No chance, we don't have such experience. Don't say just for the sake. Hey, wait, he wants to say something looks like. Wow. Super. Super. Super sir. Thank you. This is very surprising. JK Flowers for Love. How did you start this? How did you get this idea? Please share it with us. JK will say. - You say Nithya. - Hey you say. No that's okay, you speak. Thank you. Thanks a lot. For everything. For showing my identity to myself. My heart knows what you speak, And your heart knows what I speak. Our silence knows what we speak, Even the silence speaks million languages. Your silence is the best language in this world. My life is a shrub along the railway track, Your hands protected me from sun and rains. Ocean and Rivers are all from Rain drops. We both fall under the same clouds. Certain relationship in life blossoms in the middle of the life span. Once blossomed we complete our other half of the life span. Your silence is the best language in this world. Your silence is the best language in this world - Please tell me sir, which child? - Girl child. - What age? - 6 years. - Any favourite for her chocolates or ice creams? - Yes, chocolates. - Okay is she going to school? - She is in her 2nd standard. Name is JK Sweet Homes. I want all the details about them. Okay. Bye. Sir, in 2 days, your wish will happen. Well.. By destroying all, It is not necessary for one good guy to live. Cheers. Good morning. In JK Sweet Homes all villa designs are ready. We need to call the owners and get their opinion. After that we can take further steps. In such a big Chennai city, a man is unable to urinate in public. So much pressure. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hey, what new project is it? - No, no. - I've got a new project today. - Tell me. - What project? Like Mobile Court, Mobile Library, Mobile Urinal Van. Will this project succeed? Definitely, in our city there are lot of people with diabetes. They need to urinate 5 minutes once. We will have good collection in this business. Will someone pay Rs. 3 to urinate? When someone pays Rs. 120 for a beer, won't they pay Rs. 3 to urinate. I'm sure, we can grow big with this urine business. No Thotha, it's a big problem, and tension. Maintaining this is very difficult. Then there is government. We are not sure if they would allow this. So... We can discuss this later. - Hmm, girls brother has come. - Hello. - This is my son Jaya Kumar. - Welcome son. - Hello Ma'am. Hello Sir. - Come. Did you get stuck in traffic? - Sorry Dad. - He is the eldest. - Oh, hello. Sorry, I got delayed at work. - How are you? - Does the groom like the bride? Aunty, juice please? I'll take later, this is like our house. Our building is near to Grand chola wilford farma. After this Iam planing to go to Bombay. Hey go. Go away.. What dowry will you give? What's your expectation? Your wish. Whatever you feel will match my status, give us that much dowry. Why are you like everybody else? Can't you find a good groom who does not take dowry? Please wait. Why this hurry? 50 Sovereigns of Gold, a car, a house. Why? Doesn't the groom have a house already? Is he a beggar? Fine. what are you planning to do for Rs. 50 Lakhs? How much is there in Clean & Green? Take that amount. If money cannot help us when in need, then it is just a paper. The only paper a man does not dispose off in a dustbin is money. Only now the company is growing. And, in this development stage of the firm, it is not good to take money from the firm. That is not the right method. In what confidence did you agree to your father? Time does not wait for anyone. Whatever has to be done. Has to be done at the correct time. - Yes! - Mr. Jaya kumar, we are calling from the CMDA approval committee. - Please tell me. - You have taken permission to construct 90 villas in Sholingar right? - Yes sir. - Have you started that project? - We will start in October sir. - Please stop it immediately. Sir, already. sir, we have sold everything sir. This is Government order sir, please stop the work immediately. Hey, whoever it is, if you want work done, you have pay under the table. - We need to speak to you. - What do you want? Hmm, we need some tamarind and turmeric. JK Sweet Homes.why did you ask to stop this project? As I said, government order. There is a plan for ring road in that area. When? Show me the order? In the future. Future? Are you a Mayan calendar to predict the future? Look here. I don't know anything. Stop your project, if you want to know more on this, meet Rudra Builders MD, Mr. Rudratchagan. Why should we ask him? If he wants, he can ask the government to change its plans. The Government is in his hands. Is the government a handbag, for him to hold in his hands? Who is he man? - People have come from JK Sweet Homes to meet sir. - Send them. - Send them. - Just one person can go. Like Government hospitals, can't you take money and send us all in? No, we have come for a meeting, how can just one person go? It is yet not late. Leave that place. And run away. I'll take care. Else, you will have capital loss. People who gave loans for the land, the house, will come to you as your nightmares. You can't give answers to every one of them. You have no capacity to handle any losses. I have the capacity. So, if you leave it as is. Tension free. - JK? - JK? - Wait. Okay Sir, I'll let it go. You finish it in your construction brand. But, how much will you give me? JK? Why should I give you money? Sir. If we earned it straight, in this project we would have got Rs. 7 Crores. In your company, your experience will cross earnings of Rs.70 crores in this. I know that. Brilliant. I'll give you Rs. 2 Crores. Run away. Never come to this business again. We are not here to do service or sacrifice to people. In fact, There is no leader here to do that. That is business here. Love it or Leave it. Sir, I'm not bothered about it. We are seven of us. We have struggled for 6 months. 2 Crores is not enough. In this, our idea, brains everything is involved. Okay. For your brains, is 2 more Crores sufficient? Money. Money. Money. Damn Money. Wrong move. Yes JK, like breaking the bottle when the beer is opened, you've decided urgently without consulting us. You know how many crores we lost? Did you get afraid of him JK? In this, he won. but we did not lose. 4 Crores. for 7 of us, it's profit in 6 months. Actually this is success for us. In this we have Rs. 57 lakhs each. Now, this is our investment and this is our first victory. He has money and man power. We have only brains. We cannot win over him. Instead of losing everything to him, I thought this is a better option. JK Sweet Homes was all our dream right? That plan is lost right? No one can destroy JK Sweet Homes. Ring Road will come in Chennai only right? It won't come in all cities right? We'll try next one. Then for that ad too, will Sneha come again? - Hey, what's your problem? - God. He is all Sneha, Sneha. Always, you keep thinking of Sneha, but not about our company profits. We'll remove him from our partnership and make him a security guard at Sneha's house. JK, I'm okay with your plan? What about you guys? - Actually. - Hey, say it shortly. I'm okay with this. What happened? You are all awake this late? - In our village, there was a post man uncle, father's close friend. - Yes. - He passed away today. - Oh my. He was the only one there. He too passed away. Death. Never waits for anyone. I have started fearing for me now. It's not very far. In this rush to earn money for us. You never get time right? If I die, we can't live together right? That's what. Please. Please. Spend some time with me. Dad. You said big project and you are standing here? This sea water. we'll clear everything and we'll construct an apartment here. To clear the water. Work for a million people. To construct the apartment. Work for another million people. Are you teasing? - Get to the point. - Then what? Why? Why are you running like this? Enough JK. To eat lifelong, we have a good business already. We'll definitely get profits. Still you are running searching for money. You just keep running. I don't understand why. One day. One day. To roam care free with you. Is it possible? We need you as a friend JK. You gave the confidence to everyone. I have cardiac asthma. you don't know. I was very weak initially. The confidence you gave me. Threw out my weakness. How many days has it been since you opened the Facebook? Open and check it. How people are looking for you. 'Where is JK? Why is he not here?' You are not living for you. All the time you spent happily. You have lost it. Nithya. Nithya please. Nithya. What happened? Nithya, we'll go to the hospital. Come. Nithya, I understand. Just few more days, I neared my target. Once I reach it, after that, as you expect me to, I shall become very sober and silent. Please excuse me Nithya. Is everything alright doctor? Her condition is very serious. She has Cardiac myopathy. Now, her breathing will be already very strained. It is below 20%. Now the heart will be weak and swollen. We have to do a heart transplantation, there is no other option. - Hello. - Brother. I'm Ravi's sister speaking. Are you fine? Here we are in distress.

The world has developed a lot. You are responsible for this destruction. To have created and had a lot of dreams all their life. His parents are going to come. What are you going to tell them? Your friend is lying inside. As a dead body. If you were in that place. Our family and! would have been crying here. Did you think? A father's fear, even a son will never know.

Hereafter I have to travel faster. The colours are good in this invitation card. Keep it aside. This one is bit sophisticated. This one is same as before, Keep it there. This card.. ..design is good but has a shade of north indian style. Dad, Apartments at Anna Street and Besant street are beyond our budget. For our budget we can only get it outside the city. Brother, if it is outside the city, it will be difficult for my fiance to go to work. Look at the way she speaks. Instead of supporting her father and brother.. ..to reduce the expenses. She is more worried about the son in law's drive to work. Hope you listened to her. All the daughters behave like this. Only the son's are going to stay with us till the end. What did you just say? You always support them. I hate you daddy. Do apologise to me. Even I fought with my dad to marry you. That time you were so happy. I was an idiot then. As if not now. Sister, what would we be left with if we are gonna spend everything on you. Just take away what we give. - I am gonna beat you. - Hey Viji.. Just give your husband and you can take everything. What!

Son in law's family have arrived. Welcome! Welcome Son-in-law. Greetings! Please come. Let's go inside. - Look here. - Hi Partha. Sister's wedding is over.

Obviously were born together and Got separated in a small issue. That's a boring flashback. Where is he right now? Upstairs with Ganesh. Oh! I will go and speak to him. Bye. Butter! Look here. Bye! Bye! - Hello Doctor. - JK We have got a chance to save your friends life. We have got a 14 years boy heart with same blood group as Nithya's. In an accident his brain is dead and they are ready to donate the heart. The trees along the path The tree is full of flowers The flower is filled with seeds The earth in which the seed grows is calling for you Your soul is calling for you Life is full of experiences, Do enjoy the experiences. Every human is precious Each heart has a pin in it We share the breath of many others Each breath travels over seas, Shores and mountain Many others prayers for this short life of yours Life is full of experiences, Do enjoy the experiences. The food you eat Do you know who cultivated it? In the pursuit for money in this life Would you return that favor The butterflies wings shows the beauty of the creator The mystery to hide the end of the human life Thanks! - Please come. - Hi Nithya. - Good Morning! - Good Morning! - Are you fine? - Yeah fine. Yeah just discharged. Have started. They have come. They are waiting there. They are... Now I can sense two lives within me I have no answer for the tears of her mother Emotions have no language and it is no sin to express your emotions No space to find our place again. Life is full of experiences, Do enjoy the experiences. Every human is precious. House is very beautiful. It's wonderful! - But bit expensive right? - Nothing to worry dad. Should have 30 to 40 floors. Look at the height. Yes sister. Both of you like the house. Just love it. But the college is very far. But you have got the college bus here. This place is really good. This is the place where you are going to live. And you? Me as well dad. It's a dream come true. We have seen flock of other country birds flown in and out of our country. We will be surprised to see them and think.. ..How these birds have flown across the world. Bird's life has got one more astonishing news. Bird's natural death. Till now no one has seen bird's natural death. In all living beings birds are the only creature which can foresee it's death. A bird which has foreseen its death will move out of the flock and.. .. will die without causing any concerns to it's flock, states some research. Birds are flying across thousands of miles to seek food and shelter. Without affecting the self belief and confidence of the other birds, Their character which makes them stay away and die alone is a nature's gift. One day! Just one day! Is it possible to roam around with you? So Nithya, this whole week I will be with you. I just asked for one day. No! I am gonna roam one week with you. Just for me and for you as well.. We don't know where our life came from. We don't know where our life goes after death. Nothing is ours in this life. Human brain cannot race over this life. No one can foresee the future. But everyone have their attraction towards life. Vision through our eyes doesn't visualises truth. Don't predict your future changes. Changing visuals doesn't get lost from eyesight. Being blind doesn't stop you from dreaming. Sun rises in the morning and goes to sleep in the evening. Moon rises in the evening and fades away in the morning. Don't trust your eyes as changes happens in life. We don't exist if there isn't any changes. Our life wouldn't be there if love is a sin. Life is all about search for your needs. Changing visuals doesn't get lost from eyesight. Being blind doesn't stop you from dreaming. We are bounded by hundreds of rules. No idea to standby which rules. Our paths are filled with humps and dumps. Don't know which path to travel though. Live like an island isolated from others. But world is created by connecting places. Can't lead a life without support, Living individually doesn't complete your life. What made you think about my operation? Fear of my death, right? Never fear for death. Death is gonna come someday. Let it come. We have to face it. I am not scared. All of a sudden someone whom we likes disappears, it hurts us right? Accept it! Just accept that separation. That's nature. Don't worry I won't die. Changing visuals doesn't get lost from eyesight. Being blind doesn't stop you from dreaming We don't know where our life came from. We don't know where our life goes after death. Nothing for sure in this life. Human brain cannot race over this life. No one can foresee the future. But everyone have their attraction towards life. Vision through our eyes doesn't visualises truth. Don't predict your future changes. - That was fun right? - Love to go again. We will go. This is how I can keep you happy Nithya. I have made you smile the whole week. I am content JK. This life and happiness, is all that you gave. What should I do for you? What can I give? You have to take care of my family. I mean till the end. You have to take position as the Director and take care of JK group of companies. Heard of fate? You are reading my fate Nithya. This is other side of my world. No one knows about it. For the past 2 years this triggered me in search of money. 6 months after Ravi's accident, One day.. You ever had a head injury? You had brain tumor already. Because of the head injury during the accident, tumor broke and started to bleed. Every time it bleeds you will faint. Your complete body hangs like a computer. You will loose consciousness. Once it stops bleeding, you will get your senses back. This is really dangerous Jaya Kumar. In fact the truth is you are traveling along with your death. It will come along with you. No doctors can cure this. Got no solution. Sorry My Dear boy! You have got a short life span. You have got maximum of 2 to 3 years left, For you to live in this world. Still few more days, Have almost reached my target. Once I reach that.. ..I will be so quiet and patient more than to your surprise. All of a sudden someone whom we likes disappears, it hurts us right? Nithya are you ready? Hi Dad! How are you? How is Mom? Best wishes for your Birthday. You gotta be healthy for many more years to come. Your son will always be there for you. Congrats! Very proud of you brother. On your degree completion and convocation. I am not able to be in person, But my support and prayers are always there for you. You have to study more and achieve more. Make sure you live your dream. For that to happen, capitalise on every minute you get. There is nothing impossible in this world. We can definitely succeed. Every one of them is born to achieve. All the best! Nithya, it's time for the flight. I can't believe your first pocket balance and current bank balance. Wow! What a transformation! Amazing. Have opened bank accounts and deposited money for family and friends. You have got nothing in your name. I really don't understand JK? Why have you registered all the companies in their individual names? Why are you going abroad for 3 years, all of a sudden? JK has got a reason for all his acts. Hope this has got it too. We are all friends. Money shouldn't separate us. This company shouldn't fail without friends. Put your signature. JK! This journey of yours perplexes me. Don't know if any human can do the same if he foresees death. But you have worked and achieved. If you can achieve this in a span of 2 years. If every common man can work throughout his life, just imagine what he could achieve. You are a greatest example to this society. You have proved that the eldest son of the family is the asset and capital. You haven't let down your family. Great! JK, In your company I will give my best to foster and develop more JK's. Take care my dear. I miss you. I am going to miss you. Love you. I don't have the courage to tell you this in person. Going to a new place, take care of your health. Do call us frequently. If not phone got skype.... What happened? What happened? Concentrate on your studies, okay. Don't worry I will excel like you. Do study well and become a doctor. Definitely a doctor no worries about it. You should always be happy. I am always don't worry about me. Take care of yourselves. Mom, dad has got Blood Pressure. Take good care of him. I will. Don't worry. Have a safe journey. It's gonna be a good journey son. Whatever you did and whatever you are gonna do, will be excellent. You will never suffer any hardships. Take care dad! Have the medicines regularly. As if he is gonna settle down there everyone is weeping. He is coming back in 3 years. It's getting late JK. You have a brave heart. All the best for your endless journey. Good Bye! What is this? Thank you! Please don't. Don't plan to open a clean and green branch there, as they are already clean. Dude! I will leave from here. Do call us once you reach. Ensure you get a non alcoholic passenger besides you. You are right, they will trouble you. No! We can order his quota as well and drink. Ok dude! All the best, take care and Bye! We will all miss him. Happy trip! Take care! Take care! see you. Going to miss you. - Okay take care! - He is been saying bye and take care for a while. - Bye JK. - Bye Nithya. - Good morning Mam! - Good Morning! In life parting from friends hurts more than parting from a lover. My friend JK made me feel that. You can have a new lover in your life, But you can never have the space of a best friend replaced by someone else. In my heart, that space would always be for my JK.
