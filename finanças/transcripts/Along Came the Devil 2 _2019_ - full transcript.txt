Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come... I will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven. And give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. Lead us not to temptation... but deliver us from evil. Amen. Mom? Dad? Mom? No! Mom! Dad! Help, help, please help! Jordan's coming home. Jordan? Jordan, you need to come home. Hey, this is Ashley, leave a message. Hey, Ash, it's Jordan, I just got a message from Aunt Tanya. She said I need to come home immediately? I'm really worried about you guys, so please just call me back as soon as you can. All right, I'm on my way, bye. Well... that's it. Fine. Why don't you head on over to Tanya's house now and clean up? Oh, here's the number and address of Jordan and Ashley's father, like you asked. Well, I hope he believes me. May peace be with you, Dr. Carraz. May peace be with you, Pastor John Douglas. Yes, I understand, Mark, but I need to know that you have the girls' best interests at heart. If you can assure me of that, I will do what I can. Well, yes, sir, I can assure you, most definitely. - Great, I'll see you soon. - Okay. I'm just really worried about them. I've been texting Ashley all morning and she hasn't gotten back to me yet. I'm sure everything is fine, okay? Nothing is gonna happen in this town without every person knowing about it. Do you know where you're staying? I don't even know, maybe my Aunt Tanya's house, I don't know. I'm working at the Lakeside Market in Flowery Ranch tomorrow morning. You should come by and see me. In the meantime, I'm gonna ask my brother and his friends if they know anything. Okay, thank you. And, yeah, I'll just catch up with you a little later, okay? Bye. Bye. You know, I don't know if I'm more nervous or excited to see Jordan today. Either way, I really do appreciate the olive-branch opportunity that both you and the Lord have presented me with. I just, I wish that I'd have reached out to Ash and Tanya a little earlier to let them know we were home. Maybe we could have helped out one way or another. Well, Dr. Carraz was insistent on taking them both out of town for a while, it's a part of the process. He knows what he's doing. Anyway, I'm glad you're here, girls need a father. Maybe it's time for you and Jordan to make amends. How long's it been since you seen your girls? Years. It's been years. Not for lack of trying, of course. I miss 'em, a lot. God knows I have not been the best father to the girls. That's why we're here though, make amends as best that I can. Things are different now, I'm changed. I got clean, I found God, found Karen, I've been saved. I just hope I have the opportunity to show the girls both that. So how are you and Karen settling in? Great. Karen, she's keeping me busy with the upgrades on the house, boy. Mm. I just wish that I could get out and find myself some time to get some paid work. You know, I'm a carpenter by trade, I can do just about anything, if you know of anybody who needs any help. Well, why don't you stop by the office sometime next week, maybe I can see if I can help you find some work. Reverend, I would appreciate that, more than you know. Here we are. You know, uh... Ashley's like her mother. She's like her mother? She has some of the same traits. She said the key would be under the mat. You said she has the same traits? How do you mean? Ashley is experiencing some of the same things as her mother did. Mental problems? I'm confused, Reverend. Jordan's here. Hey, what's going on? Is everything okay? Did something bad happen? Jordan, do you remember me? I'm Reverend Michael. Before she left, Tanya told me that you'd be coming here. She asked me to come by and help in any way I could, in case you were worried. So if she was worried, why isn't she picking up my calls? Well, Ashley has been having a few traumatic experiences. Tanya and Dr. Carraz decided to take her away for a little while, but it's gonna be all right. So you're back? That's what I heard. Yes, your father wanted to lend a hand, he's been worried about Ashley, and you. We've been back a little while. We felt best just to let you come back and us get settled before we called and reached out, let you know. I need to get inside. No, let me go in first. Jordan. Under the church. You okay? - I'm sorry. - I... I just... need to go. Jordan? Jordan? Jordan? Hey, Jordan? What is going on in there? Why is her room so different? Well, I don't know, but I know they were having trouble just before they left. Listen, Ashley hasn't been herself. She, uh... I am not leaving until I find her. That's understood. Hey, Jordan, Ashley, Tanya, and the doc, they're gonna be back soon. You are welcome to come and stay at the house, just until we get to talk to 'em. Yeah, that might not be a bad idea, dearie. Hmm? Just until we find her. Yeah. Yeah, this is great, I'm gonna call Karen, just to let her know that... - Yeah. - And, uh, listen, Here. It's my card. Call me, day or night, if you need anything. We're gonna head out by Old Mill Creek Road here and swing a right. About 15 miles down, the farmhouse is going to be on the right, just past Dottie's old place. You're not gonna believe how big Xander is now. Hey, um, I'm sorry that I didn't call to let you know I was in town. It all just happened so quick. Everything happens for a reason. In God's time. I am not gonna tell you both again, all right? I put you in here, and I want no talking. And I don't want you to think about leaving this fucking closet, do I make myself crystal clear? And don't make me come back one more time, because if I do, I swear to God, I'll grab that necklace around your fucking neck so fast... Now cover your ears, both of yous. When your mother passed away... that affected me in ways that... I couldn't explain. And I know I don't have to... You were there for that, all of it. I'm sorry. You know, you may hate me... you have every right to hate me... but if... if you could just somehow find it in your heart to even think about trying to let me back in again, I swear, as God is my witness, I will do the best that I can to make it up to you the rest of my life. I'm not gonna be here long enough for all that. I'm only here to find Ashley. - Good to see you. - Good to see you too! Wow, you're almost as tall as I am now. Jordan, we're so glad to have you. Look at how much you've grown. You're so beautiful. I made a bed for you upstairs. - Here, let me get your bag, we'll get you settled. - I'll hang onto it. - Can I show Jordan her room? - Yes, of course. - I'd love to see it. - I think someone's excited you're here. This is your room. And my room's right there, so you can come crash with me if you get scared. Thanks, Xander. Hey, honey, why don't you go get ready for dinner? Okay, Mom. Make yourself at home. I put fresh towels in the bathroom. You can stay for as long as you'd like. Thanks, Karen. Jordan, I'd really like for us to be good friends. And if you let me, I'd love to make up for lost times. I just really need to find my sister right now. Of course, of course. I can't imagine what you're going through. I just want you to know that you have family here for you, that I'm here for you. And if you need anything, just let me know. I will. Well, I'm gonna finish up dinner. Um, when you're done unpacking, can you grab Xander and bring him down? It's really nice to have you here. Are you crazy? No, I can't. - No. - Xander? What's wrong with you? Xander? Who are you talking to? Is dinner ready? Yeah. No, I'm a great singer, alright? Honey, this smells just amazing. Made my favorite. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hey, Karen, can I get anything for you? Yeah, why don't you go ahead and take the mashed potatoes? - Okay. - Hey, Mom, can I help you? Uh, yeah, go ahead and get that lemonade for me. Okay. Oh, here you go, honey. - Oh. - Okay, there you are. - Ooh! - Oh, careful. Careful, careful. - Here you are, Jordan. - Thank you. Nice. Okay. - Mmm. - Here we go. - Wow. - That smells delicious. - Mm-hmm. - I hope you're hungry. - Honey, you outdid yourself. - Yeah. Thank you guys for dinner. You're welcome. - Mm, mm, mm. - Xander, can you put your phone down? Hon, this is so good. - Glad you like it. - You've outdone yourself. So, Jordan, how are you liking college? It's good, real good. Do you have a major yet? Clinical psychology. Mm. Clinical psychology, huh? How'd you choose that? Guess I just wanted to dive a little deeper into our family problems. Well, I know that you are gonna do good at that major or anything else you put your mind to. Put your phone away, son. Have you heard anything regarding Tanya and Dr. Carraz and where they might've took Ashley? No, nothing yet. Don't you think that's strange, that they didn't tell anyone where they were going? It just doesn't make sense. Aunt Tanya left me a message this morning telling me to come home. I've been trying to reach them nonstop, and it just keeps going to voicemail. You know, the reverend, he told me something today that had me a little worried, he said that Ash is showing some similar signs as her mother, as far as mental disabilities. I'm so sorry. Well, she hasn't been diagnosed with mental illness, has she? My Aunt Susan was diagnosed with a mental illness, it's really not that uncommon. I heard it's hereditary. Have you heard that, Jordan, or read that, Jordan? Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me then. I lost my head. I'm honestly really tired, it's been a long day, so I'm just going to head on to bed. But, um, thank you so much for the lovely dinner. You know you're not supposed to have your phone at dinner. I'm sorry, Mom. We'll fix your phone. I'm gonna get that fixed tomorrow. Okay? Hey. I'm sorry, son. It's okay. Xander, why don't you go up and get ready for bed? Dang it. I know this isn't easy on you. It should be. I'm gonna go run upstairs and talk to him. Okay? I'm sorry. Chief, I'm sorry I overreacted at dinner like that. - It's okay, Dad. - No. No, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I, I acted out. I'm sorry. Sometimes when we do that, it's real important that we find our loved ones and we make good, soon as we can. - You understand? - Yes, sir. I'm sorry. It's okay. Let's say a prayer. Dear Father God, thank you so much for being with us today and tonight. We pray that you will lead us as we sleep and we dream. May you greet us in the morning, in a new day. - Amen. - Amen. There you go. - Love you, Dad. - I love you too. You can leave it open. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. What the fuck are you doing? I beg your pardon? She doesn't like you doing that. Good morning, Daddy. Good morning, son. Hey, why don't you run inside and fix yourself some cereal? We need to talk. Is this about Ashley? I didn't expect to see you here so early, Reverend. I need to tell you something about the day Ashley was born. Okay. We cast thee out, every unclean spirit... every devilish power, every legion. Reverend, morning. I didn't expect to see you. Oh, hello, Karen, I just, uh, stopped by for a minute, sorry to intrude. Uh, just come by the office today and we'll finish our conversation. Okay, I got to run, I just, uh, I'll let myself out. What's that about? Why did you say she doesn't want me to do that? And who is she? Hey. Where are you off to so early? I'm about to make some breakfast, are you hungry? Oh, no, thanks, I'm actually about to head out to meet up with an old friend. Um... But, yeah, I'll catch you later. Okay. Xander, honey, go ahead and get ready for school. Come on, son, put them pens away, got to go to school. I'm gonna run into town, and I'll swing him by school on the way. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, Reverend, he asked me to stop by his office. He was just here, why would he need you to go back? Yeah, he, uh... He said that he may have a job opportunity for me. Well, that's great. - Yeah. - I'll be praying for you. I'm gonna, uh, run a few errands first. I'm gonna drop his phone off, get that screen looked at. Okay. Come on, son, I'll meet you in the truck. Ashley? Good morning. Morning. May I help you with something? No, just looking around. Do you happen to know where the Lakeside Market is? It's right across the street, take a right, two doors down. Thank you. - Here's your food. - Thanks. Enjoy. Hey, Nat. Oh, my god, hey. Oh, it's so good to see you, how are you? - Oh, my god. - I've been better. Please, sit down, can I get you anything, coffee? - Uh... - An espresso, please. Yes, give me, like, two seconds. Thanks. It's on the house. Um, give me literally, like, two minutes, I'm gonna go and take a break, okay? Okay. Hey. - Is that her? - Yeah, that's her, but, please... - Right there? - Yes, please be nice, just chill, okay? Hey, um, I'm Tyler, I'm Nat's brother. You're Jordan, Ashley's sister, right? Do you know her? Well, not exactly, but did you hear what happened to her? No, all I know is her and my aunt went off with some Dr. Carraz, and I don't really know who he is. Well, yeah, that and what happened to her in Mrs. Ziggler's class. - What happened? - Listen, apparently she fell asleep in class, and then, when she woke up, she just started screaming in horror, and it scared the shit out of the whole class, - and the teacher too. - Yeah, she also bit off Shane Stevens' dick. - Ew. - No, it wasn't his dick. She bit off Shane Stevens' tongue. She just went crazy and totally lost her shit. - She freaked out a few times. - That girl, she was tripping. Dude, get your ass out of here before you're late to school again and Mom kills us both. Please, go, now! Let's get out, go! - Sorry. - Hey, um... - What? - Can I get your number? Get out of here, Romeo, bye! I'm on break, shall we take a walk? - Let's do it. - Okay. - Dude, I'm just glad that you're back home. - Yeah? - I missed you. - And I missed you too. Oh, thanks. Do you remember when we were seniors and... they put all the cows and chickens in the, uh... - Yeah, in the lobby. - In the senior... Yeah. The entryway, whatever it was. It was so ridiculous. - Like, the most random idea. - There was poop everywhere. Dude, what reminds me of that is when my brother got a spray paint can, and he, like, covered up all the labels of the parking spaces, and no one knew where to park, they were so mad. He's so funny. I know. He's something else. Yeah. I just... I don't know. This is Tanya's. She's never closed it more than a day. Yeah. I need to tell you something, can we sit down? Yeah, of course. Listen... I don't know if all the other stories are true, but I need to tell you this. My mom was at church, and Ashley was there, and she had a breakdown in front of everyone. My mom even said she was bleeding from her eyes. - I don't know. - Wait, was Reverend Michael there? Yeah, of course. - I... - I just saw him yesterday, and he didn't say anything about it. Well, that's a small fucking town for you. Dude, there's secrets everywhere, but everyone still knows your shit. You know Hannah passed away, right? Hannah? I don't know her. She was younger than us, but your sister and her used to hang out a lot. So what happened? She was hit by a drunk driver, the driver died too. God. That's really messed up. Dude, what's fucked up is that Hannah and Ashley were hanging out right before she died. I heard that they wanted to do a seance or something. Why would they want to do that? I heard that she wanted to reach out to your mom. Look, Hannah was always into ghost-hunting shit, I just think that they wanted to see if it would work. Like, with a Ouija board? No, it was, like, some fucking old-school way, where you, like, put, like, a candle, put a candle on top of a Bible, and then you do a seance in front of a mirror, and you start calling out to the dead. I don't know. Something's not right, I need to get to the police. Call out a report, just... I'm sorry, I have to get back to work though, but please, let me know, text me, just if you need anything. Thank you. It was so good to see you. You too. All right, bye. Bye. I need to file a missing person's report. It's actually for two people. Can you give me the names? Yes, my sister, Ashley, she went missing a few days ago with my aunt, Tanya Winbourne. Tanya Winbourne, I know your aunt, she runs the art store across the street. They're not missing. Your sister got sick, and your aunt decided to take her out of town for a bit with the doctor. Why do the people in this town think that's normal? She was mentally unstable, honey. Now we all saw her have a panic attack in the church, and the doctor went to help her. Reverend Michael told us Tanya was so embarrassed that she and Dr. Carraz decided to take Ashley out of town for a bit. My sister would not leave town without telling me first! Have you done any investigating of this at all? - Have you talked to the reverend? - The reverend? Yes, have you looked under the church? Now why would we check under the church? Look, you need to just go home and wait for your sister and your aunt to give you a call when they're ready to. Flowery Ranch Police Station, please hold. Look, write your name and number down, and if anything comes up on our end, we will give you a call. Thank you for holding. Hey, Monge. How's Troy? Yeah. I can't keep this up much longer, things are getting way out of hand, I'm spiraling out of control here. I can't do this anymore. The Bible says God can restore what is broken and change it into something amazing. He's working through you right now, you have to remain strong. Stay strong? Tanya Winbourne is in catatonic shock. Two people are dead already, and I'm gonna be in prison if you don't get me help! Reverend Michael, you're gonna have to keep it together a few more days. Help is on the way, and we will take care of everything. But you need to stay calm. Someone will be in touch. Stay calm. This is crucified... dead and bury it. We need to send it into hell. "On the third day, he rose from the dead and he sent it into heaven, as if from the right hand of God, the Father almighty." "And hence he shall come to judge the quick, the dead." Judge. Come in. The ladies from the Red Hat Club aren't buying Pastor John's story. What do you want me to do with it? Stick to your story, I'll talk to them. - You okay? - Yes, fine, thank you. Okay, Mark's here to see you. Send him in. Mark. Mark, how are you? Here, have a seat here. Can I get you a drink or anything? Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot, please forgive me. Yeah. No, I haven't had a drink since I found out that Karen was pregnant with Xander. Of course. So, uh, is it nice having Jordan home now? Yeah. Yeah, it's been great. Although she blames me for everything that happened to her mother. I can see that in her eyes. We're working through it. I just want to be a better father to my children. I'm grateful for any opportunity that I have to be supportive to Jordan. I just hope I'm not too late to be the same for Ash. It's never too late. Mark, what I'm about to tell you is gonna be very difficult to understand... but you deserve the truth. Yeah. Ashley... has had the same demon that possessed Sarah. It's taken control of her. You mean, like, personal demons, like mental issues? Listen to me, listen to me, I have been doing God's work for over... 40 years, and I've tried my best, but I don't know, I don't know if I can do this anymore. Do what? Preach? We cast thee out, every unclean spirit... every devilish power, every legion. In the name and power of Jesus Christ, God the Father commands you, the Holy Spirit commands you, the son of God commands you, in the name of Jesus Christ, I cast you out! I'm sorry, Reverend, I'm having a hard time keep... Sarah! Sarah and Ashley are possessed by the Devil himself, and I should've let Sarah die that day. You're drunk. You're drunk, and I saw her going in the ground. I was there! I tried to do my best. I tried to do God's will, but I don't know anymore. I have done and seen things that no human should ever have to endure. Done? You're out of your fucking mind! - Is everything okay? - It's all right, it's all right, Geoff. You tell me where they are! What happened to my daughter?! I swear to God, you tell me, goddammit! If you know where they are, I find out that you're keeping anything from me, I will fucking kill you! - I don't know. - I swear to God, I will fucking kill you! Mark... Jordan is next. Fuck this. Shit. Shit, you scared me. What are you doing up? Are you... Are you all right? All right? I haven't been all right in 17 goddamn years. I thought you quit drinking? If you recall, Ashley and I were taken away from you because you were driving us around drunk. How much longer till you'll be driving Xander around drunk? Hmm? I just needed a drink, that's all. There's a lot of shit going on that you don't know nothing about. You think there's a lot going on around here that I don't know about? You should've heard the way they were talking about Ashley today around town. Some of the things that I heard about her, they're talking about her the way that they talked about Mom. I've heard those people talk. So you're just getting drunk? That's why Mom never married you. You think it was easy for me? Hmm? Losing the mother of my two children? I wasn't ever a good parent to you because I didn't know how to do it alone. You didn't know how to be anything but a drunk. I tried. I tried, goddammit! You know what, I knew this was a mistake. I shouldn't have come here. Don't worry, I'll leave in the morning. I fucked it up, Jordan. It'll be okay in the morning. It'll be all right in the morning. Yeah, it will. Come on. It'll be all right in the morning. Mom! Hey, Xander. You want to stay in here with me tonight? Xander? There's someone under my bed. I don't know, Xander, I don't see anything. It was right there. Can I just sleep with you tonight? I don't know, Xander. Actually, okay, why don't you stay in my room tonight? It's okay. Sarah? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I haven't been there for our children. The drinking. I've sinned. Hey. I just want to tell you how proud I am of you. I feel like this is a new start for all of us. A new beginning. This is your chance to be the kind of father you've always wanted to be to the girls. The kind of father you are to Xander. Love you. Mark? Can you hear me? Are you sleeping? Honey, what's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? Xander, get up! Come on, we've got to go! - What's going on? - Come on, just come with me, please. What's happening?! Close the door, close that door. Come on. We don't have time right now, we don't have time. I just need to get you out of here, okay? Look at me. I need you to be brave. I'm gonna lower you down to the ground, okay? - Okay. - And when you get there, I need you to run... - I'm scared. - ...and call 9-1-1. What's going on? It's gonna be okay, you just have to get to safety. Okay. All right, look, Xander, I know this is scary, but you can do this. I'm gonna be right behind you, okay? Go! Go. Go! Run! Xander? Xander? Xander? Xander? Xander? Answer me! No! Dad, no! No! Please, Dad, no! Please! It's me, please, Dad, no! It's me. Please, Dad, no! Please, please. Please. Go, Xander. Go. Go. Come on. Here. Okay, Xander, you have to get in here, okay? - Okay. Okay. - And hide. I am going upstairs to call the police. I'm coming right back. - Okay. - Do not leave. Do not leave here, I will be right back. Shit. 9-1-1, what is your emergency? It's my father, he's trying to kill us. Oh, okay, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to speak up, I can barely hear you. It sounded like you said someone's trying to kill you? Who's trying to kill you? He's coming, please, I don't have much time. - It's my father. - Well, hold on, ma'am, I'm trying to understand you. My father, he killed his fucking wife, there's blood everywhere. Okay, stay on the line with me. What is your exact location? I don't know, I'm in the middle of nowhere. It's the old farmhouse on Old Creek Mill Road. Please hurry. He's here. He's coming. My god, he's coming! Okay, stay on the line with me. Shit. Xander! Xander. Thank God. Okay. Come here. Come on, we got to get out of here. Yeah. Come on. Go, go, run! - Run. - Are you okay? Oh, god. Come on, Xander. Is my mom okay? Listen... I'm not going anywhere, okay? I'm right here, I'm staying with you, okay? Okay. - Help! - Come on, Xander. - Help us! - Help us! - Come on, Xander! - Help us, please! - Please, help us! - Come on. - He's in the back of the car! - Here, you'll be safe. - He's in the back of the car! - Climb in. Come in! - Xander, get in. - You'll be safe. You'll be safe in here. Stay there. We were en route to the house and found the kids, now we're in pursuit of the father. 10-4. Trunk's empty. Officer down, I need backup, officer down, I need backup! I repeat, officer... No! Dad, stop! - No! - Dad, please! - No! - Dad! - No! - Dad, please, stop! - Stop. - No! No. Oh, god! - Please stop. - Please. No! Please don't do this. Please don't do this, Daddy. Daddy, please. Please, don't this, Dad, it's me! - Help! - Please don't do this! Please don't do this, Dad! Dad, please, it's me. Dad! Help! I can't, I can't, I can't. No! Dad, I can't, please, no. No, I can't! No! Chief, Chief, we have two officers down. We have a 1033 in progress and a possible 1015. - Chief Lane. - What exactly is going on? Houston's out back digging up a grave that we found. - A grave? - Yeah. - Who's in it? - We don't know yet. Deputy Callahan's inside talking to Reverend Michael now. And how's he holding up? Well, he's had quite a bit to drink, ma'am. - Just go get him out. - All right. Chief, this is fucking crazy. We were digging into the dirt out back, and we found bodies. - Bodies? How many? - Two for now. I think it's Pastor John and Dr. Carraz. - Oh, my god. - I'm gonna keep digging. - I'll keep you posted, okay? - Yeah. Possessions is where the demons walk among us. It's making a huge mistake. You can't let them do this, you got to take her out. Ma'am, you're gonna want to take a look in the basement. We found these padded cells down there. Tanya Winbourne and I think her niece, Ashley, are both locked up in there. They're letting them out now, we're gonna need an ambulance. Stay back, stay back! Stay back, I need backup! Stay back, stay back! You're gonna rot in jail, you son of a bitch. Our Father, Lord in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
