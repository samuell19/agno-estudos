Oh, I'm sorry, I don't seem to have access to those files. You see, our system was hacked last week by a very sophisticated internet crime ring. The whole thing is under investigation.

I'm gonna find and save our boy. My love. I promise. Good to see ya, Joe. Good to see you, too, Frank, it's been too long. Listen, I need to talk to you about Adam. What're you talkin' about? You remember that case you were asking me about? It was part of a ring of underground clubs where people kept disappearing. And we kept gettin' nowhere because the feds were breathing down our backs as soon as we had a solid lead. Yeah, yeah, that's right. You won't believe this, but we think that the same guy who was running these place 20 years ago is back. Are you serious? It gets worse, Joe. We've got pictures of Adam at the scene with some of these guys. We have had guys deep cover on this for months. Can't be Adam. I've got a file two-inches-thick that I managed to pull. So, if you want me to help you find Adam, we gotta do it now. - Can you meet me in two hours? - Yes, of course. - We've gotta find Adam. - We will. Just sit tight and wait for me. Oh, by the way. I translated those words you sent. I couldn't make head or tails of it. It don't make much sense to me, it just keeps repeating awake or rise up or something. The strange thing is, it's the same word, but in three different languages. Joe. Joe, you gonna be there? Yeah, Frank, I'll be there. Listen, I owe you. You'd do the same thing for me, brother. Two hours. Joseph? Father Callaghan. I didn't know you were still in this church. Well, how would you know, you never enter the premises. Touche. Joseph, it's good to see you. It's good to see you, too, Father, it's been a long time. - I miss our talks. - As do I. How have you been, how is Adam? I guess there's no point of lying to a priest. It's not good. To be perfectly honest I don't think I'll ever get him back. Oh, Joseph, you're his father, he needs you. He's lost his way, he won't even listen to me. I fear for his soul. What? You know, ever since Katherine, you know. He blames everyone around him, he even blames God. He must be in terrible pain to be considering those thoughts. I'm so sorry, Joseph, I know it must be hard on you. Well, I can accept him being angry with me and somehow blaming me for everything, but to turn on his faith, the one sacred thing that we both taught him to hold onto. Father, I just don't know. Joseph, a man's faith is tested many times in his life. Believe me, I know, it comes with the territory. The question is, do we accept the lies that are sometimes whispered in our ears? Or, do we go deep inside our hearts and listen to the stillness, the inner-gifts that God provides us? You know God is always knocking, Joseph. There's a lot I haven't shared with you. Do not believe the evil one's ways. Do not believe what you see or hear, look inside. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, protect Joseph and his lost child, Adam, from the dark forces that abound. Be their rear guard as they embark into the valley of darkness. For greater is he that is within, than he that is in the world. Satan, you and your minions do not have authority over our lives, for we belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. Amen. - Take care, Joseph. - Thank you, Father. We'll see. Oh, gentlest heart of Jesus. Ever present in the blessed sacrament. Ever consumed with burning love for the poor, captured souls in purgatory, have mercy on them. Be gentle in your judgements, and let some drops of your precious blood fall upon the devouring flames. Oh, merciful savior, send your angels to conduct them to someplace with refreshment, light and peace. Amen. You know, I can still hear you praying in your mind. Ya little leech. I remember when you were a little boy, praying and praying. Spouting Biblical nonsense night after night, hoping that someone was listening. Do you know who was listening, Father? I... Was listening. When you woke up in the middle of the night, and you felt the chill go up and down your spine, and your hair stood up on your arms, and you heard that ringing in your ears. That was me. Listening. Father. I'm sorry. Did I interrupt you? Please. Continue. You were saying something about Biblical nonsense. Go on. No? Oh, Lucifer. Let's not pretend that you're an angel within God's grace, when we all know that you live in the shadows. Tell the father how the high-frequency sound one hears is in fact the presence of light and protection within the darkness you create. For where there is darkness, there is also light. Shh. Do you not remember the truth, my brother? I never understood why he liked you best. You with your self-righteous know-it-all attitude. You never let me have any fun! I wanna have fun with these neanderthal boneheads. Look at him, a priest, a priest dressed in cloth. Like a little girl. I want him! I want him and the guy buried outside! Judge not and you shall not be judged. Condemn not and you shall not be condemned. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged. And with the same measure you use, it will be measured back to you! You hypocrite! You hypocrite! First take the plank out of your eye and you can clearly see to remove the speck from your brother's eye, bla, bla, bla. Where have you been for the last 1,983 years? Don't you know I've already been judged, by the puppet master you call God! What do you care about these parasites anyway? Lest you forget, my cast-down brother, that you only have dominion over the recipients of the number of the beast. And can only take those containing the mark of the beast who worship your image. The priest has repented and is absolved of his sins, and is once again, unlike you, in God's grace. But it isn't too late for you, Lucifer. Ask him for forgiveness. I am not your brother. How dare you talk to me that way. This war isn't over. I may have lost the battle, but my book has yet to be written! I'll be back. I'll take what's mine. This is Mills, leave a message. The mailbox is full. Thanks for the drink. My name is Joe. Nice to meet you. I'm Catherine. Catherine? Oh, it's such a beautiful name. I'd listen to her, if I were you. You're weak, Joseph. You've always been weak. You pretend to be a man of God. Who are you kidding? Do you know why God took your wife away? Because you couldn't protect her because you're weak. You've always been weak. Your son is weak. Like father... Like son. No! I pray for the innocent who have died for nothing, and have succumbed to the seven deadly sins of man. Wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and gluttony. Let it all burn to the ground! No, no. Now to you, Joseph Gable. You self-righteous failure of a human being. You had a choice. Your wife and son counted on you and you failed. You failed as husband, you failed as a father. You have no one to blame but yourself. And I'm gonna end this right here, right now, tonight. Father, forgive me, I have failed. I do not deserve to go on any longer. Joseph. Joseph. Don't be afraid. God has sent me in your moment of need, to be your guiding light. Your son is lost, but your faith can change that, my brother. - How will this happen? - Not by might, nor by power. "But by my strength," says the Lord. He will help your son through Jesus Christ who strengthens you. Adam is very important to God. He's been blinded by Lucifer's darkness, but I assure you, Joseph, that tonight, he will be found by you. Because with God, all things are possible. I am the servant of the Lord. Let this happen to me as you say. The battle has begun. His eyes. - Why are his eyes... - Joseph, be still. We're entering the den of evil. You're gonna see things that you don't understand. But you don't have to be afraid. Not by your strength, but by God's might. Remember, Joseph, the eyes are the windows to our soul. This way, follow me. Stay close. Follow me. Adam's at the other end of the club. Go to the men's washroom, you'll be greeted.

Michael, you remember my name. I am surprised. But I am no longer the watcher for the one you call Lord. I convinced several other Gregory brothers and sisters to stay with me a long time ago. And now we have legions who join me. Have some fun for once. Hm? Oh, you're so serious, Michael. How about you, Adam and Joseph join together, have a talk? You seem to have forgotten that you were banished for your disobedience. You and the other Gregory have done enough. Begetting the felum, teaching the humans dark arts. Especially your brother, Azazel, who taught them the secrets of war, which brought down the wrath of God on them. I remember, the Book of Genesis. Well, well. If it isn't the. His swine servant, sinner Joseph. And my brother Sam. Let's make a deal. Shall we? Now, we get Joseph, and Adam. We've endured 70 generations of banishment. Now we're back. I think it's fair, don't you think? The Lord said unto you that you shall be led off to the abyss of fire and to the torment and the prison in which all of you shall be confined forever. And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will, from thenceforth, be bound together with you until the end of all generations. Welcome, boys! I am impressed. I must admit, I will miss Azazel and Samyaza. Tossing them into the depths of the desert for seven generations. It's a little harsh, don't you think? You need to control that temper of yours, Michael. Adam, what are you doing here? You're not one of them. This is my family now, Joe. See, you're a liar and I don't care about you. They understand me far more than you ever will. I'm finally free. My eyes have been opened. They're all here to deceive you from the truth. Don't you remember your mother, the love, the family, our bond to God and scripture? God is faithful who will allow you to be tempted beyond what you can handle. The same power that rose Jesus from the dead is at work in you, Adam. You can tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Dad. Silence! Enough with the ancient rhetoric. Joseph and Adam Gable, in case you have not noticed, belong to moi. Lest you forget, they are sinners, and I hold the key to their souls. By the time I'm through with you tonight, Michael, you will wish that you never came into my. That's where you're wrong, Lucifer. Lest you forget, no one belongs to you. God wants them to have a choice, and I'm here to make sure that they do. I didn't get an invitation. Nor did I. Looks like the real deal. What is this? A United Nations intervention? All this because of the Gable boys and Adam's little... Let's make an example of her. Shall we? And there was war in Heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought his angels. Do you remember, fallen one? Unto you, child, I say, come into the light. Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Don't stay here! What're you doing? Move, you idiots! They will suffer. As I have suffered. Adam, Katia, do you remember anything from the nightclub? Yeah, of course. You came in bursting with your cop buddy here, took me and Kat out, we were having a great time. Yeah, this is illegal, I'm calling the cops. You could tell 'em all about it, 'cause that's where we heading, the police station. They know not what they saw tonight. They're still under the influence of the evil one. I have faith in you, Joseph. We must allow free will to take place for Adam's transformation. Only the devil himself can enter where we're going. He has the power to manipulate and influence, but, he must not interfere with free will. Or he himself will cease to exist. I'm so sorry, Mom. Kat. Thank God you're alive.
