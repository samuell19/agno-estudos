I know my dad and I only lived with them for four years when I was little, but... Katherine and Anja were like the mother and sister I never had. Well, here is your copy. Thank you for letting me hold on to it. I'm sorry I don't have more. Just this one picture of them. I guess I wasn't really expecting anything. Not with so little to go on. Well, even for a... an experienced genealogist, it was a challenge. And Tina, it may be the only photo you have, but it's... it's a good one. A very good one. And because you were smart enough to keep it, we were able to use it to track down the woman whose wedding you attended when the photo was taken. It turns out she and Katherine have kept in touch all these years. Wait, are you saying that... - Are you ready for us, Sophie? - Mm-hmm. Did you... Tina? Katherine? Is that you? Anja. Well done, Soph. Soph! It's me! You said 9:00, and it's 9:30. 9:30? Come on,. Oh! - Hey, um, can we talk? - Yeah. Are you sure the leukemia is back? I mean, you've been in remission for so long. There's always a chance it was gonna come back. Soph, I know how to do this, okay? There's a few more tests to run, but I already have a treatment plan. Okay, okay. Um, so... Tell me, what's the first step? Well, step one is you put some liquor in that tea and we marathon The Golden Girls for five hours. - Hey, I'm serious! - So am I. All right, well, answers first, then hot toddies after. Okay, so, I will eventually need a bone marrow transplant. We just have to find a matching donor first. Mom and Dad got tested today, and Jackson's coming up tomorrow to get tested too. Stop eating my food and give me a hug. Come on. - I love you. - I love you too. Okay, okay, okay. One hot toddy, please. Fine, but... I am really happy for you that Jackson's coming back. It's just, it feels like ever since he moved to Manhattan, he just forgot we existed. Well, he did come back for your mom's funeral, at least. I know he did, but you know what I mean. Yeah, well, I mean, Manhattan is, like, a train ride away. You could just go visit him like I do. I have lots of family trees to shake and no one's gonna shake 'em but me. - Well, and Esme. - Right. - Have you told her yet? - Not yet. Okay. What about Alex? Oh, yeah, I was going to tell you, I swear, but we broke up, like, two weeks ago. What!? John, and you didn't tell me? Well, because it's no big deal! - I'm your be... - I'm fine. I mean, could you really imagine that conversation? Hey, Alex, I know we've been dating for two months, but surprise, my leukemia's back. I know, but I've told you this time and time again, you have to trust people. Soph, I am here right now 'cause I wanted to tell you what's going on, not dissect my love life. Okay? - Okay. - So... How about that Golden Girls marathon? How can I possibly say no to that? - Thank you! - Stop eating my food. Dr. Forest, dial 118, please. Dr. Forest, please dial 1-1-8. Soph? Jackson? Hey! - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here, hm? Well, I was getting tested to see if I could be a bone marrow donor for Jonathan. I mean, I know the chances of a non-related match are low, literally 1 in a million, but I thought it was worth a shot. And I'm just the first. Jonathan said I was okay to share the news, so Esme and a few others are coming by later. Actually, you're second. I just did mine in the other room there. Hey, Winston! Soph, Jackson. Hey man, it's been a while. I was about to head to your office when I ran into Sophie. Well, this seems a good trip. Hi. I'm up. I'll see you both later, I hope? Yeah. Ah, lot of people really care about Jonathan. Yeah. Yeah, he's really loved. Yeah. So, I read that siblings have, like, a 25 percent chance of being a match? I mean, not that I'm the expert. You're the doctor. ER doctor, not an oncologist. But yeah, Mom and I are the most likely. I have a 1 in 4 chance. Parental match is a longer shot, but significantly more likely than a random donor match. But between you and me, Mom's pretty much convinced herself it's gonna be me. What about George? I mean, I know he's not your bio dad, but... He thinks he'll be a match, although it's extremely unlikely. You know him, though... Soft belly, big heart. - You'll keep me in the loop? - Of course. Hey, we didn't, uh, get much of a chance to talk at your mom's funeral. I just, I wanted to say again how sorry I am. She was like a second mother to us growing up. I still can't believe she's gone. - Thanks, Jackson. - Yeah. - I should get back to work. - Yeah, okay. Um, this is my stop. - I'll see you around, Sophie. - Yeah. Dorothy? Hey, what are you doing here? I just came from the hospital. Hi, Sophie. Um... can we talk? Yeah. Is everything okay? - Let me buy you a coffee. - Okay. Jonathan told you about the relapse? I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you, but they're gonna find a match. That's why I wanted to talk to you. If Jackson and I aren't a donor match, the doctor has suggested that another member of the immediate family might be. And that's where you can help me. I'm not following. I wanna hire your company to find the boys' biological father, - Clark Higgins. - I... I thought he died before the boys were born. The State of New York declared him dead three years after his disappearance, but they never found a body. Just his car after it went off the bridge. Um... that's us the day we tied the knot. Behind us, you can see Clark's sister, Jessie, and his best friend, Bill. Nine years after the disappearance and a month before I got this postcard, my friend Anna swore she saw Clark in Boston. I hired a private investigator to try and find him, but no luck. Postmarked Bradford, Massachusetts. I think that's near Boston. Did Clark have any ties to the area? Not to my knowledge. What about any other family members besides his sister? Just Jessie. I think she got married and moved away, but I'm not sure. And the private investigator that you hired... Couldn't find a thing, but... I've seen how good you are, Sophie. And you know what my boys mean to me. I need your help. Please. I'll pay you whatever you ask. No, Dorothy, I can't take your money. Oh Sophie, you have to. I... Of course I will take the case, but I can't take your money. I mean, you guys are... You guys are family. Thank you. Uh, there's just one other little small thing. I haven't told the boys about any of this, so... you'll need to be discreet. Dorothy, I can't lie to my friends. I'm happy to take the case, but you have to be straight with Jonathan and Jackson. And besides, they deserve to know. Okay. Okay. I'll call them as soon as I leave here and tell them everything. - Then we're good. - Thank you, Sophie. I know if anyone can find Clark, it's you. Earth to Sophie! Hi. I got your favorite farro and beat salad from Le Chef. Ooh, sorry, my mind was on something else. We... we have a new case. Oh, you saw the email about the love letters client. I was gonna give her a call later about the job, but glad you got a head start on it. No, actually, we have a new case, one that hits kind of close to home. Dorothy just hired us to find Jonathan and Jackson's biological father to see if he is a bone marrow match. Uh, that's new to me. How do you match a dead guy? Well, it turns out maybe not so dead. Nine years after his disappearance, there was a sighting. And then there's this. - Whoa, he sent this? - Possibly. It's been handled too much for fingerprints. Uh, can you pull the death certificate for me? His name is Clark Edward Higgins. - Yeah. - Thanks. Death by drowning, and they never recovered the body, right? Right. I had Dorothy walk me through it. Clark's car went off the Buffalo Skyway sometime during the night. The reason the car went off the bridge is unknown and a body was never recovered. Okay, so... what's our next move? I'm gonna try to find Clark's best friend, Bill Reynolds. I need to get a DNA sample from Jonathan and enter it into the DNA databases. Maybe we can lock into a paternal match. There's also an aunt, uh, Clark's sister, Jessie. Okay, well, we can search for her the old-fashioned way... Social media, ancestry websites, et cetera. Assuming she's still using her maiden name. Right. So... I'm gonna be kind of slammed with this. How do you feel about taking on the love letter case by yourself? - You're serious? - Mm-hmm. - I got my own case? - Yeah, I think it's time. You've been working with me for, what? - Six months. - I think you're ready. Wow, from art teacher to genealogical detective. Oh, I'm ready. And I'm gonna go talk to the love letters lady right now. Great. You'll like it. Wait, you forgot your lunch! So, Alicia, why don't you tell me about how you found these letters? I wanted a fixer because I'm all about DIY. You renovated this place yourself? I started with the kitchen first because I knew it was gonna take the most work. But when I ripped out the floorboards here, I noticed one of these boards was loose. This was hidden under it. There are no last names or addresses. No envelopes. Just the letters. "My darling Charlie, "If only I could hold you, "feel the warmth of your arms around me. I know fate has kept us apart, but one day..." "we'll find our way back to each other." "With love, R." - So romantic, right? - Well, just so you know, these letters may be older than we realize. I can't guarantee that the people involved are still alive. If they are, I promise that we will do everything in our power to return them to their rightful owner. Thank you, Esme. ♪ When I set my eyes on you ♪ ♪ All the lights still bleeding ♪ ♪ When I set my love on you, oh ♪ ♪ Written across your face ♪ Hey! Sorry. - Sorry to interrupt. - It's okay. I could use a break. Want to come to the record store with me for some retail therapy? Ooh, yes, that sounds great. But first I just need a quick DNA sample from you. Excuse me? Why? Well, I need the sample so I can upload it to some online genetic databases. Look, I know those are words you're saying, but I'm completely in the dark here. Your mom didn't call you, did she? - She was supposed to tell you... - Tell me what? That you're coming over with a very large Q-Tip. I have no idea if she called. I've been listening to music the whole time. Um, your mom wanted me to do a job for her, but it's not a big deal and I can just come back - after you guys talk. - Sophie. What job? Hey, guys. I got chocolate glazed, coconut cream, sprinkled, old fashioned glazed... Oh, and cinnamon sugar. I wasn't sure what you'd like, but I thought a little sugar might be a little morale booster. What's with the gloves? Did I interrupt something? No, not that all. Sophie here was just collecting a DNA sample for Mom. But she won't tell me why. A DNA sample, huh? Why would you need that? Mm, your mom didn't call you either. No. Um... It's not a big deal. Uh, I'm just gonna come back later, after you guys talk to her, so... - Soph? - What? - You're doing the thing. - I didn't do the thing. Yeah, you're doing the thing. Any time you're not being straight with me, you do the thing. I can't. You can't what, Sophie? Tell us. Okay, um... Your Mom hired me to find your biological father. She thinks he might still be alive and that he might be a bone marrow match for Jonathan. And why are you just telling us now? We didn't have any proof. That's why I hired a private investigator all those years ago. I didn't wanna say something to you and be wrong. Your mother and I talked about it after her friend Anna thought she saw Clark in Boston, but... But what? You should've told us. It was our right to know. He was our father. I don't understand how you can just be standing there acting like this isn't a huge deal. It is a huge deal, but we need to focus on what matters right now. Jonathan, you're right. We made a mistake. And I am so sorry for not sharing this with you. Mom, we know this was hard for you, that you were just doing what you thought was right. - We do? - Look, I'm just trying to see things from her point of view. We were just trying to protect you both. - And this is how you protect us? - Yeah. By lying to us, and then hiring Sophie behind our backs to find the guy who dumped us and took off? Your biological dad could be a bone marrow match. - We have to at least try. - Jackson is gonna be the match. So I don't understand why we're having this conversation. Jonathan, please. Okay, say you find him. Let's say he's a match. How do you know he's gonna go through with it? He wasn't there for us growing up. So why would he be there for me now? It's worth a shot. I wanna do whatever it takes to keep you alive. Yeah, we all do. If you wanna waste your time looking for a man who abandoned us, abandoned Mom, go ahead. Even if he is alive, he has done a real good job of hiding himself our entire lives. Good luck finding him. Jonathan has a right to be upset with us. You know, if my parents hadn't told me I was adopted when I was seven and instead sprung it on me as an adult, I'd be hurt. How are you doing about it all? I don't know. It's kind of weird to think about Clark being alive out there somewhere. Living a whole other life. Maybe even having a whole other family. I think that's one of the reasons why I became a doctor. I get that. You couldn't help your dad, but you could help other people. Yep, pop psychology for the win. You know, for what it's worth, I've always admired the way you've followed your heart. You're doing what's important to you. You're helping people. And all the while living in one of the most amazing cities in the world. Well, you didn't have to stay back here in Buffalo. I-I couldn't leave my mom. And it was a joy to be there for here when she needed me. I wouldn't change it for the world. You know, we never talked about any of this stuff before. Mm, you never asked. Yeah, well, that's my bad. I should've. Ah, I didn't have lunch, and since we're standing in front of Big Tony's... I've got first dibs on pinball. Oh, you... Did you and Jonathan ever spend time with your aunt Jessie? I don't think we ever met her. I was just wondering if maybe Clark reached out to her, if maybe she knows where he is. Assuming he did fake his own death, he would need some help, right? I just wanna know why he did it. Why fake his own death? No money, no job, no place to live. What's he running away from? Finding out the answer to that could mean a lot. We should talk to Anna ourselves. - We? - She knows me. Maybe I'll be able to get her to open up, talk more openly. Oh, I like this. Jackson Ford is my Watson extraordinaire. Ah, ah, ah, it's Dr. Watson Extraordinaire. Right. Hi! Anna Malone? Yes. Can I help you? - Hi, Anna. - Oh, Jackson. This is my friend, Sophie McClaren. She's Harry's daughter. We were hoping to ask you about something. Sure, come in. So what did you wanna talk about? Clark Higgins, my biological father. My mother said that you thought you saw him in Boston. If she already told you... It's really better to get the information from the source. That's a long time ago. I don't really remember much. Can you tell us what you do remember? I'm not even sure it was him. Like I said, it was a long time ago. And even back then, I almost didn't tell your mom, because if I was wrong, then it would only hurt her. But something compelled you to tell her. What was it? I just thought if it were me, I'd wanna know. I was in Boston for my niece's wedding, at the rehearsal dinner. I just remember looking out the window of the restaurant, and there he was, walking by. So I ran outside, called his name. No response. Watched him hop into a car and leave. I know this was a really long time ago, but is there anything else you can remember? Maybe the car? Wait a minute, The car. Uh, it was one of those boxy Volvos. It was gray or... blue. Powder blue. Okay, a powder blue Volvo. That's something. Is there anything else you can remember? I... No, no. Anna, if you saw something, we really need to know. Please. Jonathan has had a relapse and he needs a bone marrow transplant. If I'm not a match, Clark might be. We need to find him just in case. There was a woman holding on to his arm. It was very intimate. I didn't see her face, but she had long red hair. I felt terrible for Dorothy. If it was Clark, then he wasn't dead. He left her for another woman. I'm so sorry, Jackson. Yeah, well, it's better than no truth. Well, at least now we really do have reason to believe that Clark was alive back then, and that maybe he had a powder blue Volvo. Doesn't seem like much to go on. I mean, I guess we know he had bad taste in cars. Hey, believe me, I have found people using far less. Look, I wanna help, so what can I do? Actually, there is one thing. But I promised my dad I'd have dinner with him tonight, so if you don't mind... I'd be happy to swing by Harry's house. Okay. All right, that's it! That wasn't so bad, was it? Thank you. I just didn't wanna bother Jonathan with this, you know? Mm-hmm. Now what? Now I send your genetic profile into online ancestry databases, see if we get any matches. Maybe Clark had other kids or distant relatives who may know his whereabouts. And in the meantime? In the meantime, I use other tools at my disposal and focus on the Boston area. Do you really think you can find him? If he's alive, I think I can find him. I just hope I can do in time. I'm also on the hunt for Clark's best friend, Bill Reynolds. Your mom said he was a witness at their wedding. He and Clark taught at the same school, but your mom and him lost touch. - Hey, hey! - Hey, Dad! - Look who came to say hi. - Harry! Good to see you. Jackson, my favorite Ford kid. Dad! You know what? Don't listen to anything this man says because he tells Jonathan the same thing every time he comes over. Don't give your old man's secret away, kiddo. Harry, you? Old? No way. Hm? You see why he's my favorite? Yeah. Sophie told me what was going on. I'm glad you're here. Jonathan and your parents need all the support they can get right now. - I'll do my best, sir. - I know. Stay for dinner, hm? I'm making chicken a la Harry. There's more than enough for three. Oof, as good as that sounds, I better get back to my parents' house. Jonathan's coming by for dinner tonight, and I was told to be home at 7:00 sharp. - I'll walk you out. - Well, maybe next time. Just you and me, kiddo. Don't be a stranger, huh? - Good to see you again, Harry. - Same to you. Thanks for letting me tag along today. - Yeah. - I need to be doing something or I'm gonna go stir crazy. Yeah, same old Jackson, can't abide boredom. Don't know too many guys who were football captain and salutatorian of their class. And that would've been valedictorian if there wasn't some brainiac girl who remembered everything in my class. Oops. Okay, um, so I'll call you tomorrow and we'll make a plan? - Great. - Okay. - Good night. - Night. - Mmmm! - Mm-hmm! - That smells good, Dad. - Mm-hmm. What? Oh, nothin'. Dad, Jackson's just a friend. Sometimes friends can become more than friends, huh? Your mother and I were friends once upon a time. Okay, okay, I'm not 15 anymore. No dating advice. Hey, I wanted to ask you something, though, Dad. Um... you and Mom were friends with Dorothy when she was married to Clark Higgins, right? Well, your mother and Dorothy were friends. I mean, uh, we, uh... We double dated a couple of times, caught a ball game or two, but that's it. Why? Well, we have reason to believe that Clark may still be alive. - Wow. - Yeah. - All this time? - Yeah. It seems Dorothy knew about it, but Jackson and Jonathan didn't know. Well, now that you mention it... What? Do you know something about Clark's disappearance? George and I took in a Bills game once. I think you and the kids were maybe 9 or 10. And I remember he was really stressed and nervous. Not George-like at all. What was he nervous about? When I asked him, he said that there was something that was gonna make Dorothy leave him. No, not something. Someone. I offered to help, and he said he'd taken care of it. I guess he did, because he never spoke about it again. - Are you sure about when? - Definitely. '96 playoffs. Why? That was right after Clark was seen in Boston. Hi George, it's Sophie. I've left you a few messages. Um, if you could call me back, it's very important. Thanks. Just had a great meeting with the love letters client, Alicia. - Great. - So I already started working on chain of ownership for the house, but I learned it was built in 1954, and the kitchen where Alicia originally discovered the letters was an addition, so it wasn't built until 1981. Great work! That should narrow it down some. I'm excited! So how goes the hunt for Jonathan and Jackson's dad? - Well... - No. Whatever this is, I want no part of it. Well, you don't even know what I'm gonna ask you. I don't need to. I can see from the look on your face I'm not gonna like it. How about this? Dinner on me at the new French restaurant downtown if you'll swing by the hospital and ask Winston to put a rush on the DNA profile? I knew it. Sophie, he's so cute, but he can't even look me in the eye. It is beyond awkward. Like, he takes it to a whole new level, I... Can we just do it through the proper channels? No, because it will take weeks, and if you ask Winston, I'm pretty sure we'll get the raw DNA profile in days. This is a much bigger ask than steak frites and chocolate mousse. Oh, did I mention a bottle of their best wine to share? Huh? Plus, you'd be doing it for Jonathan. Okay, well, that's not fair because now I can't say no. I know. I might as well get it done now. But you do know that Winston is never gonna ask me out, right? No matter how many times you try to throw us together, it's just, it's hopeless. Who, me? Never say never! Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm trying to reach Bill Reynolds. He owns aircraft N-N-7-4-1-P. And he just won our drawing for a year's supply of, uh, airplane polish. I know, you never think people actually win those things, right? Yes, yes, a phone number would be great. Hi, is this Bill Reynolds? Yes, my name is Sophie McClaren. I'm a forensic genealogist, and I'm looking for Clark Higgins. Uh, I understand that, but I would actually still love to talk to you. It's very import... Esme. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure? - Well... - Wait, don't tell me. Let me guess. Is that a sample you'd like me to genotype for you? If you have the time and it's not too much trouble. I'll put a rush on it. That's great. Thank you, Winston. Well, I guess I should get going. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you're very beautiful. Busy. Busy. Beautifully busy. You are beautiful. Yeah. All right, well, uh, I just, um... I guess give the office a call when it's done. Yeah, uh... Thank you. Uh, no, thank you. No, thank you. Bye, Winston. No, thank you? Come on, Winston, use your words. I know I said I'd call, but I was in the neighborhood. Actually, I was gonna call you. I found Clark's friend, Bill Reynolds, and I was gonna head to the airfield now. Sounds great. I'll drive. Thanks. So chivalrous. If the guys you're dating aren't opening doors for you, you're dating the wrong guys. I'll take that under advisement. So, are you dating anyone? It's been a while since we've talked. Ah, you sound like Esme and my dad. How so? Well, Esme says I'm too picky. But I'm sorry, a guy wearing squared-toed dress shoes? That is a deal-breaker to me. Good to know that women don't like men in square-toed dress shoes. I'm mentally going through my closet right now. I think I'm good. And my dad, he just wants me happy, but that means finding somebody I actually like. And since dating now consists of swiping left and right, finding a good match seems impossible. How about you? I guess everyone just swipes left when they get to me. Stop. No, I've had a few serious relationships. But no one's ever lived up to my first love. She set the bar pretty high. Okay, well, whoever she is, I'm sure she's ruing the day she let you get away. Yeah, I don't think she is. Okay, so we're looking for Bill Reynolds in a gold-striped Cessna. Hello? Anyone here? N-N-7-2-4-1-P. Mr. Reynolds? Look, you can't be in here. There's a lot of sensitive equipment. - Mr. Reynolds? - Yeah. Uh, we were just looking for... Wait, you're the girl on the phone asking about Clark. Yeah, did you know him? I told you... Oh my goodness. You look just like your father. - Uh, I wouldn't know. - Of course not. He died before you were born. Look, Mr. Reynolds, I know you said you didn't wanna talk to me... So you thought you'd come down here and maybe I'd just change my mind. Yes, I was hoping. I just thought if we could explain the situation... I already told you on the phone, I'm not interested in dredging up the past. Now, I have work to do. Look, my brother's life is on the line, and I think my father would've wanted you to help us. Please? For your best friend? Like I said, I have work to do, so... if you wanna talk, you gotta work. We have reason to believe that Clark may still be alive. That he may have possibly faked his own death. I don't believe that for a second. Bill, you knew him best. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about him? Clark was a good guy. Always had your back. A champion dart player. Legendary at the Iron Hound, our local pub. He loved your mother, he... He never would've done something like faking his own death. Even if he'd gotten involved with another woman? Didn't happen. Clark was a responsible type. There's no way he woulda left her in a lurch like that. No, not unless... he had a very good reason. Was there a reason? He was upset that night, sure. But not enough to do what you're saying. Why was he upset? Clark called me that night. Asked me to meet him at the Iron Hound Pub. It was raining, it was a real mess out, but... Clark sounded bad, so I went. And he and your mom had had a fight. It was bad. - Was the marriage in trouble? - I don't know. They were newlyweds. They had plans, and getting unexpectedly pregnant with twins? That wasn't one of them, so... it freaked Clark out. Well, lots of people get nervous about having kids. You need to understand. Your grandparents? They were alcoholics. Not nice ones. After they passed, Clark was left with his younger sister, Jessie, to raise by himself, and she had emotional problems. She was in and out of school with trouble all the time. Clark did his best, but I think he felt like he really failed her. And now here he is, two babies on the way, two kids he was afraid he might fail. So you think if he ran, maybe that was why? If he ran? Yeah, could be. - Thank you very much. - Hi, George! Sophie, uh, what are you doing here? Well, I left you a few messages, but I know how busy you get, so I thought I'd just swing by your office. Yeah, I've been really busy. In fact, I have a meeting right now. So, sorry. Okay, well, this will just take a second. How about I do the talking and you tell me if I'm close? I think that Clark came back maybe a year or two after you and Dorothy got married, and I think that instead of finding Dorothy and the kids, he found you. And I think you know that he's been alive this entire time. Sophie! I have nothing to do with Clark. Do you understand me? Okay, listen, if he's out there, I'm sure you will do your best to find him. But I can't help you. Esme, what's up? I may have a lead on Clark's sister. I found the guy she was married to. How? Marriage records? Divorce records. I'm sending you his address now. Great. Look at the two of you. Boy, did I have my hands full. Yeah. Um, Sophie and I, we, uh... We talked to Bill Reynolds today. - You found Bill? - Mm-hmm. You know, I always felt bad about losing touch with him. Between you and me, I think he blamed himself for Clark's death, sending him out driving into the middle of a rainstorm, which is absurd. If anyone's to blame... it's me. Why? Because of the fight you two had? - He told you about that? - He did, yeah. The night that, uh, he died, I was angry. We... had a big fight, and I said some harsh words. I even threatened to leave him if he didn't get his act together, - but I didn't mean it. - It's not your fault. I pushed him over the edge. You didn't do anything wrong, Mom. Hi! My name is Sophie McClaren, and I'm looking for your ex-wife, Jessie? You mean the woman that left me six months into our marriage - for some old boyfriend? - Uh... I don't know where she is. I don't wanna know. You feelin' all right? You're looking a little flushed. And I have never known you to leave a slice behind before. Is this my doctor or my brother asking? I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. And Jackson, never comment on a gay man's eating habits. All right, that's fair. This is nice though, isn't it? Like I said, I-I feel like I haven't even since you since I've come home. Yeah, this... This whole Clark thing has been really upsetting. Dad lied to us, and then you didn't even have my back. That's not fair. I think if we sit down with Mom and talk... I'm not interested in hearing her excuses. - Can we just let it go? - Yeah, fine. Esme. Hey. Oh, fancy seeing you two here. We were just starving, so we thought we'd grab a bite after work. - Why don't you join us? - What happened to just us? You can't refuse a sick man. Can you, Esme? Sophie, come on, sit. Help me, please. Yeah, sure. - Hey! - Hey. Hi! I ordered us a medium mushroom and cheese to share. So, how's the search for our dead dad coming along? I have some leads I'm working on, but nothing solid yet. Yeah, exactly. Esme, please, just tell me something exciting in your life. Well, I'm working on my first solo case. - Really? - Yeah. - That's great! - Thank you. And then hopefully she can help us find Clark after that, right? Absolutely. - You're helping too? - Yeah! Jonathan, it's... it's okay to have some help. Stop telling me how to feel, Sophie. Wow, okay, you need to break it down. You're not inside my head, Jackson. So please just stop acting like it. Sorry... - Jonathan? - Jonathan? I got you, I got you, I got you. Take it easy. Are you okay? Whoa, whoa, I need some water! Hey, hey, hey... Stay with me. Hey, look at me, buddy. That was so scary. - I'm glad you were there. - Yeah, me too. And I've had a few is there a doctor in the house moments, but it's an entirely different feeling when the patient is your own brother. Dr. Kravitz? You have a visitor in the main lobby. I really appreciate you being here. Hey, of course I'm here. He's my best friend. I mean, you are too, were. I don't know. I mean, we're still friends, right? I really missed having you in my life. Yeah, I mean, of course we are, Soph. I should've said this a long time ago, but I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken off the way I did. What do you mean? You know, taking the job in Manhattan when you and Jonathan were expecting me to stay in Buffalo after my residency? No, Jackson, it's not that I was upset with you for leaving. I mean, I was a little, yeah. But it's more that you took off right when things got bad with my mom. I mean, you just disappeared. I needed my friend, and you were just gone. Look, there's really no excuse, okay? If I promise I won't disappear on you again, you think you can forgive me? Yeah, of course I forgive you. I just want Jonathan to be okay. - I need him to be okay. - Yeah, me too. - Oh, hey. - Oh, hey. Uh... so the, uh, doctor said that Jonathan has a mild infection. It's nothing serious, but, uh, his immune system is weakened by the leukemia. But he's responding very well to the antibiotics, right? Right. And, um, they'll probably be sending him home soon. - Great. - So that's it. There's nothing else that we can do right now, so... I'll be taking your mother home. - I'll see you, Dad. - All right. - See you later. - See you, Mom. Bye, honey. Okay. Ah, hey, so, um... This is, um... I need to talk to you about something, and I don't want to upset you. Okay, you won't. What is it? I think that Clark came back to see your mom after she married George, and I think... I don't know. I think that George knows something that can help us find Clark. But he won't talk to me, so I was hoping... - Maybe he'd talk to me. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. And I promise you, I will be right by Jonathan's side when he wakes up. - Okay. - See you soon. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. I got your text. Your mother's resting. You know, this happened so long ago, I thought I was safe. I should've figured Sophie would be the one that figured it out. What happened? I'm not proud of what I did. I mean, Lord knows I always try to do the right thing and set a good example for you boys. But when someone threatens your way of life and your marriage... you really learn what you're capable of doing. - Dad? - Hm? Just tell me. You boys and your mother were at the McClarens. I was home alone, and Clark comes and knocks on the door like it was nothing. Like the world hadn't moved on since he disappeared. Why did he come back here? Did he say? Yeah, he wanted to apologize to your mother. Said that he had managed to escape from the car as it hit the water, but he had... suffered a skull facture. And then he wandered downstream for miles until he got picked up by a truck driver. He spent weeks in the hospital with his head injuries. - That's awful. - Yeah. And I was terrified. I was terrified that once she saw him, saw what he had become, that she'd break it off with me and go back to him. To help him. What do you mean? Why? The night of the accident, he lost his sight. And he never got it back. What? - Hi, cutie. - Hey. Did I make it to the door, at least? Or did I pass out in the middle of Tony's. Middle of Tony's. I am never gonna live that down, am I? - No. - No way. So? Any news? You're gonna have to wait for your oncologist for that. But if the love doctor's in, I might need some more of your advice. I already told you... The love doctor says that it's time to put on your big boy pants and ask the lady out. Love doctor, hm? Is this about Esme? Yes, sadly still pining away. Every time she comes around, I get tongued tied and I just choke. Winston, you gotta put yourself out there and damn the consequences. Even if it means a broken heart? Yeah. Even if. You don't want to regret not going for it when you had the chance. The love doctor concurs with the real doctor. Hey! You feelin' okay, Jonathan? Yeah. I could use a shower. And maybe a... an almond milk latte. You know, we can take care of the latte for you. Thank you. I have to get back to my lab. See you later? See you, Winston. - Sure you're okay? - Yeah. All right, love doctor. My dad was hiding something big. I don't know how you knew, but you were right. What did he say? Clark came to the house one night. He wanted to talk to my mom. Oh, and get this. The woman with the red hair, she was with him. My dad saw her sitting in the car. - Wow. - Yeah. My mom, she wasn't home, and I think my dad just freaked out, 'cause he threatened Clark. Yeah, he told him that he would expose him for faking his own death if he didn't leave right away. I think that could've landed Clark in big trouble. The worst part is, though, because of the accident, - Clark lost his sight. - Oh, that's awful. Yeah, I feel like my entire world just got flipped upside down, you know? Like, everything I ever believed is just wrong. It's gonna be okay. I promise. I hope so. Hey, as someone who was adopted, I've spent my entire life wrestling with that question. And it's always there, but it can be so hard to pull out that string. I'm still afraid to find my birth parents. My mom left me a package, and I haven't even opened it yet. It's a... it's a big leap to take. - Yeah. - Are you going to? I don't know. Maybe. I mean, like you said, everything feels upside down. Well, you'll know what to do, Soph. You always do. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Okay, so the results are in. Dr. Turner, what is it? Maybe I shouldn't be here. Sophie, stay, please. So neither Dorothy nor Jackson are a match. Obviously this is not the news we were hoping for. Now, we're gonna send Jonathan home with some antibiotics, but his infection has us concerned, so... We need to find Clark. Now. Winston came through! I just got his email, and I am uploading Jackson's DNA profile to all the registry sites. Ah, fingers crossed something comes through. - I think it's a good bet. - I don't know. I just feel like every lead I've taken lately has led to a dead end. Yeah, but you see things other people don't, Soph. You got this. - Hi. - Hi... Winston. I came here on the off chance that you were here. Yes. - Brought you donuts. - Oh! Thank you! Sophie says you love donuts. Sophie... Yes, I do love donuts. That's great. - That's awesome. - Yeah. May I have the honor of taking you out for a cup of coffee, Esme Sabatier? Are you asking me out on a date? - Yes. - Uh, then yes, yes, I would love to have coffee with you, Winston. Yes. Okay. Okay, all right, uh... I'll call you later. You've made me so happy. I'm so glad. Oh. So that just happened. I would hate to say I told you so, but... You told me so. Seriously, Jackson, you don't need to baby me. I'm fine. You gotta take it easy, okay? Your body needs rest, and I know you. You're gonna try to get up off this couch and head back into work. I just... I don't wanna think about being sick 24/7. I just wanna pretend that everything's gonna be okay for, like, five minutes. I hate to break it to you, but that's not how this works. Don't you think I know that? And when you keep pushing everyone away, like me, and Mom, and even Sophie, it's hard for me not to just step in and deal with everything for you, okay? That's the same problem we've always had, you being the older brother. By two minutes. Settle down. And you act like I'm incapable of looking after myself. Not true. Well, you went away and I did just fine without you. Yeah, well, I'm here now, okay? Yeah, and did someone's life have to be at stake for you to come back? Even you can't fix this for me, Jackson. So please, just... just back off. You got it. Take your meds. I found her. I... I found her. Soph? Soph? I found the missing link to my love letters case. Okay, so the house was used not just as a residence, but also a home-based business, mainly a hair salon called Carlotta's Curls and Cuts, Carlotta being the woman that owned the house in 1990. Now, I reached out to the former owner, and she said that Carlotta not only ran her business there, but also lived there. - And her nickname was Charlie. - Yes. So this whole time I thought we were looking for a man. It was Carlotta. So Carlotta just emailed me back. Turns out she lives right here in Elmwood Village. What do you think about going and returning these letters to her together? Let's go. So, you're looking for someone? Yes, and we think it might be you. Those are Robert's letters. They were found underneath the floorboards of your cousin's house. It's changed hands a few times since, but the current owner, a young woman name Alicia, wanted to make sure that they found their way back to you. I moved out after a few months, and when I realized I had left them behind, it was too late. You don't know what this means to me. Can I ask what happened with you and Robert? Robert was my first love. He wrote these to me on his first tour of duty in Iraq. We planned on getting married when he came home, and we did. Just so glad to have these back. Ah, part of him. Something I can share with Eddie and Gregory... his words. These memories are so important to have. Your family is so beautiful. Edgar is a junior at Baderton University, and Gregory is at a school for the blind right here in Buffalo. Wait up, Soph, what's... what's going on? - Where has my mind been? - What are you talking about? We have to get back to the office. I have been totally missing the obvious. Hi, my name is Sophie McClaren, and I'm looking for someone who I think... Hi, is there a Clark Higgins that ever taught at your school? Hi, has a Clark Higgins ever worked there? Clark Higgins. You're sure? He did. When? He retired? Okay, um, is there a forwarding address? No, okay. Thank you. Hi, Mom. I wish you were here. I feel like I've hit a brick wall. I just knew in my gut that Clark was a teacher and he would go back to teaching if he could, and that's how I'd find him. But I didn't. I was too late. And I'm running out of time, Mom. And this is the one case I can't fail. And I'm worried that's exactly what I'm doing. ♪ So you're trying to take away ♪ So once I finally found Charlie, aka Carlotta, - she was thrilled. - That's amazing. In my job, I don't usually get to deliver good news. I do hope they find Clark, though, for Jonathan's sake. If anyone can do it, it's Sophie and Jackson. Yeah, those two are relentless. - So Winston... - Hm? What was it that finally made you decide to ask me out? Uh... Something Jackson said. I realized if I didn't put aside my fear and ask you out, I was never going to get to know the real you. And that would've been the biggest regret of my life. Well, I'm really glad that you finally did. Waiting... a long time, you know? ♪ I fell into, into ♪ ♪ Your ♪ How long exactly? The day we met. ♪ How did you get me to fold ♪ ♪ So ♪ ♪ Soon ♪ Hey, what can I get ya? I'll take a lager, please. Thank you. Hey, so what brings you here? Nostalgia. You've been here before? No, um, my, um... My father has. All right, well, let me know if you need anything else, buddy. Yeah. Jessie, the red-haired woman. Food's about ready. Hey. Sorry, I'm not great company tonight. I just had a rough day. Soph, whatever problems you've faced in your life, you've always found a workaround. It's not the same this time. I... thought I had it. And I don't know. From the moment you came into our lives... your mother and I knew there was something special about you. And we were right. You're the best thing that ever happened to us. You're gonna find Clark Higgins. I have total faith. Thanks, Dad. I... I still haven't opened the package Mom left me. I want to. I just am not ready. Your mother would want you to take as much time as you need, honey. Opening the package she left you is not a race. Yeah. Sorry, Dad, um... it's Jackson. Um, Dad, will you check on dinner, okay? We just got a lead. Go get 'em, kiddo! Your mom gave me a black-and-white photo. That's why we couldn't tell that Jessie was the red-headed woman. And that was who Anna saw with Clark in Boston... Arm and arm because he's blind. That does make me feel a little better knowing he didn't just leave my mom for another woman. Wait, when I talked to Oscar, he said that Jessie had left him for an old boyfriend. And the way this guy, this K. Del Rio has his arm around her... You think that might be the old boyfriend? And if she got married and changed her name, that would explain why we haven't found her. Okay. Um... I'm running a search for Jessie Del Rio in the Massachusetts area, age range 50 to 60, with other family members in the same household and the same age range, specifically men, first initial K. Look, there, the bottom entry. Bradford, Mass. - Should we call? - Yeah, it beats a seven-hour drive. Hello? Hi, my name is Sophie McClaren, and I'm a forensic genealogist. I'm looking for someone who I think lived there. Jessie Del Rio? No, there's no Jessie here. Maybe you've got the wrong number. Is there anyone else that I can speak to? No, bye. Bust, huh? It was probably just a wrong number. We'll find her. It's only a matter of time. Time is the one thing we don't have much of. Maybe we should just head there tomorrow. You know, check out this address, the town nearby, see if anyone remembers seeing her? Yeah, yeah, you're right. We're not giving up. Okay, uh, I'll expand the search, see if we can get any more leads. And in the meantime, maybe we can order some takeout. I think that's your best idea yet. Yes. I think it's a good idea, we just having a little bit of food. I think someone was getting a little hangry. Excuse me! Who was the hangry one here? I think the last time we had Chinese food together was when we were 17 in New York City. Oh yeah, that's right. That little hole in the wall in the Village. That's the same night that you, me, and Jonathan, went to that Springsteen concert at the Garden, right? Yes, that was such a night! I remember I wanted to drive, but you wouldn't let me touch the wheel because you always had to be in control. Whoa, I just, I like to keep everyone safe. - That's why I became a doctor. - That's true. You know, um... that was the night I almost kissed you. - What? Really? - Yeah. What do you mean? Remember, um, Jonathan was asleep in the backseat, and we stopped at that gas station? - Yes, 'cause I wanted a soda. - That's right. Because Sophie wanted a soda, and I was trying to give Sophie whatever she wanted. So... what happened? Why didn't you kiss me? Uh... I don't know. We were... we were outside, leaning against the car. Looking at the stars... Well, I was looking at you. And I leaned towards you like this. And I was just about to ask you if I could kiss you. And then? And then, uh... And then, I don't know. I guess I just chickened out? Then Monday morning, Jeff Wizorski asked you out. Jeff Wizorski? Wait, that guy that asked me out to homecoming and then spent the entire night talking to his friends, ignoring me, and who I never went out with ever again? - That guy? - Yeah, that guy. Mm-hmm. So... Why didn't you try to kiss me again after that? I felt like I missed my chance. And then, um... I don't know. I decided that it wasn't worth ruining our friendship over one meaningless kiss. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I mean, thank god we preserved our friendship this long. Soph, I didn't mean it like that. It's okay. It's... no big deal. And we've been on different paths. You know, you in the city, me here. I guess we wouldn't have worked out anyway. Yeah. I guess not. But I'm glad you're back. I missed you. Yeah. Yeah, I missed you too, Soph. You and Jonathan are my closest friends. That's important to me. Yeah. Friends. Right. I have to say that you called it. Of course I did. Wait, what did I call? I can be a bit controlling. I push you to do what I think is best and I always have. Wow, um... that was not what I was expecting. And, um, I'm sorry. But you know I only do it because I love you, right? Yeah, and I love you too. I mean, I didn't mean to lay into you like that. But you know me. When I think it... - I say it. - You say it. Yes, I know. I gotta lay down. Yeah. Look, I-I feel like an idiot for not being here for you like I should have. And when I moved to New York, everything became about the work for me. I... I just kind of dropped the ball with everybody I cared about back here. Yeah, you kinda did. Yeah. Then I came back acting like I was gonna fix you. Acting like I was gonna fix everything. But I wasn't a match, and... then I couldn't find Clark. I just, I kind of feel like I just failed you all around, you know? You didn't fail me. - You're here with me now. - Yeah. Look, I know you. I know it's easier for you to lock down your feelings and focus on helping others. But all I need... All I need is for you to be my brother. My older, less attractive brother. Well, I can do that. Hey, so, uh... Winston called you the love doctor. Yeah. It turns out that people will ask for your opinion if you just call it advice. Okay. Well... I could use your advice, Doc. Let me guess. Sophie? Are you finally admitting it? You have a thing for Sophie? I never actually thought you'd admit it. - I owe Mom 100 bucks. - What? - Hey, hey, tell me everything. - Um, okay. Um... I may have already said some embarrassing stuff. - Okay. - Like, uh... that I tried to kiss her that night that we were coming home from that Springsteen concert. Yeah, at the gas station. - Yeah, I wasn't really sleeping. - You weren't? Dude. Okay, so what happened? I crashed and burned. Okay, so what are you gonna do now? I don't know. My instincts are telling me that I should just cut my losses and run, but I don't wanna do that again. Jackson, I know you. And when you think you're being so obvious, you so are not. Buddy, tell her how you feel. Don't beat around the bush. Now, what did you tell Winston? To put yourself out there. And damn the consequences. Yeah. Right. Hey. George, what are you doing here? You have every right to be angry. What I did was unforgivable and I know that. I was just so scared of losing you. And losing the boys. And losing my family. And it was hard for me, feeling second best. That was never the way it was between us. I married you because I loved you. I know that now. But back then, I was young, and I was insecure. And I was stupid in love. We could lose Jonathan because of what you did. Yeah, I know. And if I could go back in time and change it, I would. But I can't. George... I have never regretted our life together, not for a minute. You... you stepped up and saved me when I was lost. Made a home for me and the boys. And you were... Are. You are an incredible father. And I love you. Come here. Come here. Jonathan? Jackson, hey, open up! Open up. - I found her. - What are you talking about? We got a close family match from one of the ancestry websites. The profile was private, so I couldn't access the profile until the match came through. - Does this mean... - Jessie Del Rio. Your DNA matched with hers. And when I went to the profile, I found this. It's the same Bradford address and phone number. We had the right address. We just spoke to the wrong person. Hey, what's going on? Who won the lottery? Well, we did. That's Jessie, Clark's sister. You found him? No, we found his sister, but maybe she can help make the connection to Clark. Or maybe she or one of her family members could be the match we've been looking for. Oh! Isn't it great? Hello? Anyone home? - Oh, hi! - Who are you? Who do you want? My name is Sophie McClaren. This is Jackson. I called you the other day about Jessie Del Rio. Is she around? Look, we've been driving all night. - We need to talk to her. - My grandma owns this house. We don't know anyone named Jessie Del Rio. Okay, um... Well, is there anyone else that I can... Okay. - Clearly not a morning person. - No. No, no, no, we can't go yet. So, what? We just wait, then? For someone who doesn't even live here? Mm-hmm. Isn't that the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome? Well, I guess we're insane because we are not leaving. - Wow, Sophie, you are good. - Yes, I am. You know that night after the concert? It wouldn't have been just some meaningless kiss. What do you mean? I think that's part of the reason why I didn't come back here much after college. I was a little, uh, heartbroken. By your mysterious first love. - Yeah. - Yeah. I missed my chance that night. And even though I blamed Jeff Wizorski... Wait, wait, wait. What does Jeff Wizorski have to do with anything? Who do you think I've been talking about? Sophie... I was talking about you. You were the girl that no else could ever live up to. Uh... I'm sorry if this is a lot. Are you kidding me? I was hung up on you for years. Jonathan still hasn't let me live it down. - Are you serious? - Yes! I mean, why do you think I was so upset with you when you left? - So that night... - Yeah, I guess things could've been very different. Look, Anna said it was blue. But it was gray. Come on, let's go. Oh hi, excuse me. Jessie Del Rio? Yes? Hi, my name is Sophie McClaren, and this is Jackson Ford. - Ford? - Mm-hmm. And what can I do for you? We're looking for Clark Higgins. He's, um... He's your father. Oh, come and give your aunt Jessie a hug. I was always wondering if one of you boys would come looking. When my granddaughter called just now and said she scared away some lookie-loos. I had no idea. She listens to too many of those true crime podcasts. She thought you were casing the joint or something. No. You had a good reason to come here, didn't you? Yes, ma'am. It's my brother, Jonathan. He's sick, and we need to find our father. I think he'd love to meet you. This is surreal. If you'dve asked me a few weeks ago I thought that today we'd be meeting our biological father that we didn't even know existed... I would've thought you were nuts. You ready for this? Ready as I'll ever be. Jonathan and, uh, Jackson? Hi, um, you must be Clark. I'm Jackson. And, uh, this is Jonathan. Hi. Where to begin? Look, we're just happy that Sophie found you. Now that you're here with us now, the rest of it we can figure out. - I'm happy too. - Yeah. Here's Mom. - Clark? - Dorothy. - Dorothy, I'm sorry. - Why did you... I was afraid. And after my accident, I didn't know what to do. I... I didn't know how I could be father. It felt easier to be disappear, to give you and the boys a fresh start without me. I know it was wrong. I was all alone. I tried to come back. I know Anna saw me and Jessie in Boston. But by then, I was married to George. And... he threatened you. He was just trying to protect his family. He did what I couldn't. I knew he loved you all. That's why I had Jessie send that postcard. The boys had a father, had a family. It was too late for me to come back from the dead. It's not... too late. Never. Thank you. Look, I-I wanna know you both. I wanna hear everything. Um, there's something you all should know. Winston just sent me your test results, and Clark, you're a match! Jonathan, I wanna help. I want to do this for you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, we're off to kick cancer's butt! - I love you, darling. - I love you too, Mom. Here we go. Thanks again, Soph. For everything. For finding Clark, and for never giving up. I don't think giving up is in my DNA. - I bet I get that from my mom. - Yeah, I bet you do. I've been thinking about sticking around here for a while. I wanna be here for Jonathan's recovery and to get to know Clark. Yeah, no, I think that's... I think that's a good idea. You don't get second chances like this. No, you don't. You know, you Higgins-Fords have kind of inspired me. I think it might be time for me to find my birth parents. The package my mom left me, I think opening it is the first step to finding out who I am. And I didn't have the courage to do that... until now. - Look, I know it can be scary. - Yeah. But the truth really will set you free. I mean, look at me. I'm living proof of that, right? Well, how do you feel about grabbing a slice at Big Tony's this weekend? There's a pinball machine with your name on it. I'm still holding top scorer, so... You are so on. Great. I'd hate to miss a shot... at a second chance. - I'll see you then. - Yeah. My dear Sophie, If you're reading this letter, then I'm in a better place. Being your mother has been the blessing of a lifetime. I know that one day, you'll be ready to find the truth about where you came from. All I have to give you is this blanket wrapped around you the night you were placed on the firehouse steps... the night you became my daughter. I wish I could give you more. But I know you, Sophie McClaren. You are incredible at what you do. And I know with this one little clue, you can find all the answers you need. I love you more than you can know. Forever and always, Mom.
