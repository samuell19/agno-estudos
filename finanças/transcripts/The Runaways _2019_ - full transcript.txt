He's really cold now. The warm bit of him has gone up to heaven. Can we have chips for tea? Will you do me plaits? - My hands are greasy from the chips. - Doesn't matter. - Why are you so selfish? - I'm not. - She's just a kid. - So am I! Oh, no. Belle. - Trevor. - No Dad? - He's napping. - Working hard, playing hard. He knows how to live, doesn't he? - Do you know what I mean? - He's all right. I look after things. I'm surprised he can sleep with Blythe back in town. Has he said owt? Trevor, you nana! What's the problem with Uncle Blythe? Your dad had debts. Understandably, after what happened. When Blythe went to prison he sort of helped himself, do you know what I mean? No, we don't. Come on, Polly! Did you tell Belle that Dad was deaded? Have a wash, Trevor! No, she's such a nosy old cowbag she probably knows already. - Really? - No. Doesn't stop her being a nosy old cowbag though. - Moo. - Moo. Moo! Moo! He looks quite peaceful. It's over. Is it? Ah. There it is. All of life's rich tapestry. What are you talking about? Needlework. Get yourself a belt. Let's search the place. It's a locket, isn't it? Ben, Polly. - Angie. - Uncle Blythe. Been for a stroll? Your dad looks a bit off color. Angie? I'm sorry. Your dad had something of mine and me and Tuff were looking for it. What's happened? Come on, let's see if you've got your dad's strength, eh? All right. What do you think, Ben? If you had a brother, would you stand by him? Get inside, Ben. It's all right, she frightens me too. Your dad had the trawler. Everything else... it's mine. I'm the next of kin, so you better... You know all about social services and care homes, don't you, Angie? You've got until tomorrow. Twenty-four hours to pack up your stuff. After that I'll phone the police and save you the trouble. Ever since your dad put me inside... I wanted a release from all this... this rage. Best keep a fan near your dad's body, you know, what with all the flies these donkeys attract. You can wash up while you're there. How much? It's for emergencies only. Can we do Dad's nails? Yeah, I'm sure he won't mind. - What color? - Pink. I'm sure that's Dad's favorite color. We need to do something. - We need to do something. We can't stay here all day. - Why? You heard Blythe, he's going to be back soon. - Maybe he'll forget. - He's not going to forget! Well, he could get drunk and forget. What shall I do? We can't leave Dad. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. Let's do it. Are you sure? He'll be happy. He loved the sea. And it's us doing it for him, that's important. - Shall we pray? - Pray he sinks. One, two... - three. - My coat's caught! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! He, he, he... he sinks. I didn't even know he could write. - What a jerk. - Language. Where are the donkeys? - Jerk! - Language! - Ben, are you going to go in? - No. I will. Careful. Come on. - Oh. - Do you need help? I've got you. All right. We've got to be quick, remember, no lights. Go get some warm clothes. - What about a torch? - Yeah, that's fine. - Trekking ones, come on! - I can't put it in. - Don't matter. - Let's go. - I've got a blanket as well. - Oh, great. You better have a plan. You always have a plan, don't you, Angie? Is that Blythe's bag? Yeah. Come on, let's go! We can take one. I'll get one. - Billy Bob. - Tea bag. Tea bag is so small, we can't leave him on his own. And he's the funniest. Who loves the donkeys the most? Right, you two fill up two bags with hay, I'll meet you at Pollocks gate. Stick together. Will you be all right on your own? - Get Angie's bag. - You get it. ...add ten, take away four. 21, 22. No! 21s. You can not, you cannot win. You cannot win. Thank you, I will have that. That's your penalty... Hercules. I'm out. I'm out, I'm out. Jack. Billy Bob. Hold on to the sides. Mind your head. Hold the sides. Ere, which one of these donkeys is your new wife, Tuff? Ex-wife! Hey, Blythe! I think someone's making off with a couple of your donkeys! This is a piece of cake. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, let's split up. We'll pincer her in. You having fun yet? I can smell you. I can smell that fetid caravan. Can you hear me, Angie? Hey. Cross your toes and wish me luck. Down by the harbor. Come on! Flip flops. I'm tired. Really? Pull the other one. - How long's she been? - A fortnight! Ten more minutes and we're going back. Look! - Hello. - It's Angie! Hello. I love you. I love you as well, Sonic. Come on. - Tea bag. - Hello. Yeah, don't mind me. You could of got Billy Bob. Sorry. What are we doing anyway? Where are we going? Let's head in land. I missed you, Angie. Donkey's must have missed you too. Come on. Come on. This is what you call glamping. People pay good money for this. Do you think Uncle Blythe will find us? Stop calling him uncle. I don't want to be reminded that we're related. Answer Polly's question. If we don't know where we're going, how will he? I'm hungry. Ben will give you one of his bogeys. - Ben, can my worm have some of your bogeys? - No. It might be the only thing I get to eat all day. We need to get as far away from here as possible. Gently, good boy, Teabag. It's a big one. Angie? Does a heart attack hurt? There's a sign. - Ugglebarnby. - That sounds like a nice place. It could be full of little uggles. What? If we walk away from the sun in the morning we'll be going West. And if in the afternoon we keep it to our left, we'll be going West. If we keep going West we'll get to... The other side of the country? Away from Whitby. How far is that, the country? Look, we don't need to make any hasty decisions. We haven't made any of them, have we? Well, why don't we go and see the little uggles then? Because they don't exist. We need to sort out the bags so that the donkeys can carry them. - One potato. - Two potato. - Three potato. - Four. - Five potato. - Six potato. - Seven potato. - More. Come on, Polly. Bye, Daddy. My feet are wet. You're in school sandals, stupid. They're still wet but they're hot as well now. Come on, come on. It's the restored railway. The one to Pickering, the tourist one. - What, can we follow it? - No, we'll catch it! We'll be miles away. Come on. Come on, Teabag. Do they let donkeys on trains? Come on. Come on. Three minutes until it comes. Let's not mess this up. Okay, he's gone. Careful. This could be fun. Ben, you're going to have to go and distract him. - I always do it! You do it. - I can't do it. - Why? You can do it! You're fine with it. - Come on! - Talk about boring tractors. Now get going. - Shut up. When were steam trains invented? How heavy are they? Do you think a tractor would win a naught to sixty race? - Steady lad, steady. - Can I wave your flag? I haven't got a flag. Where do you get your coal from? Look, we don't use coal, we use coke, anthracite to be precise. You look like an important person. - Can I get your autograph? - Autograph? - Why, I suppose. - I haven't got any paper. You must have some in your office? Uh, I might have some paper, yeah. I've got these trains to sort out, I'll get some paper in a minute. Oh, well, I'll just wait over there then. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah, thank you. - Where shall we sit? - Donkey's don't sit, stupid. - Tickets. - We need to get as far back as possible. Tickets. Tickets. - We need to hide. - Hurry then. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets! - Tickets! - It's engaged. Tickets! I can't. I'm doing stuff. It might take a while. Are you all right in there? Whatever... You are kidding me. Tickets! Is anyone in there? What's going on in there? - I'm sat on my ass. - Look, don't mess with me. Are there two of you in there? Because that would be two tickets then. No... No. There are two of you in there! Look for my mummy. What's she look like? She looks... She looks... Teabag. You did a bad thing. You're funny though. Daddy would have stopped your treats for a whole week. I love you. Are we going to be all right? Come on, let's get moving. What, in this rain? I'm hungry! We'll have sandwiches when we get out of sight. You always say we can only have things later. - We're going to Mom's. - You what? She lives in Leyburn... - west somewhere over the moors. - And that's the plan? It's cold. Ketchup, Belle. Lost a couple of donkeys kidder? That's not the only thing that's gone missing, is it? That's where the real money is, swinging from her neck. A bit naughty that. I wonder where they've run off to? Families, eh? Ain't no rhyme, ain't no reason. You know what I mean, Blythe. Bloody families. Angie, you stupid girl. Mags, it's Blythe. Long time no see. Give us a call back. Something's cropped up with your kids. Is it so you can off-load us... on someone we don't even know? - So you're free. - I'm just clearing up your dad's mess. We need a map. Listen to them. I know. Will you show us the way, Daddy? The way is to stick together, Pol, like I've always said. Are you sure? Do we have to?

I like your tractor. It's a Ford County. You ever lifted a full 14 tons with it? Maybe. - What are they doing? - Having fun. What a stupid thing to do. - What, have fun? - Yeah, it's stupid. Ben, when were the last time you had fun? About three years ago. The last time you weren't with me. Shut up. You're the one who asked. Sonic, you're starting to smell better than me. Do you want to look after them instead? Hmm? Angie, I need a poo. Well, find a tree and you can use the leaves to wipe. This hawthorn will be good. It's got really big leaves. You git. Nowt your knickers. - Blythe. - It's Ben. We're on the moors. And Angie, she's gone crazy. We're near a small hedge, right by a lamp post... Trust me. Trust me. Mom will sort everything. What? Like when she left us, with you? Sorry. Oi! We're quits now. You're all wet. We've come from Whitby to Rosedale Abbey. That's where we are now. And then we keep going through... and then we need to get to Leyburn, there. We can't do that. If we are we better not tell Polly. Oh, tell her what? What are you doing creeping up on people? It's all right, love. Are you lost? Do you know how to map reading? - We're not stupid! - It's all right. It's no trouble. - Uh, are those your donkeys? Right. - Yeah. And are they going to Leyburn with you? How long have you been stood listening to us? You know what? You're pretty brave. We tried to get our donkeys on the trains. Oh, like, uh... like when, when Noah took them on the ark? We tried to hide them in the toilets. It were pretty funny. Well, I'm going to help you. How? Yeah. I've got a horse box. I can go and get it with my four by four. If you pay for petrol, and a little bit more... My name's John by the way. We don't need any help. We're not desperate. Oh, you feeling that? Not many people go up on those moors. Most tourists only go to two yards from their car. In fact, it must have been hard on your little sister, she's only young. Don't you have work? Have your donkeys been in a box before? - When they were babies. - Oh, good. Hopefully they'll remember. Have you heard of the, uh, the Poitou breed? Yeah, they're cool looking. Big shaggy coats. While Angie isn't here shall we share the last biscuit? Do you think that man, John saw this? No. So, why the donkeys? We couldn't leave them. They remind us of home. Don't you just love it... nostalgia? There's no future in nostalgia, only the past. If you say so. I've just got a quick errand, yeah? I'm just going to nip in and get a couple of letters. You can stay here, don't worry. No one's in. Come on. I'm going to go around the back to get some fresh air. You might as well come. I think it's a goat farm. It's been tough on Polly. Sometimes I wonder if I'm... Lost, stuck, wanting a dance? Well, you've got someone to help you now. I'm just going to nip in, see my friend, see if he's in the barn. You go and have a wander. I think the goats are around the back. Hey! Hey, John! John! It's a sign. It's a sign. It's a sign! It's a sign, it's a sign, it's a sign, it's a sign! It's a sign, it's a sign, it's a sign! - Shut up! Shut up! - It's a sign! Why are we doing this? Do you know? - Why can't we go home? - Go home then. - Go on! Go home! - No, I didn't mean it in that way. - Go on, I'm sick of looking after you! - Angie! You're rubbish at it anyway! - No, she's not! - I am! No, you're not! Angie! Well, you lost the money. Why are you taking it out on us? It's not fair! - Ben! - You're just like your dad. He was a stupid, lazy drunk. Angie, don't say that. I hate him and I'm glad he's dead! Angie, don't say that! It's not Dad's fault he's deaded, is it? Go on! Go back to Blythe and Social Services. I don't care! You turned me into a thief! Angie! Angie! Angie! It wasn't us, me and Polly, or Dad who made you do all that stuff, look after us. - It was Mom, when she left. - What are you talking about? You don't know what Mom was like, you just know - other people's gossip. - Exactly. - Well, it's irrational. - You think this is rational? You're rational? - I didn't want us getting split up. - And obviously we're all one big - happy family? - Stop arguing! You're always arguing. I can't stand it anymore. On and on, I'm just sick of you both. My ears are always bleeding, I hate it! At least we don't have to go to school. And you get to sleep with Teabag.

Get at least... ten. It's in great condition though and I love it so I was thinking more like 15 pounds? Yours? I guess so. I never thought to open it. It's a secret compartment.

Yeah, it was Angie who wiped your bum and changed your nappy. Urgh. - Why? - She's not a bad person. She loves you... for sure. Is this our life now? - Do you feel any better? - Yeah. Maybe we should give the donkeys a wipe? They're pretty grubby too. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to go for something a little more mellow now. Another Porch Lizard classic "I Couldn't Feel Better." You didn't expect that now, did you? Eh up, love, where have you been? Have you got any money? Oh! It's so itchy, that wig. Oh, God, blimey. Do you think Polly's cute? Cute as a picture cute. Couldn't be better. I tried to look after her, the best I could. Three square meals a day. Thanks. She's doing really well at school. Ben is too... but he can never be bothered to do his homework. Hmm. I have to nag him all the time. Sorry, I shouldn't have drunk so much on this medication. I think I'm going to go to bed. It's been a long day. Give it to me, it's mine. Your dad should have given it to me. This is going to hurt, sweetheart. As much as this! Angie, Angie. Angie! What was I thinking! Wanting you. Polly, Ben. Come on. Get out, get out! Get out! Get out! Get off her! Get out! Go! Get out! - You. - Angie! Get out! Go get the donkeys. I'll get something to wedge the door. - Let me out. Let me out. - No! No! Let me out! Don't go, please, don't go. - No. You're not coming near them! - Wait. Wait. I'm sorry! Well done, Sonic. They're going... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I've told... I've told your Uncle Blythe. I've been a mom for eight years. And I wanted a mom. Maybe that's why... I wanted her to take you. Because it's tiring. Will you forgive me? What shall we do? Which way did they go, Mags? You won't catch them. You haven't yet. And those donkeys have got more brains than your big toe. Come on, I'll make you a cup of tea. They were bigger than I expected. Stronger too. Time moves fast. She won't give it up easy. It's not the money. I'm the youngest. It's almost like you didn't deserve it. And Reith was so perfect, eh, Mags? Unfortunately you'll be the same with or without it. And that's why I'll sell it. That's Polly's coat. She'll be getting cold. - Wait. - I'll make a little hole. - You get that one. - Don't do that, it'll taste like sticks. Well, we haven't got any spoons. We made that fire. Yeah. We did. Are you warm enough? Yeah. I'll go and get some more wood. I love you. I love you. Stop being sad. - Chocolate for breakfast. - Where's that from? Mom's. - You little thief. - I got it for all of us. Have it if you want. I stole it for a disguise. Hi, I'm Maggie. Two hits. I hit you. You deserve this. - Do I? - Yeah. Great. I'll always look after you, Polly. Until you're a bit older and you want us to be sisters. A few frown creases. Can you find that wig for me? I need to see some old newspapers. Yorkshire ones, from about eight years ago. Ah, yes. Yes, they'll be over there on the microfiche. You'll find it, straight down there. There you go. - Boo! - Thanks. It's not a great disguise, is it, this wig? She talks to herself. We all think she's crazy. She was my mom until I was orphaned. What's it like in her house? Do you have pet slugs? All over the plates. Is she a bad person? You know bubble gum, she gives us sweets so we don't stick it in the keyhole. She must be all right then. Give me a break. Don't, don't stab my foot. Just pop the blister. - It'll hurt. - Oh, well. - Pop. - It's not popped, you've just poked it. - There are midges on your foot. - I know there are midges on my foot. I figured that out. I've got a plan. Let's trap him. Let's trap Blythe. Have you still got Blythe's number? He was in our shack. I got him on our home number. Okay. Look at his foot. - That is disgusting. - Really? We're going to have to chop your foot off now. - No! No, you're going to... - Go on, Polly, get his foot... - Did you find everything you wanted? - Yeah. There's not much is there, love. - That's the right money. - Thank you. Are you that girl? The one that's been on the news? Wait! Angie! Sweetheart. God! Happy families. - Am I doing this on my own? - Come on. - Angie. - Come on, Angie. It's only you're Uncle Blythe. - Angie. - We've been worried about you. I can only imagine the torment. We have. I have. We have. Where are you, love? Hey, I almost forgot. Drum roll please. Angie? We read reports and kept missing you. How are the two little uns? They're on holiday in the Caribbean! What? Now that is a big fork. Okay? Planning on having a big dinner. Come on. Shss. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. We can work it out. Come on... what would your dad say? - Don't hurt her. - Mags, get off! Do you know how I found you, eh? Money. All you've got to do is offer a little reward and you've got the eyes of Yorkshire. We saw your poster. Your spelling's really coming on. - Don't hurt her. - Maggie, leave it! In. In. You know... as family I should care about you, but... Let's call this you buying your freedom. Cheap at half the price. Don't think you're getting any, Maggie. You know what, I don't need it. I know why Dad sent you to prison and you deserved it. Oh, you've travelled some. Ain't you, Angie, huh? Just because you're screwed up doesn't make you special. - We're all screwed up. - Did you kill him? Finally a compliment. But sorry no. No, I didn't. He were weak. He gambled on that trawler and come up smelling of donkeys. And he took my locket. No, he didn't. He'd never do that. - No. He betrayed me! - He told the truth. - He betrayed me. - No. Your dad was a good man, and I never stood by him, none of us did. And that's why your gran-dad gave him the locket, not you because he'd lost respect for you, hadn't he? Out. He never had any. Get out! And you, get out. I need the coat! Go, leave me. - Oh, my God, what's that? - A tractor. JCB fast track. Take that, Mr. Sucks to be you. See you again in prison, Uncle Blythe. - You know, you've turned out all right, love. - I know. I'm sorry about the house, about what I did. I couldn't help it, really. Well, I've got Polly's coat. - She borrowed it. - Like the tractor. You know I've got problems. I can't look after you. It would be too much. It's all right. It's been good to see what we've been missing. And you've got enough kids to look after all ready. Did your dad still sing? Not country. You know... there's a girl on our estate, she's legal guardian to her sister. We could find out about that. We'll think about it tomorrow. We've got the donkeys to get. I like your hair too. You know, I always complained about brushing my teeth... but I'd quite like to do it now. Too right. Hmm. Can we sing Daddy's song? No, please don't. - You don't still hate him? - No. It's just painful. I miss him. This has made me realize how much he's given us. Weird ears? Each other. - You know I think we're going to be all right. - Yeah. I know we are. You know, I'm kind of glad you brought Sonic. I forgot how much I liked him. We should think about putting them out to pasture. Aspire to other things. Didn't you want to be a vet once, Pol? I want to work in a zoo now. I still think we should bury Dad at sea, when it's all sorted. I want to come this time. Maybe we could keep rowing. - Go all the way to France. - Why France? Because France makes the best ice cream. No, Italy makes the best ice cream. Isn't Italy in France?
