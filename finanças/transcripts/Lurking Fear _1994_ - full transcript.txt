(ominous music) (thunder rumbling) - Okay, don't panic and you'll be fine. Just let the weapon do the work. - Oh, Leigh, this is ridiculous. I've never handled a gun before in my life. I'll probably end up shooting myself in the foot or something. - [Leigh] To keep you safe. Always. Look. Look. - [Katherine] What about you? You wrote me and said you were too scared to stay. That's why I came to this place. - We are leaving, but not tonight. (thunder rumbles) She's not scared of anything. - Well, let's just get outta here. We'll walk you to town and we'll take the last flight out. - No chance. It's too dangerous outside at night. - [Katherine] Not as dangerous as having a loaded pistol around a baby. - Shut up, Katherine. I know what I'm doing. We're trapped here tonight. The flood channels cut us off, Kat. - That's okay, 'cause I called a cab. - Oh really? I cancelled it. - Perfect. - I'm sorry, we're not in San Francisco here. Katherine, it will be all right. It'll be just fine. - You know, you keep telling me that, and then you give me one of Dad's Vietnam souvenirs and you tell me to just pull the trigger. I don't think that's all right. - Do your crazy sister a favor and just hold onto it, okay? Just to make me feel better. - About what? - I don't want anything to happen to my baby. - It's after midnight. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, honey. I'm sorry. Storms always make me afraid. (thunder rumbles) (ominous music) (ominous music) Katherine! Get away from my baby you son of a bitch. (gun fires) Take her! - [Katherine] Oh my God. Okay. Okay, okay. (baby crying) - Are you all right? (growling) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (door squealing open) - [Voiceover] Four years dead for something I didn't do. The judge said I was a Martense and that enough was alone to convict me of anything. But now I was out. And no family, no prospects. Nothing to look forward to at all except an invitation from a petty thief who used to run with my father. He had something for me. Thieves stick together I guess. - Sidney. (chuckling) Sidney, Sidney. What happened? I'll tell you one thing, Sid, you look much better now than you ever did when you were alive. So don't worry, be happy. (chuckling) Very nice. - I hope I'm not interrupting a beautiful, personal moment. - You are, but what the hell? (laughing) - Hey, old buddy. - Hey, I heard you did pretty good, kid. - I wasn't anybody's bitch. - Oh, come on, you don't gotta tell me that. How you feeling? - I have to check with a parole officer every other day. I can't take out a bank loan and I can't vote, but I feel pretty damn good. - Yeah, I know. I know. You're still wearin' your con shoes. You know, they sent over a couple of pair for old Sid here. Couldn't decide whether he wanted to be buried in his oxfords or his loafers. Maybe they're your size. - Whoa, hey, I'll buy my own shoes, Knaggs. Thanks. - Yeah, and you're gonna be able to afford 'em now. (laughs) Did you bring it with ya? - [John] Yeah. - [Knaggs] Good. - Can't say that I know what the hell it is. (ominous music) Leffert's corners. - Yeah, it's a nut and about 200 miles south of here. Your Dad really liked the bar down there. - That's not news, Knaggs. So what is this? Floor plans of the pool tables? - Naw, it's a cemetery. And in that cemetery is buried a guy who is stuffed with money. - Bullshit. - Hey, this is your family legacy, kid. Your dad buried that guy just before he got sent away. - So how do you know that it's there? - Because I stuffed the stiff. Now, I didn't exactly count the dough, you understand, but let me put it this way, if you were to stand this guy up, he'd be pissing thousand dollar bills. (laughs) Your old man asked me to hang onto this for you. - Attica sent me his personal effects. Mine was in a birthday card that was never mailed. - Let's face it, kid. You and your dad don't exactly qualify for family of the year. But in a way, this kind of makes that up. - Hey, I just did five years. I don't plan on spending the rest of my life in prison. - So what are you gonna do? Walk away from this? Hey, that's fine with me, but I gotta tell you, your old man set this up so you wouldn't end up like him. - So what's your end, specs? - Well, I figure my half of the map is worth uh, a neat 20 percent. Of course, now that I know where it is... - [John] You'll take it all. - I don't need your fuckin' permission. Now I'm just tryin' to do right by an old friend at Christmas. All right? - What do you say you knock off early? You take us a little ride. - Yeah, I'd like that, but uh, I gotta hang around here. Somebody's gonna come to pick up old Sid. Why don't you go on ahead? I'll catch up with you later. - You're sure no one else knows about this? - Naw, I ain't seen them scumbags in over five years. Your dad was gonna protect you. Even now. - I'll see you tonight, buddy. - Okay. - [John] Oh, and uh, specs, bring your own shovel. (laughing) (ominous music) - Goddamn. Bastards. Got a little surprise for you tonight. (dramatic music) (gate squealing) (screaming) - [Doctor] Hold her still. - Give her something. - The last of the codeine and the heal of a bottle of bourbon are inside her right now. - I'm sorry, doc. - Oh, forget it. I'd be screamin' my head off, believe me. - I couldn't even see what it was. It was just on me all of a sudden. And, and then, I felt the blood in my mouth. - You'll be all right. You're fine. Listen, now that's just not too deep, all right. Listen, Beth, the first thing you gotta do is just pack this away. Healing starts from the inside, right. - But isn't this what everybody does? I mean, the ones who've lived through it. - Lie still now. I think you're gonna be all right now. One more. - Thanks. - Good. You just lay there and you try to relax. - [Katherine] How many did you get? - Four boxes, Sarge. - These haven't been turned in a while. The nitro's bleeding. - Really? - Doc. (explosion) - Wow. Well, I guess ah... We're ready to go to church. - I don't think this is such a good idea. - I'm not going back to my house. My baby's not safe there. - [Katherine] It's too dangerous. - Look, she's my patient. She's with me, I know she's safe. - Get in. - Ah-ha. Here it is. All set now. What? What is it? We're finally doing this, you trained, I kept my end. - This is what I thought the end of the world was gonna look like. (ominous music) - Maybe. Maybe not. (ominous music) Here's lookin' at you. (ominous music) - If you shoot a man, kill him, and you don't pull a gun unless you intend to shoot. You listening to me, boy? - Everyday. - Just trying to fucking teach you some things here. - [John] What? - What? What you're really are inside. A killer. That's part of you. (horn honks) (horn blaring) - Wow, Sid. You know, you're a lot more valuable dead than you ever were alive, babe. (laughing) (dramatic music) Can I help you, Miss? - Misses. I need to make some arrangements. - Oh, we understand. And, may I take this opportunity to extend to you my deepest condolences. - Yes, you may. It should be quiet, dignified. That's very important. - This is our forever yours model. It comes fully lined with soft, white silk. And uh, it has a heavenly blue body. It is a little more expensive. - Money doesn't concern me. - My dear... How's the world been treating you? - This'll only take a minute. - [Ms. Marlowe] Less time than that. - Ah shit. - [Bennett] I hear tales of riches. - Oh no, friend, you got it wrong. This here's a poor neighborhood. I can't refuse anybody. - So you won't refuse me then, will you? Well, there's a lot of money in death. Preventing it, causing it, taking care of the leftovers. Hello, Sid. You've done all three at one time or another, my dear. But there again I was forgettin'. You were always a modest man, weren't ya? - Hey, c'mon, leave Sid out of this. I gotta ship him up the coast tonight. His widow's waitin' for him. - Did you know they buried Dillinger without his schlong? Bastards, they cut it off. Put it in a pickle jar for a souvenir. You uh, you wouldn't do nothing like that, would ya? - [Ms. Marlowe] Shame on you. - Look at that. No wonder he's dead. - [Voiceover] Old man never told me about our family. He said we were orphans, and he liked it that way. The less I knew, the better. But when I turned towards Leffert's corners, I had a feeling I was going somewhere I belonged. I knew it like I knew the inside of a federal prison or a work farm. It was a bad feelin', but I had to keep goin'. Even though every goddamn thought I had was to turn around and get the hell away as fast as I could. (ominous music) (groaning) - [Bennett] You helped Martense rip me off. Don't fuckin' deny it. - I fuckin' told you, I don't know where it is. (coughing) - My pet prison guard brought me this. Where's the other half, Skelton? - I just prepped that body. I didn't bury it. - They will kill you, you know. - Wanna go for a split? - Ah. I knew you'd come around. I told you, didn't I? All right. 20 percent. Don't push me. - You know Leffert's corners? - Uh-huh. - There's a cemetery there. Martin's kid just left with the map. Left a couple hours ago. - Well, I should look forward to meetin' the lad. - [Knaggs] Oh shit. - You know, I liked the way you had the guy fixed up. He uh, he looked real natural. - [Knaggs] Thank you. (ominous music) - You lied to me, Skelton. That's what hurts. - I gotta go, I gotta go meet the kid. He's waitin' for me. We had a deal. - So did we. (gun fires) (groaning) (thunder rumbles) - The storm's coming in. - So is the dark. Let's go. - Bless this servant of God, Maria, with the holy body and blood of Christ the King for the forgiveness of her sins, and for life eternal. - Put it down easy. - Bless this servant of God, Ryan, with the holy body and blood of Christ the King, for the forgiveness of his sins and for life eternal. Drink the blood of Christ. - You should drink too, Father. Especially tonight. - It might make you feel better. - [Father] I told you I will not have the church, I will not have God's house being used as battle field. Not on the eve of his birth. - [Katherine] I didn't choose your church, Father. This is where they're hiding. - [Man] I'll go check the weather on the radio. - [Katherine] Storm will be in by midnight. - [Father] I expected more reverence from you, doctor. - Well, can I say, Father, nothing's left. You see, I just got tired of stitching people up just to watch 'em die anyway. For these. Bastards of terms turned into a slaughterhouse. - Now, you should be fighting with your faith and with this. - A book won't stop them. They'll tear it and you to shreds. - Oh, c'mon, Father. These damn things have been living under our feet and tearing us apart for 20 years. This is real. - I know that better than you. - [Doctor] You're just going to stand there and do nothing! - I'll give myself over if that's what it wants. Christ shed his blood for us, and I will shed mine for you. - [Man] It won't be enough. - You're gonna get yourself killed, for nothing. - Hey, hey Marie. You gotta stay here with us. You're not going to be protected out there. Hey, what are ya... - Let her go! At least she'll beat the sun home. - Gee, Doc. I remember you telling me that is safe if I got home before dark. Remember? (dramatic music) - Hey kid. Where is everybody? Wait. Do you know where the church is? (ominous music) - [Katherine] If they come up here the trip wire will nail at least two. - [Doctor] Huh? Oh yeah, booby trap safe. - Say, four would have been perfect for this. One time these charges out, cover the outside circle and save the rest. - Well, let's not mess around. Let's do it all. Wipe 'em out. - It's a waste until we can pinpoint the nest. I need backup. You never know when there's gonna be a second wave. - [Doc] You're the expert. - [Woman] No, I'm just doing what Leigh would. This is all I have left of her. - Your sister couldn't do it better. (clanging) - Yeah, she could. - Katherine. Katherine? - Yeah? - After we do this, let's find any place else. - Careful where you stagger, doc. - Yep. - We're hot. - The weatherman says an hour. - Oh yeah? Well that thunder tells me half an hour. - That'll still give us enough time to get to Miller's and get the gas truck. - Oh, this is going to be quite a party. - I know the Martense family record as well as I know the holy scripture. I know there was a bastard son of the clan, who escaped and went to live in the outside world. But he was a Martense, and killing came easy. He died in prison, the only Martense not to be buried in Leffert's Corner. We also know that he had a son. (ominous music) - Katherine, there's somebody out there. - [Katherine] What? - I saw something. - This is still a church. If someone's come for comfort, they deserve it. - I'll take care of it. - It must be one of those things. What about the 45? - [Doc] Hold off. Those things don't come up until the storm rises. - Hey, Doc. What don't you sober up, see if we can get to Miller's alive? Don't even breathe. Just stand straight up. - Baby, I'm not gonna move a hair. - I said straight. Take one step back to clear. Why'd you come here when everyone in town knows to stay away? - I'm not from town. - [Pierce] Now, I thought spec said he was gonna be alone. - Yeah, well they're certainly well prepared, aren't they? - Ah, looks like this Christmas is going to be a treasure hunt. - Pierce, this is a Porsche, not a Toyota. Well, I think before we get our hands dirty, a little spiritual counsel's in order. (ominous music) (banging) - [Father] You will never repair this damage. - [Doc] Well, (coughs) somebody's gotta do something, Father, and that ain't just you anymore. - Not here. I won't have that here. - Sorry, Father, I caught this one out back trying to defuse the dynamite. - You son of a... - Back off! I want answers. - Hey, I don't know what you people got going on here. I just wanna get the hell out. - No problem. As soon as we blow this cemetery you walk away. (thunder rumbling) - It's starting. - You cost me time. On him. (thunder rumbles) The timers are set to go off in ten minutes. - Hey, lady, I'm not waitin' for anything. - You got no choice. - What the hell is this all about anyway? - You shutting up and letting us do some good. And quit staring at me. (thunder rumbles) (screaming) - No! No! No! - [Katherine] Stop! Get back! (gun firing rapidly) - [Father] No! - [Katherine] The dynamite's gotta go now. (screaming) - [John] I've had enough of this shit. - Oh, God, I know I failed as your servant. Take your anger out on me, not this miserable souls who've gone astray. - Hey, freak show. (gun fires) (groaning) (ominous music) (thunder rumbles) Nice to see you kid. Now, you bring that flask water out, handle first. Real slow. (ominous music) - Now go on, let her up. Show a bit respect. (chuckles) Well, well. Eric's boy. - [Pierce] He loved Clint Eastwood. - Sorry to interrupt the service, my dears. Well, I'll make all of this very easy for you. I'm just here for the money. - Money? What money? - Now, I hate to disappoint you, Father. But you are not gonna decorate your lovely church with my investment. All right? Now you have a choice. One of you dies every uh... Ten minutes, 'till I get it. (thunder rumbles) - We don't know what you're talking about. We can't help you. - Well, then I suggest the good Father say the last rights over the whole fucking lot of you. - You always were a son of a bitch. - Cheer up Father. You might be meetin' your boss tonight. - All unplugged. - Now that we're all seated comfortably... Where is my money? - Can't you see that what's going on here has got nothing to do with you and your money? - Everything has to do with my money. (groaning) (ominous music) Put it down here, did you? - [Pregnant Woman] No, don't. If you break that down, we're all dead. You included. - [Man] Oh God, don't do that. What do you think, Randy? Is that what will happen? - [Woman] If we're lucky. - [Bennett] Is that what's with all the armour then? What are you protecting here? - Why don't you go down there and find out? - Because you won't. Come on. - [Beth] Don't do that! You'll kill her. Stop it. Can't you see she's the only one who can help up? - Don't be a hero, you're not the type. - Go to hell. - Hold it, Bennett. They don't know anything about the money. They got some whole different trip going on here, I don't know what the hell it is. I stumbled in just like you did. Your money is still buried. My father wasn't specific. I didn't get a name. - You better pray all you find is your money. - [Bennett] You better pray I'm not disappointed, darling. - Hold it. Hold it. That's my grandmother. That's gotta be it. (dramatic music) - [Bennett] Get rid of that. (thunder rumbles) - You dig, punk. - Hey, I'm not part of this. - Oh no? You murdered us all tonight. Congratulations. (gasping) - No. - Katherine, are you all right? - No. - Could you untie me, please? I'm on my way, Beth. You know, you picked one hell of a night to pull this little stunt. - You're the ones in the wrong place at the wrong time, Doc. Uh-uh-uh. - Father, my bag. It's all right, Beth. - This was supposed to be easy. - All right. - Doctor, I'm so sorry. - I know, I know. Let's just have a little listen here and what we've got. Shhh. Uh-huh. Well, I think you're gonna be fine. - Oh, I thought it was the baby. - No, no. I think it's the excitement. - So who's the father? (thunder rumbles) - He's gone. - Why, when you told him you were pregnant? Give me his name and I'll kill him. (ominous music) (thunder rumbles) - [Pierce] Not a goddamn thing. - You're just like your father. Stupid and dead. (gun firing) - [John] No! Ah, Jesus Christ. (screaming) (gun fires) Let go of me you son of a bitch. (grunting) - [Doc] Oh my God. Oh Jesus. No. - [Father] The devil has risen from the Sulfur pit. - She's not dead. Yet. (ominous music) (screaming) (gun firing) (screaming) (screaming) There they are. Nobody does a fucking thing until I say so. - Unless you want your goddamn head ripped off, I'd seal this up real quick. (gun firing) - Go away! - Fucking grizzly bear or something. - No! Stop, you'll hit the girl. Get back! - [Doctor] I'm trying. - Keep her back. - Hey, lover boy. Ooh, we really are good together. (ominous music) - Oh no, you and your friends know our little town secret. You wanna move in? I know a lot of places you can get for cheap. - What the fuck? That thing almost killed me. - Hey, that's the first time I thought it was on our side. (laughing) - When one offers no resistance, one invites evil. - Well, Father, I suggest you un-fucking invite it. - We know where they live. Tunnels everywhere. And we do know how they feed because this town has been in the goddamn dinner menu for 20 years. - Finally gonna do something about it, and you just fucked it up. - [Pregnant Woman] They devour every living thing they can, maybe leave the bones. - Find the stones. Bringing? - That's the legend. Hey, you've got some blood on your nice suit. - Oh shit. - Do you mind, bitch? (clanging) - Sorry, babe. You're just a little commando, aren't ya? - Casualties closed. Go on, break it up. (ominous music) - I think gettin' out of here is an excellent fuckin' priority. - I will tell you when to think. All right? Now, I hope you understand that Mr. Martense here has put all your lives at risk for refusing to cooperate. Now I don't give a toss if I have to feed you all one piece at a time to that thing down there on a silver fucking platter. All I want is what I want. So, who's gonna be first? - I can help you. I can. - Well, fuck me. - Here are the burial records, so you should be able to find what you're looking for. You came to me as a stranger, but I know your face. You can kill me and spare the others, can't you? - Are you gonna kill us? - How do you feel? - What do you think? I'm scared. - Yeah, that's not what I meant. You got something growing inside you. What about that? - How she feels is none of your damn business. If she has something wrong with her, I'll take care of it. - Soon, babe. (dramatic music) - Hey, Pierce. - Hey Sir, if you wanna talk to me, you pissant. Show a little to the man who's gonna kill ya. - Look, I think you know what we're really up against here. I mean, you took a shot at it for Christ's sake. - Let's see. I shot the undertaker, and that boy that you had your arms wrapped around. I think, I kill you next. - Look, I just wanna get out of here, and the only way that that's gonna happen, is if you get your cash. - Bennett's taking care of that right now. See, you've got nothing to fuckin' offer. - That priest doesn't know shit. He was stalling. Your boss is gonna be hung up for hours. Now, I can give you the map. You just gotta let me out the door first. - What about your new friends, John boy, huh? What about them? - Fuck 'em. Hey Pierce, if you know where the money is, you divide the shares your way. Or no shares at all. - Five years ago the boy's father robbed my casino and buried the money in your cemetery. Martense, crypt of the family. They also have a sense of humor. This is the name of the cop who busted Martense and sent him up. This is the money grave. Very clever. - Well, the Martenses own us. Always have. - Not any longer, Father. Dad is dead, and I've got the boy. - They have relatives. (ominous music) - The old man always said you were chicken shit, made your pocket money robbing queers and old ladies. - When I was feeling lazy, yeah. But when I had to drop somebody, I didn't back off. - Ah, tough guy, I forgot. - Don't swing your dick with me, boy, or I'll cut it off. Oh, you wanna make a move? Huh? No, you don't. You know, you're just like your old man. Yellow-bellied, scum sucking pig. - It's your money now, Pierce. - If I don't see it in about one minute, I'm gonna start carvin' on you. (grunting) (groaning) (dramatic music) Do me a favor and kill me slow. I just gotta watch what Bennett does to ya. - It's not gonna be that easy, Pierce. - You should never draw down on somebody unless you're gonna shoot 'em. Didn't nobody teach you that? (groaning) (choking and gagging) - Well, my dear, it looks as if being dead's the answer to your problems. - Don't think so, my dear. Uh-uh-uh. - Pierce! I'm gonna fire that bastard! - Looks like something around here doesn't give a damn about your money. - Seems like it runs in the fucking family. (dramatic music) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Hey Bennett, I owe you a bullet. Where do you think I should put it? In here? - I'm really sweatin', babe. I've always dreamed of a church wedding. - All secured? - No problem. I guess you gotta trust somebody sometime, huh. (thunder rumbling) - Hey. Take it easy. - How do we look? - Naw, there's not time to hook everything back up. - Yep. I figured. - Hey, um... If I don't make it back... I'm gonna get the truck. - Okay. Listen, what about your new boyfriend in there? Mr. Martense. - If he does anything stupid, kill him. - Well, okay. (dramatic pipe organ music) - Will you say one for me, Father? He was a lovely lad. Loved his mother, sent her flowers. He was nice to go fish. - [John] Lay off. - I think the father understands me now. You don't. - [Beth] Doc, where's Katherine? - She'll be back. I have to have the gun. - Now, this son of a bitch needs watchin' all the time. - I know. - I don't trust you, do I? I wonder why. - Thanks for the light. (dramatic music) (ominous music) (thunder rumbling) - Poor Father. All that planning, all that construction, and you guard your... - [John] Can I borrow the plan? - No, it's not, Martense. And I'll you what you are. You are nothing but an incompetent faggot, who's gonna be strung up by his nostrils, have his balls ripped off - (engine turning over) (dramatic music) (thunder rumbles) - I need a drink. Can I trust you? - I don't know. I just might lose control. - I got enough for both of us. - Hey Doc. Can I steal your lighter? - You stand way over there, how are you gonna find out what I taste like? (coughing) - Ah. Forgive me, Father, I've sinned. Jesus. Well... - I thought I'd be afraid, but I'm not. (ominous music) I knew we'd be brought together. - I heard you pray for me to come. - So I can make amends to my God. - You called me Satan. - Because that's who you must be. In the name of the Father, when John Martense sits in my chapel as your son, and of the son, and Mr. Bennett is here as his messenger and of the Holy Spirit. I am prepared to sacrifice myself. Would you consider sparing the others of this parish, and taking my soul as your ultimate victory? Will you see your martyrs assured a place at the right hand of God, and though I walk through he valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil... - Thank you. This will be so good. (dramatic music) Would you mind? - Isn't it romantic? Huh? All right, lover boy, let's see if you can use a shovel. (knocking) - Father? Goddamn Martense. You son of a bitch. (laughing) Oh, sweet Jesus. (screaming) - [Bennett] Try not to cut your foot off. - [John] If that thing comes back up, I'm dragging you down with me, Bennett. - [Bennett] You've got influence. - [John] What do you mean I got influence? - You got the birth mark on your shoulder. - Yeah, how the fuck do you know? - The good Father told me. The Martense brand. (thunder rumbling) - Oh my, baby's really tough. Come on. God, you must be a lousy lay. No energy. - Forget it babe, you don't have the guts to really shoot somebody. - You're right. - [Bennett] What the... (screaming) (dramatic music) (exploding) (dramatic music) - [Doctor] Katherine. - [Katherine] Oh Doc. - [Doctor] It's here, it's here somewhere. - [Katherine] Oh Doc, no. - [Doctor] It's here. - [Katherine] No. - No, don't even try. Go, go go. - [Katherine] Doc, I said no. - Finish it! (screaming) Katherine! Katherine. (ominous music) - You're finally gonna be of some fucking use, my dear. - The grave was empty, Bennett. Let's get the fuck out of here. - The crypt. Your dear father told me. Go on. Let's go. (yelling) (ominous music) - [John] Oh shit. (groaning) - Fucking disgusting. Look. Look at that! Look at your shoulders. He's one of you. Martense! - What the hell's goin' on here? - It's your family reunion. Dad ran away as a kid so he wouldn't be eaten for breakfast. Your family tree is rotten, my dear. - [Demon] We are Martense. If you fight, the pain will be worse. - I'm guessing you don't have your gun. - If I had my fucking gun would I be lying here like this? Why don't you do something about it? You're one of them. - [John] No I ain't. - [Bennett] More money as a fucking maternity bed. - They wanna tear her baby out. - Your young will feed our young. Your blood will be our blood. - Don't let them do it. For God sake. - Get back, you ugly sons of bitches. Come on. Back. Back it off. - Put the fucking arm out! They're ripping up my money. - Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on. Get back, get back, get back. (ominous music) (growling) (coughing) (sobbing) - Get up here. Let's go, let's go. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Thanks for the light, Doc. (dramatic music) (growling) (dramatic music) - Hell fire, just like bull said. - My God. - [Voiceover] As Leffert's Corner's burned, all I could think about was who I might be inside. The killer or something worse. Had I really come home? That's what I'm living with now. I know my name, but I don't know who I am, and until I find that out, my prison sentence goes on for life. (ominous music) (dramatic music)
