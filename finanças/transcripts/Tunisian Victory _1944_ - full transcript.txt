Nothing like these two armadas had disturbed the waters since the world was made. This is a combined operation, an operation that began some four months earlier in Washington D.C. ♪ [music] ♪ The President of the United States welcomed the Prime Minister of Great Britain. The gravity of the moment had brought them together. The lights burned all night that night in the White House where the two leaders met with their combined Chiefs of Staffs. For this was the picture taking all too definite form in the minds of the civil military and naval leaders now locked in secret conference. Two Axis spearheads were headed East. In the North, Von Bach pursuing his way through the Ukraine to the caucasus. In the south, Rommel was driving toward the Egyptian border. These two spearheads were intended to meet in Iran and head eastward towards India. In the orient, Japan had occupied the Coast of China, the East Indies, Malaya and Burma in preparation for their drive westward through India. If these two enemy spearheads were allowed to meet, Russia and China, except for their remote optic ports, would be completely isolated. Japanese raw materials and German production would be combined. The peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa, seven-eighths of the world's population would be enslaved. -By morning a decision, both bold and revolutionary. Bold because in this our darkest hour we dared to take the offensive. Revolutionary because that offensive was conceived, planned and executed by the peoples of two nations. The time and the place have been agreed upon. [printing] The code name for the combined operation was Acrobat. The two great elements were time and secrecy. A hundred and twenty-five days in which to plan and launch the offensive from basis of 3,000 miles apart. An operation involving hundreds of thousands of American and British soldiers and sailors, millions of American and British working men and women. Only by whose combined efforts for the plan to become a reality, but from whom the plan itself was to be kept secret. A few score men and no more knew in its entirety the plan for this greatest of combined operations. In London and Washington, British and American officers were placed at adjoining desks to work through the days and nights of grind and toil that lay ahead. And gradually in the enforced daily intimacy, men grew to know and respect each other, thus was born the relationship out of which an allied army came into being.

At a given point West of Gibraltar, the British convoy would divide. For 12 hours the two halves would proceed in opposite directions, then the second half would reverse its course and follow the first passing Gibraltar 24 hours behind. Thus with clock-like precision, the combined operations would begin with simultaneous landings at Casablanca, Oran, Algiers. Casablanca to protect our flank against an Axis attack through Spanish Morocco. Oran and Algiers to secure bases from which to press Eastward. Then the occupation of Tunisia from which we could cut Rommel's supply lines across the Mediterranean. Next to trap and destroy Rommel's Africa core between our Allied forces and the British Eighth Army. Thus, one arm of the Axis Pincer would be amputated and supply lines around the Cape of Good Hope would be shortened by half through winning control of the Mediterranean. -[Narrator 2] North Africa would be ours with bases from which to stab at the heart of the Axis Citadel. Those were the main objectives of the plan called Acrobat. In both convoys, the men kept fit now knowing the task that lay ahead. For most of them, this voyage was a new experience.

The enemy knew nothing until the last possible moment when the first half of the convoy from Britain steamed past the Fortress of Gibraltar. -[Narrator 2] It was at night that the ships passed through the straits. The time had been carefully chosen. For here, in narrow waters, attack seemed certain. Aboard ship and on the rock, everyone stood to, but the ships moved steadily on. It was as though for the moment, the enemy's sword had fallen from his hand through indecision. This time it was in Rome and in Berlin that the lights burned all night.

Their purpose, to design the shape of victory in Africa and beyond. First, a meeting was arranged between Generals de Gaulle and Giraud who had succeeded Admiral Darlan, assassinated a month earlier. Out of the meeting was to grow the union of the fighting French who had never lost hope and the French for whom hope had been reborn. Second, the united command for the new Tunisian campaign was created. The Allied troops in the area were now predominantly British, but by common agreement, General Eisenhower continued in supreme command. As his deputy commanders, three British officers. General Alexander on land, Admiral Cunningham on sea, Air chief marshal Tedder in the air. Under them, British, American, and French officers and men serving side-by-side. The whole scheme, a dovetailing of command unique in military campaigns. Third, we fixed the terms which would end the fighting, unconditional surrender. Of all these decisions, our Russian and Chinese allies were kept fully informed. The conference ended, Mr. Churchill flew on to Tripoli to greet the victorious Eighth Army and explain its vital part in forthcoming events, for the decisive hour was at hand. -Battle lines were drawn. ♪[music]♪ In the North stood the British first army. In the center, General Giraud's French troops. In the south, the Americans. Further South a small group of fighting French had completed its historic 1,500 mile march and taken up positions on the left flank of the British Eighth Army which faced the formidable Mareth Line. Behind which barrier, Rommel's army, after its long retreat and entrenched itself, Tunisia was drained with German troops, 15 full divisions. ♪ [music] ♪ No scratch troops leaves, but battle wise veterans of Poland, France, the Balkans. They together with seven Italian divisions were armed with the most modern types of equipment, including the newest fighters and bombers of the German Lochbach.

Keep control of the Mediterranean.' -Rommel standing behind his Mareth Line saw that he must soon be faced with an attack in the rear from the allied armies along the Great Dorsal as well as an assault by the Eighth Army at Mareth. He therefore struck first, in an endeavor to remove the menace behind him. On February the 14th, the blow was struck. Heavy armored columns burst out of Faid pass in the mountain barrier and through into the valley beyond. In the face of their onslaught, Allied armor withdrew with heavy losses. By the 21st, the enemy had forced his way through the Kasserine Pass and his armored columns were advancing in a three-pronged thrust. One main column aimed at Tebessa, our supply base in Southern Tunisia and another at Thala, key town in our lines of communication. Almost within sight of his objective, he was halted. American, British, and French forces all stood immovable against the final impact. And in counter-attack broke it. While Allied air power pounded Rommel's lines of communication and supply. The threat was ended. Advancing past destroyed German armor, we reoccupied Kasserine Pass and by March the 17th, the original battle lines had been restored. As soon as Rommel saw that his Westward thrust was doomed, he made an abortive attack South against the Eighth Army. The Germans unveiled the new tiger tank, the British the new 17-pounder anti-tank gun. ♪[music]♪ [explosion] Fifty-two tiger tanks were left burning hopes. From then on the initiative was ours. -Of the various strategies which might now be employed against the enemy, General Eisenhower chose one which envisage the entire military situation in terms of a cylinder. The Western Wall Allied land forces along the Great Dorsal. The northern and eastern, Allied air and sea power concentrated in the Mediterranean. The seaports of Tunis and Bizerte were to act as the intake valve through which those enemy troops that escaped the devastating attacks of planes and submarines based at Malta were to be sucked into the cylinder. At the bottom of the cylinder stood the powerful British Eighth Army to serve as the piston which in its upward stroke would push the enemy into an ever-smaller space. Still in possession of the enemy were certain high hills to the west of Tunis and Bizerte. Their capture was an essential part of the entire strategy, for these hills were the spark plug. Which, when the piston had forced the enemy into a state of high compression, would explode the combustible mass. That was the final strategy. To succeed, perfect coordination would be necessary between land, sea and air forces. The Northwest African Air Force commanded by General Spaatz was divided into five major groups of which three were combat. The Strategic Air Force under General Jimmy Doolittle. These were the big boys, the long-range bombers, pounding away at enemy bases and shipping. The Coastal Air Force under Air Marshal Lloyd, day and night fighters these, protecting ports and convoys. And finally the Tactical Air Force, a new conception of air power developed by the British in the Middle East. All fighters and attack bombers, British and American, were placed under one command so that we can strike with a full force of our flying artillery when and where it would do the most good. Air Marshal Cunningham in command of this group and General Alexander in command of all ground forces lived and worked side-by-side in a tent camp in the Tunisian mountains. Their's was a complete partnership and in it lay the pattern of ultimate victory. By the middle of March, the stage was set. The first move was up to Air Marshal Cunningham. ♪[music]♪ In a continuous 24-hour assault, the Mareth fortifications were pounded from the air. ♪ [music] ♪ ♪[music continues]♪ Then General Alexander gave the signal for the Piston to begin its upward stroke.

[explosions] As our infantry went forward, engineers and pioneers built roads across the mountain tops for vital supplies to reach them. In 14 days, they built 11 miles. - Meanwhile, further north, the Americans had embarked on their phase of the campaign. This started with the assault on Hill 609, long-range artillery started the attack. [cannon fire] [intermittent explosions] - Gretchen's all batteries, left eight, Baker, Baker. [explosions] [gunfire] [sounds of shoveling] - We took Hill 609. And when as many of us guys, when we got to the top as there'd been at the bottom, we took it. - Thus one by one Thorne-Arnhem strongholds in the mountains fell. The Germans had been out fought, now they were to be outwitted. General Alexander knew their fear of the Eighth Army so he reinforced that fear with heavy bombardments and local attacks from Montgomery's front. At the same time, he secretly transferred the fourth Indian and the First and Seventh armored divisions from the Eighth to the First Army in the North whence the main attack was to come. - Spark plug was ours and we were now ready to explode the combustible mass. Now to pour on the power, now to give the apostles a power in education and the use of it. ♪ [music] ♪ ♪[music]♪ [propeller and engine sounds] ♪[music]♪ British and Americans in the air with everything that could fly. ♪ [music] ♪ [engine noise] British and Americans on the ground with everything that could shoot. ♪ [music] ♪ [engine noise] [gunfire] French artillery, French infantry. ♪ [music] ♪ [explosions] [gunfire] The British Navy. ♪ [music] ♪ [explosions] All poured forth their concentrated fury. ♪ [music] ♪ [cannon fire] This was Blitz warfare such as the inventors of the Blitz had never dreamed of.

Another British column raced around the tip of the Cape to prevent any evacuation. The whole axis mass was split into four segments. The end came quickly. - By tens, by hundreds, by thousands they came on foot, in trucks, and behind their band. ♪ [music] ♪ The greatest mass surrender of fully equipped troops in modern history. -We had lost nearly 70,000 men, dead, wounded, and missing. Thirty-five thousand British, 18,000 Americans, 15,000 French. But for every man we had lost, the enemy lost five. And at the end, 15 full divisions, 266,000 of their best men laid down their arms. - No baton this, no Crete, no men riddled with disease and shrunken with hunger fighting to the last barehanded. Educated in the school for power, they were quick to recognize superior power. And when they did, they quit, quit cold. This is the end of the Axis African adventure. - After all the racket, it seems funny, don't it, Joe? So quiet. - Yeah. - What's biting you Joe? - I don't know, I can't help thinking all the hard work that went into those burnt out tanks and half tracks and airplanes, gone for nothing. - Had to be done. - Oh sure it did, but still in all, think of all the trucks and automobiles and things. All that junk might have been. - I know, bloody shame. -Just because he was told that he was a Superman. - Well he never figured things out for himself. Never argued the toss same as we do. Too bad he didn't hear some of our arguments of the old dog and fox back home. -You know I guess that's the real difference between us and them. We argue the toss [undecipherable] and they don't. - Yeah and when you don't argue the toss anymore you aren't half a man anymore. You're just a blooming tool like a spanner or a saw or a gimlet. - Maybe they like it that way. - Maybe they do but suppose somebody tried to use you or me like that Joe. Suppose somebody said, "Put that fella's eyes out or turn a horse pipe on that Jew or on that woman." Would we do it? - What do you think? - You and me Joe, we may not always think alike, but we do think, you and me and old Alphonse. Then the rest we certainly think, all right. - You know George, I got an idea. Why can't we after the war, the same work gang I mean, keep on swinging together? What couldn't we do? - You mean build more houses than ever was? - Yeah, that's it. - And ships, thousands of ships? - Right. - And food, so that nobody be hungry no more? - Yeah, building things up instead of blowing things up. Like I, I don't know like dams in the desert and roads through the jungles, maybe bridges across all the oceans. We could do it, I bet you. - Yeah, do all the jobs at once doing and knock the block off anybody who wants to start another war and bring the smiles back to the kids' faces all over the world. - Boy, what a job. - But just know Joe it's the same rough road, the same road you and me have just come, the same bloody hard road and for quite a while yet. - Boy oh boy, what a job, bringing back the smiles to kids' faces. ♪ [music] ♪ [cheering] - Africa is free and Europe that much nearer freedom.
