How's your head? Fine. Oh, good. Better. Oh Maureen, I don't wanna fire people. I don't wanna lose control of my life. I just wanna teach and write. I don't wanna be chairman. Besides, I'm not mean enough. Well, you don't have to be mean, David. Really, I mean, you'd be teaching and writing, you know, if you were chairman. You're just gonna have to learn to be a little more assertive with people. I'd be hated, it's not worth it. And why would they hate you? The law of academic jungle. People hate the chairman, okay. The law of the land academia. You guys hungry? Hey, let's stop for pizza. Mmm, sounds good. No, I want a hamburger at Bittie's, a cheeseburger and I do not want them to melt the cheese. Okay, Bittie's, and I'll tell them not to melt the cheese. Or if they melt the cheese, daddy will eat it. I need food or I'll die by malnutrition. Of malnutrition. Hey, okay, let's do quotes. Oh, come on, let's play a game I can play for once. Ah, just one quote. I've got one for you, David. Hit me with it. You must laugh at men-- To avoid crying for him, Napoleon. Yes, what an egghead. What's an egghead? It's a small professor, a nerd. What's that, honey, your bunny? You dropped your bunny. At Bittie's, I want lots of fries and a coke. The usual for everyone? Yes, please. Who's bunny rabbit is that? Do you remember the usual, dad? Hey pretty, your hot still? It's hot. Okay, two Bittie burger deluxe, hold the mustard on one. Cheeseburger, no ketchup, no onions, no mustards, lots of fries, two Diet Dr. Peppers, a coke, and a milk. Oh, here's your blankie. Hold it, hold it, no cheese! No cheese? No chairmanship. No ambition, Bagabond from Genesis. Emily Dickinson. Make room, I'm coming into the backseat now. I want humongous fat fries for myself! You do? Well, my precious, your father's gonna bring them to you. Oh yes. Why's it taking so long, mom? Well, your daddy will be right out, honey. I'm hot. Mommy, who are they? I'm gonna see you and ...hot dogs up your ass! Whoop, here he comes, look at him. Looks like he's mad to me. Come on! He ain't gonna come ...chicken shit. Better run, here he comes. Here, eat this. Come on! Get the hell out of here. Okay, sweetie. I'm cold. Here comes your dad with the food, here he is. I'm sorry, Barry, you all right? Hey! What you roll the window up for? Because of, maybe we should take it home, David. Well, I saw those two this morning, David, at the Winn Dixie. Just a couple rednecks had a few beers, no big deal. Why don't you get in the car and eat? Nah, I wanna stay outside. Why don't you eat in the car with us? I am with you. It's nice out. You should come out here. Roll up the window. David! Roll up the window. Dad. David, get in the car! David! Daddy! Help! Boy, that's a nice car you got here, bud. He like that, give him another one. Feel better? Don't you touch my brother. Put it on him right now! Yes, get another one on him! Yeah! Get out of here, get out of here! Come on, Cal, we gotta go. The police wanna talk to you, Maureen. I'm gonna bring them in. My name's Barelli, Sergeant Barelli. This is Officer Palmer. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Might hit 90 out there today. They sure got good air conditioning in this hospital, I'll give them that. Mrs. Dietz? Mrs. Dietz, we've got to ask you a few questions. Maybe we ought to catch up with you first. We got a good description of the two men. The big one had a baseball cap. You remember that, don't you? And the bat, that was... But what can you tell us about them, the truck, what they said to each other? The bat's aluminum, the handles taped-- They were after me. They followed me from Winn Dixie. David... Got in the way. The Winn Dixie, we'll check it out. Now, is there anything else you can remember? Cal. The big one called the other one Cal, Cal. They're gonna come back for me. We'll find them, Mrs. Dietz. That will be it for today, officer. They won't be coming back, Maureen. Hey, how you doing? Great. Start without me, huh? Hey, hey, oh, I see you did. We just paid the check too. Yeah, is it still hot? Warm. Well, I guess you're all wondering why I'm late. Just beginning to wonder. Well, I have been recruiting. Have you now? Yeah, yeah. A good kid out of Port Charlotte wants to play tight end. The grades a little low but he was hoping some big division one school would wanna take him. But weighing only 185 and with low grades, hey, fat chance. But at a small Catholic college like ours, he can make a name for himself, maybe beef up a little bit. Name Mendoza, Chico Mendoza, ever hear of him? Oh yeah, wasn't he the guy who played for The Monkees. Oh yeah, very funny. Yeah, he was the-- No, he's a little English guy. That's dirty, he laughed like Ruprecht in Dirty Rotten Scround-rels. Scoundrels. Maureen Dietz, hi. Hello. I'm Franz, Franz Halmer, do you remember me? Franz Halmer. My wife, Louise and I, were at Bittie's that night. I remember. I'm just out from town here for a few days and we have two little girls right now. Oh, that's nice. I'll never forget this night. Those two guys coming after you, the small one with the baseball bat-- I think that will be about enough. Nice weather we've been having lately, don't you think, Mr. Halmer? Hi, I'm Mike Witherspoon. I think I'm gonna go back to my table now. It was nice seeing you again, Mrs. Dietz. Good idea. Hey, hey, okay, who wants a last slice, going once, going twice, going to the slender, handsome guy in the green t-shirt. I want it! Take a bite. He was there when they killed my father. He's an asshole, he just stood there while some neanderthal just hit him. Not now. Please, Barry. I think Miss Daisy's ready to call it a night. Barry, will you take my car home? Daisy and I will follow with Mike. What did I do, I just told the truth? Look, all right, forget it. Mind if I give you a little friendly advice? As a man who has survived one less than ideal marriage and raised a daughter who's never listened to one word I've ever said, I suggest you let him get it all out. A little crying, a little yelling. Otherwise, someday he may blow his... It's good halftime therapy. Why don't you let me decide that one, coach? Thank you. Well, your carriage awaits, Miss Daisy. Shall I carry you? But I'm too old. Princesses are never too old to be carried. You sure you want to get involved with this team, coach? You kidding. Give me a full season, I'll have this whole franchise turned around. I suddenly felt shaken in a way which I've never experienced before. Shakespeare. No, Wild Strawberry. ♪ Do, do, do, da, da, da ♪ Barry, I'm home! Okay, pumpkin. Why don't you head upstairs, put on your PJ's, brush your teeth, and hop into bed. Mom. What? I'm not sleepy, can I stay up late? No, tomorrow's a school night and we all ready had a nice celebration. It's time, my lady. Let me show you to your boudoir. Ah, the innocent sleep. ...ravel sleeve of care. Hi, mom. Sorry, I was just... Your key's on the table. Thanks, honey. Where you been? Oh, we stopped at, stopped at Mike's on the way home. How's Daisy? She's tired, going to bed. Any calls? Some woman, I left her name by the phone. Gates, Helen Gates. Gates. I don't know anyone named Gates. I think she's with Salvation Army or something, looking for a donation. She said she was a Sergeant. ...all ready, my lady! Yeah, I'm coming. There's only the present, there's no..., there's no people, there's just now. Remember me, I'm Helen Palmer. Class is dismissed for the day. Thank you very much, you all did very well, especially you, Carla. Go to the pool, minimum of five laps. I'll see you there in a bit. Thank you, Francine. Your name was Gates, you wore a gray suit. You got a good memory. Mmm hmm. I married a cop named Gates, actually known as Squeaky, and we're working out a divorce. No women bonding small talk, huh? You figure I've got bad news. Look, this was Barelli's idea, not mine. Here. Barelli was my partner. You met him in the hospital that day. Well, he died Saturday. And he wanted you to have this. Two years ago I was leaving work late. Maureen Dietz? I couldn't forget you! Stay away from me. But I got something for you. You were right, they are coming back! Take it, take it! I don't want it! I didn't want the file. But it looks like I can't walk away from it. I understand you don't wanna think about the past. I heard you talk to Carla Rue. But Barelli left a note asking me to give you this. Do you know what's in it? Well, if you wanna know what's in it, read it! Read it, it makes good sense! I mean, there's, there's some nonsense. So what part of it isn't nonsense? Well, Barelli traced the baseball bat, nothing. I mean, a baseball bat is a baseball bat, right? Barelli went to every store in Florida that carried that bat. You know that guy, Bittie, who owns the hot dog stand? I know. Well, he said that their license tags were Florida. Did you notice that? Well, Barelli used his weekends off, his vacations, and then his retirement to check every dealer in the state that handled pickups. It's crazy, huh. It's crazy. Well, crazy or not, you know what he found? Nothing. Wrong, two months ago, he found them. Or at least he found out who they probably are. A big man and a crazy smaller man bought a 1978 Ford pickup in Ocala. This time, Barelli struck gold. Blood? Well, if you want to put it that way. These two men paid cash and then they left this address in Arcadia. So, Barelli went to Arcadia. A Calvin and Marty Vanbeeber had lived there. But they had some run in with a tavern owner over drugs, and they just took off, who knows where. So what you're telling me really was, was-- That he was a bigoted sexist who got drunk on the job and probably would've gotten me killed if he hadn't been drummed out. But you got to him. It happens in this cop's... Barelli wasn't that bad of a guy. Listen, I've gotta go. What do you want me to do with this? Read it. And you do what you think is right. Are you going back to Tampa? No, I'm on vacation. I'm hiding out at the beach from Squeaky, from whom I'm still technically married, and a district attorney who turned into Mr. Hyde after two months of living with him. You workout? Probably not as much as I should, but I do run and I workout a little, you know, to keep in shape. I'd like you to meet my children. Maybe you'd come by my house, we can go for a run. Okay. You take care of yourself. You finished yet? Yeah, I finished it. Well, I want your opinion, what'd you think? I don't know. It seemed like the guy who put all that together was a little nuts, you know? I think I'd probably be... Yeah, but he was right, they killed David. Yeah, he was right. But he sure was a fanatic, I mean. This guy, this cop, what's his name? Barelli. Barelli, right. I mean, did you ever stop to think why he did this? I mean, he really cared about you, the kids. And what happened to David. Michael, what's the name of that man you know at Channel 40? Donnie George, what about him? Would you call him for me? I wanna talk to the television stations and I wanna talk to newspapers, and I wanna make some attempt to find these guys. Donnie George works the sports spot. Well, it's a small station. Small network affiliate station. That's good, yeah. Do you know anyone at the Herald Tribune? No. But Donnie George, he knows everybody. Good. Michael, will you call him for me, before I change my mind, please? Yeah. Thank you. If that's what you want. Mmm hmm, that's what I want. You sure you wanna do this? You wanna open this all up again? We know what these guys are capable of. I've been scared for a long time. But I didn't wanna face it and now's the time. I need to. Sometimes maybe it's better to be scared and live longer. The only trouble with that is you stay scared. You were thinking about David, weren't you? It's okay. The police have not led me to believe that... But as I previously stated, I'm hoping that the public will be able to come forward with some information possibly so that Mr. Calvin and Marty Vanbeeber can be questioned. Good luck to you and your family, I commend your courage. Hey! Anyone knowing the whereabouts of Marty and Calvin Vanbeeber-- - What the hell are you doing? Should contact his local law enforcement agency. How about we keep that down a little bit. Oh, fuck, watch it. Just throw that jerk out, Wayne. There ain't no reason kicking out anybody, the world's full of degenerates. You got a point there, hun. Yeah... Later, Marty, the lady here and I is talking god damn philosophy. You and me better go home right now! Whoo, boy! Hello? Yeah. Yeah? Mrs. Dietz, please? All right, just a minute. It's for you, Maureen. I'm sorry, I planned a running date with her. Get her something to drink, all right? Hello? Hello, who's this? You should let it die. You wanted us, we're gonna have to show you that the age of chivalry is not dead. You wanted us, honey, we're on our way. Let's see, guess all I'm gonna need now is a couple packs of them Winston's there behind you. I can't sell you that beer on Sunday, man, not in this county. You got a whole cooler full of that beer back there, you best sell me some of it. Hey Calvin, man, he says he can't sell you no beer. Let's just go on down the road. Hey, the man's job is to sell groceries. Ain't that what the sign says? First of all, you don't tell me what my job is. Now you go down there, about three miles down the road, in the other county, and get some beer. You get on out of here with all that, man. Hey, you listen to me! You're gonna sell me some of that beer or I'm gonna take this entire counter and put it up your black ass. Yeah, right! Ben, get on outta here, shake your ass. Ben, better be 60 of ya'll back there. Come on out here, Ben. Back off! Hey Marty, let's kick some ass. Get your white trash asses out of here! Now! About 15 seconds, cops gonna be all over this place. Hey, who the hell you trying to kid? Won't no cops come in 15 miles of this place. You're just lucky the old fart there's got a gun or my boot would be so far up your ass, your breath will smell like shit and balls. Now, ya'll remember that, you here. And next time, be nice to customers. Well that was worth it but I truly would've liked to stomp that boy once or twice. You see that old fart with a gun? So, you called her? Mmm hmm. What'd she say? Oh, she's dying to see us. It was his voice. You were on television, our phone is listed. I mean, any freak could've picked up the phone book or dialed information and called just to give you a scare. Sick. I know it's sick but it can get sick, let me tell you. If it was, then why would they reach out and say hi before they came? So what happens if I call the police again? Well, you'll get sympathy. But not much more. Freeze! It's okay. Thank you, Ernie. Can I go now? Sorry, no it's okay, it's police business. How about turn it down back there, Calvin? I like it. I said turn it down! Up all the time playing with yourself back there and listening to that noise. I ain't playing with myself and it ain't noise. Don't need to play with myself the way you do, Martin. I ain't got no trouble picking up fine ladies. ...got a plate for it here and there either. Won't you just shut up, Cal. I'm over your shit, you hear me, just shut up! Man, I'm fine back here, let's stop for a beer. Oh, we gonna hit a station, we'll get some gas and you can have a Dr. Pepper and that's it. We're on a mission here, Cal. You mind what I'm saying, you hear me. Well I ain't deaf. Hey, there's a station right there. Hey, how scared was she on the phone? Oh, she's scared all right. Not turning back and neither are we. Mom? What? I know you're not supposed to disturb you when you're working but-- That's right, honey. She says it's important. Well, tell them I have to call them back later. It's the cop, Helen. Thanks. Hello, Helen? Hey, you okay? Yeah, what's up? Something, maybe nothing, I'm not sure. You found them. No. Do you remember the witness named Franz Halmer? The one you met in the pizza place? Yes, I remember him. Well, Halmer is dead. Dead? Garbage collectors found him in an alley this morning. See, I wouldn't have made the connection, if, well, if, you know-- If what? Well, it could be a coincidence. This place isn't the same as it used to be. We haven't had time to trace all these connections, so-- Helen, just please come out and say it. Well, he was beaten to death. It will be in the newspapers. I don't think the TV or papers will make the connection between Halmer and you. But well-- I've got him killed. I went on television, I talked to the newspapers. Hey, before you take it on, let the police find out if maybe it was a robbery or someone he knew. Look, I'll find out what I can and get back to you. All right. There's one more thing. Go on. Halmer wasn't here on business, he was staying with another witness, Ms. Breen. She was working at Bittie's that night. She was having an affair with Halmer. Really, Susan Breen. She's program director at Channel 62. Now Helen, what if Susan-- Well, she's being watched by the police and I pulled a few strings and got myself temporarily deputized. I'll just keep an eye on you both, just in case. They're back. They're back, Helen. Barry, don't... This is crazy. Why should we be the ones that are hiding? They should be the ones that are hiding. I know. Look, this wasn't my idea, pal. Your mom is going through kind of a rough time, now, so just bare with her. She just wants to see that you're safe. Somebody's gotta be with me to protect me in case they come! Who's coming? The carpet cleaners. And Mike's gonna take us out for pizza every night. Every night! That's right. Where's your bear, honey? Just trying to help. Here's my little bear. Okay. How can I stay with a guy who can out pig me on pizza? Hey man, I'm going on a diet. Your mother's working it out for me. I'm supposed to eat three, five groupers and a chocolate malt four times a day. Mom! Look Barry, I'm going to be all right, okay? I can't just hide. I've got my classes and I've got to shoot the video tomorrow and Helen's gonna be staying with me. Oh great, maybe this time he'll shoot her. And we'll never get the paper again. I'm gonna see you in about-- Two days. Maybe three. Two! Go with your brother. Come on. You know, I don't know if this is the best idea we've ever had. Mmm, look, I'll call you later, all right? All right. Sure but you know, when this is over, I think we should sit down and have a serious talk about us in the future. I mean, I don't know if I can go on being the happy teddy bear much longer. Well, I'll give it some serious thought. All right, all right. I'll see you later. Call you later. Okay, let's go! Can I help you, ma'am? I have a 3:00 appointment with Susan Breen. I'll tell her you're here. Your 3:00 appointment is here, Ms. Breen. All right. She'll be down in a second. Thank you. Can I help you, ma'am? Let me catch my fucking breath. Okay, I have an appointment. I'm meeting Clyde Dunigan. Dunigan. He works here, he's my cousin. Mmm, no Dunigan. Hey John, what's up? Listen, do you have a Dunigan working up there? What, no, Dunigan. All right, thanks anyway. Nothing even close, are you sure? He's my fucking cousin. Well, there's no Dunigan on the Channel 62 roster. 62, ah shit. That asshole at the gas station told me this was Star Cable. Listen, I'll be very happy to tell you the way to the cable office if you hold your voice down, control your language, and step outside. Just fucking forget it. Sorry about that. Mrs. Dietz? Yes. Susan. Hello. You look different. I was just thinking the same about you. Let's go to the cafeteria where we can talk. I've only got a few minutes. Hey, Tony. Oh, about a year ago, I saw that you were taping a show, I came to watch. I stayed in the booth. I didn't say hi. I didn't wanna remind you of the past. Cream? Thank you. There you go, thanks, Tony. I appreciate you taking this time to talk with me. I know you're very busy. I'm not sure how to put this. First, I'm very sorry about what happened to Mr. Halmer. I'm sorry, too. Let me clear something up. Franz and I were through years ago. When we met, he was lots of things to me, older, better educated, good looking guy. He hung around Bittie's, even brought his wife. I was a kid. I haven't been a kid for a long time. I can see that. Franz came down here to get something going. I let him stay overnight. I didn't let him in my bed. That doesn't mean I didn't cry for him when I heard what happened. Oh, it didn't sound that way, Susan. You know, the police don't know who killed... Who killed him. Muggers, robbers, whatever they call them. It doesn't really make a difference. Well, it could be the men who killed my husband. They may be looking for the witnesses. Me? You and me. Any of the others. I know that it might not seem to make sense but I hope that you can understand my concern. Wait a minute, what you're suggesting is that those two maniacs are coming to kill all the witnesses of the murder? That doesn't make sense, how did they find Franz? Those two weren't exactly think tank material. Oh my god, do you think they saw him coming out of my apartment? Yes, I think they can find you. I don't mean to frighten you, Susan? I believe that the police are watching out for you. But is there a friend that you can stay with for a while? Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening. Can you come to my place tonight? Well, I'm not sure. Come on, you just scared the hell out of me. You've gotta come just for some coffee or something? What time? 8:30. Yeah, all right, I'll be there. You two mind telling me what the fuck that was all about? Hey, there it is. I see it. What the hell are we doing in Tampa, for Christ sake? ...memories. Yeah, we're very nostalgic. Where we going now? Get out. Out, you dumping me in this crummy neighborhood? You know what the hell can happen to me here? Who are we? Who are, you're fucking nuts is who you are! I don't know. We ain't nothing, are we? Huh, you never met us before now, have you? I never met you guys. That's good. Get on out, go! Hey, now you just stand there looking lucky. I don't wanna see you giving us that finger now. Martin here is very sensitive. Shoo, shoo, shoo, get on out! I'm truly gonna miss her. I doubt that. Susan? Get out of here, find a phone, dial 9-1-1 and tell them to get here fast. Move! Get back, get out! Susan! Get to the phone. We must've just missed whoever did this. Are you gonna be sick? Because if you're gonna be sick or go nuts on me, get out. I'll call. Hey, anybody home? The grocery man. Hello, tried to call you earlier. Oh, well we were out most of the night. Hello, Helen. Have an orange. Thanks, Mike. Where are my children, Mike? Don't worry, they're at my house watching a video with five linemen. So, how's Susan Breen? Well, she's alive, comatose, she may not make it. What do the police say? Well, the locals still won't tie to the Vanbeebers. I got an appointment, I gotta go. See you later tonight. Where you going? Oh, I've got some business to take care of. Two out of the six witnesses to David's murder have been attacked in the last two days. I don't know. Hey, let me go with you, wait a minute! No, I started this alone, Mike. Don't bother, she's not listening. Yeah, you don't have to finish it alone! I wanna finish it alone. Calm down, Coach, now listen. You have more important things to worry about right now. Huh, what? Well, Maureen said that there was six witnesses to her husband's murder, she was wrong, there were nine. She forgot about herself, - Yeah, yeah. Barry and Nancy. They were just kids! Nancy was a baby, for Christ sakes. Well, you ready Barelli's file. The Vanbeeber's are out there. Don't expect them to be making very much sense. Roll up the window. Hey guys, now don't need trouble, just please don't do that. Nice car you got here, Buddy. Help! Help! Mr. Burnham, I'm sorry that I'm late. Hello, Maureen. Dan Burnham and don't you give it a thought. Realtors are used to it. And you ought to wear your coat. I gotta tell you that nobody's lived here for almost five years. I have Al Swingo's boy come over every other week, take care of the grass, but for what I pay him, you can't expect the governor's mansion in Tallahassee. No, you can't. Shall we take a look? Yes. I believe the interior's gonna give you a little bit of a surprise. I left it just the way it was when they left. Marty always liked things real neat. Cal and Marty left all of a sudden about five years back, after a little trouble with Bay Williams down at the 175 Tavern. They left without leaving any instructions. Let's have a look upstairs. You can check out that living room on the way back. Oh, the neighborhood's not what it used to be, no use taking any chances. Shall we go? That's James Vanbeeber, that's Cal and Marty's grandfather. It's been said he was less than a savory gentleman. This Cal and Marty, they own the house? No, no, I reckon I do by default. See, Cal and Marty are my first cousins, Mrs. Dietz. I didn't tell you my last name. You didn't have to. I saw you on television. Yeah, we get television even out here. That policeman that you mentioned on the show, that Barelli, I remember when he came out here. He walked around, just like we're doing. Cal and Marty's bedrooms are right at the top of the stairs and there's a loft. I've seen enough, thank you. No, I don't think you have. No, I think you ought to see their room. Really it's not necessary. No, you came out to see the house, Mrs. Dietz, now you should see their room. Mr. Burnham? I'm gonna show you their room. Right up here. Marty and Cal's rooms are right over here. Nobody ever knew why they slept in the same room when there was two bedrooms. My cousin's rooms. Cal and Marty are my closest living relatives. And I wish to god they were dead and buried. And burning in hell. I'm sorry, Mr. Burnham. No reason for you to be sorry. I'm the one that's sorry. Sorry for what they did to your husband and god knows how many others. But you're not responsible for what they did. Mrs. Dietz, I saw that look in your eyes a few minutes back. You were ready to turn and run from me. I was one of them, as far as you was concerned. I've had that most of my life in this town. Why didn't you move somewhere else? I'd carry them with me no matter where I go. Know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Mrs. Dietz, would you join me for lunch at The Paradise before you leave? No, thank you. I really have to get back. Come in, come on in. You know who I am? I'm not likely to ever forget you or that night, Mrs. Dietz. Would you like a coke, a hot dog, or something? A water, thank you. Mrs. Dietz, you all right? I'm all right. How are the kids? They're fine. Good, good. You know, a thing like that can kind of stay with a person. Your little boy, I haven't seen a look like that on a child in my life. And when I read about you going into the hospital, I just... You mind if I talk about it? No. Well, the thing is, I thought the boy would have to go in too. I'm so glad they came out of it. I came to warn you-- I know, I know, it was in the papers today. I think I saw those two yesterday. You know, my eyes don't cooperate as much as they used to, but then there isn't as much I wanna see. Now, Mr. Halmer and Susan Breen-- Yes, I know, I know. I know. Ooh-ie, I haven't thought about Susie in years until today. You know, she quit right after it happened. I didn't know what happened to her. See, I brought these two back by talking to the media. Yes, I suspect so. But figure it this way, if you hadn't, they might be mold in somewhere, live to be old men. See, they're running scared now. You, you want a gun? No. I run very fast. Well. Maybe it's time to stop running. Now you come to warn me and I appreciate that. But you see, I'm easy for them to find and they know the way. Hell, I'm in here most hours and I live out back. But I got a shotgun behind that counter and it makes a big path, so I don't have to see so good. But you know, in a way, I'm hoping to see those two. Don't get me wrong, I'm scared. But I'm ready. Here's my number, if you hear anything-- I'll call. Thank you, and I'll call you if I hear anything. Now, you take care of yourself. Goodnight. Freeze! If I were you. What's that? Oh, bless her Barbie. So what's the reason for the quick draw? Susan? No, no, she's still in a coma. It's Gats. Gats? The old man, the one that was at Bittie's that night. He's got this high rise in Saint Pete, and he was home at night. Somebody came to the front door, they knocked. The old man opened up. He was practically blind, but he could see some guy standing there with a bat or a club or something. And the guy stared at him for a few seconds, and then he turned and he walked away. So I thought that maybe-- Another witness. When are the police gonna finally make a connection? I think we got their attention this time. Well, it's about time. Oh, Barry, he, he came home. Yeah? He's really worried about you. Well I'll go talk to him. Helen? I'd really appreciate if you'd stay here tonight with Barry rather than come to my class with me. Oh no, no, I'll just call Mike. I don't want you to be alone out there. Okay. Foot, Cal. Well, excuse the shit out of me, dear Abby. Cheap piece of Taiwanese shit needs a piece of wire. I think I'm gonna cut one off that lamp. You just make sure the lamp works when you're done with it now. What the hell'd you do? The TV's. God damn it. Come on! Best be careful you don't break that expensive piece of shit. Then you'll have something else to fix now, won't you? Damn. Hey, where's my smokes at anyway? Oh, come on, Cal. How about not getting pieces of wire and shit all over the floor again. Are you happy now? Look here, what I've got figured, we're gonna get her today. If not today, tomorrow. But either way, she's gonna be ours. Yeah, maybe we can get that nigger with a knife. Come on now, what I tell you about all that anti-racial shit, huh? We've got to give that up. Them times are over with, boy. Look here, somebody hurts us, now we just beat the shit out of them regardless of the race, color, or creed, right? Right? Oh, man. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'd be a lot better if you were at Mike's. You spent most of your life looking at me like that. I'm not gonna crack up again, and I'm not gonna go away and leave you. I'm gonna be all right. You have to let me be a little frightened and angry when reasonable. Like Princess Daisy always says, mommy loves Bach and Barry loves rock. I don't think I got a real answer a minute ago. Are you okay? Mmm hmm, I'm okay. You? Hell no. Do you think about that night a lot? After the last few days, yeah. And you? Some. It never was very clear to me. It's more like something that somebody told me more than something that happened. You know what I mean? You were so young. Maybe it's better that way. Maybe. Did we talk about this when you came home from the hospital or did I make that up? No, you didn't make it up. Yes, we talked about it. Not a lot but we talked about it. You wanna talk later tonight after class? No. I'll listen. No. You sure? I guess I better get some sleep. Well, if you need me, you know where I'll be. Yeah, at the Y. Mike will be at his house. Please do me a favor, please. I'll go back to big Mike's tonight. I just wish you'd give me a chance to help. You just did, sweetheart. I love you. Mrs. Dietz, what are you doing here? Chico canceled your class, our class is tonight. The air conditioner went out. Really? Can we use the pool? Oh, forget about the pool, I don't swim, remember? But I do sweat. Have you got a sauna? Yeah, but there's no one down there and I'm... Mrs. Dietz, you know how to lock up? I do, thanks, Larry. Thanks, guy. Ain't no matter what kind of bag you've been in your life, there are gonna be days where you feel god is out to do you a favor. Cal? Hey, you seen my bro... Hey, man, you seen my brother? It's a little guy about this tall, he's got a bum leg on him? Yeah, I seen him, he followed these two ladies into the pool. Here we are. You got your way, baby. Another prayer answered. Marty? Oh yeah, Marty. Keep coming, little brother, we got her. Yeah, we got her now. Calvin? I see you. Oh, I see you and you are dead! Calvin was my brother, he's my family. You know what that means? David. My husband's name was David. A man you killed eight years ago! And a name too, it was David! Yeah, I'm coming up after you. You wanted me, well I'm coming! Gonna teach you to be careful what you wish for! Freeze! Drop the tire iron and do a pushup or you're puppy chow. Mo, are you there? Are you all right? I said kiss the floor! Fucking bitch! Fucking! Mike, I pushed him. Wait a minute, let me get this straight. Cal Vanbeeber is dead and Helen shot the other one? How is Helen, is she hurt? No, she's gonna be all right. She just broke her leg very badly. Damn. Well, how are you? I'm all right. Michael, they haven't found him yet. The police thinks he's somewhere in the Y, around the area. And, um... Well, they've also asked me for Barelli's file. Michael, I don't wanna be alone until they find him. How are the children? They're good. Listen, I don't have a car. Barry took mine to go to the movie with Joe Duggar. And Nancy, she's staying with Mrs. Wilson. So you'll have to pick me up. Yes, I'll be there in about 15 minutes. I still can't find the file. Check Barry's room. Damn, somebody left the TV on. Who the hell are you? Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk this over. All I wanna know is where's the bitch? Who are you? I said, where's the bitch? I got it, Mike, let's go. Mike! Mike! How are you? Long time, no see, huh? Mike? Oh careful... now don't step on him. You don't wanna hurt him, do you? Now you just sit your pretty little ass right there on that couch! Me and Cal, we never went looking for any trouble. We weren't looking for no trouble the night your man bone dust in from of them people. See, men like me and Cal, all we gots our pride. You take that away from us. So you kill people? You think you're worth more than other people. That gives you the right to kill. My husband, Susan Breen, Mr. Halmer, my husband! You son of a bitch! You killed my husband, god damn you! I don't know no Halmer! That you was talking about, I don't know them! You've called me back, you've been calling me back night and day for eight years! You reach me, now you done gone and killed Cal. You got witch's eyes and I need to close them. I'm done talking to you. You're right about that. I remember you. I ain't got no fight with you, old man, you get the hell out of my way. This is between me and her! No, it was just between you and the lady. We were all apart of it. We're born part of it. Can't let it go. Didn't figure you could. No other way. Been waiting on him since you come to see me yesterday. He said he didn't kill any of the witnesses. I heard that. No, but who would? Who would want them dead? I mean... Yeah, you go ahead. Hey Mo, where you going? I'll call the police. How's your head? It's all right. Yeah? Yeah. No, this cannot be happening, it's not. Wait here. Okay. I don't know Halmer! That you was talking about, I don't know them. Let him get it all out, otherwise someday he may blow his tank. I ain't got no fight with you old man. Somebody came to the front door, knocked. Sees some guy standing there with a bat, or a club or something. He was there when they killed my father. He's an asshole, he just stood there while some neanderthal just hit him. What did I do, I just told the truth? I haven't seen a look like that on a child in my life. They're dead. The Vanbeeber's are dead now. It's over. It's not over. They let my father die. They could've helped him, stop, but they let him die, they just stood there while those two guys beat him to death. You didn't help him. You just went crazy, you just, you left me, you left Nancy. I'm sorry. I didn't help him. There wasn't anything that you could do. You were just a child. It's the truth. I read Barelli's notes. You left them out and-- I know. I thought it was bigger, a lot bigger. It's just a little place.
