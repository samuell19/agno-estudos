Too risky, no? Not to worry This thing's not loaded The real deal This thing's dangerous October 15, 2015 Now that it 's cold out, there's a flu epidemic You see lots of people in the streets, wearing masks Our director's wearing one isn't that to hide his boozy breath? Speaking of epidemics, Lemming Syndrome! Scary! Sort of like God's own suicide bomber A virus that makes its victims want to kill themselves... It's like, kill yourself off, damn virus! Already 3 million Japanese dead from Lemming That's the population of Nagoya ...Scary And 8 million dead in the U.S.? That's like Osaka Up to 40% of the world population could get it... Couldn't they come up with a better name than Lemming Syndrome? But no clues what causes it or how it spreads I might already be infected Oh, leave it on, Navi san But this guy's an idiot That's why we like him You think? Seconds, Mizui? At this rate, the human race might be exterminated This is a microscopic image of the virus that reproduced itself on the patient's optic nerve That bundle of cords is the optic nerve Oh! At that instant the patient was exposed to a stimulating image The brain interprets this secretion as a command to self-destruct We haven't yet identified the infection route I'm aware of the "mutated mitochondria" theory but then, it's easy to blame every new rare disease on God's wrath Be that as it may, Doctor, what's the source of that data? Well, I can't... Pressure from the top? That's not the case We, right No doubt, as director of the National Laboratory, you can't afford to comment But surely this must be some sort of bacteriological weapon If we keep mum, the government will attribute the recent boom n suicides to disease, not their own failed policies What's our unemployment rate now? 38%, was it? There's no proof What's that to us, we're not the media Excuse me The media still care about what's detrimental to the government? Maybe a wealthy individual with a conscience would investigate Right, Mr. President? This it, Doctor? Hurry up and remember They say the human memory is boundless, but that's a big lie The walls thicken and rise every year At my age, it's hopeless "Hey, a geisha "costs money to sleep with "My wife, she's free "Sleep with another man's wife "and it's the cops again "Sleep with a virgin, knock her right up "Sleep with a nun..." Those officials tore the place apart the other day, but they found nothing Their hearts weren't in it You're amazing, a genius, a pro Mr. Detective, you cinched it Someday, I knew someone like you would show up Someone who examined what everyone else ignored I like you I'll teach you a German poem Have a seat 10 million Yen! That's garbage Suit yourself (Your attention please) (German-sounding Japanese gibberish) (A pre-war obscene poem ridiculing Fascism) (This line means " C'mon, F**k her" in japanese) (Sorry for his indiscretion!) Welcome Tsuruta san? I'm Kashiwagi Gin and tonic with Bombay What the hell! Mizui from Stepin Fetchit Huh? Where's Mizui, Kashiwagi san? Toss it Outside Wow, not a chance against that... So, they'll come again, today? Sure, when they get hungry About when? I don't know, they're unpredictable You also operate a hostel, here? Yes, but I haven't had any guests in ages Can you put us up for the night? No, not in this filthy place Does she have Lemming Syndrome? Invalids unwelcome... is it? Whatever's wrong with her, I never welcome tied up guests If we untie her, we can stay? Oh, I don't know about that, Natsuishi There are sheer cliffs everywhere, perfect for jumping from Oh, I don't know about that... If someone wants to die, let them What's with this lady? Madam, she happens to be my only grandchild If you can stand this "filthy place," make yourself at home What to do? Well... What do you think, Hana? Natsuishi, please untie her Right So, care for something to eat? Hello You've got company, Mizui Hello, you're Mizui and Asuhara from Stepin Fetchit, right? Beef stew all right with you? That's great, thanks She's got Lemming Syndrome Asuhara's got it, too Why don't you have symptoms? Is it because of your music? I did enough research to know that you are both world famous musicians I'm ashamed that I wasn't personally aware of you Who knows why they like that noise Aside from that, audiences at your concerts show temporary signs of recovery What does it mean? I see, you don't even know Your so-called noise cures disease Apparently I learned this from that doctor, Miyazawa Most of them are still alive Including Tsuruta san You remember him, your manager? Tsuruta's still alive? Hey, Tsuruta Hey, Asuhara, that's dangerous Won't you please heal my granddaughter? Uesawa Eriko Hey, Tsuruta I'll call you later Hey, long day Give me a lobster Where's Eriko? She went home, exhausted They didn't die of Lemming Syndrome Even if it's only temporary, they're still alive Because of your music Wrong! What's "wrong?" Your noisy music kills the virus, right? Wrong! The sound doesn't kill the virus, the sound feeds it! Die!
