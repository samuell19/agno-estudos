(mellow synth music) (dynamic music) (logo thudding) (hammer tapping) (animal hoots) (hammer tapping) - All right, well, that about does it. - It's all good in here too, man. - Awesome. Hector, I wanna thank you for your help, man. - Ah, of course. - Appreciate you. - Yeah. So you really think you're gonna catch Bigfoot in this thing? - I know I will. Had about a dozen sightings out here. - It's true, amigo. I've seen him myself. - Oh yeah? Well, I think you guys are getting high on your own supply. (Hector laughs) - Hector, why don't you go obtener some cervezas from el campamento before I kick your ass? - You know, your Spanish is getting really good. - I pay attention. - All right, adios. Man, I don't like his shit talking. - Only guy I could get that'd work for dope. - I know, I know. You know, we did it. - You wanted this for a long time. Your pawpaw would be real proud of you. Hey man, fuck Hector. You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? - Hell yeah. - Hell yeah. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) - Ow. Bigfoot trap? (Hector speaking in Spanish) (animal howling) Guys? (animal grunting softly) (footsteps thudding rapidly) Red? (animal grunting) Stop playing, man. I know that's you over there, bro. Fuck, okay. (animal grunting) (animal grunting loudly) (dramatic music) (Hector screams) (fists beating) (Hector screaming) (fists beating) (blood spurting) (fists beating) (Hector groaning) (fists beating) (Hector groaning) (dramatic music continues) - Hi, I'm Josh McMahon with Point Zero Media, and welcome to "The Point," a show where I interview America's strangest citizens. Obama killed Jeffrey Epstein? - Yes. - Waifu is a anime character that you personally adopt as your own wife. - Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, they come right out of this place. They're looking at me like, "What's up, dude?" - Raising a dog is way more important and more expensive than raising a human. - My LLC prints these waifus on body pillows. - I was beating the shit. I beat the shit out of Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, same night! - And you test these out yourself? - Well, why wouldn't I? - What are your... - If you just do your own research and look past all the lies. - Grooming appointments, nails, play dates, anal glands. - I'm sorry, did you say anal glands? - 37, 38, 39. - Can you not count so fucking fast? I'm trying. - 40. I'm counting to how many pushups you do. - Yeah, well, Tinkerbell has a bit of a leakage issue. - Nope, that's not even a pushup. You gotta go all the way up. - Why are you here, are you from Argentina? - I'm a journalist with Point Zero Media. - Oh, okay. With the media, okay. - I'm fucking like, I'm in this. This is my shit, yo. - Hey, people have performance issues all the time. - Get, give me, get! - Get off! - I'm taking this interview! - Because they don't want us to know it's flat. - [Josh] And why not? - Because they wanna control how people perceive the world. - They being the US government? - Every government and every news organization around the globe. - Did you get that? Around the globe? - Yes. - Don't you mean across the plate? Let's wrap out. Oh my God. - The Earth is flat, that is that! The Earth is flat, that is that! (downtempo folk music) - [Josh] Don't you mean across the plate? - God, I can't believe people like this actually exist. - I can't believe they get to vote. (employees laughing) - Hey man, congrats. 4 million views in one weekend. - Thanks, man. Never actually had one blow up like this before. - Jake seemed to love it. - Jake saw it? - He sent it out to the whole company. - Holy shit. (employees chattering) - Yeah, well, that's because we have more lawyers than they do. Yep. Josh, right? - Yeah. - Congrats on the video. - Thanks. Gotta thank the Flat Earth Lady for that too. - God, she was hysterical. And the way you kept egging her on and on. - She was egging herself on. - I showed the CEO and he loved it. He wants to meet you. - For real? - For real. Now, check this out. I found someone for your next video. - Hi, my name's Red Wilson. I'm the founder of the Southern Sasquatch Research Foundation, and I have created the world's second freestanding Sasquatch Trap. I've been searching for Sasquatch-- - Oh, I like him already. - Just wait. - I've had a few sightings of a medium-sized female in the area, and I intend on catching her. I'm looking for an accredited news organization to come and cover this incredible discovery. It's been my pa... (laptop lid slaps) - Amazing, I'll set up the interview. - I don't want an interview. I want you to take him up on his offer. - You want me to film him catching Bigfoot? - No, I want you to film him not catching Bigfoot and realizing he's a big fucking idiot. - These people, they're not idiots. They're just misinformed. - To-may-to, to-ma-to. The guy's just outside the Smoky Mountains in East Tennessee. That is for going viral. - I don't know what to say. - Nothing to say. Now go make another. (somber guitar music) - [Josh] So I'll go camping with him and document his big discovery. - Isn't that kind of mean? - He's the one that wanted the press. - You know, he's gonna make a fool of himself. - No. Maybe we find Bigfoot. (chuckles) Look, I do interviews like this all the time. How's this any different? - What about that autism piece you were working on? - Nobody wants to buy that. - [Steph] But it's important. - These sites, they don't want important. They want clicks. - I just remember when you wanted to do that kind of work. - I still do, but I gotta start somewhere. Before this, the show was barely doing 100,000 an episode. Now the CEO wants to meet me. - I know, and I'm proud of you. Just go easy on the guy, okay? - Scouts honor.

Now, the way I see it, either one of two things is gonna happen. Either, one, we find Bigfoot, or, two, he makes a complete ass of himself. - [Red] Howdy, stranger. - Hey, Josh McMahon, Point Zero Media. - Red Wilson, Southern Sasquatch Research Foundation. Hope I didn't interrupt your filming none. - No, just testing out the camera. - Right. All right, well, join me when you're ready. - [Josh] Yeah. (footsteps thudding) - Welcome to the SSRF headquarters. This here's my best friend, Kyle. - You from Nashville? - Not originally, moved there for work. - Yeah, you and everyone fuckin' else. - Kyle, be nice. - Relax, I ain't gonna do nothin'. - Nice tattoo. - Eh? Resemblance is uncanny, huh? May be the last thing Hector seen. - [Josh] Hector? - Yeah, he's a friend of ours that went missing a while back. - [Kyle] Pretty sure a squatch got him. - Pretty sure? - He went back to camp and we bailed on him. Come back next day, camp's tore up. He ain't there. - Yeah, I spoke about it at a Bigfoot convention a while back. You can look it up. - (chuckles) They got Bigfoot conventions? - Yeah. Actually, that's where I sell these. - That pretty lucrative? - Nah, not really, but I make enough to get by. Plus I get a speaking fee. - Oh hell, I ain't get paid shit. - Sounds like finding Bigfoot is in your best financial interest. - It ain't about making money, man. It's about proving that Sasquatch is real. Plus, I'm sick of folks making fun of us. - Yeah. If he wanted money, he'd sell drugs. - You know, I googled you. - Yeah? - Yeah, I really liked that article you did on art therapy for veterans. - Oh yeah, I did that in school. - Yeah? My daddy was a vet. He would have liked it. - I'm honored. Yeah, I wish I did more stuff like that. - Well, man, now here's your chance. We got a hell of a story here. I'm glad you're on it with me. Here. (can pops) Dear Lord Jesus, we pray that we be straightforward like the sky-reaching tree, that our souls be clear like spring water, and that you be our constant companion on this trip, and that the squatches be ever plentiful.

He and I used to be obsessed with this documentary called "The Bigfoot Tape." Used to take me squatching all the time, which was really just fun camping trips. It was a way of escaping. You know, home life was rough. Well, that Bigfoot tape turned out to be a hoax. - You know, a lot of people watching are gonna think what you're doing is a hoax. - But see, I got proof. - So many years, you think we'd already have proof. I mean, where's all the evidence? We don't even know where Bigfoot lives or sleeps. - You really asking? Bigfoot sleeps in burrows, kind of like big holes, dens. I've never seen one myself, but much like God himself, just 'cause you don't see him, don't mean he ain't there. - I'm a journalist. I can't believe it without seeing it. - Well, I guess hell's full of journalists. - (laughs) Touche, Red.

What's, what's that for? - Shooting bait, scaring bears, protection. You want one? - No, I'm not really comfortable around guns. - To be honest, we're a little too comfortable with guns around here. Don't tell Kyle I said that. (truck door bangs) All right, let's go. (leaves crunching) (distant banging) (stick clapping) (distant banging) Did you catch that on tape? - Nah, I missed it. - Then you missed something rare. They're hardly out during the day. - That was Bigfoot? - Sure was. They use knocks to communicate their location to each other. - You sure it wasn't a squirrel telling a knock, knock joke? - Good one. (tense music) Welcome to the only Sasquatch trap south of the Mason-Dixon line. I brought a bunch of bait up this morning. - I always thought Bigfoot lived in the PNW. - You keep talking like there's only one. It's a whole species. Australia, they got Yowies. Nepal, they got Yetis. And here, we got Sasquatch. (tense music continues) (Josh chuckles) This here's a trip wire. That way when she comes to get the bait... (bars slam) She keeps eating bait out of here, but I only had the trip wire put in last week. - How do you know it was her? (tongue clicking) - Check it out. It's pretty cool, huh? (tool clicks) (bars scrape) (flame crackling) - Wow, that's... - [Red] It's convincing. I don't know why you need any more proof than that. - Thanks for setting up the tents. - Oh man, no sweat. (can pops) You know, I figure we got about two days to catch her. - What if we don't? - Well, then you'll bully me like you did that Flat Earth Lady. - All right, about that video so-- - Hey man, look, I know you wouldn't do that to me. I told you I googled you. (insects chirping) (device rings) All right, we need to stay quiet. - What are you doing? Are you playing it a lullaby? (chuckles) (creature roaring) - Shh, listen. (distant roaring) That's her. (chuckles) - Kind of sounds like a, like a hillbilly mating call. (Josh chuckles) - Turn the camera off. - Wait, I thought you wanted me to... Dude, what are you doing? Give me the fucking-- - Shh! Why did you come here? - Man, my boss sent me here. - To do what? - To take you up on your offer. - Then take me up on my offer, man. All right, you're a journalist, not a goddamn comedian. All right, you do it. I want you to show the world that I ain't playing tricks. Right? (tense music) (rocks clap) (distant clapping) She's this way here, come on. Let's go, let's go, come on. (tense music continues) (footsteps thudding) (sighs) That's her, man. Look at that, one, two, three, four, five. You see that? - That actually kinda looks fresh. - Hell yeah, it does. - Someone must have planted it though, right? - What the heck? What do you mean someone planted it? Look at this, there's no way that someone... (distant roaring) (tree crashing) Oh, shit, man. We gotta go. - What was that? - Sometimes they fell trees. It's a scare tactic when they get territorial. We gotta go now. - Are we in any danger? - We're not in danger, but we need to stay quiet, and we need to get back to camp now. - [Josh] Okay, let me just finish getting this. - No, no, come on. We gotta now, right now. Come on, let's go. (distant roaring) (tree trunk crashing) (footsteps thudding) - All right, day two. I checked the trap before Red woke up. To make sure he didn't mess with it. It's all still there. Trip wire was still set. I leave tomorrow morning, so today's gonna be big. There was definitely something out there last night, but someone must have planted the print, right? - Hey, I'm gonna go shoot some fresh bait. You all good here? - Yeah, just working on the video. - Right? While I'm gone, can you clean the trap? - She didn't take any of the bait? - I think we scared her off last night. - Hey, about last night, I... - Quite the show, wasn't it? (laughs) (foreboding music) - What's up, big man? - Yo. - You get some good footage? - Yep, but he ain't buying it. - That don't surprise me. - Yeah. - Well, what you thinking? - Let's hold off. No, I'll give you a call if we don't catch anything good on tape by tonight. - All right, fair enough. - Yeah. - I thought, that ought to work. - God bless. Man, I couldn't shoot shit this morning. - Hey, you always been a shit shot, ain't you? - [Red] Shut up. - And on the house. - Man, I told you I don't do that no more. - You gonna need the confidence if you gonna be on TV. - Get rid of it. God knows you don't need any more of it. - Fine. Happy squatching. (Josh wretches) Come on. (mellow guitar music) (Josh grunts) (mellow guitar music continues) (phone rings) (ringtone rings) - Hey baby, how's the trip? - Well, I just cleaned a whole bunch of rotten fruit from a Bigfoot trap, so. - [Steph] Say no more. What's he like? - You know, I actually think he kind of believes in all this stuff. You know, I'm supposed to make this video funny, but I think I'm starting to feel bad. - Well, maybe you should change your approach. - Yeah, but you know, Tiggs is actually counting on something funny, so. - Babe, remember it's just a video. - Right, yeah. We just, we really need this, you know? - [Steph] I know, I'm proud of you, really. - Steph? - Great story. Josh? - Hey, I'm losing you, okay? - [Steph] Josh? - I'll be home tomorrow. (hammer bangs) That's a lot of meat. - Ah, yeah, Kyle brought it. I couldn't kill nothing. - Shouldn't you put that at the trap? - I figure we'd leave a trail of breadcrumbs up to the trap for her. - Through our campsite? Isn't that kind of dangerous? - Well, not if Bigfoot ain't real, it ain't dangerous. - All right, look, I... I'm sorry if I've been rude, I just.... - No, hey, look, listen, don't worry about it. I understand. You're the journalist and I'm the Bigfoot nut. - Ah, look, I wouldn't say that, I'm just-- - Look man, you're getting a squatch on camera tonight, no matter what. I promise. (hammer bangs) (meat thuds) Man, thanks for coming out. I needed a break from that city boy. - Yeah. - Why can't you just stay out here with us? - He smells like Nashville. - (laughs) That's true. Man, I saw him putting cologne on in the woods. - How about that? - Man, I don't know what I'd do without you. - You'd be all right. (chuckles) - (sighs) All right, another night. I've been debating a lot with myself about what I'm doing here and how to approach this. Got me thinking a lot about the Flat Earth Lady. Come to think about it, I, I don't even know her name. (water sloshes) Shit. I need more water. (distant roaring) Fuck was that? (suspenseful music) (soft growling) (footsteps thudding) Who's there? (suspenseful music) (soft growling) (mouth smacking) (suspenseful music continues) (mouth smacking) (soft growling) (creature grunting) (Josh gasping) (footsteps thudding) (creature growling) (ominous music) (creature grunting) (Josh gasping) (creature grunts) (ominous music continues) (creature grunts) (ominous music continues) (creature grunts) (Josh gasps) (gunshots blasting) (creature grunting) - [Red] You're safe to come out now. (zipper clattering) - Did you kill it? - [Red] Nah, man, she wasn't being aggressive. I just scared her off. - There was a Sasquatch right here and you didn't shoot it. - They're sacred animals. I ain't gonna hurt one that's not trying to hurt me. - The body of a fuckin' Sasquatch would've changed the world! - So you believe it? - Believe what? - That what you just saw was a Sasquatch. - I, I mean, I don't know. It could have been a black bear. - A black? Jesus, there ain't no winning with you people. - Look, bears are common in this area. - Well, did you at least get it on video? - A little, but it's dark and blurry. - All right. You had an encounter with something you don't understand. So go back to bed, watch the video. I guaran-damn-tee you that wasn't no bear. - Wow, unbelievable. (footsteps thudding) (crickets chirping) (nose sniffs) Smells like a sewer in here. - Yeah, that's common. They call 'em skunk apes down in Florida. Looks like she stepped clean over that wire. - So it ate all the bait, stepped over the wire. Just kept walking? It's kind of convenient. - What else could it be? Ain't no black bear big enough to step over that wire. - How do you know? (hand taps) - There she is. (hand taps) - So what now? - Nothin'. I mean, you've had as close an encounter as I've ever had. And didn't you get that footage last night? I mean, between that and the thermal-- - Mine's blurry. It still looks like a bear on its hind legs. - Looks like a? You fucking kidding me? What about the thermal? - Dude, how do I know it wasn't some guy in a costume? Or you? - Fine, pack your things. I'm gonna go clean the trap. (crickets chirping) He thought it was a bear, a goddamn black bear. - That's a tall fuckin' bear. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, he ain't gonna believe it until he shakes hands with the damn thing. God. - I can make that happen. - Good. I figure, be down there in about 15 minutes. - All right. Got any special requests? Want me to do a little dance? - Be serious, man, he's gonna have you on camera. - (chuckles) You think he's gonna buy it? - Man, we don't got another choice. - I mean, you can let him go. - Man, I don't want him mocking me in front of the whole world. - All right, all right. I'll do it. - All right. Keep your shit together. - I'm good, I got my shit. Got my shit. (Kyle clears throat) Shit, yeah. Oh, that's good. Shit, yeah, man. - You ready? - Yeah. Hey, sorry for how everything turned out. - Yeah, well, I can't force you to believe something. - I can tell this means a lot to you though. - Yeah. Well, it was dumb to think that I could trap a squatch in two days. - Look, people can decide for themselves, all right? I'll be honest in the video. - I'm sure you will. - Hey, you got any extra water? Ran out. (distant banging) - Get your camera. - What are you seeing? - Look, look, it's her. (suspenseful music) - Is that a bear? - That's her. (footsteps thudding) - I thought you said they didn't come out during the day. - I said it was rare. All right, stay very still, or she might charge. (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful music continues) - We should run. - No, no, no, just keep filming. (footsteps thudding) - We need to run. - We're fine. Keep the camera steady. (creature grunting softly) - Maybe she doesn't see us. (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps thudding) - No! (rifle blasting) (Josh groans) Shit, Kyle. - Kyle. Oh, shit. - Oh, God, fuck. What the hell, man? I told you to stay back! - I was fuckin' around. I didn't think he'd really buy it. (groans) - You shot him, what the hell? (Josh panting) - [Josh] Wait, wait. - You mother fucker, you shot him! - Don't do something you're gonna regret, okay? - You fuckin' shot him! - Don't do anything, please don't! - Goddamn it! - Don't do it! Please, please, don't do it, don't do it, don't shoot! (rifle butts) (Red grunts) (suspenseful music) (footsteps thudding) (bars slam) - Oh my God, Kyle, man. Are you coked out? - I needed this for my confidence. I was gonna be on TV. - (laughs) Man, I told you not to fuck this up. What were you doing? - This shit costume. I just wanted to scare him, Red. - It is a shit costume, man. You look like shit. Man, come on, we gotta get you up. Come on, come on. We gotta get you to the car. Come on. We gotta fix this. (suspenseful music continues) - Hey, Red! - Just gotta get to the car. - Yep. - All right? - Yep. - We're gonna make it. - [Kyle] Yep. - All right, just, the car's right there. - Yeah, I see it. - Come on, man. - Red, let me out! (fist bangs) It was an accident! - We're gonna make it, don't you worry. All right, just get in the truck. - Yeah. - Come on. All the way, all the way. Come on, let's do it. Come on, come on. (car door slams) (suspenseful music continues) All right, I got you. We're gonna make it, man. We're gonna make it. Man, you with me, Kyle? Okay, all right, come on, Kyle. - Red. - What is it, man, what? - You a good friend, Red. - You're a good friend. You're the best friend in the world, man. We're gonna make it, okay? Come on. (truck engine revs) Oh God, come on, truck. Kyle? Kyle? Kyle! God. Come on, wake up, man. Wake up. Come on, man. You're not dying on me. Come on. Man, you with me? (Red grunts) Come on, Kyle, Kyle, you with me? No, don't do this! Don't, no, don't! Oh God, oh please, God, please! (Red screams) - Oh, no. (footsteps thudding) (footsteps thudding) (crickets chirping) (footsteps thudding) Red, there you are. Whoa, take, take it easy. - He's dead. (melancholy music) - I'm so sorry. - Put your fuckin' hands up! - It was an accident, okay? - You meant to shoot him. - I didn't know it was a person. Please don't shoot. - An eye for an eye. Ain't that what they say? - Please don't shoot. (suspenseful music) (Josh panting) (Josh panting) - This is bad. - Please, just let me out. - I can't do that. I let you go, and you'll tell everyone I'm a psycho. I locked you up and kidnapped you. It'll kill the SSRF, which is my only source of income. And you'll get away with the murder of my only friend on the grounds of self-defense. I'll get thrown in jail for kidnapping. I'll become a laughing stock. - I'll do whatever you want me to do. - You're only saying that 'cause I got a gun. - They're not gonna let me go on self-defense because I thought I saw Bigfoot. Believe me, all right? I don't want anyone else to know about this either. - I don't know what I was thinking. - I swear on my life, all right? Let me out, I'm not gonna tell a soul. - Well, let's say you're being honest. How can I trust you? Will I just believe that you're gonna keep quiet forever? And the longer I keep you in there, the more trouble I get into legally speaking, especially after that whole Hector thing. All right, let's figure this out. How are we gonna get out of this? - People will realize I'm missing. They know where I am. - They know where my cabin is. I managed to keep the location of the trap a secret, even during the Hector investigation. - They'll send a search party. - You'll die of thirst before they ever find you. I don't want to kill you, but I might just let God do it. - Okay. Variables aside, what's the perfect outcome look like for you? (tense music) - Well, ideally we would've caught a squatch. Second place being that, assuming Kyle's shit costume fooled you, you'd have gone back with some decent video. You convince enough people, I could sell more shirts, could have built more traps, and then eventually caught the real thing. Maybe even have you back out here to film it. - Okay. But with your friend gone and-- - Kyle. - With Kyle gone and me in this trap, what's your ideal scenario? - There ain't no ideal scenario. - I'll tell you mine, all right? You let me out of here. We contact Kyle's family. - Kyle was a junkie and a dealer with no family or friends except me. He wasn't like Hector. Hector had a wife who went looking for him immediately. Only people gonna notice Kyle's gone are other junkies. We ain't gotta tell no one. - Great, let's avoid the hassle. I'm telling you, they're not gonna let me off the hook because I thought I saw Bigfoot. - Wait a minute, proof. We got proof of you shooting Kyle. You could take the footage you have and make a movie out of it like the one that pawpaw and I used to watch. And I could let you go, and I won't tell the cops that you shot Kyle. And then you can take that footage and make it look like a convincing encounter. Win-win. And as for the proof of me locking you up. (rifle blasts) Well, we ain't got proof of that, do we? - Deal. Bring me my backpack, I'll edit the video. (rifle clanks) - Well, that's about as good a deal as any. I'll be back. (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (Josh grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (Josh grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (Josh grunting) (laptop lid claps) (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps thudding) (Josh grunts) (suspenseful music continues) - [Josh] Oh, shit. - Hey. Is this what you're looking for? - Perfect. - Found the video of you shooting Kyle. Deleted it off the memory card and put it on this flash drive. When you're done with the video, we'll put it on here and destroy the computer. So don't try anything. - Where are you going? - To a funeral. (insects chirping) (phone beeps) - This morning something went horribly wrong. A man is dead. And now Red Wilson is holding me hostage. (shovel thuds) (shovel clanks) (pickax thuds) (somber music) (Red grunts) (cigarette pack smacks) (bag rustles) (Red whimpers softly) (mournful music) - Who would've thought the squatch would've killed you before dealing did? (laughs) You dummy. (mask slaps) (Red sighs) You know, you know growing up was real tough, especially after pawpaw died and Daddy hit rock bottom. But man, you made it better. You... Hey, sure you had your issues. But I didn't mind. You were the only one that would listen to me. You were all I had, man. You can't be dead. (cries) I love you, bud. God's got you now. And bye. (cries) (tense music) - Signal. Signal. Fuck, signal. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Signal, come on. He's gonna be fuckin' back. Come on, come on, give me a fuckin' signal. Come on, come on, come on. Yes. Yes, okay. (buttons beep) (tense music continues) - [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? - I don't have much time. My name is Josh McMahon, and I'm being held hostage by Red Wilson. (footsteps thud) (tense music continues) We parked a black Ford pickup truck next to some trailers on a gravel road in Sweetwater. And from there, we hiked down a dirt path into the woods. And I'm being locked in when he calls the Bigfoot trap. Hello? Hello? (footsteps thudding) - You know, I used to smoke cigarettes all the time. Now I can't hardly finish one without. (dramatic music) What the fuck are you doing? - [Josh] There's no signal, I was just-- - Hand it over. - I wasn't doing anything. - Give me the phone right now! (boot thuds) (Red grunts) It's exactly what I'm fucking talking about! The minute you don't have a gun in your face, you go back on our deal! - Red, I wasn't doing anything, okay? - Don't you lie to me. Did you or did you not call the cops? - How could I? There's no signal. (tense music continues) (Red grunts) (boot kicks) (keys jangle) (insects chirping) - Well, this changes things, don't it? - It doesn't have to. (rifle cocks) Red, nothing's changed, okay? I can still edit the video. You can watch me send it off. - You call the cops. You don't care if they find out that you shot Kyle? - No, I was just trying to call my girlfriend. I was gonna let her know I was gonna be home late. - Bullshit. - I also filmed a goodbye video in case I didn't make it. - Edit the video. I'll let you know what I decide when you're done. (insects chirping) (tense music) (gravel crunching) (tense music continues) - [Dispatcher] So, what, did you find the guy? - Yeah, I got the black pickup truck. Look, I'm pretty far out here. I think I'm gonna need some backup. - [Dispatcher] Hey man, you're cutting out. You have your satellite phone? - No, my sat phone's dead. I'm never this far out. (broken chattering on radio) Hey, look, I'm gonna go scope it out and check on the guy. Out. - What I saw that night was unexplainable. I came out here expecting a hoax, but I left a believer. What do you think? - I don't know, man. I mean, I've been squatching my whole life. The one time that I try to fake something, this happens. And now Kyle's gone. Pawpaw's gone. (melancholy piano music) Daddy's gone. And I know the moment I let you out of there, you're gonna go make a fool of me just like everyone else does. - Hey, come on. We're gonna figure this out. - No, man, can't you see? This is all I got, all right? I can't lose this too. (melancholy music continues) - Oh, what are you doing, man? - Man, I gotta, I gotta stop crying. I gotta think straight, man. I need, I need a clear head. - [Josh] That's not gonna help you think straight. (nose snorts) Red, stop! - Woo! Okay, all right. Woo, okay. Man, I gotta go think straight. I'll be back. - Red, wait, come on! Red, stop! - I'll be back. Woo! We're gonna figure out a way out of this thing, man. Okay. - Fuck. (tense music) (footsteps thudding) (distant banging) (footsteps thudding) (tense music) (footsteps thudding) - You fucking liar. (Red panting) Okay. Okay. (keys jangling) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down, slow down. - Thank God you're here, officer. You gotta help me, man. He's after me. - Who's after you? - He's got a gun. We gotta go. Come on. - Hey, hey, take it easy. Take a breath, look, you're safe now, all right? Now, what's your name? - My name's Josh McMahon. I'm with Point Zero Media out of Nashville. - Okay, and who'd you say held you hostage? - His name's Kyle Baker, all right? You gotta help me, man. - Okay, where is he now, Kyle? Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me. Where is Kyle now? - Man, I don't know. He could be watching us, man. We gotta go. - What about Red Wilson? We got a report about Red Wilson. - Oh man, he, he, he, he left this morning. I don't know, he could be dead for all I know. - I need you to take me to the trap. - What? - The trap. We got a report about a trap where you were being held hostage. I need you to take me there. - But I don't understand, I escaped. We should just... What are you doing, man? - I know who you are. - I told you, I'm Josh. - You're Red Wilson! I remember you from the Hector Ramirez case. Now, put your hands where I can see 'em. Now, take me to the trap. Hey, hands where I can see 'em! (Red laughs) - You know, man, I was just on the other side of this thing. - Hey, Red, don't do something you're gonna regret. - I won't. (laughs) - Hey, you're gonna take me to the trap, all right? And you're not gonna put up a fight, and you'll be in way less trouble, you understand? We'll go, I'll take you. - All right. You know, man, I really do appreciate what you do. - That's great. - I'm sorry you had-- - Let's go. - Okay. - Let's go. (Red laughs) (footsteps thudding) - Officer, in here. - Is there anyone else out here? - No, sir. It's just us. - What's your name? - Josh McMahon. I made the 911 call. - You fuckin' liar! - All right, down on your knees. Get down on your knees, now! Now! - Use the keys on his hip to unlock the trap. (keys jangle) - Goddamn it, I need backup. - You can get a cell signal if you climb on top of the trap. - Okay, gotcha, thank you. Don't you move, I will shoot you. (suspenseful music) (shoes thudding) (officer grunts) (Red grunts) (rifle clicks) (roof creaks) (buttons beep) (suspenseful music continues) - Officer, look out! (rifle blasts) (officer groans) (body thuds) (officer groans) (suspenseful music continues) (officer groans) (footsteps thudding) (gunshot blasts) (Red groans) (boot thuds) (Red grunts) (boot thuds) Oh, God. (boot thuds) Damn it. (boot thuds) All right, you got me pretty good. But not good enough. (suspenseful music continues) (keys jangle) (handcuffs click) Aw, fuck. Okay, okay. Okay. I'm gonna put him in there with you, okay? So just step back. - What? - I'm gonna put him in there with you. Where are my keys? Where are my keys? Officer. Hey, officer. Officer, hey, wake up. Hey, man. Hey, wake up. (hand slaps) Hey, wake up. Hey, hey. Hey, wake up, officer. Hey! Hey. (suspenseful music continues) - What is it? - Oh my God. - [Josh] What? - He's dead. - What? - I don't know, man. I don't, I don't know what happened. I just kicked him, I wasn't trying to kill him. I don't know if he had a heart attack or a fuckin' aneurysm or-- - How do you know? Check his pulse. - I did, man. I checked his pulse. I kicked, I just kicked him, that's all I did. I wasn't trying to kill him. - Red, we gotta call somebody. - No, man. No, I can't. I gotta... I gotta do something about it. (groans) (keys jangle) (suspenseful music) Okay. Okay, all right. (nose snorts) (keys jangle) Oh my God. Oh, you've done it now, Red. You killed a fuckin' cop. Oh my God, what am I gonna do? (gate bangs) Oh my God. Fuckin' goddamn it, hey! (suspenseful music) (footsteps thud) (suspenseful music continues) (Josh groans) (body thuds) (men grunting) (fist pounds) (Red groans) (men grunting) (rifle blasts) (Red groans) (suspenseful music) (Josh panting) (rifle blasts) (suspenseful music) (Josh panting) (brush rustles) (rifle blasts) Josh. Ah, shit. Josh! I can't hear you running. So you must be hiding. And I know these woods. There's only a couple places you could be. Maybe we could come to an agreement. Get some blood on your hands. We get rid of the cop. We go our separate ways. You got your leverage back. (suspenseful music) There you are. (rifle blasts) (Josh panting) Shit! (suspenseful music) (Josh panting) - [Josh] Oh, shit. (rifle blasts) (suspenseful music continues) - Last one's for you, Kyle. (lips smacking) (Josh panting) (rifle blasts) (Josh groans) - Fuck! Goddamn it! - Gotcha. - [Josh] Ah, fuck! - Don't you fuckin' move! - You fuckin' shot me! - That's right, pussy. Where are my keys? Keys, where are my fuckin' keys? (keys jangle) - [Josh] Fuck! - You know, you sure do change your tune when there's a gun in your face. - I'll do whatever you want, all right? Just fuck, don't shoot me. Fuck! Don't fucking shoot me, goddamn it! Fuck! - All right, get up, I got a plan. Come on, get up! - That's right, it's fucked! - Come on, get up! (Josh grunts) What the fuck are you doing? You wanna die? Do you wanna fuckin' die? Come on, move! Let's go! Move it! (tense music) - They're gonna be a little suspicious when the body's covered in dirt. - We'll clean him up real good, just keep going. (tense music) - Red, can I just have some-- - You'll get water when you're done. Just keep going. - I'm gonna pass out. I haven't had any water since yesterday. - You're gonna be fine! Now keep going! You know I ain't lying. There really is a squatch out here. - Then why fake it? - Because I don't wanna be made a laughing stock. I wanna make my pawpaw proud. Now, come on, get him out of this costume. Come on, hurry up! (body thuds) (Josh groans) You know, you're not a bad guy, Josh. Why are you doing stories like this? - We all gotta make money, right? - Come on. I make a living off these. Why don't you try answering that again? What's a guy like you doing bullying regular folks? - Honestly, man, I fell into it, okay? I had an assignment to interview these right wing protestors. Story ended up being funny. Next thing you know, I got a show. Girlfriend moves in. I wanted to make my way up as a journalist. I never saw it as bullying. - Well, that's not up to you. Now, come on, let's get him back up to camp. Oh, come on, stop your moping. Come on. - Dude, he's heavy and he reeks, okay? - Then maybe you shouldn't have fuckin' shot him! Now move! (somber piano music) Cop and a drug dealer get into an altercation and kill each other. How sad. Happens all the time. - How do you explain the 911 call? - Ah, we'll just tell him that you, you were forced to blame me at gunpoint or something. Come on, let's move. Let's move, come on. Come on, let's go. All right, go get the laptop. (gate clangs) (suspenseful music) - (groans) Red, stop. Red, quit. - No, come on. Go in. (gate clangs) - Thought we had a deal. Come on, man, I'm here to help. - Well, the dynamics changed again. I found another shell. - That gun was empty? - Beautiful thing, ain't it? (suspenseful music) Shooting Kyle will be the last thing you're known for. I'm gonna tell you a story. Don't worry, you'll like this story. It's got a good ending. Six hours before my pawpaw died of a heart attack, he made me a Bigfoot T-shirt with his own two hands. Not too different from the one I'm wearing now. It was a pink and blue tie-dye shirt with the words, "I believe" written across it, and the Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot right below it. Well, sure enough, his heart gave out that evening, and suddenly that shirt became my most prized possession. My daddy didn't care for it much. He come home one night, all fucked up, screaming at me. "Take that thing off. "You look like a goddamn hippie!" I told him no. And he ripped that shirt off my back. Smacked me across the back of the head. "Your pawpaw's dead. "I want you to drop the Bigfoot thing." I fished the T-shirt out of the trash and hid it in my backpack. Wore it to school the next day. Half as a fuck you to my daddy, and half as a way to keep my pawpaw with me. When I got to school, the kids started bullying me, which wasn't unusual, but it got a lot worse on account of that shirt. They started calling me Bigfoot faggot. I hate that word now. Faggot. They started bashing my face against a water fountain and kicking the shit out of me and all that. And then I met this kid named Kyle, the one you so graciously shot and killed. Kyle was gay for real. They all called him faggot too. You gotta remember, this was the South in '04 so that kind of thing didn't fly. Kyle and I became inseparable, which didn't help my reputation none. Kyle told me he was gonna help me find Bigfoot. That we would make everyone who ever doubted us sorry. He believed in me, man. Man, with Kyle gone and my squatching career in danger, I don't know. The whole situation's just gotten too fucked up. All I know is they're gonna find you dead in that cage. And they're gonna find this with you shooting Kyle on it. (suspenseful music) And as for me, well. (rifle blasts) (blood spurts) (body thuds) Red. Red! Red! Red, wake up. Stop playing, Red. Stop playing, stop playing, Red. Wake up. (cries) Red, fuck. Oh, please. (Josh coughs) (Josh cries) Help! Somebody! Hello! Somebody! Help. Somebody, help. Help. Help. (insects chirping) Water. (insects chirping) (grunts) Water. (Josh panting) Man, fuck. (rock taps) Oh, fuck! (rock taps) Come on. Fuck! (fist bangs) Goddamn it! (tense music) (soft growling) (tense music continues) Red? Where'd you go? (footsteps pounding) (footsteps pounding) (creature growling) (footsteps pounding) (creature growling) What the hell? What the? (creature grunting) Kyle? (creature grunting) (creature grunting) (tense music continues) (crate clanks) (creature barking loudly) (footsteps pounding) Oh shit. (footsteps pounding) (rock tapping) (creature grunting) (rock tapping) (creature grunting) (footsteps pounding) (suspenseful music) (creature grunting) (footsteps pounding) (creature growling) (bars squeaking) (creature grunting) (gate clanking) (creature grunting) (footsteps pounding) (creature growls) (Josh groans) (Josh grunts) (creature groans) (suspenseful music) (Josh panting) (creature grunting) (suspenseful music) (Josh panting) (Josh groans) (body thuds) (Josh coughs) (suspenseful music continues) (footsteps pounding) (creature grunting) (leaves rustling) (hand banging) (suspenseful music) (Hector screaming) (suspenseful music rises) (Josh gasps) (creature growls) (leaves rustling) (Josh gasps) (suspenseful drumming music) (Josh grunts) (creature growls) (creature roars) (Josh panting) (footsteps thudding) (creature roars) (suspenseful music continues) (creature grunts) (creature grunts) (footsteps pound) (creature grunts) (feet thud) (fists pound) (creature grunts) (creature grunts) (shovel thuds) (creature roars) (feet thud) (footsteps pounding) (Josh panting) (Josh cries) (somber piano music) (crickets chirping) (footsteps thudding) These past three days were an intense, traumatic experience. I know you probably won't believe the story I've just shared with you, but it's true. Oh, Red. My phone was smashed, my laptop was smashed, and my memory cards were wiped. I got a few clips back from a data recovery team, but most of it's gone. This includes my encounter with the Sasquatch, something I don't expect most people to believe. (gravel crunching) Red Wilson went through a lot in his short life. But finding Bigfoot gave him purpose, gave him meaning. (phone rings) After my time with him, I can honestly say I believe him. What do you think? (laptop lid slams) - I didn't laugh once. - I just thought that-- - Ah, ah, ah, ah. Don't you have any footage from the first couple of days? You know, before all that shit went down? Something funny? - I was almost killed. - Which sucks, but I was wondering if we didn't have something more clickable. - Clickable? I had an encounter with an actual Sasquatch. - Allegedly. - What the hell do you think beat me up so bad? - Do you know how crazy you sound? We're a news site, not a tabloid. - You don't believe me? - Well, duh. You don't have any footage of the thing. - Look, just upload it, okay? If the video bombs, you can fire me on the spot. - If it bombs, do I still have to pay you for the video? - No. - Deal. 500,000 views and you can keep your job. - [Steph] Maybe he won't fire you. - 50,000 views in one weekend's considered a huge flop. - So, what now? - We can't afford for me to get fired. - Maybe this is a good thing. (lips smacking) - Maybe. God, everyone who saw that video probably thinks I'm crazy. - It was a pretty crazy story. - You believe me, don't you? - [Steph] Of course I do. - You believe I saw Sasquatch? - I believe you saw something and that it attacked you. - So, no? - Look, you went through a lot of trauma. I mean, who knows what you saw? - I know what I saw. - I'm surprised Tiggs has given you another chance. (trunk door slams) - Yeah, for two free videos. - [Flat Earther] The Earth's flat and that's that! - Ready for part two? - Don't really have another choice. - [Flat Earther] And that's that! The Earth's flat and that's that! The Earth's flat and that's that! - Coming? - I can't. - What? - I can't do it. (somber folk music) - Are you serious? Dude, Tiggs will fire you. - Then he fires me. There's a line with this stuff. - Come on, man! She's crazy! (somber folk music continues) (car door bangs) - [Steph] I just don't think that chasing Bigfoot is the answer. - [Josh Voiceover] Look, this is a story of a lifetime, Steph. - Yeah, and what about us? What about our life here? - I'm going to Red's cabin, all right? Come with me. - To find Bigfoot? - Yes. All right, look, this could change the world. I want you with me. - Josh. - I owe it to Red. - Red tried to kill you. You don't owe him anything. - You don't know what I saw. Red didn't deserve what happened to him. Kyle didn't deserve what I did to him. (somber folk music continues) I gotta fix things. I gotta go do this.
