Hello, my name is Eloise. This is where I was born. No, not in the field, but well you'll see in a moment is he, My dad was an inventor and once upon a time he invented something really amazing. It made a lot of money and we lived in a big house in the country. But the trouble was dad never ever invented anything else that made any more money. And then one day dad asked his favourite child, There's always a favourite to help and well, something awful happened. Well, that was seven years ago, and now we've come home to where it all started back home at Dark Heart manner. Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry, you'll have the necklace. Yes, she did wear them. I'll do my best. I. . Hello. How are you? All right, thanks. So here we are then back home. It's Shane. We only come. Back here when something bad happens. Something bad is what sent us all away. Darling, can you get my pastina out please? Hi Carl. Get mine as well. Will you, Colin? Right? Anyways. Have you got the keys? I'm not standing out here anymore. We're in here somewhere. Come on, Mary Poppins. They're probably hidden under the hat stand. Bottom. Key doesn't seem to work. So how's Colin? Oh, same as usual. Ah, is he not coming in? He's just unpacking the waitress shopping. Waitrose. Yeah, I had the foresight to pick some things up at our local one after he'd come back from Cowells last night. I knew no one else would think about it. So come on, Eloise. Dad might have changed the locks again. I just want to get somewhere. There is potentially some central heating. Colin Pina. Is my tooth chi. Are you being serious? Why would you think you've chipped your tooth? Tell him it's fallen out. I think I did it when I was getting outta the car. On what? Your ego. Does it feel different when your. Tongue limit. Run your tongue along it. It feels a bit jagged, but Oh, it's alright, don't worry. It's just about these TP awards. I wondered how long it was gonna take to say the word awards. What. Awards? What awards? Oh. Did you not read about it in heat? I can't repeat heat. What awards he talk you about? I've got these best daytime TV presenter awards tomorrow night, right? Is this that auction thing you do? Oh. You've seen it, have you? Well, no, but I think someone mentioned it. I don't watch daytime tv. Well, neither do I. I'm on it. Jesus. Bloody draughts doors always slamming. I had hope Dad might have fixed that. I remember dad saying the slamming doors were caused by the restless soul of a gamekeeper walled up in the cell for. Poaching. Dad was good at not adding to hysteria. He told me that the slamming was the house protecting itself against the invaders. When were you last here? Seven years ago. Toms, you know. You haven't been to see dad in seven years. When did you last see dad? Easy to point the finger, isn't it? I guess he was on Tell. I'm having my old run. Okay, now you've gotta look straight up and try not to get anything on the edge of your vision. What? Like. Trees? Now trees are right out. It's gotta be sky only. Sky. Got it? Yep. Just. Go. Okay, now picture the world. It's a huge ball and you're lying on top of that ball looking up into space, but the world is round. Now imagine what it would be like if you were lying on the bottom of that ball looking down into infinity. What. You mean like upside. Down? Yeah, absolutely. And only gravity is holding you from falling off into the bottomless of forever. Can you feel it? It's sort of like an optical illusion. You've gotta really believe it. That's really weird. I feel like I'm looking down. Okay, now you've gotta look straight up trying to get anything else in your vision. Just sky. Okay, now you really good at it. You feel like you're about to fall off the planet. Oh. My God, I just felt like I was levitating. That's. So wicked. That's. Really what happens. If I really believe it. I suppose you just fall off into space. . Now really concentrate on one particular bit of sky and really think hard about it being below you instead of above you. Hello. Niece. What? It's Uncle Simon. Oh, Uncle Simon. You're up late, aren't you? It. Is lunch time. What? Oh, listen. Something's happened. Look, I'm up for best daytime presenter. This isn't about you. Really, Yesian. It's all about who you are with and how good she looks and you know it. What if you do win and I'm wearing the expensive diamonds. I can't right now. I've got a call for sister. Not that stupid boring one you told me about. No, the other one. Eloise. She's got no fashion. Since. I've gotta go. Your. Whole family's. Rubbish. Donna. Or I'm gone. Hello dear sister, what can I do for you? It's. About dad. He's a, He's dead. I'm sorry. Somehow dad, I've. Got a feeling that everything's gonna change. Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna. I dunno what you see in her yet. She's awful. She's a bit rough around the edges, but she cares for me. I hate her hair. Plastic hair can't stand it. And a noticeable Ack. She's so desperate. Proper, desperate. You can actually smell the desperation. You can smell it. Wanna. Do you mind? I've just had this. Look, you know, know as station manager, You should really be taking me to the awards. Not miss Circle of Shame. You're going to the awards with who? Donna. Donna. Donna. I know. We told him. Look, take me to the awards or lose me forever. My heart's in the right place. What? In Silicon Valley. I mean. What? Mr. Jones? I'm Sally Sneed from M gtv. I was just wondering, could you spare a sec to talk to us about the awards? That'd be brilliant. Oh yeah. Yeah. Any publicity's? Good publicity. Mr. Jones. Talk. About Knack. Knack. Thank you. I'd be happy to. Cool. Great. Barry. Okay. Hi, I'm Sally Sneed and I'm here with best daytime TV presenter nominee Yesian Jones. Hello, Sally. Now the viewers at home have one burning question to ask. Yes. What will Donna be wearing to the awards? God. And why are you named after a book? It's not after a book. My grandfather, Jeremiah Jones was a pilot and my dad. I'm sorry, but dad's gone. We're all busy. We need to clear the house, sell it, and move on. What do you mean sell the house? You can't. Sell the house. It's dad's life. It's our life. And this could be worth millions Suki. Well, the way the market's looking at the moment, I think it's probably worth two mil. But then we are gonna be stung for a lot of inheritance. Tax vultures. That's 500 grand each. 500 grand each. Look, we can't sell the house. Dad wouldn't want us to do that. It's nothing to do with dad anymore. We didn't do enough for dad when he was alive. So maybe now we should make more of an effort. Now he's dead. That. Doesn't make any sense. 500 Grand each. Half a million could do a lot with that. What are you expecting us to do? Open it up as a stately home and masal Liam to a mad professor. Please don't talk. I don't like. That. You can't realistically think of keeping it on. It's gonna take staff to run it and look after that massive garden. So you are just living in La la land. No. Now you promised you wouldn't say that. Look, I'm not a child anymore, so don't treat me like what? Girls? Girls. I can get someone from my show to have a look at everything. See if anything has any value. Money. That's all you ever think about. What are the practicalities of what you're suggesting? Well, I can call Nick knacks and we can get the good stuff taken to the studio. It'll. All have to be audited and itemised. No guys, Guys, you've all got loads of stuff. I don't have any stuff. So we don't wanna get rid of the stuff because this is our stuff. Eloquently put. Look, I don't have any stuff. I've got this bed and a weird armchair that smells so we can't just let strangers come in here and go step away. Okay? Cherry. Pick the stuff you want. Now. What happened seven years ago? Destroyed this family. It's the only. Would anyone ever want to come back to the scene of Tom's. Death? It's not the scene of Tom's death. It's the only thing that's gonna keep us together. Otherwise, what is it? An email every six months if that. Come on. I've gotta pack up. Let's have a really good look around the place first. See what there is. Fine. I'll order it as we go. Are we gonna go together or separately? Together? Fine. We didn't even talk about dad. Death. Is it the end or a gateway to something else? I once asked dad what happens after we die? He told me we get married in the mud and worms eat our bodies. I guess he didn't want to tell me the truth that most of us go to hell and burn eternally. He probably didn't want to upset me. I. Think Rub Chan. I love that one with me and dad. We got any more keys? Can't seem to get into dad's. Lab. No, the front door key. I wonder where they are. There's a whole. Load of keys in a drawer over there. Oh. I can't get in there either. Where they, No luck. None. You know where we haven't looked? Tom's room. Doesn't. Feel right being here. Do you think that maybe if the world's okay, then I might be able to turn this place into a hotel or a hostel. Maybe an artist retreat. I'd be good at that. We could rename the house, break the curse of dark heart manner once and for all. If that's what you want. I promise I'll help. Look at this. The yellow by plane's gone. Look. Oh my God, it's back over there. How? Maybe one of dad's inventions. Oh my God. It won't do it if we'll walk it. S That's freaky deaky. Come on, we can look at this tomorrow. I've gotta get this. Hi. Sorry darling. No, I was just talking to no, not another woman. No. Eloise, my sister. The hangar. We're not allowed in there without dad. Dad's not around to stop us from going in. I've gotta go. Wow. I love. This place so much. Can't believe how grubby it is. Something feels really weird. I think dad was low. I mean really low. This magazine says 2004. 2004. That was the last time I was here. Me too. Not me. Why would he stop flying the plane? It doesn't make any sense. Poor old tongue. Old. He was 22. He died. He don't get much older than that. Excuse been me that died. I for God's sake. Come on, let's get inside. Don't be ridiculous. Look. Wait, we need to talk about this. Not. In here. I'm freezing. Look, Dad clearly hasn't set foot in here for years. Let's get inside quickly. I don't get it. Well. Fine. We'll leave you here then. Wait, wait. What? Now. You and me in the tree. She called you out. You have to go to the tree. It's the rules. Oh, it doesn't get any smaller . I would it. Well, you know when you get older things that were big as a kid. Yeah. Like waggon wheels. God, it was magical wasn't it? It's just a place to go away from the house. It wasn't special. Really? Why do you always do that? Just being practical. Be beep gum builder. Let me say always the right thing and never the wrong thing. I'm not trying to say the right and I am never angry. You asked me a question, didn't you? Did you or did you not ask me if I thought it was magical? Yeah. And no I didn't because I realised it's just a tree. I am a wise woman. I know everything. I realise that a tree is just a tree and anyone can sit up just being pragmatic. Brag. Somebody had something. Burnt. Marta again. Beep . Look how magic this place was. Don't you remember? We were happy here. How could you all leave? Hang on. You left two. Yeah. But I was 17. I didn't have a clue what was going on. All I knew is that Tom had died, Mum had left and dad was going mad. Hey, don't pass any blame onto us guys. Please don't argue. Because we were older, we could see what was going on and had to deal with it too. Oh, shut up. . We're not putting up with this. Me neither. This is why we left. Guys. Hello. Hello. I'm Rupert Deadlock from Deadlock and Roberts. I've come to talk about Mr. Jones' estate. I spoke to Mr. Simon Jones. Hello. Uncle Simon. Stay here. Thanks. Zuki. Alzheimer's henchman has arrived. M circling already. Huh? Hello. I'm Zuki the youngest daughter. This is Colin, my husband. Hello everyone. After the death of a person proceedings start to execute the will and distribute any wealth and assets. Now, you may or may not know that your father did leave a will and now that the police are satisfied that there was no foul play. What do you mean no foul play? The verdict was death by mis adventure. He electro kissed himself. You didn't. He didn't know that. No. How could we, Uncle Simon just called me and then I called the others. I thought you could've spoken to the police. Why? Just thought you would've. We didn't even get to go to the funeral. Uncle Simon took so bloody long to tell us. Funeral. There hasn't been a funeral. The body's still at the mortuary. Please just get on with the will. We can sort the rest of this mess out later. Fine. Fine. Now your father, Mr. John, Jeremy James Jones had planned to leave the house to all the children to be divided equally. But he was conducting some very expensive research these last seven years. The bank bailed him out several times but it had to stop. Stop. Yes. Stop. He defaulted on several loan repayments. Loans. I never borrowed any money. You mean it isn't Towers? Yes. I'm sorry. The bank owns the house. He was 200,000 pounds behind with the loan repayment. 200,000 pounds. And what are they going to. Do with it? Well, I think the plan is demolish the house demo. There's a property developer who's had die on the area for quite a while now. Demolish the house. Building a shopping arcade or something. Well, we have to get our money back somehow. What's the time scale? I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to start moving out straight away. You've got a few days to vacate and demolition. Demolition commences on the. 11Th. Get out. Get out. Of my house. I'm just the messenger. Yes. Then so off. So off Mercury. The No. You'll. Regret that. I'll have you out for assault. This is a new suit. Oh, . I can't. Believe dad spent our. House. God, he really messed up. Didn't he? How could he have spent 200 K? We have to get into dad's lap. We need to find out what the hell he spent all our money on. D Oh. . Oh, I can go my, Oh. Can someone get that. Morning? Bloody long drive You got here. I should be paid by the mile to do this job. I help you. Yeah. Could you sign for this please? Okay. And this heavy one sign again please. And one more. How many more of these things are. There's actually this one. Another bloody lots. One more sign perfectly with your name this time. Sure. Thank you. Have a nice day. Okay. You got the necklace? Yes darling. It better be the one that Posh had Buck said that he could get me Kylie's Tiara. From. Yeah. Well I'm sure Buck can do a lot of things, but I've got the diamonds you wanted. Okay, good. See you tomorrow. What's that all about? I thought I saw Tom. Tom. What did he look like? Well, you know like Tom. Tom then Not Tom. Now. That's a stupid question. Tom then alive Tom and he was all. A what. Without. A focus. Blurry. I couldn't really see him properly. He but he walk like Tom. You okay? Yes. Look at Tad Peaky. Just had a bit of a shock. That's. All electric. No, he just thought he saw someone in the garden. Is anyone seen the so key for dad's. Lap? What's this clown meeting for? Thought I saw someone look like Tom. I don't think this is funny. I'm. Not trying to be funny. Just the house staring up memories. Why do you have to be so logical? Because. Without logical people, the world wouldn't function. This family wouldn't function. This family doesn't function. It could have been a ghost. Tom's ghost. And then what? Talk of ghosts. And poor old Tom. I don't like it. Forget it. I've gotta make some calls. Good. Turn for the key. Let's see what else can find. You. Okay. It's all so, it's so awful. I mean, Tom and mum and now dad. I mean if someone doesn't make any bloody decisions, then what? It's okay. So there's always been me, the sensible one. Sorting everything out, never having any fun. Maybe. We can have a nice few days here. Say goodbye to your dad. This house, it's wretched house. It just makes me feel like I'm a failure. No, no. Eloise has failed in love and work and well everything. Yours will never be the TV God He so wants. And mom died and dad died. And Tom, my little brother, he failed to have an existence and I failed to have a family. Jesus us. What a bunch of failures we've turned out to be. It's supposed to be a bloody holiday. It's so typical of daddy's bloody selfish. Even after death is stupid. Inventions bug everything up. It was his inventions that bought the house in the first place. God sake. Colin, you're as bad as Eloise. Come on then. Go and check the pantry. I can't do it on my own. I've got you a van. One of Nick NA's productions assistants will drive it around on Sunday. Cuz everyone has to be back at work on Monday apart for you. Of course. How big is it? Oh, thank you you and it's very kindly, but just sort of van out for me. Lovely. You are a nice brother. How big is it? Like a transit van, not a. Loise. Would you like me to put you together a basic starter kit to someone living on their own cooking? Thanks. I've been eating my own food since I was 17. And you're still not dead. So I'm simply asking, would you like me to pick you out a frying pan and some utensils? I'd like one of those forks. That's. A spoon. A spo. You'll have to go to mills for that. I'll be in the kitchen. I'm going to go upstairs, see if I can find something useful. Dad once said a home is only a home because of its ghosts. Who are the echoes of people snag behind like wool on a nail. Without them, it's just a house. He also said treat each day as your last because one day you'll be right. What are we gonna do with all this stuff, Collin? EBay. Not helpful, Cole. I actually don't wanna get rid of it. Most of stuff is rubbish. Why keep it memories? This was mum's. I dunno. It's just not how it should end. It isn't the end. You get to choose when the chapter ends. Do you wanna hand with anything? Yeah. Actually can you take this chair down to the hall for me? Careful though. I think it might be antique. Oh is it? Oh I don't mean I have any value. I just mean it's old. I think I've seen Mine is on the show. I like it. It's gonna be my reading chair. Yeah. Well I think I might like to leave this here if it doesn't fit in the van perhaps. Do you want it? Well, it's something I could do. You want it? Well, if it doesn't fit in. The van, do you want it? Yes. I would quite like it. Yes. What for? We've we're doing a chair week on Knicknacks chair. But I want it and I do not wanna hear about your weird sorted chair week. I actually want to sit on it. Well. Could I just bore it then? Bring it back after show. You. Said you didn't want any of this Chuffing tat. So I'm having it. Sorry, I better get this. Do you remember that one? Why did you put the phone down on me? Do you. Remember this cd? You wanna come over here? I remember that one. Do you remember this Cole? Yes I do. Unfortunately. . Can you just give us a bit of time? What was my favourite song? Let go. Like do you remember the words? What the. Words? I used to play this all the time. I remember my sleep. I used to remember this classic. The bravest. Animals in this land would. Captain be Andand. There's Tim. Breakfast rats. Artful Hour. Guys. You said no. About his Sid was the noise just singing? Do you remember this? We used to play it all the time. We were so annoying. You did? I'm gonna get CD from the car. Hello? Hello? I say hello. Hello. Guess who I found Dad's lap. Wow. This is amazing. Don't forget. Found the key. Careful just careful. Okay. You dunno what your father was working. On? Come on. It was probably some new type of milk container or maybe salate. That doesn't tear your lip off when you try and bite it in two. Well, I don't like it. It gives me the willies. Oh my God. Look. Oh dear. It's it's all plugged in. . Oh look, it's. Dad. Password please. Password. Any ideas? Snowy. Snowy? Yeah. Tinting and snowy. Okay. Nope. It is. It's tinting and snowy. Okay. Does it have a number. Then? Oh snowy threes number three. Thank you. Huh? How did you know that? Was it just your dad? Huh? It says there's a component missing. What does it look like? How the hell should I know you knob? Look, I've gotta keep an eye on the dinner. Let me know if you see anything interesting. So this is what dad spent all our inheritance on. What the hell? It looks like some sort of, Oh it's mom. What were you doing at the special tree? I saw a man. Zuki. What do you mean you saw a man? There was a man. It was weird. He looked sort of outta focus. Thought I'd leave Al to get on with it. You right. Cool. Look ladies see a ghost. Well done. Very well done. What did I do? Colin's got a bit of a problem with the paranormal. The paranormal? Yeah. There was an incident at college that upset him. Oh yeah. Well I like the sound of an incident. Oh God. If you could get your mind out of the gutter for just one second, it would make all our lives so much better. I'm hurt by that remark. Anyway. Tell me of this incident. I'm at college. Colin tried to make a bit of money by faking some ghost photos. What? Like Darren Brown, fraudulent mediums and all that. Bullock. Sort of he and offended it and they made a bit of money. Only Colin thought his mate. Carl was doing the photos, but he wasn't. Oh, sorry. I don't follow you. Carl wasn't making the pictures. Colin was. Carl was making the pictures. Yes. Without knowing it. When he found out he had a bit of a panic attack and now he thinks he's a psychic photographer. Colin Cole. Psychic. I know. I shouldn't have told you. Look, he gets upset about it. Why is he always taking photos then? He won't take photos of people. Only things. Oh, that's brilliant. Just when you think you work somebody. Else. Look, if you ever tell Colin that I told you I will cut your balls. Off. This is ridiculous. I have a clue what I'm doing. Dad once told me he was writing a book about anti-gravity. He said it was impossible to put down. And then I saw a picture of Tom and it all began to make sense. Smells this. It's just savoury, mince. Keeping it simple. You're not vegetarian at the moment. Are you one of these? Huh? As we're all here in this house. Post toast to mum, to dad to dead. Tom. I do. We wouldn't say that. Don't call him dead Tom. Okay. Poor Tom then. That's better. Much better to poor. What means your life Chip should be pleased. Someone's out there. Hello Helloe. How many times do we have to flash until he goes away? Haven't seen you since our wedding. You see how long. Then? You remember. Shagging my bridesmaid. Soy. I am deeply hurt. That was an accident. Come. Oh, be nice. I bought chocolates and booze. Yes. Oh, little to . Oh lovely. What have we got here? Ooh. Yeah. Yum. Yum. Pigs bum. Help yourself. Thank you to my brother James. Today. Today. Very nice. So where have you been anyway? Simon been travelling a lot of work overseas. Oh yeah. Where? Well, I went to Paris, which was beautiful. Amsterdam, which was beautiful. Munich, which was beautiful. Warsaw, which was depressing. You like Warsaw. Uhhuh, very funny. And now I'm back just like you. And the house needs salti. 40 years of secrets here. Maybe you and me tomorrow we could relive the old times. Yeah. Go back up the special tree. Why is it the special tree anyway? I mean there's hundreds. Because dad put a seat in it and we could see the house and not be seen from the house. No, that's not why it's the special tree. It's because when you are in the tree you feel something special. Something something magic. The first time that I went up there, I felt this thing brush against my face. It was sort of like a butterfly wing, but bigger. Oh what? Like a leaf on a branch? No, like a butterfly wing, but bigger. And then I saw something and it was sort of small and quite and quite squirrly. What? Like. A squirrel? No, not like a squirrel. I saw, I really thought I saw something. What? At the end of the story. I mean you really thought you saw something. No. Cause I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the story cuz SU's just to ruin it. Well I. Want to hear more about the tree, the special tree. Okay. Carry on now. Okay. Well when I told dad about the butterfly wing against my face, he built me a fairy trap. It was such a load of old nonsense jealousy. Hardly. I mean, she was about 10. Yes, I was 10. Thank you. But I mean, come on. Why anything then? Why Father Christmas? Why the tooth fairy? Why eat ice cream? Why didn't you sit in the dark eating bread and butter banging your head against a brick. Wall? You're just being obtuse. Why even imagine anything? Why read a book? Why you just burn all the books? Ding. Ding. Round two 10 is far too old for a fairy trap. Dad knew that. And there's no such thing as fairies. One just died. Well, I believed him then he made me a fairy chap. Cause he knew that I wanted one. He could have got me something like a barbie, which was real, but rubbish he got made me something I would want. Well, you and he got better than me. He mean he what? With the grammar. Oh, sorry. Sorting off. Ladies. That's just typical of that living in a fantasy world populated by fairies is just building up hopes and dreams when ultimately they're gonna be dashed. Not a so schizophrenic, little really mentally disturbed. You get over that stuff. So what happened to the fairy trap? Well, I thought I'd set it really late night before I went to bed. And one day Tom and I woke up and we went down to the fairy trap and. There was a fairy trapped in the trap. And dad set her free. I remember saying, I fly off. It was amazing. Will I never saw anything like that. Maybe you were too busy not believing in the unbelievable. I only went out the tree to get away from you. Law. You spoiled the tree. Miss sour face. He loved you. You know, killed him when Tom died. Killed him even more. When each one of you left. Do you know what he was working on? No. That it was complicated and expensive. Something. Something. Something. What? Something. Bad. Don't be ridiculous. Some of those components cost a fortune. He. Keeps talking about crossing the void and jumping. Space time, stuff like that. Oh, that was into all kinds of stuff. Space travel, parallel universes. Time and travel. Alternative dimension. Time travel. You don't think. No. Dad was working on a time machine. To go back and save Tom before. He killed him. That's just stupid. I mean, listen to yourselves. Time travel. You've. Been watching too much. Dr. Who? I quite like the new doctor. What do you think? Well, well it's not Ryan. Tom Baker is the. Best. Oh, you have to admit tenant was. Excellent. Yeah, I really love the gay garlic episode. Dad wasn't working on a time machine. What? He wasn't working on a time machine. It says here he was working on a machine to get to the dead. World. He was trying to find out where you go when you die. He was trying to get to the afterlife. Trick or treat what. Trick or treat. But it isn't even Halloween. It's. Not Halloween. Mom said we can't go out dress like this on Halloween. And H it isn't Halloween. So we're dress like this. Okay. Drink or treat. Well, we haven't got any sweets. It's okay. Right. Boy Christ. I need that. Like off the tell. Oh yes. My gra likes you. Sort off your little shits. Who was that? Nothing. Just a fan. So who was it? It was the grim Reaper. That's not important. What. Have we got there? Component 63,702. I think this is the missing part of dad's computer. Dad must have ordered it before he died weeks ago. And it's only just arrived. Let's try that. Now we can finish the machine. Okay. You take the study for any other notebooks. Suki. Put. The cat on. Look at this. You. Oh, that's no way to talk to your granddad, is it? I wouldn't do that if I was you. He never did get it Earthed properly. I did tell him. I. I, Are you really? Yes darling. It's me. Your girl. Silly. No. I'm dead. I know. Your dad was a very clever man. What. Did dad do? Your dad, She had done, she speaking to the day he wanted to talk to Tom. Just. Bloody hell. Those little trick or treaters slashed Uncle Simon's tyres. He's out there now with Colin. They're not happy. Zuki. You need to see this. Anne. Well. Well, I thought dad was working on some sort of time machine. Like, Well, we discussed it, supper. And I thought maybe he was going this bit mental. And I was looking at everything and it was so confusing. And then I looked at this be jar. Looks like a lava me. And that is a lava lamp. This. Is a beacon. And granddad's face appeared out of nowhere. Right? Well, you got something serious to say. Oh. For one second. Open your tiny mind. I thought you were actually gonna say something important because now you're talking bollocks. She's telling the truth. Oh. Oh. It's typical of you two ganging up on me trying to make me look stupid. Dad made a machine for talking to the dead. Nonsense. Look, I was sitting here and I pressed this button and touched this. And then a spark flew and grandad was talking to me and he was like, Oh, hey Eloise. How's it going? Granddad never spoke like that. Maybe not to you. He always spoke to me like that. It's.

This one is kind of a China teapot. It's quite flash. It's Ming the merciless, not the Yes. Anyway, you get the gist. Yes. It's teapot. You can put water in it. Boiling water. Normally I put in it you put tea in it. You can get tea from anywhere. India, China shops mainly. That's where I go. I went to India once. Not for the tea. I just went to India. It's got a spout. No, it's got a kind of a handly thing. It's got a lid, which you can it doesn't actually fit. It's from somewhere else, I think. But you can put it in there. Well, we'll come back to that. And you can do that. And it stops the tea falling out. It's probably worth at least 24, maybe 25 pence. Yeah I've seen several of these before. This. Who made it? Isn't the best one. Who made it? It was made by Timothy Dalton. Oh no, Royal Dalton. Sorry. He collects them. Timothy, Personal friend of mine. Actually. What can I say? It's got a lid. I could probably put some sugar in that. Or snuff out a candle. Maybe. Not really much more I can say about it. Really? I'm getting really fed up. I mean, It's got some holes in the lid if anyone's interested. I'm not. You might be. I've seen the way you look at it. You want it, don't you? Is it the spout? Yeah, it's your dirty urchin. Yeah. Well you can make noises as well. You can. Oh shit. I said it was worth 25 pence. It's probably worth about three PEs. Now I've just broken a bit of it off. That suits me that.
