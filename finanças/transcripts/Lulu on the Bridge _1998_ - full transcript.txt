There you are. Come on, Izzy, let's go. They're waiting for us. Just a second. I can't go on with my dick hanging out, can I? Izzy! Come on! Nancy! God wants it this way, Nancy! We're going to burn in hell, Nancy! You, me... and God! All of us together! You belong to me, not him... Not to anyone but me! "My father was an architect, a good and righteous man... My mother is an acrobat, and I do the best I can..." Hey pretty one. Hey, Pierre. I was wondering, if... Oh, he made it? I'm glad. Yeah, he made it. But the article says he'll probably never play again. A one-lunged saxophonist with a broken hand. Doesn't sound too hopeful, does it? - Did you ever hear him play? - Nah, I'm not too big on jazz... Give me Chuck Berry any day. I hear it's good. They says there's a big run on Katmandu's last CD. - Well that's good. - Good? I'd call it pretty ironic. The guy plays for years, nobody's ever heard of him. Then he gets shot, his career is ruined, suddenly he's a big success. Well, at least he's alive. I mean, you can't do anything unless you're alive. Celia, weren't you going to say something? Oh, I completely forgot. I have an audition next Tuesday... and I was hoping that I could work dinner instead of lunch. Arrange it with Bob or Helen. If they're not willing to switch, the answer's no. If they are, no problem. Okay. Fair enough. What's the part? It's a shampoo commercial. Are you the before or after? Probably neither. I don't think I'll get it. Of course you will. It's in the bag. Not enough hair. You're alive... Don't you ever forget that. You're alive. When you get out of here you'll be in reasonably good physical shape. It might take you a while to figure out your next move, but you start with life. And life is a beautiful thing, Mr. Maurer. No, it's not. Life is life, and it's only beautiful if you make it beautiful. I wish I could say I've done that, but I can't. The only beautiful thing I've ever done is play music. If I can't have that, I might as well be dead. Am I making myself clear? I'd rather have lost both my legs or both of my eyes than my left lung. A lung equals breath. Breath equals music. M usic equals life. Without music, I have no life. You talk like someone who feels he's been punished. Well, maybe I am. A madman fires a bullet into my body, and justice is finally done. Izzy... It's Dave again. Come on, man, don't do this to me. We gotta talk. You hear me? Don't be a schmuck, Izzy. J ust remember who your friends are, okay? Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Izzy... Pick up the damn phone. It's Hannah, for Chrissakes. Remember me? We used to be married. Back in the old days... When knights were brave and chicks were bold, and bullets weren't invented. Give me a call, Maurer, I want to know how you're doing. Hi, Izzy. Hey... Izzy? How're you doing? Bobby Perez. I did sound at your Summer Stage gig last year. We were all rooting for you, Izzy. I'm really glad you pulled through. Thanks, Billy. I'm doing much better now. I think I'm a lot younger than I was the last time you saw me. Wow. Yeah, yeah, probably. I see what you mean. And I forgot to put my watch on today. See? No watch. I consider that progress, real progress. Oh... It's you. You don't pick up your phone, so I figured I'd pay you a visit. You look nice in those pants. Don't even think about it, chum. It just brings back memories, that's all. That, plump, protruding little ass of yours. For a year or two, it was the most interesting place in the world for me. My ass and I are doing just fine without you, Izzy. You're not the only man who ever admired it, you know. So I gathered. You don't get a tan like that hanging around the city. So I guess this new boyfriend of yours is working out okay? We'll get to him later. We have other things to talk about first. Like what? Like you, dumbbell, that's what. I want to know what's happening to you. What for? I mean, you don't even like me. You still don't know who I am, do you? After all these years, you still don't have a clue. Apparently not. Once I give my heart to someone, it's forever. I may not want to live with you anymore, but that doesn't mean I don't care about you. You're still a part of who I am, you jerk. Hi. Excuse me if I'm in shock. - I didn't think you'd come. - You invited me, remember? - Hi. - Hi! This is Sonia. Philip's daughter. Are you Izzy Maurer? Well, I used to be. Who are you now? I don't know. Maybe nobody. Well, nice to meet you, Mr. Nobody. See you around. So, there's been a slight change of plans. Philip's working on a project with Catherine Moore... she's in New York for a few days, so we invited her to dinner too. The actress? Former actress. She's a director now. She hasn't acted for ten or 15 years. Catherine Moore... I used to have a crush on her. And the big hit of the summer was "The Reluctant Debutante", and I played the spotty debutante, and I was very thrilled because it was the only "young" part I had the whole season. All the rest, I was about 80 or 70 or something like that. So what made you give up acting? Vanity. Beauty fades... The flesh gives out. You lose interest in being someone else's idea about who you are. I didn't want to be invented by other people anymore. So now you invent yourself. Exactly. I'm the one that controls the images. But no one sees you. Oh well, so much the better. They see what I think. What they'll be seeing next is a new version of Pandora's Box. After a thousand bends in the road... we finally have a deal in place. All we need is someone to play Lulu. Who's Lulu? Lulu... As is Louise Brooks? As in the opera... The girl who eats men for breakfast. You know, the one who's done in by Jack the Ripper. You see what I mean, Philip? It's not at all obvious. People don't remember anything. Don't worry, Catherine... It's not all people, it's Izzy. Talk to him about anything but music and he acts like a little kid. Speaking of kids... Hi, sweetheart. - You getting tired? - Yeah. I came out to say goodnight. Do you want me to tuck you in? Is that okay? You don't mind, do you? Mind? Why should I mind? Okay... I will be back in a few minutes. Can I come too? - Of "cawse". This way, ladies. Cigar? No, thanks. Do you mind if I ask you a question? A question? Sure. Ask any question you want. You don't have to answer if you don't want to. But, something happened to me a couple weeks ago... and I'm still trying to figure out if I did the right thing or not. I was on a plane to London. I was going to see Catherine, as a matter of fact. J ust as we go into our descent, I decide I have to go to the toilet. I go down the aisle, but the door is locked, so I stand there, shooting the breeze with one of the stewardesses. Finally... the door opens... and out steps this good-looking girl. Maybe 24 or 25. Very pretty. She gives me an odd little look, she edges past me and I go into the bathroom. The toilet seat and the cover are both down, and sitting on top of the cover... is a huge turd. I have no idea what to do. If I complain to the stewardess she'll think I did it. We've just had this friendly conversation, and I don't want her to think I'm that kind of person. That's the situation. Now tell me what you would have done if you'd been me. I don't know... I would have complained, I guess, but, I'm not sure. What did you do? Took out some paper towels and I cleaned up the mess. Incredible. Yeah... Incredibly disgusting. I don't think I've ever done anything that generous. You did an admirable thing. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I was just being a coward. You know, I'm... trying to avoid a scene. Oof! Hello. - Who? - Izzy Maurer. You're kidding. Believe it or not, I'm... I'm listening to your record now. What's your name? My name? Well, how can you call me if you don't know my name? I have a napkin with your telephone number on it. You do? Celia... Burns. Celia Burns. Can I come over right away? I need to talk to you about something. All right... If it's that important. What's your address? 258 West 25th Street... Second floor. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Okay... I guess I'll see you then. Hello? - Celia? - It is you... I recognize you from your photograph. I thought, after I hung up, that maybe someone was playing a joke on me. No jokes. J ust one question. Do you know a man named Stanley Mar? Stanley Mar? M-A-R. I... don't think so. 35, 40... Wears nice suits. Shops for his ties at Barney's. I don't know. Maybe. You know there, there... I did go for a drink with someone named Stanley about a year ago... - but he didn't tell me his last name. - "Maybe"? What's this "maybe"? What's this? What the fuck is this? That's not my handwriting. Where did you get that? He had it on him. And you're going to stand there and tell me you saw him only once? If we're talking about the same Stanley, then yes. Now, I work in a restaurant... I served him dinner one night, and then he asked me out. I found him boring. All he did was talk about money. And what about this? I suppose you don't know anything about this, either. You know, I really like your music, and I'm very sorry about what happened to you, but... you know, you're acting like a crazy man and if you don't calm down, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You don't understand... What is that? - You tell me. - Me? Mar was carrying two things with him. The napkin with your number on it, and this. Well, it doesn't look like anything. Close the curtains. What? We have to make it dark in here. The darker the better. Now I don't like it when people order me around. J ust humor me. I'm not going to hurt you. You don't mean anything to me. Well that's pretty obvious, isn't it? I just have to show you this. Five minutes. And then I want you out of here. - Got it? - Okay. Now turn out the light. - Now watch. - I'm watching. J ust wait... - Oh, my God. - You see? It's beautiful. It's the most beautiful thing I've even seen. And Mar never said a thing to you about it? Shh! What are you doing? Be quiet. Don't touch it! Why not? Because... because we don't know what it is. Don't be silly. Of course I'm going to touch it. How could I not touch it? What does it feel like? I'm not going to tell you. I don't share secrets with cowards. I'm just not stupid, that's all. Oh, come on. Don't be afraid. It's the best thing. It really is. It's like nothing else. Ohh, Jesus... It's amazing, isn't it? You feel more alive, don't you? Yes. More connected. Connected to what? I don't know. To myself. To the table... The floor. The air in the room. To everything that's not me. To you. When I woke up this morning, I didn't know who you were. The way I'm feeling now, I could spend the rest of my life with you. I think I'd be willing to die for you. Don't. I'm sorry... I'm just telling you the truth. Do you know what it means to die for someone? It's not fair. Why not? Turn on the light. Please, turn on the light. I think I should go now. I'm sorry. I'll come back tomorrow. Yes... Come back tomorrow. Hey...! Hey... I have some shopping to do and I thought you might like to go with me. Sounds good. Eggs, oranges, those kinds of things. You can't live if you don't eat, right? Right. I don't even know who you are. Yes, you do. You know everything about me. Not really. But it doesn't matter, does it? No... As long as you don't... get up and leave now, I don't suppose it does. You don't see me rushing to get out of here, do you? Tell me something, Izzy... Are you... an ocean or a river? What? It's a game I used to play with my sister. You have to answer. An ocean or a river...? A river. Are you... a match or a cigarette lighter? A match. Definitely a match. Are you a car or a bicycle? A bicycle. Are you... an owl or a hummingbird? H mm... I used to be a hummingbird... But now I'm an owl. Are you sneakers or boots? That's not fair, you have to give me a chance now. - Sneakers or boots? - Boots. Now it's my turn. It's fun, isn't it? - We used to do it for hours. - Shh... you concentrate now. Are you a real person... or a spirit? A real person. Do you understand what's happened, or are you in the dark like me? In the dark. Are you in love, or just going along for the ride? In love. Are you with the person you love, or not with the person you love? With the person. With the person. There was a hole... right in the middle of his forehead. Like a... huge blind eye. I thought I was going to drown in it. Once I looked in there... I thought I would never get out. He must have been killed for the stone. Then why didn't they take it? Maybe something went wrong. I wish I could give it back. Back...? Back to who? To the person who owns it. I don't know... to the place where it belongs. - You know what it reminds me of? - What? The Berlin Wall. Not big enough. Remember when the wall came down in '89... There were little pieces of it floating around all over the place and a friend of mine was given one in Germany. It looked exactly the same, exactly like the thing that you found. A cruddy little chunk of cement. J ust like that. So you're saying that Russian scientists planted some... mysterious substance in the Berlin Wall? No, I'm just telling you what it reminds me of. I'll tell you what it reminds me of... a piece of some building you see on a New Jersey highway. You know, like a... bowling alley, or a warehouse, or maybe some fly-by-night topless bar. Why not? Celia? Say it again. Celia. I love hearing you say that. Say it again...? Celia... Yes? Are you happier on this roof or happier downstairs in bed? Oh, my God... I have to go to work. Why don't you call in sick? I can't. I really can't. I've only made $1200 as an actress this year. If I didn't have this job, I wouldn't eat. I don't want to let you out of my sight. Well, I mean, I'll be back at midnight. You could wait for me here, if you want. Maybe I could work with you. What do you mean? I don't know... Maybe they need another waiter or something. But you're a musician. Not anymore. My job is to be with you. You're my work now. Are you real... or did I make you up? Well? I could ask Pierre. Pierre? What is it, a French restaurant? No, it's kind of fake French. Sort of like Pierre... he's from the Bronx. There might be an opening for a busboy. I'd wash dishes if I had to. You'd better get dressed, then. - Wow! - That was the first part I ever got. It was about three years ago, when I first came to New York. "Horror Machine VI." Oh, watch this... This is a little bit that I did in "The Laughing Man". - H ubba, hubba. - Oh stop! Watch! Pow! Oh! That's terrible! Oh! Oh, no... Oh, no, now for some pure corn. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. - You don't want to hear this. - Yes I do. Oh, it's awful. No it's not. ...the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life... - She looks like she's already dead. - Shh! ...And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. This is something I did last year. That's me. Hey, sweetheart. Hey, that's Lou Reed. No, it's not. It just looks like him. What's your idea of fun, big guy? Well... I don't know. You tell me. It'll cost you 50 bucks to get me off this stool... You want me to walk through that door with you, it's gonna be another 50. The motel charges 75... and my rates start at a 120 per half hour. That's with my clothes on. You want me to take them off, it's another 50. Still interested? Yeah...! I'm interested. All right, be a good boy and go outside and wait for me. I want to finish my drink. Jesus, you're one tough cookie. I really liked doing that scene. Well, not much to show for myself so far. N un... whore, murder victim and a pie in the face? I'd say you're off to a pretty good start. Movies are tough. I've always had a lot better luck with plays. I got an agent two months ago. She put together this tape. Has it helped? Yes and no. I mean, I've had more auditions but, no work yet. I have another audition on Monday afternoon. What's the part? Lulu. There's going to be a new version of Pandora's Box. You're kidding...? No, it's really happening. They're looking for someone completely unknown. So, maybe I have a chance. It's such a great role, I'd love to play it. It's one of the best roles ever written for a woman. I know the people who are making that movie. Catherine Moore, she's the director, right? - Yeah... - And Philip Kleinman's the producer. You know them? Know them? I just had dinner with them a few nights ago. I'll call them up, put in a word for you... get the ball rolling. I'm going to get you that part. I just wanted to thank you, Hannah. You've been great. There she is. I'll catch you later. How did it go? I don't know... I don't think I was very good. It was a good experience... I got to talk to Catherine Moore. She's fantastic. You wouldn't be free later tonight, would you? Sorry, I'm busy. Have you decided on your orders yet? She's just playing hard-to-get, hm? We'd be happy to... make it worth your while. You know, the duck is very good tonight. The chef is recommending it. Fuck the duck. I'm interested in other kinds of meat. Hey, stupid. Keep your hands to yourself. Izzy, it's all right. I can handle it. Yeah, mind your own business, "busboy". Yeah, go and clear away some dirty dishes. This is my business, asshole. It's nothing. Believe me, it's nothing. Nothing? This schmuck! Starts feeling you up, and you call it nothing? Come on, get up, do it again! Do it again! - I dare you! - Stop! Stop it! Are you trying to ruin my business! Is that what you want? You're trying to destroy me! I'll kill you, you son-of-a-bitch! You hear me? I'll kill you! I never should've hired this maniac. I never should've let you talk me into it. Please, everyone, take your seats. I'm sorry for the disturbance, please. Please, gentlemen... return to your table. Dinner is on the house tonight, please! Paul, whatever they want. You, I want out of my sight. Get your things and leave. You're fired. Pierre, please, it won't happen again. You're damned right it won't. If he ever sets foot in my place again, I'll tear him apart. If he goes, I go. Then go. I don't care. You brought this bum in, you can take him out. How could you do that? I mean, do you know how much I needed that job? Two and half years I've been working there, and in one night you ruin everything. I mean, how could you do that? I'm sorry. That's how I used to be. All crazy and wild. I'm sorry. I don't want to be that person anymore. I swear to you, I'll never act that way again. Celia, are you there? It's Maggie. Well, I have just had two calls... One from Philip Kleinman, one from Catherine Moore, and you've got the part. You're the one they want. It's fantastic. Call me tomorrow morning, and I'll fill you in on the details. Congratulations, darling. I'm just over the moon for you. Are you all right? I got the part. I'm Lulu. "We are all lost creatures," he said... "and it is only if we admit this that we have any chance of finding ourselves". But Lulu doesn't admit anything. She doesn't know anything. She just is. Wedekind says Lulu isn't a real character... she's... an embodiment of primitive sexuality. And whatever evil she causes comes about by accident, because she's passive, because she's playing a passive role. I don't agree... She's impulsive, but she's not a destroyer. She doesn't care what other people think of her. That's where she gets her power. She doesn't have any pretensions... She doesn't play by the same rules everyone else does. But Wedekind wrote the play. He created her. It doesn't matter. He was wrong. He was wrong? Well, we'll see. So, Izzy... I hear you'll be hanging around Dublin with us. H uh? Yes, he's... going to come over a few days after I do. Yeah. I'm getting rid of my apartment, putting my things in storage. When the movie's over... Celia and I are going to look for a new apartment together. Sounds cozy. It will be. That's exactly what I wanted. Thanks a million. Bye-bye. - Everything okay? - Everything's great. Catherine... You talk to Otts about using bigger speakers for the rock 'n' roll scene? Oh, he's taking care of it. I still haven't figured out how to light it, though. Well, we'll be there the day after tomorrow... Meet me downstairs. I need to talk to you about something. Would you please excuse me for a minute? The car is here. I wish you were going with me now. It's better this way. You can settle in... I'll take care of things here. It's just a few days. I don't want to let you out of my sight. I need you with me. You're going to knock their socks off. I love you, Izzy. What did I do to deserve you? You're my angel, Celia. My miracle. My whole life. Here... take this. Maybe it will help. What for? Whenever you look at it, you'll think about me. And what about you? Aren't you going to think about me? I don't need the stone to think about you. I'll be thinking about you every minute. Oof! You're a slippery fellow, Mr. Maurer. Don't you like your apartment anymore? Who are you? What do you want? No, Mr. Maurer, who are you, and what do you want? What gives the right to meddle in our business? - Again, boss? - Absolutely. Who are you working for? Why did you kill Stanley Mar? I didn't kill him. It's too late for lies, my friend. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Izzy... Aw, I've missed you again. I'll be in tonight, so you can call me when you get back. Everything is fine here, but I just miss you so much, I can't wait to see you. Only three days. Only! It feels like forever. Well, I love you, Izzy. And I kiss you and... I send you a thousand hugs. Okay, my darling. Bye. Hello, Mr. Maurer. I'm Dr. Van Horn. I can go now, right? I mean... you're the good guys, aren't you? Isn't that what happened? - The good guys got rid of the bad guys? - Yes... We're the good guys. I want to go home. You will, I promise you. But we have to talk first. It's very important. I don't believe you. It doesn't smell very good in here, does it? A man has... got to shit. If he doesn't have a toilet, what do you expect? Montaigne once wrote, "Let us not forget that philosophers and kings, and even ladies, too, must defecate". - Well? - Don't worry... I'll have it cleaned up. You must be hungry. When was the last time you ate? I don't want food... I just want to get out of here. We're the good guys, Mr. Maurer, I can assure you of that. But what I want to know, is whether you're good, too. Are you good, Mr. Maurer? Are you worthy? Worthy? Of what? I thought you could help us, you see. I had such high hopes for you. But I was wrong to trust you, wasn't I? Am I right or wrong, Mr. Maurer? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yes, you do. Stanley Mar, for one thing. And a little box he was carrying with him. Do you know how precious that stone is? It took years to achieve that light. Do you have any idea of the good it can do? I'm so disappointed in you. Here. Change your clothes. You stink. Cut! I'd like to print that one. But I want to have another go. J ust give me a few minutes. It's still a little too broad. I was trying to hold back, but it's such an emotional scene. I know. It's all so over the top, but... It's about real things. Things that are hidden maybe, but... Things that are there. You don't have to work so hard, Celia. Let the camera do it for you. It's like, turning dreams inside out, isn't it? We have all them in us. It's just a matter of how you let them go. Thank you. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Izzy darling, where are you? They sent someone to the airport this morning to pick you up... and you weren't there. Oh, my sweetheart, where are you? What happened to you? Are you there? I don't have it. I told you that before... I don't have it. And I don't know where it is. When did you start using the name Izzy? This is ridiculous. Your real name's Isaac, isn't it? - So? - How old were you? Six? Eight? 14? I don't remember. But you do remember the fireflies, don't you? - The what? - Maybe you called them "lightning bugs". It doesn't matter. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? No. Those little things that fly around at night... in the summer, when the weather's hot. Tiny pinpricks of light, going on and off, darting through the air, now in one place, now in another. Very beautiful, no? What is this, "Welcome to the World of Insects"? No. It's called, going back or delving into the past. Remember Echo Lake? How many summers did you and your family go there? - How do you know about that? - I know about a lot of things. Do you remember the fireflies now? Yes... Vaguely. Yes, I remember them. You and your big brother would go out in the backyard at night, wouldn't you? Carrying jars with little holes punched in the top. What was his name again? - Franz. - Franz, right, that's it. Franz and Isaac. How many years apart were you? - Three... - Right. Three. Three years apart. So you and your big brother, Franz, who was three years older than you would go out at night to catch fireflies in the backyard. Your father punched the holes in the tops of the jars, didn't he? With a hammer and an eighth-inch nail. Tap, tap, tap. He was a doctor, your father, wasn't he? Not a pretend doctor like me, with my Ph.D. in anthropology but an honest-to-goodness medical doctor who actually cures the sick, and helps people get well. Stocky fellow, wasn't he? With strong upper arms, and one of those barrel chests. Bald, too, if I'm not mistaken... and even out there at the lake in the summer... when he had his one measly week of holiday a year... he walked around in his white shirt, didn't he? No tie... he'd roll his sleeves up when the weather was particularly hot, but still that's how you see him in your mind, isn't it? Your father in his white shirt. Stop it... Don't do this to me. So there you'd be, you and Franz, running around the backyard of the house by Echo Lake trying to catch fireflies and put them in your jars. It was so magnificent, holding that jar in your hand with all those flickering lights inside. And of course the more fireflies you caught and put in the jar... the more impressive and beautiful the lantern would be. The problem was you weren't very good at catching fireflies. Everytime you reached out for one, it would suddenly go dark and then another would light up somewhere else, distracting you from the first one just long enough to lose track of where it was, and then you would go after the second one and the same thing would happen all over again. And again, and again. Meanwhile, your big brother, Franz, who was three years older than you, would be snaring one incandescent bug after another. His jar would be glowing like a small temple of dreams. And again and again you would come up empty-handed. It drove you into spasms of frustration. Finally, in your sniveling, abject little way, you'd resort to tears, raising such a fuss that your mother would have to come running outside. Your poor mother who was spending a few tranquil moments with your father drinking his one nightly beer in his white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and nine times out of ten she would settle things by forcing a reluctant Franz to part with a few of his fireflies, so you would have something to put in your jar, too. Anything to keep the brat quiet. Right, Izzy? Anything for a few moments of peace. What kind of a man are you? When's the last time you saw Franz? I don't want to talk about this. Answer the question. You have to answer the question. - I don't know. - Seven years ago, that's when. He asked you to play at your father's funeral and you refused. Why did you do a thing like that? Who the hell do you think you are? Your brother hates you so much he didn't even bother to visit you in the hospital after you were shot. You've burned a lot of bridges in your day, haven't you? All right, that was good. Let's do it one more time. J ust to be sure we've got the blocking down. Remember, Tom, scene begins, the door swings open... "I want, don't want to go"... "You're not going anywhere," "I want to go"... "You're not going anywhere." ...Shove, Celia's thrown onto the bed... then, remember if you stop here, on the mark, because it is simpler for you to go to the bureau... where you get out the gun. Ah, where's the gun? The gun... The gun. And Billy, Mark will give you a signal when you have to knock on the door. And it's right after Tom says, "Do what you have to do, do it now." Okay? Everything clear? - All right... - Quiet! Lock it up... Scene three, take one, mark. Ah... This little piece of nastiness interests me. December fourth, six years ago... The Paradise Lounge, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You and your band performed there that night, didn't you? Do you remember a man named Jack Bartholomew? - We settled out of court. - I know that. But you didn't have to break his arm, did you? The guy stiffed us. He begs us to play his lousy club in Milwaukee... in the middle of the goddamn winter and the night we go on there's a snowstorm and nobody shows up. So the son-of-a-bitch decides not to pay us. We hardly had enough money to get back to New York. So I lost my temper. You loved playing with that band, didn't you? It was my whole life. You shouldn't have given up music, Izzy. I didn't. It gave me up. I got shot, remember? I'm tired of this. I don't want to be here anymore. What else to you care about, Izzy? Besides yourself, that is. Care? What do you mean care? I don't know... Collecting stamps, French wine... Astrology. I'm not interested in these questions. Come on, Izzy. Indulge me. Women... Women's bodies. - Having sex with women. - Good. What else? Nothing. Besides music, that's it. What's your favorite book? I don't have a favorite book. What's your favorite movie? I don't like the movies. I never go to them. I thought every American loved the movies. Not me... I used to go when I was a kid. But then Gene Kelly retired, and the joy kind of went out of it for me. He's dead now, you know. You're not pulling my leg, are you? You really like Gene Kelly? Yeah... As a matter of fact, I do. Which film? - Which song? - I don't know. Most of them, I guess. But my favorite number would have to be "Singin' in the Rain". - I never get tired of it. - For once I agree with you... I love it, too. In fact I would even go so far as to say it's one of the finest, most beautiful things ever created by an American. As good as the Declaration of Independence. As good as Moby Dick. Shit... It's better than that stuff. "Singin' in the Rain" is forever. "I'm singing in the rain... just singing in the rain... What a glorious feeling, I'm... happy again." If you want, I'll call New York in the morning. I'll get someone to start looking for him. Thank you. Tomorrow's Sunday. What are you going to do with yourself? I don't know. I haven't been able to think that far ahead. Don't sit around and sulk. You promise me that? We've got some very demanding scenes on Monday and Tuesday... and you need a clear head. I'll be all right. Love affairs come and go... but the work is what lasts. You know that, don't you? No... I don't think I do. I don't think I know anything. Come here, Izzy. - Don't you ever sleep? - We don't have much time. Sit. - Is something wrong? - Everything's wrong. Because of you. And I thought you were beginning to like me. - Silly me. - I was... But feelings have nothing to do with this. - I can't trust you. - Look, I'm not stupid... You know too much about me for me to lie to you. You're not worthy. You've led a bad, dishonest life. I'm not going to argue with you. But then I got shot. You'd think that would be the worst thing that could have happened to me. But it wasn't. I've changed since then. I've let go of my rottenness. A new man...? Maybe. I don't know what to call it. But I feel more connected to things now. More connected to other people. Responsible, somehow. Then why haven't you helped me? Why haven't you told me about Celia Burns? - Who? - You heard me. - I don't know that person... - I could have you killed, you know. All I have to do is bang on the door, and a man will come in here with a gun and put a bullet through your head. Been there, done that. - Sounds like the old Izzy to me. - Well, habits die hard. If you'd told me right away... the whole situation could have been saved. But now it's probably too late. What if I told you this is your one chance to do some good in the world? Tell me about her, Izzy, and I'll let you go. I'll unlock the door and you'll be free. I wish I could but I don't know this person you're talking about. Of course you do! You're in love with her! I am? That's it. I have nothing more to say to you. You won't be seeing me again. And without me, you're lost. May God have mercy on your soul. What happened to you, Izzy? Where are you? Help me! Please! Someone...! Help me! - Celia Burns? - Yes? May I have a word with you, please? I'm sorry. I have to be at the set in 15 minutes. It's about Izzy Maurer. He wants to see you. Izzy? - You know where he is? - I do. If you come with me now, I can take you right to him. Okay. Oh, they're expecting me. Can I call them first? I don't want them to worry. There's a phone in the car. Who are they? Don't worry. They're with me. Come. I get it... I know what you want now. It's in here. J ust go! Don't do it, miss... We're not going to hurt you. It's a disaster. The worst thing I've ever lived through. 12 days of shooting, and on the 13th day... she doesn't show up. We had to shut down and send everyone home. The insurance company has three detectives looking for her... and not one of them has found a lead. Nothing. Not even a whiff. I should have been there with her... I never should have waited. To tell you the truth, I still have trouble believing what happened. The whole thing's like a dream, like she was never really there. Was she good? Better than good. She was extraordinary. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm all right. - Do you want a doctor? - No. I'm all right. I almost forgot... You should have one of these. The editor put together a rough cut of the scenes we shot, and I had them transferred to video. Keep it. Thanks. Go home, Izzy. You don't look so good. You need some rest, okay? Okay. I'll call you if I hear anything. You don't believe me, do you? Sure, we believe you, Izzy. Why shouldn't we believe you? Tell me... Am I a stone or a tree? What? J ust answer the question. Am I a stone or a tree? - A stone. - A tree. Am I a dog or a bird? You're both, man... You're a dog with wings. Am I a good person or a bad person? Izzy, cut it out... You're going to drive yourself crazy. You're good, Iz... You're good with some bad stuff mixed in. J ust like everyone else. Am I here... or not here? What difference does it make? Life is just an illusion anyway, right? Don't worry about it. Help! Somebody help me! Help me! Help me!! He's gone. We lost him. Cut the siren, Frank. The guy's dead.
