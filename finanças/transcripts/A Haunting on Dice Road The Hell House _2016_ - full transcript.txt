We've been here... Been 38 years. We bought it in 1978. - Went by and saw the for sale sign, and decided to take a look at it. - I know when we first went by it, I recall it being the haunted house. - Louann still has a high school friend that was divorced and dating a gentleman that was a part-time policeman with the Saginaw County Sheriff Department, and we went fishin' one day, just on a whim and a prayer on the way home I said, "Hey, maybe next weekend or so, "we could have you guys over to our house for a barbecue." And he said, "No." Okay, what do you mean, no? He says, "I'm not going to your house." I said, "What do you mean, not going to my house?" That's all I'm sayin'. Said "I will not go to your house." And come to find out he had been here, through the county sheriff department. So that threw up a red flag. Well, something apparently had gone on here. - I know my granddaughter and my grandson they were here and happened to see a flash of light that went by. She thought it was kind of bluish yellow, I think it was. That's one thing recently that she told me about, then my other two daughters, they mentioned a few things to us recently, but at the time I don't recall them telling us about it. - My parents went out to dinner, and we were here alone, and we were sitting in the main living room. We saw a flash outside and then our dog started barking, got up on the bay window and started barking, and then we looked and some guy put his head up into the window and peaked in like this. - It was like a white face. - Yeah. - It was literally like a glow. I mean, you couldn't really see much of anything except for a round white head with his hands like this. - So we came running into the other room, and Bridgette called our neighbor, and it was snowing and there was no footprints or anything. There was nothing. What did you know, whether it'd be a little or a lot about the past of this home? - I knew a little growing up, but as I got older we heard much more. Things that would scare us, but we didn't know if it was true, it was just rumors, hearsay, and then my Dad had an article that he showed us, and we read that and that's when it really spooked me. - I was sleeping one night, and I was woken up by like a flash. As soon as opened my eyes, my dog was at the end of the bed, growling at nothin'. - Back in February, my daughter, who's 11, had a same experience. She saw a flash of light go through. There was no lights on, and she just seen it just kind of go by her eyes. I would like some answers and some clarity to it, because it's always in the back of my mind now and that my kids are here quite often and now they're questioning things, you know, and a little bit scared. To comprehend the magnitude of these events, you'd have to know the whole story, how it all began. - Hi, I'm Terry Pomeraning, son of Harold and Mabel Pomeraning. My parents built this house back in 1951, had their first child in 1953, my brother Duanne, and I was born in 1955. Been livin' here out in the country, it was just the best. Started helpin' my Dad, my grandpa on the farm when I was eight years old. Closest neighbor is maybe a quarter, half mile from ya. My parents lived here for 20 years. My brother 19, myself 17 years, we never ever had any problems in this house. What was your first encounter with the Pomeranings? - Now we have to go back about, I'm thinkin' 40 years. The first call I got was prowlers. Went on a prowler call. Mr. Pomeraning, we got to know him very well, and we called him Harold. He knew us and later on he didn't call us such pleasant names because we couldn't solve what his problem was. Harold would tell us that as soon as he would come home, noises would start. There would be pounding on the walls outside. We would check the exterior of the house, we'd find nothing, no damage to the house. We would check for footprints and other evidence of someone prowling around, but we could never locate anything. Had you known Harold Pomeraning or any of the Pomeranings prior to this event? - You knew everybody in this community. Yes. You didn't maybe know him personally, 'cause I don't have a cup of coffee with everyone of 'em, but you knew everybody, you knew their name, you knew who they looked like. They were, he was a shop worker, and very cordial and down to earth people. - They came over to our house quite a bit. They always come over to the kids' birthday party, and like I said, she'd bring baked goods over and stuff like that, but after it all got really bad, I was too scared to come over. - The second contact I had with Mr. Pomeraning, I was going to position myself not too far from his house, and wait to see if he called. That was about a half a mile, and sure enough I got dispatched to his house. I hit it with my spotlights, and I saw absolutely nothing. Dispatch kept saying it. Was someone still beating on his house? And I'm saying I'm right in front of the house, and I see absolutely nothing, so just tell him I'm out and I'm gonna be right in there. Well, the minute that I pulled into his driveway, he had an outside light. Well, the light went out, but as the light went out I heard some noise, so when I got out of the car and I looked at it, it was not only out, but it had exploded, and the noise I heard was shrapnel from the glass hitting my car. I went in and talked to Mr. Pomeraning. He said, "Well, you better go check." He was very adamant that I go outside and check. I said, "Well, you wanna come with me?" He said, "No, I don't wanna go out there." I said, "Well, okay." I go out and I walked all the way around the house and I saw no evidence whatsoever of anyone that would be walking through his yard or around his house. So I went back in and talked to him again. And just before I left, a picture on the wall actually dropped down, straight down. I looked at the picture frame. The holder was still intact, and the holder on the wall was still intact. I don't know what made it drop and just slide down, but it did. I can attest to that. I will swear to that. - Right now I'm in the kitchen of the Dice Road residence, and one could say that the entire case started right here. This cutout to my left was once a window overlooking the backyard, and obviously the family room here is an addition. And, late one night while the Pomeranings were fast asleep, it was midnight or one o'clock in the morning. There was a pounding at this window. The pounding was so hard it actually shattered the glass, the glass dumping here into the sink. Harold sprung out of bed, grabbed his shotgun, and began clearing the home thinking somebody must've broken in. Well, needless to say, nobody actually broke in. The Saginaw County sheriff's department came, investigated and filed the report. The family had no idea that from that day forward, every single night the police would be called, that the pounding would continue and reach epic proportions. What really came in that window was actually an evil to the likes in which this community has never seen. It wasn't long before we had captured our first piece of evidence on camera. A radio in the kitchen had unexplainably turned on by itself. - The family was complaining about knockings or loud noises as if somebody was hitting the side of the house with baseball bat. - It was more of just a banging noise. You know, just a... Oh, somebody had taken a tub upside down and hit it with a wooden stick or something like that, just a bang. - You knock. Harder. It was like, it was going every five minutes, but even 10 times harder. That's what it sounded like. Just a boom boom boom. - You could hear it but you couldn't see anybody. - If it would been somebody inside, the drywall would have been broke. - The activities that I performed while I was here was to to do a thorough search for any electrical device, noise-making device, something that would cause the pounding or the appearance of pounding through sound. We'd find no wires, no devices, and had to conclude that there was no physical evidence present. What was that like for you? I mean, wondering who was outside, why they were doing it. - It was scary, really. I mean, just the thought of, once it gets dark, you know, it's gonna start up tonight again. - So right now we're on the east end of the property here at Dice Road. This is the original aluminum siding from the house when it was built in 1951, and what's really interesting, if you go off the infrared and turn on your standard color there, you can see dents still remaining here on the aluminum siding. So, whatever was pounding on the house had enormous strength, and even more bizarre, was never detected. Prior to starting the investigation, Terry Pomeraning had given us a tour of his childhood home, recalling the numerous incidents in great detail. Upon entering the kitchen, he explained that the faucet would often turn on by itself. - Every night when the pounding would start, my Dad still called the Saginaw County sheriff department. They came out every night, some nights multiple times they'd come out and never see nothin'. - It was gettin' to a point where a lot of guys didn't even wanna go out there. It was the same thing over and over. You could have probably at one time taken one report, and every time you went out there, ran it on a copy machine, turned it in, it'd be the same thing. This is a report that myself Deputy Duanne Graham, who is now deceased, took 9-9 of 1974 at 12:44 in the morning. Mr. Pomeraning had called the sheriff's department and stated that he had heard someone walking around outside his house, and that someone was beating on the side of his house. He reported this has been happening for sometime, and he's beginning to wonder why this department has failed to catch someone. The area was checked with no signs of persons being around the house or in the area could be found. Same thing happened on 9-1, same thing, somebody beatin' on the house. They checked, they could find nothing. 9-10, the next night, same thing. A report someone was beating on his door, and this time these officers did hear a thumping noise near the house, and they hit the house with spotlights and there was nothing. 9-13, three days later, same thing. Complaints say someone was banging on the house, area was checked, nothing found. 9-14, next night, same thing. - They were gettin' very irritated. My Dad was upset with the sheriff's department. It was just gettin' on everybody's nerves really. - This is Tim conducting an EVP session in the dining room. Have you been here longer than this house on this land? Is there something about this land in particular that draws you to it? Was it your land? Be careful. Look at that. Black pellet powder. Dangerous. They used to make their own ammunition back then. It's interesting just how things have changed. A super heavy feeling in here. Wow. Look at that structural damage. We have to really, really be careful. - Were you mad that Harold built a house on this land? Is that why you tormented them for so long? How long have you been here? - That's about to give. Residents in the area claim to see dark shadowy figures emerging from this barn at night. Are you perhaps one of the original family members who bought this land? Got a creepy old desk there. This way, go this way. I was surprised to hear footsteps coming from the old hayloft above. You can actually see dust and debris falling all around me as the heavy steps occurred. Due to the severe structural damage, I was unable to investigate the hayloft. Instead, I placed infrared cameras all around the perimeter in an attempt to capture whatever had been lurking in the old barn. - When Steven first reached out to me and made contact I was pretty lerry, but after speaking with him, I did agree to meet, but at that time I still wasn't willing to share this story. My name is Mark and I served 23 years in law enforcement and am currently a retired homicide detective. When I was 12 years old, my father worked with Harold. They worked in the Midland area. My father basically came home one night and said that a man that he new down at work was having some problems with his house. The gentlemen asked him to come over to the house and see if he could explain some of the things that were goin' on. So, naturally as a 12-year old boy, I became very interested in it, and thought, well, what's wrong with the house? Is it haunted? Well, my father didn't know. In fact, he said that Harold did not really believe in ghosts, and he thought it was something that he could explain. When we arrived at the house, I remember Harold coming out one of the side doors. There was a doberman pincher that he had. My father asked Harold is the dog okay. The dog was okay now, but at one time it could be aggressive. One night he heard something knocking on the outside of his house, and he let the dog out and it ran around the house, and it was barking like there was something out there, and he said it sounded like the dog was getting beat. It's never really been the same since. From there, my father and him basically would discuss certain, I guess you would call them theories. I remember at one point during their conversations, he produced a set of tapes, and I remember him playing those tapes for my father, and you could hear the pounding. I also recall that as the evening wore on I could sense that Harold was becoming, I guess the word you would want to use was embarrassed, because according to him this took place many times in a day. It was like he was absolutely sure that when we came over, that we would hear these sounds, and as the evening wore on, nothing ever happened. He was embarrassed to the point at this time that he was actually raising his fist, and kind of like talking to whatever was there and saying, come on you son of a, you know, show yourself. That's when something did happen, is unexplainable. Right on the side wall of the kitchen, just massive poundings. It just bam bam bam. There was, what I recall, two plates on that wall, and that wall, whatever was hitting it, it hit so hard that those plates just started bouncing along that wall, and I'll never forget looking over and seeing those plates bounce. And immediately after that sound happened, Harold immediately yelled out, "See, I told you. "Now explain that to me. "You tell me what that sound is." Well, five maybe 10 minutes later, the very loud poundings in the ceiling of the kitchen, not quite as loud, more of a rumbling, like something was just rumbling through the ceiling of the kitchen. Everybody in the house was accounted for. That was pretty much my experience at the house. This is where something happened to our family. Probably around a half hour after we got home, I was downstairs and we had a downstairs door at the time, I was probably five feet away from that door, now this is probably around midnight at that time, and all of a sudden I hear three knocks on the door. Opened it up, there's nobody there. Those knocks on our door happened three times in probably a five or six day period. Our family took that as I guess you would call it a warning. You may not wanna become involved in something that you shouldn't. So, we never did go back to the house. - Up here, Harold's wife Mable would collect fine china and antique plates, and she proudly displayed them right here. Eye witnesses in sheriff's office, deputies who investigated this case would claim that when the pounding would occur, the plates would actually sway right off the wall in conjunction, that the pounding had that much power. Now, when one thing's pounding, naturally, you think a fist pounding on the wall, but the pounding was actually much more powerful than what it sounds to be. Another instance, actually, back over here, is at the knife block. Terry Pomeraning stated to us that a knife actually came out of the knife block... Jesus Christ. Come here, come here. Did you get that? Look. What the... It seemed as though whatever was inhabiting the home was growing tired of our intrusion and gaining in strength. Perhaps worse things were yet to come if we did not leave. - My name's Tim Everett. Mabel Pomeraning was my aunt. She was my Mom's older sister. My aunt was a special woman. She would've given you the shirt off her back. She dropped out of high school in the 11th grade to go and work to help support the family. She met my uncle Harold at a dance, I believe. They dated for a while and I remember their wedding. I was the ring bearer, so you can tell it was many years ago that they got married. They were farmers. That was a new lifestyle for her because she was a city girl. Harold was a hard worker. He worked nights at Dow Chemi Co, and would come home in the day time, would take care of the farm. Terry, you would see right along with his Dad. He had a very normal existence in the house until what happened happened, you know, when it began, and then everything changed. Their lives changed, the house changed, everything just became hell. She never, never deserved to have this happen to her and her family. - The number of man hours attributed to this case is immeasurable, it's immense. I never saw this much investigation done on a homicide. Myself and another deputy staked the house out, and it was raining that night, I remember it was raining, and all of a sudden we did hear some banging. And my partner says, well, I'm gonna go this way, you go that way, and whatever it is, we're gonna go 'im. So I went to the west side of the house, my partner went to the east side of the house. Well, the noise came, and I yelled to my partner. He said I heard it, but I don't see anything. So again, we checked, it had been raining, there was dampness on the ground. There was rain and the grass was wet. There was absolutely nothing there that would indicate anyone had been walking around the side of that house. - I recall being in the car one night and was listening to the radio traffic. It was a quiet, quiet night, just driving around town. I heard one of the officers from Saginaw County sheriff's department. He was telling his officers to surround this house, and then I heard him say the noises are starting to happen. - We got a radio call from inside the house where Captain McGall was, and said there was pounding on the front door, is anyone at the front door. I did not hear the pounding. You could hear it from his radio being transmitted through his radio into my radio. We reported back, no, there is no one at that front door. We had the other officers check in, and they indicated as well there's no one around that house. - Sheriff's deputies were out there all armed, and they couldn't help us. They all came up to our house and about 10 minutes later, and they were all very upset. There's gotta be someone inside the house, one deputy said, that's doing this, because there was no one out there, and that's when my Ma got into it with him. They just came to a conclusion it had to be someone inside the house. It was hard livin' that way, knowin' that you're being watched every second. - So right now we're about to head up these stairs to investigate the... Hey, is anybody investigating outside right now? - Negative. I was just about to head up to the loft. Up in the command center with Eddie. All right, well, I was walking through the house here, and could've swore I saw someone looking through the windows and standing there. I took a double take and it was gone. - You sure it couldn't have been a reflection or possibly a car goin' by? I'm positive, my flashlight wasn't even on. I know what I saw. Do you want me to stop my investigation and go take a look? - Negative. We're about to head outside and take a look. Copy that. One of the infrared cameras placed in the kitchen had actually recorded the incident. Perhaps this validates the claims from a current family who inhabits the home and their sightings of the strange phenomenon. - A round white head with his hands like this. Josh, come in. Copy. - I didn't see anybody, I definitely heard somethin'. The back yard's completely fenced in, but we have a ladder just sittin' right up against it for easy access. Copy that. - I wanna get cameras on all the windows and all the doors immediately. All right, I'll get right on that. - Take a look down here. Switch it off, see if we can try to document any footprints. I don't see anything. Definitely heard what sounded like somebody hittin' this fence or something in this vicinity. It's kind of eerie when you think about it because I recall the family's daughters talking about an instance where they saw somebody peaking in, described it as an all white face, just glowing white, and I remember reading a police report from 1974 from the original family, almost saying the exact same thing. - There has been knocking on the Pomeraning house since July 19th, 1974. The Saginaw County sheriff's department has been called to the house at least 35 times. - So now you've got a lot of pressure coming down on the department. - We did do some fingerprint dusting, but nothing to identify someone other than the family. - So we kind of had him high up on our list of suspects. - Terry Pomeraning, the 18-year old son of the Pomeranings is listed as a suspect. - He just gave me the impression that he knew more about what was going on in the house and what was coming out. - They had me there then for about four hours doing polygraph. They would do trick questions. You know, they'd ask a lot of the same questions but they'd word it a little bit different each time. It is the opinion of the polygraphist that Terry Pomeraning is telling the truth when he denies being the one that is causing the knocking at the Pomeraning home. I passed that with flying colors. Then later on the whole family had to take polygraphs and everyone passed. - This is the other side of the fence here where that ladder was leaned up, and now that I'm over here it's really bizarre 'cause take a look at this. You got this cooler here with this flat surface just sitting here, almost as if somebody could just step up on it to get over this fence, and then climb down that ladder and come out the other way. Now, if somebody wanted to sneak up on the house here and get into the backyard, this would be the perfect place, because number one, it's the darkest portion of the property and you got nothin' back here but farm field and the old barn. Kind of interesting when you think about those police reports. That's the path that they thought the prowler would choose, would be coming back here from that corn field and sneaking up to this part of the house, because they would say the eastern back of the property is where the pounding would happen the most frequently. Matter of fact, police brought their most vicious police dog out here. I think his name was fury, and they tied him to a tree that used to be right here, and they thought, well, when that guy comes up to pound on the side of the house, he'll have a hell of a surprise. Interesting enough, the pounding continued every night that dog was here, which was nearly a week, and that dog never even so much as barked. I thought I heard somethin', I'm not sure. We're gonna have to get cameras set up here. If somebody is indeed prowling around the property though, we need to inform the owners, because I don't know why anybody would wanna be doin' that out here. Being in a rural area like that, better be careful whose fence you jump. It's a good way to get yourself shot. The following video contains extraordinary evidence, a spirit orb physically interacting with its surroundings. Notice how the freezer door is actually pulled open just before orb can be seen, turning the corner and entering in the living room, ultimately disappearing into the wall. Perhaps this validates the claims from the current family who inhabits the home and their sightings of the strange phenomenon. - She saw a flash of light go through. There was no lights on and she just seen it just kind of go by your eyes. - After my parents realized that police couldn't really protect us, we were seeking help from our pastor. He wouldn't even come to the house, he was afraid. Then my Ma and Dad turned to the Catholic priest the night's after he had blessed our home. I mean, it just got really bad. They were just mad at what he did, you know, throwin' that holy water all around the house, outside and inside. Made matters worst. - I'm about to read to you from a Michigan state police report written on February 13th, 1975. During the investigation of these complaints, the following departments and private organizations and/or individuals participated in, and to this writer's knowledge have no satisfactory answer as to the strange occurrences and phenomenon taking place at the private residence at Dice Road. Michigan state police. Michigan state police fire marshal division. MSP intelligence technical service unit. The Saginaw County sheriff's department. Merrill police department. The Jonesfield Lakefield township fire department. Duke University. The Michigan department of health. Michigan state police polygraph examination unit. Michigan Bell telephone company. Consumer's Power company. Federal aviation agency. The tri city airport. Several churches and clergy members from the area. Still waiting data. One thing I do wanna note is that when we spoke to the surviving members of the Pomeraning family, they told us that when the churches would come out here, they dreaded that because they knew that as soon as those people left, the activity in the house would just go through the roof, that the pounding would be twice as bad, and last twice as long. We're not sure why that would be. We do know that Mabel and Harold did try to locate somebody to perform an exorcism as they believe that what inhabited this home were demonic entities. To our knowledge, that never took place. An exorcism was never actually done on the home. - Harold had recalled something. A lady come on over to the house one day and inquired about possibly buying his property, that she was interested in his property and the house. - And my Dad said, I ain't sellin', you know, we're not gonna sell our house. Why would you wanna buy our house when you got a brand new home across the road. - A couple months later she came back. At this time she seemed a little bit more forceful in her desire to have the property. - She was just adamant that she wanted our house in the worse way. - And I guess there was some type of argument between her and Harold. But Harold told my father that he always thought that she may have been responsible and did something to the house. - Then shortly after, we started having a lot of problems. - She did tell me that was an ordained witch. She in fact told you she was a witch? Yes, she did. That she practiced witchcraft? That's what she said at the time. She was seen several times coming out of the Dice Road cemetery at odd hours of the night. - I can't remember the gal's name who was doin' it, but that was the only time we ever heard of the witchcraft in this area. The witch had occult symbols on our house. Can you tell us about that? - Three big black Xs above the garage door. I don't know what they mean or whatever, but it was awfully strange. And can you tell us what you were told about what the symbols meant? - The symbol meant from the Catholic priest that came out there that it was a sign of the devil. It was evil worshipers. - They was weird things goin' on over there. Dances, things in the window that people saw. So I didn't wanna have anything more to do with her because if she was the one that was doing stuff in this house, then I would be next. - By the front door there was a plate hangin' on the wall, and all of a sudden it started to ding ding ding just like a bell ringing, so I reached up and I touched it and it quit ringin'. And I took my hand off it, and started, like somebody was hittin' it with their fingernail. You know, ding ding ding ding. We looked across the road and this gal was out dancin' around her bush out there in her yard, and what the heck's goin' on? You know, just about that time there was a fairly loud noise, and the living room ceiling cracked the full length of east to west. Just a big crack in the living room ceiling, and then she quit dancin'. Obviously, I believed it. After going through it, I believe there was witchcraft there. Do you think they were targeting anybody specifically in your family? - There was me. I think I was the one. - She met up with Duane at the corner here to get the newspaper that one day, and Duane had never talked to the people, didn't really want nothin' to do with them, 'cause he thought they were strange from the start. She coaxed him over there, and he was in their house for like three hours that afternoon. He came back home and just started acting a little funny then, like something wasn't right. He just passed right out and almost died. - And I had a grand mal seizure. It was pretty bad. I had to do a tracheotomy, but she made sure that she cut my hair. The use of one's hair in ritual is often found in the dark arts, particularly witchcraft. Duane Pomeraning stated he remembered very little of the hours spent inside the witch's home. He recalled the house being filled with candles and strange symbols, and at one point, she cut a lock of his hair. - The attic comes into play multiple times through the investigation in 1974 and 1975, where eyewitnesses reported hearing strange rumbling, loud cracks and bangs coming from this portion of the home. So, Eddie's gonna go ahead and place an infrared camera up there, and we're just gonna let that roll all night, as well as a digital recorder, and the goal is to capture any data that we can during the investigation. I'll hold the ladder for ya. We're not sure how it sounded... Whoa whoa! Are you okay? Eddie. Hold on, don't move. I need somebody here in the breezeway with me now. Eddie just fell right onto the concrete. I'll be right there. - Don't move, okay. This could be broken. Just hang on. He fell right off the ladder, hit the concrete hard as hell. He probably has a broken knee. You think you can stand? Yeah, something pushed me. - Here, lift him up. Though his injury was substantial, it could have been much worse. Falling several feet onto the concrete could have resulted in severe injury or even death. Still in shock, Eddie continuously repeated the phrase "something pushed me." We decided it was best to leave the attic alone. There are several police reports documenting claims of knocking and banging on the windows of the home. Even sightings of a ghostly apparition appearing in the window before vanishing. Despite several attempts, law enforcement was never able to locate any evidence nor identify a suspect. One of our stationary cameras in the kitchen caught the following evidence in the living room window. In an attempt to gain more information and perspective, I decided to bring in a psychic medium who came highly recommended by trusted sources within the paranormal field. - I'm Kelly MacLeod, psychic medium, motivational speaker. I'm from Center Line, Michigan. In my line of work, I help with cases, whether it be profiling potential criminals as well as some of the cold cases and trying to put the pieces together, so I was pretty excited to see what is this mystery and what's happening, and to see if I could get something in addition to what's already been reported. So many different energies, so many different emotions. When I first walked in the door, it was almost as if the entire family was wiped out. The person that kind of was responsible for this, it's almost as if they wanted to annihilate the family, and that's exactly what they set out to do, and that's what they did. So, the entity that's actually an assigned, and that's the way I really wanna say it, is that it has been assigned by the original person to be in this house with the family. It doesn't necessarily always have to be active. This entity is always here, it's always watching. It was physical, it really was happening, but if they keep reporting it, the people, they're gonna get tired. The township, the police, the fire department. Everybody's gonna get tired, everybody's gonna deem them crazy. What is the banging? Why do I keep hearing all this banging? We'll follow you. - What is this room here? That was the bedroom of the son of the family, which the activity seemed to center around. - Okay, that's the thing. She used the son as the catalyst. Okay. He's got some issues, and he is the perfect candidate, he's the perfect scapegoat, and that's exactly what she wanted. She needed to pick somebody as a scapegoat. What has happened with the kitchen, with the silverware, with the knife block, what has happened with things beings thrown around, things coming out of the cupboards? Any report of that? Because when I'm standing here suddenly as if knives are coming out, but it's like somebody grabbed a knife and just threw it right across. Not gently pulled it out, they're just whipping it right across. There is something coming up through the floor here. It's almost like underneath. What is directly underneath this room? Crawlspace. - I keep seeing all these hands coming up like they're trapped, like people are coming out of the floor, coming out of the ground. The family that lives here now is not gonna be in danger, because this is not who they're after. If any member of the original family steps foot on this property again, this will open up the energy vortex and it will start everything all over as if it had never stopped. - On the above time and date, this officer arrived at the complainant's address on Dice Road, and upon doing so, made a check of the surrounding area. He found that nobody or any vehicle was in the area. Upon talking to the complainant, he stated that there was banging on the walls so hard it actually broke a hole directly through the plaster from one room straight through to the other. The complainant also stated that he heard voices coming from the walls, saying it was going to kill him and his entire family. I'm going to attempt to try and communicate with whatever may be in this room, in this home. Is anybody here in the room with me tonight? Why did you seem to target Duane? Was there something about Duane specifically? Did you have a vendetta against him? Notice how the environment suddenly changes. The papers on the refrigerator lifted from the force of the air. A mist begins to appear, taking the shape of a human figure, then dropping to the floor, heading toward the hallway. Deputies and state police troopers both say the house now is undergoing a series of strange explosions. Consumer's Power in Michigan, they used equipment to locate the source. Still nothing. - The other recordings were attempted by one of the members of the state police, mini FBI unit, who's a demolition expert. He was asked to go to the house and spend a couple days there, during which time there were sounds or explosions. He attempted to record them. He was unable to do so in an interesting way. He would turn his tape recorder on, and he'd wait, and he'd wait, and he'd wait. Nothing. Then he'd look and he'd say, oh, the tape's running out. He'd turn it off, pull the tape out to get another one. Boom, boom, boom. Then he'd grab the other blank one, he'd put in, start it. Nothing. - Complainant stated the explosions had been going on all afternoon. The last one just prior to this officer's arrival was so strong, he came running back inside and found the family all standing together as though they were frozen. Further, the explosions were heard in different walls. This officer checked the attic and the space under the house. - He's no longer with the department, he left the department after an incident that he claims happened out there where he was physically pushed by a force. Now this deputy was a retired army ranger. Good cop, he was not scared of anything. I met him one day when I was going to court, and he came out of the sheriff's office, and I says are you gettin' your butt chewed again? He said, no no, no no. He says I went out the Pomeranings. He says I told the sheriff I'm not going out again. I'm not going out there again. I says why. He says there are some evil spirits out there. I continued on down the hallway past the sheriff's door. The sheriff was Robert Lupert at that time. I asked him what'd you do, chew him out? He said, oh no, no. He said he was at the Pomeraning's taking a report when the explosions went off and something pushed him in the chest and pushed him backwards, and he said he would not go out there anymore. Now, I explained to him if it happened to me I wouldn't be going out there anymore either. - On November 22nd, 1974, Harold and his family began experiencing an even worse phenomenon, explosions. Witnesses stated it sounded like a sonic boom that seemed to come just from underneath their feet, even lifting them right where they stood. Police responded to the calls about the explosions, and a Saginaw sheriff's deputy was actually injured in the line of duty from said explosions. Now Josh, when people would feel an explosion of that magnitude, wouldn't there have to be some form of residue, something down there to show that this happened? - Oh, most definitely. You would have to have a cracking of a foundation, potentially cracking of floor joist. Being explosions, maybe there's some kind of charring of some wood down there, but if it's none of those things, I'm not sure exactly what it could be. - I'm gonna send part of my team down there. Be safe and to see if you guys can find anything that might suggest that there were in fact explosions down there. - All right, let's get started. - Now, again, this is the first time that this crawlspace has been entered in an investigative matter for over four decades. - On January 21st, 1975, it was on a Friday afternoon. Me and my Dad were out in Hemlock. We stopped at the drug store there, looked down and on the front page it was a picture of our house. - Well, someone released it. They never did figure who it was, but they released the information to the Saginaw news. Saginaw news would come in every morning and read the reports, so we would take those reports and give 'em to the Captain, so they wouldn't see it, but somehow someway they got copies of it. Then Mr. Pomeraning started being bothered by trespassers and by people running, honking their horns and yelling and screaming, which upset him more, and I can't blame him one bit. If he went out there, all he would do is yell and scream at ya. Saginaw County sheriff's department said that the corner of Dice and Chapin was the busiest corner of all Saginaw County that night. - The traffic was just unreal. It was car after car after car, and they had spotlights that they were shining out in the field and at both of our houses. - January 21st, 1975. After six months, police still don't have an answer. Weird sounds and voices, furniture moving, whole house shaking and jumping, cracks in the walls, plaster falling. Police agree there is the sound of pounding in the walls. "I was told to say nothing to anybody "about what I heard or saw," said one deputy. "I spend two night there, I can tell you one thing. "I didn't sleep from the beginning to the end. "One night we had the house surrounded by cars. "When the pounding started, "the cars went roaring to the scene. "Still, we found nothin'." Police contend they do not believe the house is haunted. Bullshit. - In the 52 years I've been on this department, I've never seen anything like that and I hope I never do, because it's sad for the family that lives there to have to live through something like this. - And as far as Harold's breakdown, I had heard later on that he had a breakdown. Whether that caused it, I don't know. - Harold had a heart attack shortly after that, and we were doing mouth to mouth on him at that time at his place, but he didn't make it. - My aunt, like I said, she was a strong woman, and she put up a good fight. She really put up a good fight, but you could see that she was losing the battle. She was one of a kind, she was a saint. After everything she had gone through. - I just know that that's why he, both my parents died at an early age because of this. There was times I would pray to God and say, "Why are You allowing this to happen to us?" And I felt the same way even after my parents both died. You know, they were both quite young. Then I just realized I can't think that way, I gotta be strong, there's a reason for everything. Well, with my brother Duane, this did affect his life. I mean, he's really had no life since, really. He just went downhill and I'm just thankful to God that he's still here. Like a lot of people that know my brother said that they can't believe that he's still alive. - This is the current family that resides here in this home, and you'll notice throughout this home there are so many pictures of them. They're always happy, they're always together, just enjoying life, and it's so ironic to me that those children were born and raised here, and they had such a good life and a happy family, and the Pomeraning family who built this house had just the opposite. They had nothing but misery and fear and panic, and they were destroyed within the walls of this home, and that being said, you have a whole nother family who flourished and thrived within the walls of this home. Why? That is the question. This is much more than, this investigation is much more than a haunting. What happened here in the past wasn't just activity, it was tragedy. You know, that family really was destroyed. Lives destroyed. The radio. Come here. Look at that. That light was not on, that power light was not on... We need to get cameras set up in here. Oh! While distracted by the radio, the two portraits on the wall had been turned upside down. The inverted paintings sent chills down my spine, realizing that no one is able to watch their back at all times. - Let me introduce myself. I am Jerry Solfvin, parapsychologist and psychologist. In the process of doing what we do at the Psychical Research Foundation, we did get a call one day that interested us greatly, and that was from the state police of the state of Michigan. We at the Duke University and specifically the Psychical Research Foundation, had interest and could be helpful to them in solving a case that it had that was problematic. We immediately got more information about it, and they said would you come up here, and we said absolutely. When I arrived I was met by the guy I'd been talking to on the phone, who was a state policeman. Now, he works for a small unit which is a mini FBI. They had been called into the case, they told me, because the local police, the county police, had a time of trying to solve this case, with unusual things happening in this home just outside of Saginaw, Michigan, and neither of those police departments were able, despite putting substantial manpower towards it, were able to find out what was going on, so they got called in, and they spent several weeks on the case, at least one week of which they actually moved into the house. In any case, he gave me a full briefing, a very extensive briefing on all that had been going on and that they had learned after about two years of activities in this house. He drove me to the house on Dice Road, the family met us there. I got to meet Mabel and Harold Pomeraning, and the two sons, Duane and Terry. Mabel looked at me and said, "Oh, I'm surprised. "How come you don't wear your collar?" I said, "What? "Wear my collar? "Why should I wear a collar?" "Aren't you a priest?" Of course, I and to explain to her I'm not a priest or a minister nor an exorcist, however, I do help to get rid of these things, and help to them meant simply and only get rid of this thing. - In the late fall of 1974, Saginaw County sheriff's department began to realize that what was taking place in the Pomeraning home was not actually a criminal matter. It was prowlers or harassments, but actually something otherworldly taking place, something supernatural. Now, many of the deputies from having been out here so many times, began to have a relationship, a friendship with Harold and Mabel. They wanted to to try and help the family still, and even protect them anyway that they could. One of these deputies came to Harold and said that he had a friend that had vast knowledge of the occult. So, late one night, this individual came to the house accompanied by said deputy who we will not name. He unboxed a Ouija board, or, as some refer to it, a witch board. Harold instantly became reluctant as he knew that these type of objects are synonymous with negativity and bad experience. But again, being desperate for an answer, he let the gentleman proceed. The individual began to try to establish contact when suddenly everybody in the room observed a knife come out of the knife block, levitate in the air, and then throw across the room and sticking in a wall, just missing the officer. In front of me, obviously, I do have a Ouija board, and I am about to break the cardinal rule of a paranormal investigator by using one, and of course by using one alone. I am only doing this because I want to recreate something that took place in this home nearly 41 years ago in an attempt to try to reestablish contact and try to solidify the activity in this home and identify, if at all possible, its motive. I'm attempting to establish contact with the spirit, the deity, the poltergeist, that inhabits this home. You can communicate with me by moving this indicator on the board, and pointing out individual letters to spell out a word, or you can also move the indicator to the yes or the no section on the board as well. Are you here with me? Why did you harass and torment Harold Pomeraning and his family? Are you mad that we are in this house? Whatever was communicating through the board had left no room for doubt. We were not welcome in the home. After reviewing the following footage, it became clear that I was not alone in the barn after all. As the activity in the Pomeraning home grew with terrifying intensity, the bewildered family began experiencing spontaneous fires in the home. Each of these fires were investigated thoroughly and to this day, cannot be explained. One of the fires was so baffling, it actually made history. - Duane and his mother Mabel were at home alone. I had left the house. It was one of the times when I had to get more batteries for the various equipment that I had, so I told Mabel and she said, "No problem, go ahead, "because, in fact, I feel very comfortable "and uplifted today." And I said, "Oh, why is that, Mabel?" And she said, "Because we're going to church." Then I went to a photo store in Saginaw, and lo and behold, a fire has happened while I was gone. So I come in, Mabel's now upset. Mabel says, I'm standing here looking at Duane, saying, okay, Duane, are you ready? He says yes, yes, I'm just about ready, I'm just finishing my hair. At that moment, the toilet paper roll, she says, burst to flame while she was watching it. The whole thing, including that little cardboard roll on the inside. Ash, the whole thing, and yet if you delicately handle it, as the fire marshal did, you could actually pick it up. When he put it in his chromatography chamber it was absolutely clean. Nobody soaked this thing in alcohol or any sort of flammable material whatsoever. He wrote up his report and in his report he wrote, for the first time, in the state of history, "There are no way that this could happen." - February 13th, 1975, Michigan department of state police. It should be noted that two members of the Duke University... - Physical Research Foundation here in North Carolina, have been conducting extensive testing at the residence to determine the source of strange noises and strange occurrences taking place there. It is thought by all parties involved that there is some supernatural phenomenon occurring at this location. - And that it also could mean the cause of the fires which have occurred. It is the understanding of the undersigned officer that the burning of the roll of toilet paper is next to humanly impossible when it is rolled up in the normal toilet paper type roll, as it is unable to get sufficient oxygen to produce enough heat to sustain burning. That's a document from the Michigan State police archives, chronicling the bizarre fires with unknown origin that took place here in the residence at Dice Road, in particular in this area of the home, the east end, and the bathroom directly in front of me. We are now going to investigate this portion of the home. Converting to night vision. - That balcony. This is really comin' down out there tonight. The family lost everything in that last and final fire. Family heirlooms, photo albums, valuables, everything. Why did you hate them so much that you destroyed the family and took everything from them? I'm getting a hit here on the K2 meter. - Looks like this room hasn't been used in a while. It's pretty dusty up here. Oh my God. That is so strange. It seems as if the closer I get to the floor. Josh, you guys still in the crawlspace? Yeah, we're still down here. Could you possibly crawl to my location? I'm in the original bathroom toward the east room wall. - Copy that. Do you think you could give me a knocking sound so I know just about where you're at? One more time, please. Yeah, I'm right below ya. I'm getting an incredibly high reading here on my K2, and I tracked it to the floor of all things, and it's just solid red Any wiring or cable underneath here? None at all. Nothing I see anywhere around here. Can you pull out your EMF detector and see if you can pick up this signal? - Copy that. Shouldn't be having a reading like this. A K2 reading that high... Hey. Got a reading here on the EMF detector, displaying on the ground of the crawlspace. All right, there's gotta be something going on here, because I'm displaying that red and you're tracking it to the ground and we're getting a lot of radio interference. Could there be any wires or cables running underneath this house? You think the homeowners would care if I dug in the ground here a bit and tried to find the EMF reading I'm gettin' down here? No, I don't know that they would mind. If anything, we might be doing them a service, because if that's a rogue live wire or something that shouldn't be there, we better let them know about it. Copy that. Man, we've gotta locate the source of this. I just hope that they're using caution because it's definitely not worth getting electrocuted over, but if it's a live wire that shouldn't be there... I think I've found something buried here. It's in the... Is it cabling or wiring? - It doesn't look that way. All right, just try to identify it, but please be careful. I found a jar in the mud down here. Any wires, anything like that? Is it a conduit of some sort? Negative. Most of this reading seems to be coming from this drawer, left or right of it, and it goes up and down, but when I get back over this drawer the reading goes through the roof. So you're telling me that these readings are actually coming from the drawer itself. - That's the way it appears to me. Meet me at the entrance of the crawlspace. I'm gonna head there now. Copy that. - Josh, where are you guys at? - Almost there. Copy that. This is an old glass jar. We got somethin' in here. What is that? I don't know. There's definitely a bunch of water in here. I don't know what that... We can't tell if that's cloth or... It says Harold. Three big black Xs. Sign of the devil. It was evil worshipers. There is something coming up through the floor here. What is directly underneath this room? Crawlspace. And I guess there was some type of argument between her and Harold, but Harold told my father that he always thought that she may have been responsible and did something to the house. Then shortly after, we started having a lot of problems. - When a police officer comes to the end of his shift, retirement, when his tour is over and he retires, it isn't the cases that he solved that he remembers the most, the cases he remembers are the ones that he did not solve. I still remember the Pomeraning case. - Like I say, there are certain things that you'll always remember, and that's one of 'em. I'm sure I'll always remember it. - This is a great case because it really is what we're studying. This is the heartbeat of what we study in parapsychology. - They covered every base they could possibly cover and still no one could find out what the cause of these actions were. - I guess my regret would be that I was unable to help them. I could find nothing. - I believe there was something there. - I believe them 100 percent. - I had no problem at all believin' 'em, because I witnessed part of it. How could you not believe 'em? - I can't explain it. In fact, nobody's explained it yet. - The real progress in explaining the Dice Road case is gonna come when we get a lot more cases and we can put 'em together in that large database that I talked about earlier. That's how science works. - I believe that with all the police reports, everything that was put into this vindicates the family. - I hope they get some peace with it up in heaven where they're at. - I think that they would be happy that you are doing this to try to clear their name. That's exactly what we intend to do. - Well, thank you very much. For anybody out there watching this, and anybody that might doubt that these things happened, what would you say to them? - I would say to a doubter, not to doubt. There are a lot of things that happened in this world that are unexplainable, and I would also say that many of these things we are not to know. I would pray to God and say "Why are You allowing this to happen to us?" Get rid of the thing. There's evil spirits. She was seen several times coming out of the Dice Road cemetery. How could you not believe 'em? She was one of a kind, she was a saint. Harold had a heart attack shortly after that. She made sure that she cut my hair. Two years of activity in this house. Whatever occurred at Dice and Chapel will always be a mystery because nobody knows. There are things in this world we're not meant to know. I hope they get some peace with it, up in heaven, wherever they're at.
