Therefore, There isn't anything to be ashamed of Hello Mika I guess I'm going today. Open your window. Good morning~ This is my favorite place I... Was bullied a lot when I was little I can't tell at all. I was always troubled, Thinking I had to defeat them. The first time I beat them was here. It feels like every time I come here, I become stronger So its true... Hiro is just like a river. Endlessly flowing forwards. Sorry. I'd rather become the sky, compared with the river. That way... No matter where Mika is, I can instantly find her. F somebody dare bully Mika I would fly over and beat them up. {\pos(337,359)}(Dirty woman, you're not good enough for Hiro) Good morning.

Have the baby, you must have the baby! I will definitely bring you happiness. Its okay to have the baby? Of course! Let's work hard together to raise the baby. Isn't it It's not right, I want a more simplistic one. It's so hard to pick a ring Emm.. Ah! This one, This one's good. This one? Yup. It's pretty cute. Alright. Can I touch it? Sure. What are you going to name the baby? We still don't know if its a boy or girl. Since you got pregnant from the library, Why don't you name it 'book'. No way! What are you going to explain that to the baby when he grows up? Is that right. Yes it is. Let's think carefully... Its about time we met each others parents then. Sure. When the baby is born I want to be the second one to hold him/her Moron. The second one is me. How do you plan on raising the child? I.. Am going to quit school and get work. Are you confident that you'll make her happy? This isn't a question of confidence. I'll definitely be able to do it! Then... I have no objections. Mika-Chan. Thank you very much. What's wrong. About Mika's pregnancy... I hope to give the baby.. The baby... I'm going to have the baby. I.. Will quit school and get a job. I beg of you. When I'm 18, Please let me marry Mika. Being a mother isn't an easy thing I will try my best. You must be strong Until I get your understanding, I will not go home Its so sudden, can you understand my feelings I won't give up until you both agree. Hiro! You hair turned white Your hand is so warm If a child is held by this pair of warm hands, it'll definitely be happy When Hiro's hair is dyed black, you have a fatherly look Sleep early And be careful with your body. Alright. I'm be leaving then. Goodnight. Hurry up. Wait.. Mika this christmas eve lets spend it with the four of us Sorry, I'll pass. This is my last christmas eve with Hiro What happened that Hiro had to quit school? It must have been because of you It's none of your business Are you kidding me If it weren't for you Hiro would be mine Saki! I went easy on you Hiro isn't a possession If you truly liked him you wouldn't use such low ways You would fight me fair and square My feelings for Hiro, Would not lose to yours. It's so pretty. Next year we'll be able to see this as a family of 3 It's already 3 people now Look its the babys picture It's so small But its living happily in your stomach If the baby is like Hiro it'll definitely get jealous easily If the baby is like Mika... Hm? It'll definitely cry all the time. What is that.. You should say that it'll be cute. What is this? Open it and see. Even though I don't know if its a girl or a boy. You're thinking a little far ahead. But its so cute. Mika!? It hurts. Mika!? Mika!? Whats wrong? Hiro it hurts so much Mika! Mika! Mika! Mika! Mika. How about my baby? The baby in your belly is gone. Did you fell down before? That can't be true. Hiro? Where is Hiro? When he heard that the baby was in danger, He just ran out. I'll drive the car over Ah, Hiro is here. If anything happens, call home immediately. Why is your hands so cold? This whole time... I've been praying at the temple. The baby is gone. It's not in my belly anymore. Let her lie here.. ..With the flowers you gave me. I heard it was a girl. Sorry, your mother is so useless.. Though we weren't together for long, Thank you for all the great times.

Hiro didn't come to class today. Just ask her out next time, you.. Hiro? He isn't at school? After we became second-Year student, he's hasn't been at school much. I texted him but he doesn't reply. He seems to still be bothered about the baby's incident… Give him some more time. Sorry, Mika sounds so sad It's alright. Then, I'm leaving. You can't keep on hiding like this can you? Hello? It's Aya. Are you going to Hiro's house tomorrow? Eh? Eh, didn't Hiro say his house was empty tomorrow and wanted us to come play? Didn't he tell you? Ah? It suddenly slipped my mind. Hehe.

Even though Yu said it was fate. I felt as if, ..The baby arranged for us to meet. Don't give up on love, Don't say words that make others sad anymore. If mommy is lonely, ..Then I'll feel lonely too. It's as if she's saying that to me. Sigh. What does Mika plan on doing? I'm planning on taking the test for Keidai College So you are dating Yu No it's not. He's just tutoring me. Mika, Iit's about time you started another relationship. How about Nozomu?

Don't worry. Bring this together. Thank you. I'll be back soon. Alright. It's been a while. It's the first time I've seen Hiro wear a hat This is my new style, do you like it? You don't seem to go to school much. Yea. It's too much trouble. I thought you already forgot all about the baby. Hiro.. Why did we end up like this? Good luck on your test. Why are you always, ..So indifferent? Why do you always avoid me? Answer me.. Answer me! Hiro. Please don't go.. That time, If I chose the other path, Would our fate be different? Would I not have had to lose you? [Were you ever happy?] Goodbye, Hiro. [I was once very happy] Bye bye. Mezamashi ga na ru mae ni oki te toki wo tomeru I won't think about it anymore.

Asked me to bring this here for him. Next year...and all the years after that, I'm going to bring it for him He gave me about a hundred of them. I can't even live that long. What do you mean? Tell me, what do you mean by that? He.. Might be dying soon. What did you say? He got cancer. Stop joking around please. He never let me say it. ..Especially to you, Mika. But he's always been waiting for you, Waiting for you while fighting alone. When did it happen? Since the second year. Lets break up. I'm not going to wipe your tears anymore.

That way, I could go without a worry. Mika, I always tried to avoid you. Always made you suffer I'm sorry. Thanks for coming to see me. Promise me you'll be happy It's not possible I can't ever be happy without Hiro. I want you to give me happiness. I have less than three months time left.. I've always... always loved you.

Mika's back again. Mika... Mika's eyes are swollen. Everything he wrote was about me. Mika. Keep smiling. You're one dumb boy, Hiro.. Hiro.. Hiro. You're looking down at me aren't you? I have to happily live on. The happy times I spent with Hiro haven't become a memories. It is because, no matter when I feel you by my side. Hiro, I still love the blue sky Hiro. I still love the blue sky. From this day and always, this love will last.. Forever.
