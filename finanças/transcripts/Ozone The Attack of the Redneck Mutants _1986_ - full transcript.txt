Ozone: The Attack of the Redneck Mutants Stupid son of a bitch! Out of my car! - Relax, sister. - Get out of there now! It wasn't even a fun ride. Look how filthy I got. Kevin, can't you shove that into your tiny brain? I don't want to have anything to do with you or your father. My father has an influence. If you need a job, he can help. I don't want a job with an oil company. I want a job in the industry. Score! I just want you to leave me alone. I read all the letters and articles, you wrote. I knew it would show up at the first sign of a chemical problem. Then you should know that I don't give shelter to enemies. Why don't you call your dad a limo? Just leave me alone! You don't have to be angry! Come back here. You don't have to be angry with me. Look, it was the only way to get you to pay attention to me! Arlene, what are you doing? Wait, I'll give you 50 bucks! For gasoline! Way! I was almost convincing ... Fine. I'll let it come together just this once. I only accept the money because I'm out of money this week. I will not change my principles, Kevin. If you pester me, I'll throw you out! Understood? Come on! Let's go! - What are you doing? - See you, asshole! You can't do this to me! I paid you! Very funny. Put the fucking belt on. Come on! We all agree that the destruction of the ozone layer is a problem. But the industrialized world seems to ignore this problem. ... and this is crazy. A large hole was recently discovered in northern ... Don't forget my chicken, see? - Where did you buy that ridiculous hat, Grandma? - Shut up, you drunk idiot! You haven't known what it's like to be sober for 30 years. You better get in your car while you still can. Deplorable bastard! Ridiculous old lady! By god, this woman must have a flat stomach. It left me out of stock 3 or 4 times. There's no time to replenish my stock. Screw her cakes. I don't care how well she cooks. This woman's appearance would make a dog vomit. Hell. I've seen you puke on Saturday night than this woman would have ever imagined. Shit, why don't I drown in your draft beer? It's a dump. What is that? It's a dead, stupid cow. Come here, big boy. Come on. Come on. Come here, big boy. Are you thirsty? Come on. Oh, you silly! Watch out! Come here. How are you, dude? Come on... Good dog. Dear? Bob! Bob! Bob! Where the hell was that dog ?! Without that! Come on, you look great. - I'm running out of sofa. - Come on, kitty. Dad won't be back for an hour. You know I can't do any of this before the show, It makes me waste energy. What? He's going to sing for some drunks in a bar. You call that singing? We will have a lot of time to have fun after the show. I wrote a song, dedicated to the one I love. - Who is he? - Is this you. - And I'll sing it for you now! - Okay, kitten. It's a good one, this time. I want to listen well and tell me what you think, okay? Are you ready? I know what you have, I know what you have. You can teach me how to make coffee, and I will make it hot. Wade, listen up, okay? I will show you how much I love you, and you will feel good. Now, listen to this, you will love it! Give me love right in the middle, give me love right in the evening. What do you think?! Wade! Wade! Love, that was great, now save it. Wade, the phone is ringing. Let me get on the phone. The phone is ringing. Mrs. McCoy! Hello. No, I'm fine, I was rehearsing. No, I didn't see Wade today. I will tell you to call if I see you. Bye. Mom is going to kick my ass, I was going to work today. You can find some work at any time. Kitty, I have to go. Wait a second! Don't forget to pick me up at 5 am, Wade! - Okay, kitten. - Is important! Come on time, don't forget, Wade! Wade! Disadvantages ! Baby, do you want more tea? Isn't it hot outside today? How are your watermelons? You know, I've never, ever, seen so much heat that season. Love? Love what happened? I'm talking to you, could you answer me? It's all right? Answer me when I talk to you! Are you all right, Kevin? Are you okay? It seems not. There comes another hole, Kevin. Leave me alone! Can you just leave me alone, for a second? If you really read my articles, you wouldn't walk like that in the sun. The skin is yours ... Idiot. Come on, little babies. Little sweetie goldfish. Good boy. Little sweet goldfish. Shit! Come on. Come on, stupid animal. Come on. I'll stick it in your throat. Arlene! Arlene, come here! Arlene, you have to see it! I think it's a new species or something. Arlene, come here! - What are you waiting for? - I should have left him back there. Damn, are you deaf? Arlene, I discovered a new species here! Come on! Arlene, my god! You took my leg! Arlene! Help me! Raise. - God ... - Quick! Arlene, help me! Help me! Arlene! Oh, merda! Get me out of here! You took my foot. - Drop it, dammit! - I'm trying! This is great, awesome! Listen, you'll be fine. I'll have to take anti-rabies and everything! I hate syringes. I can't stand them! I hate syringes! It didn't even touch! The skin wasn't even scratched. - Goes into. - Thank God. Come in! Stupid! Stupid chicken! Come here. Come here. You silly chicken! I'll get you! - Why did we stop here? - I have to make a phone call. Phone call? It can wait. I want to go home now! Look, your tapir. I have to know more about the ozone layer. Do you understand, comrade ?! I think we are dealing with a major environmental disaster. Hello? Hello, anyone at home? Hello? I would like to use the phone. Hello? Central, this is an emergency. I want you to call me with the environmental protection agency . Washington city. Thank you. Hello, my name is Arlene Wells I need to speak to the director. No, I cannot return. It's an emergency! Say that there was a total depletion of the ozone layer ... I am a student specializing in environmental science. Listen, you have to transfer me now! Shit! Oh my God! What is wrong with you? Someone was murdered inside. - It's horrible. - What?! - Someone was injured. - What? Kevin, shut up, let me start the car. Let's get out of here! - Damn, he doesn't care. - Oh my God! Jesus! - What is that? - Start the car! My God I do not believe! Ask for help over the radio. Damn it! Can anyone hear me? I pay as much as you want, just help me! For God! There's a monster on the roof of the car! It's starting to give way! It's a monster! It's a monster! Come on! We need help! Help! Help! Go away! Go away! I don't even know where we are! Calm down, idiot! Nobody will believe that! Please help! Give me that thing! It's an emergency. I repeat, an emergency. We're being attacked by a homicidal maniac who wants to get in the car. We need your help. Hey, kitten, what you need is a real man, not that one in the car. Why don't you meet me, big boy? But right now! Can you handle me, big boy ?! Kitty, go crazy when you see what I can handle. Just give me an address, and I'll show you what you're missing. A large farm on the street with 106. Come and get me ... Remember to load the gun ... Douchebag! Ui! Boy, boy! It's going away! Ah, he's coming back! Oh no! No, no, no! God... What are you doing out there? Shut up! Just shut up! Are you trying to get in ... Go the other way, move! Get out of here! Give me something. Great, Kevin, what a help. Very good idea. What the fuck ...? What a zone, melons fucked the whole car. Shit. Let's go! God! We will! Go away! Go away! Arlene, got me! It seems! Come on, put the butt here in the truck! Look, he's still alive. Don't piss me, boy. I'll fix it. Wait, I forgot my luggage! Oh no. Listen, we're all going to die if we don't get out of here! What a pity! We'd be screwed already if it was for you, kid! Don't look at me, he's completely right. What do we do? That's terrible... Shut up! Tell me what the hell is going on, little shower. I know it sounds crazy, but there's a hole in the ozone layer. It's making everything mutate. We would have died there, if you hadn't come. It's not quite what I expected but I think it will do. Listen, don't put the horse in the rain. I had to think of something to get your attention. - You understand, don't you? - Yes I understand. It's almost lunchtime, looking hungry, amazed boy. Listen, what happened to that person can happen to all of us. We need to get out of here, now. Okay, little shower. We need to get mommy, she will hit me if she stays here. Then it will be just us. Okay, we'll have plenty of time for that later. - Okay, love? - Now I enjoyed listening! Look at another one! My god, I can't take it anymore! Kevin, let me go. Drop! Boy, I'm going to rip your skull out if you don't shut up. Okay, okay! Kitty, take care of the steering wheel. Listen, wait. Better make sure your mother is herself. If you understand what I say ... Babe, my mother never got sick any day in her life. If I were to become a mutant, I would have already. Hey, mommy, come out here! Did you see? It's no mutant! Why the hell are you screaming? Mama, get out, come and meet these people from the city. This sweetie here is Arlene. The other is Kevin. We have a problem, we need to get out of here. You're not going anywhere if you haven't eaten yet. What the hell happened to you, anyway? Dona, we don't have time to eat, we have to get out of here! Listen here, you soft ass. You don't yell at Mom like that! If she says to eat, we will eat. - Understood? - Okay, okay! - Son, I want to know what's going on here. - Mom, I'll tell you now. Take these weapons, go in the yard and practice targeting the melons. Be careful not to shoot your foot, soft ass! Wade, please hurry up. We have to leave before dark. You bet. - Come on! I want to talk to you now! - Oh, Mom! Okay, son, now you tell me. What strange shit is going on in this city? I don't know, Mom. People are becoming mutants and coming back to kill everyone. Mutants, what the hell is a mutant ?! Ugly-faced animals that walk, vomit and everything, we already killed some today. They better not try to vomit on my property, I kill them all, sink their heads in the ground. I bust their ass, you know I'm capable, son. Now come help me, we'll take this food out let's have a picnic in the shade of trees. Not bad, huh? Do better, Kevin. Nice shit. Come here, sit down and eat something. - Sit here, little man. - Come on, sit down, have lunch. Eat some of this tasty potato salad. Can we just eat and go? Just eat, boy. Shut up and eat. Good food, Mom. Nothing as good as some cookies. Come on, girl, eat more cookies, you eat like a bird. Thank you. Here, we have to eat some chicken. If I had known they would come, I would have prepared more. Sorry, kitten. Son, let the poor girl eat in peace, she needs it. Okay, mom. Son, I'm sure you look familiar. Have I seen you around here before? No, I'm just a city boy. No, I know I've seen you somewhere, Your face is really familiar to me. Mom never forgets a face, she has a photographic memory. So ... You weren't here about 6 months ago ?! It seems to be that date that I remember you. I'm sorry, you're wrong. Now I remembered! You were here, asking about that girl, who was asking about a chemical factory. What? You son of a bitch! You're involved in this, aren't you? It's a lie, the old woman doesn't know what the hell she's talking about! I'll fix it already! Son of a bitch! I'll teach that smelly ass a lesson ! Come on son, tow him! You bastard! You fucking bullshit! Here, son of a bitch! Here, shit bag! - Give it to him, son! - I'll crush your balls! Come on, son! Break it! You're hanging me ... Get out! Damn, it's turning into a mutant. We have to do something. My son, my son! Do you have a rope? We need to tie him up, with something. There's rope in front of the barn. Arlene! Arlene! Kevin, shut up and take the other side of the rope. My boy, my poor boy. My poor boy. I'm sorry, but we have to get out of here. We can do nothing more for him. Nobody is going anywhere! C'mon C'mon! You called me a bitch, right? I will show you. Come on, move on. Wade... Wade! This was the biggest mistake you ever made! Come on, come on. Come on, move! Okay, boy, better talk now! I want answers from you now! I know you are responsible. What happened, son? You will tell me now, speak, say! Mrs. McCoy, if you stay calm ... Shut up, girl, I have nothing against you, this is the one I want to talk to. He is responsible for everything. Come on, I want you to speak! Tell me who is behind it all! - Go ahead, talk! - Better answer it! Your rich dad is not here to protect you! So your father is in the oil business, right? What else did you lie about? Douchebag! Come on, boy, talk! You knew about the chemical factory from the beginning, didn't you? You sold it to that scum, didn't you? You're not screwing yourself for the ozone layer! There's little fucking for the environment! Just call yourself, right ?! I hope she blows your balls off! Either start talking now, or I'll blow your brains out! One, two ... Three ... Yes, yes, you bastards! Are you going to stick my head in a lamp? Skin me alive ?! You are crazy! Fine! I knew about the factory! But I didn't know this was going to happen, my dad didn't say it could happen! Why don't you let me go? Let me go! You liar! Damn liar! Does your father's garbage own that factory? Do you know what you did? If we lose the ozone layer, we will all be mutants! You you! I'll kill you! You... My son. My son. Calm down, Mom will take care of you! I'll fix you up. You deserve everything that's going on! Arlene! Arlene! Wait! I'll go with you! Wait! Please! I'm so sorry! General store Well, let's go back now. Let's give a good applause to the neighbors and residents of the city! Look! Now, you will see talent! With you, Loretta! Damn it! Come here, Loretta Lescan! For God! Isn't she something? Pure sympathy. Damn it! For God! Hi friends, I'm going to sing my favorite song, "Sixteen Tons". Let's give this coconut candy a hand ! We will! Some say that the man was made of mud. A poor man is made of blood and muscles. Muscles and blood, bones and skin ... Beautiful, Loretta! The best I've ever seen! My God! What's wrong with you? Another older day, dying in debt. Saint Peter, don't call me because I can't go, I owe my soul ... To the company store! My love! I can see... Oh, sorry, I invaded the stage. Shit, I forgot the lyrics! Shut up, asses! Give the owner a chance! I can see ... See. Shit, I don't remember! Let me come in your mouth! Okay, guys! We're here at the store festival! And we have for you hillbilly, a real talent! OK. Where's the one with the hair? You're not getting sick, are you? I mean, you're not going to become one of those monsters ... Listen, idiot, just take us to the city, we have to warn you! - Understood? - Yes, you're right! Here we go! Look! There she is! Sorry for the delay, I have a song for someone I love. It's not you, Wade! Let go, Loretta! Damn it! Let's listen! You can do what I do, but you won't have what I have, I can teach you how to make coffee but you can't get hot. I can show you how to love me, show you what is good. Love is to the left, respect is to the right! Are you serious? Try to make sense, for God's sake! Are you serious? Pay me with your card the best motel in town! I hear your soul, your heart locked. He thinks he's romantic, but he doesn't know how to deal. Do you think you can ... Give me what I deserve! Inferno! Damn! Oh no! Arlene, I swear I didn't know this was going to happen. I will do everything I can to fix this. Fine? Arlene? No! Oh God! Captions by Karagarga Community
