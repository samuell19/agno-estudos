[dramatic music] [Victor] Do I ever come in here with my Consumer Report under my arm? No. - You're three months in arrears. - I understand that. No, all I'm asking for - Plus the current month. I already gave you time. - is two weeks! [dramatic music] Hey, Victor, what's up? Arthur, Arthur, listen, how long have we been friends? [Arthur] Oh, Brother. Since high school. [Arthur] Yeah, well. That's almost 20 years. [Arthur] 20 years. Since the heart attack, David, he has lost his edge. [David] Yeah, I think he's frightened. Okay, well the price of his timidity is gonna be very expensive. O'Neill is prepared to pay 100 million dollars for this merger, David. That is three times what this company is worth! [David] I know, I know. Victor, this firm is my grandfather's life. You told me you're gonna foreclose on my house and I'm not supposed to take that as a threat? Well, where I come from that is a threat! [Arthur] So, Victor, what's up, buddy? I'm just having a little cash flow problem. I was just wondering if I could borrow a few bucks to tide me over until we get this deal done. [Arthur] A few bucks, well, I... Two weeks at the most. That is three times what this company is worth. You know it and I know it. And then at the last minute Raymond backs out, that's insane! [David] Keep it down. [Arthur] So how much we talking about? 100,000, two would be fantastic. [Arthur] I can't, I can't, sorry buddy. If there's anything else, I mean, we're friends. No. [Arthur] Another time, no problem. No, it's okay. You can't just take away a man's car. [Man] I'm sorry Mr. Sandeman, next Thursday we repossess. [Man] Victor, you ready to hit one outta the park? This deal is a lock. [Man] So, I can keep sending my laundry out. [laughing] Can I call you Larry? [Larry] Yeah, please. This is a hell of a deal Larry. For your company and for ours. I can't be seen as a loser, it's the kiss of death in this business, you know that, Arthur. [Arthur] Yeah, yeah. Yes it is, I'm sorry buddy. [Victor] No, no, it's okay. [Arthur] Hey, you understand, another time no problem. Of course I understand, of course I do. Of course you have Mr. Brunel's support. Raymond Brunel is 100% behind this merger. [Man] Good, it's a hell of a deal. I just need some time to handle some internal issues. Make sure we have all our ducks in a row. [Roger] What? Yes Roger, you heard me, just get it out there you'll be bringing back a truckload. I'm just trying to survive. [dial tone] [dramatic music] [phone ringing] Hello. [Jeff] Hi, sweetheart. Hi. [Jeff] It's almost eight o'clock. Is it that late? Oh my God, I must've lost track of time. I still have a couple things left to do here, my new boss is... [Jeff] Is a workaholic, maybe? Very funny, takes one to know one. I'm going for a run, Dorothy, I gotta lose 10 pounds. Well, I'm impressed. Goodnight. Goodnight Mr. Sandeman. Well, goodnight Mr. Brunel, don't stay too late. Better to paper shuffle 'til nine than to fight your way through all that traffic. [Dorothy laughing] I'm looking forward to that traffic, sir. Clean out that fridge of yours, Dorothy, 'cause I'm gonna bring you back a truckload. [Dorothy] Very good, sir, goodnight. Goodnight. [Jeff] I saw it. You got in? [Jeff] Yeah. Well, what's it like? [Jeff] It's beautiful, it's perfect for us. Really, it's a loft? [Jeff] Yeah, we need to see it right away. Oh, okay. Okay, well pick me up tomorrow, we'll grab a quick bite and then run over. [Man] I'll set it up. All right, I love you. [Jeff] I love you too. Bye. Victor. Victor. I know you believe that the merger is the right thing for us, I don't agree. I've reviewed O'Neill's proposal from every angle, it's a no go. And that's my final decision. I just don't think that it's the right time, either for the company or for me. I understand. [suspenseful music] And I respect your decision Raymond. Enjoy the fishing. Thank you, I will. [suspenseful music] [camera whirring] Ah. [suspenseful music] [alarm beeping] [tires squealing] [dramatic music] [whistling] [dramatic music] [whistling] [suspenseful music] [alarm beeping] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [groaning] [dramatic music] [rock music] [dramatic music] [rock music] [siren blaring] [Christine] Jesus! [crashing] [Man] Learn how to drive lady! [horn honking] [suspenseful music] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. That guy is an idiot! Look, I think the best thing to do is just copy down each other's information. Yeah, I left my wallet at home, okay? Don't you have your insurance information in the car? I got a lot more damage than you do, I'd be willing to let this whole thing go. Well, I wouldn't you ran into me. Well, you slammed on your brakes for no reason. I slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting that kid! [Victor] You pulled out without looking. Should we just call them over and fill out an accident report? No, I'm sorry, we don't need to do that. Let me check my glove compartment, just wait here, okay? Shoot. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [camera clicking] What are you doing? [Christine] It's for the insurance claim. You know we don't need to do that, we can handle this ourselves here. [dramatic music] [Christine] Brunel Global Securities, which one are you? Raymond Brunel. We're neighbors, 210 Granville, 200 Granville, we share a garage. Yeah. [Christine] What happened? Trunk popped open, I guess, when we tapped. Weird Card? Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah, you know what? I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lost my temper it's just, been one of those days. It's okay, I handle it the same way as you, just not at night. Yeah, how's that? Running, 6:00 a.m. every morning rain or shine. Good for you. So I'll hear from you, Mr. Brunel. Got your card. [suspenseful music] You drive safe. [dramatic music] [grunting] [dramatic music] [siren blaring] We'll maybe get something off the engine block. It's burnt, but you can probably get something off the plate. Do you mind? Sorry. Doctor, care to speculate? Driving your car into a rack of propane tanks is often fatal. Throw us a bone. Male, Caucasian, 60, maybe 70s, badly burned. Any kinda I.D.? Hey Johnson! Need to get him on the slab. Have Mcreedy call me when the body's delivered. [rock music] [dramatic music] [rock music] [DJ] And if your commute's on Baldwin Pass you're in for some serious delays, it's closed between Grace and Earl due to a fatal car crash reported as having taken place last night. The driver is as yet unidentified, police and fire are on the scene. Weather and traffic every 10 minutes on Seattle's only station for all news all the time. And now, from the business desk, the dollar's made. [rock music] [suspenseful music] Hi, my name is Victor Sandeman, I rented a white van from you on Tuesday. Right. I'm gonna need it for another day. Five minutes. Do you know where my eyelash curler is? There's some stubble on my left eye I haven't curled yet. Under the sink in your make-up bag by the cotton balls. What's it doing where it's supposed to be? How am I gonna find anything if it's right where I left it? I function best in chaos. Maggie, I need to take a shower in the next 20 minutes. Chrissy, I'm having a little trouble deciding which of your shirts to borrow without your consent. Ooh, that does smell good. Thank God you worked your way through school. All right, which one? I'm in a Western paisley, I'm milking a cow, and I'm desired by every man who sees me? Or... Breakfast is served. Thank you, or, I'm argyle golf chic, I'm supporting a nine iron and I'm desired by every woman who sees me? Which one of them captures your unbridled sexual abandon? Maybe I should borrow your blue cashmere? You can have my blue cashmere, I'm not taking it with me. [speaking in foreign language] Dear knight? New beginnings, wanna travel light. God, I'm gonna miss you. I can't believe your wedding is only four weeks away. You can't believe it, it's my wedding, there's still so much left to do. Oh, by the way, I think we found a new place. Hallelujah, that was such bad luck losing that house last week. I know, but this one's a loft in the same building as Jeff's workshop. Mm, sweet. And, if we like it and they accept our application we can move in this weekend. And, closer to work. Oh yeah, how you getting on with your new boss, the dragon lady? That was said in a moment of weakness. She's tough, but she's good. I think I'll learn a lot from her. Good morning, Chris, what's on the calendar? Good morning, Ms. Ferris. Judge Woodruff called, he says it's urgent. He always says that. And Mr. Ridgeway would like to see you this afternoon regarding Hartman. Here's a corrected draft, and these are the relevant sites. All right, regarding Hartman, I want the transcripts from both days of the plaintiff's deposition along with relevant exhibits. I thought you might need those, they're printing out right now. Oh, good. Well, it's his cellphone usage that's gonna hang Hartman so go through has phone bill from June '01 to April '02. And I need it on my desk before lunch. I've prepared everything up 'til March '02 I'll pdf them and also print out hard copies, and April '02 will be ready by 11. Chris. Yes? [Mary] May I ask you a question? Sure. Well, it's my experience that Harry Ridgeway reads people very well. Now, he pitched you hard after I requested backup on Hartman. He said that we'd make a good match, that we share the same ethics, same standards. I didn't ask any questions, but I took it with a grain of salt and I assumed he was biased. Well, I was wrong and he was right. So how is it that someone with your abilities is a paralegal and not somebody that I might face as opposing council? I got sidetracked. I'm reentering law school in the fall, your alma mater, U of W. Excuse me, Ms. Ferris, Judge Woodruff's clerk's on the phone. He needs to talk to you, he says it's urgent. All right, put His Honor through. We can't have the Honorable Ben Woodruff with his panties in a twist. Hey Chris, why don't you get suited up and come with me to the pretrial? You can take care of the exhibits. I'd love to, thanks. Judge Woodruff, good morning, sir. [suspenseful music] You know any good lawyers? I got us grilled cheese. [both laughing] We have 25 minutes. We'll eat fast. If this merger came to you as CEO, would you turn it down? Of course not. Course not. You know what? I think you understand the business better than your old man. Look, I am very concerned about this. Which you should be, 'cause one day this company's gonna be yours, and then what's it gonna be worth? Let me tell you something David, the market's change. Right now they're in our favor. She asked me to accompany her to the pretrial. Ooh, that's great, babe. I hate to break it to you though, these are anything but good grilled cheese sandwiches. Excuse me, gentlemen. He's like he's embedded in concrete. I mean, they're grilled, yeah, they're cheese. - It's old school. It is. Let me tell you something, David. Mr. Brunel - Where's the love, I ask? is basically just gonna sit around and wait for some other man to just do the drop. And I've got 45 minutes. Make another chart, and we can talk to him later, hold on. [cell phone ringing] Hello. Yeah, put him through. Robert Powell, I've been trying to get him all morning. Up to his usual tricks. - So we can move in right away? Yeah, if they love us, yeah. How could they not love us? We're getting married in four weeks and two days and we don't have a roof over our heads. We cannot let this opportunity with O'Neill slip through our fingers, okay? I wanna talk to him as soon as I get back in the office. Okay. [upbeat music] Hey, right on, two bars! I have two bars here. [camera clicking] [Christine] Got you. Now, we have to record this very important event. I agree completely. [Jeff] One bar, reception's terrible. [Christine] Ooh. Hold on, there's three bars here. I got the refrigerator. Probably the only place this thing is gonna work, so. [Christine] Nice. Hi Mr. Marcus, yeah, we're already here. No, no, I can hear you. This is a great space. Okay, I understand. Then I'll get an answer as soon as I know it, okay? I love it. So the answer is that we love it. And, I will get an application to you this afternoon, okay? Great, no, we're very excited, okay. Thank you, all right, bye. Okay, babe, photo op, photo op. Like they said to the boys at Iwo Jima, "You mind hoisting that flag again?" I love it. One more. [upbeat music] I love it. Oh, that's beautiful. I love it. Vehicle was registered to Brunel Global Securities on Granville. Have a look at this tire tread, the left rear there. That Lincoln wasn't going any more than 20, 25 miles an hour. He blacked out, maybe? Like a heart attack? Maybe. Feels it coming on, tries to slow down. It really hits him, and his arm seizes up, he loses control of the wheel. Kaboom. Maybe. Or maybe somebody just gave him a push. CSI delivery. Contents of the wallet. Thank you. We got a license. What about a name? Brunel, Raymond F. Brunel. [rock music] [dramatic music] [rock music] [dramatic music] [screaming] Watch out! [screaming] You okay? Oh, that man was crazy! He was! [somber music] [doorbell buzzing] [Maggie] Yeah, hello? Maggie, it's Jeff. Okay, I'm buzzing you in. The patient is resting peacefully and is expected to make a full recovery. Babe! Ow! I was jogging the bike path, just about to head over to West Emerson, and this van came out of nowhere. Thank God you're all right. Yes, it's what you get for being into health. No one ever got run over from sleeping in. My endorphins must be released. It's what makes me the happy, unstressed bride-to-be. Yeah, you don't want to see her when her endorphins haven't been released. It is pretty scary. You know what was weird, Jeff? The van never slowed down or stopped. It was like he didn't see me, or didn't care. Well, I'm just glad that you didn't get run over. It was the look on that woman's face that saved me. It reminded me of New York. I'm all right. No, I'll just leave a message. Raymond Brunel. No, no, Brunel, B-R-U-N-E-L. That's right. No, I'll just call back, thank you. Stupid. Calls? Yeah, your roommate phoned. She's gonna grab a ride with Caroline. You're expected at 8:00 at Domenico's. Very trendy. My girlfriends are taking me out to celebrate. A bachelorette party? I love those. And also, a Mr. Raymond Brunel called. That's the guy who ran into me, what'd he say? "He has to take off early for the weekend." "He'll check in with you on Monday "and get everything all squared away, "but you should feel free to get any repairs you need done." "Don't worry about the estimates." "He trusts you and thanks you for being so understanding." Did he leave a number? I didn't take the message, Erika did. I wish he'd run into me. [phone ringing] Maybe that's Mr. Right right now. Ms. Sternwald's line. Yeah, hold on one second. Wrong Mr. Right, it's the groom. Hi. But listen, we may not have a dime to our name, but we now have a roof over our heads. We got it! We did. Application accepted. I just gave him a check for first and last. We have a home. [Dorothy] If you'll just follow me, Mr. Brunel's office is just down this hall and to the left, second door on the right. [Malone] Thank you. [Dorothy] You're welcome. [suspenseful music] Dorothy, who are they? Police detectives, I have no idea what they want. Thanks Dorothy, I'll find out. So, how can I help you? You're related to Raymond Brunel? [David] He's my grandfather. Mr. Brunel was driving a 2005 champagne-colored Lincoln, plate number 1-8-0 I-N-W? I don't know about that, but that is the make, and it is a champagne Lincoln. [knocking on door] [suspenseful music] Oh, I'm sorry, David. I didn't mean to interrupt. No, Victor, come in. Victor Sandeman, senior partner. Detective Bill Malone, Seattle P.D. [Ed] Detective Ed Reigert. Nice to meet you. Do you want me to? Sit. Please continue, Detective. This has something to do with my grandfather. Sir, your grandfather's car was found just off Baldwin Drive this morning. It had crashed into a propane refilling station. The driver was killed in the crash. We've made a provisional I.D. of Raymond Brunel as the driver. Oh, my God, I don't believe this. He was just driving to the cabin. [Malone] Did your grandfather have any medical conditions? Was he on any medications that you know of? He'd had a severe heart attack last fall. He was on a daily medication. [Malone] Well, we'll need a family member to come down to the coroner's and I.D. the body. Mrs. Brunel's in Europe. Yeah, the police have agreed not to release Raymond's name until all family members have been notified. But, David's having a hell of a time reaching her. I know. It is a terrible tragedy. But, truthfully, Mr. Brunel hasn't been well since the heart attack. Yeah, the company was really being run by David and I. And we wanted you to know that despite Raymond's passing we are still 100% committed to this merger. Yeah. It's what Raymond would've wanted. [dramatic music] Okay, ladies, I have an announcement. Whoever brought this gift needs to be reprimanded. I like the milkmaid. - This is not okay with me. Let's get to the good stuff. The lovely Christine Sternwald, the soon-to-be Mrs. Jeffrey Davis Monroe, can no longer be considered a vagrant. Yes. [Maggie] A roof over their heads! Yes! - A toast. Cheers. - I got two cups. [dramatic music] [Christine] It's totally cool, yeah. So, that will change, of course, tomorrow, when the check bounces. [Maggie] All right, and now for the presents. [Woman] Oh, what's next? Garcon? Let's top her up. Why do I think I'm gonna need this? The champagne, I mean, not the gift. Thank you, handsome. Okay. Whoa. [laughing] [Woman] That's nice. [glass shattering] [Maggie] That's so you have a sexy piece. Oh my God. - What is it? [whistle blowing] You blow the whistle, he'll think it's halftime, and hit the mute button. Oh! [Woman] It is a fact that more children are conceived during halftime than at any other time. [Woman] Oh my God. Let's drink. - Oh hell. "Let's party, girls." Yay! "There was once a lady named Chris "who was given her very last kiss." "To old lovers she's deaf 'cause she's crazy for Jeff "and they've signed up for marital bliss." Awe! I live with a poet and I didn't even know it. [Maggie] Thank you, I'm very talented. This just in. That's so you'll have something to wear in your second year of marriage. If she's drunk and doesn't pretend anymore. Awe. [Woman] It's all downhill. [Maggie] They'll have a great sex life. I'm drunk on life. Careful, Maggie, that taillight is still out. Oh, thanks, Jeff. Bye, Caroline. Bye. - Here's your key. Thank you. You're the best friend a girl could have. You two have a great weekend together. Mm-hmm, bye. Bye, honey, have fun, I love you. Love you. [Maggie] Call me on Monday. Okay, where to, Captain? [Jeff] You like surprises, don't you? I'm marrying you, right? [Jeff laughing] Then you are gonna love this surprise. [dramatic music] [Christine] That was a long five minutes. Your surprised took longer than expected. Come on. - It's cold out there. You gotta get your heater fixed in the truck. I will, I promise. I wanna show you something. Is this gonna be crazy? [Jeff] Mm-hmm. [soft music] Oh, Jeff. This is beautiful. Can you handle another glass of champagne? Yeah. Hello, home. [timer dinging] What's that? Just a little something to go with the champagne. It's hot. Wow, so this is it. Yes, this is it. The undisputed, unchallenged world's greatest grilled cheese sandwich. May I? Of course, yeah, it's just getting cold. Here, Worcestershire. Mm, somethin' somethin'. Here's the love. This is the greatest grilled cheese of all time. ♪ Today is ♪ ♪ Today is today ♪ ♪ I can't try to live forever ♪ ♪ Ba da da ♪ ♪ I know I'm invincible ♪ ♪ I think ♪ [soft music] [Jeff] What is it? I wanna tell you something that I never talk about. [Jeff] Okay. About New York. Is that okay? Sure. Okay. I was stupid on two counts. The first count, you don't go running alone in Central Park at 10:00 at night. There were four of them. I don't remember anything about the attack. They told me in the hospital that's your defense system looking out for your sanity. I was lucky. A good Samaritan came by before they raped me or killed me. Never did find out who that was. I'd still like to thank him. I was unconscious for six weeks. The second thing I was stupid about was not getting any help. Instead, I isolated and just fell apart. Life was on hold. [crying] But thank God for Maggie, for her kicking my butt and dragging me out here. It was good starting over. New memories. [sniffing] New streets. And then I met you. I'm like someone who survived a fatal disease. Everything tastes sweeter. Thank you. [dramatic music] Oh, man. [suspenseful music] [gasping] [grunting] [Maggie crying] [Victor] no! [Maggie] Let me go! No. [screaming] [breathing hard] [heart beating] [whimpering] No, no, no, no. No, no, no. [crying] [dramatic music] [soft music] [screw gun popping] Morning. Good morning. Did I wake you? Nope. I'll be finished here in just a minute. How long have you been waiting there? Just got here. I never get the chance to see you work. I like it. What's this? That is something that I picked up at a garage sale last year. "This is the forest primeval." "The murmuring pines and the hemlocks "stand like druids of old." "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Evangeline, 1847." "V. Lindfors, 1946." I'm gonna find a place for this where it gets the attention it deserves. I would like that. I love coming here. Every time, it's like I'm entering another world. Do you know how glad I am that opposites attract? Me too. I thought I was supposed to marry someone like my father, over-worked, over-stressed type "A" personality. So instead of marrying him, you became him. Someone had to be the son he never had. But this world of yours is very seductive. You're my druid. Careful, careful. This thing really packs a punch. I shouldn't have put it there. You smell so good, like wood, I love that smell. Well that's lucky for me. You know, some people are allergic to it. Not me. Everything else, yes, but not wood. What's this? Well, that's a piece of Sitka spruce. It's about 80-years-old, I would imagine. You know, some of these trees can grow to be about 300 feet tall. I really like working with this stuff. Could you make a frame for that picture out of this wood? Yeah, I could do that. I wanna show you something. [dramatic music] Wow. That's amazing. [Jeff] Do you like it? Mm-hmm. It's not a commission. Come here, sit, I want you to try it and see how it feels. This fits my tired old bones just right. It does, doesn't it? And it should. I took a lot of careful personal measurements. Our first heirloom. Mm-hmm. And I was thinking that maybe the second one off the assembly line. The bed. Mm-hmm. Which will also require many personal measurements. Maybe we should get started on those right now. Maybe we should. Thank you for my lovely chair. You're welcome. And those exacting measurements. How about I call you in the morning and we'll organize all the movers, huh? Okay. Goodnight. [somber music] [light switch clicking] Mags? [dramatic music] Maggie? Mags? Maggie. Oh my God. [crying] Oh my God! Was Ms. Wexler seeing anyone, Ms. Sternwald? Old boyfriend or lover who might have carried a grudge? No, she dated, but no one steady. Ex-husband? No. Well, is there anyone you can think of, anyone at all, who might have reason to harm her? No. But... Yes? Nothing. What do you think happened, Detective? Well, it looks like she walked in and surprised a burglar. Just bad luck. Oh, we're gonna need a list of what's missing, and do you have a contact for next of kin? I would like to make that call. I think it's better if her mother hears it from me. [Christine crying] [somber music] I was just thinking about Maggie's mom and how sad she was on the phone. I miss her so much. I just keep thinking if somehow I had been there I could have done something. This is not your fault. I don't know, I feel like it is. So she stayed with me last night, and we didn't even get back from the station until after 2:00. Well, obviously, she needs some time for herself. Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that. And have her call me when she feels up to it. I will. And again, thank you. [dramatic music] [high heels clicking on floor] Sweetheart, where are you going? To work. I just spoke with your boss, everything's fine. There's no need to worry, and you can take off as much time as you want. If I stay here, I will just fall apart. But you didn't even sleep 10 minutes last night. It's better if I go to work. No, no... It is, really. It's all right, I've already seen it. [phone ringing] Ms. Sternwald's office. Yes, may I ask who's calling? Hold, please. [phone ringing] Yeah? It's Mr. Brunel. Good afternoon. Ms. Sternwald? [suspenseful music] Raymond Brunel. Listen, have you had a chance to get your car fixed yet? [Christine] No, I'm afraid I haven't. I have a deadline here at work. Okay, but let me run something past you. I just got off the phone with my mechanic, who, by the way, does great work. Now, he'd be willing to fix your car and then bill me directly. That way, I can avoid the insurance hassle. Does that work for you? I guess so, yeah. Well, here's the problem. He's going on vacation. [Christine] When? The day after tomorrow. But he assured me that if you could get your car in there today he could have it ready for you by end of day tomorrow. Mr. Brunel, I'm really busy. Is there any way... I've already arranged for you to get a loaner from him. I mean, I really want to make this as convenient for you as possible. [Christine] Okay. Oh. Sorry. Could I put you on hold for a minute? Absolutely. [Christine] Yes, Ms. Ferris, how can I help you? I need the annotated cell phone bills for Hartman. I've got Judge Woodruff on the line for 4:30. Yes, I've got them right here. Oh, great. Listen, I'm very sorry to hear about your friend. Thank you. I've highlighted the suspicious ones in yellow. Sorry, Mr. Brunel, where were we? The shop is A-1 Body and Fender, 187 West Franklin. Yeah, it's up over the hill, off Templeton Road. Ask for Jimmy. Jimmy, okay, I'll be there between six and 6:30. Thanks. Excellent. [knocking on door] [dramatic music] David, I am so sorry for your loss. I can't believe it. I can't believe that Raymond's not gonna come bustling through that door, all full of ideas, and energy, and creativity. I just, I can't believe it. I am so sorry. I reached Grandmother. She's flying back, she'll be here this afternoon. I'll pick her up. She was stoic. It's like she expected it. I guess she's been preparing herself for this, at least since the heart attack. I think she's the only one of us who faced the reality after he was sick, an amazing woman. Yes, she is. And, you'll publish the obituary tomorrow? Yeah. Good. Oh, why didn't I prepare myself for this? I feel... I feel sucker-punched. I buried my head in the sand, and I couldn't imagine a world without him in it. Me too. I had a question about the Steadman account this morning, and I found myself heading to his office. Pavlovian. [David] Yeah. He was a powerful man. [David] He sure was. Must run in the family. [dramatic music] I was heading to his office this morning, and then I checked myself, and found myself heading to your office, David. You're the CEO of a great company now, and I believe you're the right man at the right time for this job. You really think so? Oh, I know so. That means a lot, thank you. My God, Victor, these are big shoes to fill. These are big shoes. Then tighten your shoelaces, David. This is your time. Victor, what happened to your head? You ever leave the kitchen cupboard door open? Oh, man, that hurts like hell, huh? Just stupid. [laughing] Just stupid. So, shall we talk business? Brunel business? Okay, business. O'Neill, I checked the grapevine. This deal can be salvaged, but it is gonna take a decisive move on our part. We're gonna have to extend our hand. I need a little more time to think about this. Think about what? Look, when my grandfather was making the decisions it was easy, I could just sit on the sidelines. Things are different now. Different how? I keep thinking about what he would want me to do, how he would feel about me breaking up this company. This was his whole life for 50 years. Well, I think it's the right move, but that is a decision that's on your shoulders now. [dramatic music] Victor, wait, just... You really believe this merger is the right move? Yes, I do. All right. Let's make this happen, huh? Good. You call O'Neill. Get him on the phone, give him the good news yourself. And David, those shoes fit you perfectly. Craig, I am so late. Could you do me a favor? Call Brunel, get the number for A-1 Fender on West Franklin. Tell the mechanic I'm on my way. Okay, will do. And have a good night. All right. [Christine] Thanks. [Operator] Directory assistance. Yes, can I have the number for Brunel Global Securities, please? [dramatic music] Oh, good, I wanted to talk to you about the Sandeman account... - Yeah, Dorothy, I'm late. Okay. Walk and talk. Absolutely. [cell phone ringing] Hello? I called Mr. Brunel. He must have been gone for the day, so I left a voice mail. And I couldn't find a listing for A-1 on Franklin or anywhere else, sorry. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay, I'm just in the middle of nowhere. It's cold, it's dark, and I want hot soup. I'll find it, go home. I'll see you first thing in the morning. All right, goodnight. [dramatic music] Hello? Hello? Oh, my God. Hey! What are you doing, lady? You shouldn't be around here, no way. I'm supposed to get my car fixed. Nobody there, you crazy? The place is shut up tight, you shouldn't be around here. Go home! Crazy damn woman. People don't know what the hell they're doing anymore. Sure, I'll just have a look. Ooh, hold on, hold on. Chris? Chris? There's a Mr. Brunel on the phone. He's responding to a message you left last night. Great, put him through, I'll take it right here. Okay. Hello, Mr. Brunel? I'll just transfer you, one moment. Mr. Brunel, hi. I got to your mechanic a little late last night, but to be honest with you, it looked like the place had been closed for quite some time. [David] I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about Ms. Sternwald. [Christine] Is this Raymond Brunel? No, this is David Brunel, his grandson. What can I do for you? Is Raymond Brunel there? What exactly is this about? Raymond Brunel rear-ended me last week. We've been trying to make arrangements to meet to get my car fixed. Right up here is fine. [Christine] When I spoke with him yesterday... Yesterday? Yes, yesterday. He said that he didn't want to go through... Let me be clear. You're telling me you spoke to him yesterday? [Victor] Larry, David's here, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. [Larry] Yeah, sure. [David] My grandfather died in a car accident last week. [Christine] I'm sorry, I don't understand. No, there's nothing to understand. I'm just gonna assume that this was an honest mistake, and we need to end this conversation. Goodbye, Ms. Sternwald. I'm so sorry I'm late. This woman calls and says that my grandfather rear-ended her last week, she talked to him yesterday. Really? Thank you. Larry O'Neill, meet David Brunel. David, pleasure. Good to meet you. My condolences. Thank you. Glad this day has finally, finally come. Yeah, myself as well. Shall we sit? Yeah, let's. Yeah, I got us a booth right over here. Great. - Great. [suspenseful music] [Man] I spoke to Thompson yesterday. [Larry] Thank you. Everything okay? Oh, yeah, it's good. [phone ringing] Craig, I need your help. [Officer] Hey, Malone, look at this coloring. Wow, maybe a week old? No, more. Officer, get Reigert to call Jetwan. We're gonna need some additional lab work. "Raymond Franklin Brunel." "Age 75, died in a car accident on December 7, 2005." "He is survived by his wife, Margaret, "and his grandson, David Brunel." Okay, The Raymond Brunel I met was no 75 years old. Or next time he calls, we need to get his plastic surgeon's number. Maybe. Let's see what this Mr. Brunel looks like. Blood splatter. Whose blood? The trunk was right here. Yeah. We need another look at that car. [dramatic music] It's not the same man. [Malone] Thanks for seeing us today, Mr. Brunel. I apologize for any inconvenience, but we think it's important. [David] I appreciate you keeping us up to date. Mr. Brunel, as a result of the coroner's findings we are treating your grandfather's death as a homicide. What? The multiple contusions on the left side of his skull appear to be blows struck with maximum force by an assailant. Oh, my God. Homicide? Raymond Brunel didn't have an enemy in the world. I'm gonna have to ask both of you where you were the night of the incident? We've checked the parking garage security tapes, so we know you left at 6:15. Yeah, I was having dinner with some friends from about 7:30 till 11:00. Okay, we'll need names and contact information, Mr. Brunel. [David] Of course. Mr. Sandeman? I left about 8:30. "8:35, 35 minutes before Mr. Brunel." And you went? Straight home. We're gonna need to access company employees and records. [David] I'll get you whatever you need. Detective Malone, when can we make arrangements for the funeral? My grandmother's anxious to take care of it. [Malone] As soon as we get a release from the coroner, we'll let you know. So who is this guy? Well, that's the $64,000 question. The guy who busted my tail light on December 7th was driving a champagne-colored Lincoln. He says he's Raymond Brunel. He shows me proof of insurance with Raymond Brunel's name on it, and I'd say he looked a healthy 35, maybe 40. That same guy, he sounded the same to me, anyway, calls me this Monday, the 12th, and says, "Hello, I'm Raymond Brunel." And somehow he convinces you that you need to get your car fixed in an area that's perfect if you want to buy methamphetamines. The plot thickens. Today I speak to someone who says he's Raymond Brunel's grandson, David. According to David, Brunel the elder was killed in a car accident on December 7th. So who's the guy I spoke to this Monday, the 12th? I check the computer. Up pops a picture of Raymond Brunel, 75 if he's a day. Not the 35-year-old who rear-ended me. You make a mean martini, any refills? [chuckling] I gotta warn you, life seems focused when you're seated, but when you stand up, it changes dramatically. And I don't mean dramatic in a good way. Listen, Jeff, I think this whole thing is connected. I have a fender bender with a guy who says he's someone he's not. Then I almost get run over by a white van. Then poor Maggie. Then the same guy sends me to get my car fixed in a neighborhood where they never find the body, and there's a white van parked there. Did you talk to Detective Douglas today? What does she think of your theories? Detective Douglas thinks I'm nuts. Apparently, so do you. I didn't say that. Right, you didn't verbalize it, but that's what you think. No, that is not what I think. What I think is that you're playing armchair detective with this whole thing... I'm not playing armchair... Chris, maybe Brunel's chauffeur was driving the car, or maybe it was Brunel's grandson, and I gotta tell you, there's got to be at least 10,000 white vans in the greater Seattle area. Well, I'm only talking about one. And what about Maggie? You heard what the police said, that this was a robbery, end of story, case closed... No, not "End of story." Maggie was murdered, and I think... Oh, forget it. [Jeff] What? Tell me. I think the burglary was faked. Oh, Chris, come on! We are getting really close to the definition of paranoid here. I think you have a lotta stress on your plate right now, with Maggie's death, your new workload, trying to find a home. That is not what I'm talking about! Can you listen just for a second to me? You and I are getting married in four weeks time, and that's huge. It would be absolutely normal for you to have last-minute jitters. Don't patronize me. This is not just a feeling in my gut, an instinct. I think I'm in danger. Yes, it's circumstantial, but that doesn't mean it's not valid, and all you can do is dismiss it? Shrug it off as if I'm some sort of hysterical neurotic? You should trust my intelligence, Jeff. [Jeff] Chris, where are you going? [Christine] I can't stay here. [Jeff] Chris. Taxi! Taxi! Hey! [suspenseful music] [cell phone keypad beeping] Hello? Hi, I need a taxi. Can you hear me? Hello? You're breaking up. Damn it! Damn it. [cell phone keypad beeping] Hello, hi, I'm at Drake and First. No, I can't hear you. Come on. - Chris, what are you doing? [Christine] Failing at calling a cab. [Jeff] Please, get in the car. [Christine] No! Come on, Chris. Let's go home. [Christine] No, I'm fine, I'm taking a cab. [Jeff] Chris, please, get in the truck. [Christine] Let go of me! You're acting like a crazy person, Chris. Oh, crazy and paranoid, that's quite a laundry list. I didn't say you were crazy, I said you're acting crazy. No, what's going on here is that you think what happened to me three years ago in Central Park is distorting my ability to see reality. Right? Yeah, I do. Taxi! Go to hell. Hey! - You know what? I didn't deserve that. [Christine] Matter of opinion. [David] And if you wanna talk to me I will be back at our loft. [Christine] Enjoy yourself. [thunder clapping] [Larry] Made the adjustments you requested, it's printing out now. [Victor] Excellent, Mr. O'Neill. [Larry] We should be there no later than 11:00. Yeah, I'll see you at the office in an hour. [Larry] And smoking Cohibas by lunch. [chuckling] I'm looking forward to it. [Larry] Yeah, me too. Great. [suspenseful music] [Christine] I'd like a word with Mr. Brunel, please. [Dorothy] Certainly. Is he expecting you? No, he's not. It will only take five minutes. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. My name is Christine Sternwald. Well, Ms. Sternwald, usually, we have an appointment. Mr. Sandeman, thank goodness you're here. We have a little problem in reception. A young woman, she doesn't have an appointment, but she insists on seeing Mr. Brunel. I spoke with her, but she is adamant about seeing him. I don't know what to do. Did she say what she wanted to talk to him about? No, but she will only speak with Mr. Brunel, and she refuses to leave until she does. Her name is Christine Sternwald. Is David even in yet? No, he is due in shortly, though. [Warren] What do you suggest we do, sir? Warren, get your security guys and have her escorted out of here, and when she's gone, I wanna be updated. Yes, sir. I wasn't sure what to do, sir. You did the right thing, Dorothy, keep me updated. [Dorothy] Absolutely, sir, thank you. Let me know when David arrives. [Dorothy] Yes, of course, sir. [Christine] This is a private matter. I only need 15 minutes of his time. It is urgent I speak with him. Miss, I might as well stop you right there. Without an appointment, there's absolutely nothing we can do. If you don't leave voluntarily we'll have you arrested and charged with trespassing. I will be more than happy to let Mr. Brunel know that you would like to see him. Now, these gentlemen will escort you out. [Christine] If Mr. Brunel decides he can't see me, fine. I will leave. But please let him know that I'm here. We spoke on the phone yesterday. It's in my phone, let me show you. It's Mr. Brunel's number. [Dorothy] Please, now, these gentlemen will show you out. [Christine] You're forcing me out. Please, thank you. I just wish I could express to you how... We have been through this and without an appointment and without you telling me what this is in regards to... Ma'am. - Mr. Brunel! I just need a moment of your time, sir. - Ma'am, come along. [Dorothy] I am very sorry, Mr. Brunel. Ms. Sternwald, come along. Get off of me. - We have it under control. Ma'am, please. Ms. Sternwald? It's about your grandfather and the night he died. Thank you, Mr. White, five minutes. Is she gone? No, Mr. Brunel is meeting with her in his office. What? And, he'd like to know if you'd like to sit in. No, no, I'll pass, thanks. Okay. [David] Just so you're aware, we will be taping this. [Christine] Okay. You have five minutes. Photos of the damage to my car. Photos of the damage to your grandfather's car. The driver showed me an insurance card and identified himself as Raymond Brunel. He didn't have his license, he said he left it at home. If it's substantiated that my grandfather was involved and at fault then we'll be more than happy to pay for whatever damages your car sustained. [Christine] Is this your grandfather? Yes. Well, that's not the man who rear-ended me. I've never seen that man before. She's after money. My guess is with a check in her hand, she'll just disappear. See, I don't think so, Victor. She kept insisting that my grandfather was not the man driving the car. Well, she can insist all she wants. It doesn't make it true. Did she have a photograph of this man? No. Warren taped the meeting. [Dorothy] Do you want me to call him? Yes, I wanna hear that tape. And have him run a background check on her. So, I guess I should call Detective Malone, tell him about this woman, this is nuts. David, listen to me. O'Neill and his lawyers will be here in 15 minutes. Don't worry about this girl, I will take care of it. - Warren I need you to do a background check. You need to focus on this deal. [Dorothy] Christine. Okay, 8:35, Sandeman's Jag. Fast-forward it for me, will you? There. 9:08, Corolla, with a woman driver, right before Brunel's Lincoln, 9:12. So run the plates. Let me read that back to you. "I'm sorry about last night." "Please give me a chance to explain, we need to talk." "Let's meet at the loft at six, I love you, Jeff." Do you wanna leave a number? No, no problem. Okay, sir, I'll see that she gets it, bye-bye. [dramatic music] So, what do you want to do tonight? I can't eat any food. You know I'll start bingeing again. I know, I already lost like 15, hold on, hold on, Ms. Sternwald's here. Ms. Sternwald? You got a message. Ooh, yeah, yeah, I wanna go see that movie. Malone, "Christine Angela Sternwald, "2649 Hesby Street, apartment 24." You here to join this investigation, Eleanor, or are you just here to strong-arm me into buying your daughter's Girl Scout cookies again? Nobody twisted your arm to buy that second box. So, what brings you to our little corral? Well, if you still smoked, you might have cracked this case. While we were enjoying our nicotine addiction in the parking lot, we had a little shop talk. Seems Ms. Sternwald has had a busy week. She was involved in a homicide this last weekend. She discovered the robbery-murder of her roommate. You won't find her there, she moved in with her boyfriend. You're welcome. Don't stop smoking. [Driver] I'll give you a hand with those. Thanks. What you celebrating? Oh, this is make-up food. You know, like kiss and make up after a fight? When we fight, my wife does the shopping, but it's for jewelry and a lawyer. [chuckling] Whew, where's your elevator? Thanks so much for trucking this all the way up here. Sitting in a cab, you get out of shape. You can just set that box on the counter. [Driver] Sure. You want some water? Yeah, please. Okay. Oh, I got to get back to the gym. Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Okay. Let's see, what do I owe you? 10 bucks. Oh, and those last two bags, you can just put them on the inside of the door and close the door on your way out. Great, thanks a lot, have a good night. Bye. [driver whistling] [floor boards creaking] Jeff? [dramatic music] Sweetie? [dramatic music] [gasping] Don't move, don't move, don't move. Don't say a word, shut up. Leaving the bags down by the bottom of the door here, ma'am. Good luck with the food thing, it worked for me. [dramatic music] Shut up, don't you say a word. [groaning] Hel... [screaming] [gun clicking] [dramatic music] [Christine breathing hard] Look away. Okay. Don't judge me. You cannot judge me. This is all your fault. This is your responsibility, not mine. [Christine] Please don't do this... Shut up, shut up, don't talk and do not look at me! [crying] I'm not a killer. I'm not some psychopath. [scoffing] See, you don't understand, I don't have a choice. You kept showing up, and showing up, and showing up. I didn't wanna hurt anyone, but you kept showing up. I was just trying to survive. It's not gonna help you... Don't talk! It is not gonna help you to kill me. It's not gonna get you out of your mess. Please. Shut up! Okay, okay, okay, okay! - Just shut up! You are gonna shut up, no more talking! Please. Oh, please don't. Shut up! [Christine] Do not put on the duct tape Shut up. [Christine muttering] I can't hear you when you talk to me! Do you understand that? I will not hear you! I just need to fix this, I just need time to think. I need time to think! God! [phone ringing] Ms. Sternwald's line. Hi, is Chris available? It's Jeff Monroe calling. No, Jeff, she left. She got your message, and she'll meet you at the loft. I didn't leave a message. [Craig] The message you left this afternoon to meet you at six. Well, if she calls back, would you get her to call me, please? Thanks. [Victor] God! [cell phone ringing] [Operator] The cellular customer you have dialed is away from their phone or out of. Oh, God, so stupid. God, so stupid, stupid! God, why did you have to be in that parking garage? Everything was coming together. It was perfect, every detail, and then you had to drive by. [groaning] I slaved away for 15 years, and for what? You know, I made bold decisions only to have people screw me. I watched the market collapse, and I lost everything. But I was back in the game with this merger. Oh, I positioned myself perfectly, $100 million deal. Every detail. Do you have a towel? I was not gonna let some senile old man and his clown-faced grandson stand in the way of what was right, of what was mine, and then you, you couldn't just walk away, could you? No. No, you couldn't just let it go. Little Miss Nosy and her crappy little car. "Where's my insurance?" Let me tell you something, sweetheart, I have worked too long and too hard to let a nobody like you stand in the way of what is right. Of what is mine! [doorbell buzzing] [dramatic music] Don't you say a word. [doorbell buzzing] [cellphone beeping] Come on. Okay. [cellphone keypad beeping] [dramatic music] What? What? What? What? What? What? No! Help! Help! Help! Shut up, shut up! Seattle P.D.! Come on out with your arms raised. [Christine] No! [dramatic music] Watch out! [clanking] [cell phone ringing] [cell phone ringing] [dramatic music] Dammit! [grunting] [yelling] [whimpering] Oh, oh God. [groaning] [moaning] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [cracking] Ow! Ow! Ow! [engine roaring] [tires squealing] [grunting] No! [Victor yelling] [Christine screaming] [tires squealing] No! [breathing hard] [dramatic music] [soft music]
