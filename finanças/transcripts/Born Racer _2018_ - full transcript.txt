Ladies and gentlemen, on your feet. The whole list of drivers for the Indianapolis 500-mile race. We don't turn up to just do a job. We turn up to win and, you know, win as many races as we can. And you know, win as many championships, 500's, whatever it is. You know, that's what it's all about, you know, is just winning. That's why I do it. We just don't talk about the dangers, really. It's, like, we just don't. I'd like to sometimes, but I don't want to put that into his head either. I've married a guy that, unless he's going really fast, he doesn't feel alive. He feels euphoric when he's chancing death. 232.595 on the lap speed for Scott Dixon. Yeah! Yeah, baby. This is an incredible start for Scott Dixon. One and a half to go for Chip Ganassi, watching his driver, Scott Dixon. Such a disciplined driver. Another in the 232's. And the roar of the crowd. That was perfection. Checkered flag for Scott Dixon. And a new number to the top of the board. 232.164 miles an hour for four laps around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Scott Dixon records the fastest speed in over 20 years. Congratulations. The good news is you didn't have to wait long. Mate. Sweet. Chip Ganassi comes up, gives him congratulations. They have got the pole here for the 101st running of the Indy 500. I got to ask, how does it feel? It feels, uh... You did it, bro. Nice job, buddy. Nice job. Dixon's garage. The garage is now open. The garage is now open. Ready to roll. Ready to roll. Start pressuring them. Check the pressures on me babies. 5:15. What will we know in 12 hours? Performance come off the tires... Hours before the race, I've already switched off from the family life and just totally focused and thinking about only racing. When I start to get nervous or anxious about the race, I typically get quite quiet. Uh, I don't talk to too many people. And it's... it's just, you know, thinking about a lot of things. I've been with this team for 16 years. So they're like family. Like, I've known these people for a long time, maybe longer than some of my best friends. You know, you need a lot of confidence in motor racing, especially in the people that you're working with that, you know, the cars are safe, they're gonna be mechanically sound. And, in a lot of ways, you are putting your life in their hands. We're good to fire up here, TK? Radio check, Scott. 10-4. Loud and clear. If you're a driver, it is not all about you. You may be the focus, but the great thing is, I think Scott's aware... that it's not just about him. And without all those people backing him up, not gonna happen. He is the glue of the team. The team revolves around Scott. When you're driving a racing car, it's all about balance. You know, everybody talks about balance. And that's the front rear end sliding a bit more than the other. And Scott will set the car up so the rear is sliding. He loves the rear of the car sliding. He-He loves that, sort of, right on the edge feeling with-with the car. It gives the team such a lift to watch him do that. You know you've got a guy there that can do the exceptional. All right, everybody here? Okay. Good Morning. Between now and, uh, the checkered flag, I'd like everybody to focus on one thing, and one thing only... Winning this race. Put everything else outside of your mind, everything we have to do to win this race today. Yeah. Thanks. Can I help you with that? Yeah. It's always something simple, Kate. We're still figuring it out. What did you do, Kate? I'm here to help you, Kate. What did you do? We got it all the way on the back. Race has been part of my life since birth. It's always been in my family. When you start to make it more than a passion, more than a hobby, when you start making it a career or a lifestyle permanently... you pursue perfection. It's a bizarre phenomenon that... that human beings want to compete constantly and prove that they're the best or just master whatever is in their path. It's easy to say you pursue winning, but winning doesn't happen all the time. It's few and far between. It's extremely difficult and takes a mass of dedication, sacrifice and timing. Drop it down a little. Oh, there it is. Yeah. See? Seven. I feel the same way I do about him as I did about Mario and Ayrton. You always do your job a hundred percent for the driver you're working for. But with Scotty, I feel that little bit of extra motivation, because he's got that little bit extra going for him. And so you want to give everything and then some, you know? And it was the same feeling I had with Mario and with Ayrton, you know? You knew you were dealing with a special guy. I think globally the Indy 500 is a significant event. Winning it multiple times defines who you are. I think it changes the driver's career. That one day will change that driver for ever. Every time you get into that car, you don't know if you're gonna come out. You don't know if you're gonna come out alive. You don't know if you're gonna come out in one piece. You don't know that, but you don't think about it. You think about the job that you want to do. You want to be the best, you want to do your best. You have to face death. Two of my closest friends that, you know, had the most beautiful men that were plucked, um, out of the sport, and sometimes I do go into the race, I am, like, you know, "Oh, I don't want it to be my turn." Hey, good luck today. Oh, they're racing now. Into the first corner, the 35 car, the Mount Wellington driver, there he goes, Scott Dixon takes the lead. Second place... Every night before a race, before I go to sleep, I text him, say, "Have a good race. Be safe." He's still my little boy and... it does, it worries me, but I am more relaxed. I think, because... he's so confident about his driving, I don't worry as-as much. I-I can relax. What's the long-term aim? Starting off in Formula B? Um, go to Ford, then get graded for my license, hopefully again, and go to Atlantic, and hopefully Indy cars or something. I'm normally pretty quiet at this time and just taking in a lot of information. That's kind of the most comfortable part is, you know, once you get in the car, you're belted in and you just start to get into the zone. You kind of have that eerie silence before the engines start. We try very hard to live in the moment, because I am scared that one day, you know, it's my turn. And that's what I have to live with as well. We're green! In these speeds, you know, 400 feet per second... almost a football field every second... the cars are inches apart, so literally, way faster than you can react. You're adjusting your steering, making corrections faster than you can think. You're not thinking about turning the wheel, and if you have to think about, then it's too late. Uh, up top right there. Stop! Stop! Ooh! I heard the spotter scream something at Scott, and then... it went silent. Is he all right? You look up at the telemetry screen, if you're not already, and you see a lot of things on the telemetry that are not normal. Uh, up top right there. Stop! Stop! Ooh! The car goes in the air, the RPM goes up, the steering goes crazy. But the speed is not doing what it should. All those squiggles, they speak to us as engineers. We know, ooh, the steering shouldn't look like that. It's almost like you're outside of yourself looking down, because everything is happening faster than you want it to. But it seems slow, 'cause it all just slows down in your mind. At those speeds... you know that... it's not gonna end well. But those-those moments, agonizingly long. What a huge crash. Agonizingly long. Scott Dixon is in it. Jay Howard is the other car involved. Dixon and Jay Howard. There is Dixon. Look at that car. It is destroyed. There's nothing left of the back. That sawed the engine in half. Well, I think it affects the entire team. Because this is a people business. We are people. We love each other. We support each other. We eat, sleep, and travel together. You lose family members in this deal. Huh? I honestly thought that was my turn. Yeah? After Susie. Hi, everybody. Saw he was gonna hit the wall, but I thought it'd be a little bit later. That's why I chose left. Um, tried to slow the car down as much as possible, but just wasn't to be. And Scott Dixon already thinking about next year. Yeah. Yeah.Yep. Yep. Glad to see you walking out of there. Wrong place, wrong time. Is that... Were you just hanging on for the ride at the point? Yeah, it's just... Yeah, that car saved our life today. Didn't it? He had a good car as well, like... I'm just thank our lucky stars. But I'm kind of like... Now I'm like, "Oh man." But... Yeah. At least he's good. Daddy's here. Yeah. Hi, monkey. How are you? Good? Good. What are you guys doing? We've always been a pretty open family in the fact that I do something that's dangerous. So, Mr. Scotty, I know that there's something wrong with that. You should go get a boot. Ah, we'll see. I've never reflected on, you know, maybe I should give this up. I love, you know, the people I get to work with, and my passion is racing. When he was a real baby, if he wanted to say good night to me, he had to come downstairs, because we were working on the race car for the next Saturday night race meeting. He'd want to touch every tool that was there, and if it had grease and dirt on it, that was him... He loved it. The first time I ever got in a go-kart was... was crazy. In a go-cart, you sit really low, you know, so everything seems like it's going very fast. There's the sense of speed and having control of something. I'm sure I was going very slow at the time. We used to go away a lot together. If it wasn't at Mount Wellington, it was at the Auckland track, or Hamilton, Tokoroa or, uh, Hastings. We would go with other families and sleep in tents. And the, uh... the families that had plenty of money, they'd be in the motel. Well, we'd make sure we got invited to the barbecue that night at their place, or if you wanted to shower, somebody would always offer. It's a huge, huge family. It's a competitive family. Even from go-kart days, if you had a big crash or a flip or a wreck, you know, that same day was probably the best time to get back into the car, just so, you know, sometimes it can be, um, you know, tough for people. But it's-it's... that's the best thing you can do is get back on it, but... I can't get ready on time. I just physically cannot get ready on time, can I? You look amazing, babe. Thank you. So do you. I can't believe you managed to get that foot in that shoe. Bit swollen. See, so I would have milked it and, like, dragged my leg. Pretend. Okay. I think we're ready. You had a feeling, huh? I had a feeling about him, didn't I? Should have told me that in the morning. I did tell you. I should have spun out and crashed when the car was loose earlier on. I don't know how you didn't, man. That was wild. Did you see it go... You were so trim. I had huge runs on you, like, still couldn't make it past. The toughest part is just trying to get ready so quickly. And I guess in this situation, it'd be nice if there's a week off. And Detroit is probably... It's the roughest, and it's the only doubleheader of the season. ♪ If you a star I be your Milky Way ♪ ♪ If you a bar I drink up every day ♪ ♪ If you the town I be the talk ♪ ♪ If you the talk Baby, I'll be the walk ♪ ♪ If you wanna dig I be your gold, baby ♪ ♪ If you wanna live I be your old age ♪ ♪ You be the time I be the clock ♪ ♪ You be the tick I be the tock ♪ ♪ If you wanna race I run like crazy ♪ ♪ If you wanna ride I drive you daily ♪ ♪ If you a beach I be the sand ♪ ♪ You wanna give I be your hand ♪ ♪ You got me stuck to you You got me stuck to you ♪ ♪ You got me stuck to you You got me stuck to you ♪ ♪ You got me stuck to you You got me stuck to you ♪ ♪ You got me stuck to you You got me stuck to you ♪ The jump from Indy to Detroit is notoriously difficult. You're going from the most important race of the year, and three or four days later you're on the track in Detroit. But when you have something massive happen at the 500, like we had... completely destroyed a car at the 500... The debris was spread across our three garages. There was... I mean, there was just unrecognizable parts of the car everywhere... And it compounds the stress and the anxiety and the issues you're thinking about. And they're all 365. How much? When you're in the building and you're doing your prep work, it's a routine. You know what to do. It's the same thing for every race, pretty much. And then whenever a crash happens, you still know what to do. You know what parts to change, what needs to be checked, you know how to fix the car, how to do this, how to do that. You just have to do it at an accelerated rate. Just get the temperature, Tim, please. Oh shoot. I got to go pour this out. Come on, Dave. After the crash, we built a new car from scratch. So we had a couple of late nights at the shop. And, uh, everything seemed to go back together well. I think Scott's doing fine. I'm sure he's a little bit sore, but I think we'll be doing all right. I mean, right now we're second in the points. So, you know, this is important. So we're just trying to keep the pace up. If I know that I can be physically fitter than the competition, you know, it's one less thing I have to worry about. Five seconds. This day and age, it becomes a lot more than just running or cycling or swimming or going and lifting weights. You know, it's become more about reaction times to, you know, plyometrics to... Five seconds. Any kind of advantage that you can find for what you do in a car, you know, helps... fly, reverse fly. These cars have, you know, over 6,000 pounds of downforce. You're getting five to six G's in some of the corners. Your neck is one of the hardest things to train, with the G loading up the helmet, you know, it's always pulling on you. Push, pull. Push, pull. Push, pull. Last 15. And then the cardio side of it where you're well over 150, 160 beats per minute for that three-and-a-half-hour race. Come on. Come on. Five to go. Correct. We obviously can't put them in the race car. We don't have that capacity in here. But you can still train the neural pathways to process things easier and faster, and identify things, and, um... so we train the mind and the brain to do these kind of things, and then when it comes to the race car, they'd hopefully just shift gears over to the race car... same neural pathways. Eight seconds. He'll be in there carrying on a conversation and speaking nice and soft and just doing it very methodically, but he's not wasting energy. Whereas other drivers are just pounding away and moving their feet and everything. He's very efficient in there. I think that's probably the way he drives. Good. Everything correct. Good job. 126. Just do another on that heat. We'll load the wheel up super heavy sometimes. Sometimes a little lighter. It's the same motion as they use in the race car. You're training the exact same muscles. And you're doing it with the reaction, so it makes them, um, able to respond quicker in the car. When the accident happened, from where Scott realized that he had to decide right then whether he was gonna try to go to the left or the right, and you have basically process what a cruise missile does. I need to get from here to there and avoid this in milliseconds. Even with the best human reactions, it still takes a couple of tenths of a second to actually start pushing the pedal to slow the car down. And sometimes you have to decide which way you're going before you really know what's happening, before you really know what the trajectory of that car in front of you is, whether it's gonna go left or right or flip over or what. You watch it on TV, and it's always in slow motion, it seems like, "Why didn't he do this? Why didn't he do that?" He did it before you even realized the accident was happening. It just happens so fast. Stop! Stop! Ooh! Okay... welcome to Detroit. Um... just a follow-up on last week, um... we obviously didn't win the Indy 500, and that's what we open up every meeting with. So what's our choice left now? Win the championship. Win the championship, right? Okay. Obviously, the 10 car, we had a little brake issue. And obviously with, uh, Evel Knievel down there, uh... As if the week didn't have enough activity already, you had to give us more that day. Anyway, we're poised for the rest of the season. So let's go get it. With me, what accidents linger longer and set doubt into your mind are ones that you've caused as far as losing control of the car, spinning out by yourself. That's when I felt most vulnerable on a confidence level, and confidence in my ability, to where it starts to affect how fast you go. But with Indianapolis and the crash, it was just wrong place, wrong time. I couldn't have done anything different. Jay couldn't have done anything different. Nobody did it on purpose. So we'll see what happens today. Uh, so it could be three stops today, Dave? Eighteen seconds. Eighteen seconds in your time. So just remember what today is all about. Today is about today. Racing validates what we do today. So... do what you do best. With Indianapolis and the crash, it didn't reflect in my mind at all something that would hinder my performance down the road. It was just about... how do I get my body back to something I can use, you know, racing with a broken ankle. You could tell he wasn't too phased after the accident. But to be honest, it was a big question mark for all of us, I think. Race fans, it's time for those most famous words in motorsports. - All right, fans, are you ready?- Drivers, start your engines! The crash really brings the risks to light. If, as a driver, you're a fraction of a percent cautious, then you're not as quick, and your further back in the field, well, then it just snowballs from there. Rahal in front of Dixon. And talking about Scott Dixon, what an incredible comeback this week. On crutches most of the week. An injury to the inside of his left ankle, in the tibia, a large weight-bearing bone in the lower leg. He said, "I can push the brake pedal." It's pulling my foot off the brake pedal that's a problem, with the swelling and numbness." But Dixon hanging on. Rahal now 8.6 seconds in front of Dixon. It's amazing how Scotty didn't want people talking about his injury. He admitted that this is gonna be a very difficult day. He said, "My biggest concern is gonna be fatigue." The car itself isn't a fun thing to drive. It's an extremely sensitive car. You could roll over a pebble, and you can feel that in the chassis. And it vibrates like mad, just vibrating, and you can't really breathe. And you can't see what's in the mirrors because they're vibrating so bad. Scott running second. He's got about five seconds on Hinchcliffe in third. You're holding your breath in the corners to fight the G forces. He's got to put 300 pounds of pressure with one foot on the brake pedal. But you're right. He has not complained. He has not said a single word. What blows my mind is Scott has still got to put up with all of the physical feeling of the car around Detroit or Toronto, any of the street courses... Graham Rahal has a 6.6 second lead over Scott Dixon. And put in lap times that are within hundredths of a second of each other again and again and again and again... perfect. Perfect. The entries are perfect, the exits are perfect, the mid-corner speed is perfect. Those skills combined just blow my mind. Career win number five to Graham Rahal at Detroit. Great drive for Scott Dixon in second. Some days the reality exceeds expectation, and some days you accept the reality. Well, if you can't win today, be second. If you can't be second, be third. And with that attitude, you never give up. You never stop trying. That was hard work. Good job, bro. Hey, just missed it. Well done, Scott. Hey, thanks, man. Sorry, I got a little angry there, but... That's all right. We get through it. Not the end of the world. Thanks, man. I think for me that's been a huge help is Poppy and Tilly. Ready to jump? No. Why not? Watch this. Mommy says I can't swim in the deep end, but watch. You have a race weekend, and you walk through the door Sunday night, and you can talk about the picture they drew today and what they've been doing at school. So I don't know, I've really enjoyed that about being a father. Poppy, I think, is starting to understand a little bit more. Tilly was a little set back, I think, after the Indianapolis crash, because she saw it a few times. She was, like, "Oh, did that hurt?" Or, you know, "Could you have been injured a lot more?" There you go. Can you throw me? You've got... You've still got more. No, Mommy is actually full up. Emma is... is a big portion of who I am now, how I approach races, how competitive I am. I was waiting... I was waiting for seconds. For me, I think, with her background as a runner, and a runner for Great Britain, you know, the training side, the focus, and mentally with her having gone through something like that to an Olympic level, it complements what I'm trying to do. I know, I said, cakes. She loves the sport, but she only wants me to win. Okay, put this down. Okay, let me get the cookies. Cookie batter. I was thinking about it. Maybe, you know, I do push Scott so hard or, you know, I focus so much on the race season, as in, like, diet and sleep and all that good stuff. Maybe it's... You know, I never did fulfill all my dreams, you know, as a runner. And I got a second chance with Scott to help him fulfill his. In sport, we're always looking for that little sign of how to make ourselves bigger and better than the next person. In running, you're feeling the pace of the people around you, and how heavily they're breathing. When is the right time to put that charge in and, you know, when people are suffering? I see Scott, he'll come round the top bend, and I already see he's lining himself up for the move. I can already see the one he's going for. And it might take three laps, but I know he's going for this one. It's so loud, and it's such a quick lap, because we're on, like, a short oval. It comes round super quickly. So they're back again. The competitive side of me, the athlete is, like, "Come on. Come on. Give it everything. Come on. You know, stay focused." But then it's two sides of the race for me. And the other is, like, "Please, God, I don't care. It's not about the win, I just... I just need him home." I better go. Love you, Daddy. See you after the race, right? Love you. Good luck, Daddy. Good luck, baby. Good luck. Thanks, baby. Good luck. So we're at a very dangerous point in the championship right now. We're eight points out of the lead, and we are surrounded by some extremely talented guys, and our biggest team threat is Penske. Anybody in motorsports is an underdog to the Penske organization. They have been the benchmark for many years. It's gonna be a really steep uphill climb, to try and overcome one of the best teams in history. Well, let's talk about Hélio first. Really fast. Probably one of the toughest guys to fight, because he's unpredictable. Then you get Simon Pagenaud. Very meticulous, calm, calculates everything he is gonna do, every move. He's really smart, so you've got to be careful, because he's just there. And then you have Will Power. How can you not be race car driver with a name like that? I don't think anybody can beat him in one lap. Josef Newgarden, the American kid. The American dream. The series is talking about, "We have all these foreigners, you know", Brazilians, New Zealanders, Australians, French, but where is the American?" And he's cool. You've got two fire-breathers. You have one that has all the experience, in Scott Dixon, and you've got another one in Josef Newgarden that's just getting ready to load up and go. Ready to roll for Road America. It's Penske on Penske at the start! Race strategy is a little easier with Scott, because he is the man when it comes to fuel economy and savings, and it's something two or three other drivers in this series may do, that I know of. And most of them are on Penske's. We had to be very calculating for every lap in order to get the most out of it. And Scott had to do his job. We had to leapfrog four cars to get to the front, at-at a very high speed circuit. And the pass that he made on Josef Newgarden at the end, showed you how much he wanted to win the race. A good run for Scott Dixon. The blue cars pops to the outside trying to go around the outside of Josef Newgarden. Side-by-side coming in to turn number one. Newgarden won't give it up, but Dixon is gonna grab the spot and takes the lead. Driving around the outside of somebody in turn one at Road America, that is like a carnival ride. There's nothing good gonna come out of that, but something good came out of it for us. Road America was pretty incredible. You saw it coming, because he was so far ahead, and Josef was right on him. But you're like, "Okay. Well, this is gonna happen." Scott Dixon, the master is going to take the checkered flag, win for the first time in Road America, and the first time in 2017. Okay. This is good. It's hard not to get emotional about it, because you put so much into it. I feel like there's a lot of weight on your shoulders at the start of a race, which makes winning feel so damn good. Scott Dixon. All right! Whoo! He won the Formula B National Championship at the age of 13. He's the youngest driver ever to hold an international racing license. Scott was always so determined that that's what he wanted to do. We had been in the media a lot, so people knew that we had really struggled to get Scott to where he got. And people would always say, "Your son owes you." He does not owe me anything. We protected him from the financial problems that we had, and we had a lot. You know, I used to work, I don't know, 40, 50 hours a week on my business, and 40 to 50 hours a week on Scott. And we tried to be as honest as we could with Scott, but we would keep him away from the slammed doors, the... "Not interested. Go away," or "No, motorsport isn't our thing." We borrowed money. I borrowed money. I borrowed money that even Glen didn't know about. It's like having a drug addiction. You can't stop. No matter what differences we have, and anything in life, but the pride of what he's done, and what he's achieved... And it doesn't matter who has been behind him or helped him or whatever, he's actually the one that's achieved the accolades, and how well he's done, you know. Yeah. I love him to bits. I really do. I remember watching him walk around the paddock in Nazareth when he was an Indy Lights driver, coming over to drive Indy cars. I remember he was the young-looking guy, and I thought, "Boy, does this kid know what he's getting into?" You know? And of course he won the race there in Nazareth. He was very shy, and, uh... and he was very shy for the first year or two, and it took a lot to coax him to come out of his shell a bit. I want Scott to be Scott, and-and-and... I'm okay with whatever that is. As long as when it's time to go fast, he can get the job done. And he knows he can do that. We know he can do that. There's a lot of different points through the weekend where... Where a split second can make all the difference. You've always got to be mentally calculating in your head, "What's the upside if we pit now? What's the downside if we pit now?" It's a bit like counting cards in Blackjack. You just try to get the odds in your favor, and then you make your bet. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. The goal is to win a lot more than you lose. You have to scrape together every single point possible. And all we can do that's do the best job that we can over stuff that's in our control. For the rest of the season, we need to be perfect. He's got to not think about me, he's got to put the children away, he's got to, you know, put his helmet on, and trust the people that he's racing against. He knows what he can do on the racetrack. He trusts himself, but he's also got to put that trust in the other 33 guys around him. That's what I would really struggle with. It's only one winner at the end of the day. It's either gonna be you or me. How can you trust somebody that is going after the same dream as you? And at the same time... at the same place? You got to choose who you can trust, and who you cannot trust. You work really, really hard for this perpetual motion machine, that's based on time. You know, racing is about a timetable. We're at six seconds in the pit lane, and you lose two or three tenths of a second over your neighbor, that bumps you back four spots. Think about that. Three to four tenths of a second moves you four spots toward the rear on a normal pit stop. He's in! He's in! He's in! The first stop, we came in, tires came off. Tires went back on. So Pat dropped the car, I went to send the car, Kyle has still got his wheel gun on the... on the right rear wheel. Scott Dixon, not as fast of a stop as you would expect for the Ganassi team. Simon goes by, Hunter-Reay goes by, Rossi goes by. You know, you're coming into the pits, you have in your mind, like, "Yeah, this is... This is a really good strategy." The guys are really fast, you're gonna gain a second here. "We're gonna, you know, leapfrog, you know, the three guys we were behind." Scott Dixon, he leads the points, but has had a very, very difficult day today. Oh, and now there's a problem on the left rear. Oh, my God! Man, Ganassi is struggling. They're ninth, 13th, 15th, and 17th. Josef Newgarden, he will take the championship lead for the first time. Josef Newgarden dominates in Mid-Ohio. We're sitting in 11th, like, an okay salvageable day would be sixth to finish. You put everything you have into this. You try to look at every avenue of how things are gonna work out, and then suddenly it doesn't. And it's something that's out of your control, and you feel completely helpless. And you walk away from the race just completely depressed or... Or just questioning why you're doing this in the first place. Race is done. You want to crawl under... A under a rock. You know, the whole team trusts you to perform. And when you get it wrong, it's just, you know, the weight of the world is on you. Yeah, whether it's putting Scott at risk on the track, something being wrong with the car, or you've just thrown away your chances of a win, it can be... Or a championship at that point. Like, if that was the last stop of the last race, and you were going for the championship, and you had that problem, then it's... you're the problem. You're the reason why you lost the championship, right? That's what people focus on. Couldn't really tell what he was doing in the middle. That's because it was turning the opposite way. Fuck, it was horrendous. We've had a couple of races that didn't go our way. I think where we're sitting is probably better than a lot of people expected... ourselves included... Um, going up against the Penske juggernaut. Leading up to Mid-Ohio we were three points in the lead. But the guys in front of us, Josef and Hélio, finished higher than us in Mid-Ohio, so that puts them ahead in the points. That just gave them enough of a lead to now we're eight points back. On the bench up there. So, oh, the antenna that came out.Yeah. All right. Thanks. Cool. I don't get the happy Scott without the winning on the track. And he gets the happy Emma, if he's the happy Scott, you know? We know that the drivers are gonna push it to the absolute limit. And, you know, the risks are large. He's won the Indy 500, and he's made some money, he's got a beautiful family, and it makes you wonder what keeps his drive that high. So, I mean, it's part of the deal. We're all at risk. You know, the boys in the pit lane. You know, when we're out there. I mean, I've known a number of drivers, of course, who have lost their lives. But... 25... Fucking hell. Um, it's not something you really... You know, you don't dwell on it, you know? Just don't like to... You know, you don't like to bring up... Bring up the painful memories of losing... losing your mates. What's that? A ten-count. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. All right. Can I get another ten-count? Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Okay. Anytime you guys are ready. Okay. Hey, everyone. I'm Lauren Bohlander. I'm Scott Dixon. Sorry, I'm Dan Wheldon. Driver of the Number 10 Target Chip Ganassi Racing Dallara Honda Firestone. Nice. A lot us where very tight with Dan. He was a big personality. But especially with the group I mostly hung out with... with Dario and Tony, and you know, we spent a lot of time together. Here they come down the front straightaway. And the final race for the championship is green. I remember being terrified the night before. Didn't go to sleep. There's the number 10 of Dario Franchitti. I think I was right behind Dario, and you know, there was the two of us that, kind of, sat on the bottom. Updating you as Tony Kanaan is still leading. But, boy, the action back behind him. He doesn't know what he's missing. You could tell right from the get-go, there was new guys, and other people maybe with, you know, with a chip on their shoulder that wanted to prove something. Oh, so close. And they're touching right there. A lot of times as a driver, you're in control of your own destiny. How much risk you're willing to take, how fast you go through a corner, to go faster, to distance yourself from the others. Looking for Dan Wheldon. Started 34th in this field. You know, you could tell right away there was something that was, uh, gonna go down. And sure enough... Whoa! Here we go! Trouble! Contact and a huge crash! Go low! Go low! Oh! Up at car number 2. Oh! Multiple cars involved. Onboard with Will Power, and he's in the air! I remember trying to brake, and I think it was Scott right in front of me. In all this commotion, all I was looking at was trying to not hit the car in front. And it all happened, I didn't see any of it. The debris, it was just scattered everywhere for, you know, a mile and a half of, you know, 15 to 20 Indy cars totally destroyed. I've seen, you know, many big accidents, you know, pile-ups, before, but I'd never seen a debris field like that. You know, there was a driver's meeting called. And at that point, that's not really normal. And the doctor came in and shook his head and... Well, at that point we knew Dan... was dead and... Don't ever say race car drivers don't have emotions, that they feel nothing. I've never seen so many race car drivers crying because we don't, like, really do that. But you don't see Scott Dixon cry ever. That guy... I mean... And some of the guys, we... We hugged each other, you know, like, you know, like as a group and... And there is... Tony, and... very distressed. And Tony just is a-a great friend of Dan and, um, they hang out together, has always hung out together... You know, we've heard all the lines. "He was doing what he wanted to do. He knew the risk." Uh, it doesn't make the blow any softer. Yeah. We miss Dan. I think the hardest part was probably getting to Dan and Susie's hotel room later that night, you know, and they'd just had Oliver, uh, their youngest. You know, and even Sebastian at that time would have only been, maybe two, I think. And, you know, totally oblivious to what had happened, what had gone on. You know, I was hurting too, you know, Emma was. But, you know, not on a level where someone had just lost their husband. You know, uh, the kids had just lost their father. You know, his parents had flown in and, you know, they'd just lost their son. I've had this discussion many a times, when people... like, when you lose friends, do you really think about giving up? It's the only time I've seen Scott cry is when Dan died. Is there another can, or is that the can? That's it. That is the the can of beans, Mr. Taggart. The guys are very goal-oriented, and they're very tight. They're a very good working group. But things can go wrong with any good group. And it's all in the recovery. So, how do you build your confidence back up when things go wrong? Or how do you ensure that you're still focusing on the right thing, or focusing not on the end goal but maybe on your process, and how you're taking each step. Go, Matt. Whoa! Whoo! Oh, tight! Whoo-hoo! They get frustrated and angry with each other because they're all perfectionists, and they want to win. So they'll get upset for a minute, and then they'll, uh, they'll think about things, and then bring their guys back together, and say, "As a group, we've got to get this back together." And they do. Welcome to Watkins Glen, another beautiful day here in mid-New York State. Obviously we're in a championship chase here with the Nine car. Let's do everything we can to make sure that that happens. Anything we can do... that's within the limit of the rules... I would appreciate you guys know what to do. I don't need to be telling you. We feel pretty confident and strong, and then something that we can't control starts happening, and it's the weather. The difference between a wet setup and a dry setup is massive. So, do we start with a wet setup? Because the ground is damp, and the sky is dark, and our weather says it's coming. Do we start with wet? Do we start with dry? Wet? Dry? Wet? Dry? We keep thinking about it, and everybody on the grid is thinking this too. So, Chris Simmons, he comes up with a decision to go with wet. And he has the guys changing gears, changing wings, changing chassis adjustments. Massive changes on pre-grid, we're getting called to the grid, and we're still changing gears. We were late getting to our grid spot, but the guys got it done, and it was the right call. If we hadn't, if we would have just raced what we had, we would be in back of the pack, and it would've been over. I can't believe that Chris Simmons can do this, as well as he can. You step back, and look, "I'm working with some really good guys." Watkins Glen International, the scene of today's Verizon IndyCar series race. The championship is at stake. Two races remain, and they're all chasing the 26-year-old from Tennessee, Josef Newgarden has won three of the last four races. Oh, boy, this is gonna be fascinating. Get ready. It's the IndyCar Grand Prix at The Glen. And Dixon determined to reduce that deficit that he has to Josef Newgarden at the top of this championship. Everybody is starting on wet weather tires, but they won't be on them for very long. Coming onto the front straight, here at The Glen, it's time to bring the action. Good start, Newgarden. Look at him on the inside. Three wide. Newgarden locks up. Can he keep it intact? He does, but here comes Rossi. Everyone comes down pit road, to get on the slicks. Charlie Kimball beats Scott Dixon out. So Dixon lost quite a few spots. Newgarden defends Dixon to the outside. Tough to go around the outside here Paul, under the inner loop, but he's already cleared him. Now he has gotten ahead of his championship rival. Now he's got to chase down Castroneves. Not a great stop for Scott Dixon. He lost two positions again on the pit stop exchange. He made it up, and now he's dropped back again. Yeah, Josef got us on that pit stop. Come on, Scotty. Will Power has the pit out location. He's squeezes around. Josef Newgarden, the championship leader in the orange and white car, he's gonna have to get around Will Power coming out. Final stop for the two Team Penske cars. And Josef Newgarden... at the same time... and it's a drag race to the line. And now we watch how they blend in. Josef Newgarden totally overcooked his pit exit. - Oh! Against the the wall. Oh! He gets hit! Suddenly, out of the blue, you see in the corner of your eye, you see one of the cars on the TV wreck in pit lane. You see it's Josef. You think, "Oh, my goodness." I hate that that's happened to those guys, because you want to beat them on merit. But he just screwed up. So... So you get really excited. We thought it was gonna rain the whole race, we've had a nice, clean dry race from the start. Man, big drama show today for the Penske Team. Enormous. Rossi wins at The Glen. Over Scott Dixon, this championship has tightened way up, with one race to go. We're in the fight. Yes, we are. I didn't... I never thought we weren't. Yeah, no. True. We're still in the fight, I should say. Good job, boys. Thanks, man. Sorry we didn't get the win, but... No, it's all right. Scott Dixon finished second. But Scott, more importantly, you are now just three points behind Josef Newgarden heading into double points at Sonoma. What does that mean for your race in two weeks? Yeah, definitely good, uh, good recovery by the team. Ended up second. Good points. Uh, it's definitely gonna be close, coming down to the wire here for Sonoma, which I expect nothing less for the Verizon IndyCar Series. So, I don't know, we're gonna have to up our game at Sonoma, and see if we can, you know, carry away another championship trophy. That was a good result. We took a big chunk out of Newgarden's lead. All I know is we've got to beat Newgarden. So many times in sports, you have this, sort of, confluence of people, and of timing, and of equipment, and of the sport itself. You have this, sort of, coming together at the right time. And Scott is somebody that wins with the team and loses with the team, and I find that very refreshing in today's world. No, I haven't spoken to the girls yet. We should call them quickly. We were all young kids that have known nothing but racing. Remembering where you came from, in this business, defines who you are. My first memories go back to when my dad was racing. Being in the pits after the races. The... Pretty young back then, three or four years old. Next thing you know, we're building our own engines, and have two cars for me, and two cars for my brother. And it was a real family sport, and we traveled all over the country. Race has been part of my life since birth. It's always been in my family. My dad started taking me to the racetrack when I was really young. Sleeping on the back of the trucks, you know, showering at the track, kind of thing. Not getting a hotel, not eating anywhere fancy. It was a really kind of gypsy lifestyle. It starts out with a love of the automobile. The kid across the street from me growing up had a very, very fast go-kart. And that began the fire for me in my belly. You know, I wanted to drive that go-kart. I can't think of anything I'd rather be doing than this business. But, uh, no, lots of sacrifices you make. You know, I've been divorced. You know, my daughter, who had the question from her at times about, uh, you know, maybe I wasn't at a particular place while she was growing up. You get to a point in your career where you think, "How do you best serve the sport that you've grown up in and you love so much?" Today, I'm in it to win races and win championships, and provide some return for our partners and sponsors, and take this group of people that I'm lucky enough to work with, and you know, provide a valuable livelihood. Everything in life is a trade-off. But, hey, let's face it. Winning is a hell of a lot of fun. You know, when you win, I mean, that's big. Yeah, and you know, who better to do it with than the guy I'm doing it with? Well, you talk about a Sunday drive. It's been that for Scott Dixon today. A lap to go. Here comes Dixon. Even at nine, 10, 11, I would still wake up at, you know, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning to watch the Indianapolis 500. The speeds were excessive, you know, 230 miles an hour. The style of racing and how many passes were going on, uh, to how many different people had the opportunity to win. That really intrigued me. And 2008 is the year that stands out, uh, in my career. Um, Emma and I get married in February, win the 500 in May. And here's the winner of the 92nd Indianapolis 500-mile race. Scott Dixon from New Zealand. To win the Indianapolis 500, it's such a strange feeling. And to actually be in that moment, you know, we've just won, you know, the biggest race in the world. The 92nd 500 winner, Scott Dixon. The man from New Zealand who takes the Borg-Warner trophy here at Indianapolis. The steps that we'd taken from, you know, starting in go-karts to where we had got to as a group, as a family, it magnified what it was all for, and why, you know, there was blood, sweat and tears put in, you know. Not just from me, but from many people. I think when you're talking about the greatest drivers of all time, he may be there already. Racing has been pretty much my life. You know, we have a passion for competition, and, uh, any day we don't win is, you know, we haven't... we haven't completed our goal. Hi, Tilly. What are you doing? Good. How was, uh... How was school on Thursday and Friday? How did... How did that go? Oh. Well, we'll see you in a day or two anyway, babe. I know, we'll try and... We'll try and win. We'll be trying to win. Going into Sonoma, coming off Watkins Glen, we're three points back. We knew we had our destiny in our own hands. If we could win the race, we'd win the championship. That was somewhat unexpected, and a good feeling. But, uh, we also knew that we were gonna be challenged. What a beautiful picture. Sonoma Raceway, hosting the 17th and final round of the Verizon IndyCar Series. It's one of those tracks where I would say, performance-wise as a team, we haven't really always excelled there. It's a Penske strong track. You know, it's gonna be a really steep uphill climb to try and overcome, uh, four very good cars, four very good drivers, and a, you know, one of the best teams in history. You've also got Josef, uh, and he's, you know, going in leading the championship. So it's a perfect storm for a great story. That idea that Scott, and that the car that I'm on, could win this championship... I've never been to that point in my IndyCar career before. It was nerve-wracking. This is why we're in this business. It's for days like today. Okay? All the preparation, all the work, all the sweat. All the effort that each and every one of us have put in all year comes into a focus today. It's an opportunity for great accomplishment. For more than one person, I might add, in this room. The only time you're gonna keep me out of that car, is either if I'm dead, or if I can't really do it, because a doctor tells me I can't. We live to race, everything else comes around that. Your family, your wife, your kids, everybody. They have to adapt to your lifestyle. It's much easier to call somebody a legend when they were... 20 years ago. But for somebody that's current is, I think, people struggle more to recognize just how good they are. Four championships so far, you know, that fifth championship would be incredible. I'll see you in a minute. I'll wait here for you. See you at the car, okay? Yeah. You have butterflies, right? It's the last race, and you have a legitimate chance to win this thing. It's been a terrific season. Very, very tight from start to finish. I've never seen it this competitive in IndyCar. There's so many things, so many scenarios I'm running through. It starts weighing on your mind. If we lose a lap, if we have an extra long pit stop, if the car fails on track, if we run out of fuel. And then you start thinking about all the prize money that everyone is depending on, is based on this championship. So it's an awful lot of responsibility and weight just sitting on your shoulders. It's the 17th, and final race in the Verizon IndyCar Series. It's championship day, and it's time to bring the action. Newgarden to the front. Nice clean start. Starting the race, the start of the race went well. Uh, past Sato, got up to fifth place. Josef Newgarden, Will Power, Hélio Castroneves, Simon Pagenaud, Scott Dixon. The championship five are in the top five. And then that's when the chaos started to happen. Whoa! Sato, the wild thing in the dirt. We're hearing a report that James Hinchcliffe may have left the track. He's way off the track. - Whoa! -Sideways on the red, dirt everywhere. The guys at the wall. What a wild opening lap. Just carnage. Big cloud of dust. Cars banging into each other. Everybody was slowing down. Kanaan is in trouble, I think. Kanaan has got bent suspension. Somebody hit him from behind. I think he's either got a flat tire... And Kanaan, the teammate to Scott Dixon. That is a huge blow for Dixon. He needs Kanaan in this race to help support the championship fight. Well, the first stop comes and goes. And we haven't changed positions much, relative to the leader. It was four Penskes versus Scott. Castroneves into turn Number 9 with Scott Dixon skulking just behind him, trying to close in. Oh, Scott Dixon just lit up the tires as he made a pass on Hélio Castroneves. You're hoping of something to switch it, uh, to try and switch the strategy up. But Hélio is right on us. He's been stopping every time we stop. They know our strategy. Penske covered all strategies. And then suddenly the race starts to just... No one is passing, no one is doing anything exciting. It's just a kind of a parade. I was doing all I could, and still hanging onto, you know, the last five laps of the race for something, you know, big to happen. I never give up. Scott never gives up. You have to be able to square up to the mirror at the end of the day knowing full well that you gave it everything you had. Scott Dixon, four-time champion, and it's looking increasingly difficult to be a five-time champion here today. And I think the point where you start to think, "Well, this isn't... This isn't gonna happen." It's not... You don't stop doing your job. You just... Your heart just sinks. And now you're just watching cars go round the track, watching somebody else... win the championship. Dixon's ability to make something happen is a miracle here, with half a lap to go. Simon Pagenaud wins in Sonoma. But Josef Newgarden is the 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series champion. It's a reality now for Josef Newgarden. Scott is a guy that unless he's going really fast, he doesn't feel alive. He feels euphoric when he's chancing death. Just as I was a seven-year-old getting in a go-kart, is that it's the same thing. It's a race against your fellow competitors, and you're trying to win. And that's... that's all it is. But there's so much more going on now. It's not wanting to disappoint. Whether it's my parents, my brothers and sisters, investors, you know, Emma, you know, the kids, people that have helped me along the way. Because I didn't give it my all, or because I made a silly mistake, because I didn't prepare well enough. Some days the reality exceeds expectation, and some days you accept the reality. Oh, well. Shit. Well done, baby. Thanks, babe. I'm sorry. It's fucking annoying. Hey, Scott! Hey, Scott! The best team won, I guess. That's all you've got to say. We'll go get them next year. Have a couple of beers tonight, and we'll start planning for next year tomorrow. It's all right. Next year. Congratulations on a great season, Scott. Yeah. Well done, guys. Congrats. Congratulations on a great season. You're the best. Oh, thank you. Well, do you know what? Next year it's all even... I'm so excited about next year already. I don't think it was meant to... I think it was meant to be this way. Do you? Yeah, I guess. I feel it. I love you. I'll be back at the truck.Okay. ♪ Well, my pad is very messy I got whiskers on my chin ♪ ♪ And I'm all hung up on music But I always play to win ♪ ♪ I ain't got no time for lovin' 'Cause my time is All used up ♪ ♪ Sitting around creating All that groovy kind of love ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm a man, yes I am And I can't help But love you so ♪ ♪ Oh, I'm a man, yes I am And I can't help But love you so ♪
