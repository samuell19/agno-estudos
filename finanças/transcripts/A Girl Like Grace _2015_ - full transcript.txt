They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. They also say that beauty comes from within. When I was a little girl, I used to turn on the television loud to block out the noise around me. We didn't have cable, but... the sound of static was better than the screaming. It all started with me being raised by my single mother. She always thought of herself as this beautiful, Haitian queen. I'm not gonna do this shit with you. What're you gonna do, huh? You ain't nothin' but a bitch of a man! - I'm not afraid of you! - You want to fight me like a man? I'll treat your motherfuckin' ass like I want. Don't move! Bitch, you lucky I didn't break your motherfucking jaw. Stupid bitch. Fuck you. I'm sorry, baby. Your mother is a beautiful woman but I hope to God you don't grow up to be like her. You motherfucker! I guess when beauty doesn't come from within... ...you can call that... ...chaos. My name is Grace and this is my beautiful life. The problem is I never thought I was beautiful, nor did I ever feel beautiful inside. I used to ask God, "why did he have to make me a girl "to even have to care about beauty?" Now I just ask God, "why should I care about anything at all?" Best friends forever! Dink! You ready? You and that damn mouse. That thing needs to hurry up and die. I know, I shouldn't be talking about your little friend like that. Is that how you're going to school? Aren't you excited about your first day of your senior year? You need to move on with your life, Grace. We come into this world alone... and we leave alone. Girl, do you hear me talking to you? Yes, I hear you. Good. I'm working late tonight. And then I got a date, so dinner's on you. Bye. I was always told my name, Grace, meant something. That eventually my name would remind me of who I am and what I would need in order to survive in this world. But I never imagined my senior year to be like this. Alone. I go where I want to Oh, oh When I'm with you I smile and I know It'll be okay 'Cause I can fly away Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh... In this beautiful life, I'm starting to think that people take themselves too serious. It's like all they care about is who they hang out with, how they look or who has the latest iPhone or newest pair of Jordans. It's all about... being... cool. But inside... I bet they feel like shit. If people were to walk around the way they actually felt inside? I'll bet we'd all just be a bunch of dead zombies walking this earth. Welcome back, students! Hopefully, everyone had an amazing summer spending time with loved ones. I want you all to think seriously about college. College education is the surest way to a better life. On a more serious note, I'm sure that you're aware that we experienced tragedy over the summer with one of our students. May I remind you that we have a "zero tolerance for bullying" policy. Everyone, please respect and support one another. We're here to help. Here's to an amazing first day and a stellar coming year. Go, Admirals! Oh, my God, can you believe we're seniors now? This is so exciting! I am so excited for prom. Remember when we were ninth graders, and they used to call us scrubs... Grace: Regardless of what other people's opinions are of others, I could say I got to witness what real beauty looks like from the inside and out. I just wish she would have known. Welcome, seniors. My name... is Mr. Walsh. I am your Honors English teacher this year. Before any of you determine whether or not you like me or anyone else in this class, let's take a moment to properly introduce ourselves, shall we? Starting with you. Ms. Weathers? Let's see here, you and your daughter... Ms. Weathers. Did you understand that, Ms. Weathers? Yup. Makes sense. I bet. You know, I just, uh... I just need a little help, that's all. If I have to call Obama myself... Tell you what. Why don't you come back next week like we discussed, bring all the paperwork, and, uh, we'll see what we can work out. Sounds real good. You mind if I ask you a question? Uh, sure, go ahead. How old are you? Old enough. That's all that matters. Take care. Please allow me to introduce you to Mr. Matthew Clifton, our teacher's aide. Now, please fill out the information sheets. And remember, this is a very important year. So please work hard. I'm gonna need your cooperation and, of course, the support of your parents. So don't even think about putting any fake information down for your parents. I will find them. Okay? When you're completed with the forms, please pass them up to the front. Excuse me. Hey, Grace! What's up? How are you? How you doing? What are you doing here? Uh, yeah, I know I look like a loser, huh? No, um... I didn't have enough money to go to Emerson this year. So I decided to stay here, you know, work at the school, make some extra funds, and, you know. And, uh, save up for next year. You look good. It was a long summer, huh? One, two, three... I almost sharted on myself. Matt, stop. That's disgusting. Whatever, girl, you know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone. You gonna miss me when I'm gone, too. No, we're not. That's a lie, actually. I'm gonna miss those rides home from school, but that's about it. Yeah well, as long as you takin' care of our little Gracie, here, you're good. Grace needs to take care of me. What do you mean by that? You guys are stupid. How you holding up? It was good seeing you, Grace. All right, Jason, since you're a senior and a transfer student, I want to make sure you go to the counseling center. And over here is the auditorium, and then over there is the cafeteria. Mr. Walsh! Let me talk to you. - Yo. Who's that cutie? - Man, that's Grace. She won't be cheering for us, boy. What you mean? She on the other team. Other team? That new boy in school, Jason? Super hot. I love that song. We used to sing that song all the time. That was like old times. Y'all used to skip lunch. Yeah. That was like old times. Thanks for the ride. Yeah. Of course. Yeah, you know, Andrea would want it like that. Matt, it'll never be like old times. Why would you say that, Grace? It's like, all summer you ignore me. And now, you know, I come back and you're cold to me for no reason. - Like, why are you-- - Matt. Matt. Just stop. Please. I'll talk to you later, Matt. It's true. People like to forget the past that has affected them the most. But I could never forget. It's okay, girl. I know I'm beautiful. Jesus told me so, because that's my homeboy. Holla. Okay? But your mom? Oh, my gosh. She's, like, the black version of Marilyn Monroe, and that's true beauty. You ever wish you could look like her when you grow older? Okay. Here's your coffee. You've got your cups right there. Hey. I'll be right with you. Grace, what are you doing here? I told you I was working late. Shit. I asked them for an extension. - Damn it. - I'm hungry. Just go over there and sit down. I'll get you something to eat. God. Fuck you! Douche bag! I know who you are. It's Grace, right? You were my sister's best friend. How'd you know? She sent me a bunch of letters with pictures of you guys in 'em. She said you were her "new sister." How come you weren't at the funeral? I mean, if I had a best friend that died, I'd be at her funeral. I'm sorry, did I just invite myself to your dinner? Oh, it's-- It's fine. That was really sweet of you. My grandmother said you're a really sweet girl. How's she doing? Well, she stopped talking. She's getting more ill. But that's why I'm down here to take care of her. You know? It's the least I could do. I see you made a friend. - Share, this is Lisa. - She means her mother. Oh, nice to meet you, ma'am. Nice to meet you, too, but please call me Miss Lisa. Miss Lisa. I'm, um, Andrea's big sister. Andrea? Rest her soul, she was a lovely young lady. Yeah, she was. Grace, I'm getting off. I'll meet you outside in 15 minutes. So we should probably exchange numbers and hang out, you know? Just get to know each other. - Butch, I need some help. - What's up, baby? I'm a little strapped for cash. What can you do for me? Oh, what do you mean? What kind of cash? How much you need? I need just a couple hundred. Can you help a girl out? "Just a couple of hundred." You know I'm good for it. Come on. - Please? - All right, baby doll. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Butch. - Take the whole thing. - Really? - Well, yeah. - Thank you. All right. I'm gonna make sure that the lights are turned on by the morning. Girl, you can tough it out for one ni-- Are you? Don't be rolling your eyes at me. And you know, if I don't come home, that means Chad and I had a good time! I miss you, Lisa. Is that right? Damn. You're so beautiful. Let's get a hotel tonight. Now, Chad, you know I ain't no hooker. Nor am I cheap. You know I love you, girl. If you think all these compliments is gonna get you some ass, you better open your wallet. I mean, I'm just glad you decided to come see me tonight. Well, any woman who would pass up on a seafood dinner is a dummy. Lisa. Let's get back together. Chad, you know that ain't gonna happen. Why not? Because you ain't ready for a relationship. Yes, I am. Chad, please. You know I love you. And the sex... The sex is real good. But I can't keep going back and forth with you and your bullshit. - Bullshit? - Yeah. Bullshit. Why don't you answer it? Because it's not important. Tell your wife I said hi. How are the kids? I am in the process of getting a divorce-- I'm not buying that. - Just calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. - It's my damn mouth. - We're trying to eat here. Then you eat, bitch! - Lisa, stop. - Fuck you! Grace? Gra-- Grace? What? I can't sleep. Don't ever trust a man. Ever. Your father was the first man that taught me that. I want you all to write a poem about yourselves. Everything about yourself that's important, write it down. What if there's nothing important? Then write down what "nothing important" feels like. Listen, guys. It's not that complicated. It's just a poem. Okay? Grace, can I speak to you? So, I hear you're smart. Smart? How do you figure that? I have connections. When you filled out the information sheets, you were the only one who didn't fill out information about their parents. That kind of stood out, so... I did my own research. Is that legal? When it pertains to your education, it is. I see you got a 1539 SAT score. And I also hear you want to be a writer. That's pretty impressive. What colleges have you applied to? Actually, I'm not going to college. And why is that? So we have to go to the same college. Yes, we have to. You're smarter than me, so hopefully we get into the same college. Don't say that. Or if we don't get into the same school, we can stay behind and be strippers. Imagine that. Or we could just live with my sister. She would love that. Either way, we're gonna be together forever. How about I've already made my decision? So, Grace? You're really planning on not going to college anymore? I mean, that doesn't make any sense. Well, you're not. Grace? Listen. I'm really sorry about your friend Andrea. It must be really hard for you not to have your best friend around anymore. You guys were... really connected at the hip. - Aw! - Mary, knock it off. Matt? Get a life. You're not even supposed to be here. Or in this conversation. Yeah, dude. Get your shit together. Aren't you supposed to be in college or something? - Yeah, don't worry about me. - I'm afraid I am. Seems like someone here is obsessed with our little Miss Grace. Like I was saying... I know you think I had something to do with it. - But I didn't. - Well, if you didn't then why did you even have to say that? Because I know you think I had something to do with it. And she had nothing to do with it. Preach. It's okay, Grace. You'll find yourself another girlfriend. There are plenty of lesbians at our school. She's such a bitch. Hey, Granny. Okay. Let's see. This beautiful life I live. This beautiful life I live with tears I cry from inside and the misery of my only reproducing pain. Let me call you back. Can I help you? Hi, Miss Lisa. I, uh--, I was coming to pick up Grace to hang out for the night. - On a school night? - Well, not-- I wasn't gonna keep her out late. I just... I've been really lonely, - and so I was hoping-- - Grace. Grace! You two have fun. - Okay. - And be safe. - Yes. - Bye, Lisa. - Sharon? - Oh, it's Share. You ain't no lesbian, are you? Oh, no. No. I'm-- I'm far from that. Good, 'cause Grace here needs to meet some boys and have some fun. If you know what I mean. Yeah. Bye. Yeah, I know what you mean. Oh. Keys. Yo, your mom was hilarious. What language was that she was speaking? Uh, she's Haitian. Oh, y'all Haitian? - Yeah. - Wow. Wow, that's crazy. How come you didn't call your mom "Mom"? 'Cause-- I don't know. She never really felt like a mom. Thank you for hanging out with me. I know it's kind of random, me calling you. But you know, I really did need someone to hang out with. It-- It's okay. Okay, so, let's get out of the car. Why'd you park right over there? I-- I don't want them to see the car. They have, like, cameras and shit. So I'm just hoping that he's not lying, 'cause if he's lying, I'm gonna be really pissed off. It's not like I can be mad if he's lying because we're not "together together," But still-- - Hello? - What's that? Hold up. Get off your phone. Well, I guess you win that pot. - Okay, I-- - Didn't I say to get off the phone? What, you can't listen or something? They're gonna hear us out here. It's gonna-- Hi, Billy. Share, what are you doing here? I... So you weren't lying? Hi. Uh, what are you doing here? I knew that you guys were having a guys' night, but I was in the area, and so I just wanted to say hi. Well, you-- you can't just show up like this, all right? You're just gonna stand there? I'm okay. - Just sit down, Grace. - Sit down. What? I'm just trying to get back to normal. I've been really sad and you make me really happy. Do you have any drugs? Come sit down. What's your name again? - Grace. - Grace. - You smoke? - Grace, huh? Grace, that's a pretty name. Yeah, how old are you? - I'm 17. - Nice. - Yeah. - Cool. I'm Rod. Lisa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. She's off-limits. You want a drink? - Oh, no, thank you. - Why not? Because I'm not thirsty. Oh. Well, I am definitely thirsty. I said I'm thirsty. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. Appreciate that. Oh. Mr. Bartender, bartending at the table. Are you going to share that? Well, I'm thinking this is the real reason - you came over here. - No. I came to see you. Grace? Oh, I'm-- I'm all right. Yeah, I know. Drugs are bad. So am I. Change. You have to breathe it in slow. You're only gonna get more high like that. You're funny. It's okay. It happened to me the first time I did it with my sister. - Who's that texting you? - Just a friend. - So, did you have fun? - I mean, if you call watching you and your boyfriend make out "fun." Gosh, he's not my boyfriend. He's more like my drug. For now. You know, I can see why you and my sister hung out. You're really cool. Thanks. Five, six, seven, eight. Work, work, work that cherry. Work it to the beat. Now pop, pop, pop that cherry. Make it feel sweet. Now drop, drop that cherry. Don't you want to eat, eat? Now pop, pop, pop that cherry. Make it feel sweet. Now drop, drop that cherry. Don't you want to eat, eat, eat? Don't you want to eat? This ain't workin'. I don't like it. Something's wrong. - And it's you. It's her. - What? -What? -You're messing up. You're not even committing. - Fine. Okay. Okay! - Fine? No. "Okay. Okay. Okay!" - Commit, bitch. Commit. - Okay. This ain't no game. Grace! Grace! Grace, right? Yeah, you. - Shit. - I didn't like it. Don't be huffin' and puffin'. It's her. - How do you know my name? - Um... it's not hard to find out someone's name that you're interested in. I'm Jason. What is he doing talking to her? Not to be mean or anything, but you kind of suck out there. Thanks. I was just jokin'. You're supposed to laugh. Well, I guess I'll-- I'll see you around. Yo. Is that girl really weird like everybody say she is? - Who, Grace? - Yeah. Bro, you can't tell? She's, like, really weird. Weird? She's cute as hell. Yo, you guys really need to know the facts before you start talking about people. Matt, I know that's your friend and all, but you know the truth. Yo, Anthony, I'd be quiet if I were you, all right? Wait, wait, what're y'all talkin' about? Look, she was already weird. But last summer, her girlfriend killed herself, and now she's weirder. Yo, that wasn't her girlfriend. That was her best friend, all right? What you gonna do about it? I'm just saying what everybody already knows. Really? You don't go here anymore, Matt. You're not a senior anymore. Remember? Yeah, I remember. I'mma act like I didn't see that. Why don't you get out of here and stop talkin' all that shit? Why don't you get the fuck out of here and stop talkin' - all that shit. - Wow. Um... Yeah. They say you're really close with Grace. Is that stuff they say about her, is it real? If you want to get to know her, why don't you get to know her for yourself and stop listening to these knuckleheads? Hey, Jerry. Hold on for a second. Hey, ma'am, you can't smoke in here. Oh. Thank you. Jerry? Hey, buddy. Yeah, hold that appointment for me. Okay, thanks. So am I, uh... am I gonna get the food stamps? Looks like you are gonna qualify. Yay. Um, you're-- You're not gonna get the max because it's just you and your daughter. But you should be receiving something - really shortly in the mail. - Okay. So, I have some forms I need you to sign. Right here. Go ahead and date it. Wait, is that right? Every digit. All right, I'mma call you. Good to see you. Take care. In this beautiful life do we fight the vultures that attempt to kill beauty or die as they prey upon us? It's just not fair. What do you mean it's not fair? Everybody's always making fun of me about everything. About the way I look, who I am. I just feel like I don't fit in. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear. No. No. Andrea. Don't-- Don't talk like that. What's the point of being here if no one sees me for me? I see you for who you are. I'm your best friend. Grace, do you think I'm beautiful? It's okay. You can be honest with me. Yes, I do. I think you're beautiful. Do you? Grace. Hey, what're you doing? Um, just finishing some homework. Well, looks like we may be getting some food stamps. You better thank the man upstairs, because otherwise you'd have to go out and get a job. You know, once you turn 18 you're officially an adult and I officially don't have to take care of you no more. You know, I met a-- I met a cutie. He's a little young, but we'll see. Mmm. How was last night? Cool. Did you have fun? Something like that. And, uh, Sharon... It's Share. Share, Sharon. She looks like she's holding up with her sister being gone and all. I guess. I think it's good that you hang around with a girl like that. Her being older, she could be a good example-- I don't need any examples. Everybody needs examples. If-- If something is broken, how do you know how to fix it? Exampled. You understand? You're not the only one that's smart around here. What are you writing? A book? About me? Hello? Yeah, no, I'm just... I'm just doing some schoolwork. Yeah. Can I call you back? - Thanks. Okay. - Who was that? Share. She wanted me to come with her to look for a job. You should go. I have homework. It's Friday night. You got all weekend to do your homework. Well, I want to finish it now. Girl, go have fun. Do you know what I did when I was a senior? Girl, I don't even wanna tell you. All I'm saying is you should go out and have some fun. All right. Let's go! No, thank you. Come in. It's a porn shop, don't be so prude. Hello! Ooh. - Can I help you? - I'm looking for a job. What kind of job would that be? A job like this. A job. You ever worked in the entertainment business before? So do I have the job? She looking for a job, too? No, only I'm looking for a job. Grace. Grace? Who's that? Um... I knew that looked like you. Yep. It's me. So, um, what are you guys up to? Um, just hanging. - This is... - Share. I'm Grace's new best friend. Hey, Share. So what're you guys up to tonight? Uh, we're not doing anything. What are you doing? Just got to help my mom. But after that, nothing at all. Well, you should hang out with us. Is that cool with you? Uh, hold on. Where are we going? Girl, it's a Friday night. We can find something to do. I mean, damn, I got to teach you kids everything? Um, I got an idea. Why don't you put your number in my phone, and we'll call you later and we'll pick you up and we'll figure out something to do. Okay. - Cool. - Cool. So, uh, I'll see you guys later? You sure will. All right, Grace. Damn, girl. He wants you. He flirts with everybody. I brought you flowers. And your favorite gin. I hope you're hungry. Get out of here! Get off! Get... I'm not getting off of nothin'. Now, look here, now, you're gonna stop pushing me away, 'cause I'm gonna finish doing what I'm doing, you hear me? Hey! Come on, guys. Do you even know anybody here? Yeah. There's a few old friends. Is that Grace? - Holy shit! Damn, girl! - Oh! Oh, my God! - What? - Oh, my-- You scared me! You're back? What the-- Oh, God, I would've punched you. Shit, let's get a shot! - Let's get a shot! Whoo! - Come on! - Is that Jason? - That is Jason. You want to dance? - Oh... - Come on. No worries. No worries. Yeah! Ha! Whoo! Who is that that you keep texting? I promised I wouldn't tell. Nah. But you tell me everything. This I can't. Do they go to our school? Maybe. - Is it a boy? - Yes. Okay. Boo! I know, I work here now. It's weird, huh? Hey, Grace. Oh, sorry, did I interrupt something? - No. - No, you didn't. Cool. So, I was wondering what were your plans for the weekend? Um, I don't have anything planned as of now. Excellent. 'Cause I was also wondering if you'd like to hang out with me. Maybe. Cool. So it's a date. - Okay. - All right. - Hey, Jason. - Hey. I heard you're going to that party this weekend. - I am. - Great. I'll see you there. I got the job! I got the job! Oh, my gosh. Now we can celebrate. 'Cause I can pay all my freakin' bills! Share, you know it's a school night. Yeah, I know, but we don't have to leave to celebrate. Is your mom home? - She's at work. - Good, okay. because that means that we can, um... take shots! Come on, bitch! You cleaned up? You hungry? I'm fine now. What? Nothing. I can look at you all I want. I made you. You all right? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? I'm just asking. Any cute boys in school? Lisa, why are you asking me this? I think it's time you start acting like a normal girl. You mean be more like you. Wow, this is wild. That's how they do it here, huh? Sure. Hey. Hey, Jason. When you're done with that, you should come hang with us. Yeah. Sweet Cherry Crew really knows how to throw a party. - Say what? - Hey. Mary always needs attention, doesn't she? Enough talking about trash. Please. I'm happy you came here with me tonight. I really like you. You know that, right? You want to get something to drink? - Uh, sure. - All right. - Hey. - Aww. You two love birds! So cute. Don't worry about me. I'm gonna make my own party, okay? Look how cute he is! Cheers? Wait, you have something on your lip. Hold on. It worked, right? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Look at Share. I love that girl. You know, ever since I met Share, it's like... - Yeah, get down! Up, down! - I feel alive again. Down! Down! Down! Further! It's crazy. Oh, oh, oh, oh! How do you feel since you've met me? I don't know. I'm still feeling that out. Still feeling, huh? That's a good thing. - Damn, he's about to get it. - Shut the fuck up. You're so different from the other girls around here. So, when you lost your virginity, did it hurt? So what you call me over here for? Not really. Honestly, I didn't even like it. It didn't feel good at all? No. I wish it did. Maybe you should try it. See if you like it. Maybe you should have sex with Matt. That's gross. He's like my brother. Matt would die if you had sex with him. He's, like, so obsessed with you. Okay, if I tell you something you promise not to tell anyone? Promise. You remember that boy I told you about at school? Yes. You promise not to tell anyone? Because if this gets out, I'm dead. Okay. I promise. Look, remember what you used to tell me. Just keep walking with your head up high. I mean, none of them matter anyways. They're all ugly on the inside. I see you're walking differently, Grace. Who loses their virginity on a beach? Sandy, ashy hoes. Sandy, ashy hoes! Sandy, ashy hoes! Sandy, ashy hoes! Sandy, ashy hoes! Sandy, ashy hoes. It wasn't even like that. You fucking lesbian. - Boo-hoo, whore. - She's so ugly. We're not gonna save you, and no one is. Do you want to be a vampire, girl? Is that why you dress that way? You look so ugly when you cry. - You nasty. - Little stanky-ass ho. You're such a lesbian. You need to fucking die, bitch. Go away. Nobody wants you here. Nobody. You're fucking in my space right now. Grace! It's okay. I mean, if I were you I would just be happy that Jason gave you attention. I'd be a ho for him, too. Me, three. How the fuck could you do this to me? How could you do this to me? I'm ruined now! Andrea, why do you care what they say? Because I promised her! I care because I promised Mary! You're supposed to be my best friend! How could you do this to me, Grace? How c-- How could you? How could you? How could you keep something like this from me? Because you're not being real with me! You're not being real with me! You're not being real - with yourself! - What are you talking about? - We're best friends! - Do you want to be with me or not, Grace? Do you love me? Do you? I didn't think so. I don't know. It just... It just happened. What happened? The fight or the sex? The fight. The sex. Both. You know what, my dear, that is what you call life. I just... It just happened. I mean, how can you do that? I want to kill him. I told you about these guys. I told you that. I'm sorry. I'm not-- I'm not laughing at you. I'm-- I'm laughing with you. I'm... Come on. You have to laugh at stuff like this, or else it's gonna-- it's gonna eat you up. I don't know what to do. You know what, Grace, if I had let people judge me, if I had judged myself for everything that I did in Vegas, I probably would've ended up going crazy. I probably would've done the same thing that Andrea did. Hey, in this life, you're alone. You have to fight your own battles. And sometimes you just gotta say, "Fuck it." Fuck it! So on that note, was it good? - What? - Was it good, the sex? You're so silly. I'm sorry, I can't. - I can't do it. - Oh, come on. You're not doing it right. It's like this. I just keep saying how big they are? - Oh, my gosh. - Look! Look! And if they're, like, pinky-small, just say, "Oh, it's so big, Daddy." They like that. - Make them want me? - Make them want you. Make them want me? Make them want you! Okay! Make them want me? Are you wearing my shirt? Um, I was just borrowing it. What the fuck is wrong with you? All right, what do you want to do tonight? Let's go find some boys. Yes! Indeed! Um, can we have two Jamesons? - Yes, you may. - Thank you. Come on, let's dance. Let's get ready to get on the dance floor. The dance floor. Uh-oh! There she goes! Ooh! Thank you. To your first night as an adult. Whew! Okay, I... Hey. - How are you? - Huh? - How are you? - I'm good. - Patrick. - Grace. Nice to meet you, Grace. How old are you? - How old am I? - Yes, how old are you? I'm 20. Cool. You think I can take you out sometime? Um, depends on how long you can keep my attention tonight. Is that right? Careful, big boy. She's well-equipped. Baby, come watch TV with me. Where have you been? - Why do you care? - I said where have you been? Why do you care? I've been calling your ass. Why aren't you answering the phone? My phone died, sorry. - Your phone died. - Yes, my phone died. You can't just come in here any time you feel like it. And why can't I? Listen, I don't have time - for this right now. - Grace, I'm ta... Talk to me, then. Talk to me, Lisa. Wh-- Oh, you know what? Lisa, I got to fucking wake up in the morning. - Wait... - What do you-- what you doing? - What are y'all doing? - O-- Okay. Okay, okay. You trying to act like a good mother 'cause your little friend is here, huh? You know what, you're out of line! - Lisa, I'm gonna take off. - No, that's okay. Don't go, don't go, don't go. - Yeah, don't go, don't go. - Don't go, don't go. All right, I'm out of here. You need to stop drinking so much. Yeah, whatever. - What is wrong with you? - I don't fucking believe it. Got a girl who's crazy. What the fuck is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? I'm tired of you! Go. You want to go? Go. Bye, Lisa. Yo, it's too late to be out here. All right, let me know if you need anything else, all right? You know, Grace, I'm worried about you. About what? Matt, what do you want from me? It seems like you're obsessed with me. It's okay. Just admit it. Just come here, look. Stop being a creep. I'm-I'm just a guy that cares, that's... - That's just... - Don't touch me. Listen, Grace, I kn-- I know about you and Andrea. I know, and I-- I'm not judging about it. - But listen, you don't know-- - You don't know shit. Okay? All right. Maybe I don't. You know, listen, Matt. I appreciate you and everything you did for me tonight, but I'm tired. Good night. You know, Grace, I just didn't stay back in town because I had the... Because I didn't have the money, you know, to go to college. I also stayed back in town to protect you. You're a very special girl, you know? You mean a lot to me. Yo, where you going? I'm gonna give you a little piece of advice, Matt. Start worrying about your life. Not mine. Your friend's here. What are you doing here? I wanted to hang out. Mm. Well, there's nothing to do here, so... If she wants to stay, let her stay. We just chillin'. Oh. JoJo, why don't you roll up some of that kale for the princess? You want me? Huh? What's wrong? It's Grace. She's been acting up. I kicked her out of the house last night and I haven't heard from her. She's gonna be okay, Lisa. I've been a horrible mother. I've been a horrible mother. No, you're not. You just have to have faith. You are a wild one. What? I can't even remember what happened. Where do you want me to take you? Hey, Grace, what's up? This is Patrick. I had a good time with you in the club the other night. Looking forward to seeing you later. Peace. Thank you for dinner. You're welcome. So where do you want to go? You want to hang out longer? Um... Well, my friends are having a party at the hotel right there if you want to go. I mean, we could stay here if you want. Oh. No, it's... it's totally fine. I just have school in the morning. School? Uh, yeah, I'm in college. Oh, okay, cool. I just want to hang out longer with you, that's all. - Okay, okay, stop. - What's wrong? This is-- This isn't a good idea. No? I thought you were down. You're not down? Huh? Come on, I got you. I got you. - Okay. - Okay. What are you do... Relax. I know what you want. Let me go. - Let m-- - Relax. Just go with it. Stop. Get off me. Let go of me. Fellas, she's right in time for the party. Let go of me. Let go! Share, it's Grace. Please call me back. Please. Grace, I know I wasn't there for you. My grandmother died. I'm sorry. I've just been trying to figure it out. But I want to fix it. I don't think we should do this. These guys are gonna pay for what they did to you. Grace! Grace! Grace! Yeah. Come on through this way. Hey, I'm gonna call you right back. Hold on. - Oh, shit! - Get the fuck back! Everybody shut the fuck up! You think you could rape my little sister and get away with it? Where the fuck is Patrick at? Where is he? Oh! Hey! What the fuck? - Get out. I said get out! - Goddamn. Okay. Do you remember that girl? Huh? Did you rape her? Huh? Tell me right now, 'cause I can fix it. I'll fix-- I'll fucking shoot them in the fucking face! Are those the guys that raped you? Tell me right now! Is that the guy who raped you? Are these the guys that raped you? Evelyn, I don't know where she went. I don't know what to do. Bring her home safe. Please bring her home. Mom? Grace... Grace! Anyway, I wanted to give you this. What's this? Just don't open it before I leave. There's nothing really here for me anymore, so... Oh... Okay. See you later. This beautiful life. This beautiful life of mystery. This beautiful life can also feel like misery. Sometimes it-- it just doesn't make sense. Why are we on this never-ending journey to find beauty, while beauty never truly reveals itself? I once glimpsed beauty in a friend of mine. She was beauty, but the world denied it. And this beautiful soul that I denied, in taking her own life, took a part of me. My mother has been told she's beautiful her whole life. If you're beautiful with no soul, are you even living? Am I just a walking soul trying to emulate beauty like everyone else, only to have it destroyed by a man? A man once destroyed me. But when it's all said and done no one can break my spirit. This is my journey, and I will find my way. Even if I fall short of finding beauty, this beautiful life I long for will reveal itself, because it's out there waiting to be discovered. My name is Grace and this is my beautiful life. Do you know you're beautiful? * Today * I feel the same way * As an empty shell * Today * I feel * As lonely as hell * In my head * And I'm so tired * Of feeling * This way * And when I look at you * It makes me realize * I don't even know who I am * But maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find me * So maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find you * But for now * I'm still so lost * And I don't know * What's missing to me * But maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find me * And maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find you * And maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find you * I will find you * And maybe someday * I will find me, I will find me * * I know * It will take some time * But I'm ready * To do * What it takes * And I know * It won't be easy * To find my way * Out here * And I know * It will take some time * But I'm ready to do * What it takes * And I know * It won't be easy * To find my way * Out here * But maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find me * And maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find you * And maybe someday * Maybe someday I * Will find you * I will find you * And maybe someday * I will find me, I will find me. *
