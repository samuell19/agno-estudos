(Silence) (Silence) * I think Americans love Nutcracker because it's a timeless story. It's a story about generations, about families and children coming together. It's a story about a young girl's dream of growing up. Ah, about finding love and But it's not just a confection, there is, you know, Tchaikovsky's music. And there is that sadness to it. The children love to progress through the roles and to look forward to what they're going to be next year and the year after. You know you see the whole continuum, the life of, the creation of, a dancer. Bow. 1 and 2 and 3... 4, No. You're wrong. One more time. Guys, why you... you heard it. One more time, come on. Marat was star of the Kirov for almost 20 years. It was really a golden period for Russian Ballet. He was invited to come and guest teach in Los Angeles and I was a student in his class. That's when we met. The first time I went out with Marat, a Russian man came and sat beside me. And he said to me, You must take care of Marat he is Russian national treasure. In 1996 we did start as The Marat Daukayev School of Ballet We started with two students. I think I call myself Managing Director, and in my mind, I always say BARELY Managing Director (laughs) Before audition there is a great sense of nervous anticipation. On everyone's part, I mean I even feel it. So, I can only imagine what the children are feeling. Especially if they're hoping that this will be the year they're selected for an important role. But there's also the fling that it's a big party that's just beginning and everyone is looking forward to the beginning of Nutcracker. We audition and we see what the raw material is. It's sort of like making a painting and you know that it's got to fit on this canvas. And you know you've got these colors. We see the level at which all the kids are functioning in the school. Does this person have the mastery, to be able to... to do the role? Because Marat really doesn't like to reduce the choreography for the dancer. The dancer has to rise up. You know, this is our dilema because we are a school that's almost a company and Marat's life has been in a very great company . He's absolutely true to that standard of excellence. And the kids know that, they know it. And that's why they're inspired by him, that why they work so hard for him because they absorb that themselves. It's the slow accumulation of body knowledge over a long period of time. (director) The casting list just came out right this week (director) Was that a really hard decision? That's just one of the worst things about Nutcracker, is having to make that call and having to dissappoint... you know, a child... a family. We hate it. We dread it. (director) Why do you choose to email roles? This is a school, it's not a company. Posting the cast list on the board, where you have to hold in your tears and pretend that you're okay in front of your friends when you really want to go and cry in your bed We don't need to do that. Just to have the privacy to have your feelings or your moment of joy, that you got it! And that you can jump around and shout and do whatever you want and rejoice and not have to be cognizant of the fact that you got it and your friend didn't. There's sort of the assumption that, oh, you want to be a soloist, But to be in the corps is a very big deal. You're lucky to be in the corps It's a great experience and it's an honor. The corps means "body" it's the body of the ballet. Because, when you are looking at a group of dancers, Your eye goes either to the best one or to the worst one. They have to breathe with one breath. Every student has their individual path So impossible to say where it's going to take them. Elizabeth always had that star quality. When she was a little girl, she would come to the audition and walk across make a little curtsy for the director. I get up last, she wakes me up,. Usually I'll just eat at school I go to Beverly Hills High School. I take a full day, I also take P.E., very tiring. I walk to my mom's office, just like... rest in her car and wait for her to get out out of work and then 15 minutes before class, get ready, stretch a little, and then... ballet. Then homework, then sleep. (director) Do you have a boyfriend? No. (director) So, what role haven't you playedhat you would enjoy dancing? Tarantella is a fun dance, just so... brilliant. Well, of course Sugar Plum, but that's like, later in my life but.... Matisse is just, you know, she loves to dance. She has a great joy when she dances and I think the audience loves her, so much, for this. She has great expressive quality and fine feeling and a love of dance That really shines through her, when she performs. I've been here since I was 7 and I'm 13 now. (director) So what do you you hope to dohis year? What part? Sugar Plum. (director) Think you'll get it? I don't know... hopefully. I got the e-mail, and then so, I was reading the Sugar Plum list, and my mom, she didn't want to spoil it or ruin it, I got the e-mail and I was like. ooooooh it was just crazy and I started screaming and I left a voicemail and the whole voicemail was like, (Screams) And then I hung up. I think it's everybody's dream. I mean, I can't even believe it. I watched the first rehearsal yesterday and of course I was crying the whole time. And then, they did the death drop. I was having a heart attack and then crying. It was just so beautiful. It was just incredible. It's gonna be something else. It's an honor and she takes it very seriously. Finish. Stay. And Jump! No, no, no, don't make kneel. Stay, up. Only demi plié little bit. Yes, like this. That's it, stop. Uhhhh, guys, thanks so much. Yeah, we built a relationship with the girls, it's fun. It's fun. Mikhael is, uh, very hard on himself. I meahe's so... handsome. And he's so... beautiful. And his line, If he would stop criticising himself, it would help him so much. We call him hungry boy because he'll eat a great big bowl of pasta, like that, and say, Is there any more? and then he'll have a second one and then he'll have a salami sandwich and I'll come down and then he's eating Cocoa Puffs! I'm like, "Oh my god Mikhael!" Good thing you're growing two inches a week, Otherwise, you'd be busting out of your tights. (laughs) (director) What do you hope to play this year? Uh, Spanish. (director) Do you know yet? Uh, a little bit of it, but ...I don't know. (director) Do you know that's what you're playing? No, I don't know yet I'm just hoping. Yeah. (director) So you don't have time for much else. No. I get, I mean, I get invited to lotof parties. And it's like, I can't go, I'm sorry. It really sucks. Sorry, gotta go. I mean you have a lot of friends at the dance studio. A lot od friends. See you' not that much taller. Okay. (laughs) You see, it's always a competition. (director) It's like a big family. (director) Been together for so long. Especially like all the boys, too. 'Cuz before I was the only boy. You know, but now you have someone to, like, share your feelings with, and stuff. My mom's okay with it. You know, she loves me dancing and stuff. But my dad's a little... You know... Yup... He doesn't really I mean, he doesn't really approve as much as my mom does (director) Has he seenyou dance? Yeah. I don't think that's gonna change his mind though. Hopefully, it might, but... Mikhael is very concerned That his father doesn't approve. And I think that he looks to Marat For that acceptance That his father doesn't give him. He really does keep it separate There's the ballet school and there's his friendship with Marat's son Marat, Jr. And... when he invites him into his home, there's no talk of ballet it's all about family. So I thank God every night that I have that whole family that has welcomed him in because... it's tough. He's already worried about what he's going to say, That he wants to be a professional ballet dancer. He does. I just hope his father... Comes through. Edgar is such a talented boy and he has such passion for dance. Most other schools when you're a ballet dancer and as a guy, they tease you... a lot. And this school is actually an art school and everybody, like, dances... sings. I hated dance. I did not want to do it, at first. My parents were dancers, so I had to go sit and watch. My dad used to dance in Armenia. So did my mom. My dad was a teacher and my mom was a student. (giggles) Well, they wanted a better life for me and my sister So they moved here and I actually stayed there. I stayed with my grandma. I actually thought my grandma was my mom. Yeah, I did not know my parents at all until I came here It was hard, but we got through it Recently, I broke my foot. I fell from 16 feet. I was in the hospital for a week. Right now, I'm actually recovering. And my muscles in my foot are really weak. And I can't do all the things I used to do before. This injury was just, I mean I think the whole school felt devestated by it. Edgar appeared with his cast I remember the day he came back. and crutches in the doorway, you know, just a cheer went up from the students. I mean, he certainly has everything... everything. And he's just such a wonderful, wonderful boy. I mean, he is so loved. The doctor said I healed pretty quickly, like, quicker than I should have. So I actually might be doing Russian dance this year again. (director) The hardest part. (Giggles) Yeah. How Luis has grown. I remember he came to the studio as a little boy, basically accompanying his sister to the school. Which, incidentally, is how Marat started ballet, as well. Many boys come to the ballet as you know, just sort of coming along with sister. But he really has developed in technique and also in expression. After I got offered a scholarship with Marat I was 13 turning 14. I came from Guatemala. My mom, she's raised me. She leaves the house at 9:30 at night and she arrives She babysits from 10 'til 7 in the morning. She leaves her morning job then goes to clean a house. After that house cleans another house. Drive home, pick my sister up, drop her off at her school then drive to another house. Clean it up, maybe get home, sleep for 2 or 3 hours and then do the whole thing again. I owe a lot to her. She's just a very strong woman. This year specifically is very tough. It's like Luis, it's your year, your last year, before you audition for companies. The first 2 years were like, oh I'm dancing, this is great. Oh, I have a show...yay! Now it's like we have a show but, audition, audition... Company, company, company. That's my goal. (laughs) Once I got back from San Francisco this summer I started taking classes here and then Marat's like, well we have Nutcracker this season. If you stay, there's a high possibility of like, maybe you being our Prince this year. Prince, like, oh God. (laughs) Terror and excitement at the same time. (laughs again) * (applause on recording) I was young, I was like, 7. So, I was doing gymnastics, I was doing hip-ho I was... I just saw it as another activity. I wasn't serious about it until I was 11, I think. That's when I started figuring, figuring out what I wanted to do. How Adam has grown up, he's just, he's like a sponge. He's exceptionally coordinated. And he was a gymnast before he came to ballet so I think that really helped him a lot in that he sort of had an educated body. You know he, is a person who doesn't have all those self-doubts and questions about if he can and if he should and is he good enough. You know, he's supremely self-confident. And this is a great asset to him. He, you know he listens. I mean he doesn't always listen but you know he's a teenager, too. He goes through the period where he thinks he knows everything and then, you know, he realizes, oh, you still have something to teach me. I'd like to go to a classical ballet company first and then do a contemporary company. I want to go to one of those later as my body starts breaking down. (laughs) Marat always talks about amazing principal dancers who don't even need to play the principal roles to convey what they want to say as an artist. So, I mean, to be Prince would be great, to be Snow again would be great. Whatever it is, I'm good. (director) What was the family's reaction to Adam being cast as Prince this year or the first time ever at this school? Home grown. A lot of pride on my part. Been hoping since last year that it would happen. You know, maybe they'll cast him as Prince next year but when it actually happened we were both thrilled. You know he doesn't light up the room when he finds something like that out but I know inside he was very thrilled. I'm a sophmore there so it's my second year. LA County High School for the Arts. Bye guys, see ya. Bye. You can handle more than you give yourself credit for. Yeah, but, my body hurts. My body hurts, too, man. Yeah, I know. I just don't wanna... You gotta get used to it. I don't wanna get used to hurting myself everyday. I mean, what are you in this profession for then? Not hurting myself? There are more girls and there are more stereotypes about girls in ballet and the boys are kind of blazing their own trail. Depending on which train comes we might have to get off again. If the red comes first, we get on the red And then hop on the purple If the purple comes first, We just stay on the purple all the way down. The first time I did that, I got really lost. I got... I got really lost. To be honest people are pretty comfortable with it around me as far as I can tell. Kids joke around But it's all joking around you know? It's like oh, you're a ballerina. But in the end, I know I'm a "ballerina". Let's go to class. Eli has been with the school, for... really all of his dance career. He has all of the natural qualities that you would look for in a dancer. He has long legs, he has long arms and long neck. He has deep feeling. He's able to use his body as a vehicle for expression, and has come to that fairly early. He's coming through that period where he's, you know, getting the reins of his emotions in his... in his hands and you know he has everything that he needs to do what he would like to do with dance. I hope to be the Snow Prince this year. I've always been waiting for that. And I know, like, I'm too young to be the Prince Even though, like, that would be amazing. But, hopefully, next year. Or some new role. like, I'm always up for a new challenge. Something that allows me to express myself on stage. Ok so these are my white tights that I wear for everything. And um... it's really uncomfortable. 'Course these are my giant dance books collection. This one's from Marat actually. Wait, if I pull it out... and he's in it....right here. And he signed it for me. It's really special, I'm going to keep it forever. So in my closet this is my famous collection of warm-ups. But this one is the most special because Joaquin gave it to me. Joaquin De Luz from New York City Ballet. and Baryshnikov gave it to him and Baryshnikov wore it and Joaquin wore it. That's probably the most valuable thing to me that I have in terms of ballet. Seeing all the work that they do and how much they put in and I could see that they enjoyed showing all that work and I enjoyed, like, absorbing all that work and it made me look forward to what I'm gonna be capable of doing in the future. How high they jumped. How... their legs stretched and how their feet pointed. They felt like one person. They were one person together like, everything they did, they did as one. They were snug together... she wrapped around him, I was just like... was totally... driven by it. Kind of like my goal in one night, like, I saw my goal as a dancer. Performing on the stage on tour with an amazing company, with an amazing corps, with amazing principals and doing an amazing ballet with an amazing score. 'Cuz that's just, like, what it's all about. When we begin rehearsal, he's already almost mapped out the changes that he's going to make to the production by having seen the level of mastery that the students are at at this moment in time. So we have between 2 and 300 hours of rehearsal that has to be scheduled. Party scene, of course, has to be very well rehearsed because you have so many little children on the stage. And they really need to have a very good sense of the action and where they are and what they're doing. Make sure you're putting on a straight line right? We need to feel our friends next to each other. What else do we need to do? Um, you have to, like, follow the person in front of you. And make it straight. And 1, 2, 3, 4 and up, and down. Just yeah, just let's walk and see if we can follow lines. We're starting act 2, let's go, let's go. (unintelligible background) (director) You gotta go in there aren't you in act 2? Hold your back... good. And... center is right here! (squeals) (laughter) Um, let me give you to my mom okay? Javier? (gasp) He's so cute! Oh my goodness, Javier. He is a child who was just born to dance. We were so sad when we heard that, uh, that they were moving to Beijing. But they decided they would come back for Nutcracker. Oh... this is for you. Wow...I love it... thank you. It's the biggest Nutcracker I have ever seen. That's so awesome! How are you guys? And they said, you know e thing that we will miss most about Los Angeles is Marat Daukayev School of Ballet and dancing in The Nutcracker. He started in boys class and he was so focused and he had such good, uh, sense of tempo and rhythm And, and... coordination and he had such joy in dance and he just wanted to dance all the time. I came here to do The Nutcracker. And see my friends... all of my friends at the ballet school. I started ballet dancing when I was 4 years old and now I'm 7 years old so that makes 4 years. Four? In China if you want to take a class with a master teacher, It's merciless. I felt like it really was stressful and it hurt lots. But now I'm used to it. (director) Why didn't you give up? Cuz I needed to keep on trying. Quitters you can't get better. And it's my dream to be a famous ballet dancer. So I'm really working hard. I'm David Rishton. I'm 77. And I've actually since 1975, taken 5 ballet classes a week except one operation for a hernia. Marat invited me to play the role as the grandfather. So now it's year 12 in his Nutcrackers. I've learned a lot by being in his ballets, about ballet, I watch and look and listen. So I am grateful to Marat for this experience I'm having. It's great. I love it. (director) When did they rope you into being a dancing dad? First year. It was a smaller company even 5 years ago. Wasn't as many people in it and they said, Hey, we somebody to help. I wasn't actually asked when I first did it. I came home one day and my wife said, Would you like to be a dancing dads? And I said, well, okay, sounds like an interesting thing and she said, Good, 'cuz I already volunteered you. I have a son who's in level 2. I brought him to the first day of rehearsals figuring that the most complicated thing I'd need to do is sign him up. And I walked up to the desk and the woman said, Would you like to be a dancing dad? And I looked down at Walter and he was looking up at me like, Of course you would! so, um, basically I was roped right in, on the spot. But I asked, I said look, we don't do any dancing right, we just sort of mill around the stage... And they're like... oh yeah, no dancing, no problem. Of course then when the rehearsing started, it was a bit of a bait and switch, but... Eight step, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... and 5, 6, And then... like this, yes. And then they'll be a big, uh boys make like big circle. Got it. Alright? Okay, one more time. And a one... This is my first year. My first time, my first day. This is my first day. (director) How did it go? Very difficult (laughs) Very hard to remember. (director) What was the hardest step for you? The one that he doesn't know how to do. (laughs) I have to remember... Takashi, right, left, step, left, right, step, right, left, And now, change legs. I just was worried cuz I mean I've never done ballet or dance and I kind of expected someone to show me the steps before the whole thing started and everything just started. Like this, yes that's it. I just started following that guy cuz he was in front of me. People, people are not there to watch us. They're there to watch the children. We feel like the dads are just walking around on stage. You know for us, (laughs) Really the steps are almost nothing. I mean the choreography is so simple and so easily mastered. But I, I think this is just our lack of perspective on what non-dancing people consider dancing. When you're on stage and your daughter is on stage at the same time and you think about, you know that, taking off work early and all those things, you think, God, I'd do it all again, in a heartbeat. Because, you know, that one moment when she she looked at you and she... her eyes, you know, just caught your eye... for a moment. It's worth everything. (director) I can't keep from crying. I have to keep from crying, too. I mean I just keep wondering what other moments like that I'm gonna have in my life. There's not that many of them. The little ones are watching principals dance and learning how to pick up choreography and it's amazing how Marat will now come out of rehearsal and say, "First rehearsal, they know everything." And that's partly because we have tradition in the school that children have been through Nutcracker many times and they know all the dances. Too t) Mommy. Marat said that his teacher only told him Good Marat when he had already graduated moved on and was and was soloist and then principal at The Kirov and he said Good, Marat . Well, the teacher is there to tell you what to fix. (applause) The thing that was so amazing to my wife and I about this company and working on the Nutcracker... Our daughter is learning more from failure than success She didn't get moved up as quickly as some of the other kids. At first, it's hard as a parent because you are, "Hey! What about my kid! and, and... Then you really recognize that learning to succeed when you've failed... is a pretty important lesson. It's not even about dance at that point. It's kind of the zen of ballet. It's a vehicle through which you define yourself and define how you think about work, how you think about adversity, how you how you make yourself resilient how you come back from defeat. How you become the master of your mood so that when you are less than satisfied with yourself, you have the energy left to progress and to put it aside. That's all stuff that adults struggle with and they have to learn it so early. And so the discipline that they have here is what we're really looking for. The dance is extra, you know. And then being on stage is a bonus. So between all of it, it's um... it's unique. Where's the tape? We need tape on it. Make a muscle. (laughs) (unintelligible background voices) The hardest part of rehearsal is schedule. Because, once they're all there it's like a celebration. * (uninteligible) straight up! Go! Go, go back! Girls! * Mice stop! Stop!... Stop mice! Go! Next on music! Mice go! Mice go...mice go. (unintelligible background voices) * Your preparation is done in class. And, your technique is at a certain level. And then rehearsal is about the steps... about the nuance, about feeling. About how you breathe about what you're thinking, about where you're looking. About how you are feeling, The...the meaning of... your dance. And, communicating that to the audience. * (kiss sound) (laughter, giggling, applause) * * It's the magic of the theater, too. (Yes). How people move inside and they come to a place that is really a different time and place. * You see their faces during the production. How they are coming to life and they're laughing and smiling and how it's like, art lifts you up and how having this, like, space that you go into and you are entering another world. How it refreshes your... your spirit and your heart. * * (applause) Costumes can sometimes be a pain. I'm getting in little by little, so....alright. (ughh) Thing to now... It's fun to watch you struggle. Yeah... (gasp, choke, inhale) Oh, this is cool. It's cool. (laughs) It's like there's a bunny wabbit. Yeah, and his wingspan is like 18 feet. It's not 18 feet. For God's sake, it's probably not even 5 feet. That looks so weird. * * I took over the program book 5 years ago. That's the number one fundraising That will help the Nutcracker cause. (unintelligible background voices) 3, one more, ready 1, 2, 3... Great job. * Very nice. Let's get one... just put your hands like this. There ya go. Well you know so many of our tutus are from great ballerinas. Because Marat would always call and say, Do you have any tutus? Because we don't have anything . In the beginning. we had nothing. So when the Kirov would come, someone would always come with a little brown paper bag, you know, like drugs or something. Here... here's something for Marat. And we'd all go, "Wow, Mahale's tutu! and they all have their names written inside. And Joe is still altering our boy's costumes today. And we only have 6 days left. We just got them yesterday and they're too narrow for Adam and it's not really fixable. I just have to... Yeah, a one piece collar. The problem is, the costumes were made in Russia So they were never tried. Joe has been making a new pas de troix costume for Mikhael and he keeps bringing it back and refitting, bringing it back and refitting to make sure that it fits Mikhael and he can move. That wasn't done with Adam. Adam couldn't lift his arms. up... whatever I don't know what that position is... Third position. But we're so lucky to have Joe. He's a saint. I'll actually get started a... mock up right away. Yes, you can take it off now. Especially with the soloists. They'll put on their costume and then they go upstairs and make sure Marat likes it. And there's no such thing as "can't". Like... Da nyet? And you want to do things for him, you want to please him cuz he's such a doll. You know. And he's right... he's right. It's just that we have... don't have enough time. loading the truck tomorrow. It's just like, we're Quick changes and many of them we have to sew them in their costumes. So we'll be on stage sewing them, actually in the costume and then cutting them out of the costume so that they can quickly get in the next costume. (director) How do you know how to do this? I didn't. (laughs) From experience. I mean. I, I still don't know. (laughs) I don't. We just, sort of figure it out. I think it was Miss Yuko, our wardrobe mistress, who said, she said, I always dreamed of being part of something that is greater than myself. And I'm so honored to do this work." Parents are basically the engine that drives this performance. They're doing everything to both support their children and fund the production. Parents really have come to understand over the years that they're in it too. You know, it's their production, as well. When you give everything and the result is good, people want to join in and help, too. So, almost all of them have come to us and said oh, I can do this . You go out there, you know, and people are busy. You know, they're wrapping things, they're, you know... I'm in charge of hair and makeup. ... then we'll give you a lesson how to do it. We're just so fortunate. It's a family here. I mean we're very inclusive, you know, as long as you're part of the Nutcracker family, you're part of the whole family. And, uh, I also do the backstage crew. This is the props. Load in, load out. Grandfather's clocks, chairs, Christmas trees, presents that you see moving in and out of the stage. It's...it's quite beautiful. I mean, how could you say no to ballet? How could you say no to the production of Marat when you see and watch, You cannot say no to the children. * (director) You guys all look so different in regular clothes. We're rarely in regular clothes. (laughs) Can you imagine Adam as. like, a grandpa in that chair? (laughs) How often do you talk about us at the dinner table? No jokes. Like, seriously. What does your family say about me? (laughter) Especially your dad who is like who's this like, renown ballerin... a, ballerin... o? (laughter) It's called a ballerone. That's it, ballerone. No you don't really think like, that he's a world renown star. Like, I do sometimes, like, my dad did so many great things for the dance world. But outside of class I see him as my dad. But inside of class I see him as a teacher and I don't really think of him as my dad. It's like a big... (difference?) yeah, a big difference. Yeah, I think like, everywhere else people are like, expecting their teachers to be like, Oh my God, you were perfect . And in ballet, the biggest compliment that you can get is Good . Like seriously, it's like, the biggest compliment. Like if you hear, good, you're so happy. Especially from Marat. It's just because of the, like, lifestyle he's come from. Like, there was not "perfect" in Russian vocabulary. And like, and I... I mean... but I think that's just one of the reasons why he was so amazing and why the Kirov is so amazing because they just always strive for perfection. Like they strive to be better than perfect. Like, he was telling us the other day that they had grading books where they (oh yeah) where they gave them grades and, um no one in the studio, like, in the Kirov company, ever got an A. (gasp) C, C plus... C plus, was like a good grade. (unintelligible) And a "B" for them was like, excellent. But they would never get an "A". All ballerinas are perfectionists. Like, when you can't do something, it's just like, the worst feeling. I get like, so frustrated when I can't do something right. Or like, can't nail that triple turn or something. If you don't do it in rehearsal you can't do it on stage. You have to do at least 300% in every class to get at least like an 85% on stage. Cuz, you lose everything once you get on stage. If you're just marking it it in rehearsal, you're not going to get better and you're just going to embarrass yourself on stage. I respect that because if they want us to like, make it, which we want to do in like, the "real world", the real dance world, we need to be prepared to have like, one rehearsal and like, be ready to perform. Yeah, I think, I think everybody's favorite season is Nutcracker. I think it's a magical week. You're here 24/7. Literally, like my mom's like we should just buy you a bed there. People might complain you know ughhh, I'm at the studio from 12 til 8 today. But for me, like I don't want to sound like I don't have a social life but like, you know, after Nutcracker, it's really like, what do I do now? We're all doing the thing that we love. We're so much closer to these people than anywhere else. You're so much closer cuz you knew each other since you were like, 5. I came from France and I was the only boy. But once I came to Marat's, it was like, I'm not the only boy. Wait, I remember when... I build a relationship with the guys... and, and the girls. I've... held everyone's waist in this room. I've travelled with most of the people in this room. I've slept in the same bed with some of the people in this room. We've gone literally to so many different stages together. All of this because of ballet And that's what joins us all together. Like, I consider you guys as my like, brothers and sisters. I love you Edgar. (laughter) We are like family and brothers, sisters... daughters, husbands, wives. Well, Saya hasn't said anything the whole time. Well, number one, um, it's been my dream to be Masha. (cries) Oh, Saya, I feel you. last year, everyone told me that I was gonna get Masha. and I got my hopes up. (cries) And, and I didn't get it. And same with this year. Um, everyone told me that I was gonna get it this year for sure. And I didn't get it. Um, I'm really happy for the people that got it last year and this year. Um...but...um... like someone said, like, if you work hard for it you'll be put in the front row. And I've been working since I was in level 1 and it's been my dream to be Masha since level 1. But I never got it. Um... but, I'm pretty sure there's a reason for all this and I'm happy with the roles I got this year. Um, so... yeah. There's just so much, so much time. So much time. And we're, you know, we're throwing everything into it right now. But you'll get there and all of the sudden you'll have done Masha or Sugar Plum or Prince or whatever you did, so many times that you won't even want it at that point. So, you know, savor the, the hunting for it. The, the wanting that role Cuz it'll go away. I mean they do 48 Nutcrackers at City Ballet. 48 Nutcrackers in a season. It's just, it's ridiculous, you know. You end up doing that role that you dreamed for, since you were 7 years old, a hundred times in a row. But basically it doesn't even matter. Whether you're a principal, whether you're corps de ballet. I mean in the end, it's all dance. It's all ballet. That's what we're here for, I mean, that's what we do. There's no dividing lines of reality. We make them and we have these judgements in our mind. But actually... just one thing. We're all just here to dance. So... so cherish it. (giggling, laughter unintelligible voices) (director) What's your hope in doing this documentary? * * (whining sound,truck liftge) Jeffrey came to us and said Well, I have a catering company and I have, you know, several restaurants. And so I would like to do your catering next year." I have a tent company come out and build me a fairly large tent. And we put carpeting in it and we try to make it a little bit nicer. So basically all the performers can sit down at one time and eat. Before we used to have a list and we used to check off who paid and who didn't pay and Jeffrey said No. . For the parents who had not not paid, to see them say "I'm sorry, you don't have a ticket or a... a band" Or whatever you know, "You need to have you can't eat. ....really hard. But I wanted to treat them like performers. so everybody breaks bread together, the same food goes to everyone. I don't know who pays and who doesn't. Doesn't really matter to me. Because, you know, how many moments are we all in the same place... together? Nothing better. I mean, what else... what else is there? Like our hot chocolates. This is the best part about the Nutcracker. Especially when you You put in perfect water and everything. It's good. Glad you're enjoying it. I love. It's really come together long before we're in the theater. I mean, we have run through always the weekend of Thanksgiving. And by then we're running the whole performance from the top. And everything is running very smoothly. People who are working with props have all the props going at the same time. Costumes are all ready. I mean we're almost ready to do dress in... on the weekend of Thnksgiving. So it's really just, you know, the fine points after that. * (unintelligible background voices) Where are we going? This way. Where are we going? (unintelligible voices... laughter) Inside the theater everything is bright and beautiful, lights, and costumes, performance. You are, you are in a magical world. and in a very happy world. And then you go outside and everything is like dreary and dull...it's reality. (background voices) Quiet! Good discipline on the stage, please. On the stage, don't talk. Thank you, thank you everyone. We're so happy This is the culmination of many weeks of work. You need to know exactly where your marks are Where you need to be on the stage.... shhhhh. And use these performance times to really perform And not just mark it and run through because because if you wait until performance to perform, You won't really be ready. * Each individual who dances a role brings something completely different and unique to it. So it's not that you're doing the same old ballet. you have a different energy, you have a different feeling. Each person is unique and each performance is unique. When you have a group, you must follow each other. You have to follow the lines otherwise all your work, all our work is nothing. Look at each other. Look across. The diagonals. Here's blue and blue and blue and blue. The red one is the center line. Hasmik. (unintelligible) It's beginning waltz girls, girls make only like this. Little bit, yes... next. Ladies, men, only head. No, no, no, only head. Like this. Don't forget you placement. Alright... Don't forget. Oh my gosh! Think this is a fire hazzard? I... uh... absolutely. (laughter) One on top of another, after another... We are at the computer. We are about to start our first rehearsal. Face to face, like this. Closer, closer. Curtain coming! Curtain coming! You face this way. You in center... Cami... guys, listen me. This is center, right? Close face for her because is princess. This way. QUIET! Alright, music. Start now. (PA) Music please start. * (PA) Yes, Tasha smile. (PA keeping beat) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. (PA) Face this way, Fiona. Keep going, keep going... * Be careful, be careful. Check your spaces, girls. * (PA, unintelligible) Girls I have to move you up a little bit. Right, this one. Ysa... Because they need to cross in front right there. You will be right here. On this tape, like this wing, you see this? There's like too much of something in... (Laughs) (PA) Movement of props. Don't be in anbody's way, mice. Go forward, go forward, go forward. * (PA) Stay altogether... is better. (PA) Go plié! * Guys... Another boy, he's on entrance so he pushes everybody back (director) So you understand? Yeah, and I'm not an entrance. Today I was just looking forward to being an entrance. And my dad too was looking forward to seeing me cuz I was so cute. But today he can't see me. (director) You still look cute. (sighs) Cast 2, the coda? Yeah. Luis and Alex were gonna do it but Alex had a blister though (director) I know, it's huge. So yeah, so they... Hasmik just told me on the side, Just do it. I know, I put my costume downstairs. So I ran out and got sewn in to my costume. * (PA) No, to your right, Ava Yes. * (PA) Ava you look like you're chewing something. Smile. (PA) Ava, turn your back leg out. Here. Hands to hands, hold. See, you have big space here, Move! move. Stay here. Move back. Show them this is how you stay. Stop. Like this. Please... uh, music. * Go, go, go, up. Hands to hands, hands to hands, hands to hands. Everybody forward, forward. Boys move back. Boys move back, boys move back. BOYS MOVE BACK! You're not boys! Boys move back. Stay girls. STAY, STAY, STAY, STAY, please! Stay, stay... step, 1, 2, 3, 4 One more time. Go back. The curtain is coming in, everybody out of the way. But I really need more rehearsal. Cuz we had a really bad rehearsal yesterday. (director) That's good, it's good luck. I heard it was good luck. So usually for breakfast I eat apples with peanut butter. Also either like bagels or bread or brioche. So uI usually just eat like at applsunny side up eggs. r. And then toast. I drink... tea. But like, the nerves are just like, getting to me. Like I really don't wanna... it's just... scary. (director) Right before performance, do you have to run to the bathroom? Well, in New York actually this year, I was, I had to go pee really badly but I couldn't because I was sewn in. Cuz competitions we're sewn in and then obviously like, when you're nervous you have to go pee. So like, 'Til you're on stage and you don't have to pee anymore. It's... horrible. It's bad. There were a couple of extra little hops. Yeah. I woke up at 10. (director) And you got up when? Like just now, 10 minutes ago. I just rolled him out of bed. (laughs, coughs) You're dying, man. (laughs) Oh, man, I have more than just one mosquito bite. (laughing) Ha, ha You're counting them? By the way, is this normal? (gasp) Holy shhhhh. I wasn't kidding when I said I.. (director) Those are spider bites, Adam. Yeah. Oh my gosh, what do we do? Dude! You are something else, man. (director) You need an anti-inflamatory. Oh...God. Let's go do my stuff before we leave. (director) Okay, alright. Today I might be a little more nervous cuz of my back. But I felt okay, you know, I felt bad up until I got onstage for tarantella and then I could move again. And then I got off stage and I felt bad again. So, I assume adrenaline will help. I love ballet while I do it and I love it so much you know, but it doesn't really hold the intellectual nutrients yeah, the nutrients That I need to feel, you know, full. I want to end up doing contemporary by the end of it all. Where I don't have to break my body anymore but I can still dance. (director) Did you ever think you'd be putting makeup on your son Denise? No, never. I never...wanted this. We had to make him do it the first few times. I don't like it at all. It's so tedius and... Hasmik does it for me when she's with me and she does a really good job but it's like, she does it like, Armenian style, like "Open it! Open it!" Eli says, "Hi". (laughs) Eli. (director) You're done with your makeup? Yeah. (director) You sound nervous. I mean like, I think I know I can do it. It's just the heel. I'm really scared for that. And also, I always get nervous. It's a home made medicine. It's crushed Tylenol. Like, pain reliever so it doesn't hurt right now. She's just, you know, a little bit concerned. Cuz everyone was saying they're under rehearsed. This is, this is my concern, oh my gosh. Like I think I'm gonna cry cuz I'm so nervous. (laughs) * * Beef or chicken? Oh my God, you didn't even make it to dinner last night I know. did you? (unintelligible voices) I'm not dressed! Why are you making it small? Guys we have very little time right now. and I have to get through a lot. We're not gonna do the red dots. We're only doing the dress, the bow, the hair. There's only about 3 girls looking up here. So I really have to make sure you guys can hear this. * (background voices) 7 o'clock! 7 o'clock! 7 o'clock! Don't move. (kiss sound) * (unintelligible voices) Can I borrow it? * * More than you could ever know * * Make my wish come true * * Baby all I want for Christmas * * is you * Choco with your nose so bright * * wont you guide the girls tonight * (laughter) This is my personal hairdresser. Real men know how to do their own makeup. How to do their own make up? Yes. (laughter) Am I good? Yeah. (giggling) See mine's on the right lane the right lane... right stage. It's just the backstage you know, cuz from the front it's so organized. Number after number. From the side it's chaos. So, at least to me it looks like chaos. Cheers. Have a toast? Yeah. Woooo. One more time. Like, look like this. Ughhhhh. Bite, right. No... yes! That's... that's it! Act like you're chewing beets. Look, bread. Ahhhhh. Not like this. (laughter) Here. Here.

Keep acting like a doll Right into the wings... * * (clock chimes 6 times) (clock chimes 6 times) * * (Children's voices, lower music) (Children's voices, lower music) * * (applause) * (lower music) * (music gradually louder) (music gradually louder) * (applause) There was someone not in it and then they put an extra person in so in the last line there was one extra person. So I didn't have a space. It was just crazy. Ughhh, That did not go well. Everyone was out there except us and then we ran out really late. We got shoved out and then we had no choice. I'd rather not even go out there. First act was fantastic boys. (dramatic sigh) (background voices) Oh wait, I got it, I got it. Oh my God. Go...1, 2, 3. It means a lot for him to come here and watch me dance. * * (applause) * * Shhhhhhh... * (clapping in time with music) (applause, shouts) * * (applause, shouts) * * (applause, shouts) It's the best dance.
