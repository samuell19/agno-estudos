He's just a little kid, okay? Look, we can work this out. Hey, why should I believe you, huh? You've been nothing but trouble to me. Look, look, look. I know what he did was wrong. I'll get your radio back, okay? Promise. Look, I don't want your little brother to get sent away, okay? You get me my radio back and be friendly towards me, I'll forget about this whole thing. We got a deal? Yeah, we got a deal. $75. Thank you, and it's a pleasure doing business with you. I like you, son. Well, gotta run. Later. Any time. Any time. Yo, man, what'd he give you? $75, man.

Listen, my brother's looking for me, he's gonna kill me. I'll give you $25, you could buy 50 pizzas. The Wild Thing gonna be here soon, man. Then protect me. All right, be my guest. Shorty! Ah, hell. You scared the shit out of me. How long you been in town? Shorty, this is not a social call. Oh, it's a business call. Okay. Maybe you want to come back to work for me. I'd be glad to have you. You were the best. Shorty, I need that radio back. Ah, you're here to redeem little brother. Okay, you can have the radio back. Sure. I'll give you a special bargain. $250, and it's yours. Shorty, you just bought the radio for $75, man. Look, every good relationship has give and take. So give me the radio and I'll take it. Slow down, bro. I ain't in this business to sell for no profit. $250, and the radio's yours, or go lift your own. Shorty, I need the radio back, okay? Or what? You'll go to the police? Don't make me laugh. You know something, man? You're still the slime of crime, you know that? I'll take that as a compliment. You hold on to the radio, I'll be back with the money, okay? You got the $250, you got the radio. Hey, Dixie! Dixie, you on lunch? I thought I told you to leave me alone. Yeah, but I want to talk to you about something. And I've got things to do.

You been going out with Hood again? Huh? What do you mean, again? Oh, you know what I mean. Look, I don't know what's going on in that empty space in between your ears, but I've never been with Hood, and you know it. But you're jealous, aren't you? Of who he is. Well, I don't blame you. 'Cause as I see it, he's got more going than you ever will. You ungrateful bitch. You know something? You're not gonna go anywhere, wearing my chain. Yo, Allan, it's getting late, you better get your little ass home. I ain't going nowhere. Why not? I told you before, big brother'll hit me. Yeah, what did you do this time?

I just think that if you have something to say, something good to say, and you do, that you should say it so everyone can hear it. I mean, say it on the radios or on the records, or on television, whatever. But just say it so that everyone could hear it. Ha, ha! Hey, you wanna see your shop burn? [man] No! [gang cheering] [man] Ugh! Mind your manners. Yeah... Boys, right this way. [man laughing] [men] Woo! [man] Any time. Any time. Gentlemen, you did a great job today. You know what I mean? You did a great job, great job. [men] Woo! Just the man I'm looking for. Cedric. [man] Hey, money man. [man 2] Oh, money, money! [Duane] Yeah. Time to get paid. The man I'm looking for. All right. How you doing? Pretty good. How'd it go? Oh, it went great. It went great. It went great. We took care of everything, took care of business, right? Just like our end of the deal. Now I think it's time that you deliver the goods, right? You know, y-you didn't seriously hurt anybody, just gave 'em a big scare, right? Fellas, did we hurt anybody? [all] No. No. [Duane] See, we didn't hurt anybody. Let me see, now. Now, what did we agree upon before? Well, let me help you out with that. $175 during the week and $210 on weekends. [all laughing] -Right, right. -Yeah, yeah. Here. Here's $1,200. You deserve it. $1,200. That's great. -But it's not enough. -Huh? I said, "it's not enough." But that's what we agreed upon. I don't care. Me and my boys worked real hard, worked a lot of overtime, you know? We scared the shit out of a lot of people. [all laughing] Right? I want more, you know what I'm saying? I want more. That's all we... That's... That's all that was allotted in this operation. What're you trying to tell me? You don't have any more money? Yeah? Fellows, we've been in that position, right? I know where you're coming from. Times are tough. Reagan's president, right? You got more money. I know you got some money in there. Please! W-w-wait a second. Whoa! Whoa! [all laughing] Woo! What's this? Cedric's savings and loan? I was just s-saving that for a r-rainy d-day. Saving it for a rainy day? Well, I'll be. I got this feeling, you know, it's, uh, it's gonna rain today, man. [coughing] You got more money, don't you? You know something, you're in luck, fella. The circus is in town. I think you better get yourself a ticket and get outta here. [engine starts] [Duane] All right. Looks like we got the Lee family. Oh, yeah? What's the Lee family? Oh, let me explain it to you, okay? We got a Home-Lee, we got Ug-Lee and there's Dumb-Lee, little old Sick-Lee, and we got Fug-Lee. [men laughing] Look, Duane, you've had your fun. Now, why don't you take these girl scouts home? By the way, did you tell your mother not to set your place at the dinner table? 'cause you won't be home for dinner. Man, kick his ass, I ain't got time for this. [man] Come on. Come on, let's move it. [man 2] Kick his ass, man. [man 3] Do it, Ice. Ah! [man] All right! [men cheering] Keeya! [men shouting] [grunting] [Ice] Lights out, sucker. [men grunting] Damn!

Don't do it-- I wasn't gonna do it, grandma. Oh, don't do it, baby. I wasn't gonna do it. [Grandma] Oh, thank you, Jesus. I wasn't gonna do it. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, baby. Thank you. [man] Yo!

Order! Order. [chattering stops] Ladies and gentlemen, after looking over the papers, submitted to me by Mr. Thorndike, if you have no objections, I hereby grant Thorndike associates construction rights on all properties from Columbus Avenue to the river. Excuse me. I object. Yes, sir. What do you have to say? Uh, sir, the man is a hoodlum, just released from jail on assault charges. Nonetheless, you'll let the man speak his piece. Please, gentlemen, order. I did a crime, and then I did my time. But he uses illegal means and still keeps his record clean. Sir, do we have to listen to this clown? I mean, what kind of gibberish is this? This is rap. What? It's what we feel and the way we say it when it's real. [Thorndike] Nonsense. Sir, everything we have done is legal. Now, these people object, they'll want to press charges, they can go ahead. But there is a development plan approved by the board, you can check it. It's all legal.
