[C.B. chatter] [beeping] [scoffs] Welcome back, boys. [man] As somebody once said, there's a difference between a failure and a fiasco.

[man 2] What the hell is he doing here? [man 1] But a fiasco... A fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions. A fiasco is a folk tale told to others that makes other people feel more... alive... because it didn't happen to them. I'm fine. I... I... I'm fine. I'll take you to Phil so you don't get lost. [man] Mercury Worldwide Shoes, which is actually Phil, contains some of America's finest artist's masterworks seen only by people heading for very important meetings. A promotion, or otherwise. We are not just employees, as Phil once said. We are denizens of greatness. Phil says the world is full of those who achieve through negativity or theft. We succeed through original thought. A shoe is not just a shoe. It connects us to the earth. The right shoe can transport us, make us believe we are capable of more. But there are sacrifices for a goal like pure greatness, like birthdays, or last Christmas with my family. [all] ...and make bounties through our Lord, amen. Dig in, and no making fun of my cooking. Ha ha. This must be homemade. Oh, Dad! [man] Though we sometimes celebrate odd things at Mercury, like the day the Italians invented rubber... Which they didn't, of course... But that's beside the point. [woman] where exactly is Drew, anyway? [yelling and cheering] We've contained magic... in a shoe! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! [all] Drew! Drew! Drew! Drew! Drew! [Drew] It was meant to approximate walking on a cloud. Hey, if you ever need anything around here, I'm your girl. [Drew] Any true student of functional shoe design is also a student of Phil himself. He is a master, and Phil's innate wisdom of what people want and need has never failed to date. I'm fine. [Drew] He's also obsessed with the number 2. Hi, how are you doing? 7:30 or 8:00... [Drew] These are Phil's prized 2 Norman Rockwell's. The pair of paintings that once hung outside the White House office of John F. Kennedy. And yes, the 2 treasured doors Phil once purchased from a church on vacation in Tunisia and had sent back home for a total cost too enormous to mention. $762,000. Each. Just 2 more minutes and I can send you in, hmm? [Drew] Because we have a moment here, let me tell you that I have recently become a secret connoisseur of last looks. You know the way people look at you when they believe it's for the last time? I've started collecting these looks, and... OK, he's ready for you. [Drew] There's one right now. How are you, Drew? I wanted to jump out of the window of that helicopter and just splatter on the trees, to tell you the truth. Don't do that. It's only money. The American psyche is in turmoil, Drew, and we have miscalculated. I'm sorry. I have no rule book for this situation. They tell me that we are about to lose 972... million dollars. I am... ill-equipped in the philosophies of failure. Walk with me, Drew. My basketball team. They don't even know yet. My global environmental watchdog project will have to go. Sweet people. We could have saved the planet, but... how do I make the concept of $972 million more real to you? It's the operating budget of a mid-sized country, a small civilization. It's big. It's so big, you could round it off to a billion dollars. I cry a lot lately. The promise of a global future, pinned to a groundbreaking shoe, your design, with a new form of material launched this week to great fanfare, and now meeting a growing international roar of laughter... and rejection. Enough to cause this memo... from Jeffrey Barlow, CEO Of D.C.S.: "This once highly anticipated product may actually cause an entire generation to return to bare feet." [laughing hysterically] Wow. We are about to enter... a free-fall plunge. And the sound you hear is the sound of shit hitting the fan. Globally. [whispering] You hear it? Swoosh! I wish there was something I could do. Actually, there is. In a room downstairs is a reporter from Global Business Today. We need to make him understand we hired you from our national scholarship program. We supported... invested in... Your brilliance. This was a very creative endeavor, and I think you should stand up... for your incredible work. You OK? I'm fi... It's a little bit like knowing the plane's going down before anyone else, isn't it? When does this run? A week? A week. Come Sunday evening, it'll be on the stands. Any last words? [Drew] And in that moment, I knew. I know we hired you at the last minute, but I just... [Drew] Success. Success, not greatness, was the only god the entire world served.

Drew, it's your sister. I have some really bad news. Could you call me tomorrow? No. Could you call me a little later? No, honey! Dad died. He had a heart attack back in Kentucky. He was still visiting Uncle Dale. Mom is in total shock. You have to handle this. You're the oldest! You're the responsible one. I don't know why he went to Kentucky. I don't know what the attraction was. He was born there. They never liked me there. They never have. Drew will take care of everything. Honey, you understand I can't go because of the baby? I'll be back in 2 days. I'll man the phones. I'll always be the one that snatched him away from them. The 2 sides of this family have never integrated well, so don't expect to make a lot of friends when you go there. Drew doesn't make friends, Mom. I have friends! Do you have the blue suit? I have the blue suit. Oh, he loved that silly blue suit. God only knows if I made him truly happy. I'll call from Kentucky, I'll be there in the morning. We have a plan! We have a plan, and you hold your head up high, because don't you forget, you go back there as the most successful man in the history of this family. Don't let them try anything. Oh, my God! I have to call people. I have to clean out the office. I'm a widow! We'll figure this out. We'll figure this out. Just get Dad home. Hurry. I was still waiting for everything to start. Now it's... over? I'll bring him home. Wait, wait! Stay close. Come, come, come. Now, what was it that Dad always said? If it wasn't this... [Drew and Hollie] It would be something else. Now, you go. You go and you make him proud, and you call and tell me what's going on, OK? All right. [Drew] I would go to Kentucky, put my father in the blue suit, bring him home, and then get back on that bike.

I know it's all very charming with the pickled things in jars and the Southern charm and the hams that hang in the garage until they're so covered with mold you could grow penicillin on them, but I'm telling... Are you sure about the cremation? If Bill Banyon is there, definitely cremation! And you... you tell Bill Banyon I'll be there. [cell phone ringing "I Can't Get Next to You"] Hello? Aloha. I talked to my friend Kendra who, uh, had a girlfriend with a kid who's exceedingly loud like Samson, and she's given me a video tape that works absolute miracles. Hey, thanks, Claire. What? You're already tired of me? I just haven't slept. I'm sorry. How's Hawaii? Well... I'm checking out this cute guy. Why are you telling me that? [bang] How could I leave you in distress? I'm taking you out. I thought you were in... What's this? Hawaii. "When cremation is your preference"... [man] I just got some brochures I want y'all to look at. And these are some choices of urns available here at the Cave Hill Cemetery. You can take them home with you.

You do know that. Sort of amazing, even. Oh, come on! I don't need an ice cream cone. It's not an ice cream cone. What's an ice cream cone? You know, here's a little something to make you happy. Something sweet that melts in 5 minutes. I'm completely cool with anything you want to say or not say. I don't need it. Besides, Ben is coming in tomorrow. Do you want to hear my theory? Of course. You and I have a special talent, and I saw it immediately. Tell me. We're the substitute people. Substitute people? I've been the substitute person my whole life. I'm not an Ellen... I never wanted to be an Ellen. And I'm not a Cindy, either. Although Chucks love me. I'm sure they do. I like being alone too much. I mean, I'm with a guy who's married to his academic career. I rarely see him. And I'm the substitute person there. I like it that way. It's a lot less pressure. Here. Play this for the loudest kid in the world. I'm not used to girls like you. That's because I'm one-of-a-kind. You don't have to make a joke. I like you without the jokes. Get some sleep. I have a personnel interview tomorrow morning, and if I get transferred... Ben will die. [sighing] [sighs] [plastic thumping] Didn't it just feel better that we just didn't do something impulsive? I mean... Yes. Hey. Now we actually have a shot at being friends for the rest of our lives. The rest of our lives. Hmm. [children yelling] OK, now for the celebration proper, we got the military bands, the right mix of 7 speakers, no crybabies. It's official. Paul, Doug, and Rick are flying in from Florida. Ruckus will reunite for this one evening. Ahem. How we doing on balloons? I sent to Balloon City. I got a bunch of them. And Drew, my casket did come in from Lexington. And I got to tell you it's quite beautiful. Look, Drew, I am getting the question constantly, OK? Why isn't he buried in Elizabethtown? It's not an insult to anybody here. Well, is there such a thing as partial cremation? Aah! Bill Banyon, how can you even say such a thing? I know you all love my dad. You can't dismiss my mother's wishes. And we're not from California. Jesse, can you do something about your son? Yeah. All right. A couple good ass-kickings might be in line. I think what Charles Dean wants to say... I know what he's saying. You all have different versions of him that you love a lot. This is ours. My family's record of the last thing he said on the subject. That's the plan. That is the way it's going to be, guys. Sprinkled at sea! [yelling] And that's the decision from California! Shit. Oregon. We really are from Oregon. Randy, don't make me come spank you. Leave him alone! Jesse, I have something for you. [yelling] We're going to watch this. One second. Hi. My name's Rusty. I helped build this house a long time ago. But wood-eating insects, called termites, have compromised the integrity of this once-fine structure. What's that sound? So, today... I'm going to blow it up. Silence. Now, if I blow this house up, will you promise to behave and mind your mommy and daddy? [all] Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Good. Let's blow it up. [Rusty] Joe, we ready to go? [man on radio] Yeah, Rusty. Light it up. 3... 2... 1. Whoo! Now let's build a new house. Thank you... for taking an interest in Jesse. Feels good, doesn't it? It's like Mitch is here. I can see Mitch right now. So proud... in that blue suit. Can't you? Stop the cremation! Stop the cremation! Stop the cremation! What the hell's going on, man? Hold on, wait right here. I'm sorry. Here's your dad, man. It takes a year and a half to plan a wedding properly. It does. Are you serious? Yes. This is Claire. I feel like I've known her my whole life. [girls chattering] Is that... Hey, Mitch. So what happened to Ben? Ahh. There was a storm in Georgia. They grounded all the planes. And he doesn't like to fly. And... And now they want him to speak at some trustees' event. Trot out some big ideas. Claire, I want to see you on the tour of Maker's Mark tomorrow at 10 A.M., sharp. All right. All right? I love this girl! I love this girl! Whoo! You look great. Oh, I'm a mess. You're crazy, Claire. You look amazing. Thank you. And this dress... Did well on the personnel interview, though. Right. The interview. I forgot. I know. I'm impossible to forget, but I'm hard to remember. Drew! Loving life. Loving you. [upbeat music plays] Hey, missed you at the rehearsal dinner. [all chanting "Chuck"] Claire? Yeah? Let's show Mitch the site of his memorial.OK. [all chanting "Chuck"] "Chuck and Cindy, the wedding." [chuckles] There you go, Dad. Welcome to the annual meeting of people who... annually meet. [Drew claps] And we'll see y'all again next year. Very nice. Come on. I'm just going to say right now what we're not saying and let the chips fall. Let the chips fall. Let the chips fall where they may. Yes, yes. I may be embarrassing myself, but I'm just going to say it. I like you! What? I think you should eat something. [laughs] I have been starving myself all week long... For Ben. And I'm gonna eat. We'll eat in my room. Oh, room service? Ooh. I want cheese and cheese-related things... No, eggs and fries, with cheese on everything. Cheese it is. Cheese and Coca-Cola. [chuckles] And don't worry, because as great as you look tonight, you are safe with me. 'Course it's safe. It's a full moon. I look good. You do look good. I'm wearing these clothes, I mean... Have you ever had unlucky clothes? This dress that you like? Good things have not happened to me in this dress. But I saw it tonight, and I said, "I'm gonna give you one more chance." And I refuse to be let down by this dress again. [laughs] Oh, anyway, forget all that. You're here, and we're together, and it's a get-out-of-jail-free card. It's almost midnight. Life cannot be so cruel that we don't deserve to be together... to eat. [sighs] Hi, Chuck. Hey, Cindy. [giggles] Wait. Where's Mitch? I left him in the ballroom. I'm sorry Ben missed the flight. He forgot? No storm in Georgia. No... trustees. No big ideas. What a fuckin' jerk. He's not a jerk. He's a brilliant man who gives himself permission to be preoccupied. Come on. You know, there is nothing greater than deciding in your life that things maybe really are black and white. And this guy, Ben, who clearly takes you for granted, who serially takes advantage of you, is bad. And what I am saying is good. See what I mean? You shouldn't be the substitute for anybody. This guy should be right here, right now, doing this. Maybe so. He's lucky I'm not the right person for you. I know why it's not you, but just tell me so... I can see it from your perspective. See, I know what you deserve. What do I deserve? You deserve... You deserve... You deserve... a guy who says... "I can't imagine a world without you." We will start a winery when we are 70. We will snowboard every December, "and one year, take our kids." Hmm. "And we will always have the twin red Lexuses with the license plates reading 'Chuck' and 'Cindy.'" You deserve all this. And more. It's not you, I know. Please don't take this as rejection. [whispers] I really don't. [glasses rattle] [Claire giggles] [Drew] Ben's very lucky. All we did was kiss. [Claire] Most of the sex I've had in my life... was not as personal as that kiss. [music playing on television] [grunting] I'm putting on my shoes now. [stomps] Oops! Excuse me. [whispering] Sorry. [crash]Hmm? I'm walking out the door... in last night's clothes. Hey, Claire! Don't leave! Stay! Let's have breakfast! [grunts] I will miss your lips and everything attached to them. See ya, Mitch. [girls shouting] I love that dress! Claire, you slut! Claire, swear to God! Claire! Yeah, Claire! Hey! Hey! Wait up! Just tell me you love me and get it over with. Claire, I'm just gonna say this, because you deserve it. It's not easy for me, but... here goes. 4 days ago... I lost... a major American shoe company... frankly, you could round it off to 1 billion dollars. And by tomorrow afternoon, everyone will know. Something's going to be published that pinpoints me as the most spectacular failure in the history of my profession, which is all I know how to do. And I've been here this whole time tryin' to be responsible and charming, and live up to this success that doesn't exist. All I really want... is to not... be here. I'm sorry. I have a very dark appointment with destiny. That's my secret. That's who I am. That's it? Yes, that's it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, I guess I just thought a small part of you might be a small bit sad to see me go, but I guess this is all mostly about a shoe? Of course I'm sad about you, but this is just a little bit bigger than you and me, and by the way, I didn't say million, I said billion! [chuckles] A billion dollars. That's a lot of million. So you failed. No, you don't get it. All right. You really failed. You failed, you failed, you failed. You failed. You failed. You failed, you failed, you failed. You failed, you failed, you failed, you failed, you... You think I care about that? I do understand. You're an artist, man. Your job is to break through barriers, not accept blame, and bow, and say, "Thank you. I'm a loser. I'll go away now." "Oh, Phil's mean to me." Whaa, whaa, whaa. So what? I don't cry. You want to be really great? Then have the courage to fail big and stick around. Make 'em wonder why you're still smilin'. That's true greatness to me. But... don't listen to me. I'm a Claire. Well, thank you, Claire. You're welcome. Now would you quit tryin' to break up with me? You are always tryin' to break up with me, and we're not even together. I know. Wait. We're not? Of course not. We're the substitute people, remember? I'll see you at Mitch's memorial, if I can make it. [dull music playing] All right, when I give you the signal, pull the pulley slowly across. All right, slow and soulful. Will do. Slow and soulful. [crowd] Hollie. [Dale] Hollie. [Hollie] It's really good to see you. You look more beautiful than ever. Thank you. Sit down. Thanks. Mitch wrote letters. Never once sent an e-mail. He was always there for me. Where are you, Mitch? And I loved him. And y'all know that. [sobs] I loved him. Even though he moved to California... [sighs] God love him, he always came back to his roots. And I will miss his laugh. I don't have anything funny to say. And I don't have a funny story to tell. I will tell you it wasn't easy for Mitch to leave the military and start over again in California. [crowd murmuring] And I apologize, per se, for my role in that deal, per se. And to all of you who put this evening together, it has gone beautifully. And thank you. [whispers] Lena, it hasn't hit him yet. [whispers] Oh, it will. It will. Ladies and gentlemen, Hollie Baylor. [crowd murmuring] I want you to stay awake for this, all right? [sighs] I'm a little nervous. But here we are. It's been a while. Ohh. There was the shorthand of a long marriage. We were complete opposites, and it worked. Um, the plan was to send... my son to represent the family. I was terrified that you would look at me and see that woman from California who... took him away. Even though we only lived in California as a family for 18 months 27 years ago. Heh! I always... felt it. All because... I was standing in an elevator in Tokyo, and this handsome captain walked in, and... On his way home to Elizabethtown... And he was engaged, and so was I, and, um... somehow I hijacked him and took him to Disneyland. But something happened between us that was not part of the plan. We were in love. [microphone feedback] Let me tell you a little bit about life without Mitch. I, uh, wanted to get to know about Mitch's car, and it actually ate me. I went to the bank, and the teller looked at me strangely, and I got home, and I looked at myself in the mirror, and my face was still green from a facial mask that I had forgotten to take off. And I called our insurance man of 30 years, whose son Mitch had actually helped to get into West Point, to tell him that Mitch was gone. He didn't call me back for 2 days. Uh-huh. The car, the bank, the, um, insurance man, the world... I mean, nobody truly cared. Not like us. I always wanted to learn to tap dance, so I took tap dance lessons, and I wanted to learn... yep, I did. And I wanted to learn to cook organically, and so I attempted that. And, uh... I, uh... I fixed the toilet. [laughter] Yep, all by myself. [applause] And... I wanted to learn to laugh. Why couldn't I be funnier when Mitch was alive? But, you know, I figured it out. It takes time to be funny, and it takes time to extract joy from life. So I enrolled in comedy school. [laughter] It's... Yeah, I did. And... I know, I know. I was the oldest one in the class, thank you. And, uh, we were told to, um, tell a story, something true, something that really happened to us. So I got up there, and I talked about my husband and the love he left behind. A few days after Mitch died, I was walking through the yard, and I saw our neighbor, who was a very good friend of Mitch's, Bob. And he saw me coming through the gate, and, um... he said, "I am so sorry... for your loss." And I knew that he needed to feel that loss, too, and to share it, and I wanted to help him, and he-he put his arms around me. He cradled me. And his embrace tightened. Finally, here was somebody who truly cared. And then... I felt something... else. [embarrassed laughter] Something... huge. [laughter] Let's just say it. Let's just say it. A boner! [hysterical laughter] A boner! That's... That's what I get... That's what I get for tryin' to do everything myself. Boner Bob, my neighbor. Oh, dear. He rooted for all of you. I love you. This is for you. Your favorite song. On a Saturday night. ["Moon River" playing] Well, you really brought everybody together. I'll give you that. [footsteps] I have this thing for you. It's a very unique map. It's for your road trip home. Right. A map. You promised, remember? No. No, I do. I remember. [band playing "Freebird"] This is for you, Mitch. ♪ If I leave here Tomorrow... ♪ "Freebird," huh? Well, I better get back to... Ben. He finally made it. Does Ben even exist? [chuckles] Just...

Friends and neighbors, we are gathered here to say our final good-byes to... a dear friend... Mitch. Ow. [metal screeches] [all gasp] [creaking] [all gasp] [creaking] [crash] Come on, General.
