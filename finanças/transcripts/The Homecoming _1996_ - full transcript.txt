WE'D LIKE TO SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL. ANYBODY THAT'S GOT THE GUTS. JORDY! THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR. 3:00. MONDAY. SAME FIELD WHERE IT HAPPENED. ANYBODY THAT'S GOT THE GUTS. YOU TELL THEM I'LL BE THERE. [BANG!] (reading) "DEAR JORDY, DON'T BECOME SO WELL ADJUSTED TO YOUR CULTURE THAT YOU FIT INTO IT WITHOUT EVEN THINKING. FIX YOUR ATTENTION ON GOD. YOU'LL BE CHANGED FROM THE INSIDE OUT. WE GOT TO FIGHT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT BROTHER, WALLY." (Dr. Billy Graham) THERE'S SO MUCH DISEASE AND POVERTY AND WAR AND HATE AND LONELINESS, UNEMPLOYMENT, BOREDOM, SOCIAL INJUSTICE, RACIAL PROBLEMS, PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, AIDS. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE PUSHING IN ON US. AT A TIME, IT SEEMS TO ME, WHEN WE OUGHT TO HAVE A MARVELOUS WORLD OF PEACE AND LOVE. WHAT'S WRONG? AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ASKING THAT QUESTION: WHY? WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF US? WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD? IS THERE AN ANSWER TO IT ALL? DOES ANYBODY CARE? DOES ANYBODY REALLY LOVE YOU? YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO GOD. JUST AS THOUGH YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON THAT EVER LIVED. AND GOD LOVES YOU. AND HE WANTS TO FORGIVE YOU OF YOUR FAILURES AND YOUR SINS, ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TIME THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER. HE'S WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU TONIGHT. AND COVER IT UP AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED. GOD DOESN'T JUST SAY, "I LOVE YA, I FORGIVE YA." HE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HE SENT HIS SON, CHRIST, TO DIE ON THE CROSS. AND WHEN CHRIST DIED ON THAT CROSS, HE TOOK YOUR SINS AND MY SINS ON HIMSELF. AND HE TOOK MY SINS AND YOUR SINS AND BURIED THEM IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA. AND HE FORGETS THEM. WELL, YOU SAY, "BILLY, I KNOW THAT JESUS DID ALL THAT FOR US BECAUSE HE LOVED US. I KNOW THAT. BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO?" FIRST - YOU HAVE TO REPENT OF YOUR SINS. JESUS SAID, "I CAME NOT TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT SINNERS, TO REPENTANCE." SOME LITTLE BOY SAID, "REPENTANCE MEANS BEING SORRY ENOUGH TO QUIT." THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEFINITION. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS FAITH. WITHOUT FAITH, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE GOD. YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?" IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WORK UP. IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU DO WITH YOUR HEAD. IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DO WITH YOUR BODY. WITH YOUR HEART. WITH YOUR EMOTIONS. WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE, YOU SAY, "I GIVE MYSELF TO CHRIST." THE THIRD THING-- YOU MUST OBEY HIM. YOU MUST LIVE FOR HIM. AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TONIGHT TO RECEIVE CHRIST INTO YOUR HEART. AND LIVE FOR HIM THE BEST YOU CAN WITH HIS HELP. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAND TO YOUR FEET. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO RECEIVE CHRIST INTO YOUR HEART. TONIGHT IS A GOOD STARTING PLACE WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE AND MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PRAYING. YOU CAN GET STARTED AND SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO START, MAYBE AFRESH OR ANEW WITH YOU. I'VE BEEN SORT OF A FAILURE UP 'TIL NOW. I BELIEVE, BUT I HAVEN'T BELIEVED. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TONIGHT, IS TO GET STARTED." YOU SAY, "BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PRAY." YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRAY LIKE A PREACHER. YOU JUST TALK TO GOD AS THOUGH HE WERE YOUR BEST FRIEND WHICH HE IS. TELL HIM EVERYTHING. SAY, "LORD I LOVE YOU. I... I PRAISE YOU. I THANK YOU." AND THEN SAY, "LORD, I NEED SOME HELP. PLEASE HELP ME." PRAY IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS. AND HE'LL HELP YOU. HE ANSWERS EVERY PRAYER. YOU GET THE GAS, THROW IT UP ON THERE... VAROOM!! MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE? WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS REAL SHORT. AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AT WESTBURY PARK HIGH SCHOOL, WE HAVE DECIDED TO CANCEL THIS YEAR'S HOMECOMING.
