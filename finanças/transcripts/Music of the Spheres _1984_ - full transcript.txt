Negative on that. Sorry Earth... negative to that. Okay, good luck. System integration intact. The rock is moving. They're breaking orbit. Imagine that. We'll be tapping the power of the stars. Imagine the risk. Think of the energy. Hello, center. This is Terra tracking station. Standby for integration. Atlantis confirms. You have permission to Project Sirius. Carve a solar condenser in each asteroid face. This is phase three. Add each body with microwave transmission facilities. Three asteroids will do. Icarus, Hayor, and Sirius. Hello, center. Standby for integration. This is center. We have interlocked. The Beast is in control. Confirming asteroid Sirius is in our control. Good. The Beast moves. Congratulations, Melody. And good words for your beanery twin, too. The Beast handled itself well. How does it feel to have the entire planet passing through your brain? I didn't feel much, actually. -Um, Andrew? -Yeah? I'd like to be alone with the Beast for a minute. Uh, sure, kid. I'm going for a coffee. Join me when you're finished? Yes, that's fine. Oh, excuse me! Sorry. Hello, there. -You're the, uh-- -I'm the new, um... My name is Melody. Well, hello. We've been expecting you. -I'm supposed to meet-- -My name's Andrew. Oh, you're Andrew! Paul says you're very good at computer linkage. -Paul, yes. He said you-- -You're from the East. I'm from the South myself. Oh, yes. Paul said it's special. Right? I'm supposed to meet the bureaucrat. Oh, you don't want to see him. Let me show you around. -But-- -Come! I'll show you the Beast. "The Beast?" Oh, the computer. I call it the Beast. Why? Well, let's just say, you have to be very strong to control it. Are you strong? I'm very strong. Good. Let me show you around. Melody. You've been trained to interlock with the greatest computer man has ever made. And now I can reveal the mission Paul has bene preparing you for. We're embarking on an energy project that will save our people from the misery they've known. Project Sirius involves converting asteroids to solar energy transmitters and placing them in orbits from which they can direct microwave converted energy to earth. You, Melody, and you, Andrew, working with this computer you so fondly call "The Beast", will control the movement of these asteroids. And direct the successful culmination of this project, our faith in the future, and belief in the system. Okay. Here I am. What do you want? I just thought we could have a coffee. Oh, yeah? Like how? There's a purpose to this meeting. -Why do you say that? -I know you. There always is. You should be pleased with yourself. The bureaucrat? Had a good word from Atlantis, said to pass it on to you. Really, Melody. You should be pleased. For 25 minutes, every important thought in the system passed through your brain, well, you and the Beast. All the orders from Atlantis, ...the tracking station, all that information and not a problem! How do you know there wasn't a problem? -Did I miss something? -I don't know. Did you? Every indicator had the Beast functioning perfectly. Then there couldn't have been any trouble, right? I mean, you should know. You're the machine's psychiatrist. Melody, I have to know somethings to do my job. I have to know what you felt during the project. I have to know how the Beast felt. Particularly, if anything went wrong. You must tell me. I felt as if I was up there, Andrew. In space, and that track. Or it's like... it's like it were a sort of living thing. And I was up there with it. There was this tremendous sense of movement. Acceleration. And then floating. Just floating. What else did you feel? This living thing, Andrew. It was as if it felt, well, surprised. And then something like... something like... pain. How long did you feel this way? I don't know. I'm curious though. Were those also the Beast's thoughts, or were they just my own illusions? I don't recall you experiencing any similar effects in the past. Well, I've always shared the machine's thoughts. I never felt myself to actually be somewhere else. I always knew I was in the center, an interlock. Why do you think this time was different? I don't know. In the years that followed the collapse of the world economy, the industrial nations fell into chaos. And the super power crumbled under their own weight. The dark age envelops earth again. Until a new order arrives from the ruins of the former civilizations. The business of running the planet is conducted through a network of super intelligent biological computers situated in states throughout the world. There are no nations anymore. No one language is common to the city states, except the electronic words spoken between the thinking machines. All the orders passed through the system come from Atlantis, the moon base, which harbors the equation and its keepers. The equation is designed to interpret all events on earth and guide the system toward the embankment of planetary equilibrium. Above all, the people of the system are determined that no such ruin would ever beset earth again. ...crossover effect, which occurs with certain individuals who are in an awful context. Now, when we're talking about subjects whose physio-magnetic cortex generation occur at the same frequency as artificial electro-magnetic radiation. Oh, very British. Very pretty. Well, yes. The brain in a sense becomes like a receiver. But you said this hadn't anything to do with telepathy. No, not telepathic towards normal broadcasting, that's... However, once the effect is manifest, Well, when the brain is open to other kinds of input-- What does that mean? "Other kinds of input?" It's an idea that belongs to the past. Good morning, Andrew. Oh, good morning, Melo-friend! I'm fine, Andrew. How are you? I'm okay. How's the Beast feeling? It's happy, Andrew. Relaxed. The triangle of asteroid-based solar collecting converters will assure that the two converted beams of microwave energy will be pointed to earth at all times. Over three asteroids converted to this purpose Icarus, Hayor, and Sirius, the first two are in their new orbits. Sirius, the third and final component in the project, is presently in transport towards its intended new orbit. Melody? Melody. Melody! Melody! What are you? There are no words for the thing that I am. Andrew, what was that? I read a power surge. And we melted circuits, the Beast is operating on backups. Where did the power come from? You tell me. I'm initiating a principal function test. Melody, Andrew, do you hear me? Yes, bureaucrat. Yes, we hear you. We had a total breakdown for some seconds. What is the reason? It's too early to tell the extent of the breakdown. The Beast is on back up. We were out of touch with every center on the planet! Including Atlantis. We'll let you know, sir. This is important. It surprises me, too. We simply lost five seconds, and there's still no accounting for it. But what happened to us? You must have some idea. That's the strangest part yet, Melody. It was there, and then it was gone. But you can't create energy, Andrew. I'm turning to think it was internally generated. I'm tending to think it was something foreign. What, Melody? Every time I'm in interlock, Andrew. I feel like there's something passing through the Beast's brain that doesn't belong there. Something strange. Otherworldly. I'm worried. It's making me uptight. Access codes filed. 3665, This is an emergency. Rapid deviation to 1.5 percent and holding. Shit! Melody, hang on to that machine. I need to talk to the bureaucrat. I'm here. I need clearance to access the codes. Granted. Andrew. It's got me again. I'm out there. I'm floating, Andrew. Melody. Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! Melody! -Melody! -God! What is it? Overload again. Something's getting into the machine. Resetting circuits again. The Beast is going on back up. Melody, Andrew, What in the system's name is happening to us? It's the interference again. I know, damn it. I know! Atlantis is losing touch with the asteroid. No other computer must take over this project. Bureaucrat. I feel as if the Beast is reacting to program invasion. Foreign input. Something from outside. From outside. Outside of what? The system! By definition, that's impossible! Bureaucrat? Do you have anything useful to say? Sabotage? All inputs are self-defensive! No, it must be coming from within. Area agent for unit 17, please report. Well, something's wrong. Yesterday was awful, and today was most awful! More awful. I can't help the facts of matter. At this moment, the Beast checks out perfectly. By every test, it is in perfect physical form. Yesterday, all the tests performed perfectly, too. Juressica lost your stupid asteroid! I can't help it! The beast just-- The entire system broke down, do you understand? The entire system crashed from Atlantis to center. Well, you were inside. You tell me what happened. There's nothing wrong with the Beast's head. There's a foreign source invading the system. I could feel it. You've been feeling a lot of things you won't talk about. Where did the power come from damn it? Internally generated resistance, damn it! Crap. The Beast has a metal bark. Don't give me that garbage. There's no mental digital Freudian block in a computer! There's a physical break down. Where did the power come from? Internal binary resistance, I said! Nothing with the machine circuitry? -Yes! -We were on 49 percent backup! -Yeah, so? -Not internal resistance! Okay! Okay! This is where everyone takes a volume. What's volume? A toy belonging to the industrial order, not needed now that we have obtained equilibrium. Well... you and your friends from the industrial past design this ingenious humanly computer. Perhaps you have an idea what's wrong? I always have ideas. Indulge in a bit of fantasy. And assume that with the integration of Project Sirius comes one little bit of... information. That is cannot assimilate. Well, doctor. There you have your mental block. It becomes a dam. That's your internal resistance. Every time Project Sirius passes through the Beast's brain, the problem is aggravated. Come crisis time like this afternoon, total breakdown! Very clean. But the Beast would reject bad information at the source. An enigmatic computer, yes. But this is a conscious machine. The system is a functioning equation. All information has its influence. By definition, there cannot be any such thing as un-assimilable information. Let's say it was foreign input, where's it coming from? All the access weights of defensive screening. I don't know, Andrew. You tell me. well, it's alright. She's the other half of the Beast. If she feels it's under attack, she'll be defensive. She has to be. Her condition makes her sympathetic to the machine. Mind you, she could be right. About? In theory at least, the Beast should be able to assimilate all information. Out of curiosity, how do you account for the breakdown? I don't. Whatever happens here, whatever happens in that brain, that is Melody and the Beast combined with every other computer in the network. It's more important than any of us. Including Melody! If the Beast is under attack, Melody will be difficult to deal with. She can't help it. She's conditioned that way. That's way I hate the system. I understand. I'm not trying to tell you anything more than to be careful. -That's the truth. -Is it? In case what I said sounds cynical, let me remind you that I do love her. Like you said, you're just trying to tell me to be careful. We understand each other. So mysterious. What kind of thing could possibly so trouble the binary darkness of your computer's soul? You have a world of your own, I know. But listen to me, Beast. As we both know, there is an override system in this room. And thought I will only use it with the greatest reluctance, I will, if necessary, use it to acquire the information I need. I hope we understand each other. Melody. Melody! No! There are no words for the thing that I am. What do you want? The things that are happening to you should be thought of as a warning. You must try harder to understand. Hello, technical. Ready to proceed. Okay. This is technical. Ready to begin tests. We can't seem to see what the problem is. Can Atlantis try a simulation? We can't put our finger on here. All responses check out okay on this end. All functions check out perfectly. There is no problem with the information. Melody, there you are. You're late today. What kept you? I'm sorry, Andrew. I didn't sleep well. I stayed late last night. -Why? -Oh, I had... Atlantis run a simulation break down on a few smaller centrals. Did you learn anything? No. But I had a briefing concerning Project Sirius. -Care to come up? -Sure. Who briefed you? The bureaucrat. The G.O.D.s have had us regain control of Sirius. They still have to go through us for orbital correction. What happens if the Beast... What's there to gain? Maybe the system. I had the technical department repeat their tests on the Beast. All systems. They say the Beast is in fine form. Physically. They didn't trace any program invasion? Technical department says there was no program invasion. Look, I know the Beast better than anyone here. Including you, Paul, and the bureaucrat. And well... What I mean is that there are gods, alien ideas. Things that shouldn't be here invading it. All the time. Even now, I can feel it. You did feel that? Yes. You're not supposed to be that impacted to the machine. It's realized. Melody, this can't be healthy for you. -We should tell the bureaucrat. -I forbid you! I mean, please, Andrew. We're a team. The equations were active. I've noticed. There must be something vast happening on earth. Then as long as we have equilibrium-- Good going. The beast is calmer now. The next time we meet, you will be able to look at me. You will lend me a form of your own creation. But you're not ready yet. Something, Melody. Melody, you must try harder to understand. I... I've met you before. There's something familiar... Time. You're the thing inside the Beast. Hello, Melody? Special lunar transmission in two-- ... system integration coming from? I don't know. They haven't told me. What do you mean you don't know? But the information's been consistent. Well, the Beast doesn't hide information. What kind of precedents do we have for hybrid computers voluntarily restricting information? I'm not aware of any. Hello, Atlantis. This is Data Five. Reports back that the orbit is stabilizing. ...deviation in less than triple zero three percent and decreasing. Data is based on average... All is well. Data five out. Well, I thought I could see something, uh... A pattern of sorts of static interruption. I made a copy. Look at these on five. Now, these pictures are slowed down. We made a randomized scan and came up with a focused pattern. Can you see it, Melody? Well? What does it mean? I'm not sure. I don't know. Damn it. You do so. Think about this for a moment. The Beast is subject to program invasion from source unknown. Well, it tries to protect itself; the way of all living things. Each burst of static is a reaction like pain. It refuses all attempts to reach the cause of said pain. Doesn't make sense, does it? Please. Make sense, Andrew. But still, there's something wrong -with our initial assumption. -Which assumption? That the Beast is trying to protect itself. If it's not trying to protect itself, who is it trying to protect? Who could be most hurt by the content of the program invasion? We don't know that, do we? We don't even know who's at the other end. Look at the pattern on your screen, friend. So? So it's scrambled, Melody. -The Beast scrambled them. -So? We don't know that. So it's an assumption. An educated one I'm sure. If the Beast scrambles the content of the program invasion, that would mean it doesn't want us to receive certain information. What information? The content of the said program invasion. You're talking about the invasion as if it were... Communication. That's a very interesting idea, Melody. If you do what you're proposing, you'll be interfering in the operation of the system. You're a strange girl. If you override the Beast, You're isolated from the guidance of the system. It may be necessary. The Beast has never been denied its privacy before. It's subjectivity is sensitive to its function. Listen to me, Melody. If we don't identify the program invasion, if we don't return the Beast to optimal efficiency, don't Atlantis won't assume control and do it themselves. Just they try! They'll have to! The third and most critical tentative to crack the problems with Sirius will begin in 23 hours. I know. I'm good to go. They will only work with the Beast when they're certain of his dependability. And you know we're the only center capable of integrating a system-wide program of that complexity. There's nothing wrong with the Beast. If information is upsetting it, The relevance to adapt to the information. If the Beast responds now against Project Sirius, it means that the project itself has turned against the balance of the system. Project Sirius is the problem. Admittedly, Atlantis will decide to drop it. You don't actually believe that? The system is working, don't you see? It is telling us to drop the project. I don't believe what I'm hearing. You're out of your mind! You don't actually believe in the equation? -I mean, literally? -It is telling us something. -It is a warning. -A warning? Be digital, be logical, but don't give me that garbage! It's because you don't understand the system. That's not you talking, listen to yourself! That's Paul talking. Paul, not Melody. For one half of the most powerful brain in the system, you can be pretty stupid. I mean, stupidity takes on a new awesome new magnitude in your hands. Andrew! What? I won't let you override the Beast! Stop me! Okay, Beasty. -This is where I get serious. -No! Don't, Andrew! Wait! Wait! Come on! -Take me to the source. -No! Center, this is Atlantis. Your computer has gone into failure mode. Enact remedial measures immediately. I won't let you override-- An accident... The scale! An extraordinary frequency. Strange. It really is coming from beyond the system. Stars. Beast! Andrew! Andrew! Ever since the first breakdown, the Beast has been repressing information. Nonsense. You know the way of the system, Melody. All information is assimilable. Well, then... lay back and just... find... He was dying. He didn't know what you were seeing. What an extraordinary frequency! Strange machine. It really is coming from beyond the system. What does that mean? "Beyond the system?" It's a logical contradiction. What happens now? What do you mean, Melody? I mean, what are we going to do? How do we resolve the contact? In such a situation, there is an operational design to follow. Of course, yes. What is it? The initiatory phase involves a signing a degree of magnitude to the event. That is the subjective trigger manipulated by the responsible authority. That's me. Once that's done, the bobble determines the subsequent measures You're in a high enough classification to understand that the system cannot predict discreet events. The specific must be generalized. That's the way of the system. Then you must sign the degree of magnitude! How do you to be the cause to shut down the Beast? Project Sirius requires the full conscious functioning -of Beast. -We must stop Project Sirius. Melody! You're are exceeding the bounds of your role. Melody. I'm sorry about the death of Andrew. I understand you were friends. We were. I didn't get to know him. But I?am sorry. Paul will assume Andrew's function for the time being. Bureaucrat. We agreed that the Beast is explicitly programmed to believe in the system. No, not explicitly. But the logic of the program is inescapable. What could happen to the Beast, if it came by evidence contrary to the logic? But that's impossible! We've agreed there's no such thing! To do what you just did, bureaucrat. -What? -Deny it. How could the Beast deny information? It's against the way of the system. No, not just the information, it came from beyond the system. But there is no such thing! The stars... I don't understand. That's why you're the bureaucrat. Don't you dare! Andrew's death proved that the equation works. Right to the point of protecting itself by any means necessary. We don't even know what happened to Andrew. He's missing! Well? What do you think happened? Let's just say he's somehow become part of the system. Become part of the system? What do you mean? Don't you walk out on me! What do you mean, Melody? reported computer killing not a verified event. Target system will continue to function according to normal programs. There's no basis for concern. All unit consultants report at 2100 hours. System integration entail. The form I have taken is your imposition. Not my choice. And I confess that it does not suit me so well. This dream is a warning. Dreams are the signs of which the mind interprets itself. Not all dreams come from within. Some are signs from beyond. Just listen to the music. You're my creation! If I do not like this dream, I will send you away. But you won't. You must come with me. -How? -On my back. We don't have much time. Come. Fly with me. -Where are you? -Between worlds. I do not like this place. I want to leave. Between worlds, even you can hear the music. Stop it! Each planet in its power, generates a perfect sound. Not alone to you as light is invisible to them. Them? I am no more one of them than one of you. What are you? I'm something in between. What are they? They listen to the music. They're nothing else. They have to be something. Nothing more, nothing less. Let me be your voice of reason. I'm the voice of Atlantis. The eye of the beast. I am the master work. Every planet in its path has seen through the galaxy. Generates a sound by way of its motion. By the path in which it has been placed. In which it has to be. In which it is an equilibrium. You use words in a funny way. None of your languages have the words needed for my meaning. You must dive, Melody. Listen to your dreams. But... Yes. Does it make a sound also? Yes. Every planet does. What kind of sound? In your language, there is no word. We'll call it a counter point. My earth, is a counter-point? You're lucky. Most planets that size are over-toned. Over-toned? Counter-points? What's wrong with the music? The asteroids. Your people moved them from their true orbit. The Beast knows. The Beast touched the other system. They hear that there is something wrong. So they rewrite the music. The orbits of your counters will change. How the hell will they do that? By wanting to, they will do it. What are you? There's nothing. All right, then. Here we are. Come on. I'll show you. Frank? Yeah, Bill. Go ahead. Yeah, we?ve been getting power failures all over your area. -Is that right? -Yeah! It's real peculiar. You ought to take a look. Well, Bill, I'm kind of tied up right now. You're Andrew! Boss says you're very good at computers. I'm supposed to meet the bureaucrat. Oh, you don't want to see him. -Let me show you around. -But-- Come! I'll show you the Beast. How could the Beast deny information? It's against the way of the system. Good morning, my old friend. They're nothing against the system. It's just... Atlantis is losing control of the asteroid. No other computer can take over this project. One computer killing is hardly a sign of general system dysfunction. I'm very strong. Good. Let me show you where. Hello? Hello! Hello! Shuttle 09 leaving center point delayed to 2200 hours. Andrew? Hello, Andrew. Hello, my old friend. The others have joined their mind to the system. They're turning their powers against Atlantis. Hello, Atlantis. Attention... Sergeant, status. Asteroid Sirius speeding from program trajectory. An act that will give you measure immediately. Information follows in a single digital mode... Data five, out. -We must reveal-- -Code nine. Reporting energy fields of undetermined origins approaching area. -The Atlanta Juressica -Data five, urgent morse code. Censors indicate lunar geo-density instability and gravitational transient. Energy fields progressing around lunar areas. Lunar core heating. Surface breakout. We have surface breakout. Data mine leaving area. We cannot find the moon. It has changed now, my old friend. I can feel it. We have lost Atlantis. And we have lost the moon. The earth has changed, too, Melody. Well, now, it has changed. Are you the ones that listen? I am the thing that remains. If you're anything at all. Perhaps, I am nothing. Well, I know you're real. We have done what was needed. Those who listen are protected. But the system is destroyed. The base is buried. I have no place in this world anymore. Then come. There is always a place for those who hear the music. How can I hear you? There is a way. Show me then.
