I discovered all those lives. Many different sized cocks have paraded across this stage. Some became successful. Others were just weak. Some youngsters were claimed for gays. ''Spa-kol'' became fashionable... with private shows, and internet prostitution. But I stayed. I never gave up on this stage. I know, this place is just a pit-stopp for you. But it's a happy stopover for guys looking for a better life. For their families. I know what you want. But don't let your heart guide you. Reject the anger. Use your head.

Well, I don't blame you. I was embarrassed to see you. Because... I was trying to avoid this moment. Because, what could I say to you... I'd already refused to go with you? Didn't I tell you that I wanted to set up my own brothel? That never happened. I stayed a whore. But men got tired of me. I got fat and old, so I became a pimp. I met Roldan... He was a loyal customer... …with the women I got him. I was in jail, you know? All the cops raped me one after the other. Until they got tired of me. Roldan got me out, thanks to his contacts. I needed to earn more money, So I helped him smuggle drugs. Maybe, maybe I was one of your customers. I don't know, I'm not sure. Among so many hustlers and addicts, why would I... You know, I met a macho dancer's son. He asked me, "why?" It was that simple. But I felt I saw myself reflected in a mirror. We're asking ourselves the same questions. Bambi, we still have the chance to correct our past mistakes. I'll make things good with Inno. Where's he now? I thought he was back with you. Nope. Inno... Inno, I missed you. It's difficult for me to deal with someone who dares to defy me. I punish those who defy me. I'm aroused. I get aroused when you fight back, strip me! Sure. Yes Master. Your wish is my command. what do you want? Everything! Mmmm challenging! This's what you want, right? Exciting. I'm turned on. Fuck you, go and die! Kyle, this is what you've been waiting for! - Help me! - Shoot him! What are you waiting for?! - Kyle! Kyle, what are you doing? Pady! Son... my son... You me dead! You wanted to kill me! Inno?! Pa! Papa, I'm so sorry. I'm the one who's supposed to say, "I'm sorry" to you. Go away, go away. I'll take care of this. Go, leave, I'll take care of this. No, no, it should be me. I killed Jun. Go, escape. Already! Come Inno, this way! His will be the last corpse I bury. No, I'm with you on this. - What's happening here?! - Roldan! What've you done? I didn't want this. I don't want to keep doing this, Roldan. I want to start a new life. Let me go. I want to leave all this. It's okay. I don't want to continue this. Kill me instead! Sir, what comment do you have on the latest murder in San Roque? Our operations already eliminated ... a major drug dealer, Jun Mallari. tell those scumbags out there who're destroying the life of our youth, I tell you, we will not stop until we destroy them all.
