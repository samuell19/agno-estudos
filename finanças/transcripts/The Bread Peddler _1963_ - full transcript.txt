THE BREAD-PEDLAR - Jeanne Fortier is honest. - Fortunately. She's a widow and has to feed her 2 kids. And I have to feed the 80 workers in my factory. - What is it, Ricoux? - I have some cash to give you. Oh yes. What am I thinking?! You can talk in front of Mr Garaud. - He has my full confidence. - Very good sir. There's the 127,017 francs cashed at the bank... plus the week's takings of 66,028 francs , ...making 193,045 francs. - Thanks. That'll be all. - Sir. Jacques, what do you imagine is in this briefcase? A fortune? You may in fact be right. I have finally found... ...after years of searching... ...the machine that can guillotine curved surfaces. Incredible. It will revolutionise the industry, Jacques. And it will certainly bring us a fortune. "Us"? On my own, I'm incapable of developing it technically. You'll become my partner. Mr Labroue...! Oh, this is just my self-interest, to a degree. My son, Lucien, is only 3 years old. Who would maintain the factory, if I disappeared? - I'll do everything I'm able to. - We'll talk about it again. Let's settle the matter of the widow Fortier. Mrs Fortier, you let a worker go out without permission. - But I... - What is that? Petroleum in my factory! Are you crazy? It's for my lamps, Sir. Do you want to set the factory on fire? I'm very careful, Sir. Were you careful to obey the rules? They are quite clear. I didn't know, Sir. This is too much. You can find yourself another position. You're dismissing me? I'm not dismissing you. I'm just depriving myself of your unsatisfactory service. - Where can I go? - Wherever you want. What will become of my children? My Georges, my Lucy, that I had to have a nurse for. That's up to you. Take care, Sir. This won't make you happy. I don't want your opinions. What else? Your train ticket. - The carriage is waiting for you. - Let's go. I'm sorry for what happened, Jeanne. I know, Mr Garaud. Call me Jacques. There's no reason, Mr Garaud. Yes, there are a thousand reasons. Don't cry, please. -I do not know what I did to God. Everyone turns his back on me. -No. Not me. -That is true. You have always been kind to me, Mr. Garaud. Jacques. Jacques. Listen to me, Jeanne... - If you want... - No. You promised not to talk like that again. - I love you. - Don't talk nonsense. It's not nonsense. I can save you... make your children happy. I'll never remarry. You're not going to cry for the rest of your life. Be quiet! Pierre's only been dead 5 months. Pierre was my friend. It's my duty to take care of his children. They are mine. Jeanne... if I were rich... ...would you accept me as your husband? For him, for Lucie. For my children? I don't know. Maybe. You give me the courage to do what I want to do. I have a big project, Jeanne, that will make me a fortune. This wealth, I will lay at your feet. Does that surprise you? Yes, Jacques. At least I succeeded in making you smile. It's as good as done. Mrs Fortier, I prepared your account. Come to the cashier's tomorrow morning. - Where will I go? - Work it out. Good evening. Oh, it's you. - These are the attendance slips. - Thanks. - Did you forget this letter? - No, I didn't forget it. It's to you. - To me? - Yes. I had a lot of things to tell you, Jeanne. I preferred to write them down. You have your happiness, plus that of your children... ...and mine as well, in your hands. My dearest Jeanne... Tomorrow I will be rich. I will have an invention with incalculable benefits... ...and 200,000 francs to exploit it. I'll be expecting you tonight at 9 o'clock with Georges... ...at the crossroads, and we shall go abroad. If you were not to come... ...I don't know to what end despair would drive me. But you will come. September 7, 1861, Jacques Garaud. Do you want to go around the factory with Mummy? You and I will go for a walk. There... Eh? Thank you. Till tomorrow, Sir. You haven't left, Sir? I missed my train. I'll leave tomorrow. Good night. What are you doing there? Jacques... this is impossible! Help! - Follow me. - Never! - Follow me, or... - Georges! Help! Can't you be quiet? You killed him and started the fire! No, it was you! Remember... your petroleum, your jug and your lantern! You're terrible! - Have pity! - You refused my love. - No, Jacques! - You didn't trust me. It's too late. I'm rich. Tomorrow I'll be far away. And you... you will pay for despising me. No, Jacques. No! The letter... The letter he brought me! Are you Jeanne Fortier? She threatened Mr Labroue before my eyes! ?Beware!? she told him. Was it my letter you came for? Too late... Your rooms are on fire. - Jeanne Fortier started the fire. - It was deadly. And the cashier's... All that money... And Mr Labroue! I'm going in. What a brave fellow! He's bringing out a body! - It's the boss. - He was stabbed. - By Jeanne Fortier? - I'd reckon so. I'm going back. - You're crazy! - I have to get the money. It's over... He'd have been crushed. Mary... what's the matter? It's nothing. - Drink this. - Thank you, Mr Castel. - Do you feel better? - Much better. - I had a dizzy spell. - This is all my fault. You've been posing for hours for a week. In a woman, the head spins easily. Never without reason. No, Mary. That's enough for today. I don't want your father accusing me... ...of overworking his only daughter. Don't forget Saturday night. How could I forget it? Your first ball. And I want to see how you dance. Ah, Georges. This is my ward... - Mr Georges Darier. - Miss. My father and I were talking about you, this morning. - He won dad's case. - A simple land question. Father says that no case is simple. My compliments, Georges. I have so much to do with preparations for the ball. Till Saturday. - She's pretty. - Better still... intelligent. Good match, for a lawyer with a bright future. I don't want a ready-made future. - If I succeed... - You will succeed. -...it won't be because of a woman. - How can we ever know? I'm joking. - Is this what I asked you to get? - Yes. - Admit that you're curious. - I admit it, Mr President. My dear Georges, I will show you something... ...that no one has ever seen. Look at this sketched painting. Does it remind you of anything? - No. - You were probably too young. - How old was I then? - 3 and a half. But... ...that's my little horse. - And that would be my mother. - Yes, it's your mother. Who is this woman? Her name is Jeanne Fortier. Jeanne Fortier? The name rings a bell. Hadn't she done something terrible? Theft, arson, murder. - That all? - Yes, that's all. I remember... Jeanne Fortier, of course. A famous case in the annals of justice. - She'd burned down... - ...a factory in Alfortville. - And killed her boss, a toff... - Labroue. Jules Labroue. How was it that this woman was arrested at my uncle's? At that time... ...I was living in Paris and I often stayed in Alfortville... ...with a friend, Felix Laugier, a priest... ...who lived with his sister, Clarisse Darier. - My mother? - Yes, your mother. I spent many days with those fine people... ...painting or sketching. One winter morning... ..we saw this beautiful young woman arriving at Chevry. - Alone? - Yes, alone. All on her own. She said she'd walked all night. I can never thank you enough You're at home, even if we don't know who you are. I didn't catch your name. Since the death of my husband, I no longer have a name. My first name is Jeanne. Jeanne Fortier? You know everything? Already? News travels fast, nowadays. "A particularly heinous triple crime was committed in Alfortville. "Sole suspect is the factory guardian who fled, Jeanne Fortier." - Shall I go on? - No. No it is wrong! Before God, let him hear me... ...and on all I hold most dear, I swear to you that I'm innocent. I swear to you. An oath before God is a serious thing, my child. I'm ready to believe you. So why flee? Father... I'm only a woman. All seemed lost. Believe me, I beg you. I'll tell you everything. When my husband died... Jeanne Fortier told us her story, ...while next to us, unaware of what was happening... ...you, Georges, were fast asleep. Jeanne Fortier had a sincere tone that does not deceive. I confess to you that at the end of her story... ...we were convinced of her innocence. - We believe you. - Oh yes, we believe you. You certainly speak the truth. But the others won't believe me. Your voice, your looks will plead for you. No. The judges sit too far away to read the defendant's eyes. And the words leave them indifferent. No! No, I don't want to go! Stop them! - Are you Jeanne Fortier? - I'm innocent. In the name of the law, I arrest you. So arrest me. Judge me, condemn me... ...you'll not be able to stop me being innocent. My child, if your heart is pure, God will not forsake you. He's already forsaken me. Unanimously... the jurors declare the accused guilty of the crime of murder... arson and theft. By a majority of votes, they admit extenuating circumstances. Consequently... ...Jeanne Fortier is sentenced to life imprisonment. This woman was innocent. It's enough to drive you crazy. That's what happened, my boy. Jeanne Fortier lost her mind. She was locked up in Salpetriere... ...in the service of Professor Charcot. The years passed. In 1870 there'd been the war. Paris was bombarded. Fire in the asylum reminds her of the factory... ...and bring her back to her senses. Fire! It's on fire! Help! Help! Since then she's been in Clermont prison. She had children. What became of them? Social Security... an anonymous and loveless mother. - I must ask why... -...why I told you this story? Why am I interested right now? Artists are overly sensitive beings. I often think to this terrible scene. I've often tried to finish this painting... ...The Arrest of Jeanne Fortier.... But I couldn't. As if something wanted to hold my arm back. You?ll help me to finish it, Georges. - I'm not a painter. - You're a lawyer. Twenty years later? These twenty years represent the suffering of a poor woman. Worth a try, right? - What do we risk? - Here is her file. Study it in your spare time. Do it for me. -I wonder which way... -I have one. Chance or Providence, pick which you want... ...made me find Lucien Labroue, the son of Jules Labroue... ...who Jeanne Fortier was accused of having killed. He's an engineer. - He lives where? - An attic at 3 Rohan Court. - Noted. Goodbye. - Thank you, Georges. It feels strange, that you thank me... ...when I owe you so much Mr Lucien Labroue, please. Up there, on the top floor. Come in, Lucien. Well, open it. What are you waiting for? Hello, darling. Oh sorry. You're not Lucien. No, Miss, I'm sorry... Please forgive the mess. I do sewing and... Such a lovely mess... worth the trouble. I'm looking for Mr. Labroue. He lives in the room at the end of the landing. You're sure to find him there. Thank you very much. Come in, my love. - Attorney Darier. - Attorney? A bailiff... Seize what you want... Do your duty. What do you want to start with? I'm a lawyer. A lawyer in my place? -You are the son of Jules Labroue. - Yes Sir. Your father died in tragic circumstances... ...and the culprit was arrested and sentenced. - I know. I know. - But...? It's not certain that that woman is guilty. According to my aunt, only one man could have committed such a crime. What man? Jacques Garaud, the foreman. He died in the fire. His body was never found. Why are you interested in this? I'm young, like you. And like you, I want to succeed. I came across this file interesting enough to be reopened. I want my father to be avenged. If this woman is innocent, what's been done to her is monstrous. What should be done? Let's interrogate her in Clermont prison - When do we leave? - In a few days. I have things to attend to. And I'm as free as the wind. I wear myself out looking for a job. I may have one for you. - Are you serious? - Always. Tell me. A client is setting up a factory. He'll never refuse me. - Seeing you're so helpful... - I must be dreaming. Tomorrow I have to meet Mr Paul Harmant. I'll talk to him. Paul Harmant? The big American industrialist? That's him. Get your Lanterne! Get your Lanterne! A glimmer in obscurity. A light in the dark. La Lanterne... ...the only publication that enlightens opinion. Paper, Sir? - What? - Want a paper? Surely you can see I have one. Nice house, eh? Not bad. Must be pretty spiffy inside. I don't know, I'm always on the street. My good man, tell the one who gave you this beautiful outfit that I wish to speak to him. - You have an appointment? - With Paul? Of course not! - You're joking? - Is the master expecting you? Paul's been waiting for me for 20 years! What is it? This gentleman... Yoo hoo! Hello, it's me. You may retire... Go on! Pipsqueak! What a pain! Can't get servants anymore. What's this all about?! It must be Mr Paul Harmant whom I have the honour of addressing? I'm Paul Harmant. What do you want? I embrace you, cousin. I beg your pardon?? I said I embrace you! Who are you? You don't recognize me? Ovide. Ovide Soliveau. I don't know any Soliveaus... ...and certainly no Ovides. So my men will throw you out the door. No one throws Ovide Soliveau out the door. He'd come back through the window. - You rang, Sir? - Yes, Perkins. The charming quadruped... I would never have believed that Paul Honore Harmant... ...son of Cesaire Harmant and Desiree Soliveau... ...would throw out the very own son of his dear mother's sister... ...as soon as they met face to face... ...after twenty years of cruel separation. Bring us some champagne, Perkins. That's the spirit! Champagne... Off you go! I don't understand a word what you tell me... For the last time, tell me who you are. Who I am? Destiny, quite simply, my dear cousin, A somewhat crumpled destiny, of empty stomach and empty purse. A destiny that didn't make a fortune. A destiny upon whom life has cast a curse. Ovide Soliveau. Born in Dijon, Cote-d'Or, capital of the Bourgogne. Population 56,250. Celebrated for its wines and mustards. No fixed address. Social status... none. Marital status... single. Bank account, blank. Professions undertaken,,, all, including apple-cruncher... ...but excepting MP, soldier and policeman. Hobby... Poetry. Yes. That, I recognise that doesn't mean anything. But I can't help it, it's in my nature. I haven't been edited yet because of the envious. Victor Hugo gave me a lot of trouble. Main flaw... Curiosity. Main virtue... Discretion. Oh, I forgot... Ferocious appetite and unquenchable thirst... ...to the extent that I don't need to drink. I am always thirsty. Very amusing. But I still don't know what you want. What I want? But I don't want anything, my dear cousin. Stop constantly calling me "my dear cousin". You're right... The cousin I loved with tenderness is dead... ...tragically. When I received this paper... It's a death certificate... all good and proper. Well, I cried. I agree that's ridiculous, but... ...it's not my fault, I'm sensitive. "I certify... Friday 13th of April..." You appreciate that? He died on a Friday the 13th. It didn't bring me luck. Destiny, eh? - May I? - My pleasure. How many do you want for this piece of paper? Nothing will make me, my poor dear cousin. What a stupid thing to do! No one No one's going to believe your word against mine. The writing burns, and the words fly away. That's just a copy! The original is well-secured. My dear cousin... You know who you're talking to, you rascal? I am Paul Harmant. You're a total nobody. I still don't know your real name. Paul Harmant, whose identity you stole, died in Geneva in 1856. I possess the original death certificate. For years I've waited for this moment. I couldn't afford to go to America. But it's not Paul Harmant who lives here... It's his ghost. It's all make-believe. A house of cards that would collapse at the slightest breath. You don't exist. What a scandal in the industry... 10,000 "Favourite cousin of the deceased unmasks the impostor." 20,000 "Not heard from, for 20 years" 50,000. That's my last word. No, my dear cousin. Ovide Soliveau always has the last word... ...if only to say thank you. The last word belongs to me... To be spoken with laughter. I'm a master at this. A master at blackmail. Oh, here we go... The big words, suddenly... But no. I did not come to extort money from you. I came here to offer you a deal. You'd shoot me dead in cold blood? I'm someone like the Duc de Guise... I'm greater dead than alive. My body would be a liability. We'd read in the papers... ...that Paul Harmant bravely shot a burglar... ...who'd broken in to his home. That won't hold water. What about my will? Your will? Why a will? You've neither fortune nor family. Oh, sorry. As family, I have a cousin. And as fortune, a death certificate. It is safe with a notary together with my will. See? I accept... just to make you happy. Although you wanted to kill me, I must stay alive. And I don't know how to do anything. Now get the hell out of my house... And may I never see you again. How can you talk like that to an old cousin? We're not going to part like this. We should celebrate. How about an intimate little dinner together? I've dreamt about it for 20 years. Great. I see you agree with enthusiasm. Say tonight, 8 o'clock, at the Golden Pheasant. Eh? I've booked a private room in your name. Bye-bye, cousin. Stove pipe. Oh, stop all this nonsense-talk. You'll end up crying into your glass. You're right. It would spoil such a nice chartreuse. It'd be better to drink it. Come on, cheers, cousin. Oh... truly...! Truly, I am sorry... How clumsy of me! It's the least one can say. I'll pour you another one. It brings luck, to spill a liqueur. Maybe you aren't such a bad bugger after all. - You really think so? - Else, why would I say it? For me, truth is sacred. No need to force it out of me. - Have I tried to? - No, but... ...there are ways to force you to tell it. - Torture... - So ordinary. Have you ever heard of the truth liqueur? An oriental liqueur? I heard about it in New York. Humbug. Those who drink it tell everything they want to hide... ...and after, they remember nothing. Isn't that amazing? Humbug! No one will ever manage to make me say... ...anything I don't want to say. I'm sure of it. You can be. But you see... we scarcely know each, Ovide. May I call you Ovide? Feel free, Paul. Well, Ovide... ...this morning, I'd never seen you before... ...nevertheless, this evening... ...I can't help feeling that we're old friends. You're far from despicable. I must say, you're a funny guy. A scoundrel, yes. I won't accept that! Yes, you'll accept it. Do you know why you'll accept it? Because in me... ...you have an even bigger scoundrel than you are. - You? - Yes, me. I'm a scoundrel. But a scoundrel with class. A scumbag of genius. You, Paul Harmant, a scumbag? Paul Harmant... Paul Harmant... Oh, I'm hot. You hear? - I'm hot! - I'm not deaf. Everyone thinks my name is Paul Harmant... Even you, Ovide. Eh? People are dumb. People are stupid! Do you know my real name? Garaud. Garaud? Thank you. We won't need you anymore. You were saying? Jacques Garaud. Jacques Garaud. Paul Harmant... ...worked with me in Switzerland. He died in hospital. He gave me his family record to return to his family... But he no longer had a family. Except me. Except you. You. Who would imagine... ...you?re be going to scare me with what you know? But you know nothing, my poor Ovide. Nothing... Maybe I gave him too much. Paul! Paul, Paul, Paul... When you wake up, you'll think you drank too much... ...and you'll remember nothing more. That right, cousin? They're nice, my family. Jeanne... Jeanne Fortier... The widow Fremy lived here a long time ago. I am looking for a little girl that she cared for... ...little Lucie. The mother had to leave France and she couldn't take it back. When was that, Sister? Eighteen years ago. The widow Fremy lived here, but she died. And the child? Social Security collected her a long time ago, At the start of the war. You could find out at the prefecture. The authorities there. - The authorities? - Certainly, Sister. I am most grateful. Hey, Sister...! I have old clothes for your poor. Wait a moment. I'd kept them. Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm sorry there's not more I can tell you. It doesn't matter, Father. Since 1861, nearly 20 years have passed. The old priest died in 1870. His sister died long before. - And his sister's son.... - His sister's son? A charming toddler. Did you know him? Yes. I was his nanny. Well, then I understand your interest. Alas, I cannot be of any use to you. And I don't know who could be. The town hall burned down in the war, along with all the civil records. That's all I can tell you. Thank you anyway, Father. I'd be surprised is you find that child. Unless Providence come to your aid. I shall pray for you. Try to see the authorities anyway. The authorities... Thank you, Father. Goodbye, Madam. May God bless you. - Have you ever been here? - I'm here from my province. You'll see it's a House of God. If you're out of a job, this is the place to come. Hi, Marianne. Looking for a seat? I'll find you one. Over there. - Hello, Tourangeau. - Hi, Brioche. - May I? - Certainly. - All well, Tourangeau? - It depends... - The boss gets angry. - He'll get over it. When he's found a good bread-pedlar. The woman we had, got on his nerves. So he fired her. You wouldn't have one handy, would you? You kidding? A good bread-pedlar's as scarce as hen's teeth these days. What would you like, Ma'am? - The same. - Very well. And you? How about a little beaujolais. A bread-pedlar earns well. 4.50 a day and 2 pounds of bread. - I don't make that. - But you're good for nothing. Cheers! Excuse me, Sir... At your service. I heard what you were saying about a bread-pedlar position. - It interests you? - Yes, but... You don't have what it takes? If it takes strength and courage, I have it. - Would they try me? - That, I'm sure. He needs someone badly. Go and see him this afternoon. Ask for Mr Lebret, ...at the Lyons Bakery, 15 rue Dauphine, Say Tourangeau sent you. That's me. Come on kids... go play somewhere else. Scram! If I catch you, you'll feel my broom! They have to have fun. I pretend to be angry and they enjoy it even more. Are you the new bread-pedlar? - I'm the concierge. - I guessed that. Are you bringing me my bread? Yes, Miss. - 2 pounds, right? - Yes. Come in... I'll pay you. - Here it is. Right? - Yes. Thank you miss. - You look very tired. - A little bit. The round's long, and it's my first day. - Would you like to sit down? - No, thanks... It's over for this morning. Oh, what a pretty dress... - Are you a seamstress? - At your service. I will never wear this! Me neither. I'm happy just to sew it. - You have good taste. - Thank you. I also make simple dresses. If one day... - You'd make it? - It's my profession. - Darling, something amazing. - You scared me. Our new bread-pedlar. Lucien, my fiance. - Hello. - Ma'am. Read it. I can't believe it. - It's an invitation. - That's right. - To a ball. - Yes. See who it's from? Paul Harmant, the great industrialist. And in addition to the invitation, he wants to see me. - Georges Darier... - Georges Darier? A lawyer. He told him about me. You wouldn't know Harmant. No, but I know his daughter, Mary. This dress is for her. You're a secretive one! Don't be silly...! I never hide anything from you. That's true. Our future may be decided at this ball. Oh, ma Lucie... - You're name's Lucie? - Yes, Ma'am. It's a pretty name. Yes... Yes, it's a very pretty name. It's a name I like very much. I'm glad you like it, Ma'am. I must go. Goodbye, see you tomorrow. - Goodbye Ma'am. - Lise. - But they call me Mama Lison. - Goodbye, Mama Lison. Goodbye... Goodbye Miss Lucie. Lucie... It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous! You're sweethearts, I love you! Oh, Elisabeth! She's going to finish by going crazy. Would it be fun for you to become a great dressmaker? Yes and no. Yes, because I'd mix with rich people. - And why no? - Elisabeth! I'd go crazy, too. Elisabeth? A lady sent by Eugene Labiche. - What is it? - Hello, Augustine. Hello, sweetie. I'm looking for Elizabeth. Elisabeth! Hello, Miss Harmant. - Hello, Augustine. - Have you seen Elizabeth? She disappeared. Your dress is ready. You can try it, even if it's unnecessary. It's perfect. Amanda, take Miss Harmant for her fitting. See you soon, my pets. Augustine is very exuberant this morning. She's always that way. Hello, Miss. - Is this my dress? - Yes Miss. It's gorgeous. Gorgeous! - May I kiss you? - My pleasure, Miss. You have exquisite taste. - How long have you been here? - 15 months. So why aren't you here permanently? - I prefer to work from home. - At your parents'? I have no parents. You're an orphan? - I don't know. - You don't know? - I was under Social Security. - I'm so sorry. Lucie, I want you to make all my dresses, from now on. Oh, I'm so grateful, Miss. - Where do you live? - 3 Rohan Court. Well, I'll come to see you. I live in a very modest room, and I'm afraid that... Don't you worry, Lucie. I want you to be not only my dressmaker... ...but also my friend. Thank you. You are so... Oh, God! Amanda, help! - Madame Augustine! - You called? She fainted again. - Again? - It often happens to her. Poor thing. What's going on? It's Miss Harmant. She's dead? No, Ma'am... she's just fainted. You'll be alright. So, doctor? The usual fit. - Serious? - No more or less than before. These fits don't last long. She should be up and about before long. Is there a danger? For the moment, none, if she watches herself. You know, this illness is terrible. There is no known cure... ...at the moment. I'm sure that one day... ...we'll be healing T.B. like a simple cold. But what should I do? Tell me, please. I'd give all I have. To no avail, Mr Harmant. Just give affection... Lots of affection. Give her whatever she wants. She'll have that, I promise. And above all, no disappointments. Save her from sorrow and dark thoughts... I shall. Frankly, Mr Harmant, in her state.... ...the slightest annoyance can have unpredictable consequences. Even fatal. - Be brave. - Goodbye. Don't hesitate to call me at the slightest warning. Has that old fellow left? Mary, go back to bed. With all I have to do? What do you expect? Mary, you have to be sensible. Daddy dear... a sensible woman would be boring. Am I boring you? You know very well that you never bore me. But you lack of good sense worries me. Come on. I love you, Daddy dear. You're so kind, so good. I'd like to be like this for the rest of my life. I know that soon... Come on, be serious, Miss. Don't say silly things, and don't do silly things. It's so nice doing them. Ah, this ball... I've dreamt of it since I was a little girl. A ball just for me. - You'll be the belle of the ball. - And have Paris at my feet. Oh, Daddy dear, I'm so happy. Her Grace, the Duchess of Modragov. The Count de la Roche. Mr Georges Darier. Mr Lucien Labroue. - Counselor. - Miss. Georges Darier, my father's lawyer. My pleasure. This is the friend that I told you about. - Lucien Labroue, engineer. - Miss. Miss Mary Harmant. Delighted to meet you, Sir. My father will also be delighted to make you acquaintance. That's very flattering, Miss. Counselor, according to my card, this dance belongs to you. Delighted, Miss Harmant. You'll be even more delighted to give it to your friend. We can chat. I'm at your command, Miss Harmant. Excuse us, Prince. Georges. Finally... Happy to find you. Now that you've found me, how do you find me? As handsome as ever. Come, let me introduce you to a very old friend. He's the Chief of Police, unfortunately. But don't worry, it's a temporary job. Oh, Etienne... I beg your pardon. Where have you been? You disappeared. No need to have me searched... I surrender to you. I want to introduce you my ward... Georges Darier, the young lawyer I told you about. Delighted, Sir. You've asked to meet Jeanne Fortier... - ...at Clermont Prison. - That's correct, Sir. It would be a futile journey. Jeanne Fortier disappeared from Clermont, over a week ago. She escaped, my friend. Escaped? How did she do that? She disguised herself as a nun. Surprising for a woman known for exemplary behaviour.. She drugged one of the nuns and borrowed her clothes. She got out of jail without difficulty. If they get out that easily, what will become of us? - Incredible. - But true. You'll have to wait till we get her back. - If you get her back. - Be patient. It is one of the virtues of the police. We have time. Leaving already Sir? My regards to Miss Mary. She'll be disappointed you fled so early. The police don't flee, they pursue. Who's dancing with my daughter? My friend that I spoke to you about. Ah yes, the young engineer. I think you'd find him very pleasing. - He's intelligent. - Good. - Hard-working. - Very good. - Clever. - Not so good. - Well, very capable. - That's better. - Unselfish. - Too bad for him. - And ambitious. - Too bad for me. My daughter likes him. Let's hope he's as good a calculator as he is a dancer. The kind of young man you need for your new plant. General. Dad, let me introduce you to my friend Lucien. - My father. - Sir. We were just talking about you. Let's go to my office. We'll be more comfortable there. I'll let you go, until the next dance. Mary dear, I'm on your card for 3 dances. Will you agree to grant me this one? Delighted, Prince. Delighted. The man I need as construction manager... ...will have enormous responsibilities. He should spare neither his time, nor his efforts. He will be well paid... ...but I'll insist upon his total dedication. Do you feel capable of it? I will do everything to earn your trust. Sit down. - I can stand. - As you wish. - Here's to you. - And to you, Sir. I believe I'm a good judge of men... ...and i have a good feeling about you. Glad to hear that. - How old are you? - 25, Sir. - Parisian? - I was born in Alfortville. Alfortville? - Yes, south of Paris. - Yes, I know it. - Parents living? - No, Sir. My mother died at my birth. And your father? He owned a factory. - In Alfortville? - Yes, in Alfortville. I didn't catch your full name. Lucien Labroue. - Labroue... - Yes, Sir. Labroue. - Did you know my father? - Yes. Yes, I knew your father. - Jules Labroue, wasn't it? - Yes sir. - Are you feeling alright? - Yes, I'm fine. Quite alright. But understand my emotion, hearing pronounced by chance... ...the name of a man I esteemed... ...and whose tragic end I learned of, while I was in the United States. - You learned how he died? - Yes. If my memory's correct, the culprit was punished. -The one thought to be guilty was. - What? Jeanne Fortier may have been innocent. The charges against her were overwhelming. My aunt thought another person had an interest in my father's death. - Who? - The factory foreman. My father gave him the secret of his invention. He could have killed him to get it. - His name? - Jacques Garaud. That name does ring a bell. But didn't they say that he'd died in the fire? His body was never found. He could have escaped. - Do you have proof of that? - No, none. All seems very vague to me... ...and relying on assumptions. No doubt. But some forebodings don't deceive. One day the real culprit will be punished and my father avenged. A little champagne? But all this happened twenty years ago. Isn't there a statute of limitations? If fate should hand my father's murderer to me... ...I won't be seeking justice from the legal system. A noble sentiment. I certainly like you very much, young man. . You've got the job. - I don't know what to say. - Don't say anything. Just prove to me that I've done the right thing. I want the planning studio up and ready in 3 days. Provisionally, we'll install it here. I want to have you on hand day and night. You'll live at the town house... and you'll have your meals there. Sir... 12,000 francs a year suit you? - It seems to me... - Too little? Let's say 15,000. - To your success. - To your health, Sir. - Am I disturbing you? - Not at all. I've finished my meeting ...with my new construction director. Congratulations. I'm delighted, Lucien. - Thank you Miss Harmant. - Call me Mary. Thank you, but... - That's an order! - In that case... Here's another order... Come and dance. Bye bye Daddy dear. Yoo-hoo! - Good evening. - What are you doing here? - I was just passing by. - Through the window? You forbade me your door. I had to go in somewhere. - You've been listening? - I heard, that's different. You got your money. You weren't supposed to come back. The one standing before you tonight is not the Ovide you met before. He's a wreck... ...an unfortunate victim of fate. Your money? Down the drain. The usual for cash. A woman? No, a lady, my heart-throb... ...if i had one. She cleaned me out... ..and I shouldn't have let her. - So that...? - I'm broke. - You won't get another penny. - Excuse me? - Not a farthing. - You had me worried. I thought you were refusing to lend me any money. You were right... I do refuse. That can't be the generous Paul Harmant who's talking? Unless it's more likely Jacques Garaud. Excellent cigar. What was that name you mentioned? Did I mention a name? Yes, you did. - What name? - Why, yours, of course. Come along, cuz... Drop the mask. Your name is Jacques Garaud... ...who burned down the factory at Alfortville... ...murdered Jules Labroue, and stole the invention. The hero Jacques Garaud, who had a woman condemned in his place. Shall I go on? How did you find out? You admit it... I like that better. You can't do anything against me. There's a statute of limitations. For the theft, the fire, and the murder... ...but not for assuming the name of Paul Harmant. Why are you laughing? I'm thinking of the look on the police chief's face... ...when he sees the death certificate of the real Paul Harmant. The fabric you've chosen is delightful. Yet it's the cheapest that I found. Have you been dressmaking, long? 6 years, Mama Lison. You did your apprenticeship in Paris? Yes, but I started to learn at the hospice, where I grew up. You grew up in the hospice? I've never known either my father or mother. Not even your mother? I was dropped off when I was little at the foundlings centre. Long ago? 17 years. - How old are you? - 19 19... Do you know by whom you were abandoned? No. The hospice never tells. I'd have loved my mother infinitely, if I'd known her. It's never occurred to me to blame her. It wasn't her fault. It couldn't have been. Maybe it was suffering, misery... ...or hunger, which forced her to put me where I was safe. Maybe my father's dead. But... this first name of Lucie that you have... I know where it comes from. When I was left at the hospice, it was St Lucie's Day. - St Lucie's Day? - I was baptised Lucie. Yes, of course. Have you ever been married? Yes. But my husband is dead. Do you have children? No. No, I have no children. Would you have liked to have any? No, I don't think so. Lucie... victory. I bring you good fortune. Hello, Mama Lison. Now you'll live like a lady... ...because I've managed to get... - A job? Better than that, my love... an executive position. - Now we can get married - Oh, Lucien...! Miss Lucie, will you marry Mr Lucien Labroue? What's the matter, Mama Lison? It's nothing. - A bit of fatigue. - You have such a tiring job. You said your name was Lucien Labroue. - Is your father still alive? - No, Mama Lison. He was murdered in his factory in Alfortville. - Who did that? - A woman. - That's what the judges decided. - But...? I believe she's innocent. If, one day, I should find her... ...she could tell me just what happened. - Enough of talking about that. - Let's be happy. - I'm so happy. - Me too. - But I have to leave you. - Already? I have to live at Mr Harmant's place. But I'll come here often. If you allow it, I will come too. Of course, Mama Lison. How about living here? His room will be free. - What do you say? - You think so? I'd feel more comfortable with you being here. Well, it's agreed. I'll leave you now. I wish you every happiness. As I'd like to wish my own daughter... ...if I had one. - Happy with your installation? - We'll start tomorrow. Excellent. Lucien, I'm equipping a factory on the Rhone, at Bellegarde. I would like you to go to monitor the assembly. It's important. - Come and get the file. - Yes, Sir. No one's holding you back? - No, Sir, not right now. - Not right now? - Well, I?ve got engaged. - Oh, very good. - A decent girl? - Better than that. - Pretty? - Very beautiful. - Of course. - Money? - Poor but honest. - My congratulations. Be happy all the same. How are things going with our new manager? Well. - I don't see you anymore. - Work. Don't be fooled by Dad... He'll work you to death. - He's been very nice to me. - I should hope so. Going out? - To see my dressmaker. - I need to talk to you. Lucien, get the Bellegarde file from my office, please. See you later. - You'll dine with us? - My pleasure, Mary. Mary... Mary... ...are you happy? When I'm with you, I'm always happy. Of course. But fatherly affection is not enough to fill... ...a young girl's heart. I was watching you at the ball... ...and I've never seen you so radiant. Have you, perchance, fallen in love? Why not? It seems to have been very sudden. Mum was American... We know how to decide quickly. I guess so. - I know him? - Yes. - Handsome? - Very handsome. - He's rich? - Poor. "Poor but honest." It's not too serious. Le prince is from a great family. You mean that fool who follows me everywhere like a dog. The one I love is a man, a real man. Lucien is wonderful. Lucien Labroue? I love him more than anything. The moment I saw him, I knew that he'd be the only one I'd love. I'll be his wife. That's impossible. - Why is it impossible? - No, not him. Father, do you love me? You can never know how much. Then give me Lucien. Anything you want, but not that. Lucien Labroue will never be your husband. - Mary... - He will be. Mary... Non, Mary, answer me. Yes, anything you want, but answer me... You'll be his wife, I promise. Answer me. Perkins! My pet. My pet... Miss Mary! Quick... the doctor. Quickly! Dearest... Dearest... Lucien... Where's Lucien? You'll be his wife, Mary. - His wife? You swear? - I swear to you. You'll have everything you could want. Aren't you afraid to stand out? Ovide Soliveau is not only known for his cleverness. Want to know who that girl is that Lucien wants to marry? You'll know... ...which job... - 2 weeks is so long. - I'll write to you. - You swear to me? - I swear to you. I'm worried leaving you alone here. Mama Lison comes every day. She's so nice... See! Here she is already. What? You here? I promised to come to your place. Please come in. Lucien? Mary. What a surprise. I've come to see my dressmaker. And I came to see my fiancee. Your fiancee? You're getting married? As quickly as possible. Congratulations. Mary... It's nothing. Just a turn. - Rest for a bit. - I'd rather leave. I'll see you home. No, please... stay with Lucie. I'm absolutely fine now. She's not well, that person. You know, we've seen worse. I don't know what would make little Lucie happy. She doesn't have a girlfriend who could help me? - Yes. Miss Amanda. - Amanda? She also works at Augustine's. My, what a beautiful girl! And nice... She only has one sin... gluttony. You know her favourite? Crayfish! Really? - You know what that means? - Better than you think. Well, goodbye. If Mary doesn't marry Lucien... ...it could kill her. Lucie has to disappear. And you'll make it happen. Me? Oh no, cousin, don't count on me. I'm just a petty criminal.... That's what you told me. Cheat at poker, accept a little money here and there, okay. But don't count on me to kill someone. Do it yourself... You have the experience. Recognise your signature? These promissory notes are perfectly in order. 120,000 francs. Your "heart-throb", remember? They're gambling debts. - But I paid it to... - The boss of the gambling club. I bought them back. If they are not honoured tonight... ..I will see myself, to my great regret... ...obliged to lodge a complaint with the prosecutor's office... ...who will send you to prison for a long time. I will see to it. You got me, eh? Let's say we've got the goods on each other. - And God knows... - It's hard to believe, but I'm afraid. I've never personally killed anyone. I'm not asking you to kill... What I want is for this Lucie to be out of the way. How you do it is up to you. You know who she is. Find out her habits. I can seduce her best friend, Amanda. Excellent! Otherwise, just come up with an idea. After all, we are all mortal. You'll only be giving a helping hand to fate. And remember... ...what is meant to be, will be. "Come up with an idea" I've never had an idea like that... ...ever. Miss, can you tell me if Miss Amanda is in? - There she is, Sir. - Thanks, pet. Excuse me, Miss... Baron Arnold de Reiss. I don't know Baron de Reiss. Allow me... I am Baron Arnold de Reiss, But I don't know you. Let us become acquainted. I certainly know of you. You're name is Miss Amanda... ...and you have the finest ankles in Western Europe. Could you please just tell me what do you want with me? To say just 3 words to you... I love you. I have words for you, too. Be on your way. But I'm going the same way as you.. I'm not one to be swept off my feet by pretty words. - I'm not some loose-living individual. - Congratulations. I'm going to lunch. That's wonderful... Let me buy you some oysters... - You're so trite! - ...with a partridge.. - On a canape? - By candlelight. Too compromising. It's too dangerous. Some crayfish? - Crayfish... - Cooked alive. - Cooked alive? - Yes, Miss. Cooked alive. - But I shouldn't insist... - It's just that... - It's your right to refuse. - I... You want to pass for an honest girl. I'll show you that I know how to enjoy myself. - I accept. - Oh, you make me so happy. I'm glad I can make you happy.. I look forward to it! So what did you think of those decapods? Wonderful! - What are "decapods"? - You ordered them 3 times. Oh, the crayfish! - That's their family name. - Only 3 times? It's up to you to start again tomorrow evening. Tomorrow night? Oh no, I can't. - I already have a rival? - Not yet. I'm a free woman, dear Arnold. Free, except in friendship. I have to accompany a friend who's delivering a dress in the suburbs. I can't leave Lucie alone at night... ...in a deserted area, rife with prowlers. - Lucie? - Yes, she's my best friend. She works with me at Augustine's. Too bad you're not free tomorrow night. I'd reserved a box for you at the theatre. Don't insist, Arnold. it just can't happen... ...for poor Lucie to be out all alone at night. Oh no, it can never be. - So? - It's done. - Thank you. Don't mention it. Tomorrow you'll go and find out the reactions are. Is that really necessary? Get the news. Otherwise you'll have news from me. Where were you? You've been gone for hours. I don't like this kind of show... ...so I went to smoke a cigar with my friend Paul Harmant. Paul Harmant... the American millionaire? That's him. Gosh, you sure have connections. The only ones that interest me are the ones I have with you. - Arnold, you're a rascal. - So I've been told. Lucie... at last! Oh, pardon me, Miss. - I thought it was Lucie. - I'm her friend, Amanda. You must be Mama Lison. She often speaks of you. Isn't she home? She hasn't been here all night. - I'm very worried. - Oh, my God! If something's happened to her, I'll never forgive myself. Police. It had to happen. Lise Perrin? Yes, Sir. Commissioner Leguet. That's fine, Sir. I'll come with you. It won't be necessary. The girl will be brought back during the day. - An accident? - Street assault. My God, Lucie... - Is she...? - She's alive. Badly wounded, but not critical. She's in hospital. You don't have the right to park here. I'm waiting for someone who won't be long. - Who? - A lady. A lady? Who won't be long? Are you kidding me? You deserve a ticket. - I'll tear it up. - What? Anyway, here she comes. Get going. It's awful... Lucie... - Lucie? - She was stabbed. It's my fault. It's not your fault that she's dead. She's not dead. Not dead? No, thank God. Doesn't that make you happy? One gets emotional at my age. What repugnant individual could commit such a crime? You can say that again. He'll soon be arrested. The police found the knife at the scene. They'll find out where he bought it and the wretch will be guillotined. Coachman! Stop. Aren't you coming? No, I'm in a hurry. I have to go back home. I'll leave you the coach. Moron. Cretin, Poor idiot. Why a poor idiot? You're useless. But you warned me you couldn't do anything. - I can't help it if she survives. - You'll pay for that. - Again. - Think about your promissory notes. That's all I think about. You're not going to force me to do it again? Oh no. You're going to find out who this Lucie is. She was under Social Security. Well, we must be able to find out who her parents were. Work on finding out. Find the origin of an abandoned child... What a job! Now close your eyes. Watch... There,,, You shouldn't have brought me so many gifts. The main thing is that you get better. - How do you feel? - With you, wonderful. She'll soon be able to go back to work. - If only... - Forget it. I wasn't here. Mama Lison hasn't left me. Thank you Mama Lison. With you, Lucie and I feel less alone. It's as if we'd never lost our mother. If fate wills it, we shall never part. I have to make my report for Mr Harmant. - He's waiting for me. - Can't he wait a little longer? No my darling... He's my boss. It's thanks to him that we can get married. - A good trip, Sir? - Excellent. Mr Harmant in? He's expecting you, Sir. Hello. - I was waiting for you. - How nice of you. - You're well? - Fine, now. - Your father's waiting for me. - He can wait some more. He won't be happy. I'll have him excuse you... I want to talk to you, Lucien. Gladly, but later. No, now... it's very important. I'm sure it is, but... Ah, Lucien. - How was your trip? - Very good, Mr Harmant. - So come on in. - We were talking, Daddy, You can do that later... I need to talk to Lucien too. Very well, I'll wait. How do you find Mary? How do I find her? Very pretty, Sir. - That's not what I meant. - I beg your pardon then. She worries me, Lucien. She's pale, nervous, tired.. - She is ill, my friend. - I'm sorry, Sir. We'll change the subject. Lucien, I received a note from our Bellegarde clients. They're delighted with you. I am too, for that matter. And I would like to know if, on your side... ...you are happy working for me. Why wouldn't I be? Thanks to you, one day I'll be able to achieve my life's ambition. Which is? Rebuild my father's factory, on the same site, in Alfortville. I wanted to tell you about something. I want to build a chain of factories in the suburbs... ...and I need land. I need yours But I don't want to sell it. Who said anything about selling? I'm proposing to you to build a factory there... ...of which you will remain the owner. We'll operate it jointly. This would be your contribution to our partnership. Because I want to make you my partner. Your partner? - But I have nothing, except... - Except youth... ...courage and talent. I'm not 20 anymore. When I die, what will become of my business? And especially, what will become of Mary? - Mary? - Yes, Mary. Because I want to make you not only my partner... ...but my son-in-law, as well. Mary loves you. I can't help it, that's how it is. - But... - She loves You! I know you don't love her. At least not yet. When I married her mother, I had some affection for her. Love came later. What you're telling me is very embarrassing. I understand, my boy. Fate is sometimes very strange, . But you have to marry Mary... ...to save her. - It's impossible. - Why? She displeases you? You found her pretty just now. Her life is in your hands. Unless you marry her... ...as she is wishing with all her soul... ...you'll be killing her. If I accept, I'll be killing the one I love. - She's unworthy of you. - Enough! - You know who she is? - A decent girl. Yes, so what? - Where's she from? - An abandoned child. - Is that a shame? - Of course not. - Her parents? - I don't care. Her mother is a criminal. That's impossible. The criminal who killed your father. - Lucie was the daughter... - Of Jeanne Fortier, yes. I don't believe you. Do you believe this document? Read it. This is the record of the admission of Lucie Fortier... ...daughter of Jeanne Fortier, to the foundlings centre... ...signed by the Director of Social Services. Lucie... ...the daughter of Jeanne Fortier? Lucien, I beg of you... I'm doing this for your well-being. Lucie... ...daughter of... Become my partner... ...marry Mary.... and you'll forget about her. You'll see... you'll forget her. Lucien. Another drop of arquebuse? Thank you. It's good at your place, Georges. So peaceful... - Come more often. - I'm so busy. He's not in, Sir. You're quite pale... Sit down. - Interesting. - It's not possible. - This document is indisputable. - Lucie... ..daughter of Jeanne Fortier? - Who gave you this? Paul Harmant. Very interesting. But strange. What did he say to you? He wants me to marry his daughter. So that's it I don't know what to do. The main thing is to play for time. Let him hope that you'll marry his daughter. That's impossible. What do you have to lose? You know that Mary is very sick and has not long to live. We can then find Jacques Garaud... ...who may be easier to find than was once believed. A clue? Perhaps. What invention was your father working on when he was killed? My aunt said it was a new type of industrial guillotine. Isn't that one of the specialties of Paul Harmant's factories? It's what he built his fortune on in America. - What can we make for you? - A wedding dress. Oh, how exciting! You'll have the most beautiful dress of the century. Call Lucie. - No, not Lucia. - Why not Lucie? I thought you liked her a lot. That girl is unworthy of my trust. Lucie? You must be joking! She's the daughter of Jeanne Fortier. My father showed me proof. I don't want to see her again. I opened the eyes of the man who thought he loved her. He promised me that he would marry me. Is this where Mr Paul Harmant lives? I'd like to see Mr Lucien Labroue. - And you are...? - Miss Lucie. Miss Lucie? He's not in. Mama Lison! Oh, Mama Lison... My dear girl... whatever's happened? Lucien doesn't love me anymore. He wants to marry Mary Harmant. Mary Harmant? He refused to see me. Explain everything to me. Lucien doesn't want to marry you? He can't marry the daughter of the woman who murdered his father. I am the daughter of Jeanne Fortier. It's awful, isn't it? Lucie... Lucie, my little Lucie... Oh, Mama Lison. Lucky I have you. Yes my darling. I'm the daughter of a criminal. I have no right to live like others, because of my mother. My mother... I don't even know where she is now. She may suffering as much as me. Oh, Mama Lison... I'm so glad I have you. You won't leave me? No, my darling. Never. Never. - Is Counselor Darier in? - He's in a meeting. - You have an appointment? - No. - Announce me, will you. - As soon as his visitor leaves. I didn't know where to go... ...then I remembered what you had done for Lucien. You can prevent him from committing the most tragic mistake of his life... ...by not marrying Lucie because she's the daughter of Jeanne Fortier. It's very delicate, Madam. A lawyer does not intervene in someone's private life. A lawyer, maybe. But a friend? Certainly, I like Lucien very much, and Lucie seems very likeable. She's not responsible for her mother's past! It would be too cruel and unfair. You do not have the right to let that happen. It's true, it's unfair. I beg of you, counselor, do something. Find Lucien and explain to him. You'll find the words. Tell him... Tell him that Lucie is suffering as much... ...as her mother once suffered to lose her. Jeanne Fortier. What about Jeanne Fortier? I've seen her. Congratulations. You don't seem to understand... I've found Jeanne Fortier. Jeanne Fortier? - Bad time. - You said it. She see you? Not yet. But if she sees me, I'm lost, and you too. I didn't kill anyone, and burn down a factory. If I'm caught, I'll say that you're my accomplice. - Are you crazy? - Listen, Ovide. We only have one way of getting out of this... Make Jeanne Fortier disappear. This is a bad habit with you. This time, it's a necessity. She's known as "Mama Lison" and she's a bread-pedlar. Every day she passes under a painter's movable platform. Just cut the rope and the platform will crush her. Unseen, unknown. - Oh, the poor woman... - The platform. It's Mama Lison. What is meant to be, will be. Don't talk to me about it. Lucia has disappeared. With all the work I have, - Theses girls will be the death of me. - Disappeared? - Amanda looked everywhere for her. - Amanda? She's one of her friends. I'll call her. Amanda! Oh, you were there. I didn't know. Etienne Castel, an old friend of mine. He's also looking for Lucie. I've no idea why. Figure it out. Where do we start? Do you have an idea? I have a lot of ideas, Miss. You have such pretty eyes...! and I see you know how to use them. The first thing to do is to keep watch. But it's him... It's my baron. Oh gosh...! Bravo! You paid someone to act for me. Yes, cousin. - You didn't trust me? - I should have? You'll take me for a coward, but I have peace of mind. You make me laugh, with your conscience. You laugh at anything. The main thing is that Jeanne Fortier has been removed. It's over and done with. Go and see what they're saying where the bakers hang out. Since you're not able to do anything else... ...go along as a grass. - No, as a spy. - If you prefer. - There are words that bother me. I've always been sensitive. Still am. 'Le Figaro'! Get your 'Le Figaro', ...the paper of the elite the intellectual and the artistic. Are you going to a costume ball? Mum's the word! It's a women's story. So mum's the word. You don't sell Lantern anymore? It didn't sell. Too expensive for the plebs, and the toffs were afraid of it. So I put myself in the business. Le Figaro! Get your 'Le Figaro'! Oh, Mama Lison! - How are you? - I'm fine. I could do without this. You were very lucky. For once. That platform just fell! But her basket protected her. - You're lucky. - Who knows? See you tonight. We'll celebrate it here. All the bakery boys will celebrate. See you tonight.. At 8 o'clock at the Bakers' Hangout... "a dangerous criminal... Jeanne Fortier." It's not signed. What are we risking? You two go. Go to this celebration tonight and listen carefully. Only intervene if you really have to. Dress so as not to be noticed. - You there... - Sir? Scrap the mustaches. If I must. You too.. Miss. - You wish to dine, Ma'am? - Yes. We have the bakers' banquet table, but I don't think you... You're right.... I'd like a private room. If you'll follow me, Ma'am. I say, my treasure... - i have a proposition. - Already? - An honest one. - That'll be a novelty. There's a first time for everything. I want to play a prank on a friend. What did the baker ask you? He told me it was a joke for Mama Lison. The one who was almost killed? Yes. I have to put some drops into her chartreuse. What if we played an even better joke? How about a bit of quiet?! Since you insist... ...I'll interpret for you one of those melodious melodies... ...which constitute the most precious folk heritage... ...of our charming provinces. Nice speech! But first... ...I'll offer you a round of chartreuse...! ...to the health of our glorious survivor... ...Mama Lison. Here's to Mama Lison! Your health Mama Lison! Well how about that ditty, now? Silence! Silence! It's hot in here... The baker's man earns his crowns which hardly cost a penny The baker's man earns his crowns which hardly cost a penny - Where have they gone? - Where have they gone? - Well I don't flutter an eyelash - Well I don't flutter an eyelash An eyelash... Come on matey... Sing, matey! It's good to sing. And I'm not your mate. Would Ovide Soliveau, have a finger in the pie? No kidding. Ovide Soliveau, that good-for-nothing... ...has never been in trouble. I live on my income... ...thanks to my cousin, Paul Harmant the millionaire... ...who, in fact, is none other than Jacques Garaud. Paul Harmant is Jacques Garaud? Yes, mother. Paul Harmant is Jacques Garaud, the murderer of Alfortville. Sounds familiar to you. At 110 Rue de Rome. I can prove to you what I just said. - Jacques Garaud? - Yes, my pretty, Jacques Garaud. And don't bother being indignant... ...as I know very well who you are, thanks to the liqueur of truth... ...that I put in your glass. So tell all your good friends... ...that the admirable, the pure, Saint Lison... ...is none other than Jeanne Fortier... ...the escapee of Clermont Prison. We arrest them both? In the name of the law, I arrest you. We're the police! Rue de Rome. That's where he lives. - Your baron? - What baron? - His name's Ovide Soliveau. - Doesn't ring a bell. - Does "Jeanne Fortier" ring a bell? - Jeanne Fortier? Yes, She's Mama Lison. Mama Lison is Jeanne Fortier? - Yes. - I'm stunned Wait till you learn that Paul Harmant is Jacques Garaud, I did have my suspicions. - You're leaving? - Who are you? Arnold, don't you recognise me? Hello. How are you? Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Do you have a minute? It's not my fault, I didn't do anything. - I've had enough of this. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Arnold. Well I never...! Found something? Look at this. The death certificate of a certain "Paul Harmant". Extraordinary! Looking for something, Miss? I didn't know it was closed. I was looking for Mama Lison. You mean Jeanne Fortier? Mama Lison is Jeanne Fortier? You don't know about it? There were amazing goings-on here yesterday. Mama Lison... My mother! The police tried to arrest her, but she managed to get away. Piece by piece, the puzzle is coming together. The truth about Alfortville will become clear. When people get to see the whole picture... ...they won't be able to imagine the incredible story behind it. Sir, the men are here to take the painting. Come this way. That's it. - Watch what you're doing! - I didn't see it. Just be more careful. I'm sorry Georges, I know you wanted to keep it. It doesn't really matter. - The past is best left buried. - Are you sure? To think that this papier-mache toy was my childhood friend. I stuffed it with anything I found. The Trojan Horse was not stocked better. "Jacques Garaud"? - A letter of Jacques Garaud's. - Let me see. Oh, my God... "My dearest Jeanne..., Tomorrow I will be rich. "I will have an invention with incalculable benefits... "and nearly 200,000 francs to exploit it. "September 7, 1861." It's the letter believed to be burnt. Proof of the innocence of Jeanne Fortier. So Jeanne Fortier is innocent. How happy Lucie will be. But what was this letter doing in my toy? I believe, my dear Georges... ...that the time has come to tell you the truth. I was waiting until you were 25. But Providence has decided otherwise. You've been adopted by Clarisse Darier... ...but, in reality, you're the son of Jeanne Fortier. Mama Lison... She was there yesterday, standing in front of me and... Oh, Lucie! - Mr Darier... - My name's not Darier. My name is Georges Fortier. Yes, Lucie... I'm your brother. Georges! Lucien... Mummy! - Mary, get dressed, we're leaving. - Where to? Far away. I'm rather tired. I beg you... make an effort foe me. - What's happened? - I'll explain. But we have to go. No! You're not leaving, Garaud. Jeanne. Yes. Jeanne... Are you surprised to see me? Why did she call you Garaud? Who is she? Ask him, Miss. I beg you...! She's very ill. Have pity on my daughter. You had no pity for mine, or my son, or me! Today you have to pay. Father...? Don't listen to her. The woman's mad. Mad? Yes, I've been mad... Yes! Because of this man! But I've regained my sanity. I've been waiting for this minute for 20 years. 20 years of anguish, of pain, of shame. Father, make her leave! Don't ring! Don't call for anyone. - So explain to me. - Explain to her, Garaud. Explain to this unhappy child how you killed, burned... ...to fulfill your ambitions. How, on top of those crimes, you added another one... ...to have me condemned in your place. How you, Jacques Garaud, stole the name "Paul Harmant". - Shut up!. - No, madam. Please go on. How, because of you, my children were taken from me. How... Oh, my poor little one. How dare he throw you into Lucien's arms... The son of the one he murdered. No, you're not to believe her. Tell me you don't believe her! I should never have caused you this pain. I'm sorry. Extremely sorry. Fate wanted you to be here when I found him 20 years later. I pity you, Miss... ...with all my heart. We're alone, Jeanne. You've no proof of what you say. You're a criminal, escaped from prison. I can shoot you. No one will say anything. One more crime that you'll have to pay for. My God... Mary. Mary. My little girl. My little one... I've killed you. Nothing matters to me anymore. After all these years, I hate you even more. You'll suffer as much as I suffered. Guards, seize this man. I could have chosen another family. - That's fate for you. - Yes, that's fate. What is meant to be, will be. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
