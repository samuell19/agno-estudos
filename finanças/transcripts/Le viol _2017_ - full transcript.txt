The rape Damn it! - This one here. - No. - Yes, trust me. - OK. - Does it hold? - Yes. Yes. Open up, Mancini! - What is it? - Open up. - Bruno Mancini? - What's the matter? Get dressed. - What do you want from me? - Hurry up! What are you doing? What's going on? What did I do? At least give me my shoes. I can't go like this. - Please, damn it! - Shut up! Tell me what I did! OK, fine, take it easy! - Nice of you guys to wait for me. - We're hungry. Right! Enjoy your meal. Pierre Mathieu? - Yes. - You're coming with us. Police I'm Patrice Moreau. You wanted to see me. Have a seat. I'm going to check. I was getting in my car, and the Parisian guy said, "Tintin, let's go hit on some girls". - What Parisian guy? - Bruno Mancini. - That's because... - He's from Paris. We get it. And then? Before leaving, Bruno said, "Let's go see these girls on the beach". - And what did you say? - I said yes. I don't know them. I mean, I may have seen them, but... We all know each other here. But I never got in those girls' tent. We started messing around the tent, that's all. They got scared, but then they were OK. OK with what? Well, OK with talking to us. We weren't looking for sex. Was Mancini with you? Of course. Do you know the girls? I saw them once, a couple of days ago. They blew me off. They were naked when we got there. And they didn't mind us. I didn't fuck them. I just stroke them, kiss them. They say you beat and raped them several times. We didn't rape them, they wanted to! The brunette even gave me a wank. I wasn't there! - So your pals are lying? - Yes, but they're not my pals. - Why would they do that? - I don't know. Why did Nicole hit you? - Who's that? The blonde? - Yes. That was at first. She was scared. She hurt me. My head was bleeding. I got upset, so I responded. Meaning? I reacted to her blow. She started. And Mancini? I wasn't in that tent! I didn't fuck them. Why won't you listen? - OK, that's enough. - Easy! - Shut up. - Calm down. - You don't know them? - Not really. - Do you know him? - Well, yes. You weren't in the tent with them? No. Was he with you? Yes. Tell them, Bruno. We didn't do anything wrong. Do it, damn it! - He's right, I was there. - And? We hit on those girls and had sex with them. - You took your friends there? - Yes. They had rejected me. I wanted revenge. I asked Tintin and Pierrot to join me. - It was for fun. Right, guys? - Yes. You raped them because they rejected you? They consented. Then why did you say you weren't there? - I was scared. - Why? Because, I was scared. I denied it, I couldn't take it back. You wouldn't believe me. Put yourself in my place. I was afraid those girls would start talking nonsense. Wait here. You, get out. Out. Come on, get moving. Where to? You will appear before the investigating judge. What for? Come on! - Is the judge a woman? - Yes. My shoes? They didn't give me my shoes back. They say it's evidence. What do I look like? You look like an idiot. Go ahead and laugh. This is vile. Calm down! - Give me a cigarette, boss. - Later. Goddammit! Bruno Mancini. Like I said, Your Honor, the brunette really enjoyed it. She said I was gentle. She accepted your kisses? More than that! She even asked for more. We stayed on the beach a long time making love, while the blonde was with the others. Why would they press charges, then? I don't understand. They were consenting. In fact, when Tintin and Pierre left at around 3, the girls kissed them. You don't make up something like that. I stayed. I was alone with the girls. They could've ran away if they wanted to. Don't you think? For now, I'm just taking note of what you say. What about the blows? The bruises? That was at first, when they were scared. But that wasn't me, that was Pierre. Yes. I took Mr. Mathieu's statement. What about you? Did you hit them? Not in a million years! I don't hit women, Your Honor. But back to your question about the charges, I've my thoughts. Go ahead. At first, I tried to f... have sex with the blonde girl. But she was cold. And when I was with the brunette, she told me that she and the blonde were an item. They were dating! She said they were gay? Yes. You know... dykes! The blonde pressed charges because she was jealous. Of what? The fact that the brunette liked me. So this is about jealousy. It could be, right? Judge Di Marino's office, please? First floor, office number 3. You son of a bitch! What's wrong with you? You crazy chick! You need help! Where are you at? Ah, you're almost done. But this is not what I said. Yes, it is. I didn't change your words. I just summarized it. Alright, let's move on. Why are you pressing charges? Because it's not fair. Let Miss Leroy in, please. Tintin, Pierrot! Hey! Are you there? Mancini, to the visiting room! Thanks for the shoes. See that crap? - Are you OK? - I'm gonna see those girls. What for? They're nutcases. They'll tell you crazy stuff. Do you realize the shit you got yourself into? We didn't rape them. I already told the judge. The judge is a woman. Women support each other! They gotta drop the charges before it's too late. Stop worrying for nothing. It's not good for you. - Everything's gonna be OK. - Yeah, right. You don't have to worry. It's OK. Come on now. OK? Thanks. It's freezing in here. Don't make that face. You'll see me again. I won't stay long. Slow down, the flight's in an hour. They're gonna be released! - Hi, Dad. - Hello. My little princess. They dropped charges? No. I offered them money, but they refused. Your lawyer got you out. I'm happy to see you. Stop it, Dad. - Let's go. - Hold on. Wanna get a drink? - No, I'll pass. - No. We're out, we should celebrate. No, we're out of here. Fine, then. See you next time! Right. Goodbye, asshole! Brussels, six weeks later No! No! No! You have to, miss. We'll do a test to confirm, but I think you're pregnant. You can get dressed. Can you take it out right now? We'll wait for the results. No... No! Malia, are you there? Malia? Malia, I'm home. Malia. Talk to me. - What did he say? - It's growing in my belly. I can feel it. There's something dirty inside of me. I can't wash it out. Come here, sweetie. Come to me. Come to me, come. Come on. Can you read that again? Just the last part. The judge determined a premeditated act of violence which did not result in an incapacity for work of more than 8 days. So she doesn't think there was rape? Exactly. What does that mean, then? It means they'll be tried for assault and battery. As if they'd stole a bike or set a dumpster on fire? Sounds crazy, but yes. They'll be given... A few months of prison, with probation. That is, nothing. - It's not fair. - It's a man's world. What do we do? - What do you mean? - We were raped! We want them to be punished for what they did. We'll never make it to the criminal court. Why not? In the eyes of justice, you were victims of an offense. Not a crime. You mean they should've killed us? We didn't die. Stupid us, eh! We were just raped for five hours, but we didn't die. - We know it's hard. - No, you don't! This trial is the only chance we've got. We don't want this trial! You don't have a choice. Be reasonable. I was raped, I'm pregnant and you ask me to be reasonable? I won't be reasonable! Listen, go home now. Think about it, talk about it. We'll meet again, OK? And we'll see what we can do. Malia. What did you decide... about...? What do you think? As a lawyer, I must warn you. Abortion is still illegal. You may be prosecuted. Gynecologist Relax, it's going to be OK. I'll give you a shot so you can calm down. Abdominal, no preparation. What do we have here? Ages 19 and 24. - Alleged rape. - Let's take a look. - Light! - Slide to the bottom of the bed. Slide down. A bit more. Very well. Put your feet on the bar. Put your fists under your buttocks. Give me a finger cot. Hymen takes finger. You, go ahead! Where's your finger cot? Too late. You. Well? It takes the finger. It takes the finger. So... So, she's not a virgin. OK, next! Slide to the bottom. Slide some more. Put your feet on the bar. Your fists under your buttocks. Light. Relax. No lesions. It is impossible to determine if there was rape or voluntary intercourse. No evidence of anal forcing either. It's not that big a deal. - So, what do we have next? - Room 212, Mr. Marin. Yes, it was hard. It was painful yet again, but I'm so relieved now. You've no idea. I feel like I was cleaned out of that filth. What is it? No, it's OK. Sorry, it's not. It's the word "filth". It's disturbing. You could have used another word to talk about... About what? I'm sorry, you're right. What you went through... Spit it out, Jean-Pierre! You've a problem with words. What we "went through" was rape! And that rape produced filth. "Rape". There. Are you happy? Can we change the subject now? Why would we? We've been talking about this for weeks. You're on a loop. I'm sorry, but life goes on. We can't go on. That's quite obvious. Let's not spoil the evening. Come on. No, don't go. Malia, wait. It's just other people are suffering too. Mathilde lost her dad two weeks ago. Fred! I'm sorry, Mathilde. I'm sorry. You all knew? Yes. Why didn't you say? I told you, but you wouldn't listen. I'm sorry, Mathilde. It's OK. I think you should stop dwelling on this. Dwelling? How do you dare say that? I'm trying to help. Would you prefer us to be quiet? "Shut up and smile"? Stop being so aggressive! It's almost as if... As if you were holding on to this story. Let it go, damn it! Fuck. Wait. Excuse me. I want us to buy a gun. - What time? - 2 pm. It's them. Hello. Please, come in. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. She's the League of Women's Rights lawyer. She agreed to help. This is a big opportunity for us. - For you. - Hello. Colette de Marguerye, it is very nice to meet you. I believe we should... Let's go to the conference room. Of course. Come in. If you agree, we'll try to get the case transferred to the criminal court. That's exactly what we want. Perfect. There's something else, though. We believe that this should be a symbolic trial. Not only for your rape, but also for an entire society ruled by men. Your fight is every woman's fight. So in order to win, we will use the media. Are you ready to have your life exposed? To have the TV and newspapers pick up your story? I'm sorry, I know I'm shaking you up, but I need a quick answer. The first articles need to come out fast. If you don't feel up to it, we don't move. We let things take their course. Of course, it's up to them. But we've already started this fight. And it'll be hard to go back. The criminal court. Absolutely! You've no business in a regular court. Nicole, Mrs. Jacquemin wants to see you. I got letters from parents. Dear Madam, Please take heed of this letter and dismiss teacher Nicole Leroy. Want to keep reading? No. There's no point. You colleagues signed a petition. They want you to be transferred. Because I was raped or because I'm gay? Put yourself in my place, Nicole. I run a public institution. It would be better if you left. No. You're not making it any easier. No, I'm not. You can go. What's the matter? Someone's here. There. Did you hear that? They're looking for us. We can't stay here. They could've got a lower one. - What? - They could've got a lower one! And still, they're too close to the street. Look, it's fragile. - Are there many left? - Excuse me. - It needs more locks. - Shut up. Just saying. If it says "bedroom", it goes in the bedroom. Hey, mind your tone! - Where are the glasses? - Champagne! That's fragile. Why don't we go out instead? Yes. That's a good idea. What are you doing? Move over. - I'll make the bed. - Stop it. Stop. Did you like that girl? I can't. I just can't. Malia, Konings wants to see you. Malia, come here a second, please. I didn't say anything yesterday, but not every day. - Noon is noon. Not 12:30. - I'm sorry. OK, let me be clear with you. All I ask is for you to be on time and do your job. I know you have problems, but I won't be paying for it. It's true. No offense, but I'm not the one who raped you. Not to mention I let you work without a permit. - Speaking of, where you at? - I was denied it again. Damn. Even though... You'll be out of here once you get it. OK, back to work! When it happened to me, I didn't dare report it. I never told anyone. You're doing the right thing. I'm telling you, this is wrong. - She might be at the hotel. - I called them. They haven't seen her. - I'm scared, Isa. - Calm down, Nicole. Maybe she needs to be alone. - It's already dark. - Nicole! Go have some water. Go ahead. I'll be waiting. Are you there? Yes. - Feeling better? - No. I'll tell you something, and you're gonna listen. Staying together is not good for you. No, please. Not you. You gotta think about yourself. You must protect yourself. Malia's dragging you down. Don't you dare say that. Jean-Pierre is right. You turn it over together. You don't get it. Our strength is to be together. Move in with us. She's here. I gotta go. Where were you? I'm sorry, I needed to walk. Are you OK? I'm better now, yes. OK, so here it goes. Your jokes are so lame. There's a dyke, right. She's a bit of a slut too, you see. He knows that, so... He sings the Marseillaise, he turns the lights on... No. I like it. But it's going too fast. - Yes. - They gotta suffer some more. We start by shooting them in the knees. Oh, yes! The knees is good. Then we leave them in the sun for hours. And we shoot them in the balls. Already? And we let the bastards die slowly. Women can't keep shutting up. They don't dare speak because they feel guilty of their rape. Nicole and Malia are brave. They denounced their rapists, and are standing up against the justice of men. Malia, they're talking about you. Rape must be ruled a crime. Rapists should be tried in a criminal court. Thousands of us support Nicole and Malia. Because their rape is our rape. Their cry is our cry. Hey, honey! You're famous! Looks like you're doing better. You think? Yes, maybe. It feels good to be here. Breathing, getting some air. And also, there're all these women supporting us. It gives us strength. There's nonsense, though. Such as? "Every man is a potential rapist". That's not what I think of you. Thank you very much. May I tell you something? I'm expecting the worst. The guys who attacked you are pathetic lowlifes, that's for sure. But you're using middle-class justice to throw them in jail. - Are you kidding? - No. A criminal trial will ruin their lives. You, asshole! Our lives were ruined by them! Wait. We won't make it. They will appeal and it will be years before they are tried. I'm tired. Aren't you? Yes. You want to stop? What happened? Nothing. One year later Nicole! Nicole. - What? - Our lawyers called. The correctional court has no jurisdiction. The case is referred to the criminal court. And the men? They're appealing, as expected. So we start all over again? It's a first win. Yes. Yes. Who is Gisele Halimi? We can't change lawyers because you heard her. I already wrote her. Without telling me? She invites us to Paris. - She'll take our case. - We already got lawyers. We can't pay them. You think Halimi will defend us for free? - You're dreaming. - Yes! Malia, please, listen to me. Listen. In her answer, I feel that... we're not just a pretext to shake the system. She'll be with us, really with us. Not just with our case. She'll listen. But even then! Say everything again? Start over from scratch? I can't do it. Malia. I'd like us to meet her. Are you listening to what I say? It's overwhelming. Listen to this. "Let justice be done so we don't have to do it ourselves". "In this exemplary trial, our eyes are set on you". And this. "Would you be fine with a correctional trial "if the rape victim was your daughter or your wife?" Oh, my. Did you see the names? Jean Daniel. Delphine Seyrig. Colette Godard. Simone de Beauvoir. Madeleine Renaud. Jean Seberg. The smart set! Nothing to say. Halimi knows her job. Looks like we're not gonna have a choice. "The court of appeal has upheld the decision of the lower court - "The case of the Belgian tourists will be heard as a crime. "A victory for Gisele Halimi, who said tonight, "'We will win as long as the public opinion's on our side'. Go get some rest, Agnes. I'll see how they're doing. - I guess you weren't sleeping. - No. We're going to win this case. I'm sure about it. I know. It's been a long, painful wait, but now is the time. The next few days will be rough. But you should not be ashamed or afraid. Shame is not on our side. It's on theirs. Malia and Nicole, we are with you! We've got your back, girls! Rape no more My body is mine You're the lawyer. Were you in that tent? Get in line! Thank you for letting us through. Thank you. Here they come. Over here. Maitre, don't you think you may drag those three defendants into a too big of a trial? Maitre Halimi, please. Have you thought about the consequences for the families? Just one comment, Malia, please. Maitre Halimi, just one word. Criminal court Hello. What's up? Sorry to wake you up. My friend and I missed the bus. Since it's raining, maybe you could make some room for us. No. There's no room. Come on, we'll be good. Please. Here, take this. You can sleep outside, but not here. - Go away. - Please, it's raining. It's raining. We're good boys. Well? Was it raining? No, it wasn't raining, but the sea was rough. I told them I would defend myself with a hammer if they got in. If you come in, I'll hit you. No kidding! Bitch! - Shit! - Pierrot! Help! Shut the hell up or I'll bust your mug with this! Sir! Sir, please, help us. Hello, ladies! Where're you going? To see Pierre. You stay here. Hey, Pierre! Pierrot! - You OK? - That bitch hurt me. Go ahead and get even. - I'm out of here. - You can't chicken out. Two chicks, all alone. Have you got no balls? I was rejected by these two fat asses. It's not that. We're lesbians. We don't like boys. Hey! Did you hear that? Lesbians. Never fucked a dyke. Well, tonight, you're gonna like boys. We're gonna make you come. Can I have the brunette? Lie down. I'll give you two seconds. Do what I tell you! Or I'll cut you up and throw you in the sea. You want me to kill you? Fuck! There you go. Now you're gonna let me in. And he said I had to let him in. I was completely out of strength. I had no energy left to respond. Or to fight him or the others back. So they came in. And that was it. We spent five hours in anguish. I would still like some more details. Mancini laid on top of you. Was he naked? No, not at first. Then, he took his clothes off. Did he have full sexual intercourse? He penetrated me, but that was it. He said - because they were sharing each other's thoughts - that he wasn't there yet. He then allegedly asked you to masturbate and suck him off. No. Masturbate, yes, but I refused. Yes. You refused. That's what you told the investigating judge. Your version changes afterwards. Miss, could you please be more specific? At one point, he wanted to introduce his penis in my mouth. but he looked disdainful and disgusted, because my mouth was swollen, and I was bleeding. You said, "After a series of attempts, Mancini went to the other two, "and the other two came to me". What did they do to you? One of them took my hand and made me masturbate him. That's what you said. Didn't one of them try to sodomize you? Yes. But I can't remember which one. Moreau, the first one, came at me. And what did he do? He pushed me back and laid on top of me. And some time later, the oldest - I think Mathieu is his name - also laid on top of me. How? He pushed Moreau. They both tried to have intercourse. - Did they make it? - They penetrated. I know it hurt. Are you sure they both penetrated you? Mathieu and Moreau? I am sure that, at that moment, Moreau tried to. He grabbed me by the hair because I wouldn't open my mouth. He was grabbing me by the neck with one hand, and showing me his fist. Then, he opened my mouth. From then on, I couldn't do anything but give in. In your initial statements to the police, you repeatedly said that he had penetrated, but he had not gone all the way. That's what they were saying to each other. "I didn't come. "I didn't get off". They kept saying that. When did Mancini intervene, as far as you're concerned? Mancini came at me but I don't know when. Because the others had pulled away? They went to Nicole. And then Mancini had full intercourse. Meaning I was in pain. Yes. You made it clear he was brutal. I was in pain... And I had terrible nausea. When Moreau forced my mouth open, I had nausea all the time. You can go back to your seat. You just heard the statements of both victims. What do you have to say? This is a monstrous scheme. Careful! It's the first time you say that word. We've been obviously set up. You mean everything they've said about the attempted sex is inaccurate? I didn't have any sexual contact with them. The only thing is, after a long conversation, I asked the brunette, that's true, to perform oral sex on me. Because she said, "If you want to make love, be gentle because I'm in pain". I was like, "I'm no criminal. If you're in pain, "I don't make love". So we kept on talking. A moment later, she looked at me. She had a cigarette in her mouth, she said, "Just give a minute to smoke a cigarette". I was so surprised that I said, "You can smoke a pack if you want. I'm in no rush". And about 10 minutes later, she looked at me again and said, "Whenever you want". She stepped forward. I never grabbed her hair to force her, I never opened her mouth or threatened her or whatever. At which point, she gave me oral sex. One thing's for sure, though - I didn't reach orgasm. Maybe because I wasn't in the right mood. And that's it? That would be all? Three hours. We talked, Your Honor. You've got to understand. We didn't rape those girls. We never jumped on those girls. "After asking us to leave, "the two girls voluntarily accepted our invitation. "They were not subjected to any coercion". You stand by that statement? You need to understand something, Your Honor. They say that we didn't stop having sex with them for three hours. But we spent more than two out of those three hours talking to the girls. That's important. You can't stay hours on top of a woman. You think it's normal that they take you in, that they're seduced and willing to do certain things? You think that's normal behavior? And - may I add - considering they're lesbians? How do you explain it? I had three girls sleep with me once. We were two boys and three girls sleeping together. Why did they go to the police station and file a complaint, then? No satisfied girl would do that. Would she? "I just wanted to scare them". That's what you said. I assumed the guys would go and flirt. I wanted to stay with them. I expected them to do it. How were you going to scare them? That's not what I meant. Oh! What did you mean, then? Your Honor... This boy comes from a family of Italian immigrant workers. He can't speak well. I come from an immigrant family, too. I'm Spanish! So the plaintiffs can have issues, but not the defendant. Maitre, please. I will continue to read your statement: "We found both girls lying completely naked. "Mathieu wanted to touch the brunette. "At that moment, the blonde hit him with a hammer. "Pierrot got upset and said to the girl, "You're gonna pay for this". What did he mean? I don't know. "You're gonna pay for this". Funny way of quietly flirting with girls. No? Also on your statement: "From then on, they didn't say a thing, "and they were consenting. "Especially the younger one who said, "'Come to the beach with me'." Want to come? You remind me of a Spanish friend I had. And you kiss as well as he does. Get down. Look at my cock. You won't see many like that. - You stand by this statement? - Yes. "We were there until 3 or maybe 3:30 in the morning". Is that correct? Yes. Tintin and Pierrot left at 3 o'clock. How did they leave? How was their leaving? They said, "Shall we kiss?". "Let's kiss the French way". - Tell them what happened. - Twice? - Three times. - I said it. I was in no doubt they were going to kill us. I was sure they weren't gonna leave us alive. So when they decided to go, I was relieved and I said that so they wouldn't get violent. We were glad they were leaving. Before they left, did they try to get you to say you were consenting, in case you ever thought of pressing charges? The word "consenting". Mancini tried to... This is what you told the investigating judge: "From the moment I decided "to let myself go, my attitude was such "that it is possible that they misinterpreted the situation, "and thought our initial rejection had turned into consent". No, I never said that! The judge distorted our words. She treated us in a despicable way. We'd answer and she would say, "Is it yes or no?". And if we hesitated, she'd go, "I don't have all day". She was looking for the truth. It is normal to shake up the victims to find out more. Your Honor, I'd like you to listen to Miss Lopez's testimony. Go ahead. At one point, she asked me if I loved life. She asked me that. "Do you love life?" I was taken by surprise, so I replied, "So far, I do". But I never, ever said, "I preferred to be abused "rather than take a risk, however small". Those are not my words. No judge would invent such a statement. - You probably said it. - Your Honor, I'd like to add that Miss Lopez's report states that she had accepted, and that she'd taken an active part. See how important words are? I didn't take an active part. I was forced, I was threatened, I was beaten. I love you. - Again. - I love you. - Say, "I love you, Bruno". - I love you, Bruno. Oh, shit, it won't go in. Come to the water. You were forced to take an active part. "Forced", yes. So there was indeed "an active part". We never consented! As the brunette was making love, I invited her to the tent. I stayed until 5 am. The blonde was outside. She could have gone for help. Initially, you said you didn't want to go for help. It's not that I didn't "want" to. I had no strength, no choice. Meaning? I didn't want to leave Malia alone with this extremely violent guy. Why do you think they pressed charges? Those two girls live together. When I left, the blonde didn't want to say goodbye. I didn't understand why. Excuse me. You fucking whores! - Goddamn sluts! - What the hell is wrong with you? - You are out of your mind! - Beat it! Stupid bitch! You can't convict them of flirting! It's not their fault... Maitre Halimi. First of all, I would like to tell this court that we were insulted upon arrival. Me too, thanks to you. I would like to finish, Your Honor. We were insulted, one of my closest associates was slapped, another was spit in the face. The police did nothing. I was the target of obscenities that I shall not repeat. The atmosphere around this trial is deplorable. - But this is outrageous. - Yes. I'm the first to say it. But don't let it redound on these men. There they are! Guards! Remove those people. You point fingers at people and they're guilty? It's the circus of repression! Stop yelling. The incident is closed. Now sit down! Get out! May I say a word? Regarding? I want the court to take note that since the beginning, tracts have been distributed outside. And some women, when we go out, call the defense attorneys rapists. That, too, is the truth! - So, if you think... - Maitre Collard! That's enough now. Both sides were wrong, end of story. Right. So today, we are going to hear the witnesses called by the prosecution. The first witness is Professor Minkowsky. As a doctor, I have heard many victims of sexual assault. And I can say that the credibility, authenticity and veracity of the plaintiffs seem undeniable to me. Where did the defendants' rights go? - That is outrageous. - Don't shout! Do not shout! Credibility has no business here, sir. It'd be a prejudice. Just tell us what impact the rape had on the victims. I would like to say that rape is an insult to human dignity. And as a former resistant who was tortured, I can tell you that these women speak of their terrible, harrowing experience in the same way I did when I was tortured. That's what I wanted to say, Your Honor. Thank you, sir. I have a question for the witness. - Is it a specific question? - Yes, yes. Professor, please. What do you think about the rights of the defendants? What do you think of these three young men who claim to be innocent but might go to prison? You are concerned about human rights and that's good. I even share your concern. But what about the huge fuss that is being made around this trial, a fuss that seems to drag these three men into repression? Three schmucks, certainly. Three losers. It's true. But don't you feel you're part of a machine that will crush the lives of 3 men who, for the last for years, have claimed to be innocent. Are we at summation? This is a very important question. I'm here to defend three men. For better or for worse. We firmly believe they are innocent. And their innocence cannot be an insult to these young ladies. I'm done with the witness, Your Honor. - I would like to add something. - Go ahead. We've just been insulted, and mistreated... again. If you say they're innocent, that means we lied. You're wrong. OK, enough. Next witness, please. Ms. Arlette Laguiller. What do you know about the charges through direct knowledge, not through the press? I know that those young women, during one night, were humiliated, beaten and tortured. You know? I know because they told me. You don't care about repression? I'm not here to make a political statement. I've come to seek justice for Nicole and Malia. We're all here for that. I even got 150 telegrams to that effect. What if they're innocent? What does it mean to seek justice? It means that I ask you to take into account the defense of people as much as the defense of money, for instance. I am certain that... Stop right there, Madam. This isn't the place to discuss that. I'll only be a minute. If Nicole and Malia had been bank employees, and they had been kidnapped... Guard, remove the witness. Until they gave the keys to the safe, the people who are here today would have been convicted. I demand that those women who were tortured see justice done! Justice! This court is adjourned for 30 minutes. Oh no, it stopped. What time is it, Agnes? 2:50. There's the sluts' lawyer. Halimi! If you send them away, we'll kill you, bitch. - She thinks it's funny. - Idiot! What time do we resume? Maitre Halimi? You have the floor. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I think and I am sure the court has understood very well that in this case the debate revolves around the word "consent". Was there or was there not consent on the part of Nicole and Malia that horrible night? These two young ladies were sleeping when the assailants arrived at the scene. They figured out quickly what was going to happen. And that's the important thing. Did they fight back? Did they welcome - as may well have been their right - these three young people? Or did they say "no"? That night, these two women, make no mistake, feared for their lives. And these two fearing young women, who were shattered, defeated, beaten and humiliated, just stopped fighting. They gave in. Is that what you call "consent"? They gave in. And once defeated, they were subdued. Is that what you call "consent"? The problem that the court faces therefore lies in this question: Was there consent or not? Considering that the initial violence has been confirmed. It has been confirmed. And it's been proven. Punches, slaps, cracked lips, bleeding lips, bruises. Everything has been established and proven. It cannot be contested. As you know, in the days when the Gestapo tortured people, some Resistance fighters, heroes - and I do mean heroes - eventually talked. Who would dare to say that because they talked when tortured, they somehow gave their consent to their torturer, that they collaborated? Who'd dare? Who would say that when a form of violence like torture is used and an exhausted human being gives in, there is consent? I would like to point out how extremely important your ruling will be for the future. For Nicole and Malia... And also for the future. If you accept the thesis of the defense, saying there can be consent after such violence, do you know what you'd be doing? Well, you would be handing down a guilty verdict. You would be sentencing every raped woman to either die so they can prove to you that they fought till the end, or - if they survive - to go back to silence. Suppressed by rape, suppressed by suspicion, suppressed by society. Today, Nicole and Malia turn to you, to your justice. For them, for us women, so that a new way is born between men and women of relating to each other. Thank you, Maitre. The defense has the floor. Thank you, Your Honor. I'm sorry. If this is a rape trial. I'm sorry for being a man, if that's what being a man is. I'm sorry if this is a rape trial because... we all agree. But for them, those three boys, if you're expecting me to apologize, then no. No. You wanted a trial? You got your trial. Here you have three victims, not yet tried, perhaps innocent but already disgraced. I won't be an accessory to that. For four years, the defense was alone in this case. Completely alone. If it's any consolation, you're not the only one being taken to task. So, no. This isn't a rape trial. No. We are not here to do philosophy, morality or politics. We are gathered here today in this courtroom to try, all together, to render the best possible justice. Because to fully understand this case, we must not forget that in this trial something is masking its reality. The dimension it has taken nationwide because of a press campaign, because of the women's struggle has overshadowed the truth. And the truth is that, in this case, there is a cultural fact. Misunderstanding. In Port-Bon that night, two worlds collided. And this might explain a lot of things. These boys - you have them here, in front of you - met two independent young ladies. I am not in any way questioning women's freedom, but these ladies were very much liberated. Good for them. But ask yourself this: couldn't these boys have misunderstood the girls' attitude? Why do you think it was? The clash of two worlds. They are lesbians. It's not criticism, it's a fact. "I'm a lesbian", said Lopez. Again, that's her right. I'm not judging their lifestyle, but I wonder, and the defense must ask this question: were the boys able to understand this sexual liberation? They are nudists. Naturists. This is Leroy speaking, she said, "We are naturists". I'm not making it up, it's in the report. So my question is, This liberation, which we must acknowledge, did these people understand it? Was there not a misunderstanding between the two worlds? And I'm not the one who calls misunderstanding, who uses the verb "to misunderstand". I quote Miss Lopez again, it's in her report: "They may have misunderstood the situation, "thinking that our initial rejection "had turned into consent". And here is another quote from one of the plaintiffs, Ms. Lopez in this case: "Mathieu left with Moreau, "and after he kissed me, I was able to say, "Three kisses, Brussels-style. "I was so happy to see them go, "that I allowed myself this playful comment". "Playful comment!" Do these words, "playful comment", fit the reality of the trial that we are conducting? A trial where allegations of torture, beating, bestiality and cruelty have been made? Statements like this, which reflect a certain mood, make us wonder, are they really sweet little lambs that were eaten by the big bad wolf? The boys are here... because they didn't understand. Should they be punished? Should these men be punished today to exorcise women's fear? I ask for an acquittal. Thank you, Maitre. Defendants, please rise. Do you having anything else to add? Not guilty. I swear. I would never do something like that. Not guilty. You can sit down. The criminal court of Bouches-du-Rhone rules the following: Pierre Mathieu and Patrice Moreau have been found guilty of the attempted rape of Nicole Leroy and Malia Lopez. Bruno Mancini has been found guilty of the rape of Nicole Leroy and Malia Lopez. This court sentences Bruno Mancini to six years' imprisonment, Pierre Mathieu to four years' imprisonment, and Patrice Moreau to four years' imprisonment. You can take the convicts. Following this trial, a new law on rape was passed on December 23, 1980: "Any kind of sexual penetration "committed against another person by coercion or threat "constitutes rape". Today, only 10 % of raped women file a complaint. Subtitles: ECLAIR
