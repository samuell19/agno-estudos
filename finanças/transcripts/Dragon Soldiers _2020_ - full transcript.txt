- Billy? - Over here! Billy? - Is that you? - Shh, did you hear that? My God! No, it can't be. Shit. Fire. Fire! Now, fire everything! Kill it! Run! Come get some! Two more people gone already... just yesterday. I thought I had this thing under wraps after sweeping our little problem off the streets. Seems like it's going from bad to worse out there. They've gone from here to here... to who in the hell knows where. That's why you should always hire the best. Yeah, I'm learning that the hard way. Boldly. Boldly? Bold Eagles. Local militia just disappeared like everybody else. A whole militia? Intel says these vagrants are well armed and extremely dangerous. It will be dealt with, Eddy, if you have that 20% up front. I knew I could count on you. Your men aren't afraid of monsters, are they? What the hell are you talking about? Just some local legends about what really lives out in the forest... could be scary. My men don't believe in scary. My man. Intel suggests those vagrants may have migrated either north or east. Since when did towns call us in to defend them from their homeless? I think there's a little more to it than that. There's always something more, Artie. A couple of co-eds were last seen hiking along this... Hey! You present, Green? You want to tell me exactly what the mayor meant by monsters? It's local folklore. Scary stories the kids tell round the campfire. You're not telling me you're starting to believe in monsters, are you there, Julius? I believe in getting all available intel prior to taking on a mission. That's what I believe in. OK. Hey, Perce. Wanna turn that shit down? I gotta concentrate for a moment here. Hey, Artie. I'm busy. Oh, you readin' huh? There's some great articles in here. OK, what? Who's the knucklehead in front? It's Lance Hollis. Explosives. Served a tour under me in Afghanistan. Relax, he's good. I'm good. I'm good, man. I'm not sick. A little hungover. OK, look. We're in, we're out, we're paid. No time. It's a cakewalk. I don't like cake. Who the hell doesn't like cake, Julius? Alright, boys, what are we looking at? This is as far as the vehicles go. Need to hoof it from here, sir. Kayman, you good to go? Tracking, sir. Green, look like you just lost weight. Yeah, and you found it. Gents. Lance Hollis. Cover your mouth, grunt. Somebody's got bad breath they need to sleep off. I dunno if sleep's gonna work. This is the first I've seen him with his eyes open. Need to drain it, now's the time. You know... Hector Kayman there is the best sniper that I've ever seen. Bobby Tristan... is a weapons expert so good, he can sniff the air and let you know what ammo was used. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And Percy. Percy's here because he owns that beautiful machine that brought your ass here today. And clearly you can look at me and see why I'm here. Yeah. - Speaking of beautiful machines. - Exactly. But why you here, Hollis? Well, probably here cos of this. I hear you got some explosives in there? I got all the explosives in there. That booze I'm smelling better not be fresh. Got something. One o'clock. I got human remains here, over. Copy. Everyone move to Green's location, over. The hell's out there? Think our vagrants are cannibals? Not human. Has to be some kind of animal. Some big-ass animal. And it took some big-ass bites. Ya alright? Could be a mountain lion. Maybe a black bear. A black bear left a head in the cooler? That would have to be the biggest black bear. So? This way. You puke it all out, son? - Hope so. - Yeah, me too. Move out. Don't move. - What, are you gonna shoot me? - Sir, are you aware that the park and all the surrounding area is currently closed to the public? We need to get out of here right now. Gwen... is that fracking? No, that's on the other side of the mountain. Wait! Dammit. Where are you going? Gwen! You see he has a rifle, don't you? Ooh-wee! Anybody else catching that stink? Ugh, the smell. These idiots lose control of their campfire? Maybe they have flamethrowers. What are you thinking? Thinking about local folklore scary stories kids telling around the campfire before they burn down the forest and start taking huge bites out of people. So you think you can track 'em? Who you talking to? Listen up! Diamond formation. Five metre spread. Keep each other in sight. Area could be trapped or mined. Move out! Ryan! Don't move. Weapon. Jesus Christ. Weapon. Come on. Now. Hands up. Move. - Where? - Back there. I can't go back there. Move. You don't want to do this, lady. You are absolutely right. What are you so scared of? Bringing this big gun out here. I'm telling you, lady, we need to get gone. Stay right there. Ryan? I'm sorry. He's gone. - What's your name? - Griffin. Well, Griffin, I don't believe I told you to lower your arms. Look, lady, I'm not gonna hurt you any way, shape or form. I just wanna get out of here. So let's go. - Go where? - We're gonna go find him. Do you not see that blood? We can't be sure that's his blood. We don't know who it belongs to. Look, lady. It's Gwen and we're gonna find out what's going on out here. Can I have my gun back, Gwen? Do you actually know how to fire that thing? Yes. I fire it all the time. Let's go. What you got? Trail's dead. Just fly off into the air? Actually... Yeah. Don't beat yourself up there, Julius. You did your best. You haven't seen my best. Pick that trail back up. Kayman, come in. I read you, over. Got eyes on anything in the trees? Over. Negative. All clear up high... over. Wait, do you hear that? Hey, get... get down. Right, homos! You all just... No! I think I got something over here, guys. Percy, what you got? Over. You guys hearing this? Percy. Everyone, Percy's position now! Percy? Percy! Kayman, what you got? Over. I ain't seeing shit, sir. Over. Green, come in. Anyone else firing? Over. Heard it too. I'm headed to Percy's location, over. Where's Percy? Unknown. Any sign of Percy? Over. Hold position and keep looking, Kayman. - Over. - Copy, over. Starting to believe in monsters, sir? Green, report back. Over. I know this sounds strange, but... the trail just goes dead. Over. Copy. Kayman, eyes on anything? Over. Still negatory up here, over. Same thing as before. Trail just vanishes here. Looks like a couple of fracking rhinos fell here. Can you feel the wind? The wind is lifting the fog and blowing away the clouds which cover the moon! And he will command the beast and all of you all of you! You will die. All of you will die. Help me. You're gonna die too. You, all of you are gonna die. Now he's back at last and he will command the beast. And all of you! All of you will die. Breathe in the smoke of life. Breathe it in! I know you think Percy is... I never think anything, Hollis. What you got, Green? I mighta saw something. Details. I don't know, but... it sounded really big. Well, which is it? You see it or you hear it? Heard. Felt like it was coming from the tops of the trees. What now? Men... we have to accept the possibility that we may have seen the last of Percy Robertson. Green. We don't have a trail, but... my instincts are telling me that our enemy is retreating deeper into the forest as opposed to looking for a way out. Clear. These our guys? Former military. They stink. They're vagrants, Tristan. Yeah, but do you smell that? Same as when I found Percy. Don't move! Don't shoot. Who the hell are you? - Griffin. - You alone? Yeah. Where the hell are my goddamn pants? Mr Griffin, what are you doing out here? - Whoa! - Slow. Damn, dude. Y'all after those dirty hobos too, man? What do you know about the vagrants? What's a vagrant? What do you know about these men? They've got a lady park ranger hostage. Do not bullshit us. Man, I was with her. They got the jump on us. She ain't here now. Agh! Probably here right now... But we can follow the river down this way. Agh! Not down there, man. - Come again? - I've been out here for... for a while. Over that mountain, there's caves, ravines. That's where I'd be if I were a "vagrunt". Lead the way, Mr Griffin. Can I have my gun? Can I at least put my clothes back on? - You have one minute. - One minute... Are you serious? Is he serious? Oh, man! Give me back my shit. Picking up dead weight. Maybe we could use him as a decoy. Minute's up. Move it. Bums! Let's go, "high speed". Come on, man. Bring out the next sacrifice! So you think I'm lying to you? You'll soon see, yeah, you'll soon see. I want to sacrifice a skull for a bull. What do you want? Kick us out of town! We don't need you. What the hell? If it bleeds, we can kill it! Some kind of religious ritual or something. They're goddamn freaks, man. And soon... soon, the hunt will begin. Alright, boys. It'll be thunder formation. - Kayman, eyes. - Copy. You stay here. Unarmed? ...sacrifice, and we will command the beast and all of you, all of you... Alright, move out. Keep low. Whatever, bro. Are you ready? Always. Move out. What's your 20, Kayman? Over. In position, over. Damn! Have a knife day. All of you are going to die! You think I'm lying? And soon, soon the hunt will begin. Hear them! All of you are going to die! You're gonna die, too! All of you are going to die! All of you! And away we go. You! All of you are gonna die! Time for sacrifice is now. You owe me one. - What the hell was that? - What? You mean Kayman saving my ass? Watch your own ass. - Get to Kayman. - Alright, open the bag. No movement, over. Don't ever cook a grenade in front of me like that again. Clear that cave. How bad? 'Tis but a scratch. What, are you Shakespeare now? Target site cleared. Thanks for the cover, God. Over. My pleasure, over. Now get your ass down here and help with clean up. Over. On my way. Kayman, out. - More military. - All of 'em? I think so. You a soldier? Marine. Two tours in Iraq. Fallujah. Kayman, come in. What was that gunfire? Over. There's this big thing. There's a big, big, big thing out there that's gonna eat us. What is she talking about? - We have to get out of here... - Ma'am, listen to me. You need to remain calm. - Calm down. - W-w-we have to leave. Kayman, what is the situation up there? Over. Come in, Hector Kayman. Do you copy? This is Artie Cameron. Do you read? Over. What the hell's so funny? They didn't want us out there. They pushed us out here. But out here... Oh, we are provided for. Where are the other hostages? Sacrifices. - Psycho! - Stand down. Hey! Guys! What the hell is that moron doing? Gotta get out of here! Come in, Artie. Over. Cameron, over. Cave's clear at this point. Found a hostage. She's in a panicked state. She keeps talking about a monster. Holding for order, sir. Over. Green, hold. Kayman, come in. Over. Hector Kayman, report immediately. Over. Run! It's coming! Kayman, come in! Green, Hollis, my location. Now! Roger. You're not seriously going back out there? - Stay with her. - You sure? Fire! It's a goddamn dragon, bro! Cave! You came back for me? Oh... eh, well, you know. Stay here. Yeah, no problem, pal. Tristan, move! Move, come on! Come on! Go! What kind of bullshit mission is this, man? Kayman and I served in two goddamn wars together only to get his ass killed by a... dragon? Bobby, I need you here. Sir. Kayman and Percy were great men. And I swear to you, I am not losing another man today or civilians for that matter. Not on Artie Cameron's watch. - Hey, Artie. - Yeah. I'm on recon. Got your six. You're not going anywhere till you fix yourself up. What about you two? Do you require medical attention? I don't need shit. No. Need help? Oh, no, Miss. I, uh... I've done this a million times. Yeah, but you're... you're getting dirt in it so... take this off. - Bullets? - Yeah. In a sock? - Yeah. - Isn't that dangerous? Well, it looks like you guessed my middle name. Man, what do you... huh? I mean, did you see that thing? How could I miss it? Yeah, but... Come on, man. What the hell, right? Oh, I guess you see these flying, fire-breathing monsters every day, huh? Look, Hollis. I've learned to go into every situation expecting to see something I've never seen before. You know why? No. That way, the only time you'll see my ass surprised is when nothing happens. Yeah, and how often does that happen? Never has. So, you guys clearly aren't regular military. What's your deal? Was... Army. Twenty-two years. The mercs? Soldiers of Fortune, right? Like contractors? Yeah, like that. I'm thinking this is the work of the vagrants picking up after our dragon friend. Jesus. How many people do you think this thing has killed? What do you got down yours? Uh... possible way out, but... it's too narrow for that dragon to fit through. I got a dead end in about ten metres. So we'll just call that clear. Clear. So, you mercs got names or? Yeah. Artie Cameron, Tristan. It's all clear ahead, sir. Possible exit strategy. Too small for the enemy to come through. No light. Green, Hollis. Ma'am. So... what do you know about this dragon? Not much. He flies, breathes fire. Any idea where it come from? I have a hypothesis. The fracking on the other side of the mountain it collapsed a mine. Yeah, that's probably it. It's a mine dragon chasing black gold, right? The first two reported missing were the ones who were sent to inspect the damage. Where the hell did it come from then, huh, smart guy? I don't know. Do I look like a goddamn zookeeper? No. You look like a hillbilly. - You're the hillbilly. - Hey, come on. Listen, the more important question is how do we stop it? Alright. So what about those vagrants? What were they doing out there? Looks like they worshipped the damn thing like a god. I think that there's more to it than that. What do you mean? I don't know, I... I saw it blow some sort of smoke or gas on them. If you could've seen the way that they looked how they talked... it was almost like they were under... a spell or something. Funky voodoo magic, man? They were all vets. This is some bullshit. Your sleazy-ass mayor buddy got us out here killing our own. Julius, calm down. Mayor Mordry hired you? What do you know about him? I know that he kicked out all the homeless through some "clean up the streets" campaign. They have nowhere else to go so they come out to the forest. Look, it just made things a lot more complicated out here. Hey, streets are much safer thanks to Mayor Mordry. Yeah. How did you get out here? You know anything else about this thing? Yeah. It kills your friends. We're safe for now. Get some rest. Look, Hollis, I know you're new here. But Artie says you're the best at what you do. Well... I don't know about the best. I am good at what I do. You just better bring the bang, Boom-Boom. Please do not call me that. Sorry, Boom-Boom. You part of the team now. Literally no one else on this team has a nickname. Welcome aboard, Boom-Boom. Anybody else hear that? Yep. Fire in the hole! - Green! - This way! Move, move, move! You staying here? Wait. Where's Griffin? Where the hell did you dickheads go? Find us a way out. Now. Oh, come on. Help me up. One, two, three. Artie. What are you thinking? That it's time to put you to work, Boom-Boom. Alright. Bold Eagles forever. On your feet, Hillbilly. Hey, man. Sorry I called you "Hillbilly". Even though you just called me one again. Yeah, shut up! Come on, Hollis. Almost there. Tristan, move it! Move, move, move. Good to go. - Move! - Better be. Move! Come on, come on. Move, boys! Go, Artie, go. Not on your life. Almost there. Come on, Artie. Artie, let's go. Artie... I'm not going anywhere. But you are. Give me the launcher! Go. Alright, shithead. Eat this. I didn't... I didn't blow it, I swear. Where's Artie? Blew his ass to hell, man. Artie's gone. And I know we all... What are we gonna do? We're exposed here. To what? Dragon's dead, right? We also no longer have a map for this region which leaves you, Ms Peters as our most knowledgeable asset on this land. Hey. OK. Alright, there's a ranger station not too far from here. Um, our best bet would be to follow the draw up to the plateau. Leads right to the forest. We move now. Yeah, sure. OK. Um, this way. We're Oscar Mike. Wait... we're not resting? Guys, seriously. You can't take a... five... five minutes max? Gotta be kidding me! Double time. I tell you what... When this is all over... I'm gonna take a long-ass vacation. Yeah, I heard that. - Cancun? - Nah. Tahiti? I ever tell you about Mikey May, Tristan? Mikey May was my best friend from as early as I even knew what a best friend was. You see, we grew up together. We went to school together. We played football, we served together. We cleared buildings door to door in Baghdad together. Defended Kamdesh against the Taliban together. And the whole time, no matter what we was doing or what was going on Mikey would never stop talking about Tahiti. Apparently, he went once with his parents on vacation when he was like, I don't know, 12. And from that day on, he would talk about nothing else. Didn't matter where we deployed. Even some of the places that wasn't hazard pay or complete shitholes, they were never good enough. They were never Tahiti. When he got out of the service he moved there and opened a bar and, uh... I haven't seen him since. Because of Mikey May I've wanted to go to Tahiti my whole life. I figured, hell, maybe after a few more jobs I'll go pay him a visit, see what all the fuss was about. One day, I told myself. One day, I'd go see Mikey in Tahiti. But now... I don't give a damn if I ever see Tahiti cos I will spend every day I got left every breath slaying that dragon even if I have to carve that motherfucker from the inside out. Fuckin' A, let's do this. That's a negative. Hollis, Tristan, you are to escort these citizens safely back to town. Take them back? Look... Artie brought us here together and when he went down, this became my team. Now, he made a promise there would be no more losses and I intend to keep his word. He didn't mean that you were supposed to take this on. I don't want to hear it, Hollis. Now, I've already come to terms with it. I will stay until the job's done see this mission through. Now, we've all been through a lot together but this is where your part of the journey ends. But I can assure you one damn thing. I will slay that scaly son of a bitch. - Julius. - That's an order, Tristan. You and Hollis are to take Miss Peters and Mr Griffin back to town and you are to leave now! This is bullshit. That bastard killed my best friend. I'm not going home while that thing's still flying around shitting fire. You've been running away from this thing as long as I've known you. OK, yeah. I been running... cos it's a goddamn dragon! I'm still out here cos... because I lost people too. You don't let anybody get away with that not even a dumbass lizard. Look, Hillbilly's right. Look, I feel you guys. I don't care how much of a badass you think you are, sir. But if you actually intend to kill that thing you're gonna need more than your two strong arms. Look, there's no rank out here. The man paying us has passed. I mean, we're nothing but a bunch of dirtbag civilians now. You can't make us do shit, sir. I was just thinking... instead of your lonesome ass running around out here like a piece of meat waiting to be barbequed... you could accept some help for once. There's a lake not too far from here. There's been a lot of avalanches this year. With Boom-Boom's help, we could trigger one. Trap that beast. Bury it in the lake. Not even a dragon can survive that. I'm on board. Hell yeah, that could work. Sort of like water beats fire, huh? Alright, I'm in. But we need to move and we need to move fast. I don't know how much time we have. So what are you thinking? I'm thinking we set some traps. Y'all have dragon traps? Snares, here. Why don't we just feed it this dude's bombs and blow its ass up? What are you gonna do? You gonna walk up - and hand feed it? - No, he just eats the bag and then you shoot the bag and boom! C4 does not explode when you shoot it. Doesn't it? There, right on that ridge that's where you want to put your C4. Yeah, yeah. You got this, brother. Alright, Boom-Boom. Time to shine. We need you up there doing what you do. Now, once we lower the dragon in position that's when you bring the mountain down on his scaly ass. Can do. Tristan, 550 cords and tripwires. Roger. OK. - It's on like Donkey Kong. - On it. Gwen, foliage and cover. You really think all this "Predator" shit's gonna work? Instead of complaining, maybe you should help. Alright. She's good to go. Over. Copy that. Now bring your ass down. Target is en route. Hello. Good... Good dragon. Come on, dragon. OK. Just a little bit more. Just a little bit more. Good dragon, come on. No, no. No, no, no. It's OK. Engage! Come on, come on! Hollis, keep that trigger finger ready. Copy that! Gwen. You OK? Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Sacrifices must be made. Bold Eagles, baby! Come on. Hollis. Shut up, man. Not right now. Did Green ever tell you his story about the surprises? Yeah, he did. Yeah, well, he's full of shit, man. Well, hang on... I think we all were. Hold that. Hold that right there. You OK, Gwen? Hollis, I'ma try to lead it back your way! Get ready! Do you read me? Over. Gwen, this ain't fair! I don't wanna hit a woman! What happened? Uh, long story. Did you shoot me? Look, a dragon! Come on. Lay down, lay down. Green, I'm with Tristan. He is hit, but he is OK. Over. Julius, are you on this line? Anybody on this line? Come in, over. Come in, Goddammit! Hold that, alright? Yeah. OK. I'll be right back. I'm not going anywhere. Fuck. Blow it! Close enough for government work. Wait! Griffin! You OK, bro? Hey, what the hell are you doing? Revenge. Bold Eagles forever, baby! W-w-what are you looking for? - The detonator! - Detonator, OK... Where-where is it? Hey, fire fart! Come and get me! You ain't shit! No, I don't see it! Did it fall? I don't know. It's somewhere around here. You looking for this? I'm gonna throw a perfect strike right up your ass. Fire in your hole. Must be out of range. - The hell? - What? It's gotta be higher and closer. Just gimme the damn thing. Alright, look, code is set. Just pull the trigger. Shit. Why ain't this thing working, Boom-Boom? Fall back. There's no blasting caps. - He can't blow it? - Green, get back here! You know what? Fuck it. Come get some. No way. That's it. Show me some magic, Puff. Hell yeah! Ow. Oh, Green, that was glorious! Great shot, great shot. Green, are you there? Over. I'm here. I think I got him. - Yeah, buddy, you got him. - He's alive? I guess you were wrong about C4 being detonated by a bullet, huh? Well, that's cos I got a lot more than C4 in that bag. Grenades, claymores. That doesn't sound safe. And that's why we call you Boom-Boom. Hate to break up the positive vibes but I'd love to not spend another night in this forest. It's scary. OK. You kept your promise, Artie. You kept your promise. Well, I appreciate the party's support and I look forward to... What the hell? Blue Falcon. What? Where's Artie Cameron? Artie's dead, you son of a bitch! And so are Percy Robertson, Hector Kayman and countless other vets you sent us out to slaughter! Whoa, whoa! You're a goddamn disgrace. You better hope I never have a reason to come back here. Pogue. I know he would be proud of you guys. Of all of us. - Hillbilly, too. - Yeah. That's the truth. Alright. So, if dragons are real does that mean that there's other monsters out there? Don't know. And right now, I'ma be honest with you, Hollis. I don't give a shit. OK. Let's get outta here. Oh, hey, what's up, bro? Bet you're wondering how the hell I'm still alive, huh? I'll tell you. I'm alive... cos I'm the smartest, most badass hero this world has ever seen. That dumbass dragon, he's so stupid he didn't chew me or nothing, man. So as soon as I got in there, I dropped the explosives and I made a beeline to his B-hole. And here I am, alive. Covered in dragon shit. So I'm gonna go wash off. Shut up, squirrel! You weren't even there.
