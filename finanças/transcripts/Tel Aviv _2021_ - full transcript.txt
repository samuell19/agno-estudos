Five days. ﻿We'll probably know by then. ﻿Judging by the date of your last period. ﻿expected to see ﻿a more significant development. ﻿A yolk sac. at least. ﻿But perhaps there's been a miscalculation. ﻿I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. ﻿What are we supposed to do now? ﻿What are we supposed to do? ﻿Just wait. ﻿Five days isn't that long. ﻿ease make an appointment with Dina for Sunda ﻿and until then. I say... Don't overthink it. ﻿Just take a deep breath. ﻿and go on as usual. DAY 1 ﻿This, too. ﻿You wanna watch something together? ﻿There's nothing to watch. ﻿We never watch anything together anymore. ﻿Shocking. ﻿"We don't watch anything anymore". ﻿What's your deal ﻿That's what's bothering you? ﻿That we don't watch anything together? ﻿But wasting every night slumped on this couch, that's fine by you? ﻿Why? We go out. ﻿Yeah, right... ﻿My grandma's social life is better than ours. ﻿Why do you insist on living in central Tel Aviv If all you do all day ﻿is jerk off in front of the computer? ﻿Jerk off. Really. ﻿Really. ﻿What you do there all day? -It's called "Work". ﻿Right. ﻿OK. listen. I understand you're in a bad mood, but do me a favor, lay off me please. ﻿It's not even about that. -You're not going through this alone. ﻿This is not a recent thing. ﻿I think that when people turn thirty. ﻿they change a little. They like to stay in. ﻿Their temperament relaxes a little. ﻿I could slap you right now. ﻿You think I enjoy staying in? ﻿In this disgusting apartment? ﻿OK. I don't have time for this shit. ﻿What ﻿Back to your computer ﻿Yes. but you can go back to your bag of chips. ﻿Looks like you've really got something going there ﻿OK. ﻿Fine. ﻿Come and sit with me already. ﻿Well? ﻿Come on. don't be so sensitive! ﻿Come here. ﻿Come here. ﻿We could look for a place near my mom's. ﻿We're going to need a lot of help now. ﻿Yeah, like I'm going to move to that shit hole where your mom lives. ﻿So what do you suggest? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I think I'm going to go out. ﻿Out where? ﻿It's after ten. ﻿Really? After ten. is it? ﻿And on a school night! ﻿Very funny. ﻿What's so funny? I don't know... ﻿People go out. ﻿OK. but where to? ﻿What are you going to do? ﻿Just walk around? ﻿Do you wanna come ﻿No. I... ﻿I have to get up early tomorrow. My eyes hurt. I don't want to. ﻿Be spontaneous. I'll buy you a chaser. ﻿Forget it. I'd only suffer. ﻿Fine. I'm locking you in. ﻿Bye. Babe. ﻿Bye. Babe. ﻿Good night. ﻿How's it going? ﻿Dana, right? ﻿Right. ﻿Didn't we go to university together? ﻿The theater department. ﻿Right. ﻿Weren't you one of Edna's favorites? The ones she didn't curse out as much. ﻿Right. ﻿We were scene partners once. ﻿"The School for Wives". ﻿Me and you? ﻿You don't say. ﻿Weird. I forgot all about that. ﻿So are you like... an actress now? ﻿I studied directing. ﻿but... ﻿I dunno. ﻿I'm not so attracted to the theater anymore. A bit repulsed by it. even. ﻿Is it that bad? ﻿Yeah, all that pathos and self-importance... ﻿Who needs it? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿I'm a project manager at Vision Tech. ﻿We produce events. ﻿It's pretty cool. -I meant, what are you doing right now? ﻿Wanna do something? ﻿What do you suggest? ﻿I don't know. We could... ﻿go to my place. ﻿Is there a trash can around here? ﻿There's no trash can. ﻿Wow. ﻿So what do you say? ﻿Can I kiss you? ﻿Stop. ﻿Stop. Dana... ﻿Stop it. Babe. ﻿Honey, stop. ﻿I have to get up early tomorrow. Stop, please. ﻿I don't care. ﻿Come on. stop it. ﻿What's this? ﻿Have you been drinking? ﻿Are you completely insane? ﻿You're supposed to be pregnant! ﻿It was just one beer. Big deal. ﻿Stop... ﻿Stop. You stink! Stop it! ﻿You... ﻿Fuck me. -Dana, please... Stop. ﻿Stop already! ﻿Enough ﻿You're nuts ﻿DAY 2 ﻿- I had a really great time last night - ﻿Hello. ﻿Hi! ﻿Hi. ﻿Hi. Well... -Hello. ﻿You're hot. Poor guy. ﻿Shall we go in. to the AC? -No... ﻿I'm OK. thanks. I'm.. -Are you sure? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Thanks for agreeing to meet me like this. ﻿You've got a show tonight. -Oh. sure. ﻿I've got a show every, night. -Yeah. I'll bet. ﻿Listen. ﻿﻿I'm very intrigued. ﻿The repertory theaters wouldn't touch his kind of play with a ten-foot pole, you know. ﻿Is that good or bad? ﻿It's good, obviously. ﻿I'm just not sure what target audience you're aiming for. ﻿Audiences are tricky nowadays. ﻿And it's a complicated text. ﻿Listen. I love complicated texts. -Right. ﻿This isn’t a first for me. -Right. ﻿I wanted to make that clear. ﻿Right, you directed a Nissim Aloni play. But this is different. ﻿This... You wrote this. ﻿No... ﻿It's based on a book by this German sociologist. ﻿Oh. a German sociologist... -Yeah. Georg Simmel. ﻿Georg dimmer? Oh. well... That changes everything. ﻿Then it's sure to be a hit. ﻿OK... ﻿Listen, what can I do? I believe in it. I... ﻿I really think it's the most personal thing I've ever done. For real. ﻿I just got this urge to talk about the city. ﻿out... Listen. I've been living here since I was 1 and I don't feel like it's my home. ﻿I don't feel like it's my city. I... ﻿feel like a stranger, like... ﻿The city is driving me away. ﻿I dunno. I'm starting to really hate it. ﻿And still. I'm not moving away. I'm staying here. ﻿Go figure. ﻿You probably shouldn't go into the politics, by the way. ﻿You'd be shooting yourself in the foot, in my opinion. ﻿I'm all for it. of course. ﻿Thank you. -Just so we're clear. ﻿So you've started rehearsing? ﻿I wouldn't call what we're doing right now "rehearsals". ﻿I call it workshopping. ﻿We’re formulating the language, we're... ﻿I'm not committing to any big organic move yet. ﻿And yeah, a few days ago already. ﻿I realized I needed an actor. ﻿a central figure. ﻿a big part. ﻿to build the whole piece around, you know? ﻿We're doing a run through five o'clock Saturday, if... ﻿you'd like to come. ﻿So weird... ﻿What's that? -No one's come over. ﻿No one's even noticed you joined me. Would you like something? ﻿Maybe a coffee, if you... -A coffee. ﻿What is it with this pretentious place? God! ﻿It's OK. it... doesn't matter. ﻿If I didn't live right next door. I'd... -Listen... So what do you say? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Listen. ﻿when a theater director approaches me... ﻿I'm talking about the repertory theater, yeah? ﻿I can understand what his motivation is. ﻿Yeah... ﻿He wants to make a career there. He... ﻿He's looking for that honorarium. ﻿He knows that the theater will pay for stagehands to construct his sets. ﻿That. I get. ﻿Perhaps his dream is to. one day. ﻿manage a theater. Get a higher salary. ﻿To reach the top. -Yeah. ﻿That. I can understand. -Right. ﻿What you're doing... ﻿I don't get it. I admire it. but I don't get it. ﻿But I'm glad that there are people like you. ﻿romantic types, who make art for art's sake. But... ﻿How old are you? ﻿Thirty-one. ﻿Married? Kids? -Married, yeah. ﻿Right. Now. that... ﻿At that age. it's not so cute anymore. I think. ﻿It's even a little.. ﻿Off-putting. Pathetic, even. ﻿Forgive me. it's nothing personal. I'm all for it. ﻿I really want to to do something like that. ﻿You know, something with no money. ﻿So I say to her. ﻿"What about the libido, though? ﻿"Where's the libido in this?" -And what did she say? ﻿What could she say? It's Dana. ﻿She can't even move a millimeter for herself, so how can you expect that for me... ﻿But what does that mean? I don't understand. ﻿What does that mean? You don't understand? ﻿For instance, that she's been putting off completing her degree for a million years already ﻿Every week she says to me. ﻿"This week. I will finally finish my final paper. ﻿"I'll finish the paper this week. I promise you. I swear. ﻿"I'm printing it up", she says. ﻿Now. the crazy thing is that she actually believes it. ﻿Like, she's convinced she's right. ﻿She's in total denial. Insane. -Right. ﻿And I have to constantly be with her. have my eye on her. ﻿make sure that she stays on track, that she doesn't go off the rails. ﻿I constantly have to be around her. Just her. yeah? With my ears open... ﻿﻿I'm just like... her guard dog. ﻿I can't get any sleep, any rest. It's crazy. ﻿I don't get it. though. What do you think would happen if you let go? ﻿What's the worst that could happen ﻿The whole house would collapse, if I let go. ﻿The ceiling would cave in. ﻿The walls would fall down. the... ﻿Forget it. Honestly. I'm telling you. I'm afraid of what would happen. ﻿But you love her. don't you? You love her. ﻿I know you love her. -Yeah... ﻿Do I love her... ﻿And what does it mean that they still don't know? ﻿They just... don't know. ﻿They just don't... Sometimes they don't know. ﻿And if it doesn't? ﻿I don't really know. ﻿I think that... ﻿it dies. ﻿before.. ﻿either, before the birth, it's stillborn. ﻿or they take it out... I honestly don't know. ﻿How's Dana taking it? ﻿She's in denial, of course. It's Dana. Dana is Dana. ﻿I don't know how a person could deal with this. ﻿It just seems,.. Wow. ﻿Because you're a sweetie. ﻿Yeah? -And I love you. ﻿Yeah? ﻿Yes. -Great. ﻿Maybe you could be my boyfriend? ﻿You understand me. ﻿But what about the libido? ﻿Huh? What about the libido? ﻿We never fuck anymore anyway. What difference would it make? ﻿What's going on? ﻿OK. never mind. You're not into it. you're not... ﻿You're not even into it. ﻿I'm totally into it! ﻿﻿I'm sick of you. ﻿Could you turn the light off? ﻿I was totally into it. ﻿DAY 3 ﻿We look so uncool with these bags. ﻿What do you want me to do? -We should've gone to the bar first. ﻿But then, by the time we'd have left the bar. the market would be sold out. ﻿We look pretty awful. ﻿OK. I don't get it. What... ﻿I don't know what you want from me. ﻿I want to be loved. Here, in front of everyone? ﻿On the table? ﻿I met with Yaron last night. ﻿He says hi.-by the way. ﻿And I think I had a real.. ﻿Like, an interesting observation. I realized,that there are two kinds of people in Tel Aviv. Right? ﻿There's people with money. ﻿Old money, people who work in tech. whatever. People who can afford... ﻿You know? To live in Tel Aviv. ﻿That's the first kind. The second kind is these kids from the sticks. ﻿who come to Tel Aviv all doe-eyed, and live in shitty hovels with Wi-Fi. ﻿And they just... They have a dream, you know? ﻿They're dreamers who would never leave Tel Aviv. That's the second kind. ﻿Now if you don't belong to one of those two groups. ﻿Tel Aviv spits you out. ﻿Drives you out. You fall through the cracks. ﻿like a transplanted organ that's rejected by the body. ﻿That's it. ﻿You look so ugly when you speechify like that. ﻿OK. so Pet's just... I'll never talk to you again. ﻿and that way. you won't have to look at my face. ﻿Stop it. You know I say it with love. ﻿You can be such a bitch sometimes... ﻿I was just saying! -I'm pretty sick... I'm very sick of it. ﻿Oh really. ﻿Yes. ﻿You'd better hope you're really pregnant. ﻿Or else what? ﻿You'll leave me ﻿I'd leave you so fast your head would spin. ﻿I'd run away. -I dare you. You'll see. ﻿Shall we take a cab home? ﻿How much money can you spend in one day? ﻿Oh shut up. you cheap bastard. ﻿Finally! ﻿You see? It's not that far away. ﻿You have no idea. The bus ride was a nightmare. ﻿It took over an hour and a half. -What?! ﻿An hour and a half? That's like going to Jerusalem ﻿Jerusalem would've been quicker. Traffic near Azrieli is always a nightmare. ﻿Oh. I didn't know you were coming. ﻿Hi. what's up? ﻿Fuck! These fucking people... ﻿That's what you come to Mom's for? To watch soccer? ﻿Hi. ﻿Hey! -How are you? ﻿Sweetie ﻿What's up? ﻿Try not to get her wet. ﻿Wait. ﻿didn't you guys have a test? ﻿David, if they have news, they'll tell you. Give them some space. ﻿Who's not giving them space? ﻿All right. Are you hungry ﻿I brought some laundry. I left it over there. ﻿Laundry? Again? ﻿Why don't you get a machine already? ﻿After the baby's born, you have to have a machine. ﻿Fine. We don't have room for it in our apartment. ﻿Maybe we'll get one after we move. ﻿Have you started looking? ﻿Make sure it's in this neighborhood. ﻿We haven't decided anything yet. OK? ﻿But you're going to need help. There's no way I'm commuting to Tel Aviv. ﻿You know what the traffic is like. -Yes. we know what the traffic is like. ﻿Mom. -What? ﻿I'm getting hungry. -So come to the table. ﻿How about not drawing so much attention? ﻿What's the matte ﻿Don't be such a pig. that's all. ﻿Oh. stop it. I'm in my own home. I'm not trying to show off. ﻿Good job. David. You're absolutely right. ﻿Well, you guys did have a test, didn't you? ﻿Yes. We had a test. ﻿We have to go back on Sunday for the final results. ﻿What does that mean? Where's the results? ﻿Wasn't the doctor in? ﻿The doctor was in. We just have to wait a few days and see how it develops. ﻿Is something the matter? -It's fine. ﻿Really, there's nothing wrong. ﻿We're very happy with Dr. Kissinger. Right? ﻿We'll do another little test on Sunday, and then we'll have a better idea. ﻿Besides, the soup is excellent. ﻿Thanks. Dana dear. ﻿Lucky you're here. ﻿If I had to rely on these two dopes. ﻿I'd never hear a compliment. -Oh. come on. Mom... ﻿What about your theater show? ﻿Oh good, you're up. Which show? ﻿You know, the one you've been working on. ﻿I've been working on several things. ﻿Come on.. ﻿The one with that hot chick. ﻿You know, from the bubble gum commercial. ﻿Oh. "Urbanism". ﻿Oh. right. ﻿"Urbanism". ﻿With an exclamation point, right? ﻿Yes. it's "Urbanism" with an exclamation point. ﻿Right, so it's... ﻿Urbanism! ﻿Or perhaps you prefer... ﻿"Urbanism!!!" ﻿Wow. Hysterical. So funny. ﻿How long have you been working on it? ﻿Not exactly working on it... ﻿We're formulating the language. ﻿﻿I'm probably going to incorporate another actor. ﻿But it's been six months. ﻿You started six months ago. right? ﻿But when will it open? -Why? I mean... ﻿No reason. Just taking an interest. ﻿not giving you Yael's phone number. ﻿Who asked for her phone number? ﻿She's on Facebook, isn't she? ﻿Listen, please don't embarrass me about that. ﻿What? How could your brother embarrass you? ﻿He's the biggest sweetheart ever. ﻿My brother is the kind of sweetheart who would send a girl a dick pic ﻿thinking it would turn her on. -What? ﻿I didn't understand a word of that. ﻿You don't understand. It's just that... ﻿Michael's sort of in love with this Yael. He's... ﻿very concerned about her wellbeing. ﻿That explains a lot. ﻿Don't you have some lame Ono College party to go to? ﻿What's wrong with Ono College? ﻿Wait, are you saying that me going to college and learning a real profession ﻿isn't up to your standards? -What have you got against his college? ﻿The fact that I. unlike you. ﻿won't be needing a bank transfer from Mom the first of every month... ﻿It really bugs you. huh? -Stop it. David. ﻿Stop it. That's no way to talk. ﻿Why so serious, all of a sudden What's the matter? ﻿You think I got serious? ﻿I'm just bored, so I'm busting your chops. ﻿Making fun of snobs like you is fun. ﻿Can we move on to the main course? ﻿I want to get up early tomorrow. I've got a rehearsal. ﻿On a Saturday? ﻿Yes. Don't worry. I'll say my morning prayers first. ﻿Oh. for Pete's sake. ﻿Oh. I left my lipstick upstairs. Hang on a minute. OK? ﻿Great. ﻿She's cute, your wife. ﻿For your sake. I hope you don't masturbate to her. you perv. ﻿My masturbation is an autonomous zone. My fantasies are none of your business. ﻿Don't even. Don't even. ﻿Have you been to Dad's recently? ﻿Of course. I see him every week. ﻿And...? What's new with him? Still out of it? ﻿Still talks about Mom all the time. ﻿Keeps asking about her. if she's with someone... ﻿Waxes nostalgic. ﻿And not a word about how she emasculates him. ﻿﻿In denial, as usual . ﻿Any news about... ﻿about his work? He was all stressed out about it last time I was there. ﻿He's on borrowed time there. And when you're over 50. ﻿you're easy pickings. ﻿I think.. ﻿he's gonna get axed for sure. ﻿The only reason they haven't is the severance they'd have to pay. ﻿He's been working there for. like. 25 years. ﻿It's very worrying. ﻿I really want to help him. but I don't know how to help him. ﻿say the best way we can help our parents is to not... ﻿not need them. ﻿Financially. I mean. ﻿To be independent. ﻿Thanks a lot. ﻿You know, it doesn't really matter. ﻿They'll always respect you more. ﻿Even if they say you were stupid for not studying a real profession. ﻿I have no idea how you're going to raise a child in central Tel Aviv. ﻿- When can we meet? - ﻿But I trust you. ﻿You always manage somehow. ﻿I don't know how. ﻿Sorry. ﻿We can go now. -Got it? ﻿DAY 4 ﻿Mickey? ﻿Mickey. ﻿- So when can we meet? - - Tomorrow at Nilus, or come to my place - ﻿Fuck. ﻿Fuck. ﻿TMUNA THEATER ﻿Hey. Ilan. -Hey. ﻿What? ﻿got a rehearsal at nine. ﻿A rehearsal? On a Saturday? ﻿Yeah. News to me. ﻿The actors are coming, so... ﻿Let's not waste time. -OK. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Move rehearsals? ﻿You've been dragging this thing along for six months already. ﻿You know, we're still workshopping. ﻿OK. -It's not quite there yet. ﻿But if it's taken you six months already, when can I see the show? ﻿I mean... Will I live to see it? Am I going to be around? ﻿I hope so. I’m optimistic. -OK. ﻿But if you want to see a run through, we're doing one at five o'clock. I invited people. ﻿Spare me. I don't watch run throughs. and I don't watch theater. It makes me sick. ﻿No. more. ﻿Stretch it more. please. More. ﻿I can't stretch it any more. It's just right. ﻿No. it isn't. Last time it was better. Stretch it more, please. ﻿OK. fine. ﻿Is Yael here yet? ﻿I don't know. I suppose so. ﻿he always gets here when we finish setting up. -Fine. ﻿going for a sec. Finish up here. OK? ﻿Fine. I will. When do we finish today? ﻿I invited Ohad to the run through at 5:00. ﻿and until then we’ll do what we’ve got so far. -OK. ﻿I'll close up here. -Thanks. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Sorry. Excuse me. ﻿Oh. come on. Big deal. ﻿No. I was just surprised... ﻿You're sweet. ﻿Really? -What? ﻿So tell me. what's going on with you? ﻿How do you mean? ﻿What ﻿Never mind. ﻿Never mind. Rehearsal's about to start. ﻿Come on. what were you going to say? ﻿Have you noticed that I... ﻿That I like you? ﻿I don't usually notice things, but what exactly does that mean? ﻿That I... That I like you. ﻿That I... ﻿I really like you. I mean... ﻿﻿I'd even wish it if we could.. ﻿I dunno. look into it or something. ﻿You really surprise me. ﻿Really? Because I was sure that... -And right before a rehearsal... ﻿I'm really sorry. ﻿I'm really sorry. -You know I really admire you. ﻿And it's important to point out that Dana and I are getting divorced... ﻿Wow. This is so... ﻿Could you give me a few minutes? ﻿Of course. ﻿What time is it? ﻿Almost 12:00. -You wanted to start rehearsal at 12:00. right? ﻿So give me a few minutes. ﻿Sure. ﻿Hey. ﻿How's things? ﻿Good. ﻿Wait... ﻿Wait. ﻿So you live here by yourself? ﻿﻿I'm directing a show for Nickelodeon now. so I got rid of my roommates. ﻿It pays well. There's royalties, too. ﻿So you're all set. ﻿All set... ﻿As if that's even possible in Israel, unless your parents are rich. ﻿Trying to make it. ﻿So what exactly do you want to do to me? ﻿What ? ﻿You sounded so excited in all those messages. ﻿so I'd like to know what exactly are your plans for me. ﻿Plans? ﻿What... ﻿How do you imagine our relationship? ﻿I mean, if... ﻿If you're genuinely interested in something real happening between us. ﻿﻿I'm very into you. ﻿I think you're sexy. ﻿Yeah? ﻿How so? ﻿It's something you... ﻿give off. ﻿I feel we have chemistry. ﻿So basically, you want to fuck me. ﻿No... ﻿So you don't want to fuck me? ﻿I do. I... ﻿I just... I... ﻿﻿I feel like I could... ﻿fall in love with you. because there's something about you... ﻿Something... ﻿You wanna get naked? No.not me. ﻿You. ﻿You mean, just...? ﻿Take my clothes off? -I want to see you. Happy? ﻿So what now ﻿I don't know. ﻿I'm considering it. ﻿The psychological basis of the metropolitan type of individuality ﻿consists in the intensification of nervous stimulation ﻿which results from the swift and uninterrupted change ﻿of outer and inner stimuli. ﻿The city sets up for us. with each crossing of the street. ﻿a rapid crowding ﻿of changing images. ﻿in the grasp of a single glance. ﻿and impressions of an unexpected nature. ﻿The metropolitan type of man ﻿develops an organ protecting him ﻿against the threatening currents and discrepancies which would uproot him. ﻿currents and discrepancies of his external environment. ﻿He reacts with his head instead of his heart. ﻿and. in doing so. ﻿he reaction to the various phenomena is shifted ﻿to that organ which is least sensitive ﻿and quite remote from the depths of the personality. ﻿I can't believe he fell asleep right in front of us. That fucking idiot. ﻿Listen, you were great. ﻿Really, just great. It's... ﻿My hat's off to you. I've got a few notes. ﻿but I'll give them to you later. That was... My hat's off. ﻿You think he's going to join us? ﻿I have no idea. I'll talk to him. ﻿But the important thing right now is you guys. Never mind him. ﻿Seriously, great job. It's like... ﻿Something happened up there. ﻿Good job. really. Really, good job. ﻿﻿I'm all sweaty. -I don't care. ﻿I was moved. ﻿Good job. ﻿And you. too. Good job. ﻿Really, thanks so much. ﻿Really, thanks so much. ﻿So...Listen. ﻿Do you have the dates for October? Because I'll be traveling. ﻿Fine. I'll let you know in a couple of days. ﻿Hey. -Hey. ﻿Is the rehearsal at the amphitheater over? ﻿Yeah. Ended ten minutes ago. ﻿OK. I'm going in for a second. ﻿OK. ﻿Hey. ﻿Hey. ﻿Dana. Remember me ﻿Michael's wife. ﻿Of course. We sat together at Dan's wedding. -Right. ﻿Has Michael left already? ﻿Just ten minutes ago. ﻿OK. so... I'll try and find him. ﻿Call him. maybe. ﻿Right. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Let's do something. ﻿What? -Do you trust me? ﻿No. ﻿Please trust me. ﻿We're here. ﻿Are we even allowed up here? ﻿We can do whatever we want. ﻿No boundaries. ﻿Nice to hear. ﻿Wait. Is some guard going to catch us? ﻿Come on already. ﻿I hate this city. ﻿I really do. ﻿When did that happen? ﻿I hate you. too. ﻿You don't hate me. ﻿You don't even regret it. ﻿Something has to change. ﻿Yes. ﻿But why now? ﻿There might not be another chance. ﻿I'll never forgive you for this. ﻿You know? ﻿I know. DAY 5 ﻿Driver. ﻿Driver, pull over. -But we're not there yet. ﻿That's fine, we want to get off here. ﻿OK? Pull over please. ﻿OK. ﻿You accept credit cards, right? -No problem. Come. ﻿OK?
