Thank you. A toast. To what? To you finally leaving your wife. You'd like that. You have no idea. Oh yeah baby. You know what to do. Let me show you. Damn you, Mr. Frank. Miss Leanne's a fine woman! And she deserves much better than you! Hi, Daryl. Oh, oh Miss Leanne. How are you? All right, and yourself? Very good. I brought you some fresh squeezed lemonade and your favorite, tuna melt. Oh, wow, thank you but, Miss Leanne, it's not... It's not my lunch hour. Daryl, can I ask you a personal question? Oh, sure thing. And you don't have to answer it, if you feel uncomfortable with the question. You can ask me just about anything. You're sorta like family to me, like a beautiful sister that I never had. Frank? Frank? You bastard! We're having a baby. A baby girl. You bastard! You fucking bitch! You fucking bastard, we're having a baby! God - Oh my god, Frank! Is she dead? What did I do? What have I done? Oh my god! You saw it, she came after you! I stopped her, it was self-defense! It was self-defense! Frank, pull it together! Jesus Christ! - Listen to me! - What? We need to get rid of the body. And how do you propose we do that? Huh? You have the fire pit. We're gonna cut up the body, you're gonna burn it in the fire pit, Frank. Cut up the body? Are you fuckin' crazy, you twisted bitch? What are you talkin' about? Do you want to go to jail Frank? I'm trying to help you. You said you were leaving her. You said we were going to be together. Not like this. You need to do something. It's gonna be light before you know it, and your staff is going to be here. Oh man. We have to do this. Think of something. I have an ax in the basement. Okay, good. You go get the ax. I'm gonna drag her down to the fire pit, and you start the fire. Okay. Okay? You won't be needing this any more. Finally, we can be together. You're right. No witnesses. You won't be needing this any more... darling. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. It's just so unusual for her not to come home Has she been acting differently lately? No. Her schedule unusual? I guess so. You guess so? You know this is your wife we're talking about? How 'bout close friends? Maybe she spent the night with somebody? She has a few girlfriends but she always comes home. Excuse me, Frank. I was curious about this. It caught my eye. Can you tell me about that? We were expecting a girl. Okay, okay. Mind if we take a look around, Frank? Maybe talk to some of your staff? Sure. The cleaning lady comes on Fridays, and Daryl is out back. Daryl? Yeah, he takes care of the property, the pool, a little bit of everything. Okay, I'll go talk to him, but... Frank, I gotta be honest with you. I can't even file a missing persons report for, shit, another... 12 hours. Right, so I just sit around and wait by the phone. Sorry Frank, but it's procedure. After all I've done for your department, you can't expedite a fucking search? We're gonna do everything we can. Now where's this Daryl again? Out back. Okay, Frank. Just try to think of anything you can that might help us. We'll go talk to your guy. Hey, Daryl? Oh, yeah? Got a minute? We'd like to have a word. All right. Just a sec. Daryl, Detective Jacobson, this is Samuels. Pleased to meet you, sir. Pleased to meet you. We're from missing persons. I'd like to have a few words with you. Why don't you come on over and have a seat? Well, I got work to tend to, sir. Just take a minute. Why don't you have a seat? Well, if you insist. We do. State your name. My name's Daryl. Daryl what? What's your last name? Daryl Brown, sir. Daryl Brown. Yes, sir. When was the last time you saw Miss Johnson? Miss Leanne? Yes, Miss Leanne. I'd have to say yesterday. You'd have to say yesterday? Yes, sir. Right out here. She brought me out some lemonade and a sandwich. Seems like a nice lady. Oh, the nicest of ladies. Tell me more about your relationship with Miss Leanne. Well, I work for the Johnsons. Miss Leanne is a... a friend, I would say. She always talks to me and treats me kindly. She brings me lemonade. So you're saying she was here yesterday. She brought your lemonade and a sandwich. Yes, sir. It was yesterday. You didn't see anything unusual at all after that time? This is my card. If you can remember anything from that day at all, I want you to give me a call. Can you handle that? Yes, sir. All right. Well... That's just about it. I mean, for now. So... I just wait? Just for now, Frank. We're gonna work the case, okay? Just... if you can think of anything, give me a call. Okay? Keep me posted. Will do. Hey, Frank? Try not to go anywhere. I'm sure we'll be talking again soon. Samuels... Jesus. The hell's wrong with you? I know, I know, I know I haven't been out here since... yesterday morning, but I'm here. You ain't got to worry. I ain't gonna leave you dry, let the termites and things eat at you. And no, that is not how Arnold sounds. You know better than that. Arnolds' more of a... "Get down, get out of there! "What's wrong with Billy?" "Get to da chopper!" Moreso like that. Now you know that Mr. Frank used to always say that I wasn't worth a damn and my imitations suck. Well, I never listen to that. No I didn't. Detective. Hey Frank. Hey. What brings you out? Frank, I got some news. I thought you'd want to hear it in person. Sure. It's hot out. You want some water? Yeah, sure. That'd be great. Hope I'm not disturbing you. No, I'm... I'm in between sessions. So... Did you find my wife? Oh, Frank... This water tastes funny. Yeah, it's from the well, so when it rains... Sure. No. I came to tell you we're closing the case. Exhausted all leads. There's nothing more we can do. What am I supposed to do with that? I'm sorry Frank. It just seems like she's vanished. I'm sorry Frank. Frank, I'm not gonna give up. It's a promise. Thank you, Detective. Sorry to interrupt. You know I can't concentrate when you barge in, Jules. Yeah I remember, but you have a phone call. Can't you take a message? I think you're gonna want to take this one. It's the insurance company about your wife's claim.. Hm, okay. Can you reschedule my 2:00 p.m. for the 14th? Mh-hm. Line 2. Can I help you? Is this Frank Johnson? Yes. This is Chance Fisher with Essence Life Insurance. Can I verify the last four digits of your social security number, please? 8875. Great. We wanted to verify where you wanted the funds from your former wife's policy? I see. Yes. It's our policy that after a certain amount of time lapses in disappearance cases, we release the funds to the surviving spouse. Would you prefer a hard check mailed to your home or your office? Um... A direct... Can you arrange for a direct deposit? Of course. We have that information on file, unless your account information has changed. No, no, it's the same. Do you have a... an amount of the policy? Yes, sir. $11 million. I see. And when would those funds be transferred? We send them out today, so your bank will have them by morning. Very good. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Holy Shit! Oh my... Jules! Yeah? I want you... to... get your bikini... sell the cat. Call all my clients. I'm officially retired, baby. Oh! Oh my God! We're outta here I'm so happy for you. Okay, go, go. Okay, okay. Yes. If I had to... You get right on in there. Hey, Daryl? Oh! Oh, hi, Mr. Frank. You talking to somebody? Oh no, I was just singing and tending to the fireplace. Well look, I'm gonna be taking off for a little while. I'm not gonna be around for a bit so... All right. I won't need you to take care of the place anymore. But, sir! The plants... the pool... who's going to look after 'em while you're gone? Well... Oh man. My favorite. Did you know that this pine tree is not relative to the desert, but yet it's relative to Arizona, but usually the higher country like Pinetop and Flagstaff or something like that. Can I ask you a personal question, Daryl? And you don't have to answer it if you don't want to. Oh sure thing ma'am, you can ask me almost anything. You're like my family. You're sorta like a beautiful sister that I never had. You flirting with me Daryl? Oh no, no ma'am. I wouldn't do such a thing. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. All right. No, but what's the highest education that you ever had? Well, I did finish high school. Not at the top of the class, nothing like that. Me neither, that would be my husband. Have you ever thought about college? Oh, no. No, no, ma'am. I... I don't fit in in any college class. Oh Daryl, they would love you. You think? I do think. You know what? What's that, ma'am? I'm gonna be leaving for the next three days. That I know. I'll take care of the place while you're gone. And I do appreciate that. What do you think about us, when I get back, going up north to the university and checking it out just to see what the horticulture program is like? You think... You think I could... I could really fit in in a college? Oh Daryl, yes you would fit in. Like I said, they would love you. Absolutely. You know, in fact, that's is what we're gonna do. When I get back, I promise you, we're going to go up north and check out that university, okay? Thank you very much, Miss Leanne. Please, Mr. Frank. Yeah, okay. Why don't you stay on? But I can only pay you half. That's not a problem Mr. Frank. Frank! Frank, are you ready to celebrate? I'll get back to my workings. Yeah, Jules, I'll be right there All right, all right. Yeah, get on in there. Fire up. You know, I don't think I properly thanked you. Well, we should probably get to that. Awfully hot today, I'll tell you that much. You always come in handy. I reckon I might just jump on in and have a swim. Haven't been in here in a while. Yeah, that feels good. Oh. Feels strange. Feels like something is pulling my pants off. How did I get in this pool? Where my clothes at? Babe, you've got to see this house. It has an amazing pool. I've been trying to sell this listing for over a year. Might as well enjoy it. Stan? This isn't funny. Stan! Where the fuck are you? Stan? Stan, where are you? I'm not playing, I'm gonna leave! Hey, Samuels, look who it is. Daryl, right? How you do, sir? Funny how we always keep running into each other like this. Well, I do work here, sir. Another funny thing, you know, local PD found a car by the side of the road abandoned. Can't find the owner. You wouldn't happen to know about that would you? Well, I can't say I do, sir. Sure. The owners home? No, sir. Last I heard they were traveling. They're traveling. Of course. So you're trying to tell me you haven't seen anything strange happen around here in the last couple of days. That what you're saying? No, sir. Just me here with the plants and the pool and... that about it. Sounds about right. Well, it's always a pleasure talking to you, Daryl. Same to you, sir. We gotta stop running into each other like this. I guess so, sir. We'll be in touch, okay? Okay, sir. Don't go anywhere. You take care now. ♪ I can't get no ♪ I don't know about this. I don't know. Because its so big. This is a lot of... This could be an unbelievable... Our own little just secret spot, yeah? There you go again. That's brilliant darling, yes! It's really nice.

Oh my goodness. See, Mr. Yates? You'll have a his and hers cars. Wouldn't you agee? Like that, right? I agree with that totally. This one's been a bit big for her actually. Darling, this seems too good to be true, honestly. And there's no catches? No catches. You buy the house, you get everything. You get it all? The house, the car, the pool, the view, the helicopter. Everything. So your wife said... Wait, mate. Can I? Yes, sir. Your wife said you like gadgets. Yes he does. You know the routine, Mr. Yates. Are you ready? Want to press it with daddy? Press the yellow button. Let's try it again. Hold it down. Oh! You guys, let me show you this wonderful view. Oh my goodness. Darling, can you get the stroller? And before you head out to your miraculous backyard, look at this view you have when you wake up before you even go outside. The grills come with it? The grill come with it, sir. Mr. Yates, I've saved the best view for last. Look at this remarkable scenic view. Ah, this is fantastic mate. Let me help you with the baby. Oh, thank you, thank you. Dani's flying down! Dani's a superhero, she is. Let's take her in the shade. - It's hot out here. - Yeah. Let's get you in some shade, young lady. Here sweetie. Let's block some of that sun off you. Darling! Darling, she's fine. Come along, take a look at this. And Mr. Yates, this view over here is North Scottsdale. At night its like a light show. And then if you look over here this way at night, you'll see the beautiful sunset over the mountain. That's fantastic. I feel stupid. I thought she couldn't swim. She can't swim. Well they say babies are natural swimmers when they come out of the womb, so you've got something positive out of all of this. Let me retrieve my glasses. What the hell happened to you? I panicked! Sorry. Well Mr. Yates, as I was saying, back to this beautiful... Mate. Mate, mate. Consider the house sold. Thank you. Greg? Greg, babe, can you come out here for a minute please? Darling I'm just in the middle of a good bit, yeah? I know, but Mom just got here, and she's out at the pool. I need you to go keep her company. I'll go finish up in the kitchen. When did she get here? She just got here. Can you go that for me, please? Of course. Tell me, darling, did she say anything about the house? She didn't say a word, did she? No, but listen, she's only been here five minutes. She hasn't even seen the house yet. Listen. Everything's gonna be just fine, yeah? In fact, everything's gonna be perfect. All right. If you say so. I do say so. What's for supper? I don't know, what do you want? Whatever Dani would like. I'm not having hot dogs tonight. Hello, mum. Hey, honey. What's this, a new case or something? Yeah, it's a good one. I'll tell you all about it. But do you know the history of this place? I know that someone owned it before we did and... I don't know, maybe the wife ran off with a friend or husband. Point is I got it at an estate sale for a really good price. Why? Why? I get a really uneasy feeling. That's the same thing your daughter said. Yeah, well... May I make a suggestion? Of course. How about we get the house blessed? - Mom. - Anybody... Anyone... Anyone of your choosing. Rabbi, ordained minister, priest, Buddhist monk, it doesn't matter, just something for me and for my granddaughter. For you. Because it's you. Thank you. Shit! Bitch. Hello, may I speak to Father Matthews please? Good day to you as well, Father. You don't know me, my name is Greg Yates. I got your name from Vera Joy. She said that you might be able to help us with a situation at our home. That would be wonderful actually. Well, I know you are in the city, we are about 30 minutes out. Big house in the middle... Yes, that's the one, in the middle of the desert. We did buy it, yes. That would be fantastic. Brilliant. We'll see you then Father. Thank you so much. Hold a moment. Hello. Please, come in. Actually, it's not necessary to remove your shoes. It's very necessary. Quite right. So I'd like to thank you for making the trek all the way out here. Quite a drive. She's waiting on me. Beg your pardon? Oh, yes. Just in the den. Darling, meet Father... Is it Father? Father Matthew. Nice to meet you, Father. Nice to meet you. There's no disrespect. There's just quite a lot going on here. Catholicism, Protestantism? Neo-Judaism? Ba'hai Temple? I don't know. Just asking. All of the above. Ah, okay. What can I do for you? Well, darling maybe... Well, Father... It's the house. We just recently moved in and... I don't know, just something is not quite right. Whispers in the hallways. Creaking lumber in the ceiling. No, be serious Things that go bump in the night. Fanciful stories, but good for the blood I think. What is it that you feel? I don't know, I just... I feel uneasy, like there's just something not quite right. I can't explain it. And do you? I'll be honest with you, mate. I don't feel a damn thing. But... my wife says she feels something, and I would rather her feel safe in our home, yes? Stand. And give me your hands. It's all right, darling. Something to drink perhaps? Coffee, tea? Or something a bit stronger perhaps? Cola. Cola. Darling, have we any Cola? Um... I believe so. Right then, I will take tea, Earl Grey, hot. Um, Father if you would come with me, I will give you the nickel tour of the home. This way, if you please. Here we picked up the house for quite a lovely price. Father Matthew? Bloody hell! What? Father Matthews! Pulse. Mate! Father Matthews, wake up, wake up, wake up! Come on, come on, man, wake up! There's a good man. There, yeah, blink, blink. Can't have you dying at my house, mate. Come on, on your feet, mate. On your feet mate, on your feet. Come on, come on, get up, get up. Oh, shit, your head! Man, your head, mate. Oh my god. Darling? Hey babe, what's up? Hey, my love. Um, the Father took a rather nasty spill. Are you serious? Is he okay? Um, he's fine, a bit of blood, but no he's good, he's good. Do you think it's best if he stays the night though? Yeah, I definitely want him to stay. You'd rather have a holy man in the house? Don't start that. Do you need me to grab some towels and maybe a toothbrush or something? Yes, I was just going to ask if you could get some toiletries and what have you and take them downstairs to him. Fantastic. Why are you in your... bath towel? I took a shower. Is that okay? So does that mean you're all wet? No, that means I'm all clean. No, no! Can I make you dirty? No, but look, can you please have Daryl check the water again? What's wrong with the water this time? Well it was perfectly fine in my shower and then all of a sudden it went ice cold. I had to get out. Don't look at me like that. Darling, you see, there's a blue knob and a red knob. I know the difference. I'll just shut up now, shall I? Thank you. Could you have him check the water please? - Yes, my love. - Thank you. Stop looking at me. Okay. Greg! Greg! Yes, darling, yes! Get in here! No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's coming. Wait, just wait. Darling, there's nothing wrong... No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You know, I think you really think there's something spooky going on here but there... I think my mother was right. - No, darling, it's fine! - No, no, no, no. I'll call Daryl and have him fix it. See? It stopped. Father Matthews? Would you like a cup of tea before I go on my walk? Father Matthews, are you there? Good morning, darling. Hey babe. I'm all sweaty, I'm all sweaty! I don't care, I don't care. Get over here. Did you make Father Matthews a cup of tea? No, why would I? You haven't seen him? Course not. You're the first person I've seen this morning. Oh babe, you know that sweet old man hit his head last night He's fine. He's probably just sleeping No, no, we need to check on him. For all we know he's in there dead. Stop shoving! Father Matthews? Rise and shine, you old gaffer. Father Matthews? Father? Is he not there? Call the church, darling. Where are you? Father Matthews, this is Greg Yates calling you again. My wife and I are very concerned about you. We didn't find you in the guest room this morning. Please, if you could call us back at your earliest convenience. Just let us know that you're all right. Sure is hot out here today. Yeah, it is. You want some lemonade, Daryl? Oh yes, I'd would be much obliged, ma'am. Now, do you like a lot of ice or just a little bit? Oh, lots of ice, much as you can spare. It's hot. Oh, by the way, that plumbing, how's it coming along? Uh... It's... Well I'll get right on it, I'm sorry. I'll get right on it. I've been trying to fix it. I know you been trying, Daryl, but we still having a few kinks. All righty. What's that? This here's the catch for the pool. No, no, no, what's this? Some sort of necklace you may have lost. No, these are Father Matthews' rosary beads. Well, how did it get in the pool? I don't know. You didn't happen to see him out here swimming, did you? No, I didn't even know the Father was here. Hmm. That's strange. I'd say. I'll be back, Daryl. All right then. I'll get on that plumbing. Chinese food! Whoa, bruv, you are brave for wearing that, mate. $32.15, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here you go, mate. You brave for stayin' here, brah. What do you mean by brave, mate? Look it up! Honey, did you ever call the priest again? Actually I did. I've left him about two voice messages, but hasn't called me back yet. Thank you, darling. Maybe he just wants us to leave a donation for the church. Really, that wouldn't be a bad idea. You know, we found his rosaries over out at the pool, in the filter. Can you pass me some? How did those wind up there? I don't know, it's the strangest thing. Maybe he went for a swim. Doesn't make any sense. Darling, can you get me some wine? It didn't, but I'm telling you, it was really weird because that was the only sign of him ever even being here. The realtor. Did he ever say anything to you about the house? Like what? I don't know, anything that would stand out to you. Um, not really. I mean the only thing I knew about the previous owner was one of them was a... I think it was the husband, he was a world renowned doctor. What sort of a doctor? I think it was some sort of a shrink. I'm not sure though. Hm. Why, what's up? Just... The delivery guy, he... I don't think he was comfortable delivering to the house. - What did he say? - He sort of showed up. Dropped the bag off and bolted. Okay, now that's odd. He just seemed really uncomfortable. See, I told you that there was something going on with this house. There's nothing wrong with the house. Mm-hm. It's a lovely house. It's not our fault if some crack pot doctor can't keep his wife from swimmin' off with some other man. Oh, so that's what's happened? That's precisely what happened. See, I'm a man who knows how to please his woman. Is that right? That's precisely right. In fact... Mm-hm? I think we should try to put another baby in you. Oh god! Don't do that, don't do that. How's your food? It's good. You know I love Chinese food. I do know your love Chinese food, and I love you, so I think once we're done eating, we should break in a couple of the rooms in the house. You're so bad. You have no idea. Come here. Get this box out of the way. So much clothing! Yes! Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Yates? How do you like your hedges trimmed? I don't know. Darling, do you like your bush square or round? Let's take a look... Get rid of him. Round is fine, Daryl. Well all right. Actually, actually, if you could go to the other side of the property and start there, that would be brilliant. Away from this area would be nice. That's fine by me. You are getting blinds on these windows. Whatever you want, darling. Now where were we? Can I help you? Greg Yates? Yeah, that's me. Detective Jacobson, Missing Persons. Mind if I ask you a few questions? I'm sorry, come in Detective. Come in, come in. Nice place you have here. How long you lived here? Thanks, thanks. We haven't been here but maybe a week or two, if that. Do you know a Father Matthews? Yeah, yeah, good guy. Our sources tell me that you and your wife were the last people to see him. I can't say we were the last people to see him. He was here about a week ago.. So when did he leave? I can't really say to be sure. We had him over to bless the home. Like I said, we just bought it. So he came over, had a cup of tea, gave him a tour of the house, walked about a bit. You know, he did have a bit of an injury. Really? What kind of injury? Well he slipped and fell on a bit of a puddle of water. Cracked his noggin a bit. So we insisted that he stay. I mean, safety first and all that. So he didn't leave on Tuesday. He probably left on Wednesday then. I can't say that. You can't say that? Listen, Detective, when we got up in the morning, my wife went and checked on him. He wasn't in the room. Toiletries we gave him weren't used. The bed was barely slept in. You didn't find that a bit odd? Oh, no, completely strange. But he is a Father, right? So we figured maybe he had mass in the morning. Probably finished blessing the home and went after that. So, did he leave the door unlocked after he left? I can't say. When I came down to check the door, it was locked, but my wife could have locked it, my daughter could have locked it. It's a bit strange. But you know, we don't even file a missing person's report until after 24 hours. Father Matthews has been gone now for almost a week. You wouldn't mind if I looked around now, would you? He's been gone for a week? That's what I said. Would you mind if I look around? No, no, no, by all means, please. If I can get ahold of your business card? Certainly. If I can remember anything. I'll can give my wife a call and we can see if she remembers anything. You may want to ask our groundskeeper some questions. He's up all times of night. Really? Yeah, maybe he saw something. Now, what's his name? Daryl, big guy, can't miss him, like a oak tree. Really? How long has he worked for you? Well, we've only had the place for about a week or so. He came with the house, sort of like an amenity. Oh yeah. I'll just go talk to him then if you don't mind. Yeah, yeah, no problem. He's just out on the deck there. ♪ I can't get no ♪ Daryl, Daryl, Daryl. Detective Jacobson, right? That's right. I'm getting kind of tired running into you like this. I can't say I'm happy to see you either, sir. Is that right? You know, people keep coming up missing around here, and you're still around. Why do you think that is, Daryl? Well, I don't think anything, sir. I tends to my business around here, and peoples' comings and goings are none of my concern. Is that right? Yes, sir. How 'bout that priest that was here last week. Did you get to meet him? Well, no, sir. I know nothing of no priest. Of course you don't. What was I thinking? I don't know what to tell you, sir. Don't know what to tell me. You know, it's funny, Daryl. You never know what to tell me. Are you telling me that you've never noticed anything that's gone on at this house? Sir, lower your tone please. I know what I know. I know the trees, the plants, the pool. That all. That's funny. I know what I know too. And I know that you're hiding something from me. Aren't you, big boy? Sir, I don't take too kindly to one touching my persons. You can understand that, right? You can understand I don't take too kindly to people lying to me. I would never lie to you, sir. I have nothing to lie for. Is that a fact? Yes, sir. So you've seen nothing here that you want to tell me about right now? I have seen nothing at all, sir. You did say something about a priest coming here, right? Yeah, I did, Daryl. I would suppose that a priest would have rosary beads, right? Yeah, priests have rosary beads. Well, some rosary beads were found out back. Out back where? Well, in the pool. So you found some rosary beads in the pool? Well, no, no, no, I didn't, but Miss... I think maybe you ought to talk to Mrs. Yates about this. No, no, Daryl, I'm talking to you right now. Like I said, the goings on around here is not my business. So Mrs. Yates can point you in the right direction. He said that the farther's been missing for a week. What do you mean missing for a week? He's been missing for a week. Since he was at our place? Excuse me Officer. Hey, I just finished talking to your groundskeeper. Daryl, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. He mentioned, Miss Yates, that... you found some rosary beads in the pool. Is that right? Did I find the rosary beads? Pardon me, but... Miss Yates, Mr. Yates... I don't mean to be rude but... detective I have never told you that Mrs. Yates found some rosary beads. I did say... rosary beads were found, but I never said by whom. And quite personally, sir, what goes on on these grounds are the Yates' business. Good man, Daryl. Thank you, sir. Loyalty is hard to come by. I'm doubling your pay. Well, thank you, sir. I sure could use some extra money, with mama's health care getting so costly. It'll come in handy. Consider it done. Much obliged, sir. Miss. Yates, I'd like to see those beads please. Excuse me, officer. I don't like your tone. I'm sorry. You should be. You've come into my house. We've been nothing but helpful. Do not take that tone with my wife. Or with Daryl, for that matter. Sure, absolutely. Miss Yates? Yes. Please, can I see the beads? Darling? What beads? Babe, remember the beads I told you about? That Daryl found out at the pool. The one I told you that the priest was wearing. - The father's rosary? - Yes. We have them. Okay. Give me a minute. Remember, the beads? Those beads? Yes, these beads May I take those? Sure. Thank you. Now that's what I need. If there's anything else we can assist you with, please don't hesitate to ask, officer. It's Detective. - Apologies. - Good day, Yates. You can see yourself out, I'm sure. You know what? I think we're almost there. Yeah, I like what you just gave me there with the theater and all that. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, I think its finally coming together. Yeah, I think that works. Oh, hey! I forgot to tell you, I have a family reunion next weekend. You and the last minute changes, mate! Hey, happy wife, happy life. So I am not going to be here, which leaves you and Missy to do it all. Well it's not a problem. You go and enjoy your family time, yeah? Fine with me. Then that will give Missy and I a little bit of time to... see things from a different perspective. That works. I'm looking forward to it. So let's get this wrapped up for the rest of the night. All right. And... So then we're on 52. 152, and I love that movie theater scene, the shooting, the theater, I love that, mate. It works, but I think we need a little bit more... I mean, I remember a sort of show like that but I like the idea of vampire strippers. You know, they come in, they don't come up. But I think that's been done with Tales from the Crypt Bordello of Blood, hasn't it? Diagon Alley! We're at the fuckin... Yeah, yeah, yeah, a whole rows of vampires. This is only geared toward men. No women... No, no, no, no! Werewolves! Werewolves are for women. Sexy werewolves! Dani? I had a good day. You didn't, why? Oh, 'cause you're always trapped in the water. You can barely even get out. Dani? Darling? Who are you speaking to? My friend. What friend? She's right there. You have a friend in the water. Yeah. How long have you had a friend in the water? Since I fell in. You remember that? Yeah. Would you ever forget if someone saved your life? No darling, I don't suppose I would. Hey, how ya doin' down there, ah? You all right? Okay. Ha ha ha! Yeah! My nigga. That's how we doin' it? All right. All right, you little ants, you wanna run around here, ah? I know Mr. Frank, he don't know what he talking about, 'cause I think I'm pretty good. What kind of varmints in there? Think I got a snake hole, here. Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, you got a snake hole all right. All right, uh-huh. You better fill it! Mr. Yates sure do know how to roll in style. That's why I keep it clean. This is like a car that Jay Z and them be driving. Yeah! Marcy Projects! It's the rock! Rockefeller's forever! I'm pretty damn good. I bet I can swing higher than you. Yes I can! Sweetheart? Yeah? Who you speaking with? My friend. Your friend? Yeah, my friend. Oh, kids these days. Dani, you come on now. Run along, mama's calling. Okay. Yes. Yes! Honey! Half a moment, darling. - Darling. - Hey babe. Come on. So, what's up? I am going out for some errands. What sort of errands? Well, I have a few things I need to do. Okay. Hey Missy! Hey Steph. Come look, can you call the plumber? The water is still out. Daryl fixed it. No he didn't. Nice guy, but the water still on the outs. The hot water's cold, the cold water is hot. Half the time I can't get it to turn on. Please call someone today. Whatever you like. Whatever you like. All right, you go handle your business, and we will be here writing. A few hours maybe. Can't wait for you to read this one. Really? It's that good? It is that good. Well, you guys keep working. I'll see you in a bit Yes, ma'am. Love you, darling. You know we're not done yet? Aren't we? Not even close. Fantastic working with you. We'll see you tomorrow. - See ya Steph. - Bye Missy. Hello Love. Hey! How was your day? Oh, it was fantastic. Yeah? Did you guys get a lot done? So much work done. All right, pork chops for dinner. Darling, again? What's wrong with pork chops? If you don't want that, then what do you want? Get over here. Oh my God. You are so freaky. You know it. Ew! Hi Mom, Hi Dad! Hi baby! Hello darling. Take your backpack off. How was school today? It was cool. We got to play with frogs in science today. Did you get to dissect them? Ew, Dad, that's gross! I agree, I agree. But look, take these little grubby hands downstairs, wash them, and I'll call you up with it's time for dinner. Hey, hey. Oy! Don't forget your backpack. Sorry. You want a snack, Dani? Yes, Mom. Okay, I'll be down in a little bit. ♪ Ring around the rosie ring around the rosie ♪ ♪ Pocket full of posies pocket full of posies ♪ ♪ Ashes ashes ♪ ♪ We all fall down ♪ Who's there? Damn kids. Who threw that? Is that someone mucking about? I'll have you, I will! Good morning, darling. Good morning. You were brilliant last night. If that were the case, then where were you when I rolled over? You weren't in bed. Going to the loo. What are you doing? So much scotch. Oh my goodness! Question; Yes? Did you spill on the rug last night outside the door? No. Why? Big puddle of water. Well I mean, I did water the big plant out there. It could be from that. No, it's more than that. Hmm. I did get out of bed though. Yeah, I know. Were you up working? Had some new thoughts about the new script so I decided to go for a walkabout. I went to the back door, I actually thought I heard voices. I went to the back door to the deck and it was open. Did you leave it open? No. Remember, you were the last one to come in. You got Dani from out... Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right. The strangest thing happened. One of the pool balls smashed me in the back of the head. Come on now. It was so strange. It was almost like, I hate to say it, like it was haunted or something. See? Now you're on the same page as me! - I told... - But No, no I told you. The ball just bounced out of nowhere and hit you on the back of the head? There are no such things as ghosts. Maybe the neighbors' children were, I don't know, messing about or something like that. The nearest house is a mile away. What do you mean? Well, I prefer logical explanations to spooks and specters, yeah? Mm-hm. Pancakes? Yeah. We can get started. The next thing we need to do is solidify a director. So what's this $11 million gonna cost me? You know what I want. You're not my Mommy, you're not my Mommy, you're not my Mommy! You're not my mommy, you're not my mommy! Daddy, I'm tired. Oh daring, oh darling. - What's happening? - Is she okay? What's going on? Just a bad dream, I think. She'll be fine. Everyone, I'm so very sorry. This one here needs some daddy-daughter time, so I'm going to put her to bed. And if I'm correct, we've secured our funding, doctor? So we will... begin shortly. My wife will farewell you all. Goodnight. Feel better, baby. Thanks for coming. Good night. It's okay, Steph. It's gonna be okay. I don't now, Becky. I don't know what to do anymore. She's been up all night. She's having nightmares. Greg, he doesn't know what to do. We're just lost. I've tried everything. What can I do? Tell me. You know I'll do anything. I don't think there is anything that can be done. I'm lost. I don't know. I'm glad I have her. I love her. I just... I don't know. It's okay to break down like this. You have been the strong one all your life as far as I remember. It's okay, I'm here. I'll do whatever it takes, you know that. And listen to me. Something you need to know is the admiration and respect that I have for you, for what you've done, adopting that beautiful little girl. It's incredible. I don't know. You and I were both adopted. We know what that life is like. Trust that I'm here for you. - Thank you. - I love you. I love you too, Becky. Is she okay? Yeah, she's... She's fine, she's sleeping, finally. I'm worried about her. I don't know, darling, maybe... Maybe we adopted the wrong child. Maybe you married the wrong woman! Try the couch! Good evening, doctor. The check, as you requested. And an extra million for our trip. Venice, July. Can't wait. Mr. Yates. Mind the car, Detective. Of course. I've got a few questions to ask you. Concerning? Mr. Levin. Am I under arrest, Detective? It would be in your best interest to come with me. Now, we can do this one of two ways. Considering the circumstances, I can see why it would be in my best interest to come. Am I joining you in your vehicle or can I take mine? You can take yours. Thank you, Detective. Lead the way. So we have this evening to ourselves. You have no idea how excited I am about that. I would like to teach you something that you maybe have never heard of called paper dolls. By the way, being good is just being you, okay? There's no such thing as good. So what do you feel like doing? Hmm. I want to go out to the pool and play with my friend. Your friend? What friend? Don't you have friends? A lot of my friends have passed away, but I got a few left. I was murdered. Dani? What are you talking about, sweetie? What are you talking about? Grandma, I'm tired. You know... One of us has to go. What in the world? How did I get here? Sleeping on the job I guess. Getting old. Back to work. You're gonna die! Darling? Oh yes, that's a good girl. Good girl, good girl. Give daddy the knife, give daddy the knife. Daddy, I'm tired. Oh yes. Daddy's gonna take you to bed, love. Come on. Okay. What the hell? God. Help! Let me out! God I loved her! Oh God forgive me, I loved her! Missy's dead. Missy's dead. Told you Daddy she was gonna die. Dani. Why would say that to Daddy? Why would say that to Daddy? Go to your room. Go to your room! Bastard! Half a moment! Half a bloody moment! Detective. Please. Please come in. Sounds like I was disturbing something there, Mr. Yates. No, no... Yeah. I knocked over the drum there. Not as concerned about that as I am about the dead body in your driveway. What can you tell me about that? Missy left the other evening after we had a writing session. A writing session, huh? Yes. How good of a friend was she? She was... She was one of my best friends. Oh yeah. I'm sure she was, Greg. I will not stand here and be berated by you in my house! Don't leave town. Where's my Stephanie? I want my Stephanie. Stephanie! Steph! It's all your fault! Thank you. I'm glad he's gone. Gregory? Oh hi, baby. You seen your Daddy? Daddy's gone. What do you mean Daddy's gone? He won't hurt us anymore, I promise. Will you do my a favor then? Mm-hm. As soon as Greg gets here, can you come up and wake me? Yeah, or course. Thanks Mom. Hey baby. He's not coming back. He loved her like he loved Mommy. Sweetie, why don't you go upstairs, change your school clothes, and wait for me, I'll be right up, and fix your hair like the way you love it, okay? He had an affair in my house. He screwed that bitch in my house, Mom. Our home. I'm pissed but... - Honey, I feel really... - I'm pissed. I know, I understand. I feel really terrible for you. You need to get some rest and please let me deal with this. We're gonna figure this out. We're gonna figure it out together. I'm tired. - I'm tired, mom. - I know. I know. That's what I'm saying. I know you are. Okay Come on, sweetie. Thank you for coming. I love you Mommy. I love you too sweetie. Can you please get Dani something to eat? I haven't had time to do anything. I'm freakin' exhausted. Mom. Thanks for adopting me. Oh god. Are you kidding me? Oh my god. Dani? Honey? Dani? Dani, I have something for you. I have some food. Sweetie? Dani? Dani, I met your friend.
