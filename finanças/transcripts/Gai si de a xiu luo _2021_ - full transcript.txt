Hey, man. Hey, man. I've got customers waiting for a table. Sorry. How much is it? $60 -It's a gun. What do you want? What's happening? That guy's got a gun. What you doing? -What's going on? What's going on? That guy's got a gun. Run. Has anybody called the police? He's got a gun. Watch your back. I dreamt that dream again. (Chapter One: Raging Zero) In the dream, all of humanity has disappeared, except for me and Oreo. Jan Wen, hurry up. Damn, you video the same thing every day. The owner will come out soon. Oreo, come on. Come out. Go on then. It didn't look like Oreo wanted to run away. How do you know? You're not him. I just know. I've drawn your ending. Have a look. I think the story ends too suddenly... ... seems a bit rushed. Raging Zero just hacking away like that. And then it all ends. It feels weird. How long can we keep this going? I'm still going abroad. Leave it as itis. That's very enthusiastic of you. After you go abroad, we won't be able to do the comic together. You said we were going to do animation in college. That's all gone now. Alright, alright I'm in. Where are you? (The King's Realm) Waiting for you by the Bridge to Hades. Holy shit. So you want to pass the Bridge now? What? You're the one who wants to pass it. Isn't it that in the next life all your strength and treasure will be upgraded? It's up to you. But if we pass the bridge now, we will lose lots of things. You're always like that... always just saying things. If you couldn't hear clearly at the Demolition meeting, why didn't you wear your hearing aid? You're only wasting your time going through these and you still don't get it. You wear one yourself then. The sound is so sharp, and I still can't hear properly. It also gives me headache. Headache? See, building A is so tall. If we get into either B or C, we won't be able to see the sun. They're only swapping 43m2 for 33. You want to accept the deal? What? I mean, why don't we just take the money? Where can we live with that? Why are there so many leftovers? You didn't finish selling the rice balls? Oh. I got up a bit late this morning. A bit late? What time did you stop drinking last night? Huh? Nothing. When X is zero, what does that mean? It means the flip side happens three times. It's 1/2 multiplied by 1/2 multiplied by 1/2. So it's 1/2 to the power of 3. So it equals 1/8. What's the probability of it appearing 13 times in a row? What's so funny? Hey, Lin Jialin. Lin Jialin. What are you looking at that's so funny? 8,192. Huh? It's 8,192. 2 to the power of 13. What's all the noise about? This is 12th grade stuff, you should know this. Stop making noise. Lin Jialin, if you didn't work part-time at the Karaoke bar, if you cut down on your jobs, with your math talent, you could go to university. You know that? But I haven't even paid the tuition fee yet. Do you want to pay it for me? What? What what? Oh, and my mom's hearing aid also. It's too expensive and I can't afford it. Do you want to buy it for me? Fine. If you apply for the Math Entrance Exam I will pay for it all. Teacher, I'm also very poor. You shut up. Teacher, pick me. Hey. Are you from urban renewal? Yes. Harding work, eh? Nah. You've been living it up. No. I never do. Just kidding. Hiya, this is my namecard. May I ask what you're reporting on this time? Is it about the Liming Building? Relax. I'm not reporting on you guys this time. This time it's about them, the people who live here. The people with stories. The people with stories? You too. You have your own difficulties. You have stories, too. I don't have any stories. I don't live here, either. It's tough for you. Sorry for being late. I was dealing with some stuff. Village chief, our section chief is on his way. He will be here soon. No worries, he can take his time. Hello, village chief. You are that... that famous journalist, Mr. Mei. I'm not famous at all. You can call me Mold. Mo...? Mold. Oh, Mold. -How you doing? We have lots of mold here. It's so damp here. There's so much mold everywhere. Linlin. Tell you mom to move that stall. It's been there for days. Tell her yourself. That's it, I'm recycling it then. Whatever. Village chief, is that Linlin? Yes, do you know her? I have an interview with her. Interview? What can you get from that little rascal's mouth? Why don't you come inside with me? Let me introduce you to someone better. Hi, everyone. I'm Shine. Let the light shine. That's right. We know that the Brahma Sword can break through spacetime, so we can go back into the past and amend our strategy mistakes. But with the Brahma Sword on its own, you can't act like me and dominate the Gondwana continent. So, today I'm going to try this for you guys. I'm using the Shiny Stone with the Brahma Sword to play the Instance at the Bridge to Hades. Hey, Zero, you're back. Hi, Shine. Zero, you haven't forgot 10 o'clock? Not a chance. We will explore Laurasia. No problem. I will meet you there after my streaming. Sure. Okay. I'll now pillage for a bit. Let me see, which one is unlucky. Check how I'm going to beat you with the Brahma Sword. What now? I only help pretty girls, so what? You have a problem with that? Shine, come save me. You're superb. Sorry, I was only away for a little while. I didn't notice the Leopard Man's attack. Could you give me some Red Wine? I was wondering why you were staying there. Fine, you have it. Only one? That's so stingy. One is good enough to revive yourself. Fine. Ten for you. Go into the castle first. I'll cover you from outside. No. My attack is only 2.1 million. Even if I add 3.16 million with my weapons, I'm still down 340 thousand. Damn it, that was so fast, your calculation. Fine, you can have the Brahma Sword. Yeah. So are you sure about meeting up this Sunday? Then you have to make me your queen first. That's for sure. No problem. Then... Can you take off your clothes for me? Fucking filthy man. What are you doing? There's one right in front of you. I'm out. The gun coil I ordered has arrived. What coil? You mean for revamping the air gun? Yeah. It's at the security booth at my place. Damn, it'd be so funny if your father got it before you. I got to go. Isn't tomorrow your birthday? Fuck that, I know. How about after you're done, you take it to your dad's bedroom, "Dad, if you still want to send me abroad, I'll kill myself right here and now." Stop being an idiot. Me, an idiot? My results were much better than yours, and I still applied for that shitty college with you. Only after that, you told me you're going abroad. That's not what I wanted. I'm off now. Fuck, are you a moron? Why did you have to piss them off? I didn't know it was the Park Gang. -You didn't know? Are you fucking with me? Please. I owe you one this time. -You owe me? You owe me lots of times. This is the last time. When you ask Zheng Yitsang for help, he will make you pay him back. You mean, delivery? Sort of. I want to see Zheng Yitsang. Fuck you bitch. How dare you call Mr. Zheng by his full name? Fuck you too. Go talk to him then. Let's see whose side he's on. Or I will get him to fuck you. Linlin brought Aru to see Mr. Zheng. Should I let them in? Thanks. Are you free tomorrow? No, not tomorrow. How about the day after tomorrow? No, not then either. -How come you're so busy? How about the day after that? The day after that? I can't. Then the day after that? Or the day after that? Or even the day after that? I can't. Bugger it. Jan Wen. Are you sleeping? So we need to take it down and send a new version. Can we take it down tomorrow? (Sheng: How long you gonna be?) (Sheng: You coming home? I wanna go to bed.) Fuck. What's so urgent you need to talk to me right now? I told you I'm working overtime. You want to sleep, you sleep. Stop nagging me. I'll tell you what if you lose some money on the wedding, it's no big deal. Why keep on nagging. Fuck. What are you doing? Was I too mean to you earlier on? (“King's Realm” Game Analysis) (Passionate about ACG, Unhappy about Reality) (Looking Forward to Metamorphosing.) (Jan Wen, what are you thinking?) (Finally free to move on now.) (#3 days to D-Day ) (Are you the Zero they're talking about?) (Please forgive me.) (May Asura's raging force be with me.) (A life for a life.) The most talked about cheat is the app “Bridge to Hades." We're collaborating with Trend Tech's Emo this time, using big data to analyze if players pass the bridge, which would make our advertising more precise. This not only improves player experience, but Brahma Sword sales are soaring too. What's more intriguing is a comic strip has suddenly gone viral, Raging Zero. It resembles our King's Realm game. The characters in the comic are classified by big data. Everything is pre-decided. Only the hero is free to fight against the Big Data Demon and bring people across the Bridge to Hades. I reckon he's an advanced player on King's Realm. So for the year-end ACG exhibition, I'm thinking... I thought I set it to "do not disturb". Go ahead. Didn't I say never call me at work. I've never heard of Raging Zero but the TA of this comic genre doesn't seem to be like ours. Also the so-called Big Data Demon, wouldn't that be like bitching about ourselves? I'm still pitching. -Mr. Hung, let me explain... Can we talk about it tonight. -The ACG expo theme this year happens to be Dark Violence. So that's why we brought up Raging Zero. This mobile phone only goes on the market next month. It's your 18th birthday present. You can use it from now on. I've installed all the apps for you. I'll also register a VIP account at Emo for you. There's already some money in it. I'll wire your pocket money into it. You get a birthday present and there's no "thank you"? Oh, thank you. Also, you're going abroad next week. This fooling around with Axing on the nonsense comics and novels should come to an end. Do you know that people are gossiping that the writer is my son? Are you saying something? Nothing, the novels have finished. It's not that I don't like what you're doing. But you and Axing ended up in that shitty college. I really can't deal with that. It's not like that. Axing's results were good. He came down to my level... -Do you really think Axing's drawings are impressive? Or that there's literary value in what you write? I'm sending you abroad so that you can have the chance to reset your life. Do you get it? There's going to be an interview here soon. What are you wearing? Are they going to be filming me too? You need to get ready no matter what. Don't you have a blue shirt? Put it on like a jacket. I'm not worried about people losing their free will. It is for people who are using the system, instead of being used by the system. Big data is nothing but the traces of people's past. Therefore it can provide the most precise advice, saving lots of our time. And it will always find the best option for us. Our Emo app, (From Emo Secretary:) as it interacts with our clients, (Jan Wen, happy birthday to you.) will discover the thoughts and habits of its users. It can recommend what movie, what restaurant, what travel destination and what college the users should go to. Simply put, we are helping people find their most real selves. So did your father ask you to stay for the interview? No. I wanted to stay and listen to it. I think going abroad will be good for you, otherwise you'll become more like your father. He even gave you that phone. Mommy can go shopping with you too. No, it's okay. Try think of something. Whatever you want I can get for you today. So what about it? Have you thought of anything? Can I... not go abroad and live with you instead? That would be rather complicated. I‘d need to talk with Uncle Chiu. Sure, I got it. I got it. Darling, you knew that... -Xiaoyin is on the stage. He got caught again. He probably came back himself. Bullshit. How long have you been caged? Maybe he's just used to it. What are you up to? Set him free. Are you serious? Forget it. What the fuck? Is that all it does? It seems a lot different from a real one. Maybe I was standing too far away. The steel ball is still inside. Cool, my turn. Hey, what you doing? What are you doing? Why are you so nervous? Didn't you say it only works from a short distance? Fuck. What the hell? It's you who wanted to try it. So we had to try it out. And you wanted to try it on me? What now? Are you upset? I'm not doing it for real. Why the long face? Fine, try on me then. No. Go on, shoot me. It's dangerous. -Then I won't need to go abroad. No. What are you doing? It's dangerous, stop messing around. If you don't want to go abroad let the gun talk to your father then. Forget it. You wouldn't even do it on Oreo. You dare not do anything. You only do whatever your dad asks. That's not true. It's so true. Sweetie, where are you going? Isn't today a school day? I've got things to do. Huh? Things. I said I've got things. That's mean of you. You can't hear me if I keep my voice low. What's with that outfit, are you selling your body? How many times do you have to do this? What? Mr. Zheng said you went to talk to him. You're not selling ketamine again? Zheng Yitsang? You went to talk to Zheng Yitsang? You talked to him again? Are you out of your mind? Has he not hurt you enough? Hasn't he hurt me enough? I was even putin jail. Enough. This is insane. -Why did you talk to him again? I sold my body. I'm fucking selling my body to him. We're short of money, right? You left the “club scene” but you're still drinking. You really pulling yourself together? Damn it. You know what. It's perfect that Zheng dumped you. You end up dying on the sofa one day... No. I didn't mean that I don't want to go abroad. I was just joking with Mom. Yeah. I'll be there a bit later. You go ahead first. Don't make me the main reason for the party. Miss? What the heck. Let's go. The Shining Stone is now mine. Holy fuck. What is this? I don't want to eat with them. What you don't want is to go to the States. Or... come try out the gun with me? You mean on Oreo? Forget it. I'm off. What is with you today? Yeah, I knew that. Go check it for me first. About that lot beside Liming building, when did the land-use zoning change? Yeah, that lot. How are you? Two of the original flavored. Sure. What the hell. I know that construction company. What are you nagging about? Just check it for me. Stop talking shit. I've got another call. Linlin, are you there? Huh? Are you alright? (Oreo that can't escape from the cage.) (18 years old, already fed up) (Something needs to be done?) Hey, man. I've got customers waiting for a table. Sorry. How much is it? $60 It's a gun. What do you want? Watch out. That guy's got a gun. What's going on? What do you want? What's going on? That guy's got a gun. Don't come in here. Have the cops arrived? Have the cops arrived yet? Somebody call the police. There's a gun in his hand. Watch your back. You motherfucker. Fuck you. Fuck you. You run away? Motherfucker. You want to run away? Mother fucking bastard. Fuck you. -Kill him. Enough. -Kill him, fucker. Fuck. -Enough. You're killing him. Stop hitting him. Enough. The cops are here. Anybody call an ambulance? Over here. Step aside, sir. Why did it take so long? We called ages ago. Step back. Step back now. This guy, this guy. He started shooting over there. Loads of shots. You took so long. (Chapter Two: Goddamned Asura) Why have you come here again? Who else would come but me? Does your father come? Or your mother? If you need anything, write down the number. I'll get it for you. Stop being so nice to me, please. It's right of them not to come. You'd better keep your distance from me. Not again. I knew you were trying out the gun that day. I didn't think you were going to kill anybody. A journalist came to question me, I told everything. What journalist? You think you can speak for me? Well, at least, I know you regret it, right? Those dead and injured, you're feeling sorry, too. If it wasn't for your control freak dad... I don't know why myself, so how would you know? I know. If you don't explain it to them, then everybody will misunderstand you. And you... picked the day you turned 18, became an adult. Do you know how big a difference one day means? You're only feeling sorry you didn't try out the gun with me. You just want to make up. I'll tell you what, whatever you say now doesn't matter. We don't have the Brahma Sword, nor the Bridge to Hades. Of course it matters. In our lord, our brother Hu Sheng passed the civil servant exams right after he graduated from college. He was a young outstanding aboriginal talent, and also took good care of his parents. We all knew he was just about to get married. He even planned to bring his parents on the honeymoon, to treat them to a trip abroad. Since the incident happened, have they made any apology? You may go now. We won't forgive him. We're not hoping to gain your forgiveness. But as their lawyer, I'm only here to pass on his parents' sincere intention to reconciliate by way of compensation. That is you two, and even Miss Liao, so that you can go on to live better lives. Vita what do you think? The money is for you to live on later. Sheng and me weren't even married, so I'm not in a position to comment. Vita, don't say things like that. You two were soon to be married. You're part of our family. That's right. Mr. Jen thinks Miss Liao should be regarded as the victim's family. Well, if that's the case... Daddy Hu... Vita, you are still young. Take the money, and you can do whatever you want with it. This is the only thing and the last thing we can do for Sheng. Sorry. We only found out just then too. The designer accidentally put on the password. So we need to reprint the leaflets for the event on Saturday. About the fee... No, Mr. Hung, let's solve the problem first. Can you stop ... Eat up. It will give you the energy to argue. Of course they will be reprinted. I'm truly sorry. We guarantee that... Mr. Hung, I can assure you that we will pay for the extra fee. Yes. We'll take care of it right away. Vita, but a reprint will cost $200,000. What else then? You caused such big trouble and I get the blame like a dog. What else can we do? It wasn't all my fault. Let's see where the mistake was made. Right there beside the Shining Stone. He said "fuck my mother" three times. They didn't proofread it either. Why blame it all on us? I don't want to pay for it either. I want to be a client too. Why do they think I deserve this? You're very good at hiding. Everybody, have a look. There's a moron trying to steal in broad daylight. Hey dude, don't you run away. Let's have a face off if you're a real man. Come on. Are you attacking me? I'm fucking with you. Look at yourself. What a whimp. Whoever calls himself Pooh can go have a poo right now. I'm going back to base to upgrade my score. I really deserve to give myself a hand. (Zero Lin: Are you online?) (Why aren't you replying to my messages?) Is it on now? (Who are you?) Hello, Shine's followers. I'm Sheng's fiancé, Vita. Oh, Sheng is actually Shine. How should I put this? This afternoon, I got a message from someone called Zero Lin. I realized that many of you probably don't know what has happened to Sheng. Shine, whose real name is Hu Sheng, was the only fatality in the killing incident at the night market. Thanks. Now, watching his stream every day since then makes me feel like he's still here. It's kind of ironic that I'm responsible for King's Realm's advertisements but I never played the game with him. I didn't know he had so many followers either. On the day of the incident, I was still working overtime. I didn't have time to listen to what he wanted to say to me. I only remember the last words I said to him. How many times do I have to say it? Stop calling me at work. You're off, but I'm not. Later on, after I got to the morgue, I got a phone call from a headhunter. It was about the head marketing position at a big company. An executive in an advertising company like me always wants to work for the client's company. The person told me although the job requires overtime, the salary would be 20 grand more than mine was. My fiancé is dead. I said, my fiancé is dead. If I hadn't been so busy, if I had listened to what he was saying, if I didn't ask him to wait for me at the night market, this wouldn't have happened. Sorry about all the talking. I used to nag Sheng about him spending so much time in the virtual world. Now I seem to get the point. What kind of shitty luck is this? Somebody was going to make me a queen in the King's Realm's game. And now the king is dead. What the fuck. -The king? The king is too powerful to die. In the real world, not on the internet. He died. He really died. Really dead. Then there are only seven kings left? Wow, you still can do math so stoned. If I'd got the treasure and sold it on, I would've made so much money. Sell them on. Aru. Can you stop being so stoned? You were asked to sell them, not take them. Wake up. Don't tell Zheng I sell for you and take 60%. Once I get enough money, I'm out. What do you need the money for? None of your business. Red Bull Pearl. Shut up. Police, don't move. Fuck, Aru. Get down. What did you throw away? Let go of me. Don't move. -Let go. It'll hurt, don't move. What is this? This is funny? What? -Are we cops funny to you? You haven't finished the Liming building article, so why take on the night market killing incident? You're involved in the case. Don't you feel that in some way I've been chosen to do this article? Chosen, my ass. I nearly beat him to death that night. But I suddenly saw the despair in his eyes, just like my mother had. Sheng, the one who was killed, I bumped into him at the Liming building. I was chatting with him, saying you must have lots of stories to tell. You made me get goose bumps. Continuing his stream is like continuing his life for him. But the real reason why I keep coming here is for something important. That is I want to know about what message Zero Lin sent to Sheng? (So Zero Lin hasn't shown up since?) Yeah. After that last message, she just disappeared. (But can't you sign into Shine's computer?) Oh, I know that. But to see private messages I need his phone verification. And his phone has been missing since that day. (Message: Watch you back.) I've been talking so much I'm about to get killed. I'm so lame at this. Sheng was really good. (Sheng sent you a message.) Sorry, I got to go now. (Sheng: Is it okay today too?) (Zero: You're going too quick.) (Sheng: Your tits are so tiny.) (Zero: I'm still growing.) (Zero: You're so horny.) Miss Liao, long time no see. I just went to the office to resign. Huh? I quit. Oh. Thanks. How did this person get his phone? Who knows. During those last few days, Sheng seemed to have something to tell me. Maybe he was having an affair. Maybe this girl wants to let me know about her. It could be fake. I'm not sure. Back then we were so immersed in our own stuff. We lived together, but our hearts didn't. These are all the toys he collected, and some comic manuscripts. We were thinking of opening a café with a comic theme. So he didn't really want to be a civil servant? Yeah, but his parents thought it'd be more stable. We thought after we saved up some money, we'd both resign and open a shop. But after a while, he got used to it. And so did I. I spent so long at that advertising company. What happened to Sheng has made me realize what I really want. So after all this reflection, have you kind of got over it? Actually, it's not about whether I can get over it. I still have to get on with my life. How are you doing? Do you need anything in there that I can get for you? Sorry. It took me so long to come see you. I thought, just like Dad, you wanted nothing to do with me. It's not that. The media are parked outside. We didn't know what to do. Your dad is kind of a public figure. Didn't he say he hoped the judge sentenced me to death? You know what he's like. He was just saying that. He's got the best lawyer to defend you in court, you know that? The way the case is... there's nothing you can do. You two don't really need to visit me. I'm a cold-blooded demon. I deserve the death penalty. You're not a demon. You're my son. Wen, I haven't given up on you. And I'd never give up on you. Please don't give up on yourself. If I had... got you to live with me, this would never have happened. Or maybe if I'd told you I love you very much... Mom, this is not your problem. If I'd thought about you, thought you would've been devastated, I probably wouldn't have done it. Wen, let me tell you, I will wait for you. We have settled this with the lawyer's help. We've settled the compensation. Once you are willing to apologize, we can settle anything. A life for a life. You think an apology is enough? According to the squid soup vendor, my client, Jan Wen, should then have had enough time to aim for his head or chest. But in the end, he aimed for his leg. Thus it could be argued that my client didn't want to kill anybody. As for the only fatality Hu Sheng, he was at the kebab stall, and moved to the alley to video it. At the time, Jan Wen was nearby and had just shot two victims. Then he walked over to the pavement. (Mama loves you.) At that moment, Hu didn't see Jan Wen until somebody told him to watch out and then he turned around. He's always been a good boy. After we got divorced, he lived with my ex-husband. He has become like his father. They wear similar clothes. They walk alike. If he is willing to confess to his crime and apologizes, I can let go of my hatred. However, we don't see any remorse. In the court that day, I fixed my eyes on him. I thought I would see a bad guy, or at least an evil-looking person. But as I kept looking at him, I saw neither of those. This is a Japanese comic book that Jan Wen loves. I felt like there was a chip implanted in his brain. I mean, implanted by his father. Actually, I enjoy Raging Zero. All its characters are controlled by the Big Data Demon and can't act by themselves. But could big data ever figure out his son would end up like this? I had a son, and I lost him just like that. How can I believe in God anymore? But I have told him if you only apologize in your heart, nobody will know. They want you to say it out loud. That day, he told me to shoot him with the gun. He said that he didn't want to go abroad. If we could start all over again, of course I would do anything for him. Your coffee. Thanks. You got back to work really quick. Staying at home would only mess me up. Is it tough to write? Yeah, it's pretty tough. You said you have to write this article, why? Did you know I wasn't really fond of your fiancé? He was from the urban renewal bureau and we were coming from different angles. But I barely fucking knew him. And that Jan Wen too. I didn't know him either. I've interviewed all the victims' families, as well as the stall vendors. They all just want a quick answer, to get to a conclusion quick. So that society can appear normal and clean, but then what? If I'd been there a few seconds earlier, it would have been me, and I would be dead. If I'd kept on going, I would've been just like Jan Wen and been a murderer. (Fork in the Road of Forgiveness) (The Dichotomy of the Night Market Killing Incident) I don't get it. Why didn't you just apologize publicly? You might've got a lighter sentence at the first trial. How could that be? Those keyboard warriors like to trash talk. They called the judge a dinosaur for not giving the death penalty. But life imprisonment is still like hell. Just like what we did in the comic book, A life for a life. I would sooner rather die. Damn it, what are you talking about? Jan Wen, I'm begging you. Explain this to everybody. What is there to be explained? Just say you didn't mean it. I did mean it. You didn't. How do you know? I just know. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. Holy shit. Your drawings look like you and me. They're not. Stop leafing through my stuff. What the hell? Why are you being so mean? So you're Raging Zero, right? You know what, if I had a gun, I would do it, just like in your comic. Kill all the people that pissed me off. What do you mean by that? My comic is violent so I want to kill people? What? Get out. There's no difference between you and those keyboard warriors. I didn't do anything. Get out. Fuck off. Fuck off. (Did you know Sheng was writing a message to you before he died?) (Stream tonight at 9 sharp.) (I will forward the unsent message to you.) (And I'll even make Jan Wen apologize to you.) Sorry. How much is it? $60 It's a gun. What do you want? What's going on? Mr. Mei, I can't take these. These hearing aids are so expensive. I have visited Linlin. I visited Linlin. She said you don't need to worry about her. (Shine is streaming, watch it now.) (That's so sick.) (This is insane.) (What's he doing?) That's it. So who are you? Is it you that found Sheng's phone? What do you want? It's not the first time this person sent me strange things like that. He also said that before the incident Sheng was going to send me a message that didn't get sent. He wants me to... (I can photoshop this picture too. It's fake.) Thanks everyone for your nice comments. I don't think this is fake. All the complaints about me are exactly like what he would say. That Indian username, are you the one that found Sheng's mobile? What is that link you posted? Is there a virus there? (F@TT EL: Don't worry. There's no virus.) (In 30 minutes) (the police need to bring Jan Wen) (onto this stream) (to apologize to Vita.) (Otherwise) (he will take the place of Jan Wen) (in a public execution) Has anyone called the police yet? (I've called the police.) Fine. Who the hell are you? I don't need Jan Wen to apologize to me. (g@teergT means Goddamned Asura.) (Who is Asura?) The meaning of this username? Okay. That's it. I'm ending the stream here. This Goddamned Asura, I beg you not to hurt anybody. I don't want anybody... (FETT &q7: If you stop this stream, I will show the video of you and Sheng.) What the hell do you want? An apology doesn't matter. Jan Wen's dad didn't do anything wrong. You don't need to kill him. Sir, are you watching this as well? News channels? (Jan Wen's father kidnapped. Jan Wen is asked to apologize.) Don't they have any other news to report? Come out right now. Everybody else face the toilet and kneel down. We're the police. Somebody reported a case and we need you to cooperate. How many people know you want Jan Wen to apologize to you? I've never wanted his apology. It's his lawyer who wants him to apologize so that he can get a lighter sentence. Sergeant Tang, we're certain the suspect hasn't used a VPN, the IP address is right here. Check the residents in this building. Fuck, what number is it? May I ask how do you feel about Jan Wen's father? What do you mean by that? Excuse me, who are you? Left Eye media, Mei, Junzi. I know who Goddamned Asura is. What the fuck? What you doing? Damn it. The left pocket. I just wanted to tell you I know who Goddamned Asura is. Who? Xu Axing. He goes by the pseudonym Star in my article. Isn't he Jan Wen's friend? Yes, that's him. Sergeant Tang, only one minute left. He's not going to do it, right? Don't rush into anything. We have contacted Jan Wen. Please give us more time. Can you hear me? Don't rush into anything. Goddamned Asural Hey you, journalist. Were you saying someone's name? Xu... Xu Axing. Yes, but why? He and Jan... Give me back my mobile. Hurry, the mobile. -I recorded it on my phone. He lives right next to the market. He was there that day. Sergeant Tang, Jan's mother has been kidnapped too. (Jan Wen's parents should just die.) (If you kill anybody, you're no different to Jan Wen.) (All murderers should be sentenced to death.) You know the character Zero in our story, right? Every time she takes out her Brahma sword, she says, "May Asura's raging force be with me." Anyway, I've named the leading character in the comic I've been drawing "Asura", which is really a depiction of Jan Wen. That's right. He was like a pressure cooker. There seemed to be a gust of anger inside him that was going to explode at any time. This username, Goddamned Asura, is from the comic Axing drew a while ago. The best friend of the hero is a murderer that is sentenced to life imprisonment. That's me. The hero is friendly with Asura's parents, so he came up with an excuse, and tricked them to go to a place he's rented. Take a look at Jan Wen's posts and the things he did after that. It's quite obvious that he wanted to get even with you because of your control over him. Wait a minute. When did I ever control him? I only shared life experiences with him, so that he wouldn't waste his time. I'm not finished yet. You're interrupting. Sit down. So in his comic, he drugs my parents, and through the lawyer's stream, he threatens the police to bring me to him. And then? Help me to commit suicide. Help you to commit suicide? I once told Axing, I don't want to be imprisoned for life like a dog. Then you shoot the lawyer and me? That's so lame. No, it's not. This is just to fulfill your wish. It's Asura's wish, not mine. Damn, that's not creative at all. What if I don't really want to die? Then, it's just a comic book. But your father has been shot by Xu Axing. He didn't really fire the gun in the comic book. I'm sorry but he did fire it. Wait. It looks...fake. Where did he get the bullets? What do you mean? Well, if he really fires it, he would be using my pellets. But this is a bullet special effect, just like his comic strip. Hey, journalist, how is everything between you and Xu Axing? What do you mean by that? I've only interviewed him once. Can you please have a chat with him to buy us some time? Holy shit, me? Hey, Axing, it's me, Mold. They already know it's you. Can you please stop the countdown? Axing, you didn't really fire the gun, did you? They all know that too. I know you're doing this because you've got something to say. They're arranging right now for Jan Wen to speak with you. If you want to say something, you can... Axing. Axing, don't. -Shut up. Axing, Axing. Don't shoot yet, Axing. Axing, are you kidding me? What do you mean? You're not kidding. Fine, let me ask you did you revamp that gun? I know you're a mechanical moron. How are you going to help me commit suicide? Why are you undermining my plan? I'm helping you. Bullshit. You always said I wasn't creative enough. Do you think that this plan will turn out exactly the same as the comic? What do you mean? If I don't kill her, will she be badly injured? Hey, what are you doing? I'm not helping you with your suicide. I just want you to explain to everybody why you committed the crime and then apologize. That's very naive of you. No wonder your story sucks. You're forcing me to apologize with a gun. It wouldn't be valid legally. Do I look like I care about the law right now? I just want you to explain to everybody why you committed the crime and apologize. Why don't you just say it? I apologize and then? I did what I did. At least let them know it wasn't deliberate. I know you're only hoping for a lighter sentence at the second trial. But... what does deliberate mean? It seems there's a fine line in everything. Once I crossed it, it was deliberate. Once I crossed it, I became an adult. Once I crossed it, there was no return. I've been thinking if I had gone with you that day and stayed with you, would things be different now? I've been thinking and thinking. If you don't tell me why, I'll be thinking about this for the rest of my life. Don't you know me? That day, I just reached a critical point. I couldn't take it anymore. I forget how it started. However I felt that it was the first time I gained control of myself. But then at the end with that Hu Sheng I didn't intend to... Forget it. As for you, what are you doing this for? Can you hear me? Jan Wen. Police. Freeze. Sorry... ... to undermine your plan. But at least you're okay now. Wait a minute. Don't hang up yet. Jan Wen, you just mentioned Hu Sheng. Why did you stop talking about him? Did you try to say that... you didn't mean to kill him. Does it really matter? Who knows if I really regret it? If I hadn't done it, would things have been very different? If... there's an if. ( Chapter Three: Bridge to Hades) I'm off. What is with you today? I sold my body. I'm fucking selling my body to him. We're short of money, right? You know what. It's perfect that Zheng dumped you. You end up dying on the sofa one day... What did you just try to do? You tried to throw it at me. You're just like those fuckers. (Oreo that can't escape from the cage.) (18 years old, already fed up. Something needs to be done?) Zero Jan Wen. What are you doing here? You still remember me? Cut the bullshit. Since you moved away, nobody calls me Zero. Remember you gave me that name? Yeah. Lin Jialin means zero plus Zero. Your math was second to none, you covered for me a lot. Cut the bullshit, your math sucks. Touching my eraser meant it was A. Then B was... What was B? I forget. I forget too. Have you ever heard of Raging Zero? You mean the comic? Yeah. Shit. Don't tell me you drew it? I didn't draw it. But I came up with the story. No wonder. I felt it was about me when I read it. Zero. Right, Zero. I use the name Zero on the internet sometimes. Really? You come here to shop? I'm meeting somebody at the ice shop over there. How about you? I'm meeting someone too. Do you still live in the Liming building? Yes. Poor people have shitty lives. Not so lucky like you. I'm late for the appointment. I'm off now. Bye bye. It's nice to see you again. Bye. Hey Linlin. Hey. -I'm Mold. How come you call yourself Mold? Don't you find it funny? It sounds dirty. I've been always called that. He's a dickhead. I just met him yesterday. He seems like a naive yet frustrated civil servant. Fuck, really? Do you know the game "King's Realm"? I've been playing with him on that game. If I show him my tits, he will give me treasure. He's even going to make me a queen. The point is that they're not even my tits. They're just pictures I got off the internet. Seriously? -Moron. Do you know what? Maybe I get that from my mother. The violent tendency. You have a violent tendency? You seem alright to me. Right. Maybe it's not a violent tendency as such. It's rage. Rage... Put yourself in our shoes. We live in this kind of community, so we need to collect all the skill items we can. My mom changes boyfriends all the time. Those people fucking suck. Some beat her up. Some even beat me up. Some even feel me up. One of them beat her and made her deaf. Listening to your story makes me think of my mom. Your mom? Do I look that old to you? My mom was abused by my dad. She nearly killed him. No shit? She passed away in prison. I didn't even get to see her before she died. Writing about your community is like writing my own story. Anyone of us could become Asura by chance. But at least for now, we still have a choice. I'm off. Bye. What are you doing? You waiting for me? I'm waiting for your mom. You're waiting for me, cut the bullshit. So what are you doing here? Well... Well well well. You don't still have a crush on me? Well it's just that I think bumping into you today is a message from God. God? I'm not familiar with that. Neither am I. Actually my mom's church is right here in your community. We're doing a meal delivery service on Sunday. I'll be there too. Will I see you again? You mean see my mom again? I can't say. I'll ask her for you. -No, I mean you. What now? Are you asking me out? Well... Well, well. Well what? Let me scan your code. Out of battery. Or you can scan this. Immortal Axolotl? We watched it together. I had it tattooed on me. We watched it at my old home. Or Zero? If I search for Zero Lin, will I find you? You can try. What did you mean by that? You want to break up. No, not really, it's just... Just what? There's no spark now? Keep it down. What are you afraid of? Afraid of people hearing this? If there's no spark, why did you propose? I felt it was about time, and also my parents... And I also feel that me and you are... You and me are what? We don't get on? No. Just like this now. I'm afraid to upset you so I become more afraid of... You know what I've been living with this for the past five years. I didn't know that. I always thought you were being considerate, putting me in first place. Oh, I see. Or are you seeing someone else? No, I'm not. I feel that you don't care for me. Take the wedding, I want to discuss it with you, but you don't have the time. I've been really busy. Didn't I say that you can decide for us? Me decide? Have you forgotten about opening a café? It's you that can't quit such a stable job. Now it's all my problem. I didn't say that. Fine, let's break up then. I'm still hot on the market. I don't need to beg you to marry me. Wait a second. It's always me being busy. That I ignore you, I ignore you? When I go home early, all you do is play games anyway. Have you ever thought of caring for me? Having no spark is my problem. No café is my problem too. You carry on with your dead salary. You don't even pay rent at my place. No honeymoon money, you ask your parents to pay and go together. I'm in stitches. Fucking civil servant. There's no future for you. I hope you get chopped up by a nutter tomorrow. Hello? Yes, I am. When is the interview? When I left, you didn't even come after me. You don't care anymore. I was shouted at like a dog at the office. Don't you care about me? You only care about your toys and manuscripts. If you want them so badly, you come and get them tomorrow. And leave the keys on the table. -Hey. What you doing? Nothing. What are you stealing? Anything missing? No, thanks. Are you alright? Have this new tooth brush and a towel. Also see if any of these chargers work. Thanks. So you're not going to let your dad know? I'm just out of battery is all. Why did you post that you're fed up? We were all worried. Well, I was just expressing my mood. Why is everybody trying to interpret it? Oh, I bumped into Zero from our comic. Yeah? Damn, your dad's calling me again. Just don't answer it. I've made up my mind. Be myself. Don't go abroad. And not to depend on him. Savvy. I'll take the exam again and I guarantee I won't do well so I can be your junior college mate. It must have been fun sleeping here as a kid. You idiot, hold on. If you slept here in winter, it wouldn't be fun. Really? Then I can sleep inside in winter. We'll sleep together then. Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I've been drinking too much. I want to change too. How about I quit drinking? Let's get better together. Jesus said unto them, Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to cast the first stone at her. On hearing this, they lowered their heads and left one after the other. Jesus said to her, Woman, hath no man condemned thee? Fuck, Jan Wen. Jan Wen, who's that? Axing. I thought you weren't coming back this week. Well, I... The semester's just started and I don't have many classes. This is ... That Zero. Hello. Hi. -It's Zero, right? Yeah, Zero. We'll pack up and sleep outside. That's not necessary. I can sleep in the tent. That doesn't sound right. You two sleeping outside doesn't sound right. Thanks then. Axing. The very nice Axing. Thanks. -Zero. Let's go inside. Put on some clothes. Thanks. You're welcome. Why didn't you tell me there was someone else. Hey, Miss Liao. That's such a big box. I'm jumping to another job with a bigger salary. Congratulations. You can hear fine now. Yeah. My daughter got me new hearing aids. Hey. Do you remember me? What a coincidence -Yes, that two of us meet again. I was interviewing her, otherwise we wouldn't have met. You're a journalist? Yeah, I've been working on an article on the Liming building. Let me get a coffee first. I should get you one too. Sure, thanks. Aru. Zheng Yitsang wants to see you. Do you have to write about drugs? What else should I write about then? Community integration rocks? You can just touch on the subject lightly. Lightly, your ass lightly. Assholes. -There's like billions in their business. You really need to watch out. Watch out for what? Whatever, whatever they want. I want to fucking quit my job anyway. (The Dark House of the Minority) (When will the sunshine beam down on the Liming Building?) Is that you in this picture? Of course not. I'm not that fat. But in the article it says that in an internet game, Zero was made a queen. How many bloody queens are there? Why did you lie to me? The treasure you took from my vault costs at least a 100 grand. Do you want to give me back my treasure or the money? Your call. Fuck. What is it? Some dickhead wants to fuck me. You should see what he looks like. Fuck that. I think I don't look that bad. Shut up. Giving a compliment to yourself. Idiot. -Give it to me now. You're so screwed. That hurts. Stop messing with me. You, you're not a dickhead. I don't know how to say this but... since you showed up, a lot of shitty things in my life have seemed to disappear. So I want to thank you. You're my angel. Yes, I do. I want to thank Jan Wen today. Because of him I could have a super power like Immortal Axolotl. My life has changed. Thank you. Actually because of Zero, I began having a positive perspective to see the world. After listening to Zero, it reminded me of a paragraph in Psalm 19. But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults. Keep your servant also... -Axing, get up. from willful sins... -The police said you went on shooting spree. may they not rule over me... -Get out, put your hands up. then I will be blameless... -l was just having some fun. innocent of great sin. -Are guns used for fun? Put on the cuffs. Search inside. Well, it's not real. Wen. -Mom, it's okay. I'll explain it to them when I get there. No, Wen. Don't say anything. Wait until me and the lawyer get there. Thank you. What's going on? Why would Jan Wen have a gun? I don't know. You don't know. You've been hanging out with him. And you say you don't know? I've told Wen many times not to get too close to you. He never got into this kind of trouble before. And that tattoo. Zero Where did you disappear to? How long were you going to hide from me? I'm not hiding from you. Then give back my 100 grand. Give it back? Figure this out yourself. You gave me that 100 grand. I gave it to the girl in the picture, not you. The girl in the picture? Do you think that girl would like you? She never would. Come on. Look at yourself in the mirror. You filthy bastard. We didn't see that in the proofreading. It's not all your fault. Well... (Mold: Check out this news.) just go home to rest now. Let's fix it tomorrow. (Young Girl attacked by Nerdy Civil Servant in Critical Condition) I just interviewed that victim a while ago. Not sure if it's because she tricked your ex-boyfriend. I might visit her in the hospital later. You think you can write, motherfucker. You go on writing then. Think you're tough, huh? Keep on writing then. Fuck, let's go. Watch what you write next time. Mold. What's wrong? I'm in the lobby. I'm going in now. No, I just got out on bail this morning. It looks quite serious. Why don't you stay in a few more days? Don't worry, this won't kill me. Who did you piss off? I probably pissed off the whole world. It's okay. Linlin. You will always be my angel. Because of you, I learned what love is. Because of you, my life has changed. How about you now? Can you finally embark on a different journey to another life? The world doesn't seem to have changed a bit. Nothing can be changed. I once said that you were sent by God. But now I'm not so sure was it God that sent you or... Sorry. Please don't. Sorry, sorry. Wen. Wen, don't. Please don't. Wen, please don't. Wen, don't. (The End) (You video the same thing every day.) (Click!) (The owner will come out soon.) (Oreo, come out!) These were very expensive. Why is your math teacher so nice? Or did you... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sold my body to the teacher, and made so much money. Stop bullshitting. Put them on. Are you going to just look at them or put them on? I have. This is for the right ear. Otherwise how could I hear your bullshit. Report card. Digital report card. Shit, this is so complicated. What is this Math Entrance Exam all about? Nothing, it just means that your daughter is very smart. Which part is smart? So smart. My ass is smart, and my belly is smart. How about your knee or belly button? -Leave me alone. Leave me alone, this is to get into college. Are you on drugs? -After college, I can make money. Are you on drugs? On drugs? I'm not taking them, I'm only selling them.
