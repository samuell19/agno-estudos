Cheetah mum Sia has just given birth to her first litter of cubs. Colchester Zoo curator Sarah Forsyth is there to welcome them to the world. Right, number one. You going to stay still? CHEETAH CUBS SQUEAK SHE LAUGHS Yes, you can tell me off. These five little furballs should go on display to the public in a few weeks' time... ..but the zoo is in lockdown. No visitors means no income, and it's unclear when they'll be able to welcome the public back. Over the last three months, we've had a very small number of staff in. We've had no visitors, and we've completely had the zoo to ourselves. And, for us, we've felt like we've been in a bit of a bubble, you know, we've got our own little family, we're all just seeing the same people every day. We've almost felt a bit disconnected from the outside world as well. Sarah lives on-site, so right now, this secret sanctuary is her whole world. She's taking us into that world, at the toughest time in its history... THEY TALK INAUDIBLY ..as she leads the zoo through to reopening. This job isn't just a nine-to-five job. It is a lifestyle, and I guess it has kind of taken over. I made the choice not to have a family because the zoo and the animals... SHE LAUGHS ..they're kind of my family. All of my nurturing is taken out on the animals. Yeah, the hard work starts once baby's born. I like to watch them growing up, and I like to record them growing up. I've got hyena cubs in here, I've got otter pups, I've got two lots of cheetah cubs, I've got three or four rhino calves that we've had. Sarah established the zoo's successful rhino breeding programme, and baby Lottie is its latest arrival. That's from the security cameras in the zoo, and that's actually just as she's being born. Despite a huge reduction in staff numbers, caring for the animals must go on as normal. Today is going to be the first day that Lottie will have met the giraffe up close and personal. Obviously, they've seen each other for the last six months, but today they're actually going to be in the same enclosure together. Obviously giraffe have got long legs, big feet. And rhino calves like running around amongst their legs and their feet. Even an adult rhino, potentially, if it was kicked by an adult giraffe, it could be fatal. You know, they're huge animals, the giraffe, they've got massive feet, they're very, very powerful. They're gentle, they're not generally aggressive at all, but we're very protective of Lottie, we love her. When we do mix first time, if things just don't go to plan, we're prepared to intervene and separate if need to. The team stand ready with fire extinguishers, the perfect tool to distract a high-kicking giraffe. I can see she's got the devil in her eye already. SHE LAUGHS Is she going to charge after them? Lotts! Oi! Basically a toddler getting under your feet! SHE LAUGHS That's exactly what she is. Lottie! See, I knew she would. Yeah, I'm watching you. Come on! PEOPLE APPLAUD Yeah! The sea lions normally do three shows a day to a cheering crowd. Despite the lack of an audience, trainer Lizzie is keeping her pals ready to perform. SEA LION BARKS That's her killer whale impression! THEY CHUCKLE Are you still managing to keep up the training as often as possible? We're trying to. So, obviously, some staff are on furlough, so instead of all five sea lions getting out every single day, what we're doing is we're kind of transitioning them. So, some sea lions kind of take it in turns. Just so that we get a really good look at them. We've been focusing mostly just on those health behaviours... Yeah, of course. ..and keeping them fit as well. Because if they're not going out three times a day, then obviously they're not using as much energy. And they're losing a bit of their muscle tone as well, we've noticed. So, they are all healthy, but it is still nice to have them do those fitness behaviours, like the porpoising. So, yeah, behaviours like that you still know, don't you, Sydney? LIZZIE LAUGHS She says, "I'm not going to forget that one, I love it!" Do you think she's ready? The moment we can say, "Let's start doing displays again," she's ready to go? Especially with Sydney, she is a superstar. So I definitely think she will be ready for the audiences when they do come back to the zoo. She's very, very excited to see everybody, aren't you? The zoo is making the most of no-one being here and updating some of the animal enclosures. While the work is done, the sheep and goats have been holidaying together in a grassy paddock. Now it's time for them to go home. With the visitors here, we'd have to load up vehicles, we'd have to do it at specific times. It would have to be a well-oiled machine. But Lisa, the head of section, has come up with a brilliant idea of "Let's just run the goats through the zoo - "right from the top all the way to the bottom." So we just run them all the way down past sea lions, down past bears. Right. Left to the lions. Yeah. And then round the back of farm. And they're there. And they're in. Yeah. I think, with enough bodies and encouragement, they'll be fine. SARAH CHUCKLES We don't need to run. It's either going to work perfectly... Yep. ..or it's going to be chaos. I'm going to go with perfect. Good plan. SARAH CHUCKLES OK! GOATS BLEAT Come on then, guys! Watch out. I don't know where they've gone, Lis, but they're on the move. So far, so good! Come on! Come on, guys! Keep going! Oh, look! We were checking for stragglers. We were checking for stragglers! SARAH LAUGHS That would normally take me about an hour to do. I'd split the group up into three or four and put them in the horse trailer, drive them down, let them out, it's about an hour's work. So, that took seven minutes. Today is a big day for a recent arrival at the L'Hoest's Monkeys, where mum and baby have been separated from the group. So, baby's going to go up to vet room now. So we need to formally sex, cos we haven't been able to see if it's a girl or a boy yet, so we'll be doing that. And then we're also going to microchip her as well. So, we have a bit of a thing at the moment with regards to the name. So, we're hoping this is a female, and it's going to be called Sarah, aka Sez, after our curator. MONKEY SQUEAKS THEY TALK INDISTINCTLY If the baby is named after Sarah, it will be the first time she has had an animal named in her honour. I'd like to know whether it is a boy or a girl. I know these aren't the easiest ones to tell, though, are they? No. Not necessarily, but... Yay! It's the news Sarah has been hoping for - baby monkey will be named Sarah Junior. Oh... SARAH CHUCKLES But wait a minute... ..vet John has spotted something! Changed your mind? CHUCKLING: Oh, no! It's a boy. You were supposed to be a girl. Are you disappointed? You've let me down. I've always wanted to work with animals. I guess, as any kid, when you think about working with animals, you think of being a vet. So I did work experience in a veterinary surgery and realised that wasn't quite what I was looking for. Come, Blue. I went to college and studied animal care, and I just did not stop until I got to the position I wanted to be in. Sarah's determination saw her become a zoo curator unusually young - she was just 30. In over a decade in the job, she has never faced a time like this. Come, Blue. So, I think the three months we've been closed, we've already lost millions, and that is what keeps us going through winter. I guess what I've really missed is my friends and my family. I see my family quite a lot and haven't been able to do so during this lockdown period. On a tough day, coming down to an environment like this with this boy is what gets me through. You know, they say animals are soothing, and absolutely they are. And, yeah, I don't know what I'd have done without him during lockdown, to be honest. ALARM BLARES Living on-site means Sarah can be there fast if there's an emergency. There's five of us that live on-site that are basically the out-of-hours security team. And all of our phones are remotely connected to all of the cameras that are on-site and all of the security alarms as well. Rhino horn is worth more than its weight in gold on the black market, and European zoos have been targeted by thieves. ALARM CONTINUES TO SOUND So, we were told that we may be targeted as a zoo, and our live rhinos might actually be targeted. So, instantly that same week, we put a security alarm on the rhino building. Right, well, shutters are all down. ALARM STOPS Sarah's beloved rhinos are safe this time. So, these are cameras directly into the rhino stalls. So, they double up as security so we can see into the building where the rhinos are. They're also very helpful when I have a pregnant rhino, and she's due to give birth. SHE CHUCKLES I can keep an eye on her. I think my first rhino calf was actually, um... We managed to do that through artificial insemination. So that was a huge process. We stayed here every night for two weeks waiting for him to be born. You have a bond with them, it's amazing. And the adults, they are so trusting. I had to carry a rhino calf in from the paddock one year because it was born outside in the middle of February, and it was winter and it was cold. And Mum just let me do it. She trusted me enough with her baby, it was just amazing. It was just, you know, one of my favourite moments, I think of my career, was me walking through the paddock with a rhino calf and Mum just looking back every now and again going, "It's all right, Sarah's got it!" SHE LAUGHS "She's fine." You know, she just let me do it. For three months, Colchester Zoo has been stuck in a holding pattern, with its gates closed to the public. But curator Sarah has just had some surprising news. Unexpectedly, the government has announced that zoos can reopen, and they can do it next week! We've got about less than a week to get ready for opening. We need to open. We're desperate to get visitors back because we need the income. You know, we're running out of money. We need income to be able to feed the animals, pay the staff. So I've now got to go round and catch up with all my heads of section, find out where we're at, how much work we've got to do, and start making some plans to get ready. Hi, Sia. How are those babies doing? Morning. You all right? How are you doing? You all right? How are they? Yeah, really, really good. Yeah, I've just been in and done a quick clean. Starting to hand-feed as well now. Which is really nice. Brilliant, that's really nice. We've now had the news, we can open! I know! So, it's just to start thinking about what we need to do to get ready, really. OK. What? In terms of these guys? Well, no, your section in general. Just generally? OK. Well, there's a lot of grass to be cut and a lot of hedges to be trimmed. Yeah. Public areas are pretty horrendous. A lot of windows to clean, a lot of signs to clean. And, in terms of these guys, we've got their vaccinations to do. Yes, so they are due their first set of vaccinations. No different to domestic cats at home - cheetahs, along with tigers, lions, all sorts of cats, still have to have the same vaccinations you would give your cats at home. And then, after that, they can go out into the main enclosure with Mum. HEDGE TRIMMER WHIRS With opening day just around the corner, zoo staff are returning from furlough and getting busy sorting out 60 acres of park. Obviously, we are so excited to see the gates open. It's going to be quite emotional, cos they haven't been opened or used at all. No-one's been going through them. To see them open and to hear cars coming in and to hear visitors, it's going to be a great day. A big day. It's not only the zoo's gardens that are overgrown... ..after three months of closure, the sea lion tunnel is also looking a little furry. All the time during summer, the algae really does grow, and we've been really lucky with the weather recently. So me and my colleague Kirsty are going to be heading down into the...under the water and we're going to be cleaning all the tunnel, all the windows free from the algae. So, while we're down in the water, the sea lions won't interact with us. They are trained just to go and swim and do their own thing. So, all we'll do is go round, clean the windows, they won't interact with us in these sessions because it is purely to keep the windows and all the acrylic down there nice and clean. Sadly, only four of the five cheetah cubs born in lockdown survived. Getting them vaccinated so they can go on display is a tricky job. Hi! All right. Steady, steady. Steady, steady. So, you're going to grab and I inject, Chris? You're happy with that? Yeah, sure. CHEETAH CUBS SQUEAK All right? So, you can certainly tell these are wil...wild animals! SHE CHUCKLES And this is just... ..a vaccination that any cat would have at home. And it's not painful, it's just a subcut injection. It doesn't hurt them at all, but, of course, they're not used to being handled at all. Ooh, nearly got me. CHEETAH CUB SQUEAKS OK. I know, baby. There we go. All done. OK. OK, Helen. Last one. Hey, Sia. I didn't hurt them, I promise. What happened? SHE CHUCKLES So, we've got four cheetah cubs. Three of them are females, and one is male. Now, the staff are really, really keen to name the male Colonel Tom after the gentleman who raised so much money for the NHS. Now, the three females, we thought it would be really nice to name them with initials of N, H and S. Again, just for us to show our support and our thanks to the NHS for all the work they've done. So, we've done a competition, and we're just waiting to see which name wins, and then we'll have names for our three females as well. 1.3. And then you want six kilos of veg. In the animal feed prep kitchen, senior keepers Ang and Chris are busy sorting out the next round of meals. OK, we've got... An apple, an orange. Chimp. Let's go. OVER RADIO: On my way. The call's gone out that we've got two chimps out at the moment, so the team are now assembling. We're going to be getting our darting gear ready in case we've got a situation where we can dart. And then we're going to be getting ourselves out once we're safe and ready to do so. Chris, I think you go top with your team on foot. Yeah. The foot patrol search from one end of the park... Weapons secure. ..and a vehicle team approach from the other. Chris. OVER RADIO: Sarah. I just got a sight outside Lemur Walkthrough. OK, thank you. We're coming down the main hill. Animal escapes are rare, and, fortunately, this one is a drill. Ooh-ooh-ooh! HE PANTS So, we'll just go straight in with lethal. Yeah. Happy? We have to, every year, take four of these at least to be able to make sure we know what we're doing. Heading towards L'Hoest's. Under the fake fur, keeper Liam is putting on a BAFTA-worthy performance as Angry Chimp One. HE PANTS WOMAN: The bridge. Do you want to just have a quick look that way, check it hasn't doubled on us, Chris? Our plan, of course, would never be to actually shoot at an animal unless we really had to. It has to be the last resort. MAN: Last two sightings out back. There's some noise in here, guys. Ooh-ooh-ooh! When it comes to darting an animal, sadly, it takes a very long time for it to be able to become active. Lemur Walkthrough, and there's noise here. Ready? So, sadly, at that point, we have to take the decision to use lethal force. OK. No, lethal. Ooh-ooh-ooh! One more shot, guys, let's have it. Bang. He's down. That's one neutralised. INDISTINCT TALK OVER RADIO We're just heading down towards train tracks. All right, we'll leave that there, and we'll go straight down. Train tracks. Yeah, let's take it. While the weapons team go after chimp two, Liam has earned himself a banana break. Thank you. There it is. Guns up. Rifle shot. Backdrop. Go for it. ANG: Got it. Down. Lovely job. MAN: Second chimp now neutralised. Everyone happy? Weapons safe? Nice one. Well done, everyone. Thanks, Chris. At last, Colchester Zoo is reopening to the public today. Hundreds of staff have had to learn how to do their jobs in a safe, socially-distanced way. And a single-flow pathway has been marked around the public spaces. A bit of last-minute cleaning, and everyone's ready. This is a very big moment for us. Three months of having those gates closed, and finally, today, we get to open them. So, we're nervous, we're apprehensive, but more than anything, we're just thrilled to be able to open the doors. Look, there's cars wanting to come in! SHE CHUCKLES How exciting! Let's go. Hi! SHE CHUCKLES Hi, guys! CAR HORN TOOTS CAR HORN TOOTS Hi! ALL CHEER Oh, we're at Colchester Zoo, and it's amazing to be back. Mum got one of the tickets to be one of the first to come in. Well, as you can see... BOTH CHUCKLE ..I mean, she's 80 years old, and she's been like a big kid since she's heard. Since she got the e-mail! Honestly. Absolutely, honestly. It looks like that guy touched that guy, so he's it, isn't he? It's nice to kind of start doing a few normal things again. And the zoo was always our go-to place. To realise that the zoo probably came very close to having to close through all of this, and the fact that it looks like they've survived... It's been marvellous, you know. Yeah, it's been very emotional. Absolutely heart-warming, it really is. Confined to the zoo, Sarah has had no-one to give her a hug for the last three months... ..but with restrictions easing, her parents, and brother with his family, are here to change that. SHE LAUGHS Hello, I'm allowed to hug you as well! Isn't that amazing? Yay! Hi! All this time! Oh, it's been a very emotional day. SHE LAUGHS I'm amazingly proud. She's special. She's worked incredibly hard, and I think she's done amazing things. She never balks at anything, she just stands up and gets on with it. There's Lottie. There, you see her in the middle. She's always been animal mad. Always. Ever since she started working in the zoo... ..it's been rhinos. Why is that, Sarah? It's just since working with them. Just, literally, since spending time with them. You've always had an affinity with them. And they like you, don't they? BOTH CHUCKLE You also got them breeding, though, didn't you? Yes. Yeah, you did get them breeding. Cos they weren't breeding, were they? They weren't breeding before, no. Baby rhino Lottie is on display for the first time, and she's still learning that it's best not to annoy the giraffes. Lottie! Lottie! Oi, behave yourself! My mum actually goes and tells her friends that she's a grandma because the rhino calf has been born. Oddly enough, it isn't any of the other animals, it's just the rhinos. The cheetah - all beautiful and lovely. But whenever you send the rhino, you know, it's the rhino grandbaby. SHE CHUCKLES Bizarre. We're obviously as mad as each other! I don't know. Come on, Sia! Finally, the cheetah cubs are ready to make their first public appearance. So, the cubs will stay with us until they're about 18 months old. And then actually they will go to other collections around Europe. And then, hopefully, we maybe go on to have another litter at another time. We're over the moon that the zoo's open. And it's a huge step forward, but certainly we're not out of the woods yet. We just want to be optimistic and look forward. There's things I've had to deal with that I'll take on to future challenges as well, but I don't think we'll ever experience anything like this again. Hope not! SHE LAUGHS I hope we never experience anything like this ever again! Captain Tom's sisters now have their names too. In honour of the NHS, the names chosen for the three little girl cubs are Nova... ..Hope... ..and Star.
