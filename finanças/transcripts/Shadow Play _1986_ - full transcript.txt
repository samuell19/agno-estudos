Jeremy? Here I am. No! Oh. A few good pages every day, that's all I ever asked for. Well you just have to sit there until you get it right, you know what I mean? I've been sitting there so long, my butt's numb, Bette. It's just not coming. Well so get married and have babies. Maybe you need to suffer. Very funny. Oh I hope so. Listen, I told roth it was a scream, and I haven't even seen the first act. You promise me, I promise him, he promises it for November. We are all living on these promises, dearheart. Damn. This is Morgan Hanna. I'm notin. Leave your name, number, and a message if you have one and I'll get back to you. Morgan, roth here. I just talked to your agent. She says the play's terrific, very funny stuff. Then why do I get the feeling she's placating me? Do me a favor, give me a call. Hi sweetie, your dad was worried when you didn't call Sunday. I told him you were probably just busy and I'd check up on you. Call when you can, we love you. Bye. And I have no pride. I'll invite you and you can decline for the rest of our days if you like. But, get you back to the island, I will. With greatest affection, Millie. - You're stuffing your anger. - I'm not angry. - And denying the guilt. - I didn't do anything. And you haven't forgiven yourself for it yet. It hurts to lose someone you love. That's over. I think it's just beginning. Never let him out of your sight. Mother, you don't trust me? Jeremy? Where are you? I'm here. Jeremy where are you going? What dost thou fair fish, full of yon midday sun? Ladies and gentlemen! He walks without a net, a death defying 40 feet. Whoa, to the ground below. The human fly! A serious young woman went to orcas island to spend the summer writing. She met a man who made her laugh and love for the first time. With no warning, he took his life, and something in her died. She fled to New York into the safe arms of her writing. The writing stopped when the nightmare began. The shrink said, "the person you can't "forgive controls you." She had never forgiven him for leaving her, or herself for letting him go. And she never could until she knew why. So go ahead, say it, you think I'm crazy. Now why in the world would I ever think that? Hm? Just because in the space of one week, you drop one play, a brutal little satire on contemporary morals and manners, start another one, uh, close your apartment. You're moving 3000 miles away into the middle of the pacific ocean because you dream about a man who killed himself 10 years ago. Seven. What's so crazy, hm? But an island, for Christ's sakes? Manhattan's an island, mertz. Don't be so provincial. Do you know what we have in Manhattan that they don't have on the north west coast? Everything that matters in life. Crimes, crazies, bad water, lousy garbage service. More shrinks, but... And do you know what they have on the north west coast that we don't have? Trees. And I'm serious, Morgan. They're proud of it. Morgan? - Oh, god. Thank you. It's okay, honey. Whatever you have to do. Keep in touch. Right, psycho. For western flight, 563, departing for Seattle Tacoma international airport. It's been so long. You look tired, dear. I'm fine. Well here you are at last. Your seat also serves as a flotation cushion if it gets too wet back there. John. We've given you the east room, dear, overlooking the strait, it's so restful. I know you'll love it. It's the perfect place to write. It'll be fine, thanks. Mother, why don't we let Morgan be the judge for that, okay? Oh do hush, John, you're such a spoil sport. Uh, did mother tell that she personally financed the painting of the light house? Cleaning up our gothic past. It had nothing to do with our past and you know that perfectly well. The historical society was thrilled. Well. Oh, Millie. I forgot. Place is still the same. Nothing's changed. Except for Zelda. There she is. Zelda? I know youl! Oh! Oh you're taller. Yeah! Just improved posture. She's in love. - Oh. Oh, well I'll have to hear about this. Here we go. Let's take the bags up, Zelda. I got it. All right well I'll start tea. You go ahead with Zelda, dear. And we'll have tea as soon as you freshen up. Don't be too long. Never let him out of your sight. Mother, you don't trust me? Implicitly. It's life that's the sneaky bastard. I'll drink to that. Who? - Your boyfriend. Aw, Tony. He's just like me, half-assed. Zelda, you are not. - Oh, sure I am. He's half-assed, too. Half-assed fisherman. We go dancing and stuff. Well, okay. Okay. You know, I haven't seen you in such a long time, since... Yeah, it has been a long time. Yeah. Well now that I got Tony, um, sometimes I think about how it must've been for you, um, when, you know, uh... - I know. Well, I just wanted to say that. Thank you. - Yeah. Okay. Uh, you know, anybody might think that a person who dies, well on purpose, that he wouldn't love nobody but himself. But I know that Jeremy loved you. How do you know that? Well, uh, can you keep a secret? Yeah. Okay well one day when Mrs. Crown was out, I went into his room and there's pictures and... His room? Yeah, it's weird, huh? Um, she's kept it just the way it was the day he died. And uh, no one goes in there but her. Uh, she says she's Dustin'. Well maybe she is, you know, it's just hard to imagine Mrs. Crown, you know? Dusting? It's life that's the sneaky bastard. I'll drink to that. Sorry. Zelda! Okay. Oh, be careful. Tea. How do you like your tea, dear? With soda. I remember. Feel free to use his room as if it were your own, dear. And if you want any of his things, you just help yourself. I know he'd want you to have them. Oh, Christ. So how are you? No love interests? Oh, lots of interests. It's just the closer I get, the less interesting it is. What about your law practice? About as boring as you said it would be. Oh, god, I didn't really say that, did I? Yes you did. It wounded me deeply, too. Why are you still here, John? Why are you? You cold? - Mm. I didn't know they had writer's block over the rainbow. Bette, the wicked agent of the east, was threatening me with her hoards of flying monkeys, too. I know. What's the matter? The past returns to bruise my mind with all that we once dreamed. With memories of a stillborn love, and nothing what it seemed. For me the year was vivid gold, no shadows hiding sadness. Your parting, secret, swift, and sure, has left the scent of madness. Come on. Come on, Zoe. Come on, dear. Come on. Come on. Very good. Yeah, that's a good girl. Oh. Oh, I know. Morning, dear. Don't you look lovely? I'm sorry, Millie. Sorry? What, dear? I forget that you've been through this twice. I just keep thinking that it's gonna get better. It's been 21 years since my husband died. 10 minute flight to the mainland. I would've been with him. But John had the mumps. He was never very strong. What a miracle that you both weren't killed. Miracle? Not a day passes that I don't wish I'd been with him. Some people are meant to be together. I lack the courage. Last night, spangled and vibrant with promises, hung there between us, then fell away. With a banshee cry, the black magician wrapped all in his black cloak. Breath, and stars, and every promise. He stuffed them hurriedly into his hat, pleading another engagement, and left with his silk scarves after sawing the beautiful lady in half. I need to hear what I'm writing and I had friends in New York that would do it for cheese and wine, you know? Sounds like a job for my theater group. Doesn't it, John? I could get some of them together if you'd like. - Oh, I'd love that, Millie. - Yeah, they're cheap, too. They'd stand on their heads for gallo red and velveeta. Lois, right? - Lois. Hi, Millie! - Oh my goodness. This is conray, he's our sirino. Sirino's nose, you have not seen a nose like this. - Hey, you're the playwright? - Oh, and Sarah. - Hey, this is good. - Sarah, this is Sarah. Have you decided on a last name? Starr. - Starr? With two r's. - With two r's. But I haven't really decided yet. He's just passing through. Yeah, I'm over here trying out for the Vancouver canucks, but I can always use an expert. Doesn't he talk cute? Archie, how are you? Oh. - Pretty good, love. Excuse me? This is a play for several voices, but, the voices aren't really independent characters as much as they are facets of the same character. Why don't we just read into it and then you can ask me questions afterwards, if you'd like? And I hope I'll have some answers. Um... Sarah, you wanna take it from the top of page one? Sure. The last night... Spangled. Um, you know, sprinkled with bright things. Yeah. The last night spangled and... Vibrant. I'm a dancer. It's okay. Um. The last night spangled and vibrant with promises. Hung there between us. Pause. Then fell away. I think your ribbon's a little too tight there, Sarah. I'm only kidding ya. Want me to take it? What, I'll do number two? Yes. - Okay. Now? Yeah, thanks. Okay. With a banshee... What's a banshee? What's a banshee? It's... it's a supernatural being whose wailing warns of an approaching death in the family. Oh, terrific. Yes, thanks. With a banshee cry, the black magician wrapped all in his black cloak. Breath and stars and every promise. He stuffed them hurriedly into his hat, pleading another engagement. And left with his silk scarves after sawing, after sawing the beautiful lady in half? Um. Okay, we'll try it again. And I know they dreaded coming home for summer. Well, there was nothing to do, except check out the tourists. Tall girls, short girls. Round ones, thin ones. I thought they were all horse meat. God, I remember bunky. Or spunky. What was her name? She had the biggest cassavas and the worst case of hay fever you ever saw. Hello Mrs. crown. It's such a pleasure to meet you... Oh, god. Every time she gasped for breath, that great bosom of hers Rose and fell like a freighter on the high seas. And then you came. It's the first time they ever agreed on a girl. You wait, embalmed in a victorian parlor, for grieved relations to say good bye. But, what if I find the body has warmth? That time can only magnify. What does it mean? Oh, pig of the evening, wilt thou be mind and snort in the mud with this horny, young sow. Oh, it does not, Jeremy. You are so rude. What does it mean? I have a strange and exciting dream... About an unknown woman whom I love, who loves me. I'll see you later. Shh. On. Hi, Mrs. crown, you're up early. Well no, actually see, I haven't been to bed yet. I've been out all night in the bushes with a boy on a bicycle. Yeah. Do wash your hands before you start breakfast. In sleep, I am awake once more. A slight of hand I have perfected to dream in color every night. Primary colors, primal heartbeats, tearing at my senses, softening my shell. The taste of you is on my tongue again, and I will graze 'til morning. Yeah? I'm sorry to bother you, dear. I'm going to see Byron tonight and wondered if you'd like to come with me? He's quite fascinating, you know. Oh. Well, thanks Milly, but I have to work. Well, if we don't talk with you, we'll talk about you. Those are the ground rules, you know. Well then I throw myself on your mercy, but I am enthralled to the muses and they are, by god, calling. May I? Yeah. The taste of you is on my tongue again, and I will graze 'til morning. My god, how wicked. What is this? 1 wish I knew. Well never you mind. Byron knows all. Ooh ooh. Oh no. - Now, now, don't say oh no. You don't know what is is yet. Well whatever it is, I'm sure it's too much. I couldn't resist. They looked out of the shop window in Seattle and said oh. Byron wants me? - Byron wants me. They lied. Well the shop lady said that all eastern mystics have them for luck. It helps foretell the future. Oh Millie, these beautiful creatures will bring good luck only when they can fly free. This is the significator, Morgan Hanna. We seek her path. This covers her. Hm. Danger. This crosses her. An alliance. This crowns her. Violence. Not necessarily. Fate. Perhaps fate. God, you scared the shit out of me. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. I uh, couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd drop by and check out the action. Ha, not a minute too soon. You can watch me boil water. Shouldn't Millie be back? It's after 11. Oh, no. For mother and Byron, the night is yet young. What? Well you see I'm afraid mother has a secret vice. Byron? On. Yeah, he's a man to be reckoned with. He has, um, friends in high places. What places? The great beyond. A psychic, really? Morgan? Please tell me again what he told you that evening. Morgan. I've gotta hear it John, to make it real. He said there was a kind of despair, I think he said, at the very center of him. See, he never really got over dad's death. I remember when he was little, he always used to say he had a hole in his heart where dad used to be. I think everything he did was in an effort to fill it. He loved you. Too much, he said, to inflict it on you for a lifetime. And he didn't know if he'd ever have the courage to tell you. How can it be humanly possible that I wouldn't know? Why would he have to find courage to tell me he was in pain? This is her nature. Hm. Things that are happening now will turn into something better. Good. Oh, good, very good. This is her house. Great change. This is what she hopes for, and fears. Perhaps an end to something, new beginnings. This is what has yet to come. Isn't she? Jeremy? Where are you? Here I am. No! Now? I wanna show you my bowling trophy. Your mother's downstairs. She's already seen it. You don't bowl. I wanna show you my poetry, and nobody's seen it. My god, don't you ever throw anything away? That's what I like about you, you're such a sentimentalist. You got something for me? What dost thou fair fish in the full of yon midday sun? Have ye not been warned it will dry up thy tail? Perhaps if I but bring tiny parts of the sea to thee it will caress thy sorry scales and save thee from the heartbreak of dry skin. But no. It's too late. Dry skin comes creeping, even as we speak. Haste. Make haste. - Jeremy. Save thy splendid tail! We need one of the newly engaged. After all you can't all three get married. Come on John, over here. Ah ah, aye. - Let's take one together. You ready? - That's it. Oh, for heaven's sake. That's so funny. Look right in there, good. Now let's see that ring. Let's see the ring. - Oh. Jeremy, where are you going? Ah! Ladies and gentlemen, he walks without net, a death defying 40 feet. Whoa. The human fly. Jeremy. Please. Let me see it. It's bad luck. I'll bet you're just afraid I won't like it. You'll love it. I'll love you, all my life. Promise? Damn youl! The taste of you is on my tongue again, and I will graze 'til morning. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. 1, I saw that the light was on in Jeremy's room and I thought maybe you had, uh... Oh, I, I uh... Oh, Zelda. I think I'm losing my mind. Hey, hey. You're as normal as I am, huh? I've seen him here. I've seen him here. Why don't you lie down? Close your eyes. Now Mrs. crown admires geese. She thinks they're somethin' special. They mate for life, she says. And if one of them dies, sometimes the other one just dies of a broken heart. We got one goose around here already, if you ask me. So I'm gonna stay right here until you go to sleep. I'm okay, Zelda. Really, you can go. You sure? - Yeah. Okay. You want me to take this? No. - No? Okay. Now, I'm just right next door. You call me. 1 will. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Do you know where we're going, Jeremy? To the edge of the world. Used to come up here when we were little. No matter how hard the wind blew, it was safe in the light room. The night they told me dad had been killed, I tore up here. I just knew they made a mistake. Some boat would pick him up and follow the light home. I waited and waited. I feel more alive up here than any other place in the world, you know what I mean? As if I'll go on forever. But I don't want to if you aren't gonna be there. I'll be there. I bet you say that to all the boys. You come to me again still spangled, honey soft smiles, electric eyes, that send their charge to warm my cold belly. I am awake now, but still dreaming, and cannot locate sleep's soft boundary. And so I cross it, unsuspecting, pursued by the black magician's cry. Hello? So, what? You fell off the edge of the world? I thought you were gonna call me the minute you got there. Sorry Bette... I should say sorry. Do you have any idea the polka that I went through to get this number? I mean what is it with those people up there? They don't speak english. They didn't understand a word I said. We are talking primitive, Morgan. How's the play? I'm forging ahead. Well you sound ecstatic. I sound tired. Fresh air, it's exhausting if you're not used to it, you know what I mean? Hello? Yeah, I'm here. You haven't said three consecutive words. Sorry. Why don't you come home? I can't. I'm writing, finally. Listen, babe. I'm only gonna say this once, and if you ever quote me, I'll call you a liar. But there may be more to life than writing. Not for me, Bette, not now. You come to be again still spangled. Yours. Honey soft smiles, electric eyes, that send their charge to warm my cold belly. I am awake now, but still dreaming, and cannot locate sleep's soft boundary. And so I cross it unsuspecting. Pursued by the black magician's cry. Great. Good. That's good. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave, Morgan. My shift with the grandkids. Well, it's late, isn't it? Sorry. Well, thank you. Thank you all very much. See you tomorrow. So, what do you think? Well, uh... Oh, help, you hate it. No, no, no, I don't. I just... They'll hate it in Kansas. Come on, can I buy you a drink? Uh... Just a minute, I have to lock up. Oh, Archie. I thought everybody had gone. Hey. That's powerful stuff you're writing there, you know. Oh you like it? Yeah. I do. You're one very interesting lady, Morgan. Even that name, Morgan. Where'd you get a name like that? My ancestry's German and I was born in the morning. Morgan. You know what think? I think me and you should get together. You do? Yeah, you know, I mean why not? We're both free, white, and 21, aint we? Well, two out of three isn't bad. Aye, you think it bothers me you're older? Nah. I like that. Mature women are so much more understanding. No, Archie, it bothers me that you're younger. Immature men are so much less interesting. Hey, I'm very interesting. Ask Sarah. But I haven't been free in years. But I can set you free. Just give me a chance, Morgan. You're like an exotic bird in a cage. You just need someone to show you how to spread your wings. Goodnight, Archie. Come on, rare bird. Let us fly from this here joint on gossamer wings. Hey, big j. How's the honey? How are you doing Marty? I didn't know you were leading a double life. How's it going? - Can't complain. See you caught yourself a little fox. How's this? You want a beer? - Yeah. A couple Henrys, Marty, all right? Coming right up. Don't worry. Drop your g's and the aliens all appear very friendly. Ah, that's great. Thanks. Oh, do you want a glass? What's the matter? You won't believe it. I don't even believe it. Why don't you try me? Some very strange things have been happening to me since I got here. I believe that. I'm sorry. What? What things? Supernatural things. Oh boy. Mother will be thrilled to hear it. I'm serious, John. Either... Either supernatural things are happening or I'm a raving psychotic. I've seen Jeremy. Or his reflections, at least. Every time I turn around, there's nothing there. And last night when I went to his room, I found lines from my play in his typewriter. I don't know why I'm writing this damn play anyway. I mean, out of nowhere, I'm writing this freeform bullshit. It'll be a commercial disaster. They'll laugh me out of the theater. But I have the sense that everything depends on my completing this play. Morgan... First of all, it is not so amazing you see reflections of Jeremy around here. I mean, nobody's every really let him die. We all sense his presence. You know, you read those lines of his years ago and you stored them away somewhere and now, now in the creative process, you remember them exactly the way they were. Yeah. Actually, it's a very common phenomenon. But I don't write poetry. Well you certainly do. And it's exquisite stuff, and it's yours. Excepting the stuff you grabbed from Jeremy. Hey. Come on, let's dance, huh? Dance? You've been listening, I may be committed and you wanna dance. Well statistically, demented women make very good dancers. Besides, you ever hear of dance therapy? No, I haven't. Well, claimed to have cured cancer with it. Bullshit. No honest, they have. Think what it would do for brooding. Come on, come on. Show me what they do in New York. J so can you give me a reason j j make me see why j j show me the rule that says me and you j j can't make beautiful music tonight & j beautiful music tonight j j so can you give me a reason j good night, Marty good night. Thanks. Now you have to admit my dancing has improved a little. Can you boogey? - Sure I can boogey. But I wouldn't. Well you're such a sloth. Yeah, yeah, I know. J tonight j j beautiful music tonight j come on back in. - No, it's too cold. Oh, it's not cold. It's like bath water. Remind me never to take a bath with you. It's Jeremy. It's Jeremy. - Morgan. There's nothing there. Morgan. What do you want? I'm here. Shut up, I'm here. Don't go! You don't want him to be here. Morgan! Come back here! Millie? Millie? Come on, kitty, there we go. There we go. Are you all right? What happened? Are you all right? Is everything all right? Where were you? The pool. Together? I mean, it isn't heated. Coming back here has been very hard on Morgan. I think she's close to a complete break down. Don't exaggerate, John. - I am not exaggerating. - She just arrived. Naturally, there are memories to be lived through. It's bound to be upsetting. She's not just living through her memories. She's living in them half the time. She thinks the past is directing her future. What's so unusual about that? Hello? Dr. feldman, oh I'm so... I'm away from the office for 10 days, but I'll get back to you as soon as I return. Leave your name and telephone number at the tone. Mother. You've... We've both lost a lot. I know how much you wanted Morgan to come back to us, and I know how much you want her to stay. But she may have to go. The shadow man came with satin sheets and tea, talking easily of magic; Trick rabbits, and rings. The shadow man came with satin sheets and tea, talking easily of magic; Trick rabbits and rings. He knew the precise location of sleeping and waking, and drew me a map to prove it. But as I slept, I lost the north from the south a bit, and he could not follow me there, though he tried. For he loved me, in his way. There was a story in his eyes I tried to read, when the sun was high, but he disappeared, only to return when shadows fell over the windows of his past. Come in. Hello? Well, well, what a surprise. Come in, come in. I knocked at the house but nobody answered. I'm sorry, I suppose I should have called. No, not all. I knew you were coming. Well tell me what I can do for you. Dear me, I will read your mind if I must, but I'd rather we have a little conversation. I'm sorry. It's just that I really don't even believe in this sort of thing. Neither do I. You um, have a reputation as a... A sensitive. A sensitive. Yes. And you'd like a reading? Oh my, is that really what you call it? Oh lord, you remind me of a 16-year-old boy in a massage parlor. Come along, we'll go to the house. You have questions. This will light our way. Should I have returned to the island? This is a question without an answer. Each soul will inevitably find its own place where it should and where it must be. Will I finish the play here? I see a completed manuscript. Yes. Am I losing my mind? Hm, you're experiencing the apocalypse, which precedes great change. Why do I feel Jeremy's presence so near? Souls that once were intertwined may reach out after death. Why didn't he reach out before he died? Perhaps there was no time. Time. The body may die in the space of a heartbeat. The soul, if it's troubled, may linger until at last it puts things right. Hi. I uh... Through the looking glass, cold and unforgiving, she watched the night come riding. He had lightning in his hands, to force the night against its will, and bend her like a moth to flame. With medieval magic, he crossed the perilous kingdom, between the world and its reflection. Morgan? Good morning. I uh, came thinking I should say something, but damned if I know what it is. Don't. Don't say anything. It wasn't what you think, John. Oh, well... What was it? I don't think I can talk about it right now. Morgan, please. I've gotta talk about it. I remember what it was I was going to say. I love you. - Oh, no. No. No, don't talk to me, don't love me. You don't understand at all what's happening here. Excuse me, but I think I do. We made love last night. I have wanted you from the first moment you arrived. I wanna take care of you. I wanna make love to you again and again... No, you didn't. You were here, but you weren't real to me. Oh, don't you see, John? It was Jeremy again. I saw him and I touched him. I've made love to him hundreds of times! God, don't you know how crazy I think this is, but Christ, it's happening! It is not happening! It is only in your mind! Goddammit, I can't believe this. God, all our lives it was Jeremy this and Jeremy that, and now seven years after he is done, he's still captain of the basketball team and you're the goddamn cheerleader! Oh, Morgan. On. Oh, Morgan, I'm sorry. Oh Morgan, Morgan. He came, another face and voice, to make the strange familiar. But in his touch, it was revealed what wizardry could not conceal. It promised ecstasy at last and pleaded ride with me, ride with me through the glass. Ride with me. Ride with me through the glass. I love you. Jeremy? Jeremy? It's Jeremy. Yes. Come to me. I'll always love you, Jeremy. No. No, no! Morgan? Morgan? Mrs. crown? Mrs. crown? Morgan? Dear? What's happened? I cut myself. On the mirror. Go get something to clean her up. Well, I know a good temper tantrum when I see one. They're good for the soul. Byron would say we must trust the unconscious. It knows what is best for us. I can finish the play now. I know how it ends. You can. You can. Zelda? Up here. She's up here in her room. Thanks for calling me. - Yeah. It's weird. Mother, I wanna talk to Morgan alone, okay? Hi. Zelda says you're finishing the play. Oh Morgan, what have you done? We've gotta get you out of here. I'll go with you. I'll take care of you until you feel better. But I do feel better. Just to know it's nearly finished. And I am going. But you can't come with me. Now you just try and stop me. I can't tell what's happening. I mean, I wanted her to have come for him, but now, I don't know. Byron? I don't wanna be alone. I see you beckon from afar with promises anew. I hear the black magician sing, and I will follow you. Then I'll meet you there with plenty of time to get to the last ferry. I think it's very generous of you to take time with the community, how shall I say, players? I wanna hear it all the way through once. Okay, Dorothy. But then it's back to oz where you belong. I'm not going to oz, John. I'm going home. You bet you are. Hi, Morgan. Hey. - Bravo. I'm leaving tonight and I wanted you all to know how much I've appreciated your willingness to help me with the play. Some of you know what a difficult birth it's been, but, the child has arrived at last. Shall we read? Mother, I'm sorry. I know, I know. I just wanted everybody to be happy. Happy here? Mother, there is so much of the past here, it's just driven her mad. Morgan deserves a chance at the future. So did Jeremy. You stay out of this. You don't know anything about it! Jeremy had everything a man could want, and what did he do? He killed himself. There's more life in the dead than in the living around here. John, no! She belongs to Jeremy! - Millie! Wait. Let him go. Prisoner of my reflections. I tried to touch my keeper. And in that dark and liquid night. I met me own ends, reaching. To loose the ropes that bind us. Let our sails billow wildly. Twinned faces, parallel places, came together in the glass. I'm so filled with longing, to pluck the future and the past. I see you beckon from afar, spangled as the last night, now with promises anew. I hear the black magician sing. And I will follow you to the places we have known and the dreams that we have sewn, to watch them flower in the night. Take me, then, as I do you, and in that bonding, find release. Come. Know the truth that holds me here. I wait for you. And peace. And peace. Well Morgan, you know, if you didn't like it, we can change the lighting. We have some gels. You were extraordinary. I'm going now. I have to meet someone. Oh hello John. You just missed her. What do you mean? She said she was gonna meet you. Meet me? Well, where? She didn't say. Well what exactly did she say? Well she said she had to go now 'cause she was gonna meet you. Eh, not exactly. She said she had to meet someone. Someone, yeah. Oh, please Morgan. Please don't do this. Goddammit! The body may die in the space of a heartbeat. The soul, if it's troubled, may linger until at last it puts things right. I'm here. Here I am. Morgan! I'm here. Here I am. Morgan? Morgan, come with me. Morgan, no. Morgan, listen to me. Morgan, Jeremy wouldn't want this. Look, he loved life too much. He didn't leave you. You didn't fail him. It isn't you he wants. It's me. I'm here! Here I am! Oh, god. He didn't take his life. Champagne all around. I love you. Jeremy, go home! Look, will you just go back to the party? Hey, come on, come. Get out of my way! Yeah! Oh don't be a bad sport. I'll let you win next time. Come on Jeremy. Let's have a toast to the two of us. Hey, where are you going? Come on. Hey come back in here, you bum. No, you won. Come on, get out here. John. - Come on. A toast. Face to face, man to man. Easy, big fella. Okay, okay, okay. Are you happy now? To life. Oh, no, no, no. To the best man. No, no. You're the best man. I'm the groom. No, no, no, no. You're the groom and the best man. I don't need to be here. John. No. - Jeremy, let go! And the important thing is that oh, we'll try to get it to off-off Broadway and we'll hype it as the product of a fertile but temporarily fevered talent. Hey, babe, how do you like that one? Is that a great angle? Yeah, that's it. People like that in their writers, you know what I mean? Everybody but agents, yeah. Anyways, the point is... The dream is done, and so am I, except his reflections in a lover's eye. To you, the future, take the sky, the sun, the stars, and fly, and fly.
