Brother, a few days ago the river flooded and drowned some villages we were lucky to escape from it We've nothing to eat and no place to live and don't know where we should go You knew that the river would flood so you shouldn't be living close to the river We've been living there for several generations Brother...

Yes, I heard about it too He's a real life-saver The eight hundred victims who fled from the flood have all been well taken care of The life-saver came down from heaven and put down over a thousand taels of gold and disappeared in the clouds Yue Lai Inn Waiter Coming... How much will that be? Thirteen cents, thank you Waiter This is the Huang Tung Town Yes Is this the Yue Lai Inn?

You want to eat without paying, I'll beat you up You're a young fellow why don't you learn to be good? We're a small business If everyone were like you then... It's not that I don't want to be good Only if I hadn't played the role of life-saver I wouldn't have to eat without paying Boss I think this kid has no money at all let me beat him up Got it Look at these two swords they're very sharp and could be worth some money Let's make a deal These swords are worth some money I'll leave them here with you and redeem them when I have money We have no use for such weapons Let me see They are good swords, trust me Would you sell them for 10 taels of silver? Waiter Looks sly, wants to eat for free he won't pay even if he has money If you want to beat me do it now Sir, you must be joking How do I dare? I didn't think so Thanks... Thanks... Had I known it couldn't be retrieved I should have asked for 100 taels of silver I've lost in this deal With a swift horse I'll still make it Coming Brother Choy Miss Jiang, go quickly Brother Choy Miss Jiang Is Chief Jiang alright? You are not worthy to ask about my brother I swore once anyone from the Wei Sheng security bureau would be in trouble if they ran into me There'll be one less every time one sees me But Miss Jiang... I could show some mercy Hey, don't bully the young lass She'll cry soon Good You know I have no weapons and gave me a sword when we met Leave quickly One more strike and... you'll be shamed Damn kid, we'll meet again We'd better not if we did, you won't just go bareback Brother Choy... Don't cry... Miss You're beautiful but you look awful when you cry Makes an unsightly scene I'd rather die than see you cry It's no use pretending dead Miss, you can't bring anyone back to life You'd better not cry But I'm heartbroken Brother Choy treated me very well Right you should be sad and being sad you should cry But the one who treats you well doesn't want you to be sad either So you need not cry Let's make a bet, shall we? On what? That you'll not cry See, there are three dices I'll throw them If all happen to be red, don't cry Look, you lose Don't cry when you lose You've got to be tough You wouldn't look nice when you cry What's your name? Wandering Swordsman What about you? I am Jiang Ning Siao Ning Ji You've saved my life How am I going to repay you? No need to thank me But since I'm going after someone you can lend me your horse That's not good You're alone, you might get into trouble I'd better take you home Where's your home? It's very far away At Henan I'm here with the security bureau I've asked my Brother Choy to take me out but unfortunately we came across Jin the robber Let me take you back to the Huang Tung Town Good Siao Ning Ji There are two things which you should not do again What are they? First, don't go with the security bureau again There are too many bad people in the martial arts world Second, don't cry Let's go Huang Tung Town Siao Ning Ji, I've to go after someone I can't go with you anymore You... You want to cry again Maybe I've to fake being dead again Miss Jiang Where's Brother Choy? Brother Choy... was killed by a robber named Jin Miss Jiang, hurry back to the inn This is a serious matter Chief Huang has to decide on this. Let's go Huang Tung Town Inn The single sword swordsman, Jin Li Loi Miss Jiang, do you know where the hero who saved you has gone? He said he had to go after someone The goods we are escorting are worth a lot The news has been leaked out someone might rob the goods So Chief and us go separate ways to distract those robbers He will arrive a day later It was unfortunate that we came across Jin Li Loi Jin has seen only me and doesn't know that we are escorting the goods Last year at the Shan Gan Road Jin Li Loi and his gang tried to rob the goods and four of them were killed by the Chief He was the only one who escaped This time if he's alone I can still handle it but if he's got help... Chief Huang let's wait for another day and set off when Chief arrives How can that be? If something is to happen... it will happen; we might as well set off in order not to cause suspicion Chief Huang We've looked around and haven't found anyone suspicious But last night the Shum family at the neighbour town was robbed After that the two men ran away by separate routes even the security head could not arrest anyone This is the work of the Flying Robbers of Ji Dung The Flying Robbers? Guo Tien Wan, Fang Tien Lung It's them If they and Jin Li Loi are of the same gang then... Chief Huang, if someone is going to rob the goods ...there must be some indication I think it is just a coincidence No need to over react I just hope that the Chief will be here soon Let's resume our journey Let's go, we've finished resting Miss Jiang You've been exposed you can't stay with the group I'll leave two men behind you stay here and wait for the Chief Alright You two stay behind Yes Stay out of trouble Yes Let's go Go Sir, please... Go in Do you see? See what? The troop of carts Yes That's our target Brother Kung The carts are filled with fruits what use do we have for them? They put up a good front but they can't fool me That's the Wei Sheng security bureau's escort inside these carts It's the valuable goods Then what are we waiting for? It's not yet time I want to wait till we're sure to succeed Yes, your nickname is 'Fail-Safe' You make a move only if it's a sure-win The strange thing is I haven't seen Chief Jiang Wei of the bureau I bet he has the most valuable stuff These carts might be just a cover I have a way to find out Go in front to the Hou Jiou gambling house at Yien Shia Pu & await me Yes Gentlemen, have you seen someone with a three-sectioned staff and with a thick beard? Gentlemen, I'm talking to you Get lost... leave us alone What's the matter? How come the people at Yien Shia Pu are so unruly? We are not from Yien Shia Pu Good scolding Besides, I'm not a local And anyone is surely the grandson of one's ancestor Hey There's no need to get so mad Are you leaving or not? I've lost so much, I'm steaming I am prepared to do anything now and you still dare to bullshit me here Go There's a gambling house in front Right You'll never have enough money to bet at the gambling house of Hou Jiou at Yien Shia Pu They are cheating in gambling Don't bring it up even the capital for the small business is gone Get up... It's no use just sitting here My money is borrowed How much have you lost? 3 taels And you? Two and a half taels I bet on a small number but they opened a big number Here are 9 taels of silver Go and do your business Remember, if you are no match to other don't gamble again Wait It's not that I don't want to give but I must leave some Yien Shia Pu Hou Jiou Gambling House Get lost and don't make trouble here What is it? You've lost & didn't leave, & want to create trouble? Beat him What are you doing? None of your business It wasn't supposed to be but I have come here to have some fun with this money But you guys look so fierce that I dare not go in Is there another one close by? None within a hundred miles He wants to create trouble after losing in gambling We must teach him a lesson That's right I'm different I can win all your money Yes... please... Brother, don't go. They are all swindlers You will surely lose Even if you win they won't let you go That's a trap Damn you You like kicking This bastard is talking nonsense, he must be kicked I like talking nonsense too I say people always cheat in gambling Try kicking me too Thanks for rescuing me This is not a proper place for you to stay I am different. I like trouble This is the strangest thing on earth A gambling house preventing punters from entering Get me some chips Eight taels net Place your bets... Come here those with heavy bets Quickly Excuse me Place your bets if you want to get rich Wait What's the matter? Nothing. For starters I'd like to examine your dice to see if it's loaded Nonsense If I were speaking nonsense what's the big deal letting me look at them? Alright, examine them Looks okay Wait I hear the Hou Jiou gambling house is honest It's really true Only eight taels of silver Place them on twelve Fix the bet on that Place your bets... Place your bets... Open All red three, four Twelve, I win Twelve in total Small, lose and Big, win Twelve wins The odds are one to sixteen 8 taels of silver become thirteen and six Come, place the bet on twelve again Good, let's play in style As it should be Place your bets... Open Oh, three red again Twelve again Thirteen six become two hundred seventeen and six Dice rollers here are seventeen six as tips two hundred taels are enough for me Thank you Still place the same bet? Yes Still twelve Oh? Two hundred fixed on twelve Stop that noise... Oh? Three red again I win again Three thousand and two hundred taels Waiter, get someone honest and carry the silver for me Master Jiou... Right, they say people always cheat in gambling your dice is loaded I'm not playing anymore Not playing? Of course not your dice is loaded everyone sees that I'm no fool, why shoud I play? Your technique is good considering that you're here despite being blind I'll reward you 8 silver coins to get out of this place What do you mean by this? 3,200 taels of silver, not a tael less If you don't have enough silver, gold will do instead 3,200 taels Take this Attack... Come on Oh, Heaven tiles A pity, such a coward Gone before the money is taken Sorry, Master Jiou 3,200 taels of silver Please issue a payment note I want it issued from a reliable bank Quick, write the note to this young master here Hurry Go Quick... give it to him Have a few drinks I've won it Brothers Bother Kung instructed us to wait for him at the Hou Jiou's gambling house I believe brother Kung has come to wait for him Yes But someone was causing trouble at his gambling house so it's unwise for us to show ourselves lest they suspect us and ruin our plan You two can spend the night at the inn Alright, let's go Yien Shia Pu Go Chief Huang we have been disguised as peddlers If we continue our journey through the night it might arouse suspicion that's why I've loaded our carts with fruits These are perishable items which have to be gotten rid of as soon as possible so that others won't be suspicious Chief Huang, how thoughtful of you! Let's go Huang Tung Town Inn Here's the wine Since you've been around in the martial arts world have you heard of a knight named the Wandering Swordsman? No Aren't you Miss Jiang? Miss Jiang, haven't seen you for seven or eight years You've grown up a lot You haven't seen me for so long of course I've grown up I can't always be eight or nine years old But I still recognize you Where's your brother? It'd be nice to be able to see your brother again Brother Wei... Stop shouting, my brother isn't here He's not here? Your brother is my best friend where's he? He may be able to make it here by this time tomorrow Who are you? My name is Kung Never heard of it Chief has a friend named Kung Naturally Chief Jiang has made a lot of friends He must be here tomorrow to meet you all Yes, he... Hey, what are you trying to find out? Miss Jiang, I have to do that If your brother is anxious to meet you here then he won't have the treasure with him He just wants to distract others I can surely succeed if I rob him before he arrives Oh, so you are Kung Wu, the 'Fail-Safe' That's me He's mentioned earlier that he is Kung Miss Jiang, he's the security bureau's nightmare He's Kung Wu the 'Fail-Safe' a robber who specialises in robbing security bureaus This is called 'Fail-Safe', understand? Take her away Go That's bad... someone's got killed Hurry and report to the authorities This is the end, I won't be able to open the shop Please Tie her up Brother Jin Have your men heard about news from Jiang Wei? Yes. Unicorn, speak I went to the Wei Sheng security bureau and followed them I know that Jiang Wei and Chief Huang left Luoyang City together with the goods Then... I followed them to the east of the city and at the junction Jiang Wei and the others split up Jiang Wei rode south Chief Huang travelled east They all dressed up as peddlers Brother Kung the treasure should be with Jiang Wei No, I knew this already Jiang Wei will catch up with Huang's men tomorrow If he has the treasure with him he wouldn't have to do this They must be escorting the goods in secret Jiang Wei wanted to distract others so he took a short-cut in order to meet them and set off together Then we... We'll rob him before he joins Chief Huang This a such a good opportunity But brother Kung there's a damn kid from nowhere Even Fang Tien Lung and Guo Tien Wan have been defeated by him Looks like this kid too is following the treasure We have to watch out You're right. I'll be more careful Of course Brother's nickname is the 'Fail-Safe' Unicorn, you stay here and watch the girl Don't let her run away Yes Let's go to the Yien Shia Pu Alright Bought my knife for ten taels of silver Guess it's a good deal for you to keep it several hours The silver in the bag is mine It's quite heavy All crows are black All silver is white How can you tell they are yours? Got your name on them? It will answer you? Stand aside What's your name? Jung Sz Hu You should be called Mian Hu (mushy) Bullshit First it was deep-fried, now you were hard boiled no wonder you look so mushy Want something different? How about frying? Add in some seasoning too Let's attack him together It's you I forgot All those I have defeated are here Bloody kid I don't want to mess with you please excuse me Brother Kung, it's him Good skill I've told you not to create unnecessary trouble and mess up proper business What's this all about? Brother Kung, I must kill this kid I must skin him I want to cut off his hands to ease my anger That's easy to say What has he done? He used a dice filled with mercury and cheated me 3,200 taels of silver He hung me on a tree and robbed me a thousand taels of gold Brother Kung, look he poured oil on me Then splashed me with hot water and robbed my bag Brother Kung Stop fighting, we are together Are we? I don't know your sister If I had a sister who knew a knight like you she is indeed fortunate You are too kind But it's unfortunate that a person as skillful as you is a gang member of the Unicorn Clan Bullshit I suppose you guys are bastards from the Unicorn Clan If you are not from the Unicorn Clan why are you helping them to go against us? Bullshit There's no point arguing with him Kill him so he won't be in our way That's right You said that you have business to attend to what do you want to do? We six brothers are known as the Six Heroes of Da He It's a pleasure to know you You are all heroes They may be rough and did not pay attention to formalities But you cheated, robbed and steal You are not that good after all We're equal You come all the way to go against us Looks like the Unicorn Clan has already known about what we are going to do and has planned to make a fool of us Stop saying that I'm connected to the Unicorn Clan You may be right You are such a young hero You shouldn't be like them doing all sorts of evil deeds But... I've got it You guys want to take advantage of the Unicorn Clan Is that right? The Unicorn Clan has great influence and align themselves with the government bullying the people The six of us are unable to fight them but have heard that they have recently succeeded in robbing some treasure and will send to the Capital to bribe the authories A certain Chief Huang is responsible for the delivery We are not keen on the treasure but the river flooded recently and drowned some villages How sad! So we want to rob that treasure as a relief to the villagers which is much better than spending it all ourselves Good, that's wonderful To tell you the truth we will do it before dawn If you have no connection with the Unicorn Clan please do not obstruct us What's this all about? How can you keep me out of this? Please forgive us We don't even know who you are This is a matter of importance My name is the Wandering Swordsman To tell you the truth I've robbed this guy of a 1000 taels of gold and have given it all to the refugees Then we share the same belief My name is Kung Bi Yau If you wish to join us I'll have to ask my other five brothers Come over and greet this hero We didn't know each other before and I apologize for any offence that I've made Don't mention it... Those people from the Unicorn Clan are foxy They knew that someone will be after them on the way So they disguised themselves as peddlers We have speedy horses Please go with us and catch up with them before dawn Good Please Someone is hiding in the forest, everyone be careful Chief Huang, your Clan has great influence why do you have to dress up like this? Chief Huang? Stop pretending We are the followers of the Wandering Swordsman and are coming for the treasure Grab the treasure, don't harm anyone I've told you not to kill Get lost Don't keep anyone alive otherwise they will report and we'll be in trouble Rubbish How can we kill indiscriminately! If I did that all your men would be dead by now I ask you... Congratulations You have great skill Chief Huang is a bad guy You'll be famous for killing him Be careful The treasure must be there somewhere They are all here Look This treasure is worth at least thirty to forty thousand taels of gold Many refugees could benefit from this treasure Oh yes? We have fought so hard and should have some reward Hero, if you take this people won't look up to you Alright I hope that you'll give them all to the refugees Goodbye Take care of the dead men and the carts and don't leave any trace Yes Go Hurry and go, hurry... Miss Jiang you know that I am in trouble Miss Jiang, we are in trouble Chief Huang is dead the treasure has been robbed Really? Miss Jiang, the chief will be here soon let's go to meet him Let's go to meet my brother I'll go to someone who can help us Miss Jiang Who are you trying to find? He must be at the Yien Shia Pu His name is the Wandering Swordsman Wandering Swordsman? He was the one who led the bandits Rubbish Miss Jiang Is the Wandering Swordsman you're talking about very young and carrying a pair of short swords? Exactly That's him I don't believe it... Miss Jiang, where are you going? To look for him No need to follow me You go to meet my brother and I'll go and find the Wandering Swordsman Hou Jiou Gambling House Tidy up, hurry Don't be afraid Where's Hou Jiou? Master Jiou went out when he heard someone shouting on the street and never came back Really? Really didn't Honestly Master Jiou said there was no need to pack up Come over I said come over Yes Where's Hou Jiou? He went through the woods in the east and took a short cut to the Huang Tung Town What did he say? He said he wouldn't come back and there was no need to manage the gambling house Let me ask you There's a guy named Kung who was with Hou Jiou Who's he? He's Master Kung The famous Kung Wu, the 'Fail-Safe' The 'Fail-Safe', Kung Wu? Yes He said he was Kung Bi Yau the 'Fail-Safe' Wouldn't that mean he's sure to get what he wants? Good When they arrived at the Huang Tung Town where did they go after that? I don't know Prepare a horse for me Yes, there's one outside Wandering Swordsman Siao Ning Ji I've business to attend to, see you next time Wandering Swordsman, don't go Siao Ning Ji, what's with you? You... Siao Ning Ji, don't cry Don't you remember you look terrible when you cry? You took a gang to rob the Wei Sheng security bureau and killed Chief Huang Goods from the Wei Sheng security bureau Chief Huang... Tell me you didn't do it Tell me it wasn't you, not you Siao Ning Ji Chief Huang was escorting some treasure and he disguised himself as a peddler That's correct, you didn't do it It wasn't you, was it? No, Siao Ning Ji, it was me You... Don't be excited I'll get back the treasure for you You... you are a robber You can't get away with it Stop Chief, it's him He's the head of the gang, the Wandering Swordsman Chief Jiang? You robbed the treasure, didn't you? Chief Jiang, I have just parted with your sister and I've promised her that I will recover the treasure before sunset today What are you talking about? I must recover the treasure Hmm, an internal dispute Your gang members took the treasure away, right? Whatever you say If you trust me, wait for me here Don't stop me Why should I trust you? If you do, you'll get back the treasure Don't trust him, Chief He was the head of the gang Friends If I had not kicked your ass so hard at that time and made you fly off a long way you would have died by now You led the gang to rob the treasure naturally, I'd look for you Chief, Miss Jiang is here Sister Brother He robbed the treasure Who's he? The Wandering Swordsman So damn hot Wait until Brother Kung comes back with the currency You won't complain about the heat while holding a girl in Yi Shiang brothel at the Luoyang City Brother Kung is great With just a few words he could convince that kid to help us rob the treasure Six Heros of Da He What a good name! I'm afraid that kid still has wool pulled over his eyes Who is it? Brother Kung is right You are all here That's right Brother Kung asked us all to wait for him here It's hot, do you have any cold water? There's a well at the courtyard Go and get it yourself Where's Kung Wu? Speak Alright Brother Kung is waiting for two people at the woods They are from the Unicorn Clan They are carrying the gold for our booty Hero, spare me I have to take care of my eighty year-old mother Eighty years old already How strange mothers are always eighty years old How come they can't be seventy-nine nor eighty-one Brother I know where he is Their hiding place is in a house outside the Huang Tung Town There's a pumpkin yard in front of the house I was locked up by Kung at the house and managed to escape at dawn That one is Iron King, Jung Sz Hu; And... He's one of the flying robbers of Ji Dung, Guo Tien Wan The single swordsman, Jin Li Loi The foxy Hou Jiou This is Fang Tien Lung, one of Ji Dung's flying robbers That's weird It's been rumoured that the five of them are followers of Kung Wu, the 'Fail-Safe' How come they've got a new chief called the Wandering Swordsman? Just the five of them Chief Huang is no match for them I'm too careless I thought I could escort the treasure safely by using a diversion Too bad it has turned out to be otherwise Brother There's someone by the name of Kung who pumped me with questions I said you'd arrive a day later Oh? All the treasure is gone! It'd would be disastrous if the treasure could not be retrieved Brother, look How come these people died here? It doesn't look like they were killing each other They were stabbed by short sword The Wandering Swordsman... Chief Just now some people in town saw a man covered with blood and bandaged his wounds with his dress He rode on a horse and sped toward the woods I figured that guy must be Wandering Swordsman He's wounded That's good How long ago? I've asked about it too It was about an hour ago Brother, we... Let's go after him Looks like the Wandering Swordsman is going after someone too He may be chasing after Kung Wu, the 'Fail-Safe' He robbed the treasure but he said he would help us retrieve them Don't believe in him If he hasn't got the treasure they must be with Kung Wu Let's chase Yes Chief Wen the 'Fail-Safe' may be here Yes Brother Kung... Brother Kung... Kung Wu, come out Hello, Chiefs Have you succeeded? I'm nicknamed the 'Fail-Safe' Once I make a move, it's sure-win What are these? Pearls, Jade etc. Any one of these is worth over thousands of taels of silver Have you got the money order ready? A hundred thousand taels of silver is too cheap You could double the profit re-selling the treasure Of course I've got the notes with me Show us first See that... Yes... Brother Kung We'll do a fair exchange Put the treasure on the fan The Unicorn Clan can bully others but not me Double the profit by re-selling the treasure What? You want to kill us all Chief Wen We'll call off this deal You want to die in this forest? Chief Wen don't blame me to be cruel Just blame yourself for being too merciless Brother Kung If you don't retrieve your hand I can cut off your right hand just to be sure Do you believe? Yes... Go over Brother, let's talk about it you can have all the treasure Of course I will Hurry... But Brother Kung... We have to sort things out Please speak... Why did you get me involved in this? Well... You have been fighting against Fang Tien Lung You are highly skilled I thought you wanted to have a share of it so we might as well get you involved Good idea What a nice plan No wonder you are nicknamed the 'Fail-Safe' You wouldn't kill me, would you? What do you think? What about it? I've lost. No luck Nothing more to say Good It's good that you admit you have lost Kung Wu Miss Jiang All that treasure is among the grass I suppose it's all there Go and get it Brother, it's all there Although it's rotten luck I can still recover my loss You... Wandering Swordsman... Siao Ning Ji Is all the treasure there? I'm so ashamed I... I have been deceived by others You are seriously wounded Don't cry You look beautiful but not when you cry Looks so terrible I'd rather die than to see you cry Alright, I won't cry Stop pretending to die Wandering Swordsman... He's dead No... he's not, he's pretending He doesn't like me crying He said I look terrible when I cry Wandering Swordsman, I won't cry Look, I'm not crying Bring his body to the Huang Tung Town Brother, I'm not crying He didn't like seeing me cry I won't cry again
