[woman narrating] This is a picture of the American dream. This is a picture of what the dream once was. This is a picture of what the dream has become. At the center of prime-time television has been the selling of the dream. And at the heart of the dream, the mythic American family. Once an outsider, the African American is now part of this family, part of the myth. Through television, if nowhere else, we are now watched and welcome in the majority of American homes. But what was the key to the households of prime-time America, the key to our inclusion in the myth of the American dream? [gunfire] [cheering] [woman] As Blacks returned from a war that they fought to give other peoples freedoms that were not allowed to them in their own country, Blacks became more determined to... get some of what I gave my life for. [man] I think the mood in Black America after World War II was cautious optimism. The military had just been integrated, you know, as a result of that war, and allowed Black soldiers in. On the other hand, I think there was still this caution about racial hostility. [woman] There was a great deal of anticipation on the part, not only of the soldiers returning from World War II, but as well on the women and men who worked in the defense industry during the war. They had had opportunities that had been unavailable to them prior to the war because of the demand for their labor. So that you had a highly trained ex-military class... and then you had people who were formerly domestics, often, who had experienced industrial life, so that they were poised for life fully in the 20th century, a life that had been experienced by other Americans but which, of course, had been denied to Black people. [crowd cheering, clapping] [narrator] Our optimism after the war coincided with the celebration of a new, infant technology in America. [dramatic fanfare playing] [announcer] After ten years of experiments, the public at last gets a preview of television. [playing lively waltz] [narrator] Race relations and television formed a critical link. [announcer] And so a new industry steps out of the laboratory into the limelight, as television makes its bow to the American public. Where it will go from here is any man's guess. [waltz ends] The white man, the Negro, the Oriental, the Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew, they've all shared the spotlight on this stage. Well, Danny, if I may inject, that's the way show business operates. Danny, there's no room for prejudice in our profession. We entertainers... [Gray] Television in the early days was a medium trying to find itself. It was a medium that was perched to really make a difference, but the kind of difference that it could make was really to be proven. The format of radio at that time was you had, you know, the evening programs, dramatic shows, westerns, comedies. So television was a natural extension. They just took those ideas and brought them to pictures instead of sound. [TV audience, viewers laughing] And to that extent, then, I think Black folks' representations in television were very much inherited from radio. And, of course, that gets us into the old Amos 'n Andy sorts of situation comedies. [Amos] You know, of course, that there's a shortage of women. [Andy] I'll say. The one I took out last night only come up to my belt buckle! [laughter] [Gray] And, of course, in radio, it was two white characters who came up with the idea and who impersonated Blacks. Who's scared? Me? Ha ha ha! [Gray] And by the time it came over to television, of course, they had to assemble an entire Black cast. If you don't give me my money back, I'm gonna punch you in each eye! Then I'm going to punch you in the mouth. Then I'm going to take a stick and crack your head! In other words, I'm gonna open everything that's closed, and close everything that's open! - [audience laughs] - Take it easy, Andy! [man] Well, to say that The Amos 'n Andy Show was popular in its day is a shocking understatement. It was enormously, indescribably popular, and also, indescribably primitive in its use of stereotypes and clichés. It's about time you met some decent people instead of that horrible, uncouth group you associate with. Well, I done met all the accomplished people I wanna know. Like Andrew Brown, for instance. Yeah, like Andrew Brown. Well, what, may I ask, has he ever accomplished? Well, he, uh... Just yesterday, he had a run of 13 balls in the side pocket without once leaning on the pool table. - [audience laughs] - That's exactly what I'm talking about. Andrew hanging over a pool table. You'd never find him in a public library. No, they ain't got no pool tables in there. [Leonard] A composite of all the clichés about lazy Black men and about opportunistic Black men. In those days, it was taken for granted that the portrayal of characters, as they chose to portray them, was audience-pleasing. And we're in the business of pleasing audiences, so we did it. At home, it was very important that we not watch Amos 'n Andy. It was very important to my mother that I should not see something that was so racist. Why, you ain't got sense enough to come in out of the rain! I is too. I's done it lots of times. [audience laughs] [Carroll] It was years later that I realized that Amos 'n Andy are brilliant. They were really funny. Andy! Now, ya see, Andy, first, the atom splits into what they call the monocle. And then the monocle busts and breaks down into what they call neutrons, "po-trons," Fig Newtons and morons. [audience laughs] [no audible dialogue] [narrator] The struggle to end Jim Crow segregation and the portrayal of Blacks as second-class citizens inevitably took television to task. Hi, partner! Here, Andy. Hold this. [Gates] When we think of this group of people whose historical experience had been transformed by the war, poised for full integration into the American society, and then we think about what they were greeted with as television made its debut, they were greeted with images of a fully autonomous, segregated, separate Black community, which was the community in which Amos 'n Andy thrived. Quiet, please! [narrator] The first prime time television show to feature a Black cast, Amos 'n Andy played on a familiar theme. Blacks might aspire to the American dream of success, but we were continually, comically ill-equipped to achieve it. [audience laughs] Why couldn't I have been a doctor like you two guys? Because there ain't no uniforms that fit you. Just shut your big mouth and come on! [narrator] Even before its premiere, the show was sued by the NAACP to block its broadcast. The suit charged, "Every character is either a clown or a crook. Millions of white Americans see this Amos 'n Andy picture and think the entire race is the same." Oh, no, no, Andy, I don't think you — So that the interests of the Black community and the images fed to that Black community, and to the larger American society in the early 1950s, were diametrically opposed to each other. [narrator] Two seasons after its debut, Amos 'n Andy was canceled. The nation was heading toward a new era. Yet television for the most part, throughout the '50s, failed to adjust. [upbeat orchestral music playing] In the cultural landscape of prime-time America, Negroes remained in their place. Biaku, Wanaba. Jambo, jambo, bwana. Hold it, Mr. Erwin. Something's gone wrong! [stammers] Watch it! Watch it, Willie! Oh! Whoa! - Whoa! - Oh, Willie! I don't think that the sponsor or the network, and certainly not the writers, ever considered the questions of race relations, of stereotyping, et cetera. That was the farthest from our minds. Uh, again, what we were trying to do was to present an amusing set of characters in as amusing a background as we possibly could, doing amusing things to entice that audience to come back next week. [orchestral music playing] [announcer] The Beulah Show, brought to you by new milder Dreft, for dishes and fine washables, and deep-cleaning Oxydol for the family wash. Starring Louise Beavers as — Beulah. If marriages are made in heaven, my guardian angel has sure been loafing on the job. [laughing] I think Beulah was popular because she almost idealized what every person would love to have in a housekeeper. They thought, "God, if we could get a Beulah to run our house, this house would be much better off than it was." [phone rings] The Hendersons' residence. This is Mrs. Harrington... [narrator] But in this idealized dream of the American family, what of Beulah herself? Would she be better off? Gosh, Beulah, I'm gonna have to dance in front of Mom and Dad and everyone. That's easy. What's bothering you? I just can't dance! Well, that's easy to fix. I'll teach you. Jeepers, Beulah, can you dance? Can I dance? Donnie, when the beat's right, I just take off! [lively piano jazz playing] [Rolle] You make her so happy in it... and you made her so unaware of her own children and so aware of somebody else's children. That is a Hollywood maid. I knew a lot of people who worked as domestics... and I know people who had to educate their children from their earnings as a domestic, and they did it because they didn't want their children to go through what they were going through. Noble. That's nobility. [narrator] The nobility of our historic dream of freedom and the dream of race relations in early television continued to clash. But most of '50s television retreated from the conflict. [Dragnet theme music playing] [man] My partner's Frank Smith. The boss is Captain Norman.

And a freezing system all its own. We were rarely part of this mythic picture. Through the late '40s and '50s on television, it's as though Black people didn't exist. You know, night after night, there were programs, and occasionally we'd have a superstar as a guest. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Diahann Carroll. [slow orchestral music playing] ♪ When a bee lies sleeping ♪ ♪ In the palm of your hand ♪ ♪ You're bewitched... ♪ [man] Somebody would yell or we would know through the grapevine that some Black person was going to be on television that night, and we watched it. The rest of it we didn't watch. There was nothing that related to us or we could relate to, so we didn't watch it. I can remember my mother and my aunts and my neighbors, if they heard that a Black person was going to be on television, or if they saw one come on the screen, they would dash to the phone and start calling each other, so that the neighbors and the aunts wouldn't miss it. My mother wouldn't call long distance on the phone if there was a death in the family, but she would call my sister far away to tell her that she'd heard that Cicely Tyson was going to be on a program, for example, because it was such a source of pride for them, for that generation, for my mother's generation, somebody who'd grown up in the '30s and '40s. There was such a void in the magazines and on the radio, so rare to see African American people depicted anywhere, that it was a treat for them.

It wasn't so much rooted in comedy. Well, the composer of that song, who was so widely unknown 14 years ago, is our guest tonight. And here he is, my good friend Frankie Laine! [audience applauding] [woman] Nat King Cole, I think, appealed to a broad spectrum of people because he didn't seem threatening. He didn't, um... He didn't seem forceful or belligerent or anything that would make, say, white people uncomfortable. [lively orchestral music playing] [Carroll] I think that many... um, of the minorities involved in this profession during that period are guilty of something that, um, we had to do for survival, and that's called adjustments. We had to make adjustments in our mind constantly in order to stay away from the area of anger and, uh, "What's wrong with me?" [upbeat jazz playing] [Henry] As a man who wrote, produced and directed this television show, the feedback I would get occasionally was that he had wide acceptance in the white area because he was a gentleman. I'd hear that a lot. They said he was the kind of guy that you could welcome into your home. He was just a gentleman. [narrator] If any one Black performer of the time held the key to prime time's family of entertainers, the key to inclusion within the American dream, it was Cole, the model of assimilation. [woman] ♪ I ♪ ♪ Got a home in that rock... ♪ [narrator] But was this enough to pay the price of the ticket? Would prime-time America open the door and welcome him in? [crowd chanting] Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to integrate! Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to integrate! [man shouting] Why don't you tell the niggers to go home? [crowd clamoring, hooting] [Turner] In 1957, the same time Nat King Cole was on television, Black children in Little Rock, Arkansas are trying to go to school and meeting with a great deal of resistance on the part of the white political structure that is supposed to enforce their rights. [upbeat jazz playing] [crowd clamoring] [man] Don't stop! Just keep coming! Don't allow them to teach the niggers! King Cole was very threatening. "How dare you bring a Black man into our homes and into our communities with white guests, no less, with white women, no less, with white men, no less." "They're trying to go to our schools. Now look. They have a television show?" [Turner] So it became impossible for the producers of The Nat King Cole Show to find a sponsor willing to underwrite that program. They did not want to alienate their Southern constituency. [audience applauding] - You're beautiful. - You too! I had fun! [laughs] [narrator] The reality of race relations had reframed television, making an otherwise acceptable image taboo. Unable to find a national sponsor, The Nat King Cole Show ended after one season. I think it was Sam Goldwyn who once said, when he was criticized about some of the — why he didn't do shows of a more sociological import, he said... "If I want to send a message, I'll call Western Union." Uh, the networks, the sponsors, they just want to get good ratings, high ratings. High ratings — good for NBC and it sells product. 'Cause ultimately, let's face it, television is a commercial industry. The society moves like this and television moves a little behind it all the time. It's never gonna lead it. It's always gonna follow it. Because it's a sponsored, uh, medium. [announcer] Just out and just wonderful, the 1957 Chevrolet. [Wolper] The theory is when a sponsor advertised a show, it's to sell the product, period. He doesn't care what — You can put a test pattern on. If a lot of people will watch it, he'll put his commercials in it. So that if somebody feels, by putting a commercial on a television program that has some controversy to it — this is early on in television — it may affect their product. They didn't buy anything with controversy. Broadcasting cannot continue to live by the numbers. Ratings ought to be the slave of the broadcaster, not his master. You must provide a wider range of choices, more diversity, more alternatives. It is not enough to cater to the nation's whims. You must also serve the nation's needs. [crowd shouting] [narrator] The networks were predictably slow to take up this challenge in television entertainment, but in the prime time arena of public affairs, the civil rights movement provided a golden opportunity. [woman] ♪ Wade in the water ♪ ♪ Wade in the water, children ♪ ♪ Wade in the water ♪ [Gates] Precisely in this period, the images of Black people dominated the news, and they were images of, on the one hand, Black men and women being tortured and beaten and abused and whose rights were being systematically violated. On the other hand, there was a certain nobility of spirit, and no one knew what to do with Black people in terms of representing them in a TV series. [Martin Luther King] So this afternoon, I have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day... [woman] There was so much possible. And there was, at the same time, so much fear and so much violence. And out of this pressure that was brought to bear by the civil rights movement on the structures of the South particularly, um, there was the potential for a new day, and everybody knew it because it was on television. ♪ Let my people go ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ Over the hills and everywhere ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ To let my people go ♪ ♪ Who's that yonder dressed in white ♪ ♪ Let my people go ♪ ♪ Just like the children Of the Israelites ♪ ♪ Oh, let my people go ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ Over the hills and everywhere ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ To let my people go ♪ That was a turning point, an important turning point to mobilize and get the sympathies of whites who started to see the brutality, who started to actually see the deep resistance to essentially Black enfranchisement into the society. And I think the spillover that it had was to at least raise the question of absence of Black representations on television, or at least raise the question of to what extent did television have some responsibility to try to participate in this opening up of the society. Chuck? Chuck, we've got some new neighbors. [theme music playing] [narrator] One of the most provocative series of the early '60s was East Side/West Side. Stories were set in a variety of communities, each dramatizing not America's dream, but her nightmare realities. I told you, there's no jobs! [baby crying] You hear something? It's just the baby crying herself to sleep. [baby screaming] - [man] Ruth! - [baby continues screaming] [screaming] [baby wailing] [horns honking] Taxi, stop! Hey, you! Hey, hey, cab! Hey, stop, will ya? Come on, stop, man! Hey! Hey, cab! Man, will you stop over here? [narrator] There were no neat resolutions in the show, no happy endings, no sentimental songs or canned laughter. What do you mean? In one episode, the show even challenged the unspoken assumptions behind American integration. Oh, come on, now, he's a perfectly nice old man, but — But you wanted a white Negro and you got a Black one. The Negroes have a right to move in under the Constitution. The only thing is, what kind of a Negro? I'm telling you, he isn't the type for this community. What if he were white? Come on. A rough, uneducated, decent sort of a guy who made it the hard way. A guy who could never be your particular friend. Is that any reason for keeping him out of here? We have a different yardstick for measuring a Negro, don't we? If he went to Harvard... if he plays golf... if he looks like a Boston gentleman and talks like a Philadelphia lawyer, why, fine, let him be brown. Only not too brown. Yeah, your husband believes in equality... but — Mr. Adams is the "but." Neil, I — No, no. I'll see you around. [narrator] Boldly bucking prime-time convention, the show repeatedly undercut the myth of American progress. East Side/West Side was canceled after one season. [crowd chanting] Still, prime time was faced with adjusting to the continuing civil rights struggle. Could TV entertainment address Black life in America, yet still sell success, the good life, the American dream? [announcer] The look of success, the feel of success, the power of success. A luncheon I attended in which Mr. Roy Wilkins spoke, and he spoke to a large group of Hollywood writers and producers and directors and made a pitch for gentler treatment and more aware treatment of Blacks in all media. The end was always to be the inclusion of the Negro American without racial discrimination... [Kanter] And he really shook up that audience. ...equal in all phases of American citizenship. And I left there saying, "There must be something I can do." [theme music playing] [Kanter] I thought that I really owed to my Black colleagues some sort of an apology for a lot of the things that we had done on Amos 'n Andy. Too bad you didn't get back earlier. You really missed it! - Missed what? - Dr. Chegley has finally... [Carroll] Hal Kanter created an environment that was new. So he created this young lady who was a nurse, who had a family and an education... and she lived in an integrated environment. - Well, how'd it go? - It didn't. I tried, Marie. But with Brenda, you have to turn her off first. However, if there's anything you'd like to know about flamenco... - [fingers snap] - ...just ask. [Carroll] She didn't present a picture of being either overly grateful or overly subservient. She felt she belonged there. We'll just have to figure out some way for me to tell her. It felt like a step above the, uh, grinnin' domestic... who had to be very stout, very dark, preferably with large eyes and a wide grin. And I guess we were... tired of being so inundated with that imagery that we accepted Julia... as a breath of fresh air. I think that we were very one-dimensional in many areas. [Carroll] She was — Listen, she was the perfect mother. - Did you brush your teeth? - Yes, ma'am. Good. Brushing your teeth wakes up your mouth. - And now you can eat breakfast. - Mama, why are... What we had to do, I think, was to... find a kind of acceptable area that broke down some barriers and then we were able to move on from there. - Hi! - Hi. [no audible dialogue] [soft piano music playing] "Man who hath no music in himself..." "...is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils." Greetings. That's your assignment. That man. [theme music playing] [gunshots] [Gates] We all watched I Spy. I was 15 at the time. I couldn't wait to watch it. He was my hero. He was a Rhodes scholar. He was so articulate. I mean, so much more articulate than his sidekick, Robert Culp. Race was not a factor. These were two men. There was male bonding occurring there, loyalty, friendship, love between the two. And it had nothing to do with whether one was Black or the other was white. Listen, we've been through a lot together. - Haven't we? - I guess. I pulled you out of a lot of close shaves, haven't I? Yeah. Well, I know you'd do the same thing for me if I needed it, wouldn't ya? I would hold white hot steel in my hand to save you. Are you kidding? [Leonard] Cosby's acceptance was immediate and overwhelming, and this encouraged the medium, the television medium, to say, "Hey, look what we discovered. Black people are not only acceptable, but they're good box office. People like to watch 'em." Look, Kelly, you did what you could. - You phoned it into the police. - Yeah. There's nothing else you could do. Nothing. Alexander Scott, from I Spy, and Julia were designed to overcome the received images of Black people from all forms of media, whether it was minstrelsy and vaudeville, or whether it was television's own early history itself. ["Turkey in the Straw" playing] Hey! Whoo! Hey! Stop it! [TV audience laughing] - Who's taking me today, you or Hannah? - Me! [Gates] These were fully assimilable Black people. These were people who could move into your neighborhood and not disturb you at all. [mid-tempo jazz playing] - Thank you, Mrs. Waggedorn. - Sure. [Julia] I'll come back and get Corey... - That's your mother? - Yeah. - You're what? - Black. Your mother's colored. Of course. I'm colored too. You are? - Yeah! - [laughs] Oh, boy! [both giggling] The political climate of the 1960s sort of forbade liberal-thinking producers from putting any other kind of image on television, and part of their mission, if they perceived it as such, to amplify the civil rights movement rested in telling America that Black people were just like white Americans, um, if not better. You should be proud to have an Einstein in the family. I don't need a seven-year-old prodigy. I want a normal child. But if I don't do something fast, Corey's going to wind up either in the institute for advanced study or the funny kindergarten. You almost have to over-endow the character with attributes that comfort white, middle-class sensibilities and strip him or her of anything else, so that the sense of the white Negro becomes what it takes to make them acceptable. [Carroll] In the Black community, it caused a great deal of anger that said, "She's a sellout. She's an Oreo cookie. Why doesn't this show represent the street where I spend my life, I spend my time? I don't wanna have to think about a woman that has pushed herself into the middle class." We're all so proud of you! [narrator] The controversy around Julia was typical of Black shows, not just in the '60s, but before and since. Because prime-time images of us were so rare, each image became precious, involuntarily bore the burden of representing the race. But since such images were typically one-dimensional, like most of television, they often came under attack, despite high ratings, for what they failed to reflect. Anybody who thinks they can intimidate... And so where Amos 'n Andy was faulted for featuring bumbling Black men in a segregated world... Uh, don't get excited, Andy. This is Miss Yarby and Dr. Chegley. ...Julia was rebuked for much the opposite — an integrated world with a successful Black family, minus Black men. The father had been conveniently killed in military duty. A Black family severed from African American culture and society. Tonight, I think all of us have everything we — [newscaster 1] We interrupt this program. [sirens blaring] The worst race riot since Watts erupted today. [newscaster 2]... more than two dozen fires... [newscaster 3] A massive show of force by Miami police forces... [newscaster 4] In Mississippi, two more Black students were shot and killed... - [newscaster 5]... 200 arrested... - [newscaster 6]... shot and killed. [Turner] It's almost as if there were two Black Americas. There was the Black America that you saw on the news, which confronted racial issues head on. [shouts] Can we get a doctor? [Turner] And then there was the Black America that you saw the rest of the evening on prime-time television, where racial hostility was virtually absent, where harmony dictated the neighborhood, where there were no signs of any kinds of struggles with segregation. - [sirens blaring] - [newscaster] Arrests continue... [Turner] So you get on screen this idealized view of how Blacks and whites work together that most people knew were inaccurately depicting the reality. [police radio chatter] What I said at the time was that the audience gets enough of the confrontation and the incendiary actions of people in the ghettos and people in Watts, for instance. Uh, they see enough of that on the news. They read enough of that in the newspaper. When they turn on television to have a half an hour of pleasantry, let's ignore all of that. [TV audience laughing] [Kanter] In those days, our mandate was to amuse an audience, not to excite them, and I stuck to that mandate to try and amuse as many people as I possibly could. The point is that there is this universe of experience that is held up as the norm, and once people enter it, including whites, then everybody has to sort of work hard to participate in that universe. [announcer] America's favorite family, the Nelsons... [Gray] The entertainment function of television is predicated on the assumption that this world is a comforting world that we all aspire to — Black, white, Latino, Chinese, Japanese, it doesn't matter. [all laughing] That's where I think television's ideological function, to use that language, really starts to show up. But it's hidden behind this notion that television is only there to entertain. Well, in its entertainment, what it's doing is reinforcing, legitimating, normalizing that particular universe.

[audience laughs] When I started All in the Family, one of the early accusations was, "What is this guy doing sending messages?" Or, "How dare he talk about these subjects or address these subjects?" Uh, and I remember very early thinking, "My God, they're talking about sending messages." What was the message in all of the television shows, especially the situation comedies of the '60s? The message was louder and clearer than anything I could do. It was, there were no race problems in America. There was no Vietnam. So I thought, "Well, we're not saying that much at all." You're the one that needs an American history lesson. You don't know nothing about Lady Liberty, standing there in the harbor with her torch held high, screaming out to all the nations in the world, "Send me your poor, your deadbeats, your filthy." [audience laughs] And all the nations sent them in here. They'd come swarming in like ants — your Spanish PRs from the Cariboo in there, your Japs, your Chinamen, your Krauts and your Hebes and your English fags! All of 'em come in here and they're all free to live in their own separate sections... [audience laughs] ...where they feel safe. And they'll bust your head if you go in there. That's what makes America great, buddy! I think that Norman Lear's programming represented the first steps towards reality in depicting American households, and I think it's because the public was growing intolerant across the board of these perfect families they were seeing on prime-time television. [narrator] Throughout television's history, the prime-time family had been a sanctuary against social crisis. Lear readjusted this picture. The TV family, as in real life, became a political battleground. [protesters shouting in distance] [newscaster 1] Cincinnati busing leaders were onstage with the governor... [newscaster 2] Bikers across the city are organizing a mass... [newscaster 3] ... 400 extra policemen tomorrow... [newscaster 4] The president says he, too, is opposed to forced busing. ♪ My home sweet home ♪ [Archie] Our world is coming crumbling down. The coons are coming! [crowd clamoring] [Archie] Well, let's see how wonderful it is when the watermelon rinds come flying out the window! [audience laughs] [Lear] My father was as racist as Archie Bunker, in his own way, and I used to fight with him all the time, and I never thought anybody in America would have a problem with the kind of thing they lived with all the time. I think that if God had meant us to be together, he'd have put us together. But look what he done. He put you over in Africa. He put the rest of us in all the white countries. [audience laughing] Well, you must have told him where we were, 'cause somebody came and got us. [audience laughing, applauding] [narrator] Ironically, this show broke one mold while reinforcing another. Though social change and conflict were now shown to affect family life, through it all, family bonds remained intact. With love, flexibility, and not least humor, our troubles could be contained, even resolved, all in the family. ♪ Good Times ♪ ♪ Any time you need a payment ♪ ♪ Good Times ♪ ♪ Any time you need a friend ♪ ♪ Good Times ♪ ♪ Any time you're out from under ♪ [Rolle] When Good Times debuted, I was happy to do it. ♪ Keepin' your head above water ♪ Because I had long wished to redeem the image of the domestic worker. ♪ Good Times ♪ ♪ Scratchin' and survivin' ♪ ♪ Good Times ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ I... looked at the first script. I said, "Where is these children's father? Where's my husband? There is none." "Oh, no, it wasn't written for that. It was written for you and your three children." I said, "Then you find the actress who can do it. I'm sure there are some who can do it. I can't." [Rolle] Because I insisted, I got a husband. James, how long we been married? - Getting on towards 21 years now. - That's right. And we had a lot of arguments in them 21 years, right? Yeah, we're having a pretty good one right now. - [audience laughs] - Yeah. [narrator] Good Times was the first prime-time series to feature a Black family with both mother and father. In contrast to the integrationist shows of the '60s, Good Times was set in the heart of Chicago's Black South Side community. I mean, we are poor. If you was to make a list of all the things that people want to be, "poor" would be right down at the bottom of the list, just above sick and dead! [audience laughing, applauding] I think with Good Times, you get the attempt to basically replicate what you have in All in the Family, but make it more relevant to what was going on in Black communities across the country. ♪ Living just enough ♪ ♪ Just enough ♪ ♪ For the city ♪ [newscaster 1] Unemployment figures were released today. More than seven million Americans remain out of work. [newscaster 2] Blacks and inner-city residents are bearing the brunt... [newscaster 3] The president has vetoed legislation authorizing over $50 million... [newscaster 4] Another steep rise in Black unemployment. Among young Blacks... - How much money we got in that shoe box? - About $32. That's about some $72 short. I got a hundred ways I can get $70. And I got a hundred ways to warm your butt if you do! [audience laughs] I don't want you stealing, James Jr. I wouldn't do that, Mama. I may just find $70. Yeah, but I don't want you finding it before it gets lost. [audience laughs] I hope I'm coming through to you, boy. Mama, "boy" is a white, racist word! Michael, this ain't no time to be Black. [audience laughs] [Michael] Mama... Good Times represented the greatest potential and also, in my opinion, the greatest failure. It had the greatest potential because it was an inner-city family that was nuclear, that was solid. What is it, another eviction notice? Well, it ain't no valentine card. Oh, baby, we got two of those while you was in the hospital. But my friend Monte, who works down at the projects, he said, "Don't worry about it." That's the same Monte that said, "Nixon was gonna be poor folks' best friend." [audience laughs] Oh, James, I'm so sorry. [Gates] They would talk about real-world issues and how an actual Black family deals with those real-world issues of racism and economic discrimination. But what happened? Dynamite! [audience laughs, cheers] [Gates] They elevated J.J.'s role, which had been one of amusing and sometimes sophisticated comedy, to that of a buffoon. [audience laughs] His humor was tied to a long tradition of the kind of minstrel character. [men cackling] [Gray] J.J.'s function in it was essentially to deflate, to let off a lot of the buildup in the particular issues that the show tried to address. I mean, I thought it was a very— in retrospect, particularly, a very clever use of a character to rob the show of the kind of political bite that it might have. - No! Oh-oh-oh! - [audience laughing] [narrator] By the mid '70s, so-called "ghetto sitcoms" populated prime time, eagerly watched by us all. Ticket! How about that lucky number for today? [audience laughs] Ooh-wee! If it was what it was, then it was at the Y! [Gates] On the one hand, many of us applauded these TV programs because at last, the "reality" of the Black experience — that is, inner-city life — was being represented. On the other hand, these programs were problematic because they represented the hellholes of the ghetto as places where human beings could survive. Ha-ha! Dyn-o-mite! Any of the impetus for changing the American society that could have come from showing these real-world situations as abominable and unacceptable and intolerable was completely lost. I wish they were long enough to cover up my eyes so I wouldn't have to look at your ugly face! - [audience laughs] - Why, you old heathen you! Ow! [blowing whistle] I don't think there's any question that white America is uncomfortable with victimization or however you wanna term the Black experience. That which makes you feel guilty, makes you uncomfortable. [narrator] Could prime time break the mold of comedy and still comfort white America? By what formula, what alchemy, could television transform racial oppression and racial guilt into a drama of the American dream? [woman vocalizing] - [monkeys squealing] - [tribal drumbeat] [Wolper] I felt that Roots didn't sound like a good idea with 90% of the country white, 10% of the country Black. I'm gonna do a 12-hour show where the whites are the villains and the Blacks are the heroes. Does not sound like a very good idea when you first say it. But the thing that attracted me was it showed two things. Number one, it showed the power of an underdog overcoming enormous odds to succeed. Number two, it showed the power of family. [crying] I know that whites are going to be very uncomfortable seeing this program. - Look at this baby. - [chattering] I said I'm gonna have to cast my Blacks... actors as comfortable as I can for the audience watching. I did not want to scare away my white audience before they got to see the program. I wanted to get them in to see the show. And if they thought they were gonna see a show where they were going to be, um, overpowered by the actor — you know, overpowering them in some social message — they may not watch the show. Never had so many white viewers watched anything Black in the history of television. That was amazing. Oh, God, no. No, massa. You can't sell Kizzy too! No, massa, not my baby. Not my child! Oh, massa, no! Not my child, not my baby! - Massa. Massa. - Bell. Massa, beat her. Do anything you want to her! Anything, massa. Tear the skin off her worthless hide! She a awful nigger to do such a thing, massa! Please, massa, in the name of Jesus, have mercy! Me and Toby, we give you our lives, massa. Massa — Forty years, massa! Forty years I served you. - Don't that count for something? - Well, you're doing your job. She disobeyed the rules. She has to suffer the consequences. That's all there is to it. Massa, please, please, massa, I beg you! Please don't sell her! Please, massa! She's already been sold. Oh, then, massa, please sell me and Bell with her. But don't split up the family, massa. You ain't never been that kind of man. Please, massa! Mr. Tom Moore owns Kizzy now. Mr. Odell will take her away then. - Massa. - [Kizzy] No, no, I don't wanna go! Oh, God, my baby! [Kizzy sobbing] No, no! Mama! [Bell] Kizzy! Kizzy! - [whip cracks] - [Bell shrieking] [Kizzy] Missy Anne, please, please! - Missy Anne, please! - [Bell] My baby! - My baby! - [Kizzy] Missy Anne, please! Help me! Help me! Mama! Mama! Mama, no! Mama, help me! Missy Anne, please don't! No, no, no... Mama! [Bell sobbing] Oh, Lord, holy — Oh! Lots of people, I think, can tell you about the aftermath of Roots in the workplace or in the school, about going to work or going to school after each night and the episodes, and the kinds of conversations and dialogues that were opening up between Black and white Americans for the first time, in the aftermath of those episodes of the program. It's a very profound experience. There was something that gripped America about this story that Alex Haley wrote about a current Black person tracing his history all the way over into Africa and going there and finding relatives. I think that part of the popularity of Roots was for just that reason — it showed Black people being just like every other American immigrant group for the first time to such a large audience. Roots was a Horatio Alger story, that's correct, about starting up a family here and ending up here. And that's a good story. Positive stories are much more acceptable to audiences than negative stories are. There ain't nothing hard about being happy. Go on then, mule! [both laughing] - Ain't nothing gonna stop us now! - Let's move on! [Gray] Roots was still an assimilation story. The way in which it was made palatable and the way in which it was made a powerful story was to make it a family saga about movement into America. It didn't indict the American society. It was an indictment of bad people. It was an indictment of certain forms of brutality, but in terms of the whole edifice of American political, social, cultural structure, it came away pretty unscathed. [man] We's here! This here our land! [laughs] [narrator] We had finally found a place in mainstream America, less by changing society as by patiently adapting to it. Television's profoundly conservative bias was again underscored. Prime time has selectively reframed American history, transforming a national disgrace into an epic triumph of the family and the American dream. Still, it seemed for many of us that Roots had at last delivered the positive image of Black success we'd long dreamed of. But had we reached the promised land? If you took the argument implicit in Black history about our images to its logical conclusion, the millennium would come when a refined Afro-American doctor... and his wife, who, let's say, hypothetically was a partner in a Wall Street law firm, and who would be obviously comfortable, very elegant, well educated, who would have lovely, perfect children who would, of course, go off to college. If an image such as that could be projected, let's say, into virtually every American home, the argument went, historically, we as a people would be free. [upbeat jazz melody playing] Hey, back from shopping. How was it? Great. We only had one fight. It started the moment we left and it hasn't finished yet. - Now, what happened? - I took him to Bookmans. He told me I couldn't go in. Dad, Bookmans is a menswear store. [clearing throat] Menswear store. No mothers allowed. Before The Cosby Show came on, the American public had been bombarded with negative images of the Black family. When The Cosby Show came on, and I know even in Cosby's thinking, that it was seen that the Huxtables, the family, would be a good opportunity to project new images of Black people in America that ultimately might diminish... um, uh, attitudes of racism rather than to support them. [narrator] From its premiere, The Cosby Show catapulted into America's top ten shows. The triumphant saga of Roots continued in the Huxtables. - Dad! - [audience laughs] No 14-year-old boy should have a $95 shirt unless he is onstage with his four brothers. [audience laughs] [narrator] In part, the show's success was its image of success, an image perfectly attuned to the politics of post-civil rights America. [crowd applauding] [Ronald Reagan] Economic recovery, rededication to values, all show the spirit of renewal gaining the upper hand, and all will improve family life in the '80s. [crowd applauding] We need to replace a welfare system that destroys economic independence in the family with one that creates incentives for recipients to move up and out of dependency. [crowd cheers, applauds] The Reagan ideology was predominantly that if you open up access to corporations to make money, then the opportunity structure opens up. Well, we see that didn't happen. [newscaster 1] There will be record numbers of the homeless this winter... [newscaster 2] Business failures recently hit a 40-year high. [newscaster 3] Among Blacks, the unemployment rate was almost double... [Gray] We've got this incredible polarization of rich and poor, and Black people converged around the poverty end of that. And I think that to have, then, a show that mediates between that polarization, we come away with a sense in which, well, the society's fine. I mean, there's no problem. You just have to work hard, you just have to have the right values, have the right kinds of desires and aspirations, and it'll be all right. None of this would have happened if we weren't so rich. [audience laughs] Let me get something straight. Okay? Your mother and I are rich. - You have nothing. - [audience laughing] Your father and I are not rich. - We're not? - No, honey, we're not rich. Rich is when your money works for you, not when you work for the money, and we work hard for the money. Ah, yes. [narrator] In many ways, the Huxtable household favored prime-time families of old. The TV family was, again, a mythic sanctuary, a shield against social crisis. Within the worsening polarization of 1980s America, this dream of the happy, harmonious, successful Black family held a powerful seduction. Dad, I have to go to school with these girls. Cosby represents everyone's fantasy. Everyone wants to live that way. Uh, did you lose the case, dear? Oh, I wish I had lost it. At least the thing would be over with. [Turner] The most successful shows depicting the African American experience in America are shows like Cosby that reaffirmed the American dream and hard-core middle class values, where you work hard, you are rewarded with good-looking children, good-looking wives, nice cars, nice households. And that image is the one that's perpetuated. Anything that — that digresses from that norm is suspect and will probably not be granted tenure on prime-time television... - ♪ Do you know what it means ♪ - ...as is evidenced by a program like Frank's Place. ♪ To miss New Orleans ♪ ♪ Where mockingbirds used to sing ♪ - [song continues playing] - [Gates] For many people, Frank's Place was the best television program involving Black people that there's ever been. Frank's Place showed a broader range of types than any other Black television program that I can remember, but it was killed by the ratings. ♪ I dream of oleanders in June ♪ [Maxwell Reid] They didn't know how to handle it and they supposedly couldn't schedule it with anything. Whatever they scheduled it with, there was a problem. It didn't relate to anything else they had on the schedule, so they moved it six times. The audience couldn't find the show. My mother couldn't find the show half the time. ♪ And there's something more ♪ ♪ I miss the one I care for ♪ ♪ More than I miss New Orleans ♪ We looked for the unusual whenever we did the show, but we caught constant flak. They didn't want us to do it. They kept wanting us to be funny. Now if we had been funnier, we'd probably still be on the air. They really want you to be colorless. They want you not to bring your race with you. He shouldn't be off gallivanting with a bunch of snobs who are laughing at him behind his back 'cause he's colored. He oughta be just here letting us — I'm colored? What do you mean, I'm colored? I haven't heard that word in 20 years. - It's nothing, Frank. - No, I wanna know. - See this bag? - Yeah. Which is darker, me or the bag? You. - Which is darker, you or the bag? - What are you talking about? The capital "C" club? In the old days, Frank, if you were a light-skinned Black, you were a Creole, and they spell Creole with a capital "C." If you were dark-skinned, it was creole with a little "C," and there was a big difference between the two. Skin color used to be the big separator in New Orleans, Frank. Still is. They just ain't as out in the open about it. Why would Ozell Dryer have me there? So, what was I going to be, the first darkie in the capital "C" club? Oh, man, look, I am sorry. I should have been more up-front with you about this. But there's a group of us in the club that are trying to change things. - And I'm the guinea pig? - Well, sort of. See, you've got all the credentials to put an end to this whole color thing. Ozell, let me cut to the chase here, okay? All my life, I've been "the only Black." I was the only Black in this class. I was the only Black in that organization. I was the only Black on this team. Look, man, I'm not about to become the only Black in a Black club. I think that's going a little too far. Don't you think? Frank's Place was too real for Americans. I mean, it was the closest thing to the reality that I experienced growing up and that I experience now as a person of color in American society that I have encountered on television. And I don't think that, um, the average white American is prepared to encounter the full complexity of that reality. They want to encounter fictions of that reality which are palatable to them. [Reid] They are comfortable with that, with that kind of fantasy. They are very uncomfortable with Frank's Place. And I understand that. And I'm not saying that that's the worst thing in the world. It's just that I'm comfortable with my people. I'm comfortable with my background. I wanna see my story told. [narrator] By the end of the 1980s, television had been in American homes just over 40 years. The status of Black Americans had remarkably improved. You never told us how you feel about Black people. Well, you sure gotta hand it to 'em. I mean, two years ago, they was nothing but servants and janitors. Now they're teachers and doctors and lawyers. They've come a long way on TV. [audience laughs] [narrator] African Americans continued to succeed, in prime time. But what of the historic dream that new positive images would help improve America's race relations? I don't think that you can change 300 years of history, 300 years of the exploitation of Black people by white people in the West, that you can change hundreds of years of the representation of Black people in stereotypical roles just by having a prominent Black man in a situation comedy. It's not gonna work that way. Images are one part of a larger formula of social behavior, and you can't give to them all of this importance, that they will free us if only we can control them. They do not have enough autonomy to liberate us. [audience cheering, laughing] [narrator] Still, if TV alone cannot liberate us, it continues to mold how we are seen and defined. One while, they said we could only sing and dance. Then when we left singing and dancing, we could only be comics. But there is room for the comic. There's room for the dancer. There's room for the singer. There's room for the serious dramatic actor. There is room — What makes you think a whole people... have to be alike? And how dull and uninteresting we would be. What we get is the continuing press towards an imaginary middle. And part of my critique is of that imaginary middle, uh, whether it's a class middle, whether it's a racial norm, um, whether it's some idealized aspiration about what a good life is. I think that what we need are more complicated ways of imagining ourselves in the world that are truer to what people know and what people's imaginations are about, and that those things are inflected by difference, and that what we need to do is begin to illuminate that difference, not so that people are divided and can't have access to each other, but so that we understand the ways in which inequality gets perpetuated and operates. But also so that we learn more about each other and more about ourselves. And I think that television simply hasn't done that. ♪ Such a taste ♪ ♪ That never gets too heavy ♪ ♪ It's gossamer It never holds you down ♪ [narrator] African Americans have claimed a high profile in this commerce of pop culture. But what have we bought and what have we traded? Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for new fictions, just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized fictions of the family and the American dream? And if this is the price of the ticket to acceptance, is it worth paying? Is this dream worth keeping alive?
