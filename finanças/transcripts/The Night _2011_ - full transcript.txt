Did you ever hear the story - about Rodney Costello? - Did you ever hear the story about Rodney... It's a true story. - Costello. - I heard it from a friend - of a friend of mine. - Did you ever story - about Rodney Costello? - Actually happened right here in the city. Time to go home. Kids. Okay, kids time's, time's up. Fun's over. Time to go home. Kids. Do you want me to call your parents? Is that what you want? Everybody okay in there? Goddammit! O'Toole, I got another one. I don't know who it is. Get your ass over here! I don't remember hearing that story about a dark, dark night. No, no, it's a dark, dark house. No, it's a dark, dark woods. I'm done with this. Matt, I told you. Calm down. Okay man, we're done. Settle down. So 11 years really, I don't think I've ever had a relationship last 11 days. Well, it looks like we're past the halfway mark. Way past but I'll stick around until after this weekend at least. I pulled way too many strings to get it off, I'm not about to spend it alone. Like that would ever happen. So all this time and no wedding bells. Well. Well what? Go ahead, tell them. Tomorrow night. We have a reservation, we made them a year ago. Yeah, we have a real reservation at a chapel at the Falls. Wow, the Chapel Falls. Matt, does your dad know? No, only you guys. Seriously. Is that all you have to say? Congratulations. I'm a bit shocked. So how'd you guys meet? We met on internet chat board for girls with sexy scars. He's kidding. It's sexy, come on show them. Ow, that looks like it hurt. You don't wanna know, customer from hell. That's what you get for breaking up a bar fight. Seriously, how'd you guys meet? I was on date and Katie was our bartender. They didn't look like they were having the best time. Was this Heather you were with at the time? No, it was Holly. Did I ever meet her? Yeah, dancer at the Spearmint Rhino. You mean stripper. Is there a difference? Touche. I'm starving. So where's the honeymoon? There's no time. Both of our classes go back on Monday. Can't keep the 10-year-olds waiting. Excuse me I teach sixth grade, they're 12. Oh, my mistake. We're going to Maui on spring break. Oh, can we come? No seriously? So aren't you afraid? Afraid of what? Of never being with another guy. I've never been with another guy. What? Matt was my first, my only. Wait, wait, wait, you mean you don't wanna know what it's like to you know? No, not really. I'm happy. I'm really, really happy. I couldn't imagine being with anyone else. I mean he's everything I could ever want. He's even great with kids. Obviously. Wow, one guy forever. You think I'm crazy, don't you? No, jealous. I wanna feel that way. You will. So who else is coming tomorrow night? No one, just us. We never really wanted a big fancy wedding anyway. What about your parents? Both dead. I'm sorry. So no maid of honor. No. Can I? Since no one else is doing it. I would love that. Cool. All right, let's play some poker. Joker's Wild. No jokers in this deck. All right, place your bets. All right, here comes the flop. Okay. This always happens here I swear it. It's the damn dam. That's why it always pays to have an electrician handy. Got a flashlight? Are you afraid of the dark? Thanks honey. Do you wanna hear a story? In a dark, dark forest there was a dark, dark house and in that dark... Stop it. Dark house there was a dark, dark room. - I said stop it. - Come on man. - Hey, she didn't mean anything. - Shut up. Where are the circuit breakers? They're in the basement. Perfect. Moron. I want another beer. As soon as I can see I'm packing my bag and getting as far away from here as I can. You just freaked him out all right. I told you it's a touchy subject. Why? Rodney Costello. Come on. Rodney was just 10-years-old when he disappeared. Okay guys story time. In dark, dark woods there was a dark, dark house. And in that dark, dark house there was a dark, dark room. And in that dark, dark room there was a dark, dark closet. And in that dark, dark closet there was a dark, dark cupboard. And in that dark, dark cupboard there was a dark, dark box. And in that dark, dark box there was a. Come back! I'm sorry. Come out, come out wherever you are. Come on Rodney, knock it off. Shut up you guys, I hear him. Steve. Did you find it? You don't believe in that do you, a real urban legend? I was really little when it happened. Yeah, no kids went anywhere that summer. Steve, are you sleeping down there or what? He might as well. Steve. Oh my God, Steve. He was my best friend. So you said. Well we'll get it all straightened out. This is ridiculous. Can't your father do something? I guess you should have called him instead of 911. There was something down there. The basement is sealed up like a bank vault. There's nothing there. There's no windows, no doors. Oh, except the one that your boyfriend came walking back out of covered in the victim's blood. We've turned it upside down there is nothing else. So you're trying to tell me that he ripped his own throat out. That's what you're trying to tell me. No. What I'm telling you is that it wasn't Matt okay. We were all sitting, waiting for Steve to get the lights back on. That your story too? 83720584. Okay. Finally. Let's go, Matt. Let's go girls, inside. Why? - What are you doing? - Inside. What are you doing? Why? It's for your own protection. All right, you wanna tell me what really happened? I told you what happened. I'll ask you again. Why are you wasting your time with me? Because I don't believe you. I'd never believe you. All right, tell me about this fight that Steve had with his girlfriend. He freaked out a little. When the lights went out she, in a dark, dark woods, there was a dark, dark house. I think you know the rest. When you're gonna be straight with me we'll talk. Come on, you saw his body, how can you even think? I mean maybe something escaped the zoo. The only problem with that theory is there's no claw mark, no teeth marks, so no wild animals. Got another murder, we gotta roll. What? Where? Lakeside Resort. Who? Does the victim have a name? It's Tom Petrocelli. Call in the chief. What do you want me to tell him? That it's happening again. You mean... Just call him. What the hell was that about? Rodney! This is breaking news. Mysterious death of Rodney Costello has been under investigation for years. Call the search off. Investigators now believe there may be foul play. I'm sorry Lori, it's been three days. The dam has to be turned back... Psychiatrist Maxwell Crown states, "Rodney's peers used a bullying technique "known as prejudicial bullying," "which causes severe hatred and revenge on the victim." He states, "If Rodney survived his death" "he may be retaliating because something" "was taken from him." You'll be sorry! They'll all be sorry! Tourists watched on in horror at Niagara Falls as a woman police identified as Lori Ann Costello went over the edge in a bid to harm herself. I'll be okay, Mom. I have that lucky Indian doll Katie gave me for Christmas. Rescuers who scrambled to the scene after she was seen by onlookers intentionally entering the water and dragged over the edge by the currents. Williams. - Chief. - I'm running over there now. Yeah, O'Toole told me to call you. It's been a crazy night. I'm on my way. Okay. See what the problem is. Just try to relax. Did you find it? Keep it down in there! 10 seven investigation. Central three 1,000. Hamrick, get in here and drain this thing. Yes, Chief. Talk to me O'Toole. Yeah, talked to his mom, she hadn't heard from him in a few days so. Jesus, bodies are piling up. Anyway cross him off the list. And you're sure it's Tom Petrocelli. Yep, definitely Tom Petrocelli. Okay, meet me at the station. Yes, sir. See what the problem is. 39 Clarence Avenue. Matt. Dad. Get you out of here. Chief Williams. The police chief is your father. Dad, this is Katie. I don't understand then why are we locked up? O'Toole probably thought you were safer in here. He certainly wasn't talking like that. Are you okay? We're better than Steve. Steve Hendrickson. I told you guys not to come back here. Oh my God. Mark. O'Toole just found Petrocelli. And there's reports of bodies coming in from all over town. 837820584. This can't be happening. You've got to warn the others. What do you want me to do, call them up in the middle of the night and tell them to keep the lights on? What would you say? Tell you to sleep it off and then I'd hang up. Exactly. That's why you've gotta go to them. You gotta find them face-to-face, tell them. I've been keeping track of their names and addresses over the years. Dad, I haven't seen these guys in like... Yeah, I think they're gonna remember you. Look, I need you guys to go to the corner store, get flashlights, batteries, whatever you can get your hands on, okay. This is a joke, right? You think I'd be joking about anything right now? Listen to me, stay out of the dark! We don't know what's happening. O'Toole's finding bodies all over town. And I want you to stay in touch with me. I know, I know, we will. I didn't want this. What's going on? I thought this was over. Listen, you heard my father, okay. You heard what he said. We have to stay out of the dark. Why Matt? Why do we have to stay out of the dark? I always like the dark. I've always have a lot of fun in the dark. Some of my best times ever. So tell me why the hell should I be so frightened now? You're just gonna let her go? She'll be fine. Where are you going? Don't worry about me I'll be fine. Penelope. Wait! How many are left on this list? The list Dad gave me has eight people on it. Not including myself. What are you gonna do Matt? We're gonna stay out of the dark. The one in the black shirt he's name is Ralph... Bellwood. And this one's Gary White. You know 'em. Went to school with my kid. I can't imagine anything other than a bear causing this kind of damage. Get them over to ME's office, bag that candle. Matt, you wanna tell us what's going on? I don't know. I know when men are lying to me. You do it all the time. What? She deserves to know. Whatever. Yeah, whatever. Now this is frightening. Yeah. Maybe we should just spend the night here. In here? There's plenty of light. You gotta try that on. No. Come on. It'll take our mind off. Only if you try these on. Are you kidding? I'm gonna try them all on. What do you got? Does the name Carl Tobin ring any bells? That was Carl Tobin. You can get everything here. Katie! Katie! Matt, where are you? Matt! Attention shoppers it appears we have suffered a brief power interruption. There's no need to panic. Where are you? Come on. Where are you, Matt? Rodney, come on! Shh, quiet, quiet. Attention shoppers. Let's pay for this crap and get out of here. Our maintenance supervisor assures me everything is back to normal. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Well, care to tell us where we're going. Vegas. Really? Good. It's never dark in Vegas unless you want it to be. What's in Vegas? Future. Investigators are stumped by the disappearance of Rodney Costello. Interviews with his peers only disclosed a secret cult Between all of them. Each speak of a doll know as the Ghost Witch that Rodney was given by sister Katie. The doll was never found. Rodney's body was never found. Is there a connection? The intra-abdominal exam reveals a liver that has been punctured with something. I'm not sure what. Whatever it is it's quite blunt. The kidney is not in its proper place. Seems to be okay on one side but there are three puncture like wounds in it. I have not seen anything like this before. There almost like small fingers or something, almost child size. That one measure one centimeter in length, .2 millimeters wide. Here's the other kidney. It's completely crushed almost like a fist came and just scrunched it. Very unusual. I've never seen anything like this. The bowels are all cut up. Squished up. This was a very violent death for this man. I thought you said we were going to Vegas. Yeah. This isn't the exit. I just need to make a stop first. Why? To warn somebody. What Matt, to keep the lights on? A lot of good that's been doing. Do you think it can help? I don't know. I don't know if anything can. I won't be long. Todd. Matt. Matt Williams. It's 4:00 a.m. I know it's. Come on in, I'll put on some coffee. That is a good idea. This is breaking news. Folklore states the Ghost Witch was one of the scariest figures in mythology. Said to be born from the dead body of shaman who practiced black magic. The demonic entity then emerges each night with murder on its mind. Killing by fire. Still wanna get married? Have a boat load of kids. They're all dead. Except us. Steve, the others too. All dead. It's been all over the news. Where have you been? Afghanistan. I just got back last month from a two year tour. My brother was taking care of the place but he didn't say anything. Probably figured you had your own set of problems. Have you spoken to him lately? No, he's up at the cabin, I think. Any suspects? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. Rodney Costello. Rodney's dead. How do you know that? They never found his body. You were taking too long. This is my fiance Penelope, Katie. This is Todd Schaeffer. We've met actually. His first night back in town, came into my bar I was feeling patriotic. Did you lose my number? Sorry. I had to get settled in. Whatever. Met someone better the next night anyway. Figured you would. You know you still haven't answered the question. I assumed he was dead. You think he's running around killing people. Are you done here? Just give me a minute. I'll meet you outside. Fine. So why are you really here, Matt? To warn you and your brother. Don't worry, I can handle myself so can he. Look I've seen what this thing can do. It's not human. You mean he, come on. You're really scared aren't ya? It pretty much ripped Steve's head right off. There are bodies all over town. Look I'm sorry. Tell the girls I'm sorry too and thanks for the warning. I'll keep my eyes open. What did you do Matt? What did you do? Nothing. What did you guys do with Rodney in the woods? Nothing, we did. I don't believe you. That was our crime we did nothing. We just stood there. Rodney! Try and get me something to help him, don't just stand there! Rodney! Oh my God! Rodney! You just left him there. I was eight-years-old I didn't know any better. And what's been your excuse not telling anyone since then, Matt? It wouldn't bring Rodney back. Is that why you became a teacher, guilt? Answer me! Listen all right, okay, okay, okay. I thought maybe if I helped some kids it would make some sort of difference, I don't know. I don't believe it, I don't believe any of it. What? Are you okay to drive? I haven't slept a single night since. I'm awake. I'll be all right. That kid was so afraid of the dark. It was like a sickness that we all caught. Rodney was really, really afraid of the dark. It's a true story. - And one night. - Really afraid of the dark, and one night on a camping trip he got so scared of a scary story being told that he ran off into the woods. And nobody knows what happened to him. - They never... - And nobody knows... - Found his body. - What happened to him. They never found his body. They never found his body. Take this. You're not bringing that in the hotel right now. Take these. No, I'm not bringing that in. Come on. All right. Get some food. Maybe I should just go home. Alone after what's happened. I'll be okay. I want you here, please. Please stay. Come on stay, please. So what are we gonna do now? We should get some rest. You wanna sleep now. Well, it's daylight. He doesn't seem to attack during the day. You speak of him like it's Rodney. Like he's running around. Listen, let's just get a couple hours of sleep then we'll go find Danny Sullivan, all right. I'm gonna go wash my hands. How would you feel if that happened to one of your students? I would never forgive myself. Me either. I let him go. What? Why? You can't run and hide in a jail cell. Is that what you think they been doing all these years. All these bodies keep popping up and then it's quiet for awhile and now suddenly it's all happening again. And somehow you think it's my son. Look Steve went into the same house as your boy, why is only one of them in the morgue? You got something to say, spit it out. I just think these boys have been hiding something all these years and frankly it's payback time. Hiding what David? You think these kids conspired to kill Rodney Costello? That they all banded together to cover up for Danny Sullivan and all these later not one of them has spilled the beans. Or confessed, which makes them all guilty. So who would want them all dead? I think it's time we pay Eddie another visit. All right, let's get some sleep. I'll set the alarm. I love you. I love you too. Did you know him, Rodney? Not really, he was a little older than me. A lot of the kids used to pick on him because he was so small for his age but. Did you? No. Did you laugh when the others did? Are you gonna pee in your pants like the last time? No. Yeah, you big baby. That's sad. Do you think we're gonna be okay, Matt? Matt. This dam was built in 1902 kids and it provides water for the entire area. But before that a long time ago there was Indian princess and she was capture by an enemy tribe. And they put her in their canoes and they started going down the river. Now as they were going down they could hear a rumbling and a crashing sound and they asked her, "What that noise was?" She told them, "It was just some small rapids." And she was so calm when she said it that they believed her. Now what do you guys think was over there. It was the falls. And they went over the falls and they all died. Now some people say that the spirit of the Indian princess is still down there today and I think I see her right now! Okay, that's good kids. Hey guys, let's line up. We got to go. Everybody over here. Let's head to the vans. Everybody out single file. Come on guys. Pick it up. Let's go, let's go. No running! Okay. Hey Rodney, I know where the Indian princess lives. Wanna go check it out tonight after everybody's sleeping? Yeah man, let's do it. Okay. Goodnight. Katie. Katie, find him. Eddie, I just really don't think he's ready for an overnight field trip. Nonsense honey, he'll be fine. Honey, take your hat off at the table. Okay. I'll be okay, Mom. Besides I have that lucky Indian doll Katie gave me for Christmas. Right, Dad? Absolutely son. Besides I know Danny Sullivan, he's a good guy. He'll take care of him. And in that dark, dark box there was a. Rumors has it that maybe he - just ran away forever. - Rumors has it that. Maybe he died. - Rumors has that... - Maybe he was killed. Maybe he just ran away forever. - And no one really knows. - Maybe he was killed. Maybe he died. - And no one really knows. - Maybe he was killed. And no one really knows. This is Eddie's apartment. That's his place right up there. What do you think we're gonna find in there? Closure would be nice. Not always what it's cracked up to be. Eddie, Eddie, it's Jake Williams. Eddie! Eddie. It's Jake, Eddie. We just wanna talk to ya. Eddie. Clear. I said I'm sorry! - I'm sorry! - Sick son of a bitch. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Mr. Costello, Mr. Costello, go home to your family. I don't have a family anymore. I trusted you with my boy! You were supposed to be looking after him! Instead he! He what? Tell me. If you have any information that Danny Sullivan knows something about Rodney Costello I wanna know 'cause I'll go over there and finish the job myself. My boy's out there too. Your boy's still alive! Katie. How could we've not know she's been here all along. Went to school with my kid. And in that dark, dark box there was cute, cute boy. How could we have known? We had her in custody. You locked her up. I'm the one who let her go. Mr. Carl Tobin. You look uncomfortable. Nervous. What if your wife finds out? That will never happen. Can you shut the lights off? Come on baby, it's just you and me. I wanna see everything you've got. Please. Come on baby. Just this one time, I promise. You won't believe what you're feeling. I like the sounds of that. Now lie down on the bed. You ready? I've been waiting my whole life for this. Sure you have. Did you find it? What the hell is that? You think it's been the two of them the whole time? Both of them this whole time. Matt, Matt, wake up! Matt! Wake up! Turn on the light! Turn the light on! Oh no! - Katie. - We gotta get to Danny right now. Katie, come on, we gotta go! Katie! Katie! The keys are gone. Katie, where are you? Come on we gotta go. The keys are gone. She's not here. Could she of taken the car? So what are we gonna do? Okay listen, we don't need the car. We gotta get to Danny right now. Let's go! She's got a lot of doctors bills. For what? Doesn't say exactly. I can't believe we haven't seen her here before now. She's been coming here quite a lot. Pays cash for everything, smart. Looks like the earliest bill is August 27, no August 18th. Harold Schaeffer. Todd's twin brother. He's up at the cabin, I think. Jesus, Fort Knox. Jerk. Not again. Come out, come out wherever you are. Come out right now or you're dead! What are you doing here? God, I'm sorry. Let me see. Now we know a bullet was discharged from his weapon at some point during the struggle. And that bullet was never found until now. I'm sorry. Did you find it? Rodney, I'm sorry. I can't move. Gonna pee in your pants like last time big baby. I'm sorry. Don't worry we won't tell. Rodney, don't do it. Don't do it. Please, please, Rodney, please. Please. Matt, are you sure this is the right place? This is what Dad said. Come on. Matt. Danny. I'd never thought I'd see you guys again. How long have you worked here? I own the place. It's home. What is this place? You're afraid of the dark, aren't you? Yes. So what happens if there's a blackout? I've got generators and I've generators to back up the generators. Soon as the lights go out in a hundredth of second everything kicks in, I'm ready. All planned out. This is Katie. Nice to meet you. Where were you? I was on my way home, I had had enough but then I couldn't let you guys face this alone. Why didn't you help him? What are you talking about? Rodney. What he tell you? I told the everything. It was your job to protect us that night. Get the hell out of here. We came here to help you. Help me? Yeah. You came here to accuse me. What is this? This was Rodney's, why do you have this? You never called the police that night did you? They say though if you tell the story that scared him away on a dark, dark night that Rodney Costello will come back from the grave and haunt you and kill you for revenge. For all the people who are scared... - For all the people... - Of the dark. - Who are scared of the dark. - This is how the story goes. This is how the story goes. In a dark, dark... There was a dark, dark house. There was a dark, dark house. - And in that dark, dark... - And in that dark, dark... - And in that dark, dark... - There was a dark, dark room. There was a dark, dark room. Screw you, I did everything that I could! Everybody did! Now get out! All of you! Out, get out! - Get out! - Matt! - Get out! - Come on. You too, out! And I don't ever wanna see any of you again! I just don't get it, why does he have this and why is he still alive? Maybe Rodney was just trying to find him. And we led him right here. Matt, I don't care. We gotta go, we gotta go right now. Come on, come on! Eddie, take it easy. I told you you'd be sorry. We just wanna talk Eddie. Guess you've met his sister. Her mother took here away from me right after Rodney disappeared. I wasn't even allowed visitation rights. You both testified against me at the hearing, said, "I was having problems controlling my anger", "I was drinking too much." You were. Yeah, I guess. Probably better for me anyway. Better for her. You should of found him when you had the chance. He was lying there for hours and hours. Dad. Calling me. Come on Eddie, you can't know that. I know. He told me. We were just feet away. Did you find it? We were all right there. Eddie! Follow him, follow him! Come on Eddie, we can talk about this. Eddie. Oh God! I'm sorry. Did you find it? All right, come on out! Did you find it? I told you guys not to come back here! This way. Oh my God! This way. Come on. No, you can't leave him there, Matt. We gotta get out of here right now. You can't just leave him hanging there. Listen, we have to get out of here right now. We're okay, we're okay, we're okay. You're gonna be all right. We're gonna be okay. Don't you get it Matt, you're the only one left. You're next. Listen, what times our appointment? What times our appointment at the chapel? Eight o'clock. Okay, we're gonna get married tonight, all right. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you no matter how long that may be, okay. All right, we're gonna be find. Come and get me! Come on! I don't care. I'm marrying this girl! I wanna spend the rest of my life with her. Come on and get me. Sure you wanna do this? We'd like to get married. Oh yes, sign right here. And you are? Maid of honor. Excellent. Something special for you. Are you all signed in? - Yes. - Good. Follow me. Let's do it. By the power vested in me I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - I love you. - I love you too. It's Dad. Dad, you're never gonna guess what I just did. - Did you find it? - I can barely hear you. Did you find it? What? - Did you find it? - I can't hear you. Oh my God, oh my God, Matt, get my gun, get my gun and my flashlight. He doesn't wanna hurt you. What are you talking about? You've been in on this the whole time. What are you doing? Did you find it? He's my brother, I've only been trying to help him. It's okay, it's over. Stop, please! Stop! Did you find it? This is breaking news. After an extensive search of a gruesome murder scene of what appears to have been a wedding the bodies of Rodney Costello and Penelope Gray were never found. This following weeks of multiple murders of equal veracity. Could it be the Ghost Witch does exist.
