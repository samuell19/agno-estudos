Kyle! Kyle McCormick! What are you doing here? I was... Can you put that flashlight down, please? Thank you. You know, this is private property. I'm looking for my son, Kyle. He came here with you? No. - Boys from school-- - They dared him. Lady, you would not believe how many kids I've had to run off ever since America's Most Haunted was here. But we've collected nearly $200,000 in trespassing fines just from the last year. - My son is not a trespasser. - Mm-hmm. -How old is he? -Fifteen. Uh, he's probably out just joyriding with his friends. They're probably mooning some takeout window at the local burger joint by now. Why don't you go home? He'll turn up. They don't always, do they? - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Kids, teenagers, they run away from home. Boys, especially. Heck, they were doing that ever since I was in high school. But more of them disappear after coming here, don't they? Well, we don't keep records on that sort of thing. Sheriff, please. Look around. I don't have to see it on TV to know... there's something wrong about this place. That place? People got hurt here, people died here. You don't believe what people say about... the ghosts of the dead. I don't believe in ghosts, I don't believe in poltergeists, I don't believe in shadow people. What do you believe in? I believe in evil. And Pennhurst is evil. All right. Look. I'll look for him. What's he wearing? His red letterman's jacket. He was so proud to get his letter in JV track. - Red letterman jacket? - With white sleeves. Okay. Got it. With white sleeves. Why don't you go on home? I'll look for him. All right. Thank you. Son of a bitch. Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Let's go, son. Kyle, your mom's worried about you. She wants you to come home. All right, son, you're trespassing. I hear you, son. Kyle. All right. Stop crying, son. I'm not gonna do it. No! Guys, it's not much further. You said it was, like, two minutes. We walk this fucking many steps every day at school. All right, guys, we're almost there. - Are you taking us-- - Oh, yeah, really? You're alive, guys! Wouldn't offer you up for sacrifice if you were dead, so I'm gonna make sure you get there alive. Fucking kill you if we don't make it, dude. Really, save us. I don't trust you to protect me. Yeah, really? Tour guide, Vincent, thank you. Will you wait up? What's the fucking rush? Wouldn't wanna miss the haunted insane alyssum. You don't believe me? This shit's the real deal, they're filming, uh, some TV show here. Haunted America? Ghost Finders, the one on the Syfy Channel. And that's cool because... That's not the point, Jen. The point is, this is Pennhurst. Eighty acres of... fucked-up haunted mental institution. Sorry, Dad, but... Chris, they'll take you. Don't let them take me, Dad. I'm sorry. It's time, Chris. Don't let them take me. Don't let them take me. Dad! Dad! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Dad! Dad! Dad! Looks like a tough one. Give him a sedative. Don't worry, we'll break him. Seriously? Why the hell are we here? They're turning this place into a theme park or something. -Haunted theme park? -Yeah, whatever. Look, the point is, that after this, it's gonna be impossible for us to sneak in here. -So let's go? -Let's do it. -Let's go? -Let's go. - Haunted theme park. - Ooh. This guy is busy at work, right here. I don't know what the hell he's doing. Working himself to the bone. Ooh, Jake! - Oh, showers. - Showers, there you go. Haunted day spa. - There you go, Jasmine. - Shut up. And, of course, the food court. Oh, there we go. If you care for some late refreshments. Fine dining up in here. Your choice of white food, grey food, or orange food. Hi, Grandpa, how are you doing? Yes, so this is my grandpa. That's great, they're scared. -Seriously? -That's not funny. Fuck you, Jake! Ooh! - Why did you that? - Stop it. Good shit, man. - Awesome. So good. - Stop. - That's really not funny. - Ow! Look at this stuff. Harrowing conditions. I can't understand why they needed hospitals like this. People didn't understand mental illness back then, just because they thought it was all about Satan and demonic possession and shit like that. So, they were gonna torture them straight? - Whoa! - What is it? Now, 1683 they were still... Bullshit! I mean, the state kinda wanted to be exclusive on freaky puritan behavior. The governor, William Penn, actually sat on a trial as one of the judges. Now, these two Swedish immigrant women were-- That's ancient history, why do you even wanna know shit like that? Vincent's going to college. Not community college, but real-life four-year college. I'm impressed. -Really? -No. College is a waste of money. Vincent, you spelled "fuck" wrong. I meant to do that. Does this get any better? Yeah, when the ghosts come out. This is lame, it's just an empty building. No way. You don't know what happened here? What? A whole TV show film crew disappeared here last year. I never heard that. Well, no one did, but it's true. My dad has a friend in the police force. Who were they? They were from that show with the psychic chick, - the one on channel nine. - I love that channel. Um, they have that show with the guy who eats bugs in foreign countries, but I never understood why they had ghost shows on there. Yeah. That's not the point. The point is they came here to shoot a segment... and they were never heard from again. Hey, listen, if we don't get these shots and nail this, somebody's gonna have my balls, okay? I'm not going down alone, I'll tell you that. Oh, man, this is real Deliverance territory, right here. Oh, good, you'll fit right in, then. Any chance Matilda loves us enough to spring - for a decent meal for a change? - Ya got a pretty mouth. Yeah, right. She wants you hungry. Makes you work harder. Uh-huh. Making you hungry makes you faint. Yeah, that's such crap. But how could Bruce Willis not have known he was a ghost? -I mean... -He was dead. You're not thinking straight when you're dead. And didn't he think it was weird that he didn't have to pee? Well, he didn't drink anything after his death, so maybe he figured out that was why. What about sleeping? Didn't he notice he never got tired? - Oh, yeah, good point. - Yeah. -What was that? -What happened? Holy shit, did I just hit something? No, you didn't. -The fuck was that? -Did not sound good. You want me to throw it in the back? - How are you? - Hello? I'm standing in front of the abandoned state mental hospital known as Pennhurst. - And let me tell you... - I can't hear you. ...as you can see, it is eerie. I know. I know. I know. Pennhurst served as the clearing house of the mentally ill and unfortunately the hunting grounds of the abusive attendants. And now, according to local legend, these grounds are riddled with the ghosts of the violent past. - Damn! I'm good. All right. - Yeah. It was good. All right, three... Donuts? Bags? Anyone? The ghosts have a truly violent past. Motherfucker! - Wow, yeah. - Okay. Just keep it going. Do you think you nailed that? - Shh. In three, two, one. - Yup. So, I'm gonna try to get a reading now - and see if I can feel anything. - Oh, my God. - Nothing. - Really? I'm not picking up any... Badger, please don't talk. Damn it, man. Come on! That was-- You're blowing take after take and I did the trance and everything. Scott! You think you did the trance? Shut up! Scott, can I talk to you? - Donuts? - Do you need help? Oh! You're the caretaker? I'm Willard. We're supposed to check in with you when we got here. -We're here. -Okay. You live around here? I used to. Uh, do you-- Do you know Pennhurst pretty well? Yes. You think you could show us around? It would be better if you left. Scott, I thought this was all arranged, this was all cleared. What's going on, who's this? It would be better if you left. Are you saying we have to leave? It's up to you. All right. Let's do a walkthrough, guys. When I'm talking, don't talk. - Guys, come on! - Huh? - Let's do a walkthrough. - Oh, okay. Scott, I wish you would not tell him. -I wish you would not tell him. -Cameras, enough. Then Matilda's considering letting do stuff-- Yeah. Just no. -Because all he does is... -You are doing great. -You are doing great. -I know I'm doing great. Where the hell is Elden? He thinks the bathroom still works, I don't know. Pennhurst State School and Hospital sits on 115 acres of land. It's composed of 17 different buildings, all of which are connected through a series of underground tunnels. Oh, awesome. Where are those? I'm not sure. The building we're in now was referred to as Building A. This must've been the day room. We're in what was known as Q1, back when it was in use. Marginally retarded low-maintenance patients spent their days in here. Ah. You must feel right at home there, Badger. No, she said Q1 was for marginally retarded. I don't think Badger would've made the cut. Okay, next. You guys are hilarious, you know. Pennhurst had a staff of doctors including surgeons and dentists. Watch your step. So this is maybe some sort of operating room or-- They were at the forefront of cutting-edge medical treatments like sterilization or... pulling the teeth of patients who might bite. - Ooh. - That's nasty. I think one of you girls should show your boobs, maybe we'll see some ghosts down here. - You know what-- - All right! - Moving along. - Disgusting! - What did I miss? - Nothing, at all. Okay. Where's Megan? Megan! Coming. What is this? It's popular with the rats. Oh, look at this. - It this remodeled? - This is the cafeteria. Okay. Yum. Everyone ate as a group, patients, attendants, doctors. Doesn't look so bad. I mean, lots of room, plenty of light. Just wait. Okay. Let's get out of here. Wait, let's see what's on the menu. Yeah, if they're serving chili, -I'll definitely stay. -Follow me, watch your steps. I had a house on the Jersey Shore like this. Any guesses on what this is? Oh, the attitude readjustment room? Sort of. It's actually the electroshock therapy room. Ooh, kinky. At the time they started using it, it was considered cutting edge therapy. Look at this. I got to get me one of these. It's beautiful, yeah. Huh? - Whoa! - Dude, dude! - Whoa! - Okay! Really? - Sorry, I had to. - Oh, I like that. Nice try. -I tried. -All right. Okay. Next room. Watch your football game in here, you don't have to move. This is one of the dorms. So they kept them all in the same rooms? Not everyone, but some. They had to. The facility was designed to accommodate 800 patients. At its peak, it held 2,500 and they never had enough staff. So, they grouped a lot of them together. What is that? That must be the crib. I saw it on a documentary. Some of the patients were essentially babies in adult bodies, so they put them in a giant crib. Oh, man, it looks like they kept them there. Many patients spent their entire lives at Pennhurst. From childhood until they died of old age. That's a lot of Depend. Right. Thanks a lot. I think they should be called Definitely. Oh, yeah! Definitely, that's good. -Yeah. -And why do you have a coupon? If you're shitting yourself, who cares about the $3? You got to pay $1,100 apiece if you have to. Pay close attention to this one, Elden. Because this is where they would end up. - Picking anything up? - Not a thing! Nothing, man? -I'm shocked. Yeah. -The morgue! Yup! I believe they also did autopsies in here, too. - Oh, yeah. - Look at this. Oh, this is great. -Don't touch that! -I'm just getting a reading. Take a peek in here. Yeah. We can get a camera in there, right? Yeah, sure. Nice, though. One-stop retard shopping. Oh, Badger, you might not wanna let them hear you say that, because you could end up in here at some point. Whoa! Shit! Sorry. Come on, guys! Next room. What the hell's the matter with you? -Crazy. -Right? This is Building B, where the more severely handicapped were kept. What's more severely handicapped? - Vegetables! - Essentially. Invalids. People who just couldn't function on the most basic level in society. So, they just warehouse them in here. Yup. I mean, what are you gonna do? -You have to live somewhere. -You left out some parts. Jesus, Willard! Shit! Shit! Pennhurst started out as a good idea, yet quickly spiraled downward into a nightmare of... Of intimidation. There's beatings, rapes, and castrations... and experimental psychotropics, and medicinal and psychological abuse. And if you weren't useful to them as-- As slave labor to help make the clothes they sold at a profit to the local businessmen, well, then there was always medical experimentation... and lobotomies. Hey! Who the hell are you, anyway? He's the caretaker. Willard, thank you for the history lesson here, but we're trying to work. Do you need something specific or are you just gonna keep freaking us out? Whoa! Whoa! Holy shit! Look at this, guys! -Yes! I got something! -What you got over there? Hold on a sec, let me see if I can get a reading. No, nada. Yeah. You must've damaged the equipment, Badger. - No, no, no. - There's nothing here. I'm serious. You must've dropped it or something. -We're wasting our time. -Wait. Shh, you guys. What? Did you hear that? What the fuck was that? Anybody got a video camera? Guys! Guys, get over here, you got to see this! Look at this. Right behind that wall. There's a shape. You see that? That was amazing! Oh, my goodness! - Really? Okay. So, do we always find ghosts that fast? - Never. Never during the day. - No. Okay. Jesse and I are gonna take building B. Sarah, Badger, Elden, you guys are Building A. - All right. What's our coverage? - Full. Wireless cams, EVPs, thermals, EMFs, motion-activated still cams. I really want this place covered. Everything will feed back into the production van, and Scott will be on the monitors and acting as quarterback on this one. I think we really have a shot here, guys. -Don't fuck this up. -Oh, thanks for the confidence. I'm serious, Badger. I think this is the real deal, which means real ghosts. So, you know the drill. Don't challenge them, don't aggravate them, show them respect. We're here as researchers. Actually we're here as researchers with shitty ratings. So, let's stir up the pot a little bit? Did you not see what I saw in there? I don't think we have to stir this pot at all. It's not too late to leave. Willard, if you're gonna call the cops, do it. If not, please get out of our way. I'm trying to help. Are we ready? Charged up, extra batteries? - Ready. - Charged. - Let's go. - Okay. Elden, come on! - Over there? - Yes. Wait, so you're saying that they went hunting for ghosts during the day? What a rip! Well, I mean, it's not like the paranormal really has, like, a biological clock. They're up 24/7. What's that for? Oh, that's to bring the ghosts out. Why did they have flashlights during the daytime? What are you asking me for? I didn't make this shit up. Like, this shit happened. Wait. So, when do the ghosts come out? I mean, this isn't gonna be like your last story, I don't think I can handle five more minutes of them walking around with nothing happening. -I mean, does-- -You want some scary shit? How about this? -Hey! -What the fuck was that for? You were trying to grab my boob! -I was just joking, bitch. -Perv. - Cockblock! - Guys! Just chill out, please. All right, this is supposed to be scary. It's haunted. Now, can I finish the F-ing story? All right. So they were... Girls were running out in terror from the haunted house, right? Well, I mean, they went to go get their equipment. Wait, so they're professional ghost hunters who leave their shit in the van instead of bringing them to the haunted house. Look, Cody, I don't need this shit from you right now. Like, if you're not interested in the story, we could call your mom and she could come pick you up. No. That's when shit started to get freaky with a capital freak. Whoa! Yeah. You know what, if you guys don't need me for anything-- Um, actually, you could hang a camera, too. Yeah. You know what, I think I'm gonna try to get some readings in other rooms of this building, you know. - Mm-hmm. - Play to my strengths. Yeah. He has strengths? I heard that, cheeky monkey! - No. No, he doesn't. - Okay. Okay. So, uh, what I'm thinking here is that we get some wider lenses to cover the whole area and then we can, uh... get some softer lenses to cover the doors. Um, you know, because, I mean, it would be really cool if we can, uh, get those, uh, rooms-- The doors closing. Um, yeah, I think if we get the doors closing again, -it's gonna be really cool. -Okay. -And what about the hallways? -What about them? Well, I was just thinking we should put a camera in the hallways, right? That's where the ghost came from in Q1. Just to make sure we cover all our bases. Yeah. You're cute. Okay. So, look, newbie, um, trust me on this. And once you've had a few years in the business like I have, you'll learn a few things. Yeah, um, we gotta cover this room. So, why don't we just do it my way? Hey, Badger. I don't need a few years to know that you're full of shit. So, um, why don't you just cover this room any way you want? All right. Yeah, great. Sounds good. Then I'll just find another room to cover. Oh, um, well, hang on, wait. I mean, I thought-- I thought we could work together, though. You know, I mean, you're new and all. I mean, I could teach you a few things of the experience. Not a fucking chance. Okay. All right. I'll see you. What an asshole! Nice work, Sarah. It was great. Hmm. That went well. All right, check it. I set up my device to monitor EMF readings. Cross-reference them with EVP and thermal data in real time to eliminate false positives. I figure if we can triangulate even the lowest level readings with corroborative data then we can detect more in our data set. Can you speak English, please? This thing F-ing rocks. - That works. - Yes. Okay. Let's set up IRs in here and the hallways. -Yeah, that makes sense. -Let me just go... Did you hear that? Yup. Oh! That's coming from the east hall. Let's go. Help me! I'm not getting anything. Let's go. Hello! We mean you no harm! Troubled souls? Is anyone listening? No? Good. Because you are so... boring. Well, I'm definitely feeling something now. What now? Through that door. Oh, my God. What? Are you seeing this? It's amazing. Holy shit! What was that? Sometimes ghosts just wanna be acknowledged. Willard, have you ever seen anything like this? Yes. So, tell me this, if you were a ghost, where would you be? I'll show you. Oh, fuck! Oh, man, I didn't even hear this thing ring! Oh, man. Oh, shit! Oh, man, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to clear my head before we tape my segment, okay? Sorry if, you know, I-- I just scared you. Okay, dude. Let me get out of your way. Is this your room or something? Do you mind? Hey, man! Hey, let's not fuck round, all right? Megan! Hey! Hey, what the-- Hey! Don't fuck with me! Fuck! Wow. What's this? This is Q2. This is where you were sent for punishment. Most of the patients in this ward had a very low IQ. But if you had normal IQ and you were sent here, it's because you were considered difficult. Being sent to Q2 is far worse than being sent to solitary confinement. You're immersed in a sea of people you couldn't communicate with. That sounds terrible. Alone, in a crowd, with no escape. It was torture. This is where you'll find your ghosts. So, do spirits just pop up around here all the time? It happens. Has anyone ever capture them on video before? The spirit doesn't wanna be seen. It won't let itself be seen. Why? Why would they wanna be seen? They're sending you a message. So, in your experience, are the spirits ever dangerous? It depends on the message. What are they trying to tell us? I've been telling you. Leave. Scared yet? No. This is bullshit. Corpses that move. Is this a ghost story or Walking Dead? I mean... ghosts that look like zombies? Not just ghosts, Dr. Death. Who's that? I've heard he was the vengeful spirit of an old Nazi who used to torture his patients to death. Well, I've heard that he's actually an escaped mental patient who's been living here since '85, eating pigeons, and sometimes even people. Well, you're both wrong. Dr. Death's been around for longer than anyone could remember. You know, they say he haunts these corridors, stirred by the blood of the living. Oh, awesome! Hey, kid! Kid! Kid! Have you seen my friends? Kid! Kid! Have you seen a white van? Kid! Kid! One guy and girl, kind of like you two, actually came up here one night and didn't tell anyone where they were going. And they never made it out. So, what did you hear from them? Nobody knew where they went? When they looked at the bodies, carved into the skin... was "Dr. Death was here." If that happened, then why didn't we see it on the news? Jasmine, do you watch the news? MTV News. That's why. Why didn't they just call the cops on their cell phones? Look at your cell phone right now. -No bars. -Exactly. There's no service for at least a mile around here. I think there's some payphones somewhere, though. If things really were that freaky, why didn't they just leave and come back with police officers? And the police would have believed them? They never believe that supernatural shit. Yeah. In the movies. Well, this isn't a movie. And the cops wouldn't have gotten there in time anyway. Besides, what makes you think they'd be able to leave, -even if they wanted to? -What? Well, the ghosts can do whatever they want. Seal this place up nice and tight, so that you couldn't go anywhere unless they let you. Whoa! Wow. Guess who just earned his cash bonus? Well, hello there. Hi. Megan? Jesse? Weird caretaker guy? Everybody wants ghosts. I'll give you ghosts. You want ghosts? I'll give you ghosts. Enough ghosts. A lot of ghosts.

Who the hell are you? I'm your doctor. And I'm here to help you. What the hell is that thing? What-- Why am I tied up like this? Huh? One thing at a time, my boy. You do understand that your time here at Pennhurst is probably gonna be the most valuable experience someone in your condition could have, don't you? What is that thing? What are you doing? I'm just trying to figure out whether or not you're ready to embrace therapy. Or do you still wanna play your silly little games? Games? Hey, look, just let me out, you fucking psycho. Now, you see? Bad attitude. But that's okay. I'm here to help you. Because I'm your doctor and I love you. You love me? Oh, fuck. You motherfucker! Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, I get it. I get it. Okay, I get it. I'm sorry. Okay? Start over? Whatever you want, okay? Tell me what is it you want. You want money? I got money, I got so much money. You can have it all, right? You love me, right? You want sex? Is that what-- That's cool. Okay? In college, I once blew a professor just to get a C on Modern European-- How do you feel? -You feel better, huh? -Fuck you. You ready to play by the rules? No? Aw. Huh? Oh! That's a real shame. I had high hopes for you. Please stop, please stop, please stop. Hmm. Well, we try our best. Can one of you guys please answer your walkies? This is Badger's? Hmm, yes, it is. And it's still rolling. He's gotta be close. Badger? Good morning, sunshine. What the fuck is going on? What the fuck do you want with me? Let me out of here, man. Now, that's not the attitude to have. What the fuck do you want? Take off this strap. You know, that's the problem I have with you. I don't like your language. Hmm? Now, I'm gonna have to stick to drastic measures. Drastic measures? What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that! What are you doing? Now, I know this must look scary to you. But it's actually quite simple. And rather efficient. The procedure I'm about to do is called a transorbital lobotomy. Mm-hmm? - Oh, yes. - What are you doing? What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? - What the fuck are you doing? - No! Oh, baby, oh, yes, that's more like it. Perfect. How does that feel? Hmm? Hello? Anybody home? That worked. Hmm. I see you're upset. I'm sorry to worry you. We have a very strict policy about our patient safety. The sad truth of the matter is that there are many times that they are in danger of hurting themselves, and we have to protect them from themselves. You have to trust me here on this. It's for the best. - No, no, no. - Come on, hey. Are you all right? Are you all right? How does that feel? I'll be back later. We'll try it again. That's Sarah's camera. Oh, no. This is getting scary. Should we call the police? I'm sure they're fine. But I don't have any reception at all. All right. Let's go upstairs and look for them. Guys, this is the room. Yeah. - Love this. - Yeah. So love them. The fatal faithful room. Who cares? Well, this is the room where the guy got his nuts chopped off. Hello? You got to help me. I'm in a... - Please help me. - Of course. -Of course, I can help you. -Okay. As your doctor, I'm morally obligated to help you. What are you talking about? But you understand... Get me out of here. ...we can't have patients running around, making babies with other patients around here. What the fuck are you talking about? - Get me out of here. - Now, listen. You got to help me. - Of course, I will. - You got to help me. Calm down, I will help you as soon as we get you fixed. Okay? It's a simple procedure really. -Just... -What are you doing? ...hold still. What are you doing? I don't wanna nick you. Wait. What are you doing? No. No! Oh. That worked. How would cutting off a guy's scrotum make him less crazy? My balls make me crazy. Do you ever wash them occasionally? That's so not cool. How could a bro do that to another bro's junk? Beware of the junk snipper. He lurks these hallways, he'll cut off your wiener. If you have one. What the fuck? And no, it wasn't the fucking junk snipper, Jake! Well, maybe it was Dr. Death. Or one of his victims, trying to escape. It's probably just the wind, guys. Maybe we were just getting all the... currents converging on this spot. I bet it happens every night. It scares the shit out of... ...little kids. It's not a ghost. It's, like, when the doors shuts in your own house on a windy day. It's all-- All right. I don't know physics. But what the fuck was that, genius? Well, that sounds like a psychopathic, ghost murderer, scraping rusty blades to get us. -Wanna check it out? -Okay. Hey, guys, meet back in the hallway where we came in. Aren't you afraid of Dr. Death? Please! That's just a story. I mean, it's a true story, but those sounds weren't him. Now, if you're done interrupting, I can finish the story. And it might be the last time you guys get a chance to hear it. Sarah! Badger! Elden? Maybe they're high again. I hate it when he does that shit. Scott! What's that smell? Isn't that the morgue? Scott. He's fucking dead. I told you you shouldn't be here. He's right. - We gotta find everybody else. - You get us out of here. This is locked! No! Goddamnit! Fuck this! -Megan, no! -I will kill you. No! Megan, come on. I can hear you, I can fucking hear you! Show yourselves! Show yourselves! Come and get me! Hello? We're at Pennhurst. Someone's trying to kill... Damn it! Megan, it's Willard. Come on. I thought you said this is the safest way out? We should leave this place now. Badger, Scott's dead. We have to go. We have to go. We have to go! - Sarah! - Keep moving. -Keep moving. -Sarah! Just go, keep going. Wait. No, no, no, why are we going down? Down is the only way out now. -Where's Willard? -He was just right there. Oh, my God! No! Go. Go! Go, Megan! What are you doing here? How did you get here? I've always been here. Who are you? What are you? I'm trying to help you. We're all trying to help you, to protect you. Protect me from what? From them. I don't know what's going on, but I just wanna get out of here. What is that? Willard, no! I was killed by the people who were supposed to take care of me years ago. Pennhurst is my home. Just like you, Chris. You know my name. Willard, you're a ghost? Chris Benham was the last patient released from Pennhurst. He was barely 18 years old. No family would take him in. No friends, nobody. Pennhurst was the only home he ever knew. Its time, Chris. I'm not like you. I'm helping these people. I'm not like you! I'm not-- It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. The spirits weren't trying to hurt us, they were trying to protect us. Ladies, are you sure there's five bodies in there? Yes. I'm only counting four. Well, let's get down to the hospital, get you guys checked out. Let's go to that door. I don't like being alone down here, do you know where you're going? Let's forget about this, can we just go? Guys, just chill out. - It's nothing. - Where are they? Cody, get the fuck down here. -I'm not kidding! -Jenny! This is not funny, this is not a funny joke! Where the fuck are you guys? - Coming! - Hi, guys! Oh, Jesus! This isn't funny! We do not want to be here all night. -Let's get out of here. -I'm sorry. Whatever happened to the film crew? Never heard from again. - Dr. Death got them. - That's not funny. Well, it's just how it happened. You're real. Shit! - Get them up? Great. - Yup. We're back here at Pennhurst State School Asylum. We came back, we were here a couple years ago, and we had some really interesting findings. So, as a result, we came back again, because we're trying to disprove some of those with more information and background. As you know, Pennhurst was a mental asylum, and it was used to house a lot of the criminally insane in the area. And, unfortunately, the nature of the business, it just so happens that a lot of the patients are brutalized, victimized, taken advantage of. And, unfortunately, that's just how it is. That's what it is. Is that blood? Sure is. All right, guys, this isn't right. - Holy shit! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - What happened? -Oh, my God! -That is brutal.
