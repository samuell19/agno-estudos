Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland High above the arctic circle A group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper But what they unearthed was a story A story that was to terrorize the whole world When the events began that were to place a burden of decision Involving the lives of an entire city on my shoulders I was far away. Unsuspecting. Unknowing. Hold it. It's Blood! What are we stopping for? There's blood on the drill. Okay, shut it off. It's a piece of skin. Like Leather. Bones? Fossil Bones. What kind of thing is down there? I don't know...but I intend to find out. Alex, get the generator going. I want to use the radio. Okay. You'll suspend the drilling until I find out what this is all about. If there's any copper down there, it'll have to wait. Henry, as an American, you have drilled all over the world. What do you make of it? It can't be a living thing. Let it be. There's gotta be some explanation. Well, it's out of our line. I'm going to radio Narvik, the University of Copenhagen. We'll need a paleontologist. I wonder if even they can find the answer. We'll find out soon enough. Get the Polaroid. We'll get ourselves some pictures, right away. Okay on the radio, Sven. Got it? Sure. Come on, then. Let's get on that radio. Okay on the radio, Sven. Got it? Sure. Come on, then. Let's get on that radio. Within hours, two Danish scientists had joined the mining engineers. Prof. Mardens from Copenhagen's Danmarks Aquarium and his associate, Dr. Peter Dalby. As well as a third man, Hans Kaarlsen, a newpaper reporter. The two scientists had examined the startling find, hidden beneath the frozen tundra, And brought up by the drill bit. They'd reasoned out the meaning of the gruesome puzzle. wihtout ever dreaming of its full, deadly secret. Actually, what we have is easily explained. Our test borings show... that the fossilized bones of some large creature lie buried near the surface. How would you explain the fresh tissue and blood? Dr. Dalby and I have discussed that. There is a tundra under the ground. Parts of the animal must be contained in it and frozen. Mammoths and other animals have been found under the same conditions in Siberia. What we found wasn't frozen. It was fresh blood. Your drill-bit probably penetrated the deep-frozen animal. Friction from the drill has thawed it out. That's how to explain the blood. Well, then. There's certainly nothing remarkable in this affair. On the contrary. All the animals previously found like this were mammals. The piece of skin you found, and the apparent size of the creature, have convinced us that it must be a reptile. - A giant reptile? - Yes. And that is quite unique. In the morning, I will send everything to the Aquarium in Copenhagen, - Where we can study this find. Alright, alright, Lise, we'll find a spot for your funny Mr. Peeps. Thank you, father. We'll need a watchmen, anyway, with Sven's fossils here. Don't spend all your time with those old fossils, father. You might become one. With two daughters like you and Karen, it's a pleasure to retire to my old bones. Good morning, Dr. Marden. Eh. Good morning, Professor. Eh. Good morning. Good day. Here's the latest list of bone fragments, Dr. Dalby Thank you. Peter, are you still trying to master that jigsaw puzzle? I tell you, Otto, I won't give up. It's got to be done. But it is useless. It's impossible to reconstruct. I don't know why. We've certainly got enough bones to work with. Too Many. I'm not convinced they all of them belong to the same animal. - But I am. - Then it's like no other ever found. Dad, there was a telegram back home. Ah. It's from Svend, the young engineer. Oh? He has found another piece, about 600 meters away. He's bringing it here. He'll be here in about an hour. Good. Karen, pick him up at the airport. - Is he handsome, father? - No... Three eyes, and a false mustache. Hurry now. I don't want him to wait. How will I know him? Since when must I tell you how to find a man? Now, no side errands. Bring him back directly. Maybe Svend will bring us the piece we need. I've really never seen bone fragments like this before. Well, what's so unusual about the bones? They are resilient. But very strong, almost like the cartilaginous bones of a shark. What about that frozen piece? We have freed it from the muck. Looks like the tip of the creature's tail. Come here. We are keeping it frozen, of course. Take a good look. From the size of that piece, we've calculated that the creature must have been huge. - How big would you say? - In a class with the largest of prehistoric creatures. 30 meters or more. A giant dinosaur. Peter...we have an absolutely unique find here. Mmm-hmm. A perfectly preserved specimen of a reptile, 70, perhaps 100 million years old. Think what we can learn from it! Forget the bones. Let's concentrate on this. Father, now that Svend knows enough about frozen things. Can't I thaw him out a little and show him around? You must stay with us while you are here. We have an extra room. - How long can you stay? Father, here's Mr. Petersen; he's all set. Karen. Please don't frighten that young man. You know she is really quite dangerous. But don't worry. I'll go along as your chaperone. - Otto, I envy that young man... - Yes. He will be busy now - Oh, yes. Oh, good. I'm glad you could make it, Petersen. - Dr. Darby. - Glad to see you. Mr. Petersen will help us keep an eye on things. He'll be staying here. Someone should be here when we're not around. -Good idea. - Sure. Anything fishy going on, I'll look into it. Thank you, Petersen, thank you. Dr. Dalby will explain your duties later. Most important is this freezer. It must always be kept at the same temperature. - Sure, Doctor. - It's all powered electrically. - Later, you must see the machinery. Sure thing. - In the meantime, why don't you get settled. I'll do that! Electric eel. Hello, hello. Yep. I guess everything runs on electricity around here. - Oh, Peterson. - Just Doing my rounds, Doctor. - I'll be working here most of the night. I'll Look after things here. - Okay. - Good night, Doctor. - Good night, Petersen. And your Mr. Petersen is inspecting everything. - That's what I told you, Father. He's so curious. You mu... - Yes, yes, I know. Dr. Dalby. Ohhh...something's happened. Peter! Peter ...! -What happened? -Ohhh, I must have fallen asleep. Ohh, Dr. Dalby, you really scared me so much! Father... Unfrozen! It's thawed out. Ruined! Where is Petersen? Let Me get my hands on him! It's not Mikkelsen's fault, Otto. I sent him home. It's my fault. Do you realize what you've done, Peter? The tissues are completely thawed out. Decomposition must already have begun. Even if we refreeze it, the tissues will never be the same! Father...Dr. Dalby, look at the wound. It looks different, doesn't it? It's healing. Otto! Look at the surface, here. Granulation! Do you realize what this means? You've let it thaw out, and now ... now it's alive. Welcome, Miss Miller. We are not accustomed to seeing uch a beautiful woman associated with science. My appearance has nothing to do with my skills. No insult, Miss Miller, no insult. But allow me to express my admiration without being misunderstood. - I guess I'm a little sensitive. - I hope you enjoy your stay here. I'm here for a job. Unesco appreciates your invitation. If your report can be verified, it opens up terrible new possibilities. Actually, we're expecting another representative from the UN: - A countryman of yours, a general. His name is, uhh... - Grayson. Brigadier General Mark Grayson. Pleased to meet you, General. Our little Denmark is not used to being so honored. I don't know why I'm here, Professor. I assume you'll let me know. Yes, General. We have a demonstration and a news conference for the press in just a few minutes. I think many of your questions will be answered. Please allow me to introduce you... This is Miss Miller - from UNESCO. - American, Miss Miller? - Yes, General. - How do you do? - This is my daughter Lise. I'm pleased to meet you, General. I hope you enjoy your stay. Thank you, Miss Martens, but I'll be happier if my stay is short. No offense meant. And so, ladies and gentlemen. I've invited you here... to see for yourselves one of the most amazing events - ever to take place in the annals of... General Grayson? May I introduce Captain Brandt? He'll be your liaison officer. - It's a pleasure to welcome you, General. - Thanks. Let's hear what Martens is saying. And there is no doubt: It is alive! It's growing amazingly quickly. It's already doubled its original size. The tail fragment is in a tank in the next room. We've added a nutrient substance. It's actually a kind of regeneration chamber. What do you mean by "regeneration"? Regeneration is the ability of living tissue to rebuild itself, or heal a wound. This capability is highly developed in certain animal species. In scientific terms, there nothing unusual about it. A lizard may lose its tail when it's frightened, and grow a new one. A starfish can lose an arm, and a new arm will grow. An earthworm can be cut into two parts, and each piece will grow into a new worm. Including such complicated organs as its brain, eyes, and digestive system. And that is what is happening here: What do you call the creature? I don't yet know what it will grow into, apart from the fact it's a reptile. Why not call it Reptilicus Martensius? Reptilicus is enough. Reptilicus it is. And now, ladies and gentlemen. If you want to see it, it's this way. "The UN has placed all of its scientific knowledge at the disposal of the Danish government." "And General Mark Grayson, well- known from the Second World War," "has been given command of the defense forces." General Mark Grayson, in command of 2 captains, - 3 office boys, and a dead lizard. Ooh! Eee! No! Oww! Mother! Mo-o-o-m! - Everything's all right, Petersen. - What? Bu-but... - But I heard it move! - Yes, I'm sure you did. Yes, but Reptilicus han't yet come back to conscious life. What you heard was a spontaneous embryonic movement. Uh, sure. You-you-you're right. - If ever anything happens, just let us know. - Oh...okay. Okay. It seems to be totally unlike any other dinosaur. Huge bony scales along his back. Though incredibly thick, the legs are hardly formed, as yet. There is a slimy secretion from glands in his maw. It has a burning, corrosive effect. Like strong acid. Dr. Dalby, as I commanded, let the flow of nutrients be increased. We shall try it. But if Reptilicus grows much bigger... We will have to build a new tank. Come in. Yeah. Get me transferred out of this damned place. I think, General, if you just visit the city you just might learn to like it. I took Captain Brandt's suggestion. He was right; I needed a change of pace. I even persuaded Connie to come along. It was a bright move; she was a charming companion. Look, Mark, the little mermaid. How lovely. - It is a beautiful city. - Yes, it is. There's the King's castle, Amalienborg. And the Royal Guard. - What a beautiful fountain. - That's the Goddess Gefion. - Hauling Denmark out of the Scandinavian peninsula, according to legend. - Look at that traffic! So many bicycles. - They say the Danes were born on bicycles. - I know! And then thrown into the water to learn to swim. - That's Neinrau isn't it? - Right! - By the way, I asked Brandt to meet us, later -Why?

Hello? Hello? Petersen. Petersen! Petersen. Go get the police. And bring them back immediately. - Olsen, it's moving! It's alive! It's loose! - Come in, Petersen. Come on, we have to get there as fast as possible. - Oh. - Now see what you've done. - I'm sorry. - What's all this about, Petersen. - What happened? The electricity's out all over. - All over. - Yah! Even the electric eel! - Then what? - Then it was so dark, I couldn't see my own face in front of me. - I wish I could be that lucky. Mr. Petersen. Then what happened then? There was just a big hole in the wall. The monster is loose! Yah, Sure, sure, sure. Why don't you tell all that to Dr. Dalby? I can't. He's the one that sent me here in the first place! - Why sure. - Yah. - Dr. Dalby? - They didn't find any trace of him. What happened? Reptilicus must have undergone a tremendous growth spurt. - He's come out of hibernation. - How could it be? I don't know. Maybe the electrical charge of the stormy weather? Perhaps the increased supply of nutrients. I've followed its tracks. They led down to the shore and disappeared. All right, Captain. We've got a fight on our hands. I want to set up HQ in the city. Where do you suggest? The barracks of the Royal Guards. [On radio] Area "F", Area "F", This is field headquarters. All units report! Over. Ah. No. There'll be no need. Yes! Ten minutes. Alright. Alright, gentlemen ... You all have your orders. I'll work with the army, through Capt. Brandt. Commander Svensen you'll stand by for any naval action required. And the Chief of Police must handle the evacuation of the populace. Professor Martens and Svend Alstrup will be my scientific and technical advisors. Any questions? Carry on, gentlemen. - Brandt, I want that radio manned 24 hours a day. - Right. General Grayson. Where? Stay out of his way. We're leaving at once. -Brandt, red alert! - Where? - Small farm on the coast. - What happened? - It killed 14... - 14 of my best heifers. - Did you see it? It was mighty big. Huge. It destroyed my barn and disappeared over there. - That area. Has it been sectored? - Yes! Alright. We'll surround it, comb it, if he's in there, we'll get him. You'd better get everybody out of here, in case he comes back. - Control. - Control. This is Brandt. Entering "E" sector, over. This is control. We'll rendezvous sector "E". Area 4. Over and Out. Come on, Svend, let's go. Cars 7 and 9, follow me. The others, go that way. Mark, look over there! We'll go this way. Control, Control! This is Brandt. We've found it. It's ... My god! Let's go, Svend. Machine gun in position. There. Attention all units! RAR! Get your field pieces into action. Spread out! Shoot from all sides. Fire when ready. Give him everything you've got. Be ready to get out of here in a hurry. Cease firing. Cease firing. We didn't even dent him. - Those bony scales are like armor plate. - It's headed for the beach. - We're gonna need a bigger cannon. - If that'll do it. Wait. There's another way... Can we get to the beach before he does? - We can try. - Report to Captain Brandt. Brandt. Come here. - We beat him down here. -He can't be far away. - Is he coming here? Yes, if he keeps on going toward the beach. There he is. Come on, come on. Where is that equipment? Mark! He's returned to the sea, sounding, like a wounded whale. Perhaps it's so badly injured it will die. No, Reptilicus would just go lick its wounds. - Regeneration? - Soon it will return. So it's a cross between one of these animals and a flying lizard. More than that. nature went through a long period of experimentation. some 70 million years ago I believe Reptilicus is one of nature's attempts to bridge the step from reptiles to mammals. Whatever he is, we have to destroy him. But first, it must be found. That's not going to be easy, as long as he stays underwater. He is not, essentially, a sea creature. He must come up to breathe, occasionally. Professor Martens, I understand the Aquarium has a motorboat... With an underwater television camera. We do. We use it to study the sea bottom. I want to install it on one of the navy's vessels. Yes, sir. I suggest you concentrate your search on the shore next to Aquarium. Why, doctor? Because Reptilicus will undoubtedly return to the Aquarium. Instinctively, it will feel attracted to this place. We're counting on you to find him for us. Anything new? - It's been almost a week. - Why don't you go home? Take it easy for a while. - I prefer to stay here. - You're stubborn! Other people are stubborn. I am firm. Rich, unidentified object found on bottom. Check your screen. Wilco, and out. Hey, look! There it is! Watch-Captain Nielsen calling. Reptilicus observed in shallow water. Awaiting further orders. -Commander Neilsen's calling, sir. - Put it on the PA. I repeat, Reptilicus observed in shallow water. Awaiting further orders. -This is Neilsen calling. - Grayson here. Execute Plan A. Execute Plan A. Come to course 2-5-0. Signal attack run. -Go get him, Neil. - We'll go now. Forward battery ... fire! Second battery ... fire! - Mark, are they bombing him? - Of course. This time we'll get the monster. - Don't you realize what you're doing? - Connie, stay out of this. Second battery ... fire! If the monster is blown into bits, it will regenerate itself. Each piece will grow into a whole new monster. Watch-Captain Nielsen, this is Grayson. Stop the attack. Cease firing. Attack discontinued. Returning to port. Out. What do we do, now? Can't we do anything while it is under water? No. I wanted to get him while he was still injured. We'll have to wait for the right moment, I know, when the creature is fully recovered. Until Reptilicus chooses to fight us again. Alstrup. Yes? Yes ... Right away, yes. - What is it? - It's your father. He's been taken to the hospital. He's had a serious heart attack. Come on... I'll take you to him. No. ... Connie, go with her. I've got work to do. Mark, you really must call it a day. It's past 10. I'm just about finished. It's been two weeks, and you haven't budged from this place. - Let him sleep. He's been knocking himself out. - Still no news? We've got a ring of observation posts. Reptilicus can't get out of the area without us knowing it. Martens says that the creature could turn up any time now. - I know. How is the professor? - Getting along fine. - Good. - Mark, the creature has been spotted! - Where? Skipper, a Swedish trawler reported him here, He capsized a freighter. Reptilicus was on the rampage. We never saw him. But we saw the trail of death and destruction he left behind. There! Just there in the Sound! He's dived down again. - That's near the Aquarium. - Your father was right. - The creature does seem to return to that spot. It would have to be right in our own back yard. -Any further damage reports? -Another fishing village, here. Destroyed. Two Swedish harbors. Several freighters in the Baltic Sea. - What is it, Svend? - Harbors, freighters...what next? I had the blood of the monster on my hands. Sometimes I feel that I have all those other people. - No, Svend. - I wish I had left it alone. - Oh, you don't mean that. - Still, I found the thing. - And father brought it here. Any man would have done what you did. 83, 19 8 "A" Sector, 17 4 "B" Sector, 14 6 "C" Sector, 47 3 "A" Sector. Attention, Attention! This is an important announcement to everyone in Copenhagen. Do not panic. I repeat, do not panic. Again, I repeat, stay off the streets and maintain a complete blackout. There is no reason to be afraid. The military has everything in-hand. 9 "D" Sector. 22 12 "F" Sector. Reptilicus last observed coordinates 33 19. Present position unknown. Repeat Unknown. Out. Condition: Red. - Ready for action, sergeant? - Yes, sir. - Cover that sector. -Yes, sir. Drive on, soldier. There he is, over there. Reptilicus approaching the city.\Repeat, Reptilicus approaching the city. This is Grayson. All Units. All Units. Fire at will. He's already reached the outskirts of the city. The armament we can bring into action against him is now limited. No bombs, no heavy artillery. - Field Commander, use flamethrowers, use flamethrowers. - Flameworthers negative, Flamethrowers negative. They report they can't use the flamethrowers. They can't get close because of the acid slime. Alright, we'll take other measures. Where is he now? Halfway across Emiar Island, headed for the canal. Langerbridge! Let's go! Tell Brandt to go to the troops down there and take command himself. You and I'll return to headquarters. We must set up the emergency ward, then. Most of them are victims of that burning acid slime. We only have one chance. We know from experience we can't lick Reptilicus with our small arms and field pieces. We'll have to drive him out from the densely-populated area into open country, And then clobber him with our heavy stuff. - He's...here now. - The Stock Exchange. Brandt, will have to deploy his firepower so we can force the creature onto one definite route out of the city. - The destruction will be terrible. - We have no choice. Get me Captain Brandt. -Brandt here. -Bring your ack-ack guns into action. - Yes, Mark. -We've got to try some heavier stuff. - Ack-ack fire on the double! To the right, to the right! He's coming this way! Fire! Fire! He's still coming! Stop it! Stoooooop! We've done it, it worked! He's leaving the city! He's turning back! - Get Captain Brandt. Tell him to report here. - Yes, sir. That's the line. Brandt? I'll want a concentration of real firepower, all along here. You'll get it! Reptilicus is headed for the suburbs. We have to prevent him from returning to the city. Brandt, this is important. No one along this line... I repeat, no one... ...is to open fire on the monster Unless it tries to return to the city. - And then only on direct orders. - Right. I think we can turn him. But only if everyone opens fire at the same time. - Captain Brandt! - Yah? Hold your fire...that's an order! Fire! - It's broken through the line. - What happened? - Somebody opened fire against my orders. The creature went after them before Brandt could bring any concentrated firepower to bear. - Are you evacuating the city? - It's impossible. We're getting as many people out of his way as we can, but he is unpredictable. - Are the streets passible? - Many are blocked. There's panic. Fires. We've got to stop him! What if I use my heavy bombs? It will cost thousands of lives. You can't do that. We cannot use bombs, in the city or anywhere. General Grayson, You have to understand ... Reptilicus must not be blown into pieces. Then how should I destroy it? Not with explosives. I am a soldier, not a scientist. That's the only way I know. - So you must learn another. - All right, then tell me. It is not important how. It is important that he be destroyed without scattering him to the four corners of the earth. I don't know how. Then we'll do it my way. You want to blow him into 1000 pieces? We'll pick up every little piece and destroy them. How are you going to find them all? Better 1000 tiny fragments than one giant monster. What about 1000 giant monsters? Can you guarantee that you will find all the pieces? How long do you expect me to continue this hell? He's getting more difficult to control. He seems to know we can't hurt him. But we'll keep trying. Out. -Take over. - All right Sergeant. Get going. - How is your father? - They gave him a sedative. Karen is with him. - What about Reptilicus? - If only we could sedate it. - Anesthetize it? - Just joking, Mark. No, wait. You've hit on something. Is there a drug that can knock Reptilicus out? Yes, but we'd need at least 1 liter of it, and we'd have to get it into his bloodstream. - How could you possibly do that? - Never mind that now... - Can we get enough of it? - I think we can manage that. -Where? - They'd have everything we need At the University laboratory. If we knock Reptilicus out, your father can destroy him, right? Yes. - One liter? It is impossible. - I have an idea. - You'll have to help me. - Yes, of course. What is it? I'll tell you on the way to the University. First we have to get ahold of someone who knows about these drugs. Have them meet us there. At once! I used to work at the laboratory. - Captain. - Yes, sir. - Get to ordinance. - Yes, sir. Lise knows the University labs inside and out. We're going with you. - Yes, Svend. - Here's what I want you to pick up. -Yes, sir. Bring it to the University laboratory immediately. - Have you been in contact with Brandt? - Not yet. Tell him I am at the University. Okay! RAR! RAR! - Now what? - Now we take a crack at Reptilicus. The bazooka rocket. Svend has removed most of the explosive — - And replaced it with a drug... it will knock him unconscious. If we can get it into his bloodstream. But his scales are as thick as armor plates. How ...? There's one place: his mouth. So you'll have to fire point blank. I know. He's just coming into the town hall square. If we can intercept him there, we can get close enough for a shot. And we'd better not miss. We've only got one rocket. There he is! Get the shot! Go back, Brandt! - I may be needed. - Go back! This is an order! If we fail here, we'll need you. He's turning away! Now we'll have to outflank him. No, we must get to him before he gets out of the square. No, Brandt! Noooo! > SQUISH He's coming back this way! He's in position. Load. It's a good thing, that there's no more like him.
