Government? Sons of bitches... Who made it anyway?... They even killed Kim Ku, and l couldn't die when l should have Since then, l lived each day hoping it'll be my last Since that day... that day... Shanghai On that day, l was to die l set fire to Japanese houses whenever l could lt was to avenge my parents' death And then l got caught Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts Today, we are here to execute the principal offenders, these Chosun people You should be witnesses to today's execution, and spread the word How reckless and foolish it is to fight against the Great Japanese Empire Many arsons and murders occurred in Japanese districts Here are the villains... of political and other sorts... to be publicly executed They were anarchists That was how l met them Here's where you'll be trained Look closely This is Majaal, who makes the bombs and weapons for us Hey, don't touch my knife! That's right. That's the way Where are you pointing at? You're driving me nuts! Black looks good on Sang-Gu! Like a bell boy at the club Yeah, he's the bell boy Do you know why we prefer black clothes? lf the socialists are red then anarchists are black Throughout history we only wore white, a sign of weakness And we should mourn for our old timers, right? l wear it 'cause l like black Wow! Looking good, huh? Listen! Keep straight and don't breathe Look at me when l'm talking! Hello LingLing! How 'bout a hug today? LingLing Light them up well with the mirror Why we always have to take our pictures from him? lt's too damn dull Still, Mr. Wang's the only one to treat us with dignity Ready? One...two... Three! Hey, get up for a minute. Get up, l said Try reciting our declaration People are our principal spirit of revolution Louder! People are our principal spirit of revolution Violence is our only weapon of revolution With our people, we will overthrow the Japanese rule With assassination, destruction and rebellion. We... We will rebuild our tortured life under Japanese rule And as a first class society there will be no suppression Without any, without any oppression to our fellow men, We will build an ideal Chosun nation... That day, l was officially accepted into the group Hi Seregay Hey they sure look silky My! Why do girls always like his kind. Drives me crazy! Wow! Let's stuff ourselves to death Drink up! Those bitches sure know how to roll their hips around Sang-gu, do you see those Japs, over there? That's Minami Soja. He's been dispatched to Shanghai To the right is Gato, his pawn ln front of him is the cold-hearted Kuboda You'll meet them soon When should we kick their butts? Kaneko-san! Many foreigners are here ln Shanghai, there's a lot of armies from many countries So what if there are? We can crush those Japs and hide with the French So far, they're good to us, but they have their own moves Our provisional government is there too and it's best that we don't trust them too much What are we doing? Let's drink up for those buffoons The only buffoon here is you. Cheers! You idiot! You're an imbecile! Go outside to throw up if you don't feel well, Sang-Gu Seregay consoled his pains with opium They're beating him up! Give us the money now What are you doing? We want our opium money But did you have to... Seregay! Hey guys! Look who's here? lt's the Queen of the club! What do we have here? So! You got a knife? Let's see what you can do, you son of a bitch! Get lost! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! l'll take him home You're home late You have a funny hobby Well, yes, that is... You seem to turn the pages with perfume Oh, now what should l do? l was really saving it up... l hardly used it... Who told you to bring me here? Well, l'll see you later We'll get an order from above You just wait a bit, okay? Hey you! Look at me when l'm talking to you! Yesterday you got fancy food and you threw it all up And now you... You rotten bastard. You all right? Sang-Gu! Go and get the pictures from the photo shop Yes, sir Now eat, okay? Hello. How can l help you? Photos? Photos! Wait one minute Here... Photos ln the photo, you're not pretty You should smile Smile! No... Have a cup of tea Yes, sir Have you scrubbed yourself well? You could get sick without some scrubbing now and then Yes sir, l have l need to scrub off filth What do you mean? Please get to the point A while ago, Han Myung-Gon received some subsidy from Lenin 2 million rubles was delivered from Moscow to Shanghai But a 1 00,000 rubles of that just disappeared into thin air You mean, Kim Lib took it? Kim Ku already killed him Everybody's talking about it. lt's an issue for both parties Then is it true that Kim Lib's money went to Dan-Jae? Dan-Jae says he knew nothing, but he received 500 rubles to write 'The History of Chosun' The problem isn't the 500 rubles, but it's the missing 1 00,000 rubles The provisional government thinks that we took it all All the leftists, including Lee Dong-Hui, Shin Chae-Ho and Kim Won-Bong are all under suspicion lsn't it manipulated by the Rhee Seung-Man's side? That's why he broke off the leaders' meeting, didn't he? l heard that they couldn't find that money in the end Han Myung-Gon thought it was dangerous to carry it alone So he entrusted a part of it to some guy But that guy ran off to Russia to keep it for himself We finally found him Kill him and bring back the money ln two months, top Japanese officials will be in Shanghai Probably conspiring to take the rest of China ls that so? Wow! We finally got a big one for us Now we can make our names famous in history Dol-Suk, it's your turn l brought a guest. Please greet him A Minister of Provisional Government, Mr. Ahn Chang-ho l already spoke to your leader, Mr. Kim, and l advise you to stop your terrorism from now on Especially, the foreign settlements are absolutely forbidden We're risking our lives by sneaking into those areas And you want us to just watch those Japs kill our brothers? Why judge everything only by the things you know? Thanks to the protection from the foreign settlement officials, thousands of our people can be safe in the French districts So you'll keep bribing them with protection fees? Now the Japs will expand their power into these areas Then it'll be the last of diplomatic immunity Terrorism is barbarism, and it's internationally condemned We have to change our society through enlightenment Look, you think terrorism is all about guns and knives, but that's the decent part of it The Japs should be hacked to death Dol-Suk! Sir! Let me take care of that damn Governor-General l'll finish him with my blade Our guest is leaving Show him the way out You fellows think carefully about what l said Seregay, here's the photo and the address l'm standing here! Geez! What's wrong? Are you sick? My headache's worse Let's get it treated for good after you get back After l leave, you sleep with her Help me fall out of love Before a big kill, we always took a picture Since it could be our last moment alive One Two Three You know that dancing lady? That lady's your girlfriend? Am l right? But a gun is more reliable than a knife, right? lt depends on how you use it He's enormous Then there's plenty to stab at A Russian hooker went in She looks expensive l guess he's got the money Will you cut his throat or stab the heart? You want to be the next Sabinkov? Find out for yourself what killing is like l think a stab in the heart will be better The important thing is to avoid the ribs lnsert vertically under the left nipple Don't you miss home? Now it's not home anymore l heard you were from a royal family lt's been a while since l threw away my family name l saw you reading a very interesting book About anarchism lt's the ideology of the person that l love So you learned the language of the one you love? l was born in Chosun. My mother was a Chosun woman Will you give me the honor of a toast with the royal family? Seregay! Seregay! Seregay only sent me back We divided the money to reduce the risk But Seregay didn't come back And l came back eating only eggs for 7 days Our leader was furious and ordered us to bring him back The other members were sent We were completely excluded from the operation But with Lee Geun's efforts... Seregay was handed over to us Did you forget how he protected us when he was tortured? He's also very sick, and he's not himself You shouldn't have saved him without any authorization ln the end, you got in the way of his honorable death Since then, Seregay's wasted... Still, that's not fair! How can they tell us to kill a comrade? There are hundreds of members besides us You know that we're being harshly punished for them Why do you ignore that? You don't care about Seregay at all You care that it's humiliating since it happened to us! Let's stop it there Please take the life that you saved There's been a change of plans Seregay was a great fighter An activist who didn't need anything at all Maybe Seregay was never meant to be one of us l heard the gunshot from the opposite side l was afraid and the guys didn't know what to say Those who are here today have no right to mourn That's because we are still cowardly alive During last KwangDong earthquake, Japanese had mercilessly massacred thousand of our people With the remaining ashes of a Chosun fighter in front of us, l dare declare... He was in a such a bad state that we had to cremate him We found out that Minami, Gato and Kuboda did it For whatever it takes, we intend to seek retribution Let's renew our resolutions All members and officials of the Provisional government, please remain to take a photo in memory of today Everybody, look over here One, two, three Hey Kuboda! Where's Minami-san? l don't know You don't? ldiot! Oh, Kaneko-san, it's an honor for me, Minami What's the matter? Did you have to take advantage of Kaneko as well? What? l'm trying to relieve the sadness of a woman who... You made no scruples to attain your goals You're exploiting Kaneko Don't forget that hundreds of our people are dividing into nationalists or socialists How can we bring them together to fight our enemy? l'm talking about your coldness to use women in a revolution You said that a rebel is cold- hearted as well as passionate That terrorists are cold flames You, me, Kim Ku and Dan-Jae, we're being exploited for the revolution lsn't your judgment these days being obscured by a woman? You... What are you guys doing? For Minami's death, Kaneko was tortured By the despicable Gato and Kuboda, a Chosun national They just used you for their terrorist activities Do you know how Seregay died? They killed Seregay This is Seregay Hey! Look what we have here! Which hometown you from? l'll show you what a real Chosun man is like, okay? Lee Geun consoled Kaneko in place of Seregay The group silently accepted that she informed him about the Japs That's new What are you doing? lt's Seregay's Don't touch it What's wrong? l drank coffee from it lots of times ls this your place? Are you my husband? And please don't use that form of speech with me Why do Chosun men do that when they get acquainted? Use it on your Chosun girls l'm different. l'm Japanese Sorry. You call us Japs, right? l never thought of you as a Japanese woman before Why is only Seregay dead and not you as well? lf you're comrades and rebels, you should all live or die You hypocrite! Do you think there's any meaning to be alive? Christ, those two kissing away like they were long lost lovers Well, l guess she'll be going What's up, Dol-Suk? Oh! You're here. Want a cigarette? Huh, are you leaving? Let's have a meeting We've got important info on the new Jap's Consul General Wait! Stay still! You can't go out alive What happened? Shit! Listen to him, Kuboda Drop the gun Drop the gun! Do as you're told. Please! Let's go! Go away and listen to me Don't follow me Listen to them, Kuboda lt's no use running away Shut up! You son of a bitch! You're dead, you bastard Take it off. Off! You shit! What are you doing? To eat a boiled egg, you have to crack its shell No! What do you mean by no? We'd be no different from them. This is inhuman lnhuman? Animals don't do anything like this Then what's a human supposed to do? What are you supposed to do in a situation like this? Just kill him Kill? Now that's very human ls this all you learned while being tortured by the Japs? There's an informant among us lf we don't find out, then we'll collapse lt's not about choosing to be human him or not, but figuring out who you'll be human us or the enemy There's no choice lf l keep insisting then you'll be suspicious of me No, you've already started to be suspicious of me What are you talking about? Why didn't anyone tell me you were hiding in the bathroom? My great responsibility for... That's enough! l don't want to hear any more of it Who's the informant? l don't know. l just do what l'm told Bring the electric generator, okay? What's keeping you? l said get a move on it! lf you think you're right, shoot me Where are you going? ls Gato dead? Why'd you do it? Why betray like that? Betray? Wasn't it you who betrayed first? He was shot several times in the back, you say? There was no time for you to recover the body Then what was it that we buried? The real Seregay is right here So, it was all for this Yes. After killing the only man l loved, did you have to go so far as to use me to kill Minami? Tell me why the hell did we have that fake funeral? Was it to keep the truth from me? You punished a traitor and used a woman's grief for your cause You guys are geniuses What makes you different from the Japs? What gives you the right to ask about betrayal? What is betrayal, anyway? Leave Shanghai We hid out because there was a search warrant out for us lnsufficient subsidy, crude weapons and an informant... Many of our activities failed and we were falling apart We needed a new change... Even if you don't eat much, your hair sure grows fast So is that why your first love ran away? My first love, Chun-Mae She had the biggest breasts. So l... Ouch, it hurts Hey kid, sit! Come sit here, l said Sang-Gu! l'll be straight with you We decided to move to the leftists' base at Kwang-ju From now on, we fight for a collective rise of socialism Now, you'll be reborn as socialists at Kwang-ju We're anarchists Socialism is just another dictatorship What do you want, then? l want to work and take as much as l can Just as l expected. Well, you can't beat that But it's true that terrorism has no place here anymore l devoted my whole life to it You need ten years to match the number of people l've killed What's the use. They replace a Jap as soon as one goes down Even if we kill the Emperor, his son will take his place But terrorism is... All right. Do as you like Anyway, our leader won't be responsible for any more sacrifices of young patriots Please finish your meal l came down here not to serve nobles and Japs Do you know what my dream was? lt was to die like a hero with style in Chosun or Japan Forget orders! Just wipe them out. You just wait and see There's gonna be something really surprising Then all of you... So what are you going to do? l knew for a while that the age of socialism will come But as sick as l am, what could l do in Kwang-ju? And how could l lead others? l'll just stay here with my comrades Then you're all on your own Whatever you do next, don't mention our group's name Name isn't important to us There will be no more financial support after today's lunch Sang-Gu, do you know the original meaning of 'Anarchy'? ln Greek, it's 'Anarchia', 'anarcho' What does it mean? A group of sailors without a captain You bums! What are you doing there? Come over here Pay the rent The rent, l said l'm sorry ls that edible? Want some? Damn it! You can have all you want! l heard that 1 00 cooked carps will cure lung disease Sang-Gu, come with me You're sorry? You think our kids live on water? No matter what, l want my money Give me the money now! l'll give it to you later Don't try to trick me today. You understand? Hey, what's there to look at? This knife is from Arabia lt's my knife so l should know This knife is the real thing This is all l can give you What? Hey, do you know what kind of knife this is? Kid, what you doing? Take the money Place your bets lf you don't fall in one minute, get double lf you make him fall, we give 1 0 times the bet Shit, what's he saying? lf you hold out for a minute they give you double the bet lf you fall, then you lose What if l win? You get 1 0 times the bet Give me half of that money l never saw him fall once. Just give me the money God damn- it, you asshole! Come over here! Wait a minute! l'll be back What? Start! We won, eh? Hey, give it here. Sang-Gu, eat some more, okay? Hey kid, is your stomach getting greased up enough? This restaurant is the best and the most famous in Shanghai Eat all you want, huh? The guys must be hungry, too... Don't worry l got it all figured out This was delicious lf we get this for the guys, then... LingLing Where's your grandfather? He was arrested for being involved with the Chosun people We had to close the business lt was a cold and poor winter Just do as l tell you... l've had enough of it. Shut up! Why do you always do that to me? ls what l say that worthless? Are you out of your mind? Then you really want us to be petty thieves? Somebody else will do it even if it's not us What do you think, Han? Sang-Gu, you should listen too. Come sit here This Shanghai mob is looking for a new face We just hand over the drugs and get the money lt's enough money for our weapons and living expenses Anyway, everything will be over in a month, right? l think that... Be quiet! Who asked you to think? Leave the thinking to us You stop there! l'll tell you about my hometown. When my father worked as a servant on the farm, the landowner said l was an ignorant who didn't know what a sickle is So l took his sickle and slit his throat Bastards! l thought they were my comrades You don't know how important this is to me Sang-Gu, after this, you go off on your own l plan to do something on my own from now on Put your hands up! Hands up! Put your hands up and don't move You! You put this in, you bastards Stay right there! Turn around! Hey, l could've done it alone. Ah, shut up You could at least say thanks What's up with the clothes? lf you're small in number, always have an alternative plan What are you doing there? Come on That's not the way... What? lt's this guy! Now let's make them remember us For the old timers at the Provisional Government to see Let them have all the credit What good are they, anyway? ln 1 91 0, the traitors sold the government to Japan, Now, the minister of the Provisional Government are selling the pseudo-government Yeah, you're right! But Mr. Kim's different Kim Ku's struggling a lot to provide for the old timers Let's just eat. Hey! What's wrong? Kim Ku beat and killed Japanese officials, just like us Dol-suk! That was Mr. Kim Ku What's this? Oh, shit! Let's get out! ln a week, from Daedal Pier at Hwangpo River, a cruiser with Japanese officials will depart from here, then pass through lnchon and arrive at Tokyo Again, careful how you act Especially you, Dol-Suk Why do you always pick on me? But, will all the head Japs really be meeting there? The cruiser seems difficult We do a preliminary infiltration We make sure of the cruiser's structure and size in advance Even if we fail, dead or alive we will still make it to our homeland l hope all of you will take the risk l really miss my homeland Steamy bean soup and the girls, l just can't wait! But security must be tight There's less soldiers on the cruiser than on land There aren't many places for them to hide in Our worst scenario is sinking the cruiser Don't worry. l'll kill them with my bare hands, if l have to Please don't forget about me when you go back home And Sang-Gu! You just follow me Dol-Suk! Now, why'd he trust you out of all of us? Why do you say things like that? lt drives me crazy! And... Don't get so excited Hello! They were the best that we could find in weapons They were crude, but we were confident with that You'll have your lD papers at the rendezvous You know what to do, right? Whatever happens on the cruiser, we don't know each other Dol-Suk and l will attack first with pistols lf we succeed, then we can all safely go to lnchon lf we fail, the second team attacks Now we'll really do something for history, huh? Let's all go back home after this big kill, okay? We'll go to Seoul and make our way through What do you think of my opinion? l wouldn't let you down. l have a good feeling about this one Today will be our last day in Shanghai l'm sure we all have things to do Be especially careful of how you act and dress So is this the last time? Then what are we doing here? Anything fun to do? Yes, there is Hurry up Here we go! Ready? One, two... What's that expression? Smile! Hey, did she take it already? Did you take it? Yes.... Yes.... Good Write a phrase to put on the photo What's this? Life is heavy as mountains, but death is light as feather Let's split. We meet tomorrow morning at the rendezvous We split? Don't we all have things to do in Shanghai? Take care. l'll bring the car at exactly 8:00 in the morning We won't wait more than 1 0 minutes Later, you tell me what you did with LingLing, okay? You look like a monkey What's wrong? LingLing, l have to go tomorrow at seven Don't forget about me, and buy yourself lots of delicious stuff Consider yourself lucky! You go back to your hometown l said, go back! Have a good life Do you still think that l'm connected with Seregay's death? The things that we're doing, are they really our ideals? What do these things mean to us right this moment? The important thing is that we're together Let's leave the ideals and the dreams until after the mission Excuse me Kang Dol-Suk You're a petty thief disguised as a revolutionist You think killing a couple of Japanese people will bring independence to Chosun and make you heroes? Your ideals are over Even after their death, they could not return home. They failed, but they were still heroes... A revolutionist is like a gust of wind that blows towards this filthy world from a far away beautiful land When l got out of prison, it was after the independence The pro-Japanese Noh Duk-Sool became a police investigator He arrested and tortured Leader Kim Won-Bong He was accused of being a communist After three days of loathing, he went over to North Korea. Today, l am to receive a medal from the President of South Korea, Rhee Seung-man lt's an honor of my small contributions to our nation Does President Rhee deserve to give anyone the medal? Today, at the ceremony President Rhee and l will be meeting our fallen brothers Sang-Gu, do you want to try? Sang-gu take a look, they're all yours The Russian Revolution was achieved not by individuals but by the masses Sang-Gu, black looks good on you What matters is that we are together now There was an ideal land for us So free and pure that it could not exist in this world...
