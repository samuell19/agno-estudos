Mom, l can't sleep. Speak softly. Lala has just slept. -Whats wrong with you? -There is a man in my room. Ryan, it's just a bad dream. Look, your room is empty. There is no one here. Go to sleep. Ryan, you're a big boy now. You have to be brave. -''Lullaby song...'' -Mom, don't sing that song. -Why? -l'm scared. Scared of what? He's mean. l was looking for you. Ryan can't sleep. He wants me to be with him. Ryan, you're a big boy. You have to sleep on your own. Please don't. Mom... Help! 5 years later -Good afternoon Faculty Board Members. -Good afternoon. Let me use the opportunity to propose the subject of my thesis as a completion of my Psychiatry Master Degree study, with title ''Trauma Focus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy through EMDR''. EMDR proven to be the most effective method to cure patients suffering post traumatic stressed disorder or PTSD. As part of my clinical study, l use patient Ryan Saputra, a 12 year old boy who's been suffering from PTSD for the last 5 years, in which 5 years ago he witnessed all the family members got killed. l plan to conduct shock therapy and EMDR. And with your permission l would like to bring back him back to his old house under my supervision for a duration of 1 month. Within that time, l am confident l can cure him. Whats the news, Prof. Hardoni? -Dr. Karina, we have granted your proposal. -Yes. You may take the child. However, the board only gives you 2 weeks. Alright Prof. But remember, you have to report to me everyday, because the kid is still my responsibility. -Ok? -Understood Prof, l will immediately clean up the house. -Good luck. -Thank you, Prof. Ryan, come in. lt's alright. l have cleaned the house yesterday. Your room is upstair, right? Ryan. Ok, ok. Ryan, Ry, Ryan. Ryan. Ry... l found your doll. Bams, the father died right where you are sitting. Why are you so confident you will succeed, while other doctors before you fail? l brought him here so l can give him shock therapy so he can face his past and remember what happened. -When he is stressed, l will use EMDR. -What's that? While he is so stressed l will do this in front of his eye, and his eye is suppose to follow my hand. With the hope his brain will be distracted, so he will not think about the depressing thing all the time. So he can think about something else, and hopefully he will get better. ln America, many doctors have been using EMDR, and it works. What happened to this chair? Your room is upstairs. Why did you choose this one? No problem. -lt's not that l'm scared of staying here. But l got to go. -Ok, Bams. -l'll see you soon. -Take care. l can definitely do this. Definitely. Ryan, are you happy to be back home? What is it that you like to do here? Let me tell you a story. Do you want to hear it? One day, a boy was looking after his herds. Suddenly, he felt like playing a joke. He shouted ''Help, help, there is a wolf coming''. The entire village showed up to help the boy. But they didn't see any wolf around. Today is the first day Ryan is back home. l'm glad cause my effort so far has led my professors to have trust in me. l hope by bringing him back home, it's going to expedite my thesis. l want to graduate with top honors. l'm really tired today. Ryan... What are you doing outside? Why aren't you sleeping? Morning, Prof. Bams, why are you calling me so early? l'm still sleepy. l'm going back to sleep. What do you want Bams? Don't disturb me. Oh, morning prof. Sorry. l thought it was my friend who call. On the first day, Ryan was a bit quiet. Reading from his behavior, it seems like he's uncomfortable being back. But then l told him a story and it seems like he enjoys it. Ok, Prof. Yes, Bams. Relax, l'm going to count from one to ten. You will fall asleep. Let's start. One two three four, your eyes are getting heavy, five six seven eight nine ten. Ryan, tell me what did you feel when you entered this house yesterday. What did you remember from that night? Ryan... Ryan, calm down, Ryan. Breathe, breathe. Calm down. l'm going to count till three. You're going to wake up. One two three. Now follow the light with your eye. Definitely Ryan has gone through a very traumatic incident. Mentally, this boy can't cope with that and.... Why do you like to hold your breath? How are you today? Are you feeling better? Why is that? -l met... -Met? Who did you meet? Who did you meet? Lala. Lala? Lala, your sister? Where did you meet her? Ryan, you must be hallucinating. lt's not real. lt's only on your mind. Let's go up. Ryan, you have to fight your trauma. Let's go up. l'm with you. Ryan is still haunted by his past. He told me he met Lala last night. l'm sure he's hallucinating. He has blocked the tragic event that happened 5 years ago from his mind, so he thinks his family is still here. l watch him while he sleep. He can't sleep calmly more than two minutes. l have to find a way to watch him every minute. Hello Bams. How do you know l'm going to ask for help? This CCTV is connected to wifi. This wifi is connected to the internet. So, you can monitor Ryan from anywhere in the world. l'm going to London next week. ln the plane, on the elevation of 40.000 feet, l can still monitor. l have a phobia with heights. Especially with people who shows off. Ryan. Ryan, what are you doing? Are you alright? Ryan, what are you thinking about? Come with me upstairs. Come. Come. Come on, Ryan. Ryan, it's ok. You don't have to be scared. l'm here. Come on. Come on. Ryan, you have to be brave. Come on. -l don't want. -Ryan. He's there. Who's there? What are you scared of? l'm trying to help you. Who's there? Ryan! Ryan Saputra, 7 years old, goes through a tragic incident. Post Traumatic Stress disorder. Does not socialize with others. Very quiet. Can't sleep calmly. Don't sing the lullaby ''Nina Bobo''. lt seems like he's had traumatic incident in regard to the song. The trauma has to be treated immediately, but with subtle approach. Dr. Anwar Nasution, B. Hello, can l talk to Dr. Anwar? When is he back? Oh, next week. l'm Dr. Karina, please tell him to call me. This is regarding an old patient of his. Yes, thank you. Bams, l forgot to say thanks. You have helped clean this house. l don't mind at all. lt wasn't me. l paid someone to do it. But the second floor is still dirty. The people around here are scared to go upstairs after hearing stories about people dying up there. That's fine. We're not going up anyways. l'm going to blog first. Karina, Karina, Karina, Karina. Oh my God. Hello, Prof. Hello, hello. Hello. Hello, Prof. Bams. l'm going to sleep. You're not scared right? No. Bams. Karina, where are you? -Bams. -lf you're on the second floor, l'm not going up. -Bams. -Ok, l'm coming. Oh, that was so scary. Oh my God Karina, it's scary outside. Can l sleep here? -Alright, but sleep down there. -Thank you. -Bams, l'm so sorry. -Oh my God, Karina. Didn't you see me sleeping? But l told you to sleep that side last night. -7, 8, 9, 10. Ryan, what do you feel right now? -Scared. -Scared? What are you scared of? -Here. Here, in this house? What exactly happened in this house? Dad, dead, mom, dead, Lala... Did robbers come inside the house? Who killed your family? Ryan! Ryan! Ryan, calm down. Calm down! Bams! Bams! Bams! -Ryan, calm down. -Oh my God, Karina, what's wrong with him? -Ryan, Ryan. -What did you do to him, Karina? -l just hypnotized him. -Hypnotize? Ryan, look into my eyes. Hello, Prof. l'm sorry l haven't called you back. Ryan is improving. He is more communicative and more open. He is adapting very well. l'm sure by next week he will be back to normal. Yes, Prof, l'm not worried at all. lf Ryan cannot accept the death of his family, their spirits will remain here. People who die from a car accident, their spirit stays in the car. People who die unnaturally in house, their spirits will stay in the house. Please don't power suggest me. Why is ''leyak ghost'' only believed by people living in Bali? Because that is doctrine. Why is UFO only believed by people living in America? That is also doctrine. -Kar, l'm your bestfriend, right? -l'm your only friend, Bams. True, but you're missing the point. Don't talk to me like that, you bloody bastard. l have told you so many times. What? Who? Your aunty will help you? Bloody stupid man. lt's been a week and there has not been any improvements. What am l going to tell Prof. Hardoni? l'm not going home before l succeed. l'm going to succeed. Ryan will be cured. Why does he like to hold his breath? The reason is never clear. l'm fine. l haven't slept in three days. Why can't Ryan open up? l have tried everything and nothing has worked. Recently l have been hallucinating. lt must be because of Bams telling me those ghost stories. He's the one that has been affecting me with his ghost stories. Ryan, what are you doing? Why did you break the plate? l'm trying to sleep. Are you hungry? You want to eat? Are you scared of your dad? Are you scared of your mom? Are you scared of this house? -Hello. -Hello Karina, l'm Doctor Anwar. Hello Doctor. Thank you for calling me back. Right now, l'm handling one of your former patient, Ryan Saputra. Yes, how is he? Actually, there are a lot of things l want to ask you. But specifically, l want to know about your writings that warns not to sing the lullaby ''Nina Bobo''. l was his first doctor who treated him when he was 7 years old. He was very anti-social, but with my treatment he became better. But he always warns me not to sing the lullaby ''Nina Bobo''. l tried to sing it and that caused a major drawback to his recovery. What is wrong with that song? l'm not sure but l strongly warn you not to sing that lullaby to him. Yes, but isn't it very strange, Doc? l'm not going to experiment too far on a child that young. l strongly warn you not to sing the lullaby to that child. l'm not going to experiment too far on a child that young. Lullaby ''Nina Bobo...''. Many people told me not to sing the lullaby, including Ryan's first doctor. But l think that's wrong. There are no facts to suggest that the song will affect his mental stability. lnfact, if there's a trauma due to the song we should perform shock therapy so that he can face the problem. Tonight l sang the lullaby. And Ryan who never can sleep properly, this time he slept peacefully. This is my last effort. Let's see what happens in a few days. Last night, did you sing the lullaby? Ryan. l'm surprised that you come here. Have you eaten? Let me make you breakfast.. A breakthrough happened this morning. For the first time Ryan used full sentences to communicate. He asked me if l sang him the lullaby song last night. But how did he know l sang it? Bams, you texted me 200 times, what's wrong? Oh my God Karina, l've been trying to call you all night. By the way, l saw something in Ryan's room. Stop joking around. l know you're scared of ghost, but don't tell me there's something in Ryan's room. l don't believe you. Ryan slept nicely last night after l sang him the lullaby ''Nina Bobo''. Lullaby? Mystery behind the lullaby ''Nina Bobo''. A morbid story behind the lullaby. A child died unnaturally and the spirit lingers around for the song... Lullaby song... Karina, please come down. lt's not safe up there. Ryan. Ryan, what are you doing? Before 2 weeks l have succesfully made Ryan normal. lt's going to be a surprise for Professor Hardoni. My plan to use shock therapy and EMDR has succeeded to get Ryan out of his shell. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Surprisingly, Ryan still feels concern for my safety. Last night, he told me to come down as it was not safe upstairs. That means now he is able to socialize. l took him for a walk outside today. Seems like this is very important for his healing process. He is able to smile again now. l can already see myself getting the top honors. -Lullaby ''Nina bobo''. -Stop. Don't sing that song. -He will come. -Who do you mean? When l was small, after mom sings the lullaby, he will come and always ask me to play. He wants me to build him blocks and make houses out of playing cards. After some time, l became bored of it. He became mean. But then l found a way to hide from him. We have to close our nose and mouth, and not to breathe. That's why l have been practicing. But on that night, he was very angry. He killed everyone in the house because he couldn't find me. That's not possible Ryan. These past few days, l've been singing the lullaby and nothing happened... Karina! Karina, hold your breath. Karina, hold your breath. Karina! This way. lt's open. Come. Ryan, you go first. l can't fit in there. Go. -No, you go first. You can fit. -No, you go. Hurry! l don't want to. You also have to come with me. Go in. Fast. l'm going to distract him. -No, please come with me. -No, Ryan. You have to go alone. Hurry! Karina, Ryan! Oh my God, Karina, what happened to you? Ryan! Ryan! Dad, mom, Lala, rest in peace. Please, help her. Lullaby song Nina bobo. lt has 4 rooms, 2 upstair and 2 down here. Lets go see the room. -Where is the kitchen? -The kitchen is downstairs. This area has a nice view. Let's go see the room upstair. What is this room for? l'm not sure.
